by Michael Smith
n my . salad days as a
I ballplayer, some '1 years ago,
when l was shortstop and cap—
tain ot the Meadow Hoad Mets, the boy
who could hit the long ball was not
necessarily held in high esteem. He
was called a slugger, ot course, and
when he came to the plate we'd wave
trantically to the outlielders, shouting
to them to play back but the slugger,
then as now, struck out trequently. tt
was generally agreed by the "good
tield, no hit“ traternity, to which most ot
us belonged, that he hit the long ball
not because he was endowed with
special skill but because he was bigger
and heavier and usually olderthanthe
rest ot us.

The slugger had standing, ot course.
He was accorded a grudging respect
(Who knew when he would get a hold
ot one?) but it he was admired it was as
a treak is admired at the circus,, an
object to stare at, perhaps, or to wonder
about. One did not envy a treak, so it
did not occur to us to envy a slugger.

We won games because we played
heads-up baseball. Cratt and quite
were the virtues we cultivated, not
brawn. That wasn't in the book yet. tn-
nocents that we were, we played tor
one run. We took pride in winning the
close ones. We lived tor the moment
when we could contound the oppost<
tion with the smart play. Strategy, pure
and preterabty intricate in design,
tascinated us, and surely it was an in-
tricate piece ot strategy, with a minor
but untortuante deviation, which won
tor us, one year, the championship ot
the Corny Wallace Memorial League. t
was reminded ol that bygone classic,
witnessed by a dozen or so lackluster
tans (younger brothers and sisters ot
the contending parties), by an event t
once saw at Shea Stadium. trailing by
a run in the ninth inning, with two out
and a man on tirst, Yogi berra called on
Jim beauchamp to pinch hit.

berra's strategy was simplicity itsett.
beauchampswung at the tirstballpitch-
ed, tolling it in a gracetul arc tar and
deep into the upper deck ol the lett-
tield bleachers. the game was over.

The Mets had won. tt was, to be sure, a
dramatic victory, but it did tack subtle—
ty. Seven years ago, in a situation not
unlike the one just described, the
Meadow Hoad Mets had done it
ditlerently.

We used a pinch hitter too, but we
didn't call on a slugger. bone
Campbell was our scheduled hitter.
bone was it years old. He was the ex-
tra man on the squad. Agile and mm-
ble, there wasn't anything on a
baseball diamond that bone couldn‘t
do. He was one ol the best inlietders we
had; once, in an emergency, when my
brother Kize had the measles, bone
caught two games tor us. He was death
on My balls. 1 don’t believe i ever saw
him drop one. but the machine, so
delicately designed, had a detect.
bone could not hit.

As 1 said, we were in the ninth in-
ning. the championship ot our division
(the Old Development—us—--vs. l'he
New Development—~them) was at
stake. A run behind the New 1) when
We came in tor our last at bats, we had
tied the score on a double and a tading
texas Leaguer behind second, but the

boy who had hit the blooper tried tor
two and was cut down. Then our
slugger, bill Hiker, struck out. lt was
two out now, and bone Campbell was
up.
We held a hurried conterence, and it
was decided (Dan UiLorenzo and l
were the brain trust) to pinch hit tor
bone, who had struck out on three
previous trips to the plate. 1 can still see
bone’s lace when he was told that he
was being taken out ot the game, but
more distinctly can t remember his
anguished screams when he learned
that the was to stand aside tor George
Kraut" l-lurlman. bone was a big boy,
too, and there was the little matter ot
getting the bat (the only bat) away trom
him. this was ﬁnally accomplished by

\

- .-.
havrng Cart and Anthony Locatelli and
Wart byan pile on bone, pin him to the
ground and rip the bat trom his strain~
ing lingers white Danny and 1 con-
terred With the Kraut.

the Kraut's instructions were simple
and to the point. We knew what we
wanted him to do. bvery possible con-
tingency was thought ot, not lorgetting
the threat that it he didn't do what we
told him to do, exactly and down to the
last detail he'd be sorry. the Kraut
knew that he would be , too, and he
kept nodding his head. "Sure, sure,
whatever you guys want."

the Kraut was '/ years old, and about
4 teet tall. His instructions were to step
to the plate, crouch tow, making
hirnselt as small as possrble, and keep
the bat on his shoulder. Under no con-
dition was he to swmg at the ball. it he
was called out on strikes, we would
take the blame.

We ligured it this way. the opposing
pitcher (the " Veteran" buddy Garvey)
knew that The Kraut could not hit the
side ot a barn, and would expect We
were hoping tor a base on balls. He'd
become overcaretut and wouldn’t be
able to put one across the plate.

ll worked. The Kraut walked, and
Danny Uilnrenzo went down to coach

 

at tirst base. Again we played it smart.
in a clear, loud taunting voice Danny
Kept yelling to The Kraut, “Remember
now, he's up in the air, go down on the
tirst pitch. You can steal it, kiddo."

i don't have to tell you that The
Veteran buddy Garvey, alert to the
developing threat, made a hurried
throw to the bag, that it was wild (we'd
toreseeri the possibility ot a bad throw,
ot course) and The Kraut scooted to se-
cond base.

Along thetirst baseline, the Mets en
masse, including the recently stricken
bone Campbell, were screaming in-
sults at The Veteran buddy Garvey,
while at the plate stood the next batter,
b.b.t)., that‘s battling bill Deegan, wav—
ing his bat menacingty and calling to

the Veteran buddy Garvey to put one
over (also part ot the overall strategy).

l was coaching at third. Now i got
into the act. "Come on, Kraut," 1 called
through cupped hands, the second he
lets go, steal." Garvey let go, the ball
was in the dirt in tront ot‘the plate, and
the Kraut, sliding unnecessarily but
with typical Meadow Hoad Met tinesse,
was sale.

the winning run was now on third.
there was one ball on the batter. battl-
ing bill Deegan was instructed to sw-
ing at the next ball pitched. He was to
sWing (to contuse the catcher) but he
was to miss. For on the pitch '1 he Kraut
would attempt to steal home.

Like bone Campbell betore him, and
like so many people in this world who
retuse to play the lesser rote even
though it serves the greater good,
b.b.t). was reluctant to go along with
the overall strategy. He tell he was en.
titled to a good healthy cut at the ball.
50 we had to reason with him. We were
not in any position to call out the
Locatelli brothers to jump him, pin him
to the ground and have someone
pinch hit tor him, someone amenable
to authority. We didn't' have the
someone, amenable or otherwise. in-
stead we tell back on the intellectual

approach, explaining that we were
operating according to a master plan,
that a victory was withing our grasp it
only he made this single and sellless
contribution, and anyhow, who did he
think he was? 't'y Cobb?

Now, i don‘t want to record in print
that battling bill doublecrossed us, or
that it wasn‘t his sincere interest to sw-
ing and miss as he had been in-
structed. but he didn’t miss. He caught
hold ot one, and there was the ball
winging its way into Mr. Platt's cherry
tree (an automatic home run accort
cling to previous agreement), and the
Kraut was over with the winning run.
Mr. l’tatt copped the ball.

Yelping with joy, we rushed to the
plate, expressing the moments ecstasy
by piling on the Kraut, pummeling
him and each other with such iri-
discriminate enthusiasm that Carl and
Anthony Locatetli squared oil in
earnest, and had to be separated by the
more peace-loving members ot the
team.

Meanwhile, battling bill Deegan had
circled the bases, but by the time he
had touched home plate there was
nobody there to greet him, to grasp his
hand, which was in my day, even as it
is now, the etiquette ot the situation. the
stead, with the Kraut precariously
perched on bill Hikers shoulders, we
tormed a procession and marched in
the general direction ot the street
where most ot us lived. "Hail, hail, the
gangs all here,‘ we sang.

bewildered by ourinditlerence, and
not yet having had the opportunity to
retlect on the enormity at his crime (he
was to swrng and miss, wasn't he?)
battling bill Deegan ran back andtorth
along the line ot Singing and dancing
boys, grabbing one, then another, try,
trig to attract attention to himselt, seek-
ing some Sign ot approval tor the
tremendous blow he had struck at the
plate. but we did not pay any attention
to battling bill.

tn tact, because we were sound
baseball men, it was agreed without a
dissenting voice that battling bill had
to be disciplined. Alter some debate he
was lined bUdi (which he never paid)
and was suspended tor the balance ot
the season.

it all came back to me at Shea
Stadium when Yogi called on
beauchamp topinch-hit. What a mo
ment it would have been tor Meadow

licad Met strategy. l wonder what Dan-
ny DiLorenzo andt would have dreamv
ed up had we been sitting on the New
York Mets bench? Would we have dug
deep into our bag ol tricks? Would we
have tigured that we could win by cori-
lounding the opposition, by doing the
unexpected? Would We have passed
UPbeauchampand,peering down the
bench, called on a pitcher with an
anemic batting average? And then
have him stand at the plate with in-
structions not to swrng, remembering
that it worked tor us with The Kraut the
day we spoonted panicto the Veteran
buddy Garvey and his New Develop-
ment All Stars, and that it might work
again'r’

l don't know. We could have
squared the Circle somehow. but We
wouldn‘t have told lim beauchamplo
knock one out oi the park. that would
have been too simple.

Faculty-Student Association "H

(FSA) Membership Board remun-

tatives are lashingout at- somc‘stu- _
dent members. calling their actions ‘

at last Octoberthird’s'board meeting
“coercive” and detrimental to future
student relations with the ad-‘
ministration and faculty.

At that board meetingthe absence
of ii faculty member upset the nor-
mal half and half balance between
students and non-students. This
gave the students potential control
of the Board. Taking advantage of
the situation. graduate and un-
dergraduate students united to push
through several by-lsw amendments
which established a student majority
on both the FSA Membership
Board and the FSA Board of Direc-
tors. The proposal accomplishing
this. which was initially defeated.
ﬁnally passed with 14 students
voting for it and 12 non-students
against it.

Graduate student and board
member Candi Mayer, who was one
of two students to vote against the
proposal the first time it came up.
pointed out that some of the by-law
changes will be in conflict with use!

A Lack Of Evidence Dismisses Studs}: t’s 

by Sue Emerson

The whole thing was “like u night-
mare," sold SUNYA student Steven
Strauss of his recent encounter with
campus security in which he was
charged with speeding and DWAl—-
driving while ability impaired.
Strauss‘ case was later dismissed by
Albany Traffic Court Judge John
Holt-Harris due to luck of evidence.

Strauss and his roommate. Ken
Ronin, were stopped on Perimeter
Road at l2:52 a.m. on Sunday. Oc-
tober 5, by Security Ofﬁcer Mary
Daley. “When she [Ofﬁcer Daley]
got out of the car. she said. ‘You were
speeding‘.“ Strauss explained. After
checking his license and registration.
Oi'ﬁccr Daley asked Strauss if he had
been drinking. “l had three beers is
exactly what I said." recalled
Strauss. He was asked to walk a

(SA) President Andy Baumsn and
SA Vice President Rick Mcckler

- (members of FSA board). Mayer

believed that there would be a “per-

’ sonal grudge" held against her and

anything SA controls that was “dear
to my heart." They were also un-
interested in any arguments I had
against the bill.“ she added.

Mayer explained that only a
member who had voted against the
measure the ﬁrst time could rein-
troduce it. accordingto the FSA by-
laws.

Bauman feels that Mayer voted
against the proposal the ﬁrst time
because she was confused about the
issues on the ﬂoor. “She noticed how
frigging pissed we [Bnumsn and
Mcckler] were." remarked Bauman.
“She saw the sheer disbelief. anger
we had for her action . . . She un-
derstood how important her vote
was."

Biiuman denied that he or
Mccklcr had attempted to coerce
any Board members. “We did not
coerce anyone." said Buuman. “We
were angry. but it was not an attempt

curb. and according to Strauss. “I
walked it perfectly.“ Daley then in-
formed him that he would havcto go
to the security ofﬁce to be ad-
ministered a breath test. according
to Strauss. If he ref uscd he was told
that he would automatically be
found guilty. “I decided to go back,"
said Strauss. “Why not, I'd only had
a few drinks."

Stro uss said that Daley then hand-
cuffed him ("Shc dugthem in tight,“
he commented), read him his rights,
and put him in the back ot'thc patrol
car. Daley was not available for
comment. but according to Security
Director John Henighan. “It's not
unusual [for an ofﬁcer to use hand-
cuffs] when someone is apparently
intoxicated." chighsn latcr com-
mented, “It really required quite a
large intake of alcohol to be

 

luv-n air-rm. recently crusted tor"drlvlnn while obttltylmpolud."

’ . _, in; Mayer rein- .
"Mum thin marrow. She claimed

anger." "
Mayer indicated that her eventual

support, for thcpropooal did not ,

reﬂect her better j udgrnent. “Withnll

the hostility.” she said..“l tort in-‘ '-

tcrest in FSA; l was worn down.”

Vice President for Management
and Planning John Hartley stated
that he was not aware of any board
members using pressure tactics. “I
was conducting the mceting." said
Hartley. “so some of the political
maneuvering might have escaped
me . . .that doesn‘t mean it didn‘t
happen."

Graduate student Spencer Adams
represented the other negative stu-
dent rcsponse when the proposal was
ﬁrst voted on. He later changed his
position because he felt it “was inthc
best interests of the graduate
students.“ Adams stated that he in-
itially voted against the proposal
because it was in violation of the
guidelines set up by the Chancellor‘s
ofﬁce and it cut graduate student
representation on the Board back to
three. The cutback stipulation was
later amended restoring the number
of graduate students on the Board to
t'our.

Meckler denied that any thrcuts
were made against graduate students
or any other board members. “We

arrested.“ _

Once at the security office, Strauss
reports that he was told he would
wait half an hour before taking the
test. chighan said they may have
had to wait for an ofﬁcer who was
qualified to administer the test.
While Strauss was waiting, Ronin
recalls that he was in another room
withan officer who"was showingmc
how it [the breath machine] works."
Ronin also remembers that while he
was in that room another ofﬁcer
entered and. according to Ronin
said, “I can't believe what a he [of-
ﬁccr Daley] is doing. She's already
writing out the arrest form." As to
why Daley would prepare an arrest
form before the test had been ad-
ministered. Henighan commented,
“She probably thought that he was
intoxicated. I'm not goingto second
guess the ofﬁcer." Strauss said that
this arrest form was later destroyed
in front of him.

Strauss was ﬁnally admitted to
take the test. According to
chighun. il‘thc machine rccordslhc
alcoholic content of your blood its
being between .05% to .09%. this is
“primnfacic cvldcnce that your abili-
ty is impaired and also indicates that
you may be intoxicated." If the
alcoholic content of the blood
registers as .l0%, says chighsn.
this is “primafucie evidence that
you're intoxicated. no mutter what."
Strauss was told that he registered
below the .10% level and was charg-
ed with DWAl—-driving while abili-
ty impaired. According to Strauss.
chighan later told him. “Listen
Steve. I checked with the results of
the ten, and you really measured
enough on the machine to bccharg-
ed with intoxication." chighon
Ilyl that "the individual is given
every benefit of the doubt." Accor.
ding to Henighun. being charged
with DWAI is equivalent to any

had nothing to threaten them with.”
he remarked. Meckler mentioned
that he and Bauman did assure the
graduate students that there would
be ,“strong representation for
graduate students" on the Board.
“I‘m not against the idea of
students having a large amount of
say in the FSA corporation." con-
tcndcd Mayer. “after all it is mostly
their money . . . I don‘t think it‘s
necessary or right to engage in that

other trafﬁc violation. It is not it
criminal offense as is DWI-driving
while intoxicated. And as for as the
validity of the breath test. Henighan
says. "This one I have faith in. lfthe
muchinc says he was driving while
ability impaired. there's no question
[in my mind] that he was."

Along with the DWAl charge.
Strauss was charged with speeding
and told to appear in Albany Traffic
Court. Judge John Holt-Harris told
Strauss that if he pleaded innocent.
he would have to have a trial; and
that he pleaded guilty. his license
would be revoked for two months.
Strauss remembers thejudge its say-
ing. “1 have to go by the books.
there‘s nothing i can do. It‘s out of
my hands." th upon closer ex-
amination. the judge discovered that
security had neglected to send him
the results of the breath test. Holi-
Harris had his secretary cull security
and according to Ronin, “While she
was cutting. he [the judge] was
writing on the back of the ticket.
C are dismissed due to lack of
evidence."

This was conﬁrmed by Traffic
Court Clerk Mnry qun Creed. She
said that the judge had indeed dis-
missed thc case before the univcrisly
got back to him with the results of
the breath test. Says Creed. "They
[security] failed to produce a reading
on the ' L " content [tL " i,
there was no proof that he was im-
paired. The judge had-to dismiss the
case." All for why the reading was
never sent to traffic court. Henighan
said, “Well. that's a good question.
I'll find out the snswcrto that for my
own ediﬁcstion."

Said Mary Jean Creed. “He seem-
ed like a nice young boy."

Said Hortighan."l know what his ‘

condition war."
Said Steve Strauss. “The whole
thing was ridiculous."

“Straight, gut anger”: a mum Andy Bouillon am; that
couclon changed the vote of FSA Board member and um.

kind of action when it's not going to
do any good.” Meyer was referring
to the conﬂict with the Chancellor's
guidelines.

The guidelines state that. “No
single constituency shall have more
than 50% of the Board [of Directors]
membership nor shall the student
constituency have less than one-
third the membership on the Board
[of Directors]."

Hartley indicated that the
guidelines will probably go before

"thé‘SU N Y Board of'Trustees'for‘ap-

proval towards the end of
November. Until that time they can
lich no direct effect on SUNYA‘s
FSA.

Sandy Volt. another graduate stu-
dent rcpreseniative on the Board.
stressed that the “guidelines apply
only to the Board of Directors." He
stated that the restructuring of by-
laws concerning the Membership
Board cannot be' "recalled" even if »
the SUNY Board of Trustees ap-
proves the guidelines.

According to Mayer. the
Membership Board elects delegates
to the Board of Directorssnd husthe
power to change the by-laws of the
corporation. The Directors deal with
the operation of FSA.

Mayer feels that the students on
the Board are “creating pressures”
that will negatively affect student-
faculty relationships.

Hartley also believes that the ac-
tion taken by the student faction of
the Board could “cause deterioration
in collegial relations between the
faculty. students. and administra-
tion." Hartley said that there was
“some dissppointmcnt onthc part of
administration that there was ten
discussion of the iuucs and it [the
meeting] was all politics."

“I think that argument is bullshitl“

block. but how many faculty
