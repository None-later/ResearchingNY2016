Rathskellar Pub A Great Success

by Elizabeth Freedmen

‘l'hc Rnthskcllct Pub. ll bar which
just opened on campus about twa
weeks ago, has generated a great dettl
of em husittsm. concern. and support
for its success and activities.

The bar. located
downstairs in the
campus ccntcr. oc-
cupics about half of
the Ruthskcllcr. The
decor is patterned after a regular bar.
with tables. chairs. and candlelight
on one side. and (I but cxtcndingthc
entire length of the area on the other
side. The atmosphere is friendly.
comfortable. and intimate.

So fur. the pub seems to have
brought favorable results. Mttny
drinks have been sold since its recent
opening. and it has uttrttctcd good
crowds. especially on the weekends.
It has definitely made a big
difl'crcncc in the social atmosphere
of the Rttthskcllcr; and this
difference lllls brought more pcoplc.
and probably more moncy.

The new. on-cttmpus bttr has
many clcttr advantages. One of the
biggest is its location. It‘s right in the
middle of campus activities. and it's
very close to the dorms. Bccttusc of
this. the problems of transportation
and drunk driving are immediately
climintttcd. Having the but where it
is offcrs the students un allcrnttlivc
to going off-campus. Another nd-
Vlllllllgc is price. The drinks are
much less cxpcnsch than they are in
other bars uround the city. And this
bur is more responsive to the
sludcnts' needs and desires.

Because the bar is still relatively
new. there are some disadvantages
that must eventually be worked out.
One is that the bar must share lhc
room with the rest of the
Rtttbskellcr. Because it is restricted
us a food nrctt during the day. the
Ruthskcllcr can only operate in the
evenings. The amount of space is
also limited bccttusc of the shared
room. Another disadvantage is that
the drinks must be made smaller
than drinks sold in other bars
because of the lower cost. And. on
account of the snack but being
located in the adjacent room. the bar
is easily accessible to anyone. This
makes enforcing the drinking age
Ittw difﬁcult.

Despite the disadvantages and
various problems thttt must be solv-
cd. tltc Rathskcllcr Pub seems to
have had good results. Rick
Mccklcr. Vice-President of SA.
described the situation its being
“cautiously optimistic.” He thinks
the outlook so for is positive. but at
l'cw improvements would mllkc the
but cvcn better. One suggestion that
he cmphttsizcd is to make the place
more like an off-campus but. Hc
feels that larger and better drinks
should be served. and charged more
for. instead of promoting smaller
drinks at lower priccs. He would like
to see it imittttc other bars. and
become somewhat competitive for
business.

The but is n success. ttccording lo

V In a lecture Wednesday night In;

the Campus Center ballroom.
prominent Conservative William F.
Buckley .lr. voiced his concern for
what he termed the decline of
traditional American values. His
speech. laden with irony. sarcasm.
pit hi ness. and extremely long words.
called for a moral regeneration.

’ Buckley expressed particular dis-
taste toward public ﬁgures who
allegedly twist the truth: “Freedom
of expression has brought almost ab-
solute freedom to those who
deceive." Among the deceitful
Buckley placed Ralph Nader.
“obsessed by the number of corn-
ﬂakes missing from a package of
cereal. while . . . undisturbed by the
amount of minerals missingfromthe
syllogisms of the liberal.“

Buckley vented his in: over in-

couraged with the way it has been
working out. Although im-
provements will have to be made. he
admits. the bar has had no big
problems. During the next few
months. the but will be working on
programs for entertainment. and
Mr. Zahm would like to set: a con-
ccnlrution on campus talent. This
would probably add to the overall
changing atmosphere of the
Rulltskcllcr. ‘
Rat Divided
The original intention forthc bar
was to divide it from the rest of the
Rttlhskcllcr by building at wall. and
makingtwo completely different sec-
tions: one part would bc the snack-
bllr. and the other would bctlte pub.
Student-Association President
Andy Bnunutn is ttgttinsl lhc idea of
building it wall to section off the
Rathskcllcr. He fuels the bar is
achieving what it was intended to;
crctttc it more intimate atmosphere
and community feeling on cttmpus.
‘ He said lltutthc bar was by no means
completed. and realized many ofth
tcmporztry problctnsthttt huvcuriscn
must be straightened out. The Presi-
dcnl fccls strongly about renovating
the entire Ruthskcllcr. Hcisin favor
of moving out the entire cafeteria
and expanding the space for the bar
in order to hold close to 500 people.
He stated that ll lot more htts to be
done to make it an even bigger
success. llnd decisions on exactly
what to do will be made soon. He
observed: “Ettrly indications show
that it‘s goingto be at success. At this
point. we should forget the wall. and
make the whole Ruthskcllcr a pub.
It‘s who! the students want. The dc-
mtmd is there—let‘s do it."

y‘? chiding
economiIt friend John Gllh'lilll.
Informed by ‘ Galbraith album I I‘
pln nned lecture at Moscow Universi-
ty. the conservative journalist had
replied. “what do you have left to
teach them?“ ' . ' ‘

Buckley termed unfair Galbraith”:
attacks on capitalistic greed. and
backed up his contention that self-
intcrest is only natural by quoting
eighteenth century economist Adam
Smith: “(I have learned) the Penn-
sylvania Quakers have freed their
slaves. We may deducethat they(thc
slaves) are few in number."

Censuree Businessmen

Still Buckley did censure
American businessmen who blindly
forsake principle in pursuit of profit.
He compared the proposed sale of
crimc~prcvention equipment to
Russia to “selling guillotines to
Robespierrc."

Buckley spoke on a very high
level, which often made it difficult to
follow his tru‘in of thought. This was
especially true when Buckley took
issue with the ‘libcral ucadcmician‘
idea of cultural rclativcncss. which
finds no society as better than
another, but important in itself.
Since Marxism is “doctrinally dead“

think we should freely speak our
minds—this can lead to chaos.“ He
stressed the need for strengthened
moral standards. which he said help
to shield people from the realization
of the “disharmony between
themselves and the universe.”

Buckley ended his speech with an
expressed desire to see Ronald
Reagan campaign in the Republican
presidential primaries. Buckleysubt-
ly put down President Ford. of
whom he said. “I do not mean to
suggest that Mr. Nixon. in a ﬁnal
