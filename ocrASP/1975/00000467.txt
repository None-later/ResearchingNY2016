Jam/ed by student tl.t'.\'tlt‘itllilttt

by Doug Horowitz

The controversy surrounding the
fate of Mohawk Tower has
developed into a complex issue. On
the one Itand Student Association
(SA) under the leadership of Andy
Bauman advocates that Mohawk
Tower be converted from a faculty
office facility to a student dormitory
to case what Batman has called “ . .
. the problem of overcrowding."
Administrators. on the other hand.
have expressed reluctance about in-
itiating such a change without
further investigation.

Among the students and faculty ‘

who would be affected by a conver-
sion of Mohawk there is a great
difference of opinion. 'I'hose op-
posing a change in Mohawk allude
to a variety of unpleasant conse-
quences that would arise should the
tower be converted. Those in favor
ofthe SA position pointtoa number
of advantagesthat would result from
the change. Following is a sampling
of that opinion and the many com-
plexities that surround the issue.
Jean Auclair. an economics
professor said of the possible tower
conversion. “I think it would be
logical. it was intended for that pur-
pose (as a dorm) . . . it's not design-
ed for office use.“ Auclair. alluding
to the potentially expensive cost of
conversion added he would have"no
objection at all if we can afford it."
But Auelair raised another question

that apparently ison themind of '.
most faculty members residing in

Mohawk, “Where are We 'going to
put the faculty?“ .r " ’ ‘

An instructor from the School of
Criminal Justice. Vincent O‘Leary.
expressed concerns similar .to
Auclair‘s. O‘Leary said 'he would
have “no objection“ about moving
front the tower if he could be assured
that the faculty would be up
propriately sit tuned for student lear-
ning and faculty interaction. '

A sociology professor who
preferred to remain anonymous
said. “I‘m not sure how tnuch
students would want to live here.“
When it rains. the professor describ-
ed. "Water pours through the ceil-
ing.“ Despite the undesirable con-
ditions he seemed hesitant about
leaving Mohawk. “The process of
moving is a difficult one . . . it's a
nuisance." Concluding he said. “the
big problem is where do we go?“ Un-
til that question is satisfactorily
answered. the sociology professor
said he is reluctant to take a par-
ticular stand and he added. “I im-
agine a lot of faculty feel the same
way."

Although some faculty may be un-
certain about their position on the
Mohawk Tower issue. others are
strong in their convictions to stay at
Mohawk.

“Personally I like the ofﬁce that l
have" commented Edmund Sher-

man. a faculty member from the ‘

School of . Social Welfare.~ “

"wouldn’t" be too happy about mov
ing“ said Sherman. adding. “I un- ‘

derstand that places on the podium
are like dungeons.“ Sherman feels
that his current ofﬁce is amenable to
student interaction and if he were to

move this interaction might be en- _'

dangercd.

Theodore Wright's objections ton
Mohawk conversion are much more
extensive. Wright. a political science
professor. says he is “much opposed
to this at the present time.“ Wright.
citing many reasons for his objection
to a tower conversion. believes that if
faculty are relocated off-campus
students will be unduly in-
convenienced when trying to“ reach
their teachers. In addition. Wright
expressed a concern about "the ex-
penditure oftime" faculty will spend
commuting.

Wright is also skeptical about the
possibility of being moved to
another office on-campus. Wright
said he “resents statements“ made by
Andy Bauman in a letter to the ASP
(September I9, 1975). Speciﬁcally.
Wright was referring to Bauman‘s
feeling that displaced faculty could
"be doubled up in the single offices
on the Academic Podium (doubling
faculty can‘t be that bad. after all.
students are tripledl." Wright com-
mented, “I just don‘t think he's
thought that through all the way."

The problem ot ovorerowdng: II Mohawk Tower I solution?

Wright (who says his medium sized
office is filled to the ceiling with
books) believes Buuman “has no
idea“ how much space a faculty
member needs.

Wright also expressed a concern
about the long term effects of con-
verting the tower into a dormitory.
The political science professor said
that although there might be a need
for dorm space now. there is“great
instability of what students want . .

. what arethcy goingto want four or
five years from now?"

Wright's concern for the long
range effects of converting the tower
is also on the minds ot‘some Indian
Quad students. Mark I'levin. a Cen-
tral Council Representative who
lives in Adirondack Hall. feels that
the movement to convert Mohawk
"is being pushed through before it‘s
researched.“ Plevin questions
