says Bill Lemily. owner-director of

the Albany Art Gallery. This state-

who is an artist. but Lemin and his
gallery are unusual.

The gallery. located on 'North

Central Avenues is celebrating its
twenty-fifth year. The twu story

4 Jazz is AliVe “lot the Boulevard

by Fred Waite

if you are new to the area or are
tired of the local clubs. 1 highly
recommend the Boulevard (located
on the corner of Robin St. and Cen-
tral Avc.. Albany). which 1‘ dis-
covered this past weekend. The club
is extremely unique and has features
sllch as unusual murals on the walls
and ceilings. leaded glass windows
and 'round tables with plenty of
room to sprawl otll and relax. Also.
and not of least-importance. wasthe
music that reverbcratcd within the
club.

This past Weekend was a real treat
featuring jan llutisl Jeremy Steig.
Mike Nock on electric piano. and
Ray Mantilla on percussion. The
group was received by a large
Albany audience. It was refreshing
to see that jaw is very much alive in
(NIT ill'L‘il.

The music performed bythc group
was of high caliber and was well
worth the nominal $2.00 admission
at the door even for the listener
whose musical interests don't in-
cludc ja/I. Jeremy performed on a

‘variety of instruments in the flute

famin displaying his highly dis-
ciplined. stylized technique.
Whether playing acoustic or
electric ~his taste was refreshingand
thoughtful. The back-up ol the other
two members ol’lhe group decidedly
spiced and accented Jeremy's play-
ing: from the waiting and well-
articulated fast tours to the
memorable. haunting. lrcc-Iloating.
rllhatos. All totalled. the night air
was enriched and rarelied by the ar—
tistic vibrations froth Jeremy and his
group.
