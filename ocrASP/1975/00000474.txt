' Oktoberfest.
Bedlam
and Brubacber

To the Editor
We bringthis to your attention as represen-
tatives of Brubacher Hall, the only entirely
graduate dormitory on campus. As residents
fol Brubacher we have consistently attempted
to maintain reasonablel security and
maintenance standards in our dormitoryi
however. the arbitrary ' booking of large par-
ties on our lower lounges htts rendered these
efforts useless-(by giving free access of the
building to hundreds of people whom we do
not know. have not invited, and do not want in
our dormitory. Regardless of scattcrcd'mis-
givings. we have served as hosts for number
of these parties and withstood the consequen-
tial noise and.dantaged facilities that seem to
bethe consistent result. Ourtolerancc has end-
ed as a result ofthe recent Oktoberfest. during
which the following occurred:
l) Attempted-rape
2) Three false ﬁre alarms, (with two oc-
curring in other dorms of the Quad)
3) A number of assaults
4) Several thefts
5) Extensive property damage
6) Unlawful entry of students‘ rooms
7) A clear violation of fire regulations.
The commonplace response to these acts of
irresponsibilityand destruction is likely to bea
shrug of the shoulders. and a complacent dis-
missal of t bese occurrences its “typical” of par-
ties. However. as the victims of vandalism,
theft. assault and attempted rape. we find it
difficult to share this philosophicdetachment.
Therefore. we will makeevery effort tosee that
our dormitory is no longer the site ofsomeone
clse‘s beer blasts. and to ensure that our staff
and residency have a voice in the events which
enliven or endanger our hall. To facilitate
these efforts we plan to meet with President
Fields. Dr. Welty. James Williams, Karleen
Karlson. and the Albany Student Press.

Borrowed Permit

To the Editor

In recent issues of the ASP. there has been
come confusion about the incident involving
the Workers Vanguard. Sincethe people tell-
ing that newspaper were allowed to use the
solicitation permit of the Albany Student
Coalition Against RacithSCAR). it has
been assumed that it was members of the
ASCAR 'who were sellingthe newspaper.
This impression is it mistake. Members of the
Sportith Youth League Were telling the

separate‘and conflicting political viewpointl
It was decided to allow supportersof'the
Workers Vanguard to use the 'ASCAR
solicitation permit. not because of any‘
political similaritybe'tween thetwo groups but

" because of theimportance of allgroups having

the right to express their ideas by exercising
freedom of the press.
The rules required asolicitation permit fora
group to sell newspapers on, campus.
ASCAR \feels all groups. whether recogniz-
ed student groups like themselVes . or off-

League. have the right to present their ideas
and press to people on the Albany campus.-

IFG Still
For Art's Sake

To the Editor:

Upon glancing through Tuesday‘s ASP
(Oct. 7). I was somewhat surprised to see an
article entitled ‘l FG Schedule is Changing to
Attract Larger Crowds‘ by CS. Santino. i
then remembered an informal interview I had
had more than five months ago with someone
named Charlie. but in the interim had
forgotten about it. Now. not only his name has
been distorted, but also much of what I had
said. ldon‘t particularly mind beingattributed
wtih saying things i never did. I guess that‘s
what happens when interview and article are
separated by long periods oftime, but through
careful insertions and omissions. lFG is being
unfairly criticized.

The author has made it sound as ifthe group
has abandoned its tradition of showing art
films. due to a lack ofspirit. and has bccomea
moneymaker. iFG is funded by Student
Association and is not a profit-making
organization. Any funds left in our budget at
the end ofthe year go back to SA. The group is
run by a small handful of dedicated people
who are not paid for their services.

l‘ll admit that on first look our schedule for
this term appears to have a disproportionate
number of American and/or “big name"
movies. as opposed to our scheduling habits in
the past. This has caused many people to
question our intentions: “What‘s wrong? ll-‘G
is actuallyshowinga ntovicthat I want to see!"
But in actuality. we have not redefined our
purpose on this campus. We are merely reaf-
firming the fact that not every film that is now,
or soon will be. classified as cinematic ex-
cellence has to be in German or Swedish or
Japanese. made before I950. and totally
obscure.

Our set on musicals was in the planning
stage for over a year. and with “An American
in Paris" and “A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum“ we showed what many
consider the best pure musical and the fun-
niest. respectively. But showing these movies
has not caused the commotion.

it is the series of “Dirty Harry". "Coogan‘s
Bluff" and “Charlie Varrick". which the
author inaccurately labeled a Clint Eastwood
festival. that has touched off the most discus-
sion. The purpose for showing these three.
which was explained at the interview. but not
in the aniclc. is that they were all directed by
Don Siegel. Mr. Siegel. although not well-
known. is one ofthe finest American directors
workingtoday. Two years ago IFG showed his
"Invasion of the Body Snatchers". one ofthe
top Sci-Fi movies ever made. Actually, the
present series was worked around “Charley
Vnrrick". a disappointment at the box office.
but invariably on every ten best list. it was un-
fonunatcly passed over by both Tower East
and Albany State Cinema.

When the author does finally get around to
mentioning the series on Czechoslovakian
films. “Loves of a Blondc". “Closely Watched
Trains". and "Krakatit". he seems to do so as
an afterthought, also giving the impression
that the group did same. This is not true and
we have even made plans to add a fourth
movie. "Ecstasy". to the set.

As a final thought. everyone should beglad
to know that if iFG makes a profit this year.
and we probably will. that it might very well go
into funding the printing of more surprise ar-
ticles in next year's ASP.

Permanent Censorship

To the Etltpr:

it was after reading the article "Vigil for a
Doomed Poet” in Thursday's Daily Newswe-
tober ninth). that I became aware of how im-
portant our right of freedom of both speech

States. truly is.

The place is South Korea. the victim. a poet
by the name of Kim Chi Ha. Kim, who is
thirty-four and has a wife. a child and tuber-
culosis. will either be allowed to die in jail of
TB or will be tried and “quickly executed."

It seems that Kim‘s poetry is intensely dis-
liked by his government . . . The Korean
government. “They waddleintheir obesity . .
. They command the National Defense with
golf citibs in their left hand while fondling the
breasts oftheir mistresses with their right." he
writes ofthe cabinet ministers and for it must
pay with his life!

Presently, Ms. Muriel Rukcyser. president
ofthe U.S. branch of l’. E.N.. ii group of poets.
writers and novelists. is trying desperately to
rescue Kim from his hell. She urges that
everyone write to President Ford. President
Park of South Korea and to Congress to help
free Kim.

A blue suit is worn by all prisoners in Scotti
Prison. Kim's present home and his latest
poem (smuggled out of the prison) is entitled
“Blue Suitz"

Vivid blue opening

Zenger Defense

To the Editor:

I would like to take this opportunity to res-
pond to Carol Ann Stephenson‘s letter in last
Friday's ASI’.

i am a resident of Zenger Hall and proud
and happy to live in what is in all probability
the closest and friendliest dormitory on this
campus. Ms. Stephenson made an erroneous
assumption that the men of Zenger Hall were
sexist. The rebate offer was meant merely as a
joke. an unusual party advertisement for a
Zenger party. a tradition which has become
familiaron Colonial Quad. Ms. Stephenson. if
you had come to the party withaslecping bag.
a set of pajamas. or for that matter. a suit of
15th century German medieval armor; you
would have been more than welcome to sleep
in the dormitory lounge and you would have
received your dollar rcbiitc in the morning.
You may refer to it its a “coup de theatre“. but
we appreciate women with intelligence. in-
tegrity and a good sense of humor willing to

  
 
 

and press. however limited in these United'

return it with interest.

V Mir.’Steph son,- you are an off campus resi-
’ dent. tell me, have you ever been to a Zenger

Party either last year or this year? How many

men have you met who live in Zenger Hall?
’ One. two. five. twenty? I think that until you
' have met the approximately fifty guys who

have made this dormitory one of the happiest

experiences of my life. you have no right to

stereotype just as we(as you pointed out) have
no right to cheapen women.
.Your point. on men having a lack ofdisere-
tion and treating women as sexual objects is
valid and extremely well taken. 0n the other
hand. how many conversations have you
listened to ameng women that include such
“immortal” lines as:

“I don‘t really like him but i go out with him
because I don‘t want to hurt him.“

' “I guess he‘s okay. hetakcs ineto nice places
and spends ti lot of money on me.“

“i don't want to go out with him on Satur-
day night. help tnc make tip some kind ofex-
cuse."

Ms. Stephenson. which is worse? Is it more
destructive to have your body used and to be
treated as a piece ofmcat orto betrciited as a
pawn in an exercise of gttmcsmttnship which
the female initiates and controls by using
guilc. implicit suggestion and worst of all. the
lure of sexual favors in return for female
supremacy in the relationship. I don‘t want to
have to answer the question that l have posed.
but i think in an era of strident. militant
women‘s liberation. many males are in danger
of being psychologically emasculitted.

Ms. Stephenson, these comments are as iti-
appropriate as yours. but I have chosen this
forum to demonstrate to you that there are
two sides toevery question. It is tructhat often
a man‘s “fine times“ are at the expense of a
woman and it is truly tinforttinatc. Nowl ask
you. search “your” soul and ask yourself
whether you have ever manipulated a man for
some specific objective and stripped him ofthe
essential dignity that he must have in order to
live.

In conclusion. I want to make you an offer.
As a resident of Zenger Hall I am formally in-
viting you to the next Zenger Hall Party on
Saturday evening. October 25. l975. I promise
you that I will not ask you to listen to my
stereo or to observe the ntoon from the top
floor of a low rise dormitory. I understand you
are a sociology major; we may find something
to talk about. sociology. male-female
relationships or Ming dynasty Chinese
pottery. Ms. Stephenson. lam calling you out.
let‘s see if you are that ardent about attemp—
ting to initiate the “one on one give and take“
relationship you talk about. I should also like
you to meet my friends and judge whether
your stereotype was accurate or not.

There has never been ii similar 14 inonlhs‘

$2.75 billion child nutrition law with lopsided
majorities (Senate 79-1]; llotisc 29748) and
most Republicans deserted the White House.

can doubt that he is sincere in his economy
drive and one admires his dogged ticss; fitrt her-
more nobody lovcs his opponent. Congress.
But the whole economic postulate on which he
operates goes back to lloover. The huge
deﬁcit that alarms him so much is primarily
due to the recession. lost revenue and swelling
unemployment insurance but he nevcr'secms
to grasp the fact or doesn't mention it. Hts

crusade doesn‘t seem to be catching on and
more and more his speeches sound like an un-
derdog candidate in the last month of a
presidential campaign that is actually I]
months away.

Last week Mr. l‘ord proposed a tax reduc-
tion that he called “1 he biggest single tttx ctil in
our history" if Congress would cut an
equivalent amount. SEX billiott. dollar for

SA Budget Priorities- .

Student Agsociation Controller Stu Klein has begun work witbtheex'eetiivebnnelt
Budget Committee this month. With an early sta‘rt. it is possible tint the 
when presented to Central Council late next semester will reﬂeettbeben  ‘_
allocation of each student's sixty-six dollars in student tax. At least the committee
be better equipped to deal with sensitive issues such as the problemlast yea ,
committee had with EOPSA (Educational Opportunity Program Student!
Association). ' . 

Some Considerations:

l. Sports: One quarter of the-budget presently goes to AAB (Athletic Advisory
Board) for intercollegiate sports. With'the immense pressures on every SA group. it is
unlikely that SA will be ttble to continue funding AAB at that rate. Sports simply do
not provide a quarter of the beneﬁts from student tax. Unless an alternate source of
funds is found, SA should trim AAB down to at least 20% of the total budget and
instruct the following years' Budget Committee to consider further gradual cuts.

2. Concerts and Speakers: Concert Board and Speakers Forum received cuts from
last year in their initial budget allocations. a move against most students' interests.
Though providing these groups with a bigger budget (presently they represem about
15% together) is an acceptable decision. a look at the philosophy of ticket prices is in
order. All should remain low, but if Concert Board could provide big name
entertainment at normalconcert prices while continuing its present low prices forsma'll
concerts, most students would probably consider that a worthwhile situation.

3. Cultural Groups: Last year‘s Budget Committee attempted to cut EOPSA's
budget from about $35,000 (about 5% of the total budget) to about $7,000. EOPSA
responded with a sit-in at the SA office and at Central Council. and won most of their
original budget request. EOPSA‘s budget is large. and money saved from reducing a
few thousand dollars should be made available to other cultural groups. EOPSA
programs specifically for black st udents. while other campus entertainment is geared
to the university in general. There are other functions of EOPSA, of course.

4. Salaries: While a moveto reduce stipends was popular last year. little was actually
affected. While we recognize our prejudice as the ASP is second only to SA in total
stipends received. an argument can be made that the experience gained from working
for student groups is a significant compensation but we believe that the immense time
and work devoted deserVe some money.

Academic groups are generally student groups and the small (1%) part of the budget
they consume makes them well worth the expense. NYPIRG has two years to prove
itself worth three percent (537.000) of the SA budget. as their contract with SA
stipulates. Whether living areas should be funded is a question by itself. with
complications added by State Quad‘s Tower East.

Budget Committee has a hard job in front of it. We hope they‘invite extensive
feedback and that students give it; the half million SA divides each'year belongs to all
the students. ‘
