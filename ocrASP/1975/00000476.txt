:WSUA' Sports “Director Doug'

Lew ‘ do said his department is “the
tiglhes't” oil-WSUA. V ' _

_ “The sports department really
provides 'a, service to the students,"
said Lewanda. “Although our
budget doesn't allow us to cover all
the sports. we do broadcast live all
home and away basketball and f oot-
ball games while the school is in ses-
sion.”

Lewanda said Great Danes sports
rank second on his priority list. "A
large number of students on campus
are from the New York metropolitan
area and follow one or all of the nine
major professional teams," Lewanda
explained. Unlike TV 6sports which
he considers a good example of
“misplaced priorities, WSUA con-
centrates on those events of primary
interest to the student community.
not the results of the Niskayuna-
Shaker Heights J. V. football game."

He went on to cite several ex-
amples of the special events format
he helped establish. Two weeks ago.
the Ali-Frazier fight pre-empted the
regular music program as WSUA
competed with WABY for the stu-
dent audience. Lewanda was "very
pleased with the way it went off."

“Last year when Brockport played
Buffalo State and we hiid a shot at
the SU NYAC basketball title. we put
the game over the air, “Lewanda
continued. “Albany faced a game
recently with Cortland so we covered
it. There is no such thing as a major
or minor sport with me."

Lewanda also said the switch to
FM and the resulting increase in
flexibility will allow WSUA to
“compete with any professional
radio station around."

itarringinjury. they will probably be
too strong for anyone to beat this
year.

Southern Connecticut represents
a good college football program.
What State must show is that they
are more than capable of playing on
this level of competition.

Ford feels after scouting Southern
Connecticut. that the Danes are
capable of shooting down the Owls if
Albany plays up to its potential.

“11' we win we have a head of steam
building for the home stretch. and I
think We are capable at that point of
beating the remaining four teams on
our schedule."

campus has to offer. The open-k

“People shouldn't be afraid to

Lewanda. “That's ; how i and
everyone‘else here got on the air."

In an attempt toremain ahead of
their competition. innovations are
constantly experimented with. John
Fallon, former Great Danes football
player. has taken a wireless
microphone down on the field and
acts as a roving reporter during
breaks in the actions adding a new
dimension to the regular play-by-

way involves “patching” students
over the air to give the final scoreand
analysis of the Monday night foot-
ball game.

The “most successful" new enter-
prise. according to Lewanda. has
been the “Commentary” segment, a
two or three minute spot following

a , person the opportunity to speak

probably during the Sunday mid-

“Ct-ll MI ‘ .  _

“if there .was ever a pivotal game
in a season this is it.”

Albany Great :Danes football
coach. Bob Ford, is.talking about
Saturday‘s contestat New Haven,
where the Great Danes will meet the
Owls of Southern connecticut.

Southern Connecticut and
Albany boast 3-1 records. The Owls
own victories over Montclair State.

Western »Connecticut. and.

Springfield. college. Their only
defeat was in their season opener. an
upset by Wesleyan College.

“They are an excellent football
team." said Ford. “The more we look

_ at the films. the more impressed we

are."

The Owls operate out of the “1"
formation and feature a sprint out
and sprint draw type offense.

Calling signals for Southern Con-
necticut is quarterback Ed Swicklas,
an excellent drop back passer and a
very good runner.

“Swicklas is a big, strong kid with
an excellent arm, who can throw the
ball either from the pocket or on the
run." said Ford.

Another weapon at his disposal is
that he is always a threat to hold the
ball and run it himself. “And with his
4.6 speed, our defense will have their
hands full," said Ford.“Aithough he
is not quite as good as Boyes. wci'ecl
that our job on defense will be to
contain Swicklas."

 “ali'fi‘rrid Test A I H ‘

Swicklas‘ favorite receiver is

junior Hugh Dwyer. “Dwyer has, 

good speed and very good hands and
they like logo to him when they need
big yardage." Ford said.

The running will be handled by
senior fullback Joe Tamagmi and

- tailback Brian Small.

“Tamagni is a fine fullback who

I runs with good inside power and is

an exceptional blocker." Ford said.
“Small. also a power runner. has
good speed and can get to the out-
side. Like Tamagni, he is a good
blocker."

Both backs will be running behind
an offensive line that is both well
drilled and has good size, according
to Ford.

On defense. Southern Connec-
ticut will operate out of a 5-2
monster defense.

“They have an excellent size and
good strength." said Ford. “They
appear to have no glaring
weaknesses. They haven't given up
too many points (I 1.25 a game)."

The defense will be led by left
linebacker and captain. Steve
l)eFrancrt.

“DcFranco (5 foot 9 inch. 210
pounds) is tough and quick.“ said
Ford. “He is their best linebacker."

The line will be anchored by n 6
foot 2 inch, 250 pound defensive
lileIO named Aaron Soobitski.

“Soobitski is a big. tough. strong
kid but he tends to stand up too

tinucd.

dle and try to establish our inside

we can do that. it will make it easier
to throw and get to the outside."

“We've worked hard on our pass-
ing game ‘all week, and we hope it
becomes proficient.“

Cherubino and Colgate‘s Mason
shared the lead almost the whole
way. “At the three mile point I got
a little bit ahead of him and decided
to move out on him, said Cherubino.
“He tried to break me by going up

and blew by him."

Brian Davis was also named for
his second V strgight good perfor-
mance. Munsey, said Davis looks
ready to take up the slack in the
Albany line up.

Davis was very enthusiastic about
the way theteam was feeling now.

“I was working out both in the
morning and in the afternoon and I
wasn't recovering before the meets."
said Davis. as an explanation 0f
earlier Weak performances. “The
whole team had been kind of tired
earlier but now we've cut down on
our training mileage and are much
stronger in the meets."

Davis cited t he development ofthc
team's_ freshmen along with a very
team-oriented spirit among the guys
as keys to the team's late season
showingwhich may help tomake up
for the poor start the team had.

Burnett was also named runner of

performance." according to
Munsey. “He was kept up late last
night because of afircidrill‘l'laugbed
Munsey.

Munsey was very impressed by the

After the meet. Munsey emphasiz-

“It was a big win psychologically.
The team was feeling downright em-
barrassed over their performanceso
far and was very up for this meet."

“ Before the season. I felt that the
team should by ready for this meet
and we really were." Munsey con-
tinued. “we cut down on ourtraining
