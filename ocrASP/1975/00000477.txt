Netmen Take SUNYAC

by David levy

The Albany State Varsity Tennis
team captured 32 of a possible 36

points to successfully defend their
State University of New York
Athletic Conferencctitle Oct. 3 and 4
in Oswego.

By claiming four singles and two
doubles crowns, the top-seeded
Danes easily outdistanced runners-
up Bt'ocltport and Binghamton.
Oneonta placed fourth.

Patti Feldman once again led the
squad which Coach Merlin
Hathaway called “the best ever to hit
this school" by ending the season
without losing a set and copping the
number one singles comP'tition.

Dave Denny demolished the
number three field. losing only nine
games in the tournament to take his
title.

Rob Diskin, last year's second
singles champion, gained ﬁrst place
at fourth singles this fall while Josh
Council did the same at ﬁfth. Dis-

ldn’s performance was particularly
gutsy as he fought back to register a
come-from-behind M). 7-6. 7-5 vic-
tory in this finals match.

Fcldman teamed with Mitch
Sandler, a ﬁnalist at second singles.
as the first doubles team and gar-
nered honors; Denny and Diskin
proved a winning combination atse-
cond.

Albany Gets Respect

The respect with which Albany
was held was apparent in the
seedings before the tourney. A Great
Dane was seeded either ﬁrst or se-
cond in each of the nine categories.
The team justiﬁed the choices with
their six triumphs. '

Assistant Coach Dennis Moore
feels that the “tougher” schedule in
the spring will prove “just how good
we really are."

The Danes play a Yankee Con-
ference schedule which includes Ver-
mont. Massachussetts. Colgate and
Brooklyn.

Harriers 0a trun Colgate, 23-33

by Jon Lafayette

The Albany State Cross-Country
team scored a resounding win over
Colgate in a steady rain Saturday.
The ﬁnal score of 23~33 over a tough
team reflected how much the team
wanted this meet, accordingto varsi-
ty coach Bob Munsey.

The race started off fast as the
leaders in the first mile covered that
distance in a quick 4:49 with
Colgate‘s Bruce Mason leading
followed closely by Albany‘s Carlo
Cherubino, Chris Burns and Brian
Davis. The order was the same as
they passed the three mile point in
l4:47, Cherubino pulling even with
Mason. Burns and Davis trailing.

The runners then turned to loop
over the lake up towardsWashington

 

Ave. and disappeared behind the
trees. When they reappeared. Chris
Cherubino was all alone, nearly l00
yards ahead of Mason. They were
followed by Burns and Davis. two
Colgate runners. Albany‘s Keith
Benman. and Kevin Burnett, tied
with a Colgate man.

In the last half mile. Kevin Burnett
passed his man, and held on in a
sprint over the last hundred yardsto
finish behind Berman. The order of
finish-was: Cherubino first, Bruce
Mason of ColgatelsecondJollowed
by Burns and Davis. Bill Parker and
Steve Fisher ﬁnished ﬁfth and sixth
for Colgate.

Freshman Keith Benmttn and
Burnett closed out the Albany scor-
ing. finishing seven and eight.

Carsky ﬁnished next for Colgate
but Tom Ryan, who passed four men
in the last mile, ﬁnished ahead of
Colgate‘s last scorer. Opremcak.

Everyone connected with the team
said this was a real team effort.
Coach Bob Munsey felt that this
might have been a “get-it-together“
meet. and named three “runners of
the meet."

Cherubino. who got a win in his
second straight meet. now has lZand

of 25:15 was the l2th fastest time

State University College at Buf~
fan campus security is investigating
the apparent theft of nearly all 4000
copies of the October l7 edition of
the student newspaper. in what the
paper's editor termed, "a slap in the
face of a free press."

Pat Fergus. editor of The Record.
says that the papers were apparently
taken because of a “controversial
story" about a United Student
Government (USG) presidential
election invalidated last May. and
follows by two weeks an unauthoriz-
ed deletion ofa story concerningthat
same incident.

Reasons as to whythe papers were
taken from campus distribution
points after delivery are not deﬁnite.
but Richard Lippman. The Record’s
managing editor. reports that
Kenneth Boos. tl former USG vice
president, “has admitted the cen-
sorship of the September 30 front
page news story concerning the elec-
tion.“

"He will, in all likelihood, be
questioned about this current ap-
parent theft as well, by the Student
Conduct Committee.“

Boos' deletion, according to Lipp—
man. “was not discovered until the
night of October l5 when he began
to brag about it at his birthday party.

Stolen Before ,DistributiOn'

What he didn't realize was that the‘
reporter who wrote the September
30 story. Mary Allen. was at his par-
t 3. .

Allen allegedly rushed backto The
Record offices immediately. and dis-
covered that the deleted paragraph
concerned a show cause order in-
stituted by SUCB student Jack Par-
sons. The order challenged the right
of USO president Anne Tindall to
invalidate the May election because
of alleged "ballot stufﬁng.“

Parsons further accused Tindall
“of halting the election because she
knew she was losing" in her bid for a
second term as president.

Boos admitted that he saw the
negatives for that page left in
SUCB‘s yearbook ofﬁce. prior to
their being shipped to the printer. “I
had no choice." he has been reported
by The Record as saying. "I knew it
[the paragraph] was libelous. and I
knew I would be on the phone in-
stituting libel proceedings against
The Record if it was printed.“

Boos felt he had two alternatives.
“Either to destroy all The Records
when they came on campus," he
says. "or allow the story to appear
with that paragraph missing."

According to Lippman. Boos
chosethe later course. “He apparent-
ly memorized or took down the

says Lippman, “and somewhere

to take out the paragraph.“

“He kncwthe paragraph and read
it verbatim to the night manager

safeguards have since been insitutcd
so that “no one else will be able to
pull the same thing without
authorization."

SUNYA Student Detains Intruder

by Beverly Hearn

Dutch Tower resident Nick
Zubulake caught and forcefully
detained a burglar he discovered in
his room on October 8. University
Police were summoned and arrested
the man, later identiﬁed as Thomas
L. Green. Jr.. on charges of third
degree burglary.

it was discovcrcdthutthc six-foot. .

one-inch man was a non-student. He
entered the ninth floor room
through the suitc door. which had
bccn Icf't unlocked. Sixteen dollars
was tttkcn from Zubulukc‘s wallet.

“l \chn to the suite across from
mine at about It) [minutch to |:()0.
Wednesday afternoon.“ said
Zuhulnkc. “l lcft the suite door open.
At about 1:00 I went buck into my
stlilc tlntl \vcnt to my room and saw
sornconc going through my wallet
and talking moncy out and putting it
into his pocket,“

" the guy said he was ‘looking for
Matt he's not here I'd better go.“‘
Zuhulukc claims hc thcn replied.
“You're not going anywhere.“ llnd
shoved the intruder up against the
wall.

“i tried to take him to the suite
next door. 903." said Zubulake.
(irccn thcn broke loose so Zubulake
ttllcgcs he followed him to the
elevator. whcrc he wrestled him to
the floor.

“He reached into his pocket and
snid.'l-lerc. take this moncy~just let
me go.” claims Zubulake. “I took
him into 903.“

In the course of the struggle.
(irccn dropped what looked like
quite a bit of money in a money clip,
according to Zubulake. Zubulake
assumed incorrectly that the money
was not his.

"Someone culled Security," said
Zubulake. “and they came over and
hooked him." Green again told

Security that he had been “looking
for Matt." Zubulake claims.
Zubulake went to the police sta-
tion where his money was returned
to him. The l4 dollars in the money
clip belonged to him. Green offered
no explanation for the burglary.
According the Security Polics.
Green was nrraigncd on Friday mor-
ning, October l0. He was later tried

on rcduccd charges of criminal

trespassing. Green was found guilty
and sentenced to six months in the
Albany County .luil.

Accordingto University Police in-

 

vestigator. (Jury O'Connor. the un-
usual ztspect of the Dutch Quad
burglary was that Zubulake used
force to detain the suspect until the
police arrived.

At this time. according to O‘Con-
nor. there is no rcasonto believclhat
there is a connection between this
burglary and the Campus Center
“coffcc caper" of 'l‘ucsdtty.
Scptcmbcr 9. 1975. O‘Connor asserts
that Green's complexion and other
facial characteristics diffcrtoo grcut-
ly from the police composite sketch
of the suspect in that case.

Student Nick zubulalrool Iluyveesnt Tower reoovetedlhe money
stolen from him after wrestling with anlntruderheloundln hls room.

The reasoning behind 3005‘ ac-
tions says Lippman. is uncertain at
this time. as is 8005‘ connection with
the theft of Friday‘s editions. Elec-
tions for USG president are being
held between October 28 and 3|. but
Tindall did not enter the new race.

Boos Drops 0ut

Boos howaver dropped out ofthc
race for a student senate position
sometime between the September 30
and October 17 editions. says Lipp-
man. 3005‘ rclationshipto Tindall is
also not well known. although
reporter Allen says that Tindall not
only was at Boo‘s birthday party. but
that “she even baked the cake."

Lippman also considers 8005‘
claims of libel on the part of The
Record as rather faulty in the first
place. “ Both sentences in the article,“
says Lippman. “which Mr. Boos
finds objectionable. arc directly at-
tributed to the show cause order. not
to any opinion The Record might
have."

The student body. feels Lippman.
does not yet fully understand why

there were no papers on Friday.
since they will not be getting a paper
until today (October 2|). At this
time. he says. “rumors are flying
around."

Editor Fergus has criticized the
student government for denying the
paper added funds to reprint the mis-
sing cditions. Lippman further feels
that the :treasurcr of the Meida
Board. .an apparent supporter of
Tindall. should not have been allow-
ed the final say on that funding deci-
sion. . ""‘““"“

“‘Upon further” investigation of

this." says Lippman. “the treasurer

of USO today[Monday]agreed with
The Recon/1r position that the funds
should have been granted to us im-
mediately. Unfortunately. his deci-
sion came a little late."

The outgrowth ofthc whole affair
appears to be an aura of confusion
and bitterness. “We realize now."
says Lippman. “that there is no free
press at Buffalo State College if the
student government can hold up
funds for publication at will."

Court Upholds Paddle

WASHINGTON (AP) The
Suprcmc Court rulcd Monday that
public school teachers may spunk
pupils. cvcn if their parents object.
but must orduutrily try some othcr
means of punishment first.

It also agreed to hear arguments
on the power of citics to restrict the
location of pornographic theaters
and book stores.

The court then recessed until Nov,
3.

in thc corporal punishment case.
the court affirmed without comment

a decision of u three-judge federal
l I l'

in advance when certain behavior
might bring about a spanking.
Subject to the some exception. the
court said spunking‘xhonld never be
employed as a first line of punish-
ment" but the teacher should try
some other means of discipline first-
such as kccping the pupil after
school or assigning extra work.
The lower court also rcquircdthut

scnt when thc child is spanked and
that the parents be given a written

punishment if they request it.

 

court in North Carolina , u
the spanking of a sixth-grade pupi
in n Gibsonyille. N. C.. school.

The lowcr court held that the
spanking was not constitutionally
prohibited “cruel and unusual
punishment."

The child. Russell Curl Baker. was
disciplined for throwing a kickball
outside of designated playtime. His
mother had asked that he not be
spanked because she was opposedto
corporal punishment and because he
was a frail child.

The three-judge court said that
"except for those acts of misconduct
which are so antisocial or disruptive
in nature as to shock the con-
science.“ a student must be warned
