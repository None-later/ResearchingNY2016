~ Senator .lames Eastland

At first glance. it would seem like
tlte cottntry is not l'ar front reaching a
national policy of decriminalizing
marijuana. _

llut it may take longer tltan ex-
pccted.

l‘here are several obstacles to
federal legislation to decriminalize
marijuana. altltough six states have
already passed such legislation on
their own. and a presidential task
force recently recommended that en—
forcement of pot laws be given low
priority.

One of the major obstacles. said
Keith Stroup. cltairtttatt ot the
National ()rgani/ation to Reform
Marijuana Laws INORML) is
Senator James liastland (D-MS).
E'tstland is a staunch opponent of
marijuana dccriminalinition and
chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. through which any mariv
juana bill must pass het'orcit reaches
the Senate floor. In addition.
Eastland is chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on Internal Security.
which issued a report last year spell-
ing out the details of a marijuana
"epidemic."

There are good reasons to oppose
the decriminalization of marijuana.
according to Dave Martin. chief
analyst for the Eastland subcom—
mittee and coordinator for the

hearings from which Eastland's
report stemmed. Marijuana. said
Martin. can make a person “anti-
motivational“ or "dysfunctional."

“If you have a drug.“ said Martin. .

“that causes people to drop out'of
school and society: if you have
something that enhances any psy-
chological weakness a person may
ltaveto begin with: ifyou have a drug
that makes a person amotivational.
then you must consider a person who
uses this drug as the bearer ofa con-
tagious germ. And society has a
vested interest in protecting itself
against it.“

Martin claimedthat neither he nor
E'tstland recommended putting
“youthful first offenders" behind
bars. bttt insisted that possession of
pot should remain a misdemeanor.
since a "criminal record and proba-
tiott provide a mighty powerful
deterrent.“ Marijuana
dccriminaliration generally implies
that no criminal records will be kept
on minor marijuana arrests.

Eastland's subcommittee has
scheduled a second set of tnarijuana
hearings for November in whichthe
latest scientific research will be ex-
amincd. Martin said. “I'm not totally
against decriminalizatign. I just
want to take a go-slow attitude.“

Several marijuana rct'orm hills are
in Congress now. ’l‘hcrc is a senate
bill which tnust pass through
Eastland‘s Judiciary Committee.
Stroup ot' NORML is pessimistic
about whetherthat bill can “before-
ed through" the committee. A bill in

the House is'caught in “the same,

kind ot' bottleneck.“ Stroup said.
The House bill must go through
the Subcommittee on Health and
Environment. The chairman ofthat
committee. ’aul Rogers (l)-Fl.). is
“sitting on the hill until after the ‘16

could not be reached for comment.

Another marijuana reform
measure is proposed to amend the
controversial Criminal Justice
Reform Act. which calls t'or a
massive overhaul ot'the US Criminal
Code. If that bill is passed without a
decriminalization amendment.
possession ol' pot could be punished
with a 30-dayjail sentence and or a
fine of up to $|0.t)(lt).

But that controversial bill is mov-
ing very slowly. Stroup docs ttot see
any hope of a federal dccrintinali/a-
tiott measure in the near future.

Although tnorc states are moving
toward marijuana
dccriminalilationrr~the District of
Columbia is on the verge of ap-
proving such a measure and
Minnesota is not far behind-
overall Federal marijuana reform is
currently bottled tip. “We feel a little

"We can amid the ntincs they

Sttedish private. "llut we can‘t map

lhe Americans will be stationed

their mincfields too. and scorpions
abound all over the Sinai. A'dcadlier
danger could be the Palestine

to shoot the Americans as “an
