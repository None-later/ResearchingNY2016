- In Ilthe April I2,

I972 issue amt: Near

 .. East Report. an ao-

' 1.’ count was givenof the

,1, ﬁndings of the Com:

mittee‘ of Concern headed by retired

US General Lucius D. Clay. The

paper reported that “The current

policy of oppression began as early

as 1950. ,when the government of

Syria. a signatory to the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights afﬁr-

nting the rights of ’emigraton. for-
bade theemigration of Jewrr.“ '

The paper then listed several other
restrictions. on Jews revealed in
testimony before Clay's committee.
' some are that Jewa are notyallowed
to travel more than 2% miles from
their homes without special permis-
sion. ’and there is a l0;lit) curfew.
They must carry special identity
cards marked “MUSAWI” (JEW).
No Jew may be employed through a
government service and professional
jobs are hard to come by. Jews in
Syria cannot have either driver‘s

- licettses or telephones. .

The articlealso reponed increased
incidents of imprisonment and tor-
ture of members of the Jewish com-
munity:“’A young woman testified
before the commission (the French
Commission of inquiry) as follows:
‘Of the three persons who lied and
were caught. one came out deal".
another reduced to idiocy .. . They
tried again to escape and this time
succeeded. but their families were
arrested . . . The other person was
tortured with red-hot skewers the
traces were all over his back. They
were thrown half dead into the
street."

There are several other incidents
oftorture against the Jews. The Near
Earl Report of April 3. I974
reported the apparent murder of

Clay‘s committee intervened. It _
'called on Syria to furnish' the ac-

cused'with a proper defense and a
fair and open trial. The committee
also voiced the need for Jews to be
allowed to emigrate, saying“This is a
fundamental question‘and should
not be confused with political issues
in the Middle East."

Several l'actors'have accounted for
the fact that many people believe
that Jews don't have it all that bad in
Syria. One major event contributing
to this was Mike Wallace‘s interview
with a Syrian Jew on a “60 Minutes"
program last year. This man
reﬂected dedication to Syria and
happiness with the life he led there.
His name has since been discovered
on a list containing names of promi-
nent Jewish store-owners whose
businesses the Syrian Army is for-
bidden to patronize.

Other accounts indicate that
events such as the Wallace interview
are staged. Livio Caputo visited
Syria in I974 and wrote. “Con-
ditions imposed before entering the
ghetto were clear: No qttcsliom. no
intervieWs." When discussing art
accepted interview (‘aputo wrote.
“The interview would have been

 

“Reports of: Syrian persecution OF Jews are yearly exajj awed"

 

 

more encouraging if the two Jews
had not clearly been intimidated by
the presence of a Government of-
ficer. who continuously kept them
under his control."

Testimony before the Committee
for Concern revealed that “When a
French mission was to visit a well-
known Jewish school. the govern-
ment appointed Moslem principal
made sure that the Jewish students
and teachers were particularly well-
dressed that day and that they said
nothing ‘contrary to the interests of
the state.‘ From time to time Jewish
groups are taken to the beach. dress-
ed in fashionable clothes and
photographed to indicate that they
are living well.“

In the walte of all the pay-

chologieal horror movies out these, ,

days, a psychiatric journal reports
that some movie goers are being
hospitalized for what is called
“cinematic neurosis." ,
“The Journal of Nervous and
Mental Diseases" says that at Ieitst
four persons in Cincinnati alone
were committed as a result of view-

ing “The Exorcist."

Cinematic neurosis is generally
characterized by insomnia. ex-
citability. hyperactivity, and
irritability. Doctor James Bozzuto
says that patients are commonly
treated by looking at pirrtions of the
disturbing or horrifying ﬁlms while
their problems are probed by an
analyst.

The Salesians of St. John

serve youth, Unlike other orders whose apostolate has changed
with varying conditions, the Saieslans always have been — and

task but one which we welcome.

The nation's capital, Washington

criminal penalties and jail sentences

punishable by simple lines.

 

   
  

The vote by the D.C. city council
