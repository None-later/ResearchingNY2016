:want to call to your attention a serious in-

accuracy in your article concerning the

William Buckley lecture. .

You quoted Buckley as saying that Ralph
Nader is “obsessed by the numberolcorn-
flakes missing from a package ol'cerettl while
. . . undisturbed by the amount of minerals
missing from the syllogisr'ns of the liberal.“

What Buckley actually said is that Nader is
“undisturbed by the utttltlstrihuml tllllltllt’.\' in
the syllogisms of the liberal.“

For the benefit of you lucky people who
never had to sit through an RCO course. an
“undistrihuted “middle” is a poorly reasoned
argument. such as “all sardines are fish. all

.tuttas are fish. therefore all sardines are

tunas."

By now everyone has read in the ASPthut
Bill Buckley mumbles delirioust about Ralph
Nader and minerals. and they probably think
the poor man has lost his mind. In reality. this
is not yet the case.

Insecure With
Security

To the Editor:

1 am writing this letter to make public an in-
cident that took place here on campus on
Wednesday. October I. I975. At l2245 am. on
this particular night. I was driving uptown on
Western Ave. in my Cutlass 442. Havingslow-
ed downto IS miles per hourtoturn right onto
the SUNYA campus. I made another right
turn onto Perimeter Road and proceeded
toward Indian Quad Parking Lot No.8. My
car eventually accelerated to the Perimeter
Road limit. 30 m.p.h. However. it took no
time at all for the car that wasjust descending
the hill from the gym at thetimc of myturn.to
catch up with me—~ so far that it could easily
have been considered tailgating This car
could not have been more than scvenfcet from
me. and because its bright headlights were on.

 

 

e

lset
a parkingspace'. 's‘l turned around anisland
of cars. I‘caught a sidelong glance of the car
that had been following the. Security. The
only good reason (and‘even thatwtts a feeble
onei i could think of for him to be traveling at
'30 m.p.h. so close to me Wasto check my park-
ing decal. without stopping me. Another
theory evolved, when the oflicer chose to
wedge his car up against the'rear of mint. as I
parked. '

It did not even occurto methat I might have
done anything wrong. and l thust believed I
was in for a round of .that old game
“Vulnerable Woman and Mad Rapist (Killer.
Abduclor. Mugger—«choose your own
villttinl." Sensing it was the best timctocscape
from a bad situation. I began to pull my car
forward and into another space in order to
leave the lot.

Pounding on my window. Demands for
registration. license. insurance card. My look
of disbelief and eounterdcmand for a good
cause. Speeding. says Mister Frantent (Pre-
mont. ‘l'remont‘il. Knowing that l was not
speeding. I refuse to open my car doorto him.
Furthermore. I was not at anytimethat night
in thetown of (iuilderland. from whence he ul-
timately chose to issuethe summons. This was
verified later in the day by a very obliging Of-
ficer Coleman.’ who told me Guilderland
begins on Western Ave. at about the point
where Western Ave. would be perpendicular
to the Campus Center‘s Northeast-Southwest
axis. Another Security ear pulls up. A
different cretinous face demands to know
what the problem is.

My statement: I am a woman driving alone
at night in a vacant parking lot. I am
vulnerable. and I refuse to open my door to
any strange man regardless ofwhat kind ofun-
iform he has on. No comment from thecretin.
I pass my cards out through aslip I‘ve madein
the window. I am told I was only goingtoget a
warning. but now I am to receive a sum-
monst‘l). I am told to calm down while said
summons is written. lam harrassed because of
the engine my car houses. unjustly accused of
speeding (50 in a 30 m.p.h. tone. and in the
wrong town. yet). and finally left shaking like
a leaf. weeping in the dark at one in the mor-
ning. wondering what the hell happened and
why.

What I object to. besides the obvious in-
congruence between my story and that of the
security officer. attd my powerlessnessin prov-
ing anything. is the ominous. threatening way
the whole affair was handled. I refuse to
believe that the cop did not intentionally
manipulate the setting. time of night. and lack
of flashing lights on his car. in order to scare

pus where the security

Repeal the

"State Low

To the Editor:

I would like to point out a common excep-
tion to two different portions of Gordon
Karp‘s“l'rwl’rogrztmming“ column in the 0c-
lober I0 ASP.

First. Gordon mentionsthe need for“cvent-
oriented“ groups to have independent sources
of capital. We are told that without this
capital. these groups become dependent on
SA allocations. This. then. causes such
organimtions as quads to lose their “ability to
program according to the wants and needs of
their residents."

Now. if this dependency is indeed a threat.
why does State Quad restrict the sale of their
Quad Cards to its own residents and com-
muters? (Call the number in the ad on page 8
of October ASI’ectt‘.) Surely my four dollars
would be worth as much in “independent
capital" as anyone else‘s.

Secondly. Gordon complains about Jay
Miller's limiting his right to invest in the
programming of his choice. Should not State
Quad be included in the accusation“!

Upon arriving at the scene one hour later
the maintanance man tried his master key and
proclaimed“lt‘s broke. you will have to wait

until tomorrow at 7:00 am. for the locksmith

to eome."l knew what this man was going to

’ say before he got here. My telepath'y of this is
- due to a previous experience. On August 26

the same situation ~occurred; unable to get into
my room for six hours because of faulty
tumblers. But this maintenance man showed
concern. “Is there any other place you can
sleep for the night?" “ Yes but my books are in
there and I have a test In eight o‘clock
tomorrow morning!”l guess he thought an
hour was plenty of time to study.

Considering the circumstances. this main-
tance man went back to the power plant to
contact his boss. Well. asit turned out his boss
wasn‘t at the power plant so he called his
house. The boss wasn‘t home. i asked this guy
to call the locksmith himself but he couldn’t
because it wasn‘t uprocedure.“

'I'he proceedure I later found out from Bob

. Meccariello. the locksmith who arrived at my

door at 9:55 p.m.. was for the first main-
tenance man to determine if the lock was ac-
tually broken. He then discloses the problem
to his boss at the power plant who calls the
locksmith in to remove the lock. Mr. Mec-
cariello told me the reason for the delays is
that heis still on sick leave forthrcc weeks with
a staph infection in his hand. and that he is the
only locksmith forthe entire SUN Y A campus.
Four years ago there was a foreman. a
locksmith. and two helpers for the campus.
Now the foreman has retired; the two helpers
have gone to It general hardware department
and Bob Meccariello is the only locksmith left.
In these times of economic “recession” it
may be necessary f‘or‘the state to cut back on
costs. But it seems so ridiculous. so pathetic to
have one locksmith for the maintanance of
thousands of locks whenyou‘re a maintanance
man who cannot go against "procedure"
because his boss is not on thejob and is not
available to be contacted.

Healing the Scar

 

 

'  by David Troege

Recently in a toast at a state banquet in his
honor at the White House. Emperor Hirohito
of Japan said. “I extend my gratitude to the
people of the United States for the friendly
hand of'good will and assistance their country
accorded as for our postwar reconstruction.
immediately following that most unfortunate
war. which I deeply deplore.“ Simple words.
but ones which will allow the scar of the past
generation between Japan and America to
finally heal.

Does this symbolic ending of the postwar
era mean that we forget those men who died
for their country back at that moment in
history. or those who were permanently
maimed or injured in battle? Tilt: answer
should be an unequivocal "no".

The scar. a metaphor used above was
deliberate. Just like a scar on one's body we
look at the scar that exists now between the
Occideol and the Orient and we can remember
those days when there was pain betwoen our
two peoples. liut once the scttr heals. US it now
has. we should be able to move ahead once
again and live normal lives. We should recall
and learn from our experience of'tltat war. but
we should not regress. as we have already for
too long a period.

I975 seems to mark the first yeartltat we are
willing to march lltrougltthe gntcwaydividing
the past and future; we seem to be willing at
last to I am our heads front the I940's and look
ahead to the last quarter tti'this century and
the problems that lie ahead of us.

Itt politics. nothing is void of significance
and the fact that Prime Minister Miki was in
Washington on August (tilt is of the greatest
significance. It symbolizes some willingness to
forget and look forward since August 6th was
life .lllt It ttttniu-rsnt'y oftlte atomic bombing of
Hiroshima. Dining his visit no mention was
made' regarding that tragic human event.

Rather. attention was given to theissucs weto—
day share in common.

President Ford committed the United
States to defend Japan against nuclear orcon-
ventional military attack. and Prime Minister
Mlki committed Japan to cooperate in a new
cconontic and political order.

Perhaps uppermost in the mind of the
Prime Minister was the issue of oil. since
Japan‘s oil import bill has gone up from $8
billion to $23 billion in a year. If oil prices
went up another l0‘i’. the economic recovery
of Japan would be in trouble. Somehow. this
trend of ltighcr prices had to be arrested andit
was obviously art International and not a
national problem. since tltc US and Europe
are also being squeezed.

'l'ltis hopefully marks a new trend for the
f'uttIrer—an actual concern with international
cooperation because of growing global in-
terdependcrtce. as opposed to previous in-
dividual national interests which bordered on
the selfish.

Without being overly optimistic or
idealistic. this new interdependence might well
yield an era of peace which mankind has
always yearned for. The global community
may well now see the futility of a third world
war which was deemed nsincvitttbly succeding
the second global conflict of a generation ago.

We must realize that we live in a different
world today titan the one our parents and
grandparents constructed for themselves after
World War II. 'l‘ime moves along and in its
wake events are ttcver the saute; things never
go back to the way they wcrc._0ur generation
must plan for the 2lst century and can no
longer be concerned with what happened thir-
ty years ago. Perhaps we can do this at last
with a clear lteadoowthat Emperor lliroltito's
words of l ltaoks and apology have finally put
World War II behind us.

Sometimes you get the elevator‘and sometimes you get the shaf
immersed in university life it‘seemsthat the'odtls favor the latter. And why ott
out on SUNYA’P just because you're paranoid ‘doeiri‘t mean peopleare ‘ to
you. - - . '

We have an excess of. . . fucking Albanyrnonsoonsand wet slippery cement. zealous
univ:rsity police having field days in the parking lots. clogged drains. shitty coffee and v
wor .

Finally we lack an outlet for ASP related frustrations and we can't wait till Kit-k
because we have an excess of gripes. Oscar. our AP machine. screws up his ribbon.
administrators who give you the run-around. SA shitheads. mastheadvfugitivcs who
are always on the phone. compugraphics who eat their tapes for dinner. and those
fucking students who think the fucking ASP is put together by fucking elves the
fucking morning it fucking comes out.

Those are our frustrations. But listing frustrations. even ASP. only means that We
are sure of what they are. and does absolutely nothing for relieving them. Solving
problems requires action. Talking to people in charge of basses. writing letters to peo-
ple who form lines getting them to find more places to line up to so that lines are not as
long. finding your own communal bathing facilities. making your own coffee.

Works of nature we will never change (God willing). so we must work aroundthem.
Drink lots of orangejuice to prevent colds. buy a raincoat. beware of wet concrete on
the Podium. '

Inadequate administrative procedures were probably adequate solutions to
problems when they were devised. but have grown unwieldy with age. as the problem
grows and changes. To solve these problems. which we can rarely go around. legally
and ethically. we must bringthe inadequacy ofthc system to the attention of whatever
administrator runs the system. He may not be aware ofthc frustrations caused by the
long lines. the funny-tasting food. and not finding beer and champagne in the foun-
tatns.

As for human traits. well. you have them too. Make' sure intolerance ofthc faults of
others is not one of your own. Be aware that frustrations caused by the human-ness of
others are really your own fault. Seriously. . . be patient. Those age-old cliches for solv-

ing problems are age-old because they've been solving problems for ages.
