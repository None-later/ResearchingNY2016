Batters: Tough Season

wasn't a total loss.

"I wasn't awfully displeased with
our 4-3 record in the conference." he
said. refering to the State University
of Nchork Athletic Conference
games. “I knew i was thin in

pitching; [John] Dollard was our‘

only experienced starter."

And the hitting wasn‘t all that pd
tent. either. With the team batting
average hovering around .200 all
season. and the Danes stranding
runners as if they Were the enemy. it
was not a hitter's paradise.

Only senior first baseman Jeff
lireglio managed to crack the .300
mark. batting a nifty .345 on the
strength of a ten fortwenty-nine per-
formance. Centerlielder Paul Nelson

The main reason for the hitting
famine was the loss of the three. four.
and five men in the line-up. at the
start of the season. explained the
coach. “We just didn‘t replace
them."

There were no replacements in the
pitching department. either. With
the loss of Tom lilair (ineligibility)
and (ilenn Sowalskic (football
team). Burlingamc had to rely main-
ly on the right arm of Dollard to pull
the Danes through.

Dollard posted two of the team's
four victories—one a shutout—mud

college pitcher" in the coach‘s cs-
timlttion.

The other two Albany victories
were recorded by a hard-throwing
freshman named Paul DiLello.

season progressed. and Burlingame

the urgency of" the issue at hand.

Krupsuk stressed the need ofthe
ERA to give strength to women and

Lieutenant Governor. “I thought
we‘d had it when we got rid of
Agnew. but those same kinds ﬂof

Krupsnk explained that without the

reached. Said Krupsak. “Equality
under the law is not yet a reality . ..
The laws may be there. in some in-

The Yard Recruits Blacks

LONDON (AP) Scotland Yard.
worried about accusations of beings
“racist” force. launched s 550.000
advertising campaign Thursday to
attract more black policemen and
women.

At present. Scotland Yard has
only 40 black police officers amonga
total strength of 2|.302. The first of
these joined in I967 and none has yet'
risen above the rank of constable-
lowcst rank of the force.

The Yard. 5.000 policemen under
strength. took full page adver-
tisements in four of London's most
widely read newspapers touppcal for
more non-white recruits. Although it
mentioned Asians as well as blacks.
the ad was clearly aimed at the black
community which has been most
critical of alleged police racism.

Integrated

Under photographs of a black

policeman. a black police woman. a
white constable and a smiling Sir
Robert Mark. head ofthe Yard. the
advertisement asked. "Is racial prc'
judice keeping you out of the
metropolitan police?“

it went on; “Most Londoners have

never seen a black. oriental or
Asiatic police officer."l'he advertise-
ment admitted. “There's no doubt
there are prejudiced people in the
metropolitan policcjust as there are
in the population at large. But a
police officer isn't doing his duty if
he speaks or acts with prejudice...He
isn't going to last very long... Whena
police force consists exclusively of
people of one kind. and has to look
after communities where people of
another kind predominate. there is
bound to be a certain lack of un-
derstanding. At worst. the police
become totally alienated from the
community.

A moratorium on new construc-

declared for t he first time since 1962.

press yesterday that “There is slow
new construction being submitted

«ditions now financially and
Iotherwise required that there be a
:moratorium on plan. growth and
physical facilities through 198033.
asked that all projects now un-
derway be reviewed for priority
status before reappropriation is
alloted.

will have some effect on enrollment
growth for the University. The ac-
tual figures are unknown. for the
scope of the construction

NYPIRG Faults Grocers ‘

by Judy Jaeger

Patricia Koczko. a senior at
SUNYA and a member of
NYPIRG. testified before the Joint
Senate and Ass nbly Committee on

C6’hidiﬁéi“l"rbtb"ctién an motility; "

in referencctothe unit pricing survey
that she coordinated in Albany. The
hearings were held in Rochester in
consideration of a law requiring
supermarkets to individually price
all products. At present. such labelv
ing is for the benefit of the cashier;
however. with the future institution
of the Universal Product Code. a
computer checkout system. such
labels will no longer be necessary.
Shoppers will then have to rely on
the unit pricinglabcls onthc shelves.

NYPIRO‘s testimony was led by
NYPIRG director Donald Ross.
staff attorney Val Washington. and
Koczko. They reported on con-
sumer reactions to the unit pricing
system. the non-compliance of the
supermarkets. and the possible dis-
advantages ofthc Universal Product
Code. 'l'hey basedtheirtestimony on
the surveys that NYPIRG ran in
Albany. Binghnmton, Rochester.
Syracuse. Brooklyn. Queens and
Staten Island over the past three

weeks.
Unit Pricing Unused

“Our study proves that consumers
don't make use of unit pricing. and
the supermarket ind ustry is not com-
plying with the law“. Koczko
said in an interview after the
testimony. The law requiring unit
pricing was passed in New York City
in I972 and it went into effect on
.lanuary I, I975 statewide.

The Albany survey (the largest in
the upstate area) showed that of 330
shoppers interviewed. only one in
four understand and use unit pric-
ing. “The fact is t hat most consumers
rcly almost completely on prices ac-

tually marked on individual items“. ‘

Koczko said.

In Washington's testimony on
store compliance. she explained that
46% of the items surveyed did not
hut/c unit price labels that complied
with the law. “In theory. unit pricing
is a powerful consumer protection".
Washington toidthecomntittec.
"Its weakness is due primarily to the
willful violations of the law by super-

markets and the lack ofenforcemcnt
by the appropriate regulatory
bodies".

Ross
the supermarket

told the committee that
industry has

’ l‘orfeitcd its tight to institute the

compu'tcr checkout systetn‘because
it has "proved itself untrustworthy. .
. by its flagrant violation ofthe unit
pricing laws". .

The supermarket industry argues
that consumers will be checked out
faster. and the checkouts will be
more accurate. They also offer the
shopper a tape that describes the
item and its price. Consumer groups
argue that the difference in speed is
negligible as bagging is the actual
titnc consuming clement ol'vgroccry
checkout. and there is no guarantee
that stores won‘t simply have fewer
checkout counters running at one
time and havelongcrlines. They also
argue that there is no guarantee the
prices in the computer will be the
same as those on the unit pricing
labels. “A customer can hardly be
expected to remember shelf labels
for a cart full of'grocerics". Ross
explained to the commission.

Supermarkets also claimed that
they can save several thousand
dollars per year in labeling costs. but
consumer groups argue that there is
no guarantee that this saving will be
passed on to the consumer.

NYPIRG was only one of the
groups that testified before the com-
mittee. Several supermarket chains
were represented. as well as the New
York State Consumer Protection
lloard. labor unions. individual con-
routers. and other consumer groups.
Washington dcscribcd the
meeting as "large and high
powered". " We deli niter had anitn:
pact". she commented. and then
added. “the strength of the pro-
consumer testimony was that it was
based on many undeniable and
shocking facts. The supermarket in-
dustry had to use rhetoric to
strengthen their crise't

Kocrko pointed out the need
for consumer groups in such a case,
because individual I lack
the facilities or the knowledge to pre-
sent an effective testimony.
Washington stressed the role of

The master plan in I968 for stu-
dent enrollment in the State Univer-

sity system was originally 268.300. In
I972 the figure was modifiedto 205.
700. and will be again decreased for
I976. The enrollment ﬁgure on
SUNY campuses now is [63.000
students. -

“We have in effect frozen
enrollments on 20 of our state
operated campuses.“ said
Chancellor Boycr.“and I will be
revising downward the growth for
the so-called emerging campuses. so
we know that our I976 master plan
will fall sharply below what we had
estimated in I972." '

Chancellor Boyer expressed con-
cern about “maintaining I
guaranteed transfer” for community
college graduates. while maintaining
the freeze. Although enrollment has
been frozen on most of the SUNY
campuses. community colleges with
open admissions policies will not be
affected. Boyer stated his belief that
“The community college is a very ex-
citing and unique institution . . . it
should remain inexpensive and
open.“ "Many of our campuses are
becoming increasingly selective."
said Chancellor Boyer.“ . .. As our
enrollments have slowedand we‘ve
put a ceiling on our enrollments the
community colleges continue to in-
crease." Chancellor Boyer assured
the press that a plan was in effect to
see that transfers for community
college students are indeed
guaranteed.

Stable Enrollment

The State University intends to
maintain a stable enrollment
bet ween the New York Stateschools
and private institutions. SUNY now
enrolls about 20 per cent ofthe New
York State student population. "The
State University." said Chancellor

Boyer. “is committed to a policy of
.construction and enrollment plan-
ning which assumes that private sec-
tor enrollment ratios will be main-
tained." -

The enrollment freeze will affect
nine of the eleven arts and science
colleges. five of the agricultural and
technical schools. all of the specializ-
ed schools and the SUNY medical
centers. The four university centers
are still scheduled to grow.

The schools which will most
heavily feel the lack of new construc-
tion are ' University of Buffalo.
College at Old Westbury. College at r
Purchase and Stony Brook.

Rehabilitation of SUNYA‘s
downtown campus was to be
proposed to the budget committee
bill has now been scratched from the
list.
