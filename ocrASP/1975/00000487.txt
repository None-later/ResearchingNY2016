i 'to the group'of‘ twenty who came to
the meeting. Deane pointed out
some Opposition the group had
received on campus. He said several
posters advertising the meeting had
had ‘Fascist' written across them.

Several members of the organization

complained that most of the posters

had been torn down. '

“Libertarians seek a society

without coercion . . . without the

terror of the omnipotent state.“ said

Don~ Fedder. an attorney in the

Albany area. and head of the local

Free Libertarian Party. He staned

Off the speeches. claiming that the
government is “ . . . the greatest
threat to the individual.“ Liber-
tarians wanteveryone to have the

provided they do not infringe on the
rights ofothers. he explained. A
sign. 1 “State forbids smoking in
public places". which was on the
blackboard. served as a backdrop
for his speech.

Fedder also pointed out the inef-
ficiency ofthe state. even in activities
which it forbids anyone else to take
part in. such asthe postal service. He
referred to this inefficiency as “the
Midas touch in reverse". explaining.
“Whateverthe state touches turns to
shit."

Government interference in
people‘s lives was stressed by Albert
Weiner. of the theatre department.
"There is virtually no area of our
lives. public or private. which is not
controlled." said Weiner.

Deane came to the front next to
sum up the libertarian objectives.
“We‘ve seen our lives drifting away
from us." he said. “There‘s a point
you reach when you say 'No‘.“ That
is why libertarians finally entered
politics. he explained. But. he added,
"Don‘t associate us with politics. We
believe in individual liberty." To be a
libertarian, Deane continued. “You
simply have to be fed up with what‘s
gOIng on."

One member of the audience
seemed to feel libertariansim would
catch on. Continuing with Deane‘s
message of dissatisfaction with the
system. a young man said. " We have
one thing in our favor; things are get~
ting worse."

Schlafiy‘s group maintains that the
ERA will force housewives and
mothers out of their coml'orablc

According to (tray. many, of the
satnc people who opposed liberaliz-
ed abortion laws are now part of
campaigns to stop! passage of the

these opponents have argued that

because such legislation deals ex—

be denying the rights of the other.
lhcrcl'ore._thcse problems would not
be affected by ERA. She suggested
the fact that “This ( ERA orabortiort
reform) is just another point on the
side of women‘s rights and women's
autonomy" as a possible explanation
of the opposition.

Speaking to questions as to how
the ERA would effect divorce

also stated that in New York state.
neither parcttt has the unquestioned

right to.thc children but that this is
up to tltcjttdgcs to decide.

“the point of consideration is
what‘s in the best interest of the
child . . . . Laws are interpreted by
judges who have their biases." she
said referring to tltc tendency of
judges to grant custody to mothers
except iti cases of proven in-
competence. “People on the political

suggested. saying that while the

many fear judges will make a

However. she noted that the purpose
