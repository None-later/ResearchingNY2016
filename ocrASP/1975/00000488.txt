Among those on the list. accor~
ding to the Enquirer, are President
Gerald Ford; Vice President Nelson
R oeket‘eiler: Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger:' EB]. Director
Clarence Kelley and CIA Director
William Colby.

The list. according to the Federal

names of “essentials” or "non-
interruptibles“ who the government
believes must be saved at all costs.
The spouses of those on the list are
not included in any rescue plans.

it is interesting to note that not a
single member of Congress or of the
judicial branch is slated to be saved.
according to the Enquirur‘s list.
