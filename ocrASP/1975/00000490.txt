The Dilemmas . . .
Of the ‘ ‘ ' ’ "
Sculpture PlaidiasW

During his miiny years of
leadership Pericles was not without
opposition. Yet his integrity and the
quality of his leadership were such
that his opponents could not attack
him directly. Instead they sought to
embarrass him by attacking his
friends. His mistress Aspnsia was

‘ charged with impiety but acquitted.

His friend Anrixugoras—thc first
philosopher to take up residence in
Athcns——wrrs also charged with im-
picty and forced to leave ihc city.
l’hidiris did not escape either.

The enemies of Pcriclcs persuaded

Mcnon; one of Phidias‘ workers. to
accuse the master of stealingsomc of
the gold plate with which the statue
of Athena was being” adorned.
Pericles had. however. anticipated
trouble. At the beginning of the
work he had instructed Phidias to
mold the gold in such a manner that
it could be removed from the statue.
Amidst charges of speculation.
l’criclcs ordered the gold taken
down and weighed. The results
revealed thiit all of the metal was ric-
countcd for.

Having friilcd once, the dctrrictors
of l’cricles picked Phidias as ii target
at second time. charging him not with
cmbcnlcmcnt but with impiciy.
They chrirgcd that he had portrayed
himself and I’criclcs on the shield of

‘ ihc Athcnu I’iirthcnos. The shield

chryscicphiintinc technique which he
hiid rilrcridy employed with such
huge success in the Athena

rimount of gold. ivory. and other
miitcriul was collected. and the tem—

that the viewing of l’hidiris‘ work
was not only an aesthetic but it
profoundly religious cxpcricncc.

Thousands of pilgrims ﬂocked to
Olympia to see the lens. which was
generally held to be the most
beautiful and most sacred cil‘igy in
the whole world and countcd as one
of the seven wonders of the world.

In 40 A. I). the half-crazed Romun
cmpcror Caligula ordered the
iriinsfcr of the lens to Rome. For-
tunrilcly. the Roman govcrnor
charged with the execution of this
order stalled. pleading tcchnicril dif-
iicullics. rind Coligulri died in the
following year. For another three-
iind-ii-hrilf centuries the striluc stood
in its pliicc. In 39! AD. the emperor
'I'hcodosius I ordered on end to oil
