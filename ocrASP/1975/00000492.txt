 Poor Enterprise

 

   

by Lon Levln

I miss Star Trek-just as much as anyone else.
Memories of: Spock‘s ears. Scotty's accent.
Yoeman Rand's beehive hai r. Lt. Uhura‘s but-
tons and Kirk‘s stomach leave me yearningfor
another episode in the ﬁnal frontier. Of
course. I could do without the nostalgia
trinkets they are peddling these days. Per-
sonally. Enterprise blueprintsarea bit imprac-
tical considering I can’t drive a manual shift.

Hoping that my science ﬁction cravings
Would be satiated. I eagerly awaited the com-
ing of Space [999 all summer. labeled as the
most expensive show ever in TV history
($200,000 per episode). I expected a quality
show. Having Brian Johnson doing special
effects with the same sophistication he dis-
played‘in 200k A Space Oydessy and starring
Martin Landau and Barbara Bain, the series
just had to be a cure for my starsickness. In-
stead. after each episode my mind lingers in
thoughts of Captain Kirk and his mightycrew.

The plot of Space l999is a simple but clever
twist on the usual interstellar travel shows. As
the ﬁrst and best episode explained. in the year

waste on the moon. Somehow. a freak
magnetic lightening storm sets off a massive
thermonuclear explosion. sending the moon
and all of the 3H inhabitants of Moon Base
Alpha into space. Each subsequent show has
all the usual adventures of space travel. Im-
mortal humans. colliding planets and
mutants. The characteristic of Space l999that
is supposed to set it aside from other space
series is that the people of Moon Base Alpha
are totally unprepared for space travel. In
other words. they have a limited supply of
toilet paper and birth control pills.

But Space I999 lacks the idealistic
mysticism of Star Trek. Although both series
portray the strengths of women and men in
unknown environments. only Slar Trek, in-
stills a good feeling instead of the absolute
hopelessness of Space [999. The Enterprise in
itself is a symbol of awesome strength and
perserverence. Lunar Base Alpha looks like
the Pentagon on a meteor. The Enterprise
represents a cavalry-like presence in the un-
iverse. always coming to the rescue in times of
need. It is unsettling to be out alone in space.
However. I take comfort in knowing that if

I realize that being hurled intospaee can put

plots of Space I999are so serious that the peo—

show is a trauma and ajoke is as rare as a Big

the transporter is to the flow of each episode.
It saves so much visual time to just beam
someone to a planet instead oftravellingthcre
by spaceship as in Space I999. At least ifthc
ships were piloted by New York City cabbies
they would take short cuts and avoid tolls.

In a recent episode of Space I999 while
Moon Base Alpha was underattnck. Barbara
Bnin sternly said to Martin Landau. “We are
looking for answers. not heroes.“ Doesn‘t she
know that when I turn my dial I am looking
