[think of berets. the Eiffel Tower, Frere Jacque. lsee Maurice Chevalier
and Leslie Caron I am warmed by the beaches of the Riveria and cooled at

' right byfine chilled wine. I starve myself to squeeze into their latest fashions
yet spend hours trying to prepare the latest dish.

To the French will always mean gourmet whether a simple repeat of bread.
cheese and wine (somehow they make it sound better) or a spread beginning
with hors d'oeuvres and ending with chocolate mousse, the in between too
good to be mentioned. Somehow it's all so rich, delicious and romantic. (At

least in books and msgan'nes.)

Put two candles on the kitchen table, (how many of us have dining rooms?)
ﬂowers in a vase, put on the closest thing you have in the way of music with a
French twang. and serve a charming authentic though slightly Americanized
version of French onion soup and quiche lorrsine.

In order to be able to serve both dishes together the best bet is to prepare
the quiche tint and then put the onion soup in the oven for the last 20
minutes. One can always make the soup and serve while the quiche is
ﬁnishing. Quiche is also good cold for lunch the next day.

methods. I think the following .volatlle components of

8 oz. swiss cheese

salt & pepper

bacon, tomatos, mushroom (optional) '

Buy or prepare one pie crust. Mix cream. eggs, salt and pepper together.
Set aside. Cut swiss cheese into slices andlayit on the bottom of the crust.
Now is when you can add the optiomls. Either crumble cooked bacon, place
on cheese, or layer thinly sliced tomatos or fresh mushrooms (sautcd in
butter) onto the cheese. Pour cream mixture over and bake at 400° and bake
20 minutes more or until knife comes out clean. It is best served immediately.

French Orion Soup

butter

1 large onion .

2 packages of beef boullion

I small package mozarella cheese

grated pannesan cheese

2 pieces of thick bread (preferably French or Italian)

Serves two. .

Slice and saute onions in butter until light brown. Follow instructions on
broth package (remember 2 servings). Toast two pieces of bread. Place
onions on the bottom of one large ortwo small pyrex or coming ware dishes.
Add bread. and a hit of mozarella and parmesan cheese. Then add broth and
cover top with the remaining mozarella cheese sprinkled with the parmesan.
Bake at 350° until cheese is lightly brown. Usually about 20t02§minutes.

alight source through the wine.
Then look'down through the wine
,atawhitesurfaecauchassblank
piece of paper or a tablecloth
that .is well illuminated. tilting
the glass until the wine almost
runs out of it. (Looking through
the wine will reveal any cloudi-
ness or suspended matter; tilting
the glass so that the wine is shal-
lower permits you to evaluate
the color more accurately.)

What we are looking for is clar-
ity and pleasing color. Color
variations. particularly among red
wines. are considerable. If you
‘take care to notice them, you will
find that different wines are more
or less pleasing to look at. For
example. I find a bright magenta
rather annoying, and am pleased
by, say, a velvety garnet with
hints of terra cotta at the edge.
Your preference may, with equal
justification, be just the contrary
—the point being that there is an
aesthetic factor to pay attention
to, however you may_ react to it.

Some people also note how the
wine slides down the inside of
the glass after swirling. I find
that factor (caused by variations
in surface tension among wines)
of very limited interest. A wine
with a high glycerol or sugar con-
tent will tend to form “legs”
rather than "sheets," but that is
only a rough guide to something
your palate can tell you with
relative precision.
