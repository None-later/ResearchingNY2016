Korean Experience

To the Editor: .

Upon reading Ms. Rosen‘s articletOct. l7)
about freedom of speech in South Korea. or
lack of it. I too am thankful for our rights as-
U.S. citizens; granted in such as the First
Amendment.

I am also grateful that we Americans alive
now have ncyer had to experiencethecxtrcnic
tragedies of war in our own country. that We
have not been occupied and suppressed by
foreign powers. and that we have not been

‘ forced to rely on other countrys‘- goodwill

simply to‘ exist in even an uneasy peace.

Unfortunately these are or were conditions
present in Korea. which make for quite some
tension today. I am in no way justifying
various stringent measures taken by Press.
l’ark‘s regime. but I do hopctliat We foreigners
can consider the plight of the Korean people
and their land itself. From personal ex-
periencetherel know thatthey botharcl'ull of
beauty and warm hospitality which could be
devastated in the event of war. The South
Koreans are highly instilled with a sense of
national pride. and will strongly resist any
attempts to reunify their country under Com-
munist rulc. But I believe that they need sup—
port; not necessarily militarily. but in
economic aid so that the millions of poor peo-
ple can look to issues other than daily food
and shelter. And moral supponlrorn other
countries who treasure their freedom and
representative government could not help but
inspire them to continue their fight in preser—
ving these ends.

The welfare of South Korea may not be
closcto your hearts. minds. or backyards now.
but world events may cause us to focus our
attention on licrin the near future. Please let
us keep our hearts as warm as our heads have
traditionally been clear.

Rat Bar Rip-off

To the Editor:

Over the past two years here at SUNYA. I
am heginningto rcali/ethat l have beenliving
under the mistaken impression that FSA ex-
ists for the benefit of the strident population.
Once again l‘SA is pulling some shit on the
students. I refer to the outrageous prices on
mixed drinks sold at the new rathskcllar bar.

Let me ask you students this» —Is 75¢-$l,00
(depending on your choice of poison) for a
poorly made. one-shot (if that) tnixcd drink.
served in a thimblev-srzcd plastic cup an exam-
ple of catering to the students, who comprise
around 95% of the rathskcllars‘ business? Cer-
tainly not. Especially if you are a confirmed
and serious drinker like myself and my
cohorts, or for that matter. just a "social"
drinker.

Now. I have been hearing all kinds ol'crap _

. ,_ 1° _ r
But the one minor difference between Frank‘s
and the Rat: is that after 4 or 53 drinks at
Frank's “hid -it sometimes difficult to walk.
and if I do say.so.~l can hold my quuor'rather
Well. Comes from a lot of practice you‘know.

There are other bars that serve much better
drinks at the same prices as those In otir own
SUNY pub. Washington Tavern averages 80-
9th: for a decent drink. Sutters‘ mixes a potent
bigbball for a buck. Across the Street makes
an average drink (better than the Rat) for
around 85¢. On top ofthis. all these bars have

some sort of a happy hour during the week ‘

with reduced prices resulting in reduced men-
tttlities.

Furthermore. keep in mind that these bars
have been around for awhile. so obviously
they aren‘t going broke. What does that have
to do with the price of eggs? Well. you don't
have to be a computer brain to figure that one
out. They are making a profit (probably rather
substantial). And. (here comes the climax) if

dear old FSA keeps the prices on drinksjack- '

ed way up without improved quality. they are
going to be profiting also. I’rof‘its unjustly
made off of students who are their basic
reason for even existing.

So c'mon FSA. Norbert Zahm. and all you
big guys. have a little heart. will ya‘.’ What is
wrong with a shot and a hall’ortwoina drink'!
You know the old saying about “the more. the
merrier“ don‘t you? liasc up on those
bartenders too. Let them throw a free drink
once in a while to some ol the regulars ortlteir
mothers it they happen to be around. Let‘s
make it more like a bar. notjrtst another FSA

I don‘t want to be thought of as acornplete
cynic. “It: bar l.\' a dcliriitc impovement in the
atmosphere of the Rathskcllar. However.
further improvements are needed. Hopefully.
they will be forthcoming.

I would like to ctid with some words of ad-

our time. (iracc Slick. " liitlter' go away or go

Plain English

To the Editor:

In languages other than English. like
French. German. Russian. Latin. Greek. l’cr-
sittn . . . there are at least two genders. and
when stating a word it must be incithcrorie or
the other gender. So when talking ofa specific
profession as regards a woman. the word is
automaticallytand grammatically necessaril-
ly) declined into the femininc gender. and vice
versa.

Since English does not havcthis distinction.
a term likc“man" must necessarily be a generic
term and general iti nature i.e.. not denoting
the male sex. ’l'hercforc. "mailman" does not
mean a male mail carrier. but a human mail
carrier and applies equally to a female mail
carrier. The possible connotations ofthe word
do not legitimate an trlterution ofthclnngirage
at a time when the educational priority should
be teaching lingllsh to tltc millions of illiterate
linglish speakers. rather than alteringalready
long-accepted convention.

l‘herc are a lot ol'advanccsto he made in the
field of women‘s rights and social problems
and restraints. but I think that changing the
linglish language is counter-productive,
irresponsible. and a mtschunneling of energy

which could be used elsewhere.

Blocks On Campus

In the past few years. I have only heard criticism of blacks on campus. Many blacks are
indifferent towards whites. but whites sltouldn‘t criticize blacks because lhcyurc partly to blame.
Some whites have attitudes towards blacks that tend to riiakc some blacks develop low opinions
of whites.

Many whites up here feel that blacks have a bad general attitude towards whites. In st udctit
politics. whites feel blacks cause problems by wantingto runtbcir own programs l'liis campus is
largely white and doesn’t have ninch to offer blacks as far as st udcrtt activities are concerned. Can
you reasonably expect whites to look ottt for black interests in planning activities for students?
SA doesn’t look out for blacks and other minorities in planningthcir budget. 'l'hcytry to act like
they want to look out for everyone. but yotr can see that they care little about helping certain
groups. They would like to get rid of liOI’SA and control the activities of blacks and other
riiinoritics. Last year‘s episode shows us that SA was attempting to cut EOI’SA‘s budget
considerably. Taking into consideration the groups under EOI’SA. you can question their
motives. in spite of their explanations.

SA puts down EOI’SA for many things. one criticism is that they don't look out for all their
members. Well no group is perfect. especially that group with all the money. SA.

Blacks are accused of not wantingto get involved in campus politics and activities. I question
whether or not blacks are really welcome to participate in campus politics. With all students
voting in elections. blacks have little chance of gaining a representative faction of the black

blacks should be pttt iii positions of power in campus groups. Obviously. blacks can‘t dominate
activities geared for whites. but they should be represented in these activities.

should be as helpful as possible. and some thought should be given to' improving it on
this campus. ‘ L i ‘ Ll I .7 , '

Colleges traditionally place advisement in the bands of the student‘s major
department. and though the sheer size of modern universities complicates this. for
most students this is the best method. However. while some professors are very good
advisers. some are not. The principle of faculty advisement is quite solid. but it's
application could be better.

A short course in advisement may be useful to some professors. or at least some
formal discussion with trained counselors. so that they may be better prepared to deal
with the students they have under advisement. Since it may be diffiuclt to send or even
suggest that a faculty member work on his advising ability. maybe departinth
chairmen could simply bring a professional into a staff meeting.

'l‘raitiing of this sort for teaching faculty are not unknown here or elsewhere. and
obviottsly time and practice cati improve advisory ability. There are professors who
devote a large amount of their time advising both their own advisccs and other
students. Students can spend many hours a semester discussing not only career and
academic goals but the dircctiott of other parts ol'thcir life with them. Some students.
in real terms. do receive their advisement from a professor otliertlianthe oncto whom
they are assigned. It‘s a naturally flexible process - friends. family. faculty and others
often play a role.

Counselors in the University College are advising freshmen and sophomores. Some
lJC advisors are pursuing their profession. others are trained graduate students.

Undergrads often complain that their advisor is no help. just as they do about their
faculty advisors. While a system to match advisors with students in the best possible
way would be unwieldy. some adjustments can be made so st udents can switch advisors

with relative ease.
