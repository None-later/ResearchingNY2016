While the majority of us were
ﬁghting monsoon rains this past
weekend. Albany State‘s Women's
Tennis team managed to keep their
heads above water at the New York
State Championships held in Cor-

' tiand.

- Beginning herein Albany in i972.
'sponsored by Albany‘s women's tcn—
nis coach Peggy Mann. the States
were initiated to provide the various
state and private schools in New
York State a form ofeompetition on
a smaller scale than that of the
Eastern Collegiate Championships.

According to Coach Mann. the
singles and doubles enteries did
“very well.”

“We did very well. we came out
7th of 28 schools. where last year we
were 8th. so it looks like we're mov-
ing up!“

Albany‘s No.l singles player. .lanc
Maloy. won her ﬁrst match against
the Universilyof Rochester 6-160,
but lost her momentum in the 2nd
found. losingtothc St. Lawrence cn-

try.
Automatically entered into the
I consolation tournament. Maloy
made it to tho~third round. beating
"ivcrs from Herbert Lehman and

 

  Seventh]? *"

Cortland Colleges. Maloy was
stopped in her tracks by Mary Seldin
of Syracuse University. who later
went on to win the consolation tours
nament.

Donna Present. Albany's No.2
singles entry. replacing Helene
Kamisher. who was unable to at-
tend. lost in the ﬁrst round to Cor-
tland‘s No.2 player. After puttingon
a good show beating Cobelskill.
Welles. and William Smith Colleges
in the consolation rounds. Present
lost in her 4th round to Ithaca's No. I
player.

Along with the two singles entries.
Albany sent the two doubles teams
of Colleen Joyce and Terry Lenchan
and Captain Louise Coviti and
Mary llock.

Albany‘s “A” or ﬁrst doubles team
of Joyce and Lcnchan bcat Niugra
University. but then lost to Cor-
tland‘s “A” team in the second rou-
nd. In the consolation tournament.
the doubles tcam ousted llcrbcrt
Lehman. the Brooklyn “B” team.
and the ilrookiyn“A"tcum. losingin
the fourth round to i'otsdam‘s “A”
team.

The doubles team of Covitt and

round.

linding the season with seven wins
and two losses. Coach Mann is op-
timistic as to next year‘s team.

good nucleus for next year‘s learn.“
said Mann.

The three graduates will be:

Coviil. a four year veteran. usually
playing 3rd singles. Sandy Horn.
who moved up from .l.V. this year.
and varsity member Present.

“We'll have a good season next
year if they continue to play as well
as they have. said Coach Mann in
rclcrcncc lo the younger players.

llic remaining players consist of
freshmen i’aula Sunsvillc. Colleen
.loycc. .Iunc Maioy. and “done
