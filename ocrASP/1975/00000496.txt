“We played damned good con-

says you take your traveling show to
Ithaca in week two. ,

“They beat us lit-8.” Garcia said.
“It was simply a matter of breaks.
The ones they got and the ones we
didn't get. Our defense played super.
It was a real physical contest.”

Breaks or no breaks. a six-point
loss to the number one Division III
football team in the nation is no dis-
grace.

Week three Garcia brought his
team to West Point, home of the
Army. The same Division I Army
squad which plays Stanford. Penn
State and Nebraska.

“Our J.V.s are developing a
toughness through game experience

explained the coach.

“Sure. it's nice to win games. but
it‘s good for us not to get used to
blowing out weak teams and pad-
ding.point spreads. This way our
kids don't become complacent,
they’re always trying to improve.
and most importantly. when they
join the varsity they're hungry for
victory.”

The coach's formula worked last
week. when Albany won its first
game 'of the season. 7-6. over a
Middlebury team which beat the
Pups last year. 66-3.

“We're just starting to come
together." said Garcia. “It‘s very
hard for-the kids because we never
practice as a team. We simply make
out a list of who’s playing .I.V. on
Thursday. count heads on the bus
Friday. and play football with
whoever we have. We live with the
fact we make all our mistakes in
game situations. not in practice."

good field speed. And then there's

The Albany varsity football team
will host the Cadets of Norwich Un-
iver'slty Saturday.

The Cadets. under first year coach
Barry Mynter. are 1-4 coming into
the Albany contest.

“The record is sub-par for the
Norwich team,” Albany varsity f oot-
ball coach Bob Ford said. “They
have been riddled with injuries since
the start of the season.” (Starting
quarterback Walt Houghtaling has
been out since the season opener
with a broken ankle, and fullback
Joe Lusardi underwent surgery
recently. for a knee injury.)

“When Norwich is healthy." Ford
continued. “they can be a very com-
petitive tcam. Their gamctwo weeks
ago against Tufts proves their
capabilities.“ The Cadets outslugged
the Jumbos 13-9.

Norwich runs from n wishbone
formation and relies on running

by SUNYA Sports information

backs Sam Pizzimenti and Don
Brown for the workhorse duties.

“Both Pizzimenti and Brown have
very good size and speed.“ Ford said.
“which gives them an excellent inside
and outside running game.“

Quarterback Nick Bonvino is
credited with having a good passing
arm.

Defensiver the Cadets are noted
as an aggressive hard-nosed team.
The line is anchored by Vince Ar-
duini. a 6'2. 210 pound tackle and
Bob Moylen, 5‘9. 190 pounds. The
linebackers, John Eburn. Bob Sylva.
Mark Berthold. and Kevin Earl. are
very suitable for the 4-4 defense.
They plug well against the run.

Norwich was surprised by
Pluttsburgh 7—6, dropped their
opcner at home to AIC 31-24. and
were defeated 20-3 by Coast Guard
before picking up their 13-9 win over
fails. The Cadets will be coming
into Albany following a 6-0 defeat at
the hands of Boston State.
