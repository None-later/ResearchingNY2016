proved to be of a dual nature. as
Plattsburgh State came away with a
convincing 32-54 win over second

Albany coach Bob Munsey said
“the best team definitely won as
Plattsburgh. who would have taken
a dual meet 2I-34. put on an im-

Plattsburgh senior. Bruce Teague.

SASU Favors support"

NYC At Weekend Meeting

by Cynthia Haeinll

In a bid to prevent New York
City‘s default, SASU (Student
Association of the State University)
called for SUNY student lobbying
action directed toward Washington
legislators. This resolution came at a
membership meeting held at
SUNYA this weekend.

SASU President Bob Kirkpatrick
predicted a gloomy future for
SUNY. Hcrcfcrredto State Director
ofthe Division of the Budget Peter
C. Goldmark‘s recent statement. “If
New York City defaults New York
State will follow within 30 days."

“It is likely that the demand for
state resources will be so great as to
further reduce the bare funds
allocated for the University." said
Kirkpatrick. “This would mean
drastic program cuts. large scale
retrenchment of faculty and staff.
dramatic increases in all college fees
and very possibly the shutting down
of one or more state campuses."

Nine Courses Of Action

Kirkpatrick recommended nine
courses of action. some of which
would be performed with other
groups (i.e. National Student
Assembly. National Student Lobby.
the Union of University

Professionals). They were accepted
by the membership. .

The courses of action included the
utilization of SUNY trustees to de-
ma nd federal intervention. the
education of students and faculty
through the use of SUNY campua
media. a letter-writing campaign to
state and national legislators and a
one day moratorium on classes to in-
form the university community on
the issues involved.

Student Lobbying

Andy Hugos. SUC Purchase
delegate. suggested that students
lobby in Washington as part of the
campaign. “We‘ve got to let these
people know we‘re hurting.“

The tentative date set forthe lobby
is Tuesday. November l8. While
there has been some question as to
whether such a plan can be organiz-
ed by state campuses in such a short
time. Kirkpatrick spoke with op-
timism. “We‘re capable of making it
come off. but everybody has to do
their part.“ '

Hugos estimated that 300 people
would be needed to fill up the steps
of the Senate. He suggested that. for
optimum effectiveness. students (in
groups of IS) “should make it their
business to personally accost every

Groups Knock SA Double
Stub Ticket Arrangement

by Edward Moser

Representatives of both the
Freeze- Dried Coffee House and the
various school film groups have
complained about the new ’doublc-
stub‘ ticket procedure. under which
groups must hold on to a part ol'each
ticket they sell. count the stubs. and
keep a record of this for SA. This
new procedure is part of an overall
effort by SA Controller Stu Klein to
tighten the accounting methods of
SA-I'undcd groups.

"SA is continually passing down
mandates from above." said llob
Wong of International l‘ilm (iroup
(ll~(i). who was angry that SA
started the new system without first
consulting ll-(i. l'lc fears that SA is
getting too powerful.

“Ir. SA there are no checks and
balances . . . if I have a grievance.
there‘s no Ombudsman I can go to."
says Wong. “SA watches groups
closely. but who watches SA‘F‘

Wong admits that under the old
system someone stationed outside a
cinema might take a moviegoer‘s
money and wave him inside the
theater. and then pocket the cash.
Yet he thinks that previous losses
were minimal. since “if a person
stole. he would have been hurting his
own group."

Jeff Aronowitz of Albany State
Cinema calls the new system a
"useless pain. . .thc old way was at
efficient. We kept f'orthe last two or
three years exact records of the
number 01' people entering our
movies.“

Aronowitz feels that a dishonest
person may keep his ticket stub and
use it at a future date to get in free.

And he wonders about the ticket-

rolls which are stored in the SA of-
fice: "Someone can come right into
the office and rip them off."

     

Stu Klein is bewildered at the op-
position to the new plan. He agrees
that "it is hard to come up with a
fool-proof system“ but he feels that
now he gets "a hetterl'ix onthe cash"
taken in on the various campus
events.

A 'hettcr l'ix‘ Is necessary. Klein
explains. because "guidelines say we
must have an audit of least once a
year." and because sloppy records
helped prevent a full audit of SA
finances last year.

In regard to the attacks on SA‘s
alleged increase of' power. Klein

He feels that legislators in DC.
will be impressed because. “It‘s been
so long since students have been in
Washington." .

SASU. which is composed of
delegates from 25 state-operated
campuses. has been in existence for
five years. Its primary objective is to
provide a forum for campuses to air
and deal with problems which affect
individual campuses or the SUNY
system as a whole. This meeting was
highlighted by a party givenin honor
of SASU's five-year anniversary.

While the New York City budget
crisis was the major focus of" this
Weekend‘s meeting. otherissnes were
also discussed.

Several hours on Friday evening
were spent in deciding whether ten
newly-elected third world delegates
should be seated with f'ull votitig
power. The debate centered around
the question of whether or not this
would be in accordance with SASU
by-ItIWs.

A motion to seat the third world
rcprcscntathcs was propscd by New
I’altr delegate Alan Hahn and
Hugos. An amendment to this
motion was added by Fred Boy and
Paul I’erlinan. both from Oneonta.
stating that “these delegates shall
have lull membership rights until the

majority ofthe campuses ofthetbird
world caucus meet to elect regular

'dclegates.“ The motion and amend-

ment were both passed by a vote of
'the delegate assembly.

Angel Berrios. Albany‘s recently-
elected third world delegate. was
pleased that the seats had been es-
tablished. “We wouldn‘t be satisfied
if we were seated in the back.“ said
Berrios. “We wanted to be where it
counts. Even though we are mostly
representing the interests of third
world students. our goals are for the
overall student population as well."

Caucus Conference

A motion to organize a statewide
conference in order to form a
women's caucus was passed. Lisa
Chason. Binghamton delegate was
appointed to organize the con-
ference. which is to he held some
time bcl'orc December.

While Chason was pleased with
the idea of a conference. she
appeared to be disturbed that the
motion to establish ten seats for a
women‘s caucus at this membership
meeting had been defeated.

"SASU said it wanted women to
come in. but they haven‘t followed
through.“ said Chason. “I‘m afraid
it‘s [the women‘s caucus] going to
get caught upin structural problems.
'I llcy're already saying we brought it
up at Canton and Oneonta. lt"s los-

ing strength each time; it‘s being
worn down too thin." '

Chason qualified the need for
more women in SASU with various-
arguments. which ranged from. "the
need for additional people to be in-
volved in SASU now”to“the needto
incorporate more women in student
government." '

“Women have something to offer
to SASU." said Chason. “They‘re
used to being cut back and therefore
are experienced in dealing with and
avoiding it."

When asked about his ,overall
reaction to the meeting. Kirkpatrick
said. "This has been one ofthe most
satisfying and productive
membership meetings. It was the
first meetingsince I was elected to of~
lice and it gave me confidence I real-
ly needed. It made me reaffirm that
we‘re together."

Referring to SASU‘s new focus.
Dan l-lugos commented that. “Six
months ago. the delegate assembly
could not identify with issues that
affect students and the university.
the way It did today. I‘hey finally
rcali/cd the university is not an ivory
tower and that it is affected by
default. depression and economic
crisis. In the past we addressed
ourselves to narrow student issues.
Now we’re making links with all
segments of society."
