The roomful of students grew
quiet as a loud. huukyvoice of the
shaggy-haired man inthe from of the
room began. The speaker. clad in
blue ﬂannel shirt, jeans with red
suspenders, and a green cap covering
his graying hair, was readyto begin
his presentation.

Ifthc story wasto be written in the
style of the modem journalist. the

Would continue. This was the topic
of Seymour Krim, advocate of this
new style of writing in his lecture Inst
’I‘hursdny. cnlitlcd “Crisscrossing
the Fine Line BcIchn Journalism
and the Novel.“

Krim defined modernjournalism
as lhc conscious use of certain styles
ullribulcd mostly to fiction writers.
in non-ﬁction works. In modern
journalism. 11 reporter has four basic
outlets. not commonly used in hard
news stories.

First. Krim says. modern jour-
nalism sets a scene before it giveslhc
background of the event begin

citing one reporter‘s coverage of the
Ali-Frazier ﬁght in Manila. The
reporter described the ﬂight over.

unwound _, ,
before mentioning the ﬁght; The
idenwu to make the reader feel thlt
he was actually a part. and notjutt 1
reader. ‘

Krim stressed the major use of
dialogue to learn about pcopleln the
story. “They want the 2 little.

 

rtcchnicalitics of speech that give

away the character...lhe ums andthe
abs."

Also in an effort to reveal more
about the character. Krim suggested
the use of status trademarks. Rather
than simply dczcribing clothing.
references should be made to the
makers of clothing that a person is
wearing.

A most important aspect of
modern journalism is saturation
reporting. That is. the reporter
speaking from the character‘s point
of View; going inside his head and
describing his thoughts. A problem
does exist with this aspect. It must be
remembered this is still journalistic
writing. and what is presented must
be the truth. Krim says that it is
possible for a reporter to spend
enough! lime with a person to be
able to do this. and the solution lies
with trust in the writer. “This is one

pitfall of imaginative jour-
nalism...lhc writer has to be
honorable...“ takes perceptive

reading." Krim also stressed that in
order for this to be cff'ective..lhe
writer must feel a real compassion
for his topic. and not just be writing
another assignment.

I! is difficult to say exactly where
modern journalism ﬁts into our
society. Krim says that he doesn't
know if this type of writing will ever
be used for straight. new stories. “I
tried to do it when I worked for the
New York Post and I got ﬁred." It is
used more often in magazines and
feature stories. Publications like the
Rolling Stone prim material with
modern journalism fits into our
society. Krim says that he doesn't
know if this type ofwriling will ever
be used for straight news stories. “I
tried to do it when I worked for the
New York Post and I got ﬁred.“ It is
used more often in magazines and
feature stories. Publications like the

modem'journnlium quite often. Will ‘

lack the uploe to write a Iton in tbil
manner. although Krim sayc it bu
been done; He is in‘tavor of using
new journaliml as much as possible.
“It's trying to make lhejob morcin-
tercsting for the writer and the
reader.” _

This type of reporting has been
compared to a good l.v. documen-
tary. However, Krim commented
that the price is too high and the
stakes too great for television to ex-
periment in this way. Also. the
broadcast media is responsiblelo the
Federal Communications Commis-
sion for such regulations as equal
time. so it is very cautious and does
not take many chances with thing:
like modern journalism.

Krim sces modern journalism u
having positive psychological
effects. It is a breaking down of {ho
stereotypes given to ﬁction and non-
ﬁction Work. “I‘m glad to secthein-
l'criority complex of the journalim
disappcar...it is no longer true that
the journalist doesn‘t have an im-
agination because of what he is
writing.“ _

When asked if he would classify
himself as a modernjournalisl. Krim
said he didn‘t think so because he is
not longer involved with daily repor-
ting. He is known as a member ofthc
“heat generation" of the 1950‘s. A!
that time he wanted to be a novelist.
but realized thnl“lf you're gonna tell
it you might as well tell it like it is."
He fell into the mode of combining
fiction wriling with factual material.
He has written and edilcd for
newspapers and magazines.

At the end of his presentation.
Krim renqﬂowt Work that he is
presently writing called “Chaos.” It
is a book that touches on several
themes. in no particular order. It
does indeed report facts. but he‘s not
sure if it could be defined as modern
journalism. It is written in a con-
fused manner. with long sentences
and rhymes. But he says that all of
the sentences are legal and “there‘s

nothing wrong with entertaining as
long as you get your point across."
