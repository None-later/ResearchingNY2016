1  Don‘t bank On It .

To the Fallon

lt is tormenting to observe thisUniversity
does not have a banking facility on its campus.
We need to think about the possibility of in-
viting a commercial bank to open its branch
office on campus and provide various services.
including free check-cashing.

The only near-banking service available on
campus is the check-cashing service provided
by the Faculty-Student Association of this
school. Not only does the Iimitedness ol'their
services cause inconvenience (they do not
accept deposits). their operation is very costly.

For every check they cash. whose maximum
can not exceed $50. they uniformly charge 25
cents as a fee. This fee can only be avoided by
taking a trip to a nearby bank. which usually
means a waste of time for more than twenty
minutes.

This fee cannot be said to be excessive at all.
In fact. the users ot'thefacility are being “sub-
sidized“ with the money FSA makes from the
operation of dormitory cafeterias. To the ex-
tent necessary expenses for its operation
(salaries. losses resulting from bad checks.
etc.) are not fully recovered from the fees it
collects. the "subsidy" argument is valid. In

l974 and before that. it recorded net loss.

It is hard to anticipate a substantial reduc-
tion of costs will be realized as a result of an
improvement in their efficiency. Anyway. un-
der the present arrangement. their operation is
small.

A clear alternative is to have a branch office
ofa commercial bank in its place. How will it
work out?

It is because of the existence of certain
financial resources on campus which can
profitably be utilized and benefits he returned
to the students.

Simply speaking. once a bank opens its
branch on campus. a lot of people would flock
in to open an account and deposit their pay-
checks or stipends or whatever. The bank will
lend the money outside of campus where the
demand for it is strong. With the revenue it

But'odds are "on us. It is not hard to find.
many colleges and universities smaller than us
do have bank ofﬁces on their campuses.

Indeed. it is even plausible some bankers
will pay a fee to the university in exchange for
the privilege of keeping their ofﬁce on our
campus.

So let‘s give it trial. Let the bankers bid the
prices they are willing to pay (or charge) in
order to open a branch on our campus. There
is little. if any. we can lose by simplydoingso.

To the Editor:

I was wondering if you could possibly place
an ad for me in your student newspaper. You
see. I am serving the latter part of a seven year
sentence in a New York State Prison. Recently
I was transferred from another institution
where the ideology was based on the
psychological principles of learning theory
and positive behavior modification.

However. due to recent budget cuts in New
York State. I was transferred to an institution
where they still believe in the old Secure and
Punish ideology. In the first institution 1 was
in. l was treated humaner with plenty of
rehabilitative programs available. whereas
now I am locked in a cell twenty-two hours a
day.

Since coming to prison. I have lost the few
friends I corresponded with. As you may
realize. it is an extremely lonely existence.
While in the other institution. I had frequent
contacts with students from the outside un-
iversities. which was gratifying. We helped
each other gain a better understanding of the
people and places of the world in which we
live. Naturally. since coming to this more
stringent institution. I found my existence had
radically changed.

My main objective at this point isto obtain
new and meaningful relationships through
correspondence. I am hoping that there are
people who care and are concerned with
anothcr‘s psychological well being.

I am writingto you in hope that you may be
able to help me. I am presentlyincarceratedin
the Marion Correctional Institute in Ohio and
and in dire need of some correspondence.

l have no friends or family with whom to
communicate. which makes each day seem
endless. I am well versed in most subjects and
like to correspond with anyone regardless of"
age. race or sex.

It' at all possible. I would appreciate it if you
would run my letter in your school paper.

In any event. I‘d like to thank you for your
time and any help you may give me on this
matter.

To the 

On an obscure corner on pay three of
Friday's ASP(anber 24). the eletaion results
were printed. Diane Piche was elected to
SASU Student Assembly with l28 out of 298
votes. Ms. Piche is an intelligent and active
person and she will probably do a good job;
but 298 votes out of “.000 students? It does
not take a math major to figure out that 2. l%
student participation in’ an election is little
more than a joke.

I don't think that student apathy deserves
all of the blame. There should have been some
sort of publicity made other than the an‘
nouncement that “elections will be held
between x and y and the candidates are a. b.
and c Such media instruments as WSUA. the
ASP. the Town Tribune. and ED. Stone‘s

Pillars all can and should be used to inform
students of candidates‘ positions and
backgrounds. A “VOTE FOR ME“ sign is just
inadequate as a form of information for in-

II' t.tltinkin students.

Hey. I wanna tell ya. that Ken Wax is sucha
funny guy. Take that column he wrote last
Tuesday about NYC going communist. I I
haven't laughed so hard since I last read that
same article in Russell Baker‘s column a while
back. Hey. and I really dig that style (Hunter
tells me that in journalistic circles. it's known
as free-lance xerox). Can I suggest another
journalistic coup‘! 'l'cll Ken to go out to his
localncwsstandand purchase a National Lam-
poon and to read some pieces by Chris Miller
and PJ. O‘Rourke. Ken. I think you‘ll find
their style quite similar to yours. and maybe
provide you with some "new" ideas. Think
about it over some warmed-over coffee.

Warning: Coming Cuts

Money. In the nineteen sixties there was a great deal of it. or at least everybody
thought so. Havea social ill'.’ Throw on some money. Poor? Sick? Stupid? Bankrupt? A
few million-dollar programs and things are sure to improve.

But they haven‘t. And for higher education, they look worse than they have for a
long time. Not only do colleges face a fiscal squeeze. but also a decreasein enrollment.
Fewer students will be available over the next years as the baby boom children leavethe
educational system. And in this state. a New York City default will cause a state
default. and that can hurt SUNY.

While we do have cause to fear the spectre ofsevere cutbacks in the SU NY system. a
moment‘s reflection should be taken otitsidethcf‘amiliar perspective ol'student. faculty
member or administrator. If' our society were to place its priorities propcrly. there
would be more money for health. education and welfare of all kinds and less for such
nrctis as the military. A readjustment ot'this sort is. unfortunately.unrealistic Higher
education is competing with prison reform. food stamps. and free health clinics.
Compared with most of its competitors. and considering the drop in the student
population. it is it logical place to cut.

Not that SUNY cuts shouldn‘t be fought. The economy can he pushed upagain. anti
the situation improved. In New York. the legislature has started a trend supporting
private colleges more than. public ones »—tiid to private schools is virtually unchanged
this year wltilc the SUNY system suffered severe cuts. That trend. besides being unfair.
is a rejection of the state‘s commitment to low-cost education. Such a rejection
represents dcscrtioii of the ideal of our d--inocratic society: equal opporttinity.

Cuts in the SUNY system have been and will be made. especially if there is a state
dcl'tttilt. SUNY has already ptit a moratorium onconstruction;whilc this leaves some
schools in ii permanent state of transition. it is hard to argue that society needs more
collcgc spacc today. Prediction of further cuts include eliminating programs and some
colleges. With an eye open for quality. condensing programs is sensible.

Student groups such as SASU (Student Association ol‘thc Stiitc University). faculty
organizations such its their unions. and administrators should fight to maximize the
state‘s consciousness of'SU N Y. 'l‘hey may find it inthcir interest that New York City be
saved. In the final analysis. however. SU NY will be accepting cuts becauscthcrc was
too much planning in the sixties. Is that really anyonc‘s l'ault‘.’
