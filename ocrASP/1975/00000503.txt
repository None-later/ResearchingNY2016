_ Amnesty

by ‘Steven Parness

The following dialogue is, in truth. not a
totally new. one. I ﬁrst wrote it over two years
ago. when “amnesty” was an “in” issue of the
times. Of course. times have changed and
amnesty is said to be outdone. President
.Ford's “amnesty plan" was supposed to
remedy the problem. All that the ad-
ministration's plan possibly did was to close
America‘s eyes to the problem.

This “conversation” was originally written
with the Nixon administration in mind. The
idea wastoshow the wayin which our political
leaders survey the situation. Today, with
President Ford's plan a failure. and the situa-
tion primarily the same. I wrotethis second ar-
ticle. America's feelings towards the issue may
not be as strong as they once were; which is a
shame. for the draft-evader still remains out-
side of the border, and still dreams the same
dreams of one day returning home.

“This situation is getting worse every day,"
said an aide to the president.

“I know. You can never tell who is goingto
shoot at metomorrow.“ the prident replied.

“No. no. I‘m talking about amnesty forthe
men who fled the country in time of war."

“I thought I solvedthat problem." the presi-
dent said.

“Your plan has expired. sir-"

“Yes.”

“Well. you better change your mind.“

“Why.” the president asked.

“Because last week we received telegrams
from more than two thousand Canadians."

The president raised a brow. “Please con-
tinue."

“The Canadian people wrote to thank you
for your inefﬁcient amnesty program."

“Why?” the president asked.

“Well. when you made harsh requirements
of the plan. the ‘dodgers' gave up hope and
some of them got together and formed cor-
porations.“

“So?”

“These corporations they set up made many
jobs for the Canadian people. They wrote to
say that they can‘t wait forthe United States to

‘have another unconstitutional war so that

they can go ahead of the United States in in-
dustry!"

“You‘re kidding. This is the worst remark
that We heard since the last time my wife
spoke to the press." -

"I realize this,“ the aidesaid. “‘but. . .but
what ‘:'tshould we do?“

"Amnesty for all men!" the president
declared. “and have those corporations
transferred into United States property. After
all. these men are US. citizens."

“But the men are happy in Canada now.
sir.“

“This is preposterous!" the president ex-
claimed. "You mean that they don‘t want to
come back to the land of the free'!“

When was the last time you brougll
someone back to your room just to see your
etchings? If you feel that life is passing you by
because you don’t lave any, then hop right on
down toyourloeal police station or the Univer-
sity Police to have some made. For these par-
ticular etchings will be used to identifyyour
valuablesin the event of their theft.

There is a program titled Operation Iden-
tiﬁcation whereby the police have available an
engraving pen for you to etch your'social
security number on your valuables. They also
supply you with cards (to be placed in win-\
dows or doors) warning intruders that your
belongings “have been marked for readyiden-
tification by law enforcement agencies."
Operation ID has proven to be a major
deterrent against theft because there is dif-
ficulty in selling identiﬁable items. (While U n-
iversity Police are not participatingin Opera-
tion ID, they do have engraving penstolendto
students for a couple of hours at a time.)

Burglar alarms are also effective in theft
prevention. They‘re available in many
varieties ranging from small battery operated
window alarms to household systems with
sirens. Most of them can be installed easily
with nominal costs. You can get alarms at all
locksmiths and some hardware and variety
stores.

For arguments sake. let's say that Rock
DuPre. master thief. has broken into your
apartment to steal the Hope diamond he
thought you had inyourwallsafe. Upon realiz—
ing his mistake, he decides to make the best of
it anyway. You know that he has no heart
because he even took your prized Johnny
Mathis records to play on his new home enter-
tainment center that you also unwillingly
supplied. After you report it to the police. you

migln bean to wonder if you are covered by
insurance. '

Mon family homeowners policies cover you
even if you are "off the premises“. but
sometimes they set limits. You should check to
see if you are covered byyour family‘s policy.
and if there is a limit. how much? If you want
to get your own policy. tenants insurance is
your best bet. The smallest coverage available
is (still) dollars at approximatelysw to $50 per
year. It handles everything from ﬁre to tor-
nadoes and theft to riots.

Like auto insurance. an agent might not un-
derwrite a policy for you because of the risk in-
volved. Character does play a major role in his
decision and even the area you live in can
make a big difference if it is classiﬁed as a high
crime area. If you live in an apartment of four
or more. you will ﬁnd that agents will not be
anxious to give you a policy because there are
too many people and the risk of theft or acci-
dent is greater. In order to get the best deal. see
an independent insurance agent because they
represent many companies from which they
can probably ﬁnd a policy for you.

Some extra notes on security precautions. It'
you are going away and want your house look-
ed after. call the police and they willprovidca
“house watch“. where an- eye is kept on your
home while you are gone. So get prepared. and
don‘t say we didn‘t warn ya!

Mirabelli highlighted the drive with
several bursts of 7. 9 and l l-yards in
third down situations. He also had a
65-yard run wiped out by a clipping
penalty.

Both teams suffered through a
sluggish first - period which was
marred by numerous fumbles and
penalties.

“There‘s no excuse for our slow
start." Crea said. “We should have
had more points on the board. but
we‘ll take the victory. Credit .the
Army and Dartmouth games for
toughening us up for this one.“
