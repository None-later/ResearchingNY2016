People who have different jobs. different le. different interests,
different educations have completed the course. Our graduates are
people from all walks of life. These people have all taken a course
developed by Evelyn Wood, a prominent educator. Practicallywall of
them at least tripled their reading speed with equal or better com-
prehension. Most have increased it even more.

Think for a moment what that means. All of them—even the
slowest—now read an average novel in less than two hours. They
read an entire issue of Time or Newsweek in 35 minutes. They don't
skip or skim. They read every word. They use no machines. Instead,
they let the material they're reading determine how fast they read.
