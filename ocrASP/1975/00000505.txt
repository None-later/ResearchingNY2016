With 4-2‘Win At Geneseo

by Nathan Salarit

Carlos Arango scored two ﬁrst
half goals. and Frank Selca and
John Rolando also scored. as the
Albany State varsity soccer team
celebrated their leap into the
national rankings with a come-from-
behind 4-2 win versus the Geneseo
Blue Knights.

The hooters were named as one of
those teams receiving (national
honorable mention based on last
week's record of 7-H. and were
listed as number 25 in the national
soccer coach's poll.

The win at Geneseo was icing to
the national rankings cake. and rais-
ed Albany's record to 8-l-l.

“This is the ﬁrst time an Albanyg
soccer team has been mentioned in
the national polls.” said Varsity
Soccer Coach Bill Schieffelin. “Be-
ingamongthetop 25teamsinthe na-
tion is very satisfying. especially
when one remembers that in soccer
the polls do not separate the three
NCAA Divisions. It's a ﬁne com-
plimenti to all our players and this
school. -

When the Rooters took the ﬁeld
after a four-hour bus 'ride to

Geneseo. some of the fans accom-
panying the team had to wonder if
the rankings had gone to the teams‘

collective heads. as Geneseo's Chip
Reist' scored twice in the ﬁrst eight
minutes of the game to givethe hosts
a. 2-Olead.

Twenty minutes later, the Boaters
appeared to have scored when ashot
by Carlos Arango eluded Blue
Knights goalie Mark McNiven. but
the ball was headed out from under
the crossbar by Tom Arnold. and
despite some protestations by
players and fans alike. ruled no goal.

“I think that may have gotten us
going. the feeling that we were robb-
ed of a goal because the ofﬁcial was
not positive." said Schieffelin. echo-
ing the same comments of Hooters
forward Matty Denoru.

Two minutes later. Arango took a
pass fromChepeRuanoand beat Mc-
Niven to the short left side. Arango
tallied again minutes later on a
similar play. with Ruano again mak-
ing the asist.

“It was the best performance of
the year for both of them." said
Schiel'felin. “Arango now has four
goals. all fromthe halfback position.
and Ruano simply had his best game
ever at Albany."

With the score tied. 2-2. the
Booters returned f romtheir halftime
huddle and quickly put Schieffelin's
halftime advice of “putting on the

Cherubino Cops State
Invitational in 25:03.4

by Jon Lafayette

Carlo Cherubino outshined
everyone else at the ninth annual
Albany State invitational. as the
Albany senior became the ﬁrst
Albany runner to take this meet.
Saturday.

Cherubino. who was- second to
Colgate's Bruce Mason at the mile
point. took the lead at two miles. He
was able to increase his lead during-
the third mile. held of“; challenge by
New York Tech's freshman John
Little. and crossed the finish line
with a big smile on his face and arms
raised. about twenty yards ahead of
the field.

Cherubino's time. 25:03.4. was the

fastest time ever recorded by an
Albany runner at a home meet. ecli p-
sing Vinnie Reda's old record 25: I I.

It was the seventh best time ever
run on Albany‘s course. and it came
in the last race he will cverrun here.

“This is the way to go out." said
Cherubino. who will train for the
Olympics as a marathon entry for
the Italian national team,

The other Albany runners did not
turn in strong performances. Brian
Davis ﬁnished 30th and Chris Burns
was 37th (he finished ninth last year)
as Albany ﬁnished a disappointing
fifth of the ill teams that entered.

Less than two minutes later.
Rolando fired a bullet intothe upper
right corner of the net. and theteant
exploded in celebration of Rolan-
do's first goal of the season.

“Johnny is the most unselfish
playerontheteam. and alsothemost
respected and well liked.“ said
Schielfelin. “The reaction of the
whole team. including Henry
(Obwald. the goalie. who raced the
length of the ﬁeld to add his cob-
gratulations). shows we've come a
long way in building our own sense
of teamness."

“Rolando really sparked us when
he moved up to the center forward
spot.'Schieffeli n continued. “Arango
scored his ﬁrst goal just a minute or
two after that change. Rolando sets
our pace and makes the offense
move. and there is no way anytcam
can key on Sclca with Johnny up
front; he‘s just too big a threat."

In general terms. the win was very
satisfying. according to Schiefl'elin.

of us."

Danes Nail Norwich, 19-12

by Mike I’iekarskl

'l‘om DcBlois‘ two-yard plunge
capped a 70-yard touchdown drive
that led the Albany Great Danes toa
conic-l'rom—bchind l9-l2 victory
over the Norwich Cadets. at water-
logged University Ficld. Saturday.

The touchdown and the successful
two-point conversion came with
ni'ne-and-a-half minutes left in the
game and brought the Danes back
from a 12-” deﬁcit.

While the Duties picked up their
fifth win against one loss. it was not
aii exceptionally well-played game
for the hosts.

“it was not as good a game as
you‘d li kc." said Albany varsity foot-
ball couch Robert Ford. "Defensive-
ly. it was not one ofour better games
and [offensively] we had our hands
full with those two good defensive
tackles." he explained. in reference
to the Cadets‘ Vince Arduini (right
tackle) and Bob Moylen(left tackle).

but the biggest factorsin the game
were the persistent rain. the slippery
ball. and the unstable turf: the main
reasons for the eleven fum blcs com-
tnittcd by both squads.

The game got off to a slow start.
Albany received the opening kick-

off und was stopped cold on three.

plays necessitating the first of their
nine punts for the afternoon.
Norwich's attempts to advance the
ball on their lirst offensive series
proved equally fruitless. and they
too. Were forced to give up the ball.
In fact. the entire ﬁrst quarter

resembled a "hot potato" contest. as
neither team seemed capable of
holding on tothc bull long enoughto
do anything With it.

The second quarter was another
story. however. as the Danes caught
fire. Albany gained control of the
ball on tlicirowti l4 alter ti Norwich

touchdown on their first possession.
After a fifteen yard pcnalty had mov-
ed the ball to the Dane 39. quarter'—

gain. 'l‘hrec plays later. on fourth

the pocket. rolled to his right. and
connected with it wide-open Baxter
all alone at the one. for the first
touchdown of the afternoon.

0n the next play, the Danes lined
up as if attempting an extra point.
but on the snap. tltc hall ended up in
the arms of halfback Dave Duprey
who raced into the left corner of the
end zone for the two—point conver-
sion.

The teams then traded punts for
the next few minutes as neither was
able to launch a sustained drive.
With about five minutes left in the
half. the Danes received a Norwich
punt near midfield and Skip Scurry
returned it seventeen yards to the
Norwich 32. The Danes had ex-
cellent field position but could get no

closer than the ten before being‘

stopped. Al Martin kicked all-yard
field goal with 2:03 remaining and
the Danes led ll-(l at the half.

liut the lead was to hesbort-livcd.
l‘he Danes had received the second
half kick-oft and on their very first
play. they lost the ball when Orin
Griffin fumbled a licrturzi pitchotit.
Frank (iuido recovered for the
Cadets and the visitors now had a
first and tea on the Danes‘ ZS-yurd
line. Hall'htick Sam l’izrimcnti took
over from there and moved the hilll
almost single-liundcdly before
sweeping in from three yards out for
the score. Don Brown then tried for
thc two-pointer. but was gang-
tackled short of the goal-line and the
score remained ll-b.

Later in the quarter the Cadets
pounced on another Dane fumble
and turned it into another score.
Starting from the Albany 46. Cadet
quarterback Mike Palmer converted
on a third and eight situation by bit-
ting Dana O‘Brien over the middle
for a first down on the 32. Two plays
later. Palmer handed off to H7.-
rimenti on a third and two. and the
husky senior responded by busting
through a slight hole and racing all
the way down the right sideline for a
touchdown.

Palmer then tried a quarterback
sneak on the conversion attempt but
was stopped cold. and with ten
seconds left in the third quarter. the
Danes found themselves trailing l2-

trail by keeping the ball and running
