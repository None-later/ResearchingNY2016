27th district. wasn'tsureifl could be
trusted. Neither was I.

“How well do you know Leslie
Macby?" he asked. The question was
expected. My acquaintance with his
Republican opponent was un-
deniable. my work for the
Republican party as much a part of
my life as my journalistic ventures.
Conflict of interest? His concern
with my potential prejudice was as
well-founded as my own preoccupa-
tion with trying to maintain objec-
tivity.

Objectivity. however. can be
altered by personal impressions just
as easily as by external inﬂuences.
When I met with Cairns, my nonin-
volvement with that particular race
enabled me to judge him solely on
the image he presented to my then
open mind. After an hour of being
subject to a barrage of political
rhetoric. that image was set.

Thomas J. Cairns, 28. of Newton-
ville. is seeking his third term as
Albany County legislator in a race
characterized by accusation and
countervchargc. His opponent.
Leslie Macby. recently criticized
Cgirns' voting record. suggesting
collusion with the Albany
Democratic machine.

Not Part of Machine

"Nonsense." said Cairns. “You
can play a statistical game. If you
look a little further. you might dis-
cover that 75% of those votes (con-
curring with the Albany machine
votes) are housekeeping items re-
quiring a roll-call vote. Perhaps. on
those roll call votes, the majorityjust
might have been right, and she seems
to overlook that fact.“

He also asserts that his alleged
association with the Albany machine
is a myth. “ Mine is a grass roots cam-
paign." he said. “I never asked for
nor received any ﬁnancial support
from the county or town party."
Secure in his own campaign funding
procedure. he finds Maeby‘s practice
less honorable.

“My opponent sent out an appeal
for funds, saying that she would not
accept any donation over Sl00. but
the Colonic Town Republican Party
donated two and a half times that
amount. which she accepted. She has
received more money from the town

puny than any other oftheir l7 can-
didates." According to Macby. her
pledge not to accept large donations
applied only to individual con-
tributors.

Another point of debate is Cairns'
recent appointment as director ofthe
new Albany Off-Track Betting
operation. which Macby charged
was a political favor to Cairns for
voting with the machine in a move to
strip Theresa Cooke of her
budgetary powers in the county
government. Cairns defended his ap<
pointment as a “logical choice: | in-
troduced 0'“! in Albany in I973.
now we have SI million in extra
revenue from the OTB operation as a
direct result of my legislative action
and floor management.“ He added.
“Contrary to my opponents‘ mis-
guided beliefs. as 0'“) director I do
not do the hiring. and it's a time-
consuming and thankless job."

Asked why he agreed to acceptthe
position. he explained. “The (0TB)

sands

bill is something that I fought for
two years for. now in actuality it is
being developed to the fullest. I feel
very competent, and very qualiﬁed
to hold that position."

Cairns also feels competent and
qualified to hold another position.
the seat to which he seeks reelection.
His background is much like his op-
ponents. both lifelong residents of
the Town of Colonic. both having
worked on local and national cam-
paigns prior to their own can-
didacies. Cairns' candidacy for the
county legislature in l97l was his
first attempt at popular election.
Formerly a seminary student. Cairns
reevaluated his vocational direction
in I969. became politically active,
and completed his MA in Political
Science at SUNYA. His edge in this
election. and his disadvantage. lie in
his incumbcney.

"There's lI disadvantage in being
an incumbent." he said. “You‘re

There'e nothing Ilka it in the” city

 

by Jill ll. Cohen

In the Campus Center crowd. she
seemed less like a political vote-
getter than just another student. But
' if the voters of Colonie's 27th district
show their conﬁdence in Leslie A.

Macby on November 4. the 22-year-
old SUNYA student will take her
seat on the Albany County
Legislature, the youngest member
ever to serve on that body.

Macby, running on the
Republican ticket. will face
Democratic incumbent Thomas
Cairns. from whom she could wrest
the 27th district seat's support ofthe
Albany Democratic machine and
“Return the people of Colonic their
vote."

Said Macby, “The people in
Colonic pay 60% of the taxes, and
get nothing for their tax dollar."

Colonie‘s interests have been laid
aside for the interests of the Albany
machine. Macby judged from
Cairns‘ voting record. According to
a statement issued by Macby in
August. her oppdnents‘ voting
record finds him “deep in Mayor
Corning‘s pocket of political
cronies". '

Cairns was elected in the County
Legislature in 1973 as a reform
Democrat. but accordingto Macby,
he voted with the Albany machine in
56 out of 60 roll-call votes taken dur-
ing the past year;

The political career of Leslie A.
Macby has evolved rapidly over the
past ﬁve years. Since l970, she took
minor roles in the campaigns of
Assemblyman Fred Field (R-
Newtonville). Democratic Presiden-
tial candidate George McGovern.
and the Court of Appeals Judge
Charles Breitcl.

Maeby‘s association with the New
York Republican State Committee

in l973 catapulted her into the

Vlimelight of the state GOP youth

organiration. A member of SUNYA
sorority Chi Sigma Theta, she was
approached by former Chi Sig
member Cathy Bertini. then Direc-
tor of Youth Activities for the NY
Republican State Committee, to
serve as one of the ﬁrst female pages
in the NY State Senate.

Her acquaintance with Bertini led
her to becoming the director of the
1973 Republican Youth Conference
and Secretary of the New York State
College Republicans.

Today. Halloween is a festive oc-
casion with no mystic signiﬁcance
attached to it. Little children dressin
outlandish costu‘mcs. carve jack-o-
lantcrns, listen to ghost stories, and
go “trick-or-treating“ for candy and

The origin of Halloween is a com-
bination of pagan or Druidic prac-
tice. classic beliefs. and religious
superstitions. The pagans‘ obser-
vances influenced the Christian
festival of All Hallows Eve as they
were celebrated on the same date.
Gradually Halloween became a
secular observance and many
customs and praticcs developed.

The Druids believed thatOctobcr
Jl wasthe end ofthc old year and the
new year must be ushered in with‘a
festival to appease Sumhain. their
god of Death. Samhain would
gather all the souls of the dead and
decide what form ctteli would
assume for the coming year. Accor-
ding to the legend. the good souls
entered the body of another human
being. but the bad souls \vere con-
demned to cntcrthe body ofanimtils.
Sacriﬁces were made to the god of

dingto Voit. this is the first ycarthat
the Office of Student Life has cori-
ccrncd itself with students living off
campus. Voit feels lliat many OCA
anti Office of Sttidcnt Life concerns
in this area will overlap. (Voit‘s
responsibilities will probably
overlap also. In addition to his posi-
tion with OCA. Voit scrvcsas a part-
iimc intern in the Office of Student
Life.)

lit-sides protuling pertinent infor-
mation tor oll-cnnipus students,
Voit feels lliat ()L‘A has ti respon-
sibility to help students become a
part of i he community in which they
are living. “(ioing to college is not
[jtist| an iIL‘ildCllilC education.“ says
Voit. "it should be at life education."
He also feels that off-campus
students need to realize that. as a
group. they face many similar
problems. “We need to mobilize off—
campus students.“ Voit says.

As for OCA‘s future, liatiman
feels lliat the establishment of this
group as an organization com-
parable to llinghamton‘s Off Cam-
pus College “would be of course be
our goal.“ However he admits that
this will havcto he a long-range goal.
According to Voit. “The potential is
there. [but] resources and person-
powcr are hard to come by." OCA is
SA funded with a first year operating
budget of SIZOO. All OCA persons
are non-salaried. This compares
with the 854.000 budget which
Binghamton‘s OCC had to work
with last year.

Bauman feels that eventually
OCA will be able to provide bothin-

Voit strongly emphasizes that
OCA wants and needs input from

The custom of carving jack-6-
laterns originated in Ireland. The
tale goes like this: A stingydrunltard
named 'Jack tricked the devil into
climbing an apple tree. He quickly
carved the sign of the cross into the
trunk to prevent the devil from com-
ing down. .lack then made the devil
swear never to get revenge on him or
claim his soul in any possible way.
Jack eventually died. Because of his
parsimonious ways. Jack was for-
bidden to enter heaven. The only
recourse was for Jack to go to hell.
However. the devil was true to his
word and would not claim his soul.
Thus Jack was condemned to walk
the earth forever with hislantern(a
carved out turnip with a candle in-
side) looking for it place to rest his
soul.

When the Scots and Irish brought
the Halloween traditions to
America. the pumpkin was sub-
stituted for the turnip. and much of
iltc meaning ol'the holiday has since
been lost.

l'oday Halloween is a boon to the
candy industry and its original
mysticism is now measured in
