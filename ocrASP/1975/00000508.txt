he believes are being torn down
systematically. “There is an organis-
ed determined effort to destroy every
one of my signs. but I‘m gettingsym-
pathy because of that."

His campaign activities, however.
will not be as important an inﬂuence
on the Colonic voters as his “service
to the people in the district. and to

[his] record.“ as he perceives the ,

situation. As county legislator.
Cairns has directed his efforts
towards reform of the county
legislature.

“We took 23 committees and con-
densed them into l3 active. working
segments of county government.“ he
said. “Now every legislator has a
copy of the agenda 48 hours prior to
each meeting. and we now meet
monthly instead of four times a
year.” He continued. “The facts are
glaring. These are improvements;
they are in the law today."

Cairns noted further im-
provements that he would like to see
implemented during histhird term as
legislator. including “a charter
review commission to look into the
ofﬁce of county executive. more
capital programs, more relief for the
taxpayer." In the eyes of Thomas J.
Cairns. the election is a “clearchoice
between one solid legislative record
and a candidate with absolutely no
experience and a severe lack of
knowledge of county affairs.“

nent. in contrast. has done little to
protect his seat. “He bought a
Chevyvan." she said.

The 27th district contains 3400
votes: I600 registered Republicans.
500 Democrats. and IZOD blanks.
The blanks are “mostly young peo-
ple" according to Maeby. and result
from a "movement away from party
afﬁliation  there is a feelingthat in—
telligent voting is associated with in-
dependent voting. which is not
necessarily true."

What is true is that what Maeby
sees as the Albany County

‘ Legislature's neglect of the needs of
the people of Colonic is something
she feels should be changed. If
elected. she says she would try to br-
ing in County health facilities. more
county highways. and increase the
revenue from the landing fees at
Albany County Airport.

TRIPPING DICK

Grace Slick of the Jefferson
Starship says she once attempted to
slip some LSD to Richard Nixon.

Grace has been invited in I970 by
Tricia Nixon to attend a White
House tea because both she and‘
Tricia were Alumnae of Finch
College.

Grace. however. was turned away
at the door of the White House by
secret service agents because she
showed up with an old friend. Abbie
Hoffman.

In an interview with Stereo
Review. Grace admits that she was
carrying 600 "mics" of acid at the
time. She says: “We were aiming for
the old dad. hoping he might cometo
the party and have a cup of tea."

 

WHO’S A HIPPIE?

What‘s the difference between a
"hippie" who decides to drop out
and a dedicated anti-war activist‘.’

Believcit or uot.the C.l.A. backin
Noll conducted a secret study into
this question and came up with an
answer.

A newly—declassified document
reveals the CIA. concluded that

many of the “hippies” or» social
dropouts of the l960‘s were the
children of Republican families.
That same study found that most
anti-war activists came. not from
Republican homes.-but from the
homes of liberal but "establishment"
Democrats.

These conclusions and others are
spelled out in a 4l-page C.l.A. study.
titled “ Restless Youth.“ obtained by
the C cater for National Security
Studies. The report was released
after the center filed suit against the
agency under the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act.

A major conclusion of the
"Restless Youth" report is that the
American anti-war movement was
not being infiltrated. financed or
manipulated by “communist
authority" from abroad. The report
stated: Wl'hcrc is no convincing
evidence of control. manipulation.
sponsorship or significant financial
support of student dissidents by any
international communist authority."

Although the was report un-
covered no foreign involvement in
the American peace movement. less
than two years later. in I970. top
C. LA. officials authorized the illegal
surveillance of American activists.

they later justified this spying by

suggesting that foreign powors were
behind the protests.

 

AIOMINAILE APE .
An American. zoologist. who
spent three years on a scientific ex-
pedition in the Himalayas. claims
that the “abominable snowman" is

real.

f

However. the researcher. Edward
Cronin. says that the famed creature
is not as abominable as he or she is
cracked up to be. and is probably
just a shy. shaggy flat-footed ape.

Cronin and another
scientist. Doctor Howard Emery.
writing in the November issue of
Atlantic magazine. say they camped
in a wilderness area ofthe Himalayas
in I972. in the middle of a snow-
covercd meadow.

They say they awoke the next
morning and discovered bare-footed
human-like footprints leading

The Sherpa guides who were with
them identified the tracks as those of
the fearsome “Yete.” The scientists
conclude that the two-footed animal
that left the tracks was a small.
adolescent. “Yete” by “Abominable
Snowman“ standards. weighing only
I65 pounds. ‘

Cronin says that the creature is
most probably either a known
species of shaggy-haired ape in a
deformed or “abnormal condition."
or a new form of primate. ‘

BOMBING BATTLE

An Air Force ofﬁcer. who ob-
jected to tiring missiles containing
nuclear warheads at civilian targets.
has been discharged from the ser-
vice.

'l'he officer. Captain John
Vundermolen. was first sent to a psy-
chiatrist and then later discharged
from the Air Force after saying he
would aim missiles at military
targets. but not at civilian popula-
tion centers.

Vandermolen says that after he
objected to civilian areas being
nuclear targets. he was told only the
president may decide what targets
are selected. Vandcrmolen has filed
suit against the Air Force asking for
back pay and that his service record
be cleared.

HICCUPS ARE HELL

A 56-year—old West German man
leaped to his death earlier this week
apparently because he was unable to
cure a severe case of the hiccups that
had plagued him for two years.

Doctors estimate that Heinz
Iseckc had hiccuped 36 milliontimcs
since a stomach operation was per-
formed on him in November of I973.
Police say that lsccke became in—
creasineg dcspondcnt after
thousands of suggestions on how to
cure the liuccups. mailed to him
from aroundthc world. had allfailed

An l-‘,ll.l. interview with Mercer.
conducted on the day followingthe
assassination. says only that Mercer
saw two men at the assassination
scene with what looked like a rifle
case. One ofthe two men is described
as being “heavy-set" and about 45-
ycars-old. a rough. general descrip-
tion that could fit Ruby.

However. Mercer‘s new statement
says that the F.B.I. showed her
several picture photographs on the
day after the assassination. one of
them of Ruby. She states that after
she identified the face in one of the
pictures. the l‘.B.l. agent who show-
cd her the snapshot turned it over.
and the name “Jack Ruby“ was
written on the back of it.

Garrison. in a speech before the

weekend. stated that the F.B.l.
deliberately suppressed Mercer‘s
original testimony.
