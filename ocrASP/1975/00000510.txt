This is merely a sample of what is
commonly considered a “slice‘of life”
to show soap opera audiencesthat-
we are not alone in ourtroables. The
philosophy of the Daytime Drama
writers seems to be that if we all see
how bad life can be maybe then we
can forget how bad life really is.

01‘ course, soap operas aren‘t
tragedies all the time. For instance.
take the time that Vicky of One Life
to Live is finally cured of
schizophrenia and now she and Joe
can finally get married as they had
always dreamed. But two weeks
later. Joe's car goes over a cliff and

The Claaalcol Peru--

The Curse of

In 1801 two smartly dressed
English travellers walked down a
dusty road towards the poor Greek
village of Lefsina. Thoroughly
schooled in the lore of ancient
Greece. these travellers knew they
were nearing the site of Eleusis,
where in antiquity the wheat goddess
Demeter was worshipped asthe dei-
ty which brought fertility to the
crops. As they neared the village
something caught their eye. and in a
few moments they found themselves
standing in astonishment before a
beautiful ancient statue. a prize
worthy ol‘any museum in the world.
It was a marble statue of a woman.
bill they restrained themselves from
closely examining the statue. It was
not. hOWever. their aesthetic ap-
preciation which restrained them but
a peculiar practice oi~ the local

The soap opera actor deserves
some credit. We can all understand
why these actors performances are
all so true to life. They are living ex-
amples of tragedies, for they must
live in fear of having the characters

was venerated by the locals as St.
Demetra and was thought to bring
fertility to the land; the villagers
evidently intended to return the
compliment.

The Englishmen. thinking the
statue could be more fully -ap—
preciated in different surroundings.
negotiated with the villagers to buy
the statue and remove it to a British
musaum. But the villagers objected,
on the basis that the statue was
sacred and that it brought fertility to
their fields. The Englishmen politely
pointed out that the fields would
probably appreciate the manure
more than the statue did. and so
everyone would be happy. The
villagers linally gave in and con-
sented to the purchase. but with the
warning that disaster would surcl

carried it would never reach port.
These dire predictions did not.
however. deter the Englishmen. who
immediately began to undung the
statue. 'l‘heyput the statue aboard

England. But as luck would have it.
the ship was indeed wrecked and lost
on t he way home. The statue was 1' or-
tunately saved and is now in the
l-itzwilliam Museum at Cambridge.

Ancient Greek statues have been

some nobler than others. The cir-
cumstances attending the discovery
of the statue at Elcusis are unique.
And while these circumstances could

are nonetheless completely
