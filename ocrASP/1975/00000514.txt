Recs-Relations . Q .,

To thallium .

3 I am writing in response to Mr. Graham's

article (October 24) about blacks on campus.

. The article was an insult to the intelligenceof
every student atrthis university. It is true that

there is a' problem of, racial relations at

SUNYA. but Mr. Graham distorts it com-

. pleter with lies. illogical thinking and racist

' attitudes. I would like to point out the way Mr.
Graham perverts the truth to fit his warped
view of reality. .

First of all, Mr.Graham contends that
blacks cannot get elected to Central Council
or any other student government position. He
is obviously ignoring the fact that Andy
Bauman. the SA president. was elected with
less than 1000 votes. If blacks got behind one
candidate for president and ran their own can-
didstes for Central Council at every quad. the
SA president would be black and so would
half of Central Council.

Mr. Graham claims that SA "...would like

' to get rid of BOPSA and control the activities
of blacks and other minorities." What is being
conveniently forgotten is that EOPSA has the
second highest budget of any student group on
campus. This amount is more than propor-
tional to the amount “of students that this
organization represents. Incidentally. EOPSA
supposedly represents all students of EOP. I
doubt very much that EOPSA represents the
non~blacks on EOP.

What does Mr. Graham mean when he says
that groups like WSUA and the ASP do not
seek out blacks‘l How do these organizations
seek out whites? At the beginning of each
semester they hold interest meetings for
whoever wants to join. If more blacks than
whites came to these meetings. the radio sta-
tion and the newspaper would be black
oriented.

Mr. Graham also states the “some whites
have attitudes towards blacks that tend to
make some blacks develop low opinions of
whites.” Then Mr. Graham turns around and
claims “many whites feel that blacks have a
bad general attitude toward whites. Through
this circular logic one can surmise that blacks
hate whites because whites hate blacks and
whites hate blacks because blacks hate whites.
Out of this nonsense Mr. Graham concludes
that it is all right for blacks to hate whites
because whites hate blacks but it is wrong for
whites to hate blacks because: I) whites prac-
tice subtle prejudice (opposed to blatant
predicc which I assume Mr. Graham is imply-
ing that blacks practice) and 2) whites arethc
majority so they have no right to hate blacks.
This type of reasoning makes Mr. Graham
eligible for the Lester Maddox school of race
relations.

In the tradition of the late Senator Joseph
McCarthy. Mr. Graham makes sweeping
generalizations without any proof. _It is claim-
ed that Coach Sauers discriminates against
blacks. I would like to sec him provcthat. Mr.
Graham admits himself that winning is the
prime motive for any good coach. Doc. Sauers
if known as a fine person as well as coach and
would never let racial attitudes inﬂuence his
desire to have a winning team. The article also
claims that there is a rap against blacks that
they are too wild and can't blend into a team.
Mr. Graham must have made that up himself

' because no such rap exists and if it did, there
wouldn't be any blacks playing basketball at
all. Then, continuing in a bigoted line of
reasoning. it is claimed that blacks should play
and whites shouldn't because “blacks tend toi
have more speed and leaping ability and are
more gifted than whites." A white person

could be equally as bigoted and claim that.
blacks aren‘t as intelligent as whites and'

therefore blacks should only be allowed to
have menial jobs.

I think Mr. Graham realizes whatan absurd
and patronizingarticle he has written. In con-
cluding. he tries to wriggle out of the mess he
has created by claiming that his work might
confuse and anger both blacks and whites.

To the Editor .

Res “Blacks on Campus” by KeithGraham.
Oct. 24. ' ‘

As a white student. new to the SUNYA
campus. I've. too. noticed attitudes exhibited
by some blacks on this campus that are con-
siderably. unlike the attitudes of blacks I've
previously associated with. whether it had
been in a business or an educational environ-
ment.

Mr. Graham concludes his article with

~"‘. . . we all have to live together, so we all

mightlas well tryto get along." I wholehearted-
ly agree. However. I find this last sentence
grossly inconsistent with a statement made in
the same paragraph: “Whites shouldn't expect
blacks to respect them unless they deserve it.
This applies to blacks too. but whites have to
do more . . . If you hate blacks, don't act
phony because it shows . . ."

What must a white do to elicit a black‘s
respect? Mr. Graham. please be advised that
we are all human beings, deserving of mutual
respect and the common courtesies of daily
living. If. for instance. one is going througha
door and someone else is close behind. an
attempt should be made not to let the door
slam in that person‘s face regardless of
whether that person happens to be of another
race. Unfortunately. the door has been slamm-
ed in front of me by blacks many more times
than it has been by whites. and consideringthe
percentage of blacks on this campus, it seems
to be more than just a coincidental prevalence
of ill manners.

I‘ve always dealt with_ petty incidents such as
these on the basis of the manifold inequities.
that blacks in general have had to deal with
throughout history. Ifeel no hatred. But your
pathetic suggestion that hatred. if felt. should
not be repressed in order not to be phony. can
only exacerbate an already regrettable situa-
tion. Attempt to envision. if you will. what this
campus would be like if everyone. in order not
to be phony. openly exhibited their true
feelings about everyone else.

Mr. Graham, you may find it increasingly
difficult to win sympathizers with your sen-
timents regarding the black situation if you
continue to display your lack of knowledge of
the very rudiments of human relations.

Amplifications

To the Editor:

On Sunday. October 5. I975. I went to
my first Dutch Quad Board meeting. The
reason for my attending said meeting was to
ask a sort of a favor from the Board. What I
wished to ask was whether I would be able to
borrow the recently purchased “Coffee
House" amplifier. After much arguing l was
turned down by a vote of eight to seven. The
reason for my request was that I wasin a bind.
I needed to borrow the amp for an audition to
perform in the Rathskcllar Pub on Tuesday
(October 28).

The reasonsgivenfor my beingturned down,
were few and in my opinion. weak arguments.
I was told that if it is lent out to one person.
others must be allowed to borrowe it. On this
point we agreed and that is all that we agreed
on. I see nothing wrong with loaning out the
amp. especially since it was paid for with stu-
dent tax money. Why shouldn't students be
allowed to take advantage of things purchased.
with their money?

The reasoning of the Quad Board on the
above mentioned point was that the amp

- P
borrower 7 takes -; full

",llli
would not be valid, that a person could not‘be

pay ythe‘ cost

-heldtoit.'w N 
Anyone that knows anythingabout- law.»
knows that a contract is a legally; binding .

agreement. As long as the contract is properly
drawn up and includes all the terms and re«
quirements of the contract in an understan-

dable and definite form. and as long as the v

borrower signs it. that person can be held to
the terms specified in the contract:
What lam now suggesting is that the Dutch

' Quad Board be willing‘to loan out the amp in

situations where. is it absolutely necessary.
where none other can be obtained. Why
should something paid for out of students tax
money be locked up in a room and used just
once a week? Students should be allowed to
borrow the system if it is absolutely necessary.
after all the $350.00 spent on it is the student
taxes at work. Why should they work just for
the few who participate or attend the Dutch
Quad Coffee House, of which I am one of the
participants.

Most students don‘t realize that 8750.00 of
taxes were allocated to the Coffee House.
This is a letter for student rights. the right to
take advantage of what is purchased with our
money. It is a matterof general principle for
the future. a principle to enjoy what we pay
for. I hope that there are those people reading
this that agree with me, as did seven members
of Dutch l Quad Board.

Anti-Semitic Voz

To the Editor:

Duringa philosophy class I was disgustedto
learn of an article published in La Voz Del
Pueblo. a newspaper distributed around cam-
pus. This was the Friday October l7. I975
issue. and I quote: “the purpose forthe coali-
tion was that we (Esposa) felt that ‘minorities‘
were being‘fuckedover‘ bythe apathetic. white
jewish (note the small “j"). male dominated
majority on this campus . . .“

The article was saying that the Puerto Rican
students feel they are being slighted at
SUNYA. Our class discussion revolved not
around this issue. but rather on the word
"jewish". Yes, there is a large Jewish popula-
tion (mostly apathetic) on campus. but since
when are the Jews dominating any other
group? Since when are they “fucking over“
Fuerza Latina or any other l’uerto Rican
group? Historically. it has always been the
Jews who have supported civil rights and
liberties for all people. The Jews at SUNYA
are not favored over any other ethnic group —
simply check the SA budget allotments. To
me. as a Jew. this article reeks of the anti-
scmitism to which too many Jews have simply
become accustomed. In the October 28 issue
of the A SI’, an article was published on the re-
cent statement by Daniel I’. Moynihan. US.
ambassador to the UN. It reported his state-
ment on “Face the Nation“ that the proposed
resolution declaring Zionism a form of racial
discrimination was fundamentally an attack
against Israel. I doubt that Mr. Moynihun is
Jewish. and yet he sees anti-semitism where it
occurs. Why doesn't everyone else? What
right does the Pueno Rican newspaper have to
publish such a statement?

I am continually heartbroken by the hidden
and blatant anti-semitism in the world. One
need not look far to find it. or digdeeptosee it

——it's there. I simply ask why? It seems the
world cannot get along without fighting. and it
is often the idealistic college student who
wonders at this. Yet, heredn our campus we
hear such prejudiced remarks. It is ourgenera-
tion who will be in the “world” in a few years.
Is this what kind of attitude I should expectto
find?

I am all for Puerto Rican and Black rights.
They have as much right to their voice as do
any other group. The cliche “some of my best
friends are Black” is not a cliche if applied to
me —— simply the truth. However. the Puerto
Rican newspaper had no right to publish an

Zionism :

A Definition

To the Editor:

In a school wheresuch alarge percent of the
student body is Jewish. I find it fittingto sub-
mit the following with the hope that Albany's
Jewish population will unite. and workto pre-
vent a serious international outbreak of ant-
semitism.

The U N's current debate obverthe question

of Zionism being a form of racism takes me
back to otherirrational actions by theUN after
the Six Day War in I967. From that time on
there has been much argument about who
should control the Old City of Jerusalem.
which houses several historic sites for Jews.
Christians, and Moslems alike. One proposed
solution was to have the city be neutral. under
U N control. I wonder why this discussion was
even necessary. Before the I967 war. the city
was a part of Jordan. and Jews were forbidden
to visit. much less worshipat their holy places.
At that time there was no discussion ofan in-
ternational Jersalem. Forthe past eight years.
Jermaiem has fallen within Israeli boundaries.
Jews maypray at the Western Wall. Christians
visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. and
Moslems fill the Mosque of Omar daily. Why
now. when there is religious freedom striving
in Jersalem does the world question the
properness of its government? Putting all
rhetoric aside. it is clear that problem exists
only because the city lies in Israel. and Israel's
leaders arc Jews. I can think of no otherterm
to define such action except for anti-semitism.
The same is true now.

In its definition. modern Zionism strives for
the building of a Jewish homeland in Israel.
Homeland means a ccntcrfor the cultural and
religious growth of the Jewish I’eoplc.

Nowhere in its doctrines does Zionism say
that others may not. In fact. Israel's Declara—
tion of Independence calls for Jews and Arabs
to live and work together in peace. Anyone
can live. work. pray. and travelfreelyin Israel.

Let those world leaders who have spoken
out against racism worry about the school
boycotts in Boston. the jobless and illiterate
minority groups in America. the imprisoned
and tortured in Russia and Syria. In these
places human beings are denied freedom and
opportunity. Israel is a free nation. Her
problems of unequal opportunities or govern—
ment problems are natural to any country and
have nothing to do with the Zionist move-
merit.

That the nations ofthe world have chosen to
strike out ayinst this. and not against those
movements and countries where racism does
exist in concrete buns. is clearly an act of uni-
t y against the Jewish People. If the Jews of the
twentieth century are to auruive. they must not
let this happen.

Bureaucracy:

Is It Woth the Money

The bureaucracy strikes again. The victim
this time is William C. Bush. Mr, Bush is II
bureaucrat with the George C. Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville. Alabama. He
complained to his superiors that his position
did not give him enough work to do. In fact.
Mr. Bush reports. it keeps him busy for only
between ten minutes and an hour every day.

Feeling outraged at this waste of the tax-
paycrs money. Mr. Bush requested more
work. 'I he man wanted tofch Worth the $32:
400 a your lie was being paid. The bureaucracy
responded to this problem by filing a notice of
intent to remove Mr. Bush. The reason? It
wasn‘t lack of funds. NASA. who is his
employer simply says that Bush's desire to do
hisjob has subjected the wholcfcdcrul govern-
ment to public ridicule.

NASA's priorities seem a little skewed. It
would seem to me that a cost conscious public
servant like William Bush would be exactly
the kind of official that NASA and all other
administrative agencies should be actively
searching for, not ﬁring.

Why is the bureaucracy so frightened of
People that bringthese kind of problems to the
Public's attention? Certainly the American
people have a right to know whentheir money
"f beinl so ﬂagrantly thrown away. Do agen-
act like NASA feel thatthey should not beac-
countable for their mistakes?

The bureaucracy does not function for its
own sake. Like all branches of the govern-
"Ifﬂl. it exists to benefit the people. When il
fans in that function. people should scream.

and the bureaucracyshould be thankful for in- '
ternal attempts at righting a ship that is ob-

 

hy (.‘ordon Kurp..
viously off its course.

'I he bureaucracy. like too much of govern-
ment has become overly insulated from public
influence. Many regulatory agencies are much
more beholden to the industries they exist to
regulate than they are to the public interest.

And as it stands the burcuucrucyis perhaps
the potentially most dangerous branch of
government. It has grown in size to become
practically u fourth coordinate branch of
gotcrnmcnt. liut unlike the executive.
lchslIilivc. and Judicial branches. there exist
no constttutiomil limitations on it,

So what can we do when this bureaucratic
behemoth raises its head in our direction?
SIncc our tax dollars are paying for all these
agencies. we should have some say in all of
this. shouldn't we? But have you cvertricd that
lure of reasoning with a civil servant who
you‘ve had a problem with? I did once. He
stopped pushing papers long enough to say:
when you locntcthetwo cents your fathercon-
tribntcd to my salary. you can gladly have it
back,

So we're back to Congress. the place where
agencies are created and destroyed. Take out
your pen and write your congressman a letter.
Inform him in no uncertain terms you think
NASA should not only give William C. Bush
more work to do. but they should paste a gold
star on his forehead. too. v

And in the future. when Congress decides

. that a problem is worthy of creatingan agency
i to solve it. whip out your pen one more um

and ask that same congressman: is this agency
really. really necessary?

hopefully it will be passed by this coming session there is no reason to continue to be

wasteful on this campus.

Bubbles.

For less money than anyone realizes. this university could invest in “bubble”
buildings constructed over the tennis courts. If prime time were sold at commericial
rates (leaving off hours for students, faculty or the tennis team) the investment should

be returned in one season.

Playing tennis during the winter in heated bubbles of canvas and other materials has
become common throughout the northern states. The market in the university and the
community is waiting; the tennis courts are here. ‘

Unless there are serious problems with air pressure and the fences Surrounding the
courts, Faculty-Student Association. Student Association or the  iiersity itself
should seize this opportunity to increase service and probably make mdnEy at the satire

time.

Question: If. Bill Schicffelin and two unpaid assistants are the ‘oii ly coaching staff for
the SU NYA soccer team. how come that team was rated in the top twenty-five teams

nationwide?

Question: If SUNYA does not give athletic scholarships, how is the Great Dane
football team considered eighth in the country in the Lambert Ratings(Divisions Two

and Three)?

Question: How did the lacrosse team go from a disaster season two years ago to
getting into the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference?
Question: Why does SUNYA’s tennis team not only win the SUNY conference but

conlrol it?

SUNYA isn't an athletic schooI.There‘isn't a field house. a large intercollegiate
coaching staffs or overwhelming university interest. In addition, intercollegiate sports
at SUNYA is paid for by student tax money when by all rights and precedents they
should be supported completely by the state. On this campus there is a dispute as to the
principle of intercollegiate sports. whether or not they are psychologically damaging.
There have been problems with adjustingtothe recent legal requirements pertainingto

women’s sports.

Throughout it all SUNYA‘s teams are winning. They aren't only doing well; they are
reaching the highest attainable levels. And whatever feelings one may have about

intercollegiate athletics. that‘s impressive.
