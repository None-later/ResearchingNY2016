The tempo of the game sIOWed up

earlier torrential pace until midway
through the second half.

Union again came out ﬁghting
and dominated the opening ten
minutes of the second half.

Gellman, with the help of some out-

standing defensive plays. Gellman

stopped Ian McKintosh, a Union

After the game Gellman said, “I
should have had it. I misjudged it.”

The scoring was over but Union
kept pressing. seemingly inspired by
the Albany vs. Union varsity match-
up taking place on the next field.

The Pups ended a very successful
season on a winning note for a final
record of 7-2. including wins in their
last six games. “ Look at the statistica‘
and the record. they speak for
themselves," said Pups‘ rookiecoach
Evan Congress.
