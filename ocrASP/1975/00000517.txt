game to break a 2-2 tie and send the
Albany State varsity team down to
its second defeat of the season. 3-2.
The Booters. now 8-2- 1 .took a 2-0
lead in the first ten minutes of the
game on goals by Frank Selca (his
16th. tying him for the all time single
season scoring mark) and John
Rolando. But Denio broke the ice
for Union midway through the first

half. and Jeffries tied matters at
35:00.

“Our' defense kept backing into
the penalty area.“ said Albany‘s
coach Bill Schieffelin. "When we did
take control of the half we generally
overhandled it. enabling them to
keep the pressure on us."

Both teams missed several scoring
opportunities in the second half as
Albany's Henry Obwald and the
visitor’s Mark Ruczinski were out-
standing in the nets. '

,Ruggers ‘Scrum’tious;
Shut Out Union, 10-0

by Ken Kurt:

The Albany State Rugby Club
defeated their Union counterpart.
10—0. Saturday.

The game was played as a result of
the scheduling difficulties experienc-
ed by both teams. State was
scheduled to play powerful Boston
College. while Union was to oppose
Cortland. but because of a schedul-
ing conﬂict, neitherteam’s opponent
was able to show. Hence. State and
Union decided to play each other.

The field was a quagmire. and it
rained throughout the game. with
sloppy play by both teams resulting.
A few minutes intothe gamclthc U n-
inn hooker had to leave the game

because of a head injury. The rest of_

the half consisted of each team
trading numerous punts. Neither
team scored. even though Albany
had a one man advantage. Union
had a scoring opportunity shortly
before the end of the half. but failed
to convert when Union's kicker, liill
Fellows, missed a tWenty yard field
goal attempt.

“That kick would have madequite
a difference." said Albany coach
Chuck Rappazwiﬂf Union scored
first. they Would have had the
momentum. which is vital. especially
in the ruin."

Second half action was much the
same as the first hall‘s. Both teams
jockeyed for position via punt ex-
changes.

“With conditions as they Were.

punting was the only strategy._

because it might result in a fumble by
Union‘s fullback. giving us the need-
ed break." explained Rappano.

Albany's first score was a result of
this strategy. Union fumbled a punt
deep in their own territory. giving
Albany their first break in the game.
The serum managed to push the ball
over the goal line and chces
Rodriguez downed the bull in the
endzone for four points. Steve
(ioltlierg added the conversion.
making it 6-0.

Albany's final score of the after-
noon was again the result ofthc kick-
ing game. Rappuno punted the ball
out of bounds inside Union‘s ten
yard line. State went into its set
scrum formation. ttnd I’cte Rizzo
scrambled in for the score. The con-
version attempt was missed.

”‘i'he serum was all important. air
they beat Union in all phases of'llne
play". said Rappauu. "Offensiver it
was the serum. and dcl‘cnsivoly. the
game belonged to the bricks." The
ruggers. next contest will be Satur-
day at Sienu College.

With 30 minutes left in the game. a
centering pass by Simon Curanovie
was headedjust over the crossbar by
Rolando. Minutes later. a shot by
Paul Schicsel squirmed loose from a
sprawled Ruczinski and rolled ever
so slowly towards the right corner of
the Union goal. but Ruczinskijack-
knifed off the ground and managed
to tip the ball just wide ofthe post
before it crossed the goal line.

Dcnio and Jeffries each missed ex-
cellent scoring opportunities.
Denio‘s came at 30:15 when. after
Obwald made two consecutive saves.
the Albany defense did not clear the
ball out of the penalty area. and
Denio had an open l5-yurd shot at
the Booters‘ net. The shot hit the
post and was kicked clear by Ricar-
do Rose.

.lcff'ries was stopped twice in the
next ten minutes on diving saves by
Ohwald. before the game winner was
put in off the right post at 44:16.

“It was just a matter of time.“ Jet'-
frics later said. "We knew we were
better than they (Albany) were.“

Schicl'fclin. though disappointed.
said Albany played fairly well.

“We had No very fine teams out
there.“ Schicff'clin said. “'l‘hingsjust
went the wrong way from our

Union's John Denlo (14) sets up for downﬂeld pass.

perspective. We certainly had our
chances on those shots by Rolando
and Schiesel. and with Henry play-
ing his best game ofthc year. we were
in it.“

"Obviously a lot of the guys are
very disappointed." Schicffelin con-
tinued. “but we were. and very rnirch
arc. in the thick of things for an
NCAA Tournament bid. Had We
won against Union. we pretty mueh
would have solidified that bid. Now.
we‘ve got to go out and do some wi n-
ning this weekend in liufl'nlo."

“This could be very good for us in
it way." Schicffcfin summarivcd.
“After all. if you want a bid you have
to go out and get it."

Albany is top-seeded in this year's
edition of the University Center
Championship which pits the
Boutch against Buffalo. and

Hi nghamt on against Stony Brook. in
the first round. Schielfclin has
elected to play at 12 noon. Friday
(thctop-sccd always gets its choice of
the early or 2230 game).

Albany: 'l‘ourney Favorite

Albany is the prc-tournumcnt
favorite. The Hooters have scored six
less goals than the combined total of
Stony Brook. llinglurrnton.and Buf-
falo.

“If we win the tournament we
should be in a solid position for an
NCAA bid." said Schiel'f'clin. “and
there is no reason why we should not
win it. Going in we‘ll be healthy
(Arthur llcdford and Mark Wcmcl
sat out most ofthc Union game with
injuries). it‘s just a matter of going
out there and makingthc right plays
at the right time. something we j ust
did not do against Union."

Danes: Can They Cage Lions?

by Craig Bell

When the Albany Great Dane
football team takes the field Satur-
day against Albright College.
number four ranked Albany will be
pitted against the number six ranked
lions.

Both teams will gointo Sat urday's
contest with 5-1 records. and Dunc
coach liob Ford thinks it will be a
hell of a game. .

“They are a tough. hard nosed
football team whose only loss has
come at the hands of Gettysburgh. a
division 11 school." said Ford.

Offensiver the Lions are a big
play football team.

"They don‘t have the capability to
just drive on you." said Ford.
“because of their lack of size in the

backfield.“

'l'heir backfield will be made upof'
fullback Dun Daley. and half'backs
Fran Franks and liill Uallcn. 'l'he
quarterback will be l’at Sharp.

Franks is the team‘s leading
ground gainer with Hit-yards on 104
carries.

Sharp has completed 19 of 31
passes ofthc ycarfor 22‘) yards. most
of them to split end .loc Yahone.

Del‘cnsivcly the Danes will have to
keep the Lions‘ quick backs from
getting outside. as Well as protecting
against the big play.

“We'll be in our base defenses."
explained Ford. “that way our
defense won‘t be stretched.“ We
hope that our offense doesn't cough
up the ball and we'll have to curtail

their kickoff and punt return game.“

Of'f'cnsivcly the Danes will bedcul-
ing with a defense Ford likens to
Ithaca.

“They are bigund strong and love
to hit. in addition they don‘t scemlo
have any particular weakness."

'lhcy operate out of a 5-2 slant
defense which means they will be
keying to the wide side of the field

“We will have to use all facets of
our offense." said Ford. “ We must be
able to run inside. outside and pass
the ball. If we dothcsc things and do
them well. i believe we can beat
Albright."

“This is a big game for both
squads because the winner could
possibly receive a post season bid.“
Ford concluded.

Hartley:New Students May

Have To Find Own Housing

by More Love

Despite a SUNY-wide construc-
tion moratorium. the student poo
ulntion at Albany is still projectedto
clitnb. according to Vice President
for Management and Planning.
.lohn Hartley. “Students will simply
have to live off campus.“ he said.

l-lurtlcy indicated that there is a
growth of 350 students projected for
next year (assuming the requested
funding is approved). By 1980 the
population is to increase to 13.500
from the present 12.500 student pop-
ulation.

One of the proposed solutions to
the housing problem at SUNYA is
that Mohawk 'l‘ower bc reconvened
into a dormitory facility. This would
now have to be postponed until the
termination of the moratorium.
because it was to be state funded.
Hartley commented that the univer-
sity is not immune to the state's
financial problems. and that “there
may beatimcthat we will haveto say
to students. ‘if you want housing.~
you can‘t come.‘ "

Director of Housing John Welty
suggested that “if the enrollment
growth occurs at the graduate level.
it will not affect housing; more
graduates would enroll and only a
small percentage would request on-
campus housing." llut with graduate
programs being dropped and
suspended. Welty agreed that this is
unlikely to occur immediately.

'l'retnendous Effort

SA Vice President Rick Mccklcr
said. “The university will have to
make a tremendous effort to rebuild
the graduate department. and I think
that will solve a lot of problems."

Mccklcr suggested that the univer—
sity pursue the development and etc
pansion of the “Student Dwellings
Corporation." which would build
apartments for students.

"We would get a contractor that
would build apartments." said
Meckler. "and then rent the facilities
out to students to pay 1 he mortgage."
The original funding would come
from “outside sources." according to
Meckler.

Another solution still under con-
sideration is the construction of
prefabricated housing. Despite some
of its problems. Welty said that the
construction of this housing“wasn't
intended to use state funds. so it is
not eliminated.“

Also affected by the moratorium
is the downtown campus. whose
badly needed rehabilitation
(estimated cost: $1,000,000) will be
"We‘re terribly disap-
pointed; the heating, plumbing. and
electrical facilities are all in need of
rebuilding." suid l-lartlcy. “but we'll
keep the project open and 1 hope
that time comes that we can make
the downtown space usable. Ad-
ditional physical education facilities
are also needed; we presently have
about half the necessary space.“

The original overall plan for
SUNYA called for an enrollment of
25.000 students. eastern and western
podium extensions. a research
building. a field house and married
student apartments. But a fiscal
crunchin I970 caused pianstofall by
the wayside. The only present con-

struction on the SUNYA campus is
the Alumni House. it's construction
will not be affected however. since
it's funding comes from Alumni
Association.

“The administration is tnore
worried about temporary sol utions."
says Mccklcr. “their big game  tem-
porary crisis-«wait till it's a crisis
and then get moncyf‘romthc govern-
ment. This year‘s solution is the
Wellington; next year something
new. Until they usclongtcrm vision.
at least two of'thrcc. we will continue
to be hit by these problems.‘

Late Confrontation

Mccklcr wants to insure that
prospective students know about the
housing situation early and are not
confronted with the problem at the
last minute.

Among affected SUNY schools is
SUNY Buffalo where construction
of their new suburban Amherst
campus will be delayed about a year.
A spokesman from SUNYB said
that there is anxiety because the
Amherst campus. originally pro-
jcctcd for completion in 1972. will
not be finished until 1980. Stony
Brook is also hit by the moratorium.
Construction of parts of their new
Health Sciences Center. will be post-
poncd.

In a recent issue of Stony Brook‘s
student ncnspupcr. the .S'Imcmum.
Acting University President '1'. Alex-
ander l’ond was quoted us _ing
that. "it is especially unfortunate for
Long Island. where State Univer—
sity's devclpment has lagged ten
years behind the rest ofthc state. that
the moratorium catches us too far
below the capacity for provision of
higher education that has been
achieved elsewhere in the state.“

New Paltz SGA Starts
Own Daily Publication

Claim Present Paper Inadequate

by Cynthia llacinli

l‘ltc Student Government
Association (SGA) at New Paltz
State College has created a new
publication. the it"imI-Surr News. to
compete with the school's existing
newspaper. l'hcy claimed the ()rtlt'ft’
Wits not reporting enough on-
campus news.

lhc newly established Wind-Sun
Nuns was originally intended by
StiA officials to function as a house
organ for that body. According to
Editor David Levin. the paper has
become an instrument in the repor-
ting ol' campus-wide news.

Appearing daily. the ii’r‘ml-Srm
News begun publication about three
weeks ago. Its two pages were
devoted to news and a schedule of
events. Although SGA had com-
mitted itself to supplying the paper
with press released about its clubs.
none were submitted. reported
Levitt.

The staff ncvcr consisted of more
than five people at one time. who
were responsible for the gathering
and writing of news. editing. typing.
and layout ofthc pupcr. Levin says.
“We spent days and nights ptrtting
out the paper. i spent about a bun-
dred hours a week on it."

Two surveys were taken to find
out how students reacted to the
Wind- Sun Neil's-[lite first one. taken
after two days of publication. show-
ed students to be somewhat pleased
with it. though I he vast majority hrrd
not read it. The number ofcopieswas
increased from 1200 to 2000. Afew
days later. usecond survey wastaken
and the results were overwhelmingly
in favor of the newspaper. Levin
hoped that eventually the publica-
tion would grow to four pages or
‘inore.

Alter twelve issues. SGAwithdrew
funds for the paper. LoVin said.
“This was because we didn't do what

they wanted us to do. They weren‘t
pleased with the style or content-in
csscncc.its editorial policy. Their
argument for cutting our funds was
that they wanted a newsletter and we
put out a newspaper."

A presentation made by a media
review board and Wind-Sun staff
members persuaded the SGA to
restore funding to the paper. Accor-
dingto Levin. the Wind-Sun Newsis
to resume publication by the end of
this week.

Levin says that the Wind-Sun
News was valuable because it in-
stigated The Oraclcto focus more on
campus news and initiated the
organization of campus action to
work against SUNY budget cuts.
“ The Oracle wasn't doings goodjob
of communicating to students. Now
there‘s been a change in the posture
of the Oracle‘s news. In yesterday's
issue the front page is devoted entire-
ly to student news.

Levin justifies the continued ex-
istence of the Wind-Sun New: with
this statement: “A newspaper that

_comes otrt once a week can't do

anything in terms of mobilization.
With a daily source of information
on cutbacks and relevant campus
issues we can win if we organize. My
biggest aspiration is to see a daily
newspaper on a statewide level."
