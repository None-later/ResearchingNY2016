Weekend Late Buses are Running

by Mull Abrams

SUNYA students no longer have
to leave their favorite bar or a “great
party" early to catch the last bus
before 1:00 a.m. on the weekends.
Since the third week of school. Stu-
dent Association has been funding a ‘
late night has downtown on Fridays
and Saturdays. which runs from the
circle to the Hotel Wellington.

According to Rick Meckler. SA

at the Hotel Wellington at 3:00am.
Mccklcr adds that “the bus will stop
anywhere along that route if the
driver is asked. or if a student is seen
waiting for the bus."

The new weekend schedule was
originally “a seven week experiment
in which the students with an I. I). or
tax card paid 25 cents attd all others
pay 50 cents." says Meckler. “Two
weeks ago. Student Association
decided that the bus would be free
for those with a tax card.“ lloWever.
he adds that some bus drivers have
not yet aeknowlcdgedthc change in

"Solar. we're pleased withthe way
things are running." says Meckler.

Other problems include promptness

Act has acted. No longer will they
collect their data about faculty
members and courses by means of a
computer sheet that must be filled in
with pencil. Instead. iiccording to
ACT (Assessment of Courses and
Teachers) data management coor-
dinator Paul Rockwell. the evalua-
tion will be carried out using IBM
punch-out-tlie-hole cards.

The new method will be instituted
this semester in an effort to avoid
some of the problems encountered
with the past system. It is hopedthat
the IBM cards will be one step
towards more efficient compilation
of this information.

Rockwell outlined some ofthe pit-
falls of the method previously used.
“It got to be very time-consuming.
That was our biggest reason." he
said. Previously. the responses on
the sheets were run through a com-
puter and punched otit on IBM
cards. Aceording lo Rockwell. they
frequently contained incomplete
erasures. which resulted in a “double
punch“ for a single question. This in-
validated the rcsponsc. Much time
had to be spent manually checking
tItc computer sheets for these mis-
takes and making sure that the stu-
dent Ilild itot omitted the section
number at the top of lite sheet iden-
tifying the course he was evaluating.

Answer Sheet Confusion

ln addition.the iiumhcringsystcm
used on the answer sheets was con-
fusing. since all the question sheets
were nttmhcrcd horizontally. while
the spaces on the answer sheets were
numbered vertically.

'I’hesc problems

have been

eliminated with the new system. says
RockWelI. The student will answer
the questionnaire directly on anlBM
punch card. thereby removing the
extra step of transferring informa-
tion from the computer sheets tothe
cards. '

The new cards contain spaces for
all necessary information. and the
student willsimply punch outtheap—
propn’ate numbered response space.
This will facilitate easy checking of
the cards to make surethat no ques-
tion has been answered twice. Also
on the card is an error section where
the student can write in the number
of a question that has been answered
incorrectly and replace it with a new
punch.

Five Per Cent Lost

“We hope to eliminate a lot oftlie
errors that have been cropping tip“
Rockwell said. noting the impor-
tance of accuracy in the ACT. He
cited the five percent of responses
that were lost tltrottgli the old
system‘s errors.

Anotltcr important function ol'tlie
new cards is the space available for
written comments. If a student has
something to say. he or she can
pttitclt a hole in the side of the card
indicating that something has been
written. aitd then proceed to coin-
utent on the course or teacher. The
data processors will then be able to
sort all cards with written comments.
This is significant in that individual
comments on a particular class will
now be made available to students.

In the future. Rockwell hopes to
see the comments computerized so
that all a student will have to do is
type utit a class code on a computer

and all. written comments for that
class will appear instantly to be read
and evaluated. This process is only in
the planning stages now. but
Rockwell plans to make this
semester's written comments
available to students in the ACT of-
lice as soon as possible.
