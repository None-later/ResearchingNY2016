feel comfortable about their children

learning'to‘ get along with other

children while they‘re'iitudying. . It‘s

not just a babysitting service—the
' children are beneﬁtting."

Mrs. Posner adds that a unique
thing about the Center~is that “the
teachers are very poorly‘ paid for
their qualiﬁcations.“ Five ol'the six
l'ull-time teachers at at he center have
their bachelor or master degree; one
has an associate degree.

Barbara Foulks. teacher of the
t‘our-year-olds. has a master's in
curriculum instruction from
SUNYA and is certiﬁed to tench up
to sixth grade.

As she 'pushedia child on one of
the swings behind l’icrcc ilnll. she
said. “I like day care. lt‘s tiring. but
it‘s fun. I used to work at the Salva-
tion Army day care center two-antl-
a-‘hall' years. and at St. Matthew‘s.
Bo |her son \vho‘s three] has been
coming here since he was one: I‘ve
worked here sitice August.“

Uiir conversation was soon
interrupted “Barbara. Angie's
siek!" Augie was taken inside to lie
down. and his mother was called on
the phone.

Transportation Changes

In previous years. the day care
center had use ol'a SU NYA has once
a week. Now Barbara used her
Volkswagen bus to take the kids to
\isit the State museum. the police
station. the tire house. or the pet
store to buy rabbit lood.

'I he large white rabbit lives in a
playpen in thcjunior room. lor the
Iii-month to three-ycar-olds. A satid
hox. play house. toys. books. sofas.
table. cribs and cots till the room.

the three to l'iie-year~o|ds are in a
large. blue carpeted room complete
With a stage. climbing apparatus.
plants. fish. a reading corner. an art
corner. a science corner. llltte cots
are piled by the wall tor nap time.

Mrs. l’osner notes. “ Many parents
hate said we hit“: the most space ol
any other center iii the lt‘l-Cll) area.
and that we hate the correct propor-
lltitl of structure and flexibility
betiieen where they‘ie too tree and
too rigid. making kids sit down all

"I'm very laioravhly impressed. It's
nice to hear little kids."

" l he kids are crying and scream-

"l here‘s no problem at all.
lhey‘rejust there in the day."

“No one else uses the basement.
and it‘s worthwhile."

"You wouldn‘t know it was there.“

"I like to see little kids running
around. as long as they're not in my
room.”

"'l'here's Brubaehcr next door; we
can have activities there it serves

But the Pierce llall Day Care

to tilt the need lor quality day care so

We asked the same question when we first
found ourselves in a position to make the world
a more livable place.

At Kodak, we started close to home. In
Rochester, New York. We cut river pollution with
one of the most efficient industrial waste water
treatment plants In the country. We cut air pollu-
tion with scrubbers. adsorbers and electrostatic
precipitalors. We helped set up a black enter-
prise program in downtown Rochester.

Why? Helping to combat water pollution not
only benefits society but us as well as we need
clean water to make film. Our combustible waste
disposal facility not only reduces air pollution
but also helps pay for itself in heat and steam

production and silver recovery. The black enter—
pnse program not only helps people who aren't
well off but also helps stabilize communities in
which Kodak can Work and grow.

,'",Sh0rt. it's simply good business. And
we re in business to make a profit. But in further—
Ing our business interests, we also further so-
C'elY'S interests.

Alter 3”. our business depends on society.
So we care what happens to it.
