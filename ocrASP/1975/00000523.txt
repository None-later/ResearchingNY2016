by Artth llldalgo

There is at the present time an amendment
pending ratification by New York State voters
on November 4. that would extend to women
in this state equal rights. equal opportunities.
and equal responsibilities under the law; and
at the same time would extend certain benefits
to men. that only women now receive. Many
people argue that women “have it made“ and
that if ratified the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) would only destroy the institutions of
marriage and motherhood. It is interestingto
note. however. that these were the same
arguments used against the constitutional
amendment that gave women the right to vote.

Most of the arguments against the ERA
attempt to prey on one‘s emotions. But
because of the importance of the issue. it is
necessary to examine the amendment itself in
order to ascertain the reasons behind it. and to
see what it will in effect do or not do.

What will the ERA mean for the status of
women? Though the amendment is stated in
general terms. boiled down. it means that it
will be unconstitutional to retain laws that
treat men and women differently on the basis
of sex. It would be a constitutional impetus to
end sex discrimination. It seems to be clear
that without the amendment. all of the
progressive things that have happened over
the last few years will be setback. In general.
when you have a constitutional
amendmenmhe rights of the people are not
left to the disposition of the times or to the
whim of the legislature.

The passage of the State ERA would bring
numerous benefits to women. It would end
discriminatory practices in child custody.jury
selection. establishment oflegal domicile and
prison sentences. But its ramifications don't
end there. The amendment would provide
equal pension benefits; strengthen laws
against sex discrimination; and provide a

strong. solid base for specific fights already
under way for such things as job equality.

As it is now. women. especially married
women. have very few rights. It is practically
Impossible for a woman to get credit on her
own. She must either give her spouse‘s credit
rating or that of another male‘s.

The amendment is not solely aimed at rais-
ing the status of women. but would also
benefit men. Firstly. it would make it easier for

 

men to receive alimonyfrom former wives.
while the obligation of child support Would be
based on a person‘s financial ability to con-
tribute rather than on sex. Secondly, it would
equalize widows‘ insurance and pension
benefits and thus be more readily available to
mentwhereas before they were not “entitled”
to receive anything.)

The principal arguments against the Equal
Rights Amendment. led by“0peration Wake-
Up“ are: l. the ERA would abolish many legal
safeguards that in the past have established
and protected the women‘s place in the home.
2. it would subject women to the draft. 3.

abolish rape laws. and 4. open public.

restrooms to both sexes. The amendment.
these opponents say. would destroy needed
distinctions between the two sexes.

The ERA is not aimed at driving women out
of'the house as is beingsaid. It's purpose is not
to get housewives to work and contribute
equal amounts of money to a marriage. How
people finance their households is up tothem.

None of the scare tactics used by opposition
groups are logically valid. Fifteen other states
have instituted equal rights amendments and
public bathrooms have not become unisex.
Funher. the argument that women will be
drafted simply isn‘t correct. because New
York State has nothing to do with the draft.

The passage oftbe New York State amend-
ment is of vital importance. The national im-
pact that such a victory would have would be a
big help in getting the Federal ERA moving
again in the several states where it is stalled
and bef'oresome states actually start to rescind
their approval of it. A keyimportance stressed
by groups backingthe ERA—New York Civil
Liberties Union. League of Women Voters.
the State AFL-Cl0.ﬂis its immediacy. Un-
like the Federal ERA which takes effect two
years after ratification. the State ERA would
go into effect on the first day of I976. Sandra

l'urner. who heads the “New York Coalition
for Equal Rights.“ puts it this way. "It is sym-
bolically fitting that on the zoom anniversary
of the founding of a democracy dedicated to
equality. that women should finally get
theirs."

The Equal Rights Amendment will be the
liberator of all injustices. such as those said
above. which have prevailed for so many
years. It will especially eliminate those in-
justices that havc been tiimedand used against
women. The ERA is a very important issue. It
corrects inequalities for both sexes in the con-
stitution. The Equal Rights Amendment is not
just for one group of people. but would benefit
everyone: men. women. and children alike.

The Equal Rights Amendment is on trial.
The evidence is sifting in slowly from that
handful of states that have passed an ERA of
their own. and New Yorkers had better pay
heed to that evidence before they vote on
November 4th. ~

In Maryland. at the first legislative session
following passage of the state ERA. 83 laws
were introduced directly connected with the
amendment. These included a bill to make a
wife liable for her husband‘s debts. not exemp—
ting her if she had been deserted or had
childrentosupport: a bill to eliminatethe right
of female prisoners to have separate facilities
in county jails. correctional or dctentional
houses. A bill was introduced to eliminate
preferential life insurance rates for women.
and bills to repeal protective labor legislation
and to cqualile compulsory work laws.

In Colorado the law has been changed.
making a wife equally financially responsible
for the support ofcltildren. 'l‘hclegttlixation of

homosexual marriages was mandated by the
ERA and there have been several such
marriages to date in Colorado.

In California a woman security guard takes
male prisoners to and from the showers. Also
in California. women hired by the fire depart-
ment were sleeping in the same quarters with
the men. Perhaps the men didn't object. but
their wives certainly did! The “ pros“ are telling
you ERA will not invade your right to privacy.

lhe proponents of ERA deny that any such
outrages will be forced upon the American
people. btit hard facts indicate that they most
assuredly will. And rest assured. this is only
the tip of the iceberg. With only it few states

No More Giggling

Student Association is introuble. Faculty members laugh wheretheyused to giggle.
internal relations and those with outside groups are poor. administrators have no
conﬁdence in SA andstudents have little respect for it.

The problems are neither new nor peculiar to SA. but they haven't been this bad in
recent history.

The power play to take over the Faculty-Student Association (FSA) Membership
Board. a move likely to be overturned by SUNY Central. reversed the attitudes of
friendly faculty and administrators towards SA. The heavy-handed tactics used there.
and those used to convince President Fields to convert Mohawk Tower to dormitory
space. did more to reduce than to increase student power. Very often SA does not
realize when they are on the same side as the administration.

Central Council. the legislative branch. fears its own disintegration. Council
Chairperson Druid Coyne. while potentially one of the most effective. leaders in its
history. clttitns continual frustration. Council has discussed its irrelevance and its
direction. "Are we here for ‘politics‘ or 'programming‘?" they ask. as if the two were
contradictory.

Council members tnust recognize when they are engaged in useless activity. They say
the some things many times and spend hours discussing issues unrelated to the bill in
front of them. The inexperience of most Council members with SA and with formal
meeting is understandable. but it is clear that the survival of Council depends onless
tolerance of irrelevant banter. They even talk of dissolving Council. But leaving
control in tire hands of the SA Executive Branch would be a more tragic mistake.

It is not that the Executive Branch has been it complete failure. Surely Controller
Stuart Klein is straightening out SA finances. He is enforcing Council's Finance Policy
and doing the honest. accurate and respectable job that is usually expected only of
520.000—pcr-yctir accountants. Because of Klein SA may finally do well with its
auditors. Vice President Rick Mecklcr. in his role as a glorified Council member. has
worked on it number of useful projects such as late-night buses and student discounts at
some stores. Btit Battman gives Mecklcr little real responsibility. Instead. hetakestoo
rnttch himself.

There is tension in the Executive Branch cause by lack of tact in both internal and
external affairs and lack of confidence in other SA officials. The office still lacks a
Communications Director and most of the Executive Branch Budget Committee

resigned two weeks ago. causing it to fall way behind schedule. Even SA‘s student
assistants rind secretaries tnock the Executive Branch officials behind their backs.
Btititrian and Mecklcr have let their egos become deeply involved in their work. and this
has often colored theirjudgmcnt.

With most segments oftbe university

reorient itself and regain respect. it is not providing the service or representation it is
supposed to. As most problems result primarily front the ineffectiveness of the
executives. their resignations may be enough (Meckler has already threatened).
