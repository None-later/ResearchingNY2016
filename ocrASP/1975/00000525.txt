of the sixties.

by David Edelsteln

Through his use of several instruments and
experimentation with visual and body
rhythms. Jon Gibson provided sufficient
variety to offset the initial frustration I felt
whenlisteningto his musicina concert he gave
last Wednesday afternoon in the Recital Hall.
Gibson‘s performance. sponsored by the
SUNYA Free Music Store. a division of
Musicouncil. included six works he has
written for solo soprano and alto saxophones.
flute. and piano.

Jon Gibson. a native Californian. is an ac-
tive composer and performer in New York
City. He has performed throughout the
western world with many musicians. including
Steve Reich and Phil Glass. and groups such
asthe New Music Ensemble at the University
of California.

1 However. like many modern music com-
positions. Gibson‘s pieces are composed upon
a foundation of strict structural procedures
and are difficult to follow aurally. Moreover.
Gibson‘s music startlcs the car by its sudden

and abrupt endings. In “32/ II" for soprano
saxophone he repeated 32 times an H note
cliordal system around a 32 whole tone
melodic sequence. Once this repetition was
done. the piece was simply and suddenly over.

Despite the complexities his pieces pose to
the car. an o\erall quality of unity is evident
through his use of repetition and continuous
rhythms. llc expands melodic fragments
through the accttniulation oraddition oftones
as the piece progresses. Usually Gibson adds
new material simply by instinct. as in “un-
titled“ for alto flute. None of the material is
dropped. once added. and there is a gradual
building of a logical framework with a set sc—
querice of pitches.

It is interesting that Gibson combines
logical sequences and continuity with an ex-
pressivc qtitility. In "Melody l" for piano.

Tom Paxton returned to Saratoga Springs on
October 29. and performed his music before a sellout
-crowd. Saratoga Springs was the sight of one of
Paxton‘s first gigs back in the early sixties. He was
received well by the audience in the Great Saratoga
Music Hall. and his performance reflected his
appreciation for the people that attended. '
Paxton arrived in the U.S. earlier this year. after a
three year residency in London. Since then he has made
appearancesthroughout the country. i’axton‘s height of
popularity came during thesixtics. His folk songs were
part of the “protest movement" during that era.

'l‘oni played for about two hours. mixing some new!
songs with old favorites written throughout his fifteen
year career. Oti many of his old songs such as “Ramblin
Boy“. “Whose Garden Was This". and “The Last Thing
On My Mind" (which has been recorded by Neil
Diamond. .lose Feliciano. and Peter, Paul and Mary).
the audience provided good back up vocals on the

His words reach outa‘nd touch the hearts‘of many _
sensitive young Americans. This was evident in his?
songs about Watergate. Attica. and amnesty. so
were comical but he got his point across.

Paxton realizes the times have changed. and less
people are involved in hismovement. To combat this
prevalent apathy. he did a satirical song about Capital
Punishment called “Bring back the Chair".

“Zap someone there medium rare
Let‘s bring back the chair

     

As the juice sizzles thru ‘em

Howard Cosell can interview ‘em

Let's bring back the chair”

Some may think artists like Tom Paxton are of a
dying breed. 'l‘hcyjust might be. However. Tom Paxton
has had something to say for fifteen years, and he will
persist as long as he keepsthefaithAnd forthose people
who caught the spark and dedication of Tom Paxton. I

don't feel that faith will ever die.

Avant-Garde Rhythm Studies

progresses to achieve this expressive effect.

In addition to performing on four different
instruments. Gibson added variety by jux-
taposing a tape of his music for electric organ
with drawings or grids of black shapes on a
white background. As he explained in a
lecture-demonstration on Thursday after-
noon. the slidcs are drawings based upon map—
ping out the contours of many concurrent
melodies in the organ music.

While he experimented by linkingthe visual
element with the aural. Gibson also in-
vestigated the nature of body rhythmsthrough
his "Rhythm Study for Voice. Hands. and
Feet.“ As he explained more fully on Thurs-
day. the study is an exercise in body co-
ordination and deals with the interchange ofa
rhythmic unit in six beats and its subdivisions
(three. two. one beatts)) between the voice.
hands and feel of the performance. For in-
stance. in one series there are handclaps for
each ofthe six beats with vocalizing on two of
the six (on the first and fourth beats) and
stomping on three ofthe beats (the first. third

and filth.) Each particular unit or module of
six contains arty number of patterns f'orthese
three parts of the body.

As Gibson‘s exercise requires that the per-
former move l'rom one rhythmic relationship
to the next without stopping. his music. which
contains few rests. often forces musicians to
play continuously without breaks. This style
of playing is difficult for a woodwind player
with a limited supply of air.

In his "Song I“ for soprano saxophone.
Gibson uses a technique called circular
breathing. Basically. the player puffs out his
cheeks while breathing through his nose in
order to sustain sound. Gibson picked up this
technique from musicians such as Roland'
Kirk and saxophonists in the Duke Ellington
band. Although such playing would seem able
to produce only one tone color.Gibsonis able
to get various timbres through distorting his
cmbouchure. or position of the lips.

Overall. the concert was entertainineg
diverse as well as representative of many
prcl'ormances ofmodern music. Now. indeed.
I look forward to going tothe next in the series
of modern music recitals Free Music Store will
sponsor this year.

Phoenix is the new album front a
group noted for its live shows.
Featuring wild costumes and loiid
tnusic. their shows tend to excite
people. On album. though. they‘re
toned down and there is no visqu
show.

Labelle has been around forawhilc
as a vocal group, but they have only
just risen to popularity with “Lady
Marmalade.“ This cut was popular
with the disco crowd and Labellc has
that reputation of ti disco group
along with their live reputation.
When you think of Labelle. youtend
tothink ofdisco music. Actually. the
rest of the group's music, at least on
a"turns. is considerably slower.

Hancock‘s keyboard sounds are
Iiiscd \titli a funky bass and drum

confusion of sounds. On each cut he
is defin toying with a wide array of
keyboard instruments including: the
l-ender-Rliodes electric piano. the
Arp I’ro Soloist and Arp 2600 syn-
thesizers. plus the Habitat D6
clavinet. Other notable instrumen-
talists include Wayne Shorter, of
Weather Report on soprano sax and
Stevie Wonder in one cut on har-
monica.

The individual cuts vary from
repetitive high-energy funk to more
mellow. perhaps more jazz-like
creations. “Hung Up Your

with Hancock‘s riffs becomes

"Sun Touch." on the other hand.
is a mellow cut. refined through the
discreet use of the String Ensemble
Synthesizer. This is intertwined with
a flowing Fender-Rhodes lead.
accented by fine work on the Arp
Odyssey and Pro Soloist Syn-

"Heartbeat." is a different cut
altogether. incorporating emphasis
on hoodeying, Fender-Rhodes leads
