“We played poorly against Buf-

coach Bill Schieffclin. “We did not
appear to have the motivation con-
sidering the importance of the
game."

“In fact." the coach continued. “I
think that too many of our players

expected to walk onthe field'and win
Friday. They looked too far ahead-—
(to a ﬁnal against Binghamton) and
came up with a loss."

The loss to Buffalo. the Hooters

Albright Upsets Albany, 28-8

by Mike l'iekiirski

“it had been a baking contest. the
Albany State varsity football team
would have won: they had the most
turnovers.

But. unfortunately for the Danes.
it was a football game and the tur-
novers only helped the Albright
Lions walk away with a 28-8 victory
over the hosts at University Field.
Saturday.

The loss dropped the Danes‘
record to 5-2 and jeopardized their
number four ranking in the Lambert
Bowl.

The Danes‘ seven turnovers
(including six fumbles) were ex-
tremely costly. mainly because “they
came at crucial times." said Albany
head coach Robert Ford. Two ofthc
fumbles were directly responsible for
Albright touchdowns. and a blocked
punt was responsible for a third.

Not that the Lions didn't play
well~they did. But not as well asthe
score might indicate.

“They did the things they had to
do to win." siiid Ford. “When they
had to move the ball and sustain a
drive. they did. We had enough op—
port iinities and we didn‘t cash them
in."

The tone of this game was set itot

day) was good. and it was 7-0.

The third down bust uptlte middle
