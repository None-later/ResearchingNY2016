’ Women’s Studies 

Offers A Second Field .1 ' 
Helpful Towards Careers

by Lois Goldsteln

SUNYA's Women's Studies
Program has continued to grow
since its initiation in fall l97l. Star-
ting with a course in Women in
Literature. Women‘s Studies has
been offered here as a second field
since I973.

Open to both men and Women, the
Women's Studies department‘s
minor is useful for those students
planning careers in the fields ofjour—
nalism, law, education, government.
ctc.

Women‘s Studies courses have a
somewhat original approach. in that
they concentrate upon sex distinc-
tions. An over-simplified definition
of Women's Studies might be “the
study of various disciplines from the
point of view of women." Another
possible definition given by a student
of the Women‘s Studies department
is that it is “an attempt to View the
overall picture of women in the past.
present and fut urc."

According to Joan Schulz. direc-
tor of the department. there are ap-
proximately four hundred students
currently enrolled in Women's
Studies courses. This number does
include however. overlapping
students. or those involved in more
than one course in the program.

Ms. Schulz‘s reasons for the
program‘s initiation arc two-fold.
The Women‘s Studies program

serves first “to supplement and fill in
gaps in other programs which have
essentially ignored women. or not
studied women as fully as they have
men; or even worse. distorted or mis-
shaped the image and nature of
women and their activities."
Separate from its remedial features.
the department is also said to be
“valid and viable" in the more usual
academic sense.

Because of the growth in student
interest in the Women's Studies
program. plans for further expan-
sion are being considered. At this
time, interest in forming a major in
Women‘s Studies is emerging The
Women‘s Studies Committee is
utttcmpting to create a faculty-
initiated interdisciplinary program
in Women‘s Studies as well.

In the spring semester of 1975.
twelvc courses were offered, besides
courses on women offered by other
departments such as the French and
Sociology departments. Despite
men being welcome to enroll inthesc
courses. their registration has been
grossly disproportionate. Ms.
Schulz feels that the reason forthis is
lack of interest on the part of
SUNYA‘s male population. Further
information on Women‘s Studies
can he obtained by either speakingto
Ms. Schulz or looking up the
available courses in the
Umlurgrmlualt' Bulletin.

CAFE Grievance Role Confirmed '

by Sunn Miller

The only bill considered at the
Novem ber Jmeeting ofthe Universi-
ty Senate was 197576-02 which
amends the charge of the Council on
Academic Freedom and Ethics
(CAFE)to allow itto hearand act on
grievances.

This bill was introduced by the
Executive Committee not to change
the function of CAFE but to
legitimatize its present activity in this
area.

CAFE Amended

The bill as adopted reads: I. That
the charge of the Council on
Academic Freedom and Ethics be
amended by the addition of a section
8.5 to read as follows: The Council
shall bear. investigate. and make
recommendations concerning com-
plaints brought by any member of
the University community against
any other. member of the University

community provided that such com-
plaints: 1. concern profeltionll
behaviour deemed to be in deroga-
tion of professional responsibility
and privilege; 2. are not gricvable un~
der existing contracts; and 3. no

. other means of resolving the com-

plaint arc availiblc under existing
University governance at the time
the complaint is filed.

ll. That this bill take effect im-
mediately. This ammendment to the
charge of CAFE was brought up at
this time in reaction to a case last spr-
ing in which one of the parties in u
greivance before the Council
threatened to sue members of CAFE
because they were performing a
function outside of the bounds of
their charge.

The final clause of 8. 5.3 “Under
existing University governance at
the time the complaint was filed."
was added to prevent the establish-

ment of ad hoc committees by par-
ties who would fecl it desirable to
bypass CAFE. I

Posltlon 0n Ethnic Sludln.

In other business the Council On
Educational Policy reported that its
committee on program evaluation
was preparing position papers on the
place of ethnic studies at SUNYA
and on undergraduate distribution
requirements. Committees of the
Undergraduate Academic Council
are studying the issues of grading.
dean‘s list. and honors graduation. It
is also preparing a bill that would
allow professors to terminate the
registration of students in their
courses.

A special meeting of the Senate
will be held on Monday December I
at 3:00 pm in the Assembly Hall. At
the time Dean Sirotkin will report to

'the Senate on Academic priorities

and 'resource allocation.
