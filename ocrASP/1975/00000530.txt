toward‘the other extreme of

national results: they felt the same on
most issues ai the nation's students
in general, but in significantly larger
proportion.

The following are some survey
results on the moral and political at-
titudes of college students in general,

and at Oklahoma Christian College

and an Ivy League school:

—54% of all college students
favored the decriminalization of
marijuana, while 68% of the Ivy
League students favored it. OCC
students opposed the measure by

a.

—Only "5% of the nation'scollege
students and 9% of the ivy League
students felt that premarital sex was
wrong. while 83% of the OCC
students were against pre-marital
sex.
—65% of all college stu.
dents and 83% ofthc Ivy League
students supponed the right ofabor-
tion under all circumstances. Only
24% of the OCC students took that
stand.

The survey indicated that most
college students held a “strong anti-
business" attitude. But. accordingto
Gallup. this hostility is accompanied
by a “shocking” ignorance ofthe free
enterprise system. Gallup asserts
that most students have a “distorted”
view of big business. over-estimating
proﬁts and under-estimating cor-
porate takes. ~

“Whydostudentsturntotheleft?“
asked Gallup in a summary ofthe
survey's findings. He answered his
own question by citing events ofthe
recent past such as Vietnam.
Watergate. and the economy— but
emphasized the “great influence“ of
professors with leftist views.

Probing student religious at-
titudes. the survey showed that most
students across the country believe
in “God or a universal spirit.“ and
that 65% of the students believe in
lifeafter death—thoughthestatistics
drew no distinction between reincar-
nation and traditional salvation.

_Campbell. who calls himself sort
of a dog psychiatrist, says that the
most common complaints of his
mental patients. the German
Shepherds, the St. Bernards andthe
Fox Terriers and eventhe Poodles, is
that “My master doesn't understand
me."

Campbell says he sees all sorts of
dog problems. such as common
house soiling and chewing, ner-
vousness. lack of self esteem and
even obesity. Campbell says that
some of the problems are brought on
by the canine “work ethic" or by a
natural tendency of a dog toimitate
his master.

Campbell explains that since dogs
no longer have to ﬁnd food. shelter
and a place to sleep, they make up
their own work. such as tearing up
pillows.

Campbell says that daily chores
such as chasing a ball or fetching a
newspaper can “give a dog a sense of
fulfillment.“

ANTI-ACID

The Director of Operations of a
Northern California water agency
reports that most water companies

across the United States have devis-
ed secret contingency plans to
decontaminate their water if it
happens to be spiked with LSD.-

Gordon Laverty of the East Bay
Municipal Utility District says that
his agency secretly developed its own
anti-LSD operation in the late
1960’s.

Laverty says that water district
ﬁeld agents have been instructed on
how to quickly test for
hallucinogenic chemicals in water
supplies. He says the plansinclude
emergency flushing of the entire
system and for loudspeaker cars to
travel through city streets broad-
casting warnings.

Laverty reports that the plans
Were hatched after radical hippie-
types threatened to spike the water
with “acid” duringthe Vietnam War.
He adds that water agency operators
aroundthecountrycontinuallyswap
contingency plan ideas during their
national conventions.

OPERA ON THE HILL

A freshman member of Congress
reports there is a lot more drama go-
ing on in the halls of the Capitol
Building than most voters hear
about.

Democrat Toby Moffett of Con-
necticut says that the drama he's
talking about is not the real-life im-
portant kind. Moffett explains:
“Every day you can go into the
Democratic cloakroom, and maybe
the Republican cloakroom too. and
they (members of Congress) will be
sitting glassy-eyed watching ‘Scarch
A A A A A A'A A A A

ForTomorrow’ or ‘Aa The World
Turns? "

Moffett says that soap opera view-
ing and other similar activities are
common in Congress. adding that if
a private company did the same
thing. it would quickly go out of
business.

HERE’S DICKY

Are you ready for Richard M.
Nixon. weekly broadcast commen-
tator? .

The same firm which currently
syndicates Ronald Reagan's
nationwide radio shows reports it is
negotiating for a similar show hosted
by former President Nixon.

Harry O‘Connor of O‘Connor
Creative Services says that he has
talked with Nixon about a regular
radio or T.V. show, beginning
possibly next year.

O'Connor says that Nixon prefers
radio over T.V. because radio
“Didn't have the element that people
would be turned off by the kind of
necktie he was wearing.“

I.D. PLEASE
The Washinglon Star reports that
H million persons who live in the

,t. ,'

United States may soon be required
by the Federal Government to carry
special government-issued iden-
tification cards. ‘

The newspaper says that the ﬁrst
two groups expected to be required
to carry the national I.D. cards at all
times are five million aliens living in
the US. and six million head of
households eligible to receive food
stamps.

The Star says that Congress has
already approved $4.7 million for
the alien ID. cards; and that a
registration plan for food stamp
recipients. requiring photo ID.
cards. is currently working its way
through Congress.

Many civil libertarians are op-
posed to the issuance of national
ID. cards, arguing that it is the
beginning of a totalitarian state.
However. Francis Knight. the direc-
tor of the US Passport Office. has
publicly predicted that most
Americans will support a nation-
wide I. D. system so that each person
can prove who he or she is.

SECURITY INDEX

The FBI has apparently not
destroyed its so—ealled “security in-
dex" of over 15,000 individuals who
for over thirty years were targeted to
be picked up and detained in the
event of a national emergency.

The New York Times quotes
sources familiar with the inside
workings of the bureau as saying
that many of the names of those
slated to be detained have never been
destroyed. The 'Iimes report directly

Americans who were considered a 
possible security threat expired in

Last week. in a letter to the House
Civil Liberties Subcommittee.
Clarence Kelley assured Chairman
Robert Kastenmeier that the
securities index had been destroyed
in l97l.

The New York Times quotes its
sources. however. as sayingthat the
list of over [5.000 individuals was
merely transferred to another file.
and was not destroyed.

Kelley also admitted in the same
letter that the FBI continued to
maintain a list of at least l200 per-
sons who were considered security
risks. Kelley insisted. however. that
this list was merely an “ad-
ministrative aid“ to help the bureau
identify persons who might be a
potential threat to the President.

Chairman Kastenmeier has
demanded an investigation into why _
the “security index“ was kept even
after Congress had ordered it
dﬁtroyﬂ.
