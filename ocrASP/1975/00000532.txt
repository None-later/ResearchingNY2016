by Don Sperling

Stephen Stills brought his band
into Albany Tuesday. and per-
formed a near three hour concert at
the Palace Theatre. The concert was
a bit uneven. mixing some of his old
country rock tunes with some loud
heavy rock. However. most of the
songs were played well cnotigh to
satisfy the audience.

The first set was an electric one.
The hand opened up with “ Lovcthe
Onc You‘re With“. Though a great
song, it was a bit sluggish. it lacked
the tightness which dcvelopcd as the
concert moved along. To end this
short first set. the hand did a tremen-
dous version of “Wooden ships.“

Stills was playing the breaks
fast and smooth. The bass supplied
the backbone to tltc song with
George "Chocolate" Perry really hit-
ting thosc notcs. liven lead gtiitarist
Donnie Ductis. who played incon-
sistentiully till evening. smoked his
way through some good guitar rill's.

llic Band exited the stage and lclt
Stills iiloiic With his acoustic guitars.
Stephen sat oii ll stool with a guitar
in hand and began . with a beautiliil
version 01 “Chungc Partners.“ iic
played a long set by house”. and won
his audience‘s appreciation song
alter song. This was the best segment
of the coiiccri.

Stills Wits at his best. “sittin hack
and rockiii gently.“ He performed

such songs as “Blackbird”.

“Everybody‘s Talking“ (Midnight
Cowboy). “Crossroads”. and believe
it or not. an acoustic version of

"Redhousc" by Jimi Hendrix. When '

i asked Stills about this be com-
mented “I guess if 1 did it electric it
might have come off it little more
real. but no one could follow Hen-
drix around and doit like he does.“
However. by this time Stills had
gone through so many beautiful
songs that it came off incredibly
rcl‘incd.

The band continued some rock n
roll. including a rendition 01' “Turn
Back the Pages." However. a few of
the songs in the latter part of the
show were loud nitd disturbing. One
song (i didn‘t catch the name) was
just a montage of heavy. rauchy
guitars. 1t resembled some oi .limniy
Page’s noise and was entirely iin-
called lor. It was too inconsistent
with the rest of the music. On many
of these songs. Donnie Ductis played
lead guitar. He mixed some nice
sliding and rill's with some annoying
ciir piercing sounds.

Relaxed in his dressing room. sip-
pinga clip of beer. Stills related sortie
of his feelings onllie music he played
during I he night. and what he used to
play. “1 want ito expand l‘ni iiiitcli
too versatile to be playing one brand
of music." When i asked about the
hard rock he played. lic simply said.
“1 love to play lead guitar man! 1
ticcd another dircctiontolookitito. i
feel tlllcl’ a while that some of the
country rock music is pussy sliit.“ He
went on further and said "Some of
these country rock groups take
things too serious. They are so into
tile ‘1 am beautiful country

'singcr‘ image. He cited Jackson

 
   

Browne and the Burrito Brothers as
an example. Hcihcn added “It‘s get-
ting to the point where it ain‘t even
country music no more." He paused.
relaxed. and said "Yeah. I could do
some real country. lcouldn‘t Con-
tinue with that country rock musi-
cian image. l‘m too black. and have
too much liitin in me.“

But Stills admits that he could not
go the limit like some groups. Hestill
has too many roots in those light
punchy melodies he did with
CSNY and Buffalo Springfield back
in the sixties.

When 1 asked Stephen about the
music out these days. he had several
rcplics.“l think 11 lot oi'bzinds pull off
shit. l'akc Bad Company. They have
some dynamite songs on their
albums. but all they do on stage is
_ll\'t.' l kccp listening. but I can't
hear no music. 'l'hcy wouldn't pull
that shit off over in linglniid. oiily
licrc.."

Stills was a little bittci' when we
discussed the press he gets from cer-
tain writers. "We (CSN Y) were the
first ones to do those stadium con-
certs a few years back. We knocked
ilicm oiit ilil over the place. and we
got four paragraphs of print. 11‘s I Iiat
luck Jon 1 tindtiu front Rolling
Slolu' and his writer friends around
the country. Where does he get off
putting people down like me. .loni
Mitchell and others." He coin-
niciucd on London‘s selling of Bruce
Springsteen. who let Landau
manage him when things were get-
ting rough. "I don‘t feel that Springs-
teen. or anyone should how to live

innit- [im ii-ai‘tsned his ‘
made.  When I see Spring- '

teen. he.._lietter be on fire. No one

should have-toil): pu‘t tindér- such 5" '

great measure. l‘ni just me. and ['39

some of the people he played with.
like Eric Clapton. “We never cut a‘
record or played in front of an
audience on stage. but wejammed a
lot together." Dallas Taylor and
Fuzzy Samuels also played with
Stills and Clapton. “Out styles eon-
tlicicd. me and Eric. It affected me
too much. which affected Dallas and
Hilly. It's one oi'those things where
you‘re hot for a while. and you feel it
liowing. but then something halts

out there and do-my shit aslfeel." 7V
I asked Sieve about oldtimes.and '

  

“They. put the guy on

-rescrve‘ for the season. so _l d ' he 7

  
   

samewiththcshirt."Aaliyahleaving“J  . .

he said “i want you to thank all the
people up at the school for lettingmc
play some squash in the gym. Man. I
was tired as hell.“ I suggestedthat he
try some four wall paddleball.“Yeah.
maybe next time around.“ Con-
sidering the talent and dedication of
Stephen Stills. I'm hoping for a few
more "next timearou‘nds.“
