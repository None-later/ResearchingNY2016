IGlittcring eyes ﬂash the face.

Make a point and leave no trace.
Bodies fall 7 '
Strangers call

Darkness. hallowed.

Academia nnw the witches‘ dcn
Objects moved—and not by men
Wasted timc ‘

Bizarre is Sacred.

Twisted ﬁgures clash with pillars
Some are dying, some are killers.

Freedom lost and found.

Fakirs tell of truthl'ul stories

OI~ changing tunes. of older glories.
Cloths unruch

Backward travel

New lil‘c for Hullowc’cn.
