society the Watergate affair has

In modern democratic societies
government officials must also ex-

becomes. in effect. another means of
keeping ofﬁcials in line. The ancient
Athenians prided themselves in
parrhesia. something akin to our
concept of free speech. In the fifth
century BC. Athenian comic poets
regularly used their plays to make
fun of leading politicans.
Aristophanes frequently attacked
Cleon. a general and politician dur-
ing the earlier years of the
Peloponnesian War. (Among his
other victims were leading intellec-
tuals such as Euripides and
Socrates.)

half of this epithet refers to Pericles‘

these attitudes. Two carefully screened contestants
compete for. as Don says. “a chance to work in a major
motion picture in the hope of being discovered and
going for that one-in-a-million longshot. acareer in the
movies." The contestants recreate a scene from a classic
movie “with a big guest star" and are then judged by a
famous director as to who is the more promising actor
or actress. “Big stars“ who have appeared on the show
are such immortals as Martin Milner. Loretta Swit.
Lyle Waggoner. Robert Conrad and Greg Morris.
The contestants are dehumaniled from start to finish.
Before they begin their screen test. Don Adams
sagaciously says. in one sardonic breath. “The judges
will be watching but don't be nervous :indjust relax.“
the contestant and the big star both view the scene they
are about to act out. Then they are whisked away and

Davc Mason was one of the

group's first hit.“Holcin My Shoe."
After several hassles involving con-
flicts of interests. Mason left tltc

it was difficult. for Mason (or
anyone) to maintain the high quali-
ty. 0n the succeeding albums. dueto
this problem. Mason found himself
redoing his own songs. It isn‘t‘that
Mason wasn‘t expanding. or at least
trying to expand. his capabilities. it
was just that he found himself locked
into an almost set mold.

ln I973. Mason‘s career took a
sharp turn for the better. He switch-
cd his recording company from Blue
'l'humb Records to CBS Records.
And. with the aid of friends such as
Graham Nash and David Crosby ac-

struments and vocals. Mason releas-

Probably the main rcnson for
Dave Mason‘s upward success is the
group's second guitarist. Jim

closely together to produce a tight
sound that shows through in both
concerts and recordings.
