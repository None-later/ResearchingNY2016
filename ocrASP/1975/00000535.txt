if the wine has no noticeable sweetness it is t,

Astringency is caused primarily by tannic
compounds, which are natural components of
grapes. Like acid, astringency is necessary to a
moderate degree. lest the wine taste insipid.
Excessive bitterness usually shows up most
prominently in the finish.

Acid, tannin and sugar are about all your
taste buds 'can distinguish by themselves.

flavors as they fade away. for some
characteristics of the wine may be revealed
only in what is termedthe ﬁnish —r'.e., the sen-
sations that occur after the wine has been
swallowed.

As in the nose, we seek in the taste aclean,
vinous quality appropriate to the occasion.
We may also find suggestions of fruit, spice or
other pleasant ﬂavors. Some Ruby Cabernet,
for example, will show hints of green olive;
other wines from the same grape may suggest a
eucalyptus grove.

Putting the wine in your mouth also reveals
certain characteristics apart from flavor. The
most important are total acidity (tartness).

This column concludes our discussion of

basic tasting technique with an actual taste of '
the wine. ,

After giving your nose a few moments to
recover from the nose of the wine (1.2.. thesum
of the aromas and bouquet). take enough
wine to taste—about an ounce—into your
mouth. Don't swallow it yet.

First roll the wine around to make sure it
touches all parts of the tongue. Next, holding
the wine on your palate, open your lips very
slightly in a somewhat puckered shape and.
breathing through the mouth, take a deep
breath. It‘s rather like whistling backwards.
As you breathe in. press your tongue upward
