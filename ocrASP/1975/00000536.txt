To the ﬂier: . y

We would like to respond to Michael
[issuer's letter in lTuesday’sAsp(Nov.4)
in which he condemns SA for not meningitis
personal needs. We hope that .Mr. Lissner
does not honestly expect SA ofﬁcials to do
what he is suggesting Besides the fact that on-
campus students do not constitute the entire
student population. the purpose of having
Central Council representatives is to receive
student input into SA activities. In addition.
the SA ofﬁce is opento all students from 9—5.

ﬁve days per week. There is a Central Council"

meeting every Wednesday night in which all
students may speak. There are many com—
mittees whose membership is open to all
students and SA is willingto help organize airy
new committees to meet student needs. We
hope that concerned students like Mr. Lissner
will follow these suggestions in order to help
Student Association fulﬁll student needs.

The Other Side

To the Editor:

After reading the latest issues of the ASP.
we began to question the objectivity of this im-
portant mean in representing the viewpoints
of the whole student body. with their diverse
beliefs and nationalities. Although we bitterly
recognize that any majority has more
privileges and thus more effectiveness. we still
don‘t want to see the ASP.dominatcd by one
group.

By reviewing almost the whole issues of the
ASP. it is rare not to ﬁnd in each one. more
than one article condemning the Arabs and
praising the Jews and the Jewish sttttc. And
because the community at SUNY is not ex—
posed totthc other side ofthe story. we believe
that they are the victims of one point of view.
The fault lies partly on us. Arab students at
SUN Y. but mainly because we are greatly out-
numbered.

What we‘d liketoseethe members ofthis in-
stitution doing. is to question always the
validity of what they read and to ask
themselves. “Is this really true?" and "What
might be the other point of view?" For as in-
tellectuals. this is the way we must approach
any issue and find the facts by ourselves.

Commenting on some articles. we have read
repeatedly in theASP. we ﬁndthe Jews always
complaining that they are supresscd and mis-
treated by the whole world. This reminds us of
a story which tells us about a little kid who
every day used to come to his father complain-
ingthat he was hit by somebody. Atthe begin-
ning, the father was concerned and paid atten-
tion. but later he recognized the fact that
something must be wrong with the kid himself.

We think that it is about time to recognize
that this kind of policy that the Jew follow is
only to get the sympathy ofthe people,and es-
pecially the Americans. so as to achieve their
goals. such as to get more and more aid and
support to their cause.

We hope that what was written here will
throw a shed of light on the other side of the
story. and that students at SUN Y will come to
recognize that there are Arabstudenta. though
very few. but willing to explain their point of
view.

To the Eater: ‘ _

A common trait found in many civilizations
is that the exploited groups are often involved
in ﬁghting amongst themselves. rather than in
joining forces to strive to improve their situa-
tion. In the Tuesday editorial(Nov. 4). the
ASP gave proof to this theory. Instead of un-
iting with Student Association to strive for
common goals. the ASP is engaging in petty
power struggles.

All too often we are plagued by sen-
sationalized news stories of “supposed” SA
politics. Unfortunately, much of the
groundwork done within the Association,
with the cooperation of less “vocal” faculty
and staff, rarelyreceives attention bytheASP.
This tends to weaken the credibility. of the
Association.

We realize our place in the university. and
hope that theASPdoes as well. We looktothe
ASP for direction. perspective and always.

Senseless Giggles

To the Editor:

l would like to take issue with your
November 4 editorial entitled, “No More
Giggling." Much of your complaints against
Student Association make little or no sense.
and are based on little or no facts.

Your complaint of a “power play" to take
over the FSA membership board makes the
ASP sound like an administration Iackey. In
the past. the administration and faculty have
nearly always voted as a blockto push through
what they want. Have you complained of their
"power plays?“ This time. the students were
able to unite on an important issue and take a
majority on the FSA. Students generate over
90% of FSA‘s income. Does it not make
sense that we should have majority input into
the corporation?

In discussingthc Mohawktower issue ofthe
ASP again complains of “heavy handed" tac-
tics used by SA officials. ls disagreeing with
President Ficlds‘ decisiontotaketwo weeksto
make a study of the feasibility of making a
st udy of the feasibility of converting Mohawk
tower to dorm space really heavy handed'.’

'I'hc ASP even goes so far as to complain
that “Even SA‘s student assistants and
secretaries mock the Executive Branch behind
their backs." Perhaps those who work for the
ASP look up to their editors with god-like
adoration. but the people who work in the SA
office are human andthey have the capaciton
understand humor. Bttuman and Meckler are
not gods. nor do they pretend to be.

The people in Student Association work
hard. and are trying to represent the students.
in working with the administration and other
everyday tasks. I haven‘t seen any evidence
that “most segments of the university" are
“turned off by SA," as you claimed in your
editorial. Perhaps it is the ASP editorial staff
that is turned off because their requests for a
doubling oftheir stipends has been rejected by
Central Council.

SIPH
Seminar

To the Edltor:

What do you think when you seen personin
a wheelchair. with braces or crutches; a blind
person tapping along with a cane? Are they
really like you. or for that matter “like other
people"? '

IoVe to party..ra'ise  kind of hell. do

thin‘p that according to the law are illegal.

. There are also some who are Studioll. who
spend hours upon hours studying to make
. grades. so that they too canﬁtintotherat race

of the world. But they have a problem of being
accepted by other students as their peers. I
really don't know why it should be that way,
do you?
Except for the apparent physical
differences. they have the same physical. and
emotional drives as any “normal” person.
They like being a part of college life. The dorm
parties, sports tournaments(oh sure they can't
play but they sure can yell), even joining
fraternities and sororities are part of their dai-
ly lives. They like to feel that if someone has a
problem. they too can be a shoulder to cry on,
or someone you can conﬁde in. And believe it
or not. they even have the same attractions to
someone of the opposite sex. They too need
the problems and the joys of being in love.
Sure they are different in some ways, but in
most they have the same ideas and confusions
every college student has. If this makes you
think at all about the disabled. why not come
to a seminar put on by Students for the Im-
provement of Programs for the Handicapped
(SIPH)‘.l It will be held on November [0. from
1:00 to 4:00 in the CC Assembly Hall. There
will be short speakers. movies. wine and
cheese. and a panel discussion. where you can
ask anything that you would like to know.
from what they feel to what they do. So please
come and enjoy. maybe even open your mind
to people that are “like other people." .

Jews In Hiding?

To the Editor:

I am writing in reference to the response. or
more accurately the lack of it. on the part of
the Jewish students at SUNYA. Contrary to
popular. appearance.,.tbere are morgthan 40-
60 Jews here—the others arejust hiding!

As chairman ofa Jewish Students Coalition
committee, I get to wit ness first hand the total
apathetic nature of the Jews on campus—and
it sickens me.

JSC is the only Jewish st‘ (lents‘ organiza-
tion here; and many students use an un-
founded “dislike” for the organization andthe
people in it as an excuseto avoid any Jewish
activities at SUNYA.

The argument that JSC is n "clique". or that
people are unfriendly is not only a cheap cop—
out. but unadulterated bullshit as well. If the
behavior of a small group of people is enough
to deter your pursuit of a goal. or anidea. then
yottrdesirc was obviously negligible in the first
place. Just think back on all the times you
avoided (that's the word lor it!) JSC functions.
and note what you did instead.

ldi Amin came to the United Nations and
called for an end to ALL JEWSHJSC
members. and Non members. How many of
you took exception to what he said? How
many of you knew that he had said it'.’ Or did
you think he meant some other Jewsw~likc
your Grandparents in Europe did when Hitler
said the very same thing? And if you think the
comparison in inaccurate. you‘re mistaken.
.)nc need not be an alarmist or fanatic to know
who he is and where he belongs.

lftbcre isn't another warin Israel until I999.
will youforget about her until then? If wars are
the only incentive to bring you out of hiding.
how about sturtinga fcw'l How about a war on
behalf of the Jewish poor, a war against the
oppression of Soviet Jewry. or a war on anti-
semitism'!

A committmcnt to Judaism cannot be
bought. Paying offthe UJA. ASA. BBO. or
JSC will not relieve you of your respon-
sibilities. Joining JSC and never attending an
event is not doing your share for Judaism.

You're committing the very crimes many of
you condemn your parents of~~insinccrity.
hyprocrisy, and materialism to name a few.

How can you be so unsure of your identity
when everyone else labels you “JEW‘”! Take
the time to find out what being a Jew is. It
doesn't hurt much. and the beer will still be
there when you get back to your dorm.

Part of being a Jew means being with other

Spain’s Eye on SA

To the Elton

- I ﬁnd it most curious that some faculty
members would consider reacting to a student
majority on the FSA Membership Board by
voting to remove students fromthe University
Senate. This information comes to me via the
most recent of the occasional ASI‘s we have
received over here.

Such reactions would reflect serious mis-
understandings on the part of the less
enlightened Faculty members. First ol'all. due
to state guidelines a student majority will be
allowed only on the Membership Board. The
Membership Board is a relatively powerless
body with nowhere near the power of the
Board of Directors of the University Senate.
The primary function of the Membership
Board is to selectthe Board of Directors under
previously mandated student/faculty/ad-
ministration ratios. The actual operations of
the FSA are determined by the Board of
Directors. which decides what endeavors FSA
will undertake. approves the budget. sets meal
contract rates. etc. So faculty members talking
of a Membership Board-Senate tradeol'f are
erroneous if they see some degree ofequality
in doing so.

Perhaps most central tothe issue is the way
students were able to attain a majority on the
Membership Board. Faculty arguments op-
posing student membership in the Senate
claim that student participation is the reason
the Senate never accomplishes anything. The
real reason. however. is that faculty Senators
attend meetings in such low numbers that a
quorum is never present. Thus. anytime a
Senator opposes a measuretltat appears likely
to pass. he/shc merely calls for a quorum.
Since a quorum is not present. the meeting is
forced to adjourn without doingathing. This
happened a number ol'times last year. It wasa
similar failure of the Faculty to attend a
Membership Board meeting that allowed the
students to vote in a student majority. When
will the Faculty finally accept responsibility
for their own actions rather than making
scapegoats of the students? How can they
clamor for an all-faculty University (lover-
ning Body when it is an absence offacultyin-
tcrcst in these matters which get them into
these predicttmcnts to begin with?

Be that as it may. I was appalled at the
arrogance displayed by S.A. Vice President
Rick Meckler. I am as aware as anyone ofthe
dangers inherent in relying on the ASI' as my
sole source of information. However. it
appears that Mcckler'sjustification of “power
politics“ to rttmthrough the votes for a student
majority withottt allowing any debate on the
issue is totallycontrury to the sense ol'fuir play
which supposedly idealisticstudent leaders are
supposed to possess. Has his position of power
as Vice President made him so haughtythat he
can‘t remember the student indignation when
the Administration tried to suppress any
debate of this very same issue only last spring’!
Perhaps this is just another case of the “it‘s
terrible if they do it. but OK if we do it" syn-
drome which we scornfully attribute to real
world politicnns. This isn't the wuyl want my
leaders of tomorrow to conduct themselves.

SU NYA’s administration projects an increase of approximately I.000 students here
between now and I980, assuming that extra funding is received. It is essential that any
effort to support programs and services by usinga high enrollment to argue for more
money not jeopordize SUNYA‘s excellent teacher-student ratio nor leave extra
students stranded in the streets of Albany. ' '

In other words. SU N YA should not play a game with SUNY Central or the state by
avoiding cuts through class crowding. The state either supports quality education or it
shouldn‘t have higher public education.

An Indiscriminant Disaster

Something is rotten in the State of I)cn-
mark (Great Danes. get it). President Ford
says that if New York City goes under.
declares bankruptcy. defaults or just plain
goes broke. it Won't affect the economy of
anybody else. Wcll thztt‘sjust not true. Forget-
ting for a minute that a goodly portion of the
student body at the University have parents
who work for New York City. forgetting that
some of us even have NYC tnutncipal bonds.
the impact of federal nontntcrvcntnm would
be crippling. to thc economon the world. the
tuition. the state, the University. private
businesses and each of us individually.

Just what does default mcan‘.’ All New York
City has to do to default is be unable to pay
one bill at one time to one individual or com-
pany. The courts then take over anti
Kablooey . , . all funds are frozen and no
bills are paid until the courts work out a
program for payment. Most likely. all those
who are owed money will be offered a percen-
tttgc of the money owed them. In sotne cases
the difference between the amount owed and
the amount paid will force individual and cor-
porate bankruptcies. In other cases. it will
merely cttusc further hard times. In anycasc. it
will further Wcttkcll people‘s faith in the
economy and therefore add to the already
depressed world wide situation. People in
both public and private business will be Ittid
off by the thousands and services will be
drastically reduced if not done away with com-
pletely.

Why this is potentially going to happen is
not all that important. The important point
here is that the allowance of a New York City
default has much broader implications titan
the punishment of the city. It will have very
serious implications for the people and
economy (beyond the govarnmcnt) of the city
itself. '

How does any ofthis affect the state and this
University? Well. for one thing. Governor
Carey has predicted that a New York City
default would bringthe state down within thir-

ty days. The (iovcrnor has cttllc
emergency session of the lcgislnture for this
coming l'ucsday. Obviously the reasons go
beyond New York City itscll.

This Stole ilscll is in the midst of a huge
financial deficit and the state has been ttnablc
to sell bonds that uscdto be a major means of
support.

It New York City goes under. and the stale
lollows as predicted. what would ltappcn to
lllts llnttctsn) 1‘ nuclear. like the city. the
state‘s debts lllltl linnncinl responsibilities
would enter the hands of the courts and the
outcome is unknown. Certainly the ttllncks in
New York City on the City University of New
York system (CU NY) concerning fret: tuttion
and open admissions are indicative of the at-
titudes towards higher education and its
public accessibility in times ol’l'inanciul crisis.

What can we do to save our school and
preserve the State‘s cotntnitt ment to providing
quality low—cost cducution‘! Student Assocut-
tion of the State University (SASU) has in-
itiated a coalition of New York "State
Students in public institutions of higher
education. which includesthe CUNY. Student
Senate. and the Community College Student
Association. SASU has passed a plan of ne-
tton calling for massive educational rallies. a
letter writing campaign and lobbying of cott-
grcsspcoplc in Washington DC.

In coordination with the SASU effort. Stu-
dent Association will be sponsoring a mass
rally and tench-in in the Campus Center
Ihtllrootn on Sunday November 9th at 7:30.
Speakers will include representatives of the
various state organizations. the (iovorner and
Lieutenant (ioverner representatives.
members of the New York State Legislature
and various campus coordinators ofthe effort.
In addition. we hope to send buses to the ac-
tivity in Washington. If you care about New
York-City. State or University. help us. help
yourself. Do something constructive With
your spare time.

The administration appears committed to having more students. If so. it must then
be committed to insuring off-campus students the quality of life essential to their
university education. Solutions such as prefabricated housing or semi-commercial
student appurtment construction would go a long way towards “alleviating the
increased crunch for living space. H"

But the administration‘s committmcnt to off-campus students. especially those not

' living at home. must include more than finding space. Money should be allocated for

more busing. There already is a need for a bus down Madison Avenue that could then
take Lark St reel to Washington Avenue. Resources should be diverted tothe Office of
Student Affairs where it can be used to expand the promising work of Acting Assistant
Dean for Student Life Sue Pierce to help the off—campus student.

The university must be acutely aware that they have responsibility for students they
have accepted but not housed. Legal advice. transportation. and other services are
already in great need. Dean Pierce is now Working with Student Association‘s Off—
Campus Association in a rare example of direct cooperation between SA and the
administration. and has set up a beginning structure for these services. They will
become increasingly important in the coming years. 3 ‘
