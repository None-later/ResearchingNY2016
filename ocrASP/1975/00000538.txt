six feet. two inches, 225 pounds. is
quick and very strong.

The Danes come into the game
stuttering from a rash of injuries.
Fullback Tom DeBlois and halfback
Orin Grifﬁn. who haven't been in
pads all week, are not expected to
play. Also doubtful is linebacker
Ken Schoen.

Fran Brunelle will be in DeBlois‘
spot and Dave DuPre will be ﬁlling
in for the ailing Grifﬁn.

Brunette. who rushed for 54 yards
last week. is atough runner. Hestays
on his feet and is very competitive.
according to Ford.

Otherwise the offense isthe same.

The Dance must get back on track

against Plattsburgh and not ordy
win. but win impressively. They
must start playing better fundamen-
tal football.

The Danes (5-2) come into Satur--

day‘s contest ranked Him in the
Lambert Bowl after last week‘s dis-
asterous loss to Albright. 28-8.

“Al bright just plain whipped us at
the basic f undnmentals.” said Ford.
“They blocked. tackled.shed blocks.
and threw and caught the ball better
than we did.“

“Against Plattsburgh we will have'

to execute better and not beat
ourselves offensively." Ford con-
tinued. “If We do these things. lam
confident we will be able to beat
Plattsburgh."

. Rangers Buried By Siena, 17.3 ’

by Ken Kurt:

The Albany Rugby Club was
defeated by cross town rival Siena
College l7-3 Saturday. The Ruggers
also dropped the B game. 4—0.

The game was played under very
windy weather conditions. but
Albany managed and early 3-0 lead
via a thirty yard fredthirty yard field
goal by Eliot Sulsky. Albanyenjoyed
good ﬁeld position for the entire
.half. but couldn't put the ball in the
end zone. Five seconds before the
end of the half. Siena pushcdthc ball

' over for a 4—3 lead.

Albany hadto playthe second half
againstastrongwind. Early .inthe
second half. Albany was denied a
score. as the refereg ruled that Chuck
Rappalzo had not grounded the ball
in the'end zone. denying Albany is
much needed four points. This had a
marked effect on State. as it was

capitalized on their good ﬁeld posi-

tion in the second half. as each State

miscuc resulted in a Siena score.
Siena Dominates

in the second half. Siena
dominated the kicking and coverage
phases of the game. Siena got oii‘
good kicks. and covered them well.
With Albany deep in their own
territory and forced to punt. the
result was a great position for Siena,
as Albany punted poorly because of
the strong wind.

“Two factors lead to our defeat."
said Albany Coach Chuck Rapper.-
zo. “ The wind wasthe biggest fac-
tor. Our backs are more experienced
panting with the wind. and as a
result our own punitng was damag-
ing for us. Secondly. we were over-
confident going into the game. We
had beaten Siena earlier in the
season. but after they went ahead in

. ,

the second half. the team let down."

State dominated line play. win-
ning the majority of rocks and set
scrums. Wences Rodriguez. State's
l'tne scrumman. was playing a new
position. “He didn‘t have one of his
better games. as he wasn't used ot the
position. and couldn't get to the ball
as quickly as usual." said Rappaz—
20.
A few bad plays also contributed
to the State, defeat. The out of
bounds punt attempts were going
straight lathe Siena endmen. and
they would run the ball for substan-
tial gains. “Overall. it was a disap-
pointing game. as we expected to win
it and remain as the best ruby elubin
the Capital District." Rappazm
said.
