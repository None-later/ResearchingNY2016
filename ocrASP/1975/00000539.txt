'Binghontton-Hartwic‘k Games

The winner gets a bid. The loser
gets a kiss and a handshake.

its do or die when the Albany var-
sity soccer team takes the field at
Brockport Saturday. for a 2 pm.
match against the host Golden
Eagles.

Brockport faces the same dilem-
ma. withthe added slapintheface of
possibly hosting the national ﬁnals
only as observers.

 

“There is no doubt "about it. Awin
means in.“ said Albany varsity
soccer coach Bill Schieffelin. “If we
beat them.. we could be second-
seeded, and practically assured of a
bid. If we lose. we might sneak in as
the fourth seed.“

Brockpon comes with a 7-5!
record: losses to Frcdonia. Buffalo,
Cornell. Hartwick. and Howard par-
tially balanced with wins over Cor-
tland and Binghamton and atie with

Madison.
Albany show a 9-3~ I'mark: losses

to Buffalo. Union. and Cortland

partially balanced by wins over
Keene State. Genesco. and
Plattsburgh. and title with Onconta.

Brockport scores at a rate of 2.9
goals a game; Albany at 4.0. The
Golden Eagles givethcm up with less
frequency: less than a goal a game
compared to Albany‘s l.o.
Hrockport plays the tougher
schedule. but not muchtougher. and
the tougher teams have done the
winning in those games.

“ i he record for them really does
not tell the whole story.“ said
Schicffeliu. “Theyjust don‘t give up
goals. and with the caliber of their
opposition they have a~high rating.“

“Above all. they are hard-nosed.
physical. and aggressive.“
Schiel'l'clin continued. "They got off
to a terrible start ( l-3) but haveturn—
ed things around.“

To win Albany must control the
ball.on tlte ground. according to
Schicl'felin.

“Against Buffalo We seemed to
lack the motivation.“ said
Schicl'felin. “Some of our guys ap-
parently looked too far ahead. to a
confrontatiott with Binghamton.

Now. it we want that confrontation
we must go out and prove it to the
world. or at least thc'sclections com-
tnittee that Albany State deserves a
bid. II this isn‘t motivation enough.
then maybe nothing is. I know
Brockport's treating it as a' life or
death game."

And indeed the Golden Eagles are
worried. according to Brockport‘s
sports information director Jack
Williams.

“No doubt about it. this is the
biggest game and Coach Bill Hughs
is making no secret of his concern on
our end of it."said Williams. “ l his is
the game for us. We don‘t want to
watch the nationals."

Albany goes into the gatne With
only one question-mark: fullback
Arthur licdford. Bcdl'ord was more
seriously injured than originally
thought to be the ease during the
Geneseo game two weeks ago. and
has not played since that time.

"We can only ltope he‘ll be ready.“
Schiclleltn said.“'l‘hcre is no dottbt
that we missed him in Buflalo, and

when you play any game. let alone
one of such great importance. you
want to go out there with a full.
healthy team."

The game will be broadcast on

diuals in the Dancs' ﬁnal home game‘

by Nathan Salant

The Albany State varsity basket-
ball team receiVed a major shot in the
arm Wednesday when Central
Council approved (20-64) the
squad‘s proposed trip to Poland
scheduled in April.

The bill also applies Albany‘s
share of the Capital District Tourna-
ment (Jamil-4) gate receipts towards
the $10.800it will cost to send the IS
players and coaches. Last year
Albany received trimest $3.000 from
the tournament.

“We are overjoyed at Council's
decision," said varsity basketball
coach Doctor Richard Saucrs. “This
is clearly a step in the right direction
and will help us to obtain the
necessary additional ﬁnancial back-
ing from the Alumni Association
and outside sources on top of what
We will raise ourselves.“

Sauers began ingesligating this
type of overseas exhibition series lust
;.':r in search of educational arid

publicity opportunities for his learn.

“Alter several fruitless conver-
sations l was put lll touch with En-
cttlturation Inc.. an international
organization which handles exactly
these types of affairs." said Sttuers.
"Among the nations seeking
vrsttalions from U..‘;. teams was
Poland and as it was less expensive
than others. we applied."

On September 22 Sauers rccuived
a formal letter oftnvitatton from the
Polish government.

“Its quite an honor to be selected
from among the hundreds of schools
which apply for these opportunities
every year." said Sauers. “More ini-
portantly. it opens uptlte possibility
of many other student association
groups enterittg into similar
arrangements."

NCAA regulations permit teams

to make these types of trips once _

every four years. according to
Sauers. Thus. the soccer team might

NYl’lRG has launched a cam-

paign urging FSA to convert its ven--

ding machines to sell only returnable
bottles in support of the bottle bill
now pending in the statelegislature.

“l'm itt favor of it if we can do it."
said FSA General Manager Norbert
Zahm on Friday. “it is just a matter
of trying to work something out."

Project coordinator Marsha
Seidelman of NYl’lRGis optimistic.
“I think it can work. Binghamton
tried it. and they had a bum deal with
the contracts but they‘re trying
again. And at Cornell it‘s been work-
ing very well."

Start Now

“Our contract with Coca Cola
doesn't run out until the middle of
next summer." explained Zahm.
"but We don‘t haveto wait until then.
it‘s just a matter of working
something out. There are a lot of
people to talk to. a lot of things to
take care of. You‘ve got toremember
that we‘re dealing with a huge
volume here. We‘ve got maybe 600.-
000 cans now, going one way. With
bottles we‘ll have to handle that
same 600,000 both ways. It's too ear-
lyto say what this will mean asfaras
profit."

New York State's bottle bill.
which was defeated last year, is now
awaiting passage. Patterned after
Oregon's I972 ban on non-
returnables. NYPIRG contendsthat
the New York bill offers many ad-
vantages to the consumer:

The other Albany broadcaster is
harrassed by spectators and told his
“next word is (his) last.“

There was a soccer game between
Albany and Brockport played at
Brock port Saturday.(won by
Brockpon. 3- I) but what might have
been one of the ﬁnest exhibitions of
college soccer became a nightmare
when two brawls involving spec-
tators. players. and coaches. plus a
fight behind the stands. interrupted
play three times.

The game took on an ominous
note days before the teams took the
ﬁeld. thanks to a number of com-
ments made by Hughes in several
Rochester newspapers. including:
“right now we’re just concentrating
on this Albany game. I understand
Albany has bussed in players this
season from the New York area and
really become strong." Hughes said.

Other comments allegedly made
by iHughes implied that Albany
had resorted to team of ringers who
did not belong in school and would
flunk out after a year. when in reali-
ty. there are only four freshmen on
the varsity soccer team (only two

Aguilar). Hughes apparently forgot

NYPIRG hopes that it enough

will serve as a clear illustration of the

benefits in store for New York if
legislation is passed this year.

campus to propose a can ban.
Seidelman is conﬁdent that the
students. faced with the added in-
convenience of returning bottle to
crates located next to each machine
will be cooperative. Then according
to NYPIRG. empties can be picked

delivered. But Zahm. faced with the
overall possibility andjeasibility of
the proposal. is still cautious. “it‘s

“Their scorekeeper kept apolog‘z-
ing to me.” said Albany‘s scorer.
Diane Hickey.“but nothing can
make up for what those people did.
And their coach was somethingelse.
Now I understand why their
seorekeeper said he quit the team: he
just couldn‘t stand it."

Hughes was something else. From
the moment he joined his team on
the field. Hughes kept himself oc-
cuppied by arguing every call. in-
sulting the officials all afternoon.
demanding that Albany players (he
referred to them as “spies. triggers
. . .“) be given yellow cards of war-
ning. and above all exhorting his
players and the spectators to “kill
those animals (Albany)“.

“Whenthe ot'ficialstold himlo get
his players off the field during the
fight. he just tapped them on the
shoulder and said ‘nice job‘." said
Albany State's Simon Curanovic.

“I walked up to Hughes and asked
him about the security and protec-
ting our players." Curanovic con-
tinued. and all he said was‘whatam I
supposed to do.‘ " There were two
security guards to control a crowd of
more than 2.000 people.

With ten minutes left in the game.

 . Albany's Jorge Aguilar sought-a ball~ ~

for the upcoming throw-in. As had
been the case all afternoon. the ball-
boy was late gettingthcre. so Aguilar
asked a spectator for the ball which
had been kicked out of bounds and
into the stands by a Brockport
fullback.

“The fan with the ball refused to
give it up and called me a.Spic."
Aguilar said. "so i called to the ref.
The ref did not do anything. sol ask-
ed for the ball again. The guy who
had it didn‘t give-it to me until the
ball boy came up with the other ball.
andthen he threw/it at the. sol kick-
ed it back at him."

“The next thing I knew. the other

'ball had been knocked out of my
hands and someone was punching
me in the head." Aguilar continued.
“Look. I know I shouldn‘t have
kicked the ball back at him. but with
us losing. we needed every second.‘
and l was frustrated from the of-
ficials. the crowd. and their coach.
Besides ltethrew the ball or me afterl
had the other ball.“

Interestingly enough. Aguilar
quickly extricated himself from the
pile of Albany-Brockport ﬁghters
and stood on the side watching it.
