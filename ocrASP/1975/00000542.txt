‘ The library pays for the copying
machine. the paper. the ad-
ministrative details. but it pays no
one for the educational material
which it reprints. In 'fact. the
material that is so valuable to the
students in the class is absolutely
free. ‘

But if Congress passes the
copyright legislation now being con-
sidered by committees in both the
House and Senate. the library would
be liable for a 550.000 line for reprin-
ting those 25 copies. The new law
will protect authors and publishers
from losing revenues because of free
reprints while depriving educators
and libraries of the right to provide
educational materials to students
that might otherwise be unavailable.

Last year. a substantially similar
bill was passed in the Senate but the
session ended before the House con«
sidered its own copyright legislation.
Committee sources in the House
predict that a new copyright bill will
be voted on within the next year.

The new law as proposed would
allow the free duplication of
copyrighted material “for purposes
such as criticism, comme

research.“ This “amorphous doc-
trine” of “fair use." as the Supreme
Court called it last year in ruling on a
copyright case.'varies from case to
ease depending on such intangibles
as “the nature’and purpose” of the
work. the amount copied and the
ﬁnancial effect of copying onthe
potential market for the material.

Fair use does not include what the
bill calls “systematic” reproduction
of copyrighted material. Library
copying for inter-library loans and
reserve copies would probably fall
under this category of “systematic”
reproduction.

In testimony before the House
Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts.
Civil Liberties and the Administra-
tion of Justice this summer.
educators claimed that this bill
would be devastating to theteaching
process. “Educational users need
special protection over and above

.that provided commercial users."

Bernard J. Freitag. a National
Education Association represen-
tative said. “They have a public
responsibility for teaching They
work for people—not for profit."

The benefits of using reprints—
access to material that would
otherwise be too costly for most
libraries and students to afford——
would be lost if the bill were ap-
proved. the educators argued.
Providing resources from a wide
range of journals and collections
gives the student a broader viewthan
if one textbook Were assigned for
each class.

But writers and publishers have a
different perspective. While che

from studeiit pocketbooks. they also

- mean less money in the author’s
bank account. In many cases; this is
a substantial financial loss for the
writer. '

“(Librarians and educatorsh. are-

economic difﬁculties and act like

clutch of hard-nosed capitalists.”
author Michael Mawshaw wrote in,
the Chronicle of Higher Education.
“Does a society that feels it can
casually reproduce and exploit an I
author‘s work for free really respect '
the written word?“

The repercussions of the proposed
legislation are already being felt on
college campuses.

AN ODD REPAIR

The family of" a three~yeanold
child. now a girl but originally a boy.
haVe been awarded 5850.000 by a
Federal Court in Seattle in a medical
malpractice case.

According to testimony in court.
the baby (who was not identified)
was severely burned accidentally by
doctors who were performinga rou-
tine circumcision on the small boy.
The suit states that the burns wereso
extensive that doctors decided to
change the child into a female.

TEA OR ME?

A British doctor says that
thousands of marriagescottld besav-
ed simply 'by replacing the English
afternoon “tea break“ with a “sex
breakJ‘

Doctor Ivor Felstein, writing in
the medical journal Pulse. suggests
that workers should be released from
their jobs for at least an hour each
afternoon so that they can go home
and enjoy private moments with
their spouses.

 
  
   
 

The doctor writes that when the
kids are home in the evenings. in-
timate moments are virtually im-
possible. Doaor Felstein says that
an afternoon sex break would

 

appear to be more un and more
healthy than the current British
practice of running to the tea wagon
at work each day.

NO-ENEROY CRISIS
An increasing number of medical
schools around the United States
have reportedly been struck by a
serious "cadaver shortage.” I
Science Digest magarine reports
that the shortage of bodies is so
serious at some institutions that the
lquality of medical education for
students is being severelythreatened.
The magazine says that the de-
mand for cadavers has increased
from about 500 to 800 per year over
the past decade but that currently
only 200 bodies are being made
available yearly.
The cadaver shortage has been
'triggered by new social welfare
programs whereby public agencies
yield as much as $700 for the funeral
and burial of a friend or relative.
