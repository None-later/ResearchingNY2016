' To the liter: ‘ _
This is in respome to a letter entitled “The
Other Side” which appeared recently in the

ASP. Although I cancertainlyundcrstandthe '
point of view expressed by theauthor. certain .

elements remain to be clarified.

I do not doubt thesineerity orintelligence of
the author. The letter basically stated that the
ASPconstantly presents a one-sided view con-
cerning the Arab-Israeli conﬂict. and while
praising the Jews and the Jewish state. the
ASPeondemns the Arabs. The letter then con-
tinues by suggesting that readers of the ASP
should question the validity of this informa-
tion and consider the opposite point of view.
This point cannot be disputed. I myself have
checked the accuracy of some of these
statements and have found them to be true.
However. the opposite point of view should be
taken into account. and I would like to see an
article by Maha Hamden or some other
spokesperson for the Arab perspective.

My main criticism concernsthe point in this
letter which states that the Jews constantly
complain of their suffering in order to gain
sympathy. particularly from Americans, “so
as to achieve their goals" and gain support "to
their cause.“ The letter also hints that since the
Jews complain so much. the cause oftheir suf-
fering probably lies with themselves. and not
their persecutors. Not only do these remarks
lack reason or understanding. but 'they border
on hostility.

Maha Hamden. the author of “The Other
Side“ made use of a fundamental right——
freedom ol' the press. As many flaws as this
country has. Americans are entitled to
freedom of religion. freedom of speech. as well
as many other opportunities which are often
taken for granted. In Russia. newspapers con-
centrate on the Arab side. If Maha Hamden
was a Jew in Russia and wrotea letter wishing
to see more articles supportinglsrael. not only
would that letter never have been printed. hut
Maha Hamden would have been investigated
and possibly arrested. It is much easier for us
to close our eyes and turn‘ our backs on
persecutions of freedoms—freedoms which
Americans take for granted—than to face the
ugliness that goes on in this world. In the great
majority of cases of religious. economic.
political or other persecutions that take place.
the people under attack all have one thing in
common. regardless of race. creed. sex or
religion: they are all political and numerical
minorities.

Maha Hamdcn states that it is understan-
dable that the majority has more privileges
thanthe minority. But privilege is not the same
as suppression. Throughout history the Jews
have shared the experience of other minorities
whether it be in Europe or the Middle East.
whether it be centuries ago or in this century.
It is therefore necessary that there be a place
somewhere on this earth where the Jews no
longer constitute a minority. subject to the
whims of the ruling ethnic group. There must
be a place where the Jews are the rulers and
not the ruled; a place where other suffering
Jews can go in time of need. There is only one
solution to this so'called Jewish problem: the
establishment and survival of the state of
Israel.

Advisement Blues

To the Editor:

Having been a student here. for five
semesters. I think I‘ve either experienced or
heard about most of the negative aspects of
prevregistration; however. what about the pre-
prevrcgistration process? Everyone knows you
can't stand on lines if you haven‘t seen your
advisor and gotten tr program card.

The majority ofstudents start out in the Un-
iversity College advisement center. llcing a

result of this. I have changed my malorthree
times. ’

v I am presently enrdlled in the school of
Buiness Administration. and am therefore
under the auspices of Helen T. Pelersi, alias
Helen Campbell. She has instituted a
procedure called “Operation Educational
Planning." Supposedlyit's forthose who com-
plain that: “Heck. I can do that myself—I-
don't need'an advisor." Some of the 900
students that Helenls responsible for obvious-

ly don't need help. but I feel many. including '

myself. could use the counseling of ‘a
knowledgeable. well-trained advisor. Even if a

maximum of Hit ofthese 900 wishto seek her ‘

out for advisement, this seems to be an im-
possible number to fit into herﬁxed three hour
per week schedule allotted to advisement.

I saw her one morning after waiting about
45 minutes. only to receive a brief. concise
speech that sounded as rehearsed as any
political news release. In other words. she was
no helpand I am therefore tryingtoget advice
from some of my professors. only one of
whom seems to take any interest. Though.
wouldn't you know it. he's in the English
Department.

I can't hold Helen completely responsible.
someone else obviously decided that we need
only one advisor for 900students. It really isn't
her fault that only three hours a week can be
devoted to communication with students;
there must be a tremendous amount of paper
work to keep everything runningas smoothly
as she does.

I sometimes wonder. if'college is an impor-
tant part of life‘s experiences as I truly believe
it is. shouldn‘t we have a stronger and more
student oriented dcpanment devoted to ad-
visement!

I57 er Day

To the Editor:

I recently read in the November 3 issue of
the Tower Tribune that the campus security
staff issued 4.724 parking tickets in the month
of September. Elementary mathematics shows
us that the campus police average [57.46

. tickets per day. The article also mentioned

that total offenses rose 5.5 percent. I would
like to know how the police would knowthis.
seeing as they are spending so much time
writing tickets.

I myself do not have a car on campus.
however I would venture that my roommate
has accumulated a sizeable bulk of that total.
One of my suitemates isn't doingall that poor-
ly either. ltherefore am not allthat far remov-
ed from the situation. I have found that prac-
tically all of their tickets aren't their fault.
They don't purposely break the laws for the
adventure or risk involved. It is either because
the parking facilities are inadequate or
because the laws arejust plain stupid. The fact
that 4.724 offenses occurred in one month
bears this point out.

I do not wish toelahoratc further and by do-
ing so bury the facts in witty rhetorical prose.
They speak for themselves and clearly indicate
that reforms are needed in botlt parking
facilities and regulations,

Flooding the Media

To the Editor:

For sometime now I have been trying to ig-
nore the latest flooding of SUNYA‘s informa-
tion media with pro-Zionist material. But it

Ve‘gone through a

 

goesonandonlikeT. . a V _
to win' one's mind by hammering at it cocon-
sistently until. it'becotnea soft enough to buy
anything. The irony of 1 Is that no matter how
powerful Zionists become their strategy
remains playing the underdog. Notice. how
Michael Cohen. in' the November 7 ASP. is
“sickened by the apathetic nature of Jews on
campus." And yet. look around you: articles.
posters. meetings, demonstrations-all for
Zionism. Has anyone issue received halfaa
much attention on this campus? Has any other
one group been halfaa active? Neticethe situa-
tion in the Mid-East: Israel occupying
territory from three neighboring countries
that adds up to more than the size of Israel.
And yet the Zionists appeal for help to a
persecuted people.

Asking Jews to be active in Jewish activities is
line. All people should be aware of their iden-
tity and Culture. But Jewa should also beaware
that their identity is not necessarily Zionist. It
is a Zionist strategy to confuse this issue.
Zionism is a political ideology whose biggest
agenda item was the establishment ofa Jewish
state. Part of the Zionists' strategy included
purposely allowing the death of some Jews as
well as themselves killing Jews at times in
order to dramatize their issue and hasten the
creation of Israel in I948. Zionist strategy
remains till this day to hammer on peoples‘
emotions. confuse the facts. and use horrible
memories to fester a paranoia amongstJewish
people to enlist their support for Israeli
policies no matter what those policies may be.
Michael Cohen writes: “Idi Amin called at the
UN for an end to ALL JEWS." Aminsaid
nothing of the kind! He called for an end to
Zionism. The Anti-Zionist resolution calls on
UN members to condemn a political ideology
that perpetuates expansion. denies even the
existence of Palestinians. and denies Jewish
individuals the right of dissent. Any Jew who
disagrees with Israeli policies is called a self-
hater. This is the Zionismthat Arabs condemn
and indeed some Jewish people condemn as
well.

Zionism is identiﬁed with Jewishness only
in minds brainwashed by Zionists. Jews havea
rich cultural heritage going back over 4000
years. Zionism is a political ideologythat was
institutionalized in the first Zionist Congress
of l89x. I invite Jewish students on this cam-
pus not to be limited and. confused by 20th
century politicians but to seek a wider perspec-
tive on which to base their judgment. Before
you demonstrate against a resolution. ask peo-
ple who advocate it what they mean by it. At a
time when the Mid- East is beginning to drift
towards peace don't let your emotions be used
in contrary directions. This is a time for
reason.

Lady of Liberty?

To the Editor:

She stands at the entrance to New York
Harbor. A woman who for thousands. past.
present. and future. represents Iibeny and
freedom. How ironic that this ﬁgure be a
woman. How ironic that she stands at the en-
trance to New York State.

We. the residents of New York State do not
deserve to have this woman as our represen-
tative for liberty. In light ofthe defeat ofthe
Equal Rights Amendment. she is the only
woman in New York State who is free.

Women have the freedom to decide to re-
main at home and raise a family with their
husbands. This choice should not be
downgraded. llut so too must women havethe
freedom to opt for something else. A woman's
mind is no less able thrrna man‘s. Ifshe desires

Coming Out
of Hiding

To the Editor:

In his letter of November 7. I975 Michael
Cohen tried to write a very heart rendering.
guilt producing letter to raise some SUNYA
support for the recent anti-Zionist legislation
in the UN. I must say. his speech didn't affect
in the intended manner. As a matter of fact, I
was quite repulsed by it. I consider myself a
tremendous Zionist. When the last war broke
out I started packing for Israel. and would
probably be there right now if my parents
hadn't spent two weeks talking me out of it. Ifl
had the money, I would have gone regardless
of my parents' wishes. but I didn‘t have the
means to get over there. so I did what I could
from America. I‘ve been a member of the JDL
since the ‘67 war so this was where I did most
of my rallying. talking. collecting. etc. . . l was
and still am involved as much as possible. But
it is involvementthatdocsn'tineiudetheJSC.

I must empathetically state that the JSC is
not only a clique. but a very closed clique. If
one does not measure up to their standards.
one will not be accepted. I should know; for
two years I tried tojoin the JSC. only tofind
that the JSC didn't want me tojointltem. The
snobbery that I encountered is not unique.
Many people who attended a General Meeting
were never seen again. This is because. if you
do not follow the hypocritical religious ways
of most of the members (I've seen many yar—
mulka wearing members at Friday night
movies). you are not accepted. and can forget
about being a member.

Mr. Cohen ends his letter with reference to
the survivors of the concentration camps in
Europe. He tries to make the reader feel guilty
for not attending JSC functions (e.g.
Kazablan. Carnal Knowledge. coffee houses.
etc.). by having us explain our non-activeness
to survivors ofthese dcat h camps. Well. I have
the non-unique displeasure of act ualiy doing
this. My mother. grandmother. and my aunt
are all survrvors of Riga. My mother. who was
blinded in her left eye by the Germans. un-
derstands why I do not participate in JSC
functions. although she still wishes that I keep
and express my Judaism in some way. I still
do. I will always express my Judaism in some
form. not by attending supposedly Jewish
oriented functions. but by giving as much sup-
port as possible to Israel so that my children
and their children do not end up like my
grandfather and uncle. iampshades in some
ani‘s living room.

Speed and the Marijuana Limit

 E, David Troeg

Previously the use of marijuana was seen as
a clear evil because it was not understood. It
was. in a very simple manner. seen to be ofthe
same magnitude in illegality and immortality
as so—callcd “hard drugs." It was against the
law to possess marijuana therefore it had to be
"bad."

llut over the last few years the condescen-
ding vicw of those ignorant to pot has evolved
into a cynicism towards a law forbidding a
relatively innocuous substance.

The cry across the land from those who
smoke it is that it should be legalired. Why
should someone who partakcs of a substance
not any worse than alcohol be considered a
criminal‘! Even if we agree that cigarettes and
alcohol should remain legal and "hard" drugs
should remain illegal. what about pot“! It holds
a rather ambiguous position. It seems to be iii
the middle of the two extremes; wiry not just
legalize it and be done with it?

Let's look at this in a broader perspective.
that of all foreign substances which affect the
body: cigarettes. alcohol. marijuana. and hard
drugs. There are those who advocate that use
of any item which affects behavior is a matter
of personal discretion and personal freedom.
We have the right to do with our bodies as we
wish. That is a fine libertarian ideal. but even
in a democracy, when dealing with reality.
there are limits. Democracy is one step short
of anarchy. but it is not anarchy itself. So. at
times a democratic government l’indsit proper
to act in a paternalistic manner to protect
ourselves from each other.

Drugs are not the only area in which
government restricts us in order to protect
ourselves. Another area falls in the category of

Moi vechicles. when the state mandates
maximum speed limits on such thoroughfares
as the Thiuway.

The state speed limit is now 55 miles per
hour. There are those who keep to the speed
limit. there are those who moderately vary by
driving from 55-65. and there are those who
drive well beyond the speed limit.

Someone who drives 60 or 65 on the
Thruway would not be considered a criminal.
yet, technically. if caught by a state trooper
they‘d be in violation ofthe law and would be
subject to paying a fine. Ignoring the energy
reasons. why doesn't the state choose a higher
or lower speed limit than 55. after all the vast
majorin who moderately violate are usually
not pulled over. but theycan be subject to such
action. The important issue here is that en-
forcement has to begin at some point. Coming
back to pot, the government has to choose
some point at which to begin enforcingagainst
use of drugs.just as it must choose some point
at which to begin enforcing a speed limit; a
point which it views as being in the interests of
the society as a whole.

Social change seems to hi ngc on the middle
class. When they are mobilized by issues that
hit home and stick in the "gut" thenit istime
that the established values come under
scrutiny and revision. The necessary and im-
portant revision with marijuana lies.
signiﬁcantly. in decriminalizingit tothc extent
ofit being subject to no morcthanamonetary
fine. equivalent to that experienced by a driver
caught violatingthe speed limit by five to ten
miles per hour.

Both use of marijuana and moderate viola-
tion of the speed limit are so prevalent and
commonplace that they are largely subjective
ex perienccs for us. This however does not rule
out the objective role of government inchoos—
ing points of differentiation forcreating social
order and discipline

TERA Fails

 

Election Day 1975 slipped by this past Tuesday and New 'Yorkds'tatetslipped up.

- Failing to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the state that was an inspiration to the

proposed amendment to the federal constitution could not muster enough support to
convert the ‘liberal‘ talk and intellectual agreement into law.

There are many reasons why the ERA failed. We should examine them now. while
they are fresh and maybe next time the voters will understand it's importance. ,A
major factor in its defeat was the low voter turnout. nothing new in America but this
turnout was low evenfor America. This year‘s ballot had no drawing pdwer, there were
no major offices at stake. no favorite sons and the motive of Watergate revenge faded
away. In short. there was nothing to inspire people to get out the vote — just the plain
old issue upon which this nation was founded: equal rights and opportunityforall. ,

The opposition. of course, had to have a part in the amendment's failure.
Operation WAKE—UP for example. full of happy housewives who so
desperately want the respect given other professionals that they must publicly glorify
their way of life by ﬁghting an amendment that would have opened or conﬁrmed
options for many other worthwhile lifestyles. Campaigns to prey upon the electorate's.
ignorance of the ERA‘s purpose played a major role in twisting its real aim. The aim

‘ was just to finally have a clear constitutional basis to support ﬁghts for equal pay.

credit ratings. job opportunities. and so on. For all intents and puroses the opposition
drowned out the real goals with noise about rampant homosexuality and the collapse
of the American family-as we know it today.

Lastly. the issue hits home. Many students now regret their neglect to secure their
absentee ballots in time. Unfortunately. regret set in when the results were in.
Thousands of students who could have voted did not.

The defeat of the ERA is not only a victory for apathy. but also for injustice.

Relevant Academics

Aphis time of year we all visit the U lounge of Colonial Quad to preregister.

'Sometimes We are motivated to do so for reasons other than our direct pursuit of a

degree; we are interested in learning about something for curiosity‘s sake .or for our
future occupation.

The selection of courses is often more ofa problemthanthe infamous registration
process itself . however. The problem centers around thercalizationthat what is taught
within the university has little to do with the “real world" outside.

In pursuing any activity or occupational interest. it is clearthat aclass can only serve
as an approximation of any field of study, as the activity is far too dynamic. its
nuances too subtle for academia to represent completely.

Ask someone who has tried to find field-related work and they will tell you that
prospective employers are more impressed by a resume which includes on-the-job
experience or extra‘curricular participation than one that does not. It is logical to
expect the employer to weigh such experience more heavily than the additional .2or .3
of cum your more grade-wise but less job-wise competition might have.

The value of relevant academics is something which most students have come to
realize—but equally important is realizingthe benefits ofa balanced mixture between
that and extra-curricular activities or part-time employment.
