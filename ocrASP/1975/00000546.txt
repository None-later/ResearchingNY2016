play resumed. and Carlos Arango
put Albany on the scoreboard. mak-
ing it a 2-l game. but Brockport‘s
Marcello Curi scored his second goal
of the game to put it out of reach
with three minutes to play.

Then. the rumble resumed.

A Brockport player committed an
obstruction foul. a hand ball. and
then attempted to coverthe ball with
his body according to Ricardo Rose.
The official did not blow his whistle
to stop play. so Aguilar and Rose
continued their attempts to remove
the ball from under the Brockport
player. Eventually he was kicked and
both benches emptied.

“We did not do it on purpose."
Rose later explained. “Wouldn‘t it
be stupid to start something with the
home team in front of a crowd of
2.000. especially after the first ﬁght?
“the official did not do hisjob.then
it's his fault. As a player. it's myjob

_ Defensive Une Sold

“Our defensive line was solid. but
there was not much of an offensive
line to worry about.” said Coach
Ford. In fact. Plattsburgh gained
only 60 yards on the ground as com-
pared to 499 for Albany. Duprey‘s
202-yards rushing may have
overshadowed Matyszezyk‘s 99
yards on nine carries—but it did not
prevent Ford from commenting on
what he termed. “the excellent run-
ning by our substitute backs."

Only Saturday‘s game at
Springfield remains on the schedule.

and Coach Ford is already looking

toward it.
"Next week‘s game is a must.“ he
said.
