participate in the, NCAA Eastern
Regional Tournament.

Despite Saturday‘s 3-l loss at
Broekport. the Booters were named
as the fourth seed and will meet top-
seeded Binghamton Saturday. at
Iinghamton. at I p.m. *

The other match-up shows New
Jersey Tech hosting Brockport inthe
battle between the second and third
seeds. .

_The winners meet a week from this
Saturday at the home ﬁeld of the
highest remaining seed. Fourth-
seeded Albany will beforced to play
all of their games on the road.

The national championships are
scheduled at Broekport. November
29-30.

“I am sure we will give a good ac-
count of ourselves." said Albany var-
sity soccer coach Bill Schieffelin.
“We all wanted to play Binghamton
very badly. and now we have our
shot at them. and a chance to vin-
dicate ourselves from the University

The Albany-Binghamton soccer

State's history until this past Satur-
day‘s game at Brockport, in which
the Booters were subjected to all
sons of verbal and physical abuse
(see front page story).

In I973. Albany traveled to
Binghamton for the UC Cham-
pionships and defeated the hosts. 3-

Two weeks later. Binghamton met
Albany at SUNYA in the ﬁrstround
ot‘the NCAA Tournament, and once
again it was the visiting team which
came out on top. with Binghamton
winning. 2-]. in suddcnt death over-
time. .

“Our players have worked really
hard this year." Schieffclin said.
“and I believe that our actions on
and off the field show this team has
matured a lot. especially in com-
parison to last year.“

Brockport Dumps Albany

by Nathan Salent

In a game plagued by two major
brawls and outstanding un-
sportsmanlike conduct by the host
Golden Eagles and their coach. Bill
Hughes, the Albany State varsity
soccer team was defeated 3-] by
Brockport to complete Albany's
regular season record at 9-4-l.

Bill Cupello riﬁed a 30-yard blast
into the upper left corner of the
Albany net midwaythrough thefirst
half. and Marcello Curi converted

Danes Destroy Cardinals, 66-12

by Mike Plekerskl

Dave Duprey‘s three touchdowns
and 202-yards rushing. led the
Albany Great Danes‘ varsity foot-
ball team to a 66-l2 shellacking of
the Plattsburgh Cardinals at Univer-
sity Field. Saturday.

The win was the Danes’ sixth of
the‘ season (against two losses). and
was their largest margin of victory
this year. The 66 points scored fell
only nineshort of the club record set
last year at Massachusetts Maritime.

But the contest. pitting “two an-
evenly matched teams.” in the words

of Albany head coach Robert Ford.
did not really pt rolling until the se-
cond quarter.

It began rather slugglishly. After
the Cardinals had received the open
ing kick off. both teemstrsded pants
and seemed unsbleto get any serious
threat started.

Both teams played with makeshift
bscklields. Albany's Torn Delllois
and Orin Grifﬁn (both recovering

from injuries) Were replaced by Mike
Mirabella end Duprey. respectively.

while Plattsburgh‘s Tom Nels and
Tim Conrad took over for the in-
jured Jim Fraser and Bob Mehan.

Things picked up with only a few
minutes left in the first quarter.
Followinga Cardinals punt. Albany ,

took control on the Plattsburgh
48 but were sent back ﬁfteen yards
because of a holding penalty.

Facing a ﬁrst-and-twenty-l'ive.
Danes quarterback John Bertulzi
handed off to Duprey who broke a
tackle at the line of scrimmage.
found running room on the outside.
and raced 54 yards down the
sidelines before being knocked out
of bounds on the Plattsburgh nine.
On the next play. Duprey took the
pitchout on the right side and
barreled into right corner for the ﬁrst
score of the game.

The conversion by Duprey failed.
but the hard-nosed sophomore was
by no means through for the day.

After Tony DiLorenzo's 33-yard
ﬁeld goal had cut the lead in half just
before the second period. Duprey
went back to work.

With four minutes gone inthe sc-
cond quarter. the Danes had
penetrated deeply into Plattsburgh
territorythankstoafumblc recovery
on the 32 yard line. Three plays
yielded little yardage. and on fourth
down. the Danes brought in their
kicking unit. Holder Dave Ahonen
received the snap. but instead of set-
ting it down. he picked it up. rolled
right. and ﬁred a strike to Duprey
who scampered into the endzone for
the touchdown. Ahonen found
Duprey again on the conversion
pass. and it was l4—3.

A few minutes later. the Danes
faced a second and four from their
own 37 when Duprey again got the
call. This time he broke afewtackles
and veered .down the right sideline
all the way for a 63 yard
touchdown—his third of the day.
The score now was: Duprey 20.
Plattsburgh 3. AI Martin’s kick was
good and it seemed to cage the Car-
dinsls.

But on the ensuing kickoff. Ver-

conllnued on pageﬂjiesn

on a 2-on-0 breakaway early in the
second half. to give Brockport a 2-0
lead.

Carlos Arango put Albany onthc
scoreboard with ten minutes to play.
but Curi's second tally with three
minutes remaining iced it for the
Eagles.

“We played a very good
Brockport team." said Albany varsi-
ty soccer coach Bill Schieffelin.
“They were very aggressive and
physical and succeeded in keeping
the ball in the air. thustaking advan-
tage of their height.“

The first brawl erupted just before
Arango‘s goal. when Jorge Aguilar
was attacked by a spectator while
attempting an Albany throw-in.
Both benches emptied. and play was
delayed about five minutes while the
officials and coaches attempted to
separate the teams.

A Matter of Time

Actually. it was only a matter of
time. with the actions Hughes con-
sidered. before a fight broke out.

"The behavior of their coach was
totally inexcusable." said Albany's
ccntcr halfback John Rolando.
“Throughout the game he kept call-
ing us a bunch of animals. and told
his players we were Spics and
Niggers and how they should beat
the shit out of us.“

“When derogatory racial slurs
are used as a coachingtechnique you
havctoquestionthe value ofsports."
said Schieffclin. “I tend to suspect
the attitude of the coach. players.
and crowd had a deﬁnite effect on
the outbreaks. as well as out play.
We were not intimidated. We were
out and out frightened for our safe-
ty."
The fan who attacked Aguilar was
subsequently stopped by WSUA

broadcaster Stu Shalat. who was
then attacked by several other fans.
knocked unconscious. and rctnoved
from the area in an ambulance.

The second brawl exploded late in
the game. when apparent hand-ball
and obstruction violations ware not
called by the officials. The violator
covered the ball with his body. and
as the whistle did not sound. play
continued. resulting in the
Brockport player being kicked. and
a bench-clearing free for all.

Albany's squad generally avoided
any prolonged fighting with the
Brockport squad. perhaps more out
of fear of the 2.000 or so fans. but
more out of maturity. according to
Schicl'fclin.

"I am extremely proud ofthe way
our players conducted themselves."
said Schieffclin. “I think it was a
credit to Albany State. Last year‘s
team might have reacted in a very
different manner. and. had a full
scale riot occurrcd. we probably
would not have gottenthe bid tothc
NCAA Tournament.“

Henry Obwald turned in tin out-
standing gamc. stopping six
breakaways and making a total of lo
saves.

“He was totally outstanding.“ said
Schicffclin. “Head and shoulders. he
played better than anyone.“

Schicl'fclin was still visiny upset
by the non-playing aspects of Satur-
day's affair when contacted Mon-
day.

“I am still very disappointed and
quite shocked at what went on." the
coach said. “They destroyed a good
soccer game. There are certain ethics
and rules of the game. as well as
professional courtesies which were
violated. and I guaranteethe proper
action will be taken.”

JV Gridders Nail Williams, 22-8

by Michael Smith

Albany State's JV‘s offense ran
like a well-greased machine Friday
at University Field against Williams
College. The only problem with the
machine was that most of the after-
noon it was stuck in F (for fumble)
gear. No less than l2 times the
machine‘s output registered this:
pitchout. l0 yard gain. cloud of dust
and cough up the football.

John Crea's offense did shift gears
long enough to hold onto the
slippery pigskin during three long
touchdown drives which. parlayed

with another strong defensive effort
by Mike Garcia's purple gang.
produced a thrill-a-minute 22-8
drubbing over a Williams team
whose varsity is currently ranked
above Albany in the Lambert voting.
“It wasn’t very pretty but we'll
take the victory. the hard way." Crea
admitted afterward. “I think it
would be quite an understatement to
say we had a bit of a problem holding
onto the football.“
The Pups fumbled I2 times, but
the key to the game's outcome was

ACT IV will not be published this
semester. According to Co-
coordinator Robin Mandelker the
main reason for ACT‘s cancellation
is a lack of student volunteers.

ACT (Assessment of Courses and
Teachers) needs about 200-250
volunteers to handle evaluations.
This semester only about l25
volunteers signed up to cover classes.
From past experience. ACT coor-
dinators have found that the most
effective way of getting classes
covered was to have volunteers han-
dle the evaluations of their own
classes.

Mandelker was extremely dis-
illusioned at the lack of student
cooperation. “Some people just sign
up for one class.“ she said. “They say
that ‘I don't want my other classes
evaluated.‘ That's what disappointed
me the most. I hadthought ACT was
more student oriented."

ACT had advertised in the Albany
Student Press for volunteers but
they had not received any response
from students. During ACT book
sales in the Campus Center and on
three ofthe Quads they managed to
sign up the l25 volunteers.

Besides the lack of volunteers to
cover class evaluations, AC’I‘s three
coordinators Robin Mandelker.
Paul Rockwell and David Bloom
had trouble taking over the opera-
tion after being usedto working with

Stony Brook

Volunteer Shortage  ACT 

working on the book during the i

a greater number of coordinators in
previous semesters.

Paul Rockwell felt that AC'I‘s
failure was due to a combination of
two factors. “There was a lack of
communication between the coor-
dinators and a lack of student in-
put." said RockWeII.

The originator of ACT. David
Abramoff was very distressed over
the situation. Said Abramoff, “I
thought it would continue, Ithink it
still can continue. I think there are
people in Albany who care as much
about it as the people who started
AC'I‘ to continue it."

Mandelker. Rockwell and Bloom
were all emphatic that ACT will be
published next semester. Abramoff
however was not convinced that
ACT could not be saved this
semester. “With a little bit of solid
work for 20 or 30 hours you could
put the whole thing back together."
he said. Abramoff is now studying
law at George Washington Universi-
ty in Washington. DC.

Mandelker feels that ACT
deﬁnitely needs more people who are
willing to work hard to pull ACT
together for next semester. “We
would need four top people who
would be willing to dedicate l0.
maybe 15 hours a week." said
Mandelker.

Mandelker. a business major. feels
that working on ACT is a “terrific
organizational task." They started

Fights SASU

Delegate Third World War

by Paula Rasnick

Due to what has been called the
unrepresentive and possibly illegal
seating often Third World delegates
to the Student Association of the
State University (SASU). Stony
Brook has frozen its membership
funds to that organization. Whether
or not Stony Brook withdraws is
dependent of the findings of Senate
lawyer Denis Hurley. and subse
quent actions by SASU. '

According to Stony Brook Senate
Treasurer Mark Minasi. the Third
World has in the past harassed other
‘dclcgates and preventedthe passage
of important resolutions. Secretary
Stan Greenberg agreed to the extent
that at many meetings the delegates
get “so caught up in arguing about
Third World problems that little else
gets accomplished."

Stony Brook has suspended its
funds pending investigation by
Hurley. If the caucus is found to be
illegal. Stony Brook would request
that it be voted out of SASU. and
then rc-join. Stan Greenberg said
that he did not know what would
happen if the caucus was declared
legal. Hurley's investigation revolves
around what Senate president Earle
chrin called "sloppy" procedum
in the sealing of the Third World
delegation. A decision is not ex-
pected for several weeks.

A Third World caucus had existed
without voting power and had been
viewed as a valuable means of
.providing information about
minority problems. SASU's twenty-
one member campuses were to hold
elections last spring, and select a

total of twentyseight Third World-

eaucus members. ten of whom would
be chosen to be voting delegates.
However. only ﬁve or six schools
picked ten members. and not all of
them belonged to the Third World.

mor voiced the opinion that

sities was unrepresentativc. Mark

Mark Greenberg. former ACT
coordinator and editor. now at Har-

ed about future ACTs. “ People don't
realize." he said. “that it‘s a full time
job to get the students out.“

Mandelker plans to start early
next semester in recruiting
volunteers to cover classes. She
plans to begin sign up as early as
drop-add week in orderto insure get-
ting enough student volunteers.

SUNY Trustees To Buy State University
Construction Bonds With Endowment Funds

by Larry Lopez (SUNN)

The State University Board of
Trustees voted Thursday morningto
invest up to $7.325 million of its $43
million endowment fund in Housing
Finance Agency-State University
construction bonds. These will pay
off short term notes that come due
today. assuring continuation of
some of SUNY‘s construction
program.

SUNY will use the money to retire
the short-term HFA notes and buy
30~year bonds bearing nine percent
interest. Purchase of the bonds will
assure that State University con-
struction continues even if HFA
defaults on the rest of the $I30
million in obligations that come due
November 14.

H FA is a moral obligation agency.

tion agency because. until the
buildings are built. there is nothing
creditors can seize if HFA defaults.

The construction itself is funded
through the sale of short-term notes
which are usually due in a year or

less. When those notes come due“

they are paid either by selling more
notes for uncomplctcd buildings or
bonds for completed buildings.
Bonds. which are paid off over 30
years. allow SUNY or other
borrowers to pay off the loan
gradually. If the borrower does not
pay offthe bond. the lender can seize
the building.
‘Time Is a Factor

A spokesperson for HFA in New
York City said Thursday evening
that the agency still does not know if
it will be able to put together a
package in time to save itself from
default today.
