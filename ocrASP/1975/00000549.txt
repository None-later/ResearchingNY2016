A faculty committee at
Southeastern Massachusetts 'Urr-
ivei'sity introduced a proposal for
plus/minus grading at the school.
sayingrthat it would reduce the
effects of grade inﬂation prevaleil
on many campuses.

Another beneﬁt of a revised
grading system. according to the
committee, would bethat instructors
would have “the opportunity to
make a ﬁner distinction“ in gradinga
student‘s performance.

The effect of plus/minus grades
would be tocreate I I possible grades
instead ol'the usual A-F range. On a
four point grade scale. for instance.
students would be awarded a 3.0 for
a Ila 3.3forva 8+, anda3.7foran
A‘. l

The prospect of greater accuracy
in grading hasn‘t thrilled students at
Iowa State University where a
plus/minus grading system has also
been proposed. The student senate
there passed a recommendation that
the new grading system not be put
into effect. Senators argued that

FBI Harasses Campus Radicals

by Allan Rablnowltz (CPS)

No one is surprised anymore by
reports of domestic surveillance by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI). But spying and harassment of
campus radicals and radical
organizations was practiced on a
massive. systematic level. documents
recently made public reveal.

Documents obtained! in-
dependently by Senator Frank
Chureh (D-iD). the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA). the Socialist
Workers Party (SWl’) and various
indivtduttls who made use of the
Freedom of lnlormation Act. show
that the FBI set up phony college
newspapers. sent anonymous.
derogatory letters to parents and
professors. personally intimidated
members of certain strident groups
and kept tabs on black student
organizations. In addition.

Senators  feh‘fhat' the

for faculty to dole out lower gates.
“The difference between air And
a 0* isn't as peat uthat between an
A and I," said one senator. “Iothe
. decision wouldn't be as hard."

The suggestion for minus and plus
grading at Iowa drifted down from
the graduate school, which was con-
cerned because they thought the
traditional A through F system was
unfair. 0n the graduate level. a
graduate school committee said. a
high number of A's and 8's are
issued. The committee said’ that a
finer distinction between letter
grades would be more fair.

Undergraduates have argued that
whilethe plus/minus gradingsystem
might be more fair to graduates. they
aren't interested if their own grades
are being risked.

The plus/ minus grading system
will be up for a faculty vote late in
November. and corild go into effect
next year.

At the University of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee, where grade point
averages have gone up from a 26in
I970 to 28 currently. a plus-minus
grading system has already been im-
plemented. It will rcmainateacher‘s

grading system. and teachers at the

Hoover concentrated the in-

given to Church's committee.

An English professor atthc school
was unenthusiastic. saying that it
was “among other thing. tinkering
with a system that I'd rather see
move the other way. I wantedto see
grading dc—emphasizcd. I won't use
it until it becomes mandatory,“ he
said.

An anthropology professortook a
different View. however. claimingthe
system would “relieve all the pangs
of conscience of giving someonea B
when they were almost uptoan A.“

But at Brigham Young University.
where plus/ minus grading has been
in effect for more than 25 years. an
adminstrator for academic affairs
doubted the system would have any
effect on grade point averages at
schools starting the policy.

SASU Holds 

they do anything forthe city they will

Elizabeth Naismlth

SASU. (the Student Association
of the State University) organized a
teach-in for aid to New York City
last Sunday night in the Campus
Center Ballroom. 60 students at the
meeting were exhorted to attend the
proposed Washington lobby on
November 18 and to write letters to
congressmen in support oftbc ﬁght

against default by the major
metropolis.
Dianne Piche. SASU co-

ordinator at SUNYA said “students
know that if the city defaults. New
York State will follow.“

Before the meeting several
students in the audience gave their
opinions. Robert Holland said “I
live in Brooklyn and I believe that if

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

have to do it for every city. Maybe if
they guarantee the bonds and make
sure that the city pays the price. no
other city would want to follow
suit...“ he also said “I don't think the
state will fall.“

Jeff Enzrutty said “This is a very
serious problem and unless it is
resolved it could be tragic for the
state. The relevance of the domino
reaction is very important.“

Another student. Diana Stupple
said “I think the federal government
is making a big mistake ignoring the
situation. The taxable bond plan is
good. and I believe they should
guarantee 6 billion in taxable‘bonds
so that people can help themselves.
Also the trip to Washington is I

a good move by SASU.”

Invited speakers were Linda
Lomel. assistant to the Lieutenum

(toyernortl’rol’essor Bernard John- '

poll of the Politicirl Science Depart-

ment; Robert Kirkpatrick. President.

of SASU and Joel Pucker. legislative
director. for SASU.

Professor James Picreson, a
political science faculty member.
was in the audience. He said. “In
supporting federal interVention
students can have a politicril impact.
As for organizing trips to
Washington. I ant not certain_ofthe
effect. but they are getting people to
understand what is happening. The
federal government should
guarantee the city bonds because
they will hate to intervene
afterwards. and it would be less pain-
ful to do so now." _ ~

The first speaker. Professor John-
poll. criticized what he called
“malaise ol federal and at times state
government. New York City has
carried the burden for It prolligate
nation and ti prolligtrle state. They
paid a disproportionately high part
ol'tltc state taxes and tltey offered an
easy pocket to pick.“

Liiidri |,.orncl said “New York is
provrding nrore services to more
people than any other city but is
keeping the messicst books. They
could not pay ofl'sltort term bonds.
and tried to turntltcm into longtertn
bonds paying outrageous interest
rates of 7%. 8% rind 9% because
nobody wanted to buy them." She
continued "The state and city must
cut brick on all the programs which
some people call frills. People will
have to see that the whole nation will

suffer. and they must understand
that New York does not exist by
itself." She explained this point
further by saying that New York
bondholders incl tide banks in other
sltttcs and countries.

Kirkpatrick said: “It New York
City is allowed to default and the
state follotts. confidence in the
municipal bond market would be
shattered. An analysis done by the
Congressional Joint Economic
(‘omriiitlcc has shown that interest

Apathy Toward Default

llrc meeting broke tip into small
groups to arrange the implementa-
tion oi the letterwrtting campaign
and the Washington lobby. I’ichecx-
pressed disappointment at the
relatively small turn out ol students.
and it was agreed by several
members at SASII that many
students ll:t\t' not appreciated the
seriousness of the situation.
