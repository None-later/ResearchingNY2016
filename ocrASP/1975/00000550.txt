Dr. Gottschallt was music chair-.

normal plan for departmental chair-
man was two 3 year terms. Among
the achievements made during his
term of office was an increase in
enrollment . from 25 music majors. to
about I40. Gottschalk said. “this in-
dicates that we've something right."
He also pointed out that. the

serves the broad education that is so
necessary at the undergraduate level.
But he continued. within that broad

education. there is room for special '

Dr. Gottschalk feels that the time
is very appropriate for an evaluation
because of the search for a new chair-

for someone with new ideas tocome

The. AC Nielsen Company. the
firm which publishes ratings of all
T. V. shows, admits that a few of its
selected viewers are kooks.

Nielsen has wired the T.V. sets of
1200 selected Americans in order to
gauge what programs seem to be
watched.

Variety magazine reports that a
Nielsen executive has conﬁrmed that
some of the peopleinitssample haVe
rather strange viewing habits. The
executive is quoted as telling about
one wealthy man. north of Chicago.
who developed an intense dislike for
the late Lyndon Johnson during his

presidency.

According to the executive. the
vieWcr would sit in front of his T.V.
set with a shotgun cradled in his lap.
and whenever the President
appeared on the tube to make an an—
nouncement. the set was immediate-
ly blasted apart.

Variety quotes the Nielsen official
as saying: “loward the end there.
when Johnson was using T.V. all the
time. we had a truck going out to his
place to wire a new set practically
every day.“

Nielsen said the man was kept on
because the company felt that eccen-
trics like other Americans. should be
a part of its sample audience.

the United States.

Jerome Hollander of the US
Customs Service conﬁrmed this -
week that NORAD‘s radar tracking
system was secretly pressed into ser-
vice against pot-smuggling airplanes

“beginning September 20th.

Hollander says that the new opera-
tion has been code-named “Opera-
tion Star Trek.“

NORAD was originally
developed to truck enemy bombers:
but customs ofﬁcials admit that
sophisticated tracking equipment at
Davrs-Monthan Air Force Base in
Arizona is now scanning for
marijuana-laden airplanes as well.

Oll'icials say that “Operation Star
Trek“ was supposed to be a secret.
but that they decided to conlirm its
details alter one plane which was
recently seized had a big sticker on it
saying: "Smile. you're on radar.“

Customs officials report that in its
first month alone. “Operation Star
Trek“ has resulted in the capture of
six airplanes. 28 arrested in-
divtduals. and the seizure of H.200
pounds of McXIcan grass.

NORAD tracking is just the
beginning of the military's entry
into the pot-smuggling war:
Customs officials also report they
have just signed a five-year agree-
ment With the US Coast Guard to
use radar systems on Coast Guard
cutters that patrol the coast of
California.

PHONE TURNOVER

A federal judge in New York has
blocked a new stutelnw which would
have required the telephone com-
pany to inform a customer if the
customer‘s phone records wure being
turned over to investigators.

The new low Would have per-
mitted the bills to be turned over'in
sccrcc)‘ in cases where a court
specifically suspended the disclosure
rcqwrcntcnt.

However. Federal Judge Lloyd
MacMuhon blocked the new law.
labeling it “an incredible encroach-
ment on law enforcement.“ The
telephone company stated in court
that it always surrenders customers‘
bills in secrecy when they are re-
quested by police agencies.

BIGGER BREASTS

A promoter ol'topless clubs in San
Francisco is claiming that acupunc-

crease the size of women's breasts.

1 he promoter‘s name is Davey

press conlcrcncc to proclaim his new
discovery.

Rosenberg introduced a dancer

“The New England Journal of
Medicine” is reporting that mari-
juana is far more effective than any
other drug in relieving the painful
side effects of cancer therapy.

Cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy often experience ﬁts
of vomiting and nausea. Thejournal
reports that a team of Harvard
Medical School researchers has
tested the effects of marijuana
agath a placebo drug in patients
suffering from a variety of cancers.

The team found that in I2 of IS
cases involving the use of marijuana.
there was at least a 50 percent reduc-
tion in vomiting and nausea. In ﬁve
cases in which pot was used. cancer
patients absolutely no nausea atall.

The doctors report. however. that
in all cases where the dummy drug
was used. there was no decrease in
the amount of vomiting or nausea
plaguing the cancer victim.

SPECIAL TRAINING

In the wake ofthc Watergate scan-
dal and revelations about illegal
political donations. the Internal
Revenue Servrcc has begun givmgits
examiners special instructions on
how to spot illegal corporate con-
tributions to politicians.

The Wall Sll'i'cr Journal reports
that new procedures are spelled out
in an "urgent" supplement dis-
tributed to IRS investigators.

The supplement tclls examiners
such things asto intervicwthc pilots
of private corporate planes to find
out what the llycrs might havelearn-
ed during flights: to tqu to past of-
l'iccrs of companies. particularly ol-
Iiccrs who have becnfircd. And to be
particularly watchlul of executive
travel expense accounts which list
stopovers in places with strict bank
secrecy. such as in Switzerland.

The plan for the two billion
super-agency was announced by
President Ford last month: btttltdld
not receive much press coverage
because it was released on thesame

day that Sara Jane Moore allegedly
took a pot shot at ythe president.

In a nutshell. the Energy In-
dependence Agency would funnel
billions of dollars of government -
money into a private agency that -
would be completely free of con-
gressional review. '

New Times reports that the plan is
primarily the brainchild of Doctor
Edward Teller. the sorcalled “Father
of the H-Bomb.” The magazine
describes it as “the old formula of
strip mining coal in the west. off-
shore drilling l'or oil. underground
‘in situ‘ blasting for shale and total
reliance for electric power on nuclear
reactors.“

Alan Greenspan. the chairman of
the President's Council of Economic
Advisors. has warned that turning
over the billions of dollars to private
energy companies “creates a large
potential for real and perceived cor-
rupt practices." ‘

According to New Titties. the plan
relies solely on developing new
energy supples. with no attempt at
all to conserve or cut the consump-
tion of energy.

New Titties says the supervenergy
agency be empowered to issue ex-
emptions on specific projects to in-
dividual energy corporations so that
they could by-pass normal public
hearing procedures before beginning
projects.

HOLY NUMBERS!
