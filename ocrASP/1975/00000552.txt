since Rafters charges 'no admission

problems. Originally. four clubs us-

gruduully disappeared.

Trouble in Sherwood Forest“:

sympntliies tend to lean more and more toward them

by Lon Levin

The unique aspect of Wht'" Things Were Rotten is
not its humor. but how the humor is displayed. In the
tigc oflivc uudicncc comedy shows. it has no choice but
to stand out. (By the way. it is rumored thitt till live
audience shows use the some people: old migrnnt
workch and shoc-pcddlcrs who are dopcd up and then
told when to laugh.) It is also one ofthcl'cw shows sct in
the post. MASH is onother example oi'a comedy using
canned laughter and having'thi: action occur before
modern times but thcthingthat sets MASH aside from
most TV comedies is that it is funny.

Thingsin Sherwood Forest were not its bad as thetitlc
implies. Robin Hood (Dick Guttticr) is the happy,
bright eyed, bushy tuilcd Ralph Niidcr of olden times.
He and his mcrry men tin: constantly thwurting the evil
Sheriff of Nottingham (chry Polic) from taking
advantage of thc inoii’cnsive little people of Sherwood
Forest and its suburbs. At least in these times. Robin's
RilldL‘l’S always win against the “milittiry-indttstriul
complex“ of thc Shcril'l of Noltinghuni.

Most episodes are simple block ilnd whitc drums of
good versus cvil huscd on today‘s licndlincs. Om: show
had Robin and the boys dcstroying ii doomsday
weapon. In it more rcccnt episode. ihcysiivcd Sltchood
Forest from being torn down in order to make rootn for
it high income housing development culled Sherwood
MendoWs. Uniorlunuicly. week after week ol'thc sumc
cvil figure hctitl gcls tedious, Although chry l’olic its
the Sherill and Richard Dimitri its his sidekick Bctram
are the two best characters. with Cilcll passing show my

because they always lose. Mel Brooks. the executch
produccr. should havc known better.

Usually. the basic plot of it Brooks creation is a
humorous idea in itself. The black sheriff in is white
wcstcrn town or the young descendant of Dr.
Frankenstein are funny plots from which jokes can be ’
gcncruicd. And. of course, Maxwell Smart. Agent of
Control. is pcrhitps his grcutcsl comic invention.

Wlu'n Things Wl'l't' Rut/0n locks the depth to be funny

Of course. "Rotten" hudto be a disappointment. The
