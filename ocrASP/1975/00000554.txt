This book could practically be called MOS!
‘ Cordwainer, Smith. The late Dr. Paul
linebarger did not Write a great deal under his
sF pseudonym. But what he did write is
superb. Here is an author who clearly believed
in quality as opposedto quantity, and was for-
tunate enough to have an independent source
of income. He neVer had to churn out inferior
material just to get a paycheck.

Smith's stories. like those of several other
SF writers, are interrelated. They must be read
together for full effect. as they make constant
reference to one another. Basically. Smith has
created a “future history" along the lines of
much of Heinlein‘s short story work. But the
resemblance is only thematic. Heinlein‘s
future is different from the present merely in
such externals as technology and political
situations. Smith's future is truly alien.

This alienness makes Smith‘s writing
somewhat difficult to relate to. Situations and
human reactions turn out to be not what the
reader is expecting. They are not ra ndom. but
simply unfamiliar. By the end of the book.

whole new patterns of society have been
presented. But not revealed. There is a cons-
tant dimension of mystery in Smith‘s work.
Many strange interludes are "explained" by
allusions to other episodes of the future
history which were never put intostories. Yet
the way these allusions are handled makes it
plain that the author wished to keep them
vague.

For Smith. mystery is part of the human
condition. Many of his stories revolve around
conflicts between social planners and those
who believe it is betterto keep mankind free of
control, free to forge ahead without rigidity.
Progress. whether social or artistic. comes
about in Smith's future only through painful
conllict and a shattering of the old order. And
yet there is an underlying pattern to the con-
ﬂict. Legends offuturc messiahs are fulfilled in
precise detail. People act out their parts in an-
cicnt stories ofthe coming revolutions. The es-
tablished order is blind. but the"pure of heart"
know the shapes of things to come.

As may be inferred from this last. Smith
often writes on the brink ofsentimentality. He
