To the Editor:

Being somewhat of s strangerto yourcoun-
try. and thus being somewhat ignorant of what
customs aresubseribed to by Americans. lwas
somewhat surprised (agreeably. I might‘add)
to find. an enclave on campus that promised
methejoys ofsocial intercourse. Having arriv-
ed from a cold climate. cursing the various
degrees of coldness in architecture and emo-
tion. I despaired of' ﬁnding any possibility of
human warmth here in the land of the South
Mall.

Mr. Editor. I needn't have despaired. I
found a building on campus that has welcom-
ed the to its bulky bosom. There. to be sure.
can be‘found an abundance of human warmth.
a party atmosphere far outshiningthe"levcc"

a Madison Ave. advertising house. and a bus-
tle and bustle that compares favourably to
that august nation of Woodstock. In this
building can be discovered every sort of inter-
course one would want at any particular mo-
ment. Talk'! You‘ve got it! Shouts? Why they
ring the halls! Singing. dancing. merriment‘!
Yes my editor. Yesl Why. I have even observed
the preludes to sexual excitement. and no
doubt (I am aghast and titilltited) the act of
procreation itself. in suitable areas(l am sure).

editor. this circus tent of humanity. my fellow
brother in writing. this coliseum of entertain-
ment. is'RIUHT HEREON CAMPUS!

How do I thank my new country. Mr.
Editor? This is my problem. Far be it for me
not to express my gratitude to my new home
for providing this abode of revelry. l have
seen' a few disgruntled remnants of
humankind in this building and I wonder at
their lack of discretion. Can they not find a
better place to look askance than at the

Base Values

To the Editor

I consider the letter "Heads: Whip Inﬂation
Now" (ASP. Thursday November 4). to be in
poor taste and a degradation of the Albany
Student Press and the student body at the
State University of New York at Albany.

The person who is responsible for writing
that letter shamelessly disrespects the fact that
possession and the sale of marijuana are
against the law. He (or she) addressed other
law breakers by means ofthe ASPi“I‘dlilreto
use your paper to talk to all those folks out
there who buy and smoke pot.“)

I am disappointed that the editors of the
paper allowed such a letter to be printed. That
letter insults mature. law abiding citizens and
demonstrated irresponsiblejournalism on the
part of the ASP. The obscene word at the end
of the letter is truly immoral and offensive. It
expresses low social and moral standards. The
standards of this newspaper reﬂect the stan-
dards ot' the university and I am upset that
those standards are very low.

Back to Banks-

To the Editor:

After my letter concerning campus bank
appeared in: your ASPof October 28. lreceiv-
ed a number of valuable comments on it.

Dr. Paul Ward. the international student
advisor of this university with whom l per-
sonally acquainted. for instance. kindly
remindcd my that the matter was discussed
three years ago. only to have been dismissed
due to the state regulation prohibiting such a
facility on campus.

A more comprehensive comment came
from Mr. E. Norbert Zahm. the General
Manager of FSA. In his personal letter ad-
dressed to me. Mr. Zahm cited two reasons for
its seeming impossibility.

Whether it be the state law or a resolution
by the Board. onething was clear. There exists
some kind of legal barrier prohibiting the ex-
tension ot' commercial bank facilities to' state
campuses.

Second reason was somewhat aman’ng.
Several banks in the area were askcdto reveal
their preferences for a campus branch. Sur-
prisingly enough. they showed only a
"minimal interest" to it.

Upon a careful re-reading of Mr. Zahm's
letter. however. I had to have adoubt whether
the matter was properly handled. The banks
showcd minimal interest. “mainly because
space does not currently exist andthey cannot
construct their own facilities on State proper-
ty.“ as the letter indicated.

It is fascrnaiing to see some basic concepts
in economics illuminate the problem and
suggest a solution.

Firstly. let us think about the legal barrier
problem. There must have been some grounds
for the imposition of such a restrictive regula-
tion. Maybc to protect university com-
munities from the perils of wild-cat bankrngof
thirties...

The first one is similar to that suggested by
Dr. Ward. a legal barrier problem. This time.
however. it was a resolution by the Board of
Trustees.

So let our university lawyer dig out them
and present to the university community.
Then we can evaluate whether the prohibitive
grounds are still valid or not.

We need to remembcrthe solemnfacttliat a
lot of legal grounds do change‘as time passes.
They either become obsolete or found out to
have been irrational from the beginning.
irrational in the sense that the community's
preferences were misrepresented in the legisla-
tion.

If we reach to the conclusion that such a
prohibition does not serve for the interests of
the university at all. the natural course of ac-
tion is obvious. Send our representatives to
the authorities concerned and ask for its
repeal. Let them know we need a bank on our
campus and we can take care of ourselves
without their legal intervention.

The problem ot'spacing needs more detailed
attention.

First. let us exclude the possibility of con-
structing a separate building by a bank on
campus from the list of feasible solutions. as it
is legally difficult and economically un-
justified (too much cost).

Instead. let us concentrate on ﬁnding a
proper space wrthin the campus center
building or its vrncinity. Location theory tells
us a batik should not bctoo farfromthe center
of community‘s activity.

No dotiht. it is not easy to find a proper
space. espectally at this time when the wltole
university is suffering from the spacing
prohlcm.

Whath need in such a situation isa carcful
review of cost-beneﬁt analysis on the use of
campus center spaces. We must evaluate net
bencltts accruing from alternative uses of
santc spaces and decide whether a campus
bank idea has such a low prioritythnt does not
justify any allocation of building spacesto it.

In economics Wt: call it the fortnation of a
community's utility function. Simply spcak-
ing. it refers to the process at gathering the
representatives of tltc university community
and discussing what would be the best usc of
campus ccrttcr spaces.

I would be glad if only the matter is being
aroused and discussed at the level of university
senate or appropriate councils in line with the
points indicated abow.

U N Goal . Displacement

The U nited Nation's adoption Monday night of three pro-Palestinian resolutions is
cause to look back and reassess the UN and its purpose. Were actions suchas thesethe
original intent of the UN? The three resolutions. the most significant of which equates

Zionism with racism. appear, as Israel claims. to be directed at her destruction. Infact,
it was the infant UN which saw fit to create Israel. ‘Any action contributing to the

destruction of Israel must be in contradiction to one of the major goals of the UN: to .

support the sovereignty of independent nations. ‘

The U N. created in I945 by the Allied forces. sought primarily to fosterinternational
peace while working to build an internaional machinery to promote cooperation
between nations. This premise is known as collective preventive diplomacy. i.e..trying
to solve a problem before it becomes unsolvable. But.ofcourse. it has prevented many
potentially major conﬂicts. I ' I

The UN's General Assembly theoretically operates on the principle of democracy.
This rule by the majority appears to have its own internal power structure. witness the
resolutions. Actions. however. can only be brought an approval of the Security
Council. Within the Security Council. the ﬁve major world powers can veto anything
counter to their respective national goals. The remaining majority in the General
Assembly is left merely to adopt resolutions. Thus. Monday night's resolutions. while
deplorable. are nevertheless impotent.

For their part the major powers are heavily involved in the development of political
trends within their satellite countries. This political inﬂuence might not be strong
enough to be labelled imperialism. as same claim. but be it left or right . it is evident.
Institution by a major power of an unsuitath alien political or economic system on
another system is not in the latter‘s best interest. and ultimately works against the
major powers themselves. ‘3’” i

It is because of this realpoli'tik. therefore. that the General Assembly is little more
than a forum where issues are presented. discussed and debatedlwithout consequence.
This in not inherently useless. There is always a need for communication. Even though
we disagree. with the most recent condemnation of Zionism. we must continue' to
recognize the need for debate and disagreement. Only through discussion can we avoid
the major confrontations we have experienced in the past.

The UN is ideally a collective associaion based on cooperation between individual
countries. Without these efforts. world diplomacy would suffer. Can the rhetorical
bureaucratic processes be expedited in order to fulfill the organization's original
intentions? Perhaps, but only if serious action is taken to eliminate the purely political
ambitions of its component nations.

Errata

In a front page article about student housing in-thc Albany Student Press of
Tuesday. November 4. it was mistakenly stated that a Mohawk Towar conversion
would now have to be postponed. This is not necessarily true. as Vice President for
Management and Planning John Hartley does have a limited amount of funds for
alterations.
