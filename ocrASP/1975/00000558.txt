’ I by Kohl-its

In‘ a defensive struggle. the Albany
State Rugby Club was tied by cross-
state rival Oswego. The game was
played under excellent Weather con-;

,ditions. and a crowd of more than

two hundred was on hand.
Oswego was in Albany‘s territory

most of the ﬁrst half. but couldn't

push the ball over. The scrufns of

each tearri battled each other overs ,‘
few yards of territory. before 0s- .
wego converted a penalty kick from '. ‘
30 yards out. The halftime score was '

Oswego 3. Albany 0.

The second half was much of the
same defensive struggle as the ﬁrst.
However. it was Albany on the
offensive as the ruggers found
themselves in Oswego territory most
of the second half. Like Oswego in
the ﬁrst half, the Albany scrum
couldn't push the ball over the goal
line.

“Oswego‘s serum was the best we
played all year. They played very
aggressively.“ said Coach Chuck
Rappazzo.

Albany got the break they needed
on a freak play. The ball was kicked
into Charlie Levine‘s chest. and he
ran forty yards for the score. P-ob
Goldberg kicked the two point con-
version, and Albany had a 6-3 lead.

Oswcgo drove downﬁeld and was
rewarded with another penalty kick.
Alter converting the thirty yarder.

‘Albany‘s most damaging miscues
resulted in four penalty kicksfor Os-
wego. two of which wereconverted.

“Since we couldn‘t get the ball to
our scrumbacks effectively. we
couldn't open up the game with
passes.“ said Rappazzo. “As a result.
when either team moved the ball. it
was because of an individual scrum-
man‘s effort."

Albany's serum was strengthened
by the return of Wences Rodriguez

’3 * little experience. .

r The thirteen woman team. con-
sisting of ten swimmers and three”
divers. had their ﬁrst taste of com-

' petition November 7. in a home

scrimmage against Williams

. College:

Although Williams won. 2l-l00.
the meet was still successful accor-
ding to Coach Leslie Hoar.

“We‘re a young team made up of
basically freshmen and sophomores.
they therefore laek experience on a
competitive level.“ said Hoar.
“These scrimmages will give them a
chance to gain that experience."

The meets consist of ﬁfteen events
with the option of long or short dis-
tance competition. The thirteen

' swimming events include: relays; the
freestyle; backstroke; butterfly; and
breaststroke; where each swimmer
can enter a maximum offourevents;
three other individual events; and
one relay. The divers have two
events. the one meter and three
meter. the latter being optional.



e ' \‘s'av.li\vr.' r.” mu 01-? s. so,

Eachjudge rates the divers on a scale .

of one-to-ten points.

',Seven points are awarded to the
winning relay team. lnthe individual
events. possible ﬁve points are
awarded to the first place entry.
three for second place. one for third.
if a team enters the event but does
not place they still must be awarded
one point. thereby keeping the op-
posing team from making a clean
sweep: nincpoints.

The women's swim team finished
with a 3-5 record last year. its three
returnees: Cathy Maloney, Wendy
Knoesz. and Margret Redinbaugh.
will combine with several new—
comers in hopes of building a strong
team for the future.

Colgate. Potsdam. and Bingham-
ton pose the toughest competition.
leaving Albany‘s team with a stiff
season ahead of them.

The highpoint of the season is the
NYSAW Swimming and Diving
Championships held in February at
Potsdam. Season veteran Margret
Redinbaugh ﬁnished 8th and 9th in

last year. Perhaps someone will ac-
company her there this time . . .

Perhaps the tide will turn.
