another sudden death situation. and
this time there is no fourth seed. no
ECAC Tournament. and no kiss or
handshake for the loser when
Albany travels. to Binghamton for
the first round of the NCAA Divi-
sion lll Tournament. Saturday, at l

p.m.

Brockport and Newark College of
Engineering meet in Newark. also at

The winners of the twa games will
meet by Nov. 22 for the Eastern
Regional Title. with the regional
winner advancing to the national
championships. Nov. 29-30 at

Albany‘s ﬁrst NCAA Tournament
game (1973) was also against
Binghamton. with Binghamton
coming to Albany and defeating the
Booters. 2-l. in sudden death double

overtime.

The Binghamton-Albany rivalry
heated up two years ago. when the
Booters downed the Colonials, 3-2.
in triple overtime to win the. I973
University Center (Tournament.

“Binghamton has a very disciplin-
ed. well coached squad which is con-
stantly improving." said Albany var-
sity soccer coach Bill Schieffelin..
“They entered the season as a young
team (only two seniors) and did not
expect to go as far as they have.
Their coach. Tim Schum. is extreme-
ly pleased with their progress."

And progress there has been. as
the Colonials finished their season
with a 10-3-2 record. including wins
versus nationally ranked Cornell (l-
0). Buffalo (3-2). Geneseo (2-0). and
Scranton (2-1).

The Colonials‘ losti against:

Seven members of the State Un-

team will compete Saturday in the
IC4A Championships in New York
City. They are senior Carlo
Cherubino;juniors Chris Burns and
Eric Jackson; sophomores Brian
Davis and Tom Ryan; and freshmen

Albany. which finished its dual
season with a 6-4 record for its l4th
straight winning year under coach
Bob Munsey. has been ranked—in
both New York State and
nationally—by a new cross-country
publication. The Hauler. The Great
Dance. in poll ofcoaches published
by the magazine. are rated eighth in
the state and 20th in the country.

Although the H snark wealthe
worst in Albany's 'proud crusa-
country listory. Munsey attributed

lttouventl factors. “This was the

toughest schedule we haveever had.”
he pointed out. “and we faced it with
an extremely young team and with
very little depth." The brightest
point ofthc fall wasthe performance
of Cherubino. who hopes to make
the Italian Olympic team next year.
He became the first Albany runner
to win the annual Albany In-
vitational. doingit in the fastest time
ever recorded by a Great Dane
runner on the home 5~mile course.
25:03.4. He was the leading Albany
runner all year.

The Danes ﬁnished ﬁfth in their
own invitational and second. forthe

second year in a row. in theSUNY.

won the ﬁrst Capital District Meet.

in games against mutual. op-
ponents. Binghamton has beaten Os-
wego 6-2 (Albany. 4-1); Geneseo
(Albany, 4-2); New Fall: 2-]
(Albany. 64); ties with Oneonta by
identical scores (2-2); and losses to
Brockport (Albany. 1-3). Bingham-
ton has beaten Buffalo. a team
Albany lost to. l-O.

“It should be a very even soccer
game." said Schiefl‘elin. “Certainly
the home-ﬁeld advantage will help
them. but inthistype of game. it's the
team that wants it more which wins.

- Fan support from Albany will be a

key—we need as many people as
possible to come down on those
buses.“

"We were very disappointed after
the UC Tournament because our
players wanted to play Bingham-
ton." Schieffelin continued. “We
thought we Were the better team.
There is only one way to prove this.
and that‘s beat them Saturday."

Albany goes into the game with a

healthy squad. excepting Arthur
Redford. still suffering from a leg in-
jury incurred in the Geneseo game.
and a questionable starter.

“To beat Binghamton we must
play good. hard. aggressive soccer.“
Schieffelin said. "I honestly believe
that if we play the brand of soccer
we're capable of playing we can beat
any team on our schedule."

“The key to Binghamton scoring
attack has been senior Steve
Springer." Schieffelin continued.
“but any of their players can put the

ball in the net. We know what we
have to do; its the doing it that
counts."

Schieffelin has numerous options
for a starting lineup. but several
positions seem certain: Henry
Obwald. coming off an outstanding
performance versus Brockport. will
be in the net: Ricardo Rose and Pepe
Aguilar will be two of Albany‘sthree
fullbacks (the third depends on Bed-
f ord's leg — if he‘s healthy. he is the
right fullback) if not. Mark Wenzel

Danes Head For Springﬁeld

by Craig Bell

The tenth-ranked Albany Great
Danes football team (6-2) travels to
Springfield. Massachusettes to bat-
tle the Springfield Chiefs in their
season ﬁnale this Saturday.

The Chiefs. 3-6 on the year. are
coming off a big upset victory over
Yankee Conference powerhouse.
University of New Hampshire. last
Saturday. Prior to last week's con-
test with the Chiefs. New Hampshire
was undefeated (7-0) and ranked se-

cond in Division II of the NCAA.

“Football is a great tradition at
Springfield.“ said Danes head coach
Bob Ford. “They have had years and
years of great teams. and have been
through many wars. In addition.
their head coach Ted Dunn is retir-
ing this year ‘after twenty-eight years
as head coach. and the team would
like nothing better than to send him
out a winner."

Ol'l'ensively. Springfield operates
out of the Pro I with quarterback

Pete Rios at the helm.

Rios, an excellent drop back
passer who also likes to mix it up
with a little play action. had com-
pleted 48 bf 105 passes this year for
603 yards and two touchdowns.

When Rios drops back to pass, he
will be looking for his split end Gary
Chittenden or ﬂanker Bill Glennon.

Chittenden leads the team in
receiving with 25 catches. good for
339 yards and one touchdown. while
