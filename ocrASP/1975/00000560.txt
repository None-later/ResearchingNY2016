Breslin: The  that ShbottIStralg “at 

by Michael Sena
' llegheny ﬂight number 920
arrived at gate four on
schedule at 5:44 pm. The
door to the landing area opened.
and twenty-five people walked
down the red-carpeted corridor to
the waiting area of Albany Air-
port. Businessmen in banker
suits, and wives anxious to be
reunited with their awaiting
husbands. scurried along the cor-
ridor. The travelers stopped
momentarily. glanced around the
airport. and continued on.

Jimmy Breslin was one of the
last to make his appearance.
Wearing a blue pin-stripped suit.
light blue shirt. red paisley tie. and
carrying a large black attache
case. Breslin made his way
towards Andy Mandel and Jeff
Serether from Speakers‘ Forum.
and me. The remaining people
from the airplane clung to the
novelist as he greeted us.

“Just finished your book last
night." a young man said.

The passengers shook his hand
and left. Jimmy Breslin. the
celebrity.seemed at ease with his
well-wishers. h

In Andy's green Pontiac
Tempest. Breslin put a

Scliimmelnick. an importedgg‘igarh

into his mouth. '

"Who‘s got a. match? Does
anyone?“

“No. I don't.“

Andy pushed his car lighter in.

“See if this works.“ he said.

We drove to the airport exit. and
Andy paid the parking ticket.

"Ask the fuckin‘ guy for one if
this don’t work.“ Breslin said.

Finally the lighter worked.
Breslin lit his cigar. and everyone
laughed.

"Entertainment goes over bigon
the campus.“ Andy said. “We're
supposed to book only speakers
but we started to book comedians.
We had Robert Klein...“

“He is good." Breslin blurted
emphatically. The sweet aroma of
his cigar filled the car as he in-
haled.

“He packed two shows in. When
you start to talk about things that
are too serious peoplejust don‘t go
out.“

"Why not?"

"I don‘t know."

"Klein. who else have you had?"
Breslin asked.

“Cicely ’l‘yson did a dramatic
performance."

“Kreskin did a. .
to say.

“How was he?"

"He was excellent." Andy said.

"One of the most amazing
speakers we've had was Jack
Anderson." I said. "He really
packed them in. He’s a real
character."

“What way is he a character?“
said Breslin. “I know him."

“He's very pompous."

“Ali. that's an act."

Breslin tried to relax during the
half-hour car ride. We were en-

route to the Hyatt House where a
room was reserved for him. At
eight o'clock that night on October
28th. he was to speak at the
SUN YA ballroom. But here in the
car. he played the role of the
typical journalist—the hero of
New York's blue collar workers.
The God damns. hells. for Christ
sakes. and fuckins. poured from
his mouth in-between long puffs
on his cigar and jokes about his
Irish drinking habits.

His wavy black hair had a grey
tint to it that doesn't show up on

television. Breslin has been
writing for years, and has two best
sellers: The Gang That Couldn't
Shoot Straight and How the Good
Guys Finally Won. The former is a
humorous fictional look at the
Mafia. “The average Mafia outi’it
consists often guys named Rocky
and a man named Sidney who
counts." the latter is about
Watergate. Breslin has also work-
ed on The New York Journal
Tribune. the New York Post, and
NBC news. After “hanging out at
construction sites for4-5 months."

ASPECTS

Breslin is presently writing
another book.  
Though basically a'novelist

now. Breslin still comes back to

daily. newspapers; Idid six weeks
this summer at The Washington
Star. A friend of mine owns the

paper there. I ran around the coun- .

try: Los Angeles. Chicago, Beaten.
Detroit. Philadelphia—places
like Miami. I might do that again.
whenever I finish this ' novel.
whenever the hell that is going to
be." .
By running around and hanging
out. Breslin felt he had to be there
when a story happened instead of
sitting back at his typewriters and
writing columns. By being onthe
scene he hoped to catch the
"emotions of real people." He thus
has been called a new journalist.
which is a label he rejects.

“New journalism is just some
catchw0rd that got coined by Tom
Wolfe. and really it's meaningless.
I mean. Truman Capote said he
wrote a non-fiction novel in his
book In Cold Blood, He invented
something new and he didn‘t want
anyone to know what it was. He
made up something so he would
look flashy in the press. They
printed it and he bullshitted them
all. Then Mailer wrote history is
the novel. the novel is history. I
mean writers do things to be
catchy so Wolfe came up with the
new journalism."

Journalists had gotten away
from hard reporting. he said. as he
slapped his hand across his face.
“They would run out and cover
something for an hour and come
back and write somethingin twen-
ty minutes." In the old days. he
reminisced. you used to take fif-
teen to sixteen hours a day to get a
column done.

Watergate. however. changed all
that. Bernstein and Woodward
from The Washington Post
“covered a burglary the way they
did in the days of The Front Page
and things like that. And they did
what would today be considered
new journalism. They worked at
covering a crime. They rang
doorbells at night—no one was do-
ing that. What the hell. the book I
did called How The Good Guys
Finally Won about the Watergate
break-in. the impeachment
summer—what the hell. that was
just long reporting—that‘s all it
was."

We pulled into the Hyatt House
at about 6:30.

“I want seine time to go over my
notes." said the novelist.

"We’ll pick you up at 7:30." said
Andy. “it's only a five minute
drive to the campus—you'll get
there in plenty of time."

"Fine. OK. We'll have a cup of
coffee before we go over."

Breslin slowly pulled himself
out of the car. He glanced'up at the
motel's facade. and made his way
to the entrance door. The stone-
colored smoke from his oigarleit a

. trail behind him.
