I like any doctor's office.
The waiting-living room 1
is homey. boarded by colorful
walls and a, rich. old-world
fireplace. All around are bright
posters'and booklets to entertdin

mosphere. one can not distinguish
the staff from the clients. for both
appear comfortable and at ease
with each other. '

This is the atmosphere which
pervades the Albany Planned
Parenthood Association on Lark
Street. The center is an affiliate of
Planned Parenthood/World Pop-
ulation which has chapters
throughout the world. The Albany
storefront has existed for over 40
years. Originally. the
organization's sole function was
to supply women with
diaphragms. Today. Planned
Parenthood deals with all aspects
of birth control. family planning.
and sexually related problems. It
has come along way.

Entering the reception area. I
first noticed a large pen and-ink
sketch of Margaret Sanger. an ear-
ly leader of American birth con-
trol. “No woman can call herself
free . . . until she can chooseto be
a mother." was the quote cap-
tioning the drawing. And this
seems to be the goal of Planned
Parenthood; to give women the
freedom to control their own
bodies and choose how they want
to structure their futures.

Downstairs. “Watch Your
Head." the library. clinic class.
counselor‘s office. and educator's
office are located. Kitty Reardon.
the educator. has been associated
with Albany Planned Parenthood
since June but her position of go-
ing out into the community to dis-
cuss preventive sexual education.
has existed for 11/2 years.

“We serve mostly unmarried
women. and of these. we serve
teens. from 15 through 19. more
than any other group." Ms. Rear-
don explained. "But then. we also
have 70 yearold women coming in
for cancer tests." Men also come
for information about sterilization
and for vasectomy referral and
couples frequently inquire at
Albany Planned Parenthood about
the causes of fertility problems.
"Any one. of any age or sex is
welcome here to use our services
and join our discussion groups."
Ms. Reardon said.

  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
 
 
  
   

The Planned Parenthood storefront is located in downtown Albany on Lark Street.

I had noticed that most of the
staff was composed of young
women. indistinguishable from
the patients. "A lot of young
women from the community do

work here.‘ Ms. Reardon said.
“Some are from the college com-

munity and they receive credit for

volunteer work." Others are paid
what the association can afford;
both groups receive vigorous
training before beginning their
jobs at Planned Parenthood.

“Payment for services is on a
sliding-fee scale." said Ms. Rear~
don. According to this policy.
clients pay what they can afford.
Medicaid patients can use their
medicaid cards to cover all
clinical charges. “No one is ever
turned away." Ms. Reardon ex-
plained.

In addition to low costs. the
clinic operates on a strictly con-
fidential basis. “We are not con-
cerned with names or addresses. If
someone comes in and says her
name is Susan Brown and wants
only telephone correspondence.
that's fine with us. We only need to
know her medical history.
Everything else is her own affair."
Ms. Reardon noted that any infor-
mation given to the clinic will not
be released to anyone regardless
of the client's age. This
encourages teenagers who are
reluctant to see doctors because
'they fear that their parents will be
informed of their sexual problems.
to visit the Planned Parenthood
clinic.

“The doctors here don't wear
their whites and both the staff and
the clients are on a first-name
basis." said Ms. Reardon. This
contributes to the relaxed. friendly
ambience of the center. In addi-

that the center is now operatng at

to return and new ones continue to

h. what can be more stately

and admirable to me than

mast-hemm'd Manhat-
tan?" wrote Walt Whitman in his
“Crossing Brooklyn Ferry."

In mid-town Manhattan. amid
the towering canyons of office
buildings. an old man dressed in
tatters stumbled into the street and
began beating the pavement with a
pair of drumsticks. never once
looking up at the cars passing
around him.

And here I was also pounding
the pavement. I was looking for a

job in the publishing husiness.

Allow me to introduce myself.
I‘m Dan F‘rinta. a May graduate of
SUNYA majoring in English.
Upon graduating an English ma-

jor has four options:

1. He can continue on in the
sheltered Cloisters of some
graduate studies program. hoping
it will lead somewhere.

2. He can try to get a job as an
English teacher in Australia or

the Ozarks. A hostile student
teaching program and the
hoodlums at Colonic Senior High

school saved me from this fate by

persuading me to drop out.

3. An English major may do well

to consider the publishingfield. In
times of economic expansion.
book publishers look kindly on us)

Unwor

 

 

 

bookworms.

4. The fourth. option is to do
something totally unrelated to
English. Like my summer Job as a
locker boy at John Boyd Thatcher
State Park.

I was resolved that my four
years of study would lead to a
career in book publishing.

Now New York City is the
capitol of book publishing and
that's where I decided to go. I have
a cousin. Jeanne. who lives in
Soho. just east of the Village. She
was kind enough to offer to put me
up for a few weeks. I was all set to
take a hunk out of the Big Apple.

My ﬁrst strategy was to get a
hold of the Sunday New York
Times Classified section. There
were listings for dozens of
editorial jobs. The catch was that
at least one year’s editing ex-
perience was required. I had run
into the Maginot line. the barrier
of “lack of experience."

It was the same story with all the
agencies that specialize in
publishing. They had no entry
level editorial secretary positions
open.

As a child I lived in New York
City and my best friend was
Joseph Gonzales. Joseph now
works for Doubledays as an
editorial assistant. An editor will
give a lot of his work to his assis-

tant. providing him with an ex-
cellent training in the field.

I looked Joseph up and he ex-
plained to me that getting a job in
publishing was a matter of con-
tacts. He called his own friends but
was unable to come up with
anything for me.

In the meantime. I called up

everybody I knew that worked in
publishing but was unable to come
up with any leads.
,,.Joseph told me that not only do
publishers like English majors.
but they like people with
bookstore experience. If you've
worked in a bookstore you know
what sells and what doesn‘t.

So I walked up Fifth Avenue in—
quiring at every bookstore. I fell in
love with ‘Ritzoli's with its
chandeliers and mellow classical
music. But no job.

I tried calling the publishers for
interviews. The voice at the other
end of the line would say. quite
sweetly. "I'm sorry we have no
positions available at this time.
However if you would like to send
us your resume. we would be hap-
py to keep it on file." I would hang
up and mimic into the receiver.
“This is a recording."

I decided on a frontal assault. I
chose the imposing McGraw-Hill
Building by Rockefeller Center.
The secretary in the personnel of-
fice told me to come back between
two and four. When I returned at
two-fifteen there were a dozen peo-
ple already waiting.

I started reading a pamphlet on
how to conduct oneself during an
interview. The secretary would
call three names every once in a
while. and three applicants would
be herded down the hall. Finally it
came our turn. the three youngest
and obviously the most inex-
perienced.

We were to speak to a Mrs.
George. 1 was the last and had to
wait five minutes for each of the
other applicants. I started leafing
through a book on student protest
that was conveniently laid beside
me on a table. I glanced up to see a

secretary watching me. Be aware
of an attempt to discover your

political leanings at almost any

interview.

ASPECTS

Mrs. George was in her late for-
ties. She had a voice that would
melt sugar. She began by telling
me that McGraw-Hill had no
beginning positions open. Thereis
no employee turnover in these
troubled times. However. an
attempt was being made to
process all applicants. Due to the
sheer volume of applicants com-
puterized files were being kept.
Would I be so kind as to respond to
these ten questions? _

I answered those questions. but
the whole idea of a computerized
interview bugged me and I made
the mistake of getting up to leave
before Mrs. George gave a signal
that the interview was over.

She looked up directly at me and
asked. “Why don‘t you think about
trying other places where
publishing goes on? Have you
thought about Boston?" I had a
sudden vivid recollection of an
episode several months before. I
was back in the personnel lounge
of Little Brown Co. in Boston. Per-
sonnel officers are invariably
women in their late forties. and
this one was rolling her eyes at
me. “I don‘t understand why you
picked Boston? Why don‘t you go
to New York?“

What it had all come down to was
that l was running short of funds‘.
and would have to findjust anyjob
in order to stay. I thought that with
my fluency in French and wide
traveling experience. I was a
cinch for atravel agency. It turned
out what one needed is "ticketing"
experience.

One day I wound up in the Holi-
day Temps Agency sitting next to
a girl who was twenty-five yet
looked closer to forty. She was
tired of being a topless dancer and
being forced to put out. If only she
could get a part-time job it would
help so much with the rent...

So now I‘m back in Albany. I
worked for a week at Herman's
World of Sporting Goods helping
out with their inventory. There is
an outside chance they may hire
me for the Christmas rush.

So what do you think Class of
"76‘? Are you going to throw in the
towel? Hell no. Give them Hell!
