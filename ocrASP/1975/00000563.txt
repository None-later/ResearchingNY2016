by Bill Hughes
I azarus is a pseudonym
for my friend. He was a
student at Albany State

'last semester. On May 27. 1975. he

was returning home in his car
and he went off the road‘ and
struck a tree. A car behind him
followed him off the road and
struck his Volkswagen pinning
Lazarus in the wreckage. His
neck broken and his spinal cord
severed. he will not walk again.

Today I saw him. He was cloth-
ed in white and was lying in a
hospital , bed. Lazarus was
emaciated and his cheeks were
sallow.

All the roads which lead from
Albany to the Nassau County
Medical Center seemed different.
The last time Lazarus and l
traveled them. it was spring. The
trees were green. flowers were
blooming; the world was
bursting with life. But that was
bei‘orethe summer. before the end
of the semester. before the acci-
dent.

Three days after the end of the
Spring semester. Lazarus was
returning home from a party
when his car veered off the road
into a tree. Another car, which
was following him. smashed into
the back of Lazarus‘ green
Volkswagen. pinning him in the
wreckage. It took hours for
fireman and police with wreck-
ing bars and welder's torches to
free him. Police on the scene
didn’t know whether to call for an
ambulance or a body bag.
Lazarus was delirous. screaming
“My legs. my legs" until he lost

consciousness. v ‘

From the beginning the
prognosis Was poor. Vertebraein
the neck were broken with exten-
sive damage to the spinal chord.
All motor ‘functions ceased.
There were also numerous
broken bones and internal in-
juries. An emergency
tracheotomy was performed so
Lazarus could breath. On impact.
the vertebrae smashed and
Lazarus began to choke on his
own bones.

He was put in the intensive
care unit in extremely critical
condition while his father paced.
his mother sobbed and the priest
mumbled prayers.

Like An Eternity

Weeksturnedinto months as he
lay in that cold. stone hospital.
He was hooked to a clear plastic
pipeline of intravenous feedings
and extractions.. blood plasma
and oxygen. He couldn’t move
and he was unable to speak. His
weight went from a solid- one
sixty-five to ninety pounds. His
skin was yellow. The pipeline
became his kitchen. bathroom
and his one link with life.

Day after day. his parents
would go to the hospital hoping
they might hear his voice or see a
flicker of movement in his hands
or feet.

Lazarus’ mother said, “Each

prayed. Prayer was the only
thing we could do." She prayed
that the nerves in the neck might
regenerate and he could‘ walk '
again. She's a cheerful woman
who smiled as shetold me of the
many different religious orders.
faith healers and minister she
wrote to. As she hung a relic of St.
Elizabeth Ann Seton on the wall.
I noticed she looked quite a lot
like Lazarus. He watched on
silently. smiling with his eyes.

Lazarus' father. also a
restaurant worker. took what he
considered a more practical
course.

"i left the prayin' to Mary and
took a few side jobs like mowing
lawns and gardening. It'll take a
lot of lawns to make that boy
well."

Lazarus has to be attended day
and night by a nurse who watches
his vital signs. give him medica-
tion and every half hour or so ex-
tracts phlegm from the large
opening in his throat.

In late August. Lazarus was
transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to a private room.
There was still paralysis but the
feeling in his hands had returned.

grips with life. He became
despondent and drew within
himself as he lay in that grey
hospital.

Today. i went to his room for a
visit. Asl walked down the hall!
heard a harmonica. It _ was a
sound I’d heard so many times
before. in Alden or in the
apartment on Garfield Place.
Lazarus was laying there with
his harp on a neck stand. His
mother was smiling. his sister
{was smiling and I felt a shit-
eating grin come to my face.

“Hey. what's happening."

“I got my harp back. It really
tires me out to play."

“Hey man. your wind will be
back."

It will be at least a year before
Lazarus leaves the hospital. The
leaves will all die and it will be
colder than hell in Albany. I‘ll go
back on those same roads as
Lazarus learns about living.
