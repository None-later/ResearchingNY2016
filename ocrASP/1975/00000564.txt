Besides their friendship, these
women have one thing in com—
mon: they’re gay. And willing to
share their experiences as
lesbians living in a primarily
straight world.

After struggling to open the
bottle of Almaden with no cor-

succeed with a potato peeler.
With a glass or wine for all. and a
cup of sassat‘ras teaforJoan. who
has a cold. our conversation
begins.

Martha: 1 almost quit myjob at
the day care center last week. One
of the women keeps harassing
me down there; I think she
suspects I'm gay. Well. the other
day she and her friend get me in
the gym (laughter) and said. ‘Do
you take the pill?~ I said ‘no' and
she said. ‘Well. what do you
take?’ ‘Nothing.’ She looked at
me. and at the other woman with
a knowing look as if to say. ‘What
I suspected is true.‘ I thought of a
million things to say later . . . If
they knew. forget it. I‘d be
blackballed. At school. I thought
I could tell everyone.

Nat-tbs: Sometimes it's a lot

better if they don‘t really know.
You can‘t say. ‘Listen. Mom Ind
Dad. I'm really gay.’

Joan: Like in the Radical los-
‘hian. you have to go tell your
parents right away or else you’re
hiding something. you‘re not a
liberated gay person. Your
parents just can‘t accept
something like that. On the other
hand. there‘s alot ofparts of your
life you can‘t share with your
parents and your co-workers.

Sara: Like it's not just
homosexuality; there's a lot of
things in your daily life that just
operate on this innuendo basis
all the time . . .

Martha: I haven‘t told my
parents: I don‘t think it’s
necessary. I have my grand—
mother — I think she knows. butl
don't think she wants me to come
right out and tell her. She really
loves Joan. We go over thereand
stay because she‘s alone so
much. We sleep in the same bed
and she doesn't say anything.

Joan: It‘s really convenient
there‘s only one bed available.

Sara: Sometimes the issue gets
forced as you get older andthey

tion in that my father is so ig-
norant ol' the subject — it'd be the
last thing he'd accuse me of. I-le‘d

going for me is that he feels you
can either get married and be a
mother or have a career — not
both. So even though he‘s disap-

Me: Mary. when did you ‘come

Mary: Last January. that's

backwards as everybody else.

Mary: It has a lot to do with
what job you're in. Being in
music. it's accepted there. In a
way I’m sort of lucky,I don't have
to be afraid to come out . . .

Sara: Being in literature. ver-
bal communication  you must
come to terms with it. The issue‘s
more likely to come up. especial-
ly if you're interested in
feminism.

We ran out of wine. but not con-
versation. as the subject became
children.

Sara: As far as a homosexual
raising a child. I think it‘s a good
thing. I don’tthink child-raising
should be restricted to heterosex-
uals.

Joan: Some lesbian mothers
have the kids from previous
marriages. Some are facingcourt
battles to keep them. I’ve heard of
at least one or two gay couples
who are living together and one
decides she wants to have a kid.
and they must find a suitable
male.

Mary: Is there a fear that
homosexuals will try to raise
their kids homosexuals?

Joan: They wouldn’t try. but it
might just happen. Courts think
that apparently.

Sara: And they afﬁlﬂ‘q'tliit‘m

Joan: I personally wouldn't
want to have any kids. If Martha
wanted to have a kid. well. we‘d
talk it over. I might help herout.

Martha: Well. if I wanted one. I
wouldn’t expect you to help me.

Joan: Well. I would want to.
You‘d have a. horrible life. just
taking care of a kid all the time.

Joan and Martha have been
close friends for two years. and

means when did I first realize I
was attracted to women.

Mary: When did you first call
yourself a lesbian?

Martha: Well. I was about eight.

Sara: You were not!

Martha: Listen. when I first
realized I was a lesbian I was 12.
It was a traumatic thing. For
years I had crushes on all these
women I went ‘to high school
with. I got into trouble in high
school; it came out thatI was gay
and I had — it was so awful — you
know how high school is. I denied
it. One time. one of the women I
liked got frightened and spread it
around the whole school that I
was lesbian. And someone wrote
on this very prominent bank.
right on the pillar. my name and
so-and-so is a lesbian. Well. it
was a crushing blow. I was 15
years old.and had to go there
another two years. My parents
found out, but I said. ‘Oh. it wasn't
true.‘ and they thought. ‘Oh. it's
probably just a phase you‘re go-
ing through.‘ I never got out of
that phase!

Joan: I think a lot of women
kind of suspect they might be
lesbians for quite a longtime. but
don't think of it in those terms.
Like back in high school. there

really liked. but I just never
thought of it. that I was a lesbian.
The boys I thought were stupid
and boring I was totally not into
that dating thing. There usually
comes somethingin your life that
lets you realize what you really
are. A woman I met in college
made me realize it was a
possibility . . .

Mary: It takes a lot. It took me a
year and a half.

Sara: Recently there's a lot of

moved in together over the
summer.

Me: Joan. Martha. you‘ve been
living together. as a couple. Are
you monogamous?

Joan: "Uh. we are: some
couples are. some aren’t. I sup-
pose it‘s a conscious decision.

Sara: I'm sure it pretty much
parallels heterosexual
relationships.

Breaking the Stereotype

Joan: It's important to know
that a lot of people don't carry out
the stereotype that gay people
never get together and live

together. that they're
promiscuous . . .

Me: When did you come out.
Martha?

Martha: Come out. Oh. God! It

support. Like when I came to
college. there was already the
Gay Alliance. and feminists were
beginning to consider the issue. I
had no problem about it at all.

Joan: Still. it's hard. You think
about a lot of wierd things. dumb
things . . . Like. people you tell
who were your friends say things
like. ‘What are you going to do
when you're old?‘ with no
children to support you.

Mary: Or they say it's because
you haven't met the right man
yet.

of mine. why would
straight women want to hang
around with gay men? He said —
because gay men treat women
with much more compassion 

Concerning straight women.
Mary had more to say.

Mary: . . . Last week. I came
out to these straight women at
school. They keep asking me all
these questions. and I'm getting
tired of having to answer them.
One of these kids is now treating
me with this whole thing;
everytime I talk to her. we talk
being gay ‘. . .'

Sara: [think she‘s really trying
to come to terms with it and you
should understand.

Mary: But I get reallytined. I-Ier
whole thing is that she looks
upon lesbianism as a purely sex-
ual thing.

Kate: She thinks we‘re after
her.

Mary: Before she knew I was
gay. if I put my arm around her or
touched her—nothing; it was
really nice. we were really good
friends. Now. if I put my arm on
her shoulder. she says. ‘Cut it out.
Mary.‘ She gets really uptight.
But we can laugh about It . . .
Straight women have to learn
some of the things they put gay
women through. Some straight
women feel really flattered. that

women have to understand who
lesbians are at. It's nctj‘uet'e

Kate: I don't think any women I 

can be purely 'eesuel. Not for
very long. , _

Joan: I think there's something
really nice ebcut the way women
are really emotional about one
another when you gettwc women
together.

Kate: Yes. it’s right on. It's
beautiful. . ‘

Joan: But then again. I've never
felt that way about a man.

Kate: In Colombia. I was with
men all the time. It was great dan-
cing. but all they ever want to do
is go to bed—“Why can't we love
each other. why can't we love
each other‘ . . .

Joan and Martha get up to
leave: “My parents are coming
tomorrow and I have to clean the
apartment." Kate. now that she
brought it up. is in the mood for
dancing. “You want to go to the

‘ bar?" “Sure.” I say.
Piling into her car. we drive

down Madison. “Straight ahead?"
asks Kate at the stoplight. “No.

gayly forward!" chant Mary and

Sara.
“That can be the title of your or-
ticle." Kate says. and laughs.
