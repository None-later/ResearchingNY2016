A Carey’s and the state
legislature's New York

City jigsaw puzzle are assembled.

it looks as if the federal govern-
ment will supply the missing
pieces.

Last week the legislature. called
into special session by the Gover-
nor. imposed a moratorium on the
payment of $1.6 billion in private-
ly held. short-term city notes that
will fall due between now and June
30th. .

Holders of the maturing notes
have two options. Although they
cannot redeem the notes for cash
as they come due. investors will be
able to convert the notes into 15 or
20 year Municipal Assistance Core
poration bonds at lower interest
rates than their currently held
notes. '

Investors deciding not to con-
vert to the long-term bonds must
still wait three years before they
see any return on the notes they
now hold. After three years. note
holders will receive their prin-
cipal and eight per cent interest in
effect until the implementation of
the moratorium. plus an ad-
ditional-three years of interest at a
reduced rate of six per cent.

According to MAC officials. the
purpose of lowering the interim
interest rate is to stimulate in-
vestors to convert to the long-term
MAC bonds. The Corporation was
created by the state in June to sell
the long-term bonds to banks and
private investors. and with the
money. retire the city‘s tax an-
ticipation notes. giving the city
the needed cash to pay salaries
and other expenses.

These city notes are issued in
anticipation of revenues—money
from seasonal real estate taxes.
for example. This practice of issu-
ing notes in anticipation of
revenues is used by most other

cities. v

The three-year moratorium is an
attempt to buy time. so that New
York City can eliminate the $3.3
billion accumulated budget-deficit

and balance its books as the ‘

legislature ordered. Mayor Beams
and 'state officials have started by
cutting 8800 million off this year's
budget. laying-off 13.000 city
employees. imposing further tax-
es. and using legitimate accoun-
ting procedures.

The last legislative special ses-
sion created the Emergency
Financial Control Board to give
the state direct input into the
restructing of the city's finances.

Mayor Beame and state leaders
hope these steps will restore con-
fidence by the banks in New York
so that they will again buy city
notes.

Counting 0n Ford

Governor Carey has
presumably received many
reassurances from President Ford

moratorium. Ford will consider
granting $2.5 billion in federal
loan guarantees. This money.

to the city and state.

By imposing a. moratorium on
short-term notes. some bankrupt-
cy lawyers have argued that the
city is technically defaulting on
its obligations. For everyone who
thinks the moratorium is a default.
there are others who disagree.
Governor Carey does not consider
the plan a default. citing a 1933
state law which imposed a
moratorium on mortgage
payments that was upheld by the
United States Supreme Court. City
and state officials freeze when this
plan is called a. default because

they fear that banks Will never
again consider the city or state

buy their notes.

 

As New York City faces default on December first, thisiswh

The state plan. which hinges on
the federal loan guarantee. seems
to be the climax of a mess that has
been growing for years. In trying
to explain why the city finds itself
near default. Ford and many other
government leaders have blamed
past city mayors and Beame for
fiscal mismanagement. For exam-
ple. even though there is a state
law which requires the city's
budget to be balanced. Wagner.
Lindsay. and even Beame have
found ways to get around it.

Wagner started the mismanage-
ment trend; when faced with a
budget deficit. he borrowed money
from banks to balance the books.
Lindsay and Beame have con-
tinued this trend by
overestimating anticipated
revenues and underestimating ex-
penses. borrowing money from
next year‘s revenues to balance
the current budget. and placing ex-
penditure items in the capital
budget.

This last practice. which has
raised hairs on the heads of many
state and city officials. involves
placing operating expenditures in
the construction budget.

For example. Economics
professor Donald Reeb explained.
suppose the city wanted a school
crossing guard. Thatis an expense
item. but by placing it in the con-
struction budget. the city's ex-
pense budget will be less than it
should be. Thus. the city can
finance more services than they
would ordinarily have been able

to. "This is somewhat dubious."
said Reeb. “but is it the fault of
wagner, Lindsay. and Beame for
using these practices. or state and
local taxpayers who don't want to
pay higher taxes for the services
they want. or of Ford and the
Fedoral Reserve Board and their
economic policies which are mak-
ing money tight."

Yet “mismanagement is hardly

Reeb explained. Willi the

these practices should end. But
most state officials believe the
real cause of New York‘s mnrhles'
is the loss of jobs.

Many believe that the fiscal
crisis began in 1969 when the
city's economy. which hnd been
growing rapidly. begun to Slll‘lllk.
Over the last six years. 501.800
people have lost jobs. This has

Department study. The Jul) losses

as garment-factory workers; 60.-

the legislature did yesterday.

The loss of these factoryjobs has
been particularly disruptive to the
city because factories supply
employment to the most recent
wave of immigrants—blacks and
Puerto Ricans. Since 1950. the
number of inner city blacks and
Hispanics has increased by two
million. As factory jobs decline.
more of these people are forced to
go on welfare. There are now one
million New Yorkers receiving
welfare. at a cost of a billion
dollars a year to the city.

Unemployment. many
sociologists believe. leads to
crime. This fear of street crime is
another reason for the business
decline. say state officials. Many
workers and professionals are
afraid to work nights and
weekends. Thus many companies
have decided to move out to the
suburbs or other parts of the coun-
try where they feel safer.

The state is currently in-
vestigating ways to draw
businesses back to New York. but
the fiscal crisis necessitates harsh
budget cuts. tax increases. the
Waylaying of the future for saving
the present.

For example. the city has
suspended construction on the
West Side Convention Center.
which was to promote the hotel.
restaurant. and tourist
industries—and create some 25.-
000 new jobs. Thus the city is in a
paradox: many projects that
Would more than recoup their in~
itial investment and create new
lobs will have to be abandoned
because the city just doesn't have
the initial seed money.

While this week with the new
state plan and the hope of federal
loan guarantees. New York City
will avert default. its problems are
far from resolved. The city and the
state must reverse the trend that
has seen 501.800 jobsleave the city
to savs the slumping giant.

As it Threatens; the; System

by Betty Stein

ew York City is ap-
N proaching bankruptcy. the

State‘s finances—
intricately connected to those of
the city—are teetering on the edge
of disaster. and the SUNY system
is headed for some devastating
cuts. . . or is it?

State University Chancellor
Ernest L. Boyer predicts drastic
cutbacks in the 1976-77 budget if
the financial situation worsens. In
a November 8 telegram to Presi-
dent F‘ord. the Chancellor warned
that the prospect of default by New
York City had.atthetime.“madeit
impossible to market top’rated
university bonds." This. he said.
would “result in needed facilities
remaining half-built. cuts in stu—
dent enrollment and massive
layol'l's of construction workers
throughout the state."

Boyer’s main concern then was
for the financially beleaguered
Housing Finance Agency (HFA).
which narrowly avoided default
on Friday when the legislature ap-
proved a last-minute $80 million
loan from various state special-
purpose funds. HFA is an agency
that sells moral obligation bonds.
which the state is bound to pay
more out of ethics than legality. It
borrows money for such things as
dormitories and classroom
facilities.

Investors Wary

ironically. SUNY construction
bonds. issued through HP‘A. have
always been considered a safe in-
vestment. But since a similar
agency (Urban Development Cor—
poration) almost defaulted last
March. investors have been hesi-
tant about buying construction
bonds. Now. in fact. the City's
fiscal crisis has caused investors
to become wary of putting money
into anything that bears the words
“New York."

Regardless of whether New
York City defaults. investors—
those who buy bonds—still do not
consider it a good risk. This lack of
confidence in the City soon

translates itself into lack of in-
vestor confidence. in the State.
making it impossible for the State
to sell the bonds necessary to pay
off its debts. The State budgetary
gap. estimated by Comptroller
Arthur Levitt to- be between $600
million and $700 million this fiscal
year. has caused Governor Hugh
L. Carey to propose massive
budget cuts to close it up. And this
is where the State University
system comes in.

SUNY is one of the largest items
in the State budget. Second only to
mental hygiene. its nearly $650
million allotment makes it a
prime target for some of the major
spending cuts that will soon have
to be made.

To tide the state over till the end
of the fiscal year. Carey proposed
a package on Thursday which. in
addition to $857 million in new
taxes and a freeze on all state
employees' wages. calls for a cut
of $600 million in spending.

Just how much of this $600
million will have to be coughed up
by SUNY is anyone's guess.
SUNYA‘s Vice President for
Management and Planning John
Hartley says that the cut is “likely
to be somewhat proportional." but
maintained that it was impossible
to cite figures. since the final
amount will be affected by so
many variables (i.e. the amount of
reductions in state aid to localities
and school districts. which may be
as much as five per cent).

in the event of massive cuts. said
Hartley. SUNYA “would not be
able to avoid staff reduction." Con-
tingency plans are now being
worked out. he says. which will in-
clude cuts in instruction.
departmental research. manage-
ment positions. and student ser—
vices.

Asked if any administrators
would be dropped. he said only.
“We've already reduced our ac-
counting department by one per-
son."

Hartley claims however that in-
struction will be considered as the
foremost priority. meaning that

ASPECTS

. ’r‘sduction‘s would be made in other .
areas first. “In any educational iii- '
stitution; you have to say _
priorities are in academic areas." ‘ r
he said.

Not everyone feels that the State
University system and its instruc-
tors will be as fairly dealt With.
Professor Bernard K. Johnpoll of
the political science department
calls SUNY “one of the prime
targets" of theimpsnding cuts.

“The university is the most
vulnerable part of the state." says
Johnpoll. “because it can be
argued that it‘s a less than
necessary expenditure. l disagree
that it should be . . . but I would
forecast a ten to fifteen percent
cutback within the next year."

Johnpoll foresees “serious cuts
in Ph.D programs in the
Humanities." and expects that
“the languages will be hit hard."
Because of the job market. he feels
that “there will be fewer cuts in the
sciences and fewer tenured peo-
ple." He also predicts bigger
classes and a smaller library ac-
quisition rate.

“I would favor heavy cuts in ad-
ministration." said Johnpoll. dis-
cussing the way he thinks things
should be handled. “lf99 percent of
all administrators were gotten rid
of. we'd have a better school . . .
but if i know bureaucrats. they‘ll
be cutting back on teachers. In
fact. they may hire administrators
to fire teachers."

At least one person foresees no
great changes in the SUNY system
as a result of the present money
situation. Dr. Donald ﬂesh of the
economics department claims
pat. default or no default. there
will be "very little effect . . . The
university isn't going to come up
missing."

Reeb does predict. however. that
there will be some further tighten-
ing as a result of the overly-rapid
growth that the university system
went through in the 1960's.

“There is very little loose money
around forthe faculty to introduce
new programs." said Reeb. “This
is probably the most significant
effect. Part-time enrollment
should expand. but we can't find
the money . . . the budget is just
too cut.“

Asked why Albany has in the
past been hardest hit of the univer-
sity centers in terms of budget
cuts. Reeb explained that this is
because of the "special
relationship between the people
here and the legislature."

SUNY Binghamton has State
Senate Majority Leader Warren M.
Anderson representing its dis-
trict. he explained. but “We [SU-
NYA] have never had a set of
elected local officials who've been
staunch supporters of Albany
State. It's that kind of . . .
relationship that is important."

But well-represented or not.
everyone in the SUNY system is
preparing for the storm ahead. We
have seen the lightning of New
York City’s fiscal woes. and are
now waiting for the thunder. What
remains to be seen is how loud the
crash will be.
