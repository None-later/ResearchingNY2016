his apparent full head of hair. He
hardly seemed the same man she
had passed by each night.

He was in the same field as her
lover. but had a much betterjob. It
would be poetically just to seduce
this man downstairs. To be
cuckholded by a professional
superior would be the only sure
way to short circuit her lover‘s
world of games and theories. his
electrical ivory tower.

She was careful not to betray her
slender pathos to the man

The phone rang.

What valid criticism could come
from someone so deserving of
these verses? Still. she did not
wipe away her tears. He was dis-
concerted by her silence. Why
didn't she say anything? He ex-
pected at least a perfunctory
defense. Her writing obviously
lacked both talent and direction;
and he found her devotion to it
depressing. There were so many
better ways she could spend her
time. But she should at least put up
a decent fight for it.

She changed the subject: “You
sound sick."

 

 

The key to the story was the man downstairs. He
was the perfect choice.

 

 

He was not. and returned to her
story. continuing his scorching
tones: “I made notes for you. The
first one is that you should always
doublespace.”

The conversation having con-

downetairs. He liked her and she
almost liked him. She tried not to
talk with him too long. in case he
might overly determine the
chiligacter of the thin man.

“But i did read it." he continued
finally.

“What did you think?"

“Actually. I found it depressing.
It seemed to say little more than,
that women just can't live without;
men." ’

Christ. she thought to herself.
that’s one sentence I won't have

the thin man say.

“I.” she answered. “Was actually
much more interested in what she
had to say about writing.“

“You’re obviously a much
more sophisticated reader than
me."

1. she silently corrected. She
smiled and continued aloud: “The
meaning is contained in the struc-
ture."

He appeared lost and began to
anxiously read the back cover of
the book.

She rose to leave: “But there are
things that don‘t work right in

feel lost. Perhaps she had stayed
with him: too- long.. Homeoqvered;

Even as she mounted the steps to
her own apartment. she began to
plan D.‘s encounter with the thin
man. 0.. she decided. would go
down to the thin man. bringing
along a few bags of herbal tea.
soothing yellow flowers in a
silken bag, a mild tranquilizer
that would serve as an
aphrodisiac.

A fire burned across from them.
playing red and gold upon their
straining bodies. Setting the cups
down closer after each sip. cross-
ing and uncrossing their legs.
hoping they might twine. the two
drew closer. He looked up. finally
abandoning the evasion of unmet
eyes and coyly approaching
bodies. She met his gaze. holding
him away for several seconds.
And then. she smiled. Abandoning
the touching cups. they lay
together.

There was definitely a
simultaneous orgasm in sight for
D. and the thin man.

Dotty could go no further and
abandoned the new story to read
over her lover's comments on the
last one. The first one that caught
her eye said: “You owe me $10 for
reading this."

But the comments did not stop
her from going to his apartment
the following night. After dinner.
after the local news. the national
news and his beloved Truth of
Consequences. they went into the
bedroom. '

She fumbled over her clothing.

“But I thought you were ex-
cited."

“When.” she answered absent-
mindedly. He was pulling off her
socks.

“During Bob Barker.”

"Oh. I am.- I am." she assured
him feebly. _

Finally naked. they began to
push against each other blindly.
The lights were out. but the televi-
sion was still going in the
living room A

The thin grey blare penetrated
the dark room. She could hear peo-
ple moving about downstairs. For
a. moment she thought she was at
home. and that the sounds were
those of the thin man.

Come up. she called silently.
And for a moment the man
downstairs lay beside her. If this
works. she thought to herself. I
won‘t have to write that damned
story. With closed eyes she smiled
at the fantasy of the man
downstairs.

“Do you want me to touch you
some more?"

That was definitely notthe voice
she wanted to hear.

"it's all right." she mumbled.
"I‘m ready.“ She stretched out
resignedly.

“Do you want me to get on top?“
She opened her eyes and saw her
lover‘s smiling face above her. As
her eyes adjusted to the dark. he
became almost luminuous.

She closed her eyes and again
conjured the man downstairs. But
the body upon her was too solid.
too solid to belong to anyone ex-
cept her lover. Sheicouldn’t hold
the fantasy. She would definitely;
have to write the story.

When he was done, he rolled
beside her: “Do you want me to.
touch you some more?" She was
mopping up the semen with a
kleenex.

“No. it was good."

“Good for what, you liar." he
laughed. and then continued in
more tender tones: “Is something
bothering you?"

"Not really."

“is it that story I didn't like?"

This time she laughed.

"Did you read my comments?"

“I didn't like them."

"Did you bring the story with
you?"

"Yeah."

“Why don't you go get it and we
can go over it.“

She grabbed his bathrobe and
went into the other room. picked
up the story. turned off the televi-
sion —-

“l-ley. leave it on."

She ignored him and returned to
the bedroom. He opened the lights
and perused the several sheets.

"It just goes too fast." he began.
reading from his notes.

“The sense of movement ap-
propriately corresponds to the
plot." she snapped.

“You‘re writing from as far
away as the moon."

“Authorial intention of separa-
tion from characters.“

"Well the road to hell is paved
with good intentions."

She laughed nervously. Christ.
she must have memorized the
responses. he thought. She was
taking herself far too seriously.
He began again:

She thought. two points for me.
But he stabbed again: “About the
only color you didn't use was pur-
ple. .
