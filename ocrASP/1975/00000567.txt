memorized the phrases he had

respond verbally to such
criticism. She would not denigrate
herself to discuss her writingwith
such a man. And she would cer-
tainly not have made love to him.

But then again. if D. had the
sense not to love and respect a man
such as her lover. what would
drive D. to approach the thin man.

so needed through her? Dotty felt .

After letting down the interview
with her own lover. Dotty‘ skipped
to the scene whereD. and the thin
man lay together. But even as she
grasped the pen. the head of her

,, own lover appeared in her lap. She

could feel his coarse blond hair on
her thighs. and in his glasses she
could see her own adoring expres-
sion twice reflected. He was in-
escapable.

Damn him, he was truly inescaple.

All right then; she fought. you win. my sweet baby.
She would put. off the sex far now and think about

As she struggled through the
scene. first in her imagination and
then on paper. her lover infected
the thin man. thickening his body
and fading his tan to a luminous
pale. The thin man's dark eyes
grew startling blue, he sprouted
the familiar bright mustache and
his hair grew thick. blond and
coarse until Dotty‘s lover lay in
the arms of D.

ty remembered that every one
before him had been thin. as thin
as the thin man; but in her rejec-
tion of them. their flesh. their
smell. their sweetness had es-
caped her. Only a skeleton of
names. professions and birthdates
remained.

But she could always go
downstairs and play out the scene.
The man downstairs was waiting.
even if she were a little messy in-
side. Yet if she did. she feared —

she knew — that her own lover
would block him as athick cloud

downstairs would immedihtely‘
become part of the past. as inap-

proachable a memory as all to be
so badly used by her. He didn't
deserve to be a phantom in an un-
successful fantasy, a skeleton in a
poorly written story.

All right then. she thought. you
win. my sweet baby. She would put
off the sex for now and think out
what would happen afterwards.
What would the thin men think of
D. ? And then again. thought Dotty.
what didthe man downstairs think
of her? She wondered if he listened
to her moving through the house
as she listened to him. "

Damn it. thought Dotty, here'l am.

story. and I don't even know what
:it’s about. How can I endow a
character with reality. much less
feelings and desires when my own
emotions drive me only to the
destructive act of adultery with a
leaky pen? She wished she hadn't
spoken so long with the man
downstairs. He had become too
real. V
D. would have to change. she
decided. D. as merely adiminutive
form of Dotty wasn‘t very plausi-
ble. D.. perhaps. was making the
first steps to leave her lover. But
then again. D.'s lover might in fact
altogether disappear. D.. single
and lonely. had come to love the
thin man from living above him.

as he walked to his car.

D. was a woman in love with a
spectre. the image of a man sitting
by a window. his comforting. lone-
1y presence below her. the smell of
his dinner. the clatter of his dishes.
And because of this intimacy.he
loved her as well. when they final-
ly. necessarily met.

There was no need for a fire. His
body was warm enough. with
currents running through it mak-
ing places as pleasant to lingerin
as warm springs in a lake. They
were both frightened. by the huge
creaking house. and their mutual
knowledge of that fright. He clung
to her. kissing her neck. her
shoulders. her breasts. Her head
swung back like a dizzy crazed

expecting nothing; ' expecting
everything.

He slipped inside her easily. His
glasses lay cool and watery on her
forehead. She could feel the profile
of his body on her like a gentle
knife. slicing through the callous-
ed outerskin of loneliness to
reveal a sadness and desire of a
different sort. He grew small in-
side her. Neither of them would
come tonight: but still. their bodies
clung together through emotions
that both drowned them and
refreshed them.

"Let me love you.D..“ he said.

Or D. could say thatjust as well.
thought Dotty. She was pleased.
Everything previous to the just-
imagined scene she could junk.

“Your office." he broke in. "You

is broken. At any rate. she was
selling little American flag pins.
She said she was doing it to com

"That's just like you. innac-

wouldn‘t be selling them in." he
hesitated. "Your office to combat
communism on campus. With
your kind of mind you'd never
make it in my field."

“But that‘s one of the major
points of the story. Why was she
selling flags in an insurance office
in order to combat communism in
college? Well. I told her right off
that I certainly hadn‘t seen any
