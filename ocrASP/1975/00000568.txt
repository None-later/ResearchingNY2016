at the ceiling. he raised a plastic
bottle above his open mouth. A
light squeeze with outstretched
hands and a stream of rose colored
fluid fell a foot through the air to
its target. '

The crowd had gathered at the
Albany Palace Theater to hear the
New Riders of the Purple Sage.
Taped music played through the
house speakers. Up on stage, the
road crew scurried about. running
wires across the floor and twisting

microphones into position.JOthers ,

The eight o‘clock starting-time
long gone. I watched people win-
ding their way amongst the long
rows of Seats. visiting neighbors.
grubbing cigarettes. sharing
wine.

Anticipation evolved soon into
aggravation. People voiced their
protest of the late start during the
pauses ' between taped songs.
Shouts grew in number and inten-
sity as song after song started and
finished.

“Hey Marmaduke!" screamed
someone from the balcony above
me. Chants of “Bring out the
Riders" stirred amongst the

crowd. it was almost nine o’clock.

I looked to my right. The man.

with the plastic bottle twisted the
cap off cf it. Lifting the bottle to his
lips.~ he guaaled the liquid quickly
through the open top. He seemed
content.

It was more than an hour past
the scheduled starting time. Even
those who were once reticent
chimed 'in. yelling and booing. A
guy stood up behind me. “Hey
c‘mon," he screamed. “I‘ve got to
go to work tomorrow!"

I glanced down the aisle at the
man with the bottle. He was busy
caving in the sides of the plastic
container with his nervously
fidgeting fingertips. He sat
straight up. glaring at the stage.

.Finally the lights went out. The
taped music stopped playing.
Jeers turned into applause. An an.
nouncer’s voice came over the

loudspeakers: “The New Riders.
have brought along some friends
.please -

to entertain you. .
welcome Dave Nelson and the
Good Old Boys." The three-piece
band. banjo. acoustic guitar. and
mandolin. began a dynamic set of
country tunes.

But the concert goers hadn't
come to see them. Manners were
cast aside. Intermittent pleas for
the appearance of the New Riders
persisted during their perfor-
mance.

assured the crowd that the main
attraction would be on soon.

Cosmic Zoom

The Good Old Boys exited and
the taped' music returned. The
house lights burned again. My
light-shy eyes squinted at the
reappearing road crew. They
began rearranging equipment.
The crowd was frustrated.

Suddenly the stage curtains
were drawn up. A large white
screen was lowered. A fellow sit-

we’re gonna see a fuckin' movie."
He was amused. Then the lights
dimmed and a countdown flashed
up on the screen. The joker sitting
next to me looked on. He wasn't
laughing anymore.

The audience was being treated
to some sort of filmic foreplay
called "Cosmic Zoom." “What is
this crap?" inquired my neighbor.
I replied that I had no idea.

But cosmic it 'was indeed. We

to a sea of prdtoplasm and cells.
Then we cosmically zoomed back
out to the boy.

The animation was good. It was
all very cosmic. but not at all tan-
talizing. People had come to see a
concert.

At 9:40 the lights went out forthe
last time. After some brief an-
nouncements the stage went
black. The waiting had finally end-
ed. Out of the dark came a voice:
“Ladies and gentlemen. would you
please welcome with me. the New
Riders of the Purple Sage!" Red
lights flooded the stage as the

crowd roared. Buddy Cage picked
the opening notes of "Panama
Red" on pedal steel guitar. People
jumped up. clapping their hands
high over their heads. After more
than two years. the NeW‘Riders
had returned to the Palace.
Old Fans, New Riders
They played the songs that had
made New Riders fans New Riders
fans. They sang about “L.A. Cow-

Women" and “Armadillo Blues."

Cage picked skillfully at the
pedal steel guitar. though his ef-
forts were distorted by an inade-
quate sound system. Bassist Skip
Battin, guitarist David Nelson.
and drummer Spencer Dryden
filled out the rest of the band.
Together they were producing the
country rock music that had
brought them fame.

Midway 'through the perfor9

mance I noticed two extra
microphones set up on the right
side of the stage. I was wondering
what they were for. Ididn‘t wonder
long.

“We brought along a couple
friends to help us do this next
song." Dawson told the crowd.
Two young ladies appeared on
stage.

“Oh Christ." chuckled my
neighbor. “here come the chorus
girls."

Performing “Take A Letter
Maria." the ladies supported Daw-
son's lead vocals with "whoa.
whoa. whoas" on the verses and
stretched out “Marias” on the
chorus. They jumped around the
stage under the pretense of dan-
cing. Theyvclattered tambourines

and waved maracas. They didn't

style. . '

The sound of the early Riders
was lost. While clinging to the old.
they were sneaking in the new.
The latter was disappointing.
Most of it was unoriginal. Little of
it represented the group's talent.

The Riders said goodnight to the
crowd and left the stage. “I'm piss-
ed." grumbled my neighbor. “They
«wasted so much time playing that
crap. And where‘d they get those
chicks?"

I wondered if the old fans of the
early seventies would accept the'
new New Riders of the Purple
Sage.

The crowd waved lit matches in
the air urging the Riders to return.
They did. Bunched at the foot of the
orchestra pit. the people frolicked
with the music.

The Riders left again. and were
called back again. Returning for
the second encore , Buddy Cage
strode past his pedal steel guitar
and approached a microphone.
“We like Albany better than
Syracuse,“ he proclaimed.
"Reallyl" The cheers made it seem
evident that Albany had not lost
its love for them.
