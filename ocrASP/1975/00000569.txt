NOVEMBER, 1975

 IngmatBofgm" 

byAtlll ‘
‘ t fifty-seven. with more
A than thirty feature films

behind him. director

‘ Ingmar Bergman is still breaking
_ new ground. First adapted for

Swedish television. his latest film.
The Magic » Flute. was a huge
success in Sweden and a sensation

. _,at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival.
It is scheduled to open in the U.S.
: in November.. "

Bergman was twelve years old
when he first saw the Mozart opera
at Stockholm‘s Lyric Theater—it
was love at first sight. “This opera
has fascinated me all my life." he
said. “My first theater was a little
marionettes' castle. I decided to

stage The Magic Flute there but I -

didn’t have enough money to buy
all of the score's seventy-eight
records. I hadto give up that ldetl."
» Some three years ago Bergman
confided his paSsion for the
Mozart opera to Magnus
Enhorning. the head of the music
department at the Swedish radio-
television network. Enhorning
suggested making a film of it.
Excited by the idea. the Swedish
network decided to produce the
film. Bergman would have about
$70,000 at his disposal. Thus was
born Bergman's Magic Flute. the
realization ol'a.forty-i'ivc—ycaiuold
dream.

During eighteen months of
preparation and fifty days of
shooting the director faced some
daunting challenges. The Opera is
rich in symbols and intricately
plotted. When it was first
performed two hundred years ago
the public couldn‘t fathom it.
Bergman eliminated several
passages and reversed some
scenes to make the work more
accessible. He sees ’I‘he Flute as a
contemporary drama: estranged
parents tear each other apart.
Each wants to protect his daughter
from the influences of the other.

Bergman had solved problem of
content but what of form? Was it to
be a film-opera? A l'ilmod opora‘.J
Where would he find his singers?
The great voices of the century are
seldom found in sylphliko bodies.
Should the preference be given to
the eye or to the ear? Those were
lust a few of the problems posed in
adapting an opera to the screen.

Bergman chose to attempt the
impossible: fitting the voices to
the character's faces. “We needed
young people." he said. “who
could appear practically without
makeup. so that they seemed very
close to us. They had to be gifted
actors as well as singers. They had

to be warm. real. and able to sing
like angels."

In November. 1972. while he
worked at adapting the opera a
team of four people armed with
camera and tape recorder scoured
Scandinavia in search of such rare
birds. At the head of the team was
Kerstin Forsmark. a voice teacher
who has worked with Bergman for
years.

Bergman didn't want to choose
from still photos so he had the
candidates filmed. hair pulled
back. without makeup. plain
enough for a police file. “In each
city."_ Kerstin Forsmark
explained. "we went to the opera
house and assembled the singers.
At first they were chosen for their
age. their physical appearance.
Next they were asked to sing. If
their gestures were too
conventional—exaggerated
contortions and hands on their
hearts~they were ruled out."

A hundred thirty candidates
were filmed and recorded. From
these Bergman and conductor Eric
Ericson made final choices over a
year. The same process was used
for the peast walk-on part.
Hundreds of children were also

quit. Went to the Army. Thought]
was gonna walk around awhile
when I got out of tllé Army. but it
didn't feel right looking at other
people working. I love horses.
This here puts you in mind of the
Army. I‘m never lonesome.
Always can get a dollar. Outside
the track I couldn't get a, quarter.
Would I like more money? Hell.

Was in a garage there five years.
Worked at night so much I got
tired. Quit that. Went to Atlantic

Wont back to Carolina and started
working with horses. Personally I
didn't like it in the beginning. Man
in the Army told me the way to
catch on is to stand around and
look. Stood there and looked for a
while and couldn't stand still."

More Like a Business

“What you talk about? Won from

“Not yesterday. You the biggest

In November. 1973. Bergman
decided to dub the singers' voices
after the filming to obtain the best
musical quality. They would sing
in Swedish. For five days
Bergman and his performers

the text and the music in minute
detail. Bergman narrated.

imagination. ’l‘hen rehearsals
with the orchestra started.
Bergman attended. constantly
refining his ideas. Kerstin
Forsmark had each singer work
with a tape recorder to make the
words of the libretto clearly
intelligible. The recording work
took six months.

In April. 197 “shooting began.
Bergman had chosen his setting
long beforehand. “The Magic
Flute." he said. “is placed and will
always be placed within the
intimate setting of an 18th century
theater." He converted into a
studio the auditorium of the little
theater of Drottingham. built in
the eighteenth century by Gustave

IllofSwedenJ'ven'th'e H g
were deliberately chose
Bergman invited groups 0
students and choirs and filmed
them as “they listened. The»:
enraptured by 'the music were
hired. '

Though the voices were dubbed '-
in later each character on the
screen sings his own role. with one
exception: the twelve Masonic
high priests. “We needed beautiful
chiseled faces." said Kerstin
Forsmark. “We chose twelve old
singers from the Stockholm
Opera, but we recorded young
voices."

“Shooting was difficult."
Bergman recalled. "with all those
dragons. magic tricks. and
changes of scenery." As always he
was a perfectionist: the,snowfall,
for example. and the ascent of a
balloon had to follow the rhythm
of the music. “Mozart was alive in
the studio. That elated us." he said.

After a month and a half of
editing. Bergman completed the
film. It was the most rewarding
production experience of his life.
For the public it .is one more
reason to love Bergman and
Mozart.

No Education

“Who's ?" Frank asks. "Where
does he tend bar?"

"I'll say one thing." The Little
Wizard says. "I wouldn't give up
the racetrack. I worked in afaotory
once. They put a chisel in this hand
and a hammer in this one. I swung
but I kept missing. No education.
That‘s my biggest fault. That's the
reason most of us come back—lack
of education."

"I quit and went to mechanic

"One thing about a racetrack. If
you feel you‘re being loused up.
you can walk off. Only thingis that
you can't better yourself. We‘re
way underpaid for the chances we
take. the skill. the work."

“Ah. you‘re a dedicated
racetracker."

“We racetrackers always want
to go home and punch the old lady
in the mouth."

“You might hear me griping. but
it‘s still the greatest sport out-
doors."

“Nobody ever gets the truth
about the racetrack." says The Lit-
tle Wizard. “What do you see inthe
movies. Mickey Rooney!"

They leave as they came. one by

read poetry." says Carmine. “I had
quite an audience yesterday."

My First Horse

"Did I ever tell you about the
first horse I bought. Frank?" asks
The Big One. “The man said. ‘Now
this horse don‘t look too good.‘ I
couldn't see anything wrong with
him so I bid $37 and bought him. I
took him home and found out he
was blind so I took him back. ‘I told
you that horse don’t look too good'
the man told me."

“Come on. girl. where you
going? Hold it. girl. Hold still
before I get mad. Where you going.
Brooklyn? You stop that!"

"Come on. you may look funny
but you're not funny. So stop look-

‘stop it!"

“I had a good time way down in
