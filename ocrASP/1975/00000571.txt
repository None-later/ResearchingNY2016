It is 0 in the morning at Barn 220

are in the stalls talking to the
horses. shaking out the straw.

January, is a groom. He does not
know why he is called January.

you come on the racetrack." he

works a 42 hour week caring for
ten horses and their stalls. He has
four children. “That‘s why I ain't
got no money." he says. “Only
things I never had was no money
and no car." January is leery of
cars. Once. when he was 18. his
employer sent him for the papers.
He was reading the dope as he
drove back. “I was sideswiped." he
says. ruefully. “I was scared four
or five days. I wasn‘t doing no bet-
ting then either."

“This is a pretty good game.”
January says. “Nothing wrong
with this job. Ain't nothing to it if
you start on time. Everything all
right. I've fooled around. Now this
is a little easier than fooling with
polo ponies. which I did. War shot
that polo racket." January was
born in Warren County. Va. "I
don't know the town." he says.
“They got counties there." He was
raised in Red Bank. NJ. "I worked
all kinds of farms in Jersey to
make a little spending money. I
worked in a defense plant. This
here job is more exciting. It's not
demeaning."

“Only way to get along with a
horse is find out if they mean or
just roguish. That’s the little
secret. A horse like music. you
know. Most generally a horse like
the radio. This is a good game. a
good game. real good game. A
GOOD game."

world has done him an injustice."
Richard says. “A man is what he
makes it. The world don't owe me
anything: Just a small chance. I'll
make it. I’m always looking for
something else. One of the advan-
tages the racing game has is the

Carmine was born in Brooklyn.
His father had a butcher shop near

Carmine began walking hotsthere

Humanities Division Diminishes

by Daniel Gaines

According to sources in the ad-
ministration and faculty, ap-
proximately eight teaching positions
will be taken awayfrcmlhe Division
of Humanities next year.'Twenty-
three faculty lines. including these
eight, will be allocated to the Divi-
slon of Social and Behavioral
Sciences and the Schools of
Business. Education. Criminal
Justice. Public Affairs and Social
Welfare.

These sources said that in
separate letters sent from Executive
and Academic Affairs Vice Presi-
dent Phillip Sirotkin to school and
division deans the exact nature of
the suggested cuts were revealed.
Sirolkin declined however to specify

just what suggestions were made.
Speciﬁc recommendations were
made “in some cases. not all” accor-
ding to Sirotkin‘s assistant David
Martin.

Sirotkin said the fetter would in-
form lhe deans who! they can expect
to lose or gain after faculty contracts

The Resource Allocation Com-
millec of the University Senate's

were informed of the plans.

chairperson. John Spulck. who also
heads the German departman "We
hope we can effect the thrust or
nature of [he rcpon." said Spulck.
adding that he didn‘t think the
decisions would change.

Athletes Allowed Representation

by Stephen Dzinanka

Sludcnl outrage prompted Cen-
lrnl Council Wednesday night to
reverse its previous stand
prohibiting athletes from serving on
the committee controlling monies
funding intercollegiate sports.

“They [Council] didn‘t realize
people would be upset." commented
SA Vice President Rick Mccklcr.

Three student-athletes challenged
the prohibition in an SA Supreme
Court case heard last week. They
claimed il was unconstitutional
“discrimination.”

Representing the plaintiffs in the
case. Bill Duker of the SA Legal
Commission argued. “One group of
students was singled cub—the
ulhlcles. No other groups are singled
out like this. that‘s why we have dis-
crimination here."

SA President Andy Iinuman.
representing SA. countered. “The
[SA] Constitution does allow for dis-
crimination if there is a good reason.
Thai is. a general conflict of interest
at all times."

The Court ruled that the
membership restriction was con-
stitutional if applied to non-Council
members. The Coun reasoned that
the restriction does not hamper st u-

In the state Supreme Court suit in-

Earlier this month. Council voted
to take the suit to court instead of
paying Sears the $630 for the carpet.
Slate Quad Council Representative
Paul Rosenthal maintained. “Our
contention throughout was that
Scars was at fault."

In the Council action Wednesday
night. some members thought that
although the solution to settle was
economical. the suit should be pur-
sued through thc court. However
they weighed thc“cconomics against
principle" and voted l5-2 to settle
the issue out of court.

Rosenlhal feels. “This is the most
economical solution" but addedlhat
the settlement offer “can be inter~

Dean of the Gruduulc School of

your. in order to return to research
and teaching. "I'm basically a
teacher and a researcher." says
Cownn. who will have been Dean of
the (lSI’A for almost six years by the
time he steps dotvn.

Cownn says lhnt the reasons
behind his decision to return to more
academic. as opposed lo iid-
minislrulive. pursuits. are “very sim-
ple rcnlly." After seeing his
icollcugucs "happily" engaged in
research and teaching over the mr:
(We and in half years. Cowun 5:1)»,"l
ﬁnally came to the conclusion that
perhaps this was more what I would
like to get back to doing.“ Cowan
feels that “purl of who! makes a un-
iversity interesting is contact with
students." In his position as Dean.
Cowsn feels that he has hud“vcrylit-
tie in the way of what l would call in»
tellcctuul contact with students . .
. I miss the contact with the
students."

Several of Cownn's colleagues are
sympathetic to his reasons for relin-
quishing his position as Dean. Ac-
cording lo former Political Science
Chuirmun Joseph Zimmerman. “I
can appreciate why after nearly six
years he would wunl to step down."
Citing the lack ofiime which an ad-
minislrnior has for teaching and-or
research. Zimmerman says. “I
resigned us[PoliiicaI Science] Chair-
man for those reasons."

Public Administration Professor
Virgil Zimmerman commented. “As
I seek. he[Cowan]is basicallya man
of scholarly lempermant." '

His Teaching

As to u speculation that Cowan's
resignation came as part of a move
similar to President Ford’s realign-
ment of his "team." Cowan says. “I
don't think there's any anologylhere
that I know of certainly. I‘m com-
plctcly in agreement with the greater
emphasis the President [of the Un-
iversity] is giving to service to the
stale and the community.

“A new administratormlghi have
some ideas on ihutlhnl I don't have."
Says Cowan. "I‘m also to some
degree convinced that a Dean
probably has most of the effective
ideas that he cnncurry cul inlhc first
