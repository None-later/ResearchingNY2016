Carter Camp

by Dltlel Guinea

Like robots. the secret service men
moved around the Campus Center
Assembly Hall as if at the direction
of ti man speaking softly into a
Wﬂlltie-talkie. Pla'stictubcs conveyed
wires to small speakers in their ears.
Presidential hopeful Jimmy Carter.
former Governor of Georgia, left the
hall with the dozen Secret Service
men scattered about him. Yeah, a
Democratic contender was It
SUNYA.

But so were Secret Service men.
And that made the event. It had
national importance because of the
Service, not because of Caner.

Carter said things politicians say
to college audiences.

~“I think the establishment of
Israel was. . .certuinly not racist."

——“thn I‘ve been around other
countries. . .I‘ve been embarrassed
and insulted to ﬁnd a fat. bloated.

tributer to Richard Nixon sitting in

the language. '

—“There should be a minimum of
dependence on rnilltery strenﬂh.”
All to on.

Jimmy Caner is a little different
from the other Democratic hopefuls.
He has been campaigning full-time
since leaving office last January. He
is not it lawyer—he is an engineer. a
