Professor Robert F. ‘ Creegan is a
philosophy professor at .SUN‘YA
and an expert on the phenomena of
Unidentiﬁed Flying 0bjects(U1-‘0).
Creegan. a prominent ﬁgure in
U F0 circles, explained. “my interest
in UFO‘s began'in i940‘whenl was
visiting a childhood friend. We Were
outside walking when we saw this
large triangular 'thing‘ in the sky. It

was glowing and traveled at an
amaring speed—I‘d say around l500
mph. I thought'to myself. ‘what the
hell could this be?”

“About ten years later.” he paus-
ed. stroking his slightly balding
head. “the UFO-thing became
prominent. Reports of UFO
sightings poured in from all parts of
the world. Tens of thousands are on
record for the last two decades:

Basic Skills Gap Is Found
In "Many College Students

by The College Press Service

When college students were the
academic elite of their high school
classes. college administrators and
init'rtictors assumed that entering
freshmen knew basic grammar and
composition cold. Now with more
high school students goingto college
and admissions standards at many
schools loosening. college ad-
ministrators are recognizing the ex-
istence of a basic skills gap which
handicaps many college students.

Colleges and universities across
the country are setting up remedial
programs to meet the needs of
students who ﬁnd they have never
learned how to write in complete
sentences. Basic skills programs are
most prevalent at two-yearand com-
munity colleges. but the problem has
also surfaced at private four-year
schools which have traditionally
drawn the cream of the high school
crop.

At the University of South Carol-
ing (USC) where lower SAT scores

prompted a remedial grammar class
called English 100. the admissions
director blamed the increasing pop-
ularity of college for decreasing
proﬁciency in English skills. “A
broader segment of people taking
the test results in it broader base of
ability being measured." he said.
referring to tlte dcclitting SA'I'
SCOTCS.

The director of the English IOO
progratn at USC called the program
“a survival course“ and accused high
schools of over-eiiiphasizing
literritiiretit the expense of grammar.
“It isn't always the stitdcnis' fault
that they lack these skills." she said
“Most students tell us that the last
time they had it grammar review was
the eighth grade."

Other university officials have
different explanations for the tinder-
ediicated college student. Jerome
\Vever. University College Dean at
Oklahoma University. attributed
part of the problem to the shifts in
high school goals from thethrce R's
to more social and personal growth.

Others claintcd it was a problem
unique to this generation which was
raised‘ oti television and radio. ln-
structors at ' the University of
California have reported that
students in their freshman English
classes are not proficient in even the
fundamentals oi grammar. 'l‘lie
remedial English or Subject A super-
visor argued that t liis"i|literacy“ was
a “cultural problctti. as students in
ltll electronic society have little
chance to acquire reading-writing
skills.“

According to the director of
academic programs at UCLA. the
teievisiort society is to bltime for less
educated college students.
“Students today are more verbal.“ he
said. “They don't retid. They don't
have the written skills they once did.
They‘re 'I’V educated."

liul ll recent report in the Chris-
tian Science Monitor holds the

"'whole

college oriented society
responsible for the lower level of
skills of incoming freshmen. The
report states that many ofﬁcials feel
the reason for the student skills gap
is the fact that the whole post-
secondary education system has
become ,much less elite.

This has been particularly true in
recent years when many colleges
have begun admitting students who
would not have met the minimum

about one thousand closcencounter
cases: and perhaps a dozen in-
tcrcsting crises of alleged contact
with alien beings.“

Creegnn. who has worked as a
consultant for the Aerial
Phenomena Research Organiration

.(AI’RO) since I970. insiststhiitthere
is deﬁnitely not enough information
to explain UFO‘s as extra-terrestrial
.visistations but that it is a serious
problem deservinga lot of attention.

“I don't deﬁnitely accept the
extra-terrestrial hypothesis but if
they are extra-terrestrial craft. what
they. would seem to be doingis some
type of surveillance or observation;
probably trying to learn something
about our planet."

There are those who m y that law
and order are just code words for
repression and bigotry. This is
dangerous nonsense. Law and order
are code words for goodness and
decency. . . the anlywayloauack
crime in America is rhe way crime at-
tacks our people—without pity. "-—
President Richard Nixon, in-
troducing the original draft of
Senate Bill I, March 14. 1973.

Imagine a law that could put the
New York Times editors who receiv-
ed the Pentagon Papers in jail for
seven years but acquit virtually all
the Watergate criminals because
they claimed: they had mistakenly
thought that their illegal acts were
ofﬁcially authorized. Imagine that
and you have captured one of the
many controversial features of the
Criminal Justice Reform Act Of
I975. commonly known as SB |.

SB I, now under consideration by

the Senate JudiciaryCommittee un-
der the leadership of John
McClellan (D-AR), was originally
intended to update and reform the
US Criminal Code. Instead, the

'massive bill would leave the

American public with a legacy of the
Nixon’ "law and order" administra-
tion.

Under the proposed code, the
death penalty would be restored for
treason, sabotage and murder under
a wide variety of circumstances. ,

The 1968 anti-riot law, which
makes it a crimeto cross state linesto
incite a riot. would be redrafted. A
"riot" could involve as few as ten
people who create a “grave danger of
imminently causing" damage to
property. But at the same time. a per-
son could be convicted for commit-
ting a crime that was provoked orin-
cited by a police agent. In this case.
the “incitement to riot" provision
does not apply to the police agent.

The burden would be on the defen-
dant to prove “unlawful entrap-
ment" by that agent.

Under SB 1. possession of the
slightest amount of marijuana
carries a sentence of 30 days and/or
a $10.000iine. For a second offense.

the jail term jumps to six months.

Under the new act. wiretapping
authority would be greatly ex-
panded. The government could im-
pose 48hour “emergency.' wiretaps
without court approval and direct
telephone companies and landlords
to cooperate “forthwith and unob-
trusively" with the wiretappers.

Under “Official Secrets Act“ sec-
tions. the deﬁnition of espionage is
expanded. Disclosing “national
defense information" to unauthoriz-
ed persons is a crime. “National
defense information" goes beyond
that information which is classified.
covering almost every aspect of
military and intelligence activities.

Both faculty and students using
the linear accelerator are concerned
witlt the problem of radiation. Ac-
cording to llaberl. ait engineer
whose llllllll concern is the proper
functioning ol the accelerator. "there
is Virtually no possibility of leakage

to the outside World. due tothe isola-
tion prmtdcd by ten feet of dirt
between the machine and the
podium." l-labcrl believes that “the
danger lies potentially with someone
who Works here. not a student.“
There is atriple warning system. It
includes safety gates that
automatically stop the machine if
tripped. radiation monitors dispers-
ed throughout the lab. and a huge
red alarm Willi the word “Scrum”
stamped on it. that will go off if the

other two should fall.

A four foot thick concrete wall
surrounds the target room. where
closed circuit television cameras are
located to allow for observation.
without fear of radiation exposure.
“the difference between a reactor
and tin accelerator." explains
liakhrtt. "is that the latter does not
have a constant llow of radiation
generating front it. Therefore. once
the accelerator is shut oil. the threat
of exposure is eliminated."

5le is the paradoxical result of
early efforts to reform and update
the many archaic measures found in
the huge US criminal code. Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson appoint a
commission in 1966 to study a d
overhaul the criminal code. 'I'Iit
body. the National Commission of
Reform of Criminal Law. was
chaired by former California Gover-
nor Pat Brown. and submitted its
ﬁnal report to President Nixon in
I971

But President Nixon had thebill
rewritten by Attorney General John‘
Mitchell and his successor Richard
Kleindienst. Later. Senators John
McClellan and Roman Hruska (R-
NB). leaders on the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee of Criminal' Laws
and Procedures. consolidated the
Brown Commission version and the
Nixon version into the current SB 1.
The new bill resembles the Nixon ad-
ministration‘s version much more
than it doesthat ofthe Brown Com-
mission.

In nine years. the original intent of
the Brown Commission has been
diluted and altered. Louis Schwartz.

director of the Brown COIMOII.
accused the Nixon interpretation of
contradtaing “in every reaped“ the
oriﬁnal recommendations for Nor-
nilng the criminal code. He labeled

the Nixon proposal a “prop-in d r

primitive vengefulness". ‘

The Senate Judiciary Committee
will probably vote on SB I before
Christmas. Although President
Ford has endorsed the criminal code
bill as it stands. some of the senators
who co-sponsored the bill are having
second thoughts. Birch Biyh (D-IN)
has withdrawn his sponsorship.
Even Hruska. a staunch conser-
vative and one of the bill's chief'sup-
porters. has recently indicated a
willingness to amend some of the
“ofﬁcial secrets" sections.

But critics of the bill are still wary.

“The willingness of the bill‘s
proponents to compromise." said an
association director of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “is
likely to result in amendmentsthat
will make the bill. while still not
acceptable to us. just palatable
enough to receive majority sup-
port . . . on the Senate floor.“

Students Lack Basic Skills

continued/rm" page six
qualifications for admission several
years ago when the competition for
college space was ﬁerccr. For in-
stance. students with SAT verbal
scores of 350 can he admitted to the
University of South Carolina. but
enrollment in a basic skills program
is required for freshmen with verbal
scores between 350 and 390.
Althouin hundreds of colleges
and universities are making basic
skills programs available to their
students. it is ofteji the student‘s
choice to attend or not to attend. Un-
fortunately. many students do not

recognize their own needs for
remedial classes and spam them.
There is still a stigma attached to
classes which set out to do no more
than teaclt college students skills
they should have acquired in secon-
dary schools. And many colleges
which offer basic skills classes give
little or no college credit for the
hours spent catching up.

But if the basic skills levels of in-
coming frcshmen continues to
decline. students may rush to the
remedial English courses just to in-
sure their survival in regular college
classrooms.
