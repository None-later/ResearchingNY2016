A medical inquiry was launched
after a 70-year-old pensioner died of
a heart attack after viewing a
Swedish sex picture. According to
Frankfurt doctors: “When viewing
pornographic scenes. the heart beats
faster . . . the glands work harder,
more hormones are produced. the
blood pressure climbs—and for
some people this is just too
much of a strain on the heart.“ V

u.s. Buys Dope

The United States government has
received a birarre offer to purchase
more than one-quarter of this year's
illicit worldwide opium crop.

The offer comes from insurgent
military leaders .in northern Burma
who claim to control the $36 million
a year Burmese opium black market.

New York Congressman Lester
Wolff. who received the offer while
in the Far East studying ways to
reduce the flow of heroin tothe U.S..
calls the proposal “a unique oppor-
tunity.“

activists with bogus birth oertiﬁute'o
enabling the activists to obtain false
identifications. ‘

Fill Special Agent Will Heatonof
Los Angeles admitted under’oa'thin
a Los Angeles federal tax evasion
case last month that the .bureau‘
supplied him with the birth oer: I
tilicates of two infantswho haddied '
shortly after birth.

Accordingtothc FBI. the activists
use the birth certificates to establish
new identities. The FBI. inthe mean-
time. keeps arecordof the false birth
certificates it hands out. and thus has
an easy method of keeping track of
the person using the new identity.

The FBl‘s admission in Los
Angeles comes just a few months
after Bureau Director Clarence
Kelley attacked the practice by
political fugitives of “using the birth
certiﬁcates of dead babies" to es-
tablish new i.d.‘s.

Bombs Away

A leading scientificjournul is war-
ning about the possibility that a
single hydrogen bomb explosion
could set off a nuclearchain reaction
through the molecules oflhc seas. in-
stantly vaporizing the entire Eunh.

This is the warning voice in the
current edition of the Bulletin ql'lhc
Atomic Scienliils.

The author. Doctor H.C. Dudley.
a professor of radiation physics at
The University of lllinois. says that
no reputable scientist has yet run a
computer calculation on the chances
of a high order fusion explosion
causing "a runaway nuclear chain
reaction."

Doctor Dudley states that when
the atomic bomb was first designed
in I945. atomic scientists Calculated
at the time that the chances were
slightly less titan three in oncmillion
than an uncontrolled chain reaction
might be triggered.

He warns that even with the far
more powerful fusion-type bombs
being exploded today. no one has
bothered to calculate the new odds
of a single explosion being able to
destroy the Earth.
