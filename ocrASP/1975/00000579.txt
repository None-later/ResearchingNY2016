by Jonathan Penn

Writers of reviews are invariably faced with
the problem of “What if the concert .is It’ll/If
good"? Nothing is Vsimpler' than writing a
review of a bad concert. but how does one
compliment a group without sounding redun-
dant? This was my_ personal problem in
reviewing the Cleveland String Qunrtet's con-
cert of November In. Though marred by cer-
tain inconsistancies. the bulk of the Quartet's
playing was truly brilliant.

A factor in the group‘s favor wasthe quality
of Page Hall. Located on the downtown cam-
pus. this rather small concert hall provides t he
intimacy and wonderful acoustics that
Chamber Music requires. It seems to be one of
those rare auditoriums where “every seat is a
good one!“ Eycn though my seat was on the
balcony. rather far back. I wasahlc to hearthe
concert perfectly.

The program was started off by the last of
Beethoven‘s “Early” quartet. Op. I8. No. 6.
Still written in the style of Mozart and Haydn.
the piece only begins to take on the stamp of
Beethoven’s individuality in the second and
ﬁnal movements. especiallythe ﬁnale. Deeply
moving and playing as il'tbey wereasingle en-
tity and not a collection of individuals. the
group brought out the “flavor” of sorrow
which pervades this Ii nal movement. The piece
seemed to bring out the concert. Brilliant
passage work. especially in the slow

’movements. with occasional jarring incon-

sistencics in various parts was the order of the
day.

Having chosen a program with a represen—
tative from each of Beethoven‘s three periods.
the string quartet Op.59. No.3(MiddIe Phase)

was next. Nicknamed the “Eroica Quartet." it
is one of Beethoven‘s works that “. . . probes
the very depths of his soul. . . . finding there
only darkness and lonely despair. . .“ Already

Beethoven has begun that deep soul searching ‘

which so characterized his later works.
Beautiful throughout their performance. the
group excelled on the second movement.
' marked Allegro Vivace. The whole movement
is constructed in a huge example of Sonata
Allegro form. so complex that it seems to
overﬂow the bounds of the string quartet.

Called upon to perform the impossible task
of generating an orchestral volume and quali-
ty ol'sountl. the Quartet rose to the occasion.
delivering a performance startling in its
emotional intensity. This emotional depth
showed throughout the piece. along with a
great amount of musical scholarship. Their
playing of the Menuctto is the case in point.
The Menuetto is a deliberate foil to the depth
of the slow movement preceding it. The
Quartet especially pleased me in not tryingto
make more ofthis movement thanthere really
Is.

Finally. the players performed the "Late"
quartet. Op. 130 with its original ending. the
Grosse Fuge. intact. Il' onetakesthe broadest
aspect of “humour.” that is. humour as an ex-
pression of mental triumph over the sorrows
of this world. this is Beethoven at his most
humourous. Unfortunately. the Quartet
began to lose their high level ofconccntration
which made the ﬁrst half ol'thcir program so
inspired. Still playing through the slow move-
ment with great deliberation and charm. they
“lost it" in the Grosse Fuge. The “ Fuge“ is ac-

 

   
  

tually two large f ugues. each with numerous
variations and combined. at times. with the
other fugue. There was a distinct lack ol'focus
about this whole section. Little prominence
was given to separate fugue lines. even when
one instrument‘s line was more important
than the others. then so. the piece was veryen-
joyable. and the individual and collective
enthusiasm of the group remained high.
There were surprising breaks in the
Quartct‘s playing. worse because of the well-
known excellence of the players. Even so. a
major part of the concert was beautiful. A

Tannin

large and varied audience including many
students and professors responded to the
whole concert favorably. In fact. the group
was brought out for an encore. the alternate
ending to 0p.130. A very gay and bollterote
ﬁnale was performed. with both rapidity and
drive. It was performed to the high standard
which exemplified the conccn‘s ﬁrst half. The
piece ended the program in fine style.

All factors taken into consideration. the
concert was decidedly excellent. but not up to
the high that I was expecting from the
Cleveland String Quartet.
