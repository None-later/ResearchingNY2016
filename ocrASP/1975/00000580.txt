by Bruce Connolly

For years the arduous mission of spreading the word
of The Kinks was left to a motley cult (or ‘kult‘ as they
persisted in spelling it) of fanatics who. unfortunately.
were ill-suited to the task. Driven looney from years of
hiding in dark attics and under dusty beds. their minds

‘ distorted by the influence of hazy Autumn days and
dirty sunsets. their speech garbled by an almost demonic
obsession with certain potent fluids. wild-eyed Kinks'
fans were regarded with contempt and distrust by
normal people who informed them pointedly, and often

' very rudely. that The Kinks did not exist.

Dismayed, but still possessing the kind of defiance
that turns Eagle Scouts into snipers when denied the
proper outlet. their fans would maneuver a scarred copy
of Arthur or Ei'ervbodv's in Showbiz onto the
phonograph before crawling back underthe bed to wait.

Sometimes the normals merely stalked ot‘l’in disgust.
Sometimes theyjust laughed. But sometimes, in spite of
their betterjudgement. they listened. and laughed, and
then listened a lot harder. Another victim.

Despite the non-existence often attributed to them,
The Kinks have created and performed the most
divergent, individualized rock &roil ofthe last decade.

. Lyrieztlly. musically, and thematically, their
com positions have pushed the boundaries of rock music
in directions that few other builds have attempted. And
once again. The Kinks are coming. This time to
Albany‘s Palace Theater on Dec. 2. Theirentertainment
extravanganza will feature their forthcoming album.

Judy Garland on roller skates. A match for Shirley
Temple even on an off night. Singer, songwriter. Mr.
Showbiz. Mr. Wonderful. Mr. Ray 'Davies is the total
performer. Hiding in the spotlight. he parodies himself
so successfully and so hilariously that you nearly forget
the fragility and incredible beauty of the man. Again
and again you can't help feeling that Ray‘s chief
embarrassment in life is the fact that he's so talented.
He‘s raunchy and he‘s vulnerable and he only takes
himself seriously if you promise not to look.

0n lead guitar and back-up vocals is Dave Davies. an
acquaintance of Ray‘s. who‘s playing gets more
aggressive with each tour. John Dalton. the King of
Rock & Roll who lays down a lethal bass line between
poses. and Mick Avory. one ofthe few really intelligent
drummers around who playstothesong rather thanjust
pounding away behind it. form the rhythm section.

Last. but not least. is the exquisite Mr. John Gosling
on pianoforte. John. themusical center of the band and
Ray‘s best friend on stage. is so intenselyshythat unless
someone staggers against the piano and toppiesthe wail
of beer cans that he meticulouslyerects between himseli
and the audience during the course ofthe performance.
you may never catch a glimpse of him. Together the)

The Kinks. With all due respect. you‘ll never knon
what rock & roll is all about until you've seen them.
