 was defeated, by the Albany School

of Medicine. I4-6, in the ﬁnals of the
District Seven-A-Side
Rugby Tournament Saturday.

The ruggers' had defeated the
Albany School of Law in the open-
ing game of the tournament. 14-4.
Scoring for the winners were Bob
Goldberg (twice) and Chuck Rap-
paZZO. Goldberg also kicked a two
point conversion in the victory. ‘

The second game of the tourney
pitted Albany State against Troy.
Chuck Rappazzo scored twice and
Bob Goldberg booted another con-
version to lead Albany to a IO-O vic-
tory.

The Lincoln Park ﬁeld was in bad
shape because of the previous day‘s
snow. and the ﬁeld conditions had a
big influence on the games, accor-
ding to Albany coach Chuck Rap-
pazzo.

“If you could get outside fast, you
had a good chance of scoring,“ said
Ruppazzo. “With the ﬁeld the way it
was. long outside runs were the big
ground gainers.“

The tournament games consisted
of two seven minute halves. The
serum was composed of only three
men. with four men playing in the
backﬁeld. As a result, there is very
little panting in seven-a-side play.

“The idea is to keep possession of
the ball, because if you are forced to

punt, a long runbaclt will result.“
said Rappazzo.

The championship game was
closer than the score indicated.
Albany opened the scoring with
Wences Rodriguez scoring the ﬁrst
tryof the day. Bob Goldberg. whole
kicking was excellent during the
tournament, added the conversion
points. Albany Med also scored in
the ﬁrst half. but Albany managed a
6-4 halftime lead.

In the second half, Albany Med
forged a l0-6 lead. In the closing
minutes. State was trying desperate-
1yforascore,andmanagedtoforcea
punt with a minute left in the game,
but no one was deep to ﬁeld it. The
result was an easy score {or Albany
Med, and the ﬁnal score was l4-6.

“We were tired going into the
final." said Rappazzo. “The Albany
Med backs were very quick, scoring
twice on long outside runs, so they
deserved the win.“

The Albany "B" team also played
in the tourney. compiling a 1-2
record. Their two losses were by
narrow margins. and they played
surprisingly well in the tournament,
according to Rappazzo.
