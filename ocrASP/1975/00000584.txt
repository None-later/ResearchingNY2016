“We like to let them (the football
team) know we’re thinking about
them,” said co-captain DeSonee.
The crepe-paper barrier the
cheerleaders constructed (for the
Danes to run through), and the
numerous hand-made signs made on
the Danes‘ behalf arejust some in-
dicators of that thoughtfulness.

Team On Move

by Clllstlne Icillrd‘» .

With a record of four (4) wins and
one (1) loss. the "Albany State
women‘s volleyball club is making a
bit of noise on the courts.

Plagued by aninjured achillesten-
don, the women's volleyball coach.
Judy Clark, has been temporarily
sidelined and has delegated thcjob
to Ted Earl, volleyball club ad-
ministrator. a very > enthusiastic
“rookie coach” (in his' own words).

A new intercollegiate team must

function under club stat’usion an in- 4

tercollegiate level ifUNBtee ‘ ears
before it can petition the Ath éiic

Advisory Board for varsity standing. "

“We've nmdhb’hﬂli‘gula‘édthb'
being that waits .aiﬁrstiyear, club."
said Earl. “Wetnedatoischedule our
matches with other teams capable of
the same  of play."

The IS-membi:r club, cut down
from the original 40 women who
signed up consists of one graduate
student, one senior. one junior, four
sophomores, and eight freshmen.

“We have a young club (in both
existence and membership", said
Earl. “We call it a dynasty. They‘re
what we‘re going to build on."

Union College was the club‘s first
victim by scores of I5-3, 6—15, and
|5-2. When Union came to Albany
for the return match, the
Dutchwomen gained revenge I5-6.
3-15. and |0-l5. Albany took their
next three matches against Russell
Sage (3-15, l5-4. 15-3), Ulster(15~8,
I 5-7) and Columbia-Greenc( I 5-3. 8-
I5, I5-9). "-

“We‘ve beaten a statetournament-

bound team (Russell Sage)," said
Earl. “I feel this is an indication of
the team quality we‘re trying to
build.
The Danettes will face RPI and New
