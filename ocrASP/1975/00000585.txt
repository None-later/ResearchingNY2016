The death of the Campus Center
barbershop, a longtime thorn in the
side of student governments at
SUNYA, marks the successful end of
SA's struggleto gain control of FSA.
But it is only the beginning of SA's
plans to exercise its newly acquired
power in an attempt to make FSA
more responsive to students.

The quest for student control of
FSA reached its ﬁnal plateau
Wednesday when a student-
dominated Board of Directors
elected SA Controller Stu Klein
FSA President, replacing ad-
ministrator John Hartley. Klein is
the first strident president in the cor-
poration‘s history.

"l havcahigh regard for Stu,"said
FSA General Manager E. Norbert
Zahm. Zahm worked with Klein
over the summer on a controller to

controller basis and believes heis,

capable of handling the position.

“The whole idea of a Board of
Directors," said Klein. “is to give the
company direction. Hopefully this
direction will be towards more stu-
dent responsiveness."

Whether or not the students will
remain in power on FSA is
questionable. Their status could be
threatened by a set of guidelines
drawn up by Chancellor Boyer‘s of-
ﬁcc. Speciﬁcally, the guidelines state
that “no single constituency shall
have more than 50 percent of the
Board, [of Directors] membership
nor shall the student constituency
have less than one-third the
membership on the fBoard."

The SUNY Board of Trustees has
not yet acted on these guidelines.
They are on the agenda for the

 

Part one of a Iwo-part series.

Board's December meeting.

"We don‘t feel they'll come up un-
til next year," said SA Vice President
Rick Meckler. Meckler is conﬁdent
SA will have at least all of next
semester to work with the new struc-
ture. He pointed out that the
guidelines were on the Board‘s agen—
do for both the October and
November meetings, yet no action
was taken on them.

in one of their ﬁrst acts. the
student-controlled Board eliminated
the Campus Center barbershop. "By
January 20," said Klein, “the
barbershop should be out of there."

The vacated barbershopspace will
be occupied by a food co-op. “We
feel that students would rather have
a food co-op than a barbershop,“
said Klein. “it was felt. basically.
that the barbershop was not an es-
sential service to students. They can
get it elsewhere . . . Afood c0<opis
a service that will provide food
cheaper than it can be bought in a
grocery store— plus it's convertie nt."

 

A priorities committee was form-
ed to plan FSA‘s future. Student
ideas for projects include refur-
bishing the Rathskeller and es-
tubiishing an on-campus
delicatessen.

Klein feels that conditions in the
Quad cafeterias need looking into.

' Board member Jay Miller compiled

a list of complaints that have been
registered about the operation ofthe
cafeterias. The list includes gripes
such as cold fried chicken, raw
steaks. throwing lemons. a cook
sticking ﬁngers in food. and worms
in corn.

The Board instructed Zahm to
check into these problems.
“Someone has to be at fault
somewhere," said Meckler.

Klein said the Board of Directors
will hold periodic meetings in the
Quad cafeterias to “keepthem up to
date on what that stuff is like down
there.“

Student Records Source Of Info For Police

by Vinny Reds _

State Police ofﬁcials yesterday
acknowledged that information
received during the early l970's from
university security and administra-
tion ofﬁcials at SUNYA was used to
increase the agency's extensive in-
telligence ﬁles on student protest ac-
tivities.

Dean of Student Affairs Neil
Brown denied however. that he had
any knowledge of regular contacts
between state police investigators

. and campus. officials. Such private

meetings Wcrc being held at the State
University at Stony Brook at that
time. as reported in Nz-wxdayin mid-
November.

The Stony Brook casc involved
contact between three campus public

relations ofﬁcials and State Police

investigator John Tengsti'om. who
was supplied with "names of student
radical leaders and groups, as well as
reports on what happened at
demonstrations." according to

Newsday.

The material is now being remov-
cd from State Police ﬁles because, as
acknowledged by its superintendent
William Connelie, the material “had
no relation to law enforcement." A
report last month had ﬁrst revealed
that a large system of noncriminal
ﬁles existed within the agency.

A Connelie assistant, Douglas
Dales, yesterday admitted that dissi-

dent groups and campus radicals-

from SUNYA were also placed in

Students Protest Possible Bus Cuts

by Paula Rasnlek

An estimated crowd of 300'

students, some carrying signs and
shouting slogans, rallied yesterday
outside the ofﬁce of Vice President
for Management and Planning John
Hartley. The demonstration was in
protest of possible cutbacks that
may occur in SUNYA's bus service

due to the SUNY-wide hiringfreeze.
[Hiring Prohibited

The state‘s action: passed on
November 13, prohibits the replace-
ment of any vacancy created in any
department in the SUNY system.
The only way around this is to apply
to the state Division of Budget foran
exemption. Since the freeze was im-

posed three vacancies have opened
up among the bus drivers. Exemp-
tion and consequent replacement of
these drivers was applied for
yesterday, according to Hartley.
After the freeze took effect.
Physical Plant Director Frank Kopf
contacted SA to discuss possible cut-
backs. Central Council Represen-

 

SA President Andy Iauman relllee student demonstrators on the Mum yesterday.

tative Jay Miller was under the im-
pression that Kopf implied that the
cutbacks were to be planned,
scheduled. and implemented as soon
as possible. This led to the impres-
sion that the cutbacks were definite.
Kopfexplainedthat heis working on
the new schedule now because
students can adjust more quickly to a
set schedule, than to u system of ran-
domly cutting bus runs. Miller add-
ed that SA was discussing
possibilities but was ﬁnding the
situation extremely difﬁcult. Some
representatives were to meet with
Hartley yesterday.

The rally itself was organized and
led by Alumni Quud Board. Quad
Board President Bryant Monroe
said that he was told about thefrccze
shortly before Thanksgiving
weekend. Residents of the quad
voiced the opinion that any cutbacks
in bus service would be intolerable.
and after listening to SA President
Andy Bauman discussthe issue early
this week. decided to hold the
demonstration. It was hoped that in
this way more answers could be
gotten. along with a guarantee from
Hartley that there would be no cut-
backs. Monroe and others do not

these ﬁles.

“We would rather they were term-
ed ' ‘departmentai reports‘,“ said
Dales. “They consisted usually of in-
formation on a card about someone
we suspected. When nothing panned
out about him, his card was placed in
that ﬁle.

“We saw nothing criminal inthis.”
Dale added. “If there was a com—
plaint at the university, we simply
followed up on it. l think that the
State Police have a right to know
what goes on in this area. Now we
find out that the ﬁles are wrong, and
so they go."

John l-lcnnigan. assistant director
of SUNYA campus security,
acknowledged that his own
organization ‘had worked with the
state police in special circumstances
during the protest era. “If we knew
that every time a group got together
windows were smashed, we‘d p've
them the necessary information,“ he
said.

Leaders Known

Hennigan admits that security's
ability in gathering information is
extensive. “There isn't anything on
this campus i can't ﬁnd out about,”
he says. “At that particular time we
were aware of who the political
leaders were and where the groups
were gathering.
