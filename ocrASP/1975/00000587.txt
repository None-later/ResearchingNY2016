Beneﬁt Carnival Set

by David lgvy

A carnival for the beneﬁt of
autistic children is being held Satur-
day. December 6 at the First
Lutheran Church in Albany from ll
a.m. to 4 pm.

In addition to helping autistic
children. the carnival may soften
some of the criticism leveled at this
university as a student body doing
little for the community in which it
lives. The event is being sponsored
and entirelycoordinated by SUNYA
students.

What began as an idea for a class
project has developed into 'an
educational and stimulating task for
marketing students Andrew
Krostiefl. Craig Bell and Mindy
ﬁne. It has also been hard work.

“We had no idea ofthc difﬁculties
involved with setting this thing up."
said Junior Craig Bell. “Between
promotional consideration and
advertising. we've had to cover half
the city on foot."

In their efforts to put everything
together. the three have to ﬁnd a
place to hold the carnival, get
volunteers to help out. ﬁnd prizes
and goods to offer, as well as
promote it.

“I never realized just how much
bureaucratic red tapethere is outside
this school.” said llell. “Stores would
call their home ofﬁeein Oshkoshjust
to get the OK to give us a 59-cent
item."

The Church. located at llll
Western Avenue. was chosen
because ofthc size ofthc hall and the
availability of kitchen facilities.
Advertising was done on a major
scale as many popular radio and
television stations as well as

“Getting people to go is the hard
part." said project coordinator An-
drew Krostich. “All the footwork,
phone mils and headaches will be for
nothing if nobody comes.”

Autism is a rare condition found
in about three to four of l0.000
children. It is a severe disturbance of
mental and emotional development
in young children. Despite con-
siderable research in such ﬁelds as
psychology. genetics. and
neurology. very little is definitely
known about autism. To help
further the cause of the children. as
well as gaining community support

Student ‘Loan Fee’ is Increased

The New York Higher Education
Services Corporation announced
Saturday that the insurance
premium on student loans approved
after December I by the Corpora-
tion will increase to one percent. The
premium, referred to by thcstudents
as the “loan fee“ has stood at one-
half percent since September. 1972.

Eileen Dickinson. president of the
Corporation. explained that the fee
is the majorsource of funds available
to the Corporation to paythe State‘s
share of the loan guarantee. The in—
crease in the fee will generate about
$2 million additlohal funds in ﬁscal
l976—77.

The fee increase has been under
consideration since late summer
when the Department of Health.
Education and Welfare authorized
the increase. The State guarantees 20
percent of the loan. the Federal
Government 80 percent.

All proceeds fromthe fee as well as
limited State appropriations.
Dickinson explained, are used in the

Salaries and other expenses of the
Corporation are funded by separate
State appropriation.

Defaults are projected to increase
by about seven million dollars over
theCorporation‘sestimatcsfor ﬁscal
l975—76. That increase may be in
part attributed to increased use of
loans to ﬁnance education and to
difﬁculties experienced by recent
graduatﬁ seeking employment.

“Some 93 percent of the student
loans arein good standing.” Dickin-
son said. “and many ofthc students

DECEMBER 5. 1975

by Larry Shumel
Using the jargon of the SUNYA
librarians. this time of the year is
referred to as “the peak season". It is
the time of the year when most
students and faculty are under in-
creasing pressurc to

also the time when most damage is
done tothesc facilities. cxclusivelyto

Whether most people realize it or
not. the periodical room is byfarthc
most serviced room. compared to
the above 3 floors. It requires an ever
increasing amount of manpowor to
keep it in shape. Since August. the
number of ftlll time staff has in-
creased from two to seven. Addcdto
this. each week l88 hours of student

maintenance.

Taking the above ﬁgures into con—
sideration. one wouldtend to believe
that our periodical room is the most
well kept. organized. efﬁcient and
easiest room designed to fulﬁll your
every need. Sorry if you've been dis-
appointed.

The frustrating problems of
locating articles. editions. issues and
information is increasing because of
the selﬁshness of some of those who
make use ofthis room. Vandalism is
rampant. More journals are being
stolen and more articles and pictures
being razor-bladed out than ever
before.

This reporter asked librarian
Jeanne Farrington about some of
the insane techniques being prac-
ticed. “Some students hide volumes

ting the fact that we have installed a

ly what literature is being hit hardest.
clerk Judy Perkins replied.“The H‘s.
That's the business section. For ex-
timple. The Wall Street Scriptures
come in and is mutilated in the
course of an afternoon.” Harrington
went on to addthat A. P. periodicals.
such as Time and Life magazine
receive the same treatment.

There are those cases where
microforms; microﬁlms. cards and
the like are being stolen and
destroyed. “We are now forced to
keep magazines like Playboy.
Penthouse and MS under lock and
key and in a special section."
Harrington concluded.

In an effort to put a halt tothese
goings-on. the library has been con-
sidering mechanical answers; such as
mirrors for the walls. and electronic
devices for the doors that go un-
guarded. ln the meantime. much
energy. money and time is being put
into the reordering of lost hack

hen asked her opinion for I
solution to these problems. librarian
Anne Dowling stressed more studem
concern. “Students could help more
by using the information desk. We
have no way of knowing what
literature is missing if it is not
reported. Any questions. problems
and complaints should be voiced It
the information desk." She cited
several instances where students or
professors unable to locate their
references kcpt silent out of frustra-
tion. “This is not the answer."
What is the answer? To Wl'llll can
these scandalous acts be attributed?
Professor Bernard Johnpoll of the
political science department feels

that competition among students is I

the cause. In his opinion. “It‘s mad.
It‘s infuriating. It has reached the
point where I‘m afraid to assign a
paper because if I want to look up
the reference material two years
from nowit won't bctherc. Someone
who has irreprehensible morals
ought not to be involved in a com-
munity of scholars. If caught doing
this. he or she should be thrown

Plus/Minus Grading May Come to SUNYA

by Perry Silver

When you receive your grades at
the end ofthis semester. you should
be surprised if you see 8+ on the
paper. However. in the future it may
not be so surprising.

The possibility of having
plus/minus grading at Albany State
at some future state is now being
looked into by Larry Schwartz.

chairman of the academics com-
mittee of Central Council. He is
presently conducting a poll of all
segments of the college community
to ascertain the overall feeling con-
cerning the institution of this more-
exact form of grading.

Student response on Schwartz's
questionaire has been favorable
toward some type of plus/minus

pointed out that with grade inﬂa-

where many students now lie. In ad-
dition. a survey is being sent iothe
admissions ofﬁcers of graduate.

what effect plus minus grading will
have regarding them.

Next term. a referendum may be
included in university-wide elections
to gauge student opinion on
plus minus grading. Because ofthc
greatrnumbcrof opinions which will

voice of the students when the Un-

Consideration of plus/minus
grading will be seriously taken up
next semester when a University
Senritc subcommittee will be formed
for this purpose. The University
Senate is the important policy-
recommending body on campus.
and its ﬁnding will have a geat effect
on whether or not plus/minus
grading does become operative.
