' Holiday Sing Sm. 

by Ellnbefh Nllrmltll

“Holiday Sing" is being advertised
all around campus. But what is the
entertainment being presented in the
gym on December 7 all aboul'l

Mark Roscn co-chnirpcrson of
Albany Campus Events is organiz-
ing Holiduy Sing 1975, after having
been associated with it for several
years. He said "This is 1! student get-
togclhcr and we hope he enormous
amount ofudvcrtising will rcsultina
better turnout."

A different theme is chosen each
year and this year Rosen explained
(we leave up uplothcirimagination)
“as long as it pertains to holiday
spirit past present and future and
linked to the spirit of‘76."

Twcmy-lwo groups will compete
for u trophy and a second prize in
each of two categories. and one prize
will he give for the most spiriled per-
f ormancc. The group with the best
musical arrangements will be award-
ed one trophy, while the most
original group will win the other.
The judges include faculty, students
and administration and “warm

world.

friendly competition” is the. aim.

Thoughts of Scrooge and Marley .

and bowls of steaming punch ulter-
nnled with a mental picture of Old
Glory waving proudly in the breeze
outside the podium. while listening
to Rosen talking about the spirit of
Christmas; of ‘76, and of holidays in
general. “The purpose is to induce
spirit, enthusiasm. and exuberance"
he said, “so that everybody is having

‘a good time."

These sentiments were echoed by
those of the participants of‘Holiday
Song. AlDelanceyHall. Ellen Gold-
man told me the idea is “to have
fun...lhc spirit of singing is more im-
portant than quality.“ She went on
to say that their group had dressed
up in choir robes and carried off the
trophy for musicality last your.

Robert Golian. the director ofthc
Theta X Omega group said they were
introducing a new carol arranged by
Alice Parker and Ruben Shaw.
Another group. made up of 40
freshman were preparing for their
ﬁrst performance with the required
enthusiasm. The singers advised,

 

lmaglne an order of 22.000 prlesls and brothers In 73
countries around the World. (That's a pretty blg family.)

But that's what the Saleslans of St. John Bosco are all
about — a large famlly ol community-minded men dedlcaled
lo the sarvlce of youlh. (And no one gets lost.)

In the 1800's a chance maellng belween a poor
priest and a street urchln served to create a movement of such
success that It Is atlll growlng today. Don Bosco became the
prlesl who brought youth back from the streets - and

back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play. learn and pray would
make uselul clllzens of the world. He crowded out 3le with
reason, rellglon and klndness In a (what was then unheard of)

atmosphere of family splrll.

The Ideals of St. John Boscc are still wllh us today. Hls
work goes on ln boys clubs. technical and academlc schools.
guidance centers. summer camps and mlsalons. And hla very
human approach In very evldanl ln the family aplrll ol the
Salaslans. This lathe way he wanted It. Thls Is the way It Is.
The Saleslan exparlence lsn'l learned — ll's I/vad.

they have a chance to perform their
best possible effort.”

The performers have the use ofthe
sound syslems. backdrop lighting
and ampliﬁers. They will provide
their own props. but this year the
organizers have provided 4 Christ-
mas trees. There was also a whisper
about a giant cake with Best Wishes
from Ace on it.

Some people are fond of saying
that SUNYA students are only
numbers. However Rosen remarked
that “school still has a personal side
to it.“ Holiday Sing may bea good il-
lustralion.

more professional now” he said “and
they have an expanded repertoire".
Dr. Peterson also spoke about, a
faculty group called the Elder
Statesman under the direction of
Steven Osmond.

Some time ago several students
asked about Holiday Sing said
“What is it?". but the current adverti-
sing campaign should inform many
aboul the event. _

The program has been streamlin-
cd this year by omitting run-offs.
"Since there are no semi-finals"
Rosen said, “each group will make
one presentation only. In this way

“use props for visual effect and few
lines. Also cohesiveness with the
lines used, in order to pull the
characters together and to poke fun
at each other.“

Holiday Sing is nothing if not
traditional, if 24 annual perfor-
mances is enough to qualify for this
description. Dr. Karl Peterson of the
Faculty of Music has directed
former shows. He said that the
earlier performances were longer
and included more religious music.
They were held in Page Hall and
were well attended by very
enthusiastic audiences. "They are
