ty. Virginia, are selling what they
claim is “a piece of the actual carpet

Democratic National Headquarters
at the time of the Democratic
National Headquarters at thetime of
the historic break-in."

For only $7. 50. you can now buy a
one-and-a-half inch square piece of

the five Watergate burglars
arrested while standing on portions
of this same carpet.”

PENTAGON PLANS

New "mes magazine reports it
has obtained thousands of pages of
military documents which outline a
secret Pentagon strategy for
crushing civil disturbances within
the United States. '

According to New Times. the
domestic military scenario is spelled
out in six loose-leaf Defense Depart-
ment binders obtained through legal
actions. The operation has been
given the overall code name of
“Garden Plot.”

The documents state that in the
late I960‘s and the early l970's.
military. National Guard. police and
SWAT leaders held a series of at
least three secret contingency plan-

ning sessions, code-named Cable .

Spliccr One. Two and Three.

The papers indicate that the
Defense Department established a
“domestic war room“ in the Pen;
tagon basement that wassurrounded
by acetate map overlays of American
cities and operated by a full-time
staff of ISO persons.

One Cable Splicer drill. according
to New Times. began with a
hypothetical shootout between an
ethnic minority group and police. By
the time that hypothetical uprising
was controlled four days later. the
magazine says, it had escalated into a
small scale civil war, and had
resulted in the systematic detention
of radical and activist leaders who
were being kept track of by a
Defense Department computer.

According to the Garden Plot
documents. the Pentagon is

INDIAN GIVERS

The tribal leaders of California‘s
‘lndianreservations are taking up a
collection to refund the $24 which
was originally paid to lndiantribes
for Manhattan Island.

In a letter to New York ofﬁcials
who are plagued by bankruptcy
problems, the tribal chiefs state:
“Guilt feelings have plagued us all.
We knew it was a bad investment
when we sold it."

The chiefs, who admit that their
gesture is partially satirical. say they
will send their $24 donation to New
York City‘s Controller.

HYPNOTIC WARFARE
An Arizona private researcher has
obtained and released a previously-
classiﬁed Air Force studyindicating
that the Pentagon has conducted ex-
tensive studies onthe use of hypnosis

in w... . ‘-

tainedthe 25-pa’ IIIIdYrGOIIdm» ‘ V
in' I958. entitled “The Use «It» ~
nosis for Intelligence and Related .

Military Situations" under a
freedom of information proceduie.

According to that study. the Air
Force found that through the use of
hypnosis “Subjects can bespecifiesl-
ly trained in accord with their an-
ticipated military functions."

The paper says that hypnotic
techniques can be a valuable tool in
deproyamming enemy prisoners;
and that hypnotic counter-measures
can be employed to enable captured
U.S. prisoners to keep secrets from
enemy interrogators.

Miller says he has also learned

' that the military studied the applica-
tion of hypnosis to US. couriers
carrying highly-sensitive military
secrets; he says the couriers would be
instructed under hypnosis to repeat a
message to a contact—and then to
forget not only the message. but who
that contact was after the message
was delivered.

Miller says that the most in«
triguing element of all in the hyp-
nosis study is a reference to yet
another Air Force study that is still
classiﬁed. That other study. accor-
dingtothe hypnosis report, concerns
“other formsofinfluenceincluding .

. intra-cranal stimulation."

case in Galveston. Texas. was

after the victim inthe casestatedthat
the only unusual physical
