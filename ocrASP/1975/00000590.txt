.Publioation of gay poetry has been a veritable wasteland, even though Sappho. one of
history’s earliest and most famous poets, was 3 Lesbian. In the subsequent publication of gay
poetry. a homosexual content has often been masked throughoutrightchangingof pronouns by

publishers and poets alike.

Another common tactic used to deny homosexuality in poetry has been employed by critics.
professors and ’othcr interprctors of this medium. Although Whitman‘s Calamut poems are
hardly subtle in their homosexual implications. their meanings have been drowned by
overanxious English teachers who have substituted the pretext of mere male comcraderie to
justify lines such us "And his arm lay lightly around my [Whitman's] breast—and that night I was

happy."

Poetry has been called The Voice of the Oppressed. Having hccncxcluded fromthe media, we
have been denied the right to vicariously experian the catharsis‘of our feelings. Consequently.
this has intensiﬁed our need to actively express these feelings for ourselves. The poetry that

follows represents a glimpse into the souls of some SUNYA gays.

 

 

 

Behind Closed Doors

That‘s where they stick us.

To them we are obsolete,
Something to hide; to put away
Until they want to display us.
Like one big side show.

I want to be free

Of my imprisonment

To be able to scream

At the top of my voice,

I am Gay and I want to be.

IN THE DISTANCE

As I sit on the shore and watch
The white sail in the distance
Softly gliding across the panoramic screen
That is the sea and the sky,

I think of you on that last day

When I saw you at dawn.

How I longed to hold you once more!
How I longed for one last kiss!

I noticed your eyes

Rcd from no sleep and too much drink
Filling with tears

But we stopped short:

Two men dare not display such emotion.

Closing my eyes
I remember’the night we met,
The first time we kissed.
Opening my eyes
I see your car pulling from the drive.
Slowly sinking. as the white sail in the distance.

My love has long golden hair. she
ls like a dream and the fairy tales
Of yesteryear, to live

Charming w o sweeps me olf my feet
Into her {till '10 bosom, 0 ©

To protect.
Love, 0 00*

When my love looks at me. I am the

Most beautiful woman. In her eyes

I am hers. and she is everything

In mine. My eyes are engulfed

With every beautiful line and curve of her
Body. For she is all the goodness and love
In the world and . . . I love her.

She walked into my life one August day and
Since then I have never been the same.

I discovered the world

And now [want to share it with her.

Woman. She has broken down
The barrier of our sexes, for

I am

A woman

And so is she

And I am

Proud

That she is mine and I am hers.
I love her as I love life.

Blooming in the night

Hidden from the light,

We must hide.

We are your children—like you
But with different needs.

Or we will die

Do not ignore us
Or we will die
Hungry for your care.

What are we afraid of?

The shadows and the darkness?
Is society so blind that

They can not see the

Light from our Gay hearts?

 

We are people. human beings

_Who feel the same, Bleed over the hurts.
‘. Why should we be labeled as queer
When we are the same,

Even though We love differently?

I Should We be punished
For their dark narrow minds,
/ When we inhabit all walks or stem light.
