MFBob Dylan: §

Commercial

by Spence Ragglo .
The Niagara Falls Convention

stands apart from the motels and restaurants
of the city. It‘s a steel and glass airplane hangar
sitting on a concrete island and unlike the sur-

rounding city. is spotlessly clean.

Niagara Falls was once a city for lovers. the
honeymoon capitals of the world. A complete
romantic fabrication, a carnival of costumes
and masks played against the ceaseless

thundering rush of the water.-

But now. as romanticism itself is rejected, its
high gloss slowly tarnished; Niagara Falls is
dying. And winter in the city only serves to

emphasize its death.

So it is here that the Rolling Thunder Revue
chose to stop and enact the rejuvenation ofthe
American Folk Dream. Bob Dylan. Joan
Baez. Joni Mitchell. Roger McGulnn, Mick
Ronson. Ramblin‘ Jack Elliott—these are the
biggest names of a musical decade, all banded

words of Tom Lehrer:

Guitars are the weapons we bring
We all hate poverty war and injustice
Ready. . . Aim . . . Sing!

It's depressing to see all the fourteen year
olds gathered around the convention center;
they are the ones who havecorne to see a show.
the ones who will buy the Bob Dylan shirts
from the hawkers out in the parking lot. They play.

Even Dylan isn‘t big enough to sell out two

. . .or Mysterious Prophet?

by Karen Schlosberg

Heading out for the east coast;
Lord know: I've paid some dues.
Gettin' through.

Tangled up in blue.

Work notwithstanding, I was off
to Buffalo. A friend had gotten me a
ticket to see Bob Dylan and his Roll-
ing Thunder Revue. Perhaps a once
in a lifetime chance to see the man.

I couldn't believe that l was going
to see Dylan. The mysterious
prophet. the “original vagabond"

sings Joan Baez in “Diamonds and
Rust." And there were rumors of
Joni Mitchell floating around.

The Niagara Convention Center is
reminiscent of Nassau Coliseum in
all of its worst characteristics. but
smaller. I was disappointed. because
l had heard that Dylan was makinga
tour of smaller halls. that his Revue
was designed for the intimacy of
places like the Other End or the Bot-
tom Line in New York City.

There were people swarming
everywhere. Some were my age, and

some looked as ifthey had beenwith
Dylan since the beginning; I hoped
that they had the best seats, they
deserved them.

We were herded in, checked and
searched. then given dirty looks by
the redneck ushers as we were seated.
These short-haired men in jackets
were pushing people around un-

at innocent passcrsby. Againl wish-

The lights went down suddenly.
and just as suddenly there was a
band playing. People were confused;
muttering and asking, “Is he up
there'F'. But he wasn't. It was only
Bobby Neuwirth and his band,
Guam. wasting our time for about a
half an hour. doing a mediocre im-
itation of Dylan. and pretendingthat
he wasjust as. if not moreimportant
than. Dylan himself. His standard
opening line, “Welcome to your liv-
ing room." fell ﬂat and seemed
ludicrous in the cavernous depths of
the Convention Center.

They were joined by Ronee
Blakley of Nashville fame. who was
off-key but still had a pleasant voice.
She turned the stage over to a
"friend." The rumors were true.

Joni Mitchell walked onto the
stage amidst thunderous applause.

A band walked in, unannounced, and, while
the words “Welcome to your living room"

the band~Guam—and. later on. the names of
the individual musicians. among them Bobby

The Rolling Thunder Revue tour was. from intermi

As Ramblin‘ Jack Elliott came out
I wondered when the concert was
really going to start. Where was
Dylan? It was hard to comprehend
how much Dylan was only a part of
the Rolling Thunder Revue; maybe
because the fact that Dylan could be
anything but Dylan—alone. and by
himself—was unacceptable. Dylan
said long ago in an interview. “It
strikes me funnythat peopleactually
have the gall to think that l have
some kind of fantastic imagination.
It gets very lonesome."

Her voice has mellowed and lost a lot
