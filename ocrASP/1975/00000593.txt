 hasn't had a big hit since
' ‘- {‘Carefree Highway” about a' year
‘ ago. and 'despite the rough time he

had here last year, all titre of his per-
formances at ' New .York’s Avery
Fisher Hall were sold out. No fuss.
no riots. no screaming teenyboppers.

fThinkOod. He may never an any
sireeordsfor fastest sell out. but he will
always sell out. .

There is a hard-core youp of
Lightfoot freaks hiding in their
closets inthe New York area who
come out when he gives his “only
New York concert appearances of
the season," as the ads run.

-I came down from my closet in
Albany wondering how the New
York audiences would receive him
after Isis infamous “bummer in the
Big Apple" of last December.

I never thought I could act this
way

And I've got to say that I just
don't get it . . .

He had iwo shows last December
on a Friday night. and during the
middle of the second show he
became disgusted with the poor
sound system (his own) and left the
stage. not to return. An un-
precedented occurrence for Light-
.foot. who was never known for
temper tantrums. He had never been
popularenough hereinthe Statesto
be able to afford them. The Sunday
following that show he apologized
during the matinee, which was nice,
but it,didn't much help those who
had been there on Friday.

I sat in my seat listening to

people’s'eohversations. but no one

said anything about last year. All

they were talking’about was Bob ‘

Dylan. and the girls behind me were
becoming dreamy over Don
McLean's “bedroom eyes.“

When you make the new:

You don't" have to hang it on

_ your wall. . .

One of the nicest things about a

Lightfoot concert was always the

. fact that you never had to sit through
a horrendous forty-five minute,

openerthat takestiine away from the
main performance. lGuess again.
This year there was an opener-J
Mimi Farina. the widow of
Richard Farina. but perhaps better
known as Joan Baez's sister. Her
appearance seemed to be a personal

' favor. not an agency-arrangedthing.

I heard grumbles among the restless
natives, and I knew that this would
be a hard audience for any opener
for iightfoot, friend or not.

As it turned out. she was very
good; so much so that I hardly
begrudgea her the eight or so songs
that Lightfoot would have sung had
she not beenthere. Comingfrom me,
one of the best closet-hiders around,
that's a big compliment.

She seemed to be nervous. which
could easily be understood knowing
the mood of the audience. But her
voice was rich and full and mostly
free of that nervous vibrata that is
Baez‘s trademark. She sang eight
which were her compositions. but all
were well-suited to her style and her
were well suited to her style and her
«voice. I was especially pleased with
her version of Elton John's“DanieI."

done effectively in a folk/guitar
style.
The rest of the audiencewasn't as

generous, however. and though.

there seemed to be a few Mimi
Farina freaks out there, I heard a lot
of negative remarki during the
break.

That was forgotten in the general-
ly explosive applause that welcomed
Lightfoot's appearance on the stage.
Their enthusiastic—to say the
least—response rather surprised me.
He was also greeted withashower of
gifts. presented by groups of people
coming up to the stage, makingtheir
small pilgrimage to a Mecca of sorts.

Sometimes I think it's ashame
When I get feeling better when
I'm feeling no pain. . . '

The presents included two bottles
of what appeared to be whiskey,
probably Canadian. He has a
reputation that last year he called
“well-deserved" for being fond of the
stuff, although lately. in what few in-
terviews he does. he seemed to be
eager to shed that image.

He opened immediately with a
new song called “Race Among the
Ruins.” then proceeded to sing for
about an hour and a half straight—
no breaks, no talking or story-
telling. which, though unusual for
him. was ﬁne for us. He explained
later during the concert that that was
done to preserve time. because". . .
talking and making jokes is one
thing. but making music is another."

And he made a lot of excellent
music during that time. Most of his
material came from the albums he

has recorded with Warner
Bron/Reprise. who he's been with
since I970. when he had his ﬁrst
American hit. “If You Could Read
My Mind.” The one exception was
the “Canadian Railroad Trilogy.” an
ever-popular song from his United
Artist days, dating back to I967.

His new songswere thoughtful.
sensitive pieces. on a par with “Seven
Island Suite" or “The Soul is the
Rock.” They seemed to be more
polished—lyrically. melodically.
and emotionally r- than were most of
the songs on his most recent album.
Cold on the Shoulder.

He has added a pedal steel
guitarist, Pee Wee Charles. to his
regular touting back-up ‘of lead
guitarist Terry Clements and bassist
Rick Haynes. two excellent
musicians. The steel adds to the full
sound without overwhelming it. It’s
used with style and talent, as was

at SUNYA

and

everything used by Ughtfoot in this
concert.

Even the lighting was used more
efﬁciently than usual, although there
were still the occasional unnecessary

. and annoying blackouts between

songs. As a red wash came on to set
the mood for “Sundown” I realized
that the designer had also had a sense
of humor.

All four of them seemed to be in
high spirits. with a lot of behind-the-
boss‘-back joking and making faces
between Clements and Haynes in
particular. While not loquacious.
Lightfootseemed cheerful and prone
to his back-up's mood of jocularity.

‘Rainy Day People."

and Lightfoot‘s voice was as smooth _

and as beautiful as I can ever
remember it being. He's come along
way from his days as a boy soprano
inthe church in Orillia. Ontario. His
voice has matured into what
someone called a "whiskey
baritone.“ and it isjust as important
andeffective a tool in expressing his
songs'rneanings as the Iyrirs and the
melody. And the sound was good.
All we need isfailh . . .
To make it nice
I don't want to know everything
you've done
If you‘re gonna make a mistake
Don't you make it twice . . .
After “Now and Then“ he

 

  

strummed s‘couple 'of chords and
said“l think the sounds going good
this time." and he received laughter
and applause for that understated
reference to last year‘s ﬁasco. This
year. it seemed. he was on his best
behavior in the Big Apple. And ob-
viously New York has forgiven him
his unsettled ways.

He closed the show with the
“Canadian Railroad‘Trilogy." a six-
minute song about the building of
the railroads in Canada. which is
now a classic; always requested and
sung at his concerts. He had given us
the choice between this and "Early
Morning Rain.“ While most of us
wanted to hear both. this. being a
longer song. won. One person in the
second row held up three ﬁngers. an
effective nonverbal way of com-
municating.

‘ ll

plete. that:even the ' ,

my favorite songs I hadn‘t  't
missing before. He received another '
standing ovation. just a warm as
before. but this time he simply came
out. bowed. and brushed hands with
the members of the audience stan-
ding at the edge of the stay.

In the program notes hesaid."‘l'm..
out there to create a focal point for
the audience . . . I try to set up a
coffeehouse atmosphere at center
stage. a small intimate space where.
everyone's thoughts are focused on
the same thing at the same time . . .
it‘s up to me to give out a good feel-
ing. musically. emotionally, sound-
wise and so one. I try never to ﬁve
my audience less than they expect.
nor do I ever takcthem for granted.“

This year he fully lived up to his
expectations. and at the same time.
erased last year‘s bad memory from
evcryone's mind. It‘s about time.
