twelve companions to explore this
unknown lend. The party soon
found the cave of the cyclops,
Poseidon's son Polyphemus, who
was out in the fields. Odysseus
restrained his men from pilfering
the cheeses and from driving off the

Upon returning, Polyphemus

short, in the next twenty-four hours
the anthropophagous habits of

Their inability " to understand
Polypheinus' plight if No-man had
done nothing to him?

It is now morning. The time is 36
hours after the ﬁrst two companions
had served as gustatory tidbits.
Throughout the cave tension
prevails. The surviving seven Greeks
must escape. Polyphemus must
remove the stone that blocks the en-
trance. Wily. resourceful Odysseus
has an idea. For some reason or
other—Homer too speculates—the
eyelops on the previous evening had
driven the rams as Well as the ewes
intothe cave, thereby providing exit
visas and transportation facilities for

' the penned-in Greeks.

Carefully removing the gigantic
stone that blocked the cave's en-
trance. Polyphemus allowed the
flock to pass singly through the
opening, while he carefully ran his
hands over the back of each animal
to see that it carried no rider.

clinging to the bellies of the larger
animals. passed by undetected.

There was almost a hitch at the
last moment. The ram who was
usually at the head of the flock was
the very last to pass through the
opening. Polyphemus‘ suspicions
were aroused: ‘Why are you. my pet.
the last of the sheep through the
cave?‘

The accompanying picture on the
vase in the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts adequately answers the ques-
tion. Odysseus was no light—weight.

Dylan seemed eager to shed
limeelf once and for all of the
prophet image that's been hounding
him, unwanted. since he ". . .burst
on the scene already a legend/The
unwashed phenomenon. . .“ of the
early sixties. Hence thelow proﬁle—
no star billing in the Rolling
Thunder Revue, no introduction at
all, no frills. Yet he was still evasive
and mysterious, as the self-imposed
white mask proved.

But during his time alone 'on the
stage, he showed again that he can-
not take himself seriously, and. more
importantly, wishes we wouldn't. As
he sat there, someone from the
depths of the audience succumbed to
the awe-inspiring urge to make
himself known tothis god-like per-
son. to identify, somehow, with
Dylan—so he shouted “Bob Dylan!
Bob Dylan!" And the man turned his
white face into the crows, hat on
head, and mumbled into the
microphone softly, almost to
himself, "No. I don't think so . . .
You must be mistaking me for
someone else.”

That was his answer to our
questions about him, the same
answer that he's had all during the
years. The paradox of his personali-
ty. He has always had a sense of the
absurd. especially when talking
about himself. In an old interview in
Austin. Texas, he was asked, “What
do you consider yourself? How
would you classify yourself!" and he
answered, “Well. l like to think of
myself in terms of a trapeze artist."

Perhaps I was mistaking him for
someone else.
