To the Eater:

A letter appeared in the November 2| edi-
tion of the ASPin which Mr. Jack Bensonac-
cused IFG of ripping off stupid people by
making them pay admission to the movies
while others get in free. This was a complaint
based on only one isolated incident. but let me
assure you. the problem is more widespread
than this. In defending IFG. it is imperative
that it be clearly understood that the deep-
rooted corruptionthat has pervadedthe youp
is the result of actions taken towards national
security. My most trusted aides have advised
me to coverup, but I feel arespoosibilityto
make a full disclosure of what I know on this
sensitive matter. -

The people that Mr. Benson saw sitting
around did get in for free, although they were
not IFG helpers as originally claimed. They
were members of the Czechoslovakian Olym-
pic team. who stopped here on their way to
Montreal when they heard we were showing a
Cuchoslovakian movie. He claims there were
around 25‘ofthem. Actually there were 7”.
but most of them were hiding underthedesks.
I. just today, learned the reason for this un-
usual behavior. Theythought Mr. Benson was
an agent from a foreign power who was spying
on them.

Ineffective Lobbying

To the “or:
Cutbacks in education are staring us in the

' face. We are facing larger classes, higher fees

and the dismantling of entire departments.
Many students are forced to leave school com-
pletely.

Increasing numbers of students see the need
to ﬁght these cuts. As an example, SASU
organized a lobbying and rally action in
Washington D.C. on Nov. l8 (covered in the
Nov. 2|. ASH. Unfortunately the main
emphasis was on lobbying to “save the City”
that is. to get a loan guarantee for the New
York banks. Nevertheless, many students saw
this activity as a way of saving our education.

Was Iobbyingthc most effective method we
can use? My own experience with lobbying
was not good. The SASU organizers split the
more than a thousand students who came
from all over SUNY, into small groups for
lobbying purposes. The group I was assigned
to never even saw either of the two Con-
gs'esspeople SASU had made appointments
for usto see. In one ofﬁce we didn't even see a
staff member — in the other one a staff
member spent about two minutes with us.
Clearly those in Congress aren't impressed
with small numbers.

There is another strategy we could have
used. In fact on Nov. l9. thousands of CUNY
students and three busloads of students from
SUNY at Binghamton demonstrated in
Washington. Their message was clear: we will
ﬁght attacks on our education on ‘a massive
basis. This strategy has provensuccessful. The
civil rights movement. the anti-war move-
ment. the women's movement. made gains
only after large numbers of people took to the
streets in legal. peaceful demonstrations:
When the powers that be saw hundreds of
thousands of people marching in the streets
they made concessions to these movements.
The movement to defend our right toquality
education will make gains only if we too
mobilize massive protests. The demonstration
of Nov. l9 was a step in this direction.

Most of those whom ltalked to at the Nov.
Ill SASU gathering didn't even know about
the Nov. l9 demonstration. A common reac-
tion when they found out about it war: why

 

 

a meeting d‘ tla's sort, we would be-in a
strongr positiontoﬂgbt splint all attach on

our education.

If the administration demands multiple copies

Why You’ll Never Be
Supercool

 

by lien Wax

 

What it all boils down to is that all anyof us
really wants is to be supercool. like those guys
in the movies. If only we could be as casually
cool and spectacularly slick as. say. Robert
Redford or Faye Dunaway. (If the movie
heroes you wish to emulate fall in the cadre of
Trigger, Lassie, Gentle Ben. etc. then perhaps
this article isn't for you. Instead of wasting
your time reading it. have a sugar cube in-
stead.)

But none of us are ever going to be super-
cool. and its not really our fault. The problem
is that real life simply does not have accom-
panying theme music. And one cannot have a
truly classy act without strategically timed
musical interludes to announce to the world
exactly what's going on.

In order to be supercool. everyone you pass
or meet must immediately know of your
coolness. even if they’ve never seen or heard of
you before. Now. many people Iryto convey
this through various means (fancy clothing.
mirror sunglasses. ordering ‘cool‘ drinks. etc.)
but it never works. because you can't shout
about your supercoolness and still remain
supercool.

Theme music. however. does the job
superbly.

On the screen. when Paul Newman walks
into a room. a full orchestra announces his
arrival with a booming dado-dado] Very im-
pressive indeed. How can I. casually making
my real life entrance to classrooms, parties.
and meetings. get this audio advantage?

Travelling around "1.2. r‘ _. L
is awkward at best. one has to hang around
while the musicians set up before one can do
anything. not to mention that putting a full
symphonyon the payroll is an expensive
endeavor. The best I'd be able todo would has
four piece Bar Mitzvah band. and I'm not sure
if having one‘s theme music led by on accor-
dion is all that cool anyway.

But life would be so much better with
proper orchestration.l’en_slve thought-filled
walks through the park take on a whole new
air of significance when accompanied by
Simon and Garfunkel playing Parsley, Sage,
Rosemary and Thyme invisibly in the

background. Meeting a stranger of the op-
posite sex in the library simply has to be more
fluid when a crooning saxophone permiates
the intial worthless conversation. Everyone in
the store would know of your dash through
the place, and not wanting to mess up the
music. would let you go right to the front of
the line without waiting

Some degree of mystery and speculation
would be gone from our lives with theme
music. If your melody faded out as you ap-
proached someone. you would know that your
upcoming interchange with that person is an
important one. Moans and orgasms would no
longer be mistaken for one another; either the
cymbals smash and bash and rock the room.
or a muted trumpet's woh-wah would an-
nounce the frustration.

Even complete disaster: such as ruined
dinners or ripped shopping bug would be more
palatable if accompanied by I Love Lucy
failed-escapade music; complete with all the
proper suspense peaks and disappointed
horns. Everything would be more spectacular.
more imponant. and more signiﬁcant if only
we had theme music in our day to day ac-
tivities.

0

But we can't. Even ifthc logistical problems
of traipsing around with an orchestra that I
spoke of earlier could be overcome. there
would still be plenty of problems. Fights
would occur over who could have which
theme. and even if that were smoothly resolv-
ed. the problem of having dozens of conflic-
ting ‘ 4' r ’ g with each other at
parties would have to be surmounted. There
would also be communication problems, what
does one do if the conductor leads the
orchestra in a mellow. passionate love song
when all you want to do is get away from the
person you're talking with?

Ah. it ain't gonna happen anyway. 'l‘hcme
musicjutt isn't made for real life. and we're all
destined to be at least a few notches below
supercool. The basic truth is that while Mary
Tyler Moore and Bob Ncwhnrt can listen to
their themes as they joyoust duncc through-
trufﬁc. the rest of us have to hear rumbling
trucks and honking carhorns. and watch out
for dog crop.

MIA: The Bracelets Are Rusting

All of us remember the dramatic return of
“IIII” our POW‘s in living color on national
tclevislon.Thc American public was led to
believe that the question was settled. This is
not the case. On January 23. I973 in the spiril
of bringing about a lasting peace. the Vietnam
Peace Agreement was signed in Paris. by the
parties of the United States of America. the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North). the
National Liberation Front (Vict Cong) and
the Republic of Vietnam (South). Included in
that agreement was Article 8 Paragraph ll
which related to facilitating the location and
care of graves of the dead. exhumation and
repurtriation of the remains as well as to ob-
tnin information on those still considered Mis-
sing In Action.

During the month of May I973. a four-
partyjoint military team visited the reported
grave sites ofthose mcn previously reported as
“having died in captivity." Following the visit.
the parties worked out the procedural re-
quirements for returning those remains and
our delegate requested curly repatriation. To
date this hasn't been accomplished.

But what ofthc l300 plus MlA's'l Mothers.
fathers. sisters. brothers. wives. children.
friends and relatives were left hanging In lim—
b0. No action was taken to remove the “miss-
ing” term from the fate of their men. The
North Vietnamese refused to allow search
teams in. nor would they allow identified
remains to be released.

Both Presidents Nixon and Ford had pledg-
ed to obtain an "honorable" accounting III one
time or another. To date nothing has been
done. Since January I973. 509 presumed fIn-
dinpl of death have whittled downthc number
0i MIA-POW's to 758 MIA's due to hostile
action. and another 69 MlA's due to non-
hostile action. This is the Dcfcnb'e
Department's latest ﬁgures. Included in that

list is thc number 36 followed by (he designa-
tion POW.

POW. But we were told that "all" our men
had come home and yet here we have on of-
ﬁcial branch of our government acknowledg-
Ing the existence of 36 men as prisoners of war.
To try to resolve this issue in question the
National League of Families of American
Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia was
formed. For many years they have worked to
help bring back our POW‘s and to obtain an
accounting for our MIA‘s. Many people
remember Ihcm for their symbols the
bracelets with the names of Americans lost in
Vietnam. At that time they accomplished lit-
tle. Now. ﬁnally. the league has decided to do
something about it.

a

No longer are they going to remain passive.
Like the protesters ofthc 60‘s demonstrations
and marches are being organized. They are
takingthcir cause to thcstrcets. Onthe l lth of
November. Veterans Day. II vigil was held in
front of the White House calling for. among
other things. It full accounting of our men.
Every American is being urged tojoin in this
protest. We mustshow our lcudcrsthnt we will
not abandon those men still MIA-POW. As a
second part of the Protest the Ilth was set
aside as Swamp a Swi/chbaorrl For Your
American Brothers Day. Everyone was urged
to send Muilgrums. telegrams. or make phone
calls to President Gerald R. Ford. requestinga
full accounting of our men.

This issue isn't one of rightncss or
wrongncss ofthc war. It's simply an attempt to
erase the question mark surrounding the fate
of Ihcsc men. If you want to help make next
Veterans Day the last one that this puttlc
remains unsolved do something. Join in with
many other concerned Americans and let your
voice be heard!

Student control of Faculty-Student Association (FSA) can mean both cominued

»  . ﬁnancial stability for the campus service corporation and increased responsiveness to I
student needs. Students here have long felt that since they are the major contnbutorsto

‘ 1 FSA's income and the major users of its services they shouldhave control of tits
I v policies. '

The new president of the corporation, SA Controller Stu Klein. can beexpectetlto

"1 do an excellent job. Klein'has a well deserved reputation for good judgement and
‘ integrity. The other members of the student-controlled Board of Directors can also

A,- serve their function well.

The effect of student control on the Board is not yet clear, though it has already

V r taken action to eliminate the Campus Center barbershop and replace it withafood co-
 op. SA‘s failure last year to convince FSA to make this reasonable change was the
a major cause of the frustration that led to the successful effort tocontrol the Board.

Students on the Board should recognize the efﬁcient systems of FSA General
Manager Norbert Zahm and that their primary role is to insure the effective

functioning of FSA:

But there are other considerations imponant to students involved. Student
participation in the control of all university functions is at stake. If FSA. can thrive
financially under students as it did before. and also provide more imaginative serVIce,
the regard for student abilities within the university community will increase. Alarger
say in the health. security and. of course. the academic functions of the umversIty
Would then be possible. And that would be in everybody’s interests.

Get a Horse

It is somewhat annoying when a service as essential to the university as uptown-
downtown bus service is threatened because ofthc present ﬁscal crisis. Vice President
for Management and Planning John Hartley has made no firm decision in the matter
yet. but th' anyone in the administration would even consider cutting bus service
reflects miiihkcn priorities.

l-lurtlcy says that he is not in control of ﬁscal pressures brought upon SUNYA by
SUNY Central, Governor Carey and the state legislature. He is correct. but reason
dictates that if cuts have to be made. they must be made where they will do the least
damage.

Reducing the number of bus runs will do far more damage than cutting a
maintenance man or an administrator. Indeed. the bus service is more thanthelifeline
to education for thousands of students living off-campus, on Alumni and in the
Wellington Hotcl. It is transponation to the capitol district. an essential service ifthis
university is to increase its involvement in state affairs as President Fields has indicated

would be desirable. - . ' I
Yesterday‘s march of approximately 500 hundred students at the administration

building was impressive for the age of apathy. and indicates that this issue is of upmost
importance to SUNYA‘s student body.

There is a freeze on new appointments and other complications but we are conﬁdent
that SUNYA's administration can do what‘s necessary to keep those buses rolling.
