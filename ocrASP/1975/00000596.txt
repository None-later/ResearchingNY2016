When the Albany Great Danes
wrestling team takes to the mats
Saturday for a quadrangular meet
against RPI, Oneonta and Union
College, Albany will ﬁeld a very
young and inexperienced team.

With only four returnees from last
year‘s squad. it will be a rebuilding
year for the Great Danes, according
to coach Doug Porter.

“We lost some pretty good
wrestlers to graduation," said
Potter. “In addition. some guys we
thought would come out for the
team did not and this has hurt us.”

However Porter did indicate that
he thought the Danes were capable
of a .500 year. while hoping to ﬁnish
ﬁfth in the SUNY conference.

Porter said the top two teams in
the conference will be Cortland and
Binghamton. Porter also holds
perennial SUNY powerhouses Os-
wego State and Potsdam State in
high regard.

State's wrestling card shapes upin
this manner.

Manuel Cruz. a transfer student
from CCNY. will get the nod in the
118 pound class. Cruz has never
wrestled before but is quick and
strong. and Porter calls him a "quick
learner."

At I 26. freshman Gary I’erber will
do the honors.

I “Gary comes from a good high
school background and has an ex-

lcellcnt knowledge of all wrestling

moves." said Porter.

Brad lieilly. a senior. will be there
if Fcrber has trouble with collegiate
competition. ‘

Freshmen Sam I‘ischetti and

 

' r

Tony Pugliese will battle it out all
season long for the 134 pound slot.

Vic Gagliardi. back from last
year‘s squad. is a three year veteran
and will lend some stability to the
young team.

“Vic is one of the most dedicated
members on the team." said Poner.
“and as a result has shown vast im-
provement since last year.”

Kevin Schiatta. a transfer from
Potsdam State. will become eligible
for the second semester giving the
Danes some much needed depth in
the I42 pound weight class.

Jim ﬁrm will wrestle in the ISO
pound slot and coach Porter expects
“big things" from him.

Firm is a freshman and comes to
Albany by way of Chaminade High
School. where he was team captain
and most valuable player.

Behind him is Nick Zuhlake. a
junior. who Porter calls “a late
bloomer."

“Nick is a very strong wrestler but
needs work on his moves," said
Porter.

In addition. next semester the
Danes will have the services of (iabe
Natarelli. a transfer student who has
to sit this semester out.

The I58 pound class belongs to
captain .Iack D‘Amhrosio. D'Am-
brosio has been bothered by a nagg-
ing knee injury but is expected to be
ready for Saturday.

If I)‘Ambrosio‘s knee acts updur-
ing the year then the job will fall into
the hands of freshman 'Iint O‘Con-
nor. an unproven commodity who
has never wrestled.

Earl Jordan. who should be a
stand ottt according to I’orter. isthc

(Wébuilding Year’ For Wrestlers L

 

leading contender forthe I77 pound
class.

“Earl is very strong and comes
from a solid wrestling background.”
said Porter. '

Behind Jordan is Bob DeSantis.
who is developing very quickly. but
he has never wrestled before.

The I90 pound class will be
topped by returning sophomore
Chris Covas. and when he is not
available freshman Dave Mathas
will get the call.

Tyrone Quinn will handle the
heavy weight division forthe Danes.

Tyrone has good balance and is
very strong. according to Porter.

Looking to the Danes opening
match this Saturday. l’orterfeels the
Danes are capable of beating both
Oneonta and R Pl but will encounter
some problems with Union. as the
Dutchmen are coming off a 24-l7
victory over Cornell.

The match is at Albany and is
scheduled for l p.m.

The Albany StateWomen‘s Gym-
nastics team ﬁnished second in a
triangular men. November 22. in
their season opener at Green Moun-
tain Commurtity College.

Competing in four events (the
balance beam. the unevens. vaulting.
and floor exercise) the team got off
to a “very good start.” according to
Coach Edith Cobane. -

“We are very stronginthe vaulting
and uneven events,“ said Cobane.
“we only need to pick up a few more
points in our balance beam scoring“

The twelve-woman team. con-
sisting mainly of freshmen. promise
a successful season according to
Cobane. Competing against
Castleton. Vermont and Green
Mountain colleges. the young team
managed to keep its balance long
enough to split their Division I com-
petition, and takctwo out ofthrccin

Outstanding routines were div

considered Olympic ability.)

“Cathy Caperna‘s routine would

well.“

Mcrce cnscna 1nglcs” and “Santa Clo va a la Cuchilla,”

American culture that is invading the Island. His
satirical point of vic w, ofthis crash, gives us some funny
situations that in reality arc tragic events.

the theater of these two short-stories under the title of
“Santa Clo va a la Cuchilla.”
