Harriers: “14th Winnins,,,.Season>.In‘   

If by  Lafayette

At the start'of Albany‘s I975
cross-country season. Coach Bob
Munsey looked at his young squad

and the team's toughest schedule in

its history. and said. “I’m not sure
how. but we’ll have our usual strong
season again this year. I wouldn‘t be
surprised if two or more freshmen
make the varsity."

Munsey had fairly accurately

' predicted the way the season would

shape up for his team. The team's
dual meet record was 6-4. the
fourteenth consecutive time they
have been above the .500 mark.
The team collected its wins against
Vermont; Coast Guard; Siena. RPI.
and Union in the Capital District
Championships; and scored a major
upset by ripping Colgate. The losses
came to tough schools: Army.
Syracuse. Boston State. and
Williams. (The schedule will con-
tinue to be top notch as Albany.
Syracuse. and Army have agreed to

ATTENTION:

an annual triangular. which Albany
is scheduled to host next year.)

In multi-team competition, the
harriers were runners up to
Plattsburgh in the S.U.N.Y.A.C‘s. a
dissapointing ﬁfth in the Albany In-
vttational. and “made the season a
success“ by placing ﬁfth in the
I.C.A.A.A.A. Championships.

“When [assistant coach] Pat
Glover told me about the results I
almost fell over." said Munsey. “We
had been inconsistent in our meets
this year, and Eric Jackson. normal-
ly our seventh or eighth man. came
out of nowhere."

Jackson stuck in front and did not
give any ground as he won “All-I.C.
4A“ honors. ﬁnishing iwcntyﬁfth.

Captains Chris Burns (Ihth) and
Carlo Cherubino (19th) also won
I.C. 4A honors. the most Albany
runners ever so honored. Cheruhino.
who provided this year's highlight by
winning the Albany Invitational in
record time. dropped from It tie for

the lead after a blazing 4:30. ‘
Cherubino. the only graduating
senior on the team. is training for the
Italian, Olympic team as a
marathoner.

Saturday. Cherubino‘tied for ﬁrst
in the Philadelphia Marathon with
Larry Fredrick. who was Albany
State‘s Cross-country captain in
l97l. Winning in 2 hours and 26
minutes has to be a big conﬁdence
booster in his drive forthe Olympics.
In that race. coaches Pat Glover and
Gary Furlong ﬁnished 24th and 5 lth
representing the Albany Track Club,
which ﬁnished fourth.

Chris Burns and Brian Davis had
good seasons as they alternated in
the second slot for Albany. In addi-
tion to his strong showing in the
I.C.4A.s. Burns had a tremendous
race at Army where he trailed only
Curt Altir. (second inlhe LCAA un-
iversity division championships) and
Dennis Trudjillo (all-American last
year) of Army. and scored a win vs.

played a major part in this season.
Keith Benmaii and KevinBurnett
were the team’s usual fourth and
fifth men. Benman was named
“runner of the meet” three times this
season and Barnett twice. Munsey
was very pleased with their showing
in the |.C.4A‘s as “they stayed in the
thick of it the whole way.” Benman

.ﬁnished 59th and Burnett 67th.

Next year. with only Cherubino

“We've got several new kids in-

hope some of them are accepted."
