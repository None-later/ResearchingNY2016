Smooth Staton Winston‘s 30
points, many the dim: result of
spectacular passes from Winston
Royal, led a balanced ninaman
Albany State Junior Varsitybasket-
ball attack which handed coach Bill
Austin his ﬁrst collegiate victory in
as many tries, an 81-80 win over

. RPl's JVs Wednesday at University

Gym. «

Winston, a 6-2 Detroit University
transfer, hit 20 second half points,
took down i I rebounds and blocked
2 shots as he gave notice to front-line
varsity players that he may be
pushing them for a job before long

“Winston is the man we go to
when we need a hoop.” Austin said
in. a happy locker room after the
game. “Tonight he exerted himself
whenever things got tight."

If Winston is Mr. Inside on this
Pupteam. then Mr. Outside must be
Winston Royal, a 5'9 Brooklyn
product who dazrled the crowd with
his heady passing and smart ball
handling. Royal had 14 points and 8
assists to lead the backcourt.

“Royal's a good one, no doubt
about it," assistant coach Rich
Kapner said. “He's a very intelligent
player, the type of guy who's good to
have when you get in trouble."

Albany fans should get used to
seeing JV players shuttling in and
out of the lineup, it's a Bill Austin
trademark to play everybody.

“I have ten guys I have con-
ﬁdence in." the coachsaid. “Andthe
only real way to ﬁnd out if someone
can do the job is to give him floor
time. You only learn properly by
mistakes you make in game

\

situations."

First on the boardth season for ,

the Pups was Dave Landry. a 6‘3
forward from nearby Cohoes. Bra
after only 5 minutes of play, every
starter had scored as Albany opened
up a 12-6 lead.

The two teams traded hoops most
of the ﬁrst half, once RPI closingto
trail 27-26 at the 5:40 mark, before
Winston and Royal got their act
together to spark a l4-5 Albany
spurt which left the Pups ahead 44-
32 at intermission.

RPI proved stubborn as they
charged out of the locker room to
outscore Albany 18-8 and close to
within 2 points. 5260, at the “:15
mark of the second half.

“We started playing helter-skelter
in the second half," Austinsaid. “We
had guys standing around and there
was some oneon—one. play out
there that was ridiculous.”

The Engineers scored their only tie
of the game, (Albany never trailed)
at 58-58 midwaythrough the period.
But then Winston, as hiscoach said,
exerted himself. He scoredtwo quick
hoops. one a snowbird courtesy of a
down and out pass from guess who,
Winston Royal. Royal then added a
bucket of his own and Albany lead
66-60.

“Overall I'm pleased with the out-
come," the coach said. “I'm most
happy for the kids, happy they were
able to get off onthe right foot. They
made your typical ﬁrst game mis-
takes, but so did the coach“

There were a few oddities in this
curtain raiser. For instance. no“ foul
shots were attempted by either team
until the 7:37 mark of the ﬁrst
period. When the Pups did go to the

Terry Miles, a 6‘5 pivot man from
BulIalo was called for goal tending
three times as well as being hit with
the ﬁrst technical of the season for

Miles had 9 points and lo

Mike Voliton scored 7. Carney and

Grabowski and Cal Battle added 2.

Saturday Albany takes its 1-0
record to West Point where the Pups
will face the Cadets of Army. And as
Bill Austin warns. Albany will beina

struggle.

“They‘ll try to beat us up physical-
ly and they always get the whistles
down there. But I think we'll have
some surprises for them.”
