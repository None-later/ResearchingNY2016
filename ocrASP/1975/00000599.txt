By the end it was a travesty. The
score had grown to a ridiculous 86-
53 andthe only dramathht remained I
for the'near-empty University Gym
crowd was whether or not Fresh
Steve Maeklin could score. The
Albany State Great Danesjust didn‘t
beat the Coburg, Australia basket-
ball team, they made the Aussies
look like your friendly
neighborhood St. Rose All-Stars.

The two teams exchangedgifts
( stationery: for them, boomerangs
for Albany), in ceremonies before
the game. As it turned out, the
Aussies didn't do much to merit a
letter back home on ihcir new
stationary.

“They were pretty physical and
that's about all," Albany‘s guard

Gary Trevett said after the rout. .

“it was a good tune up for Cor-
tland on Saturday,” said Albany var-
sity basketball coach “Doc” Sauers.
“They simply missed a lot of good
shots early while we were on. After

that it was all over." .

Frosh Barry Cavanaugh scored
ﬁrst and from there-the Danes were
on their way to prove international
diplomacy does not carry overtothe
basketball court. '

The Danes proved to be most un-
gracious hosts as they blew the
{visitors out early, jumping to an 8-0
advantage and stretching their lead
to 26-8 after only 8 minutes of play.
it was a case of Albany quickness
and . the Aussies" lack of it which
proved the difference. Gary Trevett
repeatedly beat Coburg upcourt on
fast breaks.

When Albany missed, junior
transfer Victor Caesar, a 6‘3 leaper
who jumps center, and Cavanaugh,
who drew praise from Sauers for his
play in his ﬁrst collegiate game, were
usually there outhustling Coburgfor
the rebound.

“Barry is coming along real well,"
Sauers said afterwards, “And Victor

Super hit his ﬁrst four shots to help
Albany break quickly. Captain Bob
Audi had an even dozen, as did
Trevctt. All of Gary‘s l2 points came
in the first half.

Frosh Brian Barker,of whom the
coach says, “Is making freshman
mistakes, but will still be a-good
one," took over whereTrevett left off
by scoring all of his ll points in the
ﬁnal 20 minutes.

A trio of front line reserves. Dave
Lanuhan. Simon Steckel and Eric
Walton, also played well. Walton es-
pecially came to life in the game's
ﬁnal minutes.

Defensively, the Danes played a
patient man-to—man which bottled
up Coburg‘s deliberate game and
forced the visitors to attempt many
long range, outside shots.

“After the half I wanted us to slow
down and take advantage of certain
situations out there," Sauers said
later. “i don't like the idea of every
man for himself out there."

The Albany State women‘s inter-

record to 9 wins and l loss by
defeating Schenectady Community
College last week, winning the first
two games ofthe match 15-2 and IS-

by Craig Bell

“It's awfully hard to do an encore
aftera 9-0 season, but i thinkalot of
coaches would be happy to ﬁnish
with a 7-2 record." said Albany
Great Danes football coach Bob
Ford.

“If you could take away the
pressure of winning and losing, and
just concentrate on each kid becom-
ing the football player he is capable
of becoming and the team becoming
all they are capable of becoming,
ihenl think we reached these goals in

the last game of the year against

Springﬁeld College."

The Danes had their ups and
downs all year long, but they ﬁnally
piledlinto a cohesive unit in that
season ﬁnale.

Albany opened the season with a
19" victory versus Alfred, a game
which resulted in Orin Grifﬁn being
named as the ECAC Player-of-thc
Week.

way that they were thirty-three
points better than us.”

The Danes rebounded by
defeating Brockport and RIT, but
did not play up to their potential.

in the Brockport encounter, half-
back Orin Grifﬁn rushed for 235
yards in only one half of action and
was again voted the ECAC Player-

' of-the-Week.

The Danes followed with a big,
come-from-behind win, defeating
Southern Connecticut, l9-l7. The
game, played at New Haven, sawthc
Danes fall behind l5-0 onlyto come
storming back in a torrential dowu—
pour to grab the lead and then hold
on as the Owls tried to pull it out at
the last second. Fullback Tom
DeBlois was the big gun in this one
for State as he ran for 95 yards.

Back home against Norwich Un-
iversity, again in the pouring rain.
the Danes again found themselves
on the short side ofthe score and had
to rally for a [9-12 victory.

Then come what Ford called "the
most frustrating game of the year, as
the Danes lost to the Albright Lions,
2843. '

Albany fumbled the ball deep in

their own territorythe first two times ~

they had possession and Albright
went in for two early scores and
never looked back as the Danes real-

ly never got into the ball game.

“The Albright game was a classic
example of two evenly matched f oot-
ball teams," Ford said. “One made a
lot of mistakes, the other didn't.”

The Danes had an easy time the
next week as they shot down the
Plattsburgh Cardinals, 66-l2. Dave
Duprcy got his ﬁrst start of the year
and galloped 202 yards, good for
three touchdowns.

This set the stage for the season
ﬁnale against Coach Ford's alma
mata. the Springﬁeld Chiefs.

The Danes put on their finest
offensive show of the year, ac-
cumulating 527 yards on offense. in-
dividual honors in this game had to
go to fullback Torn DeBlois, whoset
three new Albany Statcrecords as be
rushed for 286 yards on 36 carries
and scored ﬁve touchdowas.

“Looking back onthc year. lthink
we proved that we can exist on this
new level of competition," said Ford.
“We'll be losing a lot of key players
to graduation." he continued, "but I
think we have a good nucleus of ball
players returning and that we will be
a solid ball club next year."

Professor Mutton-Urges 
Administrative Cast Cuts

by Doug Horwitz

Political Science Professor Ber-
nard K. Johnpoll has charged that
administrative and non-teaching
operative costs forthe SUNYA cam-
pus are exceedingly high. Based
upon a study which he began in l972,
Johnpoll concludes, in contrast with
the administration's ﬁgures, “Our
costs, in the system generally, are
way the hell too high—are the
highest in the United States for any
school."

Johnpoll has determined that over
7.4 million dollars (approximately
16%) of SUNYA‘s operative budget
is spent on non-teaching salaries
alone with millions more being spent
for overhead costs. “We are in es-
sence spending" Johnpoll said,
“somewhere in the vicinity of
between 25-32% on administration
 and it raises a serious question of
what is the purpose of the school."

in addition to these costs, John-
poll has ﬁgured that only one-third
of the budgetary money spent per
student is used for educational pur-
poses (teaching, library and
research). With regard to this ﬁ ndin g
Johnpoll remarked, “Now i am will-
ing to concede that here is a need for
expenditures on buildings and on
police and on administration which
can be very high. But ldon't think it
makes sense that the cost for all these

things together is almost double the
cost of education.”

.Johnpoll is convinced that
"tremendous cuts can be made at the
higher administrative level” without
loss to administrative efﬁciency.
Having done a comparativs analysis
between the University of Wisconsin
and SUNYA Johnpoll has found
considerable differences. He said,
“They used the same people at a
much lower ﬁgure, their ad-
ministrative costs are very much
lower. 1 think that‘s why they‘ve had
as good a school as they‘ve had."

Johnpoll, who admits to being
violently anti-bureaucratic and the
administration’s chief critic, said, “i
would like to see a major cutback. I
think serious consideration ought to
be given to cutting back on the
number of deans we have and the
number of vice-presidents. i really
think there ought to be a president
and a vice-president without any
staff except for a secretary each. and
then maybe one or two deans. We
really don't need any more."

Speaking for the administration.
John Hartigan. Assistant Vice
President and Controller, has said
with regard to Johnpoll’s ﬁndings,
“i’ve heard. what i considerpwild
charges made on the floor of the

Senate ...vl can't really relate to what,

he's saying or referencing‘because l

don't know what he's talking about.”
it is Hartigan's belief that Johnpoll
has not substantiated his ﬁndings
with any ﬁgures. “Other than saying
something, I haven't seen anything"
the Vice President said, asking,
“where are his ﬁgures?"

Johnpoll claims to have all the
ﬁgures and appears anxious to
divulge them. “for not as un-
reasonable as people think i am on
this,” remarked Johnpoll, adding “1
use their ownﬁgures, l have never
devised my own. it was their Internal
Research Bureau that came up with
these ﬁgures When I have a chance
i will appear before a committee of
the Senate and I will talktothem. N
be very glad to appear if they give me
a special date and I‘d give them the
ﬁgures."

It. is Johnpoll's hope that he not

' become involved'in a battle against

 

the administration. “I don't think
this ought to be a head-to-head con-
frontation, this ought to be a
dialogue," said Johnpoll.

He said of his study which has cost
hint both time and money “I think
l‘m doing a necessary function for
the good of the University—l may be
dead wrong but in raising this issue

‘ I‘m doing necessary work for the Un-

iversity. I know most administrators
don‘t agree because their jobs are on
the line  apparently somebody is
frightened and is trying to make it a
confrontation.”

John Hartigan says he is not look-
ing for a confrontation, what he
wants are speciﬁcs. Hanipn main-
tains, “We‘re pretty open here  it
would be worthwhile having people
that think they know better than we
do, to come and give the facts and
then address'those facts."

Doubts Voiced Over Student-Controlled FSA

by Stephen Dzlnanka

The future of the student-
controlled FSA is a bright one, ac-
cording to student leaders. However
both the corporation's general
manager and its former president
fear that a lack of continuity on the
FSA Board of Directors could create
problems.

The student-dominated Board of
Directors Wednesday elected SA
Controller Stu Klein FSA president,
completing SA‘s play for control of
FSA.

FSA General Manager E. Norbert
Zahm feels the biggest problem will
be a large turnover of people on the
Board of Directors. Student

change periodically as students
graduate and are replaced by new
students entering the university.
“That makes it hard for management
to plan ahead." said Zahm.

Zahm is worried about the
students‘ ability to make long-term
decisions and those involving large
amounts of money.

Annual Problem

Vice President for Management
and Planning John Hartley, the
former FSA president, said there is a
problem in annually re-educating
the new student directors about the
budget and business operations.

FSA is a multimillion dollar
business. it operates a number of un-
iversity services such as check
cashing and cafeterias. “These are
complications which take a little

time to learn about," said Hanley.

“i don‘t think it‘s a problem," said
the newly elected Klein. He feels
there are enough students who aren't
graduating and who could returnfor
another term on the Board.

Five of the eight undergraduates
on the Board are seniors. This in-
sures a turnover of more than half
the students on the Board.

Klein did, however, stress the im-
portantce of holding Board meetings
early in the year to familiarize new-
comers with FSA.

Central Council Chairperson
David Coyne is more skeptical. “it's
a real problem that there will be
some lack of continuity." said
Coyne. “We'll just have to do our
best to communicate things early in
the year." Coyne cited extensive ﬁl-

M

ing, making information available
from year to year, as important to
the success of the studentvdominated
Board, Coyne said Zahm will hold
meetings with the directors to give
them some background on the
history of the corporation.

SA Vice President Rick Meckler
feels that some administrative
perspective is needed to provide the
Board with background on FSA.
Meckler hopes to see a lot of discus-
sion between students. faculty
member, and administrators on the
Board. “it's not that we can pass
anything we want, although we can,
don't get me wrong. Now they (ad-
ministrators and faculty members)
have to listen to our arguments and
convince us that we're wrong."

There are presently three ad-
ministrators. two facility members,
and nine students on the Board.

Klein is conﬁdent that students
will prove their competence in FSA.

“it will show the university, hopeful—

Zly. that students can act just as
responsibly as anybody else in run-
ning a corporation. Students can res-
pond better to student problems

than faculty or administrators . . .

They've been through it."
Faculty Concern
Hartley feels the faculty will show
concern over the Board's Wednes-
day decision to remove the
barbershop from the Campus
Center. He stressed that it is the
Board's intention to relocate the
barbershop if possible. “Every effort
will. be made to relocate the
barbershop," said Henley.
Student ofﬁcials pointed out that
a lack of available space cit-campus
could thwart the revivai of the
barbershop.

nd non-leading opardtee coda.

Both Hartiganand Johnpoll agree
that their budgetary ﬁgures don't
coincide because each is deﬁning ad-
ministrative costs differerlly. Har-
tigan said, “There are two sides and
everyone has their own conception
of things." Johnpoll deﬁned the two
conceptions as such, “They're trying
to make a very narrow definition of
administration, for tryingto make a
very broad deﬁnition.” .

Yet despite Johnpoll's broad
deﬁnition of administration, Har-
tigan maintains that non-teaching
costs at SUNYA aren't excessive. He
said, “This campus has not beefed up
administration to the extent that .
other centers have  The conscious
effort as I see it. is to put as much as
possible into the faculty, into the
number of instructional positions in
terms of faculty support." To sup-
- port his statement Hartigan alluded
to the recent audit in which the state
controller determined SUNYA was
undermanaged. “We could identify,
easily,” be noted, “at least thirty
more aministrative positions  we
need thirty more people to do what
they‘re telling us to do.”

Hartigan also doesn't see a need
for cutting back on the number of
deans as Johnpoll advocates. “Each
one of these schools is very very
specialized," Hartigan noted. “Per-
sonally, i don't see how you could
have one of these schools without
having a dean  At what point in
time can you effectively manage an
operation without a leader?"

“i think it's an insult to faculty,"
Johnpoll said, "to say that they need
somebody to watch over what they
do educationally. Either we're big
enought to be educators or we‘re not
 I see outrageous decisions of a
high level educational nature made
by administrators against the better
judgement of teachers  it‘s a very
serious problem."

With regard to budget cuts, Joh'n-
poll said, “You know, whenever a
cut is made here, it's made at the ex-
pense of the f acuity. at the expense of
the teaching, it'seven madeatthe ex-
pense of advisement. it‘s never made
at the expense of administration."
However, in agreement with
SUNYA administrators, Johnpoll
