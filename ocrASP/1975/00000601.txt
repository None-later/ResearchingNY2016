_. Ciponera calls a “hardline attitude

on shoplifting."

Although shoplif-
, ting or petit larceny, a

Analin "misdemeanor, is the

most frequently oc-
curring student crime, some students
have been sent to jail on felony
charges. Assistant Director of
Security John Henighan said petit
larcenies are most prevelent among
college crimes.

“We don‘t have anything else even
approaching that (the petit larceny)
problem," he said, , but cited
burglaries along with petit lacenies
as “consistent, on-going things."

Henighan says that illegal entries
of dorm rooms occur mostly when
students are away, but some in-

places blame'on outside authorities,
“ Proper blame ' isn't the ad-
ministrators alone, the blame is the
legislature. Legislators can unders-

tand burcataa’ata, they cannot un- g

derstand educators—they really
have no understanding of the mean-
ing of education."

To that point Hartigan offers a
hypothetical situation. “If the Ex-
ecutive Budget comes out in January
and says. 'reduce or eliminate
twenty-live faculty positions,‘ we
donft have any choice.” Hartigan's
hypothetical situation may not be
too far from reality. He gloomin
predicted, “We can anticipate
serious problemi‘iil‘terms U reduc-
tions coming up and I personally
have the feeling that there are going

to be reductions in faculty ...\From ’

the budget hearing we had down-
town it became crystal clear, at least
to myself, that external authorities
are thinking of the entire system as
having more faculty than we really
need." .

“I think there are several solutions
tothe mess." Johnpoll said, “and this

is what I'm working on." Besides
figuring out administrative and non-
teaching costs, Johnpoll has spent
time searching for answers to
budgetary and faculty cutbacks.
“The one I'm most interested in is for
this University and the whole state to
begin seriously considering adopti ng
the Ontario program." In a letter to a
member of the Board of Regents,
Johnpoll outlined his proposal:

"Basically. it calls/or grants to un-
iversities based on the number of
students attending. These grants are
weighted depending upon the
programs in which students are
enrolled Thus undergraduate liberal
arts students are given a weight of I.
“graduate libé'ral =‘arts students are
given a weight of [.6 and medical
students are given a weight of 4 
There we of course a number alma-
lor savings which could bederemrln-
ed by such a plan. The Central Ad-
ministration of the State University,
whore budget comes to more than
$12,000,000 a year could easily be
eliminated for example. "

Thus far, Johnpoll reports, the
proposal is beingfavorablyreceived.

He has gotten strong response from

the Board of Regents and is tryingto

arrange a meeting with them.
According to Johnpoll, if the

modiﬁed Ontario Plan were adopted '

administrative costs would beforced
to a lower level.- Says Johnpoll,
“Either the administrative costs
would. be cut down or the school
would simply close down because
nobody would go. lf you're paidso
much per student you better have

pretyy good classes. If you‘re going .

to haveclasses of 500students, who's
going to_go’l”
lndependern Urlts
“What I'm really trying to do
here,” Johnpoll said, “is make each
of the universities in the State of New
York essentially an independent
state school." Although John Har-
tigan isn't familiar with the Ontario
Plan he said, “It would be idealistic
but it would be beautiful to be in a
situation where you rule your own
roost. If he has these great ideas,"
Hartiran added, “I wonder if he's
communicated them to people who
can do something about it.“ John-
poll has done exactly that.

Evaluations Questioned as University Requirement

quests to. evaluate some courses, a
very small percentage is due to a
professor being ideologically op-
posed to ACT.

Various reasons include teachers
retiring, classes no longer being
offered, classes with very small
numbers of students and teachers

feeling that a particular class is too
"unusual" to be adequately
evaluated by the ACT survey. Some
teachers will agree to have one class,
evaluated while they feel that it
would not be beneﬁcial for every
class they teach to be surveyed by
ACT.

The platform and other
resolutions were passed with little
discussion. One SASU staff member
who asked not to be identiﬁed said
that all the “constructive legislation"
was written by staff members. “The
delegates were too busy playing
politics to give a damn about getting

anything done,” he said.
Difference Revealed

According to Kirkpatrick, who is
President of both SASU and Stu-

the difference between the two
groups. “TheiSASU resolutions will
form the basis for action,” he said.
“Assembly resolutions can only be
offered to the Trustees in the hope
that they will approve."

Increased Batteries

Recently. accordingto Henighan,
many break-ins have been reported
in Waterbury and Alden Halls on
Alumni Quad. He said these down-
town burglaries probably. aren't
perpetuated by st udents, since many
burglars were unknown to most of
the victims.

Burglary and related incident
losses on campus have decresed con-
siderably, according to University
Police reports:

——In November I974, $14,207 worth
of property was lost or destroyed in
campus crimes. In the same month
this year, $5,804 worth of property
was lost. -

November I974, $81,586 worth of

From January to November l975
property worth $60,702 was lost, 4

prevrous year.

Henighan asserts that it is hardro
attribute the decrease in lost proper.
ty to a specific reason. However he
said, “We've made some changes in
patrol, adding more foot
patrol especially on the quads.“

Aside from burglary, otherscrious
crimes have been committed on cam-
pus this year. Henighun said the
most serious campus crime this year
was a “major drug arrest", whcrcthe
student was convicted of :1 felony
charge. He also said a rape convic-
tion was handed down, in which cttsc
a student was sentenced to ﬁfteen
years in jail, but chighttn added.
“these aren't everyday, Common

SUNYA is being shaped. Presi-

the school's proximity to state
government and supported by
potential strength in those areas.

As Executive Vice President
Phillip Sirotkin told the Senate.
these are the areas that have received
the 28 additional lines for next year
(nine of these at the expense of the
Humanities):

The Division of Social and
Behavioral Sciences (7 additional
faculty lines), the School of Criminal

tinctly new. Even as a I

Justice(l). Education (2), Public Af-
fairs (2), Social war-MI). Mm
(2), and the Division of Science and
Mathematiu (I). ,

This direction appears to be set,
though there are still those with
questions; Josiah Gould
(Philosophy) suggested atthe Senate
meeting that there was no
demonstrable correlation between
public afﬁliation and a university‘s
greatness. In Fields' response he
reiterated the three classical pur-
poses of the university: teaching,
scholarship, and“publie programs.”

But there is noserious worryinthe
university that Fields is onthe wrong
track. The elimination of nine lines
in the Humanities appears to be
honestly related to the lower
workload (faculty/student ratio)
factors and possiblyto Fields‘ image.

“I think he wants to be perceived
as hard-nosed,“ said Bruce Marsh.
president of United University
Professions (UUP), Albany's
chapter of the faculty union.

The union‘s major concern lies
with one of their primary purposes:
job security. Marsh wrote an
editorial in the Albany chapter‘s
newsletter in September that
suggested that the Select Committee
on Academic Priorities‘ report was
misused as a basis for retrenchment.
This issue was brought up at the
Senate meeting when Stephan
Temesvary (Astronomy) asked
Sirotkin about the implications of
firing tenured professors. Sirotkin's
answer was somewhat vague,
possibly because of grievances filed

by the ‘retrenched A'atronotny
department, butlt appeared that

Sirotkin said that ﬁnances alone did

not determine Astronomy's demise.
Thus, Temesvary's question
remains. ‘

Humanities Dean Ruth Schmid
must make the line cuts necessary in
her division. The decisions to cut
there, like the decisions to add
elsewhere, are complicated by the
unknown status of appointments
coming up for renewal this January
and February. Also. Sirotkin
emphasizes that the state budﬂ
crisis could wipe out those
reallocations and present the Presi-
dent with the need for further cuts.

Schmidt will eliminate most of the
nine lines by letting positions that
are becoming unfilled staythat way.
But uptothrce may be actual ﬁrings.

“It may be that English may be
affected." said Schmidt, and sources
in the Human'tim collirm that it

Marsh points out that rapid changes
have caused a morale problem. Stu-

suggested also that the changes were
too fast.
