despite a warning from the stience
department dean tlm he was

took the job. "I outinly wasn‘t go-

“both wasslsoameansofkeeping

Haekerman, in the words of
author Ronnie Dugger. who
describes the situation in his book.
“Our lnvaded Universities,“ went on
to pioneer policia on comulting for
proﬁt that set the pattern at Texas
and other universities around the na-
tion.

As both the economy and
American higher eduution boomed
after the war, college professors
found themselves increasinglyin de-
mand not only to sell their advice
and resarch to private firms, but
also to sit on various corporate
boards of directors, advise govern-
ment panels. testify before con-

gressional committees and even to
start some businesses oftheir own

professors with atomic expertise to
testify again: nuclar dangers.

' “I have asked (leading US
scademidans) to support me objeo
tively and fairly in analyn'ng infor-
mation that l have found andthatl
wantto bring to the attention of the
board," an attorney for an anti-
nuclear grdup told Change
magazine. "Every one of them is
afraid to testify because of
relationships they have with the
Atomic Energy Com-
mission. . .Thereissubtleintimida-
tion; the academicians are bdng
purchased in one way or another
through the funding that is coming
to their schools. . .The industries
are funding efforts and too many
consultants are too afraid totake on
the hand that is feeding them.”

Critiu also attack consulting on
the basis ofits detrimental effeas on
the ﬁnancially strapped university,
where professors may be spending
less time teaching and more time
working with local industry.

“Dre university has in large part
been reduced to sening as banker
and broker for the professor's out-
side interests.“ says James Ridgeway
in his academic critique entitled
“The Gosed Corporation"

In addition. critics question the
idea of “truth seeking" professors
serving on “proﬁt maximizing"
boards of huge corporations. This
practice, says University of Califor-

 

monsoon. 2 f 7

tie physin'u Charles ScthIu.
“raises some most provocative
questions about the ways in which
the academic worldisintegrstedinto
the dominant structure of corporate
America.”

Schwartz, a well-known Berkeley

professor, is currently the country‘s I

luding (and one of the only) oppo
nent of outside consulting by college
professors. Although he admits do-
ing some consulting himself in the
past. Schwartz is so convinced of its
perils that he recently wrote a report
which called for each US university
to require all its employees to make
annual public disclosures of all con-
sulting aaivitien

"Thorough disclosure." he

emphasizes, “so that people can
move to some sort of evaluation to
see who is being served—taxpayers.
students or private industry and
professors."

Otlslde Income

In his report. Schwanz foundthat
68 faculty members and ad-
mirtistrators from 44 universities
hold 85 directorship: on 66 top US
corporations. Schwartz also dis-
covered large numbers of faculty
members serving on many of the
more than I400 committees that ad-
vise state and federal agencies. A
I973 survey showed that 374 persons
from the University of California
belong to such committees with Har-
vard holding 130 memberships and
Columbia. l08.

Moreover. a massive survey
recently completed by Everett C.
[add and Seymour M. Lipset found
that 58% of US engineering faculty
members and 36% of those on educa-

 

tion faculties admitted that con-
sulting was a significant source of
their outside income. According to
Dagger. professor Hackcrman told
him that about one-third of the en-
tire Texas faculty got outside money
for services including lecturefees. At

Harvard, nearly half of the senior ~

faculty members consult, Dugger
says; an MIT ofﬁcial calls his school
a “spawning ground for en-
trepreneurs,” and a professor friend
of Duggers agreed that consulting is
“academic racketeering."
Real World

Critics of Schwartz‘s proposal say
that professors receive their biases
from many sources other than their
consulting contacts and that such
outside work “enriches” the
professor and aids him in understan-
ding how the real world works.

Berkeley business professor
Richard Holton, who serves on the
boards of three corporations. told
“The Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion" that his experience “in the
board room made a better teacher
out of me."

Schwartz, who says consulting
fees may reach $500 per day. con-
tends that investigating professors’
consulting relationships is “looking
into the basic nature of colleges and

Declining SAT Scores Questioned

by The College Press Service

Bafﬂed by a steady decline in
Scholastic Aptitude Test .(SAT)
scores over the past l2'years, the
tests' administrators formed a panel
recently to study reasons for the
decline.

The College Enlruncc lixttnuntt-
tion Board (CEEB). which designs
the test. is guessing that thc rcttsons
might include the types of students
taking the tests. what high schools
are doing or not doing. and societal
changes over the last decade lillll
may have affected scores.

 

They pointed to.' '

mation" to the ﬁrms, often at expen

An $8.4 million darn'ap stilt has

The suit has been lodged against

Women responding to the ads
were told to come to the Sheraton

been clinically dead for up to two
hours.

Doaor Kubler-Rost says that the
amazing thing is that virtually all of
the people who “die” for a short
while and then come back to life
report virtually the same beautiful
experience.

What is death like? According to
Doctor Kubler-Ross. most people
ﬁrst report having a light. pleasant
sensation and then leaving their
bodies; next they are rushed through
a dark tunnel where they hear a buz-
zing sound and then the voices of
people they knew who are now dead.

Fmally. there is an eerie. powerful
vision of an exhilarating light that
scents to encompass the entire un-
iverse. Doctor Kubler-Ross states
that she was at first quite reluctant to
report about the pleasantness of
death fearing that its beauty might
stimulate suicides

STUDY STOPPED

Science magazine reports that an
experiment at the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology into the
possibility of substituting methanol
for gasoline in automobiles was
killed shortly after the Exxon cor-
poration donated $500,000 to MIT.

Theexperimental program hadin-
volved 200 students and faculty
members who operated their cars on
a mixture of gasoline and methanol.
which is wood alcohol. Accordingto
project director Thomas Reed, in-
itial ﬁndings indicated that the addi-
tion of methanol improved gasoline
performance. gave better mileage

and reduced pollution emissions.

However, Reed says. that the

University ofl'tn'als acknowledge
that Exxon was opposed to the ex-

they deny that the Exxon donation
