"To the liter:

Friday night EOPSA ran a talent show in
the ballroom apart of Kwanaa weekend
Having been through the traditional
ceremonies of Kwanaa before. i was surprised

'to find that they had scheduled a concert and

some talent shows to celebrate Kwanu. BOP-
SA is now run by people notinterested in real-
ly expanding black culture at SUNYA to
blacks and whites. Anyway, the talent show
had some of the worst behavior from EOPSA
that l have ever seen. ‘

l was supposed to play in the show. so i
drank some winetorelieve mytensions caused
by a nervous condition 1 have. which has been
documented medically. Waiting for the show
to start, (it was poorly organized and behind
schedule), l developed an attack of my
asthmatic condition. it got worse and the com-
bination of the wine and illness made me black
out backstage while the show was on. Many
people from EOPSA knew of my asthmatic
condition. but none of them came over to help
me out. They said i was drunk. which i might
have been. and they said l was in the way. Ac-
cording to witnesses they tried to move me
with their feet. until friends rescued me.

EOPSA had many football players and
assorted athletes in the ballroom for security.
if i was in the way they could have moved me
easily. since 1 weigh all of lMllbs. “re action
they took only worsened my condition From
their point of view of my being drunk. 1 was
helpless on the floor and not hurting anyone. i
have seen many people on the floors of
different dorms and they received help. l'm
not looking for sympathy. but i can't help
wonder 'what would have happened to me. if i
had been a white student.

When i ﬁnally could leave the ballroom. I
took some medicine and went to sleep in the
Fireside lounge. Certain people from EOPSA
objected to that. but were stopped by my
friends from moving me. They also objected to
my friends trying to get my personal property
out of the ballroom. After feeling better. i
attempted to go backstage to get my property.
and l was forcibly thrown out and reverted to
my condition of illness. After everything was
over, i was shocked to discover my almost-
ncw expensive conga had been badly scratch-

Critical of Council

To the “for:

At last week's Central Council meeting.
several Council representatives were brought
up for impeachment by the Chairman.
However the reasons given for the necessity of
this extreme action were not impeachable
offenses. . . and were, actually, facts which
the Chairman drew from his own biased con-
clusions.

The Student Association Constitution
specifics one. and only one. cause for impeach-
ment . . . having “3 or more unexcused
absences" (Central Council Rules. Part 2, Sec-
tion 4). None of the accused Reps were even
charged with breaking this attendance rule.
instead. the Chairman fabricated his own
grounds for impeachment. utilin'ng a bunch of
ridiculous statistics which purported to show
the “effectiveness” of individual members.
Everyone agreed. and the Chairman admitted.
that this meaningless batch of numbers, which
attempted to show (and rather poorly at that)

only one small aspect of a Council member‘s
job. was irrelevant.

A second reason the Chairman brought up
for the impeachment of one Council Rep was
his not being on a Council Committee. The
fact that the Chairman himself neglected to
appoint this person to a committee—which is
the Chairman's responsibility—was ignored.
Therefore. this Council member wasn't on a
committee because the Chairman hadn‘t ap-
pointed him to one. . .and‘because he wasn't
on a committee. the Chairman moved his im-
peachment. One need not be a Logic major to
see the fallacy of this reasoning.

As one of the Council members who was at-
tacked by the Chairman. lfeel impelled to br-

 a'vfailme to confrora the  7
important is wideh concern the studeﬂs. ,,
Rather-than spend the raster amount of a 1
hour meeting (which dragpd 'on until 2 am.) ‘
on garbage. perhaps Council would bescrv'lng
its constituents better by examining such
thingsasthe deteriorating bus service(discuss-
ed for about 3 minutes last week). the failure to
save the ACT (never diseussed).thesafety and
heating inadequacies at the Wellinpon, and
the suspiciously recurrent “vinsscs” plaguing
Colonial Quad meal-plan contractors.

Unfortunately, last weeks' disorderly
meeting. which saw Council members yelling.
accusing. and personally attacking one
another. was not atypical. in fact. each week.
constructive work and ley'slation is made
almost impossible by the amount of friction
evidenced. One may not wish to believe that r
our highest decision-making branch of stu-
dent government carries on like this. but it
does (ask your Reps. if they weren't impeach-
ed and have not resigned yet).

in fact, another disgusted Rep made a mo-
tion to dissolve Council. and various options
(restructuring Council. replacing the
leadership) were discussed. . . but no action
was taken (of course). lsincerely hopethat the
Council can get itselftogether, and that we can
rationally ﬁgure out a proper course of anion
(be it new Council elections. structural
changes. or new ofﬁcers) so that some measure
of credibility and efﬁcacy can be restored.

With a concerted and determined effort,
concentrating on the issues mentioned. i
believe we can do what Council has failed to
do since September—improve. and contribute
to the university community in a positive, con-
structive manner.

To the Editor:

At the risk of breaking with tradition. this
“letter to the editor" is one of praise rather
than another in the series of complaints. it is
written to acknowledge the outstandingjob of
Mr. Robert Gibson of University College.

During the three and a half years i have
spent at this institution, 1 have never met an in-
dividual more dedicated to the Welfare of
others. i know Mr. Gibson best in his role as

The TRUTH.

d Univerth Cohen. is a member
academic advisor.

 Gibson’s excelled work as a Pro-Law

‘Advis‘oris knowntoeverys'enior Pre-lawstu-

dent ‘on rumpus. Once every semm'ter he par-
ticipates in the Pie-Law societys information
s'asion on LSAT's and LSDAS—a session
which draws more students to a Pro-Law
Sociuy meeting than all other meetings of the
Pee-Law Society combined! From September
until December. Mr. Gibson hosts every
hopeful senior law school applicant and writes
almost every applicant’s Dean's Form (a re-
quirement for law school consideration). At
the interview. the potential law student is
overwhelmed with information necessary for
applying to law schools. statistics showing
which law schools an applicant from SUNYA
with a particular GPA] LSAT combination
has the best chance of acceptance. and helpful
advice on writing law school applications.

in addition to advising seniors on law

school matters. Mr. Gibson is theﬁrst person
every freshman interested in law school meets
at this university. The second day of every
Summer Orientation Session includes a
seminar on the legal ﬁeld. it is at this meeting
that students interested at such an early date in
a legal career are given guidance inﬂuential in
the courses that they will select duringthe next
four years. No particular major is
recommended. however the skills necessary
for a solid foundation are discussed and the
young pro-law student is directed to those
courses that will develop those skills in
him/her individually.

Visiting students from other colleges and
universities have expressed their amazement
to me at the scope of the Pre-Law Advisement
Program here. No other university or college
in the area has such a program. However, no
other university has such a force behind their
programs.

Don't worry juniors. sophomores and
freshmen, Mr. Gibson is not leaving next year;
i am—just taking this opportunity to inform
you about our program and to give credit
where it is long overdue.

A Change at the High Court

With the nomination to the Supreme Court
of Justice John Paul Stevens of the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. Presi-
dent Ford has taken the meritorious road of
avoiding presidential politics in naming a
successor to resigning Associate Justice
William 0. Douglas. in I969 Richard Nixon
nominated, without success. two
Southerners—Clement Hayncsworth and (3.
Harold Carswell——in a rather obvious
political attempt to improve his image in the
South. By nominating u mun of Mr. Stevens‘
recognized stature, however. President Ford
hus put this type of controversy aside and has
placed legal andjudicittl eminence ﬁrst. As At-
torney General Edward Levi said, the
President‘s choice “was it commitment to ex-
ccllcnce." An important gesture from it man
who so upset the legal order in 1974 by pur-
doning Richard Nixon.

11 was only reluctantly. though. that Mr.
Justice Douglas finally left. creating this
Vacancy which Mr. Stevens will now un-
doubtedly fill. Mr. Douglas continually
rcasserted that, in spite ofu stroke cxpcricnccd
last December 31. he would not resign from
the Court. The thing which ﬁnally distracted
him from his work. ultimately causing him to
quit. was the great pain and physical anguish
he was experiencing from his stroke: “During
the hours of oral argument last week
(November 3) pain mudcit necessary for mcto
leave the bench several limes. l have had to
leave several times this week (November l0)
also. I shall continue to seek relief from this
unabated pain but there is no bright prospect
In View."

As opposed to those who have continually
lamented about the Court‘s mounting work
load. such as Justice Burger. Justice Douglas.
in spite of his illness. never found any
problems with the Court's responsibilities.
While the caseload piled up. he said that he
could easily do tliejob in four days it week. As
recently as last June 23. after he had been ill)-
scnt from the Court because of his illness. he

 

by David Troege -
reiterated his view that the existing load could
easily be carried.

At that time Justice Douglas gave a
profound analysis of the dilemma the Court
now finds itself in regarding its duties: “with
all respect. the state court judges and lower
Federal court judges are quite conservative.
Hence. letting their decision stand is to keep
alive at conscrvulivc ruling supportive of the
status quo.“

“Than means that mounting plans of in-
dividuals art: not heard. and that the Court
will no longer take on highly controversial
issues. 'l‘ht- establishment and its cotcric of
news commcnlulors will applaud as the law
will have been shaped by the philosophy of
judges who share their view." He sees the
Court in the necessary position of bcingubovc
politics and governmental influence. givingin-
dividual rights as equal tr hearing as that
ttllowcd for the rights of authority.

Perhaps just as important as his judicial
stands on individual rights over the yours are
what Douglas stands for as an individual. He
is living proofthtit ugcisjust a number. merely
:1 state of mind. A man of 77, though experien-
cing physical limitations. can be as young as
the 17 your old as long us he is willing to re—
main open to new experiences. ncvcr shutting
his mind. As an ardent outdoorsmun who has
been murricd four timcs(his present. whom he
married in 1966. is now 32). he should be iin in-
spirution to all for continuing enthusiasm for
living. Until his stroke. hiking and climbing
rcmuincd his pride and pleasure.

Justice Stevens loo. in his own way.
transmits u certain boyish exuberance. That
persistent flap of hair which continually falls
on his forehead seems to sit on the head of a
man who has never lost his youthfulncss. His
judicial stands will be different from those of
Justice Douglas. undoubtedly a strong con-
trast to Douglas‘ fervent liberalism. The
Supreme Court will be gettingu well respected
man. a moderate who is recognired by all for
his intelligence and scholarly insight.

‘ IGetting Into. Business

 

itriOl/C0mf.

 

SUNYA's School of Business has decided‘that all potential business majors mtﬁ'
apply separately for admission to their school, and will insist on; minimum grade‘
point average for the applicants. '

The change from virtual open enrollment. according to Dean William Holstein. isin

response to an enormous increase in "enrollment over the past few years.
. The school investigated other alternatives to the admission action. and presumably
increasing the size of the school itself was considered. They received two additional
lines for next year in the reallocations decisions recently made by President ‘Fields and
Vice, Ptcsident Sirotkin, but two lines doesn't even bring the faculty up to a level
commensurate with student growth. The school will remain hard-pressed.

Clearly there is great student interest in business. and it is doubtful that it is simply a
temporary trend. The ecpnomy starves for good managers, accountants and economic
advisers. With that in mind, it seems strange that the response is to cut enrollment
rather than enlarge the school to fulfill the need. But with the budget crisis facingthe '
state and thus the university. limitingenrollment is a logical though unfortunate wayto
ease the school’s present burden.

The Business school is certainly not wringing itshandkerchief about the situation.

The admissions requirements will add prestige, something this university needs.
President Fields told the University Senate last week that SUNYA is not yet known‘ﬁn
the hinterlands.” as if there was something inherantly wrong in it. ironically, that‘
prestige is derived from the students who will be refused entrance because they failed to
meet the standards the school will set.
I Assuming that limiting enrollment is the only answer tothe workload problems. it is
Important that the Business school not penalize SUNYA‘s current freshman and
sophomores who expected that there would be no restrictions on business enrollment.
These students must be granted open admission, even if it means delaying the
Implementation of the requirements or not accepting transfers.

Getting In Deeply

As the pressures and anxieties of this time in the semester begin to interfere with
every part of student life. it is especially important to be aware of the perspective in
which exams and ﬁnal papers have a place.

The healthiest attitude will make grades important only if they have a part in a
highly-valued future. Even this is no hard and fast rule. since what a student wants as
her/her future may not be what is best. The key life goals of succss, happiness or
comfort are not attained just because one is in a particular profession.

Grades that are important because of needs one has for self-esteem or parental
approval should not be pursued. Self—esteem come from having learned something and
good grades then come naturally. Still, if the grades are mediocre it is still quite possible
that valuable learning has gone on. learning that might end up more useful than that
which would have resulted in higher grades.

There is no reason for panic these two Weeks. and anxiety will only make things more
difficult. Studying hard can be beneﬁcial, but don’t let it warp your brain.

Buses: A Reminder

it‘s all well and good that the university has found funds through the elimination of
Astronomy and the Allen Center and reallocations to add new faculty lines. But one
question arises as the result of all this new found wealth:

What good are the teachers if the students can't get uptown to class?
