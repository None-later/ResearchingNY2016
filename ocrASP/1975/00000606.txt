SUNYA Spats liars-mien

The 1975-76 State University of
New.‘ York Athletic Conference
(SUNYAC) basketball race has
slresdystartedwithseveralteamsset
to give defending champion
kookpost a run at the title. The
eventual championwillearnaberth
in the NCAA Division III East
Redonal Tournament in March.

‘ kockport won the rep'onal in 1975
and went on to finish. fourth
' nationally in Division Ill. _

Gone from coach Mauro Pan-
aggio's 23-5 squad that was lo-l in
conference play are All-Conference
forward Pops McTaw and center
Kevin Williams, lost for personal
reuons. Key returnees are Pan-
aggio's brother Dan, also an All-
SUNYAC choice a year ago, 6-4
forward-center Dale O'DeIl, and 6-5
center Steve Simmons. Although
Mauro Panaggio terms 1975-76 a
rebuilding year, he retains enough
talent, plus the addition of several
newcomers, to rate a contender‘s
role in the pennant race.

Chief threats to the Golden
Eagles' repeating as champs ﬁgure to
be Oneonta and Albany. withseveral
other teams ﬁlling “dark horse"
slots. Oneonta, 8-3 and tied forthird
last year, returns nine lettermen, in-
cluding All-SUNYAC Steve
Blackmon, 6-5 center Steve Wolcott,
and piaymaking guard Kevin
Croutier, Coach Don Flewelling’s
Red Dragons will miss All-
Conference Jackie Dalton and Jim
Coon, both LOGO-point career men.

Albany suffered an unexpected
loss when its leading scorer and All-
Conference representative Ed J ohn-
son failed to return to school:
However, Dick Sauers has three
starters returning — guards Mike
Suprunowicz and Gary 'I'revett, and
forward Bob Audi — from his 9-2
SUNYAC club that handed
Bl'ockport its only league defeat.
Replacing Johnson and ﬁnding a
center are the Great Danes‘ major
tasks.

Fredonia ﬁnished 7-4 in fifth place
a year ago and coach Bill Hughes has
four starters returning: 6-4 forward
Herb Joyner. the leading scorer on
the defense-minded Blue Devils; 6-4
forward Pete Kawiak, 6-3 Jim Hoop-
ﬁnger. and 6-7 center Jon Quinn.
Some may lose their ﬁrst string roles,
however, in the face of challenges
from several transfers. Hughes,
whose team led Division III in team
defense last year (51.4), feelstheclub
lacks speed and size.

Geneseo will sorely miss
SUN YAC Most Valuable Player Ed
Robots, the Blue Knights' leading
scorer and reboundcr, and three
other starters from its 6-5, sixthplace
team of last winter. Coach Tom
Pope had an “excellent recruiting
year” and hopes the newcomers

State Hockey Club Gees Amateur

by Mike Pieka 1

A hockey team on this campus?
That's right. lt'sthe Albany State Ice
Hockey Club.

The name may be misleading(they
are not recognized on this campus as
having achieved “club” status) but
the game is real. In only its second
year of operation, the team has at-
tained amateur standing inthe Troy
Amateur Hockey Association.

Of the twenty players on the
squad. “more than half are
students," says the team‘s coach,
Donald Nemcik, who is also a stu-
dent here. And the rest? “They're
from the Metroland area."

Pretty Good Players

According to Nemcik, he coaches
“some pretty good players," but they
had "no way to express their talent"
before the team was organized. This
club he feels, gives them an excellent
opportunity to dojust that.

“They started last year," he con-
tinued. "and played a few games at
Frear Park (in Troy), but they didn't
have a coach. “I'm an avid hockey

fan, I came to the games! liked it,
and I got involved." Involved
enough to be voted coach.

The A.S.I.H.C. is self-funded
which means the' players pay their
own way—for everything. From
their own hockey sticks and helmets
to the renting of a hockey rink for
their games.

There are no coaching assistants,
so Nemcik relies on team captain
Torn Burns and assistant captains
Jeff Perlowitz and Bill Stech for ad-
vice. All are students and played last
year. (Burns and Perlowitz are
centers, Stech is a right wing, and

Nemcik doesn't play—he has trouble -

skating.)

Last year. with the club playingin-
formally, it was difﬁcult to obtain
rinks before midnight for many of
the games. “But this year. we have
some decent times." says Nemcik. 0f
the 21 games on the schedule, nine
begin at 7 pm. and six begin at 5:50
pm. None start after nine o'clock.

Since the league is amateur, there
is no age limit for the players. "Most
[of the players] have jobs, families,"
says the coach. “and they've been
playing since they were young—but
they just don‘t want to give it up.“

Playing Disadvantage
So if you‘re a student, you’re play-
ing ata disadvantage. According to
Nemcik, there are plenty of
“established” veterans in the league.
And “the schedule is tough. The
Troy Belters, Louies and Rensselaer

Flyers, for example are all rough,"
he said.
A Hesﬂbreaker

But the Albany Staters may fare
better than most would care to guess.
in their very-ﬁrst amateur match,
they lost a heartbreaker to the Troy
Reunion Club, 4-3. Trailing 4-0
midway through the third and final
period, Albany tallied three times in
a row in the space of three minutes.
Nat Heintz scored ﬁrst at I I:59 on a
fine pass from Perlowitz,
defenseman Billy Davenport tallied
an unassisted goal a little over a
minute later, and Perlowitz himself
scored at l5:02 assisted by Jim
Miller.

Nemcik yanked goalie Jim John-
son in the waning moments and
mixed-up the lines considerably in
the hopes of getting the equalizer,
but all to no avail. Albany actually
outshot Troy by a 42-39 margin
which seemed to give the coach
reason to beexcited over his squad's
chances. “The team played like a
unit, too," he exclaimed.

Nemcik is still “trying to drum up
funsupport" amongthestudentsand
invites anyone to come either to the
practice sessions, held at the Union
College Field House, or the regularly
scheduled games. played at Frear
Park. Yes, there is a hockey team on
the Albany campus . . .

Graham Hill Dies
In Airplane Crash

by Eric Goldstein

Internationally renowned For-
mula I driver Graham Hill died this
past Sunday in a small airplane
crash. Hill was 417 years of age.

The uniqueness of Formula racing
breeds many diverse personalities
among its drivers. Spectators the

world over admire these men en
mass for their obi/it y and courage.
The honor most valued by the
drivers is the high regard gi ven to but
a few amongst themselves.

Graham Hill was a man par-
ticularly deserving of the respect of-

forded him by those most intimate] y
involved in Formula racing; respect
not only for his outstanding driving
skill and leVeI of dedication, but for
his compassion and scnsltlvlty as
well.

It is this universal and mulli-
dimensional regard for Hill which
slnglcd him out as on exceptional
human being, one whose loss is, and
will continue to be, deeply/ell.
