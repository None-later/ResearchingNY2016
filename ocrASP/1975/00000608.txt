he little green buttons

wink and gleam on the

wide lapels of the Secret
Service men under the blue
fluorescent lights. The men are
restless. they have heard this
speech too many times already
and will be hearing it for another
year and possibly (hope springs
eternal) another five; they lounge
against the wall. chew gum. adjust
their wide ties. stare insolently at
the few women in the room. shove
hands in the, pockets of their
trenchcoats.

Behind the lectern, Jimmy
Carter. the man on the buttons who
is running for President for the
second time. is speaking. He looks
very different in person from the
Kennedy-as-farmer type sharply
etched in black and white on the
little pins—more scholarly. with
the shock of whitening hair almost
paternal—but one looks at the
florid coloring. the meatiness of
the lips and j owls. and cannot help
thinking of the Southern
demagogue of history and
fiction—Huey Long. Willie Stark,
George Wallace.

The voice does not change the
impression. when he introduces
himself as "fawmuh guvuhnuh of

out with a caress. He himself is
quick to notice this impression; in
response to a particularly hostile
question from a member of the
audience. he answers, "The name
is Jimmy Carter. not George

 

 

Wallace." Big laugh from the
audience. with a nervous edge—
how did he know we were thinking
that?

He is speaking softly now. but

with authority; when he had begun ‘

some fifteen minutes ago he had
been too loud. and somewhat
monotonously so in a peculiarly
Southern way:
themselves rose and fell in tone
but the cadence of the phrases did

not. His listeners. unused to the.

rhythm of this speech and more
accustomed to New York nasality.
became restless and uneasy.
folded their arms. shifted in their
chairs.

But they are interested now: he
is fielding questions. answering
the standard ones—New York
City. the Middle East—quickly,
obviously prepared; waffling
badly on others. The questions
come fast; as soon as he pauses
audibly. fifteen more hands go up.

The confusion is
understandable; during the
remarks Carter had made before
he asked for questions. he had
talked little and said less—very
little more. in fact. than to speak
briefly of his background,
experience. and his absolute
assurance that he would be
President, ,, h ‘A _
 In’ the .courBel fifths {evening he
mentions this last confidence
several times. and each time the
audience laughs. Who. they
wonder. does he think he is? Most
know him as no more than one of

candidates. Many are here out of
simple curiosity; a sizable number
wear “I‘m for Fred Harris" buttons
and are apparently checking out
the competition. No one believes
that this man. who would look
more at home in overalls than in
his well-cut blue suit. and whose
backing seems. despite his
affirmations. notably limited. can
.possibly win an election or even a
primary in a. field already
overcrowded with overqualified
candidates.

He does well with the questions.

ap. Freak Brothers. Slow
Z Death: these are the names
of some of the un-
derground comic books that are
helping SUNYA senior Tom Keefe
work his way through college.

“I needed the money to get
myself through college." said
Keefe. “Since I had access to a
comic book distributor. I decided
to try selling them in the Campus
Center."

Keefe also sells cigarette
papers. pipes and afrocombs on
Thursdays at a table in the
Campus Center. He finds. though.
that the comics sell better than

 

these “head products" which he
gets from Lyricon. a company in
his hometown of Saugerties. New
York. The comics also come from
Saugerties. from a distributor
known as Jack Paul. a. personal
friend of Keefe's.

To sell these items in the
Campus Center. Keefe was
required to apply for a permit

i swim.“ r A am

from SA.

“The permit lasts for two
months," Keefe explained. “OnceI
had it I had to sign up in the Office
of the Campus Center for atable. I
started this last year when I first
came to Albany. Due to some
hassle when the Soliciatation
Committee [of SA] tried to do away
with the selling tables. we people
who were selling in the CC got
together in a craft guild. Since
then we haven’t had any problem."

Keefe says his best selling
comics are the Zap and Freak
Brothers series. “People know
about them." he explained.

He suggests for newcomers that
they try the R. Crumb comics. “He
was the first in the undergrounds
and is usually good. His Zap #4 is
famous. It was declared
pornographic and illegal in a
court case a few years ago because
of a story about incest."

For feminists there are comics
written by women such as
Pandora's Box and Girl Fight
Funnies. There are even comics
with a serious sex education
orientation such as Facts of Life
Funnies and Abortion Eve.

"One person bought some sex-ed
comics from me to use in her
Sunday school class." said Keefe.

“These comics appeal to a cross
section of the American public.
not just any specific groups."

Underground comics diffar from
mainstream comic books in that
they are not covered by the Comic
Book Code Seal of Approval. This
code was developed in the 1950's as
an instrument of self-government
amoung comic book distributors.
Those adhering to the code are not
allowed to portray blood orthemes
involving sex or drugs.
Underground comics deal with
any theme imaginable. come out
irregularly and have little or no
advertising. Their price range is
generally from 35 cents to $1.25.

“I make about 40% of the face
value of the comic book." said
Keefe. “I consider it a worthwhile
selling day if I make $30 gross
sales. I seriously put myself
through school this way. If the
school didn't provide this
opportunity for me to work. I
wouldn‘t be able to be in college
now."

Asked about his future plans.
this 23 year-old history/political
science major facetiously replied:

“I plan to set up a chain in
colleges throughout the country
and become the Howard Johnson
of the underground oomioworld."

overly influence his statements.
And then suddenly the local
political functionary who had
introduced him ("Ladies and
gentlemen, the next President of

the United States. Mr. Jimmy
Carterl") is at his elbow. and he is
winding up with well-rehearsed
.and carefully chosen words.

The audience. which has slowly
trickled,in_,until now. becomes a
standing crowd: surrounding

.three walls of the room.

encroaching on the fourth. and
completely blocking the doorway.
It applaudes with no small
warmth and puts on coats as the
functionary reminds it that
volunteer cards and contributions
may be left on the table just
outside the door.

As the Secret Service men
tighten the belts of their raincoats
(the slight bulge under the left
armpit becoming more apparent)
and surround Jimmy Carter in a
forest of little green pins
preparatory to the obligatory
flesh-pressing crusade through
the crowd. I think that although I
would certainly never buy a used
car from this man. I might very
possibly buy a tractor from him.
He seems to know more about
tractors.

I find him likable. which may
become more of a liability than an
asset in a year when a man of
decisive action should become the
opponent of an incumbent who is.
sadly. very little more than
likable. Carter’s ideas are at this
point extremely nonspecific. to
say the least. and one can only
hope that several grueling months
of campaigning will serve to
clarify them; if he does not de-fuzz
his thinking he will either be
quickly forgotten or elected.

I should save my green button
for some future collector of
memorabilia, I think, as I walk out
into the cold where an entourage of

cars is waiting. motors humming.
for a man who is running very "

hard for the Presidency of the
United States. I hope his Secret
'Service men do not become too
bored in the months ahead.
