awakes from 'a restless sleep and
gains newfound courage as he
views the crystalline sky out a
small basement window. He
recalls the year and a half of
heartache. fear. longing. scouting,
nocturnal traveling and intense
planning leading up to this day;

are the first revolutionaries to be
successful in thwarting the
authorities’ attempts to locate and
destroy their organization.

Twenty-three years earlier a
small group of fanatical right
wing fascists gained solid
victories in the regional elections
across the Peoples Republic of
North American States. This
enabled the fascists to gain control
of the major sections of the
military. The Peoples Republic
hadl laced t ni d States‘of
Amleﬁgii aftert‘l ’gsolﬁaiigi'ﬁii’t‘y
gained solid majorities in the old
Congress. When a socialist
president was elected in 2021 he
and the Congress undertook a

drastic plan in which the nation
was to be completely transformed
politically..This new government
declared a new nation and it was to
be recognized as The People's
Republic of North American
States.

In 2064 a military-backed fascist
coup succeeded in overthrowing
the socialist government and
established the UAP. The
government invaded Canada and
Mexico with little resistance. and
these nations came under the rule
of the UAP. During the first year
there were massive protests
against the fascist regime. and the
military retaliated brutally and
mercilessly. Over one million
people were killed and millions of
others wounded. The populace
saw the futility of the public

protests and the revolt went
underground. Each underground
organization that was discovered
was wiped out and none who were
captured lived to tell about it.

.. Realizing that the military
deterrent was not effective enough
in keeping the people in line. the
regime undertook a massive. but
clandestine, research program.
.The ultimate goal of the research
was to develop a drug with
properties agreed upon by the
regime. The chemists doing the
research were kept prisoner in
undergroundlaboratories, and the

one of the chemists committed
suicide, and the others involved in
the research were put to death a
short time later. The final goal set
by the regime and reached by the
chemists was that prolonged
withdrawal was to be fatal in all
cases following addiction to
Corbamorphone.

families of these men were held as
hostages to assure compliance
with their exorbitant requests.
After eleven months three of the
chemists synthesized what the
beliei‘vé‘d to be the most powerful
opiate derived drug in the history
of the world. The drug. called
Corbamorphone. was unique in
that it was soluble in water and it
was colorless and tasteless.
Unlike other opi ate-derived drugs.
Corbamorphone was able to pass
through the membranes of the
gastro-intestina] tract. Once
dissolved it was nearly
impossible to separate it again
from the solution except under the
most ideal laboratory conditions.
In small quantities there was no
appreciable effect on the body
although the dosage was enough
to produce addiction. Ninety-eight
percent of the subjects felt no
change when such a dosage was
administered.
Coerced by the government. the
chemists built upon the basic
formula of the drug until the final
goal was reached. The chemists
reached this goal in a short time

learned by the public because all
who happened upon the
operations were shot
immediately. The members of the
government and the military used
their own water supplies and these
were left free of Corbamorphone.
After all the major water supplies
had sufficient quantities of the
drug to produce addiction the
regime of the UAP waited for the
day that they would release news
of the drug to the public.

This day came exactly two
months after the first ounce of
Corbamorphone was added to the
reservoirs. No one but the most
pessimistic believed the
statements concerning the drug.
Most felt it was a propaganda
story or some horrible joke. To
prove what they were saying. the
regime closed off all the pipelines
from the treated reservoirs
leading to the major megalopolis
areas. The populace was forced to
obtain their water in bottles
supplied ' by the government.
These bottles contained water free
of Corbamorphone. The
government warned that there
would be widespread withdrawal
and death. but still the people
requed to believe the stories.

In a week’s time all the hospitals
in the cities and megalopolitan
areas were completely
overwhelmed by thousands of
people complaining of nausea and
extreme physical discomfort.
Many thought that the regime had
added nausea inducing drugs to
their bottled water. and most
refused to believe the

government's warnings. In
another four days time reports of
deaths started filtering out of the
hospitals. People were dying of
massive coronary attacks
combined With violent
convulsions. Mass hysteria broke
out when people began dying in
the streets. The people pleaded
with the regime to allow them to
drink the Corbamorphone water
again. The regime had reached its
objective. An entire nation was
addicted to a drug in which
prolonged withdrawal was
irrevocably fatal and only the
members of the regime had the
power to administer the drug.
From this time on the regime
had notrouble keeping order in the
country. Whenever there was a
behavior trouble in any province
the military or the local
Provincial Police (PP) had only to
step in and start rationing the
bottled water. Panic set in when
thousands went into withdrawal
and the local problem of undesired
behavior soon disappeared. The
only alternative to drinking the
drugged water was to collect rain
water. desalinated seawater. or
find untreated springs. The brave

young man was Justin Miles. a
name later cheered by the people
and cursed by the Provincial
Police. While continuing to work
by day for the province. Justin
spent long hours at night tryingto
contact and organize others who
felt as opposed to the regime as he
eas. and who were not afraid to
risk their lives for the good of the
people.

After about six months.
underground communications
were set up and Miles was in
contact with nearly two hundred
fellow revolutionaries. The group
named themselves the People's
Strike Force for Retribution, orthe
PSFR. In the firstfew months of its
existence the PSFR managed to
sabotage a number of military
buildings. They also managed to
ambush a truck and two armored
cars carrying weapons and
ammunition to a nearby depot.
Only three of the seventy men who
took part in the ambush were
captured and they died from
torture before giving one word of
information to the PP.

Justin Miles now found himself
with a cache of arms and
ammunition large enough to outfit
the entire PSFR. Although they

entirely free. They. as well as all
common citizens of the UAP. were
still addicted to Corbamorphone.
They still had to depend on the
regime for the life-sustaining
water. while all the members of the
government and the military were
free from addiction. This
motivated them to steal a large
quantity of Corbamorphone and
store it for use in their final plan.

The PSFR slowed its activity to
a virtual standstill for six months
while they planned a major armed
attack against the provincial
miltary ammunitions depot. This
attack was going to be a
diversionary ploy which
hopefully would draw
reinforcements from the joint
government and military
reservoir three miles away. A

handful of men would try to sneak
past- the weakened guard at the
reservoir and place the stolen
Corbamorphone into the water
supply. while the main body of the
PSFR would be attacking the
ammunitions depot. If all
proceeded as planned. the men
would sneak back to the main
force attacking the depot. No one
in the provincial government or
the military would know of the
Corbamorphone in theirwater and
they too would become addicted.
The people would have won an
important spiritual victory and

fired in the distance reach them.
The military garrison at the depot
has been caught completely by
surprise and they are suffering
heavy losses. Within twenty
minutes all of the garrison at the
reservoir except a small handful
of soldiers have left in trucks to
aid the beleaguered depot. Miles
and his comrades sneak to the far
side of the reservoir. scale thewall
surrounding it and deposit the
Corbamorphone without incident.
They are able to sneak back to the
depot without being seen by the

the attack and they are contentto wait. The countryls

In a few days' time. due to the unkown addiction of the
garrison, widespread withdrawal occurs.

 

this could be the needed spark to
ignite a mass revolution against

provinces. It was widely known

present easement and many felt
they only neededa slightincentive
to revolt against their superiors.

Justin Miles reflects on all that
has occurred priorto this day as he
gazes out his window. He can't
help asking himself whether he
has miscalculated any variable in
the planned attack. He thinks of
the men of the PSFR and he
wonders whether he was wrong to
convince them to face almost
certain death for a cause that he
initiated. Realizing that there is no
turning back he curses himself for
doubting the righteousness of
their actions. He still cannot fully
suppress the lingering sorrow he
feels for his courageous followers.

All during the day members of
the PSFR filter into the basement
of Miles, unnoticed by the secure
and unknowing Provincial Police.
The men receive their final
instructions and leave to prepare
for the rendezvous in the woods
outside the depot. The last member
of the main attack forceleaves and
Justin makes his preparations for
the reservoir. He and five of his
best men will sneak to the water's
edge and deposit the
Corbamorphone at the appointed
time.

When Justin and his comrades
reach the reservoirthey are struck
by how unaware the garrison is of
the impending events. As Justin
looks at each of his comrades he
wonders whether they will live
through the day and if they die
whether their loved ones will
understand the reasons for their
death. Justin's thoughts are

soldiers on the roads.

The main group of the PSFR has
been pinned down by the
reinforcements from the reservoir

driving the soldiers back. By this
time. unknown to the PSFR. a
fifteen hundred man detachment
from an army base twenty miles
away has reached a position a
quarter mile from the depot. They
nearly surround the PSFR and the
revolutionaries are forced to
retreat into the woods where a
detachment of the Provincial
Police now lie in waiting. The
PSFR is trapped. but they refuse to
surrender having vowed to fight
until death. In a short time every
last man of the PSFR is dead.
although they inflict heavy losses
on the PP and the military. Among
the last to die is Miles. who cries
out in his last breath. “We have not
died in vain! Be warned. the people
will triumph!"
News of the attack spreads

quickly across the nati'omr'l‘he
military claims it is a great
victory for the regime over a
group of “mad pirates." but the
populace is not fooled Ind they
consider the men heroes. .Only a
small number of people know the
real purpose of the attack andthey
are content to wait. The country is
in a state of extreme tension and
tempers are short. Two weeks

. after the attack the garrison at the

reservoir travels to a neighboring
province for a series of war games.
Once there they drink the local
provincial military water which is
free of Corbamorphone. In a few
days' time. due to the unknown
addiction of the garrison.
widespread withdrawal occurs. It
takes two days for the provincial
government to realize what has
happened. but by this time many of
the soldiers have died. Rumors
that the military leaders
deliberately placed the drug in the
water supply spread through all
branches of the military.
Everywhere disenchanted units of
the military are finally given
sufficient motivation to rebel
against that oppressive tactics of
their superiors. A widespread
civil war breaks out between units
loyal to the regime and those who
want [a less‘ restrictive
segmentiedét "a math of
fighting. and heavy losses. the
fasCist regime is’overthrown and a
new military government gains
control of the Union of American
Provinces.

The new government starts its
rule by removing almost all the
oppresive laws of the old regime.
The most important of these being
the end to the rationing of the
Corbamorphone-treated water.
Everywhere the people rejoice.
and feel a joy that they have not
felt since before the fascists
gained control over twenty years
earlier. Justin Miles and his
People's Strike Force for
Retribution are heralded as
national heroes. and a memorial
shrine is built in their honor. Miles
and the PSFR had not died in vain.
The era of a military-backed
government using a deadly drug
for the purposes of oppression
was over.
