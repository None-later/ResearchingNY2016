Feature: ‘

Day

b Gavin Murphy
he professor‘s voice
drones out over the class of

plastic andenamel desks
wherein sit the attending yet
unattentive students. His words
dissipatethroughoutthe classlike
opiated sound particles. The
resulting reveries reveals a
stagnated stream of collective
conciousness.

Some are writing letters to their
lovers. Others are fantasizing
about lovers and sex. finding love
and sex. sex and loving. and alittle
more sex. Most are staring
blankly. like a presence in a
daydream.

. . . the streetcorner in front of
the stationary store is blemished
with a multitude of chewing gum
splotches. The sun is setting andI
hope the evening paper is
available. A Virginia slim woman
with a poodle emerges from the
sotre as I approach. A young boy
sitting on the curb drinking cola
surmises us. myself and the two
bitches at opposite ends of aleash.

As our paths cross an obscene
cardboard woman with incredible
pearly whites and amazon legs is
aiming a kodak at us from inside
the storefront window. I smile. and
the moment becomes a cosmic
photograph.

Inside I assemble the right coins
and purchase the days newpaper:
Page i: Politicians in pinstripe.
posing on the lawn -
glamorous and grotesque.

Page 12: The Sahara is moving.

the sphinx of death has come.

starving in solidarity

where will they run?

Blonde hair ﬂashes as long
slender fingers tuck it behind the
ear so asto enable my classmate to
see her notes. 80 as to interrupt my
reverie. ,The Prof lights another
cigarette. Inspired by slung full of
smoke he begins to outline our
next topic.

I switch position restlessly in a
vain attempt to mold my buttocks
into the hard plastic enamel
substance thing called a desk. I
enter into a further regression.

. .waiting to the last minute
beside the doorway to mediocrityl
observe everyone hurrying so as
not to be late. The cast of
characters includes Mrs. G. the
grey haired bird lady and assorted
super achiever intellectual
asskissers.

Once inside I await the arrival of

A.W.
From the beak of the bird lady:
“When showing possession in the
plural one must place what
where?"

As hands raise I am watching-

for the doorknob to turn. A.W. is
late. yet I know he will arrive.
Schedules are meaningless in his
universe. He is unconcerned with
plural possession. He is very
basic. He exists like a steaming
equatorial jungle. colorful and
exotic. He will enter as if
sprouting through a seam in
concrete. The knob turns and the
large wooden door slowly opens.
Motion is suspended as the bird
lady scrutinizes the tardy one. All
heads turn to dig the entrance.
A.W. is incapable of a discrete
entry. He shuffles in slowly.
permitting the brilliance of his
plummage to dazzle. Ignoring the
old hen in the front of the class. his
gaze rests on a younger specimen
who coyly averts her glance. She
is aware of his predatory nature
and intimidated by the fierceness
of his talons.

Psychic Communication

He takes the seat in front of me.
acknowledging my presence with
a grin. His eyes are glistening
cry stale. He is especially
talkative today. Sitting on the
outer limits. ignored by the rest of
the class. he is talking and I am
listening. Stoned psychic

communication.

“I ' could say I would've or
should've but that's too heavy into
the lower subjunctive depths." We
stare out the window. The sun is
shining on suburpia causing the
leaves to shimmer like schools of
fish swimming through a sea of
sky-blue. , Through the metal
framed glass windows. it is an
aquarium of clouds andtreee. with
little feathered beasts that move
rapidly about. There are also
humans in shorts and sneakers
running in a big circle.

We are enjoying ourselves
immensely. so much so that we are
laughing very loudly. almost
hysterically. We perceive the
multitude of stares aimed in our
direction from within the nucleus.
They do not appreciate that we are
in marineland. The stares
suddenly metamorphasize into a
different set of characters with
different faces. They are staring
uneasily at the inane grin on my
face as l chuckle to myself. I
realize A.W. is gone. I realize
reality once again.

The chimes sound the end of
class. Weather? Hurry. I cap my
pen. Reality? I assemble my
books. Dreams. Blonde. Today's
reality becomes tomorrow's
dreams. Exit.
