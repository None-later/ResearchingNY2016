:Brief Excursion
to a World of The Ill

' by lush Palley
ittle wheels vibrate from
I side to side. skipping over
the uneven parts of the
tiles. The squeaking noise
disturbs me. and I open my eyes a
little. I’m trying to see who they
want this time.

The orderly stops the
wheelchair when he gets to the
middle of the room and glances at
the names above the beds. He
reads the other three first. then
mine. “Mr. Palley?” An
embarrased smile on his face. he
suddenly realizes that we are
about the same age. He is used to
rooms full of middle age men with
bad backs and heart trouble, and is
surprised to see a twenty year old
in their midst.

“M, 5‘ galley? I n d slowl and

“You're scheduled for, radiation
scanning."

I grimace. Another test. I'm not
paranoid. but I'm beginning to
thinkthat they are plotting to stick
my veins and arteries until they
collapse. until all that's left is
holes. No flesh. just holes. And
more holes than Albert Hall.
probably.

It makes me jealous of Max
Cohen. the patient diagonally
across the room. because they
never bother him for tests of any
kind. He has a pinched nerve in his
back and just lies there. staring
dreamily up at the TV.
occasionally changing channels.
Probably enough Valium ﬂoating
through him to sedate a medium-
size school of blue whales.

They give me Valium too. butI
don't take it anymore. It makes me
sleep all day. and I'd rather hide
the tablets in my suitcase and stay
awake. reading—or talking to
friends on the telephone. saying
things that turn the heads of the
other patients in the room. They
are intensely interested in my

mostly.

For a while I thought I was very
sick. I had some phlebitis a few
months before and now I had chest
pains. which led everyone to
believe I had blood clots in my
lungs. That's why I am the victim
of so many tests.

This time they are going to shoot
a radioactive isotope into my
bloodstream. seeing if parts of the
lungs show up dark on the
scanning machine. (Healthy lungs
appear white on the scanner.)

“It's very simple and very
effective." the doctor explains as
he ties my arm off. slapping and
rolling the bulging veins under
his fingertips until he finds one

trouble. ‘ * _ ~

The doctor told himhe will only
live for about half a year unless he
gets a pacemaker put in his chest.
The doctor told him he has to stop
smoking. Harry would rather die.
If the nurses or medical personnel
find the cigarettes. they note it on
Harry’s chart. and his doctor will
give him another lecture.

So Harry hides the cigarettes
because he likes the nurses and
doesn't like to see them upset. The
nurses like Harry also. He says
nice things to them about their
figures. makes them smile telling
them. “If 'I was a kid again I’d ask'
you out right now. really."

The nurses that like Harry the
most are the electrocardiagram
operators. They come by once or
twice a day to take readings for
Harry‘s chart. To do this. they
have to place five little suction
cups on his body. which are wired
to the machine. The reason they
like Harry so much is that his
plump. hairless. pale white body
is a perfect receptacle for their
little suction cups. On they go. off
they 'go, leaving little pink rings
on his chest. like the rings the
glasses leave after a cupping.
When they give me an EKG the
suction cups won't stick because
of the hair on my chest. So the
EKG operators don’t look forward
to seeing me. Most of the nurses
are a little wary of me anyway
because I look at them
suspiciously everytime they come
to give me medication.

The only nurses I like are on the

annoyingly, but the doctor just
laughs and arranges me under the
scanning apparatus. He laughs
because he sees people in a lot
more trouble than I am. People
who are dying day by day. and he
has to find out how rapidly the
disease is choking off their life.

What Can You Say?

A small middle age woman
steps into the scanning room
while I am waiting to be wheeled
out. She talks nerVously to the
doctor about her husband. who has
just been scanned by other doctors
next door. “Why don't they do his
feet? You'd think they'd do his feet,
that’s where the pain is." She
makes me nervous. this middle
aged refugee from Brooklyn.
holding her worn fake fur in her
sweaty hands. I am relieved when
she leaves. until the doctor tells
me her husband is dying. “We,
don‘t scan his feet because the
disease is in his spine. In five
years. his lower spine will be
gone. But what can you say to the
lady? She knows."

They wheel me back to my room,
and I spend!!! 3904.99.“ 01th'epday.

Sometimes I fall asleep before the
night nurses leave the room. my
eyes closing on their shadows as
they move quietly around the
room. occasionally flicking the
small flashlights they carry at the
names above the beds.

The morning after the radiation
scan my doctor comes to see me.
“Hello Richard. How are YOU?”
he blurts. but doesn't seem to
listen when I reply. Sitting at the
foot of my bed. he nods
absentmindedly at everything I
say while he studies my chart.
ﬂipping the pages back and forth
and scribbling here and there.
After reviewing my chart he pokes
me in a few choice painful spots.
and then continues the discussion.

“Well Richard. according to all
the tests. you don’t have a
thrombosis (clot). Looks like a
pleural virus. In a few days you
can go home and rest—you'll be up
and around before you know it. No
more medication for you." He
throws me a quick smile on his
way out. stopping at the door to
add “Don't forget to tell mom and
dad. I'll be by tomorrow morning.“
He rushes out of the room to
another patient down the hallway.

I relax a little that afternoon,
thinking not about how sick I am
but rather how the hell I will ever
catch up in school when I go back.
And I also wonder if I will ever. by
fate or misfortune. wind up in the
hospital again. I hope I don't.
Hospitals depress me.

good things—especially
weddings—come in big
packages—the bigger. the better.

An Italian wedding shower is

not a shower; it's a deluge. I
expected my sister-in-law's in
Yonkers to be a small gathering of
close friends and relatives.
Scotch-Irish style. with
refreshments after the gifts. Her
shower turned' out to be a full-
course dinner for 80 women.

Gifts ranged from eight
identical Corningwars coffee pets
to a practical do-it-yourself kit for
the bride and groom's wedding
night. The announced contents of
that kit made me blush more than
the bride.

The bride’s 82-year-old
grandmother sat through it all.
clapping for each and every
present. The bride's middle-aged
aunts and cousins took turns
going to the ladies‘ room to sneak
a cigarette. They do not want'the
grandmother to know they smoke.

Italian wedding reception.

I've yet to hear of a small Italian
wedding. After all. Italians have
close family ties—the whole
family must be invited. What
Italian has less than 100 close
relatives?

Italians don’t shake hands when
they meet; they kiss. The modern

kiss one check. the traditional kiss

At a recent wedding cocktail hour.
I managed to balance a plate of
manicotti. scungllla 
and clams oreganato (“mange.

relatives with iny mouth full
without leaving a smear of sauce
on their cheeks. Now. that’s
Italian! 4
Italians like to watch kissing as
much as they like to do it. All
during the reception. the tinkling
of spoons against the water
glasses demands that the bride
and groom immediately kiss. The
couple hardly has time to eat.
During the roast beef dinner and

afterwards. there is music and

dancing. After a few gin and
tonics. I join in the tarantella.
Grabbing hands. forming a circle.

After the cake. coffee or

his wife go up and kiss the bride

After putting the envelope in her

woman a gift. The last wedding I
attended. the favor was a glass
candy dish' the one before. a small
bottle of champagne with “Maria
& Tony“ and the date on thelabel.

The bride and groom soon leave.
and guests gradually follow. The
night. however. is not over.
