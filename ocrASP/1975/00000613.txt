Are finals bothering you? If you know your abc's for the
multiple choice exams and don’t get sick before a
Nursing final you'll be all right.

You have tolook out forAstronomy. That can‘t be faster
than studying Computer. but it’ll be easier than trying to
make sense out of Logic. After the logic exam start
praying you'll pass Comparitive Religion, and find your
friend and discuss the hanky-panky the two of you will do
during the American Government test.

If you get depressed, think what a racket you had going
in your Tennis class last semester, or the theatre course
where you gave him some song-and-dance and was
passed with no work. Don’t worry! You have a good
chance on Probability and you can always bullshit your
Rhetoric prof.

Later in the week you're head may not be into
Neurophysiology. so buy Christmas gifts instead of
studying bible. But that'll remind you of Money and
Banking‘s final that night. so it might be better to go
hiking or climbing if you‘ve already finished the ecology

paper.

Other suggestions for the week: It is definitely
important to map out exactly how you study for
Cartography. Also. negotiate studying times for the
Labor Relations exam with your roommate. Don't argue
with him while preparing for your final debate.

In general. take it easy. Working on your shorthand
might speed things up. and you'll definitely breathe
easier after you finish your Atmosphere paper. By the
time you're finished. you'll realize it’s not necessary to

take Abnormal Psychology. J
