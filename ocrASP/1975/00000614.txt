by the senate on March. 19"" and
the debate over widely varying
interpretations of the bill has
occupied many hours on the
Senate floor. '

When asked about enforcement
of .Qgiyersity firearms policy on
campus. Jimes‘Williama director
of Security said that ithas bin
run in the same manner for the‘
past ten years. This. despite the
research. debate. and controversy
which has surrounded the issue
during that time.

Presently. there are 11 persons
on the security force qualified to
carry guns. They are all
supervisors and investigators.
and have all passed tests in
marksmanship and psychological
stability. according to Williams.
Seven of theese persons carry
firearms full time when on duty.
Court appearances and
continuous training sessions
cause situations to vary. Williams
said. "There are times when there
will be no one on duty who is
armed. and sometimes there is
more than one." he added.
Williams feels that they have
always been within policy.

Some senators. tired of an
apparently worn out issue. blame
the controversy on “SA
semantics". In order to understand

“twins of, firearms capo

“037- I x < '- .
It all started in July 1972 when

' John Hartley. Vice President for

Management and Planning issued
a directive to Williams which
discussed the situations during

. which firearms should be carried

by several selected members of the
security force.

One year later. on July 24.
1973.8UNY Central's Board of
Trustees established ‘a broad
policy which basically left
firearms use within the law. to the
discretion of the individual
campus security directors. The
only maJor restriction was in the
carrying of firearms in crowd
control situations. Specific
authorization had to be given by
the “chief administrative officer"
on each campus in such a
situation.

A growing on-campus crime
rate as well as the inability of city
police to respond quickly to on-
campus needs prompted these

decisions.

Then. in September 1978. Steve
Gerber. the then SA President.
discovered that certain members
of campus security were carrying
firearms without the proper
training. Though the situation
was soon righted. students were
angered by the fact that they had
not been consulted in the
establishment of a campus
firearm policy. Some questioned

the need for firearms in the first
place. The matter was handed over
to the University Community
Council (U.C.C), a subcommittee
of the Senate. where extensive
research resulted in the present
bill. It allows arming of Campus
Police in:

1. The guarding and
transportation of large amounts of
cash.

2. The arrest by warrant for
serious felonies\ or execution of
search warrants when the Director
of Campus Security has reason to
believe that the use of force may be
necessary.

3. The escorting of distinguished
campus visitors.

4. Conducting an investigation
possibly involving serious or
dangerous felony: and while on
motor patrol allowing rapid
response. Only one person at a
time will be so authorized unless
unusual circumstances exist.

The most controvercial part of
the bill is in section four. What is
an unusual circumstance? How
much discretion should the
director of Security be given in
making this decision?

The extent of disagreement in
interpretations of the Senate
firearmsbill has caused it to have
little or no effect on campus
security's firearms policy.

Students tend to support
extensive restrictions of firearms.
while security and administrators
more often support security‘s
present actions. SA President
Andy Bauman supports a strict
interpretation of the bill leaving
as little as possible up to the
security director. “I don’t think
that more than one cop should be
carrying a gun u -der any
circumstances outside of those
specifically mentioned inthe bill“.
be said in an interview. “Maybe
specific situations or categories
should be written up". he added.

Patricia Buchalter. director of
Student Activities. and presently
chairperson of the UCC. also
supports making an addition to
the bill in order to clarify the
intentions of the UCC.

A reinvestigation was done last
May by UCCin responseto anASP
article which reported that seven
persons were armed full time. The
UCC concluded that security was

the UCC in 1974 when the senate
bill was researched.

She explained some of the
considerations . ‘ made by the
committee. "We tried to look at

Security‘s needs on campus‘. she
said. “We considered the kinds of
crimes that occur. and when and
where they occur. We looked at in
terms of security's job“. she said.

On the other hand. she
continued. “we didn‘t want
everyone armed all the time". She
pointed out that training
requirements for officers on this
campus were more stringent that
is required. and noted the
accountability that security has
toward the . University. “If an
investigation showed poor
judgement on the part of security.
there would be ramifications". she
said.

"As long as you think that they
are doing their job.“ Buchauer
concluded. "you have to trust
them. I can’t tell them how to do
their jobs“.

Students Should Know

Rick Meckler. SA Vice
President. reiterated this point.
but added that students have a
right to know what is going on.
"There shouldn’t have to be an
ASP article to tell us what is going
on". he said.

Meckler feels that security is
violating policy. however. and
would like to see the bill rewritten
under the advice of Williams so
that it is enforceable. “We would
treat his (Williams') comments
very seriously“. he said. “I
wouldn't want to be held up with a
gun. and protected with night
sticks". he added.

Meckler did feel that under
normal conditions during the day.
no guns are necessary. He
emphasized the fact that when
dealing with students, extra.
caution should be taken.

Williams defended his policies
by noting an increase in crime on
campus. He told this reporter of
two reported robberies and a
student stabbing this month .“We
has a lot of people out armed in
these cases." he said. “These
things are not predictable".~
Though in many cases guns will
be drawn for such arrests. campus
security has never fired a gun. on-
campus. according to Williams.

DECEMBER 12, 1975

by Jay Burstein.
he headline in the New
1 York Post on July 9. 1971
reads “3d ROCK STAR,
JIM MORRISON. DEAD AT 27."
Doors fans around the world
mourn for their leader. savior.
idol. The “Lizard King." the figure
that was to lead the youth
generation of the sixties and
seventies into a revolution of
mind. spirit and soul is dead and
buried in the Poet‘s Corner of the
Pe‘re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.
The man who sang and wrote of
death is himself dead.

Morrison’s death has been
generally accepted. by his fans
and by his life insurance
company. and he is considered
legally dead. But there are many
queationable circumstances
under which he “died.” Just as
Clifford Irving wrote an
autobiography of Howard
Hughes. just as Paul McCartney is
dead. so is Jim Morrison dead, or
so it seems. This reporter thinks
Morrison. “sex-death. acid
evangelist of rock" is very much
alive.

Morrison sang of death. but not
of physical death. As Doors‘
producer Paul Rothchild puts it.

. Jim is fascinated with the
concept of death. He’s interested in
spiritual deaths. conceptual
deaths. more than physical deaths
actually." In the group's epic
song, "The End." Morrison deals
with such a conceptual death:

"Father?"

“Yes. son."

“I want to kill you.
Mother. I want to. . 

Producer Rothchild. in an
interview with Crawdaddy
Magazine. explains the meaning
of this phrase: “Kill the Father

 

means kill all of those things
inside yourself that areinstilled in
you and are not of yourself."

The group‘s first single
introduced the theme or the
purpose of the group. Entitled
“Break on Through." is a song of
revolution of the mind.

"You know the day destroys
the night

Night divides the day

Tried to run

Tried to hide

Break on thru to the other
side."

Only a year before he “died”
Morrison told rock critic Ellen
Sander he'd rather consider
himself a writer and a poet. He
said rock and roll was dead or at
least decadent and he was sadto be
a part of the whole thing.

In the August. 1972 issue of Hit
Parader the other Doors were
asked if the audiences' attitude
toward him gave Morrison the
urge to take off. Robbie Krieger.
the group's guitarist said “Sure.
That was one of the big reasons.
They wanted to see a freak pull his
pants down. and he was sick of it."
Ray Manzarek. organist. added.
“We didn‘t start this whole thing
for that reason. We startedto make
music. and near the end it got to be
a freak show. Let's see the geek
pull his pants down. bite the head
off a chicken or something. And
Jim said. uh-uh. no. that's not me.
So he just split.“

Morrison sang of death. true. but
also called for a rebirth as is
expressed in theselinesfrom“’l‘he
End":

“Lost in a Roman Wilderness

of pain
And all the children areinsane
Waiting for the summerrain.”
What Morrison means here is

that he sees a society that isf
and self destructiVe. but they

_ ,. s  ; , ,
are waiting for a death followed by

a rebirth. a cleansing of the soul...
He also brought up the concept of
insanity. perhaps the true vehicle

- to take on the road to freedom. In

his theatre composition}.
“Celebration of the Lizard"
Morrison. chants. "Forget the
world, forget the peeple and we'll.
erect a different steeple.” Forget
your past and build a new you. and
a new world and civilization.

So much for Morrison's motive.
Now I would like to put the pieces
together into a believable story.

Morrison. unhappy with his
career and with himself leaves Los
Angeles for Paris. where no one
knows him. and is accompanied by
his wife. Pamela. and manager.
Bill Siddons. Morrison plans his
“death” with Siddons and possibly
Pamela.

July third. Pamela finds Jim
dead in the bathtub of their
apartment. Siddons calls for a
doctor who. as was previously
arranged. signs a phony death
certificate. (Manzarek explained
in an interview in Downbeat that
the certificate put as the cause of
death. his heart stopped.) He is
allegedly buried at a small funeral
with only a few friends in
attendance. But none of the Doors-
were there nor were any of his
closest friends here in the U.S.

The news release stated that

PHANTOM

the body. . “ ' ‘ ‘ I :

Though the case is not officially , ' I

being lookinto by hislinsurance A

mystery. W'book. en tied: “The
Great Louisiana Bank Robbery."
written by one James D. Morrison
is soon to be published and is to
tell of a great rock star who faked
his own death and collected his
own life insurance. Another hoax.
or just a cheap shot at adeadman?
The Morrison mystery gets more
intriguing every day and there
seems to be a lot of money being
made on it. Capitol Records now
handles a man by the name of THE
V who. incredibly
enough. sounds exactly like
Morrison. and writes in
Morrison's style.

Is Morrison behind it all? Is he
the Phantom‘s ghost writer? He
has allegedly been seen in LA.
where he picked up hitchhikers
and told them his story. He has
also been allegedly seen in New
York's Village and in West
Germany.

If Morrison does finally come
out of hiding millions of people
will flock- to see him. but the
Internal Revenue Service will. no
doubt. get first crack at him.
