 Rick Wakeman can get a

‘ If‘you listento albums. you will
find that certain keyboard players
sound the same on different cuts.
The reason for this is because the
synthesizer is set on or near the
same setting. Jazz musicians lose
something. 'in their performance
when they vary it to please an
audience that wouldn't listen to
their normal stuff.

Yet performers continue to play
this type of jazz(?). The past year
saw performers like GeorgeDuke.
Alphonse Mouzon, Jean-Lac
Ponty. Harvey Mason and others
attempt to really make it on their
own and become more successful.

The move towards
commercialism has also hit the
world of straight jazz. with many
artists trying to break a soul
single on the radio. Someone came
up with the word disco and
attached it to soul music, and so
now anyone can play it and be
accepted by a wide cross section of
the younger set.

Some performers did it on just
one cut. while others made their
whole album soul. Some did make
a hit. others had increased album

but they were not playing jazz and
hurt jazz in general as a result.
E mploying an incomplete

’ knowledge of soul hurts the jazz

performer as much as it hurts the
rock artist. ‘ r

H In H honor of the commercial
people I have made up a new
category. for my list of top
performers in jazz. They ‘are the,
best can men in jazz who are now
playing below their level of
performance and no longer are
creative musicians.

The category of top individual
performers was based on past and
present performances. weighing
both versatility and consistency.
Unless a musician has really gone
downhill. his past performances
will help him when it's a tossup.
The best albums were based on
creativity and level of
performances.

CON MEN:

Herbie Mann—Mann is exploiting
lesser known groups by using his
name and backing to record hits
that the other groups have already
recorded. Flute was never really
used before in soul music as alead.
so Mann is in the background
much of the time.

Eddie Harris—Long an
outstanding player of straight
jazz. Harris has now taken to
appearing on soul train and is

judging more money with a new
ffast and funky electronic sound;
ﬁygrble Hancock and Chick
.carea—These two men are
Tainan. in that they are like the
“keyboard players previouly
mentioned in the section on
electronic jazz. Both men’s
"strongpoint lies in acoustics.
nmsey Lewis—The stuff he plays
 hardly be consideredjazz. His
fjut album was good. but his new
one is slop.

TOP PERFORMERS:

DRUMS—1. Billy Cobham 2.
Buddy Rich 3. Elvin Jones 4. Tony
Williams 5. Jack Dejohnette—
Cobham simply does more things
with drums than the others do.
Guitar—1. George Benson 2. John
Mclaughlin 3. Kenny Burrell 4. Joe
. Pass 5., David T. Walker—All are
good. but Bensen has the
consistency.

Bass—1. Stanley Clarke 2. Ron
Carter 3. Paul Jackson 4. Chuck
Rainey 5. Ray Brown—Stanley
Clarke handles a bass like it's a
.toy.

Piano—1. Oscar Peterson 2. Herbie
Hancock 3. Chick Corea 4. Keith
Jarrett 5. Bob J ames—The last four
are good. but no one can touch
Oscar Peterson.

Percussion—1. Bill Summers 2.
Airto Moreira 3. Ralph MacDonald
4. Ray Barretto 5. Ray Mantilla—
summers plays percussion

come.

time and time again.
Flute—1. Bobbi Humphrey 2.
Hubert Laws 3. Herbie Mann 4.
Yusef Lateef 5. Rahsaan Roland
Kirk—Humphrey takes top spot
while Laws and Mann bug out.
There are more instruments and
some singers I could touch. but
these intruments above appear to
run jazz now.
Musician—1. Rahsaan Roland
Kirk 2. Yusef Latest—This
category was based on the ability
to play differect instruments and
play them well. These two play a
variety of instruments. with Kirk
getting the nod. He plays many
horns. invents his own
instruments. plays two or three
home at a time. and does all this
despite being blind since birth.
Combo—1. Return to Forever 2.
Lonnie Liston Smith and the
Cosmic Echoes 3. Herbie Hancock
and the Headhunters 4. Brecker
Brothers 5. Crusaders—Hard to
beat the overall talent of Return to

   
   

Billy Cobham.

Forever.

Stanley Clarke 3. Quincy Jones 4.
Billy Cobham 5. Eumir Deodato—
Mizell has done the most in terms
of creativity, while working with
different performers.

Arranger— 1. Quincy Jones 2.
Larry Mizell 3. Bob James 4.
Eumir Deodato—Jones arranges

everything and does it very well.

Best New Artist—Roland Hanna—
Although he’s been around. this
past year marked his debut as a
soloist and what a debut.

Best New Combo—Tom Scott and
the L. A. Express—A new
progressive jazz combo

highlighting Tom Scott on sax.

Jazz will take another fall to
commercialism in the future. until
it dies out. Then. more performers
will come forward and attempt to
make new sounds with the
influences of straight jazz. lt's
unavoidable because electronic is
tiring at times and the disco scene
will die eventually. The old time
greats will never change and they
will continue to play music for the
older people.

If jazz doesn’t return to normal.
the jazz musician of the future will
be rock type musicians. who can
put out some weird sounds.
