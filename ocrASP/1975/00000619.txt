ill Austin, the rookie head
B JV Basketball coach here

. at Albany, is a man with
some definite ideas about how the
game should be played

"I believe hard work is the most
important factor in becoming a
success in this sport." Austin
says. “You have to work. work
some more, and then work a little
harder."

It sounds like a simple enough
formula. Yet Austin says the
biggest dissappointment he's
come across while dealing with
collegiate athletes for the first
time is a lack of desire.

“There are alot of guys herewhc
simply don't care enough to make
themselves better basketball
players." the coach said. “They
either came to Albany thinking
they were too good already. orthey
don't want to make the sacrifice
and give that extra effort."

Bill Austin is a man himself
used to giving that extra effort. A
collegiate success at Boston
University where he played ball
on a four year scholarship. Austin
worked his way onto a
professional roster. Though he
didn't swing elbows with Willie
Reed. Austin did spend one and a
half years with the Cleveland
Pipers of the American Basketball
League.

"The ABL was Abe Saperstein's
baby. I guess you could say the
league was the first coming of the
ABA we know today. The salaries
they gave us back then were not
quite what they are today;
though." Austin laughs.

When the Pipers found too much
red ink in the accountinglogs. Bill
Austin found a home at Colonie
Central High.

a orosstown‘
neighbor of Albany State. For the; '
past eleven years Bill Austin has.

 It’s like they've never really been

u rdeinen ‘

there; track and field. baseball,
football—even basketball.

"We won championships at
Colonic (5 Suburban Council titles
in a row) because we worked
harder in preparing ourselves
than anybody else. We were
fundamentally sound. and
fundamentals make 'all the
difference in the world."

The coach admits he was
surprised by the lack of
fundamentals his first collegiate
crop of athletes had.

“The biggest adjustment I
thought I would make in
switching from high school to
college was not having to go
through the rigors of teaching
fundamentals all over again. Boy.
was I wrong. Nowadays a lot of
guys go right through high school
without any training in the basics.

coached before.“ ,

' * And being the stickler for detail

that he is. Bill Austin set out the
first day of practice to make sure
his players get taught.prcperly.

That first day of practice brought

to a head another inorirninatory
aspect of collegiate sports in the
coach's mind.

“There are a helluva lot of guys
with great basketball talent
roaming around this university
who won't be scoring baskets for

Doe and myself this year." Austin

said. “I’ve already lost half a dozen
guys who showed up to practice a
few times. didn't like the way our
program is run. and just drifted
out of the picture."

Not only does Austin's JV roster
suffer from those walkoffs, but
Doc Sauers’ varsity feels the pinch
also.

“There are about four or five
guys who should be pushing
varsity players for jobs right now.
Instead, they’re off somewhere.
playing intramurals and pick.up
games." says the coach. “And I
know for a fact Doc personally
helped some of these guys get into
school here."

Austin's point is well taken
when you consider the all-too-

'obvious defection of JV talent

recently here at Albany. A quick
history lesson reveals from the
starting five of Bob Lewis‘ record-
breaking 17-3 JV team of 2 years
past. only Bob Audi even showed
up at varsity practice the next fall.
Names like Miller. Snyder. Ferris
and Valenti. simply drifted into
oblivion. never to be seen in
uniform again. This season. only
Steve Macklin and Eric Walton are
up from a 14-5 team. What happens
to all this talent between
semesters? Why the mass exodus?

“Not being close to the situation
until now. I can only speculate it’s
because of a lack of. seriousness

.about the game these guys had."

ASPECTS '

Austin said. “You haveto makean
all-year committment to
basketball if you "want to play
better. Maybe the guys who didn’t
show up after their first yearjust
didn’t want to be bothered any
more.”

‘fl'll tell you one thing that’s not
the reason for the defections and
that's because of prejudice.
There's not a prejudiced bone in
my body and I'm sure Doc would
say the same. Everybody has a
shot to play here. And I resent any
implications that it's any other
way. The guys who use prejudice
as an excuse are merely alibiers."

Whatever the reasons. Bill

Back to work. You know,
you can never get enough
hard work.

 

Austin is confident his current JV
players will not follow the
disappearing act of the two
preceeding teams.

“I'm very pleased with my team.
They've done all I’ve asked of them
and then some. Maybe it's-better
now that the guys who really
weren't serious about playing are
gone." ,

Austin approaches this season
optimistically, both for his JVs
and the big team.

“Doe and I work closely so I
know the talent he has on the
varsity. Don't write off Albany
State this year. on either level."

At that point coach Austin
pointed to a clock on the wall. and
terminated the interview.

“Back to work." he said. “You
know. you can never get enough
hard work.“
