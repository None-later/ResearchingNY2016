 

 Attempts To Recipe English
Doctoral Program Cause Controversy

by Belly Stein

Like a receding tide dragging the
beach away with it. the last students
to receive their English PILD. at
SUNYA will take the tradition of
that graduate program away with
them.

Citing the need to eliminate in-
ferior programs duplicated
elsewhere in the state. Education
Commissioner Ewald B. Nyquist'
ordered the termination of

SUNYA‘s English doctoral program
early last December.

But the matter is not closed.

Reversal Sought

President Emmett 8. Fields. seek-
ing a reversal of this decision, has
planned a series of moves aimed at
re-registering the Ph. D. program. an
effort that has already caused much
controversy within the department.

Part oithat effort. accordingtoan
advisory report. includes the crea-

at theexpense of several junior facul-

ty positions.

Some members ofthe faculty feel
that undergraduate education will be
hurt by that change.

“He's interested in bringing
SUNYA national prominence." says
English professor Jeffrey Herman.
"but it's almost an inevitability that
the undergraduate education will
suffer . . . not in theory. but in
practice."

Sacriﬁce Justifed

Other faculty members see the
Ph.D. program as a necessity that
justiﬁes any sacrifice that may be
made.

"it's not a simple trade-off.
.What Fields is doing has to be
done.“ says faculty member Donald
Staufl'cr. “The feeling is that we‘re
building a mammoth Ph.D.
program and the undergraduate will
go to hell. That isn't going to
happen.“

The plan that caused this polariza-
tion inthe department was drawn up
last November by three outside
evaluators brought in by l‘iclds..'\s
