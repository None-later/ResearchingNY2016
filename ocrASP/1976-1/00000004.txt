 But nddifﬁ'h a split in the ranks
of the lar'st and most powerful
felnim'acorﬁnization in America——
—-tlse National Orpution of
Women (NOW)-—. the ERA may
be only theﬁrst of many casualties in
the most recent war between women
and women. .

The sides were drawn at a recent
conference in Philadelphia where a
NOWraction calling itself “The Ma-
jority Caucus" won twothirds of the
seats on NOW's national board with
the slogan “Out of the mainstream
into the revolution.”

In one of its campaign newsletters.
the Majority Caucus explained that
their platform “commits us not just
to get women into the mainstream of
American life, buttochange the very
nature of that mainstream itself.”

The newsldter went on to saythat
“to achieve equality in a societythat
is fundamentally corrupt. com-
passionless, dehumanizing and
destructive is to stop short of realiz-
ing our own full potential for social
change . . ."

Few times in NOW‘s l0-year
history have such radical ideas been
proposed to its 60.000 members.

NOW has always sought support
from women “whoenjoy beingwives
and mothers” and whose most
radical ideas include child care.
equal accesstocredit, betterjobs and
improved income.

These are the women who will be
alienated by NOW’s new leadership.
according to the; NOW conference
delegates who lost their bids for the
national board. Many of the
defeated delegates subsequently
formed their own faction. “Women-
surge." to decide how to put NOW
back on its old track.

“You don't make the great strides
on child cart: andjobs and credit and
things by alienating the people you
want that from." one Womensurge
member said.

The Womcnsurge group is expec-
ting that the new priorities approved
at the Philadelphia conference—
Iesbian rights and alliance with
Third World and working women~~
“will frighten most women."

The distension in the ranks has
proven to be more than the usual

such diverse organizations as NOW.

Bus ‘ services Cut

by Sue Emerson

Recent reductions in the SUNYA
bus schedule have sparked con-
troversy between student leaders and
administrators concerning wherethc
cuts were made. and whether or not
they were necessary.

While some student leaders ex-
pressed surpriscthut cuts were made.
Plant Superintendent lrtt DcVoc ud-
mits that. “before Christmas vaca-
tion‘ re knew we were goingto have
to make cuts.“

DeVoe says that the bus schedule
is now limited by laws pertaining to
the hiring and scheduling of drivers
as well as the economic situation.

'According to Central Council
Chuirperson Dave Coync. the most
signiﬁcant cuts in the schedule occur
during the hours between 3 pm. and
7:45 p. m. on weekdays and inthe late
evenings on weekends. Both ofthese
time periods are reﬂected its ones of

alternative [to the cuts]. If that‘s the
reality. that's the reality. In terms of
where the cuts were made. there
could have been better cuts.

Motor Pool Supervisor Jack
Olsen says that the cuts were made
on the basis of his trip sheets, those
sheets which reﬂect how many peo-
ple are riding which buses.

“We made the cuts where the least
people rode." relates Olson. Accor-

doesn't change." Problem areas in the
schedule will be alleviated, if possi-
ble. by sending any available extra
buses. As long as there's a man and
there‘s at problem. a bus goes out."
Working with a shortage of
drivers as well as legal restrictions
limiting their hours is difﬁcult. says
Olsen. He claims that these
supplemental runs are not always
possible andgtherei'orc will not be
