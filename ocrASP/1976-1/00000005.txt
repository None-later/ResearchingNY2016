ﬁcial of the American Association of
Medical Colleges. “It's no secret that
some of the students feel that
cheating is necessary to protect their

futures.”
Because of anincrease in cheating,

particularly in the science courses re-
quired of pre-med students, Johns
Hopkins University in Maryland
recently replaced its old honor code
with a tougher new policy that con-
tains measures for enforcing
academic honesty.

Cheating techniques, accordingto
Johns Hopkins Dean Sigmund R.
Suskind, ran the gamut from crib-
bing and copying during ex-
aminations to such extremes as
students deliberately altering other
students‘ lab experiments to gain a
competitive edge in class standings.

“What I‘m concerned about isthc
ﬂagrant examples." said Suskind.
“Large groups working together.
major cribbing. alteration of ex-
periments. theft of exams, major
cooperative efforts."

“Students who were‘nia menu,
but. who  going to 
chemists weren't bothered with.”
said one former pre-med student

. who was dismayed by the competi-

tion. “it was all done by pre-nteds

with the attitude of ‘You might be

the one who keeps me out of medical
school.‘ " . .- ’

i ‘ Aside from altered experiments.
another popular cheating tactic at
Stanford is stealing library books‘
needed for the identiﬁcation of
chemical compounds. This prevents
“correct analysis of unknowns and
causes a lot of hassles," reported a
senior pre-med student.

At Ohio State University. several
prc-med students have reported
stolen lab notebooks, or notebooks
“borrowed” just before grading and
returned with lab reports torn out.

No one expects that the thieves'

will be caught. “Most cheating isn't
even reported," said an Ohio State
biology professor. “Students aren‘t
willing to turn other students in."
Pan of the problem in stopping
pre-med cheating is the penalty for
the crime—failure in the course. “To
fail a kid in a course. especially in a
pre-professional school is like a
sentence for life because it means
they will never make it into law or

 

medical school.” said an Ohio State
student. “Profs know that and some
even look the other way.”
Although most school ofﬁcials
direct their attention to the almost
hopeless cause of weeding- out
oilenders. others believe cheatingin~
dicates underlying problems in the
criteria medical schools useto screen
applicants. '
“An obsession with grade point
averages is an unfortunate way to
select good practitioners of
medicine," says Albert Gelhorn,
director of the Center for Biomedical

' Education at City College of New

York.

In I970, according to Gelhorn,
pie-med students from several un-
iversities told him:“ ‘We cheat. We
try to give wrong information to our
colleagues. We sabotage chemistry
experiments.‘ Things have gotten
worse since then." said Gelhorn.
“Pro-med school is a cutthroat
business.“

The solution to cheating, says
Gelhorn, begins with a re-
examination of medical education.
“We shouldn't be looking for
someone who does well in organic
chemistry—something the prac-
ticing physician rarely uses—but
someone with a concern for taking
care of people."

by Mue Leve ,

Auditions have already started for
this years Telethon, which is
scheduled for March l9-20. and will
continue through February. Though
this may seem like a longtime away,
planning is already in full swing for
what has become one of SUNYA's
main annual events.

This fund-raising affair will take
place in the Campus Center
Ballroom, as it hasin previous years.
The theme this year is “look to the
children". The goal is to beat last
year’s total of Sl6,000. All of the
money raised goesto the Wildwood
School for developmentally han-
dicapped students.

Some of last year‘s most successful
acts such as Chet Arthur and his
Homing Aces will return. Inter-

The only change in the format of
the acts will be an emphasis on the
children, in keeping with this year's
theme. Co-chairman Ed Chadwick
said that, “Because of" a lack of
emphasis on the children and on our
purpose in former years, we‘ve
chosen a theme directed toward
them. We’re going to bring children
on stage to show that entertainment
is not our primary purpose.”

There will be a “children's hour"
on Saturday morning (March 20).
during which the children will play a
major role. This will include a type of
Disney Carnival and a Romper
Room feature.

Mayor Corning, Assemblyman
Field and other local politicians will
address the Telethon as will SUNYA
President Fields. Locul coverage of
the event will include broadcasting
on channels 6 and 10.

Most of the money raised in the 130

will also take part. The Telethon

ring to get faculty more salve. Those 3
who have come in the past have
given a good response. but small
numbers came.”

Telethon has received donations
in the past from the community. but
this year the staff is trying even more
to get cooperation and responses
from it. “We want the community to
be aware of telethon and that they
have an opportunity to come to the
Campus Center and participate in
it.“ said Chadwick.

Stay tuned for details . . .

Wildwood is about 600. This
number continues to grow. There is
need for more services and different
kinds of programs as the school ex-
pands, according to Wildwood's
director Cheryl Gould.

The programs cost upto $300,000
year. $180,000 of which is covered by
State and federal funds. The remain-
ing $l20,fif)() is raised by the school
and is matched by the County Board
of Mental Health. meaningthatthey
must raise $60,000. Telethon helps
pay a large amount of that.

The Telethon . said Gould. “is an
experience that becomes more
rewarding and exciting. The efforts

 

of the students are appreciated."

responded sufficiently to the needs
of the school, says Gould, who hopes'
the campus will set an example for
the community.

“The telethon has given us a
tremendous image in the communi-
ty. and our beneﬁt has been all year
round and not just at the time ofthe
telethon. We have even planned our
activities around the Telethon.“

Telethon‘s activities have-already
begun. They have raised SL600. In
February there will be a food fast
which is expected to raise $3.000.
But of course. the big event is on
MarchI9-20.

"Telethon." said Chadwick, “is a
lot of hard work but worth it. lnthe
end, if all the money we‘ve raised can
help one child. then its worth all the
sacriﬁce all through the year."
