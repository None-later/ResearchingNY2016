JANUARY 23, 1976

WELCOME TO 1976. The Albany Student Press is
greeting the spring semester, the new year and the
bicentennial with some small cosmetic changes. We
won’t be able to print every issue in red, white and
blue ink but we will be changing the look of
aspirations unlimited. our arts section, and
ASPects, our magazine section.

Last semester’s once-a-month ASPects
magazingsgcmcd to evokea lot of “What the hell is
this?” and “Where’s the regular ASP?” So, in an ef-
fort to dissipatensome. ofthe confusion, we’ve decid-
ed to combine the maganziiic‘ with the arts section
and pull everything together under the name
ASPects.

This means that every Friday you’ll be able to
find the arts —— ﬁlms, plays, music, books, televi-
sion, fiction, poetry —— as well as features on all sub-
jects in this nice, handy, removable eight-page sec-
tion. ASPects will become sort of a catch-all for
everything that isn’t hard news, sports or editorial
comment.

Meanwhile, the aspirations name will live on
in the Tuesday edition ofthe ASP, dealing with the
arts only— more specifically, with the events of the
previous , nd.

v Fur’t r-Iannouncements: To help you out on
dull wee ends, the preview/ leisure page will add a
calendar of community events. Regular features
like The Classical Forum and Media Madness will
still be with us, as well as a new semi-weekly column
on jazz and soul, The Musical Spectrum. Enjoy.
