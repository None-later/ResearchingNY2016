'_  professional team sport with
the most data is basketball. The
pr aimity of the lam half-naked
 to the fans invites participa-
tion. Only in basketball do I have a
 of audience/player contact. An
 dimension of excitement is
added each time one ofJbese power-
ful  leapsintothe stands after a
driving lay-up. The phobia of being
drenched with someone else‘s sweat

tion.

Watching hockey live ltend to fall
apart from the players as though I
am looking at ﬁsh through the glass
divider. I feel the most ostrasizcd at
huge spacious stadiums,. especially
football games. At least you can seea
baseball player‘s face. Football, with
its jousting knights in plastic armor.
represents one extreme in
audience/player relationships and
basketball. with it's ﬂashy un-
derwear garbcd atheletes. the other.

The latter invites active participa-
tion while the former is the epitome
of vicarious viewing. Seeing basket-
ball live and on T. V. aretwo diverse
experiences. Live or on the box,
football. in all its glory. is pretty
much the same event. With the use of
IO different cameras and close zoom
lenses. the essence of tough football
is even enhanced by television.

Why more class in basketball? In
basketball, the culminaiton of each
season's playoffs is simply called.
“The Championship Playoffs". No
hype needed. The fans supply all the
exu'tement. ln hockey we have the
Stanley Curl plpyoftg in all; fairness.

 

contributes to my vigilant partieipa- .

thee also supply all the hoopla
needed to create an event out of a
championship. However. they lose a
few points in class because there are
more than a few people who do not
know who Mr. Cup is.

Calling baseball ﬁnals the World
Series is excusable since it is the

11s.

  

The ancient Spartans were not
given to much speech-making.
Rather. they knew how to say much
in a few words. to be concise. Such
speech to this day is called Laeonic.
after Laconia. the district of which
Sparta was the capital.

The Spartan Chilon is counted
among the “Seven Sages" of Greece,
keeping company with such notables
as Solon of Athens and Periander of
Corinth. Some of our sources at-
tribute to him the most famous of all
Greek maxims. “Know Thyself."

A collection of famous Spartan
sayings was made by Plutarch (ca 46-
l25 A.D.). an admirer of the old
Spartan virtues. Many of these
sayings. as one might expect. haveto
do with martial courage.

When the Spartan King Agesilaus
was asked how far the boundaries of
Sparta extended. he ﬂourished his
spear and said, “As far as this can
reach.” The Spartan King Agis.
when he observed how high and
strong the walls of Corinth were.
asked “What women live in the
place?" Sparta itself was unfortiﬁed,

at its best. However, the most
pretentious of all ﬁnal contest titles
is the one called Super Bowl.
There are three common uses of
the word super: I) “Hey. that dress is

is supposed to have remarked that
the crowning glory of a city is men
and not stones.

At the famous battle of Ther-
mopylae in 480 B.C. one of
Leonidas‘ men remarked that.
because of the arrows of the Per-
sians. it was impossible to see the
sun. Leonides replied, “Good. then
we shall ﬁght in the shade." A Spar-
tan woman. in answer to her son‘s
complaint that his sword was too
short. said. “Add a step to it."

The Spartan system of education,
or rather training.was mostaustere.
When Spartans were asked what
boys ought to learn they were apt to
respond. “That which they will use
when they become men." or similar
words to that effect. Obedience. ser-
vice. and respect for the law were
greatly valued. One Spartan, having
been condemned to death and being
led away. seemed quite happy. In
response to the inquiries of some
bystanders he explained, “I rejoice to

Admitedly. this Super. Bowlwas

past championship highlights were
refreshingiy creative and enter-

biggest surprise. In these times of

done with taste and restraint. lcould
even hear what words were being

The Spartans were wont to use
this manner of speech even in their
foreign relations. When Philip of
Macedonia approached Sparta he
inquired of the Spaitans whether
they wished him to come asa friend
or a foe. They replied. "NEith'er."

At least one Spartan. however.
had a rather twisted sense of honor.
King Cleomenes—known for his
part in the expulsion of the
Pisistratid tyrants from Athens in
510 BC—once concluded an ar-

Of course, CBS executivesvfeel the
only. way to keep women gluedto the
television set is to show something
"girlie". So. we saw a Super Bowl
fashion show and. talked. to the
player's wives about Coach Landry's
decision allowing them to sleep with
their husbands the night before the
game. And I always thought it was
masturbation that hinders your
