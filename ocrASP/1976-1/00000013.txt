‘ Angola
Intervention

by Robert Bertell ‘

As high-powered CIA operatives are
dispatched to Angola with millions of
dollars of bribe money as well as
helicopters, missiles and other hardware.
you may ask. “Why, WHY this new
potential Vietnam in Africa?“

What we see now in Angola is the
emerging part of the iceberg of Soviet-
American relations and the interests and
motives which determine our
government‘s world policies. As you may
already have heard, Angola is a very rich
morseI of the former Portuguese empire.
It’s nearly as big as Alaska but all in the
temperate zone. it has many millions of
acres of rich farmland . . . gold,
diamonds, rare and strategic minerals of
all kinds . . . and all, big oil offshore
along its LOGO-mile South Atlantic coast.

Next door. Rhodesia and South Africa
boast thethickest coal seams in‘the World,
the biggest gold mines and the richest dia-
mond ﬁelds. Angola‘s very rich farmland.
prosperous industries and vast natural
resources are up for grabs. That is why
otir CIA and the Soviet KGBare slugging
it out there. Nobody knows where that
slug-fest is going to take us. Our govern-
ment has had clandestine W covert
operations in Angola ever since the
Iiiscnhower Administration. when the
anti—communist. staunchly pro-
Ainerican Salazar regime was in power in
Portugal.

,A‘.‘ i

.,:‘. U ’_‘)‘V‘~€H‘>

But those operations were getting
nowhere until Henry Kissinger cameinto
ofﬁce as President Nixon's segundo —in
charge of foreign affairs. Using his
powers as the White House chief
operative of the CIA. he “destabilized”
the anti-communist regime in Portugal
and assisted in the socialization of the
Lisbon government.

Of course the Soviets were also duly
represented. The big idea was to give the
bum's rush to the white regimes in
Southern Africa — Portuguese Angola
and Mozambique. English Rhodesia and
Anglo-Dutch South Africa. A grandiose
scheme. the South African Trading Zone
(SATZ). was to supervise the white man's
rule in the area. In that grand scheme the
Rockefeller family, together with its
allies, the Rothschilds and the billionaire
'Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
were to be on the ground floor. They were
to divide among themselves the entire
boodlc — the immense wealth in gold.
diamonds. other minerals and oil to be
found in the area.

Kissinger had in his corner the Prime
Minister of South Africa, John Vorster.
whose prime purpose seems to be to
sacriﬁce Rhodesia‘s English settlers to
gain time for himself. It was a beautiful
plan — ﬁnancially — for the Rockefeller
family and the international bankers.

But things went wrong. The Soviets
also had ambitions in Angola and are in
there now with thousands of Cuban
troops and sophisticated Soviet equip—
ment. And Kissinger has been forced to
turn to South Africa to rescue the
Rockefeller operation and prevent the
uholc area from falling iiilo Soviet
domain ... :in unlike!) alliance hut vital

Reactionary scum from different regions of the world are assembled in the  -
of interventionist}. who have thrust into Angola . . . . The intervention by‘the '
racialist and imperialist forces in Angola is e defiance toellfreedom-Iovirrg peoples. _

—Pravda, Moscow. USSR (Communist Party dgily).- ‘

Obviously Soviet policy is now being shaped by the Kremlin “hawks”. . .atid they .1
are very sure of victory . . . .Just a few months after the Helsinki pledges they are ~

openly intervening in Angola . . . .And closer observingthe immowilyd
the U.S.

———Frankfurrer Allgemeine. Frankfurt, Germany (conservative)

The position of Congress is shaped by fear of a Vietnam on African soil. . . .But
the U.S. holds some winning cards. . . .The U.S. is one of the few countries that can
provide the Russian people their scanty supply of daily bread.

——Sven.rka Dagbladei. Stokholm. Sweden (conservative).

Despite White House alarmist language. this is not a new-isolationist reaction.
Congress wants voice in foreign policy and most Senators feel the U.S. has no vital
interests at stake .in Angola.

——Carri‘ere della Sera. Milan, Italy Kindepcndent).

. .
Chinese representative Lai YaI-Ii denounced the two superpowers. particularly the
Soviet Union. for their acts of interference in Angola and pushing hegemony in Africa.
He said the Soviet slander about Chinese “interference in the internal affairs of Africa”

is the despicable trick of a thief crying “catch the thief."
——Ta Kung Pao. Hong Kong (Maoist weekly).

In some ways the challenge is no less momentous in Angola than it was a decade ago
in Cuba . . . .But the Bicentennial year cannot and must not coincide with a laying
down of the United States‘ historic burden. That would be new declaration of
independence which would disgrace the achievements of the past.

~—Dai'ly Telegraph, London, England (conservative).

How they must be Iaughingin the Kremlin! While the American Senate votestocul
off all aid to the anti-Communists in Angola . . .Ihc Americans are saving the
ﬂoundering Russian economy by supplying it with millions of tons of grain. This is
detente gone deranged.
