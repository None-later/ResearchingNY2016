Steve Weisman sank a three-foot
rebound shot with two seconds left
in the game to give Panama Red is
32—30 upset victory Versus Chosen
Five in League I basketball. Mon-
day.
The Red enteredthc gametrailing
the undefeated Chosen Five by a
game and a half in their battle for
ﬁrst place; their lone loss coming
against GIO early in the season.

After a slow first half which ended
in a l4—l4 tie, the Red opened a
seven point lead on a pair of three
point plays by Steve Schantz and a
Weisman free throw, only to have
the Chosen Five storm back totake a
27~—26 lead with less than two
minutes to play, as Brad Biggs ran
off four uncontested ﬁeld goals.

The lead see-sawed, and then
knotted at 30 all with eighteen
seconds to play and the Red in
possession. A set play eventually
opened up a ten-footer for Rich
Kapner which hit off the rim, but
Weisman was there to convert the
rebound.

Steve Schantz led all scorers with
ll points. Biggs had nine for the
Chosen Five.
