wi 96-93 win against-Urban in
_ the first‘ round ‘of the Muskingurn
Tournament, but suffered the loss of
Cavanaugh'in that one. The Danes
dropped the championship match to
the hosts, 61-59, without their six-
foot. seven-inch freshman center.

With Cavariaugh limping heavily
and playing well- below 100 percent.
the Danes met disasterinthe Capital
District Tournament, losing to- “’1
79-65, and falling to Union, 72-49.

in the three defeats. the Danes
shot just 36.5 percent from the ﬁeld
and 60 percent from the line. after
recording 47.5 percent and 72.1 per-
cent in their ﬁrst ﬁve games.

At Southern Conn. the Danes lost
more than a ballgame. as
Suprunowicz hurt his knee while the
Danes blew an eight-point lead in the
ﬁnal four and a half minutes of the
game. While Albany‘s ﬁeld goal
percentage improved (53.6). the
Danes were 4 for 10 from the free
throw line.

The four game skid ended in
Geneseo with a 73-58 win, but
returned the following night with a
63-62 heartbreaking loss at Buffalo.
Albany played both games without
Suprunowicz and Audi (flu), but
Kevin Keane came off the bench to
score 29 points and haul down 17
rebounds to take up the slack. 1n the
Buffalo contest, the Danes twice
overcame 14-point deﬁcits only to
have the game taken away from
them when an ofﬁcial ruled time had
expired before Bob Barker was
fouled. thus preventing him from go-
ing to the line and possibly changing
the outcome.

Sabres Slash Schedule To Keep
Braves Happy - And In Buffalo

BUFFALO AP—The Buffalo
Sabres hockey club said Thursday it
is willing to talk with ofﬁcials of the
Buffalo Braves basketball team
about a dispute that has led to a
possible move of the Braves.

“Our city is major league and we
are vitally interested in keeping the
Bravesin Buffalo." the Sabres said in
a statement issued after its ex-
ecutives returned from a National
Hockey League meeting in
Philadelphia.

The Sabres said they arewillingto
meet with Braves ofﬁcials and city
representatives to arrive at practical
arrangements which are in the best
interest of the teams and the city.

' Owner Paul Snyder of the Braves
has complained that he is unable to
get satisfactory dates forthe Braves‘
home games inthe National Basket-r
ball Association at city-owned

Memorial Auditorium.

The Braves usually play on Tues-

day and Friday nights. but Snyder
said he would prefer a Wednesday
and Saturday schedule.
v Under terms of the Sabres‘ lease.
the hockey team is the primary te-
nant .and has reserved Wednesdays
for the 1976-77 season.

Earlier this week. Snyder said he is
selling the team and has an offer
from Miami interests. but said he
would prefer selling to Buffalo area
investors to keepthe Braves in Buf—
falo.

He said he is willing to sign along
term lease if satisfactory scheduling
can be worked out. This, he said.
would bind any new owners to Buf-
falo.

Mayor Stanley Makowski of Huf-
lalo said he is trying to arrange a
meeting of the two pro teams.

' 171lris the story of how an unsung
hero has pul the glass slipper on the
heels of a true Cinderella spam
story.

Dave Lanuhan, the rail-thin
number 24 with the fluffy blonde
Afro in your Albany State basket-
ball program. is a unique story. He
has made it all the way to varsity
college basketball even though he
has never been considered good
enough to start a single bttllgame for
anyone. anywhere.

Nowadays. most college basket-
ball players are strictly “cream-of-
thc-crop“ athletes who have been ac-
tivcly recruited. pampered and, on
occzission. promised Under-thc—tublc
pots of gold by enriches whose
techniques of “ persuasion“ have

said. “I promptly concluded the

was a pair of glasses."

he said. “Then. after i quit. 1 found

So Lanahan cameto Albany State
as anonymous as an All-County
Dart-Catcher. But despite his
mediocre background. Lanahun
hustled his way onto Bob Lewis' JV
team and worked hard enough to
become the ﬁrst forward off the
bench at season's end. But. alas. you
tguessed it. he never started a game.

Lanahan‘s most recent ac-
complishment was making Sauers‘
varsity team as a sophomore. And
this season he returns as one of ﬁve
lettermen even though he scored a
meager 31 points in 18 games last
year.

“Obviously my biggest attribute is
my attitude." Lanahan said. “A lot
1 of guys thought 1 was just brown-
nosing at ﬁrst. but now all the guys
