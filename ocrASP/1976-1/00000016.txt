Aquamen Bow To RP] a

by Brian Oroi

The Albany Aquamen were crush-
ed in the jaws of RPl Wednesday
night by 73-40.

The Great Danes managed to win
only four ofthethirteen events ofthe
meet.

The brightest lining in Albany's
dark cloud was David Rubin. who
captured half of the Danc's victories.
and set a school record. Rubin's first
race of thelnight wasthc 1000 yard
Freestyle. His time was 10:44.4. leav-
ing the old record of 10:47. in his
wake. After resting just two events.
,Rubln came back to win the 200
yardt individual Medley with a time
of 2:i5.5. Rubin raced again during

the meet. this time in the 500 yard
Freestyle. His time was identical to
RPl's Hal Ehrhardt. 5:l4.7. but the

 

judge declared Ehrhttrdt the winner.

"The triple. (the three races David
Rubin swam). is very hard to do.
whether you win or not.“ said
Albany's conch Ron White. “Diivid
did very well. winning two events.
setting it school record. and just
barely losing the third event.“

Other Danes victories included
Artie Rowcnbcrg's win inthesecond
One Meter Diving contest. His point
total was 180.2. edging Rl’l's
Courtney by 3.55. The last Dane vic-
tory was brought to Albany by
Mitch Rubin. completing the' 200
yeard Butterﬂy in 2:10.l.

RPl swept all seven points in the
opening event. the 400 yard Medley
Relay. and never relinquished the
lead. The Danes challenged only

A pair of off-the-ball offensive
fouls cost the Danes heavily.
resulting in turnovers and baskets by
Tom Eggelston, sealed the verdict.

Cavanaugh led all scorers with 14
points. followed by Trevett (l3) and
Brian Bardker (10) for Albany.
Meade (l3). Bob Demyan (12) and
Bob Ulrich (12) led the hosts.

“It‘s nothing a good basket or
break won't cure." said Albany var-
sity basketball coach. Doctor
Richard Sauers. regarding the
Danes‘ l—6 record after a 5—0start.
“We just have not been hitting the
big ones. nor have we gotten any
breaks."

“The injuries and illnesses have
not helped much either. Saucrs con-
tinued. Mike (Suprunowicz) is play-
ing at about 80 percent. Audi was
just back from the ﬂu. and
Cavunaugh is still hampered a bit by
the knee. but we'll be set by Satur-

Women Hoopsters Crush Siena

by Christine Bellini

Albany State's Women's Varsity
Basketball team scored their first
victory of the season 7 l-37 at Sicna
Wednesday to even their record at
one and one.

The Danettcs lost to Skidn‘iorc.
61-35. in December.

“We were very unhappy not play-
ing on our own court." said Coach
Barbara Palm. “We were scheduled
to play at home but unfortunately.
because of a mistake. we couldn‘t get
the facilities."

The Women‘s team was asked to
go to Sienti because their scheduled
court was to be occupied by in-
trumuriils.

“We realize that Sienn wnsiit close
proximity. btit is is the principle that
counts.“ continued Palm. “We have
a facility problem because of enroll-
ment and priorities. but we think
that once in awhile we should he
considered a priority."

Despite the abrupt change in
plans. the players were informed at 3

V. ‘lrui vi. my omit

p. m. of their changed location for ll
7:30 p.m. game. and the team left
Sienti‘s court with a 16 point lead at
halftime.

Center Mary Ann (‘rotty led the
way with 10 points. Albany was con-

sidered the home team.

“We played it different opponent
this time than with Skidmore." said
Palm. “Siena hits lost some height
and speed since last year. but if we
continue to play it balanced game. i
really think we're going to gel and be
it good team."

Basically Freshmen

This year‘s team. basically it
freshman squad. consists of seven
frcsltmcit. one sophomore. two
juniors. and one senior. With only
four returnees on the team. it will
take time for the squad to gain ex-
perience. according to Palm.

“We must rely on speed and
quickness because of otir luck of
height." Pzilm said. “We have no
weak teams on our schedule; each
game we‘re out to play against good

competition."

Albany finds its stifl'cst competi-
tion against Potsdam and llnrtwick
colleges.

Albany‘s starting line-up con-
sisted of Mary Ann Crotty-ccnter.
Kutlty llnrig-l'orwnrd. Mary Ellen
Foley-forward. Nancy Bertie-guard.
and Tracy Sugihtirs-guard. High
scorers were Crotty with in points.
Sugiharti ttnd llarig with 14 points
and Sue Winthrop with l2 points.
The speed of Stigilturn and precise
shooting of Crotty and Winthrop
helped bring Albany to its first vic-
tory of the season.

“Although otir endurance wasn‘t
too good. l‘nt optimistic for the
season ahead.“ said Point. “I just
\\()Ildt.‘l' if the men‘s varsity team
would have been llSkCtl to lcnvctheir

Needless to say. the players were
very disappointed and upset."

Approximately 500 people came
yesterday to hear President Emmett
B. Fields translate Carey‘s l976-77
Executive Budget into the austere
reality that SUNYA faces in theim-
mcdiatc future. Fields. speaking at a
special open session of the Universi—
ty Senate. announced the possibility
that he will be forced to cut more
than 88 positions already indicated
by Carey.

Fields explained that the numbers
recommended by the Governor‘s
budget may prove to be misleading.

The budget suggested that
SUNYA ax 27 faculty. 28 faculty
support. and 33 other positions in
order to save an estimated “.343.-
200 per year in salaries. But. accor-
ding to Fields. the average salary
figures that Governor Carey's people
used were higher than what they are
in reality. Fields concluded that.
“there is a clear possibility that we
must eliminate more positions than
are shown [in the budget].“

UB President Cuts Oil

by Paula Rasnick

Although there has been no of-
ficial policy set. three separate ac-
tions by the president of SUNY ill
Buffalo have led students there to
believe that the university‘s ad-
ministration is ntnking an effort to
gradually take over student services
on campus. Asidet'rom moves aimed
at specific groups. an overall review
of the funding ofstudent services hits
been ordered.

Dr. Robert Kcttcr ordered the clos-
iitg of the school's Record Co-op.

 

ing down the university's activity.
the cost for students is going up." ex-
plained Fields. “The Board of
‘Trustees has not voted that increase
yet. and l'm not sure of the
magnitude ofthe levelthey will come
to."

As Fields concluded. this reﬂects
one of the crucial differences
between the SUNY system and other
state agencies: while some in-
stitutions can only take. SUNY is in
the precarious position of being able
to give back.

Fields went on to explain that the
Governor's mandate for revenue in-
creases is what will force tuition and
room to go up. He said that thesein—
creases will save the taxpayers an es-
timated $50 million.

He is mindful that there is “heavy
resistance to additional taxation."
and that “given that position in
whichthelegislatureﬁndsitself.. . .
there will be little interest in restor-
ing the cuts." Fields voiced the fer-
vent hope that the legislators will not
impose further cuts.

The (Jo-op is a student funded
record store. located in the basement
of the student tinion. This came as a
result of a complaint front a local
record dealer in Buffalo. that the Co-
op was “unfair competition." The
records tlicrc are sold tax-free. and
the outside dealers felt that this was
not fair. as tltc store is located on
land paid for by state taxpayers. The
student uprising was so great when
the store closed that Kcttcr was forc-
ed to reverse his decision. and
negotiate il compromise. The Co-op
is now open. bill was rcqttircd to ctit

Fields Hints At Further Position
Cuts As SUNYA Tightens Its Belt

“One question that may be in your
minds-—it usually is when you hear
bad neWs.“ said Fields. “is: did we get

.it worse than other people?" Fields
continued by giving his conclusions
as to how SUNYA fared in com-
parison to the other schools.

Although there appears to have
been no discrimination on the basis
of whether the institution is a Un-
iversity Center or college. Fields
mentioned that. “The campus that
seemed to catch it harder than any
other is Binghamton.“

Compared to Albany's proposed
loss of 88 positions. SUNY Buffalo
was asked to drop 133. Stony Brook
will lose 78 positions. Binghamton
86.

Another topic Fields discussed at
length was his newly-drafted Task
Force on Priorities and Resources.
This committee will serve as the
decision-making structure whose
report. due March I. l976. will
determine where personnel cuts are
to be tnade.

President Fields gave grim fiscal news to those who attended the
special University Senate meeting yesterday afternoon.

to “assess all academic and support
programs of the university; recom-
mend priority rankings for program
claims on resources; and consult and
advise the president on the develop-
ment of the university‘s operating

Student Group Funds

The administration also interfered
with the school's student pharmacy.
which was recently innovated into
the student services. Although the
mandatory student fees support the
pharmacy and paid a professional
pharmacist. Kettcr demanded that
the operation transfer its phar-
maceutical license to the university‘s
possession or close down. It was felt
that the administration feared the
possibility of a lawsuit in spite of
the pharmacist and wanted to be
tlblC to handle things its own way.
Many students felt it likelythat the
situation was comparable to that of
the Record (‘o-op. in tltnt Kctter was
giving in to lociil pressures. Students
could obtain prescribed drugs til it
cheaper rtite its long its it was they
who held the license.

YPIRG Negotiations
The most recent incident has been

President Ketter‘s involvement in
the negotiation of ti contract
between SUNY-B's Student

Association nitd NYPlRG. The two
groups hat/c been working out the
contract since the summer.
Although SA does have the right to
negotiate. all its dealing must go
tltroiigh the administration. Ketter
refused to accept the NY PIRG con-
tract. Mentbers of NYl’lRO feeltluit
this was done because Kctter
believes that the organisation is too
political. and of little or ito
educational benefit to the students.
Requiring NYPIRG to be billed
through the administration would
give the university full control over
NYPlRG's funds.

The Student' Association at
SUNY-B is organizing student
resistance to the administration‘s
crackdown. Several steps are being
taken. Michelle Smith ofthe Student
Association explained that Kettcr is
not trying to shut down student ser-
vices. btit rat her take them over. She
said Buffalo‘s primary objective is to
uitify all student groups and show
that they would rather close uptltan

allow the administration to control
them. “The idea is to convince the
geology club that they're a student
service...Thc university wants us to
hand over services that we put our
moitcy into and we won‘t." Site con-
tinued by saying that Kctter could
not take it closing down because he
would lose a lot of money.
Biggest Obstacle

Smith feels that the biggest
obstacle istltat students don‘t know
enough about student Services. who
ollci's them and wlterc they come
front. Consequently. the SA zit Buf-
liilo is publishing a "White Paper"
oit student services that will come
otit in mid-February. SUNYJJ‘s
SA has also orgnitilcd it mass
meeting of all involved with student
services to plan some kind of
strategyto work with against tltetid-
ministration.

There has been no official state-
ment made by tltc univcrrity ofthe-st-
incidents. and no administrator
could be contacted for continent
Sludeiits seem to be having difficult
time figuring out what the
president's motivations are. Many
feel that the problem stcnts from the
Buffalo community‘s attitude
toward the students. and Kcttcr's
relationship to the contntunity.
Kettcr serves on the Board of Direc-
tors of Murine Midland Bank and
has various other city interests.

Smith explained that relations
between the students and the com-
niunity hiivc been strained ever since
the riots in 1970. “Now tltc general
attitude is that students aren't
capable of being ittvolvcd in these
things...'l'hc community supports
ltim (Kctter) when he puts down the
students." Smith also attributed
some of Kctter‘s actions to the poor
economic situation in both the state
and the city. Both the university and
local business are nervous and look-
ing for money. Smith remarked. “If'
these people can hurt Ketter he‘ll be
responsive to them."

budget for 1975-76.“
Fields asked the committee to
keep three principles in mind as they

weigh the enormous amount of data '

in this short time period: “First the
preservation and nurturing ofthose
programs which are essential and
central to a university; second. the
preservation of quality; and third the
preservation and nurturing ofthose
programs that uniquely address our
immediate environment—the State
Capital District of New York."

At the conclusion ‘of this remarks.
Fields faced questioning by some of
the faculty members.

Professor TliCOdOI‘C P. Wright of
the Political Science department
stated that the departments of many
members of last year‘s Select Com-
mittee on Priorities suffered the
least. in light of this. he asked how
tltc findings of this new committee
could possibly be viewed without a
high degree of cynicism.

Fields restated his faith in the
competence of the force‘s members.
telling Wright that they were drawn
front n widc cross sectioit of uni versi-
ty advisory committees.

Peter Cocks. formerly ofthe Allen
Center a victim ofthe last round of
budget cuts «asked if Fields sees any
contradictions in the principles the
committee was being asked to keep
in mind. He wanted to knowifit was
possible for people who were trying
to please the legislators with its
choice of priorities could possibly be
sensitive to the other areas of
academic importance.

Fields said it is highly probable
that a program would be rated high-
ly on one scale and low on another
and added that. “We will do the best
with tltc little time we‘ve got.“
