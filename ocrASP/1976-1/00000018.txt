’ one of the ﬁndings'rhirt Professor

 

Janie: «Nelson's Sociology 223‘
(Research Methods) class came up

with last semester when they decided
to do osrudy ofocodcmlc cheating at

SUN YA. The following I: a report of
that study. - _

A random sample of 400 un-
dergraduate and non-matriculated
students was obtained from the com-
puter center and the registrar. A
total of l89 interviews were com-
pleted. Students without phone
numbers and local addresses Were
underrepresented in the completed
interviews.

The interview was designed to
guarantee the respondent's
anonymity and to facilitate the
delicate task of asking if the respon-
dent cheated on examinations. The
interview was divided intotwo pans
First, the student interviewer asked

 
 

choice exams had; the ‘ 
cheating rate (2| percent) whereas
essay (IO percent) and math type
problem exams (I I percent) had the
lowest rates.

This suggests that the differences
in cheating rates across divisions
might be due to the type of exams
given by the divisions. A ' brief
analysis of the data showed that con-
trolling for exam type does not alter
the ﬁndings. In other words. if the
same type of exams were given in all
divisions, thentbe Physical Sciences
and the Humanities would still have
significantly lower cheating rates
than the Social Sciences and
Business.

Students were also 'asked to rate
their instructor from “among the
best I've ever had" to “among the
worst I‘ve ever had." Generally. as
the rating of the instructor increased,
the amount of cheating decreased.

dent‘rcad these questions to himself,
Wed“ themﬂnd seaﬂ'fbem
(along with the earlier questions) in
an anvelope. nThis‘ "envelope was
either mailed or band-delivered to
the instructor of the course.

The questions on cheating
behavior asked the respondent if he
had cheated on his last hourly exam.
This was repeated for up to four
courses. (If the respondent took
more than four courses. a random
technique was used tolimitthe inter-
view to just four.) Of those who had
taken at least one hourly exam, thir-
ty percent admitted to having
cheated at least once. Because the
survey did not cover morethan four
courses. and because it asked only
about each course's last hourly
exam. the real percent is probably
somewhat higher.

The type of cheating was also
recorded. Of those who cheated, 73
percent looked at another student‘s
paper; II percent had illegal access
to the exam; 9 percent cheated in
some unknown way (i.e., the method
was not preceded); 6 percent used
crib sheets; and only I percent had
someone. take the exam for them.

Cheating was also broken down
by classes. The data showed that
about l5 percent of the students in
any class cheated on the last exam.
Combined with the type of cheating
information above,thissuggeststhat
in the “average” class of l003tudents
on the last hourlyexam, I I looked at
someone clsc‘s paper and 4 cheated
in another manner.

Cheating within class was broken
down by type of course. type of exam
and “type” of instructor. The highest
rate of cheating occurred in the
Business School (2| percent) and in
the Division of Social Sciences (18
percent). The lowest rates occurred

Teachers who were rated among the
best had 8 percent cheating in their
last exams, whereas those rated
among the worst had 23 percent.

.,;TsStudents were also asked to es-
timate the chanceE‘of being caught
cheating on their last exam. As the
perceived chance of being caught in-
creased. the percent of students
cheating decreased. Of those who

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

* 'felt they certainlyu'would be

caught. 22 percent ‘admitted
cheating. The percent' cheating
decreased to I7. l4, ll and'2 percent
as the perpeived chance of being
caught increased. ' _

The perceived reaction of the in-
structor to cheating was also
measured. The instructor‘s possible
responses to catching someone
cheating were coded from “ignore
the cheating" to "take the student to
the dean for discipline." The data
showed that cheating on exams was
not related to the student‘s percep-
tion of what the instructor would do
if he caught someone cheating.

The class also hypothesized that
class size and importance of the

exam would be related to cheating.

Neither of these ideas worked out.
The data showed that thelowest rate
of cheating occurred in classes hav-
ing 46 to 60 students. It was higherin
both smaller and larger classes. The
amount of cheating did not vary by
how much the exam affected the
ﬁnal grade either.

The study also examined a
number of individual variables as
causes or correlates of cheating. This
analysis showed that males cheated
about twice as much as females; that
students living on campus cheated
about the same as those living off
campus; that students with paying
jobs cheated about the same as those
without jobs; that students who
cheated perceived more cheating in
their classes than did those who did
not cheat; and that attitudes about
cheating were closely related to ac-
tual cheating.

These last twa ﬁndings suggest
that a general norm against cheating
exists on campus. If students did not
consider cheating to be somesprt of
normative violation then one would
expect cheatiﬁtg‘i‘ngitudes and
behavior to benindepen'dcnt of each
other. Instead, it looks like students
believe cheating is basically wrong,

seem to try to establish support for

r A woman- named Irene IS. .Lore
recently applied for a trainee posi-

tion at New York's Chase Manhat-
tan Bank. ‘

A few days later, she received two
letters in the mail fromthe bank, one
addressed to “Miss I. R. Lore," and
the other to “Mr. LS. Lore." The
“Miss Lore” letter sadly informed

. her that there were no available

positions.

However, the letter to “Mr. Lore"
was happy to announce that inter-
views for a possible job could be
arranged.

As a result. “Ms. Lore." along
with nine other women, is suing
Chase Manhattan on charges of sex
discrimination.

THE CLAWS

In the wake of the movie "Jaws,"
the Wilderness Society has asked the
U.S. Forest Service to halt theﬁlm-
ing of another fright movie, ten-
tatively titled “Claws.”

Clifton Merritt of the Wilderness
Society says that a movie company
on location in Montana plans to do a
ﬁlm about u rampaging grizzly bear
that claws campers to death.

According to Merritt. the ﬁlm will
“distort the facts about this noble
animal.“ perhaps turning popular
opinion against its survival.

The Wilderness Society points out
that a baby whale that was accident-
ly benched in Florida recently, was
brutally nttnckcd and stabbrd to
death by a mob that thought the
whole was a shark.

The Mexican High Court last
week, in a 3 to 2 decision. ruled that
Mexican Police have illegally
searched and detained hundreds of
foreigners on drug charges.

The court ruled that police have
no right to searchthe belongings of a
foreigner if that person merely
changes planes in Mexico City or is
aboard an airline that lands in Mex-
ico for refueling purposes.“

There are nearly 600 Americans in
Mexican jails on a variety'of drug
charges—and records indicate that a
majority of them were arrested at the
Mexico City Airport.

American critics—~ch by Califor-
nia Congressman Pete Stark—
contend that Henry Kissinger and
the U.S. State Department have
done virtually nothingto secure their
release.

Three major labor organizations

The three unions. The American

and have concluded that no legal or
