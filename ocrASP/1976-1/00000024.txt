continued from page sixteen

“But Dave Landry picked up the
slack by ﬁnally playing basketball
the way he‘s capable of playingevery
night." his coach said afterward.

Landry. a freshman from nearby
Cohoes. hit seven of 13 from the
ﬂoor. twa of three from the line.
pulled down 12 rebounds and re-
jccted two shots in his ﬁnest effort in
an Albany uniform.

“Everything came together for me
tonight.“ Landry said after the game.

But the way the game begun for
Albany. you would have thought
Royal would not need Landry or
anyone else to help himself beat
Oneonta singic-handedly. Royal hit
nine of his team‘s ﬁrst ll points and
assisted on the only basket he didn‘t
SCDI‘C.

“Winston did his thing out there
tonight like he always does." Austin
said later. “He is one very steady
player.‘f

Royal led Albany with 24 points,
eight for I8 front the ﬁeld. perfect on
eight free throw attempts. had six
assists and four steals and also sold
popcorn during time-outs.

But Winston did require. and

received, slot of help from his
friends. Cal little cdtne oil' the
bench to hit two‘straight jumpers to
give Albany'seven-point advantages,
l7-l0 and 2l-I4. at the 7:25 mark of
the ﬁrst half. Those leads matched
Albany‘s largest in the ﬁrst half.
And it was two more reserves,
Mike Voliton and John Grabowski.
who rattled the Pups from a 30-27
deﬁcit in the hall‘s ﬁnal minute with
six points between themselves to
send Albany ahead 33—27 at inter-
mission.

Albany never trailed from that
point.

“Mike and John got us running
and when we run we were the better
team out there." Austin said. “They
[Oneonta] didn't play all that great
defense and we were able to take ad-
vantage of certain situations."

The Pups outscored Oneonta l4—6
to lead 47-36 at the 6:52 mark ofthe
second half before Landry and
Oneonta‘s Greg Kuntz did their im-
pression of George Foreman and
Ron Lylc. The decision went to Lan~
dry but so did two technical fouls.
The ﬁght broke State‘s momentum
temporarily.

Ross Unleashed
About the same point in time
Oneonta unleashed Dave Ross. who
was outstanding. Ross, who ended
the game with 33 points (M for 20

shooting). was the only Oneonta,

player who scored in the last ﬁve
minutes. He hit six consecutive
jumpers and added a free throw for
an incredible I3 straight points.

But Ross‘ effort fell short thanks
to a tenacious Albany defense which
f orccd many turnovers by Ross‘
teammates. And Winston Royal was
usually the beneﬁciary of those
Oneonta mistakes. Royal‘s last
basket. is double-pump spectacular
off a feed from BuddyWicIinski,gave
the Pups their largest lead of the
night at the buzzer.

Albany shot 42% from the floor
on 3| for 7i shooting, while Oneonta
hit 40%, making 28 of 69.

The Pups hit l7 of 25 fromthe free
throw line. while Oneonta managed
to hit only 50%. II for 22.

The medical report on Staton
Winston is good. The Pups' leading
pointmaker and rebounder will
return to action in two weeks. which
coincidentally, is the same night
Siena comes to town.

Tonight at 6:30 Albany‘s JVs face
always-tough Union College.
