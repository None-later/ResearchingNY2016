34-0 and defeated Amherst for ﬁrst
place 28-10. Amherst ﬁnished se-

cond. beating Albany 40-6. and
Southern Connecticut 2l-9. and
Southern Connecticut beat Albany
for a third place finish by a 36-7

count.

The Colgate match saw the

“young and inexperienced" Danes
unable to win a single weight class.
The Danes suffered three pins and
lost two more matches on forfeits.

Trevett left the court after instant
freeze was applied to ltis wrist to stop

unhcurttble. But I wanted to get back
in the game so I told Doc [Couch
Sauers] to pttt me in.“

win it. but Cesare's hurried shot
from the corner hit the rim and sent
the game into overtime.

In the extra session. it was “Mr.
Fantastic“ once more: Steve
Blackmon. who rosetothe occasion.
Fouled by Trevett. he sunk bothfree
throws to give his team its first lead

   

 

in twentyminutes—after only six

seconds had expired in overtime. But
Cesare‘s seven-foot " pop. and

the hosts on top again.

Blackmon converted an offensive

For Albany varsity coach Doctor

Sauers explained it was “very dis-

As for the team‘s'perfnrmance so
