BULLETIN: Trevett Breaks Wrist

Garijrevett. Albany State's all-
time leading assist leader and
playmaker on this year‘s Great Dane

played the last ten minutes of Satur-
day's spectacular win over Oneonta
State with a broken wrist.

break which will keep Trevett out of

be in more than one place. if this is
true. it might beten weeks(longafter
this season is over) before Gary

Pups Down Oneonta, 7 9-67 ,
Despite Two-Player Loss

by Michael Smith

Judging from the outstanding
contributions from several reserves.
who‘were called up to duty because
of injuries to several frontline per-
sonnel. the National Guard really
ought to think about having the
Albany State JV basketball team do
its recruiting.

Bill Austin's Pups. a real medical
dictionary in uniform. piled uptwo
more serious injuries Saturday night
to go along with the loss of star
Staton Winston. who earlier this

week suffered two broken fingers. '

But thanks to Dave Landry‘s
career-high l6 points. great bench
play from John Grabowrki and Col
Battle. plus another irrepressible
performance by smooth Winston
Royal. Albany had enough in
reserve to hold off Oneonta State.

important game of the young season.

The win left the Danes in a ﬂat-

footed tie with the Red Dragons in

the conference with identical 4-l«
records. and a 7-6 mark overall.

“The ball was supposed to go to
[Bob] Audi at the high post.” said
Cesare of the game-winning play.
“But i ended up withit and drovethe
middle looking for a foul. ljust got
lucky."

But to a great extent so was the
whole Danes team. Only seconds
earlier. Oneonta had a chance to
take the lead when junior guard
Kevin Croutier. who shoots 44 per
cent from the line. stood at the foul
line in a one-and-one situation and
the score knotted. His shot bounded
off the back rim and was pulled
down by the Danes’ Barry
Cavanaugh—giving the. hosts
possession with 25 seconds left. and‘
Albany called for time-out.

The excitement was not conﬁned
to the extra session. in fact. the

widest margin held by either'tenm ‘

the entire game was four points. The
scoring “battle” waged by Oneonta‘s
Steve Blackmon (22 points) and
Cavanaugh (20 points). only added
to the suspense.

Both teams began rather sluggish-
ly. Blackmon recorded the first two
points of the game via foul shots. but
the ﬁrst basket was not made until
Carl Mabry‘s jumper gave Oneonta
a 4-0 lead at' l5:2l of the ﬁrst half.
Cavanaugh sunk two free throws
seconds later to put the hosts on the
board. before Gary Trevett garnered
the ﬁrst Dane bucket with seven
minutes gone.

The lack of scoring on both sides
was due partially to the aggressive
man~to—man and zone defenses
employed and partially to cold
shooting. The Red Dragons held on
to their slim lead until a twisting
drive by Trevctt knotted the score at
ten midway through the half. The
score was tied twicc more before
Oneonta opened up a four-point
lead on a fast break bucket by
Blackmon and a jumper from the
corner by John Minicucci. .

Audi then converted an offensive
rebound but Oneonta‘s Ken Ford
retaliated with a driving layup to
give the visitors a 20- I6 lead with ﬁve

Both teams proceeded to miss good

found Cavnnaugh alone underneath
for an easy layup. and the Danes

undergraduate students may once
again have to fulﬁll academic dis-

Last November. the University
Senate Program Evaluation Com-

the ll.A. and BS degrees to
promote a more coherent liberal

The curricular reforms adopted

FSA Student Control Threatened

by Bob Wong

The SUNY Board of Trustees
recently approved a new set of FSA
guidelines which could effectively
but a student majority on the
Faculty-Student Association Board
of Directors.

These new guidelines. which
became effective December [7. I975.
may jeopardize the student control
of SUNYA‘S FSA Board . and the
position ofits newly-elected student
president. Stu Klein.

However, student control need
not end immediately because of the
guidelines.

“They will not affect us." says Stu
Klein. who last month became the
ﬁrst student president in the cor-
poration's history. “We're governed
by the Not-For- Proﬁt laws unless we
have a contract with the state."

SA Lawyer Paul Kietzman agrees.
saying that FSA is not a state agency
so the State Education Department
has no control. He does concede
ltowevet that the “state can cltoose to
do business elsewhere."

FSA General Manager E. Norbert
Zahm says that Klein is “partly
right" about being independent of
the guidelines. FSA is incorporated
as u Not-For-Proﬁt organization.
says Zahm. but “in order to do
business FSA has to sign a contract."

The guidelines state that. “No
single constituency shall have more
than 50 percent of the board

membership nor shall the student
constituency htth less than one-
third the membership ofthe board."

Though they were originally on
the agenda for the Trustees‘ October
meeting, the guidelines were not
acted upon until many schools were
on recess. For this reason. malty
FSA‘s did not begin action until
recently.

According to Klein the Trustees
are allowing a “compliance period"
for FSA boards. Zahm. however.
wants compliance immediately.

David Coync. Chairperson of
Central Council. says that FSA will
be given enough time to “seek
clariﬁcation" of the guidelines. ad-
dingthat it will probably take along
tintc.

Zahm believes that FSA will be
given enough time to “get our house
in shape based on the guidelines." He
adds that it will take the membership
of FSA was well as the board to
“change the FSA by~laws to con-
form with the guidelines."

This procedure is expected totake
about two weeks becausethe by-l‘aws
state that any changes must be
proceeded by a ten-day notice.

Stu Klein became FSA president
after students instituted FSA by-luw
changes that enabled tltetn to main-
lain a student member majority. it
was this majority that ousted John
Hartley. SUNYA Vice-President of
Management and Planning and

allowed Klein to be elected.

Klein is confident that the new
guidelines, if instituted into the by-
laws. will not affect his position as
president. Says Klein. “l have a good
relationship with both students and
administration."

SUNY Board of Trustees Unchanged
As Higher Ed Committee "Stalls Bill

by Ed Maser

The State Legislature's _Com-
mittce on Higher Education stalled
suggested changes in faculty and stu-
dent membership on the SUNY
Board of Trustees Tuesday by sen-
ding the Trustees‘ bill back to com-
mittee.

The proposed bill would add a
faculty member to the Board and
shift the selection of student
members from students themselves
to the Governor.

One assemblyman said he couldn‘t
see the reason for any faculty
representation ontlte Board. Hesaid
faculty have their own employee
organiration to look after their in-
terests. According to him. this dual
representation would be a violation
of the Taylor law.

SASU observers were surprised
and dismayed at the Trustees‘
legislation. SASU legislative Direc'
tor Joel Packer said. “Student

membership was taken care of in the
last session of legislature when we
(SASU) placed student-picked
members on the Board. Said SASU
Legislature Director Joel Packer.
"We're going to recommend that the
student section of the bill be
deleted.“

At a meeting of the Commerce
Committee that same day. the age of
students allowed on FSA Boards
was lowered from 21 to is years.

Other Matters

In other matters. SASU backed a
proposal which would allow the use
by optometrists of drugs formerly
restricted to opthalmologists. SASU
support stems from the fact that
SUNY has a School ofOptometryin
New York. A measure to ease the
observance of holy days of obliga~
tion by devout students was passed
unanimously by the Committee on
Higher Education.

in a discussion with contmittee

members. Chairman Irwin Landes
and a visiting SUNY budget director
spoke on the tightness on funds fac-
ing the university system. Chariman
Landis asked members to think up
not only requests for fund restora-
tion but also ideas for alternative
cutbacks.
