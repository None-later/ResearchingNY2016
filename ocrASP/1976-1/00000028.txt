‘  1 line medicalsebools'inthe
past three years has rapid behind
national and state averap. ,
Intl913. SUNYA matched the
national average of all four-year in-
stitutions when 35 percent of our
pro-med students were successful in
getting into medical school. In I974
only 34 percent of SUNYA's prt.~
med students got into medical
school. as compared to the 38 per-
cent statewide and 35 percent
nationally. ln I975, only 33 percent
of SUNYA's pre~meds were
accepted, judging from the survey

responses of. 82 applicants. This
compares with 38 percent out of
other colleges statewide and 36 per-
cent nationally.

A more sobering condition is that
the mean cumulative average of
SUNYA students accepted into
medical school is consistently higher
than the cum necessary for accep-
tance on the national average.

Faculty Prawns

conllnued from page three
strenﬁh of the faculty. It is feared
that this may have a derogatory
effect on translating Field’s
guidelines.

One professor who does not agree
with this is Phil Tompkins of the
Department of Rhetoric and Com-
munication. He said, “I have con-
siderable conﬁdence in the Presiden-
tial Task Force. They have a terrible
job, but it is a well-balanced Task
Force representing the coucils and
committees of the senate. Some of
the committee members have been
on committees that have been work-
ing all year."

In regard to the total situation,
Tomkim remarked, “it is grim,
depressing...and discouraging, but I
don‘tsee much we can do about it ex-
cept take the cuts in as intelligent a
manner as possible."

So, with mixed thoughts, all un-
pleasant. the SUNY faculty awaits
the decisions of the Presidential
Task Force. Fields announced if
time permits reports of the Force's
activities will be circulated.

SUNYA pre-dental students have.
seen some encouraging

developments lately. After 54 per-
cent of SUNYA’s pre-dentai
students were accepted into dental
school in l973, the ax fell. Only 29
percent gained acceptance in I974.
Fortunately. things changed in 1975
when l5 of SUNYA‘s 34 applicants
got into dental school.

Pre-med students who are
residents of New York State labor
under a disadvantage. New York
leads the nation in numbers of
students seekina admission to
medical schools. And second
only to California, it has the

highest nuaiber‘ofnsedical schools.
Howevertﬁew" York does not
restrict cut-oMate students from
applying to New York medical

schools. Tlﬁs is in marked contrast‘
to other states which favor students,
who are residents of their own state
when making med school ad--

missions decisions.

SUNYA has made some progress
the past few years toward attaining
recognition as a top quality
educational institution, which will
make it easier in the future for pre-
med and dental students to gain
acceptances. Now, with
everymedical school application sent

SUNYA facilities and academic
credentials.

JANUARY 30, 1976

by Lorraine Chun

“It‘s not a shameful thing to be a
lobbyist," says Lenore Gittis. a
lawyer from the Legal Aid .Society.
Contrary to popular belief, a lob-
byist is not an evil person who
harnesses a legislator. But, someone
might ask. what is a lobbyist?

Gittis‘ deﬁnition is: a person that
tries to affect the legislation that
affects his constituency.

A lobbyist can be a source of in-
formation for the legislator, says
Gittis. 'Too often, a legislator is so
busy that he cannot be up-to-datc on
every bill that is introduced. As a
result he sometimes votes without
the knowledge of the pro and con
issues of a bill.

This is where the lobbyist steps in.
Whether it be in the lobby of the
legislature building —hcnce the
word “lobbyist“— or in a
lcgislator's office, the lobbyist can
present his clients’ reasons for why
or why not a bill is needed.

Lobbyists can represent anything
from banks, corporations, or labor

consumer interest groups.

The legal Aid Society is one
group that makes use of lobbyists in
Albany. In general, the Legal Aid
Society is a program that offers
representation to poor people who
can't afford to pay for legal
assistance.

Legal Aid was originally concern- v

cd solely with welfare recipients.
They have extended their services to
others. Their‘ objectives have ex-
panded to seeking legislation
favorable to the poor. The role of the
lobbyist who represents Legal Aid
would be concerned with laws affec-
ting, for example, the landlord-
tenant situation, graduated income
tax, etc.

Gittis became interested in lob-
bying while working as a trial
lawyer. She once represented
Educational Handicap. a school for
the deaf. The school was over-
crowded, and it was unhealthy for
the students who had special
problems: wires from their specially
equipped hearing aids were getting

The school was suing New York
City for not giving them sufficient
funds. Gittis won the case, and she
says it was her introduction to lob-
bying because she got involved in
trying to work through the city
budget process to get money to open
another school.

She was so attracted to the art of
lobbying that she lobbied for Legal
Aid from l973-l975 in thejuvenile
rights division. The Legal Aid Socie-
ty is divided into three divisions:
juvenile rights division. which can
cerns children under sixteen years of
age; criminal division; and the civil

courts division.

This year. Gittis is the director for
all three divisions. Ms. Gittis is really
interested in the legislative process.

A Iobbyist‘sjob can be hectic. Git-
tis‘ was of lobbying is to go to a
legislator‘s ofﬁce and talk. If she
can‘t do that. she tries to get them
before or after a session. The lob-
byist must be up to date on things.
They must attend public hearings
and check out the proposed bills.

Since Gittis is the only lobbyist in
Albany representing the Legal Aid
Society. things are always jumping
for her and her secretary.
