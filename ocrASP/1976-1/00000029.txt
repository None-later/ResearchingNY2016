Fielsh said. ‘lgawait the conclusion -

see anything: happening suddetdy '

here;  for the debate itself.”

‘ - Fielﬁ doesn't advocate the use d
distribution requirements per se. in-
stead, he supports what he calls the
“breadth principle in the bac-
calaureate. if it's 'meant to produce
the educated manor woman.”

Fields believes that a liberal lear-
ning. orijnates by, “discovering
doors opening that you didn't know

» were there. . .we do have an
obligation to open doors to un-
derstanding." 7

When asked if hethought students
would be ‘_ willing to do that
themselves. Fields replied, “Well, I
don't know. I'm sure many are —
maybe all of them."

He went on to say, “i favor
something like the distribution re-
quirements. but my advocacy is
limited by a realization that we're
talking about a device. My real belief
is that the problem’is so big that
about the onlything that i can really
advocate is that the faculty and stu-
dent body keep alive the question.
what is aliberallyeducated person?"

According to Fields, “The idea of
distribution can be met in a great
variety of ways. The bigissue is. how
do you get people to seek breadth
and achieve some of it in a waythat
reconciles comfortably with the idea
of free choice— and there‘s going
to be some tension there.”

Recently, SA President Andy
Bauman expressed some of that ten-
sion when he addressed Fields about
the distribution requirements.
Bauman told Fields that he helie‘ :d
the majority Of the student body is
satisfied with the present system and
they would become upset at the
thought of giving it up.

Fields said he could understand
the students‘ position but. “at the
same time it makes me a little un-
easy. Are students themselves get-
ting conservative so that they don't
want to look at anything new?“ Ask-
ed Fields, “Rampant free choice
does raise the clear possibility that
students will be sharply pointed and
not well rounded." When asked if he
thinks that istrue at SUNYA. Fields
replied. “i think maybe it is."

Six years ago the University
Senate thought otherwise. The l970
proposal that was responsible for
eliminating SUNYA‘s distribution
requirements was passed with the
ideathat it would “hearaid the begin-
ning of new educational patterns in
titis university."

An April 24, l970 ASP article
read. “[The] Senate's feeling was that
it is both morally wrong and
'wasteful to require students to take
cdurses that they have no interest
in . . . despite efforts by professors
to whip students with the grade . .

The concept Of the ‘wcil-rounded
man' was rejected as well."

Present Senate Chairman
Tompkins feels that distribution re-
quirements may in fact improve the
quality of education at SUNYA. but
he has a broader theory of why the

HORNY DOLLS

A doll Of Archie Bunker’s grand-

than Archie himself.

The doll, named “Joey” after the
newly-born T..V. grandson. will be

Chicago toy-maker Anton lsaacson
says that “Joey's” appearance marks
the ﬁrst time ever that a mass-
produced doll has come fully

lsaarson predicts that if “Joey”
catches on, dolls which are fully en-
dowed with sex parts may become a
wave of the future.

. The technique involved is known
scientifically as “radio-immune

radioactively-tagged marijuana with
antibodies obtained from a goat —
and then comparing the results with
a blood sample obtained from a user.

The new test is considered highly

SUNDOWN

Three Rice University scientists

are out with the bizarre theorythat a
small “black hole” may be embedded
in the center of the Sun. '

A black hole is an incredibly dense
body of matter whose particles have
undergone molecular collapse. A
black hole is so dense that one the
size of a grain of sand would weigh
millions of tons.

Three astrophysicists — Donald
Clayton. Michael Newman and Ray-
mond Talbot — say that recent ex-
periments have discovered that the
Sun is not giving Off as many
neutrinos as would be expected in a
normal solar reaction. The reason
for this lack of neutrinos has not
been explained by conventional
science.

The three scientists, however. say
that a black hole located at the very
center of the sun would explain the
discrepancy in neutrino emissions.

The scientists suggest that the
black hole is nowjust a few inches
across. but that it is slowly growing
larger as it absorbs matter from the
Sun itself.

Presumably. one day the black
hole will collapse and absorb the en-
tire Sun and then. after that. the
Earth.

LASER FAZE
The United States Army has
reportedly developed a laser weapon
capable of slicing the wings off an
enemy airplane from a distance of up
to three miles.

Joncs's All the World Airmft. the
authoritative publication on
weapons. recently reported that the
Soviet Union and the United States ,
are involved in 'a highly-secret and
costly race to developlaser weapons.
Janes's. howwer, gave no details
about the lasers already in existence.

Recon Magazine says the U.S.
Navy is perfecting a laser weapon
that can be carried aboard ships.
while the Air Force is attempting to
mount the death ray devices in
supersonic aircraft.

SEX-ED ABORTED

A high school sex education
program in Felton. California. has
been suspended after parents com-
plained that one of the teachers had
boasted to students about
decorating his Christmas tree with
male contraceptives.

Other critics charged that the
same teacher allegedly inﬂated a

' rubber condom like a balloon and
then let it ﬂy about the classroom.
