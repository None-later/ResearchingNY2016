by Ellen M.‘White 1: |

“How do you expect me to write
when l have to feed the damn card
reader?“ shc snappcd. “Don‘t you
want me to write? Didn‘t we come
here so I could write? And what do
you have me do 7 feed your reader.
a lousy opcralor'sjob. Well I work a
lousy job all day long and I don‘t
want to do one now."

Bent over the keyboard of his
CRT, Jim hid his smile and did not
answer. He had heard this speech
before. From their past fights he
knew that her voice was loud and
harsh; but here. suprcssed by the
overwhelming noise, Sarah. his
wife sounded almost pleasant.

The room was unusually noisy.
Narrow and low ccilingcd. it was lin-
cd with machines. Whirring tapes.
kcypunchcs, a roaring disk, clatter-
ing rattling printers and readers
packed the room with an insistent
rage. A large air conditioner, which
was necessary to keep the machines
from overheating, rushed the air.
fluttering the calendars. stray output
and other papers as if some violent
storm was contained within the
walls.

Sarah, who had been here time
after time. was still astonished by it
all. Everything happened at a
superhuman rate information
leaped from the printer thrcc hun-
dred lines it minute; the reader suck-
cd in. stored. and cxpcllcd nine, ten,
maybe more cards pcr'sccond. Ex-
cept for the reader, Sarah un-
derstood nothing of this room. As
far as she was concerned. it was all
beyond her hand and mind. Usually
the atmosphere caused her to
become almost defensive. to pull all
of her facilities into one focus. Here.
she found she could concentrate best
when she made up her mind loll. But
today. instcud of threatening her
into production. Computer
Applications had overwhelmed her.

She stood before the reader
feeding stack after stack of cards.
Druggcd by the regular rattle of
transmission.shcfcllloodulltocvcn
remember the poem that had been so
full within her when she had entered
the room. The sounds. the rushing
air was like ti stormy sea. and she. a
lucklcss crab, was caught in the un-
dcnow. Wuvc uftcr smashing wavc
drove her down. stripped ltcr,
crushing to salty sund her fragile
shell of words and images.

Jim also foundthc room hypnotic.
The noise of his projects in progress
spurred him to produce more. This
room was hill domain. he loved to
come here late at night. when no one

was here but himself and his wife.

and he was glad that she could take
some part in his working life, the
most important part of hislifc. After
several years in the ﬁeld. computers
still fascinated him. Coming in late
at night. he could take care ofthc un-
intcrcstlng phases of his work, which
allowed himto spend morctime with
the programming problems. his real
love. The range of this work was to
take two unrcal worlds. the worlds of
problem and potentiality, and to
make out of them an actuality. a
practical result. Ht: loved to pit the

limitations of his mind against the
limitations of the machine. tofit the /

pu'ulc of language to that of cir-
cuitry. To him. his work was a cons-
tant awakening, growth. and reﬁne-
ment.

“You know I haven‘t written
anything since we've been married,"
Sarah burst in again. “It's been a
year w one year and not one decent
poem, not one paragraph. You know
that I can write.“ she pleaded. "You
know why I'm not writing. You
know. Jim."

He supposed that he did. But what
could he say to her? He remembered
when he ﬁrst knew her. she papcrcd
her bedroom door with the poems
she had published.Now, she posted
up rejection slips. He didn't under-
stand why she bothered to send out
the old poems. Even she had said
that they wore no good. They hadn‘t
been published in the pest. why
would anybody want them now?“To
touch me humility." was her response
to his questions. He wondered how
close to martyrdom such humility
would lead her.

But her poetry was good; at least.
he, who did not have a lush: for such
found her poems beautiful,joyous,

but most important. puzzles intheir
own right. Even Sarah, usually so
down on herself said that they were
promising. But it was till quite true,

 

   
 
 
 
   
 
 

  

she hadn‘t ﬁnished anything in a
long time.

“And how do you expect me to
write?" Her voice rose over the
muchincs once more. "I work all day,
work I hate. I come home and I‘m
free. Free, Free —~ and what do I do.
cook. clean. wash the dishes, do the
laundry. It‘s always too late. Or we
skip everything to come here. Then
you make me work. I hardly have
time to read the paper much less
write a line.“

She paused a minute. Jim did not
answer so she began again: “And not
only don't I have the time, but what
if I did? What do I have to write
about? The dishes. your dirty un-
derwear, riding the bus in the mor-
ning'r'

He reﬂected that she had once
written an excellent poem about an
early morning bus ride. Perhaps she
remembered it too. as suddenly she
burst into tears. She was getting
close, he thought. maybe this time
she'd get it.

Sobbing, she continucdtofecd the
reader.

“Jim. I can‘t go on like this. I have
to have my own life. You have yours.
even if it‘s only as narrow as this
room. I have nothing. I am nothing."

She fed inthc last stack ofcards. It
was the second time this weckthat he
had heard the speech. 0n the table
behind her he could see her
notebook. opened to a page covered

“WHAT DO I HfN€ TO WRITE ABOUT?
THE Dl§H€$ YOUR DIRTY UND€RW€AR. RIDII‘lG TH€ BUT IN THE MORNING?"

with circles as if she were doing a
handwriting exercise.

Though the reader was finally
empty. she continued to stand before
it dumbly. The air. the noise of the
other machines pressed around her,
still overpowering her.

She picked up the notebook and
ran into the other room. shuttingthe
door ﬁercely. Takinga pen. she ﬁrm-
ly blacked over the row of zeros and
underneath. began to write: oh my
sucking. spitting child./ full and
moving, always /always. lain void...

Jim entered. “Sarah. are you
OK?" She nodded and continued to
write: the rattle is your comfort and
my dirgc . . .

“Sarah, look. their system went
down in the middle of the reading.
Yourjob bounced. Would you mind
doing it again?"

She looked up ﬁnally. "Yes, I'm
busy." He smiled and lefttheroom.
