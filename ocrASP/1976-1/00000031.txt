' Frets  Friday

by Spence Ragglo

Start to talk about rock guitarists,
and it doesn't matter if it‘s Jeff Beck,
Joe Walsh or Eric Clapton —
someone will always jump up and
proclaim one of them to be the
greatest musician to put his ﬁngers
to the frets. '

Peter Frampton is no exception.
He has his share of fanatical ad-
mirers, and with good reason.

 

Peter Framplon will perform at the
Palace one week from tonight.

Frempton is a consistent and inven-
tive guitarist, and eventhough helcft
Humble Pic to begin a solo career,
Frampton is nothing if not a good
band musician. .

As a composer, Frampton has a
talent for melody. The result has
been several singles which achieved
modest airplay -— the latest and best
of these being “Show Me The Way."
He is interested in the song, in the
music. His guitar plays a dominant
role, not the only role. 0n vinyl, at
least, Frampton stays away f romthc
more esoteric approaches to the
guitar of, say, Jeff Beck.

Framplon in concert, though, is
just as much showman-virtuoso as
anyone else. and is not as afraid to
step out and solo as his studio work
might suggest.

Opening the show for Frampton
next Friday will be David Sancious.
a 21 year old keyboard wizard.
Probably best known for his one
year stint on piano and organ with
Bruce Springsteen, Sancious recent-

I 1y released an incredible solo album

entitled Forest of Feelings. To
anyone expecting rchushed Springs-
teen, it came as a complete surprise.
Produced by Billy Cobham, its in-
fluences arc morejazz than rock.

Simply on the strength ofthat one
album, Sancious has been reaping a
lot of well-deserved praise. and its
not only the PR men who are calling
him the next jazz/rock superstar.

For its ﬁrst show ofthc semester,
Concert Board has assembled an in-
tercsting combination oftalent. And
an err-keyboard player may be the
closest Albany ever gets to the whiz
kid front Asbury Park.

‘ WAS

A Disappointing Winter

by Lon Levin

Feeding your expectations is what network TV does
best. They usually have the best advertising. it‘s their
medium, and when it comes to commercialswthey
know how to do it with more impact than anyone else.
But this talent usually tends to inspire me with so much
anticipation that 1 am crushed when the program
advertised finally comes on the air. And so it was with
"200 Years of American Humor“ starring Jonathan
Winters.

Since the Fall Preview TV Guidel have been looking
forward to this special. Every week i would check the
papers to see if it was goingto be on. I told all my friends
to be on the lookout for the program. I even
contemplated writing my Congressman until 1
remembered that he couldn‘t read.

1 almost gave up when, last week. at 12:55 am,
Tuesday on the Tonight Show. Johnny Carson said his
usual farewells to his guests. Ralph Nader and Jonathan
Winters, and mentioned the special I hugged the TV(l
would have done more but it was plugged in)and went
to sleep a better man. little realizing that NBC had
planted the ﬁrst seeds of hype.

The next day all I could do was daydream. My most
vivid daydream was one in which I played mixed
doubles in squash with Jonathan Winters characters.
While eating dinner. phase two of NBC’s plan went into

effect. A minute long commercial, well done with the
usual fast paced editing to enhance excitement, came
on. 1 never moved from my seat. An hour later, I was
hooked by a 15 second. "Stay tuned for . . . ".

The opening shot was one of Winters with the Grand
Canyon as a backdrop. He spoke seriously about how
our country‘s sense of humor has made it great. Hokey
but obligatory—l let it slide.

The first skit was of George Washington. Not funny. i
thought something was wrong with me. But then came
Ben Franklin. Paul Revere, etc. All not funny. What
happened? My favorite humorist was not making me
laugh. When he improvised, the Jonathan Winters 1
love was funny. But that happened once every 15 minute
segment.

The most astonishing phenomena was that the Hefty
garbage bag commercials starring Winters were f unnicr,
visually superior and overall produced with more
concern than the actual program. At least this served to
redeem him in my eyes.

On the Tonight Show. Winters had me gagging for
breath. He is funniest when he controls the pace. When
conﬁned, his ad libhing is stifled and therefore not as
humorous.

And as for NBC~Wcll, you can lead me to a
program, but you can‘t make me laugh.

Tune in next week.
