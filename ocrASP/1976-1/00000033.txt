and “Sara”. Well. you know~who
they‘re about. anyway.

When Desire was released on
Monday, January 5, that was all that
was heard onthe radio. By that night
I knew “Sara” by heart and “Isis”
was a close second. I was uneasy
about it. First of all, I don't like to
hear an album overplayed. it takes
the freshness out of it. Secondly.
Desire didn’t come out and punch
me in the stomach. announcing its
presence arrogantly. so sure of itself.
like Blood on the Tracks had done.
Desire seemed to be a confusing
mass of strange and exotic sounds,
Dylan speaking French and Spanish
of all things and Emmylou Harris
(Emmylou Harris?) softening up the
backgrounds.

Well I was right. Desire is a mass
of strange and exotic sounds, but
rather than being confusing they're
precise, arranged well. and executed
beautifully. Dylan will never cease to
amaze me. As John Rockwell saidin

York Times "—he never lets himself
become prediuable."

At ﬁrst musical glance. it might
seem that Dylan is back to writing
protest songs. orat least politically
emphatic songs. But they're not for
the general public.‘ not like “ Blowin‘
in the Wind” or “The Times They are
A-Changin'.“ "Hurricane" and
“Joey” are hardly what could be
called rallying political touchstones.
nor are they emotional touchstones
for a generation of disoriented and
discontented youth.

But then again. Dylan's protest"
song were never really meant to stir
up such' a youth movement. Accor-
ding to him the songs were always
personal cries of outrage against an

are now. So you can decide for
yourself whether it's the people or
Dylan who have really changed their
views of “protest” songs.

On second hearing I began to
wonder where on earth Blood on the
Tracks came from. Which was
Dylan? They seem worlds apart. if
you want to be technical the answer's
not Desire. for it was almost totally
co-written with Jacques Levy (who
wrote what exactlyis still a mystery).
But in ways. Desire reflects more of
what Dylan seems to be now than
Blood on the Tracks. using a recent

viewing of the Rolling Thunder

“Romance in Durango". to use two
examples. She does pull out her
country-plaintive stops too much.
however. on “Joey”. giving it more
of a sob-story approachthan it need-
ed or deserved. ‘

One thing stood out as a con-
tinuous line between Blood on the
Tracks and Desire, no matter how
hard I tried to ignore it. Dylan bases
so many of his surrealistic “short
novels in verse” (as Allen Ginsberg
says in the liner notes) in the Old
West; the Old West of Gummoke,
John Wayne. High Noon. deserts.
and Mexicans in sombreros with
long twirly black mustaches. then he
jumps off from there.

There are the standard-style
Western tales, “Lily. Rosemary and
the Jack of Hearts" and “Romance
in Durango"; and the more surrealist
desolate worlds of “Shelter from the
Storm" and “Isis”.

in the middle there are the exotic
settings of “Mozambique” and

0n the one hand Dylan seems to
want to be understood. There's
"Hurricane" and “Joey” (but he
always did speak plainly and clearly
in his protest songs) and especially
“Sara”. which is more explicitly per-
sonal than he's ever been, down to

“Visions of Johanna” here.

Yet there is still Dylan in his white
Rolling Thunder clownface. keeping
us at a distance throughout the rest
of the record. "Isis" is the most im-
mediately striking example, one of
the most eloquent and enigmatic
song I've ever heard; as is “Oh
Sister", which sounds at ﬁrst so sim-
ple yet is really quite laden with all
sorts of symbols and pieces of myths
that ought to keep the analysts hap-
py and hopping for awhile.

Desire is a wonderful, in that
sense—wonder-full album. it is a
coherent and cohesive whole, each
side blending with the other, but still
able to stand alone. Both “socially
conscious" songs are on the begin-
ning of the sides, and each side ends
with a song to a woman (they're real-

And Dylan is a real singer at last.
That smooth voice I marvelled at on
tour is used and controlled very well.
It sounds good. Really good.

It must be interesting in a way to
join in the arguments over Dylan-
symbolism, to enter the ranks of the
"specialists". the English professors
and poets. But that would belike dis-
secting a ﬂower to try and ﬁnd out
why it is beautiful. Take Desire as it
is. in its identity as a living part ofan
amazing. incredibly imaginative
man. it seems as though Dylan's is
not a desire of greed or lust, but
rather one of love, sacriﬁce. and

-Anyone who held the belief that
Star Trek was dead, had onlyto be at
the New York Hilton this past
weekend (Jan 23-25) to have those
beliefs changed. The ﬁrst three floors
of the hotel in the Ballroom areas
resembled sardine cans. crowded
with wall to wall people, all tryingto
attend New York Star Trek'76. The
line of people trying to get into the
hotel stretched three abreast all
around the outside of the . hotel.
Some estimates reached above 30.-
000 people coming in and out.

Those who were f ortunateenough
to ﬁnally get in and reach the Grand
Ballroom were greeted with one of
the best shows ever seen in a Star
Trek Convention. Up on stage was
a full size mockup ofthe Enterprise
Bridge—Spock‘s. Uhura's and Scot-
ty's stations, plus the Command

. Chair. The Navigators console
would not ﬁt on the stage.

it was from here that the stars put
on a 2 hour program of speeches.
and questions and answers; Mark
Lenard (Spock‘s Father. and the
Romulan Commander from
“Balance of Terror"). George Takei
(Sulu). DeForcst Kelley (McCoy),
James Doohan (Scotty). Nichelle
Nichols (Uhura), Leonard Nimoy
(Mr. Spock) and William Shatner
(James Tiberius Kirk).

The past years of New York Con-
ventions would be hard put to match
this record of so many stars at one
place at onetime! And. there were
two show each day and an ad-
ditional one added Saturday evening
to accomodatc the crowds, which
built up usually at the ends of the
programs —— 3000 plus trying to get

out while another 3000 plus are try-
ing to get in. A

The main announcement was ﬁrst
heard at about ll am. on Friday
when George Takei related his
phone conversation with Star Trek‘s
Creator and Executive Producer
Gene Roddenberry. Gene has per-
suaded and coerced Paramount into
a final. deﬁnite production date for
the long promised Star Trek movie
-— tentatively called Star Trek H.
The new movie goes into production
on July 15.1976 with release hopeful-
ly in the Winter of I976. However.
the script to be used has not yet been
selected although there are three in
contention; one of which is Gene
Roddcnbcrry‘s. The others are by
Harlan Ellison and Robert

Silverberg. Script selection should

take another week. but thef'vda‘t'efof ' ~
July l5 shouldfcease any further
procrastination from Parentount.

All the stars said they'd be willing.
to do the ﬁlm. although none of
them can be asked until a script is
settled upon. Anyone interested was
referred to the next Star Trek Coil-
vention Feb. l2-l6 at the Com-
modore Hotel where the guest of
honor will be Gene Roddenberry.
There were only 900 memberships
left at the time ofthe Hilton conven-
tion.

There were other notables thereas
well. NASA was represented by
Gemini IV and Apollo lX astronaut
James A. McDivitt. and Jesco von
Puttkamer of the Ofﬁce of Manned
Spaceﬂight. who when introduced
on the Bridge as a judge at the
Costume Show Saturday evening.
went directly to Scotty‘s‘station.
began pressing buttons on the con-
sole and broke one. Someone yelled
“NASA will get a bill."

Also. there was J. Allen Hynek.

Science Fiction was amply
represented by Harry Harrison. Ben
Bova. Hal Clement. Gordon
Dickson and capped by Harlan
Ellison. Of course. no s-f convention
would be complete without Dr. lsaae
Asimov. One lecture on science ﬁc-
tion by Asimov and Ellison was par-
ticularly interesting. They spent as
much time assailing each other‘s
works (and each other) as they did
discussing s-f. It was a highlight of
the convention for those who were
there. since they are good friends yet
act as enemies (recall Spock vs. Mc-
Coy).

As with other Cons.this one had
some excellent ﬁlms on its program:
200] a Space Orlvrsey. Silent Run-
ning. The Day the Earth Stood 511'”.
Forbidden Planet. and of course.
several “Un-edited for Television"
Star Trek episodes.

 

Jwere calling for a refund. But

am. Why mm onliaefor
hours. then it up to the I

Committee probably didn‘t expat!
everyone to show up Saturday mor-
ning, which happened. (I coursethe
Committee was at fault in many

ways. such as still sellingat the door .

registrations on Sunday. after the
Saturday mob. and giving no
privileges to those who already had
their tickets; all were required to use
the same line. ‘

So what did this Can prove? It
showed that there is deﬁnitely a
market for Star Trek. as do all the
others in dozens of cities inthe U.S.
and around the world. People e
willing to put up with practice y
anything to see these stars and pay
high pricestoo. Those who‘ll paySIZ
for a daily ticket will cenainly pay $3
for a Star Trek movie. All
Paramount executives have to do is
wake up and see it. and stop askingif
the show will sell toothpaste.

As for a possible series. that would
still be two or three years in the
future. depending on the success of
the new movie. Perhaps evcnaseries
of ﬁlms such as the “Planet of the
Apes" series. though with
Roddcnbcrry at the helm and some
cooperation from Paramount. Star
Trek could he even more popular
and much betterthan“Apcs." orthe
James Bond series. The ﬁrst steps
have been taken toward the realiza-
tion of something unprecedented in
television: a revival of a series after 7
years of cancellation. A cancelled
series which is one of the hottest
things in television. The dream of a
new Star Trek is fast approaching
reality.
