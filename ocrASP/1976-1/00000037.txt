Cases in point: Union going to decline to shoot one-and-one on Albany's . ‘ ’
fourth team foul; one ofﬁa‘al handing the ball to Brian Barker, anthh‘en

taking it back to permit a Union substitution; and. despite the protestations

All mechanical errors, clearly outlined in the,rules..yet “not seen" by
Tuesday's personnel. Thing would not have been quite so bad if those were
the only errors. but there were many more. In fact. the ofﬁcials were madeto

here that the Tuesday Tweeties dismally failed. Forget the game; eoncedethe

Danes—yet it almost happened when John Denio hauled the sixofoot, seven-
inch Albany center down like a felled tree and no call was made.

Ask the fans who were there how many fouls they detected, but which were
