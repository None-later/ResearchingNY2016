Women Gymnasts Roll On

by Christine Bellini

Facing their busiest weekend

three—way meet January 23 against
Hofstra and Hunter colleges. dow-

The breakage of the uneven bars
(no injuries) resulted in a three-piece
meet; the beam, vaulting and floor

Although the total results were
low for all three teams. Albany:
46.85. Hofstra; 47.9. and Hunter:
28.30 points, Coach Edith Cobane is
conﬁdent of the team's improve-
ment.

“We're not scoring as well as we
should on the balance beam. but the
team is solid." said Cobane, “We‘re
aiming for the 70’s."

Carla Landsman and Patty
Kampbell took second and third
places on the beam. Cathie Caperna
and Julie Acton gave Albany third
and fourth places in the vaulting.
ﬁnishing up on the floor for Albany
was Carla Landsman (6.56) second.
and Barbara Hommcl was third.

0n the following day Albany
traveled to Queens College and
dumped the city gymnasts by l6
points. 63.l0—47.60.

“We really cleaned up on that
one." says Cobane. “It shows an in-
crease in conﬁdence."

Competing in all four events

took ﬁrst and second on the floor

It‘s easy to saddle a loss upon the backs ofthe whistle-men. Players can

Coaches can rally their teams around the ofﬁcials:“there are seven guys out

The officiating at Tuesday's Albany~Union varsity basketball game was
horrendous. It had no effect onthe score—Union outplayed Albany, and any
who debate the Dutchmen‘s right to that victory are only kidding
themselves—yet never before has such incompetency been put on public

display at $50 a head.

Giving the players machetes. switchblades. and handguns. and then
adopting a"call your ownfouls" method of enforcement. would have been an
improvement. The worst intramural ofﬁciating has never approached

Tuesday's version.

The duty of an ofﬁcial is to keep the game under control. and the Union-
Albany contest was an out of control frec-for-all after thcfirst five minutes of
play. Bodies rolled. faces were raked. and elbows flew all night without the

sounding of a whistle.

A good ofﬁcial must be consistent. His idea of an offensive foul cannot
change from one half to the next. let alone from minuteto minute. What “A”
is allowed as incidental contact must be treated similarly when committed by
“B”. yet once again this was not the case Tuesday. when numerous fouls
which would have drawn ﬁve-minute majors in hockey were ignored more

University Stiller! By Storm

by Combined Dispatches

Biting blizzard-force winds blew
whirling clouds of snow and chilling
temperatures into Albany. forcing
the cit y totake athrcc-day weekend.

SUNYA was but one ofthe many
victims of what weather. experts
called a “superstorm.” SUNYA
President Emmett Fields ofﬁcially
closed the university at 7245’ yester-
day morning. His reason was simple.
“Nobody could get to school."

University buses weren‘t running,
leaving off-campus students off cam-
pus. Icy roads. poor visibility and
blustering winds immobilized many
faculty and student motorists.

One thing. though. was virtually
unaffected. The Quad cafeterias
were in operation yesterday
morning~understaffed but still dis-
hing out.

"I‘m sorry it [SUNYA] had to
close down." said Fields. “but we
were experiencing a hard New York
day. Maybe everyone got caught up
with their work."

Capitol Closed

Hundreds of schools. private in-
stitutions. roads and airports
throughout New York State-were
closed. Even the State Capitol was
still.

Although all of upstate New York
was hit hard. the highest ground—
level gust was recorded in Albany at
67 miles per hour.

According to the National
Weather Service. a cold-air system
moving in from the west collided
with a coastal rainstorm and created
the blizzard. Dropping
temperatures. heavy winds and snow
began at about 3 a.m. Monday mor-
ning in eastern New York. The

weather service ended most blizzard
warnings late yesterday afternoon.

The swift-moving coastal storm
deceived forecasters.

“We didn't predict the severity.“
said Ken LaPrcntu. of the National
Weather Service in Albany. “ We did
predict the change to snow and very
high winds. it got a little colder than
we thought a little faster . . ."

Frostbite Warnings

A special report from the Weather
service called the storm “the most
severe weather in this area in several
years.“ Forecasters urged people to
stay indoors if possible and warned
that exposuretothe cold could result
in frostbite.

An "ofﬁcial" blizzard is a com-
bination of winds in excess of 35
miles an hour. considerable falling

Tenure Case Draws Faculty

by C. S. Santino

According to his colleagues in the
English department. Michael Kauf-
man haspresentedthe strongest case
for tenure in years.

He will probably be fired by June,
I977.

The reason. says Kaufman. who
awaits President Emmett B. Fields‘
final decision in his case. has nothing
to do 'with his teaching or
scholarship. which many cite as be-
ing beyond reproach.

Kaufman feels he is the“victim of
questionable procedures." used by
the administration. “in an effort to
fire junior English professors and
save the graduate program."

Fields. following the recommen-
dations of an outside evaluator‘s
report submitted last fall, is pushing

.toreregisterSUNYA‘s English doc: .

toral program. The program waster-
minated in December by Education
Commissioner Ewald B. Nyquist.

The report effectively calls forthe
hiring of a separate graduate faculty
at the expense of at least a half dozen
junior faculty members. Jerry Paris
and Victor Chang of the English
department have already been
notified that their contracts will not
be renewed.

Kaufman‘s tenure case. which
began last fall , has been beset by
controversy. paradox. and unusual

tactics.

Kaufman passed the first hurdle of
the four-step tenure process. the
departmental review. last October.
The English department voted 49to
4 in favor of tenure and 30 to l9for
promotion.

The recommendation calledKauf-
man "a devoted and highly effective
teacher" who has “a remarkable
range and surencss. a supple and
ﬂexible mind." The report also
acclaimed his published articles as
“pioneering work."

“He is active in the department,
has a sense of community. and has
built an enviable word-of—mouth
reputation here.“ the report states.

High Proﬁts Could Mean Board Cut

wong

FSA General Manager E. Norbert Zahm. rlght. and Management and
Planning Vlce Preatdent John Hartley. Center. at Wednesday's Board
meetlng. At Ielt ls student Board member Sandy Volt.

by Bob Wong

FSA may decrease their board
rates next semester due to excess
profits. These profits were largely a
result of the eight percent hikc pass~
ed hy the FSA Board of Directors
last year.

At the Faculty-Student Associa-
tion Board meeting last Wednesday.
Vice President of Management and
Planning John Hartley surprised
student leaders by askingthc Direc-
tors “to considcr'thc possibility of a
reduction in the board rates."

The food service operations have
made “00.000 more than they did
last year at this time.

According to FSA General
Manager E. Norbert Zahm. the quad
food service operations made a net
income of $257.4l6 for the last six
months of 1975. as compared to a

' $66,843 net income for the last six

months of l974.

The $257.4I6 comprises 156.6% of
the entire net income for the food
service operations. It was projected
to cover only 50%.

It was suggested by a few of the
Directors that the excess in the net
income might be returned to the
students. FSA Director Greg Lessnc
says there was “talk of rebates."

 

It is felt that only if the net income
remains at its present surplus level
can the possibility of a decrease be
uctualizcd.

Zahm cautioned that an incrcnn
in the minimum wage and other luc-
tors may affect the overall net m-
come. Zahm's report states that. “as
higher expenses for the student help

. increase . . . and the now in-
creasing food prices take hold. the
net income can be expected to
decrease significantly."

New Contract

One factor that might affect a
planned decrease or rcbntc is the
SUNY Board of Trustee's new FSA
guidelines. These guidelines call for a
new contract with the State that may
mandate a set cash reserve for all
FSAs. It is feared that the excess
profits may go to set up this cash
reserve. instead of going back to the
students.

Another unknown factor that may
affect the net income and the
possibility of a board decrease is
whether or not the State University
wants to be reimbursed forthe use of

.its facilities by FSA.

This will not be knowntill the con-
tracts are distributed sometime in
the near future.

sylvania watched Phil the
groundhog emerge from hibernation
in his electrically heated burrow. To
no one‘s surprise. Phil saw his
shadow and reentered his
artificially-heated home.

Response

The report also praises Kaufman for
organizing the Humanities lounge.

Kaufman's case came before the
College of Arts and Sciences Faculty
Personnel Committee on December
4. This is the second step in tenure
proceedings.

In what Vice President for
Academic Affairs Philip Sirotkin
himself admitted was an un-.
precedented move. Sirotkin
appeared before that committee to
read “relevant portions" of the
cvaluators‘ report on the re-
registration of SUNY‘s English
Ph. D. program.

The committee voted 6-0 to deny
Kaufman tenure and 6-0 to deny
promotion. citing Kaufman's
Shakespeare scholarship as “ill-
,rcgardcd" and his other articles as
"insignificant."

Kaufman asserts that there is “a
direct causal relationship between
the political situation which sur-
roundsthe English Ph.D.. the visit of
Sirotkin tothat committee. and [the]
unanimously negative vote at the
college level."

Uthcrs suspect a causal
relationship. too. One member ofthe
English department asked Sirotkin if
his appearance before that com-
mittee was "an extraordinary
procedure."

“It was." Sirotkin admitted. “but
you must understand that these are
extraordinary times."

"l know what the allegations are."
Sirotkin told the Albany Student
Press. “l wasn‘t trying to sway the
vote at that meeting. l just wanted to
