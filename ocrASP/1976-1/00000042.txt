. LETTUCE HEADS
A Maryland [drug researcher is
attempting toturn usinto a nation of
lettuce heads.

Bill Olmsted, the operator of a
company called “Natural Enter-
prizcs", claims that he can manufac-
ture a form of legal opium out of
plain. ordinary lettuce.

Olmsted has taken out is series of
ads in alternative papers around the

U.S.. offering either to sell the in- '

structions. or the opium itself. Ac-
cording to the amateur chemist,
several college botany books have
published the procedure for produc-
ing a mildly-intoxicating opium out
of cndivc or cscurolc lettuce.
Olmsted suggests that the only
way to outlaw his product is to out-
law the lettuce too. He explains: “To
make an ounce the really proper
way. it takes six hours, five heads of

lettuce and four gas burners going ’

full blast."

LETHAL BED

A California woman is charging
that her husband attempted to kill
hen—with a watcrbcd.

Cheryl Bates of Mountain View
reportedly told police that her hus-
hnnd, Mark, had arrived home
shortly after midnight-—thoroughly
intoxicated. The woman snidthut an
argument ensued and her husband

 

   
 
  
  
   
  
  
   
  
 

       
 
 

chased her into the bedroom,‘snd
flung her on their watcrbcd. Cheryl
Bates says her husband proceeded to
cut the bed with a knife and tried to’
shove her head into the water.

Police report that the woman's
husband‘s story was somewhat
different: Mark Bates explained to
ofﬁcers that he wasn't trying to
drown his wife—but that he had
fallen down and was merelytryingto
right himself by putting his hand on
his wife‘s hand for leverage. when it
went through the mattress.

C.I.A. NEWSPERSONS

Varivly Magazine reports that

Work for the C.1.A. in exchange for

William Colby has recently denied to

However, the msgszinc Illegal
that House and Senate investigstors
have established that many full-time
correspondents are regularly

says that “payments” in return for
such dcbricﬁngs come “In some
cases as 'a direct salary.” Other
payments reportedly include the

Variety quotes one investigator as
