in the Union game, pulled off a
coaching coup.

“We went to the one-guard of f ense
because Fredonia was using their
size against us and posting their
players low,“ said the Albany Coach.
He also realized that Fredonia's lack
of backcourt pressure would allow
the single guard to bring the ball up-
court unmolcsted. The strategy
worked to perfection and at the
l0:04 mark, a Keane jumper knotted
the score at l6. Keane, as poetic
justice would have it, was the third
forward in the revamped attack.

Two minutes later, State managed
its ﬁrst penetration against the tight
Blue Devil zone and Vic Cesare's two
foul shots put Albany ontopto stay.

Despite the Dane domination, the
half-ﬁlled gym did not havemuchto
scream about during the rather slow
game. The biggest ovations were
heard in a two-minute span near the
end of the ﬁrst half.

With six minutes remaining.
Winston Royal entered the contest
and drew two quick offensive fouls,
taking a tough shot each time and
rising from the court to the roars of
an appreciate audience which has
made the freshman guard its clear
favorite.

The big play, however, came
moments later when Barry
Cavanaugh blocked a shot by Kevin
O'Brien, for one of his three first-
half rejections, and somehow
managed to break ahead ofthe field
to lead a rare Albany fast break. A
pass from Royal, two dribbles and a
leap later and the “Runaway
Freight" was at the line completinga
three-point play to put the Danes up
by five, 27-22. The lead was built to

represented the game's biggest
margin, as the fans, ﬁckle as ever,
cheered several Albany stalls, less
than one week after jeering Union's
use of the same tactics.

The statistics: Fredonia hit sixty-
percent from the floor, but managed
only 33 shots all night against a
pressing man-to—man defense that
forced 2| turnovers, Pete Kawiak,
the game's high scorer with 22, shot 7

of his team‘s 28 points.

Coach Sauers said only early foul
trouble forced the Dancsinto a zone
against Union. Otherwise, he said,

“we would have used the same man
to man defense against them."

Albany, on the other hand, shot a
poor forty-percent from theficld but
got off 25 more shots than the Blue
Devils. From thefoul line, the Danes
were nearly perfect. sinking 20 of 2|

L VP Sirotkin Is Westtcord   

by David Winuibceg

Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs Phillip L. Sirotkin will leave his
SUNYA post June I to head the
Western interstate Commission for
Higher Education (WlCHE) in
Colorado.

in his ﬁve years here, Sirotkin has
been responsible for making difﬁcult
decisions on tenure and budget
allocations, often drawing sharp
criticism from faculty members.

As Executive Director of WlCHE,
Sirotkin will'be responsible for all
programs. services, ﬁnances and per-
sonnel. According to WlCHE‘s
Public information Director Gerry
Volgenau. Sirotkin will “make vir-
tually all the program decisions for
the organization." Sirotkin‘s first ad-
ministrative job was with WlCHE
between 1957 and I960 as Associate
Director for Regional Programs.

Since the l973 resignation of I.

Moyer Humberger as Dean of Arts
and Sciences, Sirotkin has worked
along with division heads here at
SUNYA in making academic policy
decisions. Last year Sirotkin was a
key ﬁgure in the search for a new
Arts and Sciences dean, a position
ultimately left unﬁlled.

SUNYA President Emmett B.
Fields said that Sirotkin has made
“monumental contributions” to thb
university. “He’s been a tower of
strength," said Fields, “I hate to see
him go."

Psychology Professor Caroline K.
Waterman, the center of a tenure
controversy three years ago, feels
that Sirotkin "has not been respon-
sive to the needs and wishes of the
university community.“ in 1973,
Waterman caused controversy inthe
university Senate by bringing up
what she termed “secret memos“
written by Sirotkin on promotions

Internal Politics Cause Crisis At SASU

By Dan Gaines

Possibly as the climax of an inter-
nal crisis, SASU President Bob
Kirkpatrick has been told that he
may be impeached and removed at a
Binghamton conference this
weekend of the Student Association
ofthe State University. '

Why?

One theory is that he could
become the victim of a power play
led by SASU Vice President Betty
Pohonka and others. By spreading
false rumors and exposing minor
corruption that they themselves are
guilty of. the Pohonka group has
plotted since October to take over
SASU, says this theory. Pohonka
has been a do-nothi‘ng Vice Presi-
dent, it goes on, while all the real
work of SASU has been done by the
present staff, Kirkpatrick and Vice
President Stu Haimowitz. This is
Kirkpatrick's theory.

The other theory is Pohonka‘s:
Her group is trying to save SASU,
which has recently lost nine member

schools, from the incompetence and
destructive policies of Kirkpatrick
and Haimowitz.

Pohonka‘s groups has involved
SUNY Central and the non-SASU
schools of SUNY Central‘s student
arm, the Student Assembly: SASUis
a private corporation that lobbys.
Kirkpatrick is also President of the
Assembly; indeed, the two
organizations are parallel.

Pohonka‘s people instigated two
studies. The results:

— Yesterday, SUNY Vice
Chancellor Clifton Thorne found a
solutionto a problem of alleged cor-
ruption by SASU in using the Stu-
dent Assembly to xerox and to ob-
tain supplies at SUNY Central's
Twin Towers ofﬁces.

— Tomorrow, a report will be
given at Binghamton by a Student
Assembly investigative committee.
which was set up to look into the cor-
ruption and to ﬁnd out why the
Assembly had already spent 28 ofits
budget by December.

Tapes of the investigative com-
mittee‘s study were burned by
SUNYA SA President Andy
Bauman, a committee member.
Bauman says be destroyed the tapes
to protect the confidentiality of the
hearings: “There had‘ been false
rumors spread by some Pohonka
group people that the Attorney
General and the Albany County Dis-
trict Attorney had been called in by
Thorne, and Bauman was underthc
impression a court order might come
at any time for the tapes.

An informed source said that the
committee will suggest that the Stu-
dent Assembly have a tresurer and
thatthere be tighter reimbursement
procedures for trips and meals. The
source said that the committee will
come out against Kirkpatrick and
Haimowitz, in some way expressing

. a lack of conﬁdence in them.

But Bauman said be "sensed
political overtones" in the com-
mittee. Sue Hirschkowitz, another
member, was among those who

Wellington Hotel Management Offers A
Settlement To Recent Robbery Victims

by Ed Moser

In a tnecting Tuesday night at the
Wellington hotel, Dorm Director
Fred Litt told students that the
hotel's General Manager, Reuben
Gersowitz, would pay back a “more
than fair percentage" of the value of
items stolen fromtheir rooms during
the winter recess.

“i met with Mr. Gersowitz yester-
day," said Litt. “He says money has
arrived {to pay for damages] . . . it
comes to a percentage, which he did
not care to tell me; he said it was
more than fair. I would think much
more than 50 percent."

Litt said Gersowitz would like to
meet privately with each person
robbed in order to work out a settle-
ment. On Tuesday morning Ger-
sowitz sent notices to students ask-
ing for their “school schedule, sothat
a convenient personal meeting time
can be arranged."

Student reaction to Utt‘s talk was

mixed. RA Kevin Kovacs said the
students should “all stick together,
and ifdissatisfied with 60 percent,“ a
ﬁgure often mentioned as a possibili—
ty during the meeting, should use
legal action to get fuller payment.

Another of those robbed said the
Wellington management “wants us
to come in alone and play on
people's emotions, so that we'll take
out [from the full value of goods
stolen]."

Watchful Waiting

Others preferred to wait and see.
“I‘d have to see what Gersowitz ,is
settling for," one student said.

Litt was pleased with the Ger-
sowitz proposal. The idorm direc--
tor, who dcscribes himself as “in the
middle” between the Wellinpon
students and managemnet. said of
the affair. "it's over. hopefully. l'm
hoping the settlement is enough to
satisfy everyone." Litt termed the
management's response as more

than prompt: "Gersowitz promised a
settlement in two weeks. In the real
world, you‘d be waiting months."

Kovacs was unhappy with Litt,
whom he feels is reluctant to un-
tagonize the management in fear of
endangering his position of Dorm
Director. " He's been looking for a
raise for a longtime, " said Kovacs of
Litt.

Vet Litt feels that to hassle the
management would only cause trou-
ble: "The Wellington is a necessity
with a 105-! l0 percent enrollment. if
we make a big stink, possibly this
place won't be here next semester."

Future Preeatliona

Litt said there would be
precautions against future robberies.
“There'll be electricians in the
building in a short time .

Havckost (the Wellington's
Manager) says there'll be no keys
given. and no more than two doors
at a time will be opened for them.”

Thornc's study was prompted by
Pohonka group discussions with
him. The study was approved by his
SUNY superiors and satisﬁed his
legal obligations. The plan is for

and tenure. -

Another outspoken faculty
member. Bernard K. Johnpcll. of
Political Sdence, had this comment
on Sirotkin‘e resignation: “If I can't
say something nice about somebody,
personally I won't say it.”

Humanities Dean Ruth A.
Schmidt feels Sirotkin has worked
well with the academic deans. She
said, “I don‘t know of anyone more
hard-working and dedicated to the
university ."

David Coyne, Chairperson of
Central Council and frequent stu-
dent spokesman, feels that, “The
resignation of Vice President
Sirot kin marks the removal of one of
the most controversial ﬁgures in the
recent SUNYA administration."
Coyne says that, “Hopefully, the
opening of the new Fields era will
give the new Igeneral his ﬁrst oppor-
tunity to bring in one of his own
lieutenants -——a change expected to
be for the better."

WlCHE, the organization that
Sirotkin will soon be in charge of,
was started in l95l by the Western
Governors' Conference to “improve
the quality of education beyond the
high school." The organization, has-
ed at the University of Colorado
Campus at Boulder, represents 13

As for the spring vacation break, Litt
and Gersowitz “made a point that
there‘ll be no repair work done dur-
ing those weeks."

Gersowitz feels that the students
jumped the gun" in acting on the
robberies. He said. “My main con-
cern was to take care of the
students."

It is not known if there has been
any progress in catching the person
or people who stole the over $2,000
worth of goods. An ofﬁcer at the

said, “we can't reveal anything we‘re
