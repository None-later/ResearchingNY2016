med program. “Without a Pro-med
Advisory Committee}? he explained.
“more and more students would turn
to the pie-med society for help."
Schmidt said,“This would put much
more of a demand on'the time of the

society's ofﬁcers, who have to study
for medical school themselves."
Schmidt is happy with the way
SUNYA‘s Pre-med Advisory Board
has operated. “I know that at some

 

schools the pre-med committee acts

 

to screen students out. Here, anyone
can get an evaluation fromthe com-
mittee and» apply to medical school.
no matter how slim their chances of
acceptance.

“The Pre-med Advisory Board is

the onlything that putsafoundation

Schmidt. “without it, we could go
back to the days when this was the
state teachers college and no one got
into medical school from here."

For whatever it's worth, the inter-

nal' Reveiiue service reports that

since 1969.

The IRS also notes that, for the
ﬁrst time, the number of women
millionaires outnumbers the men.
There are reportedly 9l,000 females
in the category. compared to j ust 89,-
000 well-heeled males.

   

ENEMA SALUTE

Frank Zappa and The Mothers of
Invention have added a bizarrc'new
touch to their act—a salute to the
notorious enema bandit who was
ﬁnally arrested in Ohio last year.

The enema bandit, identiﬁed by
police as Michael Kenyon, terroriz-
ed college women for nearly a decade
by breaking into their apartments at
gunpoint and then—for reasons
never explained—Aadministering
warm—water enemas to his victims.

Zappa‘s routine involves a short
skit in which the Mothers‘sax player
Napoleon Block, wavas a dripping
enema bag on stage, asking for
volunteers from the audience. There
have been no takers.

FINGERMONEYNAIL

' A Dallas beauty salon warns that '

nail-biters may be literally chewing
up their profits.

The Creative Airs Salonin Dallas

reports that it pays anywhere from
25 cents to $2 for each ﬁngernail
that is at least a third-of-an-inch
long.
Salon owner Norm Heinz ex-
plains that the clipped trails are later
resold for ﬁngernail transplant
operations where a set of IO clipped
nails goes for $35.

Heinz estimates that some ner-
vous people—without even knowing
it—have chewed off thousands of
dollars worth of nails.

 

TRASH CASH

The same corporations which
produce most of America‘s throw-
away containers are reportedly gear-
ing up to cash in on the tons oftrash
churned out _each day in the U.S.

Pacific News Service reports that
the packaging industry has formed a
trade association known as the
National Center for Resource
Recovery. The Center has launched
a multi-million dollar program to
construct recycling plants that can
recover valuable metals and material
at garbage dumps inthelargcst U.S.
cities.

Among those involved in the new
project are Coca-Cola, U.S. Steel,
Reynolds Aluminum, Alcoa, Con-
tinental Can and Budweiser; the

organization isrchalred by Pepsi--
»-. Cole's Donald Kendall.

The packaging industry, which
uses nearly half of allthe paper in the
country each year, has strongly lob-
bied against deposit or returnable
bottles and cans.

Paciﬁc News states that the in-
dustry is encouraging Americans to
use throw-aways—and then is quiet-
ly cornering the market for the
recovery of materials from throw-
away containers. ‘Pacific News says
that the packaging industry is “snif-
ﬁng a goldmine in the nations gar-
bage pits."

ANTI-SPY HELP

With all those stories about CIA
and FBI spying on American citizens
a Menlo Park, California, ﬁrm has
been set up to help people ﬁnd out if
the government has a ﬁle on them.

The company. Freedom of Infor-
mation Services.
offers to help identify in which of
nearly 200 government bureaus a
person‘s ﬁle might be contained—
such astthlA,the FBI, orthelRS.
The fee for this work is SIS.

The ﬁrm‘s president, Rainer
Mahlmann, says that a professional
service is needed because the govern-
ment can easily use red tape to con-
ceal ﬁles from individuais.

U.F.O. CITY

One of the nation's most unusual
Bicentennial projects may be the
Lake City, Pennsylvania, “U.F.O.
Port.“

The tiny community of 2300
residents is planning to spend $6000
constructing the world's ﬁrst
“U.F.0. I’on“. a special landing
stripfor flying saucers. Plans call for
a loo-foot diameter pad to be built
on a secluded. one-acre site near
Lake City.

Why a UFO. site for the
Bicentennial? Project Director Jim
Mecdcr explains: "Everyone else is
looking back 200 years and restoring
buildings and writing books. We
wanted to look in the other direction
— to the future.
