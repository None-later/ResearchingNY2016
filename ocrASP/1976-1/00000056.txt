. Rhempsinitus possessed a vast
. fortune in silver. so greatrthat no
subsequent king came anywhere
‘ near it—let alone surpassed it. In
order to keep the treasure safe, he
proposed to have a stone building
put up. with one of its walls forming
a part of the outer wall of Isis palace.
The builder be employed had designs
upon the treasure and ingeniously
contrived to construct the wall in
such a way that one of the stone
blocks of which it was composed
could easily be removed by a couple
of men—or even by one..

When the new treasury was ready,
the king's money was stored away in
it; and after the lapse of some years
the builder. then on his death-bed,
called his two sons and told them
how clever he had been. saying that
he had planned the device of the
movable stone entirely for their ben-
ﬁt. that they might live in afﬂuence.
Then he gave the precise
measurements, and instructions for
its removal, and told them that if
only they kept the secret well, they

the level of the money in the jars had
still further fallen (for the thieves

took the precaution of ordering

Now the young man's mother was
deeply disiraed bythistreatmem of
her dead son's body, and beggedthe
one who wasstill aliveto doall be
possibly could to think of some way
of pttingit back. and eventhreaten-
ed. if he refined to listento her. to go
to the king and denounce him as the
theif.

The young man made many ex-
cuses. but to no purpose; his mother
continued to pester him. until at last
he thought of a way out of the dif-
ﬁculty. He ﬁlled some skins with
wine and loaded them on to
donkeys. which he drove to the place
where the soldiers were guarding his
brother's corpse. Arrived there. he

/ ﬁve a pull on the necks of two or
three of the skins. to make them
hang down. and untied the
fastening. The wine poured out. and
the young man started to roar and
bang his head. as if in despair of
knowing which donkey to deal with

wine streaming all over the road,
seized their pots and ran to catch it.

piece of luck. ,
The young man swore at them in

pretended rage. which the soldiers

did their best to soothe. until ﬁnally

he changed his tune. and appearing

to have recovered lib temper. (hove
the donkeys out of the roadway and
bean to rearrange the wine-skim on
thdr backs.

Meanwhile. as he chatted with the
soldiers, one of them aacked a joke
at his expense and made him laugh.
whereupon he made them a present
of a wineskin. and without more
ado they all sat down to enjoy
themselves. and urged their benefac-
tor to join the party and share the
drink. The young manIet himself be
persuaded, and soon. as cup
succeeded. cup. and the soldiers
treated him with increasing
familiarity. he gave them another
skin.

Such a quantity of wine was too
much for the guards; very drunk and
drowsy, they stretched themselves
out at full length and fell asleep on
the spot. This was the young man‘s
chance: waiting till the dead of
night. he took down his brother's
body and—to show he had the laugh
of them—shaved the right check of
each of the guards. Then he put the
corpse on the donkeys‘ backs and
returned home. having done
successfully what his mother
demanded.

The king was very angry when he
learnt that the thiel‘s body had been
stolen. and determined at any cost to
catch the man who had been clever
enough to bring off such a coup. I
ﬁnd it hard to believe the priests‘ ac-
count of the means he employed to
catch him—but here it is: he sent his
own daughter to a brothel with
orders to admit all comers. and to
compel each applicant. before gran-

The ‘  obeyed her father‘s
orders, and the thief. when he came
to know ths reason for what the was
doing. could not resist the tempta-
tion to go one better than the kingin
ingenuity. He cut the hand and arm
from the body of a man who hadjust
died, and putting them under his
cloak. went to visit the king’s
daughter in her brothel. When she
asked him the question which she
had asked all the others. he replied
that his wickedcst deed was to cut off
his brother‘s head when he was
caught in a trap in the king’s
treasury, and his cleverest was to
make the soldiers drunk. so that he
could take down his brother's body
from the wall where it was hanging
The girl immediately clutched at
him; but under cover of the darkness
the thief pushed towards her the
hand of the corpse, which she seized
and held tight in the belief that it was
his own. Then. leaving it in her
grasp, he made his excape through
the door.

The cleverness and audacity of
this latest exploit ﬁlled the king with
astonishment and admiration; soon
after the news of it reached him. he
sent to every town in Egypt with a
promise to the thief, should he give
himself up. not only of a free pardon
but of a rich reward. He wastakenrat
his work; the thief presented himself.
and Rhampsinitus signalized his ad-
miration for the most intelligent of
all mankind by giving him his
daughter in marriage. The Egyp-
tians. he said, were the cleverest na-
tion in the World. but thisfellow beat
the lot.

1r.» ' ”

by R. Corblrt ﬂout:th

' Foreign winemakers who visit the
Urtited States are usually amazed by
the wide variety of different wines is
single vintner can'produce.

A European winery tends to stick
to whatever basic product type is
traditionally made in its locality. but
it is not unusual to ﬁnd a California
producer who covers every style 'of
wincmaking from the Rhine in Ger-
many to Chianti in Italy. Calif ornia‘s
unique blessings of soil and climate
make it possible. which is all to the
good, but it does call for a departure
from old world labeling methods.

 

To tell the consumer something
about the kind of wine he can expect
in the bottle. an American
winemaker may label the product
with the name of the European
locality where that kind of wine
originated. immediately preceded or
followed bythe name of the place the
wine was actually made. Thus
"Burgundy" is a‘wine made in the
Burgundy region of France. while
“Burgundy of California" is a wine
made here in the relatively rich style
most people associate with the
French product.

Wines with linked geographic
names like California Chablis,
California Rhine, California Chian-
ti. California Sherry and California
Champagne are called “generic.” as
are those sold under general
category descriptions such as “pink
table wine.“ (“Vin Rose" is simply a
translation of “pink wine" into
French.)

Nearly all wines. including those
of the most famous chateaux of
France. are made from blends of
different grapes. The blend used in a
generic wine is entirely up to the
vintner. He may use only a few or a
dozen or more varieties. and he may
or may not blend so that the
characteristics of one grape
predominate.

If a winemaker does make a blend
in which the taste and smell of one
variety of grape are predominant.
and (for American wines) the wine
derives at least 5| percent of its
volume from thcjuicc ofthat grape.
the wine may (but need not) be
labeled with the name of the grape.
That's all a varietal wine is. Wines
bearing the names of their predomi-
nant grapes (or groups of grapes
legally considered one variety) in-
clude Sauvignon Blanc. Riesling.
Barbara. Muscatth and a host of
other names.

It is not true that a varietal wine is
necessarily better than a generic
wine. but it is likely to have a more
distinctive taste. Highly distinctive
wines are a great pleasure. more so as
one becomes more accustomed to
wine drinking. Nevertheless. I often
prefer a generic wine, either because
a less complex ﬂavor is more ap—
propriate to the occasion or because
I have come to know and like the
particular characteristics of a certain
generic.

in short. the best wine is the one
that suits you at the time. whether
the grape be eponymous or
anonymous.

The Second Honeymoon

     

    

by Lon Levin

Comedy during the Golden Age of television was
suppposcdly at its best. Unquestionably. there were
some great minds constantly experimenting with the
new medium—Sid Cacscr. Milton Berle. Lucille Ball.
Jack Benny. But were things funnier?

The notionthat people ofthe 1950's had a better sense
of humor wasevidenccd bythe fact that Eisenhower and
Nixon Were very popular. Surely there must have been
an exciting uniqueness inthe spontanaiety ofthe showa.
Of course, the same mistakes are made today that were
made during this live era; technology has just ﬁgured
out a way to cover them up.

For those of us who weren't alive then. the only
contact with this era is reruns. We watch. not for
nostalg'a‘s sake. but with a genuine interest of being
entertained. We discard all the archaic trivia andlaugh.
The shows aren‘t funnier than today‘s, they are just
simply funny

Last Monday the Honeymooners came back for a
visit. As we(the gang) watched. the ﬁrst comment was
“It‘s deﬁnitely not the sumel". We agreed. There we sat,
longing for our prenatal days. feeling nostalgic for a

period we never lived throug .
everyone got fat except for Gleason.. that they got
twenty years older. that they used new camera angles.
and that Ralph‘s busdriver uniform. with its wide
lapels. looked more like a leisure suit. We were so
wrapped up in our hurt emotions that we couldn't just
sit back and enjoy ourselves. Right in front of us was
one of the classic comedy teams and all wecould do was
complain about accuracy.

Of course. the characterization was not the same as
old. but people do have a tendency to change after
twenty years. Alice never zingcd Ralph once. and her
mother looked younger than everyone else. The
Norton-Ralph sketches were the highlights of theshow.
Their comic rapport was still entirely intact.
Unfortunately. each routine never adhered to another
to form a whole concept.

The show was not a return of the Honeymooners. It
was a vehicle for Gleason and Carney to show off their
comic talents. With any luck. the next time the
Honeymooners return. I will lapse into an amnesiac
state.

Tune in next week!
