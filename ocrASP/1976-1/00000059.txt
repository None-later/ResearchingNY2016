I,  Pipeline I
Diplomacy a

by Robert lartell

This winter many Americans are shivering
in their cold living rooms, while the govern-
ment in Washington deliberately delays gran-
ting pemiitrion to bring in natural gas from
Alaska where abundant reserves wait to be
tapped.

In order to solve America's chronic fuel
shortages, it is necessary to build a large-
diameter gas pipeline from the North Slope of
Alaska through the frozen bottoms of the
Mackenzie River Valley and Canada's
Western Plains all the way to our Midwest.

Eventually a big gauge oil pipeline, running
parallel to the gas pipeline, may also become
necessary. But for the time being the gas
pipeline would do and there is no
technological or ﬁnancial problem about it.
The project has been throughtly studied and
ﬁnancing is available from a consortium of
U.S. and Canadian energy companies—20 of
them. They have formed Alaskan Arctic Gas
Pipeline Co. and in March l974—almost two
years ago — they applied forthe necessary per-

over. There would be enough clean. non-
polluting natural gas to heat all the homes and
fuel all‘the industries'at a, reasonable price:
The cornpaniesinvolved inthat projeet'are not
asking the government for any subsidies. loan
guarantees or any other handouts to start
building their pipeline.»

The reason is quite simple. The rich
Prudhoe Bay oil and gas fields have been
found to continue and expand downalope into
the bottom of the wide sunken valley
geolop'sts call the Beaufort Basin—under the
shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea. The latest
estimates credit the Alaskan part of the
Beaufort Basin with L4 quadrillion cubic feet
of gas. That represents more than l50 years’
supply of this country's needs of natural gas at
the current rate of consumption.

The ultimate oil reserves in the huge struc-
tures under the Beaufort Sea are estimated to
run-into the hundreds of millions of barrels——
matching those in the Middle East.

But there is a fly in the ointment. If this big-
gauge gas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to
Chicago is built and this country gets the
natural gas available in the Beaufort Basin.
there will be no need to import gas from
Siberia. And Armand Hammer‘s big scheme
to develop the Yakutian gas reserves in
Eastern Siberia with your tax dollars is bound
to founder. Also. Soviet-American detente,
based on the Soviets‘ expectations tohavethis
country save: their sagging economy might
also collapse.

Such an outcome is unacceptable to the
powers that be in Washington. So the whole
project is in deep freeze, you might say. The
gas we desperately need for heating will re»
main buried in the Far North. while hapless
Americans shiver in their unheated homes.

" I HoVe oCreom

by Steven Particle ‘
There are many of you out there reading this who have come to the conclusion that the

practice of slavery has long ago withered away. Well, you are wrong. Right here, within this great
nation of ours, there is still one group sustained in bondage; one group who must follow the every
whim of their heartless masters. Yes. Ring Dingseverywhere are helpless captives. and lamtruly
outraged.

Unfortunately. no one knows how this practice began. but what is known is that the Drake‘s
Company. the biggest and most brutal slave traders of pastries anywhere. force harmless cakes
down onto a sheet of thick cardboard agaimt their will. Quickly and without warning, a wrapper
of cellophane envelopes our unfortunate friends, so tightly that even some housewives have
trouble removing it. Fearing what will ultimately happen to them. some Ring Dings just fall
apart or melt away. long before they ever reach their destination.

Those that are bold struggle along. as they are placed in cartons. dozens at a time. Wordlessly.
they watch the last rays of light being closed off from them. Across state lines they travel.
huddled together for the last time in the back of huge trucks. Finally they reachtheir destination,
where the Ring Ding faces the humiliation of being placed on a stand for all to see.

Yet.' I have not told the worst part of their story; for the pastries who find themselves most
oppressed are the smallest, the youngest Ring Dings. The little fellers, who. for some unknown
reason are not allowed to mature to full size, are nevertheless subjected to the same treatment.
The Drake's people, simplyto economize. ruthlessly force twelve of these ‘J uniors' (as they are so
fondly referred to).into aluminum straightjackets, then jam them into a box where only three
could be comfortable.

What is amazing about this whole process. is that the Ring Dings themselves. show little, if
any. resistance. Others must take up the struggle for their emancipation. and to date those that
have, have had little success.

With great determination. l petitioned the Drake's Company for their liberty. Mr. Legrce. a
representative of Drake‘s. simply tried to appease me.

“I honestly don't know what you want. Why are you so radical? This is the system, and we
simply work under it. Besides, what would a Ring Ding do if it were free? What could it do?
They're so round and thick, why i doubt they have any brains at all. I‘m sure those brown ones

can't come to any use, no how. And besides." he added. “our children love them.

With that remark, I could no longer debate. for the truth of the matter is that American
children do desire these poor devils food cakes. and rant and rave until their parents are forced to
become a partyto this injustice. For a mere quarter. they are bought. then brought into our finest
homes. Here they are refrigerated, sometimes for weeks. then harshly gobbled up. and their
remains disposed of .

Each day thousands of Ring Dings confront the end of the road, just as many others begin on
theirs. routinely being led to destruction. For now. they can only hope, and pray. that freedom
will one day shine through their ever-present darkness. Ring Dings everywhere hope for their
savior. They are waiting for Martin Luther Ring Ding.
