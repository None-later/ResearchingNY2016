Basketball.

Albany State and Siena.

Almost anything can happen. and
probably already has in the 34
previous meetings betWeen the
capital district rivals.

1957: The rivalry resumed after a
nine year pause. Siena comes out on
top. 75—66. and the ﬁrst "incident"
occurs when Siena fans respond to a
technical foul by liberally sprinkling
the court with wet toilet paper.
Albany islaughed off the coun tothe
chant of “Beat Albany High".

1958: Albany beats“St. Rose" for
the ﬁrst time, 62—46. (St. Rose: a
local parochial school; Albany High:
the local public school. reflecting on
the fact that Albany was a teachers'
college in those days.)

1962: The ﬁrst thriller. Jim
Oppedisano connects on a ﬁve-
footer at the buzzer to send the
delirious Peds fans home with a 49—
47 win in triple overtime. (Albany‘s
nickname was the Peds prior to
becoming Great Danes). The last

“Check that score. Beat St. Rose."

EEP Sea: Siena Sucks.

The rivalry resumes tomorrow at
6:30 p.rn. whenthe Albany State and
Siena junior varsity basketball teams
take the court for the annual
preliminary prior to the highly
touted. emotional mening of ' the
respective varsities.

Both varsity teams are flirting
with the .500 mark this season. Siena
is 8-8. and while the lndians are con-
ceded the tougher schedule (includ-
ing six Division 1 opponents) they
have not been successful against the
better opposition (1-5 versus Divi-
sion 1 teams).

The Great Danes are 8-7. losers to
Buffalo in their only Division 1 con-
test thus far (Siena also lost to the
Bulls. and by a larger margin than
Albany's one point heartbreaker).

Against common opponents
Siena holds aclearedge. The’lndians

have defeated Union. RBI, and
Potsdam. each of whom have beaten
the Great Danes (Union victimized
Albany twice). Both teams hold .500
records against Division 11 op-
ponents.

Albanyis coming off an important
66-50 State University of New York
Athletic Conference victory over
Fredonia. The Danes are 5-1 in Con-
ference play. tied with Oneonta for
second place behind undefeated
Plattsburgh.

While Albany has suffered theloss
of playmaking guard Gary Trevett
(broken wrist). the Danes haveto be
encouraged by the steadily im-
proving play of six-foot seven-inch
center Barry Cavanaugh. named as
last week‘s honorable mention
Rookie ofthe Week in Division 111.
Cavanaugh is averaging 11.2 points
a game this year. 15.6 in his last ﬁve
contests.

Swimmers Whip Union,
64-41; Cop Eight Events

The Albany State Great Danes
Aquamen collected their first vic-
tory since December with an im-
pressive win over Union by the score
of 64—41.

The Danesjumped off to an early,
and what proved to be an invincible
lead. by sweeping the opening event.
the 400 yard Medley Relay. and the
seven points that went with it.
Albany then proceeded to capture
ﬁrst place in six out of the next seven
events. including a double-win by
Steve Bookbinder in the,1000 yard
freestyle. and the 2m yard butterfly.
“Steve Bookbinder’s double-win in-
cluded his seasonal best in the 1000

yard freestyle." said Coach Ron'

White. “It was very solid swimming,

which. along with a number of per-
sonal best times, such as Fred
Zimmerman in the 200 yard in-
dividual medley. propelled us to the
victory."

All told. Albany won eight ofthir-
teen races. The Danes started off
very hot. capturing seven of their
ﬁrst eight events.

The victory raises the Aquamen's
win-loss record to 2—4, and drops
Union to an 0—3 mark.

The ﬁnal home meet of the year
for the Aquamen pits them against
SUNY Conference rival. Oswego.
The meet is scheduled for 1 pin
tomorrow A victory would let
Albany ﬁnish with a 2—2 Con-
ference mark.

Junior guard Mike Suprunowicz
leads the Danes in scoring (13.8)
followed by forward Bob Audi(12),
Vic Cesare (I 1.4). and Kevin Keane
(8). 1f the Danes have an inherent
weakness it is the need for a solid
ballhandler to replace Trevett—
possibly freshman Winston Royal.

The Indians are led by six-foot '

ﬁve-inch forward Steve Walters who
averages more than 20 points a
game. He and forward Gary Holle
(six-foot six inches) both scored 35
points against Canisius Tuesday, but
the Indians blew a ten point lead and
lost. Steve Raczynski (six-feet eight-
inches) is the indians' center, and the
guards are veterans Tim Welchons
and Wayne Meyer.
Two Keys To Victory

Albany couch Doctor Richard
Saucrs sees two keys to a Dane vio-
tory: controlling Siena's forwards.
particularly Walters; and keeping
Cavanaugh out of foul trouble.

“The center situation is of great
importance from our side ofthc pic-
ture." said Sauers. “1 rate Ruczynski
and Cavanaugh even, so foul trouble
becomes a major factor. if Rao-
zynski were to foul out we‘d have a
great advantage. and the reverse
would be the case without
Cavanaugh."

The Danes have one major advanc
tuge. according to Saucrs: the home
court.

“You know what the home court
means in this kind of game. where
you can throw out records and talent
in favor of emotion." Sauers con-
tinued. “There is no question about
their beingthe better club. 1’11 admit
that any time."

Siena‘s coach Bill Kirsch echoed
Sauers’ comments.

“The rivalry is a great one. and
friendly. ihope." said Kirsch. “Right
now I'm just worried about Satur-
day. It will be ourthird road game in
a row. and we know State will be
tough."

two minutes of regulation. and the
ﬁrst two overtimes were scoreless.

During halftime. both contingents
of ..fans marched around the
Washington Armory (the site of
most of the early meetings between
the two schools). Siena's fans carried
a sign which read “Whatthe fuck is a
Ped".

1963: Siena swept both games,
60—52 and 52—44.

1965: Ed Marakawitz‘s jumper
with ﬁve seconds to play gives Siena
a 50—48 lead, and a win when the
fans swarm onto the court and
prevented an Albany time-out and
resumption of play.

combined to commit 55 personal
fouls (31 in the ﬁrst half) and two

throws with four seconds remaining
won that one for Albany, 73—71.
The other how was ﬁve-foot ten-
inch Mark Constantine who played
forward and scored 17 points.

Stooges”. as subs Tom Doody.
Mark O‘Donnell. and Tim Jursak

15 points and Albany pulled oil" the
greatest win of Doc Sauers‘ career. at
Siena.

All so ﬁtting, as State fans were in-
f uriated by an admission fee for the
ﬁrst time. Albany retaliated by for-

tion) for $100.

win comes against Siena. 85—70. A

play for 23 minutes.

1972: The fans were at their Worst.
as a brawl exploded all over the Ar-
mory and the game was ended with
1:23 showing on the clock. and
Albany ahead. 83—71.

in the Capital District rematch
that year. the Danes pull offa major
upset, beating the undefeated ln-
dians onthe hot hands of John Quat-
trocchi (25 points) and Reggie Smith
(23).

1973: 6,500 fans set the crowd
record at the Armory in the famous
offensive foul game (Albany's Dave
Welchons was called for charging
with the score 76—75, and his basket
on the driving layup was disallowed)
in which Albany overcame a 17 point
deficit only to fall short.

1974: The Danes left the court
trailing 47—40 at the half tothejeers
of Siena's 400 fans (“check that
score”), but Byron Miller and the
rest made the indians eat their words
in an unreal 84—83 comebackcr.
Miller‘s winner came with 14
seconds to play: Siena's Steve
Walters missed a ﬁfteen-footer. and
Pete Koola stole the inbounds pass
to lock it up.

Last year Siena won handily after
an even ﬁrst half.

One thing is certain. Tomorrow
night. the action will be fast and
furious. both on and off the court.

Police Status

by Paul Rosenthal

Campus Security ofﬁcers may
soon be granted full police status if a‘
proposal made by the SUNY Board
of Trustees is passed by the State
Legislature.

The proposal was drafted by the
Board‘s Campus Security Task
Force in response to complaints
made by security ofﬁcers at. various
SUNY schools. Presently. Campus
Security personnel are classified as
peace officers. a status the officers
say is a hinderance to their proper
functioning.

Security ofﬁcers at SUNY schools
are provided for under the State
Education Law. The proposed
legislation would grant “police of-
ﬁcer" status under the Criminal
Procedure Law.

Past problems in criminal
prosecutions have prompted the
Board of Trustees to propose the
change. Although courts and other
police agencies have questioned the
legal authority of the Education
Law, SUNY delayed action on the
issue. Administrative Aide Russ
Gugino said. ‘tWejust felt we didn't
have to do that."

Questions have been raised about
how the change would be visible on
SUNY campuses. SUNYA Assistant
Director of Security John Henighan
shrugged the proposal off. saying.
"As far as our day-to-day affairs on
this campus. it won't make much
difference." He feelsthatthe need for
the change comes as a result of the
uncertain status of campus police.

Although court challenges have
occurred. Henighan says there have
been no problems here, due to good
rapport between individuals within
different agencies. But he says. “That
attitude could change at any time."

SASU President Bob Kirkpatrick,
u non-voting member of the Board
of Trustees. has voiced his opposi-

SUNYA Campus Security Ofﬁcers. who
could be avoided. Ii preventive measures are taito

tion to the proposal. He said. “It
creates many complications which
do not exist under the Education
Law." He fears the change in status
could change the self-perception of
Campus Security ofﬁcers.

SUNY ofﬁcials say the proposed
change would not affect current
regulation of ofﬁcers' rights to carry
guns on campus. Currently. the
president of the individual campus is
charged with outlining a ﬁrearms
policy. Certain supervisory per-
sonnel may carry guns while on duty
at SUNYA.

The proposal has been sent to
Governor Carey, who would have to
present it to the Legislature on
behalf of the SUNY Board of
Trustees. The legislation would then
go through the Committee on
Higher Education. A spokesman
said the question has not yet come
before the committee.

Kirkpatrick doubts the change to
“police officer" status would be in
the best interests of SUNY students.
While the Board of Trustees feels the
legislation would simply clarify a

Students Take Action

by Ed Moser

Alumni Quad students are
prepared to statistically rate the bits
runs. in order to provide hard data
for gripes concerning the recent
slowdown in service.

At it Thursday meeting of some
sixty Alumni residents. it was decid-
ed to observe and rate service at
selected spots for two consecutive
days. Breaking up the bus schedule
day into sixteen one hour periods,
groups of volunteers will look for
such things as how close the actual
bus runs jive with the published
schedule. and the number of people
which overcrowded buses leave
behind.

“The bus drivers already make out
their own forms." said the meeting‘s
chairperson. Bryant Monroe.

"Frank Kopf [the Director of the
Physical Plant] swears bythem. But
i don't believe him."

SA President Andy Bauman said
he was impressed with the way Presi-
dent Fields had handlcd the situa-
tion. Bauman had met with Fields.

whom he said at ﬁrst "didn't have
much of an idea that anything at all
was wrong." Bauman said he had
“warned Fields of the possibly em-
barrassing situation" which bad ser-
vice might rcsult in.

According to Buuman, Fields in-
structed Dean of Student Affairs
Neil BroWn to have his people clock
the bus rides. “This started yester-
day. The service got incredibly good.
you may have noticed . . . Fields got
down hard on Kopf," sttid the SA
President.

Despite the
problems apparently remained. One
bus rider said that even though the
driver of her bus had received orders
to leave ahead of schedule. because a
fire along the route had caused
delays. the driver had refused to
leave. Others told of waiting for an
overdue bus only to have a group of
seven buses urrivc. And Monroe was
pessimistic about next semester's
service: “I don‘t know what it's going
to be. like next year. with the budget
cuts."

by Susan Ii. Miller

Right now over half of SUNYA’s
dorm rooms are unlocked and un-
attended. SUNY Security Services
report that this is a conservative ex-
timate.

The monthly activity report issued
by the University Police reveals 948
criminal cases were reported at
SUNYA in 1975.

The monthly report divides
offenses into three major categories.
They are offenses against the person.
offenses against property. and mis-
cellaneous offenses.

Keith Stewart of University Police
considers crimes against the person
most serious as there is “potential

English Faculty  Cuts

by C. S. Santlno

Dean of Humanities Ruth
Schmidt's special meeting with
members of the English faculty on
Thursday evening has resulted in
what one professor calls “a widening
of the breach“ between the faculty
and the administration.

In a memo dated Feb. 3, 1976.
Schmidt invited 21 members of the
English department to meet with her
in order to “clear up some mis-
understandings” concerning ad-
ministration attempts to regain the
English Ph. D. program.

She was particularly concerned
with the f aculty's Jan. 301etter to the
ASP. “A Farewell to the English
Department?!‘ in which disapproval
was expressed with administrative
handling of the department‘s current
plight. The 21 members invited in
Schmidt‘s memo had signed the
letter.

While mourning the loss of the
Ph.D. program that was terminated
last December by Education Com-
missioner Ewald Nyquist, the letter
stated. “nevertheless. the way in
which the SUNYA Administration
has [dealt] with the problem [of the
Pb.D.] threatens the English depart-
ment . . . and what is more.
threatens the quality of un-_
dergraduate education at this un-
iversity."

The letter went on to question the
need for a traditional doctoral
program and the administration‘s
ability to effect its plans. considering
what many feel would be the high
cost of bringing back the defunct
program.

The recommendations of a report
from outside evaluators were also
criticized. The cvaluators‘ report in
essence calls for the hiring of a
separate graduate faculty at the cost

of about a half dozen junior
members.

Although Schmidt did allow in-
terested faculty besides those who
signed the letter to attend the
meeting. she refused to let the
Albany Student Press cover it. She
said that the conference was “a
private faculty fathering" and that
“the press had no business being
there." A reporter who attempted to
sit in on the meeting was asked to
leave. .

“Well. that concurs with her at-
titude about the press and publicity
in general." said one professor. Ac.
cording to him.’ Schmidt told in-
volved faculty members. “1 am upset
that you put your grievances before

the community by submitting that
letter." explainingthat she feels these
are in-house matters to be discussed
by the administration and faculty
exclusively.

Eve nts of the meeting were record-
ed by several faculty members. The
following is their account of what
took place. as told to the ASP.

Schmidt maintained that the letter
"appalled" her because it “cut the
ground out from President Fields‘
attempt to strengthen the English
department.“

“I could understandjunior faculty
members signing that letter."
Schmidt added.“but [thought those
senior faculty members had more
sense."

“She‘s slapping our wrists; telling
us not to do it again.“ said onejunior
member. “She asks us why we don't
come to her with our complaints. We
simply aren't taken seriously.
Schmidt is terribly out of touch with
