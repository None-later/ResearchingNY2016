FEBRUARY 10, 1976

 

by Maria Bueciferro

Growing up in a suburb of Belfast
in the l950's, Harry Donaghy show-
ed his younger brother the best
places for throwing rocks and
heating up Protestant schoolboys.
“The Queen‘s a bitch," they'd yell.
“The Blessed Virgin‘s a whore,”
they'd be answered.

Today. Father’Donaghy Is New-
man Chaplain at Skidmorc College.
Thursday evening he was at
SUNYA‘s Chapel House discussing
life in Northern Ireland, his home
until eight years ago.

Delivered by an American soldier
during a World War II air raid.
Donaghy and his two brothers and
three sisters grew up with hatred and
violence a way of life.

“My grandmother. when she was
38. was killed in front of my father
and her family by a British soldier
with a bayonet against the wall. for
not giving information. That story
was imprinted on our minds—we
were never allowed to forget it."

Other Catholics on his block
couldn‘t forget: “In a row of ten
homes, every one of them has had at
least one person killed in the past
eight or ten years."

The lighting in Northern Irclztnd
has been going on for much more
than ten ycars. His brother's and his
childish lighting around the revolu-
tion of I956 evolved into serious
Violence in the revolution of I967; in
relating his brother's activities.
Donaghy asked that the tape
recorder be turned off.

But the trouble began 800 years
earlier. accordingto Donaghy, when

Pope Adrian IV gave Ireland to,
England in NH. “There's been a
revolution every ten years since
II7l, with attempts in-between.
They last three or four years—~the
younger brothers get older, and must
get even." ,

While noting it‘s a tragedy the hate
is transmitted to the . young.
Donaghy criticized "American sen-
timentality“ in the media. citingthe
NBC documentary "Suffer the Little
Children” among others.

“They say how terrible it is, the lit-
tle children hearing bombs, the psy-
chological damage. The damage is
done by the time they can hear-th
hatred. the bitterness is ingrained.
But the real psychological damage is
to the Northern lreland Catholic
men; they're regarded as second-
class citizens, as scum.“

According to Donaghy, un—
employment among Catholics is 70
percent; among Protestants. 20 per-
cent. “My father's been on welfare
the last ten years. Every Monday he
and my brother go down to the
welfare office. past British soldiers
who make snide remarks, having to
take English money to live on.

“Northern Irish women run the
country. the family. The men are
withdrawn and feel like failures. The
women are the strong force in family
life. Isawadcmonstration where un-
armed women scurcd away British
soldiers; the men wouldn't. They‘re a
subculture—passive, drinking. Iow
self-image, feelingthcy don't exist——
nobodics with no self pride.“

With a situation similar to that of
the black family in America. the

  
 
  

Irish civil rights movement took
similar action. Marchers in the
streets in the I960's were attacked in
Northern Ireland and realized
change would havetocome about by
violent. not political. means. “In
I966 there were around 20 IRA
members in Northern Ireland; in
I968-9 there were thousands out of
nowhere.”

Donaghy mentioned the pressure
on his brothers and sisters to be ac-
tive in the IRA. "A normal boy over
I3 or 14, if he doesn't want tojoin.
can be encouraged, threatened. He
wants protection for his family, and
there‘s a danger he could be an
inf ormcrwthc Irish have a history of
informers."

“My tnothcr and sister were sym~
pathetic to the I7- and I8-ycar-old
British lads. I was too, till my
brother was picked up and beaten
for no reason. He had to have 20 to
30 stitches."

“Our neighborhood is official
IRA territory. When you‘re there
you‘re official, when you're
somewhere else you‘re provisional.“

Donaghy explained the different
IRA‘s. “The official [RA is an un-
derground group of Marxists and
Socialists who seek a political solu-
tion: a socialist Ireland. The
provisional IRA says Ireland must
be a united republic. not a socialist
state." The two IRA's often ﬁght
each other. And ﬁght the British to
the ﬁnish.

“An lRA guy on a mission prefers
to be killed. Their own blood istheir
biggest weapon."

Members of the two IRA‘s often

don't get along. There is some
animosity between Catholics of the
North and the South as well.
Donaghy attended a seminary in
soulhcrn Ireland ——thcre are none in
thc Northeand claims he was
treated like a second-class citizen.
“We were treated like scum there.
The way we spoke was made fun of.
we were picked on at exams—I'm
not paranoid. ‘Black Northerners'
we were called. l'vc some dctcstation
for the Republic of Ireland. as do

many Catholics in Northern Ireland.
There‘s economic. cultural
diff crcnccs.“

There are extensive economic and
cultural differences between the one
million Protestants and half-million
Catholics of the North. says
Donaghy. Five percent of the
population—wealthy English
Protestants—control the resources.
The Protestant culture is British; the
Catholic is Gaelic.
