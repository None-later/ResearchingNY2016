I have good things to say about Ursula LeGuin.
Perhaps many of you have considered visiting the
Arcltipelago'of Earthsea. the ambiguous utopia near
Urras or the snowbound cities of Winter.

Earrhrea is a trilogy of novels: A Wizard of Earrhsea.
The Tomb: of Amen, and TheFarthest Share. Her style
is lucid and ﬂowing. No appendices are necessary to
explain an efﬂuvia of characters. traditions. and places.
There's romance for the romantic. There is concrete
magic for the adept. Never. in any of the ﬁve works
mentioned in the overview. does Ursula LcGuin evoke
anythingcomplicated. Her style is ﬂawless and her plot
progressions are technically accurate.

The Farther! Share, the third book in the series. was
awarded the National Book AWard for Children in

Glass Bead Game, in that it follows the life of ti young
adept—in this case. an aspiring wizard—through the
stages of maturity until he becomes dragonlord and
bullgoose magus of all the islands of Earthsea. Roke lste
may be her answer to Hesse‘s Castalia.

The left Hand of Darkness takes place on the planet
of Winter, LcGuin's playful counterpoint to Frank
Herbert's Dunetune. The protagonist is an envoy from
a confederation of advanced planets; he ﬁnds trotthlc
elonvincingthe insane kings and hungry bureaucrats of
Winter to opendiplomatic relations and minglceultural
knowledge. Emphasis here is on depth of
characterization and skillful treatment in handling
redundant themes established early in the narrative.

The Dirpossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is about
just that. Here Mrs. LeGuin asserts a somewhat more
female viewpoint than inthe other four aforementioned
works, though she does not polarize herself all out of
proportion in some kind of bombastic frenzy. She
subtly implies the spiritual presence of a female

the dispossessed people of an exiled planet.

The home planet Urras is simlar to Earth; it's divided
into three world powers—two world powers light their

The ﬁrst chess-playing machine
was aclever hoax. It was constructed
in the late IBth century by Wolfgang
von Kempclcn. scientiﬁc adviser to
the Royal Court at Vienna. The
"'l‘urk" consisted of a dummy dress-
ed as a Turk sitting at a chess board.
operated by a strong player hidden
in the phony mechanism. A later ver-
sion, called “Ajeeb.” was built by
CA. Hopper in l868. Ajeeb had a
public performance run of over 30
years in New York operated by.
among many others. the world-class
master H.N. Pillsbury.

Dr. Claude E. Shannon of Bell
Telephone Labs built the first elec-
tronic chess automaton in 1950. it
could handle endgamcs employing
six or fewer pieces. took Iii-l5
seconds to decide on it single move
and had a randomizing feature per-
mitting the device to play any viable
move in recurrent situations. Later
attempts entailed programming ex-
tant general purpose computers to
play chess.

There are on the order of 500
million ways to play the ﬁrst three
ntoves. This fact and the computer's
inferiority in making qualitative
decisions virtually insure that a com-
Puter will never play grandmaster-
ttrength chess.

The Sumhine Boys (MGM) is the
latest in along line of Neil Simon an-
nuities for Walter Matthau (The
Odd Couple, Plaza Suite). It can un-
hesitatingly be recommended to
anyone as proof that vaudeville and
good. funny movies are not
necessarily dead yet. The story is
about two aged slapstick comedians
of the old New York school of
vaudeville comedy, who have split
up after more than forty years as a
team and are now living apart in
bitter hatred of each other.

Walter Matthau is delicioust
droll as Willy Clark. although he is
about twenty yearstoo youngforthe
part. Willy is a recognizable
stereotype diehard New Yorker who
obstinater believesthat New York is
the only place to live.

Willy‘s former partner is Al lewis,
a part originally meant for the late
Jack Benny but superbly played by
the immortal George Burns. Burns.
the last of the truly great old-time
comedians. proves that age has been
no detriment to his marvelously tim-
ed comic style; his low~key perfor-

mance is fresh and sharp. Richard
Benjamin is wonderful as Matthau'e
nervous “nephew—the agent:" ner-
vousness ll very much a part of hie

style.

The script, by Neil Simon, a‘
clever. articulate and sophisticated.
but it lacks a good price. apparently
in an effort to underscore the
poignancy of the story. And even
that fails somewhat in its attempt.

' for although Simon must have
recognized the dramatic possibilities
‘of his material, he darts in a
wisecrack and the credibility often
disappears. When you‘re Neil Simon
you don‘t take chances. As a result.
much of the movie vascillates from
silliness to bittersweet drama, and
never successfully meshes the two.
But Matthau swingsintoafewfunny
bits in the beginning. George Burns
is certainly touching, and the whole
ﬁlm is deﬁnitely worth catching.

In Celebration of
Life’s Simple Joys

by Stephen Elsenman

The spectacle of young and
energetic people engaging in theatre
is always a delight. The theatre that
can arouse the expression of youth
and reproduce it on stage is lad-
mirable. The Lab Theatre produc-
tion of “Story Theatre" wasjust such
an expression.

“Story Theatre," a collection of
dramatized myths and fables. was
originally adapted for the stagczby
Paul Sills. The Broadway version
was made memorable by the in-
dividual talents of some ﬁne co ‘ ic
actors, including Valerie Harp r.
This production of course lack‘pd

such sterling comics and
professional polish. but the cast did
a ftnejob.

Director Greg Learning kept the
players moving at all times; thee
wasn't a static moment in the pin .
The actors’ movements were sugt
and crisp. their voices rang out clea
ly. and their faces conveyedthe purit-
ty of heart of which these tales areso
much an expression.

The performance of Josep '
Zubrovich was particularly outstanli
ding. His gentle comic face and softl
voice was irresistablc. I could noﬂ
help but project him into the role 0

Puck as I watched his expressions
change and heard his voice rise and
descend. Also ﬁne was Deborah
Ottaviano whose supply of cuteness
seemed inexhaustable.

The musical background. sung
gamer by Debbie Kass. consisted
largely of folk-rock songs of -the‘
Woodstock generation; a line
oeuvre. but inappropriate and dis-
tracting here. The music tended to
call attention to itself rather than to
set the proper mood, or to illustrate
the particular scenario. 1 would have
much perferred traditional
madrigals or folk ballads.

“Story T heatre" is not drama It is
comic theatre where the emphasis is
on movements; slapstick and mime,
and the theatrical reﬂection oflifc's
simple joys. There is little subtlety,
and no need for great characterira-
tion.

If the east and company of the
SUN YA Experimental Theatre can
adapt themselves equally well to the
task of performing serious drama. all
the joys of that ancient ritual I‘the
theatre“ will be realized. It is a dif-
ﬁcult. though Worthwhile endeavor,
and one that we should follow, with
hope and expectation.
