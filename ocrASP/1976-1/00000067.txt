As for the Danes’ comeback inthe
second half, Setters explained, “We

make their forwards get rid of the

,ball— to y've it to their guards. Of

course, the guards (Welchons. es-
pecially) shot Well."

And so it's back to the drawing

Castleton Defeats S'wimmers

by Christine Bellini

The home advantage went for
naught as the Albany State Women's
Basketball team dropped their 4th

.straight game,57-40 to Castleton

Thursday. '

The starting line-up of Nancy Bar-
tle (guard), Mary Ellen Foley
(forward), Kathy Harig (forward),
Mary Ann Crotty (center) and Lisa
Greenburg (guard) entered the game
conﬁdent that the spell would be
broken.

But hopes of a home court win

‘were soon forgotten, as Albany fell

behind early.

Sue Winthrop and Mary Ann
Crotty lessened the gap by scoring
six points in the last nine seconds of

«a

the half. bringingthc score upto 26-
20 Castleton.

Returning to the court with some
added conﬁdence, the Danettes still
had hopes of taking the ball game.
But constant persistence and tight
playing by the Castleton team soon
put the thought out of the realm of
things possible.

High scorer for the ﬁfth straight
time. freshman Crotty headed
Albany‘s list with I6 points, followed
by a consistent backup from
Winthrop with 13 paints..Colgate's
Sandy Allison took the lead with is
points.

With a record of Hi, the Danettes
face Russell Sage on Tuesday at 7:00
pm. in the University gym.

  On Sports

The game is over and should betakenfor what it really was: a Division [IT1 I
team battling back from a l7 point deﬁcit to make a game out of a near

disaster against a Division I school whose team is composed of scholarship
athletes. '

Albany State has nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to regret, and should
be‘proud of the D'dnes' efforts to give their fans the type of showing Danes
rooters have come to, expect and love.

And what fans those Albany people are. How many left whenthe ﬁrst half
ended, and Albany trailed, 34-19? Not a one. Perhaps they sensed the
comeback, maybe they were stunned by the court strength Siena showed,
but, most likely, they stood, or sat. and waited our the bad,

The Dance will need all 3,200 fans again next week when Pinttsburgh
comes to town in a key State University of New York Athletic Conference
game. If Central Council, in its inf initc wisdom, can agree to hold its weekly
meeting at 6: IS pm. to enable its contingent of concerned student taxpayers
to make the opening tap. then certainly the "average" student will be there,
because, as important as the Sicna game was from a traditional standpoint, it
is the Plattsburgh game which will really count in the NCAA Tournament
race.

If anyone need beembarassed after Saturday‘s gumc;it should be the Siena
Indians and their coach, Bill Kirsch. The Indians almost blewa I7 point lead
against a Division III school. and coming from a team which often grumbles
about playing “inferior” Albany, the impetus to terminate the annual affair
seems dubious in its value, both psychologically and financially.

The fact of the matter is that, like it or not. Sienn is not exactly ﬁllingtheir
Alumni Recreation Center. In fact, it has been ﬁlled to capacity exactly four
times since its completion last year: twice against Albany State. and twice
against Manhattan.

And what would WAST-TV's Dave Smith have to dump on if he could not
criticize the Albany crowd as the “most obscene" in history. of course Mr.
Smith will deny ever using any type of profanity, and we all know that such
vocabulary isunknown at Siena, where an Albany fan was told it was too bad
she was not burned with the rest of her people. Forget the annual “State
sucks" or “Albany eats shit" chants; they are probably transfer students from
State trying to stir up trouble and give the angelic Sicna lriben bad name.

It is most important that both sides of the fences get the same fertilizer; to
criticize the.State crowd is cheap and unfair, when not coupled with similar
remarks about the equally obscene few from Sicna.

Yet such treatment can be expected when one considers the source.

Returning to the topic of embarrassment. certainly Bill Kirsch of Siena
must not have looked favorable upon the lovely display under the Northern
basket in University Gym. Yes, it was quite funny. and perhaps true, but it did
show little taste.

However. when one recalls a recent pro-Sicna sign showing Doc Sauers‘
head on the body of a pig, one can only say “lt'sjust another chapter in the
history of a great. great rivalry."

And it is.

lf Albany State wins its remaining
four State University of New York

Danes will present their veteran

teams show 5-l marks). Plattsburgh

tramural Ofﬁce. 355. or Dennis
Elkin's Ofﬁce. 356, both in the Cam-
pus Center.

answer written questionaire con-
sisting of approximately 100
questions. The top three scores will

will he in n game-show form and

open to the public . . . questions

Odds are Oneonta will be tested
only once, at Plattsburgh, and that
comes at a time when the race may
well be over.

If Albany beats Plattsburgh, the
Cardinals will be virtually
eliminated because even a season-
ending win over Oneonta would
leave them with 2 losses. .

The most likely tie would be three
ways: Oneonta. Albany. and
Plattsburgh, and would occur if
Albany loses one more game,
Plattsburgh loses to Albany and
then beats Oneonta. Should that oc-
cur, the Danes would get the crown
because Albany will have beaten the
Cardinals and Red Dragons.
