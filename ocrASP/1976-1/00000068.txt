 ;Minded Albany.- SWAG Race Resumes Taniorraw

byMlke Plakarsbl

They kept coming and coming.
and tothe standing room only crowd
assembled at University Gym. it
seemed only a matter of time before
the Great Danes would pull it out—
as they had‘done so many times in
the past.

But for the upset-minded Albany
hoopsters. this miracle was not to be
as the cross-town rival Siena In-
dians. held on in the waning
moments of the game to post a 66-58
victory Saturday night in an
emotion-packed thriller.

Trailing by ﬁfteen. at the half.
the Danes kept ﬁghting back in the
second'mnas. ﬁnally owing the
lead to seven with 2:23 remaining on
Kevin Keane's basket. Seconds later
Albany recovered a loose ball and
the crowd, sensing a comeback. let
out a mighty roar. But an offensive
foul by Bob Audi after a missed
Winston Royal shot stifled the
Danes' ﬁnal rally.

Indian coach Bill Kirsch explain-
ed the game simply: “We played our

game in'the ﬁrst half and'they

[Albany] made us play their game in‘

the second.“

The difference being. of 'course.
that Siena played their game (fast-
breaking, run-and-shoot) better
than Albany played its game (con-
trolled offense and good shooting).

In fan. the ﬁrst half was a night-
mare for the host Danes. Missing
shots of every variety. the Danes
were at the mercy of Siena‘s reboun-
ding corps of six-foot eight inch
Steve Raczynski. six-foot six inch
Gary Holle. and six-foot ﬁve inch
Steve Walters.

It was the “smallest” of the “Big
Three." however. who stole the show
in that ﬁrst half. Walters hauled
down II rebounds in those twenty
minutes. and scored ten points.

But oddly enough, it was the
Danes who got off to a roaringstart.
After Raczynski won the opening
tip. Walters missed on two short
jumpers before Albany gained con-
trol. With Mike Suprunowicl
leading the attack in place of the in-

Pop Rally Nips Siena, 85-80

by David lavy

Staton Winston came off the.

bench and a four-week layoff to
score 23 points and lead the Albany
State Junior Varsity Basketball team
to a come-from-behind 85-80 victory
over Siena at Univenity Gym on
Saturday night.
Terry Miles. playing perhaps his
' ﬁnest game of the season. joined
Winston in rallying the Danes from
their 36-33 halftime deﬁcit. Winston
only this week had the cast removed
from his wrist.

Coach Bill Austin's squad tried a
zone press which Siena riddled by
effectively using their towards to
move the ball upcourt. This allowed
the Indians to grab an early lead. A
major factor in the contest was the
loss to Siena of 6’2” j umping forward

 

Tony Watson to early foul trouble.
Combined with the ﬁne play of
State's John Grabowski. Albany was
thus able to control the backboards
and with them, the game.

The Danes' defensive perfor-
mance was also a key to the win. as
the team. abandoning the press" and
employing a drop-back zone,limited
the run-and-gun lndiansto IS points
below their season average. Guard
Mickey Mahoney and six-foot ﬁve-
inch John Murray paced the Siena
scoring.

State's second-half surge sent
them to 9-l on the season while the
Indians dropped to 7-6. The team ef-
fort saw ﬁve men hit doubleﬁgures.

The Pups next game is Wednesday
at Hudson Valley Community
College.

~ x The action to teat-paced In the too-yard freestyle mm at Unlvenlty

Pod. Albania Paul Marshman emerged vletortous.

jured Gary Trevett, the Danes work- I

ed the ball around nicely until Brian
Barker connected on a foul line
jumper, bringing the partisan crowd
to its feet with a rafter-shaking cheer.

They could not know it at the
time, but that 2-0 lead was to be
Albany‘s only one of the night.
Holle‘s two free throws and
succeeding jumper put Siena on top,
4-2. with a minute and a half gone in
the game before Albany‘s Vic Cesare
popped in it IS footer from the side
to tie the score.

That's when the roof caved in on
the Danes. When Walters tapped in
a missed Wayne Meyer shot on the
next play. the Indians began an un-
answered fourteen point run. A Tim
Welchons layup. two quick buckets
by Walters. and suddenly it was 12-4.
Two more unanswered baskets by
the Indians put a hush over the
crowd before Barry Cavanaugh‘s
turnaround jumper brought them
once more to life.

!But there was no stopping thc
visitors. With Holle and Walters
dominating the boards. Siena was
able to get the most out of its fast-
breaking techniques to run up the
score. When Raczynski literally
reached over Audi for an offensive
rebound and hoop to give the In-
dians a 24-6 lead. it looked like it was
all over for the Danes.

“I was afraid we were going to get
blown out." said Cesare. But such
was not to be the case.

Getting only one shot at the hoop
and having to contend with an
aggressive man-to—man defense. the
Danes were lucky even to cut the
lead to 34-19 at intermission.

And it wassub Steve Macklin who
did the chopping at the end. With
Siena holding its biggest lead at 34-

Swimmers Whip Oswego, 64-48 1

by Brian 0rol

The Albany State varsity swim-
ming team defeated Oswego Sutur-
duy at University Pool 64-48 in a
meet marred by the walkout of the
Oswcgo swimmers. led by their
conch Bob Murray.

The walkout came in reaction to
the disqualification of Gary Wood.
an Oswego “diver.” Couch Murray
placed Wood in the three meter div-
ing event. ignoring the fact that
Wood is not a diver. and would not
be able to execute the various rou-
tines required of a three-meter diver.

The ﬁrst round of three-meter
dives required Wood to do a front
dive. He did a reasonable facsimile.
but scored rather poorly.

The second dive was a reverse dive
with certain cxtrn complications.
Wood was totally in the dark about
what was expected forthe dive. After
pacing back and forth along the div-
lng board a few time. heuhrugged his
shoulders, walked to the front of the
board and. instead of diving.
JUMPED OFFI

At this point Albany Couch Ron
White requested the ofﬁcial to dis-'
qualify Wood, for reasons of
“Wood's personal safety." The of-

not before Albany's Mike Supronowlc: (34) commits the tout.

IS. Macklin reported in for Barker
and immediately made things
happen. In the course of 8] seconds.
Macklin: popped in a l7footjumper
from the side. stole a Welchons pass.
muscled in a basket after pulling
down an offensive rebound. and
picked off another rebound from the
defensive boards. But the poor
shooting (9 for 36) in the half proved
to be the Danes‘ undoing.

The second half was another
story. as Albany came out like a ball
of fire. Cavanaugh‘s two free throws
and turnaround jumper from seven
feet out the gap to ll. Then. after
Walters made two foul shots,
Suprunowicz connected on a long-
range swish and Cavanaugh con-
verted a jumper to make it 36-27 with
fifteen minutes left. _

The next ten minutes were evenly
played with Siena outscoring
Albany by an “MS mary‘n. But the
hero for the Indians in this stretch
was not one of the “Big Three," but
rather. guard Tim Welchons.
Welchons tallied l2 of the Siena

ﬁcial complied with White's request
and disqualiﬁed Wood. citing a rule
which says in part. “a diver must
make a serious attempt at every dive
or may be disqualiﬁed."

After the disqualiﬁcation of
Wood. Oswcgo Coach Murray
protested to the ofﬁcial. but the deci-
sion remained. The diving event was
completed and before the ﬁnal relay
could be held. Conch Murray led his
team into the dressing room. He
could not be reached for comment
later.

The walkout almost diverted
attention from the comeback victory
of the Danes. After capturing one
out of the first ﬁve events. the Danes
went on to win seven of the remain-
ing eight.

The Dunes took the lead. 36-34.
on the I00 yard freestyle with Paul
Marshmun's winning time of 0:5l.6.
Albany's lead was increased to4l-3li
with Dave Rubin capturing ﬁrst in
the backstroke with a personal best
of 2:l6.4.

The score was evened at 44 apiece
when Kurt Vanderbogart. a winner
in all three of his events. wonthe 500
yard freestyle. His time was 5:20 ﬂat.
The Danes surged back into the lead

 

   

     

points in that span and thoroughly .
amazed the crowd with his swishes

   

from all over the court. And with .

4: l3 remaining, his team now led 59- t
45 ‘

But Albany was not through.
Audi popped from I7 feet. Barker
snared one from ten. Cavanaugh hit
a free throw. Keane converted a
rebound, and suddenly. amazingly.
the Danes were back in it as the .
crowd’ roared and pounded each ,
other. 1‘

But just as suddenly as they had
gained it. Albany saw its momentum
turn the other way as Siena rattled
off the next six points. Raczynski‘s
offensive rebound and layup with ‘
1:36 left gave Siena an insurmoun- i
table ll-point lead and decided
everything except the ﬁnal score.

It was Welchons who emerged as
the high scorer with 22 points on 9 p
out of 14 fromthe ﬁeld. It wasjust“a -
hot night.” he said. “I hit mostly
open shots." Siena. as a whole. con-
nected on 47.|% of its shots while

to stay. 52-45. when Jeff Cohen un- .
expectedly won the 200 yard V
breastroke, and Jack Seidcnbcrg.
also of Albany, placed second.

The following event was the con- ,‘

troversial three-meter dive, in which >’
Arthur Rosenberg won with a point ‘
total of I79.25. and Gary Wood of ‘
Oswego was disqualiﬁed. The vic- '
tory in the diving clinched the meet
for the Danes. The ﬁnal event was
the 400 yard freestyle relay won by V
Albany. .
“Swimming is a very strategic '
sport." said White after the meet. 5
"We had three strategies to choose ’
from and ended up choosing to .
'throw‘ the medley relay while ‘

“It was a team effort. we put the '
pieces of the panic together. Ifelt it
would come down to the last relay. I

New News is Good News" '3

For a student government to be an effective agent for change, it
must have a channel for communication to both the students it
represents and the other people it hopes to influence.

The need for a student voice can not be met by the ASP ,whose:
reaponsibility is tojournalism ﬁrst and student needs second. In fact,
the ASP is more accurately a campus newspaper than a student one.
The purpose of out of the SAndbox is to fill the void; to make certain
that student opinion does not go unheard.

Furthér, it is our opinion that the news media creates the news.
Events are not news until they are brought to the public‘s attention.
Many an incident we felt was important has gone unreported by the
existing campus media. The broader that this paper will provide will

I expose a more varied picture of activity to the students.

We will f unctionto inform you of services you maybe overlooking,
as Well as extracurricular activities you may not know about. We will
seek to make our events calendar as comprehensive as possible so that
everyone can partake of the multitude of activities your tax money is
providing. _

This is an in-house organ and the opinions herein represent the
View of the Student Association.

wé don‘t want to compete with the ASP. WSUA or the Tower
Tribune or any other campus media. We hope to compliment the
work of our brother and sister media.

What’s in a name?

'01:! of the SAntlbox. Well. at least We don't take ourselves too
seriously. Sometimes the issues are real. but most of us will agree that
much of our involvement is of a gamelike nature and that “sandbox
politics“ reflects accurately the situation. In out of the SAndbox. we
put forth the double entendre and leave you to choose the meaning
that fits your image of SA. J

Are we in the sandbox and merely reporting out of it of are we
maturing (crawling out of the sandbox) or even already out?

We don‘t care. We realize that over concern with image Can only
slow down accomplishment. We‘re not taking ourselves too seriously
'either. Give us a chance.

Editorial   .  .1 

by Bryant Monroe

Anyone w uses the-‘busses
here at SUNY can tell you that
the bus service has been erratic.

When intersession ended and we ‘

returned to school, we dis-
covered, much to our dismay,
that the bus service had been cut.
This cut from an inadequate ex-
isting schedule wastoo much for
students to take.

It became impossible to make
a 9:45 or I0:00class without leav-
ing at least an hour early.This
was the situation until last
Wednesday. February 4. Onthat
morning. there were extra busses
at 9:40 and 9:45. plus other
busses at various times before.
These extra busses made it possi-
ble to get to class while leaving
only a half hour before class!_

Changes ‘Made

' There were a number of fac-
tors which may have lead tothis
sudden change of pace. First,
after a series of meetings with ad-

ministrators (all of which were

fruitless.) Alumni Quad Board

decided to act. They decided to .

initiate a tw0-pronged attack.

They would immediately start a
phone campaign in which all
relevant administrators would be
called andtold of the problem by
as many students as could be
mobilized. Also. statistics would
be takento discover what the real
bus schedule was. that is. what
times the busses really come.
what time they're scheduled to
come.
Field Concerned

have helped was Andy Bauman's

F.S.A. News

by Rick Meeklel‘

One of the most potentially
powerful] changes of this
academic year has been the
restructuring of the F.S.A. (now
U.A.S.) to a student dominated
board of directors. While the
new Board of Trustees guidelines
appear to threaten that position.
student leaders see this latest
ploy as just another obstacle in
obtaining a rcsposive food ser-
vice. ’

As some of you may recall, the
.entire question of control
developed over last year's board
increase. Condemned by Student
Association'as unnecessary. it
angered various segments of the
student body into pushing for
various F.S.A. reforms. When
those efforts appeared un-
successful. the undergraduate
students then simply joined
forces with the graduate students
and voted in a student slate of

corporate officers and directors. '

Resistance to this move crime
from both administration, f acul-
ty and even some student circles.

Gains Seen

However. in light of the
positive aspects that have
resulted from actions taken by
Board (lower bnr prices. a food
co-op.etc.) as well as with regard
to the now released information
that showed the board increase
totally unnecessary. student con-
trol appears desirable.

Recent issues that are coming
to the Directors in which all
students should be concerned in-
clude: -

I. the complete renovation of the
rathskellar

2. the possibility of a board
decrease

3. the sale of Mohawk Campus
(now being studied by a F.S.A.
priorities committee)

4. a planned return of the $|00.-
000 in excessive proﬁts made on
board contracts (various plans
are being considered by the some
priorities committee).

If you have any ideas or com-
plaints about theese or other ma-
jor F.S.A. issues please contact
one of your student represen-
‘tativcs. Their names are :Andy
Bauman.Stu Klein. Eric Kuehn.
Greg Lessne, Rick Meckler.
Warren McLean, lay Miller.
Ellen Sinreich. Ellen Stopsky.
David Gold. and David Coyne.

Board meetings well be held
on alternate Wedncday's at 3: is.
Appropriately enough for the
first time all directors-
administration. faculty. and
students will eat dinner in one of
the cafeterias on the campus
following the.meeting.

visity with President Fields.
After Fields was made aware of
student grieVances concerning

the busses, he seemed concerned. .

It's hard to say why the busses
are now arriving on time. All we
do now is hope that they keep on
coming. If not, some serious ac—
tion will have to be taken.
