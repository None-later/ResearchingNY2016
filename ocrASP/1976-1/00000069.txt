News Release form SASU

Serious planning for state-
wide student opposition to the
proposed SUNY budget beganat

,a Political and Financial Issues

Conference held by the Student
Association of the State Univer-
sity of New York (SASU) at the
SUNY Binghamton campus
Feb. 6-7. v

A three-phase program was
designed to educate, organize
and mobilize students to prevent
tuition increases and to make
more money available for public
higher education in New York
State. A mass demonstration
was scheduled for March 16 at
the Capitol in conjunction with
the City University of New York
Student Senate. SASU is seeking
the support of other education-
related groups and labor unions
in an attempt to form a coalition
against the proposed budget.

Students will lobby with
legislators in their home district
ofﬁces up until the SASU
legislative Conference, March

around the state will gather for
two days' of meetings with
legislators. The mass demonstra-
tion will occur on the final day of
the conference.

Local .campus actions are

planned for Feb. 18, to express

student opposition to hikes in
tuition and room rent charges.
The specific actions are to be
determined by each campus.
Letter-writing campaigns, aimed
at legislators, were organized at
the Workshop.

Oppose Tuition Hikes

The letter-writing, local cam-
pus demonstrations, lobbying
and the mass demonstration are
designed to maintain pressure on
legislators to revise the SUNY

also met to discuss issues which
they are facing this year.
Student members of campus
FSAs met to discuss new FSA
guidelines adopted by the SUNY
Board of Trustees in December.
The FSA corporations, which
provide food, bookstore and
other auxilary services on, cam-
pus, have been changed from
representative to individual
membership corporations. This
will permit students, faculty ahd
administrators to join the cor-

poration as individuals. If
enough students join the cor-
poration, they will dominate the
membership and be able to
change the lay-laws to insurethat
students are adequately
represented in these cor-
porations which affecttheir daily
lives.

A number of campus represen-
tatives laid the groundwork for
local organization of astate-wide
student voter educaiton and
registration campaign. Given a
high priority by the SASU
membership, this drive seeks to
register thousands of students to
strengthen their voice in this
year‘s elections and in student
lobbying efforts. Local coor-
dinators will be working with
SASU on the state-wide project,
and SASU is workingin conjun-
citon with Vote ’76, a national
voter registration project.

Student government
treasurers held a semi-annual

meeting to exchange informa- ’

tion and talk about the issues and
procedures which they deal with
on campus. An analysis of stu-
dent government budgets was
distributed and reviewed by the
treasurers.

A Student Assembly meeting
was scheduled to hear the report
of a special investigatory cont-
mittee, established in December
to look into allegation of ﬁscal
mismanagement. Lack of _ a
quorum prevented the presenta-

‘ What the'hell is Central Coun-
cil. anyway? It sounds like the
leadership of the communist par-
\ty or something. In reality, its

, nothing quite that exciting. As

the legislative branch of Student
Association, CC is responsible
for all typically legislative func-
tions within the Association.
This includes the funding of
almost 100 groups through the
disbursement of half almillion
dollars in mandatory activity fee
money, the establishment of
policies and procedures for the
regulation of the organization
itself and the groups funded by it,
and the issuance of position
statements of concern to the stu-
dent body.

Council members are elected
by living area' in ratio of one
represetative for every 300
students(or the nearest whole
thereof). Three fourths of the
Council is elected in the spring
and the remaining one fourth is
elected in the fall. The elections
being held this coming week are
to replace those people who have
resigned. The Council elects
from its own membership, a
chairperson and a vice chairper-
son. I have the dubious pleasure
of holding the former position.

The Council has eight stan-
ding committees that are ad-
visory to the Council. All legisla—
tion must go through committee
before it can cometo the Council
floor. Virtually all legislation
that comes through committee
passes the Council. Committee
membership is open to all tax-
paying students and although
some committees are full, the
majority still have room for more
interested people willing to give
up a couple of hours a week to
lend their expertise orjust plain
energy to addressing problems
facingstudents. A list ofthe com-
mittees and their respective
responsibilities follows:
Academics Committee—deals
with the administration and un-
iverstiy governance structure in
areas of academic affairs in-
cluding course and teacher
evaluation, tenure, grading
policy,promotion, academic re-
quirements and academic
priorities (resource allocation).
Administration and Auxiliary
Services~deals with the
registrar, the bursar, bus servie ,
linen contracts, ref rigerator con-

Athletic Finance Committee-—

adjustments of the intercollegiat
athletics budget, -

WSUA: Music

Specials

by Paul Rosenthal

While the normal fare of music
onWSUA, Albany State‘s campus
radio station, includes styles ranging
from classical to jazz, ther are several
shows to keep special eye on. I

Two of the interesting programs
are the WSUA Specials. Every Mon-
day at 8 p.m., Music Director Bill
Castle hosts the "Album of the
Week" show. A new recording from
tlte'world of music is debuted for
WSUA’s listening audience. Usual-
ly, llill airs an albumjust recentlyin-
troduced to the market. The

' program is co-hostcd by Matt Kauf-

man.

Tuesdays at 8, Mike Barr presents
the “Artist ofthe Week“ program. A
group or individual recording artist
is featured for th 3—hour program.
Mike typically fills the listeners in on
little-known facts about the week's
artist. ‘

Both ofthe WSUA Specials add a

this Week

special attraction: free give-away-

albums' offcrred to listeners who call
up at the right time. The Request-
Line number is 457-3717. Records
are provided through the courtesy of
local distributors.

Perhaps thc'most popular music
special on the Sporty‘640, however,
isthe Saturday Night ofGold. Thisis
a program that goes back several
‘ years on WSUA. The host is Glen
Trotincr, along. with several other
talented D.J.‘s. The show begins at
11 pm. and lasts into the wee hours
of Sunday morning. Requests can be
made on the WSUA Request Line.
Often special artists are featured on
this program as well. The now-
famous Good-Night Linc can be
reached at 457-6443. Listeners can
call up and record a “good night"
message 01 tltc person of their
choice. .

These and others are the special
shows that make WSUA the Cam-
pus Mindcd Radio Station.
