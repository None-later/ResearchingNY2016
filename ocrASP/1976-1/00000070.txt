Telethon ’76:
' In Full Swing

by Susan ltzkowltz

Some uugnt say it's that time
again. Telethon time. but in actuality
it’s been Telethon time since our ﬁrst
bake sale. pumpkin and jelly apple
sale. Basketball Marathon, and
Thanksgiving dance. You see. this
Albany tradition is not limited to 24
hours in March. The Telethon'staff.
with the help of a large following in
the student body work arduoosly
through the entire school calendar in
an attempt to present a substantial
check to the Wildwood School an-
nually. ,

This year‘s Telethon tells what
Telethon is all about, the children.
Our theme itself. “Look to the
Children”. magniﬁes this point; For
Telethon is' not an excuse to avoid
studying or self-gratify those who

 

- run- it, but is is rather a gesture

towards those who need our help.
it's a mo‘ney making scheme which
helps provide the much needed funds

Our methods for raising money
are very painless and hopefully even
pleasant. We try to provide the
Albany campus with events they will
enjoy and times they won't soon
forget.

in the upcoming future we have
scheduled a Pinaball Tournament. a
Bagel Sale with real bagels and a
Bake Sale. We are also planning on
collecting donations at the Siena
game, and are receiving the money
frdm this semester‘s Food Fast on
Februai'y 18. T-shirts in all colors
and Telethon buttons are also soon
to go on sale. Lastly on our agenda is
Telethon itself on March l9 & 20 at
which time we hopcto seeall of you.

SUNYA‘s nursing program may
be endangered, according to faculty
and students in that school. as the
Presidential Task Force on
Priorities prepares its report on
where cuts should be made.

A report on Task Force
recommendations is expected
around February 23. a release date
which nursing program ofﬁcials say
may serve to minimize student reac-
tion as the university prepares to
break for vacation. Seniors Karen
Thompson and Kris Mcslcr are
organizing a student task force in
preparation for what they believe
will be a negative report.

Thompson says. "it‘s fairly ob—
vious fora number for factors." “The
[master‘s program] feasibility study
made up my mind that nursing was
in trouble," said Meslcr. Thompson

Nursing School I Endangered

and Mesler point out that a major
criticism of the nursing school has
been that it is exclusively un-
dergraduate.

last year's Select Committee on
Priorities recommended that
SUNYA‘s nursing program be dis-
continued unless it begun a master‘s
degree program. According to
Thompson, a committee met in
November to “assess the need for a
graduate nursing program in
Albany. The initial response was
favorable." Russell Sage currently
offers the only master's program in
the area but has oriented itself
toward teaching degrees. “A
January committee meeting was
postponed to February 9," Thomp-
son continucd. “and now we‘ve been
told that further meetings have been
postponed indeﬁnitely."

Dr. Philip Sirotkin. Vice Presi-

 

dent for [Academic Affairs. said that

.shortly after the ﬁrst feasibility

meeting, SUNYA received notice of
its budget cutbacks. Sirotkin said
that it would be hard tojustify the
expense of adding a nursing masters
program. while asking others to cut
back.

Thompson believes that “the nut-
sing schooi's whole future hinged on
a graduate program. And we were
told that the naming of a new dean
would impose on the [masters]
feasibility study." Dr. Dorothy Ma-
jors. then dean of the Nursing
School, announced her intention of
resigning her position July. 1974.
Thompson said a search to ﬁnd a
new dean was not begun until
February 1975 as “we wcretoidthcrc
were too many searches—for a presi-
dent. and a Dean of Arts and
Sciences—at one time.”

 
  

 

        
 
      

  
 
  
   
  
   
  
 
    

There are strong indications that these students from SUNVA'e
School of Nursing will be hurt by extendve budget cuts.

The search committee. headed by
interim dean Richard Myren. sub-
mitted three names for President
Ficlds‘ consideration in July. 1975.

Council Queries Bauman On SASU Corruption

 

SA President Andy leutnen st Centrd Council Wednesday: “The
politics that have touched SASU have touched this organization."

Inside Job Suspected In SA Cash

by CS. Ssntlno

SA employees may be responsible
for the theft of over $200 from the
Student Association Contact Ofﬁce,
according to SA Controller Stu
Klein.

chin. addressing the Central
Council Wednesday night. said he
discovered last week that some Con-
tact Ofiicc cash boxes were missing
up to $150.

“llccuusc access to the office is so
litnitcd and only small amounts were
taken.“ suid SA Vice President Rick
Mccklcr. “we suspect our own peo-
ple." Mccklcr is responsible for the
office. “There is no evidence of a
break in.“ hc uddcd.

“Wc realized we had been robbed
when it came time to pay our bills."

said Mecklcr. On February 4. a
representative from Hudson Valley
Community College came to collect
money from the Contact Office‘s sale
of Orleans concert tickets totalling
$260. Only $180 was found in the
cash box. The missing $60 was paid
out of student tax money.

The Contact Office also sells
Greyhound Bus tickets. When
Greyhound came to collect. $l50
was missing. Greyhound too. was
paid from student tux funds.

Mlsplscement Considered

“Naturally. we thought we had
misplaced the cash," suid Mecklcr,
“ but when we checked the other cosh
boxes. We kncw we'd been robbed."
The Contact Office has a number of
different cosh accounts. including

"The ends are not tied up in our
Student Association right now." said
SA President Andy Bauman shortly
before he met with Central Council
in a four-und-a~half hour executive
session Wednesday night to discuss
reports of corruption in the Student
Assembly.

Although the corruption is'

rumored to involve scvcralthousand
dollars. SASU/Student Assembly
President Bob Kirkpatrick says it is
“absolutely” under 5 1000. “ People i it
our office have stretched some
rules." be said. “We are discussing it
right now with the univcrsitijUN Y
officials]."

Baumun was it member of u Stu-
dent Assembly cornmittcc in-
vestigating alleged corruption and
mismanagement. Titpcs that record-
ed commiitcc evidence and
testimony were burned by ilaumnn
to protect confidentiality.

Several Council mcmbcrs. upset
by being left in the dark, risked
Bauman to fully explain the SASU
situation. He agreed to do so but
only under the veil of executive ses-
sion. Council look 45 minutes to
decide to go into executive session.
In nncxccutivc session. only Council

various concert ticket sales. "None
of these appear to have been touch—

Losses Not Reported

The losses. which are not insured.
were not reported to security
“hccuusc wefch we should deal with
our own employees and the amount
taken was relatively insigniﬁcant."
said Mcckler.

in odditionto these recent losses, a
sum of about $40 was pilfcrcd from
the third floor SA ofﬁce last
semester. which bringsthc totul theft
ﬁgure to about $250. SA decided to
move its cash to the Contact Office
(which opened earlier this year) due
to the vulnerability ofthc busythird

members and selected ofﬁcials are
permitted to remain in the meeting
room. in addition to Council
members, Bauman. S'A Vice Presi-
dent Rick Mcckicr and SASU
. Delegate linda Kuboolian were pre-
sent at Wednesday‘s session.

Before the session began. Bauman
told Council that he wanted to reveal
what he could about SASU, and said
he was upset that a “tense at-
mosphere" existed in SA. He said.
"The politics that have touched
SASU have touched this organiza-
tion.“

The politics that bch touched
SASU/Student Assembly revolve
around an internal power struggle
which resulted in the ouster of Vice
President lictty l’ohanku. Ping-
pongcd corruption allegations
prompted the Strident Assembly to
investigate.

Kirkpatrick said. “Malicious
rumors have splashed across the
state in the past month. with the ob-
'vious intent of none other than dis-
crcditing our lcudcrship and causing
tremendous destruction within our
organization.“

In a telephone interview yester»
day. Kirkpatrick admitted that some

Box Theft

When the Contact Office opened
for business. a staff of about 14
“hand picked people" were hired.
But Mcckicr suspects some of his
employees tnuy be walking off with
morcthun their $2.25 an hour salary.

“We couldn't have picked a
straighter crew. I had a lot offaithin
these people. I have it lot less now,"
said Mcckler.

Mcckler reported that all the peo-
ple involved were interviewed in-
dividually and all were incredulous.
None could volunteer any informa-

on.

Asked if anybody has been ﬁred,
Mccklcr responded. “Not yet." lie
feels there is the possibility of
someone else being responsible.
though he has no idea who.

An appointment has not yet been
made and one candidate has since
withdrawn from consideration.

Sirotkin said that the university
was interested in one very qualiﬁed
candidate b.‘ that she wished to
know the status of the Nursing
School before accepting the
positiotd Such status'will in part be
determined by the Task Force report
February 23

Nursing School‘s high cost per
student and lower student-to-
teuchcr ratio than most other
SUNYA programs have been
offered as further nursing draw-

backs. With an enrollment of 284
students and l4 faculty, eleven are
full-time instructors. a lower ratio
docs often occur. But Thompson
stressed this is for safety reasons and
only occurs in a clinic situation.

He said. “ Each patient is under the
license of the instructor and that
often means responsibility for 16~20
patients [students frequently care
for two patients each in clinic]."
Clinical experience is begun in the
first semester of the sophomore year
at such places as St. Peters Hospital.
the Child‘s Hospital. and the Capital
District Psychiatric Center.

A $300,000 yearly budget comes
from the nature of such a
professionally oriented program.
This sum has been reduced by $l36,-
000 in faculty grants since 1972.

Rosemary O'Neill. Co-ordinator
of Communications for the New
York State Nurscs Association has
said that closing the SUNYA nur-
sing program would rcpresent “a
step backward” and result in “a
potentially tragic situation in this
area." Sirotkin said “I think they've
overestimated. There are other
programs in the area [Skidmore and
Russell Sage] and i believe Skid-
more does have the capacity to take
in some more people."

Many nursing students have said
that they would not be ablcto afford
a private nursing school. Sage‘s tui-
tion and fees are $2.740 per year as
