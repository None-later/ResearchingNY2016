. MONA’S VOICE ~'

Believe it or not. the famous Mona
Lisa painting by Leonardo Da Vinci
now has a voice.

A team of Japanese computer ex-
perts, intrigued by the famous pain-
ting, recently spent weeks taking
measurements of the Mona Lisa's
cranial structure, her throat and.
facial featuresf'and other features,
and other parts of her famous torso.

All of this was fedintoacomputer
which then “reconstituted” what
Mona Lisa's voice probably sounded
like. A tape-recording of the nearly
500-year-old Mona has been turned
over to the Chateau where Leonardo
lived and died. Visitors to the
muaeum can hear her say in part: "I
am Elisabeth. called Mona Lisa. I
was born in Florence."

The voice is said to be soft, and

     

   

  

PLANT SUICIDE -
A University of Michiganscientist
who last year discovered that plants
commit suicide, now says he knows
how the plants kill themselves-—
although he doesn't know why.
Professor Larry Nooden, studying
under a Department of Agriculture
Research grant, says he found that
plants that want to end it all release
what he calls a “KillerHormone.” He
says the killer hormone spreads
throughout the plant, causing a
color change and eventual death.
Nooden says the killer hormone
appears usually atthe time the plants
begin to ﬂower or develop pods.

CHILD LIB

A University of Maryland study
has found that many children's
books contain not just racism and
sexism — but also numerous in-
stances of “agism.”

The study by the University of
Maryland Center on Aging recently
examined 549 children's books’and
found that only I6 percent of them
portrayed any elderly characters
who spoke more than just one line of
dialogue.

LIVING JELL-O

A Canadian medical researcher
reports that he attached 23 elec-
trodes'to a bowl of lime .Iell-O and
succeeded in picking up recordings

off by the human brain.

Doctor Adrian Upton of Mac-
. Master University in Hamilton. 0n-
tario, says that the portion of .IelI-O
involved was about the size of a
human brain.

Upton stresses that the lime JeII-O
was not doing any thinking. He says
the apparent brain waves from the
gelatin dessert resulted from various
artificial feeding machines and
respirators that were operating next
to the JclI-O. causing it to vibrate.

Upton explains the tests Were con-
ducted to show doctors that E. 5.0.
brain wave readings can be decep-
' tivc, particularly when conducted on
persons in comas who are attached
I to various artificial life support

   
 

   

of wave activity similar to that given.

The Senate Selea'cemmittee on
Intelligence reports that one word
which wu completely absent from
the C.I.A.'s glossary of dirty tricks
was the word ASSASINATION.

According to a I96I C.I.A.
notebook. words such as “TER-
MINATING" or“ELIMINATING"
were used instead. Other acceptable
terms. according to agency
documents. were "IN-
CAPACITATING" or conducting
an “EXECUTIVE ACTION"
against various "TARGETS."

A committee set up inside the
C.I.A. to oversee possible assassina-
tion plots was known as “THE
HEALTH ALTERATION COM-
MITTEE."

According to the Senate report.
that Committee once orderedthat an
Iraqi Colonel be permanently “IN-
CAPACITATED." Beforethe order
was carried out. the “HEALTH
ALTERATION COMMITTEE"
aeceivcd a report back from a field
agent that the Iraqi was already“IN-
CAPACITA'I‘ED". that he had
“Suffered a tcminal illness before a
firing squad in Baghadud."

MONSTER FOODS - a

Now that several leading-kitish
scientists have concluded the fabled
Loch Ness Monster is living in the
waters of Scotland, a Chicago
researcher claims he has discovered
what Nessie and her fellow ﬂint
creatures have been dining on. -,

 

Roy Mackal. a biochemist at the
University of Chicago, says that the
monsters of the deep have been fill-
ing themselves up with young
salmon swimming into the Ness area
to breed.

Mackal calculates that there are
68,000 tons of young salmon for
Nessie and her friends to eat-—
hundreds of times more food than is
needed to keep them lit. he says.
