by a correspondent

There can be no denyingthat thc situa-
tion at the university is alarming. A
presidential priorities committee is charg-
ed with the responsibility of recommen-
ding which programs at the university
should be ellminatedto meet the stringent
demands of the Governor‘s budget.

Coming shortly after the demise ofthe
Allen Center and the astronomy
program, the university now faces the
prospect that by the end of this academic
year more than 40 faculty positions will
have fallen under the budget ax since last
summer. The actual impact of these
faculty cuts on undergraduate and
graduate programs will remain unclear
for some time. Yet the fearis widespread
that the university is floating on a
boundless and bottomless sea and that to
keep afloat is now the most urgent task.

The question thus arises more insistent-
ly then cvcr: what is the immediate objec-
tive of the president for the university?
And when it is reached, whcrc do we go
from there?

Obviously. the faculty should not he
the first to cast a ston‘ at the President's
efforts. Ovcr th'c ycnrs they have been un-
ztblc to shouldcr rcsponsibilitlcs for the
entire univcrsity, caught in thc tangled
web of dcpnrtmcnt and division rivalries
that have obscured broader perspectives.
The Sctnttc has slowly lust what little in-
i'lucncc it had uvcr university affairs.
whilc thc union has stood guard for in-
dividual gricvzmccs and let puss group
puwcr.

'lhc faculty‘s civil wars Intrc lntd two
rcsnlis. First. thcy hm‘c larcd n cnrrusiyc
cynicism nhoul lhc uniycrsity and thc
lztcnlty‘s plncc in it. 'l'husc inculty who
tmcc fought for cxccllcncc hnvc rctrctttcd
to thcir studics whilc thc fcw who remain
to fight urc sccn us plcnding thcir own
cuscs and soon ncqnirc the ideology ofthc
\vcuk. attributing t hcir ill—l'nrtttnc to cun-
spirncics nnd tldlllllllsll‘tlllvc mulcynlcncc,

[tuning nwny fl'tllll collcngucs who
have hccn und :u'c soon In hc rctrcnchcd.
ihc lurgc mnjurity ul'thc inculty cuntinuc
with lhc business nl' cuursc schcduling
nnd thcir pctty jculnusics. The storm
which has destroyed their ncighbors‘
humcs will not touchthcirs.sothcythink;
an any l'tllc. they will do nuthingtn protcct
thcmsclvcs except to hopc for Ctlllll days
and bright skies.

'l hc sccnnd rcsult of thc luculty's wnrs
is the accumulation of power in thc hands
of thc ndministrtttion. Much of thc tid-
ministrntion's inilucncc has been won by
dcfnult. But to thc dcgrcc that the ad-
ministration has actively sought power. it
has done so against it confused and dis—
organized opponcnt. At this very mo-
mcnt. the faculty is pursuing its years old
practices. The Dcpnrtmcnts of History,
Economics. Mathematics and Public Ad-
ministration are searching for new fncul-
ty. and this at n time when retrenchment is
ncur at hand. This is understandable

‘ Fields
Of Power

given each department's judgement that
(i) it willescape reductioninforce; (2)it is
the best defender of its own interests; and
(3) in a period of turmoil and confusion,
keeping alternatives open is prudent and
might bring large dividends.

Our understanding should not,
however, obscure the fact that these
departments are being short-sighted and
dishonest.Thcy are short-sighted for in
trying to satisfy their immediate appetites
they endanger the well-being ofthc entire
community. It will not escape the
President's attention that the faculty is so
badly divided that parts of it are waiting
jackal-likc to devour the remains of
budget adjustments. He can. had he the
means, do with the faculty as he wishes
knowing that none will aid the other. The
departments are dishonest for raising
false expectations among persons looking
for employment and for their callous dis-
rcgttrd, which they share with other
dcpartmcnts. of their colleagues‘ fate.

In the midst of faculty discord. Presi-
dent Fields offers little. It did not seem
this wuyztt ﬁrst. Throughout the fall, the
President cxprcsscd support for giving
the university a national identity by tying
it closcrtothc state. This was a vague goal
which could cusin accommodate any
number of spccific objectives. Its
coherent development depended on the
spccd tll which the President and his ud-
viscrs could bring about significant
chunch in thc university before the state
govcrnmcnt cut deeper into it. it sccms
sufc to cuncludcthut President Ficlds was
11mm 1th the univcrsity was headed for
lmublcd wntcrs bcfnrc he arrived 0n the
campus. What hc could not have known
was hon seriously dumngcd the university
would hc after he lll'l'l\'C(.l. Thc dccp cuts
in thc umvcrsity‘s budch mean that he
plans for improving the profcsslonul
schools nrc at best at at standstill and at
worst dislntcgrnting.

Without thc mcttns of carrying out his
plans. the President is in in position to un—
consciously do :1 good dcnl of harm to thc
univcrsily. llccttusclhc l’rcsidcnt’s policy,
or lnck 0| it, is now 21 series of un—
ctmrdinutcd uticmpts to put cnlchwnrds
intu prttcticc. his priorities committee is
without guidelines for dcciding issucs of
great signiﬁcnncc for thc univcrsity cx-
ccpt for the injunction that thcy must cut.
The committee is composed of well-
mcztnlng persons nolubly lacking in in-
dcpcndcnt spirit, and in thc alarmingly
short time in which they have to make
their rccommcndutions it is safe to
prcdict that they will closely follow the

President's lend. Where the President is
leading, hOWevcr, is certainly not clear to
those outside his office. Whetherit is clear
to him is also in doubt.

'l‘hc rcsult of this irresponsible up-
prouch to the university is that the Presi-
dent has become the prophet of dis-
integration: his ambitions forthisuniver-
sity are falling apart on the rock of fiscal

stringency, while decisions on faculty
livelihood will be based overwhelmingly
on accumulated prejudices. ’ ‘
What lies ahead? There are two
possibilities. The university can continue
to ﬂounder without a destination. As an
institution it will survive the loss of facul-
ty, ruined presidential ambitions and in-
cessant faculty disputes. Yet its graduate
programs will slowly wither and its un-
iversity status will be jeopardized. There
will remain faculty and students involved
in exciting teaching and research. But
their efforts will be notable for being
isolated in a sea of mediocrity.

The second possibility—and, it must be
admitted. the more remote one—is that
slowly, cautiously and with a good deal of
effort there will be innovative educational
programs created and sustained at all
levels within the university. The initiative
for this cannot come from the administra-
tion, whose interests in the long run are
counter to those of faculty and students.
Administration support is essential for
change. but its role should be subsidiary
and not determinative, approving but not
predominant. The student contribution is
equally indispensable, but the very nature
of student life, the sensible preoccupation
with immediate tasks and the relatively
short-term stay at the university, works
against continued, long—range involve-
ment in this process.

This leaves the faculty to take the in-
itiative, not the faculty as a whole but
the faculty as 21 group of committed in-
dividuals concerned with the university‘s
future and willing to tryto shape it. There
are throughout this university persons of
established scholarly ability who are scn—
sitch to the complexities of university
governance, concerned with the events of

 

 

.‘the immediate past, 'worricd lest thin

worst fears become reality at a not too
distant date and wanting to improve the
university's condition but not certain how
to do it. If these persons could come
together and organize themselves, they
could. with appropriate access to the
. media, the state government and the un-
iversity system as a whole, begin the task
of moving the university towards clear.
sensible and realizable goals.

The nature of those goals cannot be
speciﬁed at this point. It would be
presumptuous to even minke that effort,
for it is the pre-eminent task which awaits
the faculty. This much. however, can be
noted. Haste and the craving for quick
results will doom any effort from the out-
set. Excellence in a university must be
nurtured carefully. it cannot be made
hostage to the vagaries of state politics or
the fleeting aspirations of administrators
and faculty. Far more important. there is
no alternative to the faculty deciding for
itself whether to lead or to follow,
whether to set the tasks and work for
them or to stand aside whilecventstake
decisions out of their hands. -

There can be no assurance that a facul-
ty group would be successful;too muchin
the university and thestate will be beyond
their control or inﬂuence. Yet with the ef-
fort thcy will have the opportunity for
success; without it. even the opportunity
will cvupornte. What befalls the universi-
ty will then touch everyone. and pious
declarations ofthc need for quality will be
lost amidst clamoring for defending
prerogatives of encrusted interests.
