by R. Corbin Houelltl
Wine appreciation certainly
doesn‘t require the traditional Euro-
pean sort of exposure from an early
age. People are sometimes surprised
to learn that I came from a dry state
and didn't discover wine until I went
to college in an eastern city. Like
most enthusiasts, I resolved to ex-
plore the subject when I experienced
how an inexpensive wine could
transform a plain meal intoasensual
experience.
It‘s easy to demonstrate. Get
yourself a glass of a good, sturdy
California burgundy and a
cheeseburger that hasn‘t been inun-
dated with somebody‘s special sauce.
Taste the wine. Now taste the
cheeseburger. (Unlike some
beverages, wine is not for washing
food down. Go back tothe burgundy
only after you have chewed and
swallowed the bite of the burger.)
You will find that some of the
things that make a cheeseburger
good, like the richness that comes
only from a significant fat content,
and some of the things that make
wine good, such as an interesting
level of acidity, are made for each
other. Tartncss in the wine
moderates that richness and seems to
clear the palate for fuller apprecia-
tion of the next bite.

Try it a few times, and soon the
differing characteristics of foods will
suggest different choices of wine to
you. When that happens, even if
your ﬁeld of experimentation was
limited to burgers, tacos and jug
burgundy. you will be more than
halfway toward raising the pleasure
level of your daily life through ap-
preciation of wine.

Yourfavoritecombinationmayor
may not correspond to tradition.
Certainly there are no rules, but peo-
ple have been matching wine and
food for centuries, and some useful
guidelines have developed. The first
pointer is that some wines are
designed to go with food and some
are intended to be consumed before
or after a meal. The former are

although they are more versatile
than that. They may be widte. pink
or red, but they share two basic
characteristics: They have little or no
sweetness, and their ﬂavors are due
to natural fermentation of grapes.
The table wine category includes.
inter alia, burgundy, chsblis. ehianti,
some rhine wine, virtually all

sweetness ~ from natural grape

The first thing most people hear ‘

about matehingtsble wine with food
is red wine with red meat, wla'le with
white and pink with everything
With a little ﬁxing, that cliche won't
malte a bad starting point for next

Away From It All In Arcadia

lifelikiziﬂzmﬁzi’m .- . ‘ -'

Do you sometimes want to get
away from it all? Find a better
world? Of course you do. Serious
philosophers and social critics have,
from the Classical period, at least,
down through the ages, busied
themselves with drawing up ideal
schemes for the perfect society.
There come to mind readin the
Republic of Plato andthe Utopia of
Sir Thomas Moore.

But these are rather heavy works
and full of social content. What
about something in the nature of an
earthly paradise, where the weather
is usually delightful, where there is
no more work than is neededto add

a httle ptquancy to leisure, and
where music and love abound?
That‘s it; you want to goto Arcady.

Something of this longing can be
seen in the myths of the golden age
during the reign of Saturn, when the
world enjoyed peace, and leisure,
and happiness. It is, however. tothe
pastoral poets especially that we owe
our romantic ideal ofthe fairyland of
Arcady. Arcadia, to be sure, was an
actual region of Greece, located in
the central Peloponnesus, a rural,
mountainous area, the home of the
god of shepherds, Pan. The principal
occupation was sheep herding.

The father of the pastoral as a
recognized literary genre was the
Alexandrian poet Theocritus. In his
writings, however, a down-to—earth
appreciation of the realities of
country life tempers the romantic
overtones. And the locale is not Ar-
cadia. With the Roman Vergil
realistic country life recedes further

into the background and fantasy has
a larger role, though there are many
thinly veiled allusions tothe difficult
social and political conditions of the
day. While the scene of Vergil's
pastorals is not really Arcadia, ills
poems are primarily responsible for
giving fairyland a home in Arcadia.
In Eclogue 10 the Roman pastoral '
poci Gallus is represented as singing
in Arcadia.

The idea was taken up by Euro-
pean and British writers and pain-.
ters. Sir Philip Sidncy(1554-1586)
wrote a long pastoral romance en-
titled Arcadia. ln English poetry the
name of the pastoral land of happy
leisure frequently appears as Ar-
cady. If you heard Mark Morford's
lecture: Ovid and Nicolas Poussin,
you know how Poussin (1594-1665)
made use of Arcadia as a setting for
some of his paintings. Have you ever

‘ seen a piece of Wedgwood pottery or

jewelry with its lovely, graceful

 

nymphs? The original designer,
Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was
inﬂuean by Classical themes.
Though Arcadia is_not mentioned,
surely its inspiration is present.

It‘s cold in Albany. The hard work
of the second semester is beginning.
Shall we all depart together for Ar-
cady?
