“This has been a most difﬁcult

said acting varsity wrestling coach

accurate reﬂection of the team‘s ef-
fort and steady development."

Indeed. lady luck has turned away
from a team which has sent several
wrestlers to the NCAA Tournament
in the recent past. Several experienc-
ed grapplcrs decided not to par-
ticipate this year, leaving the team
without a solid core of veterans.

The Albany State Indoor Track
Club opened its seasonlast Fridayin
a quadrangular meet at Williams
College.

“Although we game in fourth, we
scored three times as many points as
last year.” said rookie coach Doug
Allen.

One Week of Practice

The team had only one week of
practice before the meet, but several
Albany runners did well. Jon
Pollard won both the sixty yard dash
and‘hurdies, while Hiram Pebbles
took the triple jump. Chris Burns,
Fred Kimow, and Don Schroeder
all qualiﬁed for the Cortland in-

Saturday. there will be a

triangular meet at Union College
between Albany St., Colgate and
host Union. Track and ﬁeld events
begin at twelve noon. while the run-
ning events get under way at one
o'clock. “We have an excellent shot
in the long jump, triple jump,
hurdles, and sprints," said Alien.
“We're not in good shape yet, as we
don't have a ﬁeld-house, but the
team works out every day in the
tunnels."
Stiff Competition

Allen believes Albany will score a
lot of points, but will meet up with
stiff competition from Union's
Stryer and Jones in the mile. and
Moffet in the sprints.

“We should run a good mile with
Benman. Davis and Burns running

under 4:30," said Allen. Carlo
Cherubino will interrupt his Olym-
pic marathon workouts long enough
to run the two mile race for Albany.
Thetwo mile relay will berun by Phil
Sullivan, Tom Ryan, Fred Skidrow,
and Eric Johnson. Allen is looking
forward to the meet.

“Last year we only scored ten
points, but with this team, we'll give
a credible performance," he said.

and although our talent is young
and we‘ve paid the price of inex-

in several meets in spite of havingthe
toughest wrestling schedule in
years."

Gary Fcrber (freshman —I I8) has
shown great improvement
throughout the year, according to
Porter, and canlookfoward toafine
colllcgiate career at Albany.

Albany's regular at I26 pounds.
Manny Cruz, has never wrestled
before, yet has managed tothrill the
fans with his “novel” tactics.
Brad Beilly has seen action at both
I26 and I34 pounds. despite an
elbow injury. ‘

Tony Pugliesc has done most of
the wrestling in the I34—pound, and
has shown well against very tough
competition. according to Porter,
and should combine with the dis~
ablcd Sam Fischetti to shore up this
key class.

One of our best and exciting this
year has been Vic Gagliardi at I42
pounds," said Porter.

Cragliardi is 9-5-1 and Porter ex-
pects him to do well inthe upcoming
individual tournaments.

Transfer Kevin Schiatti became
eleigible this semester and has seen
action at 142, I50and 158andshows
ﬁne potential. according to Poner.

Gabe Natarclli, a transfer from
Central Conn. and local boy from
Shenendahoa High, has maintained
the number one slot in the 150 class.
He is a senior. and will be missed
next year.

Junior Nick Zubuiakc has met
challengers at I50, l58, and l67,and
is considered by many to bethc most
aggressive member'of the team. He is
another of those who have never
wrestled before.

Team captain Jack D'Ambrosio is
6-i-I at 158. despite his injured
ankle. Should the ankle hold up. he
is a good bet to qualify for the
nationals.

.lon Alden wrestles at I67 and is
“a leg wrestler" whotakes advantage
his long “snake-like" legs and made
his competitors wish they‘d taken
up basketball.

Perhaps freshman Earl Jordan at
I77 and I90 has the greatest poten-
tial talent ofthe newcomers. He has
met some of the toughest competi—
tion and won many impressive vic-
tories. accordingto Porter. His com-
plement is Chris Covtts. also ver—
satile. Few schools have this kind of
strength in those weight classes,
Porter said.

John Natarclli is the most ex-
perienced and. at times, most cx-
plosivc ofthe grapplcrs. accordingto
Porter. He has secnactionnt l9iland
in the heavyweight class. Other
heuvywoight include: Dave Mathis
Tirclla ( who doubles as the team‘s
trainer). and and Ty Quinn (another
freshman).

“These individuals have all made _

great strides," Porter said. “Their
morale has remained amazingly

high. If success can be measured in _

terms of good memories. then we
have a season which will never be
forgotten.”

The wrestlers travel to Bingham-
ton this weekend for the SUNYAC

Championships; the State Cham- :

pionships follow. Any wrestler
finishing in the top three in either

meet qualiﬁes for the NCAA Tour- '

namcnt.

SUNY: Central Cuts Urged By m State Teachers * 

by Sue Emmott .

Calling SUNY Central Ad-
ministration a “stumbling block,"
SUNY Enghamton's math depart-
ment chairman Louis McCauley has
begun a petition drive for substantial
administrative cuts.

“The organization as a whole is
grossly inefﬁcient and overstaffed,"
says McCauley. He feels that while a
small staff is needed to handle
monitoring and coordinating of
State University programs. SUNY
Central “needs to be completely
reorganized and trimmed to a very
small,‘ highly qualiﬁed staff which
would operate in a very efﬁcient
manner working withthe Division of
the Budget and the State Education
Department."

Underlying McCauley's concern
with what he estimates as a $9
million operating budget for SUNY
Central is his observation that“Cen-
tral Administration teaches no
classes."

SUNYA political science
professor Bernard K. Johnpoll
agrees. SUNY Central “has done
nothing for education," says John-

poll. He contends that he would
rather‘see members of SUNY'Cen-
tral unemployed than see professors
unemployed.

While McCauley feels that SUNY
Central should be trimmed 90 per-
cent .Iohnpoll claims that it should
be completely eliminated. “The
abolition of SUNY Central is the
ﬁrst major move which should be
taken," says Johnpoll. “It is a
bureaucratic, political organization.
which is the worst enemy education
has.” ,

The abolition of SUNY Central,
according to SUNY Chancellor
Ernest L. Boyer, “probably would
mean the abolition of the university
as a unique, overall enterprise.”
Boyer says, “The strength of State
University derives in part because of
the combined network of cam-
puses.”

Boyer claims that the re-
assignment to individual campuses
of certain functions now carried out
by SUNY Central on behalf of all the
campuses would be “an enormous
disservice” to the university system.
Such central functions include

Wallace Makes Short

by David Winzelberg

Democratic front-runner for
President George Wallace gave a
twenty-minute press conference at
the Albany County Airport yester-
day afternoon.

The Alabama governor spoke to
about one hundred newsmcn and
spectators in a campaign pit-stop
at the Page Airways terminal, before
leaving for a Pittsﬁeld. Mass. rallyin
a caravan of sedans.

In the spotlight-flooded terminal.
Wallace ﬁelded questions behind a
table flanked by security men and
campaign staffers. Wallace said that
certain candidates and others in the
Democratic party were plotting his
demise.

“The Democratic party wants to
see me taken out of some of the
primaries," said Wallace.

In explaining the Democratic par-
ty‘s attitude towards his candidacy,
Wallace cited the primaries in I972:
“I did too well in Michigan. Ididtoo
well in Maryland and New Mexico. I
did too well in North Carolina."

Wallace denounced the results of
certain state caususes and said the
President should be elected by the
people. Raising his voice, Wallace
said “let them [the people] vote."

Knocks Quotas

Wallace attacked big government
and the income tax. He said it was
about time someone stood up for
"that great group in the middle.“

“All of the candidates are talking
like me," said Wallace, “they‘re talk-
ing like I did in ‘72 and in '68.

He knocked quotas and percen-
tages as being “asininc” and “ab—
solutely ridiculous," but pointed out

budgetary. legal, construction, per-
sonnel, and legislative concerns.

Says Boyer, “We protect the un-
iversity against what we think arcin-
appropriate incursions upon the
academic life and integrity of the un-
iversity.”

Ernest L. Boyer.

While defending the existence of
SUNY Central, Boyer claimsto have
been “almost ruthless" in keeping
costs and personnel to a minumum
since he has been Chancellor. He
says that he has cut personnel at

that he was the leading Democratic
candidate for President accordingto
the Gallup poll.

in response to a reporter‘s ques-
tion, Wallace said that his
appearance in South Boston last Fri-
day wasn‘t meant to cause trouble.
“Violence is no way," saidthe Gover-
nor. “thc way to win these matters is
at the ballot box."

Wallac'e feels that “no
geographical bias exists anymore" in
a Presidential election. “We are one
nation," he said.

Wallace said that Alabama voted
for Al Smith. the former New York
governor who ran for the Presidency
in I928, and sees no reason why New
York can‘t vote for him in I976.

Wallace said, "The Lehmans of
New York Were from Montgomery.
so We're sort of related."

SUNY Central by almost one-third
and adds. “I certainly don't want to
justify spending one dime that can't
be appropriately defended.”

The future of McCauley's peti-
tion drive is uncertain. McCauley
took petitions with approximately
650 signatures to Director of State
Operations Robert MorGado and
suggested that an independent in-
vestigation of SUNY Central be un-
dertaken. »

MorGado says that he will make
such an investigation but admits, “I
have several biases in this area." He
feels that “a fragmentation ofthe un-
iversity so that this ofﬁce dealing
with each campus as a separate enti-
ty is not beneﬁcial. There's always
going to' be a need for a strong cen-
tral f ocus."

McCauley also sent copies of his
petition to other SUNY campuses.
A copy of the petition was received
by SUNY‘s math department.

According to department chair-
man Thomas MacGregor, “It‘s there
for people to sign. I didn‘t feel
obligated to distribute it.".
MacGregor says that while he agrees

“moreorless’l with McCauley's peti-
tion, he feels that “it may beineti'ec-
tive" in bring'ngabout cutsin SUNY
Central.

SUNY Central is not the only ad-
ministrative group to come under
scrutiny in the wake of extensive
budget cuts. According to Me-
Cauley. "Administrations on all
campuses can be reorganized to
some extent.” He admits that
SUNY-Binghamton will be losing
some administrators dtie to decreas-
ed allocations.

Johnpoll has recently released his
study of administrative costs at
SUNYA. He concludes that the “ac-
tual administrative cost at this Un-
iversity ranges between 25 and 35
percent of the total cost."

A self-proclaimed anti-
bureaucrat, Johnpoll laments what
he sees as a trend for administrators
to be bureaucrats rather than
educators.

Speaking of SUNYA. Johnpoll
says, “In my view. there is not a
single vice president in this school
who could get tenure at any decent

RA ’3 Could Lose Single Rooms

by Randi B. Toler (SASU)

Governor Hugh Carey's budget
for the State University of New York
has left no stone unturned. As a
result, resident assistants for the fall
I976 semester will probably be
receiving less compensation for their
duties than they had expected.

Governor Carey‘s budget states
that "$300,000 in income will be rais-
ed from a rcduciioninthe number of
free rooms given resident assistants
and others.” It is now up to SUNY
Central Administrationto decide ex-
actly how that revenue is to be rais-
ed.

Dr. Ronald ilristow, Associate
Dean in the Vice Chancellor‘s Ofﬁce
for University-Wide Services and
Special Programs. wants
suggestions from all of the campuses
before making his decision. He has
asked Robert Coon, Chairperson of
the Council of Chief Student Affairs

Administrators to prepare a
recommendation for consideration.
In a paper studying the resident
assistant programs in the State Un-
iversity. Bristow recommended that
the maximum number of students a
resident assistant be responsible for
should be 25. The ratios now vary on
the state operated campuses. Stony
Brook has the lowest ratio of [:23
while Albany‘s ratio is the highest at
i:32.9. Bristow explained that the
reason for the differences in ratios is
often due to the physical room dis-
tribution in the dormitories.

The Division of the Budget would
like to see a uniform resident assis-
tant ratio and compensation practice
throughout the State University.
Bristow. however, does not feel that
it would be fair to force conformity
on all of the campuses. “Each cam-
pus hns its own program." he said.
“If all our campuses could operate in

the same way, then every campus in
the country could operate in the
same way. I think it‘s important that
the campuses have ﬂexibility."

The onlyform of resident assistant
compensation mentioned in the
Governor‘s budget is the free rooms
that all campuses provide for their
RAs. Most schools provide their
