FEBRUARY 17, 1976

Would you be interestedinleaﬁng
through a copy of a magazine called
Astounding Science Fiction, dated
September 9. 1937? Or perhaps you
are thinking of investing in the stock
market. and would likctoseethean-
nual reports of the company dating
back to I965? Maybe you‘re in-
terested in ﬁnding out who lived in
your house on Quail Streetin l834’i

if these questions arouse your
curiosity. the answers can be easily
found. In the basement of the
library. at the end of a narrow.
easily-missed hallway, lies the
Special Collections. It is here that
you will find the answers to the
above questions along with answers
to questions you may never have
even thought to ask.

Anna May Lilly, Associate Direc-
tor for Special Services. says the
collection includes a wide variety of
material. ranging from the very
oldest [rare books] up to material
received on a weekly basis. “We try

 

to work with the researching needs
of the university”. says Lilly. “All the
material we have down here is listed
in the card catalog upstairs in the
main lobby. The only stipulation is
that the material must be used here.
under our supervision." I

Marion Munzer. Curator of
Special Collections. feels that
students don‘t use the Special
Collections room to its fullest poten-
tial. "Many students don’t even
realize all the different categories we
have here. We have collections on
radical literature. World War I.
quaeks and quackery. lotteries
(dating back to the early lotteries in
England during the 1500‘s) and rare
books. just to name a few.“

Rare books have a separate room
of their own, and Harriet Adams.
Rare Book Librarian. explained
how a book gets classified as rare.
“ Either a book is particularlyfragilc.
or has a high intrinsic value, or the
subject matter is considered too
open to vandalism. and are im-

Library 2    

mediately added to the rare boolt
collection. “We have books dating
back to the ISOO and l600's. many'of
which we are still in the process of
categorizing."

Among the booksin the collection
are Dietlonno Des Sciences,
Didero‘s famous encyclopedia of the
sciences. dating back to Hill. There
is also the ﬁrst edition of Adam
Smith’s Wealth of Nations, which
the library plans to display as part of
the bicentennial celebration.

One of the more expensive books
of the collection is Finder. by
Zachariam Calergi. published in
15 IS. Originally bought for $250.00.
it would now sell for $950.00. Adams
explained “Many of these books are
irreplaceable. Most were purchased
years ago. and since then the price of
rare books have morethantripled."

The collection also includes such
things its travel books. histories.
classical literature and art books.
Adams admitted that there are still
many books which haVe not yet been

       
   
 

 
 
    

     
    
    

uncovered and categorized for use.
“It is a fascinating. yet tcdiouslyslow
process to categorize each individual
book.“ she explained.

The security around. the books is
tight. and the door is always locked.

Women’s Caucus Fights Losing Battle in Affirmative Action Case

that she had functioned competently
inthe past as surrogate ofﬁcer while
holding the lesser title of associate.
and was entitled to a nominal
promotion. Hartley explained that
since Norman is a black woman. her
appointment would represent the es-
scnce of Afﬁrmative Action‘s goals.
Caught in the middle is Kay Nor-
man. who maintains a busy ofﬁccin
the Administration building.’ She
monitors hiring policies and tenure
and promotions proceedings, while
at the same time investigating stu-
dent and faculty grievances and
complaints lodged against the un-
iversity to external commissions.
Norman also works with the Civil
Service to develop a management

training program for women, and is
in the process of instituting an Afﬁr-
mative Action plan for hiring han-
dicapped people.

Norman calls her job one of
“developing a campus which reﬂects
the true nature of society."

Provisions for Advancement

The emphasis is on guaranteeing
equal employment opportunities.
says Norman. who feels that this
goes beyond the basic evaluation of
the demography of hired personnel.
According to her. it isjust as impor-
tant to oppose the more subtle
restrictions on job opportunities
produced bysuch things as failure to
provide adequate notification to
potential candidates. Norman also
feels that equal opportunity should

include provisions for advancement
through promotion.

Norman. a soft-spoken woman.
said that she had been “personally
hurt" bythe controversythat accom-
panied her appointment. Norman
disagreed with the Cnucus‘ conten-
tion that other people should have
been allowed to apply for the posi—
tion.

She compared her situation to
that of the faculty: just as teachers
rise through the professorial ranks
without having to rc-apply for their
jobs. says Norman. so she was simp-
ly being given a promotion. Nor-
man‘s refusal to react to the dispute
last semester was due to her convic-
tion that her activities in the Affir-
mative Action ofﬁce were of a

higher priority.

Although individual members
continue to feel unhappy about the
way the Afﬁrmative Actions Ofﬁcer
was selected. the Women‘s Caucus
has decided that it would not be
diplomatically advantageous 'to
press the issue further. The group
claims that while intending to co
operate fully with the Afﬁrmative
Action ofﬁce. it does plan to keep an
eye on the Administration to make
certain that sanctioned hiring
procedures are not violated.

Schulz is conﬁdent that the Ad-
ministration won‘t “make the same
mistake“. But did the Caucus‘ reac-
tion effect any real change in the Ad-
ministration's employment policy'.’
“No. not a bit." says Hartley.

under supervision. There is good
reason for such extreme security
measures. according to Adams. “To
my knowledge. since I‘ve been work-
ing here. nothing has been stolen.
But four or ﬁve years ago. a lot of
material was taken from special
collections. in addition to other
departments. Fortunately. most of
the books were recovered. among
which was found a rare book belong-
ing to Russell Sage College. valued
at more than SI0.000."

All the material in the Special
Collections and Rare Books are
either purchased by the library
bibliographers. or donated to the
library. Special Collections has a
category entitled “Manuscripts”.
which are kept locked in the vault.
These manuscripts. according to
Munzer. have a time hold on them.
and cannot be opened until the death
of the donator and his family. Many
of these scaled documents have
political overtones. and might prove
to be quite fascinating when ﬁnally
revealed.
