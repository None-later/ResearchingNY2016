There are ﬁlms that derive their
expressiveness from the strength of
their characterization. The director's
careful use of dialogue and action.
the choosing to portrary signiﬁcant
moments in the history of the
character, and the drawing out of the
natural abilities of an actor; all these
may create a ﬁlm in which the
audience is at one with the
characters.

Alilm‘s expressiveness maytoo be
derived from an intriguing plot line

1 cannot believe what the disco
scene is doing to some jazz
musicians. Jan. and soul are similar
styles and most jazz musicians have
few problems playing soul. Many
soul albums have jazz musicians
supplying the rhythm; yet some
jazzmcn have trouble in this idiom.

Esther Philips is it product of old
stylejazz-blucs music. She received a
recording contract with Kudu and
released three albums. Although
they were well done. none of them
sold well. Kudu records wasn't over-
joyed at this and decided to fashion
her music to attract the disco crowd.
They made Joe Beck her arranger

that has less emphasis on
characterization. A director may
choose to leave his characters
sketchy. This effect allows them to
remain emblems; symbols of a
thought or cinematic paradigm that
the director sees as important. In
these cases. the actors must be
restrained; a longsigh is stiﬂed into a
short nod. tears into a descending
glance of the eyes.

Often these two concepts of plot
and character are integrally tied up.

When a director carefully decides to

lazy or has decided to experiment.
These tWo elements are at work in

further clues to her psyche. Anne is

shortcuts to character understan-
ding. The morning after Anne‘s sex-
ual awakening. she rises and goes to
the piano, performing Chopin. She
dies of that great l9th Century
Romantic disease. consumption.

The analogues with impressionist
art cannot be taken too far. The

cd from the canvases of Manet.

Muriel. and Claude were born a bit
too early.

The footage is often grainy. The

of D. W. Griffith‘s films. The
emphasis on stock emotions also dis-
plays l'ruffaut‘s debt to early
movies.

Perhaps. as in “Day for Night."
Francois 'l‘ruffiiut is as much in—

hollow. From a different director we

experiment; ii touching splash of

it is 'd film of shreds and patches.

And there arc smaller groups of
