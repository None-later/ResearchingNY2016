The consensus from sports stalT
members at WSUA was delight.

“This is great for WSUA and
satisfying for me in my last year
here." said WSU A‘s Sports Director
Douglas Lewanda. "Nothing like
this has ever happened to the station
in its 13 year existence."

Perhaps beat summing upthe feel-
ing was sportscaster Michael Curwin
who asked rhetorically. “What fun
never dreamed of announcing a real.
professional sporting event?“

Considering the fact that there is
no broadcasting major at SUNYA,
for some Albany State student in-
terested in a career in the field, the
opponunilies are obvious.

Track and Field Goes Varsity SUNYAC Battle:

The Albany State Women‘s Track
and Field team has scheduled anin-
tercst meeting Wednesday at 7 pm.
in the Physical Education Building
(PE-125).

Along with the various relays.
track and ﬁeld (one of Albany
State's major women‘s varsity
sports) consists of thejavelin throw.
shot-put. discus throw. hurdlingand
the long and highjump events. Com—
petition is centered upon individual
performances with relays providing
tt four-woman team effort.

“This is our first year as a varsity
team.“ said couch Barbara Palm.
“and we‘ve had indications of a
good number of tntcrcstcd athletes.

At this stage. we consider it a grow-
ing sport on campus.“
End of Trial Period

Last year‘s record of 4 wins and 7
losses marked the end of the three
year trial club period establishing a
varsity span. Slated ugainst the stiff
competition of Southern Connec-
ticut. Cortland. Springfield. Rutgers
and Brockporl. each equipped with
years of track competition beneath
their belts. the youngtbam will sure—
ly learn the hurdles first hand.

“We draw a fairly good crowd,“
added Palm. “because track is entire-
ly different from the other team
sports. The events are held outside
and lend toward spectatorship.“

championship is now a ﬁve team
race.

Only Oneonta (7-1). Plattsburgh

mathematical running. and
Brockport and Oswego have been
virtually eliminated because of losses
to Oneonta. and in Brockport'scase.
Plattsburgh as well.

The race may be over by Sunday
because the contenders will all be in
action this week, and Albany State's

conference.

Here‘s a look at the schedule:

Tonight: Potsdam at Oswego,

Wednesday: Plattsburgh at
ALBANY. Genesco at Brockport.

Saturday: ALBAN Y at
Brockport. Fredonia at Oneonta.
