Nuclear Energy?

Last week, a nuclear pOWer
plant in Vermont closed because
of a flaw in the safety system.
Had the plant not been shut
down it may have caused “an ac-
cident on a scale unknown to a
peacetime nation". causing
almost immediate deathforfrom
12to20milesinadditiontocaus-
ing radiation sickness and con-
tamination over a much wider
area.

The United States govern-
ment. along with the nations
energy producing corporations
are preparing to lock our
economy into a nuclear energy
system by the year 2000. The
New York Public Interest Group
(NYPIRG) believes this is a
serious mistake. There are many
serious problems with nuclear
power; here are a few:

Lc/lml was/e: An average
Nuclear power plant produces
about 200,000 grams of
Plutonium 239 every year. One
gram of Plutonium 239 could
cause several million cases of
Lung cancer. It remains deadly
for hundreds of thousands of
years. and cannot be safely
stored, disposes of. or neutraliz-
ed.

Accidents: If a nuclear chain
reaction within a power plant
gets out of control, the heat in a
reactor increases to the point
where it can catise asteam explo-
sion capable of shattering the
containment structure, releasing
enough radioactivity to kill
thousands. The Emergency Core
Cooling System, which should
prevent such a disaster has never
been tested. A model was tested
six times. Each time it failed.

Du-it-J'ours‘el/ Atomic limit/iv:
Experts say it‘s easier to steal
Plutonium than rob a bank. Any
competent Physicist could use
this Plutonium to construe an
Atom bomb.

lz'nicrgwit'_i' Evacumimz: If a
serious radiative release oc-
curred. everyone within a 100—
mile radius might have to be

evacuated in 12 hours. There are
nuclear plants within a few miles
of New York. Boston. Los
Angeles and other cities. Thereis
no conceivable way these cities
could be evacuated within 12
hours.

Insurance: A nuclear power
plant accident could cause up to
$22.4 Billion in property damage
and billions more in personal in-
jury claims. Presently nuclear
power plants are insured for only
$560 million. No insurance com-
pany in the world will insure for
$22.4 Billion.

These are just a few of the
problems involved. In site ofthis.
everyone in government or the
industry concerned with nuclear
power ignore these dangers as
significant— until last week.
When one of Vermont‘s nuclear
plants closed down on February
51h. three high ranking nuclear
engineers for General Electric
who helped design nearly 100
plants. resigned. All three said
that they were no longer con-
vinced of the technical safety of
nuclear power and would active-
ly campaign against its use for
energy.

This is one of NYI’IRG‘s ma-
jor areas of concern. Along with
informing the public of nuclear
power‘s dangers. we are propos-
ing Safe Energy Legislation in
New York.

NYPIRG is also working on a
number of other issues: banning
non returnable bottles in New
York, passing truth-in-testing
Legislation, various studies such
as funeral home practices, unit
pricing. auto repair services. and
decriminaliling marijuana in
New York. as well as many other
things.

For those interested in finding
out more about why we can‘t live
with nuclear power or about how
you can get involved. NYI’IRG
is holding a general meeting on
I‘ebruary filth at 8:00 I’M (place
will be announced). Iivet'yone is
encouraged to attend.

Camp Dippikill Governing
Board is please to annouce that
two additional cabins will be
constructed at Student
Association‘s Camp Dippikill
this summer. By a 25 to 0 vote
Central Council approved the
plans for the two structures. On
building will be an 12’ x 16’sing1e
room log cabin with fottr beds
relatively similar to the small
cabin already in use at the camp.
The other lodge will be a larger
24' x 36’ five room building. A
front and side view. and floor
plan are included. The two
buildings will cost about $29,000
with construction scheduled to
begin in June. The cabins will be
ready for use by next winter. A11

labor. general contracting and
design work are being done by
students or alumni. The money
being used is the remains of a
fund known as thc“(‘am p Board
Reserve". This money has been
ptit aside each year out of the
L'ampu Board's bttdgct
specifically for major construc-
tion, therefore there is nosudtlcn
drain on any uncommitted SA
funds.

The board decided to con»
strttct the smaller buildings
specifically to try to satist
current student usage rc-
quircmcnts at the camp. Illt.‘
trend Iater has been for Item}
demand by individuals. couples.
and small groups.
