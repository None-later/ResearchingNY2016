volunteers that we needed.
Rather than evaluate the courses
that we had student coverage for
and leave the rest undone. we
chose to cancel ACT. We felt
that spotty coverage would make
amockeryofthe ACT. However.
half a dozen departments ran the
ACT evaluation through the
department and the results for
these departments will be printed
in the next edition of ACT.

Without your help. ACT will fail
again. If you are willing to help
us. fill out the form below and
either drop it off at the campus

Help us help you; help us make

ly focusing their attention on
programs such as Nursing,
whose fate was left uncertain by
the Select Committee Report
and Benezet‘s decisions. The
Fields Task Force is expected to
make recommendations onthese
programs sometime next week.
THE CURRENT TASK
FORCE

1n the past four wee ks the Task
Force has met for an estimated
108 hours. not counting sub-
committee meetings. The 16
member group. chosen mostly
from the ranks of University
Senate Councils and the former
Select Committee, is charged
with reviewing all aspects of the
university including administra-
tion. maintenance and opera-
tion. Fields has instructed the
Task Force to base its decisions
on three “strategic princippes":
“First. the preservation and nur-
turing of those programs which
are essential and central to a un-
iversity; second. the preservation
of quality; and third. the prescr-
vation and nurturing of those
programs that uniquely address
otrr immediate environment
The State Capital District of
New York.“

These principles and that of
meeting long term enrollment

trends were stated at a December
University Senate meeting. At
that time. Fields announced a
tentative allocation of rcsotirces
for 1976-77. Although his plan
has been ruined by the Executive
Budget cuts. Fields is still deter-
mined to place increased
emphasis on programs involving
public policy impact. Such
programs are Public Affairs.
Social Welfare. Education and
Criminal Justice.

Whether the President can
begin to guide the university in
this direction in the next fiscal
year depends on the Legislature
which has yet to vote on the
SUNY appropriation. Last year.
the Legislature made cuts far
greater than were mandated in
last year‘s Executive Budget.
With its current concern for local
assistance and no new taxesin an
election year. the Legislature
may further cut the State Univer-
sity.

The University at Albany‘s
future remains undecided. liyen
in January President l‘iclds
noted that this latest round of
cuts would serve as a "test of our
stamina as a university.“ l‘urthcr
cuts by the Legislature could
make Field‘s comment a tragic
understatement.

Dead Rats and Money

How is our rat different from
other rats? Our rat is a dead rat.
Cold and sterile. It has the

ofthe suggestions being made on
how to build a better rat trap:

the rathskellar.

2)Remove the wall in front of
the snack bar and put furniture
in that area.

3)Make the snack bar counter
more suitable to a fast food
operation.

4)Lower the ceiling (plastic
wood beams).

Students With New Policy

by CS. Santlno

A special committee appointed by
SUNYA‘s School of Business Dean
William Holstein is presently
processng over 280 applications to
determine who will major in business
and who will not.

“We are allowing for about 260
positions." says Holstein.

Ltist November. students in-
terested in majoring in business or
accounting were notified that the
School of Business could no longer
accomodate the ever-growing ranks
of business majors. Students were
asked to file an undergraduate ad—
mission application for the first time
in the school's history.

“We must limit our enrollment to
the level of a year ago," says Hols-
tein. “The School of Business can‘t
keep growing to absorb all the
students who want to be business
majors."

Holstein‘s controversial new
policy is “purely a result of the
statistics." he says. In I973. about
ten percent ofthe freshman class ex-
pressed an interest in majoring in
business. in the Fall of I974. that
figure grew to l2 percent. at which
time the nationwide swing towards
business cdtication had become an
obvious trend across the nation.

Holstein discussed the problem
with SUNYA administrators and
implemented a number ofcliangesto
deal with the increasing enrollment.

Two new faculty members were
added. “which was all we could af-
ford“ says Holstein. The sizc of ice-
ttirc courses was enlarged to take on
a maximum of students.

Holstein says that the situation
became “absolutely unworkable“
when. in I975. inorcthan l7 percent
of the freshman class indicated a
preference for business.

"This is a significant change.“ says
Holstein. “not a fad or a craze. It is
unreasomible to expect a university
to he so flexible as to accomodate all

these students. Students presently in
the program have a right to a quality
education. and my faculty has its
rights, also. By accepting everyone.
the quality will quickly deteriorate."

Holstein also cited the fact that his
faculty's teaching load is 50 percent
greater than in most departments,
and that course section sizes are at a
minimum of 40 students each. The
overall number of business majors
has doubled since l969to about l200
students.

By Jan. 3|. I976. the official cut—
off date. the School of Business had
received about 280 applications.
primarily from sophomores. The
minimum requirements for accep-
tuncc are completion of at least 56
credits. 15 of which must be in six
core courses listed on the form.

“Having completed at least this
much,“ says Holstein. "students will
be accepted on the basis of
cumulative average.“

The student who is accepted by
Holstein's Committee on Un-
dergraduate Admissions will be
allowed to major in business or ac-

and cannot take any upper level

be restricted to majors.

“A rejection.“ says one student.
“means that I‘ve wasted two
semesters taking core business
courses. After I've paid tuition.
haven‘t I the right to major in the
department of my choice?"

Many prospective business
students are disturbed about the new
policy. especially those whose grades
may put them on the borderline.
Holstein reports that students Visit
him daily to demand acceptance. A
number of students have threatened
to file suit against the University if
they are rejected.

Some applicants feel that if the
trend in education is towards
business. then the University should

allocate more funds inthat direction.
Holstein. however. is not quick to
ask for more money.

“Being a university center. we
must save smaller programs.“ says
Holstein. “The Administration can‘t
just cut them to enlarge my school.
I‘m trying to work with the Ad-
ministration. not as an adversary."

Students who applied to the
School of Business will be notiﬁed of
their status by the end of next week.

Control Of Student Tax Funds Questioned-

by Larry Buchwalter

A SUNY-wide task force on stu-
dent aetivity fees has recommended
revisions of the present guidelines
for collection and dispersion ofthese
funds. The suggestions of the task
force are aimed at clarifying the
amount of control administrations
should have over student tax money.

One proposed amendment could
make it easier for student cor-
porations like SASU and NYl’lRG
to get funding. in short. it clarifies
the right of student organizations to
support or contribute to various
charitable groups. and allows fortlic
transfer of funds to student cor-

porations.

The task force recommended.
however. that fees not be used to
fund such things as an “extra-
campus political committee. party
or candidate.“

The task force was formed in Oct.
1974 by SUNY Chancellor Ernest
Boyer. lt consisted of four students
and eleven administrators from
SUNYICentral and State campuses.

In a letter. Boyer stated that the
purposes of the task force should he
to “examine the appropriateness of
the current method of fundingthose
programs and activities supported
by strident activitv fees.“ Boyer

SUNYA Women Speak

by Ellen Weiss
and Susan E. Miller

A task force has been created to
eliminate 88 faculty positions at
SUNYA. Are women or men more
likely to be fired? The answer is
speculation. however a look at the
present situation may be helpful.

Presently there is a dispropor—
tionate ratio of female and male
professors throughout the SUNY
system. A study conducted in 1974
revealed SUNY employed 4,472
female and l2.732 male full-time
professors. SUNYA‘s facultyinclud-
ed 158 female and 646 male full-time
professors.

Many reasons are cited for the
lack of female representation in the
state university faculty. Kaye Nor-
man. head of SUNYA‘s Affirmative
Action Office. feels traditional roles
and ideologies are key factors.

She explained. “We are in a time
when we [the United States] are ceas-
ing to be as parochial in our ideal as
____________._.._.__.—

This is the ﬁrst of a series of ar-
ticles examining .iexii'm on campus.

further stated that the task force
should “assess and recommend alter-
native courses the university
could/should take in this regard."

Accordingto Russ Gugino. Assis-
tant to the Vice Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs and a member of the
task force. “the task force is only an
advisory committee. The recommen-
dations it makes are subject to the
review and approval by the Board of
Trustees.“

This review will occur in the next
two months. says SASU President
Bob Kirkpatrick. who was also a
member of the task force.

Comments on the student cor-

we‘ve been in the past. Unfortunate-
ly. in academic institutions We have
not changed that much."

The responsibility of Affirmative
Action is to monitor employment
and relate it to data and norms. They
make sure that equal opportunity
laws. mandates and executive orders
involving employment are upheld.
Norman feels most people know the
expectations ofthe laws but there is a
“difference in principle and practical
applications basic to academic in-
stitutions."

Many people feel the attitude
towards women must be modified
before any of the fair employment
policies can be fully implemented.
Dean of Humanities Ruth A.
Schmidt said. “a change in attitude
will mean full equality. The universi-
ty is it reflection of society‘s pre-
judices." Schmidt would like to see
more support for women's studies at
SUNYA.

Another difficulty faced by
women today is. according to Nor~
man. “The conflict of tradition and
the new emerging woman." She f cell

porations amendment range from
fears of its being a device that could
he used to funnel money for political
purposes. to praise for itsexpanding
student control over the use of stu-
dent funds. '

Thomas Craine. SUNY Buffalo
Assistant to the President. thinks
that it “immodestly provides the
ability to ‘launder‘ monies in nearly
unlimited ways."

According to Gugino. SA wants
the “uses ofthe fundsto be expanded
to anything the student wants.“

Kirkpatrick states that. “There
might be some problems when the

there will be difficulties encountered
by anyone breaking the status quo.
She said.“Many women wait until
the trail is clear and take the path of
least resistance—~they‘re followus."
The future of female full-time
professors at SUNYA is so far un-
determined. Schmidt feels we will see
a declining number of women in
academic hierarchy because few
women are being hired. She alsosaid
