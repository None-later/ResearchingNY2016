Alex turned his car into his mother‘s
driveway and came to a stop. He turned
the key off, but the engine kept runningin
a spasmodic surge. He finally put the shift
into gear and let his foot off the clutch.
The car jerked forward just a touch and
fell silent. His mother came out the front
door before he was even out of the car.
“Alex, your grandmother doesn't
answer the phone." She had a harried
look on her face and the corners of her
mouth twitchcd nervously. “I tried to call
you at your apartment earlier, but . . .
she‘s been sick lately. I told you." She
broke off suddenly, trying to calm her
ﬁdgeting hands.

Alex said nothing at first. He got out of
the car and closed the door slowly, not
slamming it, but clicking it shut.

"Could you take me over there?‘ His
mother asked. looking up from her
hands.

"Sure." Alcx nodded without anything
more to say.

“I‘ll get my coat . . . I‘ll be right back."
She turned and hurried back tothe front
doon

  
   

prised she had lived this long. Many of
those in her family (there had been thir-
teen) had already died. She was the only
survivor. Her husband had died before
Alex was born. Every Christmas she
would take out a picture of him and tell
Alex how much he reminded her of him.
The brown-tinted photograph showed
two men with straw hats onthe deck ofa
steam boat. Alex's grandfather (“that
wild-eyed Torn Ryan" as his grandmother
called him) was laughing atsomethingthe
other man had said. It was so different
from other photographs of the time, that
were so seriously and ccremoniously pos-
ed.

Alex took the back roads to his grand-
mother’s apartment. His mothertwisteda
piece of kleenex in her fingers. All along
the river blazes of autumn colour sprang
up on each side of the grey water. Often
clouds would pass between the bright
afternoon sun and the land would
suddenly be masked in darkness. Alex
took this as an omen that his grand-
mother was indeed dying. He kept his
eyes on the road.

He came to one junction of the road

over and squeezed her hand.
“She's all right mom, she probably just
didn‘t feel strong enough to answer it."
His words had a calming effect on his

mother and she gave him a small smile.

The words had an opposite effect on him

however. He didn‘t believe what he had

said for a minute, but theintense emotion
of his mother made him feel uneasy, so he
felt he had to say them. The man with the
red ﬂag signaled to Alex and he continued
on his way. He thought about death and
all the things he associated with it. When
he was a child his parents had taken him
to the funeral of his other grandmother.
She had looked serene lying there
amongst all those ﬂowers. The ﬂowers
had made Alex sneeze because he was
allergic to them. So he had waited outside
the parlor. The sight of his grandmother
dead did not trouble him as he waited for
his parents. For a longtime after that old
people. f uncrals. and ﬂowers were his im-
pression of death. He never thought
about death. Being young meant death
was far away. It was not until he was
twelve that he came to fear death. One of
his friends, Johnny Robbins, had been

out. Alex came out of his preoccupation
and slowed down for a car that Was pull-
ing on to the highway.

“I saw him.“ He said to her with a hint
of irritation.

He drove the car over the bridge
toward the city. Past the dull-brown
housing projects by the river, the hills of
the city grew. They were sparkled here
and there with the color of autumn trees.
He saw one hill which had Prospect Park
on it. Alex‘s mother had told him that was
where she had ﬁrst met his f other. playing
tennis. As he came to a halt at a trafﬁc
light. he gave her a short smile to relieve
the tension. She had never rc-marricd
after the divorce.

Alex began to think about his grand-
mother again as he started upthrough the
hills of the city. "Grammar". That was
what he called her when he was a child,
and he still called herthat. She's a strong
woman. he thought. She had been strong
during the thirties when Tom Ryan had
been laid off from the Day-Line. She had
opened a small fabric shop to support the
family. “We got by, Alan, thanks to the
lord,“ she would say of that time. She
always called him “Alan” because that
had been her father's name.
