First in a series on Johnny Carson

There was a time, during my formative years. that I
would watch the Dick Cavett Show religiously. If I was
going to watch ,TV at all, it was an educational obliga-
tion to myself to gt something out of it. Forthis reason
I also refused to watch Johnny Carson.

My parents watched Johnny Carson. My grand-
parents watched Johnny Carson. lﬁgured out, with my
anticstablishment mind of yore, that if they liked him. I
deﬁnitely could not.

Now. Dick Cavett was the best television interviewer.
He somehow made plugs for albums and books into in-
teresting, entertaining shows. But if the set was shut off
before the end of the show. I would feel that I had
wasted my time. Each show had a loose theme, it was a
whole entity. And if I stopped watching in the middle. I
would go to sleep unfulﬁlled. So. if I knewl wasn't go-
ing to stay up, I stopped watching altogether. Now if I
didn't want to go to sleep at l l:30 and I wanted to watch
TV. I had only one recourse. watchthe beginning of the

The success of the Johnny Carson's Tonight Show
revolves around this idea. You can tune in at 12:30 and
be entertained. Because of the lack of coherence, any
time is the right time. It is one of thefew shows onthe air
that can claim this distinction. You don‘t have to be in
on the beginning to know if the show is going to be

good.

You already know whatto expect. Someone will sing,
someone will be smart. someone will tell jokes, someone
will insult the President. someone will have big breasts,
someone will have written a book, someone will men-
tion love or peace. someone will have to run. someone
will have a mood 'ring. someone will wear leather pants,
someone will be into astrology. someone will mention
Ed‘s drinking, someone will be divorced. someone will
dojust one more song. someone will tell Doc how great

rather dry piece, which gave the per-

totally to the viola‘s character.

that the friend of Robespierreshould

shared his love of Classical antiquity
and held the ofﬁcial title of First
Consul at one time.

Many of his paintings dealt with

of hemlock. Socrates is actually
shown stretching out his hand over
the cup. The whole composition is
much quieter than that ofthe Sabine
Women. but is filled with pathosand
controlled anguish. David is noted
for his depicting of dramatic
moments and for his ability to
arouse emotion. Both qualities are
displayed in these two paintings.

The Death of Socrates was
produced in 1787. almost on the
threshold of the revolution. It is not
hard to speculate upon the lessons
which David was tryingtotcach. Of
course David‘s Greek and Roman
paintings contain anachronisms and
show perhaps unjustiﬁed idealiza-
tion. But the artist was for his own
age making a constructive use of
Classical themes.
