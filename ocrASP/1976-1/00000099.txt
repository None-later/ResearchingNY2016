half-way out of the den.

Alex balanced the ladder. It was used
for pickingap'ples and ’so it came toa point
at the to .‘H
the second‘story.

“I don’t think you can get in through

.those windows," the landlord called up.

“I haven’t heard her move around all
day,” conﬁded the downstairs neighbor.

Two children who were playing in the
next yard stopped and came over to
watch. Alex heard his mother call up to
him, “Be careful Alexi" He was slightly
irritated,“She still thinks I'm a child,” he
thought. He pulled on the screen and
almost lost his balance. Hethen pulled on
the window until he could ﬁt his hand in.
He uncranked the window until it was
open all the way. Then he climbed
through into the kitchen.

His feet struck the linoleum with a
thud. Dirt came off his soles onthe clean
ﬂoon

He froze and listened. No sound. He
had been in such a hurry to get in, but
now, he froze in his steps. He looked

toward the hall way to his grandmother's
bedroom. “Why me?” he thought as he
looked at his dirt on the floor. “Why do I
have to be the one that ﬁnds her?" He felt
a litttle ashamed and then the words came
to him, “jerked-up", “jerked-up!" He hit
on his tip as his heart began to race. He
started toward the hallway. “This is it.“ he

and over. No answer. ‘The lines onyhis
mother’s face began to stand out more
and more as the silence continued. He
hung the phone up. v .

“My wife tells me your mother's sick."
The landlord began as he entered the den.
“I‘m sorry, but I- don’t have apass-key.“

“She doesn't answer!” Alex's mother
cried out. “How do we get in?" She began
to sob. The landlord's wife came over to
comfort her as her husband explained to
Alex. “I make it my policy. . . you know,
some tenants get touchy about it."

Alex looked at him with annoyance
and suspicion. He didn't like landlords
and he never heard of one that respected
his tenants’ wishes.

“Do you have a ladder?” Alex asked the
older man.

“My sister has a key!" His mother
suddenly blurted out. “ But she's at work."

said just above his breath.

He walked straight to his grand-
mother's room and entered through the
open door with his eyes on the floor. He
pulled up his eyes quicklyto the bed. His
grandmother was curled-up on the bed.
She looks so small, he thought. Her hand
was tucked under her chin, the way a child
might sleep. Her white hair whisped up
around her face. On her night table, a
statue of Christ's mother stood; her palms
held out. Alex sat down on the bed. He
felt a strange surge of strength inside him.
A rosary was wrapped around her

ﬁngers. “There's no god.” he thought.
“Just life, just death." Then he reached
over and touched her hand. She suddenly
stirred and jerked her head up. Alex lept
up quickly from the bed. His mouth fell
open. "Grammar!" He muttered out loud.

His grandmother rubbed her eyes and
focused them on him.

“Alan . . . Alan you’ve come to visit
me." She spoke softly from her pillow.

Alex almost started to laugh, but he
broke down into a smile.

“Yeah.” He answered as he heard his
mother rapping on the front door.
