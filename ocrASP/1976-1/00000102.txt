- ' My. howvclose it was! But for the
Albany Great Dane varsity basket?
ball team, the 78—76 loss to the
Plattsburgh Cardinals at University
Gym Wednesday night was not close
enough.

Albany‘s heartbreaking loss left
them with a 5—3 record in the State
University of New York Athletic
Conference race and all but
eliminated any hopes they had of
copping the crown. Overall. the
Danes now have a 9—l0 record and
are in danger of ﬁnishing underthe
.500 mark fortheﬁrsttimeinthe 20-
year career of head coach Doctor
Richard Sauers.

The win gives Plattsburgh a 6—l
conference mark and leaves them
only a half game behind front-
running Oneonta State.

But for the Cardinals head coach
Norm Law, it wasn't easy to ac-
compiish.

“‘i didn't think we were going to
win it." he said. “The turning point
was the jump ball.”

The situation was this: with
Plattsburgh ahead by a 72—67
margin with l:36 left in the game.
Albany center Barry Cavanaugh and

 

   

up  To 5-3 in  Race

'Plattsubrgh forward Darryl Hutson
tied each other up scrambling for a
loose ball. Cavanaugh Won the tip
and - it appeared Albany's Steve
Macklin would reach it ﬁrst in the
Dane backcourt. But Plattsburgh‘s
Mike Green came out of nowhere,
outraced Macklin forthc ball, drove,
scored, and was fouled on the play.
He converted the free throw. and
now with l23l left in the game. the
hosts trailed by eight.

“That was the big play.” echoed
Sauers. "We had the momentum, we
had them playing scared. and we had
a good shot at winning it. We could
have cut the lead to three. but in-
stead. they- (Plattsburgh) made it.
and we're down by eight."

The Danes still made quite a run at
it. though. immediately following
that play, Albany's Vic Cesare
hauled down an offensive rebound,
threw up a right-handed semi-hook,
banked it in. and was fouled. The
three-point play cut the gap to ﬁve
and Kevin Keane's succeeding hoop
cut it to three with 53 seconds
remaining. But that wasasclose as
they got.

Tom Rice's layup put the Car-
dinals back up by ﬁve, and Hutson's,

free throw with eight seconds left ‘

proved to be too much to overcome.
Cesare's two buckets—the last one
coming at the buzzer—just made the
ﬁnal score that much closer.

in fact. the beginning of the game

was just as wild as the end. Albany
jumped out to a quick lead when
Winston Royal snared a foul-line
jumper. But Plattsburgh came right
back and tied it when center Steve
Parker reached over Cavanaugh for
a game-tying hoop. Bob Audi then
converted an Albany layup. and
when Royal stole the inbounds pass
and scored, suddenly it was a 6—2
game. ‘
Hutson's two quick buckets tied it
once more but Royal's foul-line
swish kept the hosts on top. Three
more Royal baskets. a Cesare layup.
and a Mike Suprunowicz backdoor
bucket. opened up a six-point
Albany lead with ll:l5 remainingin
the ﬁrst half.

But then the Cardinals began to
claw—their way back. With Parker
starting to control the boards, the
visitors opened up their fast-break
running show and now it was a high-
noon shootout.

Track Club Third in Union-Colgate Meet

by Ken ifth

This past Saturday. the Albany
State indoor Track Club ﬁnished
third in a triangular meet at Union
College Fieldhouse behind Union
(59) and Colgate (55).

Albany scored 23 points. “The
team scored only ten points in the
meet last year. and the improvement
this year would have been much
better if our hurdlers had been
there." said Albany coach Doug
Allen. (Jim Pollard, Dave Cole, and
Dan Johnson all missed the meet due
to illness.)

The highlight of the meet was the

performance of Brian Davis in the
two mile race. Davis‘ winning time
(9:li.5) is one of the best in New
York State this winter. and is one se-
cond off Jim Schraeder‘s record.
Carlo Cherubino took third in the
race. and will run for Albany again
this weekend.

and with 5:36 left, the score was
knotted at 30. Cavanaugh's ten-foot
jumper quickly undid the knot. but
when Plattsburgh reeled off the next
seven points. it was the beginning of
the end for Albany. Wright's steal
and driving layup gave Plattsburgh
its ﬁrst lead at 34—32, and his squad
was never to be headed again.
Wright‘s 20-foot jumper gave the
Cardinals a ﬁve point lead with l: l5

ABC Knocks Off. Pups

by David Levy

Jim Keenan scored 28 points and
Terry Marblcy 2i as the Albany
Business College uvcnged an earlier
defeat at the hands of the Albany
State Junior Varsity Basketball
team. handing the Pups their second
loss in l3 games. 82~e74 at Universi-
ty Gym Wednesday night.

The 6 foot 9 inch Keenan
repeatedly used his exceptionally
long arms to good advantage as he
reached over the i’ups for easy
rebounds and short jump shots.

“We just didn't play well at all.“
said Pups coach Bill Austin. “It was
easily our sloppiest game of the
your.“ Citing Keenan. he also
criticized his team‘s luck ofdcfcnsivc
rebounding.

Staton Winston led the Pups with
2| points. l5 coming in the second
half as he ran into foul trouble early
in the game. His shot selection was
not the best and he often met
resistance from the leaping ABC
players who were called for ﬁve
goultcnding violations.

Earlier this season the Pups hild
beaten ABC. 75-——72. “Murblcy had
38 against us last time but wcshut off
the rest." Austin said. “Tonight
Keenan and Mnrbley both hurt us.“

When asked ifthc loss of Winston
Royal to the Varsity hurt, Austin‘s
only reply was a sighing “un-
questionably."

The ll—2 JV has six remaining
games beginning Saturday at Cor-
ncil.

Volleyball Club Tames Union, RPI

by David Levy

The Men's Volleyball Club open-
ed its season with two victories,
defeating Union l5——3. 15—10. i5~
6 and RPI l5——8. l5—l0, l5—6.

The Club was led by Jamie Msc-
Fttrland. 'who Couch Ted Earl has
called "a potential Olympian." His
court play was instrumental in the
Union win as he consistently spiked
over. around and through the op~
ponent's blocks.

Despite injury problems which
kept Muanrland on the bench and
hampered Captain Dwight Buck. it
was success at RPI. The tenuncious
defense of RPi forced State into an
“off-speed" attack that provided the
margin of victory. ‘

Freshman Andy Kinstler played a
"super game" at Rl’l. said Earl. and

earned the match MVP honors.

Earl feels the club has yet to sel-

”Wc‘re not playing good, team
ball yet. We have a habit of going to
Jamie nnd(5 fcct 9inchcs. 140 pound
Patrick) Dwyer too much."

The club has all its matches
videotaped and spends Thursdays
reviewing post efforts. Earl cites this
as one reason forthe"50 percent im-
provement in play over the past
week."

Big Match

No post-season play is allowed for
Club teams. so the big match of the
year shapes up as the West Point
Quudranguiar in March. The next
match following Union last night is
at New Paltz. The Club returns
home March ii to face Herkimer
Community College.

Task Force Suggests Extensive Cuts

by Daniel Gaines

SUNYA will lose three doctoral
programs, ﬁve master‘s programs
and eight undergraduate programs
over the next few years if President
Emmett B. Fields follows all the
recommendations made in his Task
Force's report released today.

[Tire Complete Task Force
Report is reproduced in it special sec-
tion inside today‘s ASP]

The thirteen-member committee
evaluated every segment of the un-
iversity. No faculty member would
be rctrenchcd for the l976-77 year
under their plan. and they sought to
permit enrolled students to finish
their present programs.

Evaluations were made in light of
SUNYA‘s $l.3 million out in the
state budget proposal Governor
Hugh L. Carey gave to the
legislature.

The Task Force recommended
eliminating all degree programs in
Nursing. Speech Pathology, Art
History. Comparitive Literature.
ltalian. Environmental Studies.

inter-American Studies, and
Astronomy and Space Science. Also
suggested were climinaii‘o'ns of doc-
toral programs in Classics. French
and Romance Languages.

The full report and recommen-
dations of the Task Force will be
reviewed by the University Senate‘s
Council on Education Policy and the
Executive Committee. Those com-
mittees will consider responses of
affected programs. They will f oward
their recommendations to President
Fields by March 5, whothen has un-
til Murch l5 to make the final
decisions.

“The. Task Force has carried out
its demanding charge with com-
petence and conscience,“ wrote
Fields on the report‘s cover letter.
“its work will enable the campus not
only to chart its course through the
severe straits of immediate
budgetary cuts but also to reach
toward the future with promise of
conﬁdence and strengh."

Fields directed the Task Force to
use five criteria: quality, centrality

Flip Top Drive Based

by Stephen Dzlnanka

SUNYA‘s liiptop saving cam-
paign designed to raise money for
the purchase of a kidney machine
may end up in the can.

Signs have been posted all over
campus urging people to save ﬂip-
tops; “One million ﬂip-tops equals
one kidney machine."However. Ex-
ecutive Director of the Albany
Kidney Foundation Torn Kcrnan
told the Albany Student Press that
drives aimed at buying and donating
kidney machines. or raising monies
to buy time on machines for patients.
will prove futile. Kernnn explained
that tiny kidney patient who needs
dialysis treatment is covered under
medicaid/medicare and receives
treatment which is funded by the
state or federal government.

Kcrnan said that hospitals cannot
accept funds for the purpose of
purchasing a kidney machine. He

added that private machines for use
in the homes of patients aresuppiicd
by the state.

“People are covered,"said Ker-
nun. “A patient never shells money
out of his pocket for dialysis . . . it's
not that sort of an ugly thing
anymore where people go without
treatment.“

Student Brian Lucas brought the
idea of a ﬂip-top saving campaign to
SUNYA. He said that he found out
about it through a few different peo-
ple. including his brother. “i don't
really have any deﬁnite informa-
tion." said Lucas.

Livingston Tower Residence
Director Vul iiodge helped Lucas
organize a system of collecting the
ﬂip-tops through the Residence 0i-
i'tce. An announcement was put in a
newsletter published by the
Residence Ofﬁce urging that flip-
tops be saved towards the purchase

(essential need for program inn un-
iversity). public policy (support

programs working in areas of '

political. social. and economic). stu-
dent demnnd. and cost.

A brief summary of the report
follows. Please note, however. that
the context for each decision is com-
plicated. and better understood by
reading the report itself, inside this
issue.

Schools not mentioned in the
following summary are essentially
unaffected bythe Task Force report.

SUMMARY:
Iluriianities:

Art History-Cut M.A. & B.A.,
student demand declining. A small
number of faculty may be needed for
Studio Art and others.

CIGIIICI-Cut Ph.D. because too
much maintenance required in light
of low need. Maintain M.A. &B.A.
Comparltlve Literature-Terminate
B.A.. M.A. Sustaining would need
reorganization, leadership, student
interest and increased expenditures.

0n Rumor

of a kidney machine. Hodge said
that no ﬂip-tops will be sent out until
an ofﬁcial letter is received describ-
ing the specifics of the deal. Until
then. she can see no harm in con-
tinuing to collect the flip-tops.

The Kidney Foundation has run
into similar situations where in-
dividuals organized to savefiip-tops,
cans. cigarette wrappers. etc. with
the hopes of raising money to buy a
kidney machine. Kernan said
rumors that they can do this are
totally false. “Rumors just seem to
grow." said Kernan. “people think
it's a great idea." Kernan attributed
part of the problem to the misinfor-
mation people how about the status
of kidney disease and its trcutment in
the United States today.

The legislation ensuring dialysis
treatment for all kidney patients was
passed as an amendment (HRJ) to
the Social Security Act.

These steps are unlikely and not
feasible. Phase out over two years.
English-Cut four faculty lines —-
status depends on Ph.D.
French-Cut Ph.D. over next few
years. Reduce two lines in 1977-78.
Italian-Cut by ‘78 the master's and
bachelor's. High cost. small‘ enroll-
ment. .Reccnt evaluations say quality
is mixed. and many similar
programs in state.
Theatre/Music-Both presently un-
dergoing evaluation; cut two lines
between the two ofthem. Generous
student-faculty ratios and financial
constraints. ,
Romance Language Ph.D.-
Terminate. Few st udcnts. little need.
Social and Behavioral:

Afro-Am. studies-Reduce by one
line. Light workload.
Anthropology-This strong
program can absorb a temporary
reduction without harm. Borrow
one faculty line.

Economies-Add one line. Excellent
leadership. improving faculty. Un-
derstaffcd.

Geography-Borrow one line for
one year. Consider adding an ad-
ditional line also.

History-Add lines over next two
years. support Ph.D. possibility.
Psychology-Add one line. for
workload and centrality.

Puerto Rican Studies-Cut one
line. and consider cutting a second if
enrollments do not improve.
Environmental studies-Terminate
program. Too fragmented and dif-
fuse for needed specialization.
Financial constrainsts prevent ex-
pnnsion.

Inter-American Studies-
Tcrininate B.A. and Latin American
M.A. Rest of program satisfactory.

Science and Marhemallcr:
Autonomy-Terminate B.S.
Retrenchment last year means there
is only one professor.
Atmosphere-Cut two lines. in View
of overstafiing and potential capaci-

ty.

Computer-Add two lines. High
workload.

Mathematics-Can manage with

slight diminution of resources. Cut
one position. Also, there is a small
number of graduate students.
Physics-Cut one faculty line.
Education-Shift generally away
from professional tcachereducation.
Speech Pathology-Phase out
bachelor‘s and master's programs.
Needs additional resources which
are not available in forseeable
future. Evaluators raised serious
questions.

Bualnou-Add three lines. Severely
understaffed. Develop graduate
programs, control undergraduate
enrollments. The proportion of
graduates to undergraduates should
be increased over time.

Library and information-Cut one
line. borrow another-but return it.
Nuralng- Phase out over four years.
Commitment of needed additional
resources not possible. Maintenance
of undergraduate program would re-
quire better physical facilities and
there is no money for master‘s.
Political Science-Add one line if
progress is made.

Public Administration-Add two.
maybe four faculty lines. Growing
demand. understaffed. taking ad-
vantage of Albany.
Social Welfare-Add
warranted.
