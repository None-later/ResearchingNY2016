by William German

Students from across the state met
at SUNY Binghamton last weekend
for a NYPlRG Conference. The
students. 120 in total, represented
many facets of consumer and en-
vironmental issues, and spent the
weekend attending workshops and
lectures.

Altogether. 17 schools were
represented. SUNYA's delegation of
22 students made it the largest in
attendance.

Friday night was reserved for get-

omcampus 5...... s...

by Merle Abrams

The Ofﬁce of Residences at
SUNYA has recently completed a
survey of off-campus students "in an
effort to obtain information on
where students are living and what
problems they are facing in locating
housing," according to John Welly.
Director of Residences.

The survey. conducted from Nov.
3—21. 1975, also soughtto determine
what changes have occurred in off-
cttmpus living since the last survey
was completed in fall of 1971.

Students were asked to respondto
qucstions concerningthc number of
people sharing the apartment or
house. the monthly rent. lease
period. number of bedrooms.
problems they encounter and their
mcrtns oftrttnsportntion. Additional
questions included whether the
apartment was furnished or unfur-
nishcd. the distance from campus
and whether or not they expected to
remain irt their present location.

Out of an estimated 8,553 off-

eampus students. 1.003 responded to
the survey and were categorized ac-
cording to. class status.

Those who tabulated the results
feel the survey was reasonably ac-
curate. since the percentage of
students responding in each group
corresponded closely with the
percentage of students in the total
population.

The Office of Residences sum»
marized the responses into a general,
“profile for the typical un-
dergraduate and graduate off-
campus students.“

For instance. considerable
differences were found to exist
between the type of living accom-
modations an undergraduate will
take compared tothetype ofhousing
a graduate student would tend to
choose.

According to the summary. the
typical off-campus undergraduate is

While responses ranged from

Testing Service Complaints Keep

by Randi ll. ’l‘olcr (SASU)

NYI’lRG‘s investigation of the
Educational Testing Service (ETS)
has received more ttllics than they
had hoped for. As ETS complaint
centers tally the several hundred
responses they have received. they
hztvc found that students from all
over Ilrc eager to complain about in—

have also come in from Tennessee.

several schools have set upthcir own
complaint centers in cooperation
with NYPlRG.

Brooklyn has received many long
letters uttuchedto the complaint
forms. and in several instances. the
dissatisﬁed customers have sent
NYPlRG copies of letters which
they had written tothcirlegislators.

The complaint forms often read
that ETS had failed to send an
applicant‘s scores to a school ontime
and consequently the student could
not qualify for admission. Otltcr
typical complaints were about in-
correct tcst ccntcr assignments and
lost transcripts. NYPlRG insists
that something must be done to
regulate this agency whose careless
errors can have sueh tt drastic effect
on their customers' lives.

Secret Finances

The Educational Testing Service
is a non-proﬁt educational organiza-
tion. Because of their non-profit
status. they are able to keep their
ﬁnancial status out ofthe public do
main. NYPlRGis ﬁghtingto require
ETS to disclose their ﬁnances. The
ETS tests cost from $6.50 to $27.00

way to regulate their prices.
Although they are classified as a
non-profit organization. ETS’ in-
come has doubled every ﬁve years
since its inception in 1948.

Alan Greenberg. a NYPlRG
member who is working out of the
Albany office is tryingto arrangefor
hearings before the State
Legislature. He is optimisticthot the
Senate Committee on Higher
Education will grant his request, but
he does not think that the hearings
will be able to be scheduled until
March or April.

Meanwhile Cohen says that NYP-
lRG is planning for specific legisla-
tion which they feel would mztkc
them more accountable tothe people
rising their services.

The ﬁrst type of legislation that
NYPlRG hopes to see initiated is a
truth in testing law. This would re-
quire ETS to provide certain cx—
planations to the test taker at thctop
of each test.

ETS would have to inform its
customers who developed the test.
where the test results would be sent.
the predicted validity of the test. and
the percentage of the test which is ex-
perimental. Cohen feels that this
legislation would have the best
chance of passing because it does not
require any additionalexpenditures.

the student's monthly rental costs.

The survey also found that ap-
proximately ltalf of the off-campus
students encountered difﬁculty in
locating off-campus housing. while
1 1% of the students encountered cx-
tremc difﬁculty.

Financial difﬁculty is the greatest
problem that off—campus students
face. according to the summary.
Problems with landlords. utilities
and transportation follow in this

Com ing in

The second type oflcgislationthat
NYPlRG is pushing for seeks to
protect students from college ad-
missions ofﬁccrs who do not usethc
tests fairly. Many Schools have a set
cut-off score needed for admission.
ETS admits that u difference in two
scores of 66 points is completely in-
significant and one Score should not
be favored overthc other. However,
colleges. law schools and graduate
schools repeatedly judge strictly by
the reported scores with little regard

to the fact that a score of 600 is ac- .

tuttlly no better than a score of550.

Better Guidelines
NY PIRG wants to regulate abuse

of the ETS scores by ﬁrst requiring
that ETS establish better guidelines
for score interpretation. Secondly. if
a school is found to continually
abuae the test scores, that school
should be withheld scores of
applicants and they should not be
allowad to use ETS scores as a basis
for admission.

In a meeting with ETS. NYPlRG
was asked why they were attacking
the Educational Testing Service.
Cohen answered that their purpose
is not to attack the corporation.
NYPlRG's goal is to ﬁndthe flaws in
their operations and to open to the
public a very important. very secret
organization.

category. Some examples that
students cited ranged from a
landlady who threatened a tenant's
boyfriend with a shotgun. to “ex-
tremely and unexpectedly high oil
bills."

The typical off-campus graduate
student was found to pay slightly
higher monthly rent. more likely to
take an unfurnished apartment
further away from campus. and
would probably drive to school
rather than use the university bus.

In comparing this survey withthat
of 1971. the Ofﬁce of Residences
found two major changes:

OWhilc monthly rental rates
averaged from $40-$60 per month in
the fall of 1971. the average range of
monthly rates in the fall of 1975 was
$60-$90.

0Also, a higher percentage of un-
dcrgraduate off-campus students

,‘ now use the university bus service.

The summary cited several
recommendations being made based
on the results of this survey. One of
these suggestions is‘anincreascd un-
iversity effort in making information
available to students about ﬁnancial
aid and part-time work." Also being
considered is the feasibility of mak-
ing public transportation available
to students.

Further study is planned to ex-
amine ways students canlearn about
available housing and their rights as
tenants. Presently. students may ob-
tain a list of landlords, rooms.
apartments or houses available from
the off-campus housing office. The
off-campus housing newsletter and
“A Guide of Off-Campus Living"
provide additional information to
the student on legal aspects of the
tenant-landlord relationship and
how to handle the typical problems
one encounters off-campus.

One senior who had difﬁculty with
his landlady recommends the Stu-
dent Association lawyer who“was a
great help in clarifying what my
rights are as a tenant."
