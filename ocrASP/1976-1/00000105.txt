The SUNYA Inﬁrmary reporteda
capacity number of ﬁlled beds dur-
ing the worst stage of the current in-
fluenza epidemic.

38 patients ﬁlled the Inﬁrmary to
its limits. whilethe medical staff was
hard pressed to keep pace between
February 9 and II. The number of
out-patients was greater and the ma-
jority of stricken students did not
report in at all.

Dr. Rudolph Schmidt of thelrtlir-
mary says the ﬂu disease began
spreading immediately following
Christmas vacation. He said it was
carried into the state by returning
travelers.

Schmidt explained that the con-
tagious disease hits the college cant-
pus very thoroughly due to the close
contact of dormitory living. SUNYA
however, has the advantage of dis-

_tance between the quads. “We are
more spread out”, said the doctor.

Other colleges were subject to
worse conditions—Hartwick
College in Oneonta is said to have
closed down for a day. while RPI
reports oneflu-casc which developed
into pneumonia.

Schmidt described the symptoms
common tothis type ofllu. Hesaidit
appears as a high fever which after
two days breaks to become a severe
cold involving headache and
coughing.

Love Affair Over

America‘s love affair with its
public school system is over.

Only 13 percent of American
adults would grade their local
schools “A for excellent"-—a 30 per-
cent drop from ﬁve years ago—a re-
cent national survey conducted by
the Ford Foundation has found.

Many of the adults who voted
thumbs dowu on publicschools were
recent graduates from the public
school system. Only 6 percent of the
l8-29 year-olds and 9 percent of
those who have recently attended
college gave the schools a top rating,
afact whichthe survey report termed
a "warning signal" to schools.

Top on the list of dissatisfaction
was ‘lack of discipline.‘ followed by
‘bussing,’ ‘lack of financial support,’
'poor teachers.‘ ‘large-sized classes,’
‘poor curriculum,‘ and 'crime.‘

More than half ofthosc sampled
would like to send their children toa
special school that maintained tight
discipline. a strict dress code and
emphasized the three R's.—CPS.

ELEMENTARY POT

Thirty-two fourth grade suspects
of a Riverton, Wyoming, school
have been caught growing marijuana
in their classroom.

Teachers and administrators at
Jefferson School in Riverton say the
pot had been growing in the fourth
grade room for about four or five
months, but they claim that—until
recently— no one knew what the
plant was.

ANI-ACUPUNCTURE

An Illinois veterinarian says he
has been using acupuncture to treat
his dog. cat. and other non-human
patients.

Doctor Dennis Johnson of
Springﬁeld‘s Animal Medical Clinic
says he has been treatingtwotothrec
dogs and cats each day over the past
year with acupuncture. Johnson says
he at first probes the animals for pain
with a small device called an
acuprobe, and then treats the injured
animals with acupuncture needles.

Johnson sttys the most common
ailment his patients suffer from are
spinal problems. The veterinarian
says since he has been practicing the
acupuncture, he has delivered ll
number of puppies and kittens by
Cesarean Birth, painlessly. without
medical complications and without
anesthetics.

One of Johnson’s patients. an
almost crippled horse called “No
Bet“-—-reccntly set a new record in
the California Racing Season after
being treated for spinal injuries with
acupuncture.

DRUNKARD SNAILS

Britain's Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has put a traveling cabaret act—
which featured three beer-drinking
snails —on the wagon.

The act featured thrcc giant foot-
long African snailsinamcd Ger-

onimo. Monty and Big Fred—who
guzzled beer for spectators. .

The chief inspector for the
S. P. C. A. agreed that the snails were
“The biggest african snails I have
ever seen. “But.” he warned, “beer
drinking is unnatural. Alcohol could
poison the snails.“

Geronimo. Monty and Big Fred
were forced to give up booze last
week. The snails are now guzzling
milk.

CLOGGED STANCE

College Press Service reports that
among the 87 candidates ofﬁcially
running for President this year is
Ernest Whitford, who sees his mttin
platform as constipation.

Constipation, according to Whil-
ford, is the number one cause of ii-
lness in the U.S. and is triggered by
too mttny refined foods. if elected,
Whitford promises to cure the
problem by rcquiringfood manufac-
turers to add bran and roughage to
all their processed foods.

COMPU-DETECTIVE

The Government is perfecting a
bizarre new system that uses a com-
puter to recognize the faces of sub-
jects wanted by police.

The magazine. Carri/)ulerworltl,

Iy have to describe what the ettepect _

looked like to a computer—fend that
the machine will do'the rest.

The ’University of Houston is
reportedly working under a $226,000
grant from the Government to
perfect the system, known as
“Pattern Recognition.”

Computerworld says that the
computer, after “listening” to the
description, will search its memory
and print out the pictures of all
suspects possibly matching the
witness‘s description. The witness
would then select which of the pic-
tures most resembles the subject.

HAPPY FATTIES
A London psychiatrist is repor-
ting that being fttt may not beso un-

Doctor A.H. Crisp, a London
Medical School professor, says he

has found that fat people are much "‘ 7

less anxious and depressed than
others in the general population.

Doctor Crisp reports giving a
standard psychological exam to 739
middle aged women and men: 238 of
the subjects were at least 40 percent
overweight.

Crisp says that his portlysubjccts
were at least 40 percent less anxious

study.

The doctor suggests that
overeating consoles people with anx-
ictics and that fat people may not be
be beautiful. but they are content.
