Finishing uptheir i975-76scason,
the Albany State Women’s Swim-

r mingand Divingteam‘s record of 0-8

does little to reflect the actual ability
of the swimmers and divers who

' competed for Albany, according to

coach Leslie Hoar.

“We are very pleased with their ef-
forts," said Hoar. “those that
withstood the season improved'com-
mendably; the differences in their
beginning times and those of the
season's end clearly show their ad-
vancements'."

On February l7. the aquawomen
wound up the season dropping their
eighth meet to Onconta. 63-66, giv-
ing the upstaters a record of I win
and 7 losses.

“We were fairly well matched."
continued Hoar. “and considering
we had to fill in the gaps. the team
did a fairly goodjob".

ZOO-yd. free style captured by Kathy
Maioney and Sherri Cassutoforthe

50-yd. butterﬂy. I’zll Dillon and
Wendy Kloesz in first and second in
the lWyd. backstroke and the 500-
