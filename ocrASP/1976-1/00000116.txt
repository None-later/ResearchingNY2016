Chancellor Views SUNY Cuts

  

Carey is doing what must be done
statewide to meet head-on the financial
situation. Adjustments must be made at
every level and the University is deter-
mined to accept austerity to bring fiscal
stability to New York State.

“At the same time the University has
been hard hit. We cannot continue to
drain the resources of SUNY and keepits
vitality intact. The moves we are now
forced to ntakc --on top of the cuts
already suffered» force the University to
exhaust all possibilities for signiﬁcant
savings and increasing income consistent
with its scope and public mission.
Another round of budget cuts would
force further drastic action that will have
statewide implications as well as harming
specific communities.“

"lt‘s time to reaffirm that highcreduca-
tion is not a luxury but a necessity in this
State. New York. like all leading states.

SUNY Chancellor Boyer

 

 

The proposed 1976-77 Executive
budget will severely hurt State University
of New York by cutting back on SUNY
enrollment. eliminating educational
programs and medical services. and
sharply increasing the cost to students.
according to Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer.

Chancellor Boyer said that the propos-
ed reduction in the SUNY budget:
OReduces enrollment by 5.000 students
below current levels at State-operated

Budgetary Bureaucracy

The New York State budgetary process
is long and complex. Basically. it goes like
this:

1. Each individual SUNY school
prepares and presents a budget to the
SUNY Cetneral Administration.

2. SUNY Central compiles and
changes the budgets from each of the
campuses and presents at SUNY budget to
the Division of the Budget (DOB).

3. The DOB drafts the Executive State
Budget. This is the budget that the Gover-
nor presents to the New York State
Legislature for approval in mid-January.

4. The Governor has until mid-
February to amend the budget. After
that. it is in the hands of the Legislature.
The Legislature has until the end of

March to pass to budget.

This year. the Governor has asked that

the budget be passed by March l5 so the
State‘s credit rating will be good in order
to sell bonds.

Through this point we can have little
effect upon the budget because the
legislature can only make cuts. not ad-
ditions on the Executive Budget.

Unlike the Federal Government which
usually works with a deficit budget. the
State must have a balanced budget.

As the last act of the session. the
Legislature passes the Supplemental
Budget. It is at this time that they would
appropriate additional funds to specific
State agencies. They can also earmark
funds for a specific institution (e.g..
SUNY at Albany) but not fora specific
program. To have the greatest impact. we
must concert our efforts toward the
Supplemental Budget.

What You Can Do

lfwe are concerned about the fate ofthe University. and the opportunity for students
to have a low cost. high quality education. we must take action. Short of coming to
Albany or in some other way directly communicating your concern to legislators.
writing letters has proven to be successful.

During first year's budgetary crisis for SUNY. more letters were written front people
attached to SUNY at Albany than any other unit of the University. Consequently.
SUNYA was the recipient ofthe largest supplemental appropriationinthc system. We
urge you to write as soon as possible. It. will only take a few minutes and the fate ofthe

University may hang in the balance.

When writing to a legislator. we suggest:
I. The writer should identify himself/herself as a faculty member. or student. or
parent of a student attending or teaching at the State University of New York at

Albany.

2. The writer should identify his/ her respective legislator by including his, her voting

address.

3. The writer should explain personal concerns regardingimplications oftlte proposed
budget including drawing from impact on onc‘s personal situation whenever

applicable. e.g..

l .

cutback in TAP awards:

02.97

increase in tuition. room rertt and other fees;

$l.3 million in total funds cut from SUNYA‘s 1976-77 operating budget;
elimination of 1] academic programs and weakening of many others;

. a total of 88 staff positions eliminated. 27 of them faculty litres;

‘. rise iti SUNYA‘s faculty-student ratio from l5.5 to 16.];

g. any additional facts that can be found throughout this paper or elsewhere.

4. Ask the legislator to oppose any cuts from the SUNY section of the Executive
budget this month and to support additional funds for SUNY in the Supplemental

Budget at the end of the legislative session.

5. Thank the legislator for his her time ttnd ask for a reply iftlie lcgisltitorcan find the

time. Thank himi her for whatever support hctshc can give to your position.

l’urlltt'r N4)I('.\‘

Writingto your OWN Assembly representative and State Senator will probably have
the most impact as they need your vote and this is art election year (facts of wlticltthey
need not and should not be reminded). Threatening will get you nowhere. Facts. the

informed letter. carefully written can do thc most good.
