Last Monday students and
faculty members met here during
the afternoon in the campus
center ballroom to make plansto
ﬁght the SUNY budget cuts on a
university-wide level.

Assemblyperson Sy Posner
(D-L. Bronx), who chairs the
Assembly Labor Committee
spoke to the audience. He
strongly encouraged everyone at
SUNYA to participate in the
struggle to restore the SUNY
budget, and to do everything
possible within the system, in-
cluding letter-writing and visting
ley'slators en masse.

“To say that it [the legislative
process] doesn't work is really
turning the battleﬁeld overto the
hands of the enemy.“ Posner
said.

SASU Legislative Director
Joyce Chupka pointed out that
“All the State agencies are being
axed. but SUNY is the worst."
She spoke of the I0% reduction
in TAP (Tuition Assistance
Program) awards. the SUNY tui-
tion increases. room rent in-
creases, and the terminations
and cutbacks in SUN Y academic
programs. .

Chupka mentioned that
SASU will be leading a lobbying
effort early next week im-
mediately preceding the mass
demonstration. but she said.
“that isn't enough”. and
emphasized that the high visibili-
ty of thousands of students out-
side the Capitol would addtothe
effectiveness of the lobbying ef-
fort.

Other speakers discussed how
the cuts are being dealt with on
the campus level here. Peter
Cocks of UUP(Union of Univer-
sity Professionals) criticized
President Fields' Task Force and

 

Meeting Plans Actions

the manner in which the ad-
ministration has chosen to deal
with the budget.

“There is more than one
parallel between what Fields is
doing on this campus and what
Nixon’ did with Watergate,“
Cocks said.

Cocks feels that there should
be more university-wide par-
ticipation in policy‘making at
SUNYA and that “there should
be no decisions made behinds
closed doors" by adminstrators
who would conceal information
and then admonish critics of
their decisions for not having
enough information.

Another problem Cocks sees
here is the lack of unity among all
persons in the university. He
maintains that we all "have
become split rather than unified
on this issue" and that continued
fragmentation of special interest
groups within the university will
weaken any efforts to effectively
restore budget ctits.

David Coyne. Chairperson of
Central Council. expressed
similar feelings. Coyne said that
we all have to “work
cooperatively“ in seeking a
supplemental appropriation
from the State Legislature after
the Governor‘s budget is passed
this month. He also suggested
developing a mechanism her:
whereby there would be more
student and faculty input into
“ensuring that supplemental
funds won‘t go to programs
already in existence."

Like many others. Coyne feels
that in the event that more
money were appropriated to
SU NY Albany President Fields
would not guarantee that it
would be used to restore
programs recently recommended
for termination or retrenchment.

NCAA vs. Title IX

The National Collegiate
Athletic Association has gone to
court to try to have inter-
collegiate athletics excluded
from the guidelines the federal
government issued last summer
for enforcing an ante-sex-bias
law.

Charging that the Department
of Health. Education, and
Welfare exceeded its authority
and the intent of Congress by in-
cluding athletics in its
regulations for enforcing Title
IX of the Education
Amendments of I972. the
association asked the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for Kansas to in—
validate either all the regulations
or at least the sections dealing
with athletics and to enjoin the
department from enforcing
them.

Title IX forbids sex dis-
crimination in federally assisted
educational programs.

The iissociations‘s lawsuit con-
tains many of the contentions
that the organization put before
Congress last summer in an un-
successful attempt to convince
lawmakers ot exclude athletics
from the guidelines:

. I'liat athletics do not receive
direct federal aid and thus should
not be- include under the
coverage of the law.

O'I'hiit the department unlaw-
liilly interpreted the law to in-
cliidc programs that “benefit
from“ federal aid. while the law
itself only mentions progiams
that “receive and."

'l’hiit by requiring athletic
scholarships to be distributed in
proportion to the numbers of
men and women piiriiCIparing in
intercollegiate sports. the
regulations would force the use
of “arbitrary quota standards.
without regard to the relative
academic and athletic skills of
male and female candidates."

Him the standards set out in

the regulations for determining
whether a particular institution
provides equal opportunity "are
so vague and indefinite as to per-
mit virtually unfettered and un-
impeded discretion? to the
Department of Health. Educa—
tion. and Welfareto decidethat a
violation exist.

During Congressioal hearings
last summer. opponents of the
N.C.A.A. position argued that
“Congress did not intend to in-
itiate a federal policy of giving
federal assistance to an institu-
tion which discrminatcs in some
areas although not in others." in
the words of Bernice Sandlcr.
director of the Project on the
Status and Education of Women
at the Association of American
Colleges.

“It is clear.“ she said. that
federal support for various
programs often enables
“instituions to support
numerous other school activities,
such as athletic programs and ex-
tracurricular activities.“

In addition to the legal issues.
the athletic association's suit says
that the Title IX regulations re-
quire N.C.A.A. members to
“make substantial changes in the
organi/ation. operation. and
budgeting of their individual iii—
tercollegizitc athletic programs.
that they engage in time-
consuming programs of self—
evaluation. and that they
otherwise conduct their inter—
collegiate athletic programs in
accordance with the arbitrary
and exacting requirements of the
regulations.“

"Most importantlu." said the
iissociaiioii. the regulations “in-
volvc the loss of freedom of in-
divtdual institutions to deter-
mine the education or ed ueiition-
related programs most suited to
[each‘. instiution. free
frominterference or regulation
by the federal government."

When one surveys the list of
budgetary cuts, reallocations. in-
creases, and redeployments,
several factors become evident.
Among the departments
recommended for termination or
phasing out are: Art history MA
and BA, Classics PhD, Com-
paritive literature MA and BA,
French PhD. Italian MA and
BA, Romance Language PhD.
Speech Pathology and
Audiology MS and BS. School
of Nursing BS. Environmental
Studies BA, Political Economy
MA. Astronomy BS. Inter-
American Studies. and Latin-
American Studies MA.

It is curious that the vast ma-
jority of these programs are
predominantly comprised of
women or Third Word students.
In addition. it is coincidental that
among the programs slated for
reductions are African and Afro-
American Studies and Puerto
Rican Studies.

On the other hand. among
those programs recommended

for increases are: Biology.
Chemistry. Geology,
Mathematics. Physics.

Geography, the School of
Business. the School of Criminal
Justice and the School of Public
Administration.

Should we question other
statistics. the situation becomes
even more convenient. Of the
Task Force. 14 faculty members
were male and l female. Do we
ponder the committee's decision.
when with few exceptions those
programs reduced orterminiited
were unrepresented on the Task
Force. (Not to mention that the
opposite istrue also.) No attempt
was made to reach aiiyt hing but
an academic balance. and even
this appears more than ii bit
shaky.

Of course all statistics are bias-
ed. and there are those who
would disagree with my position.
But can we afford to accept the
committee's decision at face
value. especially in light of the
implications of Title IX. It has
been openly admitted that those
programs that are to bc [cr-
minatcd or phased otit will
probably never again appear on
this campus, As members of ii
university community we must
question thcsc inconsistencies.
and make known our con-
clusions. As ii final warning—
hewarc-it is for too easy for sexist
as well as racist cuts. however un-
conscious. to be made iiiidci‘ the
guise of atistci‘itv.

distributed in proportion to ilic
number ofsttidents of each sex
participating in intercollegiate
sports. “a sex-based qtiotii
system for the awarding of
athletic scholarships. in Violation
of the basic prohibition of litlc
lX against classifications based
upon sex." will result. the
association charged.

“lt amounts. moreover. to .i
thinly disguised program to It‘-
quire affirmatch corrective ac
tion by educational institutions.
ii program which is neiihci
warranted by the facts noi
authoriled by Title IX.“ the
association said.
