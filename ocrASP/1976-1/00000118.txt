‘Rule number one is to be
there. What good is a mass
demonstration if there are no
masses? Obviously a handful of
students ‘will do little to effect
any sort of change in the budget
situation.

‘Your second responsibility is
to make sure all your friends
show up. even if it means dragg-
ing your roommate(orlover) out
of bed and convincing him/her
that if s/he doesn‘tjoin you. you
will never share your bone with
him/ her again.

"Another thing you might un-
dertake is attemptingto convince
your teachers tojoin the march.
This will be especially easy ifthey
are untenured or members of
departments slated to be ter-
minated next year and you make
a point of remindingthem oftlte
same. Having more than
students at the march and rally
will be good not only forthe sake
of numbers. but for building a
kind of morale and comeraderie
that has never really existed
before.

‘A deﬁnite must for the media
and any other folks we happen to
catch the eye of is to make
yourself a poster or sign. S.A.
will have a limited number
available, but you should have
no trouble making your own.
Poster paper is only 35¢ a sheet
inthe bookstore and most people
have magic markers handy. One
thing to remember is that the
police will not allow sheets and
signs to be carried on wooden or
metal sticks since this is a poten-
tial safety hazard. They will has—
sle you if you‘re caught so your
best bet is probably cardboard
rollers if you need something to
support your sign.

Some suggestions for slogans
are “You say out back. we say
fight back.“ “Defend public
higher education" “Cut ad-
minstrators, not students", etc
etc etc. Also. if you feel a need to
relate to your own department
feel free to bear signs reading
“Don‘t kill SUNYA nursing". or
“ Health care for the people" etc.
These are only suggestions and
not very original. Be creative.

‘Remember that this is a
peaceful demonstration and
nobody we know wants a repeat
of the incidents in New Jersey
where their student demonstra-
tion turned into violence and led
to several arrests. Keep cool. do

what you feel you have to, but
don’t stop anyone else either.
Violence is definitely not cool.
The police have been cooperative
and will be at the demonstration.
so there's no reason to do
anything illegal.

‘No dope or other contra-
band.

‘There will be student
marshals within the crowd at all
times. They are people who are
trained to help facilitate a good,
orderly demonstration. They are
not cops. If you have anytrouble
or confusion ask your local
marshal. S/he will be wearing a
blue armband.

*If you haveto piss. trytodoi‘
before you leave campus. There
are very limited toilet facilities
downtown. Four portable toilets
have been rented for the occa-
sion. but they probably won't be
adequate for thousands of peo—
ple. Also. there are a limited
number of restaurants down-
towu. so it would be a good idea
to eat something beforeleaving.

*If you are a student with a car
and happen to pass other
students coming to or leavingthe
demonstration. you might want
to pick them up.

*1n the event that you need
first aid of any sort. look for peo—
ple front S-qtiad and other
medical personnel who will be
there. All marshals will know
how to get first aid easily and
quickly.

"Don‘t stray off the route for
the march. We only have a per~
mit to march down Washington
Ave. from | 1:30 am til 2:00 pm.
Any deviations may upset the
police.

*Nobody “in charge“ of the
rally and march intends to in any
way limit the freedom of speech
of any other political groups
which ahppen to show up with
their literature and rhetoric.
H owever. we remind you all that
while anyone may endorse the
demonstration. only the follow-
ing groups are its official spon-
sors: SASU. CSEA. C(‘SA.
lll'l’, CUNY. Students Senate.
NYSUI’. and the I’SC.

‘Shout your brains out!! lie
enthusiastic and friendly to your
fellow students. Join in the
chants and ha\e ftin.
Demonstrations are called for
serious things. but you can have
a hell of a good time if you do it
right.

by Susan Miller
and (LS. Sontlno

The President's Task Force has
met with heavy criticism following
the release on February 24 of their
recommendations for extensive
program cutbacks. Charges of unfair
procedure have been made by facul-
ty members. who feel the Task Force
did not have enough time to fully
consider the implications of
suggested cuts.

Opposition to the recommen-
dations has been most vocal from
such programs as nursing, art
history, and astronomy. all pegged
by the Task Force for elimination.

It was recommended that nursing
be phased out over a four-year
period because the "commitment of
needed additional resources is not
possible.“

According to Assistant Dean of
Nursing, Shirley Kane. “Faculty and
students reject the recommendation
to phase outthe School of Nursing.“

Students and faculty members
have been involved in a vigorous
campaign to save the nursing
program. They have lobbied at the
State Capitol. both individually and
in groups. Students have gone to
their representatives asking for
assistance, and attended a recent
hearing of the Higher Education
Committee‘s Budget.

cluded coverage by local media

Students Coordinate Protest 0n Cuts

by Paul Rosenthal

Student government officials here
and at SUNY schools across the
state are coordinating efforts in
preparation for mass protests
against proposed cutsinthe l976-77
SUNY budget. Plans Include a
march on the Capitol this Tuesday.

According to SASU. reductions in
the SUNY budget amount to SSI
million so far.

A three-pronged effort has been
undertaken by SA to express opposi—
tion to both the recommendations
made by President Fields' Task

Task Force

by Daniel Galnes

SUNYA President Emmett B.
Fields will make ﬁnal decisions on
program cuts by Tuesday. He has
received a review of his Task Force's
report. on which he will base his
decisions. made by the Univeruity
Senate‘s Educational Policies Coun-
cil. Fields also received the Task
Force‘s reaction to the EPC review.

The EPC reviewed the procedures
of the Task Force and 67 responses
to it from academic and ad-
ministrative units of the univer-
sity.2l of which did not take issue
with the Task Force. 25 that were
discussed but not considered ofsuf-
ficient weight to alter the Task Force
recommendations, and 2| that the
EPC felt contained relevant evidence
that may have been overlooked by
Task Force.

The Task Force delivered its reac-
tion to those 2| comments to Presi-
dent Fields yesterday. The Task
Force reiterated its recommen-

 

Force and proposed tuition and
room rent hikes.

Central Council Chairperson
David Coyne said a voter-
registrati on / letter-writing campaign
is underway in an effort to give
students a more effective voice in
governmental decision making. A
Student Association ofthe State Un-
iversity spokesperson said similar
programs are underway at other
SUNY schools.

A teach-in has been scheduled for
Monday morning in LC-23. Faculty
and student speakers willtalk about

the implications of budgetary and
program cutbacks at SUNYA.
Proposed mass efforts will be dis-
cussed in a seminar-type setting.

The largest display of the
statewide student mobilization will
come Tuesday. with a march and ral-
ly at the Capitol. The SASU staff
predicts ten thousand students,
faculty, and support staff members
will participate.

In addition to SUNY students.

clarification and explanation where
the EPC had questioned the original
report.

Reactions from some programs.
solicited independently by the ASP,
appear on page four. A summary of
the EPC review ofthe 2| recommen-
dations in question follows. along
with the Task Force‘s response. A
third report. from the Executive
Committee of the University Senate.
assured Fields that the Task Force
and theEPC operated fairly. These
reports are available in full in the
library reserve section.

Summary

Fields asked the EPC to in-
vestigate whether the Task Force ( l)
was guided by appropriate prin-
eiplcs.(2) had procedures that would
assure all available evidence was
seeii,(.‘l) was reasonable and (4) met
the requirements of the Governor's
budget inu way that leaves the in-
stitution still wholesomer formed

for the future. The EPC, essentially,
answered yes to all four questions.
though they pointed out that it
would be difficult to answer question
three in the short time they had.

In evaluating the Task Force
procedures. the EPC said “the sub-
committee assignments and
membership were selected in such a
way as to preclude any direct conflict
of interest. Given the unavoidable
assignment of individuals to review
data concerning programs related
indirectly to their own. we were
assured that the subcommittees
reviewed data and drafted infor-
mation only. and that no formal
recommendations were made by
them to the Task Force as a whole...

as the borrowing ofa line for a year.
may have passed with a simple ma-
jority. It should be further notedthut

unimous."

Employees Association. the United
University Professionals, Inc., and
the New York State United 1 eachers
will be involved in the demonstra-
tion.

A SASU spokesperson reported
leaders from student ranks, the un-
ions. and the State Legislature are
slated to speak. SUNYA students
will march downtown from the
podium, while others will leave Lin-
coln Park. passing the Executive
Mansion. for the 2 pm. rally.

Certain individuals and groups.
such as the Pun-Caribbean Associa-
tion. have expressed a reluctance to
participate. fearinga general protest
could hurt their effons.

Coyne said Student Association.
in cooperation with SASU, is
attempting to combine separate
forces into one coalition of students,
faculty, and staff. lie said. “We‘re
not saying ‘save this program,‘ we're
saying. 'save all programs.‘ "

Cutbocks Opposed

SA officials say the
demonstrations may be a final attack
on the proposed cutbacks for SUNY
and CUNY. Monday is the deadline
for President Fields to submit a
budget request to SUNY Chancellor
Ernest Boyer.

A University Senate resolution
passed Monday requests SUNYA
instructors not to“administer exams
and not to take punitive action"
against students in next week‘s rally.

Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs Phillip Sirotkin stated.
however, that classes have not been
ofﬁcially suspended. lie announced
yesterday that “classes will he held as
scheduled Monday, March l5. and
Tuesday. March to."

Receive Sharp. Criticism

 

television stations have covered

‘ In addition to this student: ob
tained 12,000 signatures on a poti- ‘ ’
tion uru'ng support of the SUNYA
nursing program. Senator Hov‘vord
C. Nolan of Albany received a copy
of the petition prior to meeting with
President Fields last week.

The Task Force recommendation
allows for all students presently
enrolled in the nursing program to
complete their degree requirements.

Faculty members have not yet
given much thought tofacingthe job
market again. says Kane. According
to her, they are “more concernediwith
activities related to preserving the
program.“ She adds however, that
“there are unlimited opportunities”
for teaching in the nursing ﬁeld and
letters come in daily indicating
vacancies in universities across the
country.

Kane believes the university will
lose an important program if nursing
is eliminated. since it is the only one
here that is health-science oriented,
she says.

The Art History department has
also been hard hit by the
recommended elimination of the
MA. and BA. programs.

Louise Drewer, Chairman of the
department, says that "the criticism
of the task force was very subjective
and sometimes inaccurate.”

The task force claims that student
enrollment in An History is declin-
ing. Drewer says that “in I971 there
were 39f students enrolled in Art
History courses and this semester
there are 394. The number of Art
History majors has been fairly
steady for the last ﬁve years at about
35 students.“

The Task Force cites “dissension
and disorganization among the
faculty and inadequate resources" as
problems facing the Art History
department.

Drewer feels that the Task Force
may be confused. She says that there
was a negative evaluation of the
M.A. program in an outside
evaluators report done in spring
1974. However. that report only had
good things to say about the B.A..
according to Drewer. She suggests
that the Task Force has unwittingly
lumped MA. and B. A. together, at-
tributing this to short time span in
which the Task Force had to work.

Drewer calls the Task Force‘s
criticism "highly subjective” and
hopes that “ Fields will take a closer
look at us.“

Facutly and students in the
department have launched a letter-
writing campaign in hopes of
preventing the cuts. One faculty
