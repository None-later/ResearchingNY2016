analyzed the distribution of

results of the studies show that a

have had good distribution in their
course work as undergraduates.“
But he added, “You ﬁnd there are
differences from one discipline to
another.”

Morris said that the academic dis-
tribution of the 188 Humanities
graduates (1975) was “probably the
most signiﬁcant ﬁnding.” Citing
ﬁgures from the study Morris
remarked, “these 188 students
averap about two courses inscience
and math and about four courses in
the social and behavioral sdences —
they seemed to berather parochial in
their selection of courses." He said,
“Conversely, the greatest breadth in
terms of course selection by dis-
cipline or area of study was found to
be the students in the natural
sciencu and mathematics." Accor-
ding to Morris they “took
signiﬁcantly more courses" that

Overall, the results of the studies
have brought abom- some reaction
from membeis of the University
Senate. “Probably the most impor-
tant reaction? said Morris. “isthe so
tion taken by the Educational
Policies Council (EPC) where they
suggested that we reconsider the
meaningof a liberal education. . .I
think the studies provided speciﬁc
evidence for the need to consider
that question'last November the
EPC recommended that distribution
requirements be reinstituted.
Morris, who claim: not to favor
distribution requirements, does
think there will be some changes in
university policy with regards to
academic requirements. “I don't
know how soon" he mentioned, “but
I think there will besome changes.”
When asked if he thought his
studies would be responsible for
those policy changes, Morris replied,
“Only to theextent that the studies
provide evidence of past behavior of
students in course selection when

 

quirements'? ‘

given free choice. . . I wouldn‘t at-
tribute any future changes diretly to
the studies.”

Although Morris doesn't favor
distribution requirements per se, he
does favor a change in policy. Accor-
ding to Morris, students generally
should seek more course breadth.
“Part of the answer“ said Morris, “is
a limitation on the number of credits
a student can take in their own
department. . . that‘s where I
think I would start.” Morris also
feels that students should be re-
quiredtotakeaminimum number of
credits in other academic divisions.

Morris plans to continue his

studies of course distribution by in- 4

eluding 1976 and 1977 SUNYA
graduate. In this time of budgetary
crisis, Morris assertst hat the study is
“not that expensive." Although he
hasn't ﬁgured the exact cost. Morris
estimates that initially, in 1974, the
study cost about $1900. However.
after the basic development he said
the whole project annually costs on
the order of 5600-700.

Although the Rathskeller Pub has
drawn large crowds since it opened
last October, FSA Director E.
Norbert Zahm says it is currently
operating at a loss.

The bar was built during the
summer of 1975 in response to stu-
dent effort of the FSA Board of
Directors. The intent of the facilityis
to serve the students of the university
community. In order to enter the
pub, you must haveauniversity l.D.

Live entertainment, movies, and
specials on food and drink are
provided by the pub. For example,
on February 14, 1976, an eight-foot
long Valentine‘s Day cake was given
away, and special Valentine's Day
drinks were available.

Says Manager Les Hynes, “When
we do these things. very often we will
lose money on evenings like this—
but it is a service to the student."

Movies are available on a weekly
basis. On Thursday, Friday. and
Saturday nights, there is live enter-
tainment and movies are shown
betWecn entertainment breaks.

According to Hynes, all his enter-
tainment resources are culled from
SUNYA‘s students.

Changes have occurred since the
pub‘s inception, and more are being
planned.

Maplewood tables replaced the
pub‘s plastic cafe tables.

A tape deck will be installed—now
there is only aj ukcbox. Atalent con-
test will be instituted with prizes
given to the best performer of the
week.

When the pub ﬁrst opened, mixed
drinks Were 75c with one ounce ofli-

quor.1‘hen. priceswereraisedtoﬂle
for Ila-1% ounces of alcohol. Now
the price has bcenreducedto 75efor
a drink containing IVs-1% ounces of
alcohol. Happy Hour will returh.
Says Assistant Manager Paul Ar-
nold, “We want to give them
[students] someplace to go on cam-
pus where the possibility of driving
while intoxicated, gettinginto ﬁghts.
etc. is eliminated." He said, “We're
here to serve these students. We
wanted to do something for the
students because nothing was going
on in this building. We are quite
proud of the rattlkeller and want to

emphasised thnths  for 
Rattakellsr half was a 
one based on the projsa bdag 2
ﬁnished. Zahm explained thu the
ﬁgures for direct operating "W
for the ﬁscal year are somewhat on
of line, became the pub's sales have
doubled. He said as business
doubles, new bartenders must be
hired and this was not in their
original budget. ‘

Zahm says that an approximate
projection for pub sales was $63. .
which has already been reached this
year. The budget was set up in
Febrqu 1974, with ﬁnal approval
in May. A new FSA Board of Direc-
tors was sppointed in September
1974. The new board had ideas for
improvements for the ‘pub. Accor-
ding to Zahm, they are talking about
a complete renovation package,
which will cost more money.

Wall's Future In Question

Originally. an allocation between
55.000 and $7,000 was set aside for
putting in the bar itself. The
possibility of buying furniture and
making additional renovations was
considered, but no money was set
aside for this last year. Last year, a
wall costing $45,000 was brought up
for consideration, but the students
on the FSA Board this year don't
want a wall built.

On a $65,000 investment, the pub
procured a net return (income) of

15%, which is $9,900 inactual net in-
come. Zahm points out that sales
have doubled and the same net in-
come is being produced.
