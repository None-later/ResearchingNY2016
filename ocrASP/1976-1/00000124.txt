by Stephen Fieenntan

Taxi Driver, directed by Martin
Scorsese, is a troubling ﬁlm. It is at

once a powerful evocation of the
decay of N.Y.C., an insight into the
psychopathic personality. and an ex-
ploitation of the new “cult of
violence.“ Each of these elements
combine to form a frightening visual
experience.

Travis, an ex-marine, livesin a run
down apartment in N.Y.C. He has
trouble sleeping; he therefore takes a
job as a taxi driver. He agrees to
work any part ofthc city. so long as
he can work long hours. We follow
tltc movements of his cub ttsit cruises
the streets of New York picking up
rich and poor. hookers and johns.
pimps and pushcrs. it is a nightimc
N.Y. that fills our senses. It is a New
York that is decayed and decaying.
where an open hydrant that sprays
the cab is welcomed. lt rcfrcshcs the
audience just as it rcfrcshcs the
children of Bcdford Stuyvesant. All
the colors and sounds of the city
begin to merge as our insights into
'I'ruvis‘ mind build.

Robert DeNiro as Travis. gives an
outstanding performance. His por-
trayal of the crisis in Travis‘ life,
when Travis feels that he must “do
something" (“I got bad thoughts
runnin' around up here," he tells a
fellow cabbic) is remarkable. He
becomes a man possessed by hatred
of the filth he sees around him. The
human vipers that inhabit the city
are his target. Yet his wrath is blind.
he dirccts it first at a candidate for

President. Thwarted in his nssasina-
tion attempt. he murders the pimp of
n [2 your old whore and some un-

‘Taxi Driver-i:

derworld ﬁgures. Yet his rage and

sickness are not understood. This:

man whose arsenal of weapons could
arm a militia, whose wrath carried
him blindly into murder. is lauded as
hero. The ﬁlm ends. and the
audience can breathe again. Scorsese
has recognized that there are no easy
explanations for the behavior of men
like Travis. He does not bombard us
with close-ups or wild soliloquys. He
presents the character in a bold and
assertch manner without resort to
cliche or contrivancc.

Yet Scorsese‘s viewpoint lacks a
single direction. How does this
man‘s behavior reflect upon society
at large? There have always been
dcvinnts. but whereisthc connection
between this man and his city.
between American society in the
1970‘s and the tlcctly of New York?
indeed is this a valid reflection of
New York. oris it too sick,ioo dttrk'l

Perhaps the most eloquent state-
mcnt about the American mentality
comes in the end oflhcfilm whcnthe
violence that had been brooding
erupts onto the screen; the ketchup
runs freely. Here is an exploitation
of the American penchant for guns
and violence. thn Travis pulls out
his 357 Magnum, the audience gasps
in fear and excitement.

We are a nation that loves it's
weapons, it‘s toys. Scorsese has
supplied us with toys. In the ﬁlm,
violence is rewarded. In society.
violence is rewarded. Here is both
the triumph and the tragedy of
Scorsese's film. it is a document
about our buttlc scarred society: yet
it suggests no answers. when we most
need them.

Martin Scorsese‘s new ﬁlm Taxi
Driver is n naturtilist‘s delight. lstty.
"naturalist". because it depicts the
scarin and sensational side of New
York City not in a realistic way. but
in the exaggerated manner of
naturalism.

Ourtour-guidc through Scorsese's
urban metaphor is Travis Bicklc
(Robert De Niro) un insomniac cab
driver. Bicklc takes us through his
night-shift Manhattan. a bleak neon
landscape. inhabited by pimps,
hookers. nndjunkics. who he fondly
describes as: “The lowest scum."
Bicklc narrates the film with
passages from his diary and he
emerges as a warm at the city: it's
alienation, loneliness. but most im-
portant. it's hypocrisy. Junkies make
him sick. but he‘s forever popping
pills. Pimps and prostitutes are
scum. but Bicklc spends his off hours
in it cheap porno-ﬁlm house.

Finally salvation comes into his
life. He falls in love with un“Angcl“
named Besty (Cybil Shepherd). a
political campaign girl from upstate.
llicklc hopes that Besty will save him
from his own personal hell of
lonlincss its well as the physical hell
of the city. The affair comes to an
abrupt end, and he rclcnts that she
was “just like all the rest".

Frustrated. Truvis conﬁdes to the
veteran-cobble. "Wizard" (Peter
Boyle). that he‘s plagued by “bad
thoughts." Wizard responds that
"after a few years a man becomes the
job." Bicklc. howcvcr becomes the
city. lie becomes his own hell. Some
men may lead lives of quiet despera-
tion, but Bicklc, an cx-murine.
chooses a life of violent retribution.
He becomes the self-appointed
saviour of New York. He takes up a
strenuous regimen of exercise and
ﬁrearms training and while his body

Still alive at the ﬁnale, Bicklc stands
in the room with the hysterical Iris
and puts a pistol to his head. Bicklc
clicks the empty gun in desperate
frustration. Thcrc seems to be no
way out. not even suicide. Bickle
then dies and goes straight to hell.
which in Scorsese's ﬁlm means he
recovers and goes back on the street
to his cab.

The filming of Taxi Driver was
done on location and this must have
created mnny problems. Those
problems are further exaggerated by
the cinematography. which is often
as shoddy us it is pretentious.

cameras with the reﬁnement of a

strapped to all pans of the cab‘s
anatomy. and indoors. shoulder-

As for the acting in Taxi Driver,

again with her total lack of acting

child forced to be a woman, and
forcedto be a whore. Her resigna-
tion and latent dreams underline
Bicklc's desperate plight.

But the acting in the ﬁlm is
dominated by Robert De Niro. who
plays the troubled BickleHis last role
as the young Vito Coreleone. in
Gadfa/hcr Part Two. was exceeding-
ly good. considering the role had
already been deﬁned by Marlon
Brando. Dc Niro‘s Bickle is a bright
man. but one who‘s perceptions are
severely limited. De Niro plays these
limitations superbly. Hc underplays
a portrait in urban pathology that
might have been ovcrplayed by any
number of other actors. De Niro
prepared for the ﬁlm by actually
driving a cabin New York bcforethe
ﬁlming. As an actor. he has complete
control of his body on scrccn, par-
ticularly his facial gestures. He has a
gift for economy in his acting and
movement which allow him great
lcvity and free range in his character
projection.

But Dc Niro's performance. no
matter how strong, cannot redeem
the ﬁlm. The main ﬁnw perhaps lies
in the screen-play. which leaves so
many things unanswered and am-
biguous. that it seems as thoughthir-
ty minutes are edited from theﬁlm.

Scorsese has gambled and given
the public uninteresting but an ugly
and flaWed movie. Unlike his last
work Alice Doesn't Uve Here
Anymore, Taxi Driver offers little
solution. no salvation. and little
humour. Ruben De Niro, on the
other hand has managed to give us
an amazing portrayal against all the
odds. and has won recognition as a
rising artist. 1 suggest that you wait
for his next ﬁlm. Fitzgerald's The
last Tycoon. thut screen-play it be-
ing scripted by English playwright
Harold Pinter, and it should prove
very interesting. J
