never even questioned. You‘too'k the time to wonder
why sin-jury andarb'itrary borders should have the
power to divide peoples. Why peop'leo‘f different races
or coeds or political afﬁliations should have reason to
kill each ether.

The most important part of the 1960's was the
canoe}! of love and the beautifulpeaple Yoolearnedto
smile for‘t’he hell of it. and to trust a stranger. You
decided to give up the rat race business world and
sought more abstract and philosophical prosperities.
You saw yourself as essentially good. and searched out
the good in others. You wantedto love. andlove freely.

The 1970‘s are far distant from the 1960's. Best of
friends keep tabs on the nickcls and dimes they owe each
other. and it is difﬁcult to grab a cigarette Faded and
worn denim workclothcs cost as much as formal clothes
cut of the finest material. instead of the natural. we of
the 1970's have the “natural look“. And we wear
platform shoes to add to our comfort.

We don‘t have brotherhood anymore either. All we
have are triggers. P.ll.‘s (a new development to replace
“spic”), likes. and wops. And we ﬁle those school-of-
business applications and cut the humanities programs.
Don‘t gve away a paper. why should someone get
something for nothing? Sell it. We embezzle our own
student funds. At a party we often separate from the
others to smoke a private joint. Or better yet. smoke it
alone before we get there.

Love was to the 60‘: what competition is to the 70‘s.
We‘ve brought the rat race of the business world into
our personal relationships. With our apathy. cynicism.
and self-centeredness we have forgotten how to reach
out to each other. Perhaps the idealists of the 1960‘s
loved indiscriminately, we do not love at all.

The 60‘s generation was prepared to sacriﬁce all it had
in the ﬁght for world freedom. Now we are so
preoccupied with personal freedoms that we sacriﬁce

ancient Greece not many women
managed to attain prominence or
fame. One who did ivas Aspasia. a
native of the Ionian city of Miletus.

Aspaaia came to Athens some
time after 450 EC. as a young
woman perhaps 20 years old or even
younger. She opened in Athens a

for the daughters of the leading
Athenian families. It is clear that she
encouraged the intellectual and
social emergence of Greek women.
By her beauty and intelligence she at-
tracted the great Pericles, who. hav-
ing earlier divorced his wife, made
her his mistress. Aspasia remained
by the great staieman‘s side until his
death and bore him a son. also nam-
ed Pericles.

Like Anaxagoras and Phidias.
Aspasia was attacked by Periclcs‘
political opponents. She was tried in
an Athenian criminal court for im-
piety, defended by Pericles himself,
and acquitted. In one of his comedies
Aristophanes called her the madam
of a brothel and blamed on her the
outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.
On the other hand Plato. in one of
his dialogues. attributes to her
Pericles‘ famous Funeral Oration.

novelist. of course, is not bound by
the facts of history, and Miss
Caldwell puts much into this novel

Aspasia is the subject of a recent

Persian satrap, she and Pericles are

Phidias dies in an Athenian prison.

Aspasia at times sounds like a con-
temporary advocate of women's
rights. and Pericles, most un-
believably, is a severe critic of At he-
nian democracy. There are many
anachronisms and many mis-
representations of Athenian political
and legal institutions which appear
to be inadvertent and add nothingto
the novel.

Nevertheless. Miss Caldwell‘s
book, Glory and the Lightning,
brings historical characters to life
and makes excellent leisure-time
reading

by Lon levin

This piece was written to avenge the public lynching
of The Sound of Music. a movie which deserves more
respect than TV gave it. In front of millions, it was cut
up and displayed in between the golden arches of
MacDonaIds. I didn't know whether to eat or sing.
Now, I could understand advertising which was related
to the ﬁlm. Perhaps air freshener or guitar strings or
Planned Parenthood or even war bonds.

However. the time of dissected movies will soon be
over. When Home Box bey'ns to appear in every living

- room, showing full length movies without commercial

intcruption. the competition willdrivecommercial TV
to either become innovative again or cease to exist.

And now. in memoriam, here is my piece sungto the
tune of“l Am Sixteen. Going on Seventeen" as sung by
the Big Mac Family Singers:

You are slxleen, going on seventeen
Innocent and naive

Because you're so sweet

We'll sell you our meal

And maybe an apple pie

You need someone
Established and wiser
Telling you who! to do.
Forget your health
And add to our wealth
And try

Our crispy

French fries.

Totally unprepared are you

To face our ad campaign

Now with your mind we can make you
Think our shaker are like champagne.

You need someone

Established and wiser

Telling you what to do,

You are sixteen, going on seventeen
We

Are happy

To serve you.

Tune in next week.
