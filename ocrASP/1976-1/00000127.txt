them. so this s the Albany disco scene,
3 the infamous Varsity Inn. Smoky
darkness is made electric by blinding
= norm ‘or colored light throbbing to the
- frenzy‘of the Stones lead guitar. “Heart-
, breaker, heartbreaker" resounds through
the smoke and heat and I stare infascina-
tion at the  of swaying, sweating
bodies writhing beneath the ﬂashing
lights and imagine, for one minute, that to
one unacquainted with the current modes
of  recreation this would seemto
be a room full of people in unbearable,
agonizcd torment.

I feel an arm coil around me. “Hey
baby, I said do ya wanna dance?" Retur-
ning to reality my eyes shift and focus on
the body next to me who's ﬁngers are now
roaming in the area north of my waist. I
do a graceful two-step out of his range
and turn to face my would-be seducer.

My gaze is level with a heavy bronze,
cross-shaped medallion hanging on a
thick. wide-linked shain. A purple shirt
with silver diagonal stripes is open tothe
waist where a thin metallic silver belt con-
trasts against navy wide-bottomed pants
concealing two-tone shoes with silver
laces and four inch wedgies. My eyes turn
upward for the ﬁnal appraisal and ﬁnd a
face fringed by layer upon layer of thick,
dark, hair brushed back and lifted up as if
through an opening in his head.

I couldn't decide if the shadow under
his nose was due to the dimness or a
sprouting mustache. I caught a good look
when the lights suddenly ﬂashed. It was

do you know?" lfigurethatshouldthrow
him. I'm wrong. The ﬁngers are back and
roaming. He pulls me closer, the
medallion ﬂashes in my face. He grins and
I smell Marlboros on his breath and in his
clothes. G'od, he's really close.

“Hey, ya look like a really cool chick. 1
can really get into this song. Cmonl"

I don't have a chance to object. He pulls
me through the mass of bodies, weaving
in and out until we‘re standing in the
midst of them. The tape has changed, I
recognise the familiar opening line which
is greeted by cheers of approval by the
crowd who immediately resumes their
bumps and grinds. “That‘s the way. . . I
like it" mouths the kid as he bumps
skillfully against my upper thigh.

Strobe lights ﬂash white, green, red,
orange as the writhing mass groans and
grunts in soulful bliss. The rhythm is in-
toxicating. I look down and realize my
leg are matching the kid‘s moves without
any trace of inhibition. So what if he‘s a
minor, this feels terriﬁc! Saxes pulsate,
trumpets unwind. voices ooze, “That‘s the
way uh huh uh huh.” Ooooh yeah, what
ecstasy! We are all one throbbing mass of
nerves touched off by heat and sweat and
light and an amazingly barbaric rhythm
that pierces all layers of acquired
sophistication to set you free.

Pandemonium breaks loose as the sax-
es fade out and the voices last “uh huh uh
huh” grows faint. I wipe my forehead with
my sleeve and toss back the hair that is

sticking to my face. I am exhilarated as
one who has been porged from all anx-
ieties. ’l'he adrenalin has been released
and is overflowing in my veins. I stand,
impatiently anticipating another brassy
tape. My rapture is interrupted by the
strong smell of tobacco— Marlboro's.
The kid offers me one. I shake my head.
He leans back on his silver laced wedgies
as if examining me, takes a deep drag for
effect, and exhales it in quivering rings
that float weightlessly upward. I have to
smile—this kid is really something.

“You‘re not bad baby. Ya know howto
move”. He inhales again.

 

“You‘re not bad yourself, for a kid". He
ignores the latter half of my compliment,
which I expected. then leans forward and
puts both arms tightly around me, which I
did not expect. .

“it's a slow one”. he whispers. I am
suddenly aware of a low, deep moaning.
It‘s Barry White now, sighingamidst bass
and violins“l'm gonna love you, love you,
love you". The kid gets comfortable, folds
himself around me. What the hell.
White‘s sensual tenor exudes passion that
is overpowering even to the coolest chick.
so I sigh in sweet surrender and put my
arms lightly around his neck.
