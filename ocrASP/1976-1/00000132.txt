nu... inmate's. UpsetHamilton, 91-83,-
CavanauyhfSeores 36' in Season Finale

by Mike Pith-ski - _

While most of the university pop-
ualtion was enjoying its recent vaca-
tion. the ,Albany State varsity
basketball team was ﬁghting for its
life. Tsngling with powerhouses
Hartwick (ranked number one in
Division 11-111) and Hamilton
(winner of the ECAC Division 111
tournament last week) at University
Gym, the Great Danes were,
amazingly, able to salvage a split.

Defeated by Hartwick 70-68 on
February 27, the Danes rebounded
to upset a heavily-favored Hamilton
squad by a 91—83 marginthe follow-
ing Tuesday. That victory closed out
their seasonal record at 12—11 and
kept Coach Richard Sauers' streak
of neverhaving a losing season here
intact at 2| consecutive years.
Albany ﬁnished third in the SUNY
Conference which was won by
Plattsburgh.

1n the Hartwick affair, the hosts
led early but trailed for most of the
game. With the Warriors employing

“an sgyessive 1—3—1 zonewhich.
according to Sauers. was “tough for
our small guards.” the Danes were
having their problem.

“They [Hartwick] had three guys
at 6‘5“, 6‘6”. and 6‘7" as a starting
from line and we had to work hard to
get off a good shot," explained the
coach.

Surprisingly, the Danes more than
held their own off the boards—
thanks mainlyto a hard-working Vic
Cesare who snagged a game-high
total of 12 rebounds.

The Danes led 24—20 late in the
ﬁrst half, but were outscored 12—2
in the remaining minutes and trailed
32—26 at intermission. Most of the
damage was done by speedy Dana
Gahres and center Bill “Stretch”
Martin—a reported pro prospect.

The Warriors increased their lead
as the second half opened. but the
Danes kept ﬁghting back. With
Albany center Barry Cavanaugh in
foul trouble. Sauers moved Kevin
Keane to the pivot and he responded

Gymnasts Finish at 12-7;
Sixth in N. Y.S. Tourney

by Clelstlne Bellini

“We competed against top-ﬂight
schools and held our own quite
well," said Dr. Edith Cobane, the
varsity Women's gymnastics coach,
regarding the team‘s 12-win-7 loss
season record.

The Danettes completed 'their
schedule in late February, losing a
pair in a triangular meet, 72.60
points. to Canisus (10l.20 points)
and Ithaca (78.50 points) colleges
and splitting their ﬁnal meet with
7200 points to Rhode Island's 72.75
and Westﬁeld's 71.15 point totals.

The team neverceased to show im‘
provement.

“The Westﬁeld meet marks our
highest total," ‘suid Cohnne. “with

,scoring like that (72.00 points), no
oneican complain. it was a beautiful

meet with equal teams competing.”

The New York State Tournament
on March 6th was the zenith of the
season, consisting of competition
between the ten New York State
schools of Canisus, Cortland,
Brooklyn. Ithaca. Brockport,
Albany, Cornell, Hofstra, Queens
and New Paltz. (Listed in order of
ﬁnal rankings.)

Placing 6th in the ﬁnal ladder,
Albany scored it's highest total of
75.10 points to wrap up the season
with a grand ﬁnale.

Outstanding performances Were
executed by Carla Landsman, ﬁrst
among Albany's entries‘on the beam

with a ﬁne performance. “He really
asserted himself out there,” said
Sauers. '

With seven minutes left in the
game, Hartwick led 57—46 and held
an eight-point advantage at the 4:43
mark. Winston Royalthen found the
range and popped in a few quick
buckets to bring the hosts back to
life.

Albany closed to within two bu»

could not get the knotter. Their-ben
chance came with less than a mintae
remaining. Trailing 68—66, the
Danes had gained control of the ball
as Royal brought it upcourt. Near
the foul line, he tried to split the
defense, but had the ball deﬂected
away. Hartwlck's Ralph Pugliese
was then fouled and his two free
throws put the game on ice. Keane's
bucket at the buzzer was academic.

“It was the right play," Sauers said
of Royal's last-minute turnover.
"Had he kept his balance, lthink he
could have found Audi underneath.“

Royal, however, was Albany's top
point-getter with 14, while
Cavanaugh garnered 12 and Keane,
10. Gahres and Martin shared top
honors with 19 apiece.

As for the Hamilton contest, the
story, in a nutshell, was Barry

Hitting on an incredible 16 of 20 ﬁeld

the lead see-sawed quite a few times.
But the last time the Danes trailed

Boaters Host Home Invitational

by Nathan Salant

Contrary to popular belief. the
varsity soccer season did not end in
December with a 4—3 NCAA Tour-

- nament loss to Binghamton, but

continues through the winter
months via a number ofindoortour-
naments, including the Albany 1n-
vitational. scheduled for Saturday
(6:30 pm—10:30 pm) and Sunday,
March 13 and 14 (this weekend), at
the University Gym.

Albany will enter two squads
(team ﬁeld seven players as opposed
to the ll-playcr units outdoors)
agath some of the ﬁnest schools in
the country, including: Cornell,
Hartwick. and Onconta (Each of
whom participated in the NCAA
Division 1 Tournament); Adelphi

(Div. 11 NCAA Tourney); St. Fran-
cis; Keene State, and Kings Point
(ECAC Tournament); Binghamton
(Div. [11 Tournament); RH, and a
team to be named today.

Last year, Hartwick and Oneonta
were the ﬁnalists, with Hartwick
overcoming a 2—0 Oneonta lead to
win, 3—2.

“We expect to do very well in this
one," said Albany varsity soccer
coach Bill Schieffelin. "The competi-
tion will be the ﬁnest we‘ve ever had
at this school in the way of indoor or
outdoor opponents. but based on
our strong showings in other indoor
tourneys so far, we have to rate with
the best teams.“

Indeed, Schieffelin‘s commentary
is easily supported. Albany has par-

ticipated in ﬁve indoor tournaments
to date; their worst showing was a
semi-ﬁnal loss to LIU, 1—0 in the
Southampton Tournament.

The indoor season began at St.
Lawrence, where the Booters easily
won the tournament, beating Con-
ference foe Plattsburgh in the
process. Next came the Hartwick
Tournament, with Albany pitted
against such Division 1 foes us
Philadelphia Textile, Penn State,
Sourthern Conn.. East Stroudsburg.

a

Legislature Slashes SUNYA More

by Daniel Gaines ,

SUNYA President Emmett B.
Fields has accepted his Task Force's
recommendations “in their entirety,"
and has forwarded his report to
SUNY Chancellor Ernest Boyer and
the Board of Trustees. Both are ex-
pected to approve'the report.

The termination of seven doctoral
programs. ﬁve master's programs.
eight bachelor‘s programs and
various administrative functions will
cut $1,343,200 from the SUNYA
budget.

This figure matches the figure in
Governor Hugh L. Carey’s Ex-
ccutivc Budget.

Last night the legislature released
its budget, cutting on additional
$44,200 from SUNYA. $33,700 of
that was in f orcign student advise-
ment and $10,500 in public relations
activity. TAP will not be cut.

Dean of Student Affairs Neil
Brown, when contacted at home said
he suspected that the foreign advise-
ment cut includes the director ofthe
International Student Office. The
director‘s secretary. and the director
of Suylcs Hall.

He pointed out that the resident
director of Sayles Hall is not an ad-
visor its the Legislature probably
thought—it is on the some budget
line with the 180 by ﬂuke.

David Van Dyck. Director of
Community Relations said the cut in
public relations activity could affect
catalogues or brochurcs created in
his office. or possibly equipment.

The legislature‘s budget cut public
relations throughout the state
bureaucracy. Foreign student ad-
visement was cut on each campus
where a program existed for them,
and many SUNY schools had utility
funds cut because it was felt they
were not efficient enough.

Ficlds’ cuts, based on Carey's
original budget. are the same as the
'l'usk Force‘s: doctoral programs in
Classic, French, Romance
Languages. and fourinthc School of
lid ucntion (the original six were con-
solidated into two); master‘s
programs in Art History, Com-
parative literature. Italian, Latin-
Amcricrtn Studies, and Speech
Pathology and AudioloEY; and
bachelor's programs in Art History,
Astronomy, Comparitivc
Literature, Environmental Studies,
Inter-American Studies, Italian.
Nursing and Speech Pathology and
Audiology.

Some courses in these un-
dergraduate areas will be continued,
however, for non-majors.

Fields' reallocation of resources
away from the Humanities last
semester has been delayed by the
new budgetary situation. Those
rcallocations were to how added
faculty to the schools of Education.
Criminal Justice, Business, Public
Affairs, Social Welfare and the divi-
sion of Social and Behavioral
Sciences.

While Public Affairs will gain two
positions next year. Education will
lose live. and the other beneﬁciaries
will have a net change of zero.
Humanities. which was to lose nine
positions under the reallocation

plan. will now lose l2 in the ﬁrst

I year.

Fields followed recommendations
to elirniate the Ofﬁce of Un-
dergraduate Studies and the
Vocational and Veteran‘s Counsel-
ing Center. Their responsibilities will
be redistributed.

Student Affairs was cut by 12.5
positions, over a third of which will
come out of the Student Health Ser-
vice. .

Fields said in the report that the
university offers “more programs
than can be sustained with available
resources. We must now give up
some for the sake of others.“

Fields pointed out thatthecurrent
number of majors in the terminated
programs is about 750, or slightly
less than ﬁve percent ofthe campus
total.

To insure that any retrenched
faculty would have at least a year's
notice, the cuts will not be fully put

Board Of Trustees Sues Nyquist

by Paul Rosenthal

The SUNY Board of Trustees is
awaiting a response from the State
Education Department in a lawsuit
challenging the Department's right
to discontinue SUNYA‘s historyand
English doctoral programs.

An SED spokesman said a
response to the suit would be
forthcoming by the end of the
month. He said Education Com-
missioncr Ewold B. Nyquist “hasthc
right to control what courses are
rcgistercd" at SUNY institutions.

The legal action is the first one
etcr to qucstion the extent of SED
jurisdiction over the SUNY system.

SUNY Chancellor Ernest Boyer
said of the case, “State and federal
agencies can and should coordinate
planning and monitor programs.
They cttnnot and should not run the
institution."

SUNY officials say the action is
based in pan on 1961 legislation
which removed the State University
from direct control of the lionrd of
Regents.

SUNYA Vice President for
Academic Affairs Phillip Sirotkin
said that, although the SUNYA ad-
ministration is not directly involved
in the suit, it is “supportive” of the

Bonrd of Trustees‘ action. He said
Nyquist “has made the decision un—
ilatcrally,“ without consideration of
SUNY‘s ownjuriSdiction.

Boyer said SUNY fully accepts its
responsibilities tothc Regents andto
the State Legislature. but explained
that “This process had never been
challenged.“ He believes that Ny-
quist‘s decision to close down the
two doctoral programs had confused
the relationships in New York’s
higher education governance.

SED officials say Nyquist was ac-
ting completely within lhc law in his
decision. “This is one of our
rcgulntory functions over all educa-
tion in the state,“ said u spokesper-
son. He said the Department does
not oversee the day-to-day running
of SUNY, but rather the “broad
policy dccisions."

"Mission" Considered

The Board of Trustees uuthoriled
the legal action partly in response to
u report received from SUNYA
President Emmett Fields. The rcpon
said that the history and English
doctoral programs were central to
the "mission" of the University.

Boyer feels that Nyquist‘s decision
was particularly obj cctionuhle at this
time. “Now that we face constraints

Demonstration Today

Thousands of students and SUNY
employees from all over the state are
expected to rally in front of the
Capitol this afternoon to protest the
$51 million in cuts that have been
meted out to SUNY so far by the
Legislature according to student
government officials.

SUNYA students planned to meet

.in front of the Campus Center this

morning and march down
Washington Avenue to join other
protesters in the 2 p.m. rally down-
town.

Express buses from the circle will

be provided for those who do not
march. but wish to attend tht
demonstration. Student Association
says that it has allocated funds for
buses to run every ten minutes, stur-
ting ut 1 pm. and ending at 6:30 pm,
In addition to State University
students, an estimated 4000
protesters are expected to arrive
from CUNY. Buses are reportedly
being sent from SUNY schools at
Buffalo, Binghumton, Oswcgo,

perative that the University‘s
authority be maintained."

A hearing of the lawsuit may not
occur for some time, but a decision
will most probably havclong-lttsting
