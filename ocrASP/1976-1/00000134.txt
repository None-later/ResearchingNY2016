by Edward Meter

The New Orleans Mardi Gru is a
“drunken Halloween.” “A great
place to see in mid-winter. a lot of
girls with very little clothes on.” and
‘-‘a good excuse to go mental.” Thus
the capsule comments of some of the
SUNYAites who caught the wild
carnival prior to its end on March 3,
Ash Wednesday.

Mardi Gras means parades. Social
clubs called Krewes enter ﬂoats in
the vast processions, with costumed
club members sitting on them and
throwing necklaces and ‘doubloons‘
out to the watching crowds.

“People go crazyto get these little
pieces of tin." says Ed O'Neall. one
observer from Albany. SUNYA‘s
Lenny Goldman gives an example:
“I put my foot onto one of the

 

 

Fiscal Scalpel Slices SUNY

by Gavin Murphy

The ﬁscal scalpel has cut widely.
deeply. and in some cases
haphazardly into the I976 state

budget. according to a SASU
analysis of this year‘s state budget.

These cuts have mandated reduc-
tions in expenditures for almost all
state departments or agencies and
according to the I976 Executive
Budget Analysis prepared by Joel
Packer. a SASU legislative director.
“SUNY was given by farthe largest
cut” ($5l.8 million).

Governor Carey has said that the
state faces its greatest crisis since the
Great Depression, and it is apparent
that public higher education will suf-
fer as a consequence.

SUNYA faces an overall budget
reduction of Sl.369.500 and the loss
of “8 full-time teaching positions.

State University scholarships will
be reduced by $2 million and all
graduate student scholarships
eliminated.

Programs for the educationally
and economically disadvantaged
(SEEK. EOP) will be reduced by
$3.6 million.

The Governor has called for anin—
crease in tuition. which according to
the SASU analysis already “ranks
high among public universitiesin the
U.S.." being the sixth most expen—
sive in the country.

The number of students enrolling
in SUN Y schools has increased
steadily over the past decade yet the
I976-77 budget calls for enrollment
reductions.

.Despite proposed reductions in
students. the faculty-student ratio is
shown in the analysis to increase in
1976-77 to 16.6 students per instruc’
tor. The analysis also shows an 84.6
per cent increase in the average
faculty salary overthe last ten years.

At Albany the following entire
programs have been recommended
for elimination: Comparative and
World Lit. (undergraduate and
graduate). Art History (graduate).
Italian (undergraduate and
graduate), Romance Languages
(graduate). Environmental Studies.
Inter-American Studies
(undergraduate). Latin American
Studies (graduate). Nursing
(undergraduate). \

According to Packer. the
recommendations “will go to the
legislature and they can increase the
proposed budget or decrease it." or
they can jist apprqtte it as it is.

He thinks that. “in general they
won't add any more money."

Even if the legislature did ap-
propriate more money it is likely the
Governor would veto it in his deter-
mination to balancethe state budget.

the proposed budget and according

doubloons [tossed out]. A bigfat old
lady came over and started
wrenching my leg. screaming‘l want
it! I want it!‘ " Lenny does not say
whether it was the tinny picc of
prestige or his leg that the woman
wanted.

Above all. Mardi Gras means

to John Spaleck. chairman of Presi- total unrestraint. judging from the

stories of those who attended. “I met

 

this cabbie from Chicago.” says Wal-
ly Thurman “wearing nothing but a
Nehru-shirt. He said he comesevery
year." wally estimatedthe ageof this
dope-smoking. acid-eating. self-
described baseball bleacher burn as
"about ﬁfty years; he was all gray.”

On the street Lenny spotted twa
seedy looking women leaning on a
parking meter pole. In a Southern
draw], one said to the other, after
pointing to the pole, “Meredith,
that‘s just about your size, isn't it'l‘"

Some of the male revelers wore
only jockstraps. while others who
donned bras and panties would
gratefully “stop and pose for pic-
tures." said O'Neall. Albany’s
Annette Galassi observed the sex
joints weren't reticent about adver-
tising their wares: “Sometimes they

, kept the doors of a house of ill repute

open, so you could seethe girls hang-
ing out in the hallways.“

These kind of sights would often
contrast with more quaint ones.
Next to a whorehouse would be a
great Dixieland jazz band. while
next to a whore trying to make a
pick-up. would be a gray-haired Bo-

jangles tapdancing and getting

   
 
 

thrown nieltels and pennies for his
trouble.

.A lot. of the action revolved
around the balconies of buildings
overlooking the parade streets. Ac.
cording to Mike Burley, people on
the balconies would usetrinkets like
beads or necklaces as incentives to
bait those on the street into doing
certain things.

“They'd yell. ‘Take yourshirt oil!”
to a girl below. and when she did.
down camethe necklace reward. Ex-
hibitionists of a more theatrical bent
would slowly undress on the
balconies themselves, to the pleas
and hoots of the audience below.

A good deal of this fun is expen-
sive, for the Mardi Gras is a great
tourist trap. Bar prices are out-
rageous. and. says SUNYA's Tim
Smith. a half-hour stint in a massage
parlor costs $25.

Tax dollars are sometimes spent
by the U.S. intelligence community-
to satisfy the whims of foreign of-
ficials or to provide heads of state
with liquor and female companions.
the House Intelligence Committee
has charged.

Shortcomings in audit and cost
control procedures lead to the spen-
ding abuses. the committee said.

The House of Representatives In-
telligcnce Committee report on the
Central Intelligence Agency was
published this week in “The New
Citizen.“ at Schenectady weekly. with
the permission of The Village Voice.
a New York City weekly that
published the report in full last
month.

chrcscntativc Otis Pike. D-N.Y..
chairman of the committee. said
Monday the report does notjeopnr-
dizc the national security “one iota“
but did say the report will embarrass
some intelligence department of-
l‘icitils.

The committee report~as
reprinted in “The New Citizen”-—
said oncforcign official described his
son's enthusiasm for model airplanes
to the chief of a Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) station. The foreign
ofﬁcial wanted thrcc model plane
kits and even advised the CIA where
to buy them in America. A cable was
sent to thc statics by the CIA re-
questing thc purchase.

In another instance. the president
of an allied nation was preparing to

play golf on a hot afternoon. the
report said. Anticipating his thirst
after several hours in the sun. he
made a"priority“ request tothe local
CIA chief .. for six bottles of
Gatorade. One CIA employee was
immediately relieved 'of his ordinary
duties and assigned to meet the
golfer's needs.

The report said a “medium sized
station" purchased over 386.000 in
liquor and cigarettes duringthe past
five years. The purchases were
designated “operational gifts” for
friendly agents or officials “in return
for information and assistance.”

The committee was unable to
determine the reason for certain
high-cost items being purchased in
secret for many overseas stations.
The committee said hundreds of
refrigerators. televisions. cameras
and watches are purchased each year
along with a variety of home fur—
nishings.

“The question is why an American
television would he purchased here
and scnl'tt) Europe if someone was
trying to conceal his involvement
with the United States." the com-
mittee said. “Power requirements
abroad are different. and a
transformer has to be installed on an
appliance bought in the U.S. before
it will work.“

The committee report said tax-
payer monies were spent to provide
heads of state with female com-
panions and to pay people with
questionable reputations to make
pornographic movies for blackmail.
Other funds may have been used to
buy limosincs for foreign

dignatarics.

Spending abuses occurred. the
committee said. because there was
an absence of involvement by out-
siders in intelligence spending which.

 
  
 

now totalsat leastSlO billion.three - '

to four times more than Congress
has been told. Congressional and
“will” scrutiny of intelligence
budgets “range somewhere between
cursory and nonexistent."

“Executive officials do not stress
the lack of a centralized budget
authority in the intelligence services.
which causes enormous waste.
duplication and hidden costs in
military intelligence. There is little
consideration given to the extraor-
dinary spending latitude granted to
CIA. or to the CIA‘s heavy use of
‘unvouchcrcd' funds. There is no ex-
planation from FBI of the reasons
for millions of dollars of ‘confidcn-
tial‘ purchases.

“All this adds up to morcthan $10
billion being spent by a handful of
people. with little independent
supervision. with inadequate con-
trols. even less auditing. and an
overabundance ofsecrccy." the com-
mittee said in its report.

One of the best things about the
Mardi Gras is its aftermath. “(Ash)
Wednesday is neat.“ Wally Thorman
felt. because with the streets relative-
ly clear one can browse through the
“art galleries.lcuther shops and wax
museums" of the French Quarter.

would hurt us badly.“

Spalcck believes the university
centers have suffered the most from
the cuts and says further cuts.
“would threaten the existence ofthc
four university centers."

“The quality of education is not
threatened by the present cuts.“ says
Spalcck. “Thc‘only way is to do
fewer things well.“

Spaieck also believes that. "An
overall audit was necessary
regardless of the financial aspects."

He states that it' the Allen Center

begun to be phased out last year.
SUNYA would be in a more drastic
situation than it already is.

The SASU analysis also states
that “New York‘s constitutional
system of budgeting vests most
authority and responsibility for
budgeting in the governor." and
that. “The ﬁnal product (the ex-
ecutive budget) reflects the Cover-
nor‘s personal attitudes toward state
