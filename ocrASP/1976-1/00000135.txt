Trim said ck adjunmem to
nodal He I'SUNYA was not dif-
ﬁcult. Lynn Manon. from
Mansﬁeld Colic; in Pennsylvania
said. “Coming from a small school.
tlis placeis like aoountryciub.‘ She
said. 'There is more entertainment
than we ever had'

Many complained that there was
no orgara'zed emertaintnetl the
weekend beforeclassesstarted. when
most transfers arrived on campusfor
the Spring semester. "It was very
lonely here at ﬁrst.“ said onetransfer
student. “We didn't know what to do
or where to go.“

When asked ifshethought SUNY
students maintained cliques. Linda
Mirabal. from Cazenosia College in
New York said. ‘People hang
around with the same people as a
means ofsecurity because the school
is so big. People an easily get lost
and lose their identity."

Cold Studerls

Manson said.‘lt's a pretty cold at-
mosphere among the students.“ She
said. ‘An elevator ride would be a
perfect example of the situation.“

“I think everybody's got their own
group. Whet herthey are good or bad
depends on how easily you an get
into or out ofthe group ifyou wish.“
said Debbie Smith from Siena
College in Loudonville.

Academic adjustment. for most.
was difﬁcult since many felt that the
competition at SUNYA is more in-
tense. Transfers for the Spring
semester were given a “shock-
treat merit“ orientation session where
they were warned that their
cumulatite index would decrease a
whole point in their ﬁrst semester at
SUNYA

Those in charge of the oriemation
session used the fear philosophy to
spur the new students to work hard.
This strategy succeeded only in mak—
ing the ﬁrst day ofclassesa‘D-Day“
with most transfers expectingtoﬁnd
an ogre with a whip in place of the
professor.

Those who transferred from other
State University centers: Bingham-
ton. Buffalo. or Stony Brook. said
the competition and work load was
about equal. However. most
students who transferred from
smaller state colleges and communi-
ty colleges felt that the students at

‘ SUNYA seem much more grade
conscious and more intent on
beating the other guy.

A transfer from Brockport said.
“Back in my other school everyone
just worried about themselves.
Everyone did their own studying and
no one cared what anybody else was
doing You'd never catch anyone
asking a student what his index was
for last semester. People don't care
about grades."

Cuttlroat Competition

Smith said. “Competition is good
if it stimulates addedinterest. but the
minute it gets cutthroat, it's
overstepped its bounds.”

before ﬁnally arriving to stay. it

The Irish didn’t just settle in
Albany; they came. saw. and con-
quered it.

“Conquered is no exaggeration."
said William Rowley ofthe SUNYA
English department in an “Irish
Month“ lecture at Hurmunus
Illccckcr library.

Rowlcy Silid. “After 55 ycztrs in
power. should Dun O‘Connell
[Albany‘s political chicl'tun] die or
resign. could Matyor Corning ignore
the power of the Irish com-
munity'T‘Aftcr overcoming poverty.
prejudice. and disease to get that
powor. would the Irish let him‘.’

When Governor Thomus
Dongun. an Irishman. granted its
city charter in I686. Albuny was a
pluralistic town of Dutchmen.
French Walloons. Quttkcrs. French
Protestants and Luthcrttns. Though
Rowley spoke of one lrishmttn num-
cd .IunAndricssun dc Icrsmun Vun

Dublingh. a farmerand liquor excise
tax collector. around as early as
1644. the ﬁrst inﬂow of Irish to
Albany was during the I700‘s.

By I790. 644 heads of families in
Albany were Irish: some httd been
mcrccnurics in the French und In-
diun \Vnr. some had been soldiers in
the British ttrmy. ttnd some had
fought against the British in the
American Revolution.

Rowlcy told of one incident:

“A group of Tories locked
themselves up in the Albany County
jIIII for it sit-in. They spilled gun-
powder onto thc street. threatening
to ignite it if they were moved in on.
The patriots douscdthe powder with
WllIcr. and one brave Irishman num-
cd McDolc grabbed :1 club and
stormed his way in. The Tories were
subdued. and later hanged."

After the Revolution. Yttnkccs
settled in Albany. Among them was
Erastus Corning from Connecticut

(Mayor Corning‘t great-great grand- I,
father) who became president of the

New York Central Railroad and the
Albany City Bank. The Irish settlers
were well-established in Albany
when control of the city shifted from
the Dutch to the Yankees in the
“(20‘s.

Between I820 and I855. the Irish
population in Albany grew from
2.000 to 23.000.

The building of the Erie Canal in
the l820‘s brought the first wave of
poor Irish immigrants. u wave that
become :1 flood during the potato
l‘umines in Ireland iii the l840‘s.

Somc immigrants came up from
New York City by boat. but most
cttmc down from Cunudtt and over
from New England. Some walked all
the wuy.

“Good httnds wanted." the signs
said. "temperate men. Ill $12to SI 5 ti

here. “and its many jiggers of
whiskey as allowed.“

In winter the workers drifted back
to Albany. Men who httd once been
bosses had to beg in the street or cut
at soup kitchens one was set up in

the basement of city hall.

But the Irish workers didn't lose
their spirit. though they were known
for drowning them occasionally.
