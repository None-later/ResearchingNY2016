said Gaherin. “We‘re still confronted
with the same problems at the same
dimensions.“

Marvin Miller. executive director
of the Players Association. agreed
with Gaherin. Miller indicated.
however. that the owners were
stonewalling until a specific time.
and then would break the impasse.

A management source told The
Associated Press that the owners'
deadline was Monday. probably
before nightfall. That Would open
the camps Tuesday and give teams
three weeks to get ready forthe April
8 openers.

Kuhn was asked about the Mon-
day deadline and replied: “I hope so.
. . But there is a difference of opinion
among owners on how muchtimc is
needed for preparations."

The commissioner has the power
to open the camps for the best in-
terest of baseball. The league
presidents. Chub Fecney of the
National and Lee Mael’hail of the
American. also could issue the order
if they felt enough progress was be-
ing made at the negotiating table.

The thorny problem of the reserve
clause still confronted the
negotiators. The owners want a
player tied to a club—~unless traded.
sold or releascd~~for nine years. The
Players Association is willingto set-
tle for a six-year reserve clause. The
players. under an arbitrator's deci-
sion subsequently upheld by two
federal courts. legally could become
free agents in two years under the
controversial onc-and-one option
ruling.

Kuhn. however. took the play
away from the tense negotiating
scene. Casually attired in a yellow
sport shirt and red sweater. he in-
dicated that he came to Florida to
help break the impasse.

“When i think opening the camps
will help bargaining. I will open
them," he declared. “I don’t think
that anyone takes seriously the
thought that there will be no
baseball."

Gaherin. his Management Players
Relation Committee. Miller and
nine players worked at the problem
for 7% hours Sunday. Included
among the players present were Tom
Seaver, the pitching ace ofthe New
York Mets; Pittsburgh Pirates
slugger Willie St’argell: Lou Brock
and Reggie Smith of the St, Louis
Cardinals, and catcher Bob Boone of
the Philadelphia Phillies.
