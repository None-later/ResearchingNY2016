I _“I‘ not disappointed.” said
Albany '5 i'varsity a basketball coach
Richard Sauers. “i feel we're as good

aeany Division III, team around,

right now.” .

The Great Danes had just com-
pleted a struggling 12-11 campaign.
but 'Sauers was anything from dis-
traught. “We beat three of the top
ten ranked teams in the state and
onlylosttoHartwick[numberonein
Division 11-111] by two [70-68]. 1
think we‘re a much better team this
year than last year.“

Last season. the Danes posted a
15-10 seasonal log. Why is this year
“better”?

“We‘re more disciplined. we take

better shots, and we have a better'

bench.” answered'the man who has
been around long enough to know.

Doctor Richard Sauers. who
became head coach of the basketball
team here beginning with the 1955-
56 season. has never had a losing
campaign in 21 consecutive years.
His Albany record now stands at 332
wins and only 161 losses-a .673

tainly. one Wotlld have to point to
the youth factor. Of the 12 members
of the squad. not one was a senior.
and only live werejuniors.

“This is the youngest team that
I've ever had.” said Sauers. “in the
past. I‘ve seldom had sophomores in
the lineup. But this year. in one
game. we had two sophomores and
three freshmen on the court at one
time.“

The three freshmen. Barry
Cavanaugh. Brian Barker. and
Winston Royal. all showed promise
during the season. of the three.
Cavanaugh has to be regarded asthe
standout. Not only did the 6’ 7"
center crack the starting lineup, he
led the team in scoring with a [3.5
points-per-game average—the ﬁrst
frosh to turn the trick since Gary
Holway did it in the 1955-56.
season.

But even if someone ltadpredicted
the Danes would come up with a
rookie sensation. name could ex-
pect them. before the season began,
to come up with a winning season.
Why? The schedule.

and cross-town rival Siena. just to
name a few, the cards were not in the
Danes‘ favor.

“But it wasn't o'nlythemﬁ' explain-
ed the coach. “The teams that used to
be pushovers are damn good clubs
now." For instance? “Six or seven
years ago. Union was nothing.”
(They defeated the Danes twice).

Ironically, the Danes began the
season like gangbusters. Winning
their first live contests. two by
margins of 18 points or more.
Albany threatened to tear up the
league. But a rush of injuries (Bob
Audi, Mike Suprunowicz. and
Cavanaugh. notably) cooled them
off in a hurry. Of the succeeding
seven games. the Danes managed to
win only one. and suddenly, they
were a .500 ball club.

A victory over a tough Oneonta
squad in overtime seemed to give the
Danes a big lift. but it didn't come
without a price. Star guard Gary
Trevett broke his wrist in that con-
test and now the Danes were minus
one experienced backcourt man for
the remainder of the season.

Kuhn: Camps Open Soon

by Ralph Berrnuin (AP)

Commissioner Bowie Kuhn is ex-
pected to step in today and order the
opening of baseball's springtraining
camps while negotiations continue
between club owners and Players
Association over a new labor con-
tract.

“I can't offer you a hard date.
whether it is Monday or Tuesday.
but we will have baseball and on
time." Kuhn said Sunday in a sur-

 

  

prise appearance at the hotel where
negotiations are taking place.

Despite Kuhn’s optimism. the
negotiators issued dour reports at
the end of the 29th negotiating ses-
sion.

"We're along wayfrom huvingthe
key to the padlock." said John
Gaherin. the chief negotiator for the
owners.

“There is no drastic change at all."
