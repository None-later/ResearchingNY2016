F.B.1. on Campus

During the 1960’s and early
1970’s, .1. Edgar Hoover
repeatedly urged agents of the
Federal Bureau of investigation
to exert themselves more
forcefully against campus and
other radical groups. according
to previously secret documents
released last week by the Senate
Select Committee on In-
telligence.

The committee included 653
pages of documents, some of
which had been made public
before. in a 1.000-page report on
hearings it conducted in
November and December.

The F. B. 1.'s
counterintelligence program
against the radical groups.
known'in bureau parlance as
“Cointclprov New Left.“ was es-
tablished by a memorandum
from Mr. Hoover dated May 10,
1968. Later memoranda
suggested specific approaches
thatF.B.|. agents might take to
disrupt radical groups.

In a memo dated Oct. 9. 1968.
Mr. rioovcr complained.
“Despite these instructions and
in the fact of mounting evidence
of [the radical groups'] moral
depravity. little evidence has
reached the Bureau to indicate
field offices are using this infor-
mation to best advantage.“

He ordered 1".B.L offices to
send anonymous letters to the
parents of any student who was
arrested during it demonstration
or whose “participation in a
demonstration is accompanied
by the use of or cngagerntn in an
obscene display." enclosing
photographs. if they are
available.

In ri letter he wrote to 1“. 13.1.
offices on .luly 23. 19611. Mr.
I'loovcr said. “I have been ap-
palled by the reaction of some of
our field offices to some to the
acts of violence and terrorism
which have occtirrcd. such as
those which have recently taken
place in certain college towns
and in some instances on college
campuses."

Mr. Hooicr urged the field of-
liccs' to make “every logical el—
l’ort“ to determine if radical
groups were bchiridtheviolcncc.
‘Militiincy Escalating Daily"

“1 have reminded you time and
again that the rnilitancy of the
New Left is escalating daily."
Mr. Hoover told the agents.
“Unless you rccogrii/c this and
move inn more positive manner

. . . , this type of activity can be
expected to mount in intensity
and to spread to college cam-
puses across the country. This
must not be allowed to happen
the 1 am going to hold each
Special Agent in Charge per-
sonally responsible . . . "

A July 9, 1968. memoto F. 3.1.
offices listed suggestions for dis-
rupting radical groups. in-
eluding:

“Preparation of a leaflet
designed to counteract the im-
pression that Students for a
Democratic Society(S.D.S.) and
other minority groups speak for
‘he majority of students at un-
iversities. The leaflet should con-
tain photographs of New Left
leadership at the respective un-
iversity. Naturally. the most ob—
noxious pictures should be
used."

Taking advantage of "per-
sonal conflicts or animosities ex-
isting between New Left leaders“
and of the “definite hostility” of
New Left organizations toward
such older groups as the Young
Socialist Alliance and the
Progressive Labor Party.

Creating the impression that
radical leaders are F.B.l. infor-
mrtnts.‘

“The use of articles from stu-
dent newspapers and/or the
‘iindcrground press‘ to show the
depravity of New Left leaders
and members.“ especially “ar-
ticles showing advocation of the
use of narcotics and free sex."
which could be sent to university
officials. donors. legislators. rind
parents.

Passing information on drug
use by radicals to local police.

Writing anonymous letters on
radical students and faculty
members to parents. parents‘
employers, neighbors. university
officials. governing-board
members. legislators. and
reporters.

“Consider the use of cartoons,
photographs. and anonymous
letters which will have the effect
of ridiculing the New Left.

Ridicule is one of the most po-
tcrit weapons which we can use
against it."

Previously rclcrts‘cd
documents indicate that 14,111
offices did use such tactics
against radicals on a numbcr of
campuses. including Antioch
and ()bcrlin Colleges. the Un—
i\crsity ol Culilornia tit Los
Angclcs. the universities of
Houston and Minnesota, thc

CUNY and SUNY students marching to the demonstration jacobs

University of Texas at Austin
and El Prtso. and Wayne State
University.

The material released by the
Senate committee documented
some additional incidents in
which the F. B.l. sought to dis-
rupt the New Left.

According to a memorandum
dated Aug. 1. I968, F.B]1. head-
quarters scnt copies of the 1966
and 1967 income-tax returns of a
professor at it Midwestern un-
iversity to one of its offices.

The returns indicated that the
professor had claimed very high
deductions. including con-
tributions to such groups as
S.1).S., the Strident Non—Violent
Coordinating Committee. and 11
draft counseling service. The
I". 13.1. office suggested that the
information be made available to
the Internal Revenue Service.

Cooperative Reporters Used

The documents indicate that
the I“. 11.1. made considerable use
of cooperative reporters in its ef-
forts to discredit radicals.

A Nov. 5. 1969. memorandum
proposed that the 1".B.1. dis-
tribute to the news media “a
blind memorandum revealing
evidence of the growing dis-
satisfaction of militant balcks
with the New Left.“ lt cited con—
llicts between tltc S. 1).S. find the
Black Panthers and between the

anti-war New Mobilization
Committee and the Black United
Front of Washington. l).C.

In 190‘). the 1".li.1. provided
information on the New Left to at
Jackson /)tlfl_l' News reporter
who wanted to write a pamphlet
to be distributed on college carri-
prises b) the American Legion.

In addition to detailing
attempts to disrupt the New Left.

the doctiriicrits also indicate the
extent to which the 1“.B.1. cori-
ducted more traditional in-
vestigations of radical groups.

A meeting of top 1".B.1. ex-
cciilncs on Oct, 29 1970.
proposed ti major cxpprinsion of
111.1. investigations of Students
for 11 Democratic Society and
other radical groups and of black
student organirntions.

A report on the meeting said
the 15111. estimated that S.l).S.
and its various frictions included
about 2.500 persons and that
“about 252" independent radical
groups on college campuses iri-
cluded about 4,000 persons.
While the 1". 13.1. had investigated

those groups. the report said. the
bureau executives proposed that

investigations be opened on each
of the 6,500 individuals.

Expanded Probes of Black
Groups

The report added that the
15.111 had previously iri-
vestigatcd only black student
organizations that showed
“evidence of black extremist ac-
tivities." Because of an increase
in campus violence. the F. 13.1. of—
ﬁcials proposed that all black

tldent organizations be in-
vestigated. “regardless of their
past or present involvement in
disorders." The officials cs»
timatcd that this would involve
opening 4.000 new crises.

The documents did not in-
dicate whether the increased in-
vestigation of S.l),S. was ever
carried out. btit the black-
student investigation was. A
Nov. 4. 1970, memo ordered
lilil. offices to subject black
student groups to “discreet.
preliminary inquiries“ and to
“open individual cases on of-
ficers and key activists.“

l'he documents also revealed:
flint the F. 13.1. complied
with 1965 requests from the
Johnson White House lor infor-
mation form its files on pt‘lstllls
who signed telegrams critical of
US. policy 111 Vietnam. Among
those on whom information was
provided was made was historian
Hannah Ar‘cndt. according to 11
June 4. 1965. letter from Mr.
Hoover to Marvin Watson. a
White House aide.

111311. following charges of
police brutality during the
demonstrations by studnct and
radical groups at the 1908
1)criiocratic convention. Mr.
Iloovcr scnt a memo to the
1‘,1i.1.'s Chicago office urgiri
agents to "obtain all possible
evidence that would disprove
these charges . . . “ 1

The mandatory. uniform
“College Fee" of $12.50 per
semester or $25.00 per year is a
fee flint the University must con-
tinue to charge all students on
the basis of its contract with the
State Dormitory Authority. It is
a charge that most students who
pay the semi-annual SUNY ex-
penses know nothing about and
so it is important to reveal the
facts.

Prior to 1955. the Dormitory
Authority constructed and
operated the dormitories. stu—
dent unions rind food service
operations. The Authority
collected a rental charge and ti
combined dormitory. student
tinion and food service fee. In
1955. ll Lease Agreement was
entered whereby the operations
of the dormitories. the student
unions and food service
operations were transferred to
the State University. and a lease
payment (rental payment) was
made to the Authority to |i~
