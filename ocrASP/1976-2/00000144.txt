* Central

Council:

Committees

Most business whichcomes on
the floor of Central Council is
brought before one of six stan-
ding committees. The
membership of the committees
are made up of both council and
nomeouncil members; One of
the duties of The Athletic
Finance Committee (AFC),
chaired by Ellen Deutschman, is
to approve the ﬁscal budget of
the Intercollegiate Athletics
Program. Monies are allocated
from the past season contingency
fund for SUNYA athletesto par-
ticipate in championship tour-
naments such as the NCAA
(National Collegiate Athletics
Association), ECAC ( Eastern
Collegiate Athletics Conference)
and other similar tournaments.
At the present time, AFC is dis-
cussing the budget line by line for

the 1976-77 ﬁscal year. Meetings
are held in PE 231 at the gym. All
those interested are invited to st-
tend.

The Administrative and Aux-
iliary Committee, chaired by
Anne Msrkowitz. deals with ex-
tra student‘needs. (such as check

cashing) and anything dealing

with the administration of
SUNYA(including the bursar
and the registrar). Committee
members are working in-
deprndently on various projects.
Right now things likethe Univer-'
sity fee(see article) and check-
cashing are being investigated,
and would you believe that you
can see your confidential
academic records? Look for ar-
ticles concerning these issues in
upcoming SAndboxes. The
A&AS committee meets ap-
proximately every two weeks.

Students rushing pp steps of the Capitol

 

 

from page I

expect. People crashed the fences
and Marshal lines claiming “I'm
from Brooklyn. 1 wanttospeak."
The mikes were being grabbed
seemingly by anyone. and others
were looking for a leader to fine
out what was coming down.

A column broke through the
right side and headed to the
Capitol doors. “They broke the
windows." I heard. “Go to the
LOB.“ “the side doors are open."
“get off the steps." and others
were shouted, but none rang of
authority.

There was no order. Demands
were being made of legislators in-
side the I.OB[ students were
locked in the capitol, arrest and
injury reports were coming in.

but it was obvious this wasn‘t
what we had planned.

The media was trying to sort
out what was planned by whom.
Reports from “students seeking
refuge from the inclement
weather went into capitol“ to
"outside agitators caused
violence."

Who did what and why is a
question that must be answered
to keep the integrity ofthe spon-
soring groups or to laythe blame
where it belongs. This incident
should not betaken asthe tone of
the majority of the students. at
least ah SUNYA. and hopefully
not of the SA or the
organizations of which it is a
member.

The prime remb'te broadcast
of the academic year comes this
weekend for WSUA . . . Telethon
‘76.

As of press time. plans for
radio coverage on other stations
was uncertain. but an option
always available for Albany's
commercial stations is to
simulcast with SUNYA’s cam-
pus station. Last year Telethon
was aired by WSUA for its en-
tirety and the broadcast was
picked up by Station WABY.
Special telephone lines are set up
between the two station's studios
to produce the simulcast.

WSUA‘s coverage begins
tomorrow evening at 8 pm. and
continues straight through until
the conclusion Saturday night.
The station's staff will bring the
message of Telethon ‘76 to
listeners on the quads at 640 on
the AM dial.

Directly after Telethon
coverage. WSUA will switch to
its booth atthe Nassau Coliseum
for islanders hockey action with
Nate Salant and Michael
Curwin.

That‘s Telethon '76 and New
York Islanders hockey. . . live. . .
only on your campus-minded
radio station, WSUA.
