Poor communications and a
general lack of organization were
blamed by student ofﬁcials for the
violence which disrupted a mass stu-
dent demonstration at the Capitol
Tuesday. ‘

Chaos erupted shortly after the
beginning of the rally. as radicals
took control ofthe microphone and
incited the crowd to march up the
front steps of the Capitol building.
then resorting to violence.

Out of the crowd of approximate-
ly [0.000. a group of 200 or 300
demonstrators surged through
police lines at the top of the steps.
Smashing glass doors. the group
swarmed onto the second floor ofthe
building.

Difficulties were intensiﬁed
because many of the marshals
selected from the CUNY contingent
were picked on the spot. according
to several SUNYA marshals. Green
armbands signifying marshal status
were distributed randomly to many
of the CUNY people.

While many persons at the rally
were visibly angry and apparently
agreed that violence was necessary.
most were appalled. and felt that it
would injure attempts to present

rational arguments on the cutback‘

issue.

“It was inappropriately militant."
said one SUNYA student. and “only
presented a negative picture of
ourselves. while diverting people
from the important stuff [reinstitu-
tion of cutbacks].“ Student leaders

violence. and SASU organizer and
intern Judy Doesschat said the
CUNY people were “very dis~
organized."

While she admitted that there
were not enough pre-assigned
marshals,. Doesschat claimed that
the CUNY group didn‘t live up to
their obligations"—“they wanted
numbers . . . we wanted a good
demonstration.“

SUNYA Central Council
Chairperson David Coyne at-
tributed the outbreak of violence in

_thc crowd estimated near |0.000. on

a few people who “wantedradicalism
just to be radical." and a larger group
of "well intentioned students with
legitimate concerns who were ex-
tremely frustrated. and saw no other
options."

l’oor Conditions

About l.000 SUNYA students
braved the poor weather conditions.
Some marched the five miles from
the uptown campus to the Capitol.
while others joined them at Alumni
Quad. However their effort was
overshadowed by the later
developments. Planned to last for
several hours and ‘with at least a
dozen speakers scheduled, the rally
was halted two hours after its begin-
ning. while some buses Were still
arriving.

At a noon meeting yesterday with
Governor Carey. which SASU
leaders termed “encouraging. but
unproductive.“ the Governor refus-
ed to make any commitments due to
the state's current economic situa-
tion.

students. for conspiring in the alleg-
ed distribution of marijuana.

area between l972 and I975. accor-
ding to a spokesperson from the US
Attorney‘s Office.

An article in Tuesday‘s Times-
Union stated that the indictment

resulted from an investigation con-
ducted by the Federal Drug Enforce-
tncnt Administration and the New
York' State Police. Three of the

't'wo City University students
arrested at Tuesday's demonstration
have been released on bail with the
aid of attorneys contacted by

Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut.

The defendants \vere released that
night after a short stay in the Albany
County Jail to await indictment on
Wednesday.

Friends of the arrested students
called several SUNYA students and
the downtown offices of SASU iii an
effort to contact a lawyer. SASU in—
formation and Research Director
Todd Rubinstein said an agreement
had been made withthe City Univer-
sity Student Senate to arrange for
counsel.

Paul Kietstnan. an attorney prac-
ticing with Roscnblum and
Leventhal. the SA-retained lawyers.
was called. Kietsman said he made
his services available to the CUNY
students and he did go to Police
Court Wednesday. only to find that
the defendants were already
represented.

According to Steingut Press
Secretary Bill Alexander. the
assemblyman ltad been apprmchcd
Tuesday by other New York Citv
legislators trying to find counsel for
Ewing and Hoke. Steingut reported-
ly contacted Stanley Reiben. an at~
torney on the staff of the Speaker‘s
chief counsel. It was Reibennmand
his .Albany colleague, Paul

Whitaker. who arranged the
students‘ release l'rorn jail Tuesday
night.

Questions have been raised by
many individuals close to the case as
to why Steingut decided to become
involved. A spokesperson for his
Capitol office said liwing and Hoke
“seemed to bcthe innocent victims of
the situation."

Kietstnan said. “No one seems to
have arty idea [why Steingut showed
interest]. least of all the defendants
themselves.“

Ewing. a City Collegestudent. was
indicted for criminal mischief. Hoke.
a father ofsix and a graduate student
at Hunter College. was brought up
on charges of criminal mischief.
harassment. and unlawful assembly.
llnil was set at $1000 and $2500
respectively. Both defendants have
been released in the custody of their
attorneys.

Whitaker says the students“ case
has much merit. “We feel that the
demonstration was arranged for
good purposes." he said. Whitaker
called it improper tojail onlytwo out
of many disruptive protesters.

“Optimistically. one would hope
the charges might be dropped." he
said.

The students now await trial. but
aecordingto their attorney. the case
may not go that for.
