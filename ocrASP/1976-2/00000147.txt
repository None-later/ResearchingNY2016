and View Carter as a “liberal-
moderate." They speak of . his
promoting national health insurance
and federalizing welfare. as ex-
amples of his liberal viewpoint. But.
they admit his stand against forced
busing might sway many conser-
vatives to his side. “He doesn't take
labels. he refuses to be classiﬁed."
says Segal. “He tends to strike peo-

him to be,” explains Dinsmorc.
One criticism often raised against
Jimmy Caner is that although he has
promised not to lie, he has often ex-
aggerated his past accomplishments.
When questioned about this accusa-

“it is ironicthat someone whoclaims
not to lie. has had these charges
made against him. But he‘s no more
of a liar than anyone else. You have
to take whatever a politician says
with a grain of salt."

in his speeches, Caner speaks of
creating a government “as decent, as
honest. as compassionate. and as
ﬁlled with love as our people are.”
That is u formidabletaskforany one
man to undertake. but the students
of the Carter Campaign Committee
are conﬁdent that he can do it. “He

Nuclear Enema“ spend a

   

Fortune to save a Fortune?

by Brian Sana

As our Federal government makes
ever deepening commitments to
nuclear ﬁssion as a long term
national energy policy, the con-
troversy over the safety. economic
viability. and the very necessity of
nuclear power grows. There are an
increasing number of scientists.
engineers. legislators. and ordinary
citizens who see nuclear reactors as
an expensive, dangerous, and even
racially suicidal folly.

One can get both sides of the
nuclear issue simply by watching
television. The pro side is found on
powor compuny commercials, while
the con can be seen by watchingthe
news. Understanding the issue is
considerably harder, and coming to
it black and white decision is nearly
impossible. Unfortunately. no deci-
sion is a decision to proceed. so we
must do the best we can withthe in-
formation we have.

Former President Nixon once said
that unless you had a Ph.D. in
physics. it was impossiblcto unders-
tand nuclear energy and therefore it
wouldn‘t do any good to ask
questions. Beliefs like that have kept
the issue of nuclear powor from the
public untiljust recently. Perhaps it
look Watergate to shock people out
of the complacency with which they
were accepting government
decisions. Recently some very
pointed questions have been directed
tit both the government and the

powur companies.

The ﬁrst step to grasp of the
nuclear issue is ll knowledge of how a
reactor works. Uranium—235, when
bombarded with a neutron. splits

making the reaction self continuing.
This spilling releases a great deal of
heat. and it is this heat that is used to
generate steam.

The U-235 fuel is usually sealed
into rods which are inserted into the
reactor core. Also in the core are
rods of cadmium which absorb
radiation and can be used toslowthe
reaction down. The cadmuim (con-
trol) rods us well as the fuel rods can
be inserted into the core at different
depths in order to achieve a stable
reaction.

Some material, often liquid
sodium. is circulated through the
core and is used to boil water in a
heat exchanger. The steam drives a
turbine. is recondensed.’and then
goes back to the exchanger. This
system of heat transfer from thecorc
is vital to the operation of the reactor
and without it, the entire core could
melt, with disastrous consequences.
Therefore, all reactors are equipped
with an emergency core cooling
system to be used if the primary
system fails.

Our consideration of the nuclear
option will he treated in three
separate categories: economics, safe-
ty. and alternatives. The economics
of nuclear reactors are of particular
concern because it is one ofthe driv-
ing points in the nuclear industry's
advertising campaigns. it has long
been the Clillm of that industry that

nuclear power is and will continue to
be a far cheaper source of energy
than fossil fuels. This is clearly not
the case.

very favorably to oil. but not as
favorably to coal. which could serve
as a short term primary energy
source.

Another factor is that an integral
part of the road from. mining
Uranium to making electricity is
processing. At this time. processing
is being done at a loss by the federal
government. Private industry will
soon take over processing. and this
added cost will then be placed direct-
ly on the energy bill. rather than be—
ing paid discretely by taxes.

There are also disparities in the
cost for operating and maintenance
between a fossil fuel plant and a
nuclear plant. Because ofits intense
radioactivity. tltc most ti workman
can spend around the core is sixty
seconds every three months. This
makes rcpuirs cumbersomc,lcngthy.
and very expensive. One Connec-
ticul plant took ten months and ten
million dollars to repair. and a
Massachusetts plant look six
months and six million dollars.

Expensive to Build
Nuclcttr plants are almost twice as
expensive to build as coal or oil
plants. The diffci'cilce is reﬂected in
— tltcﬁxcd unnutil costs which is the in-
terest on tnoncy bdrrowed to build
the plilnl. The ﬁgure can be quite
large. and combined with poorer cf-
ficicncy on the part ofthc reactors, it
is the biggest stumbling block lothc

industry.

capacity — the amount of elec-
tricity that would be produced if the

plant. run full level all year] Nuclear

plants so far. have averaged only 60

per cent. They were expected to run

at 80 per cent. but repair problems

resulted in a drop.

Devastating Difference
Si rice the unnuaiﬁxed costs are in-
dependent of the electricity produc-
cd. and the revenue earned. the 20
per cent difference between
predicted and actual output if finan-
cially devastating. Powor companies
must make up this difference
between expected and actual
production by using other facilities
at signiﬁcantly higher costs.
Once the plant is finally built. it

can only operate for 40 years before
it gcts too radioactive to use and

 

must be decommissioned. There is
little or no evidence on the cost of
decommissioning. but one industry
spokesman was quoted in a I973
issue of Nut/conic: Week as saying
that the cost of decommissioning
could easily match the cost of
building it in the ﬁrst place.

Another hiddcncost isthe amount
needed to maintain the deadly
radioactive wastes for possibly
thousands of years. Assuming that
such wastes can be kept safelyfor the
necessary time. it could get to be very
expensive.

Far from being overwhelmingly
cheaper than fossil fuel plants.
nuclear reactors are. inthc short run,
more expensive than fossil fuels. In
the long run. they may be staggering-
ly more expensive.
