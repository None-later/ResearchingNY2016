The Blimp is back. r
The West German Government
recently approved the expenditure of
$8 million for construction of a

football-field-sized hot air.balloon
that will cruise at 90 miles per hour at

an altitude of 10,000 feet.

The helium-filled airships will
reportedly carry more than 30 tons
of cargo at one-third the cost in-
curred by a Boeing 747.

Westdeutsche Luftwerbung. the
Rhine Valley company which is
makingthe giant blimps, says it is be-
ing deluged with orders from ﬁrms
such as the French Petroleum Com»
pany, which plan to use olimps to
carry oil drilling rigs to North
African Fields.

OZONE DEPLETION

A University of California study
indicates that the gradual depletion
of the earth‘s ozone layer—triggered
by propellants used in aerosol spray
canswis likely to be more deadly
than previously expected.

The latest study has been released
by Elizabeth Scott. a professor of
statistics at the Berkeley U.C. cam-
pus.

Doctor Scott says that the newest
calculations show that a l0 percent
reduction inthe ozone layer will like-

in the number of ‘skin cancer cases
suffered by humans around the
world. .
Earlier studies had placed the in-
crease at around 25 percent, rather
than at the 35 to 40 percent level.
Scientists says that ﬂuorocarbon
gases used as propellants in spray
cans eventually deplete the Earth's

  
 
 

 

ozone layer by breaking dowu the
clone molecules. The destruction of
this protective layer would reported-
ly not only increase the number of
skin cancer cases, but could vastly
decrease the amount of food crop
production on the Earth.

BLUE Eons -

There's gddd naive and bad news '

in the egg world: _

Agronomical Institute ‘hll
developed a new chicken eggthat has
an especially tough shell. Since this
extratough egg shell should reduce
the amount of breakage in shipping.
the cost of eggs is likely to godown.

The bad news. however. is that the
egg shell is blue instead of white.
Food scientists claim most con-
sumers simply won‘t buy blue eggs.
As a result. the new egg is being
marketed almost solely for
restaurants.

ANTI-BABY SHOT

Medical researchers in New Delhi
are testing a birth control vaccina-
tion that may be effectivein preven-
ting conception for at least one year.

Doctor 0. P. Talwar of the All In-
dia institute of Medical Sciences
says that the new vaccine is being
tested for safety on small groups of
women in at least six countries.

If the method is successful. Doctor
Talwar states, it would mean that
women could prevent pregnancies
by being vaccinated just once every
l2 months.

'four men. ages 20 to 43. for the
effects of Earth Shoes on their gait
and posture. None of the men or
women had a history of foot
problems or wore cbrrective shoes.

Mann reports that Earth Shoe
wearers showed no measurable
changes in their ankle. hip or pelvic
movements. as compared to those
wearing tennis shoes or just noshoes
at all.

The American orthopedic foot
society in New Orleans last year
reported that—despite numerous
fads—the American public hasn't
had ashoe to fit the foot correctlyfor
more than 100 years.

GRIP AND ZIP

For whatever it's worth. scientific
researchch have found why people
get sweaty palms when they are
scared or nervous.

A Harvard research team reports
the moisture that appears on the

‘ahendsland the soles of the feet during

moments of fear or unrest enables is
scared person to run away faster.

The research team says that it
tested humans and other animals on
treadmills to see how efficiently they
could run with moist, sweaty feet as
compared to dry feet. They found
the extra moisture produced by ner-
vous tension gave bare-footed peo-
ple better traction, enabling them to
run away or climb ropes with their
hands at a faster clip.

HAZARDOUS HAIR

A New York doctor is warning
that long hair can be extremely
hazardous to your neck and spine.

Doctor Catherine Carlson. an os-
teopathic physician. says that long-
haired men and women who con-
stantly hold their heads to one side
or the other to peer around their
drooping locks can suffer from un<
natural spinal curves.

Even worse, she says, is the habit
of many long-haired persons who
throw their heads back to toss their
hair over the shoulders: this. Doctor
Carlson warns. can produce serious
whip-lash injuries.

FROSTY MORTIES

The State of Wisconsin is usingan
unusual method for monitoring
weather conditions and possible
frost conditions.

The Wisconsin Statistical Repor-
ting Servicc. part of the state‘s
Agricultural Department, has for is
years been collecting data about
snow and frost from—of all
people—grave diggers.

Information about snow cover
and frost is used by planters in cf-
forts to avoid unexpectedly bad
weather that could kill crops.

So the Agriculture Service
Collects biweekly reports by mail
from about 200 funeral directors.
cometary caretakers, and grave
diggers throughout the state of the

der.
