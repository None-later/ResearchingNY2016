More white-on-whitc

in an impulsive attempt to escape this
blanched academia. we drove out of
Albany. Looking for. . . what? A city of
prisms. even a town shaded Chiaroscuro.
But our venture was pure vanity. we only
found our world in continuum. . . more
white-on-whitc.

Driving on Route 9. each gust of wind
sprinkled our car with ﬂakes of the drif-
ting snow. But for the ﬁrst time this
semester. the sun showed its strength and
warmed us as we went on. Large white
mansions. set back. from the road. were
our margins and thehorilon. our only
stop sign. . . or so we thought.

“Naomi. look for Troy-Shaker Road.
We have to make a right there.“

I half-studied the street signs. morcin-
tcrcstcd in the passing scenery than in
rcnching uny dcstination. On and on. we
drove through quaint towns marked only
by rising shopping malls and first food
stands. . I closed my cycs. contcnt to fall
asleep to the steady motion of the car.

“Nit. Naomi. something‘s wrong. The
oil light is ﬂashing red. But i know i don't
nccd oil; ljust had the car checked.“

i look at Sondra. annoyed that any
mcchunicul breakdown would try to dis-
turb my slccp or foil our plunstocscapc.

“It‘s probably nothing.“ I unswcrcd.
“ Mtryhc thcrc‘s at short in thc light.“

“Wcll. l bcttcr pull into at gas station
and have it lookcd nt anyway.“ Sondra
said.

Wc trnvcllcd furl hcr. passing Coloncl
Snndcr‘s. McDonald's. Dunkin‘ Donuts.
c\cry ruud—sidc cstnblishmcnt that n
drivcr could usc as a rest stop. But no gas
sittllttlt was in sight.

“Nit. what am 1 going to do . , .
sorncthing‘s wrong with thc cur . . .
should I turn around?“

“Sondra. wc hnvcn‘t pusscd a gas stu-
tinn in the past half hour. (in it little
furl hcr."

Wc drovc nnothcr fcw milcs and a small
station nppcarcd in the distance.

n‘l'hcrc‘s onc.“ Wc shoutcd to cuch
o1 hcr. lt sccmcd too good to be true. a
mirztgc that would only disappear ut the
motncnt wc rcnchcdit. liutthc scrvicc stu-
tion was ncithcr an illusion nor a
linllucination. and as we pulled up to a
pump. an authentic women in oily
covcrulls came over to our car.

“Fill up?“ she asked.

“No. the all light kccps ﬂushing." Son-
dra said. “Could you just chuck the oil?“

The woman raised the hood and per-
formed hcr undercover work while we im-
patiently wnitcd for the verdict.

“Nothing wrong here. You have plenty

)f oil. Muyhc tlicrc‘snshort lnthclight."

 

(
L Sondra wasn't assured. “Are you

uuww»...~u..m w...

positive that the car‘s 0.K.?"

“Nooo.” the woman hesitated. “This
isn't a garage. just a filling station and i
can‘t tell you anything for sure. But
there‘s a garage a few blocks back and
someone there could check out your car.“

“Thanks a lot." Sondra replied. She
may have meant it sincerely but I was
more annoyed at the delay than ap-
preciative of the advice.

At my urging. Sondra made a daring.
illegal U-turn and we reversed ourtracks.
We spotted the garage that had gone un-
noticed before and pulled into it. Sondra
repeated her story to a stocky. oil-
slickered man.

“Can‘t check it now. . . I'm too busy
. . . Come back Monday.“

“But can‘t you even check the oil? It
would only take a minute." From Son-
dru‘s tone and look of anxiety. the man
must have known she was worried but he
appeared unaffected.

“Come back Monday. That's all I can
say."

Quickly. Sondra drove towards
Albany. wanting nothing more than to
reach a local garage. She stepped on the
gas and thc motor bummed as the car

accelerated. “Nothing‘s wrong.“ I
muttered. “She's just paranoid and she‘s
spoiling our day."

“Tick-tick. tick-tick."

“What's that?“ we asked each other. it
sounded like a time bomb. a heart
pulsating under the hood ofthc car. My
annoyance sharpened into panic and my
absurd thoughts ﬂashed. like headlines.
across the windshield. “What if we‘re
stranded. marooncd on Route 9?" I said
aloud. We looked at each other and
laughed at my foolishness.

The tick-tick intensiﬁed. drowning out
the motor‘s rustle. Graceful mansions and
farms that had seemed so friendly and
photogenic before. now were hostile and
isolated obstacles we were f orccd to pass
before reaching home. i wished we had
never ventured out of our Albany icc
palace where we could have blown up in
familiar surroundings.

“Tic k - t i c k. tick-tick. tick-tick
. . .ZROOM!“ Smoke and ﬂames crept
out of the hood and 1 studied them with
fascination whilc Sondra pulled to the
side of the road.

“Naomi. get out ofthc car! it‘s on ﬁre!"

i moved slowly. totally unaware that l

 

 

 

was in danger. But the near-zero“

temperature and the ﬂying snow were,

powerful stimulants that aroused mc .
quickly. Now. I don‘t know what had A

scared me more—the whipping ﬂames or
my contentmcnt in sitting in their range.

We looked around us and walked up I

the long path to one white-brick estate
which seemed unapproachable. lrangthc-
bell and a man opened the heavy. creak-
ing door.

“Excuse me. but can we use your
phone? Our car broke down at the side of
the road and . .  _

“Sorry. I'm usingthe phone now. Goto
the house next door." With his backturn-
ed. he slammed the door in our raw.
frozen faces. -

Numbly. we trudged to the next house
where a shingle. saying “Friendship
House.“ ﬂopped in the wind. Sondra
knocked this time and a young woman
answered the door while a child pecrcd at
us from the hallway.

"Hell. can we use your phone? Our car
broke down and we have to call someone
to tow us.“ Desperation and the biting
cold had distorted Sandra‘s voice. mak-
ing it high and raspy.

“Well. I don't know.“ the woman
replied. “Lust week the same thing
happcncd to our neighbors wholivc afew
doors down and they were ripped off."

“Plcasc.” i said. “You can scc the car
parkcd'by the road. Wcjust need to use a
phone.“

Cautiously. the woman let us cntcr her
hallway and handed us an Albany
phoncbook. While Sondra dialed. I stood
by the door~too cold. too afraid of
emerging as a would-be thicfto enjoy the
warmth of the house.

The little girl. in neat braids and party
jumpsuit. came over to me.

“Today‘s my birthday and I'm havinga
birthday party.“

“Happy birthday.“ was all my fro/cn
mouth could urticulntc. But I wishcd it
wcrc my birthday too athcn it would be
July. “it has to be wurmcr by July." I
rcmcmbcr thinking.

Sondra hung up thc receiver and thc
woman quickly ushcrcd us to thc door.

“If you get too cold waiting. you can
comc back in.“

We quickly walked away from
Fricndship Housc.

'l'hc towers cztmc quickly and lifted the
car With cure. as if it were a patient being
cuscd into an umbnlnncc. 'l'hc opcrntion
successful. we pilcd into the truck and
drovc back to the familiar. dirt-scurried
snow of Albany strccts. .Wc were not
depressed by our chcckmatcd escape;
though Sondra and I had been glad to
break away. We wcrc thrilled to return
home.

'l‘hc garage was warm and we busde in
thc bent of car radiators. But when one
uttcndunt offcrcd to drive us to our npurt-
merit. Sondra and I accepted without
hcsitntion. Once more. we trcudcd into
the snow to enter another vehicle. Sondra
sank into the passenger seat of an M0
and I sat on her ltlp. crammed between
her knees undthc roofofthc car. With my
head nestled against the frosty
windshield. l gazed with rcncivcd interest
at the soiled snow lining each familiar
road: it greeted us like print linens.
hallmarks of home.
