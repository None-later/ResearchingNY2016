by Frank Doris

Remember when everybody and
his brother used to play the electric
guitar?

Sure. you remember how it was—-
back in Junior High School around
I967. right at the peak of the Sixties
youth/ hippie explosion. It was a
time of long hair and no bras. love
beads, black light posters. psy-
chedelic record album covers. open
sex, and proliﬁc drug use. A loose,
carefree optimism permeated the
lifestyle of all of us teenagers back
,then. We all feltthat we could collec-
tively accomplish anything we wish-
ed to do—there was no hassle that
couldn't be worked out somehow.
Above all else. we lived for the mo-
ment. not caring or even thinking
about the future—after all. what l3
year old kid is going to give a damn
about the future?

And of course. the music was
everywhere. It was the primary
means of expression of our youth
culture consciousness. The bands
and the musicians were the

emembern I ‘ K
' . Rock’n Roll

spokesmen for an entire generation
dissatisfied with the Establishment
and longing for achangefrom its im-
moral, distusteful values. And what
bands they were! The Beatles, the
Dead, the Airplane. Hendrix. the
Doors. Dylan, the Stones. and a
score of others which not only
reﬂected but also shaped the lifestyle
of the whole under-30 generation.
Their music was an organic, vital.
energizing force. it was an inspira-
tion to all who heard it.

And in those days, just about
everybody and his brother were in
rock and roll bands. Fledgeling ar-
tists, rebellious high school punks.
angry. confused adolescents needing
an outlet for their frustrations—
these werejust a few of the different
kinds of kids who were irresistibly at-
tracted to the high-energy allure of
rock and roll. This was a time of in-
experienced groups walking off the

streets and into the recordingstudio.’

even less professionalism. indeed.
most recording groups around at the

 
  

 
 
   
     
      
  
   

   
 
 
 
  

time were musically deﬁcient—but
this wasn‘t really all thatbad. sincea
good deal of the essence of rock and
roll consisted of a raw. primitive
urgency which couldn't be captured
by mere technical proﬁciency. As a
result. a garage band had a good
chance of hitting it big at any given
time. given a little luck. ’

Musical equipment was cheap and
plentiful. In 1965. the peak year for
guitar production, over 1 million un-
its were sold in the United States
alone. There were intruments of
every price, quality. colonand con-
ﬁguration. The kids who couldn't get
their parents to buy their guitars for
them would wash cars, caddy, or
mow lawns. until they gottenough
money to buy that neat lo‘oldng‘rcd
guitar with the four pickupsfand
eight knobs in the window. of the
local music store. I  i .

if you were really hip, you‘d save
the extra Money and buy a Fender
Telecaster or an 80 Standard. Of
course. you‘d plug these into eithera
Fender Bandmaster (because it, was

wire unheard of. If you were lucky
enough to own a real microphone in-
stead of atelephone receiver hanging
from the ceiling (to which the cord
was fastened with masking‘tape).
you would merely plug it into the
biggest ampliﬁer in the band. along
with three or four other
microphones. A Japanese drum set
(or Ludwig if the drummer got a few
good report cards). a ﬁfty-dollar
electric bass, and afew assortedqu
boxes and wah-wah pedals would
complete the basic equipment.

Most of the local bands around
never managed tosecure any paying
gigs, but that didn‘t matter since
their ‘frehears‘als' often would up
turning into informal concerts. The
local neighborhood kids would hang
around and watch, getting
thoroughly plastered on beer. cheap
wine (usually Boone’s Farm or Rip-
pic). and pot. These rehearsals

vould take place in the garage
(hence the evolution of the generic
term “garage band“). or in
somebody‘s basement or playroom
while Mom and Dad were away. The
kids :would sit or hang loose by the
band as they played through their
entire‘repertoire of (maybe?) ﬁve or
ten- songs. The bands could‘never

-ﬁgure out any more than that

amount. How could they. when they
always had toshow off andtrytoim-
press allthe kids hanging around?
. if a band eventually got lucky
enotigh to play at the local Junior

High. they would simply play, their_

ﬁve or ten songs over and over again.
perhaps stretching a ﬁve-minute
song out forthalf an hourjust to kill
'time. Most bands at these dances

I were loose, out of tune. and
.hopcles'sly disorganized. But the
"dances themselves were the greatest.

-' The girls would initially stand on one
side of the gymnasium. trying to
look coy and seductive at the same
time (they were still relatively inex-
perienced at the ﬁne art of cock-
toasing). They guys would just walk
around and comb their hair in-
cessantly.

Eventually. one of the more
aggressive dudes would walk over to
the girls" side and ask one to dance.
From that point on. things really
started rolling. As long as the hand
pumped out a loud. stcudy rhythm,
and you managed to get u foxy-
looking seventh grade girl to dance
with you. you‘dbc ﬂying high all
night. and if you kept your cool. you
might even be rewarded with the ul-
timutc adolescent thrill: a heavy
make out session behind the
bleachers at the end of the night!

If you huppcncdto he umcmbcr of
the band pluyingthut night. you had
to look cool onstage, cvcn if you
couldn't play u fucking note. it was

, as possible r I

  

(half the gear Was usually
plugged in). V ' »
Most importantly. you hadji be
ready for a ﬁght at a, moment‘_
notice. because members 'ofriyal"
bands were always in the audience.
They would always hassle the band ‘,
onstage in order to make theniecrew
up. If your band could get through a
gig without any. equipment ripped
off between sets and without getting
into any fistﬁghts. you were doing
ﬁne. No pussy stuff in those days;
this was real rock and roll! ‘

As the people in the bands started "
to grow older and move into High
School. the scene began to lose
momentum. Other things were now
starting to take precedence over
playing in a mere amateur rock
band—money. cars, girls. sports.
academia. and so on. The values in-
herent in the whole Sixties youth
revolution had degenerated into an
artificial media marketing concept.
prepackaged and ready for sale like
any other mere commodity. The
peace] love ethic had become irrele-
vant in the overall scheme of things.
and people were now beginning to
think about college, work. and even
marriage.

As a result of these new
developments in people‘s lives. many
of them lost interest in rock and roll:
it just wasn‘t important to them
anymore. Most of the artistic. sen-
sitive types decided that they
couldn't handle the hassles of the
. electric. rock scene and bopght
acoustic ,guitars. paint sets. or
whatever. The greasers sold their
equipment and bought hot cars.
Some dudes got into trouble with
their parents. girl friends (you
know . . . ). orthelaw.Afew kids
burned themselves out on drugs to
such an extent thatthcy wereluckyif
they could even strap a guitar
around their necks.

Today. the lifestyle of the mid-
Sixtics is just a dim memory. The
cbulliencc and optimism of the era
has given way to the apathy, dis-
illusionment. and economic depres-
sion of the Seventies. As the times
change. so do the people and the
music chunge. and the rock and roll
of today rcﬂccts these changes. The
music now isjust a pulc shadow of
what it oncc was. predictable. un-
inspired. and sadly lacking in
originality and vitality. Has been
rock stars of yesterday arc living off
their names. whilc new groups can't

get hcurd because the record com-
panies urcn‘t willingto give thcmthc
promotional push and ﬁnancial
bucking they need to make it. The
record industry is feeling the effects
of the currcnt economic depression
along with everyone else. the result
