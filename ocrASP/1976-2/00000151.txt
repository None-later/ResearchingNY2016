The great hunting ground 'of Kay-ad-
roa-se~ra, which lay in the angle between
the Hudson and the Mohawk Rivers, was
frequented by the ﬁve nations . . .

Once upon a time it happened that a
young brave from the Mohawk country
had been hunting alone while on his visit
to Kay-ad-ros-se-ra . and being on un-
familiar pound, unaccountany lost his
J way. it was late in the season of the
hunter's moon, the leaves had Jnostly
fallen from the trees, and trembling
J snowflakes of autumn began to whiten
; the brown grass of the wild meadows. The
deer had mostly gone to their winter
. quarters in the deep evergreen .woods, and

the wild fowl had left'the waters and were
off on their southern journey. The In-
dians believe that when they are really
lost; some veil spirit leads them not
straight onward but round and round an
ever narrowing circle, whose centre is
death, which they have no power to leave,
but like a serpant-charmed bird, must
hopelessly perish there unless some good
spirit comes to their relief and breaks the
fatal spell.

in vain the young brave wandered day
after day. in vain he sought some
token,—some broken twig, or upturned
stone, -some hum of bee or ﬂight of bird.
that might lead him home. I

At length, at the close of a weary day a
' large grey owl, seemingly emboldened by
the gathering shade of the swiftly coming
‘ '> night, ﬂew across his path on noiseless
wing, and alighting low down on the bare
projecting limb of a storm-blasted
hemlook,’ turned his large, yellow, staring
eyes upon the sufferer, and boating loud-

but the fiercest blood of the Mohawk . v
still ran in the young brave's veins. Rais- ,

ing his bow with trembling arm, he let an

arrow fly, and the taunting monster layat -
his feet. Seizing his tomahawk, in his hot- I

_ly kindling anger he would have struck
the prostrate bird, when 10! into the

deepening shadows of the fast coming '

night, seemingly from out of the dead
body of the owl, flew a beautiful white

dove. The storm ceased, the clouds blew
i

away.

The dove, fluttering along on silver
wing in the soft light of the rising‘hunter’s
Moon, now led the young brave on
another and better pathway, just as some
mother bird in the spring time is wont to
lead one from her helpless hiding brood '
when danger threatens. '

it was the spirit bird of the wilderness—
the whitedove of Kay-ad-ros-se-ra. it had '
come on its mission that through death:
into life. through night into light, through

sorrow into joy, it might lead the 5
wanderer home.

On the morrow the young brave, led by rt 1 :

the ﬂuttering dove, found his elm bard "
canoe on the shore of the lake.

I have wanted to recreate
the sacred not being far ‘
from the sacred virgin
green Amazon waters

to re-build what was destroyed V
in those deep cliffs of the grey lludson river i
where now the noonday '
smears its clear white gown

aborted child in guts and blood
and marine oil smeared words

h Hudson neither Hudson

our large day of water bones
or any image can hold you
now or should hold you I
And i have felt the image bones o no image can hold you And death stretching in you oh Hudson
of previous lovers' kisses fall
'and i have wanted to recall into existence

 

and tear the ﬁnal word

past the woman's eyes beckoning
men to her hollow chest

Emptiness and cold and sulphur electric branches of a spuning

stretchin from ast to resent
8 p p ﬂame stretch—But oh hold on to that

  
 

where eyes remain open

 

l have heard the poet's hean

go singing in his old canoe

guitar in hand reshaping

the clear-eyed notes of an early age
when Hudson named the waters
as he would name's son

when Hudson named himself water
being son of the waters

1 have wanted to recreate
the sacred my eyes being
bred in the sacred virgin
green waters of the Amazon
but i ﬁnd that the sacred
here is not adored nor respected
for i have felt oh Hudson your rhythm fail
have seen the clock fall in your depths

as ghost ﬁsh skeletons slowly mould about the city;
and i have seen the mechanical kingfisher watchful '

’3' of the World Trade Center

‘, no image or the fading image
of the locusts of darkness

beneath the balustrade of thousands of years
i see the emptiness of an earth crack

and the Indian cry as one

where no death slowly paints

0h river a sick heartbeat empties

By the shops and altar pieces

where a stench of decaying water leaves ' Perhaps you could have saved yourself  - '

blue as the bluest space that gzipcs

to edges where the body

is immeasureably expanded

and cannot touch the body: the
movement to a blue that is

not life the movement

to rainbows spread thickly on
rainbows on the water

ﬂoating as a refracted unconsciousness
blindness of business electric ﬁngers

 

the pleasant smile of the urbanitc
perhaps if you had startled

the urbanitcs with leaps and
bounds the urbanitcs that feed

no time image or the evaporating image
of the tubercular lark of your waters
‘where the lamp’s bell-light

tolls creases on an old face

“days Within yesterdays for you have already torn loose

lam. we have plaud'pmm fish skeletons transparent
as coins om your eyes

from which dying moths

gurgle out piercing the crab's chalk coming:
and the sea-gulls become as they in“
layered shadows on the banks

‘. their feathers slowly evaporating silcncc
leaving bones as dainty ﬁngers

for you were always free of this poem

ﬁtting and taking off water gloves , for you are part of that eternity

And so you live on in me
and others who love you
“for though love might be short, v

(crystal was my mother‘s womb
as night's bright dice we swam)

(by waterways' waylay sand and chalk

   

through decayed bodies
