1 didn’t earn any money recurred. Many nights 'of sleep
7 were disturbed with thoughts that no‘one would show

up to perform. leaving Lori and me to perform for the
full twenty-four hours ourselves. ‘And worse. I feared
that the ballroom would be booked by another group

. "leaving Telethon then to go on out inthe Assembly Hall
. where we again raised only a few hundred dollars.

My fears turned into illness. Several weeks before
Telethon. my roommate rushed me to the inﬁrmary
because of intense stomach pains which were a direct
result of the tension that was building up. But so many
plans still had to be made that lwilled myself better by A
the next morning and l was back to work.

Things really started going wrong the week of
Telethon. McDonald‘s, who had promised us Ronald
for Children‘s Hour suddenly cancelled. They informed
usthat Ronald had died. Later that morning. President
Benezet‘s secretary called to inform us that Benezet
wouldn‘t be able to make it. (Nor did he make a
contribution). ,

As the night of Telethon approached. things finally
started to gel. The clownfromJack-in-the-Box replaced
Ronald (who we later found out had received a paying
offer for the day) and Vice President Welch was sent to
replace Dr. Benezet. Several acts cancelled. but new
ones were found to replace them.

Our parents arrived late in the afternoon to take us
out to dinner. but. because we were so nervous. we sent
them out themselves while we ate rice inthe quad dining

of good news. All the the merchandise we _'

ted for auction and prizes were delivered
0 ' room and left on the stage. “Why on the
'tagie’P'. we‘askcd. Because no one knew where else‘to
put them. ' i » . .-
We hurried-over to the Campus Center and found

everything set up wrong. No one else was there and so '

Lori. in her long dress; and l, in my tuxedo, began
moving tables and chairs and boxes and furniture.

Finally, the audience began to arrive. (This was
another of my greatest fears—that no one would show
up). Lori and i checked last minute details, greetingthe
mayor. and gave the signal for 4+2 Income on stage to
sing “Friends” for the ﬁrst of what seemed like a
hundred times,

We mouthed each line fromthe songwe had heard so
often. As each line passed. we knew our moment on
stage was coming closer and closer. Sweat began
pouring down my face. Suddenly. the last line of the
song was sung and i felt myself walking across the stage.
Several thousand faces were out there before me. “I'm
Lori Gerber.“ she began. “And I'm David Taffet." 1
continued after a nervous pause. “And we‘re the
chairpersons of Telethon ‘74.“ A pause. and then
applause. We relaxed. The audience was friendly.

We hadjust twenty-four more hours to reachthe goal
we had been workingtoward since March of I973. Now.
there was no question that we would not do it. After
introducing the first act. we walked offstage into the
wings. Things began to run themselves and there was
nothing we had to do but relax and enjoy ourselves.

I went back to my parents‘ table to sit down for a few
minutes. My mother was shaking her head. What was
wrong? “You looked so nice." she said reproachingly.
"Couldn‘t you at least put on a decent pair of shoes?” I
looked down at my feet and realized I still had on a pair
of sneakers. In the excitement before going onstage, I
had forgotten to change.

 

 

Onthe l9th of Marchthe Romans
celebrated the Quinquatrus. Though
there has been some controversy
regarding the derivation of the name
of this festival. the probable ex-
planation is that it signiﬁes the ﬁfth
(quimus “fifth") day after the Ides of
March. March 15. (The Romans
counted both ends of a series.)
Originally the day must have been
consecrated to Mars. the Roman
god of war and the patron of the
whole month. Traces of this early
connection were present in the

‘classical period. On that day the

priests of Mars performed a type of
military dance and there was a
ritualistic puriﬁcation of the sacred
shield of the god. Clearly these
ceremonies once symbolized the
puriﬁcation of the whole army and
marked the opening of the war
season.

Later the Quinquatrus was ex-
tcndedtofivc days. from March l9th
through 23rd. and was considered a
festival in honor of Minerva. One
factor in this change was the coin-
cidence of the founding of a temple
of Minerva in Rome on the 19th of

   

March.

A more interesting, and possibly
more important. factor was the role
of a native goddess. Nerio. Though
almost nothing is known of the deity,
she seems to have been associated in
some way with Mars in early times.
Modern scholars have even gone so
far as to see evidence of an elaborate
love-story involving Mars and
Nerio.

In any case. Nerio was apparently
absorbed by the better known
Minerva. As goddess of wisdom
Minerva had the function of
presiding over schools. teachers. and
students. The Quinquatrus became a
school holiday when students ex-
pected to present their teachers with
small gifts of coins. The teachers
may have been expected to make an
offering of the coins to the goddess.
Accordingto Ovid it is Minerva who
acts as a recruiter and brings new
students into it school. 15 our own
Minerva working for us‘.’

And you thought that the only
thing that happened in March was
the assassination of Julius Caesar.
