Freak-Out '

by Larry" Bonchoclty

It usually happens late at night. You were
having another “good time” at Frank‘s, or any
other hoppin‘ Albany hang-out. Yet strangely
you're down. You'vejust sucked away a few
beers. But the corners of your mouth droop.
You ﬁgure a good nite‘ssleep ought to fix you
up. (The beers didn't help out much.) But you
can't sleep. Your thoughts are far from
Albany, cons away from Frank's. Your mind
is hurling—but not from that 'lectric Colum-
bian. Your head only seems to want to focus
on the inevitable of inevitables; the future.

You roll over. You yank at the covers. You
flatten your favorite pillow with the back of
your head. You erase another annoying itch
withascrutch. Butthere‘sstill anitch. It comes
from your insides. But there shouldn‘t be.
Everything seems to be right. The freshmen
chippies haveﬁnully started lookingyour way.
You feel cool when you walk into the Rat. You
always out those nine o‘clock classesuand
that nagging guilt isjustshruggedoff: You‘re a
SUNYA senior.

But you're still down. Not only are you
down, but this strange down quickly grows
into a biting fear. Of the future.

If you are one of the uninitiated. you 
no idea that this could only mean unsettling.
Senior freak-out time arrived. Come

Labor Day. seventeen long years of knowing

exactly whatto do with your bod—has vanish-
ed. You don't have a ready-made excuse to

bum off your parents. You no longer get in on

four day weekends 'cause you‘re partied-out.
Your summer vacations are not summer
vacations. Mortar-board and tassels are a
short two and a half months away.

The senior freak-out is terrifying—or it is
fun. The terror is a result of "I'm the only..."
line of thougth. You feel that this mysterious
case of chronicinsomnia is only happeningto
you. You think to yourself that noone else
feels this way. and noone has ever felt this way.
Except looney-bin people andsuch. When you
realize this you experience a weird. eerie case
of the chills. You pull the covers over your
head.

You. the cowering sufferer ofthis afﬂiction.
are very stone-faced and glassy-eyed. You
become a moper. You're gait is a draggy shuf-
fle. those quick. confident steps are gone. You
Stare at the ground alot. Your shoulders sag.
You believe dooms-day prophets. And
naturally the pleasure you feel for a cake
senior schedule is lost.

The fun of the senior freak-out is when you
know all of this, Only if you have gone
through it, of course. Otherwise you‘re a non-
belicver. Now. you are well aware that the
depths of a late winter nite wrought terror and
shoot fear intothc unsuspecting~you become
prepared. You also go out and huyyoursclfa
nite—Iitc.

Now you enjoy other people‘s freak-outs.
Just look for stone-faces and glassy-eyes. And
that shuffle. The senior freak-out is fun.

Now the future doesn't take on the visage of
a fang-mouthed gargoyle. The prospects of
post—graduation are not clouding the good
times of a last semester picnic. Youjoin the
crowd who prefer to laugh away the midnite
fear of the senior freak-out ~nnd you begin to
have yourself a damn good partying time as
you while away the last few months at your
ninth mater: good ol' Sunny Albany.

by noon  "anti 

The Bicentennial Your bring with into i

patriotic. patriarchal tendency to brandilh
vague assertions about'thé accomplishmerns
of our Founding Fathers—the ones "who
“brought forth a new nation.“ For twohun-
dred years of American“liberty." U.S. women
have been engaged in less spectacular modes

' of “bringing forth”—wc have been more preg-

nant than political. With the continuous cf-
forts of the Feminist Movement (which, in-
cidentally. united American and British
women in these centuries) it might betimelyto
note the effects and achievements of our
Founding Mothers: has the Womens‘ Move-
ment in America had any effect on the basic
unit of patriarchal society? Many changes in
the American family system and structure
have been attributed to the Womens‘ Move-
ment. a social and political force concerned
with changing the roles of women and with
womens' freedom to determine their own lives.

In the years following the early Womens'
Suffrage drives. (culminating in US. womens'
cnfranchisement in I920) American
sociologists reported drastic trend changes in
American families: economic. protective.
recreational. status-cndowing. educational.
and religious functions of the family were be-
ing transferred to other institutions.

Accompanying this structural reduction
was a decline in familistic priorities. but reten-
tion of two major remaining functions:
procreation and affection. The conjugal fami-
Iy model. in which the love relationship is the
main bond and source of emotional support.
has become the norm replacingthe extended
family kinship network. It securelyensconced
woman in the home . . . as a ﬁxture.

World War II accelerated recognition of
womens‘ equality on thejob and as head oftlie
family: the post-war Baby Boom of the 50‘s
was superseded by a signifigant decline in
birth rate in the 60's. when a new wave of

  
    
 
    

peon-

perpetuating infe’rior images and treat
women: v A , ' , A ‘r
The Movement is directly responsible for;
subsequent establishment of daycare center»;
birth control and abortion-clinics. and'n’ew
legislationébut only intheform of ruliri’bn
individual cases—regarding these and r
decisions in custody. divorce. alimony. child-
support. and maternal
employment[discrimination proceedings. .
Result? steady declines in birth rate and
number of children per family; steadyinclines
in divorce rates. childless meninges. abor-
tions. pre- and extramarital sex (here the in-
crease has been in honesty. not activity!) and
the number of women in thejob market and
academic ﬁelds. TWo trends-the rising number
of marriages and lower average age at
marriage—have completely reversed. accom—
panied by decline in the ' number of-
remarriages and patterns of permanent
marriage. New lifestyles (cooperative child-
care. single parents) have emerged. followed
by agencies designed to foster and deal with
these.

Reaction has varied widely. and
reactionaries have objected loudly. Deter-
mined to uphold their Ideal of lnequalitthey
denounce these changes as negative
manifestations. when indeed they are postive
signs that all Americans are now declaring in-
dependence. "Jane Hancock" has signed the
E.R.A.. which is even now suffering its Valley
Forge—a reminder that only one-half of
today's Americans enjoy full freedom. The
l4th Amendment is as inadequate to women
as King George's edicts were insufﬁcient to the
Colonies; full recognition and legal ratiﬁca-
tion of the E. R.A. are the only hallmarks of
full equality.

It‘s as American as Dad and Apple Pie.
