Although Marvin. :Miller. ex-

and order the camps opened. they
remained closed.

This would indicate that the
owners had not seen sufﬁcient
progress.

A spokesman for the com-

.missioner said Kuhn had pretty

much made up his mind before
Miller‘s announcement Wenesday
that the union‘s executive board
would decline to take action on the
owners‘ ﬁnal proposal.

Committee Informed

The spokesman sttid the com-
missioner made up his mind and
then informed the Player Relations
Committee. the bargaining agent for
the owners.

Because of the number of players
in the spring training areas. the
spokesman felt the camps. in one
form or another. could be opened on
Thursday.

John Gaherin. chief bargaining
agent or the owners. has been asked
to advise the clubs Wednesday as to
the procedures to be followed in in-
viting the players to camp.

A meeting of owners is scheduled
for Saturday in New York.

In Tampa. the 24 elected represen-
tatives of the major Icagueclubs also
asked that the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service be brought
into the negotiations.

 _ \

The "representatives also asked
that the basic agreement, which has
expired. be extended until a new
agreement can be arranged and that
the no-strike. no-lockout provision
be reinstated.

The resolution strongly urged
owners to open spring training
camps. which have been closed dur.
ing the negotiating process.

The tone of the executive board’s
resolution was in sharp contrast to
the militant stance taken by Miller
and sonic 30 players at an informal
review of the offer Tuesday in St.
Pctcrsburg.

Miller said at that time that he
would recommend rejection and at
reading of the players' sentiment led
him to believe that the players were
of the same mind.

John Gahcrin. chiefnegotiutor for
the owners. said his Player Relation
Committee was "advising the clubs
by Teletype how they should func-
tion in the way of inviting players
and what particular spring training
allowances should be in effect."

However. indications were that
most clubs would get under way
Thursday or Friday.

Serious Training

Teams that expressed a desire to
start serious training Thursday in-
cluded the Boston Red Sox. Califor-
nitt Angels. Cincinnati Reds.
Cleveland Indians. Montreal Expos.
New York Yankees. Philadelphia
I’hillies and San Francisco Giants.

 

 

WOMENS’ SPORTS:

Uncoordinated Octopus?

 

 

by Christine Bellini

It has always amazed me to see the coordinated movements ofan octopus.
Master of'it‘s natch waters. the mollusk's eight legs are no insurmountable
difficulty to operate; in fact. they work quite well together—as if all eight

appendages were necessary.

After spending ticonsidcrublc amount oftime coveringtltc various Albany
State women's sports for the Albany Slut/ml Prt‘A‘S. in hopes of stimulating
some outside interest and support from the university community for
women's athletics. | find myself once ttgatn quite amazed.

Had I not by chance been interested in the dcbtttttble ﬁeld of athletics
(more questionable in the case of women's athletics). l mightttssumcthatthe
most minimal progrttm existed in the women's athletic department at
SUN YA. I set out to try to increase tiliti improve the women‘s program‘s
publicity. Luckily for me. I had no one to cotnpctc with for the job. Life

should only continue to be so easy.

llut it wasn't too long beforcl was correctly informed. t banks to tltosc who
work within the dcpttrtmcnt. that it just isn’t so. Contraron populttr belief.
the women‘s physicul education department here til Albany State is in good
shttpc. both instructionally ttnd intercollegititcly.

With two Rhetoric and Communication courses underneath my belt. 1
think it safe to diagnose tt threatening case of mitt-communication.

back to the octupus. Now. mark me if I am wrong. but it seems rather
convenient and logical that all eight arms. legs. or whatever they be. work
together. I ﬁnd it hard to fathom tin octopus whose legs desire to move in
eight separate directions. lfunything. it would be rather frustrating. You see.
the octopus has a good sense of internal support. Each leg hus enough sense
to support the others. and as a result. the mollusk successfully reaches it s

destination.

Strange where we find our examples. isn‘t it? But how can one argue with
success? Perhaps if the various women athletes in tennis. basketball.
gymnastics. volleyball. swimming and diving. track and ﬁeld and softball
bcgttn to show u Iittlcintcrcst in their sister sports as spectators fit each other's
events. the battle of developing the program would be half won. Playing
basketball in a comparatively empty gymnasium is far from rewarding or

supportive.

Those of us who maintain that we a

re Interested must take the burden off

of the coaches‘ shoulders and lean it upon each other. The tennis player must
visually support swimming and diving. just as leg number 4 must move
toward the same direction as leg number 7. if the program Is to continue to

A little octopus-sense never hurt anyone. Just look at that silly mollusk.

Telethon ‘76 proceeds are ex- ’

pected to exceed 524.000. according
to its treasurer Stu Benkendorf. “As
of now." he said “we have~$23.l00.
and checks are still coming in."

Gail Seibcl. Telethon co-
chairperson said that this year‘s
"Children's Hour was the most
successful in the history of SUNYA
telethons."

Bcnkcndorf said this segment rais-
ed $300 more than it did last year.

Don Bisbko. an instructor in the
Business department. received the
highest amount of money as a
recipient of a pie in the face. He rais-
ed the S340total by collecting money
in his classes. One of Bishko‘s
students said. “He has a high curve
and a low curve. and the curve he
uses will be dependent on how much
money the pic raises for Telethon."

Hundreds of people ﬁlled the
Campus Center Ballroom. The
children of Wildwood were seated in
the front row ofthe room surround-
ed by balloons. lights and cameras.

"The deep sense of the weekend's
happenings." stated one mother.
“has by no means escaped the
children.“

When asked what he thought of

The State Board of Audit and

utilities. rent. and maintenance of
space used on all SUNY campuses.
according to FSA General Manager
E. Norbert Zrihm.

The Board may decide as early as
Friday and would probably imple-
ment the plan next semester.

The Fast Fourier Transform
Spectrometer. as it is called. will
detect ultra-short radio impulses
from space and will be capable of
removing distortions from these
signals. This will rcveultlte radiation
tts originated from such sources as
distant technological civilizations.

The spectrometer will be attached
to the newly-completed Frank L.
Fullttm Radio Telescope. the sixth
largest of its kind itt the country. It is
located on SUNYA‘s Lu Rose cum-
pus near Lake George.

SUNYA contributed $l0.00tl to
the building of the telescope. ttnd
awarded Erkcs n grant of the some
amount to help build it. SUNYA
owns the land. while the Dudley
Observatory owns the telescope.

Erkcs said [hill the telescope was
put on SUNYA's property "to cc-
ment the relationship between
SUNYA ttnd the observatory."

Though the astonomy depart ment
will be terminated. Vice President of
Academic Affairs Philip Sirotkin
said that “wherever possible. we'll
continue this close cooperation with
the observatory." Sirotkin added.
" President Fields is a member ofthe
bottrd til the observatory. and has a
good rcltttionship with the obser-
vatory‘s nominal Itead from Union
College." 1

Curtis lIemcnwny of SUNYA‘s
astonomy department is currently
the obscrvutory‘s director.

Of the six astronomy faculty
positions. his was the only one not
retrcnchcd last June.

Assistant Chairman of the
astronomy department Frank
Jcttncr said. “If llcmenway is
rctrencbed too. there writ he no one
left to teach astronomy."

Sirotkin said yesterday. “After

reading I’rcsidcnt Field's decision
and the report ofthe Task Forccthut
eliminated the astronomy program.
it looks like Dr. Ilcmcuway‘s faculty
position has also been eliminated."

Jcttncr added. “The original
Select Committee considered a con-
sortum with other schools. but
decided at consortum wouldn‘t be
workable tlterc Weren't enough
schools teaching astronomy in the
area to do it.“ SUNYA has the only
astronomy program lettding to an
undergraduate degree in the urea.

Iirkcs criticized the original Select
Committee‘s methods. “The original
Select Committee report. which was
never published by the administra-
tion. said the department was poor
at raising money. The statistics
showed money awarded to through
the university. however. through the
SUNYA Foundation. They forgot
the agreement with the Dudley
Observatory. which got the fcdcrttl
funds."

.lettnet' noted thttt all SUNYA
astronomy professors except one
Jerry Weinberg-do their research
at the observatory. "Most grants
from the SUNYA Foundation. ex-
cept for Dr. Weinberg‘s. have been in
the H.000 range the last few years.
while ttt Dudley they‘ve totalled
millions.“

Observatory llurt

lirkes contends that the elimintt-
tion of astronomy at SUNYA will
hurt the observatory by making it
more difficult to secure funds.

“llttving to put $20,000. an
associative professor's sttlttry. ontop
of ii grunt more titan doubles it'. it'll
be harder to get grants: we compete
with other university people whose
salaries are picked up bythe univer-
sity."

said Zahm. “it would clean us right
out of every penny we had. It may

Zahm estimates that FSA would be
able to absorb the chttrgc for at least
the first year. At 5400.000. it would
have to be passed on to students im-
mediately. so Zahm is pressingthe
State for tt decision.

"We lutd asked tltcnt to comment

is that our housing contracts are

fact. some schools have done so

have to tear up those contracts and

create additional costs and time

SA Controller. Stu Klein. agrees
with Ztthnt: “It‘s really a verysneaky
way of getting more money from the

for the board. When they start

screaming at the State. wlto‘sthc real

to suddenly start charging FSA after
26 years. since it is practically—
though not legally—a stttte institu-
