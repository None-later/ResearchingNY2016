,n't. flluchan'att h be voiced his
reason for entering military service
,in I970:

For senior Steve Arnold, the
motivation was a draft number of 6,
failing'high school grades and an

‘ comment to a .‘rl in the Army.To

Joe Tabaco, the Air Force had been

a way out of a stagnant social scene

of bailing out and committing petty

crimes and pranks.

These men help 4 to make up
SUNYA’s veteran population. They
joined the service for varied reasons
and have different complaints about
working for Uncle Sam. Now they
are students taking advantage of
veterans‘ educational beneﬁts, and
although adjustments have been
hard they are glad they are served.

Back in I967, Tabaco‘s friends in
New Hyde Park, Long Island would
“steal a car and leave the hubcaps.”
or go down to Greenwich Village
and “roll a fag”

Tabaco had little imerest in
school work then. except for
technical courses like auto shop and
computer programming. He didn't
have the grades for college, and he
didn't see any sense in it.

Buchanan disliked the Navy.
which he says wouldn't let him be an
individual. He was reprimanded for
hitchhiking back to base. and once
denied permission to say good-bye.
on his last night in the service, to a
buddy on—duty.

Aloha Hawaii

Tabaco spoke of a fellow ser-
viceman “promised Hawaii" upon
entry but given four years of
Brooklyn's Floyd Bennett's naval air
station instead. Now it all seems
worth it. Presently. the Veterans Ad-
ministration gives Buchanan $270
monthly for 45 montla of un-
deryaduate work. And on a per-
sonal level. Buchanan thanks the
Navy “for giving me the kick in the
ass I needed.”

Tobaco tells of friends given a
choice of ‘the Marines or jail‘ lear-
ning askill in the Corps, andthen go-
ing on to open a garage or motorcy-
cle shop in civilian life. In Tabaco‘s
old neighborhood “no one.” in-
cluding himself. “had any sense of
direcﬁon." but when the Air Force
trained him in meteorological
studies Tabaco was given the respon-
sibility of saving lives through
weather forecasting. At present
Tabaco majors in Atmospheric
Science here at SUNYA, while the
Air Force helps pay his way.

from :l970 to 1973. spoke of 
problems of adjusting to a civilian.
scholastic world. Living in a dorm
where some freshmen are eight years
younger than he. Arnold doesn‘t
care for college pranks like turning
off dorm lights or pullinglire alarms.

Arnold says his mind works
differently than his younger
schoolmates. “I grew up inthe ‘60's
. . . the young people are much
more apathetic (than I am) . . . a
veteran becomes more concerned
because he's been through a lot.”

Tabaco's adjustment problem was
ﬁnancial. As a civilian he now has to}
pay for food and shelter, and he has
to support his wife and son on $366a
month.

Arnold said that the American
public doesn't want to think about
the veteran, and that vets themselves
aren't always aware of the govern-'
ment beneﬁts they can obtain.

Arnold is Vice-President of
SUNYA's Veterans Club. which ex-'
ists he says partly to inform vets
about their rewards. and partly to
allow vets to meet others of their
sameage and background. He would
liketo see the Club drawa big chunk
of SA funds and use it to put on
events fortheestimated 800 SUNYA
veterans. But he doesn‘t know if the
Club will get offthe ground. since he
says attendance at meetinﬁ has been

 

so poor.
For the beneﬁt of the rest of the
student population. Buchanan

summed up the attitude of these
three men toward militaryservice: “I
wouldn’t recommend it unless you're
lost and have no direction. It's good
if you need discipline."

by Cary I. ﬂit

Poor intelligence brought the Un-
ited States to the brink ofangdeaIt
war in I973. but the same inept deci-
sion makers have yet to be replaced.
the House Intelligence Committee
has concluded.

In Vietnam, the committee adds.
intelligence decisions constituted
some of the greatest misjudgments of
the war.

The committee‘s 338-page report
on American intelligence
operations. especially the CIA, was
published in part last month in the
New York City weekly The Village
Voice and was reprinted in the
Schenectady weekly The New
Citizen.

All of the CIA‘s and Defense In-
lelligcrtcc Agency‘s technology and
human skills were focused on the
Mideast in October. I973, but their
performances were complete
failures, the committee said. On Oct.
(1. I973. Egypt and Syriulaunchedu
major assault across the Suez Canal
and Golan Heights againstastunned
Israel. The war cost Americans in
terms of u U.S.-Soviet confrontation
that took place three Weeks later and
the subsequent Arab oil embargo
mostly because U.S. intelligence per—
formed miserably. the committee
declared.

The ClA‘s principal conclusions
concerning possible hostile actions
at that time “were quite simply, ob-
viously and starkly wrong." accor-
ding, to the committee.

particularly bad period for Arab-
Isracli relations, and the report con-
cluded that Egypt's President Sadat,
for political reasons, would be
strongly tempted to resort to arms if
talks proved fruitless. “Resumption
of hostilities by autumn will become
a better than even bet" if diplomacy
fails. the report said.

Less than a week before the at-
tack, despite written reports and oh-
vious political tension between the
Arab countries and Israel. the CIA
argued that the chances of war “were
not likely.’I

The committee report said
“analytical bias“ led to the inept
decision. The CIA and the DIA had
concluded that the Arab ﬁghting
man “lacks the necessary physical
and cultural qualities for performing
effective military services" and also
did not think Egypt was capable of
mounting it full assault across the

memorandum was issued. It was a

Suez Canal. Intelligence thought
"the Arabs were so clearly inferior
that another attack would be
irrational, and thus out of the ques-
tion," the report said.

Sources, just before Egypt's at-
tack, fcd the CIA with information
which indicated that imminent war
was a distinct possibility, but the
sources were not believed, “for some
reason still unclear." the committee
said. Every serious indicator pointed
to war, but the CIA did nothing
about it.

The fault may well lie in the repor-
ting system, the committee conclud-
ed.

The National Security Agency
read the indicators correctly, but in-
tercepts of war preparations turned
into written reports so voluminous,
averaging hundreds each week, that
few analysts had time to digest more
than a small portion ofthcm. Also.
some of the reports were gross un-

   
   

derstatements. Just two days before
the war. with obvious Arab move-
ment in the deserts. the CIA was say-
ing it was a “ho-hum“ day in the
Mideast.

The committee report had a few
bad words for Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger.

“There was testimony that Dr.
Kissingcr’s secrecy may also have
thwarted effective intelligence
unulysis. Kissinger httd beenin close
contact with boththe Soviets and the
Arabs throughout the pre—war
period. He. presumably. wusinu un-
iquc positionto pick upindications
of Arab dissatisfaction with
diplomatic talks, and signs of an
ever-increasing Soviet belief that
war would soon break out." but he
never passed any signs to the in-
telligence community. the com-
mittee said.

Having no plan for the area. the

CIA and DIA quickly found

"The greatest misjudgment of the
war." the committee said. was caus-
cd by “our degraded image of the
enemy."

Disputes between the Military
Assistance Command in Vietnam
and the CIA created false percep-
tions ofthc enemy. U.S. forcesfaced
and prevented measurement of
changes in enemy strength overtime.
Also. pressure from policy making
officials to produce positive in-
telligence indicators reinforced
erroneous assessments of allied
progress and enemy capabilities.

“The numbers game not only
diverted a direct confrontation with
the realities of war in Vietnam. but
also prevented the intelligence com-
munity. perhaps the President, and
certainly members of Congress,
from judging the real changes in

Vietnam over time."
