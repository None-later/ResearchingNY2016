WITCH RIGHTS; =

The Colorado Civil Rights Cont-
mission has scheduled n hearing later
this month to decide if a woman can
be tired from her job simply because
she is a witch. v 7

Kathy Estes. the mother of two.
who was ﬁred from hcrjobas a hotel
cashier. claims she was dismissed
simply because she admits practicing
witchcraft in the privacy of her own\
home. .

She had asked to be reinstated un-
der the Colorado State Civil Rights
Law which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of race, sex. creed or
religion. Estes claims she was ﬁred
on the basis of her creed.

Estes was dismissed from her job
after a male employee allegedly
received a dead ﬂower in the mail.
and the hotel management inter-
preted this as an attempt by Estes to
cast some kind of hex.

Estes states she does not practice
black magic or cast hexcs. She says
“I didn't [go to work] in black robes.
l practiced in the privacy of my
home. And I want my job back“.

FORIEGN MADNESS

High Times Magazine has
published a letter in its current
(March) issue containing more
allegations about the reported tor-
ture of Americans In Mexicanjails.

Thelctter. which is just one of
dozens of eyewitness reports
reaching the US in recent months.
alleges that agents of-thc US Drug
Enforcement Administration have
been present when American in-
mates were brutally tortured.

The Ictter-writer. identiﬁed as
Robyn Evermrtn. writing from the
Santa Marta Prison in Mexico City.
claims that in one instance. an
American grandmother was madeto
stand barefoot in cold water while
she was repeatedly shocked on the
genitals.

Everman adds that electric cattle
prods are commonly used against in-
itiates. none of whom has ever been
permitted to contact an attorney.

The letter-writer speciﬁcally iden-
tiﬁes one DEA agent named Arthur
Sedillo. budge number I944. as be-
ing present during a particularly
brutal torture session of a young
male inmate.

US ofﬁcials in Mexico. who at
first denied that such torture was go-
ing on. now admit toit. but say they
are powerless to intercede.

Wesley Pomeroy. considered one of
the Nation‘s toplaw enforcement ctr-
pert: on drug abuse. told a Bay Area
seminar last week that he favors the
dccriminalization notonly of heroin
but of all other illicit narcotics as
well.

Pomcroy stated he considered

FILLED JAILS

You‘ve heard of “No Vacancy“
signs. but in jail? Gloria Kent. was
sentenced to serve a 75-dayjail term
in Bend. Oregon. recently. but she's
having trouble getting a reservation
for it ccll.

Kent. who works during
weekdays. was given permission by
the judge to “do her time” on
weekends for various drug-related
charges.

Kent attempted to do so on the
following wcckcnd. bttt was turned
away from the prison by ofﬁcials
who said there was no room in the
County‘s only jail cell for women.

For several months Kent
tclcphoncd Deschutes County
Sheriff F. Sholcs each week to see if
cell space was available. and every
weekend he denied her request to go
to jail.

Finally. several weeks ago. the no
vacancy sign went down. and Kent
has been allowed to complete six
days of her sentence. Sheriff Sholcs
says. however. that he can‘t estimate
how long it might take the woman to
finally put in all of her 75jaildays.

POSTAL SERVICE

SECRET -

California Congressman Charles
Wilson says that the U. S. Post Office
maintains a secret depot in Detroit
where it hides packages that have
been badly damaged by the Postal
Service.

Accordingto Wilson. who toured
the facility earlier this week. the
thousands of parcels and packages
are so badly defaced and such anem-
barrassment to the Post Ofﬁce. they
are kept under guard behind 3 l2-
l'oot fence so the public can‘t see
them.

Wilson says that his visit to the
compound conﬁrmed what he term-
ed “Horror Stories" related to him
by postal workers. Wilson says that
“lfthc public could gothroughthese
bulk mail centers themselves and see
the packages. they'd be terribly dis-
turbed at what the Postal Service is
doing to them."
