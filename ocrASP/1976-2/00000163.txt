 ‘Meded;

by Naomi Friedlender

Theatre-in-the-r'ound presents
one of the most captivating aspects
of drama: it permits the audience to
interact with the players and to
assume an active position in the

V course of the action. Phenomenal as
this may sound, the players andtheir
audience were fused together in
SUNYA‘s production of Euripedes'
Medea last Friday night.

Under the direction of Edward,
Mendus, Associate Professor of
theatre, nine actors performed this
Greek tragedy in the PAC Arena
Theatre. The proximity of the
players to their surrounding viewers
gave the production its vitality and
the energy needed to convey the
demonic evil Medea represents. ,

Set designerI Joseph Zubrovich,
created asimple, rustic environment
to symbolize the legend of Medea.
The heavily draped props. the shells.
and the sand were not realistic ex-
ponents of ancient Greece but
emblents of any coastal setting The
audience was viewing a classic as
feasibly current as any modern
horror story.

Pamela Burri, Costume Designer,
added to this effect with her long.
weighty robes, reminiscent of Greek
garments. However, her effects were
poorly highlighted by the lighting
which only rarely complemented the
set.

Deborah Lee Smith brilliantly

portrayed Medea. with the venom
and bitchiness essential to the
character of this vengeful woman.

Her facial contortions and gestures

accented her magnetic voice and
produced a captivating, awesome
ﬁgure. Ms. Smith, without excep-
tion. carried the play. However. she
was well supported by Pearl

Stratyner, the Nurse. whoadtnirabiy
displayed a quiet energy and deter-
mination. The two women, Debora

Beechert and Deborah Dodge,
demonstrated their talents in their
solo performances though their
choruses had a choppy. singsongy
effect.

On the whole. the male performers
in Medea were invariabl y disappoin-
ting. Curt Richardson, as Jason, was
a passive, unemotional ﬁgure rather
than the dynamic hero depicted in
Greek legends. while Robert
Marcello's Creon was little more
than a stick ﬁgure. mouthing lines
and awkwardly gesturing. Even the
Attendant, a minor role played by
J. E. Parker, was a bland. shallow
character, talking insuch an obvious
monotone that it was blatantly ap-
parent that Parker was bored with
his part. Only Larry Harris. as
Aegeus, displayed the dynamism
and strength typifying the Greek
hero.

Georgia Rucker‘s original flute
pieces echoed through the Arena
Theatre, emphasizingthe eerie. pier-
cing tone of Medea. The music
chilled each viewer as he synt-
pathized with , Medea‘s woe and
became the character's reluctant,
awed accomplice.

‘ The Albany Byliphmly enm- and Conductor Julius Hegyl. ‘

  
  
 

d,.

Albany 'SMphony:

by. Stephen Eisetunu‘t ,

An evening spent with the Albany
Symphony Orchestra always proves
to be challenging. After struggling
through the long line at the box of-
ﬁce to pick up my reserved tickets. 1
was told that they had been given
away to some other Eisenman from
the ASP. Some haggling ﬁnally con-
vinced them that l was the real Mc-
Coy and i took two other seats, anx-
ious for the music to begin.

Here at Albany's Palace Theatre
we heard more than just music: i
heard ushers snickering, men with
perfect lungs coughing like con-
sumptives, and ladies with big hats
discussing the conductor‘s suit. But.
i told myself, this is not New York
City. be patient.

The performance of the music in
the first half of the concert demand-
ed patience. Schoenberg's Five
Pieces/or Orchestra, an outstanding
early work by the master of the l2
tone scale, was poorly conceived by
conductor Julius Hegyi. Where the
work demanded crisp stops and
starts, the musicians were sluggish.
Where tempos needed to be quickly

stepped up or down, Hegyi guided
his orchestra through the backdoor.
For this piece to be effective, it must
be sharp, emboldened by rapid shifts
in tempo and dynamics.

The second work, Beethoven's
Fourth Symphony, was the scene of
another struggle. The ﬁrst move-
ment was very sloppy. A few of the
strings struck bad notes, damaging
the sound of the entire string section.
The pacing was too deliberate and
the horns sounded as if they were
drowning. The third movement,
marked by some brilliant solo
clarinet writing, failed to achieve any
degree of lyricism. The strings once
again slid into passages that
demanded assertiveness.

The second half of the concert was
much better than the first. it began
with a performance of Cesar Frank‘s
Symphonic Variations for Piano
and Orchestra, with soloist
Theodore Lettvin.Mr. Lettvin, a
large man with massive arms and
hands. displayed a masterly control
of the keyboard. He executed the
most difﬁcult of passages with ease
and sensitivity, ranging over the

piano as if it were a mere toy. The
orchestra, perhaps inspired by this
ﬁne musicianship, performed Well.

The ﬁnal work of the evening was
Franz Liszt‘s “Dance of Death" for
piano and orchestra. This work,
composed of one simple theme from
which a myriad of variations are
spun. is great fun. it is loud and
crashing at times, soft and ethereal at
others. it is largely an exercise in
master pianist technique, with runs
up and down the keyboard, trills.
and other pianistic pyrotechnics.
Lettvin performed them all with
relish. He expressed the music‘s
romantic demonic nature, bringing
to mind late medieval paintings of
the Last Judgment. Again the
orchestra seemed more at ease in the
role of accompanists.

The next and last concert of the
season promises to be a good one.
with works by Bizet and
Moussorgsky. i shall attend, an-
daunted by rude ushers or tuberculin
listeners. Who knows, perhaps the
Albany Symphony Orchestra will be
great. perhaps the lines will be
shorter.
