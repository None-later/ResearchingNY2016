Tuition and room hikes of $l00
each were approved by the SUNY
Board of Trustees ,on Wednesday.

The increases. which will take effect '

inthe fall semester. will bringtuition
charges for freshmen and
sophomores upto $750. and $900 for
juniors and seniors.

The hi kes will account for most of
a 525 million dollar revenue increase
called for by Governor Carey‘s l976—
77 budget. “While we deeply regret
the necessity oftakingthis action. we
have no choice." said SUNY Board
Chairman Elisabeth Moore. “The
university must live within the ap-
propriation it receives. and try to
generate the revenue requicd by the
state.“

SASU President Bob Kirkpatrick
called the decision of the Trustees
"irresponsible." and claims that it
was “a monetary decision and not an
educational one.“

The Board of Trustees is responsi-
ble for the determination of the
educational policy of the university.
and in the past. according to
Kirkpatrick. they have acted careful-
ly and with the university‘s best in-
terests in mind. “This year. all they
did was blindly rubber-stamp
somethingthat was mandated bythe
legislature.“

The trustees have the final word
on the increases. Kirkpatrick ad-
mitted that SASU has no legal or

bureaucratic recourse to their deci-
sion and no standard route of
appeal. Although ageneral strike
has been discussed, no immediate
plans have been made.

SUNY receives income from three
sources: tuition. dormitory charges
and hospital rcventtc. This income is
applied to university construction
bonds and the remainder goes tothe
state budget.

In orderto help meet the increased
revenue line for next year. SUNY
graduate and professional program
tuitions will also be raised. (irad uate
students will have to pay an increase
of $200. while those in professional
programs will be charged $400 more
for law. optometry and pharmacy
and $600 more for medicine and den-
tistry. ‘

Grad Rites

Non-resident students of New
York will be hit even harder. Un-
dergraduates will face increases of
$l25 and $200 for lower-classmen
and upper-classmen. respectively.
Graduates will have to pay another
$300. while professional students
will find tuition for law. optometry
and pharmacy up $1.000. and
medicine and dentistry up $|.200.

This increase means that SUNY
students will be paying one third of
the cost of their education. main-
taining SUNY‘s position among the
most expensive state schools in the
nation.

SUNY Students Dissolve Their Sit-Ins

The last of the student
demonstrators protestingthe budget
cuts at Old Westbury. Buffalo State
and Purchase broke up their sit-ins
early Wednesday morning.

Students at Old Westbury gave up
control of the administration
building at 3:30 am. on Wednesday
after their president agreed to all of
their demands. Unlike the other
schools, Old Westbury had no firm
commitment supportingthe demand
for open SUNY trustee meetings.
Their demands were Incal. dealing
specifically with their own school.

After an unsuccessful attempt to
institute a general strike earlier this
week. students at Purchase left their
administration building at 9:00 a.m.
Wednesday. In a press release issued
at tha.‘ time. the students said they
were leaving with good faith in the
'l‘rustces' decision on open meetings.
They were afraid. according to one
spoksman. that occupation of the
building would unfavorany in-
fluence that decision.

Buffalo State also left their ad-
ministration building at nine am.
Wednesday. One of the
demonstrators said. “We left in
solidarity with Purchase."

Purchase bused students down to
the SUNY Board of Trustees
meeting in Manhattan. as did all the
other protesting schools: Binghani-
ton. New l’altz. Old Westbury. Buf-
fan State. Fredoniu. and SUNY
Buffalo. The Trustees allowed six
PurchaSe delegates to enter the
meeting. and approximately l00
remaining students demonstrated
quietly outside the building.

Accordingto Russ Gugino, Assis-
tant to the Vice Chancellor tor Un-
iversity Affairs. the Board of

Trustees passed a resolution
Wednesday afternoon calling for a
uni versity-wide meeting in Albany in
conjunction with the Trustees‘ board
meeting on April 28. In a statement
released bythe Board. the purpose of
the meeting was stated to be for
"Conducting discussions concerning
position of the university for long
and short range future. specifically
utilizing recommendations of The
Committee on Purposes and
Priorities and the proposed I976

master plan."

All seven schools held indepen-
dent meetings Wednesday evening
after the Trustees‘ meeting. but only
Binghamton emerged witha positive
course of action: a general strike on
Monday. Students from the other
six campuses support the idea of a
strike and agree that if held state-
wide it would be more effective. but
Purchase. New Pain. and SUNY
Buffalo have already indicated that
they are planning their strikes for

State Orders Shorter

by Frank Helmkc

A state-ordered budget cutback of
5205.000 is going to shorten the
work year and cut the pay of some
150 SUNYA employees.

Vice President for Management
and Planning John Hartley said
recently that the administration
hopes most of the cuts in work year
and pay can be effected voluntarily
(by employees asking for them). but
be indicated some may have to be
ordered.

The cutback. mandated in Gover-
nor Carcy‘s l976-77 budget. could
affect I5 SUNYA faculty members
and I40 non-teaching professionals
(NTP‘s) and civil service employees
who are now on 12-month ap-
pointments. Hartley said those
whose work contracts are reduced to
it) months could consequently have
their salaries reduced by l6.67 per
cent.

in SUNYA's recent concern with
the Task Force cutback proposals.
this additional budget reduction has
gone almost unnoticed. The state

budget mandates that all SUNY
campuses must shorten work con-
tracts to save a total of $2 million.
SUNYA‘s pan in the savingis $205.-
000.

in his Report on Priorities and
Resources last week. SUNYA Presi-
dent Emmett Fields said. “Wc are
expected. also. to realize $205,000 in
other savings by shorteningthe work
year of some employees. to the ex-
tent possible through individual
voluntary choice."

Hartley suggested two ways in
which the $205,000 could be saved.
The ﬁrst ofthese is holding positions
vacant when vacancies arise. and
then possibly reducing the position
to a iii-month appointment. The se-
cond is reducing the contracts of
faculty members remaining on 12-
month contracts to to months.

Leave Without Pay

The Office for Management and
Planning has also been canvassing
the campus for volunteers to take a
leave of absence without pay.
Hartley says. "We undoubtedly

later in the week.

The demonstrators have been
joined by a City University of New
York school. Hostos Community
College in the Bronx. After learning
that CUNY planned to eliminate
Hostos. students rallied and gained
control. not just of the administra-
tion building. but of the whole
school. They have promised not to
leave until CUNY publicly declares
their intentions of keeping the
school. —5. Raggio

Contracts

think there are people who would
likelo be off in the summer despite a
cut in pay."

The lloard of Trustees recently
passed a resolution in which N'l‘P‘s
would be hired under “college year"
appointments. Such appointments
would specifically affect NTP‘s. but
not civil service employees.

The greatest difficulty in meeting
the budget demands for the
forthcoming year. Hartley said. was
finding a way to reduce civil service
contracts from a l2- to a [0-month
basis.

Summer Reductions

Hartley added that library. bus
service. and student health service
employees could he reduced in the
summer when the need for them was
at its least. He said. “The university
is more slack in the summer months
than in the winter months."

Hartley emphasized. “We cannot
approach this matter in the same
way that the Task Force approaches
culling programs. The mechanism
here is extremely " ‘ ‘ "

$l00.000 for utilities aloneto $400.-
000 if the State decides that
maintenance and rent are to be in-
cluded in the hill. according to
Zahm.

Future Increase

Zahm said Wednesday that FSA
would not be able to absorb the loss
past next year. He saidthat although
it isn‘t fair. the brunt of the burden
will be passed to on-cumpus
students. Figuring on the minimum
charge of Sl(ltl.tl00. Zahm said the
increase would amount to about SIS
per student.

Zahm said that to equalize the
effects of the increase. everyone
might be paying more for coffee.
bowling and pinball.

Amount Unknown

Zahm said that he still did not
know the exact amount that the
State Board of Audit and Control is
planning to charge. As reported in
last Tuesday's Albany Student
Press. Zahm had asked for a
response by today. because housing
contracts are almost rcadyto go out.

l-‘SA‘s abilityto absorb next year's
loss eradicates any need to tear up
present contracts. and printing ones
with higher board prices here.
However. if the State imposes these
charges they will apply to all FSA‘s
at SUNY schools. The effect they
would have will depend ontheftnan—
cial status of each corporation.
