most serious and the most damning
issue is that of safety.

The most frightening thing about

_’ nuclear safety is that by the time we
realize the damage. it will be too late.

The existence of a nuclear industry
implies the continuous release of
small amounts of radiation and
deadly toxins. Health effects from
radiation include leukemia. cancer.
and genetic damage.

When considering the possible
health effects from a muclcar power
plant. there are four areas of interest.
The ﬁrst is the release of small
amounts of radioactive materials
and toxins in the course of normal
operation. The second is it fast
release of large amounts ofthcse by
an unexpected catastrophy among
which are; meltdowus. and the
destruction ofthe plant bysabotage.
earthquake. or conventional bom-
bing. The third is a release of these
same materials by improperly sealed
reactor wastes. And the last is a rapid
and widespread release of fuel or-
wastes in transport. I

of ore into useable fuel is a material
. referredto as tailings.‘Tailiny are
left; in large heaps around. 'ore
processing centers and release a con-
stant amount of radioactive gases. In
the course of normal operation the
reactor itself will release a very small

but not nonexistent amount of '

radiation. The radiation from these
two sources are expected and would
be the only radiation released if the
plant operates optimally and there
are no accidents.

The event referred to before as a
meltdown is. as the name imples.
when the core gets so hot that is
physically melts. If this were to
happen. the core would melt it's way
through it’s containments. crack the
protective shell. and allow huge
amounts of radioactive gases and
dust to enter the atmosphere. It has
been theorized that the core could
then melt it's way through the foun-
dation ofthe plant. into the crust
ofthe earth. and drift about beneath
the crust spreading radiation
wherever it went. .

Such a meltdown could occur if
the primary and the Emergency Core
Cooling System were both to fail.
The important question is : How
likely is this to happen? Atomic
Energy Comission's last report
was done in l974 by Norman
Rasmussen. The Rasmussen report
claimed that the possibilities for a
catastrophic accident were
“vanishingly small.“ Many
weaknesses have been identified in
this study to date. One weakness is
that Rasmussen used a “fault tree"
analysis of probabilities that was
developed and then discredited by

l

the defense department. Another is
that human error and malice were
not taken into- account at all! The
report's accuracy can be seriously
questioned on these and other
points. The ECCS has been tested on
six semi-scale models. and failed to
operate each time. The only place
that the ECCS has worked was in
computer simulations. The uncer-
i tainty in this area alone presents a
strong case for discontinuing the use
of reactors for the present.

Nuclear fuel wastes are now being
shipped across the country by plane,
truck and ship. The most potentially
devastating accident involves the
crash of a plane. Such an accident
could distributcthe fuel or wastes for
hundreds of miles.

One cantalk about the probability
of a catastrophic accident forever
without coming to any deﬁnite con-
clusions. The best evidence for real
mistrust comes from the insurance
provisions of the companies in-
volved. When the A.E.C. was first
trying to get privateindustryintothe
nuclear field in I954. the companies
ﬂatly refused. The A. E.C estimated
that a major accident could cause
$17 billion worth of damages. After
considering this. and their own es-
timates. the companies decided that
the risk was too great. Congress
responded with the Price-Anderson
Act. This act limits the payment of
damages to $560 million. of which
$420 million would be provided by
the government. Any amount of
damages totaling over $560 million
would simply not be collected. lfthe
companies involved don‘t ﬁnd the
risks acceptable. why should the

pub ic.

The most mind boggling side to
the safety issue is that ofthe nuclear
wastes. A one thousand megawatt
reactor would of necessity produce
the long lived fission products equal
to | 1.500 megatons ofnuclear ﬁssion
bombs. If planned construction con-
tinues. we will have 500 of these
plants by the year 2000.

At the very heart of the nuclear
powerindustrylies plutonuim 239. It
is the most deadlysubstancc ever
handled in quantity by man. Dr.
Donald Gcssman. and authority on
the medical effects of plutonium. has
estimated that one pound of
plutoitttim has the potential to
produce 9 billion cases of lung
cancer. In a fully nuclear economy.
plutonium would be produced on
the order of 200.000 pounds annual-

MUSIC MADNESS
New York‘s Carnegie Hall has
banned all rock groups from‘perfor-
ming there on the grounds that rock
music is hazardous to human health.
The hall's director. Julius. Bloom.
explains that the U.S.‘s \most
prestigious concert hall consulted
health authorities last week before
reaching the controversial decision.
Said Bloom: “A rock show has a
decibel count intolerable to the
human ear. We have acted for the
safety of the audience.“

Health experts warned that any
music over the level of 105 decibels
could cause irreparable ear damage
to members of the audience.

It's interesting to note that Deep
Purple. back in 1972 in London.
reportedly set an all-time concert
noise record by performing at “7
decibels. At least three members (I

FANGPASTE

A California dentist whoinvented
the world‘s first toothpaste for
dogs—«reports that she has now
developed a whole line of dental
hygiene products for the canineset.

Dentist Ursula Dietrich—whose
beef-flavored dog toothpaste called
Doggydent sells for a hefty $2.89 a
tube——reports she has now come up
with special dog toothbrushes and

pooch polishing units' for doggie
teeth.

Dietrich has now formed a com-
pany. called Deepen Enterprises. to
distribute her product ' across
America.

Gordon Simmons. it spokesman
for Deepen Enterprises. reports that
Doggydent is completely organic.
atid the toothpaste has become so
popular that “Some people who are
allergic to people toothpaste are try-
ing it.“

Cats like it too. ltc says.

WORM CRAZE

Someone who ought to know
about such things is warningthat the
current craze to create tasty treats
and recipes out of earthworms can
be extremely hazardous to your
health.

This isthe warningfrom Bill Ross.
the owner of Circle 0 Worm
Ranches—one of the largest
Earthworm producers in the world.

Ross says his farms produce
literally millions of squirming
worms for all kinds things—Afrom
fishing bait to living garbage dis-
posal units.

However. he says. you shouldn't
simply buy worms. cook tltcm and
cut them in those exotic recipes
currently making the rounds. Ross
states that the problem with eating
worms is that the crawling creatures.
maitt diets consist of animal manure.
He warns that most humans dining
on worms are unknowingly con—
suming a diet of raw manure still
contained inside the worms‘
stomach.

DEFECTIVE DISCS

Do you ﬁnd that an awful lot of
your rock albums are of such poor
quality that often they have to be
returned?

If so. you‘re not alone. According

vinyl.‘.'.  A ,

. While most record stores ﬁnd the .'
situation aggravating since they or
generally forced to exchsnp the»
record and then return it to the dis-
tributor. it's unlikely to get any
better. The buyer for 5 record store _
in LA. says: “Ithinkifqualitycon- '
trols rose toa higher level. the cost of
improvement would drive record -
prices even higher and that would
hurt us worse than dealing with
defectives as wide now.”

Shercrtz says he fed a number of
roaches increasing amounts of a
powerful cancer-causing agent
known as “Afltitoxin”. but that none
of the insects developcdthe disease.

The researcher says the roaches‘
bodies simply secreted an unknown
substance that seemed to makethem
