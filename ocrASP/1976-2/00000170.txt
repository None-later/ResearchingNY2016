democratic and participatory

 

by Stephen Eiscnman

More than a week has now
passed since the demonstration
occurred. lts gains, though un-
likely to be substantial. have yet
to be calculated. lts effects on the
arts are therefore even more
problematical. Yet there were
definite gains; for in the confu-

,sion that ensued. much could be

learned about the role of the arts
in a free society.
After being frustrated in their
attempts to gain relief through
the violence on the capital steps,
many young men and women
began to mill around, exploring
the vast maze of buildings and
passages that comprise the
physical structure of state
government. It was a romp for
most. They bounded down un-
known hiills in unnamed
buildings, marveling at the im—
mensity of it till. They made
jokcs. expressing astonishment
humongou- structucecimd.

r Art and Politics

laughing at the futuristic nature
of their surroundings.

Their laughter was a natural
response tothe incongruityof the
situation; wet and 'harried
students marching down antisep-
tic halls. Few thought of the
serious side of their trek. For in
their frustration caused by
meeting unresponsive govern-
ment in 21100 confusing building,
there is expressed much of what
is wrong with government in—
stitutions.

Here the role of the arts begins
to assert itself. The discipline of
architecture here plays a vital
role in the expression and excr—
cisc of government power. We
see in architectural terms. both
the essence and the failure of our
democratic institutions.

The buildings that form the
Empire State Plaza. (South
Mall), like those of its uptown
SUNYA cousins. are represen-
tative of a particular kind of
modcrn architecture. The forms
are sparse and relatively un-
dccorutcd. Thcgmatcrials used,

  

steel. cement. marble and stone.
are sturdy yet ﬂexible. capable of
being molded into megalithic
structures or small sculptures.
Their expression (that is the ar-
tistic conveyance of a feeling; the
synthesis of style and subject
matter) can be understood by all.

The marchers on Albany. in
their search for the “govern-
ment”, were confused by the
massivencss and unhospitality of
the buildings. The profile of
Pearl Street is one made up of
bleak walls, and overhanging ce—
ment cliffs. The Legislative Of-
fice Building, marked by few
signs. its function hidden rather
than illuminated by its form. was

   

found only by a few. For those
few. the tunnels that connected
each of the buildings. presented a
bleak vistil of uninterrupted tile
and cement.

The passages were controlled
by hidden cameras; the fortress
like quality of the buildings was
unmistakable. The towers.
reaching up into the sky like
great fingers. are unbroken vcr-
ticals. all out of proportion to
human scale. It is formally
designated “bcaurocratic
architecture“ by those versed in
the field. Yet this term does not
tell us enough. It does not ex-
press thc peculiarly unhospitabie
character of the architecture. It
only hints at the exclusivist
nature of the forms.

The buildings express the
secretive. exclusive aspect of
government. shunning its

 

 

nature. It ishcre that ‘a study of
the arts coincides. with;
democratic government. At a
time when study of all disciplines
of the arts (painting. sculpture.
architecture. the written word) is-
being cut back. such study is
most essential. For a study of the
arts encourages f rec thinking and
intellectual growth.

Governmental architecture
should invite. not repell. Those
students that wandered through
the capital last week. will
probably not return. except
perhaps for a lark. If we are to
create a reasonable living and
working environment. an un-
derstanding of architecture and
of the expressive nature of art is
necessary. We must educate all
to be visually and culturally
litcratc.

into thcjoys ofspccd rcttding—mr rcilding

“while we wait for everyone to be scaled.

ncccssity to modern day life.
