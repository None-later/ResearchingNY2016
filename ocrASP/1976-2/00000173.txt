Fresh Air and tires

envigorating lea their name implies.
This relatively new ensemble is com-
prised of 'John Esposito playing
piano. George Kaye playing bass.
Jim Coles playing drums and Jody
Shayne with‘vocals. '

I caught them a couple weeks ago
on a Saturday night and was ex-
tremely impressed by their perfor-
mance. Beginningthe evening at 9:00
the music went on well past one
o‘clock. Fresh Air kept the audience
happy while satisfying their own
creative desires. This was achieved
with a diverse program of jazz stan-

material. all mixed toyther to ex-
tract an exciting blend of musical
sounds. Some of the pieces per-
formed were compositions by
Charles Lloyd. Ester Phillips.
Horace Silver. Judy Collins, Flora
Purim. and Bill Evans. Originals by
John Esposito were included in the

' evening‘s performance.

The group is unique because of
their reliance on purely acoustic in-
struments. The music can be heard
without electronic gimmickry and at
a listenablc level.

The Saturday night performance
was attended by a lounge full of peo-

ple. The only seat 1 could find was at

the bar. Thursday is presented as
jazz night and I was curious to see if y
it would afford me a more conducive
atmosphere.

0n the following Thursday“ i
came back. The nucleus of Fresh Air
was augmented with Sam Farkas on
guitar. Mike Van Hatten on trotti-
bone. and Brubby Taylor on congas.
Last semester. Mike was director of
the Albany State Jazz Society‘s Jazz
Ensemble. Sam is well known to all
of you who listen to his radio show
aired by WRPI on Sunday nights at
11:00. Brubby has attended SUNYA
in addition to working with

  
     

numerous bands in this area.
Following a couple of muical

numbers. the group launched into i i ;
blistering up tempo of Auriimn‘

leaves. Soloing first. Mike played

through the range of his horn. He-

was ﬂuid in his technique and his
chordal sense was impressive. Sam
proceeded with a full bodied mellow
guitar solo. He incorporated many
ideas into each of his musical
statements and displayed a relative
ease of moving back and forth

between single noted and chorded

melodies.

After they ﬁnished playing. Jody
sang. Her music was similar to last
Saturday night‘s but her solos were
expanded to a wide range of im
provisations. She demonstrated the
impressive instrumental qualities of
her viocc by scat singing (syllable
sung musical patterns). One minute
Jody would by soaring on high
crystalline notes and the next. sen-
suously eooing soft murmers.

The rhythm section formed a
tight foundation for Jody and the
other soloists. George on bass had
some excellent solos. Some bass
players would rather stick to it stan-
dard background bass line. George,
onthc other hand. reaches a stage of
improvisation where bass lines are
both lyrical and melodious. James
Coles on drums I tastefully com-
plemented the band's energy. He is a
listening musician. The rythm sec-
tion. as a whole. played well
together. lir'uhby's conga playing
could spark any hand.

If you listen closely. you‘ll hear Es-
posito coaxing Keith .larrctt‘s

The band bettered Saturday ,
night‘s performance. 'Their whole.
approach was more alive and crisp.
As they neared the end of the even- '
ing. a Miles Davis blues piece and an ‘
original composition by John Es-‘
posito with a flute solo by Chuck
Fisher were played. ,
In a later set the same evening, a
totally different collection of
musicians sat in. A group under the
direction of Hal Miller (drums).
featuring the vocals of Shirley,
Huirston. did their own interesting
interpretation of a wide range of
music from standards to the. new
music of Chick Corea. Supported by
the fine playing of David
Rossteader. (bass) and Rich Mon-
tallouno (piano). the quartet
presented a polished and tight
professional performance. All told.
it was an evening of energetic. ex-
citing music.

With such it comfortable settings
as Tht' Steak and Ale affords. you
shouldn't miss Fresh Air. To get
there. just take Central Ave. (Rt. 5)
down tothe Molnth Mulltkt. l46).
take u left and go for a few miles.
Thch is no cover charge. so you can
nurse a drink all night. (in soon—
you'll come back feeling better than
when you left.
