while still a Great Power. had long
(since passed its prime and showed
 signs of weakness. After almost-100
g years of occupation and suppression
I the Greek people were restless and

ready for rebellion. In March, of
. i821, all overithe Peloponnese. small
1 bands of Greek irregular: and ban-
dits. thefamous klephts. set uponthe
Turks. killing many and forcing the
' rest to withdraw to their fortiﬁed
garrisons. Out of theseincidents, at
-ﬁrst isolated. grew the Greek War of
independence.

‘ On March 25 ‘of l82l the

 

   

      

Metropolitan (Bishop) Germanoc ot‘
Patras in
Peloponnese. together ‘ with other:-
clerics and lay notables.'rnised the
flag of natipnai rebellion at the near-
by monastery of Aghia Lam
Visitors still can see the famous stan-
dard of the revolution at the
monastery today; even the planetree
in the shade of which the event is
supposed to have taken place still
stands. March 25 is observed by the
Greek nation as Independence Day..
Some of the most famous action
of the Greek War of Independence
took place at Missolonghi, which is

the ’ northwest

 
 
 
 

  

located on the northern shore of the
Gulf of Corinth. Lord Byron died
here on April 19. I824. When Mis-
solonghi was besieged by the Turks

22. l826. attempted an exodus. The
attempt failed. thousands were
massacred. and the city was taken.
Our illustration is a detail from a

lithograph. Exodus From Mis-
solonghi, by the Greek artist Th.
Vryzakis. The fall of Missolonghi in-
tensiﬁed pro-Greek sentiments in
Europe. Delacroix‘s painting Greece
Expiring on the Ruins of Mis-
solonglu' has captured the spirit of
these sentiments, which ultimately
helped to win Greek ' ‘ ‘

over again. then upside down, and sat
there like a grinning idiot realizing that
maybe this whole thing really works.

And just so we wouldn’t leave empty-
handed, Mr. Glaccum was going to in-
crease our reading speed in the ten or so
minutes that we had left. First, We read
‘for a minute to establish our present
speed. Mine came out to 396. about nor-
mal. Then he showed us the first of the
reading dynamics exercises, using the
foreﬁnger to rapidly underline each line

Were still reading at well above our former
levels.

They called it velocitizing in Driver‘s
Ed. Pull off the Thruway at 70 mph onto
an exit ramp at 30 mph and it‘s almost in-
tolerably slow.

The ﬁnger acts as a pacer. “ Forget what
they told you in third grad, you eye needs
something to guide it. You wouldn‘t look
up a name in a phone book without using
your ﬁnger, would you?“

We tested again. reading for a minute
with our new-found skills. 1 was now at
607 words per minute. A 50 percent in-
crease in ten minutes.

Images of Ray Walston as “My
Favorite Martian" came into my mind; he
would pull a book offashelf. flipthrough
the pages once in less than five seconds

in the book and following as quickly as
possible with our eyes, reading for zero
comprehension.

Reading dynamics, he told us, is a sim-
ple psychomotor skill that anyone can
learn. Basically. the idea is to teach your
eyes to focus not simply on one word. but
on one group of words. one paragraph.

and ultimately, one page. This ﬁrst exer-
cise accustomed our eyes to seeing words
at a very high rate of speed, so that when
we SIOWed it down our eyes appeared to
crawl across the page. even though we

and replace the book. every word un-
derstood.

I was already dreaming of the powers I
would have. I could walk into my Tolstoy
class twenty minutes early and polish off
Waramll’eace before the teacher arrived.
It was the perfect bookstore rip-off—
walk in. spend a few minutes readingthat
sociology test, then walk out, never again
spending another cent there.

But.
a lot of money. A full semester at
SUNYA, for whatever that's worth. And
I have enough trouble digging up the rent
each month.

So not entirely conﬁdent that they
wouldn't lock us in if we refused tosign up
for the course. I made sure I was one of
the ﬁrst to leave.
