Cut Astronomy Prof Gets Grant

by Jonathan Levenson

Last Week. the National Science
Foundation awarded $4.800 in
research money to the Dudley
Observatory for a study whose Pro-
ject Director is soon to be released
SUNYA Associate Professor Dr. A.
(1. Philip.

This raises the amount of grant
money received by Dudley for worlt
involving SUNYA‘ Astronomy
faculty to $l9o.800 in two weeks.
The Astronomy department itself is
slated for elimination nextsemcster.

Philip will be collaborating with
Dr. Martin MeCan hyofthe Vatican
Observatory in Italy. and Dr.
Nicholas Sanduleak of the Warner
and Swascy Observatory in
Cleveland. Ohio. The project‘stitle is
“A Deep Spectral Survey of the
Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds.“

The project will involve the
preparation of a survey ofthe most

‘luminous stars in the two galaxies

which are closest to our ownwthe
Milky Way galaxy. Studies ofthcsc
stars will yield information concer-

kept-thorn

niug galactic structure. stellarevolu—
tion. and chemical composition in
external galaxies.

When the survey is ﬁnally com-
pleted. the stars of the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds must be
catalogued. A catalogue is basically
an identification chart listing stars
by magnitude. or brightness.

. Dr. Philip‘s survey. will hopefully
yield a catalogue containingstars ap-
proximately 2'/z magnitudes (or ten
times) l'aintcrthan any previous such
listing.

Philip was pleased about the
grant. “I think it‘s great. It helps me
get my work done." He said that
receiving the grant "makes what the
university did [cutting Astronomy]
even more nonsensical."

According to Vice President for
Research Louis Salkevcr. the
Astronomy department raised less
than 530.000 in grants front I973 to
the present. However. several of the
SU NYA Astronomy professors eon-
tend that most of their research
grants were filed through the Dudley
Observatory—and were totally ig—

nored by the Presidential Task
Force. Salkevcr said that the deci-
sion to cut the masters and doctoral
programs as well as the Astronomy
major had already been made last
year.

Salkevcr indicated that arty grants
received through Dudley were out of
his purview. since he would only be

aware of grants filedthrough the un- -

iversity (technically. the Research
Foundation). Philip noted that in
the original agreement between the‘
observat’ory and the school.both the
institutions were to collaborate in
research~and that the observatory
was designated as the Astronomy
research laboratory for SUNYA. He
further claimed that the filing
procedure through Dudley was
accepted at that time as standard
operating procedure.

Students presently on ﬁle will
receive ﬁrst crack at the jobs.
Whitlock said. “Some students were
turned down for aid earlier for lack
of funds. Those who haven‘t found
other jobs and still want aid can
come in and make an appointment.“

The increase is the result of a
redistribution of federal aid which
recipient schools may not have used.
to “those presently showing need."
according to Whitlock. Whitlock
said that SUNYA had applied for

$55,000 in additional funds to cover ‘

those who needed aid. but only
received the $20,000.
