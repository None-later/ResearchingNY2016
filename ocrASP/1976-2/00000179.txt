'_ by Billy Kreuter

The Presidential Task Force on
Resources and Priorities suggested
the termination of the Environmen-
tal Studies program. because the
program was too fragmented and
diff use to provide needed specializa-
tion. According to many closeto the
program. the real reason for its end is
that.the program is an innovative
rather than a traditional one.

The Environmental Studies facul-
ty attacked the decision to terminate
in a memorandum to President
Fields February 27. .While certain of
the claims made in the memo are in
error, aninvestigation indicates that
the Task Force‘s conclusions in rela-
tion to environment are
questionable.

Staff members of the Task Force
have said that there was no time to
speak to outside consultants who
were highlyfavorabletotheenviron-
ment program. while many other
reviews were given little attention.

Because so much evidence in favor of
the program was given little weight.

have said that the Task Force. the

Senate's Educational Policies Couri-

are incompetent to judge the
program.

Scott. who is on leave of absence
this year, said the approach of the
Select Committee and the Task
Force was “naive . . . They don‘t
understand the nature of a multi-
disciplinary program." he claimed.
saying that they had wrongly con-
sidered it on the same basis as every
other department.

The Task Force members
themselves could offer little insight
on their decision to terminate the
program. However, Ira Birnbaum.
former Student Association Vice
President and the sole student
member oI‘the task force, said he had
opposed the decision to terminate all
along. He said he tried to convince
his colleagues that Environmental
Studies was a highly promising
program that should have been
slated for an increase.

[the Task Force majority] felt it

Scott and Nichols point out that
although the Task Force claimed it
judged all programs on the basis of
five criteria (program quality, cen-
trality. potential for addressing
public policy. demand and cost). it
only took a narrowly-defined view of
"centrality" into consideration. The
February memo included an im-

Task Force‘s judgment was not
justified because. despite all this
favorable data. the Task Force had
still found that the program was un-
desirable.

The ISI’C assumed all the evidence
