As the Pure Prairie League concert rolled on down
the line Saturday night. the feeling came that one was
watching the sequel to the Frank Zappa collection.
Anieri‘ka Drinks and Gear Home. The play had satirized
the ‘605 hippies scene. The concert scented a walking
parody ofthc‘705 dominant rock iiitisic form: “Southern
California-style" countryrock.

At the very start. the pedal steel blasted oiit the sound
of a train whistle. atid near the end. the country-
acccnted singer said that the audiettce Iiad better stomp
in time to the next song. "or the hand‘ll come out illlti
stomp on you." (Yec~|iah!) Cowboy hats aboundcd. as
did the three-part harmonies. Il/‘i/l I/lt' (TIT/1' [Jr
UII/Tl’U/t‘l'lt was the perfunctory encore and some bllllju
and dohro were thrown in l'or'good measure.

I’l’L successfully fulfilled the fornitila for current
country rock music. All their music was well receith h_\
the sweltering ballroom audience. who gave. as custom.
standing ovations prior to both eiicorcs. In particular.
the hits Amy and Tim Lune IIig/iirrrr. \teie predictably
performed and appreciated.

Oh. how predictable! There would be it four iiiitiiitc
rocker with a ripping lead guitar and some good pedal
steel, thenthcre would bet: four. . .

the mysticism in his other songs.
