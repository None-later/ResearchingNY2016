Bill Bartholorna'e will head. up the .

the second midfield. “Kevin has

Fowler. Torn Cerra completes the
third midﬁeld. ‘

“Although Tom has been our
swingman between attack and mid-
ﬁeld so far. he will probably see ac-
tion as a midfielder." said Fowler.
“Tom should add stability to the se-
cond midﬁeld and the fact that he
can shoot both left and right handed
is a big plus."

Fowler. ‘He‘ wants it badly and is

Dave Ahonen will be the third
starting defenseman. “Dave has
great speed and plays good solid
defense. His speed creates fast break
opportunities."

Gil Mllon will see plenty of action
as the fourth defenseman. according
to Coach Fowler‘s plans. “Gil is a

his lack'of foot speed outside the '

. up——is‘a fine goalie. He is still'lear-
ning and must improve his
footwork.

“Looking at the team on the
whole. I think the key to our season
will be the development of the mid-
ﬁelders. In addition. we can't afford
any injuries especially‘at the midfield
or attack position. The defense
should be tough and if we can just
control the loose ball and put it into
the cage we should be winners." said
the coach.

Oswego April 7

Looking at the schedule. the
Danes open at Oswcgo April 7. Last
year they defeated the Great Lakers
17-3. The Danes open their home
season against Hamilton April 10
before traveling to Brockport for a
big game against the Golden Eagles.
Brockport was the ECAC upstate
champion last year and Fowler is
looking forward to it.
