Stickmenz‘Vastly Improved’

by Craig Bell

The I976 Lacrosse season opens
April 7. and according to assistant
coach Bill Fowler. the team should
be vastly improved over last year's
squad.

“I'd be truly disappointed.“ said
Fowler. “if we don't finish better
than last year‘s 6-6 mark." Fowler
says this in light of the fact that
graduation has radically depleted his
corps.

“It is true that graduation has hurt
us." he said. “We lost it number of
leaders and this leaves us with a great
void to fill. But we still haven few
solid veterans returning and they
should form the nucleus of a solid
club. We are a young team but our
goal is still to make the playoffs."

Co-captain Terry Brady will head

the attack for Albany. The senior
from Long island plays behind and
will control the ball for most of the
game. awarding to Fowler. Brady
can go both left and right with little
problem and was last year's leading
scorer (9 goals. 22 assists).

Bill Scbmol. a freshman from El-
mont. has been a pleasant surprise.
according to Fowler. "He will be
playing the crease and we expect ll
lot of help from him.“

The third spot for now belongs to
Don McCue. up from last year's
junior varsity team. The 6foot 4incli
McCue has an excellent shot but has
to work on his stick, iiccordingto the
coach. “His development is the key
as to whether the attackgclls into a
cohesive unit." he explained.

The midfield. the heart of every
good lacrosse team. will either make
or breakthis team. “The key to the
whole season," said Fowler “is the
the development of their till-round
play}.

Jny Kianka is the Diines‘ leading
midﬁelder. “He does everything
well." said Fowler. "and in addition
he has excellent lacrosse sense. He
always knows what's happening out
there."

Aaron Berg will be alongside
Kianka on the first midfield.“Aaron

Occupy Pi'e'sid'ent’sv Office

by .loAnne S. Andrews

A delegation of about twenty ‘
l’ucrto Rican students took over the
office of SUNYA President Emmett
Fields for four hours yesterday.
demanding the return of the fourth
faculty line which was cut from next
years educational budget.

The students told Fields they
would not leave his office until he
gave them it commitment to return
the line cut. Fields told the students
that he did not have the authority to
make such ii commitment. He said
that the state legislature determines
liowtlic educational monies arcto be
allocated.

The students left Fields' ofﬁce at
dusk. iiftcr Dean of Student Affairs
Brown read the students the rights of
Public Order.

A student said that they spoke
with it state Senator last Tuesday.
The legislator has reportedly
promised he would do what he could

to help them.

One graduate student of Prime
Rican Studies said. “Our education
should not be left solely for the
legislature to‘decide." she went on to
say that the Pucrto Rican students
wanted a commitment f romthis Un-
iversity's Administration. not the
legislature. for the return of the
fourth line. Fields responded to this.
“You can say that and say it again.
but you‘re not goingto get thcfourth
line because we don't have it."

One of the students told Fields
that ii department cannot function
with only three professors. and this
cut-buck was an act of
“institutionalized racism." Fields
denied this. tcllingthc students that
the criteria for determining the cut-
backs is by the number of students
enrolled in a given department.

The protestors replied. “We don‘t
want to play your numbers game.“
They said. “This is a new depart-

Senator John Marchi and
Assemblyman Louis DiSalvo.

“We were under the impression
that the Italian program was cut

is Speaker Pro-'l‘emp. “We sort of
resented that." he added. pointing
out that it wasthe onlylanguage cut.

" | hey recogni/cd that enrollment
was low." said Fields. adding that
they did bring data about an in-
creased pcrccntiigc of high school
students taking Italian. “It had some
meaning. but not enough.“ he said.

Fields approved the Task Force

recommendation that the Italian
program be cut because of low
enrollment. high cost per completed
credit. and because Italian programs
are offered at many schools in the
state.

The Italian MA. and BA.
programs cost SI H.000 at present.
The chapters amendment adds
5150.000.

Louis Iioiiaffini. from SUNYA‘s
Italian department. explained that
Italian “is very central to the
Humanities. The Western World
would have ' taken a very different
turn without the Italian
Renaissance.“ He also pointed out
that 32 percent of the tri-city area is
of Italian descent. and thus the
department fulfills a community
need.

Funds May Be Lost In Space

by Jonathan Levenson

A community fund. collected in
I959 to help pay part of the cost of
building a planetarium on the
SU NYA campus. has been lying dor-
mum in an Albany savings bank.
The fund. trustccd utider Mayor
Erastus Corning. has been collecting
interest and is now valued between
$70-$80.000.

The Henry Hudson Planetarium.
as it was to have been named. would
probably have been built near the In-
firmary. HoWever. the lowest bid
received from contractors for the
facility was approximately $l.200.-

SUNYA Recreation Center Close

by Paul Roscnthul

SlJNYA‘s proposed field house or

"bubble" recreation center is draw—
ing closer to reality. as SA lenders
complete their research on the pro-
icct.
V ('ciitriil Council recently up~
proprinted $|.00t) from the Athletic
Advisory Board surplus to support
preliminary work for the recreation
facility. included in the research
have been investigations of existing
structures and a survey of needs and
interests on this campus.

A field Iiousc for intercollegiate
sports was included in the master
construction plans for the campus.

SA Vice President Rick Meckler.
a chief proponent of the planned
facility. has performed much of the
necessary advance work. Under the

supervision of Associate Dean for
Student Affairs Robert Squtitrigliti.
Mecklcr has visited two existing
recreation centers. Also involved in
the research liiivc been Athletics
Director Joseph Garcia and Student
Activities Advisor Dennis Elkin.
Student leaders stress that the
facility will be used primarily for in-
formal student activities. SA Con-
troller Stu Klein said. “Its primary
purpose would be for student use.
not for intercollegiate sports or
physical education classes. Klein
complained of tlielack of easy access
to facilities at the University Gym.
Two options exist for the propos-
ed center. A "bubble." similar to one
constructed at SUNY Buffalo. is the
less expensive proposal. More costly
would be a complex like the one

erected at Boston College. which in-
cludes six basketball/tennis courts.

Mcckler believes the "bubble"
alternative hits some merit. "The nice
tliingiibout it waistlitit it was sort ofii
tottil recreational package." he said.
He siiid Buffalo rented the structure
for $50,000 a year.

Meckler said. “If we couldn't get
more money. we would consider a
bubble."

Concert Use

Although more costly. a facility
similar to the one built at Boston is
more likely. according to Meckler.
He estimated the center Would cost
about $2 million. Included in the
structure would be multiple-purpose
courts and an indoor track. The
center would also be used for con-
certs.

Astronomy Department. says the
difference was closer to “530.000. by
our accounting."

Before the project was stalled. in
the mid-sixties. the university had
already committed itself to purchase
a pltincttiriuni projector. A contract.
which was signed with the Carl Zeiss
Co. of West Germany has cost New
York State 575.000 thus far. . . the
remaining portion of the bill (about
550.000) was never paid. causing it
breach of contract. With no money
available to pay the balance. the
original 575.000 may be totallylost.

According to Vice President for
Management and Planning John
lliirtlcy. he has been involved in
negotiations for the last four years in
It" attempt to have the SUNY pay-
ment refunded. These negotiations

To Reality

Predictions as to wltercthc money
would come from mention various
alternatives. Klein said. “There are a
nitnibcr of possible sources. in-
cluding the possibility of a usage
fee." A voluntary line might be [iith-
cd on tuition bills in order to defray
the costs of the project.

Mccklcr agrees with the concept
of voluntary payments to support
the center. He said. “You offer
everything in one gym and you sell it
for a usage fee." He noted that while
there are funds at SUNYA forinitial
capital. Boston completed the pro-
jcct successfully with no money to
start with.

Other revenues might become
available through state and federal
agencies. Meckicr said. Rental fees

continued on page four

are still up in tlic liir. and ii refund
would be contingent upon the pro-

jector being sold to some other in-

stitution.

When asked about the ap-
proximate si/c of this potential rc-
l'und. Ilartlcy quoted the lttsl Zciss
