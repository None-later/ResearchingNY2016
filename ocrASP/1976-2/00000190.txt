said. “Basically. it means that. yotm
pretty together dude. I'll tell. you
something. though. Hy—l know people
who are supposedly workingtheir way up .
to successful professional careers. and
you‘d think that they'd have their shit 8

yourself. But some ofthem are so hung up

in class who tell me everything that‘s go- “I‘ll tell you something. Jackson. This

“What‘s your major?“ I asked. But you know what? You can‘t lctil get

“E-Ilat.“ he said. I gave hima look. “No you down. because you gotta realize that
actually if you really want to know. I m
studying to be u Drum Major. I originally
wanted to go into cab driving. but the
field is really getting overcrowded with
college grads these days.“

"When was the last time you were ever
serious. Hy?“

“thn I took my drivingtcst in 1972.
You know how those inspectors urc - no
sense of humor wlmtsucver."

“But don‘t you ever get borcd. just sit-
ting around doing nothing all day?" | ask-
cd him after he started his second bccr.

“Arc you kidding? Why should I get
bored sitting in the sun. shootin‘ the shit
with my friends. and getting high. First of
all. what else would I be doing“

'Wcll . . . don’t you have a job?
Don't you have to work sometimes?"

“As Ray Davies ofthc Kinks has said.
‘who needs a job when it‘s sunny?‘ “

“But tell me. Hy. What else do you like
about hanging out?“

“What else do I like . . . well. it
doesn't cost any money. for one. It also
doesn‘t pollute the environment. so it's an
ecological and patriotic thing to do.l It
certainly doesn’t hurt anybody. And you
get to meet all kinds ofintercsting people.
especially girls. But most of all. it gives
one a sense of fulfillment. a sense of
spiritual. inner peace and self con-
fidcncc.“

“I don‘t understand. How can you get
all this from doing nothing?‘

“Well, most days you just hang out.
you know? But on certain rurc days. when
the wcnthcr‘sjust right. when you‘re with
your favorite people. and when you're in
just the right mood. all these elements
combine into the perfect hang. I mean
hanging‘s always good. you know. but
there‘s times when it's really good. Those
are the days that a true connoisseur of
hangingloose lives for. Ifyou‘vc never cx-
pcrienccd it for yourself. you can‘t

possibly know what it‘s like. It‘s so great
tojust lay back and enjoy the feeling. and
all thcthlngs you usually worry aboutjust
get pushed out of your thoughts totally.
Yeah. nothing beats a perfect hang!“

After this Inst statement. Hieronymus
was silcnt, sturing off into space with a
tutnlly hcntific expression on his face.

You could sec 1 Itth this was at man who felt

he had found truc fulfillment in his life.

After nbuut 21 minute of dccp contempla-

tion. Hieronymus broke off his rcvcric by

npcning up bccr number three.
“You know. Hieronymus." l ﬁllltI. "You

may be the only sclf—nctunlizing pcrson I

know.“

"Well. I don‘t know what that menus.
but It sounds like somethingu Psych mu-
jur would suy. all right!"

It‘sjust part ofthc deal. I mean. that's the
way it's always been and that's the way it
always will be. So remember—when
nothing in the world seems to make any
sense. a sense of humor is your best
defense. You gotta take everything that
happens to you with a grain of salt. So if
you can laugh at all the screwed-upthings
that happen in the world and enjoy all the
good shit. then you‘ll have absolutely
nothing to worry about.“
“Well. Hieronymus. I havctobcgoing
now. I must say it‘s been a real pleasure
talking to you. and I hope my readers can
dig what you have to say. Keep hangin'
loose. buddy." I said.
“Thut I must assuredly will. my man.
Make sure you keep hungin‘ loose
yourself. Take it slow!"
I started to leave. but IIS l was walking
he stopped me In my tracks. He looked at
me with thut smile of his and snid:
"By the way. are you doing unythlng
tonight? I feel like playing some Bi- Plttnc
down at Suttcr's“.
"A dollar at game?“ I asked.
“You guessed it.“
“I‘ll be them!“ And I wnlked awuysmil-
lug into the rust of the afternoon. '

 

"Nothing gets past you. does it, My?" 1
