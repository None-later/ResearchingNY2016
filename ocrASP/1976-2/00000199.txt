Ken Kenya asylumin‘fone Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest” is a mechaiticillyveontrolled institution that seeks

m giggly pmentalitc the individtial. Inmates are
stripped of their manhood by Ratched. the Big Nurse
who is coldly threatening in spite of her earth-mother
appearance. Kescy‘s asylum is feared because. whether
insane or not. all are treated as insane: the patient is
insane because he's in an asylum, and in an asylum
because he’s insane. There‘s no cure. no rehabilitation,
just perpetuation ofthe myth.

The myth surrounding insanity does not allow for a
total cure. There's always t he possibility of a relapse, the
unpredictability of flying off the handle at any given
moment. Once in. there‘s no way out.

And it is this atmosphere that the film so accurately
captures. Director Milor Forman adds a claustrophobic
tinge to the asylum scenes through the use of close-ups
and by shooting. as often as possible. through doors,
glass windows. wire fencing—the confining barriers of
the institution.

More often than not. these barriers are symbolic
rather than physical. The sliding glass panel and the
small swinging door are no more capable of restraining
the patients than a white chalk line on the ﬂoor. it is the
threat of the institution that conﬁnes them. the
overwhelming power that is channeled to thcmthrnugh
iii g Nurse.

Louise Fletcher gives a subtle performance as Nurse
Ratched—calm. cool, and very calculating. Again. her
threat is not physical. She controls their lives. from the
amount of sleep they get to how many cigarettes a week
they can smoke. Her power is in the sharp edge of her

   
 

voice.

lint all this is background. The power struggle
between individuals is more important as a contest
between the forces of good and evil. On one level.
“Cuckoo‘s Nest“ is a morality fable. and as such its
symbols stand out from its Characters.
