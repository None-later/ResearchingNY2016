Volleyball Clubs on the Brink ‘

by DIH'ld Levy

Qucstioii I: What team sported
Albany State's best fall record'.’ No.
not malt jongg. women's volleyball.

Question 2: What team posted the
Winter‘s best inark'.’ Nasal on wrestl—
ing. ll was men‘s volleyball.

There is a technicality. though. for
these "learns" are actually “clubs.”
and cannot achieve team status until
after four years of competition.

The most impressive aspect ofthc
volleyball program's success is its
youth. lltey rolled up a 20 2 com-
bined won-lost record in only their
first season.

llntortunately. each is in danger
of folding because of lack of interest
or misunderstanding.

" loo many kidsthinkjast because
it's intercollegiate. they couldn't
make the team." said Captain .ludy
l.L'll\l\iIllt‘Il. "Most of the girls.
tlioagli. had no experience beyond

intramurals.“

Men‘s Captain Dwight Buck
agreed. “It‘s really loose. not high-
pressure. We‘re all learningthe game
basically from scratch."

Doing the teaching has been led
Earl. coach. and Jamie Miithirlitnd.
player.

“Jamie's taught us so much just
playing with us.“ said Buck. “We‘ll
miss him next year.“

Mac Farland has been called
“Olympic material" by Ear|.who was
also complimented by the players.
“'l‘cd‘s really dedicated. He'd do
anything for volleyball." one player
remarked.

Lack of Interest

Anot her reason for a seeming lack
of student interest may be the
prevalent belief that volleyball is a
pit-pat-on-the-beach-with-the-gang-
sport. “Real athletes.“ in other
words. play “real sports.“

"People who happen to catch as
practice for a few minutes raise their
eyebrowns when .lamic or Patrick
[Dwyer] put a couple on the floor."
said Chuck Durgin. ,

“Some kids told us they‘s rathe
watch us than the basketball team."
addcd l.eikkanen.

'l‘lteti. winning is fun.

Increased Exposure

The clubs have several things
planned to increase their exposure.
A demonstration at activities day
and a clinic involving sometop com-
pctilioii arc in'the works. Women‘s
tryouts will begin the first week of
the fall semester. Posters will in-
dicate time and place.

Also. if you want to catch some
fine volleyball. Union College is
hosting the Nationals this year. a
tournament that attracts the coun-
try‘s top players. It's scheduled for
May. during linals week.
