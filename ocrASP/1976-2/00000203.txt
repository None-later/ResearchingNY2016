Ruggers Cop First Two Matches

by Elliot Sulsky

The Albany Rugby Club is look-
ing forward to its most successful
season to date after winning its
opener IO-O against SUNY champ
Brockport. last week.‘

The game was marked by the
pouring rain. a muddy iicld'. arid 30
mph winds. This made the ball hard

' to handle, forcing Albany to come?
out kicking The strategy paid off
just 5 minutes into the game when a
series of kicks brought Albanydown
to Brockpnrt's 2 yard line. Albany‘s
scrum won the ball at the 2. and
Chuck Rappazzo carried it in forthe
score.

Following Brockport’s kickoff.
Albany again brought the ball into
lirockport territory. A Brocltpon
penalty gave Albany time to set up a

serum run to lorward Wences
Rodriguez. who carded the game's
second score. Bob Goldberg‘s
succeeding conversion capped the
scoring.

'i‘Itc Rugby Club made it two in a
row Saturday. rolling over St. Johns
24 0. At the game's opening it look-
ed like it Would be a long day for
State. St. John‘s well-placed opening
kick-off bounced out of bounds live
yards from the State goal line.

For the first 20 minutes. Albany
was unable to get the ball out of its
own tone. but St. John failed to
score. When State forward Kurt
Zorn was forced out of the game
with a shoulder injury. and Albany
had to play one man down for the
rest of the match. the situation look:
ed bleak.

liut finally. after the prolonged
goal line stand. Albany got its big
break. A big puttt got the ball out of
State‘s territory. Back‘ George
l.ultrs followed the ball down. got
off another kick and followed it
down again for a big score.

From that point on it was all
Statc. Outstanding scrum pursuit led
to a Chuck ltappauo score at the
end of the italf. Doug Saba and Jor-
datt Josephson both carded second
Italf scores. Elliot Susky‘s conver-
sion after all four scores made the
final tally 24-~-0.*

be difﬁcult to cut any more. “This is

Nobody has proven to be really out-

Burlingamc explains that right
now. he is playing what he terms “a
waiting game. Everybody will he get-

"I guess you could say We're in a

Intolerance In Mid East ’

by Ed Mom

Abba Eban attacked what ‘he
termed "monolithic" Arab
nationalism‘s denial of Israel‘s right
to exist. and called for a new
diplomatic peace initiative in the
Middle East. in a well-received dis-
play of oratory held here inthe gym
last Sunday.

The former Israeli Foreign
Minister and Ambassador to the
U.N. said the Arub~lsraeli dispute
differed from all others in that one
side “deities tltc very legitimacy" of
tltc other to exist as a sovereign
power.

“The Arabs do not see the Middle
East as “a tapestry of many t breads."
said Eban. but as a place where
“anything not Arab is . . . dcstittcd
one day to be covered up by the shif-
ting dcsert sands.“

As proof of what he sees as this
monolithic intolerance. Eban cited
the problems of the Kurds in Iraq.
the Christians in Lebanon. and. of
course. the Jews in Palestine.

Eban expressed amazement that
with [45 nations in the U.N. General
Assembly's—ﬁat least that was the
number when I left New York this
afternoon-«there is no Israel in
history. according to the U.N.“

“Nations whose names do not
resound anywhere [in history] are all
admitted to." Eban conti nucd saying
that the U.N. “cannot accept . . . the
older roots of our nationhood.“

He equated as anti-Zionist'and
anti-Semitic the. notion that “Every

_ nation has a right to its own domain.

. . unless it happensto be a Jewish
domain.“

0n the other hand. Eban said.
Arabs have recognition and power
out of proportion totheir numbers.

“No other people has ever received
with such little sacrifice so much
abundance . . . 3% of mankind has
l7%oftltc U.N. votes. ISOitofthein-
habitcd land surface... and by I980.
70% of the world's ttncmploycd
currency reserves . . . Yet they pre-
sent themselves as the underdogs . .

Eban admitted his countrymen
“are obsessive about our security."
How could it be any different. asked
the speaker. as lsracl “is tltc only
state brooding over 6 million of its
people killed. . . isthe onlystatcthat
hasn‘t known a single month of
peace in its national history."

Eban said several factors are
working in favor of Middle Eastern
peace. He noted the strong"mutual
self—interest" of lsracl and Egypt
towards an end of war: “With a
million new mouths to feed caclt year

Egypt cannot keep a large
military at the same time.“

Eban praised the Egyptian break
with the Soviet Union. a country
whose arms transfusions into the
Arab states Eban blamed for the
wars of I956. I967 and October.

Former, Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban speaking to otudontl In the gym Saturday night.

1973.

Ebatt said ltc hoped Egypt would
become increasingly tied to the
West. and in consequence the
chances that it will try to destroy
Israel will lessen.

Eban went onto describetltc Mid-
dle East as a “double circle of ten-
sion" where great power fears of
nuclear warthankfully put a leash on
the escalation of Arab-Israeli strife.
The lecturer urged that the "Middle
East be . . . the testing ground of
dctente.“ Eban added. however.that
‘detente‘ was an "elusive term. like
any term which can only be ex-
pressed in French."

Yet Eban does feel that progress
toward peace was at least partially

blocked by attitudes shaped in the
October war.

“Everyone remembers how the
war began." he said. “veryfew howit
ended.“ Eban said the Arabs i'CCnil
only the exuberance of their initial
successes. “while the Israeli mind is
obsessed by the first 3 days of
failure" in a war where Israel even—
tually canto within hours of bagging
the Egyptian Sinai army.

Eban feels this rise of Arab con-
fidence helped lead to the U.N.

‘ battles of world opinion in recent

years. where Israel and its allies
found themselves outvoted on
General Assembly issues.

Eban sees this “parliamentary”
and "statistical defeat of [Israelr‘ as

New Buses Replace Green Ones

Due to a limited budget and a

attd l’lannittg John Hartley at-
tributed the changeover in service to
problems in maintaining .t tight
schedule.

WI'ltcrc is less of a budget to work
with this year because of the run to

of qualiﬁed drivers. Due to the

SUNYA drivers who worked on
the weekends were put on for
weekdays to cover for drivers who
had to take off for one reason or
another. and the Yankee Trails
husscs were hired for the weekend
schedule." Hartley said.

The Yankee Trails basses also
make regular express runs on the
weekdays between the hours of seven
and nine am. and four to five-thirty

_ Hartley said that for the three
weeks the weekend charter service
has been in effect it has proven
cheaper and easier than operating
the SUNYA busscs.

Though enthusiastic about the
new weekend service. Hartley stress-
ed that it is as yet by no means a per-
manent operation.

"I want to emphasize that this is
experimental. We need to give the
(SUNYA) drivers some rest. they
work overtime as it is on weekdays

how pressed they (the drivers) have
been to maintain the schedule." he

say photocopying should be licens-

The fact that the arguments of
both groups have been incorporated
ittto the bill opctts uptltclcgal ques-
tion of where to draw the line
between “free use“ and prohibition
of “systematic reproduction."

Educators and librarians claim
that since the bill does not exactly
spell out what they are allowed to
reproduce. they will be forced to cur-
tail inter-lihrary loans of
photocopied material. for fear of a
publisher's lawsuit.

M.E. (ircnandcr. a SUNYA
English professor. feels that if the
new bill is passed. “research will
simply grind to a halt." He said that
this would be especially true iii the
case of smaller colleges. who would

Palestinian Protests

During the question period a
young woman approached the
microphone and in a voice quivering
with emotion identiﬁed herself as
someone who was proud to be a
Palestinian.

She told Eban that his speech was
all Israeli propaganda and spoke in
emotional outbursts throughout any
of lEhan‘s attempts at rebuttal. She
was led away by someone from

the event. As she was being guided
