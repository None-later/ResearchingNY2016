More than a few heads bobbed
last spring during University ol
Alabama professor Louis William‘s
biology exam when students came
across a question which asked:

“Which of the following com-
munities multiplies most rapidly: (A)
Rodents (B) Rabbits (C) Negroes
(D) Benthos (E) Plankton?"

Although Williams later told The
Washington Post that "it was a
biological question . . . and was not
intended to imply prejudice.“ his
black students felt otherwise and two
of them complained to the univer-
sity‘s academic vice president.

The vice president claims he took
the complaint as general criticism
and in turn reminded his underlings
to promote more understanding
towards campus minorities. Thetwo
complaining students feel their
grievance was ignored.

The incident. which black
students say illustrates what theycall
Alabama‘s “institutional racism.“
which they say pervades the campus.
has come to light recently with the

dent David Mathews to President

Ford's cabinet as Secretary at
Health. Education and Welfare
(HEW).

As secretary of the monster agen-
cy with its l30.000 employees and
over $120 billion in programs.
Mathews will have to grapple with.
among other things. the smoldering
question of'college desegregation. It
is a hot campus issue, especially in
the south. even a decade after the
passage of the I964 Civil Rights Act.
which forbids racial discrimination
in institutions receiving federal
funds.

Currently. HEW is closely
monitoring desegregation activities
at colleges in lo southern states
following a successful NAACP
federal suit that claimed HEW was
dragging its feet on desegregation ef-
forts.

The court ordered HEWto clamp
down onthc southern colleges. many
of which were historically all-black
o'r all-white schools. by June. I974.

\ There 5 a difference!!!

Today. HEW officials say
desegregation progress is being
made although some colleges as Well
as some state governors ure bulking
at HEW‘s proposals. As HEW chief.
Mathews will have to decide how
much pressure to apply on them to
force compliance.
Political Tightrope

Mathews will have to walk a tight
political tightrope. however. as Ford
administration politicos are worried
about the president‘s image among
conservatives in an election year. es-
pecially in the south.

"Tire issue is quite live over at
HEW right now." says NAACP at-
torney John Silard. who recently
returned to Washington District
court to ask that the desegregation
plans of eight of the southern states
be thrown out. The NAACP con-
tends the plans. the ones HEW ap-
proved in June of I974. are inade-
quate and are not being followed
anyway.

With vacation time fast approaching,
many of you will no doubt be traveling
to Mexico. Some of you might even be
coming back. Here are some helpful
hints.

1. A man on a burro always has the
right of way, unless he appears to be
a weakling.

2. In local cantinas, pouring a shot of
Cuervo down a man’s collar is not
thought to be humorous.

3. Falling onto a cactus, even an
actual Cuervo cactus, can be
a sticky proposition.

4. It is tough to find hamburger
rolls in the smaller towns; it’s
best to bring your own.

Alabama Governor George-
Wallace says he works hard for the
middle class and the pear. From
coast to coast. he declares his
allegiance to Americans being
stepped on by big business. imper-
sonal government and do-nothing
politicians.

Wallace feels he can do for
America what he has done for
Alabama. .

An examination of Wallace‘s
record. however. shows a miserable
all talk and no show state perfor-
mance. The country will be in trou-
ble if the Democratic presidential
contender is elected to rule the White
House. the Alabama Political
Research Group predicted in a newly
released pamphlet.

The organization is not composed
of New York left wingers or Harvard
radicals but native Alabamians
studying law at the University of
Alabama that grew up during the
Wallace rise and reign. Their ﬁn-
dings were published in The
Alabama Message: A View From
Within.

To ﬁnance bigger state payrolls.
Wallace relied most heavily on

Wallace can truthfully- claim that
the overall level of taxation in
Alabama is low the report said. But
the burden of taxation is on the poor
and working class. the groups the
governor is so fond of saying he
sticks up for. extremely
regressive. A tax structure is
regressive when the effective tax
rate. the actual tax payment as a

tax breaks under the Wallace ad-
ministration. the report said. The
Alabama corporations are taxed at a
flat rate of five per cent. “This means
the struggling small businessman is
taxed at the same rate as the gigantic
corporations like US. Steel and
Mobil Oil. both with large holdings
in the state.“

The rich also benefit from a
lenient estate tax and no inheritance
or gift taxes. the report said.

Wallace has been no savior forthe
working people. the law students

declared: “As a labor supporter. .

Wallace's poor posture is second to
none."

He has fought against several bills
that would encourage unions and
collective bargaining. State workers
do not have the right to collective
bargaining and are denied the right
to strike. Alabama is also one ofthe
only l9 states that does not have a

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

presidential candidates have been
granted the protection of the Federal
agency. For some unexplained
reason. all of the agents wore asmall
circular medallion on their left lapel.
Although probably used to it. the
men did not like being so carefully
observed.

Shortly after some noise was
heard from the back of the chapel.
one agent looked across the stage to
another and spoke quietly into the
medallion on the cuff of his shirt.

Jimmy Carter spoke about
America. energy. taxes. unemploy-
ment. and God. His Union College
supporters didn‘t really care what he
talked about. They would have
cheered for anything.

After telling Carter that he had
enough time for "one more ques-
tion”. the campaign people readied
themselves for the return ﬂight to
New York City.

The press prepared to phone in
their stories.

The Secret Service men cleared
the exit route—like they've done for
the past four months “like they
might do for the next four years.

"Don‘t forget to vote Tuesday."
Carter closed. Again the crowd
cheered. Although very much used
to the situation. the candidate flash-
ed that grin once more. Another
campaign appearance had ended a
hllCCL‘SS.
