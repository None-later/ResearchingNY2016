All other .IS'I' courses (except Independent Study) are

Crewisluclty. in that Washington
is about the only area that has a
specific law prohibiting hiring dis-
crimination based on sexual
preference. In some states, sexual
behavior associated with homosex-
uality is still a felony.

Cray professors have few outlets.
Other than the courts, through which
to fight discrimination. The major
teacher unions. which help bargain

do little to insure that gay professors
are protected from hiring dis-
crimination. even though they have
all taken stands condemningsuch

two schools. Long Island University
and Pratt Institute—both private
schools—have contract provisions
protecting people from discrimina-
tion due to sexual preference. Some
faculties may want such provisions

HIOCLIP CURE ,_:

A British medical research team
has enlisted 20 volunteers in a crash
effort to find a cure for one of life's
most mysterious ditches—the hie-
cups.

Doctor Jeremy Henderson. the
leader of the project. reports that the
medical team is analyzing more than
3000 possible cures for the hiccups.
many of them mailed in by helpful
citizens around the world.

The San Francisco Chronicle
reports that most of the solutions
were submitted to the team follow-
ing the tragic death of a German
plumber named Heinz Iscckc. Iscckc
developed a severe case of hiccups

several years ago. and reportedly
became so despondent ubout hic-
cuping day and night that he finally
cotnmittcd suicide in despair.

Cases of the hiccups are being in-
duced in the 20 volunteers. and
possi blc cures are then administered.
So far. according to Henderson. no
fool-proof cure has been discovered.
although rolling naked inthc snow is
one of the better. the doctor says.

The world hiccup record holder.
incidentally. is Jack O'Ieary of
California. who reportedly hiccupcd
loo million times over an eight year
period. ()‘leary credits his eventual
cure» not to drugs- but simply

 

 

prayingto St. Jitde.th‘e Patron-Saint
of hopeless causes.
O‘Leary says of the disease:

“Those eight years of torment were 7

almost worththe wonderful moment
when I stopped hiccuping." '

TERROR SPEED

An Australian swimmer says he
intends to win a gold medal at the
Montreal Olympic Games in July by
literally frightening himself into go-
ing fttster.

Steve Holland. who holds the
world's'rccord in the men's BOO-and
I500-mcter freestyle events. says he
has been smashing swim records by
imagining he was being chased by a
monster shark.

Holland has dubbed his fast
stroke method “Terror Speed“. He
says he got the idea while watching
fish in an aquarium suddenly change
speeds and start swimming faster
when they became frightened.

HOLY CANNIBIS

The U.S. Supreme Court has been
asked to decide if the constitutional
guarantee of “Freedom of Religion"
means that marijuana can be legally
used as :1 “Hon Sacrament.“

The high court is being asked to
settle a case involving Tcncssce‘s
.church of plenty where four
mcmbers were busted after smoking
pot during a religious service.

In a brief to the high court. the
churc It alleges that marijuana
“Opens you up and leaves you com-
passionate. which then allows youto
be telepathic." The California
Supreme Court has previously ruled

that peyote  a Iton sacrament at

certain American . Indian
ceremonies.

DUMBDINOS

A British botany professor states
that dinosaurs are etttinct today
mainly because they had very poor
taste. '

Plant expert Tony Swain saysthat
new ﬁndings indicate dinosaurs had
almost no taste buds. and therefore
couldn‘t tell when they were eating
poisonous plants. Swain says that
poisonous plants evolved on the
earth about the time the big reptiles
disappeared. He adds that many
dinosaur skeletons are found in con-
torted positions indicatingthey died
from a painful-stomach poison.

MUSICAL HEAD

Jim Collins has a natural head for
music.

Unlike most people. however.
Collins plays his music by pounding
u nine-inch wrench against his head.

The British Air Force officer says
he discovered his unusual talent
when he banged his head into

It was the ﬁrst time. he says. that his
head produced a clear musical note.

Collins claims he can hang out

tian Soldiers“ with the best ofthem.
Says Collins: “People who hear me
think I need to have my head ex-
amined. but I don‘t even get a
headache after a musical session.“
