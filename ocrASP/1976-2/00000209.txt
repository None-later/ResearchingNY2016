fmr‘mnu." a performance by
V'SUNYA‘s very own modern‘dance
r gtoup, provided reassuring evidence
‘tliat'modern' dance is still very much
alive and cared about on this cant-
pus. The performance. which was
presented on April 2and 3 inthe Lab
Theatre of the PAC. wasthe product
of much dedication and energy on
the part of the SUNYA students who
make up the group. and it displayed
a great deal of variay interms of the
forms used and the ideas presented.

The ﬁrst half of the program con-
sisted of a series of dances

choreoyaphed by students in the
' group. which ranged in quality from
highly struaured and formalized. as
in the ﬁrst dance. to the highlyspon-
taneous quality of the dance that
closed the ﬁrst half. “Earth Shoe
Waltz.”- '

The ﬁrst dance. set tothe music of
Beethoven's “Moonlight Sonata."
involved ﬁvc dancers occupying fair-
ly ﬁxed positions on the stage. going
through a series of balletic
movements almost in unison. “Earth
Show Waltz.“ set to music of Miles
Davis. emphasized the interplay
between two people as they took
turns leading each other back and
forth across the stage. It was a fast-
paced journey which also took them
up and down through the various
vertical levels.

Aninteresting contrast to this was
a dance called "Eclipse" for ﬁve
dancers, in which the movement was
slower and more subdued. fitting in
very well with the plaintive music by
Katchaturian that was used. This
dance was striking choreographical-
ly in that there were two pairs of
dancers that were always dancingin
close proximity. at times physically
entwined. The choreographer was
able to use this to suggest two bodies
existing as one entity with several ex-
tra limbs. and thereby present some
very interesting patterns of arm and
leg movements.

Jerry Garcia thrilled a packed
Capitol Theater in Passaic, New
Jersey, Friday night, to the surprise
of no one.

The axe master from the good old
Greatful Dead displayed his
familiar. effortless lead style
throughout the evening. Garcia's
pure. smooth tones pierced the
audience. behind the strong founda-
tion of John Kahn‘s bass and Ron
Tutt on drums. Keith Godchaux
provided the band with a top notch
piano performance. with his wife
Donna Jean throating the
background vocals.

The show began on time with
warm-up act Unclc Vinty, a lunatic
pianist. Complete with ﬂashing
lights and white leotards. Uncle Yin-
ty insulted the crowd's intelligence
for twenty minutes, then left before
he could leave any lasting damage
on the evening's entertainment.

The second half of the program
was truly remarkable. The bulk of it
was taken up by a work called
"Atom Heart Mother Suite.”
choreographed by Maude Baum,the
instructor for the group. Set to eerie
music of Pink Floyd. this work is a
terrifying and moving experience in
which basic human emotion is ex-
posed throughout. From the begin-
ning. it is apparent that there is no
restraint in this work; the piece
opens with a burst of screaming
coming from half of the ap-
proximately twenty dancers in the
piece. They are clinging to a railing
encircling a platform above the stage
and writhing torturedly. The boun-
dary between dance and theater
becomes blurred: there is a plentiful
use of voice and facial expression
and a deﬁnite story is being told.

The story of “ Atom Heart Mother
Suite“ is partly one of approach and
rejection; time and again the
members of one groupof the dancers
individually approach each of the
dancers in the other group. attemp-
ting to touch them and/being repuls-
ed in fear. When eventually the
barriers are broken down. and the
dancers ﬁnd themselves in joyous
couples. there is a feeling of immense
release. This state does not last.
however; the work goes in cycles.
Repeatedlythe dancers surge toward
the center of the stage. only to be
held back by each other or by some
force that is greater than them.

There is one section where one
'group ofthe dancers is attemptingto
dance together. and each one of

them is struggling to make the rest of I

them follow and do it their way.
Finally. the whole thing dis-
integrates in the argument and one
dancer is left on the stage. wailing
repeatedly, “But I can‘t do it alone.“
The message of this scene is
emphasized when the same thing
happens all over again. The rest of
the dancers try to come to the aid of

Yeah. everybody knows that the
record biz is rotten. The stuff regular
people call music. record tycoons
call product. Nauseating. In spite of
all that. RCA. while not exactly
radiantly pure at heart (remember
An Evening wiIh John Derive/i). has
done some pretty commendable
things. They haven‘t dumped Lou
Reed into the Hudson yet. They
bought Bowie's early Mercury LPs
and re~relcascd them. And now
they’ve issued The Sun Sessions.
Less praiseworthy. but not a total
washout. is A Legendary Performer

‘Family’ Affair

by David Taffet

From the moment the curtain rose
at the Helen Hayes Theatre in New
York. we knew this was no ordinary
revival. The Royal Family by Edna
Ferber and George S. Kaufman is as
sparklineg refreshing as anything
recently seen on Broadway.

The characters in the play are bas-
ed upon the theatrical Barrymore
family. Their conﬂict between their
love of public life and a growing
desire for privacy develops into sheer
comic madness. All of the characters
are well drawn into interweaving
subplots which merge to form one
giant success.

Since the death of her husband.
Fanny Cavendish. the aging Grande
Dame of the American theatre. has
headed the theatrical family. Her
East Fifties Neq York duplex is the
centerpiece f orthe procedings. She is
proud ofthe dynasty she has created
and hopes to make a comeback after
fully recovering from her recent il-
lness. In the meantime. she oversees
the careers of the other family
members.

Least fortunate or talented is Fun-
ny's brother. Herman. Herman has
become box ofﬁce poison. but no
one has the heart to confront him
with this directly. Herman's wife.
Kitty. anxious to further her
husband's career and begin one of
her own. pushes him into the family
mainstream. while the family subtly
pushes him back out.

Julie. Fanny's daughter. has let
too much of her life slip by. devoting
all of her energy to her profession.
Not until Gwen. a third generation
Cavendish decides to give up her
promising career. does Julie begin to
realize what they all have missed.

Tony. Julie‘s brotheris in constant
trouble. Whether escaping from
Hollywood where he has killed the
director of his latest picture or is es-
caping from Europe where he has
won the affections of a countess and
stands to be arrested for breach of
promise. he lends excitement to the
family and comedy tothe stage as he
drops in the New York apartment
while traveling between.

Outstanding in the cast is Eva
LaGalliennc us Fanny. The seventy-
sevcn year old actress appears on
stage throughout most of the
production and leads the cast with
an energy and enthusiasm rarely
seen on stage. Her grace and
slegancc arcjust right for the head of
the Royal Family and hercharm and
poise endear her instantly to every
member of the audience.

Mary Louise Wilson. as Kitty
Dean. Fanny‘s sister-in-Iaw. was my
favorin among the supporting cast.
She has the knack for getting the
maximum comic effect from a sim-
ple chortle or gesture and for making
the simplest lines hilarious. I only
wished she had been on stage more.

Rosemary Harris as Julie and
Sam Levine as Oscar. the family's
agent. were both excellent. Ellis
Rnbb. who played Tony. also
directed. As Tony. his pacing was
facile and set the tone for the rest of
the cast.

A synopsis ofthe story does not do
justice tothe play. The Royal Family
is one of the funniest plays l‘ve seen
on Broadway and if you will be in
New York during the Easter recess
or during the summer (for this ﬁne
production surely has a long. healthy
run ahead of it). i urge you to spend
an evening with The Royal Fernin
