After being humiliated in the first

r game of the season-opening double

header to 'New Paltz. 2l-5. the
Albany Great Dane varsity baseball
team was goingto bequite pleasedto
come away with a split.

But three last-inning runs by the
host Hawks in the nighteap. sent the
Danes away with a sourtasteintheir
mouths and a 9-lisecond-gameloss.

The double dip left Albany with a
4-5 SUNYAC recordga continua-
tion of their 4-3 fall mark.

Oddly enough. the day began
quite well for the Danes. With one
out in the first inning of the opener.
second baseman Jeff Silverman
reached on an error. 0n the very
next pitch. third baseman Jim
Willoughby blasted a shot to center-
ficld that—aided by the wind—
carried up and over the fence for a
two-run homer. And that came off
one of the best pitchers around: New
Paltz‘s Tom Whitaker.

When Albany starter John
Dollard retired the side without inci-
dent in the bottom of the frame. it
seemed like it might beaninteresting
afternoon forthe visitors. It was. but
certainly not from a victorious point

the'hosts came up with another big
inning by tallying eight more runs—
this time off reliever Pete Bulger—to
claim an insurmountable I6-3 ad-

Larry Panella‘s grand slam homer.

Silverman‘s fourth-inning home
run and Howie Markowitz‘s rbi
single in the seventh were of no avail
as New Paltz just kept pounding
away.

A five-run sixth closed out the
Hawk‘s scoring with the runs this
time coming off lefty Roger Plantier.
But the story of this game was not
the Hawk's offense. but the Danes'
defense. Before the game was over.

total of nine errors as compared to

So President Emmett Fields

mission Fields said purpose or
focus would be just as applicable

~~ that many say pervades the
tenure process and all policy-

Fields: “We Had To Get The Money On ”

Fields cited the dearth of state

done at universities as well us our
location at a sophisticated
government laboratory as prime
reasons for his emphasis on
public policy analysis.

He add. “We SUNYA. are
young enough not to have es-

quotes faculty members who
agree. saying that our “image or
identy in the public mind has not
yet congealed.“

The administration has been
criticized for not defining public
policy and for intolerance to
those areas which inherently have
little to do with it.

in this university should . . .

Carey Taken To Court For
Paying Axed Employees

by Ed Moser

NYI’IRG is taking Governor
Hugh Carey to court.

The New York Public Interest
Research Group. Inc. has obtained a
show of cause order from the
Supreme Court requiring Carey and
State Comptroller Arthur Levitt to
justify payment of salaries to state
employees whose positions were
abolished by the legislature in the
recently enacted 1976-77 budget.

The legislature has reduced cer-
tain appropriations requested by the
governor. thereby abolishing a
number of state positions.

“It lines up as a constitutional bat-
tle between the governor and the
legislature." remarked Donald Ross.

W

many [health-related] questions
that could be analyzed." He said.
"Merely turning out practitioners
is public service. not public policy
analysis.“

When it was pointed out that a -
definition of public policy has yet
to be established. the President
said.“/\t first it is necessary to
talk in metaphor. The specifiees
will begin to develop this summer
when the mission study report
comes out."

As to what he. as President. is
doing to provide the impetus for
the change. Fields said. “First is
the allocation of faculty lines to
those areas. including the
Graduate School of Public Af-
fairs. the School of Criminal
Justice. the School of Social
Welfare. and the School of
Business. which can fly this
banner. Then. the mission study

. . has reduced proposed expen-
ditures. The governor is defying the
law by ordering the payment of
salaries to persons whose jobs have
been terminated.“

The Assembly Ways and Means
Committee had issued a report deal-
ing withthc reduction ofstate expen-
ditures and naming those positions
that have been terminated.

“NYPIRG is challenging the
manner in which money is ap-
propriated f orthe st ate budget." said
Dennis Kaufman. attorney for the
plaintiffs. “The constitution requires
the governor to itemize his budget
hills so that the legislature can
properly scrutinire all expen-
ditures." He said. “Governor Careyjs
budget bills contain numerous lump
sum appropriations that could easily
be shifted. thereby thwarting the in-
tent of the legislature."

NYI’IRG maintains that because
lump sum appropriations are
prevalent in the budget bills. neither
the legislature nor the taxpayers
know where tax money is really be-
ing spent. The organization claims
the budget should be ﬂexible enough
to allow the efficient operating of
state government. while providing
accountability us to where and how
money is being spent.
