SA Hats Are Thrown

by Paul Rosemth

Nominations for student govern-
ment positions close today as SA of-
ficials prepare for the balloting.
scheduled to take place April 27. 28.
and 29.

Up for election are the ofﬁces of
Student Association President and
Vice President. SASU Delegate. and
student representativesto University
Senate. University Council. and
SA‘s Central Council.

As of press time. ﬁve candidates
had announced that they were in the
runnning for the SA presidency.
'l'wo othch have said that they are
running for the VP spot.

Those announced for the top spot
are: Steve DiMeo. Matt Kaufman.
Jonathan Levcnson. Jay Miller. and
Ray Nichols.

Most of the candidates agrecdthat
the grcttter portion of cumpaingning
would be done the week following

I SUNYA‘s spring break. Headed by

former central Council represen-
tative. Neil O'Connor. SA‘s Election
Commission will be preparing for
the voting.

Some of the candidates say they
want to see a campaign based more
on issues. titan those of the past
were. Levenson said. “I want people
to vote for me because they like my
ideas."

Common Sense. a group that
attempted to gain mass student sup-
port to endorse one candidate. died
due to luck of interest after its ﬁrst
meeting. A spokesperson for the
group. Daniel O‘Connell. agreed
that sudcnt politieians“\veren't will-
ing to work just on ideological
grounds."

Kaufman said that past SA elec-
tions have been characterized by
students making very general
promises to the voters. Of his cam-
paign. he said. “I'm not going to
promise things to anyone." He said
the key to his victory would be“get-
ting the people out to vote.“

Spread The Word

DiMeo said he plans to rely on
friends and acquaintances spreading
the word of his campaign. He suid.“l
expect to go door-todoor on us
many quads its possible."

When asked about thssigns usual-
ly plastered around the podium and
quads, Kaufman quippcd. "I suwthe
janitors pulling them down.“ Other
candidates doubted the eff ectlvencstt
of these signs. Levenson said.”lfand
when I use signs. I'm going to use
them to explain why I'm running."

Voters will choose it new SA Presi-
dent und Vice President separately.

APRIL 9, 1976

although some candidatesin the past
have chosen to run on a two-person
ticket. SA Vice President Rich
Meckler. elected aftercoordinatinga
campaign with president Andy
Bauman said. “It makes a good
working team.“ He does not think,
however. that runnning a campaign
with Bauman played any part in his
election.
Two-Person Ticket

DiMeo said he is seriously inv
terested in a twu-person ticket for
this year‘s election. Speaking of Vice
Presidential candidate Jeff
Hollander. Di Meo said. “We‘re con—
sideringit, but we haven‘t committed

 

that this university taker. the max-

_ imum precautions pouible for'th‘e
g prevention of ﬁre.‘ Scharl'r corn-

 

ments wcrc‘prompted by Monday
morning‘s dormitory fire at Skid-
more which took the life of one stu-

‘dent and caused 19 others to be

hospitalized for smoke inhalation
“We try to providcthe Infect en-
vironment possible by maintaining
our equipment. training employees.
and not piling trash carelelly about.‘
All trash rooms are kept locked. and
contain automatic sprinkler systems.
The sprinklers will activate the
building alarm as well as the power
plant alarm.” said Scharl who holds
a primary responsibility in main-
taining the safety of all building on

Bryant Monroe is the other an-
nounced candidate for SA Vice
President.

Candidates Forum

All of the candidates have been in-
vited to a “Candidates Forum"
program to be broadcast on WSUA
Friday. April 23. and Sunday. April
25.

Mcckler said this year‘s campaign
probably will not be much different
from the elections of past years. He
said. “The onlyissue is competency.“
and called upon students to choose
candidates based on their past per-
formance.

Freebies Planned for

by Sue Mlller

Free beer. Free ice cream. Free
soda. A SUNYA dream? Perhaps,
but the dream becomes reality after
the vacation.

A bill passed by Central Council
on March 3| appropriates $700 to
provide students with free beer. ice
cream and soda on the podium on
sunny days,

According to Central Council

member Jonathan Levenson. » co-
introducer of the bill. free food will
be distributed the week students
return from vacation. There will be
have taps for beer and Student
Association will also provide soda
and ice cream for students who are
on the wagon.

The drinks and ice cream will be
served by FSA employees. Students
will need tax cards and proof in

Budget Cuts Confuse Legislators

continued from page one
Only under the heading‘longerter‘m
effects“ did the Task Force explain
that it would soon be necessary to
cut entire programs in order to
preserve others.
do Ftelds' Report on Priority and
Resources. he often refers tothe next
year without mentioning the longer-
rangc purposes of the Task Force.
He lists the charges of the Task
Force. stating simply that it advised
him “on the development of the un-
iverslty‘s operating budget for the

’ next year." The only reference to its

other purpose-deciding what
programs have priority for claiming
future rcsources~is a short
paragraph saying. "The Task Force
also made recommendations on
position reullocations for I977-78.“

oAlthough it clearly specified
where all cuts were to be made. the
Task Force was less clear on where
those llrics being reallocated were in-
tended to go.

"At one point in time the Task
Force had numbers." said SUNYA
Controller John Hunlgan. himself a
member. Ultimately, hOWever. these

were not used because the Task
Force didn‘t want "to pin down the
administration."

OThe 90-day deadline for the Task
Force applied to the SLJ million in
mandated cuts. but Fields insisted
that reallocation decisions for I977-
78 be made then. too —dccisions
that could have been made months
later. “It's a matter of psychology."
explained Fields. “It should be done
cleanly. clearly. boldly. within a
limited amount of time."

Not Unchallenged

But Fields' mission-does not go
unchallenged. “That mission is
assigned to him by the Board of
Trustees." says Assemblyman
Lundes. "if in fact the mission is
narrowed or not responsive to what
the Board now feels is adequate
governing policy for SUNY. the
Board should correct it." Lander
cited the elimination of Nursing as a
possible example.

Fields is conﬁdent. however. that
the state will be supportive: "They’re
trying to get state agencies to shape

‘ up. If someone does it and then gets
kicked inthe teeth. the game is over."

heat tensitizers to set oil an alarm
when the temperature exceeded a
certain heat level. 1

Most of the students were sleeping
when the alarm did sound, slowing
the evacuation process. Since most
hallways were ﬁlled ‘ with smoke.
many students jumped from their
room windows. while others slid to
safety via bedshéets tied together.

According to ScharlSUNYA'sup- ,

town dormitory floors are separated
by ﬁre resistant materials and each
suite has its own heat sensor. Every
ﬂoor houses a ﬁre house in the
stairwell. Dependingonjurisdiction,
the quads are serviced either by the
McKnownvillc or Albany Fire
Departments. each. which upon
notiﬁcation. takes four to ﬁve
minutes to reach the campus.

The downtown buildings contain
ﬁre extinguishers in every hallway.
The alarm systems are linked direct-
ly to the Albany Fire Department.

With regard to safety regulations.
Schatl said that safety employees
must attend monthly orientations
and lectures reviewing safety
methods and information. In I975.
summer orientation for incoming
freshmen offered a videotape of fire
equipment operation.

Scharl stressed ﬁre drills as the es-
sential safety regulation. Three drills

According to Scharl. smoke in-

halation is the primary cause of

death during ﬁre. He said that 95%

of ﬁre deaths are a result of noxious
» fumes, in smoke being inhaled."
False Alums ' ‘

A constant problem forthe Safety
Dept. at SUNYA is the excessive
number. of false alarms issued month- '
ly. Scharl said that since the bein-
ning of the I975 fall semesters total
of 55 false alarms have been issued.

Overall. Scharl says he's satisﬁed
with the maintainance of safety
regulations at the University. A re-
cent regulation states that any new
construction blueprints must be ap-
proved by Scharl‘s department for
adherence to safety codes. Schurl
said that SUNYA buildings are
“. . . .assafeas possible. Theymea
all existing ﬁre codes and New York
Building Construction codes.“

Scharl will be going to Saratov
Springs today to investigate the
cause of the Skidmore ﬁre with
Public Safety ofﬁcials.

According to Hogan. Skidmore'r'

replied. "I couldn‘t say atthistirnc.”

Fields Gets the Money Out

continued from page one
and in the future. the overall stafﬁng
of the university."

It is the reallocation of faculty
lines at the expense of other
departments that has spurred
criticism.

“Students choose curricula accor-
ding to their own sense of what is
best for their lives. What they choose
has changed in the past ﬁve years."
said Fields. menningthat enrollment
in certain programs is putting the
faculty-student ratio well above
average.

Fields went on to describe what he
called thc"evcn-handcd dribble.“ He
said "The institution tried to make
cuts evenly throughout the universi-
t;. This hurts overall performance
because it gives the university more
departments that are weaker."

"Given the magnitude ofthe cuts.
the only goodthingto doisto reduce
our obligations from I29 programs
to 109." he said. Fields stressed the
point that the slashing of 20
programs was monetarily-
mandated. not policy. He suld."Thc
same evaluation would have tnken
place regardless of whether we were
public-policy oriented or not. We
had to get the money out."

The subject then shifted to the
tenure process and its relation to the

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

mission. since stafﬁng of the univer-
sity includes who remains.

Fields prefaced this interview by
stating that he would not “talkabout
the speciﬁc qualiﬁcations of any in-
dividual." thereby eliminating any
questions regarding the Brown and

‘ Knight tenure cases.

“The awarding of tenure it a
predictive judgment based on
evidence that the candidate will be
productive in the f utrue." Fields con-
tinued. “There is a $600.000commit-
ment involved." Fields said, “Equal-
ly important in evaluating can-
didates are teaching and con-
tributions to one‘s ﬁeld. The use of
outside letters of review is the best
way to determine if one has made a
mark." '

Ftelds defended the Advisory
Council on Promotion and Tenure
against criticism saying “the
procedure has been examined by
SUNY Central and passed."

“The release of the reports which
deal with characteristics of in-
dividuals and outside evaluation
would be mischievous in. the ex-
treme. It is meant to protect in.
dividualtt from becoming matters of ,
public debate." said Fteld‘l.

Currently. the tenure cam of
Brown and Knight "are being
publicaly debated. nevertheless.
