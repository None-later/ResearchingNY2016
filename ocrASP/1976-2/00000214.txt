“The voice of the dolphin in air‘ is
like that of the human.“ Aristotle
wrote in 300 BC. Four hundred
years later, I’linius Secundus
shortened this description to read,
“the voice of the dolphin is like
human wailing.“ Today, if dolphins
could speak English. they would cry
out against human whaling.
Through extensive whaling in the
last 50 years. the great whale has
become an endangered species.
The Blue whale is the largest
creature ever to inhabit the earth,
lhrcc times the size of the average
dinosaur. Adults get up to 100 feet
long. and weigh I40 tons. They can

The Irish poet William Butler
Yeats once wrote: “Yet I am certain
that. in the long run. his [Syttge‘s]
plays with their lyric beauty. their
violent laughter, The I’luylntvol'llw
ll’urtt'rn War/t1 Inosl of all. will he
loved for holding so much of the
mind of Ireland.“

Last night SUNYA‘s production
of Playboy opened. and tile “mind of
Ireland“ was beautifully kindled.
John Millington Syngc‘s play con-
cerns the exploits of young Christy

Mayo with a tale of patricidc, which
at once cndcnrs and ostracizes him to
an odd cast of villagers. His ego

swim 20 mph. blow water 30 feet into
the air, and when killed, yield l0.000
gallons of oil. These gentle monsters
are near extinction.

The Finback whale is the second
largest creature to inhabit the earth.
They can grow to 82 feet. and weigh
90 tons. As the population of Blue
whales declined. more Finbacks
were hunted. Audobon magazine in
a January, I975 article, declaredthat
unless they receive a half century of
full protection. they too will be ex-
tinct.

Moby Dick was a sperm whale. 66
feet long and weighing 55 tons.
Sperm whales are the only great
whales that have teeth. The whaling

swelling as his fame spreads, Christy
manages to vanquish nll competition
and even win the heart of I’cgcen
Mike. a shebccn keeper. His reign as
“Playboy of the Western World." is
pre-emptcd by the unexpected
arrival of his “dead” father./\s a
playwright. Synge rejects an intellec-
tual approach to theatre for the
presentation of the peasant folk,
their phrases and actions.
The director. Edward Golden. has
made the language and dialect ol‘tlte
. play the star of the production. The
language is mastered well by the ac-
tors; it acquires textures like rough-
hcwn wool or course wool cloth, and
scents like hay and bogwater.

l

industry killed sperm whales for
ambergris. meat, bone. and 6.000.
gallons of oil per whale. These
leviathans are near extinction.

The Bowhead whale is covered by
two feet of blubber. A single
howhead yieldsan average l5tons of
whalebone and 2.500 gallons of oil.
Fully protected by international
convention since I935, it hasn't
recovered signiﬁcantly. The rotund
bowhead wears a pleasant expres-‘
sion. and appears to .swim toward
extinction with a smile on its face.

Dr. Richard Kelly of the biology
department grows blond hair on his
face. smokes a pipe. and does his
own wailing. He doesn't want the
rest of the great whales to go down
the same road the Atlantic gray
whale. the Korean gray whale. and
the Bowhcad whale (from Arctic
waters cast of Greenland) went;
shoved off the sidewalk into the
boulevard of extinction.

Dr. Kelly would like to see a
moratorium on whaling. and he isn't
alone in this. Many other groups and
individuals want to see the transfor-
mation of whales into bicycle seats,
lipstick. margarine, shoe polish, and

The language and action distill an
essence of reality, rather than
creating a photographic reproduc-
tion. The humor is broad and sen—
sual.

The United States. Great Britain.

Norway. and the Netherlands, all

members of the IWCand once major
whaling nations. have discontinued
their whaling ﬂeets. The United
States has made it illegal to kill any
whale, or to import any type of
whale product. '

The Soviet Union and Japan. also
members of the IWC. still continue
to hunt whales extensively. Chile
and Peru don‘t belong to the IWC.
and they account for a lesser amount
of the whaling industry.

The IWC has regulated against the
taking of Right whales (so called

because it was just "right" for'

Whalers. easy to kill and full of oil).
blue. gray. and humpback whales.
The taking of any female with calve
is forbidden. and minimum sizes are
fixed for all catchable species. But
the IWC has no enforcement agency.

In I963 the IWC quota for blue
whales was 15,000. At the end ofthe
year only “2 were reported killed.
The implications were clear; either
the quota was too high. or the in-
dustry wasn't reporting all of its kills.

The IWC then forbid the killing of
all blue whales under a certain size.
In doing so it hoped to protect the

Moanchildren. the play was placed
in a historical and political context
at the expense of the important
dramatic conflict of characters. In
Playboy the production avoids this.
Robert Donnelly's set design is sim-
ple and yet imaginatively conceived.
Syngc‘s language is so delicious and
rhythmic. that it constantly renews
itself and ttvoids becoming a period
piece. 'I‘hedialoguc does not become
dated. as does the dialogue of
Moonchildren. which seemed to he
"camp" after only ten years.

The acting in Playbuyis balanced
and superb. No one actor dominates
and the action and energy are evenly
dispersed. Pamela Nyberg as I’egeen
Mike plays a womanwith a hard
facade to cover her tender sensitivi-
ty. She has manylstrong moments
where the inner life of her character
is vividly observed. Nelson Avidon
provides an exceptional port rayal of
her feather-headed suitor. the
cartoon-like Shawn Keogh. Steve
Vance as cheen's father, Michael
.lnmes. has a lluld W.C. Field-like
movement. Maria Mtirkie is
provocatively convincing as the
Widow Quinn. Finally. Michael Mo-

“Many‘eyebrow's ‘were‘raised over ~. V A '
the discovery of this new species 
whale. Later. it was discovered that ,-

the Pygmy blue whale is in fact a
baby blue whale. The industry simp- I

ly devised a rubric to circumvent the‘ V

quota."

For the last three years the IWC
has refused a ten-year moratorium
on whaling proposed by the United
States. Some 20 wildlife protection
groups. both Houses of Congress.
the AFL-CIO, and the Departments
of Interior and Commerce have
given their backing to the an-
tiwhaling movement. which en-
dorses a boycott of all Japanese and
Soviet Union products.

In defense. the Japanese claim
that whale meat is an important and
inexpensive source of food for low-
income Japanese. “The question.”
Dr. Kelly asks. “is who owns the
sea.“

Whales have been shown to ex-
hibit a high degree of intelligence in
marine laboratories. Experiments
on smaller species of whales (killer
whales. dolphins, and porpoises.
which are also considered whales)
have caused certain scientists to con-
clude that they are as intelligent as
man.

 

Conkey as Christy is heroic and yet
comic. McConkey seems more con-
ﬁdent and self-assured on stage than
he did as Argon in The Imaginary In—
valid.

The love scenes with Christy and
I’egcen Mike are charged with
beautiful verbal images which are
played off against the still restraint
of the lrish character.

Chris l’aul's portrayal of Christy‘s
lunatic father. shows him as a man
bent and aged. but still filled with a
ferocious tenacity.

The rest of the cast performed
equally well. and the crown scenes
were executed with precise timing in
both their entrances and exits.

Like Christy. the SUNYA produc-
tion of The Playboy oft/re ll’eslern
Wurhlis prize winning. The best art
is always engagement. and Wednes-
day night provided a rare ex-
perience. The engagement of poetry
andtheater was complete. l’layboyis
a classic of modern theater per-
formed with lumination and care.
Please. there will be no greater,
tragedy in this season‘s theater than
missing The Playboy of the Western
World.
