Salant With The

Slant On Sports

The situation is simple: Athletic Finance Committee ( A FC). after carefully
scrutiniu‘ng the proposed Intercollegiate Athletics Budget for l976—77 has

passed a budget of “49.000.

Andrew Bauman. president of Student Association (SA). has publicly
stated he will norrecommend a budget of more than “30.000.

The decision regarding which ﬁgure WILL be the budget for sports next
year will come on the floor of Central Council sometime duringthe next three

weeks.
First, some information.

Each undergraduate student at Albany State pays $66 per year in student
tax; Sl4.50 of each 566 is mandated for intercollegiate athletics. Based on
projected estimates of enrollment. roughly Sl30.000 will be generated.

In past years the intercollegiate budget has been supplemented by funds
from the Athletic Advisory Board (AAB) Surplus. created more than a
decade ago by former SUNYA president Ezra Collins. The original purpose
of the surplus was as a safeguard against inﬂation (at that time. a mere three
percent) and. perhaps. for some construction purpose (ﬁeldhouse. bubble. or

scoreboard).

The surplus was built via excess funds for athletics. created back in the
days when more money than was necessary was generated.
The key factor above all: this money was earmarked for athletics when

collected and when deposited in the 5

urpr account, although members of

Central Council and the executive branch contend it is general mane y for an yr

Student Association use.
in I973. SA President Steve Ger

ber recommended that the surplus be

depicted to prevent AAB from becoming overly dependent upon the surplus
(which was then at roughly 5200.000 and part of which was being used
annually to supplement collected funds). The Gerber plan called for
approximatel y $30,000 a yearto be withdrawn from the surplus and be used
for intercollegiate sports. annually until the surplus was down to $30,000.

In October I975. the current session of Central Council voted to lrcerethe

AAB Surplus in tropes of maintaining it at $l80.000 for construction

Albany UUP's Bruce Marsh ieeis SUNYA'e erred protessors deserve
priority over newcomers who are applying for positions.

by Ed Moss

The- cutbacks recommended by
President Field‘s Task Force have
resulted in disagreement between
SUNYA‘s faculty. the Albany Un-
ited Universt Professions union and

the Personnel Department over the

possible rehiring of those laid—off.

According to a legal contract with
New York State. UUP members are
to be offered ‘special consideration‘
in the 'same or similar' position they
previously occupied. should a job
opportunity arise.

Gary Westervelt, chairman of a
U U P Committee which is
renegotiating the contract. says this
should leave the Personnel Depart-
ment with “no choice“ but to give
jobs to laid-off SUNYA professors.

rather than “going outside the cam— ,

pus“ to hire people. Thus Westervelt
stresses “previous employment" at

 Questions ' Rehiring 

SUNYA for job qualification.

in an article published in the
Albany UUP newsletter. Albany
UUP President Bruce Marsh main-
tained that the university “is under
certain moral and ethical obligations
to its employees. . .to make every
effort to secure suitableemployment
for persons whose jobs were
eliminated through Letrenchment.“

Quality Counts

However. Leon Calhoun of Per-
sonnel feels his Department's job is
to hire the most qualiﬁed person
available. no matter Where the per-
son has previously taught. He
criticizes the UUP as havinga once a
prof. always a prof attitude. and
quotes the part of the contract
stating special consideration should
be given ‘provided that a suitable
position for which the employee is
otherwise qualified is available”.

Plans Pave Way For New Pay Parking Lot

by Matt Kaufman

An estimated $60,000 has been
earmarked for the construction of a
pay parking lot near Colonial Quad.
according to the Office of Manage-
ment and Planning.

The rationale for the building of
the Colonial Quad lot was expressed
in a report by Director of Security
James Williams which said that by
l l a.m. most gravel arcasnroundthe
podium are filled with parked autos.
and half oftlrem are parked illegally.

The report goes on to snythat the
new lot planned to contain l20—l40
parking spaces. “should relieve the
congestion.“ According to Lloyd
llcbcrt who is in charge of Parking
at the University Police Department.
there are about 9500 cars registered
with his department. Ofthosc. 9500.
167 subscribe to the monthly rental
lot located near Dutch Quad. There
is a waiting list of 56 who wish to
park there.

The money forthe lot will betnken
from revenues received by selling
parking decals and issuing tickets.
An additional $|5.()00 from these
funds will go to payellte existing pay
lot near Dutch. ‘

This money makes up the Income
Fund Reirnbur'snl (lFR) which is
recycled throughout the university
for repaying and administration
costs. According to the Office of
Management and Planning last
year‘s ll’li totalled $l2(t.b77 as of
March 3|.

According to Vice President for
Management and Planning John
Hartley. there have been plans to
build a pay lot near Colonial. as well
as State and Indian in tltc future for
several years.

“These two other lots [State and
Indian] may not come to pass." said
Robert Stiercr of Management and
Planning. “and we are looking into
it. There is no deﬁnite timetable for
these lots."

"The Colonial lot will encompass
the grassy southwest area [between
the Quad and the Podium]. which
does include some trees." said Karl
Scharl of the Department of Public
Safety. “These trees would then be
taken out and replanted across the
road.“

“I'd rather not see the lot if there
were a better alternative.“ said Louis
lsmay. geology professor and head

of the Environmental Decisions
Commission (EDC). He explained
that the alternative “would be people
parking where they must park.

tr.

   

We‘ve got a lot of selfish people
around.“

“But the solution is not building
more parking lots.“ said Lynne

.' “a

Jackson chairman of the Recycling
Committee of BBC. “but to look
towards alternate forms of transpor-
tation."

Dutch Quad pay lot ililed to capacity: plans for another lot near Colonial are under way.

SA Candidates Speak Tonight On WSUA

Candidates for Student Associa-

final opportunities to scrutinize
them.

“Candidates‘ Forum." a panel in-
terview of all candidates for SA
President and Vice-President, will be
aired on WSUA tonight at 7:30.
Reporters from both the campus
radio station and the Albany Stu-
dent Press will question the

Jonathan Levcnson. and Jay Miller.
Miller‘s running mate. Bryant
Monroe. has ended his campaign
due to personal dissatisfacton with
the race. Two candidates are now
running for Vice President: Jeff
Hollander and Gary Parker.
Balloting. scheduled for Tuesday,
Wednesday. and Thursday. will also
include races for SASU Delegate.
student representative to University
Council, and for seats on Central
Council and University Senate.

on the , ', ‘s issues.
The program will be rebroadcast
Sunday at 10 pm.

An informal discussion with the
candidates for top positions will be
held Sunday night inthedutch Quad
U-Lounge.

The field of candidates for the SA
Presidency has narrowed to four.
with the announced withdrawl of
Ray Nichols. Remaining in the race
are: Steve Di Meo, Matt Kaufman.

, has centered around the
practice of running a two-person
ticket. Although students will vote
for President and Vice President
seperately. several candidata have
expressed interest in working .as a
team. This year's SA leaders. Presi—
dent Andy Bauman and Vice Presi-
dent Rick Mcekler. were elected
after running a two-person cam-
paign.

Parker. a supporter of Nichols

before his withdrawalfrom the cam-
paign. said there was some talk of a
joint campaign. He decided,
however. “We could get more ac-
complished if weworkedindividual-
ly."

DiMeo and Hollander are run-
ning a two-person campaign.

Oftlre six students runningforthe
top two posts, four have had direct
experience in student government.
having served as representatives to
Central Council. Kaufman and
Parker. the candidates not on Coun-
cil. cite their independence from SA
as a reason they can betrusted by the
voters.

A simple majority is required for
election to either of the two
positions. Many observers believe a
run-off for the Presidency will be
necessary. Each of ‘the four can-
didates have predicted a victory.

' Voting takes place on dinner lines
next week on the quads. Com-
muters cast their ballots in the

vacancy requires." said Calhoun. “A '

professor of Geology mightnot‘be

qualiﬁed for a particular'lield of

Geology."

Westervelt admits “of course
there‘s always someone more '
qualified.” yet counter the contract‘s
purpose is not to rai'sethe qualityof
personnel. but to “protect current
employees."

In turn. Calhoun describes the
present rehiring policy as only fair:
“before publicly advertising a posi- '
tion. we send an announcement of
the vacancy to the retrenched per-
son. and give him l5 days to apply
. . . if he is found qualiﬁed.” says
Calhoun. the job is his.

Calhoun advised UUP to look at
the issue in a broader. “University-
wide” way. For example. be said. “If
we retrench professors here. and
New Paltz rehires." then UUP
should help coordinate the two
schools' needs. And he added laid-
off teachers are tuitions waivers “to
take additional courses for jobs in
other areas.“

“Except for one or two. the
retrenched have not posessed the ex-
perience in the specialized areas.”
stated Calhoun. while Westervelt
ﬂatly said. “I know of no one
retrenched who has been offered
reemployment.“

In his article Marsh said “these
persons [professors. retrenched]
have lost or are about to lose their
positions solely for fiscal or
organizational reasons. not through
any flaw in their performance.“

Westervelt charged President
Fields with “not living up tothe in-
tent of the contract." He said after
the Political Science department had
recommended the rehiring of some
of the Allen Center professors.
Fields had alledgedly "withdrawn
the department's vacant lines."

Westervelt claimed some
departments have written job
qualifications to speciﬁcallycxcludc
certain faculty members. As ex-
amples of ‘ccrtain members“ he cited
Peter Cocks and Craig Hen-
dr'ickson of the Allen Center.
