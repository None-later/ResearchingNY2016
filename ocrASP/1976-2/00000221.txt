More Cheating Found on Admissions Tests

Someday the price of admissionto
a medical or law school aptitude test
may be attaching the arms of the
prospective doctors or lawyers to a
polygraph machine and questioning
them closely.

Are you really (name of
applicant)?‘ Are these statements
about yourself on this application
form true? Have you ever attempted
to falsify the records you have sub-
mitted to us?

Already administrators of the
Law School Admissions
Tcsts( LSAT) have begun to thumb-
print applicants who take the test in-
stead of asking for a driver's license
or otherphoto-bearingidentiﬁcation
as they had in the past. The Medical
Schools Association has asked can-
didates for the Medical College Ad<
missions Test ‘(MCAD to send
photographs when they register for
the exam and these are forwarded to

the test centers where proctors
screen candidates when they arrive.

The increasingly stringent security
applied to professional school en-
‘tranee exams is punlythe result of a
new wave of cheaters who are enroll-
ing in top graduate schools with the
help offalsiftcd docgments and hired
exam-takers. Recently a few big
cases hve come to light and
professional school administrators
assume they are only the tip of the
iceburg.

The most famous case was that of
the husband and wife team who
wungled admittance to Harvard‘s
law and business schools using
falsified transcripts. The team was
caught when the man. Spiro
Pavlovich Ill. bragged to some
lawyers who were interviewing him
for a summerijob.

Without his boasting. the two
Pavlovichs may never have been

found out. Expertly forged
transcripts are difﬁcult to spot inthe
mass of applications which deluge
professional schools. Inside help is
not unheard of. In February, the
president of Brooklyn College
acknowledged that 12 employees of
the school‘s registrar‘s office had
been implicated in transcript-
doctoring “to improve their own
academic records or those of friends
and relatives."

Another case involving heavy
touching-up of a student‘s ofﬁcial
transcript was decided by a Circuit
Court of Virgina in February. The
student. Harold S. Blumenthal. was
convicted of forging and passing a
falsified transcript alter in-
vestigators found that he had
overstated his grades. listed himself
as a summacum laudc graduate and
forged the registrar's signature on
the transcript he submitted to the

medical schools' association
Tests administered by the
Educational Testing Serncc tl-Z'I‘Si
are also increasingly vulnerable to
cheaters as anxious candidates stop
at less and less to win those lt‘vl
precious places in top proletstonal
schools. The E'I‘S has reached the
point where it must aggt'cssttcly
police the people who take tlte tests
and investigate in

V Wright said that the school system
in Cuba supplies the students with as
much tutoring res-necessary. and
strives to keep them all at thevsame
level. He said their system is the
reverse of our system. The bright
students receive less attention while
the less intelligent receive more
attention.

“They have not updated their
curriculum to fit the revolution.
Their main stress is opportunity."
Wright continued. “One quarter
million students are in college so you
can see they are well educated.“

Wright reports that churches in
Cuba attract hardly anybody. “The
state furnishes all emotional and
joyful releases that normally
churches would supply.“ he said.
“The Church doesn‘t say a thing to
them that the revolution doesn‘t
say."

There is no truancy and very little
delinquency in Cuba. according to
Wright. The prisons are open. and
the prisoners are permitted to go
home every weekend. unguarded. In
the mental institutions. he said. the
patients receive regular wages. He
explained that one half of these
wages go to the upkeep of the

once anyone goes there. they can see
how ridiculous it is for us not to."
Wright said. “I am deeply interested
in seeing that we have a cultural ex-
change with Cuba.“

The Cuban people were described

by Wright as having intense dislike
for American government and big
business in the United States. He
said that many Cubans consider
themselves to be black and are deep-
ly upset by the conditions of the
black community.

“It is a sinister and evil thingthat
we have done in relation to that
island." Wright stated.

Wright continued tosay that every
country in the world has diplomatic
relations with Cuba except the Un-
ited States. “The people weretrcated
so badly. everyone in Cuba is
relatively happy now.“

Wright took care to emphasize
that he is not praising Cuba. butjust
hopes that Americans will take ad-
vantage of the cultural information
that it offers. “Cuba has a lot of

problems also. many of which they
don‘t like to admit.” he said.

The women in Cuba are treated as
a class apart from all citizens. he
said. Castro has emphasized the fact
that this has to change. “I personally
believe that they could work onthat
more diligently than they do."
Wright declared. . -

Cuba. the largest producer of cane
sugar and ﬁne tobacco, also has
many Russians. Japanese. and
Canadians who call themselves
Cubans. The island has resort hotels
for one hundred dollars a day and
exists in a peaceful and tranquil at-
mosphere. ‘

Wright said. “The Cubans are an
industrious and contented people.
They know that life for them is in-
finitely better.“
