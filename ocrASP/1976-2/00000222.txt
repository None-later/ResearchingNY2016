The State of Illinois has e” up :

with a biurre plan to reduce the .L '

number of people on  ,

Two Republican State Senators
have introduced a bill offering
welfare recipients $5.000 toluvell-
Iinois for a minimum of threeyears.

The bill's chief sponsor, Senator
David Regner, said he introduced
the bill with “Tongue in Check". But
he added that Illinois could indeed
save 8]]? million over the next three
years if only 3 percent of the public
aid recipients took advantage of the
offer.

vFUEL OR FOOL

Some people say that Sam Leach
has discovered the answer to the
energy crisis.

Others claim that Sam Leach is'
perpetrating the greatest fraud since
P.T. Barnum promoted the Cardiff
Giant.

    

In case you haven't heard, Sam
Leach is a 6l-ycar-old Los Angeles
inventor who claims to have
developed a simple gadget that can
convert ordinary tap water into a
rich hydrogen fuel.

Leach has appeared before scien-
tific audiences with his mysterious
box, which is about the size of a
small 'I'.V. set and has nobs and dials
in front. Leach hooksit uptoa water
hose. turns a few switches, gives it a
jolt of electricity and
. . .prcsto. . .out comes hydrogen.

The problem is that Sam Leach
won‘t let anyone look inside that

. Put a bottle of Jose Cuervo Gold in it.

. Come back later that same day.
. Open the bottle and pour a shot of the

Major investors in Southern
California have advanced up to
$500,000 apiece for future rights to
the Leach machine. Leach, himself.
has 86 patents pending on the
machine. In the meantime, the
securities and exchange commission
is investigating the possibility of an
elaborate fraud.

The S.E.C. investigation is
scheduled to conclude soon—and,
when it's over, Sam Leach will either
be a historic inventor who single-
handedly solved the energy
crisis. . .or perhaps injail.

NICOTINE PARADOX

Consumer Reports Magazine
warns that those low nicotine
cigarettes on the market may be do‘
ing more harm than normal
cigarettes. The Magazinecxplains
that many smokers. addicted to
nicotine, simply end up smoking
more of the low nicotine varieties in
order to satisfy their nicotine crav-
ing.
"he Magazine states that the net
effect is that many smokers end up
inhaling more tar by smoking low
nicotine cigarettes than if they had
remained with their original high-
nicotine brand.

UNION SALUTE

The US. Defense Department is
openly opposing efforts by several
trade unions to unionilc the US.
Armed Forces before 1980.

Pentagon official claim that un-
ions in the armies of other nations
have caused severe morale problems.
The most successful service union is
Europcis the Dutch Guild known as
the Union of Conscripted Soldiers.

During one successful protcse, the
Dutch Union protested the
punishing of a soldier who failed to

 

  
  
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

salute an officer. The union had all

22,000 of its soldier-members salute
everything—from bus drivers to
lampposts to trash cans. After more

. than a year of this protest. the Dutch

Army caved in and changed its
saluting rules.

SLUGGY LUG

If the airlines begin losing your
luggage less often than they used to,
there may be a good reason.

T.W.A. is experimenting in
Newark, New Jersey, with a new
system in which all passengers are
provided with free beer if their
baggage fails to arrive at the claim
area within l4 minutes after they
deplane.

The incentive for the T.W.A.
baggage-service workers is that, if
there's any beer left over because of
prompt service, then they get to
drink the beer instead

On second thought, with all that
beer being downed by the workers,
there‘s probably good reason for
your bags to get lost more oftentltan
before.

SCENTED WHAT?

A Chicago drug firm claims to
have revoluti onizedthe birth control
ﬁeld by coming out with scented
condoms.

The company, Federal; [liar-

ing item in the condom field in at
least ﬁve years. “Scentuals' come in
four odors—lime, strawberry, mask

Federal Pharmacal is the same

PHONE CENSUS

A.T&T. reports that seven U.S.
cities—~Brooklinc, Massachusetts;
Washington DC; Southﬁeld.
Michigan; Champaign, Illinois;
Cambridge, Massachusetts; San
Francisco and Palo Alto,
California—all have more
telephones than people.

This means that if all the phones
rang at once, there wouldn't be
enough people around to answer
them.

  
 
  
  

HIGH TEST
The insurance Institute for
highway safety claims to have
perfected a simple and highly effec-
tive test to determine ifa driver~ or
anyone else forthat matter—is ston-
ed on marijuana.

The Institute says that three
researchers at the University of
Scranton in Pennsylvania have
developed a compound that will at—
tach itself to the T.H.C. molecule——
the active ingredient in pot—but not
to other molecules.

According to the researchers, the
chemical is added to a blood sample
and a“ Fluorescent Means“ is used to
spot the pot. The test can
reportedlydetect T. H.C. in the blood
in concentrations of less than one
part per billion.

EROTOPOTEST AXED
A SIZI,000 study on sex and the
marijuana smoker was shelved this
week by the House of Represen-
tatives.
The House passed and sent tothe
Senate legislation to cut offfunds for

the Southern Illinois University
grant, which earlier had been ap~
proved for funding by the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and
Welfare.

The study was to be conducted by
Doctor Harris Rubin of Southern ll-
linois in attempts to determine.

among other things, if male students
experienced different reactions to
erotic movies while stoned on pol.

Many law makers claim it is a
waste of money to pay students to
smoke the evil weed and then to
watch X-rated movies.
