I sat down in the library last week
(across from this dynamite looking stu-
dent) reading a column about senior
freakout. I must admit. I was deeply
touched. Did you hear the violins in the
background too? Now let me present to
you my view on graduation. orthclighter
side of four year s at college. My first reac-
tion is. “God. where the hell did the four
best years of my life go?“ An answer such
as “up your nose with a rubber hose" is
not appropriate at the moment. Nor is
stepping on my face to prevent further
discussion of the topic.

No matter what we say. we will miss
our college years. Who can deny that
some day in our future there will bca mo—
ment when we look brick and chuckle at
some of thc stunts wc pullcd asstudcnts.

Bcing a student automatically gives us
the right to do as we please and almost
always get away with it without feeling
shame or embarrassment. This is the same
logic. by the way, offered by F.S.A. for
their frnc, dining gourmet sclcction.

As first year students (whether
freshman or transfers) we would all walk
around in a fog the first few weeks. After
spending 50 minutes in a classroom. you
discover that your class was down the hall
and you just missed a pop quil. which
counted for only 99% of your grade. The
professor in a congenial manner told you
not to worry just study hard forthe final
and cvcr‘yt hing will bctakcn into account.

tion) wc won't dcvulop ulccr problems.

the worst but after learningthey called it a

I would love to meet that nutritionist
who. through her professional training
and expertise, would concoct the follow-
ing menu—split pea soup. corn or rice to
go with your spaghetti and sauce, bread,
and cake or ice cream for dessert. Simply
brilliant! F.S.A. in their inﬁnite wisdom.

potatoes for rice. Much better!

Aftcr overcoming the meat (pardon my
ovcrstatcmcnt it‘s an insult to cattle) it
was timc for dessert. I was under the im-
pression it was mcant to be ingested. not

entering as a concerned student the guilt
associated with cutting a class was just
unbearable. I always felt that I would
miss somethingimportant and fail mytest
because of missing that class. However
when I attended classes, all I did was the
NY Times puzzle and read the ASP per-
sonals. So I finally did it. That night I
couldn‘t sleep because I was sure the prof
knew I wasn‘t there (even though it was a
standing room only LC 7 class). The next
session each time the prof looked in my
direction I would get that sinking feeling
(almost like the one the passengers felt on
the Poseidon. or stepping into a pile of
dog shit). However I bought life savers
and became accustomed to it easily.

Time passed and I adjusted to college
norms (ifsuchthings exist). Icvcn learned
the truth about ourlibrary. They did have
books but that was only secondary to
studying the people who were looking at
them (notice—I didn't use the word
reading . . . Pay attentionl: you‘re not
in a class nowl).

A year came and went with many
friendships made only to be forgotten. I
was smarter, a sophomore now. I had cx-
pcricnccd the withdrawal symptoms of
dropping my first course (due to the fact
that I scored 8 points out of 100 on my
Calculus l midterm). Now for the big
times. (ioingto lhc barstomcct women. I

By the way, they exercised our original
brainstorms. we got drunk and I was
carried half way home. So much for pick-
ing up women at bars.

Living with three derelicts (one a
prominent personality on WSUA and an
excellent bullshit artist) I became familiar
with the evil weed. I never tried it until
that fateful dayin April. At ﬁrst I thought
I was living with three participants in a
well experimented and researched study
on marijuana conducted by the govern-
ment. They each smoked about twenty
joints a day; a minimum of five before
each meal was a must.

After almost two semesters of living
with them I observed no signs of polio,
cancer, or green hair—brain damage I
can‘t vouch for. Word spread that l was
going to try it. A couple of people in the
section came to witness it. ldrcw a breath.

the room, anothcr crowd in the suite

I also met girls at that time. My luck
was running high and I managed to go out I
with two in that year. One was cute and a
good student and the other was blondc.
pretty. but a little misguided. Well, my
brains told me one thing and I did the
other—yes, the blonde. Somehow the
first one managed to put up with me fora
whole week. That in itself was deserving
of an award. The blonde, on the other
hand. took a liking to me—even more
amazing. I had good times for a while (a
day or two). Was this what college was
about?

much calmer, and supposedly in demand
(boy, did someone pull one over me). I
took 20 credits second semester
sophomore year and passed them all. I
had to if I were to graduate on time. This
made me feel confident going into the
third year at college. My first vow was to
change my study habits. I was sick and
tired of cramming 8 weeks of work into a
mic night scssion. I'm an accounting ma-
jor, a profession exemplified by organiza-
tion. proper preparation and logical
thinking. Pcrbaps I never really wanted to
be an accountant after all.

The first weeks of school brought
beautiful weather so . . . I wound up

thc kill. The only results it brought were a
few knifcd egos. all mine. Don‘t laugh! If
you are, I hope you're forced to listen to
your professor because of forgetting to
pick up a newspaper before the class.

Some social changes occurred. An cx-
trcmcly good friend of mine transferred
out in January. He was no longer able to
cope with the school‘s pressures—a bio
major. naturally (prc-mcd). I learned to
live with people exhibiting different life

‘ styles. For instance. my roommate was a

smart, soft spoken person. However,
scientists and doctors alike were trying to
explain wiry he was in an REM state 24
hours a day. It was for this that l
nicknamed him "Mr. Excitement".

I met morc girls . . . friends, of
course! Whatever lurppcncd tothose peo-
ple who enjoyed relationships. besides the
platonic ones? Not much else occurred
junior year. However. I do remember
having to drop my major course at the
end of spring semester (cost accounting).
