Seven students are responsible for

90 percent of the routine transpor-

ting needed by the Student Health

Service. a fact most people at the un-

iversity arc probable unaware of . ac-

cording to Dr. Janet Hood. “We

couldn‘t live without them.“ she said.

These students drive inﬁrmary

patients to and from dormitories.

doctor‘s ofﬁces. However. Dr. Hood
stressed that this is “not a taxi ser-
vice" and said that all requests for
. transportation are screened to deter-
mine whether the service is necessary
in each particular case.

Betty Capona. a secretary at the
inﬁrmary. dispatches the calls to the
drivers during the daytime. At night
and on the weckendsthe dispatching
is handled by nurses.

Friday. the student is expected to be
at the infirmary waiting for calls. At
night and on weekends. time on call
does not have to be spent at the inﬁr-
mary but rather the student must
carry a walkie-talkie with him
wherever he goes. Work on the
weekdays is fairly routine. while
nights and weekends are unpredic-
tublc.

While not all work the same
number of hours per week. someone
is on duty 24 hours a day. seven days
a week while school isinscssion. The
drivers are responsible for the vehi-
clc (which is provided by the univer-
sity) and must see that it‘s in good
shape and that the gas tank is kept
i‘ull. Right now a blue International
van is on permanent loan from the
motor pool.

Routine transport applies to any
case in which the patient is too sick;
or injured to thc extent that would

preclude his getting to the inﬁrmary.
hospital, or doctor‘s ofﬁce on his
own (Le. a high fever or a sprained
ankle). It also involves driving
patients to local hospitals and doc-
tors for x-rays and transporting
blood samples to three laboratories
downtown. since the infirmary takes
no x-rays and does no lab work.
While any necessary horizontal
transports are handled by 5 Quad
Ambulance. the student drivers
provide necessary transporting that
is not urgent enough to be done by
ambulance.

The drivers are in constant contact
with the inﬁrmary while on call and
when transporting. A walkic-talkic
system is the connection betwecnthe
driver and the front desk—the driver
can be diverted at any timeto a more
urgent transport if necessary. The
nurses that decide on the severity of
the cases have to use theirjudgment'.

The students are paid out of the
Student Affairs budget—they must
be employed by the university in

chigcr went on to say that
“cvcrytime there‘s something spec-
tacular on campus we‘re hopping."
Thcy average about five calls
whenever there‘s a quad or Campus
Center party. 70 calls is the average
for an entire week.

Between January 17and March21
the drivers answered 638 calls. 107 of
these came between February 9 and
February 13. during the flu
epidemic. During the flu outbreak
they performed miscellaneous
chores in thc infirmary when not in-
volvcd in transports. Tom Weber (a
senior) slept in thc inlirmnry a few
nights during the flu epidemic. ac-
cording lo chigcr. “We helped the
nurses out so they could do more im-
portant things." David Schubmeh‘
said.

Schubmchl. who‘s been at thcjob
for over a ycur. said that “it started
out as just at job~but now 1 really
like it tilot. It‘s one of the best
things.“ \thn he started the job.
chigcr took him out and showed
him “the tlil'lcrcnt placcs we'd have
to go and take people." These includ-
cd Albany Medical Center ttpd
Memorial and St. Peter's Hospitals
its well as Bender lilh and labs on
New Scotland and Central Avenue.
Dnin trips are made to Dr. Etkin‘s
ofﬁce. where many ofthc x-rays are
taken.

Dr. Hood said that “we don‘t 1ch
that it‘s important l'orthcm to ltave
first aid training." The Student
Health Scrvicc uses their services as
you would a family car.

Mrs. Akullian is in charge of hir-
ing the student drivers and working
