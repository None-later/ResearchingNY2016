 Sitcomsl

by Lon Levin

A few years back a group of television
business people gathered aroundalarge
table and discussed clever ideas. “Hey,
I‘ve got a great situation" said one man,
“How about two young people in love?”
“Good idea, I like it, I like it.“ said
another man, “But I think a different set-
ting would be good, you know. like they
are married and live in New York City
and are in love." A woman interjected,“lt
would be even funnier if they are married
and lived in New York City and are in
love and one is Lutheran and the’other
Methodist." Everybody laughed. “No stereotypes Although i understood why
wait!" exclaimed the ﬁrst man, “l‘ll go
one better. How about ifthe guy is Jewish
and the girl is Catholic?“ Everyone look-

   
 

  
 

 

 

l know I’ll miss the traditions'here at
SUNYA: Telethon for sure, Thursday
nights at Sutters or , W.T.'s, social
gatherings at the library, and so on.
What? You don't care about that at all?
Hmmph—l hope the computer fucks you
up and doesn't even have you listed as be-
ing a student just when you're ready to
pick up your diploma. Or even better, the
registrar. in its efficient manner, notiﬁes
you the day before graduationthat you're
short one credit, forcing you to remain
here another semester. Thejob you had
lined up bites the dust

ed up to the ceiling and then laughed.
They then pondered the endless
possibilities for storylines. One episode
would have the wife knitting the husband
a square yamulke. Another has the wife
secretly taking a Berlitz course in Hebrew
unaware that he is takinga Berlitz course
in Latin. So began a showentitled Bridget
Loves Bernie.
in trying to promote love for fellow
humans, television tripped over its own
liberalness. The sell was too hard. Their
effort to typify every Catholic andJewish
family resulted in relatively boring

was aroused, 1 never watched Bridget
Loves Bernie. Then when l tuned in, it
was only because i thought television was
becoming provocative.

Today T.V. maintains the same views
but portrays them with definitely a more
subtle style. No longer does the plot
revolve around some liberal dogma, but
instead, it revolves around it's characters.
in this way, opinions can be expressed
without offending or alienating segments
of the populace because the person who
holds these opinions is a cute, likeable
character.

certain groups protested the show, the
smarter tactic would have been to ignore
it and let it fade away. Before the public

who are'not, graduating yet, 1 hope you've
gotten ‘a message from this—enjoy it
whileyoucanpyou can't go back and
relive college.

I now..end this with two thoughts: (i
don't want to strain my brain and cause
fires) 1 am obviously not an English major
nor have I ever written a paper this long
that is completely original (not requiring
phony footnotes or forgetting. by acci-
dent of course, to include them where
necessary). Second, those whol have liv-
ed with and .written about, know who
they are and all the circumstances men-

-tioned. if I have embarrassed them, well,
too bad!

For example, Rhoda is Jewish and her
husband is not. Same situation the
Bridget and Bernie found themselves in,
but instead of belaboring the cir-
cumstances, on Rhoda it is accepted.
Gabe Kotter, who is Jewish, has a
Catholic wife; because they are realistic.
it seems that in television, realism comes
with experience and age. HEYII That‘s a
great idea for a new showll There are
these two really aged people who are very
experienced, they're in love and living in
New York City . . . . ..
