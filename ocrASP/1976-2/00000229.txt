The campus at Berkeley—:the largest un—
iversity in California—ts norsy and ﬂooded
with sunshine. Ten years ago when I was ﬁrst
there the university was besieged by police
detachments. Students were ﬁghting for
freedom of speech and the right to oppose the
Vietnam War. Now things are relatively

aceful. Many who once considered street
demonstration of prime Importance have
changed their minds and are now studyingthe
crisis of contemporary capitalism. the social
structure of America, and reading Marx.
Engels, and Lenin. 0n the walls of campus
buildings are posters announcing meetings
and debates on “The Crisis in Spain and Por-
tugal," “Who Owns California'l‘"and "The
Economy of Contemporary America.“

We are at a university club gathering. com-
memorating the l0th anniversary of the
Berkeley riots. The hall is full. Though it is a
balmy day these young men and w'omen'arc
not at the stadium, where the band is blaring.
A documentary film, shot on campus in I965,
is being shown. 0n the screen are policemen
working in pairs throwing students into buses.

After the film there is a discussion. its par-
ticipants as varied as the movement. At the
podium is a gray-headed old man who talks
slowly with a strong accent—«Herbert Mar-
case. He speaks of “inner self-emancipation“
and calls for an end to ideological arguments.
Another orator advocates “permanent revolu-
tion.“ a third focuses on the struggle between
the world of the “south” and the "north." The
Communist Bettina Aptheker[duughter ofthe
Communist historian Herbert Aptheker]
takes the floor. She Is well known at the un-
iversity. where she headed Berkeley‘s free
speech movement. Bettinaspeaks ofthe eman-

s View of  

cipation movement in America. There is stor-
my applause as she leaves.

It is said that a period of relative calm has
arrived in the US But this is a very troubled
culm. The crises of millions unemployed and
galloping inflation have become the people‘s
main anxieties. The workers’ march on
Washington last fall was an imitation of a
similar march during the Thirties. There has
been a rapid increase in “wildcat” strikes, not
sanctioned by union bureaucracy. Negroes.
Puerto Ricans, Indians. Chicanos, and other
national minorities which had been largely
isolated now frequently join in protests.
Within the youth movement major political
and social issues are clearlyintheforefront . ..

We are in New York. This part of Manhat-
tan is not adorned withthe newest skyscrapers
of dark glass and curiously curved planes and
does not glitter with shop windows wlterc, in
whimsical poses. beautifully groomed manne-
quins advertise expensive furs. Here it is gray
and gloomy and there are low houses blacken-
ed by smoke. dingy eating places. warehouses.
and studios. This is 23d St. and here is the
small building ofthe Central Committee ofthe
Communist Party ofthe U.S. Nearby on I9th
St. are the editorial offices of the American
Communist newspaper. The Daily World.

At l’nrty headquarters we talk with the
(ieneral Secretary, Comrade (ius “II”. He
describes the work of the Party since its Con-
gress in Chicago. its preparations for the
presidential campaign. the workers‘ move-
ment, and the daily struggle in the New York
area. We recall a front page news report inth
|.os Angeles 77mm after the Congress in
(‘Iiicago witlithe headline .Aln III/Illl'ttf Young
People. Communists In The US. Gain New
Strong/h.

A deep crisis had developed inthe American _

twa—party system. There is a more signiﬁcant
consensus between rightwing Republicans
and Democrats than between rightists and
liberals within each party. In conservative
circles insistent calls are heard for a more
authoritarian regime, not to limitthe power of
the monopolies in any way but to continue at-
tacks on the rights of workers and to
strengthen every aspect of anti-Communism.

The latest disclosures about the illegal ac-
tivities of the CIA and the FBI reveal the
methods of the Right withinthe governmental
apparatus. The “computerization” of
eavesdropping and spying has now touched
the majority of citizens. Rightists and ti]-
trarightists. closely tied to the military-
industrial complex. advocate the Cold War
and an arms race. Seeking a mass base, they
exploit racism in the interests ofthe “middle
American,“ whom theypromised to protect
from “big government” and “big unions."

Members of the so-called “liberal-wing” in
both parties are a very diverse group. In per-
suit of popularity. they call for a cleanup of
American political life. opposition to cor-
porations. control by Congress over the Ad-
ministration. limitation of the more scan-
dalous corporate machinations. and some
restraint in the arms race. Thus it is obvious
that both parties are divided into opposing
currents. And neither party asa whole can give
the voters answers to the problems that dis-
turb them.

The number of American intellectual ex-
putri at es is growing. I know many members of
the US intelligentsia now in Paris, writers.
artists, journalists, ﬁlm directors, dis-
enchanted with everything. Thcy are now
breaking wrth capitalism~far from that—but

with American capitalist society. V .

Never‘before in America, which Is on the
threshold, of Its Bicentennial, have so many
spoken and .written about its origins. stood in
such long lines at the homes of Georg
Washington at Mt. Vernon and Independence
Hall in Philadelphia, whereindependence was
proclaimed in I776. Many compare the
reasons forthe bourgeois revolution at the end
of the l8th century with the reality of today.
America today is a disillusioned society, glan-
cing back at the past and looking toward the
future with anxiety. ‘
