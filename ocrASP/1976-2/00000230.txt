mendation of $49,009 to' be
{xgoposed appropriation. Andy
human showed atotal disregard for
the committee’s work when he made
the cut. I, for one, believe that Mr.

the budget, but is cutting the'budget
to the bone, and the result. Will have

hit look at the benefits derived

from our funding of intercollegiate
athletics. First is the service and
entertainment outlet that athletics
provides to an entire student body.
Also, ‘ intercollegiate athletics
provides a valuable link to the com-
munity surrounding the university.
lthas helped aid the conttnutng
development of this campus, by
providing us with better name
recognition. When one talks about
strengthening the Alumni Associa-
tion, athletics provides alumni wrth
the opportunity to continue to stay
in contact and to become part of a
visible Alumni Association. Inter-
collegiate athletics. instills pride and
enthusiasm in the student body.
How often can one say that Albany
State students ever showed greater
signs of enthusiasm and spirit than at
an Albany-Siena basketball game?

When you make a commitment to
partake in such an expenditure, you
are obligated tosupport the program

 

toitsfullest growth. Athletics hasen-
joyed fruitful years of growth here at
Albany. It should be allowed to grow
and not be subjected to such a
damaging budget cut.

If Andy Bauman‘s budget cut is
sustained by central council, there
will be no winners—only losers.
Once again students will be denied
the opportunity to enjoy the beneﬁts
derived from a fine athletic program
here on this campus. It‘s about time
that we remember that we are
representatives of the student body.
It's our obligation to provide for the
needs of the student body. Inter-
colleg‘ate athletics is probably one
of the most widely used services here
on this campus. Therefore it makes
no sense to make such a cut. because
athletics doesn‘tjust suffer. We all
suffer because of the total disregard
of the wishes of the student body.

which is obviously inadequate.
Although construction has been the
traditional responsibility of the
state, there is no chance that an
athletic structure will be built by NY
State in the reasonably near future.

l am in favor of funding inter-
collegiate athletics at a level of
$14.50 per student per annum, or
Sl30,000 forthc 1976-47 budget.

The athletic program should have

also be able to raise additional funds A

from use of income.

Student money should serve as‘
many students as possible and the
construction of a ﬁeldhousc via the
AAB surplus would certainly
achieve that goal. AAB money, in
general, should be spent with all
students in mind, and thus spectator
sports such as football, basketball,
and soccer are particularly valuable.

The athletic budget goes to sup--
port on important student need.

The Intcr Collegiate Athletic
Association is the major recipient of
Student Association funding This
group inthc past has had stronglnits
activities from the student body. It is
up tothc president toinsurethat the
funds for this group are effectively
and efﬁciently utilized to provide
continued service to all students.

As for the cutting of the ICA
budget for next year, it is imperative
that before any decision is reached,
that it full rc-cvaluution should be
made by the ICA of it‘s costs. The
purpose would he to minimize costs
while strivingto maintainthe quality
of the activities offered. After such
actions, some form of workable
compromise could then be worked
out between SA and the ICAA for
next year‘s budget.

good Brockport squad. “We knew

Brockpott came right back and led
at the half 6—3.

Brockport continued to pressure
the Danes in the second half and it
paid off as they outscored State 8—
3.

“I couldn‘t have asked anymore
from the kids in terms of attitude,
desire or hustle,” said Fowler. “We
are an improving club and I know it
will be a different ballgame if we
meet up with then- in the ECAC up-
state playoffs," Fowler continued.

Hartwick College was the Dﬂnﬂ‘
next foe and the I976 Albany State
lacrosse team went out and scored
more goals in one game than any
other Albany team before them as
they destroyed Hartwick lS—l.
Albany led from the opening whistle
as attackman Bill Schmohl scored
only 29 seconds into the contest.
From there it was just one big
barrage of goals as nine Albany
players hit the scoring column for
State. Terry Brady led the way with
four goals and four assists. He was
followed by Gary Wooden who had
three goals and two assists, Jay
Kianka with three goals and Bill
Schmohl, Craig Roberts and Anion
Berg, each of whom had two goals.

Coach Fowler was very pleased
with the team‘s play especially in the
first quarter. .

“The ﬁrst quarter was probably
the best quarter of lacrosse we
played all year,“ said Fowler. “We
were super sharp."

Albany was forced to play the
game without the services of Joe

“Moons” Mullins and Kevin Brown

who were casualties ofthc Brockport
gumc.
Albany is next in action Saturday
