next ﬁ've' before ﬁnally succumbing
to LeMoyne in the second game of
Wednesday’s home doubleheader
by a 4—1 score. 4

It began in Brockport. After being
utterly humiliated in the ﬁrst game
by a IS—l margin.the Danes ﬁnally
learned what the word “victory”
meant when they squeaked out a 5—
4 win in the nightcap.

With the score tied 4—4 in that
one, Mike Melzer led off the ﬁnal
frame with a base hit. Pinch runner
MikeMirabella advanced to second
on a succeeding wild pitch and came
around to score on back-to-back
singles by Mike Gamage and Howie
Markowitr. And when Albany
hurler John Dollard slammed the
door in the bottom of the frame.the
Danes had their ﬁrst triumph of the
season. A

In fact. they liked that one so
much, they decided to try it again.
Tangling with powarful Siena last
Tuesday, they managed to come
away with a 7—6 win in a gamethat
really had not quite ended. You see,
the Danes led 7—6 after eight—
thsnks mainly to Jim Wiloughby‘s

three-run homer in the at...»  ~
Then Siena tslll wlee in the
ninth to grab the lead. Albany came

- back to tie in their half, but with two

outs umpire John Dornanico called
thegssne because of darkness. Since
the inning as not completed. the
game reverted‘to the score of the
previous frame, thereby, giving the
Danes the win. Albany coach Bob
Burlingame did not argue. .
With two wins now under their
belts, they Were ready for (shudder)
big. bad Hartwick—s powerhouse in
the East. But in all (shrine to the
Warriors, they never really had an
opportunity to prove their might.
With Albany ahead by a 3—2 score
after ﬁve, down came the rains to
wash out the game and carry Albany
to its third straight victory.
(Willoughby‘s two-run single in the
third proved to be the game-winning

hit).

And that brought on Union in a
game played here Saturday. With
Albany ahead 3—0 after six, the roof
fell in on starter Pual leello in the
seventh. And on his replacement Bob
Kronenberger. Before the dust had
cleared, Union had scored seven
runs on four hits and ﬁve walks to
grab a 7—3 lead.

But the Danes had only begun to
ﬁght. Tallying two times in their half
of the seventh. the hosts camp up
with a ﬁve-run rally in the next in-
ning to pull out the win. John Craig's
one-out single tied the game before
Jeff Breglio’s three-run blast iced it.

Win number four. I
And they‘ll!!! game of

Wednesday's twinbill proved to be

win number ﬁve. The Danes once
again resorted to late-inning heroics
by scoring once in the sixth and once
in the seventh to pull out a dramatic
6—5, come-from-behind victory.
Two walks. a single, and an inﬁeld
error put Danes' starter Dollard in a
2—0 hole in the very ﬁrst inning. Bil
when Willoughby came through
once more with a two-run double in

the home ﬁrst, it was a new

ballgame.

A walk to Craig and a long home
run off the hat of Breglio—his ae-
cond in two games—gave the hosts a
4—2 advantage after three.

But Dollard was struggling. And
in the ﬁfth, LeMoyne nicked himfor
three runs to grab the lead once
more. Asingle by Mahoney, an error
by shortstop Craig, a Gilroysingle, a
Gapski sacrifice ﬂy, and a Barry
double accounted for the scores.

Lemoyne threatened to break the
game wide open in the next frame
when they loaded the has with
nobody out. Only a third-to-home-
to-ﬁrst double play and a ground out
averted disaster. And saved the

me.

In the bottom of the sixth. the
Danes tied it. Breglio started it by
singling to left. Pinch-runner Scott
Demner stole second, moved to third
on an error, and scored on Roger
Plantier‘s line single to center.

in the last of the seventh, victory
was at hand. Paul Nelson opened the
frame with a walk on four pitches by
loser Tom Fletcher. Nelson stole se-
cond and moved to third on a solid
single off the but of pinch-hitter

Larry Humphrey. And when ﬁrst

plate with the winning run.

Five In A Row

That made it ﬁve in a row. Not
losses but wins! But all streaks must
end sometime—as Joe DiMaggio
will tell you. And Albany‘s ended
before they had much of a chance to
savor theirs.

In the second game, LeMoyne
struck in the ﬁrst inning. when Ger-
mano singled off DiLcllo and
Wessinger doubled him in. But the
Danes bounced right back with a
scoreknotting tally of their own in
their half. Nelson wulkcd, stole sc-
cond (again) and scored on Craig‘s
single to center.

But the visitors broke it open in

the fourth. Gilroy's single and
Gapski's double put runnners on se-
cond and third with none out. When
Silvia's attempted squeeze bunt
backﬁred, Gilroy was hung up
between third and home but scored
anyway on Willoughby's errant
throw. A ﬁelder‘s choice grounder to
short (which got no one) and a walk
loaded the bags before Mahoncy's
single and Dil.ello‘s wild pitch
plated the final two runs.

The Danes never threatened us
LcMoync‘s Tim Andi hurled a neat
three-hitter to sew up the victory.

sum With The Slant On Sports?

 

 

Sunday evening at 7:30 pm Cen-
tral Council will meet in special ses-
sion to discuss the future of inter-
collegiate uthlctics on the Albany
campus, and to vote on its proposed
I976—77 budget.

Athletic Finance Committee
(AFC) has approved it proposed
budget of $l49.000; :1 budget which
requires $19,000 to be withdrawn
from the Athletic Advisory Board
Surplus.

Student Association President
Andrew lluumun has refused to con-
sider u budget requiring funds from
the surplus, and has cut the $l9.000
difference from the Administrative
Costs line of the Men‘s Program.
Among the items thus eliminated
are: medical coverage for par-
ticipants, all conference and regional
(ECAC. NCAA) memberships, and
student assistants whosejobs are of a
clerical or managerial nature.

Where is Bauman‘s sense of
responsibility? It would seem that
the SA president has reacted in a
childish manner. merely slashing
dollars and cents in a lump, rather
than taking the time to go through
the budget and come up with a list of
cuts which might just make some
sense.

Not that Bauman has not bad the
time—he has known about the
difference in funds between his and
the committee's for more than two
months. Iauman has repeatedly
been asked to come up with
proposals for Central Council. yet
has refused to do so.

Buumun argues. and rightly so,
that to propose a budget in excess of
the $00,000 which will be generated
for AAB from mandatory student
tax would be irresponsible.
Howavcr. as president of SA. it is his
responsibility to propose the best
budget for every group, based on
funds available, and. like it or not.
the dollars from the surplus are
availnble and have been used for ex—
uctly this purpose during the past
few years.

Suggestions that Baumun propose
u budget including the $19,000, und
explaining to Central Council exact-
ly what the situation is regarding the
surplus. have been ignored.

Apparently. Buumun believes
there is fut somewhere in the budget.
but. like most politicians. refuses to
tell the public about it.

It is election time around these
parts. J'on Levenson, Steve DiMeo.
.Iny Miller. and Mutt Knufmun are
the four announced cundidates for
the SA Presidency who have remuin-
ed in the race.

Below are statements written by
each of the candidates, stating their
positions on intercolleg‘ate athletics
and the surplus. They are unabridg-
ed, have been edited only for gram-
mar. and are printed in the order in
which they were received.

Jon [overseen

I believe that the intercollegiate
athletics program did not deservethe
poor treatment it has received from
this year's Student Assedatlon

government.

I fought ugninst the 525.000 xerox
machine purchase, funded through
monies tukcn from the Athletic Ad-
visory Bourd Surplus, despite the
non-uthletic nature of thc expcn-
diturc.

One of my opponents ubstuincd
on the first vote on the xerox
machine purchase (was it too con-
trovcrsinl) and was absent the sc-
cond time it come up at an cmcrgcn-
cy meeting (all ubscnccs ut cmergcn-
cy meetings are excused). My other
opponent voted in favor of this
ridiculous expenditure.

As fur us the uthlctic budget deficit
(upproximutely $19,000), I out in
favor of solving the problem in the
some manner as in the post—by tuk—
ing the money from the AAB sur-
plus.

That‘s why the money was
collected in the first place, and also
the reason forthe creation ofthcsur-
plus. Certainly this is u better solu-
tion than cutting sports out of the
program.

I've spoken up consistently for
SUNYA‘I spans representatives.
