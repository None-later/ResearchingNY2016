the pogibilities of extending funding

my lack of experience in the present

can only be advantageous to the
students of SUNYA. i do in fact
have a good working experience in

what you‘re independent  that
your opponent is not? I r  ‘
Parker: l‘m independent of the
present SA workings inside‘tﬁn of-
fice of Central Council. I received a
lot of feedback from students at the
university who really don't know
what‘s going on in SA. They don't
care. What they hear is that Central
Council debates back and forth. All
the students care about is that SA
wrll help them out and that they wrll
see something for their student tax
money. I feel that I can work better
with certain people. possible with the
ASP. maybe with WSUA and with
the administrators. coming in with
some new ideas and fresh blood.
Hollander: I decided not to runfor
president because the president. as
most of you know. speaks directlyto
the administration and students. and
doing that takes a lot of working
time away from the president. He's
always concentrating on making
speeches or on forming policy. Since
the vice-president can work more
behind the scenes. he can take care of
many projects. He has more time to
devote to exact projects. instead of
having to answer as the president

does, to administrators and
tidents. ;

i_W3UA/ASP: Do you plan to use
the vice-presidency to augment the
views of the president ordo you plan
to act indepently?

, Parker: Whenever you get two
people together. there will be by»
posing viewpoints, I'm sure,
Hopefully, you can come to some
sort of agreement. as long as two
people still have the ability to com-
municat. I hope that the candidates
who get elected have a concern for

the student body. As long as they
have the students in mind. I hings will
work out. even though some con-
ﬂicts will arise.

Hal/antler: I think I would tryto
augment what the president pushes
foward. I think it‘s important that
you have a president and \iee-
president that agree. When the) do
agree the students and the illi-
ministration will get more eredththtt
in what they do. Opposing \tetv-
points can be taken care ol belting
closed doors. A comprotntsc can he
