Even the harrowing Walter Carlos

 ALA «est _.
from the Recital Hall of the'PAC on

Saturday night. it was as if I were
leaving a great art museum. in which
an unknown old master painting
were displayed. Such was my
wonder at the. mastery of Sergei
Paraj'anov's ﬁlm Shadows of Our
Forgotten Ancestors shoWn as the
last in the series of Prize Inter4
national Cinema.

Tht' ﬁlm is set in the Carpathians
of Russia in the I9th century. The

. people are the Gutuls. a band whose

lives encompass the fears of
medieval society. the independence
of mercantile man. and thejoys and
pains that are the basics of the
human condition. They live on the
borderline of poverty. yet their needs
are few: a roof and side walls tostop
the snow and icy winds. food. com-
panionship. Their loves as well as
their hates are strong. and their
memories great.

Shadows follows the life of Ivan.
his innocence in childhood. his
wonder at adolescence. and his noble
then tragic maturity. He is in love
withMarishku. a beautiful girl whois
the daughter of the man who killed
his father. Like Romeo and Juliet,

their fates are sealed. but as in
Shakespeare's tale, the art is in the
telling. ‘, _ - ._

We are confronted with all the
sights and sounds of these people.
The'camera work is dazzling. Each
frame can be savoured. They retain
the illusion of spontaneity. of
naturalism. yet they must surely
have been laboured over intensely.
We do not merely witness a storm. or
a feast. or a death: we are a part of
them. Thetrackingsbotsare dizzying
in their speed and expansivcr.css.
The close-ups areunaffccted: they
are expressive.

Shadows has surely the ﬁnest
musical score since I’rokoﬁev‘s
music for Alexander Nevsky. Its
mixture of religious chants. folk
music and even jarring atonal music
are all mixed to intensify the visual
experience. Indeed. the I'ilm'sexpan-
siveness harkens hack to Eisenstein.
In such scenes as the funeral proces-
sion across the snowy mountains. it
becomes evident that l’arjanov has
learned his lesson well from the late
Russian master.

I must applaud the PAC for their
wisdom in the creation of this series
and for their good taste in the selec-
tion of lilms.
