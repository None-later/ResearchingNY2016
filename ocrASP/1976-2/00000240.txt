Penn Relay Performances Un-Olympian;
Villanova Dominates Distance Relays

by Ralph Bernstein

PHILADELPHIA (Al’) -—»
Maybe it‘s early. but the times and
distances at the Penn Relays Friday
and Saturday hardly frightened
world ttthlctcs getting ready for the
Olympic (inmes in Montreal this
summer.

There were some good perfor-
mances. but in the main it was an or-.
dinnry meet. dominated as usual in
the distancc relay events by
Villanova. and in the sprints by
’l‘cnncssce‘s Reggie Jones. the
NCAA ZOO-meter champion. Penn
State's Mike Shine also shone.

l’ttul Cummings. 23. is considered
by some the United States' top hope
in the l.500«nietcr event in Mon-
treal. He built a 25-yard lead in thc
backsirctch of the gun lap but ill-
mmt lost as Wilson Wnigwa of
lesas- lil l'aso came thundering out
of the pack.

Waigwa gradually ate tip the long

Cummings lead. brieﬂy headed the
runner of the Beverly Hills Striders.
then lost at the ttipc as the spent
Cummings lunged. Waigwa. who
also was clocked in 3:38.9.said he
started his finishing kick too late.
Villanova performed as expected.
On Friday the Wildcats of coach Jim
Elliott won the distance medley with
Irish Olympian Eamonn Coghlan
finishing some 40 yards in front.
Coghlan did the same job as the
nnchorman on the 6,000~metcr team.
winning by 50 yards. ilc ran t he third
leg of the .3.200-mcter relay. and
gave Mark llelger ll lead the anchor-
man expanded to a 25-yard victory.
Villanova won the 6.000 in |5:03.0
and the 3.200 in 7: 18.0. The t hree vic-
tories gave the Wildcats 59 at the
Penn Relays. since they became a
track power in l955. Host l’cnn with
55% over 82 years is second.
'l'cnncsscc's tillil-mctcr team.
anchored by Jones tied a world

record of |:25.5. when it outrun Ken-
tucky State in the event. That was
the same mark set .luly 2i. I972. by
an Italian National Team at Barlet-
ta. Italy. Jones also anchored a win-
niag Tennessee 400-meter relay
team. and took the lilo-meter dash in
l0.2. while l’hil Olsen‘s 267 feet. 2
inchjuvclin throw made it four firsts
for the volunteers.
