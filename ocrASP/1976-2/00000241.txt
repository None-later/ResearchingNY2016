Council Appropriates

After a stormy nine-hour session.

Central Council voted to up-
propriatc $9800 from the Athletic
Advisory Board Surplus. and added
a $9800 incotne line. to the inter-
collegiate Athletics Budget for l976-

arguments against any appropria-

FSA' VotesCosh'Reboie i
To Meal Plan Students

by llndl Fried ,

The FSA Board of Directors ap-
proved a four per cent cash rebate to
meal plan students in a meeting
Wednesday.

Although a non-profit organiza-
tion. FSA will reach an expected

profit of $300,000 f orthis fiscal year. _

according to corporation president
Stu Klein. Surpluses have been
building up in the corporation over
the last three years.

FSA general manager Norbert
Zahm said the four per cent rebate
figure was arrived at by examination
in general terms of what would be
left over in qund and miscellaneous
business at the end of the year. The
result was approximately $l65.000.
or four per cent of board.

Klein said. “'i‘hcfour per cent was
arrived at by taking the expected
total profit from food service. which
would be about 3295.000." He said.
“We took out ofthat $75.000to pay
for such things as Mohawk Campus
and other program items." 0f the
remainder. $|65.000 will go for
rebates and the balance will be added
to FSA‘s stabilizing cushion.

The FSA Priorities Committee
met Monday to discuss usage of the
excess. Two recommendations were
proposed: cash rebatesto students
ttnd to work something out withncxt
year‘s budget.

Apparently. when drawing up the

l975-l976 budget, the majority of _

last year‘s Board of Directors assum-
ed the intlationarytrend would con-
tinue at its past rate. An 8% per cent
board increase was. after some dis-
sension. voted in,

inflation has since slowed down.
and food prices have fallen. in addi-
tion to this. whereas adecrcase in the
number of students on meal plan was
anticipated. there was an increase.

Guest business. according to
Ztihm. has risen by 50 per cent. and
special functions have increased by
15 per cent.

it was suggested. at the Priorities
meeting. that the money be used to
rttisc food quality. by purchasing
better food. SA Vice President Rick
Mcckler poitttcd out that as food
preparation would remain the same.
the irtcreasc in quality would be
negligible.

A portion ofthe l07b— l077 budget

has been designated for improve-
ment of the quality of next year‘s
food. in way of new kitchen equip-
ment. forinstance. Money is also M
ing allocated for improvement of the
Rathskeliar.

Zaitm said therc were difﬁculties
to be encountered inthe givingofthe
rebates. Of major concern was
whether rebates should be prorated
according to meal plantypc. orgiven
as a flat rate. Other considerations
were the administrative costs in-
volved in mailing 5.500 checks. and
to whom. student or parent. the
rebates should be sent.

“As far as administrative costs.
they're not too much.“ said Klein.

In direct deﬁance of the State
Education Commissioner‘s orders.
SUNYA is now admitting students
into the disputed English and
History Ph. D. programs.

Ewald Nyquist. who in December
directed the university to suspend
admissions because these programs
did not meet up to SED standards.
has becntaken to court bythe SUNY
Board of Trustees to determine if he
has the power to do so.

if SUNY loses. SED attorney
Robert Stone says “Anyone who
entered the programs subsequent to
tie-regulation . . . could not earna
degree from (SUNYA).“

But that‘s been taken care of.

Plans have already been worked
out with SUNY Buffalo for the
newly-admitted students to ﬁnish
their doctoral studies tlterc. if the
court rules in Nyquist's favor.

in a letter to SUNY Chancellor
Ernest Boyer dated March 30.
Emmett Fields talks about this plan:
“in the unlikely event that thelitiga-
tion initiated by SUNY challenging
the validity of the Commissioner's
action is unsuccessful." President
Fields writes. “we have worked out a
contingency plan with SUNY at lluf-
fqu for the granting of degrees to
students admitted to our programs."

This was confirmed by Buffalo‘s
Associate Provost for Graduate

ed ucation. “ We made this agreement
in December." said Murray
Schwartz. “but it was an informal
one (then)."

When asked if Buffalo is the only
other university center involved in
the plan. Schwartz said. “we haven‘t
heard of any other case."

in .the,.same letter. Fields urges
that "no publicity be given to the
plan at this time." an attitude echoed
by SUNYA Vice President for
Research Louis Salkever.

" We don‘t want to publicize that."
he said. when asked about the plan.
"Someone might try to stop us.“

Nyquist. however. claims he has

no such ideas: “We‘re not going to
do anything about that." he said
when reached at home last night.

Nyquist was reluctant to discuss
the issue. and would only confirm
that an injunction is being sought to
prevent SUNY from disobeying his
orders.
. But this decision can only be made
after the State.Supreme Court has
heard both sides. which could take
weeks—or months.

in the meantime. it appears that
the SED is powerlessto act. “Since it
is in court there are no conc'rcte steps
we can take.“ said spokesperson
Byron Conncll. '

SA presidential elndl
Levenson conceded defeat toSte’ve
DiMeo early this morning; melting
an expected runéoff election un-
necessary.  j - I I ‘

After the Votes were counted,
DiMeo with 37 per cent and [even-
son with 33 per cent were faced with
another round of balloting.

From his campaign headquarters

i in the Wellington Hotel. Levenson

said. “Steve DiMeo simply got more
votes."

.ltty Miller ran third with 25 per
cent of the vote. while Matt Kauf~
man trailed the ﬁeld with 5 per cent.

Gary Parker will face DiMeo‘s
running mate. Jeff Hollander. in a
run-off for SA Vice President.
Parker Won a plurality. 85] votes to
Holltlnder‘s 828. but sixty-eight
write-in votes prevented a majority.

bevenson said. “Rather than go-
ing through along. drawn-out cant-
paigning process. whére personality
would be the only topic. I feel my
campaign proved sufﬁcient to bring
out previously ignored but impor-
tant issues.“

About the campaign. DiMeo said.
“The most important issue was
credibility.“ He said. “i think SAwill
maintain credibility and l'm op-

Nursing Reprieve Given No Hope

by Daniel Gaines

SUNYA‘s plan for cuts and
rcallocutions was approved this
week by SUNY Chancellor Ernest
Boyer. as expected. The approval.
given in a letter to President Emmett
Fields. quashed last-minute hopes
that the politiculi y popular School of
Nursing would by spared.

lioycr‘s decision means that there
will be no change in Fields‘ Task
Force plun. Barring unexpected
developments. the plan will
eliminate seven doctoral. five
master's and eight bachelor‘s

programs at SUNYA.

Boycr‘s decision came later titan
expected. causing some to speculate
that Nursing might be saved."lnthis
educational system. the longer
things take. " said Assembly Higher
Education Committee spokesman
lra Rubenstein. "the more optimistic
they look."

“I think it‘s wrong." said Landes
about the Nursing cut. but he in-
dicated that Boyer had felt that to
stay at Albany the program needcda
graduate component. and for that
there wasn't enough money.

UUP Contract Center Of Rehiring Controversy

by Paul Rosenthal

the United University Professions'
contract with SUNY and New York
State provides for “rcemployment in
the same or similar position” for
those rctrencltcd because of financial
conditions.

That clause and the SUNYA nd~
tninistrtttion‘s alleged misinterpreta-
tion are at the center of a controversy
lrethcu UUP and the tid-
tninistrntors.

Albttny UUP President Bruce
Marsh cited what lte called. “two
scpcrttle articles [of the contract]
which are frequently confused." One
calls for “special consideration" for
placement of retrencited employees.

Another article of the agreement
states that those employees retrench-
ed nntl not otherwise workingwithin
SUNY “shall be offered reemploy~
meat."

What determines “the same or
similar position" is what remains to
be decided.

Most Qualiﬁed

SUNYA Personnel Director Leon
Calhoun maintains that his job is to
hire the most qualified person
available. He said. “We have to
tntttch up u professor‘s specialty with
the skills a vacancy requires."

Calhoun ntnde reference to the
part of u contract article which calls
for special consideration. “provided

that a suitable position for which the
employee is otherwise qualiﬁed is
available."

(inry Westervclt. u member of
Albany UUP‘s Article 35 Com-
ntittce. says tltnt the university had
previously ackttowlcdgcd an in-
dividuul‘s abilities by originally hir-
ing them. lie feels that the ad-
rninistration's interpretation of
“same or similar“ is too narrow.

Too Selective

Mar: .1 agreed that the rchiring of
rctrenched employees has been too
selective. Hesnid. "The management
has the view that they can be very
specific." UUP‘s’position is that a
professor sltouid be hired to teach

courses in his general field. “even if
it‘s in a different dcpnnment."
Cttlhoun characterizes the currcrtt
rehiring policy as fair. He said
rctrenched employees ttrc informed

.of vacancies fifteen days before the

position is publicly advertised. He
claims. “Except for one or two. the
rctrcnched have not , ' the
experience in specialized areas."
Proper Deﬁnition
Westervelt says it is SUNY Cen-
tral‘s responsibility to arrive at it
proper definition for “special cott-
sidcrution.“ He feels it is the “ethical
and lcgttl obligation“ of the ad-
ministrtttion to rehire retrenched
employees wherever possible.

L'mdcs didn't think the legislature
should intervene on behalf of Nur-
sing. “This is not a pattern." he said.
“the unversity [SUNY] has been
responsive to legislative feeling."

Boyer said in his letter that
“SUN Y‘s ttetwork of nursing educa-
tion programs in conjunction with
other higher education institutions
will be adequate to meet the present
and emerging needs of the profes-
ston.“

SUNYA‘s Nursing program
believes administrators have “failed
to recognize the role of the bac-
cnluriate nurse in our society," ac-
cording to Anne Rudolph. an
Associate Professor.

Boyer‘s confirmation of the plan
for SUNYA will be followed by
allocations decisions by Fields
towards the “public policy“ mission
for the school. This summer. a ﬁrst
draft of a “mission study" will be
released for comment ttnd to
stimulate university-wide discussion
