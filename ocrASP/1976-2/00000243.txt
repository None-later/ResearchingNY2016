Alumni Quad Burglary

the room both the screen and inner
window were raised nearly 3 feet.

Although incidents similar to this
are not uncommon at SUNYA. as
the University Police monthly crime
report indicates. this was unusual
because the victim‘s room was still
locked when he discovered the
perpetrators. This means they either
scaled the outside wall. or used a
ladder to enter through an unlocked
window.

Director of Security James
Williams said.“This isthcfirst time I
have lteard of ti case like this."

Williams said that even if
reasonable care and precaution are
taken. “You can do nothing to pre-
vent it [burglary]. A determined thief
can get into any building“

Not Enough Patrolling

When asked if University Police
satisfactorily patrol Alumni Quad,
Williams said that it isn‘t checked
often enough to suit him. “However
we don‘t have any additional of-
ﬁcers."

According to Williams.the only
wayto increase downtown security IS.
to take ofﬁcers away from the up-
town campus. This is not a viable
alternative because security handles
more problems in one night on the
uptown campus than in two weeks
downtown.

A survey of Adirondack Moun-

were highly acidic. and 90 percent of
those lakes were devoid of ﬁshlife.

A similar survey conducted in the
l930‘s showed 4 percent ofthe lakes
to be devoid of fish or with a high
acid content. thescientists reported.

“It is certainly a serious threat to
some species.“ Prof. F. Harvey
Pough said Wednesday. “The future
of the spotted salamanders appears
bleak. and their problems with acid
precipitation may well be shared by
other species of amphibians that
reproduce in temporary ponds. .

“Acid precipitation kills them in
the embryonic period of develop-
ment.“ Pough said. “What happens
is their eggs never hatch.“ l’ough
said the scientists do not know how
the acid precipitation destroys the
eggs.

Paciﬁc news service reports that
the ruling has been handed down by
a three-judge Federal panel in
Oakland. The suit was ﬁled by
women arrested on prostitution
charges who complained that hun-
dreds of women, but virtually no
men. were being arrested under
California's Anti-Prostitution
statute.

Alameda County Public Defender
Michael Millman used Oakland
statistics during l973—74 to show
how systematic bias apparently
worked against women: Duringthat
two year period, I448 females were
arrested. compared to only 59 male
customers— even though both the
purchasers as well assellers of sexual
favors are equally “guilty” under
California Law.

Police Departments will now be
required to arrest roughly an equal
number of men and women under
provisions of the state's anti-
prostitution statute.
