(The 

 

models; boys need a father, or a father ﬁgure. whom
they can striveto emulate; girls also have the same needs
for role models. And what are heroes if not role models
for a country. a nation. a world? These needs and
methods for satisfying them are not new. though the
modern statement employs contmporary psychological
language.

Among the Romans there was what might be called a
“Hall of Fame“ of such heroes. Some. like Romulus.
wcrc legendary. Others were genuine historical ﬁgures
to whose name so many legends had become attached as
to make them almost unrecognizable as authentic
human beings. Probably most of the legends had simply
grown over the course of centuries in the same way in
which a tiny suspicion too often becomes a juicy bit of
gossip.

It is also probable that a certain amount of fabrica-
tion was consciously engaged in to point out amoral.

In this day and age we hear a great deal about role

 

Classicaiilo“F¢ '

ethical. patriotic. or. better still. both together. and thus
provide suitable material for the education of the
young. For this purpose it made little difference whether
the hero was legendary. historical. or historical with a
dash of added “seasoning”. From the writings of Cicero
and others there is ample evidence that such edifying
stories were used by parents and teachers toinstructthe
younger generation.

One of the earliest of these ﬁgures is the first Brutus.
who is credited with a major role in driving out the last
of the Etruscan kings and establishing the Roman
republic. Perhaps as an identifyable personality he
never existed at all. but beyond a doubt at some point in
their early history the Romans rejected Etruscan
hegemony and established what came to be known as
the republic. Endowed with theappropriate virtues. this
Brutus must have inspired many a Roman boy with the
desired attitudes towards patriotism and manliness.

And what hero led the armies of the American
colonies to throw all foreign domination and establish
the republic? George Washington. of course. There is no
question about the historical existence of George
Washington. But have you ever heard the story of the
cherry tree“! Do you believe it? Becareful. The story was
invented by a minister. Mason L. Weems(l759-l825).
often called Parson Weems. and included in his
biography of Washington. Parson chms was very in-
terested in teaching young Americans both honestyand
patriotism. If this one example is not enough for you.
think of the anecdotes you have heard about Abraham
Lincoln. Some of them may well be true. But all?

The truly historical Iigure of Marcus Brutus. one of
the conspirators who slew Julius Caesar. claimed dos-l
cent from the earlier Brutus. and scemsto have believed
that he was replaying the role of his illustrious ancestor
in slaying a tyrant and restoring republican govern-
ment. We know how deluded he was.

Not every Roman lady did nothing but spin and
weave and tend to her household chores. There is the
thrilling story of Cloelia. who. held hostage by Lars
Porsenna of Clusium. escaped fromthc Etruscan camp
through her own daring and returned to Rome.
Remember that during our revolution there were
American heroines more daringthan Betsy Ross. Have
you heard of Molly Pitcher. for example? Ifnot. get out
your American history book and start reading.

Champion. give a “cocobut” (which '

by Lon Levin

Unless you have cable television in
the tri-cily area. you cannot rccciveu
uniquely funny program called
NBC‘s Saturday Night. Too bad:
you‘re missing a creative weekly
production that usually will stop at
nothing to gct laughs. including
death. sex. and toilets. Perhaps the
Albany area‘s programming ex-
ccutivcs believe this show. which is
aired ul ll:30 on Saturday nights. to
be much too controversial for the
general viewing public. It is good to
know that these policies are consis-
tent throughoul the entire program-
ming ‘culcndur. Example—
Professional Wrestling. “:00 Sun-
day morning. Just in time for the
kids to watch.

Every Sunday. for their entertain-
ment pleasure. men. women and
Children of all ages watch people
destroy each other‘s bodies within
the roped-oil ring. There is no sub—
stantial evidence that can directly
correlate violence in the media with
violence in our society. However. I
do know that my brother used to
beat me up using. "elbow smashes".
“body slams". and “eye gougcs“just
like he Icurncd on 'l'.V. Only on T.V..
it just looked real.

Admittedly. to watch now is a fun
experience. The positions and holds
look like a slupslick Joy ril'Scx. Sec-
ing Bobo Brazil. the American

     
         

is essentially a head to head smash.
wherein the smasher: Wn’thes in pain
and smasher just develops a
forehead callous) is laughable. Of
course. I know the whole fight is
staged.

The drama is simply black and
whitce—thc good are good and the
bud have no tccth. Everyone who
ﬁghts is an ethnic avenger. Each
American ethnic minority has
someone to identify with. There‘s
Ivan Putski. Bruno Samartino.
Pcdi‘oWMoralcs. Ivan Koloff and
Haystucks Calhoun for the
overweight people. My favorite
character is The Grand Wilard. the
evil manager who hurls ethnic slurs
at the good guys before each match.
This serves to clearly delineate the
sides so the audience knoWs who to
cheer whcnthe hero smashcsthc l‘uce
of an cvildocr.

As stated before. there is no hard
evidence to show that this type of
program affects certain people's
violcnl inclinations. especially
children's. I question the Sunday
morning lime slot bccausc after
watching “body smashes" and
“cocobuls” and clhnic musclcnlcnt
in lights and World Champion
Bruno Sumartino destroying evil
with physical violence. I uscd to ask
my brother. “Is it rcal‘f‘.

Tune in Ilt‘.\‘l \I't't'A’.
