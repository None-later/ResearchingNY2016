worked. _ out positions with the
' cameraman, (it was My Boley!) and was
' onthe air, ten minutes later, live, with a

“Neighborhoods” feature report.

Just as a new conﬁdence began to flow
through her veins, the intern‘s thoughts
were broken by Boley's voice, exclaiming,
“Jesus Christ!”

They had arrived at the Dunn
Memorial Bridge. The intern looked up
to see an old white Ford driven up an em-
bankment to a forty-ﬁve degree angle,
one wheel hanging over the guardrail of
an exit ramp. The metallic light of dusk
and the unnatural position of the car
changed reality to the land of melting
clocks.

Getting out of the car, an Albany cop
broke the interns daze with intimidation.

“Hey YOUI” he yelled, _"Are you
news?"

The intern yelled hack “Yeah!” a little
too confidently. and said to Boley in a
shaky voice. “oh shit.“

The cop was directing rush hour traffic
around the spectacle. Steam poured from
his mouth and nose as he exhaled. The
biting wind made the cold almost un-
bearable.

The Newswatch l3 team was in action.
Boley began taking footage of the car
while the intern questioned a cop sitting
in a patrol car a few feet away.

Her Inoutlt. almost too cold to be
malleable. the intern asked. "Anybody in—
jured'!“

'l‘he cop ansucred. “We don‘t know.“

“Where‘s the driver of the car?"

"We don‘t know.“

“Did you call motor vehicle for iden-
tiﬁeation?"

This question seemed to impress the
cop as brilliant. His expression changed,
and he gave the intern the name and ad-
dress of the owner of the car.

“We received a call at 3:57 that the car
was here.“ he explained, “but the driver
apparently left the scene. Looks like
drunken driving to me. Call divisiontwo
later this evening. We may have an arrest
by then.

The intern joined Boley by the Ford.
He wastaking shots ofthe longdrop from
the bridge to the ice covered Hudson
River; the plunge that car and driver
could so easily have made. The sound of
bumpers hitting bumpers grabbed their
attention. They ran towards three cars a
few feet away from the exit ramp.

The cop directing traffic yelled dis-
gustcdly. “Is that another accident?"

Boley yelled with a smile. "Yeah!"

The cop was angry until he reached the
accident (only dented fenders) and lloley
turned the camera on him. The cop‘s
large. angry frame straightened up and he
treated us with a big smile. The intern
thought of the kids at the Cohoes Youth
Center.

Remembering deadline, Boley and the
intern ran back to the car and packed the
camera equipment as quickly as possible.

llack at the newsroom and the race was
on. 5:4l. 'l'he intern ran to a typewriter
and pounded out the copy as fast as she
could. lloley went to the editing room.
The intern joined him at 5:49 with one
minute of copy in her hand. Valentine was

edited, including footage of the internin-

terviewing the cop. (“Ah. you deserve it '

for freezing your-ass oil, if nothingelse.“)

Boley opened the door and yelled to
Valentine. “OK , you can take it straight
from here.“ ‘

At about 6:15, the intern ﬁxed her eyes
on one of the four televisions. She watch-
ed the small box turn out blue-light im-
ages of the old Ford; of herself inter-
viewing an Albany cop, scribbling in a
notebook; shots of the drop from the

“He has to know any present medica-

suddenly turns and goesto wherethc doc-

Then points to a twin of t he capsule lying
before him. “Tet razinc," she repeats after
spelling the word out. The doctor reads
the information in the book.

“20 cc‘s of morphine“ he calls to the
nurse.

She rolls up Rollie‘s left sleeve.

Suddenly Dr. Reynolds. Rollie‘s physi-
cian, appears out of the white—drapery
sea. The ﬂash of the silver stethescope.
His hand massages Rollic‘s throat.

“Cancel the morphine, nurse.“

Reynold‘s face is flushed with anger as

The resident mumbles something un-

“l'm goingto give you an injection and
then'l want you to rest here for about a
half hour. Call my office in the morning
and get an early appointment and I‘ll
check you over there. See you

Time is back in place. Hands on the
clock move. Soon we are walking slowly
past the little red welts now mirrored on
the sidewalk. The insistent scream of an
ambulance grows louder as we pull away
from the curb. The waiting rcd neon
burns brightly in the rear—view mirror.
