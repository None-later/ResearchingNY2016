Batmen Win 5-4 0n Buloer‘s Hit

by Mike Plekmld

Pete Bulger‘s pinch hit. ground
single up the middle inthe bottom of
the twelfth inning drive in Jim
Willoughby and lifted the Great
Danes‘ varsity baseball teamtoa 5——
4. come-from-behind victory.
Wednesday. over the Plattsburgh
Cardinals.

Willoughby started the inning by
drawing a walk off loser Tom Jenks.
A Jeff Bregliosae bunt moved him to
second where he came around to
score on Bulger‘s hit.

The victory brought the Danes‘
spring record to 6——9 and left their
SUNYAC slate at 5—7 forthe‘75—
'76 season.

Bulger. a sophomore who usually
pitches when not winning ball
games. was sent in to bat for DH
Mike Mclzcr in the last of the
twelfth. With the count at one ball,
two strikes. liulger connected on the
next pitch and sent a grounder to the
rigltt side of the mound and into
centerficld for the winning game.

“It was a non—breaking slider: a
real fat pitch.“ he explained.

But if it hadn‘t been for his team-

mates‘ four-run rally to tie the game
in the last of the eighth. he never
would have gotten a chance to be a
hero.

With l’lattsburgh holding a 4—0
lead. Paul Nelson led off the home
eighth with a walk off Wally
Vanderhoff. Suddenly, Nelson
broke for second and ended up on
third when catcher Martinthrewthe
ball into ccnterﬁeld.

The play seemed to spark the
Danes. John Craig. who really has
been swinging a hot bat oflate. then
followed with a line single over
short. and Albany had its ﬁrst run of
the afternoon. One out later. Breglio
doubled and nowthe score was 4—2.

Jeff Silverman. the team's batting
leader. singled to put runners at ﬁrst
and third before disaster struck.
Pinch runner Scott Demner was cut

down trying to swipe second and it I

appeared as if the rally would be
over.

But Howie Mttrkowitzsingled for
the third run——Jenks replaced
Vandcrhoff here-"and John Zanella
was hit with a pitch. Roger Planticr
then singled to load the bases and

Mike Mirabella walked to force in
the tying run.

Albany starter Paul DiLello had
hurled the ﬁrst five and was charged
with three of the visitors‘ runs ——two
coming on a two-run homer off the
but of Chuck Borsavage in the
fourth. A wild pitch in the next in-
ning plated the other.

John Dollard took over the
mound chores in the sixth and was
greeted rudely. A base on balls (his
first of two) and a solid double by
Borsavage gave Dollard a jolt. but
the junior righthander then settled
down.

He did so by retiring the side in
order in the seventh. eighth. ninth.
and eleventh frames while allowing
just one single over that stretch. His
only jam came in the twelfth.

A walk and stolen base put a man
on second with none out. Then an
attempted sacrifice resulted in a
putout at third. before another sacv

man in scoring position. Only a ﬁne

Many Myskania Ballots Ignored

by David Winzelberg

Ballot counters in last week‘s stu-
dent clcctions have reported a major
irregularity in the vote tallying for
Myskttnitt candidates.

Ellen Deutschman. who counted
some Myskania ballots. said that the
ballot sheets wcrctbrown into the air
in the middle ofthc counting session

early Friday morning.

Dcuischman said that only one
out of every seven ballots were
tallied and those were multiplied by
seven. After.they were burned. She
said. "ll it‘s goinglo bean clection.it
should he run right. They should
count all the ballots.“

Ira liit'nbaunt. Myskania member
and a justice in the SA Supreme
Court. admitted that the election
irregularity did take place. He said
that all the ballots weren‘t included
in the tally “so we didn't have tostay
up all night counting ballots.“

Myskania member and SA
Supreme Coun justice Bob O‘Con-
nor denied that the vote counting
took placc as described. When asked
if all Myskania ballots were counted.
O‘Connorsaid. “I certainly hopcso.“

O‘Connor. President ofthe class of
1976. said. “The counting was done
according to the Election
Regulatory Act.“

According to Birnbaum. O‘Con-
nor and Brent'Kigncr were counting
Myskania ballots after he ltad left
the room. Kigner said. “We felt it
was alright to be 99 per cent correct."

Normally Counted

Another vote counter. Elizabeth
Eves. alsv denies any irregularities
took place. She said that the votes
“were countedjust the way they nor-
mally do it.“ lives said that thercwas
no evidence of papers thrown up in
the air. everything was legit."

SA President and Myskania
member Andy liauman said. "i
heard of the possibility of doing it
[random counting] Thursday night.
but i said you can't estimate [the
totals].“

I976 Myskania Chairman Jerry
Albrecht said that no decision by
Myskania as a whole was involved in
any election irregularities. He said.
“I‘m disappointed if it was actually
done"

Election Commissioner Neil

O‘Connor said. “I heard rumors
about this.“ He explained that
Myskania was responsible for their
own election. He said. “lfthey want
to run it in that manner that's their
perogative." he added. “i can't tell
them [Myskania] what to do."

Myskania member Dave Coync
said. “I‘m appalled by the laziness
and stupidity.“ He felt that if more
Myskania members had helped in
the ballot counting. then the un-
reasonable burden put on the
counters that prompted the
irregularity would have been lessen-
edu Coync didn‘t- feel thatrthe elee
tion sampling was done maliciously.

Honor Society

society that preceded the present
Student Association. Thirteen
members are elected tothe organiza-
tion each year.

Dcutschman. who reported llte
alleged wrong-doing. said "It‘s sup-
posed to be an honor society. they
shouldn‘t be fucking around with the
ballots.“ Sltc added. “the wltolc
thing is a joke.“

Run-oil elections for SA Vice

I’atkcr sees his unlatniliarity with
SA as an advantage.

"Current dissatisfaction attd lric-

is primarily caused by it‘s
homogeneity." said Parker.

Ilollandcr's campaign emphasilcs
his experience on Ccntrttl Council

President-Elect Di Mco sized up
the candidates as follows: “i think

“l‘nt happy that Steve won." said

Some controversy lutd arisen as to

According to Parker. Hollander

to concede the election there would

Jon Levenson was denied permis-
sion last night by the Student
Association Supreme Court to re-
enter the run-off race for SA presi-
dent

in a hastily called meeting of the
court. Justices Vicki Kurtzman. lra
Birnbaum. Robert O‘Connor and
Stuart Bondell ruled that Levenson
did validly withdraw from the race
and that there will be no run-off.

Justice Stanley Shapiro held the
only dissentittg opinion. statingtbat
any withdrawal from an election
must be made formally. in writing.
with the candidate‘s signature.

“I accept theirdecision.“Levenson
said when informed of the court‘s
ruling. “although I don‘t necessarily
agree with the logic they used to
arrive at that decision."

The controversy arose cttrly Mon-
day afternoon. after SA president
Andy Bauman and Election Com-
missioner Ncil O‘Connor refused to
accept l.cvenson‘s written statement
declaring his entry into the run-off.
They claimed he had already given
verbal notice of his withdrawal Fri-
day morning.

Di Meo said of Levenson‘s renew-
ed bid for election. “1 think it's one of
the lowest things anyone could ever
do." '

Levcnson said his initial thoughts
of concession were under mistaken
impressions. “I thought maybe we
could avoid a run-off and have a
president do a good job." he said.

Levenson‘s decision to reactivate
his campaign was based on Di Mco‘s
alleged “making deals.“

l.cvcnson claims that DiMco
offered the position of SA Con-
troller to Vice Presidential candidate
Gary Parker. if Parker withdrew
front the election. Parker faces a run-

Parker says Hollander used

offer was coming from DiMco.

Hollander told WSUA News‘

and Thursday.

Parker says he declined any offers
for a position in return for his drop-
ping out of the race. He said. “l‘m
sure Steve will try anything to get
Jeff into ofﬁce."

DiMco said he did offer Parker
thejob, but was not interested in in-
suring Hollander‘s election. He said.
“i didn't think there was anything
wrong with it at all.“ He says he has
respect for Parker and will still cott-
sider offering him the post if he is
defeated this week.

Levenson told O'Connor Friday
that he was nolonger runningfor the
presidency. He claims that O‘Con-
nor gave the impression that he
would no longer serve as Elections
Commissioner. O‘Connor is. in fact.
still serving. but admits he is no
longer really involved.

Jon Lafayette. O'Connor‘s elec-
tion assistant. told Levenson that a
written statement was necessary
whether or not he chose to pursue
election in the run-off. No written
concession was submitted.

ltauman said that since SA‘s clec-
tion rules do not specifically call for
a written concession. an oral
withdrawal is adequate. He told
Levcnson to “bring it to the [SA]
Supreme Court and challenge it.“

O‘Connor said it was his decision
not to let Levenson run against
Di Men in a run-off set for this week.
He called the attempt to reenter the
election "a shithead thing to do."

l.cvcnson then brought his case
against O‘Connor before the SA
Supreme Court. where it was ruled
that:

v-A withdrawal from a run-off
election does not necessarily have to
he in writing. although a written
withdrawal is preferable.

~A written withdrawal cannot be
reconsidered.

 A clear oral withdrawal cannot
be withdrawn.

An oral withdrawal can be
clarified if it is unclear within a
reasonable period of tinte.

Jonathan l.cvcnson did
withdraw validly from the run-off
election and the elections should not
be rc-instated.

Although l.cvcnson felt that the
decision ol the court was unfairlyin-
lltlcnccd by the do/cn or so current
members of SA who appeared as
“interested parties.“ he admitted llllll
“it's a decision Hi just have to live
with."

When asked about his future with
SA. lctcoson replied: “Well. sinch
hutcu't been uttered the controller‘s
job or a SASli tlclcgatc's seal. 1
gut-ts I'll just sit- haci. and enjoy my
senior year "
