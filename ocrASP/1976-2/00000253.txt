einberg explained that com-
edia‘ns are forced to deal with what
the audience knows. The publicity
surrounding Watergate had made
people aware of political events. and
at that time, Steinberg had the
freedom to do political satire for a
mass audience.
1 .“It's too dated now to do
Watergate. So i lost my favorite
hour —the act had gone into a
new area.

“What was exciting was that l was‘
doing it while the event was happen-
ing. while Nixon was on television in
that summer of Watergate.

was due to appear on the cover of
Newsweek the week Nixon resigned.
Nixon bumped him off the cover.
“Ah the ﬁnal irony. 'Here i was
making a living off the man. and
God punished me." said Steinberg
who believes in “some form .of
something mysterious."
‘- ‘g‘l was never religious in my rab-
binical background. It's a mistake
that's always made. ljust did it to get
out of town and along the way i
happened to pick up; some good
habits. . .Now I find i like the
traditions of Judaism tremendous-

Three respected architects and six
student apprentices have spent the
last three weeks constructing a pro-
jea that isn't worth much—and
they‘re damn proud of it. '

As part of a seven
credit course in
architectural design
offered at Rensselaer
Polytechnic institute.
Professor Martin Pawley is having
his students build a garbage house.

The walls are made of steel earl
and glass bottles which are cemented
with mortar. The roof is supported
by trusses composed of newsprint
cores with bottlenecks serving as
joints, and discarded metal strap-
ping to hand them together. The ex-
terior roof is sulfur coated card-

board. ‘ .
The structure is being built at the

top of a hill located behind the RPI_
Field House. The land was given by
the school to be used for the experi-
ment which includes plans for I
more-than- willing faculty member to
move in for a while.

As far as houses go. the $600 price
tag for materials including a 17 by 34
foot concrete slab for the ﬂoor and
sheet rock for the interior walls.
make this experiment in low-cost
housing appear very successful.

This is the fifth time Pawley has
designed and supervised a dwelling
which implements consumer waste
as building materials.

“People have done things like
shove beer cans into walls for years,“
said the English architect, “This is
the ﬁrst time it’s being done
systematically."

Smiling as he gazes at rows of
cemented rims gleaming in the sun,

the Miller Company who donated
them. is presently [involved in a
recycling drive. Although he is
grateful forthe'eans Pswieysays that
his group is not concerned with
recycling but with secondary use.
Primarily, Pawley praises secon-
dary use because it provides good yet
cheap building materials. He men-
tioned that opposed to recycling. no
energy is spent remaking waste. into
something that can be reused.

When questioned about the
feasibility of garbage as building
material Pawley. whose newly
published book is entitled Garbage
Housing, asked “Did you know that
a 48 ounce bottle of. what is it called?
. . . the Crowd Pleaser can withs-
tand the stress of 10,000 pounds?"

“It was intended. us part of the ex-

said Puwley.

teaches architectural history at RPl;
she is busy taking pictures inside the

pig and is willing to live in the gar-
bage house for a minimum of six
months.

In order to live there. Crouch is
willing to pay to be hooked up to
drainage. electricity, gas and
telephone. According to Pawley it
shouldn‘t cost more than $2000.
