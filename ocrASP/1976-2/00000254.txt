A Malibu, California, group
called “CounteréCampaign '76“ is
running “Nobody” for President.

The group‘s co-founder Victor
Roman explains he decidedto head
up a national campaign'for nobody
since 49 percent of the voting age

"if; \t ‘

population inthe l972 election failed
or refused to go to the polls. In
Koman‘s View. all these people voted
for nobody.

Counter-Campaign ‘76 is spon-
soring a series of radio spotsthat say
in part: “Last year, nobody lowered

 

your taxes. Nobody ﬂopped. in-V
flation‘s rise. Nobody' ended the
spiraling crime rate. This, year.
return the favor—vote for nobody.
In our bicentennial year. the choice
is clear—«nobody deserVes your vote.

RE-SLAVED
Fundraisers for 40 persons

arrested by‘ Los Angeles Police at an
alleged “Slave Auction” two weeks
ago say their money-raising event
will be another “Slave Auction.”

‘The sponsors have already applied
for a permit from the Los Angeles
Fire Department. and say they were
told that the harnessess and whips
allegedly used on the slaves must be
ﬂameproof. They have also been
told that the slaves must be chained
in such a way they can break loose
and run in case of a ﬁre.

L. A. Police made no comment on
plans for the second slave auction.

Gerry Locklear of Sprindield,
Oregon. has launched a statewide
crusade to place “None of. the

Above" on the ballot In all general -

elections.

This would give the voters a
chance to reject all candidates if the
level of competency doesn't meet
their standards.

Under the proposal, voters are
given a specific option of rejecting all
candidates for an ofﬁce. If “None of
the Above” receives a plurality of
votes in any race. then the office is
declared vacant.

A new election must be called by
the Secretary of State within 90 days.
And none of the candidates rejected
the first time around can be on the
ballot the second time.
