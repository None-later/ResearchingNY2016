“Details oi I Sunset and Other Stories" by VIedrnir Nabokov, MeGraw-Hiii, 1910. 110 pg!-

by Stephen Elsenman

Recollections. contrivances.

dreams, griefs, and giadnesses: these
elements are all at work in the best of
fiction. and the writer who findsthe
proper balance of these elements
achieves expressive clarity (that
singular vision that accompanies the
best of art). The task of the writer is
here akin to the task of the
translator. He must translate the
elemental thoughts into symbols
and then into words on the printed
page.
Vladimir Nabokov is a brilliant
linguist in the translation of the
“language of symbol" into literary
form. In his novels. Lolita. I’nin,
The Defense. Ada and others.
Nabokov‘s characters and their
situations (often highly improbable)
come alive. demanding the reader to
see far beyond the events described
in the novel. Short stories are often
more difficult to create. They de-
mand greater clarity. and impose
strict limits of space on the writer.

The stories in Details of 0 Sunset.
culled from Nabokov‘s early Rus-
sian emigre works. are gems. These
combinations of wit. irony. and
pathos, are fine examples of the
gains to be found in a writer's self-
imposed discipline.

Nabokov‘s use of ironical twists is
everywhere apparent. Whenintheti-
tlc story. the protagonist. Mark. is
suddenly struck and killed by a pass-
ing troliy. before receiving word of
the desertion of his fiance in favor of
another man. we are struck both by
the tragedy and by the real comedy
of the situation.

Here is a man.dcliriously happy
in the other-worldly love of woman.
killed by the most mundane of
mechanical devices. This. moments
before he was to be destroyed by a

    

different enemy: grief. crouched in
the form of a fickle woman. When. in
the last moments. Mark calls out for
his love. wondering why she is not by
his side. our mood changes abruptly:
the all encompassing power of love
shows its tragic side.

Yet the reader is not left with a
feeling of despair. He is instead ex-
hilaratcd. for the loss that we
witness is balanced by our apprehen-
sion of a life made worthwhile by
nature of its intensity. It is an affir-
mation of life.

in “The Return of Churb." we are
once again confronted bythe subtle-
ty of the line dividing tragedy from
comedy. ()n honeymoon. a young
bride Is killed bytouching a live wire.
In order to purge his grief and
crystalizc his memories. the husband
must retrace the young couple‘s
movements. He even hires a
prostitute to stay with him in the
young couple‘s ﬁrst honeymoon
suite. He does not have intercourse

- table. and the

with her. but merely wants her to
help him feel his lost wife‘s presence.

The husband‘s pilgrimage
becomes a nightmare yet it is also
funny. The opposition of the purity
of his love against the sordidness of
the prostitute. and the manner of his
widow‘s death are intensely black
comic. Nabokov has stripped away
rationality. There is no explaining
this story. except to say that it is a
reﬂection of the irrationality of
tragic emotion.

Several of these stories are mere
sketches. It is the tightness and
clarity of the images that sustains
them. In "A Guide to Berlin." the
narrator. seated in a pub. glances at
at an adjoining room. He sees a child
regarding a pool table.

He Will renwmher the billiard
mat/tats evening
visitor who used to draw back his
sharp white elbow and hit the ball
with his cue. . .

"I t‘tlti'! understand what you see
down there, " stirs myfrieml. turning
back toward me.

rer'nllet'liunt.

The many layers of meaning reel
in our heads as we contetnplate this
last simple statement. What is the
relation of the narrator to the boy,
when in years hence. his observation
will itself be a recollection“! The
reader is left on very fragile ground.
His perceptions are all relative; heis
haunted by the unrelenting sagacity
of memory.

Vladimir Nabokov is an author
whose imaginative powers never fail
to astound. These stories are
fascinating and entertaining. They
reveal Nabokov's heightened
perceptions andvsharp wit.
