_ In the fourth, period of Saturday.
night’s nme. the Nets stayed in con-

trol mainly by getting second and
third shots with regularity. In a span

' of four minutes of the final quarter.

New York scored six straight baskets
on rebounded shots. four by Erving.

Denver had rallied from deficits of
at least nine points in the ﬁrst three
quarters to make a game of it toward
the end; The Nuggets pulled within
one point on eight occasions in the
last period. but couldn't seem to get
the bigrebound whenthey needed It.

Erving, sensing that Denver was
about to explode with one of its

typical second-halfcomebacks, took .’

total command of the Nets' offense.
In the final 7:43, he scored I8 of New
York‘s 24 points.

. WASHINGTON (AP) Players- of _

the National Football League began
receiving Monday a sugpsted model
contract, prepared by their union, to
be used as, a guide in their
negotiations with the NFL's 28
clubs. r _

The NFL Players Association in-

dividual contract 'form would

replace theNFL's Standard Player
Contract which must now be signed
by all players and which the union
claims favors the owners.-

The’ model. unlikely to be
accepted by management, would re-
quire the owners to spell out the
compensation, especially in multi-
year contracts, which a player would
receive if he is injured or otherwise
dropped from the team. Under the
present standard contract, a player
does no necessarily haveto he paid in
the second, third. or future year of a
contract if he is injured during the
first year and unable to perform
again. He must be paid for the year
in which he is injured.
