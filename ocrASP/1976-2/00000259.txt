cing‘b'aclt to win the second. 5-4 in
six innings.

Overall. the team record now
stands at [0-16-1 for the fall-spring
seasons. (The tie came at Siena in a
disputed darkness-shortened game.)

John Dollard started for the
Danes in Saturday's opener and was
victimized by the long ball. The Red
Raider‘s Zack Passaretti homered in
the second inningto give the hosts an
early l-01ead and. for Doilard. it was
downhill all the way.

When Passaretti came up again in
the fourth. there were two Raiders
on. and again he came through; this
time with a two-run double. Ken
Murphy‘s three-run blast in the next
frame gave Colgate a quick 6-0 lead
and put the game out of Albany‘s
reach.

With Jim Case on the mound. the

Danes were stymied. “We couldn‘t
really initiate much of a threat.“ ex-
plained Albany coach Bob
Burlingame. Case had the game well
in hand—and the Danes shut out—
until the last inning. When they
ﬁnally did get on the scoreboard in
the seventh. the visitors found
themselves trailing by ten-thanks
to a four-run Colgate outburst in the
sixth.

j Mike Carnage led off the Albany
seventh with a base hit. his second of
the game. One out later. John
Zaneila singled and Mike Mirabella
walked to load the bags. A
succeeding force out scored Gamage
with the ﬁrst run and a ground ball
error by the ﬁrst baseman plated
Zanella with the ﬁnal tally.

Case allowed the Danes only ﬁve
hits with Gamage picking up two of
them. But the second game was a
different matter.

With the rains coming down.
Albany struck first as Jim
Willoughby crashed an rbi double in
the ﬁrst inning. But Colgate bounced
right back in their half. scoring two
runs on only one hit to grab a 2-1
lead.

In the fourth. Colgate scored
without beneﬁt of a hit. A strikeout
and a wild pitch allowed a Raider to
reach first. Dilello's balk moved him
to second. a stolen base sent him to
third. and an inﬁeld error scored
him.

Trailing 3-1 now.the Danes began
to ﬁght back. In the visiting ﬁfth.
Scott Demner led off with aninﬁeld
single. John Craig singled. and when
Jeff Breglio bunted. all bands were
safe when pitcher McNaliy booted
the ball.

When Willoughby followed with a
screaming drive into rightcenter. it
looked like the Danes might takethe
lead. But a line running catch by

“I said in the beginning of the

“The defense was too concerned
with their all-American attackman

the defense.“ said Fowler. “But once
we settled down we shut them down
the whole second period and most of
the third."

Gary Miller was just tremendous
in goal and Fowler credited him with
keeping the Danes in the game the
whole ﬁrst half.

Terry Brady got the offense rolling
in the second half as he put aten foot

Mohawk Mar/Be Convert

by Spence Ragdo

Mohawk Tower may be returned
to the students.

In a statement released yesterday.

minimum level by August 1977.“ llc

I‘iclds did not specify exactly
where these 200 spttccs would be

possibility.

The statement came as u result of
negotiations with SA President
Andy llnuntnn. who has been work-
ing on tltc conversion of Mohawk
lower since October. .“lt‘s a year

ntcr llllll hall the number I was
shootingfor. so I consider it a loss."
said linumnn. “Ilut I‘m just happy
that he finally did something.“

One of the major considerations in
the cotncrsion of Mohawk 'l owcr is
finding space for tire l‘uctrlty already
located inthe lower. I'hcdowntoun
campus is one viable solution. in
light of the space soon to be vacated
by the Allen Center and the Mllllt.‘
School. llut the uncertain future of
the space inthe Draper complex has.
according to Fields. prevented the
commitment of “additional uptown

space for student residence this fall.”

Dean of Student Affairs Neil
Brown emphasizes that Fields has
made no commitment on a speciﬁc
space. but said that any available
space will come as the resttlt of
“space trade-offs.“

Brown sees Mohawk Tower as a
desirable residence area but also said
that “faculty availability must be
given prime consideration."

The Space UtiIi/rttion Committee
appointed by Fields will look into
several proposals over tltc next few
months. Fields said. “I not confident

Student Survival KitFraud
Now Under Investigation

by Mark Frey

A committee has been formed to
investigate complaints stemming
from the distribution of finals week
survival kits to SUNYA students.

Lust semester an organization
calling itself the Student Rescue
Committee sent advertisements to
parents of SUNYA students. The
ads contained order forms for a sur—
vivnl kit which was reported to con-
tain humorous messages and high
energy snack foods that would help
students survive the crisis of finals
week.

In conjunction with these survival
kits the university committee will in-
vestigate complaints of misleading
advertising. frrtue. and failure to
comply with university solicitation
policy.

Committee member and Director
of Student Activities Put Buchalter
voiced the charge of misleading
advertising: “Many parents in-

tcrperted it [The Student Rescue
Cornmittcc| as being university sanc-
tioned“.

The opening sentence of the
advertisement reads: "On December
15 your SUNY at Albany Student
enters the most crucial. nerve ruck-
ing period of the entire academic
your Final lixnms‘." Apparently
the use of the phrase SUNY at
Albany led many parents to believe
that the whole project was coor-
dinuted th.ough thr university. The
Student Rescue Committee has air
solutly no ties whatsoever with
SUNYA.

The survival kit was priced at
$6.95 and many students felt the kit
was worth well below that figure.

The contents of the kit consisted
of bubble gum‘. beefjerkys. crackers.
sunflower seeds. cheese snacks and
chinese forttrne cookies. As adver-
