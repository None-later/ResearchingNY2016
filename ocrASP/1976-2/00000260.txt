Von Hippel's comments came
during the first day of a two—day
legislative conference on the energy
crisis. Numerous government and

r industry representatives and energy

experts discussed energy issues and

. problems.

The Princeton University
professor said he supports the
development of nuclear power but
he believes that some government
reports, particularly the so-called
Rasmussen-Report. have minimized
the dangers from nuclear reactors.

The Rasmussen Report, named
for the director of the 1974 study,
Dr. Norman C. Rasmussen, es-
timated that a reactor accident had a
one-in-a-million chance per year per
reactor of taking place. It concluded
that such an accident would be likely
to cause 70 deaths.

“A reactor accident could be very
serious. The unfortunate impact of
the Rasmussen Report has been to
give the nuclear industry a
rationalization for its refusals to
make safety-related improvements
called for by technical review
groups." said Von Hippel.

Dr. Rasmussen followed Von

in'the long run. “coal is l0 to loo

. health than nuclear power.” he said.
“Nuclear energy should be a com-

ponent of electrical energy supply at

least until the turn of the century

when new sources can be

developed."
I At an earlier session Wednesday,
the former head of the Federal
Energy Administration said New
,York State should support the
,development of the Atlantic outer
’continental shelf. enact strong
energy conservation measures and
develop its own resources to help
solve its energy problems.

Dr. John C. Sawhill. now the
president of New York University,
said the national energy situation
has an especially serious impact on
the state since New York is only l0
per cent self-sufficient in meeting its
energy needs.

The magnitude of the energy
problem—mainly rising oil prices
and diminishing oil supplies—is
beyond the scope of the state
legislature. he said. But Sawhill
proposed several steps the state
could take to improvethe situation.

Perhaps it was because offhis ex-

education. in any case. Ramsey
Clark voiced strong
support for higher
education, including
the possibility of free
tuition. at acampaign
appearance at SUNYA Wednesday.

Clark wants to be the Democratic
challenger to Republican-
Conservative Senator James

George Washington. according to
Clark, decided “the most important
thing...was a national university."
Clark wonders why the only federal
institutions of higher learning are
military schools. He said even
Washington knew the dangers of an
overly powerful military.

Sixties Style?

more appropriate to the late sixties.

Clark turned to a topic familiar to

nothing wrong with tuition—free in-

Kevin Kellogg asked Clark'about
domestic intelligence operations of
the FBI. The former US Attorney
General replied. “The FBI was run-
ning about 700,000 investigations a
year [during his term in office]." He
said it would be foolish to think an
Attorney General would be made
aware of most covert operations.

Clark's campaign is. without
doubt. grass-roots. Each appearance

they are for money. Contributions
