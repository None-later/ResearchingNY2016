enthusiastic about the internships.

Urique Program

“Our program is really unique.“
she explained, “it originated so
students would be ableto participate
actively in creating changes; to learn
while doing rather than just writing
papers for a professor that never go
anywhere."

There are several internships to
chose from. depending on an in-
dividual's interest.

“Right now we have about four«
teen interns—eight lobbyists. work-
ing with state legislators to pass bills
in various areas. two commissionin-
vestigators who are presently study-
ing the Department of Environmen-
tal Conservation to ascertain its
effectiveness. and four investigative
reporters who follow~up on tips to
investigate various areas of citizen
interest." Slaight explained.

Questions still remain as to'the
construction site. it nance, and legal
aspects. A number of fieldhouse sites
have been considered with interest
centered upon an area east of lndian
Quad and near the Colonial Quad
parking lot. according to another
committee member. Utilities, access.
room for expansion. and the screen-
ing ofthe facility from the rest ofthe
campus have been central discussion
points according to that member.

Financially, Mccklcr said it had
been hoped that $500,000 of the es-
timatcdtwo million dollarcost ofthe
project could be generated on cam-
pus including an estimated $25 per
year voluntary fee for users of the
facility “Likc joining a health club
for students. faculty. staff." said

Mccklcr.

Selling the FSA controlled
Mobnwk Cnntpus or pnrccling out
the facility. kccping thc waterfront
arcu FSA controlled were other op-
tions for raising campus funds. fic-
cording to Mccklcr.

’l‘hc licldhousc as proposed,
modeled after a Boston College
l'ncility whichincludcs saunas. multi-
purpose courts.andatrack. would
place its emphasis totally on student
priority according to committee
members.

Yet it would remain an “FSA pro-
jcct nsit's on state opcrntcd proper-
ly.“ stti’ndcklcr. l-‘SA profits from
this year would provide additional
funds for the ﬁcldhousc.

livcnutunlly cithcr a detailed sur-
vcy or n studuttl rcfcrcndum would
have to he hcld before thc licldhousc
could proceed to construction. said
commilicr' members.
