GUILTY DRINK

A Scottish researcher reports that
it's not how much you drink but
whether you feel guilty about dow-
ning those cocktails that gives you
that splitting headache the next mor-

l)octor Ron MeKechnic. a Scot-
tish psychologist. has told a sym-
posium in Liverpool that people who
feel ill-ai-case about drinkingarc the
ones who suffer the worst hangovers.

JUNKING JUNK

West Virginia has started a major
crackdown to prevent the increase of
school-aged ‘ unk l‘ood Junk

In an unprecedented move. the
West Virginia State Board of Educa-
tion voted to ban the sale of all can-
dy. chewing gum. soft drinks and
ﬂavored ice bars in its public schools
beginning this fall.

The nine-member board. which
includes a doctor and a dentist. said
it issued the decision against so-
called “Junk Food“ in schools
because "On One Hand, we were try-
ing to teach students the value of
good nutrition, while on the other
hand. we were selling food that was
bad for them."

The board said a September-I975
survey of the eating habits of West
Virginia school children indicated
that more than a quarter of the
students were buying nutritionally
deficient food from vending
machines on a regular basis.

The Board has recommended that
vending machine operators replace
the sweet treats with such things as
fruit juices. fresh fruits. peanuts.
yogurt and canned soups.

Associates——the administration-
backed consortium seeking to build
the first private enrichment
facility»~has told the joint com-
mittee on atomic energy that passage
of the initiative would be a national
"catastrophe." Komes suggests the
government should take “Arbitrary

action", if the measure is passed;
In the meantime, Washington
Democratic Congressman Mick Mc-
Cormick, a member of the joint
committee. told a recent energy con-

ference he would “Be very surprised '

if the Federal Government did not
intervene to test the legality" of the
anti-nuclear law.

MOTHER LIBERTY

A New York conceptual artist is

America's 200th birthday.

Michael Langenstcin has in-
formed public officials lie has work-
ed out a plan to completely clothe
the Statue of Liberty on July 4th.

Lttngenstcin plans to wrap the
statue in a gigantic sash. He says he
has contracted with dupont for hun-
dreds of yards of nylon cloth; that a
sailmaker has agreed to put the
drape together: and that a helicopter
ﬁrm is prepared to twirl the drape
around the famous statue.

Says Langcnstein: “France and
the sculptor Bartholdi gave it to usas
a gift. And I want to wrap it to boost
America‘s spirit.“
