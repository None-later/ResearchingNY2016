describing parachute anatomy in a
matter of fact voice and I tried 10
force my attention on the fuzzy
diagrams projected uponlhc screen.
But the ncrvousjarring unsettled my
stomach and punctured my concen-
tration. I looked at the eight other
students crammed tight upon the
sofas on either side of thc oblong
room. They looked intently m the in-
slruclor. The early noon sun had
sifted through the cardboard placed
over the window glass to dllrkcnthe
trailer lsnd cigarette smoke lloatcd
through lhc rlly aflighl from the pro-
jector. Outside I could hear an air-
plunc cnginc revving.

"There are scvcrlll types of
pill‘ilchulc malfunctions." the in-
slruclor was saying. “but they all fllll

cond. That means you've got about
six seconds to gel the emergency
chute out if its going to do you any
good."

During the two hours of
classroom theory my thoughts fluc-
tuated hclwccn vague nervousness
and Harlan! fear. I bravely controlled
my imagination through the lessons
on slccring and landing but my
courage dwindled before the unseen
lhrculs lurking in powerllnes, trees
and water.

I reassured myself that the acci-
dent rule in this sport is very low. At
ll lecture on parachuting I had
lltlcndcd ll couple of months before
they had said only ll people had
been killed in the entire country in
I974. Ironically, the better you gotta!
it the more liker you‘ll die, partly
because more experienced jumpers
lend to go in for air acrobatics and
experiments with stunt parachutes.
The novi cc is relatively safe. they had
said. Chances were good that I
would not wind up at the end ofthc
day looking like is pizza somebody
had carelessly spilled onthl: ground.

So it probably wasn‘t the fellr of
dying; but the reasons for paying
money to go through all this are
decidedly obscure. Possibly it‘s a
desire to challenge some vague Freu-
dian death-wish buried deep within
the subconscious. Perhaps the ﬁrst-
jump nervousness grow out ofthc
instinctual four of falling, or maybe

into instability. The earth seemed to
hang absurdly above me, as if I was

falling away from it.
