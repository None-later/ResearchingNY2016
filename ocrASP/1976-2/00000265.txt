Street-side Acts

by Scott Thomas

thn I arrived at the garden
behind the PAC to see Wednesday
afternoon‘s performance of Black
Elk's Dream by the newly formed
street theater troupe. thc Sintc
Glcska Ensemble. none of its
members were in sight. As I
wandered toward the center of the
podium. I noticed strange. distant
music and eventually caught sight of
a motley group scampcring my way.
singing. mttking loud bizarre noises.
and beckoning curious ttnd startled
onlookers lol'ollowthcm. Yes. it wus
Sintc Glcsku, and when we reached
the garden. the rest of the show was
under way.

The work is buscd on John
Niehurdt‘s book.B/at'k Elk Spcakr.
the life story of u holy mm of thc
Oglalu Sioux Indians. It is it
dramatization of a dream Black Elk
has during un uncxpluinuhlc
childhood illness. As Elk. the man.
nurrulcs. we see him as a child
journeying through the Sioux spirit
world encountering its dictics who

guide him on an arduous voyuge to
the East. the land of perpetual sun.
En route. Elk meets a group of dis-
eased villagers who he heals and
invites to come with him as his nu-
tion. Shicldcd by a protective tree. a
symbol of life. they arrive safely at
their destination and their lcttder
proclaims the peaceful communion
of all creature.

The Sintc Glcska Ensemble is not
ll conventional contpttny Ilnd in
ordcr to fully appreciate the inten-
tions behind their work. one must
hold a few preconceptions about
theater in uhcyuncc. The group in-
vitcd thc uudicnccto sit around them

with great cffcrvcsccncc.

Much of the notion consislcd of
improviscd dancing. singing. and

music of a drum and a crude wind in-
