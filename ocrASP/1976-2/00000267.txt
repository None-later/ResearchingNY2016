her job to see that adequate and
healthy'foods are served in the quad
cafeterias.

‘ . “Most students consumetwice the

amount of protein that they need.”
says Barbara. “The quad chefs com-
plain that the ﬁrst thing they always
run out of are the meat items.
Americans have been brought up

thinking that the more protein in

their diet. the healthierthey‘ll be. but
this isn't necessarily true."

. The body uses protein as a source
of energy. and for synthesis and
repair. Once the body‘s energy re-
quirements are met. any excess pro-
tein remaining after synthesis and
repair is converted into fat.

A person on a high protein. low
carbohydrate diet will use almost all
of the protein for energy and syn-
thesis. However. when car-
bohydrates and proteins are both
consumed excessively. car-
bohydrates will be used for energy
ﬁrst. The result is excess protein.
maybe excess carbohydrate. and in
the long run. excess body fat.
“Because seconds can be taken.
there is always the temptation to

v return for more food." says Taylor.

explaining that Food Service policy
is to offer all of the basics: meat.
starches. grains. fruits and
vegetables. and allow the student to
decide how much and what they
want to eat.

“Each person is different." stresses
Barbara. “proper caloric intake
differs from person to person.
depending on their sex. weight.

differing metabolisms.”

Barbara Taylor is familiar with
campus meal plans. having been on
one at the University of Delaware.
where she received a 3.8. in Nutri-
tion. Each weekday, she cats at least
one meal on one of the quads. she
feels the quads offer healthy diets.
but urges any student. on-campus or
off. who has any nutritional ques-
tion. problems. or complaints, to call
her at 457-5950. She is also offering a
class. “Nutrition and Weight con-
trol." to be held next semester.

Ms. Taylor doesn‘t feel that the
American diet has changed too
much over the last ten years;
however. she remarked that meat
consumption has risen. and
Americans are more educated about
what constitutes a good diet.

Head Nurse. Leone Siple. of the
Student Health Service hasn‘t
noticed much of achangeinstudents‘
diets from 10 years ago. but noticed
that “more people are concerned
with eating organic food. and more
people are becoming vegetarians."

Dr. Ethel Cermak. of the Student
Health Service. declined to offer
herself as an authority on nutrition

 

    

but has noticed that fewer students
are coming to her with obesity
problems. and fewer students are'
overweight. There was a'n
overweight clinic at the Student
Health Center. but this has been dis-
continued. says Dr. Cermak. as
fewer students seem to need it.

Perhaps the reason fewer cor-
pulent students trod the campus'
nowadays. has to do with a fattening
accessibility of nutritional informa-
tion. Most students now knowthat a
healthy diet consists of grain
products. cereals. fruits and
vegetables. and meat.

Meat is included because it is a
rich protein source. but if proteins
can be obtained by other means.
then meat intake can be greatly cur-
tailed. grains contain carbohydrates.
proteins. and minerals. Fruits and
vegetables provide vitamins.
minerals. carbohydrates. water. and
protein.

“The diet needs of people remain
constant.“ says Barbara Taylor.
“But the world population and
economic factors inﬂuence how our
nutritional needs are met.“

The United States is the most

powerful agricultural nation In the
world. and has , been. producing
enough food to theoreticallyf , I
of its inhabitants. This agrictdtur'al
strcnﬂh derives from the enormous
grain yields the . U.S. has been
prospering from for the past 20
years. One of the major reasons for
these enormous yields has been the
widespread use of modern fertiliser.

Food is to the U.S. what oil is to

 

  
   
   
  

'the Middle'East. and although the

only time we associate the two‘ia
when we make salad. the two are
closely related. Fuel. mostly in the
form of natural gas. is essentialinthe
manufacture of modern fertiliser. As
the price of fuel goes up. the price of
fertilizer rises. This means it not only
costs more to feed an automobile.
but that it also costs more to feed
human beings.

Plants can only use about 15% of
the solar energy they receive.
animals can only convert 10% of the
plant energy they consume. and
humans convert l0% of the animal
food they consume for energy. In
each step along the food chain. rou-
ghly 90% of potential food energy is
lost.
