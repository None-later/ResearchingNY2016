of thes “failures.” if such they are.
natural feelings of sympathy for the

likely we identify with them readily
becauane realize that. no matter
how big our ambitions and ideals.
most of us are not of the stuff of
which heroes are made.

But there is something beyond
this. What about those who do not
so much fail to develop their full
potential as seem at some point.
often in mid-career. to shift direction
and achieve a great. but negative dis-
tinction“! These are the anti-heroes.
They had a fascination for Greeks
and Romans. as well as for present-
day Americans. Both failure and the
diabolic exert a strong attraction. In
Milton‘s Farm/rive Lost. it is Satan
who is the center of attention.
Remember a tag line in a popular
television program. a line which
never seems to lose its piquancy,
“The devil made me do it.’".'

An example of this phenomenon
may be found in the American
Revolution. Few heroes of that
period have aroused as much interest

much wnttc

cm. the tra or. Benedict,

    
   
 

unsuccessful attack on Quebec. Ar-

 

Sarato'ga. (In the engagements at
both Quebec and Saratoga he was

wounded in the same leg.) At this,

point Arnold was a major hero.
Thereafter the defects in his
character began to gain the ascen-
dancy. He was brilliant and
courageous. but also vain. im-
pulsive. and addicted to luxurious
living.

At Valley Forge. Arnold. was
reproved by Washington for using
scarce army supplies for a private
dinner party. While stationed in
Philadelphia. he married Peggy
Shippen. a Tory beauty. and enjoyed
an elegant style of living and enter-
taining obviously beyond his means.
Congressional investigations ensued
and uncomplimentary rumors cir-
culated. Probably for ﬁnancial
reasons. as well as because of out-
rage at not having received the
recognition he believed he deserved.
Arnold entered into negotiations to
which had recently made him com-
mander. had recently been made
commanc Following the dis-
covery of the p'ot. Arnold escaped
and joined the British. Though he
became a .British officer and fought
against the Am :rican colonists. he
had lost forever his opportunity of
becoming a hero.

If the Americans have Benedict
Arnold. the Athenians had
Alcibiades. A relative of Pericles. a

hold Won his greatest victory at.

'member'of ‘the highest circles of
' Athenian aristocracy. rich and hand-
some. Alcibiades was a leader of the
jeunesse darce. He was brilliant.
capable. but at the same time an-
stable. and fond of luxurious thing.
He was one of the followers of
Socrates. which may strike you as
rather strange. But how could such a
young man as Alcibiades remain
aloof fromthe most excitingintcllec-
tual movement of his age? Surely the
presence of an Alcibiades among his
followers lent added weight to the

. charge that Socrates was a corrupter

of youth.

It was Alcibiades who. during the
Peloponnesian War. proposed and
organized the expedition against
Sicily. As leader of that expedition.
he had already reached the island
when he was recalled to Athens to
answer charges of havingcommitted
a serious act of impiety on the eve of
his depart urc.

We shall never know if Alcibiades
was guilty of the charge or if he had
been maliciously accused by his
enemies. In any case. instead of
rcturningto Athens to stand trial. he
defected to Sparta. Though he
claimed that his intention was not to
light against his native city. but only

against his enemies within that city.
who were also the enemies of the
state. he proved to be of great
assistance to the Spartans in their
struggle against Athens. Of course
without his leadership. the Sicilian
expedition was a disastrous failure.

Alcibiades was. however. not able
to keep the confidence of the Spar-
tans. The British had never com-

ALA. A

to h But when the results were not
as'good as had been expected. the
Athenians. as ﬁckle as Alcibiades
himself. turned against him. For a
second time Alcibiades found it ex-
pedient to remain at a distance from
Athens.

In spite of this decision.just before
the Athenian defeat-at Aegospotami.
Alcibiades offered his countrymen
his assistance and some good advice;

.‘ret‘ wit

 

ancient enemy; hi all the- Greeks.
Finclly. through the machinations of
the Athenians and Spartans com-
bined. Alcibiades was slain. About
Alcibiades. our information is less
certain than about Benedict Arnold.
Perhaps he was not an anti-hero
after all. ‘

At Saratoga there is a famous
statue of Benedict Arnold‘s wound-
ed leg. Does anyone know of a statue
of Alcibiades?

Fear .of "Falling

r'mrlilrm'rlll'rwn page I .4 ~

an open canopy at 2.500 feet descent
would take about two and a half
minutes. not enough timerto master
the complexities of wind and
parachute speed. The hell with it. I
began a shaky rendition of“Singing
In the Rain.“

Things gradually fell into place;
landmarks became recognizable.
houses got bigger. Then I saw the
tires. arranged like a ring of tiny
white life savers a few hundred yards
ahead. A parchutist travels at 7
MPH facing forward but he's got to
adjust to wind speed and direction.
The wind was behind my right
shoulder.

“PULL YOUR RIGHT
TOGGLE." It was a short sudden
burst from a megaphone. lstopped
singing and pulled hard on the cord
that controls steering. spinning to
the right. away from the drop zone.

“LEFT TOGGLE. LEFT
TOGGLE." I grabbed too hard on
the left cord. going almost complete-
Iy around. I could make out the
orange megaphonein the hand of the
man leaning against the hood of a

truck. I was too low and knew I
wouldn't make the drop zone.

“PICK A FIELD.” I was coming
down in the back yard of a farm
house. across the road from the
white tires. A wicked looking fence
cut the ﬁeld in two. On one side a
herd of goals was grouped together
indifl‘crently in the corner. on the
other a dog barked loudly. running
in wild circles as the ground rushed
up at me.

“DON‘T LOOK DOWN!“ I look—
cd straight ahead at the tree tops
suddenly at eye level. My feet hitjust
at the base ol' the fence and I rolled
back into the dog half of the field.
Ground contact was surprisingly
gentle -—likejumping off a l‘ourfoot
platform. I pressed the quick release
button and my harness fell away.
spillingthe air out ofthc chutelying
half collapsed on the other side ofthc
fence. Standing up. I realized I was
okay. The world had taken on a new
light. peaceful and serene. beautiful
and happy. I smiled down at the dog
glaring up at me and panting hard.

“Hi dog.“ I said.

It snapped at my ass.
