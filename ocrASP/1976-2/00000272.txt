Burlingarne, coach of the batsmen. Where have you gone Jack Leahy? Terry

When the snows closed the ﬁelds. the Great Danes took the court, as did
the Bob Lewis-coached Pups. Where have you gone Jothuattrocchi? Dave

Then there was that September afternoon when this youth climbed the
Campus Center stairs to CC356, home of “Big” Denny Elkinand AMIA. The
rest of this part of the story is history. ‘

Speaking of history. here they are. the Ten Most Memorable Events in
Four Years at Albany State:

1) February 21, 1976: WSUAjains the NY Islanders broadcasting crew.
Nothing went right: technical difﬁculties prevented the airing of all but three
minutes and the Islanders last to Boston. 2-l. Fortunately,two of the all-time
greats were there, Doug Lewanda and Michael Curwin.

2) February 7. 1974: Byron Miller's jumper beats Siena, as the Danes fans
“Check that score." It was the only victory over Siena in four years.

3) November I, 1973: The Boaters kick Binghamton, 2-1, to win the
University Center Tournament at Binghamton in an overtime marathon
played with the thermometer reading 26 degrees. Chepe Ruano was the hero
on offense. Steve Carlsen. the backup goalie starred in the net after Henry
Obwald was injured.

4) Whalers 4, Nanooks 3: Sorry if I get personal here, but that was-the
greatest floor hockey game in history, going 38:55 into overtime before the
best player in the league. Bill Jonat. scored the gamewinner. to give the

Whalers the Cup.
5) The Battle of Brockport: And they call soccer is game. Well. this was

war. Albany State versus 2,000screaming Brockport rcoters. Watching Stu

' Shalat knocked unconscious, the melee that ensued. . .unmatched in four

years of sports experience. - _

6) Tom DeBlois, 1,006 yards, and a 9-0 football season.

7) Albany 55, Oneonta 53: With Doc Sauers yelling “Move” the Danes
came from behind to win in overtime as Vic Cesare hit a dramatic shot at the
buzzer to win it. Some great thing areinstorc for Danes fans inthe next few

years.

8) The Battle of the Budget 1: Three years ago, Central Council, in its
“infinite wisdom“, voted to cut AMIA‘s budget by 33 percent. That April
night, at 6 AM, the AMIA Council voted unanimously to fold AMIA.
Threats may not be the best procedure when you are seeking funding. but
that time it worked. Today, AMIA is one of the most respected
organizations, a real tribute to the‘hard-working AMIA Council-members
and Student Assistants.

9) The Battle of the Budget 11: Just three weeks ago. the intercollegiate
program faced a 20 percent cut in funds, but after a long, bitter session, the
cuts were virtually restored. Who will light for AAB next year...please come
forward.

IO) AMIA—The Whole Experience: It is no secret that the author of the
Slants has a special place in his heart for that organization. Throughthe four
years, new sports like ﬂoor hockey, volleyball, and a superstars tournament
have risen. The many people who have come and gone, and those who
remain, have time and again proven their interest in the students and their
university.

Finally. there are hundreds of people who should be mentioned inthe final
Slant, but a handful who must be mentioned: Doug lewanda (Sports
Director, WSU A); Michael Curwin (Islanders broadcasting partner); Bill
Schieffelin (the finest gentleman soccer coach in the State); Dave Cohn
(former AMIA president): Doc Sauers. Bob Ford and Joe Garcia; and most
of all, the one and only Dennis Elkin and the members of the AMIA
Councils.

Where have all those others gone? I don‘t know. but I'll soon be ﬁnding
out.

But what does this all mean?

This is the Final Slant. and only those who really know him can feel the
author's emotions as these ﬁnal tops of the typewriter‘s keys close out the best
four years in a man's life.

7 Golfers Seventh

'in'ltt‘vitational

~ syltstso nosan .

The Siena Indians, with a score of
317, captured the 12th Annual
SUNY Albany Invitational Golf
Tournament, Monday. on the
Danes' home course.

Siena's four-man total was one
stroke better than Buffalo’s who
ﬁnished at 318 as Mike Hirsch four-
putted the eighteenth. Albany came
in seventh with a 338 scare.

For the Danes, Mike Dulin and
John Ammerman recorded 84's
while Jae McCoy and Frank Sce
collected 85's. But the highlight of
the match was a hale-in—one record-
ed by See on the 140 yard ninth hole.
Using an eight-iron, the freshman
from Yorktown Heights sunk his tee
shot and thus had the honor of recor-
dingthe ﬁrst ace in the history ofthc
tournament.

To this point. the Albany golfers
are sporting a 4-2 dual-meet record.
With victories over Middlebury.
R. P.l., Union. and an upset win over
Plattsburgh, Coach Dick Sauers has
everything to be happy about.

“I‘m very pleased with our dual-
meet record so far. We have a young
team; very inexperienced. McCoy is
the only returning letterman.“

Ammerman leads the team with
an 81 stroke average whilethe others
are not far behind. Tomorrow, the
Danes traVcl to Hamilton to faccthc
Tigers beginning at 1 PM. The ﬁnal
match of the season is Friday. May
14, when the Danes meet Union for
the second time.

‘ by Mike Plskallhl

If you think the varsity tennis
team is doing okay, takealook at the
junior varsity nettersl This past
Wednesday they knocked off
Cobleskill by a 7-2 score to notch
their sixth spring victory without a
defeat.

Albany did it by capturing ﬁve of
the six singles matches and two of
the three doubles tilts. The Pups who
did the growling— and the
winning—were Mike Fertig. Alan
Berger, Brian Smith, Andy An-
toszyk. and Dave Daroski. And in
doubles, the teams of Fertig-Berger
and [Steve] Sapinski-Doroski
emerged victorious.

But winning is nothing new for
this year‘s squad. lnfact, they played
against—and beat—Siena‘s varsity
squadjust this past week. "That was
a big boost for us,” admits Coach
Michael Garcia.

"We've had outstanding perfor-

IJﬁvivNetters Still Unbeaten

mances this year Irom Tom Zimmer-
mann and Andy Antoszyk,” he can-
tinues. Zimmermann is 5-0 in singles
competition and 4-1 in doubles so far
this year. “He‘s the most consistent
player." And he and Antoszyk are
what Garcia terms “the backbone of
the team."

“Number one is Mike Fertig,” he
adds. “He's the best all-around
player and although he's lost twice.
he's up against the opponents‘ best
players.“ .As I or the rest of the Pups?
“They put out all the time and never
give up. That‘s why we were able to
pull out 5-4 wins against Hudson
Valley and Orange County."

But so far this year. most of the
matches have not been that close. “I
think they deserve some publicity,"
asserts Garcia. And who can argue
with that? Today at 4 PM the Pups
take on Hudson Valley in a home cn—
counter. And if they win again, don‘t
say we didn't warn you!

Al Martin Gets Jet Tryout

by Craig Bell

Albany State placekicker Alan
Martin will be the second Albany
State football player in the Danes‘
history to get a tryout with a pro
team when he walks into the New
York Jets training camp Friday,
May 14.

“I don‘t expect to be kicking for
the Jets next season. but the ex-
posurc and the experience will be an
invaluable asset to me as I try to
catch on with other teams (the
Giants in particular).“

In Martin‘s favoristhe fact that he

connected on 22 of 23 PAT’s and
that most of his kickoffs Were hit well
into the cndzone with a good hang-
ing time.

AI hit on only 4 of 13 field goals
this year but this was due to the fact
that most of his attempts were from
beyond the forty yard Ii no. He has a
lifetime best of forty-ﬁve yard (he
booted that one against Hofstra in
1974.

Al will be trying out at the Jets
training cump at liofstru Long
Island and all of us here at Albany
wish him the best of luck.

sued. Albany fell behind early, trail-
ing 3—1 at the half but then just
turned it around with an eleven goal-
secand half outburst and buried the
Indians 12—6. “The second half was
probably the best lacrosse we played
all year," said Fowler.

The thirteenth ranked CW. Post

after three quarters. Post was hang-
ing on to the slimmest of leads at 6—

"Individually, ‘Tom Graziose,
