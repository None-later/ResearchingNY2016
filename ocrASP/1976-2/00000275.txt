CUNY Students

Finish Term

NEW YORK—Following the un-
precedented two-week shutdown of
theentire New York City University
system, students and teachers went
back to work last month angered
over what many called the abandon-
ment of all concern {or public educa-
tion here.

City Comptroller Harrison
Goldin attacked CUNY President
Robert Kibbec for not spend?
within the means of the systcnt‘~
budget. Goldin has called for
Kibbee's resignation for his refusal
to cut back on CUNY expenditures
in spite of New York‘s continuing
ﬁscal crisis.

Kibbee‘s decision to close the city
universities came after the city could
not meet CUNY‘s June 1 payroll
deadline. and no ﬁnancial assistance
was at hand.

Duringthe CUNY crisis. city and
state ofﬁcials met and decided to
charge tuition to students attending
the once tuition-free university
system. The planned CUNY tuition
will be at a level similar to that oft he
State University system.

The decision to impose tuition was
one of the major factors in the state's
agreement to provide the necessary
funds which enabled the city univer-
sities to reopen.

The end offrce-tuition for CUNY
is now being challenged in the
couns.

SUMMER I976

 

Only 28 years ago.‘New York did
not haye a state university. Today it
has one (of the largest. best
coordinated. and pioneering
networks of public higher education
in the nation. Last year educators
from 25 foreign countries came to
New York to study SUNY‘s
innovative structure and programs.
Nine other states have recently
reorganized their public colleges on
the SUNY model.

What the State University has
done is design a new kind of public
university to meet New York's
emerging educational needs of the
l970's and beyond.

Instead of one or two giant
campuses with immense
enrollments. SUNY established a
network of human-sized colleges
across the state to bring higher
learning to the people rather than the
other way around. This arrangement
brings cultural richness to many
towns and villages ofthe state too.
and helps support family life and
local loyalties. The university has
also had a major economic impact
on some regions. For example.

SUNY is western New York‘s largest
employer. and the College at
I’lattsburgh accounts for one dollar
out of every 13 spent in Clinton
County.

The institutional diversity of the
State University is also uniquc. The
network includes: four major
university centers; 14 arts and
science colleges: six twoyettr
agricultural and technical colleges:
specialized colleges in such ﬁelds as
agriculture and life sciences.

maritime studies. environmental
science and forestry. and industrial
and labor relations; and 30 two-year
community colleges. Nearly one-half
of SUNY‘s 367.000 students are in
two-year colleges.

Students at SUNY train for

produalve work as well asthe liberal
arts. last year. SUNY pic'psi‘ed‘

state. as well as many 'of the

health-science centers train more
doctors and nurses annually than all
but one other public university.
While the typical college student is
l7 to 22 years old. State University
students are of all ages and
backgrounds. SUNY is not just for
recent high school graduates but for
all the people who wish to learn

schoolteachers.

university cln-ses.

Also. the State University serves
many who would not othern‘se be
able to go to college. More than 76
percent of the students from the
four-year institutions have family
incomes of less than $12,000. the
state average. At the community
college the ﬁgure is 82 per cent.

In building a new kind of public
university. SUNY has pioneered in
new ideas of higher education. Its

degree program in America. SUNY

’ was the ﬁrst pubitc university to

review its presidents‘ performances
every five years.

The State university has not only
built innovatively. but with quality.

scholars with enormous power to.
solve all sorts of problems for New
Yorkers. '
Adued Growth 

While it does not stopadjustingto
new conditions and innovating to
provide necessary new services. the
State University has adjusted its
growth rate to reflect changing birth
rates and private college
opportunities in New York. The
percentage of New York State high
school graduates enrollingin SUNY
has remained constant at 27 percent
for the past four years. While state
aid to New York’s private colleges
has doubled in the past ﬁve years.
SUNY‘s share ofthe state budget has
remained almost constant at 7.4
percent—in the same period.

Finally. the State University
operates efﬁciently. A I973 State
Education Department report found
that the annual per-student costs at
S U N Y‘s four-year colleges—
SZ.400—is below that of most of
New York‘s leading private colleges.
which range from 52.394 to $3.663.

ball is caught. the player hurls the
pelota back at the wall. and hopes his
opponent can‘t catch it.

Helmets are worn to avoid injury.
as a rock-hard ball. hurled at one‘s
head may result in a fractured skull.
Contrary to what some say. a player
does not score points by maiming

another player but by hurling an un-
returnable volley. that his opponent.
instead of catching, dives to avoid.

The novelty ofthis sport is not

only in the strange mechanics ofthe
grime. but in the fact that spectators
are allowed to gamble on the players.
Betting options include a daily dou-
ble and a superfccta.

Americans always claim that bet-
ting ruins a sport. American sports
followers love the unexpected. and
they don‘t believe in huvinga “fixed”
winner. 'I‘hut's why so many
Americans appreciate professional
wrestling. _

Back to the bettors. Jai-alai has
attracted a wide range of followers
from compulsive gamblers to
housewives. Odds are given on the
matches, and obviously. as in horse
racing. some competitors are much
bcttcr than others. Thus people
usually bet the favorite to win.

At the track, a tip from the horse's
mouth usually comes in a winner.
With no precedent for jui-alai tips.
the absurd creeps into the betting.
Recently. a woman bettor received a
tip that since a player's name was un-
pronouncable. he would win. On
this basis she bet on him and sure
enough. he won.

In addition to the regular even-
ing matches. jai-alai offers the com-
pulsive bettor andjai-alai fanaticthe
novelty of matinee performances.

Surprisingly enough. jai-alai is
catching-on due to a number of fac-
tors. but probably most of all
because to northeasterners it is a new
and unusual spon.
