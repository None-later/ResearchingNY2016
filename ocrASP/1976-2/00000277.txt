AMYL HIGH

A California drug-analyzing lab
reports that one of the latest drug
fads making the rounds is the inhala-
tion of “Amyl Nitrite.“

Amyl Nitrite is a drug. available in
most states only by prescription. that
is used to quickly reduce the blood
pressure in persons experiencing
“Angina” heart pains.

However. it turns out that the
drug is readily available over-the-
counter to consumers under a varie-
ty of disguised names.

Users who take one or two whiffs
of the fumes from a small bottle of
Amyl Nitrite report an immediate
feeling of light-headed giddyness
and levity. Several eastern medical
researchers claim the drug may also
be a sexual enhancer that intensiﬁes
the senses during the sex act.

Amyl Nitrite. itself. is reportedly
being marketed to the public in small
bottles of liquid as an “Odor-izer.“
Some of the names it is said to be
sold under include "Aroma of Men";
“Jock-Aroma": “Locker Room
Aroma" and even “Brand X."

Pharm Chem laboratories in
Palo Alto reports that the physical
and mental effects from Amyl Nitrite
last only four or ﬁve minutes at
most. The drug is reportedly not
hazardous to most people. except
those already suffering from
Anemia. from the eye disease
Glaucoma. or from pre—existing low
blood pressure problems.

Rx POT

A 28-year-old Washington. DC.
man has ﬁled a petition with the US
Government. asking that he be per-
mitted to smoke marijuana to lessen
the symptoms of an eye disease he
suffers from.

The petition was ﬁled with the
Drug Enforcement Administration
by Robert Randall. who haslost his
vision in one eye and had the sight in
the other signiﬁcantly impaired from
the disease glaucoma.

A number of medical researchers
have reported recently that put-
smoking apparently relieves eye
pressure. and can be effective in
treating the symptoms of glaucoma.
Randall is the first person. however.
to directly petition for the right to
smoke grass on medical grounds.

Ilis rcquettt includes opinions

signed by doctors claiming that the
treatment will probablybeeffeaive.
Doctor Robert Peterson of the
Government‘s National Institute of
Drug Abuse says Governmern
resellrth shows that marijuana is a
"Promi ing treatment." Harlem.
Petersol adds that one drawback to
the marl] Jﬂnu approach is that “Not
everyone enjoys getting high.”

A Federal Grand Jury has accused

that the birds had been intentionally

HEAD COPS

A sign of the changing times is the
report from Dallas. Texas. that
police departments there are now
permitting admitted pot smokers to

      

' join the local police forces.

A survey of Dallas area law en-
forcement agencies has found that
most of the departments will accept
applicants who have admitted to ex-

‘ perimenting with t

 

because there are fewer and fewer

vqualiﬁed' recruits these days who

have never touched the stuff.

ment estimates that 15 per cent of
those applying for police jobs has
smoked marijuana, and that half of
those hired in the past three years
have smoked pot at least once.

GARGLE POWER

A new survey has found that
Americans use more mouthwash
than the rest of the world combined.

Mouthwash industry ﬁgures in-
dicate that Americans currently gar-
gle 28 million gallons of mouthwash
a year—spending a quarter of a
billion dollars on the liquid breath
freshener.

It's estimated that seven in every
ten Americans use mouthwash.

You've heard of corn-fed or grass
fed beef. but now. how about
chicken-dropping fed beef?

One in every 50 eggs produced in
the United States comes from
Hillsboro County. Florida-and
County Commissioners there have
come up with a unique plan to get rid
of that industry‘s most common by-
product: chicken manure.

Hillsboro Commissioners have
votedto pay the cost of transporting
some 40 tons of chicken droppings
collected from the county’s farms to
a University of South Florida
agricultural experiment station.

There. the manure will be mixed
with corn silage and fed to beef. who
will eventually wind up in super-
marketets and on the dinner table.

FAKE FORGE

Alabama may soon be ﬂooded.
with a wave of Sunday Check
Forgers.

Citing a state law voiding any
check dated on the Sabbath. the
Alabama State Supreme Court has
ruled that a forger can not be sent to
prison for writing a worthless check
dated on any Sunday.

In the Court‘s words. “A void in-
strument cannot be the basis of an
indictment for forgery." The Court
conceded that its decision might'
seem unfair and "RepUgnant to
logic."

SCENTED CENTS

One of the fastest growing
businesses in America these days is
the market for perfume for men.

The fragrance foundation reports

that tile sale of male perfumes has
sky-rocketed to $650 million a year.
where it already rivals the female
perfume market. currently at $950
million annually.
Beauty Fashion, the magazine of the
perfume industry. reports that sales
of men‘s perfumes and colognes is
growing at the rate of 25 percent per
year. The publications says that

PET LENSES

It was bound to happen sooner or
later: veterinarians at the University
of Georgia have perfected contact
lenses . . . for dogs.

Gretchen Schmidt. a veterinary
optllamalogist at the University.
says that dogs and cats with eye
problems are being ﬁtted with “soft
contact lenses" identical to tllsoe
worn by nearsighted humans.

Schmidt adds. however. thtlt the
contacts are not being prescirbcd to
poocllcs because of ncur-sightedness
or other visual problems. Instead.
the doggic contacts are being used as
transparent bandages that can be
ﬁtted over small wounds on the pets‘
eyes.
