Has the Place for YOu!!!

BACKGROUND

lnthe late l960's and prior tothecompletion of construction plans
forthe new campus. our University community learned that our long-
awaited Field House would not be constructed in the immediate
future. The need for such.a facility. which existed than. increased
commensurate with the university's growth through succeeding
years.

The rapid growth of participation in men’s and women's
intramural athletics (62% participation increase over l970-7l) and
the need for increased open or free time recreation have underscored
the desireability of a multi-use facility.

With these factors in mind. a group of students. faculty, and
administrators met to determine possible courses of action which
address these needs. (Membership of the group is listed below).

Early considerations included the possibility of a relatively low
cost “bubble” similar tothat which is in use at the SUNY at Buffalo.
Visits by Committee members to the Buffalo campus, Boston
University. Boston College and M.I.T.,l have ledthe Committee
to certain preliminary conclusions. At this time, the Committee'has
eliminated the “bubble” from further consideration.

Sll trcture of longer life expectancy and service, such as the
facu. 'd: .'eloped at Boston College. is now viewed with enthusiasm
by this group. Using the features of the Boston College facility as a
model. the (‘omittce has now developed a proposal for broader
campus review. The basic elements of the building and general
characteristics are described in these materials.

Presidents of . “o aIclIitectural~engineering-constructural ﬁrms
have visited the campus. upon invitation- of the Committee. Total
cost of a proposal of the nature described onthe next page has been
estimated at somewhat under $2 million. including equipment. (It is
important to note that construction time has been estimated at 9 - l2
months).

Funding of this proposed structure will be dependent upon some.
or all. of the following:

a) the Athletic Advisory Boani Surplus

b) the University Auxilliary Services (FSA)

c) user fees

d) other sources to be determintd

After careful review and consideration, the committee has
determined that a long-term funding arrangement (IO- 20 year) will
be necessary; therefore. it is important that the broad opinion of
our academic community besought'priortothe makingofany ﬁrm
committments.

The Committee believes that this long-term funding arrangement
must primarily be supported by a mandatory user’s fee for all
undergraduates. It is estimated that this fee must be between SIS - 25
per academic year. A referendum in the fall will be taken to see if the
student body is in favor of this concept.

This information is presonted for your review and reaction. Prior
to the fall referendum. slides of the Boston College Student
Recreation Center will be displayed at a table in the Campus Center.
This table will be staffed by Committee members who will be
available to answer questions.
