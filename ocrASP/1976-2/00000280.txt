ALBANY  PRESS

SUMMER lQ-b

 

by Edward Cowley

A couple of years ago I wrote a
piece for the ASPabout military ex-
perience which could have been read
with possible references to the Un-
iversity. In Order to-maintain a
proper and near ofﬁcial sense of
Albany symmetry. these few lines are
about the University and they might.
of course. have military meaning

In some ways this is a lament. It
has to do with a change of spirit that
has occurred since I967. Isomclimcs
think of it as a loss of spirit. The pur-
pose is at least partly to document
the way it has been against the way it
now is. The theme is the dedication
of the art building. A few of us
struggled for a long time to produce
a plan. in anticipation of what the
future might bring. To plan and con-
struct an actual building in conjuc-
tion with the trends and tradition of
the bureaucratic system is
somewhat of a miracle. The com-
bination of State. University. and
Architect is like Hell, ﬁre. and dam-
nation. altough not always syn-
chronized in that order. Substantial
evidence showsthat the building did
get built. and this is to recall a few of
our difficulties in getting fromthcre
to here.

The enemies were different in
those days. Ours seemed to be the
architect‘s office and the Purchasing
Agents of Central Administration.
After many stages of planning. it
became apparent that our art gallery
was dcsigucd to be larger than what
had bccn requested. To our credit.
We actually did know that a gallery
can hardly be too large. but local
spuccjusticc required that it be for-
mally questioned. To our joy the
answer was that Ed Stone wanted
the gallery the size planned and.
therefore. so did lbs Governor. This
pronounccmcnt cumc from the
Governor‘s Office. It was great.

At times it was claimed that we
were building what was destined to
bc somctltinglikclhc l-lurvurd ofthc
Hudson. The rcul problem was try-
ing to kccpuspirmions in proportion
lo possiblc nclticvcmcnl. It was easy
to think too small. illld it was follyto
think too big. Hy conlrusl with to-
tlny. the difficulty was in dealing
with dcgrccs of optimism rut her than
will] waves of dcspuir.

IIy chance. good fort unc. and
sonic third generation Kerry luck.
Don Moclton become the Gallery
Director and Nancy I.iddlc the
Associate. Bulb hclpcd to remake
thc gullcry space so than it would be
useful. Whilc Slonc had provided
splice. he also gave us pluslcr walls
and no entry spucc for large objects.
()ur fucully made the corrcctions so
thnl lhc wnlls hccumc wood and
uscl'ul. and a ten foot wide trap door
appeared in the floorthrough which
lurgc olijcds could enter. Wc cvcn
got ‘lll' conditioning.

One of the slrungcsl demands of
compulsive symmetry cullcd for a

large door at the top of the gallery
stairs. a door which would have gone
directly intol‘ne jewelry studio. After
many letters. conferences. and
phone calls. we succeeded in
eliminating the unneeded door. The
only reason the door is mentioned is
that it was so obviously unnecessary
but so difﬁcult to eliminate that at
times I get the feeling it might not
have really happened. However.
sometimes I suspect that the door
was only a suggestion of what wasto
come. a clue. as it werclo our future.
Actually last year we evenellminated
jewelry.

After all the major battles were
done and we were attempting to
regroup. Richard Slankicwicz
pointed out that we had failed to
produce a sculpture studio. He was
absolutely right. and we now know
that it isn't really possible to have a
sculpture studio in the polished en-
vironment of white rippled ceilings
and shiny waxed floors that mean
Albany. Just recently we ﬁnally
found a good studio in a portion of
the Dudley Observatory. and now all
seems well. Actuallythcse facts and
opinions are all background to what
really happened at the dedication of
the art building.

To have a dedication is something
we wouldn‘t do today. It is com-
plicated and somewhul expensive.
and if is entirely positive. As a matter
of fact. by employing the evaluation
systems we now use on everything
from the outside and inside. as well
as the up and down. we would
probably conclude that no one on
our present faculty is qualified to
hundlc such a responsibility. But
then in I967. we didn't know that
povcrl y was pressing. and we might
even have believed that better days
wcrc nltcad. Incidentally. it‘s hard to
know when you are having your bcsl
days. especially when the dedication
day itself became so difficult.

There were about 200 people in-
vitcd to dinner at the I’utroon
Room. Thc guests were artists from
around the State with at Icnst one
representative from each of the four
year campuses. 'l‘hc Palroon Room
was rcudy to serve wine for the first
time. and even before the wine. a bur
was to bc nvuilublc in thc l’utroon
Loungc. ’I'Iic (lullcry wosto feature a
sclcclion of work from lhc
Rockcl'cllcr Collection. a plan which
'I'hom O'Connor had helped start
nearly two years hcforc. 'I‘hc cnlirc
on building was to be open for inr
spcction which meant the ncwcqulp-
mcnl had to be in pluccund the new
studios nccdcd to at least look like
lhcy could he used.

Finally the day arrived. I bud
bought at new dark blue suit for the
occasion. I went to school very early
in thc tnorning and carried the suit
on ll Itnngcr. The day was spent
arranging equipment and checking
on everything from dinncr plans to
hotel llccommodnllons for illl lhc

guests. with some foresight. I had
reserved a room In one of the new
dorms. a room where I could shower
and change before the evening
began.“ It was a long day‘s work. but
after five enough was done so I could
meet my wife. Mrs. Liddle was about
to have a baby (named Sarah) and
we hoped she would wait until after
the dedication. She joined us in the
dorm room along with Doris
Klnsclla from Connecticut.

The ladies were already dressed so
it was my turn. It was disappointing
to discover that the showers didn‘t
work at all. Reduced to washing in
the sink. I found out that while the
sink worked. unfortunately the hot
water did not. This was not an im-
pressive beginning for an architec-
tural celebration. It occurred to me
that anything might go wrong that
evening with the art building. While
shaving in cold water. I asked if I
could have my suit and it was handed
to me—but the pants were missing.
At first I fought it was a joke. but
then it became nojokc.therc were no
pants. The time before dinner was
closing fast. and as I was supposed to
preside over introductions. the need
for punts had a priority. Bette. who
has to be one of thc mosl resourceful
wives. mocked with students in the
dorm to see if any had dark pants
somewhere near my sue but they
did not. We called nomctoscclfthcy
had fallen offth hanger. but they
had not. Somcplucc between home
and school I had lost the pants.

that parallels the academic podium
on the Washington Avenue side.
There in a blue cluster were about
nine Albany police ofﬁcers. The
police stopped as and said the road
was closed as the Governor was ex-
pected. This was thoroughly
frustrating. and as our story was
blurted out. I could see our position
was not only hopeless and
deteriorating. but ridiculous as well.
The police assumed that indulgent
star: that they use when listening to
pleas for mercy. We told them we
were looking for pants and they
agreed. but also reminded us that
their job was to protect the Gover-
nor. Aftcr all. if they let us pass to

the military implications of thesau-

not readily apparent. the more you
consider it the more absurd it

spirit of the absurd that the academic
and the military become one. My
own personal estimate of when the
two directions joined would be
around ﬁve years ago. Allowing for
human error. it is possible that I
could be off by some few weeks to a
