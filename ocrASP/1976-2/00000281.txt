wore a white cashmere sweater that
lifted her fulsome breasts apart like
the horns of a charging bull.
Through the space in the back of her
folding chair l watched her ass
everytime she moved; through the
light blue jeans I could tell her-
cheeks were as ﬁrm as watermelons.
As I gazed furtively from behind a
newspaper‘l had borrowed from the
lethargic telephone lineman who sat
next to me. I wondered why this
thing of beauty did not have a job.
She was ﬂipping through the pages
of the current Michener bestseller so
she could at least read and perhaps
write. For a moment I wished
fervently that l had a job myself: as
personnel director for any firm to
which this young Venus applied for
employment. I imagined the
interview: leaning back in my
Naugahyde chair after pouring her a
J & Band lighting her cigarette. I'd
skip the blowhard standards (“Why
do you want to work for Acme Paper
Box?) and get right to the point:
“You look likejust the type of girl

become our ﬁnest asset. You realize

but you can call me Dot." "You
realize Dot. that for a job of this
nature I must examine you without
your clothes on. You needn't be
embarrassed or-" but before I could
ﬁnish the air was full of ﬂying
clothes and she was rushing
opcnarmed over my desk. The
interview ended abruptly as a dumpy
little guy with false teeth. a goatee
and a perfunctory .‘ilnlll .illed Dot‘s
real name. Wilhelmena Gorbiner.
and escorted her behinda partition.
I remembered the first time I had
sat in this very same chair six weeks
before. when i had initially
registered for unemployment
beneﬁts. As a new registrant. i had
been required to stand in the longest
lines forthelongest time before I was
ushered behind the counter to wait
for the interview with an
Unemployment Counsellor. A
‘chunky woman. a public Mom in a
green and white checkered dress

desk. Her tnouseeolored hair was
done up in it permanent that looked
like it leafy bird‘s nest and she rcckcd

~ As i sttl there waiting for her to
initiate the interview. she casually
looked me over and jolted notes into
a giant looselcaf notebook. During

swore at myself for not having
brought a novel to read. I recalled
Idle Man once quoting Pascal to the
effea that all of man's troubles were
- the result of his inability to sit still in
a room. I realised now that it was
true because as I sat there at 4:50
v P. M. alone among twentyl'ive empty
chairs. while the state workers
cleaned off their desks. exchanged
pleasantries and left for home. and
even the darn telephones had
stopped ringing. as I sat there I felt
like leaping from my chair and
wildly attacking anyone within
reach. Outside l was numb as a
turtle. inside 1 was steaming.

Finally. the middleaged Mom
with whom I had originally
registered called my name. She riﬂed
through a jumble of forms as I sat
beside her desk in a cloud of eau de
cologne. antiperspirant. patchouli.
lavender balm. altar of gardenias
and parfum de bain which blended
into a mephitic stew of malodor.
“Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis."
she repeated as she leafed through
the papers. "Oh. here we
are . . . Oh. Oh my . . . “She fell
silent and frowned as she read the
memorandum. Then she typed a
statement declaring that I had been
signing Cromwell Hills
Construction to my claim slipfor the
past six weeks. When she askcdifthe
statement was accurate. Imentioned
the position in Sriudiu Arabia I had
applied for recently. She added that
to the statement in ii footnote and i
signed it. She closely examined my
signature as if searching for signs of
forgery. inhaling a deep breath and
announcing. “Mr. Lewis. it is my
unfonunrtte task to inform you that
you are no longer with us."

“With you?" i asked.

“With us." she said. “You have
abused the priviledges accorded you
by our office,“

"Abused?" I asked.

"Abused." she said. “To qualify

' “I understand." I said.
“Do you understand?“
"I understand.“
“Mr. Lewis. you are.now neither

“i am?"
“I am—l mean you are. or rather-
are not. ah. neither."
“Is there nothing I can do?"
"But I thought that is precisely t
what you have been doing. Oh my."
she said in surprise as she glanced at
her watch. “it's 5 o'clock and I must
get home. Good day. Mr. Lewis."
I walked away in a daze. as
stunned as if she had hit me on the
head with a 2“ x4“. somewhere inthc
back of my mind I had known this
was coming; I had seen the cards the
others submitted when they
collected their check. each with the
t names of six or seven companies

scribbled in the boxes. It would have
' been easy enough to read the want
ads once a week. telephone the ﬁrms
least likely to hire me and list their
names on the. card. but ljust hadn‘t
cared enough to bother. it didn‘t
llL'lln enough to me.

But this numbness. this emotional
drought was not so much it reaction
to being kicked offlhe dole line usit
was mute frustration at not having
had the opportunity to release the
rage that built up like a
thunderstorm inside me. having sat
in that drab office for four hours.

with this malodorous bearer of bad

tomatoes for her successful son the
engineer. a world in which she in-
sulated herself fromthc innumerable
people like me who confronted her
every day with their hardluck stories.
their despartttion. their pointless.

elderly museum guard talking to a
younger acquaintance around the
corner. “Hey John. take a look at
this ring.“

“Why it‘s a Masonic ring"

“Yeah. my brother's.”

“You don't say so. I'm a Recorder
of the Shrine.“

“I know. my brother told me.
that‘s why I showed it to you. He's a
thirty-third degree."

“No kidding."

“Yeah. he owns the Mobil station
at the corner of Washington and

“I know the one." Their footsteps
rhymed on the ﬂoortiles. their voices
trailed around a corner I could not

They had done the only work of
