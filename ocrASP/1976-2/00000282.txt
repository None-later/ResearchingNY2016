between a textbook and a

sample of the contents of what is
hoped to be a semesterly campus

The topic of this issue of Synthesis
is: “Crisis in American Higher
Education in the 70‘s." and when
viewed objectiver there indeed are
signiﬁcant questions brought up
within its pages. It is must-reading
for those with academic power at
SUNYA so that they at least con-
sider alternatives to the present
trends.

But for the average reader. t here is
too much material to plow through
before ideas can get across. Only the
preface and the first essay. by
Michael and Debra Kaufman, have
the potential to stimulate. The other
two essays are related to thctopic. in
a vauge sense. but are abstract and
difficult for all but the most serious.
There is nothing wrong with that.

It Cart Bernstein
Staten I Schuater 456pp.

The revelations contained in Bob
Woodward‘s and Carl Bernstein‘s se-
cond book. “The Final Days." are
not startling. After a period of in-
tense public scrutiny. Richard Nixon
has begun to assume his place in
history. and Americans, as
notoriously unconcerned with
history as our simian ancestors have
now moved on to different scandals.
Yet if this book reveals few secrets. it
does offer insight into a psy-
chology (Nixon's). and an institu-
tion (the Presidency).

The Watergate tapes of presiden-
tial conversations reveal Nixon as a
man enmeshed in a web of deceit.
“The Final Days" displays Nixon‘s
beliefs in his own innocence. We see
a dogged Nixon torn by indecision
and self-doubt. It is a tragedy. in the

strict Aristotlian sense: a man falls
from a height due to a tragic ﬂaw. in
Richard Nixon‘s case. his intense
paranoia. Around him are a cluster
of loyal aides. each seeking to
counteract the continuing onslaught
of defeats in the courts. in the press.
and finally in the congress.
Throughout it all. Nixon proclaim-
ed his innocence. and the govern-
ment floundercd.
This presidential indifference is a
most important part of the

Woodward-Bernstein book. It
