released by Governor Hugh L. Carey
earlier this week.  _ ‘ , -
“They seemed 'to_ honor our
needsﬁ‘x said Acting Vice President
for ‘Finance John Hartigan. “This is

I a painful reduction. but it is not an-

expected." he added.

The proposed budget would cut 57
positions at ,SUNYA. including five
instructional'positions. four in stu~

‘ dent affairs and aid. and twenty-two

in academic support. Most cuts will
be consistent with Task Force and

' Mission Study plans already made

on campus. “We don‘t expect any
retrenchment." said Hartigan.

WSUA-FMConstruction Cleared

by Paul ﬂosenthal

After eight years of repeated
attempts. WSUA is going FM. The
Federal Communications Commis-
sion has issued SUNYA a construc-
tion permit to build an FM radio sta-

~»a»;F€C. Broadcast Bureau Chief

Wallace Johnson informed SU NYA
of the acceptance by a telegram sent
Tuesday. On receiving the notiﬁca-

tion; [Associate Student Affairs.

DeanHRobert Squatriglia released

, the news to the campus with what he

called. "distinct pleasure."

The application for the permit was
submitted by the university one year
ago and was accepted for filing on
August 19. The efforts that led tothe
application began in January, 1975.

Ten Watts

The new station. whose call letters
have not as yet been designated. will
operate on a frequency of 90.9 mHz.
Licensed for an output of ten watts,
it will have a projected listening area
of three to four miles from the up-
town campus.

The new FM station will pick up
where WSUA. SUNYA‘s carrier
current station. leaves off. A large
portion of the Iatter's staff is ex-
pected to participate inthc construc-
tion and programming of the new
operation. according to WSUA Sta-
tion Manager Eric (ioldstein.

Goldstein said. “The vast amount

of work done toward achieving FM I

status was clearly a team eff ort." He
added “tlrnnkd to the WSUA staff.
the continued support of Student
Association. and the work ofthe 0f-
ficcs of Student Life and Student Af-
fairs." «
Goldstcin said there remains
much work before any broadcasts
from the FM station actually take
place. installation of equipment.
reconditioning of some. and con-
struction of studios is projected to
take at least several months. Golds-
tein hopes. however. that some test
broadcasts might go on the air dur-
ing this semester. ’
The FCC issued the construction

permit based on its decision that the '

new SUNYA station would not
cause interference with any existing

facilities in the Albany area. There

were reportedly no objections filed
with the Commission by any local

station. WAMC broadcasts at 90.3
mHz. while WRPI is at 9l.5 on the
dial.

Goldstcin said the FCC used

SUNYA‘s'application as a test case.

for stations in similar situations. and

“Further.” he noted. _“there were
delays in getting the application to
the‘ " Commission because? 'of
problems withﬁUNY-Central. But
the local administration here on
campus was instrumental in helping
us through these delays. and for this
we are grateful. i am hopeful that
future dealings with university locals
regarding problems of'construction
and space will also be handled ex-
pediently." A
Staff members expect tospend the
upcoming months developing a
program format that will best serve
SUNYA and the surrounding com-
-munity. Much of the broadcast day.
as on WSUA. will consist of popular
music presented in a somewhat
progressive style. Goldstein said. In
addition. great attention will be
focused on sports broadcasts. local
news reporting. and community-

.The station management also ex-

pects that some academic
departments will be willing and anx-
ious to help in the production‘of
educational programming.

News Feature
by 1.0. Feld~

When news of the telegram's
arrival reached the studios of WSUA
last Wednesday. there was a spon-
taneous outbreak of celebration
among the station's personnel.Peo-
plc jumped up and down like little
children in reaction to the culmina-
tion of nearly eight years of work in
attempting to obtain an FM license.
Although the station will probably
not be operating full time as an FM
station until the fall of '77. the

Sia‘te managers." It adds that thisfis’
consistent with Albany's effort to
' develop a closer link between the un-

iversity's instructional andresearchj

efforts and the' needs of the public
sector."

The budget notes that this ap-
propriation and one of 870.000 for a

Center for Governmental Research ~-

and Services “is more than offset by
other reductions.”

The document also assumes that
440 beds will be gained by converting
space in Mohawk Tower now used
by the Graduate School of Public
Affairs. Moving funds are included.

Summer Session would be cut
540.000. which Hartigan says could
mean reducing the number of
courses offered. ‘

Tighter Aid

Carey‘s budget also proposes
tightening up financial aid. Noting
that 7.000 students (out of 20.000)
decline their Regents Scholarship
awards each year. Carey proposes
that one million dollars be saved by
not reawarding the scholarships to
alternates. The budget notes that
“the State has no obligation to keep
offering these awards until someone
takes them.“ It also says. that the
scholarships are meant to promote

‘ it has taken nearly eight years of
empty promises to Central Council.
the Albany students. and most im-
portantly the station members
themselves to actually see the
Federal Communication Com-
mission's approval of therFM sta-
tion.

" For those station members who
have been around long enough to
know the frustrations of waiting to
turn.F M. thefe was a definite sigh of
relief and self-satisfaction in know-
ing that the station had at last
achieved what it set out to do eight
long years ago. The station‘s
Operations Director Randy Luck
could only say, "it's just peachy!"

For people like Randy. who have
spent four years working at WSUA
in the hope that it would soon get it‘s
license procedures worked out and
accepted by the FCC. the news was
sufficient, even though these folks
probably will never play a direct role
in the full time FM operation. But
still. the feeling was one of ac-
complishment.

“Even though we might not ex-
perience the actual operations of
WSUA-FM. the people who will
return next year will have the beneﬁt
of a station that can serve a real pur-
pose. serving the university com-
munity." said Luck.

To those who will return to an FM
station next year. tlfe reactions were
typified by the desire of one younger
station member who suggested.
“Let‘s all go down to the Rat and get

‘ wasted."

Clearly the mood around WSUA
has changed drastically. Realisticalv

. The Governor also. proposes -

minor revisions inxftlie TAB award

systems."'to save $6 million of the 

program's present Sl82 million cost.
The budget recommends that the
higher TAP scale again only be
available to students whograd'tﬁted
after Jan“. l. [974. This requirement
had been removed in I975.

“ Emancipation Awards"

Students who prove they are

emancipated from their parents
would receive awards on a special
scale under the l977-78 budget
proposals. Students who have a net
taxable income under SLOW would
not be effected. but that above that
level awards would drop sharplyup
to a net taxable income of $5.666.
where there would be no award.

ly. the station was little cared for,
both by the station members
themselves and by the Universityas a
whole. in fact. a great deal of

, students have probably never listen-

ed to WSUA. mostly due to the
nature of_ the station's AM transmis-
sion. The carrier current method
created noises that at most times
made the station unbearable to listen
to.

in recent years. the Albany
students had for the most part ig-
nored WSUA as an area radio sta-
tion. Even the station personnel
seemed to be going through the
motions ofattempting to runaradio
station that had decayingequipment
and a limited audience. Needless to
say. the morale around the'ltation
had not been very high.

But all that dramatically changed
when the word was released Wednes-
day ufternoon. it gave the older sta-
tion members a chance to reflect on
all those who had promised FM and
couldn‘t deliver and about the an-
