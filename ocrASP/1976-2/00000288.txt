why some students criticise campus

station faced each year from Central
Council when its' ettecutive staff was,
forced to keep pleadingfor patience.

Current Station Manager Eric
Goldstein took out a file perhaps a
half foot thick and began going
through documents that attested to
WSUA's eight. year attempt to
achieve its license.

Littleton Smith. WSUA's station
manapr in “69-70, had taken the
original steps in seeking from the
University to accept an FM station
on this campus. Smith was so confi-
dent of the process beingsshort one.
that he issued a memo in Sept. of
l970 assuring station members that
WSUA would be an FM station by
that Christmas. In addition. Central

New

Council, appropriated money to
WSUA in '70 in anticipation of the
station receiving its license in the
very near future.

Of course that never happened.
The station's executives soon‘realie-
ed. perhaps a bit too late. that the
procedures necessary to obtain an
F M license were far more complex
than any of them had ever an-
ticipated. Semesters went by with the
same old story and the same old ex-
cuse. “It's just argund the corner.”

With the license obviously going
nowhere and the station in deep
depression. the station's executives
in January l975 initiated yet another
and perhaps ,final attempt in ob-
taining the permission of the Univer-
sity and getting the proper work

A‘professional consultant. Ed
Perry. was hired and Associate Dean
of Student Affairs Robert
Squatriglia offered to work closely
with the Station's executive staff in
the hopes of finally realizing what
had become a dream.

With the help of these two men,
the former Working on the technical
aspects of the license. and the latter
involved in the administrative and
guidance function. the FM applica-
tion began to move again.

Goldstein summed up the good
news by saying that even though
muchwork remains to be done. we
can take some time out to ﬁnally put
to rest the long standing joke of
"FM-not in our lifetime."

Student Association plans 'to
charter buses at a reduced rate for
Students to the New York
metropolitan area after a dispute
with the American Enterprise Com-
pany forced cancellation of a similar
chartered buses prior to the interns-
sion break. according to SA Vice
President Gary Parker. .

“According to the Board I of
Trustees guidelines." said Parker.
“No private commercial enterprise is
allowed to use University property
for private profit." , .

The American Enterprise Co..
headed by senior Rich Lipson, had
been chartering buses for students at
vacation time for over three years.
Bus transportation was offered to
students at a reduced rate to various
points in Westchester. New York
City and Long Island.

According to Lipson. the com—
pany made about $500 at czlch vaca-
tion.

“I was aware Lipson was running
the buses last September." said
Parker, “I wasn‘t aware ofthc Board
of Trustees guidclincs until someone

in our research department showed

them to me after September."

[zl’nrkcn according to Lipson. first
opposed the chartered buses run by
the company before the Thanksgiv-
ing break.

“lie. denied “application '

for the wThsnksgivi'ng ‘rholidayﬂ ‘

said Lipson. “but allowed us to run
buses inajoint venture with Delta
Sigma [the business fraternity]."~w

The fraternity is a nonprofit
organization and therefore is not
subject to the Trustees‘ guidelines for
money-'inaking‘ operationsfon' cam-
pus.

“As far as I know. " said Parker.
“Lipson was hired by Delta Sigma to
work for them in't his instance. They
paid his as an individual."

The fraternity was not involved in
the chartering of intersession buses.

“I realized that Delta Sigma
wasn't going to run the buses."‘ said
Lipson. ‘ 7 V

Lipson then proceeded to charter
the buses himself and advertise with
the familiar posters boasting savings
in transportation costs.

Although the advertising posters
were put up at the beginning ofthc
week, Lipson did not formally bring
the solicitations application until
Dec. 7. the day bcforc'tickcts were to
go on sale.

“I thought that if Gary [Parker]

- reulizcd‘no buses were running andl

brought a solicitations application
to him at the last minute. he might
sign it." said Lipson.

~“Lipson called me at the last
minute." said Parker. “I told him

Lipson claimed that when he

Parker said that the inconvenience
was one of his major concerns. but'

did."

According to Parker. SA will

prices. “I am proud to say that we‘ll
be running buses in February at a
price never before seen on this cam-
pus.“ he said.
