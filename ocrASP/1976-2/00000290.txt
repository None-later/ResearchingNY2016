FEA Predicts
Heat Cost Rise

WASHINGTON (AP) You may
think your home heating bill this
winter is too high. but the Federal
Energy Administration predicts it
will nearly double by I985.

Most of the increase will be due to
inflation. said the FEA forcing
prices up some 58.4 per cent.

On top of that. the F EA estimated
that residential energy prices—a
weighted average of natural gas. fuel
oil. electricity and motor gasoline—
will increase an estimated 24 per
cent.

The increase could be higher if
foreign oil producers continue to
raise the prices of petroleum.

If oil prices climb about 2 per cent
a year. the F EA said. the residential
energy bill would rise about 3 per
cent a year or more than 30 per cent
by I985 on is compounded basis.

He saidvthe higher prices should
increase the amount of natural gas
available, permitting new homes to
use the fuel instead of installing ex-
pensive electric heat.

The residential energy forecasts
were part of a new FEA report on the
“national energy outlook.”

 .  DIMWITB .

, A judge in“ Londonhss jailed eight
marijuana smugglers aftei'brinding
them a bunch of “hopeless in-

: compe'tents" and suggesting a

slapstick movie should be made of
their exploits. ‘ ‘ ‘

The judge told the seven men and
one woman: “Everything you did

from start to ﬁnish was wrong. You v

did not know how to organize
things."

His remarks came at the end of the
pot-smuggling trial in London after
it was revealed that the caper began
on a wrong note in Morocco when
the ﬁrst "buyer" absconded with the
group‘s funds.

Gang members then proceeded to
nearly get busted by hiring the wrong
car; two members were later arrested
twice, in Morocco and Spain, but
bought their way out.

When one of the smugglers arriv-
ed at the London airport on his way
to purchase the pot. he was detained
by police for carrying more money
than Britons are permitted to take
out of the country.

In the end, according to the
testimony. the string of failures caus-
ed three gang members to have a ﬁst
fight in a hotel room. Police arrived
to investigate the ruckus, and
arrested the eight on smuggling
charges. The sentences ranged from
one to three years.

FUNNY FARM

study of future farming
developments. the report says that
the use of giant domes asyear-round
greenhouses for crops will be com-
mon, as well as orbiting weather
satellites to monitor crops and to
regulate soil conditions. A more

Popular Science Magazine is
reporting that giant turbines may

skyscrapers in U.S. cities. Author
Ben Kocival reports that some cities
may soon feature turbines as big as
1800 feet high and 600 feet wide, and
that “Their purpose will be even
more unusual than their looks.“ The
towers reportedly will be designed to
capture the wind, just us windmills
do, and turn it into human-made tor-

nados which will eventually produce '

electricity. The “Tornado Turbine,“
as it is called, will have small rotating
blades. but a much larger volume of

A new cengressional report warns
that the privacy of Americans is be-
ing seriously jeopardized by the U.S.

agency. based in Paris. which ex-
changes criminal and personal infor-

U.S. SLIPPING

The United States. once the
wealthiest nation on earth. has
slipped back into sixth place. The
World Bank. which keeps track of
such things, says Americans rank
sixth in percapita income behind the
citizens of ﬁve other nations.
Today's leaders in income per person
(in order) are Kuwait; United Arab
Emirates; Katar: Switzerland;
Sweden; and then the U.S. The
World Bank says that both Den-
mark und Norway will probably
move past the U.S. within the next

WITCHY-WASHY

Richard Nixon has been offered
the chance to play the part of the
wicked witch in an x-rated version of
“The Wizard of Oz.“ Movie
producer Bill Osco, who also recent-
ly put together an adult version of
“Alice in Wonderland,“ says be
wired Nixon in San Clemente with
the acting offer. The proposed con-
tract cails for a minimum of SW).-
000 if the ex-president will agree to
his ﬁlm-acting debut. Osco predicts
that Mr. Nixon‘s appearance would
generate popular interest in the film.
Needless to say. the former president
has not yet responded.
