Campus Radio Tuning In On FM

by Spence Reggie

SUN YA‘s radio station, WSUA-
AM received notice from the FCC
on August 13 that their application
for FM status has been accepted.

Expressing optimism and foresee-
ing no major problems, news direc-
tor l’aul Rosenthal said thatthe con-
struction permit should arrive some
time in November. and \VSUA
should be a‘ full-time station in
March.

It‘s been over a year since the
application left the station.
Although the usual waiting period.
before acceptance or rejection of an
application, is about six months. the
WSUA application has been in
bureaucratic limbo for over a
yearStation manager. Eric Golds-
tcin said that there was a delay
because of WSUA‘s possible in-
terference with adjacent stations
WAMC in Albany. and WRl’l in
Troy. The FCC used the WSUA-FM
application as a test case to force an
opinion on this problem of in-
terference. Until now. cases en-

countering this problem were ar-

bitrarily decided without official
policy guidelines from the commis-
sion. WSUA‘ii application was used.
according to Goldstein. because it
was well put together, and clearlyad-
dressed the interference problem.

Technically. a ten watt FM station
on campus will interfere with
WAMC and WRl’l. But according
to the opinion released by the FCC.
“the calculated ~ interference
area. . .lies around the proposed
tower and above an assumed 30-foot
high receiving antenna.“ ’ u

The commission decided that it
was “meaningless to talk about in-
tet'ferencc over the 30-foot level" and
ordered that WSUA‘s application
for a spot at 90.9 on the FM dial be
accepted.

Appropriations Advanced

in anticipation ol'thc construction
permit. Central Council has already
appropriated $30,000 for building
expenses. a figure which Goldstein
says will have to be “drastically in-
creased" it' it is to cover all building
and equipment costs.

The money for the actual opera-

VWith 33 yacant pesitions stiffed by
a state budget hiring freeze. the
SUNYA Library has cut ‘its
operating hours by 20 per cent.

The Library has been left
shorthanded since the hiring con-
straint prevents the filling of vacan-
cies created by attrition this past
year.

Library Director James
Schmidt meeting this week with
SUNYA Acting Executive Vice
President David Martin has agreed
to hire student assistants in an effort
to restore the Library hours lost.

According to Martin the students
will be paid from temporary service
money and a change in Library
hours is expected for Tuesday. Mar-
tin_ said. “We‘re going to do a littl

patching here and there." -‘ '

Central Council member Rich
Greenberg. who met with Martin
yesterday. said that two supervisory
positions are being unfrozen in order
to train the student workers.

Open l03.5 hours weekly last year,

the Library is now operatingen 83.!
hour week. The hours were. cut
primerin during the evening. and on
Saturday and Sunday. ‘

Schmidt'said there are other dif- .

ficulties besides shorter hours
created by the vacancy freezing.

"We‘ve got work backed up and
we've got some morale problems.”
Schmidt said.

Schmidt has requested the un-
freezing of 19 of the 33 positions.
which has been endorsed by the
SUNYA Classification Committee.
an internal review board. The re-
quest is now at SUNY Central and if
approved then proceeds to the Divi-
sion of Budget for New York State.

When asked about the outcome of
his unfreezing request. Schmidt said.
"I think the need for them (the
positions) is unarguable." He said.
“The students need the hours."

As of now the Library hours are:
Monday through Thursday from
7:30 am. to lo pm. Saturday from
l0a.m. to 5 pm. Sundayfrom I pm.
to 9 pm.

SUN Y Plan Outlines Mission

by Betty Stein

A new SUNY master plan calling
for undergraduate education reform
and focus on public service was
released this summer by Chancellor
Ernest Boyer. ,

'i'he four-year plan calls for the
“mission"—a
statement of pttrposei—On each cam-
ptts. and a sharp reduction in enroll-
meat. with a new emphasis on
transfer admissions between SUNY
schools.

At a press conference coinciding
with the release of the general.
trendsetting report. lloyer said that
liberal education must be clearly
defined to end the “great confuaion
as to the skills and attitudes an
educated person should possess.“

Among the programs outlined to
effect the goal were so-called “new
liberal education models" on five
SUNY campuses, and a proposed

national symposium on the same:

topic.

The return of distribution re-
quiremcnts. seen by many as a
method of achieving a common base
of knowledge. probably would not
be implemented. according to the
chancellor. lnstettd. courses on
"future trends" might be offered. he
said. ,

Boyer said a new 1980 enrollment
estimate of 187.500 is part of his plan
to “stabilize the ratio between
students attending SUNY and those
attending the state's private in-
stitutions." This figure reﬂects a
decrease of 18,200 from the last
master plan enrollment projections
in 1972.

All those with SUNY ‘ ‘
degrees will be guaranteed admis-
sion to a four year program, accor-
ding to the plan. “Community
colleges may become the place where
most people begin their education.
regardless of achievement level."

 

said Master Plan Development
director Michael Reynolds.

Boyer admits that the new public
service thrust. which would include
the formation of a university-
industry liason panel. to put the
state‘s intellectual resources in the
hands of business. was not complete-
ly his own idea. “There's been a very
