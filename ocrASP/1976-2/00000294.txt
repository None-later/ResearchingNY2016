Upon investigation, it was found
that RCO Department Chairman
Dr. Philip Tompkins. in submitting
his textbook request had inadver-
tantly requested the RCO 369 text
for the RCO l00 course. This nor-
mally would not pose much of a
problem, but a few students involved
in this dilemma either wrote their
names in the book or lost their

According to Budget Officer
Harold Drink the University can‘t
oppose the legislature‘s decision
“without legal hassles." He sees no
real reason for doing so considering
the money was passed in a
supplemental budget and doesn‘t
take money away from other depts.

In effect, according to Brink. the
University has to comply with such
legislative intent. and this has caused
some concern within the .tdiiiinistra-

“I hope it‘s not a precedent." said
Drink. “The campus is concerned

SASU Organizes Drive

For Voter

by Cynthia Haclnli

Central Council voted on
Wednesday night to finance the
Voter Registration Drive being held
here beginning September 8.

The drive is part of a statewide
campaign to register and educate
potential voters.

Tcntutivcly scheduled to be held in
the Assembly Hall. four half kegs,
snacks. and a folksinger will be on
hand as well as a comprehensive
selection of campaign literature to
explain the positions of the can-
didatcs.

"We want it to be a celebration-
type atmosphere . . . a place where
those who have already registered to
feel that it‘s good they did—and a
place for them to learn about the
candidates.“ said Kathy Baron of
SA. "Ofcourse we want to get people
to register as well." Baron
characterized the educational part of
the drive as strictly non-partisan.

Current efforts to register student
voters here are concentrated in the
Colonial Quad U-lounge. where
mail-in registration forms and
absentee ballot forms are available.

Registration

Also in the lounge is a SASU stu-
dent voter questionnaire covering
various issues. A comparable
questionnaire has been sent to can-
didates for the New York State
Senate and Assembly. According to
Executive vice president of SASU,
Diane Piche, half of these have
already been returned.

The results of both the student and
candidate questionnaires are to be
published in a SASU statewide
newspaper in October.

Council also passed a bill
allocating $100from SA's Emergen-
cy linctothe American Voter Educa-
tion Fund. The money is intended to
help finance legal action contesting
the law which prohibits students
from registering in the county Where
they attend college.

Slated for the future is the annual
SASU media press conference. Open
to all media in the SUNY system,
SASU wants to draw the major
presidential candidates to the con-
ference. According to Piche, Carter
campaign people have already con-
tacted SASU and shown interest in
the conference.

Beame said with it broad grin.

In his “clectiongram” Ford warn-
ed that if Carter is elected the
Democrats "will give us on a

national scale the same kind of all-
out welfare state government that
has been so disastrous in New York
City and has brought England tothe

The plea for funds to whip the
