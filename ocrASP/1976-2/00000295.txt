Court Keeps Bone From Dog

WASHINGTON (AP) A Federal
Judge on Wednesday temporarily
blocked government regulations
which permit food processors toadd
bone bits and simmered fat to meat
products. including hot dogs. cann-
ed beef stew and lunch meats.

U.S. District Judge William B.
Pryant issued a temporary restrain-
ing order against the Agriculture
Department rules, first issued last
spring and constested by consumer
orgamutions.

At issue were two food industry

practices designed to use more of
each livestock carcass in their meat
products.
' In one, called mechanical debon-
tng, bones with meat scraps attached
are ground up and pushed througha
sieve. Larger pieces of bone are
screened out. but smaller particles
remain within the meat which goes
to consumers.

In the second. fatisslowiy melted
at relatively iow“ternperatures—
below l20 degrees. The liquid is
poured off and the residue is then in-
cluded as an ingredient in frozen piz-
za, corned beef, beef patties and
other products.

Government attorneys said,
however, they believe meat
processors will be premitted to con-
tinue using the contested processes
while legal maneuvering continued.

Consumer lawyers said if that
happened. they would seek a new
court order specifically requiring the
department to halt the parctices as
being in violation of federal laws

emailing the purity of meat.
Federal law prohibits adding
mailing to meat which would

bone and fat is within the accepted
definition of meat.

Consumer advocates say the
residual fat process is run at such low
temperatures that the end product is
dangerously susceptible to bacterial
tnfection. They also argue that
products with the resulting
“simmered fat" have less nutritional
value than regular lean meat such as
ground beef.

On Aug. 23, Asst. Agriculture
Secretary Rich L. Feitner said the
department “has discovered no
evidence to establish that
mechanically deboned meats would

cause meat food product. . .to be

unwholesome or unhealthfui or

otherwise underrated."
Informal Permission

Until last spring. the department
had for IS months been informally
permitting meat processors to use
the two controversial methods both
of which take advantage of new
technology in the food industry.

There was no public disclosure.

in May. the department issued in-
terim regulations ilnd set out a plan
for rules allowing both practices to
go into permanent use in the fall
probably by Oct. ts. ’
I Consumer groups protested and
were turned down by the depart-
ment. They took their casetofederai

U.S. officials say he will also urge.
Vorstcr to withdraw South African
troops from the territory and totakc
steps respecting the human rights of
Namibia's 800.000 black in~
habitants.

Thes officials give the impression
that if Kissinger hzts any success in
Zurich it will be with regard to
Namibia. the former German
territory administered by South
Africa in defiance of the United
Nations.

South Africa is Rllodcsiu's prin-
cipal lifeline. and Vorster is
Kissingcr's pipeline to Rhodesian
Prime Minister Ian Smith‘s white-
minority government.

There is little prospect that
Kissinger will make progress on
Rhodesia during his visit with
Vorster. officials believe. There is
considerable doubt in some in-
formed quartcrs that Vorster is
training his persuasive powers on
Smith.

Officials acknowledge privately
there is still no signal from Smith
that he is prepared to yneld power
within two years of negotiations with
Rhodcsiu‘s black iiberationists.

Flatly ruled out is a face-to-fuce
meeting between Kissinger and
Smith. The United States considers
the Rhodesian government to be il-
legal.

As for Namibia. the proposal bya
multiracial committee for in-
dependence by the end of I978 is
viewed as a hopeful opening.

The committee made no reference
to elections in its report. and the
South-West African Peoples'
Organization SWAPO did not par-
ticipate in the deliberations.

It is on these points that Kissinger
sees a possibility of making

 

headway.
