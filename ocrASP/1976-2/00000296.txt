CONTRACARPOTB

Can preventing pregnancy be as
simple as avisittothe garden patch?

Scientists in India are suggesting
this possibility. According to
researchers at India's Rajasthan
University, chewing dry carrot seeds
can prevent women from becoming
pregnant.

The researchers state the method
has been used as a birth control for
generations in Rajasthan. and
laboratory tests show the carrot seed
provides the same function as the
agent used in birth control pills.

To say nothing of what it does for
night vision.

STYMIED WHALERS

The Greenpeace Foundation, the
conservation group that has been
using small rubber boats to interrupt

whale-killing attempts by Soviet
fleets, has apparently been
successful.

A spokesperson for the Soviet
Government has announced in
Ottawa that Russian ships will cease
all whaling within two years.

Nikolai Makarov. a Soviet
Minister in Ottawa. explained that
whaling will be abandoned because
of its serious “Political
Consequences."

 

SOUVENIR PLOT

'lf you haven't bought your
Bicentennial souvenir yet, you might
want a piece of Abraham Lincoln‘s
farm.

The farm of the l6_th president of
the United States—who went to war
rather than split up the nation—is
now being subdivided into square
inch pieces and sold for $5.00 apiece.

Deeds to the 34-acre property. the
only farm Lincoln ever owned.
entitle the buyer to access to the
land. but owners may not take
personal possession of their square.

In case your history is shaky,
Lincoln‘s farm is near Charleston in
East Central Illinois. where he grew
up. *

SMOGTREES

Residents of Los Angeles and
other pollution filled cities can soon
take heart: a scientist with New
York’s Botanical Gardens is
attempting to discover a whole line
of trees which actually love the
smog.

The scientist, Doctor David
Karnosky. reports he has set up a
large fumigation chamber. where
maple. ash. and other trees will be
given large doses of sulfcr dioxide
and ozone. two of the main
ingredients in smog.

The shrubs which come out alive
after three hours of breathing the
polluted air will then be transported.
or even grown from scratch, to
places like New York City or Los
Angeles where gardeners are having
a hard time finding trees which can
still breathe the polluted city air.

HEHOINE HELP

San Diego could become the ﬁrst
county in the United States to offer
heroin at low cost to addicts.

In an unprecedented move, a
county grand jury last month issued
a scathing attack on the Federal
Government‘s Methadone
Maintenance Program. calling it a
dismal failure. The jury then
instructed county officials to ask the
state and federal government for
permission to sell heroin to addicts
at low cost instead of using
methadone. a supposedly less
harmful substitute for the real drug.

San Diego County officials are
currently considering the grandjury
recommendation. Some have
predicted that if Federal and State
authorities grant permission for the
unusual sales. heroin addicts would
flock to San Diego from all over the
country.

Heroin is currently distributed in
several European countries under
government supervised programs
which seek to prevent addicts from
resorting to robbery and voilent
crimes in order to support their drug
habits.
