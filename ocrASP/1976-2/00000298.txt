This semester‘s ﬁlm selections
offer both the ridiculous end the
majestic: the popcorn crunching
commercial successes. (which some
misguided souls believe is ‘cincma‘)
and the individualized visions of
serious ﬁlmmakers. You may seduce
your new sweetheart during Walking
Tall II, but if you are up for the
intellectual strain. Carl Dreycr‘s
Gertrude can prove the more
rewarding cinema experiean Yes,
we do have quite a choice to'make
this year concerning the type of film
to View: one ofthe usual Hollywood—
trash-cntcrtainment or one of
significant motion picture valuc.
Some of us will improve our Filmic
sense while others will join the
masses who don’t give a thought
about how they waste a good Friday
evening. '

commercial productions. How else

The two exhibitions currently at
the SUNYA Art Gallery are Sons
.1an Others: Women A rtt‘str See Men
and the Annual Faculty Exhibition.

The Faculty Exhibition reveals
the continuing dominance of the
style known as photo-realism. This
work, part of the tradition of
American tromp/‘oei/ (fool the eye)
began with Rembrandt Peale
and extended through Pete and
Andy Warhol. A reaction against
minimalist and anti-art trends,
photo~rcalism continues tocxpress a

Seduction of Mimi and Swept
Away. This female master director
has recently been sweeping both the
European and American art film
houses with her keen and dedicated
sense of poetry and cinematic
excellence. She uses the close-up
with the same command and vigor as
Von Strohcim and Griffith did
decades ago. She relates her
message. her vision and her passion
through a camera‘s lens and a sharp
editing scissors (a method which has
certainly been forgotten in most of
our current films). There is also Ken
Russell‘s The Devils. which,
although sometimes over-indulgent,
is remarkably original. And
Slang/tIt'rltuttxt' 5 is well worth an
additional viewing.

The International I-'i|m Group
presents us with the more interesting
and unique film experience. First
there is a classic early Hitchcock,
lllt' .l/ttn Who Knew Too Much. tltc
British tIiriIIct' which launched its
dircctor‘s name to fame. Next. there
is a fine Carol Reed double bill, Ottr
Mth in Havana and The Third Man.
Alt hough less distinguished than the
latter. Ottl' Matti" Havana, is Reed‘s
most personal film. Based on a novel
by Graham Greene, it is filled with
graceful understatement, humanity
and sincerity. This is the best double
bill you will see this semester.

The German cinema is well
represented too with a return of Von
Sternberg‘s The [Jim Angel, the I929

devotion to objects. The painterly
style is highly ﬁnished and the
perspective seeks to draw the
observer into the picture plane.
William Wilson's works are
variations on this old theme. His
Cannery Row is composed of two
separate tromp l‘oeil planes,
confounding the perceptions of the
observer. He has naturally chosen
the can. that l’op icon, as his
plaything. In Can-Can, we observe
Wilson's use of super-space. on
compressed planes. Look-See
depicts ordinary objects pinned or

The Class or the C I!

Dietrich-Jennings classic. Most
impressive, however. is The
Threepenny Opera. the ﬁrst sound
ﬁlm by Georg W. Pabst, one of the
ﬁnest directors in the history of the
cinema. Besides the direction of
Pabst, this masterwork has a host of
important contributors; among
which are the playwright and com-
poser Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill.
the screenwriter—film theorist Bela
Balazs and the incredible director of
photography, Fritz Arno Wagner.

There are two Roman Polanski
works, Rt’])lll.tf()n and Rosemary's
Baby, which the IFG is presenting.
For those interested in this director's
work, it ntust bcsuid Mr. Polanski is
capable of much better cinema. The
serious tone of his fine Polish work
has somehow been replaced by a
Hollywood slickness, beginning with
[repulsion and culminating in
China/mm. As with Fritz Lang and
Alfred Hitchcock. the glamor and
excitement of big studio production
proved too inviting for Polanski and
his art suffered. These two thrillers.
however. are impressive enough for
a viewing.

You will be able to see the great
Garbo in Camille followed the next
week by the powerful and shattering
performances of Liv Ullman and
Bibi Andersson in Bergman‘s
Persona. This Swedish classic is one
of Bergman‘s last truly cinematic
works.

And Sculpted, Steel

fastened onto a super-real sky.

Mark Greenwold‘s use of photo-
realism in Bright Promise is quite
exciting. He depicts a teenage girl‘s
bedroom in which a highly erotic
encounter takes place. The attention
to detail is phenomenal and makes a
jarring impact on the viewer.

The art of Lithography is
represented by Richard Callner's
group of works. His Lilith is
composed of strong curvilinear
forms that seem to grow from a
single point of origin.

Certainly the finest work in the

Finally, the IFG is giving us Carl _
Dreyer's Gertrude. a ﬁlm which is
not often shown on college
campuses. It is a fascinating work
which completely took cinema
enthusiasts by surprise when it was
released in I964. This ﬁlm is almost
devoid of physical action, the
camera concentrating entirely on the
interplay of speaking characters. In
this his last motion picture, Dreyer
abandons camera movement and
cutting and replaces it with a
profound and ﬁnal expression of

show belongs to Richard
Stankiewicz. His untitled works of
Mild Steel are powerfully
expressive. Mass is set against mass,
curve against angle and plans
against plane. He has borrowed
freely from the cubist heritage, but
has transformed the elements into
uniquely original forms that make
full use of his medium. The work is
not free standing, but is set flat
against the wall, yet the object's mass
is fully asserted.

Alek Markoff examines mass in
an entirely different manner. His
chairs and cubes have been
compressed so that they take on a
perspectival distortion. We are
looking at space as well as the objects
themselves. The result is viewer
confusion and ambiguity.

gained a considerable following ‘

abroad; his humanism and love for
the cinema has evolved a personal
style which has made him one of the
most important foreign directors in
recent years.

Others; Women Artists See Men, is
less successful. An attempt to place
men in the portrait roles
traditionally assigned to women, the
results are often guilty of the same
offenses; cliche and contrivancc. A
few of the works are full of
bitterness. Jaunita McNecIy’s
Merry-Go-Round II is an angry
denunciation of the male-female
role. A silkscreen by May Stevens,
Big Daddy Paper Doll is more
succcSSful. Her control of line and
color are excellent and combine to
make a powerful image.
