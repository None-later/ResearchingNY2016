Since I have always preferred
making plans to executing them, I
have gravitated towards situations
and systems that, once set into
operation, could create music with
little or no intervention on my part.
That is to say. I tend towards the
roles of planner and programmer,
and then become an audience to the
results—Brian Eno
Brian Eno is an’avant-garde artist
and non-musician Who just happens
to hang out around music. On the
whole, I only listen to avant-garde
music (and classical andjazz forthat
matter) to show off my eclectic
erudition. in real life. i prefer stuff
that‘ll suck my brains out of the little
air-holes in my sneaks~rock&roll,
in other words. But while Eno‘s
modus operandi tends to be icily
cerebral. when it's time to kick, he
can kick pretty though. As an
“enthusiastic amateur and dabbler"
he seems to be the only person
around right now who is not only
bristling with ideas but also not at all
timid about recording them.

An early project was the
Portsmouth Sinfonia. whose two
light classical albums he produced.
The guiding philosophy behind the
Sinfonia was that one should not be
deterred from playingthe musicthat

correct the situation. he began to
hear the record not as music. but as
just one part of tho general hum of
life around him.

The lengthy title cut on his album
is an attempt to recreate this
experience. The music cases in and
out of your awareness. slipping
down to a level of perception a half-
step below that of background
music. The melody is completely
forgetable, but its calming effects are
delicious. Eno‘s material
contribution to the piece is minimal.
He supplied tapes of two brief
melodic passages ofdifferinglengths
and sent them through a long-delay
echo unit. allowing them to repeat
and weave together indeﬁnutely on
their own.

Side Two consists of .“Three
Variations on the Canon in D Major

tiny fragments from the original
score and assigns each player a
different tempo so that his part is
continuously overlapping with the
parts of the other players in new
ways. Simple, eh'.’ The effect is full

and lush and very pleasurable. but
not ill all similar to the calming
sensation produced by the
subliminal workings of “Discreet
Music." and therefore not as
intriguing.
