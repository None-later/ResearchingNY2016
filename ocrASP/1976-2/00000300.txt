Comments ranged from
“Amazing.” to “i don't believe
it," to “It's about time."

What students were referingto
was the newly renovated
Rathskeller pub. Complete with
everything from carpeted and
quarry tile ﬂoor to fancy wood
dropped ceilings, the Rat has
taken on the appearance of an
off-campus tavern rather than a
“last—resort“ hangout for
students with nothing better to
do.

The Rathskcller ﬁrst began to
assume its new appearance last
year with the addition of a
cocktail bar. Next came 'the
replacement of the traditional
picnic tables and benches with
antique wood tables and chairs.
This summer has seen the
addition of a raised carpeted
lounge area as well as six stand-
up bars.

Yet, more improvements are
still in the making. A service bar
is presently being installed next
to the snack bar with a direct
hook-up to the kegsin a soon-to-
be-completed walk-in cooler
[rather than the present method
of rolling out each keg as
needed].

A delicatessen is due for
completion sometime next
month. This will mean the

addition of cold cuts and other

the new rathskeller In its initial phases

"deli-delights" to' the usual
lunchtime selection. There will
also be take-out orders and
catering service.

.The Rat will continue to
supply live music Thursday.
Friday and Saturday nights, with
Tree Fox being this weekend’s
band. Plans are in the works for
at least one special attraction per
month (such as an Oktoberfest.
or last year’s green beer on St.
Patrick‘s Day) in addition to the
regular bands.

Hours are from noon (2:00
p.m. on Sunday) to 11:30 p.m.
Sunday through Wednesday,
noon to l2:30 am. Thursday.
and noonto l:30a.m. Fridayand
Saturday nights.

The designs for the "New Rat”
were conceived. and
construction completed by
Harris A. Sanders. Architects.
The money was supplied by a
budget supplement from the
Universtiy Auxiliary Service
Corporation. It is hoped that
these new facilities will bring
enough new revenue to offset the
cost of construction.

in the words of Paul Arnold.
Assistant Manager of the
Campus Center. “The
Rathskeller is not in business to
make money. We are here as a
service to the students. and I
hope that they will make the
most of it in the coming year."
