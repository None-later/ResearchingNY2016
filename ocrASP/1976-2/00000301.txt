oym'htm came down hard on
YPIRG tactics in this July I inter-
Icw with the organization's stole
hairpmon, Chris Aidan. Theinter-
m was purl of N I’FIRG's effort to
pile profiles of N. Y; hopefuls-far
he U.S. Senate.

'oynihsn: You're a public interest
' earch group and your interest is to
Icit vieWs from public officials.
no you‘re a group that has its
'gins in Ralph Nader's work in
ashington, and Ralph is a young
in n I brought to Washington many

  
   

s
f years ago. and I had somethingto do
with his career. I’ve been in public
life most of my life. I say in response
that your questions have very frank-

ly disappointed us. They came to me
like something you would get on a

freshman course in comparative
government in a not very good com-

munity college. Yes and no
questions. multiple choice. with
respect to what are in fact complex
issues of public policy. I wrote to
you, and Professor Weaver who first

responded — this is my associate: we

taught together at Harvard/she now
teaches at Yale. She's spending the
summer working with us — Uh.
when we said, “Well, here‘s our
response." and to get a lot of bicker-
ing from you about whether you will
publish the whole thing is myidea of.
and then you have to say “blank.
blank" in your communications. I
:will say to Cauficld. and I will put it
ion this tape. I wish you would pay
attention to the mode of inquiry
which was . established by the

‘ Citizens Union half a century ago

and you are, how old are you sir?
FCIIris: I‘m twenty.

M: Twenty. And where do you go to
school?

M: Albany State. Well. Albany State
is not a bad school. its not the best,
but one of the first that got into the
state university system. Now at
Albany State I would hopethey will
make an effort to teach you in the
course of four years that there are
very few questions towhiehthere is a
yes or no answer possible. and I
would hope you would learn to in-
quire into the work of the Citizens
Union. which has been here for a
very long time and has taken very
great pains to try not to intimidate
public people which you are doing.
Mr. Caufield. you know. gave me
this lawyer stuff. and so fourth. but
to try and find out what they think
and give no. not the slightest sugges-
tion that there will be some punish-
ment for not doing so. Because you
are not in any. you have no claim on
us. our time. and if you are tryingto
perform a public service. perform a
public service. not a service of ego
gratification.

C: What three issues do you con-
sider top priority for legislative ac-
tion during the next session’.’

M: Of what‘.’

C: Of the Senate.

M: Of the Senate. of the Congress
you mean. Uh. I would think the
Humphrey-Hawkins issue would he
first. health insurance would be se-
cond. and I would think.and those
are in terms of what would he first
and second. and my hope is that the
Family Assistance Plan. IIRI. will
be third.

C: What should be our foreign
policy toward South Africa and
Rodesia'.’

M: That‘s not it good question. Uh.
Uh. . .it‘s just not it good question.

our foreign policy? Do you want to
write, you‘re talking to a man who
has been an ambassador three times.
do you want a five word answer?
C: Well. . .

M: The foreign policy should be ap-
proximately that which I set foward
in my position with South Africans
about their violation of human
rights. We_ were the first people to
come forward with it in a very ex-
plicit and detailed way.

C: How can we best progress toward
US—USSR disarmament?

M: Toward disarmament. we‘re not
anywhere near disarmament. we‘re
at most in the middle of the second
phase of SALT and disarmament is
the third and very prospective phase
of SALT and I‘m not sure SALT I
was that successful and SALT II is
still very problematic. That‘s not a
very good question.

C: Should Congress beempowered
to Veto weapons sales to foreign
nations by industry or the federal
government“! Why? .

M: Uh. I consider. that raises poten-
tial of anti-semitism in this country.
which appalls me.

C: I‘m not sure I understand. . .
M: Well then you don‘t know much
about this subject. Youshouldn‘t ask
the question. In any event. the word
veto is not a word you use with
respect to the President. with respect
tothc Congress. . .(unintelligiblc.).
I care too mu_eh about the issue of
Israel and indeed of a dozen coun~
triesinvolvcdtowislttogive. . .The
President has to be Commander-in:
Chief. conductor of our foreign
policy. the Congress certainly shoud
establish .ules in these matters and it
has done so. but to use that word the
way you‘ve done suggests that you're
anti-Israel and I don‘t like that. I

C: Do you favor increased supervi-

M: I think we have almost total

C: There are guidelines now. Some
people have said that they thought
they were too vague.

M: Who said that?

C: Uh. . .

M: Who said it? You don't even
know who said it.

C: I can't say.

M: You don't even know what ques-
tion you're answering. asking. You
don‘t know the questions. it's not
your fault. but we've hadthirty years
of very. very. detailed complications

vague. If they are vague. they ought
not to be. but it is not myimpression
that they are. But in any event. you
do not know who says they are and
you do not know what regulations
you are referring to. Don't ask (rais-

with respect to the AEC. Well it‘s not
even AEC now. it's ERDA I guess
mostly would be involved. . .There
would be some military movements
into NATO. . .but you don't know
your question, so don‘t ask it.

C: Do you support the establishment
of a federal agency to represent Con-
sumer interests before other federal
agencies and the courts?

M: I‘m not sure I do. I‘m not sure I
don't. I take the position of the

is the position that I thinkg at this
point. I'm a member of the platform

are victims of such frauds as price

program which would cut an es-
timated I.4 million persons from the
program and liberalize benefits for
recipients in the lowest income
brackets?

'M: Who‘s the sponsor of the bill?
