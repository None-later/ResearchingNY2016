aeniing with bills. they have
matters. There are ﬁve such bills in
The Congress. You must understand
first there are five such bills right
how. If you don‘t know the name of
the Senator who is the main sponsor,
it you don‘t know the number, if you
don't know the other co-sponsors,
you don't know the question you are
asking.

"C: Should natural gas prices be sub-
ject to decontrol? If so how quickly
should they be decontrolled? .

M: That‘s a curious question. Suze,
the argument has been made that
prices have been kept too low to
develop sources. And suddenly we
get this formulation: well, let‘s take
all regulation off entirely. . .
Weaver: ?

M: Are you saying .that all people
who are using natural gas in their
homes tlteir prices would be
doubled? l atn against, put it down.
uncontrolled increases on the prices
of natural gas being used by con-
sumers at this point. l would like to
know whether this would he the
result of decontrolling, which I
assume it would be. the price of
natural gas. I am a consumer ad-
vocate.

C: Should ceilings on prices of
domestic oil continue?
M: Yes.

C: What programs would your
recommend to ensure efﬁcient
energy consumption in the U.S.?

M: Don‘t be ridiculous. Don‘t be
ridiculous. (laughter). You‘re talking

about the nature of the.twentieth'

century economy.

C: I‘m talking about conservation
measures.

C:_No.

M: Neither am I. What are you
studying?

C: Economies.

M: Economics. You are not yet an
economist. Please don‘t ask
ridiculous questions.

C: Would you support an amend-
ment to the Clean Air Act that would
allow more time to meet emission
deadlines for auto and industrial
plants? Why?

M: Uh. yes. I‘m always in favor of
that much discretion.

C: Any specific reasons?

M: I think that the costs ofenergy in
the industry have changed some of
the cost-benefit rations. We've quin-
tupled the price of energy and that‘s
a change. That should suggest more
flexibility.

C: Would you support the 'l'oxic
Substance Control Act which would
authori/c the Environmental
Protection Agency to require testing
of chemicals prior to marketing. and
limit use?

Weaver: (Comments that she is utt-
certain about the standards of safety
employed).

M: Where's the Federal Trade Com-
mission? I‘ll tell yott this. pttt me
down as saying: I gave Ralph Nader
his first job and I‘m not in favor of
tnorc bureaucracy. I don't know why
we keep having to increase the
number of people regulating the
regulators. I think you‘re getting into
a very uneasy setting there. I believe
fundamentally in this. but you‘re get-
ting regulators to regulate regulators
to regulate reglators. And the coun—
try is turning off It: this. And if you
want the countrytodosokcepitup.

: Yes.

C: Why?

M: Most sessions are open anyway.
C: Do you believe there should be
exceptions? .

M: There always will be whether you
think there should be or not.

C: Do you have any special feelings
about that yourself?

M: Nope.

C: Do you favor pending legislation
which requires stricter registration
requirements and dollar disclosure
for lobbyists?

M: Yes.

C: Do you support the Humphrey-
Hawkins Bill?
M: Yes.

C: Do you approve of the current
methods for disbursing federal
revenue-sharing funds? Should the
funds be continued. How would you
distribute the funds?

M: Yes.

M: Yes. I started it.

What are the current methods?
Would you like to describe to what
they are?

M: NO. there aren't two formulas.
there's one formula. How could
there be two formulas? You don't

C: Revenue sharing as l understood
it. . .

M: l'herc's only one formula. That is
the law that is in place. There are
proposals that are different. but
there is only one formula. We have
revenue sharing. . . (unintelligible)

offenders? Why?

M: What kind ofa question is that?
Do I think there is a rising crime
rate? ls there or is there not a rising
crime rate?

(7: lt would depend upon your inter-
pretation. . .

M: Well. I will tell you the data.
Some is going up and some crime is
going down. What‘s the second part

M: What do you rnean treatment?
C: In terms of punishment for per-

M: It you mean punishment. why
don't you say punishment not
treatment? I think that there is no
question in my mind that if more
persons who committed crimes were
arrested. sentenced, punished for
them, there would be less crime.
