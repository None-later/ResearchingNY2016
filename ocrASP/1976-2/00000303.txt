"Attic-us? ~

‘ HerodesAtticus. l0l-l77 A.D.,
was a native of Marathon in Attlca.
‘where he owned extensive estates.
His family had been distinguished
and wealthy for several generations.
His father had added to the family's
fortunes when he found a buried
treasure on his property. Herodes
Atticus was a Sophist. Unlike the
Sophists of the ﬁfth century B.C..
who may be ‘regarded as
philosophers. the Sophists of the
second century AD. were teachers
and practitioners of rhetoric.
Although they often engaged in
professional quarrels one with
another they made a signiﬁcant
v'contribu'tion to the Greek revival of
their times. They tended to combine
literary prominence, economic
wealth, and political ofﬁce. The
career of Herodes Atticus is a perfect
example.

Herodes Atticus was a successful
rhetorician who lectured in the
Agrippeum, a public building in the
Athenian Agora. He had many
students. many Ends. and many

Marcus Aurelius. When Avldius
Culius. governor of Syria, rebelled
against Marcus Aurelius, Herodes
Attieus sent him a letter which read
simply: “Herods to Cassius: You
have gone mad."

Herodes Atticusf: muniiicence
toward 7 several Grepk eitksi‘ and
sanctuaries rivaled that of the
emperors. Athens, not surprisingly,
benefited especially from his
generosity. The Panathenaic
Stadium of Athens was provided
with marble seating at his expense.
(The modern stadium on the same
site is a faithful reproduction of the
ancient one and accomodated the
first modern Olympic Games.)
Around I60 A.D. he had thetheater
below the Acropolis built to honor
the memory of his recently deceased
wife Regilla. This theater has a
capacity of more than 5.000. its
facade stands three stories high. and
its most unusual feature was a roof
constructed of expensive cedar
wood. Plays and concerts are now
performed there every summer.

At Delphi our rich benefactor was
responsible for improvements to the
stadium. 'At Corinth he embellished
the fountain of Pirene. He
contemplated digging. a canal
through the Isthmus of Corinth but,
like Nero before him, had to
abandon the plan. (The idea was not
realized until ISM-1893.)
