News ltem:Don‘t Fence Me Out? it seems that a lot of you people ottt there
(I won't mention any names) are disregarding the green control fence that
surrounds the football stadium and are hopping over it. Now that‘s not very
nicel! Seriously. the people that hop over it are making depressions in the
tracksurface that could be dangerous to any kind of runner who is using the
track for another purpose: to run on it. I've been told to tell you to please
walk aroundthe fence from now on. (How ya gonna get S-Quad down there
when you get your pants stuck on the downslide‘?).
