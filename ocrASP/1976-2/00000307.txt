Cautiously Optimistic" F...  .’ 

.5 cries-nu V
To Albany head football coach

‘ ,. Robert Ford, winning football

is not onlya goal. it is a tradi-

L .iion. “I‘m cautiously optimistic,” he

explains of the upcoming football
lesion. Ford has compiled a
remarkable 29-4-1 record in his six-

' tenure as Albany State football
coach and credits a lot of it to his
players. “They always felt they were
goingto win,” he says. And this year?

The scrimmages have already

it. At Monday‘s ﬁrst scrimmage
noises than I32 candidates were pre-
sent and working hard. “We got a
chance to look at everybody." But
today‘s scrimmage at RP] will be
different. Ford will bring over only
60 players so he can look “at the guys
who'll probably play inthe Southern
Connecticut game [the season
opener].

"We have a good nucleus,“ Ford
continues, “but we were exceptional-
ly hard hit by graduation. We lost
twelve seniors." Among the offen-
sive missing are: quarterback John
Bertuizi, center Andy Lee, tackle Ty
Curran. split end Bob Baxter, utility
back Roy Phillbrook, guard Bruce
Court. lineman Bob Paeglow, and
kicker Al Martin.

“Defensively, we lost one of the

‘Vmost outstanding tackles I've ever
coached in Frank Villanova." Jim

Holloway (trickle). Arnie Will
(corncrback), and Ken Schocn
(linebacker) till grad uated. Skip

“Scurry, the leading prissinterccptcr

the past two years, will not be retur-
ning ducto family problems and cor-

—,nerback Andy Mutroni is out

because of injuries. “Almost every

:. spot can be filled by quality

ballpiiiycrs except for defensive
tackle. We have no tried veteran at
that spot and it is wide open.“

With the loss of Bertuzzi. there are
three prime candidates for the star-
'ling quarterback slot. Ford admits
that senior Dave Ahonen (who has

é .

etball team made a hint

seen limited action in past years) has
the inside track but points out that
he is being challenged. Sophomores
Fred Brewington and Brad Aldrich
are both “excellent passers" and
well-skilled. according to the coach.

“We‘ll be using the wishbone
offense againthis year and we‘ll hang
our hats on our running attack.“
Senior fullback Tom Deblois “looks
tremendous" according to Ford and
halfbacks Orin Grifﬁn and Glenn
Sowalskie “look like they're readyto
go.” Deblois is expected to carry
most ofthe inside running game load
while Sowalskie and Griffin are ex-
pected to get the outside attack off
the ground in addition to handling a
good deal of blocking chores as well.
“if you can get your running game
going then you can win on the pass."
explains Ford.

As for the offensive line, “Our
tight end situation has improved
greatly since last year. Tom Cleary is
the leading candidate at that slot.
He's a real solid athlete Willi good
quickness and good hands." The
split end situation is pretty much up
in the air. “We‘lljust have to wait till
we play R P] to get a better idea."

0n the offensive line. Steve Berndt
and Jim Nitschkc will hilllil.‘ it out
for the starting center position.
“Both worked extremely hard dur-
ing the winter program to increase
their strength and spccd." John
Russell and Bob Sheuchcnko will
probably start at the two guard posts
and Dom Ronconc will hold down
one of the trickle slots. The remain-
ing ifleiL’ hcrlh is. according to
Ford, “up in lhc air."

"offensively. ll grout dcul depends
on lhc split cud Situation. the ol'l‘cn-
sivc linc maintaining consistency.
and the quairlcrbiick's ability to
move the offense." concluded the
couch.

On defense. senior John Adlimson
and junior Marty Thompson will
return to their defensive end slots.
Both have been labeled “very consis-

orlc trip to Poland over

tent football players” by their coach.
But as much as the end position is
solid, the tackle area is weak. “We
have three returning ‘veterans' with
no game time experience yet and
eight freshmen battling it out.“ says
Ford. “Of them we have to choose
two starters and two substitutes."

At linebacker. Gerry Bennett and
Brad Kehlenbeck seem to have the
inside track on thejob but they are
“being pressed by three sophomores
and a couple of freshmen.“ accor-
ding io Ford. “i think we can win
with the people we have there.“ The
corncrback positions are “very com-
petitive. We‘ve got a lot of real good
football players there.“ Harry Mc-
Donough will probably return to ﬁll
one of the slots while Bill Allison is
homing in on the other.

in the secondary. Ray Gay will
man the safety slot which became
available with the loss of Scurry.
Gay impressed Ford tremendously
on Monday with two pass inlercep
lions rind all-around hustle. At
defensive halfback, sophomore Bill

Ziemannsppears to have a slight
edge over the other contenders at
this point. “We had Bill at corner-
back but he wanted to trythe defen-
sive secondary and 'we were im-
pressed with him; he‘s a good, hard,
football player."

Junior Mike Rhett and‘soph Fred
Berryhill should also provide secon-
dary depth. The kicking game
without Al Martin is “up in the air”
(pun intended).

The nine-game schedule “is going
to be difﬁcult.“ Ford asserts. “We
open up with a Division II team
(Albany is in the NCAA’s Division
III) that playedspring football. They
had 18 practice days and that's a
helluva advantage.” The Great
Danes also close out their schedule
against a Division ll school
(Springﬁeld).

“Our second game." continues
Ford. "is against lthaca. They
won the Lambert Bowl for Division
III schools the last two years and
have gone undefeated both years.
They were second in the nation both

times and lost in the ﬁnal round}, '

And so the schedule will be tough
this year. But that is due mainly to '
the tremendous growth of the
Albany State football program. “In
our first four or five years here,” ex- '
plains Ford, “we bad quality players
who could step in to fill positions
that were lacking. But now we're
starting to lose some really good,
athletes and we're ﬁnding it harder
to replace them.

“This freshman class is the best we
ever had in terms of quantity and
quality. When Bertuzgi came in here
(as a freshman in I972) he started at
quarterback. in fact, those two
classes “976-77) came in as better
athletes then the kids we had here at
the time.'We recuited them as a
class."

Another Season At Hand

And so another class is history.
And the present one is near-history.
But the seasons go on. And for Ford

- and Co. another season is at band;

another chance to be “cautiously op-
timistic."

The football team Is on the ball early this year. Today they scrimmage R.P.l. and push up most
Saturday against Southern Connecticut at University Field.

Albany Hoop: The Polish Trip

by Mike l’iekarski

The Albany State varsity brisket-
bull team played a few new teams
this summer: Rosolviu, Legiﬂ. Skrii,
Silll‘l. and A51. No. the names aren‘t
in code. It‘s just that the hometown
ctigcrs made it slightly longer road
trip than usual . . . to Poland.

II was all pliri of the basketball
team‘s "goodwill" trip to further in-
ternational cooperation (while play-
ing basketball against non-
Amcricun competition). The trip
was in the planning stages for about
a your before Student Association
and \urious basketball player fund-
raising activities had come up with
enough money to offset expenses.

“We lcft from New York on tin IL-
62 Russiunjct number ()06 and came
back on flight 007," explained
Albany hciid couch Richiird Suuers.
“We left on May 25th and arrived in
Wurwaw about 9 am. too bigrccep-
tion." Unfortunately. it took two
hours for the ten players and two
couches to get through customs, and
two more hours to get to their hotel.
And when they got there, they learn-
ed lluit their day had already been
planned for visitation rites. They
didn‘t get much sleep that day.

“After that day ofl‘ we had three
days in ii row of basketball against
various Polish tctims.“ explained the
couch. Two more off days followed
before they embarked ontheir streak
of five gumesinfivc days. “It wuslikc
playing in the NBA," said Sauers.

“We had to commute 35 or 40
kilometers some days. There was a
lot of travelling."

The Danes played a total of eight
games against six different teams
and ended up with a .500 mark: four
wins and four losses. “The Polish
teams were actually sports clubs,"
explained Suucrs. “There were other
clubs for truck. soccer, and othere
sports. You see. there are different
levels of leagues there. All the teams
we played were League I.

“Every one of the teams had at
least one big guy; 6'7“. Git". 6‘9“.
6' l0" .. .und they were very physical.
We had trouble at first adapting to
international rules and the of-
ficiating was poor, i thought.
Basically, everybody on our team
played the some amount of time and
we were just getting stronger as the
gumcs went on."

Most of the games were played
about 5:30iuthe evening. which only
meant that the players did their
visiting during the day. “Rest was a
problem." conceded Suuers. There
was also an age difference. “All the
guys on the Polish teams were at
least 2|. and I‘d say theyuveragcd 25
yours of age."

“They [the Poles] did shoot well.
and they were good at starting fast
breaks and rebounding. but i don't
think they're individually good
defensive players," commented the
coach. "But they’d hold their own
against our Division ll-Division Ill

teams."

But how did the Albany cagers
fare in the culinary department? Not
that well! Most ate at the hotel, while
some ate their meals utthe American
Embassy in order to get food they
were more accustomed to. For in-
stance. a Polish breakfast typically
included kielbaso, cold cuts, pickles,
rye bread. butter, and tea. For
dinner, a bowl of chicken. potato, or
beet soup preceded the meal which
usually consisted of some type of
meat such as veal or cube steak.
potatoes. cucumber salad. rye bread.
and butter. Supper usually included
cold cuts. cheese, and tea.

Vodka was usually offered. but
most of the players stuck to beer.
Saucrs explained that “the custom
there is that when you open a bottle
of vodka, you finish it."

ice cream and Coke are big in
Poland. Especially the former.
"There'd be lines 60 or 70 people
long on days when it was warm,"
said Suuers. “People religiously wait
on lines. They never butt in front of
anybody." (Hear that. you impatient
college kids!)

Treated Like Stars

According to Gary Trevett. a
senior backcourt man this fall, the
players were treated like stars. “After
it game we'd have 20 to 30 people
waiting for autographs or wanting to
buy our sneakers. I could have sold
{mine for about 890.”
