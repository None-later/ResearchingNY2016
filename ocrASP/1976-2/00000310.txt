3|. Ptesldent Emmett Fields and

administrative iceders‘ to devise' ’ e'

[Ian to divide the Colic; of Arts
and Sciences into three independent
entities.

According'to Neil Brown, deals of
student affairs, the plan is still in the
formative stages. but dates like 0c-
tober l and November l have been
mentioned. .

Presently, three divisions exist in
the College of Arts and Sciences——
Fine Arts and Humanities. Social
and Behavioral Sciences, and
Science and Mathematics.

According to Brown. Fields has
called for the divisions to be elevated
to college status.

Fields and Brown both agreed
that the purpose of the proposal was
to eliminate an academic unit of
SUNYA that is too large to be run

 
   
 
 
 

   

 
 

departments.”

Brown said the change would “do
away with the artificiality of the

College of Arts and Sciences."

According to Fields. the possibili-
ty of this structural change had been
discussed for at least a year at faculty
meetings and among administrators.

When asked if the new colleges
would generate any curriculum
changes, Brown said. “that's really in
the future; but I wouldn't rule it out."

Fields said that if the proposal is
passed, two of the three present
deans of the divisions in the College
of Arts and Sciences would keep

their posts in the colleges.

Legislator Finds Speedy J usti‘cvie,

H. Muskopf, who alsorevoked Hor-
ton’s driver's license and ﬁned him
$200 after he pleaded guilty to driv-
ing while intoxicated and speeding
July l8, has a reputation for jailing
drunken drivers. ' 

“Before Mike. as Muskopf is
known. took office, there were some
roads in this town you could hardly
cross safely. Now most drivers
observe the speed limits.“ a town
resident said.

Propelled by his decisions.
Muskopf said he had not slept a
night since jailing Horton.

He said Horton. who was chased
six miles by State Police at speeds of
up to l05 miles an hour. told him
before sentencing that he, Horton.
had not slept in night since his arrest.

"Neither have I." the justice
replied.

The 48-year-old townjustice. also
a Republican, said he‘d “been think-
ing about it [the sentence] for four
weeks. That sentence was not decid-
ed in haste.“

Muskopf. a native of Buffalo. said
he did. "what I felt was right.“

He added that Hanan. who has
served l4 years in Congress and is
seeking re-clcction this year. would
probably be freed on Tuesday. with

time off for good behavior. '
