AM STEREO-

Now that stereophonic sound is
common on many EM. radio
stations, there's a push to adapt
AM. radio to stereo sounds.

According to Cnhbox, six
different companies are planning to
market stereo systems for A.M.
radio, and one of them has already
petitioned the Federal Com-
munications Conimission with a re-
quest for AM. stereo standards.

The problem now, according to
engineers, is whether current equip-
ment can beadapted or whether con-
sumers would have to buy new
equipment.

you will probably live a long life.

distinct characteristics among those

‘ important one, hesays. isthat people

share their distress with others. “In
other words," says the professor,
“complain.”

Brantner says that letting out
stressful feelings, or complaining,
“Relieves us of some of the burden,”
because we learn more about suffer-
ing when we compare it with others.

HEMOCLIPS

Medical schools and hospitals
around America are reportedly run-
ning out of hemostats.

Hemostats are those scissors——

like clamp instruments that are used'

in operating rooms. The publication
National Orr-Campus Report says
that thousands of hemostats are be-
ing ripped off weekly because they

make excellent roach clips for smok-
ing pot cigarettes down to the very
last speck. .

A medical supply ﬁrm reports that
the problem of disappearing
hemostats is plaguing hospitals
nationwide, and that the replace-
ment rate for the instruments is the
highest of all medical items.

COP CODES ‘

A study of police communications
systems has found that these codes
used by cops such as “to-4” or “IO-
98" are not nearly as efﬁcient as is
plain, old-fashioned English.
