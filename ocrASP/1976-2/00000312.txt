“Isn‘t he something? What‘s his

“Are you for Bella?" the mother

Workers from various campaigns
were there with buttons and
literature. But it was a nice day and
people were more interested in
drinking beer. watching their kids
play carnival games for stuffed
donkeys. and eating the food for
which they paid 59.

After eating four or five clams
they did manage to look up and
listen to some election spiels which
speakers were wise to keep short.

day was Labor Day. spoke of

Clark was slightly upstaged bythe
arrival of the Bella bus. As Krupsak
stepped foward to say a few words
she introduced the voluntary driver
of the busload of Abzug supporters.
Krupsak said that he had donated
his services in appreciation of what
Bella had done for transit worker.

“Right on Mary Ann!” cheered
the crowd as Krupsak spoke of the
present democratic administration's
struggle to get New York State back
on its feet.

BERN. Switzerland (AP) Loud
came the startling noise in the night:
Clip—clop. clip-clop. clip-clap.

Residents of the Liechtenstein
hamlet of lradug awakened to the
sound of horses and discovered they
had been invaded by steelhelmeted
foreign troops.

The villagers suggested that the 75
Swiss militiamen and their 50 horses
were in the wrong country. They

then offered the troops some refresh- .

ment.

But the embarrassed soldiers
made a sharp U-turn behind their
mounted lieutenant and marched
back to Swiss territory.

The Swiss Defense Ministry said
Tuesday it had asked the tiny prin-
cipality for “understanding” about
the indicent which occurred just
before midnight Thursday.

“It's an area where such things can
happen." said a Swiss spokesman.
“Unlike certain other countries. we
are not separated from our
neighbors by barbed wire fences or
border gates.”

Officials said the infantry-support
unit had taken a wrong path at a

region. They marched about l,600

Though Liechtenstein is a
sovereign state. a customs and

the principality‘s foreign relations.

The incident was not expected to
cause any crisis between the two
countries. Their relations survived a
