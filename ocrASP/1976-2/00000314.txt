__ D Vs. CARTER
, President Ford will be the last Republican
President unless his party learns from the first
Republican: Piesident, Abraham Lincoln,
who won on the basis of a broadly-based and
carefully-balanced program . . . His party . . .
has not studied, as Mr. Caner has, the social
and political evolution of the country, or if it
has it has not ‘cared.

' —The Times: London, England

Gerald Ford. . . has to be president again. . .
America can make its choice with a safety net.
but really the pace and interest of the next
three months will center on one man: Jimmy
Caner.

The Guardian; Manchester. England

There is no great policy divide between Mr.
Carter and the President, and no single iss ue—
like Vietnam in l968—to divide the country. .
. President Ford may hope to rely on his own
experience in office and Mr. Carter‘s lack of it.
This presumably is why he has called for face-
to-face TV debates—a ‘ surprising initiative
from the incumbent Prestdent.

—Tlie Financial Times; London, England

It is. of course. improper and imprudent to
take it for granted at this time that Carter will
be the next US. President . . . lncumbency is
known to be a powerful election instrument ..
. Yet Ford goes into the battle the underdog.
His personality may be partly responsible . . .
but the basic reason . . . is the fact that the
Republican Partylacks a broad base .. .in the
extremely diversiﬁed American society.

—Mainichi Shimbun.‘ Tokyo, Japan

 

For the moment the Republican candidate
doesn't stand a chance against his Democratic
opponent . . . Up to now Ford has been par-
ticularly maladroit in reapingthe benefit of his
successes. . ,[which] are numerous. notably in
the economic realm . . . Mr. Ford's horizon
seems singularly limited . . . but the darling of
Grand Rapids has not lost hope.

—L‘Aurore,- Paris, France

Compared with the open but far from
brilliant style of Mr. Ford, Mr. Carter remains
a mysterious personality hiding histrue inten-
tions behind his eternal smile and generous
promises . . . The campaign will make it possi-
ble. under the stimulus of Mr. Dole's rough
barbs and Mr. Ford‘s gentler criticisms, to get
better acquainted with the unknown man
from Plains.

—l.e Mantle; Paris. France

Gerald Ford calmed America after
Watergate. Under him inflation has been cut
in half. no American soldiers are fighting
anywhere. and the ceonomyis holdingsteady.
. . But Ford does not riidititestrength. His style
is wooden. Hc calms but he does not inspire.
—Jan lit'i'letihcrg, Frankfurter Allgemeine

Zeilung:
Frankfurt. Germany

“'l‘hank goodness the Republicans chose
Gerald Ford and not Ronald Regan . . . The
unlikely prospect of a. . . cowboy movie actor
with a simplistic six-gun mentality. . . nearthc
American nuclear deterrent was frightening.

— The Age. Melbourne, Australia

 
 

 

Some parts'of the Republican platform are A

realistic but it also cousins postulates
borrowed from the Cold War arsenal . . .

There are no proposals to deal- with the"

economic and social crisis . . . The main goal is
to curb inﬂation. This is to bedone by tedtlc~
ing the amount spent onthe social needs of the
masses.

—Pravdo; Moscow, U.S.S. R.

The man who seeks'the U.S. presidential
nomination . . . must smile so they can see he
has good teeth . . . raise his hands high so they
can see the length of his arms and the width of
his chest. He must embrace blacks andconsult
with Jews . . . Americans are show-business
people and they like their leaders to agt like
stars on the home screen.

—Al-Ahram, Cairo, Egypt

It would be premature to say that the world
is waiting for Jimmy Caner but . . . insofar as
he promises genuine change and a jettisoning
of discredited modes of thought, an attitude of
helpful interest by the Third World would be
most timely.

—N..l. Nanporia, Financial Express; Bom-
bay/ New Delhi, India

Neither Ford n0r Regan are great men. 0t
this one can be sure . . . Ford is mediocre,
Regan is a demagogue, and Carter is an
enigma.

The tragedy . . . is the plight of the great

black law-abiding majority caught in a terrible

crossﬁre. Their predicament cried out for

compassion. not intolerance.
— The Slar; Johannesburg, SaurhA/rlca'

What is needed [in Southwest Africa] is
elections. difficult as these are to organize. . .
Pretoria‘s only option now is to get the
makeshift new state going fairly quickly. pull
out its forces. and solicit international
recognition for it.

—The Times; London, England

The outside world has a keen interest in the
future of South Africa if only because success
there would improve race relations
everywhere. But . .. it will take more resource,
inventiveness. and conviction than Mr.
Vorster has shown.
