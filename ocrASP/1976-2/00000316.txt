‘ Crosby and Nash Play 011,
Aeoustieally, at Tanglewood

By'KEN KWARTLER

Graham Nash and David Crosby

are best known for their melodic har-
monies andsongs as part of part time
supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash.
and Young. After their 1974 reunion
tour. the two chose to make another
try as a duet (after the original
breakup in l972. they released a joint
album), and produced “Wind on the
Water" a creative but overly electric
album. Their subsequent tour earn-
ed them much notariety as a duo.
They‘vejust released a third album.
"Whistling Down the Wire". and are
winding up a national tour which
brought them to 'l‘anglcwuod on Fri—
day night. There. they overcame the
cold air of the Berkshires and the
cold treatment of local residents in
presenting one ofthc best concerts of
the summer season.

A crowd of several thousand
gathered in 40° weather to hear the
concert. which began in electric
fashion with “Pro-Road Downs“.“l
Used to be King“. and "Take the
Money and Run". It was then that air
oddity occurred. It seems that since
the start of their performance.
'l‘anglewood officials had been
recieving complaints from local
residents that the music was too
lotrd. and by the third song. the

By STEVE SCHULMAN

A troupe of British theater
students. the Mountview Theatre
Company, performed a quartet of
plays in repertory at the Performing
Arts Center last week. The company
performed four diverse plays: Heart-
break House. Oh. What If Lovely

was headed up the road. heavily
armed with threats of lawsuits. in
short order. the sottnd system was
cut off. and an outraged Crosby.
Nash and band stormed offstage to
see what was happening.

According to their soundman. of-
ficials demanded that all electric
mirsie would have to be dispensed
with due to local agreements. After
twenty minutes. a disgruntled
Crosby and Nash returned to tell a
chilled but anxious audience that
they would corrtinire the concert cn-
tirely in an acoustic mode.

Nash siiid.“'l'his is absolutely
crazy. We‘ve never done anything
like this. biit wc'rc goingiogivc you
the best show we‘ve ever done."

Several years ago. ii liitrglcwood
concert by The Who. lire Jefferson
Airplane. and till. King brought so
many local complaints that the Pop-
ular Artists Series was greatly lorrcd
down. Since then. it has generally
been lirriitcd to lolksingcrs. but
nowadays most folksingcrs come
sirpplicd witli electric back-up
bands. and the prohlcnr has arisen
again.

'l he crowd‘s disenchantment was
soon dispelled iis Crosby and Nash
performed their ircotistic.as well as
electric works itr acoustic
arrangements. concentrating on the

magnificent harmonies for which
they are so well known. The high
points of the evening were: “Our
House". Nash's utopian
reminiscence of the Laurel Canyon
house which was home‘ to his
relationship with Joni Mitchell;
Crosby‘s “Guinevere” (“They can't
complain. it's the quietest song I
know. honest“) with a beautifully
interwoven two part harmony;
“Wind on the Water". Nash‘s mov-
ing ballad to the near-extinct whale:
the harmonica solo‘s by Nash on
“Southbound Train". "l’rison Song“
and a newly added arrangement to
“Lady of the Island"; and acoustic
versions of “Low Down Payment"
and especially the Stills-Cros bysong
“Wooden Ships“. which was the best
arrangement of the song since the
original Jefferson Airplane version.

The elcctric music ban proved lit-
tlc problem to the two artists. Being
more at home in “wooden music".
their compositions and harmonies
overshadowed the lack of embellish-
nrcnt. it was tremendously
refreshing to hear their music un-
cluttered by the over-production and
overorchcstration which
predominates in the music of many
folksirigers today. it was indeed. two
artists in purest form. and it was one
of the most memorable perfor-

om Crosby

mances of recent years.

During the evening. the back-up
band did add extra touches to the
music. Craig Doerge's piano work
seems perfectly suited to Crosbyand
Nash's style. Violinist David Lindley
supplied some classic country ﬁddl-
ing. as well as a vibrant backround to
"Wind on the Water". Danny
Kootch. one of the premier studio
musicians of today. improvised on
non-electrified electric guitar by
pointing it microphone at his guitar.
This produced a mandolin-type hue.
He also provided excellent solos on

“A l m 0 st C u t M y
Hair".“Margucrita“ and “Wooden
Ships".

As for the artists themselves.
Crosby's songs were drawn mostly
from his CSNY career. and his rc-
ccnt work with Nash. His
songwriting has improved with each
ofthe recent albums. and the perfor-
mance of songs such as “Carry
Mc“."Naked in the Rain" and fresh-
ly written.“King of the Mountain"
clearly demonstrated this. However.
his individual vocal work was not
nearlyus strong or effective as it once
was. He seemed to concentrate most-
ly on long areas oflow intensity and
short bursts ofcxcitcrrrcnt. especially
on “Long Time Gone“. which vir~

New Exhibitions Planned
By Albany Art Institute

The Albany Institute of History
and Art. located at l25 Washington
Avenue. has initiated several new ex-
hibitions for this full. These include:

The New York Cabinet Maker
and His Use of Space. An exhibition
0f the work of New York State fur-
l‘lllllfc makers from I740 to t840.
Some 65 pieces have been chosen
from The American Wing of the

Metropolitan Museum ol Art. The

tive characteristics of New York

l’hiliidclplritt. lit-ginning with the
late Queen Anne and early Chippen-
dale periods. the exhibition ends

with the Empire style ofthe mid-l9th
century. Sculpture quality. however.
is the primary consideration.
Through October 24.

The William Cullen Bryant
Collection consists of 3| paintings
and 8 works on paper from the
collection of The Century Associa-
tion of New York City. one ofwhose
founders was William Cullen

King and Queen of fairies. Also
worth special mention was Ray-
rnoird Massey. who was a scene-
stcrilcr as Bottom the Weaver. an
Athenian worker with theatrical
pretentions.

l have very few misgivings about
this performance. bearing in mind
that the troupe is not composed of
seasoned veterans. Some of the ac-
tor‘s were overpowered iit times by
the meter of the verse. Pronuncia-
tion was often strained to maintain
the rhymes of couplets where the
works no longer rhyme (for exam-
ple. "eyes" and “qtiulities"). Puck
(Wayne chcsar) was often much
too exuberant. giving him an ar-
tificial quality. My only tnajor com-
plaint was with the fifth act which

between himself and Danny
Kootch’s guitar. His harmonies with

Nash were as magnifier: u ever. -

though (“The Lee Shore” and
“Critical Mass") and were the most
enjoyable part of the evening.

Nash was extremely impressive.
Although his writing had not been
his best on “Wild Tales" or“Wind on
the Water". it has improved on the
new album. and I realized during his
performance how many good songs
he has written. He was able to be
both completely in control during
his solo set. and to hang back and
lend just the right touches to
Crosby‘s vocals. He seemed to total-
ly immerse himself in the music
thoughout the concert. and was
brilliant in his performance.

The evening ended with "Teach
Your Children“. The entire audience
stood on their feet and sang along.
perhaps not so much for the song
itself. but for what it represents:
Crosby. Stills. Nash and Young at
their peak. Al the moment. it is dif-
ficult to predict the future of these
highly unpredictable artists. But for
the present. it is evident that (irahm
Nash rind David Crosby have es-
tablished themselves as exceptional
artists in their own right.

 

deals with a play presented by Bot-
tom rtnd his fellows. The comedy of
the “play within a play" was so broad
that it approached burlesque. the
players often playing directly to the
audience. This is not in keeping with
the high comedy of the play.
