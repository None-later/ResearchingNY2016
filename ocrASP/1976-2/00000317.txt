“Our third meet is our first home
meet (Sept. 25) and we'll be playing
against Army and Syracuse“. Both

Munsey explains. “It's a bigthrillto
have them here."

. The next meet will feature
Colgate. another'Division l college.
Even so, Albany has defeated them
the last two years. Following that
meet is the SUNYAC and Capital

the Albany, Invitational. “We like a
tough schedule but I wish we had a

plainsthe man who has beenequal to
this kind of challenge fora mere
fourteen consecutive seasons. But
this year will surely be just a bit
tougher.

“The goal of this year‘s AMIA

previous ones, is toget the maximum

Texas Instruments will rebate $10.00 of your original

gramming. That’s what pro-
fessionals in your ﬁeld are
doing—right now. And with
an SR-56 you're ready. It
has loo-merged preﬁx pro-

iterate a loop as many times
as you specify. There are 4
levels of subroutine to let
you use your program steps
to maximum advantage.
And, you can even compare
a test register with the dis-
play to make a conditional
branch. So you can check an
intermediate result °
for convergence, or a
maximum.
