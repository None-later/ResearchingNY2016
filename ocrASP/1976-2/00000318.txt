Munsey Worried Over Harriers

by Mlke Plskarskl

“I'm scared to death. We've lost so
many guys and as for our new
arrivals. we haven't seen them in ac-
tion yet.” For Albany cross country
coach Robert Munsey, this kind of
preseason analysis is a new ex-
perience.

Since 1962. when Munsey first
became Albany‘s cross country men-
tor. the team has not had a losing
season. They came closest last year
whentlley finished with a 6-4 dual
Inset record—by virtue of winning

“MWmmmmot-mm

their last fivecontests. With a I4year
overall slate of 126-28. Munsey has
hardly learned what it is to lose here.

But- unless something. or
someone. turns up in a hurry.
Munsey will have his hands full try-
ing to keep his perfect winning
record intact. No less than three of
last year‘s top seven runners are not
returning; including Most Valuable
Runner last year, Carlo Cherubino;
winner of seven of nine races. ‘

Cherubino has graduated but the

other two non-returners have other

reasons. Fred Kitzrow is 'working
and cannot compete this year and
number four runner in I975, Keith
Benman. has declined to come out
because he has decided to work out
on his owu. “I don't know why he
quit.“ said Munsey. “But I guess he
has his reasons".

In any case. his loss will definitely
be felt. “I'm distressed and unhappy
by his decision. He‘s left a tremen-
dous hole and whether or not we can
fill it. I don’t know.“

Nevertheless. Munsey does have a
“fairly solid nucleus“ to work with.
His hopes will probably revolve
around Chris Burns. Brian Davis.
Eric Jackson, Tom Ryan, and Ken
Burnett. Only Burns and Jackson
aretseniors. Burns. incidentally, was
number two behind Cherubino last
year while Davis was ranked third.
(The rankings are computed by
dividing the runncr‘s number of
races entered by the total number of
points he has compiled—Le. three
points for a third finish in a race).

According to Munsey. Jackson
has improved considerably this year.
“He‘s a lot better this year; he‘s got
the conﬁdence. The last meet of the

year he wentvdown tothc ICAAAA .

Meet (in New York City) and came
in 25th out of 202 entrants. The fire!
25 make All-IC4A. He‘s not goingto
be another so-so runner."

This year there are 21 other can-
didates out for the ten cross country
positions and twelve of the hopefuls
are freshmen. “I'm pretty tickled
with it." Munsey asserts. "We also
have a couple of seniors trying out
for the first time."

In addition to the first live, there
are “about five or six people who can
slip on to the varsity." explains the
coach. Junior Mark Dalton is one of
them.

According to Munsey. he‘s “as
strong as an ox. He had a good spr-

» lng season and just didla superjob.
He has an excellent chance to make
the team." Mark Lavan is another

ponent scores first.

“Only eleven guys play. but those
who don't are part of a winning
team. and if someone gets hurt. a
position will open up for a capable
player. The team has balance and

depth. as well as a good attitude. and
we're looking forward to a good
season.“ concluded Schieffelin.

whose prospects look good. “He was
our swing man last year between the
varsity and junior varsity and then
we moved him upto the varsity inthe
middle of the season. He's been run-
ning all summer anf he's got a pretty
good shot at the varsity."

Senior Phil Sullivan is also on the
“possible” list. “He ran track last
year. He's been a little overweight
the last few (track) seasons but he‘s
got a shot at it."

“Leading the pack of newcomers
is a freshman. Matt Williams." says
Munsey. Williams comes from
Highscnville. a town near Wap<
pingch Falls. and Munsey has had
his eye on him fora while. To make a

long store short. according to
Munsey: "he's here and boy am I
happy!“

Tradiitonally. the cross country
team has a preseason race around
Perimeter Road early in the practice
week. and Williams won it this year.
It was “a humid day and the times
were really awf ul." said Munsey. But
he does not take it away from
Williams and his hopes on the
freshman remain high.

Other notable candidates include
senior Roger Miller and freshman
Joe Reinhtirt. “It's strange. two
freshmen and a senior." mused the
coach.

Women Athletes: Come Out

by Christine Ilellinl

Where are you Billie Jean King'll
thought I saw you out there on the
courts hitting a few yesterday. I was
really looking for you. I thought sur-
ely you‘d be trying out for the team
this year. We could sure use you.

You see, here at Albany State we
don't have too many like you. [guess
they may exist. but we seldom see
them. the coaches and us. And it‘s
not because of the competition. We

. play the best in the area. The
program is well equipped with a
. complete coaching staff and new
equipment; all we're missing is you.
And other women like you.

Tennis isn‘t half as bad as softball.
though. We almOst didn't have a
team last year. There just weren't
enough of us to keep the ball rolling
throughout the whole season. Did
you have too many classes to go to
instead of practice? What is it'l?
We‘re really not looking for a Bertha
'l'ickey to pitch for us. I'm sure any
one of you would be a help.

Gymnastics and track and field
suffered a different plight. They had

complete rosters and did a goodjob
competing but something was miss-
ing. It‘s a shame to perform in an
empty gymnasium. It‘s a hollow feel-
ing when no one takes the time to
watch you win the hurdling events.
You really don‘t have to be Nadia
Comeneci to sit on the bleachers and
give a little support.

It's the same old story and faces
from one season to the next for us.
Tennis turns to basketball and swim-
ming and diving. Volleyball waits in
the wings. Gymnastics turns totrack
and field and softball. finishing our
athletic calendar for one more year.

We're really not looking for the
"Babe" at all. Just some interested
souls will do. I guess we‘ll survive
without you once again this year.
We've done so in the past. We still
get by with some good seasons and
some bad. Most of us are good
athletes. others are good sports.

But there are more of you out
there uninterested. too busy. or in-
different. Let this be an openinvita-
tion from the few of us to all of you.
No R.S.V.P.‘s accepted.

Library Extends Hours
With Temporary Funds

by Judy Loeb -

The Library will restore on Mon-
day cight out ofthetwenty operating
hours which had been out due to a
state budget hiring freeze.

According to SUNYA Acting Ex-
ective Vice President David Martin.
temporary service money will be
used to ﬁll two professional library
positions. and to hire temporary stu-
dent supervisors f or the hours that
were cut back.

Martin said. however. that this
was merely “a temporary measure
conducted to combat the statewide
budget crunch we arecxperiencing.“

The remainder of the cut hours
will only be restored. according to
Martin. ifthe Division ofBudgetap-
proves the unfreezing of those va-
cant positions causing the present
cutback in hours.

Should the request to fill the
vacancies be refused Library Direc-
tor James Schmidt said thcrc would
not be enough money to maintain
the newly restored hours for the rest
of the term. He said. “Should this
happen. there is not a shadow of
doubt in my mind that hours would
be cut f urther."

According to Schmidt. the
Library will increase its operating
hours from its present 83.5 hours per
week. to 91.5 hours a week starting
on Monday.

The new hours will be: Monday
through Thursday from 7:30am. to
midnight. Friday from 7:30 rim. to
6:p.m.. Saturday from lO:a.m. to
5:00 pm. and Sunday from l:00 pm.
to 9:p.m. .

Schmidt emphasised the fact.
however. that hiring student help
will not hold out for the rest of the
semester if SUNY Central does not
act onthis matter. Hcsaid.“ltisonly
on a temporary basis.“

A “study-in" was planned by Stu-
dent Association President Steve
DiMeo if improvements don‘t occur
within a week.

DiMeo remains disatisfied with
the proposed temporary increase.
because he feels it is still not ade-
quate to meet the student's needs. He
sees the issue as still being unresolv-
ed. and plans to take action on the

matter. unless immediate changes
occur.

DiMeo said. “The matter is
urgent. and I won't tolerate the situa-
tion." He sees that in order to main‘
tain the academic excellence that this
school requires. the library must
resume its original schedule of l03.5
hours a week.

Action Next Week

Action by the Division of Budget
could take place within the next
week. Otherwise. the “study-in" to
protest the cut hours will come off as
planned.

 

Aims sw‘vYA Toward mu..- Palicy.Anoly

by Stephen Delilah V

SUNYA is headed for a new era of

increased public policy analyiis‘ ac-
cording to a proposed mission state-
ment released by President Emmett
II. Fields at a press conference
Wednesday morning.

Fields described the mission state-
ment, or statement of purpose. as a
response to the SUNY Master Plan
released this summer by Chancellor
Ernest Boyer. The plan requires that
each campus prepare a clear mission
statement flavored by SUNY‘s new
push on public service.

"Apparently. one of the themes in
the mission statement. as you will
discover in reading it," said Fields
standing before a cluster of
microphones in his office. “is a
reemphasis on the uses this campus
can be put to in public policy
analysis and servicing state and local
government." 1

Swift faculty response to the mis-
sion statement came at a prearrang-
ed press conference called hy the
Committee of Concerned Faculty in
a Campus Center lounge. A written
release being circulated by the com-
mittee accused Fields of attempting
to create a “Think Tank" at
SUNYA. Committee members
described the concept of a think
tank as an institution serving the
needs of public policy making rather

than education.

Committee spokesman Donald
Reeb. an associate professor of
economics at SUNYA. explained
that public policy analysis at the un-
iversity is normally conducted on an
individual basis. Members of the

faculty seek out an area of concern
trying to find a piece of research that
is academically respectable and
acceptable to the particular govern-
ment agency.

“But a think tank," said Reeb. “is
a much different kind of
phenomenon, especially if you con-
nect it with the university. What
you‘re doing is asking a university
not to take on an educational func-
tion. . .but rather to serve the
primary purpose of coming up with
sellable ideas for politicians for their
constituencies. That's no longer a
university. I’m not too sure what it
does to a university because I know
of no university that ever did it."

Fields rejected the contention that
SUNYA might evolve into a think
tank. “Think tanks." said Fields.
"have scholars that are working
wholly on their scholarship without
any obligation to teach and that ob-
viously does not describe us."

The mission statement earmarks
the following departments and
schools for a net increase in faculty
lines and associated support funds as
soon as is feasible: Business. Com-
puter Science. Economics. Psy-
chology. Public Administration.
Rhetoric and Communications.
Social Welfare, and Sociology; r

The statement calls for continued
support of the following programs
based on their quality. achievement.
and potential: Anthropology. At-
mospheric Science. Biology.
Chemistry. Criminal Justice.
Educational Psychology. Geology.
German. Mathematics. Philosophy.
Physics. Public Administration. and

l
clear that the move toward 
involvement in matters of‘Epublic
policy can take a variety offforms
and include a wide rang of fields
and disciplines.’However.tb'e state‘-
ment singles out the following
programs to be given special en-
couragement in helping  York
State solve some of its problems: At-
mospheric Science. Business. Com-
puter Science. Criminal Justice.
Economics, Educational "Policies.
Programs and Institutions.
Educational Psychology.
Geography. Geology. Political
Science. Psychology. Public ‘Ad-
ministration. Social Welfare. and
Sociology“ ‘

Fields stressed that the proposed
mission statement is" only a
university-level document. not a
finalized scheme of SUNYA's
future. “The missionstudyhasbeen
designed." said Fields. “so that we
open it up to everyone on the cam-
pus for their thoughtful reﬂection
and criticism. whether friendly to the
general crux of the document or un-
friendlyto it. . .Members of the un-
iversity will have full opportunity to -
react to the statement and to par-
ticipate in the preparation of the
final mission plan for esch'schooi
and department at the-university."

Fields expects that a revision of
the mission statement will take place
sometime in November.

A certain amount of flexibility is
built into the mission statement to
compensate for unforeseen chanps

Jack Ford Speaks At The Hyatt House

It was Jack Ford‘s first stop in a

Members of the New York
Republican State Committee got a

President‘s son at a

autographs for their kids at home.
He said he felt comfortable because.
“There is a common goal here. This is
the core. what determines if we win
or lose.“ He thinks his father has a
good chance of carrying New York
State.

Although he is giving his all to the
campaign. Jack said that no two
people can agree on everything and
that he does disagree with his father‘s
stand on abortion. strip mining. and
the decriminalization of marijuana.

“There are some things which I
think should be decided on a private
level” said Jack on the question of
abortion legislation.

In a crowd where some men were
wearing elephant-design ties and
ladies were selling "Elect Betty
Ford's Husband For President" but-
tons. it wasclear Jack wasn't there to
win direct votes. He was there to in-
spire committment; to get
Republican campaign workers to
give their all. He shook hands with
almost all of the 200 committee
members present.

After everybody had eaten their
last spoonful of sherbert and listened
to introductions by New York
Repubtiesn Committee Chairman
Richard Rosenbautn. and Majority
leader of the New York State
Senate Warren Anderson. Jack ad-
dressed the crowd.

 

Humble in his approach. calling
himself a “rookie” he talked about
Carter's playing both sides of the
issue and Republican responsibility.

“We have two candidates. One
who says what he means and
promises what he can produce. And
we have a candidate on the other side
who is willingto promise anythingto
anyone; willing to say to any
audience what they want to hear and
not what is good for this country.
And I tltink that's the kind of
difference we have to accent and
offer to the American people.

“As Republicans. we are more
conscious and much more aware of
these kinds of stands. we‘have a
responsibility in the community and
on the local level to take exactly
these kinds of stands and differences
