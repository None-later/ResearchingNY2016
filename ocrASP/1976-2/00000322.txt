Linu Wertmuller. didn't happen
overnight. This phenomenal female
director comes to us via a Iongtradi-
tion in Italian ﬁlmmaking. and much
of her material and her vision is
founded on the work of other master
directors. Before comment on this
woman‘s Iilmic contribution. a short
historical survey of Italy‘s movie
making will be ofconsiderable help.

It was only after the Second
World War that the Italian cinema
began to show great promise. This
was the era of Vittorio De Sica,
Roberto Rosscllini and Luchino

Visconti. Their gift to the art of the
motion picture lay in their formation
of a group of films created under the
banner of Neo—Reulism. Films like
Chromium), Open City and Bicycle
Thieves marked the beginning of a
new way of making cinema: of
visually relating it director‘s passions
and thoughts. Lavish studio
procedure was replaced by real loca-
tion shooting using local people as
well are professional actors (borrow-
cd from the Soviet director Eisens- ,
tcin). Their films conveyed a power-
ful and direct sense of responsibility
to the plight of ordinary people op-

presses by both merit] and political
events. Their themes were simple but
their conviction to present The
Reality was immediate and tough.

To meet the demands of this new
realistic subject matter. these direc-
tors imposed a new method of
technique, the unobtrusive camera;
complete with long takes. little
movement and natural com-
positions. In short. little or no for-
mal experimentation. As with much
of the free flowing style of a Jean
chior. these ﬁlm‘s importance lie in
their immediate and direct con-
veyence of their message to an
audience.

The Nco-Realist cry for im-
mediacy, simplicity and directness
was challencged in the middle ﬁfties
by a second group of film makers.
the most gifted including Federico
Fellini and Michangelo Antonioni.
Fellini. who began as a new-realist
(co-directing for Rossellini) quickly
grew weary of the adherence to the
strict untouched environment and
ventured into poetic
autobiographical subject mutter.
Antonioni. from the very start of his
career. concerned himself with
elements untouched by the neo-
reaIists: mystery. eroticism. and in-
dividual alienation. Now there
emerged the director‘s personal in-
sights. his own neurosis and above

it was welcomed. If they were con-
fusied. they would haveto try harder.
No longer could they remain passive
observers.

Probably the most important con-
tribution Fellini and Antonioni gave
to the Italian cinema (and cinema
in general) wastheir personal themes
and obsessions. both these directors
have shown equal concern and
dedication for style. especially An-
tonioni. He comes fromthctradition

' a beautiful 'vllual abstraction and
metaphor for the despair he is com-
municating. In Fellini’s celebrated
8'15 camera placement and move-'
ment is so imbued with the shots
thematic significance. that discuss-
ing either one or the other becomes
useless.

Discipline and genius.enable both
Fellini and Antonioni to create un-
doubtedly the most rich and
vigorous work in the history of the
Italain film. All significant film that
is to come from Italy will stem from
these two director's foundations.
And this is where Wertmuller finds
her beginning.

In 1963 Fellini made Lina Wcrt-
muller his assistant director to 81/}
She soon became bored with this
position and quit. only to im-
mediately embark on making a film
about Fellini makingll'ﬁ. That same
year. she made. inexpensively. her
first film. The Lizards. which has
only had a few showings in the Un-
ited States. The film made money
which enabled men to make Let's
'I'alh About Men. which is currently
playing in New York City as a first
run feature.

I saw Ll-I's 77.n- .-thoul Mun this
past weekend. Whoever was respon-
sible for its first run release is taking
everyone for a ride (I paid $410 get
in); l.t‘l'.\‘ Talk zllmul Mm says ub-
solutely nothing and is one of the
most theatrical and static films I
have ever seen.

()nee then preliminary works \\ ere

over with. \Vertmullcr began with
her major works. The Sr'l/lli'lfoll of
Mimi. Low uml Anarchy. All
Screwed Up. SW0,” .4 It'llll'. and most
recently Saw-n Ut‘tlfllft’.\'. I‘heir sub-
ject matter ranges from an Italian
underground partisan trying to kill
the Ducc while hiding out in a
brothel in Low 0an Anarchy. to an
arrogant capitalist mistress and her
mistreated mnnservunt shipwrecked
together in a desert island in Strep!
A way. There is a eharmingexchungc
ol' glances between two soon-to-be
lovers in The Seduction of Mimi.
and the horror and pity of II concen-
tration camp prisoner escaping the
firing squad by leaping into a pile of
real shit in Seven Beau/lea.
Iler messages encompass much:
love. hate. sex. political injustice and
just about anything one might ex~
pool from an Italian soul. There is
both the tragic and the comic. the
profound and the superﬂuous. There
are touches of Fellini here and there,
some obvious. others a little more
subtle. One may even detect a neo-
realist passage. Her characters one
minute may cry. the very next mo-
ment burst into outrageous laughter
In Seven Beauries the balance
between pain and joy is precarioust
thin.
