i. ‘ didn't e'Xpeetto meet him so soon. ‘
 He sat clatter-leg etc-ed. dan-

cing over what appeared to beacopy

jof the New York Times, or perhaps ,
the trect Journal. The gray

 outlined the carpeted ofﬁce. casting

his ﬁgure in a hazy shadow.

The absence of adequate lighting
lent an air of serenitytothc executive
abode and its occupant. Not until
later. in the afternoon. would the ris~
ing sun poke its warm rays in
through the smudged glass panes.

He seemed so harmless. so gentle
sitting there. The mystique and tales
of tyranny built around tltis
character seemed. at the moment.
quite unrealistic.

Suddenly. he cocked his head up
from the paper and noticed me stan-
ding in his outer ofﬁce. alone. When

I saw his silhouette peering out at me

from behindhis eyeglaues, i felt like
I harll'just been apprehended dum-
ping sugar in-some old man’s gas
tank. i had wandered haphazardly
into a place where I dldn‘t_belong.
More embarrassed than? fearful. I
stood speechless before him. Hoping
for a slightly warmer reception than
Sitting Bull gave Custer, I waited.
and I stared. _

“Hello.” he said in a cheerful

voice. .
“How are you?" I replied quickly.
I wanted to say more, btit no words
came. And then. there was un-
bearable silence.

Rising from his chair he turned
away and began shuffling papers
around his desk. I walked out into
the lobby.

Wertmuller

cum. from page 30

Lina Wertmuller has tried very
hard in relating her messages
through the medium ofthe motion
picture. John Simon. in a recent
review of Seven Beaulies. says of
Wertmuller “she is the most impor-
tant film director since Bergman."
Although Simon usually ex-
aggeratcs his praise for any good
narrative. he is partially correct in
his praise. Wertmuller is a total ﬁlm-
maker: she has shown a masterful
awareness of the cinema‘s resources.
As with Fellini and Antonioni.she is
very mttcb interested in the method
of film structure and selection. In
The .S‘ct/ut'liun of Mimi she intercuts
in a wonderfully rythmic measure
focus cxtrcmeclosc-ups of Mimiand
her lover tltus achieveing a kind of
light poctry within a tight tilmic for-
mat. ln Seven Iicuulim' the

photography. the placement of ac«
tors and objects. the editing are all
superb; discipline and a keen eye
show us she is well within a mature
style.

Despite hustcful praise from
hastel'ul feminists. Wertmuller is an
important director. She is leaving
her mark on cinema aesthetics and
not merely 'on leftist female eman-
cipators. Her value as an artist will
be derived ultimately from her
cinematic excellancc and not from
her social. moral\ or sexual
from preferences. Wertmuller is
enjoyed for various reasons; but
she must be appreciated for what she
does best. and that is her use of the
medium. Many of her stories and
messages have already been used.
She is giving them to its through a
different pair of camera eyes. and an
appealing excellent pair at that.

Audio and video technicians arm-
ed ,with the electronic tools of their
trade clamored through the room
and into the President's ofﬁce. I
followed them in and looked about

v the ofﬁce for Fields. He was gone.

‘ 'White hot photographer‘s lights
out through the grayness of the of-
ﬁce, burning away the calm that had
pervaded the place earlier. The
President slipped from amongst the
crowd of reporters and out underthe
shower of light focused onthe corner
of the room. Cameras clicked away
and papers rustled as the President
made his way to the microphones
awaiting him. Then. with a thin stack
of papers in his left hand and 
right hand stuffed in the pants
pocket of his blue suit, he spoke.

He talked about the mission in a
cool. thoughtful manner and ad-
dressed the many questions that
were asked, occasionally allowing a
grin to flash across his face while
responding to some of the less in-
telligent inquiries.

The reporters tried to drill holes in
his mission statement. but he yielded
no ground.

After the lights went out and all of
the reporters had left. I approached
President Fields. There was a brief

introduction and then he invited me
to sit doWn. He seemed relieved that
it was all over. pullinga fresh pack of
Sulems from his suit pocket. He
peeled off the plastic wrapper. folded
back the little triangles of foil and
removed one of the cigarettes from
the pack. We chatted about the
Albany Student Press as he lit the
cigarette and took a long relaxing
draw on it.

As we talked. I thought about the
resistance that he and his mission

would meet in the days tocome. Ris-
ing. we shook hands and agreed to
meet again toittlk about things going
on around campus. Walking away. I
realized that like the “all powerful"
Oz, Fields was far less threatening
than his image.

And I wondered whet her he would
successfully mold SUNYA into a
new shape. whether he would check
to see how many lndians were lying
in wait across the river before he
went off into battle.

produced, many people is try‘
capitalize on the success and pop-

ularity of the southern sound. These ’

people are easily distinguishable

from the originalsouthern hands by .

their attempts to inject a small

amount of each band's‘style' into‘

their own songs.

One such artist is Steve Young.
whose new album,"Renegade
Picker." contains a few good songs,
some fair songs and some badsongs.
all of which lack originality. The
only thing that pulls some of the
songs through is the strong in-
strumental backing of Young‘s
Nashvillesidemen.

The first song. "Renegade
Picker," is memorable only because
of the excellent lead and slide guitar
interplay throughout the song. “I
Can't Be M yself,” "Old Memories"
and "It's no! Supposed to Be That
War” are all slow country songs
dominated by Buddy Emmons‘ fine
steel guitar playing. "Tobacco
Road," a song made famous by
Edgar Winter, is one of the better
songs on the album because of the
outstanding harmonica work of
Terry McMiilttn and Mac (ittydcn‘s
sweet slide fills. The rest ofthe album
follows in this style. with Steve
Young‘s sidctttcn providing the best
elements in each of the songs.

Young deserves credit for tying
the lyrics ofthe songs into a common
idea of himself as a "renegade."
However. his generally weak singing
and songwriting prevent “Renegade
Picker." lront achieving any great
status in a time whencountry-rock is
an otct'crotvtlcd and highly coin-
petitive form of music.

. Of the multitude of women who in
ancient Greece plied the trade of a
hetaira only a few gained fame.
Thais of Athens became the mistress
of Alexander the Great (Classical
Forum April 2. l976). and Luis of
Corinth granted her favors to
Diogenes the Cynic. At least equal

to these two in fame was Phryne.
All three lived in the second half of
the fourth century BC.

l’hryne came to Athens from
'l‘hespiac in Hocotitt. Site was wide-
ly admired for her beauty bill also
considered dangerous—mot an un-
common combintt'tion. A comic poet
likened her to Charyhdis. the
mythical monster that together with
Scylla. ruins ships and men. It is ap-
parent thut she possessed not only
beauty but also intelligence and
pride.

When l’hrync was brought totrizil
on a charge of profanation. her
defense was undertaken by the dis-
tinguished orator Hyperides. When

he felt that he was about to lose the ‘

case and his client about to be con-
dctnncd. he suddenly tore off her
dress. revealing the beauty of her
bosom. l’hryne was promptly ac-
quitted, but the Athenians expressly
forbade that sort of thing in future
cases.

l’ltryne also created qttitc a stir at
the Festival of Poseidon on the
island of Aegina. This festival coit-
cludcd with the (Iphrudllrirl. an occa-
sion to which ltctairui were especially
invited. in tire sight of all the people.

her hair. stepped into the sea, and
reenacted the birth of Aphrodite.
Later she posed for Apelles for his
painting Aphrodite Rising from the
Sea Was Botticelli aware of this
tradition when he painted his
famous Birth of Venus.

The sculptor l’raxiteles fell in love
with Phrynetand she served as the
model for his nude staue of.
Aphrodite (Classical Forum
February l8. I975). He gave to her as
a gift a statue of Eros. which she in
tttrn gave to her native Thespiae. ln
gratitude. the people of ‘l‘hcspitte set
up a gilded stattte of l’hrync at
Delphi. There it slood on a marble
column ’und surrounded by the
statues of kings. No one objected ex-
cept the Cynic pltilospltcr Crates.

Another philosopher whom the
charms ol l’ltrync apparently did not
impress very much was chocratcs.
head of the Academy and a virtuous
man. At a banquet :tttcttdcd by both.
l’hrync did her best to entice
Xcuocrntes. bttt he resolutely
resisted her. although he had had
quite a bit of drink.

After the destruction of 'I'hebes by
Alexander the “full in 335 li.C..
l’hrync reportedly offered to rebuild
the nulls ol the city, provided only
that it plaque should' read:
"Destroyed by Alexander. rebuilt by
l’hryne the hetaira.“ l'he anecdote
probably means no more than that
l’lu'ync had become qttite wealthy.

Not suprisingly. nothing is known
ahottt l’hrync‘s later life and death.
