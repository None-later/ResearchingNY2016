Golf Squad Returning Virtually Intact,

it appears that Albany‘s hopes

Colgate is a Division 1 Squad while
the Danes are Division ill.

Wednesday‘s season opener
against Sicna resulted in an amazing

on the short side. Jeff Silverman got
off to an incredible start by going 4

AMIA: Inside Story

The AMlA (Association of Men's
intramural Athletics) is governed on
the strength ofa newly-revised Con-
stitution that is administered by an
intramural council which meets
every Thursday evening at 6:30 pm.
in CC-370. 'i he AMIA Council
currently has ten members. but will
admit two more in thecomingweeks
and operate for the remainder of the
year at its normal count of twelve
people. (Applications for these
remaining two positions are
available in C0356.)

The Council makesjudgments on
all protests. contrives every policy
change. and institutes all new in-
novations for the organization. The
current Council membership is as
follows: Michael Curwin (Presi-
dent). Len Goldman (Vice-
Presidem). Don Knapp (Secretary).
Bruce Sheingoid (Treasurer). Randy
Egnaczyk (Head Official). Mark
chhsler (Student Assistant

tramural Athletics).

There are three standing com-
mittees' of AMlA Council. The
Minor Sports committee deals with
allactivities withthe exception ofthe
large leagues. These include three—
~on-three basketball. tennis. wall
sports. wrestling. track and field.
superstars. pinball. and tug-of-wur.
just to name a few. The Publicity
committee is in charge of notifying
the student body of all events. which
requires a good deal of manpower.

Finally. there is the Awards com-
mittee which has as its task the
ordering of trophies. T-shirts. and
other suitable awards for the vic-
torious teams and individuals. These
committees can use the help of any
student who wishes to devote some
extra time to the AMlA.

contacted in order to discuss any
AMIA event or provide any service
needed in regard to intramurals here
at Albany. The AMiA Council of-

Two Students Hospitalized
In Campus Center Brawl

by Jon Hodges
and Tom Martelio

Two SUNYA students were
hospitalized as a' result of injuries
sustained in a brawl that erupted in
the Campus Center a week ago
Saturday.

The students are John Veruto.
who received ti totttl ol‘clevenstiches
on his i'acc and head; and Robert
iioissy. who required six stitches for
head injuries.

The incident occurred ap-
proximately 12130 u.m.in the check
cashing area of the Campus Center.
and involved between eight and ten
people. The two students were at-
tnckcd with chairs. garbage cans and
belts. according to eye-witnesses.

“l was going past the pool room
when i heard some noise by the
check cashing window." said John
Campbell. a student who was on
duty at the Campus Center informa-
tion Desk that night. “When i got
there i saw sotnconc heating at kid
with one of those whitc trnshcttns.
There was about six to eight other
guys swinging belts.“

“i ran and called Security who
arrived in about two or three
minutes.“ continued Campbell.
"Most ofthe kids were gone bythcn.

they ntust have found ottt that
Security was on the way.“

According to Vcruto. he and
Boissy were getting something to cut
at the snack bar of the Rnthskcllur
when they were verbally harassed by
four males. After leaving the Rat.
Vcrnto and lioissy confronted the
group again. After another verbal
exchange. a fight broke out between

iloissy and one of the youths.

Shortly after the fight begun.
Verqu claimed that three or four
new uttttckcrs were brought over
from a Campus Center party by one
til the original four. Sotncottc then
hit Vcrulo with a chair while another
attacker heal upon Boissy with a

the university.

“The investigation is presently at a
dead end.“ said Jim Williams of
Security. “The description the boys
haVc given us are a little vague. No
charges have been pressed.“

Both students are members of the
varsity football team.

“No one has ever paid out of his

Altman said Albany Campus
Events overspcnt last year‘s budget
by $8.000 and “so we canned the

unlikely an officer would pay."

“Winn this amendment means."
Altman said. “is the first thing an of-

“it would mean that he doesn‘t take

“l‘vc had a personal. people-

Associate Business Dean, Donald
D. Bourque had this to say about
Farley: “He has been nominated for
the outstanding teacher award at
SUNYA for four consecutive years.
His student ratings are well above
average. in terms of student affec-
tion . . . Farley is above the heap."

Bourque added. “He isn‘t a
