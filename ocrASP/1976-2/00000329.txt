The State Board of Regents has
been accused of holding an unfair
bias against the State University
over New York's private colleges at
hearings held in New York and
Albany on their tentative four year
plan for higher education.

The statewide master plan.
prepared by the staff of Education
Commissioner Ewald B. Nyquist for
the Regents. was made public
August It). Among its long-range
recommendations are:

-Students at public institutions
should pay one-third of the cost of
their education. The Regents claiin
that tuition at SUNY units presently
defray only 2.5 per cent ofeducation
costs per student, a figure contested
by others involved in public higher
education studies.

-Costs at private institutions should
be brought in line with those at

 

public ones though increased state
aid. ' - ' v ‘ '
-There should be a construction

moratorium imposed upon the State

University.

-The Regents should be given review

powers over both SUNY and CUNY

budgets.

A master plan recently adopted by
the State University‘s Board of
Trustees projects an enrollment in-
crease of 25.000 students by I980,
while the Regents‘ plan calls for IS,-
000fcwer students in SUNY by l984.

At the bearing State University
Chancellor Ernest L. Boyer stated
that one of the reasons for the dis-
crepancy between the Trustee‘s and
the Regent‘s enrollment forecasts is
that the Regents base their figures
partly on the assumption that the
high school drop-out rate would
continue to be high.

SUN YA Students Will
Get a Shot in the Arm

by Diane Weniler

The swine flu vaccine will be ltd-
ministcred by tltc Student Health
Service in the campus center by late
October at the earliest. ttceordiitgto
Director of the Student Health Ser-
vice. Dr. Janet Hood.

Swinc flu is ll new strain of in-
fluenza virus that has the Cttpttcity to
reach epidemic proportions. This is
because people have not been ex-
posed to the strain ttnd therefore
have no imtnunity against it.

The vaccines will be given ottt free
of charge to students and faculty on
campus for three consecutive l’ri-
days. There will-be an open time
schedule during the tiin which will
enable people to go ttt their coit-
\ienicnce.

it will be mandatory for the
students and faculty. who want the
vttccittc. to receive it on one ofthosc
3 l‘ridnys. The only spcciul measure
taken will be for the disabled
students. Thcy will be able to get the
vaccine in the infirmttry on any day
convenient to thcm duringthttt three
week period.

Students will be required to fill out
consent forms (which explain possi-
ble results of the vaccine). rclntc tiny
health problem and then receive the
shot. The whole process should not
take too long. according to Hood.

The vaccine is not out yet. it will

end ofSept..says Hood. Two types of
vaccines exist. The bivalent one will
be administered to those over 65 and
to those with it health problem. The
other. monovnlcnt. will be ad-
ministered to those between the ages
of lit through (i5 and who have no
bitsic hcttil h problems. The vaccine is
not rccomtncndcd for people under

because of the reactions that might
occur.

The Vaccine promotes tltc produc-
tion of antibodies. withottt causing
the fill. Thus. no one will get the flu
from taking the vaccine. The virus
used in making the vaccine is grown
in eggs. so people who are highly
allergic to eggs should not take it.

A group of SUNYA students ttrc
attempting to organize ll student tlll-
ion because they feel the Student
Association is not serving the stit-
denl body as effectively as it should
be. particularly iii the area of
academics. The Student Organizing
Project is currently engaged in on cf-
fort to infornt the student popultt-

enrollment projections on artificially
imposed enrollment ceilings which.
restrict opportunity and mask true
demands," he asked rhetorically.

The Chancellor chided the
Regents for accusing the State Un-
iversity of glutting the employment
market with doctoral graduates who
cannot find work “even though
three-quarters of the doctoral
degrees in the state are awarded by
private institutions." ,

Stony Brook President John Toll
assailed the plan for “reinforcing
previous preceptions of some that
the Regents are biased against public
universities". adding that the
Regent‘s proposal would make
SUNY students pay the highest tui-
tion of the major public universities
in the nation.

“In dramatic contrast." Toll said.
“The draft report proposes to more
than double the direct and indirect

‘ more

   
 
 

aid to private institutions of higher
education.",He noted that while the‘
state ranks 38th nationally in aid to
higher education-it is first inamount
of aid to private institutions.

SASU Legislative Director Joel
Packer testified that within SUNY‘s
$643.6 million budget, students
generate 8.3% of the total through
tuition. and not 2.5% as said in the
Regents plan. . -

“If tuition revenues were to rise t
33%." Packer said. “Tuition would
have to rise by more than $1000 per
year to it total of $l850.“

Packer noted that the claim that
increased financial aid would help
offset tuition increases was incorrect
because most income students were
not cligable for aid.

“Under the Federal Basic 0ppor~
tunity Grant Program. individuals
with incomes exceeding 310.000
pnetu do not receive rm. These

 people; if

 

school; would  M00

Packer stated that SASU ound
“no economic or academic me n
the Regents proposal on‘ tuition
levels. and findsit completely incon- 
sistent with your (the Regents) stand"
on open acces.” also disagreeing with
the construction halt proposal say-
ing that it was basedvon “overly
simplistic data’ on facilities ‘utlliza-
tion.” '

Packer joined with others in con-
demning the Regents proposal that
they be granted budgetary review
over SUNY and CUNY. arguing
that it would be inappropriate to
place the Regents in operational
control ofthc public sector, thereby
increasing the bureacracy. upsur-
ping Executive authority while no
such provision exists for the private
schoob.

.loc Dicker. one of the founders of

ed to forth on alternative rcpresctt-

budget cuts.

He said. “Thc administration

to Ricun Studies. ltttlittn Studies.

School of Nursing. I expected the
Student Association to react. but
they did nothing bttt make it fcw fee-
ble complaints.

Dicker claims tltcrc was no stuv
dent imput regarding academic cut-
backs. He said. “The administration

‘

 

ALBANY STUDNT PRESS

neither requested. or was offered stu-
dent opinion regarding the budget
cuts."

Dicker also said that Steve
DiMco. President of the Student
Association. vigorously opposed the
formation of the Student Organizing
Project. Dicker said. “He denied
recognition of the organization.“

Dicker explained that this action
would have made it almost impossi-
blc for the group to operate on cam-
pus. He snid.“Fortunntcly the Cen-
trul Council ignored DiMeo's
rccomntendtttion."

DiMeo admits that the Student
Association had little more than
token representation when the
mechanics of the budget cuts were
worked out. “It was out of our
hands. in fact the administration had
very little to my about it.“ he said.
“the directive to cut L] million
dollars from SUNYA's bttdgct came
from the State Bud get Dc partmcnt.“

When itskcd about his opposition
to SOP DiMeo said he could not br-
ing himself tosupport "somcthingso
absurd and unrealistic." He added
that “it would circumvent the role
SA should be playing. We should
improve the existing system. to form
a counter organization is dcvisive
and impractical."

Dicker claims that his organiza-
tion does not wishto opposethe Stu-
dent Association. "We feel there is a
place for both organizations on cam-
pus; and that both are necessary."
