Steve DiMeo, President of SA,
has spoken to the Capital District '7
Transit Authority to explore the
possibility of rerouting and/or ex-
panding city bus routes to ﬁt the
geographic needs of off-campus
students. 'This would also help to
lower the rents of apartments that
are on the present bus route, and
might influence landlords to ﬁx up
their property to kceptheir tenants.
Landlord abuse is another impor-
tant problem that the OCA, the SA.
and the Office of Residences are con-
cerned with. OCA has plans for

'landlord and tenant education and

seminars.

According to Mike Grill, head of '
OCA. “. . . landlords and students
must work together. It‘s a two way
street."

Seminars that will familiarize
students with consumer tips, and
teach them to do small home repairs:
are also on the agenda for off-F
camp‘ulsstudents. ti

" The of lice of Residences presently;

provides some needed services for'
the off-campus student. They give
information on leases. and help
mediate difficulties between students
and their landlords.

Housing and Student Affairs are
also going to devote time to the
problem of students with children.
Dean of Student Affairs. Neil
Brown. believes that services such as
daycare centers are necessary. and
are being discussed by the university.

The Ofﬁce of Residences, the 0f-
fice of Student Affairs. OCA. and 2'
the SA are veryct'ii‘icerned with the
economic impact that students have
on this community. They agree that
it is necessary to educate the com-
munity as to the beneﬁts it derives
from the student population interms
of increased sales, and the student
work force that the university
provides. Hopefully. this will helpto
better student-community relations.

The university is realizing the ex-
tent of the problems of off-campus
students. Although there will be no
new fund allocations. the-university.
the SA. and the OCA will make
better use of their limited resources
to benefit off-campus students.
