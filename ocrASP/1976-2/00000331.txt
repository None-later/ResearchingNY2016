SICK-MONEY

A new survey of higher learning
has found that a large numberof the
nation‘s colleges are unhealthy—at
least on the money front.

The study, publsihed in the higher
education monthly Change 3,‘-dis-
covered that about half of the more
than 2000 institutions surveyed, are
in poor financial condition.

The survey rated colleges in ﬁve
financial categories, from "Healthy"
to “Unhealthy”. it found. that a
whopping 86 percent of the colleges
polled fell into the bottom two
“Relatively unhealthy" and
"Unhealthy" categories.

 
 

Those institutions which faredthe
best economically were the large
public universities and, believe it or
not, the “Men only" or "Women
only” universities.

-~POT STATS
For the iiist time in more than a
decade. the number of persons
arrested on marijuana charges in the

United States; during a l2-month'

period has declined.

The official FBI arrest statistics
released recently show that 4l6.l00
Americans were arrested on pot
charges during 1975. According to
the FBI. this represents a'seven per
cent decline from the previous year.

The figure of more than 400,000
pot arrests — although down
somewhat from I974 —— still in-
dicates a staggeringincrease over the
18,000 pot arrests recorded in 1966.

Keith Stroup. the executive direc-
tor of the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws. ex-
plains at least part of the decline is
because a growing number of states
are no longer arresting citizens for
simple marijuana infractions.

Stroup. however. said he was far
from satisfied with the new FBI
statistics: he pointed out the FBI‘s

SAD-EYED CHIMPS

Chimpanzees reportedly get
depressed and even cry in much the
same way humans do.

At least this is what researchers at
the Univrsity of Oklahoma are

reporting following the death of a
newborn primate born to a chimp
named Washoe.

Washoe is the ﬁrst chimpanzee to
be taught from birth to use sign
language to communicate with
humans.

Washoe delivered her own.aon
last week, .but after birth com-
plications" the baby died.
Researchers attending the chimp
repon. however. that Washoe ulcpt

profusely “Because the baby did not
move around“. and repeatedly tried
to get the infant to respond to her by
making the sign “baby.”

The Oklahoma scientists say
Washoc‘s sign language behavior in-
dicated she became depressed and
sorrowful after the death of her son,
in much the same way a human
would following the death of a loved
one. ‘

GROOVE ON CRIM

A sign of the times is the word 3‘ at
arrest records might not be such a
bad thing these days.

Two Washington D.C.
businessmen have launched a local
record company they plan to call
Arrest Records. The two en-
trepreneurs explain. “Now you can
have an arrest record and it won’t be
detrimental."

FUR TRAPPERS
County officials in Salt Lake City.
Utah—where congressman Alan
Howe was arrested recently by
policewomen posing as hookers—is
considering a ban against the use of
sex decoys. -

The decoys in this case. however.
are not the human types—but
“Doggie decoys". Salt Lake City‘s
Health Director Harry Gibbons is
pushing for a plan that would allow
the pound to use female dogs in heat
in order to attract and trap male
strays.

However. the City Animal Con-
trol Director Douglas Sorenson
argues that the use of “Doggie
decoys" amounts to entrapment.
Sorenson claims that it would be un-
fair because even well-mannered
dogs would be encouraged to stray
from home.

Sorenson warns: “The call of the
wild is stronger than backyard fen-
