I don't like blackberries. .

Baby Benjamin is confusing my
calendar.

I couldn‘t even find the theatre.
But eventually I did discover a group
of people in blue sweatshirts. tights,
and white gloves. The first of the
group were a green cap, and did all
the talking.

They were a blackberry vine. The
bearded part of the vine sang about
how stupid the little boy next to him
was. He had good reason to feel that
way. The little boy was saying a
stupid thing again and again.

“i cannot go away because 1 am all
alone,“ sang the little boy. There was
a little girl next to him, but she
wasn‘t stupid—except that she was
interested in the little boy.

There were other little boys and
girls. but they weren‘t teacher/ac—

tor/artists trying to be little girls
and boys. They were in the audience.

The audience also had adults. who
may have enjoyed Gertrude Stein's
First Reader more than the little
boys or girls. There are reasons for
this.

The major reason is that Gertrude
Stein plays with words. so that even
when the apparent idea is to educate
little girls and boys through enter-
tainment, the actual effect is to
amuse adults.

I. for example. was amused. it is
not clear whether I am a little boy or
an adult. but that was a helpful blurr
when i went to visit the Empire State
Youth Theatre lnstitute‘s first
regular production Sunday.

The institute, in addition to being
a very good idea. is a bureaucratic
enigma. Essentially. it is a special
program of SUNY Central.

That's enough explanation of the
bureaucracy.

The Institute teaches workshops.
There are interns from many schools
around the state. The interns work
with the teacher artists. They will
travel around to high schools and
other groups, performing their
shows and teachingtheir workshops.

This is paid for by taxes and con-
tributions.

That's enough explanation of the
inner working.

And the show was very informal.
Afterwards, the tescher/aetor/ar-

That was almost as good as the

Coffee and Cooneyat Gaffe

By SPENCER RAGGIO

Michael Cooney will probably
never make the cover of Rolling
Stone.

As he said Saturday night at the
Caffe Lena, “They tell me I'm just
short of getting one of those tin-foil
records—that means We sold one
hundred copies of my album."

But he keeps coming back to
bena's. and keeps selling out the
place. and keeps people singing
along and laughing until close to two
in the morning.

Why, though? His singing voice——
outside of bars and Cocktail
parties—is not exceptionally good,
and while he exhibits a facile com-
mand of both the guitar and banjo,
he didn‘t rcgaic the audience with his
virtuosity. either.

His choice of material is one fac-
tor. Cooncy‘s music springs from
tradilionnl folk backgrounds; the
bulk of his songs were old English

 

$1 .25 w/out

 

and Irish folk songs. drinking songs,
sailors tunes. railroad songs,
American traditional music, and a
few more recent contributions to the
folk library. And just about every
one was hilarious.

Mainly. though. the secret is inthe
man himself. With the ﬁrst few
words out of his mouth. Cooney
managed to put the audience at’ease,
sipping Japanese tea and nibbling at
banana bread in Lena's living room.
That Cooney was enjoying himself
was obvious. and that enjoyment
ﬂowed right on to the audience.

Cooney is one of those performers
with the rare ability to eliminate that
two-foot step from the floor to the
stage. And Lena's Caffe lends itself
to his abilities.

Through an unobtrusive
doorway. up a narrow white stair-
case and into the bohemian garrett,
lhe sparsely decorated cafe. Lena
greets each guest herself, seating

Lena’s request that there be no
smoking during the performance
was receiVed with applause, and
Michael Cooney asked that the
house lights be brought up while he
played. Again. a far cry from the an-
ticipated dark, smoke-ﬁlled club. In
a word, the Caffe Lena conducts its
business with class.

Hidden away on the side streets of
Saratoga Springs. Caffe Lena has
earned its widespread reputation in
the folk music world, and is well
worth the drive from Albany.
