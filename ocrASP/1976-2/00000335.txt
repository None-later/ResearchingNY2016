Silverman's two-run shot over the
leftfield fence in the home sixth kept
Albany from being shut out. It was
his eighth hit in his first 13 at bats so
far this season.

And as for the Albany pitching
staff. 24 runs allowed in ldinnings of
work is no! a good sign. Tomorrow
tne Danes travel to Oneonta and
they will get to face a real good hit-
ting team. What can happen next?
