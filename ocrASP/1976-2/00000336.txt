one might have thought it was the
middle of a raging hailstorm. in-
stead. it turned out to be a Sunday
afternoon baseball doubleheader at
University Field. And when they
cleared the wreckage. it was discern-
ed that Albany had beaten Potsdam
in the opener by a wild l5-ll score
before being clobbered in the night-
cap. Iii-2.

It was nothing short of amazing.
In the first game. the runs were being
piled up so suddenly and so un-

But Albany hadn't gotten to out
yet. And when they did. they took

Students Protest Colonial Parking-

' a"

by Diane Wenzler

The student protest Wednesday
against the pity parking lot. near
Coloniul Quad. has guaranteed them
a temporary halt ol‘eonstruction un-
til Monday. -»

The protest was first organized by
Colonial Quud students when they
discovered trees had been cut down
to make way for the construction of
the lot. The proposed site stretching
from Colonial Quad to the podium
and out to l‘eriutctcr Road would
deprive the st udcrtts of a recreational
field.

Michael Lissncr. Central Council
Representative for Colortinl Quttd.
conferred with Vice President for
Management and Planning. .lolm
Hurtigau on Wednesday to
deliberate possible alternatives for
the parking lot site. The alternative
site discussed is between Dutch and
Colonial Quutls behind the Social
Science building.

"The c xplorution of ttn alternative
site is being looked into.“ said l-lur-
tigurt. “l have asked the head con-
tractor to look into tltc possibility of
building the lot outside the Social
Science lluilding by tomorrowmorn—

ing.“ He said. “If all is feasible and
if the contractor can consider it sub-
stitution we then have a viable op-
tion."

011 lhursduy. Lissner was in-
formed by llurtigun that it is within
reason to switch the parking lot sites.
Problems did exist however. A slight
slope. the transplanting of trees and
a voltage wirc running underneath
the lot would add to the cost of the
$38,000 budget for building the lot
and rcpnving two other lots.

“There would be no problem in
changing the site. only if the change
in cost does not go beyond l0% of
the original cost .“ says Lissner

Today at noon the decision will he
handed down to [issuer from llnr-
tigtut us to whether the original site
or the new site will be used for the
construction of the lot.

t Research into the implications of ’

Student Association Vice President
Gary Parker‘s refusal to sign a per-

i V eonal liability statement. uncovered

discrepancies among the rules which
govern the expenditure of a half-

million dollars of student tax money.

A clerical error. conflicting inf or-
mation in Student Association
master books. and possible con-
tradictions within the Finance
Policy. will force officials of the
association to completely overhaul
that policy.

The discrepancies were noticed
early Wednesday afternoon. after a
reporter for the Albany Student
Press and several strident govern~
ment officers researched the im-
plications of Vice President Parker's
refusal to sign astatement demanded
of him by SA Comptroller Nolan
Altman.

The situation prompted SA Presi-
dent Steve DiMeo tojoin Parker in
an appeal to Central Council to

overturn a bill which the council had,

previously passed. arid which
DiMeo had introduced and signed
into law. This bill added a clause
to Finance Policy which holds the
presidents and treasurers of ' all SA-
funded groups “personally liable for
any unauthorized expenditure... and
for any amount overspent in their
(the group’s) budget“.

Although Council Chairman Greg
Lessne originally cut off discussion
on the issue. his decision was later
overruled bythe council. Eventually.
the Council sent the bill to Finance
Committee. in effect. tin-doing
legislation which had been passed
two weeks before. Off-campus
Council Representative Cary Klein.
called this “an attempt to make sense
of our mitt-legislation“.

According to Finance Committee

will be written to replace the present

SUN Y A Woods Site Of Attempted Rape

by Jon Hodges

A Saint Rose College student us-
ing the SUNYA library became the
victim of an attempted rape behind
Colonial Quad early Monday excu-
ing.

The victim was studying in the
library when she noticed sotnermc
staring at her. The attacker cott-
tinned to loitcr in the urea and when
tltc student left ttt about nine o'clock.
he quickly followed.

The attacker caught up with the
girl by the Business Administration
building. llc grabbed her arm and
announced tlntt he had a knife and
not to resist. They then left the
podium. crossed to the west side of
Perimeter Road and entered the
wooded area north ofthc inl‘irmary.

Once in the woods the girl began
to scream. A passing pedestrian ran
to investigate and his approach caus-
ed the ttttucker to flee.

The victim contacted University
Police about one hour later. They
conducted a fruitless search ot the
Wooded area. The Police are seeking
the pedestrian for questioning.

tion of the personal liability clause.

Jewish Students Coalition; Presi-
dent VickiYudenfriend said that the
groups should have been informed
of the clattse before its passage. not
after its implementation. She said
that “if an event is held and the in-
come derived does not meet expec.
tations. then the group‘s ofﬁcers will
be financially responsible”. Yuden-
friend‘s feeling was that this would
not be right.‘ considering the
variables involved in planning
programming income.

Speakers‘ Forum Chairman Paul
Sommers indicated that he wouldn‘t
schedule any events past March or
April. to insure that his group’s
budget isn't overspent.

Sommers said that this constitutes
“inadequateprogramming". but that
he was concerned with the possibili-
ty of being held personally liable.
He added that “the personal liability
clause means that someone could be
completely incompetent. but that if
their budget is not overspent. its
okay“.

.Yudenfriend. Summers. and nine
other group leaders have expressed
their position in a letter they sent to
the Albany Student Press.
