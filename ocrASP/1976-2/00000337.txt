During the hour long session.
Hart told the ISattendants inthe lec-

Farley One Step Closer to Senate Seat

by Mark Greensleln

On election night inside his office
in the SUNYA Business Administra-
tion Building. Hugh Farley
answered the phone. and said.“lt
looks good. but we're not goingto let
up.“

After winning tlte Republican
nomination in what was referred to
as a “landslide” Farley said. “l'm
kind of tired. I‘ve been rather busy."
He said “Last night I got a good
night‘s sleep but you don't catch up
on sleep."

The Business Law professor said.
“It kind of restores your faith in the
political systent when you can win a
campaign like this on a modest cam-
paign effort by going to the people.“
He said. “I like to go out and meet
the people. I think that's how you
find out what‘s cooking." Farley
added. "I like to make their ideas my

ideas."

Farley now faces the Democratic
nominee. John Quinbywho upset in-
cumbent Fred lsabella Tuesday. “I
respect him as a formidable oppo-
nent," said Farley about Quinby.
“He was formidable enough to beat
the political Senator. He was
politically unknown but people get
to know you awfully fast when you.
run for Senate."

Large Margin

“I‘m a tire less campaigner.“
Farley admits. “The thing that
shocked everyone was the margin of
my victory.“

Farley's efforts will be ﬁnancially
a little easier now that the
Republican Committee will be sup-
porting his efforts. His district has
been a Democratic seat for the last
two terms. Farley is confident that

this term there‘s room for a

Republican.
Loves To Teitch

In regards to teaching at SUNYA
with a Senatorial seat in sight Farley
said. “I have a genuine affection for
my students. I lovetoteach." he said.
“lfl had to leave teachingentircly. i
think that would hurt me. I mean
this from the heart."

Farlcy's students share this con-
corn for their professor. (iasper
Castillo, a student in one of Farley's
classes said. “1 sort of ﬁnd it ex-
citing when I know one of my
teachers is a judge or a lawyer." He
continued. “It‘s like a double ex-
perience. lt‘ll he even more exciting
if he becomes Senator."

in regards to Farley‘s effectiveness
as a teacher. Castillo added. “He‘s

been pretty much keeping his class
obligations."

Colleen Hughes. also in Farley‘r
class. said. “This is my first semester
with him. i was glad he 'won. As far
as i can see his running didn‘t effect
his teaching.“

Concerning some issues in his
campaign. Farley. like his opponent
Quinby. wants to keep taxes down.
He also said. “l‘m concerned about

health of the State University."
Farley said of Quinby and his
views. “I may depart from him on
some of these issues.“ He said. “i
may be more moderate then him on
some issues." V
The SUNYA professor said.
“Quinby has been cited as apolitical
unknown. i do not know where he
stands on most of the issues."

SUNYA Scores Nationally in Sex Survey

Out of several schools sampled.
SUNYA has been rated IZth in sex-
ual activity according to an article in
Playboy magazine.

“What‘s Really Happening On
Campus." in the magazine's October
issue. listed schools throughout the
country and commented on the types
of males and females uttendingcach.

llesidcs looking at the schools. the
University of California at Los

More Aetlve

campus is rising.

in the 1970 Playhoysurvey. 49 per
cent of female students graduated
with more than their brains intact.
but by I976. this figure had dropped
to 26 per cent. Yet. in the same
period. the percentage of male
virgins rose from lit to 26 per cent.

Although the poll reveals 29 per
cent of the women consider simple
friendshipsufficient groundsfor sex-
ual intercourse. most student sexual
activityto‘daytakes place within fair-
ly monogamous relationships. Fifty-
five per cent of women and 47 per
cent of the men questioned had a life-
time total of three or fewer partners.

Sixty per cent of students disagree
strongly with the statement “I hope

to have an opcn'marriagc which
would include extramarital sex."
Another 57 per cent disagree strong-
ly with the statement “I'm not in-
terested in marrying. lhopeto haven
varied sex life. includinga number of
affairs.“

Although both politicians and the
general public are busy denouncing
Big Government. students say they
want more Government intervention
in almost every crew of life. par-
ticularly in enforcement of pollution
laws. according to the Playboy
survey.

Seventy per. cent favor hand-gun
control. and almost half want to
restore the death penalty. Students
generally favor stricter laws. heavier

penalties and mandatory therapy for
hard-drug users. (Only marijuana
and alcohol escapethis prohibition.)

Almost all students (94 per cent)
support equal economic and
political rights for women. while 79
per cent oppose any move to restrict
women‘s right to abortion. In fact.
67 per cent of Catholic students
question opposed the so-cslled
right-to-life amendment.

More Comervatlvc

Only 58 per cent of those polled
were optimistic about the future.
seventy-five per cent agree that there
has been a shift toward conservatism
among students. yet judging from
the statistics. most students have a
different definition oftconlervativc.

ed in and an 8-track stereo system
