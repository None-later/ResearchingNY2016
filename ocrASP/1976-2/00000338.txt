paler sports. Dippikill has a so
acre pond for‘ fishing. swimming,
canoeing. and row boating during
the warmer months. There are also
miles of hiking trails to explore.

During the winter months, Camp,
Dippikill lures a different kind of
sportsman. There are cross-country

swim in the ice-covered pond.
Tlseseare four isolated building
with a combined capacity of 68

(Farmhouse, Log Cabin, and Small
Cabin) are without water, or modern
toilets. It costs only one dollar and
fifty cents to rentabed forthe night.

Despite all'DippikiIl has to offer
few students have used the facilities
of the camp. Student Association
leaders felt that pan of the problem
might have stemmed from the lack of
convenient transponation to the
camp. SA therefore sent ' out
feelers to various bus companies.
resulting in a offer from Adirondack
Buslines to include Camp Dippikill
in it's upstate run. According to the
company. two buses will leave the
Administration Bus Circle each Fri-
day for Camp Dippikill. Each Sun-
day buses will pick up passengers at
Dippikili for the return run to
Albany. SA Vice President. Gary
Parker hopes that the contract will
be signed soon, and that runs to Dip-
pikill could begin as early as the
weekend of Sept. ls. |

West Point
Disappointment

WEST ISLIP, Niv. (AP) From the
time their only son was born,
Kenneth and Ann Curlcy wanted
him to be a West Pointer. They were
not disappointed.

They ‘wanted to savor his
successes—the medals. the awards
and the trophies. Again they were
not disappointed.

They wanted him to be a leader. at
the top of his class. He was.

Now he is a convicted West Point
cheater. and Ken and Ann Curley
say it is the worst thing that’s
happened since they lost one of their
five children to cribdeath syndrome.

The cheating charge has created
what Mrs. Curley calls a “living
nightmare” or recriminations from
friends and telephone calls from
cranks.

The plaques on the walls of their
modest Long Island home are a
testament to the hopes they had—
still have—for Kenneth Jr.. a strap-

Students Protest Colonial Parking Lot

“It was a quiet protest. not a con-
frontation between students and the
faculty. It is ourjoint voice speaking
out for what we feel is right." he:
said. "If the decision comes against
us there is going to be a confronta-
tion of some sort."

situation on Tuesday when two
students informed him about the
removal of the trees. He along with'a
few concerned students began a mass
program to gather students from the
Quad to attend the protest the
following day.

Petitions proclaiming the
students' disfavor with the parking
lot were signedby nearly a thousand
students and according to Lissner a
favorable response was shown by the
students when asked to be present at
the protest on Wednesday.

Wednesday morning trucks came
to pick up a bulldozer that had been
parked on the grass all night. The
constructors had wanted to take

down the one tree still obstruction
the building of the lot. Students.
however, prevented this procedure
by standing around the tree and
eventually the truck left. Students
stayed in the field from 7 am. until

4:30 .m. ~
The protest, originally planned for

three consecutive days, was
cancelled at the end of the first day.
since Hartigan gave the students his
assurance that construction would
be held off until Monday.

“Alternative sites must come
about by Friday. If by then nothing
has come about I feel we will go
ahead with the Colonial Quad park-
ing lot." said Hartigun.
