A new survey has discovered that

many Americans watch the evening

news on television because it makes

I them feel good to know some people
' are worse off than they are.

Doctor Walter Gantz of the State

. University of New York at Buffalo.

says a detailed telephone survey of
TV viewers has found that’a large
percentage of people don't watchthe
news to become informed. '

Instead. according to Gantz.
"One.fourth said they were strongly
motivated towutch the news because
they felt better knowing that others
had worse problemsthunthcy bud."

Gantz adds that ten percent
reported TV news helped them
forget their own problems while

negotiations to build a“Disneyland"
near Moscow. ‘

The Soviets are'said towant the
Disneyland built before the HBO
Olympic Games in Russia. and
Soviet delegates have reportedly
already visited Hollywoodto discuss
the project with Disney officials.

Parode says that the Disney crowd
is willing to provide teh technical
know-how for the Russian amuse-
ment park if the Soviets come up
with the right number of rubles.

IRON MAN

It had to happen sooner or later.

Researchers at the University of
Wisconsin Psychiatric Research In-
stitute have replaced psychiatrists
with is computer.

The Madison institute reports
that depressed patients ttre often
treated by being given a set of
questions which they read and then
punch the proper responses into a
machine. The answers are later
evaluated by psychiatrists.

The institute says that the com-
puter works better than conven-
tionul psychiatrists working with a
couch. because depressed patients
tell the machine inner secrets they
might never reveal to a human
therapist.

FUELSYNTHESIO ‘ . » '
A n‘obel prize-winning chemist'is'
suggesting that scientists could solve
the world's fuel crisis simply’by
growing gasoline on trees.
Doctor Melvin Calvin. speaking
at a meeting of the American
Chemical Society in San Francisco.

 

 

says that scientists now have the
technology to extract energy from a
variety of presently growing
plants—without waiting a few
million years for them to fossilize
and turn to oil. '

One promising specimen for a
US. gas pluntution. Calvin says, is a
tree called the Euphorbiu. which
gives off it latex that can easily be

.rcl'tncd into gasoline or other
petrochemical products.

Culvin reports that a major plan-
ting of the Euphorbia will he started
next spring in Riverside. Culifornia.
He predicts :“You might get between
l0 and 50 barrels of oil per acre per
your from the plants.“

EROTIC SCENT

If you think Ginseng and other
herbs will turn on your lover. there‘s
it New Rochelle. New York. com-
pany which will sell you ﬁve capsules
of the stuff for $4.95.

The Food and Drug Administra-
tion has cracked down on the un-
usual capsules which are marketed
as an aphrodisiac culled “Impulse.”
saying the herbs won't do anything
for you. As a result. US attorney,
Robert Fiske is scekingu restraining
order ttgttinst a firm called
“Progressive Stiles" which markets
the herbs. 'l‘he “Impulse” uds suy .
their prodttct “Lets you have sex
with ttnyonc you desire
anytime!" But FDA expert Vincent
Cordnro says the “Impulse” powder
is simply “Carefully blended exotic
spices." -

The post office reports that hun-
dreds of Women and men have
responded to the national ud cum-
puign for “Impulse.”

STEVIE WONDER

Stevie Wonder‘s many-times-
deluyed double album has been
shelved once again.

The record set that was originally
scheduled for release last Spring will
now probably be withheld from the
public until at least the middle of this
Fall. '

Rolling Stone magazine reports' *
that one of the latest problems with '
the project is that Wonder has
recorded additional material. and
may want to release a thee-record
set instead of a double LP.
