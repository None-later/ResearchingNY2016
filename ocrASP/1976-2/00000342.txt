By JON R; HAND

.The cinema is 'now eighty-one
years old._What is this form of
expression all abdut? On what
aesthetic grounds does it take
pride as an independent and un-
ique art form? How much in its
brief history has the cinema real-
ly accomplished? What directors
deserve to be called ‘artists'? Is
there more to this medium than
the Marx Brothers?

Nearly everyone takes part in
the enjoyment of this exciting
visual medium. The art of the
motion picture has left its mark
on the. twentieth century by
becoming the most powerful. the
most effective and the most loved
visual communication.

Yet it is only inthe past twenty
years that it has become the topic
for learned study and scriousdis-
cussion. Only now is film regard-
ed as highly as the other art
forms: painting. drama. music.
etc.

The questions posed above
havo been the cause of intensive
debate. Numerous aestheticians.
critics. and filmmakers have
tried to resolve them and. though
the controversy may seem

and distinctive forms have been
generally agreed upon. The
cumulative‘effect of all this study
has been the- creation of a
literature of film: an apprecia-
tion of the intrinsic nature of the
medium and its true'aesthetic
worth. We now have the
resources to judge good art in the
cinema. , When we add an
historical perspective. the task
becomes even easier.

Almost all of the total output
of film since its creation has been
within a narrative structure; we
go to the movies to be told a
story. SuccessiVe fast moving im-
ages pass before our eyes in a
darkened theater. We sit ‘en-
tranccd and watch patiently.
Eventually the many images
begin to make sense; we become
aware of time and space. This
character enters. dialogue is ex-
changed. this character leaves.
Thcn another enters. ——
Suddenly the scene has shifted;
another scene jumps into view.
Perhaps some more dialogue and
then we find ourselves off again
to another place and time.
Minutes pass. the plot thickens.
And so the images continue to
flicker by. and our story begins
to take shape.

it is not readings novel. listening
to music. or glancing at a pain-

After the primitive discoveries
of Lumierey and
theatrical works of Melies. the
motion picture developed into
maturity. Within the course of
seven years (1908-1915). DLW.
Griffith attempted to replace
earlier static theatrical work with
genuine film presence. The ar-
tificiality of films like Trip to the
Moon (l903-Melies) met its first
serious challenge.

Basically. Grifﬁth imposed
law and order onto the screen; he
felt the need that film had to
somehow define itself as an art
form independent of others.
Crucial to Griffith‘s beliefs. and
the later basis ofthe entire art of
cinema. was the realization that a
film is composed of numerous
separate pieces of celluloid. The
Soviet director Pudovkin was

SHOTS. Ultimately. a motion

picture is derived from the com-‘

position and arrangement of
these shots into some kind of
overall order and unity. The in-
terrelationship of these shots.
their juxtaposition. combined
with the temporal spacial
qualities they produce. resulted
in the creation of a totally new
and unique ncsthcticcxpericncc.
During the climax of Birth Of”
Nation (1914-15), Griffith inter-
cuts action occuring at several
different spacial areas at the
same time; close-ups. medium
shots, and tracking shots are
edited in a controlled and
brilliant form. The essence ofthc
film becomes a powerful
thrusting of image against image
complete with intensive rhythms.
textures and movements. Short
bursts of moving light collide
across tl1c'scrccn in an effort to
convey the excitement and

pathos of the final episode of tile
narrative. Thus. the power of tile
medium is conveyed through the
power'ol'ihc cditcd shot. . g

It is. indeed. ironic that Grif-
fith. who had at first‘drenmed of
a career in theater. was the first
to free the cinema of its heritage
as 11 poor cousin to theater. His
subsequent influence on other
directors was enormous. Both
the Soviet development of Mon-
iugc and the narrative tradition
of America and Europe have
their beginnings in Griffith‘s
work.

Acslhctically. the discovery of
tin: vitality of the shot was only
natural if thc medium was to
develop on its own; it became ihc
basis for all fut urc serious work. '
As the painter uses patches of

film-artist now had the shot.
Film had found its basic
material.
