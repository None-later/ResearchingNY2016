osborneill‘artis sleek. serious and
t-spoken. His words firm. his
yle low key._He's political but not
rbearln‘g. He's a socialist.
u\Tihysotdlllqm'i” ‘

I got involved in the student
ovement in 1970, the black libera-
on movement in particular.
hrough them I became familiar
lththe’Soeialist Workers Party and
e Young Socialist Alliance.
bout a year and a half ago I joined
e Young Socialist Alliance.

“How did you get from black
beration to socialism - in other
ords how are the ideologies of the

0 groups compatible'r'

In terms of achieving black
iteration it's going to take a total
attrition of :this society—a corn-
ined revolution of women. blacks.

chicanos and other Latin
Americans... Through socialism,
blacks and other minorities would
achieve national liberation.

A Pentel marker hangs off his
champagne-colored jersey shirt.
Glasses. Thin brown round horn
rims. Neat moustache. Looks older
than his 24 years. He's traveling
throughout the northeast. making
speeches insupport of Peter Camejo,
the Socialist Workers Party
presidential candidate. His talk
covers various issues. including how
the upcoming presidential election
relates to students in terms of cut-
backs.

How does Pctcr Cumch differ
from the Democratic and
Republican nominees?"

The Democratic and Republican
campaigns/amt on the personalities

of their candidates. This is part of .
American capitalistic system
politics. Socialists believe the impor-
tant thing is the platform—what a
party stands for. The Socialist

Workers Party platform supports
the ERA. abortion, free education.
the right of any man to a job. free
medical care. a bill of rights for
working people...

“What do you think of Carter?“

He's no different from the rest of
them [politiciaru]. Talks about his
peanut farm. He hasn’t picked any
peanuts. What he's got is a.multi-_
million dollar operation.

“What do you mean ‘no different'
from the rest of them? Do you mean
that there‘s no difference between
Democrats and Republicans?"

Democrats and Republicans are
[lit' same asfar as who they repre-

sent,’t‘vhich it'llargecorporotl‘
Carter approved the Georgia

" penalty. Both Ford and Carter skirt»

the abortion issue and, neither of
them has said an ythirt‘g about South
Africa.

Hart speaks with onlya hint ofthe ,
drawl of his native North Carolina. '

A graduate of Morehousc College
and a political science major. he now
lives in Atlanta. Georgia. He hasn‘t
returned to his hometown; 'Ashville
for six years'except for an occasional
visit. He won't talk about his
family:“My politics and life since I
left home are entirely different.”He's
worked at construction. banking
and various other jobs. Currently.
Hart is running for Congress in
Georgia's fifth Congressional dis-
trict.

We defend both Chinese and

However, we dislike the totalitarian
