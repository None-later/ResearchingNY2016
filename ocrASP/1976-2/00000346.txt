W research for the
"Research 'Group for Human
Dave/opined 7’ at Stony Brook on
issues of higher educationi A few
weeks ago'he fulﬁlleda year-old
pramilre and consented to an inter-
view With’r'eporter Daniel Gainer.
“When I came. the mission of the
StateU niversity was eitplicitly stated
in the m‘a'ster plan. and the missions
of the schools were carefully stated.
and I assumed that my job was to
help fulfill their missions.” says
Benezet. adding that he had thought
it,would be “presumptuous” to say
himself what the schOol should be
doing.

Back in I969. when ﬁrst appointed
SUNYA President. Benezet said he
looked forward to “a unique oppor-
tunity todirectthe growth ofa major
new university with a multiple mis-
sion in arts. sciences, and
professional schools.“ It didn‘t work
out that way.

“What happens when you have a
setback?" he asks today. “As it turn-
ed out. I had five years of a retrench-
ment philosbphy. We had our
missions—~We thought—but we‘ve
been bulked on this. . .the state is
not going ahead with the growth
pattern it had laid down for us.
Therefore. how do we redefine the
kind of missionthat a university can
live with when it can't do all the
things that it has been committed to
do. . ."

Benezet believes missions cannot
be planned. Rather. they can he
designed to take advantage of what
is already there. Thus, it‘s hard to be
very philosophical about a mission.
But he feels strongly about one ex-
ception: “What is going to be your
concept of a college of liberal arts

and sciences? This, lthink; does have

. something to do with the general

character of a place. Veryearly in my
time at Albany. . .I made no bones
about statingmy belief. . .that most
of the great universities. no matter
what specialties they have
developed. all have a strong. basic
arts and science college. Jf you start
splintering that. then your very fun-
damental. academic fields that
presumably draw from each
other. . .can each go his own way.
and l think that this is a bad pattern
[in which] to confront the major
problems of society."

Benezet feels that the key decision
for Albany is between an academic
graduate center and a professional
graduate center. “Albany is both."
he says. “but in New York, its status
will be made or broken on the
recognition of its academic
programs.“

Benezet realized how Albany‘s
“mixed bag of young. ambitious
professional schools" have inﬂuenc-
ed it‘s character. “The old teacher‘s
college. then they split off the
business school.thencriminaljustice
came in as a kind of flower child.
then. as a result of local pressures,
the nursing school was brought in,
and now is goingout. . .thenit pick-
ed up public affairs. which had ex-
isted free standing for years in
Albany."

Benezet guided the school through
the turnaround: Fields hadinherited
“the crunch".

“We made one. resounding
failure. _ .we never succeeded in
bringing in and retaining a dean of
arts and sciences who could unite the
missions of the divisions.“ says
Benezet. who sees this as the major
problem with the controversial arts
and science dean. l. Moycr

 

There Were many other contra

sies while Benezet was at Albanyand .

many of them were tenure eases. His
present attitude? . 2
“Unfortunately. this has

been‘

progressively centralized. . .ssi

management is given a sharper and-

sharper mandate to ,account for.
resources. . .it‘s going to get' more
and more of both power and the
necessity to ' use the power in
decisions over .people's
futures. . .Until we get off this ex-
treme note of management aecoun4
tability. austerity and scarcity. your
decisions are going to be more and
more centralized and conservative. '

Benezet supported increased stu?
dent power on campus. including
representation on the UAS (FSA)
Board of Directors and the Universi-
ty Senate. “I‘ve never regretted steps
that have been taken to enlarge the
area of student responsibility." says
Benezet. To those who doubt stu-
dent ability. he says: “If you're so
afraid of the situation that youthink
the place is going to be subverted if
you let them into it. then I don‘t
think you have a very good basis for
integrity in your campus to begin
with.“

Does he like administration? “I
think that administration is the most
challenging art there is. because
you‘re dealing withthc most variable
and unpredictable element there is.
namely human nature. and high

  

geared and well-educated. and
sometimes higth vocal human
nature. . 

“This year I had an almost terrify-
ing experience. for the first few
weeks. sitting at this desk inthis little
office: ‘What am I supposed to do

 

next hour’l' You know h

 

books. here's   I A '2

they pay me for this?‘
' ’Iienezet had: been in college sd-‘
ministration over a quarter century
until t5. months ago; “.The" ad-i
ministrative rhythm is an entirely
different one. its just bang. bang.
bang." - ' .

Now he‘s on his own: “It's a great-
discipline to be thrust back on
yourself. and say ‘Look. you're sup-
posedly living among educated peo-
ple and you had an education
yourself once and you have been
reading a few books and meeting a
few thousand people—what are you
going to do with it?" ' —

He‘s learning new habitsmnd'says
he's trying to Write better: “if you‘re
an administrator you write of the im~
mediate scene and out of a great deal
of very superficial observation and
of course that won‘t go in the realm
of scholarship. You've got to know
what you're talking about. not what ,
you thought last hour."

“I hope in myadvancing years. I‘m
getting a better chance to discover

'mysell as a thinking person." says

Benezet, pointing out what may have
been the key to his decision to retire
from administration.

Benezet‘s present research centers
on the effect a college administration
has on the value systems of students
at that college.

“Does the way a college is
operated and run itself have an in-

t: it. , "wards
societyl‘f no lsrteut._’H
this "psst year in the mute: "g‘
the opinions'ol' students. fs'ettltymnd
administrators on that isiue. The
results? '

They agreed that colleg's chief
function is to “provide a‘ broad
liberal education for intellectual and

personal development. career orien- 4 -

tation 'being .held secondary.”
Benezet reported. Also. “students
perceive the college organization as a
power structure capable of con-
trolling educational quality.”

He adds: “Unlike most professors
who tend to regard the faculty as the
essential college organization.
students see administration as being
needed to balance faculty with stu-
dent interests.” Another linding was
that “a majority of students and an
even larger majority of faculty in the
sample believe that the college
organization has an impact on
students. Most of these feel that the
impact is more often negative than
positive.“ ' I

Benezet also‘ did a study of the
dual public/private higher educa-
tion system in terms of college im-
pact on students. About that. he
wrote an article called “A Frontal
Approach to College Impact" that
appeared in the December. I975
issue of Liberal Education.
