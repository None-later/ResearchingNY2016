district last year. ‘

The list of walking wounded is a
mile long for both teams. Albany
linebacker Brad Kelhenback is out
with a knee injury. Halfback Glenn /
Sowalskie and backups Tony
Matyszczyk and Kevin Klein will be
questionable until game time, as will

be the services of linebacker Gerry -

Bennett and defensive back Harry
McDonouin.‘

Despite nagging injuries,Dave 

Ahonen will be at the helm for the
Danes and DeBois will be at his
.familiar fullback slot with Speedy
Orin Grifﬁn the right halfback. Tom
Cleary will bethe tight end and Lynn
Pinkston has earned ashot at wide

who broke a bone in his hand.

Ithaca will either start injured
quarterback Fred Cauﬁeld or his
backup Scott Thon. Caufield, who
threw for six-hundred yards in a
backup role last year. is very adept at
runni'ng’the offense. Ctiuﬁeld missed
last week‘s game and Thon found
things rough going as he gained only
twenty-six yards on ten carries while
connecting on one of three passes for
ten yards.

Dave Pitzer, last year‘s leading
ground gainer. will be the fullback
due to the injury of Mike Baler.
When either Caufield or Thon go to
the air. they will be looking for
speedy Mike Battle who was on the
receiving end nineteen times last
year. .

The Danes defense will see two
new faces. John Veruto will replace
Kelhenback and Ken Paulo will
replace McDonough if he is not
ready to go. The Danes on defense
will have to contain the running of
Pitzer and Cauﬁeld and get the ball
for the offense, according to Ford.

This game mightjust decide what
type of year both these clubs Can
look forward to. Both cannot come
away winners, and one team will
come away 0-2.

WSUA will broadcast the
game beginning at l:20 p.m. Steve
Leventhal and John Fallon will be
the announcers.
