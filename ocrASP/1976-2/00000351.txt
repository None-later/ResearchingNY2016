The Albany State varsity golf
team opened its fall season Tuesday
with an i l-stroke loss to Siena at the
Colonic Golf Club. Coach Doc
Sauers. however. was pleased with
his team‘s showing “The boys are
dedicated and anxious. and that's a
good sign."

He was referring to Rick Porter.
Mike Dulin. Frank See. Dick
Derrick. John Ammertnan. Jim
McKilIip. Graham ltlake, and Mark
Stanlea. Those eight golfers survived
thecut of 169attryouts heldthis past
weekend. “I believe we got the best
team out of the tryouts." said Sauers.
“We're steadier. and a good half~
dozen strokes better as a team."

Porter. whoretitrns to Albany
after a year's absence. was low man

field in the ECAC tournament. His

in the next week with Albany travell-
ing to Plattsburgh Saturday for the
Cardinal Invitational. returning for
the Siena Invitational on Monday.
and trekking to New Paltz on Tues-
day to face Onconta.

“Our immediate goal is (a stroke
average of) 80." noted Sauers while
glancing at Albany's 82.3 average
against Slena. “It would place us In
the top five.“ he said, in reference to
the upcoming SUNYAC at
Cooperstown. The feeling is that you
can look for good things from this

Albany-Ithac a: Loser Bowl?

by Craig Bell

Last year. the winner was assured
to come away with the Lambert
Bowl. In this year‘s grid match
between Ithaca College and Albany
State the winner comes away with a
.500 record.

Ithaca lost their first regular
season game in two years last Satur-
day. when they droppcd a 24-0 dcci~
sion to St. Lawrence. in their season
opener. The Danes did not do much
better as they were blanked by
Southern Connecticut. IO-O. It was

the first time Albany has been shut
out since Ithaca turned the trick last
year. 33-0.

Iioth teams. however. were hurt
by injuries and inexperience. and
this. in part. explains the surprising
opening day losses by both squads.

Albany has been waiting all year
for this game after last year's disap-
pointing showing. “They‘rc still a
damn good football team but at least
they‘re human this year." said
Danc's head football coach Bob
Ford. Ford is referring to the fact

that Ithaca has lost offensch stars
quarterback ,Jcrry lioycs and wide
receiver Bill liryanl. in addition to
ten starters from last year‘s defensive
ttnit.

Albany. however. will have to
show more offensch consistency
than they did last week. “Wc‘dliketo
establish our insidc game with
DeBlois, but we will take what they
give us.“ said Ford. The passing at-
tack will havcto shape up. according
to Ford. as he was not happy with

University Police arrested eleveit
students yesterday as they attempted
to block the construction of a pay
parking lot near Colonial Quad.

The students. who had placed
themselves in front of a bulldozer.
were charged with disorderly con-
duct and have been ordered to
appear in Albany Police Court next
Monday.

University Police refused to arrest
SA President Steve DiMeo. also
blocking the bulldozer. DiMeo ask-
ed to' be arrested with the other
sludcnts. but his rcqucstwas denied.

The protest was a last effort to
save what is a prime recreational
area for Colonial Quad residents.

The ten hour demonstration
began around seven am. as over one
hundred students gathered where.
construction was to begin.
Bulldozers arrived soon after ten
o'clock. but the removal of surveyor
markers earlier this week. held up
work.

The construction crew returned at
two o'clock along with administra-
tion and security personnel. As the
workers began surveying the area.
students spread out. playing with
frisbecs and footballs. The bulldozer
proceeded to the far corner of the
field. and students followed and sat
down in front of it. After a short
while. Director of Physical Plant.
Frank Kopf spoke to the students
through a bullhorn.

“I work for the Plant Depart-
ment." Kopf told the students. “We
have jurisdiction over and respon-
sibility for this area. . .1 direct you
to leave this area immediately. Your
failure to do so will result in the
violation of regulations three and
seven of the Student Guidelines and
we will take the proper action."

Kopf then proceeded to distribute
copies of the guidelines to the
students. According to the
guidelines. the students would be
“obstructing and distrupting an
authorized university ac-
tivity. . .failing to comply with the
directions of authorized university
officials acting in the performance of
their duties. . .“

Kopf then called for a fifteen
minute discussion period to answer
the students' questions. During the
discussion. students voiced their
grievances to Kopf. who steadfastly

time ended, Kopf closed the discus?
sion and once again introduced
himself and ordered the students to
leave the area.

The students. visibly unhappy
with the meeting. refused to move.
Sho'rtly thereafter. they were
ordered to give both their names and
student identification numbers to
university ofﬁcials. The students
complied with the request. It was
then announced that SUNYA presi-
dent Emmett Fields had returned to
the campus and would meet with
DiMeo about the situation. .

About half an hour later. DiMeo
emerged from the meeting and
returned to the demonstration.
There he told rain drenched
protestors the outcome of the
meeting.

“He asked about what was going
on and I told him everything.“
DiMeo said. "I told him that the peo-
ple want a say on things that happen
to the place they live. I said to him
that if he wantcdthis parking lotthat
badly. he'd get it but not without sen-
ding a number of kids to jail."

According to DiMeo. Fields ask-
ed him whether it was a wise thing
for him to do as SA president.“l told
him that if they start arresting peo-
ple. I go ﬁrst." DiMeo said. Fields
then declared that the planned con-
struction would go on as scheduled.

Fields then instructed the ad-
ministrators who were on the scene
to do whatever was' necessary to
begin construction. Acting Vice
President for Finance and Business
John Hartigan, who has been in-
volved in the situation since its early
Stages, issued the final order to
students to leave the area.

“President Fields felt that the deci-
sion in this matter had to come from
people who were on the scene." said
Hartigan. "As such. responsibility
fell on Dr. Welch (Vice President of
University Affairs) and myself to see
that the university honor its contrac-
tual committment to begin work to-
day."

An announcement was made that
if the students did not clear the area.
arrests would begin. A dozen
students remained blocking the
bulldozer. Members of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety read each stu-
dent their rights and escorted them
into an awaiting bus where they were
seated and handcuffed.

SASU Plans Future At SUN YA Conference

by Paul Rosenthal

Student government leaders from
throughout the SUNY system con-
vcrgcd on Albany this past weekend
to discuss the future goals of their
coordinating body. SASU,

Tltc Student Association of the
State University held its regular
planning conference here on the
SUNYA campus.

The conference participants Infor-
mally exchanged views in several
current student endeavors. Discuss-
ed wcrc the ongoing voter registra-
tion project. the continuing budget
slashes at SUNY schools. and the
special problems of women and
minority students.

SUNYA SASU delegate Diunnc
Piche said the conference was more
of a “workshOp situation" than a
politically oriented gathering. She

said that although the conference
was not well-attended. “people were
very positive" about the decision-
making that faces SASU and each of
the participating student
governments.

Student presidents. vice
presidents. and treasurers arrived
here Thursday night for a full
schedule of seminars and
workshops. Friday‘s discussions
generally centered on economic
issues that will affect SUNY students
in the upcoming year.

Strategies were planned for deal-
Ing with the current fiscal situation.
including a recent Board of Regents
recommendation that suggested
higher tuition at public colleges and
universities.

The particular problems of
women and SASU‘s “Third World

Caucus" were also topics of debate at
the conference.

With respect to women's issues.
Piche said the situation “has
definitely improved." but has along
waytogo. Females now occupy seats
as presidents and treasurers of
various SUNY student
governments. Piche feels that
women are now “very well
represented" in student politics.

Minority students will continue
their discussion next weekend at Os:
wego at a “Third World Caucus"
meeting to take place there. The
caucus has been a seperate wing of
SASU designed to deal with the
special problems of blacks and
Hispanics at SUNY schools.

This weekend's conference stress-
cd that student governments should
seek to planfor the future. Especially

in regard to legislative issues. the
opinion was cxpressedthat more un-
ity and organization was required to
deal withthc state bureaucracy effec-
tivcly.

A committment was made to the
CUNY Student Senate of mutual
help in the event of further budget
slashes.

Some discussion took place at the
conference about the concept of stu-
dent unionization. It was reported
that the Geneseo Student Associa-
tion may commit $8000 to SASU to
study the possibility of a statewide
student union.

Piche said the conference was un-
usually productive. in that there
were no internal political decisions
to be made. Site said “people had a
lot of time" to seriously participate
in the workshops.

possibility that one person is respon-
sible for both crimes based on the
description. the location. and mode
of operation. No weapon was used in
either case. according to Henighan.

Henighan said there “has been a
problem with both of these cases" in
that victims did not notify police im-
mediately and he recommended that
day one who is assaulted or harrass-

soon as possible.
