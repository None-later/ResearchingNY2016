Class at am President Marc Banach. thinks things will be dliiarent
this year; the Class Is $4,000lnthe rcdiromiastyear'a programming.

~ In em. wahy

- Over the past two years. the class
of '78 has developed a'reputationfor
throwing the most lavish and most
frequent class sponsored parties on
campus. '

Things may be different this year.
The class of "78 has been informed
that they owe University Auxiliary
Services $4,387.74 for "their “ex-
travaganzas" according to Student
Association Controller Nolan Alt-
man.

Altman said that accounts at the
end of the fiscal year last June
revealed the debts. which he said
resulted from the class' "spending
more than they took in“ for their
social activities.

Class programs are sponsored en-
tirely by class dues which are an op-
tional student expense and are not
subject to SA regulation.

,‘Clais of 478 president Marc
Benecke said that “excessive spen-
ding over the past two years” was the
cause for the debts but he was op-g.

r timistic about resolving them.

“We are in the process of working
out a comprehensive payment plan
right now." he said. “We expect at
least $7000 in dues this year and we
willcertainly have enough money for ‘
Senior Week."

Benecke said that approximately
80 per cent of his class pays the op-
tional dues and he attributed this
high figure to the students' satisfac-
tion with how the money is used.

“They feel they‘re getting their
money’s morth.” Benecke said. “At
least thirty people have come up and
asked me so far this year when our
first party will be."

Beneeke has had to explain to
them that things may be different

Off Campus Group to Study CDTA Buses

by Corinne Bernstein

The Off Campus Association will
obtain tokens for student volunteers
to ride various Capital District Tran-
sit Authority buses and eventually
make transportation information
available for SUNYA students.

Director. student volunteers. each

eampus living to all students."
(irill said. “Anything OCA does is
for all students. Even ifthey present-
ly live on campus. we‘re assuming
that eventtntlly students will move
off campus. after they graduate or in
their sophomore. junior. or senior
years."
C D T A Confusion
According to Grill. tnost students
know only about the green SUNYA
buses and those who do use tltc
CDTA. for example. those who live
In Albany. use it out of necessity.
There are no CDTA bttscs
currently running on campus.
(irill said students without cars
must live close to the husline. He

believes it necessary to know where
students live. in order to know their
transportation needs.

Project Planned

(irill would like to arrange a pro-
jch to locate all off-campus students
and compile a geographic indicator
to show where students live.

Currently, students can take
SUNYA buses down Western and
Washington Avenues and to the
Wellington where they can catch
CDTA buses.

CDTA schedules are available in
tltc ()CA lounge in the Campus
Center.

Any student may volunteer to
observe the buses.

Flashers Exhibit on

by lieverly llearn
Within the last few weeks. several

exhibitionists have been reported on

campus here. Descriptions vary. so it
appears that more than one man is
involved.

James Williams. Director of Un-
iversity l’olice.says that reports ltave
been forwarded to the police after
the flasher disappears. Most victims
describe a good-looking white male
in his early twenties wearing blue
jeans and sometimes a trenchcoat.
Incidents have been reported in tire
Colonial. Indian. and State parking
lots. but all areas are being checked
by campus police.

Williams said. “He has been
‘vagucly associated with a white
Chevy. lie approaches someone and
drops his pants and goes on his way.“

Williams said, “He does not (nntll

think it is important to emphasize
this) fit the description of the fellow
involved in the attctnptcd rttpc ttcar
the library and Colonial Quad
several nights ago."

One of the llasher‘s victims
described an incident that occurred
two weeks ago.

She said. “I was parking my car in
State Quad going to class. He drove
up as lwns parking, ttnd l tltought he
needed directions. l’lc signaled and
pulled up along the other side. He
got out of his car and ltis pants were
already undone. i guess. I was look-
ing at his face and didn‘t realize what
he was saying."

The girl said she then realized his
pants were undone. She said. "i
grabbed my stuff and took off."

Another woman. a part-time stu-
dent nt SUNYA. described the man

Last year accordingto Bessecke his
class threw “seven or eight'l panics
while the others threwf‘oneortwo".
Last year's Class of '78 Treasurer
JodyShaeffcr says she doesn't un-
derstand what happened and that.
she is attempting'torfind out. She
said she had very little to ‘do with a‘p-3

“voted on by the class council" and
that she personally felt too much

* money was being spent on the class'

parties.

Shaeffer also claimed that the
class had been “billed an excessive
amount" by the Office of Student
Life for damages that resulted from
last year‘s Halloween party.

Benecke rcminisced about the first
party his class sponsored when he
was a freshman and the newly
elected class president, the ofﬁce to
which he was reelected last year.

“It was the best party ever on
Colonial Quad. there were
something like l500 people there.
From that point we had eyents at
Dutch. Downtown. and the Campus
Center ballroom." he said.

According to Benecke. the climax
was the “Halloween Costume Ex-
travaganza“ sponsored by the class
of '78 which took place last year in
the Campus Center ballroom.

"We‘ve cher thrown an on-
successful party in terms of student
enjoyment.“ lienccke claimed.

He said ltc began to realize things
were not altogether well when he was
shown accounts last April indicating
the large losses.

lieneckc spent this past summer
working as a Deputy Treasurer for
the Moynihan Campaign in New
York City.

“I've learned a lot about financial
procedures and accounting. i don't
expect to be pressured by the UAS
for the money or to have to pay it off
in one lump sum." He added that
"we're not the only group that owes
money."

licneekc is confident that his class
will ltavc the $7.000 to $l0.000 he
says will be necessary to have a
senior week by next year.

In the meantime Benecke expects
that jointly sponsored class parties
will provide adequate recreation. He
said. “The class councils seem to be
cooperating and we expect to throw
joint parties with other classes."
