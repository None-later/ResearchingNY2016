PAHRY-NOID.
Researchers at Stanford Universi-
ty have programmed a computer to
simulate a paranoid human being
The mentally-ill program has been
nicknamed “Parry” because it

simulates the personality of a ﬁc-‘

tional 28-year-old-single post office
worker named Parry, who believes
he is being hunted down by the
Mafia.

Science Digest Magazine reports
that Parry is the creation of Doctor
Kenneth Colby. who is attempting to
develop a human-like subject whom

 

psychiatry students can experiment

with. It was feared that student
analysts might do more harm than
good for a real. live paranoid. so
l'arry was created instead.

Parry. when asked questions. in-
evitably gets around to tal king a bout

  
  

the Maﬁa and how ‘fThey" are after

him. Parry insists“ that " the un-
derworld is out to get him because he
once beat up a bookie. -

Science Digest reports that ateam
of psychiatrists once submitted
written questions to Parry and to
human subjects and was unable to
diagnose which replies came .from
the machine.

MONSTER FAMILY

The Loch Ness Monster may have
a cousin living in Switzerland.

The tabloid newspaper B/irk in
Zurich reported this Week that a
uDragon~likc" monster emerged
snorting on the surface of Lake Uri
last Saturday in sight of dozens of
witnesses.

The alleged monster was said to
have made its appearance some 300
yards from the shore. and photos
taken at long range reportedly show
a dark humped object in the water.

Blit'k printed an enlargement of
the snapshot of the "monster".
alongside a similar picture pur-
ported to depict Nessie. the Loch
Ness Monster.

The newspaper said that the two

photos appeared *Ama'ainﬂiy alike”.
both of them showing serpentlllie
heads and humped backs.

Bin-k quotedva local boat'attcn- _

dant as saying that “Suddenlyl saw
an object in the water about Is
meters long and two meters high”.
The attendant added; “I saw from
the side a head and a humped-back
like a dinosaur." -

HANKY PANKY

A team of west coast investigators
is charging that a number of inﬂuen-
tial American figures—including
Henry Kissinger. President John
Kennedy and Doctor Martin Luther
King. Jr.. have been the targets of
sexual blackmail schemes.

The investigators. who have
authored a report on their findings.
are Fernando Faura. Donald Freed.
Michael Castleman and Jeff Cohen.

According to their report.
Kissinger became the target of a sex
plot six years ago that was allegedly
hatched by leading organized crime
figures. .

However, the report indicated the
scheme against Kissinger was not
successful. The investigators claim
organized crime chieftain Sidney
Korshack attempted to gain in-
lluenoe with the secretary of state by
introducing Kissinger to actress Jill
St. John. '
