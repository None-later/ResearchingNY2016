‘There are pianists Who depend
upon techniCal pyrotechnics» to
reveal the expressive properties of
music. Musical subtleties are often
glossed over in the virtuo‘stie display.
v Paula Ennis‘ performance at the
Recital Hall on Friday evening.
' made nosuch omission. Her mastery
of musical color and tone was
everywhere apparent in her perfor-
fmanees of Schubert’s Sonata in B
flat major and Beethoven‘s Sonata in
C minor Opus II 1. Perhaps it was
the packed audience that inspired
Paula Ennis to her ﬁne performance.
More likely Ms. Ennis, now 30. has
begun to reach her maturity. It was a
thoroughly planned performance.
executed as completely and exactly
as her introductory remarks in-
dicated. She is a student of
Menahem Pressler and has adopted
some of her master's pianissimostyle
while maintaining an available
reserve of power.

The first half of the concert con-
sisted of Schubert‘s B-flat major
sonata, a work executed in the com-
poser's last year of life. It is not a vir-
tuostic work, but one whose sub-
tleties demand complete control of
the piano's powers. I! is a lyric work.
full of humor and pathos. The per-
formance was beautifully" un-
derstated. and Paula Ennis‘ control
of colors and dynamic shifts was ex-

uisite. .
The second half of the perfor-

mm‘e Vii-mm

manee consisted of Beethoven's last
sonata, Opus Ill. It is a work of
overwhelming spaciousness which.
after a bravura opening movement.
settles into an ambiguous adsgio in
the form of a theme and variations.
Ennis‘ ' introductory remarks in-
dicated the otherworldly nature of
the work that Beethoven con-
structed. After a powerful opening,
and an excited and jazz-like 4th
variation the work drifted into this
ambiguous ﬁnal section where time.
space. and color blend together in a
form that suggested the tonic
developments of the later century.
The performance was. agaln.
superb. The opening Muestose
though a bit tenuous. was consistent
in its color and phrasing, but it was
the final Ariettu that shone. Paula
Ennis infused herself with the music.
conveying both personal and univer-
sal musical expression. It was a fine
studied work that fully earned the
audience's long applause.

success. However. as I result of mil;

information on 'Ann Beam. the

show itself was a grand disappoint-

ment. ‘.

, A promoter described ,Ms._Beatts
as an experienced comedian who
had performed often in nightclubs.

In accordance withthis information. 

Ms. Beatts was billed as acomedian.
In an interview after the show, Ms.
Beatts revealed that she had never
spoken in front of an audience
before. Moreover. she disclosed that
she had intended to speak as a lec-
turer. rather than as a comedian.
Ms. Beatts had hoped to use this
opportunity to publicize her new
book on women’s humor and to
seriously discuss consciousness rais-
ing for women in humor. Instead.
she quickly organized a series of
quotes and questions in an atte pt
to get some laughs. Ms. Beatts
replied to some of the negative feed-
back Iimply. “Don‘t boo or I‘ll cry."

She did not cry; in fact she laughed at
the situation.

For the most part. thoughpthe
audience was polite. it was neither
particularly receptive. nor aware of
the misunderstanding that had oc-

curred. In light of this lack of

knowledge. such a response is not
surprising for the jokes were trite
and the presentation was disorganiz-
ed. Ms. Beatts' composure underthe
circumstances was to be commend-
ed.

Ms. Beatts was preceded by
guitarist Artie Traum. His sonorous
music was well received. After some
minor delays with the sound equip-
ment, Artie Traum declared that “it

was just like playing at the Copa.”
Though he was unhappy with the
acoustics. Artie expressed approval
.of the new set-up in the Campus
Center ballroom. as opposed to the
more traditional one he found at his
last visit two years ago. ‘
Informal round tables replaced
the more structured aisles. Candles,
as well as the food and drink
available for a small fee. contributed
to the impression that the ballroom
had been transformed into a cozy
pub. rather than an auditorium.
I’aul Somner. chairperson of
Speaker‘s Forum had introduced the
idea. and was pleased with the
students‘ reaction to hiscxperiment.
