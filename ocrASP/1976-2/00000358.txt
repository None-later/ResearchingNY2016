The Colgate University Rugby
Team defeated their counterparts
from Albany State on Saturday by a
score of 94. Scoring began ten
minutes into the ﬁrst half as Albany
scrumback Bob Goldberg stripped
the ball from a Colgate defender and
romped fifty yards around end for
the try.

Goldberg missed the subsequent
conversion attempt after the long
run. and Albany led 4-0. Both teams
mounted offensive threats but
couldn‘t push the ball over the try
line. and the Albany lead stood at the
half, 4-0.

Second hall‘ penalties began to

plague Albany as the players com-
plained of the officiating. An offside
by Albany at their twenty yard line
resulted in Colgate‘s ﬁrst score. The
Colgate place kicker booted the ball
through the uprights for a three
pointer. but Colgate still trailed. 4-3.

Albany then moved the ball into
scoring position its their forwards
continued to overpower the Colgate
scrummcrs. Wing forward chccs
Rodriguez ran down to the try line
before being knocked out of bounds
at the corner marker.

Albany lined upl'ornthrow-inbut
a disputed call by the reform: in-
directly rcsulicd in the go-tihcud
score for Colgate. Colgate was

[taggers Nipped By  7 ,

awarded a drop kick at their 25-yard
line. and Albany was caught out of
position by the ensuing kick.

The boot landed deep in Albany
territory. and the Colgate backs
managed to run the ball over the try
line for the try. The conversion was
good. and Colgate took the lead. 9-4.
With ten minutes left in the game.
neither team could score, thus
yielding the final tally.

Evaluating the game. Co-Captain
Niall McStay commented.
“Everybody played strong. but
penalties hurt us, and Colgate
capitalized on all our mistakesI’The
Colgate captain remarked. “The
Albany scrum was very strong, and
