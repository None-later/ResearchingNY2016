Boaters Blankcd, 12-0
As Keene StateROlls

by Mike Piekarsltl .

“We weren't outplayed. but we
couldn't get. the ball in the net.“
That‘s the way it is when you are los-
ing. And soccer coach Bill
Schieffelin and company are. They
made it two losses in a row when they
travelled to Keene State and were
turned back 2-0, Saturday.‘

Coming off last week's 3-0 defeat
at the hands of Southern Illinois, the
Boaters have yet to score a goal this
year and may be starting to worry.

But Schieffelin is not worried.
“We play Oswego and Potsdam this
week and two wins will put us right
back in the ballgame. We‘re too
good not towin.” Keene Statethinks
otherwise.

The game began innocently
enough. Both teams came out fairly
cautious and looked for openings.
At 2:I5 of the ﬁrst half. Keene's
center forward Pete Ketcham found
one-in the left side of the Albany
State ‘net. “He was ten yards
we," "explained Dane teammate
Albert Giordano in defense of goalie
Dario Arango. who let it in.

It happened like this. Ketcham
was in Albany territory when he
came up with the ball and started to
drive in. He passed the ball ahead of
two defenders who were in front of
him. ran past them. and scored.

“They sloWed down because it was
an offsides." explained Giordano.
“The refjust didn‘t call it. When the
ball is passed up front and there are
defensive palyers betwoen the goalie
and the offense. that is offsides."

Albany argued vehemently but to
no avail. And Keene State led l-0
after the first half. It was a well-
played half. as both teams excelled
on defense and hustled on all fronts.

In the second half. the Boaters
came out rejuvenated. Attacking on

all points. the Danes seemed certain
to get the equalizer, And they'almost
had it. '

With about ﬁfteen minutes gone.
Chepe Ruano broke ahead of the
field and went in all alone on the
Keene State goalie. But his shot was
high and ended up sailing over the
net. No goal. .

A little later. defenseman Stanley
Gage was awarded a free kick from
about 35 yards out but adiving save
by the goalie thwarted that attempt.
And so it went; Albany keeping the
pressure on. and Keene State turning
them back every time.

The clincher came at 33:46 of the
second half. A‘Keene State shot was
stopped byAlbany goalie Arango.
but the ball bounced back. Doug
Shoron came up with the loose ball
and. with Arango screened out on
the play. kicked it into the right side
of the net to make it 2-0.

From there on. Albany began to
force the issue and did get control a
few times. but not well enough to put
the ball in the net. "The defense
played well." asserted Albany's Aldo
Sergovich. “and so did the midfield.
but the forwards just couldn‘t score.

“I thinkthat once we score the first
goal. we'll be all right. but they're all
thinking that ‘I‘ve got to score‘ and
they're just not moving well."

Schieffelin concurs. “We'll get
some goals this week; we'll be all
right. Even though we’re 0-2. we‘re
still ranked‘ninth in New York State.
It's an indication that we're highly
thought of—and of course we've
played two good ball clubs."

Oswego and I'otsdm

Tomorrow the Booters travel to
Oswego and return home on Satur~
daytoface Potsdam. It remains to be

seen if Schieffelin's optimism will be
borne out.

" in ct... Bell r
O For the ﬁrst time since l97l. when
Hudson Valley and Plattsburgh

turned the trick. the Albany Great

_ 'Danes football team dropped back-

to-back games as they were beaten
, by last year's Lambert Bowl winner
Ithaca College. 24-0 Saturday.

The game had to be frustrating for
Albany as the Danes' defense did not
yield a touchdown. For the second
consecutive week. the offense failed
to gel and State registered agoose egg
in the scoring column.

The last time an Albany team was
shut out in two successive weeks was
way back in I925 when they were
called the Pods and could manage

. but six points the whole year.
lthaca‘s first score came after the
‘Danes failed to move the ball on
' their first possession. Punter Mike
Marrin kicked the ball to Steve
‘ Tennenbaum who ﬁelded it on his
'own twenty-nine yard line. The
speedy junior broke out of the first
wave of tacklers. cut to his right. and
streaked 7I yards for the scdre. It
was the longest punt return in
Ithaca‘s history. Scott Billings added
.the point after and Ithaca had their
first points of the afternoon.
Costly Penaltles

The Danes tried to get something
going but costly penalties and two
first-half fumbles (one lost) stymied

any drive they managed to put
together.

The defense kept Albany in the
game for the entire ﬁrst half as they
consistently thwarted the Bombers'

Ne tters Win

by Edward Emerman

The Albany State men‘s tennis
team continued ’its winning ways
with three more victories last week.
improving its record to five wins and
no losses. Last Tuesday, the Danes
travelled to Rl’l and came away with
an 8-I victory. However. the match
was closer than the score indicated,
according to Albany coach Bob
Lewis.

Four of the six singles matches
went to three sets. Albany‘s top
player. Paul Feldman. was extended
to three sets by RPl‘s Tom Savehik.
After losing the ﬁrst set 7-6. Feld-
man came back strongly to win the
next two sets 6-3.,6—3.’

Also winning in three sets were se-

right on the doorstep. On a third and
goal from the three, lthaca quarter-
back Paul Morrissey rolled to his
right and appeared tube on his way
into'the endzone. but defensive end
Jim Dignan hurdled a blocker and
grabbed Morrissey before he could
turn the corner. The Danes went into
the lockerroom trailing 7-0.

The Danes' second half was
almost a carbon copy of the ﬁrst.
with the offense sputtering and the
defense holding on.

lthaca once again took advantage
of State's special teams to put some
points up on the board. This time
Tennenbaum fielded a punt on the
Albany forty-six and handed to
Dave Pitzer on a reverse. Pitzer out-
ran the pursuit as he raced down the
right sideline. The extra point was
good and lthaca led l4-0 midway
through the third quarter.

Only five minutes later. after pick-
ing off their second pass of the day,
the Bombers drove to the Danes’
seven. But now the defense stiffened
and lthaca had to settle for Billings‘
twenty-seven yard ﬁeld goal; the
only points the Ithaca offense would
put up on the board all afternoon
and the first they had scored all year.

On the ensuing set of downs.
Ithaca linebacker Pete Podlucky

picked off quarterback Brad
Aldridgc‘s pass and ran it in from the
twenty two. lthaca had just scored
seventeen points in five minutes. and
the way Albany was playing, there
would be no catching up.

Albanydid drive as close as the

Captain Dave Denny played in his
ﬁrst match of the season after sitting
out the ﬁrst two with an injured
ankle—teaming with Feldman in
doubles play. They defeated RPl‘s
number one doubles team of
Savchik and John O‘Neill. Coach
Lewis regards Denny us “the best
doubles player on the team."

Two days later. the Danes return-
ed home to play a tough Oneonta
tcum. Oneonta entered witha record
of two wins and no losses. But
Albany won the match 6-3. the
narrowest margin of the season.

The highlight of the contest was
the first singles match between Feld-
man and Paul Sommen of Oneonta.
It was a rematch of last year's ﬁnal at

but were set back by penalties on one
occasion, and halftime the other.

The Albany ground attack. led by
Tom DeBlois‘ forty-nine yards.
grounded out I79 yards but 106
yards in penalties more than offset
that. In addition. the Danes lost the

ball three times due to fumbles and
coughed it up four more times on in-
terceptions.

from the powerhouse they had been
last year. They are a young squad
and lack their customary offensive
punch, according to Coach Ford.
Ithaca had only seventy-nine more
total yards gained than State (28l-
202). but took advantage of Albany‘s
mistakes.

Varaity‘s Worst Start

Albany. 0-2. off to their worst
start since reaching varsity status in
I973. must now regroup and get
things right. They have a breather in
the schedule the next two weeks with
contests against Brockportand RIT;
teams they have outscored l53-30
over the lost two years.

Albany should be looking to beat
these teams with sound. crisp execu-
tion. something we have all come to
expect from the Danes. If they do
not get a consistent attack together.
then Cortland. Albright. Norwich.
and Springfield could make it a pret-
ty miserable year for Albany foot-
ball.

Game time for the game at
Brockport is l pm. and WSUA will
broadcast it live beginning at 1:25.

which Feldman won.

Feldman. describing his winning
game plan said. “The key to beating
Paul is serving well." He served ex-
tremely well and trounced Sommen

Snndler at second singles also
played well in defeating Jeff Rubin
6-3. 6-0.

One of the surprises on the team
has been the steady play of freshman
Matt Reich. He won his fourth
straight match without a loss. In an
exciting match. Reich - defeated
Mitch Cohen 7-6. 6-2. lnthe ﬁrst set.
Reich came buck from being down
four points to one in a best of nine
tiebreukcr and won it 5-4.

A national professors' association
is questioning the integrity of

The firing of faculty members

igency which cannot-be alleviated by

“these matters are left essentially to

no obligation to provide adequate
notice or to consult with the faculty

Declined Comment

Lapidus declined to comment on
any of the speciﬁc cases that are be-

Political Science Professor
Jonathon Knight. n spokesman for
the committee. said. "We believe

that the AAU I‘ can take an objective
view of this thing and cometo some
sort of judgement.“

One of the committee‘s primary
concerns is the bait of retrenchment.
“We objectstrcnuousiy to the goals
he [Fields] has set ‘and the means he
is using to achieve those goals." said
Knight. “You have a mission which
calls for rctrenchments.'if you stop
them. your game is up. Somebody‘s
got to go.“

Censure List

In at meeting yesterday with

Albany l’olicc Court where they face
a maximum sentence of fifteen days
in jail and it fine of one hundred

Dues Cover Debt

According to Tim Horton. vice
president of the Class of ‘78. this
year‘s class does willcovcr the $4.387
dcbt. “Our first report from the llur-
snr srrys Wc hove $2.000 and they‘ve
only tubulntcd one fourth of the
bills." suid Burton. Cinss dues

use $2.000 from each semester‘s dues
to pay the debts.“

Burton pluccs the responsibility of
the outstanding nroncy on the entire
council. “Wc didrr‘t think anything
was wrong. Any one of us could have
wulkcd to the controller's office [SA]
to find out what shape our account
was in.“

However. according to council
tncmbcr Normnn Schwartz. last
year‘s cluss‘treusurerJody Schocffcr
failed to keep a running account of
cluss expenditures and Benecke
neglected to obtain her signatures on
many vouchers.

very important that financial

Student Association President
Steve DiMco and the SA lawyer will
also accompany the students to
court. “1 think they‘ll get off." said
DiMco after yesterday‘s meeting
which was termed "positive" by all
involved.

l’rcsidcnt Fields. in an interview
on Wednesday. reflected upon his
actions taken during Monday's
demonstration. Fields defended his
decision to proceed with construc-

tion of the parking lot. “i can‘t see .

how dclttying construction to have
still another meeting with students
would have changed the outcome.
We had conducted meetings with
student leaders since Thursday rind
every time we reached it decision. the
students would ask for another dis-
cussion. We had a contract to
honor."

The contractor for the parking lot.
Capitol l’uvings. could have sued for
it“ the work time lost in the past
week. according to Vice President of
Business and Finance John. Hur-
tigun.

“We really don‘t know what
Would have happened had we
dcluycd another day. Obviously we
would be under speciﬁc penalties.
Whether or not the contractorwould
hch exercised his option for the
penalty is unknown. but he would
hrrvc been perfectly within his rights
to do so." suid Fields.

Among the protestors in the
demonstration to huult the building
of n parking lot on one tract of
Colonial Qurrd‘s recreational space
was DiMco. Of the twelve students
who continued to blockade the
bulldozer only DiMeo was not
urrested by officials of the Depart-
mcnt of Public Safety.

“As i understand it. the reason
Steve wasn‘t nrrcstcd was because he
was just further buck than the rest of
the students." explained Fields.
