A soon-to-be-released book is

between the Central Intelligence

The book. titled The Brothers

Reuthcr, 40-year veteran of the
Labor Movement and brother ofthe
United Auto Workers Union's
former president Walter Reuthcr. It
purports to document the extensive
history of the CIA and labor in
what Reuther calls a “solidarity of
subversion".

Reuthcr. during the early I950's,
worked for the AFL-ClOas ‘
director of the C I 0 's European of-
fice.

Reuthcr says that at that time he
worked in close quarters with the
3 — .AFL Europeant representative. Ir-

during that time. he found that
Brownaud the AFL were receiving
“incredibly large funds from some
U.S. government source in an effort
to get liuropcun trade unions in his
pocket and to dictate the foreign
policyof both European and African
countries".

GREAT ESCAPE

A convicted kidnappcr in
Melbourne. Australia. who was ser-
ving u Ill-year prison sentence. has
escaped while playing onthcjail golf
course. .

Embarrassed prison ofﬁcials
report that Robert Bnlnnd. who was

sentenced in 1972 on charges of kid- '

nuppingateachcr and six young girls
at gunpoint. slipped away from the
prison‘s nine-hole golf course which
is outside the prison walls.

Boland reportedly hooked a drive
into the left rough. went into the
bushes with his clubs to retrieve it.
and never returned to the fairway.

The police commissioner. who
arrested Bolund four years ago. said

angrily: “It‘s a great state of affairs if .

(this man) got away while playing
golf. My men do not have time to
play“. '

SWORN LIARS
The American Psychological
Association has been told that all re-

cent presidents of the United States '

have been extremely skillful at tell-
ing lies to the American people.

Cornell University psychologist "

Doctor Henry Alkcr says that a
detailed study of presidential
speeches has revealed that
“Presidents do know how to lie. and
very effectively."

Alkcr states that he used a ﬁve- ’

indicator index of what he calls

“mystification and deception" to 

measure the truthfulness of the

various presidents during key ad- 

dresses to‘ the American people.

He concludes that the five most re- ‘- I.

cent chief executivos were all very 

good liars.

The most truthful of all was 

Dwight Eisenhower. followed in
order by Lyndon Johnson. Gerald
Ford. John Kennedy, and. finally.

Nixon.
