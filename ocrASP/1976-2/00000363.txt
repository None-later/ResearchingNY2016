By JON R. HAND

The motion picture is a visual
medium with MOVEMENT. It can
employ movement 'within the frame
(misc-en-sccnc). movement outside
the frame (montage). movement of
whole scenes and sequences. and
movement of tile camera itself. This
movement can be static or dynamic.
active or passive. atlagio or ttl/cgro.

The ntotion picture director may
wish to create accurate rcprcsen-
tations of physical reality. or he can
do mttclt more. He can manipulate
reality to serve his own artistic goals
and itnposc subjective cx-
pressivcncss. And most important.
his search for more meaningful reali-
ty. transform time and space in any
or every fashion. In many ways.
therefore. the film artist is virtually
limitless in tile vision he wishes to

Within the narrative mode of.
cinema, the first directortoseriously
work with these visual possibilities
was D. W. Griffith. '

After the commercial success of
The Birth of a Nation, Griffith
poured all his creative energy (and
profits) into Intolerance (1915-16).
In a daring tut-mp! to present the
universal theme of intolerance
through the ages. Griffith intercuts
four different stories from different
periods of history with a symbolic
image of a woman rocking a cradle
recurring throughout to unite the
separate episodes. The result: a
screenplay. at times excessive and
too complex. at other times. horribly
simplistic. The idea is simply too
broad and vague. and the four plots
do ttot clcttrly dcvelopin aconsistcnt
manner.

Despite the problematic narrative.
however, Intolerance is a very im-
portant iiim_. Griffith's expcimetttr

cinematic form. All Grifﬁthgitnew 

about the medium was incorporated
into this silent Citizen Kane. Three
years later. Soviet directors would
stand in awe at the film’s monumen-
tal composition.

Griffith‘s discovery of the primary
element of film structure. the shot.
reaches an unprecedented height in
Intolerance. Not only is there on im-
portant use of parallel action and
cross-cutting unifying the four
stories. but within the sequences
Griffith clearly wants us to notice his

I use ofthc shot; Duringthe climax of

the film. the construction and
rhythm foreshadowthc montage of
I’udovkin and Eisenstein. In the
episode where the boy mounts the
gallows, we are first given it longshot
of the entire area. Reaching the top.
Griffith cuts to a medium shot in
order for us to see the guards tieing
his ankles. Still wishing to improve
the viewpoint and keep the scene

‘ cinematically interesting. Griffith

cuts to a closer medium shot. We
now begin to see body movements
and facial expressions; the boy leans
toward the camera. Finally. Griffith
cuts to a close-up of the boy‘s
anguishcd face; he stares and
Itaggcrs backward and forward into
the camera plane.

The editing construct is complete:
four different shots within ten
seconds of the film. The filmmaker
has destroyed the spacial reality and
cincmaticttliy recreated it for his ar~
tistic purpose.

and the protagonistsjump into a car
which chases hurridly out of the

sion at the prison: the camera tracks
back with the procession as the priest
I'aulters and his prayer book drops.
Suddenly. from nowhcrc. appears an

Griffith did much to improve the
art oi'iilm. Besides his brilliant use of
the shot and its juxtaposition
(editing). he developed a sense for
picturinl design. which until Griff ith,
was practically non-existent. He also
created a different kind of acting.
more naturalistic in character. es-
pecially suitablc for cinema. The use
of dramatic and imaginative lighting
is also due to Griffith's insistence on
improving the textual quality of his
images. And finally. of course. he
gave us proof of the power of the
close-up. a tool of film expression’
which has since been used by nearly
every great motion picturc‘ director.

For Griffith. the years following In-
tolerance were not as fruitful as his
earlier ones. Except for a few
productions like Broken Blossoms.
Way Down Eat! and Orphans of the
Storm, Grifﬁth's twenties films are
ttot very interesting. He had lost
touch with the medium. Mttch
tcpetition and exaggeration occurs
in his later work. More of a loss to
the medium. however. was tltc
decline of his cut'licr style; it had lost
much of its controlch discipline.
The compositions bccttmc in-
creasingly awkward uttd careless
with weak cditing constructions.
Never again did Griffith‘s work
reach the excellence of tile 1914—16
masterpieces.

liut Griffith‘s work preaches
tolcrttncc. ttnd we too must be
tolerant of his decline in the light of
his great contributions. ch film-
mttkcrs‘ work attains the level of
Griffith‘s art. And no other director.
with the exception of Eisenstein. has
discovered more about the language
of cinema as an art form.
