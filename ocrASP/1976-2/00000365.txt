.Anesent biographers. writing to
moralizeo'r to_entertain rather than
’to history, often allowed their
imag’natiott to take over where,the
availablelnformation left off. They
- readily ‘_ invented stories of
' misaliulotts conception. birth, ‘or
childhood exploits. Similarly they
were not Inclined to let famous
peopledie tamely in bed. Stories of
gruesome. quaint, melodramatic. or
ridiculous deaths abound. some of
them perhaps invented by comic
poets. Greek poets and philosophers
provide numerotu examples.

The epic poet Hesiod reportedly
repaid the hospitality of two
brothers by seducing their sister.
whereupon his hosts murdered him
and threw his brdy into the sea.
Dolphins. however. returned the
body to shore, and the local nymphs
tenderly saw to a proper burial.

Three lyric poets of the sixth
century fared no better. Of Sappho
we are to believe that she cast herself
offa rock intothe sea. being lovesick
for acertain Phaon. Anacreon. often
maligned as a libertine and a
drunkard. supposedly died when a
grape seed lodged in his throat. of
lbycus it is said that some robbers
fell upon him in a deserted place.
Just before they killed him he cried
out that the cranes passingover
would avenge him. The robbers
returned to the city and very shortly
saw some cranes flying overhead.
“Look. the avengers of lbycus.“thcy
jested. They were overheard.
reported. tried. and executed.
Students of German may know
Friedrich Schiller‘s ballad of the

story.
The philosopher Heraclitus. we
are told. tried to cure himself of a
particular disease by covering
himself with manure; he failed.
Empedocles was not only a poet and
a philosopher but also a religious
charlatan. He believed in
Pythagoras‘ doctrine of the
trammigration of souls and claimed
to remember previous lives. Upon
his death his followers'claimed that
he had been taken up to heaven.
Someone even claimed to know that
Empedocles had jumped into the
crater of Mount Etna. in order to
give the impression of having been
taken up to heaven. but that the
volcano ruined his scheme by
spewing up one of his bronze (l)
sandals. The story of Anaxagoras is
really more attractive. He was
invited to Athens and paid a regular
allowance by Pericles. Once Pericles
forgot. and Anaxagoras. too proud
to ask for it. calmly lay down to die.
Fortunately someone reminded
Pericles just in time to save the
philosopher. Some years later.
Anazagoras was required to leave
Athens and took up residence at
Lampsacus. where he died in 428
B.C. (these are facts). When he was
on his deathbed — and now one
wonders again —— the city council
inquired what kind of memorial he
wanted for himself. He requested
that the day of his death he made an
annual holiday for the
schoolchildren of the city.
Furthermore. Dionysus. the god
of the theater. commanded

You could buy an apple from one
ofthe on-campus vendinglmachines
for thirty cents. Or you can go to the
Barbershop Food Co-op. located in
the Campus Center basement next to
the shin shop. and purchase one for
seven pennies.

Since its inception last February
when it replaced the barbershop
(hence its name). the Co-op has
enabled students and others of the
university community to buy food at
prices cheaper than those at most
retail establishments.

Robyn Perchik. Membership
Coordinator and head of the
Counter Committee. said “We're
trying to provide healthy foods at
cheap prices. Presently. we carry
fresh fruits and vegetables. a wide
variety of canned goods. dairy

“We're planning on stocking fresh
meats for our members.” she con-
tinued. “and adding to the variety of
items we stock."

Members purchase food at cost.
while non-members are charged a
fifteen per cent markup. This
markup pays for overhead and
operating expenses. and allows for
expansion of stock.

All members must pay dues: three
dollars per semester. or ﬁve dollars

Shelley Julibcr. a member of the
Steering Committee. said “We have
certain problems—for example. we
occasionally run out of particular
items. This is due to the limited
amount of storage and refrigerator
space. and the fact that we can't get
goods delivered every day of the
week."

Ms. Juliber indicated that the
Steering Committee was looking
into the possibility of increasing the
number of deliveries each week. in
order to replenish stock without
delay.

Student Association President
Steve DiMeosaidthut he was pleas-
ed with the Co-op‘s operations. He
added that he was interested in ex-
panding the Co—op to provide a
greater variety of items.

The most logical location for ex-
