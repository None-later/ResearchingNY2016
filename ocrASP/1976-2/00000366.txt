' To the Erltor:

0n the afternoon of Monday, September

I 20th. eleven’ students from Colonial Quad

were arrested for disorderly conduct. We are
those eleven. We would like everyone to know
why we were willing to go so far to stand up for
what we believed in.

To begin with. we were aware of the fact
that the Colonial Pay Parking Lot issue was
already non-negotiable, but we also knewthat
backing down at the moment of contfronta-
tion would nullify the stand We had taken for
the past week.

As our message to all University students.
we hopethat you will insist upon student input
in all adminstrative decisions that affect you.
And students of Dutch and State quads
should realize that it is not too late to make
their wishes known regarding the parking lots
that are proposed to be built on Iltt‘ir quads.

We hold no grudges against those who were
unable to make this final commitment. Many
of these people sat day after day and did as
much. if not more than we did.

When people feel that their personal prin~
ciples are more important than civil
obedience. they have an obligation to accept
the consequences 'of disobedience.

This is why Wt: did what we did. We are not
martyrs or glory~seekers. We are merely
students, like yourselves. who did what we
thought was right.

To the Editor:

The issue of whether or not the Colonial
Quad parking lotshould be built is over. What
i would like to discuss is our student represen-
tation in the matter. First: I would like to
thank Steve DiMeo. He didn‘t have much
hope for victory. but he stuck by the protestors
all the way.

Our central Council Representative.
Michael Lissrter. is a different case entirely. !
was involved in the Monday morning meeting
with the Administration where Michael was
one of the peoplewhototd the Administration
Reps that. if certain promises they had tnude
were written out and signed by the vice-
prcsident. the students would probably be
satisﬁed. After we received this letter, Michael
told me personally that he was behind it 100%.
This was in the hearing range of other strident
representatives. Michael said that he would go
out and try to sell it to the students.

Therefore. try to imagine my surprise when
Michael told these students that the Ad-
ministration had notdoncenough. and that he
Wlonally would stay out the rest of the day
with the protesters. and be arrested himself is
“W1 be. I have one question: Where was
Michael when the arrests were made?! believe
that he was most conspicuous by his absence.

This letter is in response to one which
appeared in Tuesday’s ASP. We would like to
thank the Student insurance Ofﬁce for their
interest in Five Quad, but regret that the infor-
mation contained therein was incomplete.
Five Quad offers its services to all students.
faculty, staff. and visitors while all of the
above are present on campus or in the
Welling/on. Five Quad only covers students,
faculty. staff and their immediate families
when ofl'the above premises [/ t hey are within
a five/mile radius of our base on State Quad
omlthey are in an area which is not covered by
another volunteer corps. We are the only
volunteer corps which is operating in the city
ofAlbany. so that the above people (most stu-

dent apartments are within city limits) cortre~

Class of ’78
continues

To the Editor:

in regards to the article in last Tuesday's
ASP, “Parties Put Class of '78 in Red", we
would like to fully explain the situation as it
presently stands. Last Tuesday night. the
Class of ‘78 Council met. First and foremost
on the agenda was the deﬁcit. Since no
member of the ASP attended the meeting.
although an invitation was extended. we feltit
necessary to convey the results of that
meeting.

l’resident Marc Benecke has been relieved
of all financial power. control, and signing
rights to vouchers. We have rearranged out in-
ternal structure to safeguard against any more
budget deficits. We created a four-person

financial committee to oversee the books and

payments of the class.

The deﬁcit was mostlythe fault of last year's
Class Council members and SA's faulty con-
trolling practices. Although the deficit is very
close to the amount specified in the article
($4.387). there is no reason why the class
should not be solvent withittthc year. With the
lteip and cooperation ofthe Student Activities
Office. plans are being tnadc to off-set the
balance against this semester‘s and next
semester's dues. The ntnount of the deficit
does not reflect monies paid over the summer
for this semester. lfeverything works out ac-
cording to the initial arrangements. this would
leave us with an operating budget for each
semester.

While the council realizes that it alone cannot
fund parties on the settle we have in the past. it
is our sincere desire to remainin existence. We
will continue to program activities that will be
of interest to the University Community.

With the cooperation of the new and old
Class Council members ttnd the Junior Class
as a whole. we see no reason why we can‘t re-
main one of the more active programming
groups on campus.

The candidates each believed that they had the cure-itoA-mc h . , I

 

In fact neither do. Both men spoke of an increase in' industrial produc-
tivity to reduce unemployment, neither attempted to‘explain sway the
resulting increased energy demands and envirotunental destruction.
Both sought to relieve the tax burden of “middle” Americans, but
neither adequately spoke of the loss of vital services this would
engender. Certainly, concrete solutions are difﬁcult; none were provid-
ed.

How then do voters measure the merits of one candidate over the
other? is it enough to study the positions of each man and weigh the
chances of converting these proposals into action? Perhaps voters may
gain insights into the character of these men by scanning their responses
under the pressure of millions of staringeyes. For, if nothingelse, these
debatesudcmonstrate that the choice of a president 'is not just the
weighing of a neat bundle of proposals.

Concerned voters will try to choose a man of intelligence and honesty;
full of righteous resolve and calm resourcefulness. As in most elections.
Americans must settle for less. They watch these debates and search for
clues.
