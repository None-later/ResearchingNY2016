Lt. Al Cisneros of Brownsville, Texas is a Naval Aviator (Pilot). He
made it because he has what it takes. If you think you‘ve got it, then
we want you. ' > ' . _

First of all, you don't have to know how to ﬂy to begin training
with our Navy air team. We start you frontthe ground up. It’s deman-
ding, rugged. but when you take your ﬁrst solo, you‘ll'know it's worth
it. ' ‘ - - . .

Think: about it. You'll find out the Naval Aviator is a special breed
of cat.

jut got to regroup and get back touther. lstill think we have the capability
of being a good ball club. but I can‘t go too many more weeks saying that."
And Sehieﬂ'elln has virtually promised two quick victories. “Two wins this

exo‘ting soccer this week." . .

Dy thiatime, the Boaters will have already played Oswego en route to
“up. Potsdam tomorrow. The football team will be in Broekport tor a
.uppoaedly “euy” game. But enough talk. All the writing in the world will
not put points up on the board; the players have to do it themselves. These
m are good. and they probably will have good seasons once they snap out
of their doldntma. But if they don't produce. and produce soon, the fans are
