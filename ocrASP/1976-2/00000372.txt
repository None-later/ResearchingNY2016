TUNE THIEF

Former Beatle George Harrison
has been found guilty of plagiarizing
thetune he used for his hitaong“My
Sweet Lord.“

A Federal Court in New York has
ruled that Harrison based his I970
song on a 1963 tune called “He‘sSo
Fine". popularized by the Chiffons.

Harrison had contended in court
that the similarity between the two
tunes—ii" there was any similarity—
was purely coincidental. He
acknowledged that he had heard the
earlier tune. but insisted he wrote
“My Scht Lord" starting from
scratch.

However. US District Judge
Richard Owen has ruled that “He‘s
So Fine" and “My Sweet Lord“ are
“The very same song“. Judge Owen
suggested Harrision may have

remembered the old tune “aub-
consciously” when he wrote “My
Sweet Lord." '

The judge said he would rule on
November 8th as towhat damages. if
any. George must pay to the original
owners ot'the tune. '
