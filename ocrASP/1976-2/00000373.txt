To the Editor:

When I was in elementary school, I wanted
to be tn the sixth grade. Then i could wear a
white stripe across my chest and stop the cars
on Denton Avenue with a mere wave of my
safety patrol'badge; even if I was the fourth
smallest in the class (I lined up behind Charlie
Crupettu—Charlic couldn‘t reach the urinal.
so he sat). I still could be B.M.O.C. ifl could
just be in sixth grade and onthc sufcty patrol.

To be on safety putrol was really special.
Someone on safety patrol httd transcended the
world of bicycles ttnd at lunch tttlkcd of girls
httving their "p—cc-ri-uds“. Sitfctyputrollcrs
did their job with it ccrtttin air of up-
pcrclossman maturity; perhaps they were con-
stantly aware thut the lives of its mttny its one
hundred strcct-crosscrs lay in their hands.

But I grow. and the "cookies" in my shocs
(the left one cspcciully) bcgttn to fall off
without my mother knowing. ttnd the magic of
being upside down on the monkey bitrs
diminished (or was I right side tip ttnd the
school upside down like I used to mllkc
believe), and I didn't lllllt.‘ girls so muclt tlh‘ I
used to. ttnd l begun to rcttlizc llllll most pco-
plc hud their science fair projects done bytltcir
l'ttthcrs. The sufety ptttrol lost its ttllurc ttlottg
the way. In fact. when I did l‘inully rcuclt thc
sixth grttdc ttnd wusn‘t clcctcd to the Sttl‘tcy
l’ttlrol (I got u "U“ in “keeps school property
ticttt“). it didn't really bother me. I wanted to
be in seventh grttdc by then . . . ttnd sixth
grztdc was like clitnhing tltc lust rung of it
lllddL‘l‘ when you paint it wull. The time cotncs
to be finished tilrcudy. ttnd you never rcttlly
cvcr feel like doing the molding on top.

This ansWers Mr. Scherbenlto's charge
about SA funds and we suppose our letter

commence. allow his accusations against
Israel to go unanswered.
“ While it is true that. unfortunately. Israel,
has been tn wars with its neighbors”, the
question thttt must be asked is. who
precipitated those wars? The correct answer is
that it was the Arubstates inthe Mid-East who
were the aggressors. To blume Israel for
fighting back for her life is like blaming the
Allies in World War II for ﬁghting to end
Hitler's reign of terror.

Contrary to what Tom believes, Israel does
not "shoot down innocent refugees in retalia-
tion for terrorist activities or United Nations
votes which didn‘t gothcir way". Those “inno-
ccnt" rcfugcc camps ttrc not so innocent; they

Endth The Overspendtng  

Student Association has tried to compel its groups to scrutinize their
budgets closely in order to avoid overspending. so far they have not
been successful. “ ' r ’ ' " 

Attempting to resolve the recent. personal liability Controversy, SA
revamped its ﬁnance policy last week. Finance Committee Chairman
Rich Greenberg said the new policy will better enable the SA Controller
to monitor groupit' budgetsz'Concentrating on the controller as the
overseer of group spending sounds like a step in the right direction.

The SA Controller has the resources and the authority to prevent a
group from spending itself into the red. An alert Controller will see to it
that no group exceeds its budget. if the Controller doesn’t do that,
then he isn’t doing his job.

Failings Of The Oversperit

Meanwhile. SUNYA‘s Class of ’78 has done exactly what SA is trying
to prevent groups from doing —— it overspent its budget. SA has no
control over class finances, since classes are not SA-funded, so it cannot
be held accountable for the Class of "78‘s $4.387 bungle. However, the
management of the Class of ‘78 can be cited as the guilty party.

The group's president stated that excessive spending is behind the
group‘s unfortunate financial calamity. That‘s obvious. The important
question is ,what was behind the group‘s excessive spending? The Class
of ’78 could have, and should have, kept its books up to date and cut
down on spending when its budget began sinking into the red. But it did
not.

A lot of extravagant parties were a product of the group's
overs pending; it is evident that incompetence and mismanagement were
the cause of it.

The Class of '78 president said the students felt they were getting their
money‘s worth. That was an understatement. They were getting more
than their money's worth - about four thousand dollars more.
