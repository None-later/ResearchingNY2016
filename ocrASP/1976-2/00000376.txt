-Insome sports, such as basketball

'how many former varsity letter

“II we could jut ran topther, we

Albany did run well toulnr in
the beﬁtting. At the quarter-mile
mark. a sea (1 gold utifotms paced
the field. It: Albany fell way book
by the end. The lat six puitionl—
twemy-seven through thirty-two—

Results were below expectation.
“I hope to improve last year's time
[of about 27.I0]. I'm in better
shape." Junior Torn Ryan had said
before the meet. He ran 27.48.
Senior Phil Sullivan felt a group of
Albany barriers “should be under 27
if things go right.“ Plagued by scold
and a knee injury, Sullivan himself
ran 28.20. while only twoteammates
broke 27 ﬂat.

Seniors Chris Burns again paced
the Albany runners this week,
ﬁnishing fifth in 25.45. Yet. to
Albany coach Keith Munsey, who
had hoped for a better performance
from Burns, even this was a let-
down. “Chris didn't have it in his leg
today." said Mumey. “Lucky he
showed up. though. otherwise we'd
have been shut out.

“It was a good meet and a
beautiful day.” continued the dis-
pirited Albany coach. “Unfonunaten

low on his team's prospects: “We're
gonna get whacked by the good
