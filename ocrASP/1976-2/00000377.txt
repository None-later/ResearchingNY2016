It mt target precise; Butthls
time, time ‘ofthesho’ts went in With
an incredible 77 shots at goal. the
Albany-varsity soccer team wiped
out a gritty Potsdam squad by a
score of‘7-l'at the Albany'socser
ﬁeld Saturday. thus breaking their
scoring famine. ‘

And "for coach ' William
Schieffelin, it was the first victory of
the season. “We started being
aggressive today. I hope this is going
to be the beginning of our momen-
tum. Even with a 2-0 lead at the
half." continued Schieffclin. “I was
uncomfortable; Those guys
[Potsdam] hustle."

But even with Potsdam's hustle
and the excellent play of Bears'
goalie Dan Nistilo—the score would
have been much larger witnout his
diving saves—the Hooters were not

to be denied this‘ day.

      

Coming off a frustrating I g
oswego on Wednesday, Albany had
no wins until Potsdam. In fact. they
had not scared until right halfback
Matty Denora tallied in the second
half of the 'Oswego contest to send
the game into overtime. Two ten
minute overtime periods produced
ho more scoring. and Albany had to
settle for the deadlock. L

With all the missed shots in that
one. it was very similarto Saturday's
contest. Schieffelin explained: “At
Oswego. we had maybe ten shots like
we had today and they just weren’t
going in. When they go. they go; and
when they don‘t. they don't."
Against Potsdam they did—some of
them—and against Oswego they
didn't. ‘

And although Albany did score
seven goals on Saturday, it was not

Batters Split in Classic

by Jerry Gray

When the last game of this year‘s
baseball Fall Classic came to a close,
everyone expected one winner and
one loser. Instead. there were co-
champions as neither Westfield
State nor Siena College could
manage a run to break a one-one tie
before darkness fell over University
field. The tournament, co-hosted by
Albany and Siena. was divided into
two brackets with games being,
played on Friday and Saturday.

Albany State was eliminated early
in the tournament. losing to North
Adams State on Friday. However.
the weekend did not turn out to be a
total loss. as the Danes bounced
back to win an exciting consolation
game against Adelphi 7-6, Saturday.

In the opening loss on Friday. it
was a matter of too littletoo late. as
North Adams jumped out to an early
4-0 lead with two runs each in the
first and third innings. The Great
Danes had enough opportunities to
score in the middle innings, but
could not capitalize on them.-

The best chance for a big inning
came in the fourth. when Albany
loaded the bases with a one-out
single by Jim Willoughby and two
infield errors. But nothing came of it
as Marty Riecio hit into an inning-
ending double play.

The Danes ﬁnally managed two
runs in the sixth inning. when with

   
 

two outs. Chris Siegler scored from
third base when a ground ball got by
the North Adams second baseman.
Riccio then followed with an rbi
single to close out the Albany scor-
ing. North Adams came back with
two runs in the seventh on a hit~and-
run single to right that eluded the
right-ﬁelder and a well executed
suicide squeeze.

In the consolation game win over
Adeiphi. Albany again got behind
early. but this time took advantage
of its opportunities to gain a come-
from-behind victory. The biginning
came in the fifth when the Danes
took the lead 7-5. on three runs with
only two hits. Three passed balls
charged to the Adelphi catcher. as
well as three walks aided the cause.

Hittingstars included Roger Plan-
tier and Richard Cardillo. who each
collected two rbi's. while Chris
Siegler scored three times. Howie
Markowitz also contributed to each
State rally with two singles and a
walk.

Panasaos Hulk No-Hltter

As for the rest of the tourney. two
Westlield pitchers shone. Mark Pan-
assos pitched a no-hitter on Friday
enabling the Owls to. pull off a 2-i
upset win over favored Ithaca. And
then Butch Lamagdelaine turned in
a dazzling twelve inningstint against
Siena on Saturday giving Westﬁeld
the share of the Fall Classic title.

really very much. When one realizes
that only ten per cent of the shots
taken actually found the net. it is evi-
dent that Albany has been having its
problems this season.

The first goal came at MD of the
first half. Outside linebacker Chepe
Ruano, with an assist from Jory
Aguilar. came up with the ball about
eight yards in front of the net. and
blasted it by Nistilo.

The second came at 29:07 as
Denora scored to Nistilo‘s right offa
rebound. Nistilo had made a sliding
save only a moment earlier and was
out of position when the goal was
recorded.

In between those two tallies.
Nistilo was making more saves than
some relief pitchers make in a
lifetime. Following Ruano's goal,
Denora had two good scoring
chances—reithcr right at Nistilo or
over the net—and failed to convert.
Paul Schiescl then took over the
shot-taking and blasted four hot
ones within a period of two and a
half minutes—all missing.

After that. it was Pasquale Pettic-
cione. Edgar Martinez. Johnny
Rolando, and Frank Selca; all with
golden oppurtunitics. none with
results. Albany was completely
dominating play. keeping the ball in
Potsdam‘s zone almost the entire
half andjust hammering away at the
net. But most ofthe shots sailed over

Gridders Maul Brockport, 37 -3

by Michael Smith

Quick. Name some of those awful
cliches you hear on TV every Sunday
that describe a team which must win
a certain ballgame orelse'start think-
ing about next year.

“Backs to the wall"——good. “Nail
in the coffin"——o.k. “No
tomorrow"—keep going. “Do or
die"—yes. Let me help you out. How
about "Crucial". “Pivotal”, “Must
'win" and “Turning point”.

They all may becorny, but Satur-
day's football game between Albany
State and Brockport State meant all
of those cliches and more to Coach
Bob Ford and his Great Danes.

They had to have it.

And they got it.

Final score:
Brockport, 3.

Hurray for our side.

The score may sound pretty one-
sided but the game itself was won
hard.

In the first halfthc Albany offense
ran like Ll well-greased machine. The
Danes chewed up yardage. pushed
the Eagles around. sent Tom
DeBiois up. under. around and
through the line—and then it
happened—-time after time. Albany
made mistakes that kept Brockport
close.

“We made a lot of bonehead plays
In the first half that cost us a lot of
points." Ford said. “You name it.
penalty. bad play. fumble. blown
assignment—we did it all."

If it wasn‘t for all the goofs. Ford's
club Would have captured the city of
Rochester and taken all prisoners by
halftime. As it was. the Danes settled
for a 6-3 lead before the marching
bands took over. The margin was
Tom Delllois' one-yard plunge over
a Brockport field goal by Tom
(irable.

“By halftlme. we had committed
enough mistakes to be behind by a

Albany. 37;

whole lot against a team like Ithaca."
the coach said. “Ith had to remind
our people Brockport had just tied
Alfred. If we wanted to win we had
to take it to them."

Take it to them the Danes did.
How Albany put the points on the
board is a story in itself.

Enter Dave Ahonen—ex~quarter-
back. now halfback. All Dave did
was run likeO..l. Simpsoneverytime
he had the opportunity. Ahonen
made 99 yards onjust three carries.
Such is the stuff Heisman Trophy
winners are made of.

One of Ahonen‘s three tries was a
59-yard run that signaled the begin-
ning of the end for the home team.
Three plays later. golden-haired
Brad Aldrich. the guy with the up-
till-now. not-so-goldcn arm. ﬁnessed
a thrce<ynrd touchdown pass to
another unlikely hero. freshman
Lynn Pinkston. and the Danes were
up. l3-3.

Brcwlngton Takes Charge

At that point Fred Brewington'

took charge. "Brew" is considered by
the coaching staff to be the finest
pa'sscr of the trio. and Saturday he
didn't disappoint.

On the series following Aldrich‘s
throw. llrew dropped back near mid-
field und hit split end Mike Voliton
on his way to the end zone. 'I‘wo
touchdown passes in one quarter by
Albany State-7 is the sky falling?

“We are not the type of team that
could make a living by putting the
ball in the air." Ford said. "But when
we can run like we did on Saturday.
the defense is set up perfectly for a
play-action puss. After that. it's as
easy as executing the play."

To score. of course. your offense
has to have the football. Uettingthe
football for your offense is thejob of
the defense. The guys in charge of
making life miserable for the
Brockport offense were led by tackle

Marty Thompson and backs Ilill
Brown and Bill Allison.

“Those three led the charge." said
the coach. “Iiut they had lots of help.
We were very aggressive on defense
in the second half. There was a lot of
gang-tackling going on out there.
And a coach likes nothing better.“

When the fourth quarter rolled
around. most ofthe starters were on
the bench thinking ahead to R.l.'|‘.
next week. The guys on the playing
field. meanwhile. were thinking
about scoring some more points.

Larry Leibowitr. got things started
with a 35-yard field goal after the
Danes were stopped short of the goal
line by a penalty.

Then it was time for some new
faces to show their stuff.

Freshman Sam Halstion ran to
daylight on a 42-yard quick opener.
the defense got the ball back. and
Kevin Klein became the fifth
different Albany player to score
when he ran 20 yards. That closed
out the scoring at 37-3. and there was
no joy in lirot .tport.

The post-game arithmetic showed
the Danes running up 479 yards in
total offense; 358 yards rushing. l21
yards passing. a new school record
for most yards through the air for
Albany quarterbacks.

The juggling of positions seemed
to be spark the Danes needed on
offense. “We'll keep everybody
guessing as long as we have the per-
sonnel to do it." said Ford. “But as
good as our backs are. it's our offen-
sive line that makes us go. They're
small and they're not so quick; they
just get the job done."

And thut'sjust what Albany State '

football tcatn‘to a man——did on
Saturday; get thejob done. But then.
they had to. Because. the Dunes'
bricks were against the wall...there
was no tomorrow...it was a crucial
game...

 

 

  
    
  
   
    
  
    
  
    
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
   
   
 
  
  
   
 
 
 

   
 
  
    
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 

. revocation of its student government

‘ by Paid Rosenthal

The Student Organizing Project. a
group designed to provide an “ex-
amination of the educational
processes at SUNYA." has averted

recognition;

Central Council. at its regular
Wednesday night meeting. rejected
SA President Steve DiMeo‘s
proposal for ending official sanction
for SOP.

DiMco reminded the Council that .
he had opposed recognition for the
group from the outset because he felt
“SOP would circumvent the role of
what Student Association should
already be providing.“

The group‘s organizers. Harvey
Luft and Joe Dicker. then went to
Central Council. which granted SA
recognition. Dickcr has since resign-
ed from SOP.

Much of the controversary sur-
rounding the organization stems
l'rom a demonstration organized to

   

SUNVA Presldent Emmett B. F

protest the arrests of eleven students
at the Colonial Quad parkinglot sit-
in. DiMeo said the arrested students
"were very much upset” about the
SOP protest because they were not

informed of the action in advance.

Council Chairperson Greg Lessne
agreed that the Colonial eleven
desired to make clear that they had
no involvement in the SOP
demonstration. He added that the
group was “detracting from the
credibility of Student Association.“

SOI’ Coordinator Bob Cohen
pointed out the issue was “not
whether it adhered to its own con-
stitution.

The group‘s charter states SOP is
to discuss education an SUNYA
"with the express intention of foster-
ing and enhancing the organization
of a democratic union of students.“

Council members discussed what
rights SA has tocontrol the activities
of its groups. Dutch Quad Council

Representative Rich Weiss said. “I

SUN YA Lighting Inadequate For Safety

by Susan E. Miller

“Women should be afraid to walk
alone on this campus at night." ac-
cording to Teri H ol brook. ll member
of the Albany County Rape Crisis
Center.

Holbrook cites inadequate ex-
terior lighting, isolated area and lack
of patrol as reasons why the SUNYA
campus is unsafe after dark.

  

In the wake of an attempted rape
outside of Colonial Quad on
September 13 and a rape on Fuller
Road on September l5 there is a ris-
ingconcern onthe part of students as
to the safety of this campus.

“People think this is a new

problem. It is not. 'l‘wowomcn final-

don‘t think we‘re within our rights in

denying an organization‘s right to
protest.“ Weiss added that SA
“doesn‘t have the right to make them
[SOP] go underground.“

Commuter Representative David
Weprin said. “They want to work
with Strident Association and they
have. They have become a recogniz-
ed group."

DiMco told the SOI’ members
that he and Central Council. being
elected officials. should be the in-
dividuals working on behalf of
students. Ilc suggested that SOP
members might be able to work
more effectively within the student
government.

Lessne suggested that if SA
recognition was revoked. the group
could seek university sanction.
enabling it to make use of campus
facilities.

The motion to revoke S()l"s
recognition failed by a vote of 4 to

Houston Plan Resembles Mission

by Spence Raggio

A front page article in ’l‘hursdoy's
‘l‘imes-Union called attention to the
similarity of parts of President
Emmett Ficlds' “Mission State-
ment" for SUNYA to the U niversity
of Houston‘s “Mission Self-Study“

 published last year.
" “It‘s no secret." said assistant to

the president Robert Shirley. who
worked with Fields on the Houston
study before moving to Albany last
year.

The Houston report was made
available well before the publication
of Fields' study. and. according to
Shirley. no attempt was made to

Inadequate lighting at night has
become a major concern at SUNYA.

According to Frank Kopf. Direc—

conceal the fact that the general.

philosophical sections of the

Houston report would be used in
SUN YA‘s mission study.

“[The duplicated sections] are the
elements of the mission we share
with universities everywhere."
Shirley said. “We should all have the
some objectives for strident develop-
ment."

The sections of I‘iclds' mission
statement in question are “Part III:
Goals and Objectives for Strident
Development.“ and “Part IV: (ioztls
and Objectives for Societal Develop—
ment.“

Much has been borrowed ver-

responsc to the energy crisis and the
state's financial crisis.

said. “We must make a decision that
lights go out at 2:30 ll.m. It is not
necessary lor most people to be out
that late."

Kopl l'cilll/L‘S that the reduced
lighting makes many areas very
dark. He explained. “ When we cur—
tuilcd lighting. we knew people
uould have to walk through poorly
lit areas."

James Williams. Director of the
Department ol Public Safety at
SUN YA said. “Even when we had all
the lights turned on. it wasn‘t well
enough lit to suit me or my officers."
Williams has recommended that the
lighting be increased.

In the lull ol I975 when the deci-
sion was made to reduce lighting,
Kopl said. "The uptightness and
fears of l'cnntle students was not even
a factor." Ilc said that the main con-
cern was for thefts and vandalism.

Kopl‘ understands the "uncomfor-
table fccling of females on Ctltl‘lpuh‘."
and is willing to work with groups in
order to improve the lighting situa-

tion. ' .
He said he wtll restudy the situa-
camlnucd (m page/our

e

banim from the corresponding sec-
tions of Houston's “Mission Self-
Study.“ although it has been edited
and rewritten in part for specific
application to SUNYA‘s mission.

Specific recommendations in
regard to academic ,.and_..ud-
ministrative priorities on the
SUNYA campus were not derived
lrom the Houston study.’ Sections
dealing with SUNYA‘s history and
its role as a university center also
hear no direct similarity to the
Houston report.

l’rcsidcnt l-ields‘ Mission Study is
a proposal: it is tentative and has
been widely distributed for reaction
and response.

The Houston statement is a
finalized document containing
detailed plans for implementation.

Although Fields did serve on the
Zl-membcr steering committee that
produced the Houston report. as did
Shirley. he left for his post here at
SUNYA in July of I975. and the
Houston mission study wasn't
released in its final form until
December of I975.

The Houston study was written
mainly by study director Wallace
Honeywell and Shirley. accordingto
Honeywell as quoted in the Times-
Union.

lloncywell further commented
that the duplicated sections were his
own. and not written by Shirley. who
is credited with authorship of most
of Ficlds‘ mission statement.
