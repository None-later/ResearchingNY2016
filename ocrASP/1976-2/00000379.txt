There are five groups of marshalls
on duty from 4 pm. to I2 midnight.
The service, which has been in effect
since I970 does not formally adver-
tise but according to John Zriebec,
Director of Safety and Security at
Syracuse University. the entire cam-
pus is aware of the program.

Williams said he would be in favor
of such an escort program at
SUNYA ifthe details could be work-
ed out.

He said that SUNYA had a stu~

Williams felt the program had
merit beyond the escort aspect. He
believes that the student-police in-
teraction opened a valuable line of
communication.

Williams expressed that he does
not feel women should have to
change their lifestyles because of the
actions of one ortwo people on cam-
pus.

He said. “Thousands of women
acting out of fear is irrational."
However he added. "If I were a

SUNYACrime’Rate'InereaseMay  :

by Thunes Mormlle

The first eight months of last year
as compared to the same time span
this year, show an increase of 24.6%
in the number of crimes committed
on campus. But this ﬁgure can be
misleading.

Crime Fluctuatee

According to James R. Williams,
the Director of Public Safety for on
campus police.'“Such could be the
case for this years statistics since the
balance between crimes that are
committed and those that are
reported. ﬂuctuates from year to
year. For instance. Williams said ifs
thousand crimes were committed
last year. only three hundred may be
reported. whereas in the following
year iftbc same amount ofcrimes are

committed four hundred cues may
be reported. This would correspond
to a 33% increase in crime even
though the setuel'incidence of crime
had remained unchanged.“ It is hard
to draw any conclusions from such
evasive numbers,” Williams said.

Although the ﬁgures for the sup-
posed increase in crime over the two
year period may bemisleading, those
that show an increase in personal
assault are not. Duringthe ﬁrst eight
months of last year there were two
cases of assault, five cases of harass.
ment and no cases of rape. This year
there have been eight cases of
assault. nine cases of harassment,
one case of rape and one of
attempted rape.

Williams was asked if he thought

 

University cutbacks were in some

'way responsible for the marked in-

crease in personal assatrit. He
replied. “Cutbacks have resulted in'
the elimination of four men from the
police force but only from the day
shift. The night shift remains the
same."
' 1 Reduced Lighting

Williams said, “reduced lighting
on campus could have helped in the
rise in "personal assaults but not for
petty theft where the criminal must
depend on lighting to be able to see
what he wants to take." He added,
“Very few thieves carry flashlights."

Sometypes of crime such as the re-
cent incidence of rape on cam pus re-
quire the service of an investigator
who is on the case continously until

Graduate Students Receive Awards

by Steve Braekett

The New York State Society of
Municipal Finance Affairs recently
began offering an annual 5500 prire
to the outstanding graduate student
inthe School of Public Finance. This
year two students received awards.

According to Sandro A. Barone,
assistant dean of the Graduate
School of Public Affairs.Richard C.
Fitzpatrick, a Doctor of Public Ad-
ministration (DI’A) student. was
awarded a $500 check on Sept. 29 at
(irossinger‘s. in Monticello. The

presentation was given by the New
York State Association of City and
Village Clerks.

James R. Thompson. a Masters of
Public Administration (MI’A) stu-
dent. rcceivcda SSOOcheck from Mr.
Bruno I’ezzano. ﬁnance director for
Schenectady and a member of the
society. The presentation, also held
at (irossingcr‘s, was given on Thurs-
day. Sept. 30.

Advisors Too
Each student was accompanied by
his advisor Jerome Wade. assistant

professor of Public Administration,
was present at Fitzpatrick‘s
ceremony. Richard I. Nunez.
professor of Public Administration.
accompanied Thompson.
Qualifications

Harone said each student was
chosen by his academic record.
quality of written work. and faculty
appraisal.

“of five students considered“ said
Ilnrone. "it was very difﬁcult to
select just two. because of their out-
standing abilities."

    
 

either the criminal is apprehended or
the case is, abandoned. Williams
said. “All felonies and crimes against

person require an investigation."
Crimes of less importance such or
petty theft are simply put on record
and placed on ﬁle. If howeverthere
develops a trend in the number of
times the same crime is committed.
then an investigation will be assign-
ed. Such was the case when two peo-
ple were arrested in the University
parking lot after they stole tWenty
Citizen Band rsdios..
