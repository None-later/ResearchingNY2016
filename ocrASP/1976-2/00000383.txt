By STEPHEN EISENMAN

The sculpture of John Ferro
emerges from the language of
American life. His use of steel.
rusted or roughlyfinished, is part
of the American imagery. This
nation of movers, whose second
home is the highway, is comfor-
table with roads that are littered
with rusted and decaying autos.
We are used to iron girders that
thrust boldly into our urban
space. It is natural that this
should become an integral part
ofour image making. John Ferro
is not the first to use this
language. It is a notion that was
born out of Dada and Duchamp,

The second floor of the gallery
is dedicated to photography, in
an exhibition entitled “Light
Manipulations: Expanding the
Limits of

Photography".

Art: Sculptur

pro-eminent American sculptor.
David Smith.

Smith worked with found auto
and machine parts; ready mades.
He employed industrial techni-
ques in his free adaptation of the
images of Miro, Kandinsky and
the Cubists. The industrial
language is glorified; durability
and resilience are paramount.
David Smith's sculptures are
monumental in scale, though
their expression is intimate. The
geometric masses are precarious-
Iy balanced to produce a feeling
of lightness and motion.

This emphasis on lightness
and movement reveals Ferro‘s
other inf luences.Ferro‘swork is a

  

4.),

Organized by Melanie Walker,
the show is an invitational ex-
hibition of eight artists from
across the country. The works
are often of mixed media.

 

The euuuttetlc photography at John Craig

modern revival of construc-
tivism; the Russian movement of
the teens and twenties whose
manifesto in I920 spoke of the
importance of' movement and
space, rather than volume. as the
imperatives in sculpture.

Indeed. Ferro‘s large steel
works have little . volume.
The flat cast iron sheets. I and T
beams are precariously joined
together with more empty space
than forged metal in each work.
The three dimensional lines and
angles jut out into space in-
truding upon the viewer's do-
main.

The small bronze works are of
a more human scale. The works
are molded in wax and cast in
bronze by the lost-wax process.
It is work of a different order that
is heavy; its massivity anathema
to its small scale. Yet they are
satisfying. The cubist-like
bronzes play tricks with space.
From one angle the space is the
subject of the work; the bronze
merely forming a border. From
another angle the bronze itself,
with'all its surface modulations
and distortions. is the object of
attention.

The mid-sized works are very
fine. Here Ferro has mastered his
sculptural language. His Prop-
Pick is a three dimensional em-
bodiment of Kandinsky's
geometric abstract paintings. It
is a triangular composition with
a heavy l-beam as its base and a
ﬂat sheet at 45 degrees. Smaller,
thinner pieces of steel suggest in-
tersection. The work seems to
have a single vanishing point;thc
viewer‘s senses are manipulated

Light Manipulation

The photographs of Jo Ann
Callis are the most striking.
These stark, powerful images
represent in the artist‘s words,
“my ongoing preoccupation with
a connection between eroticism
and morbidity". The world of
Callis' figures is dreamlike, they
emerge from blackness in am-
biguous poses and setting.

The work of John Craig is
strikingly original. He has
employed design elements,
graphics and color in surrealistic
compositions. The works are
built architecturally, layer upon
layer

John l)i\'o|ii‘s prints are
manifestations ol encounters
with specllic cmironments.
l)i\‘ola observes sparse walls
with great uttenlipn to surfaces.
’atchcs of darkness are am-
biguoust suspended in the spec
of the frame. The works “explore
the interaction between me. the
camera. and the cnviummcnt in
which I act.“

l‘hc preoccupation with the
surreal is alsoevident iuthe work
of Melanie Walker. Her cut outs
pasted on compositions depic-
ting naturc are attempts to con-
struct a different reality. The
prints are repetitive and un-
aesthetic.

by the sculpted planes.

The surface of all these works
is an integral part of the
composition. In the large works,
the red leaden paint has chipped
away or been corroded. This
suggests the processes of
building itself, as rust ﬁrst
attacks the individual welds.
Ferro does not paint the
sculpture with bright pigment;
color is not essential to the
surface. The earth tones of red or
rust. are appropriate in their
intended outdoor settings. And
like his mentor Smith, Ferro
must make periodical visits out
into the fields to repaint his
works. Thus the artist never loses
contact with his work; it is a

continual process of evolution.
Ferro works in an associative
manner. He finds a germ of an
idea. This suggests another form,
and another until a composition
is complete. lt is an ecstatic
process in which the artist
releases. in the manner of the
cxpressionists. ideas and
emotions that are pent up inside.
Included in the show of
Ferro‘s sculpture are preliminary
drawings for these works. They
clearly describe the artistic
evolution of the works. Many of
them are collages in the manner
of the German Dada, Schwitters.
They reﬂect the found object
nature of the finished works.
