' She felt cold and nauseated. On the win-

of milk and some hamburger. I thought
he was a vegetarian. she sniffed silently.
She had never suspected that
vegetarians lived like this. She had never
suspected that anyone she or Michael
knew would live like this. Looking down
at the peeling linoleum. she noticed a pair
. of cockroaches. She had never heard of
cockroaches that came out in the middle
of the afternoon.

_ Jack was always coming up in
Michael‘s conversation. Whenever he was
bored it was always,‘_f.‘lf Jack Were here

ing a good time it was “It only Jack were
here." It was as if. Margaret decided,
Michael felt that Jack's existence justified
his own. But it seemed as well that Jack‘s
existence somehow undercut and un-
justified Michael's own happiness.

By now Jack must be close to thirty.
like Michael. She wondered if he had
changed.

She began to rummage through the
box beside her. It was mostly ﬁlled with
teas and spices. but there were a few
books on the bottom: Siddhartha. The

 

 

“Jack had never scented
quite human to her, but
somethlng like the cross between

She pressed her back against the glass
and drew her jacket around her tightly.
There was no heat: and the snap of fall
had carried itself within the ﬂaking walls
of Jack‘s apartment. Across the room.
Michael lounged against a wall. The mass
of boxes lay between them. Pointing to
them. Margaret called:

“Do you think he‘ll have any more than
these?“

“How should I know?"

“I thought you said he didn‘t believe in
possessions.“

“Well he doesn‘t believe in waste either.
Anyway, it‘s always nice to have some
things to come home to."

“I‘m not so sure." she whispered. “That
we should store his things.“

“Why not?" he replied with an edge of
surprise to his voice. “We have plenty of

pointing to the suddenly bugless floor. “If
We pick uptwo of them. we‘ll never see the
end of them.“

“Hey. don't worry. We're neat. If we
pick up any, they'lljust starve to death,"
responded Michael, ignoring the fact that
he hadn't noticed anything. “Besides. you
can’t let a little thing like bugs come
between friends.”

She shut her eyes and tried to block out
the sight and odor of the place. From
somewhere in the apartment she could
hear small scurrying noises. Were they
from the man who had let them in. she
speculated, or from a mouse, or a rat. It
was definitely the sort of building in
which a rat would live. Cautiously, she
opened her eyes.

And where was Jack. she wondered.
Michael was waiting soeagerly. his hands
pressed deep into his pockets and a
childish smile opening his face. He had
been smilingthat same dumbsmile forthe
past forty-ﬁve minutes. she discovered
upon consulting her watch.

She had never imagined that she‘d ac—
tually meet Jack. Michael talked about
him as if he were dead, or at least very far
away. Jack had never seemed quite
human to her. but something like the
cross between a lumberjack and ti
leprechaun

“You'd really like Jack.“ Michael had
said it hundred times. “Everybody likes
Jack. He has a kind of vitality that's very
rare. There‘s a spark of life in him. a

Angels.

"Maggie." Michael called out sharply.
"Don‘t snoop."

“Oh damn." she sighed. “I wish he‘d
hurry up.“

“He said the afternoon. We must be
early.“

“Michael if we‘re early. then we've
come on the wrong day."

“He probably still gets up late."

"Well maybe he decided not to stop at
our house on the way to lndiaaftcrall."

“Look at the boxes. Margaret. He‘s ob-
viously going somewhere."

“it’s cold in here.“

“Not everybody is fortunate enough to
live in a heated a artment.“ T‘e

reprimanded.

She gave up tryingto make aconversa-
tion. it was odd that Jack had lived so
close to them, hardly half a dozen blocks
away. for so long without ever contacting
Michael. She wondered if Michael felt
hurt by this, but t heeager expectant smile
on his face did not betray any such thing.

“Hey man.” A small man entered the
room and tapped Michael on the
shoulder. Margaret eyed him in surprise.
He was short and almost emaciated. He
seemed to bend slightlyto one side and his
brown hair curled to the middle of his
back.

"It‘s really good to see you. Jack,“
Michael replied. Margaret wondered how
many times he‘d gone over that sentence
in his head. Curiously. Michael seemed to
carry the vitality that he had so often at—
tributed to Jack. He was smiling blithely.
exposing all his plain-perfect teeth. or d
he swayed very slightly on the balls of his
feet. Margaret had rarely observed him in
such a cheerful mood. Jack. on the other
hand. seemed drained and pale. His ex-
haustion coupled with the quiet features
of his face gave him the look of a child
who has stayed up long past his bedtime.
Together. they made a tableau of the
wasted prodigal son returned to the
robust and thriving father.

Jack nudged at Michael‘s stomach
where it swelled above the belt.

“I can see that the good life is takingits
course."

"I guess so." Michael readily agreed.
He continued to smile obliviously.

Jack leaned against the doorway.

“There's just one thing." Jack said.

we move anything to your place.“

“Ah, yeah," said Michael. Jack did not
continue. “What is it?" Michael finally
asked. Jack shook his head with a world-
weargy nonchalance. as if he were half try-
ing to shake something out of his hair.
Not bugs, Margaret hoped.

“Well I‘m having trouble getting things
squared away before I leave.“Jack finally
answered. “Money, shots. you know how
it is. i might need a few more days with
you."

“Oh. that‘s no problem." Michael turn-
ed to Margaret. “Is it Mags?“

She shrugged. Despite the squalor ol
the place. he seemed clean enough.
Besides, she wouldn’t want anyone to stay
a minute longer in this place than they
had to. There was something frail and
vulnerable about Jack too. that made hct
forgive him the cockroaches and lIu/l'i

the first time.

“You didn't tell me you were shackcd
up with anyone."

“Ah. Jack. this is my wife Margaret."
Jack smiled at her and the motion hricl |_\
cnlivencd his face. She still could not
detect the mysterious spark.

"lly the way.“ Jack turned back to
Michael. “You remcmbcr Lcnorc. don't
you?"

“Sure. Nevermore-Lenoch

“Well. I gotta take back everything l
ever said about her.“

“That sure was an awful lot.“

“Lemme straighten things out “till

“That‘s hard to believe." Michncl
laughed.

“No. really. I mean Lcnorc ntztkcs inc

Margaret laughed. Jack was insane. llc

Jack's qualities of frailty and
vulnerability were rapidly dissipating into
lccblcmindedncss and vulgarity.
Margaret decided. Jack slapped at ill\

him in forced hiccup-like spasms.

“Ah. Lcnorc is coming with me to In-

"Since you know where we live. We‘ll
walk and meet you there.“ Michael made
a feeble "V" and stepped back onto the
sidewalk.

“You‘re too old for that." Margaret
hissed as the van pulled away.

“For what?"

“For that peace sign crap."

“I guess it was sort of automatic from
seeing Jack again." he answered feebly.
“Well. what do you think?"

“I think that was the most disgusting
place l‘ve ever seen."

“I‘ll agree with you on that. But what
do you think of Jack? Isn't he just as l
described him?“

“He seemed kind of tired out.
answered diplomatically.

"But couldn't you see that spark?“
Michael pressed.

"I don't know. I guess I don’t know him
well enough. He looked anemic.“

“llut he‘s such an exuberant person. He
always makes me feel alive."

“You seemed to be doing pretty well
without him for the last few years.“

Michael ignored hcr cotnment.

“Has he changed at all?“ Margaret
finally asked.

“That‘s David Carridine. from Kung
l-‘u.“ Jack smiled gleefully and pseudo-
karntcd the table: the picture fcll.
Margaret turticd to hide a smile.

"It‘s a really great program.“ he con-
tinued. “i watch it every week. Have you
ever seen it?"

“I‘m not sure.“ she answered quickly
and turned to leave the roont.

“You‘ll have to watch it with us
tonight." he called after her.

In the kitchen. she found an unlamiliar
woman unpacking thc spices. the rices
and beans. tlic flours and the kerosene
stove.

“You must be Lenore.“ said Margaret.
“l‘m Margaret. I'm afraid I didn't see you
come in."

“1 came in through the back.“

Lcnorc did not look nearly as bad as
Margaret had expected. She was tall and
rather heavy: bttt her voice was low and
pleasant. almost soothing. Margaret sat
down at thc table and watched Lenore fill
her cabinets. Lenorc worked silently.
“What do you do?“ Margaret finally
blurtcd.

Lcnorc turned to face her, She pointed
to it sketchbook on the table. "l," shc

 

 

 

“Mg god, she thought to herself,

who ever would have

thought this of vegetarians.”

 

 

Michael paused bcl'orc answering. “He
looks pretty tnttch the same. a little
thinner maybe."

‘But is he just as you remembered
him."

“i guess he‘s mellowed sortie." Michael
finally answered.

A few hours after they arrived at their
apartment. Jack's possessions. or tion-
possessions as he insisted on callingtltcm.
had transformed the place. At their rc-
qucst. he had taken over the living room
as his bedroom. The floor before the
couch was stacked with sleeping bags and
blankets. An empty waterbcd lay folded
in one corner and the frame stood against
one wall. Jack‘s books had made a layer
over their own in the bookcase and his
many spotty plants crowded at the win—
dow. 'l‘heir stcrco was dismantled in one
corner and had been replaced by Jack‘s
clttborntc model.

Margaret took a record lrom ouc ofthc
scvcral boxes of records and prepared to
play it.

“()h. the stereo doesn‘t work,“ .lnck ex-
plained. “It needs about $40 worth of
work and I‘m a little short right now. thc
trip and all. It you want to fix it. I‘ll pay
\ou back when I return."

Mnrgurcl silently replaced the Iccortl.

In the dinittg room. he had set ups little
shrine. llc liud propped n tratncd picture
of some vaguely familiar religious pcr-
sonngc and draped it with a red and gold
cloth. Sticks of unlit incense smudgcd the
tablecloth before the picture and a string
of worry bends lay over them.

“Who is this!" Margﬂret asked. polit-
tiug to the portrait.

rcplicd in her placid and confident voicc.
“am an artist."

Margaret begun to flip through
l.cnorc‘s sketchcs. They were mostly
lines. the beginnings of trees perhaps. or
pcrhups those of people.

“And what do you do?“

“Mc‘!” Margaret rc plied. “l‘m a critic.“
Margaret, l'ccling less comfortable than
she had in Jack's abysmal apartment got

    

   

up and left the room. She found Michael
in thc redecorated dining room.

“Do you know who this is?" she
whispered as she pointed to the picture.

"Yeah." he smiled and then went on to
explain: “You've got to remember that
Jack is not a man of intellect. He‘s a free
spirit.“

“He doesn‘t need to go to lndia.“ shc
rctortcd. "He should go to Hollywood.“

“llcy Mugs. Jack doesn't judge you.
Yott shouldn‘t judge him.“

Margurct ignored him. walked into
their bedroom. and shut the door.

Later that night. .lack and lcnorc sat
cngrosscd watching Kung I’u. .lack had lit
some incense to heighten the experience
and the scent of sandalwood infected the
house. Michael sat with them for a while.
then joined Margaret in the kitchen.

“Evcn you must admit that the mystic
cowboy is just too much.“ she said.

He smiled: “it‘s not that bad. ljust
came in for some milk."

He opened the refrigerator door:
“What did you do with it?"

Margaret got up and looked with him.
.lack had gone shopping at the farmer‘s
market and the refrigerator was filled
with rusted cabbugcs and lettuce. tiny
moldy brusscl sprouts and other sour
smelling greens. Margaret reached in and

pressed a funny looking bunch ofcarrots.
They met her hand like a sponge.

“Who in their right mind would buy
second-hand vegetables?“ she whispered.

“But where‘s the milk?“

Margaret could not find it on the
shelves and she finally called into the
other room: “Did you see the milk
anywhere?“

After a few seconds. Jack answered:
“There wasn't enough room and it wasn‘t
fresh so i threw it out.“

Margaret slammed the door on the
rotten-stuffed refrigerator.

“You bought that milk this morning.‘
she accused Michael. He stood ex-
prcssionlcss in the middle ofthc kitchen.

“i think I'll watchthe rest of Kung Fu.,‘
he finally said.

He walked out of the kitchen and she
sat herself down at the table. My god,she
thought to herself. who ever would have
thought this of vegetarians. The sink was
full of dishes and she thought she saw a
roach crawl across the counter. She push-
ed hcr head into her arms and tried to
wish away the scent of rotten vegetables
and incense and the sound of their soft
voices in the living room. Listening to
them. she had no confidence that they
were on the way to India; she feared that
they had come to stay.
