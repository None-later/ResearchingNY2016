"symbolic communication and

representation. art has always been
expressive. However. duringthe last

2 decades of the. nineteenth century,’

the term expressionism was used to
denote a particular and distinct type
of aesthetic concern.
_‘ In I“! the poet Mallarme
remarked that the artist should be
less concerned with the object to be
painted than with ‘the effect it
produces‘. And later. the Dutch pai-
nter. Van Gogh. reinforced this at-
titude when he wrote. ‘instead of try-
ing to record what I see. I use color
arbitrarily to express my feelings for-
cibly'. Expressionism. in art.
signiﬁed a departure from the objec-
tive; whether representational or
not. it emphasized distortion and
severe stylization of any or all the
elements in order that more personal
and immediate emotion be conveyed
and sustained. Artists now wanted to
distort both color and line enabling
them to capture their subject's es-
sense with greater power.
Expressionism in the cinema is
generally believed to have its begin-
nings with the German classic The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari(l9l9). Ex-
pressionist tendencies. however. can
be found earlier. especially in the
mature work of D.W. Griffith.
During the climax of Intolerance.
the boy is sentenced to death and is
to be hanged. Interested in the cor-
rect method of representing the
situation. Grifﬁth went to San Quen-
tin to see an actual execution site.
Receiving a negative answer to his
request for usingthe real location in
his ﬁlm. Grifﬁth proceeded to con-
struct his own death chamber. The
ﬁnal gallows which appears in the
ﬁlm was not a mere imitation of San
Quentin. The scene in the ﬁnished
ﬁlm—reduced to a ﬂat and am-
biguous space complete with an un-
usual degree of linear simplication
and harsh tonalities——was Grifﬁth's
interpretation not of what a gallows
actually looks like but what. indeed,
it SHOULD looklike. Emphasizing
certain visual details while ignoring
others, the final result was an ex-
pressive reinterpretation of how the

emotion, through'a'visusl means. in
a‘ very calculated and specific way.

Expressionism in the German
cinema had its roots in two primary
areas. Visually. the key inﬂuence
came from the expressionist pain-
ting of artists like Van Gogh.
Munch. and later the more contem-
porary German painters, most
notably. Kirchner. Thematically. the
major influence arose from contem-
porary German drama. especially in
‘the plays of Hasenclcver. Kaiser. and
Toller. Both these groups of work
strongly focused on one of two
themes: 3 deep emotional crisis ofan
individual or a similar intense crisis
of man within the mass. Armed with
this message and technical resource.
the first German ﬁlmmakers of the
early twenties were ready to create
their dark. obtuse. and wholly ex-
cessive dramas.

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the
first of such nightmares. is probably
the purest and most complete
realization of the expressionist
works from this period. Dr. Caligari
is a hypnotist whose somnambulist.
Cesare. kills the hero's friend and
carries of'f his girlfriend. Having ex-
posed Caligari as the mastermind.
the hero is later revealed as an in-
mate Of a lunatic asylum where
Caligari is director.

Directed by Robert Wiene from a
screenplay by Hans Janowitz and
Carl Mayer (who later wrote the
scripts for The Last Laugh and
Sunrise). Caligari looks very much
like a visual nightmare conveyed
through a succession of ﬁlmed pain-
tings. In terms of editing and
rhythmic pace. the ﬁlm is quite dis-
apointing. However. where it may
lack a vigorous montage. it clearly
makes up for it through an extraor-
dinary awareness of composition
and mise-en-scene (although here.
extremely formalized).

It is the design of the sets. in par—
ticular. which gives Caligari its ar-
tistic power; flat. linear arabesques.

heightened with a distorted perspec-
tive and harsh lighting. Allis subor-
dinated to create a state of anxiety

 

and terror. Even the style of acting is '

dictated by the sets; through an ex-
aggeration of normal gesture. the ac-
tors produce movement which is in
complete harmony with the broken
line and ohlique'composition. Every
element within the reach of the direc-
tor is stylized and fitted into an

overall structure achieving. in this

case. _subjective confusion and
despair. In terms of a consistent
mode of vision, Caligari is complete-
ly successful.

Caligari exerted a strong influence
on the German film of the next
decade. although its long term effect
has tended to be overrated. There
was never another ‘pure‘ ex-
pressionist film made. Among the
first generation of off-spring.

however. were Weine's Hands of

Orlat' (I925). Wegener‘s The Golan:
( I920). Leni's Waxwork.r( 1924). and
Murnau‘s vampire talc. Nosferatu
(I922). And in less obvious ways.
Lang‘s Die Nibelungcn (I924) and
Murnau‘s Faust (I926) incorporate
some Caligari vision.

Besides the overt expressionist
style in films like Caligari. the early
German film was responsible for
ushering in the ﬁrst consistent use of
style in the cinema. German direc—
tors (most ol'thcm alreadytrained in
the theater) were skilled craftsmen
and brilliant organizers; employing
meticulous care for lighting. acting.
set design. and camera movement.
they strove to produce a deep sense
of individuality in their work.
Although much of theirstress was on
the theatrical. their ﬁlms form a
coherent and organic completeness.

Nothing was left out of place or left ‘

unplanned.

Maturity of cinematic style was
born in the classic German film of
the years just following the First
World War.

By SPENCE RAGGIO
The name is perfect: Blue Oyster
Cult. And they've spent a long time
reinforcing the image it conjures up.
Mysterious. satanic, leather-coated
pounding rock n‘ rollers who can
shake the walls of any concert hall
and when they leave. that last guitar
riff is still vibrating in the air.

So Agents of Fortune comes as
somethingofttsurprise. Which is not
to say. by any means. that the Cult
are now an easy listening band: its
just that for the first time they're pay-
ing less attention to the Richter scale
and more to their music. and it's a
welcome change.

There are moments on the album
that create a strange. sudden craving
for a dose of “Cities on Flame.” but
never morethanjust a moment. lt'sa
problem. because on closer inspec-
tion Agents is a series of such
moments. good musical ideas that
for some reasonjust don't complete-
ly gel.

Songs like “Tattoo Vampire.“
“Tenderloin” and “Debbie Denise"
suffer from the sin of
amorphousness-wvcn after ten or
fifteen listenings. they present no
clear identity oftheir own. There are

some nice synthesizer effects on
"Morning Final“ that never go
anywhere. and “True Confessions"
would have been best left on the
studio shelf.

There are bright spots. though.
“E.T.l." and“This Ain't the Summer
oi' Love.“ which sounds like a com-
bination ofthc Troggs and the Beach

Boys.
And there are brilliant spots.
songs where the Cult comes

together. locks onto something and
holds it. “(Don't Fear) The Reaper."
their first ticket onto AM radio. is a
captivating mesh of vocal har-
monies. Buck Dharma‘s multi-
triickcd guitars and percussion that
almost sounds too polished to really
be Blue Oyster Cult.

“The Revenge of Vera Gemini"
also shines. mainly because it really
isn‘t Blue Oyster Cult; Patti Smith
joins in. writing and helping out on
the heavily reverbcd vocals. lending
a tense eroticism to the song that the
cult ordinarily 'never reaches. Pin
that up with her reincarnated Jim
Morrison-Rimbaud imagery. and
the result is easily one of the best
things that the band has ever done.

The English Landlady

By HILLARY KELBICK

I was already sorry I rangthe bell
when the door flew open and she let
me in. I was greeted by a stout
woman. lipstick painted in a new
mouth hiding her own. llcavy gold
jewelry hung from her ﬂabby arms.
Jeweled rings covered her stubby.
enameled fingers. Yanking my
arms. she pulled me inside to a
gloomy hallway. paint chipping
from the ceiling and frayed
wallpaper dangling from the walls.

“How do you do. darling. l‘m
Mrs. Kcith. I've bccncxpcctiug you.
I've got the perfect room for you
lovely girl. You're an American stu-
dent studyng here in glorious

“Uh..l wasn't sure. I wanted to .m'

about the poor housing conditions
for foreign students and felt confi-
dent thal l wouln't be swindled by

chattering all the time. She hadn't
stopped to catch her breath since I
entered what would regrettably be
my home for the next ﬁve months.

My first impression of Mrs. Keith
was that of a harmless. stupid

woman who hadn't yet completely
mastered her a.b.c‘s. She seemed
pleasant enough though and not like
the shrewd. conniving crooks
against whom I'd been warned.
Within ten minutes of moving in. I
had acquired both her family and
medical history.

“Well. you see. I don't smoke

grandfather had one too. After he

outrageously high weekly rent. I
decided to take a long leisurely bath.
After all. Mrs. Keith proudly in-
formed me that (unlike her com-
petitors down the road) she would
supply unlimited free hot water. So.
I made my way lothe hall bathroom.

Without further distraction I

reached the bathroom and turned

“Yes. darling." to me. Thentothe
Prospective tenant. “A lovely
Australian girl will be your
neighbor, such a charming girl and
from a good family."

"Excuse me Mrs. Keith. I‘m
American and there‘s no hot water."
Withthat sheshooed her prospective
tenant down the dilapidated
stairway.

“I'll be with you soon darling. Let
it run.“ she called. I shook my head
in disgust to the guy she was quickly
ushering away.

Two weeks later I got an explana-
tion for the lack of hot water. Mrs.
Keith informed me that when there
was hot water it was free but with the
tremendous overhead she had, the
water was only hot five hours a day.
When. I wanted to know. From 5
am. to 7 am. and from six until nine
in the evening. “The bills. darling.
the bills” became her favorite
refrain.

I quickly learned that Mrs. Keith
was anything but stupid, and cer-
tainly not harmless. Promises were
made and broken with a perfect
regularity. An uncracked cup. exter-
minating the mice. putting a toilet
seat on the bowl — all were promised
yet none ever materialized.

Mrs. Keith made promises like a
politician before election day. Soon
after my arrival. she decided that she
needed a security deposit. . When
shesnatchcd the money, she promis-
ed it would be returned in full.

Somehow though. when I saw that
money drop between those two sagg-
ing overstuffed breasts. I had the
feeling it was lost forever.

And I was right. I lived in Mrs.
Keith's “happy house" (as she liked
to call it) for five months. A week
before my departure she slyly in-
formed me that my security deposit
would just about cover the repairs
for the scratch on my refrigerator.

“I did nothing to your goddamn
refrigerator. What scratch? You
cheating liar." I shouted. By .this
time I had given upthe polite English
generalities I had used for months.

"Ugh. such violence. In America
you're all violent. Have some
respect for your refrigerator H and
for me. At least we English are
civilized."

Mrs. Keith is not even English.
She is a full blooded Italian im-
migrant. Civilized for her meant
rummaging through her tenants'
rooms without informing them.
When queried. she would mumble
something about wanting to “tidy
up" a bit. After all. most ofthe peo-
ple who rented hcr rooms where
"busy" students. And most impor-
tant. l was "her girl". Whenl had the
flu she brought penicillin and hot
soup. .,

“Now. now darling. I know howit
must feel to be so far from home
when you‘re ill." And in the next
breath. “I need some moneyto cover
the cost oflthe soup and‘the pills."

Mrs. Keith was right about one
thing. England was glorious and
even she couldn't spoil it. I‘m almost
grateful to the darling woman. 1‘“

lhc great Athenian lawgiver
Solon said: “You must obey the law
of the land. whether you think it
right or wrong." Socrates took a
similar position. even when he had
been unjustly condemned and was
awaiting execution (Classical
Forum. February 2|. I975). Another
Athenian. who was much less
honorable than either Solon or
Socrates. thc brilliant Alcibiades

‘ (Classical Forum. May 7. l976).was

far less reverent in his attitude
toward the law. In his anorabi/ia
o/"Socralcs. Xenophon records the
following conversation between
Alcibiades and his famous uncle
l’cricles:

A: “Tell me. Pericles. could you
teach me a definition of the law?"

P: “Yes. of course.“

A: “By the gods. then teach me!“

I’: “You arc not asking for

one must do and what not."

A: “Do the people think that one
must do good deeds or bad deeds?“

P: "Good deeds. of course. but not
bad deeds."

A: “But suppose that not the peo-
ple but. as in an oligarchy. the ruling
l‘cw meet and enact laws governing
our conduct. what do we have then?"

I’: “Any rule which the govern-
ment of the city establishes. meeting
in council. is considered the law."

A: "And if a tyrant governs the
city and prescribes the citizens‘ con-
duct. is that too the law?"

I’: “Yes. whatever a tyrant enacts
while governing. that too is con-
sidered law.“

A: “How then. do you define
violence and lawlessness. Pericles“!
[)0 we not speak of violence and
lawlessness when a stronger person
requires a weaker person to do his
bidding. not by persuasion but by
force?“

I’: “It would seem so."

A: “And whcnatyrant enacts laws
not persuading the citizens but im-

 

lawlessness?"

I’: “I agree and withdraw my
earlier statement on that point.”

A: “And when a minority enacts
laws against the will of the majority.
shall we call that violence or not?"

P: "Quite right. whenever
someone forces someone else to do
something against his will. whether
by passing laws or by some other
means, that is violence rather than
low."

A: “And if the people. prevailing
over the property-owning classes
and against their will. were to pass
laws. would that not be violence
rather than law?"

P: “My word. Alcibiades. when l
was your age I too was pretty clever
at this sort of thing.“

Alcibiades is obviously enjoying
himself while demolishing Pcriclcs’
preconceptions. At the same time he
is pointing to a moral dilemma
which has been a common one in our
own century.
