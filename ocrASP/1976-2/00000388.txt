teat‘n viaory. Splitting the weekend
results. the Danettes dropped
FriJay's match, l-6, to St. Lawrence
for their fifth loss of the season, and
then reversed the score on Saturday
against Potsdam for their ﬁrst team
victory..6-l.

How can a team be so incon-
sistent? According 'to Coach Peggy
Mann, the Danettes are steady, it's
their competition that changes.

“We have a hard time finding
teams of our own ability,” she con-
tinued. “Private schools tend to be
either too good or too bad."

Jane Maloy remains'the team's
best player. She captured Albany’s
sole victory against St. Lawrence's
Barbara Schrieder. 6-3, 6-0 on Fri-
day. Second singles Colleen Joyce
lost her matchintwosets,4-6, l-6.to
the upstate netters.

Carol Farrere and Lorna Stio
both moved up to the varsity squad
but neither one was able to turn back
their opponent. Scoring only 24
games off the opposition. the
Danettes marked up their fifth loss
of the season.

Saturday saw a different story.
Windy conditions did little to in-
terfere with the Danettes perfor-
mance level. If anything the weather

The scrum was overpowering in
the game as hooker Dave Rosenberg
