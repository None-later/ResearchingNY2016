Gridders Go For Two in a Row;
Host Potentially Dangerous RIT

by Craig Bell

The RlT Tigers come roaring into
University Field this Saturday look-
ing for their ﬁrst victory of the year.
The Tigers. who have played more
like kittens in losses to Hobart (44-
16) and St. Lawrence (24-0). are still
capable of being a good football
team, according to Danes coach Bob
Ford.

Albany. meanwhile. is coming off
its first win of the year, and Ford
believes the Danes must maintain
the consistency they showed in the
second halfagainst Brockport ifthey
are to come away winners.

Albany has defeated Rthhe last
three years. and has outscored them
92-7 over that stretch. The Tigers.
however, are a much improved team
physically. accordingto Ford. “They
are much bigger and stronger than
they have been in the past.“ in addi-
tion. Ford believes that quarterback
Paul Adamo is the best passer the
Danes will face all year.

Adamo ltas the statistics to bttck
up this contention. He was the
number fifteen leading passer in all
of Division lll last year as be com-

     
  
 

pleted 44.2% of his passes for 1.1 13
yards and seven touchdowns. To
date he has completed 17-34 for 159
yards despite being bothered by an
ankle injury.

The Danes must contain his pass-
ing as they did last year when they
held the strong-armed senior tojust
85 yards passing while intercepting
five aerials.Neutralizing Adamo will
be “a two-foldjob.“ explained Ford.

Albany. Ford said. must put suf-
ficient pressure upon him to make
him rush his throws and then they
must cttt him off from his two
favorite receivers: halfback Ed
Brown and flanker Kevin Loveland.
lf Albany can do this then they
should not have much problem turn-
ingoff the Tigers” ground game.

Tough Tiger Defense

The Tigers' defense is probably the
biggest the Danes will face all year.
Tackles Bob Marshall (6'5", 230
pounds) and Brian Derenthal (6‘3".
215 pounds) are obviously big and
strong. but also possess quickness
and aggressiveness that will put a
burden on the Danes' inside running
game.

The entire offensive line will have
their work cut out for thcm. accord-
ing to Ford. Rl’l‘ lines up in a 5-2
defense and the nose guard in this
formation is a good one.

The Dunes on offense will go With
two complete offensive units as they
did against Brockport. Brad
Aldrich. at quarterback, will get the
starting call after completing four of
six last week. He will he accom-
panied in the backﬁeld by fullback
Mike Mirabella and halfbacks ()rin
Griffin and Dave Ahoncn.

Ahoncn is cotning off a super
game in which he rushed for 99 yards
in three carries including a 59-yard
touchdown gallop.

DeBIois ()ut

Tom DeBltiis rcinjured his
shoulder and will miss the game.
while Glenn Sowalskic is
questionable after missing last
week's contest.

A win in this game will square the
Danes‘ record at 2-2 and give them a
figlitiug chance down the
homestretch. according to Ford.
(lame time is 1:30 p.m.. and WSUA
will cover it beginning at 1:25.

Council To Consider
Parker’s Impeachment

by Jonathan Hodges

This Wednesday. Central Council
will vote on whether to start im-
peachment proceedings against SA
Vice President Gary Parker..This is
the ﬁrst instance in recent SUNYA
history where such an action has
been initiated against a member of
the SA executive branch.

Council's decision to examine the
possibility of impeachment resulted
from charges of harrassment
brought by the Pan-Caribbean
Association against Parker. Their
insistence led the SA Internal Affairs
Committee to draft a resolution to

censure Parker.

The motion was tabled at last
Wednesday‘s Council meeting when
it became evident that there was sulr
stantial sentiment among members
to explore the harsher action of im-
peachment.

“As I understand it. the Pan-
Caribbean Association contacted
Greg Lessne [Council chairman].
who referred them to us," said Cary
Klein. one of the four members of
the Internal Affairs Committee.
“After reviewing the evidence given
by PCA, we felt that the only action
mandttted was censure."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  

 
  
  

 

SA Vice President Gary Parker may face Impeachment proceedings at Wednesday's Central

Dutch Quad Election Status Uncertain

by Ed Grifﬁn

The status of the election for Cen-
tral Council representative from
Dutch Quad is still uncertain. The
apparent victor. David Gold. has not
been sworn in. pending resolution of
an appeal by one of the losers.

On the basis of a complaint ﬁled
on Wednesday by candidate Rob
Hirsh. the Student Supreme Court
invalidated the election. noting that
Hirsh's name was not among those
listed in the ASP on Tuesday. as
mandated by the Comprehensive
Elections Act of I975. Balloting was
conducted Tuesday. Sept. 28,
through Thursday. Sept. 30.

Always lrregularities

After some delay, elections com-
missioner Michael Lissner issued a
statement announcing that new elec-
tions would be held next week.
Lissner had earlier objected to the
expense of such a move. saying that

Roauita oi one of the two tires deliberately set yesterday In the man's

Hirsh received less than two percent
of all ballots cast and had conducted
only a token campaign.

“You can‘t expect this thingto run
like the national government.
There's no continuity in student
government and you always have
irregularities in these elections. 0n
principle. he [Hirsch] has a valid
point. but you have to use a little dis—
cretion.“

Leaders lnsertsitive

Hirsh complained that student
leaders had been insensitive to his
plight and charged that Lissner told
him “I don't care“. and hung up on
him. Lissner denied this charge and
countered by saying that Hirsh. in a
conversation with SA vice president
(iary Parker. offered to drop his
complaint in exchange for ttjob with
the SA. Parker and Hirsh both
denied that Hirsh made such a
proposal, but Lissner and SA presi-

dent Steve DiMco bothrccall Parker
telling them that Hirsh suggested he
be given a job. Lissner described
Parker as "amazed" that Hirsh
suggested such a deal.

Thursday morning Hirsh was
determined to run in the new elec-
tion. but after a conference with
Parker. he changed his mind. “1
proved my point.“ Hirsh declared
afterwards in a joint press briefing.
The Court has shown me to be right
on principle. and I can‘t see spending
140 dollars of student moneyjust on
me.“ Informed of Lissner‘s idea for
reducingthe cost ofclcctions. Parker
answered that the plan would violate
the election laws. Hirsh concurred.
During this session. Parker insisted
that Lissner had no authorityto call
another election. "Since Mr. Hirsh
has withdrawn his request. there is
no need for a new election."

But. according to Chief Justice

Vicki Kurtzman of the student
Supreme Court, as things now stand
there will be no Dutch Quad rep un-
til the rerun is conducted. The SA
could, lichver petition for a rever-
sal now that Hirsh has withdrawn his
objection to the original result.
Typist Error

The problem stems from an ad
placed by the SA in the ASP on
Tuesday. listing candidates for nine
offices. Although Lissner submitted
the complete sample ballot. a typist
accidentally left out the name of
Robert Hirsh. Hirsh filed his com-
plaint the next day, before the elec-
tion results were in.

Late Thursday evening. Lissner
and Parker informed Vicki Kurtz-
mttn that they would file a petition
urgingttn injunction against the new
election. Kurtzman declined tocom-
ment. saying she had not yet received
the petition.

be following him. Upon reaching his
apartment. Browne-Markc‘s pur-
suer pulled up behind the van with a
siren blasting.

Browne-Marke was ordered by
the car's driver to produce a driver‘s
license and insurance particulars.
When he refused. the inquirer
ordered a friend in the car to “call
some other guys. This guy is giving
us some trouble." At no time did the
car's driver state that he was a police
officer'or other public ofﬁcial. When
Browne-Marke moved away. the in-
quirer shouted. “i am going to have
this van impounded!“ and left.

Soon after. the inquirer returned
and promptly identified himself as
Gary Parker. He presented Browne-
Marke with a copy ofthe transporta-
tion request slip for the van which
stated that the van should have been
in New York City at that time. When
he asked why the van was in Albany,
Browne-Marke replied that if there
was any complaint it should be
rendered upon return of the van.
Browne-Marke then went back into
his apartment.

Parker drove off in the van and
later returned with two policemen.
Browne-Marke explained that there
was a delay in the trip to New York

Fires In Gym Set Intentionally

by Mark (ireenstein

The local McKownvillc Fire
Department responded to the Un-
iversityGym's call [or help late Mon-
day afterttoon. and arrived within
minutes to discover fires in the men's
and women‘s bathrooms. University
Police believe that the fires were set
intentionally.

An unidentified woman ran to the
main office and reported the fire to
Gym Supervisor Jeff Carlson.
Carlson imtnediately called the
Department of Public Safety. Un-
iversity Police were overwhelmed by
smoke in the women‘s room and at
5:18 telephoned the local fire depart-
ment. Meanwhile Carlson pulledthe
fire alarm and evacuated the gym.

At 5:2] firemen rushed into the
bathroom ttnd proceeded to fight the
smoke. No sooner did they have
things under control. when they
found another fire in the adjacent
men‘s room.

Assistant Director for Security
John Henighan believes that the
same person began bothfires. He ex-
plained how the arsonist most 1i keiy
began by starting the fire in the
women's room. left the bathroom
and proceeded down the stairs
towards the phones and vending
machines, grabbed a phone book.
carried it into the men's room and set
it on fire.

“It [the fire] wasn't discovered un-
til an hour or two after it was
started." said chnigltan. "
that‘s tltc problem.“

At 4 p.m. a gym maintenance
man thought lie smelled smoke. The
SUNYA Power Division and the
Department of Public Safety were
notified.

llic Power Division investigated
the tltird floor and the roof where the
heating and ventilating mechanisms
are located. They discovered acltew-
ed tip fan belt and attribtttcd the
odor to this. Shortly after. both
maintenance and University Police
left.

“They probably didn't go
anywhere else." sttid Dr. Werner.
chairman of the men's physical
education department and director
of the gym.

Cigarette Butt

in describing the damage Werner
said. “The heat was so intense that
the tiles fell off'the wall." He describ-
ed botlt chairs which were inside the
women's room as totally J " ‘-
ed.

The men‘s bathroom reportedly
suffered only minor smoke damage
and a burned phone book.

Originally Werner had conjec-
tured the first fire to have been caus-
ed by a discarded cigarette butt.
However, he changed his mind when

he learned that there were two ﬁres
in the gym.

Henighan described the damages
as slight and said that things looked
worse than they actually were.

Those involved agreed that the
damage was minimal but held that
the smoke was intense.

When asked who might be respon-
sible chighan said. “it's probably
an attempt to harrass or in-
convenience rather titan burn the
building down." He explained that
when university police went to in-
vestigate the original 4 o‘clock call.
“some kind of pully in the air con-
ditioner needed to be replaced."

Henighan said there is an in-
vestigator working on the case and
that “it is probably not the kind of
tlting a college kid would do."
