evening in the Campus Center
Assembly Hall.

Feminist Alliance. Albany County
Rape Crisis Center, and Psi Gamma,

pus more aware of the threat of rape
and how the handle a possible con-
frontation with an attacker.

Participants on the panel were
Fraya Katz and Vivian Solis from
the Albany County Rape Crisis
Center and Maggie Boys from the
YMCA.

ln-Depth Report

Speaking for over tw0 hours, the
three women gave an in-depth re port
on the problem of rape in Albany,
measures that can be taken to help
prevent a rape. and what to do if at-
tacked.

Solis discussed a number of
precautions Women could take
against a possible confrontation.
However, she emphasized that.
“nothing in this world can make you
100% safe.“

Among the precautions she men-
tioned were, “don't trust people you
don‘t know, after dark travel with
one or ntore companions, and learn

All‘three women on the panel
emphasized the lack of awareness
among women in regard to the rape
problem in Albany. Solis said that
only one in ten cases of rape are
reported to the police ortothe Crisis
Center. ’

John Henighan, of the University
Police who attended the panel to
offer some insight into police
procedure regarding an attack, ex-
pressed the necessity f or women who
are attacked to report it to the
authorities as soon as possible.

Organizer of the panel, Teri
Holbrook, also offered some alter-
natives, and preventive measures
that women on campus can take.

One ofthesc is the idea ofancscort
system on campus. Holbrook
pointed out that many schools, in-
cluding Syracuse University and the
University of Colorado, already
have sonte kind of escort system.
Although a system. similar to the
one at these schools is still in the
preliminary stages here, Holbrook
said that any woman could be es-
corted on campus by gcttingin touch
with University Police.

In an attempt to combat bad
checks, University Auxiliary Ser-
vices has permitted the National
Commercial Bank to install, on a

trial basis. a Bank Key system on '
.campus.

The Bank Key system offers im-
provements over the present system
of check cashing on campus. Under

the present system one mayonlycuh

personal checks up to $50 and se-
cond party checks are not accepted.
The Bank Key system will permit
withdrawals and deposits of up to
$100 and allows the deposit of se-
cond party checks. A service charge
of twenty-five cents per transaction
is still required under both systems.
Two Restrictions

Zahm says there are two restric-
tions that the student body should be
aware of. In extraordinary cir
cumstanccs, such as check cashin;
ran out of money, withdrawals
would be limited to less than $100. In
addition, one could not draw im-
m'ediately on a checkjust deposited,
but would httve to wait a couple of
days.

According to Robert Branley ,
marketing officer in charge of the
Bank Key Department of the
National Commercial Bank, the
Bank Key is “an extension of our
checking account service."

Branley said that the Bank Key, or
the electronic funds transfer system,
is the wave of the future."

The Bank Key has asafetyfeature.
Alongwiththe creditcardissued.thc

password. This word is what allows

A National Commercial Bank and Trust Company representative demonstrates the Bank Key
system, recently installed by use to combat iraudulent check cashing.

“the customer wanted greater access
to their funds when and where they
desired . . . and since it is not
economically feasible to build new
branches and havecxtended hours, a
system was devised to allow such ac-
tivities in retail outlets.

At present, the Bank Key system is

the Bank Key system at SUNYA was
to reduce the occurences of bad
checks.

According to Zahm. the check
cashing service incurred a $10,000
loss in bad checks as of last May's
audit. This September tt loss of S7,-
900 was reported.

stantaneous computer check is made
of the keyholder's account. If the
keyholder does not have enough
funds to cover the cashing ofa par-
ticular check, the machine will con-
vey such information, and not per-
mit that check to be cashed.

Zahm says “if the system [Bank

Presently. the National Commer-
cial Bank is the only bank inthe area
with such a system. But kanlcy
thinks that within a year at least one
or two other banks in the‘area will
provide the service. Branley says he
“expects to receive a reasonable
payback for the use of their system.”

According to Branley, one may
obtain a Bank Keycard by openings
checking account at the Bank and at
that time ask for a Bank Key card.

It takes about two weeks for the
card to arrive and another week for
your word.

USSR Expansion

UNITED NATIONS. N.Y.(AP) On
the heels of a new Kremlin peace bid,
China's foreign minister charged
here Tuesday the Soviet Union is try-
ing to expand its influence in the
world and said it ultimately will wind
up in a war with the United States.

on Moscow by Foreign Minister
Chiao Kuan-hua—who was making
China's first major foreign policy
since the death of Chair-

man Mao Tse-tung—appeared to be _
a “thundering rejection" of a ten- *
tative offer for Soviet-Chinese
reconciliation in aGeneral Assembly
address last week by Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.

The Chinese government has long
maintained that war is inevitable
between the United States the Soviet
Union and Chino told the General
Assembly, “This is independent of
man‘s will."

In addition to the usual Chinese
denunciation of Soviet “social irri-
perialism” and “expansionist ac-

should shake off any fear of the “
Kremlin because its outward ,t
appearance of strength was under-
mined by internal dissension. “There 4
