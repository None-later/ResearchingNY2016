 Advisement

by Slllll D. Emerson

In the beginning, all academic ad-
visement at SUNYA was handled by
the faculty. -

Then, around 1962, the college of
freshman studies was establist
providing freshman with non-
tcaching professional advisers.
Shortly thereafter, the service ex-
panded to include sophomores and

' was given the name it holds today—

univcrsity college.

“We were able to do that during
the good times.“ said acting vice
president for academic affairs David
Martin. Martin said in the 60's the
university had the available
resources to provide “continously
available advisement for freshmen
and sophomores.“

The state's ﬁscal problems in the
past several years, however, have
meant a reduction in all facets of un-
iversity affairs. The state Division of
the Budget, has pinpointed reduc-
tions of student services. the budget
ctttcgory into which university
college falls. And the 1975-76
I’residcnt's Tusk Force on Priorities
and Resources at SUNYA conclud—
ed, “The university is overstuffed in
this budget category [university
college] computed to the other three

 

faculty members, in the school or
department of their major.

' - Increasing faculty involvement in

academic advisement once again
raises a question voiced at the incep-
tion of university college — who is
best qualified to advise students?

“Fundamentally I would prefer to
advise somebody from freshman
year through," said Richard Hauser,
biology professor and coordinator
of academic advisement for his
department. But he admists. “I'm
defeated by the sheer numbers of
(students)“.

Hauser said that when university
college was ﬁrst established, many
faculty members "complained about
it." “We now feel that university
college is necessary," Hauser said.
“If we got all the majors (in our
department), we Would do a Worse
job of udvising than we do now.”

"My basic underlying philosophy
is that faculty should do advising,"
said Ruth Schmidt, dean of the
humanities division. There‘s
“something about having the most
educated people on campus do ud-
vising," she said, adding, “whoturc
they on campus but the facully'.’"

Schmidt said she feels it is “ur-
tificiul" to create a special service for

    

iversity on the other. - r

While Schmidt said she would
have liked to see university college
résources distributed within the un-
iversity to better facilitate faculty
advisement. many person: feel there
is a need for both advisors versed in
the general requirements of the un-
iversity and those who are specialists
in their field.

“I feel that the students who have
not made clear career decisions need
to he advised by cducdtional
generalists," said Neil Brown. dean
of student affairs. “University
college has been particularly effec-
tive in that role."

Brown says he feels faculty may be
too busy to become knowledgeable
in a great number of fields. “After
all. it‘s not their role," he said.

Brown adds, though, that he feels
there is an irreplaceable relationship
between a student who is interested
in a particular ﬁeld of study and n
“mcntpr” in that ﬁeld. “I think it's a
job faculty do best,“ said Brown,
speaking of the ttdvismcnts of
students who have dclcurcda major.

Some students express similar

viewpoints. John, a senior sociology
major who transferred from Sullivan

 

centers (SUNY Buffalo, SUNY
Binghumton and SUNY Stony
Brook). We must reduce the
positions and cxpenditures in this
area.“

Speaking to the idea of coordina-
tion of the total “undergraduate ex-
perience. " including academic ad-
vising, Martin said “We have to have
people who very speciﬁcally give
their full professional attention to
undergraduate affairs in general.

"ow". Undergrad Experiencé

Regardless of whether the univer-
sity retains professional people to
handle the advisement of students
with undeclared majors and to coor-
dinate the “undergraduate ex-
perience," faculty members will be
increasingly involved in the process
of academic advisement. This fact,
coupled with Martin‘s assertion that
“we ask so much of (the faculty)
now." raises yet another question.

rewards for faculty members to
