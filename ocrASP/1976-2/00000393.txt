“controversy has brewed for years

of the parties involved. Does the

have the arbitrary right to ban films
or issues deemed 'unfavourable.‘
These are the question: being rais-
ed by people across the' country.

Speedy. deﬁnitive answers are not I

likely to be coming in the near

obscenity laws by the Supreme

Al Golditeirtf‘the New York porn

king, was hauled to acourt in Kansas .

to stand trial for mailing ‘obscene
material' to another state. The catch
is that the mailing was a Federal
government set-up. who paid a few
individuals to subscribe to
Goldstcin‘s publications so that the
government could nail him. Federal
prosecutors felt that they stood a
better chance of getting a conviction
in Kansas than in New York. Golds-
tein is convinced that he was singled
out by the government because of his
anti-Nixon and anti-Chief Justice
Burger stances back in I973.

All involved feel. beyond im-
mediate consequences. that the
ruling on their cases infringe upon
their First Amendment rights.
Further. media people in general feel
that the Reems and Goldstein cases
read like obituaries for the First
Amendment.

Observers note that in order to

OCTOBER 8. 1976

 

  

’ who claims to have been briefly
taken aboard a U.F.0. last year says
he was told that the planet earth is
being studied by a federation of ad-

.vanoed races from other planets.

The sergeant. Charles L. Moody.
claims these intelligent being: told
him they will make their presence
known to the entire world within the
next 24 months. Moody adds that
this alleged intcr~stcllar contact will
not—~in his words— "Be a pleasant
type of meeting." '

Moody‘s strange story began in

August of last year when he says he
drove into the Arizona Desert to
watch a predicted meteor shower. ‘

The sergeant claims that a circular
craft streaked from this sky. and that
he was over-powered by small beings
and taken aboard the ﬂyingsauccr.

 

Moody describes his alleged cap-
tors us standing about five feet tall,
weighing about “5 pounds. and
looking very humanoid. cxeept for
having unusually large heads with no
hair. He recalls that they had large
eyes and thin lippcd mouths. but that
they seemed to communicate with
him by transmitting thoughts or us-
ing E.S.I’. rttthcr than by talking.

Moody sttys he was told that
sometime within the next two years,
a federation ol‘cxtrntcrrcstials which

A 33-year-old Air Force Sergeant

   

has been studying the earth will
make'contact with us.‘l;le adds th'st
theirmesssgefrsther than bringing
immediate joy.zwill consist of un-
pleasant warniny. 

According to Moody. an alliance
of different kinds of intelligent
beings on several otherplanets “fear
for their own lives" because of what
is occurring here on the earth.

Moody says that the beings were

very kind to him and that their intent
is peaceful: but he adds that they
have warned they will “protect
themselves at all costs."

The Tucson-based Aerial
Phenomena Research Organization.
a well-known U.F.O. research
group. rates Moody‘s credibility——
despite his strange account—as be-
ing extremely high.

ROVER, ROLL OVER!

An Australian man who was un-
able to find work is offering himself
as a household pct.

Forty-six-ycar-old Josef Holman.
in a televised interview in Sydney.
told nationwide audiences that he
was offering himself as a house pct
because he thinks animals are better
trcatcd than humans.

Says Holman. “I'm also willing to
perform tricks like a pet for my
master and mistress." like rolling
ovcr and fetching the fatnin
newspaper.

IIolman says he had applied for
about 2000 jobs over the past two
years, but was always turned down.

Science Digest Magazine is repor- ;
ting that the Pentagon is funding
psychic research projects. looking
into the possibility that,E‘.S.P. could

‘hecome a major comonent of

weapons of the future. t

 

According to the publication.
several branches of the Defense
Department are interested in scien-
tiﬁc studies which indicate that the
human mind can leave the body and
witness events taking place in other
parts of the world.

The magazine says that ex-
periments at Stanford Research In-
stitutc in Mcnlo Park and at The Un-
iversity of California at Davis in-
dicate it might even be normal for
most individuals to possess psychic
abilities.

The navy is reportedly interested
in what is called "remote viewing."
defined as the ability to spot or
monitor potential military targets in
another part of the world using only
cluirvoyancc.

Science Digest says that military

 

researchers are {also interested in
repbrts that certain psychics. like _Uri
Geller. can use their mental powers
to’, bend objects or even to erase.
magnetic tapes. j ' ‘ ‘
If a person could; in fact. erase
tapes through mental processes. this
would enable that individual. the
magazine says. to wipe our entire
defense‘systcms which are coor-
dinated by computers using
magnetic tape. ' '
Science Digesl quotes one
Berkeley PHD. candidate in parap-
sychology. Jeffrey Mishlove. as
stating that anyone with'the ability
to jam up computer systems through
psychic powers C‘would probably
have to be destroyed." Mishlove
adds. however: “If this hypothetical
psychic were truly talented. death
probably wouldn‘t even stop him."

“SABOTAGE”

A nationwide organization of psy-
chics claims to have accomplished
what modern science has failed to
do . . . explain the cause for the
mysterious “Legionnaires Discasc.’
in Philadelphia.

The society of the source states it
has conducted tt poll among its
members. and that most report they
have picked up feelings or vibrations
of “sabotage”. According to the
society‘s co-foundcr. Leah O‘Lcary.
a majority of psychics from around
the country are explaining that
sabotcurs probably triggered the
disease-one seer saying business
cards from a militant group were
handed out that gave ofl'toxic fumes
