A seeminlyinﬁnite number olcity
bars reﬂect the same trend. No

However. the picture drastically
changes upon entering an average
comemponn' bar located in some
dean-mum suburb. Bright ﬂashing
lights and loud rock. disco music in-
vade the senses immediately upon

'The barmaid, clad in a white
halter top and tight white pants con-
tinues. “At ﬁrst it was unimportant
as to what type olloos balltable you
had in the bar. As long as you had
some form of loos ball table it was
0.K. Today, it’s different. A new
trend in loos ballis beingdeveloped.

The new trend Karen goes on to
say is different styled (modeled) loos
hall tables. There is an “Italian”
model which has a glass bottom.
This makes the ball move much
more rapidly. A “French” loos ball
table provides diversion since its
allignment of men on rods is
different than the position olmen on
an ordinary loos ball table.

The German styled table is smaller
and consequently allows each team
to be manned by one person instead
of two. The ‘English" loos ball
model. according to Karen. has a
smaller goal area. making it more
difﬁcult to score.

Due to popular demand Karen‘s
bar will be putting in a glass loos ball
table some time this month.

Across tow n. at another suburban
bar. the trend has already made its
appearence. A glass surface table is
located at one end of the bar. A small
two-man table at another.

"Initially. when I ﬁrst got a table

shouts in his small dark ollicc ﬁlled
with loud music."l though it would
last SIX months at most. However.
now it doesn't seem as if it is a pass-
Ing lad.

"The type of young crowd which
