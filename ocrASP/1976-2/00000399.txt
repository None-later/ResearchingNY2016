Long May
You Run

By JOEL FELD

“Long May You Run“ marks the
reunion of Stephen Stills and Neil
Young recording together for the
first time since I970. Recorded in
Miami, the album highlights the
differences beIWCen these artist‘s
post Springﬁeld and CSN&Y solo
careers.

It‘s often impossible to discuss the
works of Stills and Young without
bringing in some comparison with
their two former bands. However
since the breakup of these two
groups, the careers of both these men
have taken different turns.

0n the one hand. Neil Young,
usually backed by Crazy Horse has
consistently put out good. im-
aginative music, successfully freeing
himself from the comparisons ot' the
past. Stephen Stills seems to be stuck
in the past. Like Young. Stills has
attem ptcd a solo career. but general-
ly his records have been poorly
received. lacking in content arid
production. Whatever the reason
(somc say his period of drug
overuse). Stills has been unable to
get anything serious together for
more than a few months at a tune.
One has only to look at the Stills-led
band. Manassas. potentially one of
America‘s finest assortment of
musicians in this decade. which
failed miserably both on record and
on four.

The rising career of Neil Young
and the slumping career of Stephen
Stills more less brought tltcsc twoar-
tists together' for an attempt to hit off
lllL' "old magic." But nothing doing.
This album was originally intended
to be the ('SNdLY reunion album
following their brief l‘l7il tour. In
produlion since late W75. ('S.\&Y
wandered in aird out of the Miami
studio doing littlc recording and
plenty of arguing.

What resulted was L'rosby and
Nash laying down some vocal liar-
monies only to have Stills and
Young replace them With [no
members of the back tip band that
play on the album. Joe Vitalc
(drums) and Joe Lalo (percussion).
Combined with Jerry Aicllo on
piano and George Perry on bass.
these session men provide Stills and
Young with a more than adequate
buck up band.

The major prohlcin with the
album is that it doesn't flow. I‘or
anyone looking for tile old
Springfield sound. "Long May Yotr
Run" is no more than two solo
albums by two individual artists. put
together on the sttmc piece of vtltyl.
On it close listening. it's easy to dis—
tinguish between the Stills and
Young compositions. There is simp-
ly Ito cvidenccthroughout the album
that the two men were working
together on the record.

Despite the obvious short-
comings, “Long Mtty You Run" is a
ﬂood album. It simply isn't the

toachievea unified sound. Neil plays
his usual scratchy guitar alongwith a
couple of different melodies thrown
in. The Stills cuts are typically Stills.
They could have appeared on any of
his solo Ip‘s from his first effort to the
most recent.

in a recent interview with Rolling
Stone magazine. Neil Young was
asked why he chose to take a vaca-
tion from Crazy Horse and tour with
Stephen Stills. His reply was that he
wanted to help out an old friend with
his tour. The poor reviews that the
blind received and its aborted
schedule after only three weeks in-
dicatcs the lack of continuity
between them. Not coincidentally.
the Stills and Young compositions
are alternated throughout the
album. Maybe they should have put
all the Stills songs on one side and
the Young songs on the other.

Individually the album produces
no surprises. but together as the
Stills/Young Band it just doesn't
make it.

Moving Targets

By MATT KAUFMAN

That Moving 'l'urgcts. the new Flo
and Eddie album. contains nothing
radically different from any of their
previous albums. not surprisingly.
Their random shots of aspects of life
Americana are also not surprising.
In fact. nothing is really too sur-
prising about thc album except the
ama/ing internal and external con-
sistency of each of the songs.

Consistently cynical. One of the
trademarks of Flo and Eddie (aka
Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan)
has been a tongue itr cheek view of
this world. For years. this dynamic
duo has been writing and/or perfor-
ming hit songs that were. in actuali-
ty. pot shots at the world. They gain-
ed this reputation during the l960‘s
in a group known; the Turtles.”

a very pleasant product. In fact, this

the best they have made so l'ar. The
mass record buying media should be
immensely pleased with it. In fact.
the product is so pleasing. one might
even venture to label it as “commer-
cial”. htit would Ho and Eddie do
that?

Private Eyes

By JEANNE SAIEWITZ

At twenty-five. Tommy Bolin is
the product of a rich and diverse
musical background. His highly
respectable credentials include lead
guitar with Billy Cobhatn. James
Gang. and finally. Deep Purple. Un-
fortunately. evidence of the wide ex-
perience gathered from these vastly
different artists fails to reveal itselfin
Bolin‘s second solo effort. Private
lives.

I’rivulc lives is a loose collection
of simple. rather undefined songs
that have little in common other
than washed-out quality and
lovcsick tone. This alhtrm has no
core. no heart. no flag to rally
around; it lacks a forming concept
other than tltc traditional. childish
last song -s|ow song -fast song
arrangement. The times (all written
wholly or in part by liolin) are pure
and uncomplicated. bttt too much
so. some of them are downright un-
musical.

It‘s doubtless. however. that Bella
is a gifted and many-faceted
guitarist. His electric guitar is
smooth. down-played and filmy in
the mellow “Sweet Burgundy." and
jumps in “Post Toastcc" to a playful
imitation of Eric Clapton's deep.
scratchy guitar in the days ofCream.
It dabbles in unusual. syncopated
rhythms in “Shake the Devil,“ and
releases all its stored-up energy at the
end of the final cat, “You Told Me

 

 

That You Loved Me." A sudden
switch to acousitc guitar in the
soothing “Gypsy Soul" is a pleasant
surprise. for Bolin handles it ex-
pressively. clearly, accurately. ef-
fortlessly. The same beautiful
acoustic is accompanied in “Hello
Again" by a very compatible. lilting
string orchestration.

Bolin's band is adequate. with the
exception of a more-than-adequate
saxophone player named Norma
Jean Bell. This girl‘s nimble, ex-
pressive sax shines through in every
cut; it almost solelycreates the mood
for each song and remains one ofthe
highlights of the album. In addition,
Norma Jean sings a strong harmony
and almost forms a one-girl chorus
in "Bustin‘ Out For Rosy."

Of his own album. Bolin says.“Up
until now. most of my musical
growth has been reflected by the
bands I've been in. The most impor-
tant thing about my new album is
that it shows my progression as an
individual" band.

But Private Eyes" progression
follows a road to nowhere. Bolin‘s
music combines blues. rock.jazz and
boogie but results in no conclusion
of his 0Wn. and therefore is not
meaningfulsubstance. lfthetalented
Tommy Bolin wants to remain a
soloist. he has some artistic growing
up to do. and that‘s certainly
something to look forward to.

The Beckies

By BRUCE CONNOLLY

There are certain things that just
sound so silly that there's no way a
grown person can adjust to dealing
with them. I couldn't admit to listen-
ing to a group with a name like The
Beckies any more than I could ease
intoa Friendly‘s and order a Fribble
or Mac Donalds and order an Egg
MacMuffin. Even if I did kind of
want to.

Michael Brown. the old l.ch
Bankeroo who wrote “Walk Away
Renee." is the mover behind this
band. While there isn‘t a song here
that ranks with that richly textured
beauty. melodically the album is
pretty sturdy. Ballads and soft
rockers with lots of deft time shifts
riding on Brown's respectable

amateurishuess works to their ad-
vantage because it reinforces the
aura offreshncss and naivete that the
band is eager to cultivate. The
prohlern is that the back hicks the
authority to realize the inherent

tion of the Grateful Dead both in
rhythm and word. Sir Doug (Doug

qualities of Bob Weir and Leon

Salim. who has been in the
business for over fifteen years. has
indeed seen it all and done it all..but
unfortunately has come away with
too much of all he has done. It is dif-
ficult to listen to any song on the
album without being reminded of
some past great. It is one thingto be
influenced by certain tn usicians, yet
it is quite another to conceal your
own talent within nnother‘s style.

Among the other musicians in the
band is Harry l-lcss. a superb peddle
steel and slide guitarist who
dominates much of the album. Yet
all too often just as you get drawn
into the beat. the song ends (usually
under three minutes). a fatal
characteristic of many sixties
groups. The remainder of the group
has George Rains on drums. Jack
Barber on bass and
singer/songwriter Atwood Allen,
who combine for fine background
vocals and instrumentals in true
redneck country tradition as in “I
Love The Wat You Love". This is
probably the most dutstanding. ass-
kicking country song on the album.
Early rock influences are also pre-
sent. They appear as very mellow ﬁf-
ties, blues-type in“Yon Can‘t Hidea
Redneck (U ndcr That Hippy Hair)"
at the end of the album. The song
leaves us with a final moral judge-
ment “I don‘t care how mrtny joints
