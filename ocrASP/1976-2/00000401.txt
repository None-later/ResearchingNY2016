President Ford was embarrast by charges
that his plan to double America's national
parkland was'mtire an election year ploy than
a proposal or real substance. Critics of Ford
have pointed out that most of the additional
acreage is iirdesolatc wilderness areas in
Alaska. not ideal for the tourist or
backpacker. Yet, now the President has
replied by saying he will quadruple. not dou-
ble our existing parkland.

We talked ‘to members of the Interior
Department who handle national park affairs
about the President's suggestion. They said
they knew nothing of the project. After
questioning numerous sources of information
throughout the federal bureaucracy, sur-
prisingly, it was. an official of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) who explained the proposal:

 

. Increases Parkland

“Yes”, said the official. “the President will
quadruple recreational areas by incorporating
Vast sections of Mars into our park
system . . . Mr. Fordfeelsthelandingofthe
Viking space probes on the planet gives us
claims extending several thousand square
miles. This land will be the new parkland."

“It is a bit wild up there. I can‘t see campers
enjoying the lush vegetation and lakes that ex-
ist in Earth parks. I heard from NASA‘s top
brass that Ford will announce the new park's
location when the Viking I‘s biological tests
confirm there is life on Mars. So at least
vacationers will be able to hunt.

Another source told us Interior Department
regulations may impede the institution of a
Martian National Park. National Park fire
prevention rules state there must be a
minumum of one ﬁre tower occupied by a
minimum of two ﬁre rangers for every fifty

SandWich Thief Found

by Jack Simmons

After a complete investigation. University
Police nabbed a student and charged him with
the theft of a ham and cheese sandwich (hold
the mustard). The theft. which occurred late
Monday morning. took place in the Campus
Center cafeteria. Working against the odds.
the University Police banded together and
searched the campus thoroughly. Sgt. Yuts
(cafeteria division) explained. “We were work—
ing against the clock all the way. We had to get
thc kid before he digested it. Yuts tells the
story. “I was sitting at my desk. it was a cold
day in Albany. temperatures ranging in the
50's. We received at call for assistance from the
cafeteria at ||:3l. Altcr getting all the info. I
[ll‘thL‘L‘tlL'd thch to interview some witnesses. |
arrcvcd at the cc ill I Iz-lS and found we had
very illllt.‘ to go on. lhc only description we
could got was [hot the suspect was a young
czItIcIIsInn. approximately Ill-20 years old.
\chIring :I Look In IIIII(‘hildren'li-shirt. After
Itlcrling nll authorities. we started a massive
manhunt which rcsultcd in the arrest of 29
students. We just begun hooking every man
\\tllllitll and child wcttring onc of those T-

shirts: it really threw us off ." Yuts admits now
that his men might have gottena little “carried
away" in their pursuit of justice.

Finally. the case broke as the 30th and Jlst
suspects wore marched into the office: both
were caucztsiuns. approximately Ill-20. and
wearing ’l'clcthon 'l'-shirts. Yuts says he must
be credited with the next move: each student
was intcrrogntcd alone. “We finally got a con-
fession from one of them. who admitted to
stealing and eating a sandwich of the ham and
chccsc category.“

"What hnppcncd“: says Yuts. “was that we
decided to let the other suspect go because he
kept insisting he was a vegetarian." What
made Yuts positive that the other student was
guilty‘.’ “Just to he sure the kid wasn‘t pullinga
last one on us hycontcssing. we made him cat
burnt toast il IId wash it down with a cup of tcn.
It made him puke! After that. we sent the
results to the lab and waited. Two hours later

his story was confirmed." I questioned Yuts as I

to the motive behind this hi/nrrc cuss. Yuts
responded. “I lcll sorry lor the kid; he said hi:
