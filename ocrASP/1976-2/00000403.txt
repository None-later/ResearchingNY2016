Practicing up for the Eastern
Collegiate Tournament this
weekend. the Albany State Women‘s
tennis team brought their record to
3-6 during the past week, dropping
to Middlebury (0-7), and Skidmore
(4-5) and surfacing to Oneonta with
a close margin of (5-4), for their third
season win.

On Tuesday, the Danettes played
“some close, good matches," accor-
ding to coach Peggy Mann. against
the Oneonta netters.

 

match as the Danettes defeated Oneonta.

Jane Maloy. taking her second
loss of the season, earned only one
game off Oneonta‘s top seeded Lori
Gross. Winningfor Albany in singles
competition were 2nd position
Colleen Joyce (6-3, 6-2). 5th position
Barbara Zimmerman (6-2, 6-2) and
61h position Fran Greenberg losing
the first 3-6, and takingcommand in
the second and third, 6-2, 6-0.

The doubles teams of Maloy and
Paula Sausville. and Zimmerman
and Greenberg won (6-4, 6-4), (6-1,
6-0) respectively.

        

 

"We played ‘six and repeat‘,"said
Mann,‘ “to help prepare the players
that'il be representing Albany at the
Easterns."

The Eastern Collegiates, the
highlight of the-Danettes season, will
be held at New Paltz this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. The Albany
entrees are Jane Maloy, singles com-
petition, and Colleen Joyce and Dec
Strand burg, pairing for the doubles
division.

A total of 121 players from 41
colleges in New York, New Jersey,
Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia.
Maryland and Washington are
entered. Held annually. the tourna-
ment was captured last year by the
University of Virginia, aided by the
talent of lop-seeded Cindy Brinker,
daughter of the late Wimbcldon
champion Maureen Connolly
Brinker. lirinkcr will be returningto
the number one position this year its
a sophomore and is favored for the
title.

Bringing the J.V. results up to
date, on 'l'hursday Sept, 30 the
junior nellcrs swept Russell Sage off
the courts 5-1) and faced their
“toughest opponent“ according to
Coach Louise Covilt. this past
Wednesday, absorbing their first
defeat to Mohawk Valley CC. 2-3.

With a won-loss record of 4-1, the
J.V. team has two more remaining
home matches, (on Oct 12 against
RP] and (let. l5 against Hudson
Valley (‘.C.) in their ‘76 schedule.

 

 

“We have been, having a very
deceptive season thus far.” said
Junior Varsity Soccer Coach Stu

      

Shalit. “This team is one of the most.

  

talented J.V.‘s ever."

Thus far, the Pups’ record is
a disappointing 1-4, butthreeof the
losses have been by one goal. The
first game, a loss, came at the hands
of Hudson Valley Community
College by a score of 3-2. The game
was tight the whole way, but Hudson
Valley capitalized on one more op-
portunity.

Three (lays later the Pups hosted
R.l’.i., but once again came out on
the short end, 3-2.

During the third game of the
season, the Pups were leading
l-lartwick by a score of 2-1.
However. Albany goalie Frank
Carton, while making a diving save,
received a blow to t he head which re-
quired six stitches. 'l'he Pups
surprisingly have no back-up goalie.
so left-wing .lcnn DuVul was assign-
ed the not.

[he momentum turned in
Ilariwick‘s favor. and they went on
to defeat the Pops. Again the score
was ﬁlm 2. The one bright spot inthe
l’up cloud was Mutt Ancin. He had
scored in the ﬁrst three games and
was the offensive lender.

Sicna was the next opponent and
Carreu was not available. The Pops
played a half-hearted game, with

their morale in the minus column.
. ‘ Coach Shaiit knew theteam need-
ed a victory to boost their spirits.
The rematch against R.P.1. w. the
pivotal game. Carrea was ready to
play. but his effectiveness was a
question mark. -

The ﬁrst half showed a different
Albany squad from the game against
Siena. The Pups were hustling, and
went off at halftime leading 2-1. The
second half saw Ancin, connect
twice to lead the Pups to their ﬁrst
victory of the year.

"Ancin is definitely the offensive
spark of the team,“ said Coach
Shalit. “lie is very aggressive. He is
always around the ball and that is
why he always scores. All his goals
aren't pretty. but that doesn't matter.
He is surely headed for the varsity
next year.“ Ancin has scored six
goals in the young season, including
at least one tally in every game.

Shaw The Leader

Shalit cited Basil O'Leighton, a
right wing, as another offensive stan-
dout. “He is the fastest player on the
team." On defense, John Shaw, ac-
cording to Shalit, is the leader ofthe
puck. He, "holds the defense
together."

Overall. Shalit feels the Junior
Varsity Soccer team will end the
season with, “a winning record."

The next game is tomorrow after-
noon, when the J.V. joins the varsity
on the trip to Union, a local rival.
