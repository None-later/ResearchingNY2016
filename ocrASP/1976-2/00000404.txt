Ruggers Third in SUNY Championships

"sysonxtin

This past Saturday. the Albany

.State rugby team managed a third

place finish in the SUNY Rugby
Championships held at Brockport.
. Albany played its first contest
agaimt Brockport and lost by a 9-4
score.

State took an early lead as Gary
Conlin ran the ball in. A missed con-
version. however. left the tally at 4-0.

Midway through the second half.
Brockport put three points up on the
scoreboard via a penalty kick.

Still, as time ran down. State’s one
point lead loomed large. Yet with
two minutes remaining. a Brockport
crossﬁeld kick caught the ruggers
with but one man back. This slip—up
was devastating, as the four-on-one
situation ended in Brockport's first

runners, indicated the poor running
of the barriers 'prilo’ryto last Satur-
day's meet versus Williams and Ver-
'mont. '
in a rare display of consistency.
the Danes broke their six-meet los-

try of the game. The conversion put
Brockpon on top by the final score
of 9—4.

In the consolation game, Albany
faced Buffalo State. Buff's play was
uninspired, as Albany came away
with a t8-0 rout. At the half.
Albany‘s lead was 4-0. as Niall
McStay galloped tenyards to score a
try.
Second half action saw John
Fiorella. in a great display of in-
dividualeffort, blast his waythrough
the Buffalo defense at double State‘s
margin. Ex-gridder Andy Lee added
another Albany try after making a
nifty interception of a Buffalo
backfield pass. McStay‘s conversion
made it [4-0.

Late in the game. Andy Lee rou-
nded out the scoring with his second

barriers suffered. as in the words of
Munsey. “a good beating.” falling to
a tough William squad, 22-34.
Albany's top six runners in the

try of the game. The final score was
Iii-0.

The tournament was won by Cor-
tland, who defeated Brockport by a
large margin in the final. Albany
took third. Oswego fourth. and Buff
State ﬁnished last.

This Saturday. the ruggers take on
Oswego State in an away game. The
contest will settle the third place
ranking in the state. since both teams
finished the tourney with 1-1
records.

  J 

meet recorded their fastest personal
times on the 5.05 mile course.
Leading the Dane pack. as he has
done all year. was Chris Burns. He
ran quite well. winning the race in
25:36.

“Chris is running so ﬁne." ex-
claimed Munsey. i am thrilled to
death with him. he's doing a great
job." What makes Burns‘ time more
impressive was his health on the day
of the race. He wasjust getting over a
two week cold. but nevertheless. still

0 “bulled his waythrough." according

to the coach.
Underelasst'nan Star
But it was a couple ol‘sophomores
and freshman who actually were the
key runners in the meet. Kevin
Burnett and Mark Lavan finished

6th and 9th respectively. while Matt‘

Williams continued to live up to his
great expectations. ending the race
in 7th place. Munsey's compliments
grow greater for him after each race
he runs. “Matt is getting stronger
every week; he and the sport just go
together. Hc‘s cmotionallysuited for
cross country."

The coach called his two
sophomore performances “super.”
He particularly noted the comeback
that Lavan made after being hurt last
year. and his present return to varsi-

ty. after a short stint with the J.V.
Munsey now says. “He’s there (varsi-
ty) for good.”

One Dane runner who made con-
siderable improvement from the last
riangular meet is Eric Jackson. He

ased his time by l minute 4i

seconds, finishing in 13th place out
of 27 barriers. Mark Dalton came in
two seconds ahead of Jackson in
l2th place, securing the fifth and
final point position for Albany.

Munsey was not totally surprised
with either the Danes' victory or
defeat. He explained. "I thought we
would beat Vermont badly. but not
that badly. As for Williams. there
was no way we could have beaten
them; they have a real good team.“

But Munsey described the race as
"the first decent meet we‘ve run all
year." Unfortunatelyforthe Danes it
didn‘t come sooner. as losses to Cor-
tland and Coast Guard might have
been prevented.

Losing Streak Ends

And the record six mcct losing
streak? The l5-ycttr Albany coach
explains. “It was like it nightmare. it
is awful to be in the doldroms. It is
partly over. but we're not out ofthc
woods. We can sec a little ofthc sky

. ." For Albany‘s sake. they hope
they will see more of the sky. and a
In! less of the woods in their ﬁnal few
contests of the 1976 season.
Tomorrow they hit the road to face a
tough colgate squad before entering
the SUNYAC’s next week.

The Albany State men's varsity
tennis team. in its last match before
the State University of New York
Athletic Conference championships.
defeated Plattsburgh 9-0 last week.
here at Albany. The victory im-
proved the team‘s record to six wins
against no losses.

The contest was marked by ex-

cellent play by all of the Albany
players. The Danes didn‘t lose a set
in any of the nine matches.

The six singles winners were:
number one Paul l-‘cldman. Mitch
Sundlcr. Dave Denny. Matt Reich.
Phil Ackerman and Mike Fertig.
The doublcs winners were Feldman-
Sandlcr. Denny-Reich and
Ackcrman-Tom Zimmcrmann.

J .V. Harriers Inconsistent

by Jon Papkln

The Junior Varsity cross-country
runners havcthus far established a I-
4 record. Inconsistency has been the
major reason for the team‘s lack of
success.

Their first win came in their open-
ing mcct. Cobleskill and Albany ticd
under conventional scoring. as the
scores for the positions of the first
five runners for each team were
.cqual. 28-28. Using the tic-breaking
method of counting only the first
four of each team. Albany won. l7-
2|.

‘l'uking first in the race was Mark
LilViln of Albany. us he ran a “hilly”
5.| miles in 27:59. Steve Kilpiitn was
Albany‘s second man. finishing
third.

Four straight losses followed. as
the l’ups ncxt lost a double dual
meet to Sicntt and Hudson Valley. A

poor team performance resulted in
two quick losses.

With their record I-Z. the next op-
ponent was a well-trained Army
tcam. Despite it 19-44 loss. Albany's
liill Mitlhiilh’ finished strong to take
second. thus earning it varsity
promotion.

Steve Kttplan starred in the next
contest. as the Pups lost a close mcct
to Williams of Massachusetts. 26-33.
Kiiplitn. the Nassau Indoor (mill) yard

Sum Quinoncs finished fourth. and
Joe Rinchttrt fifth.

l’ttt (ilovcr. Albany‘s young
couch. tillribtttcs the record to a luck
of preparation. “Most of the guys
httdn't done it lot of distance running
during the summer.“ he said. “As we
get into better shupcr. we should im-
provc overall.“

Ne‘t'ters Roll To Sixth Straight 

Fcldman‘s victory was his fifth
without a loss this season. Sandlcr‘s
was his fourth without it loss.

The surprise of the season has
been the superb play of Reich. a
freshman. He has won all six of his
singles matches and has fuilcd to
drop it sci in any of them. His play
has earned him the number four
position on the team.

The Danes. winner of the
SUNYAC chanpionship the past
two years. are favored to repeat as
champions this year. Coach Bob
Lewis expects the toughest competi-
tion to come from Hinghttmton.
runner-up the past two years.

Lewis stated. "The key to our
success is getting strong pltty from
the number four. five. and sixsinglcs
and also the number three doubles.
The top part of our ladder is very
strong."

in individqucompetition. Albany
has two defending champions. Felti-
tmtn won the number one title as it
ircsltmun whilc Denny won the
number three titlc. l-‘cldmttn is lln
overwhelming favorite to repeat as
champion this year. according to
Lewis.

A strong contender for the
number four title is Reich. Lewis
claims that he has it good shotat it.

The championships. which begin
today and continue through
tontorrow. are being held on the
courts behind Indian Quad.
