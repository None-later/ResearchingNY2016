Albany State does not have a foot-
ball game scheduled for tomorrow.

That's probably the best ‘ thing
that's happened to the Danes so far
this season.

After Albany's latest not-so-hot
performance. a l7-7 win over an out-
matched. but game. RlT tann Satur-
day. it's time for Coach Bob Ford
and his players to put their early
season disappointments behind
them and come out with disdain for
their- ﬁnal ﬁve games.

But don't think Ford doesn't
know it's time for a turnaround. “We
can‘t afford to wait any longer if we
want to get'things worked out,“ the
coach said. “These two weeks before

i the Cortland game are a helluva time
for us. The way we use the time could
make or break our whole season.”

The ﬁrst thing Ford hopes to ac-
complish before the Danes” “second
season" starts is getting his walking
wounded out of the training rooms
and into the ballgames.

"We‘re no different from any
other team." Ford said. “You‘ve got
to be healthy to win. The extra week
off should do wonders for guys like
Tom DeBlois and Glenn Sowals kie."

fullback. has been out with an in-
jured shoulder. It's hard to punish
anybody if you can't use your
shoulder. Hopefully. Tom will be
ready when Cortland comes to town.

Halfback Sowalskie has been on
the Blue Cross program all year. His
problem is an injured thigh. With a
week off. Glenn should get healthy
soon.

But injuries are Mother Nature's
department. What the coaching staff
and the players can correct are the
rash of mistakes that have plagued
Albany all year.

“We still made too many mistakes
against RlT,“ said the coach. “But
when we were right. we really show-
ed ﬂashes of brilliance."

Ford was so right. At times Satur-
day. the Danes were more powerful
than a locomotive. their backs were
faster than speeding bullets and their
defensive line was able to leap over
RlT's guards and tackles in a single
bound.

But even Superman has a
weakness. His is kryptonite. The
Danes' is penalties and turnovers.

Albany got the yellow flag treat-
ment no fewer than eleven times for
l3§ yards against RlT. They also
had one touchdown called back and

had another near-miss wiped out by
a clipping penalty. “We had trouble

coordinating things with all our

different people going in and out."
Ford said.

But despite all the confusion.
Albany did manage to roll up 407
yards rushing. When the Danes do
play the game right. they are
awesome.

Take the Danes' second posses-
sion of the game. for instance. It
took just seven plays for Albany to
drive 60 yards to the MT endzone.

. Mike Mirabella did the honors from
one yard out. The big play on the
drive was supplied by Orin Grifﬁn.
(iriff made a 25-yard run to set up
the score. He ended up with 87 yards
rushing on the day.

After Albany's first touchdown,
the score locked at 7-0 as neither
team showed any desire to light the
scoreboard.

Albany‘s defense made sure RlT
didn‘t take advantage of anymistake
its offense made. Throughout the
game. the Dane offense giveth to
RlT. and the defense taketh away.

“John Adamson and Marty
Thompson didafinejob." Ford said.
“So did Steve Shoen and John
Lawrence. All our defensive people

Siena Downs Batmen Again, 1 2-5

by Jerry Gray

On Wednesday afternoon. the
Albany State batsmen played Siena
College for the second time this fall
baseball season. And for the second
time. the hard-hitting Siena team
teed off against the Great Dane
pitching staff. Lead by Bob Helm
and Bob Murphy. Siena scored five
times in the first inning and never
looked back. winning bya final score
of 12—5.

Larry Roburge. starting pitcher
for the Danes. pitched a fine seven
inninp but was hurt by several
ﬁelding miscues and his own inex-
perience. These were the key factors
when Siena tallied five unearned
runs in the ﬁrst inning.

Mark Massaroni opened the in-
ning for Siena when he legged out a
hit to shortstop. After a fly out to
center, Dave Davies lofted a high
pop to short leftfield. What should

have been the second out became a
costly error when shortstop Marty
Riccio dropped the pop.

That opened the gate for Siena us.
two batters luter. Bob Murphy un—
loaded a triple to the leftccnter ﬁeld
driving in two runs. Asingle by Bob
Helm and a bulk by Roburge uc~
counted for the remaining Siena
runs in the inning.

Albany looked like it might outdo
Siena in their half ofthe inning. ‘l'Wo
walks and singles by John Craig.
Roger Plantier. Jim Willoughby.
and Charlie Scheld produced three
runs and left the bases loaded with
nobody out. But as so often happens
to State baserunners. they Were left
stranded with no more runs crossing
the plate.

Albany picked up a run in the se-
cond. narrowingthegspto 54. State
then had two golden opportunities

to tie the grime in the fourth and fifth
innings. but wasted both chuncc be-
ing victimized by poor bnscrunning.

Siena stretched their lead to 7-4
when Bobby Bladcl doubled home
two runs in the sixth inning. The In-
dians added a run in thcscventh on a
home run by Dich Smith. They then
put the game out of reach with three
more runs in the eighth inning. The
big blow was Doug Miller‘s triple
that scored two. Every Siena starter
had abuse hit inthe game; Bob Helm
leading the way with four safeties.

Sllverman Stars

Starring for Albany was Jeff
Silverman who reached base five
times. powering two doubles and a
home run. Roger Plantlerulso added
two rbi's for the Danes. State fans
will hopefor better results tomorrow
afternoon when Albany closes out its
fall season with a doubleheader
against Cortland on the road.

played good football."

Meanwhile. the Albany offense
needed a lift. so Ford called on Fred
Brewington and Brew delivered at
first asking. It was Marabella again
that made Brew look good. Mike
gained 36 yards on Albany‘s second
touchdown drive. And he also got
the TD call from the twa-foot line.
Larry Leibowitz‘ kick was perfect
and it was R.l.l’. for RlT.

The second half was a big
headache to Brad Aldrich and both
teams. Brad. who had started the
game at quarterback for Albany. sat
out the last 30 minutes with a con-
cussion. The way the two teams per-
formed on the field, though. you‘d
think Aldrich‘s headache was con-
tagious.

A Lcibowitzthrec-pointer from 38
yards out. his best ever. was all the
scoring Albany did after intermis-
sion.

RIT managed to break the Danes”
streak of eight consecutive quarters
without giving up it touchdown
when Paul Adamo hit Kevin
Lockwood with a five-yard TD pass
just twenty seconds before the final
gun.

Checking the stats. Mirabella end-
ed up with 78 yardsto go along with
his two TDs. and Dave Ahonen con-
tinued to play well at halfback. The
former quarterback runfor 82 yards.

Cortland is here next Saturday at
|:30 pm. By that time. the REAL
Albany State football team could be
ready for them.

“ Public Policy as. Liberal Arts

by Bryan Holzberg
SUNYA‘s public policy mission

came under questioning on many

wide-ranging points at a public
forum in place of a University Senate
meeting yesterday.

The forum, held in Lecture Center
18. was a response to the ﬁnal

paragraph of the mission proposal
which reads. “The major task now at
hand is to identify any needed
changes in. and additions to. the pre-
sent document. The should be sub-
mitted...by October 15 [Friday]."
"I‘m shocked at the paucity of
response to this statement." said

SA President Steve DlMeo questioned what public policy means for
undergraduates at yesterday's Minion public forum.

Two Suspects Held

by Mark (ireensleln

Two fifteen year olds ap-
prehended 'l'hursdrly are being held
responsible for lircs set at the Un-
iversity (iym last week. according to
University Police.

“There is noqucstion that they did
it.“ siad University Police in-
vestigator. (inry O'Connor who wrts
working on the case. He refused to
give details stating. “We wouldn't
want to outline our sources of infor-
mation. It may inhibit further infor-
million."

O‘Connor attributes thcsucccss lo
the Department of Public Safety in-
volved.“ he said smiling. “it was a
matter of routine investigation that
was hrougi to a successful close."

The fire was reported by an urt-
idcntificd woman who ran to the
main office of the University Gym
and reported it to Building Super-
visor Jeff Carlson. Carlson phoned
the Department of Public Safety
who shortly arrived and attempted
to put the fire out. They were an:
successful due to overwhelming
smoke and they called the
McKnownvllle Fire Department as
Carlson pulled the fire alarm and
evacuated the building.

The damage was slight. Two
lounge chairs in the women‘s room
were burned beyond repair and had
to be removed permanently. A
telephone book was the only damag-
ed thing in the men's bathroom.

“We have failed to evokethat free in-
tellectual interplay which
characterizes a university.“ Some
l00 people attended the forum and
eight had asked for time to make
specific responses.

“The pursuit of the liberal arts
must be at the center of the universi»
ty.“ said Hans l’oblsander of
Classics. sounding a central point of
many of the comments. “The cost of
public policy is too high to the
humanities.“

President Emmett B. Fields.stan-
ding beforcrtmicrophoneintliemid-
die of the lecture center. rejected the
notion that liberal arts might be
sacrificed to public policy concerns.

“1 can‘t sec any way to strip down
departments for the sake ofaugmen-
ting public policy.“ said Fields. “Our
value lies in detached. accurate
assessment reaching back into
cl: ical notions ofthe body politic.“

The mission statement singles out
a number of program I0 be given
special support in studying state
problems.

Fields said that currently un-
derstaffed programs will receive an
increase in faculty lines and support
funds as soon as feasible and that
many of these programs are already
involved in public policy analysis.

Bernard .lohnpoll of Political
Science. quoting Cervantes of Don

He added it seemed to be a case of
juvenile delinquency. Since the two
youths are juveniles the matter will
be resolved in Albany family court.
“We may let the kids work out the

Fires ln I913
in February 1973 ﬁres broke out
within six days of each other on in-
dian. Alumni and State Quads.
A faulty electric blanket started
the Indian fire on the second floor of

Onondaga. Although the fire was
confined to one suite. sections of
Onondagn‘s second and third floors
were damaged by smoke. Noxious
fumes closed both floors for the
night forcing residents to bed down
with friends, in hallways and in
lounges.

The Alumni fire started in first
floor room in Waterbury Hall. The
cause of the fire was not determined.
Resident Assistants snuffed the blaze
using eight Waterbury tire ex-
tinguishers. The walls. ceiling and
carpeting in the room were

destroyed. This fire was marked bya
faulty alarm system which went off
in the dorm but failed to sound inthe
fire station.
Tunnel Flre

The fire on State started in a
tunnel area surrounding the lower
lounge between Cooper and
Anthony Halls. Flames broke out
amongst furniture that was being
stored there by the Housing Office.
The fire burst in water pipe and caus-
ed smoke damage tothe Cooper Hall
lobby. The cause of the f ire was un-
known.

thcrc any information on how sucha
mission would affect undergraduate
students.

Ira Zimmerman. a student
member of the University Senate
said that the document contains “a
lack of clarity on student input into
university decisions."

Richard Wilkie of Rhetoric and
Communications said that student
concern for teaching quality and
where it stood in the mission.
troubled him.

“We don't have any across-the-
hoard evaluation of teaching skills
which the mission should address."
said Wilkie. He added that the mis-
sion proposal did not contain“a
single guideline or word on tenure
and promotion. We should not be
fiddling around with government in
lieu of scholarship.“

Clifford Brown of Political
Science called public policy a "public
relations approach to higher educa-
tion. We should adhere to
traditional cxccllancc.“ Brown said.
He questioned if “service to the state
of New York“ would be considered
when evaluated by outside sources.
“The standard of evaluation is a
comprehensive University and the
primary responsibility ofthe Univer-
sity is to provide a liberal arts educa-
tion." Brown said.

Fields said be welcomed the
various comments on the mission
noting the ease with which over-
sights in its initial draft could occur.
“A mission without faculty input
andsupport would achieve nothing."
he said.
