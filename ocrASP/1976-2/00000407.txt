Ned Tolbert is currently facing
charges that could lead to his expul-
sion from the University of the
Paciﬁc. a small school in Stockton,
California. '

What could he have done to raise
such a ruckus at this expensive
private school?

Well. last spring, a couple weeks
after he became editor of the
Paelﬂcan. Tolbert decided to run a
story that uncovered a campus
prostitution ring. allegedly operated
by several women who needed
money to pledge sororities.

The reporter. who refused to take
a byline, claimed two confirmed
sources would verify the ac-
cusations.

The ex-editor. faculty advisor and
editorial board of the Pacifican all
agreed that the story should be
printed. And so Ned Tolbert ran the
damning article and the natives tried
to chase him out of towu.

He was immediately ﬁred by the
Student Senate and notified by the

The Senate then appointed an in-

story as editor. That person soon
resigned.
