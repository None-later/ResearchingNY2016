POT PERCEPTION

A new study has come to ths sur-
prising conclusion that Marijuana
apparently helps monkeys unders-
tand one another more clearly.

A drug researcher. Robert Miller,
reports be devised an experiment in
which two monkeys worked together
in order to prevent both of them

from receiving an electrical shock.

The experiment worked by having
one monkey receive a signal from a
light that the shock was coming. A
second monkey in another cage. who
couldn‘t see the light. was able to
prevent the shock by pressing a but-
ton. The only way the second
monkey knew that the shock was
about to come was by noticing a
worried look on the face of the ﬁrst
monkey.

Miller reports that repeated tests

parner was worried. and that they
acted more efﬁciently to prevent the
shocks.

Miller, writing in the mournal
Psycho-Pharmacology, suggests
that monkeys. like humans. might
have more insight about non-verbal
signals from their friends under the
inﬂuence of pot.

CHANNEL “MUD”
The village of Carrdle in Scotland
has the strangest television reception

that when the tide is Iow.the TV
signals are somehow absorbed into
the mud.

As a result. the tidal charts are
consulted as often as the TV logs are,
and die-hard viewers often trek in-
land to relatives‘ homes to watch
their favorite showa when the tide is
out.

An airport ofﬁcial stated during
the dedication that “The reason that
flying saucers have never landhd on
the Earth is because there are no air-
ports for them." .

The UFOport will be open 24-
hour a day. and there will be a special
bonus for the ﬁrst UFOthat lands; it
will be exempt from paying the nor-
mal French landing fees.
