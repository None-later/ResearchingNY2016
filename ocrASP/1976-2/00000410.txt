The‘ee were the last words of Judp Keegan
to the “Colonialil l.”llnfortunately this means
little to those people who once tied what will
soon be a parking lot asanathl'etic ﬁeld. What

the judge reallytnesns is that the system works ‘

became people arelree to protest agath what
they have no powertochangeinlthe first place.
This may sound confusing. but it's true. The
judge's last words were very similar to the last
words of a defense attorney to his client in a
trial that was ﬁlmed and broadcast on the
Public Broadcasting System. For thoeeof you
who never hadachanee tosee this. I'llgive you
a brief run-down, as the situation is a little
different from that of the Colonial ll.
Basically. a Black activist in Colorado (one
of three states which permits photographic
equipment in a courtroom) was being framed
by the racist police department. We can say
“framed” because he was acquitted; in fact,

during the trial. the racist attitudes of the
police. andthe'conclusibn that it was probably
the police who committed the cririte in the ﬁrst
place. became increasingly apparent. After
winning his case. the lawyer, full of idealism.
asked his client if the acquittal didn't prove to
him that the system could still be employed in
the service of the people. The latter. however.
was not impressed: as he put it. how did the
system “work.” when he. an innoncent man.
had to stand trial? How did it “work” when
police could so easily harass citizens whom
they don't like? It was the police who should
have been on trial, not he. .

But who is it that has been assigned the role
of the “bad guys" in the parking lot affair? The
Student Organizing Project! SA President
DiMeo says they caused trouble by
demonstrating while he was talking with
SUNYA President Fields. Judge Keegan
called these students “freebees.” oppor-
tunistically usingany issue. The purpose of the

  we... After'AII'

SOP's demonstrating seems to have been
deliberately muddled to lend credibility to this
idea.

What was at stake here was more than the
loss of a playing ﬁeld. The concern was with
the rights of students. the rights of citizens in
our society. It doesn't take too much
newspaper reading to see that the “rights of
citizens" has undergone a lot of trouble from
the "system" these past few years.

The argument. of course, is that the system
only works if the laws are obeyed. And I guess
it doesn't matter if these “laws” were achieved
democratically or not. Besides. why should the
school administration be concerned with the
feeling and attitudes of students—they really
don't need the thousands of dollars each stu-
dent pays in tuition. room and board (not to
mention the taxes paid by their families). And

 

why should the administration be concerned
with the feeling and attitudes of the faculty—
after all..their work may beeducating people,
but that's not much good to the university
budget. .

In short, what was at stake here was the
powerlessness of the people who work and pay
to make this university what it is. We have
been so thoroughly deprived of our rights that
when we protest against further losses we are
arrested. Can anyone say future protestors
will “get off easy?”

Similar to hundreds of other cases. the real
criminals—those who dictatorially decide
what ﬁeld shall become a parking lot and what
department shall be scrapped—accuse the op-
pressed for "breaking the law." It's Emmett
Fields and his ilk who should be arrested and
serving time. not students.

OCTOBER 12, 1978

 

 

 

By MATT KAUFMAN

George Gritzbach was sitting
alone on the stage. A Bluesman.
that's what he is. Some guy up there
on a stage. playing in front of an
audience, playing the blues.

The crowd was still small at the
Freeze Dried Coffeehouse; the first
set wasjust beginning. An hour or so
later. the Assembly Room would be
filled with people wantingto hear the
music.

Carefully picking his old black
Gibson guitar, the one man became a
whole group. For two years. Gritz-
bach had taken lessons from the late
Reverend Gary Davis; learning to
pick the string; as the Reverend did.

“With the right playing style."
Gritzbach observes before the ﬁrst
set opened, “you can make a whole
sound out of the guitar, you don‘t
need a whole group."

The opening tune was a Robert
Johnson number called “Kind
Hearted Woman.“ Initially. there
was an uneasy air between the
audience and the artist which dis-
sipated by the end of the first set as

luesman

the two became acquainted with
each other.

“For a longtime, I've been looking
for a sound." George explained.
“After a while. I realized that the
sound was from the rooms that they
played in and the guitars that they
used when they made their recor-
ding."

The ﬁrst set neared an end after
nearly forty minutes of playing.
“Before I go off, I'd like to know if
any of you have any requests?"
George asked.

uHesitation Blues,“ in voice called.

“St. James Infirmary." called
another.

“House ofthe Rising Sun." a third
asked.

“That‘s just like ‘St. James Infir-
mary‘ ", George replies. He decides
to end the set with another Robert
Johnson tune, “Dust My Broom."

By the start of the second set. the
Coffeehouse was completely filled
and the uneasiness ofthe first setwas
gone. in this set. as with the third.
George played several requests such
as “Hesitation Blues" and “St. James

George didn't know all as words. ‘

but his playingwes smooth so no one
seemed to care.

The audience’s enthusiasm during
the second set was apparent. Hand
clapping, foot stomping, and various
other noises accompanied Gritzbach
as the crowd singing a jug-a-band
song. The Bluesman referred to the
song as an “audience intelligence
test."

“St. James Infirmary” and an in-
strumental that was based on an
Edda Baker tune closed out the set.
Both were favorites for the audience
and the artist.

The third and final set also con-
sisted of many requests, including
the Cab Calloway song. “Minnie the
Moocher.“ and a cocaine song.

Within several minutes. the once
packed Assembly Room was prac-
tically empty. Nothing was left to be
done or played that night. George
had played for over two hours and
his voice. hoarse from a cold. needed
a break after the many audience re-
quests.

 
 

 
 
 
 

     
     
       
   

No Romance

The night of the Albany

premiere began auspicioust

Brahms Bravura

By STEPHEN EISENMAN

On Saturday and Sunday
evenings the Manhattan String
Quartet. Findlay Cockrell and the
University Singers performed an all
Brahms program in the Recital Hall
of the PAC.

For the Quartet and Mr. Cockrell
it marked the resumption of a
musical vauaintanceship begun this
summer at the Westboro Music
Festival in Northern California.

For Ann Tcehan. SUNYA
graduate and teacher in the Albany
Public School System. it was an op-
portunity to perform the great
Brahms Horn Trio with two fine
musicians.

And. for Stephen Osmond. it was
a chance to show off his University
Singers and the progress they have
made in a few short years.

For the audience. it was pure joy.
The first piece on the program. the
Trio in E-flat Major, was beautifully
rendered. Ann chhan on horn. Roy
Lewis (a member of the quartet) on
violin, and Findlay Cockrell on

piano were perfectly coordinated.
Their phrasingand tone were impec~
cable.

The second work performed was
the Liebeslieder Waltzes. it was per-
formed in the lounge immediately
outside the Hall where chairs and
performance stands were set up. The
experiment proved successful. The
high ceilings and plastered walls
produce the proper amount of
reverberation which enhanced the
voices of the singers. Thisevened out
the few unblended voices and helped
to integrate the piano accompani-
ment of Findlay Cockrell and Lorri
Ward.

The final piece performed was the
Quartet for piano and strings in G
minor. opus 25. Again, the playing
was very fine. though Findlay
Cockrell might have played the final
Rondo a bit softer to emphasize the
wave-like effect of the piece and to
bring out more cello.

The Manhattan String Quartet
will return for an encore in the spring
semester.

torian.

The opening work, Harris'
Symphony No. 3. began with a sour
note. and myspirits were immediate-
ly dampened. The work. as
American as bad apple pie. is dreary:
Its neo-romantic elements were
muddled by poor phrasing and in-
tonation. The orchestra was ob-
viously short on rehearsal time. and
this was the piece that suffered most.

The second piece performed,
Schuman‘s beautiful Symphony No.
4. was far better. The musicians were
more composed; the phrasing was
more secure and the tones more
lyrical. Better rehearsed. the cellos
played cleanly and crisply, and the
woodwinds. (particularly Randall
Ellis on oboe) were outstanding.

There were problems however.
Conductor Hegyi rushed the work.
The pauses between sections were
too brief. The brass section was prac-
tically ignored while the strings were
overemphasized.

The second half of the program
consisted of Tchaikovsky‘s 2nd
Piano Concerto. One of the most
popular works/ of the concerto
literature. the work is full of pianistic
fire. Yet the work is not all bombast.
and soloist Earl Wild. despite a few
technical problems. was perfectly
awarc‘ofthc pieces subtleties. Within
harrowingly fast passages. he main-
tained control of color and phrasing.
This was especially remarkable con-
sidering the orchestra‘suneven per-
formance. Hegyi seemed oblivious
to the soloists accents and phrasing.
Yet Wild persevered and the piece
was very enjoyable.
