ERRATUM: In Friday‘s issue of the Asp. Barbara Zimmerman was
mistakenly noted as the tennis player. The picture was actually that of an

continued from page sixteen

past Albany goalkeeper Dario
Arango. Yet twice the ball stopped
dead in puddles just in front of the
goal line. On both these occasions.
Albany booters recovered their poise
to sweep the ball out of danger.

“It‘s about time we got some
breaks.“ said Schieffelin. who add-
ed. with good reason. that
“Providence was on our side.“

The players adapted totheir sticky
situation. As dribbling is well-nigh
impossible in a swamp, the ball was
advanced mainly through the air.
The Bootch tried to avoid the
quicksand-Iike center of the ﬁeld in
favor of the less-trampled sidelines.

With 33 minutes to go in the se-
cond half. Union managed its ﬁrst
tully. With the conditions as uncer-
tain as they were. and with all that

time remaining. the outcome hungin
doubt. The persistent Albany
soccermen. their white uniforms
'now a grimy black. kept plugging
away. Finally. with 30:I9 gone.
Albany's Aldo Sergovich iced the
game on a penalty kick for a ﬁnal
score of 3-I.

At New Paltz. the sky rained
shots. not water. Albany was
decidedly the better team. out-
shooting their rival by the
overwhwlming margin of 33 to 2.
While goalie Arango napped.
Albany‘s offense tore intoa stunned
New Paltz team that was forced to
throw a cordon of nine men around
their beleaguered goal.

Center halfback Stan Gage can-
noned the first goal from 25 yards
out into the net's upper left corner.

bounded in the ﬁnal tally of the game
to make the score 2-0. This goal
come near the end of the game. so
Albany never could let up. “We
didn‘t have a chance to bring our
subs in." said Schieffelin.

The score obviously did not reﬂect
Albany's offensive domination. Why
did 33'shots produce but 2 scores?
Coach Schieffelin felt the reason was
a psychological let-down he said his
team experienced after a trying I-O
loss to unbeaten Cortland. “It made
it tough to get up for New Paltz.

And the fact of playing a weak
team after a toughie like Cortland
may have made the Albany booters
overconfident. Tomorrow the
Hooters face Oneonta on the road.
WSUA will broadcast the same
beginning at 3:55.

JV Boaters Nipped By Union, 3-2

by Ken Kurtz

This past Saturday, the Albany
State JV soccer team was defeated
by their Union counterparts. 3-2.
The game was played in the rain. and
playing conditions were terrible. as
numerous puddles dotted the field.

State jumped out to an early I-0
lead as wingman Basil O‘Leighton
drove one home. with the assist go-
ing to striker Matt Ancin. Union
scored later in the period to make the

score H at the half.

Early in the second half. Union
managed a 2-! load. However.
Albany tied the game midway
through the second half its center
forward Jerry 0rdcn scored the se-
cond Albany goal. Matt Ancin pick-
ed up his second assist off ofthe goal.
Union took the lead for good
minutes after theAIbany goal. mak-
ing the final score. 3-2.

The weather was horrible. and

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

play was very much affected by it.
The first Union goal was scored as an
Albany fullback attempted to feed
the ball backto goalie Frank Correa.
However. in the quagmire, the ball
only moved a few yards. and a Union
forward walked in and scored an
easy goal. The winning goal was
scored on another freak play. as
goalkeeper Corrca attempted a
clearing kick, only to have the ball
bounce off a Union player into the
Albany net.

Coach Shalat commented. “It was
our mistakes rather than their play
which won game for Union.“ The
Albany strategy is the short passing
game, and the condition ofthe field
made this game plan impossible.
“The ball does not roll well on a
soggy ﬁeld with puddles in it. so our
players couldn‘t utilize their soccer
skills." said Shalat.

The loss dippedthe JV record to I-
5. Coach Shalut remarked. “We've
played much better than our record
indicates. as our efﬁciency has been
hampered by injuries and the loss of
our only goalkeeper for two games."
