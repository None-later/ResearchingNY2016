The Great Danes went into this
year's SUNY Athletic Conference
tennis tournament as the favorites to
defend the championship they've
held for the past two'years. But it just
wasn't meant to be. as a tenacious
Oneonta squad edged Albany to
capttne the conference title.

Oneonta outpointed the Danes

' 27-24, and Albany just narrowa
held onto second place. Binghamton
. came on strong in the tournament‘s
second day, but emerged in third
place just one point shy of Albany.

As far as individual titles go. the
Danes won four out of a possible
nine, and that was the best record
posted by any of the schools com-
peting.

Albany‘s Paul Feldman won the
number one singles title for the se-
cond year in a row. Feldman took
the championship fairly easily.
beating Binghamton’s Mark Peters
6-0, 7-5 in the semi-ﬁnals and then
trouneing Patti Vanaommer of

E

Oneonta by straight-set 6-l scores.
For Vansommer. it was his fourth
loss to-Feldman in two years, and the
aecondtime he‘scdropped the con-
ference title at the hands of the
Albany sophomore.
Commenting on the ease with
'which he won the ﬁnal match.
Feldman said, “When he walked on
the court. he looked beat. If you've
beaten a guy before and you beat
him big, it's got to have an effect on
him."

Mitch Sandler lost in last year‘s
final round to Binghamton‘s Eric
Rossum. but that didn't stop Sandler
from turning it around and beating
‘Rossum this year totakethe number
two singles title. Rossum extended
Sandler to three sets before succum-
bing by scores of 4-6, 7-5 and 6-2.

Sandler also teamed up with Feld-
man to take the number two doubles
title. That doubles tandem won its
championship by playing just two
matches. They were awarded a first-
round bye, and then won a quarter-

Danes' second singles Mlteh Sandler won the number two title 4-6, 7-
5, and 8-2 and teamed upwlth Paul Feidman to win the doubles crown.

Harriers Defeat Colgate;
Burns Win His Fourth

by Rich Sellgson

in a cross country meet which
featured two squads having unusual-
ly dismal seasons, the Great Danes
of Albany defeated Colgate 22-35 on
Saturday. But the main feature of
the meet was the horrible weather
conditions confronting both squads.
A continuous torrential downpour
plagued both teams. and only
Albany was able to emerge vic-
torious.

Coach Robert Munscy was not
surprised with his team’s success,
despite the poor weather. “There was
water everywhere, but they[Albany]
were ready. I can see they were com-
ing on in practice. They expected to
run well today."

Expecting and performing are two
different stories. The Danes per-

formed, and did not let nature stand
in their way. Especially Chris Burns.
He continued his outstanding run-
ning, and coasted to his fourth vic-
tory of the season, in 26:058.
Burns was only 40 seconds short
of the 5.15 mile course record.
Munsey commented. “It's silly to

say. but no doubt about it. with
better weather. Chris had the record
beaten."

Sophomore llill Fisher ran the
third fastest Colgate time ever.
finishing in second place, with a time
of 27: l 1. He was with llurnsthrough
the first two miles. but then the
Albany captain turned it on. to spark
him to his second consecutive win.

The "amazing" Matt Williams. as
he is called by Munsey, was by
himself most of the way. and came in
third place in 27:37. The Albany
coach summarized his race. “Matt
was under a lot of pressure being
alone; he had a lot of guts." Brian
Davis secured fourth place in 27:51.
running his best race of the season.
Mark Lavan and Mark Dalton rou-
nded out the Danes' top five scorers,
both ﬁnishing in under 28-minutes.

Munscy partly contributed
Albany's success to their practices.
“We have had brutal workouts the
past 2 weeks. It paid off yesterday."
The Danes have won their last three
meets against Colgate. narrowing

ﬁnal contest by default. The victory
represented their second doubles ti-
tle in two years.

Like Sandler, Albany's Phil
Aekerman also won his singles title
by defeating the man he'd lost to last
year. Aekerman held off a strong
challenge from Oneonta's Jeff Ratte
to win the number four singles divi-
sion. Ratte. who had beaten Aeker-
man earlier this season. lost a
squeaker by scores of 7-6 and 6-4.
However, Aekerman claims his
toughest match was his semi-ﬁnals
victory over number one seeded
Dave Freeman of Binghamton.

Fertig Tough in Defeat

Freshman Mike Fertig fought his
way to the ﬁnal round inthe number
five position, only to lose a see-saw
contest to Oswego‘s 'l‘im LaRosc, [-
6. 6—3, and 2—6. Albanytcam captain
Dave Denny had nothing but praise
for his freshman teammate. Denny
especially noted Fertig's tenacity in
coming back to win a semi-final
match late in the third set.

For Denny. the tournament was
somewhat of a disappointment. He
ran into difficulties in the third set of
his semi-final match against Scott
Leyton. The Oneonta doubles team
of Leyton and Vansommcr outlastcd
Denny and Aekerman in a two hour,
quarter-final doubles marathon.
Matt Reich and Andy Antosyk also
dropped :1 doubles contest to their
Oneonta opponents.

The key man for Oneonta was
Mitch Cohen. He was able to upset
number two seeded Matt Reich of
Albany. Cohen went on to win the
number six singles title. racking-up

unmatched tournament points for
Oneonta along the Way It was
Oncoma‘s consistency that allowed
them to dcthronc the (.ircat Danes.
Even though Albany won more lil-
dividual titles. none of Onconta‘s
players were eliminated before the
quarter-final rounds. Their three ti-
tlc victors combined with their four
runners-up to give Oneonta enough
points for a tournament victory.
Coach Bob Lewis of Albany
wasn't surprised at the loss. “i knew
it would be close." noted Lewis.
“because ofthe relative toughness of
the competition." The coach was

surprised. however. that it was
Oneonta and not llinghnmton who
beat his squad. Although Bingham-
ton was considered Albany's biggest
threat, two semi-final upsets at the
hands of Albany players made the
difference in Binghamton's modest
third place showing.

It wasn't surprising that the Great
Danes took Oneonta lightly. con-
sidcring the fact that they beat
Oneonta handily earlier in the
season. Sandler summed it up, "We
had the home court advantage. We
had everything going for us. But
Oneonta was super-psyched."

Boaters Cop Two; Oneonta Next

by Ed Maser

The Albany State soccer team
won two straight games this past
week to set up a crucial contest
tomorrow against Oneonta.
Wednesday Albany felled New l’altz
2-0, and Saturday the Hooters came
up with a 3-1 victory at rain-soaked
Union College. The two wins pushed
Albany over the .500 mark for on
overall record of 4-3-1.

After downing underdog New
l’aftz as expected. Albany head
coach llill Schicffelin stated, “if we
get by Union and beat Oneonta, we
still have an excellent chance to win
the conference championship." The
first part ofthttt aspiration came true
this weekend.

Albany now stands 2-l in its divi-
sion, with Cortland H). A win at
Oneonta will greatly enhance the

' Crﬁnlﬂ‘ﬁ

Booters‘ chances for a divisional and
conference title, as Cortland still
faces difficult games with both
Oneonta and Plattsburgh.

Albany is almost through the rou-
gh part of its schedule. After
Wednesday, the remaining four
games will be played at home. How
the hooters play in their final five
contests will determine whether or
not they recicvc a NCAA playoffbid
this year.

The U ttion field was a mess. to put
it mildly. from Friday's heavy rains.
'l'hc puddles of water and bogs of
mud that covered the playing surface
largely determined the outcome of
the game.

Albany's first score came after Un-
ion goalie Mikc Rektici had lunged
for and successfully snugng a kick-
ed ball. However, Rekaci found

himself sliding on the mud out ofthe
penalty area, and to avoid a direct
kick. desperately flung the bull in the
air. (Only inside the penalty markers
can a goalie hold the ball in his
hands.)

Albany's .lorgc Aguilar found a
round present land at his feet . Accor-
ding to Coach Sclticffclin, Aguilar
chipped the ball into the goal over
the outstretched arms of n surprised
Union fullback.

Minutes later, Matty Denora bcut
Rckaci his mobility hampered by
the quagmire fronting his net v on a
breakaway blast to make it 20.

ASP Cuts Loose From SA

Not haste in the heat of passion,
but the cold fiscal calculations of a
series of advertising managers since
l97| enabled the ASP to sever its
financial reliance on SA. Since then.
the newspaper's need for up-
propriations from SA have dwindled
from a high of 540,000 (out of a total
budget of $45,000) to last year‘s $6.-
000 appropriation in a budget of
about $70,000.

Paralleling the decrease of SA
funding was the rise in outside
revenue (the cold fiscal calculating).
In l97l. the paper, under the
leadership of Editor-in-Chicf Albert
Scnin and Advertising Manager Jeff
Rodgers. decided to give ad
salesmen (invariably Rodgers
himself) ten per cent ofthe aid money
in commissions. Revenue
quadrupled to over $40,000 within
three years. Later nd managers refin-
ed the policy. wliilc rcvcnue con-
tinticd to grow.

Money Rolls in

The editors, while the tnoney
rolled in. found enough reasons of
their own to look toward the day
when the paper could survive
without the ambivalent patriarchy of
SA. Each year, its SA used its
monetary power as a lever (once
physically chaini ngthc ll .S‘P's doors,
other times freezing its budget for
what it felt were journalistic im-
proprictics), the 1970 Freedom Ex-
press picked up momentum.

Although incidents such as the
door cittlining under former SA

President Mielutel Lampert have not
occurred lately. the potential arose
recently in 1975 over the issue of stu-
dent stipends in all SA groups. It was
the ASP's belief that much ofthe im-
petus for their slashed stipends was

the result of SA‘s discontent with an

to be vital to the paper‘s editorial
freedom. “When you ,liavcﬂa situa-
tion where a government hotly con-
trols the finances of the press."
Editor-in-Chicf Stephen Dzinnnku
said. "there exists the potential for
outside pressures to taint editorial

Only don't ask him to name you a
case where the ASP tainted its
editorial judgment. That would be
analogous to asking an cmbetzler to
itemize his income sources on his
chcrul l040 Long Form.

the stipend incident last year was the
“boot in the ass“ that helped the
paper to its goal of independence.

“independence should enhance the
paper‘s objectivity. Without any ties
to any specific interest groups. the
paper cancstnblish its credibility usa
campus publication rather than
simply a student organ.“ SA Vice
President (inry Parker. a supporter
of the independence drive. said “A
newspaper should not be dependent
upon student government as its

becomes a tool of government. It's

Most of the years of financial

Parker Impeachment Vote 

by Jonathan Hodges

Central Council. in a Wednesday
night meeting failed to pass a resolu-
tion calling for the impeachment of
SA Vice President Gary Parker.

The vote was recorded as Ill-l4
against impeachment with four
council members not in attendance
during the balloting.

Under the rules of impeachment
as stated in the SA Constitution. an
impeachment proposal requires a
three-quarters majority of the entire
thirty-one member Council to pass.
This means that twenty-three “yes”
votes must be ‘nst to gain an im-
peachment. Under the Constitution.
no abstentions are permitted.

Grounds Questioned

After lengthy questioning on the
mecting‘s procedual format,
members of the Pan-Caribbean
Association were asked to state their

other occupational hazards will lie
squarely on the newspaper. Plans to
incorporate by the end of November
will spread the risk of libel to the cor-
poration rather than on the Editor
alone. The burden of accuracy lands
also on the writers. who are after all
still students.

“The paper becomes more respon— .

siblc." Dzinanka said. “whatever the
definition of- rcsponsiblc is."

The Editor anticipates a successful
first year. “We hope to show a
minimum profit of $8,000 which will
be used to pay for our new produc-
tion cquipmcnt and cover otir sti-
pend linc. Anything more will be put
into a surplus to be used next year."

the guidelines set forth in the Inter-
nal Affairs Committee's resolution.

PCA members Jude Adjaye and
Tony Chch charged Parker with one
count of misfeasanoe and five counts
of malfeasance.

Outside Authority

Misfcasancc was defined as "per-
forming one‘s job incorrectly“ while
malfeasance is acting outside of
ones' authority.

Chch stated that PCA could have
charged Parker in Albany Criminal
Court with several Class A mis-
demeanors. criminnl violation and a
violation of the traffic code in
regards to the August 7 and ii con-
frontation between Parker and PCA
member Emeric llrowne-Mnrke.

The PCA explained that they had
chosen to tukcthc impeachment rou-
te in order to remove Parker from of-

f ice so he could never again practice
what Adjaye'termed, “Harrassment
and incompetence towards an SA
group." One charge that the PCA
highlighted was that when Parker
drove off with the SA van after his
encounter with Browne-Marke he
was not technically insured and if he
had been in an accident SA could
have been liable.

SA Researcher Desser Fired

by Jonathan Hodges

Paul Desser. SA research director
since the summer. was fired Wed tics-
day by SA President Steve DiMeo
immediately following the impeach-
ment hearing of SA Vice President
(iary Parker.

“It was basically a difference of
philosophy.“ said Dcsscr. “I have
always felt that a research director
should do research and then inter-
pret that research and pass along a
recommendation. DiMeo felt i
should just provide information."

When asked why he chose that
particular time to fire Desscr,
DiMeo replied. “it has nothing at all
to do with the impeachment issue.
This has been buildingsincc the mid-
dle of the summer.“

[lest Man

“Paul [Dcsser] told me that he
knew that he would be ﬁred if he
defended me." said Parker. who
shares an off-campus apartment
with Desser. “when I had
recommended Paul to Steve
[Di Meo] this summer. he had agreed
that Paul was the best man for the
job. i still think he is."

Desser's position as research

director is one of only a handful of

offices that make tip the executive
brunch. The other top SA positions
are the elected offices of the
Presidency and Vice Presidency and
the appointed positions of Con-
troller and Services Director.

'I‘wo Vacancies

The position of services director
has never been filled by the DiMeo
administration. With Desscr's
removal this leaves two vacancies in
the executive of SA.

“l‘ni suppose to serve at the
pleasure of the presidency," com-
mented Desser. “i guess ljust don't
please the president. That's why i
was fired."

“It probably startedthissummer,"
recalled Desser. “On many issues it
came down too ﬁght withGary andl
on one side and Nolan [Controller
Nolan Altman] and Steve on the
other. Everyone could feel the
schism. Wcjust couldn't bridge the
sun"

"Paul was one of the causes of the
walls that have been built around
SA." stated DiMeo. "Paul was

abrasive. He questioned the con-
troller‘s ability, saying Nolan wasn't
intelligent enough for the job. i felt 1
had to replace him."

Questioned if he was disenchanted
with SA, Desser responded. “I still
believe in SA. I‘ve already talked to
(ircg [Council Chairman Greg
Lessnc] over the possibility of join-
ing a standing committce. i hope to
see the projects I have helped start.
completed.”
