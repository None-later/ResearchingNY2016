“After the ﬁrst ﬁve or six votes
were cast. it was obvious Parker
wasn‘t going to be impeached." said
Council member Jonathan
Lafayette. “To vote yes on a losing
impeachment bill is tough. especially
when you have to work with him
[Parker] the rest of the year. That
could be reason why Cary and
Robyn left." ‘

“I'm just glad that it turned out the
way it did.” said Parker. “Now the
SA won‘t be burdened by this 'any
longer and we can get down and do
the work we were elected to do.“

SA President Steve Di Meo in
evaluating the repercussions of the

Asked if the PCA‘s charge that

true. DiMeo stated. “I have never

Roxanne. a senior biology major'

at SUNYA. said her academic ad-
visor is “very much involved with his

~research." At times. Roxanne said.

“I felt like I was being a bother."

Richard Hauscr. biology
professor who coordinates academic
advisement for his department. ad-
mitted that many biology depart-
ment faculty members came to the
university primarily to conduct
research and “incidentally to tetrch.“
“A good teacher who is doing good
research is the ideal,“ Hauser said.
and “with the pressures of teaching
and conducting research competing.
it is difficult to give attention to
lesser things.“

“1 his is a problem that isn't going
to go right away." Hattscr said. “Ad-

'vising is going to be secondary."

Althouin faculty members at
SUNYA are required to act as
academic atlvisors. such activity is
not lactorcd into calculations of
their \l orkload nor is it taken into ac-
count \vhcn considering personnel
actions (promotion. tenure. cori-
linucd appointment). according to
the 1975-70 Undergraduate
Academic Council‘s ad-hoc com-
mittee on advisement.

l‘hc committee's report states.
“the primary fact is that most in-
dividuals not specifically employed
to counsel students do not consider
the advising function a recognized

and rewarded part of the faculty

is seen as working “to the detriment

of advisement." according to the
report. “As long as the university
community believes that advising is
not taken into account in tenure
decisions. it will not receive the real
attention which it deserves," con-
cl udes the committee.

tives for the faculty to provide quali-

there should be. “some way of
evaluating their performance."

“I‘ve always been terribly concern-
ed about the quality ofour academic
advisement.“ says Ruth Schmidt.‘
dean of the humanities division. “l‘
think we could do more at this un-
iversity."

Schmidt says she feels that

workload."

“The heavy emphasis placed on
research and published scholarship“
ty academic advisement in t he face of
competing pressures of scholarship.
concerns many members of the un-
ivcrsity community.

The university needs to give
greater attention to a faculty
member‘s role as an advisor “in cott-
sidcring personnel actions." accor-
ding to acting vice president for

academic affairs David Martin.
Martin says he feels advisors should
be providing “available. adequate
somehow credit should be given to
the faculty for advisement. but she
would not create a separate category
in which to judge a person‘s role as
advisor as she considersthat “part of
the total teaching impact ol‘that per-
son."

The UAC's ad-hoc committee on
advisement concludes that “sortie

visement. . .should be instituted.
not only to improve the actual ad-
vising process. but also to
demonstrate that the universitycares
about advising and its quality.”
Although SUNYA President
Emmett B. Fields agrees that “ad-
visement tends to be given low
priority on the reward structure.“ be

said he feels that such a reward struc-.

inn: is not controlled by an in-
dividual university. but by the
academic world in general. Fields
said that the values of scholarship
and research are worldwide and that
to change the faculty reward system
on an individual university campus
would “work to the modification of
the entire culture."

Fields also said. “if an act belongs
on the priority scale at all. it ought to
be done and done well."

He said. however. that his views
do not preclude the possibility ol
beginning to modify the lactilty
reward system at SUN YA. and that

' such a change would be beneficial to

the advisement process.

In addition to the problem of
faculty incentives. the iJAC's rid-hoe
committee on advisement notes.
“cttrcertjob counseling is either mis-
sing or inconsistently offered" at
SUNYA.

Said Roxanne. “Supposedly there
is a place (for career counseling) in
the administration building. Ad-
visors don‘t seem to offer much
guidance as far as that goes.“

"I haven‘t looked. but I haven't
come across arty (earcer advise-
ment).“ said Sue. a senior English

aware of what is being done not";

‘The problem seems in be one of
coordinating several centeraj of
career advisement which now exist
within the university. “We've had a
great deal (of career advisement)."
says dean of student affairs Neil
Brown. “but we‘ve not coordinated it
very well."

Career advisement at SUNYA is
now conducted informally by some
academic advisers. and is available
through the placement office and the
university counseling center. “00ng
to the counseling center on this cam-
pus is not going to a shrink.“ says
llrown. although psychological
counseling is another of the services
it provides.

Sharing Resources

What is needed. according to
Martin. is a “sharing of resources."
Schmidt says she feels it would also
be helpful to “sensitize people on
campus who are in a position to help
students clarify their career goals“ to
the need for such advisement.

According to Fields. academic ad-
visement and career counseling
should go hand in hand. “Univer-
sities tended to let that counseling
that leads to acurriculum choice and
that counseling that leads to career
job placement he uncoordinated.“
says Fields. “'l'hat‘s kind of insane.“
he continued.

Fields says if a career decision is
made at the outset of the advisement
process. then a curriculum which fits
that choice most appropriately may
he designed.
