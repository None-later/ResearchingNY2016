Board rebate money from last
term which was never picked up by
students will go into a "general fund"
according to Norbert Zahm. General
Manager of the UAS.

“Most of the students who didn't
pick up the money must have
thought the amount was so negligi-
ble that it wasn't worth the trouble to
pick up the money. Only a couple of
dozen students had amounts coming
to them over 20 dollars." said Zahm.

A last effort was made this term by
UAS to give students back their
money. An ad was placed inthe A SP
requesting those students who
hadn’t picked 'up their rebate to fill
out a form so they would be able to
pick up the money due to them.

The deadline date for this form
was September 30.

Zahm said,“lt is no longer possi-
ble for students. who never filled out
a form to get a rebate. If they didn't
apply there is nothing much we can
do about it.“

Those who did fill out a form have
from October Is to the 29 to pick up
their check at check cashing.

Rebates were given out starting
last spring. Students were able to
pick tip a 4 per cent rebate on the
amount of money they paid on their

“About 400 students never picked
up the money. which totalled about
3.000 dollars.“ said James Trudeau.
Controller of UAS. As a
result. during the summer letters
were sent out to those students re-

~questing their addresses so the un-

iversity would be able to send them
their due checks.

Rebates were originally given
because “UAS was running ahead of
itself in their sales and was picking
up a net income greater than was ex-
pected.“ said Zahm. “We had a
choice to give it back tothestudents.
put it into a restricted fund for future
use. or use it for a particular function
this term." The decision was made in
favor of giving it back to the
students. because “it was felt that
this is what should have been done."
said Zahm.
