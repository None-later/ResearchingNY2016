By SUSAN E. MILLER

A small sign on the door reads
WORKSPACE. Behind the
storefront is a gallery created by and
for local artists. . I

Workspace is a loose organization
of artist-visual. musicians. dancers.
filmmakers and poets-who have
created an outlet for their work and
interested in a means of communica-
tion.

.Iacy Garret. a member since its in-
ception. said WORKSI’ACE started
spontaneously because there were.
“Feelings in the air. lts crcationcan't
be attributed to one individual.“ He
said similar groups have been es-
tablished in other parts of the coun-
try.

The storefront. built in mid June
at ll4B Quail Street. has been
transformed intoa one room gallery.

The walls are adorned with the
'works of Workspace members and
local artists. The shows run for ap-
proximately two weeks.

Spencer Livingston. a
WORKSI’ACE artist. said llcxibili-
ty is a key factor in all displays. The
length of each show can 'vary with
the individual artist's needs.

l’ast sltows have included
photographic displays. sculpture.
drawings. paintings and graphics.
The present show is Collaborative
Drawings by Joachim Frank. liach
work was jointly created by
Joachim. his family. and friends.

In addition to the art shows. an
open invitation poetry reading is
held at the storefront every other
Wednesday night at 8:00 pm. All are
welcome to read original poetry.

Criticism is offered occasionally
but Garret explained. "Criticism is
not the main purpose and we do not
want it to resemble astudent-tcachcr
relationship.

WORKSI’ACIZ maintains a se-
cond office at N Central Avenue.
Thethird-story lol't housesa library.
music studio. performingarca. office
and publicity center. Jau concerts
and film shows by local artists are
being planned for the near future.

In all of their activities. members
stress a notion ol'eommunity. l‘herc
are no official titles or positions of
authority and all decisions are made
collectively.

Each Sunday at 8:00 pm. an open
tnccting is held. Everyone is welcome
to contribute ideas to scheduling.
publicity. and all decisions.

lltc notion of communin is in-
herent In all WORKSI’ACE
endeavors. WORKSI'ACE is fund-
ed solely by public donations.
Donations are recent-d at perfor-
mances and members are asked to
make a voluntaty contriluttion. lbe
monthly pledge is a method for
generating a dcpcndablc budget to
coicr basic expenses.

“'I here is no deluution of
membership." explained livingston.
Many members are acti\e inall areas
while ol hers arc cxclusncly lll\ o|\cd
with displayng then works.

Steady membership tluctuates
between ttltcen and l\\t.'lll\. (iarret
said. "In that sense \u' are still
struggling We need people to per-
form. plan ewnts and pi'tntdc an
audience,"

||\ttigston Iccls he has bencltted

Community Workspace

tremendously from beinginvolved in
WORKSI’ACE. He explained. “Ar-
tists often work in isolation. The in-
teraction and exchange of ideas

provides a broader experience than ‘ I

working alone.“ He. like other
members. feels a sense of communi-
ty.

“l didn‘t see much future for
mysell as an artist." commented
Garret. “Workspace has helped
break barriers I have set up for
myself.“

Hob Darlak. another member.
believes. “Working together collec-
tively. as artists. is a breakthrough."

    

   

He feels Workspace has potential

beyond traditional art marketcering.
A bi~weekly newsletter listing

events and ideas is a 'ailable upon re-

quest.

DAYS OF
THE CONDOR

Anemic scxlcssness and musical
purity aren‘t synonymous.

Redding and David Clarke. whose
alter ego is that of a professional
mathematician. are responsible for
most ofthe material. Eventbeir song
titles aredullr “Hold ()n."“Yes. It‘s
All Right." “I'm Just a Sinner.“ The
band is lackluster enough. though.
so that the absence of good material
doesn‘t really affect the album much.
“You Make Me Feel So Good"
might have been a decent filler if it
weren't for Redding‘s singing. He
finds a nice acoustic riff. and the
lazy. heavily phased drumming of
Leslie 'l'. Sampson creates a warm
swirl of sensations. A subtle piano
fades in and out in the background.

But it's only one riff. which leaves a
lot of leftover space on this album.

He called it Blowin' so he must
have known he was asking for trou-
ble. This is a pretty depressing effort
because Noel is old and he used to be
good. Anyway. one ofthethingsthat
makes rock & roll such a thrill is that
tltere are such high places to fall
down out of. The pun intended here.
obviously. is that Noel Redding
makes a crash landing.
