The theme of a recent Classical
Forum was imaginative ancient
biographies. or rather imaginative
items found in many ancient
biographies. Another Classical
Forum. published last year. men-
tioned the story of George
Washington and the cherry tree. in-
vented by I’arson Wecms and in-
serted into his biography of
Washington. Parson Weems may
not have realized that he was using
an ancient technique for enhancing
his stibject and teaching a moral
lesson at the same time.

Francis Glass in his biography of
George Washington was very con-
scious of his debt to Romanauthors.
He composed his biography in
Latin. Glass. a Classical scholar and
teacher. had a great ambition in life.
namely. to write in Latin a vim
"biography" of (ieorge Washington.
whom he considered "the greatest
man who had ever lived.“ 'I'his ambi-
tion he was able to fulfill. for he did
compost: his vita. probably finishing
it in lll24. One of his students.
Jeremiah N. Reynolds. edited the
manuscript after the death of (ilass
and published the work in l835 and
“536. A “literary” notice of the
biography. a notice written by
Reynolds. announced that the book
was intended for use in colleges and
seminaries. and was expected to in-
terest young students and especially
American readers because of its
treatment of relatively recent events.
The search for relevance is not new!

In his introduction. also written in
Latin. Glass is modest about his
ability to perform the task he has set
himself, but claims that Washington
in the highest degree deserves to have

DonaldAReeb about Ihrfdte ofihe university.
Gaines: Comidcring President Fields' mission
study, program cutbacks and reallocation
docilionl, in what direction are we going?

Rub: . . .Awhnt we-hitve become in the past

’ ten years is a university without a constituen-

cy ;_. . Vice President David Martin
develdpcd a few years ago statistics that
showed . . .wc draw from every county in
about the same proportion as the population
ofthat county. We don't even have a clientel or
constituency by area. let alone by subject
matter. ‘
Gaines: Would you put a value judgement on
that?
Reeb: It puts us in a very vulnerable postion,
and I think that's what we're sceingtoday. We
have seen that the central administration can
bring in a relatively strong-minded person. ad-
vise him and direct him to make certain kinds
1 of changes here, and that we find nobody from
around the state, no senator and no
assemblyman. rising up and saying ‘no, you
can‘t do this‘, nor no group of fathers and
mothers. Our constituency istoo fragmented.
Gaines: When Fields says we are “too thin“,
isn‘t he trying to deal with the fact of fewer
resources? Do we have fewer resources?
Reel): No we don‘t. We have absolutely more
dollars than we had before . . .
Gaines: If you were to say that the added
number of professors that Wcrc needed in
departments that had huge student demand.
like business.werc necessary . . . we do have
to take away a few i'. om everyone else.
Reel): Of course we do. But there is a big tur-
nover on this campus. as there is every carti-
pus. Fields announced at the fall meeting of
the faculty that ol or 62 new faculty members
were hired onthis campus. Now. ontheface of
that. it's hard to say he doesn't have enouin

 :NYA’s Milton

flexibility to swuch faculty lines from Speech

Therapy to something or other . . . it'I
strange that he chose to eliminate program
when he could have gotten the ﬂexibility he
iieeded by merely tramferinglinea. And that in
itself is hard to explain . . .I don‘t undert-
tand why he would choosetotake on the anger
of the faculty in that method rather than just
eliminating a line in one department that was
becoming vacant and transfering it tounothcr.
He could have done it.

Gainer: Wasn‘t his reasoning that he couldn‘t
get enough lines that way?

Reel): But he only got rid of 22. supposedly.
this year. and hired 62. So he obviously had40
lines of flexibility—how much more does he
need in one year?

Gaines: What did he do withthat unnecessary
flexibility?

Ree/r: The unnecessary flexi bility is still sitting
there. We‘ve still got excess lines on cam-
pus . . . the rumor is that (there are many
lines unfilled) . . .

Gainer: What is Fields looking for?

Real); I don‘t know what he‘s looking
for . . . part of'the feeling isthat we are be-
ing used by the central administration. that is
Boyer and the Board of Trustees. to placate
the legislature by saying: ‘ok. we‘ll do some of
your studies for you.‘

Gaines: Do you think Fields looks at it that
way'!

Ravi): Well. there is a question as to where he is
getting his direction. He didn't come into
Albany State. and suddenly off'the plane here
say: 'Wow! What a public policy place this is
going to niake!‘

(iaintu‘: He did want to ‘take advantage of‘ihe
surroundings'.

Rev/i: Someone must Iiave primed him on that
bcl ore he came off I lie plane. Who's priming. I
don't know.

(iuinm: He said when he came here as a Cfln-
didate that iriends of his had commented:

Pres. Mondale. I .
By Default?

by Todd Miles

For those of us who have suffered through
two debates between the Presidential con-
tenders. laughing with Carter as Ford
mumbled his prepared statistics and glaring
with Ford as Carter drawlcd his morality ser-
mons. tonight's televised confrontation
between the vice-presidential candidates
should prove entertaining. ‘

Any standards of intelligence andeloquence
would indicate that Walter Mondale and
Robert Dolc should be running for President.
Each man is engagingand witty. capable ofar-
ticulating his philosophy withster and force.

Both Mondale and Dole have distinguished
records in public' office. Mondale served as
Minnesota‘s Attorney General before becom-
ing that state‘s Junior Senator. In
Washington. he learned the ropes from his
close friend and colleague. Sen. Hubert
Humphrey. Mondale has earned top liberal
ratings from such orgainlations as Common

Cause and, the American Civil Liberties Un-
ion.

On the other hand. Dole has championed
the conservative cause in the Senate and serv-

, ed as Republican National Chairman from

I973 to I975. He is reputed to be a tough. tiar-
castic campaigner. Included in his repertoire
of one-liners are zingers such as: “Pineapple
juice is better than peanut butter. it doesn't
stick to the roof of your mouth."

In a campaign such as this year's.
characterized by Jimmy Carter's lust and
Jerry Ford‘s total statistical recall. tonight‘s
debate may be the high point. With three
weeks left in the campaign. there is one nnssi-
ble result which is improbable. but most
desirable. Suppose nobody votes for either
Ford or Carter, and Walter Mondale becomes
our 38th President by default? In any case.we
seemed destined to get a President of vice-
presidential caliber. and a Vice-President
smarter than his‘boss.
