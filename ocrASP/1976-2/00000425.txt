The Albany State Golf Team clos-
ed out the I976 fall season last week
with a 5th place finish in the

team field battled over a tough
Cooperstown golf course. with 0s-
wego runningawaywithtop honors.

On the individual level. the Danes
were led by John Ammerman‘s 80.
Other than that. there was hardly
anything representing good golf.
The team's consistent leader. Mike
Dulin, shot an 85, and -Rick Porter
(ECAC Spring I975 Champ) blew
up to a 90. Dick Derrick had an 86.
Jim McKilIipshot 87. and Frank See
came in with an 88. -

“The dinner they served Sunday

 

night was awful." said See, who got
sick during the first round but finish-
ed out. Coach Saucrs probably got
sick too. but not from the food.
Albany‘s 426 5-man total gave the
Danes 51h place by one stroke over

Plattsburgh. Oswego shot 382. a’76.4
average. Brockport had a 80.4. Cor-
tland shot 81.4 and Oneont'a came in
with a 84.0. Fredonia and New Palm
rounded out the ﬁeld.

In reflection. Albany seemed to
consistently improve as the season
wore on. They opened with a loss to
Siena. but came in 4th in the two in-
vitational tournaments that follow-
ed. beating Siena in their own
tourney. 'I'he Danes then lost to a
good Oneonta team by Is strokes.
but vowed to cut that down by
season‘s end. The team then reeled
offthree straight victories. over New
I’altz. llartwick. and Williams.

State entered the SUNYAC with
confidence and momentum. but
faltcred and just beat out
I’Iattsburgh. who had led the Danes
in the Cardinallnvitational. They
also cut that margin between
themselves and Oneonla by 9
strokes. It all shows something for a
team that has the potential to go all
the way when spring blooms again in
I977.

l‘rank Sclca will agree. “I was
never happier in my life. I ran
around kissing everybody after the
game."

No question about it. that game
was big. But Albany still has four
games remaining—all home—and
must win all to gainany shot at post
season play. I’Iattsburgh will behere
Wednesday for the first of those
four. and it is up to the Iiootcrs to
prove that Wednesday's game was
no l'luke.
