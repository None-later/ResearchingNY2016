NEW YORK (AP) Chris Chambliss

- walloped a ﬁrst-pitch home run in

' the bottom of the ninth inning
I Thursday night to give the New York

Yankees a 7-6 victory over the Kan-
sas City Royals and the American
League pennant.

Chambliss‘ dramatic blow, which
overcame a dramatic game-tying
three-run homer by the Royals‘
George Brett in the cighthinning. set
off a wild demonstration on the ﬁeld
at remodeled Yankee Stadium as a
record crowd of 56.821 celebrated
the Yankees' 30th American League
flag and their first pennant in 12
years.

Chambliss, who had driven intwo
runs and scored another earlier.
stood at the plate to watch his blast
soar towards the right centerﬁeld
stands. As it dropped majestically
into the seats. the husky first
baseman thrust his arms in the air
and the stadium exploded with the
roars of the crowd.
