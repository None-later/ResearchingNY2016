half.

The Red Dragons attempted to
get the equalizer. but were thwarted
constantly as Albany dumped the
ball into the Oneonta zone. The
hosts “didn‘t really have tougher
shots; 1 think the half was pretty
evenly played,“ said Schieffelin.

Both Matty Denora and Arango
came up with good scoringloppor-
tunities in the half, but Harrington
came up with the savesfthe first
straight—on, the second. on a dive.

Oneonta outshot Albany |0-6 at
the half and had only four saves as
opposed to seven by Dunc goalie
Darie Arango.

In the second half. Oneonta's
John Cowens had the first big scor-
ing chance. when he came up with
the ball off a scramble in front ofthc
Albany net. But his hard boot hit the
crossbar and bounced off.

Three minutes later. at the llzltl
mark. Albany scored again—this
time on even more of a ll tike than the
first goal. l'lalfback Paul Schiesel
came down the right side and booted
a shot that bounced off Oneonta
defenseman Byron Cordcro and past
a sliding Harrington. into the net.
Albany now led. 2-0.

Ten minutes later. Schiesel was
again involved in a goal. Breaking

Aldo Sergovich took the shot
from Ill yards out. First he faked to

almost to the center of the net.
Harrington never had a chance.
With 22:25 left. the Danes now led 3-

Ford on Cortland: ‘Should Be

by Craig Bell

The Albany State Great Danes
football team clashes with the ex-
plosive Cortland State Red Dragons
Saturday at University Field, and
only one team will come away with
the bragging rights as the best team
in the SUNY system.

Both teams have beaten the
Brockport and Plattsburgh teams in
the past and now are on a collision
course for the ﬁrst time.

“It should be a great challenge"
said Great Danes head coach Bob
Ford. “Year in and year out Cor-
tland is considered to be the best
SUNY school, in addition to playing
one of the toughest schedules in divi-
sion lll."Their tough schedule is one
reason Ford warns not to be fooled
by their 2-3 record.

The Red Dragons‘claim to fame is
a very highvpowcred offense. The
defense, while not an outstanding
unit, has a great amount of ex-
perience and is a solid group.

The Cortland offensive machine is
“just awesome." according to Ford.
Theyrun out of a multiple of sets and

their offensive line is huge. sporting
tackle: that are 6'4" and 6'3" and 240
pounds each.

Cortland‘s offensive line will be
opening holes for the best back the
Danes may face all year. Lyle
Schuler. Schuler is an excellent
runner, according to the coaching
staff. He has the strength to run in-
side and the speed to be a constant
threat on the outside all day long. So
far this year. he is averaging a bun-
dred yards a game and he amassed
130 yards against lthaca College.

Besides Schuler. the Danes are go-
ing to have to worry about quarter-
back Ralph Boettger who. two
weeks ago against Central Connec-
ticut. threw for 325 yards. Boettger
will be tough to defend against
because he throws to so many
different receivers.

Another problem the Danes will
have to contend with if they are to
shut down this aerial show, is the fact
that Boettger can throw offso many
types of movement. In addition to
dropping back, Boettger likes toroll.
sprint, use play-action. hit you with
the quick pop, and attack .the
backside with a bootleg.

After dipping into his bag of tricks
and throwing the ball, Boettger has
quite an assortment of receivers to
choose from. One of his favorite is

6‘4" 2|5 lb. tight end Rich Arden.
Ardcn‘s physical size alone will pre-
sent enough of a problem. Then
there is speedy split end Tom Cum-
mings. "Cummings has it all," said
Ford. “He's got the hands. the moves
and the speed. He is an excellent
receiver.“

Ford expects Cortland to try to
take advantage of their superior size

tallied Oneonta‘s initial score. Rich

thwarted on a leaping save by

just nudged it into the wide-open net.

the play seemed over when Arango

out of the goulie‘s grasp and Keith

“It will be quite achallenge to try

“Anytime you beat Oneonta at

Schieffelin exclaimed. “Now the

our spirits are high."

New Members Named
To Serve 0n UAS Board

by Jonathan Hodges

New appointees to the University
Auxiliary Services Membership
Board were named early this week.
UAS, a not-for-profit corporation
with a multi-million dollar budget,
will select its board of directors in its
first fttll meeting next Tuesday.

The membership board of UAS is
responsible for selecting the cor-
poration‘s board of directors, which
determines UAS policy. The
membership board is also responsi-
ble for the revision of the cor-
poration‘s by-laws and the final ap—
proval of the budget.

The membership board is com-
posed of l7 students. four ad-
ministrators. seven faculty and one
class of‘76 member. All faculty and
the one alumnus are automatically
elected to the board of directors.
The remainder of the 20 director
board is filled out by ten of the un-
dergraduate students and two ofthc
administrators.

The students of UAS were all ap—'
pointed by SA President Steve
DiMeo. From this list hischoices for
the board of directors are: Steve
DiMeo. Gary Parker. Nolan Alt-
man, Greg Lessne, Cary Klein. Dan
Gaines, Rich Greenberg. Bob Freed-
man, Anne Markowitz, David Gold.
Michael Lissner. Katie MacGowan.
Jim Aronoff, Andrea Greger. Jon

Lafayette. Paul Rosenthal and Mark
Sass.

The faculty members are:
Franklin Walker, Charles Heller,
Donald Arnold. Donald Bourque.
Bruce Gray, Mina LaCroix and
Arthur Collins.

The administrative represen-
tatives are Emmett Fields and Pat
Buchalter. Both Vice President Har-
tigan and Dean Brown are required
to be on the board of directors by
UAS by-laws. g

The alumni member selected frotn
the Class of ‘76 Alumni Board is lra
Birnbaum.

New By-laws

This year. UAS will be operating
under a new set of by-laws adopted
last May to comply with guidelines
set forth by SUNY Clntnccllor
Ernest Boyer. According to the new
guidelines. UAS must have an equal
number of students and non-
students on its board of directors.

Last year UAS (formerly known
as the Faculty-Student Association.
FSA) was controlled by a board of
directors that contained a student
majority. These students voted out
FSA President John llartley, former
vice president of management and
planning. and placed SA Controller
Stu Klein at the head ofthc corpora-
tion.

After Boyer's new guidelines were

issued last year. Klein used the stu-
dent majority advantagc to pass a
new set of by-laws that complied
with the guidelines yet maintained ti
de-facto majority.

Last year‘s SA President Andy
Bauman stated that a student ma-
jority on the UAS Board of Direc-
tors was only right, based on the fact
that the students provide 90 per cent
of UAS‘s income. Bauman said that
he would take the issue to court to
defend the student majority.

This year‘s SA President Steve
DiMeo said. “Basically. the need for
a majority is not all that great. We‘re
dealing with reasonable people on
both the faculty and the administra-
tion.“

Dan Gaines. a student appointed
to the membership board, disagrees.

Mission Critique Drafted

by Ed Moser

Administrators in the Department
of Student Affairs are in the process
of preparing a response to the sec-
tion in President Fields' Mission
statement that deals with the goals
and objectives of student develop-
ment.

The draft. according to Dean of
Student Affairs Neil Brown. will
help lay the philosophical founda-
tion of the three-year development
programs President Fields ltas re-
quested from Student Affairs and

    

from every other administrative
unit.

The three-year plan calls for each
department to establish its goals. ob-
jectives. priorities and level of
resources in accordance with the un-
iversity mission.

Student Affairs‘ draft supports
significant portions of the Mission
statement. However. it reads,“we
have identified elements
which...need to be clarified, refocus-
ed, developed in greater detail, or
even eliminated. Our major concerns

focus upon Part lll: Goals and 0b-
jectives for Student Development."

Dr. Welty, director of residences.
said it was too early for Student Af-
fairs to spell out how its desired aims
will be implemented. Dean Brown
agreed, calling the draft an“evolving
document" in a continual state of
revision.

Dean Bro'wn did say the draft's in-
tent will lead to a “much greater
emphasis on work development and
career counseling."

Describing the way in which
students now select a career as
“happenstance”. Brown cited a need
for “well-established programs
which encourage students to think
about personally satisfying careers
much earlier in their academic ex-
perience.“

Brown added that the draft calls
for greater interaction among the
faculty. administration and student
body.

The Mission statement said the
University should concentrate on in—
tellectual development. slitting this
area to be one in which the U niversi-
ty is “best qualified.“ Student Affairs
responded by stating that social,
emotional and physical concerns are
equally important to the develop-
ment of a student's make-up as a
whole. Deatt Brown called the
difference between the two view-
points a “deep philosophical issue."

Brown said that in two or three
weeks a clearer picture would
emerge of the policies needed to ac-
complish Student Affairs' goals. He
emphasized that students should
become more involved in the ongo-
ing debate about the Mission

“I wish DiMeo thought that a stu-
dent majority on the board of direc-
tors was essential rather than just
convenient."

“Evcn though the students
probably do have atechnical majori-
ty on the board of directors. i don‘t
foresee any real problems." said Vice
President for Business and Finance
John Hartigan. Hartigan and Dean
of Student Affairs Neil Brown are
the two administrative directors. “I
think we have both reasonable and
responsible students,“ Hartigan add-
ed.

On paper. the students no longer
maintain a majority on the board.
However. they still hold a solid ma-
jority on the membership board,
which elects UAS__offtcials.

“Steve lDiMeo] has already nam-
ed Paul Rosenthal as his choice for
UAS President.“ said UAS student
member Greg Lessne. “While
theoretically the membership board

'elects the president, I can‘t imagine

Paul not getting elected."
According to a number of
students on the membership board.
this year UAS will beconcerned with
maintaining and improving present
services as Well as researching the
possibility of offering new services.

Educational

UAS is responsible fora variety of
university services, amongthem the
quad cafeterias. the Rat hskeller, the
billiards room. the barbershop and
the check cashing service.

New Services

“I'd like to see a number of new
services begun,“ said David Gold. is
UAS student member. “I'd like to see
the hot breakfast extended to II
a.m.. a student discount
provided in the Patroon
Room andlook into the possibility of
allowing the Food Co-op toexpand
into the Shirt Shop."

"I‘d like to see some of UAS sur-
plus money going to the proposed
student recreational center," said
Di Meo. “Of course. i would also like
to see the cost 'of student board re-
main the same."

UAS President designate
Rosenthal said. “i cenainly think
both check cashing and the Patroon
Room could be put to better use as
well as existing services improved."

When asked how he felt about us-
ing UAS surplus for the recreational
center, Rosenthal said, “It's unfor-
tunate that the State University
system felt itcouldn‘t afford it, butat
least part of the surplus should be
allocated for the center.“
