r- Brothers don't set their lives aside to DO any one thing,

 



It takes a lot to be a“pro','.whetherat sports.téacbing, or

whatever. You have to do more than just know your
stuff. You have to center your whole life around what

you are expert at. And, when you're a "pro", you pt to

be known for what you‘retopa at. The first thing people

think of when they see you is. “He's a doctor...or

lawyer...or baseball player.

It‘s the same deal with the Marist Brothers. only
but to IE something. Marist Brothers do all sorts of
professional tasks - teaching. counseling. social work,
child care, retreat work. health care, campus ministry.

But all Marist Brothers, no matter what they do, are
“pros” at one thing: being Brothers.

Marist Brothers are full-time what the Church is: a
brotherhood of people who love Christ and who are
spreading His message ‘round the world.

Marist - different where it counts.

What Is the slgrlfleanee fo the
swine flu virus?

The newly identified swine ﬁrus.
designated A/New Jersey/76 (st
lNl). represents a major change
from viruses which are currently cir-
culating in the human population.
Since it has the capacity to spread
from person to person, it could
develop into it pandemic strain and
ctiusc extensive illness and death.
Although on influenza virus ’ofswine
has been known as the cause of ii-
lness in swine for many years. the

Fort Dix outbreak is the first known
example in the United States since
about I930 of person-to-person
transmission to that of swine.

What relationﬂp does tlds swine
vim have to the lQlBinﬂuensa pan-
demlc‘.’

Influenza viruses were first
isolated from man in the early
1930‘s. We can only speculate about
the characterisitics of the viruses
prevalent before that time. Testing
of blood of individuals who were liv-
ingin l9|8 shows almost all haverin-
tibodies to swine-like virus. This
suggests that a virus of this sort may
have caused the l9l8 pandemic.
Such antibodies are also found in
many persons over the age of 50.

suggesting that a swine-like virus
was widespread in human pop-
ulations. perhaps up to I930.

How was the l9]! Inﬂuenza pan-
demic dfferent from other Influenza
pandemles? - ,

It was unique because of its high
mortality. and the fact that so many
of the fatalities occurred among ap-
parently healthy young men and
women. It is estimatcdthat the I9I8-
I9 pandemic resulted in a world-
wide death toll of more than 20

~million, with half a million of the

fatalities occurring in this country.
There iskhowever. no evidence to in-
dicate that the virus recently iden-
tified at Ft. Dix has the some
characteristics of virulence as the
l9l8 virus.

Illasnas unison-minutiae ’

It has been demorltrated that the
iriitisl outbmak of swine int‘luenzeat
Ft. Dix was fairly extensive.
Although only l2 cases. have been
conﬁrmed. extensive blood testing
has indicated that several hundred
recruits were probably infected dur-
ing this outbreak. No spread to the
nearby civilian New Jersey popula-
tion has been demonstrated. Hun-
dreds of blood samples of in-
dividuals from various sections of
the country have been tested. As ex-
prected. approximately 80 per cent
of people over the age of 50 have
swine-like virus antibodies in their
blood. although not enough to
assure adequate protection. Some
individuals below the age of 50 also

have antibodies to swine virus.

Hchver. no additional instances of
pcrson-to-pcrson transmission

Recently'eomplcted ﬁeld trials

cent of persons over age 24 respond-
ed well to even the lowest dose of
vaccine tested. While persons l8
through 24 had less favorable

response. the trials showed that .-

uround 85 per cent of persons in this
age group can expect to develop
some immunity following a single
dose of vaccine. Additional trials,
now underway. are expected to
determine a satisfactory dosage level
for children and the advisability of a
second dose of vaccine for persons
under age 25.
