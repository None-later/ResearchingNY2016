 king-about.“ in totals of
seven games.-the full liinit. _ ,
Now with the National League
charhpions comfortsth ahead of the
. New York Yankees with twostr’aight
victories, might Anderson be
.tempted to alter his prediction?

No sir.

“I'll stick with seven." the Reds
skipper said Monday as the two
teams prepared for Tuesday night's
third game at Yankee Stadium. “Un-
til you ﬁnish something, stick with
the long way.”

Having delivered that axiom.
Chairman Sparky added another.

“The Yankees are anexcellent ball
club. They've won three or four in a
row before and there‘s no reason that
they can't beat the Reds four
straight," he said.

Billy Martin. manager of the

Yankees, liked that idea.
' “I think Sparky‘s right," said Mar-
tin. “We're the kind of team that can
win, four straight. We've done it
before and we could again."

But Anderson had a distinct smile
on his face when he suggested that
the Reds could be overtaken with a
sudden Yankee four-straight tur-
naround. 

“lfthey beat us four straight now,"
he said. “I'll be the most shocked
man in the world.“

“Pat Zachary got the third
pose starting” assignment for the
Reds auitlt Doc Ellis of the
Yankees. '

For Zachry. it was the realization
of a boyhood dream, but in reverse.
Growing up in Waco, Tex.. he had
always hoped to become a major
leaguer and play in Yankee Stadium-
for the home team. -

"It will be something special for
me to pitch in this ball park." said the
24-year old right-handt', who had a
14-7 record in his ﬁrst major league
season.

“The Yankees were always my
favoi‘ite team when l.was growing
up," he‘said. “I'd go in the back yard
with a plastic ball and bat and make
believe I was pitching and the
Yankees were playing. I knew their
line-up. all the positions,everything.
Andwhen I played, the Yankees won
every game, 15-0.“

Why would a youngster growing
up in Te‘xas root for the Yankees?

"They had such an array of stars. I
guess everybody rooted for them."
said Zachry.

Anderson could understand that.

“I was the same way. growing up,"

 

 

 

   
      
     
 

said Sparky. ‘I signed with the
I Brooklyn Dodgers in 1953. but I
have to admit I rooted for the
Yankees to beat them in the World
Series that year." -

Those were the years when the
Yankees were regular World Series
participants. In 1953, but I have to
admit I rooted for the . Yankees to
beat them in the World Series that
year.”

Those were the years when the '
Y .nkees were regular World Series
participants. In 1953. they beat I
Brooklyn in six games. The year
before, it took them seven. In that
one. the hero was a brash second
baseman who made a dashing catch
on a bases-loaded POP "Yby Jackie
Robinson in the final game. His
name? Billy Martin.

“Those Yankee teams were
awesome," said Martin.

And does he think the Reds are
awesome?

“No. they're good. butthcy‘rc not
awesome." he said.

And what would make them
awesome?

“Win five straight World Series-

then you're awesome." said Martin.
