Can Clear The Bases

CINCINNATI (AP) For pure. cold
efﬁciency. it's hard to beat Tony
Perez.

“I just like to hit withrnen on base,
especially with money on the line."
said the 34-year old Cincinnati
slugger whose ninth-inning two-out
single propelled Reds to a 4-3 victory
Sunday night for a 2-0 lead in the
World Series.

Perez, the most prolific RBI
producer in baseball over the past l0
years, went to the plate looking fora
fastball from New York Yankees'
right-hander Catﬁsh Hunter.

“The last three times up he got me
out with a high fastball. I was look-
ing for it again," said Perez, who
now has six hits, erasing the sour
memory of an 0-l5 Series slump a
year ago and a 1-18 effort in I970.

Teammate Joe Morgan, who was
intentionally walked prior to the
game-winning hit saluted the gentle
Cuban with Ultimate praise.

“I wanted to hit. But I was glad he
was up there. Perez is the best clutch
hitter in baseball." said Morgan, of
the 12-year veteran who is the only
man in baseball to drive in 90 or
more runs in each of the past [0
years.

The game-clinching hit came in
bone-chilling weather and cooled
down a red-hot Hunter, who had
things well in hand from the fourth
inning on.

Morgan said the Reds beat
Hunter. their I972 World Series
nemesis, at his best.

ninp, Catfish was better than the
Catfish of I972.“ Hunter, alive-time
20-game winner, beat the Reds twice
in that Series to launch the Oakland
A's three-year reign as world cham-
pions.

Ken Griffey, who dashed home
from second on the single to left by
Perez, shook his head in quiet
amazement.

“He's something else. It seems like
every time I get on second in that
situation, he gets me in."

Asked if he thought the Yankees
could win four of the next five games

'to stop the Cincinnati bid for a

repeat title, the young right ﬁelder
paused and grinned.

“Being down two, I don't think
they can.“

The last American League team to
come from a 2-0 deﬁcit was the I958
Yankees. who erased a CH disadvan-
tage to Milwaukee by sweeping the
last three. .

   

Captain Chuck Rappazzo added
the conversion points by booting the
ball through the uprights. boosting
the Albany lead to 6-0. '

The second half was a lackluster
performance forbothtearns as State
continually allowed Union to pt out
of trouble. Successful Albany
penetrations were stymied as Union
fullback. kicks would thwart State
scoring attempts.Albany had an ex-
cellent opportunity to run up the
score, as Union could not mount an
offensive and was constantly pinned
in their own territory.

Albany had another opportunity
to score in the second half as the
serum managed to move the ball
down to the Union goal line. Dumas
ran the ball in. but was unable to
touch it down for the try as he was
surrounded by Union defenders.

During the entire second half, Un-

ion escaped trouble by fine fullback
kicking and .Albany penalties.
However. Union's defensive

Albany co-captain Niall McStay
commented, “The serum over-
powered and out-ﬁnessed Union.
and Albany was the better team on

with the ruggers' performance. ad-
ding, "Albany showed a ﬁne running
attack and superior ability and
knowledge of the game. In the game,

Manhattan.
