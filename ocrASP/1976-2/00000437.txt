Albany. meanwhile..was piling up

let Cortland receive the second half
kick-off. After the game. Ford said
he had hoped his team would “hold

Harriers Finish In Fourth Place
At SUNYAC Championship

by lid Matter

The Albany State barriers ﬁnished
fourth of nine teams Saturday in the
SUNYAC Cross-Country Cham-
pionship at Oswego. Chris Burns of
Albany ran the 5.0 mile course in
25.02. third among 86 ﬁnishers. to
earn his second All-Conference
berth.

The meet was a relatively bright
spot in what has turned into a disap-
pointing season for Albany track.
Coach Keith Munsey. while com-
plaining he lacks depth and "the
horses to ﬁeld a great team". said on
the basis of Saturday's results. his
barriers were “running almost as
well as they‘re capable of run-
ning . . . up to 95 percent of
capacrty.“

Munsey was similarly bittersweet

A spread offiftyseconds lay between

had some five miles to spread
themselves over.

But two dozen opponents ﬁnished
between third placer Burns and
Albany runners Mark Lavan. Eric
Jackson and Davis. who came in 23.
24 and 26. respectively. (Freshman
Matt Williams was 18th in 25:44).

The latter three were "skech as
on the wrong end of a curve," suid
Munsey. “Chris Burns was at one
end ofthc curve. the rest at the other
end." The result was Albany trailed

runners finished in a block ahead of

Williams. by just twelve points.

Munscy had no illusions of"

challenging the first and second

Fredonia. “We couldn‘t have beaten
them." he stated flatly.

Chris Burns traded the lead with
Fredonia‘s Roger Carroll

the Fredonian‘s sprinter-like kick.

Netters Beat Guard

by Kevin Kelton

The men's tennis team capped off
a very successful fall season this past
Wednesday by winning their final
dual match of the year. The win
preserved Albany‘s undefeated dual
match record of seven victories in the
past five weeks.

The Danes finished the season in
grand style by trouncing Coast
Guard, 8-1. The contest wasevery bit
as lopsided as that score suggests.
with Albany taking all six of their
singles matches by wide margins.
Only Dave Denny needed a third set'
to do away with his Coast Guard op-
ponent. Denny started off slowly
before taking command and
triumphing. Mr. (H. 6-2. Dennyttnd
doubles partner l’aul Fcldmtin were
equally dcvastati ng while coasting to
a (H. 6‘2 straight-set doubles vic-
tory. Cotrst Gunrd‘s number two
doubles tandem were only slightly
more effective. extending Mitch
Sandler and Phil Ackcrman to three
sets before succumbing. 2-6. 6-3, 6-4.
The only bright spot for Coast
Guard was a 6-2, 7-5 doubles victory
over Albany‘s Matt Reich and Mike
Fertig.

For Coach Bob Lewis the win
represented his 50th victory in his
four years as the team's pilot. as op-
posed to only eleven dual match
losses.

Despite the undefeated record,
Coach Lewis did not think the fall
season was a total success. "Not win-
ulna the SUNY Conference title was

a big disappointment.“ commented
Lewis. “but we still hope to repeat as
SUNY University Center Champs
next spring.” Albany will attempt to
defend that title against Buffalo,
Binghamton and Stony Brook in
April.

The Coach also expressed a desire
to compete in the NCAA division lll
tournament next May. The Danes
could not participate in the NCAA‘s
last year because the competition
coincided with final exams.

Standing in the way of this
season's NCAA berth. however. is a
spring schedule even more awesome
than any Biology final. Among the
Danc's spring opponents are
Colgate. Army. and the University
of Massachusetts (all NCAA divi—
sion 1 members). The Danes were
beaten hundin last year by Colgate.
who ranked fourth in east coast tert—
nis at the time.

Not to say the team is afraid of
that kind of competition. Sandler
claims that while the Danes are as
good a team as last year, other
schools have diluted their line-ups
considerably. The Albany junior
noted, “Some ofthose schools lost a
lot of players who were seniors last
year. Now those teams are carrying
more freshmen."

Sandler also feels the team has a
good chance in the NCAAs. When
Mitch competed as a freshman. the
competition consisted of both divi.
sion ll and division Ill schools. The

Chanting “stop racism”. a group
of 25 students from various minority
groups on campus staged a
demonstration in the Rathskeller
yesterday afternoon.

The students were protesting what
they considered to be discrimination
on the part of the Ruthskeller‘s
management in the removal of their
organizations‘ advertisements.

At about noon. a spokesperson
for the group claimed the
Rathskeller ripped down their signs
and demanded that people boycott
the Rat. The spokesperson. who
refused to be identified. said
“Anyone who is patronizing the
Rnths kcllcr is pcrpct tinting racism.”

Assistant Manager of the

Rttlhskcllcr l’aul Arnold admitted to
tearing down the gruups'signs about
half" an hour after they were put up.
“We like to have a nice ncnt. clcnn.

"livery rrighl all signs not on the
bulletin boards are removed by the

Because of the large number of
signs that the protesting groups had
put up. Arnold felt that he had to
take them down before the evening.
Accordingto Lester Hynes. manager
of the Rathskeller. the walls and the
doors had become completely
covered with posters before they
were removed. .

According to Hynes there are
three places where signs may be
posted; by the door and by the two

Students Pressured Into Majors

by (iavin Murphy

Because financial cutbacks have
reduced the number of advisors
trvuilttblc. students are now being
pressured to declare a major after
completing only 24 credits instead of
4b.

“We‘re now asking them to do in
two semesters what they used to do
in four." said University College
Assistant Dean Leonard Lupinski.

lhc new Uni\crsily policy is
geared to gel students out of UCund
into specific departments for advise-
ment its soon as tlrcstudcut is willing
to decide on n major. However.
Luplllski stressed that although
students are now bcingencournged
to make llrat decision earlier. it” such
decisions are "tentative and can
always be changed.“

UC lost four full time advisors
after last spring's task force cut-
bucks. Lapinski said. "The Ad-
ministration fecls this is an area that
can be cut." “We have fought this
right along." he continued.

The University College Census of

Lower Division Majors. released
September 29. states that students in
the University College are in-
crcasrngly undecided about what
major to pursue. are being provided
with less advisement to aid them in
making it decision. and are being
pressured to decide cttrlicr.
Advisement Need (ircater

Lupinski lccls that fire Census irr-
dicalcs a greater unwillingness on
the part of students who are up-
prclicnsivc about their future to
make it busty decision. Consequently
he says that there is an even greater
need for advisement of the sort
provided by HG

lf further cutbacks are made Un-
ivcrsity College faces the possibility
of tottrl annihilation and Lupinski
says he doesn't know what would
happen if this should occur.

Lapinski. who has been with Un-
iversity College since it originated in
I964. stated that at present there is
"no spokesman for undergraduate
education." According to Lttpinski

The students claimed “we brought

Hynes said. "They thought that
they were being picked on arbitrari-
ly. which they weren't."
In a statement drawn up by the
students. and signed by the panel
members. the Rathskeller agreed to
provide two new bulletin boards. to
he put up no later than next Thurs—
day. for the express purpose of
posting all notices and signs.

SUNY Responds To Regents Cuts

by Mark (ireenstein

The Board of Regents mct yester-
daylo discuss revisions ofthcir l976
Master “Plan for l’ostsccondury
Education with various SUNY ad—
ministrators and faculty. The
mcclinj.I took place in the New York
State Education Building.

The first draft of the Regents“
Plan. issued August In. proposed in-
creased tuition bikes for public
schools. program culbucks. doing
away with tenure. and a revision of
the concept of education. The
proposals were received by SUNY
administrators and faculty with dis-
satisfaction.

Yesterday‘s meeting was the last
chance for educational speakers to
express their views on the proposals.
Governor H ugh Carey will comment
on the Regents' proposals by

of Undergraduate Studies at the end
of lost your there are u lot of un-
answered questions."

anrnski sind he regrets that
freshmen are being given less time
for cxplorulion and when usde if he
fell students could make a good deci—
sion after taking only 24 credits he
replied "No." He added that so for
this year. UC ndvisors have been
able to provide services for the same
ratio of students as last year. despite
the personnel losses. bccuusc sortie
sludcnls have left the UC and are
now being udviscd by department
faculty members.

However. some of these students
have indicated dissatisfaction with
their mujors itlld want to return to
the UC. These students must it“ see
Lupinski to do so and he say “this
adds to the workload."

Each UC advisor bundles 350-380
students and according to Lupinski
they "are not really able to spend
enough time with the st udents."

Another v problem is thut in-

SUNY Vice Chancellor James F.
Kelly. speaking for Chancellor
lirncst Boyer who is away in
England. said “We are very concern—
cd about the danger of plttnmng or
reviewing budgets without
professional knowledge about the
availability of resources." Kelly add-
ed. "The plan proposes rr new con—
ccplion that, in our view. is not con—
sistent with thctruditions ol the state
and the university.“

The Regents suggested that public
institutions be funded at levels suf-
ficient to meet defined enrollment
goals and institutional missions cs<
lnblislrcd through llrc approved
master plans.

The Regents noted that enroll-
ment and resource figures in the
public institutions have doubled in
the past decade. They said that the
same figures for independent
colleges and universities rose slightly
less than fifty per cent during the
same period.

President of SUNY at Stony
Brook John Toll said. “I think it is
unreasonable to fix tuition rates at a
fixed percentage at the cost of in~
struclion . . . lthinkthe wholenp-
proaclr is illogical."

'I‘Al’ To Increase

They said that public students
should contribute one-third of the
cost of their undergraduate tuition
cost and forty per cent ofthe cost of
their graduate study. To compensate
for these incrcttscs the maximum un-
dergraduate TA l’ award will be in-
creased lrom SLSOO to $1.700 per
year. not to exceed tuition costs

The overall Icch of state funding
for independent institutions should
equal twenty five per cent ofthc slun-
durd cost of undergraduate educa-
tion. the Regents said.

Charles Trendwell. n member of"
the Regents Planning Bureau staff.
said that the Regents are trying to
maintain a balance of both public
and private educational sectors.

'l‘rcadwcll said that it costs the
state an eighth of the amount to
educate the student at a private
college than at a public institution.

“It makes sense to maintain a
healthy independent sector.“
'l'rcadwcll said that il'thc cost goes
up in public institutions the cost is
also going to go up in private in-
stitutions. "The state is going to

share the costs with SUNY
students.“
l'rcndwcll continued. “The

Regent‘s Statewide Plan will come at
a criticer time providi ngfor the coor-
di nating development of post secon-
dary education among public and
non-public institutions.“

'l‘readwcll said that in the last five
years 29 per cent of community
college graduates transferred to
four-year schools. SUNY assumes
the figure is as high as 35 per cent for
continuing twa year students at the
present time.

The Board of Regents are the con-
stitutional designated body for es-
tablishing educational policy in New
York State. The Statewide l’lan is»a
quadrennial document required by
state law. From this document the
Regents outline the goals. objectives.
and resources required for post
secondary education which are
usually effective for a ten or If) year
planning period.

The Regents wish to advise the
State Public Authority Control
Board and the State Division of
Bridget on educational priorities. “It
seems logical". said Treadwell, “that
if you are building cdueational
buildings. sortie decision to build
should include educational input
regarding ituplicitntion in terms of
