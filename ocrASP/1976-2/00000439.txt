“His office has already been told
that it should anticipate {tether staff

reduction will leave university

advisement.

At present, advisement at the na-

iversity is in a state of transitioa'

between total faculty advisemei
andthe advisement of Iowerdivisia
students (freshmen and
sophomores) by nonteaching
professionals and graduate
assistants.

As of the 1967-77 academic year.
university college handles students
with fewer than 24 crdeits, studema
who have not declared a major and
students awaiting admission to I
progam which requires them to
have met prior qualifications, such
as the accounting and business ad-
ministration programs in the school
of business.

In addition to advising individual
studems, according to Gray, univer-
sity college facilitates faculty advise-
ment in a number of ways.

The university college staff solicits
from schools and departments
within the university information
concerning course offerings, major
requirements, suggested second
ﬁelds, career opportunities, etc.
puts this information into one
academic information manual, and
distributes these manuals to the
departments for their use in advising

adds a “small core of people in a un-

‘Aca *  Advisement Faces Uncertain

“If we got all majors (in the
department), we would do a worse
job of advising than we do now,"
says Richard Hauser, biology
professor who coordinates advrse-
ment for his department. Hauser
says his department has ap-
proximately 1,000 students now,
with the advisor/advisce ratio about
30to I.

In the undergraduate school of
business, over 1,000 students are
low adw'sed by one person. Utilizing
a selfvadtisement system entitled
Operation EP (Educational Plan-
ing), which basically consists of
worksheets listing major re-
quriements and course sequences,
junior and senior business students
plan their own schedule.

Helen T. Pelersi, assistant to the
dean of the school of business, has
the task of accepting schedules or rc-
qucsting a conference before
preregistration to work out
problems which exist.

In this way. Pclcrsi is able to “ad-
vise " over 1,000junior and senior
business students every semester.
Pelersi says of the prospect of ad-
vising freshmen and sophomores as
well. "I‘ve thought about it but I'd
prefer to have no comment on it.“

The undergraduate school of
business is also an example of a

OCTOBER 22. 1976

LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP)
While many nations largely have
given up on civil defense projects,
traditionally neutral Switzerland has
developed bomb shelters in Alpine
tunnels and taken other measures in
a $2.4—billion program to protect its
6 million people in the event of
nuclear war.
Air Raid Shelter
The latest addition is the
Sonncnberg superhighway tunnel
through the Alps near here. In case
of war, four giunt stch and concrete
doors will close. converting the
tunnel into the nation's largest air
raid shelter.

Defense experts say the program
gives the Swiss a greater chance of
nuclear survival than any other
country.

Right now, 3.2 million people can
move to underground blast-and-
radiution‘proof safety. By 1990 not a
single resident of the country will
have to look in vain for shelter,
government ofﬁcials claim.

Under one of the world‘s most
comprehensive civil defense
programs initiated I4 years ago,
every Swiss household is required to
build and stock its own private
shelter. .

College Ed Costs Increasing

The tulttl cost of attending college
has increased almost nine pcrccttt
since last year according to informa-
tion collected by the College
Scholarship Service, the finttnciul
illd brunch of the College Entrance
Examination Ilourd.

The information was the net result
of a nationwide survey on the costs
of a college education at more than
2,500 institutions across the country.

One finding of the survey was that

college costs vary according to the
location of institutions around the
country. Regional cost comparisons
show that the most expensive in-
stitutions arc in the Middle States
region and New England. In these
regions uvcrttge totttl costs for resi-
dent students hover around $100011!
public colleges and around $5,000 at
privtttc colleges.
