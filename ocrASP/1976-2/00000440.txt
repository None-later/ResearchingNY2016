with a supply of wine and cheese to

Sometimes they just drink the night

their bikes at closing time and take

This entails several stops at all-

The Friars have a code of looking
out for each other.

 
   
 

“Once we had a guy fall off his
bike, but usually everybody manages
to hand on.” says Jerry Cross. 34,
club president. “We do have a lot of
people who develop amnesia on
these trips. Theyforget anythingem-
barrassing they might have done
along the way."

The average age of the Friars is
about 30. and most Work at white
collar jobs. There are nearly as many
women as men in the club. and
almost all are either single of divorc-
ed.

“I used to be embarrassed just
hanging out in bars all the time, but
here we drink and do things. We get
in a lot of exercise." said Dave

Crux of Advisement

Helping students. Most people
seem to agree that this is the crux of
advising. whether academic. career
or life. Disagreement arises over
such issues as what the advisor/ad-
visee relationshipshould be. whether
advisement should be provided with
incentives for their role as adivsors.
and how to coordinate and improve

       

  

the system.
One Question Remains

Decisions will be forth coming
that will at least modify the
procedural tispects of advisement. if
not the qualitative. While solving
some problems. such changes may
create new ones. especially for larger
and more complex departments and
schools within the university. And
one ultimate question remains. Will
complaints about and problems with
academic advisement ever be
resolved? That remains to be seen.

Gross said. “For most of the
members, the club probably
provides at least 50 per cent of their
social lives. On some weekends we
go camping. And inthe winter we set
up skiing trips."
Meat Market

Gross said a lot of the Friars went
through the “meat market scene"—
the discos and dance clubs where
most singles meet members of the
opposite sex.

“That wears you out after a while.
It‘s so electric. Everybody feels

   

obligated to hustle. You have to

two types of singles. The pretty peo.
