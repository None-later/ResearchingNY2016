By SUSAN MILLER

“i am the entertainer . . . lmay
have won your hearts." sings Billy
Joel in a melody from his Streetlife
Serenade album.

Friday evening Billy Joel clearly
won the hearts of his audience after a
vibrant two hour performance that
ended with four cncorcs.

The 27 ycttr old Joel is un entcr-
tuincr in cvcry scnsc oi‘thc word. His
humor. charisma. and talent
enthralled the 2900 people gathered
at Albany‘s Palace Theatre.

Cruel

 

The concert began at 8:40 p.m.
with the three-woman band Deadly
Nightshade. Excitement was evident
as the audience was anxious for Joel
to appear.

The group did not cause audience
resentment as warm-up bands often
do. They were aware that people
come to see Billy Joel and several
times they mentioned he would
appear shortly.

The lively country-rock beat drew
audience response with rhythmic
hand clapping. “Dance. Mr. Bigg

“I don’t want to imitate myself.
You die out in two or three years
if you do that. I may not be a

superstar, lsut l’m still around.”

It was unusual to see an all female

shown ‘themselves to be ac-

One hour after the concert began,
the stage was darkened. Taped music
provided a background as five

across the stage. The fervor and ex-
citement brought the audience to its
