Iy BRYAN HOLZIERG

Saturday night and some 3000
people filled the SUNYA gym to see
and hear one of the good guys from
Watergate. “Investigative
reporter"was his billing. Bob
Woodward is author of All Ihe
President‘s Men and The Final
Days.

Bob Woodward says “Watergate
was an easy crime story. It was in-
cremental and logical and so often
politics is none of those things.”

But only l4 of over 2000
newspapermen assigned to covering
Washington D.C. did any work on
Watergate, according to Woodward.
And so he decided to lecture on the
performance of thejournalist today;
insights derived from his nearly
singlehandcd coverage of the story
as it broke.

He began his talk with 30 minutes
of quick recapping of the
Watergate story. " l t‘s
strange and unique that we learned
as much as we did.“ Woodward says.
Speaking of the personal. un-
documented look at the Nixon
White House in The Final Dayr: “it
showed the human side. It was a
moral play of sorts; there was, is. a
lot that was never reported.“

After the talk. Woodward said
that the book contains errors that
have to be changed. “We
[Woodward and Carl Bernstein]
placed some people in a room who
weren't there. We said they remained
silent on a question that was never
raised. I'm struck now by how im-
perfect our work is; there's the no-
tion that we‘ve got to scrape the sur-
face away from stories. We don‘t sit

and think and say, who else might
have a view on the story. . .Reportcrs
have too great a sense of self and
truth."

Questions asked of Woodward
following his talk sought his view of
truth. his speculations on politics.
new John Dean revelations, and the
Nixon tape system (“Without which
Nixon would be preparing his
Halloween message as President.")

One student whose question was
glossed over said, “He’s closer to the
truth. he knows more than we do.”

“The public doesn't find out
everything the reporter knows,"says
Woodward.

Like who is Deep Throat? Or does
he even exist?

“I can tell you he is one person
who provided much infor-
mation."Woodward says. But that is
as far as he will go. Claiming he
promised the individual immunity.
“Carl (Bernstein) doesn‘t even know
who he is." he smiles.

And after an hour-long talk.
Woodward mumbled “thank-you"
to loud applause, as autograph
seekers crowded close to the
podium. Ticket stubs. hardcover
books. and scraps of paper were
thrust in his face. He struggled to
sign them all.

“What's your background injour-
nalism'i". he was asked. “I'm a
Yaley“.

“What part did Bradlce‘s
(Woodward‘s editor) bias against
Nixon or his journalistic integrity
play in the l’ost's competitive drive
to get the Watergate story?" “Don't
you want my autograph)".
Woodward said.

Bob Woodward played the role of
talking reporter Saturday night. He
is not the most profound lecturer in
the world.

The Classical Fer-

 

The ASPof October l5 contained
an article entitled “Copies Replace
Ancient Greeks." Unfortunately this
article contained numerous errors
WhiCh ought not to go uncorrected.

There is no such thing as the
Karyates Temple. There. is the
Erechlheum. One part of that
building is called the Porch of the
Maidens. because its roof is sup-
ported by caryatidr. i.e. columns
carved in the form ofdraped figures.
There are not seven of these, but six.
and one of them is already a replace-
ment. as the orginal was removed by
Lord Elgin and is now on display in
the British Museum in London.

The mythical King of Athens to
whom the article refers was named
not Kekropus but Kekrops or
Curry/u. He supposedly was king
when Athena and Poseidon engaged
in a contest for the possession ofthe
city. In an he is depicted not as a

 

reclining woman but as a serpent-
man, human above the waist and ser-
pent below.

Callirrhoe (“fair flowing") was a
spring in Athens. There are also
several minor mythological
characters by that name, but none is
associated with Cecrops. The iden—
tification of Cecrops and Callirrhoe
in the pedimental sculpture of the
Parthenon is quite problematic, to

say the but.

The Acropolis ,wu walled long
before the sixth century. and in the
sixth century there were no more
Pelasgians. It is true that the
Acropolis was laid waste by the Per-
sians in 480 B.C.. but the buildin’
surviving on the Acropolis today
were erected well after 480 EC.

The Associated Press just failed
CIA 208.
