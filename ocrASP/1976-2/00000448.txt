‘e ' a shame ?

Consider... ’ , ' .
Consider the job market. In spite of what you hear, there are

jobs out there.
But to‘get those jobs you need more than a degree or grades.

You need practical experience.

You...

You can get that experience at college. Student groups,
university committees, part-time jobs and volunteer work are

all available.
They are the real experiences you’ll need for success in the

real world.

You’re only in college
a short time.

 

Wouldn’t it be a shame
if all you got was a degree?

 Polo Finishes 4-1 Dane  

ln s come-from-behind victory,
the Albany State Water Polo team
defeated Cobleskill 9-8. Tuesday. to
close out its “very successful" ﬁrst

season. '

“For the ﬁrst time‘ out." explained
player-coach Watson Crich, “this
club showed we have much depth
and potential." Who can argue with
a 4-1 initial campaign?

The Cobleskill contest was cited
by Crich as “the most dramatic. We
were trailing by two goals going into
the last quarter. sol decided on some
position changes." Those changes
resulted in three goals and a one-goal
triumph.

The team was formed by Jack
Simmons and Jeff Cohen about a
month ago. but was only able to get
in two weeks of practice before the

season began. It was enough, as
Albany was able to heat every oppo-
nent it faced. “Our only loss came to
RPI. but we met them later on inthe
season and came out on top.”

Crich explained that the reasons
for his squad's surprisingsuccess are
elementary. “We always had the
strongest swimmers which is half the
game. We were fortunate to have lost
only one swim-off, thanks to Dan
Dudley and some ﬁne ball-handling
by Peter Eckenberg."

Next Se-on In March

“We hope to have Kim Engle and
Jay Whiteford back with us next
year.“ adds Crich. “They both had
good seasons as goalies." The next
season will be in March. and Crich
explains that any interested students
should contact him.

In the Jockette-Afternoon Delight
game. both sides displayed con-
siderable offensive power. Ann
Yuhas scored three TDs, and speedy
Wendy Martinez added another for

Afternoon Delight. The Jockettes. '

led by the running of Nancy Pat'-
frath and Sherri Zimet, trailed until
the closing moments of the game.
Then Beth Jenning intercepted a
Bins Donahue pass and ran it in for
the score. putting the Jockettes over
the top.

In Sunday's ﬁrst contest. Strange,
behind the strong passing and run-
ning of Cathy “Dunker” Dower and
Twink Sugihara. outplayed After-
noon Delight 30-7.

Dower threw two touchdown
passes to Maria Abruzzino, while
Sugihara ran in two-one on a nicely
executed reverse and the other on an
interception of a Bins Donahue
pass. The other Strange TD came on
a reverse play. with Sugihara passing
to Dower for the score. Afternoon
Delight‘s lone score came on a long
run by Anne Yuhas.

In the second contest. the
Joekettcs shut out injury-hampered
Kappa Delta. Sherri Zimet scored
one touchdown and 2 PAT's; one on
a pass from Jockctte quarterback
Kathy Granitski.

shortstop Mask Iiceio’ (.363).
baseman Jim‘  (3752;
Htﬂelder Hamisr’tm.’ rigid?
ﬁelder John Craig (.206), and
designated hitter Mike Melur
(.266). Albany's run production 
much to be desired, as the team
eclipsed their average of ﬁve per
game in only for of the l4 pines.

“Both freshmen did well." noted ‘
Burlingame concerning his rookie
ballplayers. Steve Muldoon. a
pitcher. allowed only two runs as he
went the distance in the Iigllup
apinst Cortland last week. losing 2-
0. ‘Cardillo was the biggestsurprise,
however.” he said.

There's a lot to look forward to in
the spring of 1977. For instance. the
Danes have six twinhills scheduled.
ﬁve at home. Among others. the gold
and purple will see division clam-
pions Cortland and Brockport, as
well as national power New Haven.

Coach Burlingame expects help
from the football team. “I'll he get-
ting [Mike] Mirabella [a catcher]
back . . . and maybeone pitcher." He .
was referring to Glenn Sowalskie. a
right-handed pitcher. who missed
last year when he suffered a football
injury. then dropped out of school.

There are questions also. Can
Silverman. batting a siering .390 in
the SUNYAC. repeat as All-
Conference? Will the freshmen con-
tinue to improve? And now that
Albany has no chance for the con-
ference crown. will they concentrate
on the Capital District Cham-
pionship and oust Siena? Coach
Hurlingamc says yes on all three
counts. “I‘m looking forward to it."
he says. So are we.
