.It was supposedly a contest. But
the ' only “foes” the Albany State
soccer team faced Wednesday was
the rain and the sloppy conditions
that prevailed on the soccer field as
the Booters splashed to their fourth
consecutive victory—a 4—0 shut out
of Plattsburgh.

“The game wasn‘t too close." ex-
plained Schieffelin. “and they

kind of diny. I didn't want to take
any chances on us getting hurt." But
for Jorge Aquilar. it was too late.

Mixed Year For Danetters

by Christine Bellini

“We finished the season pretty
well”. began coach Peggy Mann.
"compared to the way we began."
With a record of four wins. six
losses. and one tie. the women's var-
sity tennis team recorded their first
losing season since Mrs. Mann
originated the team in I963.

"A lot of women love to play ten-
nis." she said. "but hate to compete.
unfortunately for us."

But that‘s not the whole story. Un-
derneath the shroud of ti losing
season. the Danettcs had their
moments of glory and stars of the
court. '

Jane Maloy, Albany State‘s
number one women's player. faced
an old rival from Union College on
Monday. Leslie Kent. Union‘s
number one seed. beat Muloy last
year in two quick sets (t-l. 6-2. This
year. with the contest extended to
three sets. Muloy turned the tables
and defeated Kent. 4-6. 7-5. 6-2 to
even their running contest.

Because of ruin the matches
against Union were held in the Tri-
city Ruequei Club. Albany was
ahead in three matches to one——
thanks to Muloy. 3rd singles Dee
Dee Strandbury. (6-4. 3-6. 7-5) and
the doubles team of Barbara
Zimmerman and Fran Greenbergt7--
5.6-i)-—bcforc the matches had to be

called due to scheduled members rc-

questing their reserved courts.

Colleen Joycc. second singles. suf-
fered Albany's onlyloss in twoiough
sets 2-6. 4-6. Third and fourth singles
Carol Farrere and Lorna Stio had to
forgo their matches to the 'I‘ri-city
members. Perhaps feeling the
biggest letdown. the doubles team of
Terry Lcnehan and Paula Sausville
relinquished their court. calling the
results a tie after one set each. at 6-2.
3-4.

A week earlier. the Danettes
hosted the (ircen Mountain netters
at the Southwuod Tennis Club also
because of rainy weather. Recording
their first tic of the season the
Danettcs won three and lost three
before the match was called.
(Number one seed. lIiCI. Mariseuodo

Albany goalie Alberto Giordano
made his ﬁrst appearance since the
opener. when he started the second
half in net. Dario Arango had
carried the goal-tending duties by
himself for the succeeding nine
games before Giordano‘s return.
Wednesday.

“I have to comment on the ex-
cellent play of the gotilics." explain-
ed Schicffclin. “Going into the last
part of the season. we have not one,
but two excellent goalies on the
learn. That‘s going to make its tough
to beat."

Giordano. following Arungo‘s
lead. allowed no shots by him in his
45-minute stint. But. truthfully.
therejusi was not an overabundance
of I’Iattsburgh scoring attempts. In
fact. the final statistics showed the
visitors taking it blistering/bursltots

total of 42 that Albtiny rccorded.
Not that Albany completely
dominated play. It just scented that
the referees had tnorc scoring

Regents Tenure Plan

by Tom Marlello .
The New York State Board of
Regents' recommendation that
faculty be given renewable five-year
contracts has met with skepticism
from various SUNYA officials.
The proposed five-year plan is
aimed at reducing the number of
tenured teachers throughout the
SlillL‘. ticcordingio Regents l’lumiing
Bureau member Charles Treadwcll.
“Over the years. enrollments at
universities grew. faculty were hired
and they gained tenure.“ said
Trcadwell. “In some instances most
of the faculty of a university gained
tenure. When that happens. it limits
the vitality of younger teachers with
new approaches."
The plan features an IS-month
notification period for faculty who

will not bc renewed in the five-year '

plan. and is viewed by Treadwell as
“a system that will provide more
flexibility."

The Board of Regents guidelines
suggest that no campus in the state
cxcccd having 60 per cent of the
faculty tenured.

“This recommendation does not

stop tenure. but limits it.“ said
Treadwell. “It is a prolongation of
probation. What would happen
would be that over the period of
renewing contracts. older professors
will retire and leave openings for
tenure.“

SUNYA Assistant Vice President
for Academic Affairs David Martin
believes that the Regents'
recommendation has some major
flaws.

"They're talking about their
jurisdictions. They'd have to deal
with employers and employees in ad-
dition to the different bargaining un-
its. What they would bedoingwould
be changing a condition of employ-
ment and to promote this change
would be in violation of the Taylor
Law."

Trcudwcll says that the new
system would provide more oppor-
tunities for younger teachers.

“If an institution has a high
proportion of tenured teachers. they
will let the newer members of the
faculty go first. By suggesting in-
stead a short-term renewable
employment for faculty. it affords

“People want security." Martin
countered. “Suppose someone starts

his contract gets renewed four times.
he is let go. Although that potential-
ly opens tipa place fora younger per-
son. it will also put a 50—year-old out
into the job market."

No Protection

Trcadwell admitted that “There is
no long-term protection. but a
longer range for younger teachers.
Now. a teacher has three years for
tenure. If there's a high proportion
of tenured teachers at the respective
university. they might have to fire
him. If they can‘t offer him tenure.
they have to let him go.“

Accordingto Martin. the five-year
tenure plan could affect the standard
of education in New York State.

“Theoretically. this provides more
llcxibility. but runs the risk of put-

Hearings Held on Class

by Mark I’Ievin

The Committee on Student Con-
duct is conducting hearings concer-
ning a Class of 1978 debt ofuboiit
$4300.

The Committee is a sub-
committee of the Student Affairs
Council of the University Senate.
According to Slutlt'nl Guidelines
[9764977, the Committee serves its
the prime hearing body in cases that
are considered to be “serious in
nature."

Dean for Student Affairs Neil
Brown issued the following state-
mem yesterday afternoon on behalf
of the committee:

“During the I976 summer recess.

SUN YA Campus Cops Request Firearms

by Paul Rosenthal

A letter from two University
Police officers to President Emmett
ll. Fields has culled fortlicurming of
campus police “before such time as
one of our members suffers serious
physical injury or loss of life." The
letter was prompted by two recent
incidents on campus which involved
guns.

The two officers who wrote the
letters tire representatives ofthe Un-
iversity Police Union. the American
Federation of State. County. and
Municipal Employees. A number of
other officers said last week they
were not in total agreement with the
call for arming campus police.
