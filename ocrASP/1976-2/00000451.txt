WASHINGTON (AP) Food
manufacturers are telling consumers
more abont what‘s inside the cans.
. jars and boxes they sell. but the in-
formation is not always easy to
decipher.

Government studies show that
shoppers often do not understand
labeling information on fat. car-
bohydrate. cholesterol or sodium

‘ content. They are confused about

the meaning of figures pertaining to
the government‘s recommended dai-
ly allowance of vitamins and
minerals.

The Food and Drug Administra-'

tion now requires nutritional labels
on any food that has been fortiﬁed or
enriched or for which a nutritional
claim is made. Even astatement such
as “rich in Vitamin C" is enough to

Metric System Faces Clear Skies

The Mt. Washington Weather In-
strument Co., which does business
thrt Jghout the world from its head-
quarters in Berlin. New Hampshire
has taken a major step to help the
United States convert more easily to
the metric system.

The Company has ptit together a
complete weather station with the
metric system on the dial face. in-
eluding the measurements the U.S.
has always used tll'ltl soon will be
abandoning

The wind speed indicator is both
in MPH and in kilometers; the wind
direction meter is In points of the
compass; tlic hill‘tllIIClL'l' is in inclle
and milibttrs. and the temperature
both in fithi'ciihcit and cclsitis.

Joseph C. Runci. lllt.‘ president of
Mt. Washington Wciithcr Instru-
incnt (o. siiitl tlic lirm decided to
panic t he way into t he wcathcr instru-
ment metric system t'ortwo principal
I‘L'ilbtlllh‘:

Since the metric system will be the
dominant system to be used by the
United States. it is nowtimcly for the
general public to become ac-
customed to it' use in measuring
such an important part of our daily
lives as the weather.

Also. the United States has made
funds available to local educational
agencies to tenchchildrcnto adapt to
the metric system. Use ofthc weather
station intlie classroom is one means
for which tltc licdcral government
will entertain applications for funds
from local agencies.

the funds are made available on-
dcr an amendment to thc Elcmcn-
my and Secondary Education Act.
sttyittg: "It is the policy ofthc United
States to encourage educational
agencies and institutions to prepare
students to usc thc inctric systems of
measurement with case and facility
its part ol the rcguliir cdtiiitional
program."

Runci said that “Schools. of

would benefit from the type ofcom-

Food LabelingFoundCo"

require nutritional labeling.

The manufacturer must list the
size of a serving in- ounces. cups,
slices or whatever and the number of
servings per container. He also must
list the number of calories and the
weight in grams. of protein. car-
bohydrate and fat in eachserving. In
addition. the label must include the
percentage of the us. Recommend-
ed Daily Allowance for protein. five
vitamins and two minerals contained
in each serving

The US. RDA's indicate how
much of a given nutrient is necessary
to maintain good health. If a
nutritional label lists .Vitamin A.
followed by the number ten. that
means one serving of the product
provides ten per cent of the amount
of Vitamin A needed every day.

Part of consumers‘ confusion may
be due to the fact that protein is
listed twice on nutritional labels—
once by the number of grains and
once by the percentage of the US.
RDA provided in a serving.

Another reasonforconfusion may
bcthe frequent use of ounces for scr-
ving size and grams for nutritional
information.

A spokesman for the FDA said
the use of grams for the ntttrition in-
formation is required. first. because
the nation is switching to the metric
system and second. because the
amounts involved often are too

small-to be expressed in'ounces; . , _'

Reading a nutritional label won't

tell you at a glance what part d t“

given product is fat. for example.
Y0u will have to do your otVn
calculations for that. There are just
over 28 grams in an ounce. Thelabel
will. however. enable you to com-
pare the amount of fat in different
foods with different serving sizes.

Some of the information appear-
ing on nutritional labels is optional.
including the cholesterol and sodium
content. .

Sugar Content Demanded

The Kellogg Co. recently started
providing some information that is
not required bythe government. but

has often been demanded by con- .

sumer groups—t he sugar content of
various cereals.

“We are trying to give the con-
sumers what they want and need.”
said company president W.E.
Lamothe.

Kellogg considered listing the
sugar content by percentage, rather
than by grams per ounce. but the
company siud it decided such infor-
mation would be misleading. To
support its claim. Kellogg points out
that the number of grams ofsugar in
a whole orange and in one ounce of
Kellogg‘s Sugar Smacks are the
same, although the percentage of
sugar in the orange is smaller since
the frtiit weighs more.
