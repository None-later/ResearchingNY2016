WASHINGTON (AP) The 'way
President Ford has ' run foreign
policy and Jimmy Carterfs charge
that Ford isn't really at the throttle
could prove decisive in these final
days of the election campaign.
Flailing each other over both style
and substance. the two candidates
have delineated enough of a
difference between them to help set-
tlc what appears to be a very close

rttcc.

Agreement 0n Foreign Policy

But in a broad sense, Ford and
Carter also have demonstrated that
there is a considerable agreement
between them on the outline of U.S.
foreign policy—containing" com-
munism. stemming the spread of
nuclear weapons and keeping the
peace.

Ford has signaled thut hc plans no
major rcvcrsttl or change of course if
ltc is returned to the White House for
four more yej '3. And he has said he
would like to retain Henry Kissinger
us sccrctttry of state.

Curtcr bus plcdgcd to bring more
"morality" to foreign policy. to con-
sult more with Congress and the
public. Hc has criticized Kissinger as
it “Lonc Ranger" caught up in a
“one-man policy of international
udvcnturc.“

II' onc thing is clear about u Cnrtcr
administration. it is that there Would
be no plttcc in it for Henry Kissinger.

But can l'orcign policy be con-

ducted without the secrecy Cztrtcr

laments? Would he cut tics with most

or till of thc repressive regimes in the
world? By comparison. the
democracies are few in number.

Whtttcver the answer. Cnrtcr
tippcurs committed to injecting morc
morality into foreign policy. to more
openness and to toughcr tactics in
dealing with the Russians. “The
Soviet Union.“ he complains. “has
known what they want in dctcntc
llnd they‘ve gotten it.“

Ford. for his part. seems comfor-
table with and bent on maintaining

‘ the status quo in foreign policy. His

administration has not been
noticeably innovative. The one,
signiﬁcant exception was to assume
principal diplomatic responsibility
for transferring control of Rhodesia
from its 270.000 whites to its six
million blacks. The outcome of that
move is still not cIcar. .

The overriding foreign policy
message of the Ford campaign is:
“What is more moral then pcace.and
the United States is at peace in the
world." With that in mind, there has
also bccna virtual plcdgctocontinue
efforts in the Middle East. in
southern Africa and elsewhere to
resolve conflicts pcuccfully.

From the start. seizing the in-
hcrcnt advantage of a presidential
incumbent in ii race with u onc-tcrm
governor. Ford has stressed his ex-
pcricnc'c: A quarter-century in the
House. a dccttdc us the GOP Ictidcr
there. and his two ycurs in the Oval
ofﬁce.

As President. hc bus ncgotitttcd
with the Russians. pursucd ll
relationship with China. been the
first prcsidcnl to visit Japan. Above
all. he says. pcttcc hlIS bccn the prin-
cipul gottl and itchicvcmcnt of his tid-
ministration.

At Peace With Freedom

"America is strong." Ford sttys.
“America is free. Amcrictt is
respected. Not ll singlc young
American is fighting or dying on any
foreign battlefield. Amcricu is at
pcucc with frccdom."

Iiy making the pcucc ttrgumcnt.
Ford has Icft it to the voter to infer
that it might be risky to put it
Dcmocritl in tltc Whitc House:

Carter has rcspondcd to thc
clntllcngc of Ford‘s experience and
inctunbcncy by portraying the I’rcsi-
dcnt llb’ ll bumblcr and “it very weak
lender“ who isn't rcttlly in charge
anyhow. “As for IIS foreign policy is
conccrncd." Curtcr contcnds.

“Kissinger ha! been president of this
country.” 

On the theoretical level. Ford and
Carter have indicated contrasting
outlooks. Ly

The President. possiny reflecting
the views of his principal advisor.
Kissinger. seems more inclined to
have the Russians in mind in plotting
policy. Both the Middle Em and

Carter

southern Al'rictt initiatives were
promptcd lII lcttst in part to reduce
Soviet inllucncc.

Cttrtcr. pcrhups in line with the
"global politics“ ttdvoctitcd by his
key ttdvisor. Prof. Zbignicw
Ilrrcrinski. has called for 11 rcordcr-
ing of priorities to give first plncc to
relations with dcmocrtttic ttllics
rather than communist powcrs.

Thch are other differences that
have developed bctwccn tltc cun-
didtttcs.

Nuclear weapons negotiations:
Ford takes credit for his I974ttgrcc-
mcnt with Soviet lcudcr Lconid
Brezhch to limit the two super-
powers to 2.400 weapons systems.
Curtcr contends negotiations are
dczidlockcd because the limits are
too high. He says the objective
should be mutual rcductions.

ministration has often made Israel

"the scapegoat” and has vowed he

Would meet any threat of an oil'
boycott with a comprehensive

.withdrawal of all aid.

Pun-ml: Ford has said the United
States wants only to maintain
"access" to the canal and to insure its
security. Carter. taking a harder line
on current negotiations. has said he
would never relinquish control of the

Ford Supports Arm Soles

Arms sales: Ford has supported
the booming U.S. arm sales abroad.
