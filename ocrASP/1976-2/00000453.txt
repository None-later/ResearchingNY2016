Moynihan, Buckley Hope
As Election Draws Near

NEW YORK (AP) Daniel Patrick
Moynihan says Sen. James Buckley
is a “millionaire extremist“ whom he
will beat by six percentage points on
Nov. 2. '

Moynihan, a former U.S. am-
bassador to the United Nations and
to India. .conceded that Buckley is
running ahead of him in upstate New
York because “the senator has been
successful in an appeal tothe fears of
people who are in a disturbed condi-
tion.“

Buckley. a Republican-
Conservative countered that
“momentum is clearly my way.“He
noted that he was trailing by I]
points in a poll a month ago but was
only four points behind by Sunday.
“Moynihan‘s campaign has lost
steam." Buckley said.

Moynihan said that Buckley had
“the voting record of an idcologuc.
of a man who fears the federal

government and doesn't think it is v

part of our system."

He said the senator's voting record
ranged from a zero rating from con-
sumer groups to only six percent ap-
proval from the National Council of
Senior Citizens.

Moynihan. appearing Sunday on
the WCBS-TV “Newsmakers”
program. maintained that he was not
attacking Buckley personally. but
Buckley‘s record in the senate. “Ifthc
record didn‘t exist.“ he said, “it
would be impossible to invent it.“

Moynihan also asserted that
Buckley is a Connecticut resident
who “has never chosen to represent“
New Yorkers.

over-all thrust of department in-
vestigations and prosecutions in the
field of organized crime. ‘

‘The nation's crime syndicates are
moving off the streets and into cor- ‘
porate boardrooms because they‘re
findingthat business frauds are more
rewarding than conventional
racketeering, said Waldman. “These
people go where the money is.“ he
said. “There‘s more money to be
made more quickly and with less risk
in the so-called paper crimes."

In the l970‘s he said, there has
been some shift in organized crime
that reflects changing times and
“personalities among the leadership
of organized crime. and changing
conditions in the country at large."

He said the old Malia families has-
ed on ethnic and blood kinship still
operate in perhaps two dozen cities.
But new “groups and combinations
of individuals who really transcend
ethnic lines“ are on the rise.

Crime syndicates are devotinglcss

loan-sharking and fencing
operations and turning to more
lucrative frauds involving cor-
porations and labor unions. Wald-
man said.

Mobsters have infiltrated and
taken over dozens or perhaps hun-
dreds of businesses and "we have
definitely seen an infiltration of
legitimate labor unions.“ he con-

 

tinucd. He refused to name corri-
panics and unions that have fallen to
the mob.

“The common type of scheme we
see is that they look for a business
that is heavy with assets but also
heavy with liabilities, so it can be
bought for a nominal amount plus
assuming the debts," he related.

“Then they don't pay the debts.

Commission 

WASHINGTON (AP) A study of
why the Postal Service is losing‘more

money each year -— when its goal'

was to eliminate deficits — should
touch off a major congressional
debate over its future.

The federal Postal Service Com
mission. expected to hold its first
meeting soon. is due to make
recommendations by March IS. The
commission includes seven voting
members representing business.
postal workers. and consumers.

The Postal Service can neither
raise mail rates nor trim services
while the commission deliberates.

The service was created in I97I.
replacingthe old Post Office Depart-
ment. with the goal of paying for
itself. To do this. the agency was
given powers to operate more like a
private business.

However. the Postal Service has

lost 83 billion in its ﬁrst five years.
and the deficits have been getting
larger. The corporation has avoided
insolvency only by borrowing from
the federal Treasury.

The I971 organization was based
on recommendations of an earlier
government commission, which said
postal costs could be reduced by at
least 20 per cent if the investments
and operating practices used in
private industry were made available
to postal management.

“Several years after the corpora-
tion is under way. therefore. it
should be able to eliminate entirely
the postal deficit, releasing over a
billion dollars a year of tax money to
other purposes." the commission
said. “The long-run potential forim-
provement. furthermore is so high
that we are reluctant to estimate its
size."

That commission‘s recommenda-
tion for a corporate-style mail agen-
cy received bipartisan support and
heavy majorities in Congress.

The new commision is likely to be
given various explanations about
why these predictions have failed to
Come true.

Postmaster (iencral Benjamin F.
Bailnr. a nonvolittg member of the
new commission. is expected to say
that ccomonic factors beyond the
control of the Postal Service are
responsible lor monnting deficits.

“i believe that ifthc old Post Office

Department had had to. contend
with the recent period of the energy
crisis. double-digit inﬂation and
recession. the nation‘s mail problems
would today be multiplied many
times over.” Bailar said in a recent
speech.

President Ford. a supporter of
postal reorganization as a con-
gressman, blames postal manage-
ment for the agency's problems. “I
just don‘t accept that they're doing as
well as they should be doing.“ Ford
has said.

Holding rates at present levels
would require massive increases in
the subsidies from the present SLS
billion per year. the General Ac-
counting Officc said. But if all sub-
sidies were tocnd by i984. the nation
would face the prospect ofu 34—cent
rate for first-class letters. the GAO
has estimated.

report.

The report blames an “avalanche
of ‘had press‘ articles" as a "con—
tributing factor in New York's
decline.“ and recommends a cam-
paign to promote positive aspects of
the state.

These include “vast amounts of

open and undeveloped land...a high-
ly skilled labor pool and an educa-
tion system unmatched in the ex-
ccllencc of its graduates."
The state has recently conducth
programs to promotethings“(irown

of advertisements around the theme
“New York Means Business."

Anderson called those “a minor
effort" and said. a “cap gun doesn‘t
amount to much when you're locked
in a total war.“
