9n. DBIPPINGS

‘Wisconlin genetor William Prox-
mtre is charging that the trans-
Alaskan pipeline has become I
“Golden Gobbler" before
Thanksgiving.

Proxmire says “This multi-billlon
dollar turkey should have been
plucked three years ago instead of
today when it's too late to undo most
of the damage."

Proxmire states he is upset about
the fact that. with the $8 billion
pipeline almost completed, the
government is suddenly reporting it
doesn't know what to do with most
of the oil the pipeline will deliver.

The excess oil will reportedly
create an oil glut on the west coast.
and there is serious talk about expor-
ting the domestic petroleum to
Japan.

Proxmire says that hearings
before Senate committees f orecastcd
this problem four years ago. but that
the Alaskan pipeline project was
pushed through anyway by big oil
companies and the Nixon ad-
ministration.

PLANT BEATINGS

A North Carolina gardening ex-
pcrt says that the best way to make
some plants grow is simply to
threaten them or even to beat the
daylights out of than

Fred Yodcr, a plant and flower
shop operator in High Point. says
that many plants and shrubs can be
encouraged with sweet talks llut. he
warns. “You can kill a plant with
kindness."

Yoder says that many llowcrs res-
poud only when threatened or at-
lacked. He reports of one instance
where a North (‘arolina larnter
became angry at an apple tree that
wouldn‘t prodttcc. year alter year.

Yotlcr states that the farmer "(lot
mad enough to take the blunt side of
his ax and beat tltc mischief out of
that tree." lltc l'ollowmg season.
Yotlt-i says. thctcrrilicd tree produc-
ed a neat record crop of apples.‘

IO GROWTH
A new Wisconsin study is
challenging the idea that certain
ethnic groups are born with lower

lQ's by showing that the IQ scores of
randomly selected black ghetto
children have been raised 20 to 30
points simply by their receiving
special training.

The study. conducted by Doctor
Richard Heber. is known as the
"Milwaukee Project." it involved the
selection of_two groups of 40 black
children at random whose mothers
measurcf in with IQ scores at less
than 75,

One groups received special train-
iitg from the moment of birth until
theycntered school. wltilcthc second
group received normal instructionin
the area in which they lived.

At the age ofsix. the childrenwho
received special training scored an
average of |21 on lQ tests. or about
21 poittts above the national norm.
'lltosc frotu identical backgrounds
but without any special training
scored an average of just 87.

Doctor Hchcr contends that the
study proves that so-callcd lQ‘s are
not fixed at birth. but can be in-
creased by training and by a
stimulating environman

SAINT CARTER

The bigpn bloc of voters going
for the Jimmy Carter ticket may be
coming from the ranks of some 50
million Americans who say they are
“Born Again” Christians.

Carter has stated on numerous oc-
casions that he is is “Born Again”
Christian who “found Christ". Now.
the Gallup Poll reports that nearly
50 million adult Americans. or more
than one-third of those who are old
enough to vote. have apparently ex-

perienced a religious conversion
similar to Carter's.

A Born-Again Christian. for the
poll's purposes. was defined as one
who has undergone a dramatic con-
version. who accepts Jesus as his or
her pcrsonttl savior. who believes
that the Bible is the nut horin for all
doctrine and who feels “an urgent
duty to spread the faith.“

If the survey of more than ISUO
scientifically selected persons is any
indication. says pollster (.ieorgc
(iallup. livangclical Christians com-
pose one third of Carter‘s built in
power base. making him. in (iallup‘s
words. a “Protestant .lohu I‘.
Kennedy."

l’m unhappy about the fact that I can’t see NBC’s live com-
edy show “Saturday Night Live" in this area.

i have seen the show elsewhere. and enjoyed it myself. i
know others have enjoyed it as well.

On behalf of myself and what I’m sure would be many
satisfied and enthused viewers and sponsors, I urge you to air
NBC’s “Saturday Night Live" show.

Sincerely,

A concerned Tri-city viewer

WE. CAME CLOSE

An attorney in the Pentagon
Papers case says he has seen Top
Secret military documents which
reveal that “in the past 20 years. the
world has twice come within 60
seconds of total nuclear annihila-
tion."

This charge is being made by
Daniel Sheehan. a nationally known
defense attorney who represented
Daniel Ellsberg in the Pentagon
Papers case and in the Ellsberg
break-in case. .

Sheehan. in an address at a con-
ference of the Church of Scientology
in Los Angelcs. stated he came
across Pentagon memos dealing
with nuclear alerts while researching
the Ellsberg case.

In one incident in 1958. he said.an

airline with engine trouble crossed
the l)|-IW (Distant Early Warning)
line between the United States and
Canada. Slicehan said that radar
wrongly identified the craft as a mis-
sile. and that a “full mobilization
status" was declared. The Top
Secret papers. he stated. indicate
that the US was within 56 seconds of
launching a full scale nuclear attack
against the Soviet Union.

HIGH ON GOGGLES

A llritish dentist has taken the
pleasures of psychedelics out of the
closet and is putting them to work
redttcing pain.

MeMuter has his dental patients
slip one pair of goggles. which are
hooked up to on clearic current.
When the «mantis switched on, in-

. stantly thousands of tiny. flushing.

colored lights suddenly appear on
the goggles. simulatinga psychedelic
trip. Within seven seconds. Mc-
Muter reports. the goggle-wearer
suddenly loses the ability to feel
almost all pain.

The secret of the dentist's success.
he says is that the electrical current
stimulates the brain to produce what
is called alpha waves. These are the
brain waves which produce keep
relaxation. and often sleep in the
body.

McMaster says he has practiced
the method on some l50 of his
patients. and that over 50 per cent of
them needed no anesthesia.

MANDATORY SEX

A Chicago psychiatrist is
suggesting that couples who are
married or living together should
spend at least a half hour a day
engaging in sex.

Loyola University Doctor
Domcena chshaw. who treats sex-
ual dysfunction. saysthat the trouble
with most people in our culture is
that we have tom many things to do.
and that sex comes last on the list.
Speaking before the American
Academy of Family Physicians in
lloston. chshaw stated that “I it our
time-pressured. work oriented
culture. we have a list of 23 things to
do each day. Number 24 is sex and it
can be erased if we'rctootircd or too
busy."

chshaw says that when treating
couples. one of'the first things she
does is ask them to set aside at least a
half hour a day for sexual activities.
Doctor William Masters. one ofthc
leading sex therapists in the US.
reports that at least 50 per cent of all
American married couples have
serious problems with their sex lives.
