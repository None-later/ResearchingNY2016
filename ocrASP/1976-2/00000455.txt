 , Rapists  Fearful?

by Tom Scherbsrtho

our campus is being hit with the shock
waves resulting from some violent attacks
upon women. Rape.'attempted rape. harass-
ment. and exhibitionism not only seem to be
the order of the day. but are topics of debate at
meeting and in the letter column of the ASP.

Throughout this excitement. various
theories and speculations are pouring forth as
to why rape occurs. Because this matter brings
forth strong feelings. and touches upon the
ever present controversy of women's libera-
tion. erroneous information——
unsubstantiated nonsense—comes ﬂowing
out.

For example. i gather from letters in the
ASP. overheard conversations. and a plethora
of supposedly funny jokes, many people are
convinced that the chief motive for rape is sex-
ual desire. When Susan Brownmiller. author
of “Against Our Will." spoke here last spring
on the subject of rape. someone actually stood
up and said that the attractive clothing styles
of women was an important cause of sexual
abuse.

These ideas have been refuted time and
again in studies of rape and rapists. but still
they persist. Long lists of books and articles
have been published debunking these myths.
but all of this still can't seem to put a dent in
the age-old distortions.

But is it any wonder? On TV, in the movies.
and in popular literature (including comic
books), what type of person is usually sexually
abused? Unattractive. middle-aged and old
women? Of course not; the question is
rhetorical. We are unccasingly barraged with
the notion that women just about ask for rape
by looking “sexually desirable". it doesn’t end
here. as many of us have discovered. another
widely held belief is that women enjoy rape
(we all saw that in “Straw Dogs". right?)

But why does the media repeatedly turn.

reality upside-down? Who‘s possible interest
could it serve to kcepthese outright lies alive?

THE voucsr YEhlJIlE‘t'RE
twist its war it artistes

As it turns out, there are quite a few people
who are very'interested in perpetuating these
ideas. In fact. you might say they earntheir liv-
in. bykeeping men convinced that women are
Marlon. Even decent-living capitalist
econombts will tell you that by keeping
women's wages low, wages for everyone are
k°lll low (if you don't trust me, take a look at
Samuelson's Economics). As long as the truth
about rape is hidden from men. they become
potential dupes for a society as eager to sup-
press them as it suppresses women.

Rape. expectedly. is a product of these
notions of divisiveness engendered by those
who control boththe media and our economy.
Just as whites had the fear of blacks instilled
in them during centuries- the fear that blacks
would steal their wives. thefearthatblacks
would steal their jobs. and deep down. the fear
that blacks might turn around and do to
whites just what was done to them- men have
been taught to fear any attempt at equality on
the part of women. They. too. will steal their

jobs; ideas of lesbianism will steal their wives;
and deep down. there is that fear that
“Women’s Rights" will mean the right to op-
press men. the same way in which men op-
pressed women over several millenia. Blacks
get lynched—women. raped. Rape has littleto
do with sexual desire; it‘s caused by the fear in-
spired by those who are better offwhen we are
divided; and it is the most violent act available
for keeping women afraid to fight for freedom.

The saddest fact of all is that the real beneﬁt
has been squandered by white men in their op-
pression of women and blacks. As suckers for
wealthy property owners. white men have
done their job of keeping alive is social system
which perpetuates slums. wur. hunger. and
disease well. Women and minorities have paid
a dear cost throughout history. but the
manipulation of the white male psychc.and its
transformation into a goon squad for the
forces of oppression. may in the long rim be
the biggest loss of all.

JERRY GWEN!

down washington,
up western

To the Erltor:

I've got an idea. Y'know those bitses that go
down Washington and up Western and down
Washington and up Westernand down Wash-
ington. The bus driver deserves a break. Why
not let them go down Western and up
Washington once in a while?

Look, if the buses alternate runs. one down
Washington and the next dowr. Western. the
drivers could see the other side of the yellow
lines, ﬁgure out new speeds forthetrafﬁc-light
sequences and wave to crowds of waiting com-
muters from different angles.

Those people who are unconcerned with
these'advances in the reduction of bus-driver
boredom may fancythespillovereffects of this
measure on their very own lives. Forexample.
suppose you live on Hillerest Avenue. a nice
residential section a few blocks west of
Brevator across from the State Ofﬁce Campus
entrance. To hop up toschool is no problem at
all since it‘s on Western and is the last off-
campus stop. Well. it‘s no problem on
Wednesday's at about 6:30 in the evening
when the waves of people are at low tide. Ad-
mittedly. this is of little use to those few that
have classes during the day. Then. of course.
there's always going home. Recent studies
have shown that a 40-minute bus ride to get
close to where you started has severe psy-
chological implications for the Western Man.
i have yet totake into account the strain this
new plan would have on the operating budget
to the transportation system. The increased
cost may force abandonment of the proposal.
After all. new schedules would have to be
printedand new signs made to replace the ones
which tell the commuter where the bus is head-
ed. like "Garage."

In addition. legalitaririns are concerned
with the establishment of what could be a
dangerous precedent. What would prevent
some radical, they argue. from proposing that
the Albany State Great Trains motor down
Madison once in a while?

difﬁculties . . .

To the Editor:

Do you value your eductition'! Would you
like to truly feel it‘s worth putting yourself
through school. both academically and ﬁnan-
cially? Upon graduating. would you like to
have the satisfaction of knowing that the
college education which you received was
something for which you were responsible? if
you have any of these aspirations or ideals.
you may as well forget them right now.

After working a full and part-time job this
summer to subsidize my education. i found
that l was ineligible to receive the National
Direct Student Lorin bectittsc my pitrcnts' in-
come was too high. My parents rarely see their
income before it is swalloWed up by bills. rind
the fact that l have never taken any of my
pttrcnts' money to pay for school was notcon-
sidcrcd. 'l'hus. most of mysavingit account wrrs
depleted after making the first semester pity-
inent which. by the way. was higher this year
due to the decrease in TAP and the increase in
tuition and room and board.

After realizing that i may not be irble to pay
for the second semester. to say nothing of the
coming years. i decided to seek help. What
better place to look than the Financial Aids
Office. right? Wrong. 'l'hcrc. l was told that l
was ineligible for any type of grant. Not only
that, but the only loan for which i was eligible
required that l begin to pay back the interest
rate of eight per cent while still in school. if

 

you don't go bankrupt paying for school. the
loans are sure to do the job!

Why not declare independence. you say? i
tried that too. Evenif i started declaring in-
dependence new, i would not be eligible for
aid until my Senior year. Declaring in.
dependence. from what i was able to ﬁnd out.
defeats its own purpose. First. 1 was told that it
“helps” to live off-campus in order to receive
aid. This inherently excludes any chance of
getting an RA job or cutting my room and
board costs in any other way. Secondly, it st ii.
dent must be able to prove that he or she has
enough expenses to be eligible for in-
dependence aid. ln other words. you have to
spend in order to receive. That makes very lit-
tle sense; the whole ﬁnancial aid system seems
biased. unfair. and self-defeating.

If my parents were poor and could not pay
my bills. i would receive grants. loans. and tin
almost "free" education. However. since my
parents are middle-class. makingjust enough
money to support themselves. although the)
have no obligation to support me. i must bi-
penalized. Consequently. my goals and cdtrcti-
tion must also suffer.

Idon'l expect the statcto completely [iil_\ for
my education. but. when | see people \ilio
don't even want to be in school hitting lllclr
education financed. i not literally sickened 1
don‘t want to take aid from those \t'lltlst‘
families can‘t afford to send thcm to \Clltiril
and who sincerely want to go to college. but I
do believe my position deserves some coir-
sidcration. Even a loriglcrm. low interest loan
with my own personal income would b.-
cnough to pay for school. Is this too iiitich to
risk? Apparently the state :ind illil\cl\tl_\
systems think so. Under such conditions. lllit.‘
can only ask what the standards of cdticritioii
are becoming. and what they will be like iii t he

almost homeless and in debt to everyone i
know (anavailable privilegetothose who wish
to utilize it) i would not have enrolled in the
ﬁrst place. All i want to do is get an education
so that I may get back on the tax rolls in the
State of New York. (1 think it is a pretty good
investment on their pan.)

Here's the killer; l was told by the welfare
department that if i will drop out of school.l
can qualify for aid and collect three grand a
year. Why, 1 could stay at home. drink beer
and watch the Flintstones on TVll

If you. the taxpayer are seeing red right
now. let me make a statement for the record: 1
want nothing for nothing. I‘m not a welfare
cheater eating up yourtax dollars. All i want is
a chance (and I‘m willingto work for it) to be a
contributing constructive member ofthe com-
munity. i think it is disgusting and disgraceful
that the system works against those wanting to
better themselves andfor those beer drinking
stay-tit-homcs.

Basically. here is the bottom line: I will
probably have to drop out of school. owing
the state about $800 for my louns. With my
school fees already paid and me not having t he
funds to complete the semester. I feel that New
York State has ripped me off for a nifty 800
bucks- not bad for seven weeks of
work. My only consolation is that I hope the
state administers these funds properly ton sec-
tor in which they are needed.

if I do have to drop out of school. I will
not go on trial/lire: l‘ll starve first.

Ttr the Editor:

I haven new toast to all of my middle class
I “friends” who have always resented their
lprircnts‘ funding of my college education
l (through their tax “burdens.” of course) . . .
You should be pleased to know that Your
iloly Establishment is doing its best to drive
off rill the most destitute financial aid
recipients this full. You see. all financial aid
applicants must rtpply for a Basic Educational
Opportunity Grant before rtny other award of
financial aid will be considered. The lower
oiic's (or one‘s family‘s) income. the greater
the llEOG rtwnrd. Thus. the greater the
dependence on that particular form of l‘iniin-
cittl aid. "But." yotr say. “so what”! it is it grunt.
after all!"

Well. my friends. here is the catch. At this
tiiirc there ttrc over 200 students iit this school
irionc whose checks itrc still not in due to “cut-
brtcks in personnel." Amazing how no one
knows where the checks are. what exactly is
holding them up. or when they crtri be ex-
Pccted. The student affairs revolving loan
fund has long been exhausted due to the ex-
traordinary dcrntind. Need I add that those
who are "blessed" with this grant are also
those with the lcrist access to loans from rtllcr-
nittc sources. And. in case you‘re still worried
about those with slightly higher incomes. they
httvc experienced a similiir plight with the
Nrttionttl Direct Student Lorin... clrt-i'rs!

l'm sure everyone has seen those “Rent A
Person” signs on the podium. Besides ti few
puzzled glances. and several cries of 'Kinkyl“.
I'm afraid that not much attention has been
given this project nor its sponsor. in brief. the
“Rent A Person" project is comparable to a
“slave auction.” in that students volunteer
themselves (for a two-hour time period) tothe
highest bidder. This project'is designed to raise
money. which is subsequently put in the
treasury.

The chain doesn't stop there. That money.
along with other funds obtained by the club is
used for many community services. such as
entertainment for underprivileged children.
bloodmobiles. etc.

Partly out of curiousity. i attented last
Wednesday‘s meeting. It seemed pretty sad to
me that attendance was not greater. although i
suppose that one must attribute this. to some
extent. to the lack of publicity. The fact that
few people actually know what the Circle K
club is and does probably also contributed to
the poor showing. Circle K. as lfound out, is a
service organization geared to helpingthe en-
tire community; volunteer programs at a ger-
iatric home and with retarded people were be-
ing set up til the particular meeting which I
attended. i must admit thrtt l was impressed by
the willingness of the members to help out in
the various programs discussed.

Tampering With Tenure

in the wake of SUNYA President Emmett B. Fields‘ retrenchments
and program cutbacks, the State Board of Regents has delivered yet
another blow to the faculty. in its statewide plan for post-secondary
education, the Regents has suggested that the proportion of tenured
faculty at any one college or university be limited. instead of tenure
some faculty members would be offered a five year contract. At the end
of the five years the university would have the option of renewingtbe ap-
porntment.

The Regents claims that this will extend the probationary period for
faculty and allow the university greater ﬂexibility in decisions concer-
ning staff.

For a university, flexibility means having the power to hire and fire at
will — without the restrictions imposed by a tenure system. Older. but
untenured faculty can be shipped out to make room for younger people
with innovative ideas.

For SUNYA faculty, this ﬂexibility would mean giving an already
powerful administration even more control. it would mean a significant
loss in job security. it would make SUNYA an unappealing place to
work.

The American Association of University Professors has already ex-
pressed its dissatisfaction with the amount of power SU NY ad-
ministrators presently wield. Specifically, the AAUP has asserted that a
retrenchment clause in the collective bargaining agreement between
SUNY and the faculty makes it too easy for administrators to get rid of
tenured faculty. Limiting the proportion of tenured faculty and thereby
increasing administrative control over the teaching staff as a whole
would only further the AAUP‘s discontent and increase SUNYA’s
chances of being placed on the association's censure list. AAU Pcensure
is meant to inform members of the teaching profession and the general
public that unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure
exist at a particular institution. A place on this list would not be helpful
in attempts to recruit new faculty.

The Regents proposal could create a dangerous situation for post-
secondary education in New York State. especially at SUNYA. Lowjob
security compounded with AAUP censure would predispose high quali-
ty professors to pursue job opportunities elsewhere. And high quality
students would soon be predisposed to follow them.
