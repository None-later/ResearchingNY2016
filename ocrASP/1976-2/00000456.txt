SUNYA‘s renowned Psychology depart-
ment is well intothe ﬁnal month of a ﬁve-year,
seven million dollar research project studying
the graffiti on campus bathroom walls. The
department has released tentative ﬁndings
that shed new light on one of the least un-
derstood spheres of campus activity.

Hidden cameras and sound equipment
coupled with a painstaking analysis of in-
dividual grafﬁti provided the hard data for the
Porcelain Report. which has been denounced
by civil libertarian groups as an infringement
on the right to privacy.

Researchers who had hoped to link an in-
dividual’s personality to the nature of his
bathroom scrawl were surprised to find that
differences in graffiti largely depend upon
social groupings. Grafﬁti in the Business Ad-
ministration huilding. for example. consisted
mainly of drawings. the walls being devoid of

handwriting. It is surmised that the accoun-
ting majors who dominate this particular
edifice lack the intelligence to learn how to
write.

Similarly deficient scrawls were discovered-
in the first floor bathrooms of Social Science.
where many Geography courses are held. This
indicates the relative illiteracy and lack of
sophistication ofthe upstaters who make up a
high proportion of this department's majors.
the report explained.

0n the other hand.just a few yards away. in
the Administration. a veritable plethora of
writing was discovered. Dr. James DeGer-
mani the famed SUNYA social psychologist
who headed the study. says this suggests that
“administrators have so little work. they spend
their time in the restroom releasing their
frustrations."

Dr. Dchrmani highly praised the
“anatomical drawings“ coveringthc Fine Arts‘

walls. He stated that Art ranked second only
to the bathroom outside the ASP offices.
“This indicates that either newspaper people
are extremely creative. or are just plagued by
anal fixation.“ said DeGermani.

A follow-up report counts toilet flushes to
identify which groups produce the “most
waste." Surprisingly. it was bathrooms next to
the Psych classes that finished first in this
category. Administration toilets copped se-
cond. while those adjacent to the Central
Council meeting room wound upa close third.

Witter pressure was contrastineg high in
the Bio building. Researchers feel this is due to
the intense studying and worrying involved in
Bio courses. factors producing poor appetites
and uneven digestion.

 
 

 

Results were inconclusive in some spots.
Bathrooms in RCO-dominated hallways
yielded indecipherable scribble. DeGermsni
fears RCO majors have forgotten how to use
ordinary English in their communications.

The report saysthat bathrooms are effective
vehicles of social interaction. Toilet stalls are a
major gathering place for the University‘s gay
community.

Dr. Dchrmani. Ilushcd with success over
his ﬁndings. hopes next to investigate the
“differentials between sexual group com-
munication in SUNYA waste facilities."
DeGermani will continue his attempts at
sociological classification. “I want to prove a
pet theory." he says. “that the grafﬁti of Long
Island girls consists solely of shopping lists."
