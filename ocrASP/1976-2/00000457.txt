And ED MOSER
- The past weekend saw a series of
beneﬁt shows at the Eighth Step
Coffee House at the Trinity
Methodist Church on the corner of
Willett and Lancaster Streets in'
downtown Albany.

According to Mickey Anderson.
Festival Coordinator. the beneﬁt
originally began because the coffee
house needed to do some renovation
work in the kitchen. It- has now
become an annual event occurring in
thefallofthe year. lnthis. their ninth
year. they plan to put the money rais-
ed toward a sound system.

The ﬁrst group to play on Friday
night. Oct.22. was Huxtable.
Christensen. .and Hood. Their
specialty was English and traditional
music as well as 50‘s swing. Unfor-
tunately. Terry Huxtable had
laryngitis and could only play the
piano. Carol Christensen played the
accordion for some songs.
Huxtable. Christensen. and Hood
have been together about 2% years
and have been performing about two
years. Although they started out do-
ing unaccompanied traditional
music. they have done Bohemian
carols. madrigals. French folk songs.
and SO‘s-type music.

The most striking element of their
performance was their beautiful har-
monizing ability when doing songs
a cappella. The beautiful lilting
quality of their voices is reminiscent
of Prelude or Steeleye Span. Their
primary emphasis is on British
ballads. but they also did a 50‘s song;
(i.e. “I've got your picture—she's got
They also did a Stephen Foster
song and a blues number by Jellyroll
Morton. The audience chuckled
when the 50‘s song was dedicated to
the head lifeguard at a pool where
one of the singers hung out when she
was 16. The song was complete with
“bawp do wops."

Next on the agenda was Wendy
Grossman whose specialty is Irish
and English traditional music and
contemporary American folk.
Although the first banjo song. “The

 

Lark in the Morning” was somewhat
strident. the rest of the performance
smoothed out the rough edges. One
Scottish banjo song “Molly Lee”
drew good response from the
audience who sang along with the
chorus. and the song. “The Vampire
Rag.“ appropriate enough for this
time of year. got lots of laughs from
the audience.

The last group to perform Friday
evening was the Pumpkin Hook Str-
ing Band. Their forte is country

   

dance music. Three men and a
woman performed on guitar, banjo.
recorder. and fiddle and sang. They
played traditional and bluegrass
music as well as a “West Virginia
Mining Disaster" song. Their perfor-
mance was pleasant but not outstan-
ding.

The audience. which numbererd
between 25-35 people. seemed to en-
joy all the performances equally.

her guitar accidentally when she
looked at her watch. She seemed to
be suffering from “Ford's disease.“
The Saturday shows were studies
in sonority. as all three acts peform-
ed laid-back country-folk.
Minnesotan Scott Alaric came on
in an almost schizophrenic manner.
His songs. like those of the other
acts. were of a quiet. extremely
serious nature. His audience. on the
other hand. was corny. irreverent

. tolomon
and chatty. In a voice that seemed
extremely mature. like that of a
thoughtful old man reminiscing over
his live. the youthful Alarik
touchineg sting of lovers’ pleas for
understanding and of miners
tragically buried in cave-ins.

In between the songs. though.
Alttric made fun of those popular
targets. John Denver and Troy.

Alaric that because. Gerald Ford
played center on his college football
team. the President fell “into the
habit of seeing thing backward."
By the end of the set, Alaric‘s nut-
tiness spread to his music. as if he
couldn't keep his different styles
apart. One of his last songs began
solemnly enough as a ballad about a
dead man “buried under a pine tree."
The chorus, however. surprised
those expecting further gravity:

"They built a Howaer Johnson's

Alaric‘s closing song was the
strongest of the evening. Jane Voss‘
lovely "Keep in Mind". The musi-
cian got the ninety or so people in
Saturday's audience to sing along.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

OCTOBER 26, 1976

By ANN BROOKS

Experimental theatre has long
been regarded as a distinctly new and
exciting adjunct to theatrical art.
which often acts as a catalyst for its
development as a vital art form.
Here at SUNYA. Experimental
Theater has served as a showcase for '
up and coming student directors.
playwrights. and actors. Despite a
minimal budgetary allowance
(tickets are free). SUNYA Ex-
perimental Theatre has been
characterized by creative. joyous
and polished productions.

“When you Comin Back, Red
Ryder?”. a drama by Mark Medoff
that won critical acclaim in New
York. is a two-act play; an adven-
turous undertaking for Experimen-
trrl Theatre. The play deals with’l'cd-
dy (John anpe). who terrorizes a
roadside diner and physically and
psychologically tortures ts in-
habitants until they (and we. the
audience). come to some significant
personal realization.

The script. however. leaves runny
questions unanswered. Motivations
are unclear: the action is on one
tedious level of tension. until it corn-

 

es to a screaming climax for which
we cannot be prepared. The resolu-
tion leaves us unfulfilled. un-
satisﬁed. and uncomfortable. '

Director Randy-Barbara Kaplan.
the talented director~choreographer
of last year's “America Drinks and
Goes Home". seems to have en-
countered several problems in the
almost Herculean task of mounting
a play with built-in directorial dif-
ficulties. Kaplan has been unable to
extricate the production from the
trap of one-dimensional action (par-
ticularly evident in the first act). and
characters. There is no establish-
ment of a tempo that can move us to
a believable pinnacle of tension. Her
actors exploded all at once. leaving
us confused as to how and why they
did.

Lappc. us Teddy. the local
character of the show. was perhaps
the most disappointing. Front his en-
trnncc till his exit. he played on one
level of emotion, His performance
was wanting for the physical ﬂex-
ibility necessary for the role. He fell
into very predictable \octrl patterns
and seemed to ultcrmrtc between
several. equally predictable. fucitrl

was adequate as Cheryl. his
girlfriend. and although her New
York inflections were distracting.
she remained believable and
touching.

Jeff Brower gave a dull and incon-
sistant performance as Stephen] Red
Ryder. slipping in and out of his in—
terpretation of a Midwestern drawl.
There was no real fear of humiliation
when Teddy harassed him. and he
lacked the sense of inadequacy that
should have been the cause of his
bravado facade.

The crippled proprietor of the gas
station and motel played by John
Murray. had a good sense of the
kindliness and simplicity that was
basic to l.er Striker. Douglas Albert
as the “Snydlcy Whiplash" manager
ofthc diner was so stereotypical that
he was ridiculous. Even his make-up

Etheridge lacked the" comp and

Altman mated an excellent and
very funny facade. In spite of his ﬁne
timing. his performance ‘ lagged

his wife. Clarisse.

ed by her husband until Teddy
destroys that trust and forces her to
assert herself. She. too. seemed to
lose vocal control in the fight scene.
but Beechart handled her recovery
mtrturely and believany as she did
when Teddy wrenched up her blouse
to expose her bare breasts.

Elizabeth Mulctrhy gave a
wonderfully sensitive performance

who loves Red Ryder. She was

“When You Comin Back. Red

our expectations as a dramatic piece.

From the moment Teddy entered. >

there was atension that never resolv-
ed. A drama ofthis sort should have
a cathartic effect on us all. because it
touches us at such a basic level. In-
stead of a sense of release. however.
we feel one of loss. The purpose of
this emotional tirade on the actors
and the audience is unclear and lacks
focus. All the vehement energy has
been to no avail; we feel no catharsis.
