new YORK (AP) The New York
Rangers have lost four of their last
ﬁve games and the slump apparently
has produced tension between the
players and fans at Madison Square
Garden.

Nick Fotiu. a Ranger rookie who
grew up rooting for New York as a
fan in the old Madison Square Gar-
den. went after a fan Sunday night
following the team‘s 5-4 loss to the
Vancouver Canucks.

Fotiu raced across the ice when
the game ended and started climbing
into the stands. but teammate Ken
Hodge interceded and led him to the
dressing room.

“The fan called me a 'goon.’ ” said
Fotiu. a native New Yorker.

“instead of helping us and becom-
ing a part of the team,they‘re against
us." he complained. Fotiu. who is
used mainly as a reserve by Rangers
Coach John Ferguson. said.
“They're hurting us. I'm nojerk and
that guy swore at me.“

“We‘re in a slump. They should
cheer us up and help us. Do they
think we want to play badly on pur-

Fans Heckle Rangers.

pose?”

Goalie Gilles Gratton had
something else to complain about
after giving up goals to Dennis
Vervcrgaert. Rick Blight. Chris
Oddleifson. Garry Monahan and
Ron Sedlbauer.

“Too many guys are standing
around the net," said Gratton.

“I feel like a jerk back there.
Sometimes there‘s three guys around
me. On one goal. nobody touched
the post. nobody touched the point
man and nobody touched the slot
man. We have seven rookies on this
team. They're young and make mis-
takes. but I need a little help."

Phil Esposito, who scored two
goals for New York. didn‘t talk
about the fans and most of the other
veterans were quiet on the subject.

But rookie Don Murdoch joined
the conversation.

“it‘s different here.” he said.

“in juniors. everyone understood
when a young player made a mis-
take. Here. the fans don't unders-
tand. We need conﬁdence. a boo:.t to
get us goingand we‘re not getting it."

The big play came when DeBlois
picked up three yards on a fourth
and one play to keep the drive going.
Brewington also made a big con-
tribution when he kept the ball
himself and ran around left end for a
27—yard gain to Norwich l2.

Ahonen carried next and
appeared as if he might spring loose.
But all he picked up was two yards
before he spiked the ball to the
ground. The ensuing un-
sportsmanlike conduct penalty sent
Albany hack to the 25 where they
were stalled. Leibowitz's 39-yard
ﬁeld goal attempt was blocked. and
Albany never seriously threatened
again.

“It‘s been a disappointing season
to date.” said Ford. “We‘ve got the
potential but we jmt haven't been
putting it together. A portion of it's
my fault but i guess we all have to
assume some part of the blame.

“Things just fell apart in that se-

Brewington. “It‘s tough to come in
