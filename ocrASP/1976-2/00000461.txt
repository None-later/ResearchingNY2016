front of Geneseo forward Chip;
Reist. Reist eyes the ball. then the
goalie, then the twenty pairs of eyes
upon him. Dario Arango, Albany's
netminder, focuses his gaze on the
ball. and nothing else. Reist aims
and kicks. The ball is ﬂying toward
the upper right hand corner of the
goal and so is Arango. who deflects
the ball away from the net with his
ﬁngertips. The penalty kick has been
blocked, the game saved.

The Danes, with a little help from
Dario. defeated Geneseo Saturday.
3-2. in a well-played, poorly of-
ﬁciated game. The result was a com-
bination of all factors, with the save
on the penalty kick the key play.

First half action was fast and
aggressive as two evenly matched
teams battled for victory. Reist
opened the scoring at 16:07 of the
ﬁrst half. assisted by Bob Behren.
Just 35 seconds later. the Danes. not
to be outdone. tied the game. Frank
Selca. assisted by Jose Ruano, beat
Mark McNiven. the Geneseo
goalkeeper, to knot the score.

Later in the ﬁrst half. Geneseo
came downfield. challenging the
Dane defense. To play it safe. goalie
Arango called for the ball from the
Albany defense. Arango came out of

  

the net for the ball. but'could not
control it. Bob Ceran, ’_a Geneseo
forward, came up with it and knock-
ed the ball into the open net.

After the game. Albany Coach Bill
Schieffelin commented. “Dario
should not have called for the ball. it
was a mistake, but he made up for it
in the second half. especially on the
penalty kick save.“

The miscaII cancelled out what
had been a one goal edge. Albany's
Paul Schiesel had found the net
moments earlier at 33:33. This time.
it was Geneseo who had come from
behind to tie the game.

in the second half. Selca touched
the ball with his hands and was
awarded a yellow card, a warning.
from the referee. when Nick
Ditaranto. a Dane defenseman. tn-
quired why the far official made the
call instead of the near one. he too
was given a yellow card. Danecoach
Schieffelin was displeased at the dual
warnings. but did not argue.

However. just minutes later.
Geneseo was awarded a penalty
kick. The official instructed both
teams not to touch the ball.
DiTaranto then moved the ball to
where he thought the ofﬁcial would
want it placed. He was issued a se-
cond yellow card by the official and
was therefore ejected from the game.

AMIA: Ofﬁcially Speaking

It goes without saying that of-
ﬁciating is one ofthe most important
links in the AMIA (Association of
Men‘s intramural Athletics) chain.
The use of referees and umpires is
what sets intramural activity apart
from commonplace pick-up games.

Any student taxpayer can be
employed as an AMIA ofﬁcial. and
in as manysports as he or she desires.
The average pay is approximately
$2.50 per game which is far above
minimum wage when one takes into
consideration the fact that most con-
tests take less than one hour to com-
plete.

Officiating also gives a person an
outlook not ordinarily seen; that of
being in control of a game and hav-
ing to deal with the various com-
plaints filed by overzealous com-

petitors. It can truly be unenlighten-
ing experience; and make one think
twice about yelling at the likes of

Coach Schieffelin stormed on the
field and asked the ofﬁcial where in
the rulebook it says two yellowcards
equals a red card. which means ejec-
tion from the game. The officialjust
said that that is the rule. Schieffelin
continued, “That is a high school
rule and nowhere in the college
rulebook does it say that two yellow
cards equals a red one.“ Schieffelin
then protested the game.

portant. as it might also count as a
SUNYAC playoff game. The validi-
ty of the protest will be decided this
week. The penalty shot by Reist was
blocked by Dane goalie Arango. The
score remained deadlocked at 2-2.

Cadet Rally Nips Danes, 24-20

by Mike Plekarsltl

It was an exeeilcnt first half for
Albany Great Dane football. They
had travelled all the way up to
Northfield. Vermont and had been
taking it to the Norwich Cadets in all
facets of the game. And when
fullback Tom Debiois crashed over
from the seven with 21 seconds left.
Albany had built up a ten point half~
time lead.

But football is a game of two
halves. Norwich played both.
Thanks to two touchdown runs by
Cadet halfback Don Brown and the
aerial accuracy of Walt Houghtal-
ing. Norwich was able to come from
behind and defeat Albany 24-20.
Saturday. at Sabine Field.

The loss left the Great Danes with
a record of 3-3 on the season with
three contests remaining.

“itwasacombinationofthings.“a
disconsolate Albany coach Robert
Ford explained afterward. "We mis-
sed Brad [Aldrich] and Brew——
substitute quarterback Fred
Iirewington~—went in and fumbled a
couple of times. Then. when we had
first and ten on the Norwich 12.
Dave Ahonen picked up two yards—-
he almost broke it loose—got a little
carried away. and spiked it. Well.
that's a 15-yard penalty and pulled
us out of range,

“Defensivcly. we had not one of
our better games. We did some
things chI but not consistently."

These "things" that the Danes did
do well—such as score-~came only
in the first half. In fact. Albany
threatened to blow the Cadets off the
field in that ﬁrst halt"; not withstan-
ding the Norwich cannons stationed
at either end of the ﬁeld.

On their very ﬁrst offensive series,

the Danes were ablcto convert. With
Aldrich directing the show. Glenn
Sowalskie. Orin Griffin. and a
returned Tom DeBIois started
marching the ball upfield from the
Albany 20. Two ﬁrst downs later.
Albany had the ball on their own 45
before Aldrich pitched out to Griffin
on the outside.

The fleet—footed sc nior then cut in-
side, eluded tackicrs. and romped 55
yards for the touchdown. Dave
Ahonen's conversion puss offa fake
extra point attempt fell incomplete.
as the Danes led 6-0.

After Norwich was forced to punt
on the ensuing kick-off. Aldrich
again took over the reins. and led his
“horses” downfield for another
score.

DeBlois. back in action after his
shoulder injury. started the drive
with an 18-yard burst up the middle.
to give Albany a ﬁrst dOWn on their
own 48. Two pitchouts to Ahonen
and Sowalskic and an Aldrich
kccpcr. brought the bull down to the
Norwich 23. DeBlois picked up eight
more before the Cadets‘ defense
stiffened. Larry Leibowitz then
entered and booted the first of his 32-
yard field goals. and the Danes now
led 9-0.

But the scores did not come
without a price. With 9:22 left in the
first half, Albany defensive halfback
Billy Brown was racked up on a play
and was carried off the ﬁeld. it was
later learned that his left leg was frac-
tured and that he will be out for the
remainder ofthe season. It was to be
an omen; but not one immediately
apparent.

Brown's replacement. freshman
Daryl Haynor. made his presence
felt immediately as he picked off a

Walt Houghtaling pass and returned
it to the Norwich 24. Three plays
later, I.eibowit1.~~who lends the
Danes in scoring- rackcd up his 2lst
point of the season with his second
32vyard field goal. With 32 seconds
remaining in the first quarter.
Albanylcda stunned Norwichsquad
by a score of I2-0.

It looked like the lead would grow
even larger. Once again. the Dunc
defense held the Cadets and forced a
punt. But this one proved costly to
the visitors. With the ball bounding
toward the end zone. Albany deep
back Ray Gay attempted to pick it
up and run it upﬁeld. Instead. he
fumbled it, and Norwich recovered
on the Albany nine: ﬁrst and goal.

Two plays later. halfback George
Egbert banged in from the five. Dan
Kulak's extra point was good. and
Albany now led by only five. With
four minutes left in the half. Paul
Robichaud. brought up from the
Norwichjunior varsity. booted a 44-
_yurd field goal with the aid of wind
and now it was a two point Albany
lead.

0n the following kickoff. Tom
Clcary made a spectacular 60~ynrd
return to the Norwich 42. and
Albany had one final scoring oppor-
tunity before intermission. They
didn't waste it.

Sowulskic picked up a first down
on athird and five situation. Ahonen
picked up another on an Aldrich
pitchout. and Aldrich himself gained
yet another on a keeper play.

With 21 seconds remaining.
Delilois then bulled his way into the
cndzone dragging two defenders
with him. and Albany was now
ahead by six. Then came an in-

Committee Suggests Fieldhouse Funding

by David Cross

The Student Recreational Center
Committee (SRCC) has proposed
transfer of state land to UAS for use
as collateral for a bank loan to
finance proposed construction of u
ficldhouse on campus. accordingto
SRCC member Greg Lcssne.

Lessne estimated that the
ficldhouse would cost $2 million to
build. He said UAS would repay the
loan with a voluntary or mandatory
student tax of six to ten dollars per
student each semester until tllc loan
was repaid.

Some members of SRCC have ob—
jected to the proposal. According to
member Cary Klein, it would be
wrong to obligate future students to
pay a mandatory tax. He said that
students not usingthe athletic facili-
ty should not be forced to payafee.

Klein said that although a
ficldhouse is needed at SUNYA.“we
must decide where our priorities lie."
He said that with some departments
being cut out of the curriculum. he
did not think SUNYA should spend

an additional $2 million on athletics.

The original plans for the uptown
campus included a ficldhouse.
Lessnc said. but ductolack of funds.
it was rtcvcr built.

Increasing intramural and litter-
collegiatc team use and physical
education classes have reduced
recreational use of the gym.

Concerts and Speakers

A ficldhouse would alleviate some
of these problems. Lessne said. It
would also be used by Concert
Board and Speakers Forum as an
auditorium.

According to Lessnc. the propos-
ed fieldhousc would be used for non-
intcrcollegialc sports. Plans call for a
design similar tothnt of n ficldhouse
at Boston College.

The final decision concerning the
ﬁcldhouse will be made by the stu-
dent body in a referendum sometime
in the future. Brochures. slides. and
film presentations are being
prepared by SRCC to inform
SUNYA students about plans furthe
ﬁcldhouse.
