applied for abserttee‘ ballots for the
upcoming presidential eleaiona may
not receive them intlme to vote.
SA President SteveDlM’eo said he
has a list of people who have not
received either their, ballot or an
application for the ballot. r
According to SASU coordinators
Kathy Baron, who worked on the
SUNYA registration/absentee

 

  

ballot drive. two basic problems.

caused the current trouble.

Onewas that the various county
Boards of Election did not p've
SASU a sufficient number 'of
applications for absentee ballots.
This necessitated ‘the' complex
process of mailing for request
applications.‘ sending thos
applications back and receiving the
actual ballot.

Baron said the county Boards
“were not prepared to handle the in-

 

flux of registrations and" ballot

applications.” "

NYPIRG President Kevin Kovacs
said that the Putnam Coutuy Board
sent to applications from this school
back to the Registrar’s Oil‘Ice.~
. “When I called, sclerk hungup on
me. Our lawyer called, and all I6
ballots were mailed special delivery."

According to Tom Wallace of the
State Board of Elections. the board
was swamped because of the large
number of registrations. new
procedures (new deadlines for
registrants and the' September
primary). the fact that court
decisions were still chang‘ng the
names on the ballot. and a severe
lack of manpower.

The registration forms and ballot
requests from this campus were sent
in well before the deadline according
to Baron. “The latecomers were in
the last batch sent out about three
weeks ago. and the bqu of them. in-

cludingthe hundredsto Nassau. Suf-
folk and Queens were sent out a
month and a half ago.”

According to DiMeo. SA aims to
contact everyone who's called in a
problem and check if they have
received their ballots yet.

DiMeo said. "Anyone receiving

an absentee ballot tomorrow or'

Saturday can bring it to the SA of-
fice and we‘ll contact them and I'll
personally take them down to the
post ofﬁce on Broadway and make
sure they get out by Sunday night.

After the election, NYPIRG plans
to get the names of everyone who

was inconvenienced. Armed with
these names. NYPIRG will institute
an after-the-faet class action suit
against the State Board of Elections.

Kovacs said. "We worked very
hard on this [voter registration] and
we wanted as few foul ups as possi-
ble."'

OCTOBER 29. 1976

 

   

NEW YORK (AP) Peter. Peter,cur-
curbita eater. Then there's the
“Legend of Sleepy Hollow" in which
a ghost throws his curcurbita head at
Ichabod Crane.

Or, how about Cinderella's golden
coach fashioned by the good fairy
from a curcurbita? Doesn‘t ring
quite true. does it? "Curcurbita,"
however, is the scientiﬁc name for
"pumpkin." It‘s not all that
scinetiiic, though. since “curcurbita”
means both "pumpkin" and
"squash." 0

Imagine, the lowly pumpkin.
every Halloween witch‘s favorite
vegetable—or is it a fruit—has no
scientiﬁc name of its own. Botanical-
Iy speaking. there is no distinctioh
between squashes and pumpkins.

Somebody ought to do something
about it. but before they do that.
they‘d better decide what word
"pumpkin" itself means. You see.
there‘s no agreement onthat.eithcr.

The word upumpkin" is a culinary
term, and botanists don‘t find it very
precise. What do they know? They‘re
the ones who settled on “curcurbita.”
The name appears to come from the
the Greek “pcpon” or “large melon"

 

 

by way of the French which con-
verted it to “popon" and then “pom-
pan" and eventually “pumpion.“
The ending was converted to "kin" in
the American colonies and
"pumpkin" became a word. In
Shakespeare's “Merry Wives of
Windsor," there is a reference to a
“gross, watery pumpion.“ That
sounds mighty like a melon.
Melon 0r Squash?

But anybody who's ever carved a
jack o‘lantern knows that a pumpkin
is not a melon—or a squash either.
And besides. when the Greek word
“pepon” was doing all that evolving.
there weren‘t any pumpkins in
Greece, France or even
Shakespeare's England.

The pumpkin. you see. is as
American as. cr—well. it‘s as
American as apple pic—maybe even
American—er.

According to the Univer Fresh
Fruit and Vegetable Association,
archeological diggings in North
America have uncovered pumpkin
remains between 7,000 to 5.500
B.C. But the pumpkin didn't
get from the New World to the Old

’ World until the end ofthc 16th Cen-

I’    

tury. Nobody-knows what the str- .

ropeans did for jack o'lanterns until
then—perhaps they carved up

cucumbers. They're curcurbitas. too.

. Define Pumpltln

Dr. Ashby M. Rhodes of the Un-
iversity of Illinois seems to sum up
the argument over how to deﬁne the
word "pumpkin" with uncommon
clarity for a botanist: “All edible
members of the genus curcurbita
may be 'considered squash.
However. the round orange fruits
used for jack o‘lanterns and pies are
generally called pumpkins.“

We need more men like Dr.
Rhodes. men willing to call a
pumpkin a pumpkin.
