SCREWED,

Alabama Governor George
Wallace has ﬁled a $5 million libel
suit against the publisher of Screw
Magazine. complaining that the x-
rated publication has illegally used
his picture to promote its sales.

In his suit filed in a New York
State court, Wallace states that the

 

magazine. in four consecutive issues.
printed a picture of him sitting in a
wheel cltair. above a caption reading
"If I could. I'd run for Screw
Magazine.“

Wallace‘s complaittl also chttrges
that the magaline incorrectly claims
tltal the goternor is a regular Sub-
scriber. and denies an allegation in
the printed ad which claims that
Wallace“picked upa few pointers on
sex tricksY' from the publication.
Wallace states that he does not sub-
scribe to Screw.

POT DRY SPELL

High Times magau'ne is reporting
that the United States is in the midst
of what it calls a severe “marijuana
drought" . . . with no endinsight.

The publication says that the nor-
mal yearly cnd-of—summcr pot shor-
tage is now extending well into the
fallthis year.and is likelytocontinuc
or even get worse.

High Times blames the scarcity

   
   
   
 

  

mainly on the federal government‘s
campaign to prevent the import of
the illegal weed from Mexico.
Columbia and the Caribbean into

.the United States.

The magazine. in its current issue.
suggests the only solution to the pot
shortage is for smokers to plant "vic-
tory gardens" full ofthe evil'weed in
their backyards or inwindow boxes.

BEATLE TAPES

A new Beatles album. called The
Bea/les- Tapes. is scheduled for
release shortly in the United States.

As you might expect. the material
on the double LP will not consist of
new Beatles‘ songs. Instead. most of
it is made up ol‘impromptutapcd in-
terviews with the Beatles recorded
prior to their break-up.

Included are John and Yoko lying
in bed talking about impotency:
I’tiul McCartney diseussittg his per-
sonal life and his family; and George
talking. about his religion.

The interviews are mixed with
some Beatles tunes played by an
orchestra. All of the material was
recorded by British pop journalist
David Wigg. who was a friend ofthc
lads front Liverpool during the
|9(i0's.

Both Ringo and George have
attempted to stop the album from
being released. but the courts have
dismissed their objections.

CHINESE SEXISM
Feminists in Rome are charging
that Chiang Ching. the widow of
Mao Tse-tung. is a victim of sexism
rather than ideology.

Chiang had been recently reported
in the Hong Kong Press has having
been "liquidated" for being a'
member of an anti-party group of
radicals who had allegedly
attempted to prevent Hua Kuo Feng
from taking Mao‘s place as chair-
man of the Communist Party.

The Women‘s Liberation Move-
ment in Rome. however. issued a
statement charging that “The
Chinese revolutionaries are
demonstrating the same attitude on
sexism as capitalist bourgeoisie."

The Italian feminists charged that
Chiang is being criticized “not
because she is a dissident
revolutionary but because she is a
woman . . . and for not being a
sweet and silent companion of a
great man."

HEARTY APPETITE

Onions and garlic may be bad for
the breath. but‘thcre is new evidence
indicating that they may help pre-
vent heart disease.

The British

medical journal

 

Lancet reports that a team of
researchers in India compared the
medical histories of 45 persons who
regularly ate onions and garlic with
35 others who deliberater avoided
the two foods.

The researchers say they found
substantially lower levels of

cholesterol and other fatty sub-
stances in the, blood among the spice
eaters. The journal concludes that
onions and garlic seem to work in
some mysterious way to help prevent
hardening of the arferies.

C.I.A.. WE HEAR YOU

Information published in Popular
Mechanics magazine could enable
anyone to intercept top-secret
massages from the CIA. Interpol.
and dozens of other internationales-
pionagc organizations.

According to author Anthony
Curtis. ham radio operators have
been picking up,"cloak and dagger
radio signals“ on their short wave
sets. which are said to originate with
the CIA and U.S. military bases.

Curtis adds that while the call
letters remain the same. the dial posi-
tion changes occasionallyto stay one
step ahead ofthe eavesdroppcrs. CIA
station K-K-N-S-(l. for instance. has
been logged at nine different spots
on the short wave band. The author
says these CIA radio stations are
“only the tip of an iceberg in the
ocean ofsupcrsecret transmissions."

If you are lucky enough to find
one of the “cloak and dagger"
stations. though. you must then
figure out how to decode the
message. which is eitherjust a series
of numbers. radio—teletype. or inter-
national code. Occasionally spoken
words can be picked up. but they
may not make sense to the amateur
listener. Curtis says.

Popular Mechanics also says that
the International I’olice Consor-
tium. Interpol. maintains at least
three dozen frequencies in Europe.
and that Interpol stations from
Kinshasa. Zaire. and Lima. Peru.
have been picked up in the U.S.

KIRLIAN PHOTOS

Three scientific researchers are
out with a new study which con-
cludes that ‘ there is nothing
mysterious or psychic about Kirlian
photography.

Kirlian photographyis a relatively
new photo procedure. deVeloped in
the Soviet Union. through which
many researchers believed they had
actually photographed the “Aura of
life" given off by all living things.

Using electro-magnctic fields and
photographic plates. Kirlian
photographers were able to capture
on film colorful. energy-like ﬁelds
emanating from living objects.

I-IoWever. scientists John Pchek.
David Faust and Harry Kyler report
in Science magazine that they have
solved the Kirlian mystery. They
state that the colorful auras captured
on.t‘ilm scent to be caused solely by
the amount ofmoisture and salt con-
