By JON R. HAND

The invention of the motion pic-
ture around the turn of the century
was, at first. a mere mechanical ex.
tension of photography: a succession
of still images creating an illusion of
movement through proper projec-
tion. When this initial scientific
curiousity had ended. film pioneers
immediately began thinking about
how they could economically benefit
from this new kind of illusionism.

The answer to their inquiry im-
mediately arose from theater and
literature. or at least one major
aspect of them. If the succession of
moving frames could tell a story.
then perhaps profits could be

Modern Music

By FRANK DORIS

With the release of their fourth
album. Modern Music. lie-Bop
Deluxe. a relativer unknown band
from England. will undoubtedly es-
tablish themselves as one of the
finest third-generation bands to
emerge from the Seventies. This is
largely due to the guiding influence
of their songwriter-guitarist. Bill
Nelson. who not only writes unique-
ly distinctive songs. but is a virtuoso
electric guitarist. He is one of those
select few. like Jeff lleck or Larry
Coryell who can do things with the

 

capable of even imagining. And the
rest of the batid. Andrew Clark
(keyboards and synthesizer).
Charles Tumahui (bass. vocals). and
Simon Fox (drums. percussion),
complement him perfectly.

Nelson is one of the few musicians
who use the recording studio as an
instrument in itself. lie uses the full

fruitful. audiences favored this new
type of story-telling. And once the

entertained the soul with a story.

For most people this method of
the early film appeared natural and
easy to accept. Why not go to the
movies to see a story‘.’ In keeping
with the Reiiaissaiice-llaroque tradi-
tion. the narrative film prove-gt to be
a marvelous creation. However. in
the eyes of a modern artist the
adherence to a plot was a s'ellitig out
of the mcdium's true power and in-
dividualism. fills becomes especially
true when compared with other
twentieth century experiments intltc

powerful the medium was tn render-

espcrimciitatioii. however. led only
to the refinement of the narratitc-
film structure: if the disctwery did
not lend itself to the enrichment of
plot and cliat'actcrt/ation. then it
was dropped. And to someone like
(iril'l’ith. a breakthrough w tthediting
(cross-cutting. parallel action.
decomposition) meant a
breakthrough with the treatment of
the story.

Yet. in on; respect. their first
results were already ancient.

The early development of cinema
had little in common with the
modernist approach. The beginning
of the century witnessed the destruc-
tion ofmuch previous tradition. Ina
courageous effort to capture thetrue
essences of aesthetic meaning and ar-
tistic form. painters. sculptors.
architects. writers and musicians
began to eliminate romantic and
classical elements from their work.

Artists like Kandinsky. Brancusi.
Gropius. Joyce and Schoenberg
wanted to establish new rules. new
composition and new universal ar-
tistic truths. Their revolutionary
tone was plain and simple: the
scenario is pushed aside for formal
concentration.

If the discovery ofthe motion pic-
ture had conic earlier the rise of its
atant-guardc movement would have
been delayed. Only because ofcxter-
nal influences from other media did

and Richter developed the more
elaborate scroll painting : a long roll

these alternating and eontinuom

was achieved when the speetator‘s
attention shifted from one form to
the next. The results were still quite
primitive. and Richter felt that the

motion picture camera could ‘
provide the proper solution. Their -

next step is cinematic history.
Richter abandoned the earlier
more complicated type of drawing
and instead used the simplest of
geometric shapes suitable to the film

the succession of static imnﬂ

from science. however. is obvious.

_The Riehter-Eggeling works

simply explore the relatiotlhips of

They are not mere animation nor are
they scientific curiousities.

Their primary imponance lies in

Food Queries?

students on the plan to kcepthe food
service‘s iticomc at a high enough
level to operate efﬁciently. However.
Clough stated that if the feed.
back through the food committees
indicatesthat the students would like
an optional meal plan. then con-
sideration would be g'ven to the
proposal. “We try todetermine what
is best for the student. lfthc students
don‘t like it. we're not goingto do it."

I asked Clough why the
kosher meal plan was only at one
quad (Dutch Quad). thu.. making it a
great inconvenience for those on the
plan lived downtown. Clough
replied that in order to extend the
plan to other quads. special cooking
equipment Would have to be in-
stalled. which would cost a lot of
money. This couldn't be done
without significantly raising the cost
of the kosher meal plan. Clough
also mentioned that the food service
lost in excess of $20,000 last year
from the kosher meal plan. and to
extend the plan to all the quads
would only increase the loss.

UAS, which runs the food ser-
vice. does not make money on the
students from the meal plan. Last
year. a rebate was given to the
students because UAS (then
FSA) made too much money. Any
excess money at the end of the year is

used as capital for the next year. ac-
cording to Clough. who also
stated that the rebates were given last
year because it is the view of UAS
that the money should be given back
to the students rather than used as
additional capital.

It is a general misconception that
the food at the Rathskeller is better
thanthe food onthequads;'l'he food
comes from the same place(the com-
missary on campus) and is of the
same quality. The big difference ac-
cording to Mr. Clough. is that the
food at the Rat is prepared to order.
while at the quads. the food must be
cooked in advance because of the
large number of students that have
to be served. This is why the grilled
cheese may be cold. or the pancakes
hard.

Clough stated that he “wants
to be lead by the students‘ wishes."
and that the food service “tries to get
personal withthe students at each in-
dividual quad." According to
Clough. if the students think that the
food service is doing something
wrong. then they should let them
know about it. either through the
food committees. or by using the
“beef board at each quad.
Clough‘s last statement was. “The
food service tries to please the
students. If it wasn't for them (the
students). I wouldn‘t have a job."
