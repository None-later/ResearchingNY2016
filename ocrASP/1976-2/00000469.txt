thing was that they were not there to protest
the arrest of the students, but instead turned
the whole activity into a forum for the YSA. l
was not alone in objecting to the unfair way in
which the YSA was taking advantage of an un-
fortunate situztion, as someone else tried to
point out that the abundant posters and
literature about the YSA present were
political advertisements which had no place at
a function of this kind.

Granted, in any demonstration many diver-
sified groups will get together to protest. and
many willcarry placards identifying who they
are. but the YSA took it to such an extreme
that it was abusive to those students who were
morally compelled to protest. I don‘t like be-
ing accosted every time I walk through the
Campus Center by someone making a sales
pitch waving The Militant (newspaper) in my
face. and I am sure nobody else does either. I
am also sure that no one else wants the YSA to
take advantage of them in this way, or to in-
terfere with any activity they have planned.

white is wonderful

To the Editor:

I wish to express my thanks and apprecia-
tion to the administrative genius who was
responsible for having the bars in the Dutch
Quad cafeteria painted white. I really think it
was a bright idea since we didn't have enough
white paint on this campus already. I really
deplore contrast and sterile white is my
favorite color. Isn't it yours'! Most students
spend a great deal oftimc in the cafeteria, and
I think it‘s wonderful that we can all go
snowblind together.

I have one further suggestion that would
make our campus an even more exciting place
to be. In addition to having our cafeteria
covered with white paint, how about making
all the food white? Great, huh?

environmental
expenence

To the Editor:

The people ofthis country are frequently ac-
ettscd of being apathetic. whereas in truth.
they merely lack direction and leadership.
When someone decides to become involved.
he may find that there is no organization

waiting for him and welcoming him with open‘
arms. This kind of frustration and disappoint-
ment inevitably leads him back to inactivity.

One problem that faces us all, as in-
dividuals, as a nation, and even on a world-
wide scale, is that of the environment. The
massiveness and complexity of the situation
makes it difficult to know what to do and
where to begin. Dealing with it on an in-
dividual level is fairly simple. Turning off
appliances and lights that are unnecessary.
and cutting down on the nae of paper goods
and plasticthrow-awaycontainers presents no
great hardship or sacrifice. But what about
those who want to do more?

Traditionally. there have been environmen-
tal courses offered at SUNYA that enabled
students to learn more about the problems, as
well as to become actively involved. Unfor-
tunately, the budgets have been cut and after
next semester the environmental program will
be entirely phased out. Even though the
money has run out, the environmental
problems have not.

Right now, the Albany County En-
vironmental Management Council is organiz-
ing a project for student volunteers. it will in-
volve two or three workshops, and then
students will be sent into the suburbs and city
of Albany to survey and assess the various
areas in terms oftheir ecological and historical
value. The work will be worthwhile both for
the students involved and the entire communi-
ty.
If you think that the pressures of your
academic life are too great to devote time to
this project, think again. If you sign up for
Community Service, November 2- ~5, through
Ms. Hedi McKinley, you can receive thrcc
credits for the work you do. Teams oftwo will
be scnt out tocovcr various lots of land,so you
might want to sign up with a friend. Or sign up
illtHlU, illld lllUCl someone nUW.

In any case. take advantage of a chance to
have a worlhwhile learning experiencc,to help
your community. and to get three credits
without the drudgery of textbooks. class-
rooms, and exams.

Innovative Voting

Before voters go to the polls next week, they shOuld examine the.
candidates to determine who will be most innovative. It's easy for.
candidates to talk about plans for needed changes, but only the man who, '
is resourceful enough to implement those plans will be a quality
President. The innovative man has the ability to take what is bad and '_
make it good, and then take what is good and make it better. '

Yet as the media have exposed them, there is no parameter by which
to judge a candidate's innovative quality, or lack thereof. The televised
debates have befuddled voters with statistics. promises and allegations.
But no matter. Such expressions are more reflections of calculating
research staffs and speech writers than of the candidates themselves.

The problem is that today's voter needs a means of measuringthe true
mettle of a candidate’s creativity. Apparently, none exist. Such a
measure should be found not in a sampling ofa candidate's words, but in
a sampling of his behaviour.

Surprisingly enough, a solution to this age old problem lies in one of
man‘s age old inventions—the calendar. Careful scrutiny of the calendar
makes it obvious that some time-plotter foresaw the problem and built
in to the schedule ofevents a tailor made remedy. Election Day falls only
a few days after Halloween~a day preserved in our society for the
expression of the inner spirit.

Ask not what the candidates said or did on the news or in the papers,
ask instead what they did on Halloween. Only on this day will their
innovative tendencies be evidenced in their purest form.

For men and women from the city, the heartland, the corn belt, the
bible belt and the borscht belt, Halloween has a way of bringing out
other wise suppressedcreativity. Some dress up in costumes, pretending
they are Napoleon, Mary Hartman. Pluto the Wonder Dog or a Ritz
Cracker. Others quietly remove themselves from the company oftheir
peers and indulge in private, dastardly fantasies—switching signs on rest
rooms or dropping banana peels along the path of the walk-a—thon.
Some outfit themselves in Godzilla suits and go door to door delivering
Candygrams to diabetics. lrmovation is abundant.

Find out what Ford and Carter do this Halloween. lf For'd suits up
like a Mustang II, he is obviously not the man for thejob. The same is
true of Carter if he goes dancing through the farmlands of Georgia
dressed as a pain pill or a peanut shell. -

So cast your vote for the man dressed like the Marquis de Sade,
complete with whips, chains and crotchless underwear, chasing senior
citizens around a nursing home. Surely, this man will make a fine
President.
