 . As the I976 Presidential campaign
draws to a close. a most important question
remain unanswered: Where has the lnpslra-
tlon that we once got from our leaders gone?
Neither candidate has succeeded in per-
wading us that he is any different than the
other—dull. self—centered, insecure. vindictive
bullshit artists who have marched on and off
the American political stage in recent years.

Next Tuesday there will be little excitement
or anticipation as a nation exercises its
precious right to choose a leader. instead. we
will shed a collective sigh of relief; knowing
that the commercials will cease. the pollsters
will no longer tell us what to think. and the
names Carter and Ford will stop echoing in
our heads like drops from Chinese water tor-
lure.

Why are we continually faced with a choice
between the lesser of two evils? There are
several reasons which might begin to answer
that question:

I) Of all the important foundations suppor-
ting democracy. the right of free speech is the
cornerstone. We may express our opinion on
any subject at any time (within reason).
without fear of rcprisal. But shouldn't
politicians enjoy the same freedom? Ofcourse
they should. Why is it then that politicians

r  moieties ‘*

by Todd Miles

don‘t openly tell us what they'rethinlcing? To a
great extent. it‘s because the American public.
spurred on by the news media. ﬁnds some
pretext for criticizing or ridiculing every word
that politicians say. Criticism and ridicule are
useful tools for analysis and humorous com-
mentary. but when they go so far as to publicly
humiliate and insult those who aspire to public
ofﬁce, what is the result? Creative and ar-
ticulate people shy away from the public
spotlight; leaving the vague. calculating. dull-
witted bureaucrats forming today‘s political
Establishment.

2) Politics is often thought of as “a diny
game played by power hungry elitist snobs
bent on self-cnrichment and personal
gloriﬁcation at the public‘s expense". This
characterization of the process through which
we organize and conduct our government has
been assimilated into every institution of our
society; from the family. to the education
system, to the working world. The inevitable
result is that our brightest, most capable peo-
ple devote their time and energy to secure-
moncy—making careers. America has more
gifted human resources than any other nation;
doctors. engineers. social workers, lawyers.
rcscarchcrs in every field. theorists and
philosophers of every type: yet our govern-

OCA' Advisor

Many off campus student are not aware of
their rights as tenants. There are laws and
court decisions protecting you from unfair
landlord practices. An important legal in-
novation is the recognition of the “implied
warranty of habitability” by 26 states
(including NY). This law states that a landlord
is obligatedto maintain a habitable dwelling if
rent is to be collected from the tenant of that
dWelling. A habitable dwcllingis onethatcon-
forms to the local housing code of the com-
munity.

The “implied warranty of habitability" also
provides for the tenant three means of dealing
with a landlord who does not make necessary
repairs:

1. You can make the repairs at your ownex-
pcnsc and deduct that amount from the rent.
(You should also send a copy ofthc bill to the
landlord.)

2. You may withhold the rent and lot the
landlord sue you. defending yourself on the
grounds of breach of habitability. (Don‘t
spend the rent moncywthc court could order
you to pay back all or part of it).

3. You may sue the landlord for breach of
contract.

Remember . . . beforctakingany ofthcse
actions. you must inform the landlord in
writing of your intent. It is also advisable to
consult a lawyer or check with the local tenant

association. .

New York (and 24 other states) protect the
tenant from retaliatory action by the landlord
after the tenant files a housing complaint.This
means that if you report a housing violation
the landlord cannot evict you.

Another source of landlord-tenant hassling

'involves the security deposit. You have the

legal right to get your entire security deposit
back when you leave. if the condition of the
dwelling is the same as when. you rented it
(allowing for normal wear and tear).

A good way of protecting yourself against
unfair damage claims is by makingacheck-list
of the condition of yo’c'tr dwelling before you
sign the lease and having your landlord sign it.
In addition. if you obtainva receipt for your
security deposit. or have any unreasonable
damage claims. lfthe landlord does not return
all. or part. of your security deposit (minus a
fair estimate of the damages) you can try to

,rccover the deposit by going to small claims

court.

You are entitled to “quiet enjoyment“ of-
your dwelling. This means that you can pursue
your own style of living if you do not disturb
anyone. do not damage the property. and pay
your rent on time. if. however. your dwelling
is uninhabitablc. you may withhold all or part
of your rent without facing legal com-
plications.
