Nonuch‘ ° Hurt Team“ “  ' '
by Mike rams: " ‘
Sure, Kick a team when it's down. Tell them they're bad. It's easy; anyone
can do it. But take a look at the other side of the coin; tin people who are

losing. Can you? '

What we are talkingabout is the Albany State varsity football team. a team
that is not really losing. but is having its problems this season. Last
Saturday's 24-20 loss to Norwich dropped the Great Danes' record to 3-3 on
the season—something far short of their 7-2 and 9-0 records of the pasttwo
seasons.

But is it fair to compare teams? Graduating players and differingschedules
make any comparison an academic one. And yet. there seems to be one thing
this year's Albany team has that previous Albany teams also have had.
Something that ties them all together. In a word. it is “pride.”

Pride is something that transcends the concepts of winning and losing
football games. It is one of the intangibles that makes one football team stand
out from another. Pride is something that makes a team jell; that makes it feel
it can win no matter how bleak things may look.

Pride is also something that makes a team almost incapable of accepting
defeat. And when one does accept it. pride is the factor that.makes one
resolve not to let it happen again; if there is any way to prevent it.

Pride is something that has characterized Albany football teams since Bob
Ford took over head coachingduties here six years ago. And this year's team
is certainly not lacking it.

Sat urday’s loss pointed out somethingabout the football program that has
gone virtually unnoticed since football was instituted here. Before the
Norwich game. Albany teams have never relinquished a lead In a football
game that they have not were Think about it. Every time the Danes have had
a lead in a game. they have never been beaten.

‘ That is a fact that has spanned graduating classes. coaches. and schedules.
Has that been due solely to talent; to good personnel? I think not.

And the fact that Albany did lose the lead and the game to Norwich six
days ago is something that had to hurt the players: maybeeven more than the
consecutive shutouts earlier in the season.

The Great Danes are a cohesive unit—possibly even more socially than
athletically. 0n the field. they are part of the team; a unit with a collective
goal in mind: to win. There is a feeling of cooperation; of purpose. A feeling
that says: “I'm going to help you; I‘m going to block for you;to complete our
play; to win our game."

It is the same off the field. There is such an abundance of rapport among
the players that it seems infectious. In the cafeteria. in the bar. they are
friends. After the game is over. they do notjust dress and leave; they go with
catch other; they live.

And it isjust this sense of “oneness” that makes the Great Danes something
special. When the ball games are over and the last tackle is made. no one will
really remember it. It was only it game. But what wc.as fans. can remember is
that Albany football was a winner no matter what the score. And that. I
think. is something.
