‘ Bums, Williams axed

by Rich Sellpon
In their best team effort of the
season. the Albany State cross coun-
‘ try squad convincingly defeated
Siena. Union. and RPI on Tuesday
toend their regular season mark at 5-
6. The Danes retained their title of
Capital District Champions in the
blistering cold and windy weather.
The scores of the meet were: Albany
30, Siena 45, Union 66. and RPI 83.
"We took charge team-wise right
off the bat.“ said Danecoach Robert
Munsey. “At the 2-milc mark (5.05
mile course). I knew we had them
beat.” Individually. however. no one
had Siena's Tom Dalton beat. in this
second annual championship. The'
freshman won the personal title by
about 50 yards. defeating Albany's
ﬁnest. Chris Burns. in 26:]2. Burn's
time was 26:23.
Matt Williams. the Dante's terriﬁc

freshman barrier. came in third place
in 26:29. Munsey lauded Williams‘
performance this year: “Matt won‘t

let up; he improves a little moreeach ‘

time, Having him around next year
won't hurt a bit."

Two Union runners. Stan
Wiskoski and Kevin Scheuer. ﬁnish-
ed in 4th and 5th place respectively.
Sophomore Mark Lavan of Albany
was the Dane‘s third top barrier on
this skin-shivering day. ending the
race in 6th.

But it was three other Albany
runners. who really “wrapped it (vic-
tory) up." said Munsey. Mark
Dalton. Eric Jackson and Kevin
Burnett took 9th. tom. and llth
place. respectively. Jackson, a
senior. showed improvement in the
last three weeks and completed his
final regular season meet on a
positive note.

Albany sandwiches a stone barrier as the lleltl of runners In Tuesday's Capllal District
Championship nears the cathode lake.

For Chris Burns. there were both
positive and negative feelings about
this meet. Losing ﬁrst place to
Dalton had to be disappointing to
the Dane‘s senior star. but in fact. it
really wasn't that surprising.
Murtsey explained. “I thought Burns
would win it. but he doesn't run well
in bitterly cold weather. They (the
opposition) were also all keying in
on him."

The good news for Burns though.
was that he became the 4th leading
Albany winner of total dual meet
races in their cross country history.
(Burns was credited for two dual
meet wins in the quadrangular

meet). Chris recorded l2 victories in
his three-year varsity career. from
1974-76. (Thomas Robinson is far in
front with 2i. from l962-64).

Top Five?

Tomorrow is the Albany I0tb An-
nual Invitational. featuring 32
schools. which includes women.
junior college. junior varsity. and
varsity divisions. There are l7 varsi-
ty squads challenging each other for
the crown. with the University of
Massachusetts and Keene State
College, N.H.. as the favorites. As
for Albany. the mannt the helm gave
his prc-meet view. “We‘ll tryour best
to get in to the first five. l hope we

retell

sneak in. but it's going to be a
struggle."

A struggle is what this year's
Albany cross country crew have
been going through. After losing
theirﬁrst six meets. they had tocome
back from adversity. which they did.
triumphing in their last five dual
meets. And for Munsey. although
this is his first losingseason in fifteen
years. he looked to a bright spot. He
chuckled. “At least now we have a
win streak going." It will stay that
way now. but as next September
comes around. the barriers will have
to show it on the course to keep the
streak alive.

Gridders Take On Albright

 

Danes Must Stop Power Running Game

The Albany (ircat Danes football
team invades the “Lions den” Satur-
day. as they tttkc on the Albright
College Lions in the 26th annual
Shrine-I’rctrel llowl game in
Reading. Pennsylvania.

Albright. 5-l on the year. is
currently sixth in the Lambert llowl
rankings and is coming offa 24-7 vic-
tory over Wilkes College.

The Great Danes. meanwhile.
have fallen back to the .500 mark (3-
3) with their hcnrtbruking 24-20 loss
to the Norwich Cadets. Inst Satur-
day. Albany led 20-l0 at the half
only to crumble like a ltousc of sand
in the second half. The Dttnes do.
however. seem to have shaken offthe
loss ttccording to offensive coor-
dinator John Crcit and are mentally
ready for Albright.

The Lions. who beat the Danes
last year 28-8. are a very strong and
well-cottchcd squad. according to
Crcu. Statistically it would seem that
way. Albright has scored l55 points
while yielding only 55 to their op-
ponents. They average almost 350
yards a game -~«mnin|y on the
ground» and their only loss of the
year was by a slim four point margin
to Gettysburgh. Albright also owns a
victory over the ninth ranked team in
the Lambert llowl. Lycoming
College.

The Lions hang their hats on their
ground game. This means Albany
will see a lot of Frankie Franks and
.lcff Welclt.

Great Danes hit the dummies In preparation for Saturday’s game at
Albright. Danes will try to rebound from loss to Norwich.

Franks is the “home run hitter" in
their offense. according to defensive
conch Al lingnoli. gaining 649 yards
to date for an average of 6.5 yards a
carry and six touchdowns.

Franks is a speedster and will be a
constant outside threat. The other
halfback in this wishbone offense is
Jeff Watch. The Danes cannot take
him lightly as his combination of

outside and inside running have
amounted to 475 yards. Fullback
Dnn Dnly complements the other
two fine runners as he has picked up
2l4 yards on just 48 carries.

Moynihan Defeats Buckley In Senate Race

NEW YORK (AP) Daniel Patrick
Moynihan wrestcd it Its. Senate
scat from Republican James
llucklcy l'ucstlay.

Moynibnn. n flamboyant
sociology prolcssor who had
dabbled ill government for years
before unsuccessfully hccamc
only the second Democrat elected to
the Senate from New York in the
past 25 years.

He mounted a traditional. liberal
Democratic attack on Buckley's cott-
scrvativc view. .' accused the one-
term senator of neglecting the needs
ol the stale. liut his victory was
fueled in large part by the
widespread publicity be won as US.
ambassador to t he U nitcd Nations
onc ol scvcrnl positions he had held
under Republican administrations
in Washington over the past eight
yctlrs.

His most famous moment at the
lJ.N. came with his speech against
the rcsoltllion that labeled Zionism a
form ol racism.

ll Wits after that speech that the
idea of a Senate candidacy came to
[)thL'I'llii party leaders eager for a

 

centrist candidate to run against
Buckley.

The built-in advantage was
Moynihan‘s appeal to Jewish voters.
who make up a large group of the
state‘s voters.

“We fought for the center of the
Democratic party." Moynihnn told
supporters in a victory statement."
The national government is our
government. too. New York has a
claim to make on it."

llucklcy conceded defeat. but
promised his supporters that “We're
going to be there pushing our points
forward. This country is going to
continue in the direction of the con-
servative cause.“

Buckley. who captured more than
40 per cent of the vote in his race
against Moynihan. said. “I intend to
continue incvcry way I can to repre-
sent your interests."

llncklcy. 53. was defeated in I968
when he ran as a Conservative
against Jacob Javits. Two years
later. still on the Conservative line.
he captured a winning 39 per cent of
the vote in a three-way race for the
