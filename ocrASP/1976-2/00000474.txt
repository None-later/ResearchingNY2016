African republic of Burundi was overthrown by the army in a bloodless coup
Monday, a broadcast from Bujumbura. the capital. annoumed yesterday.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) The lower house ofthe Indian Parliament. with
‘most opposition lawmakers boycotting. yesterday passed a constitutional
amendment giving Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s government virtually

ALBANY. N.Y. (AP) National fraternities and sororities are expected to

In one of the closest presidential

prize. At this writing. all the results

News might not be for some

highlighted some of
the more questionable aspects ofthe
American electoral system.

In nearly l5 states the popular
vote was so close that it can be

from that state. In Hawaii. with 99
per cent ofthe vote tabulated. Carter
was awarded four electoral votes

A more glaring example occurred

in some of the bigger states‘that con-’ ’

trolled rtearly 113 electoral votes.

. InaNew York. Michigan. Texas
and Illinois. the margin of popular
vote was less than 100.000. In Ohio.
the difference was less than 5,000
votes; in Maine. less than 1,000
votes.

Indeed. it is conceivable that
President Gerald Ford could have
won the 'popular vote while losing
the contest in the all-important elec-
toral college.

Three times in the l9th century a
candidate won the popular vote but
found himself onthc short side ofthe

Turnout Damaging

Most nntntctn' analysts hcrc.

heavy voter l urnout. especially It) the
overwhelmingly Democratic areas
of ethnic New York City. would be
damagingto Buckley. As the evening
wore on. the ballroom swelled with
reporters.

lly l):|0 p.m.. tltc traditional
regiment of conservative supporters
had appeared: stout men in
pinstripe suits with silk ties and gold
pins. handsome women with pearl
earrings. and younger supporters
straining for freedom against the

chatted casually sipping rye and
gingers. tapping their feet to the
strains of "For Once Ill My Life"

immense hall.

At 9:30 p.m.. NBC predicted
Moynihon's victory. It came as no
surprise tothc people here. As David
Brinkley announced it they accepted
their fate and quietly as the ancient
grccks accepted the verdicts of the
Delphic oracle. A few heads
dropped. and eyelids drooped for a
longer second. Now. they sought
other consolation.

But the band played on. roaring
through renditions of “Love Will
Keep Us 'I‘ogethcr." “The Hustle."
and “On a Clear Day."

At I():l5 p.m.. Boh Mnckcn.

mind. When asked about the op-
pnrcnt unconccrn of the Buckley
supporters. he responded. “These
people are dedicated loan ideology.
not a man. Their hopes can‘t die
with the decline of one titan."

Moynihan a Phantom

Clifton White. noted conservative
ndvisor to Ford and Buckley. told
mc. "We were running against a
pltnntom. Moynihan never left liar-
wild. We could never pin him down
in New York. The people don't know

Buckley was on his way. apparently

Soon. roars rang up lrotn the
crowd. “We want Buckley.“ and he
arrived. He walked into the large
room smiling broadly. He walked up
to the stage. kissed his wife nndjoin-
ed hands with his family.

"Jim. Jim.“ the crowd called.

He made his speech.

"As one who has ndmircd Daniel

speaks out for freedom in the United

him a copy of my book . . . We‘ve

can be challenged. But so far. only
New York with a large bloc of 4|
electoral votes is being subjected to
this procedure. .

In an action initiated bythe White
House. New York State Attorney
General Louis Lefkowitz called for
an impounding of the state's voting
machines. The tallies are to be check-
ed for irregularities. In addition. a
large number of absentee ballots
could swingthe popular vote over to
Ford. giving him the state's 4| elec-
toral votes.

It may be days before an official
decision on the status of New York‘s
vote is reached.

Although other states have not yet
followed New York‘s lead. they still
may.

All this wouldn't be necessary if
the government operated by its own
maxim of “being for tire people. by
the people and ofthe people.“ Why is
it that the electoral college and not
the people choose the president?

The electoral college has been
around since ratification ofthe U.S.
constitution in I789.

The framers of the constitution
apparently felt the people could not
be responsible enough to vote direct-
ly for the chief executive. Instead. a
system of electing electors to decide
the presidency was instituted based
on the population ofeach state. The
number of congressmen plus the
state‘s two senators are added
together to determine the number of
electoral votes each state has.

Surprisingly. the issue of
abolishing the electoral college was
not raised during the campaign.
During the I968 campaign. the elec-
toral college became a significant
issue with George Wallace's strong

'l'hc superficiality of political vic~

last night at Daniel I’. Moynihnn's
campaign headquarters in Manhat-
ton.

'I'hc newly-elected
Senator's election
headquarters was
probably one of the
least lavish in recent
history: It bore storefront. witltlloor
tiling missing in some places and cc-
ntcnl showing through.

Massage parlors are visible from
the front of the headquarters which
is loctttcd two blocks north of 42nd
Street.

Inside. hung a carefully-
constructed television backdrop
which appeared on television last
night. It was by far the most colorful
thing in the room.

The three major networks and
PBS were set up across from the
speaker's platform. Behind the
cameras was a battery oftelcphoncs
and TV monitors. Entrance to the
headquarters was restricted to
members of the press and certain
campaign workers. There were
always about l5 to 20 people looking
in from the sidewalks through the
front window.

Deputy Press Secretary Meredith
Wheeler said. “I tltink the large
[voter] turnout helped Moynihan
because of the larger Democratic
registration state-wide."

bid to throw the election into the
House of Representatives. When
this did not materialize. the issue
quickly disappeared.
Heavy Voter Turnout
One of the major issues of this
year‘s campaign wasthc lack of voter
interest. But preliminary figures in-
dicate this election had one of the
largest voter turnouts in recent
history. This has been attributed to
the last polls that showed Carter and
Ford in a tight contest. I’sy-
chologically. the turnout increased
as the people perceived that their
vote might “count” after all.

It seems that every presidential
election spawns questions about the
electoral college. Yet in the past.
there hasn't been any significant
move by either the House or the
Senate to act on this problem. In
light ofthis year‘s close race the issue
is bound to come up again onlyto be
lost in some congressional subcom-
mittee; it remains to be seen whether
congress will act on a system that is
clearly antiquated and give the peo-
plc the rigltt to really choose their
president.

ed a little more. She said “There‘s
always news in the candidate‘s state’
ment. It demonstrates a certain flair
that he has." As to wltat function the
media served. she said. “I think we
serve art ambiance function. In other
words. we give the people at home
who can't be hercaﬂuvor ofthe cum-
paign. and a certain reality which
they cannot receive at home."

Fleischer noted that through the
night the people at Moynihan head-
quarters announced only favorable

information. such as the fact that in
Washington Heights. which is large-
ly a Democratic district. the vote was
about 4000 for Moynihan to 100 for
Buckley.

Perhaps the fact that two blacks
were the first speakers emphasized
the fact that Moynihan was tryingto
overcome the effects of his “benign
neglect" report to President Lyndon
I). Johnson a few years ago.

First Co-chnirman of Citizens-
for-Moynihan Bernard Gifford said
that victory for Moynihan appeared
to be "uniform and comprehensive."
This is because better than 85 per
cent of the Jewish vote and 77 per
cent of the Black vote was for
Moyniltan. Then Senator Joe
Gallagher. a friend of Moynihan's
from high school. spoke.

The only time the headquarters
came to life. before Moynihan‘s
appearance. was when it was an-
nounced that tow trucks werctowing
away illegally parked cars outside. A
$75 ticket.

Finally Moynihan came in and
made his victory statement. He said.
“New York was on the ballot and
New York won . . . I will use my
head and my elbows on behalf of
New York in the Senate. I hope to
speak in Robert F. Kennedy‘s tradi-
tion."

Then Ilayon Rustin. another
prominent black leader. spoke. He
said. "Moynihan was what the poor.
the blacks. and the minorities need-
ed."
