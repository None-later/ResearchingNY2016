A newly formed University com-

ccpl of what constitutes a basic
liberal arts education.

The President‘s Special Com-
mittee to Review the Undergraduate

Adkins and Skip Slyﬁeld last spring
while stumping for the top two spots
in the Student Government at the
University of Texas (UT).

At the outset of the campaign not
many sharpies were placing bets on
the Arts and Sausages Party that
Adkins and Slyﬁeid promoted. Even
less took them seriously.

Undaunted. the Arts and
Sausages combed the campus, per-
forming guerilia theater and sing-
outs. hosting question and answer
periods and theatrical skits.

The party platform promised eu-

God has continually acted in creation calling men. Throughout time
men have responded to this call.

Grout prophets, like isaioh and Jeremiah, sought to bring the
people of their day to the realization of God's love tor them.

Jesus lived and died to show that some love, and He reollled that it

would only bothrough men that the Gospel would be proclaimed to

other men.

Moreellin Chompognol, a man among u"1er men, heard that call
and took it seriously. He founded a communlty ol men—the MARIST
BROTHERS——colled by God to proclaim His love to the world.

Today the Marist Brothers are continuing to answer this call. Their
work—teaching, counseling, social work, ministering to the needs

of others—is their response to the invitation of Jesus, “Como, follow

me."

Alternate

by Diane Weintraub

Alternative health care services
for SUNYA students may be found
at the South End Community
HealthCenter, accordingto Roberta
Morrow. an Outreach Workerat the
center.

Variety Of Services

The center. at Fourth Avenue rind
Clinton Street in downtown Albany.
offers services in general ntedictne,
pediatrics. gynoeology, family plan-
ning. obstetrics and nutrition. and
speech pathology. according to
Morrow.

“A unique feature of the center is
its policy of II first-come. ﬁrst-serve,

 

 

faculty and' administration
restrooms. and groundskeepere arm-
ed with wolverines to protect the
campus. ‘

Theysuggestedthatthe University
be renamed “Fat City.”

No one gave them a chance. but
Adkins and Slyﬁeld stomped their
rivals silly in the election. Titree
times the number of usual voters
were wooed to the polls — mostly
because of the Arts and Sausage‘s
original promises and off the wall
campaign tactics. Once he was in.
presidentelect Adkins announced.
“We‘re gonna drag student govern-
ment wailing and screeching into the
streets where students can deal with
t."

of course this was all last spring.
Most cynics worth their salt would
probably claim that there crazy
characters pulled the election caper
just f oru goof. and were never intent
on following through in the fall.

But Adkins and Slyficld didn't
have time to back out. The day after
they were elected. the newly en-
franchisedduo attended a reception
for the Board of Regents. They
pressed ﬂesh and swilled ritcy liquor
while attempting to mingle with top
Texan brass.

Funds Suspended

They didn‘t cut it. The next day
the Arts and Sausages were in-
formed the Board of Regents had
voted to suspend funds for the Stu-
dent Government. “They cut our
balls off. left us standing naked. onc-
legged by it telephone booth." recalls
Slyficld.

“Put your money where our

' mouth is“ was the motto for a series

of student fundraisers called the
“Arts and Sausages Traveling Road

“Charge

more skits and so htntlis _
pitches. in fact. any wild antics' _
lived up to the campaign promise
a spectacle each morph. '

  
   
 

And apparently their gypyollh _

stints went over big, because the
and Sausages raised more mon§y
among the students than is usually, .

allocated by the Board of Regents ,_
Now that they're in the money; :~

Adkins and Slyﬁeld are trying to”.
demystify their positions, holding»;
ofﬁce hours on an ouslde mail when
they can talk to a tarp number of;
students. in addition to providing,
constant campus happenings. boozy
revels. and a humorous atmosphere.
they are serious about chaiienp’ng
the administration.
. Ask Questions

“We're gonna be pesky gnats.
stepping over the lines that the ad-
.ministration bullies have drawn."
warned Slyﬁeld.

The Arts and Sausages plan toask
embarrassing questions and ask
them loudly. Currently, the Party is
'supporting the striking booksellers
and shuttle-bus drivers who allege
that the' University‘s Wallace
bookstore engages in unfair labor
practices.

As for the traditional student
government fodder revisions
upon revisions of amendments to
constitutions. dull meetings with
faculty and administrators ~—
Adkins and Slyﬁcld aren‘t in-
lcrcstcd.

They have appointed “highly in-
telligent“ people to take care of the
mundane committee work. the
drudgery that consumes ninety per
cent of the student government‘s
time.

Health Care Offered

walk in service." Morrow said. “Ap—
pointments are trot required except
for speech pathology and hearing
care."

The center also charges on a
sliding scale according toincome. an
advantage tostudents. Morrow said.
But payment is requested on the in-
itial visit.

According to Morrow. l().(l00
patients have been treated at the
center since it opened in l972. A
professional staff includes
physicians. gynecologists. and
registered nurses. All services at the
center are handled confidentially.

vice is being offered to the public
