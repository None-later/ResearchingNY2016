DIRTY DOLL

Every neighborhood has one. but
oon you may be able to rush down
) your local store and get your very
.wn.

The latest in fad toys is. a “Dirty
)ld Man“ doll.
' Shown at the First Annual San
’rancisco 'l'oy Exposition. the doll.
.amcd “Uncle Sherman. the

Original Flasher Doll." is described
asan exhibitionist. ‘ ‘ « ‘

Uncle Sherman comes in a variety
of outﬁts. including a trenchcoat.
tuxedo. smoking jacket. terry cloth
bathrobe. or denim overalls. All of
the costumes open with ease. ex-
posing the doll‘s plastic male organ.

Uncle Sherman is the brainchild
of Allen Tegtmeir and Christine
Mole. who report that Sherman was
doing a brisk business at the toy con-
vention. Said Tegtmeier. “A lot of
people have asked for a child‘s ver-
sion“ complete with a smaller. child‘s
sized organ.

GIANT SPONGES

Giant blob-like sponges are grow-
ing at an alarming rate onthe barrels
of radioactive waste which were
dumped nearthc Farallon Islands on
the Pacific Coast.

The Oakland Tribune reports that
the monster sponges. which have not
been previously knowu to exist. are
between three to four feet tall and
shaped like vases. The creatures were
discovcrd by Robert Dyer. an
oceanographcr with the U.S. En-
vironmental Protection agency.

Reports of the dump site have
previously indicated that some ofthe
barrels had shattered and small
amounts of radioactivity had leaked
out. Dyer. however. has discounted
the idea the giant sponges may be
some kind of bizarre mutation caus-
cd by the radiation leakage.

Says Dyer: “It‘s a nice science fic-

tion idea. but I would have a hard
time justifying. it.” Dyer says the
animals probablylike the smooth
barrels in which wastes are buried.

SWEAT ITCH

A Montreal doctor is out with the
unusual findingthat most people are
allergic to their own sweat.

Doctor Ralph Wilkinson. a der-
matologist at McGill University.
says he has discovered that about 95
per cent of the population. or about
l9 in every 20 persons. suffer an

adverse reaction to their Own
perspiration.

Doctor Wilkinson reports that
this allergy is usually characterized
by an itchiness or skin irritation that
often occurs alter heavy exercise or
by going without bathing for along
period of time.

The doctor says he has no idea as
to why the bodies of most people are
allergic to their own sweat.

US WEALTH. GAP

A new study has foundthat. (stall
the industisliled nations of the
world. the United States maintains
one of the most unfair systems of dis-
tributing income. ‘

The survey conducted by British
economist Malcolm Sawyer. ranks
l2 of the wealthiest industrial
nations on the basis of the disparity
between the income of the richand
the income of the poor.

The study concludes that the Un-
ited States. along with France and
Spain. maintain economic systems
in which the gaps between the rich
and the poor are the greatest. The
statistics show that. in America. the
poorest 20 percent of the households
receive only 4.5 per cent of the in.
come. 0n the other hand. the richest
ten per cent of US. households ac-
count for 26.6 percent oftheincome.

Sawyer adds that the figures for
the US. probably underestimate the
disparity because the rich generally
under-report their incomes in
America.

ALIEN ATTACK

Several members of Congress are
reported to be seriously concerned
about the possibility that hostile
creatures on other planets may learn
that humans live on the Earth. and
that they will then come here to
destroy us.

The New York Times magazine
quotes astronomer Frank Drake as
stilling that several governmental of-
ficials in Washington have been urg-
ing scientists to turn off the radio
telescopes that send messages into
outer space.

Drake is a metnbcr ol'a small team
of scientists who hope to use the
radio telescopes. in a research study
nicknamed “l’rojecl Cyclops". to
communicate with other intellcgent
beings in the universe.

jectives to rate various wiiies.

Researcher lehrer reports she
found that the so-called experts
commonly used contradictory terms
to describe exactly the same wine.
One expert. as an example. she said,
would use the words like “sweet” and
“full-bodied” to describe the taste of
a wine. A second expert would
describe the same bottle as being
“dry” and “light.”

RINGO TOUR

Ex-bcatle Ringo Starr says that he
will probably go on tour next year.

The tour. if it happens. will be
Ringo's ﬁrst since he traveled with
the Beatles in I966. ten years ago.

Ringo says he would not want to
do a solo tour. but would prefer to
arrange a series of concerts in which
he shared the billing with two other

big name rock names. Starr says:
“They‘d each do eight or so of their
own stings and I‘d do eight of mine.
We‘d have a band backing all of us.“

If the Ringo mini-tour

bcatle. lollowing (ieorge Harrison
and Paul McCartney. to stage his
own tour. John Lennon is the only
