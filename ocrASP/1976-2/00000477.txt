,, allowing are excerpts from the
Straiglttline show on WSUA 640 AM. [lost
Dan Golnes spa/re with Central Council
Chirperson Greg lustre. ,The subject was
student Assoelotlarl. ' 

304nm.- What’s important to you about SA?
Do, you think about the training and ex-
perience for what you'll do when youyt out?
Insane: I'm always thinking of how it applies
to my- personal betterment, especially now
that I'm applying to law schools . . . my
motivation probably stemmed from boredom
of the SUNYA campus. I was just bored, and
knew that l was wastingth of my time doing
nothing. I wanted to channel my resources in
some direction.

Gaines: Is the primary interest of ad-
ministrators to help student?

'lessne: I wouldn't say primary. I'd say
healthy.

Gaines: Do you have a favorite administrator?
lessne: . . . in my dealing right now,
probably John Hartigan. In the parking lot
controversy . . . he came right out and told
me when he thought I was wrong And he did
it in a very respectful manner. He didn't deride
me. And then he went back and was saying
how last year's student leaders did not have
any respect for administrators and that they
were often,wise-mouthing administrators. He
said if he was wise-mouthed . . . he would
ask the students to ~—— and leave. I was im-
pressed by his candidness . . .

Gaines: Two crises in SA this year have been
the rewriting of Finance Policy. stimulated by
Gary Parker. and the Parker impeachment
proposal. How did SA weather the Finance
Policy crisis?

Lessnc: I think it weathered it very well. To
elaborate on how I feel about the whole inci-
dent: it comes down to Gary's basic perspec-
tive . . . it's different from everyone in-
volved right now and. as far as I can tell. peo-
ple who have been involved historically.
Gaines: Is that good?

Lessne: It‘s healthy. But a great deal of ad-

more:
jutting still remains to be done. Adjusting on
our part and adjuting on Gary's part. I view
discretion as a very important part of student
government. Gary doesn't feel that way. Gary
feels that it shouldberun likesbusiness. Hels
an accounting major, and it is obvious that he
wants to stick to rules and regulation and
adhere to them as strictly as
possible . . . discretion should be balanced
with a respect and an overriding concern for
sticking to the letter of the law. That's when
Gary helps us to know when we might be
overstepping our bounds in the use of dis-
cretion . . .
Gaines: What other projects is SA working
on?
Lessne: At the beginning of the year, I made a
promise to myself that I would not be goal
oriented. l would be acting as someone to
guide the group to goals. A facilitator.
Gaines: Who do you leave with thejob of set-
ting goals?
Lessne: Central Council. basically. but I have
been rather disappointed with that aspect of
Council this year. There is no guidance. I think
I would be happier now if Council did have a
goal and l objected to it totally. At the mo-
ment it seems it is ﬂoundering. and I'm afraid I
might have to start setting goals.
Gaines: Why are you afraid of that?
lemme: If I start setting goals for Central
Council, then I am taking upon myself the job
of representing the entire student
body . . . they (Council) should decide asa
group what goals should be addressed.
Gaines: What conclusion do you draw from
that? That student don‘t have any goals? That
they don't know what their goals should be?
tonne: Judging from the behavior of most
Council people. they are reﬂecting one at-
tribute of the general student body in a very
strong way . . . Apathy. There is noconcern
for anything. I have to impress upon the
Council many times that they are spendingthe
students‘ money. Sometimes it doesn't faze
them that they are spending thousands of
dollars an evening

racism still. rising?

To the Ethics:

I am writing in response to the ASP
editorial of Friday. Oct. 22. I976 referring
to the accusation of discriminatory practices
within the Rathskeller management. I am
forced to arrive at one basic underlying con-
clusion. Since the editorial has no author. in-
dicating a personal opinion. we can accept the
fact that this "ghost writer" reﬂects the general
consensus of the Asl’staff and alsothat of the
majority student body. with the exception of
the few ambivalents and liberals.

The editorial depicted the demonstration
staged by the Third World students as a mere
display of “emotionalism.” The attempt made
by the editorial to analyze or summarize the
intentions of the group was not only an un-
sophisticated and undemocratic approach.
but also a poor excuse for ignoring the cir-
cumstances which could give validity to the
"racism" charge. which gave rise to the collec~
tive efforts of the Third World st udents' reac-
tion.

However twisted the editorial may have
been. it sucocedcd in recognizing one realistic
goal of any group. in this case. the students in-
volved. The “good. emotional. gut issue“ as
hc/shc/thcy (the author) described it. does
foster unity. but this was not. and will not be in
the future. their only“chancc tofch together“
because they are together.

Needless to say. that demonstration mcant
serious business. To underestimate the collec-
tive and concerted efforts ofu unified body of
otherwise satisfied people. we face it
dangerous sign of the times. lfwc arc to bcthc
future educators. philosophers. sociologists
and administrators. wc havethe responsibility
to respect and not make light of such
situations as the Ruthskellcr incident. One
thing which is not predictable because it is not
voiced by those involved. is to what extent the
cxtcrnulitics inﬂuence the intcrnulitics. lfpeo-
plc continue to bc dcnicdthcir rights. well. . .

who knows what the outcome will be. Accor-
ding to Langston Hughes, a famous black
writer/uuthor/poct. a “dream deferred" can
sometimes cxplodc.
Judith A. Bevillc

. . . and rising?

To the Editor:

“It's no secret: simplifying an issue is
quicker and cusicr than going to it” the trouble
of deciding what is rcully at stake.“ If this
sounds familiar. it should: it opens the
[Editorial in last Friday‘s ASI’. This cditoriul
dcnlt with u student protest against rncism in
this University. In the piece. the editor
attempts to discrcdit the tuctics of confronta-
tion and demonstration. claiming that they
simplify and emotionalircd issues. This.
however. is exactly what the editorial did to
the issue of racism inthc Rut. and the Univer-
sity as it whole.

We have to object to the simplification of
the Issue of racism to it matter of bulletin
boards. Various manifestations of racism
within the Uuivcrsitywcre brought out by the
students present; the ASP chose tolimit their
reporting to one particular charge: that of
selective removal of posters (the criteria being
the Rat management‘s agreement or disagree-
ment with the views of the poster's
originators). While this issue is not trivial. it
hardly comprises the sum total of racist th-

 

 

r .

 

tivities on this campus. Other issues wemdup
with such as the virtual defacrosegrewinof
minority students into “their own” syngm
(BOP). and the decimation of ethnic some.
programs by the hand of Fields. In light of
this. it is surely a redurrlo al absurdumto on.
fine discussion of prejudice to the nvailah-Iity
of poster space, and even more farcical [dimp-
ly. as does the editor, that the installation on
few bulletin boards will “close the case‘qu
cerning the practice of racism ut SUNYA.
The editor criticizes last Thursdsy's
demonstrators for “bringing ou. the
bullhorn.” It‘s a shame that the ASP, whose
circulation gives it the loudest “bullhom on
campus. seems always tosquundcr its Voiq on
petty peevishness. while ignoringthe real: ens
of student concern.

Capitalists into joining the YSA? As a sup-
porter of the protest. what would Name
Withheld's slogan have been?

Perhaps he/she objects to the fact that we
labelled our signs “SUNYA YSA". What else
should we have labeled them? Maybe he/she
just‘objccts. though. to us admitting who we
are (he/she does not admit who he/ she is after
all). Saying who you are and what you stand
for is “political advertisement"—the fact that
it happens to be honest is irrelevent.

Later on in the letter. Name Withheld does
admit the sense in labeling yourself at
demonstrations. but the YSA supposedly did
it in an “extreme” way. By whose standards?

' We did not know about any standards of ex-

tremity before the demonstration. otherwise
we would have been glad to respect them if
they were decided. democratically. by majori-
ty vote. like the call for the demonstration
itself.

Finally. we are accused of selling our press
“the Militant" in the campus center. Earlier in
the letter, Name Withheld accuses us of not
making our political positions known. and
then he/she objects to us selling our press.
which is the best way we have of making our
political positions known! We are accused of
"accosting" people. But who draws the line of
distinction between uccosling and selling? We
have a solicitation permit. we don‘t touch or
grab people in any way. we don't shoutat peo-
ple or obstruct thoroughfarcwin fact. we
make a point of no! getting in anybody‘s way.
Doesn‘t our “democratic capitalist“ respect
the right of n free prcss'.’ Particularly for small
organizations that have limited means of
reaching pcoplc.

refusal reply

To the Editor:

We are writing in response to Lois A.
Goldstein's letter which appeared in the
Oct. 26 issue of the Albany Student Press
concerning Circle K.

As Ms. (ioldstcin pointed out. our
membership is quitc small. mostly due to luck
of publicity. The main reason for this lack of
publicity is that wc urc onc ofthc iicwcstclubs
ut SUNYA. and we needed :1 solid nucleus of
members before we could launch any major
publicity drive. We now fch tan we have that
nucleus. and are in the process of organizing
our publicity drive. so we will not take this op-
portunity to cxpund on what Ms. Goldstcin
said concerning wlutt Circle K is all about.

First off. Circle K is an international
orgunilation whose primary purpose is com-
munity service. This means that we are gctting
involved in numerous types of volunteer work.
both on campus and in the surrounding com-
munity. l'rcscntly. our club is working with
emotionally. mentally. and physicully linu-
dicnppcd youngsters through the Eleanor
Roosevelt I)cvclopmcntu| Center. We also
linvc plans ol'sturtiugun udopt-n-grnndpnrcnt
program 'it the 'I‘urisinn II ousc and to help out
with the Class of 79's Carnival for 'l‘clctbon.

C.rclc K is the largest collcgiutc organizav
tion in North America with over 800 clubs
throughout the Unich States. Canada. and
the Caribbean. ()ur international theme for
I976—7B is Mlllt't‘ rm Impact on Life. Circle K
clubs have been working to accomplish this
through major emphasis progrums: Action for
the Youth and Elderly. Action for Public
Health. Action to Allcviutc Ilungcr. Action
for Consumer Protection. and Action for
Social Priorities. Although we Work primarily
with these five vitul concerns. we are not
limited to them.

Finally. a word of interest to those of you
who were involved with Key Club back in high
school. Circle K is part of that so-cnlled Tri-K
Family you heard so much about: Kiwanis.
Circle K. und Key Club. Our club. in pur-

ticular. is working very closely with the
Colonic-Albany Kiwanis Club and the
Colonic H.S. Key Club.

If you are interested in helping us make an
impact on life or would like to find out more.

I just come to one of our meetings. held the first

and third Wednesdays of each month at
nice pm. in LC-22.

To the Editor:

In I969. 17-year-old Marina Tiemkin’s
father. a well-known physicist. applied for an
exit visa to emigrate to Israel. The Soviet
Government. after very little consideration. de'
tried his request. Mr. Tiemkin, as a result. be-
came one of the growing numberinthc ranks
of those Soviet Jews who were refused emigra-
tion to Israel because they were. as the state
claimed. 'security risks‘. Three years later. Mr.
Tiemkin was granted an exit visa for himself
and his daughter. Marina. to leave for Israel.
Upon arriving at the emigration office to pick
up their visas. he found only one. The visa for
Marine was not issued because Mr. Tiemkin
was separated from his wifc. It wasjudged by
the Soviet authorities that this separation
made him an unfit father. Thc state further
declared that Marina would be placed under
its custody because her mot her was a working
woman who. in their opinion. would not have
the time to give the proper attention and
guidance necessary in rnising a growing.
teenage girl. Marina was thcnscpuratcd from
both of her parents and sent toa‘youthcenter'
iti Siberia. Upon arriving at the ‘youth center'
(concentration camp—w hat else can youcall a
place enclosed with barbed wire fences and
guards carrying guns'l). Marina expressed
strong desire and dcterminationto be reunited
with her dear father and mother. This was
deemed impossible by the Soviet authorities
who f on her surprcsscd her strong emotional
feelings. Hcr continued appeals went unhccd-
cd llnd resulted in dragging and sedation.

This is one of the most commonly used
methods to suppress the ycarning for freedom.
It is a tragedy which affects all. for her case is a
classic example of the brutality of the Soviet
regime. It is a further tragedy when a 17-year-
old girl is denied the most basic of human
requests v-to be reunited with her mother and
father. Don‘t let this case go unanswered. for
we. us human beings. must fulfill our
obligations as members of our free society to
help other human beings in trouble. Join us in
our appeal to free Marina Tiemkin and other
free-minded individuals in the Soviet Union
who wish to emigrate. Our prescription for
Murinu's l'rccdom is not an easy one. for we
know her release is now very unlikely. What
we must do. as individuals. is at least make an
attempt. For if we don't. the freedom that we
prirc so highly for ourselves is worthless. It is
cuch person's obligation. individually. to let
Murinu know that someone cures. is concern-
cd. and wants so desperately to help.

Dean for Student Affairs Neil Brown ordered formerC H
President Marc Benecke to return $3,000 to the Class [afterl'i i'
guilty of stealing that amount from the Class lastyear. '
In addition, Benecke has been suspended fromschool for ISI '
During this time he must pay back the $3,000 or his actide'inic
SUNYA will be permanently curtailed. v " '

 
 

  

Granted. in an educational environment a high tolerance of mistakes: '
is appropriate. However. if Benecke had a calculated criminal scheme '
for extracting monies from the pockets of his fellow students; then is j

actions were hardly a mistake. Then the onlylmistake be made was

taking too much too fast from one place without covering his‘tracks. 1’
If Benecke's actions were criminal, punishment should not stop at .

Brown’s office. Built into this country's political structure there are laws
to deal with crime. The purpose of these laws is to provide punishment;
the purpose of punishment is to prevent other crimes.

Driving a car on Perimeter Road faster than 30 miles per hour is a
crime. As such, it is dealt with in a court of law. The theft of $3,000 is also
a crime. It too should be dealt with in a court of law. ‘

Brown has chosen a punishment for Benecke. Yet many modern
remain incensed about the matter, contending that he is getting off too
easy. Such sentiments are understandable. If Benecke had riﬂed a cash
register at Macy’s outside the protective walls of SUNYA, he might end
up at Levenworth making license plates.

Brown stated that the punitive action does not preclude any further
legal proceedings against Benecke. However, the responsibility for
pursuing such proceedings now lies with the students.

Students should work. perhaps through the Student Association
which supposedly represents them. to ensure that Benecke's case is heard
in a court of law. Brown‘s actions have implied Benccke‘s guilt —- not
proven it in the public eye. A punishment has been handed down —— but
only the courts have the power to weigh the merits of Beneckc’s case and
come to an equitable settlement.
