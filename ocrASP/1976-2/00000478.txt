playing a series of macho games in order to in-

The fact that Parker was wrong in the first
place—that the PCA did have
authorization—almost seems to be lost in the
shuffle. Not only did he ref useto recognize the
truth which was told to him by Browne-
Marke. Parker attemptedto impreSs Browne-
Marke by posing as‘somc sort of law ofﬁcial.
At this point. he travelled from a demonstra-
tion of his contempt to actually breaking the
law.

But now Parker has been “pardoned.” I'm
sure he‘ll promise nevertodoit again. And the
ASP rejoices that we can all go back tothc im-
portant business at hand. Meanwhile. an im-
portant precedent has been set: the SA Vice
President can harass students. lie about his
identity. and "confiscate" (some might read
that as steal) anything which was rightfully
borrowed.

But. it doesn't have to end here. Since SA
can‘t expose the filth in our government we

NOVEMBER 3, 1976

 

By DAVE WINZELBERG
And MATT KAUFMAN

it’s I965 and the Byrds are flying
high on the charts with their hit
single “Mr. Tambourine Man".
Eleven years later. The Byrds are a
memory. but their spirit is alive and
incarnate in original group founder
Roger McGuinn and his new group.
Thunderbyrd.

On Friday night. Thitnderhyrd
blasted their way into Page Hall.
soaring high with good old classic
rock and roll.

“Well. the name is n composit.“
McGuinn explains. “The liyrd part
is naturally form The liyrds. and the
Thunder is from Bob Dylan's Roll-
ing Thunder Review which I was a
part of."

Although the concert was part of
the promotional effort for
McGuinn's new album. ('urt/il'l'
Ruse, 'l'hunderbyrd concentrated on
McGuinn‘s earlier material. The
show opened with it hard driving.
rock-out rendition of thc Byrd's hit.
“Lover of the linyou". receiving a
standing ovation from the hull-full
audience of four hundred fans.

McGuinn. who has changed
hands many times. had not hitigto do
with the formation of his newest
band. He said he is very happy with
the current line-up after just ii few
months of rehearsals and perfor-
munces. He is even thinking mm

“Hurray for theater!“ cried B/rmd

“Hurray for audiences!“

‘l he impci us for this outburst was

formal l.ittlc 'l'hcutcr last Friday
night. But perhaps the man spoke of
his success too soon: director
Richard Jones should have waited
till the cud of the performance to

in quite well with Thunderbyrd's
music. on both the old and new
tunes.

“Here‘s a couple of old Byrd's
songs. just for fun." McGuinn
proudly proclaimed curly into the
set.

“ ‘Tifl'ttny Qucen‘. " calls a voice in
the audience.

"OK". Suddenly McGuinn began
to search for the chords. starting to
pluythc song. Smith stares at Barlow
and Mc(ittinn. He looks bewildered
and perplexed.

made by an obviously dedicated
troupe of players. This version was
somewhat simpliﬁed and decidedly
amateurish. No attempt was madcto
fully explore the complexities of the
characters: the sets and special
effects were reduced to the httre
minimum.

I The mother of the bridegroom.
played by Leslie Levine. was un-
doubtedly the most outstanding of
the east. Her pcrfortrtancc was such a
violent and Spitfire one. that i
suspect she was solelytryingto make
up for the rest ofthc cust‘s blandness.

successfully captured the bitterness

Some that i never even heard before. i

and i find myself saying. ‘Roger.
what key are we in"? He did that to

me tonight." Smith conﬁded after '

the performance in the warm con-
fines of a small. crowded dressing
room. .

Thunderbyrd was called out for
two cncores, closing the show with
“So You Want to be a Rock and Roll
Star". leaving the audience scream-
ing for an extended flight.

A fitting ending for this veteran
rock and roller. who later explained
“l‘m just trying to make a living."

band and two sons. It is her haun-

No one else came close to the
mother‘s seething performance,
though Steve Goodman‘s portrayal
of Leonardo. the fierce lover. was a
strong one. He carried an under-
current of rage appropriate to the
role. Kathleen Murstct’s lIS the
runaway bride. Richard Murstcrs as
the dutiful bridegroom. and Linda
Turco its Leonardo‘s much-
wrongcd. very pregnant wife all
played their roles adequately.

ing lhc course of the play. It con-
sisted of a bare. stark.

was disappointing to miss the

Leonardo and the bride profess their

reminded rather rudely of the

So. “Hurray for theater." as the
