The Danes were knocking on the

ed momentum if they could punch
this one on . . But this was not to
be as the Danes were penalized ﬁf-
teen yards for holding on ﬁrst down.‘
and ﬁfteen more for a personal foul
on second down. The result was that
Albany wound up punting the'ball
away from the Lions Sit and another
great chance to take the lead had
been wasted.

Despite those two blown chances.
Albany dominated first half play.
rushing for 234 yards while holding
the high-powered Lions' attack to a
total offense of l3l yards . .

The second half. however. was to
be a completely different story. In
fact. the difference between the two
halves was so great that one might
have thought it was We different
teams competing.

Albany coughed up the ball four
times through fumbles and did not
get a first down until the ﬁnal three
minutes of the game.

Meanwhile. it

seemed th’ati';:v "

Albright had solved the riddle of the. ' '

Dancs' defense. On their second
possession of .the half. Sharp put
together another long drive: this'
time covering 80 yards in ten plays.

The big plays included ar22-yard run '

on a third and one by Sharp. and the
quarterback's pass to tight end Dan
Delehany for 28 yards on a thirdand
three. Frankie Franks ﬁnally ramm-
ed it in from the four. and with the}
extra point. Albright led I4-7. '
Albright closed oat the scoring.
with two more scores in the fourth
quarter. Sharp engineered another
long scoring series. this one covering
69 yards with Franks scooting the
last I3 yards up the middlefor the
score. The Lions' last pointswere
scored as a result of a fumble

recovery on the Danes‘ eight-yard '

line. Sharp then hit fullback Jim

Fulginiti with an eight-yard scoring '

toss. With 2:2l-to go. the game was
just about over. I

Looking back. Ford uttributesthe.
lossloafew factors. . .'l'beinability
to put up those early scores. the fact
that the defense was forced to play'so
much in the second half. and the fact
that the ol'l‘cns‘c was not able to move
the ball. “But you can not leave out
the fact that Albright isa damn good
football team." Ford said. "They
make you beat them. they don't beat ‘
themselves.“ _

After the game. one player from
each squad was voted the MVP for
this Shrine-Pretzel bowl game. Fred
Brewington won the honors for
State and Pat Sharp did likewise for
the Lions. Iircwington led all rushct‘s
with 87 yards while Sharp led the
Albright attack with 7‘) on the
ground and 85 more throuin the air.

The Danes. 3-4 on the year. have
lost more games this year then the
sum total of all their games lost since
becoming a varsity club back in
I974. They face the possibility of
their first losing season with
Plattsburgh State and Springfield
College still to go.

Next week the Danes will travel to
i’lottsburgh to try and get things
straightened out before coming
home for the season ﬁnale against
Ford‘s alma mater. Springfield
College.
