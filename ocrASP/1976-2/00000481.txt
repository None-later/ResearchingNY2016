Harriers 7th in Tourney

by Rich Sellgson

For the usually talkative and'

good-spirited Albany varsity cross
country coach. Robert Munsey.
there wasn't too much to talk or
smile about. His squad hadjust add-
ed another disappointment to their
long list this season. ﬁnishing in
seventh place in the l0th Annual
Albany Invitational on Satur-
day. .

The meet was well organized;
there was a large crowd (about
l.200). ﬁne schools. and near-perfect
weather in the low 50's. iiut ttone of
these factors helped the Dane
harricrs on the 5.05 mile course. The
last two years of the invitational
have been disgraceful times for
Albany. They have shown not lting as
a team in their own meet. and this is
very upsetting to Munsey. “It‘s the
second year in a row we looked
lousy. I‘d like to know the reasons
why. but i don't know.“

Keene State College. N.ll.. won
the team title. to no one's surprise.
with runners placing first. third.
tenth. seventeenth. and nineteenth
for a 50-point total. The individual
title went to Kurt Schull. who left
i37 other barriers trailing. The
scnior's time was 24:55—40 seconds
better than his fifth place perfor-
mance in last year's meet. Schulz ran
the sixth best time ever on Albany's
course.

Another senior. Bill Strain of
Millersvillc. came in second place in

25: [8. He also competed in last fall‘s
invitational. that time cortting in
twelfth place. University of
Massachusetts (oi points) was sc-
cond behind chne State inthcteam
competition. with Millersville (90).
Marist (l04). Sicna (lilil). and
Plattsburgh (189). rounding out the
ﬁrst six squads.
And then came the “Not-So-
Grcat-Dancs.“ Only last week. they
shad beaten Siena quite handily.
Saturday‘s meet marked tltc first
time a Sicna squad has ever ﬁnished
ahead of an Albany harricr team.
One major reason for the Danes’
poor showing was the inability of
their best rttnncr. Chris llurns. to be
among. or at least near the top is.
liurns‘ time was Zozlo. good for
only twenty-second place. “is run-
ning has been below par of late. and
Munsey again couldn‘t find an
answer. "I don't know; Chris is not
running like the runner he has been.
and is. i don‘t know what the answer
is." Too many questions and not
enough answers; this ltas been the
major problem of Albany‘s season.
especially at this meet.
liut it wasn‘t all that bad. There
were a few bright spots inthis dismal
Dane afternoon. The running of Bill
“Bruno” Mathis. as he is called by his
teammates, was “one of the pleasant
things that happened on this day."
accordingto Munsey. The freshman.
who moved up to varsity in the early
continued on page ﬁfteen

ing flurry.

Carlos Arango tallied number six ‘
for the Danes. at l7:00. with help
from Denora. One-half minute later
Brian Van Hatter. a DB center line
player. found the net. seconded by
Louic Azcuc. It was U B's last goal of
the day. as Dane netminder Alberto
Giordano saved all the UB shots
ﬁred at him from then on.

The Dane offense kept pounding
away at Gleason. and added two
more scores before time ran out. The
seventh Albany goal was the pret-
ticsl of them all. Sclca broke away
from the field with some impressive
dribbling attd had Gleason. the
goalkeeper. one on one. instead of
shooting. Selca faked his shot and
passed the ball perfectly to Rolando.
who was waiting and poked it into
the unguarded left side of the net.

After the game. Dane Coach ilill
Schicffclin commented. “The play
with Frank and Johnny was the most
impressive play ofthe day. it showed
teamwork. it was completely un-
selfish."

Jorge Aguilar added the final
point. a Dane tally. on a penalty kick

Coach Schieffclitt felt the reason
for the Dane victory Wits "blending."

The Danes outshot Uli 26 to 10.
“Our offense totally dominated.“
said Schicffelin.

On Saturday. the Danes host

The game might also serve as the
lirockport instead of Albany.

Whether or not the game is the
championship game depends on the

outcome of Wednesday‘s meeting
between Onconta and Cortland.
Only if Onconta beats Cortland and
scores two or less goals will the

championship game. Any other out-

the Albright College Lions rallied
for 2! sccond half points to sendthc
Danes to their fourth defeat of the
year. 28-7 Saturday. at Reading.

The Danes. despite wasting two
golden scoring opportunities. had
played the sixth’ranked (N.Y.S.

played in two halves and the Danes
failed to realize this as Albright

the game.

line. Three plays brought up a fourth
and two from the two and the Danes

Former Class of ’78 President
Marc Bcnccke is appealing his l5-
month suspension from SUNYA
ordered by Dean of Student Affairs
Neil Brown last Friday.

Beneckc referred himself to the
SUNYA judicial system on Oct. 7
dttring an investigation concerning
Class of ‘78 debts. Class Council
members reported that Bencckc ad-
mitted stealing $3.000 in Class
monies. Subsequently he was
suspended front school and signed
an agreemcttt with the Class of‘7lito
repay the stolen money at a rate of
$200 per month.

The Student Affairs Council of

Benecke To Appeal Suspension

the University Senate will decide to-
day whether to accept the appeal.

According to Brown if it chooses
to hear the appeal. the Student Af-
fairs Council can sustain the present
decision. lessen the penalty ordered
by Brown. or levy a harsher sentence
against the former Class president.

If the Council does accept the
appeal. some involved parties expect
that one of the University vice
presidents will act as a hearing of-
ficer and preside over the judicial
proceedings.

llcncckc refused comment. stating
only that he felt an appeal was in
order. Also refusing comment was
Brown. who explaincdthat while the

case was still in the SUNYA judicial
process. anything he might say could
improperly inﬂuence the Council‘s
decision.

Tim Burton. who has succeeded
llenecke as Class president. said. “I
didn‘t think Benecke would do it. I
don‘t think anything will bechanged
. . . I thought it [Brown‘s decision]
was a fair ruling."

Prefer SUNYA

Brown also refused comment on
possible legal action against

AMIA Disobeys Court Ruling

by Mike l’lekarski

SA Supreme Court Chief Justice
Vicki Kurtzman issued a writ Tues-
day terminating AMlA‘s suspension
of student Andrew Ellncr. AMIA
had disobcycda court ruling the
previous Thursday calling for the
restoration of Ellncr‘s right to par~
ticipatc itt intramural sports.

Ellncr was suspended by AMIA
after admitting that the basketball
team he played for had used ineligi-
blc players. Wltcn Ellncr failed to
comply with AMlA‘s ruling. lie was
dealt a second suspension. effective
for a one-year period. for
“disobedience of a previous suspen-
sion."

On October 28. the supreme court
ruled that Ellncr's ﬁrst and second

Psychology Grad Director Quits

by Edward Rader

Clnitning that he does not “have
any confidettcc from anyone“. Dr.
William Simmons resigned last Week
as the director of the Graduate
Program in Clinical Psychology.
The program involves about forty
graduate students.

The immediate cause of his
resignation was the refusal by Dean
Richard Kendall. of the Division of
Social and Behavioral Sciences. to
recommend Simmon‘s request fora
sabbatical durittg the upcoming spr-
ing term. Simmons said he feels that
tltc denial showed a lack ofsupport
for him. “Damn it. you don't deny a
senior professor a sabbatical unless
you‘re trying to tell him something."
he said.

Request Required

SUNYA policy requires that
professors seeking sabbaticals sub-
mit a written request outlining how
their titnc spent away front the
school will benefit the university.
"The important point is t hat they are
leaves with pay." Kendall said.
“They are ttot automatically given.“
Simmons would have received lull
pay for his one ternt leave.

ill his letter of request. Simmons
wrote. "i propose to spend my sair
haticul becoming familiar with the
area of mental health administra-
tion. particularly as it applies to psy-
chologists and tltercby become a
resource person on the topic. one
who could offer a new dimension to
the clinical training program . . . i

would be able to write and teach in
the area. supervise discrtations and
other research activities. and in
general be a consultant available to
students. colleagues. etc."

Dr. Richard Gallup. chairman of
the Psychology department. sup
ported Simmons‘ request. writing in
an accompanying letter. “a graduate
course on the topic would improve
the quality and focus of our clinical
training.“ Comntenting on Sim-
mons' assertion that he had received
only minimal support from the
chairman. Gallup said. “Did I feel
strongly enough to resign over it'.’
No."

Denies Request

Witch asked what his reasons were
for dcnyittg tltc request. Kendall
replied. “i am not at liberty to make
public the substance of personal
matters that affect faculty. Faculty
can do so if they want.“

Kendall said in his letter refusing
Sintmons' sabbatical. "As i read
your proposal. the essential point
appears to be the preparation of a
course of study . . . The prevailing
assumption is that a new course falls
within the range of customary
professorial activities. and tttay ill-
cludc the use of stttttttter months.
The activity is obviously one of
merit. but it cttn he and is accounted
for in ways other that sabbatical
leave."

Simmons feels that tile refusal was
symptomatic of the lack of support
the clinical psychology program itas

received in general. He cites as an ex-
ample his attempt to have tltc
program accredited bythe American
Psychological Association last spr-
ing. Hc applied to the Association
for accreditation and then asked that
the University write a formal letter to
the APA asking them to come to the
school and review the program. He
says that the administration was
"upset" by his action and that it lead
to meetings bethcn Gallup. Ken-
dall. and acting Vice President for
academic affairs David Martin.
Claiming that he was excluded from
the meetings Simntons said. "They
were discussing my program. and
they never asked me
[anything]."

(iallup refutes Simmons' claim of
non-support. “The result of that
ntccting was a decision to postpone
tltc writing of an invittttiott to the
AI’A until this fall." (inllup said.
“What we hoped to do in the in-
terim". he said. “was to hire another
professor for the program. tltcrcby
incrcttsittg our chances for accredita-
tion." Since l970. when Simmons
took the position ofdircctor. no one
above the level of assistant professor
has been ltircd for tltc dcpartntcttt
and Simmons considers this anotitcr
ittdictttion of a low level ofsupport.

“The clinical psych program has
received more focused support tiutn

ment“. (iallupsnid. ile cited reduced

suspensions were unmeritcd and that
“Ellncr is reinstated as a potential
participant in all AMIA sponsored
activities.“

In a letter addressed to Ellner
dated Ociovcr 29. it was stated that
the AMIA Council would establish a
committee to review the Supreme
Court decision of the previous day
and Would appeal the decision to the
Student Affairs Council. The letter
then states: “At least until such

proceedings are cotnpletcd. Andy '

Ellncr‘s suspension from all AMIA
activities shall continue." The letter
is signed by Michael Curwin. Presi-
dent of AMIA.

“I don‘t think tltcy can do this."
said Ellncr. “I don‘t think they can
suspend me again."

"The motion was clearly no-
constitutional." said AMIA Council
member Nolan Altman. SA Presi-
dent Steve DiMeo yesterday rc-
qucsted that AMIA lift the suspen-
sion. When asked why he waited
more than six days to take action.
DiMco replied that he was hoping
that the appeal would go through
soon. and the whole matter would
just blow over.

“The first suspension 1 got was for
being captain of the team." Ellncr
said. "i argued that i wasn‘t captain.
I also argued that l was never ad-
vised of a trial where my case was
concerned."

In the fall of I975. the intramural
basketball team. “The Silver
Streak". was folding because oflack
of participation and was onthc verge
of forfeiting out of the league. Ellncr
spoke to Dennis Elkin. Intramural
Athletics and Recreational Coor-
dinator. on behalf of two remaining
members of the learn. to request per-
mission to sign up new players“—
cvcn thonglt the deadline for this had
already passed. Ellncr also made his
request before the AMlA Council.
Approval was granted and three
more players signed the roster.

Wiilt the new members. the team
reached the playoffs before beingac—
cuscd of using illegal players. Ellncr
was iltett apparently held responsible
for that by tlte AMIA and suspend-
cd. Randy Egilltctyk. an AMIA
representative. claims ltc informed
llener of the suspension. Ellncr
denies this.

"I found ottt about the first
suspension from my roommate."
lillncr said. “liut l hadn‘t heard of
any formal decision."

Ellncr tltctt claitns that he played

in a softball game and had one at bat.
Later. Ellncr claimed that he "heard"
that the Council was suspending
him.

“I went up to the AMIA office of
what I thought was my own free
will.“ said Ellncr. “and all of a
sudden I was on trial. They asked me
to leave the room hccuasc they were
going to vote on me. Then they told
me I was suspended for an additional
year because of not obeyingthc ﬁrst
suspension. But i was never officially
notified of the first suspension."

Ellncr then appealed to SA
supreme court. AMIA claimed that
Ellncr was the captain of the team
and that the captain of any team is
responsible for the use of ineligible
players. Ellncr claimed that he was
not the captain. The court ruled that
evidence was found to prove that
Ellncr was the captain: his name was
not at the bottom ofthe roster sheet
and no other documents proved itto
be so.

The bottom portion of the roster
sheet which captains are required to
sign states “The use of an inelegible
player may result in the loss and
fortciturc of all games in which he
participates.“

Members of Ellner's defense
claimed that the AMIA dcrivedtheir
power to suspend the captain from
their own “minutes.” The court ruled
that the AMIA had no right to sus-
pend a member of a team “for
something they cannot justly sus-
pend a captain for."

The court also ruled that AMIA is
negligent is governing itself without
written regulations. They further
ruled that the writittg of such rules
should be completed immediately.
