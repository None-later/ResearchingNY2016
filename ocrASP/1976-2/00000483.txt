In the study, conducted at Vale of

Loch Lomondside. the researchers

The Low control cases were drawn

The researcher concluded that
there is strong evidence that the
treatment increased survival time
“by a factor of about 3 for most”
patients in the experiment.

They added. “It is our opinion that
a similar effect would be found on

. untreatable cancer patients in other

countries."

The researchers said I6 per cent of
the vitaminC patients survived for
more than a year, and those treated
generally felt better.

Grade Posting  .to’  r '

In Violation of  Act

SUC at Cortland Vice President
for Student Affairs William Taylor
announced to his division deans last
week that public posting of student
grudcs violates the rights and privacy
act of I974.

According to Taylor, the State
University Council reviewed all the
latest changes in the Manily
Educational Rights and Privacy Act
of 1974. “The itlw docs prohibit the
posting of grades by any name or
number or final average by an in-
structor even though the student's
identification may be assigned by
either a social security number or
identification number or numbers or
letters randomly selected."

“Recently a test case came before
the Department of Health. Educa-
tion and Welfare (HEW) in
Washington. D.C.," said Taylor.
“and a student whose grade was
posted by his social security nlgnbcr
filed suit against the instructor for
violating his privacy and the student
won the case."

The vice president went onto add.
“They‘ve defined 'Dircctory Infor-

 

Iizlimr’x NUIt'.’ This .rrury originally
appeared in I/tc C orllaml Press.

however. has the right to deny the
publication of this information as

do this. by the way." said Taylor.

Copies of the act are printed in a
supplement to the college catalog.
“A blue pamphlet explains, as simp-
ly as possible. each section of the
Act,"'statcd Taylor.

Small [coture classes will not be
grcutly affected by the prohibition,
however Iargc lccturc classes “will
present a lot of problems for the in-
structor." Taylor went on to add, “I
think it is a perfectly ridiculous
policy and it httndicupsthc collcgcin

students."

The Dean of Arts and Sciences
Kendall Reynolds agreed with the

ridiculousness and stated. "as a divi-‘

sion, nothing is being done. It will be
done individually by each class. The
Psychology Department.“ he added,
“did ask if waivers could be posted.

Confusing Catalog Causes Suit

(CPS) Students suing their colleges
and running off with a quick for-
tunc'.’ Naahh. that's only in
storybooks. students never win those
battles.

But sometimes they do. In an
Oregon District Court last month.
I’ctcr Dizick was awarded a $|2.500
scttlcment in his suit against Ump—
qua Community College (UCC). a
small, technically oriented school in
Roseburg, Oregon. Dizick charged
UCC with misrepresentation in its

annual course catalog.

“I wasted a year of my life."
rccountcd Dizick to the six person
jury. Dizick complained that a
welding course he took in I974
promised the use of machinery that
the school didn't even own. The: stu-
dent asscrtcd he would not have
registered for the course had he not
been misled by the catalog.

Higner Stakes In Mind

Dizick. in his mid-thirties.
orginally had higher stakes in mind;

550.000 for punitive damages and
$25,000 for general damages.

Ofﬁcials at UCC were more thana
tad surprised by the adverse deci-
sion. "It was acase wetooktoolight-
ly." explained I.S. Hakenson. presi-
dent of UCC.

Sting School “Ridiculous”

A student council member said the
school‘s attorney didn‘t present the
cast: correctly. and added “it was
pretty ridiculous for Dizick to sue
the school anyway.“
