CAFFEINE FREAKSV

A Los Angeles nutritionist. is war-
ning that many American children
have unwittineg become caffeine
freaks.

Mary Louise Bunker of UCLA‘s
Nutrition Department says that
millions of children are receiving
massive doses ofcafl'eine in their soft
drinks and candy bars. and that
many parents are unaware of this.

According to Bunker. the caffeine
content of most cola drinks has been
steadily increasing over the past
decade so that today‘s typical cola
contains half the caffeine found in at
strong cup of coffee. She adds that

 

 

mtlny candy bars contain almost its
much.

Excessive caffeine. Blinker \vttrus.
Cllll lead to hyperactivity and other
tltlmeiits.

The animal behavior records in-

restless than usual. They spent more
time on the ground than high on
their climbing structures and nesting

HOT SPOTS

Government officials. who have
proposed storing nuclear wastes in
salt mines hundreds ofmiles beneath
the earth. have suggested marking
the atomic burial sites with
pyramids.

The pyramids would be posted
with signs warning etlrthlings
thousands of years from now not to
accidentally stumble on the hot
spots.

One Harvard University scientistI
however. has cast it cynical eye on
this idea: Professor George
Kistiakowsky told the energy
research and development ad-
ministration that thousands of years
from now. "The English language
probably would disappear" and an
ice age “would smash till
monuments."
