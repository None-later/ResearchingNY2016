Looking for Leonardo

FLORENCE. Italy (AP) Travers
Newton has been spending his days
rapping on a wall with his bare list.
but he is confident ltis sore knuckles
and some sophisticated sonar equip-
ment will eventually lo'atc a lost
masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci.
Newton is part of an American
tcant which launched the search last
month in the great council hall ofthe
Florence municipal pulacc.
Members of t he team have already
discovered that there is a brick wall
behind a fresco by Giorgio Vasari.
and they believe the wall was put up
by the Ililh century paintcr out of
respect for a fellow artist whose work
hc darctl not destroy. A small in-
scription in Vasari‘s painting
"(‘ct‘ca. lrova" or scck and you “1”
find is a piece ot “Renaissance
humor" that helps convince them
they arc looking III t hc right spot for
Leonardo's "llattlc of Angiari."
