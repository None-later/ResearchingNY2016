In the short life of Alexander the
Great noble and ignoble acts are
i her evenly matched. Among the
alter we must include his burning of
he royal Persian palace at
Persepolis. This occttrred in the spr-

'A.D.. tells us that Alexander acted
against the express advice of

general. Alexander desired to punish
the Persians. so Arrian‘s account
continues. for the destruction which
they had inflicted upon (ireeee at the
time of the Persian Wars i5il years

himself to criticize Alexander. he

There is. however. a rival and

Alexander took part iii a merry
drinking botit with sortie of his
generals and their women. Among
the latter was I'hais. who was an
Athenian woman atid tltc mistress of
Alexander's general Ptolemy. As the
drinking progressed I'liais urged
Alexander to burn tltc hours of

is immaterial. The
palace featured much cedarwood
construction. once the fire had been
set it would have been impossible to
stop it. and the destruction was quite
thorough.

As for Thais. she eventually went
to Egypt \vitli Ptolemy and bore him
three children. But Dante. in his
Divine Collin/i; assigns her to hell.
I‘herc. perhaps. Alexander was
waiting lor her.
