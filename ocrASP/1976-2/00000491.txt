To the Editor:

I am writing in response to the article
written by Corrine Bernstein on counseling
services at SUNYA. While We are rippreciative
of the article. we hope to give you a broader
view of the services available at Middle Earth.

We wish to point out that Middle Earth
is made up of two components:
Telephone Switchboard (457-5300) rind ln-
dividual Counseling. We are located on Dutch
Quad. Schuyler Hall. Room l02. Counselor-
operators answer the phones Monday thru
Thursday from 9:00 am. to l2 midnight and
weekends 24 hours a day. People should feel
free to call orto drop in at any ofthese times to
discuss anythingthat is on their minds (such as
hassles with roommates. boyfriends.
girlfriends.schoolwork. birth control. drug in.
formation. etc.). We even offer coffee and tea
when we have it!

Middle Earth can schedule counseling
sessions with graduate students who have had
significant counseling training and experience
within 24 hours. We feel that sometimes this
immediate responsiveness is it necessity and
very important to the person in need.

Most of all. we would like to emphasize that
Middle Earth is primarily staffed by un-
dergraduate volunteers who know that life at
SUNYA can be quite overwhelming and
stressful at times. We would like to offer you
an invitation to use our services to help you
sort things out.

contact

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to Mr. Lissner's
letter to set the record straight. First ofall. I
never rejected Mr. Lissucr‘s proposal to form
contact committees on the quads. l fully en:
dorsc any method that would improve cont-
munication between a Central Council
rept'cscntathc and his ‘ her constituents. As a
matter of fact. l don‘t believe I even have the
constitutional authority to abridge Mr.
Lissnch right to commuiticatc with his con-
stitucnts.

If Mr. Lissner is really interested in cs-
tnblishing a contact group on Colonial Quad.
1 belicvc it would be wise to ask his fellow
(‘olonial representatives if they would be in-
terested in participating.

Finally. I believe Mr. Lissner should really-
cd that this is orin November. and
nominations for President will not be opened
until late March. Until then. Mr. Lissncr
should spend less time campaigningl‘orlheof—
lice and spend tnorc time earning his right to
hold such an oll'icc.

Lacking Reflex Reoction if

Isn‘t there something wrong when the president of Student Associa-
tion sends out a memoto void an unconstitutional motion six days after
it had been passed and two days after a writ issued by the SA Supreme
Court had taken care of the whole matter?

Last week. the AMIA Council suspended One of its members, Andy
Ellner, for allegedly signing ineligible players to his team. Whether he is
innocent or guilty is immaterial. What does matter is that when the '
matter was brought before the SA Supreme Court, the AMlA Council's
ruling was overturned and the suspension declared invalid. Not
satisfied. AMIA. an SA funded group, held an emergency meeting the
morning after the court hearing and passed a motion contradicting the
Supreme Court ruling.

Since the contradictory motion was clearly unconstitutional, freezing
AMIA‘s funds solid is the next logical step. But the executive branch of
SA somehow managed to overlook this. The oversight seems all the
more unusual in light of the fact that SA Controller Nolan Altman is
also a member of AMIA council. and one of Altman's assistants.
Michael Curwin. is president ofAMlA. They should have immediately
questioned the motion.

SA President Steve DiMeo. certainly no stranger to the athletic
world. also overlooked the situation. As chief executive, DiMeo’s duties
include upholding the SA constitution and enforcing the rulings ofthe
Supreme Court. ln this case. he did neither. It wasn‘t until Tuesday.
when an unconstitutionally-suspended Ellner came before the Supreme
Court and requested a Writ of Mandamus. that the wrong was righted
and Ellner was again allowed to participate in AMlA activities.

Di Meo still waited two days afterthe writ was issued to send word out
to AMlA requesting that they reinstate Ellner. Better late than never.

All this would be rather amusing, if not for the fact that these petty,
procedural problems have plagued SA since the start of the semester.
Every time a major issue arose. e.g. the Colonial Parking Lot or the Mis-
sion responses. SA was far too preoccupied with its own internal
problems to deal effectively with it.

What should have been a reﬂex reaction in the AMlA case took
DiMeo almost a week. SA Vice President Gary Parker doesn‘t fare
much better in all this. staying away from the issue for fear of possible
personality conflicts in the executive branch. And if both DiMeo and
Parker fail to react. who's left?
