Does co'ed dorm living mess up
your head? Yes, no and sort of. ac-
cording to two Stanford University
psychiatrist who reported their fin-
dings in Human Behavior
magazine.

The pair quizzed 900 freshmen
students at a large public school in a
small town where most students live
in university housing. They found
that overall. co-ed dorms are more
pleasant, relaxed, friendly, en-
joyable and that the atmosphere
promotes greater personal growth
than single sex living arrangements.

They discovered men who opt for
co~ed living have higher academic
and career goals. who like to drink
beer and who think ofthemselves as
easygoing and“ontop ofthe world."

Women in co-ed housing.
however. were found to be quite
different than their female
classmates stuck in women-only
dorms. Women who lived underthe
same roof as men had higher
academic aspirations. took part in
more social and cultural activities
and engaged in more of what the psy-
chiatrists call “impulsive-deviant
behavior.“ which means they oc-
casionally break school rules and

These women also had a better self

image than other universityfirst year

independence and variety in new ac-
tivities. They also placed less
emphasis on traditional heterosex-
ual dating.
Drop in Goals

One year later the biggest change
for students living in co-ed dorms
was a drop in career goals. Fewer
students still wanted to get that doc-
torate degree that had seemed so im-
portant several months earlier and
they looked with more disfavor on
demanding careers than did other
students who didn‘t live in co—cd
housing.

The two psychiatrists also report
that students from co~ed dorms
made more trips to the student
health center. indicating higher
levels of stress in co-ed living. For
the women however. it might not
have been all that stressful; 21 per-
cent ol' them said they were visiting
the health center for birth control in-
formation. (CPS)

Chimps Tell Men About Earthquakes

predict earthquakes, because they
seem to become abnormally restless
when tremors are on the way. scien-

scientiﬁc evidence that there are
behavior changes that precede earth-
quakes." a group of researchers from
the Stanford University School of
Medicine said Sunday. They ad-
dressed a meeting sponsored by the
U.S. Geological Survey.
Abnormal Behavior

Watching animals for hints of
earthquakes is not a new idea.
Chinese scientists reported that ab~
normal livestock behavior was noted
before a major quake struck the city
of llai-chcng this year.

Dr. l-lelena C. Kraemcr. associate
professor of biostatistics. said the
possible connection between chimps
and earthquakes first emerged when
she was conducting a study of
chimps at the school‘s Outdoor
l’rimate Facilityw-which is adjacent
to the San Andreas Fault.

She said observers at the facility
noticed “intriguing behavioral

changes" among the chimpanzees
prior to a series of minor earth-
quakes last June.

“The animals were more restless
than usual.“ Dr. Kraemer said.
“They spent more time on the
ground than high on their climbing
structures and nesting areas. Their
behavior change was so signiﬁcant.
it seems unlikely it was due to
chance."

At Sunday's meeting. Dr.
Kraemer was joined by Bruce Smith.
a geophysicist with the Geological
Survey. and Dr. Seymour Levine.
professor of psychiatry.

They said they were not prepared
to unequivocally state that the
changes were triggered by the
prospect of seismic activity. But Dr.
Kracmer said. “There Were no un—
usual events which might have caus-
ed the chimpanzees to behave the
way they did."
