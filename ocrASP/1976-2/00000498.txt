Women Find

Power Increasing

LONDON (AP) Women are assum-
ing a growing and more important
role in Western European politics.
stepping into jobs as Cabinet
ministers, pony leaders or top
political aides.

But some who have made it to the
top caution that their political
success doesn‘t mean the battle for
equality is over.

“One must not imagine that the
women‘s issue is suddenly solved
because a woman has become
foreign minister." says Karin Soden,
Sweden‘s first woman foreign
minister. She serves in the centrist
government of Thorbjorn Falldin
which came to power inthe Sept. l9
election.

“l'm tired of being regarded as a
phenomenon." says Margaret
Thatcher. who in February I975
became Britain‘s first woman party
leader. She would also become the
country‘s first woman prime
minister if her Conservative party
wins the next national election.

“The idea of a woman making
decisions and giving instructions is
not yet easily acceptable in Greece
and is viewed suspiciously by some
male colleagues." says Lina
Koutiafri. who in October became
undersecretary of education and
only the third woman since World
War II to holdaGreekcabinet post.

West Germany's outgoing presi-
dent of the Bundestag. the lower
house of parliament. is a woman:
Annemarie Reger.

France. Italy. Britain. Austria.
Greece. The Netherlands and
Sweden all have women in their
Cabinets. Antwerp. Belgium. has a
woman mayor.

llut most ofthem would agree that
women are far from fulfilling their
potential in a ﬁeld longeonsidered in
most countries a bastion of male
chuuvinism.

The relatively recent emergence of
women in Western European
polities may be attributed in varying
degree to women's liberation
movements in their countries. but
few of the successful women
politicians consider themselves mili-
tanl feminists.

HICIN POISONINO

A University of Wisconsin
biochemist says it is possible that the
"Legionnaires Disease." which killed
29 people in Philadelphia last
summer, resulted from a deadly tox-
in which may have been intentional-
ly sprayed into the air. ~
Doctor Edward Schantz suggests
that the possible cause of the
mysterious illness was “Ricin.” a
deadly toxin extracted from castor
beans.

Schantz stresses he has no hard
evidence implicating “Ricin”. and
that another equally deadly toxin
might have been involved. ‘

The doctor states. however. that
he studied the ricin toxin while
. working for the a'rmy at Fort

Dietrick in the l950‘s. He says that
the lung infections and patterns of
death in victims of the Legionnaires
Disease were completely consistent
with ricin poisoning. Hesuggests the
poison might have been ad-
ministered by the use of an aerosol
spray.

Doctor Schantz adds that scien-
tific tests to detect the presence ofthc
toxin in the lungs ofthc victims were
never conducted. He says that it
would probably be “too late“ today
to determine if ricin had somehow
been employed by assassins.

TAX EVADERS

A new study of America's 148
largest corporations indicates that
many of them paid little or no US.

The study. compiled by the House
Ways and Means Committee. found
that ll major corporations used a
variety of loopholes to legally avoid

a all income taxes last year.

Amongthe ll non-tux payers. for
instance. were the Bethlehem Steel
Corporation and the Western Elec-

showed a net profit last year of ap-
proximately $255 million; and
