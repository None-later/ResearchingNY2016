.Tbe eletaion‘is over. the ballots'are in, and

the electoral votes have been counted. Jimmy

Caner made his 22 morah campaign a success

by defeating an appointed president. But, just ‘

as the Nixon pardon brought indignation
among the people who believed that all were

equal under the law. the I976 Presidential.

campaign not only disregarded the law, it
made a farce out- of it.

In I934. Congress passed the Com-
munications Act. It included the now famotts
Section 315. allowingfor equal exposure time
for candidates running for political ofﬁce. The
law applied to all types of broadcasting. in-
cluding television although TV was not a
signiﬁcant medium at the time. Nevertheless.
broadcasters were bound by the law to provide
equal time to all political candidates for ofﬁce.
from county clerk to president.

This brings us to the debates. Not only did
the League of Women Voters disregard the
equal time law. they set'out in the Nixonian
tradition to circumvent it in any way they
knew possible. Ford and Caner knew this. but
they certainly weren't going to argue for the
appearances of any minor party candidates
that might tend to take voters awayfrom their
column.

The League of Women Voters blatantly dis-
missed the appeals of Eugene McCarthy and
Lester Maddox to appear onthe debates. as
required. by law under Section 3 l 5. In fact. all
of the third party candidates technically had a
chance of winrtingthe election, being on the
ballot in enough states to win an electoral ma-
jority.

The legitimacy of these third party can-
didates' campaigns is hardly the point. Those
who based their arguments against these open
forums on the basis of practically miss the en-
tire point behind America's political process; a
process that supposedly allows for anyone

 

,  Exposure Time

with dissenting opinions to obtain national of-

ﬁce and equaltime in the media while attemp-

ting to do so.

During the l976 campaign. we saw that
principle clearly violated. it is interesting to
note that the‘last time Presidential debates
were held. Section 3l5 was suspended by the
FCC so that the networks could not be held
liable for showing other candidates later on.
This time‘around, realizingthat they probably
couldn't get away withtbe same sneaky tactic.
the FCC turned the other check as the League
of Women Voters called the debates “public
forums” instead of news events. The distinc-
tion is curcial. The League invited who they
wanted to meek before a small audience in a
theater. Television would be allowed to cover
the event if they wished.

And to no one‘s surprise. the networks ”

decided to do just that. If the networks had
decided not to cover the event, would the can-
didates have agreed to appear? l thinkjnot.
And why, when the sound disappeared for
nearly half an hour. did the candidates wait for
the television crew to correct the difﬁculties.
instead of continuing on for the studio
audience. who could still hear the candidates?

We see an obvious violation of the public
trust by a variety of interest groups. including
the so-called impartial League of Women
Voters.

The Communications Law of I934 gave
third party candidates the right to be heard as
equals among the major party choices. Twice
in If) years. the American people have been
denied the opportunity to hear dissenting
opinions in a national election.

The future of American democracy rests on
the people. who should realize that it is they
who should make the decision of who they
wish to support. not be dictated bythe League
of Women Voters and the television networks.

setting the
record straight-
To the Elton

We are writing in response to SA President
Steve DiMeo and Central Councilperson Rich
Greenberg's comments in the Fri. issue of the
V ASP: we will now set the record straight.

Mr. Di Men is under the impression that the
four Colonial Quad Central Council represen-
tatives were not working together on the con-
tact committee. It is also interesting to note
that Mr. Greenberg states that Mike Lissncr
implemented the contact committee on his
own. The fact is that Mr. Greenberg wasin
attendance at the Colonial Quad Board
meeting where Mike introduced his proposal
to the dorm representatives. As Colonial
Quad representatives. we expressed our inten-
tions of being active on the contact committee.
To our dismay, Mr. Greenberg did not take
the initiative to play an active part on a com-
mittee which he himself considers an "ex-
cellent idea.”

Mr. DiMeo and Mr. Greenberg claim to
support any method that increases com-
munication between SA and the students. If
so. where has their support for such a plan

Colonial Quad. Central Council represen-
tative Mike McKeown (State Quad) along
with Alumni Quad President Jerry

~ Mandlebaum have expressed their interest in

the committee and are in the process of cs-
tablisbing similar ones on their respective
quads.

The contact committee is not the Wllolt:
answer; it isjust the beginning ofa newtypc ol
student government. If Mike‘s becoming
president is the only way to get SA moving.
then we consider it his responsibility to run for
that ofﬁce.

The Never-Printed Letter

by Jack Slmmom
Dear Penthouse.

i would like tocommendthc people respon-
sible for publishing your f ine magazine. l real-
ly' enjoy your letters. articles and most your
pictorial essays. It‘s a delight to come home
and find your magazine in my mailbox. The
reason I am writing is to relate an experience
and a night I'll never forget. I've been seeing
this girl (l‘ll call her Mary) for the past six
months. Although we usually share common
interests. Mary is what you might call a prude.
She’s the type of girl who meets me on the
front door step for every date. l have never
been inside her house. nor. for that matter.
have i ever met her parents.

Last week. when l arrived at Mary‘s house
for our traditional Fridtty night date. l was
greeted at the front door by a sensational look-
ing chick identifying herself as Mary's sister.
After introducing herself as Shcri. she explain-
ed with regrets. that Mary was visitinga friend
in the hospital. and wouldn't return until later.
Sensing my frustration. Sheri invited me in to
wait. I reasoned with myself; what the bell. the
night was a lost cause anyway. I might as well
hung out. Stepping into the house. I realized
why Mary had never introduced me to her
family. her little sister was it knockout. Look-
ing at Sheri. I‘d say she was about five foot six
and still growing. So was I. She had beautiful
brown hair that fell to her shoulders and
dazzling green eyes. She was wearing a pair of
tigltt jeans that Mother Nature ltadjust finish-
cd filling. and n gttuzc shirt. on which she
hadn‘t done u bad job either. As we were sit-
ting. watclting television. Shcri divulged that
her parents had gone llWily for the wcckcrtd.so
she was the only one ltomc. Occasionally. she
would seductively stroll past me pretending
there was somethingto be done in the kitchen.

After offering me almost everything in the
house. she slid up to me and asked if N like to
play a game. With us much calmness as I could
muster. l inquired as to her meaning. She ex-
plained that although the game involved a cer-
tain amount of risk. a cunning mancould easi-
ly get what he wanted. I laughed to myself:
what ltind of risk were we taking. the house
would be empty for a couple of hours: so i
agreed to play. Sheri instructed me tomeet her
in her bedroom in five minutes. it was then
that I realized this was not the little girl her
parents once knew. Suddenly. I beganto ques-
tion my actionszcertalnlythis wasn't right. but
what the hell, neither was Watergate.

lthink the most difficult thingto do in that

retailing five minutes as payattcntion to ‘tAllln .

the Family“ when Sheri was offering me “Let‘s
Make a Dotti". I couldn't understand how my
super conservative girlfriend could have such
it swinging little sister. Soon. I heard Sheri‘s
voice calling me into her bedroom. Sprinting
down the hall. my head was dizzy with cu-
phoria and l pantcd with excitement.
Reaching her room. I found Sheri Sprilwlcd
out on the bed. with u Monopoly board
between her legs. Slowly. but confidently I up-
proachcd the bed while undoing my neck but-
ton. Sitting down beside her. i looked deep
into her eyes for meaning. After ti tender gu/c.
l understood all: she wanted to bc tltc mctnl
ship. I was powerless and had to respond to
her every whim. She commanded the to rt:—
shufflc the Chance curds. Nervoust she modc
the first move. rolling two sixes and going
directly tojttil. Now it was tnyturn. l‘d ltuvc to
show all my experience. As I began to finger
the dice. she moaned softly. Shc htitcd juil.

After about half an hour of llL’lH)
bottrdpluy. l almost blew my wud. luckily,
Sheri lent me fch thousand dollars and i
stayed in thc game. We were gcttingit on full”)
niccly when we both heard someonc coming
toward the bedroom. “Sheri. are you in your
room?“ I recognized the voice as Mttry's. tion
the hell was I going to explain this to llL‘l'.’
Mary and I had talked at length one night
about social mores. and she confided Ill mc
that group Monopoly was not for her.

it's not that she would put anybody down
for it. she just didn‘t have any prclctcncc
towards it. Hi never forget the look on ltct lilL'L‘
us she opened the door and saw us. But. it
strange thing ltttppcncd. Mury silently up»
prouchcd us ttndsutdown on the bcd. Looking
at me with traces of approval. .shc soitl.“(i1\c
toe the nicest piece possible." To say I was
shocked would be an understatement she
didn‘t seem to mind what was ltttppcntng!
After handing her the silver rttcing cur. shc
screamed with delight and threw the dice. It
wasn't long before she had control of the
whole board. Watching her work the dice rcttl~
ly had affected me. I wanted to get my hands
on that community chest. We stayed up pill)“
ing around the entire night until. out of com-
plete exhaustion. I had to pull out, I stayed
around to watch the two sisters go at it, and it
was a treat. They kept trying to coax me back
in again. but I had had enough.
I haven't seen Mary or Sheri since then. but
that wild. crazy night remains with me always.

many ridiculous answers like “l‘m voting for

W

 

Carter because Gerald Ford is a fucking
moron.” Gerald Ford graduated at the top of
his class' from Yale law school. but undergrads
at our prestigous SUNYA believe that be is
stupid. Another clever remark was “I‘m voting
for Ford because he's doing a great job.”
When these people were asked to give some
examples to back up their point. they usually
mumbled somethingabout being late for class.
There is more to votingthan stepping into a
booth. shutting your eyes and flipping the but-
tons. With a little work, a trained
seal could do that. One should do
some research into the candidates before
be/ she casts their ballot. A democracy cannot
begin to exist in this country until we develop
an informed electorate. It takes no more than
an hour to read some magazine's condensed
form of the candidates' positions. if SUNYA
represents the electoral elite of this country,
then the chances for democracy look slim. By
the way. why did you vote for your candidate?

indiscriminate
honesty

To the Editor:

During the tenure of my ofﬁce I have placed
highest my duty to serve the populous of this
institution to the best of my ability with in-
discriminate honesty and undaunted integrity.

Student Association President Steve
DiMeo would not settle for anythingless and
neither would I. Recently. regarding the com-
ments by Thomas Scherbcnko in the Albany
Student Press. I was understandably upset
and felt a need to express my beliefs.

Motivating me to seek this office was the
lure of power. not power for power's sake. but
power to due good. To work forthe people. to
right some wrongs. and to make this U nivcrsi-
ty a more efﬁcient and productive place for its
inhabitants. All of my energies have been
dcvolcd to these goals. You. the student.
showed faith in me at elcctiott time. and l
assure you that that faith has not been
betrayed.

As for the indignant comments in the ASI’
by Thomas Schcrbcnko. i would like to
apologize to the students ofthis University for

the actions of one of our fellows. I implore
those who read this newspaper. a reflection of
the student body. not to dwell on that isolated
incident in their judgment of this university‘s
student body. In my dealings with other un-
iversity student bodies and the administration
of this one. I have always held our students in
the highest esteem. I assure you this incident
will not change my beliefs.

«I urge all of my fellow students to stop by
[CC 346] and exchange ideas with me at your
convenience. The only way I could be effective
for you is if you communicate effectively with
me.

SA Vice President

coeds complement
coach

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to Lisa Bradley's
letter of October l5. We are also taking PEC
I70-cocd basketball. and we also have Robert
Lewis as our teacher. But we are having none
of the problems that she mentioned in her
letter. We have a fun. competitive class and a
tremendous amount of learning in the line of
basketball skills and bailhandiingtakes place.

Sure. at the beginning it was tough for us.
too. but we wcrcn‘t “asked to drop"thccoursc
and we all stuck it out. Much to our benefit!
We never play girls against the guys. The
coach doesn‘t try to humiliate us. We do play
along with the guys in order to improve our
skills.

of course. we're not suggesting that has ket-
ball remain cocd (we‘d probably suggest just
the opposite); we‘re just saying that Couch
Lewis has been fair with us and has deﬁnitely
tttught good basketball. Perhaps next
semester there will be a girls' class and a guys‘
class and Lisa Bradley can takcthc course and
learn what we‘ve learned» how to play basket-
ball!

Endangering.Ettectlventm § ,
Perhaps in reaction to the antagonistic relationship between last 1
year's Badman-Meckler empire and the Fields regime, Student '

Association President Steve DiMeo has been bending over backwards
to engender good feeling between this year's SA and the administration.
This is, in theory, a good thing. But as a student representative, DiMeo
has been bending over too far, endangering the power of his office,

endangering his own effectiveness, and at the very least, endangering his .

own spine. .

When SUNYA students returned to school this semester, they found
the number of library operating hours drastically reduced. Early in
September, Di Meo threatened to organize a protest if the library hours
weren't completely restored within a week. A week passed, the hours
were not completely restored, and DiMeo remained dissatisﬁed.
Administrators cited red tape as the problem and suggested waiting it
out. DiMeo apparently took their advice. since there never was a
protest. And everyone‘s still waiting.

Later in the semester, bulldozers rolled in to scrape and level off a
grassy area near Colonial Quad. Construction was finally to begin on a
long-planned parking lot. A group of Colonial students rallied to block
construction. DiMeo negotiated with the administration and came out
conceding defeat, having settled for a compromise — winning the
student some concessions which included neither building the parking
lot elsewhere not killing it completely.

Instead of confiding in SA Vice President Gary Parker and his other
colleagues, Di Meo has fallen into the unfortunate habit of running to
the adminstration whenever the milk spills. At the same time, Parker
and the members of SA have lent DiMeo little guidance and support.

Administration advice is fine for a well-rounded perspective, but all
too often DiMeo is not skeptical enough. He swallows too much too
fast. without scrutinizing his sources and ends up losing his student
perspective.

No executive can be expected to function as a separate entity.
Politically. varied personalities are healthy. A most pressing internal
need at SA is a cabinet for DiMeo. He needs a group of students to
advise him, to channel information and ideas to him. Right now it seems
that his cabinet is over in the administration building, and that's no way
to run any student government.
