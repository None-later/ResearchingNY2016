ly ED MOSER

There are some performers so out-
standing that. even when cast in a
secondary role. they go on to steal
the show. Such a musician is Lou
London, who was sideman for
f olksinger Seul-Broudie at the Freeze
Dried Coffeehouse this past
weekend.

Broudy himself is no slouch. A
man who pursued graduate study in
folklore at the University of Penn-
sylvania. Broudy has great varictyin
his songs and subject matter. But
putting London on the same stage
with him is like an Eric Clapton
appearance at a John Mayall con-
ccrt. The instrumentalist wizard is
bound to upstage the man with top
billing.

London nigh savcdthc first halfof
Broudy's show. Perhaps because of
his long study of folklore. llroudy
tcnds to treat his material too
professionally. He often sounded
like a music professor demonstrating
a piece in class. instead of an cntcr-
tainer who must cnthrall his
audience. He came on a tad too
restrained. Take the words of the
.lohnny Cash tunc ‘l chcr Got Over
Those Bluc Eycs‘:

‘l “'0 them l'l't‘l‘ll'ii‘flt’rt'.

I mi.\'.\' I/it' armx I/rrtl held me.

When all the low was tlwrr.’

This is tcar-jcrkcr material worthy
of Loretta Lynn. But when liroudy
mouthed these words. he merely

accompaniment on acoustic, steel
guitar. made the listeners feel the
lyrics. in Hank Williams ‘l‘m So
Loncsomc l Could Cry‘. London's
steel guitar conveyed the specific
sound of a “lonesome whippoorwill“
of the general sentiment of heart-
break. A wonderfully sensuous.
resonating sound. like the cchocs
produced in the sound chamber-
bclfry of a cathedral.

The show eventually turned into
an impromptu atmosphere of mad
fun. Tuning up for a song. Broudy‘s
burp and London's mandolin im-
itated the banjo duel of
"Deliverance." One particularly
anarchistic piccc combined elements
of a German ballad. a country walla.
and the ‘sound off-«one. two. three.
lourvrsound ofl'!‘ army marching
chant of old World War ll movies.

liroudy was now successfully
playingthc rolc of a Davc llromhcrg.
serving as a translator oftraditional
American music and a lightning rod
lor super accompanying musicians.

’l‘hat 'supcr musician‘ in this all
too short last set was Lou London.
How to describe his incredible inan-
dolin play‘.’

London stands. his face impish.
his eyelids fluttering. his trembling
i'acc breathing in each note. Hc
adores every moment. When he
plays fast. his notes tumblc over one
another in cxhiliaraling quickness.
likc a runaway laugh one can no
longer control. When ltc plays slow.

in the last set. London‘s virtuosity
was aided by bass player Dave
(iromlcy (who was difficult to hear
earlier) and a friend of Broudy‘s who
joined in on drums. The result was a
richer sound. Many thanks to Saul
Brody for a fine show. and to Lou
London for a super performance.
That‘s the only kind of performance
Lou London gives.

A Lilting Musical Vignette

By JAMES W. REILLY

On Saturday night. Blandine
Vcrlct played a pedal-less skinny
grand piano and a horizontal grand-
father clock with keys to a near
capacity crowd in the l’AC‘s Recital
Hall. Actually. the instruments were
harpsichords. early ancestors of the
piano. The works performed were by
Conpcrin. Scarlatti. and Bach. fam-
cd scvcntccnth Century composers.
For those of you who have never
heard of a harpsichord. this instru-
ment produces a beautifully lilting.
delicate sound.

The works composed for the in-
strument arc fascinatineg complex
and cxtrcmcly graceful picccs, re-

quiring thc utmost skill and
familiarity with the instrument for
successful performance. Ms. Verlet.
a renowned French harpsichordist.
with her own gracc. sensitivity and
virtuosity, completed the triangle of
instrument. composition. and artist
that makes for an extraordinary pcr-
formancc.

The first half, which featured
works by Louis and Francois
Coupcrin. was satisfying and
llawlcssly performed by Ms. Vcrlct.
However. it did not compare with
the intricacy. energy. and over-all
musicality of thc liach and scurlatti
pieces of the second half of the
recital. The high point was Scarlat-

ti‘s sonata in D Major. K49], per-
formed with concentrated intensity
by Ms. Verlet.

Ms. Vcrlct. her hands moving
fluidly over the keyboard. her eyes
intent on her music. her body slowly
swaying. or pitching forward quickly
during a particularly intense
passage. hcid all eyes on her.

Ms. Vcrlct acknowledged the
applause of the audiencethree times.
and on the third bow. announced in.
acccntcd but perfectly clear English.
“1 do not usually play encore. but for
that. i will“. The encore was ap-
preciated. and the house lights came
on before the last few hands had
stripped clapping.
