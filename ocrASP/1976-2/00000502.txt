Albany took over.

Four plays later. on a third and
passing situation, the Plattsburgh
secondary was caught playing close
up to the Dane ends. Fullback
DeBlois burst through the middle
and galloped 70 yards for ascore. as
the Albany bench prayed no one
would "clip". No one did. The final
score of the made it 27-0.

Following the game. Dane coach
Bob Ford said, “it's tough when you
win 27-0 and it still leaves a bad taste
in your mouth.” The reason Ford
could complain about a shutout vic-
tory was the fact that he witnessed

And so it went. Plattsburgh was is
beaten team. but Albany couldn't
score off them after 9:04 of the se-
cond quarter.

That‘s why Coach Ford could say.
“We played like we played
throughout the year—sporadically."
Ford added he didn't feel the Danes
were ready for their ﬁnal game
against Springfield this Saturday at
SUNYA.

Well. the Danes could take pride
that they did win. and they did have
one good half. They just hope they
can put one and one together when
they play Springﬁeld.

Sophomore surprise Mark Lavan
led the Albany squad for the first
time, ﬁnishing 'scventh overall to
make the all-upstate team.

'Lavan, who is called ‘L. P.’ byhis
teammates, ran the extremely hilly

“‘I'n'i really tickled. " said barrier
coach'l‘eith Munsey of the relatively
small 36 second spread among
Albany's top five runners. Munsey
praised Lavan as “really coming
along". and said the soph's improve-
ment was due to the hard Workouts
he subjected himself tothis summer.

The Danes have one more cross-
sountry meet left. the lC4A meet on
Monday, November l5th. Afterthat
comes indoor season. and Munsey
complains that because of a slashed
budget. he will have to restrict the
number of indoor performers to
about 25. '
