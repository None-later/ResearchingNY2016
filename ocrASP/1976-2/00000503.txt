the Golden Eagles handed the Danes
a 2-l defeat before an estimated
crowd of 300—seeond largest of the
season.

nothing left but the memories of the

“The kids played really hard." said
a downcast Albany soccer. coach
William Schieffelin. “But they just
couldn’t do it."

But they almost did. Trailing 1-0
for what seemed like the entire game.
Albany forward Frank Selcahad tied
the score with a point-blank goal off
a scramble with only 18 minutes
remaining in the contest.

It seemed like that would be the
springboard the hosts needed to turn
the game around. The Danes seemed
fired-up. and, as the seconds wore
down. it seemed that. if Albany did
not score. it would surely go into
overtime.

But not this day. Brockport had
cleared the ball out of their own end
and made one final attack with only

Stanley Gage made a desperate
attempt to save it. He did. but unfor-

hands—something only a goalie can
do.

Armstrong‘s shot was sent over
the net. but he was awarded a penal-

Armstrong came in alone on Arango
and booted a blistering shot to the
upper left corner of the net. Arango
lay helplessly on the ground for

at 5:34 of the first. and Brockport led

Danes Blank Plattsburgh, 27-0

by Ed Moser

The Albany Great Danes football
squad scored four touchdowns in the
first half Saturday en route to a 27-0
shutout of the Plattsburgh Cardinals
at Plattsburgh. The victory evened .
the Danes‘ record at 44 and gave the
team a shot at ending the season over
.500 with a win against Springfield
next week.

A Dane blitzkrieg in the opening
two quaners was followed by a
bumbling. lackluster second half in
which neither team scored.

After an exchange of downs
following the kick-off, the Danes
proceeded to annihilate Plattsburgh
with four consecutive touchdown
series. each characterized by the “bi g
play”.

But the Danes were not through.

UAS showed net profits in every

ficials from the Albany area.

regents have called for the Com-
missioner‘s resignation or retire-
ment. The Regents and Nyquist have
had ongoing disagreements concer-
ning their respective authority over
the department.
