An attempt to form a graduate
tudent association at SUNYAis he-

" ing made by three students working

in conjunction with the Student Ae-

,, tivities Ofﬁce.

According to coordinators John
Campbell, Paul Kellerhouse and

_ Spencer Adams. an organization of
I this type is necessary to facilitate the
. special needs of SUNYA graduate

students. "There is no campus-

, wide graduate association for grad
‘students to turn to." said

Kellerhouse.

Kellerhouse and Campbell believe
that the graduate population of
SUNYA. which comprises ap-

7 proximately one-third of the entire

student population. is not adequate.

‘ I Iy represented in Student Associa-

tion or in the University Aux-
iliary Services. They pointed out that
there is no place that helps graduate
students deal with their unique
employment. housing. and financial
problems.

Campbell stressed that there are
very few ways for graduate students
to meet each other. “Most grad
students don‘t know very many peo-
ple who are not in their particular

graduate program.“ _

One of the am functions of a
graduate student association on the
SUNYA campus would be to plan
social events for graduate students.

Campbell and Kellerhouse stress-
ed that a graduate association would
not compete with the, various
departmental grad programs on
campus It would serve to help the
various groups unite. “After all."
said Kcllerhouse. “we have common
needs, and there is definitelystrength
in numbers." ‘ ‘

Active Members

Although Adams. Campbell and
Kellerhouse are initiating the forma-
tion of a graduate student associa-
tion. they stated that after they help
to lay the foundation of this associa-
tion. they would not seek leadership
positions in the drganization. They
do hope to be active members in the
association.

Any graduate student who wishes
to voice his opinions and interests
concerning the formation of a
graduate student association is urg-
ed to attend an organizational
mectin on Thursday. Dec. 2 from
two to six in the Campus Center
Assembly Hall.
