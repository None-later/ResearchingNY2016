its “Noxema Medicated Skin
Cream” by saying “No soap or cream
does so much to make you look so
beautiful.” Not so. according to the
FTC. Noxcma is acutaliy only “as
good as a moisturizer” as Revlon‘s
“Moon Drops" and Helena
Rubenstein‘s "Kin Dew.” and only
as effective but not more so than its
two main competitors.

The FTC questioned Bristol-
Meyers on its claim that its
medicated soap called “Fostex” was
"recommended by more physicians
than any other acne product.“ The
company replied that its early ad
campaign was aimed at der-
matologists so its sales were
necessarily based on doctor
recommendations.

The Pentagon is currently

costly. However. the center warns
that a U.S. effort to build cruise mis-
