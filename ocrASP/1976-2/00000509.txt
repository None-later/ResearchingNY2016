ideas are usually expressed to us by
way of short summaries extracted
from foreign newspapers. Here at

NOVEMBER 12, 1976

“Reflections”, a work in water-color on paper is quite
fine. The simple vertical striations seem to move in and
out of the picture plane. His “Billboard Landscape"
with a rougher and more painterly application of paint
to the canvas is strongly recessionai. The vertical lines of
color in horizontal bands show a fine demonstration of
Taylor‘s control ofcolor. If any objectioncan be voiced.
it is that this style ofwork is ratlrerlimiting. The number
of expressive variables on 'l‘aylors theme is closed.

The work of Owen Rhodes’faces stronyr objections.

 
 
 

 

By STEPHEN EISENMAN

The new exhibit at the SUNYA art gallery features
the work of a teacher from Williams college.
and two SUNYA Masters candidates. one quite
talented, and the other. not so talented.

0f the two masters candidates. the work of Peter
Taylor is certainly the liner. His linear. grid-like
abstractions are visually exciting. His use of briglu
colors or pastel shades within forms that seem to reeedo
or burst forward, is an attempt to harmonize gestural
with geometric abstraction. Certainly the late work of
Paul Klee and Hans Hoffman inﬂuenced Mr. Taylor. .‘
There is too the tactile qualities of a Jasper Johrl. ‘

   
    

   
   

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

  

His work. a kind of painterly photo-realism. is
unoriginal. and unaesthetic. Perhaps he objects to the
seeming detachment to be found in photo-real works. if
so. he has found no solution.

His work suffers from his devotion to tromp l‘ocil
objects. as seen in his Peto-like fastening of objects to
neutral colored wall surfaces. His command of color is
strong however. as seen in his “Wallpiece”.

The best work in the show is that of Marilyn
(iiersbach, Her use ofcolluge elements on large, roughly
stretched canvassus is striking. She employs cloth.
stcnciling. fur. design elements. and both tight and
expressionist painting. Her “Painting with Bottles". is a
fine harmonizing of De Kooning brushwork with hard
edge diagonals. and suspended painted bottles. This
ready made aspect crcnics real space in the canvas. and
is visually arresting.

Her finest work though is “Romanesque List". Herc
Ms. Uicrsbuch has tried to express the world of
architecture by thejuxtnposing ofsqunres (denoting the
: real clcme nts of building) with stenciled words from the

language of architecture (basilica, transept. spandrel.
etc.) The result. though a bit awkward. is a real feeling
for an interior architecture. Indeed most of her works

another country. Being a place of
higher learning, it seems only logical
to address ourselves to the topic of
education systems in our interviews
with faculty representatives from
France, lndia and Great Britain.

it seems that the most salient
characteristic of American higher
education is its informality. in one of
her observations. a Frenchwoman
mentioned her shock at seeing a
professor sitting on a desk with his
lets folded beneath him. directing
vulgarisms toward his students. As
regards the students. this same
woman noticed one of her students
remarking aloud in the class that he
was hungry.

This lack of decorum is even more
pronounced to people from Great
Britain, where the universities are

(the artists confrontation with the canvas) as about the
subjects she seems to be representing.

more academically elite. This is due
to the small number of universities
there, as well as the entire
“sociology” behind it. Only a very
small proportion of the population
enters college. meaning also that
most graduates are easily welcomed
into the job market. Since it is so
common then to ﬁnd oneself in a
lecture situation, where asking
questions is discouraged. the
students are assigned to tutors.
These people. almost comparable in
service to our advisers. provide the
link between student and instructor.
in lndia. the formality
question turns into one
of detachment. The system
there includes large lecture courses.
at the end of which (two years later)
one is required to take an examina-
tion to determine if he may continue.
Because of this great amount of time
before evaluations. the majority of
students tend to concentrate most of
their efforts at the very end of the
two year cycle. Therefore. despite
the fact that asking questions is per-
mitted. most students are seldom
prepared enough to do so. Then too,
the professors are not the examina-
tion proctors. and so they are not all
that important to the student.
Many contrasting opinions con-
cerning ﬁnancing of higher educa-
tion, admittance of students to in-
sititutions of higher learning.
facilities and the students themselves
exist. However. representatives from
England. France. and India all agree
that there is a great deal more
freedom in America in choosing
courses. Whether or not this system
of many electives ill good is

debatable. As a British faculty
member stated. the United States'
method tends to produce more well-
rounded citizens. whereas the British
system sets out to (and succeeds in)
producing specialists.

As to financing. an interesting
contrast exists. in India, where
colleges are run for profit. it would
probably be easiest for youths of
woalthier families to attend schools.
The government does. however.
provide scholarships for those
students who show great promise.
lndian society does inﬂuence this,
though. by means of the caste
system. Besides that, family ties are
so strong that a great many students
prefer lo commute to school daily.
rather than living away from home.

in England. the local county
governments pay for students to at-
tend universities. This creates many
disparities due to the varying degree

'of wealth in each county. There

might also be a cenain amount of
money donated to students by the
federal government in the form of
centralized grants.

France. on the other hand. may
boast a more socialized system of
higher education. The federal
governmnet contributes a great deal
of money toward those entering
colleges, depending upon both
merit. and the ﬁnancial status ofthe
student's family.

Admissions to British schools are
handled departmentally. This means
that people are accepted into their
major field. and start specializing
immediately. Changing ﬁelds is
more difﬁcult as a result. although
not impossible by any means.

Because of the lndian policy that
anyone who can afford to go to
college may do so. admissions are
not really a very crucial point.

Students in France must pass an
examination known as the “Bac.” In
essence. this test may verywell deter-
mine a person's future. The Bac is
known to be extremely difﬁcult,
although in recent years there have
been some calls for reforms. it is said
.that the higher grades being ob-
tained on this exam are indicative of
aneedtoinereasethedifﬁcultyofthe
Bac

Although all of the schools dis-
cussed are coeducational (with the
exception of the few all-female
schools in India). there do urisesome
differences in attitudes. One of the
contrasts drawn between French
students and American students is

‘that those in the U.S. tend to lack
responsibility. American students
have been said to be spoiled in that
all is organized for them and made
easy. This is most pronounced here
by the fact that there aren't any
strong “student unions" here
because of lack of need. The other
shocking contrast involves the
statistics of drop-outs. The French
schools sustain a much greater

' number of students leaving before
graduation than their American
counterparts.

Finally. the British system in-
volves only a few exams. Tito main
difference between the two nstlons‘
tests. besides frequency. involves
form. it is very rare to see the objec-
tive multiple-choice type of test in
England. Essays are much more

 

 

prevalent.
