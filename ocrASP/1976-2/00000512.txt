I * This a" not-an impartial review of
Linda Ronstadt‘s neWest album. nor
could it be. I am too strongly of the
opinion that Ronstadt is a naturally
brilliant. if not fully developed.
4 singer. I am too fond of her previous
albums and performances. though
they are fraught with ﬂaws in many
areas. Andi run too taken by her im-
age onthe album cover. though i like
to think that appearances bear no
relationship to performance (or its
impression thereof).

Linda Ronstadt is now thirty
years old. Until now. she has tried lit-
tle in the way of diversification or
growth. She has done little in the
way of surrounding herself with
quality musicians or capable
producers. It has been said that until
Ilurlt'n Down the Wind, it less than
inspired group of people directed-—
or. more appropriately. subducdv

 

'hertalcnt.

They are producers like JD.
Souther. a confused mixture of
romantic interest and professional
performance; and Peter Asher. in-
itially influenced little by Soother
(llr'urt like a Wheel). then succum-

ovcrbcatcn style (Prisoner in Dir-
guise).

'l'hcy are musicians like Kenny
Edwards. one of the Stone Poncys
who had to hangonto Linda and her
success for his next meal: and An-
drew (iold. who travels and tours
with Ronstadt as her warm up. try-
ing to strike out on his own and not
succeeding.

Arid they are recording engineers
Ii kc Val Garay and Dave Hassingcr.
who decided that Linda Ronstadt‘s
vocal performances were secondary
to her albums. that they were more
appropriately buried under eight
superfluous tracks. A distracting
and unnecessary amount of
reverberation. ridiculous ideas
about equalizing for a "brcathy"
sound. forgivable technical errors
(|’-l’opping and breath blasting. cs-
pccially on Ileurt and Prisoner) and
a lack ofclear direction succeeded in
badly mttddling a voice that should
ltave been enhanced and prominent.

Until "(It'lt‘ll ‘l)ou'n the Wind.
they directed her talent.

Linda Ronstadt is now thirty
years old. And recent years have ap-
parently blessed her with sufficient
insight to realize that she was
stagnaling.

The people are tltc some. The
music is not. Huston Downthe Wind
is the most significant recording of
Linda Ronstadt since she first began
with the Stone l’oncys.

She is experimenting. botlt with
different material and vocal styles.
She has discovered the songwriting
talents of Karla Bonoff. whose thrcc
contributions offer Ronstnndt the
opportunity to expand her dynamic
“08¢. to be powerful and stylized
without constantly having to resort
to the heavy-handed “raw power
from the gut" screams that inc vitttbly
concluded most of her performances
on most of her albums for most of

 

her recording years. Now the emo-

that sends chills through and

I was especially taken with the
opening number. the Bonoff tune

a brilliant piece of writing and a
moving performance by Ronstadt.

Unfortunately. tltc opening to the
second side was not ill keeping with
tltc quality spoken of thus far on
acapella of a spiritual-sounding
number called “l'hc Rivers of
Babylon." Ronstadt has not yet
matured to tltc point of beingablc to
sacrifice long-standing tradition and
friendships in lltt: name of quality.
The same cloudyjudgement was ex-

Legalize It

By BRUCE ('()NN()|.I.Y

Us whiteys have to face tltc fact
that a lot ol tltc current fascination
with reggae stems from tltc wltolc
Noble Savage lantasy that‘s always
ltad us by tltc balls. With their out-
wardly casual pose when it comes to
tltc squalor and everyday horrors of
Jamaican life. these tough. lean
Rastas. masked beltind that
pcrpcltral cloud of herb smoke. cf-
lot‘tlcssly play rigltt into this role.

We're charmed by their
roguishncss and ertd ttptltinkingt ltat
yes the world is full of misery and
suffering but isn't it kind of enter»
taining and isn‘t it kind of cute?
chsir. we're pretty sick gringos and
we're infected with sortie weighty in-
tcrnal disorders that have to be
worked ottt. individually and collec-
tively. But that‘s us. The music and
the musicians aren‘t at fault. All they
do is give us a chance to expose
ourselves. Let‘s talk about Peter
Tosh.

l’ctcr 'l'osh is so cool ltc can't even

ideas into it: il‘ranslati‘tiiir-most of
tltc lp is only good. and bits of it are
great.

Nothing like getting banned in
Jamaica to feed the hype machine in
the U.S. Legalize It serves up stan-
dard reggae themes but Peter Tosh
treats the sacred subject of ganja
playfully enough. udvcrtizing its
medicinal properties and notingthat
people in high places doctors.
lawyers. and players of instruments
toowsmokc it all the time. Burial].
the second cut. stands Out as the lp's
highest point.

lts opens with a just barely am-
bulatory. heavy-lidded brass section
and erupts into the rivctting percus-
sion work and merciless rhythm that
cltaructcrilcs Jamaican music. With
tltc Wailers. l’ctcr's brillitrnt. cf-
l’ortlcss singing talents were
overshadowed by Bob Marley. who
is my current pick forthc world's No.
l male vocalist. (Latcly Jagger‘s
tcrtdcd to oversing; Marley gets the
nod for his subtlety and control.)

W lti lc Peter 'I oslt's voice lacks the
dexterity Marley displays. it‘s got a
much warmer emotive quality.
Marley‘s restraint cart be in-
timidating at times. maybe because
he doesn't necessarily want you to
enjoy hearing what he's singing
about.

The jumpy lt’ltu/clut Gonna Do
starts out with deceptively casy
humor. Papa‘s injnil and I‘m on tltc
run. Sowhat else is new in Babylon?
And then it hits you that no matter

goodbye. mon. Detention means
you to get to change your permanent
address. Permanently.

reggae and American soul. Only I ltcy

folk poetry rationalizations. This
stuff is real. It counts. l’octry‘s sup-
posed to bend Words till they break
through. to shake words till new
meanings fall out.

Reggae just might make Anglo-
American music obsolete. lt accom-
modates rock. pop. country and
western. and soul within one
vigorous framework. It's youravant
gardc fascination with gradual
processes. only with a big beat. Even
with its faults. Legalize It still sounds
like a one-man coup d‘ctat.

Maybe her record company;le
maintaining very tight artistic cori-
trol over what is released on her
albums. Thus' a potentially great
composer and performer, comes off
sounding watered down and com-
mercial. The music can be very simp-
ly explained by one word: DISCO.
Ons song really sounds pretty much
like another. There is a medley of
two more disco songs with that
Barry White feel to them; “Shouldl
Stay“ and “I Won‘t Let You Go".

 

The words to but h are veryscxual. as
might be inferred from the titles.
The highlight ofthe album is a fine

version of Bobby Womack‘s
"Daylight". a disco song about all
night disco parties. I

“Something. Like a Dream" is a
disco low song about‘how n1 uch you
mean to her and how much she needs
run. the following lines from the
chorus might give you an idea where
the song is cooling from:

"Lovin' you has made Int’jlll‘l who
/ rmt.

I’t/led my every need and it 3‘ been
lovin' you

'Ihul'r meant more to me than
(tor/hing hif/ore.

Side 'lwo begins with a Frank
Sinatra style ballad called. “Let Me
Down Easy". The lyrics seem very
banal and insincere.

'l he album ends with "After All This
time“. a disco song with a sort of
lalin fch to it.

In closing. Vicki Sue Robinson's
singing on all of the cuts is excellent.
but everything else about the album
seems rathcr shallow and un-
interesting. If the record company
stops using her as a puppet and cuts
all of those strings. we could ltcar
something exceptional.

 

Benson

T 0 Play

 

 

 

By KEITH GRAHAM

AM radio cart do fttnny things to
an image of an artist. Take guitarist
George Benson. He has been playing
superior jazz for years. but wasn't
noticed by most people until he
recorded his hit single “This Mas-
qucradc."

Benson though. has been playing
the guitar since the age of eight. Ear-
ly in his teens. he branched out from
his native Pittsburgh area and hit the
“cltittlin" and gravy circuit ofmostly
small southern towns. During these
days. Benson occasionally sting.
while playing tltc blues.

At the age of l9. Benson joined
Jack McDuft‘s group in the early
'60‘s. Alter his stint with McDuff. he
went on the play with artists such as

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Stanley 'l'urrcntine. Freddie Hub-
bard. attd Charles Crawford.

At one point, Benson did a Public
Broadcasting Service Special with
Jack Benny. The set consisted of
several tunes that Benny originally
recorded with legendary guitar
great. Charlie Christian. After Ben-
son's playing. all Benny could do was
smile at the man. He seemed to be
playing the music as it should be
played.

But it was only with his hit single
"This Masquerade". that Benson
finally made it big. Sincethen. he has
been headlining marry concerts and
festivals across the nation. On Fri-
drty. November l9. Albany will be
given a taste oftltis man‘s playing at
tltc Palace Theatre. J
