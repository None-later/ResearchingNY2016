One of the largest research efforts
ever ~nia‘de in classical studies. a
milion-dollar project called
Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG),
is underway at the University of
California. Irvine. according to Jim
Orris of Varian Data Machines. Ir-
vine California.

The project involves the collection
and storage of a vast file of 90 million
words. the total body of Greek
writing. The collection will enable
classical scholars to study how
words were used and how their
meanings and semantic shadings
have changed over the years.

“The finished thesaurus will
provide humanities scholars in such
fields as history. philosophy,
philology. and literature with an in-
valuable reference work designed to
aid them in interpreting and un-
derstanding the written records of
the past.” explains project director

“Anyone can succeed in starting
their own business with only a little
capital. and the opportunities for
such are greater now than ever
before." according to Ted Nicholas.
author. businessman. and self-made
millionaire.

Mr. Nicholas gave two lectures at

i SUNYA Tuesday. in honor of

Career Day.

Career Day. an event that took
place in the Campus (‘enler
ballroom. was sponsored by Delta
Sigma Pi. 'l'he Placement Office. and
the School of Business in order give
SlJNYA students a better perspec-

Mr. Nicholas‘ afternoon speech.
entitled: “(‘areei' Altei'natnes and
the l‘rce Enterprise System." took
place III the Assembly Room before
it lairlysuutll audience. lle geared his
talk toward an audience of students
who were. in his words. “ Most likely
going itito the business field."

He began his lecture by telling
those present how he managed to
build tip at business of 2| cor~
poriitions with only $800 to invest.
He said. “At the age of 22 I wanted to
go into the candy manufacturing
business. so I borrowed money for a
building. equipment. and raw
materials to start, l was $96,000 in
debt when I first started. but within
it) years I had 3(lstores insixstates.“

Mr. Nicholas clniincd that
everyone who was present had the
ability to do the same thing. and
said. “'l'hc opportunities now are
greater than ever before. All you
need to start your own business is it
strong desire. and tin interest coin-
pittible with the environment. and
with whttt others want and need " He
also said. "Formal education is
helpful for such an undertitking. but
not absolutely necessary. I, myself.

He was also strongly advocating
the free enterprise system which we
enjoy in this country. and contrasted
it with that of Socialist ttnd Coniv

The computer facility used in the

TLG project incltides a Varian 620L
minicomputer linked to a Varian
States 3! ll Electrostatic
Printer/ Plotter. The Varian‘s main
function is to work in conjunction
with the printer/plotter to produce
hard-copies of the texts. in Greek.
Russian. or large-font English. A
teleprinter is also connected to the
MK Varian mincomputer which
connects over campus telephone
lines. in distributed system fashion.
to a Sigma-7 central campus com-
puter.
The central computer. which is used
to read and store the Greek texts in
coded form. also connects to three
teleprinters and a displaytermintil in
the TLC project offices.

850 B.C.. upto600A.D..wil|becod-

When a speciﬁc word needs to be
studied. the computers. using TLG-
developed programs. will produce
listings ofeach instance ofthc word‘s
appearance with its appropriate con-
text tind word grouping.

The listings are then to be sent to
cooperating scholars around the;
world who will provide semantic in-
formation about the word as used by
a given author. taking into account
the historical period and the literary
context. I

The permanent TLG editorial
staff. assisted by research assistants.
will collect and edit all the received
materials. enter them into the com-
puter data base. and publish the
Greekthesaurus. So far. 80tape reels
containing l8 million wards of raw
data have been recorded. The first
volumes of the thesaurus are ex-
pected to be issued before l980.

The computer processing of the
first 20«mi|lion words (from Homer
through 200 A.D.) represents the
project's initial phase. Then. ap-
proximately 70-million additional
wards will be processed. taking the
project through the sixth century
A.D.. which marks the transition
from ancient to medieval Greek
society.

In many years. probably after the
lifetimes of all involved in the TLG
project. the articles will becompiled
to form the thesaurus consisting of

ittotily believed that most
businessmen arc crooks. and of
course there are some. bill of those

Mr. Nicholas was dressed in a
flashy three-piece stiit. atid wore a
hall-dollar medallion arotind his
neck. anti rings on almost every

two unsuccessful corporations. both

times. and backed up his beliels with
evidence of his success under the
American economic system.

that. “We‘re all luckon be born in a
country that allows us to be free."
and “I hope we‘ll make good use of
this free enterprise system by trying

business system such as starting your

Mr. Nicholas has l9 successful
corporations. and is president of six
of them. Some of these. are a candy

 

and ice cream company. a real estate
