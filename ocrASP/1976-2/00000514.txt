tleld tiasco‘

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter as both a student and
an avid soccer fan. After seeing the Brockport
soccer game last Saturday. I am convinced
that at least one of the University‘s priorities
concerning sports is out of place.

The Albany State Soccer Team, whose
success depends on their skillful dribblingand
ball-control. was forced to play on a worse
than poor field. in two inches of mud. instantly
nullifying boihtalents. It was heartbreaking to
see the likes of Chcpe Ruano. Johnny Rolan-
do. l’rapk Selea. Matty Denora and others
begin to move the ball only to have it taken
away: not by a llrockport player, but by the
riiiid or by one of the lake-sited puddles that
filled the field.

There were other fields. much dryer and
more level. that could have been tiscd. 'l‘lie
lacrosse field next to the gym is one example.
Why wasn‘t the game played tliere'.’ Because
two high school girls'ft'c/rl ’lf]('l\'l"l' Ieottts were
on it. Now. I have nothing against wotitcn
(God knows. I love ‘em). I even like High
School and Field Hockey. But when one ofthe
University's own teams is playing for an

NCAA Championship bid. yoii'd think‘thcy‘d "

get the best field to play on. Such was not the
case.

i and the thirty or so other members of
Potter Club who watched the game are tip--
pulled by the fiasco Saturday past. Nothing
can be done now, of course. htit as students.
we feel it our obligation to let the University
know when thcyfuck up. And believe me.tlic_v
lucked tip.

stopping
the stereoptype

To the Editor:

Satire at the expense of others is not ltinny.
The publication (ifsuclt satire by a paper such
as the AA'I’. especially if that satire promotes
prejudicial views. is poor journalism. I am
referring to David Goldman's "article" on
fraternities in last Friday‘s ASI‘. Asa member
ofu frat here at SUNYA. in particular the one
whose freshman letter Mr. (ioldman found so
funny. I must take offense.

A lot of work went iitto the writing ol that
letter. with the primary intent of trying to rid
this campus of the fraternity stereotype Mr.
Goldman so obviously believes in. By printing
his column. the A SPis sanctioning a prejudice
that would never have made II to print if the
writer had substitttted the name of any
cultural group for that of a fraternity.

From his "article" it appeared Mr. (iold-
man never visited it frat rush function; when
contacted. he reluctantly iidmittcd to this. It's
amazing how it person with no basis for corti-
ment can so ignorantly put down an entire
Blimp. The State University is allowing
national fraternities back on campus because
it has ﬁnally recognized the ridiculousness of
the “Greek stereotype"; it's a shame people

like Mr. Goldman haven't. j
Greek life at SUNYA is analternative living
experience. It Would be more productive in the
future to find out what we're really like. in-
stead of so blatantly knocking us.

To the Editor:

' How funny that in this massive creation.
itime doesn‘t even seem to work. As l notice
that every clock and every bus and every
meeting and cultural event ritns at its own
time. I am filled with disdain. And now the
bells that tell the hour are even hearing a
different drummer. I mean. really. can't this
increasingly mecltani/cd and systcmiled and
objectivity seeking place get that togetlier‘.’ But
for another part of me. the more important
part i think. this whole off-beat time thing is
delightt til. Hearingthe cliimc songat a quarter
to the hour fills me with a sense of freedom.
freedom from the regitneiitcd and dry. Maybe
still there is hope that creativity. imagination.
sensitit tty and all those othertliings that make
life for the living will not be totally smothered
by those who nurture their stone garden.

best of the
bureaucratic

To the Editor:

Matty times iii tltc academic career of a
SUNYA student does he she havetodeal with
bureaucratic ‘otlices. ‘ the na «Bursar.
Registrar. and Admissions are very comiitun
to us all. l liese oltiees are always bustling with
actiuty. liiiiidliiig student queries and dispos-
ing ol their problems (either by solving or
molding them) ill their efficient. impersonal
manner. I'm sure you‘ve all experienced this.
and |‘\c seen many disgusted and frustrated
people leaving otir bureaucratic establish-
iticnl.

ill my most recent of these encounters. l
visited the registrar‘s office with a few
questions concerning my academic classifica—
iioit aitd prcrcgistriition. My problem was a
complex one concerning the fact that l atn a
iranslcr st tidcnt and amjiisi one credit short of
pit-registering in a higher classification
(.ltitlttit‘ instead lll Sophomore). liccausc | atn
a ittinstcr student and am also changing ina—
jots. 1 tone only live semesters tocoiiipletc my
major's requirements instead of the usual
eight.

After explaining this problem to the
secretary I encountered. l rioticcd a look on
her lace which conveyed to me a feeling that l
was somehow imposing on her time. She was
not It] any any concerned with myspectfic per-
sonal problem. she just continued to tell me
what I could and cotild not do. 'l hree times.l
politely asked to talk wrtlt someone else. and
\\ lien I finally did. he also proceeded to tell me.
Ill an impersonal manner. that it was just
tough luck.

llic exponential growth of bureaucracy in
this country is a very serious problem that
allecls millions ol people. When people are
treated like impersonal objects aitd are not
giten individual attention and consideration.
it is a sure sign that something is wrong with
the system. My experience with the registrar is
bureaucratic bullshit at its best.

For The Sake Of Justice f

After much ado, former Class of .‘78 President Marc Benécke may '
receive no more punishment for a $3,000 theft than a student who is forcé
ed to leave school for lack of academic achievement. This is gross inequi-
ty. »

The formula at work is simple. If a student fails to accumulate a re-' .
quired number of credits, he or she is banished from SUNYA. Similarly, -
if a student fails to successfully cover-up a $3,000 theft, he or she is also
banned from SUNYA's classrooms. * -

The inequity here lies in the fact that supposedly equal punishments '
are being doled out for obviously unequal crimes—if academic failure
can even be thought of as a crime.

When students are “graduated early” because they lack in the required
number of credits, as usually because they’re either incapable of keep-
ing up with the workload or incapable ofcaring. Neither ofthese actions
are criminal. However, the law has a ready-made label for the theft of
$3,000—grand larceny.

One could argue—but not for long—that Beneckc’s punishment was
harsher than the one that might be leveled on the failingstudent. After
all, Benccke was not only suspended from school but ordered to con-
currently pay back the $3,000 he stole. The smart crook would have in-
vested the three grand and reaped benefits from it while taking 15
months to pay it off. in this sense, Benecke committed a more serious
crime than the hypothetical academic invalid, and received a lesser
punishment, since part of his retribution‘included a $3,000 interest-free
loan.

Suspension from school has already proven itself an ineffective
deterrent. A student may be suspended for cheating, yet cheating at
SUNYA is a commonplace occurancc. Handing out slaps on the wrist
for more serious offenses can only increase their frequency.

The Committee for Student Conduct secretly tried' and sentenced
Benccke. But his story was never revealed to the students, who have been
left with no means by which to judge for themselves his innocence or
guilt. And it is certainly not clear that the punishment fits the crime.

It appears that the Committee for Student Conduct will pursue the
matter no further. That’s their prerogative. However, they are not the
victims—the students of the Class of ’78 and all other SUNYA students
are.

For the sake of present students, future students, and for the sake of
justice, Benecke should be brought to court for a fair trial, so the whole
story will be told and an equitable settlement reached.
