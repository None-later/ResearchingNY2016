BUFFALO (AP) Getting kicked out ‘
of his mom National Football

league game didn‘t frustrate OJ.

Simpson. the Buffalo Bills' super
running back said.

“But what bothers me. it frustrates
me. is beingin the leagueeight years
and we‘re two or three years away
from a Super Bowl.“ he said
Wednesday. ‘

Simpson also had some
"frustrations" last summer. when he
asked Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson
to trade him to a West Coast team.
preferably the Los Angeles Rams.

Wilson could not make atradefor
the top-notch players he wanted and
convinced Simpson to return to Bul-
l'alo on the eve of the Bills‘ season-
openen

“Sure. I‘d do it again." Simpson-
said. referring to his trade request
and missing the Bill‘s preseason.
“But now it's all behind me."

“I don‘t know.“ Simpson
answered when asked whether this
would be his last season in football.
"I'm not even goingto think about it
now. or after the season ends.“

Simpson. who is growing a beard
“just l'orthe hell ot'it... I‘ll shave it off
Christmas.“ will play the pan of an
astronaut in the movie “Capricorn.
One.“ scheduled to go into produc-
tion Jan. 3 in Los Angeles. his home
city.

     
 

 

    
 

   

 

"Right now. I'm playing football.
I'm trying to keep my body in shape
for the rest of the season." he said.

Then. back to talking about Sun~
day light. Simpson said he had been
in three incidents last season when“l
took late hits.“

S.l\Ll‘thl

 

“If I get hit late. I get up and shove
or something.” he‘ said.

"I don't believe in fighting, but I
want to let the guy know.

“But that the Sunday ﬁght was the
first time it‘s happened to me. It ain't
bothering me none.“

 

 

TAKE ONE
ASP at a time, please!
There's really not enough to go around V everybody took a
handful at a time. Sure. they're/rec. but if they run out. some
people won't get one.
