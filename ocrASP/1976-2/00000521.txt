ISTANBUL,Turkey(AP)Thecom-
ing ofthe supermarket agetoTurkey
is dimming a joyous aspect of orien-
tal life—bargaining with everybody
who has something to sell.

Shoppers used to flock to
cobblcstoncd Mahmutpnshu Street.
gateway to the loth century grand
bazaar. whose 750 stores offered
everything from bras and blankets
for brides. to pots and pans and
prayer rugs.

But profits on this street have
plummeted almost 40 per cent in the
past two years. sellers say. as once-
l‘ailhl'ul customers no longer venture
into lstunbul's chaotic traffic from
the suburbs.

"They will almost certainly wreck
what is left of the old lstanbul."
lamented a shop owner ina nostalgic
recollection of the “golden years."

“We miss the good-mannered
buyers who knew the game."

In a typical present-day scene in
the grand bazaar. for years the only
shopping area catering to low-
incomc groups, a heated argument is
waged over the price of a set of
blankets for a bride.

‘l‘hc weary-looking seller asks 500
liras. about $35. but the woman
counters with an offer of half that.
Unable to compromise. shc im-
mediately drags her daughter out of
the dome-shaped shop and knowing-
ly consoles her:

“Don‘t worry. we‘ll get it at that
price.“ But in another store.

Most likely they headed to the

Supermarkets ‘RepldCing ' iv
Old Turkish Bazaar Shops

 

nearest. supermarket, department
store or “organiied market,” here
they feel they will not be pushed
about by an intriguing seller or dis-
turbed by the cacophony of bargain-
ing.

Screams of water vendors clad in
white overcoats and tinkling their
tanks and performers of ' other
sidewalk arts are also absent from
such scenes.

A spokesman for the UFI. a
supermarket chain. explained:

“The housewife is tired of oriental
modes of shopping and looks for
tnorc organilcd and centralized
places to buy her nccds~4and at
cheaper prices.“

Ersin Kermen. 34, fluent in
English and French. said that by
direct purchasing from manufac-
turers. the establishment has
adopted a heavily advertised policy
of “cheap but good products,"
represented by the initials of UFI.

Kermcn said 8.000 persons, most-
ly housewives. visit the store each
chk.

UH. which opened only last
November, says it has doubled its
volume and upped profits 25 per cent
in recent months.

Despite all the plus signs for the
new trade. surveys conducted by
private experts concluded that many
buyers tend to question the quality
ot products t bat carry low price tags.

"That is an inherent malady oi the
'lurkish customer‘s way of think-
ing.“ said Kcrmcn.

World Population Won’t
Double by Turn of Century

UNITED NATIONS. N.Y. (AP)
Falling birth rates and unforeseen
deaths from hunger have slowed
global population growth to the
point where a doubling of world
population by the year 2000 is no
longer anticipated. according to the
Worldwatch Rescurclt institute.

I'accd by two of the world's four
most populous countries. China and
the United States. population
growth has decreased in rich and
poor countries alike. reversing for
the first time in history it trend of
gradually nccclcrnting growth. the
Worldwutch study adds.

The Worldwutch Research In-
stitutt. is based in Washington and is
funded in purl by tile United
Nations. [is puposc is to study
cnvimoment-related problems in the
world.

Growth Drops

l)r. Lester Brown. till agricultural
economist who heads the institute.
says in the report released here
'I'hursduy that the decline in popula-
tion growth reflects more than
anything else. the widening
nvnilubility of family planning scr-
vices. including both abortion and
contraception. and it growing desire
to use them.

liy early 1970, ()4 per cent of the
would's people lived in countries
where abortions were legal, up from
38 per cent in I971. the reportunys.

But in some of the poorest coun-
tries, such as indin and Bangladesh.
food shortages have pushed up death
rates, resulting in millions of “ad-
ditionul and avoidable" deaths over
the past five years. according to the
report.

NOVEMBER 16, 1976

The study shows that the rate of
world population growth reached an
all-time high about the beginning of
this dccndc and then began to sub-
side. '

in I970, lhc number of humans
grew by an estimated [.9 per cent on-
nually. or fi‘) million based on the
world population of 3.59 billion. The
most recent data show a marked
decline since then to LM per cent in
I975 64 million out M192 billion.

The slowing of population growth
was concentrated in three regions
We. ' "uropc, North America
and East Asia. ’l he growth rate fell
by almost one-half in Western Eu-
rope ilntl by a third in North
America and iinst Asia.

ihc few countries [but still have
rising birth rates are mostly in
linslcrn Europe where the
governments recently adopted
policies encouraging births, and
reversed the long standing decline in
population growth.

The dramatic drop in the birth
rate of China from 1.85 per ccnl in
W70 to l. Ili per cent in l975 was the
most rapid ofnny country on record.
the ref u't says. China‘s current pop-
ulation was estimated by the in-
stitute to the around 823 million. a
fifth of the world's population.

llrown says China's performance
should come as no surprise: the com-
prehensive Chincss effort focuses
not only on increasing fumin plan-
ning services. including abortion.
but also on reshaping economic and
social policies to encourage small
families. and on an intensive public
education campaign extolling the
beneﬁts of smaller families.
