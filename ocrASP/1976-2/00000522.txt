US. Government Proposes 

Wine Label Regulations

WASHINGTON (AP) The govern-
ment proposed labeling regulations
that would provide buyers
of U.S. wines with information
abottt a wine‘s origin similar to that
provided to buyers of European vin-
tagcs.

in addition to stricter definitions
on which wines can be labeled as
derived from acertain vintage. grape
or region. the government proposed
a separate designation intended to
provide even more stringent
assurances.

The proposals offered by the
Treasury Department‘s Bureau of
Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms are
scheduled for hearings Dec. 13
through 15 in San Francisco and
Jan. il in Washington.

The new regulations would

replace what government officials
concede is a confusing set of direc—
tives. These regulations permit wines
to be designated as being from a par-
ticular grape and rcgionevcnthough
the wine contains as little as 26 per
cent from that source. “Many con-
sumers judge the United States to
produce some of the world‘s best
wine.“ said A'l'F Director Rex D.
Davis.

“We believe our proposals can
serve tocnhance this reputation both
here and abroad." The' new
regulations generally would not re-
quire label changes in foreign wines
as long as they comply with national
labeling regulations.
