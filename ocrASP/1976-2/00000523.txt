SONGFUL LOBBYING

England‘s Independent Broad-
casting Authority has banned from
the airwaves a hit record by Peter
Tosh which advocates the legaliza-
tion of marijuana.

In a letter to all of Britain's in-
dependent radio stations. the
authority charged that the record.
titled “Legalize It“. is unfit for radio
play because it advocates a change in
existing laws relating to marijuana.

The authority has ruled that
Tosh's record may be advertised on
the air. but only if its title and lyrics
are deleted from all the ads.

REGENERATION

The coroner‘s office in Berkeley.
California. reports that the brain of a
l5-ycar-old murder victim has been
turned over to a private company
which plans. in the deputy coroner‘s
words. “To bring her brick to life.“

Coroner‘s investigator John Har-
din says that the Herkeley Company.
'I'rrins ‘l‘ime incorporated. claimed
the brain of Patricia Wilson. it IS-
year-old girl who was beaten to
death during a robbery last weekend.

'i'rans Time is a cryogenic
organiration which offers the service
of freezing people after death in
hopes that doctors of the future
could cure what a person died front
and tlteri bring them back to life.

The company reportedly believes
that science one day may have the
ability to take a few cells from a
preserved organ. such as the brain.
and regenerate these into a complete
living individual.

ISLAND FETUS

United States are reportedly cont-

pcctcd to rise lrom the Pacific
Ocean.

never existed. but sonar readings by
both the Japanese and the
Americttns have detected an island
that has risen two miles from the
ocean bottom and is now very near
the surface.

According the Japan‘s Maritime
Safety Agency. the island and fishing
rights around it will belong to
whoever sights it first. Ships from
both nations are said to have stepped
up their watch for the expected birth
of the island. which is located about
700 miles south of Tokyo.

IMMORTALITY

A Stanford University radio
astronomer is predicting that
humans on the Earth will some day
learn the secrets of immortality by

$,ALHRSI

According to the I.er Ange/av
I'intei. Americans spent SlitlU
million last yetir on gum. and cori-
sumcd about 200 sticks for each
man. woman and child irt America.

4 Some of tire more recent attempts
to cash in on the gum market include
cclery-llavored gum for health nuts;
a nicotine gain to replace the
cigarette habit; and overt a Japanese-
made chewing gum for dogs. All of
them. The liliit‘a’ says. have failed.

DOGGIE DIET

The Ralston Purina Company
reports it will soon begin marketing
a low-caloric food for dogs.

The dry-food product. to becalled
"Fit and Trim“. is being designed
specially. in Ralston Purina‘s words.
“For the overweight and inactive
adttlt dog."

The product should find a ripe
market: a recent US survey found
that 4| per cent of all dog owners
believed their pooches are
overweight. and 62 per cent describ-
ed their pets as “inactivc house
dogs.“ Americans are already spen-
ding $l.8 billion ayearon dog food.

VALUED VIOLENCE

Violence in the United States is
useful. arid most people accept it as
necessary to "Maintain social con—
trol."

'l'hat‘s the cortelusion of a recently
completed study frorri the University
ol Michigan's Institute for Social
Research. The study" which polled

_ personal _
_ r ins about-09ml

Another ten' percent . “
questioned ,said they thought that
“Extensive property damage and
some deaths? were needed for social
control. The researchers say their
studies also show that many more
low-income people viewed violence
as necessary than those with incomes
of,over “5.000. '

Accordingto Marcia Blumenthel.
the director of the studies. the lSR
study indicates people label
"violence" in different ways. In a
most recent sampling. over half the
men thought burning a draft card
was a violent act. while 53 percent
said shooting looters was not
violent.

PILL-HARMFUL!

Yet another danger has been link-
ed to birth control pills.

A New York heart and blood
specialist is warningthat one inevery
20 women who take birth control
pills is in danger of developing high
blood pressure.

Doctor John Laragh. of The New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center. reports that high blood
pressure induced by oral
contraceptives—which once was
thought to be occurring only in ex-
tremely rare cases-—is in fact “Ex-
tremely Common."

Writing in The Journal of
Ohslelrica‘ and Gynecology. Laragb
urges physicians and gynecologists
not to prescribe the pill to women
with a history of high blood pressure
or other cardiovascular diseases.
