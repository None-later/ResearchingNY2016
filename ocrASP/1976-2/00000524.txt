Marijuana reform is again being discussed.

persorls. many of whom. were ﬁrst time
offenders. '

- Aside from the personal tragedy. taxpayers
shelled out over 30 million dollars in police
salaries. administrative expenses. and court
costs. In addition. law offices were diverted
from more important work to chase young
persons possessing one or two joints.

Last year. Governor Carey proposed a
measure that would decriminalize possession
of up to tWo ounces of marijuana. State Senate
Republicans led by majority leader Warren
Anderson attacked the proposal. Senator
Anderson claimed that it would lead to

campus pot dealerships. Assembly Democrats.

supported reform. but did little to pressure
their Senate colleagues. In the end. marijuana

nothing controversial. ‘

new opportunities for reform. As a result of

Bill Likely -

by Donald 
last year's lobbying activities many leg'glgton

have been convinced that use of moderate ,

amounts of marijuana poses no public health
or safety hazard. New government studies but-
tress this position. It legislation is brought up
early in the session. its chance of passage
seems good.

Unfortunately. the leg‘slation is unlikely to ‘
go as far as most reformers would wish.
Decriml'nalization for possession of _two
ounces or less of marijuana is the goal of most
reformers. It will be very difficult to move
senate Republicans this far. A one ounce bill is
more likely.

It will be even harder to persuade them to
change the legal definition of “sale” which now

dumps casual passage of asinglejoint intotbe -

same category as an exchange of marijuana
for profit.

Chances for a good law would be increased
if the Senators felt a movement for reform
back in their home district. At the state level.
letters from a few constituents often can make
a real difference. Students who believe that
decriminalization is necessz should write
their legislators as soon as possible and urge

that course of action. The greater the outcry I

for reform. the more likely it will be that a
good dccriminalization bill passes this
semester.

It should
be there

To the Editor: _
It seems to be that time of the semester again
when everone has one or more papers to do;
and in the attempt to polish our scholarly
writings. many of us come to rely on the
abundant resources ofthc University Library.
I say “abundant” with a certain degree of sar-
casm. Certainly. the material listed in the
catalogues is bona-fide. but one may then ask
the question.“lf they are here. then why are
they so elusive?“ .
When asking Library personnel this ques-
tion, they retort with the statement that the
material “should be there". The plain fact is
that much of the rims it is not; and when the
material is locatable. much of it has been
destroyed by students who are either too lazy.
or more likely too cheap to make a copy.
With the whole University undergoing
ﬁnancial retrenchment. the axe has not evaded
the library. Hours have been cut‘. as well as
staff and funds for new books. With allthis.
how can the library be expected to keep up
with the unquantifyable amount of damage
that has been occurring!
The library situation is only one example;

amine is one of a cold feeling of insensitivity
that has become all to pervasive among
students at SUNYA.

By students. i am referring toth'ose who let
an internal force drivcthem. like ajuggernaut.

who grab everything for themselves. leaving
the rest of us without even a paddle. What

Lsatiable desire for knowledge. but the notable

Bourgeoisie vs. Workers

by Tom Scherbenlto .

What happened in China“? A lot of self-
proclaimcd experts are handing us it lot of
"answers" these days. but almost all of them
have one main ﬂaw: they represent the view-
point ot' pcoplc livitlg under it capitlllistic
ccotlomic systcm China's ccotlomic system
is socialist. _

So. talk about “moderated” and "radicals"
nnd "power struggles“ loses its meaning. This
deception is easily carried off, its few of Us
hilvc sccn. much lcss participated in. the
Chinese socialist society. Most of us would
find it hard to imagine the totally different
social system. so we rcadily accept the applica-
tion of terms we use freely hcrc.

'I'hcrc have hccn Americans who lived in
China for a while. and many (including
myself) who have visited there. From these
people we can gtlin some insight. though it is
still about its difficult as imagining a four-
dimcnsionill society.

Let‘s look ill the idcn of it “pchr struggle“
to bcgill with. What docs it usually mean here?
We don‘t see too much of it in our country.
because Wc have it "democracy". It's more
often applied to military regimes. countries
whcrc lllc popullltion has little stly in lllc
government. Our concept of a "power
struggle" does not lllvolvc feelings oftlle peo-
plc usually its it tight hclwecn two forces
who want to control the people.

So. when we tillk of it “power struggle" in
China. we immediately assume it luck of
democracy. And wlly not? Isn‘t that just what
we've been told all our lives?

Strangely enough. in China. workers on a
commune democratically decide on the issues
normally handled by “management.” The
same is true of factories. hospitals. day care
centers. etc. Decisions tire made by those peo-
ple whose work keeps the. place going.
Managers exist. but mostlytocoordinate.anrl
they must do their share of the work. And, an
increasing amount of workers are learning to
manage.

Doesn‘t it seem strange that in a land \vhclc
democracy exists on such pervasch lc\cl\. lllc
actual government would be sonic sort ol div»
tatorship’.’

ficers are allowed to use guns as a daily and
nightly tool of their work. the presence of this
armed force may be enough to cause more
than a hint of paranoia on campus. Every stu-
dent whose life is centered at this university
has a personal stake in this gun issue.

Do you think that the campus security men
and women should be legally empowered to
carry pistols. revolvers. or anysimilar weapon
hereon our campus? Do you see it as a moral
issue or an unimportant one?

Central Council has been accused of doing
nothing about anything. Central Council is in
need of goals. or one goal that can motivate a
symbolic showing of studentpower. If you see
the gun issue as being important we could do
something There is a meeting in the Campus
Center (it should be called Student Union)
Room number 370 at l22l5 on Wednesday.
Nov. l7. At this meeting. if you come to it you
will hear all the reasons for a militia on cam-
pus. That rhetoric is similar to the rhetoric we
have heard about departments being cut.

Please be aware that we students do have a
voice in the decision-making at this university.
In the past. students have only become
angered when things got bad enough. I see the
gun issue as a direct threat to every student
here; not only a threat to their physical lives
but also to their right to get what they want on
this campus. We are paying to be here.

Anyway. my perceptions are here for you to
read. Do with them what you will —— I‘ll be at
the meeting on Nov. l7.

Space Computations . , v ;   '

The main entrance to the Computing Center is flanked by two lounge
couches. These couches are often the scene of program “debugging.” a
type of computer work done by students. Many times. this study space is
inadequate for students examining large-page printoutssince there is no
place to‘ rest the sheets; no place to leave a pencil ora text. The student
programmer sinks into a. comfortable but floundering chaise-lounge
position trying to complete an assignment.

During peak periods, the crowd mushrooms. Overﬂow into the main
corridor blocks traffic; books, bags, coats and bodies obstruct the
entranceway, creating a fire hazard. ‘

The administration of the Computing Center points out that the
couches are a compromise between the demands of working students
and space shortages. A proposed solution: ten study carrels with chairs
Would certainly make use of the space more efficient. and clear the
center's main entrance for traffic in and out. ' I

More effective would be a nearby room with tables and furnishings
sufficient to handle the workload. (The Univac “10 ran an average of
1900 computer programs each day of October last year; on a normal day
the Computing Center hosts more people per-square-foot than the
library.) But it isn‘t clear that such a room is available.

Space shortage at SUNYA has long been a problem. The academic
podium was originally designed with six more buildings than were
finally constructed, three at each end. However. the planned extensions
were hacked off, followed by the death of two multi-level parking
structures. People at SUNYA realized then there wouldn't be any great
wealth of on—campus ﬂoorspace available. And it looks like the situation
is not about to improve.

The people of the tiny Netherlands. with their land-claiming dikes.
reﬂect a space-conciousness which SUNYA would be wise to begrasp.
When there is little space available, then a little space must be used
wisely.

Damn it. I thought. Carter did it already and he's not even in office yet.
