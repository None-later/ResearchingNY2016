jazz-rock artist for more than a decade. Recently, he is noted for his
LP “Breezt‘n.” one of the largest selling jazz albums in history. If
you've heard his hit single "This Marquerade"then you know Benson
has a light. tasteful approach that’s hard to tire of. However, his
albums show that he can really cook on guitar. without losing his
light touch. Not surprisingly, Benson's achievements have won him
the Playboy All-Star Poll, a Grammy nomination, and the long-
standing support of a loyal following. But this acclaim is meaningless

without Benson's music to back it_up. .

Are Blacks Considered
Human Beings:

A'Simple Question?

by Judy Ricardo

Are Blacks considered human beings? To
those who seek a reason for the origins of this
question, i will offer a brief explanation.
Many times in the field of education we ﬁnd
signiﬁcance in proposing a simple trite ques-
tion about alsubject that is taken for granted.
Through this process. many of the marvelous
inventions that mark our time have been
developed. This method. also. is a genuinely
accurate method of testing reality. The ques-
tion “Are Blacks considered human
being?" may seem petty at first. but if we
truly consider what we are asking, we may
come up with some startling discoveries about
ourselves.

Better grounds for this question are found
in the way administrators, . politicians.
businessmen and government officials handle
the “Black l’roblem“. Whether it be a com-
pany‘s decision to develop a prospective
market in the Black Community or a
politician's concern for a block of Black voters
that could win or cost him the election. Blacks
are continuously being treated as a cohesive
group with certaintraits whocan be taken care
of with specific acceptable procedures and lit-
tle regard for their bumanness. Real estate
sales and long range economic planning are
good examples of this. (Some entrepenuers

purposely seek exclusivity in the development
of their markets.)
Whites of all ethnic backgrounds are treated

7 equally. Unless they choose to make a point of

their cultural differences. all whites. whether
they be French or Jewish. are accepted in most
of the activity situations they find themselves
in. One such situation is the classroom. Many
Blacks often speak of a certain quintessismal
uneasiness in class. and hence fail to produce.
Also. a white person (of any ethnic
background) would probably find it very easy
to travel to most places in the United States
and can casually take place in a wide range of
social. economic. political and religious ac-
tivities. Most Blacks. excluding very extreme
tnalattos. would meet disaster if attemptingto
do the same.

The main reason the question has been pos-
ed is the generally accepted way human beings
treateach other 4 your mother. your girlfriend
or boyfriend. or a fellow voyager on a long
trip. It is understnadzible that we do not treat
everyone the same. llut when the treatment
given to Blacks is at such a low quality and
quantity that it has traumatic effects. we must
ask ourselves, “Ate Blacks considered human
beittgs‘l". Until all opportunities open to
human beings are open to Blacks as well. we
cannot truthfully answer yes.

CC Keeps Same Hours

Following are excerpts from the
Straightlinc show on WSUA 640AM. Hos!
Dan Gaines spoke Io Alice C orbt’rt, Director
ql'lhe Campus Cenler.

Gaines: Why isn‘t the Campus Center open
latcr'.’

Corbin: I suppose the Campus Center staff
asks: How much later? For whom? At what
cost?

Gaines: Has it ever been open later than it is
now?

Corbin: On an experimental basis. a few years
back we did try to stay open I think to two or
three o‘clock in the morning. It was clearly an
experiment. fairly well-monitored as I recall.
The question was: 'is it worth it'." and ‘is it
wonh it for how many‘!‘ And the buildingstaff
at the time did take attendance. if you will. on
how many people were really using the place.
We went back to closing at one o‘clock on Fri-
day and Saturday night.

Gaines: Now that the Rnthskeller can be
sealed off from the rest of the building. , .if
they wanted to stay open another hour or two

Luau-nu".- "nu"..-

or three. it wouldn't have a serious effect on
the rest of the building.

Corbin: It shouldn't affect it. About keeping
the Campus Center open. one expense. which
is, I think.an enigmato most college unions is:
if you don‘t shut it down at some point and
have thccapabilitics ofclcaning it. theexpense
is going to be some deterioration of the
physical plant . . . at least in this Campus
Center. it seemed to be very difficult to do a
very good job of cleaning unless the building
was pretty much deviod of people. For in_-
stance. if a ballroom party has been approved
as going beyond building hours. our night
crew has adifficult time. Well.why’!They find
that they‘ve cleaned the third floor. (the people
didn‘t stay in the ballroom for the party). if
you will-—sometimes they run around the
third floor. And the crew is faced with a
recleaning situation. Either that or a com-
plaint the following morning saying "Why
didn't you clean it?“

Gaines: Could you use a fourth ﬂoor?
Corbin: Yes. Maybe a fifth.
