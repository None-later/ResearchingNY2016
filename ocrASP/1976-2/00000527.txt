Helmrich or Ms. Newman is yet

and marvelous musicinanship
promise a great future for them both.

A majority of the program con-
sisted of Mr. Helmrich as a solo ar-
tist. whose career to this date has
consisted of collaborating with
singers on the one hand (he is the
head vocal coach of the Berkshire
Music Center 'at Tanglewood) and of
performing contemporary American
music on the other. In what was
perhaps an attempt to move away
from the stereotype. Mr. Helmrich‘s
program contained only one recent
American composition. “A Sonata
for Piano" by R. Cuckson. The rest
of the program spanned the gamut
from Mozart thru Liszt to Dukas.
during which certain aspects of Mr.
Helmrich's musical "personality"
came shining through.

The Mozart piece which Mr.
Helmrich began with. was a highly
romantic one for this most classic of
composers. the Fantasy and Fugue

Y uses a standard classical form. but

through a heavy emphasis on [discord

fond. cromatlcism he seems to be

reaching for or even going past the
early romantacism of Beethoven.

Mr. Helmrich dwelled perhaps
too long on those passages which af-
forded him the opportunity to dis-
play his virtuostic abilities. Much the
same criticism applies to his perfor-
mance of the Minuet in D (K.576b).
To be sure. it also has its "romantic"
elements. Yet. it is difficult to hear it
as overwhelmingly romantic as it
was played. Of all the Mozart
played. the performance of the
Variations on “Unser dummer Pobel
meint" (K455) captured a truly
classical spirit best. The music has a
great deal of rollicking good humour
in it which was brought out extreme-
ly well.

What made the shortcomings of
the Mozart at alldistinguishable was
the performance Mr. Helmrich gave
to his ﬁnal numbers: a Sonata for
piano by Cuckson. the Allegro
moderato from the sonata by Dukas.
and the Fantasy on the Quartet from
Verdi's Riga/mo by Liszt. The one
common factor they have is the

demand from the performer.

in style, however. they all differ
widely. Where the Cuckson seemed
to be a deliberate recalling of the late
romantic musical tradition with cer-
tain very modern elements, the
movement from Dukas' sonata is
music which is just moving away
from those same traditions.

0t all the pieces. Mr. Helmrich
seemed to be completely at home in
his performance of the great roman-
tic composer Franz Liszt. At heart.
he seems to be inclined to be more
comfortable with the type of piece in
which he can bring his full arsenal of
technique and emotion to bear in his
interpretations.

Overall. each piece seemed to con-
sist of numerous “perpetual motion"
themes to which. if an adjective
applies to one. it applies to them all.
H is interpretations were rich. varied.
and constantly refreshing. If the
Mozart had been slightly disappoin-
ting. these pieces made up for lost
ground.

The vocal section of the concert
consisted of seven “Gedichte” or
"Poem" by M'edtner. performed by
Ms. Newman. Ms. Newman. like
Mr. Helmrich, is a young and rising
musical talent with an extensive

This past weekend. Paula

to SUNYA performing at the
Freeze-Dried Coffee House on Fri-
day and Saturday nights.

The group. billed as “30.5-40'5
blues and swing." surprisingly did
relatively few blues and swing
numbers in the first half of the per-
formance. relying more onearly thir~
ties “dinner-type music." with an oc-
casional number from the rock and
roll era.

After opining with a blues-
oriented piece. the group followed
with an old 30‘s tune with amusing
lyrics:

You'd better accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative

Latch on to the affirmative

Don't mess with Mr. In-be/ween... "

Next were a couple of more con-
temporary pieces, after which the
group suddenly burst into a rock and
roll song called “Flip. Flop or Fly."
written by Joe Turner. and originally
performed by .lcrry Lee Lewis. This

selection drew tt strong. loud
I applause from the audience. Includ-
ed in the set were ll couple of
numbers by Hank Willittnts. l'he
mttted trumpet in “Honky 'l'onk
lllucs" gttvc the impression that the
group. and even the song itself. was
poking fun at the blues. “Mimi Your
Own Business." was the other Hunk
, Williams song.
In the second half of the perfor-
Itilitllcc. though Paula and (‘o. did it
’littlc more blues. it was still tinl

Kent was adequate but too. domi-

The band performed a couple of
fine jazz instrumentals while Paula
took a rest. includinga piano solo by
Bob Montalto. Playing by
themselves. the band was very good.
It‘s a shame they didn’t mix better
with Paula‘s singing.

Paula claims to be greatly in-
ﬂuenced by old styles. performingas
she says. “country swing. a lot of
blues. old rhythm and blues. ballads.
