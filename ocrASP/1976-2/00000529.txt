usually good for only a few yards.

Giants Win First of Season

EAST RUTHERFORD. N..l. (AP)
The season-long losing streak ended
as it had started. in the final minute
against the Washington Redskins.
and when it was finally over. New
York Giant Coach John McVay had
to salute his defense.

They were magnificent." said Me-
Vay after the Giants had jolted the
Redskins‘ National Football League
playoff hopes with a shocking l2-9
victory Sunday.

“They are a gutty bunclt of guys.
getting stepped on and pushed
around. but still believing in each
other." McVay said.

The victory was constructed on
four field goals by Joe Danclo. the
final one a 50-yarder with 4:32 left to
play. Three of Danclo‘s kicks came
alter Washington turnovers forced

by an aggressive Giant defense which
has not allowed a touchdown in its
last l0 quarters.

Danelo. who had kicked only
three ﬁeld goals all season. also hit
from 30. 26 and 39 yards. missing
only on a 53-yard try. Washington‘s
Mark Moseley kicked field goals
from 4|. 3| and 32 but missed three
other tries. twice from 46 yards and
once from 49.

Winning Drive

The Giants‘ winning drive was
launched when linebacker Harry
Carson shook the bull loose from
Mike Thomas at New York's 27-
yard line. early in the fourth quarter.
Quarterback Norm Snead. who
completed only three passes all day.
that moved New York to the
Washington 33 and ate up almost

eight minutes on the clock. Then
Danelo kicked the field goal to put
the Giants on top.

The victory ended a record string
of nine straight losses for- the Giants.
a streak that started in the season-
opencr when the Redskins came
from behind for a l9-l7 victory in
the ﬁnal seconds. | t also marked the
first time New York has beaten a
George Allen-coached team after l4
consecutive losses 7 ~ II to
Washington and three to Los
Angeles when Allen was there.

“This is a bitter blow." siad Allen.
whose team‘s playoff hopes had
brightened when the Redskins
kayoed San Francisco last week. “I
feel it was a lack of concentration.
Everytimc we win a big game. we let
down the next week."

tion. Galea described Palkovic as
durable and thinks he should do well
during the season. '

The l58 class has two freshmen:
Steve Kori and Mike Williamson.
Both were named most valuable
wrestlers at their high schools.

The next class ( I67) is perhaps the
weakest. according to Galea. The
only wrestler right now is Jeff
Aronowitz. Galea hopes they will ac-
quire another wrestler from the foot-
ball team once their season is over.

At I77 are Dave Clark. a
freshman. and Dave Mathis.

Four wrestlers occupy the I90
class. They are Earl Johnson. Chris
Kovis. Ted Davis and Steve
Lawrence. Galea believes this class
will be tough.

Galea feels conﬁdent that the
squad will be in good shapel‘or the
start of the season; Coach Joe Garcia
however. is a little worried about the
heavyweights. “Many of our
heavyweights are playing football
now and when their season ends.
they‘ll need a week to rest before they
can start to wrestle.”

The ﬁrst match of the season Is at

‘home on December 8. it‘s a

The team is looking for people to

Anyone interested. male or female.
should contact either coach Garcia
or Assistant Coach Galea at the un-
