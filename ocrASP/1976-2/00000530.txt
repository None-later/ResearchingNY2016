For the' Great Danes'and the
Springﬁeld Chiefs, Saturday's finsl'

I976 football game at University
Field‘marlted the end of an era. For
Albany. it was the end of a winning
one: for Springﬁeld. itterminated a
losing one. ' ' '
The,Chiefs had just handed the
Danes a 2M drubbing to give them a
5-4 record—their ﬁrst winning
season since l970. Albany.
meanwhile. fell to 4-5 and suffered
its ﬁrst losing season since gaining
varsity status in I973. ‘ .
“You've got to give Springﬁeld
credit." a disconsolate Albany coach
Robert Ford said after the game.
“They did what they had to do."
What they did was capitalize on
the Albany mistakes and score when
the opportunity presented itself.
Albany did not. and paid the price.
Springﬁeld struck quickly and
early in the game. and in doing so. set
the tone for the remainder of the
contest. With three minutes gone in
the ﬁrst quarter. Albany‘s Mike

Martin punted the bail down to the
Springﬁeld l4 yard line. Deepback
Bob Gross mat the reception and
then proceeded to streak all the way
downﬁ'eld for an 86-yard touchdown

run to put the visitors out in front..

Guy Swiatlowski’s extra point'kiclt
was good and instantly. the Chiefs
led 7-0.' ’

It was all they needed. Both teams
found the going tough for the next
few series and were unable to make
any semblance of a sustained drive.
The ﬁeld conditions played a major
part in that respect. not giving the
runners much of a chance to get
footing. By the end of the contest.
the muddy turfand spike marks had

Coach Ford felt the field con-
ditions hurt his squad considerably

for size. When we don't get 'it

Grapplers Open Soon

by Eddie Emerman

After a disappointing season last
year. the Albany State wrestling'
team is looking for a turnaround
with the help of newcomers this year.

“We are hoping for strong perfor-

mances from a group of freshmen.
all with real good backgrounds."
said assistant coach Joe Galea. Thir-
teen freshmen have made the squad
this year; seven of them received high
school awards as outstanding
wrestlers and all Were team captains.

Lack of depth was a problem for
the Danes last year. The team was
plagued by injuries throughout the
year and this was a main factor in
their disappointing season.

The team appears to be more solid
this year. according to Cities. “We
have increased our depth tremen-
dously. We're a little weak at the
middleweight levels but are very
strong at the light and upperWeight
levels. We are hoping this will make
up for the difference."

The Danes lost only one wrestler

This year's captain is Vic Gagliar-

' Booters Lose To Binghamton

by Ed Moser

To the end ll remained a season of
hard luck for the Albany State
soccer team. On Saturday the
Booters were eliminated from the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Con-

ference tournament as they bowed to

Binghamton in overtime, 3-2.

A goal by Binghamton's Jose
Ramirez at 2:35 of sudden death
followed a second half in which
Albany failed to connect on several
good scoring chances.

The Bootch drew first blood some
23 minutes into the first half when
Chep Ruano. on a pass from Johnny
Rolando. chipped a ﬁve yarder past
the Binghamton goalie.

A second Rolando assist set up the
next Albany point. With time run-
ning down in the first half, Rolando

took a throw-in from Ricardo Rose
and deftly knocked the ball across
the goalmouth to a waiting Carlos
Arango, who headed it in with but
six seconds remaining.

A Ramirez goal sandwiched
between the two Albany tallies ac-
counted for the 2-l halftime score.
Later a controversial call set up a
Bingamton goal ten minutes into the
second half.

As a Binghamton player streaked
with the ball towards the Booter
goal. Albany‘s Mark Wench pulled
alongside him and was called for
pushing. Albany disagreed. claiming
Wenzel had merely run parallel to
his opponent. “He bumped me."
stated Wenzel ﬁatly.

In any event the call stood. and it
led to a direct kick which ricocheted

off the Albany defensive screen. In
the resulting melee. a kick deflected
off Albany‘s Stan Gage and into the
goal.

The rest of the second half proved
that soccer is as much a game of
breaks and ‘inches‘ as any other
sport. '

Albany‘s Frank Selca and Carlos
Arungo both had breakaway shots.
and both were denied. Binghamton
goalmindcr Tim Sheridan position-
ed himclf well to cut down Sclca‘s
shooting angle. and managed to
steer the Bootcr‘s blast out of
bounds. Arango. slipping on the
frozen playing surface. could not lift
his off-balance shot over the goalie.
A third Albany attempt was
deflected away right at the goallinc.

Landlord Apologized

One of the owners of 48A Dove Street. Michael Rickmun. has
previously publicly apologized for rental dealings connected with that

On Sept. 7 of this year. Rickmun bought an advertisement in the
Albany Student Press in which he said “The following apology is to
[four students] for all the hassles caused by my unprof'csxional manner
in handling the rental of 48A Dove St.“

The apology was for the general disorder of the building at the
beginning of the semester. according to one of the four students. The
student said Rickmun had been unable to meet the deadline for
rehabilitating the building due to injuries that he had suffered in a May
fire at a building at htlo Madison Ave.. which he also owned.

"He tried to be nice but he over—extended himself.“ the studentsuid.
Another of the four students said. “You‘re not going to get any good

been released.

Polk. Deutschman. Le'onards and
DeLuca were in thethird floor apart-
ment when the ﬁre broke out. accor-
ding to DeLuca. Assaro lived in the
ﬁrst ﬂoor studio. Tw‘o apartments in
the building were unoccupied.

DeLuca said that all but Assaro
had moved into the building about
three weeks ago. “We didn‘t know
the landlord didn‘t have a certifica-
tion, for occupancy.“ asserted
DeLuca.

Tony Cheh. of United Tenants of
Albany (ii tenant counseling
organization) said. “The landlord.
Michael Rickmun. could never have
legally rented that apartment if he
were following the state code cn—
forcement.“

Yesterday the Albany Times-
Union reported Lawrence Solomon
and Norman Liebewitz to be co-
owners with Rickmun of the burnt
building.

Harold Rubin. also of the United
Tenants of Albany. said that the

[952 New York State Multiple
Residence Law required all “multi-
ple residences. three or more
apartments in one building." to have
either a “second means of exit or a
sprinkler system. This building had
none."

Rickmun said he had contractr

. very

 

J

to have a ﬁre escape built when he

, bought the building last May. He

said he had left‘ a deposit and
building keys with a contractor but
Work had not begun inspite of “some
30 calls that I made." Rickman did
not identify the contractor other
than to say “the city had
recommended one person to do the
fire escape and we applied to him.“

Rickmun added that “a fire escape
may not have helped the residents in
the fire." He pointed to DeLuca‘s be-
ing ttblc to jump to a second floor
landing.

“I know I was lucky as shit.“ said
DeLuca. "Ellen woke me up about
7:30. calling my name and yelling
fire. I went fora window and started
yelling for help and then heard
fin-trucks.

“But the ﬁremen couldn‘t see me.“
he continued. “The smoke was whip-
ping around. Then someone told me
to jump. there was a porch below me.
Some lady next door threw blankets
on me and gave me tea.

“Once I jumped. I knew I was
okay. But I saw Ellen lying on the
ground and knew she was out."

According to DeLuca.
Deutschman had reached for a ﬁre
department ladder as it approached
her third story window. but missed
and fell to the ground.

“We feel the ﬁre originated in the
furnace room.“ said Fire Chief
Joseph Fitzmaurice. “A cause is un—
determined and is under investiga-
tion.“

DeLuca said that a furnace mal-
function may huvc caused the fire.
“the heat was off for 14 days." said
DeLuca. “Then they worked on the
furnace and two days Iatcr thcrc was
zt fire."

DeLuca said Rickmun had
supplied the residents with electric
heaters “hich had short-circuith
and caused them anxiety.

Cheh said Deutschman had ap-
proached him about two weeks ago
to complain about the luck of heat in
her apartment. She had complained
to Rickmun. Cheh said. but was
afraid of complainingto city officials
for fear of being evicted by Rickmun.
Cheh said such rctaliutions by
landlords are cotnmon.

Cheh said Rickman had started to
rehabilitate the building over the
summer but students should not
have been living in it until the city
had inspected the structure and ccr-
tificd it for occupancy.

Mohawk To Achieve Dorm Status

by Joel Feld

Mohawk Tower will be convened
to student dorm use by the beginning
of the 1977-78 term, accordingto SA
President Steven DiMeo. The move
will end six years of faculty and ad-
ministration use of.the tower.

Because of space limitations and
practicality. the moves would not
begin until after the May. I977
semester. said DiMeo. He explained
that all the arrangements for the
departmental moves of of Mohawk
Tower have not yet been ﬁnalized
and that instead of' having the
departments move around during
the school year they would be better
off making the transition during the
summer.

The plans to convert Mohawk
tower were drawn up by President
Field's ofﬁce and specifically calls
for the conversion of at least 50 per-
cent by the beginning of the 1977-78
term. The rest of the tower would be
converted during the l978-79 term.

DiMeo indicated that budget
restrictions and space limits were the
reasons for the two-year transition
period.

The use of Mohawk Tower for
faculty and administration ofﬁces
has been a source of student com-
plaint since the opening of the
building in 1970. At that time dorm
occupancy on the uptown campus
was not at capacity. Thus, the ad-
ministration. faced with a lack of

space on the podium, decided to use
Mohawk Tower for these purposes.

Since I970 however. enrollment
has risen sharply causing a housing
shortage on campus. In I974-75, oc-
cupancy on the uptown campus
reached l I2 percent. causing
students to live either in triples or in
make-shift lounges. In addition.
SUNYA arranged a deal with the
Wellington Hotel in downtown
Albany to help alleviate the housing
shortage.

With the opening of Mohawk
Tower next year. 200 more occupan-
cies will be available followed by
another 200 the following term. The
Wellington contract is on a year-by—
year basis. depending on need.

The building at 48A Dove St.. the day after the blaze oceurtérd which
Injured six people. among them three SUNYA students.

“Only one landlord has been con-
victed in five years for violating this
ordinance." said Cheh. “Albany has
2| code and building inspectors on
the payroll but in l975 they only did
U inspections per day per man." he
added.

"It‘s aggravating. There are so
many buildings just like this one
where landlords just subdivide and
squeeze students." said Cheh.

Rubin said. “Before any building
is offered for occupancy following a
conversion. it must have 'a city in-
spection.“

Albany Commissioner of

Buildings Morris Eiss. whose office
is responsible for building code en-
forcement. could not be reached for
comment Thursday afternoon.

“The university students should
exercise more care in choosing
apartments." Rubin said. “They
should be able to get basic safety for
their good bucks."

Attorney Paul Kietzman. retained
by SA. said. “Potential for suit by
the residents exists. No one held a
gun to Rickman‘s head and said you
have to rent. The fact that applica-
tion for a ﬁre escape was made does
not absolve him from responsibility.”

The board discussed the
procedure by which the corporation
will purchase houses.

Grill said that the corporation
should look for architectural quality
and easy access to transportation.

“The selection process for build-
ings may start as early as December,"
said Welty. “The first thing we will
do is meet with the Capital Hill lm-
provement Corporation which will
help us by showing us how much
rehabilitation the buildings will
need. the estimates of costs. and the
procedures involved in applying for
the loans and grants we will need."

Welty said that he felt “positive
about the opportunity and concept
of this project," but added that it will
entail a lot of work.
