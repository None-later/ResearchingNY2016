Bomb Scare Halts
Moscow Exhibit:
U.S. Suspicious

MOSCOW (AP) An American
Bicentennial exhibit drawing big
Russian crowds was evacuated
Wednesday after a telephoned bomb
threat that left U.S. ofﬁcials angered
and suspicious ofa trick to dampen
the show‘s popularity.

The Soviet co—director. Grigory
Kuzmcnko. said he received a phone
call at l2:24 p.m. fromithe interior
Ministry reporting that an uniden-
tified man had telephoned a warning
that a plastic explosive would go off
at 12:30.

Some l.000 Russian visitors inside
the building were calmly evacuted
from the pavillion. The exhibition.
the second U.S. national show to
come to the Soviet Union in l7 years,
features film showings. photos.
historical displays and a souvenir kit
containing the U.S. Constitution
and the Declaration of In-
dependence in Russian.

A search by American and Rus-
sian ofﬁcials failed to turn up a
bomb.

Police with megaphones told the
long lines of people waiting outside
that the exhibit was closed because
of “technical difficulties." But
American exhibit guides walked
along the line to explain a bomb

threat was the reason. Some waited

four hours before dispersing.

The U.S. exhibit director. Frank
Ursino, angrily asked Soviet officials
why it took more than three hours
for a bomb detection team to arrive
to make certain the paviilion was
safe to reopen the exhibit. The of-
ficials apologized profusely, saying
they had difﬁculty ﬁnding an expert
in plastic explosives.

During the evacuation.
Kuzmenlto, the Soviet ofﬁcial who
took the warning call, remained in
his ofﬁce on the telephone and show-
ed no fear of being a bomb victim.
American ofﬁcials said they also
found it curious that minutes before
the warning call a city ambulance
pulled up to the building for no ap-
parent reason. After the building
