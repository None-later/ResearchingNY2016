lii I’ott'titkt'rt the maximum is

October (1927). Eisenstein prottdly
exhibited itis idcii of “intellectual

"’I'licse pieces werc assembled iii tic-

tual scttlcwpttlling back the coticept
of God to its origins. forcing the
spectator to percech this progress
intellectually."

Throughout his life. Sergei Eisens-

[Eisenstein worked after no set

and exploration is the key factor in
understanding his genius.
