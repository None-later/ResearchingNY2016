words from the “new English"—the
thousands of new words and
meanings that have become firmly
established in the language over the
past lSycars and have added a whole
new dimension to the way we speak.

“The vocabulary of English. like
that ofevcry other living language. is
constantly growing.“ says James
Lowe. associate editor of “6.000
Words." a dictionary of new English
just published by (i.& C. Merriam
Co. "However. the past is years has
probably seen more changes than at
any time in our history.

"We hiive lived through a time of
great social chang' and of world-
shattcring events. and it follows that
we needed new words and new
meanings to express these events."
he adds.

“These range from Vietnam and
the moon landings to the new sexual
permissiveness and the search for
personal identity. We made the word
'establishmcni‘ pejorative. and new
words and phrases ego trip.
counterculture. sexism. funky——
were developed to describe our new
ways of living. new ideas. new
philosophies.“

The most prolific sources of new
words were science and technology.

Lena Tweed glanced up from her
crochetingjust long enough to greet
us as we walked into her room. At
9|. her mind still sharp. her ﬁngers
still quick. she began talking about
her favorite subject—her family.

Mrs. Tweed is a resident of the
Daughters of Sarah Nursing Home.
a private. beautiful home located on
the Washington Ave. Extension.

l was at the home with several
SUNYA students who are involved
with the Adopt a Grandparent
program sponsored by the Jewish
Students Coalition.

The basis of the program. accor-
ding to Elayne Gold. one ofthe pre-
sent coordinators of the program
and “grand-daughter" of Mrs.
Tweed. “. . . is to provide company
for the people in the Daughters of
Sarah Nursing Home. A lot of the

The “Adopt a Grandparent" program,

who looks forward each week to a
visit by her “grandchild”. when she
can talk for an hour or more with
someone with whom. she has
developed a close personal
relationship. “It changes here so
much". she said. “once we were all
well. but now everyone is in
wheelchairs or using walkers." She
paused to show off some handmade
baskets and afghans to some young
onlookers.

The JSC program is now in its se-
cond year and was started by the
Social Action Committee of that
group. “We felt that there was a need
by the residents of the nursing home
who didn‘t have family or anybody
close by to have someone to talk to
on a otie-to-one basis." said lreta
Zaretsky. one of the people who
helped to get the program going last
year.

lreta's grandmother of one anda
half years is Julia Herman. 83. On
the day that we talked to her. she was
not feeling well. She sat bent over in

and sets out to see what. if anything.
he remembers from the Universal of
I959. It is a clear. beautiful morning.

About 300 tourists have already
gathered in a tree-lined reception
area. Three TV sets are lodged in the
trees. showing clips from Universal
movies like "Jaws" and “Earth-
quake.” promoting thcm with
poorly-focused electronic gusto.

A man in top hat andtails. his face
made up to resemble either an ape or

After 35 minutes ol'this. the line of
pilgrims starts moving. We become
part of the record 2.9 million folks
Universal estimates will have taken
the tour by year‘s end.

About l00 in my crowd of friend-
ly. amiable sight-scers are shown to a
line of four trams. where they are
greeted by Susie. a young. chipper.
enthusiastic guide.

She introduces iierself over the
public address system and urges one

We set out and see a small pit
where. Susie says. a model of the
dirigible Hindenberg was burned for

the weight of age upon it. She said,

the brief smile we reserve for the
elderly.

According to Ms. Zaretsky.
students who join the program are

‘ asked to fill out an application which

asks for foreign languages spoken.
hobbies. interests. etc. to help deter-
mine which residents they would be
best suited to work with. This is done
by Joan Rosenstein. who is incharge
of volunteers at the home.

“They ask that you devote at least
one hourn week.“ Ms. Zuretskysaid.
"This isn‘t a typical volunteer
program. It‘s supposed to be more of
a closer rclationsbip~likc with a
real grandparent."

People involved in the program
feel that it is a success. according to
Ms. Gold. and it is growing. “Last

We also see from our hillside van-

and a tall. black office building that
Susie says “houses all the big ex-
ecutives here."

No doubt one ofthem is Jay Stein.

It is kind of disappointing when
you consider that this season. no less
that [4 TV series are shootingal the
Universal lot. among them “Haret-
ta." "Kojack" and "Rockford Files,"
Oh. well.

On to the soundstnges. where the
tram halts in front of a huge cor-
rugated metnl building and we see
big signs touting such coming Un-
iversal movies as “Airport '77“ and
"Jaws 2."

We dismount and tour a typical
star's quarters. Susie says this one
was used by Lucille Ball. It has three
rooms. one a large living room with
French Empire furniture and a
fireplace. But no Lucille.

After that. Stage 32. used only for
the tour. We get a rundown on a
photography process. see “an exact

volved in the program." she said.
“This year we have about 20-25 peo-
ple at the home."

Our visit with Mary Gleisher. 85.
is an example ofthe good that can be
accomplished by the program. When
we entered the room which she was
in. she was a lonely figure sitting off
by herself. staring into spacc. Mrs.
(ileislier also has a grand-daughter
in the program. but she was not there
that day. Within a minute site was
smiling and talking to us with that
particular emphasis on young love
that all of the residents love to talk
about. “I‘ve been a matchmaker
many times . . . “ she began. a
youthful twinkle in her eyes that was
brought to life byjust a few minutes
of attention.

It would be hard to say who gets
more out of the program: the
residents or the student volunteers.
“I always fecl"good when I come'
back from the home. even if I was
upset when I went there.“ said Ms.
Zaretsky. “My suitemates used to
laugh at me last year because I would

Ms. Gold. “You feel good about it."

Mrs. Tweed. while talking of her
family and pulling out that mul-
titude ol‘ pictures that every grand-
mother seems to have. said that her
children. grandchildren. and great-
grandchildrcn visited her during the
warmer months. but go away for the

got her.“ and smiled iit her “grand-
daughter“.

Care for the elderly has been a
groiving concern in this country in
the past decade or so. and one ofthe
major obstacles to overcome is that
of loneliness. Those “golden years“
of our lives can be a lonely time. and
a young person willing to spend a
few hours talking and listening can
make all the difference inthe World.

The Adopt a (irundparent
program appears to be dealing with
that problem successfully. Many
close relationships have been form-
ed. and more than one nurse at the
