'  performanceliistory of the
symptoms- of the late Dmitri
Shostakovich (19064976) reads like
_ a Bolshevik, diary. In I926, his first
' go at the symphonic medium was
‘ well in the liberal climate of

years old, reveled in international
acclaim. ~. ' . ’

1 .. His enthusiastic reception by
j.,Co'rin'nunist .I’arty regulars is the
'more surprising in view of the avant-
garde nature of his first symphony.
The opening movement is atonal,
and abounds with satirical themes;
though the remainder of the piece is
traditionally structured, the
irreverent playfulness which
permeates it is in sharp contrast to
the normally solemn. straight-
forward taste of Party regulars.

' As part of his newly-acquired
fame and his growing political
awareness, Shostakovich later
sought to satisfy the government‘s
desire for patriotic music. His Se-
cond Symphony. titled “A Dedica-
tion to October." appeared on the
tenth anniversary of the Revolution;
the Third was dedicated for perfor-
mance during May Day
celebrations.

During the mid-thirties, as Rus-
sian Communism under Stalin
began to purge itself. music reviews
announced that Shostakovich had
fallen out of favor. To maintain a
low profile. he withdrew his Fourth
Symphony before its first perfor-

sensation.

Shosta kovieh may well have saved
his life with Symphony No: 5, titled
“A soviet Artist's Reply to Just
Criticism" (I937). The noisin tragic-

When: his Sixth

hearted work, failed to measure up
to Party expectations, his reputation

shielded him from direct persecu-

tion. , r

A cloud hung over his head,
nevertheless. into the Second World
War. Shostakovich was caught in
the German siege of his home town
Leningrad. His Seventh Symphony.
written during the siege and named
after the city. paid tribute to Russia's
suffering and eventual triumph.
Written on a scale rivalling Mahler‘s
greatest symphonies. this work won
for Shostakovich the status of a war
hero. The Eighth Symphony, also
written during the war. was in a
similarly colossal "epic-tragic"
mold.

Again Shostakovich paused for
breath. His Ninth Symphony
amounted to a cheerful satire on
classical symphonic patterning; it
ran a mere twenty-five minutes. as
opposed to “Leningrad's” hour and a
quarter. Soviet scorn was balanced
by international approval.

I3. titled “Babi Yar“. was a
symphony-cantata. set to poems of
the Russian author Yevgeni ch-

   

tushenko, decrying persecution of
Jews during the Second World War.
The work passed through the Stalin-
Khrushchev interregnum, but came
in for scathing criticism several years
later. It is seldom performed.

Shostakovich‘s ﬁnal works in the
symphonic mode. Nos. l4 and IS
(the latter premiered in I972). return
to the gentle. contemplative mood of
his first symphony. A comparison
between his ﬁrst and last symphonies
reveals increased sophistication in
the treatment of themes and the
handling of instruments: however,
the steadiness of Shostakovich‘s
character through thick and thin is
revealed as well. '

Shostakovich's versatility as a
compoacr of consistently high-
quality symphonies is unmatched in
this century. His tactful orchestra-
tion achieves miracles. where most
contemporary symphonists stumble
into overstatement. His feel for
theme and counter-theme. coupled
with his melodic wit. frees him from
the need to recapitulate. He main-
tains suspense. in partnership with
humor. through the never-ending
variety of his music.

Shostatakovich shares with
Mahler a sense of urgency. the in-
ability to remain lyrical. Ilc
gravitates nervously from the
humorous to the clegaic to the
dramatic. It is as though he wrote
with a Soviet censor peering over his
shoulder. constantly demanding.
"Get to the point!"

Many aspects of America's
history are reflected in place-names
throughout the country. We are not
surprised to ﬁnd beside English
place-names others which are In-
dian. Spanish. Dutch. German. or
French in origin. Classical place-
names are also fairly common.

As early as 1663. a tract of land
along the Potomac River was called
Rome. Philadelphia. Pennsylvania.
was so named by William Penn in
I68! or I682. and one can find a half-
dozcn other places in the country by
that name. Mt. Olympus.
Washington (there is another one in
Connecticut). was so named by Cap-
tain John Mcarcs. an English
voyager. in I788. and that eventually
suggested OII'III/ria as a name for
Washington‘s capital city.

Cincinnati. which was named
after the Roman hero Cincinnatus.
Athens. Ohio. and Athens. Georgia.
received their names in l800 and
[801 respectively when it had been
decided to establish colleges there.
New York‘s village ofAtltcns was es-
tablished in “(05; in I969 it became
the temporary honte of Columbia-
(irccnc Community College. ()I
lesser fame also are R hode Island‘s
Mt. Hygeia. Alabama's Styx River.
Michigan‘s Pompeii. Utah‘s l'nn-
talus Creek. California‘s Mt.
Vesuvius. Oregon's Rome. and
Hawaii‘s Mt. ’I‘antulus.

New York State is especially rich
in classical place names. In I789 the
people of Vandcrhcyden‘s Ferry

renamed their village 'I'ror; today

there are no fewer than 3| places in
the U.S. by that name. In I790
classical place-names were given toa
long list of townships around
Cayuga Lake: Aurelius. Camillus.
Cato. Cincinnatus. Fabius. Hector.
Homer. Lysander. Mttnlius.
Marcellus. Ovid. Romulus. Ulysses.
and Vergil. Even Rome‘s fiercest
enemy. Hannibal. was not forgotten.
Cicero made the list twice. once as
'I‘u/h' and once as Circru. The com-
missioncrs who were charged with
naming the townships apparently
did not know that the two names
refer to the same man: a fondness of
classical names does not necessarily
imply ntuch classical learning.
Collectively all of these towns are

singers. and other musicians will
converge on All Saints Cutltcdral for
Albany‘s second St. Cecilia Festival.
A variety of works are scheduled for
this free concert presented by local
artists.

Coordinator Myron I'aylor
stresses that it is a secular communi-
ty event. not a church function; “90
per cent of last year‘s attendance had
nothing to do with the church." He
further emphasizes “that the concert
will be quite informal. We expect to
have part of the audience sitting on

 

 

known as New York's “classical

belt."

Classical place-names continued
to be popular in New York State for
several more decades. Utica was
named in I7II9. perhaps in honor of
Cato the Younger. also known as
Cato Uticcnsis from the fact that he
committed suicide at ancient Utica
in 46 Il.C. Attica and Ithaca follow-
ed in Iltll. Rome in Itll9. and
Syracuse in I825. New York‘s Cor.
intlt must share that name with a

St. Cecilia l'csti .tls have long been
a part of European musical history
but have been celebrated in this
country only in St.l.onis and
Albany. After her martyrdom. the
legendary figure was honored as the
patron saint of music and was
credited with the invention of the
organ.

 

The festival assumed special im-
portance in Restoration England
when it helped to restore music to
church services. Henry Purcell com-
