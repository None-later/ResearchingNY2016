Poor Richie Furaywtrying to
’duplicate the elusive success of
“Kind Woman" ever since Buffalo
Springﬁeld. His attempts led him
through Poco and the short-lived
Souther. Hillntan and Foray Band.

He misses the mark once again
with ii group bearing ltis own name
and an ill-conceived album. I’ve (lo/

reason to listen to the album at all.

If an album can suffer from too
nittch consistency. this one does. Il'it
weren‘t lot the spaces between the
tracks. it would sound like one
gigantic single. The melodies are

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) Whatever
happened to Bruce Sprinpteen?

:_ 'Lut fill. hi! bearded face smiled
out from the covers of Time and
Newsweek, marking the triumph of
his third album. “Born to Run."

But there wasn't a follow-up. and
- conjecture spread that perhaps
Sprinptecn had been a ﬂash-in-thc-
pan media creation. But with a per-
formance at the Oakland
Paramount, one of a dozen stops on
a national tour this fall, the now
clean-shaven Springsteen laid that
conjecture to rest.

The 27-year-old singer and
guitarist. his six-piece band and the
four-man Memphis horns put on a
tremendous show.

In Oakland, and elsewhere on the
tour. Springsteen proved his mastery
of styles ranging from Bo Diddley‘s
urban blues to Jackson Browne's
suburban poetry. His new material is
as impressive as his old, and his
bump rountine with sax player
Clarence Clemmons during
“Rosalita” was a high point of the
genuine communion that Springs-
tccn has with his musicians. his
audience and his music.

But along with Springsteen's
beard. his innocence is gone. Speak-
ing from the lip of the stage in the
middle of his set. he told the
audience that his long—awaited
fourth album will “be out as soon asI
learn my lesson in show business."

He has sued his manager for
breach of contract and in turn has
been enjoined from recording with
CBS. the Columbia Broadcasting
System's record company atid with

King Tut’s Treasure on Show En MasSe

WASHINGTON (AP) The 6th Earl
of Carnarvon has said he would
never for a million pounds visit the
tomb of King 'l‘tit-Ankh-Amen that
his lather helped uncover. but be has
changed his mind.

“At this stage I sure would. but I‘d
like to he paid in gold rather than
pounds." he said in an interview.
lord (‘arnarvom 7b. is somethingol’
it skeptic about the curse which is
supposed to hang over the discovery

one-Incocjnn

of King I'ut‘s tomb in I922. alter it
had lain hidden for more than 3.000
years.

His father‘s mysterious death. he
says. might not have happened if
there had been antibiotics in I922.
but he cannot find a rational ex-
planation for why all the lights in
Cairo went out or why a lamlly dog
back in England died at the same
time.

The earl. born Henry Ilerbert. is

in Washington in connection with
the opening next Wednesday of the
largest exhibition of Tut-Ankh-
Amen treasures ever to be sent
abroad by the Arab Republic of
Egypt

The exhibition of 55 gold.
alabaster and jeweled objects will be
on view at the National (iallery of
Art for four months. after which it
will travel to live other U.S. cities
over the next 2‘/; years.
