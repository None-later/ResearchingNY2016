'oupi’ are treated equally.” Nothing could be

y, In many areas of this country, people of
utoui ethnic backgrounds are no more
elcoine than a black man in Jimmy Carter‘s
hutch. Blatantly separating blacks from "all
ther ethnic groups" can only serve to further
lariic them from others. What is needed are
are compensatory education and equal op-
rtunity programs. not naive cliches.
Indeed. what are these “startling discoveries
bout ourselves” which can arise from ex-
mination of Judy Ricardo’s article? True. we
0 have quite a way to go to achieve any
mblance of equality and justice. yet it does
m that in many circles we are working
owards this end. There seems to be more con-
rn about this problem than any other related
ne at this time. and deservedly so. We are,
owever. approaching a workable solution.
oday there are more blacks enrolled in in-
titutions of higher education and working at
ood payingjobs than at any other time. and
lowly but surely. the gap between blacks and
bites will decrease. There do exist in our
ociety today many gross inequalities. but the
ay to work them out is in practical terms, not

and girlfriend

To the Editor:

As co-winners of the Bahamas 'l'rip. Dave
anti l were tnentioned briefly in last Friday‘s
editioii of the ASP as “David Mallach and
Mallaoh‘s girlfriend Susie Wong.“ As happy
as we are about winning the trip. we are disap-
pointed in the manner in which you identified
as in the article. I am a friend of both (ilen
Cosman and Susan Rosencrantt. and not
Simply “Mallach‘s girlfriend." If the ASP had
written “Wong’s boyfriend David Mallaeh." it
would have been j’itst as unfair and degrading.
In the future we suggest yott phrase yottr
sentences more carefully and take into con-
sideration our status in society as equal in-
dividuals.

the implications . . .

To the Editor:

A very agonizing dilemtnn faced a group of
student journalists this past Monday.

A story I had written for the Albany Stu-
dent Press concerned the arrests of four
SU NYA students on felony drugchurges. Two
of those students demanded that their ttatnes
not be printed.

If following only the ethical code ofjour-
nalism. there would be no doubt that the
Students‘ names and other relevant informa-
tton should have been included in the story.
Those facts were a matter of public record;
‘hel’ were accessible to any interested party.
Besides what is a newspaper‘s function if not
to inform?

But. there was much more involved than the
ASP editors‘ striving for pi ’ ' "
There was the human element of two

\

emotional students fearing repercussions of a}
story mentioningtheir names. 

. As Monday night grew into Tuesday mor-
ning. friends 'of the suspects and friends of the
editorsbegan to call. “How could you do this
to fellow students?" There were threats of a '
court-imposed gag order. charges of “ruining
their lives."

What had to be determined was: What right
would any writer or any editor have to withold
public information? These were facts
of the case — no unattributed accusations.
but all veriﬁed data. To set a precedent
of leaving out information (that this un-
iversity community has every right to know)
would damage the newspaper's credibility for
a longtime to come.

What if the case involved a faculty member
or an administrator? it would be nothing less
than an ASP scandal if those facts were to
remain unprinted.

To say that anyone had an easy decision to
make Monday night would be an indication of
sheer ignorance. The editors of the Albany
Student Press made the only decision they
could. To leave out the names would create
many more problems than the relatively
minimal ones printing them would cause for
those four students.

. . . and the ethics

To the I‘Iditor:

We are writing in response to the article on
the drug bust in the ASP of Tuesday. Nov.
lo. We understand why the article was im-
portant news to be printed. indeed. the infor-
mation that ihe Albany Police are cracking
down on off campus students is relevant to a
large portion of the SUNYA. population.
However. we don‘t understand why the names
ol the arrested students were included in the
article. The impact of the article would not
have been diminished had their names not
been mentioned. The students had not yet
been arraigned when the article went to press.
and the) still haven‘t been. as the arraignment
was postponed Ior two weeks. l’his. however.
seemed to make little difference to the editors
of the ASI’. who went ahead and printed the
names alter several reqttcsts from the students
not to do so. lhat this could result in personal
damages tor the students. especially if the
charges are dropped at the arraignment, seem-
ed to be less important to the editors of the
ASPthan theirjournalistie duty. Drug posses-
sion is a \ictimless crime who was busted is
not important to the SUNYA community.
only that there was a bust.

ltsscnlially the issue here is that the editors
of the ASP let their journalistic concerns
override human concerns. The ethics ofjour-
ualtsm should not be separated from personal
ethics, It is much simpler to cling to a code of
journalism than to carefttlly consider an issue
and its implications. 'l‘herc are times when the
possible risks involved justify omitting essen-
tially unnecessary. bttt potentially harmful in-
formation. In ottr opinion. this drug bust arti-
cle was one of tltose times.

 illnebalesance :-

The, last thing students at SUNYA need islanother loop of barbed wire
around their necks. The return of distribution requirements is an idea
currently beingtossed around over in the administration building, and it
all comes down to a question of the university as factory or the university
as education center.

Distribution requirements would mandate that all students take
eertain courses, or at least courses in certain area. The ideal result being.
of course, Renaissance Man, a Well-rounded individual. But to force
Plato and Socrates down the throat of someone who would rather be
studying inertia and entropy is to do a great injustice to the freedom of
the individual.

Granted, a large segment of the student population does exist in an
intellectual vacuum; the Art History major who thinks DNA and RNA
refer to the two-party system and the accounting major whose writing
expertise is limited to debit and credit lines in a ledger are not unheard-
of . But to impose distribution requirements is to attack the problem at
the wrong end.

Between the ages of five and 18, a student is exposed to a vast array of
knowledge in the .primary and secondary education systems. The
individuals curriculum is, for the most part, preordained. Upon
graduating high school, he theoretically knows where his general
interest lies and is able to responsibly choose a course of study.

This doesn’t happen often. But to transform a university into an
extension of high school in an attempt to guide and round out an
individual is a mistake.

Distribution requirements will simply herd hundreds of students
together in Lecture Centers for low-level science, English and
mathematics courses. They will not help broaden the boundaries ofa
university education, they will only create the illusion ofa well-rounded
individual; someone who can retain memorized notes long enough to be
able to spit them back for a “B” in the course.

An education can only be effective ifthe spirit is willing; force-feeding
is a large step backward. Students come to the university by choice. They
pay their tuition. and they have the right to decide how they will spend
their 15 class hours each week.

For those who desire some sort of guidance, individual departments
offer varying degrees of structure within a major, and academic
advisement can lend a hand.

it is a university‘s obligation to offer a choice, and to help the student
make that choice — not to make the choice for him.
