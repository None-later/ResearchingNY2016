(AP) “I don't feel my age.” says Bill
Bradley with a smile. At 33. the
Princetonian and Rhodes Scholar is
settling down to the role of senior
citizen and resident sage of the New
York Knicks.

After IO years as a- starter. the 6-
foot~5 Bradley is a benchwarmer
playing behind Jim McMiIIian. ﬁve
years his junior.

This is his ﬁnal season—he‘s
already announced his intention to
retire at the close of the current
National Basketball Association
campaign.

have no intention of changing my
mind.“ he said. “There are other
things I like as much as this game.
and it‘s time I got around to doing
some of them." He would not specify
what those other things are.

Switching from starter to reserve
has not been easy.

“It‘s a rhythm thing.“ he explain-
ed. “I‘m still trying to find out what I
need to do to be ready. I don‘t know
whether I should work out hard the
day before a game. the day of a
game. or what. When you don‘t play.

dition. But I didn't play for nine
days. and when I ﬁnally got in I
found I wasn‘t tired.

"I‘m still looking for the right me-
dian. how much I have to do to stay
in shape. I haven't figured it out yet."

Bradley knows most of his playing
is behind him. '

“It's important that the younger
people play.“ says the Knicks‘ senior
citizen. “What‘s hardest for me is to
be ready every night. even though I
know I mightnot play. It‘s an adjust-
ment. but I hope it works out. Istill
want to help. however I can.“

'Foley redeemed herself on the next a
play by making a ﬁne over—the-net
shot on the third team shot which led
to a side-out for Albany. Weitzberg‘s
power serve was knocked out of
bounds by the visitors and the
Spikettes were only one point away.
But the ﬁnal point took a long time
in coming. RPI managed to‘stave off
defeat and even notch another point
before the end.
But the end came when Weitzberg
made a lunging dig. Curtin made a

set to  net. and Leikkanen drilled
her game-winning spike.

The Spikettes have now compiled
a 274 record in twa years as a club
team. However. Kolln and Foley will
be graduating next year and
Weitzberg will be transferring. But
Cunningham feels the remaining
members of the team will be able to
carry on.

, Hard Work

“They really worked hard, they
believed in one another.“ said Cun-
ningham. “I was very pleased with the
season." Who wouldn‘t be?
