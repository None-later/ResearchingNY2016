* Warren  Repart

0n the IJth anniversary of the
death of John F. Kennedy. Kennedy
assasination theories are rtn in-
creasingly popular topic of interest
on college campuses. According to
an article in the December issue of
Gallery lttagttIinc. few students
believe thitt tlte findings of the
Warrert Commission are
authoritative or totally 'alid.

At some colleges the assassination
theory has become art activist issue.
Chris Cont 'iiy. editor of the st trderit
paper at the University of Missouri.
relates that itis school‘s st ttderit body
sctt'tic has endorsed a resolution ask-
ing Missouri‘s Congressional delega-
tion to press for an investigation into
Kennedy‘s murder. with lobbying by
a group of campus assassination
bull's.

Spreading Controversy

Yet. on other campuses. students
generally observe tlte spreading con-
troversy and theories without titkiiig
any action.

As Rohcrh Walker. editor of the
student paper at the llriiverstiy of
Utah remarked. “This attitude scents
to reflect that ‘iiiid back‘ wait-arid-
see approach common to isolated
bitl aware communities "

On most campuses. articles and
speakers on assassination con-
spiracies illCi‘ 'asingly draw students‘
attention. .lan Selinger. editor oftlie
campus paper rrt Pennsylvania State

University. remarked in the
Decent her issttc oi' (r'rlllt‘rt't but when
the [apruder trim of the assassina—
tion wits shown on her campus. the
c\cnt was attended by it near-
capacity ct'thd.

llic college stirdents‘ remarks in
the (iul/r't'r article clearly
dcritonstratc that Amer .r s cttrrciit

 

 

  

crop ofwcollcgc age youth were .
profoundlyaffected bythe Kennedy '1 ’
iniition. even though the ma-:

it
jority of college students were pre-
seiioolers til the time.

 

According to Selinger. "'l‘oday‘s .

college students were then too young
to seriously think ahotrt the
assassination brick in [90.1. They are
just now beginning to grasp what it
all means. Sure we remember the day
Kennedy was shot. And not only do
we remember the day. we probitbly
remember exactly what we were do-
ing when we heard the net 

‘ Although the college editors sur-
\cycd in the (itIl/ergr' itrticle were of
the opinion that the country had not
been told the truth by the Warren
Commission. neither did they
believe that the Warren Commission
deliberately lied to the ptlblieconcer-
iiirig their findings.

Walker sitid. “The Warren Com—
mrnission obviously did not do itsjob.
'I here are too many irregularities
and investigativesliortcorirings in its
report. i don't believe the Warren
Coittntission consciously or willittgly
lied to tire American public: bitt
rather. gripped by tire pressure of
lingering emotional trauma. sought
re 'suraricc in the pioclamatiori of
selected facts as the truth.

“Now the only truth we ltave is the
widespread feeling l but the real story
is possibly more massive. more corri-

plex. and more deeply coritieetcd to
the vital organs oi our government
titan we want to r'citli/e.“

Steve Brown. editor ol'tlic student
er at Southern Methodist llri-
. ty in Dallas. 'l'exas. said. “The
people ol this country were a little
too quick to accept what the iri-
vcstigation revealed iii'tlie Sixties.

Thanksgiving Customs Change

(AP) A lot of old traditions have
died out. liven 'l‘ltitnksgivirig iias
changed. It used to bctltat the people
ol'tlie New World beheaded it young
girl to mark the occasion. You just
don‘t see that sort of sacrifice
anymore.

Of course that particular custom
was peculiar to the Indians. not the
Pilgrims. Mexican AIICCS offered a
damsel to the corn goddess Xiioneri.
A similar practice was coriirtiott
among the l’itwncc, while other
North American lndiaris used a corn
dance to celebrate the harvest.

it just goes to show that the
modern picture of Thanks-
giving ~-- religious refugees in
somber costumes offering thanks for
it skirt-ol-tlic—tccth existence— is it
little out of focus.

'I‘ite l’iigrims weren‘t even the first
English settlers on this side of the
Atlantic to have a l‘ltartksgiving.

As harvest festivals.
'lltanksgivings stretch back to the
ancients ol' ligypt. Syria.
Mesopotamia and Route.

Such celebrations survived in
medieval (iermany. l‘l‘illlCC. Holland
and England as the Roman Catholic
Feast of St. Martin. It Wits observed
each Nov. ll coincidentally the
day in 1620 when the Pilgrims set
sail.

lly that titiic a biirid ol' lirigiislimen
in Virginia held a Thanksgiving on

a plantrition about 30 miles west of

.liiriicstown. liic day was Dec. 5.
l()|9. An order of the Virginal
Comparty of London decreed:

"We ordain that the day of our
slirps‘ arrival iii the place assigned
lor planting in the land ol Virginia
sliirll be yearly and perpetually kept
holy as it day oi thanksgiving to
Almighty God." ‘

Mciorc that. English fishermen at
Newfoundland had observed a day
at thanksgiving in ISM. and in tour
the people oi'the l’opliam Colony on
the Maine coast set aside such a day.

Nevertheless. it‘s the Pilgrim ver-
sion oi the event that citpturcd the
American imagination.

Venison. duck. goose. iish. eels.
white bread. corn. leeks. watercress.
greens. pittrns and berries were on
the iirst rrieritr. but turkey and
pumpkin pie \tcrcn't listed in records
ol the event.
