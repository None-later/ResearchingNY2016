about ll: women‘s small press
marmlanikovnys‘.. . itis
an enormous talent. big enough to
medium the room, biggr than this
building. biggerthan the Hearst tas-
tle.“

Many writers have turned to the
small pressnurketaltertbeirltmner
publiutions have disappared intbe
lace ofthcestablisbed literary world.
Facing a difficult commercial press
market is women's podry. As a
result. presses like the Alice James
Press in Boston. named for Henry
and William's sister. D3303 Press in
Baltimore and the now defunct
Shameless Hussy Press have pros-id-
ed a resource of women's literature
that faced a brick wall in the public
market. .

“We are ignored or condescended
to by male small presses‘ says
Marilyn Zuckertmn of the Alice
James Press. A: a result. women's
presses have developed around the
country. A! the University of Oregon
at Eugene, women have recently
released an anthology of their poetry
callcd No More Packaged Deals.
The anthology grew out of a
women‘s poetry workshop and what
Bernikow calls a "it omen's counter-
culture in publishing.“

Shameless H ussy Press which was
founded by a woman named Alta
managed to find and translate a rare
copy of George Sand‘s The Haunted
Paul. The California-based press
was just one of many that concen-
trated on new themes in women's
literature which range from anger to
affirmation.

But women's presses are only one
example of the need for small
presses. At William Paterson
College in New Jersey. the student
government gave SZOOOtoa group to
sponsor a literary magazine called
“(jet Well Quick.” Co—editor An—
drew Vaupcl said of the effort.
“ . this type of publication ex-
ists for the sakes of those indisiduals
who need to express their abcrated
ideas . . . this insanity is unisersal
and now. all ofthc admired cuckoos
haw a chance to let it all out and
have it published.“

The need for small presses is also
evident in a unique venture by Ran-
dom House Publishers. Moon
Books is a new San Francisco
feminist press co—publishcd by the
large commercial publishing house
and is part of the number of small
presses which abound intbe Bay area
in California. The National Endow-
ment for the Arts (NEA) and private
foundations are making it easier to
publish and this year the NEA dis—
pensed $345,000 to “2 small
presses.

The existence of small presses is
clear enough but how does one go
about producing a book? Well, the
process is deliberate and business-
orientcd. Making friend . in the prin-
ting business helps. Typesetting can
often add one~third of the ﬁnal cost
to the book. If one's friends are in the
printing business. this may be done

gratis.

FACELIFTING MARS

a-feasibillty study which concludes

the red planet could be turned into a
liveable retreat. complete with a
breathable atmosphere and running‘
water. . -

The Chicago Tribune reports thlt
one of the project‘s scientists. Doctor
Richard Young, believes the effort to
re-engincer Mars could begin before
the end of this century.

Doctor Young says that NASA
feasibility reports show that Mars
could be settled by humans after us-
ing satellites to spray charcoal
powder on the cold polar caps of the

planet. Young explains that this'

could result in settlers from Earth
eventually living and working on the
martian surface in shirtslecvcs.

In the meantime. Cornell
astronomer Doctor Curl Sagttn is
warning about attempts by humans
to change Mars. Sagan says that
Mars may contain low forms of life
and. if so. we shouldn‘t tamper with
it. Says Sagan: “ll'thcre arc microbes
