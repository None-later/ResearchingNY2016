called Thursday night for the
building of a new f‘Leniniat-Marxist

By DAN (MINES

I worry about the world. but
Saturday night madc mcfccl bcttcr.

Most people cannot carry on a
conversation with more than ten per
cent of tire rest of the world. Actions
that are sins in one society are
heralded in another. Onc right or
kind of justice is important in one
place. another right or srnsc of
justice important clscwhcrc. We are
very different. It's a wonder we
cooperate at all.

But it's to our advantage to
cooperate. and fortunately most
countries rcali/c this. There are
many arguments about thc best way
to coopcrutc, and about who's get-
ting thc best of whom. butcvcryonc
iigrccs they should cooperate.

The countries of the world do all
kinds of things to understand cuclt
other so they can cooperate in
fighting the world‘s problems. One
of thc things they do is scnd students
to study in cuch others' countries.

Sometimes there are students
from many countries all attending ll
school in a country forcigit to them.
Sometimes all these students join
together to form a group to make
ctich other ntorc comfortable. to iii-
crciisc their ability to Icarnubout the
country they are studying itt, rind to
increase the ability of students nutch
to that country to learn about the in.
tcrnutionul students.

An International

tion." This past Saturday evening.
they held their major event of the
year. International Night.

The audience at Page Hall was
entertained by clcvcn acts performed
by differcnt groups of international
students and performed with
sometimes. thcir American friends.

International Night serves an im-
portant function for ISA. and it is in-
variably entertaining ns well. Yet its
role as a facilitator for increased iii-
tcrnational understanding is its most
distinctive quality.

thn a Soviet exchange student
sings folk songs from his homeland.
the audience l'ecls closer to him.
When ltc sings Bob Dylan‘s lilowt‘n'
In the Wind. the audience is struck
by the significance of Dylan‘s lyrics
reaching beyond our borders. When
he finishes with a song he wrote
himself, the audience begins to feel
they know him. And because they
know hint. they know morc about
the Soviet Union.

Tilt: different styles of each tict
Saturday night made it vcry easy to
enjoy. Thc variation was more than
just intcrcsting; it was an illustration
of the world as it really is today.

Irish folksoitgs are sung by art
lrislt exchange student and two
Americans. Black Americans per-
form in African Dance and Drums,
"Burundi". There are Spntiishsongs.
Chinese instrumentals. ll German
Choir. No tWo pieces are exactly
alike. No two pieces liavc the same

separate black nation.

Baraka traced the need for a new
radical party to an alledged “sell--
out" of blacks by the American l
Communist Party in the 1930‘s. He
claimed the Party abandoned its one
time advocacy of a “self determining
black nation of the South" in its ef-
forts to establish a broad (‘liberal
front' against Nazi Germany. The
American Communist Party became
“complctcly revisionist" as had.
Baraka said. its counterpart in the
“imperialist socialist Soviet Union."

The activist felt the black political
movement in America undcrwcnt
similar “rcvisionism”. or dilution of
radical principle. Baraka saw civil
rights lcadcrs Roy Wilkins and Mar-
tin Lutltcr Kinng. as “spokesmen of
thc black bottrgcosic". in effect lcn-
dingsupport‘tothc whitc establish-
ment. The only diffcrcncc betwecn
the white and black bourgeosic. said
Buruka. is that “one sells Afro-
Sheen. the other Vaseline."

The writer praised Malcolm X. the
slain black nationalist. as a leader
who offered a radical political alter-
native based upon the “black work-
ing class" as opposed to the

bourgcosic. Baraka supported
Malcolm X‘s policy of“sc|f-dcfcnsc“
ovcr King's supposed advice of “turn
the other cheek until you don't have
any checks left." Baraka‘s feelings
sccmcd to have changed little since
he wrote a poem in praise of
Malcolm X eleven years ago:

'...l)lack man, quit Whining and

message. Confusing“!

It‘s confusing. but much less so
than if the show was never per-
formed. thn made aware of
cultural variation. we also realize
what all pcoplc have Ill common.
Political diffcrcrtccs are all the
newspapcrs report. but not till there
is.

I left International Night inn plca-
sant. hopeful mood. I still worry
about thc world.

But not as much.

The Manhattan Trio Misses Mark

By STEPHEN EISENMAN

The clcments that form a good
chamber ensemble. individual
proficiency. knowledge of the
literature, and musical teamwork.
require years of constant practice
and performance. Perhaps the
Manhattan Trio. together a scant 6
years, are still growing. Judging by
the performance Sunday at Page
HallI there were signs that these
three might onc day achieve
greatness.th their occasional
ensemble and intoiititional problems
resulted in an unsatisfying afternoon
of music. in this the second Universi-
ty Celebrity series concert.

The performers. Ariana llrnnnc,
violin. David Wells, cello. and
Joseph Seigcr. piano, all have il-

Harakajustified H. Rap Brown's
violent dictum “ ‘if it (society) don't
turn around. burn it tothc ground‘ ".
saying that in thc United States a
peaceful transition to Communism
is impossible.

“Will a Rockefeller or a Mellon
wake up one morning and give the
state away?" he asked rhctorically.
“Capitalism cannot be worked with.
capitalism must be smashed."

Baraka justified black secession
onthc grounds that American blacks
meet Stalin‘sdelinition ofa nation as
having a separate common
language. economic lift: and culture.
He also condemned the United
Stated world power status for being
hc said built upon the slat/c trade.

The best path towards revolution,
said the writer. was through the for-
mation of a united Marxist party.
“The act of uniting Marxist-

lustrious musical backgrounds.
IIronnc, the daughter of the famous
violin teacher. Raphael Bronstcin,
demonstrated some technical vir-

seriously marred her performance.

David Wclls. the recipient of it
number of musical awards. is on the
faculty of Manhattan and Ham
Schools of Music. He was in fine
fornt on Sunday. Ills playing was
virtuostic rind cncrgetic. As such. he
occasionally overpowered the other
performers, especially Mr. Seigcr at
the piano.

Joseph Scigcr was for many years
accompanist to violinist Mischa
lilmun. Certainly this enabled him to
perfect his piunlssimo technique.

Leninists wins the advance to Com-
tnunism.“said Ilaraka. who warned
however of “sham Marxists.“ The
lccturcr callcd Angela Davis a “fifth
columnist of the Soviet Union“ and
lambasted “Hakuninistanarchist
Eldridge Clcavcr."

Throughout the spccch Baraka
spoke in Marxist terminology.
sometimes using the exact quotes
from Communist authorities. Al on
point he cited Lcnin in speaking of
imperialism as the “highcst form of
capitalism". a system in which an im-
perialist nation allcdgcdly uses the
"supervprol‘its" it rips out ofcolonial
countrics to “bribe a sector ofits own
working class."

Baraka‘s Marxist rhetoric about
‘contradictions‘ and ‘thc dialectic'
was often exceedingly hard to
follow. In the question and answer
period after the lecture. a person ask-
cd Buraka il‘heshouldn‘ttryto make
his point of view more understan-
dable to his listeners. Baraka
somewhat lamcly replied that
propaganda isn‘t always understood
the “first time it is tried out."

Unfortunately this was insufficient,
especially in the pcrformuncy of
Brahms. where a rich and powerful
sound is needed.

T he major work of the program
was Johannes Brahms‘ Trio inC ma-
jor. The opening Allegro. though
agitated. ltickcd real color. Major
cnscmblc difficulties were evident
here too. A lack of richness in the
violin could be discerned in the An-
dante. though David Wells on cello
performed brilliantly. The final
allcgro perked up a bit. but too late
to save a generally lackluster perfor-
mancc.

The first half of the program con-
sisted of Locilett's Sonata for Violin,
Cello and Piano and Dvorak's Trio
