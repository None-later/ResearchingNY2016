‘ Edltor's 'N‘ote: SA President Steven DlMea
rent the following letter to Alberter Mayor
:,;_§ra.rttt.r Corning. ' .. A
, Daar Mayor Corning! ‘ 4

I can't begin to express to you just how

angered lam over the ﬁre that occurred at 48A

. Dove Street this post Wednesday.

V " Thank God no one was killed in this blaze
although a very serious injury was sustained
by a SUNYA student. What really causes my

I blood to boil is the lack of concern that this
city has shown over the‘ enforcement of its
housing codes. It simply appalls me to see that
this city government, which is supposed to
represent and protect the people of Albany.
only sbws a benign neglect for their welfare
and safety. The actions by the city in im-
proving and enforcing its housing codes
border on non-feasance. How many ﬁres of
this nature is the city of Albany going go have?
How many people have to lose their lives
before something is done? It‘s quite apparent
that the building at 48A Dove Street. as well as
other local buildings. do not meet the code
standards enacted by the city. Why have him
unless they are going to by enforced?

My God, I‘m an elected representative of
the student body. many of which (ap-
proximately 4.000) live in your city. I will not
tolerate any government or agency which is
negligent in their duties, especially when the
welfare and safety of these students are at

..«',. .. 

stake. ‘ '
.We. as students. are part of this community.

We arei'large ﬁnancial investors which in the .

end helps add to the city coffers. I spoke to you
before about the possibility of having Student
Dwellings Inc. take the initial steps toward in-
vesting in Albany. We would like to buy older
buildings. rehabilitate them with federal
funds, and then rent them out to students. We
have made outstanding progress in that area
and are now prepared to begin by buying two
buildings. We do care about the community.
We wish to preserve the rich historical heritage
of this ﬁne city. We also want to contribute to
the future of this city by showing people our
genuine support. All we ask from you is to
show the same faith and concern towards us.
as residents of Albany.

i wish to apologize for my rather blunt
feelings over this issue. However, I'm deeply
disturbed and troubled when such events.
which could have been prevented. take place.

Respectfully.

court action
' only hope

To the Editor:

l'd like to wish a speedy recovery to the six
persons injured in thc ﬁre at 48A Dove Street.
i would hope that SA and its lawyer offcrthc
students involved their fullest support in
bringing a civil suit for the apparent

‘

 

 

negligence of these landlords. I

A successful court action may well be off-
campus students' only signiﬁcant hope of
restoration of Albany rental units in com-
pliance with New York State building codes.
Our local authorities clearly seem to lack real
in bringing such corrective measures to pass.

If criminal proceedings are not brought in
regard to this tragedy, or if building inspec-
tions and improvements do not markedly in-

crease. I suggest that NYPIRG and others '

make Albany a target area for afﬁrmative ac-
tion on the inadequacy of student housing.
The health and safety of the community will
not be restored by apologies.

To the Editor:

There‘s a conspiracy on this campus. 0h. 1
know you haven't noticed. . . few have. You
see, it‘s an insidious sort of conspiracy. the kind
that seeps into your life. never drawing much
attention. just becoming a part. Before you
realize. you‘rc perfectly comfortable with it.
you begin to enjoy it. you actually take part in
a conspiracy against yourself! What is this in-
sidious conspiracy? l’uticnce . . . let me state
my case.

Have you ever noticed that early Thursday
evening. just when you are beginning to think
of a weekend spent in ardent study. you begin
to notice signs posted all over campus. per-
suasive signs. enticing signs. all coyly attemp-
ting to persuade your good-intentioncd. but
somewhat slothful. mind to let your studies
slip into the background just for a few hours?
Come to the movies. they say. come to the
theatre. come to the concert. come to relax. to
enjoy, to . . . Ah ha! They‘ve got you; all is
lost. Now, you‘ll stay up late. slccp late next
morning. and just when you‘re head begins to
clear. why. there are more signs. lots more.
promising bigger and better entertainment for
today. tonight. tomorrow . . .

Sometime Sunday night. you begin to comc
round . . . the lust of the signs. whose
promises have already entered the realm of the
past. blow around your feet. You hold your
aching. plcttsurc-stutkcd head between your
hands. and survey with tircd. blood shot eyes
the drcgs of a wasted weekend . . . notjust a
weekend. but another wcckcnd. another
weekend in an endless string of wasted
weekends. stretching back as far as your recl-
ing mind can remember. And tomorrow's
Monday. another Monday. A cold. clammy
chill runs down yourspinc. a vile taste rising in
your mouth. your palms begin to sweat. your
head spins . . . "cher again!" you scream.

Ah. butdecpdown. you know that scream is
hollow; unconsciuosly. you've already begun
to look forward to the next Thursday night

But I said conspiracy didn't I? 0h,ycsl Con-
spiracy it is! We've been had! This is no chance

reviewing your
expeﬁence

To the Editor:

A letter to "faculty. Students and Ad-
ministrators of the College of Arts and
Sciences.“ sent to all student organi/ations on
campus. has apparently not found Ils way to
the student body. since. at the date of this
writing (Nov. lit). not one single studcnt on
this campus has taken the opportuntty offered
by the “Prestdcnt's Special Committee to
Rcvicw thc Undcrgraduatc Expertcncc"tocx-
prcss an opinion on the futurc of ltbcrnl arts
education at the lintvcrstty at Albany.

For this reason. as chairperson of the Com—
mtttcc. I should like togtvc lhc students on lhlS
campus another opportuntty to tend the cw-n-
liul parts of the origtnal lettcr:

“This committee has been appotntcd by
President Fields to reassess the concept of a
liberal arts education at the l'ntvcntty ill
Albany.

"'1 he purposes of thts letter are. first. to seek

concepts." .

I believe the letter speaks for itself. It is a
bonajirle request for opinions and advice and
is in no way a device to favor any preconceived
approach. As a matter of fact. at the date of
this writing. the Committee has not yet taken
any position on the best way of producing a
liberally educated person.

Furthermore. the Committee will make its
report public at the same time it submits it to
President Fields. This is construed by both
President Fields and the Committee as proof
of the independence of its work.

Although the official deadline has passed. I
strongly urge you to take this opportunity to
shape your own future by offering your ideas
on what a liberal education should be. Please

Dollars For? Dwelling-s

Twenty thousand dollars of Student Association funds have been
earmarked for Student Dwellings, Inc., and will be used with other
monies to purchase and renovate a building or two for student housing.

With 15,000 students attending SUNYA, and a signiﬁcant proportion
affected by the housing crunch. the addition of housing for nine to 24

be part of a successful campaign to loosen the housing crunch.

An equal investment in lawyer‘s time would also help. If SA ﬁnanced
a series of lawsuits against local landlords who are defying various
regulations and ordinances. landlords throughout the capitol district
would pay heed to student housing problems. An investment in off-
campus services could be made to help off-campus students deal with
their landlords and with other housing problems. The Off-Campus
Student Association has created whole systems to serve these students.

helping those students \\ ho choose to live off campus.

Student Dwellings is a project that should have come from the
administration. but SA presently has available funds: the university
does not.

Student Dwellings also represents a committment to the community
by SA. showing the people of Albany that even though students may
come and go. they are willing to make a permanent investment in the
city.

Student Dwellings is a start; combined with other programs for off-
campus students it could instigate a much-needed renaissance in off-
campus living.

To the Editor:

I am writing tn response to Mitchell
Cantcr‘s letter of Nov. I! about my column.
"Normal Everyday Guys," Mr. Canter begins
by saying "Satire at the expense of others is
not funny." Apparently he docs not know that
thc deﬁnition of satire according to ll'cbrtt'r's

students in downtown Albany may not seem to be much of a dent in the ,

    
      
     

   
   
  
 

 

 

problem. By itself. such an analysis is correct, but Student Dwellings can ,

 

New ('ullt'gt'ulc Dictionary is "a literary work
holding up human vices and follies to ridicule
or scorn." lhrough sutirc. authors have
attempted to humoroust point out the absur-
dtttcs and rtdtculousncss of various people and
Inhlllulltll‘lh. l'hcrcforc. it is impossible to
write such a work without offending someone.

lhc thing I was poking llll'l at in nty article

 

was the letter I rcccived from [beta Xi Omega.
more so than the fraternity itself. If "a lot work
went into the writtng of that letter." as Mr.
Cuntcr states. then it wasn't enough. If i

rcccnc a lcttcr from an organiration asking é
me to join. and the lctlcr puts down people
who choose not to join because of their own
personal feelings. then that turns me off. and
certainly does not reﬂect kindly on the
organization.

Mr. Canter phoned me the day the article
was prtntcd to ask if I'd ever been to a frat par-
ty, When I said "no". he mumbled “ﬁnejour-
nalism“ and hung up. Since he did not ask
anything else about the article (such as why I
wrote it), and did not stay on the phone to dis-
cuss If. this can only lead me to believe he has a
closed mind and is not very interested in
somebody clsc‘s optnton.

Mr. ('ttntcr furthcr states that my article
