(AP) A frantic Week of signings has
depleted baseball's ‘ free agent
marketplace of some of its biggest
stars. but there still are some good
names available.

Nine free agents —— outfielders
Gary Matthews. Joe Rudi and Don
Baylor. pitchers Wayne Garland and
Don Gullet. catcher Gene Tenace
and infielders Dave Cash. Bert 9am-
paneris and Sal Bando — came to
terms last week. All except
Matthews and Bando were clients of

agent Jerry Kapstein.

Kapstein still is negotiating con-
tracts for inﬁelder Bobby Grich and
pitchers Rollie Fingers and Doyle
Alexander.

Also still looking for new homes
are slugger Reggie Jackson. who
spent the weekend in Montreal. talk-
ing with Expos club ofﬁcials. in-
ﬁelders Richie Hevner and Tito
Fuentes; and pitcher Steve Stone.
among' others.

The California Angels. who sign-

continued from page twenty
were good enough to play in tour-
naments last season. For example.
Plattsburgh. which according to
Sauers “has its whole team back this
year", won the NCAA Division III
East Regional title last year.

In January. the Danes will travel
to Florida to take on Rollins College
and St. Leo College. The former

.gave even “a team like North

Carolina State a good game." said
Sauers.

Persons with weak hearts should
avoid the gymnasium on December
28-29. That‘s the dates ofthe Capital
District Tournament. in which
Albany may face archrival Siena. If
tradition holds. the game will be a
nailbiter.

Gullett last week. _

Kapstein said Sunday that final
proposals for Grich were on the table
and the inlielder was “in the process
of finalizing his decision.“

Meanwhile. Kapstein concen-
trated on talks for Fingers. the 30-

year-old bullpen ace. When he signs.
he will be the sixth Oakland playerto
switch teams.

Jackson would have been a
seventh except the A‘s traded him to
Baltimore last spring in the deal that
brought Baylor to Oakland for one
season. '

Montreal made Jackson the open-
ing selection in the historic Nov. 4
free agent draft and spent the
weekend cajoiing the slugging out-
fielder. Before Jackson finished talk-
ing with the Expos and reportedly
took off for New York. Expos Chair—
man of the Board Charles Bronl‘man
said. “The discussions went very.
very well."

Dick Williams. Montreal's
manager. who was pilot of the A‘s
when Jackson played in Oakland.
said. “I feel quite confident we‘ll

have Reggiehere in Montreal."

After his talks with the Expos.
Jackson was scheduled to meet with
officials ofthe San Diego Padres and

anxious to get Jackson or Grich.
