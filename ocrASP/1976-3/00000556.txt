Varsity H00psters Have Depth

by Ed Moses

Last season. the Albany State var-
sity basketball team came perilously
close to having its first losing record
in its 21 years under head coach Dick
Sauers. It will be a disappointment if
a l976-77 crew with far greater depth
' and experience does not better last
year‘s l2-l I mark.

“At times we may play with one

guard." says Sauers. This is a reﬂec-
tion not of weakness but of strength.
for the Danes are stacked up front.

Senior Bob Audi. at 6‘2" is the
recently reelected team captain. As a
small forward, Audi has learned to
grab a rebound by boxing out his op-
ponent. He also picks up a lot of ‘gar-
bage baskets' by positioning himself
in the right place. A thoroughly solid
ballplayer. Audi was third on the
team last year in scoring. rebounding
and ﬁeld goal percentage.

Another 6'2“ forward with the
“smarts” is Vic Cesare, also a senior.
Cesare drew some twenty offensive
charging violations last year. and his
leaping ability (a 6‘5" high jump in
high school) makes him the team‘s
best rebounder. Percentage-wise. his
shooting was the sharpest.

At 6'3". Kevin Keane is another
relatively small forward. He‘s a ver-
satiie performer who can also play
center or guard. and led the Danes in
assists.

Intelligence and versatility can
only go so far, however. In a recent
scrimmage against Le Moyne
College, Albany's “biggest problem
was rebounding". admitted Sauers.
This problem. of course. stems from

the Danes' lack of big men. For the
Danes. the taller teams are going to
be tough.

Assistant Coach Bob Lewis feels
that “Staton Winston, will improve
our rebounding." Lewis adds.
however. that the 6'2" sophomore
needs more practice on his board
work. for he has a bad habit of
reaching for the ball with only one
hand. Winston can shoot as well as
leap: he led the junior varsity last
year in scoring. Sophomore Dave
Landry. standing at 6'3". rounds out
the Dane forwards.

The key man for Albany has to be
6‘7" center Barry Cavanaugh. who as
a freshman last year. paced the varsi-
ty with a 13.5 scoring average. The
team‘s tallest man. he provides the
inside scoring'threat. On offense, he
attracts attention. enabling his team-
mates to get free. On defense. he in-
timidates. as evidenced by his 29
blocked shots last season.

Cavanaugh must “keep out of foul
trouble.“ says Coach Sauers. and
“needs work on his defense.“ accor-
ding to Lewis.

Carmelo Verdcjo. a 6'3" soph, is
the second center. He‘s shown
promise in practice, and Sauers feels
"he could be a big surprise". Soph
Terry Miles. 6'5". is the other
middleman.

Albany‘s ‘point‘ guards, two line
ballhandlers who will direct the
offense, are Winston Royal and
Gary Trevett. Royal. another
sophomore at 5‘9“, is the smallest
member of the squad. Called up
from the jv at mid-season, he

proceeded to hit on an amazingMof
35 foul shots, including a school
record 28 straight. A real crowd-
pleaser. the ﬂashy Royal is ex-
ceedingly quick. Sauers says he has
the potential to develop into the
team leader.

Trevett. a 6'2“ senior, was out with

a broken wrist for a good part of last _

season. Albany‘s all-time assist
leader. Trevett was worely missed.
He‘s presently nursing a knee injury
which may keep him out of the
December 2 opening game against
Marist.

Trevett is needed to help direct the
“motion attack" the Danes will sport
this year. Look for screens and lots
of movement. as opposed to the
more set pattern of play used in the
past.

Another guard is 5’l0" soph Brian
Barker who as a freshman last year.
played in every varsity game. Senior
Mike Suprunowicz is the "gun" of
the backcourt; he's Albany‘s best
shooter. The S'll" guard averaged
over sixteen points a game until ——
like so many Danes last season — he
was sidelined with an injury.

Albany will be well off in terms of
experience. There are no freshmen
on this year‘s team. while four
seniors will return. One good thing
to come out of last year's injuries was
that several freshmen got varsity
playing time.

The Danes will need their ex-
perience. and should pray for few in-
juries. for their schedule is far from
easy. Seven of Albany's opponents

The Seventh Annual Great Dane
Swimming and Diving Relays were
held this past Saturday at University
Pool, and Coach Ron White's
aquamen ﬁnished fourth in the eight
team, four-year college division.

Albany‘s 66 points in the nine-
event program gave them their se-
cond best finish in the history of the

relay carnival. Coast Guard's l52‘

points paced the competition. Other
schools. in order of finish, were RPI.
Oneonta, Binghamton, New Paltz.
St. Michaels. and Keene State.
The Danes‘ best effort was the
300-yard butterfly. where co-
captains Paul Marshman and Mitch
Rubin teamed with Ed Watkins for a
2:569 time and a second place finish.
The team placed fourth in five
other relays: the 200<yard freestyle.
the BOO-yard backstroke. the 400-

yard medley, the BOO-yard freestyle.
and a meter diving relay. In twu
others. Albany was disqualified.
“However. if wouldn‘t have affected
our final standing." said Coach
White.

The coach was impressed with his
team‘s performance in light of the
fact that two ofhis key swimmers did
not compete. Bill Stockwcll. a
freshman, is taking time offafter tltc
junior varsity football season. and
will begin competitive swimming
after the Thanksgiving recess. The
backstroke events suffered from the
loss of freshman Mike McCann.
who will also return to action after
Thanksgiving.

Pups To Rely On Frosh

by Brian Owl
and Judy leenbaum

"We have the potential to win."
says junior varsity basketball Coach
Bill Austin. This year's squad con-
sists of thirteen players, all f reshmen.
who have never played together
before this season. The team's
success depends on their ability to
“work together as a unit."

Coach Austin does not see "any
major difference" between this year's
squad and last year's team. “I do not
compare in that way, “ he said.

Austin. rather, has his own
philosophy of choosing his team.
“When I pick a squad." he said. “I
choose thirteen players who can do
the job.“ This philosophy prohibits
him from choosing potential team
leaders or stars before the season
begins.

Thus far. the junior varsity has
played four scrimmages. Coach
Austin has used these “to get a team

together.“ He lccls he and his team
“have it lot of work to do.

“My aim is to develop players for
the varsity." said Austin. Last year
he accomplished his aim, as the
squad sent five players to the varsity.
This was “exceptionally good since
no varsity player graduated last
year," he said.

Austin. in his sqphomorc season
at State. felt he could not make
predictions on the outcome of the
season,ut this point in time. “Aftera
few games." commented Austin. "I
can tell better."

Potential

The one statement he made con-
coming the I’ups‘ chances this season
was. “We have some potentially
good huliplayers on this team. It is a
question of utilizing our talent."

The junior varsity basketball
season opens December 2. at home
against Marist as a preliminary to
the varsity contest.

Landlord Is Arrested In t 
Dove Street Fire Case

by Bryan Holsberg

Michael Rickman. part owner ofa
Dove St. residence where three
SUNYA students were injured in a
Nov. l7 fire. was arrested last week
for two housing code violations.

Rickman was charged with
violating a condemnation order and

Vwith not providing a sprinkler

system or fire escape as required by
state law for buildings with more
than three apartments.

“The building had been condemn-
ed in September I975." said City At-
torney .lohn Roe. “and a sign posted
visibly saying it was unfit for oc—
cupancy as uninhabitable and un-
safe." Roe said Rickman was told in
August I976 that there was to be no
occupation of 48A Dove St. as he
prepared for a September lease
transfer.

"I never got the ordinances from

Roe on the city property condemna-
tion," said Rickman. “There was no
sign. although I had known of it
when I bought the buildings.“

“I don't know when the sign came
down.“ said Roe.

According to Roe. City
authorities did not know people
were living in the building until the
fire occurred.

“The house had been condemn-
ed." said Roe, “and when the tire
trucks showed up people started
jumping out.“

Although he expects more charges
to follow. Roe said the City govern-
ment would probably not be held at
fault in any of them.

Members ofthe Albany Coalition
for Effective Code Enforcement said
City authorities knew of the
building's occupancy prior to the
fire. “Rickman had applied to the

Bell ofthe Coalition. “The Cityjust
had contact with him, they knew
what he was doing but they don‘t
keep records.“

Roe said Rickman could be lined
from $l0 to $2000 or be imprisoned

for 30 or both if found guilty ofthe
charges that have been leveled
against him.

According to Roe's interpretation
of the law. each day someone was liv-
ing in the building constitutes an
violation. “But we don‘t know how

Wellington Rooms Robbed During Recess

by Ed Moser

Two student residents at the Hotel
Wellington claim that valuable items
were stolen from their rooms over
the Thanksgiving recess.

Rick Cortreneo reported a stereo
receiver and two speakers missing.

A second student who wished to
remain unidentified said he returned
Sunday and found his amplifier.
color television set and turntable
cartridge missing.

The two estimated the combined
worth of the missing items at about
$1,400.

The matter is currently under in-
vestigation by Albany police. who
have interviewed the two students in-
volved and have searched their
rooms for fingerprints.

“It looks like an inside job to me."
said the anonymous student. who
stated he had his door double—locked
before leaving for the holidays. He
said that because the door was still
double-locked upon his return. the

thief must have had access to the
hotel master key.

The student threatened to“sucthe
city for negligence" pending the
results of the police inquiry.

Cortreneo also thought the alleg-
ed robbery was an inside job. “The
person knew exactly what he
wanted." he explained. "It looks like
he had lots of time. for my speaker
wires were not slashed.“ Cortreneo
said his room was not double-
locked.

Second Burglary

This was the second major
burglary at the Wellington in less
than a year. Over $2.000 worth of
student items were stolen during last
year's Christmas vacation break.

Director of Student HousingJohn
Welty said Thursday that he has
talked with the Wellington manage-
ment about the affair and has re-
quested a written report on the thefts
from Wellington Dorm Director
Fred Litt.

Welty said he would discuss with
the Wellington management how to
prevent further vacation thefts. He
added “double-locking is probably
the best way to insure againstthcft.

Lack of Security

The unnamed student was incens-
ed over what he termed lack of
security at the Wellington. He said
an elderly guard employed “for in-
surance purposes only." was the
hotel's only security.

The student claimed that despite
last year's major robbery and a series

of petty thefts throughout this
semester. the management failed to
provide adequate protection for stu-
dent poscssions.

Student residents at the
Wellington can request that their
doors be double-locked.

The Wellington management paid

an insurance adjustor had assessed

Rickmiin said the three student
residents had been living in the third
Iloor apartment of the building for
l7 days before the‘ fire broke out.
The student residents were George
DeLucu. Monica Leonards. and
Ellen Deutschman.

Deutschman had complained to
Tony Cheh of the United Tenants of
Albany and to Rickmaii about
heating problems inthc buildingtwo
weeks before the fire. Chch said
Deutschman hild not complained to
City officials for fear of retaliation
from Rickman.

A total ofsix people were injured
in the fire. Deutschmtin was listed in
fair condition yesterday at Albany
Medical Center where she is
reportedly being treated for
separated pelvic bones and other
fractures suffered in a fall from the

Mission Replies Are Processed

by Jonathan Hodges

A four-page report. representing
the summation of sixty responses to
the SUNYA Statement of Mission,
will be submitted to the Educational
Policy Council of the
University Senate
Amlym within the next two

weeks.

The report. compiled by El’C‘s
Long-Range Planning Committee.
groups the sixty replies into six
general categories and recommends
nine possible changes in the docu-
ment.

For the most part. the committee's
report deals in generalities rather
than specifics. it recommends that
the goals set forth for SUNYA in the
document be summarized. but only
vaguely outlines what should be in-
cluded in the section.

University Reamrmed

At the top ofthe list was acull fora
rcal'firmution of the concept ofa un-
iversity and a need to stress
SUNYA‘s desire to grow. The only
specific suggestion was to update a
passage in the mission statement
dealing with academic freedom that
was written in I9IS.

In a memo sent in August to Assis-
tant to the President Robert Shirley
by the Planning Committee before
the mission statement was released
for general circulation. the com-

News

mittee outlined their feelings on
what the statement should contain.
Those recommendations are similar
to the ones being presented now.

The memo stated that “the con-
cept ol a University and the role of
the University at Albany as it Univer-
sity Center needed to be clearly
stated.”

Now that committee states that
the mission statement should include
it “commitment to and rcul'firmation
of the concept of a University" and a
"declaration ofthe special properties
of it University Center.“

Academic Freedom

In the August memo to Shirley.
tiic committee stated that “a com-
mitment to the concept of academic
lrcedoui must be explicit in the mis-
sion statement.“

i‘our months later the committee
recommends that the revised mission
statement include it "commitment to
academic freedom."

The memo cited that “the new
commitment to public policy
analysis needs to be clearly outlined
to the university community."

In the committee's latest report.
the second recommendation is to
"isolate and set off the discussion of
public policy analysis to stress and
express more cleariythe fact that it is
to be an addcdelemcnt to the univer-
sity."

llascd on this new report. which
could constitute a major part of the
EI’C's final recommendation for
revision of the mission statement.
the same questions raised four
months ago concerning the state-
ment have yet to be answered.

A few new ideas that are contained
in the committee's report are verbose
and buried amidst coils for
clarifications and deletions in the
mission statement. The fifth
recommendation. for Instance, calls
lor the faculty to wield a significant
share of the power in governing
SUNYA. It reads: "The importance
to the University of collegiality of
locally participation both in current
governance and determining the
luture directions of the U niversity."
