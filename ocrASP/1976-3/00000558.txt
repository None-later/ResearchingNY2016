ALBANY STUDENT PRESS . DECEMBER'a. 1978

 

by Beverly Hearn -

President Field's. Special Com-
mittee to Review the Undergraduate
Experience is seeking feedback on
what students feel constitutes a well—
rounded liberal arts education ac—
cording to a letter released by Com-
mittee Chairperson Ray Ortuli.

According to Ortali. the student
should “never use the word ‘require‘
ment‘ " because instituting distribu-
tion requirements is only one possi-
ble solution to a complex
educational problem.

Student comtnittee member Ira
Zimmerman said any changes in
SUNYA's' requirements would not
affect students already enrolled. 0n
the subject of distribution re-
quirements. Zimmerman said. “We
want students to get a good educa-
tion. bttt lorcing ll student is not the
answer."

Ammcrman wants to see innova-
tion so that merely grades don't get
students "honors". lie thinks that
what should also cotuid is having a
distinguished assortment of courses.
One example he mentioned is the
course in the world food crisis. This
course is interdisciplinary and is
taught by professors from different
departments I-Ie reasoned that it a
student can do well in this cottrse. ltc
must be well rounded. lie further
adds. “it distribution requirements
are the ultimate answer. then I hope
there is a bloody fight over it.“

 

Committee to.SeelcErl Critéinai

are from students. They expect that ‘

Hajimu Ogawa. a faculty member
on the committee. said. “I think that
there is a lot ofrmcrit in-having astuf
dent get a broad education—I think
having students experience breadth
in educationvis valuable but l'm not
convinced that requirements are a
way to accomplish that.”

He explained that in the 60‘s,
because of student unrest. many
schools gave up liberal arts re-
quirements in order to give students
more freedom. Now. some students.
are taking a much more nalrowly
trained approach than perhaps they
would have been under a more strict
requirements situation. Students are
more concerned about preparing
themselves for a career. Dr. Ogawa's
experience in counseling students lies
in the lield of computer science.

Review of the undergraduate ex- ,

perience started with the CAP
(Committee on Academic
Programs) for the College of Arts
and Sciences. Later. the College of
Arts and Sciences suggested that
I‘ields appoint CAl' members to the
“President‘s Special Committee to
Review the Undergraduate Ex-
perience." Their previous experience
with undergraduate education was
cited as reasons for their appoint-
ment.

So tar. the committee has been
reading letters sent them by faculty
and administrators. They have
received l5 letters to date. but none

there will be some student response
after the committee develops
proposals for improving lun-
dcrgraduate education.

The committee doesn‘t have a
deadline for coming up with a plan
for SUNYA.

The committee has looked at a
I975-76 report by Yale University's
President Kingman Brewster. Com-
mittee member Ira Zimmerman
ntentioncd Yale‘s continuing con-
cern over liberal education. Zimmer-
man explained that the committee is
taking advantage ol'any information
that comes their way. According to
him. “we are ready to consider un-
conventional ways of fulfilling a
rather conventional goal."

SUNY Budget Shows Increase

The State University's l977-l978
budget request culls fora $61 million

increase. largely to cover inflation

and increased debt service payments
on further SUNY construction bon-
dings.

The Trustees recommend. in their
approved request now to he sent to
the Governor. that the State increase
its support $22 million to offset the
debt service payments.

The State must act on the $22

million SUNY request bycither rais-
ing students costs approximately
S Hill, appropriating the $22 million.

cutting the University‘s base budget"

by that amount. or some combina-
tion of these three solutions.

The speculation is that prospects
for a real budget increase are poor
and further cutbacks may be likely.
Tuition and room rent were raised
$l00 each this year. producing $42
million in income offset revenues.

which. when added to the actual $9
million state support slash for this

The problem lies in the l977-78

The debt service remained for this
