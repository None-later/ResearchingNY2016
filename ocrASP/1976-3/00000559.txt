a Catholic Church on West 42nd

demand a measure requiring that
parking lots be closed at night to

Representatives of'the parking lot
industry opposed the proposal to
close the lots with gates or chains,
saying only a few. if any, of the city's
l,200 lots were being used for
prostitution.

BABY BOOM

Federal police in Argentina have
arrested an obstetrician and IS
medical technicians who have been
doinga booming business in the sale
of newborn babies.

According to Pacific News Ser-
vice. the infants sell for $1000 to
$2000 each. and are transferred to
the buyers at birth and registered as
the natural children of the new
parents.

Argentina has an active infant
black market because of high un-
employment and the need for money
among its peasants. The country's
birth rate is now one of the lowest in
Latin America.

MILITARY EDSELS

You've heard about all those
weapons the Pentagon has
stockpiled that can destroy the entire
world many times over.

Well. now. ()ui magazine in an ar-
ticle titled "Military Iidsels.“ is out
WIII‘I a list of the most recent tnililary

DULL SEX LIFE

Reports that turkeys have dull sex
lives are untrue. As a matter of fact.
the turkey growers association says
that turkeys have no sex lives at all.

It turns out that all breeding is
done by artificial insemination.
often after turkey hens and toms
have been matched by computer.
Sex is banned in the turkey pens
because an amorous 50-pound tom
would crush the rib cage of a 20-
pound hen.

STERILITY

The U.S. Government‘s Indian
Health Service performed steriliza-
tion operations on 3400 American
Indians. reportedly without telling
many patients that the operation was
not necessary. and without ob-
taining their proper consent.

The General Accounting Office
(The U.A.0.) issued a report this
week on the sterilizations after con-
ducting an investigation into the
sterilizations of native Americans at
the request ol'South Dakota Senator
.Iames Abourezk. Abourezk said he
had asked the (i.A.0.. the watchdog
agency of Congress. to look into the
matter after receiving numerous
complaints that Indian women Were
being sterilized as a birth control
procedure without their consent or
knowledge.

LOST BOMB

‘ If you happen tosee a I ZOO-pound
nerve gas bomb lying- around
somewhere. the United States Army
would be very pleased if you Would
let them know about it.

The Rocky Mountain Arsenal in
Denver revealed this week that. after
a three-year effort. army demolition
experts had finally detoxified all of
the nerve gas bombs being stored in
the Denver area.

According to the official report.
exactly 2 l .I I4 bombs were
neutralized. The problem is that the
Army's official inventory states that
there should have been exactly 2t.-
ll5 nerve gas bombs—«not 2l.| l4 ~
in stock. The Army admits that. for
some unknown reason. it is one
bomb short.

 

A spokesperson at the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal insists it is “high-
ly improbable" that anyone removed
one ol the l-200-pound bombs from
the high security areas in which they

were stored. The Army is writing off

the missing bomb as an “inventory
error.“

CELL AND BOARD

The State of Michigan. in a
bizarre move. has filed suit against a
prison inmate in an attempt to
collect room and board for his stint
in jail.

The Michigan Attorney (ieneral‘s
Office has filed the action against in-
mate Charles From. who was con—
victcd recently of receiving stolen
property.

According to the suit. under the
rarely used “l’rison Reimbursement
Act at 1935." the state may require
reasonable well-to-‘do inmates to pay

prison. t‘riim. needless to say. has
