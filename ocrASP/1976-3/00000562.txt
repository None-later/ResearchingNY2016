By DAVID COHEN

The question of whether por-
nography corrupts has become a
scientific issue. In a society where
there are no clear moral or sexual
standards that everyone accepts. the
arguments for banning or restricting
pornography tend to become em-
pirical. Does it do harm? Or does it
do good'.’ The wholc premise of the
argument on pornography has been
that one can show it huscleur effects.
be they good or bad. and that thesc
are demonstrable.

This is obviously an almost impos-
sible question to answer. ls the mot-
or cur good or bud? This might puss
muster us a question designed to
prod discussion in a seminar but no
serious diulogue could really be cast
in such simplistic terms.

clinical psychologist from the Royal
Adclﬂidc Hospital in Australia who
has made a reputation us the mun
who has “provad” that pornography
corrupts pcoplc.

In February Court came to Britain
to bc an expert witness in the
Snurchrook trial. where the
publisher of a consldcrublc amount
of sudomutmcltisfic matcriztl was be-
ing proscculcd. Differing
diumctricully with other expert
wilncsscs. Court not merely denied
the defense claim that such material
was lhcrupcutlc but argued that it
could actually dumugc people. The
prosecution won. perhaps largely
thanks to Court‘s evidence.
Afterward the Daily Mail inter-
vicwcd him and used the headline.
"ch. Pornography Docs Corrupt
and I've l’rovcd It." Court says the
headline mlldt.‘ him wince. Hc rcjccts

during precisely those years the level
of sexual offenses declined
significantly. Kutchinsky‘s work
suggested. moreover. (but the cause
of this dccllnc was fairly directly the
liberalization of the porn luws. Sex-
uully disturbed men could use very
"hard" pornography material to fan-
tasize and so did not have to commit
notions that would be offenses.
Court‘s work begun with u rccx-
umimuion of those statistics. He
found thut a number of l‘uctors cast
doubt on Kulchinsky‘s correlations.
First of all. during the period he
covcrcd a number of acts-'
especially homosexual oncs wceuscd

analysis. Court claims. took no ac-
count of that. Second. during the
study the population ofCopcnhagcn
l'cll roughly from 700.000 to 600.000.
The rule of'crimc pcr l00.000 did
not full so significantly—and the rate
of serious sex crimes such as rape
and uttcmpled‘r‘ape did not full at all.
While minor crimes like cx-
hibitlonism und voyeurism declined.
Court maintains that an analysis
shows that serious crimes actually
increased. Rape and attempted rape
went from six per 100.000in I967 to
ten per I00,000 in I972. Also.tficcx-
tent to which offenses were reported

 

rate on the one hand. and tight por-
nography laws and a lower sex crime

rate on the other. In Singapore. for

example. the laws are light and thc
rulcof tape but; held steady at three
per I00.000 from I963 to I972. In
Tokyo. where the police are up-
purcntly very efficient. pornography
is tightly controlled and the rule of
rape has gone down from twclvc pcr
l00.000 in I962 to eight per |00.000
in I972.

ll tight luws reduce the rate of
serious sex crime. Court claims his
data show lhlll llhcratl 11th incrcusc
ll. Analyzing figures from Britain.
the U.S.. Australia. New Zculund.
Fruncc. Denmark. and Sweden. he
found 2! similar undcrlylng trcnd in

became more available. us the laws
became more libcrnl. so rape and
attempted rupc incrcuscd-und at a
more rapid rate thutuscrious crimes

the increase inrapc and attempted
rape both as a gross figure and also

in relation to other crimes of

violence. The gross increusc is nearly
always dramatic but becomes much
less dramatic when compared with
other crimes of violence.

Court concedes that sex crimc

“It is not my job to decide what
can and cannot be read." he uyt.
“That is the politician's task. The
evidence shows that there ls a steep
increase in crime and this suggests
that some curbs are called for. But it
is for the politicians to decide the
balance of good and harm. I‘m not
for a prohibition attitude but I am
not persuaded that u large number of
people benefit or that this outweighs
the overt harm done or the level of
offense given."

To be not pcrsuudcd is perfectly
lcgitimat '2 it is a different matter to
have evidence that the level of good
outweighs the harm. First. no one
knows how much help scxuully cx-
