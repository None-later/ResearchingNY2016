tlie‘peculiir refractive properties. of
this mist, the‘light from thetwo suns

blended museum imparted a dif-

fuse green glow to  aura about the
planet. This emerald shroud was a
most fitting garment. as the Virgin's
verdant surface abounded with
teeming life. Sheets of green foliage
encased this world. Multitudes of
rodent-like creatures skittered
between thick treetrunlts engorged

across tawny plains. bearing fan-
tastically intertwined antlers atop
their heads. Veiled in a tenuous
green blanket. the planet spun about
a pair of suns that had never warmed
a man.

Silently. the engines of the Gypsy
belched forth their last remaining
drops of fuel.

Leaning back in his chair,the man
glanced at the ship's indicators. The
enumerable rows of dials. levers. and
lights informed him that all had gone
as planned. His eyebrows raised
slightly. and with lips drawn tight. he
coldy complimented his ex-
ecutioncrs‘ efficiency.

On a world renowned for meting
out both elaborate and inescapable
forms of punishment for criminal
offense. the man had been declared
an irreformable outlaw. His exotic
fate had been conceived by an excep-
tionally imaginative panel ofjudges.
He was locked inside a tiny space

The manI while living on his home

‘world. had at one time received

trainin'g in the design and construc-
tion' of. space vehicles. He found
himself somewhat familiar with the
rows of intricate devices lining the

interior of the spacecraft. He wished . .

that he were able to examine these
indicators more closely. but the
possibility of free movement was
precluded by the presence of bulky
banks of complex machinery jutting
out at him. He recalled that the type
of craft in which he was now im-
prisoned was basically intended to
operate within close proximity to a
planetary body. As such, it should
possess a gauge of sorts indicating
the ship's altitude above the ground,
as this information would be re-
quired by the pilot.

Minutes later. his eyes narrowed
on a luminous orange disc whose
periphery was calibrated in units of
distance. A sharply tapered needle
extended across the radius. He had
found the altimeter. He gazed fixed-
ly at the pointer. determining its ex-

provided the. rhythm to accompany
his cursing. His fellowmen had been
thoughful enough to include a
spacesult (through no act of charity;
it was certainly an oversight). This
made little difference. as he was now
well within the gravitational ﬁeld of
the Virgin. Even if he were able to
leave the ship, he would only follow
it in his fatal plunge.

An unmarked button caught his
attention. He remembered that years
ago. when his people were at war.
many ships carried information and
equipment which were never intend-
ed to fall into enemy hands. Slowly.
the function ofthc button occured to
him. A while ago. the thought ofin-
tentionally destroying himself was
inconceivable. but he had known
once ofa ship belonging to his world
which had lost all power while or-
biting some planet. it had begun to
plummet into the atmosphere. Fric-
tion with the air had heated the in-
terior until the metal within the ship
softened and flesh burnt and crack-
ed. He had heard u transmission
received from the doomed ship.
before the heat had caused the radio
aboard the ship to explode. For a
time after. nightmares razed his sleep
as visions of blackened hands fused

and the violent roekln “till! would

operative. _

He hunched back wearin in his
chair. Something ran down his
forehead. slid down his nose, and fell
upon his wrist.

Sweat. lie was sweating.

The ship had entered the at-
mosphere and air friction was
heating the cabin. As he approached
the massive planet. the gravitational
attraction increased quickly. He
accelerated faster and faster. the
temperature rising rapidly. The
stabilizing fins protruding from the
rear of the spacecraft glowed red.
then orange . . . orange-white . . .
one broke off.

He flipped on the viewing screen
and rccoiled as his linger touched the
bot switch. Electronic cackle greeted
him as the screen struggled to life.
Below. herds of grazing animals
peered upwards to watch the
shooting star. Trees bowed to the
breeze and birds looking somewhat
like miicaws scattered in the air. He
almost hit one as it swung to avoid
him.

and disappeared. one in-
distinguishable from the next. Urey
blobs grew to lill the screen. It
snapped off. The steady orange light
that had been illuminating the in-
struments was replaced by a flicker-
l'ng redness as flames now backlit the
panel.

His breath flowed like hot liquid
down his throat. He ripped off his
helmet. The transparent faceshield
had begun to melt. Scorching shards
ol‘molten material rained iiboiil him.
His arm instinctively flew up to
guard his face and he struck the
