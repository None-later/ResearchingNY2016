. country’s human resources." We are happy to

hear of this change in policy and hope that Mr.
Scherbenlro will soon inform the Soviet Union
of it, since their actions prove that they know
nothing’ofsueh a policy. On the contrary, peo-
ple who'ask for freedom to immigrate to Israel
are punished by the Soviet 'Union. They are
harassed, ﬁred from their jobs. and in many
cases. sent to labor camps.

In reference to the refugee issue which Mr,
scherbenlto mentioned. it should be pointed
out that it was the Mufi of Jerusalem and the
other Arab' leaders who were the creators. of
this problem.’ It is because oftheiractions that
the Palestinians, left. when Israel urged them
to remain in their homes. Many Jews have_

. been. and are still being. forced to flee from.

Arab lands. However. we do not see reports
about the Jewish refugee problem because
Israel strives to absorb them as quickly as
possible and at her own cost. 0n the other
hand. the Arabstates have let their refugees re-
main in refugee camps so that this false issue
may be kept alive.
We have now pointed out many of the un-
truths which ifill Tom Scherbenko's article.
The last one that we will deal with is his com—
plaint concerning Student Association fun-
ding; a complaint that he has raised previous-
ly. The fact that Tom Seherbcnko is a writer
for the ASP leads one to believe that he
respectsthc value ofa newspaper. It is not only
a vehicle forairing opinions but also should be
read to learn the facts and opposing view-
points. In our letter. 'Culture. Not l’olitics'.
which appeared in the Sept. 28 issue of the
ASI'. we dealt with this complaint regarding
SA funding. If Mr. Scherbenko was really
concerned about seeking the truth. tlterc
would be no need for us to once again state the
facts. for he would have read the letter. To
quote from that letter. "since SA does not fund
political or religious activates. rm SA funds
are used for these types of~events.~" Further-
more, “SA funds support programs ranging
from student visits to senior citi/cns. having
llebrcw bands on campus. to organi/ingn per-
forming dance group. to educating people
about World Jewry and Israel.“ It is this kind
of cultural and educational experience that
Israel Awareness Week presented.

why not
snobs?

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to an oracle which
appeared in your Nov. 23rd issue entitled
“liuk-a-l’oos. Bagels. Nose Jobs and
l’oodles."Apparctitly. the author. Robert Ii.
GHQ/Jr” is a living example of a flourishing
“Meier of called "higots." It is sad that this
species is still not extinct. particularly iti an in-
stitution of education such as this one.

Mr. (fray realires his own prejudices by say-
ing that “JAI’S come in a wide range. uttd that
they are not limited to any one race or
religion". However. his facade is easily
destroyed when one reads the rest of his
article.

However. his facade is easily destroyed when
one reads the rest of his article.

Firstly. why did Mr. Gray choose the word
“JAR” to incorporate the characteristics he
enumbetatcs‘.’ Why not use the term "snob" or
"Spoiled. vain person"? If the person is
Catholic and snobby. should we call them
"CAl’s“’l If they‘re Protestant. should we call
them “I'Al’s'”! If they are Buddhist. “llAl’s‘”?
What is they are Protestant rind come from
Ireland—«lo we call them "l’ll’s'"! Suppose
lth are a Catholic who comes frotn Russia

 

and they are Americanired do we call them
"CRAI’s"? Of course. this all sounds nonsen-

sical and it is meant to inorder to illustrate the I
silliness and bigotry in labeling all snotty peo-
ple ‘JAPs“.

secondly. according to the article, only
females are snotty. spoiled people. Gray
makes references to Cover Girl. mascara.
“battered women," etc.. which can lead the
reader to believe that only women fit into the
category he describes. Certainly, many men fit
this description as well. -

Thirdly. to return to Mr. Gray's assertion
that “JAP” can apply to any race or religion.
why does he refer to “JAPs” with “eight inch
chais“ or why does he associate “JAPs” with
bagels‘.’ In referring to SUNYA as a haven for '
“JAPs” why does Mr. Gray indicate that
SUNYA stands for “Send Us No Young
Arabs"? The answers to these questions are
obvious. Suffice it to say. by claiming the term
“JAI’” can apply to anyone regardless of race
or religion. and then by indicating otherwise in
his article. Mr. Gray is one of the genus
"hypocritical" and of the species "bigot."
Hopefully. this creature will soon vanish from
the face of the earth. The sooner the better.

guns
on campus?

To the Editor:

Communication. or rather the lack of it.
That is the true source of an issue on campus
which is now only potentiallydangerous. That
issue is whether or itot the university police
force should artncd withhaitdguiis.

This is a difficult problem to ' pprottcli. for
ilic group most affected by the ﬁnal decision.
the student body. is faced with a dilemma.
When formulating an opiition. do we consider
such factors as the recent series of rapes. thus a
need for crime prevention. or do we consider
ilic potential danger of arminga security force
tn an atmosphere of uncertainty?

As far as most students are concerned.
security is around to ticket our cars. show up
after lire alarms and occasionally hasle us
around the perimeter. ()ur security force is un-
familiar to its as we are to them. This un-
familiarity crcatcs uncertainty and the uncer-
tainty breeds fear.

Therein lies the potential danger of the
issue. We must anticipate situations on carn-
pus, whether they involve one or two people in
II titttiot tttctdetu or it group III a dctlltlllsll'il-
tioti. that Will lorec aseeurlty officer to make a
quick decision; to act Without the use of a
weapon or to draw his gun and perhaps fire. In
this present atmosphere of f'earaiid uncertain-
ty. would you want security to have that op-
tioti'l

Anti let us not cloud tliis’lssue liycquating it
Willi Kent State. flie Iwosttuationstirctotally
different in nature anti the only flung they
might wuid up ilIIVIIlg in common is an un-
nceeessaty shooting. which is is enough in
common to scare the shit otit of anyone here.

I urge the committee dealing with the
problem. and President l‘telds. to consider
this comiiitititcaitonal aspect. arid to invite
students to participate in the decision-titaking
process. I also recommend that the ad-
ministration provtde for opportunities for
students and security to interact in tlll-
pressured situations. Let's get to know each
other before the only thing between us but gun
barrel.

Guns Under Fire- ;  -

 

>_,,_, ;  .,..WV‘V.

The possession'and patential- use of ﬁrearm by SUNYA-“s Public“
Safety Department is once again a campus issue. The anti7g‘iiri- faction: .
advocates no'guns at all. Thepro-gun factiOn supports the arming of all.
officers. But neither of these extreme positions representAthe best
solution. -'  ' ' ‘

A totally, unarmed police'force means free reign" for anybody 'on

.' campus with a gun. An officer cannot be expected to confrontan armed

criminal with a wooden elub. True. the‘AIbany- City ’Policercan be
summoned for armed support. but‘by the time they arrive innocent" "
people may already be dead. Emergencies tend to have" a‘certain
immediacy about them. v

The arming of all campus police officers doesn't make sense either,
simply because there are many daily routines and activities undertaken
where there is no need to bear arms. For an ofﬁcer issuing parking
tickets or directing traffic, the possession of a gun would only encourage
its misuse.

Clearly, students want to be protected. Yet some students fear that the
police mightuse guns against them. But students cannot allow their
wariness of armed police to override concern for the danger posed by
unchecked, armed criminals on the SUNYA campus.

Without question, there are situations which can arise on campus
where police will be unable to protect the public without the aid of
firearms. Uuns are readily available in our society, and are frequently
used in the perpetration of criminal offenses. At the same time, there is
no guarantee that police will never misuse guns. After all, they are
human beings, capable of irrational or mistaken judgements.

'l'he horns of this dilemma are difficult to grapple with, thus the best
solution is to between them. SUNYA‘s firearm policy should be tailored
to make guns readily accessible to qualified campus police officers when
the need for them is clearly justified, but keep armed police away from
students as much as possible.- Guidelines for the bearing of guns by

‘gcamm‘is of‘ficers'rfedef'ining when and where they mayvbejrarried~must

be formtilat'ed and strictly enforced.

The goal here is to maximize public protection while minimizing the
risk involved in providing that protection. The total disarmament of
campus police hinders the former cause, while total armament works
against the latter. The controlled arming of campus police is the best
means for achieving this end.
