“You realize that from now 'til Christmas
(Keep the X In Xmas. a bumper sticker rid-
inonisbes) it'll be pure hell." he says to me as
the fifth garage bus drives past us. waiting at
the circle. “This is like waiting for Godot,"
someone mutters and everyone ignores the all
too familiar simile. “Here we have a circle.
perfect. but empty.“ he continues. We are all
gazing towards Colonial. having forgotten
that a watched bus never comes. It is the most
joyous of seasons and the worst part of the
semester. Soon we will be swallowing black
beauties whole, as We never quite did the fairy
tale. l rim makinga list ofthings to do aiida list
of options. I am always making lists and then
losing them. The tirst item on the next list i
make is always “I. Find old list.“ I will omit
the things to do. as it is more titan likely that
you too have lifty thousand pages of reading
(or underlining. it you are in the social
sciences). tlteii papers and exams. and if you
don‘t. l don‘t want to hear about it 7 misery
toying company and all that.

This is the season so reminiscent of a word.
a word you alive used your whole life. not
French or anything like tlitit just a word
witliorit thinking you‘ve used it and someone
asks you “What does that word mean?“ You
say. “liuh'!” the person repeats his ’lrer ques-
tion.Yoirsrr\."\\’ell.rili. .Iitllt‘llltstlh. . 
You know \\ but it means. you irate heeri using
it at least since your lrrst SA | s. It is the only
appropriate word in this coiite\t tltat you

define it for this obviously sincerely ignorant
person? Wait. how can you be certain of his
sincerity or ignorance. . .surely be (he/she)
'is familiar with it . . . surely they who have
been moaning "We've all been socialized" all
semester. surely they know . . .

That's the way I feel right now. Love is buta
footnote. and everything requires cross
references. Options? As the sixth garage bus
passes as I hear several. “I’m goingto drop out
and go to Denver." Suicide is mentioned.
Arizona. Lying about a death in the family.
Dropping out and going to Denver is no
solution—the mountains looked better on
your Sierra Club posters. all the Denver pop-
ulace is bummed-out New Yorkers and
remember the reason you're here is so you can
get out with a degree. Suicide‘.’ Wasn't l’lath a
suicide and wait 'til you rerrlile you've nothing
to do New Year's Eve. Arizona? Do you
honestly (or dishonestly. which is probably
cheaper) want to live with people who tilt in

And besides. you killed oil your nuclear fami-
