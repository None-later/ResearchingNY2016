.Jockettes Take 'WIRA Crown Again

by Joe Tackle '

The Jockettes of the WIRA Flag
Football League have for the second
consecutive season captured the
W IRA Championship. The
Jockettes did it going away, finishing
the season undefeated. 7-0. including
a pre-season scrimmage. In their last
two years. the Jockettes have not lost
a football game. All total the
Jockettes scored a record 243 points
offensively. while defensively allow-
ing a mere 62 points.

Strange'Competitlon

The Jockettes clinched the cham-

pionship during the fourth game of

the season. Though novictory was
achieved by a margin less than six
points, the Jockettes faced tough
competition against the teams
“Afternoon Delight” and "Strange."

The explosive offense was led by

senior running backs and co-V

captains Nancy "Touchdown" Paf-
frath and Norine “Broken Nose“
Karst. A combination of Paffrath‘s
running and Karst's blocking and
pitching sprung a running game
which often controlled the tempo of
a game.

When it wasn’t l’affrath and
Karst. Sherri Zimet took charge,

playing both split end and run-
ningback in place of Karst. Sherri‘s
excellent blocking and pass-catching
turned short gains into long ones. If
the defense keyed on Pafl'rath and
Karst. the team had the option of go-
ing to Zimet.
Skipper Granitski

Quarterback Kathy Granitski‘s
passing and ball—handling skills
directed the offense. Opening large
holes and protecting the quarterback
during the season was the “un-
movable force" of Kyle Lucy,
Phredd Kunz. Katie MacUowan and
Leah Zal‘ran.

Plattsburgh“ . _

Defendingchampion Plattsburgh.
returning the entire starting team
that finished fourth in last March‘s
NCAA Division III national tourna-
ment. heads the list of contenders for
the I976-77 State University of New
York Athletic Conference
(SUNYAC) basketball pennant. Ac-
cording to pre—season forecasts by
conference coaches, Albany, Oneon-

ta. and Brockport will be the Car- '

dinals‘ closest pursuers, with several
other teams rated as “dark horses."

Coach Norm Law rallied his
Plattsburgh team from a slow start
lasy year to win the SUNYAC title
with it 9-l mark. sweep through the
NCAA East Regionals, and defeat
the New England representative,
before losing twice in the‘national
finals. Among the rcturneesthis year
are All-SUNYAC performers Larry
Parker and Ron Wright. plus five
other lettermen.

Parker, is 6‘6 junior. was the
leading conference rebounder (17.2)
and fifth in scoring(I7.7). Wright. a
guard. led SUNYAC scorers with a
2|.9 average. The Cardinal‘s only-
conlercnce loss a year ago was by
nine points at Oswcgo. They clinch-
ed the title with a final-game win
over runner-up Onconta.

Onconta. 8-2 a year ago. lost con-
ference MVP and number two

SUNYAC scorerSteve Blackmon
(2|.7) through graduation.
However. Coach Don Flewelling has
eight lettermen back and should
have the quickest team in the con-
ference. Oneonta‘s strength is its
guards. led by playmaker Kevin
Croutier and Ralph Christian. Joe
Lewis and Carl Mabry head a less-
settled frontcourt. The Red Dragons
play four SUNYAC games in the
season's first II days. '

Despite the loss of nine lettermen,
Brockport coach Mauro Panaggio is
optimistic. His hope. and opposing
coaches‘ fears. stems from the infu-
sion of such newcomersaso‘B Chuck
Haskins. 6‘7 Steve Boettcher and 6'3
Joe Porcelli. among others. He also
has 6‘8 Kevin Williams. who sat out
last year. With so many new faces.
Brockport gets a schedule break in
that its first conference game isn't
until Jan. 22. nine games into the
season.

Last year‘s surprise team was the
previous season‘s cellar-dweller. Os—
wego. which finished fifth at 5-5 and
posted victories over Plattsburgh
and Albany. Coach Bernard Boozer
has back 6’3 Jim Boson and 6‘4 Bill
Thicben, both second team, All-
SUNYAC. Bason averaged I7.0 ppg
(sixth in SUNYAC) and 8.3
rebounds (fifth). while Thieben‘s

2L4 scoring average was the con

ference‘s third best. Four other key '

players return. giving Booler a
veteran club that could challenge for
the top this time: around.

Starters Out

The unexpected loss of two
starters rocked Geneseo. All-
SUNYAC Mark Klein, the con-
ference's fourth leading scorer
(l8.8). left school for academic
reasons. while team MVP-Steve
Hemenway, the No. 4 SUNYAC
rebounder (9.2). is ineligible to play.
They led the Blue Knights to a 4-6.
tied for seventh. ﬁnish a year ago.
Coach Tom Pope, a winner all seven
years at (.ieneseo. must blend six
lettermen with several newcomers.
The top veterans are senior guards
Glenn Whalen and Kevin Canty. 6'7
center Pat Moriarty. and forward
Paul Tubinis. The best-looking
rookie is 6‘3 Kevin Westfall, a
transfer forward.

Potsdam has its top six scorers
back from last year's youthful.
rebuilding team that went 3-7. One
of the victories was an upset of
Albany. Bob Ulrich. Ron Ezzie,
Charles Richardson. Paul Meade.
and Paul Hardy are the top
returnees. Tom Hutchinson. a stan-
dout before missing last year withan
injury, also is back for Jerry Welsh.

Women Cagers Begin Season Tonight

by Debi Schwartz

the women‘s basketball team
opens its l4-gamc schedule tonight
against Oswcgo at University Gym-
nasium.

A quick glance at the Danettes
shows a very short team—70 per cent
at the players are under the 5‘7 mark
and 40 per cent below 5'4. To
counteract this height disadvantage.
they will have to rely mainly on their
speed in addition to utilizing a zone
defense and fastbreakiiig techniques.

The rebounding chores will fall
mainly on Iillcn Daily. n 5‘I I junior.

who is a newcomer to the squad.
Helping her out in the forward spots
will be Mary Ann Crotty (5‘7'/z
sophomore). Mary Ellen Foley (5‘7
senior). and Kathy Harig (5‘7

sophmore)—al| returnees. Junior‘

Paula Canasick (5‘8). a first season
player. rounds out the forecourt.
Playmaker Sugihara

In the backcourt. the Danettes will
rely on 'I‘racy Sugihiira (sophomore.
5‘0) I'or ball-handling and playmak—
ing. Assisting her will be Marilyn
Hinden (junior; 4‘l0). and Nancy
liartlc (senior; 5‘4). 'l‘wo freshmen.

Ann Price. at 5'5 and Elizabeth
Prosalik at 5‘4 should add speed and
depth to the Albany backcourt.

Coach Karen Cunningham feels
that with a bit more conditioning
and endurance work. the team will
be in good shape to start off the
season. Co-captains Foley and Bar-
tle will have the experience of last
year to aid them through what looks
to be a rough schedule.

The Dancttes have potential, but
they will have to quicken their price.
Because of ii lack of depth on their
bench.thcy willalso haveto keep out
of foul trouble. One of the problems
they must overcome is their late start
due to the length of the women‘s
volleyball season.

'l'onight's game begins at 7:30 p.m.
