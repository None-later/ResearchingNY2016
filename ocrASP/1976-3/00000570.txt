Albany's Vle Cesare (44) straining for rebound. Cesare scored 11
points as the Danes beat Marist 103-85 Int night In opener.

Injuries to two key players
hobbled the Albany Great Dane
basketball team last night as it open-
ed its 1976-77 season agath Marist
at the University Gym.

Senior guard Gary Trevett. who
missed the ﬁnal ten games last year
with a broken wrist. has been
bedridden for morethan a week with
a severe charley horse in his thigh.
“I‘ll be surprised if he's able to play
before the Capital District Tourna-
ment (Dec. 28-29)." said Coach Dick
Sauers. who added that ‘I‘revctt "was
playing the best of our guards“
before getting hurt. The 6‘2
playmaker is Albany‘s all-time assist
leader.

Bad Back

Captain Bob Audi. a senior
forward. injured his back in a scrim-
mage and is unlikely to see any ac-
tion until next week. “There is
nothing structurally wrong.“ Sauers
reported, “but he's having muscle
spasms and stiffness that may take
time to heal." Audi averaged “.0
points a game last year.

Sauers was “more concerned
about having to go tothe bench than
about who starts." last night.
Without Trevett and Audi. the
Danes are down to nine varsity
players.

Grapplers Se t; Open Tomorrow

State University of Albany's
wrestling team will open its 76-77

quadrangular meet against Oneonta.
R.P.I.. and Union College at I p.m.

With a year's experience underthe
belts of the returning squad and a
host of freshmen with outstanding
high school wrestling credentials,
coach Joe Garcia is looking for a
dramatic rebound from last year's
calamitous 0-l7 season.

Of the IS freshmen wrestlers,
seven of them Were award-winning
grapplcrs in high school. and all were
team captains during their career.

School, won four varsity letters and
was named Most Valuable Player
every year. Gemmiti will compete in
the till pound class.

mark. and Daiiey is expected to do
well.

At 134 pounds. are freshmen
Howie Berger (Schenectady, NY).
senior Joe Keefer (Lindenhurlt.
NY), and Ed Hemmer (Brockport.

NY). a sophomore. Berger was Sec-
tion llchampion last year and finish-

pounds are freshmen Dave
Rosenberg (Mamaroneck. NY) and
Mike Oster (Carmel. NY).

Joining Zubulake in the I50

possess exceptional high school
wrestling‘backgrounds.

The l67 pound class is according
to Garcia "spread pretty thin" with
only one wrestler making the weight

Steve Lawrence (Brooklyn. NY).
Davis was runner-up in the sec-
tionals in his senior year in high

school. Lawrence will be coming off

his starting defensive tackle position
on the football team. He was injured
early last year, and is considered an
outstanding wrestler.

Starting against Marist were
senio'r Mike Suprunowicz and
sophomore Winston Royal in the
baekcourt. 6’7 sophomore center
Barry Cavanaugh. and 6‘3 senior Vic
Cesare and 6'2 sophomore Staton
Winston at the forwards. First off
the bench were junior Kevin Keane.
a three-year veteran who can play all
three positions. and sophomore
guard Buddy Wleklinski. Behind
them were sophomore frontcourters
Carmelo Verdejo and Dave Landry.

Suprunowicz and Royal were
starters last year. with the former
averaging |2.2 points a game as the
team‘s second leading scorer and the
latter coming on strong after being
summoned from the JV when
'l‘revett was hurt. Cavanaugh led the
team with a l3.5 scoring average and
should be the dominant Albany
player again this winter. Cesare led
the team in rebounds. while scoring
at an “.0 ppg pace. Winston 23.7
ppg with the JV and has great poten-
tial.

Marist opened with a [06-78 loss
at Division I Iona last week. Coach

bothup from the JV. Lack of size at
guard hurt Marist against Iona. The
center. 6'6 Neil Lajeunesse, who was
averaging seven ppg last year before
leaving the team in January. scored
l5 at lona. Albany had won six of
eight games with Marist before last
night's game.
,SUNYAC Hopes

Tomorrow's game against Cor-
tland will be Albany's first hurdle in
the Dane‘s attempt to win the State
University of New York Athletic
Conference title for tile first time.
Coach Al Stockholm is pinning his
hopes on transfers. three of whom
will be in starting line-up; 6'5 Gerald
Greiner. 6‘4 Jim Stank. and 6‘7 Tom
Howitt. Stockholm looks to them to
provide the strong inside game that
was lacking in last winter‘s 4-I8
team. The guards are returnees Ed
Leone and Terry Murphy, with
Mike Valenti. former Albany J‘.’
player, as a backcourt sub.

Albany. which won at Cortland
last year. 7545. leads the series
between the two teams. I4-7. Game

Swimmers Inaugurate Season Tomorrow;
White Unveils ‘Best Crop Of Freshmen’

With nine lettermen returning
from last year's 5-5 squad. and what
head coach Ron White calls. “the
best crop of freshmen we‘ve ever
had." the Great Danes swimming
team will open their regular season
tomorrow against host New I‘altz.

“We're lookingto Dave and Mitch
Rubin to be exceptionally strong in
their events." White said. Senior co-
captnin Mitch swims the butterfly
and distance freestyle. Junior Dave
is a distance freestyle and individual
medley swimmer. “Last year Dave
moved around outside his events."
White noted. “and did an excep-
tional job."

Freshmen Backstrokers

White is looking at two freshmen
and a transfer student to carry the
load in the backstroke event. Mike
McCann and John Loonam are the
freshmen and junior Tim McCarthy
will provide depth to the event.

In the freestyle competition. co-
cuptain I’aul Marshman a senior.
and sophomore Fred Zimmerman
will be backing Mitch Rubin.

In the butterﬂy. White is counting
on junior Steve Bookbinder and
junior Jeff Cohen in the
breaststroke.

The diving chores will be handled
by junior Art Rosenberg who is
current university record holder for
the one and three meter diving
events.

Other returning veterans expected
to lend strength to the team are
senior Vic Bordowski and junior
Mark Jal'fc. In addition to McCann
and Loonam. White is very high on
freshmen Ed Watkins and Bill
Stockwell. Watkins swims the
butterfly and individual medley
events and according to White “has
looked fabulous in the early season
training program.“ Stockwell. who
played junior varsity football. will
join the team in December. White
wants to give Stockweli. the team-
mate of swimmer Tim Shaw of
Wilson High School in Long Beach,
Calif. it good rest from his football
chores. “He's a good second
semester swimmer." says White.

“"l‘he biggest early meet we have."
White says. “is l’lattsburgh. That
meet really haunts me." In the past
two meetings the Cardinals have

' won both by scores of 63-50 and 58-

55.
Looking at other State University
of New York Athletic Conference

(SU N YAC) teams. White sees
l’otsdam as the team to defeat for the
conference championships.
"Gcncseo. the surprise winner of last
year's conference meet." he says.
“will also be tough. We'll be meeting
Oneontn for the first time this year.
If we defeat Oswcgo. that should br-
ing us over the .500 mark and be the
turning point in the season. We've
beaten them the past two years with
what I think was generally a weaker
team. but the kids always managed
to put it together against them.“
Illness Hurt

“I think our 8th place finish last
year at the SUNYAC was not in-
dicative of our strength. Dave Rubin
could not compete because of a
severe bout with the flu. If he had
been healthy l'm sure we would have
had a better showing."

"We'll be facing the toughest non-
conference teams we've ever faced."
says White. They'll meet Kings
College. St. Michael's. Bridgewmer.
and R.P.I.I “which has come a long
way in the last year and a half."

The Danes open the home season
against Piattsburgh on Saturday.
December ii. at 2 pm. at University
Pool.

by Jonathan Hodges

The question ofwhether to allow a
recreational fieldhouse financing
referendum to come before student
voters will be decided by Central
Council tomorrow night.

The fieldhouse. which would be
used to ease overcrowding in the
gym,is expected to cost ap-
proximately 52 million. The propos-
ed referendum calls for a mandatory
student fee of $|3.50 a semester for a
period of twenty years.

The referendum is the result of a
study conducted during the last nine
months by the Student Recreational
Center Committee. The final dollar
figure was arrived at by the com-
mittee‘s decision that a structure
similar to Boston College's
recreational complex would be most
suitable for the SUNYA campus.

Included in the referendum is a
stipulation that requires a voter tur-
nout of 40 per cent. Of this 40 per
cent. a minimun of 60 per cent must
be in favor of the referendum. “The
committee felt that we could not go
forward [on the fieldhouse] with
anything less than a mandate." ex-
plained committee chairman Robert
Squatriglia of the Office of Student
Life.

In an effort to increase voter tur-
nout. the proposal to Council con-
tains plans for a new voting
procedure. said Squatriglia. Com-
puter cards will be distributed to
students over a number of days.
Students will then fill in their social
security number,and vote.

The cards will be processed twice.
The first computer run will record

social security numberljto ascertain
whether the student is presently
enrolled and whether he has already
voted. When this is completed. the
social security numbers will be torn
off the ballots to insure secrecy.

The votes will then be tabulated.
The referendum will fail if less than
4,000 students vote or if, given at
least a 4.000 student turnout. less
than 2.400 students vote “yes” for the
fieldhouse.

The design for the fieldhouse was
chosen after examining various
alternatives presently being used on
other campuses. The Boston College
design was selected after the com-
mittee rejected a ‘bubble‘ concept
used at SUNY Buffalo as not being
permanent enough.

Architectural Estimates

The architect~ of the Boston
College structur. Dan Tuiiey. visited
SUNYA last semester. 'l‘ulley said
his buildings can be constructed in
about nine months. He estimates
that his buildings presently cost
between SIB-SM a square foot. Bas-
ed on a committee's decision that a
fieldhouse of about 50.000 square
feet is needed, the target figure of $2
million was reached.

The fieldhouse. if built. would
contain four indoor tennis courts
with the ability to expand to six.
Handball, paddlebsil and racquet-
ball courts would be built as well as
a onecighth of a mile track. Locker
rooms and saunas would be provid~
ed in addition to a number ofsmaller
area activities such as billiards. gym-
nastics and weight room.

In addition to its athletic func-

T039 Decided ~

Council. to Rule on Referendum Wednesday

tions. the fieldhouse would provide -

seating for concerts. It is estimated
that the fieldhouse would be able to
seat between4.500and 5.500 people.

A referendum is required due to a
current SUNY freeze on the con-
struction of capital projects. In
I97 i , SU N Y A was three weeks away
from the approval of a $3 million
recreational center bond when the
freeze was imposed. said Squatriglia.
The center would have been similar
to a structure at SUNY College at
Potsdam.

“During the summer we met with
two vice-Chancellors," Squatriglia.
“When we told them about the plan
for students financing the fieldhouse
they said we were on the right track."

If the referendum passes the man-
datory tax would be imposed on all
undergraduates with nine credits or
more. According to SA President

Gun Hearings To Begin Today

by Thomas Martelio

The question of whether security
officers should be allowed to carry
firearms will be discussed today at
the lirst of three University Com-
munity Council open hearings.

The discussion will focus on a
proposal by security officers to

    

Security Director James Williams supports increased arming ol

modify SUNYA's Firearms Policy.
The modification would permit of-
ficers assigned to motorized patrol
and the evening desk to carry
firearms. according to Director of
the Department of Public Safety
James Williams. Currently, IZofthe
force's 48 officers are authorized to

krouts

officers on campus. A dozen university policemen now carry guns.

carry firearms.

This proposal has met with stu-
dent opposition. according to a
number of Central Council
members.

The proposed modification stems
from a letter two officers wrote to
President Emmett B. Fields re-
questing that he allow patrol officers
to carry firearms on duty and on
patrol. The letter. which was sent to
Fields Oct. l5. was in reaction to two
incidents with which the olf‘icers felt
ill-equipped to deal unarmed.

One incident involved the
shooting out of headlights with a
handgun.

“The officers could have been shot
for their efforts," said Williams.
“They were unarmed officers."

The other incident was the arrest
of a non-student who had in his
possession a shotgun and a loaded
pistol.

“That was a real gun with real
bullets and they were two unarmed
officers. We've had other things. . .
these two incidents were the sums
that broke the camel's back." said
Williams.

in a letter to Acting Vice President
for Finance and Business John Hur-
tigan. Williams supported the of-
flcers' request. Williams outlined a
nuthber of serious crimes that have
occurred on campus in the past five
years and termed that request “not
unreasonable." He also modified the

not printed to his satisfaction.

This new policy is the result of a
resolution. passed by a vote of 23-0-
2, in the Nov. I9 session ofthe stu-
dent senate. Penned by Senator'Ai
Sacks and seconded by David
Higgins. the resolution is policy fora
year :

“Whereas the students of this
college uphold the idea of freedom of
the press

Therefore we do hereby
resolve: that any student of this
college submitting any article or
letter to be printed in the Racquette.
and meeting the legal deadline for
entry. shall not be denied the right to
have his article printed. Material
deemed necessary to censor or alter
in any way which changes the
general intent or purpose ofthat arti-
cle may be done for the purpose of
avoiding possible legal repercussions
which may subsequently. as a result
of its printing. be directed toward the
Kacquette staff or the SGA.

Should the author of the article or
letter disagree as to the necessity of
the proposed changes. the author
may challenge the decision of the
Racquette through the court. The
decison ol the court shall be final.
Any reason for non-publication of
an article or letter other than that of
foreseeable legal action taken
against the Racquette or SUA shall
cortstttue an unreasonable breach of
freedom of access to the press as a
medium for student expression.

Freezing Funds

Such a breach shall result infrcez-
ing of funds to the Racquette
newspaper by the student senate.

In case more material is submitted
than could be printed. because of
splice limitations. the Racquette. in
order to meet advertising
obligations. has the right to limit the
number of letters submitted. They
then may print those letters the
followtng week if the author of the
letter wishes."

According to Senator Sacks.
"Right now the SGA could freeze
anyone‘s budget. If anything. this
resolution limits the SGA‘s power to
f'reere the Rncquctte's budget by set-
ting guidelines for such action."

Sacks believes that a change in
policy is needed. “A number of
students mentioned to me that they
had submitted articles that were not
printed. I am their'senator‘. andthey
asked if there was anything I COUlt
do."

Critics of the resolution have
stated that the new policy willenable
anyone to publish anything or to
freeze the budget. Sacks responded
by saying. "The resolution said ar-
ticles and letters. l‘m sure the senate
would not do anything so absurd as
to to freeze funds. if someone sub-
mitted something like a phone
book."

Directly opposing this point of
view, Editor-in-Chief of the Rac-
quette, Bill LaRue had this to say. “I
feel the resolution has violated sec-
tion 17 of the student code.
Therefore I will be protesting the
resolution in next week‘s senate ses-
sion by submitting a new resolution
which will nulil'y the other."

Degradlng Quality

He believes. “The resolution. ifen-
forced. will cause a vast degradation
of the quality ofthe Racquette. Pre-
sent editorial policies sufficiently
perfect the student‘s access to the
Racquette."

LaRue also cited new editorial
policies voted in at a meeting of the
editorial board on October 3 of this
year.

The new rules state:

I) Anyone submitting a story has
the right to confer with the editor
about changes in content.

2) Changes in stories must be
justified in the margins of the
