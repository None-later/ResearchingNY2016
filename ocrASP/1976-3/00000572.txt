ALBANY. NY. (AP) Governor
Hugh Carey says he views the
proposed settlement with Indians
occupying state land in the Adiron-
dacks as a “very positive plan" but
Will not give his final endorsement
yet.

Secretary of State Mario Cuomo.
the state‘s negotiator with the In-
dians living at Moss Lake for the
past two and a half years, has
proposed that they be allowed to

lease another piece of'statc land. The
new land‘s location has not been dis-
closed.

Cuomo said it would be less that
[.000 acres and not within the state
forest preserve.

Carey noted that the Indian
leaders are still discussing the
proposal. “I cannot pass upon it
because if [the proposal] is still in
negotiation.“ he said at a news cott-
ference yesterday.

Swine .- Flu   ‘

by Florle Shertur
' The American Public Health Ser-
vice has determined that all those in-
dividuals t’rom Its-24 years of age
who received a swine flu shot, must
receive a second shot. This
recommendation was made on the
basis of studies that discovered that
unless a second shot was tid-
ministcrcd. sufficient immunizution
would not develop due to the failure
of people in this age group to build
tip antibodies as well as those 25 or
older.

booster shot must be administered
no earlier than one month after the
first shot. The second monovalent
swine flu shots, for inididuals 18-24
who received the first Swine flu shot,
will be available Wednesday
January I9, I977 and Thursday
January 20. I977, from 9 am. to 4

The second bivalent swine flu shot
for individuals Iii-24 with basic
health problems will be available in
the Health Service at the lndividual's
convicnence, four weeks after their
first shot.

The second shot should be taken
by anyone who took the first shot.
"Otherwise." stated Hood, “the first
shot would be a waste.“

According tothe American Public
