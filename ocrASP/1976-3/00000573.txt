ottecx an , ndocuinented.
according to "Dr.  Edward It.
Chiburis ofthe Weston Observatory
of Boston College.

'between April i arid .Iune30 of.

this " year. 35 earthquakes were
detected in the northeastern United
States. Chiburiii said. Of that total.

'2I earthquakes registering less that I

l.0 on the Richter scale were record-
ed in the Blue Mountain Lake region
of New York. V 1

Such activity is usually detected
only by instruments. and the tremors
are rarely felt.

But Chiburis said in a recent inter-
view that he believes that an expan-
sion of earthquake detection efforts
will show Maine to be a more active
state.

Chiburis said that Northeastern
U.S. Seismic thWork provides in-
formation to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for setting standards
for construction of atomic power
plants. His reports include informa-
tion supplied by a seismic network
operated by the Con Ed Co. of New
York. which produced electricity
wrth nuclear power.

Cniburis said an analysis of the
seismic waves can help determine the
direction ofstress underground and
help predict earth features in the

future. Walter Anderson, assistant .

state geologist in Maine. said such
studies will help investigations of a!
submerging coast line. He said that
in the past l00 years. the coast in
Maine has sunk about afoot. with a
more pronounced drop in Canada‘s
maritime provinces.

“We want to know what the hell is
causing it.“ Anderson said.

Chiburis also said baSe stations
are being established in the Allagash

Wilderness Waterway of Northern 1

Maine to determine what normal
seismic activity is for the area. The
massive Dickey-Lincoln hydroelec-
tric project. which would flood
almost 90,000 acres of the area. is
currently being studied by the Army
Corps of Engineers.

lithe dam is built as planned in the
next decade. seismologists would be
able to compare earthquake activity
following construction to determine
what change it any took place.

'I he open~cnded Richter scale
measures ground movement. with
six on the scale signifying a severe
earthquake. Chihuris said that each
whole number increase in the
magnitude of a Richter scale reading
represents about 30 times the energy
of the tremor represented by the
preceding number. San h'ranctsco's
disastrous i906 earthquake
registered 8.3 on the scale.

'1 his year. l7 monitoring stations
are being operated by the network in
Connecticut. Rhode Island,
Massachusetts. New Hampshire and
Maine. Next year. the number at
stations will increase to 40. he said.

in addition. other cooperating
observatories are providing infor-
mation on tremors in New York.
Vermont. New Jersey. Penn-
sylvania. Canada and Delaware.

request byproposing that those of-
ficers assigned to motorized patrol
and manning the evening desk be
issued guns.

“i think‘ it will worsen the
relationship between students and
security officers," said Central
Council member Jean Stabinslty. “I
don't think that I would feel safer
'with them carrying guns. I would
probably feel less safe."

Stabinsky has been organizing
students in an attempt to convince
the UCC to discard the proposed
modification.

“I realize that Kent State wasn‘t
exactly parallel situation. but it was
a case where people in authority had
guns and misused them and there‘s
always the danger of that happening
on this campus. It‘s a tremendous
power to be giving them guns . . .
already a number have them.“

According to Williams. there
sometimes are no officers on duty
authorized to use firearms.

“Twelve officers may sound like a.
lot. but effective numbers is what
we‘re concerned about. The l2 peo-
ple that l named are not here all
together at a given time. We operate
seven days a week. 24 hours a day. all
year long.“ he said.

lhosc officers who are presently
authorized to carry firearms include
four investigators. live supervisors.

what would happen would be that
this college could be turned into an

According to :Williams. the rising

crime rate hasécontributed to the.

reasons for the request.
Offenses Up
"'l'otal reported offenses are up
about is percent this year as op-

.posed to last year." he said. “The

crimes against persons — the
assaults. attempted rapes. armed
robberies. etc. — are three times as
prevalent this year as compared to
last year. There have‘beeri a total of
about l,l00crimes reported on cam-
pus this year."

While the majority of these crimes
have been of a minor nature.
Williams is distressed at the rise in
violent crimes and those against per-
sons.

“I think the officers have been
lucky in not being injured." said
Williams. “I think that this is one of
the highest. if not the highest per
capita crime incidence areas in the
capital district.“

Dressler said. “I‘m concerned with

“we‘repsying to live here on corn;

pus." said Stabinsky. “The danger“ 'of r
them having guns outweighs their.

need for it." She question whether
the campus officers were qualified
for firearms authorization.

"l‘lie persons who are presently
authorized to carry firearms receive
more firearms training than
probably any other police force in
the area.“ said Williams. “Naturally.
those who are not authorized to
carry firearms aren‘t trained as of
yet. 'l'heygwill be before they/are
issued firearms. First. we want to do
it [train them 1. and secondly. it‘s re-
quired by the SUNY board of
'l'rustees."

.the campus security force has had
selective use of firearms for the past

three and a half years. according to '

Williams. He added that in that time
period. no incidents regarding the
misuse of iirearms by campus of-
ficers occurred.

Can’t Find Reasons

"We tried extremely hard to find
reasons why they shouldn‘t be allow-
ed to Carry guns." said SA President
Steve DiMeo. "I can't find one
reason why we shouldn‘t have added
personnel who are allowed to carry
firearms. What we have to look at js
that arming security officers is not to
arrest students. that isn't the
problem. but to adequately
safeguard the rights. safety and
welfare of the student body.“

According to Williams. most of
Security's troubles on campus do not
involve students.

“Virtually all of the serious
offenses we‘ve made arrests for are
non—students. people attracted to the
campus because it‘s an attractive
place to come."

SUNYA is the only university
center in the SUNY system that
allow any of its officers to be armed.

' an emergency arises where guni are

said.

'I'he'sittiation is similar at SUNY
at binghamton.

“We carry no firearms. nor night

At'SUNY at Buffalo. the campus
police remain unarmed despite it
recommendation that they be
authorized for firearms by a univer-
sity president's committee.

“It was in 1972.“ said Assistant
Director of Security at SUNY at
buffalo Lee Uriii‘in. "the committee
had about 25 people on it'. students.
faculty. staff. outside community.
The decision made was for the presi-
dent ot the university to seriously
consider selectively arming officers.
After that. a second committee
recommended the same thing. I‘he
president. however. never acted on
it."

“He gave no reasons. he was just
opposed to arms." said (.iriffin. Urif—
tin added that. like SUNYA. SUNY
at Buffalo‘s major crimes are com-
mitted by people from outside the
university.

Williams stated that SUNYA is
unique in the sense that less outside
police assistance is available.

“At other campuses. when they
have a felony in progress. or a com-
plaint that involves it use of
weapons. they summon an outside
police department. We‘re the only
one. i believe, as far as SUNY‘s are
concerned. that outside departments
do not respond to on a routine basis.

Steve DiMeo, only those students

be excluded.

Committee members said that
they feel in the long run the

all students would be allowed in for
