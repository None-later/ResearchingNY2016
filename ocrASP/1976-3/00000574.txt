Duhnie, ‘6l, said she imagined 'a
trapdy. ‘ -
“My darling sister. I thought she
had been run over—l‘d rather my
two arms had been cut off," she
recalled she imagined at the time.
Elizabeth said she was driving the
family to their Putnam Valley coun-
try home to deliver Christmas

packages and believed Margaret was '

still quietly reading the newspaper as
they approached their destination.
Their father. Henning. who is hard
of hearing, was sitting quietly
alongside Elizabeth.

Yorktown police had alerted all
other police agencies along the route
which included the Shore Parkway
in Brooklyn and Queens. the
Whitestone Bridge leading to the
Bronx, the Cross-Bronx Ex-
pressway. the Bronx River Parkway
and the ’l'aconic Parkway.

Hours later. the mystery was
cleared up—after Putnam Valley
friends of the Duhmes received a
telephone call from Margaret saying
she was alright.

Yorktown police said when
Elizabeth threw the required number
of coins into a collector alter cross-
ing the Whitestonc Bridge. one coin
failed to go into the basket and
Margaret alighted to correct the
problem. Meanwhile. the toll booth
barrier ascended properly without
the exact coinage and Elizabeth
drove off never noticing her sister
had gotten out. police said.

“It wasn't funny at the time.“ said
Elizabeth later.

“Maybe alter I relax a little, l'll get
it out of my system."

'She said a motorist behind her
gave her stranded sister a dollar to
make telephone calls until police
arrived because her purse was still in
the back seat of the car.

In the wake of the increasing
numbers of kidnappings and
murders of corporate executives
around the world, the private securi-
ty industry is doing a booming
business.

The Lox Angeli-s Times reports
that lirms ollcring the latest in “unti-

it nearly impossible to keep up with

According the the Times. other

The Phillip Morris Company is
threatening ‘to take legal action
against a British film" production
firm that has featured the famous
"Marlboro Man” in an anti-smoking
documentary.

The documentary in question con-
tains short segments ol'the Marlboro
cowboy interspersed with filmed in-

cowboy being interviewed on

boy reportcdpy developed terminal
emphysema as a direct result of
smoking.

A Phillip Morris executive says
that advertising footage of the
Marlboro man in Marlboro Country
were provided to the British com-
pany “in good faith.“ Says the ex-
ecutivc. Frank Saunders: “We were
bad. sandbagged and doublecross-
ed."

It Phillip Morris is unable to stop
the film‘s release. CBS‘s “60

Minutes“ has indicated it may
televise portions ol'the film in the US

SEEDOMETER
A 'I'ulanc University biologist
reports she has discovered that seeds
have a mysterious way of “knowing”
when the moon is full. and even at
“knowing” weeks in advance that a

hurricane is approaching.

Doctor Jane Panzer says a three-
year research project has found that
‘seedsplaced in a liquid solution'ab-
sorb certain amounts of water.
depending on the cycle of the moon.
When the moon is full. she says. the
water intake doubles.

Panzer states the lunar pull is not
the only force apparently affecting
seeds. She says that three weeks
before hurricane Carmen struck the
New Orleans area. all the seeds in her
laboratory begun “actingstrangely.”

'I'he biologist told Organic Gar-
dening and Farming magazine that
most of the seeds quit absorbing
water two weeks prior to the
hurricane and then resumed normal
activity several weeks after the storm
had passed.

FAREWELL TO ARMS

A sign of the times we live in is a
recent invention out dl Chicago
which designers are suggesting may
be the latest fad in wearingapparei.

The invention is a hand grenade.
which can easily be stashed in a
pocket or purse. When its wearer
pulls the pin on this hand grenade.
however. the Weapon doesn't ex-
plode. Instead. it cmitsa shrill. pier-
cing wail that is impossible to shut
off.

The inventors. Bo Jaremus and
Manuel Goodman. think that
women and men around the country
will want to carry the urban hand
grenade as a defense against possible
muggch and other like-minded at-
tackers. The idea is that the Would-
bc assailants Would flee quickly
when the weapon begins shrieking.
