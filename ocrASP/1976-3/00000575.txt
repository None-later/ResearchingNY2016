Now that the woman‘s place no longer need
» be the‘home. but cannot yet beast‘reely chosen

as one might wish. the changes in societal
patterns and sex roles has left women with
special and unique needs in their/our efforts
to understand and cope with these changes.
University women. for example—and the
term now includes mothers. daughters. wives.
even grandmothers—need a focal point on the
college campus: one which would respond to
women’s needs and concerns. which would
offer activities. programs. and services of vital
relevcnce to women. and which would be
geared to all University women.

Unlike other universities. the ratio of
females to males at SUNYA is approximately
l:l. Yet. all other SUNY centers. and many
other SUNY campusesv—Buffitlo. Oswego.
Binghamton. Stonybrook. et al—can boast
the existence of women's centers. Has
SUNYA. supposedly an aware and educated
campus community in the capital of New York
State. somehow decided that a comparable
resource for our own women is unnecessary——
deemed it unworth fighting for?

In past years. many programs aimed
primarily at women have been attempted-
informal programs such as the establishment
of consciousness raising groups. reading
groitps. mini—courses in areas of special in-
terest to women (attto mechanics. self-defense.
crafts). and coft'echotises. These have not been
its successful as they ntight have been had there
existed a single. centraIi/cd and easily accessi-
ble site for wottiens‘ gatherings. Other services
such as women's self-help clinics. communal

dinners. personal counseling and special
library resources have existed is scattered and
sporadic events; given an established location
in a permanently staffed women's center. such
programs could be successfully implemented
on a continuing and professional basis.

Speakers-and groups which might have at-
tracted large numbers of women and men have
often not done so. for the same reason that
student-initiated gatherings have often
struggled and were ultimately forced to dis-
hand: lack ofa place to meet. The amount of
available university space—lecture centers.
lounges. assembly halls —-is the object of fierce
contention as these areas are booked months
in advance and often reserved on a standing
basis. Potentially well-attended functions are
never held or forced out of existence because
the crucial reservation could not be made. _
Many university women have children. The
faculty and stiidcntsthcrefor have need of a
diiy care center so that no one will be forced to
bring children to classes and/or missclasses.
Women ttt SUNY Albany need it Resource
Center in which the objectives of equality can
he furthered through coordinated woman-
orientcd activities. services and programming
with ongoing staff. While all activities need
not occtir within the facility. its establishment
is crucial to the attainment ofa successful and
responsive women's program. The develop-
iitctit of ati identifiable facility provides the
basis for the development of an identiﬁable
program. What is called for is the establish-
ntetil of not otily a facility. btit a concept:
women's place at SUNYA.

' energetle efforts

To the Editor:

You may have noticed that there is an
energy conservation movement on campus. In
conjunction with our Environment class. we
have decided to take action against a serious
problem which needed attention. Our project
started with a student survey that included
questions concerning possible energy cuts and
redistribution. Our results showed that 92% of
the students were concerned about energy use
and willing to make a sacrifice. Other results
were: the majority of the students use their
lights and other electrical appliances un-
necessarily and that high percentages of the
students agreed with the energy cuts already
made on campus (including cold water
washing machines. dimmed lights andlowered
temperatures). Students also suggested the
transfer of energy use from places such as the
fountains. dorm hallway and lounge lights.
and empty classrooms to certain places where
they feel more lights are needed for their safe-
ty. Students wanted more lights at the
SUNYA bus stops and paths leading to them.

  

itself and the parking lots. Students also
suggested separate utility bills to make people
aware of how much energy they use.

Aside from the student survey we put up a
series of posters reminding students that titey
could help by shutting off their lights. we also
met with Utility Chief Wayne Allen of the
SUN YA Power Plant to discuss energy use on
Campus. We were very well received and he
supplied us with an overwhelming amount or
useful information. We were surprised to find
out that over the past three years, energy use
on campus has decreased by 20%. This is due
to more efﬁcient planning within the Power
Plant. Allen stated that the main reason for
the energy cuts was monetary. but that he did
care personally about energy conservation as
an environmental issue. He hoped that our
campaign would lead to community and stu-
dent involvement in this area. Allen admitted
that a major problem with continuing energy
conservation measures on campus was the
shortage of staff and funds in his department.
The amount of paperwmk that is required
(including monthly reports about how much
energy has been saved) takes time away irotn
many other projects.

Many of Allen‘s suggestions for continued
energy cuts and redistribution were similar to
the responses of the students we surveyed. At
our second meeting with Wayne Allen \lt.‘

And Now For Nothing
Completely Different

by Willlam Heller

Nothing . . . that's a lot to think about.
Think about it for a few seconds or a few
minutes or a few days. weeks. months. years.
eternity. What comes to mind. . .anything'.’

Nothing. . . may be more complexthan it
seems at first glanc‘e. it is possible that
everything started from ncthiiig. Countless
cons ago there was no universe as we know it
today. There was no mass.just nothing. Today
we can readily see evidence of something. The
newspaper in your hands was nothing last
week. Some may argue that it is still nothing.
but kidding aside. to ay it is a concrete and
tangible thing. Apparently something comes
from nothing.

Much of today's society is based on nothing.
Some sociologists believe that this is a major
reason for the much heralded breakdown of
societal norms and morality in the modern
era. I do not subscribe tothis beliel‘since value
judgements cannot be attached to nothing.
Nothing can be good or nothing can be bad.
As with most things. nothing is situationaily
bound. Again. think about it. There must have
been times when you felt that nothing was bad.

Life is an interesting thing to look at in
terms of nothing. When babies are born they
are completely dependent on others. An infant
can do nothing by itself. based on this. it
would seem that nothing its inate.

As the child grows older it becomes bored
With nothing and learns to do some things.
Havmg been “nothinged out" at a young age. a
child will do less and less nothing. and what
the child doesn‘t do will be carefully disguised
as something.

This dynamic process continues unabated
until a certain point. At some age. usually
when the offspring becomes financially in-
dependent from the parents. the process is
reversed. The person continues to do
something. i.e. work. in the hope that he or she
will be able to do nothing at frequent intervals
(vacations) or after it certain age (retirement).
So, the life cycle seems to be nothing followed
by something and concluded by nothing.
Overall. it seems that nothing is the dominant
force in life.

Getting back to the notion that today's
society is based on nothing. let's look at a few
examples. Well. there aren't any. Now I have
nothing to write. There's one right here.
Writers often have nothing to write. but they

are forced to write something so they can get
vacations—and write nothing-~tind CVL'nllliliv
ly retire—and write nothing. In short. Wl'tlcrs
have nothing to write so they write so the)
don't have to write. Am I right'.’

it is a fact that the government Silhsltil/L‘s
big iarnts to grow nothing. the wealth)
farmer gets wealthier by doing nothing. \ou
in this situation it looks like nothing is an itti'
vantage for the rich. Don‘t let this tool )till.
however. While the wealthy farmer gets Pillti
something to grow nothing. the hungry pout
persoti gets paid nothing to eat nothing. iilll\.
the poor person has twice as much per capita
nothing as the wealthy person. Now you tell
me: which one is better off!

Remember Richard Nixon? You might
wonder what he‘s up to these days. Yes. you
probably guessed it—«nothing. And he WIN a
handsome salary for it. Nixon gets nearly
Si00.000 a year plus benefits not to he Presi-
dent. Some claim that it is also a great respon~
sibility not being President and iii Nixon‘s case
this is probably true. In the near future we
might look forward to dozens of persons an-
nouncing their candidacy to not be president.
It'sa very prestigiousjobforthosc who Wish to
do nothing.

Nothing htis great potential to be in vogue iii
the Ii'cld of higher education. I would like to
call for a new discipline in our nation's
universities—~the study of nothing. Of Course
there will be those traditionalists who Wlii
scoff at this suggestion. but they decry any
change. The study of nothing is really quite
practical. With thejob market the way it is to-
day. niany college graduates finish school and
do nothing. 0n the surface this could be nice.
btit students today just aren't prepared lot
nothing. They don't know how to handle it
properly. In studying nothing the college stu-
dent would gain not only a keen insight. hut
valuable experience in nothing.

if we accept my premise that today‘s society
is based on nothing. and that nothing can he a
good thing. then we can safely assume that ii is
not nothing whiclt hits been eroding societal
norms and morality. Conversely. it is
something that is causing this brettkdowa.
Further elevating the status of nothing we can

effect. Through our surveys. posters, and this
letter. we hope that we have increased student
awareness of the energy problem and offered
ways they can help. Wayne Allen agreed with
us that personal energy sacrifice does make it
difference. Conserve Energy! We can do it if
we all help.

apartheld axed

To the Editor:

We wish to inform the student community
that the Pan-Caribbean Association is in no
way involved with the Y.S.A. We did not agree
to sponsor the talk by Mr. Tony Thomas deal-
ing with Apartheid in South Africa.

The Pan-Caribbean Association takes a
very strong position against the practice of"
Apartheid in South Africa and racial oppres-
sion of any people. We have long been in-
volved in educating and informing the univer-
sity community of the struggles against racial
oppression around the world, through our
own program of speakers and workshops. We
condemn the unprincipled behavior of the
Y.S.A. in this matter.

help wanted

To the Editor:

Last Wednesday night. while a friend and I
were playing racquetball in the gym, I was ac-
cidently hit in the head with a racquet. I
started bleeding profuser and my friend im-
mediately ran for help.

l was lying on the ground for ten minutes
until Sue Miller who was working at the desk
in the main office. came by. The job did not
require that she know first aid. but luckily. Sue
had had training. Treatment fora wound such
as mine cannot be vcrycilcctive when there are
no first aid kits available. however she did all
that she could. in the whole gym.especially on
a weekday night. l can‘t believe there was no
first aid equipment handy. to say nothing of
the fact that there was no individual assigned
to administer first aid techniques.

informed that aid was on its way. I remain-
ed bleeding on the gym floor for another twen-
ty minutes until it was finally decided that I
should be driven to the hospital in a friend‘s
car. i was helped to the car and left for the
hospital one half hour after the accident oc-
cured. l was later informed that a student
driver. not even an ambulance. had arrived ten
minutes after we left.

I received emergency treatment at St.
Peter's Hospital an hour after the injury oc-
cured. Treatment could have been facilitated
had someone been on the scene. or had
emergency transportation arriVed.

There was one tragic death earlier this year;
it is the responsibility of us all to see that
medical aid can be quickly obtained in the

gym. V

artist’s dilemma

To the Editor:

SUNYA has among other colleges. a
College of Arts and Sciences. In an era when
most of the tribe's creative energies and sup-
port are being given to the scientific and
technological disciplines. the elimination ofan
area ofhumnnities such as Art History. should

  

university center that acknowledpa its
traditional obligation for teaching, research.
and service to the community must be
question in the light of‘such an act. Students
must expect that they will receive a superior
liberal education from one of the major SUN Y
centers. The fact that an Art History major is
no longer offered in this center diminishes that
expectation. The study ofthe history of art in
fundamental requisite of liberal studies. The
intrinisic values ot'eulture must be researched
and studied. The responsibility for eliminating
such study must contend with a horizon larger
than practicality or economics. There are
silent but telling monuments that represent the
greatness of what man aspires to and achieves.
They mark what is highest in man. They repre-
sent truth. And it is the destruction of truth
that marks our horizon.

a special
thank-you

To the Editor:

On behalf of the Student Health Service, I
would like to.write an open letter of gratitude
to all those individuals and groups who
assisted us in setting up the swine flu program
held in the Campus Center Ballroom on Nov.
l7. l8 and I9. We are particularly appreciative
of the assistance given us by the volunteers.
faculty wives. nursing students and Five
Quad. Likewise we are indebted to Alice Cor-
bin and her Campus Centerstaffand members
of the Residence staff. We were assisted by the
campus press—ASP, especially Florrie
Shertzer, the Tower Tribune. and our radio
station, WSUA. I must also publicly express
appreciation to my own staff of physicians and
nurses and our student drivers who worked
long hours on the program and are not yet
finished.

This was a very reassuring demonstration of
community effort and we are deeply grateful.

‘ act. The ""“r 0"“

 

Freedom of the Press? ' ; r _ f , ,
The bicentennial year is coming to an end. Andlso toowill  "
fireworks and parades, the front lawn flags and television speckle. But

 

as the ceremonies vanish, the principles underlyingthe celebra’tioti’i'n

emerge renewed in strength. Among those principles ‘is freedom of the, i

press. . .
The student senate of the SUN Y College at Potsdam last month

invoked restrictions on the student press there in the name of freedom of g

the press. This is,a strange paradox, since the senate's resolution serves
onlyto hinder that freedom. ' I r a

The. senate's restrictions strip the paper’s editors of powers essential to
the publication's journalistic integrity. The restrictions support a type of
freedom, in the sense that students will freely be able to have their
material published. At the same time, however, they shatter the
newspaper‘s constitutional right to function as a truly free press.

It is a journalist’s responsibility, it newspaper's responsibility, to
discover and transmit the truth. Inherent in that responsibility is the task
of deciding what is, and what is not. the truth. The student senate at
Potsdam is telling the editors that they will no longer be able to make
that decision. The senate resolution dictates that anything submitted by
any student, providing it appears legal, must be printed. So who needs
editors? They just need a libel lawyer to review the articles before they’re
run-off.

A newspaper must be free to objectively report on news items its
editors deem relevant to its readership. To avoid bias, distortion and
confusion, decisions concerning what is covered and how it is covered
must rest with the editors, not with arms of the government, individual
students, or specific interest groups.

Certainly a student newspaper should strive to reflect varying points
of view in its opinion pages and promote student contributions. But take
away a paper’s editorial sovereignty, its ability to sift through the
garbage and extract the truth, to discriminate between fact and opinion,
and what will remain is an opinion sheet—an opinion sheet which
pretends to be a newspaper, which has no credibility, and which
befuddles its readers with contradictory fabrications of the truth.

A newspaper must make its own content decisions. Newspapers which

make such decisions poorly are poor newspapers. Publications which

make no such decisions at all aren’t newspapers.

Perhaps there will be some freedom at Potsdam. Students will have
their material published. But there will be no freedom of the press, simp-
ly because there will be no press.
