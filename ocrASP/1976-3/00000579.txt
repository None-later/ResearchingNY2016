Years of Experience

Completing the event for Albany
was Julie Acton who showed how
four years of experience have nur-
tured her natural ability. In scoringa
8.2 on the better vault of her two
attempts. she showed great height,
speed and control. In this. their
strongest event. the Danettes‘ best
three vaults out of four gave them a
total of 24 points as compared to
New Paltz's weak 17 point total.

“We are traditionally stronger
than New Paltz." said Coach Edith
Cobane. “And so today we gave
some of our new additions a chance
to perform competitively for the first
time."

On the uneven parallel bars,
Hilary Kaufman marked up her first
competitive score in her gymnastic
career with a promising 3.8. Lorris

: Take

by Rich Sellgeon . ‘

Freshman 6‘1" guard Lynn
Pinkston of the Albany J.V. Pups
made use of a great opportunity last
Saturday night. With one second
remaining against R.P.l. at the Un-
iversity Uym.‘ Pinkston took full ad-
vantage of' the new dunk rule in
college games, and ‘slammed it
down' to conclude a 69-58 comeback
victory for the Pups. 'I'he win.added
to last Thursday's victory over
Marist, 91-85. provided Albany with
an early season 2-0 record.

Albany's Rich Woods blocked
R.P.l.'s ’I'om Schwitter's attempted
jumper with live seconds to be
played in the contest. 'l‘hen. guard
Keith Williams of the Pups
recovered the ball. and threw a
perfect over-the-shoulder pass to
l'inkston, who dribbled down the
court and stuffed the ball. drawing
loud cheers and applause from the
partisan fans.

This was the climax of a three
minute surge by the Pups. who for
the previous 37 minutes were “horri-
hle“ according to head coach Bill
Austin. Austin commented on the
final second dunk. “It was a nice way
to end the game. especially the way it
was played; it dragged and dragged."

Albany trailed at the half by eight
points. 32-24. Poor shots. turnovers
and disorganization all contributed
to lackluster play by the Pups. RPl‘s
George Rogers and Ed Meyer kept
the Engineers ahead with fine out-
side shooting.

anything right prompted Austin to
call a badly needed time-out with
7:09 left in the half. The Pups were
behind 26-16. and RPI was on an
eight point splurge.

Finally. with 5:44 left. the Pups
ended their scoring drought. as fleet
Craig Fields hit a short jumper.
Albany narrowed the gap to four.
28-24. with 2:52 left. but Rogers
wasted no time and scored from the
outside, and the Pups went into the
lockerroom trailing.

The real excitement began with
only 4:44 left in the contest. as Keith
Williams led Woods who converted
the pass into a pretty reverse lay-up.
‘I'his put the Pups within two, 52-50.
Fouled on the play by RPI 6‘7"
center John Wurstcr. Woods went to
the line and completed the three

throughout the game. Albany finally
took the lead. 53-52. when f’inkston
hit from outstde with 3:30 left. A
pressing man-to-man defense helped
the I’ups forge ahead of the
Engineers.

Rl‘l‘s last bucket of the night was
on a jumper by Schwitter with 1:06
left. Albany looked their sharpest in
the final minute as they reeled off
seven unanswered points. A great
pass by Franz to Pinkston. who
scored all of his nine potnts in the se-
cond half. put the Pups ahead 67-58.

In the Pups' first victory of the
year over Marist. the last few
minutes of the game were also the
