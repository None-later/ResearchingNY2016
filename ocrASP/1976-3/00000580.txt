opened their’l916i77 season at home
with a "13-85 Victory over Marist —
despite the absence ofsenior starters

Cortland.

Sauers. it was only the beginning.
"We've got a long way to go." he
said. But. for Albany. at least. it
wasn‘t a bad way to start.

For Marist. Thursday night's con-
test .went exceptionally well — for
the first half. The Red Foxes started
with'a bang when center Neil Le-
jeunesse hit a driving bucket and
teammates John Cogswell and
Oliver, Jones followed with hoops to
give thern an early 6-0 lead.

Albany's Winston Royal scored
the first Dane points of the season
with two free throws. but that was
quickly countered by two Jones foul
shots. Both teams traded a pair of
buckets before Albany forward

Albany kept attempting to rally

but saw every basketeountered by a'

hot-shooting Marist squad. When
the dust had clearedat the end of
that first half. the Red boxes were on
top with a comfortable  lead.
Albany had plenty of trouble trying
to get inside ’the tough Marist
defense. while the Red Foxes seemed
to be penetrating at will on offense.
The statistics showed that Marist
had shot an incredible 73 per cent
from the floor in that half. Cogswell
and Urimes each went 5 for 7 while
Lajeunesse connected on six of his
nine shots — most of them from in
close.

But things began to change after
the intermission. Cavanaugh started
it for Albany when he connected on a

' turn-around jumper to open the se-

cond half. Lajeunesse got half ofthat
back when he hit a free-throw to
keep Marist at nine. But that was to
be the only point the visitors would
score the next seven full minutes!

After the free-throw. Albany‘s Vic
Cesare fouled on a fast break. sunk a

their way to an astonishing 2| con-
secutive points!

Brothers Spark Swim Team

'l'he Ron White-coached Albany
State men's swimming team opened
it's l976-77 regular season this past
Saturday on the road with a decisive
77-34 victory over New l’altz.

“We have one atom best teams in
the making this year." said an im-
pressed Coach White. Albany placed
first in eleven of thirteen mm. and
a number of good early season times
were turned in.

The Rubin brothers paced the
wave of State successes. Mitch
Rubin led the field in the ZOO-yd.
butterfly and the Silo-yd. freestyle.
and added his personal best while

finishing third in the l000-yd.
freestyle.

First place in that same event
belonged to Dave Rubin, whose

of the season, but 2| second-s off his
school record. He recorded his so.

400-yd. freestyle relay team. The
other members of that team were
Steve Bookbinder. Stefan Strains.
and Mark Jaff'c.

Jaffe also entered the blue ribbon
column as he posted a :58.2 to win
the 100 yd. freestyle.

'lim McCarthy. Jeff Cohen. Ed
Watkins. and Mike Dwycr were
responsible for the Danes‘ winning
time of'4:l 1.8 in the 400-yd. medley

be fatal for the Foxes. With the 6-6

constant pos'sessionhof the ball.

the Danes' comeback, according to
Coach Sauers. wl'heir experience
made them tighten up when the
game got close." he said.

In any case. the ballgame was soon
out of reach. After Cavanaugh con-
verted off an offensive rebound,
Kevin Keane hit a driving layup to
tie the game at 57. Winstonthen con-
nected twice. Royal made a three-
point play and the Danes were never
headed.

It was with if minutes left in the
game that Marist finally broke the
streak, when Walter Janeczek sunk
two free throws. But by then it was
all over. Albany had foundthe range
and was passing the ball very well at
that point — finding the open man
under the basket on numerous oc-
casions.

Marist came only as close as nine—
at 73-64 — before the Danes broke
away for good. Guards Royal and
Mike Suprunowicz were being
fouled at all turns as the Foxes
desperately tried to get the ball back.

win easily — the only question being
who would score the l00th point.
Carmelo Verdejo had the honor
when he hit a turn-around bank shot
with 27 seconds remaining.

Both Suprunowicz and Royal
ended up with 20 points as eachcon-
verted ten free throws: the former on
ten of ten. the latter on ten oftwelve.
Lajeunesse (il- l 2 from the floor). was
Marist‘s top scorer. also with 20.

Buddy [Weklinski] helped. and I
think Keane was a big factor in the
game."

No big factor was necessary in the
Cortland affair. Albany was simply
the better team. Cesare began things
with a give-and-go basket off a
Suprunowicz pass underneath for a
layup and Royal hit two free throws
to give Albany a 6-2 lead.

Grapplers Drop Two

by Eddie Emerman

The Albany State varsity wrestl-
ing team opened its l976-77 season
Saturday in a quadrangular match at
home. The grapplers captured one
match out of a possible three.

The freshmen-dominated Danes
first faced the team from Oneonta.
Albany managed to win only three of
ten individual matches and lost by a
final score of 30 to 9.

Albany‘s assistant coach Joe
Ualea was disappointed with the
team‘s performance and felt they
could have done better. Gales.
however. pointed out that six of the
ten who wrestled never wrestled in
college before and there is a big ad-

justment that has to be made from
high school to college wrestling.
Individual Winners

The individual winners for Albany
were co-captain Vic Uagliardi. co-
cuptain l’etc l’alkovic. and Earl Jor-
dun.

(iagliardi. a senior and three time
lctterman. defeated 'I'ony f’etrucci

naround and handily won this match
32-9. The victory was the team's first
since the l974-76 season. '

Albany led by a score of 25-0
before Sam Uravini pinned Jeff
Aronowitz to put RPl on the score
board. Cafes and Head Coach Joe
Uarcia were extremely pleased with
the team's performance.

The winners for Albany were l’aul
Ucmmiti (l Ill) by forfeit. Marc
Dailey (126). Howie Berger (l34).
Uagliardi. l'alkovlc. Mike William-
son (ISll). Jordan. and Tom Cleary
(heavyweight). ’l'he victories for
Uemmiti. Dailey. Berger. and
Williamson were their first as
colfegians.

Berger. a two time Section ll
champion in high school. displayed
his exceptional wrestling skill
against Chris Drance. He defeated
Drance 22-4 and nearly pinned him
on many occasions.

Union was Albany's third oppo-
nent ofthe quadrangular match. Un-
ion had already won its first two
matches by defeating Rl'l 32-9 and
Oneonta 29-l5.

Union's head coach Warren

they had a lead.

Point System

For those who don't know how
team scores are kept. here is a
breakdown of how points are award-
cd: 'I‘wo points are given to each
team if there is a draw while three
points are awarded if life wrestler
wins a decision by less than eight
points. If the decision is eight to
eleven points. the winner's team
gains four poittts. A decision of
twelve or more points earns the team
five points. When a wrestler pins his
opponent. six points are awarded
and a forfeit results in six points for
the opponent.

Albany's next match is tomorrow
night against Cortland. at home at 7
pm.

“They told me to go ahead and
sue." said Jim Eller. one of the two
students who recently had over SI.-
000 in valuables taken from their
rooms at the Wellington Hotel.

Ellcr said this was the hotel
management‘s reply to his demand
for compensation fo the television.
turntable and amplifier stolen from
his room.

"50.“ continued Eller. "i told
them I would sue.“

The Wellington is owned by the
city of'Albttny. so a plaintiff must file
a notice of claim against the
municipality hc sues. Thus it may be
a while before Eller brings his suit to
court.

Rick Cortreneo. who returned
from 'i‘hiinksgiving vacation to find
his stereo receiver and two speakers
missing. also intends to sue.

Building Supervisor Ruben Ger-
showilr. pointed out Section J of the
hotel's housing contract. which
reads flS follows:

“The Wellington Hotel is not
responsible for loss of or damage to
the personal property of occupants.
Students arc urged to provide for the
security of their belongings by lock-
ing their rooms and carrying per-
sonal property insurancc. The Hotel
also provides it safe for the storage of
valuables." ,

' Not Hotel‘s Liability

(icrshowitl commented. “it
specifically states in the contract that
thefts are not our liability."

Last year's contract did not cott-
tttin this clause. informed (Jer-
sltowitz. Ucrshowitz said that Sec-
liott J had been added on after the
payment of restitution to students
who had over $2,000 worth of
valuables stolen during the l975-7b
winter break.

Wh'ﬂﬂﬁﬁiﬂmw

“You can‘t expect the city to keep
paying out money." said Get-
showitz.

Director of Student Housing .lohn
Welty agreed with Gershowitz. say-
ing. “I don't see the basis for a valid
claim . . . It appears the hotel was
not responsible for contributing to
the thefts.“

Weltycxplainedthatatthetimeof
the previous robbery. the rooms had
been left open for rcpairmen. He
pointed out that during the recent
holiday the rooms were kept locked.

Despite the language ofthe hous-
ing contract. both of the students
robbed said they feel the hotel has a
responsibility to take reasonable
care of its occupants' belongings.

Corttcnco observed that last year
the hotel was reluctant at first to
award restitution, but did so after
students pressed their complaints.
The pair said they hope the same
thing happens this time.

Chance of Winning

According to Alan Adlcr. a clerk
at the Rosenblum-Leventhal law of—
fices retained by Student Associa-
tion. the students have a chance of
winning a lawsuit.

Said Adler. “On the basis of the
facts as presented by the students.
this is a cause of action against the
landlord."

After two major thefts within a
year. some students have questioned
the security system at the
Wellington. Cortrcnco cited in-
stances where friends entered his
locked hotel room after obtaining a
key at the main desk or from the hall
maid with no questions asked.

According to a notice passed out
by Wellington RA Fred Litt. some of
the precautions to be taken by the
hotel to prevent burglaries from oc-
curing during intcrsession arc:

 

Theft Victims Plan"  Hotel.

0all rooms will be double locked
beginning Friday. Dee-24 at 7 pm.
Ono one will be allowed to reenter

‘ room until Thursday. Jan. l3. l977.

Ostudents will be able to leave
their valuables in it separate locked
storage room.

The hotel also said a locksmith is
being consulted to determine the
best way to safeguard hotel doors
from forcible entry by credit cards
and cont hangers.

Gcrshowitz stressed the respon-
sibility of students for their own
belongings. He said many thefts oc-
cur when residents lcavc their rooms
unlocked when visiting a friend
elsewhere in the hotel.

Manpowor shortages. the inclu-
sion of CUNY students into TAP,
problems with the new emancipated
student applications. computer
failures. and the action of the state
legislature in regards to TAP,
eligibility have all been cited by
HESC President Eileen Dickinson
as prime factors contributing to the
problem.

The subcommittee will conduct
the last of its three scheduled
meetings in Syracuse on Monday.
According to Roth. the subcom-

mittee is expected to have a report
ready for the legislature at the begin-
ning of its next session.

According to a memo issued Nov.
l2 by Dickinson to college ﬁnancial
aids offices. of the 305.000
applications received from all
colleges (excluding CUNY). only
|36.000 awards have been sent to
students.

To date. HESC has processed
236.000 of the “4.90” applications.
leaving about 25 per cent pending.
“We're processing about six to seven
thousand applications a day now."
said HESC Data Processing Direc-
tor David Perry. "We now have no
substantial backlog."

HESC Vice President Graeme
Baxter cites the addition of 48 new
employees during the last three
weeks as providing the extra man-
power needed to cut down on the
corporation‘s backlog. "We've been
able to award 44.000 certificates
since Nov. 20." said Baxter.

Many students have been hit by
the TAP mix-up. but the institutions
themselves have also suffered.
Hardest hit are the private colleges
that rely on a steady cash flow

“These students [George DeLuca.
Monica Leonards. Ralph Folk and
Ellen Deutschman] pressed for an
apartment and got to his sym-
pathies.“ said Roe about Rickman.
"That doesn‘t excuse him for the
violations."

Two of the residents saidthat suits
against both the landlords and the
City of Albany for negligence were
being considcred.

Leonards and DcLuca saidthat as
far its they knew. the city had never
inspected 43A Dove St. for code
violations. '

“They‘re trying to burn Rickman
iii this case and solve code enforce-
ment [violations].“ said Lconnrds.

Roe said the city could not be held
liable for damages suffered by
residents in the fire because it did not
know anyone was living in the con-
demned building.

Rickmttn also owns property at 83
South Lake St.. 16! Lancaster St.
and 163 Lancaster St.. according to
the city nsscssor‘s office.

Roc said those buildings will be in-
spected for code violations within
the next few days.

it‘s dumb to have so manylawyers
in the case."'said Tony Cheh of the
Albany Coalition for Code Enforce-
ment. Cheh added. “it adds conﬂict
and confusion to the case with in-
creased numbers involved in legal
aspects of it.”

“There's no real conflict of in-
terests with more lawyers." said_
Kietzman. He said that it'sjust two
more mouths asking questions and
increased logistical complexity.

Cheh and a number of' other
Coalition members have said they
were aware that people were livingst
48A Dove St. before the ﬁre broke
out. Roe said anyone who knew they
were living at 48A Dove St. should
have come forward and told the city.
