The students geefully wade into

Book Aids Dorm Food Blues

American’s annual waste): and that
middle class families throw away
more than the rich or the poor.

Students have also branched out
from the study of garbage. Like
archeoiogical sleuths traipsing
through ancient Mayan villages,
they have poked through numerous
corners of Tucson studying every
aspect of contemporary material
culture. “We get really blame
studies." says Ratbje.

One student last year did a study
correlating people's use of ketchup
with the way they dressed. Entitled

Medicaid Program Under Fire

WASHINGTON (AP) A report
describing Medicaid health care of
poor children in the South as “a
national disgrace and an inexcusable
waste“ prompted an inﬂuential con-
gressman Wednesday to threaten to
abolish the program.

Unless the nine~year~old program
meets its obligation to screen 13
million poor children and treat their
medical problems. Rep. John E.
Moss. D—Calif.. said he would
attempt to kill it.

Moss did not state what legislative
strategy he might employ to abolish
the program. He blamed the
program‘s failure on bureaucratic in-
cptitude.

Implement Regulations

He criticized Secretary David
Mathews of Health. Education and
Welfare for failing to implement new
Medicaid regulations proposed In
August l97o. and said that the
former l‘nitersity of Alabama preki-
dent has "an unusually high
tolerance for doing nothing . . .

New markets have caused textbook Industry to take an upward awlng.

 

 

(CPS) When students bedn studying

for their first economics exam.
chances are they will overlook one
very rich lesson in basic supply and
demand theory. That textbook. for
which the student has probably
supplied between SI] to SIS. is hap-
pily and steadily filling the
publisher‘s demand.

The textbook industry is a finan-
cial oasis in the publishing business
as new markets open up in adult
education. women‘s studies and text
which one leading publisher says are
down-shifted for the increasing
number of junior colleges. com-
munity colleges and night school
courses. There is also a “return to
basics in education philosophy in
1976.“ reports Jim Bradford at
Scott. Foresmttn and Co. publishers.

This trend marks it change from
the past five years. "In l97l. we were
still in Vietnam. Today. students are
more interested in what this course

GOP Blasts Budget Projections

legislative Republicans reacted to

It is normal at this time of year.
about a month before formal presen-
tation of the governor‘s budget. for
the two pttrlics to slttrl haggling in
public about Wlllll should or should
not be in the budget. This haggling
generally lays the groundwork for
partisan lights to come.

There is a general agreement
between the two pttrlics that the
currcnl year's budget. which plots
the state spending through March.
will end up with a deficit ofovcr $200
million. mainly because of higher-
than—cxpccted welfare costs.

Durycu. often considered more
conservative than Anderson and a
likely GOP candidate for governor
in I978. said that the Republicans
will present a unified proposal for
cutting welfare costs.

But he said the proposal would
not include an across-tbc-board cut
in grants, something that Anderson
has already endorsed.

Duryca said the GOI’ plan would
put it “ceiling on welfare costs."

with the world. There is a'focus on
the consumer side of economics."
Bradford said.

Textbooks are being geared more
towards practical education. Today
a student can open a textbook and
learn how to borrow money fora
new car. finance a house. or even
balance a checkbook. instead ofcon-
fronting one htutdrcd years of
historical data. In fact. the all-time
best-seller on the college textbook
charts is a volume called Accounting
Principles by C. Rollin Niswonger
and Phillip C. Fess which has been
on the list for 2444 weeks and is in its
eleventh edition. And for anyone
who thought that textbooks existed
only for that rare student who is
adept Ill memorizing dates and
figures. Prentice Hull publishers put
out a text called Life rrsurmrcc that
has been selling steadily since l9l2.
The new edition is priced at $I5.95
and is expected to sell 25.000 copies
in I976.

But the words “new edition" are
enough to bring tears to the eyes ofu
student taking introductory courses
like economics or politicul science.
These courses often require texts
which are revised regularly and that
means that n‘studcnt cannot buy the
book used and possibly save us much
as fifty percent.

For the publisher. though. the
used book business is it pain in the
profits. In fact. one of the main
reasons for revisions. according to 11
leading college textbook publisher.
is to cut out the used book market.
Apparently there is no money for
publishers in used books.

Barnes and Noble. which operates
used book franchises. buys books
back at 40 percent of the original
cost and rcsclls them at 60 percent.
The author of the book being resold
receives no royalties as songwriters
do.

The publisher of the college text-
book must also deal with an in-
teresting form of rip-off. that of the
free sample. Periodically. publishers
will distribute thousands of com—
plimentary books to professors for
possible sales or reviews. However.
these books are often sold tothc used
book dealer.

  
 
 
 
  
    
  
  
 
   
 
 
  

 
  
  
 
  

  
 

heart a publisher between :3 nd
$5 to give hway a in text.for e
ple.‘ and often‘that text en p I.
the eyecatebing table marked 60 to
70 cents. Scott. Foresmln and Cot r
recently gave away nearly 10,009"
copies of a new biology text but‘lt
turned out to be a fruitless endeavor.
A source at the publishing compariy
reported that these complimentary
editions would probably be sold by
the professors for their own profit
and cited one instance in whichsam-
ple hooks Were sold to finance par-
ties.

Nevertheless. publishing com-
panies are still priming the textbook
market by giving an average advance
on a college textbook of $5000 and
royalty payments are being doled
out at a rate of IS percent.

There is one encouraging move-
ment by publishers to make text-
books more responsive to classroom
audiences. They are encouraging a
collaboration between the
professionally recognized author
and the professor at the small com-
ntunity college who is more familiar
with his or her classroom audience
than the professional. but those
writing ability often keeps that
teacher out of the textbook field.
