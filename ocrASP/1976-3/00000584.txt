by Dan” Gainer

Let's say you wanted to construct a
building. You. knew there were many
possibilities, but you decided that another

buildingfor athletics would be a nice addition .

to SUNYA. You call it a ﬁeldhouse.

The university has no money for a
fieldhouse. The, Student Association has no
money for a " "L And the |' ‘ ' y
Auxiliary Services (UAS-food service) has no
money-for a fieldhouse. You don't think you
can get a foundation to pay for it. How doyou
build it?

You decide that if you were to take 827 each
year. for 20 years. from every SUNYA stu-
dent, you could build it. You find out that the
present student body could probably legally
bind the next twenty classes of students to pay
for your ieldhouse. You gather all‘the impor-
tant people in the university and convince
them that a fieldhouse would be nice. You in-
clude Vice President of Business and Finance.
the Dean of Student Affairs. the General
Manager of UAS. the ofﬁcers of Student
Association, and officials from the plant
department, student recreational groups. and
the gymnasium.

You show them beautiful slides. films and
pictures of another college‘s ﬁeldhouse. They
look at the buildingand imagine it at SUNYA.
They begin to get excited about having a
SUNYA fieldhouse.

When people begin to wonder whether or
not you can have concerts in the fieldhouse.
you invite them to your meetings. convince
them that your fieldhouse would be a nice
place for concerts, and ask them to join the
committee.

After all these important people are on your
fieldhouse committee, you prepare a proposal.
Some of the important people volunteer
publicity money from their budgets. You go to
SA‘s Central Council. which spends student
tax money and ask that they authorize a
referendum, and help fund the publicity. You
need the referendum, but before you actually
go to the Council, you hold a series of informal
meetings with small numbers of Council
members so as to indoctrinate them. Let‘s say
Council gives you the money and authorizes
the referendum.

Your referendum proposal requires that a

certain percentage of the student body come
out and vote on it. You prepare to use your
publicity money to educate students on the
subject of the ﬁeldhouse. so they, too, can get
excited about it.

Many people on your committee are in
charge of different parts of the campus. As a
result. several details needed for your
r "a success are handled conveniently.
Free computer time and lists of students from
the registrar come more easily; so does the
publicity money.

By the time the referendum comes, in the
spring. several students will know about the
idea of the fieldhouse. It is a glamorous idea.
The $27 will not be retroactive, thus it will not
cost the voting students a great deal. Present
Freshmen and Sophomores will be able to use
thef'ieldhouse before they graduate. If you're
lucky, the students will vote favorably. in large
numbers. Then you have another problem.

Is there a bank which will finance your pro-
ject? It is a possibility, but you must show
proof that you can raise the money. It will be
difficult to offer the bank collateral; the land is
state land. But you‘ll work out that problem,
too.

After much work and the aid of many im-
portant people, the university may get a
fieldhouse. Some students will be very happy.
Then you can begin another project. using stu-
dent pockets as your ﬁnancial base.

by Dr. Janet Hood, M.D.

With the University reluctant to assess a fee
of even SI per student, per semester, to main-
tain Student Health Services which are basic,
and to obviate the necessity for multiple small
nuisance charges costly to administer. it seems
incredible that they might be willing to com-
mit students for the next 20 years to a man-
datory fee of Sl3.50 per rL'IIICSIcr fora field
house!

censorship
questioned

To the Editor:

Since the “Potsdam Press" article made
front page news in the Dec. 7 issue of ASP.
perhaps you will think more about your own
censorship and discrimination policies. You
print a “welcome of letters" on your editorial
pages, yet have been consistently criminal in
your non-publication of letters from the US.
Labor Party. an organization that has typed
and submitted, as required, letters to the
editor. including a refutation to your
slanderous articles on the USLP.

At present, world history is being made by
the USLP and our pro-constitutional allies in
the Conservative, Republican. and American
and American Independent political parties in
the US. A Federal court suit challenging
Carter‘s fraudulent election has reached
evidentiary hearing status in N.Y. In Ohio,
Ted Brown. Secretary of State, has ordered a
statewide fraud investigation “to preserve the
people‘s confidence in the electoral process.“
In Wisconsin, ajoint suit has been filed to bar
certification of the electors.

The success of the US. vote fraud action is
being wielded by our pro-development allies
internationally. As a result of on-going
negotiations between the industrialized
nations and the Third World, strong support
from Western Europe has emerged foraThird
World debt moratorium and a new monetary
system to restart world trade and production.
All this despite Rockefeller Iackcy Kissinger‘s
continued attempts of sabotage! The response
ofthe rest ofthe world to Carter's vote fraud
and his monetarist backers plans for austerity
and war is negative. The European and Third
World press have depicted Carter advisors
Cyrus Vance, who engineered the escalation of
the Vietnam War. and James Schlesinger, a
'limitcd nuclear war' maniac, as “Rockefeller

controlled."
We in the U.S. hich a heritage from the

Hamilton were committed to policies based on
the necessity of expansion of per Cllpita
wealth. In opposition stand the Hapshurgs.
Fuggers, Vichers, Rothschilds, Roekefellcrti~~
a legacy committed to looting and genocide to
create wealth.

Once again we must create theenvironmcnt
of progress and throw out the traitors who
want to de-industrialize and de-populntc the
world. Debt moratorium on the bankrupt
Wall St. banks and world developmentnuw.

misinformation
results
in mess-up

To the Editor:

I was extremely upset by the ilrIlCiL‘ tn
Tuesday‘s ASP entitled “Letters Hope to In-
fluence Budget." I had hoped that the article
would be informative and educate the rcudcis
as to the budgetary process and SI‘VY,
however, there was much misinformation and
misinterpretation hy the :iuthoi that
prevented this from happening.

I never said that the rally last Mutt-Ii ill lilt'
Capitol was a failure and I also never sand that
it was CUNY's fault. What I did say \\‘il\lillll
the rally was not as successful as it could hatt-
been and this was partially due to Sit \i' llllti
CUNY having different reasons lot lit-tug
there (we Were fighting against an lllclL‘tlw tn

plementtition of any tuition).
