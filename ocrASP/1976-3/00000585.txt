By THOMAS MORMILE

When the glacial lake which
covered the City of Albany. drained
into the Atlantic Ocean. it left
behind a thick layer of sand above a
layer of impermeable clay. Winds
blew the sand around. forming large
dunes five to seventy-five feet high,
ranging from one hundredtoa thou-
sand feet long.

Vegetation covered the dunes
protecting them from high winds.
making them stable. Pitch pines
became the dominant tree species
and scrub oak covered the sand.

Over the past few hundred years
the Pine Bush went from forty
square miles of rolling dune. to less
than four thousand acres of land.
lhc l'ine Bush is another mime for
an ecosystem commonly called the
Pine Barrens.

lhe majority of the Pine Bush
presently lies Within the City of
Albany and the towns of
Uutlderland and Colonic. Now the
ecosystem is being threatened by
housing projects. since the Pine Bush
is the last part of these towns capable
of such development.

lhe l’ine Bush is a unique
ecosystem. Many til the animals
which adapted to it are not found
anywhere else in the Northeast.

By MIKE I'IEKARSKI

Anyone remember the campus
barber shop? You know. the place
that Student Association kcpt com-
plaining about last year. claiming
only the faculty used it‘! Remember
how it was tiitccremoniously remov-
ed from its campus ccntcr location
and left for dead among the
labyrintlts of the podium ttinncls
to make room for a “strident
oricnlcd" lootl co-op‘!

Well. you can save yottr wreaths
illltl ctilogics; Ilic barbershop doesn't
need them. "’I’lie worst is over." cx-
plains Dan (iiitto. one of the two
relocated barber's til the U niycrsity
Barber Shop. "We’re doing fine
now.“

llcttcr than that. Business has tic-
tutilly im/irut'i'tl since the switch,
And not because of an increase in
faculty tisc. "Seventy-live per cent of
otir business is students." says
Gallo.

Ted Morell. (jatlo‘s long-time
partner in the enterprise agrees. and
adds. "Business has been better." But
why'.’ u'l'hcy (the cnstoiiicrs) like the
secltnion. There (at the Campus

(iatto concurs with that analysis.

careful not to upset his young
customer sitting in the bnrbcr chair.
“'I licy'i'c not goingto be seen by peo-

Such was not the case only it year
ago. l‘i'ont January I4. I907 to

Barber Shop had been handling
customers iii the basement of the

there were four biirbers llicti. Now

Some of these include the Eastern
spedef'oot toad. the praire Warbler.
and the Siamese mole.

The Pine Bush is also unique in be-
ing the only home in the world ofthe
Karner Blue butterfly. First dis-
covered in the ltloil‘s. the Karner
Blue was classified as a seperate
spectes by Dr. Vladamir Nabokov.
the renowned lepidopterist and
novelist. in I944.

Don Rittner. the historic sites
archeologist for the City of Albany
said. “Havmg the Karner Blue is like
havmg a Grand Canyon. It may not
be as big or its magnificent;
nevertheless. it is one of it kind. l'his
alone is a major reason to save the
Pine Bush."

()nc ol the ways the ecosystem has
been affected was through sand min-
iiig. Siind mining in the Pine Bush
began iii earnest towards the end of
the nineteenth century when foun-
dries in Albany used the soil for
molding sands. A recent controversy
involved a grading contractor that
was taking sand from the dunes to be
used as a landfill for a post office in
Colonic. I he contractor never filed
an cnvtronmcntal iinpiict statement.
lltts was in Violation of the state
mining law that says you must have a
permit and must also explain your

intentions before you start to mine.

The town of Uuilderland'handed
the contractor an injunction to
appear in court but a decision was
never reached. Finally the case was
brought before Supreme Court of'
New York. During the trial that en-
sued. John Forst. the original owner
of the land who sold the mining
rights to the contractor. was
questioned at the trial.

Mr. Petersen. the chairman of the
eastern chapter ot'the nature conser-
vancy. who was at the trial said. “He
(Forst) claimed that he was im-
proving the grade of iris land down
to road level.“ there is in fact it law
which permits you to do this.
Whether that law applies here has
yet to be decided as the trial is still in
progress.

As the court battle on sand mining
conttniics. tltc l'iiie Bush is being
threatened more seriously by laiid
developers. l’rtvtitc landowners own
a large portion of the Pine Bush; a lot
of these people sell out to construc-
tion eonipantes. Don Ritlner. the
City archeologist said the problem
Wits. “lbese people sell out because
they can't afford the high property
tax which can be its high as twenty
thousand dollars a year."

It is ironic that the destruction of

"We get. you figure. two "styles"
or three regular ltaircuts iin hour."
(iatto explains between ships. “it
usually takes a half hour per style
and 20 minutes for a regular. But

years. 'l'httl‘s why we're still in

“as it friend of mine and he asked me

Neil lirowti. the Dean ofStudciit Af-
fairs. and he told tiic the conditions
and the benefits: pension and in-
surance and things like tltttt. So I
camc. And I felt that working witlt
students and professors could im-
prove ttty own mind."

(iiilto has it certain intensity
about him. Whether working on it
particular ctit or carrying oti a con-
versation. he seems greatly concern-
ed with the results; not wanting to

risk it mistake. His ltiiir is jet-black;
thick iind almost unkempt. He ob-
viously does not cut his own.

Morell has dark brown hair and
seems to have had it styled. His
mustache. too. is trim and neat and
he dresses much more stylishly than
his partner. He does not wear a
jacket-smock like Gallo. adding to
his air of casualtiess.

But lie is not casual about the loca-
tion of'thc barbershop. He is still tip-
set about the move. "The SA presi-
dent (Andy liatinian) siiid we were
just serving the faculty. and because
of the food co-op and that. tltcy told
us to lcaive." But lie cannot escape
the fact that things are Working out
well. Still. something is missing.

“We miss the flow of traffic.“ he
says. “You don‘t get the people walk-
ing by that see us and say to
themselves. “Yeah. I could use a
haircut.‘ "

But more than locations ltave
changed. "Now styles have chang-
ed.“ says Gallo. “People in this
generation. on the whole. want to
take care of their hair better. they
want a certain style.“ And the par-
ticular hairstylingtecbitiquc is main-
ly the domain ol‘thc students. accor-
ding to him. “An older gcnt. say 50
or so. he won't usually go for a style.
But students usually will.“

'lhc pciik hair-cutting dates are
usually before vacations. “Right
now. ilicrc aren‘t as many customers
as there were last Week." says Gatto.
But they are decidedly not in a
slump. And that goes for lllcir

development may eventually
obliterate the Pure Bush altogether.
In order for the Pine Hush tosurVive
as it is. there must be periodic bur-
ntng to keep the leaf litter from
btitlding up. Without fire the tlitii
still layer becomes thickened by dy-
ing organic matter. Another plaitt
species which is better adapted to
this fertile soil layer. would invade
the Vote Bush and eventually take
over. the Pine Barrens might turn
into a more stable forest. such as
oak.

ln tltc past these tires were natural
occurranecs caused by lightning. or
perhaps by a careless settler. loday.
because houses crowd the area. a fire
poses a threat to the property of
those livmg nearby. l‘or this reason

not. are exttngmshed before they
have a chance to spread.

II the Pine Bush is to be saVed.
periodic burning must occur. One
solution is to start plunncdlires. l'his
would entail starting it fire in a given
area around which fire breaks are
dtig. lbis method of using fire has
been used successfully in New Jersey
since as early as l850.

lliroughout the history of the
Pine Bush there has always been a
concern for its preservation. in lotto.
Albany was decliircd ti chartered city
by the lznglish. in that year people
had been stealing sand which came "
. . . from a topp of ye hill where ye
old burying place has been . . ."
lhitt year a law was passed which
prohibited the removal of that sand.
and a few years later. workers replac-
ed the missing sand.

ln ltll0 an Albany resident com-
plained about the amount of wood
that was being taken from the Pine
Bush to be used as fuel for steam-
boats traveling on the Hudson
River. He remarked. “lfthis practice
is to be tolerated. what willinashort
time be the consequence."
