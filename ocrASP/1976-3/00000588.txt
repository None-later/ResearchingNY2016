Finally. it amazed me that the last
paragraph appeared at all. since it totally con-
tradicted the rest of thevarticle. It was also
totally twisted. I spoke to Joel Packer. SASU
Legislative Director. and he explained that
although the Board of Regents report was very
biasch in areas and will probably not be im-
plemcnted as written, this does not mean that
the Governor will not cut the budget a little
anyway. nor does it mean that the legislature
will not decide that there should at least be a
slight increase in SUNY's tuition. Another
point to keep in mind is that SUNY needs 60
million dollars to continue operating at its pre-
sent insuflicicnt level (this is due to cost of liv-
ing increases and interest on debt service
bonds) so even if our budget is not actually
cut, we will need to make up an additional 60
million which will undoubtedly come from
our pockets.

It is unfortunate that this did not come out
in the article, where it belonged. I would hope
that in the future the author and the ASPwiII
try to present all the information on a subject
and do it correctly.

the problem
with zionism

To the Editor:

Let‘s set tiie record straight. In the Nov. I2
ASP, the ad for Israel Awareness Week
specifically said. “SA funded." In my concern
for seeking the truth. I read this as well as the
letter from the .Iewish Students Coalition
published several weeks ago. Part of this
“awareness” included denunciations and
even slanders about legitimiite Arab
governments» something which most of us
would say constitutes “political activity."

Then there is the matter of my “distinct lack
of historical knowledge and insight.“ Back in
I‘l7l. l was arrested with Meir Kuhune (and
800 others) for sitting in front of the Russian
iimbussy. Despite my staunch Zionist attitude
then. which I was willing to sacrifice my
“freedom” loi'. | IIltIlIIllIIIIL‘d ciinugli historical
knowledge. insight. and open-inindcdncss to
discover there is indeed another side to the
story of Israel. it is unfortunate that most of its
will Ilt:\’cl get u chance to see the sordid side oi
Zionism.

increase in arms for the police on campus
would like to think that a university does not
suffer the same crime~ridden woes that a city.
or any organized settlement of people. does.

It has been pointed out that SUNYA isthe

only SUNY campus which has armed police.’

SUNY at Buffalo was mentioned as one which
was considering this. I come from the Buffalo
area, and I know how inept that situation is
since there is a reliance on area police forces. It
takes precious time to respond to the many
calls that are necessitated by those criminals
on and off campus. The police forces have
enough trouble covering the vast districts
they‘re responsible for. without having the
added headache of patrolling the sizeable
SUNY Buffalo campus.

Put yourself in the place of a cop. You, and
a few others. are responsible for the welfare of
thousands ol' people on and off campus.

Is there a fear lurking in some people’s
minds that SUNYA students will then take up
arms themselves in retaliation? lfyou want to
be overly pessimistic. you could argue that
they could try to do that now. If you Were
cynical, however. you could go on to say that
maybe we should take away their patrol cars,
too.

In this case logic should overrule emotion. I
don‘t mean to advocate guns; they are indeed
powerful weapons. But the desire for pacifism.
in terms of non-violence. is being furthered.
The police. though not perfect, are extremely
well-trained. I. for one. would rather risk the
slitn possibility of a police error. than be shot
by some nerd with a weapon who got away
because he knew a local cop could not possibly
be able to stop him.

tower tribune
commits a sin

To the Editor:

The lunction of u university-Wide pllhllctl-
tion is to “avoid taking sides." Hy neglecting to
publish it cructiil resolution passed at ('cntrul
Council's meeting on Nov, I7. the lower
Iribunc is doing the bidding ol the ud~
ministration.

the resolution expressed the Coiinctl's
collective outrage itt the action of the U niversi-
t_v ('oniniiinity ('ounctl (a committee of the
llltl\L'l'\tl_\' Senate) who denied students the
right to attend the afternoon meeting ol Nov.
I7. At this meeting. the issue ol security ol-
ticcrs carrying guns on campus Wits to be dis-
cussed.

Ihe lower '1 rihune routinely publishes the
hills and resolutions passed by Central Coun-
Cli. We refuse to ttccepl that their failure to
print this particular resolution was merely an
tl\'t.'I'slglIl. iiVidently. the publishers ot the
lower lrtbunc do not consider the gun issue
important. or are reluctant to publieirc it [or
lcur ol iintugoni/ing the administration.

lhe 'l'ower lriliiine hits liillcn prey to can
sorsliip. Many students read the lower
Iribunc. this type of selective filtering does
not constitute Journalism. thus damaging this
publication's credibility.

The Precaure Is On

In the midst of all the snow, a lone student sits studying. sometimes. ‘
wantsto panic; often he does. He thinks about the optional mideterm:

 

the late paper; the incomplete grade. It seems there will never beenough
time.  .

He makes lists. There are four important things that must be finished;

within twoiweeks, and three less important ones. Then there are all the“
things that have nothing to do with school, finals or degrees.
He thinks about the coming vacation. He wonders why two weeks"

Seem like much'more. .

He wonders if he should care about grades. He wonders if there‘s any

reason for all the pressure. He wonders if he is inventing pressure — not -

everyone feels it. ' .

But he wakes up nervous in the morning, when he gets any sleep. His
stomach is tied in knots. -

He ponders asking for an extension — and spends painstaking hours
trying to figure out whether he really needs it. He imagines the
professor‘s reaction — hundreds of times. Finally he gets the extension.

Now he finds ways to spend his time away from books. He eats out.
He watches Silver Chicken at the Rat. He reads the paper. He thinks
about all the work he has to do.

He is either annoyed with or jealous of his friends. Annoyed at those
who don’t seem to care. Those who believe they don’t want the things
that grades can buy. Annoyed at those who do only what excites them.
Jealous of those who finished three courses already. Jealous of those
who claim they have no work. Jealous of those who graduated — and
those who dropped out of school and into jobs.

He wonders if he’s really learning anything. Panic is part of an
education, he figures. Is nausea?

Logically, intellectually, honestly. he knows it really doesn't matter all
that much. A course here, a grade there, he’ll never remember when he’s
30. If he could use this knowledge to relax, he‘d do better. He might even
do well. But he cannot.

Instead he worries. He suspects people are out to get him. He fells he’s
falling behind whenever he sees someone studying.

When the marks on his calendar become tomorrow, it seems as if he’ll
never make it.

But he bears down, he does what he must do.

He celebrates when it's finished.

Then he goes home, and wonders if he’s learned anything. He decides
he has. but certainly, it isn't what he expected to learn at the State
University of New York at Albany.
