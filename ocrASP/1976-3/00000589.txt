(Money: Hello, Goodbye

by Gary Parker

Student Association needs an audit.

SA is composed of approximately 8900
students, each of whom pays thirty-three
dollars a semester. This money is commonly
called a mandatory student tax.

For the year ended June 30, I976, Student
Association collected $907,269. According to
any reasonable definition of a government.
SA was obligated to spend this moneyto serve
those 8900 students.

Did they?

The information to answer that question is
not presently available. What is known is that
the total expenditures by student
organizations for the year cited above was
$887,990.

Who spends this money?

Operations of SA are for the most part in-
itiated by Central Council. Council is com—
posed of thirty-one students. one for every 350
undergraduates. In most cases. it takes less
than 100 votes for one council member to gain
a seat. With the constant turnover of student
representatives. and with the inexperience that
most SA officials have. it is very difficult for
SA to keep track of the groups' financial
dealings. Working withthc skills and advice of
professional accountants. SA could set up a
solid enough financial system to offset the lack
of long-term personnel and the resulting inex-
perience. Students would benefit if financial
waste was discovered. which Marc licnecke
has shown is. at the least. possible.

in the past several years, Student Associa-

Student Association.

tion has had ﬁnancial statements prepared by
a large accounting firm. Each year the firm
reprints figures already known to SA in a fan-
cy folder. They state at the beginning of their
report:

“The accompanying balance sheets of the
several funds of Student Association . . . and
related statements of changes in fund balances
and student organization funds revenues and
expenditures for the year then ended were not
audited by us and we express no opinion on
them.“ [emphasis is mine].

The ﬁrm‘s report has not been made public.
Even if this information was made public. SA
still would not know where the $907,269 went.

is this government meeting its ﬁduciary
responsibility to its citizenry?

Opponents of a “business-style" SA say an
audit of SA is not necessary; SA is too small,
an audit costs too much. and no one really
cares.

Each student has a right to receive a portion
of their tax in services. But there is no way for
students to know if they are receiving a fair
rcturn on their tax money. ifthe money is not
fully accounted for. Therefore. each student
has the right. and SA hasthc obligation. to ac-
count for every penny spent. and to open its
books to anyone who shows cause. including
independent auditors.

Arc SA tax monies spent responsibly?

Docs SA nccd $66 per year from each stu-
dent to provide the services it presentlydocs?

Does the present accounting system prevent
theft?

A certificd audit would answer these
qucstions. and provide useful information. Is
there going to be one?

There it lay. shattered beyond all recogni-
tion. It: member pans recalling weekends
spent emptying its parts. the former majesty
now humbly vegetating on the floor; it mark-
ed the end of my beer-can period. Three hun-
dred of them, which I had come to know quite
well (almost by sight) in the month-and-a-half
that they graced my window.

Don is clearing the debris now. muttering
about taking his Bud cans (ninety-four of
them)and building his own pyramid. He could
do a good job of it. but that is not in the spirit
of the pyramid game. All superior pyramiding
is a group effort. and l‘llnever forget the effort
our suite put forth to fill our _window with
these tributes to American ecology. I'll also
not forget the beginning when it hardly stood
four-high. and had a point of a single can of
Coors.

The Coors can is well-suited tosueh a role as
topping off a pyramid; its long slender profile
gives the entire structure a sense of
skywardness. an uplifting. It is not as long as
the Tall Boy. but longer than the average can.
and here the troubles began.

As a small pyramid. the structure claimed
an amalgam of components. beers ofall kinds.
cans of all sizes. And why not‘.’ Tea or twenty
cans could be easily rearranged to accom-
modate a new addition. and a growing
pyramid will quickly commandeer all the
nutrition it can get.

We fed it well and it grew quickly; Buds.
Millers. Coors, Tall Boys of various brands.
Maximus Supers. Rolling Rock. even l’absts.
It put on weight at an encouraging rate. There
were times when it could not ingest another
can for fear ofexploding itself. and it left them
on its night~tablc. We were feeding it more.
but we were not feeding it better. Shortened

pyramid. and the resulting imbalance took its,
toll. Barely perceptible at ﬁrst. the strapping
young pyramid soon developed alilt toithii‘
left. It fell more often; each time“ was a little"
harder for it to remount its pedestal."
Specialists were called in. They blamed poor'
digestion. “Give it more time to settle itself
after you feed it cans," they said inchorua. We
did. We placed the cans carefully. not rushing
it at all. but it was no good. Majorsurgery wn
necessary—mo matter what the specialists-
said. Partly due to my bedside manner. partly
due to my steady hands. but mostly because no
one else wanted to do it. I was chosen to per-
form the operation.

I worked carefully and slowly. realizing that
one false move could leave me covered with
pull-tabs. l realigned every row. taking great
pains to keep same-'size cans in the same rows;
Buds among Buds. Coors among Coors. Tall
Boys among themselves. All went well until
the last row. whcre three sixes competed for
the same space. “It's only the top row.“ I told
myself. “It's not serious."

The surgerydid a lot ofgood. but the lilt had
not been eliminated completely. “It will heal."
l hoped. And it could have. but forthc Christ-
mas lights. which danglcd perilously close to
the top row.

“Move it.“ I told my suitcmate, "or we'll
have a big crash."

He moved it. We had a big crash anyway.

I wonder now if I could have saved it. lfl
had only caught those first two cans and put
them back quickly! lfl had only been a better
surgeon! oh. well . . . to second-guess is
useless. Don has withdrawn his cans. and it
can never again be what it was. Thank you.
Don. for putting it out of our misery.
