‘The‘Alb‘any State varsity basket-

ball team pushed its record to 3-0'

Wednesday night by downing
Binghamton. 58-49. at the Colonials'
home court. An error'lilled second
half saw the Danes survive a ﬁve
minute scoring drought and a two-
shot technical foul on their way to
their first victory'on the road this
year.

During the game's ﬁrst few
minutes. Binghamton star Ted Hull
proved Albany coach Dick Sauers'
characterization of him as “the best

gguard we've yet to face.“ The 5'l0"

Hull repeatedly drove to the basket
or passed to an open teammate to
help Binghamton to an early lead.

A breakaway basket by forward
Kevin Keane. however. gave Albany
a 20-18 edge. and the Danes did not
fall behind again.

A few minutes later. forward Vic
Cesare and guard Winston Royal hit
on consecutive baskets. and after
Hull missed a forced shot from out-
side the key. center Barry
Cavanaugh connected on a ten-
footer for a 30-22 margin. Later.
when Binghamton climbed to within
two. Cavanaugh again came
through. this time with a three-point
play to make il 33-26.

Albany successfully stalled for the
last shot before intermission, as
guard Mike Suprunowicz spun
down the lane with seconds remain-
ing to hit a short jumper. The Danes
went into the lockerroom ahead 38-
30.

‘ Albany‘s halftime lead was largely
due to its superior shooting from the
floor: 56 percent to 46 percent for
Binghamton. The Danes were also
doing a good job of containing their
opponents‘ dangerous fast break.

scoring nine and 11, respectively.
As in the ﬁrst period, Albany
started off the second half sluggishly.
A .Suprunowicz bucket accounted
for Albany’s lone two points in the
first 5:38 of action. Fortunately for
the Danes. Binghamton was not ex-
actly on a rampage. netting but four
points during the same time period.

Two foul shots by Hull placed the '

Colonials within four. 40-36. with
14:00 remaining. But forward Staton
Winston’s basket off a nifty looping
pass from Winston Royal and a
Cavanaugh two-pointer gave the
Danes breathing room. A Winston-
to-Keanc aerial resulted in Albany‘s
biggest cushion of the night. 51-41.
with a little over eight minutes to go.
Playing with patient deliberation
against the Binghamton zone. the
Danes were again outshooting their
rivals.

Then came the great scoring lapse.
Albany did not put a single point on
the board for a full five minutes. but
Binghamton, not one to unduly em-
barass an opponent. could tally but
six.

Meanwhile. the comedy of errors
had begun. Keane was hacked un-
derneath to put Binghamton'over
the limit. but the Albanyjunior miss-
ed both foul shots. The Colonials
were called for a three-second viola-
tion. but Winston blew a lay-up.
Then after Hull sank two foul shots
and Cavanaugh made a great block
of a close-in shot. Binghamton
travelled. Albany then lost the ball
out-of—bounds. Cesare made a
succeeding steal but then Royal
failed on a lay-up. and the ball was
ruled out ol'l‘Albany. Binghumton‘s

 

Hull then missed on a forced.
overlong jumper. while
Suprunowicz was off .on a four
footer. And on and on.

When the dust had cleared. the
Danes found they would have to
scrap to win. When Binghamton
center Ken Levy converted a foul
shot. the score was 51-47 with 3:02
left. Cavanaugh then cooled things
off a little by sinking two foulshots.

A controversial 'call followed a
missed lay-up by Suprunowicz. The
Danes,‘ whether out of plain
frustration or a belief that
Suprunowiez had been fouled, ex-
ploded in rage. The officials
responded by slapping a two-shot
technical foul on the Albany bench.
Rich Rochon. Binghamton‘s fine
guard, hit both and Binghamton got
the ball back on a travelling viola-
tion.

It was now 53-49. Binghamton‘s
ball. less than two minutes to go.

Binghamton came down court
and put it up. Colonial forward
Larry Madiefsky grabbed the
rebound. but ran into Kevin Keane.
who came up with the play of the
game.. Keane unceremoniously
ripped the ball out of Madiefsky's
hands while the Danes proceeded to
waste the clock.

Amazingly, 53 seconds passed
while Binghamton neither got the
ball back nor pressed Albany
very hard. When Royal was finally
hacked with under 30 seconds
remaining. the game was all but
over. Royal sunk both fouls and
Albany had its third straight victory.

The spread of individual point
totals for Albany was very unusual.
Only two points separated the star-
ting l'ivc: Cavanaugh and Winston.

Women Cagers Split First Two

by Don Roast

Over the past week the Albany
State Women's basketball team
knotted their seasonal record at H.
losing to powerful Oswego State 74-
38 while whipping the College of St.
Rose by a score of 59-41.

Oaklego. the opening game oppo-
nent. proved to be very powerf u1. as
the score aptly indicated. Oswego
had a very balanced scoring attack.
with four of the live starters in dou-
ble ﬁgures. Mary Ann Shumaka of
Omega led all scorers with 16 points
and also hauled down nine
rebounds. another game high.

For Albany. Mary Ann Crotty
and Tracy Sugihara Were the top
scorers for Coach Karen Cun-
ningham’s crew with l2 points each,
Co-eaptains Mary Ellen Foley

 

(seven) and Nancy Bartle (five) also
contributed to the Danette total.
Cunningham explained that the
team played a solid offensive game,
but was unable to get back on
defense quickly enough. which
enabled Oswego to use their fast
break effectively.

“But.” Cunningham said. “we are
a very young team with a handful of
freshmen and transfers. and only
two seniors. (Bartle and Foley). It
will take a while for us to get
together. but the nucleus is diﬁnitely
there."

The College of Saint Rose was a
different story for Cunningham's
Danettes as they registered an easy
59-41 triumph at the St. Rose Gym-
nasium on Tuesday. Coach Cun-
ningham had only praise for her

team. as they hauled down 33
rebounds with Ellen Daly and Mary
Ellen Foley grabbing 10 apiece.
Super-soph Crotty pumped in 21
points, to go along with her five
rebounds and six assists. Crotty is
now leading the team in scoring with
a 16.5 scoring average. with
Sugiharu a close second at 13 points
per game. Tracy picked up 14 points
against St. Rose and also added
seven assists.

Cunningham felt that St. Rose
was a pivotal game because
“hopefully it will instill a winning
spirit that will carry through the
season. The team now knows that
they have the potential. and hopeful-
ly the demands of a rough academic
schedule will not wear the girls
down."

true. but then again Binghamton
blew its chances to win the game.
And although the play of bothtcams

was plagued with many mistakes.
Sauers took consolation in the fact
that his team did win its first away

Grapplers Bow To Cortland

by Eddie Emerson

The Albany State wrestling team
dropped ilsthird match ofthe season
to a young. tough Cortland team. 39-
12. Wednesday night at the U nivcrsi-
ty Gym.

Albany's head coach. Joe Garcia.
knew the Danes would have their
hands full against Cortland.
“Cortland has always been tough in
the conference and they have an out-
standing coach. Vince Gonino."

Albany's Paul Gemmiti and Cor-
tland's Bob Eddy wrestled in the
opening match at the 112 weight
class. Eddy dominated the first two
periods and was leading 11-] when
Gemmiti was forced to default with a
leg injury.

The next pair to wrestle was Mark
Dailey of Albany and Cortland‘a
Wade Cummings. The match was
even through the first two periods.
but Cummings was too strong for
Dailey in the ﬁnal period and won
15-7.

The match at 134 provided the
closest and most exciting battle of
the night. Albany's Howie Berger. a
freshman. was up against Pete
Rossie, who finished second in the
State University of New York
Athletic Conference Championships
last year.

Berger dominated the first period
and led 4-2. In the second period
ROIIiG evened the score up at four-
all and that's how the match ended.
However. Rossic was awarded the
victory because he had one point ex-
tra for riding time.

The Danes were now trailing 13-0
in the match. The next wrestler for
Albany was eo-cttptain Vic (iagliar—
di. l-lc pinned his opponent .loe l’cn-
nacchic at 7:41 to close Cortland‘s
lead to 13-6. It was Gagliardi's
fourth win of the season.

The fifth match featured the
Danes' other co-eaptain Pete
Palkovic and Cortland's Chris

Courne. l’alkovic. like Gagliardi.
was going for his fourth victory but
Bourne out-wrestled him and he lost
the match 11—4.

The Danes lost their next four
matches. At 158. Mike Williamson
lost to Rich Armstrong 20-4. At 167.
Cortland's Scott Agar pinned Jeff
Aronowitz at 5:30. Albany forfeited
the match at 177. then Cortland's
Bob Menz pinned Chris Covas at
4:35 to give them a 39-6 advantage.

The final match of the night was
between the heavyweights. Tom
Cleary and Cortland‘s Walt Kieda.
Cleary won his third match of the
season on a pin at 3:45 to give the
Danes their last six points.

After the match. Coach Garcia
discussed his squad. “We're a young
team but we have a lot of talent. it's
going to be a question oftime. As we
gain experience. we will put it
together.

“A problem the team faces this
year is that there aren't enough
wrestlers on the team to provide
competition during the practice."

Garcia attributes this mostly to
.student apathy. “There is plenty of
