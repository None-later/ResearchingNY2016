colors, green and white. were usedas [dent of the Junior class. and Earl

banked with evergreens and white
chrysanthemums. A large l9l9made
of white chrysanthemums. and the
large Junior banner and service flag
occupied prominent places.
Festoons of laurel and
chrysanthemums and baskets of nar-
cistus hung from the balcony. The
lights were hidden in baskets of
green and white crepe' paper and a
huge "moon" fur nished light for two
moonlight waltzes.

The student, who always knows the
college yells. and always returns
hoarse from athletic games. is til
one who is well liked byboth faculty
“eat body. He isvthe one who
is alive, who lives. not because he
chanced to be born. but because he
loves life and its interests.

In our college the majority of
rivalry games seem to be interclass.
Picture a basketball game where it is
a half minute till time is up forthe se-
cond half. The referee tossesthe ball.

‘ The score stands 8-7 in favor of the

upper classmen. Yo‘nder dishevelled
Freshman is gritting his teeth and
maki g an iron resolve to throw a
field basket. The game begins with a
rush. His teeth still are set; his heart
leaps as he catches the glorious prey
in his arms. For a bare instant he
hugs it to him. so glad is he to possess

- it. so sure of success. He bounces it

once, twice, three times. and pauses
before the basket. He slips tinder his
guard and with a bound throws the
ball. Just as the crowd sees it fall
gracefully through the net the
timekeeper‘s whistle announces that
the game is over.

There are two classes of people in
that ball and they are divided by a
line of, demarcation more distinct
than any human power could draw. I
heard a lecturer last week say that
there is no class of people divided so
distinctly as a class in geometry. This
class. he said. is divided into two
clean-cut parts —- those who see and
those who do not see. In my mind, it
is much the same at anathlctlc game.
There are those who see. and cheer;
and those who do not see. and do not
cheer. The non—cheercrs attend the
game for some unknown reason. and
do not see, do not understand, the
spirit of the game.

But the cheerers -— they of the
happy hearts and valiant lungs. who
dare and love to exhaust their voices
in landing skill. whether of their
fellows or rivals --— let us speak of
these. They are the flower of the
college; they are the alumni-to-be
who will return to almu mater in love
and reverence long after the non—
cheerers have forgotten they were
college-bred. The c‘hccrcrs are they
who later will make their names felt
and known in their native spheres.
They are the ones who. as they were
loyal to their college. will also be to
their country. Blessed ' are the
chce'rcs. for they shall be cheered.
College yells are for the students.
and of the students. therefore let
them be by the students.

' Student Council

April I8. I917

At the general meeting of all
students gathered in student
assembly last Friday morning. the
first student council in ths history of
State College was called into being.
For months a faculty committee had
the plan under consideration andth
action taken on Friday last was the
result of their labor.

Suggestions for  Rivalry

' made by Representatives

.. from Each Class

Student. Assembly. or'i Friday,
February’l‘sltlt. ‘was in charge of
Myshnia. After the singing of Alma
Mater, Mr. Joseph Walder made
several timely. announcements; The

remainder of the meeting was oc-~

cupied by speeches from represen-
tatives of each of the various classes.
in which suggestions were made con-
cerning‘theworking out of class
spirit and rivalry in college. Student
Council will consider these and will
soon present a scheme of action.

Mary Grahn. '2l, was the first
speaker. and cleverly presented the
views of the Freshman class. Accor-
ding to Miss Grahn. college is the
one place where we may properlyin-
dulge in class prejudice. The
Freshmen, too. will welcome class
rivalry. since it makes them feel they
are attending college rather than a
“teacher factory." Frosh Bibles. flag
rushes. Frosh caps. and push ball
contests were spoken of.

Lawrence McMahon, ‘20 gave a
lively talk on Sophomore views of
the matter. Rigid rules for Freshmen

are in order — instance, Freshmen .

Underelasamen should give up their
seats to‘ .up‘perclassmen and carry
their books. Freshman election
might be secret. The order of seating
in chapel might be arranged to
suggest order of classes. Freshman
sandwich men could announce to
Sophomores important class
notices.

Merrill Sauerbrei,.‘l8, described
various traditional scraps at Union.

Martin Barry, ‘2l, advocated a
Freshman Bible, and suggested Cittss
debates as a stimulant to rivalry.

Elizabeth Gardner. ’20, suggested
buttons as a means of identifying
Freshman. ,

Alfred Miller. ‘l9.'said that pipes
and mustaches should be taboocd
among underclassrncn. Seniors
should wear caps and gowns during
the second semester at college, and
faculty members when appearing in
chapel would lend an air of dignityto

\ the occasion‘ by wearing their caps.

gowns and hoods.

Dorothy Austin. 'IB. summed up
the points made. and emphasized in-
‘terclass sports.

Other ‘ excellent- remarks were
made. the trend of which was

' generally toward the construction ol

college spirit.

Walking Lunches

February 20. I 9/8

Probably many readers of the
“News” will be interested to know
that a ncwIand important dogma has
been set forth in the school of
medicine, and that this new dogma is
the product of our own Alma Mater.
One of our alumni. now a student of
medicine, has discovered a sure
remedy for indigestion: People
should stand when eating. To stand
for all three meals of the day is the
ideal of prevc ntativccurc. Our World
of busy, ovorWorkcd men. habitually
careless about health, could hardly
be expected to live up to such an
ideal. In view of this fact. a group of
medical men have decided that. if a
man stands wile he eats one of his
three daily meals. he is reasonably
safe from indigestion. How easy it is

for State College students to protect
themselves from the ravages of this
disease. since there are few places
where they can sit down to eat lunch
anyway. Let every strident resolve to
keep away from thc empty bcuchcs
in the lower hall of the Science
Building. and to walk slowly tip and
down the corridor while eating
lunch. Some people already follow
this lint: of procedure. but most of
our students are always grumbling
about no place to sit down lo cal
lunch. not even seats in the lower
hall. Dr. Quuk. visiting physician at
the new Flcxner School. has dis-
covered that grumbling itsclf in-
variably produccs indigestion. Let's
stand when we cut our lunches and
be good natured about it.

Suffrage Heard

Mart-h I4, I 9/ 7

Miss Louise (lrant, who spoke on
the Women Suffrage movement
before the College Club last Friday
afternoon. called attention to the
rapid strides the movement had
made in the western part ofthe Un-
ion and. in fact, all over the United
States and Canada. Of late Canada.
the said. has largely granted suffrage
to the women. and anti-suffrage sen-
timent has practically disappeared
there. The speaker said that in the
readjustment coming after the war
the inﬂuence of Woman would be
needed. Some readjustment in this
country will be necessary in order
that we come upto the new ideals of
a new Europe.

Miss Grant pleaded for a more cf-
flclent and centralized campaign in

ALBANY STUDENT eases

the conservative eastern states. The
women of California succeeded. she
said. through the influence of the
collcgc women‘und the Civic League.
The speaker said we live inn tremen-
dous age and do not understand it.
"Ballot is the one thing necessary
whereby all other things may be ob-
taincd. The early suffragcttcs work-
ed for higher education for women.
therefore. college women owe a debt
to the movement. Miss Grunt ut-
tackcd conservatism. calling it fear
of change and saying that it caused
inti-suffrugc sentiment.

College pro-suffrage leagues are
being organized among the under
graduates of most colleges for the
purpose of working for the move-
ment on its last road to victory.

DECEMBER 14. 1976

 

 

The student tax this year willjump
from eleven to thirteen dollars per
capita. if the proposed student
association budget is adopted. the
student board of finance announced
today.

The proposed budget calls for an
outlay of nearly 52,000 more than
that expended last ytiar. the board
declared.

The Dramatic and Art Association
demands an increase of $200. It was
last year granted an additional SISO
above the appropriation for the
preceding year.

Men‘s basketball has requested an
additional $200; men‘s baseball an
additional SISO; and Myskania re-
quests an additional $97 over its last
year‘s allowance.

Minor sports ask for an additional
5 mo. This will make the total outlay
for athletics $3,200. if demands are
approved in assemblies today.

Two new items. which will in-
crease the budgct nearly $l000. will
be presented. These are the State
Lion and membership in the
National Strident Federation
association.

Student Tax 13 Dollars .

October 5. I928

Requests of the Lion for support
from the student association were
granted in assemblies last Friday.
Emanuel Green. '30. who
represented State College at the
national college meeting in Lincoln.
Nebraska. last year was instrumental
in securing student support for this
project last spring.

The infirmary fund will ask for an
additional $200, which will bringthe
total to the amount granted two
years ago. Its appropriation was
decreased last year.

Nearly forty dollars additional
will be needed to pay for extras
printed in the freshman handbook
this year. It will need $432.26to meet
the expenses incurred by the editors.
The handbook last year was granted
$393.”.

Professor Clarence A. Hidley,
faculty treasurer of the student
board of finance. strongly
recommends to the student associa-
tion that the surplus of $807.04
remaining from last year should be
kept in reserve and not used to lower
the student tax.

Graft Rumor
November 22. I929

“The rumor to the effect that
members of the sophomore class
have misappropriated class funds is
absolutely without any foundation
whatsoever." Georpe P. Rice. presi-
dent of the class. declared today.

"During this week the rumor has
been circulating around the locker
rooms and corridors. If the actual
circumstances surrounding the ap-
proval of the appropriation wore
known. everyone could easily see
how groundless the rumor is." Rice
said.

The rumor began when an ap-
propriation of SIO was recently
granted for the expenses of the
sophomore football team. At the
time. no speciﬁc manner ofspending
the money was outlined. Members of
the class spent the money for
shoulder pads and other football
equipment. according to Kenneth E.
Mioler, sophomore manager of
men's athletics. _

Coach Rugherford R. Baker loan-
ed a ball to the men of both the
freshman and sophomore classes for
their football game. During one of
the practice sessions. the ball was
booted up into a.trcc and lost. Arlton
Bush. freshman manager of men's
athletics. purchased a new football.
costing $10.Aftcrthc home. this new
ball was given to Coach Baker to
replace the one which the men had
lost.

 

Student Tax 14 Dollars

October 4. [929

A fourteen dollar student tax. an
increase of one dollar over the
assessment last year, will be
presented in student assembly today.
according to an announcement of
the student board of ﬁnance. Larger
appropriations requested by several
student organizations will make the
increase necessary if the proposed
budget is accepted by the student
association.

At least $|.000 will have to be
deducted from the budget in order to
lower the tax one dollar, according
to the board. Even though a full
dollar is not required to meet in-
creased budget items. the tax will
have to be in even dollars. because
collection of change introduces too
great a chance for error. There have
been no errors so far in collection
of tax money, according to
Professor Clarence A. Hidley,
treasurer of the student board of
ﬁnance. because there was constant-
ly a check between the amount of
money collected and the number of
tickets sold.

If the budget is reduced less than
Sl.000. the tax can not be Sl3. It the
reserve fund were larger, enough
money could be deducted to make
up any deficit caused by a SI] tax,
but the inl'irmary fund drew on the
reserve money heavily last year. and
the student association voted up-
propriations several times to meet
