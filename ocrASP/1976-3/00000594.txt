Ladies and gentlemen. it has final-
ly pulled in. It look it long time. but
the jitterbug has at 'ast bitten the
most staid. the most conservative.
the most stiff-laced institution north
of the Mason-Dixon line. Yes sir,
swing' is on its way. not its
want . . . at State.

Back in ancient days when State
was young. and the Commons was
still pasture land. States minuettcd
to Strauss and the classics. Along
came the Charleston and the Black
Bottom. hot out of Harlem. the
greatest dance rages since C leopatrn
danced herself into Anthony‘s arms.
But State shrugged. frowned, and
waltzed on. The austerity ot'teaching

barred a savage abandon to the hot
jazz. Gradually the fox-trot
succeeded the waltz. and again the
dance sensations of the era. the shag
and shuffle. made no impression
upon State‘s dignified pedagogues.
Class after class swayed to the fox-
trot. I

Well. folksI this year has brought a
new freshman class with a new dance
psychology. New blood can certainly
achieve wonders and a wonder is be-
ing uchicvud at State. A bunch of
city-bred. Lindy-fed frosh have rous-
ed the lethargic upperclassmen. One
display ofthe Lindy aftcranothcr by
the jittcrbugging l'rosh has caught
the eye and fancy of thc envious up-

“Student Opinion Poll

December I5, I939

After hours of straining toil and
manipulation of figures in the realm
of higher calculus, the News
questionnaire has ﬁnally been com-
piled. This is to announce the results
of the poll of polls. the most super.
the most colossal, the most daring
questionnaire that has ever struck
this sleepy institution. Fellows here
is the lowdown on the fcmmcs.
Ladies. this is the dope on your men.

State. despite its reputation as be-
ing the toughest school south of the
North Pole. has the definite ap-
proval of both its male and female
population. As high as ninety-five
percent of the men and eiglity~two
percent of the women tliinktlic place
is fiin. Even the stooges are drawing
their usual satisfaction from their
books.

 

Turning to a more serious ques-
tion like dating. we find that twenty-
three women admit they will kiss on
the first date. Men, be more careful
in your dating! For if you are lucky,
you may date one of the twenty-three
who will osculatc on the first night.

But much more shocking is the
discovery that State men are almost
as unkissable as the women. Only

twenty-seven will permit their pretty ‘

lips to be kissed the first night. We
may conclude then that State is the
santuary of Platonic and intellectual
love.

If it is this type of love that exists
at State there must be plenty of it.
For the poll shows that one out of
three women and one out of every
four men are in this suhlimc condi-
tion.

Winter is usuallyun off-season for
love. lfas high a number as this are
amorous during an off-season, the
love rate must beterrific in spring. an
open-season.

In response to the question.
“Would you marrywhile in college?"
twonty percent ofthe women replied
they would. while but seven of the
men made the same answer. Further.
more. one out of every two women
admitted she \vould marry a State
man. From this we might conclude
that men come to college to date:
women come to marry.

Eighty percent ol the women can
cook. The women. then. not unit
will marry a State man Illll are
prepared to do so already. We
reiterate our wanting inert. \Htlcli
out. State girls are the marrying
kind.
