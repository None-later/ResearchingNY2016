“I?! ‘5'"?
‘ ‘ Describes Dream Girl

January 5, I940

Here-it is. Round tWo. Following
the old adage. “Turn about is fair
play." the men of State now give
their opinions of what the Ideal Girl
of State should possess. First on the
programis Max Sykes. '40: “She
must have a nice ﬁgure. be small
enough so that my arms can fit
around her, steer clear of jitter-
buggin‘ and have personality a la
carte. No premium on looks, must be
cooperative. and have the skin you
love to touch. She should give
attention to her escort and provide a
good incentive for leaving a warm
house. In short. an I890 lass with a
I940 model will do the trick.

Bob Agne. '4l. gives his viewpoint
which follows: uShe must not dance

. at all. be free ofjittercooties. and not

wear spiked heels. She must look
well in dark glasses but not wear
them: no painting fingernails and be
capable of fighting back."

Charles Quinn. ‘4l: “She must bea

' blond talkative. pleasingly plump

with a little oomph". personable dis-
position. and cooperative. She must
not be .jitterbuggiiih. or goody-
goody. She must be a good dancer
and ready for good. clean fun. I'd
like a girl with whom I can have a
good time. not a nice time."

Len Kowalsky. the editor-in-c~
feels that, “nature‘s preparation is

the most satisfactory. She must have
jitterability and no excess of avoir—
dupois because it will make her
perspire and that would tend to
dampen friendships. She should
have a highly adjusted neuro-
muscular system and an excellent
sense of humor although she does
not necessarily have to laugh at my
jokes. Her biggest meal should be
breakfast.“

(ACP) Hunting for a short-cut to

If you are. heed the following ine-
point program to scholastic
success—a program formulated for
you by the ever-helpful editors of the
Midland of Midland college:

I. Don't give your prof apples.
Too obvious.

2. Find out his hobby and follow
this up with well-planned questions
to draw him out.

3. If the entire class walks out of
the classroom when the prof is ID
minutes late. be the only oneto wait.
even if it‘s half an hour. This
procedure is good for a B<plus any
day.

4. Always greet an instructor.
never using his first name, but a

cheery “Good morning. professor."

5. When sitting at the facultytable
in the dining hall or walking about
the administration building. always
walk with your head down as if in
deep thought. pondering some
weighty problem in math or
philosophy. for instance. This is
highly recommended to get on the
honor roll.

6. Offer to wash the professor‘s
car. put up his storm windows or do
any little job around the house. but
don't accept any money for the
work.

Apple polishing procedure in
classrooms includes sitting in the
front row. responding to
professoritil humor with loud hearty
guffaws and liberal use of big words.

in from Hollywood for the movie

magnanimously refused and will

After today‘s publication the
results will be sent by carrier pigeon

cheer up the Finnish soldiers at the

the News does its noble part for
humanity. The questionnaire will be
sent to the Library of Congress so
that it may be preserved for
American posterity to behold and
marvel. (Ed. note—The writer ofthis
story is prone to exaggerate. The
janitor sent the whole pile of
questionnaires to the junk heap
yesterday.)

And now for the questionnaire—
Society decrees that ladies come
before gents. This column. being a
true gentleman. will conform and
take up the ladies‘ responses.

“Would you marry a State man?"
was the leading female question.
This question was to ﬁnd out
whether the women had their

matrimonial eyes out for State men.
Apparently they do not as a general
rule. As many as one-third of the
women firme replied they would not
enter connubial relations with State
