To commemorate the closed our sixtieth year of

publishing, we bring to you the first Albany Student Press “Greatest Hits” issue.

 

Everything you see was reprinted verbatim from old issues of the ASP, to give you

an idea of what the ASP has been as well as what students have concerned

 

i ” - ' ' themselves with over the years. From World War One to student taxes _ 

to the jitterbug to the perfect coed to the new campusto

Viet Nam and Nixon, this issue reflects sixty years 'of

 

students at Albany.
