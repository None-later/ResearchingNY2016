[ﬂoshIPlonning Conference I

September It], [964

by William Colgsn

“It sure is impressive. but it's gota
long way to go." said the frosh. as he
arid a group of his fellowrgot their
ﬁrst long look at the rapidly-rising
new campus that is the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany. '

The fresh and 1 I70 more like him

‘in the Class of '68 were the first

students at the University to be
oriented to their new environment
by the bold. precedent-breaking ex-
periment that was the Summer Plan-'
ning Conference. '
Held in’ten separate sessions over

the summer. groups of a hundred to

120 frosh were given an almost com-
pletely different induction to life at

'State than had been traditionally

given atiFrosh Weekends in the past.
Academic Emphasis

The Summer Planning Con-
ference differed in one key aspect

from the old methods of fresh orien-.
tation — its emphasis. and conse-
quently its methodsﬁwas placed

_upon a sober look at the problems

and the realities of getting a college
education. -
Academic advisement. orienta-
tion, and preparation was the order
of the day for the Yellow Jackets as
they went through two days of well-
coordinated activities, all calculated
to make them better students and.
better members of the University
community in September.
' The program presented differed
almost entirely from previous frosh
orientations. A reading test. ap-
pointments with academic advisors,
group discussions with student ad-
visors. meetings with the financial
and medical offices if needed. replac-
ed the trip to Thacher. the “Beanie
Ball." the impromptu skits. and
much. much more.

November I. I 968

by Don Stanksvsge

In-a special session last night. Cen-
tral Council accepted LAAC's
Proposed Changes in University
Residence Policies by a vote of 24-0-
2. The passage ofthis bill called for
abolition of Curfew Hours, discon-
tinuance ofthe Mandatory Sign-Out
procedure, determination of Open
House policy by the individual Hall
or Hall governments. and Closed
Doors.

At this time. freshmen women still
have curfew hours; next semester
they will face. if this policy does not
become effective, curfews at mid-
night. ‘

Even though the Mandatory Sign-
Out Policy would be abolished. an
optional system could be subscribed
to by any woman.

Determination of Open House
Policy by the individual Hall would
allow for a 24 hour open house poli-
cy. but Visitation Policy could

 

enclose any lesser time span.

The passage of this bill through
both Central Council and LAAC is
the culmination ofthe efforts of Cen-
tral Council and LAAC member Jay
Silverman. and LAAC‘s hard work-
ing Committee on Residence
Reforms. Their rationale for these
proposed Residence changes. which
appears as a special ASP supple-
ment. draws upon several sources
and most significantly from the Un-
iversity publication “Student

STUDENT TAX MANDATORY

October 29. [968
by Doris Steinhsrdt

The mandatory payment of Stu-~
dent Tax was passed in last week‘s
elections by a vote of 826 to 609.
Terry Mathias. Vice-President of
Student Association. naturally ex-
pressed pleasure at the outcome and
also at the number of students who
turned out to vote.

In the elections of May I. 2. and 3.
I968. 434 students went to the polls.
as compared with I444 who voted
this fall.

Mathias stated that the next step is
to finalize the procedures for collec-
tion of the tax. Planning that has
been going on for the past three
weeks is now nearing completion.

There will also be a small reduc-
tion in the price of the Strident Tax
Card. but Mathias hopes that thc
reduction can be made larger.

In the case of a strident in extreme
financial need. the student fee will
either be waived or rcduccd. The
final decision is tion in the hands of
the Financial Aids ()If'icc.

Two additional mcasurcs will in-
crease income to the Student
Association. Mcnthcrs of the faculty
cart purchase tax cards (on a voltm-
tary basis. of coursc). and the card
will he trnnsfcrruhle for lllL'

purchaser's entire family.

There will also be a married
students' tax card. If both spouses
are students at the University. they
will be entitled to a reduction in Stu-
dent Tax. If one spouse is a student
here and purchases a tax card, the
other spouse may also purchase one.
but at an increased rate.

Mathias also said. “I‘d like to
thank all the people who worked on
the election. all the election
assistants who worked at the polls.
and allthc students who came ottt to
vote.“ He also stated that the

number voting "shows that the
students are beginning to care about
their elections and indicates a change
in the feeling of the student body."

Also last week. the following
students were elected to seats on
Central Council: from State Quad.
Edward Weiss and Lynn Wilson;
from Dutch Quad. Douglas
(ioldschmidt and Nancy Mosher;
from Alumni Quad. (iregory Spear
and Kenneth Stokcm; and from
commuters. David Cummings and
Suzi Goldmachcr.

Nixon At Capital

Ur‘lober 29, / 968

by (iale McAllister

Republican candidate for the
Presidency. Richard M. Nixon.
spoke to a large crowd ol'supporlcrs
in front of the Capitol Building at
I223ll Monday on the tltctnc. “Let us
look at the record.“ a phrase coined
by the former governor of New York
State. Al Smith.

Nixon stated that all the Johnson
Administration has givctt the people
has been higher taxes. the highest
rntc of crime in history. and the
largest war the nation has ever been
in\ol\cd in.

I his. lic lccls. ls responsible l'orthc

largc credibility gap which exists
today. and for the lack of respect
that the public has exhibited for the
office of the President.

Nixon feels that the country cari-
not nllord four more years of
democratic rule with Vice President
HumphrcycontinuingonwithJolin-
son Administration policies.

In mentioning the Pueblo inci-
dent. Nixon made it clear that it is
time for a change. He charged that
present government cannot cope
with a “fourth rate nation." as North
Korea. and rclttrn American soldiers
to their country.

‘3 CURFEW, 0pm HOUSE BILLS pAssEo 

Guidelines."

Other sources include the Central
Council sanctioned LAAC Policy on
Responsibility. and Myskam‘a's
recommendation for abolition of
freshmen women's curfew.

On Wednesday of this week. 250
students assembled in Lecture Room
3 to view the weekly meeting of
LAAC where this bill passed 25-0-l.
At this same LAAC meeting. the
“Walden Experiment.“ a two week
proposal by Waterburyand Alden to
operate Open House by the defini-
tion “A door is open if it is not lock-
ed" was defeated.

The main reason voiced at the
LAAC meeting for the Walden
defeat was the underlying fear that
its passage might in some way inhibit

 

action in the faculty and ad-
ministrative circles on its "Proposed
changes" listed above. ‘

The current ' proposed policy,
changes were felt to be more com-
prchcnsivc and far more extensive
than the "Walden Experiment." A
majority of LAAC representatives
felt that the administration would
slow action on the more important
“Proposed Changes“ or. perhaps
even limit future changes to only the
changes proposed in "Walden Ex‘
periment.“

The basis for these residence
reforms is each student's personal
. responsibility. Personal responsibili-
ty will be the key to student conduct
behind a closed door so that one stu-
dent does not infringe upon the
rights of any other.
