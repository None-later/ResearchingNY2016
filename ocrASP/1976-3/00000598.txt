May 7, 7970

by Berry Klrsehner
Approximately 3.000

demonstrators marched on the

'Capitol Building in Albany. deman-

ding:

l) The release of Bobby Scale and
all political prisoners. ‘

2) The immediate withdrawal of
U.S. from the current Indo—Chinese
War.

_ 3) The end of university complici-
ty with the U.S. Department c
Defense. .

4) That FSA donate $25.000to the
Black Panther Defense Fund.

The march originated at the

‘ SUNYA uptown campus with fewer

than 2.000 persons and continually
picked up momentum and people as
it moved towards the Capitol.
Following a few brief speecnes in
front of the Capitol. the marchers.
still about 3.500 strong. sat in at
Broadway and State Street. at the
steps of the federal building.

The march disrupted traffic along
Washington Avenue; the State and
Broadway intersection was cfl'eeIIVc-
ly sealed for about one hour. The
march was orderly; the only injuries
known by this reporter occurring to
two students in the demonstration.
These were a result of being hit by
objects thrown by spectators along
the route. At least one of these in-
juries occurred near a construction
site downtown. Both students were
taken to Albany Medical Center and
later released.

Students from RPI and Siena also
participated in the rally at the
Capitol. In view ofthe exceptionally
cold weather. the turnout was ex-
pecially enormous in comparison
with past demonstrations. The mood
of the participants was serious.

Chants of “l-2-3-4. we don‘t want
your fucking war." and “5-67-8 we
don’t want your racist state“ in-
formed spcctators along the march
route what the participants stood
for. Leaflets were also passed out to
people in the area of thc demonstra-
tion.

At the Capitol brief speeches bya
member of the strike committee. a
representative of the Third World
Liberation Front and a leader of
Siena College's strike Were made. A
coffin with references to the kent
State killings and Illaek I’anther
trials was deposited at the steps of
the building. President Nixon was
hung and burned in effigy.

There were absolutely nocont‘ron-
tations between the marchers and
any police whatsoever. The
demonstrators came equipped with
first aid trucks ready for anything in-

eluding gun shot Wounds. and the
crowd had been instructed as to what
procerure should be followed if
chemical mace or tear gas flew.
However. no such developments oc-
curred.

In fact.thc absence of police was
conspicuous. This reporter saw no
city police along the entire march

route until a few blocks from the
Capitol. Those police that were in
the neighborhood were directing
traffic. When this reporter question-
ed a policeman concerning his feel-
ingabout the sit-in at Broadway and
State and how long it might go on. he
responded with words tothe effect of
“until their asses get cold. I guess."

Part of the credit for the orderly
fashion at the mar: Iv must go to the
marshalls who did .mexccllcntjob of
directing the marchers and traffic.
There were at least two minor in-
cidents between the demonstrators
and drivers of vehicles determined to
get through the crowd but nobody
was hurt.

Shortly after 7:00 pm. NBC
credits Nixon with Kentucky.
Tennessee. Indiana. Florida, and
Georgiajoin the Nixoneolumn soon
after. At 7:30 ABC totals show Nix-
on with a 35 point lead over
McGovern, 67-32. Nixon has nine
states and IIS electoral votes.

Minutes later. Alabama. South

Florida are listed for Nixon. A TV

A NBC election analyst suggests
that part ofNixon‘s victory is due to
an expensive, personal voter contact

All networks declared staggering

Midwest Nixon is acctunulating 6t)-
75 percent of the popular vote.
McGovern hopes for a victory in

Outside the Campus Center the
sky was a clear blue. brushed oc-
casionally by white. The sun glowed
down on a perfect day. a lazy, breezy
day. You could hear the fountain's
unceasing din above the sound of
people talking and a dog‘s bark. An
excited squeal broke out briefly from
one of the many groups seated and
standing idle on the podium and
around the fountain. It was noon
and many students were spending
their free moments between classes
enjoying the good weather. good
talk and good friendship and feeling
life that only a day such as yesterday
could bring.

In the Campus Center Ballroom.
on the second floor at the top ofthe
stairway going upfromthc mainlob—
by. there were still vacant seats. Only
a few people stood by the tnain
doors. not from necessity. but for
convenience. Findlay Cockrell

tion for those elcvcn Israelis who
“died on the field of peaceful com-
pctition." The Albany County Dis-
trict Attorney Arnold I’roskin rose
to speak about the eleven new mar-
tyrs and the six million old ones who
hopefully have made us all more
aware of the need for brotherhood
and peaceful relations among
nations. He felt we had enough mar-
tyrs and did not need any more.
“Martyrdom must cease." said
l‘roskin.

President Bent-rel spoke next.
condemning hatred and the feuding
among people and nations as being
"senseless" and "without resolve.“
He expressed hope and prayers for
the people of the world and stressed
the importance of the university in
working to end hatred by bringing
all people together. There was
silence in the ballroom.

The next speaker read a poem
written with the Olympic massacre
in mind. It was composed by
Reverend Harvey Bates of Universi-
ty Chapel House and entitled

“Munich and the Day of Atone-
ment.“ 'I he poem spoke ol the cruel.
hating and wicked ways of us human
beings. and of a hope that someday
we will rid ourselves of this hatred.
and atone for what has been done in
the past. Except for a few shedding
tears. it was quiet in the ballroom.

Leonard Weiss. an attorney from
the Albany Jewish Community
Council and Mayor Corning of
Albany also addressed the gathering
and condemned the dastardly
killings and senseless wars that
plague our world today. They too
hoped for peace and a time of
friendship and brotherhood for peo-
ple of all nations. There was silence
in the ballroom.

Then a psalm was read and a Kud-
dish by Rabbi Zimand and it was
quiet in the ballroom.

Outside one could hear the un-
ceasing din of the fountain above the
sounds of people talking and a dog's
bark. But there is no need to go on.
You cared. You were there. You
know how it felt.

National Strike Set Today

April 2/. I972
BULLETIN . . .

National Guardsmen moved on to
the University of Maryland campus
at 9:20 last night and began arresting
students who refused orders to dis-
perse and return to their dor-
tttltot‘lcs. There was no violence and
the guardsinen did not use tear gas to
disperse the crowds. A National
(itturd helicopter lit the area with a
flood-light as the arrests were made.
A spokesman for the campus radio
station was unable to give an cs-
tiinatc ol the exact number of
students arrested. but described the
number as “more than a van loud."
The spokesman indicated that more
arrests were likely as groups of
students refused orders to leave the
campus mall and obey a mandated
curfew. It was the fourth successive
night of demonstrations on the cam-
pus. “Guardsmen are still making
the rounds and ordering people to
get inside." the spokesman reported
as the ASI’ went to press late last

 

night.
by the Associated Press

National Guardsmen took control
of the University of Maryland cam-
pus ’l'hursday. after three con-
secutive nights of violent student
protest against the re newed bombing
of North Vietnam.

After one false start in which a
busload of guardsmcn had to be
recalled from the campus grounds.
(iov. Marvin Mandel declared a
state of emergency and ordered the
soldiers onto the campus in force.

“I'm fed up with this violence and
destruction of public and private
property. and I fully intend to see
that it ends." Mandel said earlier.
blaming “a Iiandlul" of the univer-
sity's 35.000 students for the dis-
orders.

'I'he campus had been reported
fairly quiet in the hours before the
guard took over. A noon antiwar ral-
ly failed to materialize. and students
strolled to and from classes in muggy
80-degree temperatures.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Under Mandel‘s emergency decree.
a 9 pm. curfew was imposed on the
campus proper rind adjacent areas.
The guard was ordered to limit
access to the campus to persons with
official business. thus providing for
the arrest and detention of anyone
not having a legitimate reason for
being there.

In New York City. antiwar ac-
tivists defied a court order and
blocked entrance to eight buildings
on the Coltunbia University campus.
Four other classroom buildings
remained open.

Antioch College students took
part in an attempt to block two ofthe
five gates into Wright-Patterson Air
Force llasc at Falrborn. Ohio. More
than I25 demonstrators were
arrested.

The protest delayed many workers
en route to theirjobs at the air base.
‘I‘raft'ic was divorted to three un-
impeded gates. Estimates of the
number of demonstrators ran as
high as 500.
