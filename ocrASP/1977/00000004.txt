Council when its‘ executive staff was
forced to keep pleading for patience.

Current Station Manager Eric
Goldstein took out a file perhaps a
half foot thick and began going
through documents that attested to
WSUA'e eight year attempt to
achieve Its license.

Littleton Smith, WSUA's station
manapr in i969-70, had taken the
original steps in seeking froni the
University to accept an FM station
on this campus. Smith was so confi-
dent of the process beingashort one.
that lie issued a memo in Sept. of
I970 assuring station members that
WSUA would be an FM station by
that Christmas. in addition, Central

station receiving its license in the
very near future.

Of course that never happened.
The station's executives soonreali‘z;

procedures necessary to; obtain an:

FM license were far more complex
than any of them had ever an-

same old story and the same old ex-
cuse. “It‘s just around the corner."
With the license obviously going

A professional consultant. Ed
Perry. was hired and Associate Dean
of Student Affairs Robert
Squatrigiia offered to Work closely
with the Station's executive staff in
the hopes of ﬁnally realizing what
had become a dream.

With the help of these two men.
the former working on the technical
aspects of the license. and the latter
involved in the administrative and
guidance function. the FM applica-
tion began to move again.

Goldstein summed up the good
news by saying that even though
much work remains to be done. we

Student Association plans to
charter buses of a reduced rate for
students to‘ the New York
metropolitan area after a dispute
with the American Enterprise Com-
pany forced cancellation of a similar
chartered buses prior totbe interses-

sion break, according to SA 'Vice '

President Gary Parker. _

“According to the Board ‘ of
Trustees guidelines." said Parker.
“No private commercial enterprise is
allowed to use University property
for private profit." .

The American Enterprise Co..
headed by senior Rich Lipson. had
been chartering buses for students at
vacation time for over three ycars.
Bus transportation was offered to
students at a reduced rate to various
points in Westchcstcr. New York
City and Long Island.

According to Lipson. tltc com-
pany made about $500 at each vaca-
tion.

“1 was aware Lipson was running
the buses last September.“ said
Parker. “I wasn't aware ofthc Board
of Trustees guidelines until someone
in our research department showed
them to me after September."

; Parker. according to Lipson. first
opposed the chartered buses rttn by
the company before the Thanksgiv-
ing break.

'"tte ._ denied. application

said Lipson. “but allowed us to run
buses in.a. joint venture With Delta
Sigma [the business fraternity]." . n

The. fraternity is a non-profit
organization and therefore is not
subject to the Trustees? guidelines for
money-making Operationsxon cam-
pus.

"As far as I know. “ said Parker.
“Lipson was hired by Delta Sigma to
work for them in this instance. They
paid his as an individual."

The fraternity was not involved in
the chartering of intersession buses.

“i realized that Delta Sigma
wasn’t going to run the buses." said
Lipson. ' ‘

Lipson then proceeded to charter
the buses himself and advertise with
the familiar posters boasting savings
in transportation costs.

Although the advertising posters
were put up at the beginning ofthc
week. Lipson did not formally bring
the solicitations application until
Dec. 7. the day before tickets wcrcto
go on sale.

“I thought that if Gary [Parker]
realized no bttscs were running and I
brought a solicitations application
to him at the last minute. he might
sign it.“ said Lipson.

“'Lipson called me at the last
minute." said I’ttrkcr. “I told him

Lipson said that Parker told him
that if he had started to sell tickets in.

would have had called security. and
have him arrested.

Lipson claimed that when he
questioned Parker about in-

conveniencing students who bad‘

responded by saying “Irrelevant.
totally irrelevent."

Parker said that the inconvenience

was one of his major concerns. but'

claimed that nothing could be done
about it at that time. As far as SA
taking over the charter at the last
minute. Parker said. “It wouldn‘t
have been feasible. We didn‘t have
the manpower or the sufficient
notice to run it.“

According to Lipson. over 150
students were aifcctcd by the
cancellation.

“It is truly unfortunate that Gary
did not see fit to cxccrcisc discretion
in order to benefit the student body."
said Central Council Chairman Greg
