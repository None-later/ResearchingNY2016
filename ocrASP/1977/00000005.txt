Antique Glider Destroyed in Fire

HARRIS HILL. N.Y. (AP) One of
the ﬁrst gliders ever built in the Un-
ited States was destroyed in a ﬁre
here in the administration building
at the Harris Hill Glider Field.

The glider was build in the 1890's
by Matthias C. Arnot. whojumped
off cliffs and ﬂew through the air
hanging onto the frame of the con-
traption, which cortsisted mostly of

wings.

The glider was owned by the
National Soaring Museum in nearby
Elmira. it was displayed in the ad-
ministration building, which was
also destroyed in the ﬁre. The ﬁre oc-
curred at about 6:30 am.

Electrical Breakdown

Authorities. believed the ﬁre may

have been linked to a breakdown in

the building's electrical system.

Director of the museum, William
English, said he could not estimate
the value of the plane.

No Value Possible

“Trying to place any monetary
value on the plane is like trying to
place a figure on Charles
Lindbergh's plane or the Wright
Brothers‘ plane. Youjust can't do it ”

of the Senate and before the Con-
ferencc of Continuing Education.
Manpower Policy and Lifelong
Learning in Leesburg, Virginia,
Javits said youth unemployment
“has reached crisis proportions." He
added “it is time we beganto relieve
some of the disproportionate burden
of joblessness borne by young

.  .Legialative Action

Americans."

The Javits—Humphrcy bill would
establish four programs to
ameliorate the youth unemployan
program:

most l'rigid weather. and business in
lung-johns is booming even where
chilly legs are rare.

“Everybody‘s got a coat or a
jacket." said Tom Lathnm. a
merchandise manager for .I.(‘.
I’enttcy itt Columbia, SC. “llut long
underwear's a basic item that a lot of
people don‘t have. Our long un-
(lchL'iif sales are up 35 to 40 percent
over last year."

Longiohns Brisk

“To say the least, sales in long-
jOhns have been brisk,“ said Dick
Nokcs. Scars' merchandise manager
in Durham N.C. “People are stan-
ding in line l'orthcm. Sometimes I
think i'm the East Coast dis-
tributor."

Folks living in the warmer clinics

“I wouldn‘t know wlterctostttrt to
tell you about all the stuff We sold."
said the manager oi'a discount store
in Marietta. Oitio. “W."vc sold a

the air bag will cost consumers SIOO
for driver and passenger front 4seat

protection and $50 for driver—

side—only protection, unless in-
dependent studies indicate a higher
price should be charged.

Coleman said General Motors has
agreed to build 300,000
intermediate—sized cars with air
bags for the driver and front—seat
passenger for sale in model years
1980 and ESL-Ford Motor Co. will
manufacture at least 140.000 com-
pact cars with driver—side only air
bags in the same model years.

Mercedes-Benz has agreed to
ship to the United States 750 sedans
with driver—only air bags for sale in
model year I980. and an additional
|.500 sedans with driver air bags in
