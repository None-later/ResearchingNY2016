is rich in the kind of profound, multilevel per-
formances that movies rarely have time to
develop. intimate yet majestic in a way that is
special to ﬁlm. - .
The‘storrn center of the play is Hickey. the
hardware drummemnd reformed sinner who
returns to his old friends at the bar selling a
new product—inner peace. He annihilates the
pipedrearns in which the patrons of Harry
Hope‘s (Fredric March) New York flophouse
bar use as their crutch; conﬁdent that.
liberated from their illusions, they will live at
peace with themselves. Everyone in Harry‘s
place needs booze to nourish his dream, but it
is the dream itself. not alcohol, that keeps
them alive. Hickey. underneath his salesman‘s
brass and chatter needs rage. contempt and
anguish to galvanize the entire play.
Hickey is played well by Lee Marvin. He
brings-the fanatical fever of the convert and
the winning bravado of the salesman to the
role of Hickey. However, it is Robert Ryan‘s
