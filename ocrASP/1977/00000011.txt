qui s ten years service for

retirement hating.

 

This problem. or one similar. is being faced .
or will be faced by many of the working public 1
in our state and nation. Should'big business , V

and the government have the right to handicap
the wrtomlcmployngnt K mobility of its
working people by using the loss of the securi-
ty of retirement  as the penance for
freedom? _

With social security now on the verge of
bankruptcy. it would seem that additional
public funds could be brought to its advantage
by offering the principle of IRA (individual
retirement account) to the hands of the down-
trodden social security system. The complexi-
ty of state and federal ﬁscal union for the
betterment of the public is beyond my un-
derstanding. but is at this time a question that
must be answered by the nation‘s politicians
who call themselves public servants.

| most humbly request aid and information
in search for the answer to this perplexing
problem faced not only by this writer. but by
the thousands of unemployed people now and
in the future of this blessed nation.

asp reigns supreme

To the Edltor:

Through my college paper 1 receive copies
of the Albany Student Press and 1 read almost
every one thoroughly. 1 wish to express my
[5spcct for its staff.

Although I have always felt that the paper
was a fincexamplc ofqualityjourndlism, 1 was
ﬁnally inspired to write a letter when 1 came
across an article entitled, "A Look at
Beethoven,“ by Stephen Almasi. in thc
Dcccmbcr 10 issue of the ASP. Since lam 3
Beethoven fanatic. the timeliness of the article
really hit home (the loth being the composer's
birthday). As 1 said. quality articles are not un-
common in the ASP. I constantly find the
Pllpcr giving thorough coverage of what scam
to be the most relevant events and issucs on
your campus. and the coverage is handled in
an objective manner — often a rarity in
college journalism.

1 must also compliment the layout stuff of
the paper. College papers are often so sloppy
that they appear nothing more than aesthetic
culustrophcs. The ASI’ is not only intcrcsting
to read, but it is plcitsing to thumb through.

 - moat you for adding to the credibility of 
-- college Journalism. 1 hope you continue to do

as fine a job as you have been doing; ' ,

rac'quette rescued

To the Editor:

Thank you for your support concerning the
Racquettc in your December 7th issue ofthc
AS P. The Racquctte has succeeded in nullify-
ing the “free press” resolution which was puss-
cd by the student senate here at SUNY at
Potsdam.

Willi a bit of lobbying. we managed to gain
enough support to overturn the resolution. it
resolution which would have surely led to a
vast degradation of the quality. and freedom.
of this newspaper.

The scnute resolution, which was passed
hastily and without much thought. only
succeeded in straining the already poor
relations between the senate and the Rac-
qucttc. With problems like the mandatory fee
referendum. due to come before the students
next semester, and a $40,000 deficit in the
SGA treasury. the senate and the media
should work together rather than apart from
one another.

give me A’s

Dear Professors,

It has come to my attention that due to the
lack ofspucc. there is an attempt to “weed out"
the number of students entering the School of
Business. Therefore. 1 would like to make a
deal. 1 promise that if you all give me A‘s this
semester. I will transfer at the start ofthc Fall
1977 academic year. Your objectives will be
satisl led in that you will have one less prospec-
the business miijor to Worry about, and my
objectives will also be satisfied in that my
transferring will help me rcluin what little
stinin I have left ultcrspcndingtwo years here.
You‘ll bi: happy. and God knows. I‘ll be hap-
py. In View ofthc facts, 1 would be most willing
to sign it contract binding me to my request.

The executive staff of WSUA has deemed the go-ahead for
construction of an FM radio station from the Federal Communications
Commission, a feat deserving commendation and a brief Halleluja
chorus. After years of internal mismanagement, dealings with a
cumbersome external bureaucracy and animosity provided courtesy of
certain student government ofﬁcials past, it appears that WSUA-AM,
longtime bastardization of a'campus radio station, will ﬁnally disappear
to make room for a high quality FM stereo station at SUNYA. '

There was a day when only a person hard of hearing could tolerate,
much more than a few minutes in a roOm with WSUA tuned in.
Technically, the sound was poor, thanks to a seemingly incurable buzz
in the carrier current broadcast system. Presentation-wise, the sound
was abominable: fragmented and inconsistent programming, infantile
disc jockeys and, often, no disc jockeys at all. Some said the station
lacked character; that it had no real sound. Actually, it would have been
better off that way. -

In short, WSUA, along with its annual FM fertility rites was heading
towards the drain for a quick ride to the sewer. But recent history has
witnessed the inﬂux of competent people at WSUA and a resultant
increase in quality. -

While WSUA’s on~air performance became more coherent, more
enjoyable to listen to, the technical buzz remained. And the monaural
sound was and still is sufﬁcient cause to turn most serious listeners away.

Though the staff of WSUA is seemingly on the verge of bringing an
FM station to SUNYA, some key complications still must be overcome.
First there is the space problem. WSUA ofﬁcials contend they will need
more space than they presently have for an FM installation. Doubtless,
the administration and SA must ﬁnd them the space they need —— but not
at the expense of other groups. An economical and equitable solution to
the problem must be reached. Perhaps the answer is to move some of the
sparsely-populated administrative offices in the Campus Center into
WSUA‘s present headquarters, thereby opening up some of the more
roomy ofﬁces for the radio station's space-consuming FM studios.

Another problem facing WSUA executives is money, or rather, the
lack of it. Student Association has shown the will to cooperate and
provide adequate funds for FM construction. Hopefully, they will not

 

change their minds now.
