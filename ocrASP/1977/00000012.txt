g‘cwuw AND PARTLY suns?“

 
 

   

by David Tree-r

An older gentleman once told me that the
longer we progress down the road of time the
more complex will become our problems and
the more complex the solutions. I somehow
got an understanding of this statement as I
watched Jimmy Carter present his cabinet ap-
pointees one after the other. Each came to the

lectern articulating the responsibilities and .
concerns of each respective department. I

wondered how a federal government such as
ours could integrate effective. progressive
policies when the headaches of just one
department offered enough problems to keep
the government fully occupied for the next
four years. It is the image of one step forward,
two steps back. One department's solution
may mean another department's problem.
May even Jimmy Carter, the epitome of
managerial efficiency. find it impossible to
make any headway in this sea ofcomplcxity?

A predecessor of Mr. Carter's had a novel
solution to our complex problems; at
a reasonably low cost to the taxpayer. The
President was Richard Nixon and the solution
was something which I call “facade politics";
this is basically the appearance of doing
something while really doing nothing at all. It
was a l984-ish type approach. All that
mattered was keeping the people happy. They
couldn‘t possibly know what was really going
on, nor whether or not anything was being
done at all. It was a cheap solution because it
only required one‘s imagination. One imagin-
ed that things were being done while they real-
ly weren't. This saved tens of billions ofdollars
over even Mr. Carter's planned cutbacks and
rcorganizations.

If President Carter goes but part way in the

 

 
    

fulfillment of his objectives hewillstillbeeonsi
ahead of his predecessor. Mr. Nixon. Nixon
took the low political road. deceiving us as to
his actions on our behalf. while simultaneous-
ly dragging down our opinions of ourselves as
Americans.

Mr. Caner seems to be aiming for a higher
road; aiming for a politics of substance not
facade, which. if his actions are consistent.
may very well yield some uplifting of our
national self-image lost during the Nixon
years. We could say that we have gained once
again some measure of faith in ourselves. This
is not from a spiritual perspective. for it is
nothing more than a trust in one‘s own
abilities which go beyond rational hounds.
And one only knows that that ingredient I call
"faith" is necessary ifwe are to have some hope
of surmounting the monumental problems
which face both us and the incoming ad-
ministration . The reason for this is that ifyou
look too long and too hard at the bare facts of
a problem a feeling of hopelessness and
despair sets in; a rigor mortis which ultimately
yields no movement at all.

Jimmy Carter has faith in himself: the
source from which he derives his hope and op-
timism to solve the problems of the United
States. Of course. who‘s to say that faith in
oneself isn't actually arrogance and egotism‘.’
Wasn‘t this so in the case of Richard Nixon?
Mr. Carter may take a higher political road
than his predecessor, but one should be very
leery of closing the scrutinizingeyes that Mr.
Carter ﬁnds himself under. lf we‘ve learned
anything in the last eight years it‘s that we need
to continually probe and investigate to make
certain we are gettingsubstance. not facade. in
the pursuit of solving complex problems.
