db," according to Austin. He" scored
_‘ten points and pulled down ﬁve
rebounds.

 

' I Lynn Pinkston. the Pups' offen- .

sive playmaker. ran a well-organized
offense. Though the Pups went to
the right side of the court most of the
night. they were very patient.‘The
crowd started getting restless at
times as it seemed as if Pinkston and
Darrell Grant were 'playing catch'
while looking for the open man.

The ﬁrst halfended with the Pups
missing three consecutive shots.
However. they managed to go into

v the locker room holdinga one point
edge. 28-27.

Secondhalf action seemed like an
instant reply of the first half. The
Pups and H.V.C.C. were shooting

‘ poorly and play was slow. But then
Al Williams came off the Pups‘
bench and turned things around.

With about three minutes remain-
ing in the game. the Pups led by six‘
points. Suddenly. shots began to go
in. on both sides. as the clock ticked
away.

H.V.C.C. cut theedgeto four with
just 33 seconds remaining. The full
court press employed by H.V.C.C.
was effective. and the Pups‘ ten
seconds to cross midcourt were
dwindling quickly.

In a llash. .lerry Januszewski
whipped a half-court pass to
Williams. who dunked the ball with
twenty-six seconds left. and the
game was scaled. At the hit/Yer.
Pinkston popped a jumper. to make
the final score 67-59. in favor of the
Pups. ‘

After the game Coach Austin ex-
plained that he was missing. two
starters. Patti Franz dislocated tt
vertebrae. and Keith Williams did
not return to Albany this term.

Austin cited Craig Fields for “a
good contribution. Though he did
not score many points. hc’playcd
good defense and helped move the
ball around on offense." Austin said.

Swimmers Shine
In Sunny Florida

by Andy Firestone

Over the recent vacation. the
Albany State swimming team
travelled to Florida Ior a twelvoday
period of trainihg and competition.
It was relerred to as a "rewarding.
refreshing type oi trip" by Coach
Ron White.

The tenth spent three daysrhc first
week in intense practice. 'I hey swam
[2,000 yards in each of the three 5-
hour exercises. The ten hours spent
the second week brought the total of
miles swam to 45 for the entire trip.

Although the late recess caused
the Danes to miss entering the East-
West meet. they did place three
swimmers in the Ualt Ocean Mile
event. Dave Rubin beat out l22
other swimmers to place 28th. in-
cluding brother Mitch Rubin (66th)
and teammate Mark Jaffe (lJlst).

The following week. Coach White
divided his squad into two teams for
the "First Annual Albany Ocean
Mile Swim". The event. scored like a
crossvcountry run. featured a sibling
rivalry as the team featuring captain
Dave Rubin tied the team led by
Mitch Rubin 39-39.

Coach White used the work “Iop~
notch" on more than one occasionto
describe the Florida experience.
“The team came back in lop-notch
condition. They're highly motivated
and ready to hit some personal high
times.

“They have a real good spirit. The
trip really brought them together.
They saw some top~noteh coaches
and swimmers from around the
country. as well as the Hall of Fame.
and it really helped.”
