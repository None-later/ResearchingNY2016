by Andy Firestone .

The Great Danes of Albany swam
two of the biggest meets of the
season in the past month. winning
one and losing tbs other in the last
leg of the final event.

Back on December ll. Albany
faced SUNYAC power Plattsburgh
in a crucial early-season mulch-up.
The Danes were victorious that day,
as they handed the Cardinals a 59-50
defeat. The meet was close all the
way with many good early season
times and near-record performances
turned in.

The deciding events of the meet
were the ZOO-yd. breaststroke and
the l-meter diving. Albany pulled
out the top two spots in the
breaststroke as Jeff Cohen (230.4)
was followrd by Dan Dudley
(2:345). Dudley sat out last season
and is the school record holder in the
Wyd. freestyle. Artie Rosenberg
locked up the Dane victory with a l-

vmetor diving gold medal perfor-

ed second in the 50-yd. freestyle with

winners.

' ; CDTA: Hollows J

by Jennifer Wolff
and Jonatlnn Hodges I

A proposal was made last week by _
the Capital District Transportation
Authority to take over the present
SUNYA bus service.
‘ The proposal. which is the
culmination of meetings between
CDTA staff and SUNYA communi-
ty members. would cost SUNYA
5325.000 to implement. if the
proposal is accepted, CDTA would
then become eligiblefor another
$325,000 in Federal matchingfunds.

Under the CDTA plan. not only
would present service along
Washington and WeStérn Avenues
be provided. but free bus service
would also be available anywhere

university community members. The
base fare area is that district withing
5.5 miles'of the Wellington Hotel.

According to SA President Steve
DiMeo.Jone reason for CDTA's

 

 

 

i_:

desire to provide city-wide service is
toestablish “sole source“‘status. This
means that if SUNYA enters into an
agreement with CDTA for this ser-
vice. only another company that
could providc equal Service could
bid for the contract. Since CDTA is

_the only company in the area able to

provide this service. there would not
be any other bids.

“1 think there are still a lot of
doubt in the minds of members of
the SUNYA Bus Committee about
the accountability [of CDTA]. and
the autonomy that wc will be giving
up to this service. Once we give up
the [SUNYA] buses we‘ll never get
them back again. Are we locking
ourselves into a contractual agree-
ment that we will later regret?“

- Fields Clarifies Public Policy

by Spence Ragglo
The latest version of the Mission
Statement. released by . President
Emmett Fields on Jan. 7. is'revised
to the extentAthat it

on the meaning of
Analysis public policy analysis.

Yet proposals set down in the
original document remain essential~
ly unchanged.

A major complaint among
respondents to Fields‘ original docu-
ment. The Proposed Statement of
Mission. was a general ambiguity in
the central proposal —— public policy
analysis. A great many cuts lind
reallocations were made in the name
of policy analysis. but there was corr-
l'usion as to how this differed from
public service. if at all. and why
SUNYA was being pointed ih this
direction.

Public policy analysis. as defined

in the Mission Statement. is just one
aspect of public service provided by
the university. From the statement:

The State of New Yorlt is current-
ly faced with a variety of policy

Fields Spells Out Carey’s Budget Cuts

 

by Paul Rosenthal

President Emmett Fields began to
further explain the implications of
Governor Hugh Carey‘s Executive
lludgel yesterday at a meeting of the
University Senate. While
acknowledging that there tnuy be
some hardship at SUNYA caused by
the recommended slush of $539,000.
Fields said the proposal was “not as
severe as last year."

63 Eliminations

Carey's budget proposal calls for
savings of over half ll million dollars
through the elimination of 63
positions at SUNYA. Six new
positions would be added for the
Center for Governmental Research
and Services and the State Manage-
ment institute.

0f the stuff reductions. live would
come from faculty. with an ad-
tlitlonnl eight from faculty support
positions. including technical and

“Not As Severe As Last Year”

clerical personnel. Academic sup-
port units such ns the University
Library and the Educational Corn-
municntions Center would be harder
hit. with losses of 26stnff positions.

According to Fields. many of the
personnel reductions have been ex-
peeled. with some of those positions
nlrendy vncntcd.

Buffalo Gains

Fields noted that the three other
SUNY university centers were sub-
ject to similar proposed cuts. with
only lluffalo showing a gain, due to
the construction ofthe new Amherst
campus. Binghnmton‘s recommend-
ed cutback was set at $51 l.000. while
Stony Brook faces a 8599.000 budget
rcducatlon.

“We understand the economic and
fiscal realities which underlie the
shape of the Executive Budget ." said
Fields. but expressed concern about
“the effect the proposed reductions

will have on our capabiliin to
educate and serve.“

Fields pointed out that the Divi-
sion of the Budget “understands our
priorities and [is] eager to follow our
priorities."

The budget calls for the experi-
diture of “05.000 for two public
policy oriented units to be developed
at SUNYA. These programs are a
result of what the budget summary
culls “comprehensive program re“
evaluation." which has taken place
at SUNYA. largely at Ficlds' urging.

Feb. Deadlines

Responses to and suggestions
about the Executive Budget are due.
according to Fields. by Feb. 2|.
Most campus reaction at SUNYA
will be chaneiled through the Utt-

iVersity Senate and then sent to

Fields by Feb. l4.
During the following months.
state legislators are expected to

review and revise parts of Carey‘s
proposed budget. It is feared by
some that proposed reductions in aid
to the state‘s public schools and in
social services might tempt some
lawmakers to suggest further cuts in
the SUNY budget.

Fields warned that SUNYA
should watch carefully “even for ad-
ditional reductions.“ He said. “We
must be vigilant throughout the
legislative session."

Fields noted that past week
brought three major losses to
SUNY. in addition to the

recommended budget slashes. the
State Supreme Court upheld the
Education Commissioner's right to
deregister SUNY programs. such as
the English and History doctoral
programs at SUNYA. and the leav-

sion. Fields said in the statement.
must be the public and not‘just the
government -— "an independent and
non-partisan view ofthe issues must
be maintained.“ But the university
must also benefit; a certain amount
of distance must be maintained from
the governmert_t_l according to
respondents to the Mission.

The document begins by outlining
the concept ofa university. which is
broken down into three basic func-
tions: “the discovery. application
and transmittal of knowledge."
These functions may be roughly
translated into teaching. research
and consultation. and all are enclos-
ed undcr the umbrella of “public ser-
vice." in this sense. the Mission sees
the university as a public service in-
stitution. performing a service to
society by turning out educated
students and by providing a suitable
environment for research.

The Mission Statement also ad-i
dresses the concept of quality — not
just for the sake of an excellent
educational institution. but for the
national stature accompanying ex-
cellence. Resource reallocation is
proposed to be based upon three
criteria: need. the ability to con-
tribute to the policy analysis aspect
of the mission.andthe abilityto gain
or sustain national prominence
