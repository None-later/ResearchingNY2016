CINCINNATI (AP) As Capt. W.A.
Boudreaux boiled his way'up the
Ohio River. tryingto get I2 barges of
oil products to Pittsburgh. he was
concentrating on the ice blocking his
way. He wasn't expecting problems
with pedestrians.

But when his towboat. the City of

barges were the first to go upriver
past Cincinnati since last Monday.

Boudreaux said he was delivering
fuel and lubricants to Pittsburgh
from Cairo. Ill.

He was followed by another tow
carrying empty propane barges.
Both were “i: ailing“ their way
through the ice.

After coming to a halt. the captain
called Cincinnati and Covington
police through the marine operator.

JANUARY 25. 1977

by Jonathan Hodges

It’s I2 o'clock on a Thursday
night. You and your friend have just
decided you couldmake afarrune by
selling “Fields' Yummy Toffee” in
the Campus Center and you can't go
to sleep until yauﬁnd out if fl '5 legal:
You look up the name of SA Presl-
denl Steve DiMco only to ﬁnd that a
number isn‘t listed.

You've just smashed up the SA
van. Knowing that SA Vice Presi-
dent Gary Parker has a deep concern

Aid Applications
to be Available

Financial Aid applications for ‘77-
‘78 will be available starting this
Thursday. according to Financial
Aids Director Donald Whitlock.

The new forms can be picked up in
either the Financial Aids office or in
room no of Business Administra—
tion. Also available at this time will
be the new Basic Education Oppor-
tunity Grant (BEOG) forms.

Additionally. all Educational 0p-
portunity Program (EOI’) students
are urged to contact their EOI’
counselor for their new EOI’ forms.

for the vehicle, you race to grab a
SUN YA directory. You get hls
number. An operator informs you
that the number has been dis-
connected.

‘ The idea of easy accessibility of
elected student representatives was
voiced as a prime concern in recent
interviews with SA President Steve
DiMco and SA Vice President Gary
Parker. both of whom can not be
contacted by using the newly releas-
ed ‘76—‘77 University Directory.

"I guess I just didn't get my form in
on time.“ explained DiMeo. who,
along with all off-campus students.
must fill out a form every Sept. in
order for their phone number to
appear in the directory.

“I handed my form in on time."
said Parker. “Either I made a mis-
take, or who ever typed my form
made a mistake. l'm listed correctly
in the new Albany city directory."

"I don't mind students calling
me." said DiMeo. “as long as I don‘t
get any obscene phone calls after
midnight. DiMco said that his home
phone number is 482-0253.

Parker. whose number is off by
one digit. can be reached by calling
434-8573. According to Parker. he
“welcomes hearing front his cott-

stituents." ' _

Both Student Association ex-
ecutives felt that it was wrong for
elected student representatives not
to be available to those whom they
represent. When told that many of
the off-campus members of Central
Council had unlisted numbers.
Parker responded.

"I think it‘s wrong." said Parker.
“What are we here for in the first
place? We are here to serve the pop-
ulus of this community. lfthey can't
reach us. what good are we tothem‘!

0f the twelve off-campus
members of Central Council. five
were not listed. and one had the
wrong telephone number. For those
of you who do wish to contact your
representatives, here is a list of the
unlisted.

438-4346. At this number not only
can you contact GaryKlein and Bob
Garelick. who are both listed. but it
will also connect you with unlisted
Central Council members Larry
Bray and Mark Berczow.

Bruce Klein can be reached at 465-
2802. Arthur Redford at 465-9683.
while one must ignore Howard
Struker‘s listed number of 463-3995
and instead truck him down at 465-
9683.
