(AP) Fido can diet right along with
the other members of-the family
these days. ~ I- » r

Pet food manufacturers have in-
troduced products desigried‘to help
overweight animals slim down and
stay healthy. You could. of course,
simply feed an overweight dog less.
Like the diet foods for humans. the
pet products are designed to over-
come a lack of willpower. "

The ﬁrst entry in the market—
General Foods‘ “Cycle” brand—isn‘t
billed as a diet food. Instead. it con-
centrates on what are called the
different life cycles of a dig and
stresses that animals of differ: :nt ages
often have different' nu’ritional
needs.

A growing puppy. for example.
needs twice as much protein as an
adult dog. One variety of “Cycle”
was aimed at inactive. adult animals.

 
   
  
  

Cycle is a canned 'dog, food.  '
Advertising Age. the trade publica- "

tion. reported in September that
General Foods also Was testing a dry
variety of the same product.
Meanwhile. Ralston Purina Co.
announced‘plans for its owh dict
foot-—“Fit & Trim"- a dry variety
advertised as “lower in calories.
lower in fat." , '
Purina statistics quoted by Adver-
tising Age show that‘72 per cent of
dog-owning households have

animals three' years and older; 4i ‘

percent say their dogs are
overweight; and 62 percent say they
have inactive dogs who pt little ex-
ercise.
Americans spend almost $2 billion
a year on dog food. and that doesn't
count the value of table scraps.
V A survey by the Pet Food Institute
shows that in I974, the industry used

 
    

trims lyj2.2 pounds’ofby-
H s ‘from; meat. poultry and
seafood and 2.5 billion pounds of 'g
feed grains and grain lay-products.

Dry dog food. which is generally

the cheapest._is the biggest seller——
S86l million worth in l975—and has

increased its share of the markel'as ‘

consumers tried to out food budgets.
Canned dog food accounted for

' about $642 million in 'sales in I975.

moist dog food was worth $290
billion and biscuits accounted for
$82.5 million.

Veterinarians and other pet ex-
perts say deciding which type of
product to feed your dog—dry.
moist, or canned—is a metter of

, human preference and the animal's

taste. There is no nutritional
difference.

Cornell University‘s Consumer
Education Program even has some

  

c _ -
Dogs can now go on diets with their masters thanks to new pet food- . '

advice on how to make dry food
appealing to dogs who are used to
the canned variety.

“Mix the two together." the un-
iversity suggests. “Gradually use

more of the dry product and less of
the canned until the dry food is fully
accepted. The crunchy texture of dry
food appeals to many dogs. And the
dry type is easy to digest and helps
clean the dog‘s teeth." v

The university also says that it is
not necessary to give dogs mineral
and vitamin supplements if you
choose a food than already provides
the required amount of nutrients.

“Look for the words. ‘complete
and bnlnnced diei‘ on package
labels." the university sltys. “In most
crises. this claim is based on
recommended nutritional of t Ic
National Academy of Science»
National Research Council."
