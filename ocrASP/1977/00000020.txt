Peer" Piessure’ Causes Dolinquency

WASHINGTON (AP) A teen-ppr‘s '
friends have more influence than his
parents in determining whether he
will b’éconte involved in serious
juvenile delinquency. researchers
saidjn report.‘

But parents will exert a stronger
inﬂuence in determining the child's
involvement in less serious forms of
delinquency. such as truancy from
school and running away from
home. the researchers suggested.

The ﬁndings were developed by
the Institute for Juvenile Research.a
branch ofthe Illinois Department of
Mental Health. The Institute is in the
last year ofa six-year project ﬁnanc-
ed with SL9 million from the Law
Enforcement Assistance Ad-
ministration.

LEAA issued a preliminary report
and promised a more complete
analysis in September.

During the project. researchers
questioned 3.180 youths between I4
and [8 years ofage and l.9700ftheir
parents. Those interviewed were in
30 Illinois counties.

The researchers concluded that
“peer group pressure is the single
most important factor in dictating
the presence or absence of juvenile
delinquent behavior.” leaa said.

“Most of the assumed inﬂuences
on creating delinquency —- gender.
race. social class. coming from a
broken home. and living in the inner
city w really have relatively little in-
fluence.“ said a project scientist. Dr.

One option for students who

ditional $25 per semester but does
allow students to leave their
residence at the end of a single
semester.

But. students must hale an acccp«
table reason in order to get out of
any other housing contract. Onc stu-
dent summed it up. “It's easier to get
a divorce than it is to get out of your
housing contract."

In most cases, “kids reporting

THE MAINE DEAL

The US. Department of the In-
terior —— in a surprise move — has
come out\ in support of American lu-
dian claims to nearly 60 percent of
the entire state of Maine. Interior of-
ﬁcials. respondingto a court order to
take a public position on the 1972
suit involving two Indian tribes and
billions of dollars worth of land. say
they agree with the Indians‘ claims to
some l0.2 million acres of Maine‘s
land. The officials. however, have
asked the Justice Department to
seek a six-week delay in ruling on the
four-year-old claims so that the
Carter administration can study the
case.

The Passamaquoddy and
Penobscot tribes contend that. over
the years, their land has been given
to white settlers without Con-
gressional approval as is required by
a I790 law. The suit involves 60 per-
cent of" the state‘s land area. and
some $300 million in damages. The
suit has brought a halt to land stiles
and mortgages in some areas of
Maine and has caused serious lax
problems amonglocal communities.

DIAL-A-BRIEFCASE

Have you heard about the man
who opened his briefcase to answer
the telephone? Gene Daly of
Redwood City, California has. Daly
is the owner of the Communicators.
a four-year-old form that pcddles

one of the biggest stattu symbols of
them all — the briefcase telephone.

Daly says his company caters to
people who make at least 550.000 a
year. and can easily pay for the
$2800, l7-pound battery-operated
briefcase phone. Merely using the
phone costs a whopping SIS for the
first 25 minutes and 25 cents for each
minute thereafter. plus the regular
long distance charges. Duly says the

aVcragc monthly tab is about $60.
but many people run up bills of more
than $l200 a month. Daly says his
best briefcase customers are pimps.
because they get their cars repossess-
ed a lot and don't like our phones.

AUTOMATIC FLOP

Consumer Reports Magazine says
that "although‘electric cars may he
the autos of the future. we still havea
long way to go Ill perfecting them.
The magitzine reports that it recently
tested one of the two electric cars
currently available to the public. and
found that its performance under
driving conditions was almost com-
ical.

The test drivers discovered. for ex-
ample. that in an emergency stop the
car's front brakes broke apart. In ad-
dition. the vehicle took a lengthy I9
seconds to accelerate frotn a stan-
ding start to 30 milcsan hour.

The magazine adds that the main
fuse in the test vehicle blew out while
crossing an intersection and that the
interior noise level was twice as great
as that ofn Chevrolet pick-uptruck.

On top of everything else. the
researchers report that the car‘s mo-
tion was so jerky that on several oc-
casions the windshield-washer bag

shook loose and spilled ﬂuids into.

THE SILENT ZONE

A small triangle of land in north
central Mexico is reported to be

High Times Magazine reports that
the area — located about 200 miles
south of the Texas border — is
known as “The Silent Zone."

What's strange about the area.

High Times says. is that all forms'o’i”
radio communication are complete- V

Iy blacked out in the zone; com-
passes go haywire; forms of animal

and plant life in the Vicinity are
strangely mutant; and there a 'an
amazing abundance of fallen
meteorites strewn about the three-
square-kilometer region.

The Silentlonc was first dis-
covered in l969 by a Mexican
engineer. Harry De La Pena. who
reported that even powerful radio
signals could not .he broadcase or

TAX DEDUCTIBLE

An Illinois couple has won a land-
mark ruling from a federal tax court
which found that the higher costs of
"organic" food can be written off as a
medical expense.

The Wall Street Journal reports
the unusual ruling was handed down
in the case of an Illinois doctor and
his wife who said they developed
health problems from eating
processed foods.

According to the couple. they
switched to organic foods because
additives uttd preservatives in many
supermarket products sometimes
caused mental confusion.

eyes.

The couple asde the I.R.S. fora

medical cost for organic foods. The
Journal reports that the I.R.S. turn-
ed them down. but that an Illinois
tux court has reversed the decision.
