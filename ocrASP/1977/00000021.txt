one.
I myself do not care to travel by car over
long distances. I prefer to take the bus. The
rsavings one makes traveling byisar are just too
great to ignore. so I began looking for a lift
home for the intersessioii‘break. About twelve
’ - days before I was to leave. the charter bus line
signs I- had seen so many times before
appeared; Wouldn't believe my good fortune.
.I would be able to travel by the bus instead of
by car. and at the same time save $7.25 over
the commercial bus lines. The charter bus
would let me off at the Port Authority which.
for me. is perfect. In addition, there is always
the chance of meeting someone I know. mak-
ing the trip much more enjoyable.

When I arrived on Saturday, at 10:00A.M..
at,the Campus Center. I was told the charter
bus had been cancelled.

At this point. it was too late to geta lift. and
t I was stuck with the bus. Quite upset. I took
the bus. and I remained angry at The
American Enterprise Company for screwing
me up. .

‘ administration
axes a winner

To the Editor:
- Last semester my class learned that our
Latin teacher ,w0uld no longer be teaching at

‘Albany State. In spite of the fact that she was

considered by most of us to be one of the finest
teachers on campus. and her 23 years of ser-
vice at SUNYA. her “line was eliminated.”
These impersonal words which I had heard
so often ﬁnally became meaningful to me. I
was shocked to hear that of the few inspiring

and talented professors left at SUNYA. one »

Due to the efforts of many people.
Professor Norton was given two courses this
semester. I am not satisﬁed. however. lcannot
symuthize with the administration’s cries of
poverty when I see .SlJNYA throwing away

r money daily. The university tries to save
money by keeping the library cold. but then
wastes the money saved by leaving the lights
on after closing. How many times have you

seen three busses sitting at the same stop?‘ -

Finally, couldn't the administration find some
better use for funds than the purchase of a new
logo? It is the administration’s responsibility
to cut down on wastefulness, and to gain
access to as much funding as possible. It
should work closely with the student body to
achieve these goals. and keep students in-
formed of its progress.

I would like to say to President Fields that
Albany needs a skilled surgeon to cure the un-
iversity of its ﬁnancial illness. not merely a
butcher who cuts away the substance of a
liberal arts institution. '

gun issue:
crystal .clear

To the Editor:

- Having discussed the gun issue at some
length with two security officers, 1 now have a
better understanding of the policeman's point
of View. First, the most dangerous routine
duty of an ofﬁcer is stopping vehicles in trafﬁc
checks. If a criminal shoots an armed ofﬁcer
he has a good chance of returning ﬁre. An Lin:
armed ofﬁcer cannot do so.

Officers are tired of laying their lives on the
line. The campus security ofﬁcers asked
women if they “felt safe on this campus,“- the
implication being that guns will make it safer.
However. both officers did admit that
handguns will not deter crime.

Many people are concerned over the general

is simple. We are in an arms race with crime.
Unfortunately, most arms races develop in...

Few athletes are such “naturals” that they
step on to a varsity team without months. and
usually. years of training and conditioning.
On the Olympic and professional level the
training requirements are awssome.

Similarly. professions like law or medicine
require years of schooling. Even in academia a
demanding journey must be made before the
highest awards are granted.

We accept these requirements as basic. Rare
indeed is the person who has theahility. or the
nerve, to challenge them. And with good
reason. High skills in any area take time and
effort to develop and refine.

Given this accepted wisdom. it is strange
that so little attention is paid to citizenship
training. Once a student advances past ﬁfth
grade civics be/she seldom comes across the
term "citizenship" much less encounter a
course that offers practical citizenship ex-
perience. High school and college political
science courses are alike in this regard. Theory
is emphasized to the exclusion of practical
Work.

It's no wonder then that most students pass
through the education gauntlet blissfully un-
aware of the demands of dynamic citizenship.
Skill development is severely retarded. The
political science major upon graduation. un-
fortunately. is no better equipped to enter the
civic arena than the music or art majors.

 

Edi/or's' Now: Mr. Donald Ross Is Exerulive
Direclor- o/‘N l’l’IRG.

Extracurriculars provide no answer either.
Few schools. if any. have citizenshipcluhs. In-
stead of opportunities to investigate and probe
into the workings of government. the activities
that do exist consist of one shot visits to the
Capitol. or pIay-actingin“governor for a day"
programs.

Citizen apathy might be greatly decreased if
a fraction of the resources expended to
enhance athletics was transferred to
citizenship skill building. Most people enjoy
doing something theydo well. Iflobbying. cm-
pirical research and advocary skills are foreign
to a person. he/ she is unlikely to perform them
often. The result is a passive citizenry; willing
at best to take to the polls once a year. but
moribund in between.

This situation threatens tragedy for
democracy. Participation - skilled participa-
tion ~- in the decision making process. is es-
sential. if the citizenry‘s interests are to be serv-
ed. If the level of skilled participation
diminishes below a certain critical mass. the
consequences could be men.

It is naive to imagine that participation will
increase without special effort. Just as athletic
development takes personnel and money. tur-
ning out top quality advocates requires
resources. But these are resources that should
be amply repaid over the years. Better in-
formed. better trained public citizens will
repay large dividend. l . society. it is not too
late to start refining these skills. during the
college years.

hey.
landlord

To the Editor:

1 have waited long enough. hoping that
someone less involved with Michael Rickman
might come to his defense. Being a close friend
of his. I felt it was time I stepped in.

First. let me make myself clear. I believe
that Michael Rickman took a few too many
chances with the lives of other people. es-
pecially afterbe almost lost his own life in a
fire that occurred last May. I lived in the house
that burned down in May, but was fortunate
enough to escape without any physical in-
juries. I wish I could say the same about Ellen
Deutschman and the others who lived at 48A
Dove Street. Ifa man is guilty of one thing,
however. why accuse him of several other
things? I’m referring to the several articles in
the ASPthat made Michael Rickman appear
to be an evil, sinister person; one who is look-
ing to make a buck. at the expense of othcrs'
lives. without ever feeling guilty.

The ASP mentioned a “survey” of Off-
Cumpus students in which Michael Rickman
was described as a negligent and all-around
poor landlord. Did any ASP reporter bother
to mention that there was only one paper ﬁlled
out by a former tenant of Mr. Rickman‘l ln
statistics. a sample of one out of possible hun-
drcds is not sufﬁcient as evidence. Why then.
should the ASP use one form as a basis for
several people? Michttcl Rickman is not the
most efficient landlord vhcn it comes to repair

a

work but as landlords go. there aren't very
many good ones in Albany. Some landlords
won’t listen to hardship stories of students
who can’t pay rent; Mieliael does. He's like
any other landlord; he has many faults and
many merits. The students around SUNYA
seem to feel that this man walks around today
without any guilt feelings about the ﬁre at
Dove Street. Mr. Rickman has more compas-
sion than a lot of the students have. Why at-
tribute so many faults to a man because of one
mistake? Yes. it was a terrible mistake. buthe
realizes it as much as anyone does. The mliii
has gone through enough mud-throwing. It‘s
time to stop looking for more mud just forthe
sake of throwing something.

sorry,
Iudwlg

To the Editor:

I appreciate the ASPs attempt to mark the
birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven in their
December ll issue. however. the article by
Steven Almasi was. in most ways. superficial
and inaccurate. Mr. Almasi is dead wrong in
asserting that Beethoven‘s deafness and other
maladieswcrc caused by venereal disease. This
completely discredited hypothesis was the
result of a mis-trunslation by the American
biographer Thriycr in l850. Beethoven suf—
fered from a disease known as Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus. as described by Edward
Larkin in the book Beelhoven: The Last
Decade, by Martin Cooper. This disease is an
allergic disorder wherein the body reacts
against its own proteins. Beethoven‘s body
was, in effect. at war with itself.

Beethoven suffered enough in his own
lifetime; he should not have to suffer now from
poor scholarship.

'A'SIJNY Langston“,

For SUNY, and SUNYA. I971 has thus far been'a year of losses.
Perhaps people have become sodesensitized to budget cuts, staff
dismissals, resignations and perishing program offerings that the, 
striking string of losses recently haunting SUNY has gone unnoticed. I

First there is the sad saga of SUNYA‘s seemingly annual budget cut. _
This year'Governor Carey's proposed budget stands to top $539,000.0ut .’ '
of SUNYA’s state support. even though the SUNY systgi’ipn the whole ‘ .
received a slight increase. ' '  '

So support for higher education at SUNYA continues to decline, and ,
one can expect that the quality of education at SUNYA will also decline 
as dollars grow more scarce. Certainly. SUNYA shall survive -‘-—
students will come and go and graduate with their degrees. But if the
trend continues the scope of programs will narrow, leaving students with
less choice; no opportunity to pursue a diverse program of study.

Even now, strapped by budget cuts, SUNYA President Emmett
Fields is in the process of funneling resources into programs geared
toward public policy analysis.

Before the welts sustained in the budget beating even began to lose
their sting, SUNYA was dealt yet another slap in the face. The State
Supreme Court ruled that Education Commissioner Ewald Nyquist was
within the law in l975 when be terminated the history and English
doctoral programs at SUNYA. The Court ruled that the commissioner
does have the authority to approve and terminate specific programs
within the SU NY system. For SUNYA, the loss of two doctoral
programs. For SUNY, a loss of power and sovereignty. ' _

Again the trend here is a dangerous one. The business of education is .
drifting out of the hands of educators and into the hands of. state
bureaucrats where it is sure to become less effectiVe and less effiCient.

And finally, SUNY lost its chancellor, Ernest Boyer, to the Carter
boys in Washington. At least he was lost for a good cause.
