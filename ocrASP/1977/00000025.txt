'Stil Raging
WASHINGTON (AP) Represen-
V tatives _ of the National Football
League owners and the players on-
ion will meet Monday in New
' Oileans in yet another session in an
' effort to resolve their three-year dis-
pute over a new collective bargaining
agreement.

Ed Garvey. executive director of
the union. said the players hope that
by'the end of the bargaining session
the two sides “can know what issues -
separate us. We hope that by the
time we get out of New Orleans we
can prettymuch mirror the issues."

Garvey said the players to be on
hand are union vice presidents Len
Hauss of the Washington Redskins
and Gene Upshaw of the Oakland
Raiders and executive committee

with Muhammad Ali, who took the"
titration: himvin 1974. _

‘ 'Foret'mtn'went through his match
with Agosto as though he were
perfecting techniques in a training
session.

“I used,to punch more like this."
said Fore'man imitating the looping.

for. “The men. Charlie Shipes and

Shor said his first legitimate job
was selling shirts—“I was a hell of a
good salesman"~after an appren-
ticeship in Philadelphia's pool halls.
In his 20's he took a job in a
Prohibition-era speakeasy where he
met and was fascinated by high-
Iiving celebrities and show people.

Shor was a host at various bars
and nightspots through the l930's.
In 1940, he opened his own place on

reportedly with considerable finan-
cial help from his friends.

e.“ That establishment was sold for a
disregard for most reported 515 million in 1958 to
make way for a luxury hotel.

One of Shor's personality traits
was a winning self-effacement. For
example. he refused to be called a
"restaurateur." “I‘m just a creepy
saloonkecper," he insisted, “and I
ain‘t ashamed of it."

Shor had lived for years at a
fashionable Park Avenue address.

 penetrating the ‘Albany defense.

    

Crotty ﬁnally ended the streak with

t. eight minutelleft‘ih the halfwben ~ '

she converted an offensive rebound
to bring Albany within ten.

But lightning struck again.
Following Crotty‘s basket. the .
Danettes were unable to put the ball
in the basket for the next five full ' ' '
minutes. as Potsdam exploded for l4
unanswered pointsf Five different
Potsdam Women scored in that
stretch as the fast-break was usedto
perfection.

Albany was also unable to keep
the visitors off their offensive boards

. as the taller Bears just kept getting
inside and maintaining control. The
Danettes did have, their oppor-
tunities but could not connect with
their shots while falling prey to lur-
novers.

Finally Sugihara connected on a
layup off 3 Nancy Bartle pass to end
the scoring drought. That seemed to
wake up Albany as they reeled off
the final seven points of the half to
cut the gap to Is.

Sugihara had the hot hand down
the stretch as she popped in two
jumpers. scoring eight of the

t Danettes' l7 half time points.

. Pomerville and Sally Venecia also

'tolalled eight for Potsdam at the
halfway point.

The second half opened with a
Pomerville layup. but that was
answered by a Bartle hoop and a
Foley bank shot. The l3-point
margin. at 34-2l. was to be the
closest Albany would get the entire
afternoon. ~

With Nancy Schappcrt doing
most of the rebounding and Pomer-
ville and Laurie Reynolds doing
most of the running and scoring.
Potsdam was unstoppable. Albany‘s
starting five tired in that second half
and were unable 0 keep pace with
the fresh Potsdam substitutions.
Only Crotty. with nine second half
points. was able to do anysigniﬁcant
damage.

The only thing in doubt was
whether or not Potsdam would hit
70 points, and they did that with a
minute to spare. Pomerville led all
scorers with IS .points while
Reynolds snared I4 for the Bears.
For Albany. Sugihara tallied 12
while Crotty chipped in with ll
points.

The most notable difference inthe
final statistics was the rebounding.
Potsdam garnered 18 in the second
half. while Albany was able to snare
only a meager six.

Tomorrow night the Danettes
travel to Russell Sage where they will
attempt to halt their losing streak.
before moving to Castleton the
following week.
