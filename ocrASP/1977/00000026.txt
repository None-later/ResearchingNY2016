Smoking Banned In Class
To Combat Health Hazard

by Jonathan Hodges

SUNYA President Emmett Fields
has authorized implementation of a
ban on classroom smoking. in
response to a recommendation from
the University Senate‘s Environmen-
tal Decisions Commission.

Thc ban. which would prohibit
smoking in all classrooms and fee—
ture centers. will be instituted to
combat a “serious health hazard“.
according to EDC JCo-Chairman
Louis lsmay.

Health Issue

“It‘s basically a health issue.“ said
lsmuy. “it‘s a serious situation and i
think we have a moral responsibility
to the community. We don‘t allow
people to go around shooting other
people. we should not allow smokers
to affect the health of non-smokers.“

At present. plans for the new
policy's implementation lies in the
hands ofVicc President for Univorsi-
ty Affairs Lewis Welch. According
to Welch. a committee has been
formed to draft a communication to
members of the university.

in a memo addressed to Welch
datedNovember. 1975 from SUNY
Associate Counsel Thomas Win-
field. it was determined that Chapter
80 of the Laws of I975 banning
smoking in public places did not
apply to campus classrooms.

"As far as I know. this (the l975
law) is the most recent and most

_ .....-...¢.r__ “wm - , :v . . ,

definitive legislation on the subject."
said Welch. “While it‘s not illegal to
smoke ina classroom. we hopetoen-
courage an attitude change that will
be sufficient in itself to stop smok-
ing.“

According to Welch. classrooms
will be posted to remind people that
smoking is not encouraged. The new .
policy would affect the entire cam-
pus. with individual classes no
longer being allowed to decide for
themselves whether or not smoking
would be permitted.

Student reaction on the subject
was mixed. Central Council Chair-
man Greg Lessne agreed with the
committee‘s recommendations and
urged full implementation. Council
member Cary Klein opposed EDC'S
