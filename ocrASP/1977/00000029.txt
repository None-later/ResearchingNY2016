Center units may be going up. accor- '

ding to UAS' general manager
Norbert Zahm. . -

“We haven‘t had a price increase
in about one and a half years and we
may have to think of one." said
Zahm.

“Mainly. the reason is because the.

cost of food has gone up. We have to
buy, essentially, in the same market
everyone else does. We do get a
break because we buy in much bigger
quantities. but after a while with in-
ﬂation. even that starts to whittle
away."
Price Increases

According to Zahm. the price in-
creases would zero in on “luxury”
items. such as desserts and cakes.

“We realize that the students have
a small. pocketbook.“ said Zuhm.

There are many different factors

involved in the needfor price. in?"

creases

One of the reasons. according to
Zahm. is that thesnack bar‘was clos-
ed the entire summer becausevof
remodelling. This forced the
cafeteria . which is more expensive to
run. to stay open. therefore puttinga
big loss on campus center units.

“Vacations may be great for the
students, but they- ruin our cash
operations.“ said Zahm. "In the
summer. you can lay people‘off. but
during the small vacations. you can‘t
lay a fulltime crew oft'a day hereand
l| few days there. You would lose
them.“
