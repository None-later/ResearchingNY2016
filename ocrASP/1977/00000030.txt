The trustees point outthst SUNY I
had been freed from the Regents‘
after the proposals of former Gover-
nor] Nelson Rockei‘eller's: .‘Heald
commission wereadopted in 1969.
The Commission had recommended .
that SUNY‘s “powers of self-
determination. should be extended
and clarified'to bring them up to
Ievei‘which is taken for granted by
the great public universities of this
nation." Otherwise. the.Commission ,
warned. SUNY “will never be able
. . . to attain the stature of a great
state institution.“

Recently. the trustees claim.
“moves have been made which
would . . . make State University
once again a del'acto administrative
unit within'the Education Depart-
ment.“ 'l'hcy recdmmend the
“responsibility for . . . budgets.
capital programs. academic
programs. and projected
enrollments should be retained by
the institutional governing boards.“
They add that “operational control
by an outside body not directly
responsible to the elected branches is

.unfeasible and undesirable."

Smoking Ban

continued from page one
ﬁndings and attacked Fields‘ deci-
sion to ban smoking.

“If Dr. Fields would like to stop
people from smoking in the lecture ~
centers because of their health and
the students health.“ said Klein. "let
him stop smoking in his own ofﬁce
and in all the administration offices
because we need a healthy presi-
dent.“

A German weekly mhguine
claims that the Pentagon has a secret
contingency plan. code-named “Pro-

__ -ject Camelot.” which calls for‘“en’
'_ American blockadetof Quebec by

land. sea and water should the
province ever secede" from Canada.

The magazine: ’ Der .Spiegel. ‘
published 5 in 'Haritburg. alleges that
the plan exists because Canadian
observers and top U.S. military of-
ficials fear that
become another Cuba.

The Der Splegle article. which was
republished in the United States this
week by Atlas World Press Review.
says. “one can only speculate how
President Carter' 'would react to
[Quebec‘s secession]. But for years
the Pentagon has maintained a thick
file labeled “Project Camelot." This
secret document sees Canada as a
“danger spot" on a par with Africa
and Latin America and calls for an
American blockade of Quebec . . .
should the province ever secede."

Jesus Christ stands tocollect some
544.000 on the occasion of his se-

A British man who died last year
has bequeathed this handsome sum
to Christ if he returns within the next
80 years. specifically “to reign on
earth.“ and if he proves his identity
to the British government.

weeo TAX .

The Drug Abuse Council has
compiled a new study which con-
cludes that the federal government is
losing at least Sl.8 billion annually
as a result of its failure to legalize and
then‘tax marijuana.

The Washington. D.C.-bttsed
council. the largest private drug
research organization in America.
says that its tax estimates are based
on actual government figures about
marijuana smokers and how much
ther currently pay for the weed.

According to researchers Eric

DIVINE DEATH

Uganda‘s President ldi Amin says
that the fatal heart attack last week
of actor Peter Finch was caused by
God. and that other actor deaths will
follow.

Finch died five days after he had
appeared in a television ﬁlm
dramatizing lsrael‘s raid to rescue
hostages at the Entebbe Air Field in
Uganda. Godfrey Cambridge. an ac-
tor who had been scheduled to .
protray Amin in the ﬁlm. collapsed
and died—also ofa heart attack—on
the set last November.

Amin. upon learning of Finch's
death. stated he had predicted that
God would punish those who par-
ticipated in the movie. and warned
that other deaths will follow. Finch
had played the part of Israeli Prime

in- America who consume about 3.2
billion joints a year.

The study found that, on the basis
of tobacco industry cost figures.

that current pot smokers pay an
average of $512 per pound. II‘ this
difference of about $505 per pound
