thitthc present has situa-
' _  than last year. Last
he early pm of last semester. I

   

iitl‘éias fifteen minutes before the class started
nd‘rcst assured that I wouldn't be late. If I

u-in the mood,.l.could walk one block down ‘

ochairsnem‘hdmhhminimai pushing and

if This semester it secms‘that everyone at
lumni has ﬁnally realized the beneﬁts of the.
stir to Quail Street. In addition to the usual
rowd at Partridge, there is now a crowd at
uail waiting for the, bus. Pretty soon there
ill‘be a crowd waiting at Draper Hall.

There must be a reason for these crowds at

he bus stops. One reason might be that the
buses are not at the stops at the scheduled
imcs. As a seasoned downtown resident, I
have gotten into the habit of always having a
schedule handy. I have often waited for buses
that never appeared.

It is quite possible that there will be an in-
crease in the use of the buses if. after Mohawk
Tower is converted into a dormitory, the va-
cant office space at the downtown campus is
used. As it stands right now, I consider the bus
situation to be one of the university's highest
priorities. Although SUNYA is going through
some budget difficulties. there should be some
effort directed toward the improvement of the
bus system. At least. there should be buses
running at the scheduled times. While waiting
for buses I have heard enough complaints to
know that I‘m not the only one that feels this
way.

Tothe Editor:

ldon't care what Stephen Eiscnman thinks I
said. What I actually did say in my December
10 Bcethoycn article is something entirely
different. I shall consider his prclcnsc at
criticism point by point.

He terms my essay “in most ways superficial
and inaccurate." Rather than substantiate this
vague attack. he goes into it tirade against a
single aspect of my story. He claims I am
“dead wrogg“ in assertingthut Bccthovcn died
of syphilis. With a brave display of adjectives
he cites some l850's American author its proof
of my mistake. 7

l asserted nothing; to quote from my article.
I stated this was a “speculated” cause of his
demise. My source for speculation was not the
American Thuycr. but rather Grave's Dic~
Iionary of Music.

The incredible pcttiness of Mr. Eiscnmitn's

"complaint 'is' heightens
’ written" citation he. offered jcx ,
,, Beethoven's infirmity. Aside from 'thc17ap-,r

parent conclusion to be draivn here—that
has nothing better to do than look up the cor-
rect Latin names for diseases—l find his
"assertion" harder to believe than my
“speculation!” ' .

In view of the childisth malicious point of
his letter. I must take Mr. Eiscnman to task for
misspelling my name. A man writing all the
way from Plattsburgh was kind enough, in his
letter published last Friday, to spell my name.
correctly. Mr. Eiscnman. who spells even his
own first name Stephen spelled mine Steven.
For an ctr-arts editor and supposed journalist.
this is rather slipshod.

To aid in the cure of what I suspect is a bad
case of sour grapes. might I suggest that, next
time. Mr. Eiscnman buckle down and try to
write intelligently!

To the Editor:

On behalf of Coach Saucrs and the entire
SUNYA Basketball team. I wanttothank the
Pep Band for fine performances at our home
games. Your musical renditions have been a
great asset to our pcrformiincc on the court.
They have provided us with the incentive and
support to do our best for our school. The
music has also provided a great "boost" to the
crowd, which is naturally in our favor. Thcir
anxiety is our fuel.

We look forward to the Pop Band's con-
tinued association with the SUNYA Basket-
ball tcamf.

a job well done

To the Editor:

i The sum of $403.00 was contributed by
SUNYA cmployccs toward the Joan E.
Richburg Reward Fund. which is being ad-
ministered“ by the Mechanics Exchange
Savings Brink of Albany. If this money is not
used for it rcwurd it will be used for an
educational endoncnt for Miss Richburg‘s
brothers and sisters.

To all who contributed so gcncrously, and
especially to the employees who volunteered
their time soliciting for the fund. many thanks
for it job wcll donc.

the liberty to objectively report en,.scrutinizc and serve the university
community. StudentA'ssociation critics have complained that the ASP 1 '
is becoming less of a" student group as it drifts furtherand further from _
SA. Such criticisms are absurd. The ASP is, and always will be, student-
run and student-managed. The only difference, between the ASP and." .
most other student groups is that the ASP consumes no portion of the > L' I 1
student tax dollar. The r ASP supports itself, while providing the ' '
university at large with an invaluable medium for communication —-—' a
newspaper. ' ' ‘

In an effort to better serve its readership, the ASP has stepped up its
public service announcement program, giving various organizations the
opportunity to be heard. Most recently the ASP has agreed to include
the financially troubled Towcr Tribune as a regular Tuesday feature.
The ASP has no desire to control the contents of the Tower Tribune —‘
and it shall not, as all material appearingin the Tower Tribune will still
originate from the Office of Community Relations. Rather, the ASP
views "this as a valuable service for a large segment of its readership.

The ASP is' often the target of ridicule and criticism from its
readership. The criticism is appreciated, the ridicule is tolerated, while
both are expected.

Journalists learn to live with the fact that they will receive fcw
compliments when no errors are made, but be castigated for mistakes.
That’s the way the business works, and they accept it. But it's harder to
accept when there's no other compensation to look forward to. An
occasional pat-on-the-back can keep a student journalist going.

There is a certain magic about newspapers. They just seem to appear.
out of nowhere, in crisp fresh bundles at the newsstand — or in the
Campus Center. But remember, there are people breaking their backs to
make sure that the magic works. There are editors '~ students — staying
up until five or six o’clock in the morning; struggling to get the paper
finished on deadline so that the magic can continue.

These people are not, nor do they claim to be, heroes or pcrfectionists.
They make mistakes. They also work thirty and forty hours per week to
provide SUNYA with a newspaper —— and they ask for very little in
return. . '

But damn it, at least they deserve a “thanks”.
