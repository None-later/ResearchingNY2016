 Is there Judo in Albany? Yes, and
it's'alive and well. SUNYA Judo

tuniiy to be involved in a regular ex-
ercise program ~while receiving
"superior instruction in'a formidable
style of self defense.

z The club‘s instructor. Mr.
Noriyasu Kudo. 6th degree black
belt. is one ol'thc country‘s most
respected Judo players and instruc-
‘tors. Throughout class the Japanese
tradition is maintained with

emphasis on the Japanese ideals of

respect. courtesy and
sprotsmanship. Of course the Judo
taught here is Amcricanired.

The club is ctr-educational and
members work at their own pace.
creating a relaxed yet serious sport
atmosphere. Herein lies the excep-

 
 

tional aspect of SUNYA Judo; it‘ in

_ sport at which people play. 1 _
During thecoursc of this-play a .v

and works into sound physical
shape. Not a game of strength. but
rather one of agility and strategy.
Judo is ideal for men and women
alike. Annual Activities Day
demonstrations and regular par-
ticipation in local and national tour-
naments provide an opportunity for
members to display their skills as
Judo players.

Although the Danes have last a SUNYAC contest. they still are sitting
pretty. Onconta has two conference losses already and may not even catch
the Danes. It won‘t be easy. but Albany still has it good shot at winning the
conference. And think of it: they don‘t have to visit Oneonta until about
