snapped ~a 47-47 tie and led the
Albany junior varist basketball
team to a 49-47 victory over Oneonta
Tuesday night. at the Red Dragons'
homecourt. - ,

*Wcan't “get a game that’s a
breather.” said Albany j.v. coach Bill
Austin afterward. f‘l said earlier that
if we kept them (Oneonta) under 60,
we‘d win. But they (Albany) had me
worried at the end.”

The game had both coaches fret-
ting. .First one team would get hot
while the other couldn't ﬁnd the
basket, and then the roles would be
reversed as the scoring “touch,”

’ would suddenly reappear.

For instance, after both teams had
traded buckets to start off the game,
Oneonta found the range and
couldn't miss. From a 2-2 tie the
score soared to l2-2 Oneonta;

thanks mainly to Tim Doherty’s six

points. When the Pups broke the “-

skein on a Januszewski offensive
rebound and layup. it was their turn.

And they didn’t know when to
stop. The Red Dragons' uncanny ac-
curacy only moments earlier was
reduced to a poorly taken shot every
so often as the Pups dominated.
When the streak was over. the
visitors had scored l6 consecutive
points to take an l8-12 lead.
Januszewski tallied six of the Pups'
points in that stretch while Rich
Woods and Darrell Grant added
four each.

The Pups opened it up to 20-l3 a
moment later. but then fell apart
again. Over the ﬁnal six minutespf
the half, Albany was only able'to
convert two baskets, as Oneonta
reyined its scoring touch. Four
different Dragon players found the
mark in that spree as the hosts went
on a l3-4 tear to lead 26-24 at the

half.

Neither team shot consistently
well in that half and the turnovers
were the rule rather than the excep-

- tion as they characteriled both clubs'

sputtering offense maneuverings.

Darrell Grant opened things up in
the second half as he popped in a
quick jumper to tie things at 26. But
then Oneonta's Tim Doherty sunk a
free throw, Greg George came up
with a steal and driving layup.
Charlie Godsmark connected. and
George hit again as the hosts roared
out to a ﬁve-point lend.

Both clubs were still shooting
below par. trying to force the ball in
the basket rather than set up for
good shots. The game resembled
more a playground shoot-out than a

college junior varsity tilt.

With ten minutes remaining.
Oneonta still clung to its slim lead.
now only four points. At this point.
the Red Dragons decided to freeze
the ball. passing out to their "point"
guards at mideouri
Albany came too close. The strategy
worked well for a time until Oneonta
tried to shoot. Then they usually
missed.

After one of these misses, Albany
came downcourt. put up a shot that
also was off the mark. but was for-
tunate enough to have Enos‘
Williams in the right spot to lay it in.
With Albany trailing 43-4l now.
Oneonta decided to stall some more.
When they did shoot. the shot was
no good and Albany came up with it.

After three chances to score on
offensive rebounds. the Pups failed
to convert and Oneonla connected.

With three minutes left. Rich
Woods connected for Albany to br-
ing them to within two at 45-43.
Oneonta‘s .loe Regan then missed
and Albany came down and scored
on Craig Field's l0-footer.

With two minutes remaining, -
Regan connected on both ends of a
“one-and-one" free throw situation
to give the lead back toOneonta. But
Fields came right back witha l7-foot
swish to knot it once more. Tile
Dragons went intotheir stall. hoping
for thellast shot. but Januszewski
tied up Regan to force a jump ball
with 4| seconds remaining. '

Januszcwski won the tap. raced'
downcourt, took a feed pass from
Gram, drove the middle. and con-
nected on a blink shot for the game,-
winning play. The Dragons had one
more chance to tie but elected to
hold the ball for the last shot and
ncvci' got il oil.

“Our offense is just not producing
for us."snid Austin al'lerthc game. “I
didn‘t see one decent screen out
there. We have no patience in that
mnn-to-man ol'l‘ensc: we're just try-
ing to run through them."

Al least the defense played well~
and the I’ups did win. Tomorrow the
