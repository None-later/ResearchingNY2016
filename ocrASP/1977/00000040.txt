There are some problems the team
has been facing this year that Garcia
mentioned. He said that he can‘t get
as involved with the team as much as
he would like because he is an ad-

Hofstra Nips Women

by Christine Bellini

Semester break proved to heme
long a rest for the Albany State
women's gymnastics team. as they
fell to the Hofstra Islanders at home
Saturday.

"We had five days to practice since
our last contest in early December."
said Albany Coach Edith Cobanc.
“The long lay-off really httrt us; it
could have been a close mcct."

Hofstrn took the match withaten-
point win. 89.40 to 79. IO on Sutur-
day.

The Danettcs lost their “home ad-
vantage" in the first event. dropping
behind by six points to llofstra's
vaulters. Albany entry Julie Acton
scored relatively ‘Iowur titan her
usual performances with a team high
of 5.10 points. Following closely
behind was Mary Ann Capcrnn. an
experienced freshman recruit. who
also had difficulty matching her
better scores with n 5.05.

"We should do very well on
vaulting and did not“. commented
Cobnnc. “They (Albany) all did
handspring vaults safely but in poor
form. It's an explosive event and has

' to become almost habit to perform it

well."

Although Acton did a “beautiful
routine" on theuoevens. scoring a
solid 7.0. her teammates did little to
beat her mark. totaling 7.85 in all.

Midway through the meet. the
Danettes trailed 34.30 to Hofstra‘s
