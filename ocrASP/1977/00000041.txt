programs.

The appeal is the latest phase in a
dispute between the two education
authorities over who has power to
terminate academic programs at
SUNY schools.

Nyquist killed. the SUNYA
programs after receiving results
from a statewide review project
charged with evaluatingthedoctorul

program came in Sept. I975 and
three months later the English doc-
torate program met the same fate.

“We used outside consultants —
not from that state v and they ad-
vised us. and our own expert staff
concurred. to terminate." said Ny.
quist. “We found that the programs
at Albany were of low quality."

The decision did not sit well with
the Board of Trtlstces. who ﬁled a
suit against the State Education
Department on Feb. 25. l976.

"This review report was a study
paper. not the equivalent of a
statute." said SUNY attorney Walter
J. Relihau. Jr. "We participated ful-
ly. thinking it would he used to help
guide the programs. However. we
did not expect orders front the
Regents to terntinate the programs."

The report rated the programs- by
three categories: acceptable.
quaiifiably acceptable. and to-be-
terminated. Both the history and
English programs were rated in the
last category.

“It was felt that the doctoral
programs in history and English
needed to be strengthened." said
Relihan. “History. for example. was
judged to be in the intermediate
category except for the fact that
there was a lack of faculty of
national eminence.“

group goes over all ofthc institutions
and compares the programs. Finally.
a recommendation is made."
“There is a whole range of things
to he looked at." continued Nyquist.
“You look at the quality ofthe facul-
ty. the prestige they have. the
number of things they‘ve published
and what they‘ve published. You
look at the number and caliber of
students » although evaluation of
the caliber is subjective. You put all
the factors together. We found the
programs to be of low quality.“
“The Commissioner ordered that
programs be closed.“ said Rclihan.
“At that point. we felt he
overstepped his legal bounds.“

SA Contracts With Law Firm Questioned

by Bryan Holzberg

SA has retained the law firm of
Rosenblum and Leventhal for legal
services for the past six years. but ac-
cording to SA President Steve
DiMco. has never closely examined
the quality of these services or the
possible alternatives

“We probably should check“ if
other law firms could offer a better
deal on services or if complaints
against Rosenblum and Levcnthal
are numerous and with merit. said
DiMeo.

Such considerations have not
played a role before as SA presidents
routiner signed a contract with the
law firm. according to DiMeo and
former SA offi ' ils. Di Meo said one
of his first acts in office was to sign
the $l0,000 Rosenblum and
Leventltal contract “to ensure
students had legal services." He said
he did ttot question that service.

“From time to time SA has inter—
viewed other law firms." said San-
ford Rosenblunt. senior partner in
the firm. Former SA officials con—
tactctl said no such interview oc-
curred.

"The lawyer‘s code of professional
responsibility forbids bidding forthc
SA retainer "said Rosenblum. “but
there's nothing to prevent SA from
talking to other lawyers.“

Rosenblum said the retainer ser-
vice provides: for initial proceedings
for all students arrested. “getting
them out ofjail and back to class as
quickly as possible;" free consulta-
tion for students on any matter in-
cluding two hours each Tuesday

night in the SA office; advisory
memos to SA upon the request of
any of its officers; occasional special
sessions with students on legal rights
including housing discrimination.
jobs. etc.: attd fttll legal defense ser»
vices to ten individuals such as EOP-
SA shall certify.

Rosenblum said he believes SA
retains his firm for legal services by
virtue of “a reputation developed
over the years in working with
students and a developed repository
of expertise.“

Former SA President l’at Curran

said in a memo to Rosenblum in
May l975 that "apparently this
[$l0.000] can now find its way into
the SA budget with itseyes closed.“

Central Council created the
Health Safety and Law committee
last year which had among its
assignments to examine the
Roscnblum and Levanthal service
and to consider alternatives to thent.
One suggestion. made but never
studied, was to use Albany Law
School interns to provide some of
the service which would reduce the
retainer fee. according to a former

Roger Markovics of Albany Un-

group. said “we would like tosee stu-

Rosenblum. u'l'hey tnust come to us
and we act within parameters of
what students ask us to do and
opinions under the retainer."
R osenhlum said his firm had
represented students in small claims
court at times when strong action
was needed. “We don‘t expect to be
payed for it. it's not in the retainer
contract." he said.

Markovics said “there's a big gray
area in legal counseling. Rosenblum
and Leventhal tell the safe thing to
do. 'l'hey‘vo done their professional
duty but it‘s not worth the ten
grand."

Rosenblum said that through his
firm‘s continued contract. a number
of contacts have been made which
can be used to helpstudents. He add-
ed that “a powerful factor in_out‘
favor is dealing with whom you
know. The ﬁrm knows how to deal
efficiently with a large number of
students." .

Relihan said SUNY‘s contention
that Nyquist exceeded his authority
is based on legislation enacted in
I96! which provided. for a Master
Plan. The legislation. according to
Relihau. “removed SUNY from the
direct control ol the Board of
Regents."

The Master Plan provided the
Board ot’l'rustees a process by which
every four years they must submit
plans for approval by the Regents
and the (iovernor. said Relihan.

SUNY ot'licials argue that the
legislation placed final responsibility
for implementation of the Master
Plan with the Board of 'l'rustees.

According to Section l3.2 of the
Rules of the Regents “the Com-
missioner [Nyquist] may. after
notice and opportunity to be heard.
rescind the registration of any in-
stitution which fails to maintain the
approved standard of equipment
and instruction. . 

“Unfortunately. the statutory en-
vironment does give strength to both
sides of the conflict." said SUNYA
l’residcnt Emmett Fields. “it‘s a
matter of preference as to which of
the existing statutes is given greater
weight." /

Through the l9()l legislation. the
Board of 'I'rustecs contends that it
was "by law. finally responsible for
curriculum development. acadentic
quality and tor initiating recommen-
dations regarding the introduction
or elimination of programs at the un-
iversity campuses.“

“SUNY does not believe. despite
what the papers say. that the Regents
doesn't have any role whatever,“ said
Fields. "ll prefers that the matter of
program registering and deregister-
ing be construed under the Master
Plan."

The SUNY lawsuit is the first time
that legalaction has been initiated by
SUNY against the Board of Regents.

"The Master Plan played no part
in the reviewing process." said
Relihau. “We argued that there are
