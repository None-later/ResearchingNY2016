'; The p account was',widely'

But‘in fact. thc‘Crazy Homicides
gang is made uplmostly of youths
who can'hear: the arrested. youths

' said only one of them is inthe gang;

there is no known gang of deaf
youths in New York; and none of
those-arrested is mute.

Police apparently were left with
the impression of gang membership
aftc'r struggling to get information
from the youths.

Critics say much misinformation
is the result of police officers‘ inabili-

‘ ty todeal with the deaf. They alsosay
the court system is unable to cope.

The arresting officer Jan. 8 said he
saw the youths jam a folded
newspaper into the gasoline tank ofa
car and light it. He said he pulled the
ﬂaming paper from the car before
any damage was done.

The youths' version of the story is
that most of them walked away from

I the car when they realized that one of

their groupwas forcing two others to
set fire to the paper.

Police and the youths agree that
the youths ran off in two groups
when the arresting officer and his
partner began to chase them. One.
group was captured and driven to
the precinct station; the other group
was arrested when they went to the
station voluntarily to find out what
had happened to their friends. .

A police lieutenant who said he
knew rudimentary sign language
because his daughter is deaf inter-
preted for the youths at the time of
their arrest. He later said none ofthe
youths admitted being gang
members.

liut the arresting officer. who
reported that the group was a gang.
said one boy were a gang jacket.
several wore red bandanas and the
families of two of the boys expressed
concern about gang activity.

Nearly two days after their arrest.
tlte youths commttnicated for the
first time with lawyers and were
released from custody.

Interviews with the youths. their
families. defense lawyers and others
familiar with the case indicate that
the youths were together because
they attended the same social clubs
or schools and shared an interest in
basketball. Only one of the ID
arrested youths admits to being
a member of the Crazy
llomicidcs.

PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) The
stubby. dart-like Space Shuttle —

‘ half rocket. half airplane — is ready

for a road trip to a convened desert
dry lake to answer an important
question: Will it ﬂy?

The loo-ton delta-winged cargo
carrier. designed to zoom back and
forth from earth to orbit in a few
years. was hooked to a tractor that
would pull it at a stately five to ten
miles an hour Monday to Edwards
Air Force Base. 36 miles away.

The |22-foot-long orbiter with its
53-f00t-high vertical tail ﬁn and its
convoy of security vehicles was ex-
pected to attract hundreds of spec-
tators as it crept along paved roads
on a 90-wheel trailer rig. starting at
sunrise.

The convoy was to reach its tem-
porary home at the Dryden Flight
Research Center at Edwards by late
afternoon. said ofﬁcials of the
National Aeronautics and Space

' Administration.

The reusable orbiter craft is
designed to be ﬁred intospace by dis-
posable rockets. carry out scientific
or technological work in orbit. then
soar back home through the earth's
atmosphere without power and land
like a glider.

Testing will begin Feb. l8. At first.
the craft will be attached piggy-back
atop a Boeing 747jumbo jet. In this
pilotiess set-up. the mated aircraft
will roll along the deﬁert airstrip in
taxi tests. then go aloft in a series of
"captive" flight trials “just tosee how

Calling earthworms by their

one way to do it. Caddie thinks. Last

Worms are “a potential source of
food to human beings.“ Caddie says.
though he admits "they are
something of an acquired taste."

We're looking forward to an executive job using

leadership skills we learned in the ROTC program.
Talk about options. We can go directly into an

veteran NASA astronaut who a in
charge of the approach and landing
tests. ,
The ﬁrst manned ﬂight in which
the orbiter will be released from the
carrier plane to swoop down for a
landing is scheduled for July 22.
Most ofthe tests will be run witha
streamlined cone in place over the
giant rocket nozzles that extend
from the tail ofthe shuttle‘s fuselage.
The shield was designed to prevent

.buffeting by the wind that could

make the jumbo jet unstable.
Rookie Crew

Crews for the tests have been
training on jet airplanes modified to
behave the way the gliding orbiter
will act. Only one of the pilots ——
Fer Hnisc.42 has llown in space.

The other three test pilots are
Charles (3. Fullerton. Joe Engle and
Richard H. ’I‘ruly. They will not
nec sarin pilot the slttittle on its
first flight into space. scheduled for
I979.

In guiding lltc sltuttlc orbiter to a
landing it touches down on wheels
like an airplane landing gear the
pilots will be aided by a highly
sophisticated computer systctn.
There are four computers on board.
and if necessary the entire landing
can be carried out by an automatic
pilot. Slayton said.
