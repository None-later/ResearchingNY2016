Paciﬁc News Service is reporting7

that. with the fall of the royal houses:

in Cambodia and Laos. reigning
monarchies are fast becoming'an en-
dangered species. In fact. survivors
are so worried about the royal turn
ol'evcnts over the past few years that
they have reportedly banded
together to prevent their ownextinc-
tion. ‘ - I '
Pacific News quotes reports from
Tokyo that royalty in Japan.
Thailand. Saudi Arabia and Iran
have founded an alliance of the
.world's monarchies. and adds that
emissaries may soon be our
recruiting among the crowned heads
of Europe to bolster the rapidly dy-
ing royal tradition.

OBSCENE POINTER

“Giving the ﬁnger." or raising the
middle finger in a gesture of con-
tempt has been ruled offensive. but
“not obscene" by a thrcejudge state
panel in Hartford. Connecticut.

The decision was handed down in
the case ot'a l6-year—old high school
student who had been fined $25 for
flushing the gesture at a state trooper
while the policeman was following
his school bus.

In an opinion written by Judge
Leo Parskey. the panel ruledthat for
“the finger to be obscene..it must be
significantly erotic or arouse sexual
interest. The judge wrote that neither

seems to be the case. Judge Parsltey.
in a historical digression. went on to
say that the one-digit gesture dated
back at least to ancient Greece.when
the philosopher Diogenes insulted
the orator Demosthenes by raising
the middle ﬁnger during one of
Demosthenes‘ speeches.

' ANIMAL oeuocioe A

Humans are currently working on ‘

a draft proposal to the United

. Nations to establish the ﬁrst *Bill of

Rights" for animals. The document.
drafted‘along the same lines as the
“llill of Rights of Man.“ reportedly
condemns “bulllighting. safaris.
hunting. pigeon shooting and
cockl'tghting“ as “biocide.” The new
animal rights bill also states that
‘“The massacre of baby seals and the
extermination of certain species such
as the leopard. shall be regarded as
genocide."

The document. drafted by animal
protection societies all over the
world for presentation to the United
Nations. reportedly stresses that
‘frespect for animals is‘linked to the
respect of man for man."

reporting that the radical white hate
group is “so inept“ that they have
trouble burning crosses. ~' .
The commission recently issued a
report on the K.K.K. which
describes one typical, cross-lighting

ceremony which had been infiltrated '

by investigators. The report states:
“While the men were trying to raise
the 60 foot cross. the ropes snapped.
'The cross crashed back to earth.
almost crushing several Klanamen.

Then they decided to chop off ten
feet from the bottom to make the
cross lighter and easier to raise.

"After taking a few swings. the
Klansmen wielding the only
available ax missed his mark and
broke the handle in half. He had to
finish thejob with a hatchet. In all. it
took almost three hours for the
Klansmen to raise and secure the
cross."

When everything else was ready.
the Klansmcn could not get the cross
to burn because. the report con-
tinues. “The Klansmen had wrapped
the cross in a flame retardant rug pad
instead of the usual burlap.“ The
report concludes that rather than be-
ing a threat to the community. "the
Klan of today belongs in a comic
strip.“

onoamc PANIC; '

Have you ever heard a plant
scream when it has been over-

fertilized. or a shrub ask for'a arias

of water? ", 
A new device featured at thegllong
Kong toy and gift‘ fair reportedly

gives you the ability to understand V
your plants. The instrument. a two-1

pronged fork fitted with a special
microphone. is called the “Plant
Communicator." According to its
manufacturers. you simply push it
into the soil next to a shrub and
listen.

A well-nourished plant is said to
give out an even. contented hum. in-
dicatingthat it's satisﬁed. If the plant
gets ihirsty. a low-level throb like
heart-beat begins. which speeds up
steadily as the shrub takes in water.

Absolutely frightening. according
to users. is an over-fertilized plant. It
reportedly emits an unsettling high-
pitched scream. a horrible noise that
has caused many gardeners to try to
anesthetire their shrubs before ever
fertilizing them again.
