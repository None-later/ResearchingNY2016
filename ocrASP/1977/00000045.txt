through a;f§ageinatlng littlebook. It was a US. ‘ ‘

Laborbemtrtment publication, whose goal
was to‘ eliminate sex discrimination from. of

_ all things. job titles. The basic idea was to

purge the language of the sufﬁx “-mari"; the
result was a book of ﬁrepersons. forepersons.
cowpersons. and so on for several hundred
pages. But the only remarkable feature of the
book was the name of its author. What divi-
sion ofthe Labor Department do you suppose
is in‘charge of de-sexed job titles? It was the
Division of Manpower Services. Yes. Man-
power. It seems inconsistent.

The point is that government bureaucracies.
like the mass of men (including yours truly).
have a hard time taking seriously the current
fad of revising the language toexorcise from it
the demon Gender. There are certain valid
reasons for their reluctance. The first is that if
English were revised according to the/ad. the
result would, be a language even more
cluttered and confusing than it already is. As
an example. consider the omnipresent motto
that stares us in the face from our sugar
packages. “Let each become all he is capable
of being." it seems innocent enough. But we
are told that it is verboten to use the pronoun
"he" alone: it has become the world's shortest
four-letter word. For a time. the “problem” .
was remedied by substitution ——“he or she" ——
until some feverish imaginations saw a
patriarchal conspiracy in that the "he"
‘preceeded the “she”. Now. the accepted
Newspeak version is “Let each becomeall they
are capable of being.“ Never mind that it
changes from the singular to the plural in mid-
sentence —— that it starts of’ftalking about one
person and ends up talking about a mobcalled
“they”. In an age where it is common for
college graduates to have a fourth-grade or
lower writingability. the quality oftheirgram-
mar is hardly surprising.

Secondly, when we purge the language of
gender. it loses something in translation.
Specifically. "non-sexist" English sounds so
much like Newspeak that it would have
brought a nostalgic tear to George Orwell's
eye. We will no doubt in time be treated to
some Newspeak Shakespeare. Who can forget

' \..,

Brutus' immortalswords to the mob in Julius '

Caesar? “Who here is so base that he or she“
would be'a bondperson? If any. speak; for her
and [or him“ I: have offended." I hope not.<The
much-maligned English language has a certain
grandeur, a certain majesty to it, which is non-
etheless breathtaking even when it echoes
through the musty corridors of centuries. But
it invariably happens that when we tamper
with'Classic English. it ends up about as elo-
quent and moving as computer printout.
Thirdly. Newspeak is discriminatory
against we undistinguished scholars. We are
the ones whojust barely scraped through high

‘ school grammar, laboring under the eagle eyes

of women teachers who were quick on the
draw with their red grading pencils. The rest of
you could not imagine how horriﬁed we were
to see red slash marks drawn through any in-
direct pronouns except "he" and “his”.
Enough of those red marks and you could
forget about college. If you were already in
college. you could ﬁgure on an extended vaca-
tion in Vietnam. We had a hard enough time
learning our grammar the ﬁrst time around:
we are not about to start re-learning it.
I

The government is now trying to legislate
our speech in much the same way as: Prohibi-
tion sought to legislate our morals. Like
Prohibition. it won't work. For if it is certain
that the law cannot change the way people
think —- and it is — neither can it change the
way they talk. So the bureaucrats of the Divi-
sion of Manpower Services (that’name again
—— such a_delicious irony) will go right on talk-
ing about salesmen and policemen andso on.
Private citizens will. too. despite direct orders
from Big Brother. Excuse me. Big Sibling.

In conclusion. consider how mother nature
is always called “she.” The countries to which
we owe our loyalty are all called “she.” Even
the best fruits ofman's labor. his ships. planes,
computers. and nearly everything else. are all
“she.” All I propose. in return for this
matriarcby. is this. That a curious species of
primate. “Homo sapiens.“ who has descended
from the apes and who is not yet far out ofthe
trees; a species no more than a beastly insect
on an infinitestimal speck ofdung. orbiting a
dying star in the glittering expanse. be called
“He”. C‘mon. people ~ that‘s not risking for
much.

For Whom the
Carillon Tolls »

by David Troeger

If you live on the Albany campus, the
Carillon does not toll for thee.

As of the middle of January the esteemed
Alumni carillon. which towers over this cam-
pus and is the photographic center of this
school. is exactly sixty-three minutes off. lfthe
hour approaching is nine o‘clock. and the
Carillon times. I know that in exactly sixty-
three minutes it will be ten o‘clock. I don‘t
know when nine o'clock passes. but i do know
how long off ten o‘clock is.

I am not cynical or pessimistic; I can see a
positive reason for this custodial negligence
Those in charge want to keep as on our toes.
Why get lulled into a state of security by hav-
ing the proper time tolled at the top of the
hour? That‘s too easy. Iiy letting the carillon
toll as itdoesa mental game ofcalculation and
challenge is created.

One ofthe things which drives me up a wall
(such as scratching a blackboard). is a clock
which is grossly inaccurate. Did you ever drive
through a community where there was a clock,
displayed publicly. which was dead? On these
occasions when l have. I've felt as if the com-
munity has given in to some general feeling of
negligence. There is no ﬁner example of
negligence than a timepiece which runs too
flat or'too slow. A timepiece. by its very

' name. is expected to give accurate time.

Otherwise it is useless. It's like a car that
doesn't start. It is worth nothing unless it per-
forms the function it was meant to.

This brings me back to the Alumni carillon.
That phallic beauty is not performingits func-
tion properly. It should be ﬁxed once and for
all. or it should be dismantled and sent to the
garbage heap I myself. favoring the military.
feel like shooting it out of the sky with a
howitzer cannon every time it tolls the hour in-
correctly, Dramatic. huh? Such an event
would have to be ﬁlmed on videotape and
played back in slow motion.

The carillon, however. is no less functional
than other mechanical structures on the
Albany campus. Take for example the foun-
tains on the podium. One of the few
aesthetically pleasing sights on campus. they
usually are not turned on until the ﬁrst or se-
cond week of May. At this time most students
are preparing for ﬁnals and planning their
departure for the summer. Then there was the
year when administratoi‘s didn‘t want to turn
the fountains on at all because of energy
reasons.

Perhaps the negligence exemplified by the
inaccurate carillon is no worse than that which
exists in other areas of this campus.
Negligence is a poor word; oversight might be
a better one. Oversights should not exist in a

school that attempts to maintain the quality

;_ '  buses are rolling

I am writing this letter in response to a letter
in the ASP concerning SA Vice-President
Gary Parker. The members of Central Council

tand why.

I live on, the downtown campus and l was a
bit perturbed about the weekend bus schedule.
I told this to my l‘riend.Michael Lissner. a
member of Central Council. who went with
me to see Gary. We talked at length with him
about the situation and he assured us that a
bus schedule advertisement would soon
appear.

I was a bit skeptical. because I felt he was
trying to appease me. Much to mysurprise.an
advertisement appeared in last Friday‘s edi—
tion of the ASP.

Lately Gary Parker has received quite a bit
‘of criticism. As far as l'm concerned. Gary.
Parker has acted as a responsible student

reporters aren’t
' perfect

To the Editor:

It is with some misgivings that i write to you
concerning _ the article on weather in the
January 2| issue of the ASP. There are several
problems in, the article and some of them in-
volve me. But in spite of the uneasiness. i feel I

the hope that you can improve the journalism
of your paper in the process. _

First, in general the article is good. A good
number of quotes are used and most are ac-
curate. One minor inaccuracy is that Ray-
mond Falconer‘s quote that the jet stream
loop “has steered north tosouth“ should say
that the jet stream has a more pronounced
north-to-south loop in it than is normally the
case. And my quote that “the sea change over
the North Pacific" may have an effect on the
weather should read “sea surface temperature
changes." But as I said. most quotes are ac-
curate.

The major point is that the three people in-
terviewed for the article were identiﬁed as
“Raymond E. Falconer. research associate“.
“Dr. Harry Hamilton. instructor of at-
mospheric sciences.“ and “Professor Hai
Kyo‘u Kim.“ I have no trouble being referred
to as an instructor of atmospheric science
when instructor means that I teach it. Iiut
since the other two gentlemen were identified
by their titles. I feel just a tad insulted by not
being given a title or having it implied that my
title is Instructor. at titlel have never had.lam
not arguing for full use of my title. or for titles
in general. lam sayingthut consistency should
be maintained. if some people are referred to
in an article by their titles. all people should
be; it is the responsibility ol'the reporter to ob-
tain them. In this particular case. a number of
students and others who read the article. and
know me. might come to the conclusion.

 

erroneous I presume. that the treatment af-
lorded me was racist in nature. I assume the
and vitality that makes it a university.

llierc are other points to  made relevant
to this statement.

I. Some well deserving instructors do not
receive tenure, while other: resign due to in-
tense conccrru placed on research and
publishing.

2. One school, the School of Nursing. was
terminated.

3. There is a proposal to shift emphasis to
public policy analysis while the quality ofttn
undergraduate education here remolnt' in
doubt.

What i wrote earlier about the Alumni

’ V ASP would want toavoid generating such im-

are urging him to resign. and I do not unders-' ‘

must draw these matters to your attention in/

pres 'ons. .V A _ .
' A that note is that Dr. Kim is Jai S. Kim.
Hal Kyou Kim is 'his wife: perhaps this error
occurred by reading the directory too fast.

i hope these comments are taken construc-
iively. and that the ASP and its reporters can
learn from them.

“greatest hits”
saved

To the Editor:

I must take issue with the anonymous It'lch
in the January 25 issue ofASP. whose author
was offended by the cover of your “(freon-o
Hits" issue. As I recall. that cover portrayed n
nude woman holding her arms in such it poo»
tion as to preseer a degree of mystery.

In defense of the ASP. it must be said that
the staff obviously did not intend the sun]
cover to degrade women. If they had. then llh.‘
woman on the cover would not have had her
arms placed nearly so strategically.

' Donald ~B’aty

by Mitchel cohen

Donald Baty was one of several hundred
thousand draft resistors and evaders. He has
already served his years in prison. As one of
the more celebrated resistance cases of the
Vietnam War era. Baty obtained a good deal
of community support for his actions.
Professors wrote letters for him to draft of-
ﬁcials. local politicians debated his case,
students and clergy flocked to picket his draft
board in Bayshore. Long Island. and such es-
tablished newspapers as Newsday were forced
to admit that Baty showed courage and made
important points about the nature ofU.S. in-
volvement in Vietnam.

Yet today. as if in fear of being fingered by
the right wing opposition to President Carter's
partial amnesty. these same professors.
politicians. students. clergy. and newspapers
are dcscrting the draft evaders and resistors as
though they‘re something to be ashamed of——
dirty skeletons in the loyal opposition's closet.
with whom they no longer wish to be iden-
tified.

In a time when those who murdered a na-
tion I0.000 miles around the world are known
as heroes. no one wants to speak up for the
cowards. They are the ones who refused to kill
in an undeclared war. those who evaded the
draft. and those who deserted. It has become a
point of law to distinguish between evaders
and deserters. but there really is no difference
between them. Consciousness comes at
different times to different people; the morali-
ty that made it necessary for the soldier to
desert when he realized what was happening is
no less than the morality of the liberal
professor who wrote a letter opposing the war
to his Congressman. In fact. the morality of
the dcscrting soldier may be of a higher-order.
for the sacrifices such an action entails are
much greater.

Amnesty is extremely important to those
who were forced to leave the country. and to

'those who face criminal charges for resisting
the war-machine. It must be extended to
deserters as well as to draft resistors. Those
who see amnesty as a wayto unify the country.
and “put the war behind us". are using sucha
rationale to avoid coming right out and defen-
ding what the Vietnam war—resistors did.

Vietnam war-resistors must be given total
amnesty because what they did was right. and
what the government did was wrong. Those
who refuse to raise the question of amnesty in
this context serve to fuel the right wing. As
long as there are people who believe that US.
intervention in Vietnam was just; as long as
progressive people allow themselves to be
pushed to the defensive on Amnesty because
they refuse to challenge the basic assumptions
of militarism; as long as the real issues un-
derlying why resistors. evaders. and deserters
did what they did are pushed aside. inten-
tionally forgotten. or swept under the rug of
Partial Amnesty: the war will not be put
behind us. for the basic attitudes underlying
the war will remain unresolved.

We neither expect nor desire ticker-tape
parades for resistors coming home. Should we
wait for Richard Nixon to come out of hiding
at San Clemente. put his arms around the
shoulders of a returning desertcr. and. teary-
eyed for the television cameras. proclaim that
the man is courageous? This deserter. who had
most of the nation clamoring behind its presi-
dent for blood. turned his back on his
homeland and refused to kill Vietnamese.Thc
kind ot'guts Don Baty had. once recognized by
so many professors. students. and working
people. seeks no spectacle as proof of public
appreciation. Those who resisted the U.S.
government‘s war on Vietnam seek open arms.
love. and the silent nod that exists inside many
of us saying thank you for your sacrifice.
thank you for upholding the banner of
humanity in the face of tyranny. and thank
you."most of all. for keeping us human.

one of the first‘a'ctions taken :byMSA—presidents'o

years‘has been to dash off a letter4land a ten thousand‘dollar cheek‘*_—-_to r

the law ﬁrm of Rosenblum and Leventhal. retaining their services for the
coming year. “ ‘ . y » . " i' ' ‘

it's one of the most important decisions SA has to make. The SA
latvyers are responsible for springing arrested students from jail as soon

.as possible, handling complaints against landlords, and, in general,

providing legal advice to the students of SUNYA. it’s time that SA
began to regard this decision more seriously.

A survey should be taken. of students who have consulted‘with
Rosenblum and Leventhal. how many have been helped'bHow many
have been satisfied with the degree of effort and cooperation received?
How many have walked out more confused than when they walked in?

Other possibilities should be checked out. There is a reasonable
chance SA can save student money for a change by throwing some
competition against Rosenblum and Leventhal. How about looking

« into using Albany Law interns to handle some of the load? They would
probably welcome the experience. What about other law firms? And if r

the SA lawyers aren’t quite sure that they'll still be around next year.
they might even work a little harder. _

The firm of Rosenblum and Leventhal—as well as any other
candidates for the job—should be checked out first. How does their
record look? What‘s their success rate? What other clients do they
represent?

This last question is most important, to avoid possible conflicts of
interest. When a student brings in a complaint against his landlord. he
shouldn’t be telling his story to the lawyer who represents that landlord.

Together, the students of SUNYA make up a most lucrative account
for any Albany law firm. It’s a buyer's market; SA should take the time
and effort to get its money's worth. ‘
