Divisionlll opponent. the Coast

30-23. Albany had to forfeit their
first three matches at the lib. l26.

well. but was out-pointed 7—4 by Bin-
civenga. Rounding out the day's ac-
,tion. Denn won his second match of
the day with a 3-2 decision.
Dedicated Individual

Coach Garcia pointed out
Gagliardi after the meet. “His record
is outstanding (13-2) and he is a
dedicated individual. both as a
wrestler and as a captain.“ Commen-
ting on the day‘s work Garcia said.
“Our problem is that we don't have
depth. and ltavc had to forfeit the
lighter weightclasses: but ottr team is
competitive. and our strength is in

the middle-weight classes."

Freshman standout Howie Berger
did not participate. “Howie has a
good chance of winning it in the
SUNY Conference Championships.
and his injury will probably keep
him out of action until then." said
Garcia. _

Tomorrow. the grapplers will take
on Fairleigh Dickinson University at
University Gym beginning at 7 pm.

Pups Squeeze Out Victory

by Rich Seligson

The Albany State junior varsity
basketball'team‘s offensive strategy
for winning has failed to change——
that is. play poorly for the majority
of the game. and then in the ﬁnal few
minutes. reach into their bag of
tricks. and somehow squeak out a
victory. Their tnost recent win was
against Union. Friday night at
University Gym as the Pups. on
Mike Maizes' layup with nine
seconds left, defeated their local foe.
63-62.

In the first ten minutes of the
game neither team was able to es-
tablish a clear advantage. as the lead
see-sawod back and forth. With

. 10:28 left in the first half, Union

called a time out, as the squads were
deadlocked at 18. Then, Rick
Mirabito. Union's diminuitive floor
leader, scored on a drivi'n’g layup to
put his team ahead by two. 20-18.
The Pups stormed right back on
forward Darryl Grant‘s tip-in. of
Tony Oliver‘s missed layup. and the
game was tied.

And Albany was not to be
stopped. Helped by the aggressive
rebounding of Gerry Januszewski.
Maizes. and Lynn Pinkston. they
went on a six point scoring spree.
Two baskets by Grant and a layup by
Oliver. provided the offensive
punch. Pinkston was the playmaker
foyAlbany. making some sharp

' passes. especially one where he hit

Grant all alone underneath. for his'

second basket of the streak. By the
time Albnay had cooled off. they
were up 26-20. with 7:45 remaining.

The rest of the half was the scene

‘ofturnovers.as it appeared that both

squads Were playing with strangers.
and not with their teammates. With
:52 left. Union's Paul Jensen hit from
inside to narrow Albany's lead to
three at 36-33. Pinkston then drove
downcourt. and banked one home
for the Pups. to make it 38-33. Un—
ion. though. had the last laugh as
Vinny Smith‘s fastbrcak layup cut
the tnargin back to three.

Albany coach Bill Austin, when
asked for an evaluation of his team‘s
offense for the first twenty minutes.
termed it "horrible". “They don‘t set
any screens; they're afraid to get hit.“
he said. “And when they do set it
(screen). they don‘t use it."

In the first half. Albany‘s center
was not too effective on eitltercnd of
the court. But the second half saw a
revitalized Maizcs. The Pups began
to slow the tempo down. and this
seemed to help him. as he scored the
Pup's first hoop of the half on a tip-
in of Grant's missed shot.

Albany opened up their biggest
lead of the game with “:52 remain-
ing. at 54-47. Guard Rich Woods

departments as part of the effort to

“We are determined to build these

The two programs were snuffed
last year by State'Education Com-
missioner Ewald Nyquist after being

‘reviewed by a special state-wide ex-
amination board. \

’ ‘flf a prog'ram'is good. you keep a
it.“ said Nyquist. “If a program is
bad. you cut it out. That‘s a stan-
dard.“ He said the two Albany
programs were bad.

The major reason for the termina-
tion. according to Fields. was a lack
of published scholars in the

' departments.

in both cases the key deﬁciencies in

. their eyes is in the critical mass of

senior scholars.” said Fields. “This is
a person who is a publishing scholar
of sufﬁcient volume and excellence
to be'considered a nationel'leader in

his ﬁeld. We don't have quite ‘

enough.“

Fields said he has a goal to ﬁll this
void in publishing scholars. Two
other recommendations made by
ﬁelds shortly after the termination
of ihe programs included the ap-
pointment. of nationally known
chairmen and the removal ofjunior
faculty members from the tenure
process.

“When lcame here my ownjudge-
ment was to strengthen those two
departments.“ Fields said.

According to Fields the two
departments were at the level of
“minimally good. They look to me
like they‘ve got some real assets. And
i really don‘t know how to decide
that question ofthe minimally good.
Lwant them at the level of the cer-
tttinly good.“

The rebuilding program has been
in effect for about a year and a half
and might be ready to bear fruit. One
of the goals that Fields recommend-
ed was reachcd when .lohn Gerber
took over as English Department
chairman this year. -

“Gerber has done extremely well
in pulling the English Department
together and making plans for im-
provement.“ said Fields.

According to Gerber. the recruit-
ment effort will be focused on tlreas
of English where the department is
already strong and has “a chance of
being outstanding“. These include
American literature. critical theory
and contemporary literature and
writing.

“We‘re not trying to develop a
large. all-purpose program." said
Gerber. “We don't expect to build a

‘ PotDecritninalization May Pass

by Bryan Holzberg

Marijuana decriminalization
stands a good chance of passing
this year. according to State
legislative spokesmen.

But Republicans. who control the
Senate. are not pushing aCCording
to a spokesman for Warren Ander-
son (R-Binghamton). the Senate
Majority Leader.

Governor Hugh Carey and the
Democratic-controlled Assembly
supported reform measures last
year. but were blocked inthe Senate.
At that time Anderson had come out
against reform of marijuana laws
and as majority leader. was responsi-
ble for its defeat. Democratic
sources said.

Anderson favors “some change
but sees no advantage in pushing for
it.“ said the spokesman. “Reducing
the severity of penalties depends on
the deﬁnition of decriminaiization
and amount of the substance in ques-
tion.“ he added.

“We're very optimistic." said a
spokesman for Assemblyman
Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan.
“We see no reasons the Legislature
can‘t pass reforms this session."

Gottfried has introduced a bill in
the Assembly along with 24 co-
sponsors which would amend the
State Penal Law on marijuana to
read “possession of upto two ounces
of marijuana. or transfer (exchange
for no consideration) is a violation
(legally not a crime. similar to a traf-
ftc violation). punishable by up to
SIOO fine (no jail)."

Transfer of larger quantities or
sales would receive harsher penalties
"ranging from a Class B Mis-
demeanor to a Class E Felony." un-
der the proposed bill.

Present New York State law calls

for tnaximum penalties of seven
years in prison for possession of
more than one-quarter ounce of
marijuana. Passing a joint' to a
friend is now punishable by upto fif-
teen years in prison.

Gottfried has also proposed
decriminalization for cultivation of
marijuana and that people convicted
under the present marijuana laws
"could apply to the court to have the
conviction and sentence re-done un-
der the new law."

“Those are bargaining points.“

Voorhis. “Legislators propose their

for each ofthe three faculty positions
opened, according to Gerber.

_ “We‘ve narrowed the field down
to‘about five people for each posi-
tion." said Gerber. Three prospects
have been invited to the campus. he
said.

When Fields announced his
recommendations to revive the
English doctoral program last
January. it caused a controversy
within the English department. The
key issue was the recruitment of
noted scholars and the subsequent
denial of tenure to junior faculty
members.

Lawrence Rics were ttlso refused

“They've oppressed the people

people with big credentials. The
irony of it is that the quality of the

said.

No Guarantee

"if Anderson stays back and just
looks on. there‘s a good chance. but
no guarantee. for some form of
decriminaliution to pass this year."
said Voorhis.

According to Gottfried's
spokesman. “Last year was the ﬁrst

floor. But many Republican: and
some Democrats pulled out It the

“Anderson did a lot of work last

year it‘s not a political issue.
Prospects are better that the

According to Ries. the morale of
the English department is “tegible.
very poor” and “The place is in a
state of paranoia.“ ,

"A lot of people are beingsacrific-
ed in the name of re-registering the
Ph D..“ said English ‘faculty
members Jeffrey Herman. “The loss
of the PhD. program is not as much
of a loss as the loss of a person like

“There are thousands of people

drains away from the undergraduate
program.“

“We‘ve been given a lot oflip ser-
vice." sadi Bermann. “The ability to
teach is not rewarded. it‘s how many
publications one hits printed that
counts.“

Fields termed the .claim that un-
dergraduate programs were being
sacrificed for the benefit of develop-
ing a graduate program a “phony
issue“.

“It could be an issue if we were

_ careless and appointed scholars who 7

are interested only in graduate '
students and neglect un-
dergradutttcs. That's not our view of
it. We're going to appoint people
who take good care of the students
on whateverthey‘re on.“ said Fields.

Fields said. “In order to sustain
the claim that we're casting off the
undergraduate interests. one has to
offe_r the assumption that a young
person is a better teacher than an
older one and that a person who
doesn‘t publish is a better teacher
than one who does publish. That's
probably untrue.“

According to Gerber. the main
concern is building up the
undergraduate program. “The
