disadvantages espounded by the big

The major area of impact would
be on the enpironrnent, from both a
itarrow and a broad perspective. St

would immediately affect us in o r
environment because returnables
would cut down on the amount of

. litter oncarnpus. People are less like-
ly to toss t bottle inttithe wind than
they are a can. In tlte state of Oregon.
highway beverage container litter
was reduced' by 79'percen't after
enacting legislation reutrned the
state to returnables.

On a broader scale. the produc-
tion of returnables requires less
energy than cans do. Also. sinceeachr
returnable can be used for ten trip.
the overall reduction in energy ex-
penditure would be around 66 per-
cent. This winter‘s energy problems
point out the serious need for a real
commitment to conserve.

Money. of course, is a major con—
sideration. Will returnables cost
you. the consumer. more‘! In
Oregon. after they enacted the retur-
nable lanhe price of a case of soda
decreased about. It! cents. Recent ex;
periences in Vermont have also
shown that the price ot'soda l'orcon-
sumers decreases once disposables
are replaced. The initial cost of con-
version here at SUNYA can be ab
sorbed by‘UAS and if the price of
soda increases. it will not be because
ol~ returnables but due to inﬂation.

Also on a- broader perspective.
returnable bottles will improve New
York State‘s employment situation.

‘ The NYS Senate Task Force report
of I975 estimates that a net increase
of 4.000 jobs- would result from
statewide bottle legislation.

Finally. it‘s a simple matter of
taste. While the price will be the
same for two ounces less of soda. the
quality will be greatly improved by
elimimting the tinny taste.

As for logistical problems with
returnables on campus. Norbert

D'uring the session  the New

have positive impact on the momen-

returnables statewide. Either way,
whether we do it now or wait for it to
become law. we are going to end up
switching to returnables. Why not
now? '
