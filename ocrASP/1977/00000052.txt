local bottling plant. Since current
soda vending personnel and equip-"
ment arejnot sufﬁcient to handle the
incre Nd bottle Volume. at leastone
new itn‘ploye'e and ,one.ti'uck must be
acquired at the expenseofUAS. '. .

. . .Current estimates are that
[because of space limitations] ap-
proximately 900 square feet would
be necessary to adequately handle
full and empty bottles ifan addition
could be built next to_ the. chm-
missary loading dock. lf space must
be constructed at. another .ap-
propriate location. then ap-
proximately i300 square feet will be
necessary to store the entire” inven-
tory of full and empty bottles. . .

' Proposed Space

. . .[such 'a structure] muxt be
constructed at the expense of UAS.
Another requirement of the propos-
ed space is loading dock. access for
tractor-trailer deliveries with per-
sonnel available to receive and ship
the prodttct. 'Io divide the single
deli\er_\' area into several around the
uptown and downtown campuses
uould not be economically or
procedurnlly feasible. . .

. .’ .[Other] considerations regar-
ding bottle returns'arc the number
that will not be returned. what
happens to them, and what will be
the effect on future soda prices.
These. of course. are extremely dif-
ficult to predict. but it similar pro-
jects about twenty—live percent will
not be returned to UAS. In volume
and cost‘ it means approximately
I74.000 bottles at a cost to UAS of
$3.700. . . . . .l‘o date. for six
months ol busine . the net loss in
tlte soda business is approximately
SLMU, I here Is a further indication
that because the SC deposit does not
cover the entire cost of a bottle. the
bottler may increase the cost of the
product to HAS to cover the
losses. . .

. .(lor loss experience on this
campus based on the pilot project
on State Quad begun June 1970 and
continuing through today shows
the following: I't'orn June Jiltrough
September 27. approximately 25 '4‘

/ (0.504 bottles): trom June 3 through
November 24. approximately 28%
(0.080 bottles). If this proves
anything. it shows we're close to the
average. This actual return percen-
tage is contrary to the results of a
survey taken in State Quad last Spr-
ing wherein 9w; of the customers
surveyed said they would return
bottles.

In conclusion. the success of
failure at the project obviously
depends on the customer. Ultimate-
ly. the additional expenses and
operational problems must be
weighed carclully relative to
customer satisfaction. cooperation
and willingness to share the expense
of returnable bottles.

One of my main concerns is how
do wejustily the expenditures for ad-
ditional facilitcs. personnel and
equipment. it after a short period of
time. it becomes necessary to ter-
minate the returnable bottle project.

COMPUTEH'rntP-OFF' I

The congressional Watchdog
Agency, the general accounting of-v

lice. reports that computer'crlrnes -«

are fast becoming oneoflhemoet
lucrative rip-off businesses in
America. _ ‘

At least 400 cases of crime-by-
computer have been discovered in
private industry over the past eight
years in which’ victims have lost' at
least‘5200 million. ‘

One of the strangest cases in-
volved a midwest bank president
who was blackmailed by atelier who
forged access to a computer: The
teller had, retrieved the bank
president‘s! school records, which
showed he had ﬂunked out of
college, and then collected money
from the embarrassed president in
return for keeping the secret.

In anothércase. a disgruntled
employee of a west coast company
wrote a program for its computer
that automatically erased every bill-
ing record six months after the
employee quit. The company no
longer knew who Och it money.
and finally. in desperation. placed an
ad in newspapers begging customers
to come forward voluntarily. The
customers didn‘t, and the company
went bankrupt.

VEAL SQUEAL
Here’s some food for thought for
the next time you order that tender
veal cutlet on the menu. The Animal
l’roteetion Institute reports that an
increasing number ol'animals are be-

lladonna... a7. reeult-oi'bigger ~

. demands for meat. The'ittetitute
.cites, as an example. the case of the
young calves which are slated later to
become your typical veal cutlet.
The institute says that the veal
calves are'often “Weak. anemic and
susceptible to disease" because'the
baby cows are fed a milk-formula
which is iron deﬁcient, a condition
necessary to produce prized pale

According to the institute. the
calves‘ desire for roughage and iron
is so great that they must be im~
mobilized in the stalls. so they can-
not scck iron sources such as nails or
feces. This lack of movement does
produce more tender veal by not
allowing development of muscle
tissues. but it causes tltc calves to
become extremely restless. the in-
stitute says.

To quiet the baby cloves. tnost
veal houses reportedly are kept com-

MY FAIR LADY

' -What's the most popular record

‘- album of the past 20 years? lf‘yotl '

guessed something by the Beatles. or
Elvis. or the Stones or Dylan. you're
completely wrong.

As a matter of fact. according to
Billboard, the music industry trade
publication, the top to L.P.’s
between I956 and I976 do
not include a single rock
album.

The most popular l..P. over the
past 20 years. believe it or not, is "My
Fair Lady." by the original
Broadway cast.

Others in the top to include two
versions of "The Sound of Music,“
“South Pacific.“ “West Side Story."
and even “Sing Along with Mitch."

The highest pop record. according
to Bil/board. is .lohn Denver's
“Greatest Hits.“ in the number ll
spot. The Beatles' best effort was
“Sergeant l’epper“ at number 26;
while the Stones don't appear until
number I44 with "Hot Rocks." As
for Dylan. he doesn‘t even rate in the
top 200.

INDIAN SCOUTS
The US. Customs Service—
which has been using everything

confirm that they are employing at
least l4 lttdian scouts on horseback
in the Southwest whose speciality is
tracking the footprints of smugglers
across the desert.
The all-Indian unit is reportedly

It was just a question of time: ‘A -

is being called the' world's ﬁrst
pocket-sized T.V. set. Sinclair
Rad'ionics of London is out with a
black-and-white “microvision set"
with a tiny, 2-inch screen. The entire

The tiny set. which reportedly can

PORTA-JOHN
Entertainer Johnny Carson has filed
a $1 million damage suit against a
portable toilet maker for namingthe
newest of his products “Here's John—

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

MALE BORDELLO _ - '

com Magazine is reporting that ‘
one of the popular new enterprises.
on the west coast is‘the male
bordello~or a house of prostitution
catering to women. K

The magazine says that the
successful housesmoffering their
customers “the gamut from Latin
lovers to Robert Redfords"-——are'
operating in San Francisco and in
the nearby suburb of Sunnyvale.
California.

The female customers reportedly
range from young college women
who are looking for sex without in-
volvements to suburban housewives.
One male bordello identified as “The
House of Happy Solicitation"
reportedly advertises itself as “The
Sears Roebuck of Male l’rostitu-
tion.“ and charges about $30a trick.

BIZARRE BEE

A series of I’entagon documents——
recently released under the Freedom
of Information Act~~rcveal that the
U.S. Army seriously considered an
array of very bizarre weapons to
control domestic crowds and
demonstrations during the late
1960‘s.‘Thc documents, obtained by
Cliir'agoSun Timur columnist Bob
Greene. talk of using a “mechanical
bee“ or swarms of living insects to
turn back crowds of protesters. The
documents in question were
prepared in [969 bytlte U.S. Army‘s
“Limited War Laboratory" at the
Aberdeen proving ground in New
Mexico.

A flavor of what they contain is
the “mechanical bee.“ Army
researchers suggested that tiny.
remotely-controlled model planes
cottld be mounted with hypodermic
needles and then launched against
specific individuals in a "civil dis-
obedience" situation. The idea was
that the needles would puncture the
selected targets and render selected
demonstrators senseless.
