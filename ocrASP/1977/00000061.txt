Gymnasts Lose Two

by Christine Bellini

Although the individual perfor-
mances were stronger. according to
coach Edith Cobune. the Albany
State Women‘s gymnastics tcamjdst
didn‘t have the craft it takes to mark
up a team victory against the talents
of the Ithaca or Cornell squads this
past weekend.

Coming off their last mcct\with a
defeat. the Albany gymnasts felt that
the lack of practice due to recess hurt
their performances. Surfacing with a
total of l03.85 points (a season high)
to lthaca‘s' l “3.05 on Saturday. the
Danettes proved to themselves what
a week of practice can do.

Julie Acton. finishing as State‘s
best individual performer. took se-
cond place on the uneven bars witha
score of 7.45. Following on the beam
for Albany was Corrine Palms. a
new freshman" recruit. with a second
place score of 7.l0. Both Acton and
Palma add a good deal of strength to
the team. according to Cobane with
their “good. consistent perfor-
mances." ,

All-round performer Mary Ann
Caperno stacked up a total of 26.25
points which placed her third to
ltaca'r all-round high of 27.8 points.

Sunday‘s meet agairut Cornell
spread the gap between victory and
defeat even further. Flanked with a
“much improved team" according to
Cobane. the Cornell gymnasts swept
the floor with a total of l29.20
points. taking Albany‘s I04.05 point

total with them. '

Capcrna scored exceptionally.
high on the. vaulting event but sur~
faced fourth out often competitors
with an Albany high of 7.85 point.
()n the floor she performed Albany's
best routine (7.65 points) which pitte-
ed her fifth to the Cornell entries.

Winding up the meet. Acton
scored a 7.3 on the uncvcns for the
third place position. followed by
Palm: in fourth with 6.85 points.

Fairleigh Dickinson Hands Grapplers Fourteenth Loss

by Eddie Emerman

The Albany State wrestling squad
lost its fogrteenth match of the
season. Ill-l3. to Fairleigh Dickin-
son University at University Gym
Wednesday night.

The Danes were up against a
tough Division I team with a 4-5
record. However. their record is not
indicative of their play. according to
F.D.U. coach B‘oh Metz. “We‘ve
been plagued with injuries all year

and that has hurt us.”

The Danes haVe had their share of
injuries this year. also. Once again
they had’to forfeit the no pound
match at freshman Howie Berger

"'wautill out nursing an injury.

Albany started the night offatrong
as they won their f -' a three matches

handily. Opening at l34. Dave
Rosenberg beat John Kinny l2-3.

Captain Vick Gagliardi (l42) im-
proved his record to lit-2 as be
trounced Dick Metz l2-0. Then Rick
Porter gave the Dance a 13-6 lead
when he beat Mike Gallo ll-l in the
ISO class.

Danes Go Downhill

From here on. however. the Danes
got off the winning track and stayed
off for the rest of the match. F.D.U.‘a
upper weight division is its strength.
according to Meta. and his team
showed why. Beginning at I58.
Albany's Mike Williamson was
defeated 8-2 by Al Matos.

Then came a costly, loos ll‘l67 for
the Danes. Not onlydid they loecthe
match. but they also lost their

wrestler. Jeff Aronowitl. He injured
his ankle and was forced to default.
The extent of the injury was not im-
mediately known.

F.D.U. won the next three
matches to close out the scoring. Co-
captain Bob Scay defeated Albany's
Chris Covas I24 while Ron Train
and cocaptain Bruce Klein pinned
their Albany opponents. Ted Davis
and Joe Dean. respectively. For the
two cocaptaina the victories were
their tenth against no losses for the
season. ‘

Afterwards. Albany's head coach.
Joe Garcia. summed up the match:
“it was a matchup of our strength
against their weakness and vice-
versa. We made a few mistakes and
we just can't afford that."

This was the fourthstraight match
Berger had to sit out because of in-
jury. Before the match. he discussed
his ﬁrst year of college wrestling.
“I‘m not particularly pleased with
my wrestling this year. in high
school I was wrestling at I l9 pounds
and here i was wrestling IJ'I
pounders and everyone is stronger.

Also the competition is harder and ,

l'm not in the best shape."
th Home Appearance
Berger hopes to be in action

tomorrow when the Danes face, "
Kings Point and Central Connee- .
ticut. The matches will be held in the :
University Gym beginning at 2 pm. i

A tentative contractual agreement
was reached yesterday between New
York State and the union represen-
ting 15.000 academic and
professional SUNY employees

spokesperson Evelyn Hartman.

The United University
Professions must now approve the
agreement. which calls for a two-step
pay raise over the next two years.

The ﬁrst step is a percentage in-
crease on the employee's basic un-

from three to five and a half per cent.

Danes Upset Siena In Finale

by Mike Plekarski

it was like a fairytale. Only this
one was true. Yes. you can shout it
from the towers. proclaim it from the
ﬁelds. herald it unto the very ends of
the kingdom. The giant has been
slain and the hero rcturneth
triumphantly.

Althouglt the ﬁnal chapter of the
story might seem too incredible even
for the most impressionable child.
nevertheless. it is true. The mighty
Siena lndians (who deigned to make
this the final game of the areas‘ most
famous rivalry) were defeated; nay.
humbled; by their lowly Division III
cousins. Because when. the ﬁnal
trumpet had sounded Thursday
night. the Albany Great Danes had
climbed the beanstalk and alighted
with a dramatic 62-49 slaying of the
Siena giant in its own backyard.

“We did itl We did it!" screamed
Albany's backcourt a¢e Gary Trevett

in the victorious iockerroom. “i love
it." said the quiet man. Albany‘s
soph center Barry Cavanaugh. “I
can't believe it!" And the master-
mind behind thc upset. Dane coach
Doctor Dick Sauers. said only one
thing to his players as he took the
victory swig from a secretly produc-
ed bottle of vodka. “Nastrovyu!”
Which means "to your health“ in the
language of the fairy tale.

it had to be a great personal
triumph for Sauers after three years
of frustration at the hands ofthe in-
-dians. Although Sicnu was only l5-
to versus Saucrs' Danes before
Thursday. they had won the last four
confrontations in a row. But this

1' time. the Dane coach was ready as he

had his scouting reports given to his
players well in advance.

"it was the way Doc told me to
play [Wayne] Meyer.“ said Trevett
afterward. “i listened to what he said

and it [guarding him] was easy."
Meyer. who leads Sicna with [5.3
points per game average. was held to
just six points. Sauers scouted all of
Sicna's players and explained their
movements beforehand to the
Danes. according to Trevett. “Doe
won it for us." he said. '
