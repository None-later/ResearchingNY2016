Valley Waste
NYS Concern?

by Jim Reilly

; ‘ New York State may be responsi-

' ble\l'or 600.000 gallons of highly
radioactive nuclear waste. as Well as
the three-quarter billion dollar tab
for reprocessing low level waste
currently stored at a West Valley
reprocessing plant.

The state‘s liability stems from an
agreement made between the state's
Atomic Research and Development
Authority and Nuclear Fuel Services
lne.. a subsidiary of (ietty Oil. con-
tracted to build and operate the
reprocessing facility back/in I963.
according to the report.
‘ The report. written by Paul Hud-
son. called that agreement “a pot-
pourri of bad estimates. leaky
provisions. and gaping loopholes".
one of which. a "quick turnover op-
tion". enabled NFS to dump all
responsibility for the plant and waste
into the state lap last April.

“As SUNY students are led down
the path of budget cuts and tuition
hikes by legislators under the
auspices of {fiscal restraint‘. here the
state has contracted into the largest
corporate bailout in U.S. history.
said Chairman of NYl’IRG's
SUNYA branch Kevin Kovacs.

In his report. Hudson presents
several courses of action. The state.
together with the New York State
Energy Research and Development

’ Authority (ARDA‘s successor). can
assume full liability and bail out
NFS. (ietty Oil. and the nuclear in-
dustry. and perhaps hope for federal
aid. in this case. the financial burden
will fail on the taxpayers. according
to the report. Another alternative
would be to attempt to force (ietty
Oil to assume financial responsibili-
ty for their subsidiary through court
action.

Hudiron said last Monday that
NYl’lR(i is working through
NYSERDA on this possibility. and
hopes to press (ictty Oil for some
kind of settlement. lludson also said
that NYl’IRG is in the process of
drafting legislation to place a tax on
all utilities producing nuclear waste.
to provide for treatment and dis-
posal of this waste.

Public officials who used to like to
keep their meetings private may now
plausible claim that if the public is
not informed about what isgoing on.
it is the fault ol'thc 'vews cdia and
the public itself. rather than of oi'-.
l'icialdom. ‘

Cynics might point to this situa-
tion as one more example of ho\v'il-.
lusory "reform" often is r- as
evidence that the more things
change. the more they remain the
same. and that what is billed as im-
portant structural reform often
results in little or no substantive
change. '

Fol/wring are excerpts from an nteerl’ll‘ Willi SA
I President Steve Di Mel) and SA Vice President Gory

Parker on the WSUA talkshow "Straightlim-“. Dah

Gaines hosted the program which was aired Feb. 6.

 

 

 

 

Gaines: Steve. when you were run-
ning for president of Student
Association. you had an idea. i
assume. of What the job would be
like. How would you compare what
it actually is to what you thought it
would he'!

Diillco: To bc‘truthl'ul. when I ran
i really did not have a clear concep-
tion of what the duties and respon-
sibilities would be exactly or any
clear-cut notion of what we Wanted
to do once we assumed office.
Gaines: Well. What did you have?
DiMco: Wcll. more or less. a vague
impression of what projects and a
certain direction we would likcto go.
but I definitely had a philosophy of
how I wanted to run that office as far
as. in comparison to. my
predecessors did. i conceived my
role as more of a manager and less of
a political person than my
predecessors.

Gal/mt: When you say “less of a
political person“. what was political
about your predecessors that you

 

didn‘t likc'l‘

DiML-o: Well. lirst of all. lam very
thankful for my predecessors
because they made myjob far more
easier. For tliem. it was necessaryto
go out and light for student rights;to
go out into the administration and
prove a point'. that students are
valuable to the university and they
should have input in the decision
making process. I feel that when
elected. it was time to take that
power attd input that we had achiev-
cd over those past years and put it to
use. and I believe that it was time to
tone down the role of student
radicalism. student power. and
become part ol'thc university. part of
the decision-making process. And
that‘s one role that I think I have ac-
complished.

Accomplishments

Gaines: What would you call your

favorite accomplishments?

DiMm: That Would he student
dwellings. that is my favorite ac-
complislunent.

Gaines: (iary. when you were run-
ning for SA Vice President last year.
there Were some things you thought
you would be doing and somethings
you didn't think you would be doing
when you became Vice President
and you were doing some things and
you weren‘t doing other things. How
did they compare“!

Par/tar: I thought there would be a
better relationship between the of-
fice of president and the office of vice
president. During the summer. I had
some fairly high hopes and things
were working out fairly Well. Once
Sept. rolled around. though. things
changed a little bit and as the months
went on I think the relationship
between Steve and | deteriorated.
That is depressing.

Gaines: Is there anything else that
compares to that in importance in
your mind?

Parker: That is probably one ol‘thc
most important things in my mind.
that is. the relationship between the
two offices. because without a well-

 

grcased. well-Working relutionship.l
don't think we have been working as
well as We should have been.
Gaines: Did you think about what
it would be like to work withGary'.’
DiMeo: Initially. when (iaryand i
first sat down and talked. there
didn‘t seem to he too many problems
at all.

SA Running Smoothly
Gaines: (iary. you mentioned
things \vcrc okay during the summer.
What made you think that SA was, ‘
running smoothly during the
summer?
l’rrrkr'r: Well. our meetings with
the administration. administrators.
ottr talks among ourselves . . . the
goals that we set.

Gaines: Do you agree with Steve's
philosophy about the fact that the
last student administration did the
fighting and that this one can be
friendly because now administrators
respect student powcr'.’

Parker: No. I don't believe that ad-
ministrators respect student power. I

   
      
 
  
    
    
    
    
   

think that administrators are just
very keen in pulling the Wool over
students' eyes." i think that they have
ways of doing things and talking to
people and talking to students and
they know that there is a lack ofcon-
tinuity among the students and stu-

dent government. I think that they -

definitely take this and use it tothcir
advantage. ‘
Gaines: Can you name an issue
where this year the administrators
pulled the wool. as you say. over the
eyes of student administrators?
Parker: I think there is one issue
right now at present where they are
attempting to do that and I think it is
the student recreation center. and
just the way that student recreation
center meetings are being run and
the organization of the committee
and the duties that everyone was tak-
ing on. It is definitely an ad-
ministrative project.
(irritant: Steve. do you agree with
that?
