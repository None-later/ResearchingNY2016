ENTERIE 2241 '

President ldi Arniri of Uganda has
told a Chicago newspaper that he
would like to become King of the
«United States. Chicago'Sun Times
columnist Bob Greene reports he
was sitting around the city room last
Tuesday. and decided to call up ldi
Amin in Uganda for an‘interview. To
Greene‘s surprise, Amin came onthe'
line. .

During the telephone chat, Amin
told Greene that. although he is in-
terested in becoming King — of
Scotland, he also would like to rule
the U.S. Said the.Ugandanleader:“l
would like to be King of the United
States. If the American people want
me. I will come there and be king.”
Amin reported that he is a great ad-
mirer of Jimmy Carter. He is quoted
as telling Greene: “I love Jimmy
Carter very much. He is a very great
revolutionary . . .“ The Ugandan
president also revealed that he has
abandoned his plans to build a statue
in Uganda saluting Adolph Hitler.
According to Amin. the statue idea
was scrapped after it was learned
that “Hitler was in favor of dis-
crimination against black people.“

Greene says anyone interested in
chatting with Amin can reach him at
Entcbbc 224i.

DOORMATS

Do you cringe when you hear your
cat‘s pawstcps'.’ Do you let your boss
and friends walk over you? If so.
then the time is right for you tojoin
"Doormats." an organization for
people who are glad to becowards.

Doormats, which stands for
“Dependent Organization of Really
Meek and Timid Souls." has been
founded by J. Upton Dickson.
whose motto is “The meek shall in-
herit the earth . . . if that‘s okay
with everybody." The Doormats‘ of-
ﬁcial symbol is a yellowtraffic light.

Dickson says his Doormats
organization is out to counteract at-
titudes that the bullies of the world
are in control. currently perpetrated
by such books as Winning Through
Intimidation. Dickson says he will
soon be out with his own book. titled
Cmver Power. Cower Power con-
tains sections on such things as "giv-

ercises guaranteed to make you

CHAIN GANG

A leader of the Yippies has been
charged with felonioust assaulting
police ofﬁcers in Washington in con-
nection wit a demonstration over
the weekend at the White House.

Youth international party
organizer Ben Masel has been releas-
ed on $500 bail after an incident at
the federal courthouse on Monday.
The affair began Saturday when
eight yippies — calling themselves
the “White House Chain Gang" —
chained themselves to the White
House fence as a protest against
parts of Carter's amnesty program
and against U.S. aid to foreign
military governments. Park policc'
used bolt cutters to breakthe chains.

[arrested the yippies on charges of

demonstrating without a permit and
later released them.

On Monday, however. Masel and
the others arrived at the courthouse
to reclaim their chains; police claim
that Masel assaulted ofﬁcers when'
all of the material was not returned.
Masel. if convicted on the assault
charges. faces a possible l0 years in
prison.

EDUCATION COSTS

If you think the cost of on educs- '
tion is high now. just wait for
another Iii years. The Oakland
Financial Group Incorporated of
Virginia recently tabulated how
much money parents will need to
send their children to college in IS
years.

The group calculated that today it
costs an average of SI7.000toattend
a tax supported school for four
years. and $30,000 to go to a private
school for the same period of time.
Using a six percent inflation rate. the

It may be who you're kissing —
and not all those sweets you're eating
— that's causing your tooth decay
problems.

Doctor

Paul Keyes of The

ﬁrm estimates that in 18 years. the /

cost of going to a state university for

four years will havejumped to more \

than $47,000. If you want to send
your kid to private school. the firm
says. you can plan on hiking that es-
timate to at least $82,000 annually.

LIGHTING THE WAY

The National Taxpayers Union
reports that some government scien-
tists want to put artificial suns and
moons into orbit in order to il-
luminate parts of the Earth at night.
These artiﬁcial suns and moons
would reportedly permit night-time
harvesting. light up polar regions
that remain dark most of the year.
and spotlight high-crime areas 24
hours a day. The bogus suns are be-
ing developed by NASA and The
Rockwell Corporation. According
to the taxpayers union. the initial
cost of the fake moon project would
total $540 million.

KEEPING TABS

Anyone who sends five dollars to
the government printing office can
now obtain a list ofthe lists ofpeople
the federal government keeps tabs
on. The lists -— 6600 ofthem ——- are
now contained in a 750-page book
published by The General Accoun-
ting Ofﬁce. called Protecting Your
Right to Privacy. According to the
book. the champion list-maker of
them all is the Department of

s ' l I I ' I
National Institute of Dental
Research says a series of new studies
has found that micro-organisms
causing gum diseases are passed
along among friends and family
members. Keyes lists the diseases as
the number one cause of tooth
decay. According to the doctor. the
traditional warnings about brushing
your teeth regularly and avoiding
sweets may not be as important as
dentists once thought. Instead. den-
tists might learn'more by knowing
who your boy or girl friends are.

TERSE VERSE
Paul McCartney sounded a bit
like Muhammad Ali recently when
asked in London for the umpteenth
time if the Beatles would ever re-
unite. Paul responded in verse: "The
Beatles split in '69; and since then

..--.

they've been doing ﬁne; and if you
ask that question once more; I think
I‘ll have to break your jaw."
