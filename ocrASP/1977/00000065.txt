books. The laws vary greatly and none grants
an absolute right . to inspect every record.
However, in all but two states. the presump-
tion is that public records are open unless
specificallyexempted from the FOI Law.
New York State is one of the two states with
an opposite presumption. In New York all

 

   
 
  

records are presumed to be secret unless ‘

speciﬁcally stated to be open. This backward
approach has profound consequences for
citizen activists anxious to participate in
government decision-making or for those in-
terested in ﬁnding out what government
decisions were made. On amore philosophical
level this reverse approach is revealing of the
mind-set of the politicians who drafted and

passed the bill overthe objections of many ‘
citizen groups. _
"Most’ FOI ‘ LaWs exempt from public

scrutiny certain records such as those that
would infringe on personal privacy, reveal
trade secrets, or compromise necessary

collective bargaining agreements. over the
years. at least on the federal level. these exemp-
tionshave been reﬁtted and clariﬁed by the
courts. At the national level and in all states
that'have a positive approach. the burden to
deny acitizen access to a public record must be
borne by public officials. In New York State it
is up to the citizen to prove that the record

sought fits into one of the speciﬁc categories to
which the law grants aceess. In other words,
the burden is reversed. In New York it is the
citizen's responsibility.

No knowledge of law is necessary to unders-
tand how much less inclusive and more
troublesomegthe New York Fol Law is. It is
far more difﬁcult to list categories that' are
open than simply to state everything is open

- The Oil crisis

by David Troeger

By all accounts and news releases, this
winter has. thus far. been the harshest in many
a year. The most practical way of combating
the subsequent fuel shonages‘ is to conserve
and not waste what we have. In times of crisis
you make do the best. you can with the
materials on hand.

One shudders to think. however. how much
oil has been wasted before reaching reﬁneries.
I speak of the recent number of misadventures

'with oil tankers which have either spilled their

cargo as the Argo Men-haul did. or been total-
ly lost and presumably sunk as in the case of
the Grand Zenith. If the number of incidents
totalled two it wouldn‘t be that bad. But the
ships involved number well over a dozen. all
occurring in rapid succession within the last
few weeks.

What these tanker incidents point out. as
has been mentioned elsewhere. is the in-
creasing demand for imported oil by the Uti-
ited States. Unfortunately. tankers are
worthless if millions of gallons of oil cargo
flow out to sea before reaching port. Former
head of the Environmental Protection Agen-

Carter

by Ed Moser

Jerry Brown is taking Jimmy Carter to
court. The eccentric Governor of California is
attempting to set a new legal precedent by so-
ing the President of the United States for“per-
sonality plagiarism." Brown says Carter has.
in effect. stolen his persons by projecting a
public image of frugality.

Brown is incensed at a series of actions. on
the part of Carter. which he says mimic his
own career as California's governor. He cites

.Carter‘s decision to walk to the White House
after the inauguration. in place of the
customary automobile ride, as an imitation of
Brown‘s spare life-style. Similarly. he derides
Carter's exhortations that Cabinet members
should cease riding in expensive limousines.
and that Americans should turn their ther-
mostats down to 65 degrees. “He could at least
wear Irish wool." scoffed Brown. when asked
to comment on the sweater Carter has been
sporting lately.

Brown was the first "liberal" Democratic
governor to receive national attention when he
admitted the limits of governmental action
and called forcuts in public spending. Famous

cy. Russell Train. said that this rash of oil
tanker incidents was proof of our need for
offshore drilling on the Continental Shelf
along the Eastern seaboard. This might end
importation of oil via oil tankers. but I wonder
if Mr. Train has realized that there is the
possibility of oil spillsemanating from;oil rigs.
If given the choice between all tankers and oil
rigs I prefer oil tankers. At least if something
unfortunate happens we can blame someone
else. like the Liberians, who allow ships to sail
under their flag with extremely lax re-
quirements. If we build our own rigs offshore.
and a spill occurs. We would look pretty dartin-
ed foolish. We‘d have only ourselves to blame
for consciously deciding to foul our nest.
Oil tankers and oil rigs are only short term
solutions to a long term energy problem. Dc-
mand continues to increase while supply
dwindlcs. We may survive this by pulling in
our belts. but what about next winter. and the
winter after that. and the winter after that?
'Our first line of defense, as I stated earlier.
must be conservation—to get more mileage
out of the fuel we have on hand. The second
line of defense must rest with development of

in Court

for his hatred of waste. Brown once signed a
low effectively limiting the amount ofwatcrtt
toilet bowl could pass with each flush. Always
one to practice what he preaches. Brown refus~
ed. upon hiselectiontts governor, to move into
the sumptuous gubernatorial palace built by
Ronald Reagan. He chose to dwell in a low
rent hotel room. instead.

President Carter has refused to comment on
the Governor‘s charges. However, the
President‘s brother. Billy Carter. admits there
may be some truth in what Brown has to say.

“Jimmy got the hell scored out of him last
summer. when Brown won all those primaries
late in the campaign." said Bill Carter. as he
downed a Rheingold. “Jimmy realized the
appeal Brown's populist style had, and decid-
ed to make it his own. Burp."

Theodore White, the noted political com-
mentator. feels that Carter‘s mimicry is a way
of safeguarding his political future. In a
Manhattan hotel suite. while working on his
book The Making of the President. [984. the
author had these comments on Carter:

Kennedy ran against Democratic incumbent

'- The. common sense. feeling that the law is
bad is reinforced by three years practical ex-

perience working'with it.',CompIaints from -
'news reporters. investigators. and average

their resistance takes perseverance and a
strength that could best be eitpcnded in other
pursuits. Why should citizen taxpayers~be
forced to struggle to view records that their

The prospects for reform are not very~
bright. The Republican-led State Senate
favors- change. Last year the Senate passed a
weak bill. but one nevertheless that switched
the presumption and would have brought
about some reform. The bill died in the
Democratic Assembly. Early soundings in-
dicate that the same fate may await other FOI
reform bi_lls coming up this year. t

new and unique sources of energy. Oil. instead
of being one of the primary sources of fuel. will
have to ﬁnd itself on a level of equality with
other alternatives. .7 ‘

The usage of a most promising and in-
novative energy source is taking place on this
campus at the new Alumni House. The whole
side of the Alumni House roof , facing the cam-
pus, contains copper tubing capable of con-
verting the rays of the sun into energy for the
purpose of heating water. If homes had similar
devices (cheaper in cost) on their rooftops as
do-the homes in Israel. considerable energy
could be saved as compared to the amount of
energy now used for the task of heating water.
It has always struck me that, except perhaps
for the wind. the sun is the cleanest energy
source with the greatest universal access. No
one company can corner the market on the sun
as a commodity. or its distribution for that
matter. So why should any one company
desire to push for the development of solar
energy?

This ,wintcr‘s energy problems. including
the numerous oil tanker incidents. serve to re-
mind us that in spite of our technological
mastery We are still, at times, subject to the
whims of certain forces which are beyond our
control. It is a humble thought as we all slip
into our long johns and wonder if spring will
ever come.

Lyndon Johnson in the I968 primaries.
Kennedy, like Brown. was a young. fresh, new
politician-type. He fears Brown will repeat
Kennedy's performance in I980." Puffing onu
pipe in his plush hotel room, White waxed
philosophical.

“So often the turn of events,
fate itself, V make a notable man
great. For years. Brown urged that belts be
tightened and warned that America was
heading into an era of scarcity. Look at the
natural gas shortage of the past few Weeks. the
drought out West. the dwindling supplies of
oil. Brown is a tnodern dtty doomsayer whose
prophecies have come true. If Carter Wants to
stay in power for eight yours he‘s goingto have
to steal some of Brown‘s thunder. and he has."

Brown is obviously aware. and afraid. that
Carter has been upstuging him politically. He
has reacted by being more of an ascetic than
usual. Recently he spent the night in a ghetto
bedroom. “just to see whatit feels like," ex-
plained the free-spirited former Jesuit
seminurinn. (Critics point out that with

budgets for social programs plummeting.

demonstrating their "concern" for the poor

Seven

by Scott-Slain

Many are the times I sit in front of the old
electronic pacifier, bleary-eyed at one o'clock
a.m.. watching StaryTrek reruns. No doubt,
millions of otherwise sensible people do the
same. Why do we go on risking our health,
domestic peace. jobs and schoolwork, even
our mental well-being. by eschewing a good
night’s sleep in favor of Star Trek? It deﬁesex-
planation. V

It can't be that we just want to see how the
episode ends. Somehow, you just know that
before the hour is up the Klingons will beat a
hasty retreat, the dilithium supply will be
replenished. the planet will be saved. and so
on.

What's more. any alert “Trek Freak" can
detect a common pattern in all the episodes.
It's a safe bet that the whole thing will kick off
with Kirk making an entry in his log. Then in
rapid succession. Uhura will say. “I've tried all
channels. Sir." Spock will say. “Fascinating.”
An alien-will say. "I will give you ten of your
minutes before destroying your ship.“ Sulu
will say. “The shields won't hold much
longer.“ Scotty will say. “Don't worry. my
engines will pull us through." McCoy will
make a derogatory remark about Spock‘s
ears. and it all ends with Kirk saying, “Take us
out of orbit. Sulu. Ahead Warp One."

This is not worth losing sleep_ over.

on Star Trek while you‘re dead tothe World.

The other day Kirk said to me: “You're work-
ing too hard, Spock. Relax. Have some fun.“
How. I asked? He laughed. “Pop open a beer
and wait for your next seven-year cycle to roll
around." Very funny.

Well, I‘ll show him. I happento know Nurse

overdue for promotion to Captain. With my

title: “Spock. His mission — to logically go

“Mr. Spock?“

“Yea. Uhura. What is it?"

“I said we're approaching the planet. Sir.“

“Uh. right. You better call the Captain."

“Bridge to Captain. come in please. Bridge

“Spock hcrc. Captain. Please come to the

hustin buttoning up his uniform. “Spock. this
better be good!“

“Nice to see you back on your feet. (‘up-
tuin." said Spock. “It‘s about time for us to
explore strange new worlds and I huve located
a planet that seems strange enough to suit our
purpose. There are other strange planets in
this system, but this one is the strongest."

“What‘s so strange about this one?"

“Sir. this planet is square."

“Good enough. Hello there. Dr. McCoy."

"Nice to see you up and around. Captain.“
suid McCoy.

“Spock. you are u pointy—cured mental
midget.“

“It would seem logicul to assume. Doctot.
that you are paralyzed from the neck up." stud
Spock.

“We'll proceed to the planet." continued
Kirk. “In the meantime. you with the ears. out
of my chairl I don't need no pointy-cured
Vulcnu to screw up my ship.“

“Certainly not, Sir. You can do that by
yourself." said Spock.

"Damn right I can. Standard orbit. Sulu."

A little later. Kirk, Spock. and McCoy

 

' materialize on the planet’s surface.
' “I‘m beginning to wonder if there's in-

“Stick it in'your parliaments Kirk.
“Ah, there’s a humanoid now.“ I
“Welcome to our planet,” began the
humanoid. “I am President Blatnik.”
“Save it. crumb," said Kirk. “l'm madder
than hell at you and your whole planet.“
“Have I done something to offend?” asked
Blatnik. ‘ -
“Don't play innocent with me. Blatnik.
When the Federation had its last war with the
Klingons. you never lifted a ﬁnger to help us.
You deserted us in;our hour of need."
“You speak strangely. friend." said Blatnik.
“What is a ‘war‘?"
Kirk was genuinely surprised. “I say. Spock,

without the happy privilege offightinga war.

Sometime later. Kirk. McCoy. and Spock
are back aboard the ship. *Let's warp out of
here. Sulu," Kirk said. “Y'kn'ow. Spock.every
planet should aspire to another Earth—to
pull themselves up by their bootstraps through
hard work. like we did. That's why I'm glad I
straightened out that backwards planet."
‘ “Captain. when you say that. ldon‘t believe
my ears.” said Spock. I
“Spock. I don't believe your ears either,”
said McCoy. -
“Doctor, Why don't you just boldly go
where no man has gone before?” said Spock.

To the Editor:

While taking a quick nap in the library this
afternoon my domain was entered and pillag-
ed. My ASPwas ripped off. This may seem to
you a minor matter. but to me it is symp-
tomatic of many evils in our society. States

their shores. lclaim permanent. or temporary.
jurisdiction over movable property up to two

’ feet from my body. My ASP was resting
peacefully just two inches from my head.

amnesty?

To the Editor:

I am writing in response to a recent article in
the ASPentitled “Hello. Donald Buty," which
was concerned With those men who resisted
the draft.

I am in full accord with the author when he
states that the Vietnam War was wrong. but
the individuals who resisted induction were
also wrong. I am not a flag-waving American
who thinks the U nitcd States can do no wrong.
This country would not be its great as it is to-
day. however. if not for its ubilitylo muster an
army.

If you believe that draft resistors should be
pardoned. tell me what will happen next time
we need a draft. All young men will run to
Canada and return when everything is over —
without a penalty. If the people decided not to
serve at all. the dreamers out there might
say “great. no more wars." They are just
dreamers. What they must realize is that wars
are something dreams cun't stop. Tell me
how you can consider it druft resistor anything
but a coward. If he wants to leave the country.
and new." rel urn. that is his decision. To
return his freedom and citizenship. after he
has allowed others to do thcjob that his coun-
try ttsked him to do. seems ludicrous.

The idcu that this amnesty should also be
extended to desertcrs is mind boggling.
Dcserters are not only guilty ol'dcserting their
fellow soldiers but itft: ulso guilty of deserting
their country in u titne of need.

what aboUt ,

The author thanks the returning draft‘
resistors for their sacrifice. This has to be the
greatest injustice to mankind. What can one
say to those that gave the ultimate sacrifice —
their life? What are you going to say to the
mother that sacrificed her son? You might say
this argument is outdated. but can you give
me an answer? V

The men that resisted the draft madendeci-
sion that they should stick with. Other men
made the decision to fight. and are now lying
in Arlington Cemetery. At least they stuck to
their decision.

in reference to
your letter . . .

To the Editor:

It is most unfortunate that Mark Greenstein
chose to verbally assault Assistant Professor
Hamilton in his reply: the fault lies entirely
with Mr. Greenstein. Ignorance is no excuse
for his slight to Mr. Hamilton. A plea ofpure
stupidity seems more applicable. Mr. Greens-
tein chose to construe Mr. Hamilton‘s correc-
tion as an accusation of racism. It plainly was
not that. It was just an attempt to clarify our
too often misused language and sometimes
misguided press. Worse than Mr. Grecnstein's
misunderstanding was the fact that he resorted

high voltage in the bathtub—butthat’s {or them to decide: . - 

A Spring I975 referendum assured NYPIRG‘ funding for only two.
years, a term which will end in April. NYPIRG leaders are claiming that
if a new referendum is not put before the studentsythe organization‘inay v
I be faced with elimination. Student government leaders are saying that
maybe that’s not such a bad idea. SA executives and Council members
are questioning the value of NYPIRG to SUNYA students. They are
questioning the relevance of NYPIRG to the University as a whole.

All this questioning heralds the possibility that Council will vote
down N YPIRG‘s bid for the referendum when it comes up on Feb. 16. If
this occurs, NYPIRG has little chance of surviving. — -

Council members argue that NYPIRG could conceivably exist
Without the referendum-through funding from the .SA budget.
However, this amount would never equal the allotment prescribed by
the ‘referendum——four dollars per year per student.

NYPIRG is different from most student groups. Though student run
and student organized, its concerns are not usually directly connected
with SUNYA, but rather with state-Wide consumer advocacy and lob-

 

'bying activities in the legislature. The thrust of NYPIRG's work is not

aimed at the betterment of SUNYA life per se. but at the betterment of
ltfe in general. Certainly it is no more irrelevant than many of the groups
SA chooses to bless.

Though Council functions under the guise of representing students,
distance from constituents makes direct representation virtually im-
possible.

Because NYPIRG is unlike other SA groups, the question of its fun-
ding should be put to a student vote. In depriving students of the power
to decide whether or not they can allocate an additional four dollars of .
their tax money in the case of an unusual request—such as NY PIRG‘s—
Council is overstepping its bounds.

Instead of quibbling about whether there should be a referendum,
Council should carefully outline the arguments for and against N YP-
IRG, research the organization’s- record over the past two years, and
present all the information to the voting students.

Educate the student body, but don’t make the decision for them. After
all, it’s their four bucks.

 

to mud-slinging and name-calling. This is
childishncss on the part of Mr. Grecnstein. If
not for his well substantiated cries of ig-
norance. the content of the letter might have
given credence to those people labeling Mr.
(ircenstcin as u bigot.

Mr. Grcenstcin says: “I was unaware ofsuch
strict bureaucratic distinctions in the defini—
tion of 'instructor‘." This is a cheap way to dis-
miss a man‘s title. If it man earns il title. he
deserves proper recognition. Asst. Prof.
Hamilton is not blowing the issue out of
proportion. as Mr. Greenstein asserts. He is
merely putting things in their respective pinces
— something Mr. Greenstein refuses to
acknowledge.

Perhaps. Mr. Greenstein‘s refusal to
acknowledge the consequences of his error is
the result of his "unstable" character. Maybe
he‘s been watching too much Archie Bunker.
Great logic . . . right Mark?
