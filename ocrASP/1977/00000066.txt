ODE TO JEH.
A cohort from MUCC and now Albany,
Has always been trustworthy, kind and
zany.

Never call this girl a take,
Changed tor the betteratCranberry Lake.

Glad she drinks dry white wine
Instead ol swinging on a vine.

Goes to see Joe at the 'Cuse,
[Wish her always to have that ettcuse.

This winter she has learned to ski,
In the spring she’s to be a parachutee.

The point of this personal is not to have
thoughts spilled,

But to ektend belated birthday wishes to
Jan Hild.

A Friend forever and a day.
