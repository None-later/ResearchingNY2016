were sky-high while ours were as

this was foreshadowed even beforeit
began. Two Siena starters. center
Nelson Richardson and forward
<Frank Dyer dunked balls in the pre-
game drillsto the delight of the home
fans. These maneuvers only resulted
in technical fouls (dunking is not
allowed in college hoop) beingcalled
on Sicna which the Danes' Winston
Royal converted into a quick 2-0
Albany lead.

Albany retained possession. and

\working the ball around. quickly
opened up a four-point lead on
Cavanaugh‘s ten-foot jumper. But
Dycr‘s two free throws :and Chris
Maddcn‘s pair evened the score.

A Royal jumper and a Bob Audi
offensive rebound and bucket allow-
ed State to regain its lead but Russell
Clark‘s l5~footer a'nd Dyer's
baseline pop knotted matters once
again. -

Albany was in no hurry -
throughout the half as they
employed their “four-corner"

'offense looking for the open man. If
they did not ﬁnd anyone open. the
Danes were content to hold onto the
ball and pass off only when tightly

guarded. Royal and Trevett were the
main conspirators in this plot as they
directed the offense and thereby
assumed control of the game.

Audi said afterward that "by slow-
ing down we took them right out of
the game.“ Coach Kirsch. however.
regarded the stall as insignificant.
“We didn‘t play. that‘s all."

-In any case. the Indians‘ running

as they struggled to keep up with the
Danes‘ point total. With I0:30 left in
the ﬁrst half. Siena ﬁnally did over-
take Albany when Meyer connected
to give the hosts a 10-9 lead.

The lead see-sawed after that until
Richardson put Siena up by two at
20-l8 on an offensive tap. But over
the final 4:2i of the half. Siena was
stymied by the Albany man-toman
defense. “We would let the forwards
get off the initial pass to the guards
but we didn‘t give them the return
pass.“ said Trevett. Siena was forced
to take many outside shots and were
not faring well with them.

Albany. although at a marked
height disadvantage, managed to
out—rebound Siena by an amazing
22-l5 at the halfway mark. And they
managed to score eight consecutive
points before the buzzer. too.

Cavanaugh answered that with
Jabber-like hook to maintain the
six-point spread. Both teams then
alternated buckets for the next few
minutes. By now, play was opening
up and both teams were getting very
physical with eacii other. Butthe
foul calls that ensued slowed down
neither team.

With 13:50 left. however. Siena
still trailed by six. at 36-30. And this
is where Albany made its move.
Audi started it with a l5-foot
jumper. Suprunowicz padded it with
an all-alone layup off an inbounds
pass. and Winston ﬁnished it with a
turn-around jumper. With 12:26
remaining now. Albany led by l2.

When a squad of approximately
twenty members competes in in-
dividual events. the individual per—
formanccs and accomplishments
often are lost beneath the total team
tally and forgotten. It happens in
tennis. gymnastics and track. On
Friday evening it happened in swim-
ming and diving for some of State's
better aquawomcn.

It was off the blocks and into the
pool at the sound of the gun for Kim

Tricia Collins. who skimmed ll
seconds off her original time. set the
pace early in the 500 yard freestyle
event and managed to keep her lead
throughout each lap for a blue rib-
bon victory in 27.8 seconds.

On the boards. Albany's most ex-
perienced diver. Peggy Redinbaugh.
performed her characteristically

Albany might have been a little
over-confident. for it took an ex-

“Swimmer of the Meet“. Paul
Marshman. to put Oswcgo away.

The Danes led 56-50 as the final

(with seven points to the winner) got
underway. It was the same script
used at University l’ool when Rl’l

However. this time it was
Marshman who was the anchor
man. He was asked to make up the
two body lengths the aquamen
trailed by. and he responded to the
call with an impressive :50.Il show-
ing. quite sufficient to win the event
and. thus. the meet.

Marshman also won the l00—yd.

UAS; "To  Last Residence

by Steve Braekett,

UAS‘s house on Waverly Place
will change hands this year. accor-
ding to General Manager E. Norbert

'Zahm.

’ Zahm said that the UAS Board of
Directors has voted to give the on-
campus residence to SUNYA. The
university will take it over. with the
State of New York as the legal
owner.

The house hasyome to be known
as' Waverly Place. after the road
which leads to the two-story
residence from Western Ave.
Situated in several acres of woods
adjacent to the gym parking lot. it
was once a temporary housing facili-
ty for new faculty.

Losing Money

Zahm said Waverly Place is being
given away because it is not paying
for itself.

The transcation was initiated
three years ago. Zahm said that it
was the result of a more strict en-
forcementh" zoning laws by the
town of McKownville. which on-
composes that portion of SUNYA‘s
uptown campus. The town wants to
keep the area residential. said Zahm.

and since UAS is a private owner,
the zoning code applies to it. '
.“If we gave the house to‘ the state.“
he said. “the state law would
supersede the zoning code."

According to Dean for Student
Affairs Neil Brown. a member of the
UAS Board of Directors. UAS at
one time owned-20 small houses in
Albany. The board began selling
them. “until it came down to Waver-
ly Place."

Brown said that the board was
reluctant to sell the house because
"it's a valuable piece of property. be-
ing adjacent to the university." he
said.

He said that a motion was made to
give the property to the controller of
New York State. The property
would then be owned by the state.
under the direction of SUNYA's
president.

According to Zahm. the road
leading to the house is owned by
Albany Judge John E. Holt-Harris.
Jr. When asked why UAS didn't offer
to buy the road. Zahm replied.
“There was no reason to because we
were losing money on the property

SUNY Coordinator 'of Financial Aids Martin Lotltovita laid the TAP
application ls being revised due to this year's difficulties.

Concerned Faculty Reject
Union Pact With State

Some members of the SUNYA
faculty yesterday rejected the ten-
tative agreement reached earlier this
week between the SUN Y-wide facul-
ty union and the state.

In a press release issued by the
Committee ol Concerned Faculty.
the proposed agreement was labeled
“an assault upon thejob security of
all SUNY faculty members." The
CCF is a group of faculty members
formed to speak out on academic
freedom and research concerns at
SUNYA.

According to the release, if the
proposed agreement is ratified. it
would lessen the meaning of tenure
at SUNY as compared to the mean-
ing of tenure at nationally-
rccognized institutions of higher
education. _

“I would have to urge members to
vote against the ratification." said
CCF spokesman Jonathan Knight.
“As it stands now. it will pit faculty

against faculty."

Knight‘s objection to the propos-
cd agreement is a provision which
would enable a retrenched tenured
employee to bump it non-retrenched
tenured employee if he has seniority
over him.

“The faculty would be at each
other‘s throats.“ said Knight.

Another objection to the propos-
ed agreement is that "There are no
checks whatever on the unilateral
authority of management to remove
under the guise of retrenchment in-
dividuals whom they wish to get rid
of. The new contract provides no
protection for employees.“ accor-
ding to the release.

Knight said that if the guarantees
of a deﬁnite tenure system were
taken away. SUNY would be at a
disadvantage in attracting
nationally-recognized leaders in
their ﬁeld.

Because of problems .with water
supply and maintenance. UAS
decided to leave the house vacant. It
was costing $l.500 a year to keep up
the vacant property.

"But because people began to

' damage it." Zahm said...“we decided

to let students live in it." He felt that
the property would be protected if
people were living in the house.

Presently. there are three students
living in Waverly Place. Dave
LeBlang. an accounting senior.
collects the rent each month and
pays it at the UAS office in the com-
missary building.

Future Unclesr‘

LeBIang said that each month he
asks Zahm or his secretary if there is
any word aboutvthe future of the
house.

"We could be evicted anytime," he
said. “but l'm sure that they would
give us a 30-day notice."

LeBlang said that he was able to
move into Waverly Place because he
knew its previous resident, former
SA Vice President Ira Birnbaum. He
said that his two roommates were
able to move in forthe same reason.

“Since I knew Ira." LeBlang said.

Waverly House will be sold to the state bocuau It does not pay for
Itself. according to UAS General Manager E. Norbert Zahm.

“I went and talked to Zahm and he
let us move in."

LeBIang said that all three
students like living in the house
because of its seclusion from the
campus.

“Hardly anyone knows about the
house.“ he said.

Though the peaceful atmosphere
is pleasing. LeBlang said that they
have had problems with the water.

“We receive our water supply
from a well near Chapel House." he
said. “but it‘s not too good. We haye
to take showers in the gym.“

The future of'Wavcrly Place still
remains in doubt. When asked ifthe
university would continue housing

. residents in it. Residence Director

Jolin‘ Welty replied that he didn‘t
know what SUNYA was planningto
do with it.

TAP Question Still Unresolved

by- Jonathan Hodges

The Tuition Assistance Program
has been plagued for I I months by a
series of setbacks that have caused
serious problems for
vast numbers of
students.

As the program
enters the end of the state‘s fiscal
year ‘76-‘77. a number of questions
concerning this year‘s problems.
their corrections. and next year's
preventative measures have yet to be
fully answorcd.

The problems with TAP can be
traced to the Higher Education Ser-
vices Corporation. which ad-
ministers the program. HESC was
created by the state legislature in
I974 to bring together the various
state agencies providing student
financial assistance. It is this fusion
of agencies that HESC credits with
the delays.

"The problem started last year
when the corporation was set up.“
said HESC Vice President for Field
Services Graeme Baxter. “At that
time it married the old Higher
Education Assistance Corporation.
which administered the loan
program. and a piece of the State
Education Department."

Frought With Disaster

“Both those programs had to be
converted onto a central 068 [Of-
ﬁce of General Serviceslcomputer."
Baxter said. “and the computer con-
version process. as anyone who has
gone through it can tell you. Is
frought with disaster."

As this conversion was being
made. applications for TAP began
to pile up. In his testimony to the
Senate Committee on Higher
Education on the delay In TAP ad-
ministration. SUNYA. Director for
Financial Aid Donald Whitlock
chronologically outlined how be
perceived the breakdown.

“In April. over 20.000
applications were never delivered.

News

Analysis

because mailing labels fell off. Ad-
ditional applications were not made
available through the colleges," said
Whitlock. "In May. over 50.000
applications were submitted to
HESC; no action was taken on any
of them.“

According to Whitlock. the
backlog of applications rose each
month. HESC admittedtoa backlog
of 206.000 applications Dec. 1. near-
ly 50 per centl of all applications
recieved by HESC at that point in
time.

Students who were expecting
large awards were forced to either
use personal resources earmarked
for other expenses or obtain pay-
ment deferral from the Office of Stu~
dent Accounts.

Deferred Awards

"At SUNYA we allowed students
to defer the amount of last year‘s
award." said SUNYA Director of
Student Accounts Robert Acquino.
“For new students we allowed them
to defer the minimum award."

As pmhlcms mounted. the
pressure on HESC to correct the
delays grew. Senate hearings
questioned H ESC on the reasons for
the delay and for corrective
measures.

“We don‘t have our own computer
to process the TAP program." ex-
plained Baxter. “We share the com-
puter with approximately 30 other
agencies. We cannot control
priorities, we cannot say we‘ need a
job run now and have it run now.
Other people make the decision."

According to Baxter. HESC is one
of the biggest users of the new
Honeywell 6060 processing com-
puter. Questions concerning the
working relationship betWeen 008
and HESC have been raised by

Senate Majority Leader Warren

Anderson.

“Contrary to what the press
release from Senator Anderson's of-
fice implied. there is not a need for

more communication between the
various agencies." said Baxter. “We
have plenty of communication. _
What there is a need for is to solve
the basic problem of a huge, high
volume user being on a machine
shared with 30 other agencies and
not being able to control the job
scheduling and the prioritEs."

A large part of the delay was due
to growing inaccuracies in the names
and figures being released by HESC
to the various institutions.

“In examining a recentclaim from
the corporation. where only the
names of it)ch division students
should appear. we found about 60
upper division students." said
Whitlock. “This is a 24 per cent
error. compared to 1.08 per cent
error margin last year."

“According to Whitlock. students
have not been receiving awards;
often they have been getting awards
of the wrong amount. and in some
instances. students have been receiv-
ing more than one award notice.

One key problem in the TAPdelay
was caused by students filing for
emancipated status.

“The most frustrated group of
students at SUNY/t are the eman-
cipated." said Whitlock in ad-
dressing the Senate Higher Educa-
