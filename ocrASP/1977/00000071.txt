stances where students were charged
with misconduct in the library. both
cases originated in the early l970's.
One case involved a student whose
apartment was searched for goods he
had stolen elsewhere oncampus. The
search turned up thousands of

involved a student caught breaking

SUNY Central's Office of Finance
drew up a series ofguidelines in I969
for the handling ofthesc monies on
state operated'campuses.

Item 12 from the “Fiscal and Ac-
counting Proccdurcs for Mandatory
Student Activity Feesz"

“An annual audit shall be per-
formed by an independent accoun-
ting firm. The auditor’s report shall
be made available to the student
body. These audits do not preclude
periodic audits by the State Comp~
trollcr‘s Office as they deem
necessary." '

'l‘ltis May'l5 will mark the third
anniversary of SA‘s last audit. in
I974. A previous audit took place in
I972. and before that in 1970.

Harry Spindlcr. SUNY Central

 Vice Chancellor of: Finance and

Business said he is unaware of the
SA audit situation. Spindler said.
“The matter has Itot been brougltt to
my attention. If we were to discover
that these audits Weren‘t being
carried out. we‘d ask your ad-

ministration. ‘What's going on‘?‘ and ,

‘Wby not'." “

In Spindler‘s estimation. SA is
answerable to the university. not
SUNY Central. for infractions of
SUNY guidelines. Spindler said
these guidelines are not an “or else“

SUNY Central becomes state'law.
The state, though. has taken little

interest in the affairs of SA at :

SUNYA. The guideline quoted
above states that the annual audit
done (or not done. as the case may
be) on SA “does not preclude
periodic audits by the State Comp-
troller's Office. ',as they deem
necessary." According to Walter
Holmes. PR officer for the State
Comptroller Arthur Levitt. they try
to cover some eight thousand
organizations throughout the state
at least once every four years.

“We look in on everybody sooner
or later.“ said Holmes. The last time
they looked in on SUNYA was I974.

as the state is concerned, SA is OK.

City this week. it is unrealistic to ex-
pect any help from them. "Afterall." '
said Holmes. '“we’re only talking
about a million dollars. right?”
The state may not feel intimately
concerned with‘ SA’s questionable
operations. but they have caught the
eye of SUNYA's new Controller
John Hartigan. But Hartigansaid he
is unsure of the Administration's
role in SA policies. “The matter has
only recently come to my attention."
said Hartigan. “and. quite frankly. I
just don't know if the university has
the responsibility or the authority to
see that a proper audit is conducted."
In discussing the issue with former
Controller John Hartley and Presi-
dent Emmett Fields. Hartigan said
that the Administration is reluctant
to meddle in student affairs. “Could

about twice a decade. "except if we
suspect any shenanigans." said
Holmes. “in that case we'd try to in-
vestigate sooner.“ Holmes wouldn‘t
say whether SA‘s abuses qualify as
"shenanigans." but with the State
Comptroller taking on the Her-

tclling them how to keep their
books?"

There is a growing resistance
among SA officials against having
their books audited. And that
resistance has nothing to do with
anyone‘s fear of being caught with a
hand or two in the million dollar
cookie jar.

The reason SA President Steve Di

and Central Council Chairman Urcg

there hasn't been one since l974— it
would be a waste of money. If an

tion of the records pertainingto mis-
cellaneous receipts. Accordingly. we

receipts in the amount of S93.-
8l5.51..." ‘

Similar notes appeared on the
audits of I972 and I974.

Accounting firms explained “no

'opinion" as an auditing term used to

describe funds that are collected and
deposited irregularly.

What this means is that the money
SA receives from such things as con-
cdrts. films. and other student ac-
tivities is handled so sloppin that an
audit can‘t track it down. There is
“no opinion“ on these funds. which
is not as serious as an adverse opi—
nion. meaning loss or theft. but it
still spells mismanagement. That
receipt figure has more than tripled
since I970 and now weighs in at a
whopping $298.l44 of mishandled
student funds.

An audit today couldn't account
for nearly 3300.000. and in I975 the
state and federal laws concerning
audits were altered to specifythat no
accounting firm could come up with
a “partial opinion" audit: Meaning
that is an audit was performed on

dict on the entire SA operation.
because of the receipt money. This
has been the crux of DiMeo's
argument -—“Whyhave anaudit when'
the result would be meaningless?"

Suggests Revamp

The key is obviouslyto rcvnmpthe
way SA handles that $300,000 in
such a way that it can be audited
meaningfully. as suggested by SA
Vice President (iary Parker on
WSUA Inst Week.

In I970. State Comptroller Levit.
in reviewing our SA. criticized the
receipt procedttres. Ilc said that SA
should “adopt a uniform system of
budgeting and budgeting control. a
uniform system of accounting and
internal conlrol. and a uniform
system of accountability to the stu-
dent body.“

With SA elections annually bring-
ing in a new batch olfofl'icers. there is

no continuity in accounting from ‘

year to year. What Parker is calling
for is a management firm to come in
and advise them how to operate
professionally. Meeting the tough
demands for an audit that would be
fruitful would probably require per-
manent retention of an accounting
firm. said Parker. He said. accoun-
tants would check in regularly to
make sure things were running
smoothly. “The main concern is to
make those receipts accountable."
That might mean turnstiles at the
movies on campus and other devices
for keeping precise records on stu-
dent activity money. snid l’urkcr.
Reorganization Costly

DiMco said that this reorganiza-
tion “would be costly and not
worthwhile.“ He says he is not op-
posed to an audit. just to what it
'would take to have one. The cost for
restructuring SA to meet the
demands of SUNY Central would be
about 330.000 the first year for ad-
viscmcnl. implementation. and a to“
audit and about Sl5.000 each year
after that for a full audit. according
to SA estimates. $30.000 is only
about three per cent of SA‘s total
revenue.

llut cost is almost beside the point.
State law requires an annual audit.
yet DiMco said. “I am resisting it in
spite of that fact.“

Ilis refusal to initiate the
proceedings that would allow SA to
run as it was meant to not only en-
dangers his status as SA President.
but SA itself and the million dollars
of student tnoncy it controls.

All three accounting firms con-
tacted in gathering inlormation were
astonished to learn that SA is not
regularly monitored. According to
the accounting firms. on annual
audit is a standard good business
practice. It protnotcs the healthy
growth of a company. it keeps
employees hottest. and it cuts down
on wasteful spending.
