Press seeks Readers Who Read

 

 

HOLLYWOOD. (AP) A major
program to build newspaper circula-
tion was unveiled today by an in-
dustry official who called for the
restoration of "the public's
traditional feeling that reading the
newspaper every day is an essential
part of civilized existence.”

Otto A. Silha. president' of the
Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co..
and ch‘airman of the Newspaper

‘ Advertising Bureau. outlined the
three-year project during a keynote
address to the winter sales con-
fercnce of the International
Newspaper Advertising Executives
(INAE).

He said the Newspaper
Readership Project‘s major goal
would be to increase newspaper
readership and circulation in the face
of competition from broadcast
stations.

"The key challenge we face is to
convert younger people to the habit
of regular readership as they enter
the world of being active citizens and
consumers."Silha said. .

The project was developed by the
Newspaper Advertising Bureau and
the American Newspaper
Publishers Association (ANPA). but
will be supported by contributions
and ideas from many industry
sources. he said. The project includes
efforts in four areas: Research.

“It is also clear that due to an un-
usual combination of factors.
newspapers have a remarkable op-
portunity in the next few years to
assume a more important position
than they have ever held in the media
world." He said advertising content

: HEADHUNTERS

An investigator for '.the -Los
Angeles districtiattorney‘s ofﬁce is'
reporting that nursing homes in the
Los Angeles area are engaging In the -
buying and setting ofelderly patients
to ﬁll their extra bed spaces. 'Accor-l
ding to"=tleffrey Costner}: criminal
investiga'tor. nursing homes lose
money from medical and medicaid
payments if they have empty beds;
As a result. some pay "bounty" to
"headhunters" to findpatients to fill
the beds. Castner's investigation has
reportedly led to the uncovering of a
ring dealing in elderly patients. One
member of that ring. posing as a
representative of a local alcohol
rehabilitation program to the Los
Angeles courts. reportedly had some
80 elderly alcoholics released to him
for treatment. Then. according to
Castner. the ring turned around and
sold many of the elderly people to a
chain of nursing homes for $I25 a
head. Attorneys representing II of
the elderly victims state that when
their clients asked to leave the nur-
sing homes. they were given power-
ful psychiatric trunquilizing drugs
and were often beaten and locked up
to prevent them from leaving. As a
result of the case. the district at-
torney‘s office in Los Angeles has es-
tablished a “nursing home abuse
squad“ to investigate forced drugg-
ing and the buying and selling of
patients in southern California.

ANIMALISM

You've heard of sexism. racism
and even ugism. but how about
“unimalism”?

Animulism. of course. would be
the discrimination against tilt in-
dividual subject on the basis of his or
her animal background.

Dino De Luurentiis. the producer
of the new movie “KingKong”.
might soon be screaming about
nnimttlism. Dc Luurcntiis recently
asked for a ruling from the Motion
Picture Academy in Hollywood. ttnd
was told that his ginnt upc can not
qualify for the Best Actor ttwurd
next year.

According to the academy. even if

The National Marriage Guidance

Council reports that “sexual incom- _

patibility“ seems to have replaced
financialtrouble as the leadingcause

. of divorce in' America.

According to the council. the so-
called Sexual Revolution is partially
responsible for the change: couples
reportedly hear more and know
more about sex. and if their love lives
are poor. they are less hesitant about
seeking advice and even breaking up,
if necessary.

LIVING DEAD

One of the nation‘s pioneer
researchers on the subject of death
and dying is now reporting that she
was visited by the spiritxof avdcad
patient nine years ago. Doctor
Elizabth Kublcr-Ross. who last
year attracted nationwide attention
when she announced shc believed
there was life after death. says she
dismissed the incident at the time as
it hoax or hallucination. Since then.
howcvcr. the doctor reports she has
become convinced that it was a
“spontaneous mittcriuliztition“ of
somebody who had died almost it
year before the incident occurred.
Kublcr-Ross says the incident oc-
curred ill a time when she was
seriously considering giving up her
years of research with terminally ill
patients.

The doctor reports that a woman
suddenly appeared in her ofﬁce. and
introduced herself as a patient who
had died ten months earlier. and
pleaded with Kublcr-Ross to not

_ quit her research. The visitor. the
doctor says. looked identical to the
former patient. The doctor says that
before the woman left. she asked the
woman to write a note to her
minister. and that note. Kublcr-Ross
states. is now preserved "under
glass.“ Handwriting analysis has in-
dicated the note matches exactly the
handwriting of the deceased patient.
the doctor says.

Kublcr-Ross says she has not ex-
pericnccd any more apparent
ttinlcritilirrttions. but that her
research has thoroughly convinced
her there is litc after death.

HEARING LOSS
A Utuh audiology professor is
warning that alcohol and loud rock
concerts don‘t mix.

University of Utah says a series of

Robinette says, that four
volunteers spent about 50 hours
apiece getting smashed or going
through control sessions without
alcohol while listening to clamorous
music. '

LIPSERVICE

If you want to tell your co—Workers
off. but haven‘t got the nerve. you
might consider giving them some
Iipservicc.

For $5. Lipservicc. a San Fran-
cisco based company started tip by
Philip Abrams. will call upthc object
of your love or hate and givethcm a
message.

Abrams says he started upthc scr-
vicc for people who. through fear or
shyness. can't pick up the phone
themselves and say how they feel.

Abrams charges $5 for a single
message. but for $7.50 he will ask the
other party for a reply and call you
back. The bargain hunter. Abrams
says. can get three messages
delivered for a mere SI2. '

Abrams says he delivers the
message with appropriate emotions.
including anger and sympathy. and
that his lipservice can even bedishcd
out in Russian. Chinese. Spanish
and a host of other tongues.

All of the volunteers. the doctor
says. displayed distinct losses of cf-
t'iclency in dealing with harmlully-

loud noises when drunk.

According to Robincttc. the
alcohol causes muscles in the inner
car. which normally protect listeners
from loud noises. to react slowly.
Drinking nt loud concerts. he warns,
could result in noises that are nor
mally harmless doing permanent
damage to the ear.

NUCLEAR LIABILITY

A series of new reports indicates
that US insurance companies have
paid out at least 5600.000 to settle
various radiation related injury-

promoting the . nstniction of  _
atomic power’pla'nts. has boasted of

having an almost perfect safety

record. ‘

However. reports filed with the
Nuclear Energy Liability Property
Insurance Association reveal that
there have been at least 30 radiation-
injury incidents since I957. two of
_them resulting in deaths. None ot‘the
incidents occurred at power plant
sites; most happened in the process

I of shipping nuclear materials.

In one incident. an atomic
worker's family received a 5300.000
settlement after he died of cancer
following exposure to plutoniu'i.
Another $70,000 settlement w.
made after a worker at a recover_
plant was killed by being exposed to
heavy doses of radiation.

The US government currently sets
limits on the amount of money a per-
son can collect for injuries rcsttlting
from nuclear power plant accidents.

BIOMORPHIC CITY

A southern California planner
says that cities 'of the future should
be built on supports hundreds of feet
above the ground. lcavingthccttrth‘s
surface below as a nut urul wilderness
area.

Architect Glen Small calls his con-
cept of cities in thc sky“Biomorphic
Biosphere.“ Small has constructed
scale models of his futuristic plans
that illustrate massive cities.
reaching 800 feet into the air. sup-
ported on points of a nicgastructure

c ground a mile or so apart.

In the aerial city. Small says.
houses will be constructed as pod-
like capsules. and the walls would
open and closed like the petals ofa
ﬂower.

Small says “We have the
technology. Machines could be
developed to accomplish all sorts of
tasks. to repair themselves. to build
other machines."

In the meantime. he says, the earth
below would become a true natural
wilderness area preserved for the
generations of the future.

The newest member of the Bay

Eighteen-yeaoold Ian Mitchell.

want to put his head in the oven and
end it all.

Mitchell says: "I want to have the

CANCER RATES

A Federal Government-
sponsored study of the death rate
among atomic power plant workers
concludes that nuclear plant workers
are dying of cancer at higher rates
than other workers.

The IZ-year study. financed by
$5.2 million in government grants.
was based on the death certificates of
more than 3.300 atomic workers

.who died between I944 and I972.

If the findings are accurate. it
would indicate that the
government‘s permissible levels of
radiation in nuclear plants are too
high because all of the workers
studied received less than the per—
missible levels of exposure during
their lifetimes.

The study. known as the
Muncuso-Stewart findings. has
triggered an immediate response
from the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission. The commission says that
there may be some statistical errors
in the calculations.

Two radiation experts on the staff
of" the Natural Resources Defense
Council. a group critical of nuclear
power. say that the statistics indicate
that a person who works inu nuclear
plant for’lb years doubles his or her
chances of dying of cancer.

The New York Times reports that
this lutest study pnrullcls findings
of n University of Washington study
two years ago. The Washington Sur-
vcy of 310.000 deaths also concluded
that there seemed to be it somewhat
higher cancer death rate than would
be expected among atomic power
plant employees.
