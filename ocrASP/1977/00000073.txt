1 To the Elton ‘ T

I felt it necessary to write and say a few;

‘ words about the soda battle project'here at

SUNYAJ am in favor of it becoming a
campus-wide practice; and feel that some
positiVe feeling should be-shown. -

The bottles are not a problem. They are
siIr_Iply an inconvenience for the people who
find it easier to throw a can away than to walk
down a ﬂight or two of stairs.

Throwaways must be phased out with
previous or renewed practices to replace them.
We can't afford throwaways. It might not be
evident here on campus. but it surely is in
Albanyand surrounding areas. Sites for gar:
bage dumping and landﬁlls are swiftly dis-
appearing. .

I urge people to support the bottle project.
despite the inconveniences. There was a time
when. as kids. we would collect bottles off the‘
streets and take them to the neighborhood
grocery for a few pennies. Now. it's not the
money that matters. It‘s what this project sym-
bolizes that counts. If young people show a
lack of concern about the future. what type of
incentive is that fOr others? All this may sound
a bit melodramatic. but I don't think it‘s
wrong to ask people to be concerned. Make a
choice before there is no choice.

but no thanks

To the Editor:

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the
few Cooper Hall residents who had the guts to
turn away twa very cold people from the only
shelter available at a recent toboganning out-
ing at Mohawk Campus. Ot'the two shelters at
Mohawk. one was off limits to all females.
This was because a male student was in the

i  of having his leg splinted after a-

toboggan crashedrinto his leg. The other
shelter was inhabited by a'few cooper Hall
residents, exclusively—and] mean exclusive:

To the Editor:

We wish to thank Bob Audi. Barry
Cavanaugh. Vic Cesare. Kevin Keane. Dave
Landry. Winston Royal. Mike Supronowicz.
Gary Trevett. Carmella Verdejo’. Staton
Winston. Buddy Wleklinski. and everyone
elseconnected with the Great Dane basketball
team. The thank you is. of course. for last
Thursday night‘s victory over Siena. and for

' all that the victory represented.

As seniors at SUNYA we have lived and
died with each Albany-Siena encounter.
Those of us who were here as freshmen. four
years ago. will never forget Byron Miller‘s last
second shot that beat the Indians at our un-
iversity gym. That was our first taste of this
tremendous rivalry; obviously it was enough
to make us look forward to the future. Unfor-
tunately. the bitter taste of last year‘s troun-
cing by the Indians. on the same court. also
remains a memory of this intense rivalry.
However. these are the things that rivalries are
made of. We just have to swallow our pride
and wait for nexttyear.

Last Thursday‘s game made the wait well
worth the while. It will remain. for us. the
sweetest memory of all. Anyone who missed
the game. missed what will probably go down
in history as the most satisfying Great Dane
victory ever. We entered Siena‘s recreation
center knowing this would be the last time
Albany would play Siena. They said we
couldn‘t compete with them now that they
were a Division I team. They couldn't disgrace

The setting was just too perfect. Mighty S on

going to‘c'ome out in front of the' home

crowd ind crush the lowly Dartes,fproving.‘
once and for all. that-we didn‘t belong in the

V same county ,with the lndigns. Well. we all

~ know, what happened. Albany’s coach and his

‘ players put on a‘ basketball exhibition that will

be very difficult to ever match. The night
belonged to usxT he Albany players owned the
floor, and the Albany fans owned the stands.
Even if the Danes go on and win the SUNY
conference title, and anything that might
follow. it would seem anti<climatic. Last
Thursday night was unlike any other night
that ever was or probably ever will be. The
feeling that that' victory produced was
something/we had never really known. It was
the big game that Albany didn't lose. It was
four years of frustration somehow reconciled
in one night.

However. with the good must come the bad.
There were two unforgivablc crimes com-
mitted by the ending ofthis series. First. future
students at Albany and Siena will never again
know the feeling of a rivalry like this. Second.
Siena has no next year to look forward to with
Albany.

Thank you agai 1. coach and players. for
playing with‘dignily and pride. Thank you for
this one last memory. Most of all. thank you
forbeing the best damn basketball team in the
Capital District. «

“roots” . . .
uprooted

To the Editor:

We are outraged by the insensitive and
abusive treatment given seven SUNYA
students on the program. “Roots: A Reac-
tion."

On Thursday. January 27. We were in-
formed that Channel 13 wanted to interview
some SUNYA students. and get their
responses to the series "Roots." After exten-

 
 

 

sive taping. we were angered 5nd disappointed
by the way in which the station did the editing.
We ' realize the program, had only one-half
hour of air time; there is ho‘objection to the
small allotment of time we received. However.
we are disturbed by the fact that a significant
number of important statements were either
ignored or taken out'of context. Censequent-
ly, our views were distorted and mis-
understood. These misconceptions may have a
serious impact on future educational ex-
periences on local television.

We also object to the ignorance of our par-

"ticipation and the organizing efforts of Linda

Gill.

The exploitative use of our feelings and
thoughts .cannot be overlooked or forgiven.
We urge all those concerned in the matter to
call or write the station and express their
views.

Last Week. I received a postcard through the
