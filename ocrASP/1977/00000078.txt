Nothing but Problems

I
by Dsnlel Gslnes '
I wouldn‘t worry about the Student
Association if I were you. It takes eare of itself.
It pays itself. for one thing. There are
moralistic debates in the halls of Central
Council about whether certain groups deserve
to get any money. usually labeled "stipends,"
for their efforts. yet the President, Vice-Presi-
dent and Controller collect their $1500 apiece
without. much ado. The Central Council
Chairperson and his deputy receive smaller
amounts. Council members often are in-
terested in becoming Presidents. Vice
Presidents or Controllers. and so do not often
try to straighten salaries out. Nobody wants to
rock the boat.
lwouldn't worry about whether SA can ﬁnd
things to do, either. They always ﬁnd
something to do. If they run out of external
issues like campus lighting. they can switch
to internal issues—like trying to impeach
one another. Obviously. they have nothing to
do now. Therefore, they are trying to remove
SA Vice President Gary Parker. and they are
trying to make the process as complicated as
possible. For example. they added a new con-
cept to constitutional removal of executives.
In the past. they voted to impeach. and then
held a trial. Now. they vote“: request for
resignation, present the evidence in an effort
to obtain resignation. vote whether to im-

peach, and ﬁnally hold a trial.

I wouldn't worry about SA's effect on
students. because students know to keep their
distance from SA. They stay busy in their
groups. or alone, and deal with SA only if they
have no other alternative. This year has been a
quiet one for students, the SA ofﬁcials
generally agreeing that administrators are
nicer to students than they. Thus, there is lit-
tle need to prod the campus authorities.

Them could be things to worry about in the
future. however. We might worry about what
SA people will do in an effort to get elected.
We should also worry about what noise they
will make. how they will invent issues. and
who will get hurt in the process.

We might want to worry about whether
Steve DiMeo will do anything significant this
year. We are used to seeing little happen, but
he still may present a revolutionary budget.
We can doubt it. but we can still worry about
It.

Lastly. we should worry about how long
Central Council can exist. We can worry that
Chairperson Greg Lessne is no longer a
babysitter. but rather an absent father. We can
worry about whether students who are blind.
deaf. and dumb will want to kecpjoiningCen-
tral Council and then resigning from it.

But we can‘t worry too much. We have to
get good grades.

THE SOUL"

' by Jack Simmons - ‘ r
The word “stud” is u vague as “stoned.”
and as demanding as “jsp.” It offers us a titb.
bestowed in admiration or condemnation of
an individual male. It requires no further ex?
planation since that would be an impossible
task. Sufﬁce to say. a stud is a guy capable of
getting a date during ﬁnals week.

A stud does not require a sense of humor as
much as he requires a sense of timing. Who
else could accompany Denise to the campus
center at twelve o‘clock and keep a lunch date
on Indian at ﬁve after? It is a myth that studs
carry little black books in which they mark
down appointments. In actuality. they come in
various colors.

Studs come in all shapes and sizes. No better
proof ofthis is availablethanthe witnessing of
one disposing of his garbage. Oddly enough,
campus studs are always wearing gym shorts
whenever the garbage pail needs to be emp-
tied. Any girl or gay lucky enough to have his
or her door opened. will be privileged to get a
look at this “blow-dried" Adonis strolling
by.

A stud is one of the rare breed that has
learned it is easier to pick up a girlat a fire drill
than at a quad party. This is the reason many
of them show up to tire drills as if they were
social events. Fire drills provide a wonderful,
panoramic view of what exactly is available.
This. in the long run, saves a great deal oftime
and energy.

Without a doubt, a stud's most valuable
asset is the very noticeable bulge in his jeans.
Without his wallet. he would be forced to hang

wheels (wired for orgasms) you'll take off for'

. places you never thought existed. Together

you'll dine at "2]," drive through the parking
lot at 55. and end up in his room for 69.

Back in' his room, he'll thrill you with the
most sensuous. orgiastic sounds you’ve ever ‘
heard. Then he‘ll turn on the record player.
While in his room, there will be no' need to
guard yourself against his attempts to make
you relax. He‘ll be spending most of his time
answering the phone. and stepping out into
the hall as far as the cord will reach. If you're ‘
curious enough to listen. you might hear him
whisper over the phone. “Yeah. I know baby.
but I don‘t think we should get serious yet."

Along his walls you‘ll view five or six
sweetheart cards from his past girlfriends. If
he is really conceited. they will be arranged
alphabetically. You might see one addressed
to the sexiest guy lever knew. If you open it.
don‘t be surprised if it‘s signed _— Love. Mom.

Apologiling for the interruptions. he
returns only after disengaging the receiver.
This will prevent any further disturbances.
Spying the bottle ofwine on his desk, you will
feel the silence of the room surrender to the
velvet lushness of Fleetwood Mac. As he slides
close to you. you will see why all the girls call
him a stud. But before he has achance to work
his magic. the seemingly endless moment is
shattered by the persistent scream of the ever
present ﬁre bell.
