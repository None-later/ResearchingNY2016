F-E-AiT. -It is not" conducive‘to
backflips and other cheerleader ex-
uberance. No spectatar‘wants' it to

happen on his 37. No

Sm coach wants to see
himself ' as
broomstraw dangling
at half-mast; No alumnus wants
sponge-kneed. bubble-bellied
linebackers who run the loo-yard
marathon in MS eating any of the
prize beef he so generously con»
tributed to the cause.

Take this down. We want V-l-C-
T-O-R-Y. Whereas this great coun-
try was predicated on victory;
whereas winners build second decks,
visit combat zones and shave for
dollars; whereas losers step to the
rear; wheras tying is like kissing your
sister; and whereas not five people
can tell you who won the
sportsmanship trophy last year. we
choose V-l-C-T—O-R-Y. It is more
American than Alistair Cooke.

The underside of the rock is
defeat. which is why there are one-
year contracts, second teams. suicide
squads. waivers and other fail-safes.

Feature

all ﬁne print to assure us that'

anybody not subscribing to the V-l-
C-T-O-R—Y theory will be promptly
censored. Losing coaches go into
“private business". a never-never
land of buddies and relatives who
own companies.

Defeat. then. is analogous to bad
times. If Ecology is a game, defeat is
a man-made cloud. If society is com-
petition, defeat is uncmployment. it
is so condemning it deserves acure.

As a player. winning makes
everything tolerable. It even makes
ugly people seem pretty. It is funny.
A free throw. or a backhand'down
the line or a single to left-center re-
quires but it second to execute. But
they can be simulated in the playing
field of a mind. replayed without
cues. and can account for years of
hero dreams.

In the summer of last year i had a
thirst for victory; I expected it. The
eventual outcome was its certain as a
hug from an aunt. Our softball team,
the HM (E for Evaluation. A for
Assessment) All-Stars were about to

the illusive championship). The
that sex was about to winthe't‘itle
was remarkable when you consider
in I975 the team members con-
sidered a hit anything that the
catcher didn't catch. HA ﬁnished
last that season. A shaky eighth. l
playeda few games at third base. and
out pitcher was such that I played
deep. throwing most grounders to
second. I . , . '

But this was the good year I976. l
was at shortsiop. and except for a
.handful of errors—l remember the
ground ball agath Mental Health
that I lost when dry earth ate it—my
glove had been a faithful compa-
man.

My bat was as deadly as a
rattlesnake—except for one day
when nine consecutive knuckleballs
struck me out three consecutive
times. Sometimes during very good
years it rains. however..and in the
ﬁfth inning this one was drowned;
whereas lam ofﬁcially 0 for 0 at bat.
and although I still have nightmares
about that violent knuckleball. it is
on the books as a mirage.

It was the ﬁnal weekend of the
season. We were hot stuff. To win
the title we had to take one ofthree
from Taxation. which obviously
could be done over the phone. Taxa-
tion was last. its team batting
average was all ones and twos.

We lost the ﬁrst game l-0. lwas 2
for 3: it seemed the only people on

- base that game were their fielders.
Between games there was no panic.
only mild concern. The second game
of the doubleheader concluded with
our rightfielder wondering what that
was that ringed over his cap. lt wasa
softball. moving on, we told him.
The homer scored two runs.
resulting in another loss for us.

Sunday was another day, but
Saturday night would not end. After
watching the sun come up with a
beer can in one hand and a small
blond dancing machine in the other,
we arrived at the playing ﬁeld mean.
realizing bills worked better when
swung. I hit one out, our catcher hit

wonders what players talk about
during those peace negotihtions it-
the mound. l‘remember once calling
time-out and telling our pitcher that j
I would kill him if one more of their ’
people 'got on base. The umpire ‘

‘ warned me about swearing on the

So we lost the champiohship by a
fraction to Legal Department. When
we got back home someone told us 7
the keg of beer we had put on ice to
celebrate the title was stolen.

So what does a competitor do I
when defeat sneaks up like a mugger
who never cares who much you
worked? Do you look back at
luckiess. caught line drives? Sure.
and you hurt and pout and alibi and
kick doors and feel as if you just
broke some kid's CARE package
because you wanted a between-meal
snack.

And maybe later you will learn
that feelings you had out around
shortstop are similar to the feelings
you will have again. Maybe youcan-
not hide defeat. But maybe you can
deﬁne athletics as a game. a warmup
for feelings and other thinking parts.
to see it they work.

Defeat has been the undoing of
some mighty nice characters. among

those the Hare. who was accused of
easy scheduling and ovcrconfidcncc.
After being upset by the Tortoise.
the Hare suffered psychological
damage. He probably lost it stcpand
wound up in quite a slew. The Tar-
toisc endorses soup. Goliath was
melted down and bccamc the New
York Nets.

And then there is Casey oflhe big
but. of Mudville. which does not
sound like Palm Springs. Casey
whiffed. Fanncd. Mighty Casey.
always muscled. once adored, struck
out with men on second and third in
the lust inning.

It is funny you don't remember the
winning pitcher. it may be because
the next season Casey hit this fellow'

like he owned him. Casey led the
league in RBIs and was voted MVP.
Mudvillc was renamed Happy
Hollow.

Which is another way of saying
defeat is not terminal as long its there
is another day to plan another game.
