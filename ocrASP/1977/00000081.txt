“We've got to beat them orthcy‘ll

coach Dick Sauers. It's showdown
time tonight in what will be the most
important game for the Albany
Great Danes this year. The Danes

regardless of what its pursucrs do.

What should make tonight‘s con—
test even more interesting is the fact
that both the bears and the Danes
have a lot of overall depth and go to
their benches without hesitation.
Potsdam coach Jerry Welsh uses ten
men almost interchangably while
Albany's Sauers employs a nine-man
rotation most of the time. But the in-
jury to Staton Winston Tuesday

doubtful starter.

“They're a fast-breaking club,”
says Sauers 6f Potsdam. “And if they
get a lead. they like to stall."

“When you play badly. it's nice to
win," said Albany volleyball coach
Ted Earl after it was over. The
Albany spikers had just won their
ﬁrst two matches of the season
against New Pain. and Union at the
gym Wednesday night. but forthem
it was not good enough. ‘

“Volleyball is a team game and w
didn't play as a team." explained
Earl. “They (the players) were play-
ing very well in practice but tonight
they were tentative."

After New l’altz defeated Unionin
two straight matches, they faced
Albany in the big meeting of the
evening. The first game with Albany
grabbing a 20 lead before New Paltz
began to find the range, scoring the
next seven in a row to lead 7-2.

But Albany's l’at Dwyer brought
the hosts back with a few of his
patented "power" spikes and Albany
managed to cut it to 7-6 before New
Paltz scored again. From there.
Albany garnered the next six in a
row and hung on for a 15-") win.
Dwight Buck and Doug Buzzard did
most of the damage at the end with
some well-placed spikes.

The second game saw the visitors
jump out to a quick 8-3 lead before
the Spikers came back to tie it at
nine. New Paitz was having trouble

 Budget  ACcepted § '

by Thomas Mertellu

A reviewing committee has
accepted President Fields‘ tentative
plan for budget cuts at SUNYA.

' According to the plan. reductions
from SUNYA will total $80l.592.
which is about $73,000 more than
the required reduction mandated by
Governor Carey last month. The
bulk of the 373.000 will be funnelled
into the support of graduate studies
at SUNYA.

Following Governor Carey‘s
January budget proposal for
SUNYA. Fields made recommen-
dations as to where the cuts should
come frotn. He delegated respon-
sibility to a task force comprised
lttrgcly of members from the
Resource Allocation Committee of
the University Sentatc to study the
matter and react to the plan.

The committee. which has been
meeting regularly since Jan. 31. will

present ’a report to Fields today that
generally agrees with the plan. The
two students on the committee have
not supported the report and are
presenting their own minority report
to Fields.

“We tried as best we could to
assess the projected budget and
assess the cuts‘ impact." said Com-
mittee Chairman John Rosenbach.
“The general sense of the group was
that the proposal and the process
were reasonable."

According to the plan. five vacant
faculty lines will be eliminated. as
well as eight vacant support
positions. Other major cuts include
the elimination of several positions
in maintenance and operation. aux-
iliary residence as well as positions in
academic support.

"I feel that we came up with a
logical plan." said Assistant to the
President Robert Shirley. “It was the

best under the. circumstances we‘
were handed by Governor Carey." ‘
7 Accoi'ding to Shirley. the budget
plan was drawn up with the input of
SUN YA‘s vice presidents. deans and
directors of various programs.

“We then sent it to the committee
of the University Senate to work
directly with the president." said
Shirely.

Although Carey‘s executive
budget requires that three auxiliary
residence positiont. be eliminated.
Fields' plan calls for the reduction of
7.6 positions.

This. coupled with one extra
reduction in maintenance and opera-
tioti and two extra reductions in
general institutional services. leaves
a surplus of nearly $73,000. which
will be utilized towards graduate
studies and other areas.

“The money will go towards the

SAT May Replace Regents Exam

by llryan llolzberg

Elimination of the state Regents
Scholarship Examination has been
recommended by Governor Hugh
Carey. Regents scholarships awards
would be based on students‘ scores

on the privately-administered

Scholastic Aptitude Test.

But the Board of Regents has ob-
jections to the Executive liudgct
proposal. according to a spokesman
for the Education Department.

The department believes there are
some differences between the two cx-
aminations. according to the
spokesman. He said. “One is an ap-
titude and achievement test and the

CDTA Modiﬁes Takeover Plan

by Edward Rader

A new proposal presented last
’I'hursdny by CDTA to take over
SUNYA‘s bus service has received a
mixed reaction from members ofthe
SUNYA llus Committee and strong
opposition from Alumni Quad.

The new Capital District
Transportation Autltority proposal
calls lor more frequent service dur-
ing peak hours along Western Ave.
up to the Administration Circle.
Past proposals by CD'I'A would
have provided service to SUNYA‘s
Western Ave. cntruncc. Washington
Ave. service Would have been
provided every 20 minutes during
the day and then once an hour from
six to ten p.m..

The proposal. which is the
culmination of meetings between
CD'I'A staff and SUNYA communi-
ty members. would cost SUNYA
$321000 in I‘cdcral nnitchingfunds.

“lt's not adequate." says SA
Presidents and Committee Member
Steve DiMco. He said he is concern-
ed with students living north of
Washington Ave. being stranded or
facing long walks after ten p.m.. "If
we have problems. who are they
answerable to?" said DiMco. "ll'
CDTA wants our business. they'll
have to give us at least what we have
right now."

After being informed of the new
proposal. Alttrnni Quad l’rcsidcnt
Sue Sokol said that “We still take
our same stand.“ and that she is
definitely opposed to the CDTA
takeover.

Alumni Quad Board has voiced
opposition to the idea of CDTA be-
ing the sole transport agent on cam-
pus, They are do concerned with
the luturc of SUNYA bus drivers
who would be placed on the bottom
of it seniority list by CDT/t.

Sokol said that plans are under
way to distribute petitions ex-
pressing opposition to CDTA on all
live quads starting Tuesday on the
dinner lines. Bus drivers have
already been circulating petitions.
asking students to sign them as they
come on tile bus.

SUNYA Bus Committee Chair-
man Robert Steircr said that.
"They've cotnc closer [with the new
proposal] to meeting our rc-
quiretncnts." Slcircr is Assistant
Vice President for Business and
Finance. Another member of the
committee. Off-Campus llousing
Office Director Karlcen Karlson,
said that CDTA is “coming closer to
what campus expectations are."

Phone calls made last week by
CD'I‘A representative Keith Barber
to members ofthe committee urous~

cd negative feelings of members.
DiMco said linrbcr was “trying to
circumvent the committee by calling
members individually." Steircr said.
"It doesn‘t help their cause to try
these tactics. The phone calls have
ceased at my request and at the re-
quest of others.“

other an aptitude test.“

Stale Chief Budget Examiner
l’aul Vcillettc said there is over an 80
per cent correlation between the two
examinations. “This is a natural area
of cost uttd benefit." he said.

The Regents Exam and SA’I"s are
“already both taken by 85 per cent of
high school seniors. We can reduce
duplication testing by taking a well-
accepted. well-established national
test in place of our independent test
and save one million dollars in
costs."

The Governor‘s proposal reads
"the abolition of the Regent‘s
Scholarship Exantination would
save local schools over 5750.000 per
year us they will no longer have to
administer the scholarship cx-
aminutions,“ An additional $202.—
787. it was estimated in the report.
will be saved by red ucing Education
Department costs related to the ex-
antination.

“Here‘s a million dollarsto be sav-
ed." said Vcillette. “What's the alter-
native? Takc one million out of
SUNY‘s budget with no substitute.
Here we have a compatible sub-
stitute."

Department is “more or less against“
the proposal because they wishto rc-
tain employees on their payroll who
would otherwise be cut.

l'rcscnt state law permits the
Board of Regents to authorize other
tests in place of their own test but
they have been rclttcttt'nt.lo do so in
the past.

The Regents Exam scores have
been used as criteria for more than
20.000 state scholarships ycttrly. In a
related matter. Carey further
proposed to reduce Regents
Scholarship costs by phasing out
some 7.000 Regents scholarship re-
awards (alternates) to save on ad-
ditional estimated one million
dollars. He said in tltc budget
proposal. “Since the primary pur-
pose of . chcnls‘ College
Scholarships is to promote cx-
ccllcncc. the practice of rcawarding
scholarships to iOWCI'fSCOFlHQ
students does not do this."

SAT. l-ZTS. and NYI’IRG

The SAT as developed by
Educational Testing Service has
been used by universities, as a
method of academic screening.
NYl’lRG at SUNYA Chairperson
Kevin Kovacs said ETS“Determines
what school you get into. and now
Carey would have it determine your
money for school. It's outrageous.
Students are controlled by ETS and
we‘re trying to reverse that.”

Details of how .the governor's
proposal would work have not been
worked out. Veillctte said. “It was up
to the imagination of ad-
ministrators. The Regents' have

' much ﬂexibility."
