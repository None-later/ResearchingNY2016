Maxell tape enjoys wide acceptance among
tape recording perfectionists both professional
and amateur alike. Which doesn’t come as a sur-
prise to us. At Tech Hill, we've found that
Maxell tape offers superlative sound and unsur-
passed uniformity. It's tape you can trust to
perform at Its best from sample to sample.

Maxell cassettes have unique features that
set them apart from all other cassettes. The
leader in Maxell cassettes actually cleans all parts
along the tape path (including the heads) for 5
seconds before the magnetic tape appears. The
Maxell cassette shell is special,
sure it's jam-proof that they offer an uncondi~
tional, lifetime replacement guarantee!

Maxell's top-of-the-iine UDXL cassettes are
available in two configurations. Maxell UDXL. l
is designed for iow~noise/high output bias settings.
while Maxell UDXL ii is designed to match
chromium dioxide bias settings. A new magnetic
particle named Epitaxial makes possible some of
the widest range, lowest distortion recordings
ever possible with cassettes. While Maxell UDXL.
cassettes are designed for the highest fidelity in
the finest cassette decks. Tech Hifi is sure that
you'll enjoy the improved sound and extra re-
liability Maxell offers, even if you own a budget
deck.

Maxell UD is open-reel tape of studio
quality. Many of today's most highly regarded
open-reel decks come biased from the factory
for Maxell UD (if the most respected rape deck
manufacturers demand Maxell tape,._you should
too!)

Come in to Tech Hifi and try Maxell tape.
Find out for yourself just how good your tape
deck can sound! And while you're in our store.
ask for your FREE copy of "The Hifi Book"

information about Maxell tape and every major
line of quality hifi components and accessories.
