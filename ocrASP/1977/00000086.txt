To the Editor:

(In l‘Uhl‘tllll')‘ ltitlt. NYI‘IRUwillgotoCcn-
trtil Council and ask for :i bitidiitg referendum
allowing students to determine whether or not
they want to contintie funding NYI’IRO. It is
my leeling tltiit students will once again show
tltetr oterwlielintng support for our orgiiiii/a-
tioii.

In its seveti year ltistory. NYI’IRti has es-
tablished itscll as the largest aitd most
successlul I’IRU in the country. A loss of the
SUNYA chapter would not only seriously
allch the oi‘gtini/iitioti. btit it would hear blow
for the entire piihlie interest rno\enient. NYI'-
IRU. as the pitblic interest extension of
heightened student consciousness. is the ritost
powerful consumer advocate in the stiite. the
most :iggt'cssite public lighter for social
iiistiee. and a driving lorce for safe energy and

‘t-ittiritnmctttal protection. We provide a ser-
\ree Ior students in tltat:

terest workfor students. whether they are in-
terested in law. biology or business. Some ISO

- gristudents devote time/to NYPIRG work each

terns.
Therefore. I urge students to rally behind
the‘NYl’lRti cause. Speak to your Central
Council representatives and make your

cil to vote “yes” on a mandatory binding
referendum. iind allow the voice of the
students to be heard on this important issue.

how to stop
a tow truck

To the Editor:

I live in Alden Hall on the downtown cam—
ptts. I own a crir. and usually park it in the
siiiiill Alden parking lot.

When I came back from classes on 'I'uesday.
Feb. ll. I noticed that nty car was about ten feet
lrortt where I had left it the ttigltt before. When
I got iii to move it back. I found it itt neutral
with the parking brake on. The night before. I
had lelt the ear iii getir with the parkitig brake
oil. I also noticed that a car which looked
abandoned wasn‘t there anymore.

I called Security to find out il'thcir tow truck
liiid removed a car from the downtown cam-
ptis. I was referred to a Mr. I‘Ieiinigan. the
Assistant Director of the Department of
Public Safety. He informed me that the tow
trtick did remove at car lrom the lot. and in the
process moved another car which Wits iii the
way. He said the tow trtick oper-iitor tried to
get in touch with tile. btit couldn't. the
operator then made illegal entry into iity car.
took it otit ol gear. and pttslted it ottt ol the
way with ltis towtrtiek. I asked Mr. Hennigait
how the operator i‘l/cgrilfr entered itty car. He
IL‘pllL‘d. “()h. we have tools for that." isn't it
nice to know that our tax dollars go for tools
which ciiit he. arid are. tised for illcgtil pur-
poses. as in my case.

Mr. lleniiigini apologized for the action of
the operator iiitd left it ltl that. He said the
operator wouldn‘t do it again. I wonder it'the

poor research

To the Editor:

I would like to say tltat Jonathan Hodges'
article. "l’arking Favors (liven by Parker." is
one at the fittest pieces ol'shabbyjournalism
ever printed hytlte ASP. It is ittcrediblc that
arty newspaper would allow something like
this to be printed. Once again. you ltave shown
a relined iibility to rnisconstrtic facts and. con-
etirreutly. assume your own personal inter-
pretations to be absolutely true. I challenge
you to deny the later that this article was poorly
researched and. in effect. represents one of
the worst journalistic techniques
sensationalism. This article is air example of
total carelessness. Mr. Iliidges statestliat larii
not currently enrolled at this university. In
liiet. l have been a lull-tune. tax-paying stit-
dciit since September I975. A quick check art
the Registrar's ollicc would have shown this to
be the case. I risk you. the reader. what im-
plicatioits this has lor the atitliciiticity at this
article as a whole‘.’

the overzealous attitude expressed iii-
dieiites iiotliiitg btit irresponsiblejournalism.

tit question. I tltoroughly resent heittg used as
it pawn in the vindictive smear campaign
currently in progress against (iary l’arkcr.

It is really very simple: add it all tip. Sen-
sationiilisrii. poor research. and iiirsrcpreseii-
union of facts spell. in the words of SA Presi-

Why blame
the refs?

To the Editor:

I was one ol'the two referees in the AMIA
lloor hockey game in which Bobl’ape suffered
a serious ncck injury. I wish to know what the
purpose was ol lid Moser‘s article entitled.
“Rel'erceing Called Lax In Hockey." Did Mr.
Moser wish to imply from the title of his arti-
cle. that the rclereeing was in any way respon-
sible for this injury? Such an implication is
totally erroneous.

In his article. Moscr quoted Joe Cafiero of
the Coloiiists. who stated that "there was no
control over the giiittc."

I wish to stiitc that when I detect an iiil'rac-
tioii ol the rules. I' call a penalty. Numerous
penalties were called during the game and
both Ira Gross. the other referee. and I blew
otir whistles Ill order to call a penalty against
ltob lloissy loi' his viciotis. illegal check
against Ilob l’iipc. the irony is that ltad l’ape
restrained liimscll troiti retaliating against
Iloissy. and allowed the i'clct'ecs to administer
the appropriate penalty. his tragic injury
would have been avoided. Instead. llob l’apc
lust t‘HIIII‘Il/ ol his emotions and attempted to
tttcklc lloissy. lliis action caused the horrible
accident w Inch lelt Bob l’iipe with lltrcc
hrokcii \ci'tchl‘ae lll his neck,

Ihtis. there were two lactors which were
directly responsible Ior lloh I'iipe's injury
llob lloissy‘s blatant. illegal check. and Bob
l’apc‘s inability to restrain himself.

Still. one thing continues to pcrplcx iite.
What was lilt' purpose ol l-d Moser‘s tirticlc
L‘IlllliL‘tl. “Relcrceiiig ('iilled lax lti Hockey"?

your letter . . .

To the lidltor:

liittt writing iit response to the letter penned
by John It. llcnrrctt in the l'cb. it issue ol the
ASP. Several points made in his letter
protitpted rite to write this rehuttiil. First.
l’restdettt Carter‘s pardon is not necessarily
setting it precedent tor luture dratls. llcnnett
says that “wars are something dreamers can't
stop." Ilistory makes it clear that soldiers

don‘t stop wars either. l’olitieiaiis start and

end most want. excepting some revolutions.
Tell me howyou can consider a draft resistor
anything but a brave man. He is
putting his conscience ﬁrst. taking an
unpopular (at least among some families)and
illegal stand. Most ofthc draft resistors of the

.middle and late sixties had three choices:

Accept the draft. leave the country. or go to
jail. What a choich /

John. you may feel more sympathetic
towards descrters if you thought about why-so
many ofthcm deserted. It seems to me that a
dcsertcr may be a man who waited too long (ie.
until after induction) to make his choice. In
most other respects. his rationale is similar to
that of the draft resistor; his timing wasjust a
little bit late. I

What are you going to say to a mother who
lost her son'.’ Say, your son died for what he
believed. Draft resistors left their lives behind
lor their belicls. And where were you. Mr.
Bennett. at the lteigltt ofthc Vietnam War »—
postultiting philosophy or playing pinball? If
you were serving your country. accept my
apology lortliese barbs. If itot. empathize with
your past and future Americans; they deserve
at least that.

I not writing It] response to the reeetit letter
by John llciinctt. which concerned itscll with
his opinion ol pardoniitg those who refused to

Mr. llcniictt says Ill his letter that he feels
the war was wrong. bill that he also feels those
who reliiscd to hccotiic involved in the war
were also w roitg. He goes on toask. “what will
happen the nest time we itecd a dralt.“ if the
tlialt resistors are pardoned. M Mr. llennctt
realizes that the war was wrong. he should
rcitli/c. too. that tile United States did not
"need it tlriilt" III the Vietnam situation. When
the country does iii liict Ilt‘t’t/ll draft. I am stirc
that than it ill muster tip a sufficient number ol

finally. Mr. ltcutictl asks those ol US who

The Students Decision ,-
When Central Councilmembers walk into their'm'eetingtomorrow
night, they Will be faced with a decision: Will there-be a referendum

funded? ‘

Council should not try to decide whether or not NYPIRG deserves as
much money as they now receive, though based on past performance,
theie is a good chance they will discuss that very point tomorrow night.
If NYPIRG deserves a separate referendum, then the referendum will
decide the budget question. If not, SA President Steve DiMeo‘s budget
will contain a proposed amount. In either case, there is no reason to‘
argue dollars. ' E *

Council must decide whether NYPIRU is appropriately funded by
student taLmoney. Considering that students once voted to fund
NYPIRG. and that many other schools fund their PIRG's in this
manner. it is clearly appropriate.

Fighting The Fumes

Past cuts at SUNYA have caused alarm and turmoil, but it seems the
administration has finally announced a welcome cutback: cigarette
smoking in classrooms is being phased out.

The first steps will be consciousness raising measures. according to
Vice President of University Affairs Lewis Welch. Signs will be posted in
classrooms. encouraging students to consider the effect that their smok~
ing has on others. The ultimate aim, Welch said, is to bringabout “an at-
titude change that will be sufficient in itself to stop smokih‘g‘Z“

This plan will work only if the signs are supplemented by human
voices expressing similar opinions. It is easy to ignore a sign, but virtual-
ly impossible to shun a spoken request to refrain from smoking.

Changes must be made by the smokers, of course. but one must also
be made by those students who despise the smoke. They must start voic-
ing their objections. Smoking in class has been accepted for so long that
those who complain often lch that they themselves are the offenders. It
doesn‘t have to be that way. Non smokers must speak up for their rights.

If the fumes are annoying, ask the student to move. Cough loudly.

Sigh in disgust. Or. as Al Jaffce suggests. insult tltc person: “Please, feel
it r.‘ to smoke. that sign doesn‘t apply to illiterates."

among the students to determine whether or not NYPIRG will be
