Disabled Veterans:
They Represent War

by David Troeger

During the last week in December I heard
John Chancellor sign-off one of his nightly
newscasts with a short cxtemporaneous com-
ment which struck me. at ﬁrst. a little odd and
perhaps irrelevant duringthesetimes of peace.
He made an appeal on behalf of American
veterans. saying they should be remembered
for what they did for this country.

This vignette was insignificant until ap-
proximately one month later when President
Carter granted his pardon for Vietnam draft
evttdcrs. As a result of Mr. Chancellor's
words. and Mr. Carter‘s pardon. I started
thinking — not about the resistors. the
dcserters. the prisoners of war. but rather the
disabled. I started thinking about those who
went to Vietnam and came back
maimed for life. Why is it we never
hear of them or their plight? They literally
gave of themselves for their country. and they
will be wearing prosthetic devices for the rest
of their lives to prove it.

Whether the Vietnam War was correct or
incorrect doesn't matter: it will not change the
fact that thousands of men live everyday with
the scars of that war. An amnesty may cause
many of us to put the Vietnam War in the past.
Whether we want to or not. a disabled veteran
cannot forget it. There is always a constant
reminder there.

The disabled veteran has a much stronger

 

r-
I

message to deliver than anyone. includingdis-
sidents to the Vietnam War. regarding the im-
morality of war in general. They embody
Sherman‘s adage that "War is Hell." and that
it is not like any of those Hollywood glamor
movies with John Wayne. Kirk Douglas. attd
Robert Mitchum.

The message has always been there from the
disabled veteran ~not until now has that
message been truly heeded. Not untila corrupt
war. with an ambiguous purpose. came along
did we fully see the wrong in allowing men to
lose life and limb. assuming there was no other
course to follow. When the cause was right
the sacrifice Xt’t’lllt'l! justified. We were not
ﬁghting for a great and noble cause in Viet-
nam. so what meaningcould the loss ofancye.
a hand. or a leg havc‘.‘

Subsequently. through questioning and
protest. the very underpinning upon which
our assumptions about warfare were based
crumbled. Because of Vietnam it was possible.
once and for all. to see the stupidity and futili-
ty of war in lull \‘It.‘\\.

Perhaps our generation. and subsequent
ones. will no longer have tofear dislocation by
ottr government to ﬁght for causes in foreign
places, When that day comes. the disabled
\eteran. thanklully. will become an en-
tlangcred species. Until that day. let us not
lorget those who gave of themselves during
our country‘s military endeavors.

The ring says “Class of ‘78" on it. so I gutsy

that means I‘m a junior. | am an i uin
perclassman and I‘m on the way out. It‘s going
too quickly for me. It‘s hard to find time to
look at myself and think of what this college
has done to me—or what I‘ve done to myself.

Being ajunior means I can look back objec-
tively on my freshman and sophomore years.
and at the same time. retain hope for improve-
ment in the time I have left at SUNYA. I
wonder if I have grown in the last three years.
and I wonder what has happened to the people
who grew with me. . . or without me. Where
is the old Fulton Hall crew going? Where will
Joe. Larry and Buzzy be two years from‘now?
l have been affected by many people in this
school and unfortunately. I don‘t see them
anymore. They have left their imprint and
drifted quietly away. At the same time they
leave me to wonder wherethcir impact has left
my lllc.

I like to think that l have grown in the past
three years. both intellectually and socially. l
haw learned to interact with people from out-
side my limited Bayside mentality. I‘m now
able to deal with the Davids from inner New
York City. as well as the Michellcs from small
tou as in western New York. No one will ever
sit on me and punch me in the stomach. no one
will play my stereo when I don't want it on.
and no one will see me run away from a girl I
really like . . . l hope.

For all the change that has occurred. l guess
I‘m still basically the same person. I have the
same fears. anxieties. desires. hopes and
dreams as the freshman me . . . only now I
write about them. I still want to be a doctor. I
still want to be able to party. and to be ap-
preciated for what I am rather than insulted
for what I am not. I can only strive for im-
provement and. in the end. "appreciate"
myself for what I am. Boy. have 1 become

If there is one thing]

esSay it is that yourlifeg
the surrounding environment: The change in
you will occur no matter whois around. Don't
be afraid ornch people. new situations. and
new aspirations. If you're not sure what you
want in life make sure you try everything.
Don't squeeze yourself into a lifestyle which
[can never be you. It is morethan likely you will
ﬁnd what you want if you search hard enough.
At least. I hope so.

This. of course. is only my outlook on life.
Admittedly it sounds much better on paper
than it is in reality. Reachingthis ultimate goal
is hindered by what is elusively knownas your
personality. I always ﬁnd myself either
procrastinating a change. or uneasy. anxious.
and fearful of one. Change. to me;is one ofthe
most ditticult aspects of human existence.
New people. new faces. new situations. and
new conversatiom are very difﬁcult. Ifyou git
in witha positive attitude. however. things will
turn out better than before. “New” is what
college is all about. Nmer in your life will you
have the the rice to expose yourself to so many
new experiences in such a short period oftime.

College has to be more than a place to get an
academic education. If that is all it is to you. it
becomes nothing more than a grandiose waste
ol time. money. and dormitory space. All
colleges. especially this great white monolith.
an: nothing more than what you put into
them. You can spend four years here and. if
you want. the only thing you will get out of it is
a piece of paper that says 3.5. on it. You can
learn about others. others can learn about
you. and most importantly. you can learn
about yourself. Try it it may be an education
that is a hell of a lot of fun.
