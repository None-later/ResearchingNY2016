the Clams' first of the season.

The Colonists. who now have sole

The Danes were. movingthe ball;
,well and hitting the ppen'rnan con-

itantly underneath; evidenced by
their 22 assists on the night. .The
passworlt was exceptional and the
shooting was on target. Albany shot
57% from the ﬂoor as‘a team with
Royal (5 for5). Suprunowicz (5 for
6). and Vic Cesare (7 for l0). leading
the way. Verdejo did another fine job
coming off the bench as be con-
nected on four of ﬁve from the floor
for ten points.

With lZminutesto gointhe game.
Albany led by 20. With four minutes
left they led by 30. And by theend of
the game, the Danes had a 37 point
victory—~thc largest margin of vic-
tory ever at University Gym. No
matter who was sent into the game
by Sauers seemed to do thejob better
than the one before.

Substitute Buddy chklinski. one
of the self-proclaimed “Bomb
Squad" along with Dave Landry. ex-
plained the phenomenon: "When we
got into the game. we were only up
by Iii. And we won by 37. I think
Doc is getting a little more crin-
l'idcncc in us; that we can do thejob.“

()swcgo's Bill Thicbcn played an
excellent game. scoring 19 points
and pulling down a game-high seven
rebounds. Btit it was not nearly
enough to stave off the rampaging
Danes. Albany has won six in a row
and nine of their last ten in up their
record to l4-(i on the year.
