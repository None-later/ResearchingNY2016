~With victories over two. con-.

ference foes at University Gym this
past weekend. the Albany, Great
Danes basketball teamupped their
record to 6-l in the State University
of New York Athletic Conference
and put themselves in a strong pust-
tion to win their ﬁrst SUNYAC title
ever. - v

Facing league-leading Potsdam
Friday night. the Danes won going
away. 74-56. before shellacking 0s-
wegol93-56 the following evening.
Potsdam still leads the conference
with a 7-l record. However. should
both teams win their remaining
SUNYAC contests. Albany would
claim the title by virtue of their win
over the Bears Friday. --~

Barry Cavanaugh began that af-
fair with a side jumper to give the
Danes an early 2-0 advantage. After
Potsdam‘s Jack Bisetta knotted the
score with an offensive rebound and
layup. Albany‘s Vic Cesare tallied
two buckets to open up a four point
lead.

Cavanaugh popped in two more
turn-around jumpers but Bisctta and
Tom Hutchinson offset those with
buckets of their own to make the
score l0-t‘i Albany. Potsdam was usv
ing a l-3—l zone defense while
Albany employed its usual swarming
man-to-man.

uThat was the best defense we‘ve
played against tltis year." Potsdam
coach Jerry Welsh said after the
game. "We didn‘t get it (the ball) in-
side."

Albany was helping out well on
defense and denying the inside pass.
forcing the Bears to shoot primarily

rich then found the range. throwing
upjumpers from far out to score six
of the Bear's next eight points. But it
was not enough to catchthe Danes.

Gary Trevctt tossed in a few foul
line jumpers and with 2:4I left in the
half. Albany had a ten-point lead.
Ulrich connected again but Winston
Royal stole an inbounds pass a mo-
ment later and scored to maintain
the bulge. With l8 seconds remain-
ing. however. Ulrich came up with a
steal and fed Bisetta on a fast-break
pass for a driving layup. Bisetta's en-
suing free throw on the foul sent the
Bears into the lockerroom with only
a seven point deficit. at 35—28.

Potsdam shot 65 per cent in that
half but only got off ZOshots ascpm-
pared to Albany's 34. The l3
Potsdam turnovers also contributed
to Albany‘s advantage.

Bisetta opened up the second half
scoring with a jumper from the top
of the key to cut the Albany lead to
four. But the Danes threatened to
blow the game open when they went
on an ensuing 9-l tear to lead 44-3!
with l7226 remaining in the game.

Grapplers Take Fifth Place

by Eddie Emermln

The Albany State wrestling squad
captured fifth place in the State Un—
iversity of New York Athletic Con-
ference Championships this past
weekend at Oswego State.

Danes‘ head coach Joe Garcia was
pleased with his team‘s performance.
“The kids did one heck of ajob this
tournament." He pointed out that
the team's 24 total points and fifth
place ﬁnish was a marked improve-
ment over last year‘s two points and
last place finish.

individually for Albany. two
wrestlers took second place while
another took fourth.

Berger Takes Second

At I26 pounds. Howie Berger.
seeded second in the tournament.
defeated his first two opponents to
rcachtbc finals. In the championship
match, he faced the number one
seed. Stephen Celia of Brockport

. and was decisioned 11-2. Berger‘s

performance in the tourney im-
proved his record to 14—8.

The other runner-up for the Danes
was third seed Vic Gagliardi. in the
finals. the top seeded Steve
Cavayero, a freshman from
Binghamton. pinned the Danes‘cap-
tain to give him the championship.
For Gagliardi the defeat was his fifth
of the season to go along with his
twenty-one wins.

Garcia felt Gagliardi's semi’final

match may have had an effect on his
final match. “Vic wrestled outstan-
ding and it is probably the best We
ever seen him wrestle." said Garcia
referring to Gagliardi‘s victory over
Scott Hill. He then pointed out that
there wasn't much time betweenthat
match and the ﬁnals and Vic was un-
able to rest as much as he would have
liked to.

In the heavyweight division.
Albany‘s Joe Denn took fourth
place. After losing his opening
match to Brockport‘s Mackey
Tyndall. Denn won two of three
matches in the consolation group to
earn fourth place. Tyndall went onto

was voted outstanding wrestler in
the tournament.

The remainder of the Danes,
however. didn't fare as well. At 150.
Rick Porter. seeded number four.
dropped his opening match to Matt
Ouimei of Binghamton l2-7. Garcia
pointed out that Porter. whoctime to
Albany in January. has been pushed
real hard and recently has gone flat.
Brockport‘s Robert Brenton took
the title at tSO.‘

Albany's Mike Williamson(l§8).
Jeff Aronowitz(l67), Chris
Covas(l77). and Ted Davis( I90) also
lost their opening matches.

The champion at 158 was Cor-
tland’s Rick Lentbo. Rick Van Noy

Potsdam switched to a full-court

But Albany would not let the
visitors come any closer. “I wasn't

Potsdam‘s rally. “I have a lot ofcon-
ﬁdencc in this team and I knew we
could beat them.“

Winston broke the streak with a
layup inside before Royal pumped in
a seven footer to give Albany some
breathing room. at 49-43. TheDane
defense began to assert itself and
allowed the Bears a measly l3 points
for the remainder of the ggme as they
coasted to the victory.

City Sued 1.. Dave   case‘

by Bryan Holzberg

The city of Albany is being sued
for negligence in their enfdrcement
of housing and safety codes by at
least two SUNYA students injured
during a Nov. l7 fire at their 48A
Dove St. apartments.

Attornies for two other SUNYA
students injured in the fire said they
are also investigating the possibility
of bringing similar lawsuits against
the city.

Notice of claims for $25,000 for
Monica Leonards and for $15,000 by
George DeLuca have been ﬁled
against the city by their attorney.
BJ. Costello.

The claims may be the first ever
filed against the city charging city
negligence in the enforcement of
codes as the cause of a fire.

Members of the Coalition for
Effective Code Enforcement. city at-
torney John Roe. and at least one at—
torney for those injured in the Nov.
17 fire said they were not aware of
any previous similar claim ﬁled
against the city in the past.

 

S U N Y A students DeL'uca.
Leonards. Ellen Deutschman. Ralph
l’olk.‘ and Albany ﬁreﬁghter James
vanVorst were all hospitalized with
various injuries resulting from the
fire. and resident Dominick Assaro
was treated and released. '

~ City attorney Roe said the city was
not guilty of negligence as the
Department of Buildings . had
notified owner Michael Rickman
that 48A Dove St. wascurrentlycon-
demned and could not be occupied.
"if we had been notified that the
building was occupied. we would
have vacated the building im-
mediately." said Roe.

Rickman said there was no sign of
comdemnation when he bought the
building. He also bought an adver-
tisement in the Albany Student Press
on Sept. 7 in which he apologized for

said Rubin. “But we've not had a
response to letters. These suits are
within the framework ofa lack of ac-
tion by the city . . . ofa pattern of no
code enforcement."

Roe said he felt anyone who knew
the building was occupied bcforethe
fire and did not report it to the city.
was “as culpable as anyone.“

This is the second eitsc in which an
Albany landlord hits been found
guilty of code violations in recent
years. Rickman was fined $200 in
January for violating a condemna-
tion order and for not providing

Recised Gun Plan Aims

At Arming Night Patrols .

by Thomas Mttrtello '

A revised proposal to authorize
the arming of campus police officers
has been brought before the Univer-
sity Community Council.

The proposal is the second
attempt by University Police to
modify SUNYA's Firearms Policy
this year. in February. tltc Universi-
ty Senate rejected a recommenda-
tion that officers armed on all
inotori/cd patrol iind at the night
desk.

'l be revised proposal calls for the
arming of police officers on nigltt—
timc motorized patrol only.

"I made the new proposal based
upon the objections which were rais-
ed at the University Senate meeting,"
said Department of Public Safety
Director James Williams.

flit: UCC also recommended that
a select committee be set up to review
the effects of the authorization.

“l lie committee would be set up if
the officers are issued the firearms.“
said UCC Chairperson Patricia
Buchaltcr. "it would be given a
year‘s time to review. After that time.
it will give its findings to the UCC
and possibly recommend other
changes,"

Month for Review

’l he recommendations go before
the University Senate. which meets
Monday It) the Assembly Hall. The
Senate will have a month to review
the mattci.

" l he senate won't vote on it until
A pi if.“ said liuchaltcr. “We are subs
tnttttiig information concerning key
aspects of the proposal and the
current Firearms Policy to the
Senate. This will give the senators a
chance to look over the information
attd study the matter."

"it may be a good compromise."
said student Senator lra Zimmer-
man. “We felt thI some increase of

firearms was in order, but not to the
magnitude they were requesting. It
sounds like a good response to the

criticism."

“i Would have preferred the
original proposal." said Williams. "l
happen to disagree with the objec-
tions raised. but this proposal does
meet the onjcctions."

“This policy is easier to swallow."
said student Senator Paul licldmuri.
“l‘m very concerned about small
steps to arms. Is this a delay of a year
to get what thcylllnivcrsity Policcj
ultimately want?"

l‘cldman said that one of the key
advantages to the month rcvtcw time
is that it gives the opportunity to
release information to the student
body. '

"It will be our job to get informa-
tion out to the students." said l‘cld-
man. "Then we can see if we have a
clear mandate from students as to
which [gun] direction to choosg."

UAS Board’s Vote Cans Bottles

by Jonathan Hodges

A plan to convert SUNYA's soda
vending machines from cans to
bottles was scrapped recently when
the UAS Board of Directors voted
overwhelmingly against expanding
the State Quad pilot project campus-I
wide.
. For more than a year. UAS. with
the aid of NYl’lRG. has been ex-
amining the possibility of using
returnable bottles on campus. While
the Board's decision ends the
possibility of a campus-wide bottle

ollvlerl

While a proposal to Institute I cmpuwulde bottle program has been
dropped by UAS. the state cued pilot program may continue.

program. the fate of the project‘s
pilot has yet to he decided. according
‘to UAS President Paul Rosenthai.

“l UAS (icncral Manager II.
Norbert] Zahm and myself have
been conittiissioned by the lloard to
go to State Quad and tryto ascertain
what their opinion is its to retaining
the pilot bottle project." Rosenthai
said. ‘

“There were five things that
strongly affected the Board‘s deci-
sion." said UAS'Iloard of Directors
Cary Klein. “The failure of the State
Legislature to act on NYPlRG's bill
on returnable bottles was primary. If
it was a state law. our soda dis-
tributor would be better equipped to
handle bottles.“

Klein cited cost. apathy. the local
Coca-Cola distributor's lack of sup-
port. and the amount of machines
UAS would have to buy or lease as
four other major factors.

“It‘s a great idea. a noble idea."
said SA President Steve DiMco.
"We should change to bottles; we are
a very wasteful society. generally
speaking.“ However. foriltis campus
to dish out 40 or 50 thousand dollars
for storage space fdr tltc bottles, to
constantly lake losses. is something
that the corporationjust can not do.
For those reasons I find to volt: no."

The pilot program began last year
after NYPIRG suggested UAS
switch from the present bi—metallic
cans to returnable bottles. After ex-
amining NYPIRG‘s proposal. UAS
agreed to set up the pilot program on
State Quad.

"l was very much appalled at th
lobbying tactics that NYPIRG
used." said DiMeo. “The way they

could sit there and practically accuse
every one of us of being narrow-
minded and anti-environmentalists.
Everyone there was philosophically
in favor of returnable bottles. bttt the
facts showed that we really couldn't
take the loss."

“We tried to ltelp solvcthe various.
problems that arose." said NYl’l R(I
at SUNYA Chairman Kevin Kovac.
"We offered alternatives but they
were rejected. The empty bottles
need not have been stored in a
climate controlled area. while lull
bottles could be placed in the Cam-
pus Center."

With the end ofthe bottle project.
various alternatives are now being
examined in rccyclingthc bi-metallic
cans presently in use or the possibili-
ty of using aluminum cans.

“Right now. at this end of, the
country. aluminum cans aren't
available." said Zahm. "We‘ve asked
Coca-Cola to consider the possibili—
ty of aluntinum cans here as a good
alternative to returnable bottles and
they said that they would. Obvious-
