to ask resident assistants to" report

Aceording to Farley. the high
crime rate on campus is “due to the
drug subculture. [Student] dealers
are being victimized because they are

When asked what she thought
about RA‘s reporting studentstothe
local authorities for possession of
the drug. Farley stated. “Anyone
’who has responsibilities. has the
responsibility for the climate and
tone of the wing."

Haskins noted that in a recent
development the policy‘ has been
loosened. “On Monday the Office of
Student Affairs asked that thc RA‘s
report only blatant usage. not all
