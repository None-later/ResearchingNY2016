Students. has been advisertoforeign
students at SUNYA for ﬁftem years.

His and othEr foreign'studeut ad-
visory'positions 'have been
eliminated by the NYS legislature in
the l976—l977 ﬁscal budget. SUNY
at Buffalo. Stony Brook. and
Oneonta have been similarly
affected.

“I havs great fears for what's going
to happen next year without an ad-
visor.“ said International Student
Association l‘resident Barry
Krawchuk. “Right now there's
Sayles International Housc(a down-
town dormitory). but we lost our
director. We used to have a person
over in admissions. but he was let go
last year.“

“I think it'll be damaging to
foreign students on campus." ex-
pressed Krawchuk. “Dr. Wark
solves so many problems. A person
by himself really can't go anywhere.
You need someone with that ex-
perience."

“For exam ple. if a foreign student
applies for food stamps unwittingly.
he can be deported. A foreign stu-
dent who comes to this campus goes
first to see Dr. Ward.“

“1 don't think there‘ll be foreign
students for very long here." said
Krawchuk.  ‘

“The problem of the reduction of
this office is going to (seriously
affect) the continuation of the
(SUNYA program“. voiced Ward.
“We never really got a full
background study as to why these
lines were cut."

According to Ward. the university
has "legal obligations in admitting
and maintaining these students. “In
essence". he said. “the Federal
Government ‘Iiccnscs‘ any university
to admit foreign students."

The International Student Office
sends prc-arrival information to in-
coming students. along with infor-
mation about customs and obtaining
visas. On arrival the students attend
an otientation program. There is
also community orientation and an
optional host family program co-
sponsered by the Albany Inter-
national Center.

“We assist off-campus students
with housing.” said Ward. “We assist
with ﬁnancial problems. personal
counseling. and in the event of
repatriation. this office has complete
responsibility. In other words. we

, “I‘m really not at libertytot'ell‘you

said. 'flthink this campus is com-
mitted to maintain it foreign student
,.. , even-thouglithc legislature
is cutting the funds to maintain it."
rVStilI; Ward said.‘ “generally the
future of foreign students will bethat

the declining enrollment across the "

country will increase. Foreign
students are becoming more attrac-
tive. . i

"The students are valuable. They
participate in class discussions for-
mally and informally. We get re-
quests from schools. churches. and
civic clubs to have students come
down and talk.“

"You have people who can be in-
vited to speak in classes." Krawchuk
agreed. stressing. "It‘s not a library
resource. It's II real resource.“

“We have students t'rom'all over
the world» 50 to 62 countries
represented every year.“ Ward

Vto c ntribute.

‘e’laborate‘d. “The board 'of Trustees

' has encouraﬁd foreign students to ‘

come -to SUNY in the form of
providing tuition waiver
scholarships for those in-need.
“Therole of the foreign student
has been important. I thinkyou‘d
iindrithat a sizable majority of our
out-of-state students are foreign
students." . '1 .' " ‘ -
»"I think maybe they’d like to feel
more 'important.". mentioned
Krawch‘uk. “They feel they have a lot
There‘s a great

satisfaction in feeling they have I Z

something to give."

“They‘re treated normally. but_

there‘s a vacuum. too.“ he con-
tinued. "On International Night.
they would like everybody in the
whole university id be there. It can
be pretty discouraging to see a lack
of interest.“

There were no budget or line cuts
overseas or in the exchange
programs. according to Directorof
Internationttl Programs Charles
Colman. "The Master Plan for
SUNY as a whole for the next four
years singles out International
Education as one of the areas to be

supported. The something is true for
our own Mission Statement.“

“As for our programs overseas.
they're all going very well and we've
added a new one with the Soviet
Unionﬁ Moscow State University.“
Colman commented. "It looks very
promising for increasing very sub-
stantially the number of students

we‘re sending over. In the summer nl
I978 we hope to have an additional
ISO to 200 studying overseas.“

Currently approximater 200
Albany students study abroad each
year. The increase would be due in
part to art expanded Israel program
and new opportunities in I'zirts.l nn-
don. and other cities.

LIVING DEAD ,
*One of the nation's pioneer
researchers on the subject of death
and dying is now reporting that she
was visited by the spirit of a dead

patient nine years ago. "
Doctor Elizabeth Kubler‘Roas,
who last year attracted nationwide
attention when she announced she
believed. there was life after—death.
says she dismissed the incident at the

time as a hoax or hallucinations

Since then. however. the doctor
reports she has become convinced
that it was a “spontaneous
materialization" of somebody who
had died almost a year before the in-
cident occurred. Kubler-Ross says
the incident occurred at a time when
she was seriously considering giving
up her years of research with ter-
minally ill patients.

The doctor reports that a woman
suddenly appeared in her office. and
introduced herself as a patient who
had died 10 months earlier‘. and
pleaded with Kublcr-Ross to not
quit her research. The visitor. the
doctor says. looked identical to the
former patient.

LAW OF‘THE LAND

if you think that there are so many
laws around these days that you
could be busted for almost anything.
you could be right.

A report in Parade magazine tells
us that crocodiles may not be tied to

According to Parade. these are
just a few of the old laws on the
books in the U.S. that chronic low
abiders must be aware of. Other
statutes to watch out 'for are in
Floride. for instance. where the law
requires keeping your clothes on

USED HUSBANDS

Majority Roporl. a New York
women's newspaper. is offeringa un-
iquc service to its female readers.
The publication‘s classified adver—
tising section is out with a “Used

the former husband‘s first name and
last initial. and then some ofthe least
endearing qualities of the adver-
tiser's ex-mate.

The paper states it cameup with
the idea because “Every woman who
has lived with a man knows
something about him that should. in
the spirit of feminist solidarity. be
passed on to his next victim.”0ne of
the latest entries reads like this:

Ward pointed out that if there is
not one full professional per 200
students. an extra burden will be
placed on the existingstaff. “Clearly
word will get around—“Go to
Albany or Buffalo or Stony Brook
and you‘ll have to fend for

Student Affairs Dean Neil Brown
said. “We are satisfied that there will
be a foreign student advisor next
year. My intention is not to
deteriorate the program any
further."

As a result of last minute legisla.
