isn’t there
any justice?

To the Editor:

I. as a citizen of the United States of
America. laugh at the concept and practice of
justice in this country. I refer specifically to the
recent sentencing of Larry Flynt. publisher of
Hustler magazine. I laugh because a
newspaper heiress convicted of kidnapping
and armed robbery has drawn the same
sentence — seven years. I hope the puritan-
minded. the “born-again". and all other
crusaders for literary repression are happy
with their pound of ﬂesh. i am offended that
this abortion of justice was allowed in my
country. I would consider it foolish and ig-
norant of anyone to maintain that there is
equaljustice for all. in light ofthis recent deci-
sion. I state again; Larry Flynt. whose sole in-
fraction was the distribution of a magazine
deemed obscene. drew the identical prison
sentence as Patty Hearst. convicted bank
robber and heiress to a sizable newspaper for-
tune. I have my doubts as to whether or not
Mr. Flynt's father can buy his son out of
prison as Randolph Hearst did for his ex-
uberant daughter.

Larry Flynt sits in his Columbus. Ohio
prison cell while Claudine Longet receives a
thirty day prison term and Bernard
Bergmann. the owner and operator ofcorrupt
old—folks homes. receives a four-month prison
sentence (suspended). In my opinion, the
operation of these old-folks' homes is almost
as forgivable as the operation of Dachau. I cite
the case of John N. Mitchell, our “law-and-
order" attorney-general. (who was going to
lasso every hippie before sundown). I cite the
case of Spiro Agnew. otrr talkative ex-vice-
president. who was just eloqtrent enough to
plead “no contest" at his trial for tax evasion. I
cite the case of ll. R. Haldemrin. the
president‘s top aide. who abused his power as
deftly as any (iesttipo Chieftain. And ofcourse.
there's oitr own Charles |. Richard Nixon.
He‘s suffered enough. hasn't he‘.’ flow can a
nation tolerate his pardon for the rape ofthe
Constitution. yet balk at the pardon of the
men who refused to fight an undeclared war'!
What would possess people to cry out for the
death of (iriry (iiltnore while Claudine Longet
gets a ship on the hand for nearly the same

‘ crime? Money may not buy happiness. but it

   

sure buys justice. I cite these cases and

decisions as crimes against the American peo- .

ple. None of the aforementioned Watergate.

-SLA. or Aspen criminals will serve a day in

prison. Our justice is not only blind. it's
obscene as well. This brings us back to the case
of Larry Flynt. There‘s no doubt about it —
his magazine is raunchy. But if justice is to be
carried out. Hus/[er isn't the place to start.

practice makes
perfect

To the Editor:

In it college of approximately fifteen thou-
sand people. there are hound to be a handful
who play musical instruments. This college
has practice rooms available in the PAC for
those who piay the piano, cello. saxophone.
and flute. How about those who play electric
guitars and basses. electronic keyboards. and
most important. those who play the drums?
These unfortunate people are left without any
place to practice. As any person knows. prac-
tice is extremely important in maintaining
your proficiency in an instrument. Those who
play electronic instruments and drums have to
give up their practice in lieu of their dorm-
mates. We have tried to secure practice areas
in the PAC. but the rooms seem to be open
only to those who are music majors. Anyway.
there is no locked area where expensive
amplifiers can be kept.

On a campus as big as ours. there must be
some kind of storage 'pace that isn‘t being
used. If the adrnini ration would let
musicians utilize this space. a lot ofproblcms
could be solved. Right now. there is one band
that is lorrning on State Quad and their prac-
tice time is limited to two hours on Saturday
afternoon. This is ridiculous! No band can be
expected to become decent with so little
rehearsal time, lhink of all the musicians in
this situation. l'here are at lot of musicians on
all quads who are aching to form bands and
play some good music. Unfortunately. they
are left in this predicament which has not yet
been I‘CSOht‘d.

Right now. l have my entire drtrm set
assembled in my suite room. llesides taking up
the whole suite room. it disturbs my entire
suite and dorm. What can I do‘.’ i have the right

to practice. even if it's only fora goddam half-
hour a day. So far. all of the musicians on
State Quad have been pretty nice about the
whole ordeal. Quiet hours state that any
amount of noise can be generated between the
hours of seven in the morning and eleven at
night. We could be bastards about the whole
thing and tell the quad directors to fuck off
because we have the right to make noise. But
we don't. We realize that electronic in-
struments create a lot of noise, so we're willing
to make sacriﬁces for the comfort of the quad.
But this can't go on for long. Just think of how
many bands would sprout if musicians were
given a place to practice.

Our only solution is the publication ofthis
letter. We hope someone in the administrative
hierarchy reads this and acts. There are areas
under the podium which are probably empty.
The I’AC also has their responsibility to ltclp
out the musicians of this campus. lfthis situa-
tion is resolved. it would spare a lot of grief
and a lot of noise.

' ()n October 22. I976. I went to the infirmtiry
with an ingrown toenail and was referred to iii-
l'irmtiry specialist. Dr. Marcus Einhorn. l
returned to him on five occasions in the
course of the following three weeks.

liach time I visited Dr. Einhorn. he applied
two liquids and gave me a prescription for an
ointment. I returned in December complain-
ing of great pain in conjunction with my now
infected toe and ingrown toenail. |)r. liinltorn
prescribed .lfl I'crramycin and told me that it
would help stop the pain and heal the tire. I
should come back in January. ('l'erramycin is
a broad spectrum a titibiotic with many of'thc
same characteristics as Tetracycline.)

I returned to the infirmary in January. At
that time my toe was badly infected. the nail
was ingrown on both sides. and l was in great
pain. At this time. Dr, liiiihorii admitted that
he could not heal the toe and referred me to it
specialist in Albany. liarly iii February. l)r.
Van ()rdcn of Albany performed surgery on
the ntiil. totally removing if. life entire three
and one half" month ordeal caused me weeks
of extreme pain rind a financial indebtedness

' of fifty dollars for fees and medication.

What is your opinion of the type of medica
attention the SUNYA students receive? Ar
we getting what we pay for? Are we gettin
what we need? Let the inﬁrmary know how
you feel, and write Dr. Janet Hood. in care of
the SUNYA infirmary.
