By ALAN ALPER /

Later it seems that the “good ole days" of
classiﬁcation of contemporary music are
gone. A new album entitled “Beaverteeth”. by
a group of the same name apparently rein-
forces this notion. Their music spans many
different genres. While based on southern
boogie music. much of their sound is of rock
and blues origin. Unfortunately. many of the
tunes are a little on the commercial side. yet
some of the songs contain very catchy beats
which saves the album from flopping badly.

The band consists of Rodney Justo on lead
vocals and guitar who has sung with Roy
Buchanan and most recently with The Atlanta
Rhythm Section. David and John Rainey are

the group‘s lead guitarist's. and do most of the

harmonies well placed. The finest part
out is the superny arranged orchestration,
"Where No Man's Been before". is the
shortest yet maybe the“ best cut. on thealbum.
It combines strong vocals with a perfect blend
of swing and blues to emit an easy listening
sound. The musicians shine as this song dis-
plays the band's tight musical structure. This
becomes evidentin' the beautiful melodic in-
terplay between guitar and piano. The ending
is performed with class and adds a good touch
to the group's best composition. ‘
. “Sing For You“. which opens the second
side is the best orchestrated cut on the album
on an In which contains much of this treat-
ment. The song epitimizes the performers
classic urge to be on stage. “. . . to make some
music and some money too.“ The band inter-
jects a humorous interlude by goofing on the

 

The Classical Forum

The editorial page of the Knicker-
bocker News of February 2, 1977,
featured an article by James J. Kilpatrick
on the subject of “Socialism by lndircc-
tion.“ Mr. Kilpatrick comments on a
study of federal regulations pertaining to
the iron and steel industry ofthis country;
such a study was recently released by the
Council on anc and Price Stability.
This rather dull book. in Mr. Kilpatrick's
view. demonstrates “thc slow triumph of
socialism over a major American in-
dustry." brought about by the Fabian tac-
tics of federal authority. Fabian refers to
the Fabian Society of Great Britain. and
that society in turn derives its name from
a Roman gcncrul named Quintus Fabius
Muximus. Mr. Kilpntrick points out.

Q'uintus Fnbius Maximus belonged to
a distinguished patricizm family and ac-
quired much fame and honor by his own

accomplishments. He was consul in 233
B.C.. censor in 230, and consul again in
228. In 217. the second year ofthe Second
Punic War. when the Romans had
already suffered three bad defeats at the
hands of Hannibal and the consul Baius
Flnminius had been killed in battle.
Fabius was clcctc'd dictator. (In the con-
text ol'thc Roman Republic this term has
no odious connotations.) He held the
consulship again in 2|5. 2|4. and 209.
His military strategy was one of attri-
tion. exhaustion. and harassment. rather
than of pitched battlc. This policy was not
popular but in the end it was successful.
The Romans culled Fabius thc Cuncmmr
(Dclnycr). first in ridicule but soon as a ti-
tlc of honor. The poet Ennius honored
him thus: “One man by delaying has sav-
cd our state.“ Ftibius died in 203 BC. and
thus was not allowed to witness the final
triumph of Roman arms over Hannibal.
The Fabian Society is a socialist society
founded by British intellectuals in I884.
George Bernard Shaw was one of its most

Fabius and the Fabiaris

famous members. The society advocates
the establishment of a socialist system
through the methods of political
democracy and an evolutionary process
rather than by revolution. Thus in its
basic ideology it differs substantially
from socialist movements in the tradition
of Karl Marx.

The Fabians helped to establish the
British Labor Party when they found it
difficult to permeate the Liberal Party
and the Conservative Party with their
ideas. They count among their ranks
many lciidcrs of the Labor Party and
many Labor members of the House of
Commons.

Like the Roman gcncrnl whose name
they adopted. the Fnhinns pursue their
objectives gradually and patiently but
with dctcrmination and candor.
Somehow it scents not quite fair to apply
the term Fabian to thc “creeping
socialism“ which stems from the ever-
growing power of our federal
bureaucracy.

fight the oil companies and government
policies favoring them will work in the
end. We must light. not by accepting
austerity and tightening our belts more
and more until there‘s nothing left. but by
demanding that industry meet our needs.
and by backing up those demands with
our mouths. and'tvith our bodies. and
with our collective power.
What can we do about it?
