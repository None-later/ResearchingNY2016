this is a reﬂection of how much concern
AMIA has for bowling. I think that if it had
been a basketball team plans would have been
made in the event their games were held. Last
year there were problems with the ACU trip
also. We again went on the RPI bus and some
participants took cars due to luck of space. We
found ourselves in two separate hotels——
across town from our fellow students.

I can't help but feel that this lack of concern
is a poor reﬂection on our school. It upsets me
to see this happen. I suppose nothing can be
done. All I can hope is that AMIA will get
themselves together enough to show some
concern for all sports. and that the problems
and disappointments we fticcd this your will
not be repealed.

combination of words yet to bc uttcrcd in

machines. evolution has pointed the way to
the solution ofmun‘s currcnt dilcmmn ofovcr-

it. chds could be hcods. swingers could bc
swingers. Amcricnn Legionntiircs could he
Atticricun chionmtircs. When someone tired
of being with one group. they could go on to :1
different lrip. Not only would we have the
l'rccdom to do Wlllll we want. we would have
the freedom to do without what we do not
want! "The technology is there." quotes
Timothy of NASA scientists. “till we Inivc to
do is contend with public opinion." As Iscc it.

ch. Timothy Leary has undergone ii
metamorphosis. and now returns to us. not to

Thank you Timothy. for bringing these words

Canning Bottles r J

Once again, the noblcr inclinationsof man are subverted by his
shortsighted materialistic needs. In other words, it looks like the bottle
project just ain’t gonna make it.

It’s unfortunate that one of the largest institutions of higher learning
in northeastern New York State cannot muster enough strength to pull
its chin above the state law; that it cannot see fit to take the lead on this
returnables issue. Traditionally, the university is .a progressive
institution — it should not sit back and wait for the state to take action
on an issue so central to the environmental cause.

Perhaps the UAS board objected to being called “narrow-minded
anti-environmentalists." Perhaps the cost of converting to and
maintaining bottles really is outlandisth prohibitive. But those are ~
arguments for the real world; they should have no place in the free-
thinking, idealistic confines of the university. Political and financial
arguments should come from Coca-Cola. not UAS.

Strangely enough. after canning bottles for the rest of the campus.
UAS has decided to allow the residents of State Quad to decide whether
or not the pilot project on State will continued.

Why only State? Why not let the 15.000 months on this campus who
consume all that soda decide exactly how they‘re going to consume it?
Rcl'crcndums seem to be popular these days, eliciting the voice of the
people in accordance with the foundations of democracy upon which
this great land—«and its even greater university system—rest.

The bottle project could be one more of the many money losers now
bencvolcntly subsidized by UAS‘s more profitable operations: another
Check Cashing, solo speak.

“It‘s at great idea. a noble idea. . .cvcryonc there was philosophically
in favor of rcturnziblc bottles." said SA President Steve DiMeo. member
of the UAS Board of Directors. about the State Quad returnable-bottle
experiment. Yet. in the final vote. the board was unanimoust opposed
to vending returnable bottles campus-wide.

The university is supposedly a haven from the pragmatism and
materialism of the rczil world. one ofthc few places left where the flame
of idcnlism can still burn bright. It may be asking 21 lot. but it would be
nice to scc the philosophical win out over the fiscal just once.
