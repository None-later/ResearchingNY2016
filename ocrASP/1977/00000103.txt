by Jettrey Scsrdlno ‘

A One of the most sclimactic and controver-

sial problems» presently facing ‘SUNYA is
Whether or not to continue its present system
of busing or change to that of the Capital Dis-
trict ‘Transit Authority (CDTA,. This action
has been proposed by CDTA for some time
now. When it first appeared on the SUNYA
agenda. it was believed to be some time before
the green buses were ever replaced. When the
CDTA submitted a tempting bid to SUNYA
for the privilege to bus the students and the
staff. the possibility of a chttngc was more
.realislic. The logic behind this possibility is
that it would be cheaper to contract another
system of buses rather than to finance the
repairs and purchases of new buses.
" What would happen if CDTA took over?
What are the proposals of the CDTA? What
tire the advantages and disadvantages of the
CDTA takeover? What happens to the ex-
isting bus drivers? These and other questions
must be trnchred ifscrious consideration is to
be given to the CDTA project.

Presently. SUNYA contracts otrt ol its cx~
isting busing organization approximately
$325,000 per year to bus students on a fixed
ﬁ'chcdltlc. This is not counting the SIXSU that

' As was mentioned in the ASP, the routes

traveled by the CDTA buses will deviate ,

somewhat from the existing routes. This
would mean an inconvenience to students
traveling from Alumni Quad. ~

Early feedback from the, CDTA includes,

their discontent with demands by SUNYA
and SA for minimum busing service for
students. 2

Students would be required to present their

ID. before boarding the bus. The CDTA lies '

expressed.in passing. the possibility of some
other distinguishable factor instead of the
valid SUNYA ID. card. '

The CDTA has based its bid on the amount
per rider for so many miles traveled. This is the

same rationalization the existing bus system .

uses for their bid. The big difference is their
cutback of service to the residents of Alumni
Quad and other SUNYA students;

The various problems faced by the many
downtown residents are numerous. They
would be riding on the same bus with local
commuters. This could mean. at peak hours.
only a small percentage of SUNYA students

could ride on the bus. The buses could already .

be near full capacity with private citizens. The
possibility of personality conflict could exist
among the amalgamation of occupants. This
in turn could cause a breakdown in communi-
ty relations of the private residents who would
UllllIL' the bus route.

Why does the possibility exist that CDTA
will take ovcr‘.’ The answer is in conjunction
with the concept of cconornizing to the fullest
amplitude conceivable. The cost of refrairing
the existing buses or purchasing new ones
would be dear in the long-run.

The opposition of the students is now being

SUNYA and, the State of New York-an ad->/'

ditional amount to train them. Their jobs as
bus drivers can only be compensated by some
other type of employment. for the state. or for
SUNYA. ,

The general consensus, of opinion from
many of the downtown residents is total dis-
content and dissatisfaction. Comments ofthe
situation were expressed by Alumni Quad
Board President. Sue Sokol. and.SA Presi-
dent Steve DiMco. DiMeo said. “there still
exists a considerable amount of distance
between us (SA) and CDTA.“ DiMco con-
cluded his remarks on a positive note. “lThink
with our meetings. some satisfaction could
result.“ Miss Sokol expressed her discontent
on the situation. She said. "it is'not logical to
assume CDTA would be of any advantage to
the downtown residents.“ Miss 50an goes on
to advocate support from ttptown residents.
“This will have an effect on all of us in sortie
way. Evert if this takeover doesn‘t directly
affect uptoth residents. in the long run it will
cripple cvcryone's ability to ride the buses.“
Hello CDTA. or (ioodbye Green Machines.
That is the question.
