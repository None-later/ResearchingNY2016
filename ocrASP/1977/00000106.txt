Suprunowicz single-handcdly broke
the game open by scoring ten points

Up until Suprunowtcz‘s lloor

favored Danes more than tlicycould

first half. forcing them toshoot from
outside while effectively containing
their inside passing game.

Saucrs asserted afterward that the
Dutchmen's and Onconta‘s defenses
were "the two best that we played
against all year."

“They‘re not a |0<|3 team." said
Suprunowicz. “They're very

Bad Checks Cost UAS

by Kathleen (Henson

UAS loses about $3500 a year in
bad checks. according to General
Manager E. Norbert Zahm.

Since Sept. I976. fraudulent cllcck
writers have run up a bill of over
$9800 for checks and $2llXt for ser-
vice charges.

“This figure does not rcprcscpt the
total amount of bad cheeks passed
most are redeemed." Znhnl said.
"ilut we still keep the service lip ill
spite ol'this because it‘s very valuable
to students. We cllsli anywhere from
7(llt lo Lilli) checks per day. so it's
obliously a big service."

He said that olit of the ap—
proximately |4(l.ilil() checks cashed
per year. there are now 420 bad ones
accumulated since September which
lime not been paid.

liccllusc UAS caslics such a large
number ol checks. labm said that
there is "a tremendous risk ol taking
bud checks. We take checks from vir-
tually anyone with a University l.l).

We've looked at a number ofsystems
to control the intake of bad checks.
but the more control you exert. the
tnorc expensive it is. and there's still
no way to tell if the customer has
money in the bank."

For customers who pass a bad
clleck. UAS policy is first. to resub-
mittlie check to the bank if it is
marked “insufficient funds".

“This gives the student a chance to
rcllli/e he's made a mistake. alid we
don‘t have to begin the collection
process right away.“ Zahm said.

it the check comes back a second
time. UAS sends a letter to the
customer telling them to pay the
check. The customer also receives a
letter from his book. A hold is put on
the student‘s records until illc debt is
paid.

Action Is Expected To Be
Taken Against Beneclce

by Thomas Mlirteilo

A "definite decision" has been
made and action is expected to be
taken against former Class of '78
President Marc Benecke. probably
by the end of the Week. according to
University Police.

In November. Benecke was

suspended for IS months from.
SUNYA for the alleged theft of
$3000 from the Class of '78 while he
was president. The University Police
have been conducting an investiga-
tion into the case since the suspen-
sion.
“i cannot release any specific in-
formation." said Dept. of Public
Safety Director James Williams.
“We will have something by the end
of the week."

i "The Albany County District At-
torney and the investigating staff
have met and made a'definite deci-
sion and primary course of action
will be taken.“ said Dept. of Public
Safety Assistant Director John
Benighan.

Beneclte has agreed to pay full
restitution in monthly $200 in-

 

stallments which began in January.
According to Dean of Student Af-
fairs Neil lirown and present Class of
‘78 President Tim. Burton, Beneckc
has paid the first two installments.

"The January payment came a
week early and the February pay-
ment was also on time." said Burton.
The payments were made by per-
sonal transaction checks from it New
York City bank. said Burton.

Taking Courses

“My understanding is that he‘s
working full time in New York City
and that he is paying for it himself."
said Brown. “i believe he also might
be taking it few courses downthere."

Burton said that the checks receiv-
ed “appeared to be his own account.
with his own name on them."

The original Class of :78 deficit
was reported in September as nearly
S4400 by UAS.

“The original deficit was above the
amount ile ball to pay." said Brown.
“How much of that deficit was at-
tributed to 'Bcncckc vs. general
overspending of the class was a
prime question."

Assistant to the President Robert

The pltln to convert the tid—

at a meeting ol'tlle School of liducao

Shirley is Director of Planning
and information Systems on campus

been closed or a stop payment it
issued carry a $l0 service charge per
check. The same holds trite with
students who have passed lliore than
one “insufficient funds" check. ac-
cording to Zahm. ‘

These people are “referred im-
mediately to the student court. If
- that doesn‘t work. we goiothe police
depllrtmcnt to sign a warrant for
their arrest. or refer the case to a
national collection agency.“ Zalml
said. ‘ g

l his is because ill these cnsestllcre
is "without too much question
ctideilce of fraudulent intent." ac-
cording to Director of the Dept. oi
l’ublic Salcly James Williams.

“ There are students that use UAS as-

a lrce loull service. They soon find
out they can‘t: everybody we con»
tactcii either paid or was arrested."

process." anlm said. "Some of the
students have graduated lllld could
br anywhere. lll these cases. we use
the collection agency. it‘s an expen-
sive process to go through. It‘s still
working. but obviously our methods
aren't effective enough."

The preventive controls in effect
now are: a cashier's list of bad check
pusscrs who are ineligible to use tile
service; requiring customers ‘to
produce a University LD. card; and
encouraging students to use the
Bank Kcy system. which is available
to students who have a checking ric-
count with the NationalCommcrcial
Bank (NCB). according to SA presi-
dcnt Steve DiMeo. who is also it
member ofthe UAS Board of Direc-
tors.

SA vice-president and UAS Board
of Directors member Gary Parker
feels that the lists and the Bank Key
are not as effective as they could be
in preventing bad checks.

“The Bank Key is supposed to
reduce bad checks because actually
you are deducting money from your
bank account right then and there."
Parker said. Whether or not one has
sufficient funds to cover the check is
determined immediately.‘

“But there's still a 25 cent service
charge. Because of it. there is no iii-

"There were quite a few objecy
lions." said Shirley. "We‘re working
with the advisory council of the
School of Education llnd had our
first meeting with them this past l-'ri-
day. They‘re raising legitimate
questions about how the decisions
were made."

The committee ilid foresee
problems during the ﬁrst year of the

centive for students to use the Bank
Key."

The Blink Key isa UAS project. in
conjunction with the NCB. The 25
cent service charge goes to UAS and
not to the NCB. aeeorditig to NCB
employee Robert J. Branley.

Zahm said the Bank Key is
"almost foolprool“ for those with ac-
eounts at the NCB. but it does not
solve the bad checks problem
because "anyone who wants to write
a bad check will use the regular ser-
vice and not the Bank Key."

Parker also said he thought the
cashiers did not usually look at the
bad check writers' list before cashing
checks.

The cashiers had no comment.
Zaltm said that UAS “made a review
ofhow well they look at the list. They
miss about 65 people per year who
are on the list. Considering the
number of people on the list
(Williams estimated it at about 200)

they do a very good job in weeding,

out the bud checks."
Part of this. Zahm claimed. is due
to the fact that. on the list. “the same

names keep coming up all the time.
and it's easy to memoriie them."

Parker sliid be had proposed that
UAS install it computer terminal
that would instantly identify bad
check writers.“ but it was written off
its too costly."

“i don‘t know what more we can
do to slow down the problem,"
Zahm said. lie is planning to try an
undisclosed method of collection in
the future. “We still take the risk of
cashing bad checks. and the risk is
getting greater every year."
