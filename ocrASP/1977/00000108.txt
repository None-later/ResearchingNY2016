‘ The Executive Budget for l977-78
takes the University to the edge of
what is manageable. Although anin-
crease in State tax dollars is provid-
ed. the total support available to the
Univeristy is essentially the same as
the current Very tight year. with no
provision for inflation.

The decreitsc insupportofthe Un-

coupled with this year‘s austerity
budget. means that the State Univer-
sity of 'New York is diminished in the
students it conserve. in the services it
can provide to the public. and in the

new knowledge it can create. The .

University can no longer afford to
admit the students who seek to
enroll. As a result. some who are
denied admittance will be denied a
college education.

The Board expresses its deepest
concern about the following conse-
quenccs of the Executive Budget:

be able to cope with additional

of managerial flexibility and plan to
use-it‘well. " ‘_  ‘

For the . Univeriilty, ﬂexibility .j
means the ability to transfer money
and personnel lines from one activity
to another within available support
levels;- To serve the public well. it is
critical that each campus ad-
ministration be allowed to respond
creatively to changing conditions.

We therefore appreciativcly .
acknowledge the fairness“ and
wisdom in the recent decision to
return a signiﬁcant portion of funds
to the campuses which result from
theUnivcrsity‘s successful evergy
conservation programs. This is an il-
lustration of creating an incentive
for continued efficiency. and of the
University‘s capacity to serve itself
and the State‘s fiscal rcquircmcutsat
the same time.

And we could do more. except for
the vacancy freere. This free/c is in-
creasingly damaging. In the early
stages of the freeze. the essentially
random effect of losses was
manageable: but as the freeze con-
tinues. and vacancies accumulate.
our ability to direct our own ac-
tivities erodes. To continue to meet
budgetary goals by retaining vacant
positions. rather than by planning.
prevents us from providing the
educational opportunities our funds
allow. The University would be
much better able to serve the public
if the l‘reeve was lifted while our ex-
penditures continue to be controlled.
We are not scekingadditional funds;
we are requesting relief from a
regulation that is damaging to the
University and in no way helps the
State.

The Executive Budget proposes
significant changes in the financing
of Community Colleges for I977-78.
We' are pleased that this Budget
proposes to retain the open-door ad-
missions policy to Community
Colleges. docs not require program
reduction. and does not require ad-
ditional college support from local
tax sources in spite of a State aid
reduction for I977-7li.

The Executive Budget proposes
that this reduction in State aid be
made up from funds availablc'in the
reserves for excess student revenues
and from fund balances where suf-
licicnt funds are held in these ac-
counts.

For some colleges the application
of reserves may be accompanies by
reductions in local support because
some sponsors had made plans to
utiIi/e some of the surplus in lieu of
sponsor support. We strongly urge
this not be the case. and that the
reduction in State aid. if necessary.
he a one-time occurrence in order to
protect the open enrollment concept
and avoid program retrenchment.

We must also note that in some
cases the use ol the accrued reserves
in lieu iii a portion of Stale aid is
viewed as a negative incentch by
those who have carefully limited
their expenditures. Ihe fact is that
where no reserves have accrued there
will he no loss in State aid funding.

We are pleased that the Executive
Budget has been amended to reduce
the loss of State aid and to make
allowance for the college use of
reserves which had been priviously
scheduled for use in the 1976-77
operating budgets.

The Executive Budget further
recommends that a lull-scale review
of the Community College funding
formula be undertaken. For several
years State University has rccogniy-
ed some of the deficiencies of the for-
mula and will be pleased to
cooperate in the development of it
new Iormula.

Alihoiigh 'IAI’ is not part of the
University‘s budget. we must con-
cliidc that the current proposals for
change will increase out-of—pockct
expenditures for the necdicst
students. This would be a socially
rcgrcxshc action which we llll-
ii unnotist oppose. I

()l the recommended changes in
the Program. the proposal to reduce
1 Al’ payments by Sllltl for each of
the first years Ioi' public college
students is doubly discriminatory: it
not only discriminates against the
public college students bill also »-
and much more importantly ~74
against the most economically disad-
vantaged among them. If approved.
the net effect will be an increased ex-
pencc of $|00 for all with net taxable
incomes below $l0.()(ll).
