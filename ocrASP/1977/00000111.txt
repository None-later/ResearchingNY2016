' 'Retired army general William
Westmoreland. the US. army com-
mander during the Vietnam War.
says the government's failure to im-
pose strict press censorship during
the war was the single greatest cause
of America‘s-failure in Vietnam.
Westmoreland. speaking at a
press conference in Hawdii last
week. said it was a “fatal” mistukcto
send Americans to light in Vietnam
with a divided country at home. He
stated that the way for the US. to
haVe won the conflict would have
been to formally declare war. and
then to impose strict news cen-
sorship on how the domestic press
covered the war. Westmorcland
lamented: “Television and the media

WEEDY. TUG OF WAR

The marijuana war between the
United States and Mexico escalated
to a new level last week near El Paso.
Texas. A jeep loaded with 550 ~
pounds of'Mexican weed got stuck‘
in the mud in a shallow part of the
Rio Grande River last week. directly
on top of the Mexican—US. border.
As a result. both countries im-
mediately claimed jurisdiction over
the weed. and both sides rushed tow
trucks to ‘lllL‘ scene. With (1.5.

bank and scores of Mexicans cheer-
ing and cat-calling Irom the other.

ZOOM TRANSIT

Are you xready to travel from Los
Angeles to New York City by sub-
\vay . . . all in just Zl/minutes‘.’
Researchers at the Rand Corpora-
tion envision commuters traveling
from coast-to-eoast at speeds of
nearly l4.llil(l miles an hour in what

are termed “very high speed transit"
trains. According to a proposal
limited-by Rand‘s Doctor Robert v
Salter. passenger trains carrying 100
persons would be propelled through
airless tunnels by electromagnetic
\vincs. Doctor Salter estimates that
such a system. costing about $90
billion to build. would pay for itself
within 30 years. The cost for acoust-
to-coitst ticket: a mere 550.

LEGAL ULTRA DRUG

Oklahoma could become the first
state in the nation to legally execute
condemned prisoners with injected
drugs. The state senate‘s criminal
jurisprudence committee has
recommended passage of a bill
stipulating that future executions be
conducted by the injection of “ultra
short-acting barbiturates with a
chemical paralytic." 'l‘he cointnittce
drafted the bill after Oklahoma‘s
corrections director opposed spen-
ding $(i2.lt(lt) to repair tha state‘s
electric chair and a proposal to
spend as much its Sllltitlllttto build a
gas chamber.
