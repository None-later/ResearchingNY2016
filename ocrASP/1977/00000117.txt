There is a'future for AMIA floor

‘ hockey. That decision was handed

down by AMIA Council on the night
A r ‘ ‘ of February l0th ina
5' three-and-one-half

“mm,” men's intramural
decision-(makers. ”

Players, ofﬁcials. and interested
parties should know of the strong
opposition the sport received in
CounCiI chambers that night, and in
other corners of this campus. Con-
cern abounded for the safety of
players as well as ofﬁcials, and it was
that concernwhich nearly caused the
termination of the league.

As has been reported. the im-
mediate commotion centered
around the serious neck injury suf-
fered by a member of the Colonists
team. Bob Pape. (Bob is coming
along well after three weeks of care
at Albany Medical Center.) But this

  

hour meeting of the *

 

it“? _..:_;.‘l

incident served only to bring the in-’
creased physical activity in the
league to light. Simply put, the floor
hockey league was 'getting too
violent. ‘

The day following. the incident
brought with it a meeting. The pur-
pose of said meeting was to discuss
the incident and to elicit recommen-

"dations for possible future action.

Present were Dennis Elkin. AMIA
Coordinator. Michael Curwin.
AMIA Council President." the
Colonist-Nanook game referees. the
captains of those two teams. and
Student Assistant Tom Monahan,
on duty at the time of the injury.

Discussion centered around the
need to have players and officials
abide by the rules as set down by the
AMIA. The group felt that stricter
rule enforcement would prevent in-
dividuals from losing their temper
and such accidents occurring.

.  Archers Cop Second Again

by Rich Sellgson'

For the second consecutive year
the Albany men's archery squad
finished in second place in the New
York State intercollegiate Cham-
pionships. The title didn't change
hands either. as the Deans were
again defeated by Brooklyn College.
this time by a l350—I |32 count.

Sophomore Jordan Dubson led
the Danes in the six-school tourney.
held last Saturday at Baruch
College, by tallying a fourth place
total of 47.3. The remaining Albany

archers were Dwight Dismore and
Jean Duval. who shot a 368 and 29|
respectively. '

in the women's division. Albany
was solely represented by Patricia
Schink. who scored tt 2l3.

Lacking Time

“We could have beaten them
(Brooklyn) if we had more time to
practice.“ said Dane high seorcr
Dubson. lie and histeammates have
it chance to avenge the loss. as they
face the stale champs at Brooklyn on
April 29.

ailerons]

- heard differeni .views as they invited

all who wished to express an opinion
to come to the meeting tha’t‘evening.
After considerabledeliberation. the
motion to eliminate 1976-77 ﬂoor
hockey failed by a one-vote margin.
Also failing by the same count were
motions to reduce ofﬁcials‘ pay and
to eliminate all checking. The latter
motion was modiﬁed at a later
meeting.

The motion that did pass was one
to add an extra Student Assistant as
a minor official (off the ﬂoor). He
would take over thejob of timekeep-
ing and scoring. With two referees
giving complete and undivided
attention to the game. it naturally
implies better supervision and thus
greater safety.

Further discussion was tabled un-
til after a meeting held Tuesday.
February l5th. At this meeting,
presided over by Council President
Curwin and the joint heads of
hockey ofﬁcials, Matt Staccone and
Craig Starkman. opinions were
evoked from captains and ofﬁcials
on the subjects of increased violence,
safety precautions. and proposed
rule changes.

Two nights later, Stacconc and
Starkman brought their proposals
before the Council. And so. on the
eve of the resumption of the sport of
floor hockey. here are the new rules:

(I) (as already stated) A third of-
ficial. off the court. will be assigned
to all hockey games to keep time and
score. I

(2) A boarding penalty will now
have major status and last three
minutes. This means that the
penalized player remains off for the

se y than near". the > partition.
which has a tendency to giveaiittle.
(3) 1' here will be no body check-
ing. Actually. if a player takes more
than chestep to check an opponent,
the resulting 'cruneh‘would make
the referee call a'penaltyanyway.
What this all means is that incidental

  

contact. the kind of contact that -

makes hockey a ‘contact‘ sport.- will

be tolerated. But that is all. The dis-« 

cretion of the referees will thus be
tested to the utmost. ' ' ' ‘

(4) Any player besides the captain
who argues with the referee on any
call is new subject to a two minute
penalty for ‘arguing'. This new rule
resembles a technical foul in basket-
ball.

(5) The only people who will be
allowed inside to view an AMIA
floor hockey contest are: the three
SA's on duty (and only the ones on
duty). the teams involved. the of-

v refs”. Orlginall

 
    
 
 
 
  

chance for a large'nttmber of men to
make a little money. However. the.
question of- thejsafety of the players
supercedes all other directives,‘and
teams will now see the best officials
in the league; some refereeing as"

’ many as four games», day; ._ , , M

Also. some obscure rules are the
source of controversy resulting in the
flaring of tempers. Among these are»
the two-second whistle .for a puck I
out of the sight of the referee; the fact
that no player may straddle or touch
the offsides line with either he feet
or his stick; there is no “changing on
the ﬂy” allowed: and banging the
stick on the floor to show disfavor
with a call is a penalty.
