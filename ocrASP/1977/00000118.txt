Spikers Capture Two Of Three

by Ken Kurt:

The Albany State Volleyball Club
won two of three matches this past
week. Wednesday evening. the
Spikcrs travelled to Nyack'Collcge
for a triangular with Coast Guard
(who never showed) and host Nyack.

Drop Three Straight

Tile Spikcrs dropped the first
game l5~9. In the second game.
Albany led lit-I l. but lost it as
Nyack vollied for 5 points and a lo-
I4 victory. The third game was it IS-
5 defeat for Albany. as they lost the

best three-of-tive match in thrccv

straight games.

Albany Coach Ted Earl remark-
ed. “Our team averaged less than a
year's experience as opposed to

Nytick‘s three years of collegiate ex-
perience. We started tijuggled lineup
dtte to the fact that eight players had
missed the game due to injury or
academic problems.

"John Vergo played an outstan-
ding game at bump for us. but it was
our inexperience that had an impor-
tant influence on the game."

Friday night the Danes travelled
to Queensboro Community College
for a triangular with the host team
and Kings Point. The Spikers took
the first game by a convincing l5-4
score. In the second game. Albany
trailed til-ll. but managed to pull
out a l5-l3 victory. ’ »

“Eric Stern did at good job. as he
played Well in covering digs and

dinks. and Dwight Buck was unstop-
pable." sitid Earl. The Danes ended
their three game losing streak by
defeating Kings Point in the best two
of three mitteh.

Albany then faced QCC and won
the match in straight sets. l5-7 and
I5-9. Queensboro utilized a 4-2
offense which made for a slow game.
“Queensboro had a good leaping
team. but our attack was strong
enough to take the match." remark-
ed Earl.

Former Class of '78- President

Marc Be’n‘ecltefwill bea‘rrested today '

for third degree grand larceny, ac-
cording to University Police.

Bencckc is expected to surrender
himself to Albany Police where he
will be arrested and arraigned. Agre-
quest will bemade that Bonccke be
released on his own recognizance.
according to Department of Public
safety Director James Williams.

“We will make that request," said
Williams. “Whether the judge will
accept it' has yet to be seen.”

According to Albany County Dis-
trict Attorney Sol Greenberg. felony
charges such as this normally result
in bail being set.

“The matter has to abide by the .
event." said Grecnberg. “The only
reason for bail is to make sure a per-
son appears in court. We‘ll have to
see if the issue warrants it. In afelony

University Police have been con-
ducting an investigation into the
matter since last November when

 

Benecke' was‘ suspended from
SUNYA for the alleged '-tbeft of
$3000 from the Class of '78. ‘

Last Friday. the results of the in-
vestigation were presented to a
representative of the District At-
torney's office and a warrant for
Benecke's arrest was signed by Judge
Thomas Keegan of the Albany
Police Court. according to Williams.

Beneclrc was notified of the
warrant earlier this week.

“We contacted him and arranged
that he come up to Albany to sur-
render himself today." said
Williams. He said the warrant for
arrest will be issued by University
Police Detective John Coleman.
who headed the investigation.

Third degree grand-larceny is a
class~E felony in which the amount
of money or property stolen exceeds
$250 and is less than SI500, accor-
ding to University Police. If the
amount exceeds $1500, then the
charge is second degree grand
larceny.

According to Burton. the charge
will be centered on one party from
which Bencclte alledgedly stole
money.

"It's the Telethon party we held.”
said Burton. “In terms of money, it

was second to our Halloween party. _

were deposited by graduate
assistants on duty and initialed by
' Benecke after the Telethon party.
“He could be charged with ad-
ditional offenses later on,“ said
Williams. “That‘s up to the DA."
“It's a felony and it can go before
the grand jury." said Greenberg. “I
have an oasistant who screens cases
to see if they meet the requirements
and have the elements in which we
can prove the case before a grand
jury. We‘ll see how much is brought
forth and what can be used.“

I‘ve been involved from the start."
said Grecnberg.

Be'rtecke is in the process of paying
restitution for the $3000 in monthly

“Restitution is fine and good."
said Greenberg. “But it has no bear-

Ten Broeck Rent Hike Looms

An estimated 60 per cent ‘of the

The residents ol Ten Broock Manor Apartments, some of whom are
SUNYA students, are facing a possible increase In rental rates.

proposed rent hike goes into effect.

-- according to Ten Brocck Property

Manager Thomas Kirtpatrick.

Ten Brocck Manor Apartments is
a low—to-moderate income housing
project. A single bedroom apart-
ment costs $158 per month. a double
is $I86 and a triple is $213. Presently.
about one fourth of the over 700
tenants there are students.

To protect their right to low in-
come housing. the Ten Broeek
'I‘enants Association has been form-
ed. “It‘s been amazing how people
from different backgrounds have
really been able to work together for
the common benefit." said SUNYA
student and tenant Barbara
Blumberg.

Two weeks ago. 70 Ten Iiroeck
residents gathered at the South Mall
Concourse to testify before the State

Division of‘Housing hearing. They
met with Sol Katz. the hearing of-
ﬁcer. and Kirtpatrick. who is also co-

manager 'of Clifford ' management."

the rental ﬁrm that operates Ten
Brocck.

“At the hearing Sol Katz ordered
the financial statements that Clifford
Management submitted [to the
Department of Housing and Com:
munity Renewal] to be turned over
to us. on my request. for us to review
them." said SUNYA graduate
business and Tenant Association
auditor John Feist.

Feist found that Niagara-
Mohawk submitted an estimate to
Clifford Management claiming a 20
to 25 per cent increase for utility
Costs.

“Historically. Niagara-Mohawk
raise their rules only about seven per
cent." said Feisi. who claimed there
was a discrepancy in the figures.

The justification for the proposed
36 per cent rent increase is based on

Distribution Requirements May Return

by Kevin Ralley

Distribution requirements may
return to SUNYA in the I978-79
academic. according to Chairman of
the Committee to Review the Un-
dergraduate Experience Ray Ortali.

“Students are becoming good
technicians." he said. “but the level
of general education is very low. We
even had a report from IBM which
said that they were usually disap-
pointed in the general education of
their applicants."

Growing concern by faculty
members inthe Humanities Division
over the luck of interest in their
departments led to the formation of
the committee two years ago.
Students were becoming pragmatic.
preparing for a specific program or
job. I '

“Universities are becotning prep
schools for graduate studies." said
acting Vice Chancellor for Universi-
ty Affairs Loren Baritz. Faculty
members on the committee said they

believe this is primarily the result of
the dropping of all distribution re-
quirements at SUNYA six years ago.

Presently. they are exploring
various methods of raising the level
of general cdueation at SUNYA.
The committee‘s report will be sub-
mitted to President Emmett Fields
and the University Academic Coun—
cil some time within the next month.
according to Ortali. It will also be
made pubiic at this time for
response.

The committee of nine faculty
members and three students began
its research by investigating other
Eastern schools to see if they were
experiencing the same situation.
They found the situation not
peculiar to SUNYA.

The Committee then wrote letters
to all faculty members and strident
groups. said Ortali. asking for
suggestions. comments and ideas.
The response was minimal—~20 from
faculty members. none from

students.

Ortali thcti wrote a letter to the
ASP asking students to respond in-
dividually to the committee. Only
ten students answered.

To avoid the situation of reporting
on the undergraduate experience
without speakingto undergraduates.
Ortali and the committee will call an
open meeting immediately after their
report.is made public.

The committee members say they
have given students ample oppor-
tunity to respond, and if there is no
interest shown at the meeting the
proposals will be considered without
student feedback.

The committee also elected to in-
vite representative members of the
faculty and administration to meet
to potion: and discuss a number of
possible program. According to 0r-
tali. the main goal of the committee
at this time is to achieve an educative
coherence for students with as few
Iquiretnentii as possible.

One way to move toward this
would be an increase in the amount
of advisement a student receives, not
only initially. but as he proceeds as
well. Many programs are still being
discussed, however, most of them
haying some kind ofrequirement for
all students in various ﬁelds.

Some of the alternatives are:
Humanities students will need nine
credits in Social Science. and nine
credits in Natural Science; Social
Science students will need nine
credits in Natural Science. and nine
credits in Humanities, etc. None of
the proposals have been voted on or
approved.

Two other signiﬁcant proposals
have resulted from this meeting. ac-
cording to Ortali: (I) a program of
better informing students about
different majors and minors, and en-
couragement for students to choose
a major and a minor in widely differ-
ing fields; and (2) the f urination ofso

assurances from Niagara-Mohawk
of a 20 to 25 per cent rate increase.
and wear and tear—depreciation

' cost—that Clifford: Management
claimed. said SUNYA student and
tenant Steve Schwarz.

Kirtpatrick said. “In regards to the
proposed 36 per cent increase. we
don‘t want vacancies, that‘s absolute
foolishness.“ He said expected rent
increases were dueto utilityinflation
and the high cost of maintenance
equipment.

“We know from experience that
our utilities will go up considerably.
()ur utilities were initially speculated
at $60.000-howcver. the first year
of operation utilities were 383.000.
Last year they were $105,000." Kirt-
patrick continued. “You can see
from our costs . . . we have to make
mortgage payments and pay the
rent. A majority of the tenants know
our problem."

Staff paralegal and organizer of
the United Tenants of Albany Tony
Cheh said. “N ot only couldn't we af-
ford this proposed 36 per cent rent
increase. but the increase would
clearly contradict the intent of the
law. The Private Housing Financial
Law of I962, article two. sections II
and Ila. clearly states that this law
intends to help provide affordable,
safe and decent housing for persons
of limited incomes. such as students
and families with limited available
housing."

Cheh also said. “Teri Broeck
