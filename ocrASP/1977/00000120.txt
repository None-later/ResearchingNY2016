’77 Telethon’s
Rainbow Grows

by Sun E. Miller

Telethon "I7 will be held March
25-26 at 8:00 pm. in the Campus
Center Ballroom. It will be broad-
cast for one hour on channels 6.10 '
and Ill. The agenda includes a raffle
for a stereo system. a children's hour.
and continuous entertainment.- Ac-
cording to a spokesperson for the
group. this is the largest student~run
telethon in the country.

This year. like the past four years.
the money will be donated to the
Wildwood School for Developmen-
tally Handicapped Children in
Schenectady. Wildwood is a non-
profit school run by the New York
Association for the Learning’Dis-
abled. It includes a pre-school.
elementary school. recreation
program. and home training
programs that service over 200
children.

Each April. thirty students are
chosen to coordinate the Telethon
activities. They are assigned to work
on various committees and work
throughout the year with their staffs
to conduct fund-raising events.

This year's events included
movies.jewelry sales. pumpkin sales.
Cabaret night and Shakey's night.
The ﬁfteen mile Walkathon held in
November netted over 52.000.

Last year's Telethon raised over
$25,000. Director of the Wildwood
School. Ginny Russuck. said. “It‘s a
beautiful feeling to know that the
students at SUNYA care about the
children." Ms. Russuck's l5-year-
old son David. once a student at
Wildwood. is him enrolled in a
public school.

According to treasurer Ricky
Figalora. to date Telethon has raised
more money that it did at this time
last year.

The theme for Telethon ‘77 is
“Let‘s Build a Rainbow." The mul-
ticolored logo appears on all posters
and the annual Telethon tee-shirts
that are now available tothe Univer-
titycominunity.

How would CDTA service be

CDTA‘s present plan for university
transportation would offer bus ser—

the present one-way loop. Students
who live closer to Western Ave.
could always use a Western Ave. bus

live closer to Washington Ave. could

: Theuniversity community would

beneﬁt. too. by riding in a better-

constructed. safer. more durable
bus. Many CDTA buses are aircon—
ditioned.‘ And you'd know that the
person at the wheel had gone
through the most extensive. com-
plete safe driver training program in
the Capital District.

CDTA‘s ﬂeet of 245 buses would
be an additional factor. making it
possible to respond to almost any
conceivable demand for SUNYA
transportation. When the present l4
SUNYA buses are all in service.
that's that. And if one ofthem breaks
down. things get even tighter. Some
of those green buses are getting pret-
ty old. They need increasing repairs
to keep running. and some will soon
have to replaced. if SUNYA is to
continue its own in-house transpor-
tation system. That money could be
better spent on education.

Some concern has been expressed
about the future of the present
SUNYA bus drivers. Some ofthem.
if they want. could be considered for
higher-paying jobs with CDTA.

Others might prefer to remain with.

the university. and handling their

    

    

 

situations would be a matter for the
university to resolve. But. CDTA
would be prepared to assist in this. if
the university requests it. In our opi-
nion. regular attrition would nor-
mally porvide. in a short length of
time. useful and productive jobs for
these people to perform.

Having CDTA assume respon-
sibility for SUNYA transportation
would help improve relations
between the «university and the
general Albany community. too.
Every year. the university puts on a
gala week-end event at the uptown
campus and invites the public. as a
get-acquainted gesture. With
students riding CDTA buses every
day. the same thing could be ac-
complished. on a personal one-on-
one basis. every day of the week.

A SUNYA-CDTA arrangement
'could not only save the university
money. and divert its total resources
to education. but it could benefit the
economy of the entire region. Every

tion anyway — but this is the only
arrangement that would bring two
dollars into the Albany-area
economy for'every dollar the U niver-
sity spends. '
Discusaions between the universi-

ty and CDTA are continuing.

CDTA has never engraved a service
plan in granite and said.“Hcre it is —
take it or leave it.“ We remain ﬂexi-
ble and anxious to develop a service
that the university community will
truly‘ be satisfied with.

Frankly. we want and need
SUNYA‘s business and we value
SUNYA students as potential
regular riders. We would remain in
continuing contact with the universi-
ty community to assure that we
provided the best possible service.
We believe CDTA can provide the
University Community with better
transportation. more transporta-
tion. to it at a lesser cost. bring ad-
ditional federal dollars in the local
economy and give students and
townspeople and opportunity to
become better acquainted.

VCDTA wants an opportunity to
earn the support and confidence of
the students. just as we have earned
the support and confidence of the
general public. We believe that a
given the opportunity to work
together —— we can develop the best
student transportation system 'in

CDTA first confronted SUNYA
with their solution to our bus
problem in the fall of l976.

CDTA is a municipal and com-
mercial concern funded by net
profits. federal. state and local
revenue sharing. Why would CDTA
want to add an additional customer.
SUNYA which might contribute to
their debt? ,

lf CDTA were to sign a contract
with SUNYA for a stated amount of
$325,000. they would get an ad-
ditional matched set of funds. mak-
ing their total income an attractive
and profitable $650,000 per year.
These funds provided under the
“Federal Transportation and
Highway Act" can not be used for
the sole purpose of providingservicc
to a particular group. such as
SUNYA. in other words. SUNYA
cannot have a speciﬁed number of
buses or service designated to them.
SUNYA would-- be paying this
money to share-"their" services while
helping to fund CDTA debt.

CDTA claims that they will be
able to provide increased bus service
and how ever many buses needed
during peak times. They have also
made the claim that their buses will
