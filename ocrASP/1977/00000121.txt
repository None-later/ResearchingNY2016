Other questions remain un-

not received about the buses. but was
received from the following question
asked, “What will the status of
SUNYA bus drivers be in this con-
tract proposal?“ Under their New

CDTA has modified their

the entire bus situation remains stag-
nant. Their contract proposals re-
main unappealing to SUNYA. The
proposals seem to be tailor made to
beneﬁt themselves. They have to
start answering speciﬁc questions. It
seems inevitable that CDTA is

to obtain those funds by ﬁtting

Tumerman told the Times “The

Tumerman said he was informed at

device called the “Denver Boot."
The boot is it hugh set of
mechanical jaws which can be
clamped completely over an
automobile tire so that the entire
vehicle is immobilized. Only the
police can remove one of these
yellowjaws once it has attached itself
to your car. Police in Washington,
D.C., who have been using the
Denver Boot sincc l97l, report they
managed to recover $80,000 in un~
paid bills in just tWo months. The
Phoenix reports that the Denver
Boot, more recently and fashionably
called “The Paris Boot." is known in
police circles as “The Big Nuke".

SMOOTH FLYING

If you haven't heard much from
your congressional representative in
the weeks immediately after the elec-
tion. it's interesting to note that at
least six plush air force jets con-
taining dozens of representatives
recently departed for some of the
most exotic spots on the globe.

The Chicago Tribune reports that
each of these planes~—headed for
such destinations as Hong Kong,
Australia, Finland and Iran—carries
its owu military escorts who are
loaded down with rolls of cash “To
make the going smooth.”

The cash, as much as $10,000 per
plane, is generously handed out to
our elected representatives under a
congressionally-authorized plan
known commonly as “Black Bag
Money."

The Tribune reports that records
of previous junkets show it is spent
on expensive hotels, lavish banquets
for the representatives and their
wives. various means of entertain-
ment and for other “miscellaneous
expenses." in addition, every
representative is entitled to, and
usually takes advantage of. another
program allows each of them to pick
up $75 a day in spending money
from the nearest“U.S. embassy.

Every air force jet costs U.S. tax-

‘ payers almost $2000 for each hour of
flying time involved. Thus, atypical
,junket to the orient costs around
$40,000 just for the plane expenses

alone.
