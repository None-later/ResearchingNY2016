By STEPHEN ALMASI

Anton Bruckner (1824-96) I. once
dreamed of writing an opera “a’ la
Lahengrr‘n, romantic. full of the mystery
of religion. and completely free from all
that is impure". Though he never began
the project, Bruckner‘s other works fit
this description perfectly. The
symphonies at" this little-understood
Austrian composer are the most impor-
tant and individual orchestral works of
the Romantic era.

A frustrated bachelor all his days,
Bruckner found comfort in his simple
Catholic faith." and in self-expression
through music. In his day. he was a
renowned organist, professor of music
theory, and director ofchoirs. Today he is
remembered chiefly as a composer.

In his choral writing. second only in im-
portancs to the symphonies. Bruckner
betrays his foundation inthc music ofthe
past. His [848 Requiem. recorded only
this past fall on the Nonesuch label.
shows plainly the influence of Moz'art.
The three great Masses of thc l860‘s.
while daringly symphonic. stand firmly in
a liturgical musical tradition datingtothe
I6th century. His mightiest work in this
form. as well as the shortest. is the Te
Down (“To God“) of 1884.

Bruckncr‘s legacy. however. lies in his
clevcn symphonies. The first two were
never assigned numbers. and as a result.
most music texts credit him with nine.
Ten of these works exist today in com-
plete recordings. available in most music
stores. The last. officially numbered the
Ninth. can only be found in its first three
movements. No performing version ofthe
unfinished Finale to this outstanding
symphony has cvcr been recorded.
though tWo-thirds‘ol' the movement was

i   

completed; Otte‘must ask. if Mahler's.

Tenth can be reconstituted from meager
sketches. why not Bruckner's almost-
ﬁnished Ninth?

Music texts of the It)le and 30s give

short shift to his symphonies. They ac-i

“cuse him of leaning on “Wagnerian
props“. of lapsing. into ‘lpcdantic
technicalities“, and of boring concert-
goers with "seltlcortscious mannerisms".
These deptecating remarks 'apply proper-
ly not to Bruckner, however. but to a
small circle of his disciples. These mis-
guided few were the editors of the am-
putated versions of his symphonies.
which were published during. and shortly-
after, his lifetime.

Forty years ago. cleansed of clumsy
pseudo-Wagrierian re-orchestrations.
Bruckner‘s music emerged in its original
splendor. Little similarity to Wagner
remains today; rather there is a kinship to
the symphonies of Schubert and of
Beethoven.

The mood of his music recalls that of
the Scandinavian masters. Berwald, Ur-
ieg. and Sibelius. One also hears
Bruckncrian echoes in the work of an
Austrian compatriot. Gustav Mahler.

Essentially. howcvcr. Bruckner is uni-
que. The virile confidence of his
symphonies never lapses into complacen-
cy. No other music breathes an at-
mosphere as spacious and intense. For
the symphony enthusiast. Bruckner‘s
eleven giants constitute the ultimate
listening experience.

Beethoven‘s symphonic inheritance
passed into the hands of two very
different composers, Bruckncr and
Johannes Brahms. Each boasted a
J mastery of classical form. and a uniquely
'Eber’sdnat approachtosym'pho‘nic writing.

 

 

Brahms tended to look back to the “good
old days“ of Haydn. recalling the
chamber-music style of the earlier com-
poser. ln building upon the grand style of
Beethoven's ninth. Bruckner proved the
more innovative of the two.

Amazingly enough. the massive feel of
Bruckner‘s music is achieved with an
orchestra slightly smaller than that of
Brahms. Only once. in the Eighth
Symphony did Bruckner employ a harp;
only twice did he call for a cymbal clash.
His instrumentation reveals a magic
touch. delighting and rewarding the
listener. '

The typical Bruckner symphony opens
in a broad and agitated style. passing to it
tragic slow section. This contrasts with a
brilliant. rapidly paced Scherzo. which is
dance-like in character. The whole is
crowned by a gigantic Finale. resolving in
large measure the tensions created by the
earlier movements.

This simplicity of exterior combines
with an internal subtlety. creating it for—
mal balance as impressive as the architec—
ture ofa cathedral. Ritthcr titan dcspitir at
its sheer length. the listener should tip-
proaclt it Bruckner symphony with

patience. ‘ To the sympathetic ear.

Bruckner's music reveals an ability to sus-
‘pend time and space. creating an exalted.
sense of meditation. I

This abstract quality of Bruckner's
music seems all the more remarkable in
light of the lavishly self-conscious.
programmatic cm of music duringwhich
it was writtch No "romantic" music was
ever less self-conscious than Bruckner‘s.

The Fourth and Seventh Symphonies
are the most directly accessible of
Bruckncr‘s works. The Third. somewhat
more bombastic than his norm. is famous
for its dedication to Wagner.

The Fifth is it (irnnd ‘l'cton among all
symphonies. concluding with a tremen-
dotrs. Bttchian double fugue. The Eighth.
his greatest finished symphony. should
pup/e the most rcwurdingto the serious
listener.

The Ninth symphony. as much of it as
we have. is ' , far the most emotionally
gripping of all Bruckncr‘s works. It is dil“
licult to Iccl satisfied with this work as it
stands. however. Commentators suggest
its l-inalc would have been Bruckncr‘s
greatest. and therefore. quite possibly. the
greatest ever written. '
