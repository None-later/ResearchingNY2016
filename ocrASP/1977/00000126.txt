 A recent release of selected jazz pieces
'of the earlier works of four of the top
acoustic piano players who developed
during the l960‘s and who have subse-
quently dominated‘the progressive jazz
scene of the l970‘s appears tobe a ﬁne
collection ’of some innovativematerial.
characteristic of the musicians involved.
Th‘ealbum entitled Chick Corea. Herbie
Haricoek, Keith Jarrett. McCoy Diner,
on Atlantic Records contains a fair
representation ofthe musical ideas which
were circulating within the jazz world
during the time period that the album
supposes to depict. Yet. throughout the
album one gets the feeling that the selec-
tions that are offered on this LP do not
show each of the composers at their best.

The first~side opens with a KeithJarrett
tune entitled "Margot". Although
Jarrett‘s quick. precision rifts are revealed
on this cut, it is certainly not one of his
better compositions. The material is well

‘ arranged. but seems to be lacking in
’ dynamics. Nothing is overdone or wasted
_ as the sound emitted from the vinyl Iulls
the listener into a state of passivity.

The Corea contributions on this album

 were previously released on an earlier LP
as were the Jarret selections. The cuts
' presented on this album demonstrate the

  

’reative energy which Corea evolves
through his innovative piano work. The
tin intiue nce which permeates many of

' ot as prominent here. His brilliant
elodic chord progressions, combined
ill a strong back beat adds ﬂavor to a
sometimes drab jazz sound.

«(.j‘ershwin tune entitled “This is New”, is

Corea’s interpretation of a Weill and

  

the only out which contains any brass or
horn work. This seems odd considering

the fact that jazz started as a brass and ,

horn-based genre. _ g

Probably the best track on the album is
performed by McCoy Tyner and written
by the master himself. John Coltrane. His
interpretation of this tune, called “Lazy
Bird”. isa prime example of how Tyner
attacks his piano keys to arrive at the

desired tone and effect. Albeit. it is unfair

to compare this rendition to Coltrane‘s,

but if this cut contained a bit of Coltrane's ' '

extraordinary sax the result would be
phenomenal.
Unfortunately. the Herbie Hancock

selections do not reflect his proficient
composing. since he did not write either
song that is attributed to him. Both are
the work of the superbly talented bass
player Ron Carter. Both were previously
released on a Carter album entitled Up-
town Cunvursalion and it is he who is
definitely the feature performer. Here
Hancock takes a back seat providing
Carter with some excellent background
melodies to run his dynamic bass lines
over. It seems unwise that these selections
were included on a collection ofjazz tunes
that were supposed to be representative of

Sleepwalker

lly ELLEN WEISS

One of the few veteran Rock and Roll
bands left. Ray Davies and the Kinks.
began their career back in I964 playing
.basic electric music withthe standard lead
guitar. bass guitar and drums. while gain-
ing a small but devoted following. The
release of the single A Well Respecled
Man in I966 brought the Kinks into the
international charts for the first time.
Several years later. after the release of
their widely successful single Lola. the
Kinks left their Warner Brothers label
and switched to RCA during which time
the Kinks embraced the “concept album“
and slowly began expanding the idea to
the point where their albums often
straddled the fence between rock and
theatre. Devoted followers loved the con-
cept albums and hailed Ray Davies a
genius but the majority of the critics and
record buying public weren‘t impressed.
and the albums turned up in the L98 bin
soon after release.

One might be wondering what a cap-
sule history of the Kinks has to do with
their latest release Sleepwalker. What it
emphasizest that Ray Davies has done
successfully what many thought to be
impossible. He has “turned the clock
back“ in a way, and re-embraced his rock
and roll roots'without compromising the

Ray Davies bemoaning life on the road in
the opening cut appropriately titled “Life
on the Road“. His imaginative humor
reaches its heights in the title cut
“Sleepwalkcr“ during which he tries to
'convince his listener that he is a vampire
stalking the night.

Perhaps the best cut on the album.
“.liiltebOx Music". is pure energy that
keeps your feet tapping all the way
through. The final cut on the album. “Life
(ioes On“ expresses beautifully the
bizarreness of Ray Davies'sense of humor.
The song laments the sad condition ofthe
authors‘ life which culminates in a line
that illustrates this hizarreness perfectly:
“I turned on the. gas but then I soon
realized I hadn‘t settled my billsothey cut
my supply-ith-life goes on and on and
on.“

As a total musical experience.
Sleepwalker is probably the best album
Ray Davies and the Kinks have done in a
twelve year career. an album which is.
already in the top I00 of the nationally
charts and will probably bring them their '
long deserved place in the rock and roll
hall of fame.
