' it
 this p’astSunday and thought

the campus was being invaded, you
were only .halﬁrieht. It only seemed
that way. as 49 runners covered the
grueling ‘Zb-mile 385 yard course in
the Hudson-Mohavik Roadrunners'
4th Annual Boston Marathon
Qualiﬁer. Temperatures were in the
40's and little wind contributed to
perfect weather conditions and a
record-breaking performance by
Jack Callaci of Oneonta State.
Four Loops

Men under 40 must break three
hours in' order to qualify for the
Boston Marathon. Men over 40 and
all women must runthree hours thir-
ty minutes or better to run there.

The course consists of four ap-
proximately 6.6 mile loops. it starts
at the gym. proceeds clockwise along
perimeter road. inside the bus loop,
until the bike path. From there a

leaves one at perimeter road again.
Then it's inside the bus loop and

‘ back to the gym where a 360 degree-

turn startsanother loop.

Callaei, a 20 year-old junior at,

Oneonla. shattered the course

record he shared with teammateBill

Young by four minutes 24 seconds in
breezing to a 2:28.04 clocking. Dan
'Wilken of the Albany math depart-
ment. a two time winner here, ﬁnish-
edover l8 minutes behind in 2:44.28;
barely edging out Harold Gabriel of
Newton. Massachusetts by two
seconds for second place.

Callaci found himself all alone at
the half-way point as the other two
leaders dropped out. From there it
was clear sailing all the way. ‘

Callaci claimed that he “wasn't
really rested but I didn‘t hold
anything back. Wish there was
someone there to push me. l was run-
ning by myself." His secrettosuecess
is nothing more than hard work. He
runs l30 miles per week and does
double workouts as standard fare.

The Hudson-Mohawk
Roadrunners Club sponsors races
' on a year-round basis; many on the
Albany campus. Tomorrow at lz30
p.m. they are holding their Ist an-
nual Saint Patricks Day Road Race
starting from the gym. There will be
a 6 mile-open road race and l- and 3-
mile estimated time of' arrival races
(ETA). In the latter races. the
runners predict their times before
running. Whoever comes closest to
their prediction wins. Merchandise

prizes will be awarded to all ﬁnishers
as well as trophies to the top
finishers. There is a SLOO entry fee
for HMRRC members and a SLSO
fee for non-members.

Paul Rosenberg. president of this
HNRRC says these are “especially
suited for joggers. We hold these
races regularly.“ Hc invites all un-
iversity men and women to run in
these races. They are held on a very
low-key level.
