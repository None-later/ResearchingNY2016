for State's gymnasts. For the ﬁrst -

“it ought to be exciting since we

In the NHL. the Colonist: con-
tinued to roll with a “win over the
“A” Team'. Bob Gillen had two goals
for thc Colonists. and Marty Bed-
nar, the Colonists‘ sophomore sensa-
tion, recorded his third shutout ‘of
the season. '
‘ The Be'arded Clams suffered
another close shave. but escaped ‘
with a 3-2 victory over the wlnless
Nuteless Nanooks. Captain Tom
Martin's second goal of the game
‘with half aminute remaining was the
margin.

Although only two weeks remain.
it is still too early to call theﬁnsl two
playoff spots in the NHL. The Stage.

barely tied the Blues Image, 2-2.The
Image tied the game with 2:08 to go.
and then Bob Frankc hit a post on a
breakaway with less than a minute
remaining. Frankc opened the scor-
ing at the twelve-second mark of
period one. Goultcndcrs Matt Stac-
cone (Stage) and Ed Scheingold
(Image) both played well.

While the Stage waits to play a
makeup game against Boys of the
Pin. the Blues Image occupies third
place with eight points. one more
than the Stage and Mother Fuckers
II. who movedintothat tie withn |-0
thriller over Roratuscas. Rich Jurick
scored at 4:50 of the ﬁrst stanza. and
MP ll rode the superb goaltending
of Dave chler the rest of the way.

While Roratuscas and the “A”
Team dropped out of the immediate

‘ playoff picture via losses, the AMF
I did so by tying Boys of the Pin. 2-2.
All three teams are mathematically
alive. however.

This Sunday's NHL feature is a
morning tilt (ll:30). as the third
place Blues Image go against the
mighty Colonists.

The lending scorers. with ten goals
apiece. are Rich Heimerle (Rats).
