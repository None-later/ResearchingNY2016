.I «Spikers Gain Seventh Victory

by Ken Kurt: '.

The Albany State Volleyball Club
ended the ﬁrst half of their season
with avictory over Williams College
on Tuesday night at the University
Gym.

The Spikers took the ﬁrst game
easily. l5-7. but the second game was
a see-saw battle. Williams scored the
ﬁrst nine‘ points but the Danes

scored 10 of the nextcleven pointstov

Duties coach Ted Earl noteda tur-
ning point in the game was alimer
court adjustment by Chuck Durgin.
“it was a heads-up play 'since
Williams was taking advantage of a
defensive iiaw.“ " said Earl. Rob
Harrington's hitting was a big factor
also. he said.

The third game was the closest of
the match. With the score tied at l4.
Williams scored the next point but

won the next three points to win the
game [7-15 and take the match in
three straight games.

"The third game was a dogﬁght all
the way. but we came up on top."
said Earl.

Commenting on the overall play
of the team Earl said. “Our bumping
was strong but our defense was a lit-
tle ragged. 0n the whole everybody
played well and we had cohesion on
the court. Some players picked up
some valuable game experience and
others got back tntothc groove com-
ing off injuries."

"The victory boosted the Spikers'
record to 7-3. Tomorrow. the Danes
travel to Williams College to face

State and Williams.

Benecke Fails To  Himself In

by Thomas Msrtello
Former Class of '78 President
Marc Benecke has yet to be arrested.
Benecke failed to show .up at
Albany Police Court Friday where
he was expected tosurrender himself
and be arrested for third degree
grand larceny. University Police
have been unable to contact him.
and state and area police have been
notified as to the warrant for his
arrest. according to Dept. of Public
Safety Director James Williams.
“The warrant is outstanding." said
Williams. "We sent a teletype as of
5:00 pm. yesterday notifying area
and state police that there is a
warrant out for his arrest. if they
find him. he‘ll be picked up."
According to Williams. Benecke
had agreed to surrender himself
through phone conversations held
with University Police last week.
“llut he never showed up." said
Williams. “We haven‘t heard from
him since."

“We tried to contact him by
phone. but we couldn't." said Detec-‘
tive John Coleman. who headed a
University Police investigation
which began after Beneckc was
suspended for the alleged theft of
$3000 from the Class of ‘78. “Right
now things are going slowly. but
something should break this week.“

Williams said that Benecke could
have called up on Friday. but that it
wasn‘t substantiated. “We got a call
about a death in his family Friday —
it wasn‘t to an investigator. We
haven't been able to conﬁrm it.

“We‘re holding the warrant and
expect to be in touch." said
Williams. “We talked to the lawyer
who‘s representing him. The lawyer
said that he could get in touch with
llenecke. We advised him that he
should."

Attorney Alan Adler. who is in-
volved in the case. although not
presently Beneeke's attorney. Would
not comment on whether he's been in
contact With Benecke or if he knows
where Benecke is.

“l truly believe that More will turn
himself in." said Adler. “I can with
all candor say that he is not avoiding
being arrested in any manner.“

Resisting Arrest

Adler is an attorney at the law firm
of Rosenblum and Leventhai. which
handle‘s SA‘s legal affairs. He said
that Benecke is not resistingarrest by
failing to show up.

"There is no evidence that More is
resisting arrest under penal law,“
Adler said. “i don't think he's
preventing anything." According to
Ballantine‘s 'Law Dictionary.
resisting arrest is “opposition by
direct. active. forcible. or quasi-
forcible means by the criminal
offender in refusing orders issued by
lawful authorities."

“The conduct described does not
apply within the definition." said
Adler.

Adler in unsure as to whether he
will be defending Benecke if and
when he is arrested. “At the present-

“The-students have spoken. There

1. will be no ﬁeldhouse.”

'50 said ,SA’vilection Com-

, . nliuioner Kelvin Dowd lastnight as

he-snnourieed the results of ‘the'

ﬁeldhous'e referendum.

Reading from a printout released
by. the Computer Center. Dowd

stated that the final total of valid

ballots was 2659. Of this total. there

were I560 votes in favor of the
referendum. i099 opposed.

For the referendum to pass. two

conditions would have had to been
met. First, 40 per cent of the total
full-time undergraduate population

would have had to vote. and second-
ly. that ofthis 40 percent. 60 per cent
would have had to favor the con:

struction of the ﬁeldhouse.

“It was close,” said SA President
Steve DiMeo. “i think we needed
35i0 students to vote and we got
2659. I found the 34 per centturnout

encouraging."

The vote ends over a year of effort
by the Student Recreation Center
Committee to fund. a ﬁeldhouse.
similar to a structure located at

time i cannot comment on that. it
depends onunknown variables."

Williams 'said that Beneekc's
absence does not change anythingas
far as he's concerned. “l‘m not happy
about the situation." he said. “The
arrest warrant has been issued —the
fact that he hasn‘t showed up doesn't
change the charge or anything."

Williams also said that a request
will still be made that Benecke be
released on his own' recognizance
after he‘s arrested. “We'll still make
that recommendation.“ said
Williams. “1 don‘t see any major
reason why not.“

Class of "78 Treasurer Gary
Bennett said that he would like to see
the legal process completed on
Henecke. "i would still like very
much to see that.“ said Bennett.

Benecke has agreed to pay the

crowding in them. ' "

“I'm not sure about the rest of the
committee.“ said SRCC‘ Chairnisn
Jeff Hollander. ,-“b"ut the student
members will get together and try to
analyze what were the main reasons
that students voted against the
referendum.”

The referendum would have plac-
ed is mandatory tax of Sl3.50 a
semester on all students for 20 years.
starting with the completion of the
structure. it was proposed that any
administrator or faculty member
would paya fee to usetbe ﬁeldhouse.

Voter Turnout '

“The big question was whether we
could get the 40 per cent to turn out,"
explained Dowd. “I think that there
were a signiﬁcant number of off-
campus students who realized that if
they didn't want the fieldhouse the
best thing they could do would be to
not vote at all."

in an effort to increase voter tur-
nout. the committee instituted a
number of changes in SA election
policy. Computer punchcards were
used. that allowed the voter to punch

out his/her soeisl security number.

ul was a bit disappointed." said
Hollander. “i never made any
predictions though. it was much too
close to call.“

According to Dowd. the election
procedure that was used in the
referendum voting is worth con-
sidering as a possible alternative to
normal SA election procedures.
Dowd said that computer
puncheards might be used in a small
SA election next semester.

Four Students Flee Allen St. Fire

by Bryan Holrberg

Four SUNYA students were fore-
ed to ﬂee down a rear wooden stair-
case at 69 North Allen Street Sunday
evening to escape the thick smoke of
a ﬁre in another second-ﬂoor apart“
ment.

An unused ﬁre extinguisher which
residents said they had not known
existed was found in a locked
second-floor hall closet by
ﬁrefighters immediately following
the ﬁre.

The ﬁre began in an unoccupied
second-floor studio apartment.
causing water and smoke damage
and broken windows to a second-
lloor three-man apartment and the
ﬁrst floor Pine Hills Beauty Salon,
residents said. ,

An Albany Fire Department
spokesman said the ﬁre's cause was
unknown. Owner Adam Haas said it
had apparently started in n matters
in the studio.

Anita MseStay said she and

residents Frank Balazs. Alan Silver~
man. and Peter Thompson were
studying in the second-ﬂoor apart-
ment around 8:00 pm. Sunday
when Thompson said “Do you smell
smoke?" The door was opened “and
smoke hillowed in. it was an orderly
panic and we quicklyegot out stuff
and went down a back staircase. if
the ﬁre had been inthe exit we would
have been in trouble." said MacStay.
Filled with Smoke
“The studio was vacant." said
Silverman. “They would have been
in trouble if it was occupied." Silver-
- man said the staircase to the studio
was ﬁlled with smoke and the only
other way out was to jump from the
front of the two-story roof.

Haas said two occupants of the

studio had “skipped town around
the first of the month“. without pay-
ing rent.

He said he had inspected the
vacant studio around “:30 am.
Sunday and “found it clean as s

whistle."

“The door was open to the studio"
later Sunday. said Thompson. who
said the residents would have heard
if anyone had entered the apartment
after Haas had left.

Residents said a ﬁre extinguisher
was found in a locked closet about
8:45 pm. as firefighters led the
students through the building to
