Proposal Reodmrnends -
Financial Aid Caunselors

Amendments to theeducation law
to ease student ﬁnancial pressures
have been proposed in the State
Assembly by the Higher Education
Committee.

Aides for Assemblyman Melvin
Miller (D-Brooltlyn). chairman of

the committee. said they were}

hopeful the articles would become
law with little opposition. _

One amendment would use
college work-study funds to set up
peer counseling in financial aids.
“Most students face a lack of infor-
mation regarding the multitude of
programs available to them. as well
as inadequate counseling regarding
these programs and applications for
them." said Millerinjustiticution for
his proposal.

that .his vision of non-violent

has not altered.

Berrigan‘s protest today are aimed ‘

at. among other thing. nuclear arms
proliferation. He is in the process of
organizing a mass demonstration to
be held‘on the steps of the Pentagon
in Washington. in April oftltis year.
The propagandists for tbedevetop-
ment of nuclear weapons are having
their say. according to Berrigan. “It
is now time for others to be heard.”

According to Berrigan. the
development of nuclear ,war
materials has created a distortion of
mankind‘s “sense of true size.” He
referred to the Greek mythological
character Prometheus. who.‘i'n steal-
ing ﬁre. put himself above natural
forces. in attempting to explain
man‘s current attitude toward
nuclear power. “The story of
Prometheus is being acted out

The times we 'are living in now are
“desperate” in Berrigan's Words.
Because of the threat of nuclear
destruction. we are living in a society
where “everyone is expendable and
no one salvageable."

Berrigan further urged his
listeners' to ask questions of
themselves and others. One of the
toughest questions that be voiced to
the audience was. “How can I be

At the end of the evening.
Berrigan admitted his message was
neither simple nor easy to accept. It
was a message of hope and idealism.
and a call for change in attitude
toward life itself. He was aware that
his high idealism would meet great
opposition. But in his own words.
Berrigan said ‘that he 'would much
rather be “is destroyed idealist than a
self-made inhuman."

Holmes described it. V .

called it “potentially dangerous to
the public health and safety." as well
as “threatening to the moral and
spiritual values of the community.“

the subject of all the controversy
is a new discovery in biology known
its recombinant DNA. The scientific
and moral questions that have arisen
will affect SUNYA in the future as
members ol its biology stnt'l' begin
experimenting in what might even-
tuullylcztd to major gene regulation.

Recombinant DNA is a technique
whereby it particular gene is isolated
so that it special characteristic cntt be
studied. This isolation is ac-
complished by splicing a gene from
an organism‘s strand of DNA and
placing it in the DNA of it host
bacteria.

By the utilirtttion of this techni-
quc. knowledge of ltow genes
organize into chromosomes and how
gene expression itself is regulated, is

optained. Given this knowledge.
scientists hope to learn how defects
in the structure of genes alter their
function: i ‘

SU N Y A biology pilofessor

. Richard Zitomer says that the useof

the technique. “In no way represents
the creation of a new form of life." as
some critics have charged.

1 According to Zitomer. biologists
are careful to separate the type' of
work done on recombinant DNA
from what is known as genetic
engineering because genetic
engineering conveys the idea ol'“put—
ting genes from one ltighcr organism
into another.“

Zitomer terms such action. “a
pretty drastic wary of correcting
defects." and that he is
philosophically opposed to genetic
engineering and would rather sectltc
eventual control of disease occuring
through regulation. not manipula-
lion.

Holmes says that the topic of
genetic engineering raises ii mortil
and ethical issue of possibly creating
it new breed of human bcittg.

“I‘m not anymore qualified to
answer that than you are.“ said
Holmes. "but I would likc‘to point
out that it‘s'very impractical to think
in those terms.“

biologists are engaged irt is related to

Richard Zitomer. are two rescdi'clr \ V

the sense'thst the techniques they are

using could form the basis for any
number of genetic experiments.
Zitomer is presently working with

thegene cytochrome C. which he is .

obtaining from yeast. The impor-
tance of the work lies in the fact.that
cytochrome C has been found in
signiﬁcant quantities in the muscle
cells of humans. He hopes that by
learning how the gene is regulated
scientists can eventually learn what
happens when the gene is defective.
This knowledge. Zitomer feels
would prove valuable in research of
muscle diseases.

Holmes is now working on a pilot
study ol‘ historic genes in yeast.
Histonc genes are involved in the
production of histone proteins.
which are. in turn. instrumental in
the coding of DNA. “It's a trcmcn-
dously exciting time.“ said Holmes.
“If we can learn how genes are
regulated. we have it very good
chance of learning how genes are
misrcgulnted. and misrcgulation oc-
curs in things like cancer and
arthritis.“

What are the dangers involved in
the work"? Perhaps the greatest fear is
the possibility of contamination.
The bacteria being used exists inthe
intestines of human beings and the
fear is of the creation of a virus that
causes a disease for which there is no
immunization

DNA to study muscle genes In the hopes that such research will
eventually lead to cures for muscle diseases.

Zitomer says that this charge is
“made out of ignorance.“ He points
that built ltc and Holmes are work-
iitg with it strain ol‘ the Iii-coli
bacteria called K42. and that it has
shown virtually no possibility ofcx-
isting outside the laboratory.

Harmless

Even if it could. Zitomer says.
“Youcould swallow it billion ol'ihcm
and they Would pass harmlessly out
of your system in a few days.“

Although ltc cannot be ltll) per-
cent certain till“ his work will not
produce a type ol'ditngcrous bacteria

way: “It you were to tell me that this

According to llolmcs. plans are
