Corrlgan: Some instances are the
food poisoning type or the ﬂu type
calls where someone has been
vomiting a lot. And some of the
athletic injuries. ankles and knee in-
juries where the patient is really
walking for all intents and purposes.
People sometimes call for that when
it‘s not really necessary . . . we
blue to keep some things in mind --
it's not tltat we‘re trying to cause the
patients any hardship because
they‘re not all blood and gttts. The
problem is that if we tramport

Central Council Reports

Central Council opened last
Wednesday's meeting with a lengthy
debate concerning the advertisement
placed in the Mar. 8 Albany Student
Press by The Albany Men's Intramural
Association. The Wontcn's Intramural
Recreation Association. and the
Educational Opportunity Program Stu-
dent Association. The ad supports
passage of the Student Recreation Center
referendum.
trff he council feels that it was an inap-
propriate use of student tax monies and'
not a purpose that was stated by the
groups‘ charters. The council entertained
motions either to freeze the budgets for
the groups until it had checked on the
matter or to charge the groups for the ad.

Both motions were defeated and a
resolution noting council‘s displeasure
with the act was passed. Spokespersons
for the groups will be asked to attend this
week‘s council meeting.

A bill was brought to the ﬂoor which
would have invalidated the referendum

but it was not passed by council when it _

was noted that there may be insufﬁcient
voter turnout to pass the referendum and
that it can be invalidated after the election
if council wishes to do so.

The council then passed a bill which
will allot $2,000 to EOPSA for bills in-
curred by prior administrations. The
council also urged that steps be taken to
hold past ofﬁcers of the group responsible
for unpaid bills incurred during their
ministration.

The council then voted to change the
Emergency Loan Program. The bill
would attempt to reduce the rate of loss
for the program by asking for co-signers
and additional information about the
borrower.

The council will give the voters at the

President Fields told the March Un-

increases in areas we want to strengthen.

stipends.“

As a result. the university plans to

figure some $72,000 more than required.

dent are increases in graduate and
teaching assistant stipends; university

fellowship stipends; special competitive
fellowships; teaching assistantships; seed
money for research; and a new

Research.
