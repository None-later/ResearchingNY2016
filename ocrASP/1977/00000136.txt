Popular Science Magazine7

reports that two different versions 0f
the long-awaited “video disc
players" should be on the American V
market before the end of the year.
According to the publication. a ma-
jor problem with the two systems —
one made by R.C.A.. andthe second
by Philips and M.C.A. ~—~isthat they
will not be compatible. In other
words. a video disc made for one
machine cannot be played on the
other.

Either of the video machines will
enable consumers to purchase
phonograph-record-like discs that
will produce both stereophonic
music or sounds. and a color T.V.
picture as well. Each machine. in-
cluding the player and viewing
screen, will sell for about $500. while
discs will go for around S|0 to SIS
apiece. The R.C.A. discs will include
30 minutes of program time on each
side. and will play much like a
regular record except they will spin
at a fast 450 R.I’.M.'s instead ofthe
typical 33-iind- |/3 ofcurrcnt record
albums. Both companies plan to
offer discs featuring rock concert
performances. old films. opera.
ballet. sports programs and how-to
lessons.

HALDEMAN TAPES

The latest figure to cash in on
thtcrgatc is cx-Nixon aide H.R.
Haldcman. Thr- Ncw York Post,
reports that Haldcman. who is
currently appealing his felony con-
viction for Watergate-related
crimes. is on the verge of signing for
a series of television commercials en-
dorsing -— of all things -— tape
recorders. The Post reports that
Haldcman has been offered $30.000

for the ad spots. Not many
l

Americans will get to see them..‘

however. The newspaper says that
all of Haldcman‘s' tips recorder
commercials will be aired outside the
US.

' CLOUD RUSTLING

A sign ofthe times we live in is the
fact that Idaho state ofﬁcials are ac-
cusing the state of Washington with
"cloud rustling.” That's right. “cloud
rustling.‘f Idaho‘s attorney general
Wayne Kidwcll says that a 3125.000
emergency cloud-seeding program
over the state of Washington is likely
to rob neighboring Idaho of rainfall
normally headed its way. Kidwell

«S

lnims that there‘s only it limited

amount of moisture in the clouds
which are moving east. and that if
Washington uses artiﬁcial seeding
methods to squeeze them dry.
Idaho‘s current drought will be
worsened. Kidwell threatens that if
Washington continues with its
cloud-seeding plans. he will file suit

Washington with illegally stealing
the rain.

DOGGIE DILEMMA ' .
. A California man has been con-
victed of possessing three suitcases
full of marijuana. even though he
demonstrated that the dog who
trapped him couldn‘t smell the
difference between pot and herbal
tea. Twentyeight-year-old Craig
Rosebush. on trial in Bangor.
Maine. employed 5 Perry Mason-
lilte courtroom trick. but it didn‘t do
him any good. Rosebush had been
arrested after a dope-sniffing dog
named Lancer smelled out
Rosebush‘s bags at the airport. Of-
ﬁcials opened the suitcases and
found marijuana stashed inside.

To show how the bust was made.
police brought Lancer to Rosebush's
trial. and hid two boggles of pot in
the courtroom for Lancer to find.
Rosebush‘s attorney. however.
heard about the demonstration. and
brought along an envelope of or-
dinary herbal tea. which he placed
on the floor. Much to the chagrin of
the police. Lancer sniffed out one of
the real packets of marijuana. then
boldly bounded across the cour-
troom. grabbed a second packet and
proudly torc it open. Out poured
herbal tea. Judge Danicl Clark.
while conceding that Lunccr had ap-
parently made a slight mistake.
found Rosebush guilty.

ATOMIC BOMB

A Princeton University student
who designed a home-made “Atomic
Bomb“ as part of a physics class pro-
ject earlier this year says he hits been
bcscigcd with phone calls and letters
about his design from all over the
world. The student. John Phillips.

.‘ submitted the plan for an atomic

item.— rerottédly about. one!th

Au powerful in the Hiroshima bomb ‘

— to the Princeton Physics Depart-
ment. After " _  ff  ls”

ficials assigned bodyguards to
Phillips to protect him against possi-
ble kidnuping by "terrorists."
Phillips says the strangest letter he‘s
received came from a man who
wanted to build an atomic bomb to
add to his gun collection. ‘

DIRTY GERM PLAY

A Senate committee reports it will
hold full-scale bcurings into the
secret germ warfare tests the Army
conducted in American cities in the
l950's and I960‘s. The Ariny
acknowledged Itttc last year that
germ warfare tests were conducted in
at least eight American cities
between I950 and I966. including
tests of biological agents in the New

atmosphere above San Francisco.
The Army huscontcndcdthut the ex-

JOB REFERENCES

"Kojak" and “Baretta” and other
police shows are reportedly teaching
prisoners how to become much
better criminals. Writing in T.V.
Guide Magazine. convicted itrmcd
robber Grunt Hendrick reports that
prisoners at the Marquette Prison in
Michigan often take notes as they
watch the programs for future

PLUGOLA

The Christian Science Monitor
reports that the F.C.C. will soon
launch a series of opening hearings
around the United States into so-
cullcd “payola” and “plugolu” in the
radio and record industries. Public
hearings on: already in progress in
W- "' Dnn DC. and involve
allegations that disc jockeys at a
local “soul” station used their in-
fluence on the air to force promoters
to pay them cash in return for in- '
suring the success of certain con-
certs.

According to The Monitor.
howavcr. the F.C.C. hearings will
spread far beyond Washington.
William Raye ofthe F.C.C.‘s broad-
cast bureau is quotcd as allegingthat
the practice of payola involves all
kinds of stations coast to coast. Says
Raye: "It‘s black and white. country
and western. rock and
soul . . . and you run into it in it
million forms. from paying for a disc
jockcy's Lits Vegas vacation to pay-
ing rent on his apartment to fur-
nishingfrce women for immoral pur-
poses.“

The Monitor says that although
the F.C.C. won't name other cities in
which hearings will be held. specific
payolu complaints drawing federal
attention have come from the cities
of Los Angeles. Chicago. Detroit.
Dallas and Fort Worth. New York.
San Francisco. Philadelphia.
Miami. and San Juan. Pueno Rico.
