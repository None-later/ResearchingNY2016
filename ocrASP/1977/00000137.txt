Tbe‘school had learned to distinguish those

corporate careers from those who would end
up working in a lower east side poverty center.
Maybe we were paranoid. Who knows? I
used to believe that most of the new left, who
complained ofk'FBI harrassment and phone

own importance. The continuing stream of

proved me wrong. If similar committees were
to investigate law school admissions policies
in the 'early seventies they‘d find that an anti-
activist screening process was in effect.
No congressional committee need in-
vestigate the anti-activist strategies of SUNY
and CUNY ofﬁcials to uncover their reality.

Although SUNY ofﬁcials are far more.

ques to negate activist tendencies.

been the seventy dollar ceiling on student ac-
tivity feecharges. The ceiling has been in effect
since the late sixties. and most student
governments reached the limit by I973 or
.1974. The result is that with the pressure of in-
ﬂation. seventy I977 dollars purchase less
than sixty dollars worth of I973 services. To
put it another way, it would take an activity fee
of more 'than eighty dollars to provide
students with the same range of beneﬁts in
I977 that seventy dollars gave them in I973.

In concrete terms the twothousand dollar
appropriation that used to satisfy the needs of
the ski club. for example. now must rise to
twenty three hundred dollars or more. This is
so if we assume the club's needs will remain
static and the cost of ski club purchases will
keep pace with the rate of inﬂation. Student
governments faced with dozens of clubs and
other activities demanding more funds have
felt themselves hard-pressed to distribute their

diminished resources. One SUNY SA Presi-.

dent collapsed underthe pressure and couldn‘t
finish the semester. Several campuses in recent
years have witnessed nasty confrontations
between beleagured SA ofﬁcials and angry
club leaders. '

dollars as Spring or Fall weekend entertain-
ment. ‘

Suny administrators are not unaware of
these realitiesn Their insistence on a seventy
dollar activity fee ceiling, while the charge for
every other campus service rises, should not be
viewed as accidental. Life would be easier for
them without activists. If they can get rid of

' them without pro-admissions screening, mere-

ly by cutting off their access to resources, all
the better. No student voice. or better, no ade-
quately funded aggressive student voice, is all
right with the bureaucrats that inhabit SUNY
Central and some campus. administrative of-
Iices.

In CUNY. a more subtle tactic has been
employed. Usually. on individual campuses.
no anti-student Board of Higher Education
strategy is readily discernible. CUNY has no
activity fce ceiling. and by referendum
students can set their own fees. CUNY ud-
ministrators. by necessity, and out of desire to
curtail activities. have simply stopped
providing certain basic student services. such
as reserving rooms in student centers. Student
associations have been confronted with the
choice of passively witnessing the collapse of
vital services. or stopping in and providingthe

services themselvesThe latter alternative in-
varisbly costs money. This. leaves student
leaders (with 'the dilemma of proposing a
referendum to raise fees, or reducing other ser-
vices to the extent necessary to take up the
slack the administration has let loose. Neither
prospect is appealing. Although some CUNY
schools have demonstrated a willingness to
raise fees to provide desired new services —
«most notably Queens College's eight dollar fee
increase to support legal services — most are

. unwilling 'to request an activity fee increase in
the face of trustees. Usually. a reduction of
other activities takes place. leaving CUNY
students in the same place as their SUNY
counterparts.

Within both giant systems activism is on the
retreat. Off-campus environmental. social ser-
vice. civil rights. and consumer activities are
diminished today in comparison to what cit-
istcd a few years ago. On-campus or student-
related lobbies. and other activities. illt.‘
weaker today than they were in the recent past.
Ironically. their weakness comes at it llnlt.‘
when the larger social scene makes them mtll't.‘

I think not. but it rcmttins to be sccn
whether today‘s undergraduates can cope with
the barriers to activism placed in their Wily b)

is not an exttggcrution to suggest that the
future welfare of New York State may rest. in

Student Security System:
Not A Bad Idea

by David (iold

Violcnt crimes on campus httveiincrcased
one hundred per cent from l976to I977. Next
year. another increase seems almost certain.
The Albany County Rape Crisis Center
reports sceing about tcn SUNYA victims of
sexual abuse and rape every month. Many
students do not feel safe walking on this cam-
pus at night. and the recent gun hearings in-
dicated a large amount of fear and distrust
towards security among students. A possible
solution to these problems is the creation oftt
Student Security System on the university
campus.

O

A Student Security System would provide
for increased surveillance of living areas and
the podium. The students would be equipped
with two-way radios and would act as the
"eyes and curs“ of security. The physical
presence of such student guards would bc llll
important factor in the deterrence of future
crimes on campus. With students patrolling
the campus. the probability of apprehending
criminals would increase. They would provide
an escort service. and could cltcck for poten-
tial hazards. such us burnt out lights. unlocked
doors. untittcndcd pocketbooks and missing
fire extinguishers.

An important side benefit of at Student
Security System is that it would provide it link
between the student population rind the
security department. The recent hearings on
ttrming ttdditionttl security officers
demonstrated tt lttrgc amount of distrust on
the part of students. A student security system
would provide lIn opportunity for students
and security to work together. The student
population. as a whole. would reach a better
understanding and uppreciution of the work
that campus security officers do. There would
be increased communication betwccnthe two.
reuplng benefits in the whole area of crime
prevention on campus.

A committee was formed to urgunllc a stu-
dent security system. The committee consists
of Bob Baglcy. astudent who worked onastu-

dent security system an Drcw Uni\'t:t‘s|l\.

This immediritc Pillll would be strictly on tin

\ To the Editor: - \

On Feb. 9. I977 Central Council moved, by
a majority vote. to' freeze the stipend of SA
Vice-President. Gary Parker. This was the
culmination of along dispute between Parker
and Central Council. Simplystated. they don't
like each other. On more than one occasion
Central Council has attempted to impeach
Parker. When they failed to remove Parker by
constitutional means. they froze his stipend.

In response to the freeze. Parker petitioned
the SA supreme court to hear case 77-I-S.
Gary Parker vs. Student Association. This
was an attempt by Prtrkcr to have the court
overrule the action of Ccntrtil Council. On
Mar. ll. I977 the supreme court heard the
case and came to II decision.

The unanimous decision of the court was
that Ccntrttl Council was acting in an un-
constitutional mttnncr by l'rcczingthc stipend.
The court l'ccls that the SA constitution
specifically sets tip thrcc scpcrutc. and co-
cquttl. branches of government w the Ex-
ccutivc. the Legislative. and the Judicial. To
insure this balance of power the constitution
providcs ll system of checks and balances. By
l'rcczing I’urkcr‘s stipend the legislature cir-
cumvcntcd the system ofchccks and balances.
The court htlS ordered that Parker‘s stipend be
reinstated its of Feb. 9. I977.

The (.‘cntrtrl Council must now make u deci-
sion. On one hand. they can comply with the
court‘s decision and preserve the constitution
and lllt.‘ Studcnt Association. On the other
httnd. they can disobey t he court. thus destroy-
ing the constitution tind~SA. We cannot
foresee a responsible (‘cntrtil Council choos-
ing the pitth of dcstruction for the Student

To the Editor:

The accounting department's ticttdcmic ud-
viscmcnt took plaice oti Monday. March 7.
Slides were shown, folloch by mass. “per-
sonal” hpr itt courtic selection.

It was at this lecture that I first learned tltut
three credits I already bird and three more I am
presently carrying were not acceptable as

Liberal Arts electives. Itherefore. must carry

l8 credits for each semester of my junior year t
to graduate with a minimum of I26 credits.
My University College advisor neglected to In; .

form me last October that three ofthc credits I
was registering for would not count towards
my major. Due to her ineptitude. my junior
year is going to be extremely difficult to han-
die.

The woman I spoke to on Monday
apologized for the error. but said that unfor-
tunately. they couldn‘texumine every “picky”
thing. adding that some responsibility must
rest on the student. Granted. there is a booklet

stating what can not be taken. but I didn‘t‘

receive it until Monday. .

What are advisors there for. if not to tell you
what you should or should not take? It upsets
me to know my future is regarded as "picky"
and that help from a knowledgeable in-
dividqu is not available to everyone.

sunshine, laughter,

To the Editor:

Last Thursday. everyone was outside on the
podium enjoying the warm weather. It was
great seeing everyone outdoors. sitting in the
sun.pluyingguitttrs.throwingfrisbccs.and ac-
ting its though summer were here. There really
was it different fcclinguround  a general lift
for everyone.

With all the cxcitcmcnt however. some peo-
ple forgot about mun‘s supposed evolution
into a civilized group of beings. At about 5:30
p.rn.. Thursday afternoon. the crowds were
gonc. the sun lrty behind one ofthc towers, and
I walked onto the podium. I was amazed at
Wilill I saw. I stopped and looked around.
Evcrywhcrc I looked there were cans. bottles.
bugs. ptipcrs. ttndjunk. It looked like the in-
side of ti gtirbrigc can. I suppose there is a
maintenance crew that cleans up messes like
this. but that's hcsidc the point. The academic
podium is not exactly trhuvcn. but that‘s hard-
ly ti rcttson to turn it into a garbage dump. I
assume most pcoplc hold onto their Cokc can
for about twcruy minutes. and having nothing
better to do with it. cover their eyes and chuck
it over their shoulder. I did notice however.
that .\Ulllt' pcoplc tricd to gel the cans in thc
gttrhtigc burrcls. I lrcy just lllld poor ttim.

Stemming Student Subsidies

Last week‘s referendum results proved that the students on this cam-
pus don‘t want to pay $13.50 per semester for a fieldhousc.

Despite all the efforts to insure a large voter turnout ~— extending the
voting period. increasing the number of polling places. mailing ballots to
off-campus students — the majority of the over 8627 eligible students
stayed home. -

Part of this can be attributed to student apathyjn general. and part to
problems with the first-time handling of the computer card process.
However. the fact that the best’way of defeating this issue was by not
voting cannot be ignored. And the |099 who felt strongly enough to put
their “no” votes on the record clearly bury the notion of a student-
subsidized fieldhousc.

The other side can be argued easily enough. of course, for I560 is an-

impressive “yes” showing. but it isn't impressive enough to commit peo-
ple who haven't even been born yet into shelling out for a multi-million
dollar construction project.

If there‘s going to be a fieldhouse at SUNYA. then the Student
Recreational Center Committee will have to find the money elsewhere.
Any other proposals the committee has up its sleeve will hopefully not
include a repeat of the referendum process. It would be foolish to waste
hundreds of hours and hundreds ofdollars only to come up with the same
result.
