" new YOIIIﬂA a) When his-Atlanta

Flames were ﬂickering recently. wiri-
ning just five games in 23. Coach
Fred Cr‘eighton‘found himself“very
upset that my father sold the in-
surancebusiness.” .

There wouldn‘t have been frustra-
tion about the team's misfortune and
that the New York Rangers were in:
ching closer to the third and final

playoff spot in the National Hockey '

League‘s Patrick Division.

For now. anyway. there still is no
worry about that. Creighton's third-
place Flames trimmed the Rangers
for the second time in two nights
Sunday and now hold a six-point
lead over the New Yorkers.

“There's_a lot of hockey left."
Creighton admonished. “but this
sure should give us a psychological
lift." .

“When you‘re going like that,"
said Atlanta left wing Eric Vail. "the
only thing that can turn it around is
to win a game or two."

That‘s just what has happened.
The Flames beat the Rangers 6—3
Saturday night and 5-3 Sunday for
their first two-yme winning streak

in a while. . ' ' 1

“If we were going to get things go-
ing. we had to do it this weekend."
Creighton observed.

They got things going Sunday
night on the strength of three goals
by Willi Plett. two more by Keir
Houston. and a strong forechecking
effort. ,

“We realized New York‘s defense
is young and that if we forechecked
well..we might frustrate them a bit.”
said Vail. “Also. the Rangers have
got players who like to carry the
puck over the blue line and make
their plays." '

So the Flames refused to concede
their blue line to the New York
offense—often breaking the forward
momentum that leads to goals. They
cut plays off in the neutral zone and
fought for the puck in the corners to
set up a number of their goals.

“The game was lost in the left ear-
ner." observed Gilles Gratton. the
Rangers goalie. "Three times the
puck came out of that corner and
they scored.“

New York defenseman Dave
Maloney stood in that corner at 7:50

At 6:55 of the third period. Tom ,
Lysiak dug the puck out'ot' that same
corner and passed to Plett. whose 20-'
foot shot gave Atlanta a 4-2 lead.
“Whenyougetintoasituationlike‘ ‘
we were in.” said Plett--“you‘ve just
got to work hard to'get out of it.”
That work ethic reaped proﬁts Sun-
day night. wiping out a short-handed
breakaway goal by the Rangers‘ Pat
Hickey and other scores by Ron
Greschner and Bill Goldsworthy.
“What can I say?” asked New
York Coach John Ferguson. “We
have a chance for the playoffs as long
as the candle is still lit. and it doesn't
go out until it‘s mathematical.”
But now the Flames have lit a can-
dle of their own.

Rugby Club
Tuning Up

by Ken Kurt: .

The Albany State Rugby Club
have been practicing. conditioning
and working on techniques for two
weeks in preparation for their spring
season which begins on Matrch.l9th
against Buffalo State at home.

Last Sunday. the Rugby Club
played an cxhibitirin game agsinst
one of the best teams in the area. the
Albany Knickerbockers.

The controlled scrimmage allow-
Cd‘suhslitulions every ten minutes.
everyone got a chance to play.

“The scrimmage was important in
that everyone could get game ex-
perience and Work thcmsultcs into
their positions". stated Cit-Cilfllillﬂ
Niall MeStay.

However. the scrimmage was
played on a muddy field at Westland
Park. and the “kicking gnmc"didn‘t
get much of a workout due to the
field conditions. Till: scrimmage
ended with Albany trailing X—4.

Presently. there are 50 players on
the team. This includes .10 returnees
and 20 newcomers. This amount will
allow the rugget's to field three full
teams against their opponents this
season.

McSltty and Wenccs Rodriguc/
arc the Cit-captains on the team. and
Chuck Rappatro holds the coaching
position.
