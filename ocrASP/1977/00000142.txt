Arango Stars, Boaters Win

Indoor soccer is alive. And the
Albany State soccer team is doing
very well. The Boaters. after
ﬁnishing~ second in the RPI ln-
vitational last week. bounced right
back to win the six-team St.
Lawrence Invitational this past
weekend. mainly onthe "hot foot” of
Carlos Arango.

Arango. who tallied six goals in
four games, scored the only goal in
Albany's i-O victory over Oneonta in
the ﬁnals and was named the tour-
nament's Most Valuable Player.

The Danes had advanced to the

,ﬁnal round by defeating the St.

Lawrence “3" team l-0. Castleton 5-
l, and the St. Lawrence “A” team, 3-
2. Against the St. Lawrence “A”
squad. Albany trailed 2-l late in the
ﬁnal period before freshman Kevin
Leary scored with ﬁve minutes
remaining to tie the game. Arango
then tallied the game-winner two
minutes later. “We kept our poise at
St. lawrence. " said Albany Coach
William Schicfllln, “and that's

what made the difference."

As for the RPI tourney, “We took
an inexperienced team over there
and ended uplosing to Marist 2-0 in
the ﬁnals.” continued Schieffclin.
“We left some ofour starters behind
but had we brought them along. l‘m
sure we would have won the tourna-
ment,”

Albany ﬁnished fourth of lo
teams in the Hartwick Invitational
early this month. The teams were
mostly Division II schools. The ob.
ject of indoor soccer is basically to
keep the players in shape for the fall
season and have new players get
some much-needed playing time.

“We practice Thursday nights in
the gym from 10pm. to one in the
morning," said Schieffelin. “We've
been averaging 45 guys at these prac-
tices; i'm just trying to give them as
much experience as possible.”

The final opponent of the day for I

Albany was Linden State. The
Danes rounded out a very successful
day with a, I5-7. Ill-2. and 15—4,vic-,

players. as will as a‘femsle. player in 4

ting on individual play. Earl said.»

“The middle attack was awesome as
Chuck Durgan and Andy Kinstler‘
played excellent the entire day.
Dwight Buck was blocked only ﬁve
times the entire day. and Rob
Harrington also had a good day."

Coach Earl was also pleased with
the teams performance. “We played
solid. team defense out on the court.
and the overall play by the team was
almost flawless.“

The four victories boosted the
teams record to Il-3.

Tomorrow. the Danes travel to
New Paltz for a triangular match

against Springﬁeld College and New '

Paltz. The spikers hope to avenge
an earlier loss to Springfield.

The goal, according to Albany In-

was to beat the record. And that‘s cx-
actly what the Albany runners did at
the Union Indoor Invitational Track
Meet, Saturday. as they ran the dis-
tance medley in 10:30.3 to establish
an all-time Union Fieldhousc
record.

“We‘re pretty happy about it."
said Munsey afterwards. “For our

verdict. “It's the first indoor season
he ever run in his life." explained
Munscy of Mathis. “He beat his old

Albany‘s Burns captured the two-

couraged.

   
   

"All of them improved their

than senior standout Peggy Rodin-
