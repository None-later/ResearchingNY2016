pmeo to “tie,  i

by Paul Rooenthol

At least thirty state legislators will
visit SUNYA Monday night for a
Legislator‘s Night sponsored by SA,
to help the law-makers understand
i‘inancial'problems of the State Un-
iversity, according to SA President
Steve DiMco.

“It takes them out of their
backyard and puts them in our home
turf," said DiMeo. “Private colleges
are good at lobbying for themselves;
we should make the effort to doa lit-
tle selling ourselves."

Wine. cheese and light punch will
be served. said DiMco who added
the evening will cost about $350—

840”. _

.DiMeo saiduthe affair “is to give
students on this campus a chance to
meet with legislators and talk about
the budget and higher education in
general." He added no speeches or
question~answcr periods were plann-
ed. but informal discussion of the
issues would he the rule.

Major problems confronting
SUNY students include a 40 million
dollar cutback in the “tuition
Assistance Program (’I'Al’) and
widespread academic reductions. .

'I‘uesday‘s demonstration at the
Capitol was designed to make
students‘ views of the problems

r‘kno' n to state legisl  SASU
Vibed’resident Dianne Pi

organizer ofth rally. said‘legislators
“will realize it‘s a public demand be-

ing placed on them. rather than a .
small group of student government ,
'leaders.“

DiMco said. f‘A demonstration is
not that good this year; last year it
was okay. And letter-writing cam-
paigns are not that successful;
students treat them too tightly.

“I'm teary we could possibly be hit
by further cuts.“ said .DiMeo as
reason tor planning the evening.

Initially. DiMco planned Mon-
day's meeting to accomodate some
ISO SA and student group leaders in

addition to the legislators. When

asked why the program was not to be
open to the general student popula-
tion. he said there was “a problem of
cost." But Di Meo said the gathering
is now open to everyone and
hopefully many students would at-
tend.

“Here. at SUNY Albany we're
concerned about this campus,"
DiMeo said. “Instead of us going
down to the Capitol and lobbyingor

demonstrating. we're inviting you
[the legislators] here to see our un-
iversity and talk to usas future
leaders of this country."

Among those saying they would
attend. DiMco said. were
Assemblymen Stanley Steingut (D-
Kings). Perry DurycaiR-Montauk).
Irwin Landcs (D-Ureat Neck) and
Senators Hugh Farley (R-
Niskityuna) and John Marchi (R-
Statcn Island). Several legislators
are expected to send representatives

in their behalf.

President Emmett Fields? and
Dean of Student Affairs Neil Brown
were also‘invited and have not yet
replied as to if they will be going to
the evening. Several other university
vice-presidents. deans. and members
of the University Council and the
University Senate Executive Com-
mittee were also invited and are ex-
pected to attend.

'I he gathering is slated for it pm.
Monday in the Fine Arts Gallery.

Student Wins Computer Battle

ALBANY. N.Y. (AP) A western
New York student who battled with
a stubborn computer to obtain the
Regents scholarship he won now has
two of them.

Charles Fleischer. l9. of

Williamsville. near Buffalo. fought
for months and months with the
Higher Education Services Corp.,
which is responsible for issuing
scholarships.

But it was only after sending
letters. and making numerous long
distance telephone calls that

amounted to a cost near the value of

the scholarship. that he thought the
problem was over. He received the
scholarship certificate in the mail.
Thinking the situation was
straightened otit. Fleischer con-
tinued his studies at (ienes'eo State.
