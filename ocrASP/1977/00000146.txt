1 This‘letter is to‘bring tothe attention of all
those whofushouldV-V be;,eoncerned with im.
propriéties‘in the field - tram referendum.
three incidentswhich unfortunately call into
question thejesufts.
The first occurred while i was voting. After
markingthe computer ballot I struck up a con-
versation with the person who was responsible
for collecting the cards. I told hint that I really
wasn‘t sure about the issue. There were a few
people standing around who had yet to vote.
This individual started telling us what an asset
the lieldhousc would be to the university. how
desparatcly it was needed._how crowded the
gym was at night. and basically. though not
directly. to vote for the fieldhouse. Now ad-
mittedlyf had initiated thcconvcrsation. but it
surely should have been made clcarto this per-
son that he was prohibited from making any
statements other than what was on the ftict
sheets.

Later that afternoon I was passing through
the CC lobby and came upon a similttrconver-
sation taking place between a different person
at the box and a crowd of'tibom three or four
who were waiting to vote. One had already
placed his vote. while the election official was
saying what a great place for concerts the field
house would be antl how it was sorely needed.
etc. He did not mentionthe $27.00 more a year
that would be incumbent upon future students

of the university for the next 20 years. He did -

not mention the fact that ofthe $04 we already
spend as mandatory taxes. some 30 percent go
to fitnd sports which only 400 university
members take part in. He did not tell tlient that
although the field house is needed by the tin-
iversity, the real issue that we would like to
vote on its a student body would be the
reelianneling of our misappropriated sports
lil.\ dollars into the httilding of this :itixtlitiry
gym. He did itot bring tip the moral question
as to the \itiltill)‘ of I0.f)l)llstutlcnts paying for
a building which at most 1000 would use. He
certainly didn‘t mention the stupidity ot
building a $20 million concert hall with the
acoustical engineering of a gym. when the
Palace theater seemineg provides us \\ ith our
concert needs. In all the entire picture was eer-
lilllll} one sided. if not ridiculous

' i‘ to‘c‘arry ut the voting. The sample of voters at

 

  
  
   
  

has in the syn; lobby. There'
doesn't seem to be a more inappropriate place

 
 

 

the gym will'not by any stretch of the imaginae

'tion reflect the true feeling of students on the

campus about the ﬁeld house. _
It appears to me that the seriousness of the
20 million dollars involved in this question

i was not felt by those, administering, the

balloting and undoubtedly enough care and
forethought was not taken to insure the impar-
tial collection of votes. I do believe these
isolated incidents are not unique and'are
probably representative of the.whole process.
Therefore, there is sufficient cause to have the
referendum invalidated. ‘

the great debate
over dna

To the Editor:

This past summer Cambridge. Mass. was
the scene of one ofthe most important debates
in the continuing interactions between science
and society. The question for debate was
whether or not a laboratory forthe purpose of
recombinant DNA research should be built in
that city.

This research involves experimentally join-
ing together DNA (the basic genetic material
of all living things) from two dissimilar
organisms and permitting it to replicate in one
of the organisms. At the present time. scien-
tists are uncertain of the possible gains or
damages of'this new technology. An added
problem is that as of now no scientist can be
cert tin of what will be produced by these
recombinant experiments.

One group of prominent scientists. among
them Nobel Prize winner (icorge Wald and
molecular biologist Liebe Cavalicri. has
agreed that the research. as it is proposed.
presents a great social and ecological hazard.
They have called for open public inquiry. with
public participation in the development of a
national 'poliey; also. a concurrent
moratorium on recombinant DNA research
between evolutionarily distant strains of
organi in hit this moratorium to rtin until
concliisttc decisions are publicly arrived at.

» man. This is‘ because “a single unrecognized

accident could contaminate the entire earth
with an ineradicable and dangerous agent that
might not reveal its presence until its deadly
work was done.”

Even though there is a great amount of dis-
agreement among scientists as to the dangers
of this research. most are in agreement that
there should be public discussion of these
issues. Hearings-have already been held in
Washington. DC. Cambridge. ‘Mass.. Ann
Arbor. Mich.. and in New York City before
the New York State Attorney General.

The SUNYA Biology Department is plan-
ning to build a recombinant DNA research
facility on this campus. As members of the
community facing potential harm‘it is im-
perative that the students. faculty. and staff of
the university and residents ofthe Albany area
have an input into decisions concerning
whether or not such work should go on in our
midst.

Literature on this controversy. including
transcripts of the Cambridge debate. is on ﬁle
at the Biology Department office (phone 457-
8233). I urge all concerned people to educate
themselves on this issue and to make their
views known.

facilitating '
facilities

To the Editor:

As a member ofthe academiccommunity of
SUNYA for some two years. I should like to
take hold of the gracious hand of the free stu-
dent press to point out some vital areas ofin-
terest. These might be of some consequence to
all of us. both in attendance and association
with SUNYA at large.

I am concerned with the credibility of the
student in an environment where he or she is
captible of unfolding the self and building a
better community relationship. With one
atom year to go before g‘riidutation from
SUNYA. lam not disposed to take lightly un-
iversity affairs. or shun these things in an
apathetic fashion.

Let its examine. for it moment. two por-
tapak video cameras presently collecting dtist
here at SUNYA. l‘hcsc cameras were up-
propriated by the Department of Psychology
and were declared unethical by the (iuidancc
and Ethics Committee.

You‘may ask why. Most of us know by new
that these instruments were installed in
various lavatories campuswidc by the Depart-
ment of Psychology. .They were placed in
hidden compartments to film sequences or
men and women engaged in the art of personal
body maintenance.

With so'much concern about the way in
which college students produce their art on
Videotape. why not allow the students
themselves. the privilege of using these in-
struments responsibly.

Let us also examine the situation prtispcc.
tively. Perhaps in a year or two. cable televi-
sion will be introduced on campus. I his min

of' our milieu. By then SUNYA will have n
greater proliferation of students in attendance
from various parts of New York State. tiiil lttsl
from the metropolitan area. Basically. this \till

The potential for these facilities Ill iilt' tin-
