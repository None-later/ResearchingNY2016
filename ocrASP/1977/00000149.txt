  Game No. 3

A few years back. Peter Boyle. starring
in the movie nJoe" brought to 'the
forefront of the American consciousness
a humorous colloquialism. Joeexpounds'
one of his prejudiced “truths” upon a
new-found friend who responds. “Oh
really?“ Joe's reaction: “Does a bear shit
in the lwoods‘! Is the Pope Catholic?"
lhese expressions have gotten a lot of

have been thought up by some creatively
warped minds. _ g

RCA records,'offers us no relief from.the

‘ steady stream of rock ‘n roll albums that

sound like‘every other rock 'n roll album.
Not that that is bad, mind you. because
there are some very good ones on the
market. But it takes a lot more than
Marge. Raymond‘s vocals to distinguish

 

V this band from the next.

! Raymond is certainly the most
E professional member of the group, having

'been in show business since she was I5 '

years 'old. Her earliest inﬂuences were
Motown.’Temptations, Miracles. Marvin

. Gaye. etc. Her last job. before forming

Flame. was backup vocalist for the Elec-

tric Light Orchestra's Face The Music

album. It was at these sessions that she

met producer Jimmy lovine. lovine

decided to form a group around
aymond‘s vocals.

And this is exactly what you hear on
Queen of the Neighborhood: two
' itarists playing very ordinary rock ‘H

II progressions and a three-piece

ythm section keeping a fast but hardly

oving beat. Keyboard player Bob
one is not heard on side one. When Wt
nally are exposed to his playing. it is
ow. choppy blocks ofchords and some
pic arpcggios. although on two songs,
itting in Darkness“ and “Grown Up
 we see that Leone may have more

iy than he lets on. ~

The remaining members of the rhythm

ction. bassist John Paul Fetta and

ummcr Eddie liarbuto. do not seem to
prcciute the importance ofthesc two in-
uments in a good blues band and are
ntcnt with the simpler elements of
1' ythm. Fetta shows some sensitivity on

album‘s first song “Beg Me,"but this is all ,

for the album. .

The guitar work offers some musical
escape Jimmy Crespo plays the leads and
the inﬂuences of the Beatles. Elvis
Presley. Jerry Lee Lewis. Carl Perkins.
Chuck Berry and 8.3. King are. for-
tunately. quite evident. His riffs. by no
means dull and ordinary. show much
thought and creativity. Frank Ruby‘s
‘rhythm guitar gives much to the band‘s
sound of being fast and loud. My greatest
disappointment was the lack ofinterplay
between the two guitarists. 0n only one
song. “Grown Up Man.“ do the two men
approach each other and try to get off on
each other‘s playing. 0n the remaining
eight songs they might as well not be in
the same recording studio. Ruby is given
a lead to play on “EverybodyLovcs a
Winner." It is a good attempt. but unfor-
tunately it doesn‘t go anywhere.

Above all of this we hear Raymond
singing a collection ofsongs written by all
the band members. These songs. about
the streets of New York City. where the

band‘s members grew up. are hard and _ , I .
' style of playing guides the band. A

tough songs With a blues-like, earthy
quality to them. They get right down to
the truth of things. and are perfect for
Raymond‘s sensational Vt ice.

most, significant reason behind this.

change in focus is. of course. the replace-

ment of Martin Turner by Laurie
Wiseﬁeld. Martin Turner played a rock-
blues guitar similar to Mick Taylor
whereas Wiseﬁeld plays in the style of
Robin Trower. Consequently. the music
has changed from up tempo rockers into
tense. restrained instrumentals.

Note about this auction:

Iran. the lnrgcsl producer of Inindwuven carpets. and rugs. has been a
backward. slow-moving counlry for centuries. Suddenly. with the
advent of industry. oil. and free education. it loomed to the 20th
century. As a result the children who were lhc majority ol‘the weavers.
were lined away from the ancient art of weaving. In our opinion. this
great art will soon be lost and so scarce that today European collector‘s
and dealers are rushing to America to collect these beautiful carpets.

to sound bad? The answer is theGap ‘
Band, a new group with gospel origins. '
Trying to combine gospel with other
types of music to come up_rivith a new
sound. they fail miserably. .
Chris Clayton. sax a'nd clarinet. has .
played with the Tulsa Philharmonic. Jimi 7
Macon. guitarist. has played with James
Brown. The Funkadelics.. and Bootsy
Collins. Tommy Lokey on trumpet. gets
his roots from jazz and blues. The
background and talent is there to come up
with a new sound. but something is miss-
ing.
.ust about all songs use basic beats
which have been played at some time or'
another. The key to sounding different is
to lose these beats in the rhythm ol'other
instruments. For example. many groups
come up with different bass tracks or use
electronics to sound different. The Gap
Band fails to do this and sounds like it
came offu machine programmed to play
soul and gospel. Despite the musical
talent. their playing a vocals won‘t win
them any votes in a poll of best musicians.
The Gap Band. in my opinion. has
failed to come up with anything worth
listening to. They don‘t even have a good
disco cut. of which most black groups
have at least one on their albums. The V
:iGap Band-needs a newi‘pr‘édj'ucerwandﬁ 
arranger to get their sound across. lfnot,
