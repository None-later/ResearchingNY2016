'I be long floor hockey season

playoff spots still at large and final
placing yet to be accomplished.

The Downtown Blades clinched

tied matters for the Blades at 3-3 late
in the second period. and roommates
Mike rerrentino and Rick Simon
each netted their second goals ofthe
game late in the third for the victory.

’I he Rats and Spinners. who were

they lost to Maim, 3-2. to end their

Albany‘s Uary 'l'revett and Bob
Audi have been named to participate
in the third annual CUNY-SUNY
All-Star Legislative. Basketball.

Classic. it was learned Wednesday. ,

Head Coach Dick Sauers was named
as co-coach of the SU N Y stars along
with Jerry Welsh of Potsdam State.
'l'revett. a 6'2" guard. finished his
tour-year Albany State career with
university records for most assists in
a game (ii). a season (152). and a
career (406). while tallying 109 this
year for the Great Danes.
Bovaudi.,a 6‘2“ forward. is well
known for his toughness under the

'basket and all-around hustle. Audi

closed out his career with a 9.3 scor-
ing average and a 47.5 career
shooting percentage.

Sauers. who led Albany to its first
SUNYAC title in its history in the
past year has coached Dane basket-
ball for 22 years without ever having

squads to 9-I seasons in the SUNY
Conference although Albany was
named the winner by Virtue of its vic-
tory over the Bears during the
season.

(minimal) up to the P4 level (high).

Compromise Seen On Pot Reform

by Bryan Holrbcrg

'I'hc decriminzilizntion of mari-
juana is expected this year by
Democratic Assembly and
Republican Senate proponents on
the issue.

But according to Republican
sources. uny compromise will be
struck in favor ill a hill introduced
litsl‘wcck by Senator ll. Douglas
llnrclny (R-Oswcgo). Agreement is
possible by May. sources said.

(‘orrcct Assessment

“The assessment is probably cor-
rect" that an Assembly bill spon-
sorcd by Richard Gottfried (l)-
Mitnllattuii) could not be passed by
the Senate. said Richard Roth. press

secretary for Senate Majority
Leader Warren Anderson (R-
Binghiimton).

“Gottfried has indicated backing
off on some points." its both he and
Barclay are "anxious l'orligrccment"
on dccrimintilization. according to
Roth.

(iottl'ricd‘s bill would make
possession of up to two ounces of
marijuana a violation. likened by the
Assemblyman to a traffic violation
for which a maximum $|00 line
could be incurred.

Under Barclay‘s proposal. posses-
sion of less than an ounce and a
quarter would be a violation. with
quantities up to eight ounces subject
to penalties of a one year sentence
and/or a $1000 fine. a Class A Mis-
demeanor. Barclay would also add
penalties of up to ii four year
sentence. Class B Misdemeanor. for
possession in any public place.

 

The sale of less than one ounce
and ti quarter would be a Class A
Misdemeanor under the Barclay
proposal with larger sales subject to
more severe felony penalties. (lott-
lried would have sale of tip to two
ounces treated its a misdemeanor
Willi stiles ol greater quantities or to
minors treated as lelonies.

lhc Assembly bill wollld make
decriminulilnlion retroactive per-
mitting entry of a new judgement
and l‘escntcncing under the new
marijuana law. 'I he Senate bill does
not contain such provisions and
Republican sources said it would be
dillicult to compromise on this
point.

l’rcscnt New York State law calls
for maximum penalties of seven
years in prison for possession of
more than one—quarter ounce of
marijuana. Sale or transfer
is punishable by stiffer penalties.

27.000 Arrests

The Community Service Society
of New York. a public affairs
organimtion. reports that in 1975
there were some 27.000 marijuana-
related arrests in New York State,
widi over 94 per cent for simple
possession. In introducing his bill.
Barclay said. “It‘s time young
peoples' lives stopped being ruined
by arbitrary and selective enforce-
ment" of the present laws.

“Anderson tends to support the
Barclay bill." said Roth.“but he has
not taken a stand."

Anderson led the opposition to.
decriminalization last year as Clover-
nor Hugh Carey and the Democratic

I

controlled Assemth supported
rclorm measures. Democratic
sources said Anderson was responsi-
ble for the defeat of the rclorm
measures.

“The present laws against mari-
juana may serve useful purpose in
preventing laws against marijuana
may serve a useful purpose in
preventing young people from ex-
perimenting and as such should not
be changed without serious delibera-
tio'n.“ said Anderson.

The Assembly bill reached the
floor only alter il strictly partisan
vote in the Codes Committee. Eleven
committee Democrats voted in favor
of he Gottfried bill with elgltt
Republicans in opposition.

Barclay‘s Senate bill stands a good
chance of passing the Republican
Senate both because he is a senior
Republican and Anderson has not
come out against the bill. Roth said
Barclay had discussed the bill with
Anderson before it was introduced.
