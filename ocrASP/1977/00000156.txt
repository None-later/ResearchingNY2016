A 34 year old SUNYA graduate
student was arrested on Wednesday.
March 9 on charges of harassment
and criminal possession of 'a

On March 9. John Albert Rose
had a blackjack in his possession and
allegedly threatened to physically

,harm or kill the woman. Possession
of a blackjack is a Class A mis-
demeanor, said Henighan.

Investigator John Hayner said
that to the best of his knowledge. “it
Just came down to a kind of per-
sonality conllict. What brought it to
a head was mail that had been
delivered late. It blossomed from
nothing into something.

Liz Radko. Alumni Quad Coor-
dinator. Julie Simpson. llrubacher
Hall 'Dircctor. and John Welly,
Director of Residences. declined
comment. “because it would n'bt ‘be
tair to anyone involved.“

The following ts excerpted from this past Sunday's '7SIrat‘ghtline" show on WSUA. Host Dan
Games spoke to Telethon CWChdiprOpr'Mflt'h Adler. and Susan Itzkowltz.

 

Gaines: What tnndcyott get involved
in Telethon when you came to
SUN YAJ’

Mitch: The first Telethon I actually
experienced was last year. I really
got some great feelings out of it.
When I was asked ill would like to
participate in it this year. I thought it
would h~ a really good opportunity
to do something for the university
and do something for these kids. I
get quite a bit out of working for
Telethon.

Gaines: What did you do /a.rt year?
Mitch: Last year I was in charge of
publicity and. during the event, Idid
security.

(iaincs: Susan, what it operations."

Susan: Operations people are
basically the producers of the show,
they're in charge of making sure the
ballroom is set. the concessions are
all running smoothly.

Gaines: What convent-Ions are there?
Susan: There are tee-shirt con-
cessions, and we have door prizes.
Then there is food being sold all
through the night. there‘s beer being
sold in the back. . .

Gaines: Are the t'UIlt't‘J‘.\'lt)It.i‘ [/10
some this your or Itt.\'t your.”

Mitch: We‘ve added a couple of
things. We‘re going to be sellinghot
pretzels this year. which they didn‘t
do last year. people seem to likcthem
a lot. We'll be selling beer and soda
and sandwiches.

Gaines: ll’hut’s the pur/mrc ttl'
Telethon.”
Susan: . . .Albany is an enormous

school. and in a way it takes away
part of the enormity. It gives people
something to identify with. and they
get to meet people in a place other
than a big quad party which are very
impersonal. . .'l‘hey're getting
