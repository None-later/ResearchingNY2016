SCHOOL erLeuce

The Senate :oubcom'rnittee on a

juvenile delinquency has issued a
report charging that violence in
schools is so serious that the primary
objective for many students is “no

> longer education.“ but simply sur-
vival. The subcommittee reports that -

"70.000 serious physical assaults on

teachers and literally hundreds of
thousands of assaults on students“
occur each year. The report cites a
study submitted by the National
Education Association to the sub-
committcc showing that between
I970 and I974.ztssatlltslnschtmlsin‘

DEATH RUSH

A drug publication reports that
members of an ultra-decadent group
of thrill-seekers in Paris is claiming
it‘s discovered the ultimate high. Ac-
cording to Rush magazine. the novel
method known as the “death rush" is
achieved by the injection of a deadly

snake venom. Persons who ex-

perience the high reportedly first
build up their resistance to the
venom by receiving small doses until
their tolerance is increased. Finally.
they are able to take a normallyfutal
dose. and experience a death rush
that allegedly makes one full to the
floor in ecstasy. 'l'ltcrc‘s one small
catch. however: One reportedly
never knows ilthc death rush isjust a
rush . . . or the real thing.

STERILE Penn. , 1
The Swedish newspaper Dageru
Nyl'heter is reporting that in the past
year. seven of. India's l7 states have

set up camps for forcible sterilization

of unwilling citizens. The newspaper

quotes sources in the government as

stating that over seven million peo-

ple have been sterilized and that over

800 persons have since died from in-

fection. or its a result of violent

resistance to the Indian

government‘s controversial

program. Forced sterilization has

not been legalized by state

governments. Dugt'nr N‘rlteter says.

Despite this. in some cities. police

striving to meet sterilization quotas
have stopped buses and I'orldcd their
occupants to the camps. while others
are boasting of having sterilized 40
times as many people last year as the
year before. Dugout N_|‘ht'lt'r says
that virtual riots in many states over
sterilization program might con-
tradict claims by Prime Minister ln-
dira (iandlti that her sterilization
program “is a patriotic mass move-
nicnt.“
