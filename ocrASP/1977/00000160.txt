, To Watch .lulius Hegyi at work, one
would likely be at a loss to guess what
species of music he is busy conducting.
Whether the tempo is fast or slow. the

_ mood somber or boisterous, Hegyi’s per-

formance on the podium communicates

I excitement.

Mozart's sprightly. small-scale bon-
bons left one unprepared for the long-
'winded. melancholy musings of
Rachmaninoff. Although the former
pieces suffered from some poor horn
play. each was played with great
assurance by the orchestra. The latter
work exhibited some splendid solo
writing. particularly in' the beautiful,
Nielsen-like woodwind passage in the
ﬁrst movement. Percussive effects. in-
cluding Xylophone. chimes. harp. and
piano. were well handled; the kettledrums
shuddered wonderfully at key moments.
Rachmaninoff. not the orchestra. must

for.

Aeolian to Perform .

By LESLIE SCHNEID

On Wednesday. March 23, at 8:30
p.m.. Music Council will present the
remarkable Aeolian Chamber Players in
concert at the SUNYA Recital Hall. This
ensemble performs a rich but rarely-
heard chamber repertoire for mixed tim-
bres of strings and winds: violin. cello.
ﬂute. clarinet. piano. Included within the
group’s flexible instrumentation is the
ability to successfully produce interesting
unaccustomed sounds from these conven-
tional instruments. Over the years. the
Aeolians have developed an extensive
repertoire of both traditional and con-
temporary works. as their programs in-
clude an imaginative combination of both
elements.

Hailed as the “poetic virtuosos" by An-
drew Porter of The New Yorker. the
Aeolian ensemble has attracted com-
posers as Berio. Crumb. Rochberg. and
Subutnick to write pieces especially for
them. The ensemble has toured extensive-
ly. both here and in Europe.and included

Music Council decided to bring the
Aeolian Chamber Players here for many
reasons. First. it is a chance for Albany
students to get to hear and see acclaimed
musicians perform works that most
students are probably unfamiliar with.
Second. the group is technically
proficient. sensitive. and creative in their
interpretationand performance ofmusic.
Last. they feel certain that this will be a
beautiful. relaxing and great concert.

The program includes: Martina's
“Madrigal Sonata. for Violin. Flute and
Piano“; Debussy‘s “Sonata for Violin and
Piano"; Crumb‘s “Eleven Echoes of
Autumn“ (written for the Aeolian
Players); Brahm‘s “Trio for Clarinet.
Cello and Piano." 5

By BENJAMIN ALTER

Every now and then a play comes
around that has virtually no message for
its audipnee. What the Butler Saw, per-
formed here March I0” and I6-l9, is a
light-handed farce with one intelligible
philosophy: “You can’t be a rationalist in
an irrational world. It isn’t rational." The
storyline contained a long string of mis-
taken identities and an entanglement of
'characters. As weak and sometimes con-
using as the plot was. the play was enter-
taining. Also. the cast did a fine job per-
forming this work of Joe Orton.

Sex was the general gist of the action.
The play opened with an aborted seduc-
tion. and proceeded though adultery. in-
cest, necrophilia (relations with the dead).
and other perversions. Even a statue of
Sir Wihston Churchill was not spared in-
dignity. At times the play becomes
somewhat raunchy. "guaranteed to of—
fend all but the hopelessly insensitive.“

The blocking was exceptional. a credit
to Albert Weincr‘s directing. The fast-
paccd movement and the sharp.well—
timed exits and entrances kept the
audience breathless and alert. The ul-
tramodcrn set added to the surrealistic
mood of irrationality permeating the
script.

A Special Blend

By SANDY ROBINSON

It was 9:00 pm. Friday evening at the
Freeze Dried Coffeehouse when Lewis
London & Co. came on stage. Although a
little late getting started, their final per-
formance was worth the wait. After two
brief minutes of tuning up their in—
stuments. the threesome began their
multitude of country tunes.

The first song. “Ron Roly.“ set the
general pace of the evening to come. The
comical lyrics. accompanied by fancy
fingering on both guitarqu bass. had the
intrigued audience in laughter. Lewis
London. the lead guitarist conveyed a
most appealing personality vfull ol'jokcs
and amusing stories.

Following this. the trio began another
catchy tune. only this time with the addi-
tion of a harmonica.

With a pause afterward and a joke or
two with the audience. Lewis Londonqu
his bass and harmonica accompaniment
performed a very mellow and beautiful

number. London‘s voice has the touch of

The remainder ofthc hour was devoted

listening to m‘orc of their slow. soothing

This group‘s versatility was clearly evi—'

they effectively played both soft and sw-

and jokes in between were a delight. and
kept the atmosphere lively.

music. the admission was free with a tax
