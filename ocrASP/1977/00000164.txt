“All in all. it was a very successful
tournament." Although his Albrtny

lirockport Invitational licldthis past
weekend. Dane head crutch Bill
Scliicfi'clin wrts pleased anyway.

Losing to a loaded Brockport
team by a 2-0 score in the finals Stin-
day night prevented Albany front
capturing their second tournamertt
of the indoor season.

The two Brockport players who
scored in the chrrmpionship game.
Hob Garcia and Steve Klansen. have
signed professional soccer contracts.
according to Schieffciin.

"1 don‘t rnind losing tothem. Our
team is mostly freshmen and
sophomores; those guys (on
Broekport) won‘t be around next
year."

Albany advanced to the ﬁnals by
winning three games and tying three
others before failing in the final rou-
ad.

“it was a slow day for us on Satur-
day.“ said Schieffclin. After making
the live hour trip to Brockpori. the
Danes opened with consecutive l-l
ties against both Binghamton and
the University of Buffalo. in their
final game of the day they defeated
Geneseo by a 4~l score.

On Sunday. the Boaters opened
with it 04) tie agath the Brockport
team they were to meet in the finals.
“That was a Very physical grime."
Schieticiin commented on that ﬁrst
meeting. “We were the only team to
tie them: they didn't lose a game."

“We had many. many near misses
in that grime.“ he continued.
“’l‘herc‘s no doubt in my mind that
we would have won if it wasn't for.
the Hroekport goalkeeper.“

Albany‘s gorilic. Dario Araago.
played strperbly as well. “Dario got
my vote for the most valuable goalie
in the tournament.“ said Schicffelin.

After the lirockport tie. the Ditties
were put ina position where they ltad
to defeat their next opponent. the
Hrockport "H" team. by three goals
or more to advance to the senil-
finals. Albanv won 5-l.

Semi-Finals

lntlie semi-finals. Albany shut out
Cortland by a 2-0 score to advartcc to
the ﬁnal round. Against Cortland.
Ricardo Rose scored a goal six
seconds into the game. as Albany led
throughout the game. Carlos
Arango tallicd the other goal in that
contest this tenth ofthetournamcnt)
to give Albany a little insurance.

“Carlos played very. very well."
said Schieft‘elin. “Pepe Aguiliir and
Rose played well on defense and
Kevin Leary and Joel: Chiarcili
played very well as substitutes. Some
of our better players didn‘t go to
Brockport and i think that's it pretty
good indication of our depth."

Thus far this year. the Albany in-

Albany Mayor Erastus Corning

has promised to'inspect student-

rented apartments for City Housing
Code and safety violations from lists
compiled by Off-Campus Housing
Association. V.

The lists were offered tothe‘mayor
following altelephone call by SA
President Steve DiMco last week in
which he expressed concern for sub-
standard housing that students were
renting witbirt the city.

A tire on North Allen Street last
week was at least the forrrth such
strident-related fire this school year.
’l‘wcnty-l'our students were affected.

the fires.

“l risked the mayor what he was
doing about unsafe housing con-
ditions." said l)iMeo.

Corning said he told l)iMeo
“students are living irt sortie unsafe
places. If yoti have the places. tell me

  

 

them and I'll see they‘re inspected."

l)iMeo said he then offered Cor-
iilng copies of the OCA lists com-
piled each lycar which contain under
4000 ‘addresses. Corning accepted
the offer.

The Buildings Department is re-
quired by law to inspect each
building within a few years ol'the last
inspection. . Albany Coalition For
Effective Code Enforcement
members said the department does
not fulfill that requirement and
neglected many violations when
found.

Zoning Law

Albany has a zoning law which
limits students to three per apart-
ment. unless they are related. Many
off-campus students currently reside
in apartments in violation of the or-
dinance. l)iMeo said this was
because landlords were still renting
in violation oftlic ordinance and had

SASU To Sue Higher Education Corporation

by ’l'hoiiias Martcllo

Student Association of the State
UnrversitytSASU)is plarmingtofile
stilt against the Higher Education
Services Corporation in an attempt
to repeal newly instituted guidelines
which determine emancipated stu-
deril status.

Students who criri prove eman-
cipated student stattis usually
receive large 'l'A ’ awards. which are
administered by lllESC.

last .lirrie. the legislature changed
the criteria for caiaricipatcd status

for the status. a strident liadto prove

his parents, was not declared a
dependent by his parents on their iri-
couic tax torms. and had not lived
with his parents for more than two
weeks at n tiriie.

“Now. ilic student has to prove
abrogation or derelictioii of parental
control." said SASU legislative
coordinator Joel Packer. “Students

under 22 can apply for emancipation
only if their parents are dead. meri-
tnlly incompetent or if they are
orphans.“ _

The statute set up a fourth
category in which the l'lESC cart
deterrnirtc whether or not to grant
the status.

“'l'hey‘re doing it on a case by case
basis.“ said Packer. “They're acting
as sort of a family court."

Additional categories set up by
H ESC incltrdc the cstttblishrnent ofa
separate household where the
students have been married for it
year prior to the ycrtr applying and a
year of active military service. said
HESC Vice President of Research
and Policy Analysis Michael Cruski.

"The corporation could have iri-
tcrpreted Carey‘s budget proposal
more liberally.“ said Packer.
“There‘s still tens of thousands of
crises still pending one by one."

“The reason why the change was
because there had been ti substantial
increase in the percentage of TAP
recipients receiving emancipated

C orning said housing safety could

l)iMeo said Corning had told hirii
he would overlook violations of the
housing Ioriiirg restrictions. '

“We gave him addresses. no
names forthat rcnson."said l)iMeo..

Dean for Student Affairs Neil
iirown had also told l)iMeo that
revealing the names of students
along with their addresses could be

"I‘m skepti 'al if he‘ll do
anything." said l)iMeo. "lint it‘s in
his ballpark now. We had to do
something to show ottr concern for
the poor housing conditions in

liotli the NYS Senate and
Assembly next week will consider
similar bills that would irriposc strict
statewide guidelines on all recombi-
riattt DNA research.

‘l'wiii bills and memos ofstipport
have been introduced to the Health
Committees ot botli branches of the
legislature. This is a legislatch tactic
used to avoid opposition and hasten
passage of a bill. by plrrcirigtlic same
language into the hands of both
branches simultaneously.

Under the proposed bills, recour-
Iiinaiit DNA experiments are deliri-
ed as attempts to “artificially corri-

Crtiski said that the percentage
receiving this status grew frorri l] per
cent in I973-74 to 25 per cent in
l975-76.

“The way it was administered.
only three questions were asked.“
said Cruski. “There was no
documentation. Now there is tighter
control."

“it’s unfair to the students
between the ages of l8 and 22 to be
treated this way.“ said l’ackcr.
“Students have to reapply each year.
it's conceivable that those con-
sidered errirtnctputcd this yeiir might
not be next year."

The SASU lawsuit. according to
Packer. will attempt to strike down
tiie'section of the law providing the
guidelines for students in the under
22 age group. The lawsuit is being
headed by attorney Richard Lippis
of lluffalo and is being funded by the
Student Association of SUNY at
