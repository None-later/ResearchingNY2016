SASU-DiMeo Feud Develop by

by Rick Pulley

A rift has developed between Stu-
dent Association of the State Un-
iversity (SASU) and SA President
Steve DiMco which may lead to a
recommendation by DiMeo that the
agency not be funded by SUNYA

next year.

"SASU isiout of touch with the in-
terest of the general student body on
campuses. They don‘t work to the

advantage of students anymore."
said DiMco.

He cited last week‘s sparsely
attended SASU demonstration at
the Capitol over budget cuts as an es-
amplc: “There was no need to have a
demonstration“ he said. “Last year
there was a need. budget cuts were
very severe: This year they weren‘t as
severe.“

goals such as restoration of all
budget cuts and free tuition in the
SUNY system.

Legislative Director ofS/tSU Joel
Packer said “Part of our platform is
that We favor rolling back tuition.
but we‘re not really Working on that
because that‘s not feasible now."

Baron said the whole issue boiled
dowu to DiMco's desires to keepstu-
dent tax money on campus. "He's
opposed to NYI’IRG and SASU
because now the money goes off
campus to central budget." said
Baron.
