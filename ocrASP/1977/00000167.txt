In the wherefore-they-nowdepart- ‘ '

ment. Parade magazine reports that ‘ 

many of the people'who appeared on
the widely-publicized "enemies list”
of former President Richard Nixon,

Parade reports that amongtheZld
ﬁnames on the enemies list are sdrneof '

President Carter‘s topadvisers. in-
cluding Walter Mondale. the Vice
President of the United States;
Patricia Harris. the Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development;
Clark Clifford. Secretary of the
Army; and Paul Warnkc. Carter‘s
choice for director of the Arms Con-.
troi Agency.

At one time. John Dean. former

President N ixon‘s lawyer. sent a con-I

fidential memo to Nixon aides on
“How we can use the available
federal machinery _to screw our
political enemies." Parade says that
Nixon‘s enemies list now reads likea
“Who‘s Who in America“. '

GOOD NEWS
Gillette, the razor blade company.
has some good news for men and
some bad nch for women. First the
good news: Gillette has been selling

    
   

l ,

its newI throw-away razor: called

"“Good News." for a mere 23’ cents.

Now the bad news: Gilette has also,
for some time. been selling what it
bills as 3 “Ladies’ Razor." called the ‘
Daisy. for sixty cents. According to
New York magazine, the Daisy is ex~ ~
actly the same razor that Gillette
sells for a mere 26 cents to men. ex-
cept th‘at’it has a pink handle.\

 

 

DEADLY DNA
_ The Christian5 Science ’Maniror
reports that a growing number of
scientists ,around the'world' are call-

ing for strong' international I

regulations to control experiments
involving recombinant D.N.A.

This new ﬁeld of genetic research
enables scientists to manufacture
new and exotic forms of life that
have never before existed. Major
breakthroughs in riewllife forms are
being predicted. including such
things as nitrogen-breathing plants
that'won‘t need fertilizers because
they will be able to obtain all the
nitrogen they need directly from the
air.

However. many biologists are
warning thatwwithout strict
guidelines and controls—the
research will also result in the crea-
tion of new biological diseases with

   

no" known'antibodlel. n such a at.

ease were to escape from the.

, laboratory. it might literally
decimate all life on this planet:-

Many nations. including the Un-
ited States. are drawing up proposed
restrictions to control future D.N.A.
research. but The Mimi/or warns
that national laws appear to be com-
pletey inadequate.

Hargrove as saying. ‘~_‘I arn not'ad-

:human beings—«hey enjoy petting.

holding hands and kissing. All of
those things that make us feel good

Nursing operators are
reportedly opposed to Hargrove‘s

that older people would not be in
homes for the aged if they, were
capable of sexual activity.

ORIGIN UNKNOWN

Two" leading British astronomers
are suggesting that life on the earth
originated—want in the oceans as is
widely believed—hut in the dust
clouds ofspacc. Sir Frederick Hoyle
and Doctor Chandra Singhe say '
there are striking similarities
betWeen the organic compounds
found in certain meteors that have
struck this planet and the lowest life
forms on the earth. 'l'hey add'that
these similarities extend to organic
molecules that are contained in the
dust clouds of interstellar space.

Their theory. if true. would in-
dicate that life is not at all unique to
the planet earth. Instead, it suggests
that many other planets inthe galax-
y. bombarded by organic molecules.
are also teeming with life.

VOICE VOCODER

Stevie Wonder should be coming
up with some strange new sounds in
his next album. Iii/[hoard magazine
reports that Wonder recently
purchased a device called a vocodcr
speech synthesizer. which is capable
oftransl’orming ordinary speech into
musical sounds. The Motown musi-
cian is.the ﬁrst American and the
only individual artist to purchase the
new 320.000 synthesizer.

, ms,

 

The other four existing vocoders
are currently owned by recording
studios and a radio station in Eu-
rope. According to the manufac-
turer. the device transforms ordinary
talking patterns into “a full chorus. a
soprano solo. n singing diesel engine
or almost anything else." Wonder is
now using the device at Crystal
Studios in Hollywood.

BIO-GAS FARMS

Senator (iuylord Nelson has rein-
troduced a bill that calls for the
federal government to set up a series
of pilot projects using barnyard
manure and crop residues on the
nation‘s farms to produce massive
amounts of energy.

The bill calls for the Department
of Agriculture to set up “biogas”
plants on farms around the country
that would process manure and crop
residuesinto methane gas. The gas
would then replace natural and
propane gas now used extensively in
agriculture. and would be used to
genertpe electricity. heat buildings.
dry crops and do other farm work.
