Freshmen John Veruto and Bruce
Churchwell were recently named
winners in the First ,Annual

~ the 65 members of the Albany State

7 _ football team.

Veruto and Churchwell garnered
54 points out of a possible 60 to tie
for .the championship in the six-

tevent speed and weight lifting con-I '

a’test.

The six events were the 40 yard
dash, thejump rope. the bench press.

and the number of steps run in a
minute. '

“We assigned points based on a v

ten-point scale.“ explained Assistant

if someone lifted 350 pounds in the
bench press we gave him ten points:

if he lifted 340 pounds, we gave him'

nine; and so on.“

Of the contest, co-champ Veruto
said: “I thought it was pretty good.

ing the coaches how much you've
been working. It was good to keep

' up a competitive spirit with the
guys.“
