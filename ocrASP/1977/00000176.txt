by Eddie Emerman

“It wasa worthwhile year and a lot
of fun." said Coach Robert Munsey
describing the first Albany State in-
door traek season.

The season ended last Saturday
with an eleventh place ﬁnish at the
New York State Invitational Track
and Field Championships at St.

' Lawrence University. Although
Munscy was a little disappointed
.with the outcome there. he was quite

pleased with the team‘s ac-'

complishments during the year.
“The highlights from a team
standpoint had to be our ﬁnishing

third out of 22 at the RI’I In-
vitational. sixth out of lit at Cor-
tland and eighth out onI at Union."
said Munscyr I

The team consisted mostly of
freshmen With a few upperclassmen.
Munsey lifels this is a plus for next
year in that most will be returning
with a year‘s experience.

There were quite a few individual
accomplishments this year. Don
Dross. a freshman. set an indoor
record in the longjump at the Union
meet with a dump of 22 feet 4% in-
ches. Dross also placed third at the
Stat: Championships.

. Hoop Playoffs Underway

Several teams are battling for the
few remaining spots in the AMIA
basketball playoffs which begin
shortly in three of the four leagues.
.The playoffs in the fourth league
have already begun.

In League I. the championship
series is set: Token. who ﬁnished in
ﬁrst place with a 7-2 record. will
meet the Bushmen in a two-out-of-
three game series. The Bushmen
earned the right to meet Token by
defeating Joker 44-40 in the final
game of their semi-final series
Wednesday night. ’

The ﬁnal game was needed since
the two teams split the ﬁrst two

' games. The Joker won the first game
4l-40 as Simon Steckel hit for IS
points. Ray Gay scored 20 for the
Bushman in a losing effort. The
Btuhmcn came back strongin the sc-
cond game and easily .won it 36-24.

Munsey had nothing but praise
for Dross. “He's a great individual
with great potential." He indicated
that l)ross placed in all but one meet
this year. In addition to jumping,
Dross runs the '/4 mile leg in the dis-
tance medley.

rill: distance medley team had its
own glory at the Union invitational
as they set a new l'icldhousc record
with a time of 10:30.3. 'l‘he four-man
team consisted of Dross. Matt
Williams. Bill Mathis and Mark
Dalton. All but Dalton are

freshmen.

In addition to that win. the
trackrnen also finished first at the
Capital District Indoor Cham-
pionships. also held at Union.
However, in the State Cham-
pionships. they finished a disappoin-
ting fourth.

Munscy feels the three freshmen
are going to be assets in the future.
He indicated that Williams was the
number two man on the cross-
country team.

One runner the Danes will lose is
Chris Burns. and his absence will
certainly be felt. Burns. a long dis-
tance runner. twice won the two-mile
run and also finished third at the
State Championships. His first win
was at the Capital District meet with
a time of 9:28. Two weeks later he
won again by running his second
fastest time ever; 9:128.

Munsey has high hopes for the
other freshmen on the team. “Tom
Fischer will be good in the hurdles
for us as will Jim Cunningham while
Dan Ducady has good speed in the
sprints."

Munsey is looking forward to next
year and says the team will improve.
“This year we were a small team and
we couldn't really experiment. Next
season. with more members and one
year‘s experience. we'll know what to
shoot for and this will help us."

NewMasterstmumwéed  

by Bryan Holzberg '

A proposal for a Master of Arts in
Liberal Studies at SUNYA has been
approved by the Graduate Academic
Council as the first step in what may
lead to registration of the program
by the State Education Department.

mitted by senior administration of-
ficials last year and sent back by the
GAC as not coming from faculty in-
itiative. according to Dettn of
Graduate Studies Louis Salkever.

At least two of eight GAC faculty
members have voiced opposition to
the proposal passed by the com-
mittec last month and currently un-
der review bythe Educational Policy
Council of University Senate.

Region Objections

Salkever said other regionschools
might be able to block the proposed
MALS degree by claiming to the
Education Department that it would
interfere with their existing
programs.

The graduate degree would be in-
terdisciplinary in focus and non-
professional in intent with a
suggested IS—credit core require-
ment. Illustrative course possibilities
included “The State. Society and In-
dividual in the Post-Industrial Age“
and “The Esthetic Dimension." .

“In graduate education in par-

ticular. we must keep students at—m The

least aware of what is happening in

‘u:

». The proposal is similar to one sub- .

other' disciplines." said a senior ad-
ministrative official. “Liberal arts
are by deﬁnition and always have
been interdisciplinary. Lines outside
the classroom blur'.” '  .

"Interdisciplinary has always been
an unimpeachable term." said GAC
member Robert Sanders of Rhetoric
and Communication.

“There are academic and
pragmatic arguments for the
degree." said Sanders. “HOWever. it
was presented on academic grounds
which are on what any degree should
be considered. I suspect a major
motive for the degree was
pragmatic." 4

Graduate enrollments have
dropped at a number of SUNYA
programs. Former GAC member
Donald Wilken of Math said the
proposed degree could be one way of
making up those enrollments.

“If the Administration wants the
proposal for political reasons ﬁne,
but tell them to a committee looking
at academic reasons." Wilkens
resigned from the GAC and Univer-
sity Senate in part overthe proposed
MALS degrees‘s passage.

“I refuse to say that Ican't think
academically as well as ad—
ministratively," said Salkever.

"There‘s a tremendous group out
there wanting this." he said.

Disabled Budgeted For Special State Funds

by Edward Radar

The proposed executive budget
allocates $20.000 for architectural
modifications to accomodate the
disabled lll SUNYA. The
modifications. “would change this
campus from a good one (for han-
dicapped students) to one of the best
in the cottntry." said Rehabilitation
Service Director Frederic Shenn.
I‘lre allocation. which Shenn
believes is still in the budget, marks
the first time that money has been
designated by the state to any univer-
sity specifically for the purpose of
architectural modifications.

In the past. money for such things
as ramps and modiﬁed bathrooms
has come out of the budgets of Stu~
dent Affairs or the Physical Plant.
“A little bit here and a little bit
there," Shenn pttt it. “It‘s the ﬁrst
titne the State is really showing in-
tcrcst." he said. "If this happens. I

would be convinced the Governor
really cares.“

Shenn would use some of the
money to build electric doors in
heavily used places such as the cam-
pus center. the library, and the Per-
forming Arts Center. He estimates
the cost of each door to be about
$2000.

Modiﬁed Bathroom

He would also like to see fully
modified bathrooms in every
building on campus. The needed
modifications. says Shenn. "would
make this place the way it should
be."

Mary Chapman. president of
Students for the Improvement of
Programs for the Handicapped.
believes the allocation is largely the
result of last October's Handicapped
Awareness Day. “We got lots of
radio and television publicity." she
said. “and it made people more

Department. forecasting increased

tion. - '

. “Education owes somethingto the

community." said Salkever.
Salkever reported he had talked
with local bankers who questioned if

current training was realistic for,

professions. “They saytheycun train

_people in what they need to know."

said Salkever. “They want people

with a broader understanding.“
Revise Masters

Sanders suggested one way to
meet such demands would be to
revise current Master program se-
quences. Existing programs may be
stagnant said Sanders and if so they
should be “modified to a less sec—
tarian. less specialized student
within the degree" but one who can
still contribute to the field.

“I feel that would not emerge out
of existing departments." said
Salkever.

The proposal calls for courses
within the program to be developed
by academic departments that are
willing and able to participate in the
development 01' the program. Each
participating faculty person will be
asked to design a MALS ﬁeld aimed
at a specific adult student popula-
..tionw r. 

“It would be neither a highlystrtic-

tured nor a pure cafeteria ap-
proach." said Salkever. .

Sanders said he is wary ofthe level
of student that would be accepted
into the program. “It would be dif-
ficult to assume a particular
academic competence in a class with
a wide range of undergraduate ma-
jors.“ he said.

“Part of the reason behind the
MALS proposal is that students are
too overloaded in their speciality."
said Salkever. “This is an interesting
challenge where the teacher could

learn as much from his students."

Such departments as Classics and
History were mentioned as likely
choices for the ﬁrst development of
these programs. as they currently
have reduced student demands.
F’I'E‘s generated -by MALS students
would be credited to the instructor‘s
home department under the
proposal.

SUNYA Seminar Hosts Nyquist

by Rich Merrnclstcin

New York State Commissioner of
Education liwald Nyquist will speak
at SUNYA Thursday on deter—
mining the function of a university.

The lecture will be the first of a
series on this topic. sponsored by an
ad-hoc committee headed by
Professor Nathan Wright Jr.

Conversations

The lccttirc came about as a result
of conversations between Wright
and Bishop Wilbur Hogg of the
Episcopal Diocese of Albany.

“Faculty are concerned. Everyone
works in his own little corner," said
Hogg. “There is wide divergence
between faculty members and ad-

awure of the disabled students on
this campus."

Barbara Swartz. a peer * r .nselor
for the Rehabilitation Ser Iices says
the allocation “means the governor
is aware that this campus is not total-
ly accessible." She added. f‘To make
it totally accessible would take
thousands and thousands ofdollars.
It's a start and you have to start
somewhere.“

Debbie Curtis. Treasurer of
Students for Improvement of
Programs for the Handicapped. said
“Albany is the most accessible cam-
pus in the State University. but it's
not the best it could be." She pointed
to the heaviness of the doors as one
annoying problem.

Curtis also emphasized that
accessibility is only one of the
problems disabled students face.
One ofthe major purposes of SIPH.
which includes both disabled and

minislt‘ttlors its to what the function
of the University is."

'l’hc chief goal. according to
Wright. is to establish a "sense of
community“ at SUNYA.

“The faculty members don't feel
they have a relationship with one
another or with the students."
Wright said. “They have begged fora
chance to talk about this problem.“

“I have a list of 50-70 members of
the faculty who have expressed an
interest in becoming involved."
Wright siiid.

Wright said that recent cuts and
tenure denials will be discussed. but
in a new context. "We‘ll be looking
at these problems in historical and

non-disabled students. is “to make
other students more aware of dis-
abled students on campus.“ says
Curtis.

The group is currently working to
get more gym courses that disabled
students can participate in. “The
teachers aren‘t prepared to handle
'disabled students." she said.
“Wheelchair bound students need as
much exercise. if not more. than
non-disabled students.”

100 Disabled

There are about l00 disabled
students currently enrolled at
SUNYA. the major-.1, of whom are
visually impaired. There are ﬁfteen
wheelchair bound students. living in
modified residences on State Quad.
The school has received about $35.-
000 per year in Federal grants since
I974 to provide services for, the dis-
abled. Shertn said that he is hopeful
of receiving $50,000 next year.

philosophical terms." Wright said.

“There are plenty of short-term
problems here." said Physics
Professor James W. Corbett. co-
chairman ofthe group. “But our pur-
pose is to look for long-term
problems"

The cttrrcnt crises are vital to their
discussions. though. for they have
made SUNYA more receptive to
new ideas. according to Corbett.
“The time has come for us to rethink
what we‘re doing. Right now we‘re
sensitized; the time is right.“

Monthly Lectures

There will be a lecture every
month during the next three
semesters. Diszussions will follow
each lecture. and. Wright hopes.dis-
cussion on the topics will take place
during classes.

“We'd like to see the faculty and
the students relate to each other on
topics aside from speciﬁc classroom
material."

Many of the speakers will be
college presidents. Thomas Bonner
of Union. and Leon Botstcin of Bard
will be the next two lecturers. Ny-
quist will speak Thursday at I:00
pm. in the Campus Center
Ballroom.
