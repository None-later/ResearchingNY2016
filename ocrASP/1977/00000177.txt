Student Dwellings Needs Money

by Teresa Sutton

l'wo houses are presently under
consideration by Student Dwellings
Inc.. the cost of which would force
the group to seek tit least $l6.000 in
additional funding from the Federal
Government.

Student Dwellings Inc.. a group
orgtinized in ' [971 to purchase.
rehubilittrtc and rent houses in
Albany to SUNYA students. is
currently negotiating forthc acquisi-
tion of two houses tlurt will serve us
the pilot experiment for the group to
make guidelines for future in-
vcstmcnts.

The group. composed of SUNYA
community members und select in-
dividunls from the local urcu. was
originally granted it 520.000 alloca-
tion by Central Council as n bilslh’ to
cntrblc the group to rtpply for outside
funding. »

“Over the lost three ycrrrs. the
number of students wanting to live
on crrmpus hits bccn lrtrgcr than we
ctru house." said SUNYA
Rcsidcuccs Director John Wclty.

According to Welty. during Fall
'75. approximately 4|5 students“ re-

quests for housing had to be denied.
Lust yertr 300 such applications were
refused.

Thc Student Dwellings project is
just one method to easing SUNYA
over-crowding being examined. To
help meet the housing shor-
tage. floors 2 through 9 of Indian
Quad‘s Mohawk 'l‘owcr will be.
transformed from offices to dor-
mitory accommodations. The I68
spaces crcntcd will bring the total
avrtiltrblc to approximately 5958.
The five quuds house 5590 and the
Hotel Wellington about 200.

The student dwellings presently
being considered will house six to I2
students if purchased. If the experi-
ment proves fruitful. more buildings
will be acquired in the next few
years.

Under Consideration

The locations of the two houses
under consideration could not be
disclosed at present but the cost of
both combined Would lultll 536.000

DiMco. A downpuymcnt of uboul
