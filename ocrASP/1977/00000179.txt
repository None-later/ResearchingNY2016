him by his ear and arrested him

.  ' Horse race'handicapping is going

to college.
In the spring semester at Hofatra
University‘s Division of Continuing

Educationa cou'rse titled “Off and ,

Running: Handicapping the Horses
for Fun and Profit" will be among
the 300 courses offered for adults.
Last week. Assemblyman Albert
B. Lewis (D-22nd District) said “the
fact that a university would even

consider let alone enroll and'teacb.

such acoursc. i find shocking. A
course showing ‘i'low to Get in the
Running‘ will do nothing but
produce innocents. confident that
they can ‘beat the systeni' and make a
fast buck.“

The course will be taught by Joe
Cardello. a history lecturer at
Hofstra. He holds a Hofstra BA.
and M.A. from the State University
at Stony Brook. The adult course
bulletin notestliat Mr. Cardello"has

followed horses closely since i970;
has spent extended periods at the
track.” ‘

The Hofstra adult course‘b‘ulletin _

carries the following description of
Mr. Cardello‘s class:

“Expansion of the horse racingin-
dustry in‘recent years offers the
public-both an exciting form of
entertainment and a chance for
profit. Racing as a diversion certain-
ly provides sufficient reason for
public interest: but the profit can
only go to those willing to take the
time and effort necessary to unders-
tand the complex game of
thoroughbred racing. 'l his course is
designed to provide the essentials of

,such iitid understanding.

"Each session will provide a
sophisticated analysis of the critical
factors in handicapping
thoroughbred races. from an ex-
amination ol basic handicapping

abuses of the Racing Form. th
Course will consider in de'pthsuch '

 

and bettot; principles. and loan-
derstanding of both' the uses and

 

topics as determining track condi4

tion. reliable track variants. race-- W

watching. and board watching. the
meaning ofworkoutsamd the crucial
importance of the trainer. Examples
from recent races will be used ineach
case to illustrate favorable betting
situations.

Special attention will be given to
two-year—old racing (the most
predictablelnf all) and to turf racing
where a limits-ledge of breeding litics
cati bring profitable results.

“l-"or those interested in off-track
betting. a discussion of the problems
of betting olf-track will be included.
as well as a bi‘icl analysis ol harness
racing as a possible alternative. An
optional day at the track “iii be dis-
cussed with the elass." -

WSUA Airs Student Patrol Views

Following are excerpts fromthis
past Sunday‘s Straightline show on
WSUA 640 AM. Host Dan Gaines
spoke to the Director of Public Safe-
ty Jim Williams and David Gold.
Chairperson of Central Council's
Committee on Health. Safety and
the Law on the subject of student
security patrols.

Gaines: What '.i' the history ol'slutlenl
security patrols at S UN'YA?

Williams: We had a student patrol
that lasted about a year and a halfin
I97 l-72 . . . we‘ve done considerable
research at other campuses
throughout the country as to what

format they had. We had a limited
amount of money -— about 520.000.
Gaines: What was the impetus to
.i'lal‘l the patrol?

Williams: To bridge the gap. as it
was called. between our department
and the student body.

Gaines: When the committee was
discussing the reimplememation of
student security patrols, did they
think about trust and improving
relations between security and
students."

amount of distrust among students
for the work of the Department of
Public Safety. After talkingto some

Gaines: What prob/tans did the stu-

Williams: The major disadvantage
comes from ommunication.
specifically the radios. We simply. at

radios to issue to a new student
