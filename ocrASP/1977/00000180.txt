across the nation . . . and for
tinderstandahlc reasons. The issues
surrounding DNA recombinant research
draw into sharp focus a university‘s basic
responsibilities for piercing the veil of
ignorance and at the same time for
assuring the physical safety of the
proximate ptrblie.

So that we may be fully confident ofttie
wisdom of our planned course. I am
asking the Office (if-Research and the
Council on Research to undcrt‘akejointly
a careful examination of the social risks.
if arty. of the recombinant projects
contemplated by faculty members ofthc
Biology Department. I also ask that you
complete a thorough assessment of the
adequacy of safeguards specified for such
circumstances. It is my expectation that
any sttclt research to be condttctcd on this
catrtptts must be ill fitll compliance with
all physical and procedural requirements
of the l-cderal and New York State
governments on this subject. I would like
to receive your findings and arty
rccomincndatioirs for netioit by May I.
I977. if possible.

"In keeping “ith our fundamental
responsibility to enlarge general
understanding. Chairman l.crman and
his colleagues iir lliology lta\c urged the
initiation of a program of. pttblic
discussion and education on the types of

faculty on this 'ampus. lz'endorse this

suggestion and reqttest that you organile

rind conduct on campus this spring one
or more conferences to enhance the
understanding and appreciation of the
potentials and limitations ol'tltis research
technique. It will be most desirable to
invite representatives ol' the larger
community to join faculty and students in
these discussions in order to insure the
fullest consideration of relevant issues.

“Your thoughtful nttctttiort to this task
can b - an important contribution both to
the llniyersity and to the people it series.
Please do not hesitate to call upon me or
any meinhcr ol my staff if we may be of
assistance to you in 'arrying ottt this
assignment."
