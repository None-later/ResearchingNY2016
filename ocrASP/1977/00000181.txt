‘ A Canadian agricultural.“th
clan who worked in Cuba has told

turkeys in Cuba with‘Newcattle‘ Dis"-
ease. The Canadian. however; is‘
quoted as saying he duped the C.l.‘A.
by accepting the money. but then:
secretly destroying the Newcaltle
virus before he reached Cuba. ‘
According to the newspaper‘s ac-
count. the technician‘s rip-off of the
agency was later aided by the fact
that 8000 turkeys in western Cuba
died of unsuspected causes not
related to Newcastle Disease. but the

C.l.A. apparently believed he had '-
‘ been successful. What did thetechni-

ciun do with the money‘ch reported
he had “one hell of a goodtime”with
it in Miami and New Orleans.

Women may soon be allowed to
land planes on carriers. and serve on

the Defense Department goes
through. The department is
reportedly recommending to the
White House that the law banning
women from warships be changed.

ministration and sent promptly to ‘

Congress. “ The Defense.

Department's.‘t)roposal is seen as a
major effort to solve the current

 

shortage of voluntary military per-
sonnel by filling the ranks of the ser-
viccs with wotncn. 'l'he recommen-
dation comes in the wake ol'a_rcccnt
Pentagon stttdy which indicates that
women cope with military duty
better than their male counterparts.
