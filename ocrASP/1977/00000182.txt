storming dismayed-iii the large number of
r people-who are unaware of the Community
Service program iit Sl-JNYA. his a very
successful program. rind the vast majority of
. participants report great s: istaction in being
a ptirt of it.‘Studenls at most schools
habitually complain that .the process of

learning should entail more thtinjusi sitting in '

classrooms. Community Service offers an
alternative. A student taking this course has
the opportunity to work in the tri-city area in
one of approximately 200 agencies. The
possible areas are numerous: one can work

with people from all walks ol'life. Students can

work at the American Cancer Society. Legal

Aid Society. La Salle School. New York State

Museum. .Arbo‘r Hill Day Care Center.

Daughters of Sarah Nursing Home. VA

Hospital. Albany Association of the Blind.

NYl’lR(i. Rape Crisis Center. etc. There are

many. many ruore.

This course carries lluee credits and tnay be
trrkcn twice. A student is required to work sis
liotrrs per Week at the agency. If you are
interested in lielpirig the community and
gaining rr‘ialirable e\perience. I urge you to
attend the (‘ornn’inniiy Service Registration.

on the "
campaign trail

To the Editor:

Student Association has taken the easy way
out. It concentrates on the funding ofgroiips
and its own internal matters. SA has the
potential to aflect rriueli more than the
routine.

We must take advantage of that potential.
We need to shape the university's budget.
program and grade policy. the conditions for
till-campus students. and the role of the
university in the community. I am Dan

“editor. advertising manager and as the Editor-

‘ in-Cbie'f.-3I have learned about. and know.
people in every corner of. the university. I

i know how decisions are made and how things

work.

'wbovcan deal easily. quickly. and efﬁciently
with routine. internal SA matters. lwill. for l
have extensive organizational and leadership
ei'tperience from the ASP. I‘ve also been close
to Student Association forffour years. end
have seen it make both mistakes and progress.
~l've alito been involved elsewhere: The UAS
Board of Directors. SA Supreme Court: and
various projects. I am in charge of the
publication of next fall‘s telephone directory.
it will be earlier. and more accurate than this
year‘s. . , .

We have to take advantage ot‘our resources.
SA must attract and interest students to work
at improving SUNYA. SA must have more
contact with the faculty they have ignored
the fact that differences between
administrators rind ,l‘ticulty can be
advantageous to students.

I already have a head start. I have the '

respect of the administrators and the faculty.
the knowledge. and the concern. I know the
media. how to improve communication. and l
have the experience.

I hope you will listen carefully to all the
candidates in this coming SA election. Jim
Aronoff will be' running with me for Vice
President. 0ch its a chance to convince you
that we will bring to SA the tibilities. the
knowledge. rind the expcrrence that it needs.

. . . and running
alongside

To the Editor:

My name is Jim Aronol'f and l‘rn running
for Vice President of Student Association.

l'his letter is my first step towards informing
the students of my qualifications and
intentions. I hope that the inlormed student‘s
vote will be based on his knowledge of the
candidates and not whose posters are the most
appealing. I

As air elected representative to both
University Senate and Central Council. I have

 

we need, a Student Association president I

gained an intimate knowledgeof the wey'tltese
bodies operate. More importantly. I hlye

learned how they could'operate. As an '

appointed member ofthc Special Committee
to Review the Undergraduate Experiencemnd
the Undergraduate Academics Council. I have
gained valuable experience in dealing with
faculty andadminisirators on a personal level.
A good rapport with these segments of the
university community is essential to take SA
beyond its routine internal matters. These
matters will continue regardless of 'who is,
elected. ‘ - ‘

Most student leaders fail to attain this
mutual respect. it they do. however. it is many
months after being elected. As a result.
valuable time is wasted: ’As an active member
of Central Council. and it member of its
finance committee for two years. I learned the
intricacies of fund allocation and the
budgetary process. In order to be an effective
Student Association Vice President this
knowledge is necessary. birt not sufficient. I
have the ncce sary requirements; thegability to
effectively use all this. knowledge.

I hope that before you vote for next year‘s

 

student government you compare the»

candidate's. My extensive knowledge of SA
and the university. combined with the broad
experience of my rirnnirrg unite Dan (iaincs.
will give students the best Strident Association
Executive Branch possible.

central council
could be better

To the Editor:

SUNY Albany needs an active Student
Association. l have seen the Central Council
rill'eet the actiiilies of many stirderits. livery
Wednesday. at 7:10 p.tll.. in Campus Center
175. Central Council meets to tote on hills
which decide what student groups get money
arid lion rutrclr. the meetings usually last
about three hours. :\l this tiitie. Central
Council rcprescritatries argue. debate. and
otherwise \erhirlly wrestle \vithcach othcrand
representatives ol groups requesting I’iiittls.‘
llte groups corniirg belore t he (’otrrieil include
cultural groups. athletic groups. and academic
groups.

Central Council has at its disposal the
thirty-three dollars that every undergraduate
pays each semester in the torrrr ofa mandatory

 

student tail. Needless to say. it
of money. .

- The reason I rim writing this letter lsto

encourage people to “gut amused-r and,

consider running for (‘cmml 0mm"

In addition to allocating money.
Student Association.- ol \\'|l|clt ("ennui
