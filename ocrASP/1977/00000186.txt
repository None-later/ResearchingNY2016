For the lust time in the history ofSUNY/t.
disahlcd students could engage in competitive
group sports. stilllclilillg they were previously

With the Spring  vacationdschedule.
Because of certain religious convictIOns
and related family Obligations, it will be
extremely difficultpfor me to return in
time for classes on Monday April 11.

It is unfair that I should be forced to

weigh a. day of classes against other re-
sponsibilities, and be forced to neglect
one or the other. I ask that you correct

this inequity. Cancel classes on April ll.

Sincerely,

SUNYA Student

I would like to express  dissatisfacvtioriii‘f .

 

 

It is without malice or forethought that the Albany Student Press presents to its readers
the annual “Kick-Itollw-rtSI’". ‘l‘his obnoxious bclittlctnent of all that is sacred and
serious is Ior your entertainment.
