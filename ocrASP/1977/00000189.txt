with a little more than six minutes
remaining on a pair of free throws by
Butch Lcc. aster, last summer for the

North Carolina appeared to be
back in contention during a state of
confusion with |245 left in the game.

Officials called a flagrant
technical foul on Marquette‘s Ber-
nard 'l‘oonc. who also was fouled on
the play. 'l‘oonc missed his foul shot.
and Olympian Walter Davis con-
verted twice for the far llccls. cut-

The confusion arose when some
