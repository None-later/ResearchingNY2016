lint thegym has been of some beneﬁt as have the practices in

' lie-two months before the season opener.
The to“ ill Kestenbaum (sprained ankle) last month left Earl with

' only ten men oli'rtite'squad but, amazingly. the team has not been adversely ‘
‘ affected,  Ithough the team lacks depth in numbers. there is no lack in

q “Thy: seventh, “shut and nlnth men are all lmportant." says Earl. “When i

go to them they have no time to warm up. And when i do call on them it‘s

usually because we need them." .

Eartsiveun his players plenty of playing time. and although he concedes it
might hurt the team every now and then. he feels it can only help in the future.
And the loss of seniors Pat Dwyer. Chuck Durgin and Mike Ferris to
graduation this year will certainly hurt the squad. but Earl remains

run it well and rwe work very hard at it." it certainly came ill handy Sunday

After gaining the serve the Danes reeled off the next six noints in a row to
claim the victory. and later, the match.

It was not. however. the first time the Spikers have had to come from
behind this year. They've done it many times already though not quite as
dramatically as Sunday night's victory. it was almost typical.

Probably the most signiﬁcant victory this year was the one over Army
February l2. Only a year ago. Albany wasjust happy to be playing on the
same court as the West Pointers. But this year it has been different A 15—4
record against some tough competition is nothing to sneer at. And Earl. like
an excited father, is happy for his "kids." l-le‘ll tell you about them. too,
“You‘ve got to give them a lot of credit."
