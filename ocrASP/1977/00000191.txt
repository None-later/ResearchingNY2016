to tie the game at II. The Danes
fi ally tookthe and went ontoa
lS-IZ victory.

sound volleyball club. We got off

angle shots and cross—court moves,
but after the adjustment. we played
our game and won the match," said
Albany Coach T d Earl after the
match.

Stickmen Ready; Open Season Saturday

by Eddie Emerman

The members of the Albany State
varsity lacrosse team will have to
wait an extra day to start their
'vacations as the team opens its l977
season with a home game against Os-
wego State~this Saturday.

First-year Head Coach Michael
Motta is optimistic about the up-
coming season. “T he team is looking
pretty good right now. The weather
has hurt us a bit but we'll be ready for
Saturday‘s game." said Motta.

Leading the Danes' offense will be
Terry Brady and Dan Goggin. both

' attackmen. Brady. one of the team's

three captains. will be playing his
.iurth season. He led the team last
an in scoring and Motta feels

.trady is the team's best player.
Goggin. a junior. is also a great

offensive threat. Two years ago he
scored 27 goals; a school record that
still stands.

Jay Kianka. Tom Granziose. and
Bill Schmohl will be the midﬁelders.
Kianka. a senior. is also a tri-
captain. Last year he was named to
the All‘East team. Motta called
Kiaiika a great “all-around" player.

Schmohl and Granziosc are se-
cond and third-year players, respec-
tively. and Malta is hoping to get

.good performances from them.

The defense is in good shape. ac-
cording to Malta. Joe Mullin and
Dave Ahomen will both be playing
in their fourth seasons. Mullin. the
third captain on the team, has been
plagued with injuries in the past but
Motta feels he will be line for the
season. -.

The goalie position is still up in the
a “It‘s a toss-up between Gary
Miller, ajunior. and WillvDraughon.
i freshman.“ said Motta.

Motta feels this could be the
Danes' year. "If we put together
what we have with the amount of
seniors we have. we should do it."

One problem the team has is lack
of depth. Motta indicated that the
team wasn‘t deep in any of the
positions and that could hurt them.

Last year the Danes finished with
a 7-5 record, good for second place
in the Northern New York League,
Motta feels the toughest competition
this year will come from Geneseo
(who finished first last year) and
Brockport. Outside the league, Un-‘
io . CW. Post and Colytte will be
the top competitors for the Danes.

the first game. 15-].

Coach Earl substituted for his en-
tire starting team. in the second
game and the replacements played
well in tting together a 15-9 vic-
tory, “The substitutions were made
so that those players without game
experience could go out and play
togehter on the court as what is es-
sentially next year‘s team." said Earl.

The final opponent for the spikers
was a tough NJlT team. Danes
dropped the first game l5-9. “We ran
into an experienced team with one
superb player. and we got some
tough breaks. all of which added up
to the loss.“ commented Earl.

In the second game. Albany was
within one‘point of losing their first
match ofthe day as they trailed l4-IO
with NJlT serving. However, the
Danes won the serve and scored six
straight points for a lb-l4 victory.

The rubber game ofthe match was
tied at seven before Albany pulled
ahead 14-7. NJlT rallied to l4—10,
but finally succumbed lS-l0. giving
Albany the victory and a sweep of
the quadrangular. '

“Mike Ferris was a good example
of team spirit. as he and the rest of
the bench gave important vocal sup-
port during the MIT match. Chuck
Durgin and Andy Kinstler had their
usual steady. solid games, and it was
an overall team effort that won the
match for us." concluded Earl.
