Legislature RejectsManagement Institute

by Jonathan Hodges

the State Legislature last week re~
lectetl SUNYA‘s request for 535.000
to liind the Management Institute. a
program that would have provided
continuing education for many of
the state‘s lower and middle echelon
executives. ’

the institute is one of two
programs that had been scheduled to
hegin SUNYA's new public policy
thrust. its sister proposal. the $70,-
000 Center for Governmental
Research and Services. was ap-
proved.

llie Management Institute is an
till-shoot of a program offered by
SUNY/it‘s Graduate School of
Public Affairs. Since I963. as many
is two to three dozencours‘eshaVe

been made available to both state
and local employees. These courses
ranged anywhere front three days up
to two weeks in length.

The failure to'obtain funding for
the institute comes'tis a setback to
the SUNY Master Plan. in which
SUN YA is projected to emerge as a
major * public. policy center. Public
policy can .bc loosely described as a
plan .‘for; utilizing "the university's
capabilities I to: identify- and suggest
possible remedies  governmental
and social problems.- ' " ' ' ~

“While we weredhappointcd at
the fate of the institute. the principal,

. instrument needed to move forward"
with public policy was the approval-
of the.Center." said Vice President ,

for University Affairs liwiti Weich.

in the funding rejection's accom-

stated that while they “recognize and
support the development of this
program}? the universityshould‘seek
alternate funding.

“‘The money requested would not
have provided total funds for the

Belchcr said the screening process
has not yet been completed. The
committee is expected to make a
report to the Vanderbilt Board of

tiien make the final selection. said
Belclier.

Fields was not available for com-

Welch stated that he was strongly
iii favor of the direction the universi-
ty has taken in regards to public
policy.

“It‘s a logical-development that
each of the various campuses would
begin to utilize their various unique
capabilities." said Welch. “I think
thiit this university was built with the
implicit design of a public policy-
type role in mind." ~

According to Welch. SUNY will
attempt to obtain the necessary fun-
ding for the Management institute
