Manycollcges that moved away
from general-education re-
quirements during the l960's are
now returning to them by way ofin-
stituting distribution requirements.“
General-cducationjs the concept

' that acorc of knowledge and critical

skills are essential as the basis for a
liberal education. Distribution rc-
quiremcnts would specify a number
of humanities. natural and social
science courses to be taken before
graduation. to fulfill tltesc education
goals. i ,

But a belief scents to be growing
that students are not graduating with
this grounding.

Senior SUNYA administratch of-
ficials said students here are
overspccializing in their major field
and graduating with little or no
knowledge of other fields or how
their field relates to others and the
needs of society.

All fields are interrelated. they
said.

The officials added their concern
that students were seeking only easy
courses in an effort to boost grades
and increase chances for employ-
ment upon graduation.

ntittec to Review the Undergraduate

RequirementsAre Growing Trend

.V Experience chaired by Professor

Ray Ortali. is currently assessing
liberal education at SUNYA with a
report expected in the) next few
weeks.

A number of universities have
already assessed the state of liberal
education on their campuses and
acted. .

SUNYA Stony'Brook‘s Arts and
Sciences Senate approved a set of
distribution requirements late last
month to apply to next year's
freshmen.

If the requirements are approved
by Stony Brook President JohnToll.
students will have to take llcredits
each of arts and humanities. soci'II
and behavioral sciences. and natural
science and mathematics. No
courses taken to satisfy major rc-
quiremcnts would be used to satisfy
the requirements. Mathematics.
English. and a foreign language
proficiency would also be required.

Statesman. the Stony Brook stu-
dent newspaper. quoted one Arts
and Scicnccs Senator as saying “I
don‘t see that forcing students to
take courses in understaffed
departments will force them to learn.
I don't think that students having a
liberal education is as intportant as
the quality of education."

 

avor that

Cornell University‘s faculty has

also recently recommended a rc-'

quirement of. ihterdisciplinary
courses outside a major field of study
before graduation.

Former SUNY Chancellor Ernest
Boyer also said he was in favor of
certain core requirements for
graduation. at Senate confirmation
hearings before he becantc U.S.
Commissioner of Education. this
year.

Training for professions may have
become too isolated for realistic
preparation. But the bottom line ac-
cording to Stony Brook history
Professor .Iocl Roscnthal is “it seems
pretty clear tltal the [Stony Brook]
faculty wants distribution re-
quirements and students are goittg to
get distribution requirements.
