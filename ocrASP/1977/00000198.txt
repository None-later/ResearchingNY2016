Wiesel cannot Forget _A useliwitz.

by Bryan Holzberg

“A Jew who forgets is not Jewish.
I cannot forget. No matter what I do.
the fire is still therc."said author Elie
Wicscl before an audience of more
than 800 in the Campus Center
Ballroom Wednesday.

Wiesel recalled how when to years
hld. he. his family. and the Jews of
his small Transylvanian village were
deported to the Auschwitz concen~
traiion camp. They did not know of
German atrocities being committed
in that spring of I944.

“We didn't know what it meant.
And then someone told us ‘this is
trulh‘. We said to ourselves. One
doesn't do these things. the world
wouldn‘t let it. We thought no one
knew.“

Wicscl remembers. He is i
soltspokcn speaker who uses strong
wards to tcll his story: to make
others understand what happened to
the Jews under Nit/.i pcrsccution.

Numerous essays and books have
been written by the Boston Universi-
ty professor. all touching in some
manner on encountering death and
reaffirming life.

“I usually cannot speak on this

ot be communicated through

ords.“

Yet he tries although saying “all
this I don‘t understand. _

“What is the meaning.“ he asked.
not understanding why God aban-
doned Jews to the death camps. why
the killers were predominantly the
educated.

Wiesel cannot be silent. "in times
of crisis. no one may be neutral as it
helps the killer.“ he said.

Titles of mass atrocities were
related; all remembering the victim‘s
silcnt suffering. all surrounded by
apologies for telling them. “I
speak not of anger. but of
hope.Whal are we if not a memory
that contains the future.“

Wiesel was sponsored by Jewish
Students Coalition and Speakers
Forum as the keynote speaker iii a
20-hour vigil to remember the
Holocaust Yom Hashoah v and
protest treatment of Soviet .lcwry to-
day.

He was physically tired at a recep—
lion following the talk. Leaning
against windows from which one
could see the continuing vigil in front

of the Campus Center. Wiesel spoke
low. politely responding to
handshakes. autographs. “thank-
yous".

“l have a relative who survived
Auschwitz." said one anxious stu-
dent

Wiesel interrupted asking him.
i‘What is his name“ and pressed for
more information. as he seemed to
gather strength. He spoke of Jewish
i'csilcncy and optimism although

- strongly colored by his own suffering

and anguish.

But Wiesel was reaching out in
stark contrast lothc vigil ol'which he
said he would “spend btit a few
moments."

llc displayed moments ofdcspcra-
tion as he talked of continuing Nazi
movements in the United States. He
expressed amazement when recently
a Milwaukee .lcw sued two Nazis for
attacking him and some 27 witnesses
called before the court said they
know little of Hitler or what Nazism
stood for.

“What do we do when faced with
such obscentity‘? Nothing is more
vicious than to deprive the dead of
their own death."

cics have tripled since the program‘s

“beginning. “A lot of little agencies

are dying to get students an’d never
get thcln."'l‘hcrc is one agency which
has more students applying than it
can ever possibly use. Who else but
Albany Medical Ccntcr‘.’ O\er
cigth want to get in. it accepts thirty
and only one gets to work in the
emergency room.

Despite its popularity. the
program probably will not be ex-
panded iii the foreseeable future.
Still. McKinley feels that any stu-
dent who wunts to should be able to
take the program once during their
four years at SUNYA. Problems
arise when students don‘t think ofit
until their senior year and are closed

(“Students usually begin to line tip
at SIX o‘clock the lust morning and
by the time she arrives at 8:30. the
lines extend to the computing center.
The early riscrs are mostly pro-med
students. “They all think they‘re
Marcus \Vclhy. and they all want to
work in the Emergency room." ac-
cording to McKinley.

McKinlcy‘s greatest complaint is
that students don‘t want to work
Willi old people. She feels that
students are “scared ot'thcm". Those
who do try working with senior
Citilcns “love it and stay without
credit". says McKinley.
