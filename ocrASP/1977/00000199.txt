Most people think television news
is entenainingand reassuring. and

few viewers decide which program to -

watch because of “new quality” con-
cludes Dr. Mark R. Levy. a lecturer
in sociology at State University of

New York at Albany. after a two-

ycar study of the audience for local

and network television 'news
programs. -

“Being informed is only a secon-
dary motive for most viewers." Levy
said. “Most people watch tv news to

.be amused and diverted. or to make
sure that their homes and families
are safe and secure.“

Noting that media critics and
working jounalists often condemn
"‘happy talk“ news. Levy, a former
broadcast newsman himself, pointed
our that two-tliirds-of the viewing
audience say that newscasters‘ jokes
“make the news easier to take."
'i'hree-quarters ofthc public saytliey
like tv news because it is often very
"funny." and more than half of all
viewers say watching the news on
television “helps them relax.“ Forty
per cent ofpeople who watch the late
evening news say it actually helps
them fall asleep.

"Even better educated viewers
look to tv news for entertainment
and reassurance." Levy said. “Peo-
ple who have gone tocollcge saythcy
dislike “silly anchorman. but college
grad uates still enjoy "sophisticated"
news stories and "clever" commen-
tators.

Despite tv‘s heavy emphasis on
"bad" news. many people find the
newscasts comforting. Sixty percent
of viewers say tv news makes them
realize their own lives are not so biid.
and one-third said watching the
news makes them feel “more secure
and reassured."

“If ‘bad' news is happening to
someone else or sonteone you can‘t
identify with. then it can make you
feel better.“ Levy said.

According to the-study. the quali-
ty ol'the newscast plays little part in a
program‘s popularity. One-third of
viewers choose their local news
program because of the entertain-
ment show which preceeds or follows
the news. The nexrmost common
reason is liking the anchorman. wigh
about twenty per cent of the local
news audience and forty per cent of
people who watch network news
deciding on that basis. Fewer than
one viewer in ten said “news quality"
was his or her prime reason for tun-
ing in.

Levy's findings are based on face-
to-facc interviews with a
scientificrilIy-seiected sample of 240
adults in Albany County. New York.
conducted during October and
November. I975. ‘l he study was sup-
ported by rr research grant front the
National Association of Broad-

casters.

“I am sorry to say it. but having
Merv Griffin or Johnny Carson on
your channel. or having it ‘eclebrity‘
news-reader appears to be a stronger
guarantee of higher ratings than do-
ing a good job of journalism." Dr.
Levy noted.

Reflecting recent controversies
over television news. almost half of
the public thinks the newscasts are “a
little unfair." and seventy per cent of
viewers say tv news "over-
dramatizes" its reports. Almost
seventy per cent also believe that

television news does not provide
enough background information on
complicated. important issues.

ACID RAINS

A study by Cornell University has
discovered that severe “Acid Rains"
are wiping out the fish and other
marine life in the lakes of upstate
New York. Cornell researchers
report that since l930. the deadly
rainfall has killed off all fish life in
more that 90 percent of the Adiron-
dack lakes. Acid rain. they say. is
caused by sulfur and other industrial
pollutants in the atmosphere com-
bining with moisture in clouds to
create acidic raindrops.

STATUS STAINING

One of the newest things in fadtee
shirts these days is the “status stain
shirt." This bit of clothing has
replaced such gimmicks as ad logos
or pictures on shirts of honest-to-
goodness food stains. The pre-
stained shirts crime equipped with
unsightly blotclies across the front.
which are clearly labeled “ Mustard".
“('alsiip". or "liatiiburger". depen-
ding on your choices. Some of the
stiohbier shirts feature only the fittest
iii stains. from red i‘rcnch wines to
genuine caviar marks.

()nc of the creators of the stain—
wcar. ('ina liodges of West
Hollyuood. reports the only corti-
plaints thus far have come from
health-lood enthusiasts, Says
iiotigcs: “They are demanding eqtial
time for high-protein drink stains
and soyburgcr drips."

is the natural “reservoir” for the

animals might eradicate the disease.

Besides. he adds. pigs aren't like

A number oi‘cy'nics’ hisvejoked for

years that solar energy will be widely ,, v

available as soon as the major cor}
porations ﬁgure out a way to “own”
the sun. Now. a San Francisco

energy research group knownasThe 

Solar Center is warning that the day
of the sun being “owned” and sold
may have arrived.

Researchers Peter Barnes and
John Geesman report that the
California Energy Commission and
the state‘s public utilities commis-
sion have been holding a series of
hearings. discussing how private
utility companies can move ona ma-
jor scale into the solar energy field.

According to Barnes and
(iecsman. the proposal currently un-
der discussion would empower gas
and electric companies to own and
install the solar collectors placed on
the rooftops of American homes.
The energy gathered by these collec-
tors. the proposal suggests. would
tlten be sold to homeowners at it
price based on the sky-rocketing
costs of natural gas.

Barnes and (icesman say that the
idea behind the proposal is to in-
terest utility companies in solar
energy by offering promises of in-
creased profits. However. they con-
tend the net resuil will be that solar
energy will eventtialiy be controliec
and sold by the same corporations
that already control most of tire
world‘s energy.

One reason is Hoistra's distingurshed lacul-
ty. Another. is its outstanding library resources.

Conference. For others. It is special workshops
and Institutes Ior teachers. For most. It is Hot-
slra's wide variety of more than 450 courses In
every academic area—courses for credit or
non-credit. classes given during the day or
at night. ' ‘

A Holstra summer can be a fascinating pre-

plan to color college next fall. For undergradu-
ates. it can be a useful season to earn extra
credits or to take courses not available at other
times. For graduate students. a summer at Hot-
sira can bring the completion of a degree much
closer And Ior still others. there are many
opporlunilics for personal growth through con-
taining education. .

It depends on what "life" means.

For most of us, life is a goodjob. a good house. a good
car...and If we're lucky. a good marriage.

For some (and perhaps for you) this Is not enough. The
“good life" somehow to not enough. Life must mean some-
thing dlflerent: the attempt to live in union with God. to serve
others. to give as totally and as generously as you can.

The Paullsts offer a way of life which can satisfy young men
who seek more than the "good life." As a small community
of Catholic priests. we have worked for over a century
throughout the United States and Canada ——from Manhattan
to Toronto. from Greensboro to Houston. from Loc Angela
to Fairbanks. Our mission? To speak the message of Jesus
Christ to this modern world: to communicate His shattering
love and overwhelming forgiveness In a time and world where

To do so. we are actively Involved in parish work. preach-
Ing. adult education. campus ministry, publishing and mass
communications. We are missionaries; we are bridge-
buliders. We seek to serve the Gospel in ever new ways.

The Paullst life is not an easy one. But one who dares will
find rewards beyond expectation. satisfactions beyond
dreams. But not complete satisfaction. for we are constantly
searching to make the Gospel real to more people in today's
