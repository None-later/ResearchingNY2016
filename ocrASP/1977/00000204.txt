that there are I9 essential vitamins and
minerals in Product I9. A thorough

answers are incorrect. Surprisingly, the
true answer is the most obvious one.

of copying out the works of any composer
be admired and preserving these for his
own instruction. This practice led in later
years to failing eyesight. In I749, an un—
successful operation left him totally
blind.

He once travelled 30 miles on foot to
hear the old master of his day, Dietrich
Buxtehude. perform on the organ. Like
his famous contemporary Handel. Bach
turned down a lucrative position when in-
formed that one of its conditions was
marrying Buxtehude‘s daughter.

Bach‘s contributions to various media
may broadly be categorized by his three
chief places of employment. Weimar saw
the production of many great pieces for
organ. Cothen witnessed the Branden-
burg Concerti. among other chamber
works. At Leipzig. where he spent his last
25 years, Bach composed his greatest
choral compositions. including 200-plus
cantatas. the St. Matthew and St. John
Passion settings. and the Mass in B
Minor.

These last-named choral pieces were
written chiefly to be performed as parts of
actual church ceremonies. Bach‘s
chamber music went totheentertainment
of his royal employers. His voluminous
works for harpsichord. however. were in-
tended lor the education of his sons and

' The Kellogg’s

Consumer Service Divison ofthc Kellogg
('ompany, “We generally try to develop
names for our products which are in some
way descriptive of the product itself. In
the case of Product [9. however. the
situation was a little different. Duringthe
research and development phase. this
cereal was referred to as Prmlm'l [9
because it was the |9th product in the
Kellogg line. When plans for makingihis

pupils.

The Baroque forms with which Bach
worked were brought by him to an une-
qualled state of perfection and emotional
power. He himself did not discover new
forms of music: rather. he represented the
peak of achievement for several older
forms simultaneously.

Era‘s End

Bach‘s death brought the Baroque era
to an end. His own sons moved on to the
secular concerns of the so-called classic
period.expcrimcnting with Italian sonata
