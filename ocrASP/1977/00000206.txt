To the Editor:

I would like to say that your treatment of
Natch Amcricans was appalling. I do not
think you have any idea of how Native people
think or talk. If you had taken anthropology
and linguistics courscs l atn sure yott would
not havc madc suclt outrageous statements.
even in jest.

More is a short coursc in Mohawk
linguistics. Mohawk has no bilabials likc p
and In. You would. however. find these sounds
in Algonquin“ languagcs. if you Wcrc a
sophisticated anthropologist. you would
know that Moltawk pcoplc were not called
lint/kilos or names referring to thcsc animals.
liufl'alos were not natiyc to thc homeland of
the Iroquois pcoplcs.

l aitt a Natch American. The picture you
madc fun of happens to he onc of my clan

arc tattght to respect pcoplc in these offices.

Although \vc livc in the year l977. it sccnis
that most pcoplc hung think Nativc pcoplc

You arc mum in modern times. Wc may sectn

On Striking Back . A. .

A strike, especially involving a violation of the Taylor law. can result
in an extremely delicate situation. And in such a case it is generally a wise
idea' to avoid matching tactics with the union. ‘

In the increasingly probable event of a Civil Service Employers
Association strike on Monday morning. the union will actively try to in-
sure that SUNYA is closed down by manning picket lines at university
entrances, and through the support of the Teamsters and the U nited U n-
iversity Professions.

According to Vice President for University Affairs Lewis Welch, “The
first priority of the administration is to keep the university functioning
as an educational facility." Dodging picket lines with a National Guard
escort might be considered educational if SUNYA were a school for ur-
ban guerillas. But in any battle between the administration and the un-
ion, the only surc losers are going to be students. I

If the proposed strikc does occur. the bcst course of action the ad-
ministration could takc would be a shutdown of the university and a
concentration on negotiations rather than combat strategies.

As for students ~ thcy'rc caught in the middle here, being used by the
administration to thwart the union. and by the CS EA to pressure the un-
ivcrsity. ’l'hcir wiscst course of action is simply to stay home.

. . . And Moving Back

Perhaps bcttcr known for Easter and incomplctcs. April is also the
month for SA elections and next y‘ar‘s cxcctttivc budgct. But it
shouldn‘t hc.

With clcctions in the last week of April. the newly elected officers only
have two wccks to tap the brains of the outgoing officials. 'l'hcy‘rc then
left to fend for themselves in the wilds of SA‘s chaotic bureaucracy.

Elcctions carlicr in thc scmcstcr. around mid February. would be a
signifi ‘ant improvement. New officials would then havc over two 4
months to fch their way into their positions with thc help of their
pt‘cdcccssors. iai‘licr clcctions would also assure SA of a summcr of
productivity rathcr than a pcriod of training.

SA‘s hudch is also a factor hcrc. Presently. the new administration
must labor undcrthc old administration‘s budget. Il'his situation clcarly
should not exist. Moving the clcction date back to February would give
thc ncw prcsidcut some time to settle in before having to prcparc a
budget for thc ncw fiscal year.
