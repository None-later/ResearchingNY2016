cd'in. Here are a few brief notes
about the new sport:

i. It is played with nine men onthe
field at one time so eachteam should
have about I3-l5 people showing up
for each game.

2. Paddle hockey is played on a
lacrosse-style field: the players use
paddle ball racquets and try to pass
and hit a tennis ball into a goal
guarded by the opposing team's
goalie. who is equipped with a tennis
racquet and a glove. (All equipment
will be supplied by AMIA). The

rudimentsvof the game will be ex-

plained there and the teams will

scrimmage one another. Referees
\will be paid in the $2.50 range per
game and can be trained during the

Saturday clinic.

2:00 am. any night of the week or

State university of New York.at
Albany's veteran track and field
coach Bob Munscy feels the key toa
successful season for the Great
Danes will lie in the experience and
depth\of the distance and mid-
distanee runners.

I “We have morepeople out for
those events: than any -' other."

Munscy said; “We have a strong'cor-i

awfully good.” .

Sophomore Steve Williams is the
only returning intermediate hurdler
Munscy has. “We've got three
freshmen." he says. “who are coming
offsthe indoor track season: Tom
Fischer. .lim Cunningham. and Don
Dross." Munscy feels Dross has out-
standing potential not only in the in-
termediate hurdles. but also the high
hurdles. the 440. and the long and
triple jumps.

"Most of the kids will switch
between the high and intermediate
hurdles." Munsey’said.

“I think we‘re in pretty good shape
in the dashes." the coach noted.
Senior Orin Griffin who qualified
for the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships last year will be the leader.

Munscy is also expecting
sophomore Dan Ducadyto perform
well. “The key to ottr success in the
dashes.“ Munscy says. "is held by
our freshmen. Benny Smith. Mike
Simmonds. both sub lOsccond men

in the tan and Darrell Grant will be ‘

the bulwark.

The jumpers will be led by senior
