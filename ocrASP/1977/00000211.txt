f Although George Steinbrenner
might not understand the economics

team: nevertheless “acquired” three -

promisingpitchers over the winter at
“a minimum ofcost to provide coach
Bob Burlingame with what should

be one of the strongest staffs in his-

lti-year Albany coaching career.

“Our pitching depth has to be the _

biggest factor." said Burlingame
when asked his appraisal of the spr-
ing team.. “With that and our
catching depth. that should be the
difference between the spring and
fall seasons.“

The Great Danes finished with a
disappointing 4-l0 won-lost mark
last fall. But that was without new-
comers Eddie Sellers and Lynn

whom saw fall pitching duty.

Besides the pitchers. Burlingame
also has a strong receiving corps on
his 24-man roster. “Mike Mirabella
is our number one catcher and Rick

Mirabella led the team in runs

with five while freshman Cardillo is
coming off a .412 fall season~good
enough to lead the team. And both
are very good defensively as well.

Anchoring the infield will be All-
SUNYAC second baseman Jeff
Silvcrman who batted an impressive
.36l against conference foes in the
fall. Around at third base will be the
team's Most Valuable Player, Jim
Willoughby. “Willow” led the club
with 25 fall RBl'ii to go along with
his .320 batting average. Willoughby
and Dollard. both seniors. will beco-
captains of this semester's squad.

Averting Monday Strike

by David Sylvester

A strike by some l.l00 SUNYA
workers was averted Sunday mor-
ning when negotiatiors for the Civil
Service Employees Association and
the State of New York reached an
agreement calling for it 14 per cent
pay increase over two years.

According to CSEA Local 69i
President Arthur Burt. had there not
been a settlement Sunday. the l 100

bus drivers would not have reported

in addition. Hurt said. both
the Teamsters Union and the
Amalgamated Transit Workers Un-

strikers. “The strike would have
forced the university to shut down."
he said.

and non-teaching professionals. said
'that in the event of a strike by CSEA

however. that “UUP members were
not to perform any functions nor-
mally assigned to CSEA workers.“

Specifically the new contract gives
CSEA workers a pay increase of five

when the union‘s contract expired. in
additionao a four per cent or $400
raise on Oct. l. I977.

The new contract. which stretches

NYPIRG DNA Forum Rejected

by Jonathan Hodges

SUNYA's Council on Research
rejected a NYPIRG offer to co-
sponsor an open forum on the safety
of recombinant DNA techniques last
Wednesday.

NYPlRG‘s offer. which was
planned to publicly examine the en-
vironmental and social dangers of
bio-research utilizing recombinant
DNA techniques. was rejected due to
the council‘s interpretation of
SUNYA President Emmett Fields
charge to the council.

“There was a great deal of senti-
ment on the council that any forum
that was sponsored had to deal less
with the social issues and more with
the scientific aspects.“ said Vice
President for Research William
ilcdbcrg.

“Right now. the council is plan-
ning two separate forums. One. to be
held ill the next week or ten days. will
feature it film. a lecture. and a ques-
tion and answer periodzThe other.
to be held within a week after the
first. will be a panel discussion con-
cerning the level of research to be
conducted at this university.“

According to Hedberg. the coun~
cil's chief objection to the NYPIRG

SUNVA President Emmett Ftet

proposal was their choice of op-
patients to the research techniques
that are scheduled to begin at
SUNYA within the next few weeks.

"We had talked to Hcdbcrg on
Monday. and he initially said it
would be a good idea." said NYP-
lRG State Board representative
Adrienne Rudman. “Then he called
back on Tuesday and said that be
had gotten some feedback and that
the forum was off. I know that
[Biology Department Chairman
Leonard] Lerman really objected to
the type offorum we had proposed."

Rudman stated that NYPIRG is
planning to host a forum ofits own.
with next Tuesday set as it tentative
date.

“We‘ve contacted opponents
Jonathan King from M.l.'|'.. and
Francine Simring. a member of
Friends ofthe Eitrth."siiid R udman.
“There is a good chance that one or
both will attend. We're having a lot
of trouble getting pro speakers. es-
pecially since it is now not it universi-
ty sponsored forum."

Yet according to several university
community members. there are
other factors involved in NYPlRG's
difficulty to obtain proponents for a

debate on the environmental and
social impact of recombinant DNA
bio-research techniques.

“They might have some difficulty
getting people who would want to
speak alongside the opponentsthey
are inviting." said Lcrmdn. who
declined an offer by NYPIRG to
speak next Tuesday. “For our
forum. we have asked. and it looks
very hopeful. that we will have a
speaker of national prominence
comding down from Washingtomto
speak."

The basic conflict between the
council and NYPIRG is on how
limited the discussion should be on
an issue that has already seen local
newspapers and legislators take
stands against SUNYA‘s plans to
begin such work.

When asked why the scope of
forums were so limited. Lerman
answered. “We don't believe that
there are any social issues.“

He immediately qualified that
statement by adding that.“Thc
biology department is deeply aware
of its social responsibility in regards
to informing the community of the
work being performed at SUNYA.
but we don‘t believe that many

rDNA Research To Beginl

Research using recombinant DNA techniques will soon begin on
campus. as the SUNYA Biohazards Committee approved a research
proposal submitted by Biology Professor Joseph Masearenhas.

The work will be done in a lab which provides Pl (minimum) con-
tainment against escaping microbes. Mascarenhas' present lab will be
converted within the next few weeks and research is scheduled to begin

“Right now I‘m just waiting for a carpenter to arrive.‘
Mcscarenhas. who is engaged in isolating nitrogen fixation genes.

The construction of the Pl facility is a new development in an issue
that is surrounded by controversy. Up until the approval of the new
facility. the only lab authorised for construction was a P2 (minimal)
containment laboratory where the bulk of the work would be con-

lii the committee's minutes of March 23. Biology Professor Richard
Zitomer argued that the two facilities were needed because in his opi-
nion. toconduct both levels of work in a P2 facility could only tend to
increase the problem of containing any potential hazards.

“I felt that all research ofthis nature should be done in the P2 facili-
ty.“ said committee chairman Richard Kelly. who cast the only "no"
vote against the proposed Pl laboratorystatingthat “any proliferation
of sites of activity was undesirable."

“i know what's going to happen.“ said Kelly. “First the committee
will grant one such facility. Then another. Until pretty soon there are
