The recent posting of No smoking

' slowdown in the rim step

toward banningcigarette smoking in
all classrooms. according to Anit-

j tent Vice President for University af-
fairs Sorrell Cbesin.

Five-hundred signs. saying
“Please Do Not Smoke” in seven
languages. were posted in every

classroom by the Plant department
_ last week.

Until ofﬁcial policy is initiated.
though. the main deterrent against
smokingwill be verbal complaints.
from those annoyed by the smoke.
Chesin said.

“Students will have to start letting
smokers know that smoking is often-
sive and that it infringes on their
rights." he said.

The ban is being phased in slowly.

Studént Security

by Teri Holbrook

The SUNYA student escort
patrol. created to combat the rise of
tin-campus crime. will begin service
starting tomorrow night.

The patrol. which will be in effect
for the rentainder of the semester. is
being coordinated by three student
supervisors who will oversee the
operation.

Presently. plans call for the stu-
dent patrols to learns of two
students. with one team assigned to
one of four quadrants. A quadrant is
composed of a quad. a parking lot.
and a section of the podium. Ad-
ditionally. a team will patrol the
downtown camptrs.

The patrols will operate seven
days a week. Sunday through Thurs-
day between the hours of 7:30 pm.
to |:30 am. The Weekend hours are
front 7:30 pm. to 2:30 am.

The student patrolers will be iden-
tified by a clearly visible identifica-
tion card and will be armed with a
\vulkie-talkie and a ﬂashlight. The
teams will be escorting women on
campus grounds. responding to
reports of injury and illness. repor-
ting safety hazards. noting tire
harards and conditions of tire ex-
tinguishers. answering students'
questions about the role and nature
of Public Safety ol'ltcers' duties. and
making referrals to Middle Earth
and l‘l\‘t.' Quad.

tolved in any incidents. bill will

ing out on the campus grounds and
reporting actual or potential errnies
and mischievous behavior.

Chesin explained. because the ad-
ministration feels enforcement
procedures are still “hazy.”

“We want to approach it in a
human way first, but request that
students consider the rights of
others. Formalizing regulations re-
quires plans for enforcement."

“It's a question of whether to
adopt a regulation that isn‘t en-
forceable." .

One suggested plan is to have
faculty members instructed to “re-
mind” students not to smoke. “We
don‘t want them to have to be en-
forcers though. The situations could
get bizarre."

Student Activities chairperson
Pat Buchalter echoed this problem.
“We don't know where to begin en-
forcement. What if faculty members
don‘t comply?

" We can legislate and mandate
forever. but without faculty iind stu-
dent help. it‘s useless.“

"smoking 

 

science student at SUNYA. has
become impatient. He will be'pass-
ing anti-smoking petitions across the
community shortly.

“The signs are a start, but they
don't’have a strong impact,” Bailey
said. ' .

“I‘m not sure that the university
has made a strong commitment.”

“Thelpetition Would be helpful in

describing breadth of support for a
smoking limitation policy.“ Presi-
dent Emmett Fields wrote to Bailey.
He promised to give the petition “ap-
propriate weight" in formulating the
policy. -
The purpose of Bailey‘s petition is
three-fold. “I want to increase the
students‘ awareness of‘t'he smoking
problem. apply more pressure to
those making decisions. and gain
support for the stopping of
classroom smoking.

“Hopefully. this will urge an im-
plementation of a system beginning
next semester,“ Bailey said. E‘

A recent Planned Parenthood
study of" student income and clinic
fees revealed some interesting
statistics on awareness of incomes
and clinic fees.

The study was initiated to see ifall
teenagers, whatever family income.
should have access to subsidized
birth control services.

Since the average teenager and

 

Edi!ur'.i‘ Note: From I’larm'ed

Parent/laud of America

student is unlikelyto ask for parental
money for contraceptive services.
family income is irrelevant to it
teenager's ability to pay for such ser-
vices.
Tri-State Survey

The New York. New Jersey, Con-
neticut survey revealed that 40 per
ceiit of those questioned did not
know their parent‘s income level. 84
per cent reported regular income of
their own (through employment or
other means). and 57 per cent had

bought one or more of a tape system,

radio. car. stereo, sewing machine.

or guitar. with their own money.
Teenagers '

The study suggested teenage and
student patients be treated as single
persons living in single-person
households or in two-person
households ~— married). In conclu-
sion. the illustrative clinic fee scale
which accompanies this study. was
deemed appropriate for such
patients.

Bomb Scare Hits Indian Quad

by Jackie Leffert

“This makes three bomb scares in
one week.“ said Lt. David
l’rendergast. referring to the threat
on SUNYA‘s uptown dormitory
complex. Indian Quadrangle. last
Thursday night. Downtown dor~
rrritories. Waterbury and Aldeitcacli
recetvud threats earlier last week.

Although all of the callers were
titalc. campus security (Department
of Public Safety) does not believe the
calls are related. “Thch scent to be
different patterns." said
l’rentlcrgust.

Indian Quad Residence Hall
Dircctor Lenny I‘raviglionc received
I'Iiursday night's call. “The phone
rang about 12:12 am.“ he said. "I
answered it and the caller said there
would be a bomb going off in
Adirondack. Tuscarora arid Onon-
daga at I230.“

Iravlglronc called security and the
power plant. and agreed to meet at a
designated place. It was his decision
to t'HICllIlIL' thcthrcatctied buildings.
Since alarms sounding in one dorm

automatically set off the alarms in
adjoining buildings. most of the
quad was evrtcuated. Traviglione
directed studentstothe basements of
Mahican and Montauk. two un-
threatened buildings.

"The Resident Assistants (RA's)
rind students were just great." he

' said. “The RA‘s knew what they had

to do and they did it efficiently. The
students were calm. When there‘s a
fire alarm. and they don‘t know ifit‘s
a drill or not. the general reaction is
‘Whitt's going on'." Here. we told
them wltat was happening altd they
took it seriously."

“In a situation like this. security
takes over as snort rrs they arrive."
said Resident Ha‘ Director Joan
Noble. “Once the dorms are
evacuated. the staff hits to leave too."

In this case. t'our security men
were sent to search for the explosive.
“We only had abottr l5 minutes to
search." said l’rcntlct'gast. “When it
got to he l2:31l.tlt1tl there wasn't arty
action. we were pretty sure there
wasn't it bomb.“

After people from power plant
reset the building alarms. around
l:I5. students were allowed to re-
enter the dorms.

This occtirance and the other
bomb threats are under investiga-
tion." said l’rcndergast. “The threat
is a Class H misdemeanor.
punishable by tip to it six monthij
sentence. arid or a litre as high as 500
dollars."

u'llicsc arc thc first calls of this
semester." he continued. “We usual-
ly get these scares rtt certain times of
the year usually during final ex-
aitis atid normally in the academic
btiildings by kids who want to dis-
l'tipt Icsts. l‘hey should realile that‘s
It's no joke."

'l'raviglionc said “Bestdes in-
conveniencing people. this type of
tlting leads the way to all kinds of
trouble. Whenever a large number of
people have to evacuate an area
quickly. there‘s potential for injury

people could ia‘ll down stairs. for
example. Everybody is put into
jeopardy.“
