(SASU) Some schools will gain a few
dollars and others will lose a few
compared to current funding for
SUNY next year in the new state
budget. The real news for students,
though. is that a ttew student health
fee appears likely to cost them up to
Sl5 next semester in new charges.

The state budget calls for a man-
dantory I5 dollar healthfce pers u-
dent. but SUNY officials have said
they will fight to stop it.

SUNY official Herb Gordon conv
tacted SASU to say that State Un-
iversity has not been consulted on
the health fee and does not favor it.
SUNY and SASU may organize a
campaign to have the costs covered
by the Supplemental budget to be
prepared before the end of the
current legislative session.

In other budget matters. the State
legislature approved the restoration
of $25.! million for the Tuition
Assistance Program. The Equal Op-
portttnity Program is still 3500.000
in the hole from last year. but the
prospects are rated good for restora-
tion of that money in the
Supplemental Budget.

l9 schools lost monies from last
year‘s budget while I2 schools had
their appropriations increased.
mostly for inflation. Overall,
however. there have been few
changes. Cith University of New
York picked up $5 million ofthe SIO
million increase it had asked for.
SUNY Central Administration will
be appropriated “60.000 less than
last year.

SUNY is appropriated 3645.476.-
200 for l977-78, a small increase
over last year‘s $644.2l7.000 ap-
propriation. The state's total budget
for next year is $1 |.4(l6,000.000.
State taxpayers will enjoy a small in-
come tax break this year amounting
about $I2 per rate payer.

them with a free dinnerdhat nights~ '
We have housing available for free in
residence for them. We were ready to -

Following are the excerpts from
this week‘s Straight/inc show on
WSUA 640 AM. Host Dan Gaines
spoke to the Director of the Off—
Camptts Student Association, Bud-
dy Voit, and the Director ofthe Off-
Campus Housing Office. Karline
Karlson. The former organization is
a Student Association group, the
latter an arm of the university‘s
housing ofﬁce.

Gaines: There have been tt number
all/ire} in the homes and apartments
oj‘of/lrttntpus students. Is this a new
problem?

Karlson: I don‘t think it's a new
problem. But it's something we are
attempting to help alleviate through
the education of students——as to
what apartments they should rent.
what safety things they should be
looking at. when an apartment
doesn‘t have two outlets in every
room. where there isn't a separate
entrance and egress. when there are
simply not conditions that meet
housing code standards. We are en—

couraging them not to rent these
kind of apartments. '
But there is a problem in Albany.

Housing is at an emergency level.)
\There is only a two per cent vacancy
'of apartments. Alt is much more dif-
ficult to get housing in Albany than
in a typical college town. So some
students have to settle for substan-
dard housing.

Gaines: Do you know what has caus-
ed these ﬁres?

Knrlson: As a rule. they seem to be
electrical—or a furnace . . . in the
case of the Western Avenue ﬁre. an
electrical spark touched it off. In
another fire we have heard it was
children playing with matches . . .
Gaines: What does your ojﬂce offer
students who have been left
home/es: after a fire in their
apartment? '~

Karlson: We can link them up with
the American Red Cross. to get them
emergency clothing for free. With
the fire that occurred on Allen Street
in January. Chapel House provided

deal with any need they had at that
moment.

Gaines: Did marry of them use those
services?

Karlson: Out of about- twenty
students, only three contacted our
office. So we feel more students need

_ to be made aware ofthe fact that our

office can assist them when adisaster
does occur.
Gaines: Buddy. would you compare
the Off-Campus Student Associa-
tion with quad boards? '
Volt: It's not an equivalent ofa quad
board. Quad Boards respond to
social needs and a few service needs.
The aims of OCA are basically ser-
vices, with an eye on the social
events. While we‘re running the
social events. we‘re also getting the
programs out.

One of the problems of off-
campus housing is that students will
compromise themselves in an apart-

ment. They‘re afraid there won't be
enough left. because they hear that
everyone else is lookingfor an apart-
ment. so they‘ll take an apartment
that doesn‘t have a back staircase.
they‘ll take one that doesn't have a
window in the bedroom. and when
they get a fire they can‘t escape.
We‘ve been lucky so far—some peo-

ple have been injured seriously. but
nobody has been killed.
Gaines: What are the responsibilities
of the Off-Campus Housing Office?
Knrlson: We are an administrative
office. which obviously makes us
different from the OCA. We have
certain responsibilities. such as the
