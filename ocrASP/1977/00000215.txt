Gaines: Is there discrimination in

Knrlson: Yes. Students are amazed
to find out they can be discriminated

asked the manthere ifl am nstudent.

This is a very common concern of

There has been very little attempt

Gaines: Do you know why they

Karlson: I don‘t know if it‘s a
political football they don't want to
play with. or because ofthc political
pressure that has been brought on
them because of the substandard
housing they have allowed to exist
and to be rented—they have too
many more important tliingsto deal

the case.
Voit: We see it as something the
landlord is responsible for. When
people want to go into an apartment
with more than three people we
suggest that everybody who is going

Gaines: What have students done to
the homing market here?

Kulson: They have glutted it. If we
think back to over ten years ago.
when the South Mall got started and
what was the state teacher's college
became SUNYA. The South Mall
removed a lot of the low income
housing. and the university quin-
topled in a period oftive or six years.
and suddenly the low income hous-
ing that used to be available is no
longer. And then students started
coming in and taking over the se-
cond half ol'a two family house. and
able to pay far more money than a
typical family could.

Gaines: You're setting up a

in the community. When a person
