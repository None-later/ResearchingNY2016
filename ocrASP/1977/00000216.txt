EMMY BOYCOTT

Some of the biggest names in

television are boycotting next

month‘s Emmy Awards ceremonies
because of the manner in which
many of the winners are selected.
Among those who'say they won't rit-
tend the annual television awards
show or accept a statuette are live-
time winner Mary Tyler Moore.
Carol Burnett. Bob Ncwhart and
Dinah Shore.

The boycotting actors and ac-
trcsscs are upset about the fact that
the Hollywood chapter of the
National Academy of Television
Arts and Sciences is allegedly not be-
ing given it full enough votc iii the
balloting. Hollywood is. in fact. out-
votcd by smaller chapters iti other
parts of the country. Thc Hollywood
contingent is demanding control
over thc selection in many
categories. and tlircatcningto lorni a
separate acadcmy witli its own
award ccrcmonics.

“'llic Wall Street Journal" says
that the boycott has become so
widespread that N.l‘l.('. is even con-
sidering cancelling lL‘lL‘Vl‘alllg the
awards ceremonies. currently
scheduled for May 15th.

ALCOHOL REVIVAL

Alcohol may be making a coni<

percent of the nation‘s gasoline.

said to average 30 to 36 miles per
gallon. whilc sharply improving per-
formance and rcdttcing pollution.

creased availability of" petroleum.
nearly four million European cars
rcportcdly ran on alcohol.

MINI-BRAIN

Now that pocket calculators have
become commonplace. get ready for
the invasion of thc pocket-sized
computers. "The Wall Strcct Jour-
nail" is reporting that. thanks to a

    

cngtttccririg break-
throughs. the American market will,

pockct calculators seem slow and
out-dated by comparison.

Thcsc mini-computers. “The
Journal“ says. will not only be able
to perform complex math problems.
but will also be equipped with
miniature memory units capable of
storing millions of hits of informa-
tion and complex instructions. This
will reportedly enable them toquick-
ly placc in alphabetical order long
lists of names: and even to play
strong games of bridge and chess
against human opponents. ’l‘he
pocket computers are being made
prissihlc. “the Journal" says.
because of the development ol'cxtcn-
siVi: memory units that are one tenth
the site at a human hair.

CONTACT HIGHS

A New York medical rcscarclt
tcarii claims to have uncovered a
potential problem that is likely to
crop up it and when marijuana use is
cvcr Icgali/cd. Thrcc doctors at the
New York Psychiatric Institute in
Manhattan say that human subjects
don‘t liavc to smoke pot in order to
get high. The psychiatrists say they
have discovered that innocent. non-
smoking by-standcrs can get what
arc callcd “contact highs" by
associating with marijuana users as
the latter smoke.

The three doctors say they had
been pu7/lcd by the fact that groups
ol non-pol-smokcrs began to bchavc

strangely after they associated with
pot usch in smoking experiments;
They say that even staff niembcrs
began to show red eyes and com-
plained of unexplained dizziness
after being around pot users. The
psychiatrists say they discovered
that non-smokers can get it “contact
high" by merely brcathingthc air in a
rootii wlicrc pot is smoked. 'l'hcir fin-
ding. they say. means that if mari-
juana is ever legalized. there should
be strict non-smoking areas sct aside
to protect non-tokcrs from what the
doctors call “thc absorption of can-
tiabitioids."

BEATLE BATTLE

The four cx-Bcatlcs have lost a
legal battle aimed at preventing the
rclcasc of a IS—ycar-old live recor-
ding ol the group. A British high
court ruled last week that a mem-
ding of the tour lads lrom Liverpool.
raped in in Hamburg bccr hall during
one ol their concerts in I962. may be
released as an album. The l%2 show
was taped by a long-titiic lricnd ol'
the Beatles. "King Si7c" ’l'iiylor. The
court rtilcd that the former llcatlcs
and Apple Rccords had known
about plans to market the tripe for
years. btit had waitcd too long before
trying to stop it. Ihc alhutti. tillcd
"l'lic llcatlcs l.ch at the Hamburg
