' by Ed Moser
Some of the SA election posters give one
pause. I read one which boasted thecandidate
f'has consistently voted for more money for all
'SA groups”. The key word here is all. If every
SA gIOup deserves more money, then every
government agency in New York City could
make efﬁcient use of a larger budget.

Another poster read. “ . . . did not miss
one meeting or roll call vote of Central
Council“. Somehow perfect attendance
doesn‘t convince me of a council member‘s
effectiveness. More important things like
leadership and influence are involved. As
anyone who has been to a Council meeting
knows. a person with a spotless attendance
record must have a limitless tolerance for
boredom.

The very idea of waging a political
campaign by means of posters is ridiculous. A
poster with a catchy slogan or a brieflisting of
a candidate‘s accomplishments does not
impart enough information to make a rational
judgment of someone‘s candidacy.

Elections bring out the strangeness in

people. Mayor Erastus Corning is up for '

reelection this year. His Albany adminstration
has been criticized for non-enforcement of the
city’s building codes. It's been said that many
housing inspectors are political appointees of
the Mayor.

Non-enforcement means unsuspecting
people continue to live in firetraps. This means
some people die. and some break their legs by
Jumping out the windows of their blazing
apartments. This is called politics.

Charges of non-enforcement could cost
Corning votes. Even a person voting for a
machine has a conscience. The Mayor has to
at least pretend he is enforcing the law. For
political reasons. he might tell his people in the
housing department to step up the number of
their inspections.

This is not completely idle speculation. for
one of the Mayor's enforcers visited my
apartment on Myrtle Avenue the other day.
When I came to answer the doorbell I saw a
bald. old man dressed in a tattered dark
business suit. His white shirt was open at the
collar. he breathed heavily. and his pale face

sa‘gged with age. "

He dutifully told me he was from the
Albany Housing Department. He mistook my
blank stare for non-belief. and dragged out his
identiﬁcation badge. Actually, I was telling
myself that this man was probably responding
to a complaint about garbage being strewn
about the side of our house. The
neighborhood dogs love to knock over our
gash cans.

The man said he was here to make a routine
inspection. The inspection was very routine.
He asked me if the kitchen had hot and cold

' running water. i said'yes. thanking my good
luck for bringing me face-to—face with one of
the legendary irgpectors. He asked me if the
electrical circuits were defective. I said there
was no problem and watched him make little
checkmarks on his clipboard.

He asked if I would mind telling him my
name and the names of my apartmentmates?l
glanced at the sign on our lawn-which said
Reiner Realty on it. “I‘m Rob Reiner." The
others? I turned my head to the road sign
down the streat.-lt said Myrtle Avenue.

“Bob Myrtle. That‘s with ay. notan 1‘. And
that‘s la. not 9/." I had to repeat the spelling of
certain letters several times. for, the old
inspector‘s hearing was not good. I can't
remember the third name I gave him, except
that it was a long Polish name. It took several
minutes for him to get it right.

The residents of the upstairs apartment
weren‘t in. the inspector noted. He would have
frowned if he had any life left in him.

1 told him I could answer' his questions.
Incredibly, he agreed.

I have never been in the upstairs apartment.

l have never discussed its condition with its
occupants. We went through the routine ofthe
running water. the electrical circuits. the
names. Finally. he thanked the and walked
away into the warm spring sunshine.

Later that day I had visions of Mayor
Corning at a press conference. boasting of
progress in housing code enforcement. saying
the number of inspections had increased
dramatically. and winning reelection for the
umptecnth time. ‘

To the Editor:

Every day, hundreds of students shop at the
Food .Co-op. They can get fresh fruits,
vegetables. dairy products, grains. natural and
nutritional foods, and save 15-35% of the
supermarket price. Suites and apartments can
save hundreds of dollars each year in food
costs by shopping at the co-op.

Seventeen months ago they said it couldn't
be done. School administrators said there
wasn't space. UAS said it wasn’t needed. and
some students said it would go bankrupt.

Two students brainstormed the co-op
concept. and researched the practical aspects
of implementation. They then submitted
detailed plans to purchase necessary
equipment. structurally renovated part of the
Campus Center basement. and organized the
co—op. Administrators were impressed. Three
months later. February I976. the Food Co-op
was open for business.

As one of those two students. I‘m proud of
the way the co-op has grown. Today it has a
large variety of items in stock, plans for
further expansion have been drawn up. and it
is in good financial shape.

t After being a co—ordinator of the co-op for
seventeen months. I've learned many skills.
One of these is the ability to manage a service
organization. After being involved in student
government for two years I've learned that
above all. SA needs a competent manager.
This is why I am running for SA President.

Some candidates hang lots of posters. make
speeches. paint bedtiheets,. and buy ASP

. personals to plead for your vote. Countless

pillars. doors. walls. and bulletin boards are
plastered with posters.

Most candidates fail to mention what they'll
do ifclected until ufterthe voting. Then it‘s too
late. You should know how I stand on the
issues before the election.

The administration‘s imposition of
distribution requirements will sharply limit
students‘ freedom to choose their own courses.
Presently. advisors don‘t advise; they sign
forms. They haven‘t the time to handle their
huge cascloads. Trained teachers aren't
necessarily competent advisors. If they can‘t
advise you now. how can they choose for you

Shrinking bus schedules and “(trim

expected, and was to receive less retirement
beneﬁts.

This decision by the administration was
inhumane. -A person should not be ﬁred at the
age of sixty-two. I‘m sure the administration
could have made arrangements for John to
remain as part of the faculty until he wished to
retire. It seems John was depressed enough by
this action to take his own life.

John's death was a needless one. We will
miss him very much.

sasu doesn’t
work?

To the Edltor:

it is unfortunate that SA President Steve
DiMeo is of the opinion that SASU, the
Student Association of the State University.
doesn‘t work to the advantage of students. He
is apparently ignorant of SASU's work and
accomplishments.

l have participated in several SASU

projects including absentee voter registration.
letter writing campaigns. and lobbyingefforts.
l have also attended several SASU
conferences. I am quite aware that SASU has
it number of faults. However. I have come to
recognize that people within SASU are also
aware of its faults and are slowly working to
correct them. Considering the fact that SASU
is a rather young organization. and that it
works with limited monetary and human
resources. the faults are quite tolerable in
comparison to the organization‘s
achievements.

SASU's lobbying efforts have successfully
promoted students‘ interests in four major
areas: ﬁghting restrictions on the use of
student activity fees or tax. fighting excessive
cuts in student ﬁnancial aid programs and in
the SUNY budget. fighting for student
representation in areas that affect students.
and advancing legislation to ease absentee
voter registration and balloting. Thanks to
SASU. there is now a student on the SUNY
Board of Trustees. students can vote absentee
Ilt primaries. and students can have an easier
time in absentee voter registration. What
SASU still hopes to accomplish is the
possibility of student representation oti the
Higher Education Assistance Corporation.
group handling of student loans and TAI’. and
legislation that will make it easier for students
to apply for absentee ballots. SASU‘s presence
as a lobbying group is promoting student
interests in many areas of legislation.

In light of SASU‘s lobbying
accomplishments. it is unreasonable to
condemn the organization because one of its
secondary tactics. the March l5
demonstration. wasn‘t a stunning success. It is
unreasonable to say that SASU doesn‘t work
to the advantage of students. To say that
SASU is not effective in promoting the
interests of students is to be ignorant of what
students can do. and are doing for themselves.

To the Editor:

For Year-9.1M: Wondered why this campus is
ht) male dominated. Most school
administrators are male. as are the majority of
student leaders.

The ASI’ masthead lists thirty-six female
staff members. The Editor'iti—Chiel'. the
Managing Editor. the Business Manager. the.
I’roduetion Manager. the Editorial l’uges
Editor. and all three News liditors are male.
There is only one woman in any decision
making capacity. She is an Associate liditor of

members are typists. The ASPs situation in
not unique.

Women are not properly represented in our
student government. They comprise more
than half of SUNYA‘s student population.
and pay over a quarter million dollars
annually towards the mandatory tax. There
are only ﬁve female representatives out of
thirty-two Central Council members.

The SA President. Vice President. and
Comptroller are male. as are the Assistant
Comptrollers and the Services Director.
Naturally. SA employs several secretaries and
stenographers who are female.

Yesterday. I noticed posters for two groups
of candidates for SA offices. Both tickets are
led by men. The females on both tickets are
Vice-Presidential candidates. In both cases.
these women have more experience in student
government titan their male runningmates.
Both women are content to run for the second
spot. whether oitt of fear of success. fear of
lailurc. or lack of sufficient selllconfidence. Is
it that these women couldn‘t get elected
President. or that they've been told they
couldn‘t so tiilL'li. they have internalized that
'j/at-i"?

I know you‘re thinkingthcre‘s nothingto do

catastrophic
calendar -

To the Editor:

On March 24. I went to my mail box and
found I was one of 400 lucky students whose
opinion was being solicited (along with 300
faculty members. deans. directors. and depart-
ment chairmen) concerning revisions in the
academic calendar. Since most students are
not aware ofwhat is being planned. I thought i
would inform you ofthe proposals for Spring
I978.

The overall objective (as stated in the sur-
vey) is to “. . . reflect a shift toward a non-
sectarian calendar which is based on legal.
economic. and educational considerations".
Here are two of the proposals:

Lengthening winter intersection a
eliminating one ol‘tlit' Into wee/rt “'0 have off
in the spring. and substituting a niirl-tllarr'h
vat‘alionjor Spring vocation.

l am not a religious fanatic. but I do con-
sider the Easter holidays to be important. Ac-
cording to the calendar. I am expected to be in
school for Maundy Thursday. cannot leave
until noon on Good Friday. and must once
again return to school on Easter Sunday. I do

not see any provision made for Passover
observanccs either, Fuel savings are cited. but
I fail to see how weeks off in January and
March save significantly over weeks in
February and April.

DNA: Forums . . .

To deny that there are no social issues involved in recombinant DNA ~
research is incredibly self-serving and narrow minded. The proposed
DNA research at SUNYA should take place, as long as certain stan-
dards are observed with regard to physical containment and intellectual
freedom. ‘
By rejecting NYPlRG‘s offer to co-sponsor an open forum on the sub-
ject. the Council on Research will only further present confusion on the
issue, and widen the gap between scientific and moral arguments.

If the Council feels that it is not their place to discuss anything other
than the strict scientific implications of the research, fine, But it is most“
certainly the university's duty to promote and/ or sponsor more exten-
sive discussion, and the Council’s duty to help inany way possible.
NYPlRG’s forum won‘t accomplish much without rational discus-
sion of both sides of the issue either. lfthis matter is to be cleared up to
any extent at all, the last thing needed is fanatical opinion from the far
side of the controversy.

. . . And Fo'rmica

The Biohazards Committee is moving ahead on an issue that is far
from settled, in hopes that once it is begun, it will be nearly impossible to
sto . ‘
[Eistead of waiting for the completion of a planned high containment
P2+ facility, the committee has agreed to allow lower level research to
begin. By doing so, the committee is committing two mistakes.
The. first is beginning research before the issue has been properly air-
ed. The second is building a facility that by its very nature invites careless
mistakes and human error. g
ls Biology room 310 a look at the future? The room‘ will have formica
table tops and a storage refrigerator. It will have unbreakable containers
to transport contaminated materials and a sign will be posted
prohibiting eating and smoking. BIO 3l0 will then be a PI facility.
The NIH guidelines for minimum Pl facilities were written to allow
experimentation at that level in the absence of the more expensive
precautions of a P2 facility.
But to begin dividing up areas of recombinant DNA research would
be counterproductive as well as dangerous; and to allow research to
begin in a Pl facility when a bigger, better and safer P2 facility ts on the

way is simply foolish.
