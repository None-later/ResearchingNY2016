, The New Hungarian Quartet

Sunday at 3:00 pm.
April l7, I977
Page Hall

 

By STEPHEN ALMASI

There was nothing to fault the
performance Sunday afternoon of the
New Hungarian Quartet at Page Hall.
The three-quarters capacity audience was
out of sympathy, however. with one piece
on the program. Few students were in
attendance. despite campus publicity
efforts; those present were older, more
conservative listeners, disconcerted by
the modernism of Bela Bartok.

The concert opened quietly enough.
Haydn‘s C Major Quartet Opus 33 No.3
charmed the audience. responding to the
players‘ beautiful handling of this light-
textured piece. The second movement,
“Allegretto”. went too slowly. however.
providing little contrast to the Adagio.
Folk-like melodic elements in the
vigorous Presto finale brought the work
to a sprightly conclusion.

Clearly. the audience was unprepared
for Bartok‘s fourth quartet. lf Haydn left
us unaware of any crisis. Biirtok‘s music

Shock turned to snickers. its members of

conclusion a triumphant performance of

Bartok‘s writing bristles throughout
