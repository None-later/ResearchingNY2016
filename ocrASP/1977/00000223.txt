This pail. weekend, the Albany
State Rugby Club picked up a pair of
victories. defeating Albany Med 22- .
3 and topping Sicna 24-13.

On Saturday, the ruggch took on
Albany Med. and State opened up a
quick 4-0 lead as Dom Rancone
rambled 35 yards to the Siena live
yard line. A loose ruck formed. and

Andy Lee picked up the try. A few
minutes later. Charlie Levine faked
out four Sicna defenders in a spec-
tactilar forty-yard run as the taggers

increased their lead to 8-0. Chuck '

Rappazzo added the conversion
points for a IO-O State lead at the

closest adversary by 22’4". Albany
junior Lou Robin came in third in
the hammer with a hurl of 97'. and
also placed fourth in the shot. which
was won by Bill l’etito of Brockport.
The most rewarding moment of
the day for the Danes came In the 440
intermediate hurdles. Freshman
Don Dross and soph Steve Williams
took first and second respectively.
with times ol 58.2 anti Shh respec-
tively. Dross not only did thejoh on

the truck. but came in second in the
long jump and fourth in the triple

jump as well. Munsey commented

on his li'eshman sensation. “He has
alot ol ability. but works as though
he has no ability. He‘s a helluva com-
pelitor."

lliis meet marked the first time
that an Albany track team suffered a
third-place limsh in a quadrangular
meet. Albany‘s \ctt'run coach has no

the B game. State was shut out by a
I4-0 score.

On Sunday. the ruggch took on
Siena. and State again opened up the
scoring olfa live yard scrum run by
Rappuzzo. Rapparzo added the con-
version points for a 6-0 Albany lead.
