‘Bare-Boncd 'Budget’ Pmposed

by Bryan Holzberg
SA President Steve DiMeo‘s Ex-

ecutive Budget for l977-l978 cut \

SI l.000 from the S4Il.779.50
recommendation made. by Budget
Committee. it does not include fun-
ding for SASU. Friends of Pierce
Hall Day Care Center, Protect Your
Environment. and five other groups.

At least to other groups were
recommended for cutbacks above
cuts made by Budget Committee.

It‘s ii hare-bone budget." said
DiMeo. “There's not much else that
could be cut off without raising the
student tax [from its present $66 per
school year.]"

Central Council is scheduled to
consider DiMeo‘s $400,758
recommendation Sunday at l:30
p.m. Chairman Greg Lessne said
budget discussion will be tabled until
Wednesday if a quorum is not reach-
ed. if there is still no quorum on

Wednesday night —— a distinct
possibility — DiMeo will approve
the budget as it stands.

“We canjust get by without a new
tax." said Lessne. "We've been
spreading ourselves too thin and we
haven‘t been terriﬁc planners.”
Lessne and DiMeo cut the ad-
ditional budget funds Monday after
receiving final Budget Committee
recommendations.

“Money is still there to give it back
to groups or SASU if Council
wants.“ DiMeo said. “l'm not happy
with SASU” he gave as reason for
cutting over $9500 in funds for the
student lobbying organization.

“Our input does not equal their
output. There's a new breed of stu-
dent with new concerns and goals
that SASU does not answer.“ he
said. DiMeosaid he felt other groups
could handle many of SASU‘s ac-
tivities. such as voter registration

Students Seek Permanent Role In Senate

by Matthew Cox

A proposal to give students a per-
miincnt place on the University
Senate. where they currently hold 23
of 90 seats. was passed by the Senate
April ll and is due to be decided
upon at a General Faculty Meeting
this September. Student Senate
members generated the proposal “so
that we won‘t have problems over
whether students are on the Senate
or off it.“ Sillti one student Senator.

Under the present Faculty By-
Laws. which govern Senate
proceedings. student representation
on the Senate must be rcneWed every
two years at general meeting of the
university faculty. he said.

Senator Malcolm Sherman
of the Mathematics Dept. said he
opposes the continuous representa-
tion proposal.

“The dominant group (in the

Senate) should be faculty and
professional staff. who are
colleagues and share it concern in the
university." he said. “Students in the
Senate . . . deny the faculty and
effective forum." he said.

Student Association President
Steve DiMeo said “Whatever
happens on this campus affects
students. and students linvea right to
a voice in the decision making on ilii
university matters.“ he said.

“ltshouid be acknowledged that
students are it part of the university
governitnce structure," he said.

DiMeo said he supports the con-
tinuous representation proposal
because. should students somedin
lose their seats on the Senate. “there
would be no student input at all."

The University Senate is
“technically an advisory body to Un-
iversity President Emmett Fields,

drives and student lobbying.

“We can‘t support our current
level of education." DiMeo .con-
tinued. “We're overextended and
should retrench where we're weak.”

DiMeo said until a few days ago,
he had been prepared to recommend
a two dollar tax increase to cover ad-
ditional athletic expenses. Presently
Sl4.50 of each student‘s tax goes
toward intercollegiate athletics.

However. not expecting that
proposal to pass Council. DiMeo
said he budgeted 5149.000 for inter-
collegiate athletics. This includes
323.000 taken from a Sl20.000
athletic surplus that has been built
up over the last few years.

Stabilizing Factor

“The surplus should be used as a
stabilizing factor within the $l4.50
tax appropriation.“said DiMeo. He
said the athletic budget proposal for
next year equals a similar budget of
two years ago and that “7.000 will
be cut from last year‘s appropria-
tion.

‘ Matty groups were cut for next
year since “they piss away too much
money in beer,“ according to Lessne.

Pierce Hall Day Care was cut.
Lessne said. because it is “not a
direct student activity. I‘m not
questioning its value. l‘m question-
i'ngthe propriety of SA funding it. It
would.be foolish to say those kids in

draw a great distinction between
funding them and funding a service
like Five-Quad Ambulance Service.“
Five-Quad received a proposed in-
crease in funding from mm to
310.200.

Lessne said one distinction he
drew between the similarly funded
groups was that the ambulance corps
is staffed by volunteers and Pierce
Hall has some paid staff members.

Dwellings Purchase A

by Jonathan Hodges

The Student Dwellings Corpora-
tion has come one step closer to
becoming a landlord by placing a
down payment on a building near
the corner of Dove and Hudson
avenues.

The building. zit 3l4-3lo Hudson.
would house between H iind l2
students in eight sepiiriitc
apartments. The final purchase of
the building is contingent tipoii the
success of various funding
procedures needed to supplement
the $20,000 appropriated ettrlier this
year by Central Council.

The rehabilitation grant. which is
administered by the Urban Renewal
Agency. would pay for one third of
the total Student Dwelling‘s
rehabilitation cost with federal

Senate Secretary Judy Kane said. It
is “the primary governance body on
this campus." she said. Students
have been represented on the Senate
since I969. she said.

The University Senate was
originally called the Faculty Senate.
and prior to I969 was composed
solely of teaching and non-teaching
faculty members. Kane said.
Membership was broadened "to get
student input." she said.

Sherman said he feels the presence
of students on the Senate “is one of
those things that's an excess of the
l960‘s . . . and is hardtogctrid of."

"I think it would be useful to have
students there in an ex-officio
capacity." he said.

"If there was a rule that students
couldn't meet except in the presence
of faculty. you'd understand how
some of us feel," he said.

funds. Student Dwellings President
Michael Urill estimates that the
rehabilitation on the building will
cost between five and IS thousand
dollars.

“Right now we're using a middle
man in applying to the Urban
Renewal Agency." said Grill. “We
are going through the Capitol Hill
improvement Corporation. CHIC is
a group created by the city to help
neighborhoods with rehabilitation
programs.“

If. with CHlC‘s help. the corpora-
lioii succeeds in obtaining the grant.
Student Dwellings would then ap-
proach banks for approval of a
mortgage and a rehabilitation loan.
because the federal government only
provides its third of the money after
the work is ﬁnished.

Senate member Philip Tompkins
of the Rhetoric and Com-
munications Dept. disagreed with
Sherman and said students in the
Senate “have helped to keep us from
passing stupid legislation by raising
helpful objections.”

As a member of a SUNY-wide
Faculty Senate. Tompkins said. “i
don't see any difference in the quality
of debate" between other campus
Senates where students don‘t serve
and between the Albany Senate.

“The same mundane issues are dis-
cussed." he said.

DiMeo said other bodies open to
students. like Central Council.
“don't fit into“ the University gover-
nance structure. “if the Senate does
something. let's face it. it has more
credence in the eyes of the ad-
ministration" than any othercampus
body. he said.

had gone along with their cutbacks
or termination. Protests were receiv-
ed yesterday from SASU. Accoun-
ting Society, Association for Com-
puting Machinery and SA
Operating. Some Council members
registered protests on cutbacks at all
living areit funding and Outing Club
funding. Lessne said he was
protesting DiMco‘s proposed fun-
ding for Students for Improvement
of Programs for the Handicappui
and the Accounting Society.

Step Closer

According to Grill, the corpora-
tion seeks a $28,000 mortgage leav-
ingthcm about$l3.000lcft for possi-
ble seed money to purchase ad-
ditional buildings. Rent money is ex-
pected to provide the funds needed
to meet the mortgage installments.

The bulk of the rehabilitation
funds would go to pay fora sprinkler
system for the front rooms ofthc sc-
cond floor. as well as the addition of
windows in several ofthe bedrooms.
in order to receive federal funds, the
entire rehabilitation program will
have to be completed four months
after the corporation obtains
ownership.

The Hudson Avenue building was
selected after the corporation ex-
amined a number of apartments for
sale in the area.

“We selected 3l4-316 Hudson not
only because it was a good building
in itself. but because of what is
