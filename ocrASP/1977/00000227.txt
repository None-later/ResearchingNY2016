HingerAwareness

by Ed Griffin

Over 300 students are going
hungry today and most ol‘tomorrow
to show their concern for the plight
of the one-third of humankind for
whom hunger is a daily reality.

The fast. sponsored by the student
group. People and Food. has two
purposesvritising hunger con-
sciousness on campus. ttnd raising
funds to aid those who hunger. l‘ar-
ticipitnts are sponsored per hour of
abstinence. and the funds are to be
distributed through CROP. the
community hunger appeal of
Church World Service. to hunger
fighting agencies in developing
countries and here in Albany.

During the last twenty four hours
of the fast the groupwili conduct it
hunger awareness marathon in the
U-Loungc and penthouse on
Colonial Quad. The session. begin-
ning at 6 this evening. will include
speakers. films. discussions and
awareness games. all aimed at sen-
sitizing students to their role in the
hunger problem and what they can
do to help.

According to Elizabeth Nolan.
who is arranging the 24 hour
program. the hope of the event is "to
share with the l'asters an understan-
ding ofthe complexity of the hunger
issue. as we experience the simple
side of'the problem. the feelingin our
stomach when we don't eat. Our goal
is to leave concerned people with
concrete ideas as well as difficult
questions about the solutions to
hunger. We want them to feel for
those who starve daily and can not
choose when they will ever eat
again.“

People and Food began last
month when several students taking
the World Food Crisis course decid-
ed to do something constructive
about the problem. After the initial
meetings. the fast idea evolved and
recruitment and planning began.
The recruitment workers. led by
Mary Rand and Michael (iuiliano.
have been encouraged by student
response. Lynn Friedell. publicity
chairperson for the group. spoke of
several students expressing their

gratitude for the chance to help the
hungry. and added. "We really
touched them."

The hunger awareness marathon
is open to the unchrsitycommunity.
it Will be held from 6 pm. tonight to
6 pm. tomorrow.

new test will use various kinds of

questions.

“Three types will be used in the
analytical section: analysis of ex-
planations. logical diagrams. and
analytical reasoning questions. each
designed to test a different aspect of
analytical ability." she said.

Somerville also explained that no
formal training in logic or methods
of" analysis is required to do well on
the new measure.

“Same analytical skills are re-
quired and developed in virtually all
fields of study.“ g she explained.
“And. like verbal and quantitative
skills. analytical skills are developed
over a long period of time and are
not believed to be improved to any
significant degree by intensive study
in a brief period of time.“

Somerville also noted that the
1977-78 GRE Bulletin of informa-
tion will describe the new measure
and will include sample questions
and explanations of the answers.
The Bulletin is sent free to all
students registering for the GRE.

In addition. a Sample Aptitude
Test containing the same number
and types of questions as the actual
exam can be ordered at one dollar
per copy. Both pubiicatons will be
available on August I.

Despite the new addition, the
GRE will remain a three-hour test
since the verbal and quantitative
portions have been shortened and
the time saved allocated to the new
measure.

“The some research effort that
produced the new measure also
yielded shorter versions of the verbal
and quantitative sections that are

stipullation that any proposal sub-
mitted would provide a comparable
opportunity for all student groups
representing diverse points of view
within the University.

Trustees re-cmphtisired that one of
the original purposes of the Student
Assembly is to provide “a forum for
student opinions" at cttch Assembly
meeting. The Trustees“ resolution
directed that the opinions expressed
at these meetings “be regularly
trasmitted to the Chancellor or his
dcsignec."

The restructuring action makes it
possible for the Assembly to expand
membership to lot). if the Assembly
itscll' decides the additional
representation is warranted and that
the student groups desiring represen-
tation meet certain criteria.
