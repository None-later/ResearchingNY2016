WHAT’S A TZOTZIL?

Wisconsin Senator William Prox-
mire has given his “golden'tieece of
the month“ award for April to the
Smithsonian Institution for spen-
ding taxpayers' money to produce an
obscure dictionary. Proxmire says
that the Smithsonian spent 589.000
to research and write a dictionary in
the “Tzotzii” language, an unwritten
Mayan dialect spoken by only about

1/1

‘9 sﬂimnsi
ltl.t)00 persons in southern Mexico.
l’roxmirc adds that: “To topthis off.
there are no Spanish definitions in
the dictionary and thus. as
acknowledged in the volumc's in-
troduction. it is essentially useless to
even this tiny band of peasants.“

ZEN/AG ~

The senator further berates the
dictionary by quoting from its in-
troduction in which the author con-
fesses he gnthcred‘the information
“both sober and‘drunk." The in-
troduction also warns that members
at the Zinacnntec tribe.-l’or whom
the book was written. 'maycnd up us-
ing the pages for toilet tissue..Says
Proxmir‘e: f‘l don‘t know how to say

’ ‘we've been had' in Tzotzil. butthat

about sums up my feelings."

UFoLoGYSEMINAR

An “International Ufoiogy Con-

ference,“ described by sponsors as"

the largest international meeting on
unidentified ﬂying objects ever held.
has been staged for this week in
Acapulco, Mexico. Among those
attending the week-long series of
meetings are American UFO expert
.I. Allen Hynek; French specialist
Jacques Valle: Cornell Astronomer
and cxo-biologist Doctor Carl
Sagan; lormer air t'orcc Major
Donald Kcyhoe; and U.S. astronaut
Gordon Cooper.

Researchers from 30 V nations:
around the world, including ofﬁcial

representatives from several
governments. will be in attendance.

Sponsors of the “Ufology event" re- '

port it will be staged like a “mini un-

ited nations‘ﬂ —' featuring daily

meetings. Each of the speeches will
immediately be translated. into ﬁve
languages - — English. French,
Spanish. Portuguese and German.
The purpose olf the worldwide con-

ference. they say. is to urge”
governments to adopt what they call”

“an international strategy on the
UFO problem".

CON(NING) ED

As energy costs continue to
skyrocket. tln increasing number of
individuals and companies across
America are reportedly literally
“stealing electricity.“ The Wall
Slrr’l’l Jaimie/says that hundreds of
thousands at utility users ‘ from
small homeowners to large business
operators —- hiivc learned the "ins"
and "outs" of tinkering with or even

by-passing their‘electric meters to:
keep" their readings lower. The'>

newspaper states that tens of
millions of dollars in electric pov'rer
is apparently being stolen without
detection. ' .

To combat the problem, utility
companies across the U. S. are taking
sterner steps to crack down on power
burglaries: Consolidated Edison in
New York.t‘orexample, now has l80

investigators equipped with

ﬂashlights and two-way radios who
do nothing but prowl across thecity,
looking for suspicious wires by-
passing their meters.

ln addition. Con Ed pays its
employees a “bounty” of SW to SIS
for each electricity robber who is
turned in. Last year. according to
The Journal. Con Ed paid a whop-
pingSl 10.000 in bounties alone. Con
Ed reports it uncowrcd l2.000 cases
of theft last year. and recovered $6
million in revenue . . . but the
amount discovered is considered the
tip ot. the iceberg ot~ what‘s actually
being stolen.

with members of theme
News Service says that‘McDo V

‘ the nation‘s largest fast-f

and the maker of the “big in. _
apparently” become one or the
targets _of organized crime leaders.
According to Knight News, ex-
ecutives at the golden arches as well

as justice department organized
crime experts fear that McDonald's
outlets might be ideal for mobsters
who are looking for new ways to
launder “tainted money.“ and to ex-
pand into other businesses linked to
organized crime.

The McDonald‘s chain has
already gone to federal court in el-
l‘orts to regain control of about 30
McDonald‘s restaurants that are
partially controlled by two business
operators with reputed Malia ties.
The two investors reportedly have
been making millions of dollars off
of their "secret" interests in Mc-
Donald's eateries. and investing
some of their profits in a Las Vegas
gambling casino.

The folks at McDonald‘s are ud-
mittcdly worried about Ronald Mc-
Donald being linked to the mob.
Says one golden arches official: "We
want to keep McDonald‘s free of any
unsavory elements. We want to be its
clean and as all-American as ham—
burgers . . 

TOLL-FREE

Vietnam war veterans who receiv-
ed less-thzm-honorablc discharges
are swamping government
switclthonrds with more than 3000
telephone calls a day. The calls are
pouring into the government‘s joint
liaison office in Overland Missouri.
in response to President Carter's
proposal to reevaluate and up-gradc
military discharges. To handle the
avalanche ol'calls. cxtru personnel to
answer 50 telephones for 13 hours
each day have been hired. and placed
in cubicles in the basement ol’ the
ttvo-hlock~long records building in
Overland. However. they report they
are still unable to keep tip with the
thousands of toll-tree calls that are
pouring in.

AGE OF BOREDOM

’l'wo lllinois researchers are wur-
ning that the human race is about to
enter what they term a crisis of
boredom. Psychologist Salvatore
Maddi ot‘the University of Chicago
and engineering Professor Andre
Vacrous ot' the Illinois institute of
Technology predict that the result of
the computer age will be an upswing
in alcoholism. drugabuse and crime.
The reason for this. they say. is that
machines will take over many of our
daily tasks. leaving us with little to
do. The two researchers say that
today's self-timing micro-wave
ovens and other similar labor-savers
are only the beginning: They state
that within the next l5 years or 50.
millions of people will feel they are
no longer productive because many
of their responsibilities will be
replaced. The probable result. say
Mnddi and Vacrous. will be more
boredom and more drinking.
