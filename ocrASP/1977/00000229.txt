but . . .

To the Editor:
After a series of unhappy surprises in my

A personal life I've withdrawn from the Student

Association presidential race.

To all the people who listened toand believ-
ed in me, my.deepest apologies.

My withdrawal in no way affects my vice
presidential running mate. Jim Aronoff. i
hope those of you who supported both of us
do not let my actions interfere with your com-
mitment to Jim.

vote for "me
as veep

To the Editor:

With elections around the corner. I would
like to express my qualiﬁcations and
aspirations as a candidate for Vice President
of the Student Association. The SA Vice
President has ﬂexibility which allows him or
her to communicate with students. Central
Council and SA groups. This communication
is necessary for an effective Student
Association. and is desperately needed now.
My experience as an off campus
representative. and chairperson of the
Administration and Auxiliary Services
Committee is important in fulﬁlling this need.
My participation in projects and committees
such as UAS. last year's bus rally.SASU‘s fight
against budget cuts. the CDTA bus
committee. the NYPlRG-SASU Registration
Drive. and the Used Book Exchange. has
made me aware of students‘ needs at this
university.

The Vice President is responsible for
providing a student voice in the development
of university policies. There are many issues
which relate directly to students. yet do not
appear on SA's agenda.

The transformation of Mohawk Tower to a
dormitory has provided our university with a
greater space problem than we once had. It is
SA‘s responsibility to see that we do not get

L

pushed into a small corner. The Campus 9 '

Center should .be operated by students.
converting it into a student union. Downtown
and off campus students should be able to
utilize the .gym facilities and classrooms
located in the Draper complex. The Patroon
Room should be a student oriented food
service such as a delicatessen. instead of the
dining hall designed and utilized by
administrators. '

Academic policy decisions are usually made
with little or no student imput. Student
representation on the Senate depends on a
faculty vote each year. We cannot afford to
continue this unstable representation
concerning matters such as distribution
requirements and plus/minus grading. SA
must speak out on decisions which have a
large impact on students. before they reach the
desks of the administrators.

Most important. SA must reach out to the
students they represent. These students are
having their money appropriated. and these
students pay the stipends of the SA President
and Vice President. Through open forums. the

campus media. and personal contact. the _

political arm of SA will reach out to you.
We need a Student Association Vice
President who will do more than sign
vouchers. manage the contact office. and give
out - solicitation permits. As your Vice
President I will do more.

they say
they will . . .

To the Editor:

They say they‘ll increase student awareness.
student involvement and communication
between SA and students. They say they'll
organize students and ﬁght administrators.
They say they‘ll initiate new. innovative
programs for the benefit of all students. They
say they‘ll be dedicated and responsible
student leaders. They say they'll make
changes.

Before they tell what they're going to do. ask
them what they‘ve done. When they tell you
they'll change things, demand speciﬁc
proposals.

I'll stand on my record and my proposals.

To the Editor:

During the next week. you will see a lot of
posters and hear a lot of speeches on the
virtues of each presidential candidate. I can
see that there are many candidates. each
highly qualified in his own right. and it will be
hard to make a choice. However, you should
make a choice. SA needs your support. Your
vote will count in making SA stronger. l am
hoping that you will vote for me. I would like
your vote. but SA needs your vote. Regard-
less of who you choose. please vote.

Mitch Werner
Candidate for SA President

unusualand
unconvenﬂal

To the Editor:

i am running for SA President. but my
name wasn't strewn over the pillars until
yesterday. lam running for SA President. but
I'm not treating people like babiesand begging
for votes. My name is Jon Lafayette and l‘m
notjust another asshole running for President.

In October. I resigned from both Central
Council and Class of 78 Council. I was sick of
what we had to do to get things done. I was
sick of seeing SA not accomplish anything,
and working hard to do nothing. Greatefforts
and care were wasted. l promised myself l
wouldn‘t be involved with SA if I had toput up
with that kind of shit again.

Under another President. SA will continue
to function under its own structures.
committees and rules. It needs something new.
It needs something different. it needs
something unconventional. I feel lcan deliver
changes. No structure is sacred to me. and I
won‘t hesitate to change things so that people
can work and things can get done.

i won‘t be afraid to use all ofthe resources at
our disposal to improve life here. I won’t be
afraid to come to the students with problems.
to explain what‘s happening. or to hear what
you have to say. I will be visible partying.

' podiating. and being friendly. i will use the

ASP and WSUA to get to the students. Next
year, you will be able to name at least three
good things SA has done and you will
recognize the SA president if you trip over him
at Bogart‘s or Sutter's.

. I‘m not running a normal campaign (please
come to my rallies on the quads) but if an
unusual campaign works, an unconventional
President may be just what we need.
