commuter from page 3a ‘
Spence and Steve unloaded their cargo at the
fireplace and set out for the cabin to attempt repairs on
the lantern. It was the only one they had.

Seated at a small wooden table near the stove, they
took turns fiddling with the valves and the air pump on
the lantern. The flow of Coleman ﬂuid. the camper's
version of napalm. from the reservoir was blocked off.
After a few minutes. they managed to unclog the fuel
line. But in the process they also managed to crumble
the iishcn mantle around which the flame burned. So
there would be no light from the lantern that night. The
light from the fire outside and from the meager remains
of a dis 'ardcd candle would have to suffice.

News of the defunct Coleman lantern was not well-

    
    

 
 
 
   
  

        
        
     
    
 

rcccivcd by Eric. “llright boys." he muttered sleepily.
luckily. they had finished dinner earlier. The four of
them devoured a large pot of chili prepared by Betty
and [Eric ('ooking in the dark would have been
difficult.

Spence and Steve went back outside leaving Betty
and liric iii the cabin with the slowly disappearing
candle. Andtheyfedthe fire. ltate allthey could give it,
and still it was not quenched. And so they burned more
bark and by its light. split the logs into halves. then
quarters. with the iron wedge and sledge hammer. 'l'hc
quarters were sliced down to burning si/e with single
swings ol the as.

They served the fire well. and itservcd them. Every
time another piece of bark flared up they laughed
wildly. As the flames oftlic bonfire danced around the
top of the stone and concrete chimney their eyes bulged
with excitement.

Their facial expressions would have more readily
belil two child molesters set free to roam about a
Brownie camp. And like those who lust for innocent
young girls. they served the fire not because their
hraiiis were particularly small. nor because iin unstable
emironmciit had transformed their cortical cells into
yogurt. lhey did it because they enjoyed it.

Spencer and Steve eventually tired and left the blast
furnace they had created. Though they knew their
departure meant certain death for the bonlirc. their
chilled bodies longed for the warmth ol’the cabin and a
cup of hot chocolate.

 

  
   

The tour of them sat around the dark room sipping
the cocoa and telling tales of psychopaths who escaped
from institutions and made their homes in the woods.
The storicsalways ended with innocent campers falling
prey to the random violence of these "crazy"
individuals. Often the victims were hacked to death
with their own ax which had been carelessly leaned
against a tree.

'I he only dcccitt light in the room came from the
wood simc. and oiin from there when one ofthc iron
plates was removed from the top allowing flames tojut
out. Unfortunately. with the llames came smoke, so
they stayed in the dark as much as possible.

Ihcy were thinking about going to bed when Eric
announced the arrival of a visitor. “I don‘t know if]
should say this. but a rat just came in through the
\\ indon 

I'l'lt.’ yanked ii cover olfof the stove while Spent: ' and
Stetc grabbed the as and the sledge hammer. They
searched lor the intruding rat. but the lack of good.
clean light foiled their efforts. Smoke from the open
stote probably would have choked them to death
below the rat was lotind. r. ‘

Finally, they all settled down for some sleep. Betty
and lzi'ic took the lower bunk near the stove. Spcnee
and Steve were left with the beds on the opposite wall.

Before climbing tip to iind nearly falling down through
the upper bunk. Steve slid the ax and the sledge
hammer underneath the bed otit ofsight. Light from
the gr ‘atly subdued bonfire outside still llickercd on
the cabin walls-Silence fell upon the room quickly and
they slept. or at least tried to. Somewhere. the rat was
still wandering around. The two woodsmcn zipped
their sleeping bags up tight.

It was cold in the morning.

Outside the snow adjacent to the cabin and
surrounding the fireplace was stained with black ash.
'l'he l'liifly powder had been beaten down by lootstcps.
An icy finish gla/cd the siirlacc. Woodeliips and
sawdust werc sprinkled about. I he place was a mess.

“You guys. I don‘t know said Betty. shaking her
heiid troin side to side.

lhc loiii' ol them packed tip the Ielto\er loud and
gathered the gear together. It was time to lcate.

'l hey marched down the trail away lrom the cabin
and past the woodshcd. Spence and Steve ehattercd
about plans for the next trip. lircd.cold .iinlsore.thc_\'
\\t.‘l't.‘ glad to leave now. But they knew \vellthey wottld ’

return Stltll’l. i'

And once again \\ liitc hot coals \\ otild spit and.
Homes would rise high tearing into the black still ol an
Adirondack night.
