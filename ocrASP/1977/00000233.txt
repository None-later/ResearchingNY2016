Mamba-Men ~'_v v -,
A book‘ofpoerns'by Dori Byrd ' v ,
North Atlantic? Press; [26 pages: $4.00
By STEPHEN ALMASI

“Earth has always been without
meaning and always will b_e'.".'s'tates Don
Byrd in his book of poems. titled Aesop's
Garden. “That is not a mystery, it is a
fact." Around this forthright statement
there revolves a mesh of mysteries. each
examining the author's relationship to his
language and to the world he inhabits.

An associate English professor at
SUNYA. Mr. Byrd adds a special touch
of interest to his work by the use of local
imagery. contrasting the hilly Mohawk-
Hudson river valleys to the “High Plains"
of his native Midwest. His attitude
towards local geography grows crystal-
clear as we read: “more than once/you‘ve
wanted to kick in/the face of the
Hcldcrhcrgs/for no more reason/than to
see the sky/go on".

This sense of entrapment comes up
again and again in his poetry. The web.
whether physical or linguistic. is spawned
by a faith in false knowledge. Escape is
accomplished through the rediscovery of
innocence. the struggle to maintain clear
thinking inaconfused. self-absorbed age.

The six sections of Aesop's Garden
form a single narrative. combining a
hierarchy of metaphors in a variety of
dream-like encounters. The search for
those prclinguistic symbols which lie at
the roots of language reveals itself in the
simple acts of counting. of measuring
one's own steps as music. ofsccing oneself
reflected in. and even replaced by. one‘s
environment. Cities both real and
intangible appear ' as links to an
impersonal geography. Encyclopedias
lend false security to those who. in
seeking after knowledge. bypass

experience;

.. -_A-rmusical quality plays through his
patterns of thoughtoThe separate pieces
which make up this expansive self-poem
might be seen as symphonic movements.
with themes and counter-themes
combining in a sometimes abstract
fashion. His concluding phrases act as
codas in a classical sonata format.
bringing the issues of the poem to a peak
of tension.

Since each main section runs for many
pages and involves much interWeaving of
metaphors. it is impractical to excerpt
snatches of the work for quotation here.

The Classical Forum

  

I just baked a cake. a huge birthday
cake. covered with candles. To celebrate
what‘.’ Rome‘s birthday. of course. On
April 2|. 753 B.C.. according to Roman
calculations. Romulus saw the augury of
the twelve vultures. designating the
Palatine Hill as the site for the future city
of Rome. and on that very day founded
his city upon that hill. For an ordinary
birthday celebration the Romans did not
use our type of large birthday cake. but
they did have family Observances.
including offerings of small cakes and
unmixed wine to the Genius (“Spirit" or
perhaps “Guardian Angel“) of the one
whose birthday was being celebrated and
prayers for his good fortune.

The birthday of Rome. however. called
for no ordinary celebration. It coincided
(was it only chance?) with an old Italic
festival. the Parilia. held in honor of the
deity Pales. (A linguistic change has
substituted an r for an I.) Pales.
sometimes considered male. sometimes

  
 
  

 

 

 

There are kernels of humor side .by side
with tragedy. In his account ofthe fall of
Vietnam. Byrd compares the tension in
the air at the time to that aroused by the
St. Louis Cardinals‘ drive forapennant.

female. presided over
shepherds.

The Parilia. originally a country
festival. was brought into the city and
celebrated on the Palatine Hill. both
honoring the deity and commemorating
the foundation of Rome. The name
Palatine may be derived from Pales. the
name ofthe divine guardian ofthe flocks.
In the country the sheep and sheepfolds
were purified, as were the countryfolk
themselves. Cakes were presented to the
god. and prayers were offered.

The idea of Rome‘s birthday being on
April 2| was popular throughout much of
antiquity and was even revived by the late
Fiscist government Of Italy. But let us
observe the birthday of the Eternal City
with these lines from Milton‘s Paradise
Regainetl: ‘
