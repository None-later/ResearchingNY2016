Wings Over America
Wings
Capitol

 

By DAVID GOLDMAN

Wings Over America consists of the
entire repertoire performed by Paul
McCartney and Company on their
Americanto’ur last spring. It includes
McCartney‘s recent music as well as five
Beatle numbers and a few songs
previously unrecorded by Wings. There is
enough material here to please every
McCartney fan. and perhaps some non-
bclievers as well, since this album gives
proof that, on stage. Wings is not the
cloyingly cute ensemble some people have
accused them of being after hearingtheir
records. Anyone who felt this way is in for
a mild shock when they hear “.let“.
“Medicine Jar“. "Beware My Love" and
the other rockers who performed here.

Although releasing an entire concertas

an album seems generous of McCartney,
WOA could have been much tighter as a
two LP set. The entire fifth side, for
instance. consisting of four songs from the
most recent studio LP, “Wings At The
Speed of Sound", seems superﬂuous.
since the versions here aren‘t very
different from the originals. Also. Denny
Laine‘s rendition of Paul Simon's
“Richard Cory" is hardly up to the high
quality of the rest of the album, with
Lainc taking Simon's moving ballad and
treating it as ajoke. Most of McCartney‘s
comments to the audience have been cut.
for some reason. and the cover gives no
information about where and when the
songs were recorded. The album itself
doesn‘t even have the word "live"
anywhere on it. and there aren't very
many in-concert photos provided,either.

But this is of secondary importance to
the music itself. which is first-rate. Denny
Laine sings a superb version of "Go
Now“. his old Moody Blues hit. and
McCartney performs “Lady Madonna".
“Live and Let Die". “Hi Hi Hi“ and other
with style. Even the second encore. the
previously unreleased “Soily”, which
sounded like a bunch of noise when I
heard it in concert, comes off well here.
although why McCartney chose it as an
encore is beyond me. All in all. Wings
()l't‘l' Aliicricu provides much (maybe a
little too much) music for McCartney
fans and non-fans alike. and gives an
accurate aural presentation of Wings in
concert.

Just a story From America
Elliot Murphy
RCA

 

By PETER HOFFMAN

Elliott Murphy has had three albums
on two different labels but he has yet to
"break". Willi the release of his fourth
album. Just a Stu/1r From America. he
has been picked tip by a third label,
Columbia. It is sad that with such a
prestigious label he has produced such a
pretentious bore ol an album.

./u.\/ (I .S'Iuri' l-rum .-’llllt'l‘lt'tl uses the
same lormat as each at his previous
albums. but this tune it doesn't work.
Perhaps it is his new producer. Robiii
L'iiblc. It could be his new band. which
includes l’hil ('olhnsul (iencsis and Mick
llt)lt)l'. lurincrly ol the Rolling Stones.
Maybe it‘s the lacl that he recorded an
album III I urupc tor the Iirst time. ldon‘t
believe any of these are the reasons.
Murphy has decided to record a blatantly
commercial album. with a few singles and
not much else \\‘til‘lll\\’llllL‘.

“l )i Me All Night". the opening song on

i .,.v y- “u

reminiscent of Springsteen:  _, h
"Now full/("11W what it reek ltk on ‘a
hot Sundayntght '
When you just can‘t go home must
things aren't quite right >
So we sneak into your house; but it's
the Wrong one ‘
Cause they all look tiresome; this
Ioii'n's just no jun. '

But we ﬁnally get it right and i/ﬂi‘our‘
r/urlrlr knew he'd lti/l '

Aml we hit that ltlg/tlt'ql' about a
lium/rcrl and one '

And I hear this funny noise. man
Ilit(i"l'c Ii'_i'in' Io .r/mt'l ()tll‘_/llI1."

The title song has a reggae-like sound
with the use of steel drums. It doesn't
Work at all. In fact. the song sounds
distorted, as if it was recorded at a slower
speed.

"Rock Ballad" isthc onetrulyexcellcnt
song on the album. Mick 'l'aylor‘s fine
lead guitar playing is perfectly attuned to
Murphy's vocals. l'hc lyrics do not try to
he too intcllecttial for t he average listener:
"Non let's all raise our glass. for a drink
to the past. And a drink tothc last chance
taken. And let's drink once again to our
long lost lricnds. No. “C can‘t let it end
the surl‘s breaking."

It seems that with each of his albums
Murphy has lorsakcn new musical
arrangements and. instead. ie has
become more ol an Intellectual lyricist. Hy
doing this he is alienating the lans he
acquired at the beginning ol his career.
He is \ltlgllttllllg musically and he might
as “all release a hook at lyrics rathcrtlian
an album.
