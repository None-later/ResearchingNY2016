Thin books of good meals and

have we got
candidates?

To the Editor:

There is on SA election coming up.
Although we are not students who are usually
active in student government. we feel that this
time there are two candidates who especially
deserve our support. They are Paul Feldman
for President. and Kathy Baron for Vice
President.

We know Paul and Kathy personally. They
are reasonable. cooperative people who won‘t
get bogged down in petty political clashes
associated with student government. They are
also strong advocates of student interests.
Student government isn't anego trip for them.
but rather a chance to really effect change.

We respect Paul and Kathy for the hard
work they have done on behall'ofthe students.
We belicvcthcywilldoeven more for SUNYA
undergraduates as the President and Vice
President of SA.

‘Toihe Editor:

When I was two years old. I pretended my
hand was it piece of Wonder Bread and stuck it
in a toaster, Having learned at such an
Impressionablc age that heat and fire could be
dangerous. and with three scars on my left
ﬁngers as a handy reminder. one might
wonder why I chose to ignore a fire alarm last
semester. running the theoretical risk of
toastmg the whole loaf.

For lfis particular fire alarm. about the
tenth of the semester in Stuyvesant Tower. the
merry prankstcr chose my floor. My RA was
to eager to show that his gang was not
Involved that he scorched each room in the
suction. I was ferrctcd out, bundled off to
Dutch Quad Judicial Board. and given my
medicine. I was appointed Fire Marshall of
the section and was placed on probation for
the semester. In addition. I was asked to write
it letter, with “the intention of submitting it to
the Albany Student Press." outlining the
dangers ni‘hercnt with fire safety violations.
Here I go,

IFﬂiling to respond to it fire alarm is u
VIOIIttlon of New York State Fire Regulations.

way to win it popularity contest. And

  
 

ﬂ

who knows what responsibilities your RA:
may add on? As the Judicial Board chairman
wrote to me. “At any time the alarm could go
off and you are expected to carry out the
duties assigned to you.” '

You may not end up as a Fire Marshall—
because the Judicial Board tries to ﬁt the
punishment to the crime. As the chairman
wrote. “The Board in its decision drew upon
various aspects to this case alone. and its
decision was based only on those parts

 
      
   

   

introduced in this case.“
The Dutch Quad Judicial Board feels that

“its first objective is to be educative rather
than punitive." I must admit I am somewhat
confused bythatstatement. though it might be
very noble. If the Board meant its first
objective to be educative. does that imply that
its first objective was. in reality. something
else“) It‘s a mystery. and Isupposc that only the
pic-law students can interpret these things.

‘ Anyway. the advice from this penitent is
simple. Avoid hassles. go down for all fire
alurms, and be nice to all university officials
during alarms. Perhaps you won’t have to
endure reading any more letters like this in the
ASI‘. licttcr yet. you won't have to write one
either.

To the Editor:

Ms. Murphy raised some valid points in her
letter to the editor on April I9:‘Shc said that
tltcre are too few females involved in student
activities and used the ASP and Student
Association as examples. Since I am an active
participant in both of these organizations. I
noticed a great deal of wrong information in
Ms. Murphy‘s letter.

First. she failed to mention that one ofthe
advertising managers of the ASPis a woman.
This is an extremely important and time-
consumingjob. She is responsible for bringing
in the money that allows the ASP to be
independent of SA tax support.

Second. she discounts the positions that
most women hold at the ASP. since they do
not seem to be important on the whole. Most
ofthe production stall is female; this includes
production workers. typists. and ad
production workers. All of these people are
trained to use complex machinery. The reason
we choose to stay Ill our present positions is
because we are not willing to put in the
incredibly long hours that the editors mid
managers do.

In her discussion of SA. Ms. Murphy is
obviously talking through her hat. She
completely ignores the entire judicial branch
of SA. which is 28 percent fcmulc. She also
ignores the female SASU delegate. The SA
secretary is u wotnan simply because no
qualified men applied for the job.

Ms. Murphy is right when she says that
there Isn't enough participation by women in
student activities. When I became aware of
this. I Involved myself in two organitalons. I
challenge you. Ms. Murphy. to do more than
write letters to the editor. bitching about what
others aren‘t doing. .loin something! Run for
something! You JUSI have to be willing to do
what most women at SUNYA refuse to do 7
get out of the library and spend some time
working I really believe that the clubs and
groups on this campus need good people.
Don‘t just complain. Do something yourself.

.Central Council has done incredibly stupid things in the past, that:  7
Will continue to do incredibly stupid things in the future. That’s to be ex- '

pec‘ted. But when Council begins to fade away, when its members treat it
 just another line on their law school applications, that it's time totoke
some drastic action. ' '
. Disband Council. It would only be a formalization of an already ex-
isting situation, but it has to be done. Sub-committees presently do all
the necessary work anyway. A ten-member legislative group could ac-
complish more in one meeting than Greg Lessne’s oversized zoo has
done all year. _ I ‘
Council spends most of its time dealing with money—when it’s not too
busy impeaching someone, or issuing resolutions expressing its dis-
pleasure with the universe. The general rule: SA groups want more

money, and Council feels that they can do with much less. Those who

complain loudest and longest win.

'The cornerstone of this institutionalized chaos is the Executive
Budget. Each year, the outgoing President presents Council with a
budget. and each year Council twists and shouts it into its final, “accep-
table” form.

This year’s budget is an important one. It determines the fate of
SASU, cuts out several smaller groups entirely, and generally slashes all
around.

If Council fails to rustle up a quorum as it has failed to do for several
wee ks. SA President Steve DiMeo will cut SASU, take the l I grand sav-
ed there and spread it around the rest of SA.

The President acts in the absence of Council, and if Council continues
the way it’s been going lately, SA is well on the way to a one man rule. One
thing that can be said for a benevolent dictatorship: it’s efficient.
However, there's no guarantee of benevolence.

On a campus where the students have swallowed the edicts of Presi-
dent Fields without much more than a whimper, maybe this whole situa-
tion shouldn’t be surprising. In any case, the student body and their
elected representatives will most certainly get what they deserve.

 

QUOTE or THE DAY
"They piss away too much money in beer. "

Central Council Chairman Greg Lessnc. explaining this year‘s budget cuts.
