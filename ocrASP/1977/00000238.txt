I Pitching was the name ofthe game
* Tuesday. as the Great Dane 'junior
varsity baseball tcttm took to Un-
iversity Field for the first time this
season. Under the supervision of
coach Jtick Siedleeki, the Danes
picked up their first victory with a 9-
3 trouncing of Schenectady Com-
munity College. -

“Rich McGuire pitched a fine
game." said Siedleeki afterward.
Mctiuire came into the game in the
fifth inning. replacing starter Gary
LaConture. who had pitched himself
into a jam in that frame. The
LaConture-McUuirc combination
held Schenectady to only two hits
while striking out seventeen batters.

Schenectady Scoreless

After holding Schenectady
scoreless in the top half ofthe first in-
ning. the Danes went to work offen-
sively. Third baseman Bob Petosa
started things offwith a single down
the leftfield line. He moved to second
on a passed ball and scored when
Schenectady centerfield Pete
Nealm misjudged l.| ball offthe hat of
Albany‘s Buz Mulqueen. Mulqueen
went around to third base on the
play. but was caught trying to score
on a wild pitch by Schenectady‘s
Micky Durso.

But with two outs. Albany‘s Dave
Peck and Mike Rogalski hit back-to-
back singles. Peck moved tothird on

atwild pitch and scored on it passed
ball. ‘ ‘ ‘

Working with a 2-0 lead; Albany
hurler LaConture struck out the side
in the next two innings. But in the
fourth. Schenectady came back to tie
the game.

" L Bad Throw

A bad throw by shortstop Mul-
.queen allowed Mike DelBroeco to
.reach first. A pitch later. DelBrocco
stole second and then moved tothird
on a base hit by teammate Ken
Hahn. Hahn broke to second base.
and in an effort to cut him down, the
throw from Dane catcher. Bruce
Kulzer. got by Rich Levinson at the
bag. DelBroeco scored on the play
while Hahn moved to third. Hahn
later scored on a pitch inthe dirt that
couldn‘t be handled by Kulzer.

Schenectady tallied one more run
in the fifth inning as LaConture
walked two and threw a wild pitch
before yielding to McGuire.
McGuire gave up a single to bring in
the third run. but that was the last hit
Schenectady was to get for the rest of
the day.

With the Danes behind by one
run. the fireworks began as Albany
exploded for seven runs off Durson
in their half of the fifth to put the
game out of reach. After a walk to
Mulqueen and a single by Shaw.
l’eck hit a hard grounder to Schenec-
tady second baseman. John Howley.

cond allowing Mulqueen to score. A
wild pitch then scored Shaw before
Rogalski walked. A double by Matt
Croak knocked in two more runs.
and it was time for Durso to hit the
showers in favor of righthander
Bruce Seelc.

run margin.

The last two innings went without
incident as McGuire went into his
strikeout show to pick up the win in
relief.

Coach Siedleeki was pleased with
the team's performance. but felt that

perhaps Schenectady was not a true
example of the kind ofcompetition
Albany will be facing in future
games. In any event. the Danes
travel to Dartmouth. this Saturday
where they can expect to be severely
tested.
