scoreboard first with the first of his

put the ball in the net live moretimes
in the first half and allowed
Hartwick only four to come away

After the game. Albany Coach
Mike Motta indicated he was quite
pleased with his team‘s performance
but quickly pointed out that
llartwick isn't a Very tough team.

“Our defense and midfielders were
very strong today. Dave Ahonen
scored one goal and one assist on
defense and Terry Kianka bad a
good day on face-offs." said Motta.

“it was a good game for us In that

the 'three doubles matches but by
that time Colgate had already clinch-
.ed the team win. '

Despite the loss, Coach Lewis
Wasn't overly disappointed. “The
difference this year was we were
much more competitive. The
matcheswere closer than last year
when Colgate wiped us out." he said.

Lewis attributed his team's com-
petitiveness to the recent Florida trip
they took before the start of the spr-
ing season.

The team‘s overall record is now 8-
2 with both losses occurring in the
spring. Lewis indicated that the team
has upgraded its schedule and that it
could change its record.

Tomorrow. the team travels to
Binghamton‘to participate in the
third annual University Center
Championships with Buffalo and the
host team. Last year. the Danes won
the tournament which was held here.

Lewis expects the competition to
be close and Binghamton to be the
toughest. Albany just edged
Binghamton by two points in last
year‘s SUNYAC‘s to gain second
place.

Lack Of Depth Hurts Women Runners

by Christine Bellini

“We're suffering from a lack of
depth." explained coach Barbara
I’alm. “That's what’s hurtng our
team scores right now."

Having lost live of their distance
runners to injuries and illness. the
Albany State women‘s truck atid
field team is feeling that lack of
depth rather acutely.

Surfacing with an 0-4 win-loss
record for the first week ofcompeti-
tion. the team‘s individual perfor-
manccs were "quite good" according
to Palm. Many sprinters have run
times well under the qualifying stan-
dard to enter into the Regionals.

Starting the season on their own
turf. Albany faced Cornell and the
University of Connecticut in a tri-

meet last Friday. Winning by a 3-
point margin over Cornell's 59
.points. U. Conn. finished with a total
of 62 points. Finishing third in the
team tally. Albany chalked up a 44
point total.

“We‘ve finished closer to U. Conn.
this year than last but I‘m disap-
pointed in losing to Cornell.“ said
I’alm. “We couldn‘t enter in two
events because of injuries and that
really hurt us.”

I’atty Murphy. one of Albany‘s
two distance runners. entered in the
three-mile and two-mile events Fri-
day and ntanuged to come tip as vic-
tor in both. Miler Diane Socllner
took second in 5:57.7 seconds.

Displaying strength in the sprin-

ting cvcnis. Albany‘s Teresa Bates '

ran a close second in the I00 yard
dash. finishing in :l l.4seconds tothe
winning time of :l 1.0. I

Facing tougher competition on
Tuesday. Albany State traveled to
Southern Connecticut and dropped
two more against tltc Connecticut
and Rutgcr squads.

Shining out as Albany's “bright
spot." according to Palm. was miler
Soelfncr who broke Rutger‘s sweep
twice. coming in second in the I/2
ntilc and fourth in the mile events.

“Once again our lack ofdcpth hurt
us." continued I’alm. “along with the
order of events which placed the
shorter distances back to back.
Despite the record. our individual
performances are improving for
both the field and track events.“

It was one of those meets where. if
you don't win, you look for
something else to talk about. Such
was the case Tuesday as the Albany

by a strong l’lattsburgh squad 106-

“We just didn't have the depth.“

But there were some bright spots

Central Council plowed through

Council made several. additions to
DiMeo‘s budget proposals. in-

According to Central Council
Chairman 0ng Lcssnc. yesterday‘s

overSI 1.000 from the recommenda-

mittee. His budget did not include
funding for SASU. which was
allocated $9.400 last year.

“I cut that amount out of the
budget." said DiMeo. “Of that
money. $9.400 was from SASU. and
the other $2.000 or so was for flex-
ibility. Now. all of the unallocated
money is gone. Less than $9.400 is

The status of SUNYA President

DiMeo said that is “a 50-50
chance“ that Central Council will be
in favor or funding SASU on
Wednesday night. “It‘s difficult to
tell."

“SASU is an all or nothing deal.“
said SA Controller Nolan Altman.
“Membership is 85 cents per un-
dergraduate which comes out to

around $8,400. in addition to a con-'

fcrencc line of over $900.“

Altman said that he felt that senti-
tttent is in favor of SASU on Central
Council.

One problem that might arise on
Wednesday night might be a lack of
quorum. which would prevent
Council front acting on the budget.
In order to get a quorum yesterday.
four Central Council members were
asked to resign by Lcssne.

“I told them that if they weren't
going to show up to the meeting.
they‘d be much more ofan asset to us
if they resigned." said Lessne.

The resignations brought Central
Council‘s membership down to 24
members. meaning that I6 members
represents a quorum.

“If there is no quorum.“ said
Lessne. “then the budget goes over to
DiMeo.“

Lessnc said that if the budget goes
beyond its allocations a number of
alternatives can be considered. “One
alternative is raising the student tax.
Another‘is to get the moneyl’rom the
surplus tilt-budget. A t/hird'wou‘ld be

tage cut to all groups."

Alman said that he would be op-
posed to pcrce ntagc cuts and raising
the student tax.

“Raising the tax is the very last
alternative." said Altman. “I favor
using the surplus first.“

DiMeo said that “The one thingl
won't stand for would be a deficit
budget."

Lessnc said that Central Council
has until May 4 to come up withthe
completed budget. "After that time.
cvcryonc‘s term runs out."

According to Lcssne and Altman.
there are a number of reasons which
prompted SA to tighten its belt this
year.

“It‘s tight every year." said Alt-
man. “But the combination of'inila-
tion and the fact that We are getting
lower enrollment next year makes it
tougher.“

Altman wuid that because enroll-
ment will be about 300 less students
next year. which. at $66 a student.

ASP/WSUA: Asfar ot'yuu view ll,
illll‘J SA newlrlnmnnger(Ira/coder?
Robyn l’erchlk: Well. first let me say
that this year over 81.000 dollars was
spcnt on administrative costs and in-
ternal operations. To me this is a bit
too much money considering the
budget isjust over $400,000. That‘s
20 per cent ofthe budget spent on ad-
ministrative costs. I believe that I can
cut costs within the SA budget and
return programming tothc students.
llci‘orc SA can get respect from
students or from administrators.
they have to take care ofthemsclves
and get their work done and out of
the way . . . I believe i have

David Gold: I definitely suyu leader.
When people talk about the
problems with this year‘s SA. [don't
see it as basically we didn‘t branch
out into other areas. I see it that we
didn‘t go after the students. We
didn‘t excite them. We didn't initiate
them. There were no innovative
programs to bring SA to the

students. to keep them informed.
ASP/WSUA: Dave, (ls/hr as an in-

. and is even having trouble gelling a

Gold: I see it its the lack of leadership
in SA. the lack of bringing anything
to the students. As far as positions
go. when they are ttitcmpted to be
filled. they are not going to the quad
boards. or the SA groups to fill
them. I got appointed to thc CD’I‘A
bus committee because Steve
DeMco saw me around the SA office
and asked. “How would you like to
be on a committee?" There was ab-
solutely no going further than that.
As far as my Assembly of SA groups.
this has never been done onthis cunt-
pus. not since Lambert. SA has to
start using the SA groups.

ASP/ WSUA: What I want to know

(lold: Well. I do not look upon this
as bureaucracy. us far as an
academic affairs task force. I mean.
no students know what‘s going on in
academics. We have a senate liasion
coordinator. but you can go up to
students and ask them what‘s going
on with distributional requirements.
or plus/ minus grading. and they
won‘t have the I'oggiest idea.

ASP/ WSUA: Don Ilollz. what kind
of t'x/n'rlcm't' do you have. why are
you qua/flied.“

Donald llollz: I think that question
is what I expected. My answer might
deviate a little from the question. I
find this whole thing to be a sort of
fantasy. a lantasy trip playing run-
ning for office. i see the office as hav-
ing great importance. but the means
to go around scent to me not to be
what it takes. i don‘t see it as being
such njob \vl‘ere you have to have all
these qualifications. I think the
qualifications that do come out are
due to the fact that the candidates
seem to be so much the same. That

each bit of character that you can
find will do a great deal of help.
ASP/WSUA: What Ina/mumu uni-

Holtl: What makes me unique is my
qualifications. 1 have never even
thought about caring about student
government. I was a student. I went
l0 school. and I got nothing out of
the University. ljust did my classes.‘
and hada good time. and the Univer-
sity offered me nothing. I believe
that's the majority of students‘
feelings. only 20 per cent vote. so
that‘s a good per cent. So I feel. I'm
