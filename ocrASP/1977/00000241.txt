ASP/WSUA: .Wliat' pet projects,

would you like to Work'an. indepen-

dent of whoever is elected SA

president?
Markowltsz I would like to turn the
Patroon Room into something more
appealing. that caters to students. I
would like to have student control
over the Campus Center. I think
that Student Association should
become more involved in the space
problems that Draper and Alumni
Quads proposed for utilizingthe gym
under Page Hall.
Baton: The main area that I‘ve been
involved in is Health Services. On a
stale-wide level. our general health
care is pretty decent. Unfortunately.
women‘s health care is pretty poor.‘l
am presently working on a proposal.
with several other women. modeled
after projects that they have at
Fredonia and New Paltz which will
give students more input into the
decision-making process to coor-
dinate and put a lot of things
together. Another area that I'm very
interested in is voter registration. I
think it‘s important that we get the
students to register and we get them
absentee ballot. V
Aranoff: There are projects I would
like to see initiated. I don't think I
would take any pet projects under
my wing and try to do it myself. I
think the way to draw people into
Student Association is to find as
many diverse projects as you can.
and say. “Okay. here's what we want
to do: see what you can come up
‘ with.” I‘d like to see improvement in
job placement service. Right now it
is terrible. I'd like to work on the
tenants coalition. One of my pet
peeves is student tax money goingto
services that the University should
be providing.
Miller: One of'the things. as I‘ve said
before. is that I‘m dissatisﬁed with
SASU. While I don‘t think the idea
should be scraped. I think the
original idea and intent to have a
lobbying organization for higher
education to benefit the school is
good. and one of the things that
should be looked into is possible
alternatives to SASU as it stands. or
possible changeto SASU. One of the
best things that this administration
did do is the student dwellings. I
think continued effort should be
made along the lines of student
dwellings. I think low-cost. decent
off-campus housing is a very big
issue at this campus. having a ma-
jority of students living off-campus.
and I think it's one that should be
followed up on.

. Beyond the slogans and gimmicks
are reasons why each candidate for
president and vice president of SA
feels that he or she can do the best
job. So that SUNYA may see their
views on the issues. the six presiden-
tial candidates and the four vice
presidential candidates have
prepared the statements published
here.

No criterion was set except for a
200 word limit. If is hoped that by
this forum the candidates can ex-
press themselves in greater depth
than on campaign posters. and con-
vey their feelings to the voters.

varsity basketball and volleyballand
stayed long enough to get a feel of
that unique experience.‘

This experience will help me lead a
vital SA, one in which things can get
done without a committee being
formed. We have power and we must
utilize all of out resources to the
fullest. We control UAS and byexer-
cising control. food service can im-
prove. SA provides all ex-
tracurricular activities on campus
and can improve them through
reallocation and coordinated
scheduling so that there is always
something happening outside the
library. We must have a powerful say
in the academic issues that surround
us.

I know that I can provide the
leadership to propel an effective SA
and ask for your vote.

- Things must bechanged. l'he first

change must be in the “SA mentali-
ty”. 'I‘his mentality is the attitude

that presently exists. saying. “If”

students want to know what's going
on. or it'they want to get involved. let
them come up’ to the SA office. If‘
' vstudents don't;care'. too bad.”'
The change in this attitude has got
to come from the SA president. He
must reach out' to the' students'
. enthusiastically. tell them what's go-
ing on. and try to get them involved.
' I am not the only candidate who has
searched for new. innovative ways of
increasing student awareness and in-
volvement. As a Dutch Quad Cen-
tral Council representative. I created
a Council flulletin Board in the
cafeteria. posted Council reports in

Paul Feldman

Students are getting shafted on
this campus. Calendar changes have
been made. advisement has been
crippled. and good teaching faculty
have been axed. Student input has
'not been considered. and students
have suffered as a result. We must
have an important voice in this Un-
iversity. and nn active Student
Association can be that voice.

Kathy Huron and I can bring
aggressive leadership to the position
of SA vice president and president

Right now budgeting is about

than just budgeting. It must represent
the students to faculty. the ad-

on issues like the calendar changes.

:idnscmcnt. It must increase student

more than “Iundcdcd by SA".
