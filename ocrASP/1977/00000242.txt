Mtch Werner

. My name is Mitch Werner. .
Currently I am a Central Council
representative from Indian Quad.
You may have seen me referreeing
for AMlA or workinginthe food co-
op. lt may not seem to you that my
record is superior to the other can-
didates’. but that is partly due to my
having attempted to make SA a
better functioning organization in-
ternally. Along with that l build on
ideas. On many of the bills in-
dividually sponsored in Council. I
have added amendments to make
them better for a larger share of the
university community.

'l'hat wil be a basic part of my
presidential program. Not only will I
implement my own ideas. such as
checking off-campus housing for fire
irregularities. and making a more
uniform theft-resistant bookkeeping
system for all SA groups. but your
ideas as well. l'hat means being in

the Rat. grabbing you on the
podium, handing out questionaires
with beer. anything to get you. You
see it’s more than SA coming to you.
lhaveto make you think and want to
tell me your ideas. The job is more
than what I want. It's your views that
count.

VP Hopefuls

 

Jim Aronoff

The most important aspect to look
for in an SA vice president is ver-
satility. The reason is simple: the vice
president must complement the
president. whoever he orshe may be.
i huvethis versitility. as seen through
my experience.

As an active member of Central
Council and Class of ‘79 vice
chairperson. l have worked
successfully in areas in which
students have complete control.

through the work of two other
students and .nysell on President

Field's Special Committee; it baa '
been shown that dealing with ad-
ministrators in an intelligent, ar-
ticulate manner produces positive
results. Due to out; work, there will
not be strict distribution re-
quirements at SUNYA next year.
SA's involvement in policy-making
is essential. for we comprise a major
portion of the university communi-
ty. >
Finally. SA should be involved in
the communityat large. I have serv-
ed in this capacity as a director on
the Board of Student Dwellings. a
corporation which will operate low-
cost housing for students.

Look carefully at all the can-
didates for vice president. Look at
what they have done. Ask what they
plan to do. Then decide who would
best represent you in the community.
to the administration. and to other
students.

toward our long awaited successes.

Something must be done to im-
prove the communication failures
which exist in SA's internal and ex-
ternal relationships. Campaigning
and budget proceedings should'not
be the only time SA relates to
students and groups.

Our failure to speak out on
academic issues. an integral part of
every student‘s life. cannot continue
to be it permanent blemish on Stu-
dent Association‘s record.

The failure of Student Association
to make an effort to change the
operation of an administration con-
trolled Campus Center into a Union
operated by students for students is
unfortunate and tin action long over-
due.

Campaign promises. like a rain-
bow. are pretty to look at hilt not
much on substance. ll lthought that
promises would he delivered. l
would not be running for SA vice
president. I do not lault my op-
poncnts lor their Idctts nor do i
doubt their good Intentions. I choose
to run because I believe I have done
the Jtlh in the past and that what I
have learned Will make me more
capable to serve In the Ititure.
