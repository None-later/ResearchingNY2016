these and other “surest proofs". But one thing is
certain. To associate such beliefs wrth Jews &

The Persian King Cynts is so called in
ISAIAH 45, t it is to CYRUS that the reference
is made in Daniel. NOT in the seme they read
into it.

       
  
      
  
 
  
   
   
 
 
   
     
  

  

     
 

Judaism believes in only One G-d &
forbids deiﬁcation of man. And all this
preaching is offensive to our credo: “HEAR O
ISRAEL THE L-RDOURG-D, THE L-RD IS
ONE

          
    

   

  
 
 
 
  

 
 

Some of their other claims are fanciful
extrapolations. forcing meaning into words.
which say something else entirely.

The piece of missionary propaganda
cominncd to tell us what to believe. followed by
sacral ‘suren proﬁt“ to retail converts. These
“Sm prod? came from the Old testament
which supposedly left no choice but tosmrender
on their terms . . .

NOW . . .

it‘s one thing to preach &
missionize. bin it‘s grate another to distort facts
and mist meanings to ﬁt one‘s belief. And so for
the sale of fairness 8'. honesty. these “surest
proofs" should he denature. '

NOW some IMPOSSIBILITIES:
Granted that the Jewish Messiah will come from
DAVID and the tribe of JUDAH. It is well
known that BIBLICAL Genealogies always
inﬂow through the father.

arrested in Mexico carrying small
amounts of Heroin. cocaine or mari-
juana for their own pcruonal use.
The government‘s decision currently
immediater affects about 2000 per-
sons. including 30 Americans. who
have been arrted. but not tried. for
possessing small quantities of drugs.

Mexican Attorney General Oscar
Flores Sanchez said that. in the
future. charges would be dropped
when drug quantities seized are com-
mensurate with what he called “nor-
mal" personal use —— and not for sale
to others. The government‘s an-
nouncement signalled a radical
change of policy for Mexico. which
over the past ﬁve years has received
millions of dollars in U.S. anti—drug
funds in stepped up efforts to
prosecute all persons caught with
drugs in Mexico.

Sanchez stated that obvious drug
trafﬁckers would be imprisoned. but
he added thc ones who usually get
caught are “the small fry." Current-
ly. almost 600 Americans are now in
Mexican jails. with nearly half of
them charged with possession of
minor amounts of drugs.

HAPPINESS IS . . .

Happiness for drought-stricken
northern California may be a gigan-
tic hunlt of ice.

The Christian Science Monilor
reports that navy weather people are
eying the world‘s largest iceberg; a

hunk of ice 45 miles long. 25 miles
wide and l000 feet thick. which has
drifted |800 miles from the Antarctic
coast during the past IO years.

 

The Monitor reports that scien-
tists have been trying to ﬁgure out
how that iceberg might be towed to
an arid land, including parched
northern California, to be used as a
water source. The newspaper
predicts that if a safe economical
way to tow such an iceberg could be
found. California could be provided
with enough fresh water from that
one iceberg to last “00 years.
