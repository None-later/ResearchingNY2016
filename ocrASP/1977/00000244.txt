OFFICE OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS

Research. And Service Center
To Be Established Here

Plans are proceeding for the
establishment here of the Government
Research and Service Center following
approval by the State Legislature in
budgetary action. Dean Vincent O‘Lcary
of the School of Criminal Justice. was
appointed by President Fields to head the
IS member steering committee
responsible for organizing the new center.
the first major step in the university‘s
public policy analysis thrust as part ofits
developing mission.

The center is envisioned as having
responsibility for coordinating and
facilitating policy-oriented projects
calling for the application of specialized
knowledge to major issues and problems.
Described as a SUNY-widc entity. it is
being designed to make more effective the
study of public policy and to generate
alternative solutions for consideration by
policy makers.

Other members of the steering

committee are John Dewey. geological
science; Robert (iocttlc. educational
policy. programs. and institutions:Josiali
Gould. philosophy; James Hcaphcy.
public administration; Dean William
Holstein. School of Business; Nan Lin.
sociology; Paul Marr. geography; Eugene
McLarcn. chemistry; Thad Mircr.
economics; Volkcr Mohncn. director
Atmospheric Sciences Research Center;
[ﬁrm Gilbert Moore. School of
Education; Phillip Tompkins. rhetoric
and communication; Vice President for
University Affairs Lewis Welch; and
Ronald Stout. political science.
' One of two primary purposes of the
cénter is to identify issues and problems
of major concern to state government
officials and legislators. The other is to
facilitate application of the university‘s
expertise to analysis of those issues and
problems.

The director of the center. for whom
recruitment is getting underway. will
report to the vice president for academic
affairs but will work closely with
President Fields and academic deans as
appropriate. One of the director's duties
will be the cstziblishmcnt ofclosc working
relationships with other SUNY campuses
and with the SUNY Research
Foundation.

A small professional staff will be
employed to provide both intellectual and
administrative leadership in
accomplishing the center‘s goals. While
many projects will be conducted within
the schools and departments here. it is
expected that some individual faculty will
be aligned with the center on joint
appointments for the execution of major
projects.

The tc ntativc budget for the initial year

later this year is between 585.000 and
$90.000. For the state fiscal year. which
began April I. the budget is about
$70.000.

Commenting on the new center,
President Fields noted. in part. “Many
faculty and students are alrcady engaged
in policy studies. in areas ranging from
educational finance to models of the New
York State economy. The new Center for
Governmental Rcsearch and Services will
play a major role in facilitating and
broadening such efforts and in bringing
the University‘s experience to be" on
matters of grcat importance to the State."

Dean ()‘I.cary said that central to the
operation of the center is the formation of
a principal advisory group made up of
representatives of the several branches of
govcrnmcnt. of public interest groups.
and of the university. and from the public
at large. The members will idcntify policy
arctts and issucs to whichthc ccntcr might
address its program.

In addition to the advisory group. said
Dean 0‘l.cat'y. there will be a liaison
network to ensure effective coordination
with university faculty. He stressed that
the work of the center will not displace
independent research efforts of university
faculty members and that the center‘s
program will further encourage
cooperation between the university
researchers and governmental leaders.

Dr. I.in heads the seminar
subcommittee of the steering committee;
Dr. Tompkins. the subcommittee for
director recruitment; and Dean Holstein.
the subcommittee for program.

Dean Holstein said that a series of
presidential luncheon seminars is being
planned for representatives of
government. public interest groups. and
the university to explore policy-related
topics. From the discussions will emerge
on agenda of interests and a pattern of
working relationships for the future.
