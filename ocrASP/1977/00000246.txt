tried to do anything with the directory exec money offit, '3 ' . ‘_ T; ,
The directory did not arrive until November this fall, and yet'Was accurate only to
what the unversity hail listed in September. The private company's problems have.
become our problems—they had problems at their plant, we didn't pt the directory.
They also extend their advertising deadlines to make more money, and that has delayed
delivery also. ‘ _'
For next fall, the university has canceled its contract with the private company. The
directory will be produced by the ASP, “prepared by the administration, backed
financially by UAS and, hopefully, will contain more information. The ASP will
subcontract the advertising sales work to a local companyand tointerested students.
The purpose of the survey is to get a sense of what members of the university com-
munity would like to see in their directory. Any additional comments would be most

   

What should be in the directory that isn't? Give us any
suggestions you can think of that would be useful:
Academic Calendar, where to go for what, grievance
procedure, etc.

Any other comments or suggestions are welcome. The
university directory can be more than a list of names, but
it's going to be hard to decide what 'to include in the
available space. That's why we want feedback.
