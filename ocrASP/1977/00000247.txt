Good acting can often 'be the saving
grace of an otherwise poor play. Lavish
costumes can often disguise one. So can a
beautiful set. But none of these
statements apply to The Beaux
Strategem, presented at the PAC last
week, for it was a well-acted, and
beautifully designed production of
George Farquhar‘s comedy set in the
eighteenth century.
Large Cast
Sincethe play had such a large cast, it is
difficult to mention every actor. All gave
convincing portrayals, but a few stand
out in this critic's mind.

performance as Archer, one of the two

command of the language and a
commanding stage presence. Yet,
Learning was 'also comical when the part
called for it.

Delightful

John Murray was delightful as
l-‘oigard, a priest. His French accent is .
exaggerated, and at times, it seemed to
turn into an Irish accent. However, this is
exactly what was called for in his part,
since we find out that he is an Irish priest _
posing as a French one.

Doug Albert is very funny as Scrub, the
servant to Mr. Sullen who never seems to
know what is going on. His expressions
and body positions are quite comical.

giddy girl who only knows herselfin love.

throughout the play. Louise Alfasso is
also lively as Cherry, the landlord's
daughter. .

The blocking was done well
throughout the play. Characters moved
on stage with ease. The duel scene was
perhaps one of the best. The men used
their swords deftly, while the women
screamed and stood on the sides, creating
a fast-moving scene full of excitement.

The set, designed by Phil Eickhoff,
captured the essence and spirit of an
eighteenth century countryhouse. The
contrast of light and dark stained woods
in the floor, doors, and walls gave the
scene a rustic look.

The eighteenth century costumes were
beautiful in every detail. The rich fabrics
and vivid colors gave life to the stage.

Al Stewart’s performance last
Thursday night at the Palace Theatre
"proved to be a 'frustrating
disappointment. The hoarseness of Al's
voice; and the brevity of his set (70
minutes) belied the fact that he was ill.

The concert opened with an
unexpectedly, musically entertaining set
by Wendy Waldman. A veteran
performer, Wendy originally started out
as a coffeehouse folksinger. She has since
matured into a seasoned stage performer
with amazing versatility and depth.

Although the set lacked the usual vocal
liveliness, it was far from bad. For most of
the concert, Al relied on material from his
latest album, Year of the Cat, including
such songs as: “Midas Shadow," “Flying
Socery," and “If it Doesn't Come
Naturally, Leave It," as well as the
' album's title song, “Year of the Cat." The
high point of the show, however, was his
song “Roads to Moscow,“ from his Past,

Present, and Future.

' Unfortunately for this song, as with
many of the others, Al seemed to be
rushing it, at one time even singing the
wrong words to his song, “Modern
Times.“ Several times, the band took
instrumental breaks, trying to
compensate for Al‘s voice. Many were
good, except for classical guitar solo by
the keyboard player Peter Whiter. His
tone was horrible, to say the least.

For all of AI Stewart's style and
quality, his illness clearly detracted from
the concert. Yet, even under such adverse
the concert could be
considered better than a lot of touring

'musicians in.exccilent health. For an

audience however. in excellent health,
shelling out $5 or $7 for the concert, 3
little bit more is expected.

After a surprisingly short intermission,

Al Stewart came on stage, opening with a A

song from his Modern Times album,
“Apple Cider Re-Constitution" (which-is
about the British railway system). The
band seemed to overpower the vocals due
to Al's sickness. For this tour, and as well
as in the past, AI has constantly been
plagued by sore throats and illness,
forcing him to continuously cancel and
re-schedule concerts.

The Broken Flow

By GUY FRANKIE

I'm one ofthose people who paya lot of
attention to movie ads. It‘s always
interesting to see how the rriovie
companies are pushing their latest
products. I found the ad campaign for the
recently released Islands in the Stream to
be particularly fascinating. 'The big
headline in the ad reads, “When was the
last time you saw a really good movie?“
Well, I saw Islands last night and it‘s still
been a couple of weeks since I saw a really
good movie.

Islands in the Stream is based upon the
posthumously published novel by Ernest
Hemingway. I haven't read the book, but
ifthe story is as loosely constructed as it is
in the movie, lwould have to surmisethat
it is not one of Hemingway‘s greatest
achievements. As scripted by Denne
Pctitclou, Islands has a very fragmented
narrative. Essentially, there are three
sections which are tied together by the
presence of Tom Hudson, an American
sculptor living in near isolation on an
island in the Gulf Stream. In the first he is
visited by his three sons, in the second by
his former wife, and in the third he helps a
Jewish family fleeing the Nazis. (The
story takes place in l940.)

'l he main problem is that each section
is complete in itself, and so the film is not
a unified whole. The first section of the

film in fact, would make a very interesting
work with some further' detail and
development. Certainly the first hour of
the film is the best, but it introduces
numerous concepts (Hudson‘s fear of
death, his relationship with his sons)
which are only minimally developed. Left
hanging with these bits and pieces, the
rest of the film becomes confusing. I
understand that Hemingway had
intended to work further on Island:
before its publication. Had he been able
to, perhaps the storyline would have been
more coherent.

The film stars two of my favorite.
thespians, George C. Scott and Claire
Bloom. As Hudson, Scott gives a
creditable performance which is bogged
down only by the numerous maudlin
sequences in the opening section. His best
moment is at the beginning ofthe film. 0n
the night before the arrival of his sons,
Hudson gets very drunk with some
friends and ends up shooting flares at the
boats and houses of people he dislikes.
Despite the Ilamboyance of the scene, we
are given a picture of Hudson as a man
torn between terror and joy. The credit
for the success of this scene goes solely to
Scott. As Hudson's ex-wif'c, Bloom is
steady and restrained in a role which
demands these qualities. The second
section of the film, in which these two

a some?

very' great actors meet head on, is
memorable only because of their
presence. .

The film is directed by Franklin J.
Schaf'fner, whose previous .work
(including Patton and Pupil/on) has
established himself as a maker of large
entertainments. He takes very much a
back seat to the script in the artistic
creation of the film, but his direction is by
no means slip-shod. The shark and sail
fish sequences in the first part ofthe film
are masterfully handled. Both are sharply
edited and well photographed.
Occasionally, his compositions are quite
brilliant. A large, partially eroded rock
stands in front of Hudson‘s house, and
Schaffner often includes it in his shots so
that it becomes a metaphor for both
Hudson and his art. At the end ofthe film,
as Hudson is dying, there is a close-up of
Hudson‘s face as he lies on a cushion.
Suddenly, a fly lands in the upper left
hand corner of the frame and crawls
slowly toward the dying man. In its
simplicity, the shot is brilliant.

Islands in the Stream is not, as the ads
say. a really good movie. It is a
competently made film with some very
good moments. Unfortunately. none of
its good qualities are strong enough to
redeem the entire picture. it is an
evening's entertainment, but little else.
