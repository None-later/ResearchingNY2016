matter.

A six-goal outburst by Uéneseo. in

soon after. Friend. on a feed from
Gleason from behind the cage tallied
to open up a 9-5 lead.

After the Danes were stopped on
one of several artistic saves by goalie
Dave l'iarini. Brady narrowed the
gap to three on his second goal on
the soggy field. This goal. with 81I9
left in the period. seemed to anger
the visitors as they tallied four times
in seven minutes. Albany's defense
fell apart. enabling Friend. Gleason.
and Barranco (twice). to beat Miller
and reserve goalie Willie Draughon.
By the time the attack had subsided.

the game was virtually decided. as

’the Danes trailed by seven.

All Albany could manage in the
final period was a goal by Uraziose.

the period. making the final margin
of victory stand at seven goals.

Motta cited excessive penalties.
the inability to get the ball in the
offensive half of the field. poor
shooting. and excellent goaltending
by their opponents. as the major
reasons for the defeat. The Danes
will try to even their record at 4-4
when they travel to Union on
