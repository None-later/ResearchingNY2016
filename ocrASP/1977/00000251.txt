pattern for this young season.
Albany‘s attempt to topple the .500
barrier was thwarted once again.

Albany head coach Michael Mot-

mediocre showing. “The weather
had nothing to do with it." he said.

it appeared that the Danes. play-

talented Ucneseo a challenge. At-

afternoon with 5:05 gone in the first
period. all an assist from midfielder

Central Council race but unless
formal complaints from candidates
in that race are received. the race
would he considered valid.

“There‘s always talk of
violations." said Dowd. “All they do
is get me mad." Sotnc candidates htid
charged that opponents had cam-
paigned too close totlie polls. Others
charged that some known campaign
workers had manned various polls.

cording to election officials. “lt‘s ab-

by Thomas Martcllo

Classes will be scheduled during

I979-ltt) school year as u res ult of ac-
tion taken Wednesday by the
Educational Policies Committee,

'I he committee voted to have full
registration begin the first 'l‘uesday
in September. and to schedule op-
tional classes on Rosh Hashanah
and Yom Kippur. The committee
also voted to have the spring
registration begin the first Monday
after Jan. 20. and to schedule 1 he spr-
ing vacation in the eighth or ninth
week of the semester. even if it
doesn‘t coincide with the Easter and
Passover holidays.

The committee‘s vote was based
largely on a survey taken of students

(iovcrning Board. This includes
$600 for an outhousc :accessi hle to
handicapped students.

An appropriation of $l000 to

l‘ricnds of the Pierce “if” Day

scycriil Council members had been
"rather rowdy". He noted. "It goes a
terrible impression to the people
coming to us to talk business."

Due to sciciiil resignations this
week. Central Council is down to a
incnihciship of 2|. A quorom now
amounts to |USl l4 \olcs.

to doubt that a quorum will be pre-

consider next year‘s athletic budget.

and faculty members on the subject.
The survey was sent out to 400
students and 300 faculty members.
Student opinion showed 50 percent
in favor of cancelling classes on
religious holidays with 40 per cent
against and ft) per cent undecided.

The faculty response was in direct
contrast. ()f the faculty members
who responded to the poll. only f2
per cent were in favor of cancelling
classes on religious holidays. as com-
pared to 80 per cent against. with
eight per cent undecided.

Faculty Dominant

“What it showed. I think is that
the council gave much more weight
to the faculty‘s response."said Assis-
tant to the President R. Fredericks
Volkwein. who chaired the com-
mittec.

"Seeing dwindled student
response. there was a feeling that in-
tcrcst was low. By contrast. interest
was high with the faculty. of the
faculty members polled. 73 per cent
responded. as compared to 26 per
cent of the students." '

the committee‘s vote was un-
animous. Of the eight students on
the cotnmittcc. one was present til
the meeting.

"We looked at the reason for the
lots student input and rejected two
hypotheses." said Volkwein. “The
first was that there was a flaw insen-
ding them out. that is doubtful. The
second was that students didn't
return the questionaires because
they didn't feel they would have any
substantial influence.“

Volkwcin said that he didn't know
lion the dcctsion of the committee
would have swung had there been a
clear student mandate against the
change.

“ l'hcrc‘s no doubt that would have
made the decision more difficult.“
said Volkwein.

Volkwcin said that students
wishing to observe the religious
holidays that coincide with the new
schedule would not be penalized.

"’l‘hat‘s fine and good." said JSC-
llillcl Director Steve Shaw. "llut

whatever happens in that class. a
micw. anything. the student who
misses the class for religious reasons
“I” lose out. Ilcsidcs. they can't
pcnull/c kids for not goitigto cl; .'
on religious holidays. It's against the
law."

According to section 224a of the
liducation Inn of the state of New
York. “Any student if] an institution
of higher education who is unable.
because of his religious beliefs. toat-
tend classes on a particular day or
days shall. because ol'such absence
on the particular day or days. be ex-
cused lrotn any examination or any
study or work requirements."

"We obviouslv saw ii great deal of
opposing points. said Volkwein.
"They were written in with the sur-
vey, But there were also a lot of peo-
ple who feel that it is ridiculous to
suspend classes in the middle ofthc
week."

"l'ni very disappointed that
they're rcncging on a committiucnt
they made six years ago." said Shaw.
"Making a sludcnl choose between
religion and academics is unfair."

.lS(‘ Action

According to Show and JSC Co-
Chairman fan Arctis. the JSC Will
meet in the near future to discuss
possible action against the decision.

“Nobody consulted the .lSC. the
