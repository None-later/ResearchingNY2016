ELECTRO-TORTURE
The American-backed govern-
ment in Singapore has launched a
crackdown on journalists and
foreign correspondents who are ac:
cused of reporting stories that are
harmful to the government. The
publication Far Eastern Economic
Review reports that its correspon—
dent in Singapore, along with at least
nine other reporters. was recently
arrested and jailed by the govern-
mcrtt of President Lee Knan Yew on
charges of subversion. Some of the
journalists have since been released.
but onlyatler a number ofthem were
allegedly tortured by their jailcrs.
Singapore‘s President Lee has
never been an ardent supporter of
the press. He once startled a news
conlercncc by telling reporters that
“In addition to all the conventional
pressures we have learned from the
West. we also have special in-
quisitional instruments. ancient

Americans purchased one-and-a-

year. and now they will be offered

The Japanese Mitsubishi Electric

Company says it will soon begin‘

marketing a microwave oven that
enables the cook to preset the oven
to start cooking 99 hours later.
Current American-made ovens per-
mit only four to five hours of preset
cooking time. Mitsubishi explains
that the reason for the 99 hours is

that many Americans would like to I

' the seizure of two I

boats off New England earlier
month rriises the possibility that the
U.S. Coast Guard could triggerJ . _
international incident by accidental- '
ly» seizing a Soviet electronic spy ’
ship. Pacific News says that in the
shadow of the 5000 Soiliet ﬁshing
boats is a smaller fleet of some 60
ships whose missionistocollectelec-
tronic intelligence on military in:
stallations along the U.S. coastlines.
The U.S. Coast Guard. in responseto
these allegations. insists that the ac-
cidental seizure of a Soviet spy ship
is very unlikely. Coast Guard of-
ﬁcials claim they can tell the

difference between a true fishing
trawler and a spy ship. even if the
latter is disguised.

Pacific News. however. quotes
Jane‘s l‘ighting Ships. the standard
reference work on world navies. as
reporting a strong similarity in
design between the bulls of Soviet
trawlers and their electronic
monitoring ships. There has been
evidence in recent years that the
Soviets have been intercepting U.S.
phone conversations. and that much
ol this eavesdropping is done by
ships that can monitor micro-wave
communications along the U.S.
coast. lhe U.S. has its own ships
which monitor Soviet waters. Accor-
ding to I’aetlic News. Soviet
monitoring ships have occasionally
violated U. S. territorial waters: but
when they do. says I’NS. they are re-
uchth to leave rather than seircd.
