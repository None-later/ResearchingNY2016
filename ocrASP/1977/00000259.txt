lithe ASPcould endorse Aronoff. why not

' To the Editor:
‘ As of Wednesday, April 20, astudent patrol‘

has been set up in cooperation with the
university police. There will be five patrols per
night 'of two persons each. There will be four
on the- uptown campus and one on the
downtown campus. They will be under the
supervision of students in conjunction with

a the Director of Public Safety.

Patrol members will be equipped with two-
way radios to maintain communication with
security. Via the radios, requests for escorts
will be relayed from security to the
appropriate patrol unit. Patrollers will also
use the radios to report anything which they
feel warrants further investigation.

It is tentatively planned that student
patrollers will be supplied with pass keys to the
dorms. Upon presentation of a student
identification card. students will be let into
their dorms. Student patrols will also be
expected to periodically check the fire
extinguishers in the dorms and respond to ﬁre
alarms. The patrollers will not have keys to
suites or any other doors inside the dorm.

Student patrollers will bt. required to wcara
white laminated ID card. They will also be
required to present their university lD's upon
request. Do not hesitate or be embarrassed to
request an escort. The number to call is 457-
7770. This escort service is one of the main
purposes of the patrol program. it will be in
service Sunday through Thursday from 7:30
pm. until l:30 am. Friday and Saturday
nights the service will run one hour later.

In addition to its official functions it is
hoped that the patrol will serve as a liaison
between the students and the university police.
Hopefully. studcnts will become more aware
of the role the police play on the university
campus.

 Interest  s . 

    

Conflict of interest has always been treated very casually

student group. on'Ccntral Council, voting on bills that affect his. group.
These conﬂicts are recognized and even questioned occasionally, but

. sible for the athletic budget to resign just because he is “no stranger to
the athletic world." '
in the real world, however, a man with a controlling interest in

stances where even student politicians should avoid such conflicts.

Elections, to be Specific. There is no excuse for having candidates in-
volved at all, either counting ballots or manning polls. I

The standard impropricties were present, of course: electioneering, a
shortage of ballots, and a general ignorance by those manning polls of
election procedures. Radical changes in voting would be necessary for
cures here. But last year’s problems withthe Myskania ballot counting
should have at least served as a warning to tighten up the counting.

It would involve more money, more people and more time, but it’s the
only ways to quiet the cries for invalidation of the election.

Calendar Concerns

The Educational Policies Committee's decision to schedule classes on
religious holidays is clearly an attempt to appease the faculty at the ex-
pense of the students.

In a survey taken bythe committee, the faculty was overwhelminglyin
favor of this change, while student opinion was against it.

Only 26 per cent ofthc students surveyed made a response, however.
The El’C took this as meaning that students were disinterested in the
matter, and therefore supported the strong faculty opinion.

In reality. it was as much the fault of the committee that the response
was so low. Over half of the surveys were sent to students at their homes
during the February vacation.

Although El’C chairman R. Fredericks Volkwein has said that this
should have increased student response, in actuality it was discouraging
it. One must consider that a number of students did not go home for the
week; those who went on vacation probably never saw the survey.

Students should not be asked to make a decision between their studies

.and their religious responsibilities. Students should not be kept away
from their families during the celebration of holidays because of classes.
Student opinion should not be discarded in favor of letting some faculty
members have 21 Labor Day conference.
