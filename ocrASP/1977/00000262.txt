Last Saturday. the Albany State
RugbyClub travelled to Hamilton
College and were defeated 4-0. play-
ing on a Fain-soaked field.

The rain continued throughout
the game and the wet and cold con-
ditions made ball-handling next to
impossible.

Hamilton. coming oil' a l0-4 vic-
tory over Hartwick. started off on
the right foot against Albany. taking
a 4—0 lead eight minutes into the
game. A Hamilton scrumback
romped twenty five yards for the try.
but the conversion kick missed.

The two teams pushed each other
up and'down the field the entire
game. but Hamilton managed to

protect its slim '4-llilead. and hand
the taggers their second defeat ol‘the
spring season. V . -

Albany‘s Captain Niall MeStay
said of the game. “Our backs should
have kicked for position instead of
running the ball on a bad field. The
serum played well. but they were up
against an experienced Hamilton
scrum.“

Dropped "B" Game

The ruggers also dropped the “B”
game to Hamilton. losing l2-0. The
A team‘s record stands at 2-2. while
the B team's record dropped to 0-4.
This weekend. the ruggers travel to
the Rochester Institute of
Technology for the Upstate New
York Rugby Tournament.

N The finals'promise to be a more
heated contest than any of its
predecessors. Siena's offense is pac-
ed by the dynamic trio of Toomey.
Kutney anerackuback, who have
combined for; an average of almost
55 ppg. in'th'e tournament. They are
also very strong off the glass and
could pose problems for the Tokens.

Albany, however. is also a
powerhouse intramural team. Its top
three scorers in the competition;
Steve Pass at l5.5 ppg.. Ted Ferris
(l5.5) and Ray Gay (l5) have been
strongly supported by the dominant
rebounding of forward Aubrey
Brown and center Warren Miller. In
addition. Curtis Lloyd. .Ioe
Williams. Don Whietly. and Leroy
Andrews comprise a formidable
bench.

For the second time in less than
three months.” the prize of number
one Capital District basketball team
is at stake and with it comes what
should be a memorable struggle. Ad-
