Education Needs More Women

Whilc‘ women have made signiﬁ-
cant progress in access to post-
secondary education in New York
State as students. they are still
drastically under-represented as
faculty members and ad-
ministrators. concludes a report
released by the State Education
Department entitled. “Women in
Higher Education in New York
State.“

The report. compiled by the
Department's Resource Center on
Womenin Higher Education. shows
that among adults in the State who
graduated from high school. 26 per
cent of the men and only 15 per cent
of the women completed four or
more years of college. More women
than men completed one or three
years of college. while more men
completed two or four years.

“This is not surprising.“ the report
points out. “because women.
historically. have selected careers in
areas such as nursing. medical
technology. cosmetology. and
business office technology that re-
quirc one-year or three-year
diplomas and certificates. This trend

Editor's Note: This story was provid-
ed by the State Education Depart-
ment.

is changing. however."

Nationally. New York State ranks
first among the larger states in the
proportion of“ female students
enrolled in higher education. As a
percentage of available population.
in 1975 8.0 per cent of the men and
6.5 per cent of the women were
enrolled in a post-secondary institu-
tion. For w_omen. this represents
more than a 50 per cent increase. as
161.000 more women were enrolled
in degree—credit programs than in

1970.

The increase in female enrollment
has been particularly pronounced at
the advanced degree level. the report
shows. The number of women
enrolled as first professional degree
students has more than doubled in
the past five years. while the number
of men has actually declined.
However. the report points out that
women still account for only 23.4
per cent of the first professional
enrollments.

On the negative side. the report
says there are areas “where change
for women has been minimal." Hir-
ing patterns for college and universi-
ty faculty show almost no change.
the report finds. and “the proportion
of women faculty members has in-
creased only slightly.“

New York State is somewhat
above the national average. In 1974-
75. 26.2 percent of all full-time in-
structional faculty posts were held
by women. This is up from 24.4 per
cent in 1972-73.

In addition. the report shows that
women faculty. nationally and in
New York.continueto earn lessthan
their male colleagues. The difference
in national average salaries for men
and women for all ranks was about
2| percent in 1972-73 1314.360 Vs.
$11.90”. In New York State. the
difference in salaries for men and
women ranges from three to ten per
cent. depending on rank.

Women are also under-
represented at the highest levels of
administration in higher education.
the report shows. There are still only
a few women college presidents. and
with the exception of' women's
colleges. relatively few women hold
top administrative posts. In New
York in 1975-76. out of 238 degree-
grunting institutions. only 22 had

. fcnialc presidents and all but four of

these were non-secular.

The report concludes that more
women are needed on faculties. par-
ticularly at the upper levels. and
women presidents should no longer
be a rarity.

SAME ASYLUM,

You‘ve heard of insane asylums?
Well. America's first sane asylum
may be just around the corner.
Darold Treffert. the director ofthe
Winnebago Mental Health Institute
in Wisconsin. last year proposed the
building of a nationwide system of
sane asylums. where he says the
“worried well" can escape for a while
to relax before they become
“worried sick." Treffert now reports
that the Tellurian Community. In-
corporated. a non-profit corpora-
tion. is currently negotiatingto buy
the site of the first sane asylum on a
IOOO-acre estate In Green Lake.
Wisconsin. The mental health
worker says the cost of therapy
would be about $25 if ds y instead of
the current psych’ 1. .its‘ fees of
about $50 an hour. 'l'rcffert says he
wants to see sane asylttnis crop upull
over the country. but is trying to
avoid having the operations turn
into what he calls "a sort of Ken-
tucky fried sane asylum“ franchise.

VIOLENT WORLD

The publishers of a new monthly
magazine that features nothing but
violeitce and mayhem report that
their first issue is selling out at
newsstands around the United
States. Jesse Leaf. the editor of
Violent World. says that alter just
one week on the newsstands. copies
of the magazine are being bought up
so last that both readers and dis-
tributors arc delugingthc New York
of lice \\'llll calls. literally begging for
more.

The cover of the first issue of
l io/ent World. features a picture of
a nianjumping to his death from a
balcony. and a photo of a baby that
had been beaten to death. May‘s

issue. according to Leaf. includes a
cover photo of a truck driver being
crushed to death in the cab of his
truck. and a badly mauled shark at-
tack victim. Leaf says that the initial
reports from newsstands this week
are “very encouraging.“ Heexplains:
“The sex magazine market is
saturated. Violence is goingto be the
next big thing in this field. and we‘re
on the ground floor.“

PATH FINDER

The latest weapon in the U.S.
government‘s crackdown on drug
smuggling is a massive computer
system soon to be installed in El
I’aso. Texas. ctilled "Pathfinder."
Pathfinder is the name for a $2
million data center which reportedly
will be able to coordinate informa-

tion received by at least six federal
agencies including the Drug En-
forcement Administration and the
U.S. Customs Service — A about drug
smugglers at the U.S.—Mexican
border. lhc new system will begin

taaily take over all the chores
currently divided among 14 separate

duties will be to zero in on small-
craft airplanes flying across the
Mexican border with possible drug
cargoes. To assist in nabbing
smugglers. Pathfinder reportedly
will have access to the Pentagon‘s en-
tire defense mapping service. The
government is taking no chances in
locating Pathfinder so .close to
smugglers‘ territory. Pathfinder‘s
computer “brain reportedly will be
housed in Washington. with all its
data bein g sent to El Paso in
scrambled form over leased
telephone wires.

EXPLOSIVE BITS

At least nine of the biggest
publishing houses in New York have
reportedly been offered t he exclusive
rights to explosive material on the
Howard Hughes empire that was
stolen from a Hughes corporate of-
ficc in 1.05 Angcles nearlythree years
ago. The material has reportedly
fallen into the hands of freelance
writer Michael Drosnan and former
State Department officer John
Marks. the co—author of a best-
selling book on the CIA.

The Village Vor‘re reports that
many of the hundreds of pages of
documents are written in Hughes‘
own hand. They reportedly detail
such things as alleged pay-offs 'to

- leading politicians. including H ubert

Humphrey. and the strategy used by
Hughes to take over Air West Air-
lines and Las Vegas gambling
operations. The documents are ap-
parently part ofthe two file cabinets
full of material that were takcti at
gunpoint by masked bandits who
field up the Hughes corporate head-

in“

quarters in Hollywood on the night.
of June 5th. 1974.

The Volt'e'reports that New Titties
magazine editors renewed some of
the material under conditions of
“zealous security" at a New York.
hotel last February. and were
preparing to publish an entire issue
on the papers. That New Timesissue
was suddenly halted. however. Since
that time. the papers have been
offered at high prices to at least nine
book publishers; not one ol'them has-
yet agreed to purchase and publish
the material. The New York Times
says that one memo written in
Hughes‘ hand in 1968 instructs his
underlings to hire former Kennedy
political workers immediately
following the assassination of
Robert Kennedy.

The Times notes that shortly after
that memo was written. former
Kennedy director Lawrence 0' Brian
went to work for Hughes. Four years
later. the Watergate scandal began.
when the burglars were arrested in-
side O‘Brian‘s Washington office in
the Watergate complex as they
reportedly attempted to retrieve in-
formation on the Hughes-O‘Brian
connection.

XEROX — TOO GOOD

The new color copying machine
made by Xerox. known as the
“Xerox 6500." has reportedly
triggered a boom in counterfeiting
from coast to coast. The Wall Street
Journal reports that the machine is
being used to forge everything from
payroll checks and stock certificates
to postage stamps and bus transfers.
