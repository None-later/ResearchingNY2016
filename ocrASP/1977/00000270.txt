The Albany State varsity tennis
team suffered its first shutout ever
under the coaching of Robert Lewis
by losing 9-0 to the University of
Massachusetts last Thursday. The
loss was the team's third of the yea}
and lowered its record to 9-3.

The Danes made the ‘ trip to
Massachusetts without the services
of their number three player. Mitch
Sandler. “Without Sandlcr. we had
to move everyone up one step and it
affected our matchupti.“ Lewis said.
“Had Sisndler made the trip. I feel
the score might have been closer.
possibly 7-2 or 5-4." he added.

The surprise of the match was
Massachusetts‘ Adam Rosen who
upset Paul Feldman in the number
one singles match. Rosen. after los—

Keith I’crnicc and Claire (ioldner
played strong doubles tennis as they
combined to take the first tinnqu
AMlA/WIRA Mixed Doublcs'l'cn-
nis Tournament, held last Saturday
on the Dutch Quad courts. Seven-

which lasted almost six hours on the
breezy April afternoon.

the tough challenging team of Ed
Miller and Patty lfaslidorl to the
win. and they did so in straight sets.
7-6 and but. The pair attributed the
victory to (ioldner's consistent hard
returns and l’crnice‘s qurckness iii
getting to what appeared to be sure
“winners.”

ing the first set 3-6. came back to win
the next two by scores of 7-Sand 7-5.
Feldman had a chance to win the
match-as he was leading Satin the
third set and had one match point.
He couldn‘t cash in on it.

For Feldman. the defeat was only
his second in dual-meet competition
in his college career. Lewis felt that
Rosen was the best playcrthat Feld-
man has faced. Feldman‘s onlyother
defeat came last year to Colgatc's
Rich Finn.

The Danes also lost the remaining

live singles matches and sit 'tfiree "

doubles matches. Ducytyo Sondler's
absence; ft‘ejldm‘im‘ with Mike
Fertlg to play number two doubles
while Mott Reich ream With Andy
Antoszyk to play' third “doubles.
Both lost in three-set matches. '

Last year. Albany defeated U. of

Mass. 6-3. but this year‘s team is
different. according to Lewis.
“They're a new team this year and
are a ' lot stronger." he said.

This afternoon. the Danes take on
Union College with all matches to be
held on the lndian Quad courts
beginning at 3 pm. The contest will
feature Paul Feldman and Larry
Linnet. a local star. in the number
one match. All spectators are
welcome.

AMIA completed its wintersports

The initial game pittedthe league I
basketball all-stars vs. the league ll
all-stars. League i] opened up an
early Iti-4 lead but leagucl gradually
whittled that away and finally
emerged with a tense 48-44 victory.

Simon Stcckel and I’crcy Armstrong
each had it) points for the winners
and guard Mikc Rhett contributed
valuable late-game points.

But it was Ray (jay who stole the
show for league 1 as he scored i4
points. ten of them in the second

honors in the game.

shot crossed cithcr goul li ne. the final
score "-0. Mark Constantine and
Tom Herman each had promising
drives on net for the NHL. as did
Mike Ferrcntino and George
Baldwin for the WH L.

The closing contest of the night
saw the league Ill basketball till-stars
defeat the league IV all-stars 74-40.
The former broke out to an early 3|-
l3 lead but league IV scored ten
straight points and trailed by only a
scant eight one minute into the sc-
cond half. League Ill then reeled off
a torrid spree to put the game out of
reach.

Sieve Lani paced the losers with
14 points. it total matched by league
