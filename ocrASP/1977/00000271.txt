A SUN YA Residence Review

tltut ii Waterbury Hall student beim-
mediatcly removed from his dorm.
suspended for the fall semester. seek
professional psychological care and
be placed on probation for the dura~
tion oi one year. The Office of Stu-
dcnt Affairs is expected to act onthe
recommendation sometime next
week.

The student. Robert Guy Kupcr-
man. was arrested by University
Police last Friday and spent the
weekend injail after his bail was set
at SIUOO. Kupcrmun was charged
wnh criminal mischief for the break-
ing oi a window during a party at
Aldcn Hall.

the rcVicw board's chairman Scott
Kiilicki. tertncd Kuperman as tinin-
divtdiial with it "consistent pattern of
\‘lt)lclll acts“ and added that “incon-
stdering your tnllucncc on others in
residence. we are concerned that this
yzillitcnce could carry over and affect
students in the general University
setting."

Ktipcrmitti‘s petidiiig suspensions
stems lrotn what University Police
called. "it wave of destruction" tlittt
has occurred at Waterbury llitll dur-
ing the year.

"This whole thing stiirted with the

rcptitation of my litill. Waterbury se-
cond lloor northeast.“ said Kuper-
man. "We kind ofstartcd bringingin
souvineers and leaving them in the
hall; like trees. street sings and what
not. it kind of got to the point where
people Would come uptothetloorto
see what new things were there to-
day."

"Initially. myself and Jamey
Newhail were brought up in
September lor Judicial Board action
tor having something to do with tur-
ning over it vending machine. The
subsequent action was that no
judicial punishment would be in-
curred upon us but there would be a
letter stating that we had been
brough up belorcjudicitil board for
being involved in an accident. There
wasn‘t any damage. so no‘inoney was
involved."

According to Kuperman. there
were a series of minor incidents
towards the end of thct‘irst semester.
it was at a puny just before the
February vacation that serious trou-
ble began with Residence.

"i think there were three windows
broken in the lounge. So four of us
got notices that there would be
judicial botird action after we got
back from vacaction." said Kuper-
man. “It came out at this point—vit

by Thomas Me'rtello . . .
Dave Gold and ‘JimAi'onoll‘

scored victories yesterday in their_ '

bids to become SA President and
Vice President by edging out their
opponents in a runoff election.

Aronol'i‘ won the vice-presidential
race by a razor-close 26 votes over
Kathy Baron in one of the tightest
vice-presidential races in SA history.
Aronoff. who ran secondto Baron in
the regular elections last week. gar-
nercd l276 votes to baron‘s |250.

“I knew it would be very close."
said Aronoff. “Kathy worked very
hard. When I heard of the final
difference. I thought of all those peo-
ple who I stopped to ask to vote. it
goes to show you that every. vote
counts.“

The race between Aronol'f and
Baron was a tight one from the
beginning of the campaign. Both of
the candidates campaigned
vigorottsly right down to the waning
days of the run-off election. The
total amount of students voting for

"‘Putting it into perspective. we
really worked hard." said Baron. “l
‘caii‘t feel bad losing with twice as
many votes Steve DiMeo got when
he won last year for SA President."

“I‘m disappointed in general
because I believed I wasthc best can-
didate." Baron continued. “I don‘t
know Jim very well. but Dave's a
very good person. a very sincere
worker."

Gold detcated Paul .Feldmun.
Baron's running‘ mate. in the
presidential race by about 4 per cent
ol the vote. totalling |264 votes to

“I‘m numb.“ said Gold. “It‘s been
too many hours. too much time and
money. I cannot pick a person I
respect morethan Paul Feldman. I“
didn't run lor ofl'icc myself. I would
have worked for him."

Gold‘s strongest support came
lrom his home quad. Dutch. where
he racked in 363 votes. the highest
one-quad total of any candidate.

“I think the strength of my cum-
paign was the ability to get out and
reach the students." said Gold.

Paul Feldman could not be reach-
ed l'or comment.

The team of Gold and Aronoff is a
marriage of convenience. Aronoff
ran as an independant after his

Baron running as a ticket. it became
Gold and Aronol‘i‘. although they
never officially became running
mates. .

“l was ready to accept whoever
ran." said Aronol'f. “After Dan
dropped out. I knew i would be an
independant. I sat down and talked
with Paul and Dave about the role of
the vice-president. Dave was very
straight with me ttnd l respected
that.“

Both winners see the office of the
vice president pliiying a much
greater role next year than it did this
year.

“i think we‘re going to see a new
SA." said Aronoff. “We‘re going to
break a lot ol ties with the past.
We're all enthusiastic. I‘m very ex-
cited about next year.“

Weaknesses (‘ountered

“i realize my weaknesses." said
Gold. “Aronoll' will haveto deal with
certain issues I‘m not really versgd
With. I think he will be teaching me
more titan l‘ll be teaching him."

One of the immediate goals of
Aronoll when he takes office this
summer is to get student input into
the University Budget for l978-79.

“As far as I know. it‘s never been
done before." said Aronol'i'. "We
should have students talking with
people like Hartigan(Vice President
for Busineu and Finance) and see
where fat can be cut. We can see
where the students‘ interests are and
submit priorities of the students."

Gold termed one of his major
goals as “getting students involved in
every single aspect of this universi-
ty.“
