' Concept‘ofi Tenure Ex

(CPS) Tenure's strongest opponentr' '

ironically have infected new life into
the longstanding process which 95
per cent of American universities use

for selecting permanent professors '

from the ranks of the untenured.
In most cases. once tenure has
been attained. a faculty member's
position at a university is guaranteed
for life except in cases of flagrant
violations of existing school codes.
Backers of the system emphasize

that its greatest beneﬁt it that it en-
sures tenured faculty. shielded by
nearly impervious job security.

greater academic freedom in their

pursuit of knowledge.

The boosters. however, tend to ig-
nore the fact that the system can
result in a loss of academic and, in
deed. personal freedom for the un-
tenurcd. ' '

Students Protest Nuclear Plant

by Mark P. Greensteln

Some ten SUNYA students were
among the 2000 persons who
protested a proposed nuclear plant
at Seabrook. New Hampshire last
week. The protest was organized by
the Clamshcll Alliance. acoalition of
anti-nuclear groups
throughout the eastern seaboard.

At the demonstration, nearly [000
persons. none of
SUN YA students. were arrested and
charged with criminal
Many of .these l000 demonstrators
are being held at the National Ar-
mory in l'ortsmith for their refusal
to pay bail. Their refusal to pay
stems from the arrest of ISO people
at a smaller Clamshell Alliance
protest last year.

Peaceful Protest

Since theirs was a peaceful
demonstration. those who were
arrested are demanding that
everyone be freed on personal
recognizance without bail. “It's
costing New Hampshire almost $50.-

carcerated." said Ronald l‘anta. a

demonstration.

According to John David Portelli.
an Albany resident who participated
in the protest. “the demonstration
was well organized. Everyone work-
ed together. The National Uuardan-
nounced that if We would not leave

.the premises. we would be arrested.

During the actual arrests. they were
processed one by one." He added
that there were two groups of
demonstrators. consisting of those
inside the restricted area, who were

[keeping the peace. and those outside.

who aided those Within by bringing
in supplies.

When asked how be learned about
the Clamshill protest. l’ortelli
replied. “I subscribe to a lot of leftist
papers. and a lot ofthem mentioned
the Seabrook demonstration. The
papers said to write for information.
which I did."

ll the nuclear plant is constructed,
millions ol gallons ol sea water will
be pumped back into the southern
New Hampshire waters off the coast
ol Seabrook. "'lhe Witter would be

39 degrees warmer than its normal
temperature.- In addition to the
devastating impact that warm water
would have on sealife. it would
destroy a way ofli'fe for thousands of
fishermen who make their living in
that area." Fania added. '

that New York City's cit nt cent ex-

would increase revenues. according
to the 'l'ask force. by reducingthe
