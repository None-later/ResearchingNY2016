.  IyS'l‘EPHEN ALMASI
April 26th marked the 8er birthday of Rudolf Hess.
No doubt he spent the day absorbed in his favorite
activityi feeding the;birds. his only companions.

The former deputy to Hitler is the lone occupant of
Berlin's Spandau prison. which housed all those
sentenced to jail terms at the Nuremberg trials. The
othershave paid'their debt. Hess lives stubbornly on, a
tragic. ﬁnearly forgotten man. What is his story?

Rddplf Hess was born in 1894 in Egypt, where he
spent his first 14 years. He fought in the First World
War as a lieutenant, staying on in Germanythereafter.
While an economics student, Hess chanced to hear
Hitlerispeak at a rally, and was swept away by his
eloquence.

In.l920 he joined the infant Nazi Party. becoming
Hitler's secretary. In this capacity he collaborated on
Meir; Kampf. taking Hitler's dictation and smoothing
out its style. Though he rose to high ranks inthe Party.

By LINDA FRIED

Rising costs at the university have resulted in rumors
about a similar future for the Student Health Service.

Health Service Director Dr. Janet Hood said, “We
have been charging this year for a few services of a
personal nature. I have heard nothing tothe effect that
there would be charges for visits or anything morethan
we are charging now. That doesn‘t mean it‘s not in the
works.“

“The university has now made if officially legal to
charge students for certain things of a personal
nature.“ she added. citing ace bandages and allergy
shotsas examples. “When I ﬁrst came here everything
was perfectly free, including antibiotics."

Jo _n Hartigun, acting Vice President for
Marjagemcnt and Planning. said, "The only thing 1
kno" 'reflnitely is the State Legislature appropriated
2.2 llion dollars for a health service fee to be
determined by Albany State."

Dr. Hood said that she has been “pushing for a
student health fee. Students should be in on it. have a

his role remained that of a passive echo. . '

Hitler rewarded Hess‘ selfless loyalty in 1939 by
appointing him deputy Fuehrer, putting him second in
line of succession after Goering. When the war turned
Hitler‘s attention to foreign policy, Hess functioned as
Party leader.

This split widened with time; as Hess dutifully oiled
the domestic Party machinery, other men sought favor
with Hitler. Martin Bormann assumed Hess's old role
as faithful sidekick. gathering power to himself. Hess's
standing deteriorated. and the strain showed on him.

On May 10. I941. Hess commandeered a
Messerschmitt ME-l 10 and flew alone to Scotland. He
parachuted near the estate of a nobleman he had met in
diplomatic circles. Believing England would lose the
war. Hess offered to negotiate a peace. If she would
onlerave' Europe to Germany, England could keep her
Empire. Rather than meeting Churchill. Hess was
locked up as a prisoner of war.

Inﬂation Hits Health Service

say. They should have a big input."

She feels the amount should be decided on by both
administration and students. “M y concept of a student
health fee.“ Dr. Hood said, “would pick up where the
administration leaves off. It would stopthe nickel and
diming, N urses spendtoo much time making out bills."

Dr. Hood mentioned one worry. “Thus far, all loan
learn is that money may be collected in the name ofthe
Student Health Service. but this money may not revert
back to the advantage ofthe students in the name ofthe
Health Service;"

“I don‘t think people realize the volume we do."
continued Dr. Hood. “Last year we had 40,000
outpatients. We also have many contacts with faculty
and staff. Our in—patient figures: we have 528
admissions and 2690 patient—days." I

The Studc {it’dl‘lfealth Service has taken more than its
share of cuts. According to Dr. Hood. we have one of
the best health services in the country. Whether or not
students have Student Health Insurance has nothingto
do with their ability or right to use the facilities.

though. as to his declining health. He proved‘imable to
take the stand in his own defeniie. ‘ ‘ "-‘ '

The Nuremberg court feund Hess‘guilty on two
counts: conspiracy to commit other crimes listed in the
indictment. and crimes against peace. in View of his
mental condition. he was spared the death sentence.

Thus far. Hess has served thirty-one years at
Spandau. the last eleven in solitude. The same four
Allied countries which had partitioned Berlin continue
to rotate the guard over Hess. ' I  '

Albert Specr. once Hitler‘s architect and
Armaments Minister. is now the well-to-do author of
his own best-selling memoirs. He served 20 years with
Hess. and refuses to believe that the man is insane.

“He has always been odd. has spells pf hallucination.

Spccr. “l-less lives in a world of his own imagination.

Hitler never overcame his shock at Hess's apparent
