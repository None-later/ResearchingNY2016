A Handful of Beauty
Shakti. with John McLaughlin
Columbia 34372

Goodbye to Rock:
Hello to Raga

I By DANIEL PETERSON

if Handful of Beauty is a further
exploration of the austere heights that
shee'r speed ‘can achieve. in compositions
that force a mindless ecstasy on the
aspiring listener. John McLaughlin,
leaving behind the great Vishnu days. is
no longer intent on catering to a large
rockjazz audience. an audience which he
is largely responsible for creating.

Instead, he is alienating some of his
fans with compositions inﬂuenced hy‘the
:South Asian science of raga. Ragas are

written with the express purpose of

evoking subconscious symbols and state‘s
of consciousness ina balanced, elevating
framework The fusion of South Asian
symbology with Western forms is a
serious and difficult undertaking. a much
more esoteric task than fusing rock and
jazz. _ v ~
This sec‘ond ’ record by his group
“Shakti” is again' all acoustical. much
richer in texture than their ﬁrst. I think a
comparison with classical guitarists John

Williams and Julian Bream will show that '

McLaughlin is a speedier, cleaner and
more sensitive guitarist, perhaps because
he is closer to the creative process in the
music he performs.

L. Shankar is billed as one of India’s
greatest violinists. Though L. Shankar
plays as fast as McLaughlin, his approach
is very lyrical, and speed is more
associated with a heartfelt intensity than
an austere. trained mind.

The gutteral tabla music has deeply
impressed me with an exciting new
rhythmic outlook. deceptively colourless
at first. Zalar Hussain and T.H.
Vinayakram reportedly receive wild
aecluims at Shakti concerts, a fact
difficult to digest because they produce
the sounds most closely associated with
the South Asian tradition.

A Handful of Beauty, though esoteric,
austere, and mystic, is a very peaceful
record. It can bestow exultant energy,
expose unsettling desires, clear the mind
with its incredible speed. and perhaps,
though it is difficult to say, induce
epilepsy. '

On a high bastion at the west'end ofthe

beautiful temple of the Ionic order. It is
commonly called the temple of' Nike
Apteros or Wingless Victory. One of the
most famous works of Hellenistic art is
the Winged Victory of Samothrace. now
in the Louvre. Another famous Nike. that

of Paeonius. is in the museumcf.

Olympia. .

In Greek religion Nike was the symbol
or abstraction of victory in athletic and
other contests as well as In war. She
became.especia|ly popular after the
Persian Wars. The Athenians, :for
instance. dedicated a statue to' her at
Delphi alter the battle of Salamis. ln vase

paintings she is often depicted as‘
