‘BRAlNES GAME #8: Clever
Cadane

 

You‘ve heard of Cadans. Take
a word. spell it wrong. change the

'dcl'inition and give us a sentence

that uses the cadan as a pun. En-
trics that also end up making a
clever acronym (from the first
letters of each word in the
sentence) will be judged more
Invorubly. 11' the first two words
form an inhcrcnt contradiction.
and ii the contradiction is sur-
castic ol the ci..irc scntcncc‘s
meaning, then you have what is
called a “burnt cadun“. 11' the
acronan that is formed. when

. spcllcd buckwurds means “fart”

in any lorcign language. you
have what is called a “disgusting

" cudan“. Othcr‘vuriutlons will be

accepted. but are not likelyto be
winners.

. The long, hard battle over wh'oifwilliead StudentiA'ssociationnext r  ’

year is over. A record number of students voted, and the run-ofl'elec-‘

. "tions for the two topspots were very close. The new Central Council
.took 21 ballots to choose their chairman. Many dedicated people were“
involved in this year's election. If SA is to improve. it will need thehelp

of everyone who ran and lost. The smoke must clear as soon as possi

ago on to actually improve the lot of students on this campus.

te'rcst.
David Uold can set an earnest and serious tone in SA. Hecan inspire

."sludents to get involved. and can be. in a real sense. the "student‘s" SA

President. Uold can tap the talents of Vice President Jim Aronoff. and

:wO'rk-closely with new Central Council Chairman Michael Lissner.

.f»1;is'sner, like Uold has proven he can inspire students (he received an

unbelievable 289 write-in votes on Colonial Quad). but he must also in-
"spire Council. Lissner may have far more success than Ureg Lessne did.
this year. since the new Council is enthusiastic and not, at present. dis-
_.iuus'ip'ned.

' - -SA_ begins again with a blank page. This year. Council can get solid in-
‘ 1 lormation before they make decisions. The Presidentand the Vice Presi-
dentican trust each other. Petty concerns can be eliminated. so students
'can spend their time getting things done. Reforms in the internal
:‘procéd'ures. handling of the groups and communication among the

leaders can be instituted. The possible list of accomplishments for SA is

Nonly-limited by SA.

_' .Uold. Aronofl’ and Lissncr all have enemies. other students who quest
lion their motives. But ifthe student good is everyone's shared goal. now

"is the time to put away the personalities and the politics. They will have a

few months to prove themselves -they must be givcnachanccto do so.
