Sandler was a bit disappointed
with his defeat. "I played so well in
the first wet but I got off to a bad
start in the second." he said. Sandler
trailed 5-2 in the second set but then
won four ol the next five games to
force a tic-breaker. '

“I was trying hard to finish the
match here. I didn't want it to go
three sets." Sandlcr said. He was two
points away from victory. leading 3-
2 in the tic—breaker. but lost the next
three points. forcing the third set.

The final set was a dog-fight all the
way. The two players reached 5-5.
then Rice won the next two gamesto
give him the win. “I was disap-

pointed Iosing this match. This '

whole year We been having trouble
winning the close matches." Sandfer
said.

With the victory assured for
Albany. the doubles were played an-
der pro-set rules. Linett got some
revenge for his earlier loss as he
teamed with Rice to beat Feldman
and Sandfer tf-l. Albany won the
other two doubles matches. giving
them their 7-2 victory.

Yesterday. the Danes faced
Hartwick College and easily
defeated them 9-0 on the latter‘s
home courts.

Coach Lewis was pleased with the
team‘s performance and said every
one of his players did well.

Lewis indicated Denny had the
toughest match. beating Jim
Murphy 3-6. 6-I. 6-3. Murphy had a
good serve but Denny played very
well.

In the other singles matches. Fefd-
man beat Uary Squires 6—4. 6-2.
Sandler topped Scott McLean 6-3.
6-0. Reich beat Erik Bitiimereb-i. 6-
2. Ackerman beat Wenti Veder 6-2.

4-6. 0-3.

Sandler was especially pleased
with his win. “I played probablythe
best I have so f'arin the spring. I had
a lot of confidence out there and that
helped my game." he said.

The Danes” spring record now
stands at 4-3; Were" they are ll-J.
Tomorrow. the team closes out its
season with a home match against
