Mike Motta. head coach of the
Albany State lacrosse team called it
“the most disappointing Ions of the
season.“ He was referring to his
team‘s triple overtime loss tothe Un-
iversity of" Vermont. Wednesday at
Vermont.

Jay Kianka put the Danes on the
scoreboard first with a goalth four
minutes into the game. Vermont.
however. quickly took control ofthe
game and led 9-5 after the third
period.

Albany was not conceding the
game yet. They put on a great com-
eback. scoring six goals in the fourth
period. At the end of regulation
time. both teams had ll goals.

The teams now had to play two.
four minute overtime periods to
decide the victor. Terry lirady gave
Albany a l2-fl lead with a goal in
the first overtime. it looked like the
Danes were going to win their first
game out of the last four but with
three seconds to go in the second
overtime. Vermont scored. Down
two men. Albany was unublctoclear
the ball from their own end and Ver-
mont's Courtney Jenkins picked up
the loose ball and shot it past
Albany's Willie Draughon sending
the game into a third overtlme.

The third overtime is played as
sudden death. Whoever scores first is
the winner. With three minutes gone
in the period. Vermont's Jim Varga
grabbed the loose ball and flipped it
into the Albany goal. giving his team
the IJ-l2 decision.

Coach Motta wasn‘t pleased with
the team's defensive play. “Our
defense just wasn't together. Again
we had the same problems we had all
year.“ said Motta.

He indicated. however. that
Brady. Dan Goggin and Jay Kianka
all had fine offensive performances.
Kinnka won 70 percent of his
faceof'fs and had 25 groundballs.
Iirndy had five goals and two assists
to raise his team leadingscoring out-
put to 40 points. Last year he led the
team with 38 points.

Goggin had three goals. giving
him 23 on the year. He is now just
five goals short of breaking the
record of goals scored in one season
he set two years ago as a freshman.

‘I'hc Dunes. in dropping their
fourth straight game. lowered their
record to 3-7. Tomorrow. they face

home next week to close out the
season. Next Saturday. they meet

will be the biggest game ofthe year.

and the first set 6-2.

The beginning of the second set
looked like a carboncopy of'thc first.
Linett took a 3-0 lead and was play-
ing very well. “i thought I was going
to lose at this point. ljust wanted to
make it look respectable." said Feld-
man. He made it morethan respec-
table. Right then hc began hitting
much better and completely turned
the match around. He broke Linctt's
serve and then went on to win the
next five games and the set 6-3.

In the third set. Linett again won
the first game. Then with l-‘eldmun
serving. the Union coach complain-
ed that Feldman was foot faulting
and wanted a lincsjudge. This didn‘t
bother Feldman. who claimed his
serve got better ai'tertheincident. He
completely outplayed Linett and
won the match by a final score of 2-6.
6-3. 6-2.

The loss was disappointing for
Linett. “ For the first half of the match
I was playing very well. I felt I was
going to win. But then I started
rushing my shots. hoping to finish
the match quickly. But it didn‘t
work." said a dejected Linett.

Albany‘s head coach Robert
Lewis was pleased with Fcldman‘s
performance. “ Paul started off poor-
ly but then started coming to the net
after his first serve. It was II real good
performance by him.“

Fcldman's win clinched the team
victory for Albany us they had
already won four of the other five
singles matches. Dave Denny. Matt

Court. To Hear has... Challenge

by Iiryan Holzberg.

Vice Presidential candidate Kathy
Baron is challenging the legitimacy
of SA‘s runoff elections in SA
Supreme Court today.

Baron asked for a recount since
only 26 votes of some 2500 cost
separated her from declared winner
.Iim Aronoi‘f'. When the recount was
finished last night there were 48
fewer Aronoff‘ votes from Indian
Quad. ptttfing Huron ahead by 22
votes.

Election Commissioner Kelvin
Dowd refuses to invalidate the elec-
tion until the missing ballots are
found.

The official cottttt last week listed
397 people voting for vice-president
on Indian. The recount totalled 348

votes.

Since the count of presidential
ballots remains unchanged. the only
way for Aronoff' to arrive at his
.recount total of tits votes on Indian
Quad is to have had 48 "bullet"
ballots either misplaced or stolen
from last week‘s election. A bullet is
when a voter circles only one mime
on the ballot. leaving either the
presidential or vice-presidential sec-

'tion unfilled.

The ballots Wch grottped together
by candidate its they were counted
last week. Sign-up sheets for lndinn

SA Books To Be Audited;
Firm Retained For $5000

The accounting firm of Urbach.
Kuhn and Wcrlitt ltas been retained
by SA to conduct an audit of' their
accounts next year. according to SA
Controller Nolan Altman.

The move was made in order to
comply with SUNY Central
guidelines that state: "an annual
audit shall be pcrformcdlon all SA-
typc organizations] by an indepen-
dent accounting firm. 'l‘hc auditor‘s
report shall be mitdeavailabfe to the
student body.“

SA‘s last audit was in I974. and
was done by UAS‘s auditors. UAS
provides various ttccountingserviccs
to SA such as administering SA
payroll. but since UAS has no direct
control over SA and is therefore not
responsible for its finttnce policy. the
audit was given with a statement of
no opinion.

“There are four types of audits."
explained Altntnn. "The best is an
unqualified statemcnt of opinion.
| Ins means that the auditors have no
qllL'SlltHlS about ltow any monies
were spent. The second is a qualified
statement. if' they have questions
concerning the worth of varioth fix-

fixed assets."

“The third is no opinion and the
last is if disclaimer. Urbach. Kuhn
and Wcrfinc seem confident that
they will be able to issue a qualified
statement.“ said Altman.

The cost of'the audit will be $5000.
with the money having alreadykbcen.
allocated for the '77-'78 fiscal year.
According to Altman. the firm is the
largest in the state outside of New
York City and has had extensive ex-
perience with other non-profit
organizations.

Letter Beneﬁts

“The most important benefit from
the audit will be the accompanying
management letter.“ said Altman.
“This will include recommendations
front the firm of how to better our
finance policy."

The audit will not be concerned
with agency accounts held by such
groups as the Albany Student Press.
Tower East Cinema. and Telethon.

“I‘ve never been against an audit."
said Altman. “l was in favor of'one at
the beginning ol'thc year. and I still
um. I think the management letter

day. He established the task force in
February. the first assessment to be

“We wanted to see if Roscrtblum and

he said.

The recommendations "are
generally what we expected.“ said
Paul Kietzman. a member of the
Roscnblum and Leventhal firm. The
firm “joined in the assessment that if
new services were tried. it would be
better to have a shorter retainer

“We got the best qualified person in a short time." said Gold. who
wanted the new controller to be able to work with Altman duringthe
latter‘s first week on tltejob. “ We reached as many people as possible."

Three candidates were interviewed by a screening committee ttp~
pointed by Gold. Altman. Vice~ President elect Jim Aronoff' and new
Central Council Chairman Mike Lissncr were on that committee.
“Following a Friday meeting. it was decided to open thcjob to all."
said Lissncr. “It‘s usL'tllyjust It patronage job. but this was the first
time it was open for discussion." Posters were put up on the residence
quads for only one other student applied for the position.

“l'coplc knew it would be filled." said Hetcltkop. “It's not something
students jump into. There was a very drawn ottt selection process.“

One candidate. Steve Millcr. said although the committee‘s criteria
“wasn‘t thoroughly explained." and the process was “perhaps
rushed. . . it‘s a start for improvement."

Another candidate has complained. in a letter to the Albany Student

according to task force chairman

If the recommendations are im-

hold informational workshops on
