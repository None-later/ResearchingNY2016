for their dean‘s list and is es-
tablishing an additional President'sf
list to increase grade discrimination.

The move wait madeto establish
3.30 as a dean's list minimum and
3.60 for a new President's list whenit
was noted that 36 percent oI'Oswego
students make the dean‘s list each
year. ' - ‘
Lindy Syrcll of Student Affairs
said those students who are
motivated academically will rise to
the challenge of a higher index for
the dean‘s list. “A dean’s list should
honor and recognize individuals for
tlteir excellence and should also be a
challenge for their peer groups.” she
said.

Syrell voted in lavor ol'thc change
to a 3.10 index. only because the
dean‘s list sltould speak to ex-
cellence. “We‘re an academicinstitu—
tron responsible for honoring those
students who achieve academically."
she said. “I would like to see ntore
recognition lor honor students. cs-
pccially through the newspaper and
other media."

.lim Andrews. aitmior majoringin
business administration. is not in

'easié’r,‘ 3 but the’y'ﬁ:  It's just like

river ol‘the higher minimum index.

"‘ll‘ they raise the index. they're

basically, sayingythat courses are
the curve—they think it’s necessary
to have a set number ol‘ A‘s. In and
so forth." ' i _

Andrew said he will be discourag-
ed it‘ they raise the index but that he
would» not change his study habits. "I
always try to get good grades and ill
ntakc the dean‘s list that‘s great.” As
an alternative. Andrews would like
to see u President’s list at 3.60 and
the dean‘s list remaining at 3.0.
“Students today are "at a higher
caliber. so there‘s no reason whythey
should not be recogniled l‘ortheir el'-
forts.“

Karen Lu Roina. an English
major. does not see the basis for two
honor lists. “If there's goinglo be a
President‘s list. those students mak-
ing the dean‘s list at 3.30 won‘t be
known." she said. “ l'hose achieving
a 3.60 or higher need no certain
status."

Another junior. Kim Collins,
would like to see the dean‘s list at
3.50. "Other schools have set their
minimum inch at 150.“ she said.
“()swego is not really a competitive

‘the average ade'tit‘etillegestttdentll ‘

school. )We hate mi need 't'orftwo ~'
specilic lists.”_ , ‘ ~ '
Both LaRoina r and Collins :said

professors make changes in their
courses. v

Marie Daddino said a 3.30 inde
is a difﬁcult number rind that _.l.5
would be a better index for the

dean's list. "I would like to see the

minimum index at 3.50. but jumping
from 3.0 to 3.50 is a bigsteptn toke."'
Daddino thinks that the increasing
number of students on the dean's list
is due to the “easy courses“ taken by
students.

Whether the proposal to rct'isetlie
dean‘s list will be passed or not is
questionable. Syrell sees a definite
change by the beginning ot‘ the Fall
I977 semester. Wilbur. honmcr.
bclicies that there is not rational
solution to the problem as yet.

“Our primary responsibility is to
Iurthcr evaluate our goals and objec-
tives as relative to the needs oi'socie-
ty." Wilbur said. "We must learn

ho“ to improte according to

society's values."
