By NEIL KENDUCK

When his leather-encased fist landed
on the right sideof myf'ace I could feel the
force of his punch travel like an electric
current from his bicep to my puffy check.
My head snapped back violently. but the
impact was absorbed with little pain. The
dozen stinging blows which crunched my
face during the first two rounds had
effectively dcadened the skin.

And when the bell rang. indictttingtlie
eitd of the third and ti nzil round. I was not
savoring the thought ol'u hot shower and
a cold beer. Nor did I fall to my knees in
appreciation for my survival. or in
forgiveness for this foolhttrdy adventure.
The first thought emerging from my
scrambled brain was that my fingers.
unlike mitch else of my body. had escaped

‘1 damage so that I could immediatelytype

ottt my experience in the ring that
evening. ()nly George l’limpton could
appreciate such eccentricity.

Whttt drove me to enter myself itt last
winter’s Colonial Quad boxing
competition against a college football
player who terribly outweighed me and

I easily out-classed mc'.’ Restlessness. The

kind of restlessness which built up inside

, me as ajourntilist who had growntired of

writing as an observer. For once I wanted
to write from the point of view of an
active participant.

In the case of a boxing match. it would
not suffice to merely wit ncss :in exchange
of blows and observe the reactions of the
attending crowd. Writing from this sale
yet distant perspecth provided as much
‘\'i|lllt: and reward its taking a shtiqu \\II It
an umbrella. l’urtit'ipztttug III the boxing
competition assured tiie I would not be
writing from the uutstdc ltltllxlflglll. | tltlc
did I expect that nearly being punched
inside out would he tliepriceto pay for an
enhanced perception of the sport.

As for as urgztni/cd boxing was
concerned. I had itS much lighting
experience as Bob Hope iii the last
three American wars. With a Zfl-pound
adianttige. it body conditioned from
football and a coach who was a former
Golden (ilovc semi-finalist. my opponent
presented it formidable challenge. I had
always been athletic :itid had mode an
effort to stay in shape. llut a mean
backhand iii tennis and on abtltty to Ice
skate provided the \\llll few skills ohicli
would prme valuable in the ttug.

( otiression of Victory

1 had three weeks to condition lli_\\L'll
for the contest. Considering the
illl\ill s of my opponent. l litid In my
mtnd conceded his victory before I began
framing. My major tlthClHL‘ was to go
the distance three three-minute
rounds with some sort of respectability.
Aside from the discomlorl. getting
knocked ottt would be counter-
productive to my pt'tttccf. I named to
retain us much of the details of the fight as
possible.

In order to Slll'Vle‘ three rounds I
needed to build endurance into my legs
and burden my itppcr body. to IIltptttiL‘
my stamina and condition my legs I fill]

resounded through the stairwell. As I

Not to be outdoitc. I began throwing
combinations at the raised palms of one
of my trainers. the crisp sound of the
gloves hitting the flesh electrified the
crowd and scared the hell out of me. My
credibility with the crowd came undone
only when my trainers unknowineg
placed my head protector on backwards
with the ear flaps covering my eyes.

the first round consisted mostly of us
checking out each other‘s styles. Toward

I felt drained sitting lll my corner
before the start ‘of the final round. My
arms wore purple bruises from blocking
my opponent‘s punches. My gloves
anchored my arms to my sides. I fell
sutto'nted and hailed the crowd for
polluting my air supply. Smells of grass
and cigarette smoke mixed with the scent
of alcohol and "Charlie" perfume to form
a pungent aroma which intoxicated me.
