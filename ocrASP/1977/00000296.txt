Dear Duke:
This was written with someone we both know
it! mind. [The sex was chungedto protectthe
guilty and to include more 0! this species)
Here goes:
Ode‘ to a Knurd
The Knurd is one to be admired
The "why?" is sure to be inquired.
Sol will tell you what's interred
When one you know is called a Knurd:
A Knurd could care less what is meant
By three digits stgntlicant.
Using live is rnuclt too dirty w
Hu prelers to write down thirty.

"Only to millionths7 That's absurd!
“i use trilliontlts," says the Knurd.

Though his tool and ears be cruddy.
Rather than shower, the Knurd will study.
Very diligent A You may suggest —'—
But study a month bolero a test?
"My odor may resemble turd,

"But I'll have my 4.0," says the Knurd.

But alas, he cannot understand
Why no girl will hold hls hand.
But then again, he’s no big dater
He's gorng with his calculator.

"Sex ts true (or bus: and bird,
"But I must study!" sayi the Knurd.

So my lriends. do heed his plight.

Go Voutl Forgot your books at right!

For rt textbook over lun's preferred,
You allo may become a Knurd.

Naturally you are exempt tram the above,
Duke. Too bad I’m not. .

lots at love, Da Duchess
