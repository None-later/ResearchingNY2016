PadtﬂeHockeySeason

by Mlchasl‘Curwin

STU opened the I977 paddle
hockey season last Sunday with an
impressive 3-0 win over the
OLCAA'I'S. It was the Iirst paddle
hockey game ever played at'Albany

State. it sport that AMIA has recent-l

Iy introduced to this campus.

The scoring opened with Walter
Kurkela putting one by OLCAA'I‘
goalie Eric Cohen about midway
through the first half. the assists go-
ingto Marty Riccio and captain Bill
Matt. Minutes later Kurkcla upped
the lead to 2-0 with his second goal of
the half. the assist on this tally going
to Darrel Haynor.

The second half belonged to STB
goalie Mike Lot‘aro who kept the
CAATS from closing to within one
by Iirst stopping it wicked drive by
offenseman Dave Starling and later
deﬂecting a shot off the paddle of
rover Bruce Klein.

The third S'I'U marker was notch-
ed by Riccio from Kurkela and
Haynor. The leaders then protected
the comfortable margin for the
remainder ofthc contest. The most
sparkling play ot'the game came with

Number one star ot'the game went
to Kurkcla for his two goals and one
assist. Number two was awarded to
Riccio. and number three went to
OLCAA'I‘ det’cnseman Aaron Berg
who turned in a stalwart perfor-
miiiicc for the losers. (iotilic Lofaro
also got it third star.
