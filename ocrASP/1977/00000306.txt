Implementing
Operation Bootstrap

To the Editor:

We are writing as representatives of a numberol
Columbia Communities along the Hudson River
who are opposed to. our area being turned into a
power corridor through nuclear power plants and
the 765.000 volt power line.

We believe that the action taken by Governor
Carey to delay enforcement of the State En.
vironmentai Act for another year negates our
right to protect the area. in which we live— both as
to its scenic beauty and the ability of the environ-
ment to sustain healthy life.

We believe that the age of new technology we
should be entering into. which could lead to a high
degree of energy self-sufficiency and a higher rate
of employment for New York State. is being
deliberately held back by the power companies
and the Power Authority of the State of New York
because. _."they have vested interests in nuclear
plantsgﬁ'nd'high voltage transmission lines.

We still pon the Governor. and upon the people
of this  _‘.‘-to acquaint themselves and begin im-
mediately-to implement the proposals put forward
in “Operation Bootstrap". This study. prepared by
Daniel Haley. chairman of the 1975-76 Legislative
Commission on Energy Systems. can be gotten by
writing to your Assemblyman.

It points out that we can provide 25 per cent of
our energy needs by recycling wastes. The
building of recycling plants in the citrus where

large amounts of waste are produced (:un provide
both jobs and energy in areas where they if rc most
needed.
Energy plantations of quick growing poplan thitt
can be harvested in three years and Iurncd into

tion Corps. in addition to keeping cncrgy (loll-11's
within the state they can helpto takcjoblcssyouth
off of city streets. thus cutting down the on nu,- rule.
the need for more jails. etc. As the technology for
harvesting and transporting and converting this
fuel is developed further. local farmers can be en-
couraged to use their less productive norms in ex-
panding this form of fuel production.

Small streams which used to providc energy for
local mills can be brought back into the production
of water power.

Off-shore wind generating systems. and wrnd
systems tied in with already existing wutcr- power
Systems can produce another large proportion of
the energy need by the state.

JULY 7. I977

‘I Haven’

by Jill Haber

Dave Gold. newly elected Student
Association President. who exudes all
the optimism new officials are famous
for, is obviously dedicated to helping
students increase their political and
economic rights. He talked at length
about what plans are in progress this
summer and what he hopes to
accomplish during his term of office.
He gives the impression that even
though it is only July. Student
Association is in full swing. ("I
haven‘t been to a bar in a month")
Whether real change will occur or
whether cynicism will. eclipse the
optimism. only time will tell.‘ "

What do you see as your firstmajor
problem with the University?
Gold: I'd say the future of public
education in general. There's been a
movement. away from public
education. I guess the best way to
improve it is to strengthen SASU—no
matter what its internal problems. It‘s
a 350,000 State University system but
they know we don't vote. we don't
listen. We have to stop that.

What is SA 's biggest problem right
now?
Gold: it's like a paper tiger—there‘s
notenough grassroots support and the
faculty and administration don't take

.it seriously. Certain functions—like

budgeting—eclipse other functions.

When will the Vice Presidential
runoff election he held? Are you
considering backing a candidate?
Gold: The elections should be held the
second week in September. It's going
to be fun trying to «explain to the
Freshmen just exactly what
happened. Both candidates are well
qualified. I haven‘t decided whether
['11 back a particular candidate.
Kathy's prettier but Jim‘s a better
athlete so . . .

What do you hope to accomplish this
summer? What plans are already in
progress?

Gold: In the past, summer has been
used to get to know administrators.
This summer will be different. We've
already had an interest meeting for the
students who are staying here this
summer. There was a turnout of about
20 or 25. which is good. Some of the
things we want to do are reorganize
the space in the campus center and

reorganize the governing of the
campus center to include more student
say.

One of the things we‘re disousslngis
unionization of the students. The
reason for unionization is that
students are getting screwed on this
campus. We don't have adequate
academics, we don‘t have adequate
say in~decisions. even on entirely
student issues. SA can't effect these
things because' it serves an

according to the SA Constitution?
Gold: Central Council gave me the
right at their last meeting to appoint
an acting Vice President for the
summer. I'd say appointing Paul has
been ’my best decision so far.

How does the appointment of Mike
Hatchkop, who is a personal friend of
yours, as controller fit in with
bringing SA to ’ the majority of
students? '

Gold: I felt really bad that I couldn‘t

SA's biggest problem? Not enough

grassroots support.

and the faculty and

administration don't take it seriously.

 

administrative function. Students are
fighting students over a 'limited
amount of resources. People think of
SA as an empty shell—they think of it
as just a bunch of people interested in
being lawyers. A union would have
grassroots support and no
bureaucracy. We're studying the
unions at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst and
Genesoo. We want input into student
housing. Whoever heard of a contract
where there was no negotiation? We
want tenant's rights for on campus
students.

But isn’t a union a cop-out answerto
building a stronger SA?
Gold: No.1 don't think so. SA has to be
bureaucratic to fulfill its budgetary
duties. but the strength of a Union
would be in mass membership. Its sole
purpose would be to fight for students
rights and it's possibly a better
approach than Student Association.

But wouldn’t this weaken SA?
Gold: Yes it would. but what I‘m
striving for is not to make Student
Association more powerful but to
make students more powerful.
Hopefully. it will be implemented this
year by September or January. We
want it to be carefully thought out and
thoroughly planned.

I understand that you have
appointed Paul Feldman as interim
Vice President for the summer. ls this

respond to the allegations made in the
ASP. First of all. it was only rumored
that he said he would be controllerif I
were elected—he told me he never said
that. Also what the ASP didn’t
mention was that he was an assistant
to Nolan Altman. last year’s
controller. and he was Altman's
recommendation and the unanimous
choice of the search committee. I had
to make a decision whether to appni n‘
a friend to the post and I decided ‘ , ~
shouldn‘t stand in the way so I  .
would.

You made a statement that you

would like to get students "involved in
every single aspect of this
university". In light ofthat. howmuch
input will SA have into issues like the
university budget or the
recom'inendations made by the
Committee to Review the
Undergraduate Experience?
Gold: John Hartigan. Vice President
for Management and Planning has
promised he will explain the whole
budgeting process to us. One of the
things I see wrong is that SA spends
too much time on its own budget and
not enough time on the University
budget. I'm against distribution
requirements and we'll fight against
them. A union would help here.

How important do you see SASU
becoming to SUNYA?

Gold: There's always a need for a

‘ Been-ma Ban...- on.

student lobbying group. If studen
don't lobby for themselves. no one 91

is going to do it. Albany's contribut,
to the last session was introducing, . .

bill in support of the suspensionof ’
classes on religious holidays. But we "
haven‘t decided on this year's SASU'
contract yet.

You were accused of implementing
the Student Patrol for political
reasons last spring. How is it working
out? Has it been used by many
students?

Gold: We'Ve had contradictory reports I
on it. The official crime reports aren't .

in yet. The head of security thinks it‘s
a big success. The University has
included a $15,000 request for Student
Patrol in its budget. I see it as part of a
whole crime prevention campaign.
Educating students should be its
primary function. ‘

How about the Student Dwelling
Corporation which recently
purchased two houses on Hudson

-' A've.? Do you forsee its expansion in

the future?
Gold: I‘d like to see it becoming a
major landlord for student housiny.. ‘ 3

But it's illegal for more than threei
unrelated people tolivetogetherin the i
same house although many students
live in four or five bedroom
'"Iur'fments.
time: We have a committee on off-

..uipurs housing trying to overturn
til" unti-grouper law. About off-
carnpus‘living—l’d like to see an off-
campus college like the one they have
at Binghumton which offers courses
for credit in cooking. city politics. and
things like that.

What goals would you like your-
admirn‘stmtion to be rememberedfor‘ﬂ;
Gold: Greater services for students?-
and economic power. I‘d ’like to‘
increase communication. Most of all
though. increasing student power in
the university. I‘m living on campus
to be accessible. It's important not to
get into an ego hang-up. I feel very
funny when kids say they‘re honored
because the Student Association
President is eating lunch with them. i
want students to feel comfortable with
me. Some of the things I'm proposing
are going to be controversial. but no
matter what kind ofjob i do I still want
to remain friends with people.
