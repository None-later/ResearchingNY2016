by Dan Gaines

There will be no revolution in our lifestyles
because Governor Hugh Carey signed a pot reform
bill yesterday. Most data indicates that the mari-
juana smoking habits of New York's citizens will
change little on July 29. when the law takes effect.
More people may try pot. but the overall percen-
tage of users in the population is unlikely to in-
crease much and cculdkas some Oregon studies
suggest. actually decrease.

Nor will there'be much change in the courts.
Though the penalties for sale and possession are
reduced. they are still unpleasant and smokers and
sellers will continue to take the precautions that
leave the overwhelming majority of them un-
touched by the law.

The significance of marijuana reform in New
York lies in the trend it is helping to set. New York
is the ninth state to decriminalize the possession
of small amounts of pot and to reduce the criminal
penalties for possessing larger amounts and sell-
ing it." New York joins Oregon. Alaska. Maine.
Colorado. California. Ohio. Minnesota and Mis-

sissippi. whose law becomes effective tomorrow.
South Dakota also passed a marijuana reform bill
last f all. but changed its mind and repealed it.

This is not the first year the Legislature has
considered marijuana reform. Governor ~Hugh
Carey introduced a. liberal bill in 1975. and even
former Governor Nelson Rockefeller suggested
removing marijuana from his tough drug laws

just before he resigned in 1973. I.

For the past three years the main obstacle to
decriminalization was assumed to be the
Republican-controlled State Senate. In January
when Sen. Douglas Barclay (R.C-Oewego). an
upstate conservative. indicated he would sponsor
a pot reform bill. there was a rush of optimism.

The Mall is charming. my friend proclaimed.
She looked at me shamefully. then clutched hold of
my arm. A ferocious squeeze made it clear that she
took the fellow wearing the "Stop the Clamshell
Alliance“ t-shirt to be an agent of the Labor Party.

Pity I can't enjoy it. I shouted. wrenching my
arm free: her paranoia. so in vogue amongst our
friends. was unmasked by a sideways glance
exposing the agent's familiar face. Surrounded by
a bevy of secretaries we sought safety along the
edge of the pool: silently we moved on. A platoon
of Capitol police adorned the plaza in search of the
latent mania endemic to the Crowd. Fortunately I
escaped.

The South Mall is despicable. which wouldn't'be

so bad if only one could delight in things
despicable. like the great old-timers. Nowadays
all one gets out of thatis a miserable sense of guilt.
The New York Public Interest Research Group.
with their penchant for ignoring the human
condition. has kicked off their “war on guilt" with
the filing of a suit. in the state Supreme Court.
challenging the constitutionality of the South
Mail's financing.

The South Mall is owned by Albany County.
which issued the bonds to build it. and is leased to
the state for a sum equal to the principal and
interest paid annually to the Mall bond holders.
The state originally acquired the property upon
which construction took place and transferred
title to the county in May of 1965. Sometime after
the turn of the century —— when the bonds are paid
off — ownership of the Mail will revert back to the
state.

The method used to finance the construction of
the South Mall. called a “lease” urohaee"
agreement. was authorized by the state in a series
of laws passed in the 60‘s. These laws allowed the
state to enter into contracts with cities and

Binghamton) said he would support eucli a. bill. but
that it wasn't an issue he would force on fellow
Republicans. . ‘ 

The New Law: ‘

Possession of up to 25 grams (about 7/3 oz.) in s- '
private place (home. car. peck". etc.) is a violation.
similar to a traffic fine. lt carries a fine up to .100. A
second offense in three years would bring up to $200.
a third. 8250 and/or 15 days in jail.

Between 25 grams and two ounces. or possession
of any amount in a public place (in open view) is s B-
misdemesnor and can bring up to 3 months in-isll
and/or a 05001lne. Two to eight ounces bringvup'to1
year in jail end/or $1,000 fine. Eight to 10 ounces
brings upto 4 years. 16 oz. to 1.0 pounds brings up to7
years. and over 10 lbs. brings up to 1 5 years in prison.

Gifts or sales are non decrimlnslized. though
penalties are substantially reduced. A gift up .to 2
grams or 1 cigarette can bring up to 3 months end/0r s
9500 line. Sale of upto 25 grams brings up to 1 year
and/ or $1 .000. Twenty-five grams to 4 oz. brings up
to 4 years, 4-18 oz. brings up to 7 years. and select
over 16 01. brings up to 15 years in prison.

The Old Law:

Possession of a quarter-ounce or less brought up to
1 year injail and/ or 81,000, between a quarter-ounce
and one ounce brought up to 7 years. and over one
ounce brought up to 15 years. All sales under the old
law brought up to 15 years in prison. '
