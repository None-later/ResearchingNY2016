Vi’ewilf'rom the Sidelines

_ 'l'othe satan-

Ah yes. the tennis season is here again. The
courts are filled with tennis players. and.
unfortunately. the sidelines are overi‘illed with
would-be tennis players. I would like-to speak in
behalf of the would-he's.

Last year. the university provided people to

. enforce the one-hour time limit on the courts. It is

my understanding that a lot of money was lost in
the process. and that it will not be continued. We
students are now left to our own recognizance.
Far too little of this “recognizance” exists. It is
'not uncommon to wait more than an hour for a

\ court. when. on the fencing near the entrance to the

courts. it plainly states. “Limit your play to one
hour if other players are waiting." After waiting
for an hour. 9n‘e is naturally reluctant to give up
one's hard-won prize: however, if no one played for
more than an hour. this problem would be all but
eliminated.

Obviously. this doesn't apply to everyone. but
the courts do belong to everyone. and those who
stay on them for two and three hours at a time are
taking away from my time —— and yours too.

Shall We Overcome?

To the Editor:

Have SUNYA students demanded their say in
this university? No. Have they filed petitions or
organized rallies in order to secure a voice in
University policies? No. What have SUNYA
students done? They have sat upon their asses and
let the administration crap on their heads. that‘s

.what.
4 That‘s right folks. in case you haven't noticed.
SUNYA students are apathetic — they open their
mouths only to yawn. raise their arms only to
stretch. and. like L'il Abner‘s Smoos. exist only to
serve those who would exploit them.

Well. Smoos. what have you to look forward to
next year? Maybe the administration will change
our name again for 90 grand. Maybe more liberal
arts professors will be fired for producing “on'
productive persons unfit for industry, Maybe more
parking lots will replace grassy fields. Maybe.
maybe. maybe.

Maybe students will get some sense and learn
that we pay the bills and therefore we should get to
make 'important decisions concerning our
education. Maybe students will learn that the only
Will! to get this say-so is to stand up and tight for
what we deserve. Maybe students will understand
that the Supreme Court has declared that young
people do not forfeit their rights and citizenship
therewith by enrolling in a university. No matter
what the despots who run this school say. we have
a constitutional right to protest. demonstrate, and
to hand out leaflets, even in the Campus Center.
The administration. and indeed the “student
association" have chained cur black community
by threatening the elimination of EOP funds
unless we behave and speak only when spoken to.
Remember that the EOPSA prohibilﬂ
demonstrations in its bylaws.

We. the students of this university. must unite
against administrative tyranny wherever it is
found. Maybe we can rally around the blacks. or
whoever has the balls to say what must be paid.
Just remember that when the time comes to fight
for our just place in this school. if you refuse to
come along and add your voice to ours. then you
have no justification whatsoever to complain.
When we move against them it’s all or nothing.

If you deem this letter suitable for publication.
which I doubt. please leave out my name. for i fear
that the pigs from security will give me a surprise
spanking or whatnot.
