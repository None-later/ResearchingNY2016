It's easy to adopt a distorted
view at academic Issues,
social concerns. ﬁnancial
matters and lite in general

here at SUNYA. The
overpowering imagery oi the
architecture combined with
the complex machinations
and intricate bureaucracies ot

a university olthis caliber and

size can sometimes strongly

iniluence its captive -— and
sometimes captivated —

audience. The pressures at

taking responsibiity tor your
own lite tor the lirst time,

including the endless
obligations ot academia, can
easily consume most of your
waking hours.

DON’T LET IT
HAPPEN
TO YOU.

Try to become an inlormed
audience. Insist on knowing
all the facts, on hearing all
sides ol an issue. Become
involved. Don't let lour years
go by without leaving the
imprint oi your teeth-marks
somewhere on this university.
Sometimes it bites back. but
don‘t be atraid to use your
voice -— and make damn sure
the rest of the world hears
you. Write lor the Albany
Student Press. The loudest
voice on campus. Remember.
communication is what
journalism is all about.

You’re only in college
a short time.

Wouldn’t it be a shame
if all you got was a degree?
