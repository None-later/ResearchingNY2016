JULY l4, I977

by Leslie Snyder

This past weekend at the South Mail.
the New York State Women’s
Conference approved the ERA.
abortion. and lesbian rights, among
other issues.

Although there was much
politicking by feminists and Right-to-
Lifers throughout the weekend. there
was surprising unanimity by the end.
Unfortunately. the large turnout led to
poor organization of the events.
marring this historic conference.

This conference was established by
a Congressional Act in 1975 to discuss
the status of women. propose changes
in laws to obtain equality. and elect 88
delegates for a National Convention in
Houston. State and national officials
will use these resolutions as the voice
of American women.

Of course there cannot be one voice.
and so various groups were present
this weekend to exercise their
influence: ethnic. political.
occupational. regional. and religious
factions. In other states. the Right-to-
Life party (anti-abortion) has had a
surprisingly strong organization at
these conferences. and has greatly
inﬂuenced the outcomes. Fearing the
same would happen in New York
State. feminists in over 28 diverse
organizations were able to join
together and form a coalition. They
presented one unified slate of

As an unemployed. unskilled.
female SUNYA graduate. I slowly
discovered that my chances of finding
a job were practically nil. This, of
course. is due to the fact that Social
Science is by no means a practical
field. and being female makes it twice
as difficult.

I therefore decided that even a
temporary job is better than none at
all. and ventured into Manpower, To
my surprise. within a few minutes I
received my first assignment. I was to
be a typist for the First New York State
Women‘s Meeting.

The meeting was to be held from
July 8-10 in the Empire State Plaza.
During the course of the weekend. 88
delegates were to be elected for the
First National Women's Conference in
Houston in November. Presentations
were also planned for the Governor
and Legislature. and eventually. the
President and Congress.

Larrived on Friday at 3:00. knowing
little about the scope and purpose of
this meeting. Not being familiar with
the Plaza. I was afraid of becoming
lost. but as I proceeded down the
Grand Concourse. I couldn’t help but
notice the mobs of women
surrounding the main meeting room. I
told a staff member at the door that I
was from Manpower. to which she
replied. “Womanpower.”

I said. "No Manpower."

S h c a gal n
“Womanpower.”

Seeing that I was getting nowhere. I
explained that I was a typist and she
eventually let me in. I asked several
women who seemed to be in charge
where I was to go. One by one. they
replied that they would find out. then
disappeared. No one seemed to know.

the resolutions. . i

The first battleground was the
workshops on Saturday. Each
workshop was allowed one primary
and one secondary resolution. chosen
democratically. Anyone rigistered at
the conference could attend and vote at
any workshop. in theory.
Unfortunately. registration —times
were not publicized - I. arrivad too
late. And at some of the more
controversial workshops. such as
abortion. the doors were looked after a
certain number of people had been
admitted.

Even so. the debates inside Were
heavy. Interestingly. the leaders of
Right-to-Life were male. But most
women at the conference did not want
men to be actively involved. and so
refused to listen to these men. As one
woman said, “They ‘were just booed
whenever they spoke. And the women»
with them didn't know ho '
what to say to help.“

Then. before I knew it, there were 50
people in my line. After about five
minutes of this. word came'down that
we would no longer be typing names.
we would just hand out information
packets and plastic cards to put the
name tags in. Once again. it sounded
simple. Little did I know of the horrors
ahead.

Within a few hours. the thousands of
packets that had been made up were
gone. Without these packets. there was
no way of knowing where any of the
events were or what time they were
taking place. Understandably. this
would upset a lot of people. but before
long. the mobs of women grew and
they became angrler and angrier.

We tried to explain that only 3000
women were expected. and that this
amount had already been more.than
tripled. We also informed them that
packets were being made up as
quickly as possible. but to no avail.
The screams continued.

Sunday was an organizational
disaster. People were waiting on line
to vote for up to seven hours. By

The thought of 'returning to this in

awake.’§ll night. and I tried to sort out
fin my mind exactly what was

happening at this meeting.

On the whole. I was disappointed in
both the women running the meeting.
and also. the women attending. It
seemed as if there was a lack of
planning. Of course. thousands of
unexpected women did show up. but
the organizers seemed unable to cope
with the change in events.

Several ideas on howto get out of
this bind occurred to me at the time].
The main problem was a complete
lack of information. We were never
told where meetings were being held
or where visiting women could go for
housing. Most of the staff members
were equally uninformed. There was
no central place to send these angry
women for information. or even a
place for them to complain about this
lack of information. Information
booths set up around the Plaza, and
perhaps a poster of all events and
times would have been a great help.

As for the Women who attended the

'I could be cynical and say that I
doubt the conference will have any
impact —- surely it did not with the
press. The final resolutions from
Houston are more likely to be used to
preserve the status-qua than effect
change. i.e. women are not concerned
about this so we won't bother dealing
with it. and we'll ignore‘the radical
issues. Yesterday Carter came out
against federal funding for abortions
~ which was approved of at the
Conference — because it is not up to
the government to help obtain
equality between the rich and the poor.
especially over a “moral” issue. .

I had a bad time at the conference— I
was sexually harrassed seven times
while walking through Washington
Park on my way to the mall. I arrived
too late to register. was closed out of
the abortion workshop. and had to
sneak into the plenary (because I
wasn‘t registered). But the conference
itself was unimportant compared to
what it decided about women and the
opportunity for unification it
provided. >

understanding. If they had been more
patient. or even volunteeredto help. as
many women did. the weekend would
have run much more smoothly. The
whole point of the meeting was to
bring women together to identify and
work to achieve common goals. This
was not the way. to do it.

The next day was calmer; my anger
began to dissipate. I was able to see
more of the exhibits and events taking
place around the Plaza. I realized that
I had only seen a misrepresentative
group of women. ‘ or perhaps.
misrepresentative behavior of these
women. 1 later talked to people who
had attended a lot of the events and
seen the entertainment and had come
away with a good feeling.

This meeting accomplished several

things. It drew more women than _

anyone thought would be interestedin
an event of this nature. It pointed out a
real desire for women to unite and
work together to better theirllves. Of
course. there are problems to be ironed
out. but altogether. from all I heard
and saw. there was a great deal ‘of
optimism. The encouragement was
hidden in the collages of womens‘
history informally read and
dramatized by volunteering actresses
of both stage and screen. in the music
of feminist songwriters. inthe moving
performances of the Failing Tree
Company and Suzannah Cher's one

pespite the heat of burning issues
and the discord of the uncooperative.
one could have some sense of
belonging within the crowd. Perhaps
