funds and the American people as a
whole. When deciding what research
proposal gets funded the, immediate
benefit or"psyoff" is often considered.
Consequently. much research in fields
such as education and health are goal
orrnission-oriented. A past president
of the American Educational
Research Association warns that this
type of approach to research funding
is myopic and may be deleterious to
the whole process of science.

Mdet critics of this shift from basic
to applied research have urged more
spending for basic research. In fact.
the urges have almost been pleas not
to cut back basic research funds. Some
critics argue 'that this redirection of
funds even imposes limits on the
freedom of inquiry in some cases. In
other words scientists are limited as to
what they can study by their research
funding. _ ‘

There is of course the other side of
the coin. Legislators and federal
agencies want an accounting of where
research money goes. Taxpayers also
have the right to know where these

funds go and how they will be
benefitted. , 
There may not always be direct
benefits from .-_basic research.
Scientific research can be visualised

mas'ai pyramid with basic research at

the bottom and’spplied research at the
top. With this in mind we can see wh at
Chancellor of . the University of
California at. San Diego Dr. W.D.
MeElroy mea'ntdn his presidential
address to the American Association
for the Advancement of Science. He

’ said that basic research must be seen

as an “investment in long-term
solutions to human problems.“ His
example was the electronics
revolution. If we look around us we
can see that the vast investments in
basic research of the 1950's and 60's
are now “paying off";

Dr. McElroy suggests that we make
too much of a dichotomy between basic
and applied research and that they are
really both situated on a continuum.
He also says that we need better
communication between the two and
that large scale. multidisciplinary
operations are needed to deal with
certain problems. The red-tape nnd
organization surrounding any
attempt at what Dr. McElroy suggests
may now be beyond the scope and
funds of the sciences and universities.

If these warnings are justified the
real decline may not show for muny
years. Now though. little is bei n g done
to study the problem.

' In this series of artfcles.theterm“hi
fi” 'or’ bi fidelity has 'been used
scrupulously where most would
simply say ‘fetereo" (as in "I want to
buy a hi fi system" versus "1 want to
buy a- stereo system"). Here's the
reason:

Stereo (stereophonic) is one mode of
hi fidelity reproduction. probably the
most popular one. There are others.
such as quadrophonic. monophonic.
and binaural. q

Stereophonic reproduction makes
use of two related sources or channels
of information. If you look at your baby
pictures (or the mirror). you will see
that .you. and most of God's other
creatures. have two ears. Like a
microphone. Your ear is a device which
converts the mechanical energy of
sound into electrical energy. Your
brain then translates this information
into a panorama or"‘image" of sound.

To say it another way. youdo not
"hear" sound either as being“left" or
"right." but as a full sphere of sound.
from which you can discern direction.
distance and other cues. Think about
the time you were riding in a car and
heard an ambulance siren. Not only
could you tell the direction the siren
was coming from. but also if it was
close or distant. if it was moving
toward or away from you. if it was
doing so quickly or slowly. et cetera.

With information from your two
care. your brain renders complicated
and accurate judgements about a
myriad of sensations.

Similarly. two separate stereo
channels do not (under good
circumstances) sound like Just left
and right. You hear an entire
psychoacoustic image. 50. a great
deal of subtlety and nuance can be
engineered into a stereo record and
captured through a stereo hi fidelity
system.

it can safely be said that the
loudspeaker is considered by many (if
not most) to be the most crucial
component in recreating this
panorama or image. Said another
way. of all the components of a stereo
system. the technology of loudspeaker
design is the least effective at
producing the desired effect.

Or. the loudspeaker is probably the
weakest link in the chain.

Loudspeakers are devices which
take electrical signals from the power
amp (or receiver or integrated amp)
and convert them back into acoustic
energy. which is after all. what the
entire mission is all about. They are
the opposite of microphones or cars.

Most loudupoltkers (in the price

range most people consider
affordable) use dynamic ddtrer‘s. They
use a permanent magnet.»'an
electromagnet. a cone. and a
suspension or surround.The

electromagnet converts the electricity” _
- into magnetic lines of force, which act

against the permanent magnet which
encases it. This force moves the voice
coil. which in turn moves the attached
speaker cone. The spyder and
surround act as a suspension to let

'speaker parts move'within a

prescribed limit. >

It is the movement of the speaker
cone which moves the air in a
prescribed manner.and this creates
sound. Think of it as a piston moving
back and forth at varying rates. This
movement corresponds (ideally) to
the frequency of the sound being
reproduced. For a 440 Hart: note (A-
440). the speaker must move back and
forth 440 times in one second. ‘

Your knowledge of physics should
remind you that in the audible
spectrum of frequencies
(approximately 20-20.000 Hertz).
wavelengths differ dramatically. Low
notes may have 32-foot wavelengths:
high notes have wavelengths
measured in inches. or fractions
thereof. Suffice it to say that one
loudspeaker cannot hope to be able to
reproduce all frequencies equally
well. Large speakers are needed to
move the large volumes of air that
base notes require. but are too
massive and not able to move quickly
enough to reproduce treble notes. For
these. smaller speakers are required.

It is for this reason that most
speakers systems have at least two
loudspeakers in each speaker cabinet.
the big speaker for base (the woofer).
the small speaker for treble (the
tweeter).

Even with this degree of
specialization. compromises must be
asked of these speakers (or drivers).
So. many manufacturers add more
drivers. often called midranges or
super tweeters.

These drivers must be contained in
some type of enclosure. The design of
the enclosure is critical in getting
optimum performance out of the
speakers. especially the woofer.
Different designers prefer different
enclosure types. such as ported
enclosures. folded horn enclosures.
infinite baffle enclosures. and sealed
enclosures which allow for acoustic
suspension of the drivers.

Finally. each of the drivers will
typically reproduce a wide range of
sounds. but ,only a portion of them
with any kind of proficiency. So. an
electronic component must be added
to delegate certain frequencies or
note to certain drivers. Such a device

suffer through other terms as well. I.
will not talk technically beyond these
terms for two reasons. The first is that
these provide abasio understanding of .
the way most loudspeakers work.
The 'second reason is the more
important one. The performance of
loudspeakers is a subjective thing.
Many attempts have been made to
measure the performance of speakers.
to be used as an indication of how they
sound. Sometimes this is successful.
mostly it is not. A salesperson or
manufacturer will often show you a
frequency response curve for a
particular speaker system. if the line
on the plot is flat (or nearly flat). this is
supposed to indicate that the

level. This is desireable for a
loudspeaker. but there are so many
opposing philosophies about how to
make such a measurement as to
render it of doubtful value.

The way tojudge the performance of
loudspeakers. more than any other
component. is to listen. Loudspeaker
specifications are only a crude
indication of how they perform. and as
you will discover for yourself. two
speakers with nearly the same
specifications may sound completely
different. ,

Go to a stereo store. Bring records
.with which you are familiar. Choose a.
receiver or integrated amp which

' costs about 40-45 per. cent of your

budget. Then listen to speakers which
cost around 3540 per cent of your
budget (the remaining 20-30 percent is
for a turntable and cartridge). Most
stores will encourage you to compare
loudspeakers; this is a method of
discovering gross differences in
loudspeakers. but little else. There is
no reference or standard to compare to.

Find a pair of speakers which
initially sound pleasant. Now. really
listen. Bass notes should sound well-
defined. undistorted. but not
necessarily overly prominent. High
notes. such as violins and cymbals.
should sound clear. close. and not
shrill or'muted. Vocals. probably the
most difficult thing for a loudspeaker

to reproduce. should above all sound -

play‘without distortion. For a low-
powered system .-(less~ expensive).
efficient loudspeakers are a must to
play at realistic levels. Use your ears.

Finally. after you have listened for
about an hour or two. go home. Then
come back and listen again. The way
_, nu feel plays a big part in your
perception of how things sound.

Do not be in ahurry to buy. The more
you listen. the more you discover the
speakers‘ strong and weak points. It
took me upwards of four years to
decide which loudspeakers to buy. 1
am not advocating that you be foolish
enough to make the choice of stereo
components a lifetime pursuit. I am
certain that well-informed and well-
considered judgements with regard to
the purchase of stereo components,
especially loudspeakers. will pay off
in long-term satisfaction with your
choice. -
