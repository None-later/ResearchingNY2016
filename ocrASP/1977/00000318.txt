Rolling Stone Magazine says one of
its reporters was attacked by a. swarm
of 50.000 ferocious African killer bees
while on assignment recently in
French Guiana.

Ed Zuckorman journeyed to South
America to report on the progress of
the killer bees which are expected to
reach the Southwestern US. in 1990.
The terocious insects have been
interbreeding with the local bee
population since escaping from a
laboratory in 1957.

Zuckerman was wearing protective
clothing when ambushed by the bees.
Describing the bee attack. he writes
“Bees were all over us. Bouncing

The Albany Urban Renewal Agency _

is sponsoring 'a program which
claims to provide saferxand more
attractive housing for low and

moderate income city dwellers. The'

Rehabilitation Assistance Program.
now in its third year of operation. is
receiving more than two million
dollars annually from the Federal
government in accordance with the
Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974. Existing or
new owners of property within the
four neighborhoods chosen for the
program may be eligible for a. direct
grant of one third to one half the cost of
rehabilitation.

AURA has approved more than 150
applications for rehabilitation
assistance. involving over 350
dwelling units. and dispensed almost
three quarters of a million dollars in
grant money. Area banks have
provided grant recipients with over
$1.5 million in mortgages and loans.
More than 50 buildings have been
rehabilitated and work on another 50
is being completed.

On the average the cost of
rehabilitation is approximately
$16.000. in this instance $3.000 in cash
and a $9.000 loan, as well as a. $4,000
grant. are needed to finance such an
undertaking. Low income people.
eligible for grants totaling one half the
cost of rehabilitation. have been
awarded such grants only 16 times.
less than 10 per cent of all approved
applications. Almost all of these have
gone to senior citizens.

The enforcement of national code
enforcement standards in all
buildings rehabilitated under the
program is admirable. This policy.
however. increases rehabilitation
costs by requiring recipients to have
such safety features as smoke
detectors installed in their building.

A thorough home improvement is a
big investment given today's
construction costs. For property
owners who have money or can
borrow it the grant acts as an
incentive: without it they might not be
able to improve the condition of their
building. The likelihood of a poor
person participating in the program is
small indeed.

RAP's bztsic aim is to rehabilitate
the city of Albany. not to redistribute
income. The effect of the program will
be to draw middle class people back
into the inner-city. In the process poor
people will be displaced, having been
"priced out" of this rennscent
neighborhood. It remains to be seen
where these people will go.

against our veils. tryingto getinto our
eyes. which is one of the favorite spots
Jor stinging." He adds that “A person
unprotected could have gotten 400 to
500 stings in, one minutes. which is
beyond the ability of the body to
tolerate. In other words. they would be
dead."

The Rolling Stone writer says the
bees are advancing towards the United
States at strata of 200 miles per year.

and cautions that Americans are

going to have to "Learn to live with
them."

He notes. incidentally, that the
nectar the“ bees produce is "The most
delicious I've ever tasted."
