NW 23, I977 ‘

    

After an appearance in the
University Gym on May 6. comedian

. Robert Klein was interviewed by ASP

reporter Richie Mermelstein and
WSUA's Paul Rosenthai. They were
joined by a dozen hard-core Klein fans
in a small conference room.

How did you like the audience

tonight?
Kleinzl appreciated them all the more
because they were under adverse
conditions. It was hot. but they were so
enthusiastic. The first 25 minutes
were a bitch. All I could do was make
jokes about the sound screw-ups and I
started to get a little restless; It all
turned out okay. ’

i have not been this exhausted in
about eight months. There was a
special kind of pressure going on. The
answer to the first question is yes.

is the college circuit annoying
because you run into these kinds of
problems?

Klein: Well. it happened at Carnegie
Hall. It happened with a sound
company that got. or rather. did not
get. six or seven thousand dollars.

Handicapped Try Out College Life

'[Promoter Roar Delsener wouldn't

pay them. It‘s really worthwhile when
you're going “to have performers-and
speakers in a large place like this. to
have something topsrate. It has to be

K' Wellzadvised. because they can tell

you to get something you don't need.

Is it annoying? The fact that people
who are not professional concert
promoters are handling things
sometimes makes things a little more
difficult. but professionals also'screw
up. For the most part. it's a beautiful

. way to make a living.

What makes a David Brenner or a
Steve Martin play Vegas and keeps
you on the college circuit?

Klein: Well, I’m neither of those men
for one thing. ' ‘ ’

I worked Vegas once. People pay $40
a. ticket ‘—— grown-upsi

As far as Brenner is concerned.
David has made it clear from the start
— I knew him as a producer at PBS -
that he wasn't making any kinds of
qualifications on \ his career. about
where he played or whether it would
be thoughtful or provocative material.
He's a commercial comedian in the
truest sense of the word.

years to the Riviera with Neil Sedaka.

they paid me an outrageous figure. I
am willing to forego $20.000aweek for

Is TV mommwardin‘g’warkfor-you? ‘
Klein: No.. it isn't. Because of the
obvious restrictions; They're way in
the dark ages. Our show was too way-
out for them. which is so ridiculous. If

I owe Lenny Bruce a debt

busted . . . I would have

Who are your favorite comedians
and who are your influences?
Klelnzbouis Pasteur. Isaac Newton —
First of all. I'm not that mad about
watching comedians.

My major influence when I started
ten years ago was Lenny Bruce.

I owe Lenny Bruce a debt of
gratitude in a very real way. All those
times he got busted...I would have
gotten busted a million times tonight.
I knew someone who was at the Gate of
Horn in Chicago the night he was
busted. He did some Catholicism bit.
The audience was hysterical; they
knew who Lenny was and they paid to
see him. These two plainclothesmen
went up on the stage, said. “You're
under arrest. Mr. Bruce." put him in
handcuffs and took him away. It was
scary.

I respect‘. of my peers...Richard
Pryor. George Carlin. Steve Martin.
Albert Brooks.

Steinberg -- he's not really a great
standup. He doesn‘t have that gift of
taking a. room. It doesn‘t surprise me
[that he wasn't well received at
SUNYA].



by Jill Haber
pro-college evaluation program for the
handicapped is now operating on State
Quad. SUNY Albany.

’l‘hc seven-week pilot program. is
designed to give severely disabled
persons a taste of college life before they

decide to on roll at SUNYA or any other college or
university.

The twenty participants. ranging in age from 17
to 37. arc all Capitol Area residents who have been
recommended for the program by their Office of
Vocational Rehabilitation counselors. Most are
taking it regular university offered course in the
mornings and then attending special courses
aimed to help an individual deal with university
structurc. deal with group lntcractimi. and obtain
good study skills. Wheelchair basketball games
are also held regularly. '

SUNY Albany was (chosen as the site for the
program bUCituEO it is more suitably equipped
than other schools for handicapped students. All
four poor counsciorsparo connected with SUNYA;
three are recent graduates and the fourth is
currently a graduate student here.

Participants in the program seem content with
the orientation they are experiencing. Beth Minor.
a 1976 graduate of Corinth High School who will be

attending SUNYA in the fall as a Social Welfare
major expressed satisfaction with the program.
"Everyone hero is on It one-to-one basis and there
is no formality. I think it's good for those who
aren‘t sure whether or not to go to college —
especially those who lltVG been out of school for
awhile or who are severely handicapped."

Karen Conrad. who has already completed a
semester at Marist College also expressed
approval of the program. S‘ic maintained. "1 think
it's it good program and should be allowed to run.
We a big shock to go from home to dorm directly.
Also. the attendant care is good. All in all. it's
working itself out.“ However. she suggested that
attcndcuts be given a mini courso so that they are
bottol‘ prepared. “or attendant Kelly l'lowlan
agreed. "We could have used moro practice."
Conrad addcd some practical suggestions to
i'ucllituto mobility for tho handicapped in
wheelchairs on campus. “Elevators could be
bigger with lower buttons. Doors could be wider.“
llowian continued. “And there should bc a ramp
going right into the fountain."

The program is sponsored by the office of .

Vocational Rehabilitation and the Cerebral Palsy
Cantor. Linda Field and Hope Premingor are its
directors. .
