n variably some college
students choose to live off-
campus; for those who leave
their parent’s homes to
attend SUNYA such a move
is a reflec-action. more
biologically than rationally inspired.
Though I can recall no instances of
love at first sight. many of the
students who live in the city learn.

For those off-campus students who
toil in obscurity or consume in
ignorance. SUNYA has developed a
narcotic—the Off Campus
Association. Funded by the Student
Association. the OCA has. roughly. an
$11.000 budget: it Works closely with
the Off Campus Housing Office. Both
are located in tho “off-campus" lounge
of the Campus Center which.
incidentally. is newly furnished and
carpeted. _

Despite the culture of paranoia
which ﬂourishes at SUNYA—so many
students here have developed a
sophisticated restraint. endearing. yet
cooly terrifying. which would suit
things well if college life even vaguely
resembled a James Bond movie—the
OCA steadfastly attempts to bringoff-
campus people together. The belief

though perfectly unpeculiar is
exposed as a’ patent absurdity when
one is unfortunate enough to
encounter such a situation.

' OCA expands most of its energy and
resourus towards an admirable end—
that is. helping students steer clear of
the difficulties which may arise when
one rents an apartment. ‘In the past the
OCA has tried to educate students.
leading to the publication of the
“survival Guide to Apartment
Living" which is still available at the
OCA office.

Recently OCA. in conjunction with
OCH, has taken a more active role in
dealing with the problems that beset
student apartment dwellers. Tonv Che
of United Tenants is training SIX
students in advocacy and landlord-
tenant law. The students. who are to
receive a $500-a-year stipend. Will
work out of the Off Campus Housing
Office. which may be open evenings
beginning in the fall; three students
are already at work. Though they (run

students they are certain to meet it felt

John Kennedy. the director of ()L'A.
has high hopes for the organization.
He clearly sees the possibility of
increased university involvement III

students will benefit from this. To 1 his
end John will "try to get Studenls tn
understand that OCA needs their
involvement if these goals are to m-
achieved."

CDTA: Pros And Cons

To the Editor:

The possible CDTA takeover of the
shuttle bus system has been discussed
at great length. and there are things to
be said for both sides of the drgument.
it is a complex issue and it is not easy
to balance the pros against the cons.
But all of these details are secondary
to the basic issue of good faith.

CDTA can offer the most appealing
package in the world. but will they
keep their commitment? Semi-public
agencies like CDTA have been known
to contract with semi-governmental
agencies like SUNYA with little
serious study of whether it is feasable
to provide the stated services for the
life of the contract. No one can really
be held accountable. So if it becomes
uneconomicai to keep the contract.
they simply appeal to the government
for either a rate increase or a decrease
in service.

CDTA is expected to run a $500,000
deficit in the coming year. The
packages they have offered would"
have provided less bus service at a
greater cost than SUNYA presently
incurs. Evidentlywur shuttle system
is economical. Now. CDTA is offering
a package which would seem to
provide more extensive service than
we have now. at less cost than we are
paying now. Even considering that the
Federal Government will match the
funds we pay CDTA. i have serious
doubts that CDTA can continue to

provide this service for the life of the.

contract. They could easily contpl-tln
that they are losing money and thnt ll
the contract is not modified. tltv
alternative would be ul’lSpcllkilMt'
indeed. those are the tactics they .m-
presently using to have the Slilll'
pressure SUNYA.

ii' the Administration succumbs in
this pressure I am afraid that
sometime in the future we will be litt't'll
with one of three cxpenstw
alternatives: renegotiating thw
contract before it expires: negotintim:
a new. more expensive contract whim
it does expire: or discontinuing Cl l'l .\
service after five years and
reassembling a SUNYA-run Hillllllt'
system. The last alternative would
certainly beexpensivc. Consequently
the second alternative of II
substantially more expenswt-
contract or radically reduced service
after five years would be extremely
likely; To put it bluntly. in five year-‘1
CDTA would have us over a barrel

The simple facts are that CDTA is Ill
danger of going bankrupt. 'l‘lw
proposed arrangement with SUNYA
could not conceivably reduce their
debt by more than ten per cent PUr
year. if it does not actually increase it.
Whether CDTA goes bankrupt or not,
the students who rely on shuttl"
service are probably sooner or later
going to suffer substantially from the
proposed package.

wishing a‘ mouthful of warm
beer around his teeth. Bruce
stared out the window at the
water rushing down Main
Street. Its current carried off
ice cream tops. sandwich

wrappers and empty cigarette packs. I

walked over and stood next to him.

_without saying a word.

The water streamed by us and on
down past the pizza place. past the old
diner and the archaic bank. past the
bait store. Finally. at the end of the
street.’ it emptied into the harbor
where anchored ships bobbed in the
choppy salt water.

“Ya know." said Bruce. “Northport
would make a great tourist town. It's a
standard seafarer‘s village. like
Mystic or Plymouth. Fun to visit. but a
real dull place to live.“ I nodded my
head in agreement.

Bru‘ce turned and looked about the
crowded tavern for Scotty. He wasn‘t
at the bar where we had left him. We
walked along the mahogony counter
lined with people looking at
themselves in the mirror.

Reaching the back of the room.l saw
Scotty standing near the pool table
chalking a cuestick. A lanky guy of
medium height was busy racking up
the balls. He looked young. yet his

taking care not to let too much of a
head build up. and set it before me on
the bar. I gave him a dollar bill. He
took it and walked over to the cash
register. Returning he slapped four
quarters down on the bar. Ted was a
good friend.

Four or five beers later. the four
quarters still in front ‘of me. a hand
grabbed my shoulder. “Later man. see
ya at work tomorrow." Bruce paused.
awaiting my reply.

“Sure enough." I said. “Tomorrow.”
He walked out of the bar.

Scotty came over for a refill.
Leaning up against the bar next to me
he put his glass down for Ted. "Some
guys don‘t know when to give
up." he whispered. “l'm

through his thin blonde hair. Bruce sat
_down at a table to watch the game. i

turned back towards the bar and .

motioned the bartender with my
empty glass. He walked in my
direction.

—“I'll have another beer. Ted.”
“Sure.” he answered. “What
the hell's Scott up to. gettin' his
ass kicked in pool?"

“Yeah. i suppose."

he shouted. "Get/em now or
you won't get ‘em at all."

i stood and walked to a table. After
picking up an armful of empty beer
mugs and pitchers. I returned to the
bar and set the glassware on the ﬂat
surface. Then i set out to retrieve
another batch. Ted took the glasses

sink to be washed.

Scotty finished beating
Blondie at pool. He picked
up a couple of glasses that

Scotty andl sat doyrn at the bar where

from the \pool “table and] propped
himself up on the bar. There were no

Ted poured two beers for Scotty and
me. “I'll' have another too." said
Blondie. sliding his body dov'Vn the bar
towards us. 4 ‘

"Sorry." Ted replied. “i already
made last call. l'm closed now."

“Don't give me that shit.” shouted
Blondie. His glassy eyes stared
angrily at Ted.’ "You just gave these;
two clowns a beer." r ‘

"They‘re my friends." replied Ted.
“And they helped me clean up. So why
don‘t yon just split." ,

We tried to ignoreBlondie. but he
was determined to make a pain in the
ass out of himself. "Why the hell are
you looking at me funny?“ he
screamed at Scotty.

Scotty turned to him. “l'm not
looking at you man. I've got better
things to do.“ ‘

“You‘re a real wise ass." Blondie
yelled. Scotty didn‘t budge. “Yeah.
you're a real wise bastard." He
reached over and slapped Scotty
across the face. Before any ' words
could be spoken. Scotty leaped up. He
cocked his right arm back and thex
drilled his fist into Biondie‘s face with
a sweeping round house punch. The
blow jerked Blondie's head back. His
body faltered momentarily. then he
fell to the floor knocking down a neat
row of bar stools that ’l‘ed had lined up
earlier. Scotty straddled hischest and
began planting lofts and rights on the
Blon'die‘s bleeding face.

"Scotty." 1 yelled as ’i‘ed scurried
over the bar. "Stop it." i ran over and
wrapped my arms around’Scotty from
behind. lmanagcd to pull him ol'i'of the
guy. though he squirmed. trying to
break my hold.

Meanwhile. ’i‘ed picked the guy up
by the seat of his pants and dragged
him towards the door. Propping the
door open with his foot. ’i‘ed heaved the
guy out across the sidewalk and into
Main Street where he fell flat on his
back. 'l‘ed shut and locked the door.

Scotty had calmed down and was
back at the bar finishing his beer. 1
stated] out the window. i watched the
guy pick himself up off of the white
concrete. His checks were streaked
with blood. his clothes sopping wet
from the stream of water flowing down
the street. To my amazement. he
staggered towards the door. ’l‘ryinr.
the knob. he found it locked. “i'll kit:
you." he screamed. pounding his fie".
against the glass. i looked over at Teri
and Scotty.

"He's got to be nuts." i said, shaking
my head in disbelief. "just plain nuts."

The door stayed locked. The guy
stayed outside. We drank beer for
another hour until he finally wont
away.

Scotty and 1 Walked outside into the
rain. Stopping to light a cigarette. I
gazed down the street towards the
harbor. "Some fuckin‘ tourist town." 1
muttered. laughing to myself. “Boring
as all hell." ~
