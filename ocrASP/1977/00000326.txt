J was, 1977

by Eric Osborne

’ " f you've been following the
series up until this point. you
have been introduced to all to
the comp‘onents which
comprise a basic stereo
V "system". They are: the
power amp (integrated amp or
receiver). the loudspeaker. the

turntable. and the cartridge.

Perhaps you were able to
understand more about the operation
and purpose of each of these
components.

Perhaps this would be an opportune
time to convince myself that 1 should
not pursue a career in writing.

Whatever the case. if you purchase
one of each of the components listed
above. you will be able to play records
in stereo. If you choose to buy a
receiver with which to power your set.
then you have FM stereo (and perhaps
AM non-fidelity) as additional music
and information sources.

Another source you may want to
consider: a tape recorder.

Today. 99.9!) per cent of all records
are recorded on magnetic tape. It is 11
hi fidelity mode of recording
(although recording directly onto disc
is thought by many to offer superior
quality). It follows for editing and
inserts. multitracking. selective
mixing. special effects. and a variety
of other benefits.

In other words. the tape recorder is a
creative tool. It is the medium for
audio storage and retrieval 'which
offers the greatest flexibility and
potential for innovation.

Your home tape recorder offers you‘
most of the some advantages a studio
machine offers the recording
engineer. Studios use reel-to-reel
format tape machines exclusively.
Consumer machines come in reel-to-
reel. cassette. 8-track. and elcassette

formats. ' '

With the reel-to-reel format the tape
is wound onto a. reel for the user to
thread through a machine and wind
onto another reel. Cassette and
elcaseette formats feature asmaller
thickness tape pro-wound onto both
supply and take-up reel. cohtained in a
case. and automatically threaded in
the machine. An 8-track1has no take up
reel. The tape operates in an endless
loop. with different portions of the
width of the tape utilized at different
times.

The difficulties encountered in 8-
track decks are usually speed
constancy and range of i. __ .,
response. It is difficult to make a
transport. utilizing the 8-track format
which is truly hi fidelity. For this
reason. the popularity of 8-track units
has diminished considerably. in favor
of the cassette.

The cassette is quite a success story.
Originally. it was not designed for
anything more than speech
reproduction. But the format was so
convenient and caught on so quickly.
that engineers did a seemingly
miraculous job in creating stereo
cassette machines with extended
frequency response.

So. what should you buy? It
depends. of course. on your needs. and
your budget. if you want to tape music
for background. or if you don't like
handling records. or if you want tape
in you car. boat or Learjet. then a
cassette format is probably your best
choice. Units range in price from
about $150 to about $1000. Here
are minimum specifications:
frequency response from 50 to 10.000
Hertz. plus or minus three db. signal to
noise ratio of at least 50 db without
Dolby. 55 db with the Dolby circuit in.
wow and flutter of not more than .2 per
cent weighted RMS. total harmonic
distortion of not more than two per
cent at zero record level.
