‘ ill recombinant DNA
techniques create genetic

monstrosities?
Scientists and
nonscientists throughout
the country have debated
the topic hotly in recent months. but
here at SUNYA the issue is academic.
as one project using these techniques

' is already underway and two more are

slated to begin upon completion of the
requisite facilities.

Dr. Joseph Mascarenhas of the
Biology department is using
recombinant techniques to aid him in

~ his study of nitrogen-fixing genes.

This study requires only a P1
(minimal) level of physical
containment under the guidelines
determined by the National Institute
of Health. as the ‘mating and
interchange between E. coli and
Azctobacter. the organisms being
studied. occurs frequently in nature.

“There‘s nothing I can do with them
that they haven't done already." said
Mascarenhas.

The P1 laboratory in use for these
experiments is a small room which
does not differ markedly in
appearance from other labs on the
quiet third floor of the Biology
building. Glassware of every size.
shape and description abounds. vying
for space on the crowded countertops
with delicate calibrators and cloudy
solutions. '

Two small refrigerators hold test
tubes of recombinant DNA material;
an ultraviolet light keeps instruments
sterile beneath a glass hood.

Precautions required to maintain a
P1 level of environmental control are
standard microbiological practices.
including such common-sense
notions as the prohibition of eating
and drinking in the laboratory and an
insect and rodent control program. as
well as daily decontamination of work
surfaces and ofliquid and solid wastes
containing recombinant DNA
materials.

In order to convert the existing lab
to a P1 facility. it was necessary only
to install Formica on the countertops.
to make them easier to clean.

The lab now in use goes beyond the
NIH guidelines in that it has its own
small autoclave for sterilization. as
well as negative airflow;
departmental policy requires
maximum stringency where the
guidelines are vague. Nonetheless.
Mascarenhas is convinced that there
is “no evidence of hazards at all" in his
experiments.

The two other projects using
recombinant DNA techniques will be
undertaken by Dr. Richard Zitomer
and Dr. David Holmes of the Biology
department as soon as the P2 (low)
level physical containment facility is
built in atiled corner room on the third
floor.

Estimates as to when construction'

will be completed range from the
beginning of September to the end of
October. contingent upon when
SUNYA finishes the refurbishing of
Mohawk Tower.

The P2 facility will be similar to the
P1 lab. but restrictions will be even
more stringent. NIH requirements
include the use of lab coats and
mechanical pipettes. and a safety

cabinet to minimize air contact with
experimental materials by ' such
devices as blenders and shaking
machines.  ' ‘

Additional safeguards imposed by
the SUNYA Biohazards Committee
include a large in-lab autoclave. a
negative air-pressure system.
complete decontamination of the
room. and special locks on the doors.

Ironically. the remodeling of the
second-floor bathrooms in the Biology
building necessary to reinstall the
glassware equipment there will be

ore complex and time consuming
t an the construction of the P2
laboratory

Zitomer will be studying gene
expression—the regulation of genetic
information so that each cell takes on
a different function—in the
cytochrome C and histone genes of
yeast. with the aid of recombinant
techniques.

He sees these studies as being the
basic kind of research in this area. and
emphasized that for him recombinant
DNA technology was a resource tool
that would serve as background for a
series of studies which he expects will

' last five to ten years.

"As these experiments progress.
recombinant DNA research will play
less and less of a role." Zitomer said.

Zitomer was alarmed at what he
termed “a repression of free inquiry"

' in theibanning of basic research. “I for
~ one think experiments on this scale

are perfectly safe.” he said.

“The attitude of scientists has
shifted from one of caution to one of‘
safety.” he said. citing an
endorsement by the American Society
from Microbiology of NIH guidelines.
which noted that "not one expert in
infectious diseases or one
microbiologist accustomed to
studying pathogenic organisms has
spoken out against recombinant DNA
research." ""’

Referring to the furor at S'UNYA on
this issue. Zitomer added. “I don't
think the response was in line with the
level of danger."

Holmes will be studying structural

organization and regulation of.

expression in the genes of sea urchins
and yeast. Recombinant DNA
research is a primary component of
this work. which Holmes had been
engaged in for three years at Cal Tech
prior to being hired by SUNYA last
year.

“If they didn't want me to do this
work they shouldn't have brought me
here.“ Holmes said bitterly. claiming
that his career is suffering as a result
of the lack of facilities and the delay in
building them. He has been doing
indirectly related biomedical research
while waiting for construction.

Holmes dismissed what he called

i DNA ReSearch: Monsters From: Mimes 4

“alarmist worries." ﬁle'th-

~research we're doing isftotall’yi

removed frcim science-fiction'§ 
genetic engineering. We have been

7 extremely cautious. There is even loci

of a biohazard than we though .".~‘

He said that many of the additional»
safeguards were unnecessary'andl‘a
result of “bending over backwards to
appease certain factions in the
department." ‘ g

It is interesting to note that much of
the work that Holmes and Zitomer will
be doing will actually require. under
NIH guidelines. only a minimal level
(P1) facility. as they will be working
largely with organisms which cannot
survive outside of a test tube. 4

Holmes and Zitomer will be doing
their research under grants that total
more than $380.000 over a span of three
years. with the greatest proportion of
this sum covering starting costs in the
first year.

Most of these grant funds are used to
pay wages. including the summer
salaries of the professors and the
salaries «of personnel such as lab
technicians. research assistants and
glass washers.

An assessed rate of 62.2 per cent of
the grants is plowed back into the
Research foundation for indirect
costs. including reimbursement of the
state for overhead. cost of

A Barer Bearable Hot Summer’s Day

by Richie Mermelstein

l was walking through the main
lobby of the Campus Centerafew days
ago. heading toward the stairs which
lead to the cafeteria. It was a hot day.
with a stinging bright sun beaming
outside. I was wandering without
direction. taking time out from a few
appointments I had that day. These
business meetings forced me to
drastically overdress considering the
sweltering heat outside.

Everyone walking by seemed intent
on spiting me. Shorts and sandals.
skirts and tee shirts. light blouses and
sleeveless pullpvers strolled by. I
imagine with people attached to them.
though in my condition it didn‘t seem
all that important what the people
looked like. They probably would
have had windblown hair flying
behind them had I bothered to glance
at their faces.

A pair of vivaciously short shorts
walked from the TV lounge toward the
vending machines. Atop the shorts
was a loose halter which I'd swear had
no straps attached to it. The only thing
keeping it from falling from its
peaceful resting place was my
everpresent bad luck.

She wasn't very tall. but the length
of her shorts gave a long appearance
to her wonderfully shaped legs. Her
virtually non-existent halter
accentuated a perfect figure. She
couldn't have been wearing less if she
was in a string bikini.

As she approached the candy
machine. I coincidentally had a
sudden urge to buy an orange drink
from the machine adjacent to here. The

 

That’s the-story of my
life — love goes out the
door when money comes
innuendo.

in “Monkey Business”

 

area cleared out; there wasjust me and
her and our two vending machines.

I fumbled through my pockets for a
quarter. hoping] wouldn'tfind one too
quickly. Staring at the machine. with
only 3 items to choose from. is a rather
blatant method of stalling. I glanced to
my left. and watched her deposit some
coins in the slot.

Her tiny face filled with puzzlement
as the machine refused to comply with
her push button demands. She struck
the coin return. and her money came
gushing down. Had either Lancelot of
Casanova been alive during the
Vending Machine Age. this certainly
would have been their moment to step
in. One of them screamed from inside
for me to do the same.

“You've got to have a magic touch to
get these machines to work." I said.“

She looked up. She hadn't known
that I was paying attention to her
plight. and was pleased to have

someone to share her troubles with.
When she looked at me. I saw even
more clearly how pretty she was.

“Do you?" '

It had only been a halfa second since
I said whatever I had said. but my
absorption in her quick glance made
me forget my profound statement.

"What?"

"Do you have a magic touch?"

There is a God! I thought to myself.
I'm staring at a stunning blonde with
almost no clothes on whose asking me
the most leading question I‘ve ever
heard. Half-dazed in utopian
happiness. 1 hesitated.

“You tell me." I said enveloping her
in my arms.

“Put down those nickels and we'll
find out." i blurted. walking off into
the sunset with her. ,

"Like Doug Henning and Houdini
rolled into one." I said. as she sunk
slowly into my caress.

"Do you?" she repeated.

I regained consciousness
reluctantly realizing that my bliss-
filled actions were only imaginary
retorts. I took the four nickels from
her. asked her which button to push.
waited as each coin clicked into
position. tapped the button for a Clark
bar. and handed it to her. I had let the
greatest straight line. the, perfect.
innuendo slide by. She graciously _
accepted the chocolate bar. I was
again aware of my sweaty pants and
out~of~season shirt. -

As she walked away. I think I saw
her microsborts and skimpy halter
give a slight smile. But it didn't
matter.
