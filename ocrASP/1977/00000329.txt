at too long again a gal
at very far away (Boston;
V _ pacifically). the owners * of
-;_Cine 1-8 ordered a new movie
- entitled ‘ Star Wars. Before
' I the movie began it‘s" run in
Albany. the owners—BBC
' _ Management. a Boston-based
corporation which also owns WAST
here—noticed that the strangest damn
thing happened when Star 2 Wars
premiered. in New York: hordes of
people lined the streets waiting to get
in.

V_ The success- surprised everyone.
There had been no advance build-up as
there was for Jews. none of the
excessive promotion as there was for
A Bridge Too Far. With only three
weeks left before the movie was
scheduled to open. the Cine 1-6
management realized that an
emergency course had to be set.

They ordered a second print. and
decided. for the first time in four years
to show one film at two of its six
theatres. Next, they doubled their
staff. hiring many employees only
days before the unveiling. They then
ordered extra concession and
promotional items. Perhaps the only
thing they didn't do was order a larger
cash box.

Star Wars began its seventh week at
Cine 1-6 yesterday. and has already
broken every one of the theatre‘s

’ records. including Iargestltotal gross.
“We‘ve had movies run for more than
‘ four months and not make this much."
said assistant manager; Bill
Van Alstyne. He cited Chinatown.
which ran‘for 24 weeks. as an example.

The major factors which have made
Star Wars so important to the theatres
have been indirect benefits. Cine l~6
manager Phil Garvey explained. The
concession revenues and the spillover
into the other theatres of people who
get turned away from Star Wars has
turned the Star Wars phenomenon into
a gold mine. '
 The ~Northway Mail’based theatre
doesn't have a popcorn popper. and
'orders anywhere from 25 to 100 four
and one half pound bags of popcorn
from Dolly's once a week. Last week.
‘Dolly's received three calls from the
theatre. "We ordered about 250 bags."
Garvey said. which amounts to more
than a half a ton. On Saturday. with
Bad News Bears Breaking Training in
Theatre One and Star Wars in Theatres
Two and Three. their all-time single-

r‘day concessions record was broken by
’25 per cent.

The spill-over factor has been
another pleasant surprise. Realizing
that people-who make the trip to the
theatre might settle for another

. product if Star Wars is sold out.
Garvey began revolving the other
starting times around it. “We try to
schedule a movie that isn't as popular
to start soon after Star Wars." he said.
Sometimes. he doesn't even allow for

those few extra minutes—“We can

' start a mavie at the same time as Star

Wars. and still see the effect. since it

often sells out an hour before it starts."

The‘mild success of The Island of Dr.

More'a‘u' Garvey attributes in part to

People who were shut out of the main

attraction.
“30 contributing to the overall

profit-picture are the promotional
gimmicks which have suddenly
sprouted far and wide. T-shirts.‘
programs. buttons and paperback
editions of George Lucas’ novel are
sold in the lobby of the theatre. "May-
the force be with you" t-shirts and
buttons were given away for publicity.
and have become collectors items due
to their limited quantity.

Laurie Wallace. who mans the Star
Wars stand. said people's reactions'to
the one "Force" t-shirt she managed to
keep for herself are astounding.

Garvey added that he knows
someone who received five dollars for
one of the "Force" buttons. The
commercial buttons available in the
lobby are plentiful—10.000 have been
ordered.

Presently. Star Wars posters are
outselling Farrah Fawoett Majors
posters by 5-1. One Hollywood
promoter claims that in_the end. Star
Wars memorabilia will outsell
Farrah. The true effe’ct. Garvey says.
will be noticed this Halloween. when
hundreds of pint-sized R2 units will
roam the streets.

And then there’is the movie itself.
Twentieth Century Fox didn't spend
nearly as much as other companies
have on either the making or the
selling of the film. Word of mouth.
critical acclaim. and Newsweek and
Time lead stories accounted for its
success. The movie industry is elated.
for the public made it a hit without a
hard promotional piishn

LETTERS

The. promoters of The Deep. for
instance. made extensive studies
examining the ideal marketing
procedures. and then saturated the
' public with massive ad campaigns.
They told us it was shit. economically
and artistically; and the public
proceeded to make it one.

“I don't understand how they‘re able
to advertise The Deep as being number
one." Garvey said. “Star Wars drew
more here during its fifth week than
The Deep drew during its first week at
Colonie Center. where it'was shown in
two theatres."

AUGUST 4, 1977

How long will the phenomenon last? "

Garvey suspects Cine 1-6 will be
showing Star Wars until
Th anksgiving. Assistant
manager Van Alstyne mentions
Christmas as a possibility.

No matter. In the nearby
galaxy of Boston Christmas
has long since arrived.

The CDTA—SUNYA Battle: Hold Everything

To the Editor:

Students are the ones who have to
use the bus service. It is only fair that
we should have a say in deciding
whether to keep the present buses or to .
give CDTA a contract to provide this
service. Not only are there a number of
matters that have not been
satisfactorily resolved regarding
CDTA‘s capability and willingness to
provide adequate bus service. the
summer is no time to go signing any
contract or to make any final
decisions either way on the matter.
The normal and reasonable procedure
would be for CDTA to submit a final
proposal and then for SUNYA to hold
full public hearings to listen to all the
affected parties before a decision is
made.

in the spring students showed
considerable concern over this issue.
Now the terms have changed
substantially. maybe for the worst. All
students should be thoroughly
informed of these terms prior to any
decision. If a contract is signed before
the fall semester. students will know
that they have been left out. They will
think that the Administration is
insensitive to student sentiment. and
afraid of student reaction. Perhaps
there are other reasons for making a
quick decision. But in my opinion. no
other factors could possibly outweigh
the need for simple fair play.

If the administration or CDTA is
afraid of adverse student reaction. it

would be convenient for them to push
for a contract during the intersession
from Aug. 6 until the fall term. when
the campus will be virtually empty.
This would indicate that they are not
only uninterested in student opinion.
but that they are positively afraid of it.

Students have in the past
demonstrated their strong concern for
adequate bus service. We have

-To the Editor:

As a student concerned with the
rising tide of immorality on this
campus. I find my stomach turning at
your callous depiction of deviant
sexual behavior via the cartoon that
appeared in ASPects today. I know
that this is the lamb of the free and the
home of the brave. but you should have
chopped that cartoon from that issue.
Come on. man. when wool this end?

it was necessary. We prefer

However. cooperation requires good

AudUSt”‘4’,-’i9‘7'7f '~ 7 

by Dan Gaines
unz was looking for a job. I
tried to help.

“How about in the
cabinet?" I asked. but she
just looked at the ceiling and

, sighed.

“I don't mean that kind of job." she
said. “I mean the kind where you can
get lots of money. Or at least come. The
world is tOugh these days. and jobs are
not a dime a dozen. A college degree
gets you nowhere.“

I looked out towards the fountains at
the center of campus. watching job
hunters planning their attacks. "I was
walking down Madison." I told Bunz.
“and saw job hunters chasing
employers down the street. They were
screaming for jobs but the employers
wouldn‘t listen. ‘We don‘t need anyone'
they would respond."

“You‘re worried about the job
hunters?" asked Bunz. "You shouldn’t
be. It‘s the sit-on-their-ass-and-fuck-it
types who deserve your sympathy.
They can't get a job because 'they
aren‘t looking.“

“They prefer fun to work." I
explained. “They deserve my
admiration. not my sympathy. Fun is
far more fun than work. by definition.”
I wondered how job hunters hunt
together as Bun‘z said something in
response. After all. what if they come
upon an opening? Two hunters cannot
enter the same interview without
competing.

“You're not listening to me."
observed Bunz. “Do you want to know
why you really should feel sorry for
the ass-sitters?"

“No. I guess we‘re finished with that.
How‘s your job hunting going?“

Bunz looked up at the ceiling again.
“Is that a roach?" she asked.

I looked up too. “Yes. it is. but they
don’t hire. Of course. they do make
jobs. For exterminators. Have you
considered killing bugs? It's probably
rewarding. How often can a mass
murderer enjoy the respect of an
honest profession?"

“I'm good at job hunting. not bug
hunting." Bunz said. “I don‘t enjoy
killing either." A

I disagreed. and said so. "You
spotted the roach. so you're qualified
to bug-hunt. And while you may not
enjoy killing. you can take it one

abstract level higher and enjoy
making a killing." I began
daydreaming about killing bugs. Vern
and I once burned a spider. but I'm not
sure that‘s enough experience for
exterminating companies. Also. if
they're paid by the bug. then three
minutes would be too long to kill one
spider. I once asked Vern how many
bugs exterminators kill an hour. but
he said he didn't give a damn.

"Gaines." That was Bunz‘s voice
again. "Gaines. what do you think us
job hunters should do?"

. “Extermination has real
possibilities that we have only
touched upon here." I said. "You could
exterminate job holders. But be
careful. because if you don‘t aim
carefully you may accidentally
exterminate the job. too."

“The kookies down the ball just
hired a real person." said Bunz. "And
someone clearly on drugs keeps
asking me to work for him. but
refusing to say what's involved."

"Would he pay well?" I was asking
in spite of the fact that Bunz seemed
not to even consider the drugee's offer.
After all. we sometimes assume that
it’s best not to get involved. but then
discover that working for a weirdo is
the answer to a job hunter's dream.

‘ "$400 a week. he said. But I don't
believe him."

“Why not?" ‘

“Because he doesn't have a
telephone. He never gives a number
because his office doesn't have a
telephone. I can't see someone willing
to pay $400 a week not having a
telephone.“

“Telephones are expensive these _

* days." I offered.

"Gaines." Another sigh. this one at
the wall.

“I‘m sorry. Are there roaches on thg,
wall there?"

Bunz looked directly into my eyes.
and changed the subject: “Why do we
have these conversations?"

This question upset me. so I found a
way out of it. “Well. I know why I have

these conversations and you probably

know why you have these
conversations. but to ask collectively
why we. together have these
conversations implies that we have
some mutual reasons.“

I had objected to the wording of the
question. which gave me more time to
think about it. Bunz was being
somewhat unfair to ask such a vague
question. She had many other options.
In fact. she followed with one ofthem:

“I'm a poor. unemployed. fearful
college graduate who lacks direction.
and you‘re discussing the philosophy
of lanugage. Where‘s your feeling?"

I assumed my feeling was in the
cabinet. near the job. but I didn't want
Bunz to know that. If she found my
feeling. then she would realize that I
don't carry it around with me. And if
she knew that. she'd know that other
people might occasionally carry my
feeling around. Like Rags. But Rags
only borrowed it once. and he caused
me a lot of pain. Rags. you see. figured

 

 

 

 

 

 

that my feeling might be useful when

talking to people who didn’t listen

carefully. “It works for you." he said.
But people could tell it wasn't his own
feeling. . L

“All right." Bunz prepared to
change the subject again. "What do
you want?"

I knew exactly what I wanted: "I
want to write something about the
evils of Anita Bryant and why people
come to universities." That was about
it.

\a“‘

evil?" Bunz saw people as
stable entities. and’ her rem’ g _
clearly sarcastic. Evil calla. ' be
learned. she would say. but must be
there already. V ‘ '
"Or convince yourself our society is
too efficient. It doesn't need as many
people as it has to serve thapeople it
has." ‘ ' ' ’
Bunz started playing with her keys.
"That isn't true. 'I kept reading in
college that technology increases
employment. except that it does

I Hunting for Reasons

to Not Hunt for A Job

he sun was moving over the

campus and the job hunting

day was half over. Bunz and I

started talking about our

friends who had given up

job-hunting—and taken up
grand larceny. “In a way. I
understand.“ said Bunz. "They're
smart college kids and no one will
give them jobs. They feel as if society
owes them something. What scares me
is that the more successful they are.
and the easier their justifications are.
the more they'll do it." .

I wondered whetherl was impressed
with their cleverness as crooks.
“Sometimes I feel that stealing is a
skill like any other. It's so embedded
in society. Everyone steals
something. Do you know someone
who is morally pure?“

Bunz thought about that one. “There
are people who might be pure. I can't
see some of these meek. paranoid
people I know doing anything wrong.
They're all afraid they'll be caught."

“But is it still wrong when it‘s
accepted?" I was about to give the
classic example of cheating on income
taxes. but I decided it was an overused
story. Instead I talked about how
Student Association officers receive
$1.000 for the summer regardless of
their need. That was a new topic.

“That's a new topic.“ said'Bunz.
"And it sounds less interesting. If
we' re goingto kill aday ofjob hunting.
we have to kill it right."

“Or exterminate it." I looked around
my body for something to talk about.
and asked Bunz if I should start
wearing a watch. “Time is an
important dimension." I said.

"How can you live without making a
contribution to something?" Bunz
wanted to be convinced that wasted
time wasn't morally wrong.

“We're back to job hunting." I
thought of ways to make a
contribution without working. “If you
were evil. Bunz. then if you didn‘t do
anything you would be making a
contribution. After all. you know the
saying ‘If you don't have something
nice to any. better not say it at all'. So if
you don‘t have something nice to
contribute. better not to work at all." I
looked to see if she was taking me
seriously.

"Are there Evelyn Wood Evil
courses for people who want to be

reduce the need for unskilled labor.
But that's not supposed to be me."
Bunz dropped the keys. and they fell
noisily to the floor. ,

"Why don't you just take your car
and- go somewhere?" I asked. since
she's always saying that she should do
it. ' '

“I don‘t mean it when I, say it. ‘ “

Gaines."

"So why doﬁyou say it? Just to
express you‘re desire to escape? It's
like sleeping or drugs."

Bunz had some more questions
about her last employer. so she
changed the subject. “Are there ants in
their pants?"

I understood what she meant. so I
explained about men's underwearthal
doesn't fit right. or is not made with
enough material. "Some people don‘t
worry about sticking their hands
down their pants in public." I said.

“But some people do." Bunz said.
“and that's a good way to turn those
people off."

“My underwear doesn't always fit.
but I try to be subtle about it." I said
"Recently. though. I've been trying to
get myself to adjust my underwear
whenever I need to. It shouldn't
matter. and anyone who judges me by
my underwear adjustments isn‘t
going to be someone I want to know
anyway."

“Talking about underwear. how‘s
the Fearsome Foursome?"

“Huh? What‘s the connection?"

“They all woar underwear."

"Be that as it may. Bunz. the
Foursome are looking for lodging.
House hunting. as opposed to job
hunting. There are similarities."

“They find a place?"

“Nope. Everytime they see
something they like. someone else
takes it first. It‘s the story of their
lives."

Bunz looked depressed. “They have
tough lives?" .

“The world ain't easy. Buns.
Whether it's job hunting. or the
philosophy of language. it's all pretty.
hard to follow. And it's hard to know
your place." ,

“What's your place. Gaines?"

I'm doing mybest to answerher
question. That‘s why I wrote. “this
story. After all. things keepchanging.
so places keep changing. My place is
to keep up with the changes.
