 to get everything out of a recording
that I put in.‘ .

What do I put in? Heurs and hours
of work, ﬁrst of all. Getting just the
right sound from every musician—
before I even start rolling tape.

And by the time I'm ﬁnished
recording the music, it’ll have

his ilﬂ our last talk.
At this point in time. two’
things should be happening:
You should have a general
idea of which stereo
components you are
considering purchasing.

And you should have your money
ready.

We have talked about the business of
listening to and' judging various
compohents of a stereo system.

If you have visited your
neighborhood hi fi shop. you have
already experienced the difficulties I
am about to enumerate.

Stereo shops are simply not set up to
let you. for example. compare one
cartridge with another. You must
compare one turntable with another;
the cartridges will not necessarily be
the same. neither will the amps or
receivers. Consider what this means
with regard to comparing integrated
amps or receivers; unless the source is
FM. you cannot genuinely say that
you have listened to two different
power units under the same
conditions.

There is a further complication in
comparisons: the switching unit.
This magical device supposedly lets
the shopper choose which speakers
and amps he wishes to compare. just
by dialing up different combinations.
Also. they usually have a volume
control to let loudspeakers of differing
efficiencies be compared at the same
subjective level.

While this is laudable (its music
which is louder tends to sound better).
it introduces many problems. The
most important is the fact that

padding or resistance between the
output stage of the amp and the
loudspeaker screws up the amp's
damping factor. which is critical to the
character of the bass sound. It is also
virtually impossible to set two
sources at an identical volume. and

even seemingly undetectable
differences can yield the false
perception of one itmp or pair of
loudspeakers sounding "better" than
the other.

This is a problem in comparing
loudspeakers us well. its is their
physical locution in the
demonstration room. Speaker
placement is critical to bass response.
and in some Circumstances, to the
general churnctcr of the speaker
sound

So. what do you do? First. l'd like to
suggest that buck-and-l‘orth. A-B
comparison of components is not
terribly useful. certainly not its useful
as the stereo store would want you to
believe. When you make such
comparisons. you undoubtedly hear
differences. but It is difficult to make
quztlttnllvu judgments on this basis.

to your chosen integrated amp or
receiver. Then. take the pair of
loudspeakers you think you like and
move them to a “front and center"
position in the listening room. Do not
use any switching device. The object
is to evaluate the system as an entity.
in and of itself.

Experiment with different speaker
locations. different orientations
(horizontal and vertical). rl‘ry different
speakers. different receivers. different
cartridges. But listen to each
combination for a longtime. and listen
to n wide variety of records. Carefully
evaluate the strengths and
weaknesses ofcnch combination; even
go so for as to make notes to yourself.
Then. to compensate for the
peculiarities of the show room. listen
to the some set up at different stereo
shops. and see if you hear the some

Said another way. there are 'list
prices for stereo components. but no
wise shopper pays much attention to
them. except to use them as a basis for
how much discount to ask for.

Most stereo stores (big shops and
chains. not the little corner. guys)
work on a mark-up of anywherefrom‘ '
85-50 per cent. depending upon the
brand. Get price quotes from different
places. and have the stores compete
with each other to get your business.
But keep in mind that different stores
offer different warrantee and return
policies; these are often more
important than a five or ten dollar
difference. Go with the store that-
offers you a low price and a liberal
wnrrantee and return policy.
