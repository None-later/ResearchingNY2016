by'l‘homas Martello

Several issues remain to be cleared
up before an initial recommendation
can be madethatthe Capital District
Transportation Authority be
granted the rights to take over
SUNYA‘s student shuttle service.

High onthe list of priorities before
an agreement can be reached are
ﬁndingjobs for all present SUNYA
bus drivers and the assurance from
CDTA'that SUNYA will be given
"equivalent or better bus service" to
that presently provided.

The SUNYA Bus Committee and
officials from CDTA have been
meeting through the summer in an
effort to draft provisions of a
proposed contract. aceordingto Bus

Committee Chairman Robert
Steirer.
"They (CDTA) have been

submitting proposals to us.“ said
Steirer. “As of our last meeting.they
still are not satisfying all of our
requirements, though the gap is
smaller.“

One key requirement is that the
state providejobs in the Albany area
for the SUNYA bus drivers who
would lose their jobs if CDTA is
granted the shuttle service. During
the summer the Civil Service
Employees‘ Association at SUNYA.
which represents the SUNYA bus

 

drivers, took the position that its
memebers would not take any jobs
with CDTA. Were the bus drivers to
accept positions with CDTA. they
would lose any fringe beneﬁts they
had accumulated while working for
the state.

“We are trying to make certain
that the drivers are placed in other
jobs." said Joseph Crook ofthe New
York State Division of the Budget.
“We will not be creatingjobs. but we
are attempting to place them in
suitiible and comparablcjobs. They
are guaranteed that by contract.“

The State Division of the Budget
has been involved in the negotiations
between SUNYA and CDTA. Since
SUNYA is a state university. any
potential agreement with CDTA has
to be approved by the DOB.

“Legally. we[SUNYA] can‘tenter
into a contract on our own." said
Steirer. “We have to work through
SUNY Central and the State.“

If CDTA is granted the rights to
run the shuttle. it would be paid
5325.000 for operating the service
and would receive the same amount
in matching federal funds. CDTA
reportedly needs the money because
of financial problems which havethe
company over $600000 in the red.

ﬁnancial burden from the State of

to bail out CDTA in the event of

financial difﬁculties. 1

“The pressure comes from the, "‘

state.“ said Steirer. “because
this additional [federal]
money that comes to CDTA will

reduce CDTA‘s request forsubsidies‘

from the state."

“The DOB first got interested
because this would save the state
money.“ said DOB Chief Budget
Examiner Patti Veillette.

According to Crook. if CDTA
were to incur insoluble ﬁnancial
difficulties. the state would have to
bail them out.

“They would immediater come to
the state." said Crook. “Usually
that's the way. I guess what
happened with the MTA
[Manhattan Transit Authority] is a
classic example."

The question as to what
constitutes "equivalent or better“
bus service is another negotiating
factor between SU NYA and CDTA.

“We want them to meet our
schedule. not theirs." said Steirer.
“So far they have not met our
expectations.“

Steircr said that a meeting was
held on Aug. 22 with CDTA where

made public its recommendations in

favor of greater undergraduate
degree structure.
SCR U E‘s Final Report.

to former SUNYA President Fields

University Aug. l. outlines the
following proposal: “Each student
must earn at least nine credits in each
of the two colleges outside of the
college of his/her major. These
credits may be chosen from among
specially developed ‘University
courses‘ or from other courses of
particular interest to the student."
in addition. the SCRUE report
makes specific recommendations in

 

  

three areas: curriculum. advisement
and writing. It advises the
