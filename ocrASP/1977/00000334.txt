Sixty-eight SUNYA students who
were unable to obtain housing this
semester are currently living at the
Country Sqttirc Motel. a small, one-
story motel situated on Western
Avenue about live miles west of the
upioirn campus.

this additional housing became
necessaiy when it was discovered
that the Hotel Wellington could not
sufficiently meet overﬂow housing
demands. Director of Residences
John Welty said.

According to Welty. the Housing
Department had previously planned
to place the overllow students at
Birch Hill. an Episcopal religious
school. This plan fell through. he
said. when he discovered that there
would be at least a month-long wait

involved in getting a building permit
to rennovatc the classrooms into
dorms.

John Taphorn. a student living at
the motel. said he generally enjoys
living at the Country Squire. The
main problem. he said. is the
transportation inconvenience.
'I‘ransportation is provided by the
motel through a van that runs only
six times each day. atid costs $|5 a
month for those students who want
the service. Due to the high cost.
tnaay students choose to carpool he
said.

Currently, sixty eight students are
living at the County Squire. The
motel has l0 single rooms, for which
it charges $425 per semester. and 30
double rooms. which cost students
5360 per sem when

Five Quad members work in their new olllce ln Delancey. The
volunteer service expects its new ambulance next month.

Western Ave. Motel  

The facilities at the Country
Squire include a volleyball court. a
bar, and an outdoorswlmming pool.

The motel also has some meal
facilities in which items such as hot
dogs, hamburgers and plant are
served. Most Squire students
indicated that they were on the
university mean plan because of the
lower cost.

Currently. only SUNYA students
are being housed at the motel; there
are not private guests. Steve Spring.
manager iind bartender ofthe motel,
conceded that the proﬁts made
under the SUNYA deal are “pretty
even“ with those that he could make
at a private motel. But he said he
enjoys the prospect of having an
assured income.
