, under'the direction of

O’She'at justrecently revised its
manual editing system by instituting
more controls over the paper flow.
However. the conversion‘delayed the
initiation of prbcessing. thus adding
to the backlog. . ‘

Another variable slowing the
paper flow was the high percentage
of errors on the application forms.
Last year. because of poor
application design and carelessness
of students ﬁlling out the form.
eighty per cent of the applications
were rejected by the computer. This
forced manual review of l90,000
applications. Despite substantial
revision of the application form.
forty-five per cent ofthe applications
received so far this year have been
rejected.

A backlog of between 4000 and
8000 awards pending from the I976-
77 academic year exists. causing still
more delays. Although the
corporations‘s computer system has
the capacity to process both year's
applications. the l97o-77 forms are
being reviewed case by case. This
procedures entails the heavy manual
process of making inquiries to

students and colleges. fiinhcr
slotting down the process.
With the additional funding

allocated to the corporation in the

processing rateis picking up now.
The question is 'by how much?‘ ".

5 Lefltovits’ explained.‘ that the

statistics do not account forthe fact

that CUNY A is screening and
keypunching its own applications by
special arrangement with the
corporation.

“HESC starts from scratch with
the applications from SU N Y and the
independent colleges. But this year.
CUNY did the lion‘s share ofits own
processing." said Lefkovits.

As of August 22. the corporation
has received over l03.000
keypunched applications from
CUNY. Lefkovits suggests a sifting
out of CUNY processing data will

‘provide a more accurate picture of

the corporation's in-house
production rate.
Further complicating a thorough

evaluation of the efforts to

"'restruCture' HESC is the lack of

available data due to last year's ‘.

New Quad Pathway Lights Slated

by Anita Unterweiser ‘

New walkway lights are being
installed along the pathways leading
from Colonial and Dutch Quads to
their respective parking lots for
"safety and convenience," according
to Physical Plant Director Frank
Kopf.
The lighting is not yet up, but the
electrical wiring and the pouring of
concrete bases are nearing
completion. The lights themselves
will be taken from an existing stock
of mercury lights at the university.
“We're still trying to conserve dollars
and energy." said Kopf.

Kopf detailed a pilot program

slated for better lighting of the
Colonial Quad parkinglot. Original
were to put more adequate
lighting around the edges of the
parking lot. but it was discovered
that visibility would be much
improved if the present lighting were
to be switched from mercury to high-

plans

pressure sodium lamps. utilizing
existing electrical winng. Some
students had expressed an “aesthetic
objection" to sodium lighting. but
Kopf felt that the savings in energy
offset the disadvantage of yellow
lights. .
The eventual goal is to switch all

campus lighting to high-pressure
sodium. The .sodium lamps give
more light while using only about
half the wattage used by llte presem
mercury lamps. consequently saving
money. Also. the new sodium ltlilips
tend to last longer than the mercury
according to Kopf. "

The lights. when completed. we
expected to remain on from sunset
until about 2:30 a.m. It is thougm
that the new lighting mil a.” a”
deterrent to crime. Kopl aim
expressed the hope that it would
"give students and facility a mon-
comfortablc feeling to knott that it...
lights are there.“

Toth a Spy: Soviets

MOSCOW (AP) . A Soviet
newspaper said today authorities
had grounds to try Los Angeles
Times correspondent Robert C.
Toth for espionage but held off as a
gesture of friendship to the United
States.

The Literary Gazette repeated
earlier accusations against Toth.
who was allowed to leave the
country June l7 after several days of
interrogation by the KGB security
police.

The newspaper said he had
worked as a spy for US. agencies,
had tried to subvert Soviet citizensto
become informers and had tried to

 

learn about
installations.
“Thus there was every ground for
detaining Toth and for his standing
trial.“ said the Gaz'ette, the
publication of the Soviet Writers'
Union. “However. guided by the
interests of U.S.-Soviet relations. the
investigating organs. . . onceagain
demonstrated good will and allowed
him to leave the Soviet Union."
Toth has denied the allegations.
The neWSpaper said Toth
admitted during interrogation that
he received classiﬁed information
from “all kinds of scum."
The reference was evidently to

secret Soviet

. Jewish. dissident Anatolyw.
' ,Shcharanslt'y, who‘ivas arrested in

March and subsequently reported to
be held under the capital charge of
treason. . .v

The newspaper said Shcharansky,
a frequent . news source and
translator for Toth and other
correspondents. “well knew the
liking of Mr. Toth for military-
reltited branches of science." Toth
has said the dissident was a source
for a story he wrote about Jews who
had worked in secret installations.

Toth was first held and questioned
after receiving a docuinent about
parapsychology from a Soviet
scientist.

The Russians thought they were
getting too little from detente to be
putting up with dissidents as they
were.“ Toth said.

  
    

NEW YORK (AP) When the
“Doonesbury” comic .strip took a
satiric slap at the New York Daily
News coverage of the Sori of Sam
murder case this week. the
newspaper was not amused.

A spokesman said it was decided
“it would not be in the best interest of
the News“ to run the strips for the
week. Instead. old panels that had
not appeared previously in the
morning newspaper were
substituted.

When they did not run in the
News. the afternoon New York Post
printed the first two current strips on
