ASHINGTOVN (AP) Better things

are store for Ham. an aging space
chimp who now knocks about his
narrow cageat the National 200
without even a glimpse of the
moon—to which he.helped blaze a
pathway in l96l.

, Zoorkeepers are planning larger
quarters and more recognition for
Harri. who l6 years ago last Jan. 3|
whooshed _l55 miles skyward aboard

’ a.Redstone rocket, pressed levers
when lights ﬂashed. and splashed in
the Atlantic and‘on front pages over
the world. _

Ham's transfer to the zoo in I963
made the Huntley-Brinkley report.
and the space agency was to say of
his. space feat: “It veriﬁed the
feasibility of manned space ﬂight
through operational tests of the
Mercury life-support system."

But then along came those
manned spuceﬂights. moon walks.
Iinkups in space. ajoint U.S.-Soviet
venture. “Star Wars“ and the
Voyager planetary explorations.
Hum soon became a Washington
has-been. \

" People don‘t ask him much." said
a zoo spokeswoman. ranking Ham
No. 5 in popularity behind such
Icsser-accomplis hed Chinese
pandas. Smokey Hear. live white
tigers and even the collection ofplain
monkeys.

When Ham turned 20 in .Iuly.
hardly anyone noticed.

But the loo has a belated birthday
promise for the lSO-poundcr from
the Cameroons who served his
adopted country in space and who is
looking forward to the 35—40-year
lile expectance lor chimps.

LamerQua ' era at Zoo

‘ Construction of anew great 

house. starting in October I978, will
' allow remodeling of the zoo building

that houses Him. the gorillas and'

the orangutangs. All or most of the
present structure then will be turned
over to Him. whose new quarters
will include: i

-—-A cage three times larger than
his present pad. He might have two
rubber tires to swing on instead of
one.

—The rocket he rode into space
and a photo exhibit depicting his
flight. This should lure visitors; the
National Air and Space Museum is
now the city‘s No. l tourist
attraction.

-——A bigger and better backyard
with a natural setting for a realistic
jungle gym complete with tree
branches.

IT'S THE MIND

Two Scientists at Stanford
Research Institute say they have
worked with a group of what they
call “normal” Volunteer subjects who
were not considered to have psychic -
powers. They say that after practice,
the volunteers'quickly came up to
the same level of psychicfunctioning
as so-called superstar psychics.

The two physicists. Harold
I’uthoffand Russell Targ. have been
conducting experiments on remote
viewing with such renowned
psychics as Uri Geller and Pat Price.

Puthoff and Targ said. after
successes with these psychics. that
they wanted to see what a normal
person would do. They found the
volunteer subjects. after a period of
time. were able to perform just as
well in remote viewing as Geller and
Price.

The two researchers say they have
also been scanning brainwaves. and
think they have detected brain waves
changes as information is being
received.

THE ANITA BLUES

A Canadian freelance song-writer
and musician has released an anti-
Anita Bryant record titled “Let's
Keep Her Away.“

Craig Stewart ofTorontosays any
of the royalties he earns from his
protest record will be shared with
homosexual rights organizations in
Miami who are attempting to
overturn the Bryant-supported
referendum that defeated gay rights
legislation in Dade County.

Stewart‘s single is recorded on the
small “Seatangle Productions“ label
in Ontario and is available outside
the province only by mail-order. He
says that he has established a special
trust at the Toronto Dominion Bank
to adtninister any royalties from
“Let‘s Keep Hcr Away.“

in ngoslavia.

K omum'st. the ofﬁcial organ of the
Yugoslav Communist Party. is out
with an angry denounciation of state
enterprises which have been turning
out American style'jeans. complete

with 'an_ American flag sown on

them.

The Publication warns
communist party members to stop
the local production of the jeans.
suggesting the craze is not merely a
fad. it is part of a plot. Said the
weekly: “It is obviousthat someone‘s
deliberate attempts to promote this
extremely politically tinted fashion

The communist weekly also
criticized Yugoslav stores for selling
bathing suits and'other apparel with
tiny American flags sown on them.
