The university begins the new academtc
Iyear under new leadership and with some
changes in its internal organization.
There no longer is a College of Arts and
Sciences. and the three divisions
previously existing within that college
havo themselves become colleges. Thus
we have now a College of Humanities and
Fine Arts, and the new college also has a
new dean. The new dean is John W.
Shumaker. previously at Ohio State
University. He holds a Ph.D. degree in
classics from the University of
Pennsylvania. Within a rather broad ﬁeld
of classics his academic speciality is
papyrology. What is papyrology?

Papyrology is the decipherment and
interpretation of writing on papyrus.
Papyrus was the normal writing material
of antiquity; it was made from the fibers
of the papyrus plant. which was the
heraldic plant of Lower Egypt and grew
abundantly in the marshes of the Nile
Delta. With some notable exceptions,
such as Herculaneum in Italy and Dura—
Europos in Mesopotamia; only Upper
Egypt has yielded significant finds of
ancient papyrus; this is so. of course.
because the exceedineg dry climate of
Upper Egypt is favorable to the survival
of materials which perish in areas of more
moisture. Some papyri have been found
in tombs and some have been extracted
from mummy wrappings. but most have

  -
 I No More Pencils, No More _ .
i Books: Anyone For Papyrus? 

been dug up in the rubbish heaps of the
ancinnt villages and towns of Upper
Egypt on the edge of the desert.

The papyri found in Egypt are
generally in Greek and document the
Hellenistic Roman. and Byzantine
periods of the country. approximately
1000 years from the fourth century B.C.
to the seventh century AD. Papyri are
classified as documentary or as literary,
and the former are far more common
than the latter. Documentary papryi
include private letters, legal documents
such as a marriage contract, and business
records. Of special interests are the libel/i,
certificates of compliance issued by
Roman officials when there were
persecutions of Christians. Among
literary papyri the most famous are the
poems of Bacchylides. Aristotle‘s
Constitution of A (hens. and the Dyskolos
of Menander.

A papyrus can be a complete text or a
wretched fragment of a few isolated
letters. Sometimes the importance of a
papyrus fragment is out of all proportion
to its size.

A papyrus may abruptly break off at the
top or bottom or at either side. it may
have holes in it, the ink may have faded.
and the handwriting may be illegible.
The decipherment of almost any papyrus
is therefore tedious work. From time to
time. however. there are exciting
discoveries which make it all worthwhile.
