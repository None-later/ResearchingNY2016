This year. through the efforts of
Mr. Dennis Elkin. Coordinator of
Intramural Athletics and Recreation
and Cindy Hoffman. Chairman of
the Committee on Coed Sports.
quantity as well as quality and
equality will be present as coed
sports becomes a part ofintra'murals
at Albany State.

Softball serves as a good example
of the new sports program. Not only
is it required to have five men and
five women on the diamond at all
times. but in addition they must be
alternated by sex in the field and at
the plate. If the first baseman is
female. the shortstop must be the
same. ()utfieldcrs. as well as battery-
inatcs. must be shuffled in the same
tiiaiincr. At hat. the lcadoff hitter
may be male or female. but the on-
deek circle must be occupied by a
player of opposite sex. and so on
down the order.

The AMIA-WIRA encourages
participation. cspccially from cued
dorms Ill the new leagues. But that's
not to say its just lor dorm teams.
because anyone can form a team and
everyone can join one.
