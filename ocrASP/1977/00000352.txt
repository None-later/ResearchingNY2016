Ford when he is healthy. which has

Corning Machine Wins Primary '

by Paul Renthll

Erastus Corning ll. Albany's
mayor since I94I. nearly fulﬁlled his
campaign prediction of a crushing
two-to—orie victory over Democratic
Primary challenger State Senator
Howard Nolan yesterday. Unofﬁcial
totals had Corning garnering close
to two thirds of the vote. winning
l6.310 to 9.295.

Nolan provided Corning‘s only
primary ﬁght in the incumbent's ten
races for the mayorality.

Corning continues as the nation‘s
longest serving mayor. despite
widespread predictions of a Nolan
victory. A recent Times- Union poll
had Nolan with nearly twice the
popularity of the mayor.

Corning, however. told an ASP
reporter Tuesday that he thought he
would rally 70 per cent of the vote.

Most ofthc city's 50.000 registered
voters are Democrats. About 60 per
cent of them went to the polls
yesterday. -

Corning greeted campaign
5 upporters at his storefront
headquarters with a reassured grin
and many handshakes and kisses. he
told reporters he had “no idea“ why
his victory came with such
magnitude.

From the moment early returns
started coming in. campaign
workers knew it would only be a
matter of time before the mayor
would arrive and Howard Nolan
would concede.

Nolan arrived at Corning‘s camp,
at first unnoticed. less than an hour
and a half after the polls closed. he
told his opponent. “You ran a very
fine campaign.“

Nolan immediately pledged his
support for Coming in the general
election. dispelling speculation that
he would choose to continue his
challenge on the Liberal ticket and
possibly even the Republican line.
He summed up. “Thepeopie wanted
Coming."

The Mayor bad. since the outset.
carried on a relatively subdued
campaign. always noting that the
race was “in the [Democratic]
family" and shouldn‘t become an
unnecessary fight. Last night. after
the results were in. Corning still kept
a tight lip in his conversatjons with
the press. He denied that the party
machine had been weakened by the
primary battle. 4

never admitting any doubt that

Corning would remain the mayor.
“You don't stop a good thing in the
middle." one worker said.

The Coming crowd. several
hundred strong by the time the
mayor arrived. gave many the
impression of being an
establishment organization. The
supporters were generallly over 40.
well-dressed. and conservative in
appearance.

Voting results were telephoned to
the headquarters. where they were
posted on large hand-drawn charts.
As each district of the city was
counted. cheers spread through the
room.

Mohawk Tower Housing Renovation Delayed

by .lill llaher

Plans to retlovatctlle remaining [3
floors of lndiarl Quad's Mohawk
lower Ior student housing will
probably be delayed. according to
Vice President for Business and
i‘lililllCL‘ John Harligan.

in June. the State Legislature
lulled to appropriate funds to
rellabllitatc the Draper campus.
which would provide office spaccf'or
acadetlttc departments displaced by
tile loss of Mohawk Tower. Former
SlJNYA President Emmett Fields
had indicated that Mohawk 'l'ower
would be completely renovated for
student housing by September. I978.

SA President Dave Gold was ltot
informed of the state legislature's
failure to appropriate funds for
rehabilitation of the downtoWn
campus until yesterday when he met
Vice President for UniVersity Affairs

Louis Welch and Dean for Student
Affairs Neil Brown.

“First,” said Gold.“l’residcnt
Fields gave SA a committlnent in the
spring of 1976 which was during the
cutbacks. that the tower would be
completed in I978 artd second. 1 trlet
with [Acting SUNYA President
Vitleetlt] 0‘l.eary over the summer
and lie said the dorms would be
opened on time. They wouldn't even
guarantee September I979. It's
illercdiblc to make students who are
coming here for the first time, who
are having enough troubles
adjusting, sleep in’lounges and R.A.
suiterooms. It makes me wonder
ltow much all administration
contmittmcnts are worth."

Because of the housing shortage.
70 students are living at the Courltry
Squire Motel about five miles from
tile uptown campus.

Welch said that the University
Budget Division and the
Construction Fund are milking
efforts to receive the appropriation
but that the decision depends on the
state‘s ability to float a build issue to
raise the money.

“i ltopc it happens tomorrow."
said Welch. but ttc said that he could
not estimate when the final decision
would be known.

the rehabilitation of the
downtown campus. a project that
would cost $800,000. would be dottc
in phases. the first one involving
Richardson and Draper Halls.
according to Plant Manager Frank
Kopf.

“Downtown has been up for
rehabilitation for a while.“ said
Kopf. “It's old. antiquated. The
project is essential for the Draper
campus."

Mayor Corning talks to reporters tut night totlowlng hie decisive

Nolan Concedes Decisive Defeat

an emotional voice. and was
unprepared and repetitive. Looking
out with hloodshot. teary eyes into
the crowd of supporters gatll'Tcd at
Albany‘s Quality ltln. Nolan said.
“The people of Albany have spoken
in record numbers.“

In the speech. Nolan was quick to
quash speculation that he would run
in the general election on the Liberal
Party line. “I have no intention of
campaigning for the office of Mayor
after tonight.“ he said.

When Nolan urged the crowd of
300 supporters and campaign
workers to support Mayor Corning
ill the November general election.
the crowd responded with shouts of
“No Way." The defeated candidate
speedily replied in favor of
Democratic unity. saying. “Corning
has won fairly and sq uarely.“

Nolan‘s campaign aides. who
early in the evening had been
speaking of “key wards" and the
importance ol'a heavy turnout. were
reduced to trying to explain what
had happened.

Harmon Schnurr. one of the
advertising men who helped to
design Nolan's campaign strategy.
felt that the candidate‘s emphasis on
the future was the proper strategy to
use.

“We couldn‘t insult people by
telling them they made a mistake
nine times in a row." Schnurr said.
The Nolan strategy was to ignore
Mayor Corning in campaign pitches

One of the tentative proposals for
relocation oftlte faculty in the rest of
the tower is to move the staff in the
Education buildittg downtown and
tlletl [0 move the Schools of Public
Affairs. Criminal Justice and Social
Welfare into the Education buildittg
according to housing director Jolttl
Welly.

the renovation of Mohawk
Tower has already lead to a
remodeling of parts of the
Administration and Business
Administration buildings to
aecomodate the academic
departments displaced.

Currently the second through
eight floors of Mohawk 'l'ower are
inllabltcd by students. The 148
students living in the tower are
mostly upperclassmen. according to
Mohawk dorm director Kathy

and instead concentrate on Nolan‘s
good qualities. "Previously."
Scltnurr explained. "all of the
opponents who took on ('orning
head oll got clobhered.“

Schnurr summed up with a shrug.
"Albany." be declared. "is a real
conservative city that isn‘t big on
change."

The crowd at Nolan headquarters
relaxed in the moments after the
polls closed. conversing loudly and
enjoying the drinks heirtg served at a
nearby bar. At 9:35. when Channel
Six flashed news that Mayor
Corning was leading by an almost
two to one margin. the conversation
became hushed and sprinkled with
soft curses. Later. when Channel Six
declared Corning‘s lead
"insurmountable." an immediate
feeling of resigned acceptance swept
through the room.

Nolan arrived to make his
concession speech at exactly ten pm.
He was greeted with a standing
ovation as he worked his way slowly
through the crowd. shaking hands
and forcing a smile. He began his
speech by thanking his supporters
and apologiring for the loss. Nolan
then congratulated Mayor Corning
on his victory.

In closing his speech. Nolan
reflected on the possible lasting
effects his candidacy will have for the
city in the near future. "Perhaps."
Nolan said. "we have given the
Mayor food for thought as far as
some ofthc problems this city faces.“

Then the loser was quickly
forgotten. Even as he made his
closing comments. television
newsmen began taping reports for
the ll o'clock news. His final words
to the press were almost drowned
ollt by conversation and the clanking
of beer bottles. Lukewarm and
uncnthusiastic applause was heard
as he departed to congratulate the
Mayor in person.
