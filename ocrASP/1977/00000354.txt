“I was amazed at the first day‘s
sales," he said. “i would have been
happy making about $300 or $400."

The co-op, located in the Campus

Center lounge next to the pinball

room. was granted a 54.000 budget

HEW Grant Funds New Course

by Corinne Bernstein
and John Moran

The Department of Health.
Education and Welfare (HEW) has
granted SUNYA $28,000to support
a program entitled “Cultural
Diversity and the Human
Condition: Continuity and Change
Around the World."

HEW gave SUNYA the grant “to
promote a program on-campus that
gives students an international
program without taking people
somewhere.“ according, to. Arnold
Foster. co-director of the program.

“The grant was started by an
informal faculty group that went to
the administration. and said they
must have an advisory committe on
international studies.“ said Director
Robert Garvin.

The first development to come out
of the grant is an interdisciplinary
course which hearsthc same name as
the program.

It is a two semester course and
covers six different cultures. Foster
said.

It took the advisory committee on
international studies six months to
get the Mayan grant for the
program, Garvin said.

"We had to show that the program
we proposed was compatible with
the values ofthe United States Ofﬁce
of Education(under HEW), andthat
it was wellthoughtthrough. It had to
look to the panels reviewing the
program as though it had
significance for other universities,"
Garvin said.

Garvin said he hopes the program
may he continued after the grants
huvc expired.

Garvin also said a senior level
course and mini-courses dealing
with contemporary issues between
cultures are being planned.

involved in the failure to understand

Fines to Be Enforced at Library

by Jeffrey Neuburger

A policy of stricter enforcement of
library fines has been adopted bythe
SUNYA main library. head of the
Circulation Department John Camp
said.

Fines for overdue books have not
been collected in the past. Camp
said. because the library‘s computer
systems were unable to print out
notifications of overdue books.

The library‘s computer program is
presently being reworked. Camp
said. because more and more books
have been kept out past their due
dates. The new system. which Camp

will be able to spot overdue books.

Fines for overdue books will be
raised from live to ten cents a day. he
said

Policy Change

Another major change of library
policy Camp said. involves books
which are recalled by other library
users who wish to borrow the same
book. If the book is not returned
within a designated period of time.
Camp said a fine of one dollar per
day is charged to the holder.
Previously. the maximum possible
charge was seven dollars. It has now

been raised to sixteen dollars. Camp
said.

Camp said the purpose of library
penalties is to encourage an equal
distribution of books in particular
demand. He cited studies which have
shown that 90 per cent ot'all library
users are afterthc same 40 percent of
the librarycoliection He also said the
library does not make any money
from lines. Director of Libraries
James Schmidt said all money from
SUNYA‘s library lines must bylaw
be deposited into the General
Income Fund of The State of New
York.
