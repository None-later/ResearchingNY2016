delicatessen will open in three weeks,
said UAS General Manager" E.
Norbert Zahm. The deli will ‘ be
selling cold cuts and cheeses, aswell
as individual sandwiches. ‘ M
. A campus delicatessen was ﬁrst
suggested in January by Zahm and
UAS Director of Cash Services Les
Hines. They said the idea was
prompted by the success of both the
small delicatessen which operated in
conjunction with the Rathskeller
this summer. and of the submarine
bar in the Campus Center snack bar.
The UAS Board of Directors liked
the idea and set aside a $25,000
appropriation for the project. said
Hines.

The dcli will be operated out of a
converted dishroom adjacent to the

  

Cri‘rnpus Centercsteteria. .  :
“It will be a little crowded," said
Zahm. He added he expects the deli

‘ to be a success.'as the co’ncept has

alWays been popular- with Albany
students. People like to see a
sandwich -made 'bei'ore them to

The New York style deli will
include a cold cut case. a sandwich-
