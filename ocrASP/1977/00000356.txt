A NEW HIGH
Two London residents. Amanda
Fielding and Joe Mellon. are
reponed by a Miami magazine to
have obtained permanent highs by

having holes drilled intotheir heads. '

The publication, Superstar
magazine. insists the story is true.
saying the’operation is known as
"trepanning." It is said to involve
drilling a rather large disc out ofthe
skull. and was used centuries ago to
relieve pressure on the brain and
allow more oxygen inside the skull.

Amanda Fielding is reported to
have told Women‘s Wear Dailythat
she now enjoys ll "permanent high."
Mellon is quoted in the same article
as stating that the hole in his head
gives him — in his words — “a
permanent level of childhood in
terms of consciousness.“

The article does not explain how
either of the two subjects with holes
in their heads manage to keep
unwanted debris away from their
brains.

SIT-IN PLANNED

Leaders of an anti-nuclear power
group have announced plans for a
massive sit-in at the site of an
operating nuclear plant near
Portland. Oregon.

The group. calling itself “The
Trojan Decommissioning Alliance“.
says that volunteers are currently
being trained for the occupation of
the Trojan nuclear power station.
located 60 miles west of Portland.
The occupation will take place the
day after Thanksgiving. on
November 25th.

Eighty-six demonstrators were
arrested during a similar sit—in at the
Trojan plant last month. According
to alliance organizers, the August

6th occupation of the Trojan site
marked the first time that
demonstrators had entered and
occupied the site of an'operating
nuclear plant in the United States.
Other anti-nuclear protests. the
Alliance says. including large sit-ins
in New Hampshire and California.
have occurred at proposed sites. or
at plants which are not yet operating.
The Alliance says more than 86
protesters will participate in the
November 25th action. adding that
volunteers are being trained in "non-
violent sit-in techniques." The 86
who were arrested last month have
all pleaded “not guilty" to criminal
trespassing charges and are
scheduled to stand trial in October.

SEAWEED POWER

The General Electric Company
Iias joined the scramble to develop
new sources ofenergy by setting up a
large kelp farm off the California
coast.

General Electric says it will usethe
farm. a one-fourth underwater
structure. to convert seaweed into
methane gas.

Giant California kelp will be
planted on the structure. made up of
concrete poles interconnected by a
plastic or nylon line. The module
will be floated 60 feet below the
surface. and a pump will draw
nutrients for the kelp from depths of
IOOO feet or more.

The farm is expected to produce
about 12.5 tons ofdry kelp per year.
according to GE technicians. The

as sludge and garbage are consumed.
The process will eventually produce
methane gas.

GE expects to be installing kelp
farms up to |00.000 acres in size by
I985.

LOW COST ENERGY

Three consumer and
environmental groups are charging
that the Energy Research and
Development Administration and
the Honeywell Corporation are
sabotaging the development of
inexpensive solar energy.

The Public Interest Research
Group. Consumer Action Now. and
the Center for Science in the Public
Interest. hiivc charged that the
Honeywell Corporation. with the
blessing and funding of the federal
government. has been touring the
country for three years with an
exhibit which allegedly promotes
solar energy.

The three groups charge. however.
that the exhibit is clearly designed to
discourage the public from investing
in cheap solar power.

The exhibit. designed and
operated by Honeywell. but funded
under a contract with the Energy
Research and Development Agency
(ERDA). is called the ’I'ransportuble
Solar Laboratory('l‘Sl.). Honeywell
representatives go on tour with the
lab and give lectiircsto local officials
and the general public about the
possible future of solar power.

John Abbotts. a spokesperson for
the three consumer groups. says.
however. that the TSl. laboratory
only plugs expensive solar
equipment. and that lectures given
by Honeywell representatives
encourage state energy officials to

nvest only in the. r-pi-ie‘ed '

equipment which Honeywelllmakes.
The consumer and environmental
groups say the currentTSL exhibit

makes a mockery of low-cost'solail'~

energy and reveals the government‘s
(quote) “bias towards large. complex.
high technology" which the general
public cannot afford.

The groups have called on ER DA
to drop the Honeywell exhibit and
begin promoting low-cost solar
energy projects. ‘

HEADS ON BOARD

A sign of the changing times we
live in is this report from Gene
Roddenberry. the creator of "Star
Trek.“

Roddenberry says that the general
configuration of the famous
starship. The USS. Enterprise. will
remain almost the same as it was
before for the new twmhour
episodes of “Star Trek" that will be
filmed for television this fall.

One of the changes Roddenberry
has made is the inclusion of“heiids“
aboard the spaceship. Roddenberry
explains that I0 years ago. when
“Star Trek" made its television
debut. toilets Were never included in
a TV series. He credits the “Archie
liunker Show“ with mtikingthejolin
respectable.

HARD OF HEARING

The Muzak Corporation. the
company which pipes millions of
hours of music into offices and
factories. reports that it is actively
attempting to perfect music that no
one listens to,

According to the company. the
whole purpose of its service is to
provide music that people can
"hear". yet don‘t wantto“listen"to.

A news release reportsthat Muzak
technicians pour over every

“the commences?

, if
“stimulus quotient” dependi
how lively it is. According to Mun
the tunes are then arranged on tapes
sothat the melodies with the highest
"stimulus quotients” are timed to
coincide when workers in an office
or factory are the most tired. 7

In this way. says Muzak. their
music subtly perks up offices during
slow periods.

According to Muzak. the worst
complaint it can receive is a reaction
from customers “saying they like a
particular song.“ The company says
that memorable songs are removed
and toned down to prevent listeners
from relating to them. After all.
Muzak explains “we don‘t want
them (the workers) putting down
their pencils" on the job and
listening.

ROCKY, AND THE CIA

New York magazine is reporting
that former Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller met secretlyin I975 with
thethen CIAdircctor William Colby
in an attempt to head off a major
investigation into covert CIA
activities.

Investigative reporter Tad Szulc
(pronounced Shull) writes that the
secret Rockefeller-Colby meeting
took place in Rockefeller's office on
January 2lst of I975. This wasjust
I7 days after Rockefeller had been
appointed by President Ford to head
up what was described as a sweeping
investigation of the Central
Intelligence Agency.

The Albany Student Press wishes
everyone a safe and healthy
holiday weekend.
