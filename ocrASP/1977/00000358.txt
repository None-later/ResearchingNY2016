By DAVID SYLVESTER

ln I959, New York State Governcr
Nelson Rockefeller appointed a
Committee on Higher Education to study
the needs of the state‘s university system,
known as SUNY. The following yearthe
three-man committee recommended to
the governor that SUNY become a “top
quality system."

Today SUNY consists of 57
community, agricultural technology and
liberal arts schools and four university
centers. The cost: over one billion dollars.
Ten per cent, or over $l00 million, was
spent expanding the State University of
New York at Albany.

The Dean of students at Albany State
at that time, Clifton Thorne, cited many
economic beneﬁts that Albany could
expect from the construction of a new
uptown campus and the inﬂux of new
students.

“The construction would result in $3 to
$4 million being spent annually," he said
in 1962. “At present the college payroll is
just over $2 million. The increase in
faculty to 450 would double this. The
2600 students spend $I.5-$2 million
annually. By I970 the college expects an
enrollment of 10,000."

Despite Dean Thorne‘s statements, the
business community showed no
enthusiasm over expansion ofthe college.

“In fact," said a reporter for the Times-
Union at the time. Frances Rivett, “there
was some opposition to construction ofa
new campus on the pan of local
businessmen. The downtown businesses
in and around the Capital felt they would
be hurt by the new school. They felt it
would put students out of reasonable
distance of their shops." “’

Editor's Note: First in a two part series
examining the effect of students on the
Albany economy.

Note: the following news items were
gleaned from "Greece: A Monthly
Record, a newsletter published by the
Greek Embassy in Washington.

Total visits to Greek museums and
archaeological sites in I976 came to
nearly eight million in I976, an increase of
about 40% over I975.

The city of Nashville, Tennesee, has
commissioned Will Harder, an artist
from Illinois, to create a replica of
l’hidias‘ famous Athena l’arthcnos. The
replica will he forty feet high, will cost
$250,000, and will take two years to
complete. It will be housed in Nashville's
own "Parthenon," of course.

The proposal that the Olympic Games
should be held on a permanent site at
Olympia, instead of shifting to different
countries, has the support of the Greek
government and of many international
figures in the world of sports. The next
meeting of the International Olympics
(‘ommittee is expected to discuss the
proposal. Meanwhile four American
students of architecture, after visiting the
site, have begun to draw tip plans for
permanent facilities.

()tlyssean Journey" has just come to a

“The Colonic and Northway Malls are
much more accessible by car,“ he said.
There are more parking facilities and less
trafﬁc. The South Mall. meanwhile,
replaced nine thousand permanent
residents with six thousand commuters.
This has affected business inthe area."

“In the past ten years,” said Rivett,
“two department stores and three hotels
have gone out of business in the
downtown area. In their place are shops
geared towards the lunchtime crowd. But
this has nothing to do withthe students."

The New York State Department of
Commerce keeps close watch"over the
number and kinds of businesses in the
state. From I962, when construction on
the campus began, to I973, three years
after the school was fully operational, the
number of business operatiffg in Albany
County increased by only 24. In I962, 54
per cent of all stores were small,
employing between one and three people.
In I973 this same ﬁgure was 42 per cent.
indicating a trend towards large, all
purpose stores such as department stores,
supermarkets and chain stores.

The largest increase was in those stores
that provide services. These include
hotels and motels, laundries, cleaning
plants, linen supply, photography
studios. beauty parlors and barber shops.
There was an increase of over 200 of these
businesses from I962 to 1973. Yet these
are not often used by the average student.

What is used by the students are the
retail trade stores. These are general
merchandise shops, department stores,
food stores, gas stations, clothing and
accessories shops, furniture shops,
restaurants and bars and book stores. The
tbta 'mer of retail stores has dropped
by almost 300 unitsinthe I3 year period.

This trend towards fewer but larger
retail stores can best be reﬂected by the
outcrop of shopping plazas and malls in

photographic exhibit, and an
international yacht race between Corfu
and Ithaca (the last lap of Odysseus‘
voyage).

The government of Australia, in
response to the UNESCO appeal, has
donated 100,000 Australian dollars for
the preservation of the Acropolis of
Athens.

Dr. Constantine A. Trypanis, Greece's
Minister of Cultural Affairs, was
awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of
Humane Letters by Assumption College,
Worcester, Mass, at commencement
excercises held on May 21. Dr. Trypanis
was formerly Professor of Classics at the
University of Chicago.

A bronze replica of the famous
Charioteer of Delphi was unveiled at the
entrance to the Philadelphia Art Museum
on July 4. The inscription accompanying
the statue reads: “From the cradle of
democracy in the ancient world to the
cradle of democracy in the new world.
From the people of Greece to the people
of America."

A team of distinguished Japanese
archaeologists and geologists was at work
on the Greek island of Them (Santorini)
during the month of June. The team
produced a ninety minute film, for
showing on Japanese television. on the
archaeology and geology of the island.

.Iuly 24 was the third anniversary ofthe
restoration of democracy in Greece.

and around Albany. The largest of these
are the Colonic and Northtitay malls,
situated across from each other on
Central Avenue in Colonic. Here a
shopper can fulﬁll all his retail needs.

“Since opening in I966,“ said Assistant
Market Director at the Colonic Mall,
Rick Azotea, “we have had increased
sales each year. Yet we have no inﬂux of
students from the Albany State campus."

He attributes the mall's success to the
“large population base over many miles."
“We would show economic growth
without a regular student business," he
said.

Business consultant for the New York '

State Department of Commerce David
Caplan feels the students may have had
an affect on commerce here, “but only
slight.“

“The student.“ he said, “is not a
wealthy person and the impact of the
addition ofseveral thousand students is in
no way staggering. The inﬂux of a
thousand factory workers in a new plant
would be staggering to a community,
much more so than several thousand
students."

Caplan does credit the student
population with halting a downward
trend in business activity.

“You need a ten per cent increase in
population every year to merely maintain
your level of business activity," he said.
“The Albany area is faced with a decline
in population and, as a result, less
business. The students have helped
maintain a level of economic business
that would have been lost otherwise."

Caplan pointed out that “students only
affect certain businesses such as clothing
shops and housing, and even then a
student will only shop in storesthat arein
close proximity to where he or she dwells,
stores that are easily accessible. “The
Colonic Mall is not dependent on the

students,” he addcdtfslincc it»-
acccssiblc from the campus.“  ’,

Just what is the magnitudcof st 3
and staff involved? Accordingto the;
Ofﬁce of Institutional Research, located“
on campus, there was a total enrollment at
Albany State of H.673 graduate and
undergraduate students for the fall of
I976. There are ﬁve on-cmapus housing
facilities, each containing slightly over
one thousand students for a total of 5,452
on-campus students. This leaves 9,221
off-campus students and commuters.

According to an Assistant Director in
the ofﬁce “there is'no way of knowing
how many students are commuters and
how many have. moved to off-campus
facilities and are from outside the Albany
area.“ One person in the Off-Campus
Housing Office said there are “almost
4.000 students who move off-campus.“

Thus. eliminating commuters there is a
total yearly inﬂux ofaboutr9,4005tudents
to Albany.

From the employment side, a workerin
the Personnel Administration Ofﬁce
Evelyn Kene, said “there are l,32l
professional jobs which include faculty,
library staff, management and non-
teaching professionals. There are also 976
classified jobs. such as medical,
maintenance, clerical and security.“

“The classified help," she said, “is
usually hired locally while the
professional help is hired on a nationwide
basis.“

And the cost of all this? An assistant in
the University Finance Analysis budget
Ofﬁce, Paul Hogan said the payroll for
I976 was $34,286,000.

“The Average Institutional Salary for
faculty members," he said, “is $20,000 a
year for the entire SUNY system. This
ranges from $I2-$25,000 depending on
position. Albany State is slightly below
the statewide average.“
