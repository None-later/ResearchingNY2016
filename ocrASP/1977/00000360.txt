due to an ancient tradition of music.

industrypeople known as “hyping”.

-_ While those of us who work for radio
stations or other media get the “inside
line" on records. the average person pays
a great deal of money for an LP, and is
often left out of the “groove”, so tospeak.

. . Now on to the goodies. The big news of

the week comes to us from Rolling Stones
Records. Yes. the long awaited live
Stones album is scheduled to be released
September 20th.

The album was recorded in Europe
(France, i believe) and Toronto.
Selections on the album “Get off

of My Cloud,” and quasi-disco. “Hot Stuff."

The lawsuit brought by members of
Heart against their original record
company, Mushroom Records, (they
now record for CBS/ Portrait) has been
settled—not much to the group‘s liking
Heart had at least one full album in the
can before they switched labels, and
Mushroom wanted to release the album
(called Magazine) to compete with Little
Queen. Heart sued. has lost, and
Magazine will beout in a couple ofweeks.

In other important developments, the
Moody Blues have started recordingtheir
new album which is scheduled to be
ﬁnished in early October. Also, John
Miles‘ new album will be out in
November and Canadian rockers April
Wine have scheduled their new release for
September l5th.

 

 
  
   
 
    
 
   
 
    
  
 

 
   

   
   
  
   
   
   

   

    

  

   

The Moody Blues are recording a new album which is due In early October.

Looking at Best Seller charts we see
that Fleetwood Mac and Crosby Stills
and Nash are vying for the number one
spot. Both have cut excellent albums
(subject to much heated debate from
long-time fans of both groups) and I‘m
glad to see some quality music achieve
commercial success.

As far as those little seven-inch discs
with the big holes, there are a lot of new
releases and most of them are pleasant
surprises. From Neil Young’s “American
Stars and Bars" (considered by many of his
fans to be his best since “After the
Goldrush“). Reprise has released a
tastefullycut version of “ Like a Hurricane."

It clocks in at 5:25 and is more listenable
thanthe album out which was a little long.

My favorite of the week has been culled
from the Robert Gordon with Link Wray
album. It's an old Leadbelly
song called “Red Hot." Just to whet
your taste buds the opening lines are My
gal is Red Hot. Your gal ain‘t doodley
squat. Punk Rock and Leadbelly are.
definitely intriguing—and fun too.

Ringo Starr‘s new single is called
"Wings" (showing shades of John Lennon
How Do You Sleep?) Kate Taylor is
following in the footsteps of Rita
Coolidge with her remake ofthe old Betty
Everett song, It’s In His Kiss.

  
    

Pablo Cruise has a ﬁne follow-up to
Whatcha Gonna Do with title track of
their album, A Place In the Sun. The new
single release off of Dave Mason‘s Let It
Fow is We Just Disagree.

My ﬁnal intriguing tid-bit ofthe week
is that after over ﬁve weeks on Billboards
Top IOO, the Ramones' Sheena IsA Punk
rocker is number 86! It deserves to be
number one,just for the tambourines!

Oh. by the way, I am looking for a
name for this column, that is iftheyallow
me to leave my rubber room once a week
