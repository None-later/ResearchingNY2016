This adds to your \ycll-hcing. it sciisclhiit your
time has not been trusted. lhis is based oil the
universally accepted theory that no one is truly
happy until he is miserable.

Ex-l’rcsidcnt Richard M. Nixon once said
that. "Misery loves company." and he was
right (if he indccd did say that). Making
someone else miserable is one of life‘s lesser
knownjoys. It is always better to bcniiscruble

would like to share your new found huppiucss
with, preferably that guy who stole your girl

At SUNYA, studentsha've no say in the contraceptive clinic. At
Buffalo, the program is student controlled. ‘ :
_At SUNYA, students must be over l8 to receive birth controlCAt
Binghamton, age doesn’t matter. - .,
At SUNYA, students must, pay'Sl8 for a gynecological exam. At
Nassau Community it is free. ' ‘ . - ' 7
For a large progressive campus, SUNYA is seriously deficient in its
health serViccs. The Campus Contraceptive Clinic is supported by
Etudent customers. yet students have no input in administrative
BCISIOI‘IS.

It is ludicrous to operate a student health service on campus and then I

force students into off-campus clinics for information on birth control,
or counseling for pregnancy or rape.

The ﬁrst steps are being taken. Student Association and the office of
Student Affairs are currently investigating the feasibility of a sexuality
clinic, but support is urgently needed if a student-controlled clinic of any
shape or form is to work. And it's needed now.

As The Stomach Turns

While the near confirmation of Erastus Corning as mayor of
Albany crushes all real hope of major city improvement, perhaps it‘s not
too late to save the thousands who are presently suffering at the hands of
our UAS quad kitchens.

Use any expletive you wish to describe it. the quad food has gone
downhill since last year.

One could take pot shots at the food, saying the Federal government
was forced to create a quality standard below “Unsafe for Human
Consumption" to stamp the food. Or that the plant department is using
the qhad food to poison the pigeons who roost on the PAC, or that the
army is experimenting with UAS chili as a new biological weapon.

The truth, however, speaks for itself.

At Alumni yesterday, cheeseburgers consisted ofa patty on a stale roll
with an unmelted piece of cheese on top. lndian last week got the hint
when the kitchen served for dinner the "Dieter’s Delight", tuna stuffed
into a tomato. Dutch Quad residents look longineg at the Kosher diners
 thiey slice into an under-cooked chicken and dodge the spurting

oo .

There is an old SUNYA axiom that applies in this case. “There aretwo

ways to the heart of a student: through his cume or his stomach."

We could all use a 4.0 and a square meal
