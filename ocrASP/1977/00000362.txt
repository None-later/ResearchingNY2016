A.  Time. Goes Up 
in Smoke

by Richie Mermels'teln

OnDeoembcr l2. I976, the Albany Student
Press ran a front page story entitled "Smoking
Banned in Class to Combat Health Hazard."
The article was a bit premature at the time.
Nine months later, the story seems totally
ﬁctitious.

Traditionally. things don‘t‘ get done too
quickly at Albany. Back in I974, the ASP
carried a handful of articles on impending
ﬁeldhouse proposals. Throughout the early
‘70's, the ASPtold us that WSUA's struggle to
receive FM licensing was soon to end
successfully.

These instances might be looked at as proof
of the Ask: shoddy reporting. But closer
perusal will show that the articles were based
on clear cut statements by administrators that
these events will take place.

Such was the case with the smoking articles.
I wrote three of them.

The saga of the classroom smoking
phaseout is not unlike many tales of SUNYA‘s
bureaucratic mismanagement. It has a hazy
beginning, a middle ﬁlled with red tape piled.
and no ending.

In the fall of'76. Louis lsmay. on behalf of
the Environmental Decisions Committee.
recommended to President Fields that
classroom smoking be eliminated by January
l. 1977. Fields assigned the matter to Vice

President of Student Affairs Lewis Welch,
who proposed a “consciousness raising"
campaign. He. in turn. chose University
Community Council President Pat Buchalter
to head the program. ‘

By this time. months had passed since the
EDC started their anti-smoking drive. Years
had passed since former SUNYA President
Louis Benczet ﬁled away memos urging hini to
ban classroom smoking.

Finally, as a ﬁrst step. sign were posted
requesting that multi—lingual students refrain
from smoking. The signs were as potent asthe
Articles of Confederation and are no more
visible on campus than the colonies‘ first
document of law. This first stepturned out to
be two steps in one—the ﬁrst and the last.

The,,semcstcr ends. Pat Buchalter. who
guaranteed that smoking would be curtailed
by the fall of ‘77. finds a pink slip in her
mailbox. Lou lsmay also finds one. And our
president. who had promised to give all
recommendations “appropriate weight" in
forming a plan based on “the breadth of
support " for such a policy. decidesto move on
to greener fields.

The would-be head of the EDC decided
only a few weeks ago not to return to SUNYA.
So, the only group seemingly concerned for
the health of non-smokers will be a vacuous
force for a while.

Double cross
the common crowd.

Nixon’s
Last Chorus

by Neil H. Butterklee

(A Parody of John Denver's “Leaving On A Jet Plane")

Oh. my tapes are packedI I’m ready to go.

My pardon‘s set. my pension too.

I hate to ask you but there's no one else.
Oh, the story's breaking. the jig is up.
My aides are cracking, it's getting tough.
Already it’s so hot that l could fry.

C horas

Oh the days grow short and I must go.
i tell you Jerry, I‘ll miss you so.

I hate to say goodbye. but i must leave.
Down in San Clemente, 1 will go.

it’s to you Jerry. my life l owe.

I almost made it. King Dicky i would be.

Chorus

Oh they‘ll write a book someday I know,
0f Haldeman. John Dean and Mo.
They seem to proﬁt just at my expense.
Spiro‘s been the only one before.

But when I go they‘ll miss me more.
Already it's so lonesome I could die.

Chorus

Chorus:
So hear me and pray for me.
Tell me that you'll pardon me.
Now I know to jail I'll never go.
Cause I'm leaving from

‘ the White House
Can't say that I‘ll be back again.
Oh Jen. I hate to go.
