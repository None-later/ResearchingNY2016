(AP) Jimmy Connors is a
chameleon. a man of complex
moods and changing personality
traits. hut'is still the best tennis
player in the world. says Bill
Riordan.

Riordan speaks with authority.
He is the Syengali who helped
fashion two of the maddest geniuses
ot‘ the game the fiery. feisty
Connors and the talented.
tempestiious llie Nastnse.

Nastase has made an early exit. a
victim at his own unbridled
temperament. but Connors.

remains iii the thick of the fight for
the men‘s US Open tennis
championship. to be decided at
l'til‘csl llills this weekend.

“Jimmy can win it it he can gel his
head all together." predicted
Riordan. wealthy Salisbury. Md..

to itiillioiiairc status.

"it's not .lininiy's back you llil\‘t' to

He is torn up emotionally. First.

traveling the circriit with his mother.
High strung as he is. he must be
asking himself. ‘My God. was all this
worth it'."

“Then l wonder who. if anybody.
is calming him down. He is typically
a \olatilc. high strung person. The
one thing i think I was able to do for
him when we were together was keep
him loose."

Riordan managed Connors from
I972 through l975 when the
relationship was broken by Jimmy‘s
mother. (ilorin.
