‘ The Albany State ,varsity tennis
team's season. opener was an
unsuccessful one, as they dropped a
5-4 decision at the hands of Oneonta
State. Wednesday at Oneonta.

But despitethe loss. Albany‘s head
coach Robert Lewis was no:
disappointed. “This year our team
isn‘t as strong as in the past." said
Lewis. He was referring to the fact
that only two members of last year‘s
l3-4 team participated in

  

i ' Wednesday‘s match.

 

Not to be overlooked however. is
the strength of Oneonta‘s team. Last
year Oneonta won the SUNYAC‘s.
edging out Albany. And Lewis feels
this year‘s team is just as strong.

For Albany. as in the past. Paul
Feldman won his number oncsingles
match. Feldmiin has never lost.to
another SUNYAC opponent in his
two year college career. Wednesday.
he beat Oneonta‘s top player Jeff
Rubin in straight sets 6-3. 6-3.

Albany was still in the match at

take the team victory. They came
close but tell one match short.

problems in the beginning bill with
some hard work we should improve.
And it hen l’hil Ackcrinnn returnsto

Whilc tomorrow is Albany‘s first
regular season game. they did play it
scrimmage against |(|’l last week.
Albany crushed RI’I 15-0 iii the
game but conch I‘ot‘d doesn't know
for sure whether the score or the
quality ol the game showed that
Albany was that good or if Itl’l
wasn't.

ball well but were sporadic. “()ur
passing attack was inconsistent and
we didn't block that well.“s:iid Ford.
“ to beat St. [torrent-e. we‘re going
to Ittl\‘t: to be more consistent and
also itot make mistakes on the field.
like turnovers.“

When Albany was on dclcnsc.

It l’l couldn‘t do it thing with the ball.
The Danes' defense held RM to very
low yardage and only one first down.
"Defensivety. \\L‘ looked pretty
good. But St. Laurence will be the
real test." sttid l-ord.

And when St. Lawrence has the
ball tomorrow. the defense better be
on their toes. Ihc one thing that
tintka St, Laurence such a threat
ollcnsucly is their \ersntility.
according to I-ord. “St. Lawrence is
a well balanced team and can do it
all. 'I hey can run manic or outside.
