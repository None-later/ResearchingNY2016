opposing, one of i the top collegiate
teams in England. the Unviersity of
BirminghamThe game .will start at 5
p.rn. on the soccer ﬁeld and tickets

are specially priced at 50 centsfor _

SUNYA students. . .

, “The. Birmingham exhibition
game will be a ﬁne tune-up for our
regular season which begins Sept. I7
against Keene State.” said head
coach Bill Schieffelin. “Birmingham
is an agrcssivc. fast paced team. and
is expected to be more physical than

. the teams we are used to playing."

After the Birmingham match.
SUNYA takes on Keene State. a
team which defeated the hooters last
year in the rain. 2-0. "This is one of
the three key games ofthe year. If we
am beat Kcenc State. Oneonta. and
Cortland. we‘ll be strong against the
two other powerhouses in the
schedule. Hartwick and St. Francis."
remarked Schieffelin.

 

Oneoiita‘. ti'Division l team has
strengthened itself by picking up

‘ some talented recruits. Cortland has

most of their team returning. a team
which lost the New York State
Division III ﬁnals last year;

. These two teams. along with
Potsdam and Plattsburgh compose
the eastern division of the
SUNYAC. The eastern division
winner hosts the western winner for
the conference title in November.

Hartwick has also completed an
excellent recruiting year. They are
coming into the season as strong as
ever. hoping to improve on last
year‘s number three ranking in the
nation. St. Francis (NY). another
Division I opponent, was also
ranked nationally seventeenth. In
addition. St. Francis was ranked
number two in the state behind
Hartwick.

“The quality of competition which
we face this year is high caliber. but
we are considerably stronger than
last year. as we have lots of depth

and more size than last year.“ said
Schieffelin.

The squad had thirteen returning

lettermen from last year‘s 8-5-I
team. Senior forward Frank Selea
will supply the scoring punch. as he
holds the SUNYA record for most
goals in a season (l9). Last year.
Selca was named all-SUNYAC and
all~State.

Senior Matty Denora. juniors
Carlos Arango and Jorge and Pepe
Aguilar. as well as freshman Kevin
Leary will all be helping out at
forward and midfield.

Defense Shapes Up

The defense shapes up with
seniors Stanley Gage. Aldo
Sergovich. and Ricardo Rose. last
year‘s all-SUNYAC defcnseman.
Juniors Mark Wench and Dave

freshman. Alex I’agano round out
the defense.

afternoon. Sicna did it by combining
stolen bases (six. including a double

proved too awesome for Albany.

Smith hit a similar drive to left
center. the ball caroming off
Nelson‘s glove once more as Helm
raced home with the ﬁrst run ofthe
game. Both hits werejust out of the
reach of the speedy Nelson.

A walk to Warren Pickett and a fly
to right set the stage for the game‘s
big blow. a three-run home run to
deep right center by Sierra third-
bascman llob Murphy. What
Muldoon later termed his “one
mistake" had put Albanyinthe hole.

The Indians scored another in the
third. two in the fourth. and three
more in the ﬁlth to seal the victory.

Gridders To Be Tested In
Season’s Opener Tomorrow

by Eddie Emerman

The Albany Strife varsity football
team opens its l977-78 season on the
road tomorrow against a strong St.
Lawrence team which Robert Ford.
Albany‘s head coach. feels will test
his Great Danes in chry way.

St. Lawrence is one of two new
schools added to Albany‘s schedule.
which doesn‘t include their arch
rival. Ithaca College. While the
Danes were having their worst
season since gaining varsity status.
the Saints were enjoying one of its
best. St. Lawrence was the number
three team in the nation in Division
Ill. finishing with a 9-2 record. They
were also named ECAC team ofthe
year.

Unfortunately for Albany. coach
Ford thinks St. Lawrence isjust as
st roug this year. “They are a
formidable team and only lost a few
players from last year‘s team.“ said
Ford.

lin route to posting their 9-2
record. St. Lawrence managed to
shut out four opponents and hold
two others to seven points or less.

lint not to be overlooked is their
offense which averaged over 30
points per game.

The man who makes St.
Lawrence‘s offense tick is their
quarterback Kirk Dempsey. “lie is
the basis of their offense." said .Iack
Siedlicki. Albany's defense
coordinator.

Dempsey. an All-American. led
the nation in passing last year with
some incredible statistics. He threw
nearly 290 times and completed I40
of them for I945 yards. In addition.
l9 of those completions went for
touchdowns. Along the way. he set
career. seasoit and game records in
every category from passing to total

offense.

Dempscy‘s primary targets
tomorrow will be John Crandall and
Mike Watkins. Crandall.the leading
receiver for St. Lawrence last year
with 39 receptions. does not have
good speed but can run cxccllcnt
pass routes. Watkins is the guy the
defense has to worry about.
according to Sicdlicki. "Watkins has
exceptional speed."

Dempscy‘s weapon isn‘t limited to
his arm. He also is an excellent
runner himself and he showed it last
year by carrying the htill I40 times.

And when Dempsey isn't
throwing the ball or running with if.
he'll hand it offto one of his running
backs. either llob McCann or Mark
filridge. McCann is a four year
starter and Elridge is a good runner
who has been injured much of the
last two years. McCann led his team
last year with 550 yards on I38
carries.

One reason for St. Lawrence's
strongattack is their offensive line. It
averages 235 pounds and in the
middle of it is their All-liast center
l’etc llaycs.

ll Albany is going to stop St.
Lawrence‘s attack. they'll have to
stop them on first downs. according
to Sicdlicki. “ The key to stopping
their attack is to hold them to a
couple of yards on first down. If we
don't. they can do almost anything
they want." said Siedlicki. I

St. Lawrence‘s defense is led by
two time All-American safety Mitch
Brown. Brown will also handle the
kickoff and punt returns. much to
the displeasure of the Danes. lirown
led the nation in those categories last
year averaging 22 yards on a kickoff
return and l l yards on a punt return.

TAP Toughens Emancipated Student Criteria

by Valerie Molinaro
A new TAP award schedule,
implemented to contain cost over-

runs has prevented many.studertts..».

from receiving financial aid under
the emancipated student status.
Students who can verify financial
independence usually receive large
'I'AI’ awards from the Higher
Education Services Corporation.
which administers the Tuition
Assistance and Regents Scholarship
programs. However. this year. the
Corporation has substantially
abridged awards to emancipated
students who are single with no
dependents. The new schedule
produces a radical cut-back in TAI’
funds for such students whose
incomes range from $l000~$5666.
The Corporation released
estimates earlier this year which
projected that about 12.000
emancipated students will be

ineligible for TAP because of the

Director of Residences John Welty said that “a number of options" are
being considered to help alleviate problems with transportation attho

new income cut-off. and another
27.000 single students will ﬁnd their
awards reduced.

SASU legislative. Director Jocl
Packer said. “The income cut-off
point is arbitrary and the schedule as
a whole is too restrictive." Packer
said that emancipated students have
fewer assets than dependent students
to put toward tuition payments. and
a greater amount of their limited
income is used in establishing a
household. SASU has filed suit
against the Corporation in an
attempt to repeal the new
regulations.

The award reduction was the only
one of five budget cuts
recommended by Governor Hugh
Carey that the State Legislature
approved this ﬁscal year.

Most graduate students declare
ﬁnancial independence from their
parents and qualify for a higher TAP
award based on the reduced income

claiming emancipation increased
from 43.354 ( I9 er cent ofthe total)
to 62.l22 (24 per cent) from I974n75
to 1975-76. The number of
undergraduates claiming
emancipation increased by over 43
per cent from 29.637 in I974-75 to
42.487 in I975-76. TAP paymentsto
emancipated students doubled in
cost. totalling $29.7 million in I975-
76.

A State Senate staff member said.
“The emancipation claims at that
point were breaking the bank. We
had to contain the cost over-run or
face the threat of a ten per cent cut

across the board."
Packer noted that the new
schedule does not account for the

erratic earning proﬁle of. many.

college students. If a student is
forced to leave school for a year of
part of a year to work because TAP
and other ﬁnancial aid were not
enough. and then quits the job to
return to school. a TAP award is
even less likely. Because the award is
based upon the previous year's
income. a student is expected to meet
expenses based on a salary no longer
being earned.

Problems Plague Motel Residents

by Matthew Cox

Students housed at the Country
Squire Motel in Guilderland. where
68 residents rely on a single
Chevrolet van to take them on the
eight mile trip to and from campus.
say transportation is the largest of
the many problems they've had to
deal with.

But while some of the other
difficulties they've faced~~such as a
scarcity of room furniture-have
been alleviated. students there said
there are delays in telephone
installation. and that electrical wall
outlets which don‘t hold plugs ﬁrmly
still remain unfixcd.

The students at the Western
Avenue motel were housed therefor
the fall semester when rooms on
campus and at the Hotel Wellington
downtown became filled.

Richard Becker. a student at the
motel. said residents without cars
find themselves "tremendously
dependent" on the van service.

The van makes the trip to campus
at intervals of roughly two hours.
Becker said. beginning at 9:30 a.m.

Sheila Parker said she regularly
leaves the motel at that hour. but
that because of her class schedule
and dinner plan can't return until
7:00 pm.

“When you live here your whole
day is centered around that van." she
said. “In the morning I take all the
books I‘ll need with me and stay on
campus all day."

The manager of the motel. Eddie
Unscr. called the van transportation
an "optional arrangement" he
provides “because I feel an
obligation to these students."

“I‘m losing money on these trips."
he said.

Students pay twenty-ﬁve cents to
ride the van into the campus. or else
ride with other students who have
cars. Unscr said.

Diredor of Residences John
Welty acknowledged that there were
transportation problems at the
motel. but said he has "no ﬁrm plans
yet" for easing them. Adding
additional van runs to the present
schedule could solve the problem. he
said.

“There are a number of options
being considered." Welty said.

Becker said the living
arrangements the motel provided
were “fine. once you get here. It's
getting here. the transportation.
that's difficult."

Lorrie Schall. one qfﬁve freshmen
housed at the Country Squire. said
the motel management has “tried to

 

help me out" with routine housing
problems. But some residents said
that when bureaus and desks were
brought in by truck. students had to
carry the furniture from a driveway
at the motel to their rooms with no
assistance from the motel staff.

“If my father knew what things
were really like here. he'd come upin
a minutc.“ Becker said.

Staning yesterday. the van service
for Country Squire residents was
changed in an effort to
accommodate the schedules of more
students. Welty said early reactions
to the new schedule indicated that
problems still existed. and that
“somethingelse is going to have to be
worked out.“
