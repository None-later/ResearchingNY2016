Vote on Student Senators Fails

by Jill Haber

An amendment to the faculty by-
laiis that would have made students
permanent members of the
Unitersity Senate failed to receive
the necessary quorum of mail
responses over the summer. leasing
the issue unresolved. according to
Senate liaison Hugh Hill.

()l .those mail ballots that did
come itt lrom faculty. he said. the
vote on the issue was running about
two-to-one against permanent
student representation.

Currently. 22 undergraduate
students and II graduate students
are granted seats in the Senate on a
two-year pron‘sional basis.

The proposal for permanent
student representation on the
University was first drafted and
submitted tothe Senate by last year's
Senate liaison Paul Feldman.

No Quorum

At ti faculty meeting in May. at
which time the issue was to have
been put to a vote. less than the
required 40 per cent of the faculty
was present. Mail ballots were sent
out to all faculty members over the
summer. but also failed to produce
the necessary quorum. I

Hill said he sees no danger tn
students losing provisional Senate
membership. but said permament
representation will be difficult to

Grant to SUNYA Aids
Solar Energy Research

by Jeffrey Neuburger

A 1.25 million dollar grant has
been awarded to SUNYA to enable
it to carry out a multi-faceted
program dealing with solar energy
and research.

The study is headed by Associate
director of SUNYA's Atmospheric
Science Research Center Ronald
Stcwan and Chairman of the
Atmospheric Science Dept. Harry
Hamilton.

“The study is divided into the
areas of research." said Stewart,
"graduate and undergraduate
dealings. technical training. and
engineer and architect training."

Research. a major area of the
study. shall attempt to access how
much solar energy is potentially
available in the Northeastern United
States. said Stewart. A series of
experiments shall be performed to
determine the effect of ozone. cloud

A voter registratio‘h drive began
yesterday at SUNYA, sponsored by
several student organizations.

‘The drive. which will continue
through Sept. 28. .is aimed at
registering students and providing
them with a convenient means of
applying for absentee ballots.

The organizations sponsoring the
drive are NYPIRG. OCA. SUM
(Student Unionization Movement).
SASU and SA.

“We'll be registering people who
haven't voted and those who haven't
registered in the past two years.“ said
SASU Coordinator Sharon Ward.
“We are also following through all
the way on the absentee ballot
forms."

The absentee ballot process takes
three steps. according to Ward.
First. students have to ﬁll out an

 

absentee ballot request form. after
which they receive an absentee ballot
application. This is followed by the
actual absentee ballot.

“We will be keeping in contact'
with the local election boards to
make sure they are getting all of the
absentee ballotsand forms out." said
Ward. “We will be setting up a
hotline to take complaints about
absentee ballots and then put
pressure on the local election boards.
Last year there were some really big
problems and we're trying to avoid
those hassles.“

Ward said that even though this is
an off-election year. “we're of the
belief that every election is
important“ and that “student power
comes from the masses. that‘s what
gets things done.“

“We‘re providing a service for

NYPIRG Chairperson Howie

According to Off Campus

students who are eligible to vote in

have to have some kind of political

registered increases our political
power.“

Acting SUNYA l’rcsident Vincent
O‘Leary said he talked yesterday
with a state official on the progress
of funding for the renovation of the
Draper campus downtown. and was
told by the official that he was
“pushing rapidly“ for the clearance
of a bond issue and “optimistic”
about getting results.

"But I have learned to be cautious
in these matters." O'Leary said.
“We're in the pipeline for funding,
that‘s about all I can say."

The renovation ofthe old teachers V

college facilities is necessary before
space in Mohawk Tower can be
made available for student housing.

Hall campus once that facility is
renovated.

A lack of dormitory space on
campus this semester resulted in the
housing of about 70 students at the
City/Squire Motel in Guilderland.

O‘Lettry said his own estimates on
a start date for _the downtown
renovation “are not so optimistic. It

you can tell me when the renovation
will stttrt. though. i can give you-a
date for moving more students into
Mohawk ’l‘ower.“ he said.

O‘Leary said a rough estimate ofa
year to a year and a half could be
given. of the time students might be
able to move into Mohawk Tower
after renovation downtown begins.

“It'll be somewhere in there."

iO'Leary said. “But we have to get

started first."
