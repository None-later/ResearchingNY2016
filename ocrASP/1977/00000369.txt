Emancipation claims are among

This year, the new criteria for

included in the TAP application.

, Students over 34 years of age may be
automatically considered
emancipated, and students between
22 and 34 years of age must meet the
three already existing criteria to
cmancipate: that the students receive
less than 5600 during the year from
their parents. that they not be
declared as tax dependents by their
parents. and that they not have lived
with their parents for more than two
weeks at a time.

previously received higher awards
were no longer considered
emancipated. A student must prove

’ that, hardship conditions exist: that

he is of orphan status. -that his
parents cannot provide for him and
he has become a Ward of the court. or

his parents have disinherited him or'

' HESC Vice-President for
Research and Policy Analysis
Michael Cruskie said that the
Corporation needs documentation
of family circumstances to verify
emancipation. .

“This has proved to be difﬁcult
since we have no field workers.
We‘re not a social services-type
agency." said Cruskie.

Cruskic admitted that the law
does not account for undergraduate
students whose parents refuse to

circumstance that may constitute a
hardship condition for some
students. ' _ V

Crusltie added that he cannot
justify the extreme award
differential that the schedule
generates between the married and
the single student. ,

Cruskie said. “Under the new
schedule. if an emancipated student
is single with no dependents and
earned a net taxable income of
$6.000 last year he would receive no
award. However. a married student
earning $14,000 would qualify for
$870 under the already existing
schedule." The inequities are
surfacing on a case by case basis. as
appeals are received by the
Corporation counsel‘s ofﬁce.

The SASU laWsuit pending
against HESC is an attempt to repeal
the new age guidelines. I

Attorney Richard Lippcs,
retained by SUNY-Bttffalo which is
funding the lawsuit. said. “We’re
waiting for a motion for preliminary
injunction to restrain the

Stipend Policy in Limbo

continued from page one

Central Council.

“We wanted to change that. We}
had hoped that a new policy would
be formulated. It didn't pass,
thought."

A proposal by last year's stipend
committee. headed by Jim‘Aronoff.
was defeated by Central Council.
The proposal had provisions for
stipends for the Torch. the radio
station. University Concert Board
and Speakers Forum. ~

The latter two groups did not
receive stipend lines last year. but
have received them in the past.

“Not only are the jobs we do
responsible and have an effect on
large amounts of students." said
Concert Board Vice Chairman Jeff
Stern, “but we also save the school
money. By booking concerts we save
on agents. middlemen. All of the
professional stuff is done by
students."

The decision to stipend the
managers of the newly formed
record co—op has drawn criticism in
regards to the current situation.

“I believe it is the height of nerve
for an individual in SA to determine
that one oftheir pct projects deserves
stipending while the larger existing
groups are in this position." said
Roscnthal.

The record co—op was formed by
Hetchkop.

“I gave stipends because I felt it
was necessary to get the co—op off its

feet," said Gold. “There was a great
burden on a few people to make sure
of its success.” -

“I felt it was necessary." said
Hetchkop. “These students are
responsible for a large amount of
money and duties. For an initial
operation. we needed that extra bit
of compensation."

Gold emphasized that the decision
to give stipends in this case was made
while Central Council was not in’
session—now that it is in session.
Council has“ ‘ ' ’ on " “'

Stumbling Block

The question of which groups
should receive stipend lines and how
much they should receive has been a
major stumbling block in the
development of speciﬁc policy.

“It's a very capricious decision."
said Gold. “Does the radio station
deserve stipends. and EOPSA
doesn‘t'.l How do you decide? There
isn't enough money to give everyone
a stipend. and everyone really
shouldn't get one.“

Roscnthal said that SA funded
groups classified as “media” and
“mass programming" should receive
stipend lines.

“I would make that distinction.“
said Roscnthal. “These people have
the farthest reaching responsibility
to the students at large."

“The whole thing is specific
criteria." said Hctchkop. “Some
policies have come out ofthin air;
it's very hard to deal with."

Havkins said‘that‘in his research.
he couldn‘t ﬁnd a definite policy on‘
stipends iit thepittséve‘n years. , 3

“Without policy; it‘s' arbitrary.“
said Hat/kins. _“People went '. to
council and requested stipend lines.
and council-decided." ‘ ,

A two-man 1975-76 Council com-
mittee proposed a policy which
speciﬁed stipend lines for'the cant-
pus radio station. the Albany Stu-
dent Presl (which was SA funded‘at
the time). Torch. and the SA ex-
ecutive branch. Council soundly
defeated the proposal. ‘

Gold said that he would like force
the " , of academic credit
instead of stipends. He said that if
the decision ever got to him. he
would consider abolishing stipends.

I best solution. Paying people to work ‘
is not the best way. I‘d definitelytakc

academic credit can be gained for

gets academic credit. Gold 'said. one
will have time to go to work because
there would be a minimum amoum
of classes. ‘
' Rejected

The l975-76 committee
looked into this possibility but
rejected it. After discussing the.
feasibility of academic credit with
several administrators. they
concluded that “students Would

discovered the controls that would

possible. , r 1

“I would prefer having more time
on this rather than being rushed."
said Havkin. The history of Ceniral
Council reactions to stipend
committees ‘is clearly not on the
committee's side.

Rosenthal said that action might
be taken by several groups if some
decision doesn't come about soon. “I
think that if there is no action taken
in a short time. independent action
will be taken.”
