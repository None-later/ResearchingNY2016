This‘ peaceful little resort

scheduled to host the I980 winter
games —— already has an answer.
though it has been lost amid the pre-
Olympic hoopla. As soon as the

«ills, N.Y.). who represents Lake

Placid‘s district in congress. “and
this seems to be an answer to our

Plans for the new prison. intended
as a minimum security facility
mostly for first-time narcotics
offenders lit to 25 years old. have
already been funded by Congress
and signed into law by President
Caner.

The idea for a prison apparently
grew out of the Olympic Organizing
committee‘s desire to attract federal
funding for a housing complex that
otherwise would have a life
expectancy of less than two months.

prison plan was the most desirable.

Congress approved $22 million
for the project late this spring in the
form of a supplemental budget
appropriation for federal prison
construction.

Mr. McEwen and other
suppoﬂers of the prison—who
include most of Lake Placid‘s
political leaders and ofﬁcials of the
Federal Bureau of Prisons—also
contend that such a facility, designed
as a prison, would provide strong
security for Olympic athletes.

During the I972 Munich summer~

games. they point out. Arab
terrorists raided the athletes"
compound to seize members of the

Israetl'who eventually were -

killed ii’n‘the ensuing shootout.

Supporters of the prison plan also
claim the prison will help provide
jobs for residents of the Lake Placid
area, where unemployment is
running 18.4 per cent.

Thus far therehas been little press
coverage on the prison plan and no;
organized protest from townspeople
or athletes.

But the project does have its
critics.

It “clearly violates the spirit ofthc

games.“ says Andy Hall.
coordinator of the National
Moratorium on Prison

Construction.

Critics also charge the location of
the facility in the Adirondacks is
inconsistent with the stated policy of
the Federal Bureau of Prisons of
trying to locate new prisons“as close

     

. ‘r ‘
‘ as we can humanly get to where the
offenders are from."

ATOM MAN

The Vermont 'Ynnkee Power
Corporation is out with a new
mascot to promote the use of atomic
energy: His name? “Atom Man."

According to New Times
magazine. Atom Man‘s mission is to
appear on television and in his
words. "To be ever alert for
misinformation about power and
correct it wherever I can.“

The magazine says that in one
rcccnt TV ad. Atom Man appeared
“big-brothcr-Iikc“ in the bathroom
of a citizen and chustizcd him for
telling friends that “nuclear power is
not sul'c."

New Times notes that Atom Man
forgot to mention that Yankee
I’owcr. just two years, spilled 83.000
gallons of nuclear wastes into the
Connecticut River. He’s also
reported to have failed to help the
company when it recently repaired
cracked safety pipes at one of its
rcactors even though “Atom Man" is
said to be equipped with “ﬁssion
vision."

 

Armed with this new legislation.
the U.S. Ofﬁce of Education plans to
set its computers loose on records
from the Internal Revenue Service
and the military and state motor
vehicle agencies in efforts to hunt
down an estimated 250,000

defaultcrs.

PAY FOR AN "A".

Lehigh University students —
some ofthcm at least ~ havefound a
novel way to upgrade their bad
marks.

The Pennsylvania university's
officials say they have uncovered a
scheme involving payments by
students of as much as $2000 per
student to alter grades in the school‘s
computer.

Austin Gavin. tt Lchigh official.
says the scheme was discovered only
because university ofﬁcials received
anonymous letters which alleged
that students were buying grades.
Lchigh officials checkch last
semester's grades. intcrvicwcd
students. and discovered that
someone had bcctt gctting into the
registrar‘s office to altcr the grade
cards which arc fed into the school's
computer.

Gavin reports that fivc
undergraduates suspected III the
scheme have failed to register for
classes this scmcslcr. and that it
Iormcr cmploycc of tile registrar's
officc is a prime suspch in the grade
scheme.

Gavin stressed that no l.chiglt
professors are suspected of bcing
involved with the undcrhandcd
computer dccd.

 

LET THE SUN SHINE
Ecologist Barry Commoner
claims that the Jimmy Carter
Administration is suppressing a

series of federal studies which
indicate that. with propcr
government support. solar-

produccd electricity could soom bc
compclitivc with powcr produced
from fossil fuels and utomiccncrgy.

Commoner is alleging that tltc
l)cpanrncnt of Defense and the
Federal Energy Administration have

drawn up a long-range solar energy
proposal know as “the Federal
Photovotaic Program." According
to the St. Louis scientist.
government researchers have
privately calculated » that an
expenditure of $400 million in
photovotaic units would make solar
energy cost'competitivc with other
forms of electricity by I985.
Commoner claims that the federal
studies conclude that once solar
energy was established with
government secd,moncy. it would
then be able to compete with and
even rcplacc other traditional forms
of power. The scientist charges that
the Carter Administration is keeping
the program sccrcl. partly because. if
established. it would result in serious
competition to the big oil
companies. '
