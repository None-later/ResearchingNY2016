' There is a saying that the outcome
ofthe contest will be decided by the
ﬂip of a coin. That was the case last
Saturday in Canton. N.Y. when the
Albany State varsity football team
dropped a 30-7 contest to the St.
Lawrence Saints in the sciison
opcnei for both squads.

“The game strategy for botti
schools was to win the toss of the
coin. Both schools wanted to start
with the winds it! their brick." said
Albany head coach Robert Ford.
Unfortunately for the Danes. St.
Lawrence won the toss and naturally
elected tovtrike the wind.

Both teams failed to move the brill
on their opening series. On Albany‘s
second possession again they were
stopped and were forced to punt into
the wind. Ed Sellers got off the first
of three short punts in the first
quarter allowing St. Lawrence to
take over with excellent ﬁeld
position.

Sellers. substituting for Mike
Mrirrin who couldn't make the trip.
puiitcd the brill fch yards giving the
Sriints the brill on the Dorics‘ 25.
Four plays later. St. |.rt\vrcncc's
outstanding quarterback. Kirk

Dempsey. went in from the one

giving the Saints their ﬁrst of three

scores in the opening qurirtcr.

Aguin Albany‘s lirrid Aldrich was
unable to move his club rind Sellers
Wits forced to punt; this time for l3
yrirds giving the Sriints the bull on
Albrrny‘s'43, Dempsey got his tcrim

mnnrigc three points out ofthe drive
as Herb Iilock kicked u 31 yard ﬁeld
goal.

After both teams cxchttngcd

Aldrich. but like his predecessor:
was unable to get his tciim going.
SLU took over possession on
Albriny's 15, Two plays ltllcl'. Mrirk
Eldridge scootcd 23 yards for it 17-0
SLU lead.

The first qurirtcr finally ended and
now it was the Dairies turn for the

of the field. bill when you start out

Albany had two more chrinccs to
close SLU's gap. but mistakes
prevented thrit. Faced with it fourth
down and two. the Dunes elected to
go for it on the SLU 35. However. a
bad pitch from Aldrich nullified the
quest.

()n SLU‘s next possession. the
Dunes defense. which played
consistent football tIII day. held SLU
rind forced them to punt. The bike
went over the puntcr‘s head but the
Dunes were unable to trickle him
before he linrilly got the punt off.
“Thrit was it big play for us. Had we
made the trickle. we would Ilich had
good field position.“‘snid Ford.

A surprising statistic in the first
lirill is Albany hrid more total yards
than SLU |2li-| I7. But it wristhc l7-
7 score that counted.

On the first play of the second

“We rirc still too sporridic on offense.
