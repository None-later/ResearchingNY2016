decertltylng the SUNYA Chemistry Pb.D program.

AA UP Report Criticizes
SUN Y Faculty Firings

An investigation of SUNY's I974—
76 retrenchment practices has
pttblished its final report with
findings of widespread
administrative abuse.

The investigation by the American
Association of University Professors
concludes win its' report "that “’th‘e
retrenchments were effected with
“disregard for the rights of tenure.
for dtte notice. for the role of the
faculty. . . [and] have produced a
climate in which academic freedom
is gravely endangered.“

The investigation was sparked by
numerous grievances from
professors complaining on the
mantter in which faculty were laid
off. Another investigation by the
State Assetnbly Higher Education
Committee has scheduled hearings
this Friday in Albany and next
Friday in New York City on those
retrenchments.

According to the report. SUNY‘s
worsening iinanciul situation over
the last few years was used as an
excuse to "strengthen some
programs while others were being

 

 

curtailed or eliminated." The report
added that the “action resulted in an
increase of overall faculty lines
SUNY—widc at tile expense of select
faculty lines."

Questionable Practices

“There seem to be» many
questionable matrices tit Albany."
said one member of the Assembly
committee. She added that “a goodly
number“ of past and present
SUNYA faculty have been risked to
testify at the Assembly committee
hearings. which will be chaired by
Assemblyman Melvin Miller (D-
llrooklyn). A great many of those
asked have agreed to appear before
the committee.

Some 30 faculty were laid off in
SUNYA retrenchments after the
elimination of some 20 degree
programs. Although some of the
retrenched faculty members have
since foundjobs either with SU NYA
or on other academic institutions. a
number have not. Robert Shirley.

The Chemistry Ph. D. program has
been deccrtilicd by the State
Education Department.

.Acting SU NYA President Vincent
O'l.eary said last night that the SED
has decided not to renew
certification of the degree program.
following a report several years ago
by a doctoral review committee
which “conditionally continued“ the
program.

()‘|.eary said he is “not in a
position to speculate" as to the
specifics of the SEl) report.

SUNYA published a “Mission.
Programs. and. Priorities For
Action“ document in July which lists

Chemistry as one of 14 programs
that have “either. . . attained
positions of national leadership
already or ltavethc potential to do so
in a reasonable period of time.“ ’

Each of the three colleges of Ans
and Sciences has now had a central
degree program deccrtii'ied by SED.
although SUNYA has sued SED
over the right to dccertifythe English
and history doctoral programs as it
did two years ago. That case ltas
been appealed following a lower
court‘s ruling in favor of the
dcccrtificalions.

Student Patrol Funding Sought

by Mike Pearlman

. A student security patrol similar
to the one organiyed on campus last
semester. may be established this
year if funding can be found.
according to SA President David
(iold.

An experimental program was
instituted last spring. in which the
Department of Public Safety and a
team ofsludents workedtogether on
a system of student-provided
security.

(iold said funding for a similar
progrnnt this year is currently being
sought.

"We believe there is a lot of tnoney
floating around.“ Gold said.
Department of Public Safety
Director Jim Williams tittd members
of last year's student patrol have
mapped out a strategy for funding
possibilities. Gold said.

i Former student patrolman Paul
Kirkaas Varvay-anis is writing up 11
resolution for funding that he will
submit to Central Council withinthe

    

next two weeks, according to Gold.

Williams said the student patrol
program last semester was a good
ottc. and that ltc would like to see it
funded again this year.

Investigator John Hatter. an
assistant coordinator of the
program. said there are many
reasons why the program should be
rcinstiluied. lie said the student
patrol provided many services that
Would have been impossible to
implement without hiring at least
five additional University Police
officers and using one or two more
patrol curs. Some of the services
provided included student escorts.
watching for fire hazards. and
providing police witlt information in
the event of a problem. he said.

Gold said that funding for the
program last spring was taken from
the parking i'tnc fund but that this
year there have been problems
getting money.

Vice President for Management &
Planning John Hartigan said that

the $3.000-$4.00() spent last year on
the program constituted funds to
launch a pilot project. and that the
Department of Public Safety knew
that as an experimental project it
was only guaranteed funding for a
short time.

“Once we provided the kickoff for
it we were left otit ofit entirely. We
are not budgeted for tltttt kind of
program." Hartigan said.
