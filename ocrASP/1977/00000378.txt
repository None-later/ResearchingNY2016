restored homes and i0 brand-new

 greenhous s' will warm up with an

' unusual solar energy system.

’ Among those cheering will be
Valerie Pope. 44 years old. who six
years ago Was a straggling welfare
mother and who now heads one of
the most imaginative and vigorous
self-help organizations in any high-
crime. low-income ttrban
community; and Nate Rekoslt. 65. a
'retired aerospace engineer. who
helped launch the United States
missile program and who is now
pioneering what is probablythe first
solar project intended to serve urban
poor people.

The central heat and hot water
system conceived by Rekosh is
designed to do several things: lower
utility bills for homeowners ofthe l0
buildings. help them grow healthy
food economically. upgrade a
neighborhood and create jobs for
previously unemployable people.

When Pope and Reitosh first
sought funds for it. they met with
rebuffs from grunt-dispensing
officials accustomed to hearing from
large firms and institutions. not from
predominantly black community
groups like theirs. the West Side

Community Development Corp.
(CDC).
littt their persistence finally

sprang loose some start-up money.
which led to more. Now they are
reaping praise from city. sttttc and
federal ofﬁcials who see Rekosh‘s
design as possibly adaptable to
public. subdivision and military
housing.

The l0solar heated homes. among
hundreds that the Veterans
Administration and Federal
Housing Administration had
repossessed in the neighborhood.
have been rehabilitated. and are
ready to go on the market as
reasonably priced shelter. They have
sparked further upgrading in the
area.

The former convicts. pttrolecs and
other outcasts who worked on the
homes and solar system as trainees in
a program for thejobless are on their
way up tojobs paying up to $7.50 an
hour. And the development firm is

about to embark on broad and

 

 t all began with economic
necessity. mixed with some rare
imagination and drive.

Eight years ago. Pope was
struggling to rear her three children
on welfare in this city of l00.000
where the job market htts been
depressed for years rind
unemployment of minority youths is
about 40 per cent. In the process. she
and Sharon Cooper. a mother of
live. led the formation of a welfare
rights group that fought for jobs,
school integration and more fairness
in public aid programs.

The abundance of vacant.
vandalized houses in the area offered
a chance for concrete action. The
homes had been built for employees
of Norton Air Force Base and the
local electronics industry. But in
I958. after majorjob cutbacks. most
were sold to black families in fast-
buck operations. without adequate
credit ttnd income checks. Most of
the homes soon reverted to banks.
the FHA and the VA. Some had
been sold several times again. and
finally abandoned.

Pope and Cooper persuaded the
VA to make their newly fortned firm
the broker-managers of 20 of these

- properties. “It was the first time the
[VA had ever done such a thing“.

Cooper said. The VA agreed to
provide money for materials.

A month of picketing and a triple

grant from the federal
Comprehensive Employment and
Training Act. a job training
progrttrn. Richard Cole. a black
general contractor who specialized
in rehabilitation projects. took
charge of the job. 'l'hi city provided
administrative stall.

The group set high standards:
"i’oor people don't have tnortey for
upkeep.“ Cooper said. “ We decided
plumbing had to be better than
ttsttsal. All pain! had to be washable.
Roofs ltad to last. lttsulution had to
be good."

Spending $3000 to $7000 on each
four-bedroom. two-bath housc.the
group put them into shape and sold
them at an average of $|0.250 each.
They are now worth $lll.000. bttt
no new owner has sold.

At his point. Nate Rekosh walked
in. He had grown restless fishing and
tending roses during two years of
retirement. Over a long and diverse
career with the space program. the
missile program and the Army
Corps of Engineers. Rekosh had
accumulated knowledge he wanted

counseling in case of ﬁnancial stress.

It was intheeounseling—intrytng
to help families stretch tight incomes
to the utmost—that Pope hit on the
solar power idea. She looked at a
collector someone had built as an
experiment. but found it too ugly. “I
had read that people were ﬁghting
solar as detracting from the value of
property." she said. "So I knew we
had to build it so it would add to

walked over to see i’ope. He was
soon hard at work on the solar

gardener. they decided to place the
truncated

roofs of a string of connecting
greenhouses. The water tank. big

The system was designed to work
as a closed loop. storing water in the
5000-gallon tank. ready to be
pumped into the homes as needed.

getting the cold shoulder from their
talking refrigerator these day.

A Palatine. Illinois. woman has
invented what she cailsia “dicter‘s
conscience.“ a small white box
installed in your refrigerator that
literally reads you the riot act
whenever you open the door.

When the door is opened. a trigger
is released on a small tape-recorder
in the device. and a raucous voice
yells “You eating again? No wonder
you‘re getting fat." Then the voice
adds. in the same insulting tone:
“Close the door. it‘s getting warm."

The message ends with peals of
insane laughter which. according to
the inventor. are enough to make
you slam the refrigerator door and
run for cover. '

The inventor. Carol Kiclbala. says
she got the idea for the mocking
refrigerator laughs because the

conscience also has a terrible laugh.
Kielbala says in three weeks. she lost
eight pounds just trying to avoid
opening her own refrigerator.

COMPUTER SCHEME '
~ A special agent with the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administrationp the
DEA. has been charged with using
the drug agency's super-secret
computer system in efforts to set up
his own fool-proof drug smuggling
scheme.

An indictment against special
DEA agent Paul Lambert has been
handed down by a federal grand jury
in New Haven. Connecticut.

The indictment accuses Lambert
of secretly obtaining printouts from
the DEA's data processing system.
known as the “Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs Information
System. or “NADDIS” for short.

Lambert is accused of
masterminding major marijuana
and cocaine smuggling plots by
using the computer to tell him
exactly where DEA and customs
border patrols_ would be at cenain

printouts also allegedly _told_the/
special agent the names of all
undercover drug informants to be
avoided and even the names of major
drug buyers inthc United States who
were likely to become solid

Lambert. who has pleaded not
guilty to the charges. hits been
suspended from the DEA without

VAMPIRE HOTLINE

In this era ol'shortagcs. it may be a
little scary to know that there
reportedly are no shortages of
vampires at all.

in fact. there are said to be so
many vampires running around the
country. trying to suck blood from
their victims. that a New York City
parupsyehologist has set up aspecial
vampire hotline.

Doctor Stephen Kaplan. author
of “in pursuit of Premature Gods
and Contemporary Vampires." says
that most people are really vampires.
that is. that at some time or another
they have sucked blood from a cut or
scratch.

Some folks. the doctor says.
however. suddenly begin to develop
a special taste for blood and crave it
so much they will even kill for it.
Kaplan estimtttes there are at least
l0.000 to 20.000 blood-sucking
people in the U.S. and hundreds of
thousands around the world.

Kaplan is asking. seriously folks.
for anyone who is a vampire. knows
one. or thinks she or he has been
bitten in a rather unusual fashion. to

Kaplan said. predictably enough
that the incidence of vampirism rim.
dramatically around this time. of
year. and peaks shortly after
Halloween.

' ILLEGAL PAVOFFS

Federal investigators are reported
to have uncovered evidence of mob
pay-offs and extortion inside the
U.S. Marshals service.

Long Island‘s Newsday
newspaper reports that a quiet
internal investigation of the
marshals office has already resulted
in a series of forced resignations by
U.S. marshals and top deputies in at
least four cities. The newspaper adds
that at least one indictmerit has
already been handed down. and
more indictments against marshals
and deputies are expected.

The most serious allegations.
according to Newsday. are coming
out of Newark. New Jersey. where
members of the marshals office are
accused of receiving cash pay-offs
from known organived critne
figures.

One of the principal
responsibilities of the marshals
service is known as lllL‘ “Federal
Witness Protection Program.“
Under this program. U.S. marshals
are assigned the duties of protecting
major witnesses and providingthem
with new identities if necessary.
usttally in organich crime cases.

Newsday says there is cvtdence
that mobsters were being given
inside inlortnation on the

movements of protected witnesses
