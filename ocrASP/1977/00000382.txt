Ry BRIAN CAHILL
And RICHIE MERMELS‘I‘EIN

Everyone has some gripe with an aspect of
SUNYA. Be it the bathrooms outside of the
bowling alleys. the long lines at check cashing.
or the endless hike to quad parking lots.
Sometimes people merely state their
complaint aloud and let it linger in the moist
Albany air. Others. who think in constructive
terms. announce. “What this school needs
is..." or “Wouldn‘t it be nice if...“

50. in BRAINES GAME No. 2. we’re
opening up a suggestion box. Tell us what to
do with our university. using either the
aforementioned beginnings or paraphrasals of
those words. Strive to make them more
creative than “What this school needs is toilet
paper dispensers in campus center
bathrooms." and a little subtler than “What
this school needs is on SA president who ties
babies to hotplates." which has become
overused and hockneyed.
