co-op stipends

To the Editor:

In reference to your editorial on Sept. to.
some points must be clariﬁed.

It was not this year‘s SA Executive Branch-
that made the decision to cut out all stipends
except those of SA leaders. Last year's SA
President and Budget Committee made the
decision. The way Student Association works
is that the previous year‘s administration sets
the budget. while this year‘s Executive Branch
must work with it.

The decision to give stipends to the
managers of the record co-op was made this
summer. It was felt that if we were to give
students the opportunity to buy a wide variety
of inexpensively priced records. it must be
well-organized and efficiently run. We also
believe that with such large amounts of
goods and money changing hands (2.300
dollars in l2 hours) it is vital that there always
be someone in a position of responsibility
present. We were determined not to begin our
record co-op half-assed.

But regardless of the controversy. the

‘ record co-op has proven to be a smashing

success. This' was due primarily to the hard

' work of those involved. There will be a contest

soon. to choose a name for the record co—op.
since it is not in the true sense. a co—op. The
ASP must be thanked for all the free publicity
that it gavetothe co-op. Now almost everyone
knows that there is a record co-op.

The ASP is right in arguing that a
comprehensive stipend policy must be
developed. I am confident that Central

end to this mess. .

cheerleader cheers

To the Editor:

I want to take the time to bring to the
attention of the readers ofthe A SPa tributeto
the cheerleaders of Albany State. Those of you
who were unable to trek to“no man‘s land" on
Saturday to see the Great Dane football team
play St. Lawrencein Canton. N.Y..did not see
the poise and mature style in which nine loyal
women represented the State University of
New York at Albany. Had you been there. I
believe you wouldjoin me in being very proud
of them.

Without going into great detail. but to
provide background. let me say that the
cheerleaders put a lot of effort into obtaining
rides for the four hour tripto Canton and the
tedious trip home. they worked very hard
throughout the game. and let the football
players feel that they were not completely
alone on the visitor's side of the field. The
cheerleaders were subjected to open ridicule
periodically throughout the game by several.
obviously immature St. Lawrence college
"men" disguised in the regular S.L.U.
cheerleaders‘ sweaters. 'l‘liese
"representatives" of St. Lawrence University
were unbelievably rude and a total discredit to
what is "supposedly" a class institution. NUl
only were they disrespectful to other human
beings. and to cheerleading in general. they
displayed complete disregard for other‘s
leelings. and they could have very easily
caused injury to at least one of the girls. The
behavior ol'thcsc St. Lawrence "cheerleaders"
was despicable and completely uncalled for.

In light of all this. however. the Albany
State Cheerleaders handled the situation in
exceedingly good taste and poise. They
maintained their composure and made the
best of it trying predicament. My
congratulations to all ofthcm for a superjob.l
sincerely thank them.

escape, Chemistry‘s Ph. D. program disappeared. _ . .

This time. it was not Fields who had done the cutting, but the State
Education Department, in a fit of de-certiﬁcation fever — a rather
contagious disease that has already ravaged the History and English
departments.

Chemistry appeared to be well protected. lts undergraduate, masters
and doctoral programs were all listed in the Mission Statement as items
to be supported and sustained; the department was also described later
on in that same document as one of the programs “either having attained
positions of national leadership or having the potential to do so in a
reasonable period of time.“

But SU NYA's newly defined Mission seems to be far from the concern
of the SED. Whether it proposes to mold SUNYA into a university
center of its own imagining, or is merely ﬂexing muscles after its recent
court victory remains to be seen.

What is clear is that this open warfare between the state and the state
university cannot continue. It is not the role of the SED to strike
indiscriminately at academic programs; nor is it the place of a university
center to be forced to fight for its curriculum in court.

Whatever the outcome, it can only do damage in the long run tothe
principal obligations of this university (as stated in the Mission): a
commitment to the discovery and advancement of knowledge. and a
commitment to the teaching of students.

Centering the Center

The Campus Center is certainly in need of both space reallocation and
reconstruction. With tenants ranging from a radio station. to a
newspaper, to administrative offices. the pillars and standardized
cubicles of this structure simply cannot meet all needs efficiently.

Edward Durell Stone’s architecture does have the potential for
efficient space usage, hOWever. as the recent renovation of the
administration building has proved. The Campus Center could beneﬁt
greatly from similar measures.

The building must be reorganized as a unit, not simply on a room by
room basis as has been done in the past. .

Careful thought must also be given to the concept ofthe building— it
is. in more thanjust name, the center of this campus, and efforts should
be made to increase its effectiveness in that direction.

And special consideration must go to the off campus students. who
have no other home on this white wonderland than the quads in
exchange for more office space, and this university becomes that much
colder for those who have nothing but classes to draw them here.

 

Losing the Green Buses

by David Gold and Kathy Baron

The green buses are not safe yet. The
Division ofthe Budget is still pushing for us to
put our John Hancock on that much talked
about contract. There are still many details
that need to be worked out and some problems
that CDTA must address itself to,

There will be very little bus service on
Washington. This will cause hardship for
those students living off-campus on the
Washington Avenue side. Willi housing as
limited as it is in Albany and on-campus. we
cannot expect students to be able to find
apanmcnts near Western Avenue and it is
therefore the State‘s and the University‘s
responsibility to provide adequate
transportation for all students.

Students will have to show their ID cards
before boarding the buses. This isjust another
inconvenience for everyone,

Unless there is a clause in the contract for a
committee composed of students and
Administrators to oversee the buses. we will
lose any control we presently have over this
service.

The layover at Alumni Quad will no longer
be in effect because SUNYA students will be
sharing the buses with the normal community
riders.

We Cannot expect the CDTA drivers to wait
for students running to catch the bus because
this will inconvenience the regular paying

customers. '
If we sign with CD'l'A and the contract is

not lived up to. we will not be able to revert
back to our present service because the green
buses will be in Stonybrook.

The SUNYA bus drivers will be offeredjobs
with CDTA. however. regardless of how long
thcv have worked. they will have no seniority
in CDTA when they transfer.

The final decision on the CDTA issue will
not be made by the committee with students
on it. this is only an advisory committee.

Under our present system the President of
the University may order extra buses to cover
high traffic times. this power must also exist in
any contract made with CDTA.

CDTA has never won a bid for bus service
with the University; such as the weekend bus
service. because other companies have offered
the same service at a lower cost.

We are still perplexed asto whythe Division
of the Budget wants to hand our bus service
over to a company that is 5500.000 in debt.

In an effort to get answers to these
questions. and any others you may have, there
will be open hearings to discuss the possible
CDTA takeover of our bus service. The first
one will beheld on Tuesday. Sept. 20 at 7 pm.
in the Alumni Quad Cafeteria and the second
one will be held Monday. Sept. 26 at 2 pm. in
the Campus Center Ballroom. Both the
Student UnioniLing Movement and your
Central Council Representatives have put
pressure on to get these hearing. The bus issue
is one that affects almost every student and we
urge your attendance at these hearings.
