to be involved in it a long time.

Last Sat'urday's jayvee. soccer
game was signiﬁcant for two
reasons; It was the start of regular
season play for the team. and it also
marked the debut of coach Johnny
Rolando. Unfortunately for the
Danes. this_ debut was spoiled by
RPI. who defeated the Danes 2-l on
Albany‘s home ﬁeld.

Albany came out aggressively as

the game began. The well organized ,

Dane offense went right to work
applying pressure and controlling
the ball in the RPI end. This
aggressiveness soon payed off as
forward Eugene Haber broke
through a crowd in front ofthe RPI
goal and drilled a shot into the left
corner of the net for a l-0 Albany
lead.

 

“2.1

 

.T he " second half began' with
Albany again taking the initiative on
offense.

Then suddenly. the RPI offense
opened up and began to test Dane
goalie Fidel Castro. After a
defensive breakdown by Albany,
RPl's Keith Murphy tied the game
with a goal that dribbled past Castro
and into the net to make the score I-

' I.

RPI‘s Alex lvanov booted it high
line drive past a helpless Castro and
into the right corner of the net. This
proved to bethe winning goal as RPI
earned a hard-fought 2-I victory.

The coach felt that the whole team
played well. and be singled out right
wing David Goldberg and right
fullback Luis Arango as having
exceptional games.

In the words of Robert Ford. bead
coaclt of the Albany State varsity
football team. “we nltlnlttlfldlcd
them.“

Ford was referring to the Great
Danes‘ Iii-3 victory over Sotltherll
Connecticut last Saturday at New
Haven.

It was ll game where Alblllry
completely dominated botll the
offensive and defensive lines in the
first victory of' the season.

“This was the first time in my eight
years collcllitrg here where we
mltnbtlndlcd botll lines of the
superior si7c." said an elated Ford.
Both 'lllL‘ ()lvls‘ lines averages over
220 pounds.

One problem the I)a nus have had
this year is mounting an offensive
attack. Bill Saturday there was no
problem with the offense. The
runnillg backs. with the help of the
ol'lenisvc line. accumulated 3|] of
Albany‘s 372 total offensive yards.

Fullback Mike Mirabella led the
way with 77 years in IS curries Willi
one touchdown. Right behind him
were running backs Sam llltllhltltl
and Glen Sowalskic with 73 yards
each. Haliston‘s efforts earned him
tllc most valuable offensive brick
lllvllrd.'l'lte story of'tlre day however.
was Albany‘s defensive play.

“()ur defense played the most
lccltttlcally sound game I‘ve ever
seen since I‘ve been here.“ said Ford.
Albany held the Owls to I43 tolle
yards and six first downs.

 Perhaps the oiltstundllrg stallstlc
ol the game was the II sticks
Albany's defense recorded on Ioln
l‘ltlllL‘l’l)’. the ()wl's quarterback.
the II .sllclts set It school record and
lltc of those sucks were recorded by
dclcrrslte tackle Stcvc Slloclr. who

also set a record.
llill Mathis. the other defensive
tackle. accounted for four slicks.

Mathis and Shocn. who were
named most \‘tllllllhlL‘ def'enslvc
linemen. tllso combined for 42‘

tackles.

Albany got on the sdorcboard first
when Mirabella scootcd 22 yards
into the end zone with 6:06 left in the
first period. llrucc (‘htlrclrwcll then
added the two-point conversion.

IIrlld Aldrich. the Danes‘
quarterback started that drive from
his own 42 when he hit Scott Lushcr
with lllr ll yard puss. then he
connected for it 23 yard puss to
Sowalskic before Mirabella full for
the score.

In the second quarter. botll learns
traded field goals. Albany's Larry
Licbowit/ connected otl ll 25-yard
field goal giving Albany an I l-(llead.
Then the Owl‘s Jim Satagaj gave his
team three points with his field goltl.
Albany completed the day's scoring
in the third period when Sowalskie
carried the ball ill from the Owl's
l'our. climaxlng a 50-yard drive.

Aldrich played more Illtlll hall the
game and completed follr of nine
passes for 5‘) yards. He also gained
55 yards on the grotlnd. “()ttr
