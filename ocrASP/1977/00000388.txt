according to UAS general manager
E. Norbert Zahm.

“The last three or four years we
have tried to have our annual
meeting in September.“ said Zalim.
“This year we are late because SA
had to have an audit which they have
not had the couple ofprevious years.
So. we delayed our audit three
weeks.“

0n the agenda for next month's
meeting is an election ol‘the I977-78

evaluation of last year‘s programs
from a financial standpoint.

SA President David Gold said.
“There is a much more active board
this year. We will meet about twicea
month. I would like to see every
student member work on a specific
problem." . .

Presently. an executive committee
comprised of those members from
the l976—77 board who were in
Albany during the summer is
functioning forthe [977-78 board of
