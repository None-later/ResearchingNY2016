, arrangements can be made within

specific situations'will fit the criteria
fer retrenchment.

,Using himself as an example.
Solnick testified that he Was being
assigned courses and times designed
to limit enrollment. sothat if bis‘timc
for retrenchment comes. the
administration will have a case
against him.

Solnick attributed much of'this to
his close working relationship with
students. Drawing a supportive
round of applause from other
faculty. Solnick stated. “The further
one is removed from dealing with
students. the safer _is one‘s job."
Soliiick iilso said that a personal

conflict with the dean is a source of

his problems.

 

mi. Louis Ismay of" SUNYA's
Environmental Studies program
testified that 589.000 had been
apportioned for environmental
studies in the Supplemental Budget.
He said he is not sure exactly where
the money went. Assemblyman
Miller said his staff would look into
the matter. The money. accordingto
lsamy. was released and receiVed in
the last couple of weeks. but plans
were never miide to use it even
though the administration knew it
was coming before then. Since the
environmental program is multi-
disciplinary in nature. the money
could go to any of a number of
departments. iiceording to Ismay.

headache.“ r .

"The decisions were necessary for
budget reasons and for future

considerations.“ said SUNYA Vice

President for Academic Affairs
David Mtirtin. “The fiscal situation
is worsening and it was felt that the
resources were spread toothin. High
cost and lowenroilment were factors
(for retrenchment)."

Martin also said that manyfaculty
members were not trained for other
departments. and therefore could
itot be relocated.

retrenchment shotildybe made by a
committee. not by-the President
alone. SUNYA [student/Robert
Hirsb said thtit’ the school’is
becomming a . [ire-professional
institution. not a l‘ull'university
center offering a liberal education.

Throughout the hearing
Assemblyman Miller asked the
witnesses about any solutions or
suggestions thaey had for dealing
with retrenchment problems.
Political Science Prof. Clifford
Brown expressed the view of many
faculty by suggesting that an
external agency from the Regents be
created to review cases of
retrenchment. He called on the
legislature to enact a statuteto create
such an agency.

.Iohnpoll proposed even more
extensive measures. He said that all
SUNY colleges and universities
should become independent from
each other. with no large central
administration. similar tothe system
in the province of Ontario.

Many of those testifying were

time and non-tenured faculty were
kept before tenured people. In their
view this is If violation of their
contracts.

Dr. Morris Hudin of United
University Professions. the union
which represents SUNY faculty.
summed tip the general feeling of
most of' the faculty: “Who or what
gets ctit still retains a political
flavor.“

Assemblyman Miller will chair
another meeting concerning
retrenchment in New York City
Friday.

"We will prepare a detailed report
and then look into the charges.“ said
Miller. "We can‘t just jump on this.“

Vincent Cowling said there have
been “substantial increases in the
funding of research“ in that
department since the initial Slil)
review.

“Ilic level of external funding in
the Chemistry Department has risen
from roughly 3300.000 in I97J-74 to
about 5600.000 this year. These
funding grants are based on national
competition. so to increase your
landing at this time is an
extraordinary accomplishment." Itc
