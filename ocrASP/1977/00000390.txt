GOVERNMENT ISSUE
The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. in a surprise move
last fall. began ‘ supplying a
Washington. DC. teacher named
Robert Randall with a stcadysupply
of Government-Produced
marijuana cigarettes.

Randall suffers from the eye
disease. Glaucoma; the pot was
given to him after he filed suit
against the government contending
that smoking marijuana wasthe only
effective treatment for his desease.
He argued that marijuana would
save his eyesight.

A Washington Federtil Judge also
ruled last ftill' in Randall's favor.
stating that Randall had a
constitutional right to his eyesight.
and this right should override the
government‘s ability to deprive him
of the drug.

In recent months. however. the
government has been moving
against Randall once again. The 29-
year-old teacher has received word
from the Drug Enforcement
Administration that he is subject to
arrest. even though the marijuana he
is receiving and using is being
handed out by another branch ofthc

government.

The D. E.A., in a letterto Randall.
warned him that a review of Federal
Codes indicates that doctors who
conduct pot research are immune
from prosecution: however
added that “persons who are the
subjects of such research“ may still
be prosecuted.

Randall has not yet been arrested.
He has been informed. however. that
instead of being given weekly
supplies of marijuana. as was the
case for six months. he will be given
enough pot for just one day of
treatment at a time.

He alleges that all ofthis is being
done to stop him from speaking out
on marijuana issues. He reports he
traveled over 9000 miles in the
month of May. speaking at Drug
Abuse conferences arotind the US.
supporting marijuana reform laws.

He says that upon his return to
Washington. he was told he must
pick up his marijuana each day.
rather than weekly. This he claims.

MCDONALD’S MATH

Should children in' public schools
be taught math by learning to count
such things as “Twinkies” and “Baby
Ruth“ candy bars?

A Sacramento. California-based
group called Vigilance in Public
Education is protesting the fact that
a new math book designed for
elementary grade school children
features junk food to illustrate its
lessons.

One of the Vigilance in Public
Education lenders. Barbara Ericson.
reports that young children are
taught how to count by being shown
a picture of the Hostess Cream-
Fillcd cupcake. and then they are
asked “how manytwinkies comein a
package?“ Ericson contends that.

KICK THE HABIT

A Virginia Speech Specialist is
reporting that Americans have
adopted a nasty speaking habit... A
habit that has replaced the
traditional “‘AHS“ and “ERS” that
have punctuated speaking pauses for
years.

Florenz Hinz says the new
expression is “Y‘KNOW.”
According to the 67-year-old
Alexandria consultant. the phrase
" Y‘know“ has become so common in
American speech over the past l0
years it is “endemic“ nationwide.

Him says that one analysis of a
recent televised speech delivered by a
Harvard Graduate found the phrase
"Y‘know" popped tip about every
[54th or |4th word. lIinI claims the
expression is used because people
olten talk beloretheytbitik. andtbcy
tisc it to pause while they gatltcrtheir
thoughts.

Hin/ reports he has developed a
method to cure habitual "Y‘know"
users. IIe s is he plans to open up
what he calls "No-ll-No“ centers
across American to help people kick
the “Y‘know” habit.

QUALITY RECORDS

A number ot stereo equipment
manufacturers as well as rock
musictans have _ltl|llL‘tl the ranks of
people who are attacking lite quality
of today‘s record albutns.

Recently. both cashbox and
billboard iiiaga/incs quoted record
iiholesulers and retailers as
complaining that the proportion of
delccliic albums reaching the
market today luiie reached all-time
highs. sortie record-sellers estimate
that as litany as h’t) percent of all new
albums. or loiir in every five. are
either warped or detective III other
ways. .Ion Kelly til the audio-
techtiica corporation says that the
quality ol records is lagging so far
behind advances in audio equipment
that his company will be giving oitt
“Audio liscelleiice“ awards to the
lew companies that make good
records. Kelly says he hopes the
auartl will encourage at least some
record companies to think tnore
about quality when pressing new
records. Ihc main reasons gncn tor
the inciease in delcctiie ulbtims is

  

that companies are using interior
"recycled" \itin to “It” out records
and that the) are iuslHelcasitig
