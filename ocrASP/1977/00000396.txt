Saturday. for its second'victory of
the season against one loss. ‘

. For the second straight week. the
Danes‘ offense ran over their
opponent's line. Last week against
Southern Connecticut, they ran for
3i] yards. Saturday. they increased
that 'total to 4|? yards. with 299 of
those coming :in the first half when
Albany jumped to a 25-7 lead.

Most \aluablc flat-its

Two men responsible for more
than half of the 4!? yards were
running backs (ilen Sowalskic and
Sam Haliston. Sowalskie rushed for
bill yards on 21 carries while
Haliston gathered I40 on I7 carries
\iith two touchdowns. Both were
named after the game as most
valuable offensive backs,

do it by themselves. Albany‘s front
line blocked extremely well for the
ttvo. “()ur offensive line played very
_ well. They did It real good job." said
a pleased Albany coach. Robert
Ford.
Albany won the opening toss and
elected to receive the ball. 'l'heir
opening series gave the firockport

' Eagles a taste of what- was to come
the. rest of the afternoon. _‘

Starting on their own 27. Albany
quarterback Brad Aldrich drove his
'te'am 50 yards before his second pass
of the day was intercepted by the
Eagle‘s Steve Murphy on the 25-yard
line. Murphy ran a few yards before
flipping it to his teammate Tom
Cauley who scooted 75 yards down
the sideline and into the endzone for
a 1-0 Brockport lend. .

The lead held up through the first
quarter but in the second quarter.
Albany was finally able to cross the
goal line. In fact they crossed itthree
times and also .added a field goal
within an eight minute span.

'l'he Dancs‘ first score came after
.I on Simpson partially blocked
Iiroekport‘s fourth down punt.
enabling Albany to take over on the
Eagle‘s 38.

()n the next play. Mike Mirabella
scored the first of his two
touchdowns on It two-yard plunge.
Albany added the two-point
conversion giving them the lead for
good.

The Albany defense held
iirockport again. as it did all day.
forcing them to punt. Starting on
their own I4 yard line. Aldrich
engineered an lib-yard scoring drive

in eleven plays. culminating with a,

- Mirabella score-

Larry Leibowitz kicked the PAT.
for a i5-7 Albany lead. The big plays
in that drive were a 23-yard pass
from Aldrich to split end Steve
Lusbcr and a f5-yard run by
Sowalskie.

The Eagles again couldn't muster
tip any offensive attack and were
forced to punt. 0n Albany's first
play. Halistontook a handoff from
Aldrich and raced 49 yards into the
cndzonc. adding It dance. Leibowitz‘
PA‘f' was good and Albany led 22-7,
with a little more than two minutes
to go in the half.

Hrockport. looking to get its
offense on track. was forced to the
air. But that too went for naught.
Defensive back Rtiyiiay picked off
Karl Ulrich‘s pass and returned it 20
yards to the Brockport Iii. Four
plays later. Leibowit'l. kicked a 3f-
yard field goal giving the Danestheir
‘25-7 halftime lead.

kickoff on the ten and proceeded to

At this point. Coach Ford decided
to replace Aldrich with Fred

Harriers Upset Syracuse 21-36

by Rich Sellgstin

When one reflects over the sport
of cross country. the individual. not
the team. comes to mind. . But
Albany State‘s cross country squad
should begin to change that type of
thinking.

Most evidence can come from
Saturday's meet at West Point
versus Army and Syracuse. where a
true team effort by the Danes
enabled them to defeat the

()ratigemcii for the first tinte iit five
tries. 2l-36.

Albany also dropped a IS-alti
decision to a strong Army squad. but
the victory over Syracuse more than
made up for their first defeat of the
season.

The Dane‘s record now stands at
(H. compared to I-b at ihisjuncture
last season. Ont: of'tbe main reasons
for their success this fall is that they
are using team strategy. and not just
running for individual

crformanccs.

   
   

One statistic from Saturday‘s
meet which proves this is the time
spread between Albany's first five
runners: 25 seconds separated their
first five barriers. and 4f seconds
their first seven. “That really paid
off." said coach Robert Munsey.
“We‘re more of a 'team‘ than any
team in our to year history.“

What Munsey called "a fantastic
win for us“ was aided in his opinion
by a costly mistake by the
Orangeme'n. Army set an extremely
fast pace on their rain-soaked five
mile course (“ We‘ve never been there
without a downpour.“). and
Syracuse decided to go out with
them.

Albany was content to stay behind
as a team at the outset. but started
"picking up“ iit the two-mile mark.

“At two and a half miles we were
in a good position." said Munsey.
"Then we started picking off the
Syracuse runners." The Orangemen
find run out of gas in tryingto match

' "the Chemistry PhD program has
been terminated by SUNYA. acting
President Vincent

I announced 'f‘ttcsday.

" .In a statement to faculty. 0‘l.eary
said that a special committee
appointed by the (irtiduate
Academic Cotiiicil had concluded
that the program “would not at this
time meet fully the standards
presently required of a doctoral
program in the State of New
York. . ." -

The program was in the midst ol'a
review by the State Education
Department after receiving a
“provisional continuance“ rating by
the state thrcc ycttrs ago.

On Monday. O‘lciiry received the
final report from an SEI) Rating
Committee on the program. At a
University Senate Meeting last
Monday. ()'|.eary termed the Slit)
committee‘s preliminary report as
“not favorable."

In ()‘lcttry's statement to the
faculty. he said that the chemistry
program lititl not met New York

State doctoral program standards
“particularly with respect to
numbers of senior faculty mid

O'l.eary .

numbers of qualified graduate

students.“

“In many states. this would have
been rated fin excellent chemistry
program." said 0‘I.cary. “However.
it‘s being compared to universities in
New York State only. The doctoral
program could be in the top 20 per
cent in the country bill that doesn‘t
make a difference. It is being
compared to an ideiili/ed. first rate
institution.“

"It‘s an acceptable Plil) program
right now." said Chemistry
Department Chairman Anthony
Snttirno. “I could probably get a
panel of experts to say this is a
quality program right now."

Snttirno called the decision
“basically unfair to the program."
andsnid the department would have
needed more money to meet the
criticisms raised by the Sill).

“'l'his department was examined
by a set of criteria which were
extremely high.“ Saturiio said.

Saturno said that one ofthe points
mentioned in the Sfif) review was
that there are an insufficient number
of high quality Phl) students in the
program. He said that graduate
student stipends made available to
the department were “competitively

  

inadequate“ to those offered by‘
other universities. making it difficult
to draw better students to the
program. '

This year. graduate stipend fines
offered by the department were'
raised from $2800 to $3300.
according to Assistant to the
President .I. l-"rcdcricks Volkwc'tn.

“This year. stipend levels were
raised.“ said Sattirno.
“Unfoitunately. that was too late."

"that fact that chemistry was on
pro\ isioniil status didn‘t make it easy
in terms of recruiting leading
scholars.“ said ()‘lcary. “'l‘hey did
make progress in terms of senior
faculty. btit apparently not
enough."

When the Slil) began its doctoral
review in W74. History and
Chemistry were the first programs at
SUNYA to come under review. At
that time. SEI) terminated the
History program and put the
Chemistry program on the
provisional continuance status.

"The chemistry program was a
very young program and it just
happened to be t he first one to come
under review.“ said O‘I.eary. A PhD
program takes time to develop: liken

nurturing. the clock we live by.
