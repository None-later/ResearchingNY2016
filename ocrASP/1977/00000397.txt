Reverse Discrimination

lhc case deals witii thc coticcpt ol'
"revcisc discrimination" and the
present practice by some college

'lhe case has created it" uproar
among civil rights and education
leaders. The Supreme Court was
petitioned not to lieiirthc link kc case
on the grounds that it did not
provide it solid test case to argue the
quota system.

“I r 'tilly don‘t know wluit kind oi
decision the Supreme (‘ourt will
make." said SUNYA Allirmutivc
Action Director Rosemary Sabin.
"ll tltcy limit their decision to only
admissions based on race. l don't
really think it will allch us."

Yet in it “l'riciid ot the Court"
bi'icl. the ll.S. .lttsticc Department
urged that the Court deal only with
the narrow question ol \vhetlici ii
state uniicrstty may take race into
account to remedy the cllccts oi

test case to argue minority quotas.

“It's impossible to respond
directly to the problems that exist."
said SUNY Assistant Vice
Chancellor lor Allirmutivc Action
Dolores Schmidt. “ll you are found
to discriminate. the Federal
gmcrnmcnt cuts till your tunds. Yet
on the other hand yoti can‘t directly
use race as a criteria lor admitting or

this philosophy becomes evident
when one reads the Justice
Departiiienl‘s briel'. While the

concept that disadvantaged

be given special consideration in
