The Federal Trade‘Commission is
reportedly investigating the ITI‘
Corporation for possible deceptIVe
advertising in the company's
marketing of a product called
“tiberbread.” .

In case you don‘t know.

iiberbread is a loaf of bread baked by ,

ITT which contains a high
percentage of“powdered cellulose" —
or. if you will. "sawdust."

The Wood-based baked goods.
which are being marketed under the

name “Fresh Horizons.“ are‘

supposed to contain fewer calories
and more roughage than your
ordinary loaves of bread.

The Canadian Government has
banned the product because of its
wood-pulp ingredients.

The FTC is reportedly concerned
that the labeling on the "Fresh
Horizons“ package might just. be a
little deceptive. That‘s because the
label on the package contains the
word "wheat." displayed
prominently across a wheatiield that
is being harvested. It describes the
ingredients in smaller type. saying
that the plant fiber in the bread is
“finely powdered food grade
ccllulosc...similar to that found in
fruits. vcgtables and common
foods."



The FTC says that the packaging
doesn‘t make it clear to “ Fresh
Horizons“, buyers that what they are
purchasing is indeed similar to
powdered sawdust. FTC
investigators suggest it might not be
legal to call the product “bread.”

.In a letter to its members. the
Council asserts that Skyhorse and
Mohawk. two t'ormer American
lndian movement leaders. are. in
effect. being framed by the
government. .

The Council claims that the
prosecution has no physical evidence
with which to charge Skyhorse and
Mohawk. It further charges that
three individuals who were
apprehended at the scene of the
murder. reportedly with
bloodstained hands. have been
bribed by the prosecution into
testifying against the two men.

The Council says that one
prosecution witness. caught at the
scene of the crime has since reeieved
a scholarship to college. a part-time
job on a U.S. Navy base. and lives
rent-free in an apartment owned by
the father of another prosecution
witness found at the scene of the
cri.e.

The Council charges that
Skyhorse and Mohawk are victims
of a lramc-up bythe FBI and other
st ate and local’ agencies.
