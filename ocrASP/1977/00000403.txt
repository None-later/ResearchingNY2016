IRAINES GAME NUMBER 3
I As you must have noticed. SUNYA is
experiencing budget cuts. They're laying all
faculty and stall". cutting programs right and

kit etc. Pretty soon. it‘ll get to the point where

they'll have to close up shop and sell the place.
Now. who in the world is going to want to buy
a university whole‘.’ Especially one with near-
zip heritage like this one? They‘ll haveto sell it
piece by piece. Our Bullies Game this round
is: what and to whom can they sell the pieces ol‘
this university, after they‘ve taken it apart?

For instance. you could pawn the podium
oil on an aspiring Samson emulator. Or. you
could probably sell the spaghetti dinner you
had last night on campus to channel 6 as a test
pattern. '

Honestly. we have nothing against corporate cavalry
We regard it with ali’cction. It's a quaint anachronism. Like royalty
in American beer slogans. ~
But. to nit pick for a moment. we ve bee
years longer. And age has taught us wisdom.
True beer drinkers don't really care how
you get it there. J ust so you deliver the quality.
