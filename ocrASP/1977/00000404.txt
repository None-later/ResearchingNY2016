o the Editor:
Muny intramural athletic participants are
ohubly wondering why this is the fifth week
thc'semester and full sports are either barely
derwny or not underway at all. A few
ntrihuting factors were the Jewish holidays
. d the inclement weather we‘ve been
 during. However. a third and controllable
 ' tor is the fuel that the pluyingficlds are not
 any sort of condition to he plttycd on. The
ponsihility for this problem frills squarely

n the Grounds Department.

5 has been the prricticc in thc ptist. u
mortindum dated July 27. I977. containing
oiled information concerning where and
it full intramural sports were to be played.
scnt otit and approved. It specifically

requested that all playing fields be leveled. all
holes filled in with dirt. rind that all fields be
lined regularly. Even after repeated reminders
prior to the season. no action has been taken
as oftoday. Sept. 27. I977.

After the scheduled start of the season. Mr.
Dennis Elkin. Coordinator of Intramural
Athletics. met with the Chief Groundsman
who said that if we wanted the fields done we
would have to do t hem ourselves. In addition..
daily phone messages from Mr. Elkin
requesting information on whether or not the
fields were reitdy were ignored.

The AMIA Council uhhors the luck
of action and even common consideration
displayed by the Grounds Department. Our
distress is highlighted by the fact that the
intercollegiate fields are receiving it lot oftimc
and attention while our requests are quite
limited in contrast. We cannot allow pcoplcto
ptii'ticrputc on fields ridden with holes. rind we
tli'c 'not even able to grvethc studcnls advanced

'notice concerning cancellations due to the

Grounds Department‘s repented failure to
respond to our phone messages.
AMIA_ripologi/es for the delays tilltl we
hope to get everything underway shortly.

it should. ilild the lust thingthcy need is to be forced into another wait by
Central Council as it searches its budget for $l7.000.

liven if the money is pulled only temporarily from the emergency
spending line or the AABsurplus. it is imperative that it be appropriated
immediately so that construction can begin. If not. the airwaves at
SUNYA may well stay empty until next fall.

Budgeting the Budget Request
For the last few months. ii small quantity of copies of SUNYA‘s final
budget request have been floating around this campus. Yet it is almost
impossible for u SUNYA student to see one.

figures. but is one of the few ways in which a student can evaluate the
administration‘s goals. It outlines which programs are scheduled to be
cut. which departments will lose faculty in order to strengthen others.

Students have zero input in the SU NYA budget process. Yet it careful
unrilysis of the budch can give onc an idea of which departments
university hits ii serious or on-going committmcnt to. and which have
been thrown to the wolves.

When the ASP attempted to obtain a copy. SUNYA Budget Director
Hiil Brink produced a letter from the State Division of the Budget
cliissilying it us an internal document. not for release to the public.

The reason for DOB‘s move is all too obvious. It prevents people from
seeing and perhaps demanding at university proposed student health
clinic or u new language major or till entire new department until it is too
ltllC. until the swift and sure DOB ax has fallen.

’I'wo things are clear. First. students should play a larger role in this
university’s budget process. And when something like it university’s
budget request. which is an important indicator of campus chang‘ and
committmcnis is released, students have a right. and must demand the
right. to have access to this information.
