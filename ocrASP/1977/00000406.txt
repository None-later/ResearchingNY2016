Winning seems to be synonymous
with Albany State this fall, and the
Dane golfers are no exception. Doc
Sauer‘s ironmen made it 3-1 on the
season with a split of their dual
'match against Williams and RPI.

Prior to the Williams] RPI match.
Albany had ripped apart Hartwick
by an lit-stroke margin. 409-427.
Dick Derrick (78) and John
Ammermaii (79) led the individual
scoring on a “cold and rainy day, as
usual" according to (‘oiich Sauers.

' “I‘m very pleased.“ said coach
Suuers. “and you have to be anytime
you average under 80.” Siena ran
away with its own tourney. shooting
a 30! as compared to 3l5for Albany
State.

The second din of the Utica
Invitational at Honey Hills was a
washout. negating Ammerman‘s 80
and Bruce Heath‘s 82. two highly
competitive rounds in the wet and
rather unplayahle conditions tmtde
possible by Albany‘s late tee-off
time.

Danes also suffered the loss of
sophomore Marlt‘ Caruso tor the'
upcoming , SUNYAC
Championships as be injured "hit

back midway throughout the round. .

Frank Slade and Bill Wiener will
round out the Albany SUNYAC
entry at the Cooperstown course on
Monday morning.

‘ Slade. a freshman. owns a lower
stroke average than Caruso and will
benetil from theexpericnce. Wiener.

:a sophomore . hits it real line swing

and is a source of optimism for
Coach Sauers.

“He has one ofthe best swings on
the team. I‘m confident he can have
a good round at Cooperstown.“

And it‘s really unfortunate that it hiid to happen because the fan's here
won't get another chance to see the Danes for another month.

In fact. Itist year was the same. There were four home games and it rained '

Danes limped home with it 4-5 record. Their first losing record ever.

This year is it different story. For the few rain-drenched fans who witnessed
Saturday‘s massacre over Brockport. they saw that this year‘s team is worth
cheering for. '

'I'he Danes have won two straight games in convincing fashion after losing
to a superior St. Lawrence team; a team that wasn't even on Albany's
original schedule. Had it not been for Oswego dropping football from their
