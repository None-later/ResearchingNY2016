Danes Look For Third Straight

by Eddie Emerman

The Albany State varsity football
team goes for its third straight win
tomorrow. when it travels to
Rochester to play a team of hungry
Rl'l‘Tigers. Hungry. becauscthey‘re

looking for their first win of the
season altcr dropping their first two
games. in contrast. Albany is
comingol‘l’ two convincing wins after
losingtheirs isonopenertoa strong
St. lawrencc sqtitid.

In the past few years. the Danes
have been able to keep the Tigers
lanied. Last year. they won [7-7. In
fact. Albany has won the last four
outings and outscored Rl'l‘ lO9-l4
over that stretch.

When the teams take the turf
tomorrow. it Will be the first time in a
while that the Danes will be the
larger team.

“RIT has been so big in the past."
said Albany‘s head coach liob Ford.
“lint this year they're a little smaller
than we are."

And even in the three games
Albany has played this year. all the
opponents were of a larger sire. l‘he
Tiger‘s front line averages around
l90 pounds which is considerably
less than the 220-pound average the
Danes hiivc seen in previous games.

Coach Ford is looking for a good
solid game from his team against a
team he doesn't consider to be too
tough. “The main thing for its to do
is to continue to grow aiid improve."
said Ford. “We are capable of being
an excellent team. We‘re continuing
to work hard. especially to try and
eliminate mistakes we‘ve been
making.“

Ford was referring to the l7
fumbles his team basaeeuinulated in
the first three games and also some
"foolish penalties" the Danes have
been committing.

Ql'i'ensiveiy, Rl'i' is it youngteam
There are four Ireiihinen on the
starting team. with the quarterback

Jim Denk hciiig one of them.

Dcnk. a lCli-litittdcl‘. is what might
be labelled the “all-around
quarterback." according to Albany's
assistant coach .lack Siedlecki.
“Deuk doesn't really excel in one
area. He just does everything fairly
well." said Sicdlecki.

But the Danes‘ defense won‘t
really be tociising on Denk.
according to Sicdlccki. “The two
guys we have to watch are Kevin
Loveland and John Zahreski.“

Loveland. the spill end and also
the oliensivc captain. is the gity
Denk Will mostly throw to when he
throws the ball. "Lovcltind is a real
good receiver.“ said Siedlecki. “He‘s
got real good hands arid good speed.
We have to try and shot him off and
not let him get quick yardage on us.“

When the Tigers choose to rim
and not throw. they‘ll be doing it
from their ‘l-pro‘ formation with
Zahrcski doing the bulk ofthe work.

and it gives Carlos a lot more
freedom to maneuver.“

Mittty Denora added the first of
his two goals lateinthetirst half on a

crossing pass from (iage. Denora
knocked it into the lower righthttnd

corner to give Albany it 2-0 halftime
lead. “A quality goal." said
Schicl‘l’elin.

Artingo opened the scoring in the
half. when he skillfully
dribhlcd through three men in the
penalty area iitid pushed the ball pitst
the RH goal-keeper.

Ten minutes later. Denora netted
his second goal of the game before
Araiigo tallied Albany‘s tinal two
NCOI’US.

Schiellelin praised the team play
of the Danes. particularly that of

Frank Selca. who passed tip several

shots for better scoring
opportunities. .

“This type of play is something we
haven‘t had in it while." said
Schiefl'elin. "lt‘sjttst the opposite of
what occurred in the Keene St. game
(Albany's only loss). The team is
very much together notv. working
hard iii practice and hustling (in
gaiiiesi.“

Second Shutout

It was the second consecutive
shutout turned iii by Albany goalie
Alberto (iiordano. who shared
duties with Dario Aratigo.

Delenscmeii Aldo Sergovicli and
Ricardo Rose also continued their
strong play. “Aldo took control of
the dclcltS‘ and settled them down

when needed.” said Schieffelin.

The game. played on it rain-
soaked l'ield. marked the third win
against one loss for Albany. The
Danes iirc hopingto improve ontliat

they travel to .Cortland for an
important conference game that

the Danes are seeking to aveitgc

Chem Calls PhD Loss Unfair

by Matthew Cox

The Chemistry Department
released a statement yesterday
cxpressi ng “anger. frustration and a
sense of having been treated
unfairly" at SUNYA's decisionto
terminate the chemistry PhD
program before an evaluation ofthe
program by the State Educated
Department was allowedtorunits
full course.

“We feel that the University
decision to suspend the doctoral
program in chemistry is based on
factors external totlie qtiality ofthe
nrogram.“ the statement said.
 . . we feel the decision ofthe
Universityto siispcndthe program
was premature."

Acting SUNYA President Vincent
0' Leary announced last Tuesday
that the chemistry doctoral program
would be terminated. followinga
“ not favorable" review from an SED
Rating Committee. The Rating
Committee constituted the third
stagcina t'ivcstachEl) evaluation
process.

The decision to terminate the
program part way through the
process “unfortunately placed a
higher priority on expedieneythan
on the balanced priorities which
produced. for example. the Mission
Statement." the departments
statement said. “This has aroused
among us anger. frustration aiida
sense of having been treated
unfairly."

0'l.‘arysaid last night that he had

not seen the department‘s final
statement.

He said that the decision to
terminate was made by him. on the
recommendation ofa committee
formed by the Graduate Academic
Council. after both had been
exposed toa report from an SEl)
RatingCommittcc drawn up by a
group of nationally known chemists.

“The university was presented
with that report.“ O‘l .eary said. “We
had to make a decision oii whether to
go fort and with the proccss. it was
our decision that it was itot
warranted." he said.

The S F. i) first reviewed the
chemistry program three y 'ars ago
as a part of a state-wide evaluation
aimed at rcdueingthenumbcrof
doctoral programsin New York.
The program at that time was
granted "provisional continuance"
for a period oft hree years bytlie

areas where improvement inthe
