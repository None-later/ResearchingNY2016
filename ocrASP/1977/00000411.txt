BURNT OUT
ll your psychologist seems to be
losing interest in you and is
completely bored by your deepest
Freudian confessions. don‘t worry.
The prohlern is probably with your

shrink. and not you. The
American Psychological
Association convention iii San

Francisco has been told thiit it‘s not
uncommon l'or an analyst to sul'l'cr
from what is called the psychological
"burnout" syndrome. What
happens. according to the report. is
that psychologists cart get an
oycrdosc ol other people‘s problems
and "burnout" mentally. l'lie' net
cllcct is said to produce an extreme
state at exhaustion in the analysts.
lcay iiig tlicrii with a total
rrrdillcrcncc towards anything not
directly concerned wrtli themselves.
It you're the paticttt. it‘s probably
best to had someone else it ho's still
tubing and able to listen.

CRYING SHAME

Doctor Sidney Gottlich. a former
chemical researcher for the CIA.
told a Senate subcommittee tltis
week that l‘or'cign government agents
somehow managed to drug members
ol President Nrson‘s travelling party
during a Nixon visit abroad six years
ago. According to (iottlicb. the
drug caused the American til'l'icials

JOB CRAZY -
If you sometimes think your‘
job is literally driving you
crazy. you‘re not alone: “a

occupations that are most likely to
turn workers into mental

itieritally-unscttlitig job ol' all is that
ol being a "health worker". l'ollowcd
closely by the occupation ol' waiter
or waitress. according to the
study. The National Irtstitutc for
Occupational Sal'cty and Health in
Cincinnati says it based its lindings
on the percentage ol \vorkcrs iii
