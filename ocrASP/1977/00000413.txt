Travesity Troupe
Superny Bizarre

By FRANCESCA COHN
The company regretfully announced over
the public address“the prima ballerina has
unfortunately stabbed her toe but has
graciously consented to hop on one foot and
save the performance." The hilarious
performance by Les Ballets Trockaderode
Monte Carlo was an uprourious success this
past weekend at the PAC. '
The all male t roupc. dressed in tiitits. wigs
and toeshocs. committed everyfaux pas
imaginahlcinthe realm ofclassical ballet. One
look at the program and you know they‘re up
:t_o mischief. The dancers have names like
Madame Olga ’I‘sikahoti mskaya. Dame
'Margaret l.owin-Oeteyn. Vera
. Na met but unova. and Ida Nevcrsaynevti. The
_|'rockaderos‘ set ottt to mock just about all of
'l9th century R tissiau ballet. contemporary
choreographers. repertory and conventions of
nce.
.i I’hcii' opening-nightprogram began with
'lhc ballet classic“Swan Lake". In this version

c lrocks point otit the absurdityofa plot

love with a bird.
All the dances are not parodies ofspecific

ballets. some are aimed at specific
choreographers. The program claims that

is no eoincideneethal several of Martha's
crumbs are sprinkled throughout the dance.

The companyinsiststhntthey neversolely

to purposely cast the wrong person fort he
part. If you can't get somebody who's perfectly
right. it‘s more satisfying to get someone who‘s
perfectly wrong.

entangled in the endless winding and
unwinding of the chain.

Today the male‘s role in ballet has grown tothe

pretentious about passing for real ballerinas.
There are no efforts to hide llat. hairy chests. or

Natch 'l'aylcr. one ofthe directors. claims
that "female impersonation in ballet isnoi
impersonation ol'l'emalcs biit of symbols. We
belicw dancing helongsto everybody. there is
no gender in dancing. Women don't wear
tutttsto work. it‘s a uniform. A ballerina isn't a
