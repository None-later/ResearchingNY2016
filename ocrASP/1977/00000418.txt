OCA President John Kennedy

Although seventy-eight per cent oi
the i977-7ti TAP applications have
been awarded 'as of Monday. 86.000
students do not know thegstatus of
theirs awards. according to the
Higher Education Services
Corporation.

H ESC President » Eileen
Dickinson said that 303,800 awards
have been made out olithe 390.500
applications received this year.

“We have turned our operation
from an ofﬁce job to a production
job. We‘re not drowning in paper as

. we were last year. . . 'I'he pay-off has

come. . 

in a recent report. the New York
State Senate Task Force on Critical
Problems challenged HESC‘s
lavorahle progress reports as
"questionable optimism.“ HESC‘S
claim that nearly three times the
amount of awards have been issued
so tar this year as compared to last
year must be qualified by two
considerations. according to the

Senate reportflly special agreement
with the ‘ Corporation ,CUNY
preprocessed over l00.000
applications. Therefore j.statistice
released by HESC which include the
CUNY applications. do‘ not
accurately reilect its actual in-house
production rate. ,

Also. the report stated that
HESC‘s goal of completing 80 per
cent ol‘the awards by September has
lorced thousands of students to
register in public and private colleges
that open at the end oi" August for
classes and to commit themselves to
tuition payments before they
received their awards.

SUNY Coordinator of Financial
Aids Martin Leikovits said.
"HESC's processing system has been
patclted up... but it hasn‘t been
i'elormed. The antiquated clerical
procedure used by the State
Education Department was more
responsive to individual needs than
ilL‘SC has been. although the
processing rttie was slower."

snsu legislative Director David ‘

siiuaiion has improved. but it is still .

not acceptable. Students are
spending their own money making
long distance calls t 0 their legislators
and to HESCtolind outthestatus of
their applications.

' According to Dickinson. the
backlog of almost l0,000 awards
pending l‘orm the l976—77 academic
year has been set. aside in order to
speed up this , year‘s
processing. Coyne noted that a
"total skepticism“ pervades the
student community. “There is a lack
ol trust in the efﬁciency of HESC.
We‘re working on a legislative
proposal to require the Corporation
to respond within a certain period of
lime." Coyne added that the
proposal would not cost the State
more money. but would put tighter
controls on processing cl'iiciency.

li ESC Vice President for
Research and Policy Analysis
Michael (.‘ruskic said that HESC
will attempt to move up distribution
of applications to April. so I978-79
processing can begin next May. This
would give HESC a month‘s lead
time toward completion of the
majority ol‘ the applications by the
citd of next summer.
