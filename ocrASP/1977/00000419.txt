A leading medical journal is out .
with the surprising ﬁnding that
persons born during the month of
March are more apt to suffer from
schizophrenia than people born at
other times of the year.

Association's publication. the
Archives of General Psychiatry. says .

that the unexplained link between on customers, .

what is described as a manna-

throughout old Hebrew literature. v

They say that the device seems to
have been a special laser-powered

water and waste products into edible ~

Dale and Sassoon go on to say
that theirtheory raisesthe intriguing

possibility that the device was given .

to the Israelites by visitors from

The Old Testament. the sacred
manna-making device. whatever it
was. was housed in a special temple
that was sacked and destroyed about
600 B.C.

SECOND THOUGHTS ‘

If Patty Hearst were to go on trial

for the same charges today. facing
the same jury that convicted her a
little more than one year ago. would
she again be found guilty‘.’

Apparently. the answer to that
question is no. at least according to
her one-time jailer and now an
author of an upcoming book about
Hearst.

Jiminel is the woman who guarded

jury reunion held  year after the
verdict was handed down. all l2 of
the ‘jurors indicated they had
changed their minds and that they
would now vote for Hearst's
acquittal rather than her guilt. ‘

One juror. Bruce Blaustein.
reportedly blamed the negative
verdict. which resulted in a
maximum seven-year sentence for
Hearst. in part. on thejudge. whohe
snid wanted “to put her on trial for
everything.“

PLANT HAPPY

that private companies which
maintain living plants in their ofﬁces
are enjoying side ell'ects.

According to The Journal. ﬁrms

and make good conversation items

However. turning 'corporate
ofﬁces into miniature gteenhouses
has its drawbacks as well: ce

are transferred to a new ofﬁce. away
from their favorite shrub.
