I!" MARIAN FI'NG
Thousands of people of all ages came
from all parts of New York and the
Northeast last Sgtturday to witness the
spectacular sport of ballooning: tltc
fourth annual Hot Air Balloon Festival.
"the early morning rain. the hem)-
densc fog and the chilly autumn w ‘ather
did not stop the enthusiastic balloonists
from inflating their balloons. the first
balloon inflated "the Spirit of (ilcns

How Does It Stay Up?

spreads out. and the weight per cubic foot
becomes less than the weight of the cooler air
outside the balloon. Since it is ligltter than the
test of tltc air. it rises.takingthc balloon along
with it.

In it hot air balloon. the air inside the.
entelope is heated to temperatures I00“ to
250" greater than the outside air. At those
temperatures. the expanded air inside the
envelope becomes so mueh lighter than the
air outside that the balloon and its
attachments begin to rise.

When the air is allowed to cool or cscttpe.
the balloon descends. by adjusting the
temperature ot the trapped air. the pilot
adjusts the Weight ofthc air. and he can rise or
descent as he likes.

thn the balloon arrives. with the entire
envelope and all its equipment sque-zed into
the gondola. you'll be surprised ttl
its small si/c. But once it's laid out
downwind lor intlatioit. you‘ll see how large
the balloon reallyis. l‘l‘tltll mouth tocrowtt. it
may be (it) lcet loiig iind nearly as wide.

the ballonist will assemble his basket.
checking instruments and making sure cables
iind fuel lines are secure. then. with his crew.
holding the titotttlt open. an electric or
gasoline-powered ftttt will force air into the
envelope. Within minutes it will be the size of
II small house.

Alter checking inside and out tor kinks iii
the cables and tears in the envelope. the pilot
will ignite the propane burttcr. and ttiin the
Home directly inside the balloon.

As the air begins to heat. the bitlloon will
begin to rise. and the pilot will step into the
brisket as be tilts it ttpriglit. Finally. he will
shut off the burner. lnlhited but still “heavy.”
the balloon is ready to go.

When the pilot opens his burner valve »
using mediqu blasts of ﬂame and with it
careful eye on the rate-of-elimh i iidicatorw-the

 

  
    

balloon will slowly rise to th 'altitutlc the pilot
has selected.

W here will he go‘.’ Wherever tltc wind takes
him. at a speed very nearly that of the wind.
tlut he does have some control over the flight.
With the help of the Night Service Station. a
lacility which provides weather iind other
iiilormation to airmen. he cart learn the
direction and speed of ttic winds aloft in
increments of 3000 feet above the ground. He
may be told ol surface winds from 190" A‘l'
llllllzlt Knots wmos A'l‘ Ftili‘l' Mtott'r ltli
iii.thNo liltUM ° at six knots. and twisting all
the way to 300° at 30 knots if tihc ascends to
I2.(l0t) feet. By selecting altitude with winds
going the direction he wants to go. and by
carefully watching his compass and charts.
pilots ciin lrcquently lly to a destination very
nearly where they want to be. '

Sooner or later it has to end. The pilot
begins to look fora place to land.

A valley would be nice wwith a downwind
screen of trees. But any clear area of 50 yards
or more without stumps or obstructions which
can‘t damage the envelope will do. If possible.
the area should be level; ifnot.the pilot will try
to land on the downhill side.

l‘nel valves control the final rule ofdesccnt.
and once the decision is made. the
ntancuvering vent will be opened to "dump"
some of the air and descend more rtipidly.
l'tnully.just before touchdown. fuel valves are
closed. and the pilot light blown out.

Once on the ground. the “rip eord“ opens
the dcllution port in the crown of the balloon.
As the envelope ftlllS to the ground. the
gondola will gently tip overusthe wind carries
the htilloon beyond it.

Hopefully. by this time the ground crew will
have arrived to help prick and load the
bttlloott. And. as iintielimax. the long drive
home begins. J
