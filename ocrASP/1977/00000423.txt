Berkley] Putnam has been big news
lately. what with Children of Dune by
Frank Herbert makingthe best-seller lists
. forthem. and with their expanded science
l ﬁction line. improved graphics. and other
less noticeable but equally important
things.

The science fiction editor at
Berkley/Putnam is David G. Hartwell. I
met 'Dave for the second time at the
World Science Fiction Convention in
Miami Beach this past September, and
was pleased with his attitude about
science fiction. He is a man who had been
involved with science fiction for many
years. at several different levels. and his
expertise and concern for the field can fill
one‘s heart with joy. He also put some
review copies in my hands and here they
are:
The Hour of The Dragon ($|.95) by

Robert E. Howard is part of two waves
(one by Berkley. the other by Ace Boo s
of the gran Conan revival. Conan 
timmerian was a sword-wielding
strongman who lived during the mythical
Hyvorian Age. before the Ice Ages.
Before he died. Robert E. Howard wrote
a series of stories and one book about
Conan. tnost of which appeared in the
’ late. great fantasy magazine Weird Tales.
i; Since his death. about half a dozen
writers have taken Howard‘s notes and
.1 written stories hinted at there. havetaken
', a fraction of a paragraph or even a
} proposed title ofa work. padded it out to
novella or novel length. and published the
resultant work as a “collaboration.” Now
tltis material outweighs in wordagc the
original. gcnuinc lloward tnatcrial. Then
there have been comic books and
magayincs about the ancient warrior
which have further clouded the \icw of
Howard's creation.

The Hour of The Dragon is thc rcal
thing. the text in the book reproduced
from the text of the serial that ran in
lf'i'irrl Tales in 1935 and I930. Without
keeping in mind that this work is dated by
40 years of literary progress in l he fantasy
field. I can complain that (‘onan is not a
sympathetic character. that his habit of
grttnting ‘ach polysyllablc hc painfully
constructs is annoying. and that I do not
‘ helicvc that anyone. no mattcr how
strong. can cttt through arms. legs and
torsos as easily as he.

But the writing does have a certain raw
' power. it certainly outshines the

imitations written decades after it. and

the plot-line is not bad. if more than a

little predictable. In addition to this. it
can serve as a historical document for
Howard fans. Hour of 7710 Dragon also
has an excellent cover and a fold-out
poster (which should be credited to the

k' __ artist. should they not. 8] Pl).

Keith Laumcr has been writing science
fiction books which have received little
notoriety for about l5 or 20 years now. I
guess. His latest is Worlds of The
[Ill/)t'l'llllll ($l.5tl). It is short. straight-
forward adventure.

The Maxoni Drive is a device that
allows travellers to venture from one
Earth to another Earth in an alternate
continuum. where historical events have
varied from those we are familiar with.
Most of these worlds are uninhabitablc.
because most have discovered the
Maxoni Drive and have not learned how
to properly control it. In fact. all but three
Earths have tnct this fate when the story
opens. Onc continuum possesses the
[hire one is our own Earth..and the third
is an liarth that has had a nuclear war.
and also possessesthc Maxoni Drive. . .
but thcy shouldn‘t. The question is. how
did they get it. and how can they be
stopped"? the question becomes \‘ital
when they attack the other continuunts.

lhc mainstream of science fiction has
nc\cr been far rcmmcd from the mystery
category. and this is an example. 'l he plot
points directly toward tltc satisfactory
explanation of the panic. and Laumcr's
adcquatc ptosc takes its through to the
cod, \‘fhcn we get there we are rather
tinaffcctcd. lot while the prose.
charactct'i/ation and resolution are all
adequate. \\t.‘ are awarc of the fact that
they are only adequate. and that tltcrc is
morc titan cnough "only adequate"
scicncc fiction on the book racks today.

lhc Di l‘atc coyct' is. however. much

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

 

more than adequate.

Ascension is C harlcs l.. Grant's second
book. and it is goingf'orSl.25. It forms an
interesting contrast to the Laumcr book.
for while its plot is as direct and straight-
forward. it has those certain touches
which make it more worthwhile. Orion

’arric. in a post-holocaust Earth. is on a

mission of vengeance. His father died in
thc megalopofis of l’hifayork. and l’arric
wants to find the killers.

’arric is also an overly-suspicious. not
altogether nice person who has his own
doubts and fears and gets sick to his
stomach when he is forced to kill
someone. These attributes help to make
l’arric's character a little more three-
dimcnsional. l’arrie has as his
,companions a quiet adroid and a woman
who resents being called “girl.” I don‘t
blame her. It's been done for the past 50
years in science fiction. and it‘s good to
see her. and (irant. takingsotnccxccption
to such conventions. This is worth your
time.

Keith Roberts is an English writer.
Someday someone should do a
qualitatiyc analysis of exactly how
English fiction differs from American
fiction. The difference is definitely there.
perhaps manifestch iii a certain subtlety
of tone. it tcndcncy to let events explain
thcmscfycs and characters speak for
thcmschcs. [he cover of The Passing of
'Iln' Dragons. a collection of Robert‘s
short fiction. declares him to be “a major
\oicc lll scicncc fiction." '1 his is pcrhaps
wishful thinkng because Roberts has not
i'ccciycd much notice. at lcast on this side
of the Atlantic. dcspitcfhc fact that one of
his earlier books. lllt‘ Inner Wheel. was
published by l’luyhoy Press which does
not concern itself with any but the most

accomplished writers. as a rule. '- v
The stories in this book date f rom I965
to I977. and we are not given their places
of original publication. This is a shame.
beottuse if one off he stories presented was
indeed published in I977. I would like to

‘: khow so Lean perhaps nominate it forth!

Hugo Nebula. It is good policy in any
case.

The stories herein are rather long. and
for the most part slow-moving. For this
reason I wouldn‘t recommend reading all
of Dragons at a single sitting. nor would I
attempt to review all of the stories.
Conveniently. there are two distinct styles
Roberts uses in these stories. so I can
review one of each with a clear
conscience.

“Boulter‘s Canaries“ is set in the
English countryside. for the most part.
and concerns Boultcr. an engineer. and
Glyn. the narrator. The plot concerns
Boulter‘s search for empcrical evidence of
ghosts hattnting an old English ruin. He
finds it. and the ghosts find him and are
rather pccy'cd with his intrusion. How he
dispatches them is almost anticlimactic.
but satisfactory nonetheless. The writing
is precise and powerful. Robert‘s

juxtaposition of thc supernatural and thc

cwryday masterful.
