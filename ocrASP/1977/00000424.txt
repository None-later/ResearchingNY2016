“me is a tendency ill this school for

on the quads. It is. at times. quite difficult to
eat the "meals" given to its by U.A.S.

The stall at lndian moves people through at
a record rule and produces lood that is hot and
reasonable tasty intieli iriorc often than on the
other uptown quads. It is the basic consensus
at Indian that one of the best features
is the competent. oftcn friendly crew that
does their best to get edible meals to us
sometimes annoying students.

It is not Ill the normal course of student
activity here to admit liking some of the
load llL‘l'L‘. but the silent majority ill Indian
does appreciate the hard work ol the often-
inaligncd norkers here.

A Dangerous Game

3' Neil ll. Butlerklee
Recently ROADS (Evangelical Groups
gninst Dangerous Sports) came out with a

‘tiitcnient churning that bowling was it
. angerous sport. An EGAI)S spokesperson

tad this to say: “It is our beliefthat bowling is
oth physically and mentally harmful to the
articipant as well as the spectator."

At first i was agiiinstlheir claims. Frankly,|
hought that they were nuts. liut as l studied

f he situation. especially in the light of my 0W"

ersonitl experiences. I had to agree with

‘ hem. howling is a dangerous sport.
' lo start with there is. oi coursc.thc famous -

bnwlcr's still neck." This comes lroin
xcessive peering over the scorckeeper‘s
boulder to see your score. There just aren‘t

- Dough choirs at the scoring table to go

round. ln mOSt cases it is easy to reeognire
lie scorekccpcr: he iii the one who always
ll“. (When there are seven pins left up. he
' ﬂrks down it seven for himself. instead of it
time.) | used to keep score a lot; i also used to
tn it lot.

Some ofthe more serious injuries associated
ilh bowling have appeared on my medical
ccord: ti broken index linger lrom getting it
tuck in the hull ttnd not realizing it until the
all. and I. were halfway down the lane; it
wisled back from slidingdown the lane: and ii
uneussinn from colliding with the pins. This

was just during the warm-ups. l. have also
sutlered through many traumas brought on
explicrtly by bowling. which I trundle by
kicking the ball return.

According to l£(iAl)S. “It is not only the
bowler who gets hurt but those watchingthc
game.“ it seems that many people are injured
trom being struck With a bowling ball that was
released in the wrong direction. accidentally.
ol course. lhc EtiAIJS official commented
that “most people do not enjoy. rind even find
it disconilorling. being hit with an errant ball.“
He then mumbled something about it few
people who like getting hit with the ball and
other odd thiirgs. but [won‘t get into that now.
(l‘or lurtlicr intormution about the Tuesday
night SM. bowling league citll: (Mimi-999‘)
between 3 and 4 run.)

liack to howling l€(iAl)S. who are also
opposed to hockey. loolball and group sex.
recommended .to Congress that bowling be
harmed due to its destructive nature. I believe
that this is a step in the right direction.

Whatever the outcome of EUADS lobbying
etloris. l have decided to give up bowling in
liivor of a much suler sport-»skydiving. I
eventually plan to become ll skydiving pro at it
local skydivrng/iennis club. We got to’cttrn ll
living somehow to pay off all those bills for
kicked in brill returns.

 

. policy;'thc proposal submitted to- Council Wednesday night is a good

    

 

The Root of AllEvll r - , f j   _
Stipend: — monetary renumcntion for those individuals who V
volunteer their time and energy in the op'cratidnc of SA groups — have
long been a thorn in the side of both SA and its groups. Central Council '
is to be commended for undertaking a complete rcWritc of SA stipend

start. '

it does. however. contain several questionable items. No student
receiving a stipend will be permitted to work more than tcnhours per
week. This requirement unfairly discriminates against the student
receiving a small stipend. Why prevent him from earning money at an
outside job if he is handling his group duties competenth

This is also a step beyond the bounds of a good stipend policy. The
policy should not concern itself with the ﬁnancial needs of the
individual. Nor should it attempt to police SA groups. and try to insure
that an ofﬁcer is doing his job.

There must be some measure of trust in dealing with stipends. This
was a major factor in the failure of past attempts at stipend policies; SA
simply did not treat its own group members as responsible adults.

The proposal also suggests that the individual seek academic credit
before requesting a stipend. While this may be an attractive way to save
some money. it may ultimately cause more problems than it solves.
Although no student would be forced to accept credit instead of cash.
the proposal places undue emphasis on running student group work
through community service or an independent study.

Again. this is outside the limits of a stipend policy. A student‘s
academic concerns are his own. And ifthe general manager ofthc radio
station has a three credit independent study in RCO, that should not
preclude the possiblity of the committee granting him a stipend.

There is one central question that should be resolved before any kind
of policy is finalized: are stipends necessary? SA President Dave Gold
has been known to speak out against them on more than one occasion —
even though he has not seen lit to relenquish his own $l608.50— and to
go through weeks of work only to face a veto would be a mistake.

 

QUOTE or THE DAY
“I think i'I'.r an excel/ml policy that will be acceptable 10 all. ”

policy
