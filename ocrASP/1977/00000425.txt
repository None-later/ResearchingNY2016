The Neutron Bomb

by Allan Rauch'

A few days ago. the House of
Representatives approved funding of the
controversial neutron bomb. The President is
in favor of developcment of this new weapon.
which could have a profound affect on this
country‘s defense plans for the next few
decades. Just what is the neutron bomb. and
why has there been so much controversy
surrounding its deployment?

The proposed neutron bomb is really not a
bomb at all. it is a nuclear warhead; a “clean”
nuclear warhead. A regular nuclear warhead
does must of its damage through heat blast
and burning. This results in the destruction of
everything in the immediate area of the blast:
buildings. factories. farms. and of course.
people. The neutron warhead is detonated at a
height of about 300 feet. Thcareii immediately
under the blast sight. about I40 yards in
radius. is totally destroyed. in exactlytlic same
manner as it regular nuclear warhead.
However. as we move away from the center of
the blast. the amount of heat and burning are
reduced to a minitnum. There is however very
high radiation cmmittcd in an area of about
one mile in diameter.

This extremely high level or radiation kills
all living things in that area. All buildings.
however. remain intact. People on the very
fringe of the one mile area may contract
radiation kills all living things in that area. All
buildings. however. remain intact. People on
the very fringe of the one mile area may

contract radiation sickness and die

agoniringly long deaths. The radiation
dissiipates quickly in the affected area. and

friendly troops would be able to occupy the
target area only days after the attack and
suffer no radiation sickness.

The main advantage of this type of weapon
is obvious. To illustrate this advantage. let‘s
set up a hypothetical situation: The Russians.
using strictly convential forces, have invaded
West Germany. and completely overpowered
NATO convential forces in the area. Th
Russians now stand on the border of France.
NATO ﬁeld commanders report to the
President that they could never regain the
territory lost with convential weapons.
because the Russiiin advantage in both
hardware and manpower is just too great.
Only nuclear weapons. the generals tell the
President. can force the Russians out.

If the President chose to use nuclear
warheads. not only would he risk a nuclear
holocaust. but even if the Russians don‘t
respond with nuclear warheads. and we regain
West Germany. our nuclear weapons will have
made a no mans land of our own territory. All
West German factories and manufacturing
centers would be utterly destroyed. the land
would be radiated. and all the livestock would
be dead.

If. however. the President had at his
disposal the neutron bomb. he could ordcrthc
bomb used against only military targets. The
high accuracy of the neutron warhead would
insure the dciiths ofthe invaders. while leaving
the production centers of West (iciiiiiiiiy
unscathed. I he West (ierman ptiptlliicc \\iIIlltl

horrifying. while the prospect of surrender is
manifest. We need and deserve another option
besides nuclear war or surrender. '
As far as the opponents charge that the
bomb is inhumane. I claim exactly the

I think that the United States needs the
neutron bomb to give us that crucial third
option. I hope that the new weapon is
developed and deployed as quickly as
possible.

Caring: A Lost Ideology
tor Today

bv Peter Levy

.loc woke up one Monday morning. It “as
nine o’clock. and everthing around him
lookcd stationary. He proceeded to breakfast
for the same basic meal. After breakfast. Joe
strolled up and down the academic podium
visiting classes. a friend. and the campus
center. He was thinking about a future test.
and an upcoming puny. At dusk..loe Went to
dinner. He then spoke to some friends. and
then studied. and then went to sleep.
studied. iind then went to sleep.

On the very same dav. 35 people staggered
in to an Albany care center. the IS IIIL‘
alcoholics. They are mostly men on welfare
who live in the streets. 'l‘liese men arrive atlhc
center intoxicated. leave sober. and usually
return within a iew days intoxicated again. At
another center. a senior citi/cn agency. 20
elderly Albany residents cillici' called or
walked in lor help. then problems ranged

Is the university a place to learn. or a place‘
to he taught? For some people the two
concepts go together. for others they don't.
l‘or many. diiriiigthe oil’sthcydidn‘t. (irantcd
students were studying chemistry. business.
and law. Yet. many were also actively involved
in social retorm. College campuses were a
playing ground for student activism. Students
had an understanding of the social problems
lacing them and their surrounding
ciiiiroiiiiient. in conclusion. there was an
ideology. An ideology tor a better world.

It seems so quiet here. I have not heard one
person bring tip a conversation about the
health and ivclliirc problems that exist today.
It should run surprise me because I would not
think to bring up the topic either; But why is
lllh so? Do we need another war to bring it
out. or III'\' we Just a relatively conseniitiyc

concerned with scll' iinprotctneiil‘.’ I don't
know. l'l'tlm what lohscrve. students seenito

bioudci Ideology.

This ‘A‘ and that ‘II‘ will hopefully yield
happiness. security. and a job. In contrast.
this drtink and that ghetto will yield chaos in
the social system. A system we will ultimately
have to be part oi.
