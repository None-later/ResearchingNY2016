In his 36-piigc opinion. Associate

Craig Collins. the 34-year-old

Allen charge. argues that "the

jurisprudence. It‘s really it pro-

"When I was iii the district

‘ less than ‘ three - hours the r jury

returned with a unanimous guilty
verdict.

According to State Justice Mosk.
“the indisputable modern trend is to
abandon Allen“ in US. courts.
Mosk said the instruction has been
disapprchd in at least twenty-two
states. Of these 22 states. l9 have
ruled against it within the last seven
years. Although three U.S. Circuit
Courts of Appeal ltave also
disapproved it. Mosk noted that the
US. Supreme Court has not issued
an opinion at its legality since the
original Allen v. United States
reached the Court iii I896.

ln I972. the American liar

the Allen charge with art instruction
