SILENT PICTURES

An analysis of 551 commercials"

considered the best in the industry
has found that most women
portrayed in TV ads have little or
nothing to say.

The analysis. by the Women‘s
Committee of the Screen Actors‘
Guild. discovered that women in
television ads were outnumbered
two to one by men. When they were
finally cttsi for parts in a commercial.
the committee says. women were
apparently offered little or nothing
to say in them.

lltc '(iuild committee says that
women ' in the SSI commercials
surveyed. which Were entered in the
I976 clio competitions for the best
commercials. were between the ages
oi 20 and 29 and generally had non-
spcaking roles.

the survey also found that
minorities comprised only [4 percent
til all commercial pcrforincrs.and of
that number. minority men
outnumbered minority women two
to one.

MORE TRICKS

l‘ormer Secretary oi State Henry
Kissinger has been accused iii a
icderal court at unlawlully removing
trout government liles cigltt years of
telephone conversation transcripts.

Kissinger was charged in a civil
still. lilcd last i‘cbruary. with taking
the documents illegally. and then
doitatiitg them to the Library of
Congress in rct urn lor an agreement.
the agreement stipulated that the
papers would be locked away for 25
years and only be available to
Kissinger himsell.

lltc suit was lilcd by the Reporters
( omtnitec lor l‘rccdom of t he I’rcss'.
several historians. and the public
interest group. the Military Audit
l’ioJcct.

llie l’laintilis argue that the

transcripts are public records tinder

 
 

the Federal Records Act and that it' -

was "unlawful" for Kissinger to
remove them from state department
liles. '

David Ginsburg. Kissinger‘s
attorney. however. contended in ii
preliminary heiiring in the case last
week. that State Department legal
oli'icials had approved the donation:
he claims the documents were merely
“working papers“ containing
confidential information which
should not be made available to the
public.

MISSING FUEL

A former supervisor at the Kerr-

company misled the federal
government when Kerr McUcc
claimed it cotild account for
plutonium fuel that liiid

inaga/inc. lornier department
supervisor .lini Smith claims that on
at least two occasions in I974.
involving a total til 40 potinds of
missing plutonium. the company
Ialscly told lcderal investigators that
the lost nuclear fact had been found
in a clogged drainpipc at the plant.

Smith claims. however. that the
missing plutonium was never found.
He says i ltat. in one case. iiivolviitgllt

22 pounds could still be in there.”

Smith says that despitethis failure
to locate evidence of the missing fuel.
the federal, government accepted
Kerr-McGee‘s word thatthe lost fuel
liiid been iiccounted for. The missing
plutonium is reportedly enough to
produce four to live home-made
nuclear devices. V

Karen Silkwood. a 28-year-old
worker ill the Kerr-McGee plant.
died in a mysterious car crash nearly
tlirec years ago at it time when she-
was charging the company with
numerous safety and security
violations at the plant. Silkwoud had
also suggested just before her death
that a plutonium-smuggling ring
might had been diverting fuel out of
the nuclear facility.

WHAT'S GOING ON

Rolling Stone miigtiline rcpons
that several key witnesses in the
Karen Silkwood case say they htive
been subjected to strange burglaries
and threatening telephone calls in
icccnt months.

Silkwood was the 28-year-old
vvoi'kcr at the KchMcUce
plutonium plant who died three
years ago in a mysterious car crash

TELLING ALL

The House Select Committee on
Assassinations has been given the
power to grant immunity to ‘
witnesses who refuse to testify.

The new power was granted this
week by the full House by a vote of
290m in. ’

Assassination Conttiiittec
Chairperson Louis Strikes argued
that the immunity power was needed
because there are a number ol
witnesses in the .ll-K assassination
case who. tnStokcs‘ words. “may be
members at orgatii/etl crime or
soldiers at ioi'tiinc."

Stokcs’ claimed that the
tommittcc has already located as

whom itnintiiiity might be granted in
