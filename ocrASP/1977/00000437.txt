NEW YORK (AP) A baseball
rivalry dormant for I4 years will be
resumed Tuesday night when the
Los Angeles Dodgers meet the New

ol the I977 World Series.
llie Dodgers will start
Sutton. the curve-balling
hander who was l4—ll during the
season. He’ll oppose fragile left-
hiiridcr Don (.iullet. who was l4-4
during the year but was hurt in the
opening game of the playoffs. His
shoulder remains questionable.

For Sutton. the game will mark
the lull'illment iii a dream.

"I have been dreaming about
pitching in Yankee Stadittrn all my

ol mental shutouts against the
Yankees here."

When they played in llrooklyn.

Some of the happiest Albany
State varsity athletes this weekend
could be seen crossing the finish line
on theirhome cross country course.
The Great Danesi‘in their final dual
meet this fall. upended the Colgate
Red Raiders on Saturday. 23-37.

“We consider it one of our big
meets.” said Colgate head coach Jan
Hunsinger. “We wanted it badly.“

Bat Albany's barriers were just as
psyched. and they showed it on the
course. “They run well. sure deserved
to win it." said Hunsinger.

For the second straight meet.
senior co—captain Brian Davis was
the Danes‘ top runner. He ran his
best time ever on Albany‘s 5.05 milc
course, clocking in at 25:54. this
slashed his previous fastest time by
lour seconds. that going back to his

freshman yeiir.

"Every meet i feel I'm improvinga
little." said Davis. “All I can see is
uphill.“

Diivis‘ strategy for the race was
not to match his speed with Colgtttc‘s
Bill Fisher.‘who won the individtial
scrap in 25:44.5. “Fisher is an
excellent runner.“ said Davis. “It
was stupid of me to go out with
him."

Albany head coach Robert
Munsey only had praise for Davis.
especially in his captain‘s role. “He's
just been a helluva ciipttiiii in every
way." remarked Miinsy. “Ile‘s acting
the way a senior captain should act."

llie veteran coach also felt that
when Davis came on strong tit the
end ol the meet. so did the rest ol the
Danes. “He picked it up. and
everyone picked it tip it itli him." said

Cleveland Worries Clyde

NEW YORK (AP) “I'll be very
nervous when I get to Cleveland.“
said Walt Frazier.

“It‘s a new situation. a new team. a
new city. I‘m ‘Cool Clyde.‘ but I'm
not that cool." said Frazier. who has
amassed more points and assists and
played in more games foi the New
York Knicks than any other player.
He spoke in measured but cniotion-
lilled words Monday about the
weekend deal that sent him to the
Cleveland Cavaliers as
compensation for the Knicks'
signing of free agent guard .liiii

“I'm not happy to be leaving." he

to liiiish my career in New York.

“When it lirst happened. I was
dejected. I felt I had a good pre-

"It‘s a business. I guess. llicy did

At 32. the seven-time all-star and

"I still enjoy the game. he said.

Junior Fred Kitzrow cameinthird‘
place for Albany in 26:06. And for
the second consecutive meet. he was
named the Danes‘ “runner of the
meet.“ Kitzrow is proving himself as
one of the fastest runners on the
squad. and Saturday‘s victory was
strong evidence.

Kitzrow kept pace with Fisher for
the first three miles. In doing so. he
ran his fiistcst two-mile ever (9:53).
in addition to his top cross-country
clocking at home.

Munsey noted the importance of
Kit/row‘s staying with Fisher; “This
had a tremendous effect on our
guys." Kit/row was pleased with his
running. and his teammates. as well.
“I had a good liniin ltliought.“ said
Kit/row. "It was good looking back
and seeing all Albany."

Reilly is just a lrosh. but is not
