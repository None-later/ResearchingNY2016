Council Adopts Stipend Policy

by Stuart Vincent

I Central Council passed a new SA
stipend policy on Wednesday
lollowing discussion by Council
members.

The policy. which had first been
shown to the Council last
Wednesday. was again presented by
members of the internal Affairs
Committee of SA in charge of
drafting the policy.

According to Abbie liavkins.
ltead of the comtnittcc. the policy
will go into effect immediately after
it is signed by SA President Dave
(itild.

Opposition to the policy at the
Council meeting stemmed primarily
trottt lllt feelings of certain members
that no stipends should be awarded
at all.

"Some people can‘t feel that
students should get stipends." said
Central Council Chairman Mike

arraiitgment belore judge John
Cyne. Alter an eight hour trial last
week. lie was found ttot guilty ol'the
charge.

lienccke said he wasn't surprised
about the “not guilty" \erdict the
tiny at Albany County Court
handed down last Ihursday at his
trial lor allegedly takittg over 51.000
liottt the class of'7tl lelethoit party.

".No. i expected it." said iiencckc
" l here just wasn't enough evidence
to convict me."

llte promissory note ltad been
introduced as evidence. but
according to Benecke. Judge John
Cly tie dismissed it as being irrelevant
to the ease and asked the jury to
strike it from their minds.

Henccke said the reason fut ttot
turning himself into the police last
year on the day scheduled was that “I
needed time to set tip a defense. I
think Unitersity l’oliee mishandled
the whole operatiuti. lltey were in it
\ cry persectitiunist iitood
throughout the wltole thing.“

.

Lissncr. “They feel that they would
work for other reasons. like the
emotional rewards from working for
the groups.“

According to Abbie. Havkind.
several changes were made in the
policy as a result of input from
Council members at last
Wednesday's meeting.

“In the case where people were
getting small stipends such as 550.
they didn‘t feel that it was right not
to allow tltcm to have part—time
jobs.“ said llavkins. “The policy was
changed so that persons cannot hold
an outside job if they receive a
stipend of over $l50.“

Another clause that was added to
the original proposed policy reads:
"lbe stipend shall be paid in
monthly sllotittents. In the evcttt the
person becomes dctacltcd from the
group either formally or informally
the Committee shall have the power

the significance ot'last Thursday‘s
court ruling "hasn‘t bit ttte yet." he
said. "l‘nt glad it‘s over. Hopefully
people who \\t.'l'L‘ interested iit seeing
this thing go to the real courts are
satisfied. if it hadn't goitc to court.
the class would hate iiltttost all the
ittottey by now."
lienecke said lie stopped making
the payments on the advice of his
lawyer because it wotild "complicate
the coun case."
Sorry
"l‘m sorry for all the trouble I‘ve
caused anybody laculty. students.
administration. it I eter return [to
SUleA] I'd like to ltlltltL‘ a
contribution to make it a better
school." said lleneeke.
Iienecke said he had considered
rctipplying to SUN YA realizing that
"there wouldn't be readjustment
problems acadentically. but there
would be socially. Socitilly it would
be an interesting experience."
lteapplying to .s'tl NYA. he said. was
"alttays a possibility."

to terminate the stipend."

“The great thing about this policy
is that the Stipend Committee will be
able to determine whether or not a
person will get a stipend according to
set guidelines." said Lissner. “The
committee has the option of not
giving someone a stipend at all.“

"T he vote was pretty close,“ said
Havkins. "A lot of members

switliehed their votes at the last
minute. This was a controversial
issue attd there was a good debate
going on until the policy was finally
passed."

Finance

According to the approved policy.
the Finance Comtttittce of SA shtdl
continue to deal with all financial
matters interttal to SA except for
stipends arid intercollegiate
athletics.

lhe stipend to be awarded to the
top tltrec SA executives was kept at
522.50 lor the yearand $l.04| forttte
summer for the President. Vice-
l’resident, and Controller. The
Central Council Chairperson will
also be receiving $522.50 for the
year.

According to the policy. these
amounts will he considered fixed
subject to a yearly retiew by Central
Council.

Applications for stipends will be
announced within one tnontlt of the
formation of the committee. the
policy says.
