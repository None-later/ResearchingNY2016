The SUNYA green buses may be'

CDTA takes over the student

\ssistant Vice President of Business

Chason said that Stony Brook is

or their campus. He said that their.
)rescnt inventory of six buses is not
idequate and that “we do have
:omplaints from studetns about the
misting service." said Chason.

According to Chason. Stony
Brook will use the buses l'ortheir one
route on campus. which extends
from the “South l’ Lot“ to Main
Campus. and includes a stop at the
railroad station. The buses are used
mostly by commuter students. The
sprawling layout ofthe Stony Brook
campus necessitates a bus routejust
[or on campus. said Chason.

Stony Brook Head of General
Institutional Services Peter
lie-Maggot said that SIJNYA first
made the proposal last year. He also
said that since last spring. SUNYA

Charon stressed that Stony Brook
“has not progressed on negotiations
with Albany and that there have only
been hriet’ discussions.“

In recent years. according to
Chason. Stony Brook has used

purchasing arrangement. and
became Stony Brook‘s property
after five years‘ rental. '

Coyne said. “This past session we
persuaded the Assembly leadership
not to move the bills. We‘re working
toward a way to raise benefits l'orthc

In addition to the uneven effects of
the benefits. the lack of ﬁscal
accountability of private colleges is a
drawback. said Coyne.

“There is a need for uniform
system of accounting among the
independent colleges and there is a
need for the State to inspect their

Balloonist Failure
Def/ates Ego

HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA (AP)
the second American attemptin five
weeks to cross the Atlantic by
balloon has ended off the coast of
Canada. and the skipper rif'the
balloon Eagle reports he is
“stunt-what embarrassed“ and nearly
5250.000 poorer. But he says he will
try again next year.

The Canadian Coast Guard ship
l’rovo Wallis picked up Dewey
Reinhard. 47. and navigator Steve
Stephenson, 44. from their gondola
30 miles off Nova Scotia late
Wednesday afternoon.

lhe men. who took from Bar
Harbor, Maine. on Monday. were
cold. wet and tired but otherwise in
good condition.

At least l4 prmious attempts to
cross the ocean by balloon have
ended in failure. and some of the
halloonists have died. The last
previous attempt. by two men from
Albuquerque. NM. ended Sept. l2
ol'l Iceland.

Reinhard in a telephone interview
said he was “very disappointed and
somewhat embarrassed."

“We didn‘t llv very for after
putting so much effort. time and
money into this thing." he said. But
"we‘ll be back next year. The system
worked perfectly. ltjust needs to be
line luned. But maybe it'll be a little
earlier next year."

Reinhard said difficulty in picking
up weather broadcasts. bad weather
and trouble with the bailasting
system caused them to abort the

‘tlight. Ilc explained that it was

raining. with 30-mile winds. the
gondola had hit the water at least a
dolen times in two days. and they
were drilling toward land. north of
their route.
