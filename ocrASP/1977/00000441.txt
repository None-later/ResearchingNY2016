“One reason why i might come
here instead of Planned Parenthood
is because i know that Planned
Parenthood is so ‘pill‘-oriented.‘ “

“I was misdiagnosed twice and a
friend of mine was misdiagnosed
with serious complications
(subsequent hospitalization); the
costs were exhorbitant for a student
and the doctor‘s attitude was as ill

“I buy all my contraceptives ru

am outraged by what i see as an
incomplete haphazard attempt at

forced to enter these doors a nd trust
the judgement of the physicians
there blindly. I don't feel the chem

An Augusta. Georgia. man. who
apparently had second thoughts
about surgery he was about to
undergo. leaped off an operating
table. raced down hospital corridors
with nurses and orderlies in pursuit.
and escaped earlier this week.

The unidentified patient was later
picked up by Augusta police several
blocks from the hospital. They had
spotted him sprinting along the
sidewalk attired only in a surgical
gown.

According to St. Joseph Hospital.
the patient explained later that he
changed his mind about the pending
surgical procedure after being given
prc—op medication and wheeled into
surgery. H ospual ol'fictals saythc 25-
year-old patient had been scheduled
to be crrcumswed.

According to Phillips. “Operation

manufaaure millions of oversized

Phillips says the memo explained
that. after the airdrop. Soviet males
would findthe contraceptives fartoo

discover words printed on each one
