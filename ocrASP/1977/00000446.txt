tum for example. when she says:“. . . if there
 only 65,“ women in N.0.W. and
“non; of women in ERA groups all overthe

bunny. why doea the feminist movement at '

all the coverage — completely ignoring-the
trillions in other feminist groups all over the
‘mmryf What Ted Smith was speaking
mm was not that the feminist groups were
king ignored. nor that the “feminist
movement gets all the coverage", but rather
dial the media tends to take the actions of a
relatively small group. and treat them as if
they were the most important one.

Smith does not lecture as if “no one in the
class reads. watches. observes critically.”
Rather. he encouragcsthc class to watch. read.
and observe more critically. One homework
assignment. for example. was to watch the
evening news broadcast. who had watched the
news that night. could not name one story.
Tcd Smith shows that people in general do not
observe critically. but in this class. at least. he
islrying to do something about it.

It is'unfortunate that Ted Smith likes small
classcs. In his years here. he will probably
never have one. I hopc that they schcdulc his
Propaganda coursc this spring in LC-lil,
bcctiusc, this article not withstanding. the
word is going out that fed Smith is a cut above
the avcrzigc drivcl. One student. in support of
Smith; responded in class to the article by
presenting 'l‘cd Smith with a Clgilrcllc. It
lookcd like it had tobacco inside . . . .

the
apology

To the Editor:

In regards to an articlc that appcarcd in last
Friday‘s ASI’ titlcd. "ch Smith: ('oming
Down on lhc Media." I wrotcit and lch thull
must make an apologyto Dr. Smith andlothc
class in RCO 238. I did not intcnd charactcr
as .sination which is what has been rcad into
lhc t'irticlc by many. llut rcgardlcss of my
intentions. I atn rcsponsiblc for what I wrotc
and as such I must answer the chargcs against
what l have writtcn.

thn thc ttrticlc was written) four wccks
ago. I lcll that n largc number of sludcnts
tigrcctl With my position that ilr. Smith's bias
rcndcl‘cd llllll incilcclnc as it tctichcr of M ass
Mcdia. Obviously. according to it poll liikL'i’l in
class this past Monday. I “as wrong. An
overwhelming majority lch that Dr. Smith
and l arc worlds apart and it is that gtill which
did not allow the to llcttl’ past his bias. I still
lind much in Dr. Smith's teaching that I find
dillicult to takc but that is it pcrsonal problcm
and obviously mic that thc majority of thc

. class docsn‘t share. lhcrc arc many issues

ritiscd by this incident (unfortunately lhc
situation has csctiialcd to that point) bill I Will
kccp to thc immcdiatc oncs; l)r. Smith‘s
reputation and that ol lhc other st udcnls in lhc
class.

As previously stated. hc is obvioust
'llcciivc Ior a large majority ol the students so
ill apology must hc made to tbc class for
liarcprcscntation (although unintcndcdl of
hair vrcws.

' My own journalistic devices and slylc scctn
~ have brought upon inferences about Dr.
‘miths personal chaructcr. an arca I certainly
ould ncvcr touch upon. and for those
nlcrcnccs I am of course rcsponsihlc. l have
to comments regarding Dr. Smith as a man
ind am ccrtuinly in no position to have any,

My views about the manner Ill which Dr,
'initli conducts a class have not changed. they
r" "W own and its suclil will dclcutl them. but
iicc now in what has been an incrcdiblc lesson
but a writer is responsible for wlnitcvcr comes
it his choice of words. Simply in the hlililc way
lllil I lch Dr. Smith‘s bins affects him. so did
"Ell Own binscs ttl‘fcct my article. l‘rom lllc

tconccptimn and discomfort I have catith
1 am sorry.

To the Etitor:

As residents of thc'Country Squire Motel.
we would like to inform students at SUNYA
of our situation and to correct any previous
inaccuracies reported.

Students housed at the CSM find
transportation not only inadequate but also
falling to meet the written and verbal
contractual agreements made between
ourselves and the management. Students were
promised a munimum often to twelve per day
between the CSM and the campus. Currently.
lcwcr than ten trips are provided on weekdays
and only towirips on \vcckcnds. Fun hermorc.
thc current charge of twenty-five cents bcing
lcucd on students for a (inc-way trip to or
Irom campus cxcccds the previously agreed
upon SIS monthly rutc for unlimited \an
scnicc. lllc cost lll\'(ll\|:d prevcnts students
from trtncling back to their room bclwccn
classes to rclttx or study and lorccs them to
rcmain on campus from hrcakfast until
dinncr. lhc limiicd \ilil scr\ icc functions as a
barrier bctwccn studcnts at ihc CSM and
those on campus. as it prohibits us Irom
aitcndiiig social merits in the melting and on
\scckcnds. It also limits studcnts ttsc of thc
library on thc \vcckcnds.

Anotlicr major conccrn of the students
residing at the (‘SM is lhc lack ol‘conccrn on
tlic part of thc managcmcnt concerning firc
salcty. 'I'hcrc arc no lirc extinguishch or fire
alarm systcms t0 alcrt both sludcnts and thc
lirc department in tlic cvcnt of a ﬁre or other
cmcrgcncy. Students at the CSM .wcrc
astonished to read in last Friday's ASI’thai
thc motcl management fclt that thcrc were
more pressing intittcrs than lirc safety. The
question asked by all of the students housed at
lhc motel is: “Can you namc one?" Wc have
considered many:

Could it bc lhc lact that thcrc Is no

Surveying Sexuality Services

Looking over the results of the Women’s Health Services] Human
Sexuality Survey, there scents to be quite a bit of negative feedback on'
SUNYA‘s own offerings.

It can be argued, of course, that the questionnaire was biased towards
that end. and that by the very nature of the survey it would draw out
more complaints than compliments. Which is why the results printed in
today‘s issue should not be read as the hard and fast viewpoint of the
student body. But as an uncontrolled sampling of opinion, it is valuable.

Immediately obvious is the fact that Planned Parenthood consistently
comes out on top of the list; a place SUNYA's clinic should hold. A
closer examination of exactly why students prefer P. P. and what
services they offer above and beyond the SUNYA clinic is certainly in
order.

There also appears to be a lack of useful services on campus in the area
of sexuality counseling. More than half of the students who answered
had never used an on-campus group or program for sex-related
problems. And of those who had. approximately half went to Middle
Earth. Which is line. but Middle Earth shouldn't be expected to handle
the counscling load of an entire university.

As several of the respondents pointed out. the need for preventative
nrcasurcs is just as pressing as the need for a center to handle problems.
lhrough mass distribution of information on birth control. for
cxamplc. students may find it less cmbarassing and less frightening to
walk into the reputedly “pill-oriented" offices of the SUNYA clinic or
Planned Parenthood and ask for a diaphragm.

Anothcr type of information is just as urgently needed, howcvcr
information on exactly what kind of services are available on campus.
The most surprising aspect of the survey responses was the widespread
confusion bctwccn thc SUNYA Health Center and thc SUNYA
Contraceptive Clinic. Too many people either lumped the twotogethcr.
mistook one for the other. or were totally unaware of the existence of
cithcr one.

So improving the health/sexuality services at SUNYA is only a part‘
ol'tlic battlc. Information is essential; ifstudents know what is available
to thcm. what they have to do and whcrcthcy havctogotogct ii. a good
proportion of the problems they face now could well b' allcviatcd.
