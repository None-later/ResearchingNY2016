so 'I won't have to come back to this
place. We are sittingducks out there.

. I'll tell you the truth '— l was scared
r to death,” German added. .

The game came close to turning

into a- fan uprising in the latter
innings with a half-dozen spectators

ﬁeld and being chased by security
ofﬁcers.

A smoke bomb, which trailed
Itreams of green smoke, was tossed
into right-center ﬁeld near the 385-
foot mark, obscuring outﬁeldcrs
from the crowd of 56,69l.

Outﬁelder Reggie Smith of the
Dodgers was struck on the head bya
hard rubber ball as the game ended.
and he went to the locker room
complaining of “spasms down my
neck and back.

“They were throwing apples. beer
cans, rubber balls and anything they
could get their hands on.“ Smith
said. “It was ridiculous."

Yankee Stadium security ofﬁcers
announced that nine people had
been arrested for "criminal
trespass.“ an offense which carries a
maximum ﬁne of $l00.

The extra-curricular show began
midway in the seventh inning when a
young man leaped from the stands
near the Dodgers dugout and madea
perfect hook slide into home plate.
