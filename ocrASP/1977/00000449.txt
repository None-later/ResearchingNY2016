.1, Remembering the say-Hey Kid 

‘ try: Mainel’st'elii

The pitcher was doing well. He

.was working on it shut out in the
ninth inning. (l was only in fourth
grade. yet I still remember all the
details. like whotlié' pitcher was. but
that isn't important.)

3 .Willie Mays led off the bottom of
the'ninth. Mays was my father's fa-
vorite player. the man to whom he
attributed the mild remnant of the
fanaticism he once had for the
Giants. Willie poked the ﬁrst pitch of
the inning through the middle. took
that wide turn he took so many
hundreds of times before. and held
up with asingle. potentially lhelying

un.

r Willie McCovey then banged a
pitch between ﬁrst and second.
Mays, ﬂying with the pitch. routtded
second. and streaked toward third.
The rightﬁelder madethe long throw
to third base. which Mays easily
beat.

And then Willie Mays showed
what made him Willie Mays. To the
bewilderment of every player on the
field. he lcft the base. and raced
toward the plate. Caught flatfooted.
about to return the ball to the
pitcher, the thirdbascman hesitated
before gaining the presence of mind
to throw the ball to the catcher.
Mays slid under the tag with iltc
tying run. .his coach at third base
took his hands away from his eyes.
McCovey took second base. and, ol
course. scored the winning run
moments later.

The energetic six-year old threw
the ball up as ltigh as ltc cottld. llis

mitt was too big for him. as was the
ciip which virtually covered his nose.
He ran underneath the ball. ratlter
ungracefully. but caught it
nonetheless. Dusk Wits setting as he
threw the bull tti the other side of his
yard. and chased after it: he

_ purposely tltrcw it to a distant area.

forcing himself to run at top speed to
tnakc tltc catch.

The child's birthday party had
ended an hour earlier. and he was
alone with his new gift from the
instant the lust ofhis friends left until
long alter the street lights were
turned on. His new glove had Willie
Mays‘ autograph on it. and he knew
that it was exactly the same mitt
Willie Mays used. for he had seen
Willie Mttys‘ hands on television.
attd they were very big. and this
glove was i -ry hit. so it stood to
reason that it was tltc samc glove.

older brother.

We arrived at the lecture early so '

that we could get ﬁrst row seats. We
got third row seats. There was a 25
minute wait until Jimmy Breslin was
to start speaking. I turned to Dave.
lightly disgusted ut the length ofour
wait. and said. “You know. ill was
to make it list of all the peopleinthis
world I Would like to see, .limmy
Brcslin would not be in the top one
hundred."
“Who would be?" he asked me.
“Well. ﬁrst would be Willie Mays

“You mean to tell me that you'd
rather see Willie Mays speak than
Jimmy Breslin‘!“ he asked in
disbelief.

“I'll bet that if Willie Mays was in

From the ﬁrst time I had

and said. “Say hcy! You're a Mays

slapped his hand. and proceeded to
icntiitiscc about lhc“good old days."
as Mays had been retired for over
two years and was now relegated to

on a trivia contest about our idol.

“What was his batting averttgc the

replied instantly. Not even waiting

in the bottom of the ninth inning.
Willie Mays, who had doubled
Mtitty Alou over to third base. was
the possible winning run. Willie
McCovey slammed the ﬁrst pitch. so
hard that only one person knew
where it had been hit: Bobby
Richardson. the Yankees second
baseman. who. unfortunately forthe
(iiants. was holding the line drive
shot in his mitt. This mitt covered the
same hand that the championship
ring would be resting on only
seconds later. Al Dark. the Giants
llltlilllgcl‘. was asked by a reporter if
the velocity with which the ball had
hccn liit may have prevented Willie

ll'tiltl scoring even if the ball had.

gotten through Richardson.

“ll that ball got through.” Dark
answered. "Willie Mays would have
been inth clubhouse. showered and
dressed hclore the throw reached
home!"

The little h0ny mother called the
birthday  in "from the dark.
lleads of perspiration flushed his
