by David Spiro

The Albany State Varsity tennis
team dropped a narrow S4 decision
at the hands of the Coast Guard-
Academy, Wednesday at home.

The match was the last of the
season for the Danes. coming in the
wake of their surprising second-
place ﬁnish in the SUNYAC
Championships. last weekend.

This week the Danes weren‘t
nearly as successful.

“We're a much better team than
we showed today,” said head coach
Bob Lewis. “We were missing ﬁve of
our players and it hurt as."

Paul Feldman, who last weekend
won the SUNYAC number one
singles title for the third year in a
row. continued his winning ways. as
he defeated Scott Reynolds in
straight sets. 6-2. 6-0.

Mike Fenig. the number two
player for Albany. also won his
match in straight sets. defeating Joe
Loadholt 6-3. 6-0.

The other singles matches all
ended in defeat for Albany. Gene
Gillespie lost to Joe Rodriquez 6-0.
3-6. 6-4. David Gutlove was defeated
by Brian Ford 6-3. 6—4. and Dave
McMullen lost to Jim VandeVoord.
also by the score of (r3, 644.

The sixth and ﬁnal singles match
went to Coast Guard. when Albany
forced to default.

Feldman and Fertig. who won the
SUNYAC doubles title. won again.
defeating Reynolds and Loadholt 6-
3. 6—4. Al Berger and Derrick Rubin
.also took their doubles match.
beating Rodriquez and Ford 6-3. 7-

’ In the deciding match of the day.

Gillespie and McMullen lost to Rob
Sindle and Vinnie Mitchell 6-4.6-4.

Coach Lewis was far from pleased
with the team's performance. “1 was
very disappointed with the attitude
of some of the players on the team."
said Lewis. He was referring to the
fact that three of his players were not
on time for the match because of
"minor conflicts."

“The players could have ironed
them out. if they had more loyalty
and dedication to the team." added
Lewis.

Albany‘s ﬁnal record for the fall
season was 3~2. “This team has the
potential for a ﬁne spring season."
said Lewis. “However. the players
who are unwilling to make a deﬁnite
commitment to the team. will not be
allowed to play tennis." concluded
Lewis.

The Red Dragons‘ offense.
however. will pose a threat to the
Danes‘ defense. which has not
yielded a touchdown in ihelast three
games. “Cortland has a good offense
which will challenge us tomorrow."
said Albany Head Coach Bob Ford.

The Red Dragons are guided by
quarterback Greg Didio. and he‘s a
good one. according to assistant
coach Jack Sicdlicki. "Didio has a
rettl good arm and I would rank him
just behind Curt Dempsey of St.
Lawrence." said Siedlicki. Dempsey
was the top passer in the tration last
year.

The two men who carry the ball
for Cortland are Mark Barbano and
Lyle Schuler who both returned to.

year.

Schuler is the man the Danes are
going to have to contain tomorrow.
The tailback gained |20 yards last
week using his quick speed. "Last
year. Schuler was probably the best
running back that faced us." said
Siedlicki. “He‘s it ‘money‘ runner."

The other mttn t he Duties will have

For the Danes. the week off crime

However. they aren‘t fully

meeting between the committee and
motel management since students
drew tip it lormal grievance petition
two weeks ttgtr.

'l'lntt petition listed complaints in
eight general areas trf living con-
ditions at the motel. Students had
previously cotnpluincd of inade-
quate transportation arrangements
to and from the campus. and their
petition added complaints about
security. room conditions. and
telephone service. among others.
