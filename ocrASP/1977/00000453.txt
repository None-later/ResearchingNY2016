V Tobacco Kills ButMakes Money 

(PNS) A heated controversy over
continued federal price supports for
the tobacco industry had heightened
into a war of powerful and per-
suasive lobbyists on both sides —in-
cluding two Cabinet departments
pitted against each other.

As of Aug. 3| this year, govern-
ment loans t'or tobacco supports
equalled $664 million v nearly $200
million more thttn the previous year.

Once again. opponents of these
price supports are insisting that the
government justify the morality of
programs contributing to the
prosperity of a "death-dealing" in-
dustry that sold Americans 626.7
billion cigarettes last year. And once
again tobacco‘s defenders are rolling
out the formidable economic
arguments that have beaten brick
other clialletiges to the 44-year-old
tobacco support system.

Joseph A. Calil'ano. Jr.. Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare
(l'lliW). said recently that the
government should not employ price
supports in “make it less expensive
for people to buy something that's
going to give them emphysema. lirng

cancer or heart disease.“

The Dcpanmcnt of Agriculture
disagrees. and President Caner has
been noncommittal. But HEW ap-
parently is studying ways to launch
Califano‘s promised “strong tlnll-
smoking campaign."

The campaign will have to be per-
suasive to undercut support for art
industry that protects itself with
facts like these:

0|.ast year. federal, state and local
governments collected more than $6
billion in revenues from tobacco
purchases; more than 98 per cent of
that amount came from taxes on the
sale of cigarettes.

I'l'obacco provided 52.] billion in
farm income last year: North
Carolina alone earned $999 million
from tobacco in I976. Kentucky
$482 million; as many as 050.000
farmers (nobody is certain of the ex-
act number) depend on tobacco. the
“debt paying crop." as a source of
cash. for many their only source.

ONo other crop yields nearly as
much money as tobacco.

A Kentucky farmer with a one-
acre patch of well-kept burlcy can

eiirn as much as $3.000 at harves
time for his small crop. There is little
doubt that without a crop of equal
profitability, many farmers — es-
pecially those working small farms

in the South and Southeast —~ would .

have to go out of business if federal
price supports were eliminated and
tobacco income dropped drastically.

But now the opponents of price
supports have ttn economic Weapon
ol' their own —« the growing drain on

the federal treasury from the ac- ,

eumulation of tobacco surpluses in
already bulging Department of
Agriculture-lino need storehouses.

Last year the Department of
Agriculture's Commodity Credit
Corporation bought. in accord with
price support policy. the 6.7 per cent
of the tobacco crop that did not sell
at support levels. This tobacco.
much of it dirty or ol'irifcrior' grade.
was added to art already heavy stir-
plus.

As a result. a recent editorial in
Tobacco Reporter said tobacco was
an “industry under siege." in danger
of losing government subsidies
because of t he accumulation ol'cost-

lysurpluscs that might never be sold
to manufacturers.
Since I933 the year tobacco
was designated a basic coriimodity
- federal supports have been used
to increase tobacco farmers‘ income
and to even out market fluctuations
by controlling the amount of tobac-

allowed to grow only a'cerlain
amount ol' tobacco: in return they

If it weren't l'or the connection

system for tobacco could be con-
sidered to have been remarkably

pounds than in l94fL Yet the I975
crop was sold for $463.8 million.
while the W40 crop was sold for only
$Io9.4 million.

Neither side knows exactly what
consequences might lollo\\ the
abolishing of tobacco price sup-
ports.
