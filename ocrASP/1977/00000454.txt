who recently lost a landmark legal
decision involving unmnrrieds living

on his former living mute.

Marvin has filed it SI million suit
against Michelle 'I‘rioln. the woman
he lived with for six years. charging
that she owcs him SI inillion for his
services its a housckccpcr and com-
pnnion.

'I'riola had recently demanded
that it sum its ptirt ot'thc scttlcmcnt
she has requested tiftcr their six-year
joint-living arrangement fell apart.

Marvin‘s ncw suit contends that
cvcryonc is equal undcr the law: his
suit argues that if ’I'riolti can claim
she was worth $| million to him its a
housckccpcr and companion. the
rcvcrsc is tilso truc.

In the earlier Marvin-Tricia deci-

sion, the Culifomitt Supreme Court
ruled that unmarried people living
together sometimes have the slime
Icgiil obligations to each other its do
