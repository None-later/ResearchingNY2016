The Albany State varsity baseball
team ended its season on a disap-
pointing note last Friday by losing a
doubleheader to Binghamton by
identical 3-2 scores.

Perhaps the ﬁrst inning ofthe ﬁrst
game was an indication of what kind
of day it would be for the Danes.

With the help of the Binghamton

"pitcher, Albany mounted a scoring

threat as Paul Nelson. Howie
Markowitz. and Mike George. the
ﬁrst three Dane batters. all walked.

the opportunity handed them as
Rick Cardillo and Chris Sieglcr both
were struckout and Roger Planticr
grounded out.

Binghamton wasted no time
against Dane pitcher Steve Muldoon
as the first batter in the bottom ofthe
ﬁrst tripled. and was then brought
home on a sacrifice fly.

Both teams played scoreless
baseball over the next fourinnings.

Binghamion came close to adding
to their l-(l lead in the bottom ofthe
fourth. With two outs Binghamton
loaded the bases on an error by Dane

shortstop Al Grimaldi and two
walks by Muldoon. Muldoon came
back to end the inning by forcing
Binghamton‘s third baseman to fly
out to Markowitz in rightﬁe‘ld.

Albany tied the score in the top of
the sixth. With one out Plantier
singled. advaneedaround tothird on
an error. and scored on a sacriﬁce ﬂy

In the top of the seventh Albany
took the lead. With two out George

Binghamton came up in the bot-

tom of the seventh in need of a

baserunner. and they got one from a
single with one out. The runner then
stole second. but the next batter
grounded out. leaving Albany one
out away from victory.
