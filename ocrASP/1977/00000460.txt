Dodgers were happy to be back in"
New York for Tuesday night's sixth
game of the I977 World Series
against the Yankees. ' -

The Dodgers. whistling past the
graveyard. jolted the Yankees Ill-4
Sunday. preventing New York from
clinching the world championship
and keeping the Series going. The
victory meant I! return to Yankee
Stadium. which wasn‘t a very con-

genial place the last time Lori
Angclcs visited.

Disorderly fans left the ﬁeld
strewn with debris after last Wednes-
day night's second game. Several
missiles were hurled at players and
some connected.

“I can‘t speak for the other guys.“
said Dodger second baseman Davey
Lopes. “but speaking for myself. I‘m
gonna wear a hard hrit otit there."

Shortstop Bill 'Russcll agreed. “I
take thtit seriously. delinitcly. 'l'hey
do not have enough security there to
control it." he said. "Fans like that
don‘t deserve it hall cluh there the
way they act.“

Dusty Halter. who had three hits in
Sunday‘s lil'th game. admitted he
“as it little wary of the fans. "I just
hope they‘re all nice.“ he said. "I
wouldn‘t throw rtt anybody and l
ltopc they don't thrtru at me."
