"  that he iii quite a player.

In ‘ two and a ' fiqu years of
collegiate tennis. Paul Feldmun has
compiled a 52-6 record with four of
those losses coming in’ tournament

‘play.

Both his present coach. Robert
Lewis and his coach during iris
freshman year. Merle Hathaway. say
l-‘cldman is the best plttycrtbey him-
ever seen at Albiiny State.

Among the accomplishments
f‘eldmau has made in his three years.
perhaps the one that stands ottt most
is his three consecutive titles iii the
SUNYAC Championships. Only
one other player in the history of the
tournament has accomplished that
feat. '

When Fcldman first came to
Albany in I975. he had no idea that
two and a half years later. he would
ltavc such an outstanding record.
“My main goal when I came to
Albany was just to be the number
one Player on the team.“ said field-
man. And he made it.

in his first year. Fcldman only lost
two matcltes. ()ne of them was to
Colgatc's Rich l‘inn. “l’inn was the
better player and I wasn‘t really sur-

. most sutisfyingfor him. He compiled

 

prised that if lost,“ said Feldman.
Feldman‘s second your was the

 

u 2l-2 record which is an all time
Albany record for most wins in If
single year. “I really enjoyed the se-
cond year. especially the spring
season.“ said the Albany junior.
"The competition is mtrch better in
the spring. During the fall season. I
would rate the competition as fair."
said f‘eldman.

The highlight of first year was
Feldinun‘s rematch with Him. He in-
dicated he really wanted to win that
matclt and he did. "It was the most
satisfying match ol'thc year for me.“
said Feldmtin.

The thingthat makes l‘eldnian so
good is his attitude. according to
Coach Lewis. "l’aul‘s greatest tll-
tribtitc is he is an outstanding coin-
petitor." said Lewis. "Also he is very
quick and anticipates very well and
just thinks alltbetinieonthe eonrt."

When Feldiiiiin takes totlie court.
his attitude varies depending on his
opponent. "ll'l know I‘m upaguinst
someone who can beat me. I really
concentrate very hard." he said. “lfl
know I can beat my opponent a lot of

times I just go out there and practice
some of my week she said Fold.

“man.” -. I‘ i ‘. .L \ ' v i

. One problem that faces Pttul is the
luck of high quality competition ac-
cording to Coach Lewis; But Lewis
feels that in the spring. some of his
toughest competition will come from
histenmmute Larry Linett. Linett is
a transfer from Union College where
he was the number one player. Last
year the two met in a dual meet and it
was a match that Lewis labelled
typical of the type of game that Paul
plays.

Feldman trailed three games to
none in the second set. alter losing
the first set and appeared on waon a
defeat. However. he ptrt his game
together and won ll of the next l5
games to take the matclt.

Feldman. ltowevcr. indicated that
he doesn‘t want to ntakc a career iIi
tennis. "1 never even thought of'
becoming a tennis pro." l‘eldman is
an accounting major. but presently is
undecided on what he wants to do
when he graduates next year.

Before he graduates. he still has a
semester and a half left oftennis and
a chance of becoming the only player
to win four consecutive SUNYAC
titles. llis coach thinks he cant andso
docs Feldman.

He may be no .liinmy Connors or
llic Nastase. but for l‘cldinitn. that
makes no difference.

When the outcome of a football
game comes down to the last few
minutes. the heroics are usually sav-
ed for an offensive player. But in
Albany State‘s ltl-lS win over Cor-
tltind Saturday. the hero was Albany
linebacker Brad Kehlenbeck.

two minutes. the Red Dragons were
marching into Albany territory
looking for the‘cndlone and the win.

It was on Saturday at the halfway
mark of Cortland‘s live-mile cross
country course. the site of the f977
SUNY Athletic Conference Cham-
pionships. when l’lattsburgb‘s head
coach was shouting encouragement
to his leading runners. “You got it
won. you got it won.“

Well. the barriers from Albany
State were not about to concede. in-
stead. the Danes went on to capture
the coveted title in the final iitile.
winning over eight other squads.

remark. Albany coach Robert
Munsey said. "I thought that was
kind of funny." Alter the meet.
Mtinsey must have been amused at
anything. Insalisfaction til ftis team's
accomplishment.

l’laeitig second out of eight y-one
barriers was Albany's llilf Mathis.
who ran cross cottntry for the first
time in his life last fall. Mathis bases-
tablislicd himself as the best runner
on the squad.

“Last year
presstnc on Inc to prove myself."
noted Mathis. "l sort of sqttee/ed
myself tip there (on \ItI‘\Ily)." flttt
this season. the pressure is gone. and
Mathis is gaining confidence.

Saying“l was shooting for the top
fifteen.“ Mathis was obVIotIsly plctIs<
ed with his race. "I think I‘ll enjoy
this for the rest of the year." Mathis
said.

Mathis and teammate l'ied Kil-
Irow. who finished seventh oierall
and second for the Duties. bIec/ed
through the first two miles lll 9:44. It
was towards the eiid of the meet
though. when Mathis made his
move.

What Munsey called a “tremen-
dous job" was Mutbis‘ lust-mile et-
fort. This put hiin ahead of Uncon-
ttt's Jack Callacio. who ended the
race in third pltiee.
