Space war — now only a movie
fantasy — could add a frightening
new dimension to global conﬂict as
early as the mid-I984“.

The Pentagon has quietly begun
using the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration‘s (NASA)
new Space Shuttle program as a
*stepping stone to build a capability
to ﬁght a war in space.

Military space projects are now
taking up a significant portion of
NASA's planned Space Shuttle mis-
sions. More than 100 of these ﬁrst
560 Shuttle ﬂights will carry U.S.
military satellites and weapons ex-
periments into orbit.

Congressional critics like Wiscon-
sin Dcmocrat William Proxmire
have charged that through the Space
Shuttle program. NASA — the
civilian space agency »-— is becoming
an arm of the Department of
Defense. increasingly subject to
military priorities.

Publicly. most U.S. ofﬁcials are
on record against expanding the

«garms race into space. In a press con-
ference this month Secretary of
Defense Harold Brown stated. "I
would hopethat wecould keep space
from becoming an area of active con—
ﬂict.“

But some military planners are ex-
cited about possible‘ . star wars.
“Space is a‘dandy arena.‘sctu_ally.“

and Astronautics. “You've gotto at-
tract strategic waroff the planet. The
notion of abhorring war in space is
just plain wrong." :

The Pentagon is concerned that

the U.S. is falling behind the Soviets”. ,

in key portions of the “space race."
One Air Force General summarized
the military‘s view of the situation:
“There has never been a transporta-
tion medium in the history of man
that has not been exploited for
economic and military advantage.
Space is not going to he an excep-
tion.“

The Space Shuttle. now being
tested in Southern California. will
allow scientists. private industry and
the military to send large payloads
into orbit on ll weekly basis during
the l980s. The Shuttle system will in-
clude a reusable oribiter that will be
boosted into space by giant rockets
and then glide back to earth landing
like an airplane. The ﬁrst spaceﬂight
for the Shuttle is now scheduled for
I979.

month the Air Force contracted with
the Vought Corporation to build a
test version of the satellite killer.

American intelligence agencies
have reported that the Soviets are
studying the use of lasers and space-
mines. and some defense ofﬁcials are
worried that such Soviet satellite
killers could be a threat to the Space
Shuttle.

0n the U.S. side. NASA com-_
missioned a study last year on the
feasibility of placing a huge array of
mirrors in orbit to reﬂect the energy
of ground-based lasers and shoot
down enemy missiles. The think-
tank envisioned an advanced version
of the Space Shuttle to put the
mirrors in orbit and estimated the
cost of such a system to be $I05
billion.

Congress' ubilit y to control the U.S.

by the inclusion ofthc militaryin the
Space Shuttle program.

“Because the 000 will beentirely
dependent upon NASA‘s transpor-
tation system for space launches.“ a
Council report states. "there is a
danger that in the future NASA
programs will be oriented toward
military. rather than civilian and
scientiﬁc purposes."

Rep. Les Aspin (I).. Wis.) has
claimed that NASA increased the
payload of the Shuttle from 25,000

Force and that Shuttlethrust wallin-
creascd and other technical changes
made in the program at the military‘s
request. .

In a recent interview. Gordon
Adams. ll research associate at the
Council. said that NASA has 
placed in a position where it muslin-
directly subsidilc muny DoD costs.
in I976 the Air Force refused to par-
ticipate in funding the fourth and
fifth Shuttle oribtcrs. “In effect
NASA is carrying the charge for
what they had originally anticipated
being able to share with the Air
Force budget." Adams stated.

Major General Richard D. Henry.
vice commander of the Air Force
research and development agency
for space systems. says “The Shuttle
represents the next threshold for'us-
ing space for vital military and scien-
tific missions. ll' military space
technology can provide reliability
and global information. then our na-
tion can cope with those forces that
are upsetting tltc global
eqllliihrltlm."
