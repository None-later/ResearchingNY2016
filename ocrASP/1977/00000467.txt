4 1 Hello,

By JONATHAN HODGES

The phone rings in an ofﬁce on the
second floor of the administration
building yesterday afternoon. The
secretary smiles and reaches over the
desk. picking tip the receiver.

"Shalom. is this the administration
building at SUNY Albany.“ asks the
caller in an accent that could be classified
as a mixture of pig Iatin and first year
Yiddish.

“Yes it is." replies the secr'etary._iotting
down that this was hertwcnty-seeond call
oi the day.

“'I'his is the Israeli limhassy in New
York." said the caller. “I understand that
the students at your university are
involved in a desperate strtrggle for their
buses‘ existence. I‘hey have their backsto
the Hudson. We at the Israeli Embassy
can understand their struggle. and wish to
express our support for our fellow
patriots at Albany."

“’I hank you.“ answered the secretary.

"Welt. good-bye. I mean. shalom.“

Yesterday afternoon. the Strident
Unioni/ation Movement launched a
phone-in. hoping to tie up every phone in
the adminstration building as part of a
day long protest against the proposed
(‘I.)'|‘A bus takeover. While the bulk of
the callers talked about (‘I)'I'A issues. a
good percentage spent the afternoon

Much as we may not like it. publishing
is a business. Because of this. it is subject
to the whims of popularity in this case.
more specifically. of marketability and
less to artistic demands whatever they
may be. Science Fiction has been gaining
ground for decades. btit all of a sudden
or so it seems there has been a
mammoth boom in the publication of
science fiction and science fiction-related
books. Some new companies. new
imprints. and in some cases old
companies have started science fiction
litres within the last year or two.

In the midst of the boom in production
there is. in man) ways. a bust in terms of
quality. When Marketing shouts they
need more st to push rrrto eager hands.
and the editors run out of good sl. they

"Some of them talk about CDTA."
said Alice 'l‘orda. secretary to Dean for
Student Affairs Neil Brown. "Ilut that's
not a rule. Ijust got offthe phone with
someone who wanted to order a pizza."

“Of course not.“ said the outraged
'lorda. “I told him that I'd like to order
one too.“

While 'alls flooded every office of the

things got to the point where all the lines
were placed on permanent hold.

“There was nothing else I could do.“
stated Karen |.cn1crise. who mans Acting
SUNYA President Vincent ()‘l.eary‘s
outer office.

While I.ernerise expressed helplessness
at the situation. it was mixed with a little
lrnstration and anger.

“If there was an emergency." explained
|.emerise. “there could he definite
problems. Something would have to be
done.“

()‘l.eary‘s personal secretary Jance
Mona ha n fended questions by
announcing that she “had just gotten
back from lunch."

Asked if she would answer her phone.
Monahan replied. “Sure. but it depends if
anyone calls me.“

great.

I his is. of course. a gross
mersimplifieation. like most people
w riter's especially I wonder how sortie
books got into print at all. no ruattcr what
the economic climate. A look at any best—
seller list is a real ctiusc for befuddlement.
So to restate the problem. there are good
and bad books at all times. but during a
boonr period it is easy to assign blarneto
the above-mentioned economic factors.
And so I shall.

Secretaries In the Administration Building answered phone calls all afternoon
yesterday. They were at the receiving end oi a telephone tie-up campaign
launched to protest the proposed CDTA takeover of bus service.

While ()‘Ieary‘s office nrade the
decision to simply ignore the calls. the
office of Vice President for Business and
l-inanee .lolrri llartignn. a central figure
in the CD I A issue. attempted to ride the
wave of calls.

Ilrc normally quiet. efficiently run
office was alive and noisy yesterday as
both secretary‘s answered phone calls. the

about various points in the current
