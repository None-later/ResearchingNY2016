of one‘s career. what do you do for the
following decades? Isaac Asimov has
reported how frustrating it is to he told by
some admirer that “Nightfall” is their
favorite story -- one he wrote when he
was 20! 'l'hcrc are three options: retire.

a Big Name and not necessarily a Good
Writer or one can try to surpass the
work of the past. l‘rcd l’ohl is one ofthe
'lcw sf writers that have been able to do
this successfully.

(r'ulcn'ay is an incredibly rich book.
The situation is this: there is an asteroid
called Gateway. and inside that asteroid is
an alien base hundreds of thousand of
years old. complete with thousands of
starships. most of which are still in good
working order. l’hc problem is that the
only waon find out if a shipis workingis
to get in and try ll out: if it works
properly. the ship makes its way for
anot her location in space. lfit doesn‘t. the
occupant usually dies by any number of
mcans. lltc exciting part is that the ships
are prc‘programmcd. l‘he occupant never
knows where he or she is going. or how

and there were no means of rapid
communication. An important role. from
earliest times on. was played by heralds:

Heralds could do more than deliver

long it takes to get there. The ship could
stop in the fringes of a nova that didn‘t
exist when the original builders
programmed the ship or the occupant
could starve to death before the
destination is reached.

Gateway is run by a corporation that
pays off in cash the value of information
or artifacts the volunteer star-pilots bring
back. like coal mining corporations.
most of the pilots are little more titan
indentured servants. Robinctte
Broadhcad (“in spite ofwhich l atn male")
tries the romantic life of a star-pilot and
finds the dirt and corruption and tragedy
that the public doesn‘t hear abotlt. He
comes away with histrcasure. but at great
cost to himself.

It is a very real. very moving book. Not
only is Broadhcad a three-dimensional
character. hilt the society in which he
exists sccms genuine. too. l'he book has
been compared to so-called “serious”
mainstream work in major reviews. is
high up on the Nebula recommendations
list. and hopefully will prove a ﬁnancial
success as well. My thanksto I’ohl and St.

times. 'l‘althybius had a shrine. and his

Although the concept of diplomatic
immunity was not fully developed in
ancient Greece. heralds were generally
treated with respect and courtesy. l‘he
code of hospitality applied to them
especially and even at times of war. the
violation of that code was a serious
matter. and doubly so in the case of
heralds.
