This column is being written for several
reasons. First. we do exist. Second. we
will not go away. Third. we want you to
understand where we are coming from. as
we would like to do with you. Up until
now. we have not been given the same
"suitemate rights" as our peers. For
example. if your boyfriend or girlfriend
comes to visit, as the case may be. we are
xpectcd to make ourselves scarce. Yet.

e seem not to be able to ask you for the
'ame courtesy.

Let us 'get to the crux of the matter.

he one thing that separates us from you
5 our choice of lifestyle. We are gay. We
re attracted to members ofthe same sex.
c know our straight friends have
'xpressed similar feelings» men for other
en. women for other women. Yet you
ttempt to squain those feelings. You are
at supposed to be feeling those things.
e are no different. Our love for our
' rtners is as deep and as full as yours.
e feel there should not be this societal

ai‘ Alliance.

limitation on having feelings for another
person ofthe same sex. and these feelings
need not only be sexual.

This column will attempt to inform the
entire community. and the gay

community on campus in particular. of 3

events. both local and national. dealing
with gay issues. There will. at times. be
articles that are editorial in nature. We
invite comments from our fellow
students. as well as faculty and staff.

At present, the following activity is in
the talking stage. One of our members is
meeting with Dean of Student Affairs.
Neil Brown. to discuss office space
possibilities onthe Draper campus for the
(iay Alliance. something we have been
fighting for for many years. We have.
until recently been restricted to bars and
small meeting groups. in an attempt by
society to keep us hidden. Moreover. the
peer pressure on campus against coming
out. i.e.. coming to terms with one‘s
sexuality. is so strong as to reduce the
number of gay men and lesbians that
attend the meetings ofthe (iay Alliance In
the Campus Center to a mere fraction of

what it could be. due to the proximity to

other peers. and the possible ostracism.

. This office will be located in an area for
enough'away from campus to allay these
fears. The office will also function asa gay
hotline to answer questions of a guy or
related nature. handle crisis calls. similar
to the function of Middle Earth on
campus. and give the'_gay community
information on events. '

This past Friday was National‘yGay
Blue Jeans Day. It Was (it)! an attempt to "

get people to come out. although several
people may have used this opportunityto
do so. It was an attempt at consciousness
raising. Those people who felt the needto
change their clothes for fear of possible
ostracism now know a little of what the
pressure is like. Those who wore blue
jeans and had their sexuality questioned
likewise felt the pinch. Those. however.
who were secure enough with themselves
not to change their clothes. probably see
our different lifester as no barrier at all.
and are our friends.

literary magazine called Community.
