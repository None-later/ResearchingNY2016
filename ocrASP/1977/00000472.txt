report

To the Editor:

The following is an excerpt from the
Monthly Report of Activity for April I977
written May Ill and directed to John
Hurtigan. Vice President for Business and
Finance from James Williams. Director ofthe
University Police. I am presenting this
evaluation of the Student Patrol to the
university community in hope of gaining
further support for funding of the program.

Nancy R. Joseph

The Student Patrol has been operational
throughout the month of April [I977]. in the
opinion of ofﬁcers and other members of the
Dcpartmcnt of Public Safcty. the expenditure
of funds on this program has bccn wcll worth
the cffort. Thc bcncfits of having upwards of
30 to 40 students closcly involved with thc
opcrations of thc dcpartrncnt arc ncccssuiily
subjective whcn it comes to bridging that
oftcn-cilcd hut rarcly dclincd gap bctwccn
st udcnts and mcmhcrs ofthc law cnforccmcnt
prolcssion. chcrthclcss. given the fact that
onc cannot cmpirically measure the value of
intcrpcrsonul relationships hclwccn officcrs
and studcnts involved in thc Studcnt Patrol. it
is not unreasonable to conclude that thcy arc
positive. rcmarkably so.

Morcovcr. Studcnt Patrol mcmbcrs luIvc
participatcd in scvcral efforts. both on their
own initiatch und in assist a rice of ofﬁcers. l‘or
cxuniplc: patrols have spotted and
discourade mischief by off campusjuvcnilcs.
both on thc uptown campus and on Alumni
Quad on scvcrnl occasions; they have been
first at tlIc sccnc of rcpurlcd medical
cmcrgcncics and I'cndcrcd aid until arrival of
thc 1‘ch Quad Amhulancc Corps; thcy havc
assistcd many lcllow students and visitors to
the campus by providing assistance ranging
from simplc rcqucsis for information to

assislancc In tllltt)|llg thc Icars ofsludcnts and
others asu result oi unfoundcd rumors rclativc

One of lhc major reasons thc l’utrol was
rcinslitutcd was to provide cscort services to
fcIIuilc studcuts through the unlit portions of
lllt.‘ campus. We had anticipated that there
would hc l'cw requests for escorts due to thc
limitcd nuturc of advertising of the program
and somc l'ccling on our part that females
would bc Icluctuni to usc thc service because
ol sonic nonspecific stigma. That assumption

was incorrcct. In the month of April alone. the J

patrol provided almost ‘10 cscorts.

SUNYA students. they set out to find an alternative to the minimal

services provided by Rosenblum and Levanthal —- despite all claims by ,

the ﬁrm that a better deal for the inoney didn't exist. V .
The Task Force found thalideal: and Rosenblurn and Levanthal.

evidently fearful of the loss of prestige that comes with being dropped

from‘the SUNYA account. not only matched that offer. but even
improved upon it. y '

‘ That. however. was the easy part of the Task Furce'a job. The
impressive part was the development of a progressive legal package.
hand-tailored to the speciﬁc needs of the students on this campus. The
retainer is to be divided between two legal representatives. Rosenblum

‘ and Levanthal and Jack Lester. It will provide for contact. advice.

education and litigation as well as action on behalf of students as a
group.
Most important. though. is the provision for continuous review.

Studcnt legal services is an area of constantly changing priorities. and

any program adopted by SA must be ﬂexible enough from yearto year
to rcponsibly handle these changes.
It looks like this year they've ﬁnally got one.

I I I
Cutting the Lifeline

Now that SA has ﬁnally fought its way to a tailor-made legal services
proposal, the administration is preparing to sign away a tailor-made
busing service; the green monsters.

It seems that as soon as C DTA agrees tothe addition of Zone One and
crosstown bus service for students. Vice President for Management and
Planning John Hartigan is ready and willing to ship the green buses of
to Stony Brook. '

But it‘s not simply the buses that Hartigan will be signing away. It's

also a bus system designed for and used by the students ofSUNYA; bus.

drivers who wait for students to get on; drivers who won’t stop packing
students on until every last one is out of the snow and one his way up-
town in a bus; drivers who will stay until 12: 10 whcnthey‘re schedulcsto
make that last run at 11:55; buses that will accomodate students who
have to travel late for special events like Telethon; and most important-
ly, buses that serve as a lifeline to the uptown campus forthc students of
this unique ly divided school.

Crosstown service does have its merits. but it is a luxury and luxuries
should not even be a topic of conversation until the question of basic
equivalent service is ironed out.

And that's the kind ofscrvicc that can only be reliably provided by our
own bus corps.
