NEW YORK (AP) ll Reggie
Jackson‘s crystal ball had forecast
the tumult and-tension oi' the I977
Yankees. he would have been wear-
ing Dodger lllue in the World Series.

“III had known what kind of year
it was goinglo be. I would have gone
to San Diego or |.os Angeles.
probably Los Angeles." said
Jackson Thursday. “Do vou thinkl
would have come here?“ I wouldn't
wish that on anybody.

“I never really talked to the
Dodgers. I didn‘t give them that
courtesy. I should have. llul Stein-
brenner was around all the lime and
put too much pressure on me."
Jackson was referring to George
Steinhrenner. tlte owner of the
Yankees whose super sellingjoh
and $2.9 million check ior live
years brought last year'slree-agcnt
pri/.c to New York.

Steinbrenner’s reward for signing
Jackson and supporting him
through his season-long crises was
that he now owns the best learn in
baseball. courtesy ol'Jaekson and his
teammates‘ six-game victory over
the Dodgers.

Jackson's iewards are more than
vicarious.

‘Thoughtson-Spong  :' -» 7 . 

. by Eddie l-l ' ._

With the I977 World Series now history. you ciiiEa ain t‘
attention to Albany State sports. & ow“ your

For those of you who were only concerned about whet her Billy Martin"
tcuding Yankees would beat 'l'ommy llasorda’s Dodger family. it might com:
as a surprise to you thiit the Albany Siatc tennis and baseball team ended
their season! last week.

And they did so oit disappointing notes.

The batters appropriately ended a frustrating season by droppin a
doubleheader to Binghamton. They finished with l4 losses and only ingree
winsxlt was by litr'c'oaeh Bob Burtingame‘s worst season.

t Astor the nettcrtt. well. they finished by losing to :1 Coast Guard team that
Sunday hackers could have beaten.

The netters‘ Season was to say the least. disappointing. True. theydid have
a 3-2 record. but with the talent they possess the team should have been
undeleatcd. as they were last fall.

Injuries plagued the team throughout llte year forcing them to have a
ditlerent lineup iii all the matches. The only player who knew everyday what
position he would be playing was I’attl Feldman, the best player in the
SUNYAC the past three years.

But the nctlci's can‘t iise injuries as an excuse lor their season. they can
blame themselves.

there were problems with the tltlllttdcs of some ot‘ tltc players. and this
didn‘t please llob Lewis. the tennis coach. “I has really disappointed in the
attitudes ol some of the players towards the end at theseason,"said Lewis.

“In the beginning ol'thc season I thought We would he undcl'catcd." said
the Albany coach. “1 here is no reason we should have lost the two matches
we did."

“Overall it was a disappointing season." coiicltidcd Lewis.

Itut only hall the season is over. the spring season will provide for better
competition tor the Danes.

However. it they had troubleagainst weakci'tcams in the tall. how can they
play teams lrom Division I.

II the team cait iron otit their porblcins. they‘ll do well. Lewis was
encouraged by the surprising play in the SIINYAC‘s. 'I'heyt'inished second in
a tourney that only l‘cldniaii was a sure bet.

But if the players. as Lewis says. are not loyal or committed to the team.

 

the Danes couid be in trouble in the spring.
