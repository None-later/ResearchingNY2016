Olicitsivcly. the Cadets and Danes

Lance. former Budget Director

CDTA Issues Still Unresolved

by Todd Davis
and Mike l'earlntan

Vice President of Business attd

would sign the current CDTA bus
contract if CDTA accepted it in its
entirety at a conference between Stu-
dent Unioniration representatives
and Hartigtiit on Friday.

Hartigan said that a key poiitt iii
the revised eotttract is a clause
providing students with free service
within a five mile radius of the
Wellington Hotel (Zone one) which
would opctt tip a "whole new hous-
ing scene“ for students.

SUM spokesittan Bruce Cronin
said “We won't accept Zone one at
the expense of other services. Zone -
one won‘t resolve the issues of over-
crowding. bus drivers. loss of cott-
trol. and the inconvenience to the
community. Furthermore. Zone one
provides no furtlter Westerit Ave.

such as eotnmuttity-studcnt coin-
pelitiott for seats and loss ofcoiitrol
over the bus service cauttot he iti-
clttded in any contract. regat'dlcs of
how good the contract is otherwise.

Hartigatt agreed lliat control was
a major issue.

A heated discussion arose between
SUM oll'icials and llartigau oti their
respective interpretattons of the
issue.

world" situation dictates that he
must weigh all the benefits ol the

and to tltc state.

SUM spokesman said they felt
that a signed contract dictates titling

CDTA buses for a lengthy period
even if the service is itot satisfactory
because the SUNY buses would be
sold to SUNY at Stoitybrook.

CD’l A officials and the SUNYA
Bus Cotntnittce will meet on l‘hurs-
day to discuss the eurrettt contract.

because the uniott is subject to the

CDTA Public Relations Director
Keith Bai'bersaid that the employees
are working on art extension of the
old contract.

  

"This is not the first time we've
ltad negotiations and there‘s no real
cause for concern. We have a very
reasonable ttnion attd they are
currently involved in negotiations.“

Hartigait said "Something might
come up with anyone's contract. I
don‘t see how it would affect us. It‘s

Hartigan said he "didn‘t really
