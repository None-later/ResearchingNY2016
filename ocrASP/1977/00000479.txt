Moscow.

The McDonald's Restaurant

chain is reportedly making a strong
bid to bring its fast food'serviec to
the Soviet Union by the l980‘s. ,

McDonald‘s of Canada is said to
be holding some high level dis-
cussions with Soviet Ofﬁcials about
burgers and french fries. and howthe
russians might be able to feed the
250.000 visitors they are expecting
for the 1980 Olympics.

Ronald McDonald has yet to pack
his suitcase for Moscow. however.
The soviets have advised the burger
barons that they are also listening to
bids from a Yugoslav fast food chain
to help feed hungry olympic fans.

INCREASED RISK

The Environmental Protection
Agency has given the go-ahead for a
controversial army plan to fly 900
deadly nerve gas bombs from
Denver over populated areas to the
Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.

The nerve gas bombs. which were
reportedly designed to trigger
repiratory failure and sudden death.
are currently stored at the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal in Denver. The
Army. however. wants to move the
toxic nerve gas to the isolated
Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.

In Denver. in a letter to the army.
says that the agency has "no remain-
ing environmental reservations“

about ﬂyingthe nerve-gas. The agen-
cy conceded. bewevcrythat there is
what it called a “definite societal
risk" associated with keeping the
weapons at the Rocky Mountain

Arsenal. and that ﬂying the toxic.'

materials did. of course. increase
that risk.

I The army says that the nerve gas
should probably be moved because it
is next to Denver‘s busy Inter-
national Airport. wherc an acciden-
tal plane crash might cause a major
nerve gas catastrophe in Denver.

NEVER AGAIN

The small community of Bethel.
New York. was the site of the
Woodstock festival eight years ago.
and community leaders are making
sure that nothing like that ever
happens in Bethel again.

Just last week. a rock promoter
named John Byeowski met with the
Bethe! town board in auction to put
together a gala rock rcstival next spr-
ing to be called "Woodstock 78."

Bycowski indicated he had plans
to broadcast the event nationwide
over closed-circuit television. and
even offered a monetarty incentive
to the community. He is reported to
have offered the township itself $50.-
000. plus another $700,000 to be
divided among Hethei's residents.

How did the idea of a “Woodstock
78" go over‘.’ Bethel Town Super-

MORE INTRIGUE

A former worker at the Kerr
McGee 'nuclear facility in
Oklahoma claims he was told by
another employee the Kerr-McGee
ofﬁcials were attempting to steal
weapons-grade uranium from the
US government.

Jim Smith. a former supervisor at
the Kerr-McGee plant in Crescent.
Oklahoma. says he learned of the
alleged plot from a co-worker be
identiﬁed as Gerald Cooper.

Smith. in a sworn afﬁdavit taken
in Oklahoma City last week. said
Cooper told him on two different oc—
casions that he was asked by Kerr-
McGee executives to help divert
high-grade uranium from govern-
ment stockpiles. -

According to Smith's affidavit.
Cooper had been asked to par-
ticipate in the alleged diversion
scheme by a Kerr-McGee manage-
ment official identified as “Robert
Klause.“ Smith quotes Cooper as
saying that he turned the request
down both times. and “was never
asked again.“

This startling testimony is sur-
facing in the midst of an investiga-
tion into the mysterious death of
Karen Silkwood. a plant worker
who was killed in a car crash nearly
three years ago. ‘

At.the time of her death. Silkwood
was reportedly carrying internal
Kerr-McGee documents in her car
relating to the lax safety precautions-

Government investigators have

plutonium. enough to produce
several atomic weapons. was missing
or unaccounted fer at the Kerr-
McGee plant about the time of

" lSilkwood‘s deaths

Kerr-McGee has insisted the
material was inadvertently poured
down drain pipes. However. former

supervisor Smith. in an earlier intcr- '

view with Rolling Stone Magazine.
said he personally checked those
pipes and could not‘find any trace of
the missing nuclear materials.

Interest in the phenomenon.
known as “pyramid power“ has now;

The New York-based record:

East and West coasts. has revealed
plans to construct a new recording;

pyramids. 
The new complex will be built on at

beginning early next year. Record.
plant officials say that each of the’
pyramids will be identical in shape to
the great pyramid at Gireh in Egypt.

Record plant engineers claim that,

for a recording studio since each wall
in a studio must slant at a different
angle from the opposite wall.

The first pyramid to be built will
house three smaller but identically-

These studios will reportedly rely on
