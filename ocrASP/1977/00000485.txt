Haliston’s 99- Yard 112 Sparks Offenses

Defense Shuts Off Nation’s Top Rasher

by Ron I-‘ontanettii

The Albany State Varsity Foot-
ball team. sparked by rrinning back
Sam Haliston's 99-yard touchdown
run. scored an impressive 2l-7 vic—
tory over the Norwich Cadets Satur-
day afternoon at University Field.

The win was the fifth straight for
the Danes. their longest winning
streak since they went undefeated in
I974.

Haliston netted lti4 yards on to
carries. In contrast. Norwich run-
ning back Milt Willing was held to
a season low 5| ﬁtraon l'lcrtrries by
the pursuing Albany defense. which
forced him to the inside most of the
game. Williams had entered the
game as the nation's leading riislier
and scorer in Division III with a I45-
yard average per game.

Albany head coach Robert l‘ill‘tl
said it took a “total defensive effort

to keep him [Williams] inside us.“
He stressed the importance of no
offensive turnovers in Albany‘s own
territory in order to give the defense
good field position to work from.
“Each trait is dependent on the
other.“ said Ford.

Both teams unsuccessfully tried to
move the ball on the ground early in

the game. but on their second
possession. Norwich came out
throwing.

(‘adet quarterback Mike Palmer
drove his team to the Albany nirie-
yard line by completing three con-
secutive passes. including one for 29
yards to his big tight end l’aul

With the victory recorded as three

the Danes ttotelted the third.

It has beerithe distinguishing trait
of the I977 Danes for sortie of their

"They plugged up the holes which
