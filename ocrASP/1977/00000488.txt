in response to the report last year
of the Special Committee to Review
the Undergraduate Experience; the
academic colleges at SUNYA have
begun a process of internal evalua-
tion. ' »

The evaluations are examiningthe
nature. focus and direction of both
glitter rapuate‘ and graduate
{curricul "Also being reviewed are
the priorities upon which resources
are allocated within each of the
colleges. N

The SC R U E report recommended
that all SUNYA undergraduates be
required to take a minimum of nine
credits in each of the two colleges
outside their major."l‘his recommen-
dation. as well as the possibility of
modifying course offerings within
departments. is being weighed
within each college.

“There is much to he realized by
sitting back and taking a look at
ourselves." Dean of the College of
Humanities and Fine Arts John
Shumaker said.

Activities within the Humanities
college have so far been conﬁned to
the planning stag '. Shumakcr said.

“Many discussionspf high pn‘o

ty are taking place about ways and 

means of strengthening programs
and providing 'resources. to
students.“ Cowling said. ,

Shumaker. who came to SUNYA.
in the summer of I977, has many
ideas on just how academic matters
may be improved. Instead of offer-
ing majors only in traditional fields,
'Shumalter said. he feels it may be
beneﬁcial to offer concentrations in
areas which transcend traditional
disciplines. Sbumaker suggested
“focusing on issues laterally. such as
Democracy or Law and Justice."

He said he is also concerned that
the colleges should be “more respon-
sive to the needs of non-majors. We
should offer a broadening quality of
education to students regardless of
major." he said.

The question of where priorities
lie in allocating funds between un-
dergraduate and graduate programs
is considered by most a controversial
issue. ‘

knowledge that makes up Science.
there may' be a necessary emphasis
on research in this area. ,

“Yes. you better have a lot of
research and scholarship." he said.
“This. at least. will ensure students of
knowledge (through their
professors) on the very current. cut-
ting edge of the ﬁeld.“ He added.
“the fellow in the lab is the one who
can properly ansWer students‘ '
questions, and he can do so with the
enthusiasm that can only be
transmitted through a person direct-
ly involved with the frontiers of
knowledge.“

leaving will affect the functioning of
his office. Poland said that
“. . . with fewer hands. we can do
less.“ But he said he intends to
reorganize his ofﬁce “. . . to take
uptheslack. . . we won'tbecaught
by surprise on January l8."

Poland said that he had ordered a
management study done to help
determine the best way to go about
reorganizing the Dean‘s ofﬁce.

The committee of Graduate
School of Public Affairs students
that intiaily attempted to ﬁnd out
why Baron‘s contract was not renew-
ed have been active in other ways. and
ltave attempted to set up a letter
writing campaign to show support
for Baronc. whiehthey hope may be
instrumental in overturningthe non-
renewal decision.

According to Assistant to the

President J. Fredericks Volkwein.
from six to a dozen letters have been
received hy‘the Ofﬁce of the Presi-
dent concerning Mr. itarone. These
letters are  . . mostly supportive
if the past performance of Sandro
Barone. Some are from individual
grad students and others are front
people who have found jobs in
various state agencies with the help
of Mr. ilaronc." he said.

Asked if these letters and the
general show of student and faculty
support would have arty affecton tltc
status of Baronc‘s contract.
Volkwein said: "The decision to
reconsider Mr. Baronc for contract
renewal would not originate in this
ofﬁce. That would be up to the new
Dean of the School and the Vice
President for Academic Affairs.
although the President would have
to make the final decision."
