THERE‘S A CATCH

Nomura Securities in Tokyo has
made an interesting study of the
relationship between women and
proﬁts in Japan. I

The company researched
Japanese stock companies and
found that Japan's most profitable
firms are the ones which employ an
above-average number of women.

Twenty-five highly-profitable.

companies enjoy at least 40 per cent
women. the study found. while the
48 companies at the bottom of the
Tokyo stock market employ a mere
i7 per cent women.

According to Parade magaline,
Nomura’s explanation for this
phenomenon is rather simple: the
research ﬁrm says Japanese women
are paid about 40 per cent less than
Japanses nien. and thus it's easy to
make proﬁts by payinglower wages.

SEXISM OUT

Oregon‘s State Textbook Com-
mission has voted to take the sexism
out of tire “founding fathers.“

The Commission has recommend~
cd that social studies textbooks
which refer to the“l ounding l‘at hers"
will no longer be acceptable for use
in Oregon's schools because the
phrase is sexist.

The Commission has also

  
  
  
  

recommended that the‘ Oregon

Board of Education not distributeto
public schools any books containing
such phrases as“ Red China."“scien-
lists are men who.“ and “dark conti-
nent." Textbooks that always pic-
ture girls as housewives or
secretaries. or boys as police officers
or mechanics are also not acceptable
for public schools, the Commission
rules.

GOT'CHA

For people who. prefer movie
theaters over television because of
the absence of commercials in
theaters. Screenvision has some bad
news.

The company has arranged for
three-minute commercials to being
screening in 3000 movie theaters
across the U.S. starting next week.

Sereenvision says it surveyed eight
theater markets and found that peo-
ple won‘t stay away from movies
simply because commercials are
shown.

The company admitted. however.
that it didn‘t ask movie goers
whether they liked advertising dur-

UNDER PRESSURE

U.S. Attorney General Grifﬁn
Bell says he has been under intense
pressure from high-level members of
the Washington, DC establishment
not to allow former CIA director
Richard Helms to be indicted on per-
jury charges.

Bell. in an interview with 77m Los-
Angeles Times. says that leading
republicans and democrats. veteran
senators and even major news media
ﬁgures have been cornering him at
cocktail parties and other social
gatherings, urging him not to
prosecute Helms. I

The Carter administraiion is
currently debating whether to
prosecute Helms for allegedly lying
to senators three years ago when he
denied arty CIA involvement irt ef-
l‘ons to overthrow Salvador Allende

 

 
 

in Chile.

Bell says that veteran senators ;
T have been taking him asides telling
7. him his possible prosecution of

Helms indicates that Dell does not
“understand the .system.” CBS

:newsmun Eric Sevareid. according
.to The 77mm. told Bell it would be a
"‘shamc“ if Helms was prosecuted.

The Helms prosecution. ifit takes

‘ place. could be a big one. It has been

reported that Helms may possess
documents indicating Henry
Kissinger personally instructed him
to mislead the senate when Helms
was questioned about Chile.

Well. if Presley‘s former manager
Colonel Torn Parker has his way.
Nelson will be the next superstar.

ing of advertisements on two or
more stations at the identical time.

LASER BEERS

If you’ve ever wondered who
makes all the weapons that the U.S.
sells abroad: at Philadelphia research
grorrp may have a few answers for
you.

Narmic. a research arm of the
American Friends Service Cont-
mittec. has published a handly little
pocket guide called A Directory of
Munitions Makers. 'l'hc llooklet lists
more than i000 weapons manufac~
turers by state. and gives their head-
quarters' address. subsidiaries. of-
ficers. parent or holding companies.
and the kinds of war materials they
produce.

For instance. the Xerox Corpora-
tion. the company which helps us
reproduce memos. also makes night
viewers which Were used in Vietnam
and laser weapons. The liulove
Watch Company uses its well-
known timing and precision t:qu-
tise to make fuses and ammunition
manufacturing machines; the Corr-
tincntal Can Company not only dis-
tributes six-packs and l-V dinners.
but it makes ammunition boxes as
well.

()ther weapons companies. Nar-
mic says. are such unlikely names as
the National Cash Register ('om-
pan). Magnovok. Corning (ilass
Wot ks. lzaslman Kodak and the
Rerer Copper and Brass ('ompnny.
