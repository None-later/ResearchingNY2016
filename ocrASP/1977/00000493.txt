professor Lawrence Plotkin says these
coefﬁcients are "very low. in fact almost
meaningless!"

To compound problems, the ETS. despite
Testing Services Director Carol Kovaes'
assertion that the ETS is virtually infallible.
has made a considerable amount of errors. In
addition to losing transcripts for 200 law
school applicants from SU NY Albany. ETS
has been accused of incorrect score reports.
incorrect scheduling. late reporting of test
scores, and other mechanical errors.

Other criticism regarding the ETS have
centered around its tests‘ racial and cultural
bias. Responding to striking statistics that
showed significant differences between the
{Cores of wealthy Anglo-Saxons and poor
non-whites. ETS Vice-president Robert
Solomon refused to make public such data
because "it would be misinterpreted.“ E'l'S‘
tests look for values and acquired skills

consistent with mainstream society and not
for aptitude. This statement is substantiated
by a consultant at the Federal Ofﬁce of
Education. “They‘re [ETS] norm-setters.
After all. who are those 58 people who write
the tests? All mainstream people."
According to the eminent author of
Tyranny of Testing. Bunesh Hoffman.
“Multiple choice tests penalize the deep
student. dampen creativity. foster intellectual
dishonesty. and undermine the very
foundations of education." ETS shapes
decisions which are fartooimportant tobeleft '
unregulated. The testing industry exists in a
vacuum. It should be scrutinczed like any
other industry. However students. who arethc
captive consumers. must take the tests
regardless oftheir opinion oflhe services. But
students should have a say in what they buy.
On Monday. Oct. 31 and Tuesday through
Thursday. Nov. l-3. NYl‘lRG will be
conducting a survey of SUNY Albany
