ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

OCTOBER '28. 1977

in an act which serves to distort the facts.
An organization such as the Student
Unionization Movement. which currently has
a membership of over three hundred students
cannot prevent individuals whosupport us(or
those who oppose us) from misrepresenting
our intentions to a press which is lax in
checking its sources. Any check with a
member of the issues committee of the Student
Unionization Movement would have revealed
that the individual in question, was engaged in
misrepresentation of our position. To
attribute this act. as Mr. Roscnthal did. as a
deliberate attempt by SUM to misinform the
public is' a disservice in the hundreds of

dedicated members of our organization who

would never condone such an act.

community
interest

To the Editor:

As it former SUNYA student now li\ing
and working in the Albany community. I
have been watching with interest the
arguments for and against the (‘l)'l‘A
takeover. Some ofthe discussion against the
takeover has omitted serious concerns. while
other points against CD'I'A have included
disionion ol facts. As a ('l)'l A communter.
I would like to try and set the record slraiglil.

Firstly. students have argued that during
the "rush hour". buses would be
overcrowded. What rush hour are you
talking about? By far. the majority of
workers make a mass exodus for dormant-n
Albany between the hours of 7:30 and 9:00
am. The only major group of people
heading uptown are lhose that work at lhc
Slap: Office Campus. l'Iiey utlIl/c ihe
nlimhcr l2 Washington Ave-Campus buses.
and must be at work by N am. You would
most likely not be at all affected by this: Ilic
rush hour for SUNYA is uptown. In the
afternoons. the workers" will be heading
uptown: you will be heading dtl\\'lllti\\'ll.
Why the panic‘.’

Secondly. there has been a fuss about
checking IDs. All the plihlic aild parochial
students ulili/c (‘|)l/\. llicy incrcly‘ llash
their passes at the driver. who i hcii lcls lliciii
through. It takes much more time Ior paying
passengers to deposit their lai'c. request and
obtain transfers. and wait for the dri\cr to
check that the fare is correct. Also. once the
contract has been awarded to ('l) M. they
will not be overly concerned that those
SUNYA sludciils using their lll‘s are using
valid ones. llicy only care about the
awarding oi the conlracl and Ihc lands that
go along with it.

I mentioned serious concerns that I Iccl
Ilil\’t: been omitted. iii the arguments againsl
CD'I A, Consider tllc existing cri nic problem
on campus. a problem largely caused by the
Albany community. Many ol'lhc angels Ilial

rip off
rebuff

To the Editor:

I‘d been diligently studying in the librarv.
when I suddenly had the urge totakc awalk
to the men‘s room. Upon my returingto my
CH."'10‘*0m-: again - resume my .evening‘s
activities. I was startled to find that my Levi
corduroy jacket had been permanently
borrowed.

The following is directed to one of my
colleagues who is presently enjoying the
beneﬁts ofmyjacket. llowthe hell could you
possible steal a jacket from someone in a
library? Where is your sense ofintcgrily.’ Not
only was thisjackct taken. but you probably
are not aware of the psychological damage
you have caused me. Wilholll the warmth
and snugncss of the jacket. I am left with
fond memories and a lasting impression of
how things used to be. fire past was ﬁlled
with joy and happincs of life with myjiicket.
'I’hat life does not exist anymore. It has now
been replaced by a life of misery. drcarincss.
depression. anti sexual inadequacies.

ll lhc picture I have just described is
beyond your scope of understanding. please
allow me to express myself in such
terminology that perhaps will be more
comprcllcndablc and leave more of a lasting
impression on you. Apparently. you are a
rat-bastard. descn liig the image of a lowlife.
You possess no clear eullscicncc. morals. tll'
kindness. I can only hope you are treating
you new claim with some affection mid
tenderness. althouin I sincerely doubt you
are capable of it.

This entire incident may all appear to be
quite humorous. but the fact remains I am an
extremely paranoid individual. who is
constanily having to look over his shoulder
for his long lost jacket. I have turned to
religion. as a result. to case my \yocs.
Someday. I hope you experience the agony
you have inflicted upon me. you rat-bastard.
scum ol the earth! If you had incrcly
requested llic jacket because of a lack of
lands. I would have labeled you a cheap
screw. However. you didn‘t even blue the
decency to ask! l’licrcl'orc. because of your
lack oi compassion towards one of your
cronies. not only am I going to lablc youas It

Looking For The Union Label

It's interesting that the Student Unionization Movement is refusing

responsibility for its own members.

Earlier this week, WCDB General Manager Paul Rosenthal

complained of a SU M member impersonating a WCDB news man. In a
reply. two SUM “strategy committee” members have disassociated the
organization from the actions of this misguided member of their ﬂock by
saying. in essence. that an organization of such great size cannot be
expected to keep tabs on each and every member.

Which is clearly ridiculous. If a group of people get together and act as
o lilngle entity. even going so far as to call themselves a movement, then
each member is a representative of the whole. And the movement as a
whole is responsible for any action taken in its name.

This is only one of the more recent manifestations of SUM’s overall
tactical misdirection. Perhaps their greatest failing has been to forget
that SUM is a movement to unionize students —— not a student union.
SUM should inform and recruit. When it comes time to choose issues.
that's up to the union in a democratic vote by its members.

SUM. however —— or Dave Gold. or a strategy committee —— has
decided to take on the CD'I‘A issue. Admittedlythis is probably the most
clcarcut issue they could have chosen in terms of students support. but
that‘s no justification. It was chosen to maximize publicity about
unionization: it was chosen to maximize interest in membership in a
union; it was chosen to firmly establish the movement as a political force
on this 'ampus.

All lhcs ‘ are valid reasons for astudcnt union. but there is no union at
SUNYA yct. 'l‘hcrc is only a unionization movement. and all it has
accomplished is to pack its ranks with downtown students dependent
on the buses. alienate most administrators and mercilessly personally
persecute Vice President John Hartigan.

As SA President. Dave Gold is of course primarily responsible forthc
needs of the student body. And unionization is high on the list of
priorities for students.

But what (iold has to realize is that as much as students need aslrong
lobbying force they can back up in sheer numbers. they also need an
organization to be able to deal calmly and rationally with the
university bur ‘alicracy.

Right now. they have neither.
