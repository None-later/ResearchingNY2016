If you‘re a member of the off campus
student community. there are quite a few
people out there who tire trying - with
varying degress of success to rip you off.
The only way to deal effectively with these
people in many cases is through deliberate
group action. and the recent Country Squire
uproar serves as it good example of this fact.

It all started last summer when the
University. pressed for dormitory space.

contracted with the owners of the Country'

Squire Motel in (iuildcrland to provide
housing for Si students. The students who
eventually opted to live at the motel. most of
whom are new to this school. did so with the
very reasonable understanding that the terms
at the contract they signed Would be lived up
to. The contract listcdn speciticsericsol'tcrms
and conditions to be met by both the motel
management and the student tenants. It‘s
accompanying cover sheet described the
facilities and services on the (‘ountry Squire‘s
“three and a half quiet. sprawling acres“ in the
most appealing terms. and the contract itscll
listed a specific set of terms and conditions
under which the nioth management and the
student tcnants would li\c iii harmonious
coexistence. l’ivc wccks Iatcr. following a
series of unhccded complaints and tunnel
obligations on the Squtrc iiiaiiagciiiciu‘s part.
the students living at the motel lolltid
themselves very disappointed. personally
inconvenienced. and seemingly llclplt‘ss to
deal cll'cctivcly with the management

It began to occur to many ol the Country
Squire residents at this point that rather
than attempting to rcsohc liidl\ldlilll
problems on an indiiidual basis their best
option \Hlllltl he to organi/c thcmsclics
around common concerns. and worked as a
unilicd. \Itihlt.‘ group. Working on the basis of
this group approach. rcpicsctitativcs of thc
Suture tenants. aided by the ()II (‘ainpiis
Assoctation. that tip a specific and

GrouprAction vs. Rip offs;

comprehensive petition which was
subsequently signed by 4i of the Si motel
residents. The petition. dated Oct. 3.
addressed itself to the numerous problems
that had come tip in the previous weeks. and
wcnl on to advise that the management “take
the necessary action to remedy this situation

by complying with the contracted

agreements." Finally. the petition demanded
the establishment of a committee. composed
of five student tenants from the motel. three
representatives of the Off Campus
Association. John Welly. SUNYA Director of
Residences. and Karlccn Karlson of the Off
Campus Housing Office. This committee met
for the lust time on Tuesday. Oct. Ill. and the
parties involved reviewed the students“

Abolishing

One hundred fifty years ago. on .luly4. l827,
New York passed the law that officially
abolished slavery within the State. Not until
H463 was the National lzmancipation
Proclamation declared. Nc\\ York State. then.
led the nation by thirty~six years iii the
abolition ol slavery.

lhe Scsqiuccntciiiiial ('clcbriition will
commemorate the precedent set by New York
as a leader iii the moieiiient for human
equality and multi-racinl harmony soitglit
throughout the ltlsltit‘) of our country. it will
also provide the occasion tor realfirming the
commitment made by State Icadcrs iii |827.
the ultimate goal ol the event is to make the
celebration an atmospheric catalyst for
rcstoring belief in the reality of freedom.

proposed remedies to the problems they had
encountered. The Squire management.
initially hesitant to agree to the student
tenants proposals at this meeting, became
more receptive bythc time a follow up meeting
was held on Friday. Oct. 2|. Faced withu well
organized group of people with common
interests and legitimate grievances. the
management finally agreed to virtually all of
their tenunts' substantive demands. and to
reaffirm and clarify the terms of the original
contract.

The Country Squire affair is not yet over.
The motel residents remain as an organized
force and are working with the management
toward the resolution of remaining problems.
And. as their petition implied. the students are

The really important thing about this whole

and workable settlement for the Country

that organization can be an ctlectivc. vital tool

The Off Campus Association is aiming for
organization on it large scale. because we can
