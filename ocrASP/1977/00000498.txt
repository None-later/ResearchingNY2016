“l thought after beating Norwich Saturday we would move

game as the seventh-ranked team in the Lambert Bowl.

“It's a disappointment." Ford said. “ But we have absolutely no
control over the voting. We can't let it bother us. Wejust have to
ctuttrrttic to go otit and play football.“

What‘s important about the Lambert rankings is the top two

After the tying goal. Alberto
Girodano was reinserted irtto the
Albany goal. Settiet‘l'elin stated.
“Dario was it bit nervous. so I took
him out ofthe net.“

The Danes recovered their poise
after the St. Francis goal. and renew-
ed their attack.

Alex l’ttgano broke in all alone on
the St. Francis goalkeeper. only to
have his shot sail overthe net. Carlos
Arango had a near breakaway. hilt
his shot also went over tlre ttet.

Another great scoring opportuni-
ty was stifled by the smart play of a
St. Francis dcfenscmait. Witlr the
goalie dowit oil the ground after
making saves off the foot of (iage
and Arango. the deleitseiiiait
gathered the brill under his legs. git-
itrg the goalie time to reposition

Alter one goztf was nullified due to
an irllsides. the defense couldn't
