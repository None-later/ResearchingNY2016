Utility industry experts share the
Brown Administration's confidence
that the new law will result in an im-
mediate demand for'solar systems.

“Incentives are necessary to carry
the public over its initial reliictanee.“
says Dr. John Cummings. director
of solar operations for the industry-
sponsorcd Electrical Power and

Research Institute in Palo Alto..

“The current cost of solar installa-
tion has proven to he higherthanthe
market will accept. Government's
sharing of that cost is necessary to
gain widespread acceptance.“

The actual expense of installing
home solar systems is still open to
debate. however. So far. costs haVe
ranged widely. .

’I he Pacific (ins and Electric Co.
recently spent Sl3.000 to equiptt test
house in Hart .lose with solar
tacililies. And ILS. Department of
Energy official Don Riordan says it
should cost between 86.000 and $8.-
000 for home installation.

but at least one developer has
been able to install solar power for
muclt less. Mik'c Corbett found that
in his projected 250 home communi-
ty ncar |)a\ is Ill tiortliern California.
he cotild provide air "active" solar

system complete with pump and

A "passive" solar system that
doesn't use pumps coitld beinstallcd

solar system that oiin provides hot

Brown Administration has'bcgun
encouraging some industries to shift
to solar pchr. Cannerieri and food
processers are prime targets. and
state officials will soon'mect with
representatives from Del Monte and
Campbell Soup.

The governor‘s Office of Ap-
propriate 'l‘echnology says the state
can assure f tiod processors that solar
systems will pay off their entire cost
within five years.

Meanwhile. industry will be close-
ly watching the experimental
application of solar power to
Fresno‘s Red Star Laundry. whose
test system was dedicated by lirown
ltist month. The laundry hopes the
solar system will enable it to cut its
natural gas needs in half.

The Red Star installation cost

notes Richard \inullin. chairman of
the California Energy Research and
Development Commission. it is the
largest commercial application of
solar energy yet attempted iii the

' “and we expect it to
propagate a lot of others."

To symholi/c its commitment to
solar energy. the lirown Administra-
tion recently announced plans to
build a new multi-million dollar
state ol'lice complex near the capitol
in Sacramento that will use solar
energy as its prime heating source.
The same system is also designed to
cool the btiildiiig during Sacramen-
to's stifling hot summers.

The complex was designed by
Henham-lilair & Affiliates. one of
the largest architectural and
engineering lirmsiti the nation. State
Architect Sim Vun dcr Ryn calls the
design "an extremely bold and
significant concept that will make
Sacramento the nation's solar show-
case.“

The SUNY’ Board of Trustees
resolution which suspended classes
on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur
has met with opposition on many
SUNY campuses.

The decision. which was made at
the Trustees meeting of .lune 22.
negated a calendar drawn up for
SUNYA which did not include
suspension of classes on holy days.
The calendar was drawn up by the
Educational Policies Committee and
would have gone into effect next
year.

new Focus

A.. . ant to the President .I.
l'rcdcricks Volkwciii said that there
are several problems iitltcrctit in the
lriistces‘ decision. Volkwcin said
that the dcctsioii applies iii-
discriminaicly to all SUNY schools
regardless to the We of .Iewish
enrollment In each school. that it
singles out certain holy days and not
others such as Passover uitd that it is
tinspccilic in regards to evening
nights bciorc Rush
llashzinah and Your Kipput.

Volkiyciit said that another
problem brought tip by the decision
Is lhc rights ol other religions to have
classes suspended iitt their hon days.

According to the l'l’t' calendar
rcccoiiiendations made last spring.
“our status as a state institution
mandates a more neutral policy oii
thosc religious days which are not
state holidays. Ilicre is almost no
end to the number of days which
could be observed by one religion or
another.“

A Jewish Students ('oalrtion
member said that Rosh Ilasbanah
and Yorn Krppiu'. being the holiest
oi Jewish holidays. decree that Jews
itot work or go to school.

"It the teacher goes ahead with
classes. 90 per cctit ol the Jewish
students on this Ctlllllills will miss the
Work.“ tltc member said.

Ilie l‘l'(' has formed an ad litic
calendar committee consisting of

 

 

 

 

classes Ilic

.two students.‘faéiiliy members and

administrators. to examine the
calendar policy rind surrounding
issues.

According to JSC President Lisa

‘Wesley, no members of JSC or any

other religious groups will be on the
committee. She added that JSC will
be consulted by the committee oti
needs and wants of Jewish students:

At other SUNY campuses. the
decision has caused problems. SUC
at Geneso President Robert MacVit-
tic called the decision an unnecessary
action because the SUNY guidelines
for calendar dcvelopmctit cover the
problem of religious holidays Well
enough.

The guidelines state. “On those
religious holy days when members of
a faith typically observe the expecta-
tioit oi church or synagogue that
they be absent from school or work.
campuses will avoid scheduling of
such events as registration. the first
day ol classes or siudciit coit-
iocations. and individual students
will be excused lroin class without
pcrtalty as expressly requested."

l\o l’rohlems

MacVittic said that in the past
(iencsco has had no problems with
laculty or students oit this issue aitd
that this year's academic calcttdar
had to be changed because it was
drawn up prior to the trustees deci-
hIlIII.

ecutive Assistant to the President

now not a realistic possibility. The

SUNY at Stony Brook Assistant
to the President Sally Fltthcny said
their calendar was developed with
the help of a long consultation with
