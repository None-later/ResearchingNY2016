CLEAN FINGER

A Connecticut Superior Court has
ruled that the notorious “digitus im-
pudicus" is not obscene.

The “digitus impudictar.“ in case
you‘re wondering. is the legal deﬁni-
tion for that one-finger gesture.
more commonly known as “the
finger“ or the "the bird.“

The Hartford Court ruled that
obscenity charges must be dropped
against tl high school student who
had employed the gesture insttluting
a Connecticut Highway Patrol of-
ﬁcer.

According to the court. the
gesture would be obscene if it was
“likely to arouse sexual desire. The
more likely response." the court
stated. “is anger."

SUPER SWEET

A Texas A&M professor says
that the answer to the artiﬁcial
sweetener crisis may befound in. of
all places. grapefruit skins.

Dr. Calvin‘Lyons of the Univer-
sity‘s Agricultural Extension Service
says that the same chemical that
gives grapefruit its early season
bitterness can be easily converted
into a powerful sweetener. He says
the chemical is cttllcd “naringin.”
and that after a simple conversion
process. it becomes a super
sweetener with a strength |S00 times
that of sugar.

According to Dr. Lyons. the new
sweetener could be produced at the
mere cost of $40 per ton. All that is
needed now. Lyons says. is govern-
ment tests arid Food and Drug Ad-
ministration approval.

ACTIVE “A’s”

Here‘s a new one: A I’ucrto Rican
sociologist is claiming that students
might be able to improve their
grades in college simply by engaging
regularly in sex.

Martin Segrera ot' the University
of I’uerto Rico says that a study of
l000 students indicates‘lhttl regular
sexual activity has a positive effect
on grade-point averages.

'l‘he sociologist says he discovered
that married students. along with
single ones. who reported engaging
in sexual intercourse frequently
showed tip with tnarks almost 20
percent higher than their fellow
students.

Segrera reports that both males

SICK CARE

Police in Dearborn. Michigan.
have begun an intensive searchfor“a
man dressed in green medical
clothing" following reports that the
man may have been administering
unauthorized injections to patients
at a local hospital.

Hospital administrators at the
Oakwood Hospital in Dcarborn say
the incident is bizarrely similarto the
circumstances surrounding the I975
poisonings of more than 50 patients
at the Veterans Hospital in Ann Ar-
bor. Michigan.

An unidentified patient last Satur-
day at Oakwood was reportedly
given injections of what laboratory
tests identiﬁed as “foreign organic
substances.“ which later turned up in
blood and urine samples. The
patients told officials that the injec-
tion. which caused an immediate
scirure. had been administered by a
“man dressed in green tnedical
clothing."

Last July. two Filipino nurses
were convicted of the non-fatal
poisoning of a number of hospital
veterans in Ann Arbor by a federal
grand jury.

During the nurses‘ trial. one vic-
tim testified that just prior to his
breathing failure. he awoke to see a
man in a green medical suit bending

over him. The man reportedly ran
out' the room as soon as he was
sighted.

The two convicted nurses are
currently undergoing court-ordered
psychiatric tests while awaiting
sentencing. Oakwood Hospital in
Dearborn. incidentally. is a mere 30
miles from Ann Arbor. where the
earlier poisonings occurred.

duplicate the conditions on “Face
the Nation" or “Meet the Press.“

Free-lancejottrnalists are hired to
fire questions at the executives on
the hot spot while the cameras run.
recording all the action on video-
tape. The rchearsttls even feature ac-
tors playing the parts of frantic I‘V
directors rushing about the set. giv-
ing urgent hand-signals about up-
coming commercial breaks or that
time is about to expire.

The cost per executive for one day
of private coaching is $2000: while a

.A «comma

For the past six year), Keith‘l'

Stroup (rhymes with “cop'). the
founder of the National Organiza-
tion for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws. has been leading a nationwide
crusade. calling for a repeal of harsh
marijuana laws.

This week. in Calgary. Canada.
Stroup was arrested and jailed on
pot possession charges. The leader
was passing through Canadian
customs on Tuesday on his way to
make a speech at the University of
Calgary. when the bust occurred.

Customs ofﬁcials reportedly first
noted the young attorney‘s lapel pin.
in the shape oftt marijuana leaf; and
then opened his attache case to ﬁnd
dozens of NOR MI. pamphlets
criticizing existing pot laws.

That was apparently enough to
trigger ttn extensive body search:
Stroup was taken into a special
room. forced to strip and was search-
ed. 'l'hc Canadian police say they
eventually found about two grams of
pot in his possession. enough of the
illicit weed to roll two marijuana
cigarettes.

Stroup was detained for a short
while. and was later released on $300
bail. He is scheduled to beincourt in
Calgary on Nov. 2 to face pot posses-
sion charges.
