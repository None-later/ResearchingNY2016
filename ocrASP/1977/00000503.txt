union
dispute

To the Editor:

Why have two Finance Organizers resigned
their position in SUM. and one ofthem having
gone as far as quitting the entire movement? I
can speak for one of them. for I am the one
who quit the moventent. i want you to know
my reasons for quitting. But. before giving
them. i want you to know I whole—heartedly
agree with the ASP editorial appearing in its
Oct. 25 issue concerning SUM. This editorial
was the final part of a series of events that
prompted my resignation. I had wanted to
express what the editoriiil said in the past.
However. I did not feel that it was right to
bring these internal problems to the public.
Now that i know others outside SU M feel the
same way. I believe I should conte forth and
express my dissatisfaction.

My disenchantment started not loitg after
my exposure to SUM. I experienced such
things as: elitism. unauthorized meetings.
unfulfilled pledges. disorganimtion oi
meetings. meetings rushed for expedient‘s
sake. lack of eontntuuieation. ambiguous
proposals. disregard for dissent.
unparliamentiiry procedures. A very small
number of "organizers" have taken on elitist
attitudes in the running of the organization.
Examples of this can be seen in having
unofficial meetings. choking off dissent and
not keeping their promises. ()ne oi the gross
examples of their ilagrant disregard of not
fulfilling promises is fotiitd iii a proposal to
form a committee to specifically deal with
drawing tip models and bylaws for the union.
A consensus was rcaclted iii the Strategy
Committee to bring this proposal before the
general membership. .ltisl prior to the general
meeting of the mass membership. these
"elitists" decided tti take it upon themselves to
avoid a vote on the issue. these people were
members of the Strategy (‘omrtiittee at the
time and ltad agreed witlt bringing this
proposal lttt'tht'd. Ntiw weeks later. this
crucial isstie has yet tti be acted tipon by the
mass membership. as was agreed. Are those.
who are entrenched in power. going to come
forward tti tlte members with one rtiodel and
one set of bylaws. attti ask tltc members It)
“approw” (more like rtibbcr stamp] the plan
that is sure to keep tltcttt iii "power"?

My overridiitg reasoit tor resignation is that
i not disgusted by lite elitism rtttd the control
exerted by elitist ritdiyidtials who are within
and outside the organi/ation. In a way these
people destroy the notion that SUM is truly
democratic atttl based on mass ittcttthership.
You may be asking yourseltcs “why don't I
stay rti SUM and try to change it?"'. well it is
because i hate growrt tired ol trying irotn
witltitt. l’crhaps \oiccs outside SUM will
maltc its leaders aware iil what's happening; I
shall be otteot thoseyorces. because also. there
are still sortie traces in SUM tiyiiig to get
tltrouglt to these people.

I shall support it deiitocratic ttrtioit. itir. oi.
and by the students. bill I cart tto longer
stipport SUM.

To begin with. I cannot speak lot wltat goes

irtipression that his interest rrt SUM stems

others. Ilte fact that he is SA picsidcnt is of
course bettelicral to its. lint there is no reason
wliy a student association should not
throw its stipport behind a Student l'ittoiithat

As far as ollice space is concerned. when

In the Editor:

I am writing this letter in reference to a
serious problem which I ltave recently
discovered plaguing the uttiversity the
hard way. The problem is sectirity. In the past
week. on the first floor of it hall which we will
leave unrtamed. a bike. two wallets. and a
check ltavc been stolen from the dorms: or at
least are “missing”. My loss was the bike.

Only now do I reali/e how vulnerable the
dorms are: ntit only for the few st ttdents who
would be sodishonorrtbleas lti steal frotttthcir
trustiitg iellow students. but also for the
“criminal element" from the surrounding
towns and city. l’ctiplc cart enter virtually any
point on this campus. take wltat they cart and
leave at least tinreportcd if riot entirely
tirtnoticcd.

What cart we do about this problcrti? II we
rtecd to keep titir doors locked or guarded at
all times this place will begitt tti becontc ritore
likca lortrcss than a dortti. One part oi a better
solution involves rciormirig securitics‘ goals
and methods: When I requested the return oi
my cut cltaitt and report on the stolen bike loi'
insurance purposes they ttild me that they
"could not find tltcrtt at the moment anti
would call me back later.“ i have yet to hear
froin iliciit. if they can‘t liiid tlteir own
cy idctice or reports. liotv the hell can they met
lind the stolctt bike?! l‘urtlter. they ttiid tire
that the reported loss would be on the Albany
Police‘s tclctypc. I later called the department
with a possible description of the suspects
(which was giveti by two people that had seen
them “eyeing” the bike rack iii the late
attcrnoon and in the hall later that eyening)
only tti find that the Albany I'olicc Sgt. could
find no existing report of the theft there.

I would suggest that security‘s operation he
run more cl ficicntly iftltcy er en hope to begin
to successfully perform their adnttttcdly
diliictilt tasks. Better placement til their

editorial

 

Today Zone One, Tomorrow . . .

After moittlis of tortuous negotiations. pressure and protest. the
CD'I‘A issue has finally come down to a compromise: Vice President for
Business and Finance John Hartigan has proposed that'CD'l'A provide
late night and weekend service for a short trial period.

the compromise. if CD'IA accepts. could possibly be the best tem-
porary solution for all involved. Although CDTA wanted to take over
the eittire SUNYA bus service. it will now havethe chancctotrythe stu-
dent ittarkct tiit a part-time basis. attd work on any problems or
situations pecttltar to that ntarket.

lly ot'licially discontinuing negotiations. Hartigan ‘an return his
attention it) the more pressing aspect of runninga university: the Cl) I'A
trial period is just that much more time that he won't ltavc to face
pressure iroitt either DOB or SUM or SA. And students will b ‘ able to
view lirst-haiitl exactly what kind of service Cl)'l'A is capable ot'suppiy-
irtg.
What might time been interesting. itltlioughdii'i'icult if not impossible

to itcctiiiiplish. is a trial rttit of (‘|)'l/\’s Zone ()ne service for students.

Asa prorttiticitt part of Ilartigan‘s last package. ZoncOne sct‘y ice was. iii

his words. "a positive factor to offset losses.“

lhis brings tip one intriguing possibility i'ortliecvctttual resolution ol
the ('l) IA issue. A package that incl tidcti the cotttinued scr'yice til the
green buses lor weekday day-time runs up and down Western and
Washington Ayenties. pitis ('l)l’A runs on nights and ..cck‘citds. p/Hs
lone ()ttc service tree to all students.

lltrs would. ol course. involve asi'cablc outlay til'bticks on the part ot
the ttiiiyci'srty. but it would also be a positive iiivestiiicitt iii the city oi
Albany. Stutlcirt accessibility to [one One merchants would increase.
and (IN \ would be criteriitg a deal that would result iii matching
