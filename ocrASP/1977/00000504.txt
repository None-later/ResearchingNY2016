How‘ Do
Our

by Ne" H. lutterltlee

For many years the question of “Who
should be President?“ has provided for many a
heated debate. In most cases of debate. the
procedure hits been to detail the various
qualifications necessary to be president and

‘thcn to match up these qualities to the

candidates.

You might ask (and rightly so) what are the
necessary qualifications to be president. Of
course once we decide upon a certain
characteristic we then must decide how to
measure it: give it a grade.

Many people ttgree that intelligence is a
needed requisite to be president. After all we
do not want it mental midget occupying this
nation’s highest office all though it has
happened before. But how do we measure
intelligence and wltat constitutes intelligence?
In answer to this question I offerthe following
guidelines and prerequisites for determining
wlto should be president; l-irst he(or she) must
hitvc completed some minimal level ol
cducatioit. lhe proof would be a diploma.
Therefore all candidates must hate graduated
(with a Phi Beta Kappa key) from the third
grade. He must have an 1.0. ltiglierthan too or
lower than 63. His reading ability must be well
above that of the average citilen. Hence a
reading test should be administered. in order
to pass this test coittpctancy. oit the level of
“See Spot rttit. Spot rttns fast. run Spot run."
must he achieved, i'.\L‘ll though this next
criteria discriminates against a certain group. I
still helictc iii its iiiipoitaiicc. All presidents
itttist itot he deceased (or dead which eter
yoti pi'clci'.)

A picsideiit itttisl be ttcll coordinated iii
order to throw out the liisi hall ol the baseball
season. He should be able to \talk and chew
gum at the saittc time (this is one ol the tttorc
accttl'alc tests),

A president must be honest .titd not a crook

We Pick

Presidents

(or iit least smart enough not to get caught).
Honesty is ofthe utmost importance.just as
long as it doesn‘t get in the way of thejob.
The president ought to have a good sense of
humor. it also helps if he hits demonstrated
some prolicieiiey with the one liner. Richard
Nixon did itot have a sense of humor: he
thought that he was funny. but he was not.
Howuver. in all fairness to Nixon. he did
provide a lot of material for comics and
impressionists. Jimmy Carter is itot funny. He

NYPIRG in ‘

is smart. but dull. At least (i‘erald Ford was

(Just kidding Jerry. just kidding). Even
George Washington had it‘sense of humor.
although he didn‘t smile much. You could
always count on George for it goodjolie while
sitting around the campﬁre.

Charisma. that intangible trait. is also a
main ingrediettt in a successfttl president. JFK
had charisma. He also find money and a
Harvard accent. lint. on the other hand. Harry

good for a couple of laughs. if nothing else. -

  

.‘l‘ruman didn‘t have charisma. Bathe didn‘t 

need it. he had the bomb and he knew bowto
use it.

There are many other important
characteristics that should be included here.
but i don't feel like goingintothem. However
there is one more aspect of the presidencythat
should be touched upon: what to do with an
cit-president. He can only host the Carson
showjust so many times. And after that what
else is left?

 

 

Understanding the Marijuana Laws

 

by Jim Reilly

'lhe Marijuana Reform Act took effect on
July 29. 1977. updating New York State's
archaic. overly harsh drttg latv with respect to
marijuana possession. l'his tttuclt needed
change was the direct result oi intensive
lobbying attd educational efforts by
NYl’IRU. NORMAL. SASU. and others. as
well as public support lor dL'CI’ilitiltiliiltlliolt. It
took~ a lot of time. effort. and scientiﬁc
documentation to dl’l\’t.‘ the“ltcefcr Madness"
myth lroiit the public and legislative
C(tliNCltthliL‘bh.

Ihe kc) lactor tll tlte tit'l\'t.‘ for
dccrittuitali/ation was education. Hut even
nott that dccriinitiali/atioit has become a
reality. the educational process must continue.

I’cople must he made familiar with the new
law attd all its implications and applications if
they are to avoid expensive littes.jail sentences
and criminal records.

Although penalties have been rcdttced. pot
is still lar from legal. Possession of under
twenty-five grams (about sctcn eiglttlts of an
ounce) of marijuana is a “tittlation”.
punishable by a SllllHX) line. | ighting tip one
joint iii any public place. or passingtltatjoint

Misdemeanor. and citit cost _\iiit $500.00 or
three months to jail. attd possible both.
l’citalitics gct pt'ogrcssttcl) stiller for
possession or sale of greater titiantltcs of pot.
aitd tltc new law doesn't eteit applt to ltashish:
that's still covered by the old drug latv. A

booklet. "NYl'IRG Explains the Marijuana
Reform Act". explains key points of the new
law and is atailable free of charge at the
NYI'IRG office CC 308.

SA‘s idea of printing the itett pot penalties
on the hack of rolling paper packs was a
clctcr. practical way of informing people of
tltc essential lacls about decrittiinali/ation. lt
literally pitt tltc new law directly iiitothc hands
ot those most al'lectcd b_\‘ it.

Rather than considering the association of
the State emblem oit lilL cotci' of the packs
with the new law on the back an insult to the
state its stll ~e legislators hate. perhaps it
should be taken as a liopcl til signlltat thclaws
are siti\\i_\ catching up with the social changes
undergone ht those who ciiiictctl tlteiit.
