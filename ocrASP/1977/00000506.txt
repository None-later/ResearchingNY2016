Albany State basketball team. Pre~
season workouts began Oct. l5.

Trevett. the school‘s all-time assist
leader; along with forwards Cesare
and Audi. and guard Mike
Suprunowicz. the number seven
career scorer: graduated from last
year‘s I9-7 team. Nevertheless. the
Great Danes have seven lettcrmen
returning from that club that won
Albany's ﬁrst SU NY Conference
basketball championship and ﬁnish-
ed second in the NCAA Division III
East Regionals.

The top three scorers are ’back:
junior center Barry Cavanaugh.
junior forward Staton Winston and
junior guard Winston Royal

Best Rebounder

Cavantiugh also was the Danes'
best reboundcr a year ago. averaging
7.4. while Royal set a school record
by convening 89.9 percent of his free
throws.

“We have to get more rebounding

from Cavanaugh and Winston.“

Sauers states. “as well as from Keane
and Verdejo.“ Kevin Keane.the only
senior on the roster. is a swingman
with three years varsity experience.
He gets good position and is strong.
Verdejo is ajunior who came with a
rush the second half of last season.
averaging 7.8 points and 3.6
rebounds coming off the bench.

If Saucrs isn‘t satisfied with his
team‘s rebounding. he may have an
ace in the hole in Kelvin Jones. a
sophomore transfer from Oswego.

He also hasjunior Dave Landry. a
letter winner. and junior varsity
product Gerry Januslcwski as front-
court insurance.

In the backcourt. Royal will
assume team leadership. The little
specdster‘s sidekick will be chosen
from among several candidates and
Sauers is taking a good look at all of
them during pro-season workouts
and serimmagcs.

Other than Royal. the only guard
with varsity experience is junior
Buddy chkliiiski. who lettered. but
scored only 30 points in limited ac-
tion. ’I he best of thc ltCWCOlilcl‘s
