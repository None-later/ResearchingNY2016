shot withthe Cobleskill goalie out of
position. but the ball hit the upper
crossbar and bounced harmlesst
away.

In contrast to the well—played first
half. the second half was filled with
sloppy. physical. and sometimes dir-
ty play.

Cobleskill scored early in the sc-
cond half for a 2-l lead. andthentbe
game deteriorated into a push and
shove contest. A small fight broke
out between a few opposing players.
a yellow warning card was given. and
players were regularly knocked
down.

This violent play may have shaken
up the Danes. for Cobleskill scored
again. this time on a ﬂuke goal.
Castro hobbled aii easy shot off his
body and right onto the fool of a
Cobleskill player. who booted it into
the net for a 3-l Coblcskill lead.

The illegal and dirty play con—
tinued. and the game was stopped
many times. Despite this. the Danes
managed to score a second goal off a
perlcctly sct tip play. narrowing the
('obleskill lead to 3-2.

With the score close. botli teams
incrcascd the amount of unnecessary
roughness. On one play. a (‘obleskill
player ran directly into Castro. and
no call was made by either referee.
both of whom eventually lost control
ol the game.

Sloppy play by the Danes led to
the games final goal. A (‘oblcskill
player stole the ball at midlic'd and
went in all alone on Castro. Castro
came out to cut down the angle. but

unanswered points. The lilﬁli ofthesc

points came on a Mike Mirabella
four-yard run set up by a 43-yard
half-back option pass from ’ Bill
Ziemann to Scott Lusher. '

After Maine was forced to punt.
the Danes began their longest'drivc
of the day. 9| yards. The last 66.
yards came on a run by Haliston.
The PAT was good fora 39-28 lead.

Haliston gained |27 yards on the
ground giving him 708 yards for the
year.

On the following kickoff. Art
O‘Connor kicked a squib kick which
was recovered by Albany Art Auch
on Maine‘s 22. Four plays later.
Aldrich scored on a two-yard run
and Leibowitl added the PA'I‘ for
what appeared to be a commanding
39-28 lead.

But Maine was far from through.
Cosgrovc hit his wide receiver Rich
McCormick with a 36-yard
touchdwon pass and the PAT left
Maine only three points behind.

The fourth quarter was tottilly
dominated by Maine. btit the Danes
wouldn't yield.

“Maine has a great offensiveteam.
but our defensejust came up with the
big plays when it had to." said coach
Ford. Two of those plays were
Hyde‘s interceptions which ended
Maine drives.

Maine did manage to tiethe score
at 39 with a 36-yard field goal but
Albany had the field goal which end-
ed this wild game.

“It was by far the team's greatest
win." said an elated Albany coach.
“Our offense played outstanding all
day. I knew it would take an all-
around tcain effort lti heat Maine
and that's what it was.

“I thought we would have doiie a
little bit better on defense." said
fund.

The Danes could have let down
when Maineapplied the pressure but
they didn't.

“We never cased up at all." said
Ford. “Maine. which tore us apart
all day. kept cotiiing at us but we
didn‘t yield."

lhc Danes return home this
Saturday to take on Plattsburgh. a
team which is not \cry good accor-

ding to Ford.

"'l he tliiitg we lltt\‘c to do against
