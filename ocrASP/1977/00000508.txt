Intro Psychology Subject Pool Abolished

by Aron Smith
and Mike Pearlman

Students enrolled in Psychology
|01 classes this semester are no
longer required to participate in
research experiments or write term
papers.

The requirement was abolished as
the result of a joint decision by Ac-
ting SUNYA President Vincent
IO‘Lcury and Psychology Depart-
ment Chairman Gordon Gallup to
dissolve the subject pool which is
:composed entirely of introductory
iPsychology students.

The decision was made in tin
attempt to comply with an agree-
ment SUNYA reached with the State
Department of Health last week.

SUNYA counsel Thomas Meade
Santoro conceded that some of the
Psychology Department's ex-
periments involving human research
subjects failed to meet Federal and
state regulations. State Health Com-
missioner Robert P. Whitlett ﬁned
SUNYA “00.000 then agreed to
st try the ﬁne providingthc University
adheres to the agreement.

One part of the stipulation re-
quires thut “written voluntary con-
sent“ be obtained from all human
subjects participating in the ex-
periments. Since students in Psy-

chology 101 classes have been re—

quired to participate in four hours of
research or write a terln paper. there
has been some question as to the use
of coercion in obtaining student
volunteers.

In order to allow for the examina-
tion of other methods of obtaining
research subjects. the subject pool
was dissolved by O‘beary rind
Gallup.

"I don‘t want to city it is coercive
or not coercive." said O'Lcary. “New
York is a very special cutie. New
York has it New York law."

“I've asked the Department of
Psychology to suspend the subject
pool right now." said O‘Leary. ad»
ding that “the participation of sub-
jects in experiments will be on it
purely voluntary basis. and there will
be no penalty if the subject does not
participate in research."

SUNYA Continues DNA Research

by Nancy Gleason

Research involving the controver-
sial splitting of genes and forming of
recombinant DNA is currently being
carried out by only one professor at
SUN YA.

Biology professor Joseph
Mascarehaus said he is in the early
stages of research whose long term
goal is to produce plants like corn.
wheat and rice. which will ltuve gene
properitics necessary to directly ﬁx
nitrogen.

The experiments are being con-
dttcted under N conditions. the least
st ringeiit of the four research protec-
tion categories outlined by the NIH
guidelines dealing with recombinant
DNA research.

'l'wo Commence Rensearcli

Two other SUNYA professors.
David Holcitis and Richard
Zitomer. are expected to begin other
recombinant experiments soon.
Their research will be conducted un-
der P-2 conditions.

Recombinant DNA research has
in tlte past come under heavy
criticism from both within and out-
side the scientific community. News

the meantime President O‘Leary felt
it was to our advantage to suspend
the requirement." said Gallup. “This
will necessarily mean it reduction of
the number of available subjects for
the experiments." _

Psychology professor James
jedcschi said,“lt"st1fmoet impossible
to do research in social psychology
without some form of experimenta-
tion."

Tedeschi said one of the main
issues raised by the Department of
Health concerns whether or not
graduate assistants are sufﬁciently
trained to conduct research. “They
don't really do anything that re-
quires training," he said. “It‘s like
stugcdirectionii,and anybody condo
that. My children can do that."

Another problem cited concerns
the “debrieﬁng” of research subjects,
said Tcdeschi. This process involves
informingthc subject, upon tiie com-
pletion ofthe experiment. of exactly
what was being tested and of the test
results. It is a question. he said. of
how tiiuclt information to release to
the subject. A certain amount of

of the establishment of facilities for
such research here at SUN YA caus-
ed controversy earlier this year.

Some opponents to the research
claim the combination of DNA from
unrelated species could produce un-
controllable organisms which could
have adverse effects on the cnviom-
merit.

r1 , y u

Research into gene splitting must
he conducted under guidelines es-
tablished bythe National Institute of
Health. These guidelines spell out
precautionary measures that must be
taken to insure physical containment
of the organisms used in the ex-
periments. Guideline levels of con-
tainntent range from l’-l to P-4.

Zitomer and Holmes have not
begun their research because the re-
quired P~2 facility at SUNYA is not
completed. Zitomcr said. The facili-
ty is expectedto be completed witltin
the next month and experimentation
will begin at that time. he said.

Musctirehuus said his research in-
volvcs an attempt to isolate the gene
in a particular soil bticterium called
tizotobactcr which allows the

"deception" (such as having the sub-
ject believe that a colleague of the
researcher is really a student) may be
crucial to the conduct of an experi-
ment. said Tedcschi. The issue, he
said. is “whether deception in and of
itself involves risk."

“I think there'll be an effect of
making persons a lot more sensitive
to regulations involved here.” said
O‘Lcary. “l have no doubt there will
be a good deal of sensitivity raised
because of this matter."

“The dissolution has obviously
impaired our ability to do research."
said Gallup. “Hopefully the Univer-

sity will get all this behind them." He
did say. however. that the Pay-
Ichology Department will “eventual-
ly be able to reinstate it full-scale
research effort rind move ahead."

Plants like corn. wheat'nnd ricc

themselves. rind are dependent on
expensive fertilizers which contain

Mascurchaus said he is attempting
to recombine two organisms.
azotobacter and E. coli. which iti-

“viiioumentf His research therefore

presents a low risk. and can be done
under P-l conditions.

Zitomer said the P-2 research he
plans to carry out differs from that
being done by Muscarchnus.

Less Predictable Results

“The P-Z research involves recom-
bining two organisms. yeast and E
coli. which do not exchange DNAin
ntiture. Because this isn't done
naturally. the results are less predic-
table." Zitomer said.

Greater precautions are taken utt-
dcr P-2 level research to insure better
physical containment. he said.

Experiments in the past few years
attempting to uncover potential
dangers involved with recombinant
DNA research have revealed no real
hazards. Zitomer said. The risks
pointed to by those who'oppose the
research are hypothetical iii nature.
he said.

“The possible hazards have been
found to be grossly overestimated."
Mascarchtius said. He and Zitotner
said the withdrawl of ii bill in the
Senate. sponsored by Edward
Kennedy of Massachussctts. is an in-
dicatior. of the decline of opposition
at the national level. The bill would
have brought DNA research under
strict governmental regulation.
