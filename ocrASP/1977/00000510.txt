The minor production difﬁculties

only the painting of it and thc iti-
stnllution of the lights. Since it was
not linishcd on scltcditlc. tltc
mttntifuctorcr agreed to donate this
ambulance. of nearly exactly the
some type, for S—Quad‘s use until the

ttiully begin opcrutlon." said Lin-
dttttcr. “licing II van-typc vehicle it is
very different to drive than our
