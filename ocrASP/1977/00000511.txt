The Federal Government reports

it is beginning to be deluged with .

serious requests from patients
around the United States who want
to use marijuana as a medicine in
treating their diseases. Health.
Education. and Welfare Secretary
Joe Califano says that at last count
office had received petitions signed
by 62 people from 22 different states
and the District of Columbia. re-
questing permission to use pot for
medical reasons.

The government currently
classifies marijuana as a highly
dangerous drug with no medical
applications. Howuvcr numerous
medical researchers have reported
that the illegal weed is effective in
treating the eye disease glaucoma
and in reducing the symptoms of
asthma and multiple sclerosis.

BEAMING UP

A U F0 research grorrp claimsthat
the Chilean military government has
clamped a tight lid of secrecy over a
case involving a ('ltilcnn army cor-
poral who. witnesses say. was beatn-
ed aboard a Ilying sauccrlast April.

The case in question reportedly
occurred last April 25th. and in-
volved Corporal Armando Valdcs.
who was on patrol with six other
soldiers in the Chilean Mountains

before sunrise.

According to previous press ac-
counts. 1 he seven-man patrol spotted
a birghtIy-lightcd saucer-shaped ob-
ject hovering nearby. Corporal
Valdcs reportedly stepped forward
and yelled in its direction.

Others in the patrol party are
quoted as saying that Valdes then
disappeared before their very eyes.
and reappeared just as suddenly
about I5 minutes later. Witnesses
claimed Valdcs started aloud as he
reappeared: “You don‘t know who
we are or where we come from but
we will be brick soon.“

Witness to the incident also
reported that Valdcs was clean-
shavcn befor his disappearance. but
that he had about ﬁve-days‘ growth
of beard on his face when he
reappeared. In addition. the date on
his calendar wristwatch had ad—
vanced by five days from the 25th to
the 30th of April. during his bricfdis-
appearance.

The 'I ucson-bascd Aerial
l’hcnomena Research Organization
says that Corporal Valdcs hoped to
undergo hypnotic treatments. in ef-
l'ons to help him recall what happen-

   

ed to him. According to AI‘RO.
however. the Augusto Pinochet
government in Chile has intervened.
ordering all seven soldiers not to dis-
cuss thc reported events with
anyone.

LEWD LYRICS

US News and World Report
claims that the Federal Com-
munications Commission is taking
another hard look at hot-selling rock
and pop songs with an eye toward
cracking down on sexually—explicit
lyrics.

The magazine says that the FCC
last year received more than 2.500
radio listener complaints about
alleged “vulgarities” on the air. Most
of these complaints reportedly dealt
with the lyrics of popular songs.

US News says that among the
"permissive" song titles drawing
heavy complaints are Rod Stewart‘s
“’I'onight‘s the Night“ and Carly
Simon‘s "Nobody Does It Better.“

Ihc Reverch Jesse Jackson's
“Operation I’ush" has alrcatlylauch-
ed a nationwide cursadc in efforts to
force radio stalrons to cut down on
playing songs which deal with sex or

drugs. That crusade. however. is yet
to meet with major successes.

US News says that one problem
opponents of “suggestive” records
are encountering is the fact that the
popular music industry is incredibly
wealthy and successful. The
magazine points out that consumers
paid $2.7 billion. not millions but
billions of dollars. for records and
tapes last year alone; and that Elton
John and Peter Frampton both
made upwards of $50 million apiece
in a mere one-year period for recor-
ding and entertaining.

IMPORTANT IONS

A Univerisity of California scien-
tist says that one reason you may be
depressed or unable to sleep is that
there could be too many positive
ions in the air.

Dr. Albert Krucgcr. a professor of
Biomctcrology. says after more than
two decades of st udy. he had become
convinced that the electrical balance
in the air plays a crucial role in
human behavior.

I’ositivc ions. the ones Krtregcr
says are the bad ones often con-
gregate in hot. dry or polluted air.
