Claudius the Clad?

 

ﬁnds fools. knaves. and madmen as well
as honest and competent men who
_worked hard for the security and welfare
ofthe Empire. Claudius was believed to
be a fool by his own family but surprised
the world by his competence when he
became emperor.

Claudius was born in to 3.0 in
Lugdunum. the modern Lyon. the son
of distinguished parents. His mother was
Antonio. 21 daughtcrol‘ Mark Antonyand
of Augustus‘ sister Octavia. His father
was Drusus. a distinguished general and
son of thc empress Livia. Augustus was
thus his great-uncle as well as his step-
grandl'ather. while 'l'iberius was his uncle
and Caligula his nephew. Nevertheless he
might be classified as a “disadvantaged
person." He was ill much ofthe tinre arid
suffered from some physical deformity as
yet not diagnosed. He stumbled when he
walked and slobbcred at the motith and
starnrncrcd when he was excited.

Claudius was clearly an
embarrassment to the imperial family.
Under Augustus and liberitis Ire had no
official career and no part iii prihlic life.
btrt Caligula granted him it eotistilship in
37 AD. ('lauditis devoted himself to the
scholarly pursuits and wrote major works
on Roman. l’ti'trscan. and ('ai'thaginian
history. liming been trrtored in history by

own selfish reasons. chose Claudius as a
successor to Caligula. They found
Claudius cowering in fear behind a
curtain in the imperial palace, cunducted
him to their camp. and proclaimed his
emperor. Claudius rewarded the soldiers
with a handsome gift; his relationship
with the Senate remained tense.

As emperor Claudius showed marked
administrative ability and devoted
himself to his judicial duties and to such
public works projects as the expansion of
the port of Ostia. He had no military
experience and was unmililary in
appearance and character. but during his
reign the Roman legions conquered
southern and central England; Britannia
became the Empire‘s newest province.
