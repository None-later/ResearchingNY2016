The Trial

Franz Kafka would have been proud. To term the SA Supreme
Court’s handling of the Jurist vs. Wallace case a mockery would only
serve to dignify it.

Perhaps in an attempt to assuage its perennial pangs of impotence, the
SA Supreme Court pronounced its two members a legal quorum and
proceeded onward to new heights of inconsistency.

That Tom Wallace violated election regulations, and that the fall
Colonial Quad Council election should be invalidated was disputed by
no one—not even Wallace. However, the court also removed Wallace’s
name from the ballot in the new election, and declared invalid all write-
in votes for him.

“The court”—all two of them—decided that the violations were
sufﬁcient grounds for removal of the candidate from the ballot.

While this is probably not beyond the power of the court, it should be
well beyond the gall of a two-sevenths full bench.

Nowhere in SA's election law, or its constitution. or in past Supreme
Court cases is there a recommendation for any action other than
invalidation ofthe election, and possibly the censure of anindividual by
Central Council.

Election irregularities have gone hand in hand with SA elections for
years; Wallace‘s case is different only in degree. and in the fact that he
made his accusations against Carolyn Jurist in print. Settinga precedent
like this will only insure that SA will spend a lot more ofits time in future
elections throwing candidates off the ballot.

The court, however, is by no means satisfied here; the court has
ordered Wallace “to apologize publicly to Ms. Jurist by means ofa letter
to the Editor to be printed in the ASP.“ This is only the most recent
manifestation of‘SA's annoying habit of writing the ASPinto its laws
and resolutions.

To mandate that the election commissioner must publicize the
election and the results inthc ASPand on WSUA is foolish, forthe most
part, because of the restrictions placed on SA to run their elections in
accordance with ASP advertising policy.

With the publication of the Legal Services Task Force Report. SA
overstepped its bounds a bit: they have Jack Lester writing a bi-wcekly
column and conducting a radio talk show. There was. ofcoursc. no prior
discussion with either the ASP or WCDB.

Ordering an individual to have a letter printed in the ASPammounts
to ordering the ASPto print a letter; the court is now dancinginan area
over which it has absolutely nojurisdiction. The simple issuance ofsuch
an order shows little or no regard for the First Amendment. it will be
interesting to see howthc SA Supreme Court handles Wallace‘s inability
to apologize as ordered.
