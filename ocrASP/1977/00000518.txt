It’s About Time

 

“Whit"ti’oet"t‘tie' [tinted Bo‘wl Ranking Committee have against the
Albany State football team?

Last 'week they didn't even bother‘to rank the team despite Albany's 5-1
record and victory over Norwich College, which had been ranked seventh
that week. The only thingthat win accomplished was it knocked Norwich out
ofthe top ten.

This week. after Albany knocked off Division 11 power Maine. the
committee ﬁnally came to its senses and realized Albany deserved to be
ranked. And so the Danes were ranked, tenth.

However. the committee credited the Danes with only ﬁve wins. not six,
which may have cost them a few notches in the standings.

It's not as though the committee didn‘t know Albany had six wins. They

didknow. In fact. a committee member had called Albany‘s coach Bob Ford

before the rankings came out. and asked him directly what the team's record
was. But still they managed to screw things up.

One has to wonder if the rankings are really true indications of the quality
oftheteams. Earlier this year. CW. Post was ranked fifth with a 0-1-1 record.
and later seventh with a 1- 1-1 record. Certainly a team that didn't win either
ofits first two games doesii't deserve to be ranked. and ranked fifth noless.

During last year Post was ranked number one and then lost a game to
Ithaca 28-7. the next week. they were still number one.

Next week. if Albany beats Plattshurgh. which is not considered a good
team. the committee will probably ﬁnd some reason not to move Albany up.
They‘ll probably say Albany beat it nothing team.

Luckily for the Danes. when the NCAA Division 111 post-season play
invitations are sent out on November 13. the selection committee for the
NCAA won't look too hard at the Lambert rankings but will instead look at
the teams‘ records and the opponents they played. And considering who the
Danes played. Norwich. St. Lawrence. and three Division 11 schools. Albany
hits a chance at post-scason play. Something they have never had.

For Sale Ibday
NEW YORK (AP) Take it from one
of the middle men, baseball's free
agent re-entry draft today will b“
"sellers" and not a“buyers" market.-

“I foresee a great demand for the
quality players just as in the in~
augural draft a year ago.” says Jerry
Kapstein, the enterprising players‘
agent from Providence. R.I.. “I
think. if anything. the results of a
year ago produced these definite
conclusions:

“One. fans want to see winning
baseball. They don‘t care how t1:
team comes by the players needed
to produce it.

“Two, successful owners try to do
what is best for the fans. They ﬁnd
that winning baseball pays for itself.
through increased gate receipts.

“Three. the dire prediction of
traditionalists that the re-entry draft
would destroythc game proved com-
pletely false. Attendance in 1977 was
the highest in history. The draftfin-
stead of hurting the game. fired hot
stove interest that carried over into
the season.

“Four. another proven mis-
conception tsthiit players signing big
money, long-term contracts would
lack motivation. An overwhelming
majority of the free agents had ex—
cellent season."

bitrators and the courts.
