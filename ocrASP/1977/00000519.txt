Ms vnoss (AP) Ken Norton
remembers very well a sparring
partner he had four years ago~a mov-
ing target named Jimmy Young.

“He 'was very difﬁcult to hit to the
head." Norton recalled Thursday of
the ﬁghter he used to help get ready
fora ﬁght with Muhammad All four

’ years ago.

Norton lights Young Saturday
night in a scheduled lS-rounder and
he reaiiles t hat Young has improved
greatly as a slight-of-hitnd ﬁghter.

“He‘s a spoiler. he‘s a ciutchcr.“
said Norton. “He has a way ofmak-
ing you look bad while he‘s looking
good."

There‘s no doubt that. win oriose.
Jimmy Young can make his oppo—
nent look foolish. and this concerns
Nor! on who feels he needs more t him
just a victory.

“If I win decisively. it‘ll help my
bargaining power with All,“ said
Norton. "it‘ll help force him to ﬁgiit
me.“

Ali has promised to give a title
bout to the winner of the light
between the two top contenders in
the world. Norton is ranked No. l
and Young No. 2 by both the World
Boxing Council and the World Ilox-
ing Association.
