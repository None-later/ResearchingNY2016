The 6-I Danes will be looking for
their seventh straight win against a

There isn‘t much that can be said
for Plattsburgh‘s season. Their only
win this year came against

Budka. a freshman, was a stan-

He was recruited by Albany but was
unable to. enroll. -

One of Budka's problems this year
has been his lack of a supporting
cast. There are no standout receivers
on the Cardinals.

Defensiver it‘s the same story for
the Cardinals. There are no real stan-
douts. Their defense has been scored
upon quite frequently this season.
The 62 points given up to Norwich
last week is an example.

The two defensive players Welch

by Mitch Chaitin

The Albany State men‘s varsity
swimming team opens its l977-78
season this Tuesday with a scrim-
mage against Morrisville.

Starting the team off this year are
eo-captains Dave Rubin and Mark
Jaffe. Rubin. a senior. is working on
his fourth year as an Albany letter-
man.

Rubin holds an irn pressive
amount of Albany swimming school
records including seven individual
(out of fourteen) events and all three
relay teams.

Jaffe. also a senior. is coming off
his best year yet as ajunior. The team
will be lookingto Jriffe for his strong
leadership qualities according to
Albany‘s head coach Ron White.

Other outstanding performances
are expected frotn three returning
lettermcn. Mike Dwyer and Ed
Watkins. holding records in the loo-
yard freestyle and ZOO-yard butterfly
events. respectively. had outstanding

 

freshmen years and are expected to
better their times this year.

Jeff Cohen. senior. is a member of
the record holding 400-yard medley
relay team and will add much depth
to the breaststrokers this year.

Other returning members are
Stefan Stroms. Larry Austin. Harry

bian. Scott Lonsbcrry. Erie Roth

This year‘s diving team. although

freshmen members are Bill

A big surprise addition to this
year‘s team is Bob (ionrcnbach. a

changed).

Coach \Vhitc appears very tip-
timistie al‘ 't this year‘s season.
“We have the potential to be deﬁnite
contenders in this year‘s SUNYAC
championships to be field at ()swego
irt March. With a strong team tirade
up of returning lettermen and out-
standirigl'reshmen (and one transfer)
this could be the year for Albany."

Coach White thinks that this
year's team can vastly improve last
year‘s 7-4 record in the SUNYAC.

5:30 p.m. at the University Pool.

Motel Seizes Cooking Equipment

by Matthew ('ox

Room inspections by the staff of
the Country Squire Motel over the
weekend resulted in the confiscation
of cooking equipment from sc\cr'ri|
student residents.

The cottliscatiotts followed it letter
from tltc lown of (iiiildcrland infor-
rtiitrg the motel that the presence of
such appliances in residence rooms
\iolated town Ioniug ordinances.
Motel manager ind Unser said.

Off Campus Association Presi-
dent .loliri Kennedy eltarged yester-
day iliat Unser ttrilairly led students
to believe that the letter was initiated
by ()CA. Kennedy said Unser was
trying to stir up stirderit sentiment
against hint.

Unser said he thought the letter
might have been a result ol'avisit the
lioard til Ilealth paid the motel last
week. a visit Unser has said was un-
called for. Kennedy called the Board
of Health to the motel last Tuesday
after one wing of the motel had
treating problems.

(luilderland (‘hief Building in-
spector Harold Crounse. who wrote
the letter to the motel. said he took
the action following a phone discus-
sion with motel staff member Linda
Stillson.

“Stillson called the and was corn-
plaining about what students were
doing with the rooms. that students
were cooking rti them." ('rourise
said. “i had taken no actroti from our
office irritil slit: called."

Unser said lie wasn‘t aware that
Stillson made the call. Stillson was
iiiiavrtilabie for comment last night.

Kennedy called the incident “a
blatant attempt to discredit OCA."
He said Country Squire students ap-
proached him Monday tnorning
charging that he had initiated the
whole conﬁscation procedure.

“The motel was justified in mak-

ing the corifiseations. since the
appliances were illegal." Kenn: day
said. “But i don't like the fact that
there was an attempt to imply that I
called the iowtt oi (iuilderirind." he
said.

Unser said he didn't know exactly
hou many appliances had been con-
fiscated. All the rooms at the motel
were inspected by Slillsoti and
another member of this staff. Unser
said.

Unser said the letter from
Crounse. addressed to Stillson.
stated that the presence of cooking
appliances iri residence rooms
violated Inning ordiuaces. The letter
indicated that Crounse had received
one complaint about the presence of
appliances from a student. Unser
said.

Crounse said he wrote the letter
after discussion with Stillson.

"it was a follow up to our discus-
sion. I told her in the letter that we
would inspect shortly. and that if
students were using cooking equip-
ment. the motel would have to
remove it.“ Crounse said.

Candy Wolfson. a student at the
motel. said she thought intially that
Kennedy had made the complaint.

“Some students were told that it
was John Kennedy who made the
call informing the tuning bureau of
violations.“ Wolfson said. “A note
on my door left by the motel said the
confiscations were made by order of
OCA and the 'i‘ownoquilderland."
she said.

Wolfson said she was among the
students who went to question
Kennedy Monday morning on why
the inspections were initiated.

Rick Waks. another student at the
motel. said he too initially thought
Kennedy was responsible for the
letter which led totlie corifiseations.

"it was made direct enoughto me

that they [the motel staff] hadn‘t in-
itiated it." Waks said.

Waits said he felt the motel staff
was justiﬁably upset over the recent
actions of OCA and a committee of
motel residents. A petition was
presented to the motel staffearly last
month by a committee students.
()(‘A representatives. and housing
administrators. demanding change
iti several areas of housing con-
ditions.

“What are they to do in response
to this intimidation?" Waks said.
“They're probably going to do
everythingthey can to ﬁght it. i think
that if the committee had never been
formed. no one would have known
about these hot plates." he said.

Students who had rippliances con-
ﬁscated have been told that they will
get the equipment back at the end of
the semester. Waks said.

He said the motel staff has been
very cooperative in helping students
affected by the conﬁscations to ﬁnd
new cooking arrangements. Unser
has agreed to build a new entranceto
the motel's kitchen and provide
students with access to it for $5.00
for the rest of the semester. alts
siiid.

The kitchen should be ready for
student useina few days. Waks said.
