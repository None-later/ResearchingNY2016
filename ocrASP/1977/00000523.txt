tion on the highly qualified
applicants and setting up interviews

Soda Fizzles Down to a Quarter

The price of canned soda in
machines on campus will return to
25 cents. the UAS Board of Direc-
tors decided yesterday.

The rods price. which was raised
to 30 cents a can this June will be
reduced after Thanksgiving. accor-
ding to UAS General Manager E.
Norbert Zahm.

"We‘re tentatively aiming for the
Thanksgiving vacation.“ said Zahm.
"The machines have to be serviced
for the price change."

Zahm said that last year. UAS
broke even on the soda machines
and that it was decided to raise the
price to prevent a loss. With the in-
crease. a S I6.000 profit was expected
to be made on soda machines this
year. Zahm said.

“Now. we will lose about $3000 a

year. which. when included with the
loss ofS l6.000 in anticipated money
puts us about 320.000 Worse offthan
we were.“ said Zahm.

Zahm added that the price reduc-
tion will probably put the total UAS
losses upto around the 560.000 mark
at the end of the year.

“Paying the extra nickel is a pain
to students.” said SA President Dave
Gold. “We felt that the money was
an unfair burden on an item of sales
which directly affects students."

Gold said that by decreasing the
price. UAS won‘t be substantially
hurt.

“it‘s very clever how he [Zahm]
uses statistics." (iold said. "A
number of things have not been
taken into account. including the
Iact that the original proposed

AFTER THE FACT ‘

A maverick publisher in Detroit
has found a rather unusual way to
sell books.

Advertising Age magazine reports
that last year. Steven West ranafullv
page picture of himself in the New
York Times in the ad. he offered a
"special 20 percent discount“ on
“The l2 most important new books
now being published.“ Readers were
invited to call itt their orders “24
hours a day. seven days a week." to
get in line for such titles as “The
power and the pleasure of sex“ or
“World War III."

Well. it turns out that the books
didn‘t exist. at least trot yet. The only
things already written were the titles.
West now admits he waited to see
which titles were ordered most fre-
quently. lhen he and his "team of
writers. photographers. researchers
and philosophers“ sat down to write
them. (‘usiomers who requested lili-
popttlar titles got polite apologies
and their checks back.

business: " Ihete's no reason \vh) a
