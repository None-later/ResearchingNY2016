Concerts I

It Felt So Good

By JONATHAN HODGES

Given that the hottest ﬂugelhorninjazz
looked and sounded a bit tired. and also
given that many lamented the missing
French horn section, the Chuck
Mangione concert Friday night at the
Palace shines like a sparkling gem in the
otherwise dismal UCB concert series.

Before saying anything else, let me say
YES, I LOVED THE CONCERT. Now
that that‘s out of the way, there are some
observations, yes, even some criticism
about the showthat lwould like to make.

First, I‘d like to again mention that I
though Mangione was hurting a bit.
Many of his solos were abridged. and
some of the high notes just weren't as
clear and sustained as they usually are.
Yet the concert didn‘t suffer. The quartet
was superb.

lf the Mangione horn solos were a little
weak. woodwind specialist Chris Vadala
was better than I’ve ever heard him.
Vadala‘s performance seems inversely
related to Mangione. This summer at the
Dr. Pepper concert series, it was
Mangione who was crisp and clear and
Vadala who oft times was struggling for
identity amidst a sometimes
overpowering background horn section.
Bassist Charles Meeks provided that all

important bottom to the quartet's music.
It just seemed that Meeks was really into
the performance. By the time “The XI
Commandment“ rolled along. Meeks was
ready for a solo that at times became
complex yet always organized, with
Meeks in total control.

After a rough beginning, guitarist
Grant Geissman began to settle down and
play the way Mangione followers know
he can. He seemed to put it all together in
“Legend of the One-Eyed Sailor” and his
acoustic guitar work throughout the
night was excellent.

Drummer James “Jail-Bait" Bradley
was solid, though he did seem to tire close
to the end. While he still needs some
maturing. his style has the ﬂexibility
needed for ranging from the melodic
“Soft”, to the airy feel ofthe new “Maui-
Waui“ to such solid background pieces as
“Chase the Clouds Away."

The selection of songs was ﬂawless. In
an interview after the concert, Mangione
stated that the quartet has 50 numbers to
draw on at any time. The songs seemed to
have been chosed with an eye toward
creating variety throughout, giving the
die-hard Mangione fans what they
wanted, while saving Mangione so he
could still deliver when he needed to.

good backﬁelds.“ said Mangione.

While Mangione drew heavily on his
new album, Feels So Good, he was able to
mix-up the new cuts with the best from
two previous albums, Main Squeeze and
Chase the Clouds Away. It appears that
these three last albums. along with the
Bellevr‘a album, show a reluctance on the
v art of Mangione to radically leave the
Eiliartet format. Reason to cheer for

angione fans. but also a cause of
bitterness in the artist himself.

'“l‘m ‘ kind of disillusioned.“ said
Mangionc as he talked about his
experimentation in the world of
symphonic orchestras. “During all those
years, not one orchestra asked me to guest
conduct. The music still lives, but itjust
isn‘t worth six months of labor to write
for everybody, for obocs or bassoons. and
play it only once.“

Mangione put to rest one of my major i

worries hy sayingtliat the ﬂugclhorn is his
main instrument and that his use of
keyboards will not go much licyrﬂd its
present level.

While I have mentioned that I thought
Mangionc appeared tired. the only reﬁll
alternative would be for the small. frail
Mangioiic to take some time off. a thought
that neither his public, nor the artist
himself. seriously considered.

“l’crl'oriiiiiig is very, very important."
Mangionc declared vehemently.
" Musicians today have lost thcirsciise oi
direction. All they can think about is

_ knocking till I’m six months on the West

Coast, ll that‘s yoiii attitude. they should
put L'\‘L'l)tillt.‘ lo siccp at 55."

Mangioiic has recently written the
scoic to a iiio\|c scheduled to he released
in March. entitled the "('hildicii ol
Sanchcr." Wliilc Miiiigioiic refused to
predict what thc iuturc might hold for
Iiiiii. he did express two desires; to play in
.lapan. and hold more concerts in places
designed to hold concerts. “It‘s really
hard to make it in a toothiill stadium."

lhis past i‘l'ldity night. he and his
quartet made it ill thc l’alacc. It felt so
good.
