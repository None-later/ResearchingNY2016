He first made his appearance on the
international scene in l97l. In January of that
year. Gereral ldi Amin. then Chief of Staff of
the armed forces under President Obotc. led a
military coup and assumed the Presidency. At
first he was revered by his countrymen who
had despised the old President. Amin was
hailed as it liberator. Since then. however. his
purges and tortures have become known
world-wide. His country is ﬂoundering. and he
has been the target of several assassination
attempts in recent years. Each time he has
survived these attacks. and has subsequently
launched a series of purges and executions
which have disgusted the world.

Amin was born in Uganda in I926. when
Uganda was still under British colonial rule.
Amin never attended sclfool past the fourth
grade. At the age of 2| he joined the British
Army as a member of the King‘s African
Riflcs. While in the armed forces of Uganda.

sergeant-major iri I9bl. and finally became
I’i'csidcrtt ()hotc‘s right hand man. He was
appointed (’hicl'ofStaff'. and it was from that

position that he launched his military coup

Alter sci/ittg power. Amin began a series of
purges and slaughtcrs which would eventually
propel him to the position he now holds -~—the
\rorld‘s ntosl ruthless petty dictator. The ﬁrst
to be purged for opposing Amin were some
3.000 Langj Tribcsman from the Northern
part of Uganda. 'l hey had hccnthe backbone
ot the army officers which had remained loyal
to former President ()bote. Brig. General
\luhummad Hussein. the ranking officer of
tltc loyal forces. was one of the first to die.
'\ltcr he was shot. Amin ordered that
llrissctrt‘s head he brotight to him at his home
trt Kampala. Amin. upon receivingthcsevercd
head. placed it on a plate and put it in his
rclrigcrtrrot overnight.

It is said that the first wave of killings irt

are in short supply. and crops are rotting in the
ﬁelds. I '

Amin is best known for his antics in the
international arena. In I975 he made all the
local Britons talte an oath of allegianceto him
while on their knees. Later that year he arrived
at anvoutdoor party in Kampala in a sedan
chair held aloft by three Englishmen.
Following the Israeli rescue at Entebbe. he
accused the Israelis of not being fair because
they used “nuclear grenades."

In Februrary of I977. President Carter. ina

news conference. said that ldi Amin's actions
had “disgusted the entire world." Amin
responded by ordering all 200 Americans in
Uganda to his home. The U.S. expressed in no
uncertain terms that we would not stand for
Amin holding the Americans hostage. and
quickly dispatched a battleship with over
5.000 marines to anchor off the coast of
Uganda. This show of strength obviously did
the trick. and the next day Amin let the
Americans return to their homes after
thanking them for the fine work which they
were doing in Uganda.

Last June he threatened to attend the
Queen's Silver Jubilee in London to give the
English Government what he called “advice
on the current chaotic economic situation in
England."

ls Amin mad? The evidence certainly
suggests some form of insecurity. Amin
apparently believes that anyone a little
smarter than himself wants his job.
Accordingly. he was purged or exiled most of
the Ugandan intellectuals. Most experienced
diplomatic hands don't think that he is insane.
One Western Diplomat has said: “Make no
mistake about it: ldi Amin is not insane. He II
as shrewd as they come. He is devoted to
power. and he has something of a genius for
keeping it.“

Crazy or not. Amin has no business running
Uganda. He is not only a blight for Uganda
herself. but for all of Africa. Die-hard
imperialists in South Africa and Rhodesia
sight Ami n's case as proofthat the blacks can't
govern themselves. He is a frequently used
example when racial prejudice rears its ugly
head.

lhcrc have been several attempts on Atnin‘s
file this past year. the last one comittg close to
succcdrrtg. I think that these attempts will

To the Editor:

I have enclosed. within. a copy ofa letter
that was sent to Dave Gross. SA Election
Commissioner today; since l feel that the
students not only of Colonial Quad. but also
of the university community. have a right to
know of the final outcome of the Colonial
Quad Central Council Elections.

To: Dave Gross. SA Elections Commissioner
From: Tom Wallace. Candidate for Central
Council. Colonial Quad

I am hereby informing you. as SA Elections
Commissioner that in accordance with ART.
II Sect. 3 of the Elections Regulations Act. I
am removing my name from the. ballot and
declining to run for Central Council. Up to
this point. I have considered myself a
candidate for Central Council. despite the SA
Supreme Court‘s rulings. These rulings and
the precedents they have established have been
unjust. unfair. and unconstitutional. The
Court has overlooked its basic function and
purpose in dispensing rulings that have no
foundation in justice. Specific actions that
exemplify this spirit of injustice pervadingthe
Court are: denying my right to appeal a
decision of the Court. doing so in a closed
hearing where no one could attempt to voice a
dissenting opinion or to defend my case. the
denial of the right of the people on Colonial
Quad to vote for the candidate of their choice
by removing my name from the ballot. then.
even denying me the right to run and the right
of people to vote for me even in the form of'a
write-in ballot. and creating a law in an ex-
post-I'acto fashion.

While I feel that the Court‘s decision must
be challenged. due to its unconstitutional
nature. by further appeals. I have requested
those individuals that I know of. who were
considering such action. that they discontinue
it. I have done this in order to end this
controversy so that elections may be held and
the Quad t be represented fully in Central
Council. ‘

While I feel that the Court‘s decision must
be contested due to their unconstitutional
nature. and while I feel that I am in the right
and that justice would eventually prevail. I
know that l have a greater obligation to the
residents of Colonial Quad.

When I was actively campaigning for
Central Council. I promised that I would
attempt to represent the best interests of the
Quad. 'Ihe voters on Colonial Quad elected
the in good Iaith. Now. il I carry this legal
action out to its conclustort. it could take as
lttng as two-to-four weeks before another
election could be held. durirtg wlticlt time. the
Quad would be without full representation on
thc Central Council. I feel that I have a moral
obligation to the people on Colonial Quad to
irtusrc them the representation they merit.
I'hc voters on Colonial Quad clcctcd me in
good faith. arid I must return tltcir showing. In
this light. the only honorable course is to end
the controversy. despite the potential long-
term dangers. arid to ask for immediate
elections on Colonial Quad without my tiarnc
on the ballot.

l ltupcthat my dccisiott will be borne out as
intelligent iii the course of events.

On Wednesday night Central Council was
informed of all irregularities pertainingtothe
fall Central Council election on Colonial
Quad. During Ilruce l’laxctr's report on the
Colonial Quad issue. we heard Iotn Wallace's
appeal and Supreme Court's decision. We
question the constitutionality of the Supreme

Although it was within the boundaries of

The Last Resort

Difficulties at the Country Squire Motel continue. . .

The problem this week clearly illustrates how badly the situation there
has deteriorated. The confiscation of illegal student cooking appliances
has proved less of an issue than who was responsible for starttngtt all.
No one, including the students involved, seems to be upset about the
action. The incident has instead served to fuel further argument between
these tw0 increasingly hostile factions. , i
The Off Campus Association and the managers of the Country Squire
Motel are both upset with one another. OCA feels the motel has failed to
live up to its committments to provide students With adequate houstng
and transportation, and the motel staff is angered at the legal threats and
intimidation leveled against it by OCA.
Both have acted predictably given the
neither has managed to appreciably improve con
living there.
At the start of the semester there were 68 students at the Country
Squire; a month ago. there were 5l students. and the number has grown
still smaller. Students who chose the Country Squire as a last resort have
