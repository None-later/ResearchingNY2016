Student Affairs Services

; ﬁns" Gro-
u  III Hayes
‘ This university has a responsibility to provide

a learning environment that enables students
‘0' ow as human beings. and not socially
intherted r and specialiZed machines and
bookworms. It must create a learning
environment that provides opportunities and
mistance in facilitating the students‘ total
development. Total development is not just

, knowledge gained from classes and studying

in the “brary” but encompasses the student‘s
development as a human being. This
university must distinguish itself from other
institutions in our society by creating a
learning environment that seeks to facilitate
this. We therefore must realize that new
classroom elements of this university have a
vital and important impact on students.

The Student Affairs division is one of the
major’educational units of SUNYA. it is
responsible for the enactment oi the
University‘s commitment to develop and
maintain an environment that enables
students to grow as total human beings. This
growth must be a result of the dynamic
interaction of the student with the university
environment.

The Student Affairs Division‘s primary
responsibility is the identification. initiation.
and implementation of programs and services
for students which were designed to maximize
the student‘s total development. In addition. it
must participate significantly to the
formulation of university policy. Given these
priorities. responsibilities. and commitments.

Itt‘t't/s,

it is up to this university community. and
especially students. to see that they are carried ‘
out.

What a lot of students don't realize about
Student Affairs is the wide range of services
the division offers. One of the more useful-
services is the gareet‘ Planning Student
Counseling Center. Located on the first floor
of the Administration Building, this office has
information on career planning. including
books and magazines on job prospects for
women and minorities. in addition to the
regular information students look for when
considering a future career.

The center operates to a greater scale as it
place for students to air their personal

problems. There are six full-time

psychologists present at all times who are' chance! in “MGM “all. “I”: ll [Sim

willing to help students with any emotional
problems. There is complete conﬁdentiality
on all cases. and the center offers the
advantages of being centrally located without
havingto be worried about being seen entering
a “counseling center”.

Another service offered by Student Affairs
is a placement service for students and
graduates. A student‘s name and jobinterests
are kept in a computer file, and is referredtoa
firm whenever it requests job prospects. The
only charge for this is a SLOO handling fee each
time your transcript is sent out.

To make sure that Student Affairs Division

meet these responsibilities and  to
Affaifs Council within the Senate which
provides direct input into the syﬂem.
Consisting of students. administration. and
faculty. it considers all aspects of student life
outside of formal instruction program and
,maintenance functions of the university.
.Presently. the council is investigation the

' solicitations. and more. But this council can
only be effective to initiate programs for
students if students and this university take an
active role in the process.

Defending the Panama Canal in 2010

of Ronald Reagan's takemer ol the Canal.

(except lot a lcw minor delcnse arrangements.
written iii Latin lot better understanding) of
the “Panama Canal“ was supposed to he
turned in er totiic l’ananiaiiiitiiis, However. in
a surprising iaid on the ('iiiial loite area.
Reagan (still the ex-goiernor ol California)
and a hand ol his supporters took over
complete lltllllitl') control iii the name ol “ fire
48 lliiitcd States iil Attierica." lit lcadiiigthe
llll‘tlt‘h on the ('anal. Regan was thought to
itittc shouted “Retriemhcr the Alamo." l titer
till it was rcicalcd that he actually had said
"Witt one lot' the Upper." lhe paper which

had originally covered the story apologilcd
for the apparent misquote.

Regan. who has not left the Canal area since
he took it over ten years ago. said in a recent
interview that he doesn't foresee any need for
reopening negotiations with Panama over the
status of the canal. He also added that. in
order to beef up security around the Canal. he
will he tiddiiig the tamed iicutrom homhto his
defense ttrscnttl.

As yoti all remember the last time that the
neutron bomb was used in November of
IWI in midtown Manhattan. Several
hundred suavc anti dehonair “urbane-
guenillas” had taken over the old Barrymore
theatre in protest to wltat they termed “a
general lack oi sophistication on the ptirt of
the geneial public." lltcy demanded free

passes to Billy Carter's latest play("l Love My
Sclilitr“). In response to their demands the
Mayor of New York ordered that a neutron
bomb be deployed in the theatre. All of the_
known “urbane-gorillas" were killedﬂ the
theatre remained unmarred. It reopen to a
packed house the next day.

But getting back to Ronald Reagan and the
“ American Canalf‘ the anniversary
celebration is supposed to start later today
with the Still Ex-(iovernor‘ Reagan
officiating. There is a tremendous fir orks
display scheduled (not too close to th Canal
though): and various other commemorﬁ!
events. One of these events (the highpoint of
the l'csivities) is the eontinuous-nonstop-48
hour Ronald Reagan film festival.
