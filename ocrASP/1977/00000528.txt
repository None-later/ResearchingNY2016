NEW YORK (AP) George been ac-

said the mother of the former world
heavyweight champion. “I ’Ipect he

may be wantin' to get back in the ’

ring. ~

“After all, fightin‘ was his world. I
was all he ever did. It was all he lived
for. If it would make him happy. i
wouldn't raise any objections.“

ls George Forman. who demolish-
ed .Ioe Frazier twice and stopped
Ken Norton in two rounds. planning
a comeback?

Such a rumor circulated today in
the wake of Ken Norton's split deci-
sion victory over Jimmy Young and
the failure of champion Muhammad
Ali to deﬁnitely commit himself to a
bout with the winner.

Naturally. the ﬁrst thing to do was
put in a call to George. But where
was George?

The George Foreman Develop-
ment Corp.. 3|20 Southwest
Thruway. Houston. Texas. said the
boss wasn't around. He had gone to
Marshall. That‘s the little Texas
town where Georgi: was born.

would pass the message on to
George. He was out somewhere
evangelizing.

In April. after a shocking defeat at
the hands of Jimmy Young.

Foreman told of a vision from
Heaven which directed him to go out
and give the message of the Diblc to
the masses.

“I go where God leads me.“ hc
said.

Less than a month later he an-
nounced he was retiring from the
ring because of his religious beliefs
and his love for his mother.

George's mom. who was separated
from Forcman's father when their
son was 5. said that was so when
George first began his ring career but

not necessarily ihe ease now. .  ,

Foreman‘s re-etnergence. would ‘
give a boost to a sport that Is
threatened by there-run doidrums.

What's next? A fourth Ali-Norton
bout? Perish the thought. Fifteen-
founds of packaged boredom. prov-
ing nothing. A comeback by
Smokin’ Joe Frazier against Ernie
Shavers? The Society for Prevention
of Cruelty to Old Pugilists wouldn‘t
stand for it. A succession of Burns of
the Month for the great Ali? Forget
it

Heavyweight boxing is in trouble
Ali's act is asjaded as Milton Berlc‘s
Comedy Hour.

Only Foreman. age 29. is capable
of generating new excitement. A 6-
foot-4. 225-pound monster. he has
provcn he can crush any man he can
catch. as Frazier and Norton will
attest. He was neutralized by Ali's
rope-a~dope in Zaire and Young‘s
fancy counter-punching in Puerto
Rico. defeats he could charge off the
nuivetc.

“He got going too fast. he never
got a chance to breathe." said his
sympathetic mother.
