00.4 Requests Motel

by Steve Bracken

Off Campus Association Presi-
dent John Kennedy requested
yesterday that the State Board of
Health and Attorney Gcncral's _of-
lice investigate the Country Squire
Motel.

The request for the investigation is
the result of the motel‘s breach of
contractual agreement with students
living at the motel. Kennedy said.

Kennedy charged that the motel
did not provide adequate transpanm
tion for students to and from
SUNYA. occasionally failed to heat a
number of student's rooms, and
recently confiscated studcnts
ltolplatcs without notice.

of the ()8 students housed at the
motcl in the beginning of the
semester, Kennedy said, one-third
have moved out.

Motcl Manager Ed Unscr said
that OCA‘s complaints are not valid.

“Even though one-third of the
students have left. I still hnvc clcvcn
van runs to SUNYA cvcryday," Un-
scr said. “I'm losing money every

time the van pulls out."

He added that two memos were
distributed to students concerning
the hotplates in their room before
the appliances were seized

“Those memos did not say that
the hot plates would be conﬁscated,"
‘Kcnncdy said.

According to SUNYA on-campus
legal representative. Jack Lcstcr, the
breach of contract issue involves
three types of students-those who
have paid their contracts and left the
motel, those who have paid and have
stayed, and thosc who have not paid
and left because of the problems.

Kennedy said that this latter
group left on advice from their
lawycrs, and ihat"thcyarc entitled to
rent abatement and are taking tltc
motel‘s management to small claims
court.“

Unscr said he was at fault for un-
fairly leading students to bclievcthal

Faculty Committee Begins Deans Evaluations

by M. .i. Memmott

Dean of Social and Behavioral
Sciences Richard Kendall and Dean
of Sciences Vinccnt Cowling are be-
ing evaluated by faculty committees
according to Vice President for
Academic Affairs David Martin.

Committees will also evaluate
Dean of the School of Business
William Holstein and Library Direc-
tor James Schmidt, Martin said.

'l'hc comn'ittccs were formed to
evaluate the Dean's performances in
order to make suggestions on better-
ing future work by them. Sinccthcsc
evaluations have never been made
before, anything that comes out of
them should be very constructive,
said Martin.

Committee members names were
submitted by the College Faculty
Council to him and were subject to
his approval said Martin. The com-
mitlccs will be evaluating cach Dcan
on the basis of his past performance,
and will submit those evaluations to
him. Martin will take any
recommendations he makes from
the evaluations and submit tltcm to
Acting President Vincent O'Lcary.

Final decisions could range from
suggestions to change certain
behavior or methods, or to establish

 

a time when the Dean will step down.
Martin said. He stressed the com-
mittee‘s work asconstructivc, as they
will be looking into past practices in
order to better future ones.

Martin has met with the Kendall
Con‘mittcc once according to
Anthropology Professor Robert
Carmack, a member of the com-
mittee. At that mccting the members
of the committee expressed concern
to Martin over whether their evalua-
tion would be taken into serious ac-
count in any ﬁnal decisions. Car-
mack said. Martin assured them that
it would, and that they wcrc charged
with an important task according to
Cormack. 'l’hc Kcndall committee
will gather information primarily
from five sources, Cormack said.
Thcy include a qucstionairc about
Dean Kendall which will have been
circulated among those directly con-
ccrncd; a review of past annual
reports the Dean hits made; a self-
cvaluation made by Kendall; infor-
mation from department heads and
other Deans; and hcarings where
both faculty and students may speak
about Kendall.

The decision to hold the hearings
was rather controversial and some
members of the committee were op-

posed to them, said Carmack. He
said that all the members of the com-
mittee are tenured faculty, relieving
them of any fear of rcpcrcusions
from their evaluation.

“It's a tough committee. frec-
thinking, with no fear because
they're tenured, but they're also very
fair and interested in giving a fair
and strong report." said Carmack.

According to Kendall, "It will be
good for me to have the beneﬁt of
othcr's views and ideas. it think that
there isa great dcal potentially that is
constructivc, the idca has been dis-
cussed for some time."

"The agenda ofthc committee is to
do things that will conducc to the
betterment of unit," Kendall said.
He maintains that cvcryonc in the
committee has approached the job
constructively.

Kendall would express no opinion
on the possible outcome of the com-
mittcc's evaluation. "What other
people might call asscsts is hard to
say, and only a few people are
perfect, the rest of us need help,“

The Cowling committee was
formed yesterday, according to At—
mospheric Science Prof. Jai Kim.
Kim said an organizational meeting
is planned for today and their func-
tion is the same as the Kendall com-
mittee. Whilcthc Kendall committee
has been in operation and meeting,
the Cowling committee has been
slower in organizing. Kim said.

Sociology Prof. Richard Hall is
chairman of thc Kendall committee
and Computer Science Prof. Dean
Arden is chairman of the Cowling
Committee. Members of the com-
mittccs are from varied departments.

Results of the Kendall evaluation
should come by the end of this
semester, Martin said, while the
Cowling group may not be ready un-
til ncxt scmesicr. He also said that
since this is the ﬁrst time Dean
evaluations have been made, the
process itself may be a little rough
and require changes in the future.

“Dean evaluations seem to me to
bc a kind of natural, organic activi-
ty," commented Kendall.

violated zoning ordinances.

“I just assumed that the letter
came from OCA," he said.

Unscr said that the motel was
without heat for a day as a result of
mechanical problems ' from the
change of air conditioning to heat.
He added that the problem occurred
early in the semester.

“That's an outright lie,” Kennedy
said. “The heat was off on ﬁve
separate occasions. He ran out of oil
due to bad planning."

SUNYA's Problem

Most of the problem is on
SUNYA‘s shoulders, Unscr said. His
action now would be to take
SUNYA to civil cottrt to get back
money he has spent on the van and
other services, he said.

According to Kennedy, earlier in
the semester OCA tried to negotiate
with the motel‘s management twice,
and a third meeting was cancelled by
Unser.

“l have fourteen students who
have refused to pay their contracts,"
Unscr said. “What am l supposed to
do, throw them out in the street?“

Kennedy said OCA feels that the
students should not bc liable forthe
full amount of the contract, because
no all of the agreement have been
fulﬁlled.

When asked why he accepted the
funded students (those who could
not pay upon arrival at the motel) in
the ﬁrst place, Unscr replied that
when the decision to house students
was made,“Evcrything happened so

quickly."
Unscr added that he was underthc
impression the funded students

would pay him with in three weeks to
six weeks after the beginning ofthc
scmcstcr. but that he still has not
received the money. “I had no idea
that i would have thic amount of
money still outstanding," he said.

He said that he will house students
next semester, but not with a con-
tract through SUNYA. “I don‘t plan
on doing business with the university

again.“ he said.

According to Kennedy, OCA
rccommcnds that students not live at
the motel again. “Only two plan on
staying next semester," he added.

Director of Residence John Wclty
was not available for comment
yesterday afternoon.

UCC Passes No Smoking Proposal

by Denise Lend

A sub-committee of University
Senate has resolved to prohibit
smoking in conﬁned public areas on
campus.

Acting President Vinccnt O‘Lcary
had sent a memo to tile University
Community Council asking advice
on how to implement a no-smoking
policy.

The proposal which states "'l'hal
the University Cotmnunity Council
adopt the policy that smoking in
classrooms, lccturc halls. libraries.
theaters, museums, elevators, and
laboratorics is prohibited on this
campus." was passed unanimously
by UCC at Monday‘s University
Scottie meeting.

According to Vice President for
Uncht'sity Affairs Lewis Wclch, the
resolution is a proposed policy
which has still to be reviewed by the
Executive Committee of the Senate
and the University Council for
recommendations about implemen-

tation and enforcement.

After these rccommcndtttions, the
revised resolution must go back to
O'Lcary for approval before no
smoking can become University

Policy.
According to Chairman ofthc Ex-
iccu'tivc Committee Donald

Bishko, the resolution will be dis-
icusscd byihc committcc at their next
mccting Nov. 2|.

In his mcmo, O‘Lcary said that a
number of persons on campus have
recommended a uo-smoking policy
because of health rcasons and dis-
comfort of non—smokers.

Last ycar‘sdrivc to end smokingiu
classrooms was the rcsult of a re-
qucst which came after a resolution
by the Environmental Decisions
Commission which emphasized a
[variety of health and safety factors.

O‘Lcary said that an appropriate
way to deal with enforcement was
yet to be determined. However. he
Ihopcs thcrc is‘cuough student and

faculty support of the policyto keep
cnforccmcnt from becoming a
problem.

chcral students have said they
feel a rte-smoking policy is needed
on campus bccausc smoking is
irritating in class and in small areas
such as laboratories. elevators, and
theaters.
