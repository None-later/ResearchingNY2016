 Program combats

(PNS) Iii an ambitious new pilot
program to combat massive un-
employment in California‘s urban
ghettos, Gov. Jerry Brown is
launching a "storefront" National
Guard armory in a former down-
.town supermarket here. The ﬁrst
recruits . jobless urbnn youths. are
arriving early this month.

If successful. the Brown plan
could boost the governor's rumored
aspirations to challenge Jimmy
Carter in I980. especially since
Carter‘s own plan for youth un-
employment has yet to matcrializc.’

The Guard program is the
linchpin of a larger scheme. not yet
fully spelled out, which aims to use
Oakland as a laboratory for ex-
perimenting ‘ with using state
management assistance to help cities
get the most out of available state
and federal funding sources.

State National Guard units. for
example. get 94 percent of their
money from Washington. intended
primarily to bolster national
defense. ln Oakland. these funds
would be combined with aid from
the state of California to serve an ad-
ditional purpose: providingjobs for
the 40 percent of Oakland minority
youth estimated to be out of work.

Here‘s how the plan will work:

The California Employment
Development Department (EDD).
which runs the state employment
service, will locate suitable male and
fcmnlecandidatcs.drawn fromthosc
who come into their Oakland offices
looking forjobs as well as from peo-
ple recruited in schools and com-
monily'groups.

,_ Thosc chosen will get 30 days pre—
basic preparation from the Califor-
nia Guard to insure that they don't
gwnsh out“.

" Then they will go out tothc US.
Army for basic training. followed by

 

 

instruction in marketable skills like
electronics. truck driving and‘cook-
"18- . .
While they're away, EDD will ﬁnd
them‘ civilian jobs with .Oakland
employers using their new skills.
After training. they will serve out
their six-year hitch at home in
Oakland. workingut these jobs while
being paid the usual” wages to carry
out the Gutird obligations of drilling
one weekend a month. attending ll

two-week summer encampment. and ‘ ‘

being on call forcmergencies like
ﬁres. earthquakes and civil distur-
banccs.‘

Maj. Gen. Frank S. Chobcr, com-
manding general of the California
National Guard. is the chief propo-
nent of the plan. He is an articulate.
urbane man who has a master’s
degree in public administration from
Harvard and quotes Hegel in
conversation. I

Even with the ﬁrst recruits virtual-
ly on the doorstep. many program

details are still huzy. Even the name.

is still up for grabs.
The New Guard

EDD likes IMPACT (Innovative
Military Program and Carrcr Train-
ing). Luconic California Guard of-
ﬁcers call it “The New Guard".

“The governor insists that we call
it the Provisional Organization of
the National Guard (PONG)."
Schobcr reports. “He likes it for two
reasons: ‘provisionul‘ means you can
fall back. rcgroup.do something else
if it doesn't work. Then. he kind of
likes it because of the Provisional
IRA."

The June election of Lionel
Wilson as Oakland‘s ﬁrst black
mayor with ample campaign
lassistancc from the Brown Ad-
ninistrationwas the catalyst that

.moved the plan into action. The

Guard idea had been circulating for

March. (Overture: also had been"

made to San Francisco. but met with
a cool reception from Mayor George
Moscone, according to an
administration source who declined
to be named.) . ‘
As yet. Mayor Wilson will not
comment publicly on the plan. and
the governor‘s powerful executive
secretary. Gray Davis. insists that

nothing will happen in.0okland-g

novative ideas. which is formulating
the Oakland desigllonyl; that the
mayor has béen briefed privately and
supports the plan in principle.
Formal approval of details probably
will come after. Wilson assures
himself that there is no signiﬁcant
community ‘opposition to. any
particular element.

The outline ofthc Oakland experi-
ment appeared in a San Francisco
newspaper September 27. the day
before a scheduled “town mceting“in
Oakland. There a galaxy of high
level administration ofﬁcers. in-
cluding General Schobcr. met 800
people at an Oakland high school for
a forum an citizens' relationship to
state government.

At the town meeting. suggestions
for bringthc National Guard back to
Oakland for any purpose the last ar-
mory there closed in I939 were
greeted with reserve or outright
hostility by minority community
leaders. Schober himself received a
chorus of boos and catcalls when
appeared on the stage in uniform.

to Officer Lsremorc of the
Guildcrland Arson Squad, several
suspects are presently being checked
out. The names of the suspects afe
not being released by the police. Z

Larcmore said that the ﬁre was of
unknown and suspicious origin and
that the Arson Squad is awaiting
laboratory reports from the State
Police laboratories on campus. They
hope to ascertain just how the ﬁre
was started when the lab reports are
received at the end of this week._

Arson is usually committed cit her
Ifor insurance money or revenge.
There is some confusion in deter-
mining cxnctly 'who owns the
restaurant and who might receive in-
surnncc money. Because so many
people might have an interest ill the
place the possible motives for arson
are many. ’

Edward Newman. who was '
operator of the restaurant until it
closed three weeks before the ﬁre.
reportedly called the blaze a “spite
firc.“

Arson is a substantial problem in
the SUNYA urcu. Approximately
one out of six building ﬁres in
Guildcrland arc the work of ar-
sonists.

More than a dozen cases of
suspected arson have taken place in
Guildcrland during the last year. The
situation in Renssclaer is much
worse. Arson has been a major
problem in that city for the last ﬁve
or six years. More than twenty
suspicious building ﬁres have oc-
curred in chsselacr within the past
several months. '
