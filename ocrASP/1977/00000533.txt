. SPRAY SOCKS. .
' Are you ready for sﬂray-on
clothes?

The head of Georgia Tech's Tex-
tile Engineering Department, Dr. W.
D. Freeston, predicts that garments
made by spraying synthetic
chemicals on mannequin like forms
are just a few years away.

Freeston, in fact, thinks that the
spray-on garments will largely
replace those that are woven. and
that consumers won't be able to telli
the difference between the two. He
predicts that underwear, draperies.
and utility clothes will soon be
cranked out by textile plants using a
sophisticated spraying process in
place of Weaving, spinning. and
stitching.

OFF THE HOOK

President Carter and Attorney
General Bell have apparently decid-
ed to let former CIA Director
Richard Helms off the hook. by
allowing him to plead no contest toa
mere misdemeanor. instead of
charging him with the felony of per-
jury for lying to the US Senate.

The former director ofthe Central
Intelligence Agency in I973 twice
denied before the senate foreign
relations committee that his agency
has funneled money into Chile via
the in corporation in order to
destabilize the elected Marxist
government of Salvador
Allende.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports
that federal prosecutors had con—
sidered indicting Helms for the ma—
jor crime of perjury because of his
false statements to the congress. The
newspaper adds. however, that
Helms was widely quoted as saying
that if" he was indicted. he would. in
the paper‘s words, “ ‘bring down‘

Henry Kissinger.” : ' '

'The Sun—Times, says.asa result“,

Helms was allowedto plead"no con-

test” to the much lesser offense of‘
failing to answer the senators “fully.”

about the US role in bringing down
an elected foreign government.

SPONGE ESCAPES

Government scientists report that
a giant sponge which had been cap-
tured in a radioactive dumping area
under the sea had escaped.

The strange sponges were seen for
the ﬁrst time last year when divers
dropped photographic equipment to
depths of 3000 feet under the ocean
off the San Francisco coast. At the
time. the researchers were checking
for possible radioactive leakage
from barrels of hot atomic wastes
which were dumped into the area 25
years earlier.

The giant. four-foot-long sponges
are unlike any other creature ever
found along American coasts. Scien-
tists, however. dismiss the idea that
the animals might be radioactive
mutants. They suggest that the
sponges are attached to the radioac-
tive barrels merely because the steel
drums are smooth and easy to cling
to.

A submarine used a claw this past
Weekend to snag one ofthe creatures
and bring it 3000 feet upto the sur—
face. At the last minute. however. the
sponge managed to shake itselfloose
and sink back down to the ocean
depths. The researchers believe the
sponge which escaped was subse-
quently eaten by sharks in the area.

Newman. it turns "out. writes
jingles for TV and radio commer-

such tunes as “Mama Told Me Not

scribbled the ditty that proclaims
“ Dr. Pepper is the most original soft

Newman also revealed that in two
years prior to the release of his latest

only after he rented an office in
downtown Los Angeles and com-
muted to work. putting in an eight-

UNSEEN HALO

A University of Michigan
Physicist claims he has discovered an
invisible halo of matter surrounding
a galaxy 80 million light years from
the earth.

Dr. Dennis Hegyi says the halo
consists of billions of previost un-
seen stars. He suggests that the halo‘s
existence may answer one of the
most puzzling and fundamental
questions facing science today.

Hegyi says that if other galaxies
also have similar invisible halos,
these halos would account for
enough matter in the universeto pre-
vent the universe from expanding
forever. The physicist says that his
discovery indicates there is enough

“English l00" isn‘t a very catchy
course name, so a University in
Pennsylvania has come up with one
better suited to its students' interests.

Next semester, Temple University
will be offering an introductory
literature course titled “incest.
Adultery and Murder,” a course the
catalog says will deal with “taboos
and otherwise illicit blood
relationships.”

Required reading for the course
will include such shockers as

"‘Wuthering Heights,“ “Oedipus

k Stuyvesant Plaza. Albany

Rex," and “The Scarlet Letter."
