want to see anyone. You. you feel ugly. Your
hair is stringy "and all  up. your face is
pale and drawn. you eyes are bloodshot and
sad. You. you look like Hell.

Three hours. three hours before the test.

Frantically. you waste precious time deciding

how much time you‘ll spend studying each
topic. There's too much to be done. there isn't
enough time. You bury your head in your
notes; you read the words. but they don‘t mean
anything to you. You. you can't concentrate.

. and you have so much to do. Time. there isn‘t

enough time. There‘s never enough time, you
always waste too much time. You. you'll never
get anything done....You. you are indespair.

You. you don‘t do anything any-
more. You _eat away at yourself. You.
have to study. so you don‘t visit friends
anymore. you don't do anything. you don't go
anywhere. You spend all your time studying
and nothing ever gets done.

You. you spend your whole life studying.
supposedly studying, and you never study
enough. You waste all you time away. You.
your mind is always moving. wandering. you
can never concentrate on your work.

You, you leave the library. You can’t study.
and you can't sleep either. You‘re too wound
up. you‘retoo worried. you can't sleep. Fifteen
minutes race by. then a half hour...you still
can't study. You walk around aimlessly.

You. You're ﬁnished. You‘ve failed. You've

screwed all your courses. You. you’re behind in
every course. you can‘t ever do anything. The
more you worry. the less you do.
‘. You. you‘re trapped. you‘re always tired.
always scrambling. always behind...always
failing. Things get worse. and you can‘t do
anything. You. you‘ve screwed your life.

'Somehow. you calm yourself. You play
pinball. you go virtually scoreless on two
consecutive balls. You drag yourself back to
the library. You study. frantically. skipping
around to a million different things.
remembering nothing. Nothing gets done.

You wake up - it‘s three or four hours later.

_ lt's dark out. No one's around. They‘re all at

the library. studying You make yourself a

second; more work is piling up. You're
overloaded with work. you can never catch up.

You want to scream. You have to get away.‘

You. you put on your warmup pants, you pull
on your, U.C.L.A.‘ sweater. Wishful thinking.
the sweater is. You. you jog slowly to the
track. feeling the slow movement of you body.

You climb the fence. and you feet rest
agath the hard asphalt of thetrack. You run.
Your leg stretch. You feel the rhythm of your
arms and legs. you feel the purposeful
movement of yourentire body. You run faster.
Your bean races. You breathe loudly and
heavily. You‘re whole again. a mind and a
body. A moving. running body. You run faster
and faster. gasping louder and louder. running
from the tightness that has been closing in
upon you.

You run one lap, and you slow up.
Everything hurts. Your legs. your chest. you
heart. they all ache; but you keep moving.
You're tired. You. you want to stop. but you
don‘t.

You run another. The pain has dulled. You
barely notice it. One foot ahead of another.
And again. Move...Moving...movement.

Second wind comes. You feel exhilerated
and light. Out here it is beautiful and it is quiet.
save for the steady panting of you rhythmic
breathing You speed up. Move. Stretch your
legs farther and farther. move them faster and
faster. Sprint. Thought is gone. Speed...and
hurt. and movement. Faster. One leg in front
of the other.'Faster and faster. you‘re ﬂying.

You. you're exhausted. You walk slowly
around the track. waiting for your heart to
stop pounding. You. you feel good. You rest.
You watch the stars. Still 'there. the
stars are always there. You. you see them. and
you know that “A“‘s never make them
brighter.

You walk back to your room. Will you
study! You?. will you? Either you will or you
won‘t. You. it's for you to start over again.
You. this time you won't get trapped. You.
you‘ll start living again. You. you can yell fuck
it to all the insignificant shit that you‘ve been
bleeding your heart away for. You. you're
going to do things. '

 

 

toollshness

To the “for:
.I would like to comment about yesterday's
' food “riot” that occurred last night in the State
Quad cafeteria. The “riot” consisted of.
banging trays. glasses. and silverware. with
one ringleader throwing his tra'y. withfood on
it, on the floor. I feel that this blatant display
of ignorance and immaturity should be put to
an end! I don't know if these students have
been to a supermarket. but food does cost
moneyl For the money we are paying, I feel
that we are the recipients of a tremendous
bargain! I would like to see the students fend
. f orthemselves. As it is. we get a large variety of
foods. all we can eat, and the meals are served
at convenient times. If these "gourmet" rioters
want lobster a bisque and baked alaska, let
them pay for it. Most students do not want to
pay another $100. and some cannot afford it.
In conclusion. I would like the students to
see the food situation from both sides (after
all. we are college students) before they revert
to infantilism.

special
delivery?

To the Editor:

Upon opening last Wednesday‘s ASP] was
quite surprised to see Tom Wallace's letter to
the Editor. which he stated was a copy of one
that had been sent to the Election
Commissioner. I understand that Mr. Wallace
seems to find it difficult to be as accurate in
print as he ought to be. but l would have
preferred to find out through him. ratherthan
the ASP, that l was to have received such a
letter.

I don‘t feel it is necessary to comment on
what Mr. Wallace wrote; the constitutionality
of the Court‘s decision has been rehashed
countless times over. But in regards to his
request that the Election Commission remove
his name from the ballot ofthe Colonial Quad
Central Council election. I would likcto make
it clear that the commission has never received

L any letter in that regard.

Fortunately for. Mr. Wallace. there .
nothing to worry about. His name will not
appear on the ballot. but only because th
Supreme Court has ruled that, because 0
campaign violations. he may not be listed as
candidate; nor will any write-in votes cast {or
him be counted. A letter from Tom Wallace
asking that his candidacv be withdrawn serves
and will not affect the running of the election
Tom Wallace‘s name cannot and will not
appear on, the ballot whether the Election

' Commission receiVes his letter or not.

no
battleships

To the Editor:

Allan Rauch's intriguing Guest Opinion
‘ AKNlN: Crazy or Not. or. the shores of
Bohemia. Revisited" was a pruiseworthy
effort at explaining a complex issue,
unfortunately. it was apparently too complex
for Mr. Rauch.

Now, one needn't harp on the need for
accuracy in analysis. but I‘d like to draw
attention to one statement the author made.
namely that the U.S. “. . . quickly dispatched
a battleship with over 5.000 Marinestottnchor
off the coast of Uganda."

Ignoring the question of how one gets lhul
many Marines on a battleship. We come tothe
more fundamental question of liming it
battleship to put them on. Since there life no
battleships currently with the fleet. it: ought
assume that Mr. Rauch means one of those
ships presently in mothbttlls. Htchwr. it
would take several months to outfit UllL' .l\
transport. so we fail to meet the ctttcttunt
being “quickly dispatched.“ don‘t “c'

Perhaps Mr. Rauch was ustng the lL'rl
"battleship" as a generic term It” \\ttf\ill[l.
possibly even one of our own. ll lilh n the
case. We have no further problem mt lt Rnttch‘s
article. except that Uganda has no scat-oust.

Undoubtedly. he meant the coast of lake
Victoria (or. perhaps he thought that “B
would attack Kenya out of frustrnttunt ()ur
valiant transport-battleship could hm. been
transported in sections by railroad llolll Dar
es Salaam to Mwanza and reconstructed on
the shores of the lake. Tanzanian smutetgtttt
notwithstanding. I can see our Nillp now.
