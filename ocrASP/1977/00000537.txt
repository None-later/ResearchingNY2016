By MARK .I. McGARRY

Gene Wolfe is a writer not many of you
will have heard of. He manages to make
Nebula Award nomination ballots with a
fair degree of frequency. and sometimes
wins. . . but he doesn't write books very
frequently, which means he will have
escaped the attentions of the general
public. Which is unfortunate, because in
terms of the sheer quality of his prose, he
is science fiction’s most talented writer.
Period. Though readers of this column
may have become jaded to my hyperbole.
take that particular statement at face
value.

And. taking it so, buy his latest book,
The Devil in a Forest (Ace, SLSO). This
was released in hardcovers last year and
was billed as a juvenile fantasy. The
United States, to the best of my
knowledge, is the only nation that
advertises books as “juveniles.” Ace. in
this fine package. has “sf“ on the spine
and blurbs it as a fantasy on the cover. It
is in no sense a juvenile.

What it is. is a Medieval adventure
inspired by “Good King Wenceslas," a
traditional carol. If Wolfe can be said to
have a fault, it is that at times be over-
estimates his readers, and the attention
and effort they are willing to devote to
him. The Devil in rt Forest is his most-
perfect book to date in that it can be fully
enjoyed on a superficial level. as an
adventure and a mystery, If one delves
deeper, it becomes a powerful
psychological statement. l would suspect
that Wolfe himself wrote the back-cover
blurbs, which call attention to the central
theme ofthc book that ofsusceptibility of
the individual to the draws of good and
evil, when neither is clear-cut or
obviously superior to the other.

But what is the book about. you might
ask. Superficinlly. it is it story set in ntiny
village in Europe which is being ruined by
the attentions of n highwuymtrn named
Wat. There is at holy spring near the
villagc which once attracted pilgrims. but
Witt robs those that approach the village,
and the villagers suffer for it. The nbbe
(that‘s priest to you) of the village
suggests that the men form a militia and
.go after Wnt. That‘s nearly us far as the
plan goes. because the night the militia is
formed. young Mark, the Weaver's
apprentice, and .losellen, his girl, go into
the woods treat the village meet with Wat.
Wat has a proposal l’orthe villagers. Heis
suffering from the lack of commerce
through the urea, and would like to move
on. If the militia will help him execute one
first robbery. he will have the finances to
set himself up in new territory, and
everyone will benefit.

What follows this is an intricate, but
well-told series of deceptions and counter
deceptions that ends with several villagers
slain, and Wat occupyingthe village with
a force of robbers. while the King's
soldiers are on the way. led by Sieur
Ganelon, the forester. Ganelon is a
mysterious figure, and when the mystery
around him is dispelled your breath will

be taken away.
Wat is no ordinary highwnymuy. He is

‘NOVEMBER 11. 1977

      

 

always someone unpredictable, and thus
someone to be feared. He is not 'wholly
evil. He is seduced by the forces of both
light and darkness. and so is Mark, his
unwilling companion throughout most of
the book. Mark resists the forces of evil,
not heroically, but by his simple nature.

It is a well-told story. Wolfe's
knowledge of Medieval life and
terminology seems to be accurate, and
certainly has the feel of reality. His prose
is simple, under-stated, poetic»~and at
times very powerful. Here is Wat‘s first
kill to be described in the book:

Under the shade of the ﬁrst big forest
chestnut he halted for a moment.
straightened up. wiped his forehead on
one sleeve, and shifted his pack' to his
other shoulder. As he took his ﬁrst step

forward. an arrow pierced his throat.

It was as though he had been struck a
blow. and he never actually knew it was
an arrow: but he saw his pack lying
alongside him in the dust. and his own red
blood on the road—and for a moment,
the peddlcr clearly saw himself as a boy
running with other boys in the streets of
Prague.

Lesser writers would shower you with
gore. Wolfe has the uncanny skill of
describing just enough, and letting your
mind imagine the rest. He creates images
by letting you create them. it is only when
you do not have this skill and self
confidence to recognite you have it, that
you must resort to the flashy pyrotechnics
that sinle and crackle and ultimately fade
from book-stores.

There are nearly a dozen major
characters in the hook, and a few minor
ones. Wolfe cluirncteri/es them all with a
single line stroke thitt is rcminescent of
Shakespeare. finch character is separate.
and whole. Attention to detail is
important here, too. l'hrough use of
detail. Wolfe makes you see what the
characters fccl. rather than describing
their emotions. let me use another
passage:

llllt‘l‘ Mar/t found it strange to .\t't‘ his
ttlt'll ’ltllltlfll‘t’l'h beside the altar iii the
chapel . . . .If/ lllt' (that the rthlte moved
through the Ill_l'.\'lt'l‘lttlt.\' gestures oft/1c
Itltl.\‘.l'. lli.\' lingers nun/t- crosses in the air.
and lit' .ipoltu in o language Mark had
been told was Intin. A slanting shaft of
sunlight found one of the plot-es where
mark hod swung his hammer too hard
and ltf/f (I depression in Illl‘ wood. He
wondered if anyone also saw it.

That is precision writing. It is lean.
accurate. and all the more effective for
that. It is as if Wolfe had to pay for each
word he used, and so chose them
carefully. And if you had to pay for each
word, you would find your money well
spent. To paraphrase. he makes you hear,
and fell. . . above all, he makes youseea—
and that kind of writing is rare enough to
make you leap for the chance to buy, and
savor, this book.

And because it would be hard tofollow
Wolfe‘s net, I will end this column short
