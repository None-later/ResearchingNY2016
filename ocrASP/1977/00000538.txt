NYPlRG‘s criticism of the validity of
ucational Testing Service examinations
ppears to be based on the assumption that
TS exams (such as the Graduate Record
xam orthe Law School Admissions Test) are
ed as the sole basis for graduate or
rofessional school admissions decisions. This
svirtually never the case. and even the most
ompetitive schools. where there are many
ore well qualiﬁed applicants than available
esitions. use ranking formulas based on both
. student‘s undergraduate grade point average
and his or her score on the appropriate ETS
exam. Other factors (such as reference letters
and evidence of unusual talent or motivation
not reﬂect in grades and test scores) also
inﬂuence admissions decisions. But even if
such considerations are ignored. the issue is
not the extent to which LSAT scores by
themselves predict law school grades (as
NYPlRG claims) but the predictive validity of

as places, Berkeley has come to base most
admissions decisions on a weighted average of
undergraduate grades and LSAT scores.

All selection criteria require drawing some
kind of line. and those who fall just belowsuch
a line will not differ signiﬁcantly from those
who are just above it. Efforts to predict future
success involve an element of uncertainty and
there are always instances of people doing
better or worse than predicted. Such turisms
do not invalidate any particular selection
procedure. Those criticile ETS exams ought
to spell out the selection criteria they would
substitute.

To rely on college grades alone is to ignore
large differences in the meaning of a given
grade at various schools. To use ETS exams
alone is to nvcremphasizc ability and skills
relative to effort and motivation. To rely
heavily on non-qualitative indices such as
reference letters. candidate's statements or
biographical data creates too much rish of
subjectivity and is impractical for large
numbers of applicants. The best compromise
is to use a numerical index based on grades
and test scores. while reserving the option of
relying on more subjective data in genuinely
unusual situations,

front of the waiting Board members and scratched his stomach. “The big
issue in front of us now is soda,” he said solemnly. “Remember, if we
stick together, not even Norb can stop us. We’re goingto bringthe price
of soda back down to 25 cents for the students!”

After the applause had died down, one of the Faithful spoke up. “You
know, when I get up in the morning and I start to go into caffeine arrest,
1 run out into the hall to grab a coke, and I have to fumble around for
that extra nickel when I’m half asleep, it’s a real pain inthe derriere.”

A murmur of agreement ran through the gathered Faithful. Then the
President cleared his throat to speak. “Last year, the Board did nothing
but worry about cans and bottles. But this year is gonna be different. The
students run this Board, and we‘re gonna show ‘em that they just can’t
mess around with students on vital issues like Mr. Pibbl”

Another rousing round of applause ensued, and two of the Faithful
were inspired to run out to the Coke machine in the hall and kick it two
times.

When they returned. one of the Outcast had taken the floor. “What
about the cost of converting'the machines?”

“A mere pittance, compared to the thousands of nickels we’ll be
saving the students,“ shouted one of the Faithful.

“Besides,” intoned the President, “I happen to know that Norb has a
three million dollar surplus stashed away, hidden somewhere in the
books. All we have to do is find it."

The Outcast stood up and began to pacethe room. “But at 25 cents the
machines will lose money, and I don’t wantto support the Coke habits of
faculty and adminstrators and off campus students with my board
checks!"

“Norb,” said the President. stroking his be-stubbled chin, “could mill!
money from trees."

Again, applause broke out, and the Faithful leapt to heir feet,joined

" But wait!" cried the Outcast. “what about the deficit, the board hike,

The Faithful. however, only chanted louder: “Fight for Sprite! Fight
for Sprite!"

The President rose from his chair, and immediately there was silence.
“Do not rejoice yet. There is still much work ahead of us. We must
hasten to prepare forthe next bigissue. . . " Herethe President paused
to ready his audience for the full impact of his words; words so feared
that for years they were spoken in the breaths of a whisper. “Next,” said

'the President. throwing his hands high over his head, “condom
