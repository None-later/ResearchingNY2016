ClNClNNA'I'l(AP)Avisittoahyp:
notist. s"sink-or-swim managerial
riiove, and‘ the power of positive
thinking have put Cincinnati Reds
slugger George Foster at baseball's
pinnacle. '

“ibis is the apex," and the 29-
year-old outﬁelder Tuesday, after
being named Most Valuable Player
of the National League, an honor
that narrowly eluded him a year ago.

Collecting l5 of a possible 24 ﬁrst
place votes, Foster outpoIled
Philadelphia‘s Greg Luzinski by 36
votes. It was the sixth time in eight
years that the award by the Baseball
Writers Association of America
went to a Cincinnati player.

Foster overcame fear of failure to
develop into ,one of the most
awesome power hitters of the
decade. His 52 homc runs, 149 runs
batted in anti 3K7 total based
destroyed club records held by a trio
of Cincinnati's greatest
hitters: 'l‘ed Kluszewski. Johnny
Bench and Frank Robinson. l’or
topping, he added a career-high .320
average.

Only four other National League
players have hit 50 or more homers.

 Put Foster At Apex

The last time it was accomplished
was l2 years ago, by San Francisco's
Willie Mays, Foster's childhood
idol.

“Going back to high school, Willie
was my hero. The big reason is, as a
kid, you relate to someone—a
black—who does something well.

 

 

 

That‘s where it started for me,” said
Foster.

Years later, his dream culminated
when he played in the same outﬁeld
with Mays and Bobby Bonds. But
his raw skills were overlooked by the
Giants, who dispatched him to the
minor leagues.
