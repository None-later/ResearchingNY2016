' Havlicek was benched for a rookie.

and higher scorer Jo Jo White

. skipped practice Thursday as the

NBA Boston Celtics, oil‘ to their
most miserable season start in
history, groped for remedies totheir
losing ways. -

The benching ' of Havlicek
sometimes known as “Mr. Basket-
ball” in Boston. and the sudden dis-
appearance of White came the day
afterthe Celts lost 129-! 14 to the San
Antonio Spurs, leaving their season
record at a very un-Celtic one win
against eight defeats.

“We were absolutely lousy,“ com-
plained Celtics coach Tom Heinsohn
after the San Antonio game.

The club announced that Cedric
“Cornbread” Maxwell. a ﬁrst-round
draft pick this year from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Charlotte.
would replace Havlicek at forward
Friday night when the Celtics play
the Buffalo Braves at the Boston
Garden.

Of White. an eight-year pro who
was voted most valuable player in
the 1976 NBA playoffs, the team said
only that he failed to show up for
Thursday’s workouts.

"He wasn‘t at practice. We don‘t
know where he is." a team
spokesman said. Has he quit? “See if
he shows up tomorrow night." said
the spokesman.

White, a guard who has been the
Celtics‘ leading scorer with more
than 17 points a game this season.
was one of several Celtics to receive
an angry tongue-lashing by club
President Red Auerbuch after the
loss to San Antonio.

Auerbach stormed into the Celts'
dressing room and shouted, among

'other things. “If any of you guys

don't feel like playing, you can pack

your bags and get the hell out of

here.“

The benched Havlicek. 37. after l5
years as a star, is Boston's steadiest
soldier. He needs only 13 points to
become the NBA‘s third highest
career scorer, eclipsing Jerry West.

Last season, when star center
Dave Cowens walked away fromthe
team and Charlie Scott was out with
an injury, Havlicek responded with
more than l7 points a game. This

‘ season. he is averaging l 1.9 per con-

test.

He was unavailable for comment.
A team spokesman said Heinsohn
ordered Havlicek benched.

“He‘ll probably be the sixth man
against Buffalo." the spokesman
said.

Garcia Pleased
With Grapplers
Eleven members of the l977-78
State University of New York at
Albany wrestling squad participated
in the Thrid Annual Springfield
Open last Saturday, and head coach
Joe Garcia was pleased with the
results.

"No team points were kept in the
unseeded tournament," he said. “and
the wrestling was done on an in-
dividual basis. It was a learning ex-
perience for the team members and I
wanted them to haVe the pre-seuson
exposure to the competition.“

It was Albany's first appearance in
the tournament, and the Danes
posted ten wins. six by pins.

Howard Berger, wrestling in the
134-pound class, recorded pins of
3:30. 3:|5 and 4:15. and one ll~6
decision before being edged 6-5. One
of Berger's pin victims was Mark
Tobin who was All-American in
1975-76.

Pete Palcovie recorded a 5:05 pin
and an 8-4 decision in the ISO-pound
competition. John Conway. l50.
posted a 1:47 fall. Rich Porter. 153.
accomplished a pin in 3215 before
losing a 3—2 decision in overtime.

For the first time in more than a
year the Danes were entered in the
llB-pound weight class. Freshmen
Steve Zucker lll'ld Marty Monin
worked in the lightweight class.
Zucker posted an impressive 16-3
win in his first taste of collegiate
competition, while Moniri lost a 12—I
decision.

Today, the Danes will participate
in the Colgate Open Tournament.

Tomorrow's Albany StateSpn' ngfield College footliall gamiindhxfim
games for which all those familiar sport cliches were made for.

You know the ones I mean. It‘s now or never, it‘s a must game. they have
their backs to the walls, a do or die situation, or any others you might think
of.
Butto put it simpler. tomorrow's game can be described in three words. b'g
Big. BIG. .

Should the Danes, who have won their last seven straight games be
Victorious tomorrow, they‘ll do something Monday that no other previous
Albany State football team has done after a season‘s ﬁnale—practice.

They'll practice for the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division
I“ playoffs. and a chance for an appearance in the Adams Alanzo Stagg
Bowl in Alabama.

Albany is currently ranked as the ninth best teamin the nation. Not bad for
a team which was only considered tenth best in the East last week. More
importantly, they are the top team eligible for a post-season bid. Their
invitation is just sitting on a table waiting to be grabbed. An Albany win will
put the invitation in Albany‘s hands.

True, the Alonzo Stagg Bowl isn't the Rose ﬂow
but it is the bowl which decides the best team in Diiigirohhilemnge BOWL

I can‘t think ofanother team which deserves it morethan t he Danes. Coach
Bob Ford has done an outstandingjob ofturning last year‘s 4-5 team into a
winning team this year.

The Danes have never been in this situation before. Rememberthey only
gained varsity status four years ago. But Albany has nlildc a name for
themselves. Just ask the University of Maine. 'l‘hcy‘re probably still in shock
after Albany upset them. The Black Bears will always look back at that game
as one they wish they had over.

But there is no looking for Albany. Everything is in front of them
now. And as long as the players and coaches know i ilill. they should continue
to keep moving forward, all the way to Alabama.

'lliree Dane defensemen are listed as
doubtful for tomorrow‘s game.
Defensive ends Steve Smith and Jim
Dignan both have leg injuries while
Ed Tranholm has a sprained ankle.

The Danes' offense. coming off
their largest output of the seasoii(47
points) will line up as they have all
year. Brad Aldrich. who has com-
pleted half of the passes he has
thrown this year will beatthe helm.

Haliston, Mike Mirabella and
Glenn Sowalskie will form the run-
ning attack which is averaging 361
yards per game.

Coach Ford feels his team must
put together a game similar to the
Norwich contest to beat Springfield.
“We can‘t afford too many mis-
takes," said Ford. “Defensively. we
have to stop LaSorsa and not let
Weller throw too many of those
short passes. They're [Springﬁeld] a
good offensive team.“ commented
Ford.
