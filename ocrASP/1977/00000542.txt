The Albany State football team
closes out its regular season against
Springfield College tomorrow in a
game which carries a possible
NCAA Division lll tournament bid
for the Danes.

The Danes. presently on a seven-
game winning streak. are ranked
ninth in Division ill and are thetop
team in the East Region eligible for
an NCAA post-season invitation.

Bob Ford. Albany‘s head coach
feels a win tomorrow would just
about guarantee an entrance ticket
to the tournament. “If we win. i
don‘t see how the selection com-
mittee can keep us out." said Ford.

But tomorrow's game'itgainst the
Division ll Chiefs may not come
easy for Albany. Springfield is rank-
ed eighth in the nation with it 7-2
record.

“They‘re a very good team.“ said
Ford. “Hell. any team with a 7-2
record against the schools they have
played has to be considered
good."Springﬁeld has played seven
other Division II teams along with
two from Division ill.

The Chiefs. offense will present
the Danes with a multiple-type
offense. Basically. they are a ground
oriented team. according to
Albany's assistant coach Jack
Siedlecki. running the ball about 80
percent of the time. But Siedlecki
was quick to point out that their
passing attack makes them quite
effective.

The key to their offenscis theirtail
back Mike LaSorsa. The four-year
player is Springfield's leading
ground gainer this year averaging 5.4
yards a pop.

LaSorsa holds all of Springfield‘s
season and career rushing records.
“He is just super quick." said
"Siedlecki. “Once he gets outside. he
is gone. He also is tenacious.“

In addition to his running
abilities. he is an excellent pass
receiver as well. averaging [2.8 yards
a reception.

The Chief's two fullbacks will also
test Albany‘s tough defense. which
has allowad an opponent only two
yards per carry. Mark Bunker and
Fred Dcutch. both seniors. comple-
ment each other very well. Banker is
a good blocker while Dcutch has
good speed.

Two weeks ago against Wagner.
Dcutch ran fora 99-yard touchdown
score. the second one this year. The
other one belongs to Albany's Sam
Haliston who pulled it off against
Norwich.

The player who runs Springfield's
offense is their quarterback. Bob
Weller. another senior. “Weller is an
excellent passer.“ said Siedlecki.
“Most of his passes are short. but he
completes a lot of them.“

Last year Weller led the nation in
pass completions with a 62 per cent
average. This year. Weller has com-
pleted just over 50 percent.

Booters’ Season Locked Breaks

by Paul Schwartz

“Sometimes you need the breaks
m 30 your way for a highly
successful season. it seems we
couldn‘t ﬁnd a break this year.“
These were the comments of Bill
Schieffelin. the Albany State varsity
soccer coach.

Making the playoffs was the
primary goal of this year‘s Albany
State varsity soccer team. a goal
which was missed by the slightest of
margins.

The Danes 8-5 record was one win
away from being selected for the
NCAA Division III playoffs. Ad-
ding to the frustration was the fact
that Cortland. one of the teams
selected for the playoffs. was beaten
by Albany during the season.

On another ironic note. the team
also lost the chance to play in the

Poli Sci Seeks Acting Chairman

by J.M. Reilly

The SUNYA Political Science
Department is looking within its
ranks for a candidate to ﬁll in as Ac-
ting Department Chairman for the
Spring '78 semester.

Graduate School of Public Affairs
Dean Orville F. Poland said that he
is consulting with department
members about a replacement for
present Department Chairman
Carlos A. Astiz. who is going on sab-
batical next semester.

“The procedure for selecting an
Acting Chairman for a single
semester is not a terribly formalized
one." said Poland. “it does not re-
quire a search committee. . . we
haven't really even thought of going
outside the University. it wouldn't
make much sense. since the position
is only open for a single semester.“

Astiz will return to SUNYA in

Fall ‘78 and resume his duties as
Chairman of the Political Science
Department..

Poland, as Dean of the School.
will recommend someone for the
position to Vice President for
Academic Affairs David Martin by
December l. Poland will make his
recommendation after consulting
with Department members “to the
extent that both i and the Depart-
ment feel is necessary.“ he said.

Poland described the process as
“extremely ﬂexible. . . if both the
Department and i feel the nomina-
tion can be made with little consulta-
tion. that’s how it‘s done. if they
want more consultation before i
make my recommendation. they'll
get it.”

Poland explained that "Although
the faculty legally are not in a posi-
tion to elect a Chairman. their views

On To The Nationals

For the first time in its young. five-year history. the Albany
State varsity football team will participate in the NCAA Divi-

Thc Great Danes. who won their eighth straight game Satur-
day. 10-7 over Springﬁeld. were one of eight teams chosen Sun-
day to compete in the prestigious tournament which begins

Albany will travel to Virginia Saturday to take on Hampdcn—
Sydney College. Both teams ﬁnished withidenticaltH records.

“ We‘re excited." was Albany‘s head coach Bob Ford‘s feeling
after learning of the bid. “it‘s a great honor to be chosen from
nearly 300 schools." Albany was also the only team out of 53 in
the East Region to be selected.

The other quarterﬁnal games show Widener (Pa) at lowa
Central. Minnesota-Morris at Albion of Michigan and Wabash-
lndiana at St. John's of Minnesota. St. John's is the only team
which participated in the NCAA's last year.

Should Albany defeat Hampden-Sydney on Saturday. their
next opponent will be the winner of the Widener-lows Central
contest to be played on November 26.

The ﬁnal two teams will meet for the NCAA Division iii
Championships in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl to be held in
Alabama on Dec. 3. St. John‘s won the championship last year
defeating Towson State ill-28.

“It should be a great tournament." said coach Ford.
"Everybody participating is of course an excellent football

are continually solicitied. . . " He
said that though he must make the
ﬁnal decision about who to recom-
mend. “it is clear that a Dean
nominates a candidate that the
Department doesn't like with great
trepidation. . . "

Poland's recommendation is then
reviewed by Martin. who in turn
makes his recommendation to Ac-
ting SUNYA President O'Leary,
who must make the ﬁnal decision.

According to Poland. the search
for the Acting Chairman is still in the
preliminary stages. and as yet no
names have been produced to be for-
mally considered for nomination.

As far as the duties of the Acting
Chairman position go. whoever
lands the job will probably be more
concerned with maintaining the
status-quo within the department
rather than making any major policy
changes.

No Changes

“An Acting Chairman is not really
in a position to make any fundamen-
tal changes within the department.
and he or she is not expected to."
Poland said. “There's no sense in
charging off in a completely new
direction when the permanent
Chairman is coming back the next
semester.“

Although Astiz agrees that an ac-
ting Chairman does not try to
remodel a department. “He or she
will have plenty to do just making
the day-to-day decisions that any
Chairman must make."

Asitr. intends to spend his sab—
batical working as a Research
Fellow at Harvard. He will be a
member of the Program on
Technology and international Af-
fairs. a joint program of the Center
for international Affairs and the
Kennedy School of Government.

Astiz was invited to spend his sab—
batical at Harvard several years ago

tion. which examines the spread of
both nuclear weapons and nuclear
power throughout the world.

Astiz had applied for sabbatical
several months ago, and he was
granted a semestcd for the 1977-78
academic year.

“i chose to take my sabbatical dur-
ing the Spring semester. so that i
would be here during the on-site
evaluation by the State Education
Department." said Astiz.

SED Review

The Political Science Department
here at SUNYA came up for SED
review in October of this year.

Since departmental morale is one
of the criteria the SED evaluators
use to make their determinations. it
was probably wise for Astiz to post-
pone his sabbatical until the Spring.
According to Dean Poland. “There
is always the possibility of putting
someone in the position who might
cause some dissension within the

department. but we will try to avoid
tit!

According to Astiz. the Depart-
ment has not received the results of
the SED evaluation. “The on-site
visitors were here in October. but
they have yet to produce their ﬁeld
report... it should come out
within the next month or so. so i
will be able to see it and respond to it
if necessary before i leave for Har-
vard."

The second phase of the evalua-
tion. the outside evaluation. will take
place sometime next semester.

This part consists of a review of
SUNYA's Political program by a
panel of noted experts in the ﬁeld.
who then make their recommen-
dations to the SED. The ﬁnal results
of the evaluation will probably not
be made known until someone late
next year. at which time Astiz should
be back in his Chair in the SUNYA
Political Science Department.

Partial CDTA Service Unlikely

by Jill Haber

The Division of the Budget
doesn‘t seem interested in the
proposal for CDTA to provide night
and weekend service on a trial basis.
according to Bus Committee
member Kim Burke.

After the last meeting of the Bus
Committee Burke said. “it wouldn‘t
serve any beneﬁt for CDTA and
wouldn't accomplish anything for
us."

According to committee member
gobert Stierer. SUNYA had receiv-
ed a telephone call from CDTA in-
dicating that they would like to dis-
'cuss the possibility of trial service.
Stierer pointed out that it letter
written by Vice President for
Businessand Finance John Hartigan
saying that SUNYA is “receptive to
discussions about limited service on
a trial basis.”

“if the trial service is within the
[SUNYA] budget I don't see how we
would be involved” said Executive
Director of the Budget Paul
Viellette. “Last I heard about the
trial proposal was John Hartigan's
letter."

Another Bus Committee member.

Jeff Scardino. said. “i wouldn't want
the University to go through what it
had to with CDTA again.“ Accor-
ding to Scardino. “CDTA has con-
ceded defeat." but they want to dis-
cover why negotiations were
stopped.

Scardino said. “i don‘t know ifsix
months can tell the story. They're
feeding us the bait. Everything could
be peaches and cream. but will they
provide the service?“

A number of complaints have
been made by students about the
Yankee Trails weekend bus service.
but whether CDTA would be better

The group was dormant during
the CDTA takeover talks. but accor-
ding to Committee Chairman Kim
Burke. no gripes about SUNYA bus
service were ﬁled during that period.

The Liaibon Committee will in-
clude students Kim Burke. Jeff Scar-
dino. and Larry Fink; Plant
Superintendent lra DeVoe. Motor
Pool Superintendent Ken Wolvin,
and bus drivers Chuck Knox and Bill
Collins.

The group is planning an open
meeting on Alumni Quad to air
grievances.
