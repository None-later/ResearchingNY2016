Five vending machines‘ for the
New York Daily News have been
placed at strategic points on the
academic podium. 4

Bringing the Daily News to
SUNYA was the brainchild of Eileen
Margolin. a transfer student from
Nassau Community College.
Margolin's father, Arnold Lewit. isa
foreman at the New York Daily
News production plant in Long
Island City.

Margolin said she was granted a
solicitations permit for vending the
newspaper on August 29. two days
before the start of classes. The ven-
ding machines were placed on the
podium on Saturday. Nov. l2. She
has enlisted the help of a number of

Speeding Cyclists
Issued Tickets

ELLENSBURG. Wash. (AP) Cars
are banned on the tidy campus of
Central Washington University, but
college police are peering into a
radar screen and planning to issue
tickets. Student bicylists are
speeding.

“We had a hit-and-run just last
,night." CWUpolice chief Adolph
Brickley said Wednesday. A 64-year-
old man suffered cuts and a bloody
nose when a bicyclist knocked him
down and then disappeared into the

darkness.

Two students have been injured in
collisions over the past two weeks.
One sustained a broken collar bone.’
Brickley said there have been
numerous bump-and-bruise ac-
cidents in the past, but the hit-and-
run forced the crackdown.

‘ The radar program. two weeks
old. is just in the "warning" stages on
the one-and-a-half square mile cam-
pus. Brickley said. but in another
week police will begin handing out
tickets.

“We want to publicize it pretty
well so there won‘t be any claims of a

trap." Brickley said.

tributing the newspaper five days a
week.
Margolin said she missed the Dai-
Iy News when she came up to
SUNYA. "The Daily News
represents downstate more than the
New York Times,“ she said. "I love it
and I thought it would be a good idea
to bring the newspaper up here.”
Journalism professor William
,Rowley said he was glad to see the.
paper on the SUNYA campus. "I’m
all for having the Daily News
because it represents more variety
and diversity on campus," he said.
“You would hope that people would
read a variety of things. In some
aspects the Daily News has some
‘darn good writers.” Rowley said.
"Variety is the spice of life and a Un-
iversity shouldn’t be too stuffy.”
English Department Chairman
John Gerber said, “I really don't
have any feeling on it one way or
another. I personally wouldn‘t buy
one because I get the New York
Times every morning.” Gerber said,

Polal Service.

The US . Department of
Agriculture reports that as a result of
serious incidents of lost and
damaged mail, the Department has
been sending some of its recent
important mailings by the privately
run United Parcel Service.

USDA staff ofﬁcer Kenneth Duff
says the Federal Agency switched
services after the post ofﬁce
managed to destroy, damage or
misdeliver about one-fifth of an
extensive survey, a survey that had
cost taxpayers Sl20.000 to compile.

SPECIAL DELIVERY

The FBI is reportedly trying to
track down and question a 29-year~
old Colorado man who has been
mailing low-grade uraniutn waste
material to hundreds of America's
power elite.

The Village Voice reports that
Leigh Huutcr has mailed the dirt-like
material along with a cover letter to
members of Congress. Governors
and leading business executives to
dramatize the hazards of a nuclear
industry.

The letter warns cuch recipient
that the dirt—like substance enclosed
is a low-grade radioactive waste
product; the letter invites them, if
they doubt the warning. to check it

 

out with their own'Gei‘gercounters. ‘

Hauler's‘letter also stresses that
the material was not stolen from a
guarded atomic site. He says he
gathered the waste in public areas.

' lying along streams. on public roads

and in fields near where uranium
mining and processing are taking
place.

The letter adds. in its words. “You
havejust come in contact with radia-
tion. There is no practical means for
limiting access to this material...it is
a necessary by-product of the
nuclear industry.“

While the FBI has been attemp-
ting to reach Hauter. he told the
Voice by telephone from Colorado
that he has not gone underground.
He stated: “I just thought this would
be a great time to visit a lot of my
friends who happen to live in the
remote sections of the Rocky Moun-
tain region.“

FINE WINE

High Times magazine is offering
$20,000 in reward money to anyone

GIFT IDEA

Watch out, Nieman-Marcus. All
other gift catalogs of the past have
usually been outclassedm by the
Texas-based Nieman-Marciis store
for weird or wonderful gadgets.

However. this year. another Texas
department store. Sakowitz. takes
the prize with the ultimate gift: It's

offering a six seated hovercraftI

called “Diskojet.” which is shaped
like a ﬂying saucer.

Diskojet, says the Texas com-
pany. will take you spinning through
the air at a speedy 325 miles per
hour. and is "perfect for traveling
argund large ranches." The full-sized
six seater saucer costs a mere SI.
l25.000,though economy models
rare available for the cheap—at-heart.

“it makes Nieman-Marcus’s
$300 mink sling look a little tacky by
comparison.

DON'T FORGET

If you can‘t remember what it was
you had for lunch. it may be you ate
too much baloney or too many hot
dogs.

A research team at the University
of California at Irvine is reporting
that “sodium nitrite,“ a chemical

  

widely wed in meats cafe pinea-
vative. producee‘ainneeia in rate

D’r? Joel Martinez. 
Reeeerch' Biologin. says his' study“
raises significant queitioaa 
chemiegl'geffect on humans..

The doctor reports that . two
groups of rats were trained not to go
along certain paths in a maze
because of the risk of electric shocks.
One group was then given nothing,
while a second group was given low
doses of sodium nitrite.

Dr. Martinez says that while 50
percent of the normal group
remembered how to avoid the
shocks. only 20 percent of those
given sodium nitrite were able to do
S0.

Sodium nitrite. which is common-
ly found in red-colored sandwich
meats. is also suspectedof being a
cancer—causing agent.

JUST DESSERTS

Yippic pie thrower Aron Kay. was
in San Francisco last Sunday.
addressing a large gathering at a
marijuana smoke-in, when he was
victimized by what was described as
an "organic lemon pie" in the face.

Kay, who has previously pied the
likes of E. Howard Hunt. William F.
Buckley. and former New York
Mayor Abraham Beame. was
philosophical about being on the
receiving end for a change. Said Kay
immediately afterwards: “All pie
throwers have to undergo ‘Pie
Therapy' to know what it's like to be
hit by a pie themselves."

Just two days earlier, Kay had

Washi ngton investigative W
Tad Szulc (pronounced “Schulz'l i! _
claiming that the “overriding ' '
reason" the Carter administration .
decided not to promote former CIK
Director Richard Helms is thlt ~.
Caner feared a public trial would ' '
reveal still-secret CIA ties to most of
America‘s largest banks.
Szulc, writing in the first issue of a
new magazine called Inquiry, alleges
that tr trial of Helms would probably

have disclosed extensive connections ‘ » r

between CIA covert activities
abroad and US ﬁnancial institutions
operating around the world.

Helms was permitted last week to
plead “no contest“ to two
misdemeanor counts stemming from
misleading testimony he gave before
a Senate Committee four years ago.
He was fined and placed on
probation.

According to Szulc. “The age of
CIA agents carrying suitcases full of
money from country to country is
gone. It has been replaced.” he says.
“by highly sophisticated banking
methods under which funds move
around the world. rinvisibly and
untraceably."

Szulc quotes one reliable source as
telling him: “You will find that every
major. and lots of minor, American
banks have been involved as CIA
channels.“

To keep'this alleged CIA banking
connection a secret, Szulc says. that
the Carter administration made a
deal: Helms agreed to keep quiet; in
return he was merely placed on
probation and avoided a possible
prison term.
