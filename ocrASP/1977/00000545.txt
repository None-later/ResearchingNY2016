’n‘llaarwguunfill'I:Dblrlt-ll‘ntllfeddI-all-f

By JOE MeGOWEN

I called home the other day and found
out Biff had died, and it seems as if part of
my youth has passed with him. The death
of a close friend inevitably leads to
reﬂections on the times that were shared
and Biff deﬁnitely qualiﬁed as a close
friend.

I remember the cold gray December
day when Biff arrived. My parents had
just returned from a funeral on Long
Island and my mother asked my brother
Bill to clean out the car. Bill grudgineg
obeyed and returned in a few minutes
with old sweatshirts, gum wrappers.
lollypop sticks, and other memorable
that haunt the rear seats of a station
wagon inhabited by seven boys. My
mother watched him closely and asked if
there wasn‘t something else in the car.
“Oh yeah," Bill replied, "There‘s a little
puppy in the back seat but [didn't know
who's he was so I left him there.“

And so iff became one of the boys.

He fit right in. Within a couple of
weeks, he had mastered the art of
climbing stairs and soon Biff was poking
that wet brown nose into all corners ofthc
house. No longer could our mother
preach to us about the starving people in
the world when we didn’t clean our plates
because we would innocently reply we
were saving something for Biff.

In spring and summer, Biff
accompanied us on our heroic
expeditions to “the woods“, an
undeveloped area of land surrounding a
nearby golf course. There we engaged in
the all-American activities that are a part
of most boy‘s youth: we made treehouses
and forts, played army and made bows
and arrows out of young mimosa trees
and twine.

Biff, being a bassett hound, would be
more than adequate as a guide dog and a
hunter. So we thought.

Biff never mastered the hunting role
though we tried at it again and again.
When a rabbit would cross our path Biff
would stare intently at it, as if his
penetrating gaze would strike down his
victim. Only after the rabbit was long
gone, and our interests had returned to
the strategic planning of our next attack,
would Biff respond. Then off he would go
barking and howling through the brush in
the direction where the rabbit
disappeared. He never caught a rabbit but
he succeeded in giving our position away
and foiling our attacks on those forts.

 
   
 
 

 
    
 

    
 
 
 
   
   
   

  

  

 
     
  

Maybe he was a double agent.

Throughout the long summers we
hawked golf balls and sold soda and
lemonade by the IOth green. We were
convinced we could do a much brisker
business if we could add beer to our
inventory but Mom and Dad
disapproved of our capitalist expansion.
The lady golfers would remark on how
cute we were and what a nice dog we had.
The men would try to pick up a few balls a
a cheap price and try and convince usthey
could take their business elsewhere. We
told them to go ahead and then they‘d
reconsider and buy those balls we pulled
out of the creek for ﬁfty cents or a
quarter. They went away happy with new
balls and we were rich: :1 perfect example
of the wonders of the marketplace.

Yet no golfer, male or female, seemed
to appreciate us when one of their shots,
as it ambled towards the green, was
intercepted by a brown and white bassctt
hound that snatched the ball into his
mouth and proceeded to guard it like a

prized possession. We lost quite a few
sales because of Bifl‘s taste for golf balls
and we all wished we could somehow
make Biff think that golf balls were
rabbits. and rabbits were golf balls.

In the winter, if snow was on the
ground, we would rush home from
school, grab our sleds, and Biff. and head
off to the golfcoursc for sleigh riding. Biff
would never ride but he would chase us all
the way down the hill and when heﬁnally
reached us we would just be starting to
trudge back up the bill. He was a joy to
watch in new-fallen snow of any
significant accumulation. He was built
quite low to the ground and in the snow
he would no longer run, he would hurdle
his way to his destination.

The memories linger on. I still see Biff
on the beach staring at a crab, brimming
with curiosity but refusing to come near
those menacing claws. I remember the
times I would throw out stale bread into
the yard for birds to eat only to glance out
the window minutes later and see Biff

 
 

devouring it. He wouldn't touch that stuff
in the house. but he knew he was our pet
and he jealously wanted to keep it that
way. To befriend another animal was to
insult Biff.

Biff seemed to think he was a family
member with the same rights as everyone
else. On many occasions we would come
home and find a dog overjoyed to see us
and a coach full of dog hair. He could
never learn that he wasn't allowed on the
couch, or far more likely. he had no
desire to.

Growing up amidst seven boys is quite
an experience. Our house usually bustled
with activity and sometimes one could
feel lost in the shufﬂe. Biff would always
bethere then, someone to share time with,
to run fingers through his coat. to know
that here was someone that was glad to be
with you and asked for no morethan a pat
on the head for his companionship. These
are the times that I, and I know my
brothers, will miss most. That eighth boy
with the funny name and the howling
