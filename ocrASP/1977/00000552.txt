Danes Holt Five Late Chief Drives;
1 Visit Virginia In NCAA First Round

by Fairlie Emerman
The Albany State varsity football

team, putting on an outstanding\

defensive effort. defeated
Springﬁeld College l0-7 Saturday,
giving the team its eight straight win
and an invitation to the NCAA Divi-
sion lll playoffs.

“lt was just the type of game I
thought it would be,” said Albany‘s
head coach Robert Ford,
“Springfield is a good 7-2 [now 7-3]
Division II football team. I knew
they wouldn‘t roll overdead forus."

And roll over they didn't. Seven
times in the second half. including
ﬁve in the ﬁnal quarter, the Chiefs
marched into‘ Albany territory.
However. the Dane defense, which

  
   

did so again on Saturddy. All of
Springﬁeld's seven scoring threats
were stopped.

The Chiefs took a 7-0 lead early in
the ﬁrst quarter. With Albany on
their own 46-yard line, quarterback
Brad Aldrich and running back Sam
Haliston botched a handoff resulting
in a fumble which Springfield
recovered.

Closed the Gap

After marching to Albany's 2f.
Springﬁeld quarterback Bob Weller
lofted a pass to JonCherry who
caught it for a 21-yard touchdown.
Albany closed the gap 7-3 later in the
ﬁrst quarter when Larry Leibowitz
kicked his eighth ﬁeld goal of the
season, a 23-yarder.

That's how the score remained un-

su .

   

til the third quarter. The Danes had
an excellent chance for another score
late in the first half as they drove to
the Springfield ten. However,
Leibowitz's 27-yard ﬁeld goal
attempt with I] seconds left was
wide to the right.

That drive saw Aldrich lead his
team from their own 17-yard line 73
yards in only 40 seconds. A 34-yard
pass from halfback Tony Moschella
to Ed Sellers and a 39-yard pass
from Aldrich to Bill Ziemann moved
the Danes downﬁeld in a hurry.

In the third quarter, the Chiefs
marched downﬁeld from their own
39-yard line to the Albany four. 0n

AllﬂA Grid Championship Finally Decided

by Rich Sellpon

“This was like a marathon." said a
spectator at Saturday's A.M.I.A.
flag football championship game.

It took two games(they played to
a 6-6 tie two weeks ago). including
three sudden death ovcrtimes. but
eventually the Perverts escaped with

a 12-6 victory, and the League II title.

Stunned because they thought vie-

Spikers Capture Final
Pair Of Home Matches

by Marcl Sllvermets

The Albany State women‘s
volleyball team won their ﬁnal two
home matches of the season on
Thursday over Orange CC. and
Columbia-Greene C.C.

Against Orange CO. the women
pounded excellent spikes. These
were set up by the ﬁne passing of
Thornasa Dwyer and Allison Deals.

Karen O'Reilly and Judy
Leikkonen. who is the squad's only
senior. played extremely Well for
Albany. Other valuable con-

tributions were put in by Mary

Coulehan and Anne Corberry.

In the Columbia Greene C.C.
match, the spikers continued their
steady performing. Spikes by Jane
Lacey and Marci Silverrnetz were a
vital part of the win.

The powerful serving of Carolyn
Devino was also a big factor in the
Danes' ﬁfteenth victory.

Spiker Judy Treadbury was un-
able to play in both matches due to
an injury.

match of the season.

ing ﬁfty yards in thirty seconds.

But Gammon‘s defensive unit
weakened, and two short aerials
from the Pcrverts quarterback. and
missed ﬂags by Gammon. enabled
the would-be champs to tie the score.

The touchdown pass of 25 yards
came with only ﬁve seconds left. and
the entire Gammon squad was
shellshocked. Offensive lineman
Mark Morris shook his head in dis-
belief. “With ﬁve seconds left. and
only one ﬂag to pull." he said.

A Pervert‘s player quipped on the
sidelines, “This was a boring game.
we set it up like this." Boring it
wasn't, but physical it was. "Brutal."
said Gammon‘s defensive lineman
Jack Mcnz. “That‘s how I can
describe every time we played these

guys—just brutal."

Luckily for Gammon tnc
attempted extra point was booted to
the left. so the battle went into over-
time.

It would have been atypical of
these evenly matched clubs for the
game to bedecided in the ﬁrstOT, so
it took two. The Perverts attained
good ﬁeld position on Gainmon‘sse-

deflect the pass, then intercept it.

Giving the Danes an emotional
lift. Aldrich took his team 80 yardsin
l3 plays for the winning touchdown.
The key plays in the drive were a 2+
yard romp by runningback Glenn
Sowalskie and a 17-yard carry by
Haliston.

As the Danes got near
Springﬁeld's endzone, the Chief
defense began getting tougher. Fac-
ed with a fourth down and goal from
Springﬁeld four. coach Ford elected
to go for the touchdown rather than
the three points.

The play made Ford look like a
genius. Aldrich handed off to
Sowalskie who then ﬂipped the ball
into the endzone and the awaiting
hands of Sellers. Lcibowitr. added
the PAT and Albany led 10-7 with
four minutes left in thethird period.

At this point. one might expect the
Danes to have the momentum in
their favor. however this was not the
case.

For the remainder of the game, it
was a matter of the Chief‘s offense
versus the Dane‘s defense.

Springfield marched to the
Albany 46 two times, only to have to
turn the ball over to Albany via

cond overtime kickoff. On ﬁrst
down. halfback John DiRocco sped
his way for a long gain. There also
was a personal fotrl penalty against
Gammon on the play. which dug
their hole even deeper.

And then a 3-yard. second-down
burst by Jim Fritts. who went in vir-
tually untouched, provided tltc win-
ning margin.

However. it appeared in regula-
tion play, the Gammon players
would be wearing the coveted AMIA
Championship T-Shirt.

After co-eaptarn Sandgrund's TD,
the Perverts wasted no time, asthere
was only l:04 left. They went to the
passing game. but it resulted in a div-
ing interception by cornerback Lett-
ny Singer.

Singer. who played solid defense
throughout. appeared to seal the vie-
tory for Gammon. But Gammon‘s
offe rise. quarterbacked by Co-
Captain Tom Stanchek, was unable
to run out the clock. They were forc-
ed to punt, as missed snaps and
laterals plagued them.

This gave the Perverts one more
chance—the one they used so well

prevailed.

Albany's offense did nothing to
help their own cause. They only
made one ﬁrst down in the entire
fourth quarter and lost a fumble on
their own 43-yard line.

Springfield. however, kept
marching on. The Chiefs got to the
Albany 25 before Ray Guy came up
with the Danes second interception
in their own endzone.

The Danes took over and moved
to their own 43 before Aldrich and
Haliston got crossed up again
resulting in another fumble. which
was recovered by Springﬁeld.

With less than two minutes to play
in the game. the Chiefs got to
Albany‘s I4—yard line but were faced
with a fourth-and-ﬁvc. Springﬁeld
decided to go for the win ratherthan
the tie. The Albany defense. sensing
a pass play called a blitz. as they had
all day. The play worked for Albany
linebacker John Veruto and tackle
Chuck Hoke broke through
Springﬁeld‘s front line and sacked

Albany ran out the remaining one

straight game. but the best was still
to come. Later that night. the team

Women’s Sports: A Struggle For Recognition

By Jill IIaber

Women's athletics at SUNYA are
not as well ftrrtdcd nor publicircd as
mcn‘s sports and women‘s athletics
at SUNYA arc disgruntled about it.

Although the section of the
SUNYA affirmative action report
dealing with sports maintains that
\vomcns intcrcolligiatc sports have
compurtrblc facilities. equipment.
and supplies. to men‘s sports. the
report recommends that publiciton
women‘s sports be increased. and ac-
cordirtg to tennis team players Jane
Malloy and listt l)cnncnrnark irr-
ctcnscd press could lead to more in-
tolvcmcnt of women in sports.

IIrc statistics in the report show
that womcn sports are funded less
than men‘s because student interest
rs lower than for the men's teams.

Along with lack of publicity.
womcu cited traditional attitudes
rrgrriust women in sports and thc
rrcrrdcmrc emphasis of SUNYA as
hampering women‘s participation
on rntcrcollcgcrrtc teams.

HEC May Probe Motel Manes

by Thomas Martello

The State Assembly‘s Higher
Education Committee is considering
an investigation into problems at the
Country Squire Motel. according to
SA legal representatives Jack Lester
and Sanford Roscnblum.

Key questions might be raised in
such an investigation about charges
by students that the ntotcl breached
housing contracts. and about possi-
ble negligence on the part of
SUNYA in dealing with problems
there.

SIJNYA'S role to the Country
Squirc situation has comc rtndcr
scrutiny by both Lester and
Roscnhlum.

“ I he University‘s positron has
been ortc of no legal inrolvcrttcnl."
said |.cslcr. “ I Irc University has an
obligation to Its students to provide
a sound academic environment. Irt
the case of this motel. tltcrc‘s cause
for involvement to rtrcct that obliga-
lion."

Roscnblum charged SUN YA with
being negligent in initrally obtarning
the housing agreement with the
ruotcl and in encouraging students to
live there.

Chairperson of Physical Education
Iidith Cobanc. “But you can't force
attendance at sports events. you cart
offer it. The tradition for male times
is a strong one. It's a little difficult to
move in."

(‘obanc noted that while par-
ticiprrtion in intercollegiate sports is
disproportionate. participation In
physical education classes is about

Women‘s athletics at SUNYA lack the publlclty and loading that man's
sports receive. The Attlrmatlve Action report recommends that
publicity of women's sports. such as tennis. be Increased.

“It seems to me the University
went outside of their ordinary role
[in providing housing]." said
Rosenblum. “And they were
negligent in doing that."

SUNYA came to an agreement
with the Country Squire Motel in
the middle of the summer after it
became apparent that the number of
students requesting on-crrmpus
housing exceeded the space
rrvtriltrblc.

No contract between SUNYA and
the motel was signed. according to
Director of Housing John Welty.
\Vclty said that to have gone ittto a
contract with tltc rnotcl would have
been at time consuming process. and
that in its place an agreement was
reached with the motel manager. lid-
dic Unscr. Some of tire stipulations
of lite agreement included that the
motel dcvclop rr sample contract for
students and that SUNYA officials
be satisﬁed with tile facilities." said
Welty.

“Ihc expectation was that they
would meet tltc terms ofth corr-
trrrcts with students.“ said Welty.

The Country Squire Motel was
chosen by SUNYA after otltcr urea

and the Women‘s Intramural and

According to tire report. since eight
of tltc intramural sports are offered
as men's. women‘s and coed team.
they should not be offered as coed
sports to meet the requirement ol'l'i-
tlc ll.

According to the report. the eight
non-contact Intramural sports
should be offered only us coed ac-
tivitics. I’rcscntly. they are offered
separately as men‘s, women's and
cocd.

Accordrrtg to Reagan. there is
already overlapping in the in-
tramural teams. and that men can
play on women‘s non-contact lcttlns
and vice vcrsu if they wish.

Reagan added that she felt that if
WIRA and AMIA combined.
\vomcn might be left out ot teams
and of management artd that fun-
drug from SA might hcdiminishcd.

motels had been checked into. said
Welty.

"We were approached by the
owners of the motel after it became
apparent that we were over-
crowded.“ said Welty. “The Country
Squire was the only motel to agree to
follow through and provide housing.
Frankly. the pieces of the other
motels were prohibitive." Welly
would not say which other motels
were looked into by SUNYA.

Motel manager Ed Unscr also
agreed to provide transportation to
the uptown campus for students. a
service which consists of eleven runs
rt day. “ Essentially. Ed Unscr agreed
to provide the service." said Welty.

Welty added that SUN YA was not
ill rt position to provide bus service

and therefore the motel made the
agreement. This transportation ser-
vice has been met with much
criticism by students.

Currently, fourteen students have
refused to pay their contracts at the
motel. while several other have mov-
cd orrt of tltc motel after paying their
bills. According to Lester. a number
of students are contemplating law-
suit against the motel.

Lester added that an attorney for
Unscr has said the university should
be held responsible for the non-
payment of students.

Welty said that SUNYA will not
assume any ﬁnancial responsibility
for the students who have not paid
their bills. “The University does not
assume ﬁnancial responsibility for
any debts that students have." said
Welty.

A number ol'students at the motel
were unable to pay their bills at the
beginning of the semester because
they were awaiting financial aid
checks.

In these cases the motel was told
of the students‘ financrrrl srtuatron
and warned that tltc motel would not

“A procedure was worked out that
full payment would be received by
the motel whcrt the applications
came through." said Welty. “We told
tltc motel that we would advise them
when the financial awards were
rcccrvcd by the University."
