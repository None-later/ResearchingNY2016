The SUNYA library will begin a
new book delivery service which

members with ofﬁces on the
Academic l’odium on Dec. |. accor-
ding to Director of Library Services
.laincs Schmidt.

“We tltink it will make l""§
easier.“ said Schmidt. "A service
similar to this one liiis been provided
at some other major universities in
the eotintry including Berkeley.
Syracuse and Ohio State.“ Schmidt
said that in three and ti littlf y'itrs,
the usage at Berkeley increased from
6.000 items to 24.000 items in two
years.

'I lie SCHlCL‘ ltas met with a degree
of opposition among some faculty
members. Ihe main complaint was
that the service wottld drain funds

conceivably direct them in more
useful ways.“ He also said. “I‘m not
in favor of it.“

Political Science Professor Ber-
nttrd Johnpoll said, “We haven‘t
even got enough money to pay the
staff in the library now and this is
just pandering. Any college
professor worth his weight wotild go
to the library anyway to examine
other materials also."

“We have have a budget line for
mail and messenger service for some
in time.“ said Schmidt. “1 don't see
the service costing as anything we
don't already have." Schmidt also
said that the service will be subjected
to continous review to determine
how many people will use it and how
many items will be delivered.

“It could be that the architecture

Schmidt said."l have e\ cry reason to
