The responsibility of publicity for
intercollegiate teams lies partly on
the shoulders of the SUNYA Office
ol‘CommUnity Relations. According
to Director Robert Rice. "We‘re not
going especially after anybody."

Rice said the ofﬁce depends heavi-
ly on staff and coaches to provide
them with information. The local
newspapers. he said. are not as in-
terested in wornen‘s sports. and that
the office considers itself infor-
rnrttional.

“We don't consider it otir duty to
sell tickets. but obviously promotion
enters into it."

“Ila group is not participating for

participated should be able to."
The lack of press has been judged
so important a problem that several
women on campus have asked SA to
fund a new tabloid newsletter about
women‘s sports. lesser publicized
men‘s sports. and recreational
events.

“Basically we believe that
women‘s sports aren't covered as
they need to be." said Anne
Markowitr. “it would supplement
ASP. Coverage just isn't coming
from the ASP."

"I wrote for the ASP for three
years and I found I was covering all
the women‘s sports." said Christine
Bellini. another organircr of the
proposed newsletter. “We got more
advertising and had less space with
the same amount [of sports] to
cover. A lot of people have con-
sidcrcd writing for ASP and have
not been able to work it out. l have
about 30 people who are willing to
work on the staff. I would appreciate
working with a system that's already
established. Editorial policy makes it
difficult. Women's sports get cut
before men's because society has
bred in that men‘s sprots are more
important."

 

The Title IX reports states that
women‘s sports are inadequately
covered in the ASP.

“I think the problem is lack of in-
tcrcst ill writing sports." said Sports
Editor Eddie Emmcrman. “I‘ve ask-
ed the head of the journalism
program to mention it to his classes.
l‘vc asked the physical education in-
structors to say it in their classes. l‘vc
advertised in the ASP. l have asked
some guys. but somehow their pride
would he hurt. They've told rne they
don't want to cover women's sports.
1 don't think they’ve [women‘s
sports] have really been slighted. If
the girls don‘t write big stones. i
can't do anything about it."

The SUNYA library will begin it
new book delivery service which
will be available to all faculty
members with offices on the
Academic Podium on Dec. l. accor-
ding to Director of Library Services
James Schmidt.

“We think it will make access
ca 'cr.“ said Schmidt. “A servrce
similar to this one has been provided
at some other major universities in
the country including llcrkeley.
Syracuse and (ihio State.“ Schmidt
said that in three and a half years.
lhc usage at llcrkelcy increased from
6.000 rtcirrs to 24.000 itcms iii two
years.

lhc scriicc has met with it degree
of opposition among some l'acully‘
mcnibcrs. lhc main complaint was
that the \Cl'HCL' would drain l'unds
lrorn ilrc :ilrcady dcplctcd library

conceivably direct them in more
useful ways." He also said. “l‘m not
in favor of it.“

Political Science Professor Ber-
nard .lohnpoll said. “We haven‘t
even got enough money to pay the
staff in the library now and this is
just pandering. Any college
professor worth his weight would go
to the library anyway to examine
other materials also.“

"We have have a btidgci line for
riiail and messenger service for some
in time.“ said Schmidt. “I dort‘t see
the service costing us anything we
don‘t already have.“ Schmidt also
said that the service will be subjected
to continous review to determine
how many people will use it and how
many itcriis will be delivered.

"It cotild be that the architecture
ol the podium is enough so that the
sct'\iL‘c won’t be necessary." he said.
Schmidt said."l haiccxcry reason to

“The delivery of books is the last
thingthat should be ofpriority.“sriid
Friedman.

Friedman also raised the possibili-
that the service might have been
proposed at this time because
Schmidt is currently up for reevalua-
tion. “I suspect it was timed perfectly
for his evaluation.“ said Friedman.

“Schmidt is using a typical gim-
mick that the administration on this
campus use." said .lohnpoll. “When
you have nothing to offer. you have
to resort to this nonsense."

Friedman pointed out that ol' the
