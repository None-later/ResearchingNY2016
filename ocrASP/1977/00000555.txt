The quality of academic advise-
ment at SUNYA. and the possibility
of supplementing academic advisors
with student advisors is being in:
vestigated by a Task Force‘ on
Academic Advisement created by
SA Vice President Kathy Baron.

“What we want to do is investigate
the existing academic advisement on
all levels, departmental and Univer-
sity College. which is now called the
Center for Undergraduate Educa-
tion. and see if there are any changes
that can be made to beneﬁt it." said
Baron.

The task force is gathering
student's viewpoints through a sur-
vey and is obtaining the viewpoints
of all academic advisors tthgh in—
terviews. In addition. the task force
is calling other universities with
comparable budgets to see liowthcir
advisement compares with SUNYA
and is also doing a general inquiry
into the advisement services of Ull-
i\'ersity College.

According to Baron. the main
problem with academic advisement
seems to be the lack ofcoordination
between the university and the
academic departments. Often a stu-
dent has several advisors during his
four years at SUNYA.

Many departmental advisors are
uninformed about university
procedures. and other departmental
procedures. There also seems to be a
lack of career counseling besides that
offered to pro-medical and pre-law
students, said Baron.

Presently. the task force is
emphasiring the possibility of

“ supplementing academic advisors

'with student advisors located in each
department.

“According to Director of Ad-
‘niissions Rodney llart, ad-
ministrators have "Realiletl
academic advisement needs im-

provement and we have worked to
change the focus of advisement.”

According to Hart, the ad-
ministration is focusing on a better
liaison between faculty members and
the administration. He said that
students need advisers not only to
sign their pre<registration card, but
to sit down with them and discuss
their courses and goals.

Students could be effective in this
position because they probably have
more insight into what each in-
dividual student wants. and they
could be more blunt about what
courses are good which faculty
couldn‘t do because they would be
talking about their colleagues. said
Baron. *

"I‘m not sure if it would be best to
try to improve the knowledge the
faculty has of the university for
better advisement or if it would be
better to supplement that advise—
ment with students who can alleviate
the pressure on the faculty." said
Baron.

The task force is interviewing the
departmental advisers to discern ex-
actly how they feel about their time
spent on advisement. according to
Baron.

The student survey is very impor-
tanttothetaskforcebecauscit will
m whether a majority of students
Ire ﬁnding their present advisement
inadequate. what changes students
would like to see implemented. and
whether they would utilize the ser-
vices of student advisers.

The task force also hopes to deter-
mine from the survey exactly what
students expect from theirttdvisors.

Budget cuts at the Center for Un-
dergraduate Education have caused
it to reduce itsadvisement services to

transfer students to departmental
advisors in their sophomore year iii-

stead of the traditional practice of
transferring advisement to the
departments in the junior year.

This year the name of the center
was changed from University
College to CUE. the number of ad-
visors was cut to six professional,
and three graduate students. and the
CUE now is utilizing a system of
group advisement to save time.

Advisors at the CUE are available
individually for advisement. but the
major emphasis is on group advise-
ment.

Martin Hcrlands. an advisor at

the CUE said.“Given the number of ._ '.

personnel. the time we have during
pro-registration. and the number of
students we have to serve. group ad-
visement seems to‘be the best
methodology we can use. Students.
seem to be getting the services
desired. We think there could be
better service. but given our
limitations, this is the best we
can do."

Students Save Drunk From Fire

by Denise Lenei

Wellington Hotel was treated at

a car threatened by ﬂames.

Paul Chin was treated and releas-

parked near the hotel. The than was
apparently drunk.

According to Chin and other
students involved in the incident. the
unidentified man was trying to get his
car off an ice patch by holding down
the car‘saceelerator. l'lie man held
the accelerator for 45 mintiles'
straight. according to the students.
until one ol his rear tires fell off and

sparks from the rim set it on ﬁre.

Bob Seiey. another student in-
volved. said he and some friends had
heard the screeching tires from their
rooms and smelled the rubber as it
began to smoke. They reported the
incident to the hotel desk and then
went outside to talk to the man.
Seley sttid.

"We tried to talk him out of it. but
he wouldn‘t stop.“ Selcy said. As the
man continued to accelerate. one of
the back tires fell off.

“Sparks ﬂew out 5 or 6 feet. Then
the tire caught on ﬁre.“ Seley said.

(.‘hiii. who had gone to phone
police on an emergency call box.
returned and tried to remove the
man before the burning tire spread

to the car. But the man clung to the
wheel. and started swinging at Chin
as he was dragged away from the car.

Firemen and Police arrived short-
ly afterwards. according to Seley.
They soaked the car with water. then
took the car owner away while Chin
was taken to the hospital.
