A’SU’NYA ' insurers who has
been involved in a sent‘est r'. long but-

. tie with Uni rsity Police says that

two . parking ,tickets he has been
issued are illegal. V

Mike McDarby says a ticket he
was issued September 27 for parking
on the crossing road between State
Quad and the southern corner of the
podium was cancelled after he claim-
ed that the road was not marked as a
no-parking zone.

When McDarby received a second
ticket for parking in the same area.
however. his appeal was not granted.
University Police have informed him
that his ﬁrst appeal was granted. and
the second one denied. because when
he started the year as a freshman he
was not familiar with parking rules
at SUNYA. The ﬁrst ticket should
have made him familiar with those
rules. they contend. _

McDarby has insisted that since
the area was still unmarked. if one
ticket was marked invalid the other
should be too.

University Police have told Mc-
Darby that regulations handed out
when cars are registered on campus
show which areas are available for
parking and which are not. he said.
McDarby said he was told that
posting signs is unnecessary.

McDarby said he was not aware
that cars had to be registered on

7' campus; His car isinot registered

with the University Police. he said.

McDarby said he also feels the
absense of no-parking signs unfairly
subjects visitors to parking tickets.

After researching the question.

McDarby said. he found a New York
State Trafﬁc Law stating that “No
ordinance, order. rule. or regulation
made by any local authority under
the powers conferred by this title
shall be effective intil signs or
markings giving notice thereof are
posted. . .” ' - A ‘

McDarby said when he showed
this law to University Police Direc-
tor Jim Williams he was told to
speak to SUNY Attorney Thomas
Winﬁeld.

McDarby said that Winﬁeld told
him that as far as he knew, without
researchingthe matter. the lawseem-
ed clearly to conﬁrm McDarby‘s
position.

Winﬁeld does not agree. “The
N.Y.S. Vehicle and Trafﬁc Lawdoes
apply to university campuses.“ said
Winﬁeld. “i don't recall giving him
any opinion that the University was
wrong.”

McDarby then said that Winﬁeld
referred him to Vice President for
University Affairs John Hartiyn. “i
can't give him any legal advice

ayirist the University." Winﬁeld said
“That's whylreferred himto Mr. Ha
ﬂtigan."

McDarby said he met with liar-
tipn and Williams and the result of
this meeting’ was that Williams cited
Education Law 362 as granting the
University Police the right of non-
compliance with the N.Y.S. Vehicle
and Trafﬁc laws. McDarby saidthat
after checking into the SUNYA law
library. he believes that the law has
no bearing in the matter.

“McDarby and Williams had a
difference of opinion in terms of
facts.” said Hartigan. “As far as the
student is concerned. I listened
attentively to what he said but l'm
not in a position to comment.“

Hartigan also said. "i think he‘s
making a crusade out of something
he feels is important. and I give
him credit for that.“

According to McDarby. when he
went to the University Police Ofﬁce
to pay a towing charge on his car.
Williams informed him that Section
362 of the Education Law was new
and might not be in the books. Mc-
Darby had rescarcbed yet.

On Nov. 5. McDarby noticed that
signs had gone up in the area he had
brought to Hartigan‘s attention. He

ding to Saks. the size of the
newspaper is generally determined
by the amount of advertisements.
most of which tend to come for
Wednesday‘s paper rather than
Monday's or Friday's edition.

In an attempt to decrease the
deficit bordering The Statesman, the
editors are issuing new jobs to
students. including printingjobs. The
staff has also agreed to a depletionin
travel eiipenses. telephone expenses.
and various other expenses which
are major causes of the deficit.

Saks stated that rather than

would prcfcr that the newspaper
become independent by funding
