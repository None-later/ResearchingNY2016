Dear Mr. Chrisman: ‘ V
_ 'I was very glad to see'your article
“The Case for the Independence of
Puerto Rico" (The Black Scholar.

" Volume 9. Number 2. October. I977)»

Not only for what it represents in
* terms of theistruggle of the Puerto

Rican people. but also for what it

represents-to the Black people.

' It is a fact that the ruling class in
this 'country has tried—in many
cases'with a great deal of success—’to
pit Blacks and Puerto Ricans against
each other. This. in many cases. is
due to the lack of understanding of
our mutual struggle as oppressed
people: in others because of oppor-
tunism. power play and confusion.
regarding our mutual goals. This
was the case in many of the so-called
"poverty programs.“

Your article represents. for us. a
new avenue of understanding that
must be cultivated; especially at this
historical moment when the US. is
moving to the right and our
achievements are at stake.

This offensive against us. especial-
ly in the area of education. can he
clearly seen in the attacks against Af-
ﬁrmative Action and against the
ethnic studies in the universities.

At this moment the Puerto Rican
Studies programs at City University
of New York and State University of
New York are under attack. In
Queens College the program was
eliminated. at Brooklyn College it is
under strong pressure. and at City.

Lehman. and Hunter. its develop-‘

ment hair been curtailed. dam.

The same situation has developed
at SUNY. especially in Buffalo and
Albany. where the Puerto Rican
Studies programs have suffered
signiﬁcant cuts. ~

This is also linked to the elimina-
tion of open admissions in the
CUNY system and the lack of
recruitment programs for minorities
at SUNY. It would seem that the
only way the white establishment
(which controls the University
system in the state of New York) can
perceive “minorities” in higher
education isthrough SEEK or EOP.

The Black community in this
country has been able. in its struggle.
to produce its own intellectual and
political leadership. They have
newspapers. magazines. political
and cultural organizations that have
an important bargaining power
when confronting White America.

In our case. our development as a
national minority has been different
due to the colonial situation of Puer-
to Rico. The mass migration of
Puerto Ricans to this countryduring
the fifties came as a result of Opera—
tion Bootstrap: the economic
program devised for the North
American corporations that now
control the island's economy.

The average Puerto Rican that
migrated in the ﬁfties was a person
that did not have any knowledge of
the English language. it was a non—

‘illed worker. and its formaleduca-
“on was at the fifth grade level.

The Puerto Rican migrant was to

equality of opportunities. etc.). It
becamea victim of the colorlinethat
divides this society and of racism in
its day-to-day life.

The Puerto Ricans were going to
suffer. not only social. political and
economic discrimination; but also
cultural aggression that will make se-
cond generation Puerto Ricans
aware of the dynamics of American
society. and will lead our young peo-
pie to political militancy in the six-
ties.

As a result of this struggle. Puerto
Rican Studies programs began'to
develop in the universities and
bilingual programs in the public
school system. The lack of qualiﬁed
personnel for these programs will
force the Puerto Rican community
“to import" its resources from the
island. and a new generation of
Puerto Ricans will be confronted
with the inequalities of education
and the elitism and racism of White
administrators.

At the universities. We will be
labelled. ﬁrst as "hispanics" and later
ans “Spanish Surname." Tokcnism
will be the role assigned to us in the
universities. The liberal expression
will be reduced to having a "nigger"
or a “spik” to prove the liberalism of
the system.

At this moment. due to the lack of
political powor of our community.
the system has reached the conclu-
sion that ﬁrst. we the Puerto Ricans.
and then the Blacks are expendable.

Successful Celebration

l’uerzii Latina celebrated Puerto
Rico Discovery Day for the ﬁrst time
in the organizationﬁhistory,with a
weekend which turned out to be a
splendid one. Thanks to Social and
Cultural committee. who was the
subgroup in charge of the activity.
the weekend which consisted of a
Disco Dinner Dance on Friday and
of a performance of Teatro
llorinkcn‘s “Isla de Sangrc“ plus the
dance with Pete "El Conde“
Rodriguez. attracted more people
than ever for any Fall semester ac-
iivitythat Fuerza Latina hasthrown.
\lso. thanks to the Propaganda
i ’llI’lI’IlIllCe for having donea ﬁnejob
.n spreading the word around. as far

. New York City.

On Friday the dinner was late. but
ilic delicious taste of arroz con
iocino. fricase dc polio. and the
green salad made the waiting
worthwhile. moreover. James“ music
and the wine and beer added to make
this an over all enjoyable night.

That same night there was a hustle
and salsa contest. judges which
seem a little over done with alcohol
for their choices of winners did not
match with the mayority's consen-
sus.

On Saturday teatro Borinkdn and
Juan Angel Silcn put on a perfor-
mance that aroused the sentiment of
the audience. “Isla de Sangrc“ as
dramatized by featro Borinkc’n un-

der the guidance of Juan Angel ex- I

pressed the historically continuous
struggle for Independence of the
people that inhabited the island that
was later named Puerto Rico.

In the evening. people began to
arrive at the Ballroom. indeed. to
have a ball; a ball they got for the
anxiety that built up by the late
arrival of “El Conde’" was then
released on the dance floor. This was

demonstrated by the way people
kept crowding the dance floor.

It seems to me that the Ballroom
had never been ﬁlled with so many
latinos at one time.

' havei'beeiildénied to us as their ,

rationale.

They will even go so far as to say
that there is no such thing as Puerto
Rican history or culture and that our
language is a dialect because we do
not speak Castilian Spanish.

The other argument is that Black
and Puerto Rican Studies do not
have any academic importance nor
are they meaningful to higher educa-
tion. This argument brings out the
old concept of America as a “melting
pot." based on the supremacy ofthe
Anglo culture and the ' "
of the minorities.

Political and economic con-
siderations are the backbone ofthcir
rationale and the hidden purpose is
the dismantling of the achievements
of our people.

The situation. at this time. calls for
a joint struggle to defend what we
have achieved: to break down their
legal. administrative. political and
economic offensive against us; and
to develop to a maximum our
mutual understanding. at the same
time. to be aware of our own con-
" I. I.

Your article is an important part
in the development of' this mutual
understanding. The understanding
that Puerto Ricans iii the U.S. and in
Puerto Rico are a partma very im-
portant part A—vof the Third World
people's struggle against im-
perialism. colonialism. racism and
cultural aggression.

We as Hispanics must realize the
signiﬁcance of having an organiza-
tion such as“Fuerza Latina." for the
preservation of our cultural values
and heritage:

we the Hispanics are often an
anonymous entity in affirmative
action piograms. We receive little

attention from Wiles" 5m" we
note the absence of hispanic Ad
ministrators and faculty. moreover.
we ﬁnd ourselves away from
home for the ﬁrst time. in most
cases; thus. we are lost in the
wilderness. Coldness and rigidity
characterize this university setting;
the temptations to drop out
sometimes overwhelms us. largely
because we are blind to the subjec-
tiveforcesthat ticf upon us '0
“break” our weak will to achieve.

We as a student body must
mobilize our organization to per-
form administrative functions. such
as. recruiting students to this univer-
sity and most direct a campaign to
raise the consciousness of the ig-
norant and apathetic Iatinos. Those
that don't give a damn about the well
being of their hispanic fellows must
be put in their place. Fucrza Latina
should devote much effort toward
issues concerning our education.
These issues should includeimorc
Hispanic Administrators. more
faculty, increase Hispanic stu-
dciit population. and strive for
increase in.|' unding of Puerto Rican
Studies Dept. and Inter-American
Studies, .

With these accomplishments we
can expand and receive the recogni-
tion and respect we deserve. And
perhaps just as important. we can
create a better atmosphere for our
comrades to educate themselves.

We must maintain our cultural
and linguistic identity and must
desperately develop skills that Will
enable us to live useful. purposeful
and rewarding lives. without having
our values and heritage denied and
rejected.

3:00 Monday afternoon. I’m going to
interview Jane Fonda tonight. and I don‘t
have any idea what I'm goingto ask her.

Fonda. and I‘m not quite sure what
activities she's been politicizing recently.
She‘ll probably want to discuss more than
her pictures. so I go do some research.
I had heard the Playboy interviewed

3 her a few years ago. but didn't have any

idea whether it was three years ago or
seven. I went to the library to look
through the microf‘ilms.

I ran to the information desk. and

reproduction of the color pictures was
surprisingly clear. Frequently. my hand
got tired. and l rested for four or ﬁve
minutes. again taking note of how little
was lost in the transition to black and
white.

Reminding myself that I only had 20
minutes until class. I found page 209: Sex
Stars of 197]. My fuck a photo essay.
After a few minutes. I realized that
pictures of Ursqu Andress and Karen
Black and even Jane Fonda were not
going to give me much insight into
I‘ondzi‘s life. I returned to my smiley
friend at tile information desk.

"I972. please“

She wordlcssly retrieved it for me.

see l'ondti again in Sex Stars of ‘72. I

realized the stickiness of the situation.
What little pride I have told me to be
mildly discreet. I waited for the crowd
around the desk to filter away. and then
quietly spoke the call numbers. "Can I
please have AI’ 2 49'!“

The woman at the desk smiled. l was
about to explain that I had to interview
Jane Fonda in ii few hours and that I had
a couple of classes to go to before then
and was in a hurry and only wanted to
