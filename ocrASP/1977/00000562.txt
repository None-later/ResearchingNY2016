value

To the Editor:

I would like to extend my wholehearted
thanks to Mr. Harold C. Steinlicht for his
comments. It is most gratifying to me. an old
time food service employee. that someone
understands the value of food in general and at
the University food service in particular.

our
pan

To the Editor:

We are writing in response to the letter to
the editor in Tuesday. Nov. lSih ASP. entitled
"school spirit." We agree with Mr. Toretto
concerning the fact that the outside
community (media) and even university
members lnck spirit when we undoubtedly
have a tremendous sports program. which we
all should be proud of. HOcher. with regard
to Mr. Torctto's remarks about the fraternities
and sororities on campus. we feel clarification
becomes necessary. Mr. Torctto feels that the
Greeks on campus should take it upon
themselves to initiate school spirit with regard
to sports by sponsoring spectator buses. etc.

e think he is overlooking u very importunt
point.

Aside from the fact that there is an
abundance of Greeks 'at all the games. whether
they be football. soccer. or basketball: there

are also Greek members on these varsity teams

and in the Pep Band. Also. conlrnry to what
Mr. Toretto claims. the fraterniiics und
sororities do hold," number ofnprc-gumc
irit. Mnny of our rush
functions center around the gnmcs and these
are open to the entire university community.
Also. for example, at football gnmcs. at
number of kegs can be seen on the hilly side of
the field ~puid for out ofour own frnlcrnity or

 

 

 

sorority dues and enjoyed by everyone, Greek W
members or not. Banners. ﬂoats, marchers.
etc. at games and in the Homecoming
Parades largely come from the Greek
organizations.

In addition to this, fraternity and sorority
members strike up school spirit in other areas
of the university. We are involved on judicial
hoards. Quad boards, and Residence staffs. If
it weren‘t for the Greeks here at Albany State.
Holiday Sing would have died two years ago.
AMlA and WIRA are ﬁlled with teams and
council members from fraternities and
sororities. All of which we believe promote
school spirit.

Mr. Toretto thinkstheGrceksshould be the
lnitintors of school spirit in the sports arena.
We'd like to remind him that this is not our
main purpose. Cheerleaders, etc. choose this
us their main concern and they should,
therefore. take the initiative.

Apnthy is 2: disease found in all areas oflifc
and it is very hard to cure. Wcjoincd 21 Greek
orgnni/ntion to become involved in this
university. not to be upnthctic. und from the
previous paragraph. we feel wcnrc active and
involved. However, marking a slum at the
people who, (to use Mr. Toretlo‘s words)
“Work their tails off“ every your to make
Alhuny Stutc number one in all aspects. (like
we Greeks do) will only make the situation
worse. There is tin old saying that fits well here
and which Mr. 'l'oretto and others should
rcnli/c. As for its spirit and concern about the
university gocs with the Greeks. critici/ing us
in like "biting the bond that feeds you,"

“’3 Great To Be A Dane

had its chance last year. But this year, its the football team’s chance. A
chance at what? A national championship. That‘s right, a national
championship. '

Tomorrow, the Albany State Great Danes football team-WOII
feat-will play the Hampden—Sydncy Tigers in Virginia for a chance to
move into ‘ the semi-ﬁnals of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Division III Championships.

Should the Danes win just three more games, without a loss, they can
rightfully claim to be the best football team in the nation among some
200 Division III schools.

Not bad for a team that started off the year looking like they would
suffer a second straight losing season. The Danes were literally blown
out in the season opener against St. Lawrence, 30—7. If you think it's
windy on the Quads, you should have been in St. Lawrence for that
game.

But the Danes certainly are no losers. Facingtheir toughest schedule
in their five-year history.(six Division Ill schools and three Division ll),
the Danes have shown they can play with any team in their league and
even the teams that are supposed to be better than Albany. the Division
II schools. The Danes beat their all three at atimc when a [085 could have
ended their playoff hopes.

The reason for the team's great success this year-leadership.

Lust year the Danes tricd three different quarterbacks. And when they
finally decided on the one they wanted. Brad Aldrich, he got hurt.

This year, Aldrich has been at the helm all the way. He has given his
[cum on offense which didn‘t have to throw only as a last resort.
Aldrich‘s ztrm has kept opposing defense honest. not lcttingit key on the
run.

But the team is more than Aldrich. There is the running game. The
Dunes wishbonenlknsct-ch by Sam Haliston, Glenn Sowalskie and
Co. ran over just-'about-every opponent this year.- < - 

And while the offense has run circles around everyone. the defense has
done just the opposite. holding ouch opponent to only 90 yards on the
ground.

lhc defense, aided by the fact that there was a returning starter at
every position this year. has risen to the occasion when needed all year

 

 

The Last Laugh

by Richie Mermelstein

it‘s been a loser of u ycnr.

Look at New York. look at SU NYA. look at
Albnny. look out any window. look All you.
look at me.

We‘ll start with the University at Albany.
The Chemistry Department lost their l’h.l)
program. The Class of '78 lost Bencckc.
SUNYAlost its president. Concert llonrd lost
Hull and Outs, while Speakers Forum lost
llcri Lance. Country Squire residents lost
their bent and cooking utensils. and UAS lost
its shin.

Now that I've lost everything to you...

The City of Albany lost its big boss, and its
municipully funded brothels. And on
successive days in my urcn of Hudson Avenue.
we lost our water. electricity. and our wutcr
again.

I woke up today, I was crying. lost in a lost
world
«Michael Plndcr

Turning to the Big Apple. we lost our very
core. In a period of six months we lost The
Franchise. Broadway Joe. and Clyde. As if
losing Scuvcr, Numuth. und Frazier wasn‘t
enough, we gave uwuy Tiny Archibald too. We
lost summertime utopiu in Ccntrnl Park to
something called The Dr. Pepper Music
Festival. (It's not a coin, it‘s not it root beer.
but most of all. it's not Shncfcr bccr.)
