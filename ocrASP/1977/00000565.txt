“We're capable of batting a good
season.” said Bob Lewis, Albany
State's junior varsity basketball

coach. I I

The Albany State Pups begin their
twenty-game season Nov. 30 on the
road, where they‘ll be playing thir-
teen times this winter. They face
Junior College of Albany in the
opener. and according to Lewis. it
will be the start of a “very challeng-
ing" schedule. I

Employing ii passing game
offense, which Lewis noted is the
modern trend in college basketball
(North Carolina and Indiana use it).
the Pups hope to work the ball in-
side.

"It [the offense] is based more on
the principles of movement rather

  Jvcagers Should Be Exciting

than position," he said. “I think our
team will blend into the offense
well."

The eighth-year Pup‘s coach ex-
pects that the offense, similar to
what varsity will install, will provide
the opportunity for good. short-
range jump shots. Defensively. the
Pups plan on starting off man to
man. but won‘t hesitate to switch.
"We plan to change the defenses dur-
ing the game to keep the other team
off balance." said Lewis. l‘hc club
has been working diligently on this
aspect of the game which usually
decides its outcome.

Height looms as a problem. l'he
I’ups are not blessed wrth anyone
over (1‘5". which makes hitting the
hoards a number one priority.

At this carlypincturc. Lewis is not

content with his players‘ reboun-
ding. He indicated that it will be the
“key to our season.“

One of the most exciting parts of
basketball is the well-executed frill-
court press. And the Pups, with their
good speed. will rely on it not as an
occassional weapon. but instead asa
constant one.

“We plan to. do a lot of pressing
because we‘re not a big team.“ said
Lewis. “We‘re gonna press endlineto
endline, and run as much as we can.“

There are 14 freshman (12 will
travel to non-local games) on the
squad, Never before has Lewis
carried so many. He pointed out the
difficulty in making the final cuts,
which emphasizes one of the team‘s
greatest strengths - their depth.
Lewis will be able to go to his bench

without being hurt.

In terms of who the staning ﬁve
will be. Lewis was unsure at this
ti me. “I have not counted anyone out
as having a chance to start."

Women Swimmers Off To Good Start

the Albany State women‘s swim-
ming and diving team is off to a
strong start. fielding one of the

('oacli (iillis is optimistic about
the rest of t he season. "We could win
them all. but we have out work cut
otit Ior us. And we could really use
some support at our next two home
meets [No\. 30 and Dec. 3|. We‘re
finally a respectable team and we
want people to know that."

Look I’orward

Although the season officially
ends in l)eccmber.se\'cral swimmers
and divers are looking forward totlic
State Championships at the end of
l‘L'lirlltIl‘)‘. “Ibis is a new Albany
State Swimming learn. and we real-
ly want to go as far as we can."

A leading candidate to be starting
point guard is Erv Roberson. Ron
Knox. Don .luron. and Marty
McCrraw are also competing for one
of three guard spots.

Ray Cesare. the brother of I977
Albany State graduate and varsity
starter Vic, has an “excellent chance
to be stoning at the post or forward
position.“ according to Lewis.

I'he tallest player on the Pups is
.lirit llittker. He has ii good shot at
the center job. as does Dan ('iiscy.
\\l1t) Will also s ' at forward.

"l'in \ery satisfied with the at-
titudc ol the team." concluded
Lewis. “Of all the teams I‘\ecoaehcd
licrc they're in the top three iiitcrnis
of attitude.

"I would encourage the spectator
to come down to otir gariies. We‘re
gonna play the type of game that's
entertaining. It Will be the type of
game people like to see . . . We're
not running and gunning. btit it (the
game) will be at a last tempo."
