The Danes then pulled together
and started playing excellent rugby.

on Nov. 9, an estimated 150 spec-
tators witnessed one of the more
memorable games in AMIA League
I history; the championship contest
between Bimbo's Bombers and the
Colonists which the Bombers won
19—6.

It was uninteresting clash betWeen
tw0 relatively opposing styles. The
Colonists are a poised and well
drilled team; a dynasty that held the
title for the three previous years. The
Bombers were mostly ex-Albany
State football and rugby players who
relied more on individual ability and
team strength.

Physical Contact

Extreme physical contact was an-
ticipated because of their two
previous games and six AMIA
referees were summoned to the
grime.

l‘he Bombers opened the game
with a 55-yard scoring play from
Matt Croak to Bimbo Kammcrcr.

that was all very comforting. but
Gilbert still needed a goal: he had
scored twice this season but both had

themselves trailing 6-0 as the extra
point try failed.

Larry Harris and Evan Benjamin
led a spirited specialty squad that put
the Colonists in a hole for most of
the half. Bill Stockwell and his
team‘s aggressive play were not
enough to keep the talent-laden
backfield of Tom Herman. Steve
Schwartz and Tom Been in check.

the score at six when Herman ran
behind the crunching line play of
Steve Miller. John DiKaro and
Mike Smith. The extra point failed.

I’ass protection by Kevin O‘Connell
and Don Rossi were keys to the
Bombers passing success.

from deep in their zone. Both backs

the Colonists placed the Bombers in
a fourth and goal situation from the
twenty. Croak found the cverpresent

Swimmers Host Annual Relays

by Mitch Chaltln

Tomorrow the Albany State
men‘s swim team will host the annual
Great Danes Relays at 1 pm. at the
University Pool.

12 schools from across the state
wrll compete in tomorrow's events.
In the two year college division will
be Morrisvillc. Orange Community
College. l‘armingdalc. and
('obleskrli. In the four year division
along with Albany will be Union
College. l’lattsburgb. Keene. Coast
Guard. RI’I. Bridgewater. and New
l’altl.

Coach Ron White had these
predictions for tomorrow‘s meet.
“Looking at the seeding times our
main competition will be coming
from Coast Guard and RPI. Albany
is seeded third with RI’I seeming to
have a slight edge over us but i‘vc
been very conservative in my seeding
but our performance in the water
will mean the difference between a
second and a third."

Improvement

A second or third place finish for
Albany wrll mean an improvement
over last year's fourth place finish.
