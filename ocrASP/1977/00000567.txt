The Danes and the Tigers are two

NCAA Championship game to be
played in Alabama on Dec. 2 in the
Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl.

“Hampden-Sydney is a very good
football team." said Albany's head
coach Bob Ford. “Hey. at this point.

And the Tigers have some
statistics to back up that claim. They

fourth leading scorer among Divi-

The senior running back has run
for nearly I400 yards and scored I6
touchdowns. Ferguson is an ex-
plosive threat as he carries a 6.1

Besides an outstanding running
back. the Tigers also possess a super

Dale Marks. a sophomore who
throws the ball left-banded. has

this season as he grabbed 32 passes
for 420 yards and six touchdowns.

Dual Meets, Poll Slowed Down Harriers

by Rich Seiigson

Everyt hing was looking good for
the I977 Albany State cross~country
team. that is in the first half of their
season. But as the dual meets and the
SUNY and Capital District Cham-
pionships became history. the results
were not as bright.

Citing two main causes of
pressure. the desire to win early and
the New York State polls. Albany
State cross-country coach Robert
Munsey explained what he felt the
reasons were behind his squad's
failure in their last four cham-
pionship meets (Albany in-
\iiational. N.Y.S. Invitationals.
l)itision ill Nationals.and lC4A's).

l-irst. looking at the team‘s pre-
season goals. it could be called
()peration turnaround

last tall the barriers were 5-6. It
was Munscy‘s first losing season in
to years at the Albany helm.

Although for most coaches a 5-6
record is not a disaster. for Munsey,
who had never experienced sound
defeat here. it was " there was a
great feeling on the part of all of us
that we had to get back on the win-
ning track. dual-meet wise." said
Muriscy " We had tti get the program
winning."

llllh must-win situation. then. was
rte reason why there was such stress
a the Danes, according to Munsey.
.rid in the long run (no pun intend-
I) It came back to haunt them.

But in their ﬁrst championship
meet. the SUNYACs. Albany did
not let up. They hoped to reach a
small peak here. and were successful.
They became champions without a
whole lot of trouble.

“This is the last time we cashed in
[in an important meet]." said
Munsey. “It restored at little pride in
us." Their fourth-place finish in the
SUNYACs a y-ar ago was oncofthe
dismal moments in an overall disap-
pointing year.

'l‘hen the Danes bree/ed through
the Capital District Championships.
defeating RPI. Union. and Siena. By
this time. as Albany kept on win-
ning. a new statistic came into play

the first time ever New York State
Cross-Country Poll of Divrsion I. II
and Ill schools.

Albany moved up to as high as six-
th place in the rankings. But ll had its
negative effects. according to
Munsey. Ibis was the other half of
the pressure load on the Danes.

“We weren‘t used to the polls.“ ex-
plained Munsey. “It put it for of
pressure on us." the veteran coach
was and still is opposed to them.
"they give a rough. but very rough
guide on whose what."said Munscy.

But Munscy admitted that he and
his squad kept their eyes glued to the
rankings and this mentally burned
themselves out. “I guess we ran out
of gas." noted Munscy.
"Psychological gas. not physical
gas." I

The "energy shortage" began in
their own Invitational. the Danes
hoped to reach a big peak here. but
instead the barriers. according to
Municy. “blurted their progress."
ﬁnishing in a dissatisfying fourth
place. if one or two Danes would

have run up to their ability, they
probably would have claimed the ti-
tle for the first time in eleven years.

Then things went downhill and
fast. Favored in the New York State
lnvitationals at Rochester. Albany
came in fifth place of sixteen teams.
This wits the first indication that
something. which Munsey feels was
stress. was affecting the squad.

"I came within a hairof‘not taking
the team to the Nationals."disclosed
Munsey. “It was a gut feeling I had
that the team wasn't going to do
much."

Munsey‘s vibes were right. The
Danes went to the Division [II
National Championships this past
Saturday (held at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland.
Ohio). and came in 241h of 52 learns.

inches til snow blanketirig the
ground. senior ctr-captain lirian
Davis performed the best for
Albany. Hc nailed down (i(lth place
in a field of 424 runners.

Alter Davrn. the results weren't as
good. Munscy hoped that the Danes
would be among the first twenty
schools. but their usually strong
depth evaded them.

With only one day of rest. Albany
was competing again. On Monday.
they travelled to Van (‘ortlandt ’ark

for their first meet of l977.

liritcred in the second toughest of
three divisions. the University Divi-
sion. the barriers notched a lllh
place finish of 26 teams.

“Our times Were not terribly good.
In fact they stunk." said Munsey.
“But bear in mind we ran hardlytwo
days before. and I think this had a
big effect."

 

It has been a tiring se on for the
Danes. Working out since early
September and running in twelve
meets. wears down a runner and a
coach, as well. according to Munsey.

Undoubtedly the last four meets
removed some of the glory from
Albany cross-country in I977. liut as
next fall rolls around. Mouse) and
his troops will have two plusses on
their side before they start.

First. they will know to ignore the
superficial polls. Secondly. they will
have an advantage that they did not
have this year. returning from a
successful anti winning season.

For the Danes. they are coming
off one of their better defensive
games of the season. but not one of
their better offensive ones. They beat

Bungling 0f Tenure Case Charged '9 1*

agreed with Peabody. Leibowitzsaid
that the circumstances surrounding
the handling of her tenure case. and
the legal suits which followed. were
the real cause for the final retrench~
merit of Comparative Literature. not
financial or academic reasons.

There are numerous suits current-
ly in the ccouris which involve the
Leibowitr. tenure case.

In the center oftlie controversy in
the handling of that tenure case was
former Comparative Literature
Chairman .loscpli Swverffy. A
special Ad lioc Committee created
by former SUNYA President Louis
Rene/ct in I975 to investigate coni-
plaints by Leibowitz about her
tenure case found serious
“procedural and otherirregularities"
in the handling of her case. Many of

these irregularities involvetl Svoverffy

ed the number of departiiienl
members who actually took notice of
this.

the date of the initial department
meeting on the case was changed by
S/overffy without adequate notice.

nient rctiew the carididate'scligibili-

including

before the meeting, he discussed
possible dates with Szoverffy. and
was assured it would not be held on a
day when Peabody knew he would
be out of town.

The meeting was changed to Dec.
18. I974. the day when he was to be
out of town, and a notice of that
change was buried under a pile of
papers in his mailbox. Peabody said.
As a supporter of Leibowitz.
Peabody said he wanted to be at the
meeting, but since he never knew of
the change. and Leibowitz was never
informed of the date — in violation
of the procedures —« he was not pre-
sent. said Peabody.

Sroverffy denies that Peabody
ever told him that he would be away
on that day when the meeting was
held. and claims that adequate
notice was given of the date.

The Ad Hoe committee found that
materials submitted for evaluation
in the tenure case were irregular. The
committee report reads: "A signed
