tion of geological problems.“

Dr. Miyushiro. a native of Japan,
received the award largely for his
study of metamorphic belts.

Geologists have assumed for
many years that metamorphic belts
(underground strata which are
found near volcanic activity) were
caused by high temperature.
Miyushiro's work has shown.
however. that such belts can also be
caused by pressure. Most of
the evidence for this conclusion is
found in arctts called parallel zones
along the Asian Pacific coast.
Miyushiro said.

Miyashiro's ﬁndings and thoeries
are described in greater detail in his
book. Moramorphistn and
Metunmrpltit' Belts.

i he Geological Society of
America is the major organization of
professional geologists in the United
States. according to Burke. Burke
said that winners of the Day Medal
are selected by a special committee
which reviews reccomcndations and
nominations sent in by Society
members frotn across the country.

in recognition of the award.
Miyushiro was presented by his
students with a gold a watch. accor-
ding to .laek Casey. a graduate sitt-
cenl in the department. "Some ol'his
Ideas are far ahead then titnes.".

In: rMiyashiro said lie is "very
pleased“ about winning the award.
and that he is especially grateful lor
the help and support ol his students.
