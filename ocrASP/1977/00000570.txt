The administration knew of the
irregularites involved in her tenure
case but did nothing. Leibowiti said.

Former Vice President for
Academic Affairs Phillip Sirotkin
was informed by Leibowitz of the
circumstances surrounding the intial
meeting on Dec. 24. I9“. and told
her to appeal to her Dean, who wan
then Ruth Schmidt.

“It would have been nice if the ad-
ministration had taken action right
then.“ said Leibowitz.

Instead. according to Peabody.
the administration did nothing. “If
you have a problem just sit on it and
it will go away. that‘s their attitude.”
said Peabody.

Leibowitz was denied tenure at all
review levels. and denied it again
after she was granted another
review. She claims. however. that
this was because of all the
irregularities involved in her case. es-
pecially with the materials submitted
for her evaluation.

At present. suits stemming from
this case involve Leibowitr. S7oierf-
fy. former President Fields and
Benelet. and former Chancellor
Ernest Boyer. among others.

Leibowitr ﬁled a complaint with
the State Di\ision ol Human Rights.

“We have requested that students

Although Spring said some

tinue to live at the motel. Lester said
that there is a mutual agreement
between SUN YA and the motel that
students not sign contracts for the

I denial of tenure. The complaint was

upheld. saying “From the facts ad-

duced it is indicative that the com-~

plainant was denied continuing ap-
pointment because of her sex.“

It is these suits. and what he calls.
“administrative incompetence“ in
not controlling Szoverffy. that
Peabody feels eventually caused the
retrenchment of the Comparative
Literature department.

“The immediate cause was the
Leibowitz tenure case.” Peabody
said.

The Task Force cited low enroll-
ment. lack of ludership. and low
quality of faculty as the reason for
cutting the department. Peabody
asserts that the low enrollment was
only in the classes taught by faculty
loaned from otherdepartments; that
upon Peabody‘s assuming the chair-
manship after Szoverffy the depart-
ment quieted down and there was no
lack of leadership; and that he and
Szoverffy were two of the most
qualified Professors in the
Humanities at that time.

Szoverffy said that the depart-
ment was retrenched to get rid of

 

,hin'aell‘. because he had become

what‘ the administration saw; as a
"complainerl‘ .

Sloverffy said that because he is a
free thinker. and frequently criticiz-
ed what he saw as an overabundance
of administrators in relation to
faculty. he and the department were
expendable in the administration‘s
mind.

“The dissenters are being
eliminated. it‘s precisely what is
happening in Moscow." said
Szoverffy.

German Professor John M.
Spalek. who was chairman of the
Task Force on Priorities and
Resources which recommended the
cutting of Comparative Literature.
said that the Task Force was not in-
ﬂuenced by the administration in its
work.

“We were as independent as possi-
ble.“ said Spaiek. He added that all
the materials available on a given
department were reviewed by the
members of the Task Force. and that
the members never became involved
with looking at personal problems
within a department.

Spalek was also a member of the
Comparative Literature department

at the tiine of the Leibowitz tenure
case. as an adiunct member from the
German department.

Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs David Martin said he agrees
“with Spaiek that the Task Force
never got involved with personal
problems when making their
recommendations.

As for Leibowitz, Martin cited
both the fact that her tenure was
denied “solidly up the line” and that
she lost her appeal the second time
around as proof that her case had no
real merit for tenure.

Szoverffy‘s handling of the
Leibowitz tenure case was called
"unfortunate" by former SUNYA
President Louis Benezet on June 25.
I975.

In a letter of Szoverffy on that
date. Benezet stated about the case:
"What has gone on has amounted to
an unhappy chapter in the academic
leadership of an important depart-
ment in this University Center."

He also said “I believe the Univer-
sity‘s interests as well as your own
will be best served by your relin-
quishment of the chairmanship at
the earliest practicable time. The
decision and implementation con-

Vice Chairman of the SUNY
Board of Trustees James Warren
said that the retroactive aspect of the
students‘ Health Fee protest is a
"poor" strategy.

Warren said. “We have to ask
ourselves. ‘Where will the $1.!
million that SU NY expected to have
in its budget come from?" A Spring
boycott may cause some programs
to be hurt. according to Warren.

Warren said. “We have to make
sure the fee is not in next year's

need the energy to do twice as much
good latter.“

According to Community Relatlons Dlrcctor PhllllpJohnson,lhe new
publication will be geared more toward features.

by Steven J. Sllverberg

The Tower Tribune. ‘a publication
of the SUNYA News Bureau. will be
replaced next semester by a new
newspaper published in cooperation
with Office of Community
Relations.

Community Relations Director
Phillip Johnson said the new
publication. tentatively called Un-
iversity News. will be larger that the
Tower Tribune and take a format
more oriented toward features.

The Tower Tribune. funded from
the SUNYA budget. has depleted in
size in recent years due to reduced
funding. It currently appears as a
one-page mimeo sheet on legal size
pttpcr. and carries no photographs
or commcricttl advertisements.

University News Bureau staff
member Bob Rice said that a recent
increase in funding was part of the
reason for collaborating with the
Community Relations Office in star-
ting the ncw publication.

“We felt that a new newspaper was
tlte answer.“ Rice said. “It will be a
better paper containing more

features than the Tower Tribune."

Rice said the new paper will be
published weekly on four l l" by l7"
pages. and may use the facilities of
an old print shop on the Draper cam-
pus downtown. The services that
can't be performed at that shop may
be put out to bids, he said.

An editorial board. set up by the

N ewTPaper Will Succeed  

Office of Community Relations

staff. is planned to meet monthly to f A

discuss the new paper's general
policies, Rice said. -

The new paper will contain un-
iversity news. feature articles, service
announcements. job openings, and
information about civil tests, Rice
said.

Students working on the
newsletter may recieve RCO credit.
Baron and Gold went to Robert E.
Sanders of the RCO department
asking for a project to be setup giv-
ing students credit for working on
the newsletter.

Sanders said. “I'm amenable to
working out a project with the
students who are doing the letter."
The project would involve analyzing
the letter after publication for
strengths and weaknesses. thus mak-
ing the work on the newsletter an
tires of study.

Sanders also said there would be
no prerequisites but he would like to
see students involved who are doing
coursework in related areas. such as
Sociology. Political Science and
Journalism. so the students will have
a basis for anticipating problems in-
volved in this type ofpublic relations
publication. The amount of credit
the students will receive will depend
on the students background and the
amount of time they spend on the
project.

llaron said she doesn‘t feel the
ASI’ covers enough student issues.

“ l'Iic ASI’ only covers what they
think is newsworthy. flicrc iirc
different levels of iiewsina Universi-
ty coittniunity rind there is no reason
why. as a government. we can‘t print
at paper on what we are doing."
Baron and (iold both said the
newsletter is not an alternative paper
and is not iii competition with ASP.

In it related matter. Central Cuiin~
cii voted to fund Season Ticket. it
new monthly magazine about cam-
pus sports. $300.00. The paper will
cover women's sports. recreational
sports. and minor ittcn's sports.

The $300 will pay l'ortwo trial
issues. According to organizer Anne
Markowitx, the paper may become ti
biweekly. if response to the trial ver-
sions is sufficient.

According to Markowitl. support
from WIRA was strong and she is
expecting the same from AMIA.
