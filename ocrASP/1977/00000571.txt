ROWDY ROCKERS

Two guitariststravelling with rock *
Star Rod Stewart were arrested in
Lakeland, Florida. on third degree-
felony charges of destroying their
hotel room.

Polk County Sheriff‘s deputies say
that 27-yearvold Gary Granger and
31-year-old James Kreegan are ac-
cused of throwing lamps through
windows. ripping up the curtains
and tearing down part of the ceiling
in their room at the Holiday Inn in
Lakeland. Damages were estimated
at $2000.

The two were taken into custody
and then later released on 82000
bond each. They appeared as
scheduled in concert with Stewart
later that night.

Where was Rod when all of this
happened? According to deputies. he
was in a room nearby. sleeping un-
disturbed.

DUMB BIRDS

Speaking of dumb turkeys. The
San Francisco Chronicle reports
young turkeys have been known to
starve to death because they didn‘t
recognize food when they saw it.
They have also died ofthirst because
they didn‘t have sense enough to
drink the water placed in front of
them.

To help these poor dumb birds
along. many breeders rely on the
turkey‘s natural fascination with
bright colors. The ranchers will otten
place food and water on bright-
colored plates so that the birds will

be attraeed to them and pack away at
them. With luck. the gobblers will
pick up enough food to keep them
going while attacking the plates.

It is also necessary. The Chronicle
reports. to round off the square cor-
ners in breeder houses so that baby
turkey's won‘t pile up in the corners.
ln square turkey houses, trafficjams
often occur at the corners. and those
at the front of the pack sometimes
are smothered.

TIS THE SEASON

Springtime has long been though
of as being the most romantic season
of the year.

However. a series of new German
studies has found that right now. in
the autumn. is when most romances
really blossom.

Prevention magazine reports that
German doctors recently discovered
that in most men. the production of
the male hormone testosterone
reaches its highest levels in the fall.
and its lowest levels in the spring.

This was surprising. the magazine
says. because "it had generally been
assumed that people are pretty much
like animals. and animals do most of
their mating in the spring."

Prevention adds that “another
(Jerman scientist conducted a survey
of 1000 married couples and found
that 53 per cent met and fell in love in
the autumn." To round out this pic-

lure. a third survey has purportedly
found that the majority of divorces.
62 per cent in fact. stem from spring
romances.

POT ADS

If an Atlanta. Georgia. organiza-
tion has its way, TV commercials
promoting the sale of marijuana will
begin appearing on the tube next
month.

A group called “International
Marijuana Wholesalers and Dis-
tributors” says it has produced l0-,
20-. and 30<second spots. promoting
the idea that consumers even today
should be speculating in pot futures.

The commercials stress that the
weed is still illegal in most jurisdic-
tions; but they warn that ifand when
dope is legalized. there will be
suddenly a ﬂourishing commodities
market for pot. similar to the ﬂue-
tuating markets for wheat or coffee
beans today.

Speculators are being invited to
buy marijuana futures now. at prices
of SI for a single joint or $50 a
pound. The dope will reportedly be
delivered the minute the prohibition
against pot is lifted.

The marijuana ads will be offered
to TV stations in Georgia. beginning
in early December. One of the ads
depicts a background voice asking a
potential customer: “Want to cop
some reefer'.’ Now you can. at great

prices too." It explains that when the
weed prohibition is lifted. the follow-
ing scene will become commonplace.
The scene shows a large delivery
truck pulling up to a stop. and then
beginning to unloload doiens of
bales of freshly harvested grass.

HOLE IN THE WALL

New York‘s Attorney General has
cracked down on the promotoers of
a gadget called a “Spy Eye.” that
allegedly enables its owners to see
through six-inch walls.

The company making “Spy Eye“
advertised the gismo as a “super wide
panoramic lens." that “opened up
(the) private lives" of their
neighbors.

Attorney General Louis
Lefkowitz says that what consumers
actually received was a miniature
telescope and a one-half-inch drill
bit to get through the wall. “Spy
Eye" ‘5 makers have been ﬁned $500.

WRONG NUMBER

Narcotics agents in Santa Bar-
bara. California. are facing up to the
sad news that their big bust wasjust a
wrong number.

Law enforcement officials in that
town got ready for the big bust when
they found a telephone number in
the ledgers ofa suspected drugdealcr
they had arrested.

After getting an address for that

NEW MAJOR

It used to be that many students
were Political Science majors; today,
however. more might be better
described as “Farah Faweett-
Majors.“

A poll of 309 students at the Un-
iversity of Wisconsin found that
most of those surveyed could cor-
rectly identify T-V personalities and
newscasters. but were unable to
recognize signiﬁcant news-makers.

The most-recognized figure in the
poll was Farah Fawcett-Majors.
while stansﬁqeld Turner. the current
director of the CIA. was correctly
identiﬁed by the fewest number of
students.

College Press SService reports
that a large number of students mis-
identiﬁed the code name of the CIA
drug program. “M-K-Uitra." as a
toothpasw ingredient. and that the
same number thought the "DEA"
was a campus fraternity.

THE BRIGHT SIDE

The Saturday Review reports that
art may not only be good for the
soul. but for the brain as well.

The Review quotes two

researchers. Doctors Robert
Masters and Jean Houston. as fin-
ding that children who are deprived
of any art stimulation at early ages
could actually suffer from brain
damage.
Masters and Houston say that the
right side of the human brain is
stimulated by artistic endeavors.
while the left side leans toward the
logical and analytical.

The two researchers warn that
children who are taught only to use
the left side of their brain. the
analytic side. may actually be retar-
ding their brain development.

According to Houston. a child
deprived ofart stimulation is “cut off
from the ways he (or she) can
perceive the world“ and. as a result.
she sayd. “(The) brain is
systematically damaged.“

Masters and Houston report that
such brain damage could result in a
child's being less able in later life to
grasp abstract concepts in math and
science than other children who had
been exposed to the arts.
