“Never Mind The Bollocks"
Sex Plltols
Warner llros. [18K 3 I4 7

 

By Al. BACA

Well. it's finally here. The number one
group in England. the Sex Pistols. have at
last signed with an American record
company. Their debut album. "Never
Mimi the [Jo/locks. Here‘s the Sex
Pistols," is now available to the American
ptiblic.

One would have had to been in a deep
coma to have not heard anything about
the exploits of the Sex Pistols in England
during the past year. They have had three
hit singles. without the benefit of radio
airplay. they were banned from virtually
every rock clitb in the United Kingdom.
and have received more press than any
other new group in existence. With the
release of theiralbiim in the [hated States
it is now possible to see if the Sex Pistols.
who epitomi/c linglish ptrnk rock. can
reach a rriass audience outside of
| rrgland.

lechriieally speaking. the music on the
album is hard-timing. super-energi/ed
rock and roll at it‘s rrtost basic core, to
the lit)\ ice. all the songs may sound alike.
hut alter listening to the album sc\ei'al
times. it becomes apparent that each
individual ctit contains rtsoun message of
desperation or despair.

Ihe group consists of Johnny Rotten
on lead \ocals. l’aul ('ook on drtrms.
Steve Jones on lead gttitiir. and Sid
Vicious on bass. althotigh sortie of the
songs Were recorded while (ilen Matlock
was the group‘s bassist. What really
distinguishes the group from the scores of
other punk rock groups that are forming
in the United States and langland Is the
snarling. artirnalistic voice of Johnny
Rotten. who spits out the words to the
stings with a degree ofhatred and hostility
rar'ely achieved on a vinyl disc.

lhe albrirn itself contains the three
songs that reached number one in
l-irgland. "(iod Sine the Queen."
"Anarchy in the UK." arid “Pretty
Vacant." plus nine additional cuts. One
must listen to the album several times in
order to understand the lyrics. but once
the listener begins to relate to the words of
the songs. he will be encouraged to play
the album over and over again.

"EMl" is a song which deals with the
time FMI. lingland's most conservative
record company. signed the Sex Pistols
Ior 3580.000. then cancelled the contract
alter Steve Jones threw upon an old lady
in piihlie. One can tell from the lyricsthat
the Sex Pistols hold nothing back in their
songs. ()n “liMl.” they virturrlly attack
the record coriipariy that terminated their
contract (“i tell you it was all a

 

 

 

     
 

anarchist] I don’t know what I want/ But I
know how to get it.“)

To those who are able to empathize
with the intense emotion generated by the
Sex Pistols. the album may be hailed as a
masterpiece of rebellion. The music is as
subtle as German blitzkrieg. The only
problem with the album is that the music
will either hit you and leave you
completely stunned. or it will seem like a
lot of noise. To anyone who has ever been
angry. hurt. or in any way affected by
anything. this album is required listening.

Yet on Sandman. his second album.

music on it to make one optornistie about

The major problem wrtlt .S'mri/riraii is

'ilhum’s‘ tcn songs and there is really

'l hey are all country—flavored lint: songs
with arrangements that lead non here.
As an interpreter. l’ederscn isn't bad,
Maybelle ('ttt‘ler"s. "l‘air and leader
Ladies" is done tip well here and shows
the possible future direction he should
take. An interpretation of ()dell
Mcleod's. "('ora is Gone” is beautiful. it
has an ethereal lcel heightened by Holly
