David Brenner entertained a close to sell-out SUNYA crowd with such lines
as "my teacher's lace was like a bouquet ol elbows!“ So look who'stalklng.

By DENNIS SCHEYER

it has been two weeks since the David
Brenner concert which, for those of you
who missed it, was held in the University
Gym before a close to sell-out audience.

Rumor had it that in addition to the
usual bleacher seating there were going to
be semi-comfortable chairs. They ne.er
showed up. No major problem . . . out
it would have been nice.

the evening begins as a tall lanky man
with a big nose wearinga-brown corduroy
three-piece suit appeared on the stage.
Alter disposing of the stool (a stand-up
comedian to the hilt) Brenner went to
work. lite audience obviously was
psyched lor Brenner. liven the opening,
“How ya Doin'i" got a big laugh.

Brenner had a joke for
everything . . . and they were funny
too! lhere were nose jokes, short people
jokes. and of course. mother jokes:

Brenner: "But lony‘s mother gave him
an ice-cream cone!“

Mont. You do everything lony does!
Would you rump olt the limpire State
lituldiug ll lony dtd‘.’

l'urthermore there were older brother
msz and e\eu older sister_|okes. But the
best was the speedreading jokes. “What
happens when speedreaders get to the
funny parts?“

Brenner‘s metaphors would please
many an linglish comp professor. He told
us that his leaclter's face was like: “a
bouquet ol elbows! She even had blue

hair!“

We were told that his appearances on
television game shows were not all fun
and games. Like the time he was doing
word-association on the “The Magic
Marble Machine“ when he was asked to
name an “athletic supporter" and he said
"Jock!"

While. a live performance to a college
audience is far different from appealingto
an audience in their living room. such as
his Tonight Show visits. ‘ Brenner‘s
appearances in Lits Vegas prepared him
well for this. He totally succeeded in
relating to everyone in the crowded gym.

Unlike a George Carlin or Robert
Klein. most of Brenner‘s material is ad-
lib, as in Brenner‘s case. improvisation is
what makes his act unique enough to be
successful.

Brenner‘s onstage manner is best
describes as “loose.” His routine. which
primarily ad-lib. follows a well rehearsed
format. Brenner mentioned his upcoming
appearance on " l he lonight Show“ Dec.
5. o. and 7th. He told the audience that a
majority of the routine they heard that
night “as new material that he was
testing. l he audience was the catalyst for
what he would use on “lonight.” He
thanked them for their help.

Brenner‘s perfonnancc lasted almost
two hours. a long monologue by anyone‘s
standards. throughout. he kept the
audience laughing; the obvious
hallmark of any good comedian.
