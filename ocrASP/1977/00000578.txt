gripe

To the Editor:

The ASP has slapped all SA groups in the
face by raising its ad rates in reaction to the
symbolic funding of the four Class
Governments. The Class Governments
collectively represent as many undergraduates
as does Student Association. In the past the
ASP would not give ad discounts to thc
Classes because the ASP was then funded by
SA. Since the ASP Went independent some
time ago, the classes have asked, begged, and
argued for the ad discount given to other
similar primarily mass programming groups
such as the Quad Boards. The Classes agreed
to the $l.00 SA funding in order to get the ad
rates we felt that wedescrvcd. in the past Class
Governments have had to use MYSKANlA‘s
name to get the ad discount; this practice has
been continued this year by the (‘lass of‘7ll
and SA in order to save Class funds. To argue
that Class Governments were not worthy oi it
discount because they are not SA funded is
like heating a dead horse.

Class Governments strive to scrvc the
University Community that we all livc in; thc
ASI’ in raising its ad rates stabde tiic
University Community in its back. Class
Governments have enjoyed a good working
relationship with the ASP o\cr the last few
ycars; but the Class Governments should not
be used a the scapegoat for it qucstionnhlc
raise in ad rates. Something is rottcn at
Albany State.

safety

To the Editor:

Sincc till sttiic pcoplc ttrc conccrncd with
their personal safety, it is not unreasonable to
assume that they are intcrcstcd in firc safety
procedures. As it resident of the Country
Squire Motcl. it is my hclicf that thc
management's concern for their patron's
“clinic is minimal. “mic is causc for alarm
dcspitc tbc fact that thc oulcr and back units
of each room are cindcrblock. liic Mills
adjacent to each room are not. “mm is an
itch“: ventilator system. and it runs through
the top of each room. in thc event of fire.
smoke and gases can bc rcodily transferred
lrom room to room. Morcovcr, thcrc is no
alarm system: no buncrs, no bclls. no sircns.
lbcrc is nothing to tllCl‘l students.

The management has ttol forgotten us and
in it “ttoic to all studcnls.“ they have provided
us witlt a fire “proccdurc.” 'l'hc notc strcsscs
that in case of fire thc student should liisl
evacuate the room. Second, the studcnts Ill
cl'fccl bccomc ti vocal alarm systcin and are
instructed to call out loudly. The third
objcclivc is alert the miinugcmcnt
“iiitnicdiatcly if possible." And firstly, we are
to "knock oii all doors to awaken slccpittg
residents." The note goes on to say that it tho
fire is uncontainttblc, “there is a dime tiipcd
tinder tbc public iclcphonc." We are to use it to
call the Fire Departmciii. Wc are also urged
not to rcmovc or stcal the dime unless there is
an emergency. I personally have not such the
dune. if it is missing, I do not want to be
accused of theft,

Any fireman will tell you if ii the ciiiinot bc
Limckly extinguished, by a device readily
accessible, to evacuate the building and go for
help. Under no circumstances are you to
rccntcr a burning building. The Country
Squire has three fire extinguishers, of which
hone are readily accessible. They are enclosed
In three locked rooms. Ila student feels that he
can put the fire out. he is to rim to one ofiiic
designated rooms, and since “each room hiisa

window; break the window with an
object. . . to get the ﬁre extinguisher."
Breaking and entering is a criminal offense.
Now even if you don‘t get arrested fortryingto
save the Country Squire Motel, you should be
for reentering a burning buidling.

I would like to urge readers, if ever at the
Country Squire Motel, to watch their words.
False alarms are acriminal offense. Bring your
own dimes.

rude

To the Editor:

The rudeness of many people is often best
expressed in a crowd. where the consideration
for others is lost in the name ofsclf—enjoymcnt.
This was painfully apparent at the David
lircnncr show last Friday. After being forced
to stand f‘oran inordinately longtimc(insomc
ciiscs. several hours) in an overly crowded
place where inconsiderate, impaticnt people
wcasclcd their way into an advantageous spot
in the line they did not deserve, many of us
wcrc utiablc to breathe, let alone movc.
Imagine our distress and disgust, then, not to
be able to brcathc rclativcly cool and fresh air
oncc \\i.‘ wcrc safcly inside the gym because a
\lllilll minority chose to ignore the bright red
“\o Smoking“ signs on the walls. Many could
be such to bc lighting up in the darkness of'tltc
gym. disregarding the possiblity of chokingor
igniting ihcir neighbors. Whether the
substance in question was tobacco or not is
irrclc\'aiit. (At gatlicrings like this. marijuana
smokcrs oficn fch they are cxcmpl from such
rulcs. tcmporiirily forgetting that this is illegal
anyway.) llrcnncr‘s good-natured barb
pointing iii the sign behind him was no help;
llC, liowcicr. was not tbc onc tit fault.

Soon it will be illcgtil to smoke tinythingin
any public place. lbc enforcement of anti-
smoking rules is an impcriitivc if we are to
protcct our lungs and atmosphere, btit is
appears that this long-sought aftcr goal is not
iti sight. Noii-sinokcrs must stand tip lorthcir

Media Blitz

Not since the Australian Sex Baron swept the island of Manhattan
has there been such a fury of interest and activity in the newspaper
business.

The Tower Tribune will soon be thrown tothelionsto make room for
the University News, a SUNYA News Bureau/ Community Relations
Office collaboration. The Season Ticket will appear as a student-run
monthly, dedicated to covering women’s and intramural sports. And
SUNYA's own Baron, SA Vice President Kathy, is working with Presi-
dent Dave Gold on the launching of the SA News, a one page newsletter
devoted to, surprisingly enough, SA news.

Add to this the off campus students‘ newsletter Getting Off, Fuerza
Latina’s La Voz Del Pueblo, which is presently published within the
pages of the ASP, and two new Albany community papers, No Exit
Press and downtown’s South End Scene, and the result is more avenues
of communication than you can shake a pica ruler at. Throw in WCDB—
FM next semester, and SUNYA becomes a real media hotbed.

Which is nothing short of fantastic. With a total population of over
20,000, this university can surely support more than one newspaper.
And competition is a healthy means of improving the quality and quan-
tity of news coverage on campus.

The University News will be an especially welcome addition to the
fold. The ASP is run by students, and covers the news on this campus
from a student perspective; it will be interesting to see how the same
issues look on the faculty/staff side of the podium. The new weekly will
also have its own editorial board, and will hopefully come closer to
fulfilling the role of an objective news source than the Trib, generally
regarded as an administration mouthpiece.

The Season Ticket should also be interesting to watch, as an alter-
native cntry in the sports ﬁeld. They’ll be publishing monthly, and
therefore should have the time to go into more depth in their coverage
than the ASP can, with its twice weekly deadlines. Competition, again,
should insure that more sports are covered, —— and covered well.

it is imperative, though, that these papers be spared the fate of the
Sandbox, the Albany Statement and the Washington Park Spirit. That’s
going to require involvement — yours. With such a large selection to
choose from, there should be something for everyone.

The Albany Student Press welcomes, with open arms, its journalistic
brethren. And wishes them the best of luck.
