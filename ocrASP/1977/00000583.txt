Suits naming the SUNY Board of
Trustees and various SUNYA tid-
ministrtitors have been filed in State
Supreme Court by former SUNYA
Comparative Literature Professor
Judith Leibowitz.

flit: suits revolve around the
tenure proceedings of Lcibowitl. in
tlic ltllc I974 and early I975. which
otic former Cntnpttrtithc LilCI'illuTL‘
professor tcrmcd tin “cinhtirttssing
mess for the administration. The
main dclcndiint iii the Icibuwiu
suits is former Comparative
literature Chairman Joseph
S/ovcrlfy. S‘Invcrl'f'y. not» employed
in Washington |).C.. was the Chair-
mtin of the department when
l.cibiiwit/ L‘ttmt up for tenure in
December of I974.

Also named in the stittsarc former
SUNY Chancellor lzrncst Boyer:
former SUNYA Presidents Louis
lIcnc/ct and linunctl Fields; former
S UNYA Vice President tifActidcmic
Affairs Phillip Sirotkin: and former
Dean of Humanities RtithSchinidt.

lhc first of these stats was filed by

01011” Alan Student Prue Corporation

Lit Prof Files Suits

Leibowitz against vaerffy alone.
In the suit, she charges that Szovcrf—
fy was notified by SUNYA as to tire
rules and procedures of the various
stages in the tenure process. and that
be ignored these rules "by reason of
his malicious and wanton intent to
prevent the plaintiff [Leibowitzl
from obtaining continuing appoint-
ment." Leibowilr also contends that
Slovcrffy knew that if site wcrc not
granted tenure. she would lose lIL‘t
job tit SUNYA.

Icihuwil/ clittrgcs that. in connec-
tioti with the first department
meeting held to consider her ctin-
didticy fortenure.S/ovcrlf'yfttilcd to
trolin her of tire date of the meeting;
prcvctitcd the member of thc depart-
ment with the most know ledge of her
work from attending: did not notify
the student representative until three
months litter; failed to give dcptirl-
inctit members specifications of the
procedures to be followed; did not
.supply any ttiiiilysts ol studcnt
citiluations; underrated ti book she
had written and did not provide ltcr
file to members of the dcpiiitmcnt or

herself; rind threatened her with
reprisnls if she pursued efforts to ob-
tain another departmental review of
her case.

She went on to state in the suit
that following the meeting, Srovcrf—
fy sent his recommendations in it
letter which was deliberately
prcdtttcd to “create the impression
that the candidate‘s request fora new
inccting was too ltitc." l.i:ihoivit/
contends that it request she made for
ii ncw meeting was well within the
time limit.

As the tenure process moved
through various levels. Leibowitl
contends. S/ovcrffy continued to
“dclibcrttlcly tind maliciously tinder—
ininc the process." She charges that
tic rcmovcd documents from Iicr
dossier. and inserted fi‘lludlllclll

Leibowit/ also claims that

fly sought rcveicws of her
book frotn people subject to his iti~
llticnce, and tltcii denied litivirig
done so.

lti addition. she charges Slovcrffy
\vilh intimidating members of com-
millccs considering ltcr candidacy.

SA Delays Stipend Payments

by Matthew ('ox

Although guidelines for it" SA sti-
pt-nd allocation procedure were
passed ttlmosl two months iigo.
leaders of SA-funded groups who
itl'L‘ seeking stipends still haven‘t
received any tnoncy.

Delays in appointing people to it
nine-member stipend committee.
which determines who will get
stipends and how much will be given.
were attributed in by SA officials in
part to confusion over wltcn the
committee was to start operating.

Guidelines for the establishment
of It stipend committee pttrt al'tt
plain to make SA stipend policy
cleaner V were passed by Central
Council on Oct. 14.

Central Couticil Ciniirmtin Mikc
Lissncr said the fitittl appointments
to thc cotnntittcc will probably go
before Central Council for approval

Clan of ‘18 President Gary Bennett uni n mailgrlm to former Clan of
'78 President Marc Bennett. which added I penalty clause of $111 to

loiitort’im.

SA President David (iold. who
appoints one member of the com-
miltcc. released it memorandum
yesterday giving the names of tire
four persons nomittatcd by the SA
lzxcctitivc Committee. Five other
appointments httvc already been ap-
proved.

(iold said the nominations weren‘t
mttdc Cllrllcr bcctiusc he had been un-
dcr the impression that the com
mittee wouldn‘t be formed until next
semester.

Central Council member Abbie
Huvkins. who chairs the SA Internal
Affairs Committee that developed
the guidelines. acknowledged [hill
the committee formation had been
“very slow."

“We may have been neglcelful iii
not putting a time limit on when the
committee had to be formed.“

UPS/IONNE IUCHMAN

Benocko’l propoul for paying back $2600 to tho CIIII of '70.

llavkins said. He also attributed the
delay to the number of people who
nitllv'l.‘ indiViduttl appointments.

Under the guidelines. each of thc
lotir members of the SA Executive
Committee chooses st ttdcnts to serve
on the stipend committee.

|.issncr stiid the cottttnittec will
seek applications from those seeking
stipends iii the remaining weeks of
school. and review those
applications over iiiicrscssion.

“'I‘Iic stipend committee itself
should meet within it wcck or two
after the semester starts," he said.

Students who have worked on
UfgullI/illltlllS this semester must
seek their stipends retroactively.
Lissner said.

The SA Budget Committee last
semester removed all stipend
allocations from the SA budget.

l‘lllillly. she asserts that S/ovcrffy
threatened to sue the SliliYA tid-
ministriition in an effort to prevent
them front tttking tin impartial look
at her candidacy.

Leibuwitr. goes on to say that in
numerous instances. vacrffy lied
in order to dcfiimc her character. In
the suit. Leibowitr. demands judge-
ment in the amount of $I00.000.

After Lcibowitr's suit was filed.
vaerffy filed an answer and
coitntursuit for $250000. in which he
deities cvery tillegatidn filed against
iii m, only admitting that some ofthc
quotes attributed to hitn were true.

Szoverffy's suit goes on to point
the finger away from himself in the
final responsibility for handling the
case: “Atty liability which may exist
lies against the ultimate decision-
miikcrs within tlic State University
of New York at Albany ttnd not
against defendant [Slovcrffy] who
was without any power to mttkc nor
participate in the ultimate decisions
about which plaintiff [Leibowitl]
complains."

Slovcrffy also says iii his defense
that on April 7. I975. l.cibowit‘1.
published a 40-pttgc statement which
sltowcd malice towards him. In that
statement. Lcihowitr. outlined her
view of the case. which included

charges that vacrffy "has not
demonstrated tltc most clcmcntal
professional courtesy." Szovcrffy
Inbcllcd Lcibowitz's statement “false
and defamatory."

Finally. in his countersuit,
Szovcrffy sued Lcibowiiz for $250.-
000 because he has "suffered great
pain and mental anguish iind has
been irreparany injured in his
profession and professional suin-
ding."

Following these suits. Szoverffy
filed tinothcr suit naming not only
l.cibowitz, but the following as third
party defendants: former Dean of
Humanities Schmidt; former Vice
President for Academic Affairs
Sirotkin; and former SUNYA
Presidents Bcnctct and Fields. This
suit was also in the amount of5250.-
(I00.

Lcibowitr. replied by rcfiling her
suit for 5250.000. and naming the
some third party defendants along
with Slovcrffy. Asa result, Szoverf-
ly is listed as defendant and plaintiff
in the same suit.

In tlic new suit. Lcibowitr. claims
