Ex Comp Lit Prof Files Suits

by MJ. Memmoti

Suits naming the SUNY Bottrd of
Trustees ttnd vuriotis SUNYA tid-
ininistrtitors hitvc been filed in State
Supreme Court by former SUNYA
Compttriitivc Litcrttture Professor
Judith Leibnwitz.

the suits revolve around the
tenure proceedings of Leibowitz in
the lute 1074 and early 1975. which
one former Coinpttrtttive literature
protessor tcrmcd iili “ctnbtiritssing
mess“ for the administration. The
main dcicndnnt iii the Leibowitl
suits is former Compurtitivc
literature ('littit'mttn Joseph
S/mcrtfy. Srnverft'y. now employed
iii Washington l).(.‘.. was llIL‘ Chiiir-
tntiii of the department when
Luihowit/ L‘illIiL‘ up for tenure in
December of I974.

Also named iii the slots are former
SUNY Cliiincclior lirncst Boyer:
i'urniur SUNYA Presidents Louis
Bette/ct illitl Emmett Fields: former
SUNYA Vice President of Academic
Ali'nirs Phillip Sirotkin: and former
l)t'ttn ol llumiinitics Ruth Schmidt.

llic lirst of these suits was filed by

Leibowitl iigtiinst Slovcrffy alone.
in the suit. she chtirges thtit Szoverf—
l‘y was notified by SUNYA as to the
rules and procedures of the various
sttigcs in the tenure process. itnd that
be ignored these rules “by reason of
his malicious and wanton intent to
prevent the plaintiff [Leibowitz]
from obtaining continuing itppoint-
ment.“ Leihowitv also contends thttt
Sloveri‘t'y knew tliut if she were not
granted tenure. she would lose her
job zit SUNYA.

Leibowiil, chitrgcs that. lit connec-
tion with the first department
meeting held to consider her ciin-
didncy for lcnurc.Sroverify failed to
notify her of the dtite of the meeting;
prevented the member of tiic dcpttrt-
mom with the most knowledge of her
work from attending: did not notify
the student representative until three
months later; failed to give deptirt-
merit members specifications of the
procedures to he followed: did not
supply tiny untilysis oi student
cvttlutttions; ttndcrriited n book she
hiid written and did not provide her
file to members of the department or

herself; and threatened her with
rcpristtls if she pursued efforts to ob-
ttiin another departmental review of
her ctisc.

She went on to state in the suit
that following the meeting. Szoverf-
fy sent his recommendations in ii
letter which was deliberately
prcdntcd to “creittc the impression
that the ctindidiitc's request fora new
meeting was too ltitc." Leibowitr
contends that ii rcqucsi she made fox
it new meeting was \vcll within the
time limit.

As the tenure process moved
through various levels. Leibowitl
contends. Sloverffy continued to
"deliberately iind maliciously under-
mine the process." She clitirgcs than
he removed documents from her
dossier. and inserted t'rtiudulcnt
ones, Lcibnwit/ also claims that
S/ovcrffy sought rcvcicws oi her
book from people subject to his iti-
tiuciicc. and then denied hiiving
done so.

in addition. she charges S/overi‘fy
with intimidating members of cont-
mutccs considering her candidacy.

SA Delays Stipend Payments

by Matthew Cox

Although guidelines for iin SAsti-
pend iilloctition procedure were
passed almost two months ago.
lenders of SA-iunded groups who
iirc seeking stipends still haven‘t
received any money.

Delays iti appointing people to n
iiinc~mcmbcr stipend committee.
which determines who will get
stipends and how much will be given.
were attributed in by SA officials itt
putt to confusion over when the
committee was to start operating.

Guidelines for the establishment
of it stipend committee - part of ii
plan to make SA stipend policy
cletircr » were passed by Ccntrtti
Council on Oct. 14.

Central Council Chairman Mike
Lissncr said the final appointments
to the committee will probably go
before Central Council for approval

SA President David (iold. who
appoints one member of the cunt-
mittcc. released ii memorandum
yesterday giving the names of the
four persons nominated by the SA
Executive Committee. Five other
appointments have already been zip-
proved.

(iold sitid the nominations weren't
initdecttrlicr because he had been un-
der the impression that the com-
mittee wouldn‘t be formed until next
semester.

Central Council member Abbie
Havkins. who chairs the SA Internal
Affairs Committee that developed
the guidelines. acknowledged that
the committee formation had been
"very slow."

“We may have been neglectful in
not putting a time limit on when the
committee had to be formed."

Under the guidelines, each of tlic
lottr members of the SA Executive
Committee chooses studentstn serve
on the stipend committee.

Lissner said the committee will
seek applications from those seeking
stipends iii the remaining weeks of
school. and review those
applications over intersession.

“The stipend committee itself
should meet within a week or two
after the semester starts." he said.

Students who littvc worked on
organizations this semester must
seek their stipends retroactively.
Lissncr said.

The SA Budget Committee last
semester removed all stipend
allocations from the SA budget.

Former SUNVA Vice President at Academic Aft-ire Phillip Slroiklntl
among those administrator: nomad In the lawsuits invoiving tenure
proceedings in the Comparative Literature Department.

Finally. she asserts that Sloverffy
threatened to sue the SUNYA ud-
niinistrtttion in an effort to prevent
them front taking an impartial look
tit licr candidacy.

Leibowitz goes on to 5in that in
numerous instances. Srovcri‘fy tied
in order to dcfzinic her character. iii
the suit. Lcibowitr. dcmnnds judge-
ment in the amount of $100.000.

After Lcibowitz‘s suit was filed,
vacrffy filed tin answer rind
countcrtiuit for 3250.000. in which he
denies every tilicgtttidh filed against
him. only admitting that some ofthc
quotes attributed to him were true.

Slovcrffy‘s suit goes on to point
the ﬁnger away from himself in the
final responsibility for handling the
case: “Any liability which may exist
lies against the ultimate decision-
makers within the State University
of New York at Albany and not
against defendent [Sloverffy] who
was without any power to make nor
participate in the ultimate decisions
about which plaintiff [Leibowitr]
complains.“

Szoverffy also says in his defense
that on April 7. i975. Leibowitz
published a 40-pagc statement which
showed malice towards him. In that
statement. Leibowitz outlined her
view of the case. which included

charges that Srovcrffy “has not
demonstrated the most elemental
prolessionul courtesy." Szovcrffy
labelled Leibowitz‘s sttttcmcnt “false
ttnd defamatory.“

Finally. in his couiitcrsuit.
Stovcrft'y sued Leibowitz for $250.-
000 because he has "suffered great
piiiti iind mental anguish and has
been irrepitrtibly injured in his
profession and professional sitin-
ding."

Following these suits. Szovcrf‘fy
filed another suit naming not only
Leibowitz. but the following asthird
piirty defendants: former Detin of
Humanities Schmidt; former Vice
President for Academic Affairs
Sirotkin; and former SUNYA
Presidents Benezet and Fields. This
suit was also iii the amount of$250.-
000.

Lcibowitz replied by refiling her
suit for $250,000. and ntitning the
same third party defendants along
with Szovcrft'y. Asa result. Slovcrf-
i'y is listed as defendant and plaintiff
in the same suit.

In the new suit. Leibowitz claims
that “third-ptirty defendant Ruth
Schmidt. Phillip Sirotkin. Louis
