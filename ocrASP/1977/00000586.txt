Plans for a weekend restaurant
and evening entertainment bus are
now underway. The Friday and
Saturday evening shuttle would
provide transportation for students
to-local nightspots. -

Central. Council Chairman
Michael Lissncr. who is working on
the bus project. said that approval by
the Finance Committee of the Cen-
tral Council and a final agreement
on the bus contract with Yankee
Trails are needed before the service
can begin.

The weekend bus shuttle would
run hourly from 9:30 p.m. to 2:30
a.m. making a loop fromthe uptown
campus to Stuyvesant Plaza. to the
downtown bars as far as Lark Street.
up Central Avenue and back to cam-
pus by way of Fuller Road.

Lissncr said that the bus service is
being planned to facilitate student's
travelling to off~campus entertain-
ment places. particularly the ones
not serviced by the regular bustine.

“There‘s also a safety factor in-
volved." said Lissncr. “The bus
would give people an alternative to
driving during the winter months

»“very enthusiastic“ about the shuttle

obtaining the initial ttppropriatiun
from Central Council. the service
would begin on an experimental
basis early in the spring scrtteslcr.

Because Yanl.ee Trails proposed
lower rates for tie special entertain-
ment bus route. Lissncr is otl'cring

CDTA.

when the roads are bad."

The proposed bus service will be
funded wholly or in part by the es-
tablishments serviced by the bus
runs. Those restaurants and bars'
would pay for the transportation to
their doors by buying adver-
tisements on campus and in ASP.

Lissncr said that any deficit could
be made by the bus riders. paying
perhaps to cents or 25 cents for an
evening‘s transportation.

“I think we can break even
without having to charge the riders."
said Lissncr. “I‘m pretty sure we can
get all of our funding from the
businesses." According to Lissncr.

A spokesman for Yankee Trails
said that a tentative service arrange-
ment has been made. which would
provide both Friday and Saturday
night service for $l37.50.

According to Lissncr CDTA gave
a ballpark ﬁgure of Sl80.00-200.00
for the same services.

Lissncr said that the ﬁnal contract
would be sent to Yankee Trails this
week. Then, said Lissncr. pending

PICK-HIT

The Trade Publication
Cashbox is predicting that the sound-
track from the movie “Close En-
counters of the Third Kind“ may
yield a multitude of hit records.

The "Close Encounters" theme is
based on a simple series of musical
notes which scientists pick up on
radio-telescopes. In the lilm, the
notes turn out to be signals broad-
cast from deep space by ex-
traterrestrial beings.

In the course of the movie. the
notes are transformed into an
“lntcrplanetary language“ which
becomes imprinted on the minds of
persons hearing the alien signal.

Cashbox‘s prediction of a hit
could be accurate. since the “Close
Encounters" sound track was com-
posed by John williams. the same
person who wrote the score i'or“Star
Wars" and for "Jaws".
“Star Wars“ theme became a big-
sclling record.

55$ WITHDRAWN

The Dow Chemical Company has
withdrawn itsi‘intincial suppon from
Central Michigan University as a
result ol a recent speech on that came
pus delivered by Jane Fonda.

Dow‘s President. in a letter to the
University. said that his company
objected to the payment of a 53.500
speaker's fee to someone who, in
Dow‘s words. "advocates the
overthrow oi our country." The
Dow letter also characterized I‘ondti
as "an avowed communist sym-
pritltirer."

The University has estimated that
Dow has been providing about $70.-
tltlt) in linancial aid annually to Cen-
tral Michrgrin.

Fonda had used her address to
Iambust what she claimed was a lack
oi morality and rcsponsibilityontltc
part of her most major corporv
tattoos. She said at one point: “We
have a new body of rulers; tyrants
whose names you don‘t know and
laces you don‘t recogni/c. btil who
control your lrle.“

Fonds" has responded to Dow’s
letter labelingl it?" .“a resurrec-
tion of McCa'rth'y-stylc red- *
baiting." In addition. she bat
accepted a student invitation to
debate Dow representatives on cam-
pus. -

Dow. however. isn't interested. A
Dow official told “Her Say"
Women's News service last week
that Dow has no plans. either now or
in the future, to debate actress Jane
Fonda.

CAUGHT It CAGED

Two hundred or more illegal -

aliens at one time are routinely held
at a government warehouse designed
to hold only 80 prisoners.
The Los Angeles Times says they are
crowded into small quarters. after
being apprehended by the US Im-
migration Service.

The Times reports aliens waiting
to be "voluntarily" deported to
Mexico. are held for up to six hours
in a chain-link enclosure recently
constructed inside a government
warehouse in Bell. California. The
facility. which The Times says often
houses 200 or more dcportccs. has
only seats and toilet facilities for 80
persons.

The newspaper describes the
enclosure as being like “A Large
Cage" which has neither air con-
ditioning nor heating. in which it-
legal aliens of both sexes are forced
to use opcn toilets.

The Times quotes an immigration
Service oll'icial. l’hil smith. as ex-
plaining: “A man can tolerate it fora
I'cw hours...most of these are hearty
people. We ﬁnd that the aliens
themselves don‘t mind it a bit."
