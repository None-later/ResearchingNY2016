To the Eﬂor.

I would like to comment on your Friday
article concerning my parking ticket ‘odyssey‘

complicated story is condensed. a few
inaccuracies crept through.

Firm of 2.1L 1 do not believe that my current
tickets should be intalidated bemuse the first
one was; rather. l believe that the ﬁrst appeal
was accepted for the wrong reasons. ones
which sidestepped the legal issue. According
to every in l have found (including Mr.
“'illrarns‘ erenccsl. all of my tickets are
rm alid and it‘s merely a bothersome
procedure to legally confirm this. albeit one
that apparently must be seen through.

Secondly. my car is no“ registered: it just
wasn't when the “31115 Ken issued.

i didn‘t completely understand the section

To the Lditor.

i am a student in Humanities ISO: 
C uliural Diversity and the Human Condition.
When i initially read the description for this
course i felt it would be worthwhile to include
ii in my schedule. I enrolled in lSOb last
semester and was very satisfied Willi two
segments of the program. On the other hand.
the portion on Guatemala “as highh
disorganized with no continuity uhatsoewl
and i doubt that ll was a learning experience
for anyone in the class. Although this class
1;: ‘kcd in seieral areas l was told that lSOavius
a valuable course and due to the fact that I had
a sincere interest in the three culture areas
oliered l enrolled in the course for this
semester

it is not more than halfway into the semester
and i am totally disillusioned With the
iiumanitia department and its organization
of this coune. The first segment included
drummed facts and myths about Franmthail
was unable to make any logical sense out of.
After studying for the cum and completing
all the reading .ixSignments i this gn en tut-l:

In: second portion in llzc course included

approximately seven lectures and the net: told
on October l4 that our exam would be gncn
on October 28 and that we had three books to
rwd in that time span. Actually . it was
unnecessary to do any work for this segment
of the course because the exam turned out to
be a three ring circus. There were not enough
tests available. only half the class had pencils.
and discussion and sharing of answers “as
allowed by the proctor: during the exam.

it is very disheartening to know that I am
here for an upper level education yci am
experiencing primary level training and
instruction in this particular course. i will me
credit to several professors intolycd in‘lhe

subject matter they are teaching. but on ihc

who have been subjected to it two hour wait

particularly maddening when the curd

the library and the computer does not show it

I hereby propose three controversial
methods to cut down on the unexplained but
well-known cause of book disappearance:

l. implement professional doormcn, not
students. to check all books. bricfcascs.
handbags. backpacks. ctc. — in addition to
the electronic device in use. Students cannot,
nor will not. supervise their peers.

2. Close the stacks to all but it privileged

3. Rc-implcmcnt a strict ftnc system so than

No doubt. these proposals will meet \vitlt

Board Games

A student is about to be thrown off the UAS Board of Directors; it
seems that Student Association inadvertently forgot to appoint a
graduate student to the board.

Of course, it only seems that way —-— there’s actually quite a bit of
politicking going on here. The by-laws of UAS, Inc. don’t specify that
there be both undergrads and grads on the board of directors, only that
the directors be chosen from among the undergrads and grads on the
membership board.

So UAS is presently not in violation of its by-laws. But the one grad
student on the membership board has complained that his constituency
is not adequately represented on the board of directors, which is true.
The way to correct this, however, is not to impeach one of the duly
nominated and elected undergrads. it’s simply an unforgivetible
oversight on the part of the SA president, and one that should be
corrected with the selection of next year‘s board.

Then why the sudden rush to play musical board members? Of the
eleven student directors, two have demonstrated their unwillingness to
mindlessly follow the dictates of their president and vote with the
“student block.“ Two out of eleven is enough to substantially affect the
solid voting majority of the student caucus. And that majority is
necessary if the board is to institute progressive reforms like the quarter
can of Coke.

The complaint of grad student Bryant Monroe, then, is a convenient
excuse for the removal of dissident undergrad Leslie Snyder. Another
interesting question: why Snyder, and not fellow dissident Jon Hodges?
After till. Hodges has compiled a far superior record of dissidence, and is
without question better qualified for removal.

Well. faced with the difficult choice of which media group to offend.
the ASP or WCDB-FM. SA quite understandably went with the radio
station. since they haven’t even begun to broadcast yet.

This offense is not limited tothc stuff of WCDB; the childish internal
bickerings of the “student caucus" is an offense to every student at this.
university.

in their relentless quest for Student Power. SA has lost sight ofthcir
objective. Student Power does not mean the ability to dictate policy
without interference; it does not mean blind obedience to the whims oi
one student lcrtdcr. Student power is the product of respect. from
faculty. administrators and especially from other students; and of the
unobstructed ﬂow of divergent opinions from all segments of the
university.

It‘s enough that SUNYA has to endure Moscovian winters; it
shouldn‘t be forced to weather their politics. too.
