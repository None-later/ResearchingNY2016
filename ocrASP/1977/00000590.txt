In the past. the ASP has tried to iron out matters involving ASP policies
outside the pages of the university newspaper. A few recent developments
warrant exceptions to this rule.

With the advent of Season Ticket. a newsletter geared toward publicizing
women‘s sports at SUNYA. the ASI’ sports department has come under
attack for underplaying the role of female athletes here. The few women's
articles which are accepted. Alice Reagan writes. arc hacked to pieces to
make room for three-day old NFI. statistics.

Firstly, the sports editor has been actively seeking \\ riters to cover women's
5purts since the first ASI’ intcrcst mcctirig three months ago. Ol the dozen
prospective writers at that meeting . only two expressed a desire to write
about women‘s learns.

Merc physical limitations prevent him from covering cvcrysport himself;
he must depend on volunteers. He cannot order anyone to eovcra women‘s
volleyball game any more than he can order someone to report on men‘s
soccer. The glamour of seeing one‘s own byline in print is not enough
incentive to make our writer 5 indentured servants ~ we can only request
that they cover a certain story. and if they refuse. we can only look for
someone else.

Secondly. the articles that are printed arc sliced to the same degree as any
sports article. with the same critcrion. The editing is done for clarity-sake
only. not for the sole purpose of insuring that a certain article he kept
proportionally short in length.

And ﬁnally. the nature of NFL scheduling is such that three-day old and.
and even five-day old, standings are relevant as one-day old standings. That‘s
the convenience of playing 92 percent of the games on one day.

The women‘s gymnastics season opcns today, and women‘s basketball
began their regular season on Saturday. We invrtc. in tact. Iltipltlrl: writers to
cover these and all women's athletics at SUNYA tor the ASP. (‘oinc to
CC329. or call 457-2I‘l4. and we'll givc you a season ticket.

A powerful McGill University
swim team defeated the Albany
State womcns team. 93-43, Saturday
afternoon in the University pool.
The Canadian team captured first
place in all events except the diving.

However. the meet was not a dis-
appointment. aecording to Albany
Coach. Jackie (iillis. The 4—2
Canadians \vcrc expected to win
c\crything in sight. so (illlis used the
meet to experiment with her team‘s
strengths and weaknesses. She used
girls in competitions they do not nor-
mally participate in. giving them an
opportunity to swim in different
types of races.

Mc(iill took an early lead in the
match. swimming to four con-
secutive victories. Lois Moreljo.

ponent in the ZOO-yard individual
medley. taking the victory by 20
seconds.

Despite the overwhelming odds.
Albany made a tremendous effort
and swam some very fine races.

"i used to be too
uncomfortable to do
much of anything when I
had my menstrual
period. It was like losing
at least three days every
month. Then, last year, i
switched to Tarnan
tampons. Now I’m
always on the go.”

Making every day
count is what 'l‘amprix
tampons are all about
They eliminate (hating.
bulk and bulges. In for i,
once the tampon is prop-
erly in place, you can’t
even feel it's thorn.

And Tampax
tampons are uniquer
designed to conform to
individual vaginal con—
tours. Which means
there’s less chance of
eakage or bypass.

With Tampax
tampons you get a lot
more days out of the
year. And a lot more fun
out of life.

DECEMBER 8. 1977

Women swimmers DroWned 

tough race against two strong
McGill,contcnders. swimming with
them stroke for stroke. eventually
losing her bid for second place hyin-
chcs.

In the lilo-yard and SOyard
butterfly competitions. Albany
swimmers were defeated by fractions
of a second. Kim 'l'liuon and Cooke
of McGill were the sole participants
in the IOU-yard ﬂy. The pair swam
together wall to wall, but Cooke
came up with a strong last effort to
win the race in the final few feet.

Kathy Barry exerted tremendous
effort in the 50-yard fly, an event
she does not usually compete in.
Barry‘s forte is freestyle. but she
proved herself a versatile swimmer
by taking a close second inthe race.

later in the meet. once again takings
very close second, this time losingby
only four tenths of a second.

,The Albany diving combination
of Suzy Fontrier‘ and Charlene
Griswold triumphed once more in
the diving competitions. Griswold
took ﬁrst place honors in the re-
quired event. which seems to be an
established routine for her. She was
the only diver for the optional com-
petition and performed well on the
three-meter board.

quired cvcnt taking second place.
Fontrierdid a rcvcrsedive in the pike
position and was scored well by the
judges.
