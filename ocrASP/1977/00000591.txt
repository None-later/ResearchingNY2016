84-27 In Sensati’s Debut

by Mitch Chlitln

in a spectacular showing of _

strength last Saturday the Albany
State Men's swim team opened its
season sinking McGill University“.
27. The Danes captured all but two
first place finishes while breaking
three school records and one pool
record.

The 400-yiird medley relay team of
Bill Stockwell, Joe Shore. Bob
Gonzenbach. and Mike Dwyer got
the meet off to a good start for
Albany by winning in a time of
4:014.

The only two events Albany didn't
come in ﬁrst were the l000-yard and
the ZOO-yard freestyle races with
Dave Rubin and Dwyer coming in
second in those races. respectively.

Steve Rchfuss. a triple winner.
then began his reign of terror on
Albany's record board. He swam the
50-yard freestyle in 22.6 and the lot)-
yard freestyle in 5I.l both new school
records. Rehfuss was also a member

of the winning 400-yard freestyle
relay team. ' v

Stockwell, Albany's second triple
winner of the day, won the Myard
individual medley in a time of 2: 14.6.
He also won the ZOO-yard
backstroke in a time of 2:229.

A new school and pool record was
.set by Gonzenbach in the ZOO-yard
butterfly. with at 2200.4 clocking.
This time misses the qualifying time
for the nationals by one tenthofa se-
cond (qualifying: 2:003) and
Coach Ron White is sure Gonzen-
bllcil will easily go under two
minutes and swim in the nationals.

Co-captain Rubin swam at 5225.5
winning the 500 yard freestyle and
was it member of the winning 400
freestyle relay team.

Shore. another double winner.
