a successful beginning to the l977-78
season. For Cortland, their second

straight loss.

Coach Sauers had mixed feelings
about the win. “I'm always happy
with a win." said Sauers. “However.
I wouldn‘t say it was an artistic

effort."

Artistic it wasn‘t. The game.
somwhat lethargic at times, saw
Albany turn the ball over 23 times
while the Red Dragons gave it uplS

leading scorer of last year. Jim
Stank. took an early 2-0 lead right
from the tap as forward Vince
Gaetani hit on a IS-foot jump shot.

Albany center Barry Cavanaugh
gave the Danes their first two points
of the season with an easy layup to
tie the score at two.

For the next ten minutes both
teams traded baskets with Gaetani
and Albany‘s Kevin Keane doing
much of the scoring. Keane. the
Danes‘ captain. scored seven straight
points to put Albany ahead 9-8.

Both teams exchanged baskets with
Albany holding a 12-point lead most

the Danes began playing sloppily.
For three and a half mintttes. the
Danes couldn‘t buy a basket.

Cortland. however. wasn‘t doing
much to help their own cause. Cor~

with l 1 minutes to go to give Albany a

Extended Library Hours In Danger

by Peter Nadel

The extension of University
Library hours during finals week
may be it bygone practices after this
semester. according to Library
Director C. James Sehmidt._

Schmidt said that there will be an
active monitoring of the usage of
library facilities during ﬁnals week
to determine whether the library will
extend hours in the future.

According to Schmidt. there is
reason to believe that the use of total
library resources during this time
period is not sufficient to kcep lltt.’
facility open.

"We‘re trying to dctctminc." stittl
Schmidt. “ti hethcr the library Will be
used as a library or merely as it stttd y
hall, and the extend of sticli use."

A report of the results of this
survey will be made to the Library
Council of the University Senate.

Some of the prime areas that will
be focused upon in the survey arethe
number of books checked out. the
amount of use that the periodical
and reserve collections draw. and the
degree of assistance required by
students and supplied by library
personnel.

if the statistics obtained show that
these areas are not being utilired by
significant numbers of students than
\‘climidt said he would like to see
sortie alternative sttidying
environments explored.

“We‘re trying to see whether the
category of activities we see us

that if this isn‘t found. he will
"impliciter argue that study only
can indeed bedone in other places on
campus."

The Library is a very complicated
and important resource and we do it
an injustice in seeing it as a study
hall." said Schmidt.

The survey. which was called for
by the Library Council last spring.
will determine. whether student
demand of Library resources is
sufficient to justify the added
expense. which amounts to an
additional two hundred-seventy
personnel hours.

Alternative areas which may be
used in lieu of the library may
include lecture centers. cafeterias. or
the student‘s own dormitory rooms.

“it‘s obviously absurd." said SA
President Dave Gold. “many, many
students need the resources of the
Library dtiritig this time for term
papers and other types of work."

Schmidt said the emphasis that
the extended library hours and the
University as a whole puts oti finals
weeks is an "unsound educational
policy." He said that “we must try
and build activities around every
week of instruction and concentrate
on ritit making finals week the only
importaiit week of the semester.“
