New English major requirements
wereapproved by the University
Senate on Monday. 1

The changes are part of a two-year
effort by the SUNYA English
Department to create a more
structured degree program.
according to Director of the
Undergraduate Program in English
William Dumbleton.

Dumbleton said that the major
will still require 36creditsin English.
The new requirements differ,
however. in that an English major
must now take at least one course
from each of the revised course
groupings. These include writing.
criticism and linguistics, literature.
genre. author. topical. and period
courses.

Presently. the only additional
requirement is that students take I2
credits at the upper division level.

According to University Senate
Chairperson Donald Bishko. the

proposal passed by voice vote with
little opposition. If approved by
SUNYA President Vincent O'Leary.
the new requirements will become
effective for freshmen in the Fall
1978 semester.

Dumbleton said the new program
“will still allow the student major to
have freedom of selection and an
enormous amount of flexibility. but
now we can be sure that the major's
36 credit hours will include a breadth
of experience with literature."

According to English Deparment
Chairman John Gerber, the
loosening up of requirements in the
major begain in the late l960‘s and
early l970's when academic
programs in most universities placed
emphasis on freedom and flexibility.

Gerber said that, in the last few
years. faculty and students have
expressed the need for increased
guidance and more speciﬁc req uire-
ments within the Department.

Dumbleton said that two years

 May Irnpose Requirements

ago the English Department
surveyed recent English major
graduates-who now work in such
fields as publishing. personnel
management. advertising. and
technical writing-to determine how
satisfied they were with theirtraining
at SUNYA. The Department then
began a complete review of the
curriculum and courses.

Under the new program, courses
will be renumbered and re-
organized. Dumbleton said. Some
additional courses will also be
offered. Courses that have proven
themselves popular. such as the
Science Fiction course. are being
incorporated into a general interest
subgroup to attract non-majors.
said Dumbleton.

The new requirements also apply
to English majors who have a
concentration in the Teacher
Education Program. These students
must take at least one linguistics
course also.

No Penalty to Break Dorm Contract ‘

by Denise Lencl

Students can break their on-
campus housing contracts for next
semester without being penalized the
equivalent of eight weeks dorm rent,
according to Director of Residences
John Welty.

An open release period beginning
Monday. Dec. l2 atid ending Friday.
Dec. l7. will free up housing spaceto
mcet ati anticipated enrollment
increase in the spring semester.
Welty said.

' Freshmen Cause

Freshmen and transfer students
arriving in January are expected to

cause the increase, he said.

Students already attending
SUNYA will be given preference as
rooms are assigned, Welty said.
About sixty students who sought on-
campus housing at the beginning of
the semester were housed at the
Country Squire Motel in
Guildcrland becausedorm space was
filled. Other students looking for a
place to live had been referred to the
llotle Wellington downtown until it
became ﬁlled.

An open release policy is
instituted only when a large demand
for dormitory housing is expected.

SUNYA Coffee House

Ihe curtains may be lowered at
SUNYA's Free/e-I)ried Coffee
H ousc for the last time this weekend.
lltit SA officials. in tin unrelated
decision. are considering opening a
Wine anti cheese cafe iii the Spring.

Coffee House Chairman Alan
Siltcrmttn. who was reluctant to give
an explanation for the anticipated
closing. said Iic has spread the word
among patrons that the Coffee
IIoUsc will probably not rc-open in
January.

Silvcrtnan said waning interest
had been a part of the reason for the
tentative decision to close. The
Coffee House. which is funded
largely by SA and depends on
volunteers. has reportedly had
difficulty finding students willing to
work.

Losing Interest

"Interest has definitely ehbcd.”
Silicrmtin said. “We see that as a
sign. and this [closing] is our
answci."

Plans for starting a wine and
cheese place in the Campus t'ctitei

the expected Coffee House closing
became known. according to SA
President Dave (iold. The new
venture. which would be funded by
SA. and UAS. might offer live
entertainment similar to that at the
Coffee House.
Few Carry Burden

David Milllllcll. who worked at
the Coffe House last year. said he
quit because the btirdcn of'running it
kept falling on the shoulders ofu few
organi/crs.

"Alan's told me it's been worscthis
year." Mtilltich said. “When it got
like that last year. ljust said the hell
with it,“ Mallach said he believed the
Coffee House was definitely closing.
but that he had also heard an
increase in volunteers recently might
have changed these plans. Silverniaii
couldn't be reached last nigltl.

A new cafe. according to UAS
lloard President Paul i‘cldman.
would hire waiters and waitresses.
thus avoiding the problem of
depending on volunteers, Feldman.
who said he was stirpri. at learning
of the Coffee Houses expected
closing. said he didn't think a similar

Welty said. Earlier this semester. a
release period resulted in more
women leaving campus than men.
According to Welty. some female
suites may be consolidated to create
more housing for males next
semester.

Students who are seeking a release
from their housing contract must fill

venture would meet with the same
fate.

"I don‘t think the Freeze-Dried
Coffee House has had problems
drawing people." he said. “I go there
and it hasn‘t been empty.“

Silvcrman. who at first was reluc-
tant to speak. refused to go into
details of the closing. “We‘re not
looking to revive interest." he said.
“We‘re really not interested in that."

SA Controller Mike Hctchkop
has said the Coffee House. which
gets about $7.000 in SA funding. has
not been having financial
difficulties.

However. because of retrench—
ment. faculty lines were cut in several
departments resulting in fewer
teachers in those departments in
1977 than in 1975.

“In a period of retrctichment there
is still hiring because ofretiremcnts."
said Sabai. "We must mtike a
concerted effort to recruit women
and minorities and to develop people
already here so that they will hecotne

According to Sabai. recruiting
women and minorities for SUNYA's
graduate progratns is a significant
step toward correcting the
imbalance of l’hl)‘s. and will
increase the number of qualified
women candidate for faculty
positions.

According to Director of

and women candidates." The
personnel office provides
information about journals and
media where an advertisement
announcing a vacancy would attract
minority and women candidates.

Sabai. who worked previously in
the affirmative action office of Kent
State University. said “Most of the
women and minority candidates
who applied did not see thejob offer
through a journal. They saw it
through a direct contact with the
department. by being recommended
by someone in the department. or by
an expert in the field."

According to the Title IX report.
of the 856 civil service employees of
the university in I976. 49 per cent
were men and Si per cent were
women. The report states that
Women are over represented in the
for/er grttde jobs titid that virtually
all women have positions in
traditionally feminine occupations
such as typists and stenographers.

There scents to he no afﬁrmative
action plan to employ men in these
traditionally female positions.
lioweter, “I've heard it facetious
comment that the only way to get
men into women's fields is to raise
the salaries.“ Sabat said. “There is
actitally a shortage of secretaries
now because women are moving tip.
As far as any specific corrective
action taken to get men into those
fields goes. I don‘t know of any."
