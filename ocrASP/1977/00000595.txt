HEALTH HAZARD

I “Maehismo‘ is reportedly haters

dons to your health.

The publication Science News
says two medical researchers have
found that men are less healthy than
women. The researchers. Charles
and Mary Ann Lewis, have conclud-
ed that this difference in health is
largely caused by the “sex roles“
males are encouraged to emulate. ‘

According to the Lewises. male
children are encouraged to endure
hardship and pain and, in their
words. "by six years of age. males
perceive themselves to be less
vulnerable or susceptible than
females of the same age."

Thess “Macho” feelings, accor-
ding to the researchers. cause men to
seek medical help less often than
women. As a result. the Lewises say.
men have many more chronic dis-
cases and die sooner than women.

READ UP

Top-secret federal court papers.
detailing in simple language how
terrorists could use plutonium to
poison everyone inside New York's
World Trade Center. have acciden-
tally been available to the public for
the past two years.

The New York Post reports that
the scientific papers were included in
ii thick folder in a public documents
room of a New York courthouse.
l'hc top-secret reports were sup-
posed to be sealed by court order.
but apparently were placed acciden-
tally in the wrong files where the
public could easily read them.

[he papers were prepared as part
of a suit lilcd two years ago by New
York State engineers. lihc reports
explained how terrorists could take
minute amounts ol'stolcit plutonium
and then enter specific ventilation
towers of the World lradc Center
and poison the air. About 6400 peo-
ple work in thc Iriidc Center

 

building each day.

The papers outline one method for
building. a home-made atomic’
bomb. The Post reports that a’
federal judge has now sealed the
documents. and has requested an in-
vestigation into what went wrong. '

SNAP. CRACKLE...

For whatever it‘s worth, British
medical experts have ﬁnally deter-
mined what makes knuckles crack.

The Los Angeles Times reports
that a team of British doctors rigged
up a ﬁnger-stretching machine and
took high-speed x-ray pictures of 17
students who volunteered to have
their knuckles cracked.

The doctors discovered that when
the two bones of a linger-joint wer
pulled apart. a thin ﬂuid moved into
the gap. A low-pressure situation
then resulted. which caused bubbles
to form and then collapse. The
collapse was the popping orcracking
sound.

ODD COUPLE

the Center for UFO studies
reports it is looking into a strange
"flying saucer“ abduction case in
which a young Kansas couple and
their baby were reportedly taken
aboard a space craft and examined
by humanoid-like beings.

The Evanston. Illinois. research
group says that the incident has
quietly been under intensive study
since its reported occurancc last
December near (ioodland. Kansas,
The rcascarchcrs report that this
case is strikingly similar to what is
reported to have happened [7 years
ago in the much publicilcd Betty and
Barney |li|| case.

In the latest case. the couple is
identified by the Center only as

"Joe" and “Carol” and their four-
month-old son’ Luke. The
researchers say that under hypnosis,
the couple recalls being stopped in
their car along a Kansas
highway after nightfall and being
taken aboard a large saucer-shaped
craft about 30 feet high and ISO feet
wide.

Both Joe and Carol recall being
examined in separate rooms by
beings of nearly average height.
dressed in metallic clothes that
resemble small “tubes” wrapped
around their bodies.

The entities are reported to have
had large skull-shaped heads, large
foreheads. no hair.large deep-set
eyes and no apparent mouths. The
creatures reportedly communicated
quickly and easily with Joe and
Carol through mental telepathy.

The couple reportedly could not
recall any of their two-hour ex-
perience aboard the craft until they
underwent hypnosis. They said later
they found painless puncture marks
and discoloration on parts of their
bodies shortly after the incident. ap-
parently caused by instruments used
on them during a physical examina-
tion aboard the craft.

the couple is quoted by the Center
as recalling that one thing that im-
pressed them about the beings was
the entities‘ deep sense of
"pcaccfulncss,"

LONG-PLAYING

The group Flcetwood Mac has
learned that all good things must
come to an end somtimc.

For the lirst time in more than half
a year. the group's big-sellingalbum.
"Rumours," is no longer topping the
charts in all three major record trade

 

publications.

This week‘s edition of Cashbox
ranks, Linda Ronstadt's new album.
“Simple Dreams," ahead of
“ Rumours,“ marking the ﬁrst time in
28 weeksthat the Fleetwood Mac LP
has dropped from the number on'e'
listing.

' Both Billboard and Record
World. however. still rank
"Rumours" in the top position.
"Rumours" is believed to have sold
about seven million copies.

SOMETHING FISHY

Environment magazine reports
that seafood. mostly shrimp. which
is too contaminated to pass US.
Government inspection. is often sold
as salvage by dealers, rather than be-
ing destroyed as is required by US.
law.

The seafood is then taken to Mex-
ico. the magazine says. where it is
simply repackaged. labeled
“Product of Mexico." and shipped
back to the US. Environment says
that because US. border inspectors at
the U.S.-Mexican border make only
spot checks. the treated seafood has
a good chance of getting across the
border.

The magazine reports that if the
spoiled seafood has deteriorated too
much for this tactic to work. it is
treated with bleached chemicals and
sometimes even sprayed with a mor-
tician‘s chemical used to dcodorizc
decomposing bodies.

Environment says that some rc-
jcctcd shrimp is even l'urthcrdisguis-
cd by cookingand breading. where it
is then shipped in bulk to the US. and
repackaged and labeled "packaged
in the U.S.A."

NO ODOR
A Japanese trading company has
begun marketing what could be an
historic cooking breakthrough.
odorless garlic.
lihc giant Mitsubishi Corporation
rcports it has purchased the world-
wide distribution rights to com-
pletely odorless garlic that was

WORLD WIDE t

The United Nations General
Assembly this month is considering
endorsing an International Draft

Convention on the elimination of _

discrimination against women. _

Before the General Assembly acts.
however. it may have quite a lot of
housecleaning of its own to take care
of.

A recent seminar by the UN'S
Research and Training branch
(Unitar) found that the world body
has very few women in its top
leadership positions.

The study group found that less
than to per cent of the posts at
professional levels at the UN were
held by women at the start of 1976.
Only one of 103 posts as resident
representatives ofthe UN around the
globe was held by a woman as of
January. I977; and no organization
or agency in the UN system was
headed by a woman.

The Unitar study group concluded
that despite the International
Women‘s in I975. and various
resolutions by the General
Assembly. little has been done to end
sex discrimination at the United
Nations.
