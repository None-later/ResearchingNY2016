No Mere Tuition.-
Repealthe Health Fee!

 

by David Gold

Besides the delicious food. prompt bus
service. and lack of bureaucracy at SUNYA.
the main reason students attend this
University is to receive a quality education at
an affordable price. '

The quality of our education has
deteriorated rapidly. Budget cutbacks have
caused a dramatic increase in class size. the
retrenchment of many teachers. the demise of
innovative curricula and programs. and the
elimination of whole departments. (SUNYA
has lost 20 degree programs in the last two
years. the most in the SUNY system.) Totop it
.i ll off. the cost of our education has continued
to increase. Tuition and room rents were
raised $l00 in I975. while TAP and EOP
stipends were cut last year. In other words. we
are paying more and more for less and less.

This year there is a new twist. It is called a
"health fee“. It is a $17 fee on the billing. which
every student must pay. None of the 2.3
million dollars raised by this fee has gone to
health care on any SUNY campus. In fact.
statewide health service staff has been cut ten
percent and SUNY Albany continues to luck
comprehensive gynecological or birth control
care for women (although students are
working very hard on developing a women's
health clinic.)

instead of going towards health service. this
ice is going into the general fund for the state
to use as it sees fit. It is in fact a tuition
increase. yet it is not covered by TAP or the
Regents Scholarship. it is worse than a tuition
increase. in that it was created dishonestly.
When the Board of Trustees ended SUNY‘s
lrec tuition policy in I963. they pledged to use
any money raised by tuition to “eliminate any
infirmary fees.“ This semester. due to student
pressure. the Trustees voted not to include the
health fee in the SUNY budget request for
l978-79.

When the people who make the final

decisions. the Governor and the Legislature.
found out about the Trustees
recommendation. they laughed. Without
constant pressure. the health fee will never by
repealed.

The Student Unionization Movement. in
coordination with the students at SUNY
Genesco. SUNY Brockport. and SASU. is
coordinating a student boycott of this de facto
tuition increase. Other constituencies have
given us their support. The SUNY Faculty
Senate. praised the Trustees in eliminatingthe
health fee from their budget request. and the
Chancellor‘s Task Force on Student Health
service reported that they were “strongly
opposed to a student health fee. ofthe nature
imposed. and to the manner in which it was
imposed." Jack Lester. the Student
Association lawyer. is investigating the
possibility of taking legal action to oppose this
illegal. immoral fee.

The signiﬁcance of this action. goes well
beyond the $8.50 per semester (not that it
would not be nice to have some extra spending
money for the holiday season.) It is important.
in that if we can repeal this fee. it will be the
first time students have ever pressured the
state into lowering the cost of public higher
education. By joining together on this issue.
students. faculty. and parents will show the
State of New York that we will no longer
accept an inferior education at an increased
cost. We will no longer pay more and more for
less and less.

Please sign a pledge card and join the health
fee boycott.

 

 

Tuesday's ASP will be the last
issue of this semester. The next
issue will be published on
January 27. l978.
Letters to the Editor will be due
on January 24.

 

 

need
help?

To the Edltor:

Students here at SUNYA have had more
than their share of problems. Unfortunately.
many of these problems. although legitimate
concerns. have gone unresolved. This is due to
the fact that in the past students have not
found effective means of dealing with their
problems.

In an effort to rectify this situation. the posi-
tion of Student Association Ombudsperson
has been established. The Ombudsperson will
be available to assist students in resolvingthcir
problems by using all the resources Student
Association has available to it.

if you have a problem. stop by the SA 0f-
licc. Campus Center 346. and fill out a
grievance form. Or. you can call the office at
457-6542. A 24 hour complaint line has also
been set up to handle calls at times when the
SA ofﬁce is closed. Simply call 438-8332. say
you would like to leave a message for the Om-
budspcrson. and leave your name and phone
number. You‘ll get contacted as soon as possi-
ble.

"The resources are here to help make your
life here as hassle free as possible. It's up to you
to use them.

election
result

To the Editor:

Who won the Colonial Quad Council
Election?

Students and Administrators talk about the
lack of interest in student government.
Ridiculously small votcturnouts are looked at
with apathetic eyes. The school media is a
major cause of this apathy. The ASP did an
adequate job of covering the first contested
election but did not follow up on this one.

Of course the ASP is not supposed to be a

 

 

btudcnt government spokesman. The ASP is

  

supposed to reflect student's interests. namely
relevant news.

Maybe the ASP does not feel that the
Central Council elections are relevant news. I
doubt that this is the case. If no one elsmhc
350+ people who voted and the hit rd working
candidates who ran. gave a damn about
Colonial Quad.

I will not tell you the outcome ofthc election

- that‘s the ASP‘s job.
