0 the ﬁlter:

As the former class president, 1 ﬁnd myself
ondcring what is going now on my former
has council. 1 read in the ASP that our
urrent president is refusing to accept $2.600
rom Marc Bencckc on the grounds that Marc
hould pay us the SI 17 that he owes frornthc
pcnalty clause in the contract he signed.

Because I wrote the contract. and because I
m well aware of its strengths and weaknesses
in a court of law. lam in a good positionto see
what our class president is doing. (lary
Bennett seems to he doing more worrying
about headline-grabbing than about
replenishing our very low class funds. He is
not going to intimidate Marc into paying mun:
bccausc Murc has no legal obligation to pay
cvcn a dollar. Gary is only aggravating Marc
into making a decision that neither party
wants. another court battlc. this time on the
ollcctibilily of the note. And if (fury is so
worricd ovcr Sill. 1 wish that he would
explain why 520 was approprialcd from our
class funds to rcscrvc Dippikill lor th' use til
hc class council.

Now he will maintain that thc mono) is
going to bc rcplaccd. but so did Marc when he
allegedly look moncy from the class for
personal use. Gary rnighl also say that llrc
escrvaiion is for any interested class member.
but according to one class council tncmhcr. no
dvcriising. publicity. or mention was to he
made to us. the senior class.

When we as seniors wondcr what has
happened when we listcn to Silvcr ('hickcn in
he Colonial Quad U-1.oungc as our main
vcnt for senior wcck. at least now We will
know why — Gary Bennctt has upheld a
prinicjplc and not taken $2.600 because he
thinks that collecting $117 from Marc as a
penalty is more important.

The Plastic) Ammj , ~

As each semester nears an end, the library‘is" flooded with g  

 

finishing research papers and studyingTo'r linoleum.  .

semester, scores of students take advantage of extended library hours to

perform these tasks. r _

However, because of a serious distortion of priorities. this may well be
the last ﬁnals week the library will keep its doors open late for students.

During this ﬁnals week, there will be an active monitoring of the use of

the library. The monitoring will not cover the amount of students
present in the library studying; it will focus on how many facilities are
being used.
The intent of this monitoring, according to Library Director C. James
Schmidt is to determine whether the library is being used as a “library”
or “ merely a study hall”. Schmidt has stated that if the library is being
used during ﬁnals weeks for primarily studying, it is an “injustice” to the
facility.

Schmidt has demonstrated a unique idea: the library is not supposed
to be a place where students can study.

It doesn’t take much intelligence to realize that one of the best places
to study for ﬁnals is the library. it doesn’t take much intelligence to
realize that many students beneﬁt from the resourccs the library offers in
addition to being an ideal studying environment.

While at the same time he supports cutting of extended hours during
finals week, Schmidt is catering to the faculty by having students deliver
books to faculty members with ofﬁces on the academic podium.

Schmidt‘s distortion in priorities can perhaps be explained by the fact
that his performance as Director is undergoing an evaluation by a
committee.

The "Committee to Evaluate the Director“ has nine members —~ none
of which are students.

Something can be done.

If enough students take a few minutes to go out of their way to use
some of the library‘s facilities and ask for assistance from attendants,
thch will be no way those monitoring the library can deny that it is being
used to its fullest. X

So when you're in the library during ﬁnals week, take some time out to
use the periodical and reserve room. Check out an old New York Times
in the micro film area during a study break. Ask an attendant where you
can find volumes on Satrc even though you‘re studying for a Bio final.
'l'his, coupled with those who will be using the facilities anyway, should
help save the extended hours.

l'hcsc suggestions might distort the ﬁndings ofthosc monitoring the
library facilities, but the fact is that the facilities shouldn't be monitored
in the first place.

Perhaps it will help reaffirm the concept that the library is for the
students and for studying.
