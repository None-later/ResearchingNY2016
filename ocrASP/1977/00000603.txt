his transition. “I really like playing
forward. It lets me move more and I
like to move," the forward sitid.

Keane also had an all-around
good game. He ﬁnished with to

Keane is concerned with the play of

over Cortland and Binghamton.
“We keep making mistakes." said the
Dane captain. “Tonight we weren't
concentrating on breaking their

The I977 Albany State women's
gymnastics team has the potential to
be a strong contender in this season's
competitions, so afﬁrms gymnastic
coach. Edie Cobane. “We‘re looking
good in practice. but we‘re not deep,
yet." said Cobane. The team shouldl
gain the necessary depth as the
season wears on.

The gymnasts finished last season
sporting a record of eight wins and
seven losses. The team performed
consistently Well and was rewarded
for its effort by an invitation to the
state ﬁnals where they placed
seventh.

This year Albany State will be the
host school for the NYSAIAW
ﬁnals.

Cobane comments that the girls
have a long, tough season ahead of
them before the state ﬁnals roll
around in March. They have a
grueling schedule with meets in
Cortland. Ithaca and the University
of Vermont. teams Cobane

Cobane has high hopes for
returning junior, Carla Landsmen.
who performs beautifully in all
events.

Sophomore Corinne Palma is also
highly regarded as a potential ﬁrst—
place ﬁnisher. The balance beam and
ﬂoor exercises are Palma's strong
events and she is expected to do very
well in both.

Two other sophomores that
Cobane hopes will perform well this
season are Cindy Cobane and Mary
Ann Caperna.

Joining the team this year are two
freshmen. Kathy Schumalti and Sue
Cooper. Schumatti has a lot of
potential and she should be able to
score very well all around.

The teams ﬁrst meet is tomorrow.
when the gymnasts travel in
Cortland. The meet on Dec. 6 was
cancelled due to scheduling
problems. Last year Cortland

come back to tie the score at 35.
Again Mclver was the big gun
having l4 of Binghamton‘s 35
points.

But that was all the Colonials
would get the remainder of the half.
Reserve forward Drive Landry hit a
long jump shot that gave Albany a
two-point lead. 37-35. and Albany
was never headed.Keane closed out
the ﬁrst half with four more points as
the Danes went into the locker room
leading by six, 4l-39.

Binghamton out_ rebounded and
outshot the Danes in the half, but
trailed in the important half. but
trriiled in the important category-
points.

Albany coach "Doc" Saucrs
started four of his original starters in'
the second half along with Buddy
Wleklinski for Bob Clune.And that
proved to be the magic combination.
Using a fast-break aird sweepingjust
about everything off the boards. the
Danes reeled off 20 of the ﬁrst 24
points to break the game open.

Verdejo. who finished with a game
high 20 points on ten of It: from the
ﬂoor. started the spurt with a tap-in
off a missed shot. Cavanaugh did the
same. A layup by Wleklinski and
two jump shots by Keane rind the
Danes were ont be way.

Leading til-39 coach Suuers put in
some of his substitutes as did
Hinghamton‘s John Aflleck. The
moves almost proved fatal for the
Danes.

Albany suddenly went cold while
Binghamton couldn‘t miss. And
mostly it was Alton Anderson.

“I told my playersto watch out for
him (Anderson). that the kid can
play.“ said coach Saners. And play
he did. Anderson scored eight of his

second half points in a two nrinute
stretch to cut Albany's lead to (ii-5|
with H minutes left to play.

Sauers quickly went back to his
starters who bailed the Danes out.

Willi cigltl minutes left to play.
