.Lissner Threatens Libel Suit .

by Aron Smith

Ccntriii Council Chairperson
Mike Lissncr has threiitcncd to sue
the stitffof Colonial Quad‘s biweekly
newsletter. Common Sense. for libel.
according to former Council
member Bruce l’laxcn.

The charges stem from an
editorial written by l’liixcn rind other
members of the striff. printed in the
December ii issue. The editorial
claims that Lissner bus “alienated
people by his capricious tlllti
iirbitriiry inisiises ofpnwcr“iind risks
Coloniiil Quud residents to sign it
petition to recall him.

According to l'ltixcn. Lissncr‘s
fiithcr. itl1 attorney. corittictcd
Rcsidcnt Director intern Mtiurcen
i’i'oHisl. tithisor to Common Sense.
tilltl demanded llltil it retraction of
thc cditoriiil‘s allegations be printed
in the newsletter.

According to l’ltixcn. Lissncr‘s
l'iitlicr insisted that the rctriiction be
worded its follows:

"We. the staff of Common Sense.
iipoiigizc for viciously and
vindictivciy. personally attacking
Mike Lissncr. and for not contacting
him before printing the editorial."

"it‘s our belief. as a newspaper.
that we don‘t have to contact a
person before we print an editorial.“
siiid l’laxcn.

Lissner's ftithcr told Provost that
he would “take the newspaper to
court collectively and that he would
trike every person to court
individually“ if the retraction was
not printed in one week. said l’liixcn.

Provost refused to comment first
night.

“'l his would mean lllill the people
who collated it. tlic people who
stapled it. tiic people who typed it.
would iilso be sued." said l’lttxcn.
“ l here would bi: thirteen individual
stilts."

“it hits never been my trim to start
lcgiil proceedings." said Lissncr iii it
statement issued yesterday. “My aim
has only been to obtttin an apology
and retraction.“ hi: stiid.

Lissncr was offered it full-page
rcbtitttii iii Common Sense. but he
ticvcr responded to the offer. sttid
l’liixcn. "Noni: of us have ever been
contacted by Mike or his farther.
We‘ve done all our talking through
Miiurccn [Provost].“ he said. “It was
retraction or nothing."

Although no retraction has yet
been printed. Lissncr said that the
stitff hrid apologized verbally. and
that he felt that it would continue to
tict in good faith by placing it in
writing. '

Early this morning. ii tentative
iigrccnicnt was reached between
l.issncr and the stuff of Common
Sense. pending signature by till
members. The agreement reiid its
follows:

“We. the stuff of Common Sense.
wish to extend to Mike Lissucr tlliLI
Colonial Qtiiid. an apology for our
shortcomings in dealing with
standard journalistic guidiincs. We
want to give Mike lliC chance to offer
ii rebiittiil rind in subsequent issues.
we will strive to achieve higher
standards."

“We‘re going to wait until we
know all tiic iegiil aspects of the
situation.“ said l’liixen. “Wc‘vc
gotten the advice of legal counsel;
we‘ve spoken to lawyers. both frorn
SA and from the outside. We're
trying to get a recommendation from
counsel on whether or not we have it
case. He‘s the one who‘s going to
court."

Council Chair Elections May Need

by Thomas Martello

Seven months after he raised his
arms in victory following his election
as Central Council Chairperson.

Michael Lissncr is

News struggling to retain

Analysis that position.

Lissncr's plight

illustrates that the time has come to

give serious consideration to

changing the process by which
Council elects its chairperson.

Eircli spring. the very first duty of
the newly elected Council is to
choose ii chairperson who will serve
for the following year. The person
chosen holds out: of the most
iinportitnt positions in SA. l'lic
cliiiirpcrson's power citn be trin-
tiimount to the president's; he can. if
respected. influence Council in many
major decisions. Since Council
controls the purse strings of tilt: $06

student trix. many projects and ideas
live and die by its decisions.

The chairperson gets quite ti purse
also; his stipend allotment of $500 a
year is surpassed only by the SA
president and vice president.

Unlike the presidential and vice
presidential candidates. who must
fitce several weeks of rigorous
campaigning and scrutiny from tiic
incitiii before elected. the candidate
for chairperson has only to convince
30 individuals in one night. And in
many critics. those individuals are
voting for people they know very
little about.

Liist spring. Lissncr delciitcd
Diane i’iclic and Bruce l’itixcn for
chairperson ttl'tcr 2| ballots were

During the evening. numerous
students talked about the strong
points of certain candidates rind why

According to Dean ot the School of Business William Holstein. many

Council should cicct them. These
students were not Central Council
members; they were often friends of
candidates imported to make it good
impression on the Council.

For a vast majority of Ccritriil
Council members. it was their ﬁrst
meeting. What polled yesterday.
they all expressed it dissatisfaction
with the way the chairperson was
elected.

The ability to look good to it snttill
body of people ill one evening that
is the attribute most Council
members itdmit makes the difference
in a person being elected.

“We voted on it personality." stiid
Central Council member Mtirk
Kirsch. "Mike liitldt: rin excellent

Central Council Chairman Mike Ltunar has threatened to Iuotho aloft
ot Colonial mind's newsletter on charges that he was tlbolod.

Pliixcn continued, “We really
don‘t wrint to go to courthc don‘t
have the money or the time. it‘s very
easy for him. his father's a lawyer. it
doesn't cost him anything."

As suggested in the editorial. a

John Sharkey. “We really shouldn't
pick it chairperson until after it few

“He made it grctit first

Drive Gross. “We never got the
chance to get to know the people. A
lot of us were impressed with him iii

wouldn't get elected now."

One suggestion that has been
iiiiidc is to elect the new chairperson
iiftcr the new Council hiis hitd two or
three meetings. During the interim.
the outgoing chairperson would

While this method might give the
Council members it little time to get
to know L'ticlt other. it really doesn‘t
solve the problem. During this time

petition to recall Mike Lissner as u
Colonial Quad representative is
being circulated on the quad. If
Lissncr is recalled as Colonial Quad
representative. he will have to give
up his position its chairperson. For
any action to be taken on the
petition. one-sixth of the quad‘s
population. about 200 students.
must sign it.

According to Central Council
representative Abbie Havkins. the
movement to recall Lissner was
initiated by Plaxcn and SUNYA
Cheerleader Phyllis Mazznreili.

Htivkins charged that Pluxcn
turned against Lissncr when he was
not appointed chairman of Central
Council‘s Financial Committee iis
promised. and Mazrnrelli was
disturbed when Lissner voted
ngriinst funds for the cheerleaders.

Htivkins said that Pliixen and
anztirciii have been using the quad
newsletter in a "personal. vindictive
manner.“ while they could “use their
energies towrird working for the
quad."

Now the future of Common Sense
may be in trouble. According to
Plaxcn. the staff may be denied
iicccss to Residence Office
equipment next semester. making
printing the newsletter verydifficult.
