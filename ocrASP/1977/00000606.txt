Council Chair Election Revamping

present system. They will have more
time to convince Council members
that they are the best choice for
chairperson, but it will not be ample
time for them to be seen in action.

Perhaps the best solution is to
schedule Central Council elections
about two months before the
chairperson is elected.

With the outgoing chairperson
continuing his post. the Council
members will be able to get a true
indication of what each member can
do after about eight meetings or so.

There is. of course. going to be
politicking for the position. but in
this case politicking would have to
go beyond words and into action.
With several members eyeing thetop
spot. this period may very well turn
out to be the most productive ofthe
Central Council year.

There are problems with this
suggestion also. Because it is policy
to have the old Council approve the
following year‘s budget. their
timetable. as well as the SA
President‘s. would have to he pushed
up two months. However. many
people have clammorcd for this
anyway. citing the perennial apathy

that engulfs Council each spring as
ﬁnals near and the group attempts to
crank out a last-minute budget.
Many people have recommended
that the SA presidential elections be
held two months earlier also.

Another problem that may arise is
that there will be a lame-duck
chairperson for eight meetings.
There is a possibility that this
individual might turn apathetic. but
perhaps this will be counter-acted by
the enthusiasm of prospective
chairperson candidates.

Every Central Council member
and SA ofﬁcal questioned yesterday.
was against the current method of
electing the chairperson.

The performance of Lissner this
semester may have had an inﬂuence
on this thinking. Of 23 Council
members polled yesterday. a slight
majority were not satisfied with the
job he has done.

H owcver. perhaps more
prominent in the minds of Council
members is the memory that when it
was put to them to select one of the
three candidates running for
chairperson last spring. they did so
largely out of ignorance.
