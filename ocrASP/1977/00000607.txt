“SPEED casts
This must  a" “speed trap" ﬁrst:
Police on the campus of Central

- Washington University say they will

start using a radar device in order to
ticket bicyclists on campus who are
exceeding the ﬁve-milc-per-hour

speed limit. »

Ofﬁcers on the 350-acre campus
explain that radar will‘be employed

against the two-wheelers because of
'a recent increase in bike accident and

near-misses.

Anyone clocked at peddling l0
miles an hour will be fined $30: each
extra mile per hour will cost another
$2 to $3.

What's more. the bike speeding
tickets will be included on the
pcddlcr‘s permanent driving record
because, according to police, a bicy-
cle is a "vehicle."

LOVE STORY

Writer and ‘cartoonist Jules

project will be based on the exploits
til the cartooit character Popeye.

l"cillcr says that thc ntovtc

‘ WOOD YOU?

Americans may soon be quafﬁng
down beer which has been aged. .
well, at" least for a little while, in
wooden cans. . .

A spokesperson for the Anheuser
Busch Company says Anheuser is
currently experimenting with cans
made from wood ratherthan metal.

The company says the experimen~
tal cans so far have been made with
pressed wood, which has been
coated with a transparent ﬁlm so it
resembles a metal container.

BIG MESSAGE

As if there weren‘t enough
commercials around these days, a
New York company has announced
plans to begin writing advertising
messages on clouds in the sky.
Iliat's right. on clouds.

A company called Laser Physics
claims it has pcrlcctcd a laser beam
lt‘L‘lllIltlllC that permits words and
t.‘\’cll complctc sentences to he

SEXIS'I' LAWS
An international male liberation
group called “Men‘s Equality NOW"

has petitioned the United Nations to '

investigate what it claims are sexist
divorce laws in the U .S. and Canada.

in a petition to theiUN Human
Rights Commission inqoencva, the
men‘s group charges-"ethat North
American divorce laws viciously
discriminate against males.

According to the petition, in its
words, “fathers are persecuted,
criminalized, jailed, disenfranchised
of the children. destroyed ﬁnancially
and emotionally enslaved." It claims
that a study of 40,000 divorces in
seven states showed “an obvious sex
bias in favor of the female party."
The UN commission accepted the
petition without comment.

BODY SIGNS

Another sign of the growing
equality among the sexes is the fact
that more and more women are
being tattooed these days.

area report that just a lew decades

customers in tattoo shops. Today,
however. at least one-fourth of the
customers are females, and the
proportion of women is increasing
yearly.

One artist. George “Doc” Webb.
states that his female clients in the
past were limited to what he calls a
few daring “society women." Today,
however. Webb says' he tattoos
stenographers, stewardessca. nurses
and other professional women.

Another San' Diego tattooist.
Joyce Nemeth. says that 80 per cent
of her customers are women.

OLD NEWS

It's shortage time again. and this
time it‘s not money. sugar, or even
fuel. It's old nchpapers.

The American Paper institute is
claiming that there is a critical
shortage of old newspapers, which
can be used for recycling purposes in
the United States.

The institute says that the
problem is itot really that there is a
shortage of old nchpapcrs, but that
only 25 per cent of the papers we
read are eventually recycled.

The Institute warns that utilua
more people begin recycling

newspapers, .many of the 1225

recycling mills in the country could
be forced to shut down before'the
end of the year. .

The institute has some good news
too. it says that many groups which
are currently recycling papers are
making as much as vSl00',000 a year
by collecting old newpspera. "

VACATION SPOT

For the ﬁrst time in [6 years.
regular charter ﬂights to Cuba may

initiate a regular Havana run on
December 20. with a weekly ﬂight
from Chicago via Detroit. Trans

\vcckly ﬂights from New York on
