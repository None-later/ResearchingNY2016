The decade of the fifties
landmarks the reflux of Roosevelts‘
“New Deal“ politics in the United
States and the implementation of
“Operation Bootstrap“ in Puerto
Rico. For all purposes. this was a
period of change.

Nonh American society was
experiencing an economic develop-
ment that will have its social
expression in the growth of the so-
called middle class. In the same way.
that the beauracratic machine
augments there is going to be an
increment in the “white collar"
workers. Such. the white
populations from the urban sites
move to the suburbs.

As a consequence of this process.
new needs had to be created in the
United States. The lowest
employments on the social ladder
had to be occupied. It is for this
reason that Black Americans will
migrate from the South to the North
and thc West of the country
temmigration that was not
accidental). the Chicanos in the
Southeast and the Puerto Ricans
principally in New York. New
Jersey. Chicago and Conneticut.

In Puerto Rico. the society is
suffering a transformation that has
been called the Democratic
Bourgeois Revolution. Such
transformation has its economic
expression in “Operation Boostrap.“
I his political economy sets the basis
oi change in the Puerto Rican
Society by way of the
industrialiwtion process. Such a
process is well commanded by the
North American bourgeois wtth the
Puerto {ican bourgeots in the
capactty of mediator. In other
words. “Operation Bootstrap" was
an opportunistic measure by the
Popular Democratic l’artytPPD) to
consolidate its position in the
country by responding to the
interests of the North American
ruling class.

  
  

In fact. the migration of Puerto
Ricans to the United States is a
"necessary" measure to bear
“Operation Bootstrap“ and on the
other hand to supply part of the
manpower that the Nonh American
vstem need to occupy the country‘s
worst jobs. However. they had tried
to make us believe that Puerto Rican
migration to the U.S.A. is a regular
phenomenon ofpopulation mobility
which happened without any inter-
vention of the Puerto Rican and
U.S.A. establishment. But. “it is not
the same to call the devil. than to see
him come" ("del dicho al hccho hay
un gran trecho".l The truth is that
the Popular Democratic Party
(PPI)) needed to ha\e out of the
scene the unemployment problem to
maintain the relative political
stability that ruled the country.
rooting in this way. its political
power. In its counterpart. the United
States needed cheaper labor to
occupy thcjobs that nobody wanted
in the country. l kt‘ for example: the
so-called “ti :nateros" (tomato
pickers). drshs'ashers and factory
work for criirskilled workers. At the
same time. by the process of
industrialization tn Puerto Rico.
American capitalism was
establishing the myth of “Puerto
Rican democracy" as a model for
Latin America.

It is in this way that during the
fifties. around 600.000 Puerto
Ricans emmigrated to the United
States constituting one of the main
examples of massive migration in
contemporary history and at the
same time ofimperialisttcaggression
to the unity and even more so. to the
extstcnce of a nation.

’I he Black Americans and Puerto
Ricans are going to live in the worst
neighborhoods of the urban centers

Bakke Decision —
Attacks Affirmative Action

In October of this year the United
States Supreme Court is scheduled
to hear a case that will determine the
constitutionality of the special
admissions program at Davis
Medical School of the Universny oi
(.‘rilriornia (UC). ’Ihe specral
admissions program at Davis
Medical School was created in order
to rcmcmdy the injustices committed
against minorities due to ractal
discrimination. It allocates I6 slots
out of mo each year for minority
students. This program came under
attack a few years ago when Allan
Baltic. a white man who had been
denied admission to Davis. filed a
law suit against the school. charging
it With reverse racialdiacrimination.
If the US Supreme Court upholds
the decision of the lower courts. it
will serve as the basis for the
elimination of special admissions
programs throughout the country. It
will mean the possible elimination of
affirmative action programs in the
areas besides education. such as
employment. training and
promotion of minorities. both in the
private and public sectors.

of the University of California

would [irttntiri‘tics since it will mean
the eliminatloii olthc smalladvances

made in the past decade in the
struggle for racral equality. In
addition. it represents an attack on
the entire working class because it
will intensify class dl\ man by setting
whites against non-whrtes and vice
versa. lighting one another for

In I973. Bakkc. a J4 year-old
aerospace engineer. applied for
admission to Davis Medical School.
He was denied admission to U.C.. as
well as to several other medical
schools. A year later he was rejected
at Davis again. At that point. he filed
a law suit against the University.
Peter Storandt. it do Davrs
Medical School Asststant to the
Dean for Student Affirm and
Admissrons. was instrumental in
pushing Bakke to file the suit. He
convinced Bakke that the reason he
was rejected was because of the slots
set aside for minority students. In the
suit. Bakkc argued that he was
qualified to enter the Medical
School but wait nor accepted because
he was white. According to Bakke
this was in violation of the 14th
amendment of the Constitution of
the United States which protects
citizens from racial discrimiiiatioru:

is foreign and where one is seen as it
foreigner. Furthermore. a foreigner
of inferiorquality. One isconfronted
with several barriers: the language.
values. economic conditions as well
as racial relationships. A large part
of this generation does not detach
themselves from the dream of one
day returning to the Island. this
makes them maintain the culture
superficially. Examples of this
would he: las bodegas (grocery
stores). la marqueta (market place).
el cine hispano (Spanish theater). la
Iglesia Hispana (Spanish churehl.
the radio stations and television
channels rn Spanish.

Later. the second generation
comes forth. A large amount of its
components are born and grow up in
American soctety. lhcse children
directly experience their childhood

clearly shown in the economic
injustice. racral prejudice. the
cultural aggression as exempliﬁed in
the theory of the "Melting Pot"
which states that all ethnic groups iri

a counter suit demanding that the

not whether or not Bakke should be

Without evcr holding a trial. the
Yolo County Superior Court
deeided the case on the basis of
written evidence. The court ruled
that the program did indeed
discriminate against Bakke because
of his color; therefore. it was
unconstitutional. However. the
court also chIdcd that Bakke was
not entitled to an order of admit.
lance to Davii Medical School.
Baltkc. as well as the U.L‘.. appealed

The case was then transferred to
the State Supreme Court of
California. try-passing the Court of
Appeals because of the "importance
of the issuer involved." It seemed
that the U.C‘. was interested in a
quick settlement of the ctiiic. In

Racial prejudice is an idelogicalv

component immersed in ‘the
lmperialistic vision of the Anglos
which participates in the model—
Society vs. Barbarians, in which.
naturally. the Puerto Ricans are seen
as Barbarians. A clear example of
this can be seen throughout the
history of the United States and
Puerto Rico‘s relations that have
come about as a consequence of the
Hispanic American War in l898
where Puerto Rico is given to the
United States as “booty of War."
The attempts to americanirc the
Puerto Ricans in order to "civilire"
them have been numerous. Another
clear example of this was the
obligation fo classes to be taught in
English from 1900 until I948 in the
Public Instruction System in Puerto
Rico in all levels.

This process ol consctousncss of
their oppressed condition along with
the general questioning ol American

The Jerry Garcia concert started 45
minutes late, but most of the Palace
' audience felt that it would be worth the
wait to see the well respected leader of the
Grateful Dead. It is well known that most
Garcia concerts are a tour de force in
musical delight. Deadhead or not!

Yet UCB‘s last concert of the season
was disappointing. Garcia and his band
started out with a liiid back “almost”
cooking version of the Mirttclc‘s classic.
“I Second That Emotion.“ Halfway
through the song sound problems
occurred. but they were corrected ten
inirtutcs later.

(iiircin is known for his Iongjirms and
this night was not an eXception. Garcia
never introduced the band so it will
suffice to say that the keyboard work
during the lcngthyjam “They Love Iiach
()thcr“ was excellent.

Garcia‘s guitar work was exemplary on
the C&W oldie “A Simple Twist of little“
The song featured a lionky tonk style on
electric piano and a longjam once again.

By the time they did the 'l‘crnptation‘s
"The Way You Do the Things You Do"

adding a clever twist by casting a black
