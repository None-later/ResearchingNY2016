' Ho‘opsters' Suffer 71-70 Setback to

 

Drop First Contest In SUN YAC Play;
Oppose Hartwiok Tomorrow Night

by Eddie Emermen

The Albany State basketball team
suffered its first defeat of the season
Saturday night the hard way—a 71-
70 loss to Geneseo State.

Albany had three opportunities to
win or at least tie the game in the last
l3 seconds. but each time came up
just short. With the Danes trailing
7l-69. Albany's center Barry.
Cavanaugh went to the foul line in a
one-and-one situation. Cavanaugh
brought the Danes to within one
point by hitting the first attempt but
couldn‘t tie it, leaving the Danes
trailing by one with l3 sceondsto go.

Second Chance

With Geneseo in control. all they
had to do was run out the clock but
Albany saw things differently
electing to foul Kevin Westfall.
Westfall gave Albany a second
chance at a win by missing both
shots. .

Instead of calling time-out. the
Danes elected to hurry the ball
upcourt. With three seconds left.
reserve guard Bill Bellamy got offa
shot which bounded offthe rim. Still
the Danes weren't dead. Carmelo
Verdejo got the ball in the cornerand
threw up it last-second attempt. but
that hit the rim and fell off as the
final buzzer sounded.

Geneseo practically threwthc game
into Albany hands in the final two
minutes of play. Leading 7l-65.
Geneseo failed to convert any shots
and watched the Danes close the
gap. mostly due to Cavanaugh.
Cavanaugh. who led both teams iii
scoring with 2i points. scored the
last six points to bring the Danes
within striking distance. it wasn‘t
enough.

“Looking back at the game. l wish
I ltad called time-out when we got
the rebound off those two missed
free throws.“ said Albany‘s coach
“Doc” Sauers. “We set up the play
offthe foul shot and Bellamy moved
it upcourt well but just didn't get off
a good shot. And then Vcrdejo had a
chance also but he had a very
difficult shot with people on him.“

Albany had taken a 37-29 lead
into the second half. Throughout
most of the first half. Albany found
themselves leading the Blue Knights
by margins of eight to l2 points.
Good shotting (I? for 35 from the
floor) and good rebounding
accounted for the leads in the first
half.

The second half was a different
story. Geneseo. whose offense
couldn't get started in the ﬁrst half.
switched to a double-post offense.

Suddenly. Albany saw their lead
slipping away as their defense was
unable to adjust to Geneseo‘s switch.
At the otlter end ofthe court. Albany
went cold and stayed cold the rest of
the game shooting only 28 percent
from the field (IO-37).

With 8:40 to plrry. Geneseo no
longer had to pltiy catclrup as they
took the lead 55-54 on ttvo free
throws by Lorcnro Sutton. Albtttty
tied the game twice after that at 57—
57 and 59-59 biit Geneseo took lltc
lead for good at 6l-59.

What lturt even more was the Blue
Knights‘ big center. six-foot seven
Pat Moriarty played the last eight
minutes with four fours. Coach
Saucrs indicated they tried to get
him to committ his Fifth foul but like
everything else, they couldn‘t.

Albany‘s loss was the first in
SUNYAC play against two wins
while Geneseo improved their
SUNYAC record to 2-0. Overall the
Blue Knights are 4-3. The winner in
lthe SUNYAC at the end of the
‘season gets an automatic bid in the
NCAA tournament. But coach
Sauers isn‘t overly worried about the
loss. “The loss did hurt us in the
conference. but nobody goes
undefeated in the conference." said
Sauers. “We just have to wait for

Referee Plays Part In JV Cagers’ Defeat

by Paul Schwartz

Albany State‘s junior varsity
basketball coach Bob Lewis
described the ending of last
Saturday‘s game as “bizarre and
unfortunate." Whatever description
used. it still comes out as a loss.

The Albany State junior varsity
basketball team went down to its
first defeat of the season with a 73-7]
overtime loss to West Point.

The first half was a close. seesaw
battle. and neither team was able to
establish a large lead. The West
Point team played a physical
ballgame. and their strength advan-
tagc gave Albany problems.

eventually fouled out in the second
half. and his replacement. reserve
center Stcve Low scored l2 points in
a credible back-up role.

At the half Army led by one. and
the close play continued on into the
second half. The fine play of Ray
Cesare and Dan Casey helped keep
the Danes close. Cesare. a 6-3
swingman. led the Danes with to
points to match his season high.
while Casey chipped in with l2
points.

As the game wore on. the rough
play began to take its toll on the
Danes. Albany was forced to
commit numerous fouls. and Army
was hitting a good percentage of
their foul shots. “We really didn't

adjust to their physical type of play.“
commented coach Lewis. “it seemed
that we had the fouls called on us.
Their physical play bothered us."

A revealing statistic shows that
Albany scored seven more field goals
than Army did. but Army hit 25 out
of 35 foul shots compared to the
Danes nine out of IX. Albany was
called for almost 30 fouls in the
game.

The two teams played so evenly
that thelirst 39 minutesdid not settle
a thing. The margin was exactly the
same as when they had started. a tie
score. With 20 seconds remaining in
the game. Albany had possession of
the ball. What follows is truly a
"bi/arre coding."

The Danes immediately scored
from the inbounds play on it basket

by Don Juron. The basket gave
Albany a two-point lead. and Juron
was fouled on the play as well. The
clock read l4 seconds left.

On the play there was also a
technical foul called on Army. Juron
stepped to the line and missed the
free throw. Coach Lewis then chose
Marty McGraw to shoot the
technical foul shot. McGraw stepped
to the line. and lie also missed the
free throw.

Leading by two points. Albany
was awarded the ball at mideourt as
a result ofthctechnical foul. The ball
was inbounded to Low in the

the clear. and passed the ball to him.

“We're talking about roughly

“It isn't a very strenuous process

Paul Page. “The bold process

“According to Ward. SASU is

tultt Leibowitz did not file for her

Peabody feels that S‘Ioverlfy was
