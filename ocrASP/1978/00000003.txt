' "To SUNYA Community.

‘ by Mitch Dneh

The Page Hall gym on the Draper
Campus is now open for the SU NYA
community. although the university
has not provided funds for super-
visory personnel. according to Ad-
ministrative Assistant Bob Lew.

ﬂ. 'l'he.gym is being run by voluntary
supervisors and the success of the
program depends upon the number
of students volunteering, according
to Lew.

SUNYA has provided the gym
with equipment. a telephone. and
has agreed to pay electricity ex-
penses.

A proposal for a downtown un-
ivcrsity gym was presented last
February by Lcw and several others
to a special administrutivc com-
mittec resulting in an experimental
program last spring. Then the pro-
ject was presented once again to the
committee and administrators. A
new extended program was ap-
proved and has begun this week.

The gym had originally been used
by SUNYA until the uptown campus
was constructed. according to Lew.
Then the gym was used by a high
school affiliated with the university.

Last year the high school program
was phased out and the gym became.
empty.

"The gym provides offjcampus ‘
and downtown students with a mu_ch ' A

needed, recreational facility.
However the gym is smair'and we
cannot accomodate a large number
of people." said Lew.

The facility is made up of one
basketball court and will be used for
full court league games. quarter
court pick-up games. and volleyball
matches.

The facility is currently open from
4:00 p.m. to [0:30 p.m. Monday
through Thursday and from 12:30
p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Sundays. The
hours may ﬂuctuate. depending on
the availability of volunteer super~
visors. SUNYA iD cards must be
presented for admission.

There are two men‘s basketball
leagues and one women‘s league
presently using the court. The
women‘s teams are equipped with
such names as “The Hookers." “The
Heads." and “The Fire Hazard.“ The
male counterparts have supplied
names like “The Corn Becl‘ers." " l‘hc
Milky Puppets." and The
Bartender‘s l’ride.“

N o More Housing at Country Squire

by B. W. Fox

SUNYA students are no longer
being housed at the Country Squire
Motel in Guilderland. according to
motel owner Douglas Monstrom.

None of the 68 students who
began the school year at the motel
have returned this semester.
Monstrom said.

An Off Campus Housing Ofﬁce
spokesperson said SUNYA didn‘t
refer any students to the Country
Squire for housing this Spring as a
result of problems experienced by
students last semester.

Complaints from students about
transportation to campus and hous-
ing conditions at the motel led the
