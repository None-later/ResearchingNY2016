How many strong nten. physically
strong men. not tyrants. of antiquity can
you name? That's right. There is Samson
in Biblical history. Atlas and Herakles are
in Greek mythology. Atlas. later
identified with the Atlas mountain range
in North Africa. was said to support the
heavens on his head and hands. And
Herakles. Well. he is the subject ofthis
Classical Forum. But did you know that
Atlas arid I'leraklcs once met? In
performing one of his labors. bringingto
Iiurysthctis the golden apples from the
garden of the Ilcspcridcs. Heracles had to
ask directions ol Atlas. Atlas promptly
volunteered to get the apples for him and
departed. leaving llcraklcs ltoldiitgttp the
heavens. Atlas returned with the apples.
bttt had no intention ol resuming his task
of supporting the sky. lhrotigh a trick.
probany suggested by Athena. Heraklcs
managed to gain possession ofthc apples
and leatc Atlas with the heavens once
again resting upon his head and hands.
Our illustration shows one of the mctopcs
from the temple ol Zeus at OI) mpia. On it
we see depicted Herakles. Atlas. and the
protective prcscnce of Athena.
Herakles. Roman Ilercules. is
probably the best known of all the Greek
heroes or detnigods. llis natnc. meaning
“glory ol Hera." indicates that he was
ortcc II mortal man. who through the
pcrlorntattcc ol many noble and
courageous deeds. bcitcltcial to mankind.
was clctatcd to the status ol (.ll\illt.‘. or
semi—divine. being arid gained a place

tltcjealotis wile ol /_ctIs. has become his
implacable enemy. It is through her
machinations that he comes into the

So far Ilcraklcs appears \er) strong.

as a fugurejoffun. strong. usually valiant.
basically good-natured and kindly. but
none too bright. and inclined to
ovcrindulgcncc in food and drink. In the
Alkesiis if Euripides he is shown as a
boorish guest in the home of Admctus.
whose wife. Alkestis. is upon the point of
death. Admetus. however. as a good host.
ltas concealed his wife‘s condition from
his guest. When Heraklcs discovers the
true state of affairs. he makes amends for
his former conduct by wrestling with
Death and saving the life of Alkcstis. In
the Frogs of Aritstopltancs I’lerakles
probably reaches his lowest point as a
comic character. In this play Dionysus.
patron deity ofthe theater. in the disguise
of Herakles. descends ittto the realm of
the dead in search of Euripides. the
favorite tragedian of the Athenians.
Dionysus cltooscs this disguise because
Herakles as one of his labors. had stolen
Cerberus. the wtacltdog of the realm of
Hades. and broght him upintothe land of
the living. Dionysus presents us with a
figure of Heraklcs who is not only a comic
buffoon. but a cowardly one as well.
Though in the Frogs Itot Heraklcs
himself. bttt a parody of Herakles.
appears. the hero scents to be mocked
along with the god Dionysus.
Aritsiophancs could hardly have taken
such liberties with the character of the
ltcro. if his audience had not already been
prepared for such a prescittatiort.

For the Stoic philosophers llcrakles
was a symbol ol lortttudc attd moral
principle. In tltcir ethical teachings tltcy
employed It parable. attributed to
I’I‘odietts ol (cos. a fifth century sopltist.
In this parable Herakles. at the poittt of
entering upon manhood. is presented
with a choice between It life of pleasure
and \ice and one ot toil and \irtttc. As we
should suspect by this titttc. Heraklcs
chose the latter. In the version given by
Xenophon in tire .llc/Horuhi/iu the two
ways are represented by two beautiful
women. When you are making your own
choices at the beginning of a new
semester. which will you choosc‘.’
