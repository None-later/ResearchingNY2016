By MIKE PEARLMAN
“Honk! Honk! Hey. what the hell is
wrong with you? If you wanna ride a
bike, go to the goddammed parkl
“You fuckin‘ idiot. . . You coulda
killed yourself!"

“Jesus Christ. you can‘t even walk on
the streets anymore!"

“You stupid son-of—a-bitch. I‘m busy
makin' money drivin' a cab and you‘re
going joy riding. I have a good mind to
run you over!"

These are just a few ofthe remarks one
hears from people that don't know or
don‘t understand what it is to be an
“Artful Dodger.“ I‘m not speaking about
the perspicacious young street urchin
who appears in ()lfl't’l‘ 'l‘ii'is/ as a petty
thief and con-man wandering the streets
of nineteenth century London. I‘m
speaking about the bicycle messenger of
the I970‘s who hustlcs his way across
Manhattan to earn his daily living.

There are three main ingredients
necessary in being an “Artful Dodger.“
One must have strong legs and bein good
physical shape. quick. sharp reﬂexes and
good eyesight. and most of all. a lot of
guts (or insanity, whichever you prefer).
Incidentally. a bicycle is also helpful.

I first learned of the unusual vocation
when my father mentioned something at
the supper table about “kids riding
bicycles around the city with bags on their
backs delivering packages.“ l was just
about to shove a juicy piece of steak into
my mouth when I heard him say. “How
would you like to do that over the
vacation?" I was sure he was kidding and
told him he tiiust bcjokiiig. Me. a college
student. riding my bicycle around the eity'i
Ridiculous.

“No. I‘m not joking.“ he said. “You‘ve
been complaining about how
monotonous your \acation has been and
you haven‘t found a job yet. have you?"
He was right on that score. I hadn‘t found
a job and l was beginning to get crabby
and depressed from just staying at home
all the time. I thought fora few minutes
while the rest of the family continued
eating.

"All right.“ i said. “What do 1 have to
do?“ He then began to explain to me that
lica had spoken with a young woman that
day that had just finished her winter
recess and was going back to college.
During her vacation she had been a
messenger. riding her bicycle all around
the city and earning some pretty good
money from what she had told hirii. She
said that she enjoyed riding llL'f brcyclc
and found the job easy and lucratiyc. She
told him she had earned between fills
and S|75 a heck ffi\c days \\til'l\'). \\'i:ll.l
heard that and I began to scctltilltll signs
in Hunt of my eyes.

“Yeah. btit she ll\l.‘\ in the city and I'd
hate to coniriiiitc."

ll) miles north of New \oik).

"Well." tiiy lather 'itlltl. "l coniniiiic
cicry day and don‘t mind Il .iiid llll\ ]tll)
would only be for a month i could take
you in in the min mugs and you could take
the bus home." I didn‘t say anything btit
only thought for a while. “Well. you do
what you want." he added. I became
restless and stpiirmcd in my scat. l liml
been crabby these past few days and lt/fr/
need the money for school.

i said. " llcsidt's.

 

"Okay." I said. “I‘ll do it.“ it would at
[east be good exercise and I‘d get to know

my way around the city. I reasoned.

The next day my father contacted the
“ Mobile Messenger Service" and they told
him to have me come in for an interview.
The following day I drove into New York
with my father for the interview. I was a
little nervous as I entered the small office
on the corner of Madison Avenue and
54th Street. On my way in I saw a lot of
other young men and Women coming in
and out the door with large red canvas
bags strung across their shoulders. 'l‘wo
boys were repairing a bicycle with a flat
tire outside the office. I was sentto a small
inner office where a young fellow looking
to be in his twenties interviewed me. The
whole thing only took about ten minutes.
After i finished reading the terms and
conditions of the job. he told me to report
back in the morning at 8:30 run. with my
bicycle ready to start working.

As I waited downstairs in the lobby of
the building for my father to come pick
me up and take me to the Port Authority
bus terminal. l was still quite uneasy
about not knowingthe city very well and
worried about the dangerous aspects of
thejob. My friends told me I was crazy. I
couldn‘t help but wonder if they were
right. “What the hell.“ I thought. “I need
the cash."

My first day out was very cold but I was
dressed warmly for the occasion. l'oo
warmly as a matter of fact. I wound up
shedding tyvo of the four layers of
clothing l had on. As the day progressch
found I had less trouble than i had
previously thought I would have finding
my way around Manhattan. My
confidence increased and I found the
advice of the dispatchers very helpful. By
the end of the day l was whippingai'ound
the traffic as if I had done it all my life.

It oiin took me a few hoursto get a fch
for judging the distances between cars
and I figured out quickly that traffic flows
cast on the even numbered streets and
West on the odd iittmbercd streets. llicrc
arc of course a few exceptions which I
found out about later. I made many
mistakes and I knew I would keep making
them until i got to know the city better.
They were small mistakes,though. and i
only lost a minimal amount ol'time. l was
actually beginning to enjoy being an
“Artful Dodger.“ being outside most of
the time. and seeing all the people. llic

varicd architecture of New York
intrigued tire and i took every chance I
could get to record dilfcrctit landmarks
into my memory lor' future iclcrcricc.

i also learned to avoid certain areas
which it c re always crowded wrth
pedestrians or unusually lic;i\_\ tiallic.

llicrc are many disadnintrigcs to being
it bicycle iiicsscngcr. One has In biatc thc
cold weather. worry about neat and tciii
on his or her bicycle. piit up with the tiring
physical nature of tlic \ioik rityohed. and
especially. consider the possibility of
suffering injuries from .iccitlcnrs with
cars. pedestrians. lt|.\ls. httscs‘. ti ticks. and
even other cyclists. Yet there is one major
reason why most pt-oplc doit. lhcnioncy
is excellent. Hittinganawragccighthoiii
day. a messenger can earn between iii if)
and $5.00 pci hour. llicrc is also the
added benefit oI not having to pay
withholding takes or social security taxes
because you are considered your own

boss. the only tax takcii otrl is a one per

cent work man's compensation tax which

amounts to between one and two dollars a

week. Many mcsscngcrs also like the fact

that you work otit_of doors. your hours
are very llcxiblc. and you come in contact

\\rth many different people during a day‘s

work.

Although the labor force is a very
lr'unsicnt one and many of the messengers
only work between semesters at college or
dtiririg vacations if they are in high
school. a surprising number that I've
spoken with work ftill time or moonlight
dtiririg the day and hold rcgularjobs at
night Many of the regulars arc hiin
school gradtiatcs that are not ready to
attend college yet or don't plan to attend
college at all. Ihcy arc in ing life on a day
by driv basis and until they decide what
they want for their future. they are
content hciiig nicsscngcrs and earning
more money than may college graduates
that 1 know earn.

I spoke with a fc\\ regulars after work
one day and asked t|icm.“Why doyoti do
it?” Here are some of the ariswcrc l
rccciycd:

“I couldn‘t liiid anothcrjob and thrsjob
pays good money.“

"It‘s an easy way to niaki- ifiying. liust
ride my bicycle around the city everyday
and when tlic \icathci‘s bad. I \yalk,“

"It's interesting seeing .iII lllt' people on
the streets and I'm not cooped up in an
office like l has before "

"l‘iii i’l musician. and tit‘lll_L' this lJHt's
inc thc lit-t-tforn I need to play and do
gins,"

\Itliough thcsc |L‘\ptill\t\ \.l|\ .ihiiost
.ill the rcgtiluts .igiccd on one factor that
made the job worthwhile: it pays well.

Ihc nicsscngci business is a iclatrycly
new field and liris orin begun to flourish
iiithin thc past lL'\\ ycriis. \et. more and
iiioic cyclists criiiy'iiig different colored
bags. the
iiicsst-ngci sciyicc firms. can be seen in
\cii \oik ('ity these days. l'irins dciiling
Ill some way \\llll carrrcrsand mcsscngcrs
.uc cropping upall ti\t,'l the country. i his
would scent to indicate that there is an
available and steady supply of labor
interested in this type of ctiiploynicnt. and
that thc prolitability of establishing. such
.i service is as measurable as the
Iticriitiu-ricss of working for one.

So. the nest time you‘re in New York
('ity. oi any large center of commerce lot
that .rititter. .iiid you see maybe one.
possibly two or c\cn three. but probably
more. persons riding bicycles \\lllt large
sot-ks on their bricks filled with nituiilla

you'll know that lie. or she. is an artful
