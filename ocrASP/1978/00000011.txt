Quark. Strangeness and Charm
Hawkwtnd

 

By ALAN Al.l’F.R

the album Quark .S'Iruitgertt‘sxr and
(harm by l-lawkwind is an interesting
attempt by the group to produce a spacey.
progressive Ll'. Unfortunately, their
effort is plagued by the most typical
problem rock music encounters it
becomes monotonous.

The group consists ol l)a\'c Brock on
guitar and synthesi/cr; Robert Calbv'rt.
lyricist and lead vocals; Simon llottsc on
keyboards and violin; Adrian Shaw on
bass; and Simon King on percussion The
group‘s musicianship is adequate
considering that their music is rooted iii
basic hard rock.

Although their music can he simply
categorized as rock. Hawkwind attempts
to ornament their sotirid with a barrage of
synthesizers and pre-recordcd sound

: effects. This aids in giving the grotip it full

sound. btit not one that can be called
innovative or progressive. In fact. they
tend to be played-out! Because of their
extensive rise of synthesi/ers. the ertd
result ol this album is art I.I’ laced with
spacey sounds which cover up the typical
rock chord progressions.

'l he tnost interesting aspect ol this
alhuin is that the lyrics attempt to lorccast
man‘s plight in the luture. Cabcrt directs
his biting lyrics at our technologically
laden society. lamenting about otii"'l'iiiled
society." stating that we are heading lor
"damnation alley." where the final result
will he nuclear holocaust. Although the
albtttri can be delincd asa concept album.
its message is extrertiely eon\olttted and
at times lca\es the listener conlttscd.

()ii the whole this album is mediocre.

the musical themes are redundant and
indistinguishable hour each other.
Because ol the heaiy rise oi synthesi/crs
arid sound cttccts this album appears to
he innoiatric. yet II is only dressed in the
guise ol progressnc music. Quark.
i/rt/Iigt'umi tlIlt/ (‘ltarnt is all it is.

 

The Arranger
Gerry Mulligan

 

By JON IIRliSSNI‘LR
When the name (ierry Mulligan is
mentioned it is usually associated with It
saxo honist. This album tries to bring

   
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
   
  

out other aspects of Mulligan’s
musicianship. Mulligan has been
arranging tunes for well-known big hands
since the late 40‘s. when he was 20 years
old. This album is a compilation of some of
his earlier works as an arranger tor Gene
Krupa and Elliot Lawrence. plus a side of
previously unreleased Gerry Mulligan
and orchestra recordings arranged by you
know who.

It says on the album cover that “big
hands are scarce nowadays . . . ‘ If the
laws of supply and deitiand apply here it
seems that the dcnrand for big band music
has subsided. But it'you happen to be one
of the few who enjoys listening to
standards arranged loi big bands. The
xll'l‘tlllgt‘l’ could be lor you

The album highlights Mulligans ability
to arrange arid trace his musical
progression as an arranger from I‘Mo to
1957, Featured among the well-known
standards are “H IW High the Moon".
" Disc Jockey .lump“. “l'.le\ation“ and an
interesting prc\iously unreleased cut ot
“All the lhings You Are" doiic by
Mulligan.

Many litre musicians play on this
album and sortie notable soloists are Lee
Konitz. Red Rodney. Bob lii'ookmeyer
and Zoot Sims. Mulligan‘s written parts
are meant to stand in sharp contrast to
soloists improvisions without restricting
their freedom to improvise.

These recordings are old and while they
are not of superior fidelity they are well
within listenablc limits. Columbia has
wisely left the recordings in state-of—the-
art monaural. apparently deciding not to
add the nois‘ and hiss normally found
with electronic simulations of
stercophonic sound.

If you enjoy big band music you need
look no further as to what album you
should next add to your collection. The
Arranger is a good disc representative ot
the fine work Mulligan has done as an
arranger.

Adjoining Suites

liy DENNIS S(‘lll£\’liR

A/tec Iwo Step are a good example ol

enuinely pretty tunes like “Bakin‘” and
he historical ‘The‘Resurrection of Dean
Moriarity.“‘The second album “Second
Step" was their most popular and
deservedly so. It featured more electric
guitar. and well mixed vocals. The 1976
effort. “Two‘s Company“ had more of the
same and that was the problem.

Shulman and Fowler ﬁnally got smart
on “Adjoining Suites.“ They got Vini
Poncia. (Melissa Manchester‘s genius) to
produce and added four permanent
members to the band. They are Gordon
Cohen on keyboards. Mike Finkclstein
on drums, David Gross on bass. and
David Sleight on electric guitar. All are
credible musicians and give the album a
very full sound.

As far as the vocals they are the same
two-part harmonies we have come to
expect with perhaps a little more
excitement about wltat they are singing.

“Wonder If I l'ricd" opens the album.
fill: guitar work is similar to that ol
l‘ii'efall: the vocals approach l'llL'
Carmen. An unlikely combination. but it
works.

"Looking Glass" features tight guitar
work by David Sleight and innovative
keyboard work by Gordon Cohen. “Up
In Lilly‘s Room" would have been a great
single had it been released last summer. It
is the usual saga of a loose woman who
was “the light of the boys lil'e!“ Whether
we need another song about the subject is
questionable. but it‘s lun.

"Adjoining Suites" is an cl'lort lroiri a
hand that has been discmered hm not
exploited. I think they preler it that way.
but I think they wouldn‘t mind baring the
money to make more ot the good music
they made in the past ten years. Check
this album out. it‘s pretty good.

I mention this because the cover

Draw The Line
Aerosmith

 

By Al. BACA

Aerosmith has gained notoriety as one
of the top heavy metal bands in the
country. Their music is raucous rock and
roll at its best. and the release oftheir new
album. Draw the Line. proves this point
to be trite.

liven though many people say that
hcaiy metal has reached a \irtual derid-
end in that all bands are merely recycling
each others riffs and words. Aerosniilh
still possesses sornethingthat makesthem
unique. Perhaps it is Steve l’ylcr‘s
screeching meals. or the slick proditction
of Jack Douglas. but they are one ofthc
few bands that |nercrtircol'listeningto.

Although the new albiiiri reﬂects no
change in the Aerosmith formula for rock
and roll. ilic music is a definite listening
requirement lor devotees of the band.
Draw the line consists oi nine cuts.
including the title track. which is the new
single. although it has yet to get mttch air
play.

lhe best ctit on thealbiiin is“ngs and

medieyal days. It is interesting to itote
that this is the oiin song on the album
that sounds almost completely diller‘cnt
irom prc\ioiis \eiosmith material It has
an almost orchestrated sound that begins
as a classy ballad. builds tip to a rowdy
rocker. tltcn ends lll ballad loirn.

Another excellent cut is "I Wanna
Know Why." a song which is unique in
that ll contains some sex work, rarely
loiirid on ‘\L'l‘t)Slllllil albums. It also
lcatiires sortie surprisingly good
harmonica playing by lylet'. lher'eisalso
\ttlllt‘ piano to be heard ill the
background.

Although the rest ot the albums songs
are good. they probably would not hcas
appealing to the general public as they
wotth be to detotees. t)l course. “Draw
the | me" is geared toward mass appeal
since it is thealbirm‘s single. bttt llceltltat
.i better single would be either"Kingsand
Queens." or "I Wanna Know Why"
because they would be more likely to
create new Aerosmith fans.

On an additional note. Al Hirschlield.

New York limes. designed the cover lor
Draw the line, He has ltrddcrt the word
Nina. his daughter‘s rtarnc. three times in

locate the three "Nina's." especially it you
