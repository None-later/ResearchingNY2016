The Affirmative Action Office is developing

a plan which will be completed in March or
April and this plan will not only establilh
goals for hiring and promoting women in

rind underutilized. but goals and timetables
will be cstriblishcd for minorities. This fact was
communicated to the reporter who
inadvertently ommittcd it.
0n the subject of goals versus quotas. I
indicated three factors used to establish
rcrrlistic gorils and they rirc: (l) the national
availability pool of minorities and women; (2)
the current rcprcscntrrtion of minorities and
women in the department rind (3) the
deprirtmcntiil attrition rritc. Only thc first
lrictor was reported in the article, thus giving

Potential For Truth

There must be some element of truth e or at least the potential for ‘

truth — amid the ﬂurry of accusations; lawsuits and counter-suits
surrounding the Judy Liebowitz tenure case.

it will not be found, though, in the‘questio'ns being raised now. Should ’

Leibowitz have received tenure? Did Szoverffy use his position as
chairman of the department to unfairly inﬂuence the outcome of those
hearings? Was the Comparative Literature Department cut solely to rid
the University ‘of an “embarassing mess"? How politically and/ or
personally involved did the Task Force become in making its
recommendation that the department be cut?

After three or four years, these issues will be settled according to
whose memory isjudged to be most trustworthy, whose memos are most
comprehensive. There is no possible truth to be arrived at here, simply
an eventual settlement.

The questions that should be asked refer to the larger issues dredged
up by the Liebowitz affair. Of primary importance is thetenurc process
itself. Who really understands it? Do its greatest shortcomings lie within
the complexity of the process itself? Shouldn‘t there be larger doses of
precision and professionalism in tenure proceedings?

Another point worthy of examination is the extent that politics and
personalities play in both tenure decisions, and the administration’s
budgetary and resource allocation decisions. There is probably no way
in which to eliminate these elements completely, but their effects on the
shaping of this University can certainly be minimized.

There is. then, a potential for truth; a potential that can only be
realized if the University is willing to conduct its operations farther out
in the open. There is evidence that the Comparative Literature
Department is not alone in its suffering; with several State Education
Department reviews coming up, the University cannot afford to
continue this madness in its method. Only by presentingthese university
processes clearly for the scrutiny of the community can some level of
change ~ and truth - be achieved. ~' ' d "
