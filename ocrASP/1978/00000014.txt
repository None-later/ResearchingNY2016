moonlit;-
tinuing to“ heap praise upon him,
those who} know Joe Namath'best
seem to agree that his retirement
from professional football was not
’ untimely. <

“Our game has lost a great player
and genuiner ﬁne individual.“ said
Los Angélés Rams General Manager
Don Klosterman. who perhaps saw
Broadway~Joe,a_t;vli_i_§_w/orst.

" Th‘e' " M—year-old Jan}

down with newsmen today to talk
about it. spent the last year of a
record-replete. lit-year pro football
career with the Rams.

And it was that year —— which he
spent primarily on the sidelines
that convinced him it was time to
pack it in.

"In the brief time that he was with

 
  

us,” Klosterman said. “Joe Namath
contributed to our football’team in
many. many ways —— even though he
didn‘t play a great deal.
Best of Everything

“The Rams wish him the best of
everything in the future."

The two men at the other end of
Namath‘s pro career, however. felt
the quarterback had made the right
decision.

Alabama Couch Bear Bryant. who
polished the football skills that
Namath would eventually bring to
the pros. said: “He‘s in a position
now. if he wants to retire he can
certainly quit playing.“

"I liked to watch him play." said
Bryant. who coached Namath from
1962 to I964. “but I'm just happy
that he‘s in a position to retire when
he wants to.“

When Bryant gave up the All-

American quarterback. it was to
Sonny Werblin. president of the
New York Jets. who signed Namath
to an unheard- of 5425.000 contract
in I965.

“I think Joe isia very intelligent
young man who knows where he is
every minute." Weblin said at a
cocktail party in Miami where he
was attending the Thoroughbred
Racing Association Convention.

“lfhe thinks it‘s time to retire.then
hehas made the right decision."
Werblin said. “I wwish allefootball
players handled themselves'as well as
he has. His public image is nothing
like his private image.

“He happens to be a superior
human being. and I love him.“

It was Werblin who saw the
qualities in Namath that would
change the face of modern
professional football.

Vida Remains Quiet In Own Case

NEW YORK (AP) Vida Blue. the
principal in the Vida Blue case. isthe
only person in this complex matter
who has remained silent. It is a fair
question to ask: "Why?"

The best analysis. after talking to
several baseball people familiar with
Blue and the case. is that Blue can‘t
say what he really thinks because of
his fraud suit against Oakland owner
Charles 0. Finley.

Blue. the disgruntled Oakland
pitcher. was traded by the A's to
Cincinnati last December for $l.75

 
 

 

 
   

 

  
 
  

 

u;

JANUARY 27, 1978

"v... trait",

million and minor league first
baseman Dave Revering.

People who know Blue best say
that he really wants nothing better
than to leave Oakland and his No. l
nemesis. Finley, lhey also say that
pitching lor a powerhouse like
Cincinnati would renew his love for
the game

But his legal position has to he
different because ol the lawsuit. A
victory in that case would make Blue
at free agent. which logically and
financially would be at much better

deal than being assigned to
Cincinnati.

The background of the lawsuit is
that in June of I976. Blue had
decided that his business interests
and friendships made it preferable
for him to stay in Oakland » no
matter how much he hated Finley.
He signed a three—year contract on
the eve of the June l5 trading
deadline after. he said. receiving an
assurance from Finley that the
owner wouldn't trade him.

Finley. however. immediately

turned around and sold Blue to the
New York Yankees for S|.5 million.
Blue then sued Finley. claimingthat
Finley fraudulently coaxed Blueinto
signing a contract. thus erasing his
chance for free agency.

The case was weakened. however.
by baseball Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn‘s eventual voiding of Blue‘s
sale to the Yankees. “How can he
claim damage when he wasn't
t raided?"

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

So. for the sake ofthe fraud case
against Finley. Blue must assume the
posture of wanting to remain in
Oakland and playing for the
Oakland owner. “the man.“ as Blue
calls him.

Knowing what Blue really thinks
of Finley. it is not illogical for himto
remain silent. lest his true feelings
about leaving Oakland make their
way into a newspaper and then
before the judge's eyes.
