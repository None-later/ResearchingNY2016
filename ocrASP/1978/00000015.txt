Martin And Whité‘Drive' Away In Class

NEW YORK (AP) I-larvcy Martin
was reflecting on the fancy new cars
he and Randy White received
Wednesday as co—winnct's of the
Super llowl XII most valuable
player award.

“ l be right way would hai c been to

flat Sport Maga/ine. which has
never had to go for more than one
car before. thought two would be
sufficient this time and Martin arid
White drmc them off.

How did it come down to Martin
and Wliitc'.’

"I don't know." shrugged Maitin.
‘ I wasn't toting that day. just
playing.

“I feel like we're representing the
whole defense." Mariiii continued.
" loo lall Jones. Cliff Iltirris..lctliro

White had no argument with that.

"We play together itnd we realize
what we hate to do." he said. "We

The Dallas defenders played a
major role in tile Cowhoys‘ 27-10
Super Bowl victory over Denver.
earning the cars for Martin. who had
two tackles and two sticks in the
game. and White. who had ﬁve
trickles and one sack.

“Winning the Super Bowl. . . that
was number one." said Martin.
"Everything else is extra.“

Wednesday‘s extra was parked in

side. it could look like a Cowboy

quarterback.

“Playing next in Harvey. . . well.
it makes tlte job easier." said White.

“He‘s a great guy. it great

competitor. Ilc studies hard and we
work together as a team.“

“Our defense is prc-plitnncd." said
Martin. “It‘s not haphazard."

Neither was the C‘owhoys' Super
Bowl victory

"A lot of otir guys had been there

two years before when we lost to
Pittsburgh." said Martin. “We were
in awe of the Super Bowl the ﬁrst
time. And we realized afterwards
that we could have won that game.
That loss made us more dedicated
for the Denver 'giunc. Most of the
gtiys hung around the hotel and
studied during the week. Not many
went down to Bourbon‘Sircet and
that stuff. ‘l'here‘s plenty of time in
the off-season to party.“

White. whose season ﬁnally ended
in Monday night‘s Pro Bowl game
at Tampa. isn‘t sure he‘s reti'dy for
that off-season.

“I‘m excited about next year." he
said.
