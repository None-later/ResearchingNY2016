Police in Moscow have broken up a

flourishing underground market in I i

blue jeans arresting three members
of a youth gang.

A Communist publication reports

jeans; another stocked them; while
the third did the market research and
selling. They were reportedly buying
the western-made dcnirns from
\‘isiting foreigners and then selling
them for about $200 a pair to young
Soviets.

To make matters even worse. the
three had allegedly used false police
ll) cards to swindle sortie of their
customers. I hey reportedly
sometimes pretended to he police

President Carter is apparently no
fool when it comes to pre-empting
television shows.

Newsweek magazine reports that
Carter personally overruled
suggestions from congressional
leaders that he schedule his annual
State of the Union message for the
night of January 24, What
happened. Newsweek says, is that
January 24 is a Tuesday. and that
happens to be the night when three
oftlietop—rated 'I'Vshows.“ ' '-
and Shirley.“ "Happy Days." '
u'l Iirec‘s Company." are all shown in
prime time.

In aricffort to keep poteiiittl voter‘s
happier. Carter instead chose to pre—
empt shows on January l9. I978. a

BREATH EASY

Marijuana smokers in Laredo.
Texas. can toot on their pipes a little
easier now. '

That's because "Smokey." the
marijuana-sniffing dog who
escaped. has been captured and is
back on the job.

After Smokey Went AWOL.
customs officials iii Laredo feared
the worst for the town‘s pot-users.
Smokey was reportedly trained to
attack anyone toting weed around.
and police officials recalled that it
few years back. when another pot-
sliil'l'ing canine got loose. it hit a local
resident in the leg who was carrying
some illegal grass in his pocket.

Smokey reportedly was captured.
however. by a resident of Mexico.
after he found the pot-sniffing dog
wandering around in it marketplace.
taking in the sights. and smells. of
Mexico.

IN THE AIR
If a researcher in Sweden is
successful. a giant prehistoric

l’tcrodiictyl (pronounced lliR-o-

IML'A-til) will fly again.

Naill Muteer', In English
researcher’ at Sweden‘s 'Uppsala
University. is attempting to
construct a perfect replica of the
giant ﬂying reptiles that have been
extinct on the earth for 100 million
years.

His model. he hopes. will weigh
the same as the extinct creature.
about 40 pounds. and will be able to
fly.

Mriteer is attempting to duplicate
the creature by using a small motor
for a heart the will power the wings
and constructing its ﬂesh out of
something called “skumplast.”

Mateer says he has used statistical
studies on a computer to figure out
how the prehistoric reptile was able
to fly.

The researcher reports that
st iidents of the dinosaur are not the
only ones interested in his project: he
says that “The flight industry.
especially in tlic US. has for a long
tiriie been interested in building
planes with soft wings." He saysthat
by imitating the I’terodactyls. sonic
booms could he eliriiinatcd and
shorter landing strips could be used.

The Citrus Commission is‘ use of
the major-sponsors of ,the annual
Florida Citnis Open.“ a ..sports,
tournament. Christmascardsma'iled '
out by citrus ofﬁcials this year were
supposed to contain the lyrics to the
song "Deck the Halls."

'The card that was sent out
included l4 lines from the famous
carol. but it deleted two lines. one of
them reading “Don we now our gay
apparel.”

The tournament directors and the
Commission both insist that the
deletion was completely accidental.
and had nothing to do with the fact
that the word “gay” was mentioned
in the missing lines.

Commission Executive Director
Edward Taylor said that this is the
first. and will probably be the last.
time the commission sends cards.

The haunting adventure of a drained journalist who
