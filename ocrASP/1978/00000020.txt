Ask anyjazr bull'to name their favorite
keyboard player and one of the most
common answers would be McCoy
'l'yncr. voted Jazzn'ian ol' the Year in the
I976 Downbeat Magazine Reader‘s I’oll.
His album “'lrident“ took second place.
but he was voted the number one acoustic
pianist.

l'yncr began his climb to lame as a
member of" the John Coltrane Quartet.
and playing with such greats as Steve
l)a\is. Art l'aylor and fellow ('oltt‘ane
member Elvin Jones.

His recent albutns "l-ocal l‘oint“, “Hy
with the Wind" and “ l'ridcnt“ have been
both successful and artisticallyfulfilling.

His popularity was reflected last Friday
night as an audience braved the poorly
plowed roads to reach Union College
Memorial Chapel to see lyneriu action.

Tyner‘s latest ensemble is a sextet
consisting of Gary Bartt; soprano and»
alto saxist. clarinetist. and llutist; Ron
llridgewater. also on flute and soprano
and alto sax; Charles Fambrough on
acoustic bass: Eric Kamau Gravett on
drums and (iuilherme Franco.
percussiotiist.

The material performed included
"lilvin Sir Jones“ which was not only
longer that the version on “ l ridcnt" but
featured some of the ﬁne improvisational
charting that 'l'yner is known for.

"Mes 'l'rois His“ and "Departure"
leatured several outstanding solos
particularly and intriguing excursion into
avant garde percussion by (iuilherme
I‘ranco. He used everything from a
wltashhoard to whistles and the inside of
his drum skin to achieve his sound.

l'yncr‘s exclusive use oi the acoustic

piano was a relief from the usual barrage
of electronic gimmickry. His use of
moding. running up and down an octave
with only the white keys ol'the keyboard.
is a welcome addition to the use ol'chords
by other players.

The sextet were all musicians of the
ﬁnest calibre, and the three and a half
hour show was ﬁlled with intricate
rhythms throughout.

Although Eric Kamau Gravettis not as
suited a drummer to Tyner as Elvin
Jones. his playing was well above the,
norm. Charles Fambroughs bass line was
solid. and both Gary Bart: and Ron
Bridgewater played poworful horns.

The only major flaw in the concert of
ﬁrst class progressive jazz came during
the intermission when the audience was?
assaulted by the music of the Pousettc
Dart Band; a ridiculous choice of a
backup band.
