Indoor Trackmen Finish A Distant Fourth

by Ed Gibbons

Despite outstanding perfor-
mances by Don (iross and Jeff
Baker. the undermanned Albany
State indoor track team finished first
in afield of four colleges. Saturday.
at the Williams College Indoor
Track Meet in Williamstown. Mass.

Springfield College won the meet
with a total of 52.5 points. Following
Springfield was Lowell University
with 47.5 points. Williams with 42
points and the Danes with 2|.

Nevertheless. track coach Robert
Munsey was pleased with the out-
come as he watched the Danes ac-
cumulate more points in the meet
than he expected. This prompted
Munsey to predict that within the
next month the team could blossom

into the best indoor squad he's ever
coached at Albany.

Two first-place finishes and two
new indoor records highlighted the
meet for Albany. Sophmore Don
Gross leaped 2i feet. 9 inches to win
the long jump and freshman Jeff
Baker ran the 440 yard run in 52.2
seconds to win first place and set a
University record in the process.
"Baker just exploded from the
blocks in the 440 and won by at least
ten yards. I’m really excited by his
progress." Munsey said. Erik
Schultz. another freshman. finished
fourth in the 440withatime of 53.7.

Gross. though. had the most
productive afternoon for the Danes.
As well a: his long jump victory.
he finished second in the 600 meters

with a time of I: I6.4 and anchored
the mile relay teirin to 3:32] clock-
ing. good for second place and a new
Dane indoor record. Also in the mile
relay for Albany were Brian Cuddy.
Baker and Schultz.
Prominent Freshman

Another freshman was prominent
in the Albany scoring. Sean Reilly
ran zi 4:29 mile. good enough for
third place. He also anchored the
two-mile relay team ofJim Spanglcr.
Bill Mathis and Steve Dcieskewicz
to it third-place finish in 8235.3;
a time Munsey said Was terribly slow
but added. “then so was everyone
else's."

Some humor was irddeit to the
meet in the l000-meter race as the
runners printed across the finish line

in an unusually grueling race to dis-
cover that they ran an extra lap.
Albany‘s Jim Spariglcr finished
fourth in the race in a time Munsey
said he doesn't think he'll coutit.
Coach Munsey is encouraged by
the performance of all the freshmen.
"I'm excited to watch the boys com-
pete. knowing they'll improve and
gain poise." said Munsey. Reilly

whose time was good enough for i

third. ran a 4:l9 in high school so he‘s
going to come on strong and Baker
and Gross have been great so far.
“Gross. who usually gets his best
jump in the beginning of the com~
petition. won Saturday on his final.
jump. beating out it boy from
Lowell. As soon as we get more prucqi
ticc we'll be tough." said Munsey.
