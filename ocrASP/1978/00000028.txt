“The difference between what we
needed and what the bank offered
was at least 520.000,” said Sokol.
“We needed a 20 year mortgage. and
the bank demanded we accept a
fifteen year one, and there was no
way we could work with that."

The batik gave no reasons for its
decision, but several possible
explainations for the bank's
demands were advanced by Student
Dwellings boardmembers. all of
which seem to centeraround the idea
that the bank apparently considered
the project a risk of its funds
unjustified by the terms advanced by
Student Dwellings.

“inexperience may have been one
factor,“ said former Director of
Residences John Welty, Vice
President of Student Dwellings.
“This was an initial venture by
Student Dwellings. we had no track
record, no credit rating. I‘m surethis
may have raised some questions.“

Welly also discussed the
possibility that because Student
Dwellings would be renting to
student tenants instead of moving
into the buildings as a homeowner,
the mortgage‘payments might suffer
as a result ofthc inability to rent the
apartments for 12 full months a year.

Karlson said that additional
funding of the projectgby SA would
have reassured the bank of the
corporations ability to meet those
payments.

“if we had had more money, say
another $10,000. we could have put
more money down. and the bank
would have felt it wastakmgless ofa
risk."

DiMeo said that it was important
that the project not be considered
strictly as an SA project. but should
expand to involve ‘the whole
University community. This is
particularly important if the
organization wants to “tap other
sources" for funds. such as the
Alumni or the Benevolent
Association.

This "expansion" has apparently
not occured. Karlson said that the
Benevolent Association had been
approached,nor had anyone
suggested it. Vice President for
University Affairs Lewis P. Welch,a
Board member of Student
Dwellings, said that although the
University Administration had been
“helpful and supportive" of the
project. it had not attempted to seek
funds for or use its inﬂuence to aid
the Student Dwellings project. He
said this was because the project was
“SA initiated." and had never been
proposed as a University fund
raising project. '
