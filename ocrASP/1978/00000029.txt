' TANK TOPS

If you‘re looking fora way to relax
or to quickly “get away from it all."
you might consider a John Lilly
Isolation Tank.

Lilly is the reknowned biologist
who is best known for probing ways
to communicate with dolphins. As a
government researcher. Lilly also
became involved in "sensory
deprivation“ experiments to deter-
mine what happens when you cut off
all information fed into the brain by
the senses.

He eventually decided to build his
own sound-proofcd tank. about five-
by-seven feet in size. 'filled with
about IO inches of warm still water
heated to the temperature of the
hirrnan skin. The idea is that a person
cart climb inside. pull the lid shut.
and cut offall the sounds. lights. and
other distractions of the bustling
outside ivorld. Once inside. you
reportedly lloar in blissful silencc.

\ltiss I:ltcl'g_\ l’r'ojcct iii Wtishington.
Ilt'. clrargcs that the Colorado
accident rcvcalcd serious
inadequacies in the ability ol public
and pi'i\alc agencies to deal with
spills of radiotictnc materials.

lltc report alleges that three days

tot

went by before clean-up operations
even began; that health ofﬁcials did
not arrive at the accident scene for l2
hours; that government nuclear
ofﬁcials showed up for the ﬁrst time
seven days later; that the area's
background radiation level rose 44
times its normal level; and that the
public did not even hear the news
until a Boulder newspaper ran a
story on the spill a week later.
warning people who had been near
the site to wash their clothes and to
shower to avoid possible
contamination.

The Critical Mass report says the
Colorado incident raises what it calls
“a rather frightening spectre of what
will happen when other more
difficult radiological accidents
occur."

TV VIOLENCE

A new study by the US.

('orilcrcticc of Mayors lountl that
tune deadly weapons appear during
an average action show on
television. and that as many as 4]
weapons have appeared during a
single progrrirn hour.

'l he researchers report they

action programs. noting the

says that “the presence of so many '
weapons leading to so few injuries
creates a gap that suggests that
ﬁrearms are less harmful than they
actually are.“

The study also found that virtually
no blood or "guts" were seen. When
people die on TV. the study says,
they usually do so neatly and quietly

out of camera range. Says Gunther:
“This represents a distortion of the
most serious nature. Viewers must
be made aware that pain. suffering
and trauma result from a bullet or
tab wound."

BIG BILL

If you‘ve ever been overcharged by
an auto mechanic. you'll love this
story. It all started when Zina
Zhadan left her car tor repairs.
iliinking it had a dead battery. and
returned to face a repair bill of
$|952.52.

A Superior Court jirry or Los
Airgclcs last week awarded Zhadan
more than $95,000 because of the
incident.

lIicjtiry lottnd that not only had
Zhadtrn lriilcd to autliori/c the
nearly $2000 worth ol repairs. but
that the garage had impounded her
car since the dispute arose, llic 30—
)ctit'-old car owner was awarded
$5260 tor the car's \nluc. plris an
additional 500.000 in pittiitrtc
damages for truitd.

SUN & SALT

Ihc (iciicral I’lectrrc Company
says its scientists are working on a
cheap way to use a common salt to
store solar energy.

lhe coirrpany says most solar
energy systems use tanks of water or
bins til rock to store heat from the
suit for rainy or overcast days.

Now. GE scientists say they have
found that when put in slowly
revolving drums containing special
sccd crystals. glauber‘s salt becomes
a good heat rclttincr. The salt turns
itiio a liquid as it absorbsihc energy.

and freezes into crystals again when
the energy later is released.

General Electric says that a tank
holding about 800 gallons of salt
would be capable of storing one
million British Thermal Units of
heat. enough to warm it home for
about a day.

JOB HAZARD

Being married to a psychiatrist
could be enough to drive you crazy.
. According to a new State Univer-
sity of New York survey. “a signiﬁ-
cant portion" of the spouses of psy—
choanalysts who were interviewed
reported that their married partner‘s
involvement in psychiatry was hav-
ing 'a detrimental effect on their
marriage and on the raising of their
children.

Nearly one third of the 4M who
were questioned blamed their
spouses analytical training for in-
creasing tension and strain in thcir
relationships and one third said that
lacing the spouse of a shrink had
succeeded in driving them to the
therapist’s couch.

REVIVAL MEETING

The House Committee on Internal
Security. also known as the House
Committee on llritinicricari Ac—
ti\itics during the McCarthy era.
may soon be revived.

I’oliticks maga/inc reports that
r'cprcsctitativc Larry McDonald has
gathered I72 Congrcss members as
cosponsors of a resolution to
reestabliin the Committee on Inter-
irtil Security.

In I974. the Ilolrsc voted
ovci'wliclmirigly to retain thc corn—
mittee. but it was abolished iii 1975
after the Democratic caucus voted to

write its demise into the rules of the ‘

94th Congress.

Now. Politicks says. many
members of the House are eager to
investigate terrorism and its impact
on public security and safety; a
mandate to investigate terrorism. in

PRESSURE BUILDS

If and when the state of Illinois
ﬁnally ratiﬁes the Equal Rights
Amendment, no one will be happier
than the Chicago business establish-
ment.

The Christian Science Monitor
reports that the city has lost an es-
timated SI million in convention
business as a result of national
boycott against states which have
not ratiﬁed the ERA.

What’s more. the city elders are
predicting that if the boycott per-
sists. the city could lose more than
SIS million in the next ﬁve to ten
years. Business lobbyists. the
Monitor reports. are beginning to
lean heavily on state politicians to
get the measure passed.

Passage of the ERA in Illinois re-
quires a three-ﬁfths majority in both
chambers of the legislature. So far.
the issue has come up five times
already. and has been narrowly
defeated each time.

Miami. Las Vegas. New Orleans
and Saint Louis are also reporting
heavy business losses as a result of
the national organization for
women-sponsored boycott.

FOOTBALL MACHINE

Computers are moving into the
violent world of professional foot-
brill.

Apex Data. a Los Angelcs data
processing ﬁrm. reports it has been
supplying computer-constructed
game-playing strategies to at least 17
teams in the National Football
League. _ 

The company tells Coni-
putcrworld magazine that it has been
using an IBM 370/158 to analyze
and catalogue every offensive and
defensive play of each NFL team.
Apex Data says it utilizes this infor-
mation to develop what it calls
"tendency" reports for opposing
coaches.

The information includes downs
and distances. formations. plriys.
penalties. fumbles. interceptions and
Mines. As an example. if it ctincli
wants to know what his up-coming
opponent has done on all previous
