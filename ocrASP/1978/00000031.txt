Good Work Turns Up
In Unlikelies‘t Places

By STEPHEN ALMASI

The only artist who consistently
escapes SUNYA art gallery shows witha
preserved sense of honor is Irena
Altmanova. The rest oftlie regulars there.
back-patting comproinisers that they are.
always give the feeling that each has
something to learn from the others but
refuses to do so. l'his latest collection of
their works is no exception.

The show is titled (jrtrp/it‘t- sir/[SIS of
New lurk. Nodow'nstaters or westerners
are represented. The organi/ers might
have titled it Graphit- .‘ll‘lf.\'l.\ of The
Universe and not been any less correct.
This display isn‘t even a good cross-
seetioii of Albany's graphic art. let alone
that of the Empire State itself.

Let me first consider someone i
personally know. As an Albany State
Studio Art major and graduate. I‘ve had
Thomas O‘Connor several time as a
teacher. He once graced a student. who
labored several hours over a single
drawing. with these golden words of
criticism: "i don't like it." Now. she was in
effect paying him ninety dollars a
‘ for this sort of incisive advice.

Fortunately. my review here isn‘t going to
cost Mr. O'Connor a cent. As regards his
own work. “I don‘t like it" either. 

Comparing Altmanova‘s pastel pieces
to O‘Connor's attempts in the same
medium yields some definite ideas. One is
that persons such as O'Connor (who
titled all six of his drawings “Untitlcd")
ought to wear signs. placed comfortably
about the neck. printed with the word
"Untitled". That way. the rest of us
squares can stop insulting these aesthctes
with proper names.

Another is that some merciful patron
ought to subsidi/e O‘Coiiiior's paper
purchases. His six drawings. combined.
cover less surface area than Altiiianova's
smallest. He told me once that the size has
an aesthetic effect. I rather think that the
larger paintings of the modern New York
School (such as those on exhibit last
month in Albany's State Museum) iiitist
ha\c giien him agoraphobia (the fear of
wide-open spaces). Postage-stamp
collectors. to be sure. will love him.

If Sharon Ellis could get oft'hcr“(iray
Power" kick. we might be pleased to see
some variety in her work. Enough of the
old decrepit women, sympathetically
drawn. that grace the tear—jerk pages of
the Albany Times-Union almost every
week.

Susan chinan-Rogcrs deliberately
ll\0ldS any centering in her compositions.
Miro. Jandisky and Dali should cover the
analogies. Perhaps her work is einpticr
than theirs.

“Poor Man's Pollock" is a lit
description for Robert (‘artmcll‘s Luna
Park II. His (horror/t Street. perhaps not
surprisingly. looksjust like its title. Dawn
at Oshi'ma resembles the combination ofa
lithographic printing accident with Luna
Park II. Variations on a Slut arid Circle, I
fancy. escaped from some architectural
draftsman's wastebasket.

Frisbee maven Mike Ringo devotes
half his dining room. nearly all of his
bedroom. and the whole back porch of his
flat to storage space for his collection of
about |000 Frisbees. In the past year, he
has spent almost $2000 acquiring the
Ilyitig platters. Inventory of his collection
and correspondence with other collectors
keeps him busy over an hour a day. But.
all things being equal. Mike has no
