"Watermark" .
Art Garfunkel
Colour/rid .l(' 14975

 

 

By DENNIS SCHEYER

There is no need to review the careers of
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. Suffice to
say that they were the most inﬂuential
musical duo of the latter sixties.

Paul Simon was the songwriter. Art
Garfunkel. the harmoni/ct'. Nick Logan
of the New Mtisieal Express described
(iarfunkcl as: “playing a minimal role; he
simply provided the close harmonics that
helped give the duo a distinctive sound.
Simon was the dominant creative partner
and it was uncertain how much Garfunkel
would achieve as a solo artist when the
dtio split up in l970."

So. Garfunkel has no writing abilities.
But, he can takea love songand make you
melt! All this leads up to his latest release
’ Walcriiiarlr.

The albums songs are written by the
' king of pretty music Jimmy Webb. l’hil
Ramones‘ production is lush. but clear.

Garfunkel has the equivalent of a
supergroup on “Watermark.” Musicians
include; The Muscle Shoals Rhythm
Section. The Chieftans Pete Carr, David
Crosby. Stephen Bishop, .loc Osborn;
and even Paul Simon!

"Crying in My Sleep" was released as a
single a few weeks ago. it is a beautiful
ballad oflove in the styleol"‘A|ll Know.“

The highlight of the album is the re-
workingoftheSamCookcelassic."What
a Wonderful World." (iarltinkel is
accompanied on the meals by Paul
Simon and James laylot. lhe tempo is a
lot slower than the original. bttt It is
destined to be a hit.

l'Vult‘l'Illrll‘lt' has been a standard oii my
ttirntable ever since I rcccitcd it. it is an
album to listen to by candlelitc, and w lien
is the last titne you bought one of those'.’

 

“Kluln' In the Calllor‘nlo Sun"
Kay Mottol
Columbia J(.' 3477‘

 

By PETER HOFFMAN
in the past year, there has been a
barrage of releases by new female
vocalists. Surprisingly, most have been
very good. They all appear to have their
own distinct musical styles and none seem

 

y to be imitations of better known artists on

ALBANY STUDENT mites

 

  

the order of Linda Ronstadt or Carly
Simon. Of the albums released in I977.
the best have been the debuts of Karla
Bonoff and Valerie Carter. Now, in l978,
We have the new album of Kay Moffatt.

I first approached this album with
some reluctance. The title and the very
subtly lewd cover made me wonder if we
had a western Donna Summer on our
hands. I was very surprised to hear how
good the album really was.

Moffatt has a very soft. pure voice;
probably closer in power to Valerie
Carter‘s than to anyone else. It‘s major
distinction is the slight Texas twang that
comes across in her singing. It adds a
cuteness and vulnerability to her songs
which isn‘t annoying.

()f the album's tcn songs. hall were
written by Moffatt herself and only two of
those are very good. “Didn‘t We Have
Love" and “ Take Me Back to Texas" are
both excellent showcases for Moffatt‘s
vocals and they profit greatly lrom (ilen
Sprccn‘s lush but sparse production.

Moffatt really shines on three of the
songs she has borrowed Icorn others.
Among them. two are redone oldies;
“Urn.Um,Um.Um.Um.Um“ by Curtis
Mayficld anti the old Driftcr‘sclassic “Up
on the Roof“ written by Carole King and
(icrry (ioffin. 'l he former is the album‘s
sultricst song. Sprccn‘s arrangement gives
it a subdued funky feel and the loneliness
which the lyrics project is deeply felt. The
latter is simply a song about getting away
from it all in the tenements. Moffatt hasa
feel for the lyrics and when listening to her
sing them one forgets about the originab

The album‘s standout is Carole Bayer
Sager and Peter Allen‘s “I‘d Rather Leave
While I‘m in Love.“ lyrically. it is the best
songonthe albumand it also hasthe most
sophisticated arrangement. Moffatt‘s
rendering is amaling for the sheer power
of it.

Kissin' in the California Sun is the most
consistently good album by a female
vocalist since the release ol lionofl‘s
album almost six months ago. lhc twang

“In Color. And In Black and Whlto"
Cheap Trlck
Epir I‘liJ-llllll

 

By Al. BACA

Perhaps one of the strangest looking
groups around today is Cheap Trick.
whose debut album In Color. And in
Black and Whita, also marks them as one
of the more talented groups to come on to
the current music scene. Cheap Trick
consists of Robin lander on lead vocals.
Tom Peterson on bass. Bun E. Carlos on
drums, and Rick Nielsen on lead guitar.

You may ask what is so strange about
this group. Well, for one thing two

mtcﬁftics, while‘Zunder and Peterson
look.” like {typical seventies style heavy
metal musicians. Lead guitarist Nielson is
a dendringer for Huntz Hall of the
Bowery Boys.

Despite
appearance, however, Cheap Trick has
proven themselves to be on of the most
talented and diversified bands to come
out of a very stagnant period of musical
creativity. They show a very original
style.‘are slickly produced. and have the
know—how to put together an impressive
debut album consisting often well written
songs of various structure.

Side one of the album starts off with
“Hello There," a solid rocker featuring
Nielson on guitar. The first few lines of
the song reﬂect what the group wants to
get across to the listener on the albtim.
“Hello there ladies and gentlemen. Are
you ready to rock?" l'rom here. the ttine

Thanks to the praiseworth) efforts ol a
group of excellent British actors. Rome
has come alive this winter. Using a W
scenario that is based upon Robert
Graves‘ two novels. “I. Claudius.“ and
“Claudius the God,“ they have been
presenting weekly an amazingly realistic
and credible recreation ofscenes from the
life ofthe imperial Julio-Claudian family.

The century of civil strife that had
broken out in Italy at the time of the
Gracchi came to an end with ()ctavian‘s
victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra
at Actium (3| B.C.). Nam-est bibcmluni.
Illllll' pale libero. “We must drink and
dance," Horace wrote ccstatically. A new
order had begun. At the head ofthe state
was Ocatavian. the grand—nephew and
adopted son of Julius Caesar. who was
soon to be hailed as Augustus, the father
of his country.

Augustus was ll‘lC/ll'lllt't‘ln. “first titan."

A king dies. Long lI\L' the king! in his
attempt to find a successor. l‘ate
peculiarly thwarted Augustus. llis sorr-

his only child. and she by his first wile)
died young. The able and popular Drustrs

Augustus‘ second wife) died
mysteriously. Agrippa, Augustus‘ old
comrade-at-arms. passed away. (iaius
and Lucius (Augustus‘ grandsons, the
sorts of Julia and her second husband.
Agrippa) died in the flower ol their
manhood. Augustus finally and
reluctantly named Tiberius (his second
wife Livia's older son by her first
marriage) as his successor.

Was it by Fate, or by Livia's
manipulation of Fate. that Tiberius
inherited the throne? The TV series,
following Robert (iravcs' novels,

name. Even the vocals are great. The
group displays definite talent in
harmonizing rather than shouting.

"Downed" is another excellent rocker
havmg to do with the relationship
between a boy and a girl. Once again. all
the members of the group work together
to produce a fantastically unique sound, a
sort of blending of sixties harmony with
seventies heavy metal.

Side two is every bit as good as side
one. lcspccially like Robin Zander‘s lead
singing. His voice reminds me of Robert
Plant at his prime. except Zander projects
his whole self into his vocal range.

The only criticism l could think of
while listening to this album is that
Nielson should be given a little more
freedom on guitar. Hc sounds almost
restrained on several cuts. l think it would
be a big improvement if he were allowed to
do a few solos. it would even serve as a
good balance to the harmoni/ing vocals.

Rome’s Lucretia Borgia

A principal source of our knowledge of
Augustus and Livia. as well as of their
successors, is a work entitled Lives ofth
'I'ii-elvc Caesars, beginning with Julius
Caesar and ending with Domitian. lts
author. Gaius Suetonius 'l‘ranquillus,
commonly known as Suetonius, was born
shortly after the death of Nero (A.D. 68).
As a young man be practiced law and
later entered the imperial service. where
his secretarial duties at the palace gave
him access to the archives. His scholarly
proclivitics. encyclopedic interests, and
literary talents combined to make him a
popular writer. one who was inﬂuential
long after his death. 'l he last known event
of his life was his dismissal from the
imperial service by Hadrian in l2l922.
along with some others, for an
unspecified breach ol palace etiquette
that involved the empress. ()ne‘s curiosity
is pro\okcd but not satislicd. Suctonius
presumany devoted the rest of his life to
the ctrltivation of belles lcttres. His
eognomcn Tranqutllus CL'Ililllll) denotes
pcacefulncss.

In his life iii'ztiigioim. Stretonius has
almost nothing but good to say about
l.i\ia. whencter he happens to mention
her. If one wonders whether Suctonius
wrote with a ccnsor's blue pencil in mind,
the answer mtrst be negative. For the
Romans of his time. the ptiblic and
pri\ate lives of the early Caesars must
ha\c been ancient history; what
Siretonius wanted to write he wrote. He
enjoyed the reputation of writing
truthfully. so candidly indeed that some
linglish translations omit certain
passages!

Not all Romans admired Livia. She
and liberius. her son the emperor. were
not on speaking terms at the end of her
life. Her great-grandson. the emperor
Caligula. according to Suetonius, called
her an Odysseus in petticoats (Ullxes
Alli/all”). Caligula; hchvcr. was
probably insane. and he was murdered
because of his insane acts.

lhere is no doubt that Livia was a
dominant. if not a dominating. person;
but it is fiction rather than fact to assume
that her maternal determination to see
Tiberius. her first—born son. sitting on her
husband's throne drove her. either by
herself or in collusion with Tiberius, to
poison all other aspirants. Robert Graves
