‘_ The Albany State basketball’team
found out last night just what it takes
to Win a game. Patience. ‘

The Danes defeated the RP]
Engineers last night 74-56 at
University Gym in a game which
belonged to neither team until eight
minutes remained. The win followed
an overtime loss to Union just two
days earlier. '

Leading 54-5] with just under
eight minutes to play. the Danes
went on a l4—2 scoring spree which
put the game out of RPl‘s reach. A
IO-footjump shot by freshman Rob
Clune. two Winston Royal layups. a
Hurry Cavanaugh jump shot and
reserve forward Calvin Joncs‘ l5-

half alone. The largest lead Albany
had was four points at 4-0 and 33-29
which is how the halfcnded up. The
Engineers led by as matiy as three
points at 25-22.

Almost half of Albany‘s first-halt
points came from forward Carmelo

the game as Cavanatigli and forward
Kevin Keane scored four and six

 

 

points. respectively, to give Albany a
43-35 lead. But RPI fought right
back and pulled within thrce on
Mike Chapman's three-point play.

The Danes regained their
composure and opened up another
eightjpoint lead only to see Rl’l cut
it back to three at Sit-5|. That is
when the Danes made their game-
breaking spurt.

Coach Sauers substituted freely
throughout the game and with good
reason. “The reserves were a key
factor in the game." said a pleased
Albany coach. Jones played one of
his best games of the scason."llc
(Jones) was a big help off the
defensive boards." said Sauers.
Jones grabbed five of Albany‘s 43
rebounds Rob Clune. who started
the game in place oftlic ailing Buddy
Wleklinski. ﬁnished as Albany's
second leading scorer with l3 points

Swimmers Rout Union 84-28

by Mare Sheinbaum

Coming off its first defeat of the
season to Potsdam last Saturday. the
Albany State men‘s swnnming aiid
diving team came back strong and
demolished Union College 84-28.
Wednesday. at University (iymfl'hc
Great Danes never trailed point-wise
throughout the meet.

Freshman Joe Shore exemplified
the winning style with a strong
performance in the ZOO-yard
breaststroke. He turned in his
personal best in the first loll-yard
split with a blazing 1105.5. and
finished up tying‘his record with a
time of 2523.

  

In only one event did the lfnion
team finish in the top position. the
[UGO-yard freestyle. Yet even that
victory was overshadowed by the
gutsy swimming of sophomore l’d
Watkins. Watkins narrowly missed
nosing out the victory. Other than
that. Union barely challenged the
stronger Danes team.

"We tried to keep the score dovin."
claimed coach Ron White. "It gate
us a good chance to move people
around and take the pressure oil the
top notch swimmers."

One person who benefited from
the switches was sophomore
Stephan Stroms. He finished first in

if the Danes can stay in present

DNA Research Facility Installed

by G. Pascal Znehnry

Equipment needed to complete
SUNYA‘s recombinant DNA
research facility was installed today.
but work involving the controversial
genetic research procedure will not
begin until the facility has been
inspected.

The cotnpletion of the facility ltad
been delayed for nearly six months.
as the Biology Department waited
delivery of a “bio-hood." an
important safety feature. A further
delay occurred when SUNYA
biologists discovered that the hood
was too large to fit into the Biology
building's elevator.

The problem was solved when
another bio-hood. small enough to
fit into the elevator, became
available in mid January. The hood
had been used by Professor Norman
Dulak. who left SUNYA to take a

 

position at a research institute.

While federal safety guidelines do
not require the use of bio-hood for
the level of research being planned at
SUNYA. all research utilizing the
recombinant DNA technique will be
conducted in the special lab that has
been built on the third floor ol'the
Biology building.

Community Concerned

The added safety precaution grew

otit of several public hearings

conducted by the Biology
Department when members of
SUNYA and the community

expressed their concern at the use of
a research technique described by
some members of the scientific
comtiiunity as “potentially
dangerous."

“The bio-hood is a standard piece
of micro-biological apparatus whose
purpose is to prevent contaminants

Carey Proposes Cutting

According to the (iovei'nor‘s

Opportunities Grant program and
the state 'I'Al’ awards. Snyder raid
that these increases will provide llil

[he reasoning of the Governor's
Office is that even with this proposed
cut iii EOP. students will still be
receiving $54 more per year.

"i his will create a broader biiscd
financial aid program." said Snyder.

SASU Legislative Director David
Coyne said that the purpose of
federally funded programs such as
llli()(i is not to relieve the state of its
financial burdens. but to supplement
state aid to students. He said that
adjusting the amount of money

increases in Ill-.00 ttiiids is not in

Withdrawal Bill Returns To Senate

by Bob Blnsensteln
and Cindy Caren

A bill proposed at the last Senate
meeting giving instructors the right
to refuse a student a withdrawal
front a course was sent back to the
Senate for clarification by SUNYA
Acting l’resident.VincentO‘Leary.

After reviewing the bill, O‘Leary
sent it back to the Senate to clarify
paragraph three which reads. “The
instructor has a right to refuse to
authoritc a withdrawal only when
there is a compelling reason sticli as
cheating. The reason shotild be
strong enough to warrant a possible
grievance or disciplinary hearing."

According to SA Vice President
Kathy Baron. student arguments
helped convince O'Leary it) send the
bill back to the Senate. Baron. SA
President Dave Gold. Senator Lori
Gastworth. UAS President ’atil
Feldman, Cctitral Council (‘hiiir
Mike Lissner. and Vice Chair l‘red
Brewington met with O‘Leary arid
raised tltc question of the specific
nature of a "compelling reason."

“We didn't ask for a veto; we're
happy with the way he handled it.“
said Baron.

According to student Senator
lltigli Hill, the bill was originally
p roposctl at an lixectitivc
Committee meeting last November
2! and introduced by the
Undergraduate Academic Council

two weeks later. After passing in the
Senate. the bill was sent to O‘Leary
for ratification.

In a memorandum sent to
University Senate Chair Donald
Bishko. O‘Leary stated that
"instructors. because of different
interpretations of the meaning of a
‘compelling reason'. are likely to
refuse to assign a ‘W‘ for quite
disparate reasons."

As a modification to this section.
O‘Leary suggested that it an
instructor feels a 'W' is an
inappropriate grade fora student. he
or she mtist fil- a request with the
Registrar and liuvethe case reviewed
by a proper University body before
the appropriate academic grade can
be assigned.

the current Withdrawal policy
does not state whose signature is
necessary for dropping a course; a
student‘s instructor or the student‘s
advisor may sign the drop card. lti
addition. the instructor cannot
refuse to sign the card if a student
desires a withdrawal Under the bill
proposed. only the instructor can
sign a student out of a course. and
only at his or her discretion.

if it student is accused of'cheating.
tlte burden of the proof is placed on
the student. as he must prove himself
innocent. Under the revised bill. the
burden would be shifted to the
instructors. who would need

According to Gold. SUNYA
students thought the new bill was a

In (lold‘s opinion. the bill seems

At SUNY Buffalo. dropping a
course is allowed only up to Feb. 24.
lhts is done in many cases by
computer which gives immediate
withdrawal. or by course request
form. which takes a few days.
Neither of these processes requtre a
instructor‘s signature.

Although SUNYA has the fittest
day to drop a course of the tour
centers. May 8. it could be the only
one to give instructors‘ the right to
refuse a withdrawal to a student
wishing to drop a course.

Ilie bill is presently at rest and Will
