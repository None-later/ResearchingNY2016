..open' a wine and cheese cafe this

semester in the Campus. Center
Patroon Room. Abbie Havkins.
who is managing the operation with
fellow UAS Board member Anne
Markowitz. said the tentative
opening date is Friday. February 24.

UAS will provide the ﬁnancial

backing for the project and staff it
with paid workers. ‘ v

The cafe will provide live
entertainment, primarily by solo

performers. Havkins said the new ~

cafe will probably draw from a
different group of people than either
the Rathskeller Pub or the Freeze-
Dried Coffee House. and so won‘t be
in competition with those places.
Planning for the cafe. still without
a name. began last semester.
Havkins said. It was conceived of as

'a reasonably priced on-campus

alternative to already existing
entertainment spots.

The cafe will be open each Friday
and Saturday night with tentative
hours from 9:00 pm. to 1:00 a.m.
Patrons will be able to buy a variety
of cheeses and soft drinks. and wine
will be served by the bottle. Itali-
bottle. and glass.

Havkins said the name of"Norb's
Place." after UAS Director E.
Norbert Zahm. has met with
approval by some Board members.
A contest to get other suggestions is
being considered. he said.

said Evan. a business major.

“If you want a job. you have to go

lntensil‘ying this pressure to
achieve good grades is the anxiety of

Peter. a I973 graduate olSUNYA

GIFT IDEA

This must rank as one of the most
unusual wedding gifts ever received:
Lynda Byrd Johnson Robb told a
TV audience on the Merv Griffin

show on the eve" of her wedding to

Charles Robb. her father. who was
then the President of the United
States, came into her bedroom.

According to Lynda Byrd. LBJ
was carrying in his hands all of the
FBI‘s original files on the husband-
to-be. Then. as a wedding present to
the young couple. the President
reportedly destroyed the files in
front of his daughter's eyes.

One unanswered question. of
course. is: What was in them‘!

SMARTEN UP

A new Canadian study has found
that "liberated" commercials are
more effective in selling products
than are ads which feature the

 
 
 

 

 
 

stereotyped “harried housewife.”

Researchers from York University
report that they measured the
reactions of audiences to
commercials showing women in
both liberated and . non-liberated
roles.

A typical "liberated" ad showed
members of a family at breakfast.
each ﬁxing breakfast for themselves.
instead of “being waited on by
Mom.“ The old-fashioned ad. in an
example. depicted a woman chided
by a man for having spotted
dinnerware.

The researchers found that
audiences tended to watch and
identify with liberated ads much
more closely. They concluded that

BIG BUSINESS

The business publication Forbes
Magazine is reporting that the
market for cigarette rolling papers, a
market that has been sky-rocketing
in recent years. may ﬁnally be
topping out.

The reason for this turn of events.
the usually-conservative publication
says. is that. in the magazine‘s words.
“fat joints are out."

Forbes credits the growing
popularity of marijuana for pushing
the rolling paper industry to an
incredible $200 million-a-year
business. However. the magazine
adds. the price of an ounce of dope
has jumped in recent years from SIS
to $50. causing smokers to conserve
their weed by rolling thinner
cigarettes.

The magazine says that smokers.
who used to use two papers to roll a
joint. are beginning to use only one
for the thinner smokes. As a result.
sales of papers are declining.

SPACE CAR
Wisconsin Senator William
Proxmirc has given his “Golden

     
    
   
  

Fleece of the Month" award for
January to the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration for that
agency‘s attempt to produces space-
aged police car of the future.

Proxmire says that the Federal
agency spent $2 million on a
prototype patrol car that ended up as
“an earthbound space ship on
wheels."

What is this 2lst century squad car
all about? Here‘s the way Senator
Proxmire describes it: “A policeman
who was thrust behind the wheel of
this ‘wonder car‘ would have a lot on
his mind besides besides crime
prevention and law enforcement. In
addition to driving the
vehicle . . . he would have to worry
about his multiple spark discharge
ignition system while grasping his
hand-held voice/digital terminal
while reading his heads-up display
while listening to his audio recorder
while looking at his wide-angle
persicope rcarview mirror.

“lfthis didn't keep our belcagured
patrolman busy enough.“ the
Senator continues. “he would be
further occupied by the need to
check out his tire sensor. his brake
wear sensor. his catalytic
converter/exhaust temperature
sensor. and seven different condition
sensors.

“On top of this. he would have to

Residents of Ann Arbor.

fatally injured in simulated auto
crashes by the University of
Michigan‘s Highway Safety
Research Institute.

The animals are scheduled to be
anesthetized. and then put while
unconscious into cars which will be

The animals. the Research Institute
says. will then be “terminated”
before they wake up from the car
crashed. and the results analyzed.

The Research Institute insists it
needs to use live baboons in order to
develop better plastic “dummies” to
use in future tests.

PLUTONIUM CAPER

An Oklahoma Federal 'Judge.
presiding over the ‘Karen Silkwood
case. has disqualiﬁed himself after
being challenged on possible
conﬂicts of interest by attorneys for
the Silkwood family.

US District Judge Luther
Rohanon has removed himself from
the “60,000 civil damage suit after
Silkwood attorneys complained that
Bohanon had been appointed to the
Federal bench by the late Senator
Robert Kerr. Senator Kerr was the
father of two defendants in the suit,
Breene and Robert Kerr. Jr. The
men jointly founded and own the
Kerr-McGee Corporation in
Oklahoma.

The Silkwood family is suing
Kerr-McGee, alleging that the
company negligence was partly
responsible for the death of 28-year
old Karen Silkwood in a mysterious
car accident in Oklahoma three
years ago.

A new judge. Frank Thies. from
the Federal Court Bench in Wichita.
Kansas. has been appointed to preside
over the complex case. Silkwood
attorneys indicated they are at least
temporarily satisfied with the new
appointment because it marks the
first time ajudge from outside ofthe
State of Olkahoma has bee
appointed to the two—year old case.

The $|60,000 suit accuses Kerr-
McGee officials and the FBI with
harassing and illegally wiretapping
Karen Silkwood while she was
investigating safety violations at the
Oklahoma facility shortly before her
death.

The attorneys say they are
hopeful a court hearing can answer
questions as to how the fatal car
crash occurred. how plutonium was
planted in her apartment and what
happened to documents in the car
that were reportedly missing
immediately after the crash.

WHO?
What's in a name?
One hundred-twenty

communications students at the
University of New Mexico found out
recently when they were asked to
identify 15 prominent persons.

One student thought McAllister
Hull was a new ship design for the
Navy. Hull is that University's
Provost.

Another identified French
President Valery Gisgard D'Estaing
(Val-eh-REE Zhees-CAR Des-
TANG) as being an “exotic
restaurant“ in Albuquerque.

And still another student wrote
that New York mass murder suspect
David Berkowltz was. in fact. a close
adviser to President Caner.
