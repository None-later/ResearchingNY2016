indoor track and ﬁeld victory of the

Ire now l-J.

‘fThcre was no way we could have
lost the relay,” said Albany coach
Robert Munscy. As for the win,
Munsey didn‘t expect it. “I thought
they'd probably take on pretty
easily.‘

Dross also captured first place in
the 600-yard run in I:l7.2,and in the
longjump. leaping 25'2". Baker and
Shullz were successful in other
events, as well. They placed first and
second. respectively. in the 440-yard
hurdles.

In the 50-yard dash, Albany's
Benny Smith was the victor,
clocking a 5.6. He edged out
lcamrnalc Jimmy Pollard. who had a
triumph of his own — the 55-yard
hurdles.

Although Albany won six of IO
cvcnts. Munsey Was not plcascd with
the times. “Every time was terrible,“
said Munscy. “I don't know why. it
was a slower truck apparently." It
might have been the conditions of
the R Pl Ficldhousc. as Munscy
indicalcd that inside 1! was “icc
cold."
