NEW HAVEN. Conn. —- An
Albany State 140 scoring spree at
the start of’tlte second half and a
pressuring. parsimonious defense
led by Winston. Royal and Willie
Bellamy guided the Danes to an easy
78-55 victory over Southern
Connecticut Saturday night. '

With three steals each in the
second half. Royal and Bellamy
sparked the Danes. whose play had
been lethargic in the first half.

Losing39—36 at halftime. Albany
ran off 14 unanswered points toturn
the score around to 50—39. In the
scoring spree. center Barry
Cavttnaugh hit an assortment of
shots. hooks, 20—«footjumpcrs and
six~foot jumpers to lead Albany‘s
onslatIght.

As the Ditnes' offense was burning
the acts. the defense limited
Southern Connecticut to 16
second—half points.

The Dancsjumped out to a o 0
lend as reserve center Kelvin Jones
scored two quick baskets. llui
Southern Connecticut‘s lony
Gardner led the Owls on a
comeback. giving them a 23 15 lead
at one point.

This part oftlte game looked like a
rerun of last Tuesday's infamous
Union game as the Owls paraded to
the foul line and Dune Conch Dick
Saucrs frequently sprung up front
the bench to disagree with the
referees. But then a hoop by
freshman guard Robbie Clune and
two baskets by Royal and
Cavanaugh trimmed Southern

 

agers’ SecondHalf—Pla‘y L

Connecticut's lead.

With” 19:20 left in the. game.
forward Carmel Verdejo connected
on a layup to give Albany the lead
for good at 40—39. Cavanaugh then
said: a jumper and Buddy Wleklinski
scored on a layup as a result of
Albany's stiﬂing defense. '

After Wleklinski‘s basket. Royal
stole the inbounds pass and put in a
layup to give the Danes another two
points—or so they thought. An error
by two scorekeepers and a negligent
scoreboard operator failed to count
Royal‘s basket because they didn‘t
see it. This delayed play as Sauers
became furious. “I‘m counting that
basket even if you don't.“ he told the
scorekceper. “And why did the
scoreboard go from 42 to 44 and
then back to 42'!" queried Saucrs
incredulously.

Royal was also angry. “What the
fuck were they watching when I stole
it?“ Royal said.

The dispute merely triggered the
Danes into playing their second
consecutive excellent game as they
built up a lead of 65 ~46 before
substituting freely. Coach Saucrs

said of the win, "We played a tough.
aggressive defense in the second half
and we ran on them well.“ An
indication of the Danes‘ defense was
the Owls terrible 33 per cent ﬁe1d~
goal shooting.

“We have gotten a lot ot team
togetherness and spirit now so 1 can
start many combinations and they
will work well. Barry and Bellamy
played very well for us." Sauers said.

Cavanaugh led all scorers with 19
points and he pulled down 11
rebounds. also a game high. Royal
and Verdejo each added 12 points for
the 8—7 Danes. Tony Gardner led
Southern Connecticut with 12 points
as the Owls dropped to 7~|0.

Albany's next game comes on a

road trip next weekend as they play

Vol. LXV No. 5

SUNYA‘s wPsychology
Department has re-establishcd its
research subject pool under
guidelines meeting New York State
Department of Health human
subject safety standards.

The srtbjecf pool was abolisltcd by
Acting SUNYA President Vincent
O‘Leary iit December after the
Health Department charged
SUNYA witlt failing to obtaitt
“informed voluntary consents" front
ll utiintt research subjects. It was also
charged that the subject pool was
maintained by means of cocrciott.
This charge stemmed from a
requirement that all littrodtictory
Psychology students either
participate lll rcscarclt experiments
or write :1 term paper.

Ilie Psychology Department has
formulated a revised research
rcqriireriiertt in conjutictiort with the
University Council for Research.
Under the new guidelines. students

page paper. or participate iii five
hours of human research approved
by SUNYA‘s lrtstrtutiomtl Review

Psych Subject Pool Guidelines. Set

The new guidelines call the
research requirement "equivalent in
spirit and rationale to the concept of
laboratory courses in biology.
chemistry. and physics." ‘

“The whole spirit of the
requirement is to give thestudents of
Introductory Psychology a grasp of
concepts and methodological
principles.“ said Psychology
Department Chair Gordon Gallup.
“We don't ltavc the wherewititall
citltcr lll terms of pcrsottitcl or
equipment to have each and every
student participate in a lab “

Advance Warning

According to Vice President for
Research Louis Salkcver. all
students who choose to participate
as subjects in research projects will
be warned in advance of any risk
involved. and will have the right to
withdraw from the experiments at
any time.

According to Salkever. stridents
who sign up for experiments are
ex pressing their availability to
participate iii research and not
committing themselves to a
particular project.

“A smart operator cottld just sign
tip and just keep refusing projects

  
 
  

and still receive credit." Salkcver
said. .
Alternatives to participation as a
human subject “must be clearly
equivalent or less" to this kind of
research. said Salkever. He said this
was achieved by correlating five
hours of research or five hours of
colloquia attendance with a five—
pngc paper.

“What was wrong with the old
policy was that it involved nit
clcmctit of coercion.“ said Salkcvcr.
"The stress in the new nrrartgetiieitt is
that it is completely volunteer."

The State Health Department ltad
also charged SUNYA with violating
ccrtaitt U.S. Department of Health.
Education and Welfare standards
for the conduct of humatt subject
research. This involved shocks
administered to student volunteers
and the use of faulty equipment. fit
one incident. a SUNYA student was
burned by a higlt intensity lamp.

“Graduate students are otit doing
research rind they're rtot yet aware of
all the restrictions that faculty
members are aware of.“ said
Salkever. “We were just
unfortunate. he said. "We got
caught iii the middle.“

UAS Will Not Increase
Board Rates Next Year

byMltcheIl Drsch

The UAS Board of Directors
decided Wednesday in a unanimous
vote to maintain student incai punt
rates at their present levels next year.

The Board's decision comes
despite a predicted loss of S1 15.000
for [MS next year. According to
estimates compiled by UAS General
Manager 12. Norbcf Znhni. meal
plan rates for next year would have
to be raised 3% for the corporation
to break even.

“ The decision was an 'asy one to
make becutisc it entailed no serious
difficulties for the corporatiott." said
UAS President Paul 1"e1diiinn.

Projected Profit

According to Felditian. retained
earnings accumulated over the past
six years cart ensin cover the
minimal loss predicted for next year.
lit this fiscal year which ends June 30.
UAS will Itnvc 1| projected profit of
npproxiiiintely 3170.000.

Zaltm did not oppose the decisioit.

"Though I like to cover our
expenses. 1 think the decision was a
fair and reasonable one. That is not
to say that thcrcarcn‘t risks involved
in the decision. Food prices are hard
to predict and they could turn otrt to
be a good deal ltiglter then we've
estimated.

“There is also the possibility that
UAS will hrtvc to pay for utilities
next year. creating aii additional
expense of anywhere front 540.000
to $70.000. With these uncertainties
there is the possibility thitt we will
run into problents ttcxl year."

The meal plan rates was the only
triple discussed at tltc Board
meeting. Though all University
students arid faculty members are
ctttitlcd to nttetid lloard meetings
according to UAS by-lnws. only
