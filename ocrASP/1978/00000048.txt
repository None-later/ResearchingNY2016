These stipends would serve to
compensate undergraduates who
hold positions of "absolute
necessity” in“vital" SUNYA groups.
according to the policy passed by
Central Council last semester. The
policy requires that positions entail
“considerable personal sacriﬁce in
the areas of part time work and
school work “in order to qualify for
an award.”

In addition. the policy states that
individual stipends are limited to
$250 per semester and that total
stipend distribution should not
exceed one percent of the total SA

Applications from groups for
stipends are currently being accepted
by the committee. A deadline for

Stipends hare been aWarded in
previous years without any formal
policy 'or procedure. Because .of
delays‘in getting the approved policy
instituted some applicants may be
awarded stipends retroactive to last
semester.‘

Committee Delayed

Gross attributed delays in forming
the stipend committee to problems
of “getting people together" and
agreeing on a method to select a
chairman.

The stipends awarded to the SA
President, Vice President. and
Controller‘will not be subject to
review by the committee. The policy
sets them automatically at $522.50
for the year and SI04l for the
summer.

The committee is also currently
studying the possibility of awarding
academic credit to certain positions
in place of stipends. said Gross.

SPORTS = 33$

‘ Ralph Nader's new sports
consumer group called “Fight to
Advance the Nation‘s Sports.“ 0r
"FANS" for short. is alleging that
professional sports in America has
been heavily infiltrated by large
conglomerates.

FANS director. Peter Gruenstein,
suys in an interview with Playboy
magazine that the roster of team
owners today reads like It guest list of
a Fortune 500 gnlii. Gruenstcin says
that corporations with a piece ofthe
action in professional sports include
(lqu and Western Industries; CBS.
Ritlston Purina; Warner
Communications; General Electric;
and the Ford Motor Company.

(irttenstein says that a few dozen
companies and wealthy individuals
are making millions in profits off
sports for two reasons. because
(‘ongress hits exempted some of the
sports front anti-trust laws: and
because sports fans aren't aware of
the profit picture in the sports world
and blindly pay higher prices.

As all example. (iruenstein says.
\cw York taxpayers. wltilc lighting
oll' bankruptcy. spent SIlIlI million
to refurbish Yankee Stadium lor the
liltancial benefit of Yankees‘ owner
(icorge Slcinbruner. He points ottt
that the IV networks pay $60

DULL DISCS

The quality of record albums
produced and sold in the United
States is said to be inferior to those
made in Europe and most other
parts of the world.

The music trade publication
Cashbox reports that its own survey
of the record-pressing industry has
found that American companies
have improved the quality of their
discs in recent months because of the
growing complaints from customs
about warped records and other
imperfections in brand new releases.

However. Cashbox adds that
many US record makers openly
admit that foreign-made records are
lstill clearly superior to the domestic
products. The record makers
reportedly say that mass production
of records in America. apparently
needed to' keep up willt demand. is
responsible for poor quality records
here.

TUNE IN

Extra-terrestrial civilizations may
be tuning in to our television
programs of the mid-l950‘s.

An astronomy team at the
University of Washington says it hits
analyzed what the earth might look
like to beings with radio telescopes.
located on planets at least 25 light
years from the earth.

The astronomers report in the
current issue of Science magazine
that the most obvious signal to
intelligent creatures elsewhere would
be our daily TV broadcasts.

TIIL‘ scientists say that creatures on
nearby planets receiving these
beacons could use even the faintest
of them to deduce the orbit of the
earth, the presence of the moon and
even the presence of irregular
weather patterns here.

In terms of the programs
themselves. beings 25 light years
away would just be receiving the
early days of "I Love Lucy“ and
newsclips of the Korean War. 'I‘hcy
would probably wonder if there
really was intelligent life on the

ROCK VIOLENCE

Three men working for rock
promoter Bill Graham ﬁled criminal
charges and a $2 million civil
damage suit against Led Zeppelin
members last summer. after thethree
were reportedly brutally beaten
during a Led Zeppelin concert
appearance in Oakland.

Tltc three Graham employees
charged in their suit that they were
physically beaten up by Led
Zcppelin‘s manager l’eter Grant.
drummer John Bonham and two
other road crew members after a
backstage argument.

Now. San Francisco Chronicle
rock columnist John Wasscrman
reports that an out-of—court
settlement was nearly reached over
the incident. when the settlement
suddenly fell apart.

Wasserman says that the three
(iraham workers had agreed
reluctantly to settle fora payment of
537.500 from the English rock
group. when a strange letter arrived
from Led Zeppelin attorneys.

’l'ltat letter reportedly asked the
three Graham workers to sign
statements agreeing that their
versions ot the beatings last summer
were incorrect. and that new facts in
support of Zeppelin members have
since come to light. In addition. the
proposed "public settlement" was to
be cut back from $37,500 to a mere
$500 each. with the remaining
$3|.U(Il) to be quietly disperscd
throuin a “trust account.“

DELETED

The authors of two best-selling
books about the turbulent l960‘s are
reporting that the television
adaptations of their works are
deleting almost all references to
drugs and politics.

One of the authors is Sara
Davidson. whose big-seller "Loose
Change.“ a story about three college
students in the 1960‘s. will be shown
as a four-night special this month by
NBC. Davidson reports she has
looked in vain through the final ‘I'V
scripts for references to pot-use and
anti-war activities. She reports that
these elements have simply been
removed from the TV version of
“Looge Change."

The other writer is Michael
|Medved. who co-authored
“Whatever Happened to the Class of
‘65?.“a Thursdaynight program also
on NBC. Says Medved: “I‘ve seen
five hours of the show, and not one
ever mentioned marijuana when it
was a decisive factor among the
kids."
