Journey

By DENNIS SCHEYER

Journey is one of the few supergroups
around today. The personnel have
changed since their first two albums but
the roots ofthc group are still strong, with
guitarist Neil Schon and keyboardist
Gregg Rollie, both of who were original
members of Santana.

Drummer Aynsley Dunbar started
with John Mayall‘s Bluesbrcukcrs. Later
he became a member of the Mothers of
invention and when Flu and Eddie left
the Mother's to strike out on their own.
Dunbar accompanied them.

New additions to the band include
Ross Vttlory replacing rhythm guitarist
(ieorge Tickncr and ll new \oeulist Steve
Perry.

“Wheel in the Sky" opens tlte album. It
is at basic rocker with a beat that makes it
highly danceable. The meals resemble
Boston not so much in their qunlit) or
texture but in their intensity.

The quality ol the musicianship is
credible throughout. Rollie‘s keyboards
and Schon‘s guitar rock enough to mukc
your toes tup.

it‘s not whutlexpccted. but it you liked
Boston, Foreigner and others 01 that ilk.
Journey's Iii/inin is a wise choice.

Joy McShonn

By APRIL PETITT

Jazz pianist Jay McShitnn. like so
many of the great jazz musicians of the
late 30‘s and early 40's. got his start in the
Kansas City nightclubs. His brand new
recording, The last aft/w Blue Devils.
recreates the music that made MeShztnn
popular then.

In Kansas City, the Yurdbird. Charlie
Parker, was part of the Jay MeShnnn
Orchestra. Their reputation. however.
was somewhat overshadowed by the likes
of the Count Basic and Duke Ellington
Orchestras.

Today Joy McShann has it new band
consisting of one original member of the
McShann Orchestra. saxophonist Paul
Quinchette, and from Count Busic‘s
hand. both Buddy Tate on sex and Joe

type jazz and is a fine combination of
blues and swing. “Blue Devil Jump,“
"Jumpin‘ at the Woodside," “Hot
Biscuits“ and “My Chile“ are four very
lively numbers in which McShann plays
cxuberantly. “Just For You" is a ﬁne solo
performance by McShann. and on
“Hootic Blues," he plays electric piano for
the first time on record.

Throughout. McShann sings with deep
gusto. and plays piano similarly. Each
musician has many small solos. and
playing together. each answer well to
McShann's phrases. The Last oft/re Blue
Devils is a thoroughly enjoyable album in
which Jay McShann proves he is still an
excellent and very versatile jazz pianist
who hasn't lost his touch.

 

“No Place To Fall"

Steve Young

 

By ROSS JACOBOWITZ

Steve Young is a country and western
singer whose littest album. No l’ltit‘l‘ Io
l’ull, puts him alongside such Nashville
poets its Jerry Jeff Walker. Kris
Kristoll'crson. and lownes Van Zandt.

it is no coincidence that Young uses a
Van Zundt song as the title cut of the
album since both men cover similar
territory on their albums. Both offer
images ofdrifters and dreamers who must
always lose in love.

Young‘s greatest asset is his voice. It is a
raw, powerful. instrument which enables
him to project feelings of hurt. loneliness.
zind del‘innncc. He uses it best when
covering other people‘s songs.

One might laugh zit the prospect of
doing 21 country version of Dobic (irtty's
hit. “Drive Away." but Young does an
excellent rendition of the song. using
strong, primal vocals. Tracy Nelson ltclps
with the singing chores on this one as she
does on three of the other songs.

The highlight of the album is Young's
cover of liob Dylan‘s. "Don't Think
Twice. It‘s All Right." The song is given
nn uptempo treatment and Young singsit
in tin ironic triumphant tone which
counteracts the meluncholia ofthelyrics.

Young includes four original songs on
his album. 'l hrec are slow. dreary, bulads
ol the you—lclt-me-und l‘m-lecling—so-
blue variety, I he other. “Montgomery In
The Rain." is it song recounting the “you
can‘t go home again" theme. The song
contrusts beautifully haunting images
with it sad tale of alienation.

Steve Young‘s, "No Place To Fall." is
an album of successes and failures. The
failures have mainly to do with Young‘s
ability as a songwriter. but on the basis of
his “Montgomery in The Rain," there is
the hope that this problem may be
corrected in the near future.
