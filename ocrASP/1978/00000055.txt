During the last two weeks there
has been plenty of action in WIRA
sports. ln volleyball the teams have
been ﬁghting to secure a playoff
berth which will go to the top four
teams.

Tw0 weeks ago Tower Girls won a
big match over DMT, IS-ll, IS-l3,
to hang on to first place. The
ClintoNets squeaked by the Outlaws
in three games, l5-2, l3-l5. l6—I4.

The Ragers defeated TNFTS l5-

! l, 15—6, to stay in second place while

Tennis Enthusiasts Decrease In Number

NEW YORK (AP) Lost: It) million
tennis players.

Last sighted. they were wearing
$50 shorts. $25 shirts with a
crocodile on the chest. $65 wnrinup
suits and $45 kid shoes. 1 hey were
carrying two $75 racquets in a fancy
satchel and were racing toward the
closest indoor bubble.

Anybody seen ‘em‘.’ Where did
they go? And Why’.’

“Just got fed up,“ the Sports
Training Institute of Chicago said
today in reporting on what it
pictures as the greatest mass exodus
since Moses led the Israelites out ol
the wilderness.

Within the past decade. tennis
became the fastest growing
participant sport in the country. Its
ranks mushroomed from six million
timid souls — almost cmbarasses to
be seen with a racquet under their

arms ~ to a bustling 30 million who
went dcliriously mad over the
pastime.

It was the "in" thing. You couldn‘t
go into an airport without seeing
scores of travelers lugging court
equipment under theirarins. Indoor
complexes moshroomcd. Real estate
couldn't be cleared last enough to
build the courts in demand. Sporting
goods stores. instructors. publishers
and promoters prospered. Ihc
tournament players became the
millionaire elitists ol professional
sports.

Wave of l)iscncltaiitntenl

nate ol disenclnintnicnt set in

What happened?

It was a question the Institute
decided to learn for itself, so it
assigned researchers to student
dropouts. instructors and court
operators. This is what they found.
Listen to the deserters first:

“Learning was not fun, It was
actually quite frustrating."

“I was making a fool of mysell'out
there."

"The hyped—up advertising arid
promotion made you feel like a
second-class citizen if you didn’t
hate S75 racquet. $25 shoes and
color coordinated warmups."

“ll ii guy says. 'No. I don‘t want to
play. I just like to hit 'cni.‘ he‘s
considered some kind oI nut."

lennis did not gite me the excieise
oi the trim figure I expected."

"there are laslcr ways to get a
workout."
