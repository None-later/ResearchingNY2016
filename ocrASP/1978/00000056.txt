The Albany State junior Varsity
basketball team played a game last
Tuesday night. and something
unusual happened; they lost. The
visiting jayvees came close. but
ultimately fell to Mohawk Valley
Community College 75-74.

Albany came out looking sharp.
primarily due to the inside play of
Steve Low. The Dane guards
attempted to get the ball inside to the
front line. and many passes found
their targets.

Especially effective was 6—4 Low.
who scored Id of his game-high 25
points in the first half. Low‘s
offensive aggressiveness produced
many layups and short jumpshots.
and this resulted in one ofthe highest
individual scoring outputs of the
season for the jayvees.

inspired by Low. the Danes rolled
to a 42-2“ halftime lead. not an
unaccustomed position for the team
to be in. However, a situation that
developed in the first half turned out
to play a major part in the outcome
of the game. Albany‘s center Jimm
Bittker was called for three fouls
early in the game. forcing coach Bob
Lewis to substitute for him much
earlier than usual.

“The fact that Bittker saw limited
action hurt us tremendously."

 

  rrv~'cage..s.rr..‘ Romeo...

« commented Coach Lewis. “if he had

been 'in for the whole game. ldon‘t
think they would have been able to
contain him.”

In past games, the jayvees would
amass a large lead and then coast to
the victory. Mohawk Valley refused
to quit when they were behind. and
the second half turned into a tight
ballgame.

Mohawk Valley began to play
aggressive defense. and Albany
started to have problems getting the
ball inside. In a complete reversal. it
was now Mohawk Valley that was
setting up for easy shots. “Wedidn't
run our offense as well as we should
have.“ stated Lewis, “and they hurt
us inside with their big men. We did
not do a good job holding them.“

Comeback

Despite the comeback. the Danes
were still in good shape going down
the stretch. Then. after losing Bittker
on fouls. Albany also lost guard
John Battle. who suffered a knee
injury and was forced to leave the
game with seven minutes remaining.

“Battle did a real finejob coming
in off the bench." said Lewis. "He
helped us defensively and with the
ballhandling. and he was a tough
man to lose." Battle left the game
having scored eight points.

In the last l:30 of the game. the

 

Danes had numerous opportunities
to pull out a victory. They went to
the foul line three times in a one-and-
one situation, and were able to

'convert on only one freethrow. For

the game. the Danes made only l2 of
the 22 freethrowa. and that is not
good enough, to win close games.

With five seconds remaining.
Albany had one last chance. “With
possession of the ball. there was only
enough time for one shot for the
Danes. A good shot was taken. but it
wasn‘t good enough. The miss
handed the jayvees their second loss
in eleven games.

“Mohawk Valley played a fine
game." stated Lewis. “They are a
much better team than their record
[7-9] indicates. because their losses
have been in extremely close games."

On the subject of close games. the
jayvees have lost their only two
games by a total of three points.
putting them in competition with the
varsity team for most frustrating
losses.

The jayvees played Albany
Business College last night and face
Adirondack Community College on

'Sunday. They return home next

Tuesday to face. Junior College of
Albany in their final home contest.
The team ﬁnishes up the season with
live away games.

Vol. LXV, No. 6

by M. J. Mcmmott

An external evaluation of the
Speech Pathology Department was
completely misinterpreted by the
Task Force on Priorities and

Resources. according to one ol its
ttutltors. University of Conncticut
Professor. Harry S. Cooker.

In March I976. tlic lask l-oi'cc
recommended phasing out Spccclt

“ the recent external evaluation
indicated that continuation ol tltc
existing programs would require at
rcirrnrping on the curriculum. the

upgrading of personnel. tllld more
cooperation among members ol the
department."

Statement a Distortion

statement a “Key distortion oi the

"('crtainly. the continuation ol the

Cooker wrote. “As i‘eiicwcrs. we

not salvaged",

The Task Force report went on to
say: “. . . the consultants‘ report
stresses that the appropriate
preparation for speech pathologists
is iii the graduate level. and they raise
serious questions about the viability
of the undergraguate progritm at
Albany.“

Emphasis Questioned

ltt his letter. Cooker disagrees
with this also. “Never was there any
question of the undergraduate
program‘s viability; Instead. the
advisability of continued emphasis
on the undergraduate program was
questioned. and it was
recommended that a shrlt in
emphasis to tltc graduate program
would be most appropriate til at
University Center. Clearly. tltcrc is a
rust difference between questions of
survival and questions ofcmphasis."

Availabilin Questioned

llie availability of funds for the
improvement of the Speech
Pathology Department was
questioned by thc‘lask Force. in his
letter. howcvcr. Cooker says.
 . . the facts in this mattcrarc that
the external review report contained

two and one half pages of
suggestions for reallocating current
resources to accomplish program
upgrading and husband scarce state
funds.“

He wrote that the department
could attract funds from outside
sources in the forms ofgrants. or fees
generated by a University operated
clinic. and that "added funding is rtot
vital to any of the suggestions for
improvement that were made by the
reviewers.“

No Explanation

Vice President for Academic
Affairs David Martin said last night
ltc hits no definite explanation for
the differing interpretations of the
Speech Pathology evaluation.

“It‘s as if you and l were reading a
newspaper article and geitiiig
different things out of it.“ Martin
said. “The Task Force certainly read
things other than just the outside
review during their process."

SASU Protests TAP Proposals

by (i. l’aschiil Zachary

Fifty students from four SUNY
schools pickctcd yesterday at the
Albany office of tire Commission on
Independent Colleges arid
Universities. the chief lobbyist for
New York‘s private colleges.

According to its organi/ers. the
SASU led demonstration was
held to publicize the need for boilr
public and private colleges to assume
a unified position in the face oi
numerous proposals uirtied til
modifying the 'IAP awards
schedule.

Presently tltc two advocacy
organinttions are divided on the
issue oi lAP reform. SASU
supports a bill which calls for an
across the board increase of 20% in
'| AP aid. known as the
Miller. Kremcr bill.

CICU favors Governor Carey‘s
plan to increase the ceiling on | AP
awards by $300. a modification
which would only aid private college
students.

The pickcting students. most of
whom had arrived from
llingltuniton. Oswego. or Oncoiita
ntinutes before the demonstration
began. carried posters and chuntcd
such slogans as "TAP Aid For All".

in response to the demonstration.
CICU called it news conference at~

       

which l-lcnry l‘alcy. its director. rc-
stated his organization's support for
the Governor‘s proposal. Paley
called it “a recognition of the ltiglicr
cost environment of higher
education."

SASU President John Diiggati
said he was “very pleased" with the
demonstration.

“it‘s iirnc we sturtcd trying to say
the same thing so the legislature
won‘t be able to play its oft one
another." he said,

After Picketing

At the close ol the picketirig.
ivlircli lasted almost an hour.
l)uggun and other students turned
to the Legislature wlicrc tltcy were to
rttcet with sorttc 40 static ltiw makers.
before the close of the day.

'l'hough labech an "invitational
picket“ by SASU stall. Paley said
CIC U had no idea that a
demonstration was to take place.
SASU didrrot coiritnunicrite directly
with CICU during the
demonstration. ltc said.

“We will talk to tlicrit on
’l'uesduy.“ SASU News Director Sue
Grossnian said.

The controversy surrounding the
TAP awards schedule was set in
motion towards the end of January
when Governor Carey released his
Executive Budget. In it Carey

 

 

proposed that the maximum ’l‘AP
award be increased from SISOO to
$ltllitl a year. This $30 million
dollars in additional financial aid
would he received only by private
college students since the current
maximum award exceeds the tuition
of SUNY and CUNY students.

Perry Duryeti. a possible
Republican candidate for Governor
in this year's electiort. also has
released a proposal to modify the
lAPrrwardsschedule.Similartothc
Viillcr/Ki'emcr proposal. Duryea‘s
would offer even a greater increase in
aid.
