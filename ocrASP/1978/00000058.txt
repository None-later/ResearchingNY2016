will condense the current card
catalogue system by about 3.4
million cards.

At the end of the year a new
Computerized Collection
Management System will be in
operation. which will list all of the
library's holdings and be cumulative
for all new acquisitions.

The Archives will use free
standing shelving made by Cor-
Craft. a division of the Corrections
Department at Attica Prison. The‘
library‘s shelving was made by
Republican Steel and Hollowell. a
Division of Standard Press Steel.l
The shelving made by Hollowall is
unconventional: it will be suspended
from the ceiling.

extensive collections in the nation

The New York State Library and
State Archives are moving their
collection of approximately ﬁve and
one half million items from the State '
Education Building on Washington
Avenue to the Cultural Educational
Center in the South Mall.

The move will cost nearly one and
a half million dollars and. according
to Principal LibrarianJ. Vanderveer
Judd, “is probably one of the largest
’of its kind in history.“

The transfer of the library's
collection began last Wednesday and
should be completed by April I. The
collection of the State Archives will
begin being moved in late March.

The Archives. a repository of
historically valuable state
government records. will as a result

. of the move be able to centralize it
holdings in one location. The
Archives were created in l97l and

MAGIC SHOW

"Magic Mushrooms“ have
become a legal. multi-million dollar
industry in the United States.

Rolling Stone magazine reports
that dozens of mail order ﬁrms are
selling psychedelic mushroom kits.
which include everything from
spores to special growing lamps,
thanks to a loophole in U.S. drug
laws.

It turns out that the mushrooms.
when grown. contain generous
quantities of the illegal psychedelic

become “magic mushrooms.“

One Florida mail order company

grow-your-own kits. and it's all
perfectly legal.

The group. calling itself the
“Kentucky Marijuana Feasibility
Study, Incorporated.” contends that
badly needed tax monies are being
wasted by the government's thumbs

The study‘s organizer. Gatewood
Galbraith. claims that by legalizing
and then taxing marijuana use, the
government could “collect badly
needed funds to ﬁnance better health
care and education services. and
provide new incomes of between
$3000 and $5000 to over one million
farmers in the United States.

Says Galbraith: “This country
cannot continue to afford to send
billions of dollars to Mexico and
South America when our own
farmers can earn that money.“
Galbraith adds that marijuana is
increasingly a political issue.
especially in Kentucky. where there
are more marijuana smokers than
rcgistcrcd Republicans.

identical to "the original“ wave. but .
with the peaks and valleys exactly
reversed. . ’

When the two waves met. the
professor says. they would cancel
each other out exactly and silence
would result.

Professor Ffowcs-Williams says
his device. once built. couldbe used
by residents along busy streets to
cancel out highway noises. He adds
that. with anti-sound, the Concorde
SST will cease to be a political issue,
because its sound around airports
can be mufﬁed completely.

SEXIST BOOK

Twenty-four scholars working to
take sexism out of the Bible have
accrued that God will still remain a
"he" in the Good Book.

According to William Holliday.
one of the scholars, the new Revised
Standard Version of the Bible will
really only eliminate what he calls
“secondary sexism."

l-loiliday says the reviewing panel
had decided that there would be no
“licr's” or "she's" when referring to
(iod because translators of the
rchigious work wanted to remain
liiitlit‘ul to the pronouns used in the
original Greek and Hebrew texts.

The decision by the panel
regarding God‘s sex reportedly has
disappointed ii sizcabic number of
Christians hoping to take sexism out
of the Bible altogether. One
moderator speaking at aNational
Council of Churches Forum
suggested that people can experience
scxisni more fully themselves by
praying to “Our Mother" instead ol
"Our Father."

DOOMED DUCK

A youth board in Finland has

ruled that Donald Duck is not
suitable reading material for
children.

the board in Helsinki has voted
unanimously to cancel all public
library subscriptions to the famous
comic books after a leftist group
argued tiiat Donald is unduly
bourgeois and that he presents a
pernicious attitude toward society.

Among the complaints against
Donald cited by the board are the
fact that the comic books commonly
fcriturc pictures of naked ducks and
that Donald seems to have a
common-an marriage with Daisy.
