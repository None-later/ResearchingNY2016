By RICHIE MERMELSTEIN
bout seven years ago. a
young man called up WNEW-
FM and told the disc jockey
that his girlfriend was going to
commit suicide. and requested

that he play something to persuade her
not to. The discjockey said a few words to
her on the air and then played her a song
by Joni Mitchell.
The story is brought up not to rave
about the fact that the girl is still alive but
to show the power ofthe little talking box
found in more than 95 per cent of the
houses in America. The caller solicited
the disc jockey's help on his ownnit

with a girl about to take her own life. he
opted not to call the police or the clergy.

Fornatale, who has logged more than
I |.000 hours with WNEW. has developed
an excellent presentation integrating his
personal anecdotes regarding radio with
his own observations as a life long media-
freak. And. though he has been one ofsix
regular disc jockeys on perhaps the most
widely acclaimed rock station in the
country for nine years. he presents his
views without sounding omniscient or
didactic. Nor does he speak from a
pedestal and rely on his fame as asourcc
for unquestioned knowledge and respect.

Oiled Rock Bed rock was the creation

After a few anecdotes on misspellings

Dan Ackroyd's satire on AM and FM

ﬁlms of the Beatles performing on The Ed
Sullivan Show and in Apple‘s studios.
and closed with a montage compiled by
the director who pieced together the
American Time Capsules for the old
Smothers Brothers show. lnterspersed
were comments about the media. and
his views on the media as the massage.

“How many of you." Fornatale asked,
“have ever seen. on one stage. at the same
time. the four persons who comprised the
singing group known as The Beatles?"
Three people raised their hands.

He pointed out. from this. how even
though less than one per cent of the
audience had actual semi-personal
contact with the group, they had
managed to affect our lives so
dramatically. Their means: obviously.the
media.

The show, which wasthe brainstorm of
Fornatale and fellow mediaologiat Don
Thiergard, was followed by an extensive
question and answer session, wherein
Fornatale—unlike almost every SUNYA
speaker since Jimmy Breslin two'yeara
ago—opened the floor to questions on all
subjects, not necessarily pertaining to his
pet topic.

The open-mindedness and lack of
pomposity FornataIc displayed helped
the lengthy presentation breeze by. It
seems little surprise, upon reﬂection. that
a would-be suicide turned not to the
clergy. or the police. but to the fellow who
spends his time talking and playing
records on the little box each day.
