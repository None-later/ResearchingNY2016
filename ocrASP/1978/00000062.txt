Favors Ali In Fight

LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) Fight
impresario Don King, insisting that
his breath does not reek from sour
grapes, warned today that sending
Leon Spinks against Muhammad
Ali is like feeding is Christian to the
lions.

“l um not worried about what‘s
going to happen to the kid physically
-— it‘s the damage that may be done
to him mentally,"said the promoter,
arriving for Wednesday‘s
heavyweight championship bout at
the Hilton Pavilion here.

“It could break his spirit. Might
destroy his career. Lunk Wltltt hustc
and greed did to Duun llobick."

Bobick, it heavyweight “Whitc
Hope," came out of thc I972
Olympics with lofty promise and
joined Joe Frazicr‘s stable in
Philadelphia. Last May hc was sent
against it veteran Kcn Norton and
was knocked out in the first round.
Rcccntly he was knyncd in
Johannesburg by it little known
South African. Kullic Knuctzc.

“All of us now are very concerned
about what might be the future of
Ilohick.“ said King. "He had

tremendous promise but his
handlers, offered a bigpurse, shoved
him into a match over his head.“

“I have the greatest respect for
Spinks. He has marvelous physical
assets. He is strong. aggressive with
great potential. Normally he should
be champion some day. But he is not
rcttdy for this one. What is it bad
boating now going to do for him?"

“And. make no mistake, he can
expect it beating. i don‘t can: how
old Ali is, how much overwcight or
how burcd he seems. He's slillttgrcut
fighter maybe the greatest ever
and he‘s got it home pride. He's not
going to soft pedal with his title ill
