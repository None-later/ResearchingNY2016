Council Gets Eraluation Copy

by Steve Brackett

A copy ofthc evaluation ofSocial
and Behavioral Sciences Dean
Richiird Kendall has been released
to members of that college‘s faculty
council by Vice President for
Academic Affairs David Martin.

College Faculty Council member
Wayne lleiser said Martin released
the copy as a restilt of presstirc frotn
council members at a meeting earlier
this week. at which objections were
raised abotit Martin‘s decision to
restrict distribution of the report to
a single copy.

In a Feb. 4 memorandum to the
chairs of the committees and
councils participating in the
evaluation of four SUNYA Deans.
Martin said that only one copy of
each evaluation would be made "to
insure that there is as iiiticli
confidentiality as possible."

Martin has had the only copy of
the Kendall evaluation. Council
members agreed with Martin on the
need for stressing confidentiality.
council Chair and Department of
African arid Afro-American studies
factilty member Frank l’ogue said.
"but we dcrnantled another copy for
our group."

A source close to the committee
sttid Martin was hesitant abotit
releasing another copy. llte

disagreement between Martin and

council members arose because of

Martin's decision to hold on to the
only copy of the evaluation. The
disagreement did not arise over
keeping the report confidential. the
source said.

"Martin's memo differed from our
original agreement about
procedure." he said. “but he didn't
think so."

Martin denied that there was
disagreement between himself and
council members over the issue of
restricting copies. His memo on
confidentiality did not change their
original agreement on procedure. he
sairl.

 

erything has been resolved."
Martin taid. >

Heise'. said that while making
another copy of the evaluation was
discussed at the meeting with
Martin. nothing was actually
demanded by the council. He added
that Martin initially hesitated to
make a second copy. but eventually
agreed to do so.

Heiset' said the process of the
evaluation has been secretive
because “we are dealing with
sensitive material. Dean Kendall‘s
privacy and reputationarc at stake."

l’ogue said that he would
probably get his first look at the

Survey Reveals High

liy Mike I’carlniun

A survey conducted on all five
quads last Monday and l'ttcsday
indicated that approximately 50 per
cent of the SUNYA stttdciit body ltas
had the flu virus.

Accordiitg to Director of Health
Services Dr. Janet flood. the hiin
incidence of the virus among
SUNYA students will not cause the
cancellation of classes. “We would
expect on the basis of how many
people haVc already recovered that it
[the outbreak] has crested."she said.
"I am not recommending that classes
be cancelled." llood said that there
was never any basis to the rttniors
spreading around campus that
classes might be eattcclled because of
the virus.

According to Hood. tlte

 

incubation period ofthc virus is very
short and after two or three days
most of the symptoms begin to
sttbsidc. "By the time everybody
finds out what‘s hit them. it begins to
sintmcr down." she said. Hood said
that the number of students at the
infirmary has reached normal levels
again arid that only one half of the
beds in the infirinary are currently
being used.

“there has been no officical
statement from the State Health
Department as to what type of flu it

SA May Stop Funding Club ﬂips

by Steve ()ster

SA plans to stop funding the trips
taken by campus cltibs and
organirations as part of a change iii
the philosophy of its Budget
Committee. according to committee
chair .loliti Sharkcy.

Sharkcy said rising costs and
inflation. as well as adesire to place
a higher priority on those etctitsand
organirations which "benefit the
entire siudertt body rather than small
groups of spectal interests" were the
principal reasons for the committee:
change in postttre.

"We‘re faced with having to work
with ivliitt we‘ve got. which isn't
enough. and at the same tiriic try to
make the money go as far as we can
for all of ottr students." Shiirkcy
said.

The SA budget is funded try the
$66 tax piiid by all full-time
SUNYA students caclt academic
year. Of that amount. according to
Sliarkey. $|4.50 goes to the Atltlctic
Department to ltelp finance varsity
sports. and $2 iii allotted to

NYl’lRO. The remaining taxes
combine to leave the Budget
Committee With just over 3400.000
to allocate among various campus
clubs and organizations.

Faced with increased costs. due in
part to new projects like the Record
Co-op and the head shop. SA will be
titiable to meet all of the requests for
funds this semester. A raise in taxes
can come about through a
referendum. but. according to
Sliarkcy. won‘t help to meet
present costs. "Although in all
probability the tax raise wrll be pttt
to a vote this spring. for the etirretit
semester we'll be forced to work
within the present budget." he said.

New York State law limits the
stttdciit tax to a maximum of $70.
ititd SU NYA's $66 figure represents.
along with SUNY at Buffalo. the
lowest tax in the State University
system.

Sharkey said he hopes the
members of the next Bridget
Committee will be representative of
the entire campus community. Last

year‘s committee. according to SA
President Dave Gold. was “a group
of white ntales. not a truly
representative body."

“We've got quite a diverse group
of people." said Sltarkey. “including
members of the Feminist Alliance.
International Student Association.
EOP. Fucrza Latina. and AMIA."
