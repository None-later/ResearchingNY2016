The report of an ad-hoc
committee on dormitory fire safety.
has recommended stricter
enforcement of fire safety rules and
the purchase of additional f'trc
equipment. according to Vice
President for Finance and Business
John Hartigan.

Problem

The report. released recently by
SUNYA Department of Public
Safety Assistant Director Karl W.
Scharl, enumerates what is being
done and what will be done in the
future to' insure dormitory fire
safety. Hartigan said the new

measures go bayond New York State
standards. .

The inside of all suite doors will be
labeled with vinyl selfoticking exit
signs, and additional fire
extinguishers will be purchased.
according to the report.
Combustible gas indicators will also
be installed in dormitories. These
purchases are to be made within the
coming year.

Hartigan said the new metisures
will entail no additional costs to
students since they will come out of
the current operating budget.

Hartigan criticized the report
because it didn't propose ways for

Comic Strip Causes Controversy

ruiilimietl from page three

Editor Jon Hodges said he had
doubts beforehand about running
the strip. but decided against
intcrupting the continuity of the
weekly feature after a discussion
with the then Editor-in-Chief
Spence Raggio.

Hodges did edit out the last ttatne
of one of the individuals referred to
in the strip. but left in another
because it was not as similar in
spelling and appearance to the names
ofthe actual students. A third name
was not recognized.

Hodges said he was more
concerned that individuals might be
lturt than large groups of people. and
that he“helievcd in theautonom) of
the comic strip.“

“I he artist knows what the
problems are. and he will be there
sensitive in the future." Hodges said.
He said also he has requested that he
he provided with a backlog of several
episotlcs,“so that if we are handed a
questionable one. we can hold it and
run one ol the hacklogged strips,"

Martello, in a letter to SA Vice
President Kathty liaron. a member
oi the grottp that met in his oll'tce.

conceded that the ASI’ may have
used “poor judgement“ in printing
the strip. but he said he couldn‘t
print a promise to prevent a
recurrence.

“Printing such a statement would
be tantamount to promising neverto
make a mistake again. which
obviously is not possible." Martello
wrote.

In his letter Martello also said he
plans to write to the leaders of all
campus minority groups to “inform
them that we are a very open
organization and that we welcome
participation from every segment of
the student populus.“

He refused in the letter to accede
to the demands of the group that an
editorial review board composed of
minority members he established to
advise the ASP of potentially
offensive or biased articles and
columns.

“llavingurttclcs and columns read
and possibly censored prior to
publication is essentially
restraint.‘ and not cotnpatiblc With a
free press." he said.

He also refused to discontinue the
cotnie strip. An editor's note beneath

to Hartigan. the‘purchsse of our
additional criuipmc «Would be?
unnecessary if vandalism and
destruction of present fire safety
equipment 'could be substantially
reduced. . ~
Memorandum Proposal

in a memorandum to Hartigan.
Acting President Vincent O'Leary
suggested making the Campus
Safety Committee a part of the
University Community Council.‘
O‘Leary will ask the Council to
address the problem of vandalism,
and propose new ways to enforce
existing fire safety mics.

the letter in today‘s edition. however.
disclaims any association between
the opinions expressed in the strip
and those of the ASP's editorial
staff.

The person who wrote the
controversial strip said he did it “asa
spoof on a mythological creature
called a JAI’. l was making fun ofthc
stereotype. not encouraging it...l
tried to exaggerate to the point
where the woman would seem so
ridiculous that nobody would be
offended. that people would see that
the stereotype was ridiculous.
Unfortunately. it didn't work that
way."

He said he has begun to feel
"insignificant" in this whole affair.
The coalition “is using my cartoon as
a weapon against the ASI’ as a sort
of rallying point,“ ltc said.

Ward said the ASP "must take
responsibility for printing the strip;
it never should have been printed."
