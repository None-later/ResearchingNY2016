SHORT NOTICE
' The latest shot to be fired in the
continuing battle over Randy
Newman's song. “Short People."
comes in the form of a new record
with the not-so-original title. “Tall
People.”

This parodyon Newman's hit tune
has been released on the “Miggit”
label by two singers. Wee Willie
Small and Tiny Stump. In reality,
Small and Stump are pseudonyms
for two well-know. less-than-tall
people, night-club singer Steve
Lawrence and TV comedian Tim
Conway.

Here‘s a sampling of the lyrics
from “Tall Peoplez"

“They got giant ears and billboard
faces. elephant teeth with great big
spaces; bocky stick legs without any
hair; they got skinny little butts
hanging in the air . . . "

'I'hc chorus continues: “Don‘t
want no tall people. no basketball
people. lturray for short people
down here."

Lawrence says that he and
('onway wrote the entire song “in
about eight minutes."

SUPER VIDEO

Stereo television may be less than‘

two years away.

The American Telephone and
Telegraph Comapny is installing
special audio equipment in more
than 600 US television stations to
improve their sound quality and to
give the stations stereo capability.

The new process is called
“diploxmg.” What it docs is to
"piggyback" a higher quality audio
signal onto the \‘idco signal wltich
[\l & l transmits to IV stations.
lhc new method will replace the
present system ol parcllel telephone
lines that are used to transmit

programs from the networks to
member stations. ' .

Several TV set manufacturers are
said to be studying the new system
with an eye toward marketing stereo
TV sets in the near future.

DEADLY STUFF

The World Health Organization is
warning that pesticides and
herbicides have emerged as one of
the major human health problems
on the earth today.

A recent World Health study
concluded that at least hallo million
pesticide poisonings are Occuring
each year. with the rates in third
world nations reported, to be
“alarmineg high.“

According to the Christian
Science Monitor. chemical
companies in the industrial nations
are now churning out an incredible 4
billion pounds of insect. rat. and
weed killer each year. a quantity
which amounts to more than a
pound of the stuff for every person
on earth.

The Monitor reports that many
pesticides. including DD’I'. are being
sprayed in third world nations in
quantities 30 to 40times hcavicrlhttn
was originally recommended
because many insects have
developed resistance to the poisons.

the United Nations recently
catalogued more than 300 species of
insects and mites which can now
resist chemicals that once killed
them. One result. according to the
UN. has been a sharp resurgence in
malaria. a disease transmitted by
mosquitoes.

The Monitor also reports that
American chemical companies In
I975 alone exported more than 77
million pounds of deadly pesticides
that had not been cleared for use
inside the United States. According
to the newspaper. some pesticides
being sold abroad by American
firms had been banned as long as five
years ago by the Environmental
Protection Agency. Buyers of the
pesticides were not aware ot‘the ban.
however.

One ﬁnal irony to this situation is
that food products American
purchases from abroad are now
arriving here with our own poisons
in them. Meat and poultry samples
have been found to contain excessive
levels of banned pesticides. and
traces of the deadly chemicals are
just being found in numerous brands
of coffee.

SALTY DOG

A Tufts University Professor of
Medicine says that millions of
American children are headed for
high blood pressure problems
because their parents are turning
them into salt junkies.

Doctor Lot Page says that many
children already haVe elevated blood
pressure by the age of two. because
they are overfed salt during infancy.
The doctor says the average
American should consume no more
than two grams of salt a day. or
about three-quarters of a spoonful.
Most of us. he adds. eat at least five
times that amount.

Doctor Lot claims that the taste
for salt is as addictive as smoking.

FOOLED AGAIN

Actor abd radio personality
Orson Wells crested‘ panic in the
United States 40 years ago when be
broadcast a make-believe martian
invasion of the earth in a radio show
he called “War of the Worlds.”

That same kind of panic occurred
in the Netherlands last month. A
Dutch radio station, in a regularly-
featured early-morning show titled
“The Death Escapade," informed its
listeners that the world was ending.

The .|:00 am. to 4:00 am.
program announced that “The
Purgatory" was at hand, and that
there was only one place on earth
where humans could find peace and
salvation. Listeners were told the
only safe refuge was a small island in
a bay southeast ofAmsterdam called
Woudricbcm.

According to the Swedish
newspaper Dagens Nyhether. at
least 3000 scared listeners hit the
island in the middle of the night,
many of them rowing what the
newspapers called the “strangest
boats." No one living on the island
was amused.

PSYCHIC WARS

A consultant for the Stanford
Research Institute in California has
reportedly concluded thata“psychic
civil war" is likely to break out in the
United States sometime in our
future.

The Zetetic. a scientific magazine
which attempts to debunk such
theories, says that the prediction has
been issued by an SRI “futurologist”
named Duane Elgin.

Elgin is said to have concluded
that the greatest danger facing
American society is a clash between
“transformentalists." described as

preservation of the. status . .

According to the Elgin forecast.
the “materialists” will have lasers
and stomie bombs at their disposal.
but the “transies” will have ESP and
psychic powers capable of disabling
electronic weapons at a distance.

The Zetetic magazine says Blur
has not predicted who would win
such a war. '

Elgin is out of town and could not
immediately be reached for
comment.

INSTANT RECALL

Women's groups in the Denver
area are attempting to organize a
campaign to recall a judge who
recently ruled that an alleged sexual
attack against a woman seemed to
him more like simple “seduction.”

The target of the recall effort is
District Court Judge Dean Mabry of
Trinidad. Colorado. ' i

Last month. Judge Mabry
dismissed second-degree sexual
assault charges against a 20-yarn0|d
man who. according to court
testimony. broke into a woman‘s
home, pushed her against a wall.
forced her to the floor. kissed her.
broke the zipper on her pants and
placed his hand inside.

Judge Mabry. in dismissing the
charges. suggested that the
defendant was. in thejudge‘s words.
“feeling out" the woman. Said the
judge: "This is more like an
attempted seduction than it is sexual
assault. albeit a little bit rough.”
Recalling his own personal
experiences. the Judge added: “That
is the way I remember it. It has been
quite a while."

The Denver chapter of the
National Organization for Women
reports it is considering organizing
a recall campaign like the one which
resulted in the ouster of a Madison,
Wisconsin. Judge last year.
