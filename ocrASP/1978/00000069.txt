Bucephalus!

The Lone Ranger had Silver. and Roy
Rogers had Trigger. The Roman emperor
Caligula kept his horse lncitatus (Swift)
in a stable of marble and. as we have
recently seen on television. appointed him
a member of the Senate. Alexander the
Great. too. had his favorite horse. named
Bucephalus (in the Latinizcd spelling) or
Boukephaloslin the Greek spelling). This
would he a rather strange name for a
horse. as it means "oxhcad." but is
attributed to certain odd markings on the
horse's forehead.

Alexander acquired this horse when he
was a boy [2 years old. The horse was
brought to the court ofAIexandcr‘s father
Philip ll at Pclla by a Thessalian dealer.
(Thessaly was known throughout
antiquity for breeding line horses.) The
dealer asked the incredibly high price of
thirteen talents, but Philip was willing to
consider. He. some of his ofﬁcers, and
Alexander went to have a look. But the
horse was nervous and unmanageable.
rearing as soon as anyone attempted to
mount him. Alexander asked his father to
let him try. and Philip agreed although he
did not expect the boy to succeed.
Alexander had noticed that the horse was
frightened by shadows; so he turned his
face toward the sun. gently stroked him.
and finally mounted and rode him. fully
in command. Philip not only allowed
Alexander to keep the horse hut told him.
“Son. you must find a kingdom for
yourself; Macedonia is not large enough

to hold you.“

Two Novels Four Million Miles Apart

By MARK J. McGARRY

Usually. i try to relate the hooks

presented iii any oitc column. You Will
itc\ct see it more tenuous relationship
than this: lltcsc l\\'tl books are both
science lictiott novels by \tt'ttei's not
tisttally associated \tith the science fiction
ltcld. Other than that. thc_\ couldn't be
tiiotc dillcrcnt.

lln' Space lmnpirm by Colin Wilson
(Pocket. M75) sounds like it trashy
space-opera. and for the most part.
tlllltil'llllltllcl). it is gust that, lltc
copyright date is |‘)7(t. btit it reads as tl
Ml. Wilson has read ito sctcitcc lictiott
or scientific literature since the turit oi
the century. llis ignorances and errors are
astounding attd they hate not escaped
the notice aitd derision oi tltc public.
Damon Kitigltt edits a series of
anthologies attd iii a special feature here
cites a few of Wilson‘s tnanitics. sotitc of
which are:

“  Meteor showers are always
associaled Willi corners. and there wasn't
a come! within for/y million miles." (p.
28)

A phrase like "four ntillion miles per
day" in regards to space travel has been
obsolete for centuries. Wilson cannot

Uistinguish between acceleration and

speed. Meteor showers appear as
"showers" only when they L‘lllcl‘ an
atomosphcrc. and they are not always
associated with comets. in fact. there is
one shower associated with one comet;
the relationship between the two
phenomena remains conjectural. There
are 220 pages iii the hook. and Knight
didn‘t begin to fish all the inaccuracies out
of the first 28 pages.

All that aside. is the story any good?
liriclly, liartlt spaceships discover a
mammoth alien vessel out in the asteroid
belt. There are several humanoid
creatures on board. either (lead or in a
state of suspended anintatiott. They are
brought back to Earth. ()ne escapes. the
other is destroyed. The one that has
escaped is apparently able to drain the
life—energies of humans. and/or
appropriate their bodies. Eventually.
more of them appear. The trick is getting
rid of them. Once Wilson gets back to
Earth. the story is, if pedestrian, well-
told. There is a fascinating theory that
humans siphon off life-energy from one
another during sexual contact. but not an
awful lot is done with it.

Colin Wilson is a famous critic. I am
given to understand. Maybe this exempts
him from editing. It shouldn‘t have.
Much of The Space Vampires is firmly
grounded in ignorance; the rest of the
book is well-written. as to the language
itself. but other than that there is not

much that can be said for it.

'Ilic Shining by Stephen King(Signct.
$2.50) is quite attothcr matter. The book
should be on the best-seller lists by the
ti me you read this. and with good reason:
it is one of the finest books I have ever

be

read. Though it is not marketed as science
fiction (still the kiss of death. I fear) it
concerns Danny, a small boy who is a
telepath. His parents are ordinary people
with their sltare of problems. The
husband had been a teacher at a private
school when his provoked assualt on a
student caused him to be fired. A friend
helps him find a job as caretaker of
Colorado's Overlook Hotel during the
winter season. when the hotel is closed.

At the hotel. the family meets
Hallorann. the hotel's Black cook. He.
too. has a telepathic gift. though it is not
as strong as Danny‘s. He calls it “the
shining." and cautions Danny that there
is an aura of evil around the hotel that is
no less real because it is mental rather
than physical.

Showed in. the family is vulnerable.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

The hotel exudes a malignant personality
that everyone can feel. It is murderous.
and it chooses to act through Jack
Torrance. Danny‘s father. Eventually it
possesses him. and he becomes the spirit
of the hotel, incarnate.

ks

It is a long book (447 pages). but it is
gripping. t read it in one long sitting, and
wanted more at the end. All of his
characters. including that ofthe hotel. are
plausible. consistent. and convincing.
The accelerating process of the erosion of
Jack's personality by the hotel is well-
drawn and frightening.

It has been said that in order to be a
best-seller in these times. a book need
only be long, concerned with the occult.
slightly gory and have pretensions of
literary concerns. It might be easy for the
reader to lose this book in the morass of
similar-appearing books on the-
newsstands. That would be a mistake.
The Shining has something more to it.
and represents something which is. -I
think. an oddity: the best-seller that
actually has some substance that makes it
worthy of that status. J
