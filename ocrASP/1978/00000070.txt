ii any given Friday night. as
the Alumni Quad crowd
returns from its nightly
pilgrimage to O‘Heaney‘s
Tavern, that haven for Pabst
beer and “Mac the Knife“ cnthusiaists, a
weak shout normally beginsto swell from
Alden Hall, with seven or eight drunken
voices crying, "Pierce sucks.“

The cry is soon strengthened as others
join in in from Waterbury and Saylcs
(Brubacher remains dead to the world)
until what was once a lonely sound in the
night has crescendoed to a deafening cry
ol"‘PIERCE SUCKS!“

Perhaps many of those who have
participated in this weekend ritual might
be horrified to learn that they have
iniidvcrently been verbally attacking a
day care center. (iiven the condition
they're normally in. perhaps they
wouldn‘t. But it is important to r'ali/e
that there is more to l’ierce Hall than it

takes care of as many as 60 children
during the course of a given week. the
children are broken into two age
brackets; l8 montlts to three )ctit‘s old
and three to five years old.

Under a pilot program that began this
year. the center offers an alternative
kindergarden program in the morning
which is taught by a certiﬁed teaelier. lit
