The Nielsen Pearson Band
By PAUL HENEGHAN
he Nielseti Pearson Band ltas
got problems. Someltow they
walked itito the Wally Heider
Studios in San Francisco and
cante ottt with an albttm tltat
sounds straight out of Philadelphia

Mark Pearson. who wrote tlte majority
of cuts. has tltc idea tltat the Nielsen
Pearson Band should be Htill aitd Oates.
while Reed Nielsen‘s voice bears a strong
resemblance to Dash Crofts.

Take side one of this albttm and throw
it out. All five cuts sound like watered
down “all and Oates at best. arid at
worst. well . . . I won‘t go itito that.

Side two is a little different. Pearson
opens the first track. "I Need a Song,“
with a tasteful piano intro reminiscent ol
Billy Joel. However. the soiigdegetiet'ates
ittto tltc sante old Hall and Dates
imitation. Pearson tsii't kiddittg \yliett he
says he needs it song.

llte secotid track. "Once in Line." is by
far the best songon the album. Penned by
Nielsen. this one sounds like it actually
came frotn California. It finishes with an
excellent guitar solo fade-out that's a
dead ringer for some of the liaglcs‘ earlier
work.

All iii all though. this album goes
nowhere. Evert thouglt both Nielson and
Pearson possess I'inc voices. their
weaknesses (dull lyrics. bad timing, arid
the same heat throughout the album)
overpower their strengths Yet with a new
producer. stronger material arid sonte
practice. the Nielsen Pearson liand could
possible still tttakc it real contribution to
the soft rock/pop genre.

Mary Travers
By PETER HOFFMAN

evaded Mary Travers in the
seven years since the breakup
of Peter. Paul and Mary, on
of the most successful pop-
folk groups in history, In the ﬁrst four
years as a soloist, Travers recorded four

 

 

 

acquired a new label, new produeer, and a
group of excellent songs. Unfortunately,
none of this helps. The album is awful. A
good deal of the blame must be put upon
the producer, Vini Poncia. Poncia is a
protege of Richard Perry. the worst
record producer around. All of Perry‘s
numerous bad production habits have
become part of Poncia‘s repertoire. The
worst of these is the emphasis on
arrangements and the absolute disregard
for the artist.

All of the arrangements are so stiflingly
slow that a few of the songs sound better
when the speed is turttcd up to 45 rpm.
This is especially the case oti the Hollies
classic. “The Air That 1 Breathe“ and oti
Dand Fogclberg‘s "Part of the Plan,“ l
don‘t think Fogelberg ever meant for the
song to be song as it torch ballad.

There is an absolutely disastrous
rendering of Nils l.ofgrcn‘s "Home is
Where the H ttrt ls“ and if it isn‘t ludicrous
enough that l'ravcrs‘ would even attempt
to sing a l.olgren song. one should listcit
to the arrangement. lt is a tragically
unsuccessful attempt at reggae.

lrttvcrs' deserves so nittcli more than
this. Her "Circle Song" of a few years ago
is a classic as are all of licrcndcavors with
Peter and Pattl. ()ne hopes that the

Sweet
By Al. BACA
wcet‘s new album.
Ill'tltll‘tl, sltows tltttt they ltave
cotiic a long way since the
I975 release of their last
American album. Desolation
Boulevard. l hey have progressed botlt as
producers and as musicians. giving tip
their old style of basic teeny-hopper. ass-
kieking rock and roll for a more serious
endeavor into clevci' arrangements that
still possess a good rock beat,
the group still consists ol Andy Scott
on guitar. Mick 'l ticker on drums. Stcye
Priest oti bass, aitd Brian L‘onolly singtttg
lead vocals. l‘or this album, Sweet has
brought iti (ieoff Westley on keyboards,
Ronnie Aspt'cy on brass instruments. and
Richard Harvey on wiitd instruments. It
is this array of diversified musicians
which give Level [leaded its appeal.
The music on the album is, indeed. very
good. The only problem is that the lyrics
have much to be desired. A six-year-old
child could have written lyrics as good as
those which are found in sortie of these
songs. On “Love is Like Oxygen.“ We
have lyrics such as "Love is like oxygen.
you get too much, you gel too high, not
enough and you're gunmr die, love gets
you high."

“Silverbirdf‘..,on the other hand, is the
one cat which is best exemplary of the
group’s‘progress as musicians. It is a good
rocker with' intelligent lyrics and slick
production. The song contains fine drum
solos, along with equally good solos on
guitar, bass, andsynthesizer. Connolly‘s
vocals provide a definite asset to the
group, for he possesses a unique voice
which was not fully utilized nor
developed at the time of Desolation
Boulevard.
