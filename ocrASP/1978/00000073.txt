Would you let your child join a student
union? Dear members of the faculty.
administrators (and bureaucrats). I asked you
here to discuss an extremely pressing problem
that is spreading like a cancerous agent on our
college campus. Our problem is student
unions and the growing student power here at
Albany State.

Somewhere. somehow these college
students got this crazy notion of a union—a
union of students. Ladies and Gentlemen. we
all know that these students are our
responsibility. We must not let them get
“taken” by some “unionization salesman.“
who dcceives our students. We are talking
about children—«l8 year olds. 19 year olds. 20
year olds. and Zl year olds. The idea of a
student union is ludicrous! in my day. we
didn't have any unions; we had a student
government and that was sufﬁcient. In fact. I
was president of my 0.0.. and we provided
many important functions. like sock hops and
dances. Hopefully, when they graduate. then
they will be responsible adults. But. as ol'now.
we must protect these naive children! We must
protect them from tyranny! Communism!
And what not!

lscc no positive reason for a student union.
In our student government. there is an elite
few who do represent the students. Strident
Association works hand-in-hand with the
administration. The most important part is
that we can control SA! We can even destroy
SAl When students asked for more power, we
' even let a few studentsjoin our faculty Senate.

These union movement members want
more input into their ed ucation. Ihcy say that
r they know the problems. They say that we are
unresponsive to their educational needs. They
say that they have different interests than \vu.
This is liogwasli! l have bccnan administrator
, for 20 years. I know the problems. I have
Ph.D‘s in seven different fields. I know the
problems. i have children and grandchildren. l
robicms. I know the problems!

Joining a What?!

Some people might say that maybe they can
help solve some issues. What have they done?
These hippies complain about the . poor
women's health facilities. They ask for more
gynecologists. more birth control
information. cheaper costs. But. what will this
solve? The answer to this problem. fellow
faculty members. is not in a more
comprehensive health clinic. The answer is in
ABSTINENCE! We shouldn't have a
women‘s health clinic at all; it would only
encourage the behavior we abhor. Isn't it our
duty to restore the moral values to the youth in
our society?

  

input into decisions of tenure. They think that
they could judge our peers better than we can.
Can you imagine what the faculty of this
university would be like if they decided tenure?
We all know that not one of us would be
working here. Such anti-Americans like
Ralph Nader and Lillian Hellman would be
amongst the faculty or even worse than that.
they would have teachers who constantly
criticize the administrators and university
system! We must not let these communist
revolutionaries take overl

We must be careful. We are dealing with a

    
    

Ah, to Be a Car in

by Jon Lafayette

When a shiny new car rolls off the assembly
line in Detroit (or Japan. Germany. etc.) it is
ready to take to the road and give thousands of
miles of good performance for its grcatful
owner. One of the worst things that can
happen to it is being shipped offto Ncw York
and become the proud possession of a student
in Albany.

The only thing that could be worse might be
for an old car to be sent to Albany to ferry a
student in his pursuit of knowledge. This is
usually the case.

Students are notorious for running their
cars into the ground. They neglect to put gas in
the car every so often. so you can imagine how
often they add little things like oil.
transmission fluid. or water to their poor.
thirsting vehicle. The neglected creature must
blink its warning lights sometimes for days
crying "oil. please. i need oil.“

Funny noises are ignored. Shimmics.
wooble. rumbles. and shakes are overlooked
so long as the valiant engine turns over and

drags the car. no matter how wounded. to its
appointed destination.

it knows that if it doesn‘t start it is likely to
stay in whatever spot it stopped in for very
long time. For the want old good connection
on a starter wire. a good 01' Ford sat in the
State Quad lot for three months including
Christmas vacation.

Even worse than any torture imaginable by
the student driver is the dillcmma presented by
the prospect of snow. When a foot of snow
falls. as you may have noticed. a good portion
of your average car may be covered by drifts.
Indeed many a small foreign car has been
buried under a moderate sized drift.

in addition to what may naturally fall onthe
car that is left mercilessly exposed to the
elements. Albanian snowplows assure that
hard, packed snow surround the wheel ofthe
helpless auto.

If the driver does not have the good
judgement to extricate his faithful servant
from the snow early. both the car and master
will have a difficult time of it later as snow

They found out about our  y ' ‘

accumulates.

Those eariybirds have noticed a problem.
though: when: do you put a our newly
extricated from a growing snowbank'l
Certainly lfhck in another snowbank.

The way snow is cleared here in Albany. the
ﬁrst priority is given to the clearance of the
roads. This means that snow is pushed into
where cars used to park. This means cars begin
to park where they used to drive. This changes
a mighty thoroughfare like Western Avenue
into a two-way but one-lane road.

This is remedied by the city by ordering all
parked cars out of the area while plows.
shovels, and dump trucks cart away loads of
snow.

Those who don‘t move theircars voluntarily
may very well return to where they left their
car and ﬁnd a nice clear space.

I asked the tow truck driver were he put cars
left in snow removal areas. He said that he
really didn't care. hejust found an empty spot
and dumped the car there.

Ah. to be a car in Albany.
