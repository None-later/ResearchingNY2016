College 90-7] on Tuesday night at
University Gym, to stretch their
winning record to a 12-2 mark. it
was their third straight victory.

Ron Knox, starting. his second
game in a row, began the scoring for
the jayvees with a foul-line jump‘e‘ru

He teamed up with 6‘5” center Jim

Bittker. to pace the Pups to an early

19-8 margin. Bittker was tenacious

off the boards in this span of time,
' pulling in ﬁve rebounds in the first
two minutes of play.

But something which has plagued
the Pups over this season popped up
again. After getting off to a
sensational start, where they looked
like they would blow Junior College
off the court, they started to let up.

They held a 23-12 lead with 12
minutes remaining in the half. But
for the next eight minutes. all the
Pups could manage was two ﬁeld
goals and two free throws. Junior
College wasn‘t much better. yet they
were able to close the gap to six. 29-
23.

"We did relax a little." said
Albany coach Bob Lewis. “In JV
competition it‘s tough to be intense
at all points."

- with Albany 'o’uts'coring 1 Junior
' College 17-13. Bittker, Knox, and

Steve Low were the main guns in this
surge. which gave the Pups a 46-36
half-time advantage.

in the second half, the Pups were
as erratic as ever. They started out
looking like they were ready to let
the game slip out of their hands. The
visitors scored six unanswered
points. and eight of the first 10 in the
half, to close within three. 48-45.

At this point, Albany received a
big break. The Junior College
center, .lack Hayes, had to sit down
when he committed his fourth foul in
the game. Albany was then able to
open up their offense and get back in
control.

Successive buckets by Knox. Don
Juron. and Lee Gardner opened the
gap to nine. and by the time Hayes
rejoined the action. the lead had
blossomed to 15, at 64-49.

“Good shooting was our only
strong point in the game.“ claimed
Lewis. The jayvees hit 30 of 50 shots
from the field for a 60 percent
shooting percentage.

Despite the strong shooting. the
Pups still had difficulty maintaining
the lead. Junior College closed
within nine, and they were on the
move. But with almost seven
minutes to play, Junior College went
over the foul limit.

Sparky

BUFFALO (AP) Sparky Lyle. the
1977 American League Cy Young
Award winner, has reluctantly
resigned himself to spending another
season with the world champion
New York Yankees. ‘

The left-handed relief star was
upset over the Yankees” off-season
acquisition of free agent relievers
Rich Gossage and Rawly Eastwick.
and recently asked to be traded.
However. Yankees‘ owner George
Steinbrenner has said Lyle won‘t be
traded. and Lyle doesn‘t expect him
to change his mind.

“i asked to be traded. but there
isn‘t much I can do since the team
said it isn't going to trade me. I‘m
under contract to the Yankees. so
l‘m locked in." said Lyle, in Buffalo
for an awards banquet.

“The club was trying to strengthen
themselves, and I don‘t blame them
for that; that‘s part of baseball. But 1
want to be sure that I can get enough
work in to be effective.

said.

He added that he‘s also certain
that neither Gossage nor Eastwick
will be traded before the season
starts.

“Why the hell would they pay
them all that money if they were
going to go out and trade them?“ he
asked.

Lyle said the fact that he and
catcher Thurman Munson both
want to be traded won't affect their
performance for the Yankees.

“What happens in the clubhouse
or offthe field is irrelevant. You still
have ajob to do on the field, and you

He said controversial Yankees
manager Billy Martin “is the only
man for the job here.

“I don't think anyone else could
manage this team. People ridicule
his managing. but I don‘t think any
of the people who ridicule him could
do a better job.

“He manages the same way he
played; a lot of hustle. takes a lot of
chances, does things the way he
wants. He‘s the only guy who could
have taken that club last season and
made a winner out of it," Lyle said.

Lyle also said that Oakland A‘s

pitcher Vida blue is "getting
screwed."
“i don‘t know whether the

 4 Thought It Could Happen

bout with the draft board loomed
large. Norton beat him, breaking
Ali's jaw. they say. in the ﬁrst round
of a non-championship ﬁght.
Somehow those defeats were never
counted. never tallied up in the Won-
loss column that summarizes every
ﬁghter’s career.

All was a winner par excellence,
elevating victory to a plane
unsurpassed in the short history of
American sport. He did not merely
outﬁght his opponents, his long
reach and quickness of movement
neutralizing their strength and
determination, be destroyed their
psyche. robbed them of their pride.
Winner take all.

The firstjudgc scored the fight 143
to 142. Ali.

When Ali‘s stamina was on the
wane. in the Shavers fight, in the
controversial victory over Young, in
tact anytime he had stepped in the
ring of late. Muhammad displayed a
remarkable ability of sapping his
opponent‘s energy. Like a sponge he
would soak in punch after ptinch. the
whole rationale of the rope-a-dope.

I'It)\V rapidly, when his speed
deserted him. did Ali become the
master ol’thc cover up. Choosing his
openings with care. All would give a
the challenger enough rope to hang
himself and then having done so
would lighten the noose.

Against Spinks the rope was
lraycd and the noose ti large one. hiit
the commentators had told its that to
beat the champ a lighter had to do
morc than outpoint him.

lhc secondjudgc gave the fight to
Spinks.

Spinks' corner was elated at the
light's end. his brother racing into

victory. Our faith in Ali was
unslutkcn. Other figltters had been
certain of victory. only to lose at the
hands of the judges. 'l‘onight would
be no different. For Ali had l'loutcd

to stick it somewhere unseemly. and
come out on top. And that meant a

and voice soft. “1 did the best 1
could.“ Ali was humbled. The young
men in the bar were calling him fool,
fool to have fought Spinks when he
could have left the sport the way he
had entered it: it Champion.

it was then and not earlier when
the decision Wits announced that the

as myth. 'l‘ime had broken him and
the crown taken away at last.

The wound within us all had
surfaced onto Ali full blown and
devoured him. We were hurt. not at
the falling of a champion. A great
and lovely symbol was receding into
the distance. and with its rctrciit. our
own vulnerability rose to the lore.
