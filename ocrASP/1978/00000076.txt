Defensive Effort Is Key

A ﬁred up Albany State varsity
basketball team raced to an early
lead and stunned the Plattsburgh
Cardinals 89—42, Tuesday night at

New distribution requirements
may be in store for SUNYAstudents
this fall. according to Office for
Academic Affairs representative
Leonard Lapinski.

Students may be required to
choose courses from each of eight

"goal" areas during their four years '

at SUNYA.

These areas correspond to skills
which thc Undergraduate Academic
Council's Curricultim Conmiittce
feels SUNYA students should
develop before graduating.

'l he proposed requirements are
the result of a UAC review of the
final report of tltc Special
Committee to Review the
Undergraduate Experience. The
SCRUE report proposed that each
student “earn at least nine credits iii
cach of the two colleges outside of
the college of his or her major."

'1 he deficiency budget now passes to the Senate floor to be voted on
Tuesday. If it is passed. as expected. the TAP incrcases for private
sector schools included in that budget will take effect.

For t be public sector increases to pass. the Miller/ Kremer bill must
either be taken to the Senate floor or to the Senate Higher Education
Committee. which has yet to meet this year.

The possibility exists that the Senate may pass the deficiency budget

Other areas being considered by

SCRUE report and trying to come
up with an alternate plan." said UAC

Dave Gellman. “The SCRUE report
does not guarantee a liberally -

The SCRUE report enumerated
eight goals of a liberal education.

framework of SUNYA‘s colleges of

WCDB will not begin scheduled

The radio station lins been given a
sanction by the University to begin
broadcasting from Mohawk Tower
and should be oii the air next week.
according to WCDB General
Manager Paul Rosentlial. but the
objections raised by the ASRC
caused the station to miss its original

to discuss the research center‘s
objections.

“We had a lot of experience with

"The station will be transmitting

SA Student Alliance Pickets Legislature

by J.M. Reilly

More than fifty SUNYA students
showed up at the Legislative Office
Building Wednesday to participate
iii the picketing and lobbying effort
organized by SUNYA‘s Student
Alliance.

The turnout represented about
one-half of the people who had
signed tip to take part in the
demonstration on the Quad dinner
lines earlier in the week.

After picketing foraboul an hour.
the delegation divided tip into 15
groups and moved inside the
Legislative Office Building to itieel
individually with more than sixty
legislators. with whotn they
discussed repeal of the health fee.
TAl' equity. restoring EOP stipend
tenant protection from

cuts.

 

retaliatory cvictioit and medicaid
funding of abortions.

The Student Alliance. a coalition
of groups that incltides SASU. SA.
SUM. NYPlRU. the Off-Campus
Association. the Albany State
University lllnck Association.
l-‘uerzu Latina, Feminist Alliance.
and the Putt-Caribbean Association.
was prirnnrily formed to trike part in
this week‘s lobbying efforts.
according to SASU delegate Sharon
Ward. Ward said that the Alliance
may continue as an active group. but
future plans and activities for the
group have yet to be discussed.

According to SA Vice President
Ktitliy Baron. the picketing was held
to provide the lobbying effort with
tnedlu exposure. The demonstration
was covered by two area

newspapers. as well as Channel 6
News and at least one local radio
station. according to Baron.

Although there was some
variation in the responses the
legislators gave. Baron said the
Alliance “received a lot of support
on both repeal of the health fee and
TAP equity."

SASU legislative intern Bennett
Dresser predicted that “they‘re ready
to give us the health fee issue. but
there‘ll probably be some kind of
compromise worked ottt on TAP
equity."

Responses to the other issues
seemed in general less positive and
more varied. “Most of the legislators
l spoke to requested more
information on the retaliatory

eviction issue before tbfy would

 

commit themselves one way or the
other." said Baron.

Although Baron said she
cncotintered little trouble
convincing legislators of the merits
of restoring EOP stipend cuts.
Dresser suid EOP would be "the
most difficult issue to push, because
it has the narrowest constituency.“

The issue that seemed to receive
the greatest variety of responses was
the Medicaid funding of abortions.
According to SASU representative
and Feminist Alliance member
Diane Picbc. “the abortion issue is a
lot more volatile than the others.
There are some legislators who
wholly support it. and those
philosophically and mortiin
opposed to abortion who flatly reject
it."

temporary. so we stopped
construction."

Instead of constructing
permanent cables. the station is
having temporary lines installed by
N. Y. Telephone Co. The telephone
lines will cost the station about $90 a
month, Rosenthal said.

“As of today. the telephone
company said that the lines will be
activated Monday."

The first complaint the ASRC
raised to the station transmitter
wasn't made until just prior to the
construction of the antenna.

Falconer said he was unaware of
the construction plan until he
received a letter from the Federal
Communications Commission
which was mistakenly sent to
Mohawk Tower in September. He
said that he complained to a
representative of the Educational
Communications Center, but was
given no specific answers. Falconer's
first contact with the radio station
management was when Rosenthal
sent the department a letter
informitig them that the
construction would begin.

“We called them as a courtesy to
inform them that we were installing
the equipment." said Roscnthal.
“This was after the space had been
allocated by the space Allocations
