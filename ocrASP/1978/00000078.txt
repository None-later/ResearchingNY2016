concerning matters such as security
deposits and utilities. However.
questions, about checking accounts
and auto accidents also come to the
attention of the legal services staff.
according to lump Andy Thaber.

‘Another group which handles
landlord/tenant disputes and is
loosely coordinated 'with legal
services is the Off-Campus

OCA and SA Legal Services
worked together - on releasing
students from their housing
contracts with the Country Squire
Motel. which was used last semester
to provide housing for (all SUNYA
students. Students complained
repeatedly about lack of
transportation. heating problems
and virtually allwere given alternate
housing for the spring semester.

The OCA staff is also attempting
to take a proactive stance on issues
which affect off-campus students.
According to paralegal Tim
Ledwith. the staff took a survey of

student apartments to determine
how many received a Ceniﬁcate of
Occupancy; a statement issued by
the city of Albany asserting that the
dwelling is in good condition. They
found that many landlords had
failed to obtain this document
because of th’eg“anti—grouping law."
This ordinance forbids more than
three unrelated people from sharing
an apartment.

Many student apartments have
more ‘than three occupants.
according to Ledwith.

Ledwith said DC A intends to
work with Lester on changing the
anti-grouping stature and enforcing
the certificate of occupancy ruling.

Another issue that OCA
paralegals iind SA legal services have
in common is registration of olf-
campus students in Albany election
districts.

"A lawyer named Brickwcdde is
Syracuse has a test case which wotild
change the law about student
voting.“ said Lester. llut Lester said
he is itot planning a test case in
Albany.

“We‘ll let Brickwedde handle it.
Ills case is iii the Court ol'Appeals

  

vote in Albany." said Lester:
spending a few days in the legislature
and I‘ll be talking to Jerry Koenig.
Council _of the Election Law
Committee.“ '

Even if a test case could be
arranged. Lester himself would not
be able to handle it. since he failed
his ﬁrst barexamination and will not
know whether he passed his second
until May. I .

As mandated in the original
retainer agreement. the Legal Task
Force Committee was reconvened
after it was learned that Lester
hadn‘t passed the bar. The
Committee‘s decision was to cut
Lester's S|0.000 salary by 20 per cent
but retain him on the staff of legal
services. according to Committee
Chair Paul Feldman.

The decision-making process also
served as an informal review of the
legal services program. according to
Feldman.

A change being considered in the
retainer agreement iniolves
dropping the student vs. student
conflict ofintercst clause. the clause
which states that the first student to
ask legal services for advice III a
student against student problem will

said Feldman.

and the second

- student, will he provided with up to

‘ ato.légtilcounsel.
,l‘lt's "sort of arbitrary that way.“

According to Lester. if the clause
is dropped. then legal services will
not handle either student's case.

Currently. legal services is being
guided by a Legal Services
Committee which is co-direcied by
students Kim Burke an Carl Chu.

Lester sees the Committee as his
supervisors. he said. According to
Feldman. who views himself as an
advisor to the Committee, “the
program doesn‘t need much
decision-making. The committee
takes care of ordering certain things.
making sure things are being litkcn
care of. and they interpret the
retainer."

Neither llurke nor ('liu cot.ld bc
reached for comment.

tester said he was pleased who the
job SA was doing on legal SCI‘\ICi‘\
and that lie would continue to work
for legal services if his contract \\L'lL‘
renewed next year.

“I've been asked for hpr by otliL‘i
schools who are setting up legal
services programs." he said.

He plans to attend a nation-unh-

Non-lunctioning lights on the roadway between Dutch and tuition

Roadway Lights Out .
From Dutch to Indian

by Laura Schraub

Although the lights on the
roadway between Dutch and Indian
Quads have been out for at least one
and one-half weeks. ofﬁcials at the
SUNYA Plant Department and
Public Safety Department don't
know what is causing the problem
nor how long it will be tintil the lights
are repaired.

If tlte problem is located in the
base of the poles or if a power line
underground is broken. the repairs
cannot begin tintil ice and snow on
the road hmc melted. according to
SIINYA Plant Senior Maintcnencc
Supervisor Donald King.

King said he is waiting for a break
in the weather to fix non-functioning
lights in the Dutch parking lot as
well.

“The islands that the lights sit on is
where all the snow has been plowed.“
he said. and in some places there are
at least six feet ofsnow covering the
lamp bases. '

Public Safety Department
Assistant Director John Henighan
said “We have never experienced any
security problems between Dutch
and Indian because of a lack of
lighting." Security in that area will
ttot be increased while the lights are
out.
