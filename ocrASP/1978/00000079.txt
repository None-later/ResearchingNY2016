Former SUNYA President
Emmett Fields. who left in August to
assume the presidency of Vanderbilt
University in Nashville. Tenn.. has
become embroiled in a controversy
over the participation of South
Africa in the Davis Cup Tennis
matches to be held at Vanderbilt
March l7-l9.

The NAACP has put pressure on
Vanderbilt to forbid South Africa‘s
participation in the matches because
of that country‘s policy of apartheid
or racial segregation.

Field‘s office. after repeated
phone calls, said he was unavailable
for comment. but Vanderbilt
Director of Public information Jan
Beichcr said “there is no question“
but that South Africa will not be
expelled from the matches.

Fields and Vanderbilt Chancellor
Alexander Heard made the decision
not to accede 'to the NAACP:
demands “because Vanderbilt has
always had a well-established policy
of being an open forum." accordin
to Beleher. '

Negotiation Meeting

A New York spokesman for the
NAACP, Denton Watson. said
yesterday that NAACP Executive
Director Benjamin Hooks has met
with Fields repeatedly to negotiate
the issue.

“The reports from Hooks are that
meetings with Dr. Fields havebeen
cordial. but that their position
remains the same: the university will
not withdraw its support from the
matches." he said.

Earlier this week, the NAACP
called for mass demonstrations at

 

the matches should Vanderbilt
refuse to change its position.

“As many 'as.50. and as few in
half dozen” demonstrators. have
been'gathering daily in front of
Vanderbilt’s Kirkland Hall. Belcher
said. Vanderbilt has 7000 students
and a faculty of two.

Signed Petition

In a new development in the
controversy, Belcher reported that
200 Vanderbilt students have signed
a petition supporting the
university‘s decision to allow South
Africa to partcipate in the tennis

'games. . .

Vanderbilt‘s Divinity School, the
most vocal segment of the'campus in
the dispute. had earlier presented the
administration with a petition
calling for the cancellation of the
matches.
