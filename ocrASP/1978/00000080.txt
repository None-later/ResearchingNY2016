LAP OF LUXURY

It‘s not exactly what you’d call a
“dog’s life" at the American Pet
Motel in Prairie View, Illinois.

Both “deluxe'f and “imperial”
accomoylations. as well as 24-hour
stereo music and special diets are
among the attractions at the pet
motel. which claims it will board
anything “that‘s manageable and
non-poisonous."

The pet motel‘s "imperial section"
modestly boasts artiﬁcial grass
carpeting and miniature brass beds
with mattresses and clean linens. The
doggic guests in the "imperial
section“ get two cookie breaks daily.
Pouches in the "deluxe" area. on the
other hand, have vinyl carpetingand
get a merconc cookie break per day.

Prices at the Prairie View lodgings
range from $4.35 to $9.35 for dogs
and $3.95 to $6.l0 a day for cats and
can. upon request. include such
special diets as scrambled eggs. roast
beef and macaroni and cheese.

THE RUTLES

'llic Beatlemania revival may
soon have some tough competition
lrom . . . "Rutlemania."

Warner Brothers records says it
“11' soon release the long-awaited
“Farewell and Debut Album“ by
what it calls one of Britain's
“supergroups.”

The album. titled “The Rutlcs."
“I” include a booklet describingthc
almost historic career of the Rullcs.
Ilie band has also completed itslirst
movie. tilled "All Yoti Need Is
('asli." which will be televised
nationally in the US on March 22.

In addition to members of the
partially-legendary Rutlcs. "All You
Need Is Cash“ will star Mick and
Iiiitnca Jagger. Ron Wood. Paul
Simon and George Harrison. This

LOGIC AND REASON

Forbes magazine is reporting. in
case you're interested. that there is a
difference between the human way
of thinking and computer thinking.

The magazine says that a number
of people were asked which kind of
watch they‘d prefer to keep. one that
will not run at all. or another that
loses seven seconds each day. The
humans. naturally. chose the watch
that ran.

A computer. however. which was
asked the same question. chose the
timepiece that had stopped
completely. The reason? The
computer figured out that the
stopped watch would show the
correct time twice each day; but the
one that lost seven seconds each day
would only be correct about once
every 2000 years.

HOT ROCKS

A scientist combing the Antarctic
continent has found two meteorites
reportedly containing the basic
building blocks of life that
originated in outer space.

The two meteorites are among 3I0
collected by University of Pittsburgh
scientist Dr. William Cassidy several
months ago.

l'lrc meteorites are reported to be
ol a rare class knotvn as
“carbonaceous chondritcs." and
carry a variety of life‘s building
blocks. including amino acids from

Scientists suspect that _ the
chemicals within such meteorites
represent a preparatory step in the
evolution of life forms. They may
have originated in the nebula which
formed the sun and the earth and
other planets. scientists believe.

The meteorites are being brought
back in airtight canisters for study by
the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.

(pronounced Planet-ran.)

Planetran in the proposed
transcontinental subway system
which would enable you to speed
underground from New York to Los
Angclcs in 2| minutes. at the rate of
14.000 miles per hour.

The super subway isthc brainchild
of Robert Salter. a Rand
Corporation physicist. who says the
bullet-shaped cars of Planetran
would ride on waves of magnetism
the way a surfboard rides the ocean's
waves. Salter told the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science this week that l’lunetran
could he built with current
technology for around $250 billion.

BRAIN WAVES

How do you turn an ordinary
person into an unwilling killer'.l

Newly released documents
obtained by the New York Times
indicate that this very question was
the subject of considerable study by
the CIA in thc mid-l950‘s.

The docunients._.obtained under
the Freedom of Information Act.
were prepared as part of a project
code-named “Artichokc.“ one of
four highly secret CIA programs
involving mind control experiments
from I949 to I974.

According to the project
Artichoke papers. a team of
interrogation and drug experts and
psychiatrists were asked to evaluate
whether an individual could be made
“to perform an act of attempted
assassination involuntarily against a
prominent politician. or ifneccssaiy.
against an American official.“

The papers go on to suggest that

  
  

    
  

the 

drugged and then “induced . to . g _ regions
betow. indicating that unusual

perform "the act ' of! attempted
assassinationat some other date."
They add that after the
assassination. “it was assumed the
subject would be taken into custody"
by authorities and thereby “disposed
of."

The Times reports that while there
is no indication that the CIA
attempted to use mind control in an
assassination attempt. the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence
reported in I976 that the agency had.
in fact plotted at least three foreign
assassinations.

WEATHER REPORT

If you want to blame somebody
for the cold. wet winter most of us
are experiencing, maybe you can
blame the Soviets.

A former Pentagon think tank
researcher is suggesting that low
energy radio experiments. secretly
conducted by the Soviet government
since 1976. are directly responsible
for the cold winters that have hit
most of the North American
continent for the past two years.

Lowell Ponte. a researcher with
the Pentagon until I970. says that
the Soviet Union has been
experimenting with “high-energy—
pulsed radio signals on certain

‘ frequencies (which)could change the

earth's magnetic ﬁeld." and hence its
weather.

l’ontc claims the Soviets are
testing the theories of Slavic
inventor Nikola Tesla. an eccentric
genius who lived earlier this century.
and is described as the Soviets‘
Thomas Edison. According to
Pontc. Tesla predicted that certain
frequencies of radio waves beamed
into the upper atmosphere would
alter the ionosphere. having radical
effects on worldwide weather
patterns.

Ponte says the Soviets aren't
trying to sabotage out weather. but
instead are attempting to alter cold
spells in Central Russia which are
threatening to ruin their own crops.
Their experiments. he claims. are
adversely affecting the weather
worldwide.

What's more. says the former
Pentagon researcher. these alleged
Soviet weather experiments are

Ponte also says that the Canadian
government has secretly protested to
the Soviets about the alic'pd
experi ments. but has not yet received
a response.

SECOND THOUGHTS'

A Dartmouth College
climatologist is blaming this winter’s
cold weather on. of all thirty.
volcanoes.-

Doctor Robert Decker says a
series of studies dating back to the
time of Benjamin Franklin indicate
that the winter seasons following
major volcanic eruptions around the
world are always unusually cold.

Decker says that volcanoes
erupted with three times the normal
frequency last year. spewing ﬁne
particles of dust into the earth's
upper atmosphere. He suggests that
these dust particles create enough
haze to interfere with normal
sunlight patterns.

WHAT NEXT?

The Wall Street Journal says that
the next Food and Drug
Administration battle won‘t be over
laetrile. or even the sugar substitute
sacharrin.

The Journal reports that the
newest controversy is likely to be
over a substance little known to
Americans called the betel
(pronounced “beat|e“) out.

The newspaper says the FDA has
outlawed the interstate sale of the
hotel out on the groundsthe small,
chewey nut might cause cancer.

However. a representative of the
l00.000 residents of the tiny U.S.
territory of Guam. contends that the
nut. which has been chewed byGuan
residents for hundreds of years. is
merely a mild stimulant.

The Journal reports that Guam
representative to Congress. Antonio
Won Pat. has. as a result. introduced
a bill to ease the FDA betel nut ban.
saying it is based less on scientiﬁc
evidence than on culturalprcjudice.

Pat says that if the FDA is so
worried about cancer-causing
substances. they should ban tobacco
first.

NEW TACTIC

The Greenpeace Foundation. the
anti-whaling organization. will try a
different tactic this year for saving
whales: friendly persuasion instead
of confrontations at sea.

Ross Tlrornwood. the president of
the Hawaiian chapter of
Greenpeace. says the organization‘s
l75-foot converted subchaser will
make friendly calls on Japanand the
Soviet Union this spring and
summer.
