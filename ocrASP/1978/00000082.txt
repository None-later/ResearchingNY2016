By MARK .l. MCGARRY

he science ﬁction anthology of

original material is not dead.

though its pulse may be Weak

and erratic. l have a pair 0f

books here that present over
40 stories altogether, the majority of them
appearing in print here for the ﬁrst time.
With that much material. i won’t be
reviewing each individual piece.

Orbit l9 (Harper and Row. $9.95) is
edited by Damon Knight. Orbit has a
long and distinguished history. and
stories included in the volumes over the
years have won many Nebula and Hugo
awards. Recent volumes have been top-
heavy with fantasy. obscure literary
work. and various types of unclassiﬁable
material. At this time. no paperback
publisher has picked up the rights forthis
volume. or the series. and Harper and
Row won‘t carry it beyond volume 2! due
to sales. Perhaps in order to boost sales.
this volume of (Mill appears to be slanted
towards more traditional forms of science
fiction.

Twelve authors are represented with
thirteen stories (Gene Wolfe hastwo)and
all are readable and entertaining. ln
subject matter they range from John
Varlcy‘s “Lollipop and the Tar-Baby."
about a sentient and dishonest black hole.
to "Matty Mansions" by Gene Wolfe,
which is sort of abotit sentient and sneaky
hottscs. (It is always difficult to
suinmiiri/c a Wolfe stories; they always
have at least three levels ol meaning.)

Other authors represented arc Kate
Wilhelm. helix (iotschalk. R.A. Laffcrty.
Stephen Robiitett. Michael W.
McClintock. Michael Connor. l’hillip
'l'eich. Kevin O‘Donnell .lr.. Eleanor
Artiason. and Kim Stanley Robinson.
This is one of the liner of anthologies
produced in the last few years; hopefully
the series will continue.

Future Par/inter edited by Scott
Edclstcin (Aurora Books. $6.95) is in
most ways. something altogether
different. This is the second in a series of
theme anthologies which Aurora hits
published. and apparently the rest of the
series has been aborted due to poor sales.
The book is well-produced and chI-
edited. and certainly more than
reasonably priced.

would ﬁnd that particular activity droll.

The book maintains a high level of
writing and readability throughout. but
very few of the stories are really
outstanding. I sometimes wonder if
editors who concentrate on theme
anthologies are not limiting the quality of
their material when they limit their
subject matter.

he heroine wears a pin-striped

bookie suit right out of a

Grade B l940‘s movie. The

hero looks like a defeated

World War I ﬂying ace and

the supporting cast consists of a

potpourri of aging gods. prostitutes. and
assorted riff-ruff.

It sounds more like a collection of
extras from a Warner Brother‘s
extravaganza than the characters of a
significant theatrical work. Yet. Edward
(ioldcn has integrated a highly political
script, large cast. and innovative set into a
unified. incisive evening of theatre. The
(ioml Woman ol’SeIzuan is the best play

tricks which defy belief. The ambiguous
ending then. has a heightened impact for
which we ltavc been prepared and yet
never expect.

The company performed well as a unit.
lliliiric Delinan shines as both the gentle-
ittanncrcd. soft spoken Shen 'l‘e and the
crisp. efﬁcient. deep-voiced Shui-Ta. The
transitions between the two characters
are sensitive and believable. Delman‘s
voice. movement. and timing is utterly
consistent and it delight to watch.

Steven Mtimrow providesjust the rigltt
combination of pompousncss, self-

    

 

rightcousncss. and humor asthe First god
and Laura Nichols gives a ﬁne
performance as Mrs. Shin who aids Shui
Ta in hiding his true identity. Steven

llookbcndcr provides comic relief as the.

lecherous. homely Mr. Shu Fu. His
portrayal of an old wealthy barber
courting Shen 'l‘c borders on the absurd
without being unbelievable.

The rest of the cast is adequate. though
uncxecptionul. Schuyler Rhodes is dull
and predictable as Wong. and Michael
llopp was too silly to be real as the elderly
god.

Lynda Salisbury‘s costumes are
creative and suitable. The set. comprised
of platforms and rcvolvcs is perfect and
the Shui 'l‘a mask looms in the
background as a reminder of what lies
behind Shen 'l‘c‘s goodness. William
Bauer‘s score punctuatcs the production

in the end. it is up to the audience. As
the Good Woman tells us, only we are
capable of improving a society that causes
a "good" woman heartache and misery.
Only we can rewrite the ending so that
Shcn Tc can live happily ever after.

Nevertheless, The Good Woman of
Seizuan leaves us satisﬁed —- not because
of its message. but because it has
accomplished its intent as a work of art.
The Good Woman ofSetzuan has had an

dissatisfaction with our culture and our
