A TTENTION SENIORS -
l

Although graduation is 3 months away.
don't forget to book a room for your parents
NOW it they will be requiring one.

As of February 15. the Ramada Inn is
already booked tor graduation weekend (May
27-28) as is the Holiday Inn.

The Tom Sawyer Inn. Travelodge. and
Nor-thway Inn are “going fast".

The reason they're being booked so quickly
is because the New York Women's Bowling
Tournament is being held here in Albany this
year. extending from May into J one so motels
and hotels are in demand.

You can probably find a room for your
parents now but we do urge you to do it
quickly. There are plenty listed in the yellow
pages.

The Housing Office will be arranging to
house parents on campus-more info. on that
‘ as we find out.

"Paatlcha"
Atlantic SD two:
The Manhattan Transfer

By DENNIS SCHEYER
pastiche. according to a
reputable man named
Webster. is “a musical
composition intended to
imitate or ridicule another

artist‘s style.“_

The Manhattan Transfer have been
recording their own brand of pastiche
since I969 when they formed. Since then
they have been a New York City cult
attraction selling out cabarcts and
garnering decent record sales.

Their latest album. it you haven‘t
guessed by now is called Pastt't'lu'. The
music is not for everybody by any means.
It is sappily nostalgic, intriguing at times,
and silly at others.

The band consists of Tim Hauser,
Laural Masse, Alan Paul and Janis
Siegel. In the true 40's tradition they play
no instruments, instead they are chansons
and chanseurs (vocalists!) 0n Pas/it'lte
they are backed up by Randy Brecker. Al
Cohn. Jim Gordon and a host ofothers.

The music on the album ranges from
Cole Porter‘s “Love for Sale" to Duke
Ellington's "In a Mellow ’l‘onc.” Both are
executed with fine harmonies. but
somehow seem very out ofplaccin I978.

The one saving grace of the album is the
Rupert Holmes composition, “Who,
What Where. Why.“ The cut was
produced by Steve Barri (of Grassroots
Fame). It is danceable. bright, and like
most of Holmes‘ songs it makes love the
most important thing in the world. it's
bound to be a hit single.

If you‘re one of those people still into
heavy nostalgia. Manhattan 'I‘ransfer‘s
new album I’UA'llt‘llt' gives it to you in a
double dose.

"I'm Ready"
lllur Sky .IZ 14928
Muddy Waters

By PETER SIGOURIS
s the title of' Muddy Waters'
latest release implies. Muddy
Waters has no intention of
retirihg from a life-time of the
blues. As a majorinnovatorin
both rural and urban blues in the ﬁfties
and sixties. Muddy‘s style inﬂuenced such

 

 

 

later day successes are The Rolling Stones

and The Ant... Brothers Band. He was

 

one of the early tone masters of the
electric guitar and to this day is widely
respected for his singing, playing, and
songwriting abililities.

There stands as a distinct Waters
characteristic that deep dedication to a
very personal blues style. After over thirty
years of survival amidst radical changes
in all ﬁelds ofptusic, Muddy‘s approach'
remain: consistent and genuine. I'm
Ready is a healthy follow-up for last
year's successful'llard Again.

The songs are a mixed selection of new
and old material. Some of the new stuff is
good, but it is truly the classic blues
numbers that highlight the album.
Despite many previous recordings of such
tunes as “I‘m Ready” or “Hoochic
Coochie Man.“ Waters still executes
these popular themes in a manner that is
both fresh and exciting. His rendition of
“Rock Me" ranks among the best and the
battd does justice to Sonny Boy
Williamson's “(iood Mornin‘ Little
School Girl.“

These quality performances. coupled
with a nice production job result in a
fairly light, rather enjoyable blues
package. Muddy Waters is one offhc best
in his field. and I'm Ready is an
acceptable offering from one of the
greatest influences on modern electric
blues.

    

“Montreux Summlt"
Columbia 10' 35005
Jan Greats

 

By JON BRESSNER

hen I first heard Montreux

Summit l was convinced that

it must be contraband because

in genereral, the law of this

land declares illegal anything
from which one can derive as much
pleasure as is obtainable from this album.
Montreux Summit is a live recording of
the Montreux Jazz Festival which took
place this past summer in Montreux.
Switzerland, and is. to put it bluntly, one
of the finest jazz albums released within
the past few years. The disc is well
recorded and boasts a wide array of
today‘s ﬁnest jazz musicians. However it
should be noted that this album contains
music which could be categorized as
anything from straight ahead bebop to
progressive rock.

The title track, “Montreux Summit," is
an original written by pianist Bob James
especially for the festival. it starts off with
a big band horn arrangement which
quickly turns into funk and then bebop.
The song is marked by searing solos by
Stan Getz on tenor, Woody Shaw on
horn, Janne Schaffer on guitar and Billy
Cobham on drums.

This double record jam session
represents a notable achievement in that so
many musicians of varying styles. tastes
and talent (from great to greatest) can get
together and play such incredible music.

album. Outstanding. superior and
beyond belief start to get the idea across
but the only way one can truly appreciate
this album ll to own it. I feel it my duty to
the world of music to highly recommend

Montreux Summit album as it will

"Storm Force Tan"
('ItU'm/is (‘HR II5/
Stashya Span

By ALAN ALPER
ith the release of Steeleye
Span‘s latest effort entitled,
Storm Force Ten. it appears
that the band is still caught in
a blatant identity crisis which
tends to obscure their musical direction.
The album ﬁnds them wavering
between their traditional British folk
roots. and shows them striving to obtain a

. more pop/rock sound which would be

more commercially rewarding. Yet. the

uring the ﬁrst eight months of
1977 3.450.859 foreign
visitors arrived in Greece. A
record-breaking 447.534 of
these were Americans.
0n the road from Athens to Elcusis
stood an ancient olive tree. Although
largely unnoticed by tourists, this tree is
traditionally believed to be the very one
under which Plato instructed his
students. More than a year ago this tree
was uprooted by a bus accident. It is
reported from Athens that the tree,
responding to careful daily attention. has
taken root again and is now protected by
a metal fence.

A Track and Held Hall of Fame is
under construction in Rushvillc. Indiana.
The cornerstone for the new building has
come from the ancient stadium of Delphi.
Legend has it thatall whotouch this stone
will gain greatly in strength.

A ﬁlm adaptation ofEuripides‘ tragedy
Iphigem‘a in Ault'.\‘ (not to be confused
with Iphigertia in Taurt's recently
performed at SU NYA) has been
produced by Michael Cacoyannis. who is
already well known for his ﬁlm versions
of Euripides' Electra and Trojan Women.

The Road To Athens

via the commercial route. ,

The addition of Carthy, brings to
Steeleye‘Span one of England’s foremost
folk artists. This allows the band's warm,
tonal qualities to come to the forefront.
At times the soft melodies lull you to
sleep, but as the group‘s direction seems
to gravitate towards rock, their
mellowness is lost behind a layer of pop
oriented dressing.

The album opens in typical Steeleye
Span style with a cut called, “Awake,
Awake." Their distinct traditional
arrangements come to light here, The
melodic overtones, combined with their
precise vocal harmonies, carry the listener
along the high seas.

The most ambitious cut on the album is
titled. “The Victory.“ This selection opens
with a guitar solo which is similar in style
to classical music while retaining its
characteristic folk sound. The song
rapidly reaches a climax alongthe stormy
seas of rock ‘n‘ roll. This is the only cut on
the album which is able to weather the
band's directional crisis. The meshing of
traditional folk with rock is facilitated
through some interesting accordian and
synthesizer work.

Maddy Prior‘s stark. strong vocals are
by far the best aspect ofthis LP. Her voice
is crystal clear as she lyrically tells the
tales of the ocean deep.

0n the whole the album has its
interesting moments, but due to the
band's inability to provide the listener
with a definable course to follow, this LP
becomes tedious and sometimes boring.
The potential for a respectable album is
there, but until Steeleye Span decides
where their musical heads are at, their
lack of dynamics precludes one from
listening attentively.

A bronze statue ofa Victorious Young
Athlete has been acquired by the J. Paul
Getty Museum of Malibu. California.
The statue is the work of Lysippus, who
served as sculptor to Alexander the
Great. lts estimated value is between
three and five million dollars. Ofﬁcials of
the Getty Museum attempted to avoid a
six percent California sales tax by
displaying the statue temporarily at the
Denver Art Museum. But. alas. the Getty
Museum must now ﬁght the tax
collectors of the State of Colorado and
the City of Denver. who are trying to
collect the same amount in use tax.

Professor Manolis Andronikos of the
University of Salonica created quite a stir
among archaclogists and historians
recently when he announced that he had
found the tomb of Philip H of
Macedonia. Philip ll ruled from 359 to
336 B.C. and was the father of Alexander
the Great. The tomb was discovered in the
village of Vergina. 30 miles southwest of
Salonica. Protected by a large mound. the
tomb had escaped tomb robbers through
the centuries and consequently was rich in
burial objects of gold, silver, bronte. and
ivory. The bones of the king were
contained in a casket of solid gold, which
in turn was contained in a sarcophagus of
white marble. Of equal importance to
archaeology is a painting of a royal

 

hunting scene found above the tomb
entrance.
