To the Editor:

In his article "llakkc Myths“ In the let). l7

opinion that medical school quotas are just
and should be continued. l disagree.

Mr. (‘oironeo believes that Alan llakkcnas

California at Davis Medical School's quota
system. The fact is that in all objecmc criteria
for admission. Bukke had qualifications
superior to tltosc (If the majority students
accepted. Although subjective criteria such as
linterviews and personal essays are also given
high priority in the selectioir process. and larii
unable to comment on llakke‘s prei'orniancc
in these areas. the fact that the objective
qualifications of minority students accepted at
schools with similar quotas are consistttntly
lower than those of whites accepted. clearly
indicates that nun-whites are gi\cn special
privileges. i cannot say whether liakke himself
was rejected because oi'ilie qiioia system. I can
say that quotas result in the rejection of some
better qtialificd applicants because ol the color,
of their skirt.

Medical school quotas are discriminatory-
they involve the preferential treatment of one
group of people over another because of
factors such as racial. ethnic. and sexual
differences. the only diflei'cnce between
quotas titid other forms of discrimination is
the identity of the group ailcctcd.

recently. l gazed upon an anomalous sight:
two small. decayed. barely readablc stickers
on the wall. Each proclaimed: March to end
the War! Out Now! Stop the Bombing! How
strange those stickers appeared. How strange
compared to the serenity and calm of our
campus rind student body. It scents we are
separated from the l960's by more than just
years. But we all know the turbulence ofthose
years is gone. probably for the better.

We all know the I97i)‘s represents a new
period. a period of introspection. a period in
which thousands of students come to a higher
uni\ersity and opt for a forin of vocational
training and become business or accounting
majors.

lixccpt for a lew well-entrenched Zionist
groups. political consciousness is dead. But
there are a few. a very few. who still cling
tenacioust In some of tire ideas and
movements of the 1960's. On certain select
days, one can see these remainingadherents of
the New left in the Campus Center, selling
their newspapers. peddling their ideas. ’l’hey
are ignored by iiiosi. ridiculed by others. or
simply dismissed as failures or even loncrs
who have become obsessed wrtlt an otttdatcd
idea as some form oi surrogate love. Perhaps
they are an anaclironisni. but however bitterly
one disagrees with them. they are worthy of
admiration. Here. I would simply like to salute
those relics of a less cyiiicitl and more hopeful
period. those who still have a vision. those
remnants of the 1960's.

The idea is still a good one. The bars would beneﬁt, SA would finally
have something it could point to and call a success. and, most
importantly, the students would beneﬁt. The hope is that with the
proper coordination, the Bar Bus will be barred from becominganother
bust.

Stipend Ineptitude

Student Association is finally following through on its stipend plan
for leaders of its major organizations. And it is doing so in what has
become a grand tradition of ineptitude in this area.

The Stipend Committee‘s recommendations for stipend payments has
got to rate as one ofthe more ridiculous efforts to come out of SA this
year. It doesn‘t treat the speciﬁc jobs student leaders hold as entities.
Rather. it goes into the backround and personality ofcvery student who
applied for a stipend.

Throughout the committee’s recommendations. such things as “she
refs excessively . . . (about the president of WlRA), “well, he's a
business major and this looks good on his restime‘.". . “ appear.

It is things like this which show that the current stipend policy is a
llop. it’s not even a policy  it‘s just a loosely set up plan to have a
committee each year dole out stipends to whomeverthey want to —— and
probably more important ~-- whomever they like the best.

A stipend policy should be set up which designates payments by
position. not personality.

This however. is being aimed at those who might be leading next
year‘s SA. Judging from experience. this year‘s SA elite seems intent on
continuing the grand tradition of stipend policy ineptitude.
