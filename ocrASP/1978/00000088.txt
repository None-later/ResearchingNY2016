Ah integral part of any team's

success is the health of its membersl
Throughout the course of any
season. various injuries
occur from pulled
muscles to separated
shoulders. At Albany
State. the members of the men‘s
intercollegiate athletic programs are
given immediate treatment for
almost any sports-related injury in
the menfs training room.

Depending on the extent of the
injury. reconditioning programs are
set up to help speed up the recovery
of the injured athlete. Heading the
men‘s athletic training room for the
last four years is Jack Koclmcl. a
graduate of Norwich University.

Koclmcl‘s link with athlcti is
extensive and goes back to his own
high school days at Searlcs High in
Mass. where he lettered in varsity
basketball and football for four
years and varsity golf for two years.
At Norwich he played basketball for
two ycttrs and football l'oronc year.

In I‘lo9. Jack went to Europe with
the Norwich soccer team as their
trainer. Ilicii in l970-7l he was a
trainer arid coach of soccer and
basketball at Sacred Heart High
School in Vermont. where he also
taught Physical Education and
general inutli.

lironi I97 I -7J Koclmcl completed
his graduate \\ ork at SUNYA. where
he was also It graduate assistant iii
the training room. He became the
head trainer in I974 ul'tci tltc death

of Charles “Spud” Kruzan. the
previous head trainer. Koelmel also

instructs volleyball. racquetball;

badminton. tennis and a course in
the Care and Prevention of Athletic
Injuries. ‘

His graduate assistant is Bob
Spertzel. Spertzel played college
football for three years and
gymnastics for two years at Lock
Haven State College. There. he
earned his BS. in Health. Physical
Education and Recreation with a
specialization in athletic training.

In addition. Koelmcl has several
student assistant trainers. Pete
Martin and Rich Lakis. two seniors.
have worked for the last three years.
Martin. a biology student. played
basketball his freshman year while
Lukis. a business major. played
football and lacrosse.

Mike Dinct and Pat I-Icnncssey.
both juniors. are working in their
ﬁrst and third years. respectively.
IIcnncsscy is also a biology student
while Diiict is a history major. Dinet
also plays defense for the varsity
“CFOSSC tca I‘ll.

Rounding out the staff are
volunteers Joel Scliciisiil. who was
himself a graduate and
undergraduate assistant trainer for
the last several years. and Mike
Yagcr. an area Physical liducation
teacher who has a special interest in
sports medicine.

The job of the trainer is an
important one as any of Albany‘s
athletes will tell you. lie helps

the team physician; Dr. Philip Van
Orden. the coaches. and the athletes.
According to a National Athletic
Trainers Association publication.
“the trainer must be well versed in

the functional. structural and}

biological human being. He must be
able to prevent athletic injuries as
well as know ﬁrst aid treatment and
emergency procedures for injuries."

During the past several years.
Koelniel and his staff have been
active in the administration of
reconditioning treatments for the
fall, winter and spring teams. In
l975. 76 and 77 over 6500 such
treatments were given duringthe fall
and over 3500 during the spring. It
has been found that through proper
care. reconditioning exercises and
use of therapeutic modalities such as
Whirlpools. injured athletes can
huslctt their recovery.

The training room, which is
located in the men's locker room. is
open from 8:30 am. until 6:30 p.m.
Koelmcl has been very helpful to
many students in suggesting various
reconditioning exercises. However,
dtic to the extensive use of the
facilities by varsity athletes. the
training room is not available to all
students unless treatments are
prescribed by a physician.

In addition to ice and warm
whirlpool baths. the training room is
equipped with hydroculator heating
packs. Iicat lamps, and ankle and
knee reconditioning machines. An_
ice machine supplies the ice that is
required for most injuries during the
first 48 hours.

there are also several tables on
which ihc athletes are tu'pcd before
games and practicing and
strapping of ankles or knccs for
example. is a preventative measure
employed by thc staff to keep new
injuries from happening and old
injuries from reoccurring.

So the next time you hear how an
Albany State football. lacrosse. or
basketball player is injured one week
and playing the next. think of the
dedication of Koclmcl and his staff.
us they try to contribute to thc
success of Albany‘s men‘s teams.
