FEBRUARY 24, 1978

by More Shelnblum

Battling two tough opponents this
past Saturday. the Albany State
swimming and diving team came
away with two very satisfying
victories. They defeated Buffalo and
Binghamton, by scores of 85-68 and
its-47. respectively. The wins. which
put Albany‘s record at 9-2. was
particularly sweet since it was the
first time the Danes had ever
defeated a Buffalo squad.

Steve Rehfuss showed the winning
way. taking thrcecvents. He ﬁnished
first in the 50 and too yard freestyles
and the 200~yard breaststroke. with
respective times of 23.0. 50.4 and
2:191).

A new pool record was set by Bob
(lozcnbach in the ZOO-yard butterﬂy.
Gozcnbach‘s mark of 2:0].4 also
broke his personal record which he
achieved while swimming at
Frcdonia.

"Overall it was a fine team
performance.“ remarked Dancs'
Coaclt Ron White. “I think a lot of
our depth sltowcd up in this meet."

Part of that depth was displayed
by the ADO-yard freestyle relay team
of Mike Dwycr, Stephen Stroms.
Mitch Cohen. and (jozenbach. The
four man team finished first in
3:295.

It was a close meet all the way.
with Albany and Buffalo staying
neck and neck throughout.
llinghamton was close, but in the
end. thcy couldn‘t stay with their
SUNYAL' counterparts. With three
events remaining tn the meet,
Albany and Buffalo wcrc
deadlocked at 60-00.

" that was when the tttrnittg point
came for us.“ claimed White. “We
came into our power events."

Sure enough. thc ncxt cvcnts did
put Albany on top. First came
Rchfuss' victory in the breaststroke.
lltit the pcoplc who really broke
Buffalo‘s back were Joe Shore and
Jeff Cohen. who finished third and
fourth in that event.

Normally, only tltc first tltrcc
places receive points. but due to thc
thrce~wny tncct. officials wcrc
\Cttt‘lllg for fch places. l'hcrcforc.

' 

Albany outscored Buffalo "-1 in the ‘
. the one-meter required and optional

breaststroke to give them a clear cut
victory. ' '
“It wasquite satisfying to handle

Buffalo.” remarked White. “We've 'r

always come close. but we've always
seemed to come out on the short end
of the stick."

Another major contribution came
from Dave Rubin. Rubin ﬁnished
ﬁrst in the I000-yard freestyle. and
had two key second-place ﬁnishes in
the ZOO-yard backstroke and 500-
yard freestyle events.

Bill Derkasch ﬁnished ism 

diving eventl. . . .

Despite . tut .. weeki ion ‘ ~to
Oneonta, the team it in great spirits.
They have no major injuries to speak
of, with the SUNYAC
Championships coming up in
Oswego this Thursday. '

First they must travel to St.
M ichaels tomorrow for an afternoon
meet. But Albanycan't help but look
ahead to the conference
championships.

Gymnasts Top Bridgewater

Winning their third consecutive
meet, the Albany State women‘s
gymnastics squad edged
Bridgcwater last Saturday, l03.8-
l0l.7.

The floor exercises proved to be
Albany‘s greatest strength, as they
placed three of the top four ﬁnishers.
Corinne Pulma won the event, with
teammates Carla Landsman and
Mary Ann Caperna copping’the
second and third spots, respectively.
liridgcport‘s Sue Ganlcy tied

Capema for third place.

Landsman and Ganley then
battled in the vaulting event. where
they ﬁnished in a first-place tie. In
the uneven parallel bars. Caperna
and teammate Cindy Cobane took
the ﬁrst two spots.

Bridgewater swept the balance
beam, as Albany has had itstroubles
in this event.

The Danes face Hofstra today and
West Point tomorrow in their next
two contests.

Leon Still Has
Much To Learn

NEW YORK (AP) The black
gunfightcr‘s Ital was enough to draw
stares when he walked through life
lobby of a midtown hotel. But there
were also tentative glances of
recognition for the new heavyweight
champion of the world.

Lcon Spittks was in the higtown. it
town where Muhammad Ali once
said: "I can walk down tltc street and
cause a traffic jam."

It was a week ago Wednesday that
Leon Spinks awoke as the
heavyweight champion of the world.
conqueror of “The Greatest" and he
says now “I haven‘t really gotten into
it. I still got a lotofthingstolcarn."

But the 24-year-old veteran of
eight pro fights indicated that he has
a winning attitude as he approaches
a job that could be much, much
tougher than beating Ali in the ring

battling the endless
comparisons that will be made
between him and Ali. possibly the
toughest act in the world to follow. It
is an act that hasn’t seen its last
curtain yet."

Spinks' approach is much more
subdued than his clothes: “Try to
understand me and you‘ll like me."

He was loose Wednesday night
during an interview for which he
were all black plus two false teeth
that plugged the now-famous
gupped tooth grin that can spell
malice as well as friendship.

“The whole world seen it,” Spinks
said of his stunning victory.
