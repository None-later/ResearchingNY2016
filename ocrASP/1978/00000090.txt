 1b  66-61,  164-97:-
Host Utioa Tbmorrow Nightln Key Game

by Eddie Emerrmn

If a movie were to be made on
Albany State's basketball team‘s
road trip last weekend, it might be
titled How The West We: Last.

Last Friday, the Danes travelled
to western Pennsylvania (Erie). to
play Gannon in search oftheir sixth
straight win. They didn‘t get it as
they lost. 66-61.

The University of Buffalo. an
unfriendly place for Albany (they
have never won there). was Albany‘s
next stop on their western trip.
Buffalo kept their home record
against Albany unblemished.
winning l04-97 in a wild shootout.

Against Gannon. the Danes took
a 3l-29 lead into the second half.
They opened the lead to 37-3l but
Gannon took charge the rest of the

way.

Tied at 40-11“ with IS minutesleft
to play. (iannon‘s Joe Blanks hit a
20-footer which gave Gannon a 42-
40 lead and they were never headed.

Slowly the Danes fell further and
further back and eight minutes later
found themselves trailing 57-47.
Gannon held that spread until two
minutes remained when Albany
began a desperate attempt to catch
up. Center Barry Cavanaugh hit live
straight points to close the gap to 53-

49 with 47 seconds left. But Albany
never got closer.Cavanaugh ﬁnished
as the game's high scorer with 25
points. Don Adamson led Gannon
with 20 while Blanks had l7.

Gannon outrebounded Albany
44-36 with Tony Jones pulling down
I]. Kelvin Jones led Albany with
seven. Jones saw much action
because forward Carmelo Verdch
was forced to leave the game with
only seven minutes elapsed because
of a sprained ankle.

While the Gannon contest was the
type of games the Danes like to
play—patient offense—the Buffalo
contest wasn't.

Both teams came out with loaded
pistols. shooting just about at will.
Unfortunately for the Danes.
Buffalo hit nine oftheir ﬁrst ten.and
l5 oftheir ﬁrst 20 to open upa 3l-l9
lead. But Albany fought back only
trailed by one. 43-42 at the half.

The second half was dcjavu for
Albany. Similar to the Gannon
game. the Danes led brieﬂy in the
second half at 46—43. The tennis then
traded baskets for the next schn
minutes. Buffalo's Sam Pellon and
Nate Bouie scored straight baskets
giving Buffalo the lead for good at
61-60.

Then Buffalo. just like Gannon.

opened up their lead to 97-83. And if

' that isn't enough similarity. the

Danes against rallied late—closing
the gap to 97-9l with 54 seconds left.
but again couldn‘t get closer.

“It just wasn‘t our type of game.”
said Albany Coach Dick Sauers
referring to the run-shoot Buffalo
game.

Cavanaugh again was the big gun
for Albany hitting a season-high 28
points. Verdejo. playing with a
bruised ankle. scored 19 points and
pulled down I4 rebounds.

For Buffalo. Pcllom led the way
with 29 points. l9 in the second half
while Larry Jones had 23. Albany
particularly got burned by a player
who once played as a Dane. Eddie
Johnson. who played here three
years ago scored 25 points. including
l5 points in the second half.

It has been the Danes' inability to
win most of the close games this year
in the closing minutes and this
weekend was no exception. “We lost
our poise.“ said Coach Sauers.
referring to both losses.

The two defeats lowered the
Danes. record to lI-9 with two
regular season games remaining.

According to Sauers. the Danes
are among six teams being
considered for three rcntainingspots

Free Throws: Albany hosts Utica

JV Five Nearing Record With Two Wins

by Paul Schwartz

Fourteen and two. Fourteen out
of sixteen. Won l4. lost 2. Anyway
it‘s stated. it still comes out as a
phenomenal record.

The Albany State junior varsity
basketball team won two more
games this week. Last Saturday they
defeated Hudson Valley 97-87. and
on Tuesday Oneonta fell to Albany
56-53.

Talent is something the Pups have
a wealth of. and every bit of it was
needed against a scrappy Oneonta
team. The play in the first half was
slow and methodical. with both
teams using patient offenses.

This type of play almost lulled the
fast breaking. high scoring Pups to
sleep. Still. Albany managed to
grind out a 36-24 halftime lead.

Oneonta came out with new life in
the second half. and the gnmeturncd
into a close battle. The absence of
guards Marty McGraw and Ron
Knox. both of whom did not make
the trip with the team. hurt the Pups.
What also hurt Albany was their
sluggish play. and if not for some
excellent foul shooting (l6 for 20).
they might have not come away with
a victory.

Down the stretch. Oneonta
narrowed the margin to two points
but then the Pups came to life.
Flawless ballhandling in last few
minutes gave Albany their
unspcctacular victory,

Jim Bittker and Lee Gardner
scored l l points each for the jayvccs,
while Erv Roberson was right
behind with ten.

“We didn't play well." said Albany
coach Bob Lewis. "They are not a
very good team. but we were not up
for the game. and it showed."

Oneonta's jayvccs have now lost
to Albany twice this year. Earlier in
the season. the Pups won by l9 at
home. Oneonta is getting closer. but
they are not in the same class as the
Pups

Last Saturday. Albany played a
tough Hudson Valley Community
College team that entered the game
with an impressive 17-4 record.
However. Albany was not
impressed. and came away with a ten
point victory.

This game was fast paced and
offensive minded. the type Albany
excels in. As the Pups learned.
Hudson Valley was also capable of
playing at a fast pace. and Albany
found themselves down by four at
the half.

 

Albany applied strong defensive
pressure and a half coUrt trap in the
second half. but Hudson Valley
would not roll over. With the score
til-80. the Pups finally took
command and ran off ten straight
points for the triumph.

Balanced scoring was the name of
the game for the Pups. as the entire
starting ﬁve scored in double ﬁgures.
Bittker and Roberson each had 22.
followed by Gardner with I6.
McGraw with 12. and Steve Low
adding ten points.

With four games remaining. the
jayvccs have adcfinitc shot at the all-
time best record for any Albany
jttyvce team. The record is l7 wins
and 3 losses. set in the 1973-74
season.

in a “slipshod manner”. according to

conclusion in 'a letter to former
Speech Pathology Chair Gcrlenc

Ross had been named by Millcrin

The long wait for WCDB to go on the air is almost over as the station
plans its debut broadcast for either tomorrow or Thursday.

Telephone lines are currently being installed between the station's
studios in the Campus Center and the transmitter atop Mohawk

Center that the transmission of radio signals by the station might
hamper weather research have resulted in the installation of temporary
lines rather than permanent lines. The temporary lines will remain
until a Settlement is reached by the station. the ASRC and the

On Dec. l5. I976. CAFE met to
consider the Miller complaints. Both
Ross and Moore refused to appear.
Last night. Ross explained her
failure to appear saying that, “My
rights would not be protected.
Anything I said could have been
used against me in a civil court.“
Ross said this didn't mean she had
done anything wrong.

In the letter to Ross. CAFE listed
each of the charges that Miller had
leveled against her. They found that
the department members were not
given enough information on Miller
before they voted. CAFE did not
charge Ross with intentionally
withholding information. but did
point om it was her responsibility to

~ provide it.

CAFE did find that the letters of
Transmittal were improperly
handled. and that Ross had
substituted a revised letter after Nov.
25. I975.

However. CAFE found
“insufﬁcient evidence" that Ross was
prejudiced against Miller. and no
evidence that the conﬁdentiality of
the dc artment‘s vote was violated.
Student evaluations had not been
collected according to CAFE. but
there was no indication that they

Stony Brook SA Owes

by Mike Pearlman

The SUNY Stony Brook
adntinistration has requested
payment ofa $25,000 phone bill run
up by Polity. the Stony Brook
student association. The bill. which
is due today. covers telephone
service received by Polity and its
affiliated organizations overthe past
three years.

The two organizations hit hardest
by the action are Statesman. the
Stonybrook newspaper. and WUSB.
the student radio station. The two
groups owe approximately $9000
and $8000. respectively.

According to Polity Executive
Director Bill Camarda. the normal
procedure has been for the university
to pay the telephone bills and be
reimbursed later by the different
student organizations. He said that
many of the student organizations

have been operating on credit and
that the administration decided to
collect all the accounts at once.
Camarda said the student
government itself is paying
approximately $5000 in phone bills.
He also said that many of the
remaining charges are billed to
groups that no longer exist. or are
the result of third-party calls to
Polity‘s extension number.
Although Long Island‘s local
newspaper Newsday. reported last
week that phone service might be
suspended the warnings will not
matcrialile according to Camarda.
"We‘ve been working closely with
the university and they‘re not
shutting off phone service at the end
of the month." he said. “We'redoing
everything we can to cooperate."
Director of Telecommunications
at Stony Brook Tina Dimaggio said

Ex Comp Lit Prof Granted Tenure Hearing

Former SUNYA Comparative
Literature Professor Judith
Leibowitz has been granted a
hearing before the State Division of
Human Rights to present her charge
of sex discrimination at SUNYA.
Division Hearing Examiner
Norman Mcdnick has scheduled her
case for either March 22 or 23.

The Leibowitl case was
postponed Jan.24. when the legal
counsel for SUNY questioned the
Division's jurisdiction. Leibowitz is
charging that she was denied tenure

in I975 because she is a woman.
SUNY Counsel Thomas Santoro
had contended that since Leibowitz
also has court actions penrlingon the
questions surrounding her tenure
case. the Division couldn't consider
her charges. According to Santoro.
under State law no person may bring
charges before the Human Rights
Division if they are involved in court
actions dealing with the same events.
Leibowitz and her lawyer.
Margarethe Powers have argued
that the two proceedings are based

on separate complaints. They
contend that the court actions deal
with the charge that she was
arbitrarily and capricioust
dismissed from herjob. and that the
hearing before the Human Rights
Division is concerned with charges
of sex discrimination in herdenial of
tenure and in working conditions at
SUNYA.

Mcdnick ruled that the Division
does have jurisdiction. In a letter on
February l6. Mcdnick stated that
"...it is my ruling that the Article 78

action brought by the complainant
does not bar a hearing on the
complaint which she thereafter ﬁled
with the Division of Human Rights."
Mcdnick will convene the hearing
in Albany at the Alfred E. Smith
building. After hearing the
arguments of both Leibowitz and
SUNY Counsel Santoro. he will
submit a recommendation to one of
three Division Commissioners. The
Commissioner then makes a
decision on the case.

Boomsliter was Chair of the
Department from I969 to I973. and
Ross followed him. ﬁrst as acting
Chair for a year. until she was

negotiating with Polity over
payment of the bill. “I will approach
the Vice President of Finance and
Business here with a proposal for the

and the balance out of a debt

possible that there would be some
disruptions in telephone service, but
it won‘t be cut off completely.“

Statesman Managing Editor Jack
Millrod said be blamed the
administration for “acting in an ‘all

partially. because of past editors
who didn‘t have the foresight to pay
the bills earlier."

already serious ﬁnancial problems,
and has contributed to the
