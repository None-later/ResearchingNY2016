Points‘Lea‘ds

by Paul sellout: .

To say that Saturday‘s varsit
basketball game was important is an
understatement. A victory over
Utica was essential to keep Albany's
post-season tournament hopes alive.
and the Danes met the challenge
with an 80-76 victory at the
University gym.

Both teams came out with fast
paced offenses. but it was Albany
that established a quick lead.
Winston Royal had the early hot
hand for the Danes. scoringsix of his
team's ﬁrst eight points on a tip in
and two smooth jump shots.

With the score knotted at ten.
Carmelo Verdejo put ina short
jumper. and Albany had the lead.
one which they would never
relinquish. Excellent pressure
defense was a key to the Danes'
success. and it was the big men that
were particularly effective in
containing Gordon Taylor. Utica‘s
6'5” high scoring center.

Taylor managed to break loose for
I4 ﬁrst half points. but with Barry
Cavanaugh stationed in front of him
and Verdejo helping out from
behind. none ofTaylor‘s points came
easy.

After a Kevin Keane basket
increased Albany‘s lead to 30-22. the
Danes became a bit complacent, and
Utica took full advantage. Led by
Taylor and forward Dan Tallman.
the Pioneers narrowed the lead to
two points at 34-32. and caused
Albany coach Dick‘Saucrs to call a
time out.

The regroupcd Danes then
finished up strong. aided by two
Buddy Wleklinski hoops. Wleklinski
hit a long outside shot. then followed

The Albany State men's swim
team concluded its regular season
Saturday with a win over St.
Michael's. 79-32. This upped their
win—loss record to l0-2. its best ever.

Starting the meet off on the right
foot. the ZOO-yard medley relay team
of Mike Dwyer. Joe Shore. Ed
Watkins. and Stefan Stroms
triumphed in l:49.0.

For a change of pace. many events
in this meet had their distances
changed. Instead of the usual l000-
yard freestyle. a l650~yard freestyle
was held. Coming in second place for
Albany was Mitchell Chaitin.
swimming the event for the first
time. Chaitin also copped the 500
yard freester in 6: l6.li4. his personal
best.

The next event was the ZOO-yard
freestyle. St. Michael‘s won it. but
Albany's depth showed through as
Mike Kasabian and Scott
Lonesberry took second and third.
respectively.

Bob Gonzenbach. a triple winner
in the nteet. won the 50’yard
freestyle and the IOU-yard butterﬂy.
Gonzcnbacb has qualiﬁed for the
200yurd butterfly in the national:
and will see if he can qualify for the
iOO-yrtrd butterﬂy in this week’s
SUNYAC championships.

To 80—76 Win

pass from Royal to give Albany is 44-

36 lead at intermission.

For the first half, Albany shot
better than 50 percent with Verdejo
leading the way. tallying l6 points.
Royal was next in line for the Danes
with eight. Tallman was the second
leading scorer for the Pioneers

behind Taylor, chalking up i0 first
half points.

With victory in sight, the Danes
came out on ﬁre in the second half.
Scoring eight of the first ten points.
Albany led 52-38 for their largest
lead of the ballgame.

Cavanaugh led the charge with a
steal and two inside baskets. On
defense. it was Wleklinski who stood
out. sacriﬁcing his body by drawing
three offensive fouls.

Playing such aggressive defense.
the Danes found themselves in foul
trouble. Both Cavanaugh and
Verdejo ended the game with four
fouls. and Keane eventually fouled
out late in the contest.

As a result of the foul problems.
Albany was forced to abandon their
man-to-man defense and switched to
a zone. This move bencfitted Utica
and they began to mount a
comeback. Particularly effective was
Tallman. who scored 15 of his team-

high 25 points in the second haifover-

the zone defense.

“I didn’t want to switch to the
zone.“ commented Sauers. “Our
man-to-man was doing very well.
but I had to protectour big men who
had fouls.“

With seven minutes remaining.
Albany was comfortably in front 7i-
59. At least it appeared the lead was
comfortable. Utica also had visions
of making a tournament. and they
were not about to roll over for

Albany. The Pioneers ran offan li-l
scoring spurt. and suddenly it was
72-70.

Down the stretch of a close
ballgame is not a favorite position
for Albany to be in. The Danes have
lost many games this season in the
last two minutes. and now this
crucial game was slipping away.

With the playoffs staringthcm in
the face. the Danes began their final
push. With |:IS remaining.
Cavannugh hit a lay up. At the 39-

tough ten-foot bank shot. Then with

event. touching out Redmourtd of
St. Michael's for second place.

Assessing his team's fifth-place
finish in Saturday's Ri’l
Invitational. Albany State indoor
track and ﬁeld coach Robert
Munsey was satisﬁed  to an extent.
"It was not too bad. considering
everything that happened."

What happened could be found on
a medical chart. The Danes have
been at less than full strength for the
last three weeks due to illnesses. and
Saturday was no different.

Two valuable middle
distancamen. Mark Dalton and
Sean Reilly. were unabletorun due to
colds. which hurt the Danes in those

distances. “For the first time in our
history we didn't enter anyone in the
mile.“ said Munsey.

might have gotten another ten or l2
points if we had our full team." said
Munscy of his squad's 37-point total.

tremendous upset. The relay ofSteve

The long wait is over. WCDB will
begin broadcasting at 4 p.m. today.

The installation of telephone lines
between the station‘s studios in the
Campus Center and the transmitter
in Mohawk Tower was completed
vestcrday. but members of the
station continued working until
early this morning in order to correct
a weak sigmtl which was broadcast
last night in a frequency response
test.

“The original level ol the response
was low." said WCDB ('hrcl

for all ofthe individuals who worked
so hard to get their voices on the air."
said Rosenthal. "Ilut we’ll quickly go
irtto our regular broadcasting
schedule."

WCDB plans to broadcast 24
hours a day and will lealurc an
extensive programming schedule.
'I he musical format will be "album
oriented rock". according to
Program Director Rich Schcnkmart.
“'l'hat translates into practical
usage." said Sclterrkmtrn. "We‘ll be
playing albums of familiar artists as
well as expanding to new people
such as Elvis Costello and
Meatloaf."

There will also be a number ()ijill/
shows each week. according to
Sclrcnkman. “i feel that this will be

an important thing to the whole
area.“

Rosenthal said that there will be
an effort on the part of the station to
program many hours ofjazz. “There
are no rcgularjau. programs in this
area. Albany traditionally has been a
fairly major center for jaz/
musicians.“

Other musical programming will
include a “Live Concert" show which
will present local musicians
pcrlorrning live in the studios each
week and a show called "Front Row
Center". which will fcatrrrc
recordings of recent local Ctitlccl'ls.

Specier programs will include a
show called “Radio Free Albany".
which will he a comedyrcall-m talk

Rosenthal said that the WCDB

Rosenthal said that WCDB will
also feature editorial commentary by
members of the stations as well as
non—station members. "We will
invite participation. If there is a
specific issue at question. we would
like to make ourselves available as a
forum of debate.“

For members of the station. the
debut broadcast today will be the
culmination of years of work which
were hampered by what seemed to be
a never-ending array of problems.

u’l here hasn‘t been one step along
the way in which at least one thing
didm't go wrong." said Rosenthal.
“Nothing went without a hitch."

“There are dozens of former
station managers who worked hard.
btrt never saw an FM station." said
Rosenthal. “Fortunately. those who
arcdircctly responsiblcarc stillinthc
Albany area and will be able to hear
the station.“

Out: of the people Rosenthal
mentioned is liric (ioldstcin.
currently a day announcer tlt
WROW I‘M. (ioldstcin was station
manager last year. when the FCC
granted the strttrori fl building
permit.

"Eric is indiudually r'csponsrblc
for much of the work." said
Rosenthal.

(ioldstein said last night that lie
lelt good that the station was finally
gorrig on the air. btrt sorry that it
took so long.

"WCDB will be a top sounding
station." said (ioldstcin. "The
management rs excellent l’aul
Rosenthal took care ol the
construction Seeing that all of the
plans are executed is really the most
difficult part. He is probably the
most active and competent station
manager that place has had and they
are fortunate to hrrve someone as
imaginative as he to begin
programming."

Goldstein said that the first
serious attempt to go FM was in
I973 when the station submitted an
application to the SUNYA
administration which included a

 

technical study be the station‘s staff.
“Unfortunately. the administration
realiled that it could never go in as is
because it was fraught with errors."

At that point. the radio station
was called WSUA and was piped in
via carrier current. "The problem
was that thc_ people looked at our
own technical people; we're not a
technically oriented school like RI’I
or MIT and have never had a great
mass of engineers.“ said Goldstcin.
"Those people looked at the
problem. and it seemed virtually
insurmountable."

(ioidstcin said thatakey coginthc
progress of going FM was the hiring
of consultant Ed l’erry. who
specializes in getting college radio
stations licensed. and who did the
entire technical part of the
application.

When Goldstein took over the
station. there was a move by Central
Council member Rick Mecklcr to
have WSUA closed down.

“ fire station was pretty old." said
(ioltlstcin. "SA had been hearing
pr‘orrrrscs ol going I‘M since I969
and were gettrrrg tired ol. lite sr/e ol
the budch had decreased. We
r‘crrlr/cd that nobody would srnk
more money into a carrier current
station and that there \vasu linrtc lilc
to AM operations. We had to go

(iorrrg I'M meant iltlHIlg to cope
unit the bureaucratic channels of
SU.\Y and the Federal
t'ornnrrrnications Commissron.

“It took as six months to complete
the ICC applrcatron and to get
engineer studies." said (ioldstcrn. "It
had to be approved by SUNY
Central and because of delays on
their part. it took a full six months
tor the application to get to the FCC.
There was one year."

UtlitiSlcln added that it took the
FCC a full year to approve the
application six months longer
than the usual waiting period. lie
said that the FCC had apparently
made SUNYA's application a test
case for class D edttcational licenses
and it took them time to write a
rationale for granting this license.

During this time. the station was
busy attempting to garner the
necessary space and funds from the

university and SA. Conference room
3l5 became the site for the new
station after a space allocations
committee studied the station‘s
request. SA then put $30,000 on a
budget rider reserved for the
construction of the FM station.
.That amount. however. was not
enough. and in September. the
station had to ask SA for an
additiona Sl7.000 before
construction could begin. After
some debate by SA ofﬁcials the
station was granted the building
funds on Oct. 5. Studio construction
began on Oct. i4 and the transmitter
and antenna were placed in Mohawk
Tower in December. Transmitter
tests were conducted soon after.

At this point. yet another
headache surfaced for WCDB. The
Atmospheric Sciences Research
Center lodged a complaint that the
transmission of radio signals frorn
Mohawk Tower would interfere
with research conducted at the
weather station there.

Ilccausc of this. the station
decided to halt construction of
permanent cables between the studio
and Mohawk Tower. Temporary
telephone lines were installed.
lorcing the station to postpone
broadcasting for another week.

“it‘s upscttrng that i won't have
much of an opportunity to be with
the statron broadcasting." said
Rosenthal. who is a senior.
“Personally. I'm in no positron to
complain. Eric Uoldstcin spent
several years of his life on this
without reaping any ofthe benefits."

“My only hope is that they don't
take a $40000 investment and sit
down a college kid who plays rock
and roll music." siad Goldslein. "For
some reason. that's what every other
local college station has done and it
stinks. However. with the people on
this stuff. I‘m sure that we don't have
to worry about that."
