Even as thousands of potential listeners slept last night, WCDB
engineering staffers worked feverishly to ensure a high-quality audio
signal for today's sign-on.

Testing the lines connecting the station’s Campus Center_studios and
its transmitter continued into the early morning hours until a final
determination was made that the station would in fact begin FM
broadcasting, according to WCDB Chief Engineer Ira Goldstein.

Goldstein said “seVeral minor difficulties” in the lines had yet to be
eliminated when New York Telephone ﬁnished its installation work
yesterday. '

Leased telephone lines are being used by WCDB because of what a
station spokesman called “the likelihood of the Mohawk Tower
transmitter‘s temporary status.” Objections to the transmitter site raised
by the Atmospheric Science Research Center prompted the station
management to discontinue tedious work on their own transmitter line
last week.

Station General Manager Paul Rosenthal said he was “reluctant to
have to wait“ until early this morning before approvingtoday’s sign-on,
but felt that “it was necessary for us to be fully conﬁdent of an adequate
sounding signal before we gave the go-ahead."

Rosenthal noted that certain engineering work would continue
through today in an attempt to further increase the audio quality. “In
any event, there is a full year‘s worth of engineering work that remains
for us.“ Rosénthal stated.

The installation of the transmitter line represented the last step in a
long series of technical tasks required before WCDB was fully ready to
go on the air.

Wiring of the station‘s new studios, not yet complete, has been
underway for the last three weeks. “It's been an around-the—clock job,"
Goldstein noted.

Station engineers agreed last night that, while much work still remains
to bc done. the most vital jobs have been completed.

“ There are dozens of former station
managers who worked hard, but never
saw an FM station,” said ,Rosenthal.
“Fortunately, those who are directly
responsible are still in the Albany area
and will be able to hear the station."

They said it’would never happen in our lifetime. -This afternoon, the
dream of an FM radio station at SUNYA will become a reality as
WCDB finally begins breadcasting. ‘ ' I

This more than a happy occasion for the radio station’s staff.-Today‘s.
broadcast signals the end of acommunications void at SUNYA. WCDB
will bring more to this campus than music, news and sports. It will
provide a vehicle by which this university community of nearly 20,000
can obtain vital information at a moment‘s notice. It will send out
programming produced by SUNYA students not only to this campus,
but to the city at large. It will inform, entertain, and serve both SUNYA
and Albany.

Most importantly, it will be our radio station, specifically tailored to
the needs and likes of SUNYA students. The events it will cover and the
programming planned is for SUNYA; WCDB is certain to have an
impact on the life of the SUNYA student.

Making this dream a reality wasn’t easy. Many times Murphy's Law
(whatever can go wrong, will) seemed to prevail forthe folks working on
the station. There were empty promises, bureaucratic hassles, long
delays in license application processing, funding problems, space
problems, technical problems, building problems, wiring problems —
cvcn problems with an academic department which, at the last minute,
decided it didn’t like the idea of sharing Mohawk tower with WCDB’s
antenna and transmitter.

These problems were all met by the staff of the WCDB with the
highest form of competence and professionalism. When things got
discouraging, they persisted when others would have given up. From the
time the first application for an FM license was submitted to the
SU NYA ad ministration five years ago, to when the first test signalswere
broadcast from the studio at about I a.m. this morning, an incredible
amount of work had been put in by numerous dedicated individuals.

It is this kind of dedication which has resulted in the broadcast debut
this afternoon. It is this kind of dedication which rightfully deserves the
admiration and gratitude of the SUNYA community.

The staff of The Albany Student Press extends its congratulations to
past members of WSUA who formed the FM foundation — although
the dream wasn‘t realized in their time at SUNYA, the fruits of their
efforts can be now obtained by simply turning on the radio. To the
current WCDB staff. congratulations on a job well done and the best of
luck for a successful future.

They said it would never happen in our lifetime. Well, they were
wrong SUNYA‘s got an FM radio station.
