Miller Repert On Tenure Released

by MJ. Memmott

SUNY was not forced by
budgetary constraints to terminate
the 82 tenured faculty it tired frotn
I975 to I976. Instead, uccordingtoa
report released by the Assembly
Higher Education Committee on
Tuesday. SUNY was faced with a
no-growtlt budget which made the
cutting of tenured faculty “largely
\oluntary."

In addition. while dealing with
SUNY retrenchment problems state-
mtle. the report devotes a major
portion of its contents to SUNYA.
[his was caused. the report says,

because “The Albany campus was
the scene of the most retrenchments
in the systemand the subject ofmueh
of the testimony submitted to the
committee.“

The committee dealt with four
retrenched SUNYA departments.
and other charges of abuse at
SUNYA. Thirty-two of the eighty-
two tenured faculty retrencltcd
during those years were from
SUNYA. '

The Higher Education
Committee. chaired by
Assemblyman Melvin ll. Millerll)-
Kings County) published the report

School of Education May

by Steve ()ster

ActingSUNYA President Vincent
()‘l.eary will decide within two
weeks whether to move the School of
liducation or some other academic
group to the downtown campus.
according to Vice President for
Business and Hnance. John
Hartigan.

The move. which Hartigan said
would resolve a “major problem on
this cantpus.“ will create space on the
podium for academic offices now
situated on the upper floors of
Mohawk Tower. Mohttwk Tower is
slated to be converted for student
housing in the fall of I979.

O'Loary‘s Decision

O‘l.eary‘s decision. which will
result in the transfer of at least one
academic group over the summer of
1979. will signal the end of nearly
two years of controversy concerning
the dislocation of uptown ofﬁces.

Dennis Stevens. chair of a special
SUNYA Space Committee.
explained that last March the Balk
Committee. an ad hoc group in-
vestigating the move, submitted a
proposalto former President Emmet
Fields calling for the School of
Edttcation to be moved to Draper
and Richardson Halls on the old
SUNYA campus downtown. Fields
approved this proposal, Stevens
said.

“That committee considered every

by Aron Smith

A proposal outlining curriculum
goal-requirements for all SUNYA
undergraduates was unanimously
approved Monday by members of
Curriculum Committee of the
University Senate's Undergraduate
Academic Council.

The proposal underwent a final
revision Monday. “just changing
words and taking a few things out,“
aceo rding to Curriculum Contmittce
Chair Harold Cannon.

"Goals of a Liberal
Undergraduate Education" is the
title of the report which will be
considered by the UAC's full body
later this month. The eleven-page
document details eight areas of
knowledge which the Curriculum
Committee feels each SUNYA
student sltould be exposed to before
graduation. lt then proposes specific
requirements for the BA and BS
degrees.

The eight curriculum gottl‘
requirements include oral

department for relocation. judging
them all on the same objective
criteria." said Stevens.

Those criteria included the extent
to which faculty would be
dislocated. special services necessary
to each department, which would be
affected by the move and the "fit" of
each department with the space
available on thedowntown campus.

When O‘Leary replaced Fields as
President. however. he decided to re-
open the issue, partially in response
to pressure from the School of
Education. according to Hartigan.

School of Education spokesman
Oliver Nikoloff. said 0‘l.eary
“should be eommeded for his
openness and desire to assure that a
fair decision is made.“

Nikoloff said that the School of
Education faculty is “about 75 per
cent opposed“ to the move
downtown. and that a summary of
the schools defense for staying on the
podium will be presented to thcdcan
and president early next week.

Acting Dealt David Newman of
the School of Criminal Justice said
he would prefer not to move
downtown. but conceded that such a
move would have “some advantages.
and would present no outstanding
problems.“ The School of Criminal
Justice currently resides in the three
and one-half floors of Mohawk and
may be under consideration for
transfer to the downtown campus.

communication. written
communication. use of tools.
breadth of perspective, critical and
analytical methods ol‘inquiry. moral
and ethical judgment. aesthetic
sensibility, and creativity.

According to the proposal. the
new guidelines would require ofeach
student “the successful completion
of a major. at second field or second
major. and a residue of individual
courses which. taken together. have
provided the student with the
opportunity to understand and
intprovc his or her competencies" in
the eight areas.

UAC‘s Curriculum Committee
began formulating its proposal after
rejecting the final report of the
Special Committee to Review the
Undergraduate Experience. in
October. The UAC was originally
charged with reviewing the SCRUE
report by Acting SUNYA President
Vincent O'Leary in September. The
task was subsequently delegated to
the Curriculum Committee, which

 

after holding lengthy hearings on
complaints regarding the
retrenchments in the State
University and City University
systems. The retrenchments were
carried out from I975 to I977
because of what were then described
as budgetary restraints on the State
as a whole.

The committee conducted two
public hearings. the ﬁrst in Albany
on September 23. I977. and the
second on September 30. I977 in
New York City. Testimony gathered
at those hearings. plus
correspondence and stuff research.
makes up the contentsol'the report.

The committee concluded that at
the same time the 82 tenured faculty
were being retrcnchcd ~~ out of
approximately ISO faculty overall ~A
actual funds available to the SUNY
campuses were increased. Funds for
the four university centers alone rose
from approximately $188.5 million
to $217.8 million between I974 and
l977.according to the report.

In addition, the committee
reported that. from information
gathered by the American
Association of United Professors.
the actual number of faculty in the
SUNY system increased during this
period.

The Committee of Concerned
Faculty. a group composed of 200
past and present SUNYA faculty.
criticized S UNY for its retrenchment
practices in a press release issued
Wednesday. “The precedentof ﬁring
tenured faculty for neither financial

or academic reasons cannot be
allowed tostand. . .SUNY is guilty
of dubious practices not tolerated
elsewhere in American higher
education.“ the committee wrote.
ActingSUNYA President Vincent
O‘Lcary. having not seen the report
himself. said he could not comment
on any specific findings the
committee had made. He did.
however. agree to comment on the
SUNYA retrenchments generally.
O‘Leary was a member of the Task
Force on Priorities and Resources.
which gave former SUNYA
President Emmett Fields
recommendations on where cuts

should be made. Those
recommendations were accepted in
total by Fields in March of I976.

“On this campus we lost faculty
positions. There are less faculty
positions now than there were ﬁve or
six years ago," O‘Leary said.

The Higher Education Committee
reported that SUNYA did indeed
pursue mpolicy of “retrenchment
beyond the budgetarin mandated
cuts for the clear purpose of
obtaining resources to maintain
flexibility." The committee -

Housing Shortage Anticipated

by J.M. Reilly

Leasing the old St. Agnes
Boarding School complex in
Loudonville is “one of several
possible options“ being considered
by SUNYA housing officials to
accomodate an expected increase in
demand for on-campus housing for
the Fall of I978, according to Vice
President for llniversity Affairs Lew
Welch.

SUNYA's Residence Office is
expecting "at least 200" more
applications for on—campus housing

found the report to have “little
relationship to the goals and
objectives identified by the members
of the SCRUE committee."

“The SCR U E report only came up
with one proposal. and even that
didn't have the full support of the
SCRUE committee." according to
Richard Collier ofSUNYA's Center
for Undergraduate Education
(formerly University College). “The
Committee simply decided not to
adopt that single proposal."

The SCR UE report divided
SUNYA's undergraduate
curriculum into three "colleges,"
known as the humanities. the social
sciences, and the natural sciences. It
proposed that each student earn “at
least nine credits in each of the two
colleges outside his or her major."

Although the three—college plan
was scrapped. the basic objectives of
the SCRUE report remain intact asa
pa rt of the UAC Curriculum
Committee report.

According to Collier. "the only

 

 

next semester than it can presently
accomodate. according to Dean for
Student Affairs Neil Brown. This
projection was made upon analysis
of past and projected future trend
lines. which in turn are based on
enrollment predictions for the
coming year.

Acting Associate Dean for
Student Affairs John Welly stressed
that leasing the St. Agnes facility is
only “one in a wide number of
alternatives" being considered by
SUNYA administrators for the fall.

Undergraduate Curriculum Proposal Adopted

thing that was thrown out from the
SCRUE report was. for example. to
require a student in the humanities
to take so many courses in the social
sciences and so many courses in
natural sciences. without specifying

which those courses might be."
The SCRUE report appeared
seven years after the proposal ofthe
Committee on Undergraduate
Requirement Elimination was
approved by the University Senate.
The CURE report abolished
SUNYA‘s distribution requirements
to provide a general education,
greater academic freedom. and to
eliminate “the somewhat artiﬁcial
and arbitrary distribution of specific
credit requirements.“ according to
the Curriculum Committees report.
Former SUNYA President
Emmett Fields created SCRUE in
I976 to study University degree
requirements, after the Council on
Educational Policy recommended a
more structured program than had

Neither Welty nor any other
administrator contacted would be
more speciﬁc about other optionl
under consideration. According to
Welly, “we are still exploring
possibilities...we are no where near
pinning anything down yet.”

Welly indicated that some
concrete decisions will have to be
made “within the next four or ﬁve
weeks" in order to assure the
availability of additional housing for
next fall.

Before any of the alternatives
become more deﬁnite, Welly said,
housing officials must wait for
statistics on the number of incoming
freshmen and transfers who want
on-campus housing for next year. as
well as the number of students
currently living on campus who will
be returning in the fall. These
statistics should be available in “a
little over a month." according to
Acting Director of Residences
Henry Kirchner.
