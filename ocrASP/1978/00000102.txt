Schmidt evaluation is the closest to

by Bob Bloscnsteln

Members of the Central Council
Academic Committee delivered a
resolution to Acting SUNYA

President Vincent O’Leary earlier ‘

this week calling for the creation of
an Academic Grievance Committee.
As it is envisioned. according to
Committee Chair David Ruffo. the
committee would hear and
investigate grievances, and direct
studentsvto the proper channels for
following through with their
complaints. According to Ruffo.

 

such a committee is needed because 7

“nobody knows about the prope
grievance channels".
Aspects Unclear g

O‘Leary said yesterday he liked
the idea of the proposal. butthat
some aspects of the proposal were
still unclear. Vice President for
Academic Affairs David Martin
would probably work with the
committee should it actually be
formed. O'Leary said.

The Council is presently trying to
establish a task force whlch would

Grievance  

set up guidelines for the committee V

and also in‘terview‘ prospectitie
members, Ruffo said. » ’
After the guidelines are set, the
proposal will be presented to O'leary
again; Although Ruffo said
O‘Lcary's approval is not necessary
for the establishment of . the
committee. he said the committee
would not be effective without the

' backing of thesadministration.

RulTo said he hopes the grievance
committee can be operating as early
as the end of this semester.

WCDB Signs On The FM Airwaves From New Studio

continued from page three
Goldstein in turn praised Roscnthal.
who praised Roscnthal again, and so
on.

The praise was warranted: each
person had been a vital factor in
achieving an FM. station here. The
usually serious looking Eric
Goldstcin grinned widely as he
happily told everyone. “I can‘t wait
to listen to the station on myFM car
radio."

After the opening remarks.
Roscnthal told everyone that it was
time to begin WCDB‘S regular
progamming and turned the
microphone over to disc jockey Jim
Salurno.

Saturno put on Bruce
Springsteen's “Born to Run" and
WCDB was on its way.

Lutcr. Roscnthal was asked
whether the sign on was a huge relief
for him.

"It doesn‘t really feel like I have a
monkey off my back." he said.
"Maybe it will feel that way when I
go home. lie down and listen to the
station on my stereo."

That luxury would have to wait.
however. The problems of trying to
build an FM station were quickly

transformed into the problems of
running an FM station. The original
signal sent out by WCDB Was not a
very good one and that had to be
cleared up. Roscnthal said that the
problem was “somewhere between
the transmitter and the antenna."
Educational Communications
Center engineers and WCDB
engineers worked on the problem.

At 3 pm. the scheduled broadcast
of the Grsat Dunes asketball game
was interrupted because of problems
with telephone lines between the
studios and the gym. Rosenthal
returned to the studios to discuss the
Danes game over the air while the
technical problems were cleared up.

The airing of the comedy show
"Radio Free Albany“ drew some
criticism from factions who were
offended by some of the remarks
made during a skit.

Roscnthal would have to confront
this problem as he came into the
studios the following day. The time
he came inqu 5:30 u.m., in order to
produce the morning newscast.

There will he more problems. and
as expected. the station won't be able
to please everyone. In fact. minutes
after the Springsteen song was aired.

an irate listener called and said that if
this was any indication of what the

Housing Shortage Anticipated .

continued from page one

The St. Agnes facility was
considered by SUNYA housing last
spring as a possibility for housing
students for Fall ‘77. according to
Welly. A deal was eventually worked
out with the Country Squire Motel
in Guilderland for the housing of
more than sixty students. Numerous
problems resulted from this
arrangement, and there are no
students currently housed at the
Motel.

Dean Brown said the Country
Squire was not under consideration
for housing any of the expected
overﬂow of students for next Fall.

A spokesperson for the Episcopal
Diocese. which currently owns the
St. Agnes complex, said the tentative
plan is for the Diocese to sell the
property and buildings of the St.
Agnes School to an Albany'
developer, who would then lease the
facility to SUNYA. The
spokesperson said the current
negotiations on the property were
“very tentative," and would not
name thcdcvcloper being consulted.

The I St. Agnes School itself
consists of two structurcs. a
dormitory with space for
approximately fifty people. and a
second building housing classrooms,
a gym. and a cafeteria. If the
University decides to lease the
complex. the larger building would
require extensive renovation to
provide additional living space.

one solution the Committee offered.
This would provide a “more

committee.

Finally. the committee pidposes the
establishment of guidelines for

retrenchment questions onto a
collective bargaining table; the
creation of provisions for the
rehiring of retrenchcd tenured
professors; the establishment of a
requirement that both SUNY and
