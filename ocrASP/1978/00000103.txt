-  Newspaperi reporter I Debbie

Smith on Saanuan Island says that ,

several persons claim to have sighted
the unusual craft at almost exactly
6:30 in the mornings and6:30 in the
evevnings every day since late last
year. '

One elderly witness is quoted by
Smith as describing the object as
looking like. in his words, “a ﬂying
chicken .brooder," a chicken
brooder. in case you're not familiar
.with one, is a dome-shaped structure
encirled by windows.

Reporter Smith says that during
one particular sighting, an entire
roomful of people at a resort on San
Juan Island claimed to have seen the
ﬂying craft.

In another instance. Smith says. a
laser beam expert who resides on the
island reported that his entire house
was suddenly illuminated inside by
an intense white light at 2:30 in the
morning, almost immediately after
he had concluded experiments with
his own small laser device.

Both the Navy and the Air Force
have stated that there havc been no
military manucvers in the vicinity of
San Juan Island which might
explain what people claim they are
seeing.

COME TO PAPA

Babies who are pampered in their
first year of life are more confident
and independent children.

This is according to a University
of Virginia psychologist Dr. Mary
Ainsworth. . who says that she
studied babies in a variety of
laboratory situations.

The babies who were most
“secure.“ Ainsworth says, had
received close attention in their Iirst
few months of life and could count
on their mother to be there for
feeding. tenderness. affection. and
close bodily contact.

says, were willing to explore an

unfamiliar environment when left
alone, and were eager to come back
to their mothers when they were
returned. '

Ainsworth said that about one“

third of the infants she 'studied.
however. were anxious. Such
anxious children. she said.
commonly had mothers who
avoided close body contact with
them. These children. when left

alone, reportedly cried more often

and when returned to their mothers,
seemed to avoid the mothers or
ignore them entirely.

WEED KILLER

Researchers with the
government‘s National Institute on
Drug Abuse are now reporting that
at least 20 percent of the samples of
marijuana recently seized near the
US-Mexican border have been
contaminated by the deadly
herbicide “paraquat.”

Dr. Richard Hawks says the
government's latest tests indicate
that to of the 49 samples seized and
tested since October contained
measurable residues of the toxic
hericide.

Prior to this development. the
government was reporting that less
than |0 percent of the weed being
tested seemed to be contaminated by
the poison.

SPEAK EASY

A series of studies by sociologists

has found that men. and not women. '

may be the ones who talk too much.

The Chicago Daily News quotes a
Northern Illinois University study as
ﬁnding that women talk less than
men. and that women get much less
of a chance to speak when men are
present.

Another study of male-female
conversations recorded in coffee
shops. drugstores. and private
homes in Santa Barbara. Californa.
was conducted by professors
Candice West and Don
Zimmerman. The two researchers
found that in conversations studied,
“46 out of 48 interruptions were
made by males to females."

Said the two. “in every
conversation. the male interrupted
the female more frequently than vice

vcrsa.“ The professors added that'

females showed a greater tendency
towards silence,"especially. . . after
the men had interrupted them.“

TELL THE TRUTH

Lying through your teeth. at least
over the telephone. may not be so
easy anymore.

That's because on the other end of
the line, a hagoth may be Iistcningto
you.

A hagoth isn‘t a type of weird
interplanetary space being. Instead.
it is a new voice stress analyrer which
rr-portcdly can tell the party Iistenir g
to you immediately ifyou‘rc telling a
lie.

The hagoth looks like a portable
tape recorder except for eight green
lights and eight red lights. The eight
green lights light up if you are
perfectly calm and normal. and are
telling the truth. However. if you are
lying and your body begins
exhibiting stress as a result, the
hagoth's red lights begin lighting up.
