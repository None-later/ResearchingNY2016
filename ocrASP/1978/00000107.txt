“lien-tile loy"
Asylum aE~Illl
Warren Zevon

 

By DENNIS SCHEYER

as not mince words; Warren

Zevon certainly doesn‘t. I

don't believe in hyping

albums. But before I tell you

about the songs on this
album. let me tell you that in my opinion
Warren Zevon is one of the best singer-
songwriters to come down the pike in a
long time.

His last album featured the incredible
Muhammads Radio. My copy~ is worn
out into oblivion. but I still play it. This is
going to happen to his latest [irritable
Boy too. '

His musical presentation is slick. at
times'like the best Jackson Browne (he
produced the album); but Zevon rocks.
" Lawyers Guns and Money" tells of the
time Zevon went home for the night with
a waitress. and discovers she is a Russian
spy. “Werewolfs of London“ speaks of a
“werewolf with a Chinese menu irrliis
hand.” He somehow lands up “drinkinga
pina colada at Trader Vim." This is the
stuff that drug dreams are made of.

The musicianship itself is ﬁrst-rate. The
band consists ofWaddy Wachtel, who is a
veritable genious on the guitar, Zevon on
piano. Leland Sklar on bass. Russel
Kunkel on drums. and Danny Kortchmar
on percussion.

This however is just the beginning.
Also. on the album are; (in order of
appearance) Jim Horn. Linda Ronstadt,
Jennifer Worries. John McVic. Mick
Fleetwood. Karla Bonoff. Kenny
Edwards, and Jackson has some
harmonics in there under the guise ofthe
Gentleman Boys. which also features
Jorge Calderon. and John David
Souther.

I understand that Zevon is alsotops in
live performance which he will be doing
tonight at Page Htill. If he is anywhere
close to this album. it will he the best.

[irritable Boy fills a gap that we have
had in the rock music biz since I975 and
“Born to Run." I‘m glad to see it filled.
Get the albumll! (Remember it‘s only
hype when you're pushing something you
don‘t believe in!)

"The Mvorituroo ot mm Pirates"
tile/urn OE-IZI
Lonny Whlto

By JON BRESSNER

inoe Lenny White departed

from Return To Forever last

year, the trend encompassing

his music has been along the

lines of funky progressive
rock. While The Adventures of Astral
Pirates is no aberration this album
represents his best work since he left that
band.

At first glance the album looks
extremely imaginative. the cover artwork
could definitely be used for a poster. l‘hc
inside of the cover tells the story of the
intergalactic battle between the Astral
Pirates. Manadrin warlords and Fornax
during the fifth millennium. a time when
music had gone from the cosmos. The
musical space odyssey starts with a side of
"Pursuit" and closes with a side of

"Encounter" where finally the Astrali

Pirates retrieve the celestial music the
cosmos has not known for centuries.

However. the music on the album is not
quite as creative as the cover. most of it
being very reminiscent of tthig City
album with the best parts bearing
'resemblance to the music of Return to
Forever. Playing with White is Don
Blackman on keyboards. Alex Blake on
bass, Jeff Sigman on rhythm guitar and
Nick Moroch on lead guitar. While these
people are all fine musicians. their
ctiilibar doesn‘t force White to achieve the
potential he is capable of as a drummer.
White is it very talented drummer though
unfortunately is less gifted as it composer.

The A tlventurcs af/tslral Pirates is not
it bad album and will undotibtably receive
some FM airplay btit contains nothing
(though there is a noteworthy 30 second
straight ahead jazz tune) which I feel
makes the album particularly
outstanding. The effort on the bands part
is commendable its the musicianship is
good throughout and though this album
will surely be praised by old Lenny White
hills. I personally don't feel it will gain
him many new ones.

Con Rock
Coffee Hoooo

 

By JERRY MIKORENDA
fyou’re tired of parking on
Lark Street to get into
Bogarts. where you wait for
the band to blow a fusejust so
you can m'umble a few words

into, a friend's car; or if you get

embarrassed by people knowing you‘ve
been to the Rat on Friday night because
your hand stamp hasn‘t washed off by

Saturday afternoon. then you owe it to

yourself to try an alternative experience
the Sun Rock Coffee House. on

Central and Quail.

Just two blocks over from the bus stop
coming from uptown. and three blocks
over coming from Western Ave.. the Sun
Rock Coffee House is located next to
Mcndel‘s Pub. and is owned by Jean
Mendel. On the outside the coffee house
isn‘t impressive. but then again it isn‘t
impressive on tlic inside cithcr. which is
just the point.

Inside the walls are a plain white stucco
with dark wood paticling that comes to
about shoulder height when you sit down.
A small place. tthun Rock makes tip for
its lack of size with it friendly.
'coinfortahle atmosphcrc, While it is small
it's not eratnpcd. and you won‘t get hit in
the head with the ladies‘ room door when
walking out. 'I he sheer orange curtains
that cover the front window give the rootn
a soft vanilla glow from the hard white
neon shadows outside. Overall the Sun
Rock is the kind of place you would
expect Tom Waits to walk in. pull tip a
chair. and start singing.

There are no ltish red table cloths.

to get in the Sun Rock just tables.
chairs. candles. a wall with a mountain
mural paititcd on it. and of course. the
thing most people came to hear the
music. The Sun Rock opened in January
with the idea that it would promote local
folk music and musicians. On Wednesday
nights it “song swap“ is run where pcoplc
who want to play can sign tip and play.
Although you might not hear the best
quality of music. Wednesday nights can
prove to be the wildest night ofthe week.
with such local hits as “Laundromat
Blues" sung to the tuncofpiitrons piittiitg
in and taking money from the donation
jar. Aitd it is not unlikely for someone
from the audience to jump on stage and
grab a mike in the middle of it song.

The rest of the wcckcnd is quieter.
however. with regular folk entertainment
Thursday through Saturday nights. along
with' it cover charge that the management
has promised to keep its low as possible.
Sunday night is classical night with
classical music played by it group of three
or four musicians. The Sun Rock is open
Wednesday through Sunday it p.m. to 2
am.

If you're interested in local folk music.
don‘t like standing in front of Wiilt Siib‘s
waiting for twenty-three more people to
file out of Bogart's, or just get restless

Wino & Choc-o

By SANDY ROBINSON
inc and cheese. live music. and
candlelight provided the
elegant atmosphere of this
weekend's “Mousetrap.” The
new on-campus wine and

cheese place opened Friday night. The
function is different from any already
existing at SUNYA. but from the number
of students who attended and those that
waited outside the door. its future
popularity looks promising.

The atmosphere of the dining room
was rich in color. Bold red tablecloths
were warmed by the red table lanterns.
whilc dim yellow lights shone above. To
the left was the bar window where the
waiters gathered their wine bottles and
crystal glasses. At the center. was astagc
set up with microphones and speakers.
also draped with red cloth. Several
waiters shuffled buck and forth. each
authentically dressed in bow tie. short
white jacket. and dark pants. They
walked around. gathering orders from the
groups of sciitcd students. The aura inthc
dining room was nothing short of
ltixuiious.

lhc dccortilirc mcnti placed tit each
table provided a list of wines offered. as
well as ii dcsci iptiou ol the cheeses served.
lhc red. white. rose. and sangriu wines
were served by both the bottle and the
half-bottle. lhc cheeses were served
either as a combination platter or
individually. (‘hccses from France.
Norway. Italy. and Holland
supplemented the domestic types. and all
were served with chilled litiit slivers and
round crackers. Artistic arrangement of
thc delicacies gave character to the frugal
quantities. In addition. individual pots of
coffee. tea. hot cider. and cocoa were
served.

llic music was providctl by the group.
“Second Stage." featuring Mikc limcrson
and llrticc ('ohcii. anti it couldn‘t have
been a liner choice to complete that
classic atmosphere. The two harmonized
beautifully on their twelve-string guitars.
both instrumentally and vocally. Their
numbers included selections from Dan
l-ogclbcrg. Seals and Crolts. Cat Stevens.
l he llcaitlcs and others. "Summer Breeze“
by Seals and ('rolts was exceptionally
well done by both. the guitar strumming
was still and clear. while limcrson's
smooth yoicc sung the verses. At the
chorus. Cohen's crisp and slightly higher
\‘oicc provided distinct harmony.

lhc music maintained its place in the
background. ncycr competing with the
ongoing comcrsiitioiis of the audience. It
could have been slightly louder. however.
so as to filter the area in back.

As seats were filled. floor space was
used for seating. The rooiii Wits packed.
Some of the grotips were deep in
conversation and wine tasting. while
others toward the front gazed intently at
the musicians. The “Mousetrap” was set
and the response was clear. 'l‘hosc inside
the room. remained. Matty more were
drawn and waited impatiently otitside.
The attention was caught. and from
observation. it looks like it will be well

 

maintained. J
