England. l-lis style, reflects characteristics of
his movement,.the forerunner of American
punk, such as a return to brash, amateurish
cssentiality of rock and roll originals, a blunt,
irectional charge with apparently little
ubtlcty. and “a simple unabashed fervor in
conveying a direct message with no deep,
insightful lyrics. Costello‘s "lack of stage
presence“ is a rebellion against the overactive.
overly matured state of rock. The lack thereof
becomes the attainment of the same.

If one walks into the punk rock capital of
New‘York City. CBGB' . the first thing one
notices (beside the sleazy atmosphere and
cxotically dressed patrons) is the incredible
volume of the music. Shcycr's condemnation
of this aspect of Costello‘s music shows his
ignorance of punk style. Moving further into
the bar/club. one has a choice of either
pushing her way to front to stand on chairs
with everyone else and clap. scream. and just
rock and roll with the music orjusl stay in the
buck and try to see over the crowd. Ncw anc
nrti. s are accustomed to similar treatment in
English clubs. The audience at Page Hull acted

as it they were listening to a Bach concerto

instcod of Elvis Costello. thn he finally

ycllcd. "What the hell‘s wrong with you? Don‘t

you people have Icgs'.’". after several requests

lot the audience to appreciate hint. cvcryonc

stood. but immediately sat down again at the

Agency’s Greyhound U niversity Discount? and
all around campus. I v I _ N p

The problem is that nobody knows for sure who is running the
operation. When one looks at the facts, the operation looks pretty
shady. First of all, it says that the buses will leave from thc'“Student
Union". We have nothing called a Student Union. Secondly, whomever
set this thing up neglected to apply for a solicitations permit through SA;
That means that they are not legally allowed toload a bus on campus.

The Greyhound‘Bus Co. in Albany says that they have not heard of
the company and that the company has not chartered a bus from them.
A spokesman of the company says that the company cannot locate the
person the ad directs the check to be made out to. The spokesman also
would not deny that this could be a fraud. ' ' '

While it can’t be proven conclusively at this point that this is a fraud.
the facts don‘t paint a pretty picture.

So when you see those signs, ignore them. They might steer you the
wrong way: out seventeen bucks and stuck in Albany. .

No More Country Squires

With the expected increase in student demand for on-campus housing
next year, it is essential that the Residence Office avoid another
catastrophe like the decision to house students at the-Country Squire

Once again, the SU NYA dormitories will not be able to accomodatc
all of those wishing to live on-campus. Hence, the Residence Ofﬁce is
currently surveying alternative housing possibilities. It is strongly urged
that the alternative sites be looked over with a fine-tooth comb.

One important change since the Country Squire is the line of thinking
concerning students housed by the university in locating other than the
five dorms. The students at the Country Squire were considered off-
campus students.

They should have been accorded the benefits of on-campus students.
It is not their fault that the university could: notﬂnd'enough space from
them »-- the university has an obligation to provide acceptable housing.

This obligation includes transportation to the academic podium— to
be provided on a regular basis by the university, unlike the Country
Squire case. Student representation in the negotiations is vital to ensure
that the students will be given a better deal next year. ln any event, let’s
hope that the Country Squire problems have taught the administration a
lesson that they will heed.
