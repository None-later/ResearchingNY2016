familiar hitch of the britches and a
flash V 'off‘the . famous. grin, Arnold
Palmer quick-stepped out of the past
with a solid. 7-under-par 65 and a
share of the ﬁrst-round lead
Thursday in the $200,000 Florida
Citrus Open Golf Tournament.

There have been other good scores
in the ﬁve ling years since Palmer
scored the last of his 61 American
tour triumphs, but there wasa major
difference this mild. cloudy day-
there was no scrambling in this. his
best effort in years.

“In recent years I've had some
good rounds that I haven't been
happy with; I’ve had good scores but

. I wasn't happy with the way I was
hitting the ball, the way the shots
were coming off the club." said the
dynamic man who ranks as the most
popular player the game has ever
produced.

It was a clear implication he was
enormously pleased and satisﬁed
that. at last, he had recaptured some
of the flair and form that made him
the idol of the world‘s golﬁng
millions a decade back. '
