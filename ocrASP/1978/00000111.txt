For'Verdejo andCisvanaugh to be
playing at the same time is
something new this year to the
Danes. Last season, it would be a
rare occasion when Sauers would
have them in simultaneously. In
Albany‘s most satisfying triumph of
the season, the combination worked
to perfection.

In addition to Cavanaugh‘s high-
scoring output..Verdejo chipped in
with 25 points. 16 coming in the
second half. Both junior postmen
teamed for a meaty 32 of Albany‘s 53
second-half points. as well as l5 of
Albany‘s 31 rebounds. Hamilton
also garnered 3| bounds.

“I think we're both strong down
low,“ said Verdejo. the torn-down
winning nets separating the two big
men in the victorious locker room.
"Just now we‘re starting to jell."
explained Cavanuagh. “He
(Verdejo) really played well
tonight."

Hamilton‘s Billy Southworth.
who netted 16 points overall. scored
on a backdoor play to knot the score
at 65 with 8:25 left. Twenty seconds

The latter weaved through the

Hamilton defenders for the easy-

hoop. securing an Albany lead which
they never would lose.

Behind 75-72 with 4:35 remaining,
Hamilton called a timeout. They
were desperate to cut into Albany‘s
slight but consistent margin. The
Continental‘s coaching staff decided
to full-court press the Danes. but this

'strategic move backﬁred.

As Hamilton double-teamed.
Albany broke the press without too
much trouble. In addition. the
Danes were able to slip their way
through the opposing defense for
several backdoor baskets.

In the next two minutes. Albany
outscored the Continentals seven to

that was all they needed.

on a fast break, converted a three-

Even the second-ranked- team in

said Sauers. "Even though they had
49 points combined." The Danes
tried to prevent the two from getting
the hall where they wanted it most.
according to Sauers.

Keane was happy to see his last
home game a success. “Being my last
game it was really nice." he said. "I
can't ask for anything else."

“I think we were all up for the

and Cobleskill (oz-m. the jayvees
raised their incredible mark to l6-2.
A split of their list two games with
RPI and Cornell will tie them for the
record.

Saturday night at Cobleskill, the
Pups faced a team that had won only
four of its 22 games played. The
Pops might have went in a little too
conﬁdent. but Albany coach Bob
Lewis didn't take Cobleskill as
lightly as his team.

“I expected a tough game from
them and we got one. Those guys
always battle up there. and we had a
big letdown after the Union game."

After taking a quick ten-point
lead. Albany fell apart. The defense
disappeared and the turnovers
mounted. while the Cobleskill
shooters were hitting everything the
threw up. ‘

Using a zone defense that gave
Albany fits, Cobleskill took a ten-
point lead and stayed in front most
of the way. They were up by 12 with
six minutes to play when Lewis made
a slight offensive adjustment.

Bittker and McGraw started
positioning themselves on the same
side of the basket. with McGraw

This strategy helped hiring»

outscore their opponents by to
points over the remaining minutes to
give them their winning margin.
Over those last six minutes. the
defense and reboundingpicked up as
well. as the whole team seemed to get
a lift from the MeGraw-Bittker
combo.

“Those guys really carried the'

team offensively.” remarked Lewis.
“But the whole team got tough
defensiver over the last part of the
game.”

Friday night‘s game at Union was
expected to be a close contest and it
was for most of the ﬁrst half. Albany
took a 40-34 lead at halftime.
although neither team had played up
to par.

In the second half, the Pups
started taking control. In a total
team eITort. the jayvees blew Union
right out of the gym.

“We probably played as good a
half as we've played all year,"
commented Lewis. “I don‘t feel we
could play any better basketball than
we did in that half."

John Battle. starting his ﬁrst game
in place of Marty McGraw. led
Albany with a season-high 16 points.
Most of those points were well-
carned, as the quick little guard
repeatedly stole the ball and forced
turnovers.

Lee Gardner and Bittker each had
l4 points. while Steve Low rounded
out the scoring with 12. Low played
a strong game off the boards its well.
pulling in 12 rebounds.

Albany‘s defensive game was very
strong in the second half. Union
couldn't get their offense in gear. as
the Pops outrebounded. outshot.
and outplayed their counterparts.

One of the defensive stars was Erv
Roberson. who held Union's leading
scorer to an insigniﬁcant 15 points.
“It was really a good team effort.“
said Lewis. “Even the guys who went
in there later on did a good job."

the Pups traveled to RPI last
night. and they ﬁnish up their season
tomorrow night in Cornell.
