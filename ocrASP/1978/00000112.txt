Emotional Crowd Enjoys Shocker

by Richie Mermelsteln

Emotion.

There are tales of it causing strange
occurrences, of it turning an
ordinary event into a special one. an
unexceptional player into an all—star.
a feeble person into a dynamo.
Webster's calls it “a psychic and
physical reaction subjectively
experienced as strong feeling. and
physiologically experienced through
changes that prepare the body for
immediate vigorous action.“

Wednesday night. the Great
Danes showed they know how to
emote. There was a feeling similarto
that of the ﬁnal Albany-Siena game.
when so much emotion flowed that
had the team been unable to score
against Siena. the fans certainly
could have.Wednesday night. the
team. the Pep Band. and the ISM
faithfuls came to play.

Albany had just been denied a
spot in the Division lll playoffs. The
opposition. Hamilton. had won their
last 2i games in a row. and was
considered the second best Division
III team in the country. Theelements
were there for a high-ﬂying
Hamilton team to quietly defeat a
disappointed Albany squad.

But. the Danes realized. the
elements were also there for an upset
that would gain wide attention. a
citance to show the NCAA where to
stick their bids. It was to be their
ﬁnal game of the year at home and
Captain Kevin Keane‘s ﬁnal home
game ever. Additionally it was to be
against a team that each year
mistakenly leaves its playbook in
llarry Cavanaugh‘s hip pocket. The
ingredients for an emotional recipe
were present.

Through the ﬁrst couple of
minutes. Albany trailed. The noise in
University Gym. though. would not
have offered a clue as to the score.
Winston Royal. the ﬁrst Dane
Player who absorbed the crowd‘s
emotionality, ran amouck. He hit a
twenty footer. stole the ball. sank a
driving layup. picked up an offensive
rebound which he fed to Cavanaugh
for an easy bucket, stole the. ball
again and assisted Buddy
Wleklinski. before popping in
another outside shot.

Cavanaugh caught the fever next.
sinking four baskets in the next four
minutes. Hamilton coach Tom
Murphy cupped his chin in his
hands. unable to believe that his
number two ranked team was
suddenly losing 20-l2.

The Hamilton recipe. which called
for a mixture of incredible 25-foot
shooting by All-American John
Klauberg and a ﬁrm belicfthatgivcn
enough time. the referees will bring
them back into contention. soon
started working. The Danes simply
could not pull away. Finally. as
seemed inevitable. Hamilton tied the
game at 67-67.

The emotional tide then broke.
With Rob Clune moving the ball.
Cavanaugh and Keane shooting.
and a patient pass-oriented style
prevailing. Albany slowly but noisily
shot Hamilton down. An alley-cop
play from Cavanaugh to Carmelo
Verdejo sealed the game. but the
crowd was too emotionally charged
to sit on the impending victory.

Coach Sauers slowly removed his
starters. Verdejo fouled output! the
fans were alloted their emotional
release. Verdcjo left to a half minute

doubts of their selection.

conclusive evidence to the four-man

had blundered in their choice of the
fourth and final school.

Albany convincingly won their
case. and the game as well. surprising
the Continentals 94—83 in front of a
noisy three-quarters ﬁlled University
Gym crowd.

“I told my team before the game
that I didn’t want any upsets.“ said
Albany coach Dick Sauers. "And
there wasn't any."

“They outplayed us." said
Hamilton coach Tom Murphy.
“They deserved to win.“ Murphy
also noted that Hamilton‘s winning
streak was “fun while it lasted. Now
we go back to basics." he said.

With 23 seconds left. a ﬁve-minute

running about by various ofﬁcials.

the gym's inhabitants to purge
themselves of their excess adrenalin.

Pep Band Surprises

For the Albany players and coach.
the intensity persisted long after the
game. as the mixed-gendered Pep
Band surprised them in the locker
room. The acoustically perfect
locker room walls ampliﬁed the
trumpets of “Sweet Georgia Brown."

which he set against the Continentals
two years ago.

Tip-ins. driving layups. jump
shots. and even a left-handed hook
shot were part of Cavanaugh‘s
dazzling repertoire. “That was the
ﬁrst one I took in a while." said
Cavanuagh of his book. which was
one of his l6 ﬁeld goals in 23
attempts from the floor.

Poise. it was Albany‘s poise that
stood out the entire game. especially

Second—Field Listing Suggested ‘ 

by Alan Smith .
* SUNYA undergraduates will no
longer have their academic “second
fields" approved by their major
advisors. if the University Senate‘s
Undergraduate Academic Council
approves a proposal submitted
Wednesday by its Curriculum
Committee. '
In an attempt to establish
“structured second ﬁelds." the report
proposes that all second ﬁelds other
than those that are interdisciplinary
or combined with the students‘
major carry “a discreet title“
approved by the Curriculum
Committee or the Interdisciplinary
Studies Committee of the UAC.
According to the report.
acceptable second ﬁeld titles will be
determined through UAC review of

suggestions submitted by each
college. school. program. and
department from within the
university. The ﬁnalized list will then
‘be made available to students
through SUNYA's Center for
Undergraduate Education (formerly
University College).

The Committee cited inef-
fectiveness of the original second
ﬁeld requirement as its rationale for
the proposal. The original
requirement. approved by the UAC
in l97l. defined the second ﬁeld as
“A new concept which
required understanding by the
faculty and students to become fully
effective."

According to the Committee. this
joint understanding “never fttlly
occurred."

Acting SUNYA President Vincent O'Leary ls roeonsldering an earlier
dectslon to move the School at Educotlon to the Draper campus.

The report cites the
“interdepartmental” second ﬁeld as
an example of this lack of
understanding, calling it “the most
potentially dangerous sourceof non-
coherence."

“Mechanisms would still be
present to meet an individual
student's unique needs and
interests." according to the report.
"but the door would be closed on
allowing any mish-mash to pass as a
second field.“

If approved by the UAC and the
University Senate. the proposal may
be implemented in the fall. according
to Curriculum Committee CUE
representative Leonard Lapinski.

The new requirements would only
effect incoming students. although
faculty advisors and CUE Associates
may “consider this requirement in
suggesting courses to be included in
the second field."

“We‘re concerned about the

Senate Adopts New Calendar; Smoking Ban

by Mark Shilling

The University Senate voted to
recommend four university policy
changes at its March meeting
yesterday afternoon. The bills
recommended were proposals for
the 1979—80 and l980-8l academic
calendars. a revised course
withdrawal policy. a measure
requiring instructors to retain final
exams for a semester unless returned
to students. and a ban on smoking in
academic rooms. lf Acting SUNYA
President Vincent O‘Leary approves
the bills. they will become SUNYA
policy.

More Convenient

The 1979-80 and l980-8l
calendars. as proposed. would delay
the beginning of the fall semester
until after Labor Day. Reasons
given forthe change included greater
student convenience in obtaining
summer jobs lasting through Labor
Day, greater faculty convenience in

attending conferences scheduled for
late August and early September.
elimination of the “lost week" in
educational accomplisltment
occurring before Labor Day. and an
increased ability to compete with
private colleges for students. The
loss of a week's worth ofcourse-time
would be compensated for by
expanding the class period to fifty-
ﬁve minutes.

in a departure from SUNYA
calendar policy guidelines. the
number of reading days before
spring ﬁnals would be cut back to
one. This change was recommended
so that exams would not have to be
scheduled on Saturdays during
ﬁnals week.

Another departure from the
policy guidelines involves the
scheduling of classes on Good
Friday. l9lll. The Council on
Educational Policy. submitting the
plan for Senate approval. justified

the Good Friday classes by noting
that an already tight academic
schedule made it “difficult to justify
the additional suspension of classes
on religious days which are not State
holidays."

The Senate also endorsed a
revised course withdrawal policy.
which gives course instructors sole
authority to grant “W” grades to
students. The bill intends to clarify
the present ambiguous policy which
allows either instructor or the
student's advisor to sign a drop card.

Absent Clause

Absent from the withdrawal
proposal was a controversial clause
in a previous bill allowing
instructors discretion to refuse
withdrawals to students.

Another bill okayed by the Senate
would require instructors to keep
final exant papers for a semester
after the exam is given, unless
returned or made availabie to

 

students. The purpose ofthe bill is to
allow students the chance to consult
with teachers over theirperforniance
in the exam.

Resolution Approved

Finally. the Senate unanimously
approved a resolution to ban
smoking from all classrooms. lecture
halls. and laboratories. The
resolution also called upon the
administration to place “limitations
on smoking in other appropriate
areas of the campus.“ These areas
were not defined in the bill. nor was
any provision made for
enforcement.

Some questions were raised as to
whether the measure can be
enforced. Upon passage of the
proposal. Senate Chair Donald
liishko suggested that Senators put
out their cigarettes. At least one
disgruntled Senator retorted. "I‘ll
put it out when Vince [O'Lcary]
signs the bill.“

adequate facilities." said Schmidt.
“Costs could be cut considerably by
using a lending system whereby
materials would be transferred
downtown as needed."

Nikoloff said the Education
“doesn't believe that they [SUNYA]
will provide the funds to do that.

provide adequate library facilities'

without drastically cutting the
availability of teaching aids.

"We need a full library. not just
Education materials." he added.

The loss of easy access to
computer facilities is another
potential problem facing Education.

Two or Three Trips

“The typical Educational
Psychology major makes two to
three trips to the computer daily."
explained Nikoloff. “and the mere
hook-up of a terminal downtown
won‘t meet that kind ofdemand.“ He
cited the time factor involved in
having a program run and mistakes
corrected as the chief concern.

Computer Center Director Bob
Robinson said that ifadcquate funds
were offered by the administration.
Education would be provided with
“comparable if not superior
facilities.“

Nikoloff acknowledged the good
intentions of the Computer Center.
but said that Education is skeptical
of the willingness of the
administration to provide funds.

“The uptown campus is where the
most good work can be done by
faculty and students." said Nikoloff.
“and we don't want to be cut offfrom
t.

“We could even lose clientele to
other institutions."
