Bennett said the class is“deﬁnitely
going to sue." He said the class will
begin the suitfbut that if it is not
ﬁnished before graduation, he will

' ask SA to assume the effort.

if this was the case, he said, SA
would give the class the $2600 in
exchange for Benecke's promissory
note. SA would then continue the
law suit. SA president Dave Gold
called this plan “feasible.” He added.
“i feel bad. lfit appears that the suit
will not be ﬁnished, we'll seriously
consider taking it over."

Marc Benecke was accused of
stealing $3,000 from the Class of‘78
while still a student at SUNYA. He
was tried and acquitted of third
degree grand larceny last fall in
Albany County Court. Benecke
signed a promissory note last year

two installments

Bennett has asked SA to pay for

Leventhal. He said Gold is
“reluctant to pay."

According to Gold, this is
not necessarily covered under the

Central Council Funds Magazine

by Dave Korn

Central Council voted Wednesday
night to allocate $2675 for four
issues ofa new SUNYA publication
called Focus. According to Jay
Gissen. a Focus editor. the
publication will have it
newsmagazine format.

Focus has been designed as an
alternative to ASP. Gisscn said.
"Since we are a magazine and we
don't have to come out every week.
we will be able to cover stories in
greater depth than ASP can."

Gissen also says the magazine will
not take a hard news focus.

Investigative Reporting

Lewis Anrcdcr. another editor of
Focus. said the magazine will
emphasize investigative reporting to
ﬁnd out “what‘s really going on on
campus." Articles will include stories
on culture. investigative reporting
and creative writing. he said.

Anreder also said he felt there is a
need on campus for another

publication. “1 don‘t believe that
ASP and Phoenix (the literary
magazine of SUNYA) can capture
all the facets of lift- that arise from
the actions and interactions of
H.000 individuals." he said.

Gissen also said Focus should
come out sometime during the
second week of April. It will.
according to Gisscn. come out every
[0 or l2 days on an alternating basis.
Focus will be free to the student
body. Anrcder said. It will be
approximately 12 pages long and
will not usually print more than four
pages of advertising.

The magazine will use advertising
revenues to supplement its SA
funding.

SA President David Gold said. "I
would like to see another paper on
campus because it is not healthy for
there to bejust one source ofmedia."
Gold also said SA “encourages any
and all alternative media. We have
an obligation to start up these people

by Charles Blaster

A SUNYA School of Business
professor is one of 26 SUNY
professors to receive ﬁnancial grants
under a program called “Faculty
Grants for the Improvement of
Undergraduate Instruction."

Assistant Professor of
Management Science John Fisk
received a grant of approximately
$2,000 for his proposal outlining a
game geared towards improving
production and ﬁnancial planning
skills. ‘

The grant. part of at SUNY
program which provides funds for
the support of innovative projects
and activities. was awarded to
professors at l7 other SUNY

campuses.

Fisk received his grant as
recognition for his achievement in
formulating a 50-60 page proposal
outlining a system he says will help
students learn to deal with the real
problems faced by a business
organization in its everyday
decisions.

“Business ﬁrms have to make
decisions which best satisfy their
overall objectives, and these
decisions often involve the trade-off
and interaction of various factors,"
says Fisk.

_ The purpose of the project.
according to Fisk. is “to construct a
computerized interactive game
designed to create a simulated

variety of interrelated factors exist,”
and to help teach students how to use
these factors to make decitions.

Fisk said he is quite excited about
the prospects of his system. and feels
that his studentoriented computer
game has many practical
applications.

“Right now, we're experimenting
with this system in a local Albany
business ﬁrm," he said. Fisk said he
hopes his system will be available to
aid SUNYA business students in the
near future. '

His grant-winning proposal is
entitled “interactive Game for
Production and Financial
Planning."

Colonial Tower Hit By Burglaries

by Janet Shea

Colonial Quad's Livingston
'l'ower had been hit by at least ten
burglaries during the last four weeks.
according to Department of Public
Safety Assistant Director John
Henighan. chighan termed the
number “quite high" for a one month
period.

Most of the thefts have involved
cash left in students’ rooms,
although calculators and jewelry
have also been reported missing. The
amount of cash stolen in each case
has ranged from one or two to 50
dollars. and no large items such as
stereos have been taken.

Henighan said there seemed to be
no regular pattern connected with
the burglaries, and Livingston
lower Director Gayle Griffith

agreed, “This lack of consistency to

the burglaries makes them very

frustrating to trace.“ Griffith said.
Honighitn said that "at least three

out of the ten victims reported
coming back to their rooms and
ﬁnding money stolen after locking
their doors.“ Colonial Quad
Coordinator Howard Woodruff
thinks that a master key may have
been involved in some of the
burglaries, but said he has been
unable to get conﬁrmation.

Griffith said the possibility that a
master key is involved is "hard to
assume." She explained that each set
of ﬁve ﬂoors in the tower has its own
master key, and that the burglaries
have all occurred on random floors.

But it is possible that a “great
grttnd master" key is involved.

“A great grandmaster kcy opens
everything in the tower," she said.
"This key is not issued to or by the
residence stall." She added that she
didn‘t know to whom this key is
issued.

Griffith said keys may have been
copied to commit the burglaries. “A

student might be able to find
someone on the outside who would
copy the keys issued to him by the
residence staff.“ Copied kcys would
then enable a student who has moved
from a room to gain access to the
room after someone else has moved
in.

Henighan declined to say if
students were suspected of having
committed the burglaries. but he did
say. “in two instances a man wristsccrt

has been given, but security has not
been able to link it with any name
yet. he said.

A residence assistant in the tower
who wished to remain anonymous
said many students there are now
taking precautions. The RA said he
warned the students in his section
not to keep sums of money in their
rooms and to keep their doors

According to Baron, the final

additional statistics on the cost of
