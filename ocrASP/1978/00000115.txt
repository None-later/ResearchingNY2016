A radio station in Norway. Mainc.‘

has staged what it calls a “Favorite

the lcss-than-tall listeners who are
displeased over Randy Newman‘s
"Short Pcoplc“ record.

The winner of station WOXO's
contest was Morris l'witchcll.

SIGNS OF LIFE
Astronomy magazine reports that
President Carter is expected to
include 520 million in his tip-coming
budget for the purpose of searching

tor irttelligcnt radio messages
beamed from elsewhere In the
galaxy.

lhc magazine quotes Robert
ldclson of the Jet Propulsion
laboratory itt Pasadena as stating
that “we're very optimistic that
approval will be granted. All the
signs look good."

expected, two different searches for
possible radio signals from space
would be launched. One search by
the Ames Research Center would
involve-a careful study of radio
emissions from a few hundred
nearby stars. The other. by
astronomers at JPL. would be a
relatively quick sweep, looking for
loud messages from 80 percent of the
stars in the known universe.

Q‘EUJVH
SAY "CHEESE"

A University of Michigan

psychologist is claiming that most

Americans don‘t smile enough.

Professor James V. McConnell.
perhaps the world's only
“smilologist.” says tests ltc has
conducted on volunteers have found
that most people smile much less
than they think they do.

Says the professor: “We've done
snrne research with videstape.
filming people in norrrtal
conversation. And most people are
surprised at how infrequently they
smile.“

The professor isquick to point out
that a smile is not a cure-all for the
world‘s problems. But he notes that

one study found that  l at of

the parents of juvenile delinquents -

were habitual non-emiters. . '

According to McConnell. when it
comes to smiling, most of us rank
nearer to Attila the Hun than we do
to President Carter.

OUCHLESS

A new dental process. now used in
Japan. reportedly enables a dentist
to fill a cavity without any drilling
and without any pain.

This is all said to be possible
because of a chemical called “GK-
lOl.“ The substance reportedly
washes away'thc decay by an acidic
process without harming the healthy
tooth or bone tissue.

The painless tooth ﬁlling process
was originally dcveloped by the
Tufts University School of Dental
Medicine, but it will be at least
another two years before it is used in
the US because of extensive testing
currently being conducted by the
Food and Drug Administration.

A longtime political foe of

Former Chief Executive Gerald . '

Ford, in what has been described as.
an cit-President's ﬁrst. is now
hawking the wares of a private
company.

Ford signed a contract last year in ,

which he agreed to help sell the
Franklin Mint’s new series of 100
medals which depict scenes from
American history.

The Associated Press reports that
Ford in doing so, has become the
ﬁrst American President to endorse
a comrnerical product in exchange
for money.

A Franklin Mint spokesperson
refused to disclose how much Ford is
being paid for his commercial
assistance. adding. however. that
“Mr. Ford believes in the free
enterprise system and is engaging in
that...his name is the selling point.“
the spokesman said.

THE DOG’S LIFE

A recent psychological study has
found that an overwhelming number
of pet owners find it easier to focus
their affections onthciranimalsthan
on the human members of their
families.

Dr. Ann Cain. a family therapist
at the University of Maryland. says
she surveyed the feelings of 62 pet
owners after noticing that many
people discuss their pets as if they
were family members.

Cain reports she found that about
half of tltc animal owners revealed
they. on a day-to—day basis. convey
more physical and affectionate
attention towards their pets than
towards their spouses. parents or
children.

She say that a whopping til
perccrtt of those questioned reported
that their family dog or cat reacted
just like humans to illnesses.

YOU TWO

The Lippincott Publishing Firm
has begun a $50,000 advertising blitz
to promote the publication of a new
book which claims that the world‘s
first cloned baby is alive and I4
months old.

The book is titled In His Image.
and claims to be a true account of a
“human baby created in a
laboratory." Ads for the book.
which is subtitled “The Cloning ofa
Man," say that the author. David
Rorvik. refused to divulge the names
involved or the place where the
alleged cloning took place.

At least one genetics expert.
ltowcver. is a little skeptical ofln His
Image. Dr. Wolfgang Epstein.
chairman ofthe Genetics Committee
at the University of Chicago says he
knows of no work enabling scientists
to reproduce copies ofhumans in the
laboratory.

In cloning. the nuclcas of a cell
from the model is implanted into a
fertilized egg. causing the genetic
copy of the model to be reproduced.

 

HOT AIR

Here's a new excuse: A man
arrested on drunk driving charges in
England says that he ﬂunked his
breatltalyzertcst b.eausc he‘s a ﬁre-
eritcr. and had lighter fluid on his
breath.

The tire-cater. Barry Silva. states
he will prove in court that he was
sober. and that the breath tests
detected the large quantities of lighter
fuel he had consumed shortly before
being stopped.
