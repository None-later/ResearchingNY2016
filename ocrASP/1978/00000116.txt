rock and roll werewolf and

his band of growling guitars

attacked Page Hall Friday

night, when Warren Zevon

appeared before a relatively
small but enthusiastic crowd. Zevon. who
referred to himself as the “acid-head
Steve Allen of rock and roll,“ brought
along his collection of stories he calls
songs. and provided a night ofsome ofthe
best rock and roll to hit SUNYA in a long
time.

Opening the show with a song entitled
"Johnny Strikes Up the Band,“ Zevon
had the audience right away. Dressed in a
black corduroyjacket, with round glasses
and moderate-length blond hair, he
looked more like a slightly overweight
John Denver than the leader ofa rock and
roll hand.

But rock they did. lhc second song of
the night. “Werewolves of London," had
the crowd clapping and howling right
along with him. Even the two gentlemen
with the top hats and tails approved, as
well they should. the guitars were
howling and Zevon's husky voice could

l). Altman once described in

"Harper‘s" the perceptions of

a Calcutta man who had slept

nightly on the same strip of

sidewalk for over 30 years.
How was it. Altman asked an lndian
lriend. that this man should be able to
retain his lodging for so long‘.’ The man
pays to keep the sidewalk clear of
squatters, he explained.

When even the more gross elements of
Indian culture are freely translated into
idiomatic English misunderstandings are
bound to occur. Such was the case
Sunday at the PAC Recital Hall when Sri
Chinmoy and his disciples treated a
standing-room only crowd of 300 to all
afternoon of instrumental music, hymns
and prayer.

Billed as a "concert," the program gave
the performers an opportunity to publicly
display their devotion to spirit. Perhaps
the program‘s sponsors found such

almost convince you that there was a full
moon.

Playing a piano and synthesizer, Zevon
was backed up by a band of some of the
most experienced musicians in rock
today. Led by guitarist Waddy Wachtcl,
who is best known for his work with
Linda Ronstadt, the band was tight but
still willing to let loose and rock when the
time called for it.

Wachtel provided many of the
highlights ofthe evening with his piercing
guitar solos. At times he played with an
intensity and feeling that could be felt
throughout the hall. Combined with
Zevon‘s intense. but not perfect singing,
the two make tip a pretty good one-two
punch.

The night also had its more mellow
side. With songs like “Mohammid‘s
Radio," and “Accidentally Like a
Martyr." Zevon proved that life exists
outside the fast lane too. Singing“Hasten
Down the Wind" with no accompaniment
but his piano, he showed that he can write
and sing with any of the more romantic
stars of this day.

Yet there were flaws in the show.

activity aptly termed. i did not and at the
time felt somewhat misled.

Sitting crosslegged between two vases
of ﬂowers, in front of a pink and white
backdrop, Chinmoy opened the
performance with several compositions
on the ersaj, a Bengali string instrument.
'l‘he ersaj emitted long, droning sounds
which worked their way inside me. lfmy
internal organs could speak, would they
sound like this?

We pray and met/Hale.

We pray for our perfection.

(I wonder what Chinmoy would think
of the Sex l’istol's lyrics.)

Sri Chinmoy left lndia in 1964 and
currently is based in Jamaica. Queens. He
is a prolific and world reknown artist as
well as one of the most respected

   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

During “Nighttime in the Switching

came through, and at more than one
point in the show he blew his own lyrics.
But the intensity with which he and the
band played, and the good-natured view
Zevon took when things did go wrong,

With head shavcn. Chinmoy looks
ageless but is actually 46 years old. A poet
and painter he whas written as many as
600 spiritual verses in a single day and
during the course of a year completed
over l00,000 works of art ranging from
whimsical pen and ink drawings to
abstract acrylics and delicate watercolors.

Highlighting the performance of
Chinmoy‘s disciples, who completed the
afternoon's program, was "Hearken."
Performing with only half its members,
the group consisted of six instruments
including the hammer dulcimer, tabla
and harmonium.

The woman sitting beside me said in a
soft voice that she thought the tabla
player was John McLaughlin, a one-time
disciple of Chinmoy. “That‘s something
to put in my review," Isaid. What's more.
it would be a real scoop were it true.
Unfortunately, the tabla player's name
was Ribhu Lepac. “lfJ.M. wants to play

more than made up for it. It was rock and
roll with all of its energy and its
unpredictableness.

As the title song of Warren Zevon's
new album says, “Well he's just an
excitable boy.“ Friday night at Page Hall
he was just that.

tabla under an assumed name, this one‘s
as good as any,“ I told the woman.

Jeff Baker, the dulcimer player,
described the group's effort as an
“attempt to play meditative music." He
suggested that it was best to judge Sri
Chinmoy's music in terms of its spiritual
content. “Through his music people are
able to receive," Baker stated.

Chinmoy did have an almost hypnotic
effect on the audience. When he played
the erdaj or sat in quiet meditation, his
body was in complete repose. He lacked
dynamism and ordinarily would have
been termed dull. The audience did not
applaud and took great pains not to rustle
in their seats. For people used to
associating music with bodily expression.
Sri Chinmoy‘s restraint was strange and
perhaps unappealing. Nonetheless. in
looking around the hall I saw a number of
his followers meditating and quite a few
others spacing out. at the very least.

Braving the cold, tens of SUNYA students

camped outside the Campus Center Monday
night in hopes of obtaining choice seats to
UCB‘s April 2 concert featuring Renaissance
and Al DiMeola. By eight o'clock over 250
anxious concert goers waited for doors to open,
but there were some who were able to catch
some shut-eye dispite the crowd and the noise.
