"creative .
license

To the Editor: -'

. I am sure not the kind of person towrite lots
of letters to strangers. especially the media.
But I feel that I have to.

Like you must by now know. there‘s this
committee here on this campus at the
University at Albany that's got to deliberate
on the undergraduate experience, writing-
wise, following the Ortali SCRUE report
making a report with recommendations.
telling the community what there‘s todoabout
it. Now it‘s not very nice to always go around
saying our writing is poor, or lowquality cause
the way I see it it‘s got to be not too bad seeing
that this university is not an easy one to get
into.

I sure know individuals that really can‘t
write hardly much more than their names and
also some others that write good enough for
books including one ofyour Editors. After all
their's is a whole range of talents out there in
the state of New York and even in the entire
US. I was thinking ljust got to write to you
about this last night riding the bus. Sol ﬁnally
got around to it, bringing me to my main
point: that riting is relativelike l’lato‘s age. as
our philosophy taught us.

Now looking where it is at, what on this
good green Earth is the difference whether
each, and every, one of us dots their i‘s and
crosses their t's. placing their comas just right.
It‘s not like you're evaluating an integral in
math or setting there at the computer terminal
so that it's either all right or all wrong and no
two ways about it. (Actually in math they
usually give partial credit — but I‘m meaning
answer-wise.) In writing there‘s no sure right
and no sure wrong. andwcttll know it. Like We
learnt in my poetry class last year there are
even professional poets like c. e. cummings
who violate the laws of writing. License they
call it. Well, we got our liccnsc too; that‘s for
sure.

> But to get on with the point I have seen u
laculty around here, not trying to be on a
creative license you know. who could write a
lot better than he has. Because incomplete
sentciiccsitnd dangling participles area part of
his oIIiciiiI university documents. even some
that go out into the world beyond these four
walls. And that's a scandal for sure. I at least
always check each. and every, sentence to

 

ﬁFElFFER

make sure they liitvc subjects and it verb.

So what is the point? The point is this 'I
lheyire going to bother us abOUt this writil
thing when it doesn't matter once we leais
thm halls of ivy (—Hahll. then they bitici
bother your faculty and adminlhttilltits about
their writing too since it would I):

can go wrong (and usually do) at a function of
this sort. Performers can be late. Equipment
can malfunctioan any event, that complaint
of his was totally absurd.

It is hard to see how he could get even more
absurd than that, but he did manage to. He
next complained that he had come to see
Dizzy, not an unadvertised warm up band. If
he had inspected his ticket prior toentering he
would have noticed the words “and special
guests" directly ,under Dizzy Gillespie. My
opinion was that “The RisingSun was perhaps
the best 'warm-up band I‘ve seen at Page Hall.
There have been some real dogs. but Feb. 4
was deﬁnitely not one of them. But of course,
that is not the point. I Suppose the author of
that letter would have enjoyed comingto l’agc
Hall at 7:55, find his seat just its Dizzy was
coming on, and make it hoinc hv l)200 in time
to catch his favorite TV shows. There is more
involved in a concert than that.

His linal complaint was aimed iii the
audience. particularly the smokers and
drinkers. What a person does tit a concert is
their own business as long as it docs not
infringe on the rights ofothcrs. Since there are
no regulations at Page Hall about drinking . I
see tto problem in the passing iirotind til a
flask.

However, some of us did not restrict
ourselves to the passing of a ﬂask. Herein lies
the author's one valid complaint. lor thcrc tire
regulations against smoking iii a public plttcc.
However. since the profs all this school seem to
be having great difficulties in stopping tltc
cigarette smoking in lecture centers, I can see
no possible means. short Ul massive riots.
which will put an end to the smoking ol
cigarettes and hooch which has and will most
likely continue to go on til it“ SUNYA

It is the opinion of this ztytlitn that that
author has shown hiltISCll to bc it \cry poor
dcbator. He has gone out and nttitcltcd nearly
everyone who attended the slum at Page on
Feb. 4.

Perhaps Concert Board should consider

. . .and
how

To the Editor:

It seems to me in reading the ASP that a
large number of people have the idcti that the
Wily to decide who to hire and who to fire
should be solely on educational criterion.
There are other factors.

Some professors are smaller than others.
This means that we can save money by giving
them less office space.

Some professors make more phone calls
than others. By keeping professors that live
near campus we can save on long distance

 

Some professors like to bathe?
administrators with room changes and
curriculum changes. We save time (and wear
and tear on out administrators) and therefore
money by keeping professors'that can do little
things by themselves and don‘t complain too
much.

These and other considerations cannot be
ignored when making personnel decisions.

When you‘re at a school that doesn‘t have a

on greater and greater significance. Here‘s

A one... moped  n

examining a proposal to establish an art-campus women’s health care
clinic, with an-e'ye t0ward seeking various avenues of financing.
Due to an up-coming deadline dictated by SVUNYA’a budget policy,

'SA Vice President Kathy Baron submitted only a draft of a proposal

that will be released later this month. Yet even in its rough form, the plan
outlines both a very serious problem and one possible answer. I
The proposal calls for a total re-vamping of the present SUNYA
Contraceptive Clinic by‘ an expansion of hours, a reduction in cost
(including the initial $17.50 ﬁrst visit charge), an increase in counselling
for sex-related problems and the creation of a board of directors that
would provide signiﬁcant student representation.

The total cost for the program is projected to be $32,000. The reasons
for allocating such a sum are obvious when one talks to women who
have visited the campus clinic; obvious when one questions the reason
behind SUNYA students making the trek to Albany’s Planned
Parenthood rather than the more conveniently located clinic; and
obvious when one realizes the amount of sex-related counselling that
must now be handled by Middle Earth.

The obstacles to such a women’s health care facility as contained in
the proposal are equally numerous. Director of Health Services Janet
Hood stands firm in her defense of the present contraceptive clinic
terming it the best clinic in the SUNY system and stating that it provides
“95 per cent of what they [the students] want."

Equally formidable is the SUNYA budget process. Yet where there is
a need there can, indeed there must, be a way.

There can be no talk of SA financing such an operation. Providing
such a clinic that can properly deal with gynecological problems is as
basic as providing an infirmary that can treat Russian flu.

It would somehow ease the pain of paying a $l7 this year under the
misleading nomenclature of "health fee" if one could look at a health
services equipped to deal with the entire student; whether the student
was happy or troubled, sick or well, impotent or pregnant.

Over the next few weeks,  for Student  Neil‘brown willbe . . '
