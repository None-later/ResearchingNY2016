' Throughout the game. Albany
had been attempting to use
Cavanaugh and Verdejo inside and
exploit Hamilton's downfall.

Unable to handle the talented
Dane big men. Hamilton was forced
tofoul them. Early in the second half
Oliver picked up his fourth personal
four. Coach Tom Murphy decided
to keep Oliver in the game. but have
him not gamble on defense. Albany
took advantage of Oliver's inhibited
play to score from close range.

“When their big men picked up
fouls they stopped playing defense."
said Cavanaugh. "When I would get
the ball inside, Oliver would back
mvay and not challenge the shot."

With time running down. Albany
rose to the top of their game.

  

 

Freshman guard Rob Clune
executed a whirlwind series of plays
that shook the Continentals. Clune
twice stole the ball directly from
Hamilton guards in mid-dribble.
then connected on ujumpshot and a
layup to bring the Dnues to within a
basket at 74-72.

Finally. after battling back for so
long. Albany caught up to
Hamilton. Verdejo hit a layup with
4:35 remaining to tie the score at 76
and quiet some of the vocal
Hamilton routers.

Two free throws by Ciunc gave the
Danes their ﬁrst lend since the
opening minute, and now it was
Hamilton in an unfamiliar
comeback role.

With 1:07 left and Albany ahead
81-79. Keane went to the foul line to
shoot one and one. I'wo hits by

missed the free throw and gave the
Continentals another chance.

“I let my concentration wander.“
explained Keane. “I knew this was
my last game and I wanted to go out

reprieve given to them. The amazing

The crusher came for Hamilton at. .- To

l:48 in overtime. Verdejo drove to‘ '

the hoop. Oliver met him. There was
slight contact. but as mouse the
whistle blew Oliver knew what was
coming. It was the All-Amarlcan's
fifth foul, after playing almost half
the game with four fouls.

Oliver departed having scored 29
points on II for I4 from the floor. It
was a tremendous performance. and
the tournament MVP award he
received was well deserved.

It was only a matter of time for
Albany. The partisan crowd would
not admit defeat, but their team
would not defeat Albany this day. _

With one second remaining.
Cavanaugh stepped to the foul line.
raised his list into the air. and put in
the shots that nudged his team over
the century mark.

They were Cavanaugh’s 32 and 33
points of the afternoon. another
