said Earl.

The Danes only exceptional
player in a losing effort was Howie
Nusinov. He led the Danes to a near
comeback. in the third game. The
Danes led l3-l2. but West Point won
the serve and ﬁnished the match with
three straight points.

Last Saturday, in contrast to their
demoralizing loss to West Point. the

Danes returned to their winning form.

in Queens, they defeated Queens
College and Merchant Marine
Academy.

The Danes beat Queens l5-6. l2-
i5, i5-2. and I5-iO. Queens college,
a first-year squad, was lacking in
talent. Coach Earl was able to use all
ll players in the match. and all
played well.

In a revenge match for the
Merchant Marines, the Danes again
finished on the winning side. The
ﬁnal scores were 15-] l. l0-l5. I6-l4,
and l5-5.
