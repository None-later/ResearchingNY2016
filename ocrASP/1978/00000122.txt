tallied like a statistic. Winning the
ECAC Upstate Basketball
Tournament proved ' what the
Albany State players and coaches
already knew; that their teamtwas
something special.

startling defeat.

In addition. all this must be at
Utica College. a foreign court. with
deafening cheers for the opponent‘s
every move.

Not only did the Great Danes
meet the challenge put to them. they
soared above it. After pushing aside
Oneonta 59-49. the Danes played
their finest game of the season.
defeating Hamilton l0l-95 to win
their ﬁrst post~season tournament in
the team's history.

“This is the greatest feeling I've
ever had." said Kevin Keane. the
team's captain who ended his four-
year career after the Hamilton
championship game. “I'm usually
not that emotional. but i couldn't
hold back."

It was Keane who accepted the
championship plaque for the team.

moved by the proceedings.

The tournament opened up with
Albany taking on Oneonta. When
these two teams meet the game is
usually slow-paced and low scoring.
Saturday night‘s game was no
exception.

Albany built up a large lead in the
game. and then saw most of it slip
away. Oneonta's strategy was to
slow down the more talented Danes,
and the Red Dragons repeatedly
held the ball for minutes at a time. A
lackluster first half ended wrth
Albany on top 29-l5.

Oneonta staged a comeback. due
to their improved shooting and
Albany's uninspired play. A—Rick
Dcxheimer jump shot brought
Oneonta to within a point at 44-43.
and the Danes ﬁnally realized that
they were in danger of losing the
ballgame to an inferior team. The
Danes then went inside to their big
men, and that ended thecomeback.

Albany‘s biggest man. Barry
Cavanaugh. made Dane basketball
history in the game. With 4:39 to
play. Cavanaugh scored on two free
throws. his 1000 and l00l career
points.

The junior center is only the ninth
player in Albany history to score
l000 career points. and only the
second to reach the mark in his
junior year. Cavanaugh‘s l2 points
in the game and Carmelo Verdejo‘s
l5 points and l3 rebounds led the
Danes to the victory.

“We weren‘t really mentally
prepared for Oneonta." said
Cavanaugh about his team‘s less

looking ahead to the championship
game."

Hamilton reached the finals of the
tournament with an exciting 83—8l
victory over Utica. Cheered on by a
sold—out Utica Gym. the home team
stayed right with the Continentals.

Hamilton‘s Willie Jackson
banked in a l0-foot shot with one
second remaining to give Hamilton
the win. setting up a rematch of the
last dramatic Albany-Hamilton
contest.

The championship game was a
fitting tribute to both teams. The

JV Five Enters Record Books

by More Shelnbaurn

As the ﬁnal seconds ticked away
this past weekend at Cornell. the
Albany State junior varsity
basketball team had to feelaspecial
sense of pride. They had come
through a long. 20-game schedule.
and that victoryon the last day ofthe
season (73-65). gave them a new
Albany State jayvce win record of
Ill.

They had tied the old mark on
Thursday night with a victory over
RPI (65-57). But. Saturday‘s win
was the big one that they had strivcd
for.

“We set the record as our goal
early in the year." said Coach Bob
Lewis. “We kept that in our minds
and workd hard towards it."

Saturday night‘s ﬁnal half action
was very close. as the teams
jockeyed for an advantage. The
lead changed hands several times
until six minutes remained in the
half. At that point. Albany was able
to grab the lead for good. They led at
halftime by a 35-32 margin.

But. Cornell wouldn't say die.
They stayed in range of the visitors
throughout most of the second half.
Albany's lead only once got as high
as l0 points.

Yet. once the Pups got that far
ahead. there was nothing that was
‘: going to stop them from achieving
l‘.thcir goal. Cornell tried. but they
couldn't catch the ﬁred up jayvees.

“We were really up for the game.“
claimed ctr-captain Ron Knox. "'l he

intensity really began to pick up
down the home stretch. once we
realized that the record was in
reach."

Steve Low and Marty Mc(iraw
provided the scoring punch.pouring
in l8 points each. Jim Bittkcr
followed with [6.

“McGraw riddled their zone.“
remarked Lewis. "He was tough
outside. and Low and Bittker were
doing a good job inside."

Thursday's game against Rl’l was
a game ofstreaks. The Pupsjumped
off to a tremendous start. hitting
their ﬁrst lZshots to give them a l2-
point lead. But. just as fast as they
began. they cooled off even faster.
hitting only two of their next l4
shots. They went on to take a 36-27
lead into the locker room atthe half.

Strong Comeback

Rl’l came out in the second half
looking like they were ready to upset
the jayvecs. They scored the first I]
points of the period to go up 40-36.
They overplayed the Pups on
defense. forcing them into R very
poor shot selection.

ilustling on both ends ofthe floor.
Rl'l held their opponents scoreless
for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes and 40
seconds of the halt. The l’ups looked
to be in big trouble. until Steve Low
got them on the board with a pair of
freethrows.

Ron Knox entered the game and
pumped in two quiijumpers to gel
the Albany offense moving. Albany
regained control of the game from

then on. taking its much as an eight
point lead. They were able to
maintain their advantage due to
some consistent free throw shooting.
and aggressive team basketball.

Erv Roberson played a fine all-
around game. while leading the team
with 16 points. Bittker was the only
other player in double figures. with
ll. Marty McGraw. Lee Gardner.
and Knox each scored it.

Time and time again. Jim llittkcr
has been one of the top guns on the

 

Danes trailed throughout the entire
game. but fought back time and time
again.

Winston Royal broke the early
tension with a jump shot. and
Albany had the first points in the
game. A Billy Southworth jumper
tied the score at 2. Albany then fell
behind. and could not pull even until
nearly 35 minutes had elapsed.

Hamilton opened up by hitting
shots from all over the court. All-
American Cedric Oliver was
unstoppable for the Continentals.
scoring l4 points in the ﬁrst halfand
making many of his shotslook easy.

When Oliverwasn‘t scoring. it was
John Klauberg. Hamiltons other
All-American. who hurt the Danes.
Klaubcrg‘s uncanny shooting ability
netted 22 points for the game.

Dane coach Dick Sauers used his
bench freely. looking for the most
successful combination. Reserve
center Kelvin Jones came in. and
immediately contributed to the
Dane cause. Jones drove down the
middle, went up to shoot. btit

team. His ability as an L J and
his desire as a competitor should be
an asset in his drive to make the
varsity squad next season.

As for the rest ofthc team. it could
be the last season of collegiate play
for many of them. The varsity is only
losing one player (Kevin Keane) to
graduation. and it‘ll be tough to push
any of the established players aside.

“They're all good ballplaycrs."
agreed Lewis. “I‘d just like to praise
them all for the season they had for
the junior varsity team. It‘s hard to
say whni'll happen next year
though."

It was an incredible season for the
jayvees. Only three points separated
them from an undefeated season
(two-point loss to West Point. and a
one-point loss to Mohawk Valley).
After being 9-2 earlier in the season.
they heated down and Woo their last
nine straight. The only thing they
had to shoot for this season was the
record. since their is no post season
jayvcc competition.

lfl told you ﬁve weeks ago that the Albany State varsity basketball team
was going to be in the playoffs this year. you probably would havetold me to
take a walk. And rightfully so. After all. on Jan. 31. the Danes had a 6-7
record and were struggling just to lmish with a .500 season.

But that was ﬁve weeks ago. Since then it has been a totally different season

for the Danes.

This past weekend. they culminated their second season by not only
playing in a tournament. but winning it. The Upstate ECAC Division III

tournament.

Their second season began right after their second overtime loss to Union
on Jan. ill. It was Albany‘s seventh loss ofthc year. Six of those losses were
by less than live points and three ofthem were overtime setbacks. Albany had
only six wins at the time and theyjuiit weren't able to win close games.

But this year‘s team was young. There was only one senior. captain Kevin
Keane. two freshmen and two sophmores. It took some time to get to know
each other. maybe a little longer than other teams. but when they did. there
was almost no stopping them. In those remaining five weeks. the Danes won
nine of l l games. First they ran it ﬁve-game winning streak together. dropped
two games to it Division I and Division ll school and then cappedthc season
in winning style with four straight. Andthclast four made Albany‘s season.

No longer did they lose their poise in the closing minutes. Against titles on
Feb. 25. Albany won down the stretch by four points.

Then came the coup de grace. Albany had just learned they were not
selected to participate in the NCAA tournament and a chance fora possible

’ national title. They were robbed without a dottbl. The team chosen ahead of

Potter Club May Have To Move

by Karen Murphy

As a part of Residence ()fl'icc plan
to increase the number of coed
dorms on campus. Potter Club may
be pulling up anchor from Hamilton
Hall on Colonial Quad and movnig
to nearby Johnson llnll. according
to Acting Director ol Residences
llcnry Kirchner.

I'oltcr (‘Iub President Al lirnssnrd
feels that the move is "a threat tootir
perpetuation its a club. I just can't
help bttt feel that we're being singled
out . , . We'rejust screwed.“

Potter t‘luh was informed of the
change lucsduy at a meeting with
Colonial Quad Coordinator Ilowic
Woodrul'f. Potter (‘lub President Al
lirassard. and Kirchner. According
to Kirchner. the move is not the
result of the findings of a special ad-
ltoc committee formed last spring to
investigate complaints against
l’otter Club.

According to Woodrul‘f. “'lhis
decision was made to irrelevant of
that committee and is a resident
program as opposed to a disciplinary
action.“

Another all male dorm on
Colonial. Zengcr Hall. will iilso
become coed next year. According
to Woodrul'f “That housing [Zengcr
and Hamilton] will not be available
for any continuing student sign-up.”

Kirchner said the reason for not
allowing students who currently live
in the two dorniii to return next year

is to “give the dorms a fresh start as
coed dorms. We want to make them
more desirable to students. They had
very low rates of returning students
last year.“

l'herc are ltlZ more men than
women living on Colonial Quad and
tire decision to add two coed dorms
was made to correct this imbalance.
according to Kirchner. Morris Hall.
am all female dorm. will not be made
coed. he said.

’I‘rcniendous Effort

According to Potter (‘luh Pledge
Master .lefl' l’eters. " l he
administration doesn‘t realise the
tremendous effect moving as from
here to Johnson will have. In
Johnson there is no space for
another club room and Potter Club
has labored long hours setting one
up iii Hamilton furnished with a bar
and mural."

The move to Johnson is viewed by
members as a threat to Potter Club’s
existence. S'l'll fraternity presently
resides in Johnson and Potter Club
members feel that if they move in
With S'l'li. one group or the other
will disappear.

According to Kirchner. in a
sample he took two thirds of
incoming students requested coed
housing. “Single sex dorms present
more problems like vandalism and
rowdyness whereas the quality of
programs is far superior in coed
dorms."

The Residence Office's push for
more coed dorms might also affect
Schuyler Hall on Dutch Quad. the
home of TXO fraternity. According
to Dutch Quad coordinator John
Murphy. he has received written
requests from TXO that their dortii
be made coed next year. “I hope it‘s ii
possibility.“ he said.

Kirchner said he thought that the
decision had been made to make the
dorm coed next year.

Kirchner said he is “assisting
Potter Club in exploring a variety of
alternatives" since they are opposed
to the move. l’otter Club has resided
in Hamilton for the past l4 years.
