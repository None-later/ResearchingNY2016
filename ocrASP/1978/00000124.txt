approach to it.“ He would not

be an increase in security measures

Class of ’81 Election Invalidated

by Aron Smith

Class of ‘SI presidential elections
were invalidated yesterday.
according to SA Commissioner of
Elections Doug Freedman.

'l'hc invalidation occurred after
write-in candidate Saul Aaronson
complained of the use of
"questionable campaign tactics“ by

_’Steven Silverberg. the winner and

only candidate for president on the
ballot.

According to Freedman.
Aaronson's allegations against
Silverberg included “insinuating
that Aaronson was not a

matriculated student that he
wasn‘t eligible to run for office and
that‘s why he wasn‘t on the ballot.
which was untrue.“

Silverberg ahd also been implying
that he was an SA-approvcd
candidate “when there is no such
thing.“ and claiming that Aaronson
does not live on campus. said
Freedman.

SA‘s Election Commission heard
evidence form both Aaronson and
Silvcrberg before deciding to
invalidate the election bya4-2 vote.

According to Freedman. the
Commission charged Silverberg

 

 

with violating section 73 of the
Election Regulations Act. This
section states that “no person will
destroy or cause to be destroyed any
part of a candidate. or unfairly or
uncthically attackacandidateorany
purl of his campaign."

“We're trying not to condone any
questionable practices." said
Freedman. “We‘re getting stiffer
with what is legal and what is illeagl.
We're trying to keep it as clean as
possible. We want candidates to run
on their own records rather than
knocking other candidates down.
especially when the facts are untrue.”
