Sharryl Hziwke. the founder ol'the
Association for the Only Child
Family says that only children are
being given a bad reputation by
people who wrongfully claim they
neurotic. unhappy and spoiled.
Hawkc. heiself the mother of an
only child. and the author of the
book. One Child By Choice. says her
research shows that “onlies” are

children who were punished by
'physical means as opposed to
psychological means is that the
former were apt to become
delinquents and to develop
aggressive anti-social behavior.
They say this is particularly true if
the physically punished child was a
male. .

An cxperimentul program at the
University of Wisconsin has found

embarrassing to the ofﬁcers when
the tests showed the white powder to
be just that: white powder
containing no narcotics at all.

The amphetamine charges were

dropped. but the police still

managed to come out of the affair
with their pride intact. The actress
was subsequently charged with
possessing a small quantity of‘
marijuanara substance theﬂo‘fficers
claim iliey'foiind during a thorough
search of Carne‘s home.
