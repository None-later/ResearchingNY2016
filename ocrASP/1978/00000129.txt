afe Jacques are a relatively
new band from the British
Isles who perform pop music
within a progressive rock
context. Like many others in
their genre they are proficient, clever and
slick. Their current release, Round the
Back. is indeed a Well executed
performance skillfully contained in wax.

Unfortunately, for those who prefer
their rock and roll a bit gutsy this album
might be a disappointment. It does tend
to come off over—contrived and
superﬁcial at times.

Nevertheless. the album will attract
a few ears. A number of the cuts are quite
listenable and some are certainly suited
for F M play.

Highlights of the album include“Ain‘t
No Love in the Heart ol'the City.“ which
features a goodvsense of rhythm. “Crime
Passionelle" v ' has ' imaginative
an g, ‘< that ﬂow nicely. w

"Meet the Button"
Warner Bros. AS 1/5]
I‘ “HM—.—

By RICH SCHENKMAN
t all began in Liverpool, in
I959. Ron Nasty met Dirk
McQuickly, and decided to
start a legendary rock and roll
band. Soon the boys met
guitarist Stig O‘Hara. and finally decided
on Drummer Barry Wom. After several
years of playing clubs like the Rat Keller
in Hamburg, the Rutles returned to
Liverpool, found their manager. Leggy
Mountbatten. and started to gain
national prominence. Their fame spread,
and now everyone knows the story of

Rutlemania.

What? You never heard of the Rutles.
The fact is that the “legend that will last a
lunchtime“ was started sometime last
year. Eric Idle. of “Monty Python's
Flying Circus" and his friend. Neil lnncs,
leader of the now defunct Bonzo Dog
Doo Dah Band. wrote and starred in a
television series in Britain called

 

 

 

,“Rutland Weekend Television," a weekly

parody of televisionrprogramming. One
episode of‘the series dealt with the Rutles,
and obvious Beatles’ parody, in verse and
rhyme. The Rutles‘ ﬁrst hit. “I Must Be in
Love" popped up. on .the “Rutland

IWeekei'id S'on'gbook", and the Rutles‘

first. ﬁlm, “A Hard Day‘s Rut" was
advertised in ldle‘s “Rutland Weekend

, Dirty Book.“

The most important American
exposure the Rutles got. however, was

‘ when scenes from "A Hard Day‘s Rut"

were shown on the N BC show. “Saturday
Night.“ The excitement created by the
clip was enough to warrant the
production of a film for television about
the rise and fall of the Rutles, and
subsequently, the recording of an album
of the Rutles' greatest hits.

As for their later hits. “Doubleback
Alley" is an incredible parody of “Penny
Lane“. and “Piggy in the Middle“ makes
mineemeat out of"l am the Walrus" (we
are not treated to a recorded version of
the oft mentioned “I am the Waitress“).

The fascinating thing about the music
on this album is that it is enjoyable and
interesting to listen to on its own merit.
Spend a moment or two listening to the
lyrics. and they‘ll put you in stiches. The
Rutles is the greatest rock-comedy album
to come along since the genre began.

   
     

“Not Shy
Columbia .l(' .15th
Walter Egan
By DENNIS SCHEYER

ho is Walter Egan and why is

Lindsey Buckingham co-

producing his new album?

The answers to both these

questions have a lot to do with
an easy listening album called NoI Slit".
and can be answered by just playingtliis
new LP.

For an obvious reason (lluckingham‘s
co-produccrs are Stevie Nicks and Mick
Fleetwood). the album sounds quite a bit
like Fleetwood Mac at times. The beat on
“ Finally Find a Girlfriend" is identical to
“Dreams,” But luckily this is not the case
with most of the album.

Egan‘s voice is hard to describe; it is not
overly pleasant but with Buckingham and
Nicks harmonies it is quite listenable.

It is not until side two ofthc album that
Egan finally rocks out. “I Wannit“
features every familiar rock and roll
guitar riff you‘ve heard in the last ten
yearswno complicated lyrics A-but it is a
catchy tune. Annie McLoone doubles on
the vocals with Egan. She has a powerful
voice that compliments Egan‘s well.

“Hot Summer Nights“ is not too
common a title for a song these days.
Basically the lyrics are a combination of
" Night Moves“ and all the other summer
songs by Pierce Arrow. Meatloaf, Eddie
Cochran. etc. Nothing special here. just
good listening music. /

If you are into Flcctwood Mac
and things of that ilk this album will go
right next to Rumours in the heavy play

pile. Ifthis is the case. buy it and have fun. J

By LIZ HILL

fter more than a decade of

entertainment and service to

the Albany area underits belt,

the Eighth Step Coffeehouse

continues to thrive as the
longest existing non-profit coffeehouse in
the country.

The undying strength in popularity of
the Eighth Step was exhibited last
weekend as English country ballads
singers John Roberts and Tony Barrands
sang, played. and recorded an album
before a crowd of close to a hundred
people. . Similar entertainment acts
continue to draw people each weekend,
and various activities are offered
throughout the week as an interesting
alternative to the downtown bar scene.

The activities include movie classics,
country dances, and amateur artists‘
auditions. The auditions may include
anything from banjo strumming to light
bulb eating, as long as it‘s legal.

Located at the northeast corner of
Washington Park.-at l4 Willet Street. the
“Eighth Step" has lived up to its claim of
being much more than a coffeehouse. Its
members take a unique attitude toward
the function of the coffeehouse, which
partially explains its many years of
existence. They make a concerted effort
to open their arms to any local group
needing assistance in getting started or
surviving. Those efforts have resulted in
the development and maintenance of
such local organizations as “REFER,”
the downtown advisory council. and the
Dove St. Co-op.

The Eighth Step aims to give Albany
residents more than weekend
entertainment and a good cup of coffee.
They want people to fch as if the
coffeehouse is their second home. a place
they can retreat to at any time for help.
Through an arrangement with SUNYA.
the Eighth Step now offers a community
service program to SUNYA students who
are interested in getting academic credit
for their volunteer efforts.

Another unique aspect of the Eighth
Step‘s success is its membership policy.
For $3.50, anyone can become a yearly
member which entitles them to free
entrance on weekdays and reduced
admission charges on Weekends when
popular live acts appear. Non-members
that show up during the Week and pay the
$1 entrance fee automatically become
members for three months.

Situated in the basement of the First
Presbyterian Church, the Eighth Step
was completely gutted last February
when fire struck as a result of faulty
‘Wiring. Threatened with the possibility of
extinction, the members turned to other
local churches for assistance. They were
given a Sunday school room in the Trinity
Methodist Church in which they
continued their weekly functions without
it sound system and kitchen. The Sunday

 

school was certainly not condusivc to

 
  
 

The" Step’s Back
Bigger Than Ever

weekend coffeehouse entertainment and
people became anxious to see the .
coffeehouse back in operation. Even
though insurance covered reconstruction
costs. furnishings and a new sound system
still needed funding.

In August. as finances reached an all-
time low and activities were limited to
Weekly country dances. the Eighth Step
was given new hope when they received a
grant from the First Presbyterian Church
to get things rolling again. A revival
concert was held the weekend before
Thanksgiving. It featured Spongy
Delights, Nelly Brown. Bill Spence. and
Scott Alerick among others. The
proceeds from the concert went toward
paying off redecorating bills.

Along with the $3000 raised at the
revival festival came a steady stream of
contributions and support from local
residents. merchants and churches, which
really meant the difference between life
and death for the Eighth Step.

The total efforts of all those interested
in the coffeehouse was enough to
reconstruct the Iiighth Step to its present
bigger and better state. The finished site is
still in the basement of the First
Presbyterian Church. but now room has
been made for twice as many guests. with
seating for [50 to 200 people. A new
sound system and kitchen also makes for
some pleasing sounds and smells. Guests
should check out the \HtiL‘ variety of
herbal teas and home—made pastries
available.

I he Eighth Step isa popular retreat for
those people living in the Washington
I’art area, and uptown SUNYA students
have also become frequent visitors. The
musical entertainment offered is mainly
bluegrass. country. folk, string bands. but
non-electric ja/I bands have appeared
too, and the Step is always willing to try
new acts. As former manager Jake Bryan
said. “We‘re there to provide what people
are interested in."

Coffeehouses are dying rapidly in the
Capital District. Reactionary Mary‘s was
forced to shut down because of lack of
funding. They were packed to the gills
when live acts appeared. but they didn‘t
have enough room to raise the money to
pay performers and the bills at the same
time. The Freeze Dried Coffeehouse at
SUNYA was also on the brink of
extinction earlier this year. but has
happily come back stronger than ever.
But since its foundation in March of I967.
the Eighth Step is made up for lost time
and has a membership of over 2000.

Tonight the Eighth Step will feature
balladeer Fred Stanton. with folksinger
Ed Snoddcrly following up at 8:45 on
Saturday. Next weekend. classical
guitarist John Pearce will appear on
Friday night. The ever-popular folk-
music duo of Robin and Linda Williams
will be featured Saturday night. Anyone
interested in a friendly evening and a
relaxed atmosphere should visit the

Eighth Scp.
