To the Editor:

As I write this letter I am seething with
anger.
Last night. Saturday, Mnrch 4, I went to the

fnflrmury as the result offccllng fl grout dcuf oi
pain on the right side of my mouth. I had not
been tlbfe to sleep the previous night and
found It agonizing to chew on food. 'I'herc had
not been a doctor on duty at the time i tlrrived
Ind l was therefore examined by u R.N. who i
found to be both helpful and considerate. She
told me that part of my mouth was badly
swollen and that I had a white spot in my
throat. She then gave me several painkillers

(after calling the doctor) for the night and
instructed me to come back to the inﬁrmary
the following morning.

The following morning I was examined by a
Dr. Dennis. After looking into my mouth. Dr.
Dennis concluded that there was no visible
evidence of anything which might cause pain.
and therefore I could not possibly feel a great
deal of pain. He then proceeded to lecture to
me about how one of the great faults and
characteristics of my generation is our
inability to cope with pain. He also stated that
if one gets out ofbed in the morning withsome
minor irritation he should learn to live with it.

| llm well aware of the popular sentiment of
holding in high esteem those who are able to
silently suffer. while the converse is true ofthc
habitual complaincr. For this reason I was
hesitant to write this letter. I feel. howeVer,
than the opinion and comments of Dr Dennis
are totally unjustified as l have never found
any corrclntion between onc‘s generation and
onc‘s threshold for pain. l'urthcrmorc. I do
not constdcr myself to be :1 habitual

When farmer President Ford wanted to close the books on” the
atergate scandal, he pardoned Richard Nixon. ' ~

Well, Higher Education Services Corporation President Eileen

Dickinson has decided to close the books on HESC's total mess-up of
last year‘s TAP application processing. By doing this, Dickinson is
pardoning HESC — at the expense of students. ‘ '

Last year, HESC was unable to process thousands of TAP
plications because of problems incurred when the corporation

switched over to a new computer system.

As the applications backlogged, the situation became desperate:

H ESC failed to provide students with the needed ﬁnancial aid, colleges

manded full tuition payments, and students became caught in a

financial crisis they had not created.

It would be interesting to find out how many students were actually

f orccd to drop out of school because they couldn’t generate the money
for tuition they had expected to get from TAP awards.

After coming under sharp criticism for this disastrous situation,

HESC recognized and finally began the process of making payments.

HESC estimates that there are still l500—2000 students who have not

received their payments form last year. An April 15 deadline has been set

Dickinson after which no new inquiries about l977-78 awards will be
llsldered. This d *ndlinc -  only a month away ——closcs the books and

potentially shuts out many students who were entitled to TAP payments
but urc ill lust in the processing somewhere.

What needs to be emphasized is that the mess-up was HESC‘s fault,

not that of the students. The students have already suffered and by
crcatingthis deadline,
right to llle ' on award »— which is essentially tellingthcm this is all their
tough luck 21nd that everything should be forgotten.

H ESC may be cutting off students who have a

A mujor problem is that HESC doesn’t know who should receive

these payments 7— i1 is their faulty system that has produced the

oblcm. in August. the State Senate’s Task Force on Critical Problems
urged that HESC “must bear the responsibility for the disaster that
used so much difficulty for the higher education community at large,
d the students in particular.“

By closing the books on this situation while some cases may still be

floating, HESC is neglecting this responsibility.
