Co-‘captain Dave Rubin was the
last one to set a school mark. He

Albany. These four team members
set new school records in each relay.
They were fourth in the 400-yard
medley relay in3:46.6 and ﬁfth in the
800-yard freestyle relay in 7236.6.

The highlight of the meet for
Albany was the 400-yard freestyle
relay. Albany coach Ron White said,
“Rehfuss swam coming right off of
the ﬂu. two of our swimmers shaved
their heads (an Albany ﬁrst). and it
all culminated in a spectacular
showing in the 400-yard freestyle
relay. We held the lead until the first
leg. the guys had phenomenal splits
(Rehufss —— 49.47. Gozenbach —
50.37, Rubin —49.66’. and Dwycr~
49.59; total: 3:]9.4). and I'm very
glad we were able to hold onto a
second place, a very unexpecteed
victory for ourselves.

Quality Meet

“It was a quality meet and I would
have like to have seen us heat
Oneonta. but they have an
outstanding diving squad and that
put them over us. the same thingthat
prevented us from beating them last
year.“

Spinks Suspended For 90 Days

NEW YORK (AP) Heavyweight
champion Leon Spinks was
suspended for 90 days by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission - a
suspension that holds weight at least
with the World BoxingCouncil - and
a proposed rematch against
Muhammad Ali ir ' new African
nation was thrown out because ol'an
outcry against it.

Johnny Mangiaracina. citccutivc
officer of the Nevada State Athletic
Commission. a‘ member of the
World Boxing Council. said the 90-
day suspension was due to a rib
injury which three physicians say
Spinks suffered before his winning
titlc ﬁght with All Feb. I5.

Bob Arum. president of Top
Rank. lnc.. which has promotional
rights to Spinks‘ next three fights.
said the new champion will not fight
again until September.

Arum also said: “As a result of
discussion with representatives of

the Organization of African Unity ttt
the United Nations and with olficiiils
of the National Association lor the
Advancement of Colored l’coplc.
Top Rank will not hold bctwccn
l.con Spinks and Muhammad Ali in
llophutliatswnnii.“

"In accordance with the spirit of
the spirit of the General Assembly
resolution which denies the
independence of the
llophutliatawuna created by South
Africa. the fight will be moved to an
independent African country."

Arum said other sites outside
Africa were not ruled out and neither
was Ken Norton being ruled ottt as
an opponent. Spinks. however. has
siiid he wants Ali next.

The announcement of a proposed
fight in Bophuthatswana brought a
storm of protest from various black
civil rights groups.

As for the medical suspension.

Suspects Linked To Burglaries

by Jill Hither

A rash of recent burglaries on
Colonial Quad remains unsolved.
although about ten of the incidents
seem to be related. according to
Department of Public Safety
Assistant Director John Henighan.

Police have issued descriptions of
two suspects. both black males. one
full with a medium build. and the
other about 5‘6" and stocky. aged 23
to 35. The property stolcn has
usually been cash and jewelry.
according to Henighan.

All but one of the related
burglaries have occurred in
l.ivtngston Tower.

“Some of the incidents have only
one or two of the characteristics of
the other robberies btii we think
they‘re all related." Henighan said.

According to Henighaii, the
burglaries have been occurring for
about a motitli and “indications are
that there have been others which

weren't reported."

“I don‘t think any one person has
lost over forty or fifty dollars worth
of property." said Henighan.

One of the suspects matches the
description given by a female
resident of Alumni Quad who was
approached last weekend by it man
falsely claiming to be from
University Police. said Henighan.

“In some cases. students swore
their doors were locked. Colonial
Quad Coordinator Howie Woodruff
said.

According to chighan. there is a
possibility that the thieves arc using
a master key. Woodruff said.
however. that no keys were missing
from citltcr rcsidcncc or custodial
staff.

Woodruffdid say that at least one
suite door had been rc-kcyed
because the suite had been
burglarizcd twice. The cost of
changing a lock is $l4. he said.

Committee Seeks Retrenched Prof. Rehirings

by Denise l.eiici

Members ol the SUNYA
( ommittcc for Conccrncd l‘actilly.
and several i‘cti'cnchcd SUNYA
faculty members. say the SUNYA
administration has not lived tip to its
contractual obligation to find
teaching positions in the SUNY
system for the 321cnurcd professors
fired from SUNYA during l974-76
program rctrcncliinents.

Clifford Brown. a member of the
committee. siiid that Acting SU NYA
l’residcnt Vincent ()‘l.cary and
Associate Vicc President for
Academic Affairs Robert Shirley
have made no effort to rchirc
rctrenchcd tenured professors. A
clause of the current agreement
hctwecn United University
Professions and the State of New
York requires this be done. he said.

Recent Report

A recent report on SUNY
retrenchments by the State
Assembly Higher Education
Committee found that “remedial
attention is needed with regard to the
issue of retrenchment" and
recommended as one possible option
"establishing provisions for the

rchiring of retrenched tenured
professors."

“We have made every effort to
place these people." O'l.cary said.
"They have been notified and
interviewed for openings.“ Last fall
Shirley was assigned the task of
keeping track of rctrenclices and
making sure the correct procedure
for dealing with openings was
followed. 0‘l.eary said.

A I977 report on academic
freedom and tenure by the American
Association of University Professors
cites a clause of the agreement
between UUP and the state which
defines the policy for rchiring
rctrenched faculty. The report states.
". . .the released employee would be
given special consideration for
placement within the university if a
‘suitablc position‘ was available for
which the individual was ‘otherwise
qualified'; and that for a period of
two years the released employee
would be offered re—employment in
the same or similar position if an
opening should occur at the affected
campus."

Shirley said the retrenchees have
been notiﬁed of job openings on all

SUNY campuses. and that the
provisions for rchiring in thc UUl’
agreement are followed.

“Every time a position is open
tltcrc is a seven day period for
rctrenchces to apply. A decision is
made on this before any other
application is considered." Shirley
said. All applications are reviewed
by thc department which has the
opening. he said.

SUNYA English Department
faculty member Myron Taylor and
Economics Department faculty
member Donald Reel). who are
members ofthc committee. both said
the administration is not trying to
find positions for the retrciichcd
professors. and have in fact hired
others.

“Anytime the administration
wants to rchirc these people they
can." Taylor said. He charged that
openings are sometimes
intentionally distorted to make
overlooking retrenchees possible
“The slightest change can be made in
a job description to make people
unqualiﬁed."

Taylor said SUN} Central could
put pressure [on the SUNYA

t

administration to rchirc the
i'ctrcnchcd professors.

Several rctrenchcd professors said
they arc dissatisfied with SUNYA's
efforts to rchirc them. Craig
Henrickson. a former Chair of the
Anthropology Department. taught
at the James E. Allen Center when
that program was rctrenchcd.
llcnrickson has since applied fortwo
positions in the Anthropology
Department but has had his
applications rejected by a vote of
faculty and students in ilie
department.

Henrickson filed a grievance
action against SUNYA after he was
rejected claiming that the
administration did not make an
effort to place him in a suitable
position. Henrickson now husa two—
year visiting position in the
Anthropology Department. which
he says he was given by SUNY
Central as a settlement of his
grievance.

But Henrickson said most ol‘those
retrenched have not been given
positions when they‘ve opened up.
“Tenured people who are qualified

According to one victim of the
burglaries. who walked in on
thieves Saturday evening. the suite
door had been locked by her
suitemates about ten minutes before
she arrived.

“I came upstairs to get my coat
with a friend. l walked into the suite

the door was unlocked then s
and saw two black guys in my room.
When I realized what was happening
1 grabbed one guy‘s coat. but I didn't
hang on. Heaskcd wliethchohn was
hcrc 7 7 which I knew was a bullshit
question --r— and then they ran out of
ther room. My friend chased them
but then he lost them." she said.

According to Henighan, the reports
University Police have received
contain descriptions of the event is
similar to this account. "The
common method of operation is to
knock on suite doors and if anyone
answers ask ‘Where‘s the party‘!‘ or
'thrc‘s John'?‘. If no one answers.
eithcrthey cnterthe suitethrough an
unlocked door or perhaps use a key
on a locked door."

According to Woodruff. all the
dorms Will be locked and chained
over the spring vacation.

Henighan said that University
Police olficers have been alerted to
the description of the suspects but
that “most crimes are occurring
inside dorms and students don't
want officers patrolling thedorms.“

He said that appropriate security
measures would be in effect over
vacation but -declined to describe
them for fear of jeopardizing their
success.
