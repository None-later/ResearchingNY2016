group's increased visibility has
already resulted in a growth in
membership over that held by
EOPSA. she said.

“We had over 200 students at our
initial meeting who indicated that
they'd like to become actively
involved.” said Campbell. “What
we‘re stressing about this
organization is that we want to
involve as many students as possible
in our program planning."

ASUBA. like EOPSA. will
sponsor activities geared to appeal to
black students

A dissatisfaction with EOPSA led
to the creation of ASUBA,
according to Howard Straker. who
was one of the people who worked
on publishing Unity.
