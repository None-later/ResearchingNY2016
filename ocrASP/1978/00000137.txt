Customs ofﬁcials may be
surprised when they inspect a
slupmcnt of promotional gifts which

“Gong Miiiture.” Planet 'Gong
claims this mysterious mixture is.
grown on “tea farms“ in the"
Himalayan foothills of Asia.
Custonu ofﬁcials. however. may
give these gifts special attention as
they arrive in the United States:
that's because gong is an old drug
users' slang term for opium.
Members of the group insist the
cigarettes contain a legal herbal
smoking mixture. and nothing more.

DEAR DIARY

The Karcn Silkwook case is
emerging as a major stumblingblock
in the American government‘s
cfforts to develop a Iargc-scalc
experimental breeder reactor.

Scicncc magazine reports that a
personal handwritten diary. which
was maintained by Silkwood until
her dctith thrcc years ago in ti
mysterious car crash. threatens to
delay thc government's proposed
multi-billion dollar "fast tlux fucl“
hrccdcr reactor at Htinl‘or.
Washington.

The magazine says that Silkwood
charged in the diary. found after her
death. that thousands of defective
nuclctir I'ucl rods were bcing turned
out the Kcrr-MchcCompany at the
()lkuiioma plant were she worked.

According to the publication.
evidence has since surfaced backing
up many of Silkwood‘s allegations,

' Titesc allegations are'b'ecomirig a
problem for the government because
the smiled “fast flux test fertility“
at Hanford. the ofﬁcial name for'the
new breeder project. is using no less
than I9,000 of the fuel rods turned

. out by the Kerr-McGee plant.

Science magazine says that the
evidence which continues to emerge
in the Silkwood case raises “the
question of whether the nuclear
industry can regulate itself.”

BIG EARS
An Iowa grand jury is reportedly
looking into allegations that the
telephone company is secretly

establishing a remote-observation

wire-tapping center in Davenport.
Iowa.

Former “phone phrcak" John
Draper. who is also known as
“Captain Crunch." charged recently
that telephone ofﬁcials were sctting
tip a new system that would curable

AT&T agents to intercept any phone,

line undetected.

The Village Voice reports that. as
ti result of these allegations. Draper
was subpoenaed to Dcs Moincs
where he testiﬁed before a secret
grand jury there looking into phone

important information. . . it was
terriﬁc tobe able to speak freelyto
powerful people. On another level
the whole thing really freaked me
out.” .
Draper. who has been. under
surveillance by phone company
security agents. was busted in' New
Jersey last December for allegedly
possessing a phone phrealting
device. Those charges have been
dropped. however. on the grounds
that his arrest was unconstitutional.

KID STUFF

In legal terms. this case should be
called "Slime versus Yuk."

That‘s because the Mattel
Corporation. the makers of that
gooey toy known as “Slime.” has
filed a federal court suit against the
Hot Items Company. the makers ofa
similar product called “Yuk.”

Mattel is complaining that the
presence of "Yuk" is causing
“Slime's‘f sales to slip. Mutth-
contends that "Yuk" is an out-and-
out copy of “Slime.” citing as
evidence the descriptions on the
packages. "Slime" is described on its
package as: “It‘s gooey. drippy.
oory. cold ‘n clammy. For all ages
over ﬁve."

"Yuk" describes itself as: “It‘s
silly-chilly. oocy-gooey. glows in the
dark. For ages over live."

Mutth adds that no sooner did it
come out with new. improved
"Slime" featuring plastic worms.
called “Slime Worms," than Hot
Items did the same. "Yuk" isout with

BOY SCOUT BAN

The Boy Scouts of America. an
organization which bars
discrimination on the basis of race.
color and religion. apparently has no
provisions to protect Gays.

Two members of the Explorer
Scouts in Mankato. Minnesota.
have been expelled from their local
post after they admitted they were

gay.

Scott Ford. I7. and Scott Vance.
to. say they appealed their dismissal
to the Director of Public Relations
for the Boy Scouts of America in
New Brunswick. New Jersey. Thcir
expulsion was then upheld at the
national level.

Said Scott Ford. onc ofthc scouts
who wascxpcllcd:“lthinkihe public
should be informed that there is
discrimination against
gays . . _ most people aren‘t willing
to talk about it. Whatever can
happen hcrc (in Munkalo) can
happen anywhere.“
