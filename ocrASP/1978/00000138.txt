regular or special class placement within
the public school system."

Vincent ()‘l.eary continued by saying
that in tttturc years. the telethon that
people Will talk about will be lelethon
'78.

"I‘m sttre sortie of you have noticed that
over the past ten weeks I have been
visiting the dining rooms of the
university." Laughter. "And e\ery quad I
visited. without lail. sttidents come up to
me and say, ‘they imtst haxe known you
were coming.‘ "

()‘l.eary assured everybody that over
the next few weeks he would be visiting
the quad that he felt needed his help the
most. llowewr. he did not say which.

After the preliminaries. everything was
repeated for 'l elcvision llour. Kevin
i‘erent/ came ottt and sang “Working
logether. Helping Each Other." an
original composition and lor those of you
\\ ho don‘t know. the theme of this year‘s
telethon.

A note about lelethon SUNYA's
lelethon is the largest student
tundraising event in the country. and it is
not only a two day event in March. it is a
year round happening. From the
beginning there are donut and bagel sales.

lesson. "

'l’-shirt sales. and much, much more.

Since I was ttot present for all of the
acts. I apologize that l'm only able to
comtncnt on a few oftheonestlntt I saw.

Shortly alter herentl. there was a
young gentleman by the name (iary
Douglas playing an original piano
composition entitled "An Original."
Douglas showed smite outstanding
versatility on the piano.

Another delightful act was llob

Despite having to be down on one knee
for the entire song. he surprised some
people by sounding a little bit like Billy
Joel himself. However. song and dance
were not the only kind of attractions that
people came by to see. There were pies
being thrown at all those people that we
know and love.

My thrill of the evening was seeing
accounting professor Harold Cannon get
hit with a pie. Asked how it would feel
getting hit in front of all his students, he
said, "Wet." Just before Cannon gotthe
pic. I met him backstage and questioned
him further. w

“Are you lookingtﬁﬁkard to it.“l

“Cannon was then carried onstage by some
members of Delta Sigma Pi, who went about
teaching him a different type of accounting

asked. He replied. “I will not be looking
forward to it. When it comes forward. I
will close my eyes."

Brave l)r. Cannon laughed at the
thottght of repenting and told me. as the
big moment approached he felt “sick”.
Then he was carried onstage by some
members of Delta Sigma Pi. who tltcn
went about teaching Cannon a different
type of aecotititing lesson.

“This is the debit side". said one person

cheek. "this is the credit side.“ Then to top
it off. the students taught the teacher
about adjusting entries and brought the
pie down on Cannon's head.

Cannon‘s reply: “I feel clean."

I spoke to one of the young men who
had the pleasure of hitting Dr. Cannon in
the face with the pie. "Oh. 1 love it. It was
great getting back at him for all the
torment he put me through in 2| I." said
Ron Ravenko.

Another delight I got was seeing SA
President David (iold getting hit in the
face with a pie by SA Vice President
Kathy Baron. who then in turn got hit
with a pie by Anne Markowitz. Asked to
comment, Gold said. “It's a good way for
her to get out all her frustrations."
Further. he was disappointed that the pies
were not Strawberry Shortcake or
Chocolate Cream Pie. Gold said that he
would have to make some budget
appropriations to get those types ofpies.
Kathy Baron was more enthusiastic
about getting hit in tch face. “Oh. it‘s
great. I'll have to dothis every morning."

After the pies. M. Johnson and
Company came out and did a small
production number to the tune “Short
People" by Randy Newman. After the
song ran through ottec. the girls ran out
into the audience to collect money. bttt
not before squirting the audience with
water guns.

Shortly after that 1. along with

everybody else. had the pleasure of

watching tourjugglers whose namcsl was
unable to get (sorry guys). However.

many of the famous juggling acts with
props nobody else would have thought of:
a power hitter for example. To top off
their act. they juggled with fruit and
performed the "Treacherous four-way
ball juggle." One thing is for sure. they
were on stage making a lot of people
smile.

One of my favorite acts was when a
group of songs were immortalized by
Kevin Ferentz and Marc Disick. They
started off with a little shtick and
proceeded to play four handed
"Chopsticks" (PDQ Bach would be
proud of them). They proceeded to play
“Heart and Soul" which received much
applause from ,the audience. With the
audience in a great mood. they proceeded
to play “That's Entertainment" and a
group of Broadway and movie songs such
as: “Give My Regards to Broadway.“
"Cabaret." “Hello Dolly.“ “To Life."
“There is Nothing Like a Dame" and
“Supercalifragilisticexpialidoeious." At
the end of their act. you could even see
scattered standing ovations.

In my opinion those were some of the
highlights of Telethon ‘78; however. the
biggest highlight was the uncovering of
the filial total of Telethon ‘78: 531,000+.
T his represented the efforts of countless
numbers of people who gave their time
and effort. not only on lelethon night but
from the beginning of the fall semester.

O‘Leary summed up the evening when
he said. “l want tojoin you tonight in an
institution that is aware ofhuman beings;
one with the other and one with the
outside World. '1 he best lelethon of all.“
