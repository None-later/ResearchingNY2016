Soon after thespring vacation, this campus will'quickiybe cluttered

by Rob lllgley .

Each year over three million students are
haunted by an array of standardized
admission tests. From Iowa and Stanford
Achievement tests in elementary school tothe
MCAT‘s, LSAT‘s, and GRE‘s in college.
students have been told to accept the “fact"'
that they are only as competent as their test
scores indicate. Despite the popular
acceptance of standarized testing as part of

the Educational Testing Service. ETS is an

pass through the portals of the ETS. These
tests which decide the fates of millions are
written by only 58 people.
it would seem reasonable to assume that an
organization which has such an important
impact upon so many lives possesses a high
degree of accountability to those whom tests
forcibly control. Unfortunately this is not the
case as ETS is not accountable to any outside
agency. its financial records. procedures and
test evaluatjion methods are not matters of
public record. E l'S has adamantly refused to
respond to serious inquiries in these areas rind
other sensitive issues such as the steps it takes
to insure proper use of test results by colleges
and universities. As Ralph Nader states. ETS
luxuriales in its creation of". . . a new kind of
power: the pOWer to define and quantify

claim ofinfallibility has made costly errorsin
other areas. In addition to losing transcripts
for 200 law school applicants from SUNY

Albany. ETS has been accused of numerous
incorrect score reports. incorrect scheduling.
late reporting of test schores nad mechanical
errors. Other criticism has centered around
ETS racial and cultural bias in making the
tests.

The ETS has too great an impact on our
lives for it to be left unregulated. While other
inductircs are made responsible thorugh
government and public accountability. ETS

regulate this monlithic corporath structure in

idea that the impact of the tests on education
requires some degree of public accountabilin
on the part of the test making corporations.
Senator Ken La Vallc (R-Suffolk County)
along with members of the Assembly Albert
Vtinn (D-Brooklyn) and lvaii Lafayette (1)-
Queens) have introduced this “lruth in
Testing" legislation in the State Legislature.
Senator La Valle asserts that “having control
of the data and the tests represents a great deal
of power over individuals in our society." The
legislation would make more information on
the tests available to students. parents and
educators by requiring that all studies and
evaluation of the tests be filed with the State
Education Department where they would be
illViliiitbic under the Freedom of liitormatiori
.aw.

Valle. Vaiiii. and Lafayette. as Well as
NYPIRO good reason to believe that it has a
strong chance of becoming law this year.

The ability of a student to perform the tasks of SA president or vice
president is not based on how much money the student has
Concurrently, a student‘s chances of obtaining an office should not be
based on how much money he/she can spend on a campaign.

There must be some sort of regulation on campaign spending to
prevent the job from going to students of the same economic bracket.
This will not be an easy thing for SA to tackle. There are a number of
options, such as setting a ceiling on spending or having SA provide
limited campaign funding. Naturally, there will be problems With any
proposal to limit spending, mainly because it would be difficult to
enforce as even the honest politician does dishonest things in the
desperate moments of a campaign.

A change in SA philosophy is what is most needed in regards to
