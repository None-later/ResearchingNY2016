 Cia‘nStudents Score?

by Leslie Vingan

i feel as though i should be on a first name
basis with the women working at Drop / Add.
With each successive ,trip back (there were
four in all). their tone grew more impatient
and their rueful “tsk-tsking“ more audible.
Perhaps I only imagined hearing them
whisper. “Prepare yourselves  here she
comes again!“

Why the repeat performance? Did I hold a
special fascination for the artsy carvud walls in
the Assembly Hall? Hardly. Apparently I had
walked into a number of classes with either
high expectations or no knowledge of what lay
ahead and received ti rather rude awakening.
Certain courses I recognized as immediate
hammers and dropped them after one sitting.
while others took several dosesofseli-tnlhctcd
“punishment” before signing myself out. the
option of dropping a course and replacing it
with another one less oii'ciisnc is, oi course.
very appealing.

Others seemed to agree — on any given day
during Drop/Add week the Assembly Hall
was packed with disenchanted students. each
trying harder than the next to restructure a
worthwhile program of stud). liie
disenchantment took on several forms. bill the
reason for it was pretty consistent from person
to person. Listening to the casual bantct in tire
room i overheard one comment tutti its
variations repeatedly: "l |tist didn‘t kiioii \\ hat
I was getting myself in to." l leci this cicnicnt

rather ineffectual publications. One oftbem is
the Undergraduate Bulletin, providing general
academic information. university regulations
and course listings. The other is the
Assessment of Courses and Teachers, a.k.a.
ACT. supposedly providing just that —
objective assessments. Unfortunately, neither
publication is making the impace that itcould.

The much heralded yearly AC'i' booklet is
in theory a terrific idea. but loses sotncthing in
its application. Coordinators of former ACT
booklets have stated. “ ‘Wc tire of the opinion

necessary for them to make informed
dcctsions concerning their academic future.‘ "

blurb describing course histteris generally
accurate, but too brief tilt" explanation on
which to base course selections. Just as tin
example, Psy 397 — Directed Research -—
tells the student nothing about prospective
tasks. time commitments. or kind of research
under study. The blurb merely reads. “The
course provides the opportunity for a junior
student to work on a research project under
the supervision of a faculty member.“ This in
itself is deceiving. for often the student works
solely with a graduate student and merely
glimpses faculty members in passing. This is
only one instance of an incomplete course
sketch as provided in the Undergraduate
Bulletin.

What if the two university publications were
to combine forces? One comprehensive
booklet could be created. providing course
listings and evaluations. A student would
come away knowing something about
proposed subject matter. and in addition
something about expected reading load. test
and grading procedure. interest level of
lectures. and other pertinent facts relevant to
course selection. the format might be an
expanded version of the current
Undergraduate Bulletin. with listing followed
by more subjective accounts and course
synopses. One entry might read:

l’sy 203 Child Development (3)

social emotional and intellectual
developments; the relationship between

drop' a course (and add one in its place) inilht '

be virtually eliminated; pre-registrtition might
assume signiﬁcance once again. with students
actually ending up in courses shosen during
that period! -

Certainly the time, energy and funds used in
creating this new volume would more than be
made up for in the reduced bureaucratic
paperwork of Drop/ Add and the reduced
expense of printing both ACT and the
Undergraduate Bulletin. Perhaps a new
committee is in order —— the Special
Committee to Overhaul and Revise

Evaluations — or SCORE for short, whose

purpose would be to study the feasibility of
creating and implementing this improved
course book.

I don‘t foresee immediate change in any of
the current university publications or
procedures, but i feel the proposals cited are
worthy of consideration. 1. for one, would be
pleased to serve on the “SCORE Board“ A~ it
would sure beat standing on line for four days
during Drop/Add week.
