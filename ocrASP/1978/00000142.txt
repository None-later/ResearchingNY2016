Gaylord Perry and Ron Fairly. both
.39, and Mickey Lolich. 37. .

All three graybeards were in the

was the ﬁrst spring training Old

Perry hurled three strong Innings,
allowing one unearned run. and
Lolich. making a comeback after
sitting out the 1977 season, worked a
scoreless ninth as the San Diego
Padres edged Japan's Yakult
Swallows 3-2.. Meanwhile. Fairly

delivered a two-run double to help

the Callifomia Angels defeat the
Padres“B' squad 5-2. -

Except for batting practice.
Lolich, who last pitched for the New
York Mets in 1976. hadn’t faced a
hitter in 17 months.

“It felt strange.“ he said. “Without
the batting cage i had no depth
perception."

But Lolich has no doubts that he
can come back. even though he
conceded that he “couldn‘t
remember anyone doing it" at such
an advanced baseball age.

“The ﬁrst pitch 1 threw opening
day was half-speed and l was
surprised it had that much life.“ he
said. “i threw the next pitch as hard
as I could and I knew then that I
hadn‘t lost my last ball. Gene Tenace

Most of the Padres' regulars were

in Yuma. Aria. to face the Japanese '

team and the Angels didn‘t take
kindly to the depleted squad San
Diego sent to Holtville. Calif.

“This is no insult to the players out
there, but the people came to see
Dave Winﬁeld. Gene Tenacc, Rollis
Fingers and George Hendrick.“ said
Angels General Manager Buzzie
Bavasi. “This is a violation of the
commissioner's ruling that teams
should be well-represented and the
manager should accompany the
team."

instead of filing a formal protest.
Bavasi said he plans to send a ‘3‘
team to play the Padres in Yuma
next month.

“He‘s entitled to his opinion. but
we did not intend to slight the Angels
or anyone else.“ explained Bob
Fontaine. who succeeded Bavasi as
vice president and general manager
of the Padres.

PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP)
Commissioner Pete Rozelle voiced
'concern Monday that complacency
amoung the National Football
League's club owners could tear
apart the unity the league has
achieved in recent years.

“A lot of the problems got out of
the way this past year —— the
bargaining agreement. getting out of
the courts on major issues. having
ﬁnancial stability for the next four
years with the television contract.”
he said during a break in the winter
meetings.

“i feel that with these outside
things taken care of. our biggest
threat is probably ourselves.
Sometimes. when you‘ve got
problems. you can get unity. People
say. ‘Wc‘ve got to work together to
beat this problem.‘ Now we‘ve got
the problems out of the way. We‘ve
got stability . . . What we‘ve got to
say is, ‘Lct‘s not mess it up ourselves
by bickering. by getting upset at
what some club does . . . 

Rozelle also expressed concern
that Congress might attempt to
further tighten up the anti-blackout
agreement in which NFL home
games are not televised locally only if
the game is not sold out 72 hours
before kickoff.

Sen. Robert Grifﬁn. R—Mich.. is
introducing legislation to cut that
period to 48 hours, to make it apply
to all network team sports and to
make it permanent. The law was
passed in I973 and expired in I975
but was extended voluntarily the
past two years by the league.

“We have stayed close to the
Congressional committees and their
chairmen and we have said we want
to review the experience of last year
and get back to them. After
reviewing it. it might be that we‘ll
again extend the expired law
voluntarily.“

But he acknowledged there was no
way the NH. would refuse to do so
voluntarily. to refuse. he admitted.
would he to invite legislation.

“We don‘t want it permanent. Hi
say that. cause that's really tough to
get out of. liven if we were able to
prove an extreme case of gate
attendance hardship. you'd still have
to get the law voted out.“

Rozelle noted that the expired and
proposed laws involve “only those
sports covered by a network
contract. Football. all of our games
are obviously covered by a network
contract. A very small percentage of
the games in other sports are covered
by network contracts."
