one of those pitchers is harried Nolan

As a rule. it doesn‘t take much

at l00.9 miles an heur on Aug. 20.

hitters. But after a career that
includes four no—hitters. five one-
hitters and ii two-hitters, Ryan was
plagued by a sore arm during the
ﬁnal month of 1977. ‘

Any lingering doubts about his
condition were put to rest Sunday
when Nolan the K l'ired four shutout

his California Angels lost to the
Seattle Mariners 8-3. Ryan allowed
three hits and didn’t have a walk or
strikeout and the Marinersdidn't get
on the scoreboard until after he
departed.

“l was pretty sure my arm was
okay after throwing batting practice
three days in a row." said Ryan. who
was only supposed to go three
innings but tacked on one more
because he threw so few pitches.

"'l can't believe i made only 37
pitches." continued Ryan. who has
been knoWn to uncork that many in
one inning. "i needed more work
today."

While Ryan is established as one

innings as theCincinnati Reds edged

“I understand the situation." he
said. “There is a lot of good talent
here. If i lit in, ﬁne. if I don't, that‘s
fine. too. Just as long as i give my
best."

New You (AP) Butch Lee. an
unassuming \ young. man who
believes that the “power of the mind
can overcome any handicap; was
named winner Monday. of the Rupp
Trophy as the Associated Press
college basketball playerol‘thc year.

“i guess dreams do come true.“
Lee said as he picked up the
handsome bronze trophy severer
pounds heavier than the basketbttlls
ht- balunccs so adeptly at Marquette.

Lee. a landslide winner in the
voting by the nation‘s sports writers
ttnd broadcasters. used tithlclics as
the escalator out of New York‘s
ghettos to the 'top of the College
basketball world. he stiid.

"I set a very high standard for
myself." said Lee. “I wanted to be the
best. I wanted to be the player ol the
war in the country. Some people
itiigiil think that I put too iiinclt

And. maybe i did. But i don‘tthinkl
would have won thisaward ifl didn‘t
set that high a standard.

“it’s like the example a teacher of
minc always gives about the
bumblebee. They say that a

bumblebee is not supposed to fly.

that its wings are not strong citough
to carry the weight of its body. Ilui
somebody forgot to tell the
bumblebee that."

Lee. a product ol‘ New York who
starred at DcWitt (‘linton High
School. said he wanted soniclhing
bellcr out of life than what the city
streets ol'l‘crcd.

“Some people stand around and
take what life ol'l'crs them." said Lee.
“Mosl people are ncgulttc thinkcix.
'I hut‘s a mistake. You llil\i.' logo oul
and get things yourscll. lhut'x “here
the potter ol' the mind comes Ill. You

you can‘t then you‘re in trouble."

Lee thought in those positive
terms as he worked his way up from
the playgrounds of New York.

“i always took aim at thctop.cvcn
though people said i shouldn‘t." said
the broad-shouldered Lee in quiet
tones. “When I went to DeWitt
Clinton. they would say. ‘Don‘t go
there you'll get Iost."l‘hcy said the
some thing when I headed for
Marquette. i don't believe you
should put limitations on yours-ell
Ior anything.“

chronology would take Lee to the
pros next )’t.‘llrillltl he is well aware of
his value now that he‘s become an
honored player. Cliiirtictcrislically.
