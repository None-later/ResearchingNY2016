The Albany State track and ﬁeld
teamv participated in two
tournaments over the past week. and
came out with mixed results.

On Saturday, the squad placed
eighth out of I9 teams in tli'e‘Union
Invitational. A week earlier. the
team put together a ﬁne showing in
the Capital District Tournament.
finishing in second place.

Albany met up with some tough
c ompctition in “the U nion
Invitational, and placing high in any
event was a challenge. The Danes did
manage to come away with a few
victories. primarily due to the
excellence of Bill Mathis.

The ﬂeet sophomore set a school
indoor record in the mile run in
4:]6.5. breaking the old record by
more than one second. This gaudy
time was only good enough for third
place in the event. proving the
quality of the other participants.

Mathis‘ heroism did not end with
the mile run. The team of Steve
Kaplan. Erik Shultz. Mathis, and
Sean Reilly blazed through the
distance medley relay.

Reilly crossed the ﬁnish line yards
ahead ofany other runner, giving the
Danes their solo first place in the
meet. The relay time of l0:26.8 set it
school and fieldhousc record at
Union. bettering by nearly four
seconds the mark set last year by the
Danes.

Leading Albany in the relay was

Mathis, who clocked in at 3:06 in the
three-fourths mile leg.
"He ran a great three-fourths.“

'stated Albany coach Robert

Munsey. “His time was extremely
fast. and that was where we broke
the race openﬁ‘

The most frustrating event of the
meet for Albany was the longjump.
Don Dross led the competition
throughout the entire event. btit was
outdistunced by an RPI jumper on
his last attempt. Dross was beaten by
three-quarters of an inch. but held
on to capture second place for the
Duties.

Union placed first in their Iiost
meet, with Plattsburgh and RPI
finishing in the second and third
spots, respectively. Albany's eighth-
place finish was very close to being
much higher. The Danes 27 points
was just six points behind fifth-place
Cortland.

Two key injuries hurt the Danes‘
chances ofﬁnishing in a higher spot.
Jimmy Pollard turned his ankle in
the trials. and had to be scratched in
the high hurdles.

"Pollard's our scorer in the high
hurdles." commented Munsey. “I
think he would have come in first or
second. and right there we would
have moved up a few places in the
meet."

Also not I00 percent was Dross.
who was performing on an injured
foot. Coach Munsey was forced to
withdraw Dross from the 600—yttrd

  

Spikers Ousted In Semi-finals

 

by Evan Fortlnslty

"On the whole it was a very
positive day." said Albany State
men's volleyball couch Ted Earl.

Ilie Danes played in their first
()pen Tournament in their history at
New l’ttltl. last Saturday and lost in
the semi-finals to Drexel University.
Drexel. who won the tournament.
demolished Livingston College in
the ﬁnals.

This tournament had a round-
robin system. Ten teams were
divided into two groups and the best
squads in each group competed in
the semi-finals. All the matches were
two games of IS points. the team

with the most total points won.

In their first match. the Danes
defeated Maritime College "7-4. I5-
6. Immediately afterwards. the
Duties lost on total points to
Livingston College lO-IS. l6-l4.

Long Layoff

Unfortunately for the Danes. they
had to wait two and one halfhours to
play their next opponent. Playing
against Queens College. the Danes
combined a winning effort IJ-IS. l5-
Ili. This win gave Albany a chance to
play in the semi-finals.

After another long layoff. the
Danes played very poorly against

dash. an event which he excells in.

“Having Dross in the 600 would
have relieved everybody.“ said
-Munsey. “We could have used some
other runners in events which they
are stronger."

A week ago Saturday the Danes
placed second in the ﬁve-school
Capital District Tournament.
Albany finished with more first
places than any other team. but was
outrun by RPI 93—68. with Union
placing third with 55 points.

Although the Danes had
numerous first places. they did not
have many exceptional times or
distances. Of eitception was the
|:l6.5 Dross totaled in the (lilo-yard
dash. A notable performance in the
mile relay of Bill was the only other
impressive time for Albany.

In the long jump. Dross came
through with an unspcctitcular
distance of 22. I75. good enough for
the victory. Dross now has five first-
placcs in seVen meets in the long
jump, establishing him as one of the
main contributors to the team this
season.

The principle reason for the
Danes‘ success might not have been
the participants for Albany. but the
runners who did not participate for
Union. Two national class Union
runners. Bob Moffat and Kevin
Scheuer. were entered in another
tournament. benefitting the Albntiy
cause greatly.

Final meetings with the

candidates will probably be opened
to the SUNYA community. Chesin
said. The search process up to this
point. and all of the more than 200
names considered. has been kept
confidential.

iThis [open hearings] is what search
committees have done in the past.
and I‘d be surprised if they didn‘t
follow that procedure again."Chesin
