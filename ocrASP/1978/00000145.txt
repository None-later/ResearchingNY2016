The Albany State track and ﬁeld
team participated in two
tournaments over the past week. and
cameout with mixed results.

. On Saturday. the squad placed
eighth out of 19 teams in the Union
Invitational.- A week earlier. the
team put together a fine showing in
the Capital District Tournament.
finishing in second place.

Albany met up with some tough
competition in. 'the Union
Invitational. and placing high in any
event was a challenge. The Danes did
manage to come away with a few
victories, primarily due to the
excellence of Bill Mathis.

The ﬂeet sophomore set a school.

indoor redord in the mile run in
4:l6.5. breaking the old record by
more than one second. This gaudy
time was only good enough for third
place in the event. proving the
quality of the other participants.

Mathis‘ heroism did not end with
the mile run. The team of Steve
Kaplan. Erik Shultz. Mathis. and
Sean Reilly blazed through the
distance medley relay.

Reilly crossed the ﬁnish line yards
ahead of any other runner. giving the
Danes their solo first place in‘the
meet. The relay time of I0:26.8 set a
school and ﬁeldhouse record at
Union. bettering by nearly four
seconds the mark set last year by the
Danes.

Leading Albany in the relay was

‘ Mathis. who clocked in It 3:06 in the
three-fourths mile leg.

"He ran a great. three-fourths."

‘stated Albany coach Robert
Munsey. “His time was extremely
fast, and that was where we broke
the race open."‘ '

The most frustrating event of the
meet for Albany was the long jump.
Don Dross led the competition
throughout the entire event. but was

' outdistanced by an RPI jumper on
his last attempt. Dross was beaten by
three-quarters of an inch. but held
on to capture second place for the
Danes.

Union placed ﬁrst in their host
meet, with Plattsburgh and RH
finishing in the second and third
spots, respectively. Albany’s eighth-
place ﬁnish was very close to being
much higher. The Danes 27 points
was just six points behind fifth-place
Cortland.

Two key injuries hurt the Danes‘
chances of finishing in a higher spot.
Jimmy Pollard turned his ankle in
the trials. and had to be scratched in
the high hurdles.

“Pollard's our scorer in the high
hurdles." commented Munsey. “I
think he would have come in ﬁrst or
second, and right there we would
have moved up a few places in the
meet.“

Also not l00 percent was Dross.
who was performing on an injured
foot. Coach Munsey was forced to

i'withdraw Dross from the 600-yard

[have

dash. an event which he excells in.

“Having Dross in the 600 would
relieved everybody," said
Munsey. “We could have used some
other runners in events which they
are stronger.“

A week ago Saturday'the Danes
placed second in the ﬁve-school
Capital District Tournament.
Albany finished with more first
places than any other team. but was
outrun by RP] 93-68. with Union
placing third with 55 points.

Although the Danes had
numerous first places. they did not
have many exceptional times or
distances. 0f exception was the
l:l6.5 Dross totaled in the boo-yard
dash. A notable performance in the
mile relay of 3:3] was the only other
impressive time for Albany.

In the long jump. Dross came
through with an unspectacular
distance of 22.l75. good enough for
the victory. Dross now has five first-
places in seven meets in the long
jump, establishing him as one of the
main contributors to the team this
SCESOD.

The principle reason for the
Danes‘ success might not have been
the participants for Albany. but the
runners who did not participate for
Union. Two national class Union
runners, Bob Moffat and Kevin
Scheuer. were entered in another
tournament. bencﬁtting the Albany
cause greatly.
