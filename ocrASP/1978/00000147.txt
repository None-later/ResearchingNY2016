THE WEEKLY NEWSMAGAZINE

 

A Letter from the Publisher

Well. it looks like it‘s Kick-in—the-ASI’ TIME again. Kick
is a TIME-honored tradition at this universtiy and it signals
a combination of some of the wittiest. funniest. tastless
pieces of bufooncry you will come across each year.

Be it reminded that any relation to anybody living or dead
is purely on purpose. for we wouldn‘t have any fun making

fun of people who don‘t exist. We don‘t like making fun of
dead people either. but in Kick. everybody is fair game.
Read the pages of this magazine with caution. Those who
are easily offended sit down. count to ten. and please don‘t
come into our office with a knife in hand. 'l'hat wouldn‘t he

kosher.

In this issue. we look ior our missing president, we miss
our AM radio station and we make no mistake about our
choice for TIME‘s Man oi the Year.

Enjoy the reading. have a happy spring; if you are a SCnltir.
good luck finding thatjob; if you are a freshman, who cares;
if you are alive. it‘s probably better than the alternative. So
liie life while your here. die death while your there. and it]
between. curl up on the podriirn and listen to that guy playing
the gurtar as this maga/ine hopefully brightens your
otherwise hun-drum SUNYA existence.

Rah-Rah!

In reference to your article on
SUNY Chancellor Clifton Horton‘s
plan to build a football stadium at
SUNYA. I think it is a great idea..l
knew that once the football season
came around, 01‘ Cliff would start
getting homesick for Michigan
State and their huge program.
imagine. the Great Danes playing
in front of 35.000 screaming fans in
the SUNYA stadiuml And who says
we didn't need a. fieldhousel

Distribute It Around
On behalf of the For
Undergraduate Curriculum
Knowledge committee. better
known as F.U.C.K.. i would like to
say a. few things. We are not
advocating distribution
requirements where the students
Will have to take a course out of
their major that they are not
interested in. We are advocatingthe
recruitment of students who are
interested in everything. ’l‘hen we‘d
have an idea. university
environment—student could take
all kinds of neat courses. even
accounting. The tentative
distribution requirement plan has
you rolling a pair of dice for your
out-of-major requirements. if you
are a math major. a seven will get
you English comp. if you are an
English major. asoven will get you
a math teacherto help you count the
numbers on the dice. if you are an
accounting major. you are probably
too boring to deal with anyway.
Roll an eleven if you‘re a psych
major and you can get an instant
sun tan. If you are minoring in
Chinese. an eight on the dice will

get you an eggroll.
Now that's what a

student is all about.

We talked to your letters pttgc

and followed him around. but he
