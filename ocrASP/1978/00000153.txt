Public Admlnlstratlon faculty member Robert Quinn describes three
types of motives for ottlce romances: Job, ego and love.

 

 

 

bySussn Desrstyre

Office romances are amusing and
harmless. right? Not so. accordingto
a study published recently by
SUNYA Public Administration
faculty member Robert Quinn.
Quinn asserts. in his study, that such
relationships are both more
common and more destruetive than
is commonly believed.

Quinn said his research is just
"groundbreaking" and emphasized
that it only scratches the surface in
tin urea not seriously studied before.

Dr. Quinn‘s study. based on 2”
questionnaires completed by people
waiting in the Albany and
l.tl(iuill‘(llll Airports. shows that Lit)
of the 2H respondents knew of ill
lcnst ottc romnntic relationship
between two members of the slime
business organization.

   
 

Quinn said he bacame interested
in this subject because he once
worked for a while in a place Where
all ofﬁce romance was having a bad
impact.

The study was carried out in two
phases. Phase one involved
gathering information and
preparing the questionnaire. In
Phase two the questionnaire was
circulated. the results tabulated. and
the dynamics of the phenomenon
aiitilyircd.

Quinn describes three types of
motives for romance: Job. ego. and
love.

“Despite efforts to keep a
relationship secret. participants
often fail.“ siiys Quinn. In some cases
he studied. the tipol'fs were blatant.
participants were seen “embracing in
closets. kissing in supply rooms. or

‘g‘ lot.”_WlIen a
romance becomesemb’arassing it is
usually the‘female who is asked to
leave. he said." -‘ " . ’

The findings‘of his project indicate
that the proximity of-the‘employees
is a major factor in the deVelopment
of romantic relationships in
organisations. When people are in
constant contact in the same small
ofﬁce. a friendship often develops
which after several months. may.
turn into romantic involvement.
Quinn said the survey revealed than
in some ofﬁces. “it was expected that
when you hired a secretary you
weren‘t looking for a typist. In fact.
hardly anyone hired could type.“

Most efforts to keep such
relationships secret fail and the
"establishment and visibility of one
relationship can lead to the public
emergence of others.“ Quinn said.

Quinn said that he was not able to
get access to private organization in
order to do his research because
"people are threatened by the
questionnairs.“

As at result of romantic
involvements. Quinn said. office
perforﬁance changes. sometimes for
the better. but sometimes for the
worse. Those involved often begin
making costly errors and wasting
time. ln-fighting among the
employees sometimes leads to a
situation were employees do little
but gossip.

According to Dr. Quinn. the study
"isn‘t suited for the generation 01
principles or guidelines. but pro\idcs
at greater understanding of a
phenomenon with which one may
lime to deal."
