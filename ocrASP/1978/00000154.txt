In an effort to alleviate
overcrowding in some gym facilities,
an identiﬁcation tag policy has been
established at the Physical
Education Building.

Anyone desiring to use the main
gyms, the weight room, or the
swimming pool will now be required
to turn in a valid SUNYA ID. card
or guest pass to the equipment issue
room. In ret rn, an identification
tag. worn around the wrist. will be
given.

“We have too many non-
University people using the gym.“
Recreation Coordinator Jackie
Gillis said. Gillis, along with Dr.
Edith Cobane of the Physical
Education Department. organized
the plan. "Students aren't getting
enough ofa chance to use the gym."
Gillis said.

 

An activity supervisor and two
recreation assistants will enforce the
policy at the main gyms and weight
rooms. A tag is necessary during all
ﬁtness and recreational swimhours.

"On‘e‘ of the assistants will be going
around constantly." said Gillis.
“Anyone who doesn‘t have a tag will
be asked to get one or leave." Gillis
sees the tag system as a "minor
inconvenience" to S UNY A students.

When asked about non-University
personnel who are using the
facilities, Gillis replied, "I really
don't know who they are. I‘d say
from what I‘ve been told they are
high school students and other
college students from the area."

Legal Liability
Gillis expressed some concern
about legal liability ifa person who
does not belong in the building is
hurt. “Ultimately the State

 
   

   Established  § 

University is responsible,"rlte slid.
Gillis said she hasn't’yet received
any negative commentlon the new

plan, but noted that “If I getslot of V

negative feedback we may change
some aspect of it. I am open for
suggestions.”

The policy permits one guest per
l.D . holder, Who must be present in
order for the guest to receive a tag.
Tags are not required when
participating with a scheduled
organized group.

If a tag is lost. a replacement fee of
31.00 will be charged. An ID. will be
returned only upon payment of the
ﬁne.

“If a person outside of the
University ﬁnds out that in order to
use the gym you need an ID card, we
hope they will not come over as
much or not come over at all," said
Gillis.
