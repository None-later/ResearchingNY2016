” The March |4th edition of the ASP was a
typical example of institutional racism and the
lack of sensitivity. so prevalent in American
mass-media. A “positive” ‘story on the
reorganization ofthe Albany State University
Black Alliance appeared on page four. whilea
“negative” story about an alleged black crime
suspect was placed on page one. Adding insult
to injury was the police drawing ofthe alleged
suspect which displayed facial features
applicable to an overwhelming number of
Black people. i.e.. abroad nose. thick lips and
dark skin.

Undoubtedly the decision to placethc crime
story on page one and the ASUBA story on
page four was not the act of an individual
racist. Such a decision most likely reﬂects the
basic operating practices of American
journalism which arbitrarily decides that a
crime story is more “news worthy" than a
fat irable story about Black students.
Historically American mass-media. as an
institution. has highlighted negative and
unfavorable images of Black people.
reinforcing the racist stereotypes that have
plagued the white psyche for centuries.

Institutional racism (racism which results
from the following of standard institutional
procedures) is less identiﬁable and far more
subtle than blatant individual racist acts;
however it is equally as insidious and
damaging. When Black people protest such
institutional practices we are accused of
advocating a double standard. an accusation
synonymous with being “nu-American." (The
Allan Bakke case can he hicwcd as the same
do'ublc standard. tin-amcrican attack in
education as an insittition.) For white
Americans to accuse Third World people of
advocating a double standard is historical
hypocrisy. For centuries they have used
double standards (such as the Black Codes.
Jim Crow laws and grandfather clauses) to
beneﬁt themselves.

Many of us have come to the conclusion
that white racism (be it innate or
environmentally induced) is entrenched in
American institutions. Since white Americans
benefit frorn racism they cannot be expected
to alleviate it. The remedy is not the hoped for
awakening of a new sensitivity on the part of
white Americans. What is required are
alternative Black institutions that will address
our needs. If Black people are to stop being
depicted as criminals or pathological citizens
by the mass-media. we must control otir own
means of communication in this country and
on this campus.

 

 

 

 

 

  
 
  
    

   

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

     
 

The aforementioned ASP article is not an
isolated incident. There are numerous other
examples of subtle racism on this camptis. For
instance:

— There are faculty members in variotis
departments who openly admit in their
classrooms that they believe Black people to
be intellectually inferior to whites. Such
professors are protected by the institutional
practice of “academic freedom."

--— The white reaction to the Educational
Opportunity Program has had racist
overtones since the program‘s inception. The
campus publication entitled Viewpoint, a
publication intended to acquaint incoming
freshmen with the various activities on the
campus states the following: “The
Educational Opportunity I’rogram(EOP) has
the ambitious goal of taking people who
cannot meet SUNYA‘s admission standards
and are unable to afford a college edtication
and. by giving them special help over the
rough spots. turning them inru college
graduates" (emphasis added). Accompanying
the dubious wording is a photograph of a
Black student. No where in the article are the
signiﬁcant number of white students on EOP
mentioned. Noris it mentioned that SUNYA‘s
admission standards are arbitrary and
superﬁcial. Many EOP students who have
come to SUNYA with less than "acceptable"
averages have graduated Cum Laude.

- WCDB. the school radio station.
arbitrarily decided to cater to the majority (i.e.
whites) of their potential listening audience.
an audience already being catered to by 99.9%
of the commercial and non-commercial
stations in the area. The fact that their
audience could benefit from extensive

expostrrc to Black ttnd Latin music escapes

thetn.

The SUNYA yearbook will probably not
reﬂect the experiences of Iiltick attd Ptrerto
Rican students since there are no Third World
students on its staff. In addition. there will
probably be a limited number of Iilaclt images
(i.c. photographs of Black people) in tltc
yearbook since this year‘s Photo-Sen ice staff
is exclusively while.

We reiterate that the present situation is not
necessarily the work oi individual racists. The
people involved are simply follmvingstanditrd
institutional practices resulting iii“business as
usual.“ I hey are for the most part oblivious to
the greater dynamics rrirolvcd.

As the victims of such insensitivity the
burden falls upon us as Ihird World students
to voice otir concerns and demand redress.
Rest assured that we rctilr/e our tasks and will
pursue them in the future must earnestly and
by any means necessary.

To the Editor: I
The Palace Theatre in downtown Albany is
an extremely busy concert hall. At any one
show over 3.000 people come through the
doors looking for some fun and
entertainment. We. the employees of the
Palace. want you. the concertgocr. to have
that fun and entertainment. but not at the
expense of others. That‘s why we search
people its they come in the theatre. We are not
trying to takeaway your boo/e so you‘ll have a
lousy time. What we are looking for are
potential weapons such as chains and knives.
Unfortunately. bottles and cans (even those
containing soda) also fall into this category. A
well-aimed can or bottle can hurt. maiin or
possibly kill. Therefore. we take away your
bottles and cans and throw them out.

This does not mean that you can‘t bringany
alcoholic beverages into the theatre. You may
bring liquor iii milk cartons. light plastic
containers. wine skins or anything other than
glass. metal or hard plastic containers.

If you do not want to submit to a search you
don‘t have to. but you won't be able to iittend
the concert. We don‘t want you at the Palace if
you will not be considerate of your fellow
concertgoers. We want everyone to have an
enjoyable time. as well as a safe time.

To the Editor:

We would like to bring to the attention of
the University community an act of
discrimination against the telltale members of
the University Chorale by its director. Mr.
Don I-Iaincs (iuidotti.

For the forthcoming concert. costume kits
to be self-constructed. were ordered for
Chorale members. Subsequently. it was
discovered that there was extra money
rcmairiing in the costume htltlgct. I'Ite

\director. Mr. I). II. (itiidolti. took it upon

himself to haVe the men‘s costumes put
together at‘the factory with the remaining
money. -

As a result; only the women are required to
sew a costume in order to sing inthc concert.

This blatant’disoriminatory action shows
thoughtlessness and ti complete lack of Icspect
on the part of Mr. I). ll, (irudotti.
Unfortunately, Mr. (itiidotti is tiltlnltitts tn

perfected the technique in the wake
of reports that largcquantities of pot
contaminated by the poisonous
herbicide are being smuggled into
the United States from Mexico.

whenever the economy improved

students‘ grade-point averages shot
up again.

A leading British astronomer is
suggestingthat one ofthe mysterious
“black holes“ is lurking at the very
center of our Milky Way galaxy.

Dr. .Iirn Pringle ofthe Institute of
Astronomy at Cambridge says that
apparent discrepancies in the orbital
paths of nearby stars can be
explained by the presence of ti
riiassivc. invisible body at the
galactic ccntcr.

Dr. I‘ringlc told the Royal

that the im isrhlc "black holc" could

NAP TIME

if you want to improve your
grades in school. you‘d better plttrt to
IitkL‘ a nap.

Researchers at the University of
Colorado report that a six-year
study has found that “a sleep break"
between study time rind the taking of
an exam improves a student‘s ability
to recall facts.

Doctor Iirucc likhll‘tllltl says he
has discovered sleeping helps reduce
Iorgcttiug because it slows down the
memory "decay rate." Ekstrarid says
that sleeping prior to studying
doesn't ltclp. nor does napping after
the exam is over.Sleepingonly helps

between the study session arid the
test.

HIGH PRIORITY

The New York Department of
Mental Hygiene has circulated a
three-page illustrated memorandum
instructing its employees on the
state-approved way to split an
English muffin iti half.

That tiienio states: Sincetltc Iypc
of cut (fork-pried versus knife-
sliced) significantly affects the ﬂavor
rind the texture of the toasted
product. we recommend the fork
cut."

The memo alleges that the "fork-
Fried". in its words. "provides the
peaks and valley symmetry
necessary to lot' maximum l'laior
and texture." It tltcn tells state
nittllitt preparers to "insert the
splitter rrito the side (of the muffin)
so that the second crit is_
perpendicular to the first cut.“

Nutrition Director .litck Bellick
says the memo was circulated to
insure that state muffin—splitters will
work fast. yet split the mufﬁns the
proper way.
