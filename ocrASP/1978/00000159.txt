Bill Falcon
By DENNIS SCHEYER

here is a multitude of Bruce

Springsteen sound-alikes

performing direct copies of

the boss‘ inimitable style.

Now you‘re saying how can
they imitate the inimitable. Well. this is
my point. they can‘t. But. if some
enjoyable music comes out of Mr.
Spingsteen's inspiration. then more
power to the imitators.

Billy Faleoms Burning Rose is an
extremely pleasant album. At times it
rocks with the best ofthem. at others it is
sensuously mellow.

The band members are all credible.
Falcon admitted in concert a few weeks
ago at Page Hall that he didn't play guitar
very well. but his vocals are powerful and
he is really into the music he has written.
The rest of the band consists of Michael
Visaggio on keyboards and flute. Ricky
Zollo on lead guitar. Billy Milne on
drums and Glenn Eichlcr on bass and
harmonica.

As to the songs. the lyrics are in the true
Springsteen form. “Friday Night” begins
with a catchy organ riff (reminiscent of
Southside Johnny's "l'lie Fever“) and
rolls into a good 01' rock and roll beat.
Play it for someone and tell them it’s
"Rosalita" and for a second you might
fool them.

"Boys and Girls" features lyrics such as
Well f/i‘l’illl ll'rllt't' up Imnorrou' morning
and calf! ft’lllt‘IH/lt'l’ what you did. Just
ring up .i'ourfriumh and/ind out ho ir lUlt'
you slid! Realities I guess.

This all adds up to a decent album.

them a break. They are fun in concert. As
to buying this album. use your
judgement. It might beii pacil‘iei‘sincethe

0 you like hard driving
raunchy iock ‘n roll'.’ Well if
you do then you might as well
skip the rest of this review
because this album is not for
you. The Album by Abba is a collection
of musically uninteresting melodies with
repititious rhythms. This combination

Abba. I am told. is a popular band in
Europe and has only been recently
introduced into the US. market. They are
basically a vocal group with both male
and female vocals’although I ﬁnd that the
female vocals predominate.

“The Name of the Game“, the “hit sin-
gle" on this album is similar in many
respects to every other tune on the album
in that it is based on a simple melody with
a constant repetitive rhythm that goes
nowhere. i don‘t find the lyrics to be
particularly profound and overall don‘t
see much to the song.

“Thank You for the Music“ has the
potential to be fine muzak (it should be
renamed “Thank You for the Muzak") or
background music in a movie soundtrack
but as an artistic piecejust doesn‘t make
it. Of course it is difficult to predict how
the conditioning forces in our society
work. even if you area behaviorist. so it is
possible that this song may become the.
number one hit ol l978 which wouldjust
rellect how sad our society is today.

The tune "I Wonder" is in line with
somethind The Carpenters would do. The
female vocalist‘s voice sounds like a cross
between Barbara Streisand and Judy
Garland with an accent. The words to this
song. exemplified by Myfriemls will get
married/have children and hurries/II
suiimA'ionice. . . back conformity and a
move to contentness and security. both
necessary ideals in a controlled society.

Upon first listening to the lyrics ofthis
album I thought that this album might be
a form of social criticism. instead. I find it
totally influenced by the society it would
have critici/ed. “l‘in a Marionette"
though outwardly seeming to be
commenting on control in our society
actually seems to be udmcating it with
such insightful lyrics as And I'm like a
(loll/like a puppy! it'll/l no will (11 all. . .
)("an'i t‘Ulll/Illllll/ I got no Ullt‘ but iiiizii'l/
io blulllt’.

Overall. I think that 'llic .‘l/llullt sums

t is a well known fact that
today‘s new recording artist
has to light an uphill battle in
order to be heard and taken
seriously. if he main reason lor
this is the ever tightening pliiylists used by
radio stations. compounded by the vast
amount of new products which glut the
market weekly. So. the artist must strike
the balance between being creative and
yet still remain commercially viable. '1 his
is exactly what Jimmie Mack has

accomplished with his first effort.
'Jimmie is no neophyte to the business
ot making good music. he is a veteran of
"The Earl Slick Band," which released
two solid yet unsuccessful albums in the
last two years. It is with this new album
that Jimmie lives up to his potential as a
songwriter and singer which he showed

with the “Stick Band.“ The album is well J

H album» consists of ten songs all
pop by Mack except for.“Dreams"
which was cowritten by Jimmie's present
in player, Gene Leppik. Two of the
songs are well arranged and light hearted
and are entitled “There Was Love," and
“Hold On"; these were both written in a
more commercial vein, and both have

> single potential. “Bump In the Night" is a

hard rocker which is quite reminiscent of

' some of the better material found in the

“Humble Pie" genre. My two favorite
tunes are the tasteful upbeat rocker
“Waiting for Tonight," and the
dynamically surprising “Sidcstreet Girl.“
both of which feature the fine keyboard
work of Greg Deppe.

All in all the album is certainly a well
worked out and worthy effort. The
arrangements are excellent for the idiom

such city. Locri in southern Italy. even
kept the kappa along with the horse.
although its own initial letter was L (the
issuing city was identified on the reverse

prosperity are reflected in its coinage, as is
the loss of prosperity. or even of freedom.
Often the coinage tells us what otherwise
we would not know

Another famous issue was that of
Athens. which featured a head ol Athena

other. Athens too traded a great deal.

Musically, the players all stand out,

familiar with his Stick period. being most
tastefully arranged in both the heavier
and lighter moments.

The truly outstanding musical feature
of the album are the vocals. The group is
gifted in that all four members of the
group can sing and four-part harmonies
are prevalent throughout. The high

phrasing and vocal quality are perfect for
