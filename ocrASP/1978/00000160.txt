a great deal cf‘inrcngth. perseverance and

quoted extensively in your first article on the

It is important to note that Dr. Ross bad the
support of the majority of the SAU faculty in
these efforts and ventures.

The situation involving CAFE was one

administrative procedures. protection of the

To the Editor:

In yotireditor'iai at March .1 on tliedeadliiie
concerning |‘)7ti-77 ttiilioii-assisttiticc
inquiries. you suggest that lliglter I‘.(Illt.‘illltilt
Services Corp. means to slitit the door on
awards to deserving students. Not so. And I
emphasize l‘)7(>-77. because your editorial
through some apparent processing error
describes the deadline as applying to l977-7ti
cases. Also not so. and I wish you luck lll
trying to titine your typesetting computer.

The deadline means that we need to hear
from 1976-77 applicitlilti by April IS. l‘)7tt.
Those who are heard from by that date it l3-
ccnt stamp and a few minutes tiriie will get

3'thcmlpast. our dread drawgate - will bej
‘ considered for as long as it takes to either deny

or award thcma payment.

We see this as reasonable and necessary in
order to confine the work of this corporation
to its statutory territory A i.e.. to assure that
l-IESC operations will not. in the latter part of
this century or the early part of the 2lst
century. cross liries with the work of sister
elements of governineat such as the New York
State Office lor the Aging. and the federal old
age and survivors insurance system.

An Act To Farrow?“

Ah, spring. A time for the weather to get warmer, frisbees and
softballs to emerge. for people to return to the podium.'Spring is a .
time of rebirth. And in that spirit, Student Association will be holding
a meeting next week to discuss the restoration of an evaluation of
faculty members by students.

This campus used to have such a program ——i it was called The
Assessment of Courses and Teachers (ACT) and it has died and been
resurrected more than any Biblical Characters.

An assessment of faculty members printed in a booklet for all to see
serves many purposes. First, it alerts studentstothe best teachers and
gives teachers an awareness of how they are seen in the eyes of the
students. It also shows the student‘s' evaluation of the particular
strong and weak points of the faculty member.

At this university. faculty members are expected to maintain
excellence in their respective field. This means that they are expected
to show everyone that they are on top of matters in their field by
conducting research and/or publishing.

Faculty members should also be expected to maintain excellence in
teaching. The only truly accurate assessment of whether faculty
members have maintained this excellence can be obtained by the
students. The students are the ones who interact with the faculty
members; they are the ones who can evaluate the teaching
performances. The possibility of a negative rating published campus-
wide may just be the added incentive for a professor to devote a little
more time to the students — or at least as much time as he or she is
devoting to getting published.

Tenure is another factor. Currently, there is no student
participation on tenure decisions at this university. While meeting
with a number of SUNYA students this week, SUNY Chancellor
Clifton Wharton was non-commital on the issue of student
participation in tenure evaluations, preferring to leave it up to the
individual institutions. A student publication ratingthe performance
of faculty members can only add credibility to the argument that
students should be involved in the tenure process.

The fact that there is movement toward the rebirth of such a
publication is encouraging. It is hoped that a study will be made to
look into the problems that have been experienced in the past and
how to avoid keeping such an endeavor alive. In short. SA should get
this AC’l' together permanently.
