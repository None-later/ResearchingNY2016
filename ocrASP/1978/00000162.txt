The Student Affairs Council of the
University Senate has six standard
subcommittees. one of which is primarily a
policy-reviewing and policy-interpreting
body. and serves as on appeal body for student
grievances regarding the decisions concerning
student aid packages. The Committee assists
the Director of Financial Aids in establishing
operational policies for the office of financial
aids. Included are representatives from the
admissions office. E.O.P., Student Accounts.
undergraduate and graduate students.
housing office. and the Director of Financial
Aids.

The Financial Aids Committee has
reviewed and cleriftcd some of the recent
policies and program changes which affect
students applying for financial aid.
Concerning the Health Fcc issue. the
Financial Aids Office did incrciisc each aid
package proportionally to cover the
mandatory for. so that students receiving illd
were not forced to. personally pin the lac.

As set by the Financial Aids Committee nnd
Ol'l‘lcc. April I5 is the deadline for l97ll-79
ﬁnancial aid applications, and April Zti is the
deadline for Summer I978 applications. This
allows the Financial Aids Office enough time
to process the forms. Note that the Financial
Aid Form now replaces the Parents
Conﬁdential Statement. and must he ﬁled
with the College Scholarship Service. The
F.A.F. includes the application process for
BEOG. so that is separate farm for BEOG is
not needed. unless you are only applying for
BEOG.

The Committee reviewed the automobile
policy. and it was determined that studcnts
operating automobiles will provided with

 

Elli/(Iris Now: .Ierry Mlllu/i’lhtllllll i.\ (hair a]
Iirr' Serra/cit Slur/ml Ajjirirx ('mrunillvv.

 

 

  
 
 

standard budgets and will have standard self-
support expectations madc of them. The
expenses associated with operating
automobiles will be accepted as part of the
studcnt‘s budget only when such can be
constdcrcd an educational necessity. The
Committec also examined the issue of
emancipation and formulated the policy that
students applying for independent
(cmttnmputcd) status for purposes ofrecciving
zud. must meet state and federal criteria for
cmunctputton and must demonstrate clearly
thiit they have fully supported themselves for a
full your previous to their application,
generally through is break in education.
Students filing the C.S.S. Financial Aid Form
are required to submit all parental data
rcqucstcd unless they have been previously
dctcrmlncd to be independent by the Office of
l-rnuncial Aids.

.Anothcr policy enacted by the Financial
Aids Committee involves the return receipt on

 

   

columns

the school application. This notiﬁes students
that the Financial Aide Ofﬁce has received
their old applications, and elso'stetes if there is
a problem with the application. The student
can then rectify thcproblem immediately. The
Committee also implemented the process of
sending a second award letter within the stated
period of time.
With regard to TAP, certain points must be
noted. April l5 is the deadline for HESC
inquiries dealing with a l976-77 TAP award.
and May Is is the deadline for HESCinquirics
dealing with the l977-78 award. The HESC
will mail a copy of the l978-79 TAI’
application to your home if you are currently
receiving TAP monies. and the application
will be available in April. Finally. an
important TAP policy is the SIOO reduction
rule. If you are an upperclsssman, the HESC
will automatically reduce your award by Sl00
per semester.

Anything that involves the issuance of the
