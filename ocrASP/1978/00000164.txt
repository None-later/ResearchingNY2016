teams premier L long-ball hitters. '

Mirabella also posesses a gun for an
arm behind‘the plate. '

Another position that appears set
is shortstop, where Grimaidi is the
defensive key. Frontrunners for the
outﬁeld spots are Plantier. Nelson,
and Howie Markowitz. All three
have excellent range and strong
arms.

“The other inﬁeld positions are
still open," added Burlingame. "The
fall didn't prove much. Nobody topk
advantage of their opportunities to
nail down a position.“

Leading contenders for the
available infield spots are Siegier,
‘ ony Lenkiewicz. and Buz
MulQucen. Sicgier is the teams‘
“Mr. Versatility.“ and can play any
inﬁeld position. Bruce Kaczmarck is
the top contestant for ﬁrst base. and
his lefty bat does not hurt his
chances. Transfer student Larry
Scorzillo has experience from local
semi-pro leagues. and has looked
impressive in workouts.

Adding to the Duncs‘ problems.
the spring schedule is tougher than
the falls. Albany plays eight games
against Division land ll opponents.

and play only six games with
conference rivals.

"The schedule is deﬁnitely
weighed against us in the second half
of the season." said Burlingame.

“This year we have one of the '

toughest schedules we‘ve ever had."

All but eliminated from the
playoffs, and facing a difﬁcult
schedule. the Danes are not exactly
going into the spring season under
the best possible circumstances. if
the hitting comes around, the Danes
could salvage something from a
bleak season. if not. well there's
always next year.

 

on the
right track....

i feel that the policy will be successful in that it may rnakelocal kids think
twice abom coming .here to get their physical activity. But if they do deeideto
come here and play. what will stop them from ignoring the issue room and the
tart and go directly to the‘gym and start playing basketball?

And let‘s say that a recreation assistant sees someone without a tag. what will
he/she do if the offender of the rule is 6’5" and 200 pounds. As Gillis herself
points out, “it will be tougher to enforce to people who are bigger.”

As | see it now, most,measures to prevent this misuse of gym facilities will
not be too successful, either.

1 suggested to Gillis the procedure they had here two years ago, which
would not be as inconvenient to University members. who now have to wait
on line to get tags, wear them when they're participating, and pay a
replacement fee of one dollar if they lose the tag.

Two years ago, one assistant checked l.D.'s at the front entrance of the
building, while one checked them at the back of the building. No up. No
replacement fee.

Gillis said this system would double their cost. This is so because two
additional people must be ableto move around the buildingand notjust sit in
one spot. according to Gillis. l was also told that peopleentered through the
locker room, and pried other doors open.

There is no doubt that this is a serious problem that has to be dealt with.
My ﬁnal thought to Gillis was,“Can't security press charges of trespassing
against the offenders who come here?“ Her reply: “The security force
considers this our internal problem, and we should take care of it ourselves.
They‘re really not very willing to help us out.”

Why not? It could be more proﬁtable than issuing parking tickets.
