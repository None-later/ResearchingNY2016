Coming off their worst fall season
in. many years. the Albany State
varsity baseball team can only go in
one direction this spring; upwards.

The dismal fall record tells’the
storyz’J-M-l and virtually out ofthc
running in the SUNYAC
conference; ',

“we didn't quite put it together in
the fall.” understated Dane baseball
coach Bob Burlingamc. "We have to
improve in certain areas in order to
get over the hurdle.“

Getting over the hurdle cannot be
accomplished until one area is
drastically improved. The Danes
simply could not hit with any
consistency in the fall. and this
problem could make for a long
spring.

Only a handful of players had
notable achievements at the plate.
and even these performances could
hardly be labeled outstanding.

Rich Cardillo was the leading
Albany batter with a .3lti average
and nine runs batted in. Joining the
Dane catcher in the .300 circle was
team co-captain Roger l’lantier.
who contributed by chalking up a
.3l3 average and six RBI‘s.

belonging to co-captnin Al
Grimaldi. who also knocked across
six runs. Other Danes who helped
the cause were I’aul Nelson and
Chris Siegler. both drawing ll
walks.

“Our hitting has got to improve.“
commented Burlingamc. “We have
to find some sticks.“

The lack of a steady clutch hitter
prevented Albany from a respectable
ﬁrst half of the I977-78 season. In
their six conference defeats. the
Danes lost live games by one run.
One more hit in each of those games.
and the ’ playoffs would be a
possibility.

In the fall. the Danes posted a 3-6-
1 record in conference pltiy. which
breaks down in the point system to
one lonely point. By comparison.
Binghamton and Oneonta are tied
for first place with ll points. ptttting
Albany almost out of sight in the
standings. which carry over into the
spring season.

“ We‘rejust about eliminated as far
as the conference goes." admitted
Burlingame. “All we cart do istry to
improve in the spring.“ I

Pitching is one department that
cannot be faulted. Led by
sophomore Steve Mttldoon. the
Danes have the potential for an
excellent pitching staff. No liurler
had an impressive record. but this
was due to lack of hitting support'

Mike Motto: An Unusual Coac

by Eddie Emermon

if you were watching the Albany
State lacrosse team practicing. you
might have a difﬁcult time picking
out the head coach.

Many coaches are thought as the
rough 'n tough-type characters.
They stand on the sidelines at if they
have a whip in their hands. They are
usually easy to identify just by their
appearance; sometimes tall and
impressive looking and sometimes
older looking.

Different Coach

But Mike Motla is different.
Motto begins his second campaign
tomorrow at the head coach of the
lacrouc squad. Last year. his first
one ever in a head coach. his team

finished with a respectable 6-6
record.

Why is Motla different from the
other coaches? Just a quick look at
him will tell you.

He doesn't have that imposing.
dominant character. And at 25 years
old he Just about fits in with the
members of the team.

Motta feels this is a plus for him.
“I am not that far removed from the
players." Motta said. “I can relate to
them and it can makcthingit easier."

Winning is. of course. what all
coaches want most ofall. But Motttt
believes there is more to winning. “1
love working with these kids and
watching them develop. it's a little
bit more motivating.“

Motla il not it stranger to the
Albany area. He attended Albany
State part-time until he received his
bachelor's degree in Physical

Education. However. he was not
able to play on the school lacrosse
team because of his part-time status.
He played instead for the Mohawk
Valley Lacrosse Club.

Master's Degree

Motla received his Master‘s
Degree two years ago at Ithaca
College and then returned to
Albany.

When the lacrosse season doesn't
keep him busy. the administration
does. In addition to being an
assistant coach to the varsity
football team. Motla also teaches
physical education courses. Among
his classes are tennis. yoga.
raquetbtill. coaching techniques and
naturally. lacrosse.

“I‘m kept pretty busy." said
Motta. “But lenjoy whatI‘m doing."

Goalkeeping could be a problem if
Miller gets injured because Motla
said at this time. there isn‘t a back-up

goalie.
l'hc defensive standout is Mike
Dinet. also a returnce. Dinct has

been selected its one ofthrcc captains

"We've come up with this possible solution. We‘re not saying it‘s going to
cure the probleni.“-says Recreation Coordinator Jackie Gillis. concerning the
identification tug policy that went into effect Monday.

The policy states that a "valid SUNYA |.D. card or valid guest pass must
be turned iii to the issue room in order to receive an ID. tag. Any person not
wearing [a tag] will be asked to obtain one or leave the building.“

This new procedure applies to three athletic facilities: the main gyms. the

swimming pool and the weight rootn.

As co—organiter with Dr. Edith Cobane. (iillis should be complimented for
attacking the dilemma of overcrowded athletic facilities.
However. Gillis‘ solution ofthc problem. as she readily admits. might not

work.

There are two reasons forthe overcrowding. One is thclack offloor space;
the second is that people outside of the University are tising the facilities.
Obviously. Gillis could not have tried to solve the first problem ‘that was
up to the students of this school last year when they voted down a referendum

for the construction of a fieldhousc.

But Gillis has tried to solve the second problem of how to stop area high
school and college students from making the Physical Education Building

their playground.

Their only entrance to the building should be as spectators. and not as
active participants. Not only does their involvement result in the
overcrowding of the facilities. but it also restricts the am0unt of time that
students. faculty and staff can make use ofthc basketball courts. swimming

pool. or weight room.

v'o'i. w. No. 16

by Jon Lafayette .

The New York State
Legislature last week
approved a. TAP increase
which will benefit SUNY
students. but retained the
controversial student health
fee. as it concluded
negotiations and passed the
State Purposes Budget for
1978-79.

The Assembly and Senate
however. deadlocked over the
issue of medicaid funding of
abortions. could not agree on
the seven million dollar Local
Assistance Budget. which
includes welfare funds as well
as elementary and secondary
school aid.

The compromise on TAP aid
was reached after student
dissatisfaction with the
Governor‘s increase package.

abuses at. SUNYA as well as
SUNY-wide. The document
was prepared after months of
investigation by the
committee.

One question to be asked is:
what were the effects of the
1976 retrenchmenta on
students in the SUNY system?
But perhaps even more
important. with the majority
ofthc Higher Education report
being devoted to charges of
abuse at SUNYA: what have

the compromise “a. more

Following lab inspections, Professor David Holmes is one of two

states. “Complaints ranged
from undue hosts and

Testimony before the

Art History Department was

award from $100 to $200; and
extends maximum TAP
coverage to students whose
families have an income of
$2.700 an increase upon last
year's $2000 limit.

The legislature also voted to
remove TAP eligibility for
students who have defaulted
on student loans: institute new
and stricter accounting and
management procedures; and
limit coverage to one
certificate or degree program
at each educational level. The
new guideline means that only
one B.A. or Associates Degree
can be earned with TAP
funding. unlike the current
policy which provides for
eight semester‘s coverage
regardless of the program a
student is enrolled in.

DNA Facility Gets Certiﬁcation

by G. Pascal Zachary

The certification of the
Biology department's new
laboratory has paved the way
for further experimentation
with the controversial gene-
splicing technique. used in
recombinant DNA research.

The Bio-Hazards
committee. a university body
regulating SUNYA research
and an official from the State
Department of Health found
that the facility was “more
than in complianco with the
federal guidelines.“ The nine
member committee inspected
the facility on Mar. 9.

Research involving gene-
splicing must be conducted

according to Schntidt.

A member of the Speech
Pathology Department
testified before the committee
that as early as 1971 the
department members were
informed that dissension
within the faculty could lead
to its termination. The Task
Force on Priorities and
Resources did in fact cite
"lack of cooperation between
faculty members" as a reason
for retrenchment.

On Astronomy. the
committee was told by a.
former professor that his
position was terminated "only
after a dispute about the
application for a federal
grant.“

Finally. the committee
report touched on tho
retrenchment of the

out precautionary measures
that must be taken to insure
physical containment of the
organisms used in the
experiments. Guideline levels
of containment range from p-

highest. The Biology
