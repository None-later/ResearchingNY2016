only a handful fo those 200 Will
publicly be recognized as
members of the organization.
They will not go public
because of fear for their jobs.

These faculty have seen
their collcaugues retrenched
in what they consider to be
unethical ways. They see the
fact that Curtis Hemenway
lost his position in Astronomy
after a disagreement with the
administration over a
research grant as more than a
coincidence.

They also see the
retrenchment of the
Comparative Literature_
Department. at the same time
that Judith Leibowitz was
filing suits against two
SUNYA Presidents. a Vice
President. and numerous
other SUNYA personnel. as
more than a coincidence.

These faculty view the
retrenchment of those two
departments as well as Speecii
Pathology and Art History. as
a deliberate attempt to get rid
ot faculty who openly
disagreed with the
administration. In their
minds. academic consid-
erations weighed very little
in any of the retren-

chment decisions.

What does this mean to the
average SUNYA student? It
means that many of their
professors are working in an
atmosphere of fear. in a
setting where freedom of
expression is supposedly
encouraged.

it means that potential new
faculty are reluctant to accept
jobs at this university. with
the American Association of
United Professors voting to
censure the SUNY system for
its retrenchment practices.
and SUNYA the scene of most
of the complaints. many of the
big names in academics are
staying away.

It means that many viable
departments were terminated
at a time when the SUNY
system faced a no growth
budget. not budget cuts. In the
SUNY system. 82 tenured
faculty had their positions
eliminated 32 at SUNYA. At
the same time. the City
University was faced with
severe budget cuts. and
rctrenched no tenured faculty.

It means that whether the
charges are trite or not.
SUNYA students are
attending a school with a
national reputation as having
retrenched departments on the
basis of conflicting
personalities between faculty
and administration.

What it comes down to is
that SUNYA students have
become the victims. not the
beneficiaries of "selective"
retrenchment. Perhaps
departments did have to be
eliminated for budgetary
reasons. But when the process
in making the retrenchment
decisions prompts a
legislative inquiry and the
prospect of legislation being
enacted to control and alter
this process.can anyone in the
SUNYA community honestly
say that nothing happened?

SUNYA housing officials
are still uncertaln‘on how they
intend to handle an expected
increase in requests for on-
campus housing this fall.

One option for providing
additional student housing
that had been explored. the
leasing of the St. Agnes
Boarding School in
Loudonville. has fallen
through. according to SUNYA
Space Management
Committee Chair Dennis
Stevens.

Acting Associate Dean for
Student Affairs John Welty
and Acting Director of
Residences Henry Kirchner
confirmed that the St. Agnes
proposal “doesn't look good."

The recent. move of the
Graduate School of Public
Affairs from Mohawk Tower.
freeing 5 floors of office space.
was a. “crash project"
precipitated by the State
Division of Budget‘s
recommendation for an
enrollment increase of
approximately 400 students
this fall Stevens said.

The move willycreate dorm
space for an additional 180
students. Before the DOch
projected increase became
known. housing officials were
predicting that about 800
students would be Without
rooms this fall.

According to Dean for
Student Affairs Neil Brown. it
is likely that the increased
enrollment will have an effect
on the expected housing
shortage predicted for next
semester.‘

Welty said not all of these
additional students will have
to be accomadated by SUNYA
housing. This will depend on
the breakdown of the
additional students. he said:
how many full-time versus
part-time students are added.
how many freshman versus
transfers are accepted. as
well as how many request
housing accomadations.

Any of these additional
students who do request
SUNYA housing will have to
be added on to the already
anticipated figure of 200 who
will request housing in the fall

Cannon report may get through the UAC by the end of the semester.

New Faculty Lines Strengthen Programs

by Mike Pearlman

The reallocation of 23
faculty lines in the SUNYA
budget. and the addition of 12
new ones has helped to
strengthen several academic
departments at SUNYA.
according to Vice President of
Academic Affairs David
Martin.

Martin and Acting SUNYA
President Vincent O'Leary
both said all of the newly
recruited professors are well-
published. itnd that many are
internationally renowned in
their fields.

“I was pleased with the
quality of people we were able
to recruit this year." O'Leary
said. "One ofthe things we are
concerned about is
strengthening programs
under State Education
Department review."

"We‘re beginning to get
acceptances for next fall and I
think it‘s been a very
successful year for
recruitment." said Martin.
"There are people who will

provide additional leadership
and strengths in
departments." he said.

Faculty lines are
reallocated from one
department to another when it
is determined that numerical
inequalities exist.

The process of determining
reallocations is complex. and
involves academic de-
partment heads. administ-

rative committees and the Univ-
ersity Senate.

According to a report put
out by the Education Policy
Commission. the reallocation
and allocation processes will
involve additions to and
depictions from most of the
academic colleges.

Increases in faculty include
seven additions to the college
of Social and Behavioral
Sciences. three additions to
the college of Business
Administration. one addition
to the college of Criminal
Justice. two additions to the
college of Social Welfare. and

Dean Brown said 000'“ a
minimum projection. i expect
the final figure will be
somewhat higher."

More specific predictions on
the number of students for
whom additional housing
must be found. Brown said.
will have to await a
determination of how many
students will be returning to
SUNYA dorms. as well as
further monitoring of
admissions for the fall.

Brown added that the
number of incoming freshmen
is of particular importance.
because 95 percent of
freshmen request on-campus
housing.

Brown said housing.
officials are exploring several |
possible alternatives for
probiding additional housing
for the fall. but that neither he
nor Welty would be more
specific about what these
might be. Brown said the
options chosen will depend on
the number of students that
will have to be accommodated.

Curriculum

by Aron Smith

A goal-oriented distribution
requirement proposal
formulated last month has
been referred to Central
Council‘s Academic Council
and to the deans of all SUNYA
undergraduate schools and
colleges for review.

The Curriculum Committee
of the University Senate‘s
Undergraduate Academic
Council had drafted the
proposal and presented it to
the full body of the UAC Mar.
16.

“Basically. they‘re
soliciting various
constituents of the
University." said Curriculum
Committee member Leonard
Lapinski. “They‘ll solicit
opinions and then the UAC
will act on them. whether they

want to rewrite part of it or

send it back."

one addition to the Graduate
School of Public Affairs.

There will be a decrease of
four faculty members in the
college of Humanities and
Fine Arts. and five faculty
members in the college of
Education. The college of
Library and Information
Science will remain
unchanged.

Martin said professors that
were hired were evaluated for
their teaching abilities.
among other things. "One of
the people coming is
renowned for his
undergraduate teaching." he
said. "We look at their
teaching reputations as well
as the college they come
from." he added.

According to Martin. the 12
new faculty lines in the
budget will not all be used to
hire new professors.

"Four will be used for
faculty lines and the other
eight will be used to create 32
teaching assistantshlps." he
said.

UPS/MANN! IMHO"

Acting Director of Residences Henry Kirchner continued that the St.
Agnes proposal doesn‘t look promising for fall semester housing.

admission and housing
contracts will be received
through May and even into the
months of June and July.
Brown said “we should be In
pretty good shape by the third

week in April. By then we will
have more definite
predictions as to how many
additional students we will
have to house. as well as how
and where we'll house them."

Report To Get Review

UAC Chair George Martin
could not be reached for
comment.

According to Curriculum
Committee Chair Harold
Cannon. Acting SUNYA
President Vincent O'Leary
had placed it deadline on the
proposal's submission to the
UAC.

Extra Time

“I thought we would have to
submit it to O'Leary by April
1.“ hesaid. “Butapparently we
have a little more time."

"The President wasn‘t
holding the Committee to any
timeline." according to Vice
President for Academic
Affairs David Martin. "Harold
Cannon was just concerned
about getting the proposal
passed."

Martin forsees difficulty for
the proposal in the Senate
rather than in tho UAC. He

Since the teaching
itssistaiitships are part time
positions. they are equated to
faculty lines at a. ratio of four
to one.

Martin explained that the
funds from the other sight
lines will be allocated to
academic divisions with
doctoral programs to recruit
additional doctoral students.

The report put out by the
EPC also said that. of the 32
new nssistantships provided
for. the college of Science and
Math and the college of Social
and Behavioral Sciences will
each receive ten. The college
of Humanities and Fine Arts
will receive six. the college of
Education will receive four
and the Graduate School of
Public Affairs will receive
two.

There will also be an overall
increase in assistantships in
all of the colleges except for
the College of Library and
information Sciences. which
will lose one graduate
aseistantship position.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

predicted that “it would at
least get through UAC by the
end of the semester."

“It looks like it's tabled for
the year." countered Central
Council Chair Mike Lissner.
“The Committee decided that
there hadn't been enough
input. that not enough people
knew about the report. and
that more feedback .was
needed on the report.“ ’

Approximately ten
interested students attended
the March 16 meeting.
according to Cannon.

"I don't know what student
representatives may or may
not have been there." he said.
"I can't remember who they
were. I think they represented
something or other. but really
don't know who they were."

According to SA President
Dave Gold. more than twenty
SA representatives attended
the meeting.

"It was really starting to
move really fast without
anybody thinking about it.“
said Gold. "It could change
your education here entirely.
completely. What we wanted
to say is ‘wait a minute.’ "

“It‘s going to go through an
analysis process. where we'll
have a chance to give our
feedback on the issue." said
Lissner. “No one really knew
about this report. They were
just going to push it through
the Senate."

Limiting

“To be perfectly honest. I'm

scared of the proposal." said
Gold. “instead of exposing the
student to a lot of areas. its
going to limit them by blndirig
up so many credits. I think
requiring 48 credits of 300-
level work is absurd."
I “I generally like the idea of
distribution requirements."
said O'Leary. "but exact form
they're going to take will just
have to unfold. It would be
premature to speculate right
now."

UAC has set April 80 as the
deadline for responses to the
curriculum proposal.
