Allinger said.

“"l'bey felt they were doing
us a bigger favorby giving us
a good TAP bill than by
repealing the health fee."
Allinger added. Repeal of the
Health fee would have cost the
State 82.3 million. and the TAP
increases that were passed
gave more than five million to
SUNY students.

There is still a chance that
the health fee will be repealed
before nextsemester. Allinger
said.

Coyne said he feels the fee
may be repealed even before
the supplemental budget is
completed and passed.

"Senator Joseph Pisani
plans to introduce a bill that
would eliminate the health
fee." according to Coyne. it

APRIL 4. 1978

 

by Karen Ins-pity

It was a quiet Saturday in
December. A man sitting in
his chair. in his house in
Kenya. was reading a
newspaper. When a knock at

4. NEW FOCUf

the door- echoed through the
house he wasnt't alarmed. In
all his forty years of living
he'd acquired many friends.
and as a writer he'd become
something of a celebrity. so it
was not. uncommon for
strangers to approach him
and introduce themselves. He
got up. set the paper aside. and
opened the door.

Everything happened so
suddenly he didn't even have
time to protest. The police
intruded and began

 

confiscating his books. His
stunned wife stood by his side

r .

until he was taken away. He
had committed .no crime that
she knew of. He was her
husband. one of act Africa's
most eminent writers. Ngugl
wa Thiong'c — and now he sits
in a prison because he wrote
what he felt.

This event. as reported by
the New York Times of Feb. 19.
adds Kenya to the list of those
governments in tropical
Africa which punish
outspoken writers and artists.
Ngugi‘s peril is very
distressing because he is only
one of the many political
figures in countries all over
the world who are either
imprisoned or forced into
exile because they hold views
contrary to those of their home
government. The prospects
for continued repression are
frightening. and the effects
felt by Kenya‘s writers force
them to be careful.

One of Ngugi'a former
classmates at Makerere.
University in Uganda. Edward
Hower. presently a professor
at Ithaca College and a charter
member of Amnesty
international. spoke at
SUNYA recently seeking
support for the imprisoned
writer. According to flower. a
new book by Ngugi “attacks
Kenyatta. which in Kenya is
like attacking the Pope." Jomo
Kenyatta. a. Kenyan
statesman. is never mentioned
by name in Ngugi's book. but
the book subtly abashes his
leadership.

Amnesty lntemationai is an
organization with central
headquarters in England and
a US. affiliate in New York.
The organization has no
commitment to any ideology
or political sect but works for
the release of "prisoners of
conscience." Amnesty
international defines these as
people who are imprisoned as
a result of “holding or
expressing a religious.
political or other opinion that
does not advocate violence.“
Amnesty sends letters and
appeals to newspapers and

behalf of the political

prisoners who remain in jail.

In mid-February Amnesty
international officially
adopted Ngugl wa 'l'hiong'o'a
case ‘for complete release.

Ngugi was taken from hia‘

home on Dec. 31 and on Jan. 13
Kenyan officials announced
that he was being detained
under Kenya's Preservation of
Public Security Act.

or habeus corpus. Family
visits are rare. there is a
limited amount of literature
available to the prisoners. and
correspondence is prohibited.
The whereabouts of those held
under the act is not. made
public. but Amnesty thinks
Ngugi is probably being held
in the maximum security
prison. Kamati. in Nairobi.
ﬂower is hopeful that the
interests of the United States
in this case will have an
impact on the Kenyan

"sophisticated" to "sloppy."
He also said. and it was
surprising to find out. that
Amnesty International has
interests in the United States.
According to ﬂower. there are
a significant number of
political prisoners in the 0.8..
but "they are handled by other
countries‘chapters. such as W.
Germany's Amnesty. for
example."
Expanded Control

What happened to Ngugi wa
Thiong'o is becoming more
commonplace all over the
globe. Many of the world's
people are slowly being
deprived of their right to
freedom of speech.
Government control and
censorship have expanded
their realm. and the options
dissenting writers have are
minimal; usually either exile
or imprisonment.

predictable and so require less

Another member of the
Biology Department. David
Shub. is “thinking about doing
recombinant research" in a p-
l facility but has yet to submit.
a proposal to the Bio-Hazards
committee. The facility was
ready for use on Feb. 7. but
completion had been delayed

for nearly six months as the
Department awaited delivery
of the “bio—hood". The bio-
hood prevents contamination
of the experiment as well as
containing it so nothing can
leak out.

The addition of this safety
feature grew out of several
public hearings conducted by
the Biology Department. At
