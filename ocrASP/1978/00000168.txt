GRIN AND BEAR IT

Australian scientists are
attempting to prove or disprme the
popular belief that those furry koala
bears are stoned all the time.

Stephan Cook. a researcher at the
University of New South Wales. has
been lccding ii group of captured
koiilas a carefully-regulated diet ot
\arious kinds of eucalyptus leaves to
determine if the animals actually get
drunk on eucalyptus oil.

It is widely believed iii Australia
that the bears. who consume large
quantities of the leaves every day.
live in ti steady state of intoxication
induced by the oil. l'he koalas are
noted for the long hours they sleep
each day and for the fact that they
stagger around rather clumsily when
on the ground.

yellow.

This is the word front the
Minnesota Department of Safety
which says that a German study has
determined which are the safest cur
colors. the ones which can be seen
most easily by other drivers.

The study concluded that the
easiest colors to see are light shades.
such as white and yellow. while
darker tones have low visibility. l'he
researchers found that white.
however. can blend into background
colors. such as snow banks or even
glare. The best color. they say. is a
green-yellow combination. It may be
ugly. biit it's less likely to be hit.

THE RATING GAME

For the past six months or so,
Warner Brothers Pictures has been
hyping the fact that it will soon be
coming out with the ﬁrst hard-core
X-ratcd movie ever produced by a
major Hollywood studio.

The movie, to be titled “Hard
Core." will star GeorgeC. Scott. The
plot.of the ﬁlm reportedly revolves
around Scott. who plays the part ofa
father who discovers that his
daughter has become a porno movie
star.

"Hard Core“ was expected to get
an X-rating because several of the
daughter's sex scenes were allegedly
to be included in the movie itself.

Now. however. the New York
Post is reporting that “Hard Core"
will be toned down in order to get an
R-rating. rather than an X-rnting.

CALM DOWN

A Cambridge University
Professor is warning that miny
parents are turning their babies into
"excitement addicts.“

Professor Ivor Mills reports from
London that many of today‘s
parents don‘t try to end a baby‘s
crying by comforting the infant or
bringing it back to a restful st rte.
Instead. according to Mills. t icy
simply excite the child.

The Professor says that it‘s
common for today‘s parents to i ick
up a crying child. jog it. point iut
flashing lights and do otherthing. to
capture the baby‘s attention to s op
his or her tears.

The result ofall this. Mills say .is
a youngster hooked on the need for
excitement. The Professor cla ms
that as an “excitement addict“ gr ws
older. he or she needs heavier di :sc
of stimulation to avoid depression.
Eventually, Mills says. the children
are apt to become delinquents \ ho
scck whild forms of excitement ust
to become even mildly entertainxl.
