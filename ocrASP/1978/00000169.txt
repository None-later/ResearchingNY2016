By DENNIS SCHEYER

Recently. I have read in every
music journal from Rolling Stone
to Circus that the 70's has been a.
lousy decade for music. While it
ain't the 60’s. the 70's have been
musically affable. The idea here is
not to give you a. rundown of those
fabulous 70‘s to the present. but to
suggest that the recent pessimism
is unfounded.

Looking in my record collection
from A to Z. we find Americahas a
few albums. “Horse With No
Name" had only three notes, but
songs like “1 Need You" and
“Sister Golden Hair" survived the
Top 40 destruction machine.

Boston? Yup. i. like the rest
contributed to their success. It is
now played out. but when it first
came out it‘s high energy rock and
roll was very enjoyable. The new
album is not due for months. They
have lost their credibility. But I'll
bet WCBS-P‘M plays "Long Time"
as an oldie in the '80‘s!

Elvis Costello. When i told a.
friend he was to be included in this
article. he said "Nothing like
dealing with instantdei‘eat." Well.
damn it. i think that as it. person.
l'llvis is an ass. but his music is
great. You just have to digthrough
the name and the personality to
realize it. The new album is great
too.

ii‘rnmpton and Fogelberg are
next to each other. At the risk of
filling the letter to the editor page.
l'm going to compare Frnmpton to
punk rock. Neither is very
innovative. But. the saving grace
is that Frumpton's live thing is

Hollywood (AP) Richard Dreyfuss.
the erstwhile actor in "The
Goodbye Girl.“ and Diane Keaton.
the wilful sweetheart of Woody
Allen in "Annie Hull." were
nnmcd best performers of 1977 at
the 50th Academy Awards
ceremonies Monday night.

"Annie Hall." Woody Allen's
wry comedy of his frustrations in
love. was named best picture of
1977.

The awards for best. director and
best original screenplnyer writer
went to Woody Allen. Allen. who
remained in New York. has said in

i

listenable once a. month. It in too

bad he lost his charisma on “l’m in
You." Fogalberg took a. more
viable John Denver concept.
combined it with a. good voice.
excellent production and turned
out some good product. He‘ll be
around for a. while.

Fleetwood Mac. Not. much too
say. They are really a great sixties
band that made it into the 70's.
“Rumours” is definiter one of the

best rock albums of all time. I hope 1

they prosper for a. long while.
Billy Joel occupies a. section
known as Long Island bands that
achieved respectability. He isthe
only major artist in the se’ction.
Well deserved. but it will be
interesting to see if Good Rats
make it in the next year and a. half.
Back to Joel. “Streetlife Serenade“
had me worried. "The Stranger“
will never be played out. iftaken in
the proper doses. Next time you
see a radio programmer on the
street. explain that “Only the Good

Die Young" should mean killing ,

songs like "Just the Way You Are"
just because they are good for the
D.J. to talk over.

Lynyrd Sknyrd. Let's be blatant
about this one. What. song is called
for. whenever you see u. rock band
in a bar. if it‘s not "Free Bird".
you're not hanging out with a
dangerous enough crowd.

Meatloaf. I say this man will
save the last two years of the
decade and people laugh at me.
Well. i defy yon to find me ten
writers as talented as Jim
Steinman. teamed with anobese
singer who is one of the best

interviews that he finds
competition for artistic nwnrds
distasteful.

“Star Wars." the top money-
grossing film of all tithe. racked
up several eurly awards.
including best score and best
visual effects.

Vanessa Redgrave. the anti-
Nazi martyr of “Julia.” and Jason
Hobnrds. who played mystery
writer Dusheill Hammett in the
same film. won Oscars as best
supporting players of 1977.

"You Light Up My Life,"the title
song from the Joseph Brooks‘ film.

Don’t Knock  Rock.“

Billy Joel, one of the '70's top recording artists.

belters of a song since Janis
Joplin. Until then. play “But Out of
Hell" again.

Just to the right we find Graham
Parker and the 'Rumour along
with the Rubinoos. I'll bet that
three out of five people reading

Annie Hall Wins Best Picture

scored as best original song to no
one‘s surprise. The record by
Debby Boone has been termed by
Billboard Magazine as the best
selling popular record of all time.
Sales so far amount to $4.5 million.

The lilting “A Little Night
Music" was named best
adaptation score for the work of
Jonathon 'l‘unick. The
cinematography honor went to
Vilmos Zsigmond for his
itcheivement with "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."

this piece never listened to an
album by either artist. Well, do it
before the decade runs out and you
miss it.

Steely Dan would take a whole
new article and that's just for
“Countdown to Ectasy." The same
goes for Bruce Springsteen.

Time and space permits little
more. The list is verb incomplete.
But it's just a refresher course for
those of you who are nowthinking
that you are going to have to tell
your kids that the '70's consisted of
“Saturday Night Fever" and Kiss;
euch valuable in their own right
but God forbid them becoming
history. Let's face facts. Most of us
were too young for Dylan. Beatles
and the Stones in their heyday. we
have to make the bestof the decade
we've got. i know it's hard. but lets
try. . .“Someduy girl ldon't know
when we're gonna. get to that place
where we really want to go and
we'll walk in the sun."
