This is just to clear up a few points
which have been preyingon my mind.

First. let us address ourselves to the
issue of required course, which seems
to be foremost in the hearts of the
students of this inestimable
educational institution. lt seems to me
that the basic question involved has
been overlooked by all parties. There
was the letter of the bold Mr. Withheld,
claiming that he shouldn't be required
to take an English course bacause his
command was such that he didn't need
further enlightenment in that field. in
the next issue of the ASP a letter
appeared from a trio of students
indicating that this was perhaps not
the case; maintaining. in fact. that his
use of the language was far from
proficient. and that therefore he
should be required to take an English
course. They went on to complain
about Withheld's taste in the arts.

Finally. we come to the ambiguous
correspondence from David
Amanuensis. exhibiting an almost
studied lack of any grammatic
convention in its defense of. our
present unstructured system. It
almost put one in mind of Nixon's
habit of calling Southern Baptists at
4:00 am. giving Muskie the support of
the Black Panthers. Tragically.
however. David was probably quite
sincere.

All this is quite immaterial. There
are students here who have come
through a semester of English
composition in no better shape than
when they went in: that is to say. still
virtually illiterate. Conversely, I
know people armed with no more than

High School English and a habit of
reading who took the CLEP
examination and received nine
graduation credits in English from the
Registrar. Language skills and
English courses do not necessarily go
together. '

Enough of an introduction. The
point is not whether or not a,person
can benefit from a few
interdisiplinary courses: the point is
whether or not he should be forced to
improve himself against his will.
Assuming all the claims made by the
advocates of distribution
requirements to be true: that a person
can not realize his full potential
whithout a wide spectrum of
educational experience. that the
student is only hurting himself by
restricting himself to a narrow world.
etc; we are still left with the question
as to who has the right to force his
better judgement on the
unenlightened student.

When we were young. around 10 or
thereabouts. it was generally accepted
that we were still typical mammalian
youths. still requiring parental care
and guidance before we were ready to
face the world at large. In another
twenty years. when we are in our early
forties. we will be expected to be able
to deal with society on our own. Some
where in between the transition has to
be made. It is fairly universally
considered that this is the age at which
the aforementioned transition is
realized. At eighteen and nineteen. we
can vote. be drafted. and be tried for
capital crimes. in fact. if we don‘t learn
to think for ourselves now. there is
evidence we may have a great deal of

that we must he allowed to make our
own mistakes at this point. The
question is not if it is wrong for a
student to restrict himself. but if it is
wrong to make the right decision for
him. When-a person starts out in life.
he is always going to make a few
mistakes. Better he should make them
here titan later when the effects could
be much more disastrous.

Furthermore. above and beyond the
psychological and sociological
aspects. we have the sample concept
of freedom. the basic precept upon
which our society is theoretically
founded. The right to be wrong. It's as
simple as that. No one has the God
given right to tell someone else at this
university what to do.

One might counter that by saying
that the student made his choice by
entering the university. and the school
then has a right to require what it
wants for a liberal arts education.
Well. let us keep in mind that the
school is a really here for the student
and to serve the student. Don't-forget
the 120 credits required for a degree: if

trouble teaming to dose at a latch
stage of our lives. Specifically. I feel ‘

  

the student  it”;  
liberalise his education. he, “not
going at graduate wholly ignorant.

What he missies in theater and the ‘

humanities he might compensate for
in his field of. concentration. In the
final evaluation. 1 think we must
admit that it is the student who knows
his own special case been-and it is he.
and no one else. who should determine
where he is lacking. and where his

attentions could be most profitably r

focused. It is a case of simple human
rights. ,

Let me add a final not of clarification
on this topic. I think a liberal
education is vitally important for
everybody. I am a combined physics-
math major. but also into history,
theater. and several gym courses. etc.
I think that sort of thing is really
important: but that's Just what I think.
That‘ doesn‘t mean that everybody
should be forced to do what a few
people. or even a majority of the
people. think is right.

Like the man said: "I may disagree
with what you say. butl will defend to
the death your right to say it."
