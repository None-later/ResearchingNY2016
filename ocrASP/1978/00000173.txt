PHOIm Aﬂl. (AP) Joe
Altobelli has spent nearly
three decades listening to
critics say baseball is a dying

_ sport. and he's teamed to scoff.

"People have been saying
for almost. as long as I can
remember that baseball is
dying," said Altobelli. the San
Francisco Giants manager
who (began playing
professionally in 1951. “Heck.
look around. People are more
interested in baseball than
they've ever been."

Altobelli. beginning his
second year as San Francisco
manager. had just received
some bad news on this
particular day. Vida Blue. who
came to the Giants in a recent
trade. wasn't going to show up
for the Giant‘s exhibition
game.

“Sure. I‘m disappointed.“ he
said. “But one thing I‘ve
learned is that baseball will go
on. It will go on withouthim. it
will go on without me.“

Altobelli said people
obviously like baseball the
way itis, thus aren‘t interested
in efforts to streamline the
game.

"People are always talking
about speeding the game up."
he said. "but I'm not sure
anybody really wants it
speeded up. People go to

 Optimistic

games for socializing. for
having a good time. and they

don't particularly want to.

drive to therpsrk for a game
that's just going to last an
hour and a half."

The Giants manager said he
typecasts people who say
baseball's too slow.

“Show me the guy who says
it's too slow and I'll show you
a poker player."he said. ‘They
want new action all the time.
Show me the guy who likes
baseball the way it is.
appreciates the strategy and
the less obvious parts of the
game. and I'll show you a
chess player."

One reason for increased
interest in baseball. Altobelli
said. is that more people
understand the intricacies of
the game.

“Fans are much more
knowledgeable about baseball
now." he said. "They
understand why you decide to
walk one player and pitch to
another. Broadcasters and
writers do a good job of

explainingnotjust how
particular plays happened.
but also why they happened."

Altobelli said that. going

back to his many years in
baseball. the most important
advice he can give players —

take life one day at a tints.
"I used to be in such ahurry

for tomorrow to come." 'he
said. ‘l'd sit at home dying for
spring training to start. then
when it did. I couldn't wait for
the season to begin. Then on
the last day of the season. it
would start all ‘over again.

“Not anymore. I enjoy the
moment. whatever l'm doing.
If you keep worrying about
tomorrow. it seems like you're
always hurrying and not
getting anywhere."

Altobelli. 45. leaned back
deep in thought. then said.
“You know. I wasn't able to
afford a college education. but
I feel like baseball has given
me a this education. I‘m
grateful for that."
