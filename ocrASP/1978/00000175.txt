Last fall. the Albany State
varsity tennis team finished
with a 3-2 record and a
surprising second-place
finish in the SUNYAC
championships.

The latter came despite the
fact that three of the squad's
top players were sidelined
much of the season with
injuries.

For the spring season. all
three players: Phil Ackerman.
Gary Block and Ted Kutzln
will be back and ready to play.
In addition. Larry Linott. who
was Union College's numer-
one player last year. will be
joining the team after
transferring to Albany.

Dane's head coach [lob
Lewis is therefore optimistic
about his team's chances this
spring. “if everyone remains
healthy. we'll be as strong as
any team I've ever had." said
Lewis.

Ackerman. who has acareer
singles record of 30-9 at

Albany. suffered the entire fall
seeeon from an ankle injury.

Many people say the “home-
field" advantage doesn‘t work
when there aren't any
spectators to root for the home
team. But in the Albany State
lacrosse team‘s 10-6 loss to
Oswego Saturday. "Oswego
clearly had the home-field
advantage. but for a different
reason.

The field at Oswego is
recovering from the deadly
winter. With the recent rains
and warmer weather. the once
snow field. has become a mud
field rather than a grass field.

In fact. in some spots the mud .

was six inches deep.

"The field did hurt us a
little." said Albany's head’
coach Mike Motta. The Danes
had been practicing on a
normal field the past few
weeks in preparation for
Saturday‘s season opener.

However. looking at the
scoreboard through the first
three periods. you wouldn't
have known that.

After practicing with the team

would "definitely be 100 per

Friday at Amherst.
Ackerman. Block and
Kutzin are rejoining a team
that is “very strong at the

number one and two
positions." according to
Lewis.

Paul Foldinan. who had been
Albany's number-one player
for the past three years. will
have competition this year
from Linett. “Paul will face the
stiffest challenge for the
number-one position since
he's been at this campus." said
Lewis.

Lewis feels that this
competition can only be

Albany got on the

first of two goals the all-time
Danes' goal scorer would have
on the day.

Oswego managed to tie the
game. but Albany‘s freshman
attacker. John Nelson. gave
Albany 8. 2-1 lead by the close
of the first session.

Quick Goal

In the third period, Albany
came out and Nelson scoredva
quick goal to give Albany a6-4
advantage. But that was the
last time the Danes would get
the ball into the Oswego net.

Oswego. with a pestering
attack. tied the score at 6-6.
“Going into the fourth period
it (the game) was still a toss-
up." said Motta.

The "toss-up" belonged to
Oswego and they never let go.

Motta credited the Danes'
loss to what he called.
“unsettled situations." "We

weren't clearing the ball from

While the defense did have

the offense didn’t. "They did a

“Both players realize that it

Acting SUNYA President
Vincent O'Leary agreed. “A

According to O‘Leary.
SUNYA can't commit funding
to enhance the department

Tax Increase Proposed

by Aron Smith

A projected budget deficit of
$9000 has resulted in an SA
proposal to raise the
mandatory student tax from
the current $66 per year to $70.
If students approve
the referendum next
week, SUNY Buffalo
will be the only
school Within the
SUNY system with a student
tax remaining below the
maximum.

Expansion of groups and
services, intercollegiate
athletics. and double-digit
inflation are cited by BA as
reasons for the proposed tax
increase.

According to SA Budget
Committee Chair John
Sharkey. n will be difficult to
maintain student services at
their present level even if the
referendum is approved.

Takes U. Maryland Post

SUNY Stony Brook President John Toll announced
yesterday that he has accepted the presidency of the
University of Maryland. Toll. who was selected two weeks
ago by Maryland's Board of Regents following a five-
month search. said he will leave Stony Brook July 1.

’l‘oll‘s resignation comes despite repeated appeals for
him to stay in the SUNY system from various public
officials. Governor Hugh Carey. as well as several of Long
island's State legislators. reportedly asked To“ to stay.

The Maryland regents and acting Governor Blair Lee
reportedly agreed to lure Toll to their state. Toll‘s new
salary was announced as $62000. almost $15.000 more than
his earning at Stony Brook.

Current University of Maryland President Wilson
Elkins earns 354.000 per year.

Toll told reporters yesterday afternoon that. despite his
departure. Stony Brook and the State University in
general had "a tremendously bright future." He noted that

skidded into the east bound
lane of Route 7 and collided
with a yellow pick—up truck
which was stopped for the red

A police sketch showed that
the entire passenger side of
LaGory’s car was severely
damaged.

The driver of the westbound
truck. Danny Parker. 22. was
uninjured. according to the
report. He was arrested for
running the stoplight and
speeding.

According to witness John

if students do support the

Assembly will make a
recommendation. possibly for
an “open-ended" or unlimited

LaGory's classes will resume

Ward‘s course on the
sociology of aging will be
taught by Arthur Richardson.
His research methods class
will be led by Farrell and a

LaGory‘s urban ecology
course will be taken over by
Paul Meadows and a graduate

All students who had Ward

be assigned to Mark Levy.
although they may choose

they wish. said Farrell.
