of an amount." said Assistant

SUNY Vice Chancellor for:

Student Affairs Ron Bristow.
“But the amount could be a
thousand dollars.“ he said.
“And that would be the same
thing."

The current ceiling on the
student tax was imposed by
the SUNY Chancellor's office
in 1971.

According to Bristow. “it
was generally agreed at the
time the amount was set that it

. was an appropriate amount."

But for most SUNY schools.
the seventy dollar maximum
is no longer an “appropriate
amount." The Student
Government Association at
SUC New Paltz may soon be
bankrupt. According to SGA
President Duane Holloway.
consistently decreasing
enrollments at New Paltz has
translated into financial
suicide for SGA.

“Every semester there is a
decrease in students." said
Holloway. “If the people aren't
here. we don't collect activity
fees from them."

During recent budget
cutbacks. the college‘s
gymnasium was closed for all
activities but physical
education classes.

Holloway sees a vicious
cycle in that students leave
due to inefficient services.
which in turn result from
budget cutbacks.

“The dorms are filthy
because the legislature and
the Board of Trustees have
forced us to fire janitors." said
Holloway. “If it's dirty. people
leave. If people leave, we get
less activity fees.
Everything's connected.“

“We just can't fund 63
organizations. plus overall
operations." he said. "We‘ve
pinched pennies and dimes
jush to keep things at the
levels of last year and the year
before.“

The present situation at
SUNYA is somewhatdifferent
from New Paltz. as an annual
influx of freshmen
consistently causes housing
problems. However, Gold
threatens ramifications for
student activities reminiscent
of New Paltz. if students opt
not to impose a tax increase
upon themselves next week.

"There's just going to have
to be severe, severe cutbacks if
this referendum isn't passed."
said Gold. "Students should
realize they're paying the
equivalent of just a pitcher of
beer a semester." he said.
"Their parents usually pay for
it anyway."

Budget to Include Abortion Money

ALBANY. NY. (AP) With a new $i1.957 billion budget finally in
place six days late, New York state began yesterday to
straighten out the disarray in its finances caused by a bitter
battle over state funding of abortions. The battle ended in defeat
for anti-abortion forces early yesterday morning when the
Legislature approved the $7 billion portion of the state budget
which provides state aid to localities. Included in the budget
was some $15 million for Medicaid abortions. The action
immediately opened the door to resumption of welfare
payments by the state to localities. And it allowed the state to
proceed with the initial steps in its annual "spring bori‘ownig.‘
which raises a total of $4 billion to allow the state to advance ind
to school districts and localities.

Centers Violate Regents Guidelines

by Denise Lenci

The New York State Board
of Regents received a. study at
its March meeting indicating
that off-campus extension
centers affiliated with many
colleges and univeristies in
the state may be violating
state regulations.

Potter Club Recharter Granted

by Karen D. Murphy

The Edward E. Potter Club
has been rechartered through
February 1979 as a result of a
report by a special committee
assigned to evaluate the club.

In response to that report,
Dean for Student Affairs Neil
Brown will specify a set of
goals and expectations for the
club to determine whether or
notitwillbe rechartered again
in the future.

Brown has not said what the
scope of the expectations will
be. although he hopes they
"will help the fraternity group
to grow stronger.“ He also
stressed that “if they don't
meet the expectations. I will
put them out of business."

A permanent committee. the
l’otter Club Evaluation and
Assistance Committee. will be
set up to review the club's
activities. According to
Brown. the committee will
help the club with its overall
structure and activities.

"The committee will assist
the Potter Club in reviewing
its constitution. aims. goals
and purposes." Brown said.

Examination of the Potter
Club began last April after a
list of complaints was filed
against the club by Colonial
Quad Coordinator Howard
Woodruff. The list cited 15

incidents of misconduct by
Club members during the 1976-
77 school year.

Among the charges listed
were false fire alarms. club
members smoking marijuana
in Hamilton Hall where the
club is located, and threats
made by members against
Woodruff.

At that time. a temporary
committee was formed to
determine whether Potter
Club was meeting its

constitutional objectives,
whether it deserved
specialized housing in the
University‘s residence halls.
and whether the group should
continue to be chartered on
campus.

That committee‘s report
went to Brown who granted
the club a limited charter, set
up the permanent review
committee. and authorized

ALBANY STUDINT PRESS

Eighteen institutions which
have extension centers in
Westchester County were
studied in a report sponsored
by the State Education
Department. Among the
institutions surveyed were
SUC New Paltz and SUC
Purchase.

Off-campus extension
centers operate like
temporary branches of a
university. offering extension
courses and degrees under the
asupices of a larger
institution.

The report claims that
faculty who teach in off-
campus programs often do not
possess the qualifications
required by the Commissioner
of Education. It also says that
some extension centers "do
not meet standards for class
attendance as defined in
Commissioner's Regulations.
nor do they appear to require
extra independent study to
compensate for reduced class
time."

In addition. the report says
that Master's degree
programs offered at the
centers often do not require a
comprehensive test. thesis. or
special project. as is required
by the state.

According to SED Director
of Academic Programs
Donald Nolan. the study was
undertaken at the request of
the Board of Regents. 'l‘he
report‘s introduction cites
“the sharp increase of off-
ciimpus centers across the
State" as justification for the
study centers.

SED Director of
Information Donald Bloom
said the Board of Regents has
expressed concern at the
report. and requested that a
study of the charges be made
including recommendations

for action.

The report expresses
concern that extension
centers are coming to
resemble branch campuses.
which they are not. “By
Regulation. an extension
center is "a site other than the
principal center of an
institution or any of its branch
campuses at which individual
extension courses are offered
on a limited and temporary
basis for the convenience of
students." the report states.

Several of the institutions
studied offer entire degree
programs or significant
portions of degree programs
off-campus. according to the
study.

The report also states that
nine of the institutes studied
have been offering courses
off-campus for four years or
longer. The report says this
cannot be considered
temporary.

The study claims that off-
campus operations have
grown in recent years due to
the effort to meet the demands
of adult students and to enable
colleges to amintain
enrollments in the face of a
declining birthrate

“In general. the
administrative offices of off-
campus centers are
understaffed." the report said.
It also states that
undergraduate admission
requirements at off-campus
centers may be less
demanding than those at the
parent institution.

According to the report.
faculty at the centers involved
in the study generally lack
teaching experience.
academic credentials. and
research and publication
records. in comparison to
faculty at the main campuses.
