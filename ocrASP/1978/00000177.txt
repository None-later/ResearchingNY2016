Evaluated my  we  

by Charles Eisner .

The Assessment of Courses
and Teachers booklet. which
last came out in Spring. um.
may be reissued if a new
system for distributing the
evaluation forms is approved
by the Deans of the various
SUNYA schools.

ACT, a student evaluation
booklet which rates both
courses and instructors. was
distributed for two years prior

to the Spring ’70 semester.
according to Paul Feldmsn, a
student who helped to
organise the new ACT
distribution system.

“ACT fell apart because the
prevailing attitude on campus
was that students had to do all
the work." Feldinsn said.
Under the old system.
hundreds of students were
needed to go to each class and
handle the distribution of the

Broken Podium Ropes ,
Endanger Blind Students

by Edith Berelson

One of the temporary safety
ropes at the edge of the
podium. put up prior to spring
break by the SUNYA
Rehabilitation Center will be
replaced by the Plant
Department following a near
accident recently. The center
will also be adding new ropes
around the podium.

The ropes were put up by the
Rehabilitation Center as a
safety measure after a. faculty
member told the center of an
incident in which a. blind
student nearly fell off the edge
of the podium.

Safety chains. which were
included in the original plans
for the campus. are strung
from pillar to pillar around
the podium between
buildings. However. there are
gaps in places where chains
have been removed.

"There are spots where you

can just walk right off without
hitting any obstruction."
Coordinator of Library
Services to the Handicapped
Frank Pozo said.

SUNYA Rehabilitation
Services Counselor Sabina
Vermulen said that one of the
ropes put up between the
Business. Administration and
Social Science buildings was
out.

The ropes are an important
safety measure which helps to
increase the mobility of
persons with a visual
disability. Vermulen said.

According to SUNYA
Facilities Program
Coordinator Joel True. the
Plant Department will be
putting up ropes where gaps
exist sometime this week.
These ropes will be replaced
by permanent chains this
summer.

   
  
    

evaluition forms.

Fsldmsn 'termed the old
distribution system “very
inefficient." but said he hopes
the new system will be
different. '

"Under the new system. our
ACT toms will be distributed
along with the regular
university evaluation forms
that each department
distributes." he said

Feldman added that. in
doing so. fewer students will
be needed to distribute and
collect the forms. and more
students will be available to
analyze the information.

Although this plan has yet
to be given full approval.
Feldman said the new system
will probably be approved by
all departments.

“[SA President] Dave Gold.
[SA Vice President] Kathy
Baron. and myself have met
with the Deans of the various
schools." be said. "and we've
received mostly positive
responses."

The goal of those attempting
to revise the ACT system is to
prepare an ACT booklet
evaluating the Spring '78
courses. Feldman said this
will be dependent on the
approval of the new
distributing system and the
interest shown by students at
upcoming interest meetings.

The administration has
given the Chemistry

assurances that SUNYA will
provide the department with
increased funding. O'Leary

Similar outside

the termination of the English

models to try and build up

Implementing all the
suggestions an independent
review team may make does
not necessarily mean the
department will be successful
in its attempts to restorethe
program. Satumo said.

"We're asking them to come
here and tell the program that
we'd have to do to establish a
PhD program." he said.
“We're assuming that the
suspension is valid. and what
we expect from these reviews
is an analysis which can be
implemented."

The Potters can not return to

because of a residence plan to
expand the number of co-ed

Hall. currently all male. is
being made into a co-ed dorm.
That decision. and the club's
