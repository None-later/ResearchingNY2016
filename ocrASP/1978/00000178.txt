Presidential 

by Matthew NJCox

As the SUNYA Presidential
Search Committee enters the
final stage of its work. the
question of whether to hold
open hearings with

candidates is not
resolved.

NOWI Search Committee
1'00“! Chair J. Vanderbilt
‘ Straub said
upcoming interviews with the
five or six most likely
candidates will be kept

confidential.

Search Committee
Executive Secretary Sorrell
Chesin agreed. but said a
second round of meetings.
with a further refined group of
about three candidates. may
be held for the SUNYA
community at large.

Straub would not commit
himself. "Frankly. 1 can't tell
you if we'll be holding [open
meetings] this time because
none of that has been worked
out yet."

Meetings between final
candidates and SUNYA
groups not associated with the
presidential search have been
held in the past.

At a meeting one week ago.
the committee narrowed its
search to five or six

candidates. Members of the
committee went into that
meeting still considering
about seven names.

The committee is
attempting to come up with
one. two. or three names to
pass on to the SUNYA
University Council._ It has
been meeting since lllt
August. looking for a

permanent successor to’

former SUNYA President
Emmett Fields. new President
of Vanderbilt University in
Nashville. Tennessee.

The confidentiality of the
candidates“ names will be
maintained during the initial
visits to campus because
some of the candidates may
still not want it known that
they're being considered.
Straub said.

“We're trying to keep this as
calm and as quiet as possible.“
Straub :said.. “We‘re coming
up to the stage where we have
to be very careful as to what
we do."

Chesin said that. even if the
candidates are eventually
invited to SUNYA for open
meetings. an effort will be
made to limit publicity.

“We're going to try and keep
things discreet." Chesin said.

LIVE ALBUM ROCK

Candidates in a presidential
search often fear that the
release of their names may
jeopardize their present
position. or hurt their
professional image. should it
become known that they were
nominated and didn't get the
job. A president of a given
college may not want his
employers to know that he is
eyeing a similar post
somewhere else, for example.

Acting SUNYA President
Vincent O‘Leary. who is‘listed
in the fall ‘78 schedule of
classes as an instructor in five
courses. has refused to
comment on whether he has
been contacted by the
committee. His name was put
into nomination by a number
of SUNYA faculty.

O‘Leary is still a tenured
professor in the School of
Criminal Justice. of which he
was chair before assuming the
presidency. He indicated
yesterday he was unaware he
had been scheduled to teach in
the fall.

SUNYA‘s last presidential
search. conducted just three
years ago. featured meetings
of final candidates with
SUNYA students and faculty
not directly involved with the

search process. Whilegstill
just. a candidate. millet
Fields. then Executivevijcq'

President and. Dean [of]
Facultiesat the University of .

Houston. appeared before
representatives of campus
groups on March 17. 1975.

During that meeting. TV
crews which filmed the
candidate gave rise to ccncem
that such publicity might
cause Fields and two other
candidates who were to visit
later to withdraw from the
search. Fields. who was
reportedly angered at the
publicity then. was away from
Vanderbilt and could not be
reached for comment
yesterday.

“Although we had made the
names public on campus. we
asked people if they would not
make it public elsewhere."
Chesin said. While the
candidates were aware of the
risk their visits might pose to
the confidentiality of their

MduVot-fte

anominations. the exposure. ,
could have jeopardised their. .
candidacies. he said. i '
. The committee will turn the. i.
results of lanai-eh osm- .
University Council. which}
must make a “single
recommendation to the BUNY
Board of Trustees. The
Trustees will make the actual
appointment of the next
SUNYA President. Strauh
said.

Straub also chairs the
University Council. He
described the Search
Committee as “an arm of the
University Council." The
committee is composed of four
faculty members. four
students. three members of the
University Council. an alumni
representative. and one non-
teaching professional.
Chesin. a secretary and
a representative of
SUNY Central sits in on
the meetings but can't
vote in proceedings.
