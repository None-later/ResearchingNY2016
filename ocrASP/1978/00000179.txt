TRAGEDY STRIKES

Tragedy has marred the first
annual World Championship
Coakroach Race in Galveston.
Texas.

After a speedy little roach
named “Foolish Pleasure"
was proclaimed the winner.
the owners of the insects were
celebrating at O'Malley’s Bar.
and Grill.

Another renowned fast-
footed roach named “P.W."
escaped. As harried owners
and trainers tried to catch
P.W. in a jar. they
accidentally injured its legs.
Roach experts report that
P.W. will never race again.

FUTURE CALLS

The Telephone Company
may not believe in astrology.
but that sure hasn't stopped
Ma Bell from making a few
bucks off horoscopes.

New York Telephone has
been running newspaper ads
in the Mid—West. urging
residents there to dial long-
distance to New York for their
daily horoscope readings.

The ads have reportedly
prompted about 4000 long-
distance calls each day just
from customers living in
Southeastern Michigan. The
Dial-A-Horoscope service
was started in Manhattan
several years back. and
features 12 different phone
numbers, one for each sign of
the Zodiac. 'l‘he readings are
changed daily.

The Phone company reports
that around 100.000 calls a day
are pouring into the service.
With many of the callers
paying expcnswe long,"
distance rates.

TOGETHER AT LAST

Followers o'f Action Comics‘
mild-mannered reporter

Clark Kent. and his co-workcr
Lois Lane. can now breathe a
sigh of relief.

Clark. otherwise known to
comic book fans as
“Superman”. and Lois Lane
have finally gotten married.

Action says that Clark
finally realized how much he
loved Lois. and this month's
April edition shows the two of
them tying the knot after 40
years of courtship.

An Action spokesperson
says . however. that there are
no plans for the pitter-patter
of little “superfeet” around the
wedded couple's household. . .
at least not for a while.

NAME GAME

What‘s the difference
between German beer made in
America and just plain old
American beer?

If the beer's made by the
Miller Brewing Company. it
may just be the price.
according to a recent report in
Cosumers Reports.

Consumer Reports says that
it conducted a test with 24
staffers to see if they could tell
the difference in taste between
Lowenbrau. the German brew
made by Miller in the United
States. and Miller High Life.
which is also marketed in the
US,

Miller Beer with the German
name sells for $2.50 asix-pack
while Miller Beer with the

for o n

Miller brand name sells for
$1.80 per pack.

The magazine says that
staffers were given three
glasses of beer to taste. two of

which were from the same .

bottle. and then were asked to
identify which glass
contained the beer that was
different. Only 11 of the total
24 judgements were correct.

The magazine reports that
its experiments indicate that
domesticallymade beers with
foreign names may be
overpriced.

STAYING SINGLE

Divorce is becoming the key
to success in the world of big
business.

Eugene Jennings. a
professor of Management at
Michigan State University
reports that corporations are
finding that single executives
are capable of greater
dedication to their jobs than
their married counterparts.

Jennings says that
corporate leaders. who just a
few years ago were dead set
against divorced executives.
are now finding advantages in
promoting older. divorced
employees.

The Professor says that
corporate life is really a single
person's world. where the
devoted executive can spend
long hours at work without
having to worry abouta home
life. According to Jennings.
about 20 percent of those at the
top of the U .S.corporatc
ladder have been divorced.

WATCH CLOSELY

The old complaint used to be
that “Johnny can't read."

Today. however. the newest
concern being voiced is that
children can‘t watch telivision
intelligently.

To correct this. the National
PTA has announced plans for
the special development of a
school curriculum.
instructing students. in
Kindergarten through High
School. on how to watch TV
properly.

Grace Baisinger. the
President of the National PTA.
says the organization has
launced a multi-million dollar
three-year crash program to
develop four differnt
curriculums at various grade
levels to teach kids how to
watch the boob tube.

The curricula will include
discussions of TV scripts.
videotapes of actual programs
and guidelines for spotting
what are considered "good"

and “bad” elements on
telivision.
BIG TIME

Actor John Travolta has
formed his own production
company.

The 24-year-old Travolta.
who became an overnight
sensation and won an
Academy Award nomination
for his starring role in
"Saturday Night Fever". will
now be able to select and
produce his own movies.

Before he can do his own
thing. however. Travolta must

as a love story between
Travolta. In the role of a
delivery boy. and a “Cored
Malibu Housewife." played by
Lily Tomlin.

THE REAL THING
The giant 3M Corporation is
reportedly making a healthy

profit turning out gallons of 

blood.

It isn't exactly blood
however. although it‘s
awfully close to it. What 3M
makes is a product that looks.
feels. and runs like blood so
that gore can be simulated on
the stage and movies.

The red stuff you see in most
of those bloody scenes is
really a substance called
“nextel”. A gallon of the stuff
sells for $45.

Nextel is purchased in large
quantities not only by
Hollywood studies. but by
police departments and first
aid training firms who use it to
accustom their trainees to the
real stuff.

And other major consumers
are some of the more dramatic
rock music acts. particularly
the group Kiss. 3M reports
that. for better or worse. its
phones have been ringing off
the hook recently. with
requests from young callers to
“send me some of that stuff
that Kiss uses."
