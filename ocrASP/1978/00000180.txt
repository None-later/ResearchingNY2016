Incomplete Night Fever

by Jon Lafayette .‘

V You awake from the stupor around
April. Another semester is about to
end. But look. there in the ASP is that
dreaded announcement: April 14 is the
last day to make up incompletes.

You stare at the page. You break

’ out in a sweat. Incomplete fever
strikes again!

According to the 1977-78
Undergraduate Bulletin. the big "I" is
“a temporary grade assigned by the
instructor only when the student has
nearly completed his course
requirements but because of
circumstances beyond the student's
control the work is not completed.

But to anyone who dabbles in the
many time consuming extra-
curricular activities here at SUNYA.
the incomplete becomes a sort of
religion. and it’s completion one of the
seven great labors.

To these people. going to. and
studying for tests and writing papers
on time seems mundane and trivial
compared to the wonde rs they work in
their non-academic endeavors. So. as
the end of the semester draws near,
these busy folk must plead with their
professors so that they don't fail their
courses this semester.

This does not. of course. lessen the
possibility that they will not fail that
course next semester.

After a particularly busy semester.
some of these poor wretches may wind
up with a large number of
incompletes; or more likely a
transcript with a liberal sprinkling of
both incompletes and the dread
withdrawal. In fact. you can often spot
your student leaders by the "I"s and
“W“s on their transcripts.

So around April. the Campus Center
offices are buzzing with the plaintive
whimpers of the mighty who must get
to work and write papers for courses
they don't remember and probably
never attended.

If you listen very carefully as you
walk past the fountain. you can hear

them. ever so faintly: “I‘ve got to write
three papers for my incompletes by
Friday?" Panic and hysteria are
common during the middle weeks in
April. and the lights of the Campus
Center burn brightly through the
night as these lost souls pull all-
nighters to get those papers typed on a
Selectrio.

This desperation is genuine. after
all: the only way to getoutof finishing
an incomplete on time is to get an
extension on an incomplete. Some
incompletes have been extended over
more than three years, and were
completed only when the professor.
kind souls that they all are. passed the
miscreant out of pity.

One can make a career out of
incompletes. ltcan become a Veeckian
situation around registration time.
what with one semester coming. one
semester going. and one semester
incomplete.

Some people have even taken
semesters off just to finish off their
incompletes. usually because those
are all the credits they need to
graduate.

The situation has improved, though.
In the dark ages. (prior to August 20.
1973. a true red letter day) there was a
“Z” grade. According to the Bulletin
this 'dastardly letter was an
"administrative penalty grade"
assigned for “failure to complete an
"I" or when no other grade was
appropriate."

Just try to imagine a transcript with
“I"s. “W”s. and "Z"s on it. You
couldn‘t tell the grades without a
scorecard.

You may be able to explain grades
as low as a "C" to your parents. but
they get mighty surly when you
grades approach the other end of the
alphabet.

There are worse things than
incomplete fever; because if you don‘t
finish them you get the “academic
probation blues."

CONGRATD LATIONS!

You‘ve PASSED

INSPECTION !!

radk:
racism

To the Editor:

A column published in the March 31
, issue of the ASP was most interesting
to me and several of my staff
members. The thesis. argued by Ron
Simmons and Howard Straker. is that
racism is entrenched in American
institutions. notably SUNYA's mass
mediaorganizations. After eloquently
outlining the problem as they see it.
the gentlemen seek to prove their case
by describing racist activities of those
groups.

The charge is made that WCDB
“arbitrarily decided to cater to the
majority of their potential listening
audience." I fully agree that that
decision was made. but there was
certainly nothing arbitrary about it.

The musical format of the radio
station, which apparently is the only
portion of our programming which
the writers choose to address. comes
as a result of very careful study of the
needs and desires of our listening
audience. We have conducted these
deliberations based on the assumption
that members of all religions. sexes.
and races will be among our audience.
The format. one which we are all very
proud of. is known as a “fusion”
format. one which combines various
forms of music. including rock. jazz.
country. folk. and rhythm 8; blues.

In addition to this general format.
WCDB airs five programs per week of
all jazz music. in an attemptto fill that
particular void in the entertainment
offered by area broadcasters. Several
special music shows are also included
in our weekly schedule. including a
program designed to familiarize
listeners with the music of the
Carribbean: reggae. calypso. and
other styles.

The point. I believe. is clear. Mr.
Straker and Mr. Simmons point out
that WCDB‘s audience could benefit
from exposure to various styles and
forms of entertainment. We
wholeheartedly agree.

'l‘o cry “racist” in it situation that
does not warrant it is very detrimental
to the cause of those who have

 

legitimate complaints of bigotry. Yes.

gentlemen. you are crying well. What
happens five years from now when a
campus group seeks to keep minority
members of their staff? Do you really
think anyone is going to be listening
by then?

The authors of the column in
question are both quite familiar with

media on this campus. I cannot, forthe .‘
life of me. understand the VOCalizing "
of complaints of this sort when there '

are so many real problems facing all
students at this university.

response

To the Editor:

I found the March 3l.Gucst()p1nmn
written by Ron Simmons and Howard
Straker to be particularly
objectionable and lllCUnSISlenl. I
cannot accept the article‘scontentions
that academic freedom broods
oppression and racism: thnt some
Americans are not Alllcl'lt'llns. but
members of the Third World; and that
student groups should treat the
university community as n (.‘llllUt‘llUll
of mutually antagonistic lllllllll‘lly
groups.

As the current Editor-in Chiefol‘the
'l‘orch. I am compelled to respond to
the charges that the yearbook
perpetuates racism. 'l‘hc 'l'orch has
consistently welcomed new members.
We have organized general interest
meetings and advertised them lll the
ASP. The selection of stall editors is
based upon experience. tulcul,
continued interest. and lllUthllllllll.
The stuff is open to anyone mien-stud
enough to donate the timo.

Yearbook photographs are suit-vied
on the basis of technical quality and
thematic relevance. it is our goal to
portray the experience 4:1 the
university student body as it whole,
We do not intend to t'utt-gonzu
students in an effort to cover
minorities individually: lll Slllllt‘ u 21y.
each of us is a minority. We do.
however. cover special events and
organizations that either come to our
attention or are brought to our
attention by interested students 11
