By CHARLES PERM
am so incredibly happy
‘ ‘ right now — I’m happier
than I’ve ever been in my
life. I'm doing what I
enjoy so thoroughly...it's
a rich life."

That is how 67-year-old Jean
Muir. a visiting faculty member in
SUNYA's Theater Department.
describes her present job
compared to an early life as an
actress on Broadway and in
Hollywood during the 1930’s and
into the ‘40's. Her films include
such notables as A Midsummer
Night’s Dream with James
Cagney. Stars OverBr03dway and
Oil for the Lamps of China with
Pat O'Brien.

Yet in 1950 her acting career
ended abruptly when she fell
victim to the blacklisting of the
entertainment industry. Ten years
later she began to teach acting on
the college level and has been
doing it ever since.

Muir‘s new career as a visiting
professor was necessitated by
what she feels to have been a
premature termination of her
permanent position as Master
Teacher of Actinv at Stephens
College in Columbia. Missouri.

Stephens. a women‘s college.
has almandatory retirement tin-loll
when Muir turned 65 in 1976 it was
envoked. She had been there since
1968.

Muir said of the rule. “[it]
declares that on a certain day in a
person's life. they at that moment
become obsolete and senile. so
they retire them. I would have
nothing to do with that...lt's damn
tomfoolery to retire people at 65."

To prove her point. she earned a
Bachelor's degree from Stephens
in 1977 “just to show them". A
picture of the commencement
exercise is one of her office walls
next to her current schedule of
classes.

That incident seems typical of
the way Muir has conducted her
life. While speaking to her. one
senses a toughness and drive
undiminished by age. This
toughness is mixed with a certain
sensitivity and genuine concern
for the world she lives in. and more
lmportantly:.the people in it.
Muir does not enjoy discussing
the blacklisting. not because it is
too painful to recall. but because it
bores her just as most past events
d:. In a concise. business-like way
a e recounts "a
thing.” very simple
In 1950 she was cast in her first
mother role. that of Henry
Aldrich's mother in a new ’I‘.V
series based on the old radio
series.

Three hours before air-time the
cast was informed that there
would be no show. There had been
to telephone calls and 2 telegrams

 

 

 

sent in protest of her appearance
as Henry's mother on the
program.

Starting o Career
At 67 Years Young

civil rights movements. That was
enough to elicit the twelve
complaints against her
appearance. "How my appearance
as Mother Aldrich was supposed
to ‘undermine or try to overthrow
the government through the use of
force of violence' I'm not quite
sure...but that was the end of my
career.“

After nine years of heavy
drinking during which she nearly
died. the toughness and strength
Muir still exhibits made it
possible for her to pull herself
together.

She contracted cirrhosis of the
liver and was given six months to
live. Muir got a divorce, stopped
drinking. and became the one out
of every 8.000 cirrhosis patients to
actually recover from the disease.

Her doctor gave her two cubic
centimeters of Vitamin B Complex
5 times per week. and in effect
rebuilt her liver.

“He says I did it and I say he did
it...I've been in perfect health ever
Since."

Muir feels that her first career.
as an actress, was unsuccessful.
This observation is not made only
in retrospect; she knew then that
she was not even close to
achieving what she had wanted as
anactress.   

Although she had attained some
degree of popularity. she was
never a major box office
attraction. (She was actually more
popular in England than in
America.)

"I wasn‘t being allowed to
develop as a human being or as an
artist...You think to be a star in
films is to be a success. but I never
felt that way."

After her divorce and recovery
from cirrhosis in 1959. Muir tried
to act again. She was virtually
starting from the bottom again.
and soon found that she did not
care to go through all of "the
wearing out of shoe-leather“ once
again.

She trained herself to teach and
began her first permanent job in
Stephens in 1968.

Muir developed a design for
teaching acting in a liberal arts
college (as opposed to a
professional conservatory) which
attempts to increase the students
self-awareness and awareness of
others and the sharpening 01' “10
five senses.

She believes that this increased
self-awareness. along with other
disciplines of the theater such as
punctuality. concentrating 0“
completion of the job at hand, and
cooperating with others will
enable them to take a "more
mature. more sensitive human
being” with them into whatever
field they enter.

She does not often look back on
her life. either with regret or pride-
except to learn from the past in
order to move ahead.

Glancing backward is "a sheer

By JON LAFAYETTE
nd God said: “Let there be
lips."
Let me apologize. if I
may. (And you may). I did
miss five of the nine
showings of the Rocky Horror
Picture Show when it played here
on campus last weekend. You‘ll
have to take my word thatl wasn‘t
doing any school work.

But if you were there on
Thursday night. or at the 9:00 p.m.
show on Saturday. you probably
heard me tell Brad to kick the tire.
ask Riff Raff “which way." plead
not to see the family pictures.
complain about having meatloaf
again. and ask "Hey Janet. wanna
fuck?“

Brad did kick the tire. Riff Raff.
as predicted. pointed: “this way."
We saw the family album. We ate
meatloaf (what's the matter
Columbia, you've eaten Eddie
before). and Janet stared
indignantly into the audience
before deciding that she‘d "tasted
love and she wants more.“ More.
more. more.

“How many times did you see
it?“

I first saw Rocky Horror when
lFG showed it in February.
Friends (‘2) warned me to bring
rice. toast. and matches. I did.

I threw the rice. 1 lit my match.
And I would have thrown my toast.
but I couldn't get it out of my
pocket in time. I loved it. but what
amazed me was that the audience
seemed to anticipate action and
dialogue. by shouting out
instruction and comments on what
was going to happen on the screen.
It was the first audience
participation movie l'd ever seen.
The audience and the film together
made the show more than a movie,
but an experience.

i wanted to know where 1 could
get a copy of the “audience's
script" that must have come with
the film. After all. all those people
couldn‘t just have memorized the
movie and known what to yell out
in unison. At least not in Albany.

1 asked the projectionist if he

Lhad a copy of the script. but he said

APRIL 7, 1978

that there was none. I was shocked
to find out that all those people (in
Albany!) has seen the movie
enough times to be able to give a
show like that. I wanted more.
more. more. more.

Over Easter there was an ad in
the Post announcing that Rocky
Horror was going to be shown in
Queens at midnight (50 cents off
with this ad). The bottom of the ad
mentioned something about
charter buses coming from
Christopher Street in Greenwich
Village. I grabbed some rice. toast.
a flashlight and a friend (who had
never seen it). babbling something
about audience participation and
transvestites. He went anyway. It
would be a night they would
remember for a very. long. time.

While it might nothave been The
Waverly Manhattan. or
Uniondale‘s Mini-Cinema. the
meccas for the Picture Show. more
than our share of true believers
were there.

People came dressed up as
characters from the movie. Frank
N. Furter. Magenta. Columbia.
Eddie. Brad. and Janet (Weiss!)
were all well represented in the
audience. in addition to yelling out
lines. they actually acted out their
parts. Someone in the crowd
caught the Janet‘s bride‘s bouquet
and showed off her ring. someone
else blew Eddie's sax solo. Several
Columbia‘s tap danced. most ofthe
audience put a newspaper over
their heads to protect themselves
from the i'ain.(some even had the
Plain Dealer) and at least fifty
people got. up to do the time warp.

After seeing a show like that. I
wanted more. More. more. more.

i picked up the sound track
album and played it 50 times that
week in anticl...

Say it.

...pation for last week's nine
shows.

I was dissappolnted after seeing
the line of people waiting to get
into the first show on Thursday.
They looked normal. obviously a
group of first-timers.

Once inside. I found that I was
right. Few people bought rice at

the candy table. few called for the
lips to appear. and no one knew
when to lick them.

So from the back row. (yea back
row) I did my best to show the
rookies what the 'Show' was all
about by shouting out all the lines
I knew. I must have added
somethong to the movie, because
several people thanked me
afterwards. You're too kind.

Each progressive. showing
brought a better crowd. until at
midnight people came dressed in
corsets. stockings. garter belts.
high heels. leather jackets.
sequins. and whiteface. The
Saturday show just as good as I
had plenty of compnay filling in
the gaps in the film‘s dialogue.

The film itself is a product of the
obviously sick mind of Richard
O'Brian. He wrote the original
music and lyrics played. the
screenplay portrayed. the mad
scientist's assistant and also sung
the title song “Science
Fiction/Double Feature."

This movie is a musical. yes a
musical. It features some great
rockers. toetappers and
handclapping. and also introduces
Meatloaf in the role of Eddie.
You've got to catch some of the
lyrics to really appreciate what is
happening.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show
stars Tim Curry as Frank N.
Furter. a scientist who's just a
sweet transvestite from
Transsexual Transylvania. that
is. the planet Transsexual in the
galaxy ol' Transylvania.
(Hungary. you're safe.) Curry
overacts woundei'fully by singing.
bumping and grinding his way in-
to the hearts of the audience.

He's been building a man. with
blonde hair and atan. to relieve his
tensions and Brad (the hero) and
his fiancee Janet (Weissl) show up
at the castle after gettingaflat and
having had air in the spare
(asshole) on the night when
Frankies was going to bring his
creation (Rocky) to life.

Stripped of their clothes. Brad
'and Janet witness Rocky's birth.
stay for the night. are each. in turn.

creatures of the night by following
Frank Furter‘s vision of absolute
pleasure.

Riff Raff. Frank's handyman
and fellow Transylvanian. and his
sister Magenta kill the scientist
and return to Transylvania after
setting Brad and Janet free.

I don't know if the original Show
called for the alternate dialogue.
but I can't imagine the movie
without the audience
participation. I know Icouldn't see
it without yelling out “she went
apeshit" when Frank asks the
melodic question "What ever
happened to Fay Wray?." or
screaming “anybody got a towel"
when Janet explains that she
never got into heavy petting
because it only leads to seat
wetting.

There are many people who
think the movie is sick. or

complain that they can‘t hear
because of people yelling in the
audience. But I don't care.

I just heard IFG will be showing
the Horror Show again soon. and I
can’t wait to do the time warp
again.
