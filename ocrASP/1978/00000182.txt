“Man/Woman Mixed Canoe"

The Fifth Annual Tenandeho

Rolls Royce of canoe races.

phoned the Mechanicvilie Fire

the news to Deer.

way deeper into canoe country. As
we drew nearer to Mechanicville
we spotted more canoes. ’l‘he sigiit
rc minded me of what the last time I
drove northbound on the Thruway
during deer hunting season was
like. Dozens of doors were lashed
on to the trunks of hunters'
vehicles.

The race was to begin at noon.
near Coons Crossing just outside
of Mechanicville. off Route 67.
After turning onto the Crossing.
our wagon fell into a line ofcanoe-
laden vehicles. Two men in their
early thirties crossed in front of
our stopped car. The garb they
sported proved to be the standard;
it wct suit. candy colored life vest.
and vinyl gloves. A loudspeaker
was calling racers to the starting
line. advising them that all
participants must wear a US.
Coast Guard life jacket. “Shit.” I
muttered sullenly. We'd only
brought one preserver. Deer. who
has fashioned a life-style out of the
here and now. blandly told me not
to worry until we really had to.

Deer. following the hand signals
of a man in an orange blazer.
turned onto a muddy dirt road. For
a good forty yards. cars and small
trucks lined either side of what
was now a major thoroughfare for
canoe enthusiasts.

Canoes were everywhere. On the
ground. On roof racks. In the air.
For a moment i thought I'd stepped
into a canoe-cloning plant. Deer
steered our vehicle into the first
vacant space she spotted.

After a few minutes of puttering
about. contemplating unloading
our canoe. watching others do so.
etc.. we checked in at the
registration tent and promptly
discovered that the fears i had
expressed just a few minutes ago
were. in the words of one
contemporary psychologist.
"reality based." A race official told
us bluntly that we could not race
unless each of us were a preserver.
As a courtesy she announced
blithely over the loudspeaker that

one of the racers was in need of a
life jacket. No response; not even
curiosity seekers wishing to set

eyes on a novice. My judgement
was too hasty. An old man inched
toward Deer. “Have you done
much of this before?" Deer told
him she was one quarter Indian. as
if that answered his question.

"I damned near broke every
bone in my body two years ago.
during this race." said the man. his
wife‘s facial expression
confirming the man's story.

That must have been in the third
annual race. I mused. Where was i
going to get a preserver‘? Even if
somebody did have an extra.
they‘d be a fool to cough it up.
Chances were that they'd never get
it back. ltacers were running
against the clock. not each other.
With all the starts staggered. I‘d be
hard pressed to find my benefactor
at the finish ol‘ the day‘s event.

loyalty to one's gear is rare even
among outdoorsman.

A minor altercation was
occuring inside the registration
tent. While I was away. Deer had

race was being cancelled (due to
the fact thatythe 'l‘enandeho was a

unless a would-be-racer coughed
up his life preserver. She‘s of
Indian descent. I told the irate race
officials. in an effort to clarify her
behavior. When the police ill'l‘lVCd
Deer tried to pawn the whole thing
off as a practical joke. "You know
officer. I‘ve always wanted to go
into broadcasting." she told an
amused cop as he escorted us to
our car.

We sat in the front seat of the
station wagon. cut off from one
another by the nose end of our
canoe. My rage now bubbllllgUVCI‘.
I berated myself for my stupidity.

music you give
yourself a little first. get
out to where the people
are. bring the music to
them. If you want to make it as a
streetsinger. you've got to make
yourself available.“

Stephen Baird. streetsinger
extraordinaire, somewhat—famed
open-air minstrel of Boston
Commons. known in the trade as
the man who legalized
streetsinging in Boston. has been
making his music and himself
available to people for the past
seven years. Last Friday. Baird
made himself available to the
Albanycommunity on the SUNYA
campus. singing on the podium. in
the Quad cafeterias. and on Friday
and Saturday nights at the Freeze
Dried Coffeehouse.

Baird. 5’2" and 100 pounds. sat
amid 80 pounds of battered
guitars. dulcimers. kazoos.
instrument cases. and busted
guitar strings in the early spring
afternoon and played. sang. told
stories to hundreds of SUNYA
students for hours.

Sitting astride an old guitar case
and picking his twelve string.
Baird sang. jumped up and down
and made faces. all the time
making people smile. He coaxed
and cajoled the crowd into coming
closer. sitting down. loosening up.
and finally singing along to
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo" and
"Wiiere is 'l‘liumpcr.” Baird
himself providing the
audio/visual special effects.

“It's spring. you've got a license
to be weird." Baird told the crowd.
"Stamp your feet. nod your head.
blink your eyes. do anything you
feel like. O.K.. get out your key
chains. it's time for a key solo.”
Baird then swung into an
energetic version of "if You're
Happy and You Know it.“

"To be a good streetsinger.
you've got to do more than play
songs.“ Baird said later. "You've
got to be able to come out to people.
loosen them up. and make them
feel comfortable. You‘ve got to get
them involved with the process of
doing music."

Baird considers himself more of
an entertainer than it straight

belong. I let people play with my
instruments. let the kids wear my
hat. answer people‘s questions
about streetsinging."

Although Baird seeks to involve
himself with his audiences
wherever he might be. whether in
Minnesota. Michigan or Albany.
he feels most involved in his home
town. Boston.

"'l‘here's a community there and
i'm part of it." Baird said. “i have a
following there. and that‘s
important to streetsinging. 'l‘he

sometimes for six hours.
sometimes for twelve. depending
on the crowd and the weather. He
makes about $25 a day on the
average. but has made up to $150
on his best summer days.

“In the winter it can get pretty
cold in Boston.“ said Baird.
“Minneapolis is nice in the winter.
they have all these glassed-in
bridges where streetsingers
congregate and play; the people
out there love acoustic music."

But very few places love
streetsingers. In many towns and

cities. streetsingers are equated‘

with panhandlers. vagrants. and
other “undesirables.” Although
few states have laws prohibiting
streetsinging. most do have laws
against soliciting or begging. and

Music Council in Washington.

foyer. doing his street routine just
like any other day. except with his
guitar case closed because he was
being paid a set fee.

“Someone in the audience stuck

_ a plastic cup with a dollar in
it in front of me. and in no time. the
money was overflowing on the
carpet all around me. Well. as soon
as they saw that. the cops walked
over and grabbed me for
soliciting. right in front of
hundreds of people. including the
entire National Music Council.
There was a lot of yelling and
booing. and I wasn‘t arrested. All
that and I hadn‘t done or said a
thing."

As an anti-Vietnam chemical
engineering student at
Northeastern University during
the late sixties. Baird went on

may or may not be construed as

"A law that can be interpreted
like that is just as effective as one
against streetsinging itself.“
Baird said. "How can i afford to
sing in the streeteight hours aday
if i can't receive money for it?"

Though he's never been arrested
himself. many of his friends and
follow streetsingers have. and
Baird has been hassled many
times by police and localofficiais.

streetsinging.

with either anymore. I turned to
music as my language. and you
can‘t be a part-time musician. sol

Baird considers himself a

what he does. He sees no reason
why streetsinging shouldn‘t be
recognized as an alternative
profession to becoming a lawyer
or a factory worker.

a showcase he did at a Regional,
Convention of the National
Entertainment Campus Activities
Association four years ago.

“You go there and for anywhere

schools at a whack. It's very
competitive. and can be a
brutalizing experience. but it's
worth it if you can get thirty or
forty bookings out of it."

Baird put together a whole
promotional package out of that
showcase that he sends around the
country. He is currently on an
eight-week tour that will take him
through a number of SUNY
campuses. Then he'll take a week
off before he leaves on a twelve-
week tour of the Midwest.

During that week off. Baird
intends to return to the University
of Michigan in Anne Arbor. "I was
there last year. and I only played
for about four or five hours.In that
time. a crowd of over 500 people
gathered. and they gave me more

letters. poems and pictures from
people who were there. I promised
those people I would come back
and stay longer . . . I have an
obligation to repay that kind of
intensity.“

Friday afternoon. Baird played
in several Quad cafeterias during
mealtime. when people had to
make excuses for walking by to
listen to him. like getting food they
didn‘t really want to eat. He sang a
couple of songs; ".lust enough l0
get people interested. not enough
to intrude."

Performing at the Freeze Dried
Coffeehouse. Baird was surely the
most entertaining act to play the re
in recent months. yet one couldn't
help feeling that nobody was
going to play with his instruments
while he sat on that stage; that no
old bum was going to dance to “Mr.
Bojangles" no matter how well he
played it. The tendency was there
to scream. “Get the hell back out
on the street. Stephen. and open
your guitar case. and here's a
potato."
