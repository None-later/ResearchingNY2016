By DENNIS SCHEYER
et‘s not waste any time
with the usual intro. You
know who Elvis Costello
is by now. While he may
not yet be as common as
Whirlpool fryers or Frigidaire
refrigerators. he's getting there.
In fact. This Years Model is his
new album. It features a 440 four-
barrel. gold hubcaps and more of
the same great rock and roll.
The cover. as usual. is
mesmerizing. Elvis is captured
posing behind his favorite
invention. a camera. On the back
he is ' seen flying through a
window- “Superman style." As for
the innersleeve. that I'll let you see
yourself.
"No Action“ opens the album

 

, with a pessimistic "anti-love“
theme..._‘.‘l don't wanna kiss ygu. I
' don't wanna touch. I don't wanna
see you, I don't miss you that

What can you start doing NOW in order to
increase your chance of being recruited by
Public Accounting firms when you
graduate? It takes more than a good Grade
Point Average. Interested? If so. come to the
presentation by:

Michael Cam bell
Price Waterhouse 8s 0. Recruiter
speaking on:

 

“How to prepare

yourself for the

profession of Public
Accounting.”

Date: April 11, 1978 (Tuesday)
Place: Lecture Center No. 1
Time: 6:15 - 7:30 p.m.

 

much,...Every time I hold you I
just wanna putyou down." Elvis is
definitely bitter about a past love
affair.

“You Belong to Me“ is a further
emulation of 60‘s rock. Elvis says
"He doesn‘t just want anybody.“

“Hand In Hand“ starts out with a
spirit-type opening. featuring
surrealistic vocals and a
synthesizer. possibly making for
the hit single of the album.

Elvis‘ answer to "Less than
Zero“ on This Years Model is
“Radio Radio." He says that it is in
bad hands. Talk about biting the
hand that feeds youll

Enough said. The new album is
good. My Aim is True should be
gotten first however. then after
putting some mileage on it get
This Years Model.

of demon rockers who spew forth
fiery music from the very bowels
of hell. Armed only with
amphetamines and electronic
amplification. they sing of such
relevant themes as war. drugs.
death. and clbse encounters of the
third kind. Their audiences tend to
be underage. and their head
singers tend to resemble shrill-
screaming malnourished
skeletons. perhaps as some
persuasion of symbolic gesture in
the manifestly evil blood-bath of
hell-fire rock and roll.

And whereas the quality of
amphetamines seems to have
gone downhill in the past few
years. the quality of electronic
amplification. not to mention
recording techniques. has
increased exponentially in both
clarity and power. The production
controls are handed over to Judas
Priest and the result is a. very
powerful. very slick. hard-rock
recording. From the
technical/stamina perspective.
Stained Glass is the ultimate
heavy-metal recording.

But even the most slick and
powerful of recordings requires
something more than sheer energy
and expertise alone be it from hell
or direct-current.

That is not to say that Stained
Glass is without its appeals. Some
people seem to enjoy loud,
inherently'1'evileongs dealing
with topics such as "Saints- in
Hell" and “Behond the Realms
of Death.“ Such are particularly
popular among the early teen set
since they tend to drive parents
up-a-wail.

But regarding the audience
addressed on this occasion;
Stained Glass is of no interest and
Judas Priest minimal. The
sophisticated musical tastes of
anyone over sixteen would find
their approach both obnoxious
and immature. Once one has
grown out of Black Sabbath. there
is no need for regression of
musical tastes. There is no new
listening experience acquired
from Judas Priest. only a cheap
reminder of something not worth
remembering.

' Constantine ordered an
end to all gladiatorial

not enforced. The shows

economic and political decline of
the empire put an end to the
entertainments of the arena.

E. There is a widely held belief that
 Christian martyrs were put to
 death in the Colosseum. This
belief is not strongly supported by
historical fact. but has been
romanticized in fiction and art.
The Colosseum is now a Christian
shrine and the site of an annual
service. A large cross has been
erected where an imperial box was
once located. Of the Christian
martyrs believed to have perished
in the Colosseum the most famour
is St. Ignatius of Antioch. whose
death occurred 160 AD.

In the Middle Ages the building
was used as a fortress. It also was
the subject of much speculation: it
was counted among the seven
wonders of the world. and Virgil
was believed to have designed it.
More than any other monument it
represented the pagan past of the
city.

admired it most did most to
destroy it. Peter Brueghel's
painting of “The Tower of Babel"
(1563) was clearly inspired by the
Colosseum.

In the 17th and 18th centuries
there were plans to build within
the Colosseum a church in honor
of the martyrs. (Michelangelo had
already built the magnificent
church of Santa Maria degli
Angeli within the ruins of the
Baths of Diocletian.) Only lack of
funds kept those plans from being
realized. Goethe did some
sketching in the Colosseum. and
Lord Byron called it a "noble
wreck in ruinous perfection."

In the middle of the 19th century

Mussolini. who consciously
exploited antiquity to glorify his
regime. tore down the buildings
around the Colosseum and created
a splendid vista. He also created a
gigantic traffic island. and today's
automobile traffic has become a
threat to the celebrated ruin. It is a
strange custom of today’s Romans
to race their cars. amid loud
honking. around the Colosseum
when they celebrate a wedding. At
least one may assume that the
devils and evil spirits once
haunting the place have all been
frightened away by the noise.
