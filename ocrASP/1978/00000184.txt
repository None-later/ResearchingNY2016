covered. bring it to my attention.
Unsupported by the facts
concerning the membership and input
policies of student groups. the
accusation of institutional racism
reads like a cheap shot written by
people who should know better. As a
former Torch editor. Ron Simmons
should be well aware of Torch
policies. but apparently he is not.

ch-ch-changes

To the Editor:

Dave Mason once wrote:
Watching changes in season
ain't nearly so pleasin' as watching
the changes in you...

The changes here at SUNYA are
amongst the most pleasin' in the
country. for the weather we‘re
changingfromis amongstthe nation‘s
most despicable. and the springtime it
leads into is amongst the most
pleasant in the country. As the faces
slowly emerge from behind the
snorkel hoods. we realize that not only
are the visages we once knew. but
that they are smiley faces. They are
beaming at' the geiser-like flow of
water gushing up to the sky from the
fountains; they are ecstatic because of
the free beer and ice cream given to
them in frontofthe campus center; and
they're finally realizing that the faces
that stare back at them are the reason
for being here.

The faces. The changes. The people.
Sort of makes you put your constant
concern for marks in perpective.

To the Editor:

I have come to the conclusion that
the Albany Student Press should be
renamed the Albany Syndicate. it is
run by a few and mighty students who
think that they can print any words
they want. even if those words aren‘t
their own.

Over one week ago. I wrote a story
on Dave Gold which presented both
the humorous and serious sides of the
SA president. It was being laid out for
Focus Magazine in the ASP offices.

An Apology

heinbaum and Focus. and best wishes

for the success of SUNYA's newest publication-

Focus and the ASP to use the}
facilities.

On Monday. April 4. five days afterl
had written and handed in my article.
the ASP came out with its April Fool‘s
issue entitled. “Kiok-in-the-ASP." It
should haVe been called Kick-i’n-the
Face." because that is exactly what it
did to me and my story.

There in its seventh page was a
parody on Kathy Baron. the SA vice-
prosident. Its opening line was. "He
sits on a swivel chair behind a desk
cluttered with letters to Helen Gurly
Brown..."

My story's first paragraph begins.
"He sits on a. swivel chair behind a
desk full of cluttered papers..."

Then the next eight paragraphs go
on to take specific ideas and phrases
from my article. The similarities are
obvious to all who have read both
stories. and I hope to all who will read
the Gold story in Monday‘s Focus
Magazine. Plagiarism is "to steal or
purloln and pass off as one‘s own
(ideas. writings. etc.. of another)."
according to Webster‘s. 11‘s a word
some of the ASP editors should write
500 times on their blackboards every
night before they go to sleep.

There‘s no doubt in anyone‘s mind as
to who the people responsible are. The
self-proclaimed authors called it a
"thoughtless" act on their behalf.

Where the editor-in-chief of the only
student newspaper on campus had the
time to be “thoughtless” is beyond my
comprehesnsion. I can hardly fault the
writer of the article. for any buffoon
can hand in a story on any subject. But.
it takes an editor's approval to put it
on the presses. _

i understand they were all under a
lot of pressure to put out a “funny”
story. Some people just can‘t think
clearly when there's a deadline
hanging over their head.

Well. my only thought on Mr.
"I".ditor-ln-Chiei“‘ Is that he‘s in the
wrong line of work. if he and his
colleagues are going to commit
plagiarism every time they face a
pressure deadline. they should think
about resigning their positions.
Perhaps a non-pressure profession.
such as knitting. would suit them
better. In any case. it‘s about time
someone gave them a “Kick-ln-the—
ASP."

Loss of Diversrty. ;. .~ . - ,  .

The sailing club will still no more. The Outing Club will be
taking their tentsand gear and go camping out by the Indian.
Quad Lake. There will be no more intense solos from the
Jazz- Society. These are some of the clubs which are the
victims of cutbacks mandated by the SA Budget Committee.

The loss of these clubs lessens the diversity that Student
Association can provide for the SUNYA student. SA policy
this year has leaned more toward supposedly “mass
programing" projects like the Record Co-op. and toward
establishing for itself a. Murdoch-like role, with the array of
new publications it has chosen to fund. '

The philosophy behind this is that more students will
benefit from an on—campus co-op than a specialized club
with about 30 members. While this argument has merit.
where will it eventually lead to? Will SA be the owner of
four or five businesses and not much else in a few years?
Will students interested in becoming a part of an extra-
curricular activity. something to divert their time from
acedemics. be told that SA doesn’t have much to offer them.
but they could go down and hang out at a jeans co-op if
they‘d like?

. . And the Student Tax

SA‘s recent hack job cannot be attributed to philosophy
alone. For the past nine years, SA has been asked to work
within the same basic budget because the student tax has
remained the same. It doesn’t take a financial whiz to see
that costs have skyrocketed in that time. In order for SA to
be able to provide equal services and avoid stagnation with
possible new projects. it is essential that the student tax be
raised.

It is also essential that SA watch
"doling out. Not only the $500 budgets of clubs. For instance,
one-thi rfd of thdanticipatedfgain if theastu‘dent-tax is raised
from $66 to $70 next'year was lost on the Student Dwellings
flop. This type of thing should be carefully monitored from
adminsitration to adminsitration. This year’s programs
should not be next year’s losses.

For SA‘s sake. the student tax should be raised in next
week’s referendum. And for the student’s sake. SA should
ensure that the money is wisely spent.
