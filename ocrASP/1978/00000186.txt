The Semi-Tough Eggs
defeated Mitochondria last
Sunday to w in the intramural
co-ed volleyball champion-
ships

Semi-Tough got off to a fast
start. capping a 15-3 first
game vistory. Playing
inspired, so as to offset the
early season ions of star
player Sue Polls. Semi-
Tough's Btu Greenberg‘s
powerful serves and Chuck

Morov's all out hustle was the
difference. _

The champion Eggs jumped
out to a 7-1 lead in the second
game due to the strong
spiking of Steve Zeidman and
Jeff Greenberg. and the all-
around floor play of Sally
Ehlenberger and Teri
Reasoner.

Capture Lead

Mitochondria fought back to
capture an 8-7 lead. Aided by
the clutch serving of Karen
Hamilton. Semi-Tough Eggs

The most
effective
tampon

is the most

economical,
tOO

Tarnan tampons are
made with a special,
highly compressed
material to give you
maximum absorbency.
What’s more, unlike
most other brands,
they expand in all three
directions — length,
breadth and width - to
conform to individual
body contours. Which
means there’s far less
chance of leakage or
bypass.

And here’s some-
thing else you’ll like
about Tampax
tampons: the price.
The economy-size
package of 40 costs
less — tampon for
tampon—than any
other brand.

So if you want a lot
of protection at very
little cost, open a
package of Taman
tampons. We promise
you, it’s there.
