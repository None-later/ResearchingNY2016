BUFFALO. NY. (AP) This is a
tale of two coaches. For Hubie
Brown it was the best of

seasons. For Cotton
Fitasimmons. it was the worst
of seasons.

Charles Dickens aside.
Brown cajoied and badgered
one of the National Basketball
Association’s least-talents
teams. the Atlanta. Hawks.
into the playoffs. while
Fitzsimmons saw a preseason
playoff promise belied by a
near-endless string of
injuries.

After the Hawks stumbled
past the Braves. 87-74.
Wednesday night to clinch a
playoff berth, the two coaches
pondered their respective
fates.

"At the beginning of the
season. i said if this team wins

I

40 games. we should get in the
Georgia Hall of Fame. This
has. been a miracle." said
Brown. an intense. husky-
voiced veteran coach.

"There's been a quote that
we‘ve carried with us all year.
it‘s from Calvin Coolidge. and
it‘s a helluva quote.“

Brown paused for effect.

.then said. “There is nothing

more common than
unsuccessful people with
potential."

He allowed himself a rare
smile.

"Our goal was to be
successful withoutpotentlal."

Across the hall.
Fitzsimmons. a garish dresser
who at 5-foot-7 is a coupe
inches shorter than Brown.
drew slowly from a pop can
and sighed.

“It's been tough  real
tough. We start out the sosnony
.Tiny Archibald got hurt.
Okay. we nude somei'

adjustments. and i thought we
were recovered. Swen Nater
has to play with bad ribs. John
Shumato is traded. Then
Marvin Barnes has problems.
Billy Knight gets hurt. And

tonight. Randy Smith gets

hurt. it could drive you craay."

A couple of Fitasimmons’
players requested anonymity.
then began unleashing their
frustration verbally.

“Look at what Hubie's done.
They've only got twq players.
John Drew and Armand Hill.
and they‘re beating us. Hubie
wins because he has a
coaching concept. He teaches
teamwork and defense. Cotton
doesn‘t do that."

Another player said. "We
needed help all year because
of the injuries. but the team
didn't pick up anybody. They
wouldn't spend any money."

Fitzsimmons didn't flinch
when the statements were
repeated to him.

"I know the players have a
lot of frustration. and it‘s
always going to be directed at
someone. I know that."

Fitzsimmons wouldn‘t
criticize the Braves‘
management. but he knows a
coach who wins only 28 games
does not have what's known as
security.

“As long as my peers thinkI
can coach. that's all i worry
about. i left a good job to come
here. director of personnel for
Golden State. and i can get a
good job when i leave."

sophomores Jerry Janu-
snewski. Larry Pearson.
Rich Lovinson. Matt Crank.
and Joe Rajczak. the Albany
State junior varsity baseball
team is seeking revenge on
last year‘s 4-7 record.

“Overall we'll be strong
defensively." said Pups' head
Coach Jack Sedlicki. Albany
has excellent speed ii iii",
outfield and freshman
shortstop Andy Dym should
help pull the infield together.

School graduate. grabbed All-
Division honors in his senior
year.

Sedlickl feels his pitching
staff is,strong. headed by
righthanders Janusaewski
and Richie Woods.
