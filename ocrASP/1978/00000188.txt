 A Confident Pitcher

continued.me page twenty
“We couldn't get timely

\hits." said Muldoon. “The

opportunities were there. but

the bats didn't come through. I
guess I could resent some of
the guys for not backing me up
with some hits. but I have
some great friendships on this
team. As long as I know I did
my best possible job. I‘m
satisfied."

By losing so many games by
one run. the Danes are at
somewhat of a crossroad. is it
that the players are not good
enough to come out on top. or
is it that the coaches do not
extract the full talent from
each player? Muldoon sees the
dilemma from two sides.

“Our team is pretty good. We
have some talented Division

III players. and we can be
competitive with almost
anyone. Coach Burlingame
knows everything there is to
know about baseball. He’s
great at strategy.“
Bees Problem

With talented players and a
qualified coach. there is
seemingly no explanation for
the Danes“ failures. Muldoon
sees one problem thatcould be
a source for the doldrum fall
season the team went through.

“Coach Burlingame doesn‘t
have that extra spark. The
team is not as motivated as it
could be. Also. the team hasn‘t
executed the plays he gives us.
Then it‘s the coach who comes
out looking bad."

Looking ahead. Muldoon
sees an uncertain future. He is

planning to transform the

University of Florida next 5

year for a variety of reasons.
“The weather in Albany is for
the birds.“ complained
Muldoon. “I'm an outdoor
person. and I love the warm
weather. Florida also has an
excellent Division I baseball
program. I'm not sure if I'm
going to play there. but at least
it's available)"

A career in baseball is. for
now. extremely doubtful. The
game still has a great deal to
offer. but Muldoon is not as
gung-ho as he once was.

Professional Offer

"If I got a professionsal
offer. I‘d take it." said
Muldoon. “I used to think of
playing professionally. but
lately I‘ve lost some interest. I
really don't want my life
revolving around baseball.
I‘m too much of a free person
for that."

Nicklaus Likes Tourney Chances

AUGUSTA. Ga. (AP) By his
own calculations. Jack
Nicklaus figures to have a 50-
50 chance of winning the 42nd
Masters golf tournament.

But young Jerry Pate. still
thankful that he ignored a
doctor who wanted to extract a
rib and outdueled a hypnotist
over a steak last year. was
among77 challengers anxious
to test Nicklaus‘ prediction as
the tournament opened
yesterday at the Augusta
National Golf Club.

Nicklaus is not one to make

rash statements. even though
five times and is the favorite
he has won this event a record
virtually every time he plays
in one of the four major
tournaments.

On the eve of this event.
though. he offered this careful
assessment: “In the last 15
Masters. excluding my first
one as a pro and my three as an
amateur. I've felt probably 10
times that I've come in here
playing as well as I can. I won
half of those times.

“Now my game is better

There's more. He is off to his
best start ever. having won
twice and finished; second
twice in his last four starts. He
is rested yet tuned. haing
bypassed the last two tour
events and played several
practice rounds at Augusta.
He points toward the major
tournaments the others are the
PGA and the US. and British
Opens. He was beaten by Tom
Watson twice last year. here at
the British Open. It has been
two years since he won the last
of his 14 “Big Four." events.
Other top contenders in the

are PGA champion Lanny
Wadkins. four-time Masters
runner-up Tom Weiskopf.
Hale lrwin. Ray Floyd. Ben
Crenshaw. Lou Graham and
David Graham.

A player who also figures to
be in the chase is Pate. the 24-
year-old Floridan who shot to
the top of the pack by winning
the 1976 US. Open. then was
plagued by arm injuries last
year. He is healthy again. and
wants another major title.



 

 
 
  

    

Ringers at Albany State? You’ve. heard of them   ;
“my”? '

Park. but at times it's no diff'erentat University

A.M.I.A. basketball intramiirale tale place; 5.
A little over a week ago I heard offlve guys who edit
an entire team. An A.M.l.A. reterie and afew player-i from other
A.M.I.A. clubs were the ringers. «They- lost. but that's not
important. ‘

And that their opponents knew and didn't care thatthey were
playing is surprising. but isn't important. either. But what is
important is that the refs at the game had no idea that they were
being taken. That's the problem and it should be dealt with.

A.M.l.A. knows the simple solution. They have recommended
in the past and this season also. that all basketball players bring
their ID's to their games. Referees will check the ID's with the
team's roster and look for any discrepencies.

If a person's name isn't on ateam's roster after the third game.
he can't play. Simple as that.

But a recommendation from A.M.I.A. is not what's needed. A
firm rule should be established by the A.M.l.A. Council. and if
it‘s too much of a burden for a player to bring his l.D.. then he
shouldn't play anyhow. Laziness does not win ballgames. If he
forgets. he‘ll remember the next time.

As for the refs. it will involve a little more effort on their part
also (bringing rosters to the game). but it's a precaution that can
only be successful.

If the refs and the A.M.l.A. Council want to have gamesso
one-sided because of ‘illegal' talent. or run an iOOO-player
league without integrity, then they should continue in the
future with the status—quo.

 

Tonight. the League II basketball championship game will be
held. The Rim Jobs face the B. B.Bombers for the title. and of
course the coveted tee-Shirt.

The League I. III and IV hoop championships are scheduled for
Sunday night. Check the intramural board for exact times.

Remember the NCAA basketball playoffs? Well. the League 1
hockey playoffs has caught the same fever — upset feverthatls.
Just ask the victims.
