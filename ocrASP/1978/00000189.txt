RP] capitalizes After Early Deficit;

Goggin-V Nets Two Goals For 0-2 Danes

by Eddie linemen

In a varsity lacrosse game
played under weather
conditions usually reserved
for ,Albany State Football
games—windy and cold. the
Danes were defeated 13-5
Wednesday by the visiting
RPl Engineers.

it was Albany‘s second
straight loss of the young
season.after a 10-6 beating by
Oneonta last Saturday.

Early Lead

The Danes took an early 1-0
lead when attacker Steve
Miller shot one past RPi
goalie Ken Switay with only
one-minute elapsed in the
contest.

But after that. RH took
control and set the tempo for
the remainder of the game.

An aggressive defense and a
strong attack led to a Tom
Ryan goal three minutes later
which knotted the score at
one-all. RPI took a 2-1 lead at
6:15 of the first period as Dana
Manners bounced one in past
Albany‘s Gary Miller. RPI had
some more chances but only

   
 
 

Miller‘s play kept the score
down — for a while.

Albany finally returned to
the RPI end of the field. And
they made the best of it. Tom
Graziose fed teammate 'l‘om
Gisell who tied the score at2-2.

Albany then went into a
mental lapse and was sloppy
in their own end. RP]. not
wanting to pass up on Albany
mistakes. scored three quick
goals and the Engineers were
on their way.

The Danes got as close as 5-3
on a goal by Dan Goggin
opening up the second period.
But that was the last goal
Albany would get until the
final period. But by thattime it
was too late. -

RPl built up an eight-goal
lead and there was no way
Albany would make up the
difference.

Like First Loss
it was those "unsettled
situations". which Albany
coach Mike Motta credited
the Danes' first loss to. that
cost them Wednesday's game.
"it was the same thing." said

Motta. “We just weren't
picking up those ground balls
and we were committing a lot
of errors. both mental and
physical."

RPI. traditionally not a
tough team. had one
advantage. "They were a little
quicker than us." said Motta.
“But more than that is they
hustled more than we did."

Goggin again led the
Albany attack with two goals.

the fifth Dane goal.

For RPl. Ryan scored three

Baseball coach Bob

"the ace of the pitching staff.”
Muldoon agrees with his
coaches assessment. "1 have

where i am. and i think i
deserve to be on top."
Albany's ace pitcher has a
two-year career record of 3-8-

record is deceiving. The
