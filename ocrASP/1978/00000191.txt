SOVIETS EXPLAIN IT

Soviet scientists are reporting that
their own intensive, two-year study
of the so-called “Bermuda Triangle“
area has convinced them that there’s
nothing mysterious about the
triangle at all.

g A Soviet reasearch team says it
sent “an armada of ’ships“ into the
triangle area last year to search for
mysterious forces, adding that it
found nothing that could not be
explained.

The Soviets‘s Novesli News
Agency says that the triangle area
does have an unusual number of
giant, underwater whirlpools that
can be of signiﬁcant hazard to ships.
But it adds that these whirlpools are
common in other parts of the world
as well.

The Soviets dismiss all
paranormal explanations for
triangle disappearances, stating that
such theories are simply “indulging
in the human weakness for
sensationalism."

NEW ADDICTION

WHO’S COUNTING

Reports have been circulating for
years about persons in the Caucacus
Mountains of Russia and in the
Andes Mountains in Equador living
up to the age of I45.

Now The New York Times is
reporting that these stories seem to
be totally untrue. The Times says
that extensive new studies by
American medical teams. who have
examined the elderly people and
studied old birth records. have
concluded that most of the old-age
claims are fraudulent.

The study team reportedly found
that a man who claimed to be l27
was actually only 92. The researchers
say that the elderly villagers
perpetrate the myth of living to their
mid-IOO‘s for worldwide notoriety
and prestige.

Social Psychologists Jerald

'Jellison says that the average

American tells a whopping 200 lies
every day.

Now. according to a new book by
philosopher Sissela Bok. the art of
telling white lies and other libs has
characterized human interactions
since prehistoric time. The book is
entitled Lying.

Among the ZOO—odd lies we tell
each day are such untruths as "I’m
sorry. l'm late. I was tied up at the
ofﬁce." Philosopher Bok notes that
lying pervades every facet of daily
life. from doctors who prescribe
inactive “placebos” for theirpatients
to crusading reporters such as
Woodward and Bernstein who
employ deception in order to get to
the facts behind the story.

LIBERAL DECLINE

A survey of the nation‘s ﬁrst-year
college students has found that those

Leftists" now consider themselves
just “middlcr-of-the roaders."

current lirst-year students found
that 56.6 percent considered
themselves at the center of the
political spectrum.
. This was the highest ﬁgure for
middle-of-the-roaders in the l2-year
history of the survey by the
American Council on Education.
College students aren‘t necessarily
becoming more conservative,
however, according to survey
directory Alexander Astin. Astin
says that instead, “views that were
once considered liberal are now part
of the mainstream of opinion among
today's college freshmen."

WIN OR LOSE

The Federal Communications
Commission is reportedly preparing
to take unusually tough action
against the CBS Television Network
because of the network's alleged
fraud in connection with its I975 to
1977 sports shows titled "The
Heavyweight Championship of
Tennis."

CliS billed the tennis matches,
which featured the likes of Rod
Laver and Jimmy Connors. as
“Winner take all" events.

HE, SHE, OF! E?

An Associate Professor at the
University of California in Lon
Angeles is suggesting that people
begin replaciang the pronouns “he”
or“‘she" with a simple "E."

Professor Donald M'ackayfl “E.” he
says. is one solution in the search for
a non-sexist pronoun.

Mackay says the pronoun "he"
has always been used when the writer
meant to include both sexes. He
says, however, that he tested his
classes and found that 64 percent of
the students interpreted “he” as
referring to a man when it is used to
denote either sex.
