By EDWARD RADER

ith his quiet drawl and his

thumbs tucked under his red

suspenders. New York

Times columnist ’l'om

Wicker appeared every inch
the Southern gentleman us he sat in front
of il crowded Campus Center Assembly
Hall last Friday afternoon.

Wicker was not a commanding
speaker. his drawl being too quiet for
people to hear him in the back of the
room. but he answered questions fully
and thoughtfully for a little over an hour.
working without a prepared text. 'l‘rue.
SUNYA was just a stopover on a
speaking tour designed to pIUg Wickcr's
new book. and also true Wicker did
manage to mention the book a cottplc of
timcs ill his answers. Still. It was tln
lllltll'llltlllVL' and occasionally itlnttsing
hour.

In response to one oi the first questions
zlskcd. Wickcr admitted that some limcs
reporters may have had “contact with
L'lA ilgL‘lllS that was not proper.“ bttt ltc
did not think that it Wits. “it serious factor
II] tltc cditorlill policics ol papers."

Wicker defended the CIA as being “a
prime source of lnlormlttion in tile
world." adding that lilncs
corl'cspolldcnts llilVL‘ in the past been
hriclcd by ('l/\ ttgcnts before entering it
country. llo\tc\cr. according to Wickct‘.
the reporter always takes information
gncll him by the ('IA \slth "ll grain of
still."

\\ lckcr bellc\cs that it Is not the CIA.
ol illl) other source llllll cxcrts the most
plcssurc concerning what gets published
in ii newspaper. lnstclld. II is scll-

censorship that he calls “the biggest
danger to the free press in America."

“The press is a big business. Publishers
and editors like to be part of the
establishment; reporters need to have
access to information. and for a variety of
reasons the process works more nearly
toward the press having an accepted and
respectable place in the establishment.
Which means that in the natural case, it
doesn‘t rock the boat."

Not earth shaking news, but then
Wicker himself has never been known as
much of a bout rocker. His “In the
Nation“ column tends to run towards
liberal reﬂections and musings. rather
than taking a firm and definitch stand.
Following l’rcsidcnt Carter‘s election. the
most incisive commcnt hc had to offer
was that he felt the narrowncss of Carter‘s
Victory might inhibit his performance as
President. llowuvcr. he was far more
explicit in answering whether or not he
lclt that prediction had come true.

Wicker pointed out that Carter had
carried many states. especially thosc in
the South. by winning a majority of the
black votes in those states. Said Wicker:
“I looked at those figures and thought to
myself. ‘My God. the blacks rcally elected
that Icllzl. . . And that means he is really
going to put himself out for the blacks.
and do whatever it is that would solidify
himself with the blacks. Illllt‘s not what
hllppcncd at all. Carter took one look at
those returns and sttid. 'My (iod. I better
get right with the white lolks.‘ "

Someone asked him what cffcct the
\\ omen's movement has had on American
socicly and Wicker :llloxved himself a
personal rcl lcction. sputtking briefly of his
lt.'ll year marriage. di\orec, and

3 concludes Wicker, and must‘ofteli use his ' I ‘

subsequent remarriage to “a very brilliant
career woman. whose career has nothing
to do with mine. who is younger than'l
am. and who indeed is on the way up as I
am on the way down)? Wicker thought
for a moment and then said, “When men
and women deal with each other more or
less as equals. then it effects a profound
change in the way you look at life. in the
way you deal with yourself. the opposite
sex. your children. everything." , .

Although it got a few laughs, Wicker‘s
remark about being “on the way down“ is
probably not one that was made entirely in
jest. His new book on journalism has met
with mixed reviews. with people accusing
him of having nothing new to say about
journalism.

True or not. Wiskcr had perceptive
thoughts to offer his audience when
rcmindcd that one of his rules for a
reporter was to be “neither in nor out.“
“We say down South that every tub sits
on its own bottom. The serious point is
that it reporter‘s major problem is to gain
access to news sources. What do you
concidc." The example Wicker used to
illustrate his point was Kissinger. who he
called. “the foremost press manipulator
of our time." Kissinger, Wicker stated.
would not answer a reporter's calls if its
began to write stuffhe didn‘t likc. or if he
Were not within "the favored few.“

“A State Department rcportcr pretty
much had to play the game Kissinger‘s
wny. . . I think its bad that Kissinger
played it that way. bllt you‘ve got to take
the world the way you lind it. It was a
reporter‘s job to stay in. certainly it‘s no
good to be out. bill to stay in without
absolutely making a whore of himself.“

A reporter must walk a thin line.

judgement as to what serves the public
best. He cited a recent story of a womit't 1
journalist who got “involved” with 
source as an, example of deﬁnitely being
“too’ far in.” ‘ but on the other hand.
asserted-that “there isn‘t a reporter alive
who hasn't accepted a handout."
Wicker also bad advice for aspiring
young journalists, telling them not to go
to graduate school. but to “go out and get
a job oil a smaller paper. where you can
learn how to do all sorts of things." .

In answering the last question of the
hour. Wicker seemed to be suggesting
topics for those future journalists. The
question dealt with whether or not he felt
there was enough diversity of opinion
expressed in American newspapers.
Wicker said that he thought there was a
diversity of opinions. and that the more
serious problem is “our definition 'of
nch." There are it number of topics he
feels that the press does not cover.
l’risons. for example: “American prisons
don‘t exist in the American press. The
only stories you read about prisons deal
with riots. prison breaks. or other serious
disturbances.“ Other topics he feels are
not covered are schools. and mental
institutions. l he most grcvious deficiency
of all. in his opinion. is the fact that “the
American corporation does not exist in
the American press. . . l‘hc single
biggest factor that touches all of our lives
is American business. yet it is probably as
little covered as any othcr major function
in American life.“

. loin Wicker may not have l'ltld all the
answers. but he certainly knew the
questions.
