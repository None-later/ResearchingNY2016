Women’s Softball Team Is
Young; Three" _Returnees

by Irtsee Sleuths-

If you had to describe the Albany
State women's softball team in one
word, that word would be young.
Only three starters from last year's 4-
3 team are returning. and only two
other members of last year's squad
are back.

Leading the Danes this year will
be catcher Karen O‘Reilly. who led
last spring‘s team in batting with a
.684 average. The only senior on the
team is Marilyn Hinden. who saw
action last year at both ﬁrst baseand
pitcher. Debby Parker. who hit .308
last year as a freshman is the only
other returning starter.

The rest of the starting team will
include Gretchen Harig. who played
in the Amateur Softball Association
(a mammal organization). Camille
Binns, who was a member of the
team two years ago; Caroline
DeVito. a freshman who shows a lot
of promise at shortstop. and Nancy
Sapio. a transfer student who will see
action at pitcher.

Also slated as first stringers are
Cindy Warner, another transfer who
will play in the outﬁeld, and Judy

Treadway, a freshman who could
either play at pitcher, ﬁrst base, or
the outﬁeld. The battle for second
base is going on between Jeanice
Koronowski. a freshman who has
shown great improvement. and Ellen
McCormick. ,

The leadership on the team will
have to come from the returning
players. but the backbone of the
team will be the freshmen. according
to coach Lee Rhenish.

in her sixth year as coach. Ms.
Rhenish indicated that unless the
pitching staff comes through, the
team may ﬂounder. According to
Rhenish. the nucleus fora good team
is there. all that is needed now is a
good pitching staff.

The schedule this season is made
up of ten games. which is short
compared to such schools as Russell
Sage and Oneonta. the two teams
Rhcnish says the Danes will have to
heat or else there is “no sense in
going to a tournament."

Rlienish is excited about the new
players on the squad and expects a
lot of work out of the team as a
whole.

Linett is also very happy to be
under the wing ofcoach Bob Lewis.
His past coach at Union, lndeljit
Singh. was only a part-time coach,
and Linett found it hard to get the
help and guidance he needed.

“Coach Lewis is a very good
teacher." remarks Linett. "i like him
very much as a person and as a
coach. He tells me the things I'm
doing wrong and explains how to
correct them."

As for his future goals. Linett
