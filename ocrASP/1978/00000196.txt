Tokens had assured themselves of a
victory.

Ted "Spoon" Ferris, Steve Pass
and Audrey Brown each had ten
points for the winners. Wayne Flynn
of P0 Bah led all scorers with l4.
Craig Fields contributed eight points

though, the Bombers‘ Danny
Cooper (their leading scorer) hurt
his ankle and missed the remainder
of the game.
