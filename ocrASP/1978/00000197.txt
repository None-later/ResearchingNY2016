Whenever anyone discussed who
the best tennis player was at Albany
State. the name Paul Fcldman was
inevitably at the top of the list. Hut

now there‘s a new kid in town
challenging Feldman for that,
number-one spot. His name is Larry
Linett. and for the past few years he‘s
been the Jimmy Connors of the city
of Albany.

“I started playing tennis when l
was seven.“ says Linett. “i entered
my first tournament when I Wits
eight. I hadn‘t been playinglong. but
I won the tournament."

He opted for Albany Academy
instead of a regular public school
because of the quality of the
education. Unlike many athletically
inclined teenagers. he wanted to go
to a good academic high school.

Academy was sensational to say the
least. Iii his three years of
competition. he did not lose one of
his singles matches. His
accomplishments made him well
known on the tennis circuit.

“When I was I5. i went to a
tourney in New Jersey." recalls
Fcldman. “My friend pointed out
who Linett was. and lwalked by his
court just to say I was near him. At
the time. he was the best junior
player I had ever seen.“

Linett graduated high school a
year early and attended Union
College. While there. be compiled a
6-3 singles record. but he quickly
became disenchanted with the
school‘s tennis program.

“They totally frown upon athletics
there." says Linett. “Union doesn't
feel it can have good athletics
programs along with its good
academic program. They're afraid of
becoming a jock school.“

The Albany State spring baseball
season began with a whimper on
Saturday. The only banging came
from the RPI bats. which belted four
Dane pitchers to come away with a
i5-2 whitewash of visiting Albany.

Albany‘s early hopes were aroused

when Paul Nelson led off the game

with a single. The Danes‘ speedy
centerfielder promptly stole second
and third. but was stranded there as
the Dane bats could not bring him
home. This wasted opportunity was
the best chance Albany had to score
until the ninth inning. when the
game was no longer in doubt.

RI’I jumped on Dane starting
pitcher Ed 'Seiiers early. and went on
to score runs in every inning except
the third and eighth. The game was
lost in the second inning. when four
RPI hits and a few Albany err is
combined for four runs.

The usual steady Dane fielding
was erratic, mishandling many
chances en route to six costly errors.
Part of the problem was that starting
shortsop Al Grimaldi had an injured

Albany were many. but the main one
was the fine tennis program here. “I
wanted a good tennis program. but I
also looked for academic quality and
a school in the Albany area."

Linett realizes that he has very
tough competition in Fcldman for
the number-one spot. but he feels it
has to help both himself and
Fcldman. along with the team.

“It rctilly helps me to play him.“
explains Linett. “i think it improves
both of our games. We're pretty
close ability-wise. so on any given
day either one of us could win.“

“That's definitely true." agrees
Feldman. “Besides which it really
motivates me in practice because it
gives me competition that I never
had."

Both players have very strong ‘

games. Lin’ctt's strength lies in his
ground strokes. while Feldtnan's is
basically in his quickness.
Overall. Linett is happy to be
playing on the Albany tennis team.

in every category except one
scoring. RI'I’ liiid it slim .I-Z lead btlt
the game didn't belong to anyone.

Ilut that was soon changed. As the
totirtlt .period started. the
momentum swung over to the
Tigers. In it span of four minutes.
they scored four goals tojtist ttbottt
put the game out of reach.

Albany, however. had a say iii the
matter before It was all over. Dita
Goggin scored two quick goals and
teammate Ken German had one and
the Danes were trailing by only two.
7-5.

However. Albany was playing

shoulder and was limited to
designated hitter duties.

“No doubt ubot it. we were
ragged." stated baseball coach Bob
Burlingame. “We were not at full
strength. but we still made far too
many errors.“

Hitting Weak

True to form. the Dane‘s hitting
attack was a virtual nonentity. RPI
pitcher Bruce Bunin threw a
complete game. and did not‘walk a
butter until the ninth inning. Bunin's
mastery allowed the Danes a total of
three hits. all singles. After
(irimaidi‘s leadoff bit. the only other
Danes to add to their batting
averages were Chris Sicglcr and
Roger Planticr.

Pitching. a supposed strong point
for Albany. was anything but strong.
Sellers was chased after three innings.
and then the revolving door began to
move. Jim Bittkcr. Paul Cohen. arid
Bruce Dey all took turns giving tip
runs.

Steve Mttldoon. the Danc‘s top
hurler. did not see any action.
According to Burlingamc. Mtildoon

 

“didn‘t feel right in the Hudson
Valley scrimmage. and didn't seem
ready. He should pitch against
Hartwick on Wednesday."

The Danes scored their only two
runs in the ninth inning. Howie
Markowitz was hit by a pitch. Mike
Mirabella walked. and Dey reached
base on an error to load the bases.
Bruce Kaczmarek then hit a dribbler
down the third base line which was
not fielded cleanly. In the confusion.
two Albany baserunners crossed the
plate to save the embarrassment of
an opening day shutout.

"We're still a week away."
commented Burlingamc. "We didn't
have it Southern trip this spring. mid
that put us it hit tiff schedule. llie

Student SenateRole To BeDecided

by .Ittt Haber

Extending student membership
on the University Senate is an issue
which will be voted upon by the en-

tire SUNYA faculty this spring. and .

student senators are worried that the
extension won't be granted.

Student participation on the
senate is currently granted on the
basis of a provisional two year
membership. which can be con—
tinued for the next two years by it
majority "yes" vote of 20 per cent of
the faculty.

Students have been grtitited the
extension oti every refcrctidum since
they were first gratitcd protisional
membership in I969.

Students are supposed to
comprise about one-third of the
senate. Of their 33 seats—22
undergraduate and II graduate—
none of the graduate positions are
filled. although 20 other

undergraduate ones are.

According to Senate Chair
Donald Bishko. “the faculty believes
that the senate is less effective with
students on it. because they inhibit
faculty participation." He said he
would be voting against students
remaining on the senate so that
faculty participation would increase.

“Students tend to protect
themselves. They tend to look
carefully at bills. as ifwe‘re out to get
them.“ he said.

The senate acts in an advisory
capacity to the SU NY A president in
the formation of university-wide
policy. “Most of the policies passed
by the senate have gone through.“
said former Senate Chair Clara

membership was a privelage granted
to them. ‘

“Faculty has an inherent duty to
recognize our right to be on senate.“,
said student senator Jim Mitchell.
“Without represnetation l‘d feel like
it black person with Jim Crow laWs."

Student Senator Hugh Hill called
senate “the roost important govern-
ment body on this campus. As long
as the president heeds its wishes it is
the ultimate authority on this catn-
ptts. The only thing they don't con-
trol is UAS and Central Council."

“Faculty need some forum ol‘their
own." said Tucker.

“We deserve to be on it“ said
Hill. "It‘s a question ofprinciple. We
have the right to be rcprescitted on it
university body which makcs
policy."

According to Hill. most of the
policy formation is worked tittt oti
councils and committees of tire
sctiitic.

"I don‘t know of anybody even
talking about removing students
from councils or committees." said
i‘rill‘tk. “They would still vote on
them. Much of the importatit work is
done in councils and committees."

Report: Housing Inspections Lax

by Steve Bracketf

I‘ollowing itit l8 month investiga—
tioti into the circuiiisttiiices surrouxr
ding il 1970 the at JIS Clinton Ave.
III which a two-yciir-old girl was
'killed. iiti Alahny County (irand
.lury last week issued at report ac-
cusing the city of inadequate housing
inspection procedures.

SliNYA‘s Oil-Campus Associa-
tion said the report shows that
student-occupied housing in the city
of Albany is also inadequately in-
spected.

()CA President John Kennedy
said that. while the gi‘aiidjuryfocus-
ed its inVcstigation on buildings iii
the section of the city known as Ar-
bor Hill. its findings show that the
city “is probably not inspecting stu-
dent housing eitber.“ Kennedy siiid
the report shows that many
buildings “are not up to city code
standards."

Close to one-third of SUNYA‘s
undergraduate population lives off-
campus. according to ()CA es-
tit'ntttes.

/\ii)illly County District Attorney
Sol (ireenberg said the Grand Jury
report “basically miidc suggestions
III an effort to beef tip housing cudc
cnlorcciiicnt iii the city." Ilic report
did not ittcltidc indictments til city
officials or tile building liindlotd.

Among the grand jury's findings
were cliiii'gcs that:

0 There is housing that is not in
compliance with city codes. and has
not bccti inspected;

' There exists a continuing need
to "inspect housing oti a frequent
basis '

I The city does not hiivc enough
housing inspectors to maintain ac-
curate records: and

0 There existsa continuing need to
“inspect housing on a frequent
basis."

United Tenants of Albany Coor-
dinator Roger Markovics. who re-
quested that the DA‘s ofﬁce make an
inquiry ittto the Clinton Ave. fire.
said the grand jury report was too
long in coming‘down.

“We asked that criminal action be

 

taken against these people it ycitr-
and-ti-hiilt ago.“ Mlii‘iltWiCts said.
"but helGreenbcrg] was slow in
doing it. I didn't expect it would ever
reach the grand jury. though."

Markovics addcti that. though he
was disappointed iii the lack ol iti-
tlictincnts by the grand jury. lie was
pleased with its rccommendiitiotts.
“ 1 his isjust the tip oftlic iceberg." he
said. “This is the most tragic incident
of ii lack of code enforcement ever in
the city."

Ilc added that the major problem
with intiiiy buildings in the city is the
absence of a second exit.

Mtirkovics charged that Arthur
Phinney. the city‘s new code enforce-
mcnt director. has been inactive in
enforcing housing code violations.

llc laid the problem. in part. to
political patronage in the city of
Albany.

“Many people. such as inspectors.
are hired through the patronage
system. not by their abilities.“
Markovice said. “It's all part of the

likc body on the gradtiatc level. it is
impossible to meet this requirement.

Asa result. student representation
on it major university decision-
making body is reduced. Twenty
undergraduates are currently ser-
ving where 33 students might.

"(iraduate student representation
on this campus is lousy.“ Senate
Chair Donald Iiishko said.

Lisa (itircia. a graduate student
who unsuccessfully attempted to
fortii a grad Olgtllliltllimt earlier this
year. cited the tiiodcl under which
such a group would havcto organize
its prohibitive.

" l he model is too much like SA.“
she said. “(irad students ate simply
not its university oriented as un-
dergrads. They spend most of their
time working iii their respective
departments."

Dean of Graduate Studies Louis
Siilkcver agrees: “We're dcptirttncnt
oriented. mid that should be the
basis around which representation is
orgiini/cd. Right now. we can't do
that."

Senate secretary Kane said that
she doubted that any comprehensive
change in the seniitc election policy
would he initiated. leaving the crea-
tioti of II campus-wide graduate stu-
dctit body the only ulternativeforin—
creasing rcprcsenttttion.

Iiishko said that graduate
students. in addition to not to not be-
ing heard In the full senate body.
lacked "input in the senate councils
which deal directly with theta. such
as the Graduate Academic Council.“

Garcia. whose ill-fated attempt at
grad student organising met with
“considerable enthusiasm but little
action." calls for the administration
to take the intiative.

“The administration's attitude has
been that. since it's been tried so

miiny times and failed. it just won't
happen.“ she siiid. “We need aii ad-
ministrative representative corti—
mitted to the task."

Dean for Student Affairs Neil
Browa. said the administriition was
interested in getting graduate
students together. but pointed to the
lack of‘any kind ofunity among grad
students as the tnain obstacle.

“There just hasn't been an issue to
serve as a crystalizing agent which
would prompt the students to bitnd
together in opposition orsupport. as
the cttse may be." he said.

Brown further noted that many
grad students who as un-
dcrgriiduatcs were quite active in un-
iversity affairs -"just don‘t want to get
involved in politics again. Most are
too busy."

The prospects for organizing are
not all that remote. as evidenced by
the emergence and stability of the

Graduate Sttident Women's
Association.
