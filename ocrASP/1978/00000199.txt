Dear Traffic Division:
Enclosed is my check

News for three dollars. I'm

Focus graduating soon. and

would appreciate it if you
would remove the stop from my
files. because if I can't get my
transcripts I won’t be accepted
anywhere for ajob. I'll probably go
on welfare and soon turn to drugs.
So please don 't screw up.

This is a sampling of the sort of
mail that is received by SUNYA‘s
Trafﬁc Division every day. but with
greater frequency each semester at
this time. For those who have been
procrastinating the payment ot'their
parking tickets. the final hour has
arrived: preregistration.

in the past few weeks. the Depart-
ment of Public Safety has sent
notices to all SUNYA students.
faculty. and staff who have outsttt'n-
ding fines. Students learned that
they will not be able to register for
the upcoming semester until the ﬁnes
are paid. Graduating seniors. like the
one cited above. were informed that
their transcripts and diploma will be
held in limbo. Faculty and staff were
told that the unpaid amount will be
deducted from their paychecks.

The first few hundred dollars
received from these lines has un-
doubtedly gone toward paying a
large postage bill. for as oflast week.

4l07 holds were on record with the
Registrar‘s office.

“We try to give everyone enough
notice so that the tickets won‘t haunt
them at the last minute.” said Lynn
Atkinson of Traffic Control. “But it

seems that most people try to delay

the hour of reckoning for as long as
possible.“

As a result. paying for a trafﬁc
ticket at the last moment can be as
hectic as. for example, trying to get a
ticket to see the rock group Traffic at
the last instant.

“We‘ve tried to make the
procedure as painless as pessible.“
Atkinson said. “A hold can be lifted
as soon as the tickets are paid. To
combat the inevitable rush during
the last days of pro-registration. we
set up an assembly line to get people
in and out as fast as we can. While
one worker takes the ticket and the
money. another writes out a receipt
and a third writes up a release. The
student can bring the release form to
pie-registration and register im-
mediately.

Dear Traffic Division:

I am very puzzled by the notice I
received informing me that I owe
money for lllegall v parking at the an-
i varsity, for I have never even been in
Albany during my years on planet

Debatable situations like the one
above arise, obviously. and the
procedures used by SUNYA make
allowances for them.

“If appeal forms are filed within 72
hours.” Atkinson explained. “we'll
give the student a partial release."
Under a partial release, a student is
permitted to register. but is not able
to obtain a copy of his transcripts or

his diplomma until the appeal is

decided.

Students who have amassed huge
quantities of tickets can pay in in-
stallments. lfthc totalis between $50
- SIOO. a downpayment of half the
amount owed will enable you to
register. If you owe more than $l00.
at least $50 must be paid at once. If
your total is less than $50. under the
plan mandated by Director of Public
Safety Williams. you must pay the
entire sum before registering.

Relizing that their courses are be-
ing ﬁlled as they wait to pay their
tickets, the Trafﬁc Division becomes
an area ﬁlled with seething students.
The problems encountered from
faculty and staff non—payment.
though. is quite different.

“Their reactions are varied. Some
get very offended when we deduct it
from their checks. Others find it such
a simple means of payment that they
accumulate more tickets because of
it. Some seem to feel that subtracting

the amount from their pay is the way
it's always done. as if we i
plemented the system for their con—
veniencc!"

One faculty member admits that
during one pay period. the amount
he owed actually exceeded his ear-
nings. “I found a way to delay the
process. though.".he said. “If you
owe. say 560. send in a check for
$8.69. The computer can‘t handle
uneven amounts.

Death Penalty

continued from page three

personally commute all death
sentences to life imprisonment
should his veto be successfully
overridden. The governor‘s press
secretary said yesterday Carey has
not changed his position.

In response to Carey's promise,
Senator William Conklin (R-Queens
County) has sponsored legislation
which. as it currently stands. would
remove the governor‘s power to
commute death sentences. This
legislation. still in committee. would
probably also be veloed by Carey if it
were passed.

“All legislation passed by the
legislature must pass by the gover-
nor‘s desk." aspokesmanfor Carey‘s
press office said. “1 think it would be
fairly easy to guess what action the
governor would take on such legisla-
lion."

A lengthy legal struggle in the
courts could follow such develop-
ment. the spokesman said. especially
the legislature managed to overturn
a Carey veto of legislation removing
his power to commute.

Public sentiment on the issue, par-
ticularly since the recent shooting
deaths of two New York City
policemen. has largely been in favor
of the death penalty. Several
legislators. among them Senator
Joseph Tauriello (D-Buffalo), have
said they‘re supporting the death
penalty primarily to reﬂect the views
of their constituents.

The spokeswoman for Volker's of-
fice said legislators in both the
Senate and Assembly were receiving
mail on the issue. most ot'which urg-
ed the legislators to vote for an
merride.

"Pressure hasn't been brought to
bear before this." the spokeswoman
said. “The veto was anticipated all
along. This is the test. and people
have been responding in larger
volumes."
