:lf you sometimes‘ "think the com-
mercials on television are louder
than the programs they interrupt.
you're absolutely correct. .

The Federal Communications
Commission has released a study
supporting what many viewers have
complained about for a long time.

The FCC says that about half of
all the TV ads being broadcast are.
for one reason or another,
transmitted at higher decibels than
most TV programs. The Commis-
sion adds. however. that the
difference in volume levels is usually
not signiﬁcant.

 

OLFACTORY HABIT

Paris designer Yves St. Laurent
has a problem on his hands: He has
developed a new perfume that is sell-
ing wildly in Europe. but he can't
market the fragrance in the United
States.

The reason'.’ The new scent is
called "Opium." The Village Voice
reports that the people on Madison
Avenue are so sensitive about
puslting a perfume that has a drug-
oricntcd nante thttt the entire adver-

  
   

tising campaign to promote the
produce has been shelved in the US.

The advertisements for “Opium”
perfume in Europe follow the theme:
"For those who are addicted
to . .  The suggested ad blitz in
America was to ﬂash back and forth
between women using the perfume
and pictures of poppies. But this ap-
proach has been killed.

“Opium.” according to Adver-
tising Age. has been a smash success
in Europe.

STATE YOUR CLAIM

The insurance business is not quite
as dull as it may seem.

Take, for instance. these claims
filed with the Aetna Life and Casual-
ty insurance Company.

In one case. a man who was
tormented by mosquitoesin the mid-
dle of the night. sprang out of bed
and. unttble to stand it any longer.
sprayed the pests into oblivion.
When he awoke the next mornign.
he found that he had sprayed his
bedroom and clothing with red
enamel paint rather than with insec-
ticide. ilc asked Actna for compen—
sation for his graphic errors.

And then there is the claim ﬁled by
the gambler whos uys he stuffed his
winnings in his trousers after a
successful day at the race track. only
to watch his good luck go up in
smoke when he acctdcntttlly set his
pants afirc while lightinga cigarette.

And last. but not least. a rnortieiun

X — RATED

The movie "Saturday Night
Fever“ will be shown to a very
limited audience in England.

That's because the British rating
board has slapped the John Travolta
movie with a very restrictive “X-
rttting.“ The board reportedly found
that the cxpletives in the film which
were not deleted are simply too
numerous for an R-rating.

English distributors have
reportedly begged movie producer
Robert Stigwood to edit the
dialogue in “Saturday Night Fever.“
so that it can be shown to bigger
audiences. liut so fa r. Stigwood has
said no dice.

REMOTE CONTROL

Toy industy experts are predicting
that it won't be long before eight-
year-olds will be able to command a
whole regiment of toy soldiers by the
sound of their voices.

Kids. will also be able to give
mother- or father-like verbal instruc-
tions to their dolls. and watch them
respond.

This is all happening because in-
tegrated circuits and miniprocessors
are quickly becoming an impotant
factor in the toy industry.

Bill MacMullen, the Chief Ex-
ecutive in the United States of the
Concept 2000 Toy Company says
that these electronic break-lb roughs
mean that entire memory units can
be placed inside regular-sized toys.

MacMullen predicts taht not only
will toy dolls respond to theirowners
voices. but that toy-car roadruces
will be staged in which cars won‘t
need tracks. Each car will race along.
being accelerated and steered by its
owner‘s voice.

 

IN THE AIR

A Duke University Researcher is
reporting that Vitamin E may help
protect your lungs against the harm-
ful effects of smog.

Daniel Menul of the Duke
Medical Center in Durham says he
has found that mice displayed syrup-
toms of significant lung dsma’
when exposed to high levels of
“nitrogen dioxide." a common ele-
ment in smog.

Menzel says that he then fed a con-
trol group of mice regular doses of
Vitamin E and discovered that tlse
animals which consumed the
Vitamins did not experience the lung
damage.
