By CHIP GOLDBERG

y friend Mark and I had

bought our tickets a longtime

ago, and were very anxiously

awaiting the night of April I l,

which was when Pat Travers
and The Tubes were to play the Palace.
We had not, at ﬁrst, cared very much
about The Tubes, but when I heard that
they had an X-Ratcd show (which I soon
relayed to Mark) we decided to take a
6:35 Wellington bus. We didn‘t want to
miss a thing.

Taking this 6:35 Wellington bus
brought us to the Hotel Wellington at
7:00, which meant that we had about an
hour to kill before the concert. Mark was
hungry. so we stopped off at Neba‘s for
their 75-cent Hot Pastrumi special. As we
stit down to cat, I bccrimc acutely aware of
ii Voice behind me. I do not know very
much about music, (as you will soon see)
but i think that this was it step below
baritone. if there exists such it thing. It
sounded like crouking. The possessor of
this extra-ordinary set of chords was a
gentleman in his forties. wearing at large
army juckct rind ti bluc baseball cap. Hc
scented to be singing an old lrislt folk
bulltid that went, I believe. like this:
llucrn'l anybody know my Iris/i songs."
Goddanrmil,- doesn't anybody know?
Wassamarter, doesn't anybody
unneri'mn' English.” At least I think I 'm
speaking English. Ar least Irhr'nk I am...

Being ilili! lrislt. l was ntituritlly
touched by the old dtifier‘s song. and I
suggested to Mark that we get the hell out
of here. He agreed. and we quickly were
on our way.

Arriving at the Palace Theatre, I was
struck by many things (including a
vendor hlkalllg, "Speed and T, Speed
and l HC") not the least ofwhich was the
gcticriil appearance of tile crowd. Never
in my life had I seen so many scruffy
looking twcrps. I felt as though I had
\viiiidcrcd iittou Haiglti Ashhuryduy care
center. ll long hair tind denim juckets
\vct'c dctid. then these babes wcrc
rcsurrccting them; with 'd vengeance.
There was even a lioldovcr front pioneer
days. who litid u puck of Miti‘lhoi‘os rolled
up in the sleeve of his f-sliirt. and a pair of
mirror sunglasses. Mark lllld I felt like
preppies.

ltvo very little girls. who weren‘t old
enough to be somebody‘s daughters,
took ill] old puck ofSulcmsU think) from
the pocket of whut was obviously her
older brother‘s dcnimjuckct. It wusu very
old pack of Salcms. In fact, I didn't recall
seeing the Surgeon (icncrul‘s admonition
about the perils of smoking on it.
Anyway, from this \ct‘y old puck of
Siilcms lltcy extracted two very old, bent,
yclloti cigarettes. How anyone could
carry around butts like that, let iilonc
smoke them, was far beyond me, but I
siiid nothing. I think there might have
hecti u third smoke iii the pack. but the
littlcr (l) of the two very little girls tossed
the now crumpled package of Sulems
ovur lier shouldcr. saying, "Fuck the
prick. This will be enough.“

And it was. 1 don‘t know how they did
ll. but .it the end of the show. I saw those
same two little girls smoking their same
two little yellow cigarettes.

There was still some time before the
Palace (iuiirds would let us in. so, to help
it pass. we started Slill'ingill the clientele.

Mark‘s attention focused on a group of
youths. “Look ill the joint in that kid's
hand." he cxlciiimed. “it's as big as it
cigar." This is the some Mark who was
positive in twelfth grade that our
Psychology teacher wasn't wearing a

might have been every nice My in miny
respects. but as she was in her forties. not
wearing a bra wasn‘t one of them. Mark
pointed to the mammoth joint. It was a
cigarette.

This interjection annoyed me
somewhat, for at that time i was
otherwise occupied. A tall, dark kid with
braces and kinky hair was gesticulating
wildly (1 later found out this was his
normal manner of speaking). He was
engaged in conversation with a large girl
with ﬂowers in her hair. and who, when
struck by something she thought funny,
would laugh by chortling in a falsetto and
stick her chest in her companion’s face.

The tall skinny kid seemed to be known
by everyone there, except, of course,

 

From roam  2?

Mark and l. Hewas talking about how
one had to see Foghat live twoor three
times to really appreciate studio
albums. Then, in a loud voice, he
annouced that Grateful Dead tickets were
on sale tomorrow. And I. he continued,
have a friend at RPI! At this. Benny (I
think that was his name) was engulfed by
a swarming sea of prepubescent
Deadheads. I was dying to know more
about this guy. and luckily, I found him
speaking with another little girl. While
she was not as little as the other little girls,
she wasn't any bigger, either. She naked
him where he was from, and Benny spun
around. revealing a Columbia jacket. I
wondered if there was a Columbia High
School (or even a Junior High School) in

fourteen dollars to New London. Benny
then said who the fuck wants to go to
Connecticut when l have classes at mm
in the city. My mind reeled at the prospect
that this came up from Columbia
U niversity for every concert at the Palace.
Thankfully, the ushers let us in.

Finally, the first act came on. As lama
great Pat Travers fan, the short time he
played was heaven, I stood and I
screamed and I carried on like, like, well,
like most of the brats I had been looking
down my nose at for the past 45 minutes.
Well, Pat left without playingtbe mm

Tubes came on.

By DENNIS 8(3HEYER

am a Tubes person. I was one

before the Tubes concert at

the Palace last Tuesday

evening and I am even more

so now! The Tubes hail from
Los Aiigclcs and rumor has it that they
were thrown out of the city for being even
more vulgar and funny than Jiiyc P.
Morgan.

This has absolutely nothing to do with
lust 'l‘ucsdtiy‘s show. The opening act l’iit
lrztvcrs was tit bcst loud. His
introduction was ample warning: “Here
to kick your asses, Pat Traversl" The 75
per cent teenybopper audience lit up their
firecrackers rind prctcndcd Trtivcrs was
Kiss. Close enough!

His three piece “orchestra” as he called
it included l’ctcr Cowling and Nico
McBrriin. Travers is it credible guitarist
but his vocals were just plain awful!

Songs such as “Rock and Roll
Tonight." “Need Lovc“und “It Makes No
Difference" featured cliched riffs. and
were busciully noise.

After this. Travers said goodnight. but
the obviously tasteless younguns begged
for Lin encore. So, Put returned to do
“Stiiteboro Blues." Luckily it was ushorl
version.

After a long intermission, the lights
dimmed. First a warning; the Tubes in
concert are almost impossible to describe.

It helps to be there. For those of you who
weren't, here goes.

Thcy appeared oti the double-tiered
stage dressed in lab coats. Lcrid singer Fee
Wuybill asked the audience, “How many
of you brought your cassette recorders to
record the show“! How about videotape
machines?“ They proceeded to sing
“Show Me A Reason."

We were informed by band member
Sputnick Spooncr that Fcc would be
making a quick change. and then he would
do ii medley of Paul Anka and Sinatra
hits. The quick change took it while, so to
fill the gap ii bunch of people dressed in
space suits, complete with purusols. crime
lrumpolining on stage. We were told that
they were going todo some Albanian-Jup
songs. The choreography by the Ernest
Borgniiic dancers Would have made June
Taylor red with jealousy!

Finally He, the head spaceman. came
on stage. After some choreographed
fighting with poles. there was a flash of
light, and Fee was dressed a bit more
normally.

We were their told it volunteer would be
needed front the audience for "What Do
You Want From Life?" lthtid to belt “girl
with big tits!" While they set out to find
her, a color videotape consisting of
various shapes and colors flashed on the
back of the stage.

Once they found the appropriate girl

ALBANY ITUDIN'I‘ "III

they proceeded to bestow her with t i
endless amount of materialistic to 5
including cigarettes, albums, (which lhi y
also tossed into the audience), a Six
change. an apple, toothpaste (enough 0
last ll lifetime), a jet plane and best of al 1
Flying fuck—a—duck!

This was followed by a series of riddl 5
even too grotesque for printing here. Ne l.
thing we Were in a classroom, where Mi 8
Vanilla was teaching sex education. \
film was shown, and thc sensuoust se: y
Re Styles came out to accompany Fee (
“Don‘t Touch Me There‘." The lyrics
the song were accompanied by a li
demonstration between Re and Fee. 1’ l
during this a group of Shindig dance
boogicd their hearts out! “Mont
Bondage" came next. The line fro
“ Don‘t Touch Me There" which goes "1
smell of burning leather" w
demonstrated.

Then we heard “It‘s A Drag“ whe
several people were killed by gin
cigarettes. Next Fee came out dressed
Tom Jones and did a dynamite version
“It‘s Not Unusual." Aulf-défelseﬂlml
the women of the audience toﬂowe v.
They were told to use their nail files It 1
combs to scratch their attackers eyes at ..

Would you believe a rock and n ll
version of the theme from “Perry
Mason?" Then. there wu I bomb Ian!
