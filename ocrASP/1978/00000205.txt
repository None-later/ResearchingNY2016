“tan-ironic» Hits"
Ode JE 34967
Cerele King

n I959, Neil Sedaka had his
ﬁrst big hit with a love song he
wrote to his co-songwriter
Carole King. Carole wrote
many million-sellers with
Sedaka and others in the 60‘s. in the 70‘s
she sold millions singing her own songs.
'I'apestry, released in l970. still holds
the record for the longest running album
on the charts; something like 6 years. All
of her albums since “’I‘apestry“ have gone
gold.

Actually, Carole King's Greatest Hits
could be a three record set. not‘unlike Neil
Young's Decade. The purpose here was to
chronicle her top hits and that it does.
Because of this, there is a lot missing. But
for those of you who cannot afford the
entire Carole King collection. Greatest
Hits is adequate.

They‘re allhere. The inclusion of only
four songs from Tapestry isa mistake, but
“it‘s Too Late.“ “I Feel the Earth Move,"
“Smackwater Jack." and “So Far Away“
are great to listen to again.

Session men on the album include such
luminaries as Danny Kortchmar, Russ
Kunkel, James Taylor, Merry Clayton,
George Bohannon, Chuck Findley. Tom
Scott. Ralph McDonald. and more.
Other favorite songs. to name a few.
include; “Jazzman,” “Sweet Seasons.“
and her most recent hit(l975) “Only Love
is Real.“

For one thing. the release of this album
is two years too late. But. it‘s a worthwhile
one for all who have worn out copies of
her albums and can‘t afford to replace
them all. A new release would have been
better. but meanwhile check out Carole
King's Greatest Hits and wait for one!

ew people are really familiar

guitarist Pat Travers. This is a

it is into a music scene such as this that an

Travers almost totally dominates the

album. Besides providing lead vocals and
guitar, he also plays keyboards and co-

the album with Dennis

doesn‘t have the talent and know-how to
put together an album. then the album
will be a total disaster; (Le. Lou Reed‘s
Rock and Roll Heart.) Fortunately. this
is not the case with Pat Travers. His music
is the best new music I‘ve heard in along
time.

The album itself contains eight cuts
that exhibit a degree of rock energy rarely
captured on an album. From the opening
cut. “Life in London.“ the listener
becomes aware that Travers is not out to
fool around. but to get down to some
serious rock and roll.

Travers keeps up his continual display
of guitar wizardry with songs such as
"Speakeasy," and ‘ﬁRunnin‘ From the
Fulure."-Backed up by a band consisting
of Peter Cowling on bass. and Nicko
M cBrain on drums. he proves that not all
heavy metal music need be mindless.
There is even a completely instrumental

cut on the album which features Burt
licrmiston on sax. The cut is called “Off
Beat Ride." and the mere fact that
Travers has made excellent use of
saxophone in a rock and roll song proves
that he knows his business. for the album
is. indeed. an off beat ride.

counterpart remastering.

Every year hundreds of these so-called
anthologies hit the streets — often in
series like the RCA Legendary Performer
collection.
The Louis Armstrong anthology on
RCA is a rather nice collection. It
contains a well-rounded assortment of his
most popular material. most of which was
recorded in the thirties in Chicago and
other major US. cities. Because the
selections were taken from obscure 78

an eight page booklet on Armstrong‘s

the album is educational —- not only

also through a description of the men.
times. and ideas behind the mUsic. The
end product is a layman‘s Version of
“everything you ever wanted to know
about Louis Armstrong.“

And Louis Armstrong was indeed a
talent worth being familiar with. As an
innovator in swing and be-hop. he
brought many characteristics of New
Orleans jazz to the Chicago scene ofthe
thirties. In his prime. he was one of the
few performers of his era to take black
inner—city music out of the ghetto and
present it to a national. and eventually
international. audience. liven today his
name is practically synonymous with be—

And so despite poor recordingw

qualities. the musicstands up to repeated
enjoyable listenings. Such classic vocal
performances as “What a Wonderful
World“ and “St. James infirmary"
contain a musical emotionalisin which
has almost been devastated by modern
musrcal technology and theory. Likewise,
such swinging instrumentals as
Mahogany Hall Stomp" and “St. Louis
Blues“ have a toe-tapping ﬂavor that
would put all modern disco to shame.
What Armstrong lacked in technique was
morethan made up for in spirit. and it was
this musical charisma that became his
claim to fame.
loday Louis Armstrong is no longer
among the living. and while his death
doesn‘t beg for sympathy, his
contributions to ZOth century music
certainly demand respect through
recognition. And so. while anthologies
such as this often seem to be last-ditch
efforts on behalf of record companies to
rake in a few extra dollars with whatever
old recordings they happen to have lying
around the back room. from an
educational as well as aesthetic
perspective such recordings are valuable.
Not only do they reach out for a new
audience. they also contain a slice of
history. lhis collection stands as a
tangible record of a man‘s musical
contributions and achievements.
