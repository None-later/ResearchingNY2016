‘ to inform on one another, we have found this

method to be a successful one. If a team
notices on illegal player and doesn‘t care
enough to report to the AMlA Office in the
form of a protest, there is not much that we
can do about the matter. In no way do we wish
to maintain status quo as an organization, but
change just for appearances sake may be just
as bad.

Finally, and most importantly. Mr.
Seligson, as captain of his Leagur: IV
basketball team, Court Jesters, received from
AMIA as all captains do, a copy of a
document entitled “Duties of Intramural
Basketball Captains," which contains a
section called "Observe the Spirit as well as the
Letter of the Rules." All cxerpl from that
section reads: “While the code attempts by
rule and penalty to prohibit all forms of
unnecessary roughtness. unfair tactics and
unsportsmanlikc conduct, it is obviously
impossible to list every conceivable improper
or dishonorable act which can take place. it is.
therefore, the responsibility of players,
coaches. ofﬁcials and team supporters to
maintain the highest ethical standards.
Dclierately violating the rules in the hope or
expectation of not being penalized is
indefensible. No true sportsman will violate
any ofthe unwritten rules which exisl for the
good of the game.

lfa player cannotgain his/her objective or a
team cannot win a game cxccpt by tactics
which are unfair. then both the gain and the
victory are empty and reﬂect no credit on the
player or the learn.“

Therefore, AMIA does not condone the use
ofillegal players in any sport. but until a more
effective and less time-consuming method for
discovering their presence in games can be
elucidated, we have to keep things the way
they are and continue to show our faith in the
integrity and honesty of learn captains and
participants.

To the Editor:

With this year's annual l’honothon rapidly
approaching, we are once again in need of
volunteers lo help solicit contributions for the

v Annual Fund. Needless to say, the university

ll lifting through a most crucial period, and
funds are desperately needed to reinforce
activities handicapped by budch cuts. Money
raised during-the Phonolhon is used for

university services. 1

Last year the Phonothon was able to raise
over $35,000 through the combined efforts of
faculty, students and alumni. With continued
support from these areas this year‘s fund drive
can be equally successful.

The Phonolhon will take place from April
l7 - April 20, and April - April 27 at the
Alumni House. Volunteers are provided with
a free buffet dinner each evening, and are then
instructed on calling alumni and friends ofthc
university, soliciting for donations.

The money raised by Phonothon beneﬁts
each student and faculty member: Pleasejoin
us in making this year's l’honolhon a success.

response

To lhe Editor:

Rcccnlly, 1 read a rather absurd article in
the Albany Student Press. The article, written
by a local “disc-jockey." Dennis Schcyer.
makes a few very good observations, but
leaves out so many more that I‘m rather
surprised the .4 SP1: editors let it slip through
lhcir fingers.

Dennis. who must spend hours reading pop
music journals (to have read all of them)
implies that music of lhc scvcnticsjusl isn‘t up
lo par when compared to the sixties. He then
lakes us on a rather hiascd tour through his
very own record collection. It was hardly
necessary to tell us it's your collcclion. Dennis,
we could tell.

Let‘s take a look at the decade‘s music lo
date and sec what was left oul. Before Boston,
liud Company seemed to gel misplaccd. And

,whal about Chicago, Cﬂisby, Sﬁlls und,Nash,.
Charlie Daniels, The Doubles, ELP,und ELO
before whnl was his nuinc‘l. Fogclbcrg. And
lbcn lhcrc‘s Billy Joel. Billy Joel. Just a Long
Island bond, Dennis? I think that rules as an
insult. Speaking of insults. you also seemed to
forget Gabriel. Ucncssis, and that San
Francisco band, you remember, Jefferson

Slurship. Red Octopus was the album ofthc year
in 1976, wasn't it‘.’

Moving right along. I think perhaps
surviving members of Lynyrd Skynyrd should
be advised of lhcir rights. 'lhcy have been
"blatantly" hurrasscd.

lhc gilp from l. to Meatloaf wasn‘t loo had",
Loggins und Mcssinu, Maison. Miller, and
Morrison were just ll few of lhc forgotten
hcrocs.

Just to the right, Pink Floyd, Alan Parson‘s
l’rojccl, Renaissance. James Taylor. and
Jethro Tull were passed by along with Wings,
Yes and Zappa. Worthy of special mention is
Slavic Wonder. whose Songs in the Key of
Life was last year‘s album of the year.

Let‘s face it, Dennis, if you were too y0ung
lor the Beatles, Dylan, and lhc Stones, maybe
you should mm in your mike and headphones,
or maybe your problem Is pcrccpluul. Look
around mun. Dylan and the Stones both gave
us new material and I dare you to listcnlo any
progressrvc FM sluliun for more lhunun hour
and not hear :1 Single Bcullc cul.

The scvcnlics offch us the choice and
vuriuly lhc sixties l'cll shorl on. I hardly think
that the sixties and the seventies can be
grouped scpurnlely. We couldn‘t have one
wilhout the other.

My point is that there are probably no
performers bad enough to be left out, and
none good enough to be singch out, so 1 have
provided you with u parllul list of the 1970's
rock to date. I'm sure anyone reading lhis can
add another lwcnly cnirics of the list. My
suggestion ls, add them, and add the greats
that Dennis mentioned, and save it so you can
show your kids whal the seventies really
consisted of. I‘m sure that lhcy will provide
you with a rather complete survey through
I978; but Dennis, “God forbid" we leave
anyone out.

Students onSenate  

Students hav'e'absolutely no right to be members of a faculty union.
The decisions of 'such a union affect the faculty and only the faculty -—-
and the students have no business being in on those decisions.

By the same token, faculty members have no right to be on Central
Council. Central Council doles out the student tax dollars to clubs and
activities. The money it uses is student money, the projects it supports
are student projects, and faculty members should not be involved in
those matters.

However, the University Senate is the system of governance at
SUN YA which helps develop policy that affects all of the factions here.
Decisions of the Senate are sent to the S UN YA President, and if they are
approved, they become university policy. .

Faculty members work here, and they deserve to have representation
on the University Senate. Student's go to classes and live here, and they
too have the right to be represented on the body which initiates policies
which directly affect them. That’s only logical.

Presently, students comprise one-third of the University Senate. On
May 8th, faculty members will meet in the Campus Center Ballroom to
decide whether students will be able to be a part of the Senate for the
next twa years. Ever since students were allowed onto Senate in I969,
there has been sentiment on the part of many faculty members that they
don‘t belong there.

Hence, in the “Off years", when faculty isn’t voting on student
representation, students attempt to gain permanent status, and in the
voting years, they simply attempt to remain on Senate.

The faculty resistance stems largely from the feeling that Senate
represents the only viable forum for faculty. It is a nice idea for the
faculty to have their forum at SUN YA, but when that forum is a major
planner of university policy, it is essentialto have student participation.

Faculty members should come to grip with the fact that the only fair
and just thing is to retain student representation. it is also the only way
the Senate can retain its integrity as a truly representative policy-
developing body.. I . r I
