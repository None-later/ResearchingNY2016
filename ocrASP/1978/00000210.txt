Wednesday's Albany State-
Cortland State lacrosse'ganie is one
the Danes will try to forget, but
probably never will.

Albany went into the game against
the eighth-ranked team in the state
its the heavy underdog And that
may be an understatement.

When the final whistle sounded.
the result was close to what was ex-
pected. The final score was 28—0.

“it was the longest game of my
life.“ said a somewhat relieved
Albany head coach Mike Motta.
“Just unbelievable." _

The long afternoon started very
quickly. at least for the 3-! Red
Dragons. Theyscorcd live ofthe first
six times they had the hall in the
Albany end. And that was only after
five minutes of play.

Keeping the hall in Albany‘s end
was part of the Danes‘ game plan.
only Cortland revised it it little. "We
wanted to stall as much as we could."
sand Motto. “Our plan was to keep
the ball in our end its much as possi-
ble and not lilkt.‘ tiny shots tintil we
had the chance."

By halftime, the Dragons ptit half
of their 26 shots into the net. In con-
trast. the Danes mustered only five
first half shots and goalie Joe Lare
easily stopped all of them.

No Upset

if the Danes had any dreams of
upsetting Cortland when they came
out for the second half. they were
soon turned into nightmares.

Cortland continued their persis-
tcnt attack and pumped in another
five goals in the third period. With
only 15 minutes left to play, the
Danes saw themselves trailing 18-0.

Albany managed to hold the score
through most of the ﬁnal period ex-
cept for the last few minutes when
Cortland scored most of their final
ten goals.

Bill Dufford led Cortlandin scor-
ing with three goals and seven
assists. Bill Dufford was the lending
goiil scorer with six and he assisted
on three others. Mark Kuetner and
lloh Lcyden also had three goals for

the winners.

But one hip-reason for the

; different level of competition. ‘Vl‘hey ‘
play a different brand of lacrosse,”
said Motto. Their only lost of the
season came to the best team in'the
nation. Cornell. The Red Dragons
also will play the Division 11 team in
the nation. Hobart.

To Motta though. it was just
another loss and he doesn‘t think it
will affect the team. “They're (the
team's) attitude is pretty good. They
were always hustling out there."

Future Improvement

The game may have even helped
the team. “We saw some things we
might use in the future," said Motta.
“But the big difference was the
stickwork. Their guys have eight to
ten years experience while most of
our guys have only it few.“ concluded
Motta.

The Danes try again tomorrow to
earn their ﬁrst win of the season.

Losing the 440 medley relay was
