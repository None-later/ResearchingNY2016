A broken faucet spewed water

section of carpet in the second floor
Fireside Lounge.

The break occurred shortly after |
PM. when workers moving a
portable stage unit through a foyer
at one end of the Fireside Lounge
dropped the unit against a wall
faucet. shearing it off.

Water gushed from a two and one-
lialf inch cold water pipe for
approximately 45 minutes. until
Kenneth Martin of the SUNYA
Plant Department located the valve
which serves that section of the
building. Martin had been called in
from his home in Troy.

The break. located just above the
stairs linking the Off-Campus
Lounge with the Fireside Lounge.

and on the stairway steps, damaged
ceiling tiles and the stained beams in

Water which leaked through the
floor of the Off-Campus Lounge
entered the Campus Center kitchen.
causing the Snack Bar to move
operations into the Dell Shop

"It pushed the guy over. Hundreds
of gallons of water were coming
out." he said “When I was on
submarine duty I never saw so much
water."

Acting Campus Center Director
James Doellefeld said he couldn't
estimate the cost of the damages.
Water vacuums were used on the
floor of the Off-Campus Lounge, he
said. and the carpeting in that area
may not need to be replaced.

Richard (iillmun. a member of the committee. said that the decision
to study the itiotto was made because “the motto is not ambitious

The possibilities for change are unlimited. he said. If the committee
does find the motto to he sexist. it could be changed to “Let each

SUNYA Budget Includes Surplus

by MJ. Mentmott

Excess savings in salaries and
wages of approximately 5600.000
Were realized by SUNYA during
l977-78. according to SUNYA
Budget Officer Harold C. Brink.
Those savings were over and above
the 5800.000 which the Division of
Budget mandated that SUNYA save
ltist year. and according to Brink. cf-
l'orts to make use of these savings
have failed.

"During l977-78. this campus
generated more savings than re-
quired because the I)()Ii had im-
posed a freeze on hiring." said Brink,
“At that time we were carrying about
l50 vacant [faculty] lines. The freeze

wasn‘t lifted until last summer.
otherwise the excess savings would
have been more."

The lifting of the freeze allowed
SUNYA to make use ofsome ofthe
funds by starting to fill vacant
positions.

Members of the University
Senate's Resource Allocation Com-
mittee were informed of the poten-
tial savings by Brink on November
29. I977. The RAC is made up of
faculty. administration. and student
representatives. According to one of
the committee members. Sociology
Professor Ntin Lin. the committee is
“charged with a consulting role on
allocating this university‘s resources.

Unionization Movement Becomes Student Union

have a student utiioii when the Stit-
deiit lliiioiii/tition Movctnent
rttlilicd a constitution Mar. 2‘) iind
became the Albany Slti-
deitt Utiioti.

the chair of the SUM
organization said that the
constitution was ratified
by a majority vote of the ap-
proximately 30 students who attend-
ed the meeting The tnceting was
open to fill SUNYA students.

SU M organizer Bruce Cronin said
he liopeti the union will grow to at
least ten per centofthe student body.
or about I200 members.

Cronin added there will be no
mass membership drive this semester
to recruit members to the union.
although next semester there will be.
Many students may not join the an-
ion until un issue arises which affects
them directly. he said.

Originally. Cronin laid. them

ion's small membership. and the few
remaining weeks in the semester.

dian Quads. will be set up.

Cronin said there tire currently
l50 students who are members of
the union.

SUM chair'lito Martinez said the
phased-out organization he headed
tip was ttieutit to educate people
about Wllill it student union is iind
why students cottid use otic.

“We had to get prepared iitid get
the support of the student body
before we could forth the actual
structure of a student union.“ he
said.

He sitid the union has been un-
visioned llti a grass-roots political
pressure group attd tilt organization

the main goal of the union will be to
better the life of SUNYA students.
One of itit goals will be to achieve
collective bargaining rights with the
SUNYA administration. over such
issues as housing coiitracti.

Martinc/ said lliere is It need for it
union because the only other
organization which represents the
student body on campus. the Stu-
dent Associution. derives a large
portion of its legitimacy frotn the
SU NYA administration.

SA has to work uttder the
guidelines of SUNYA because
SUN YA collects tax money which is
used to fund SA. Every check tnude
out by SA must be reviewed iitid eti-
dot‘scd by SUNYA. he said.

Wiird added. “the student tttiioii
will derive its legitimacy from
students atid not the university."

Both Ward and Martinez are run-
ning for President of SA.

Martinez said lie doesn‘t feel he is

to be it member of the union even if
he won‘t be an active leader. Ile udd-
ed that SA has an advantage of being

Ward said that part of her reason
for running for preildent is to help
the union to get on ltr feet. by one

snring that SA doesn‘t work against
it.

The union's first activity.

t'llll aid difficulties students have.

The union's only financial backing
at this point comes from proceeds

Rocky ilorror Picture Show." The
$350 raised III that event will carry

year. Cronin said.

Funding for next year hasn't been
located. although Martinez said at
one poiiil the union was considering
asking SA for about 53000. He
called that option ti ltnttalterntttive.

The union may charge members

raising activities. Martinez said.

not a decision-making one.”

At the November meeting. Brink
presented a plan for using 3500.000
of the excess savings. SUNYA re-
quested DOB approval to use the
money in such areas as equipment
and temporary services. according to
Brink. That request was denied by
the DOB. because of what Brink
culls “bad timing."

“It Bot caught in a general budget
cut even though SUNY Central had
received it well." said Brink. The
$600,000 hits since gone back to the
state.

“I think it‘s kind of inefficient that
we lose all the moeny we're saving."
said a former student member ofthe
RAC, Brian Sands. “The ways in
which we httve to spend money here
at SUNYA are so speciﬁc it‘s incredi-
ble. There should be some way of
giving us more freedom with what
we can do with the lines."

“My own feeling,“ said Lin. is
that we probably wouldn‘t have
gotten it back anyhow. It was the
kind of money the state expected to
get back in the first place. A job
freeze is one ofthe ways they use to
balance the budget."

About 60 positions now remain
open. The excess savings could not
have been used to create new
positions or to rehire retrenehcd
faculty. since they dealt only with
“existing vacant positions." accor-
ding to Brink.
