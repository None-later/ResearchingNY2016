A NYPIRG survey conducted last -. ,

W‘MW ,

 About 370 empty soda cans were
mailed to Governor Hugh Carey‘s

' office last week as part of a lobbying
effort aimed at gaining passage of
legislation designed to reduce street
litter and save on energy use.

The legislation. which would place
a 5c deposit on all beverages sold in
bottles and cans. is pending before
the New York State Legislature.
Carey has promised to veto the bill
should the legislature pass it.

Cans were collected at a table set
up in the campus center last week by
members of NYPIRG, which funded
the mailings. Students were asked to
deposit empty beverage cans in box-
es which were later mailed to Carey's
ofﬁce. _

The action was modeled after a
similar campaign which sent cans
and bottles to President Carter
earlier this year. NYPIRG Vice

Chair Steve Co . lon said about 500,-.

 

PAC! FOUR

000 caps reached Carter in

Washington as a result of that cam-
paign. Mailing the cans to Carey is
seen as a means of inﬂuencing
legislators who have yet to make up
their minds about the bill. Coplon
said. '
“ he leaders of the Assembly are
waiting for Carey‘s OK, because
without that. the bill really isn't go-
ing to get anywhere.“ Coplon said. If
Carey were to change his stance on
the legislation, it might stand a better
chance of passage. he said.
Bill Should Pass Senate

“The legislation isdel'mitely going
to pass the senate." he added. Senate
Majority Leader Warren Anderson
has indicated that he is in support of
the bill. he said.

A similar bill was recently passed
in Connecticut by the state
legislature. Connecticut Governor
Ella Grasso has indicated that she
will sign that bill into law.

year indicated that litter could be
reduced by as much as 66 per cent if
such legislation we're passed in New
York State. The’state currently
spends about ten million dollars an-
nually cleaning up litter, according
to Coplon. ‘

Bottle and can deposit legislation
has been passed and signed into law
in Vermont. Customers there pay an
additional ﬁve cents per can or hot-
tle. and are reimbursed when the
containers are returned.

NYPIRG maintains that such
deposits will result in savings in
energy and natural resources. as
bottles and cans are recycled.
Coplon said he thought the project

was a unique way of reaching the‘

governor. “At this point. we think we
should try anything within reason to
influence Carey's opinion.“ he said.
The legislature is expected to vote on
the bill before the end of the session.

I was coming out ofthe subway at
79th and Broadway. I heard
someone say. “Lady, nicah.“ Below
me on the steps wasa little black boy.
“You want to buy a nicah bag. lady?“
Did I want a nickle bag of grass? He
meets me midway on the steps. pull-
ing out a little manila envelope from
his beige shoulder bag. "Five
dollars.“ he smiled. One tooth was
missing in his lopsided grin. One lace
was unticd on the Pony sneakers that
had JACKIE written across the
yellow tips in red Magic Marker.

“Do you want this?" he pushed the
envelope at me.

No. I said. Do you want some
lunch‘.’ We walked to the Burger
King on 82nd Street. I ordered a
coffee; he ordered a Whopper. coffee
and apple pic. I took out money but
he pushed my hand away. He'd pay.
A roll of thick bills came out of his
pocket. Sixty or 70 dollars. But he
didn't pay with the bills. He counted
out two dollars in change. smiling at

He lived in the Bronx on Eagle
Avenue. he said. With his grand-

mother in a nice. nice place. “You '
know. with trees, I have a dog. Not a .

biting one. This one smiles with nice
teeth." . '

“What‘s your dog‘s name?" I
asked. He didn't answer.

“Well. I don't have a dog now. but
where I used to live they had a man-
eating dog. The cops had tocome get
him because his teeth were so big he
could eat the whole town and he still
would be hungry. Itold those cops to
hypnotize him and they tried to. but
his devil eyes got big and red and he
hypnotized them instead. And they
started barking like real dogs. And if
you don't believe me. just ask Marty.
He saw it. We both did."

I would like to meet his grand-
mother and see his house. Will he
take me‘.’ We could go tomorrow.

Well. no. he said. Because his
grandmother might not be home.
She has burns on her legs and her
hands are all knotted up. but. il‘ i
like. we can have coffee near his
house. I can meet him on
Westchcster Avenue near the Father
and Brother Grocery.

“My grandmother gave me some
money to go to the store. But I
wanted to take a trip so I got on the
train. There weren‘t no trees where
this train went. Only tunnels and
black holes. So I just had some
coffee and a pretzel where the train
building is. And when I got home my
house was burned black and my
grandmother was gone.“

had tears in his eyes;

“Old man‘s cat died.” he looked at
me. “Got a cigarette?“

We walked down Westchcster
Avenue past a barber shop with a
copy of the Last News taped to the
window. CHRIST IS‘COMING AS
A THIEF IN THE NIGHT.

The New York Central Railroad
used to have a station at Hegney
Place. Now a burned-out shell
stands where commuters used to sit.
Junkies pee in here. Two men stood
in the doorway. holding a can of
Sterno.

Jacke said he lived at 632 Eagle
Avenue. Six-thirtyvtwo Eagle
Avenue is a pile of rubble. You can‘t
live here. I said. Around us the
houses are reduced to doors standing
with no walls, windows with no
glass, floors carpeted in a foot of
beer cans and bottles.

Across the street from 632 Eagle
Avenue is the Segunda Iglcsia
Christiana. Pastor Felix Ramirez's
wife walked across the street to talk
with me. No. Jackie couldn‘t have
lived here. These houses have been
burned and deserted for about four
years. Why don't I tell someone to
come and ﬁx the buildings? “Write
that." she said to me in Spanish.
“You tell them to come ﬁx this
place." She walked with us to the
Friendly Food Center. now locked
up with heavy green metal shutters.
Just a few weeks ago two boys from
Central America were killed in front
of the food center. Her hand became
a jerking piston. She aimed at me.
“Bang. Band." she said. “They just
shoot them boys. Bang. Bang."

Jackie and I walked to a small
bodca. He boughtaba ofS '

peanuts. He tugpd at my arm and in

a very quiet voice told use that he.

No. he really. lived .on St. Ann's .

Jackie and I meet at the Burger
King. He said‘that he didn‘t think I
was going to come. Why, I asked
him? Did he think I was angry
because he lied to me about his
grandmother? He looked at me and
smiled. His grandmother lives in the
country. he said. Now. he lives with a
man. Who? He won't say. Does he
live with the person who gives him
the grass to sell?

“You think you‘re smart." he
laughed at me. Well. he told me.

alone. Five other guys doused an old
man with gasoline and then lit him
up. Did you burn him todeath. lask-
ed. No. not quite. But he lit out likea
bat out of hell. I told him that I saw
this show on television. He didn't
really do it.

“No. not really. But we tossed
some lighting stuff on him. Well. not
real lighting stuff. We didn‘t burn
him. We just tossed a match on his
coat. It didn't start a fire. but it could
have.“

Jackie paid for our coffee and we
walked along Broadway. He pointed
out the people he thought were

h junkies. A well-dressed old woman

She's a terrible. junkie. Jackiesald
Didn‘t I see‘hcr shake? She a
junkie for sure. Jackie doesn't like
junkies. _ I
“I once had a horse when I lived
where it‘s green and this horse used
to ridc‘me in the streets where the
buildings are near trees. But then the
hop-headi said they wanted to ride
and I wouldn’t let them because they
were nodding and drooling and my

. horse didn't like that. So Itold them

don't do no more skin-popping and
my horse might like you and I would
let you ride. But hop-heads like their
dreams. They like to drool. So they
didn‘t get a ride that day."

Today [called Special Services’for
Children and the Children's Aid
Society. What do you do. I asked
them. if you know a seven-year-old
boy who sells marijuana and doesn't
go to school and who lived with
someone you don‘t know in a place
you can't find? Do I have a birth cer-
tificate. they asked me. Am I the
legal guardian? Does be live with
me? is he a person in need of super~
vision?

I told them how I met him at the
subway stop on 79th Street. He sells
grass. He told me that he lived with
his grandmother. but I went with

' him to the southeast Bronx and we

didn't find her and the houses he
remembered were gone. He‘s very
neat and clean. I said. he told me he
never went to school. yet he can read
and he speaks very well. He‘s smart.
He carries money and he can make
change and travel the subways alone.
