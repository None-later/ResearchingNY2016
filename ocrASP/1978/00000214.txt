If you think you’re under a lot of '

pressure, listen to this? scientists at
Carnegie Institute in Washington,
D.C. report they have used a device
called a “diamond anvil“ to produce
the highest pressure ever recorded.

They say they were able to create a
pressure of 25.2 million pounds per
square inch. described as being 700
times that exerted on the earth‘s
crust by the world's tallest peak,
Mount Everest. The scientists report
that the intense pressure caused part
of a diamond to “flow likeplaslic.“ a
phenomen no one had everobserved
before.

HIGH ART

The Journal of the American
Medical Association is reporting
that many of the early American ln-
diau rock paintings were apparently
drawn under the influence ol'a “jim-
sonweed high."

New York Pathologist Klaus
Wellman. writing in this week's
AMA Journal. says that the dream-
like sense of the supernatural.

depicted in paintings discovered in
Texas and the West Coast. indicate
the painters were stoned on jim-
sonweed extracts.

Liquid extracts of the weed. in
mild doses. 7 can produce visions.
Doctor Wellman writes. In heavier
doses, he adds. the same weed can in-
duce coma and death.

EYE SEE YOU

Newly-released government
documents reveal that the CIA used
undercover campus informants and
local police contacts to spy on cam-
pus activists during the late I960‘s
and early 70's.

According to the documents. ob-
tained and released by the
Washington-based "Committee To
Stop Government Spying," the
CIA’s campus spying program was
code-named “project resistance.“

The documents indicate the the
project put heavy emphasis on
gathering underground and new-left
publications on campuses and
tunneling them back to head—
quarters. “l’roject Resistance“ is also
reported to have used informants to
detect any signs ofpossible threats to
CIA recruiters visiting campuses.

The Committee To Stop Govern-
ment Spying says the memos it has
obtained under the Freedom of In-
formation Act reveal that “Project

Resistance” was. in the committee‘s
words, “a major CIA domestic sur-
veilanee program.”

One purpose of the project. accor-
ding to a memo, was to determine
“indications of the effectiveness of
the militants, and their ability to
mobilize students of only passive or
curiosity-seeking interest.” The
program was apparently launched
after CIA ofﬁcials became alarmed
over the effectiveness of anti-war
groups in organizing mass
demonstrations.

According to other memos. the
spying program produced contacts
between CIA ﬁeld ofﬁces and cam-
pus security ofﬁcials, state and local
police. the FBI. the Air Force, the
Army and the Navy. all of whom
reportedly gathered information on
campus activists.

The CIA is said to have curtailed
“Project Resistance" in December of
I970. But an agency review of the
program in I975 noted. that he pro~
jcct “developed new informants and
came up with information that
would indicate they (the informants)
attended some of the dissident
meetings."

THE BEAT GOES ON

The Federal Communications
Commission is claiming to have
solved the mystery about a strange
and powerful radio pulse said to be
adversely affecting the health and
behavior of humans in the Eugene.
Oregon. area.

The FCC. in a frief statement
issued in Washington. says that the
mysterious radio signals are
originating from a naval installation
in Dixon. California. several hun-
dred miles south of Eugene.

At least 25 residents in the Eugene
area have been complaining about a
strange ringing in the cars. throat
problems. reddening of the skin.
headaches and insomnia. University
of Oregon Industrial Hygienist
Marshall Van Ert alleges; there is a
direct connection between the
physical symptoms and the powerful

sigrial that pulses about “00 times
per second.

.The FCC claims it is totally un-
concerned, however. The Federal
agency says there is nothing
“mysterious” about the pulses, and
insists that theylare no more harmful
than standard AM or FM radio
waves. The FCC says the radio
signals should be causing no harm to
anyone.

WITCH HUNT

The American Civil Liberties Un-
ion is charging that the Air Force
used “witch hunt” tactics to identify
and then dismiss a number of civilian
workers who had occasionally
smoked marijuana away from the
job.

A total of 48 employees at the
Buckley Air National guard base in
Colorado were abruptly ﬁred last
f all after they reportedly admitted to
using marijuana on a few occasions
while away from the base.

The New York Times reports that
the Air Force‘s office of special in—
vestigations used a phony story that
a major security leak had occurred in
order to identify and fire the casual
pot users.

According to The .T'ImCS.
employees were taken aside and urg-
ed by investigators to report any pot-
smoking they had engaged in so that
they could not later be blackmailed
by foreign agents. The Times says
that when several workers. worried
about security breaches. admitted to
smoking weed maybe four or live

Testimony in hearing before the
Senate Health Subcommittee in-
dicate that a number of doctors hired
by US drug companies to test drugs
for the (prescription market have
committed fraud and other serious
abuses in approving these drugs.

“Food and Drug Administration
Commissioner 'Donald Kennedy

. ,told the Subcommittee tnst FDA

investigators made 26 inspections of
physicians who were testing drug
for such companies as Bristol
Meyers, Hoffman La Roche. and the
McNeil Laboratories. .

One physician reportedly was paid
$106,000 for “testing”I a drug that
Bristol Laboratories hoped would
reduce the symptoms of s'enility.

The test site was a nursing home,
somewhere in Florida. which was
characterized by FDA ofﬁcials who
later tracked it down as “a rat-
infestcd dump."

As it turned out. the administrator
of the home had been indicted for
embezzling funds from patients, and
the physician who was paid by
Bristol Meyers had disappearethe
medical license found among his
effects, however, was forged.

According to testimony from
Bristol Research Chief Stanley
Crooke. the phoney physicians'
credentials had seemed to be "ideal."

Kennedy told the Senate Subcom-
mittee that other abuses included
reporting to the companies on
patients who didn't exist. had never
gotten the experimental drug. never
given their informed consent to be—
ing tested or didn't even have the dis-
ease the drug was supposed to treat.
