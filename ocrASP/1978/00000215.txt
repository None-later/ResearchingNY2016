By AL BACA

ithin the past few years

there has been a rising trend

in the number of bands

originating in Long Island

and gaining national
prominence. Blue Oyster Cult and Billy
Joel are just two examples of Island
artists who have gained national
notoriety. The Good Rats is another
Long Island band striving to make it big
with a national following. As part oftheir
method for taking their music to places
which are not "Rat Cults," they played a
one night gig at the Hullabaloo on
Sunday night.

Inaway itwas notsurprisingtosee that
there were a lot of Rats fans in the
audience that night, given the number of
Islanders who go to school in the Albany
area. It was not the Rails intention,
however, to play to their die hard fans.
They wanted to capture the appeals of
those people who were not familiar with
their music, and they succeeded in doing
this to an unimaginable extent.

a Island’s as. 

From Rats to Riches, the band went on to
perform such popular numbers as "Does
it Make You Feel Good?" and "Injun
Joe.” Of course, the Rats fans in the
audience went wild, but what was really
surprising to see was that everyone else
was getting into the music as much as the
diehard fans. This was probably due in
part to the very personal stage presence of
the band and also to the use of all the
“Rat” paraphanalia used by lead vocalist
Peppi Marchello. This included the
traditional wooden baseball but which
Peppi played as a guitar, a garbage can
filled with rubber rats which were thrown
out into the audience. and a wooden toy
guitar which Peppi played during the
second set. The band is sued to being on
an extremely personal basis with the
audience, so when the audience reacts
favorably to their songs, they play better
and longer. This was the case on Sunday
night.

From the beginning of the night, it was
obvious that Peppi wnated to start a one-
to-one relationship with members of the
audience. He took requests lromthe fans,
and also raised the volume of the sound

system' when someone complained that it
was too low. Playing a mixture of songs
from their new album and their previous
two albums, the Rats continued to' build
up an aura of energetic excitement in the
audience that no one ever expected.

Peppi introduced members of the band
during the song “Coo Coo Coo Blues."
Drummer Joe Franco received a big
round of applause when it was announced
that he was from Albany. Guitarist John
Gatto, bassist Lenny Kotke, and lead
guitarist Mickey Marchello were equally
well received even though they were from
Long Island.

After the introductions were over. the
Rats ﬁnished off the first set with a few
songs from their new album. It was at this
time that Peppi brought out his garbage
can ﬁlled with rubber rats. He began
throwing them out to ecstatic members of
the audience. The black rats became
cherished possessions of those lucky
enough to catch them as they went sailing
through the rafters of the club.

After a break of about 45 minutes. the
Rats came back onstage to rejuvinate the
exoitement created during the ﬁrst set.

The band showed their versatility on such"
songs as “Dear Sir," and “Victory in
Space,” both from the new album. Peppi
Marchello demonstrated his vocal talent
on “Fireball Express." and “Yellow
Flower."

What made the evening even more
enjoyable was the fact that the members
of the band seemed to be havingas good a
time as the audience. At one point in the
show, Peppi picked up John Gatto and
put him on his shoulders. Gatto
continued playing: guitar for a few
minutes on top Peppi's shoulders while
Peppi went strutting around the stage.

By the end of the second set, the
audience was still waiting to hear more of g
the Rats, so the band was cheered on for
an encore. As most people know, bands
usually plan to come out for at least one
encore, so no one was really surprised
when the Rats came right back on stage to
play a couple more songs. What was
surprising though, was when the Rats left
the stage after their encore. What
happened to the audience at this point is
hard to explain. It was obvious that the
Rats did not plan on coming out again,
but the place went wild all the same. At
first, people were merely yelling and v
applauding for more music. This built up ‘
to people banging beer bottles and glasses
on the tables. The Rats still weren't '
coming out, so people began to bang -
tables and chairs on the floors. It got to
the point where it seemed as if the roof .
was about to collapse. Then some I
authority-type person came out to say ‘
that there would be no more music. This

was obviously the wrong thing to say _‘
A "since_the{people=4Went even-more crazy: ' ‘

It Was at this time. when the 'n'oiSe level "
in the club resembled that ofanSST, that
the Rats came out fora second encore. By
the crowd‘s reaction, one would have
thought that Jimi Hendrix had been risen
from the dead, but the Rats took it all in
stride and went on to play another two
songs, finishing up the evening with
“Boardwalk Slasher." and a frenzied
handshake session. The band captured
the musical hearts ol'everyone in the club
that night. and to witness it was an
experience one will never forget, for it's
really great to follow a band from their
beginnings and see them finally reach the
start of stardom. If the Rats get this type
of reaction when they tour in other states,
and if they get enough airplay on the
airwaves, then it probably won‘t be too
long before we see another Long Island
band hit the nationwide charts.
