Loses 1b Oneonta 1h Snow

by Bruce Shelnhaus

Maybe it‘s time that someone
realise we are still in the winter and
spring is only here on the calender.
The Albany State Women's Softball
team realized this on Saturday when
they attempted to play a game at
Oneonta.

In between play stoppages.
because the snow was coming down
too hard. the Danes dropped their
second contest of the season. ll-J.
Outhit l3 to 6.and plagued by defen-
sive lapses in the ﬁeld. the Danes
were never in the game.

Marilyn Hinden went thcdistance

for Albany giving up eight earned
runs on | | hits and one walk. Albany
C'oach Lee Rhenish was pleased with
Hinden‘s pitching, but hopes for
more offense and fewer errors in the
field in upcoming games.

As for her team‘s 0-2 start.
Rhenish indicated that her team is
not less talented then any of the
others they have faced. but that the
new members of the team didn‘t
know each other well enough yet.
the result is indecision on the
players' parts in the field.

I‘he Danes try for their first win
today when they face Union.

cording to ' Motta, narrowed
Brockport‘s lead to 8-7 in the middle
of the period. '

But at this point, attackman Ken
Sweeny of Brockport started his
rampage on the Danes‘ defense,
scoring 40 seconds after Heimerle‘s
goal. Sweeny netted seven goals on
the afternoon, ﬁve in the second half.
“He was unbelievable, just un-
believable." said Motta.

The Danes couldn't get any closer
than l2-l0 in the ﬁnal period.
Brockport tallied two goals in the
last 40 seconds. which made the’glme
appear more one-sided than it actually
was.
