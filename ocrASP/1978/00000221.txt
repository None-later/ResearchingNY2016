(laid up against the cold. the

home on Saturday. the Albany State
varsity baseball te'a'm'continued their
turnaround. The Danes won the ﬁrst
game of the doubleheader 9L7. then
played to an 8-8 tie in the second.

“lt‘was brutal," said'Albany coach
Bob" Burlingame. “The. way the
weather was. it just wasn't a day for
baseball.” 1 ‘ i

The uncomfortable conditions
changed the nature of the ﬁrst game
immediately. Potsdam‘s second
batter lifted a long fly to centerﬁeld.
and in the swirling wind it dropped
for a double. Potsdam capitalized on
the situation by scoring two ﬁrst in-
ning runs off Dane starting pitcher
Jim Bittker.

Albany's ﬁrst time up was an ex-
treritely proﬁtable one. Eight Danes
came to bat. and when the dust
settled. five Albany runners crossed
the plate. A big hit in the scoring
spree was Ed Sellers' hard line drive
double into leftﬁeld to knock in two
runs. Two batters later. Mike
Mirabella overshadowed his team-
mate. blasting a long home run over
the leftfield fence. good for three
runs batted in.

mented Mirabella". “I wasjtist trying
to,  good contact. and’l really
didn't expect to hit it out."‘

The Danes scored solo runs in
each of the next two innings. Mike
Barg led off the second inning with a
double.'and scored on RogerPlan-
tier's‘pop-ﬁy that fell in for an RBl
double. In the third, Mirabella came
up again. and out went the ball
again. The powerful Dane catcher
plastered a fastball over the leftﬁeld
fence. 330 feet away. giving him four
RBl‘s in two swings of the bat.

“After the ﬁrst homer. l was sur-
prised he eame in with a fastball my
next time up." stated Mirabella. “I
thought he would give me nothing'
but junk pitches.“

lead to 7-4. and brought relief
pitcher Paul Cohen to the mound to

freshman Bittker.

“Jimmy was tiring." explained
Burlingame. “He had thrown a lot of
pitches in his ﬁve innings."

Atmospheric Sciences Professor
Harry Hamilton has charged that
Albany Mayor Erastus Corning
usingle-handcdly blocked" his bid
for a seat on the New York State
Board of Regents because of a
personal grudge.

Hamilton was nominated to fill a
vacant third judicial district seat on
the board along with Albany
psychiatrist and educator Dr. Arlene
Reed-Delaney. Reed-Delaney was
voted in by the state legislature
earlier this month. Both are black.

Recd-Dclaney‘s name was
nominated by Albany Democratic
Assemblyman Richard Conners
who Hamilton claims acted under
the instructions of Coming. also a
Democrat. Hamilton said that
Conners' overt backing of Reed-
l)elaney swung the vote in her favor.

“He‘s one of Corning‘s boys."
Hamilton said of Connors. “and
since his is the seat-holding third
district. the other legislators keyed
their votes off of his lead. and l was
defeated."

Corning was absent from his

I office last week. and could not be

reached at home. A spokesman for

his office refused comment. saying
"there‘s nobody here that can speak
for the Mayor."

According to an Assembly staffer.
there is no formal procedure for
filling vacant Regents seats. He said.
however. that common practice calls
for the Education Committees of
both housed to screen applicants.
most ofwhom are educators or in the
education ﬁeld.

A new Regent is selected by a vote
of both houses ofthe legislature at a
joint session.

Both Hamilton and Reed-
Delaney were approved by the
Education Committes in each house.
Hamilton said that Corning denied
him the position because “things that
l have been working for oppose his
type of administration.“

Hamilton is quite active in the
black community. and is currently
president of the Albany chapter of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.

Hcsaid that over the past ten years
he and Coming have locked horns
on a number ofoccasions over issues
affecting blacks in Albany.

Research Probation Period Lifted

by Aron Smith

A probation period placed in OC-
tobcr on human subject research at
SUNYA will be terminated l‘hurs-
day. according to Psychology
Department Chair (Jordon Gallup.

The probation period was im-
posed by the State Health Depart-
ment after SUNYA was charged
with numerous health codc
violtttions. ranging front conducting
research involving "risk" to the use
of coercion in obtainingvoluntecrs.

According to Assistant Vice Presi-
dent for Research George Frungos
the probation period allowed the
Department of Health to observe the
process by which research proposals
involving human subjects are
reviewed at SUNYA.

The Department‘s chief concern.
he said. was that all such proposals
be considered by. a review board

which met standards set by the
Department of Health. Education
and Welfare.

" I'hc end of the probation period
won't mean ttnylliirtg iii terms of
day-to-duy business." sttid (izillup.
"'l'hcrc are probably just rcd tnpc
details that will change."

Prior to the Health Department
investigation. two SUNYA boards
were reviewing human subject
research proposals: ti University-
widc Institutional Review Board.
and a Psychology Department
review board. The Psychology
Department's review board was con-
sidered illegal under HEW
regulations because its members
were all associated with the same
academic department. and because it
did not include any members from
outside the University community.

According to Frangos. all propos-

  

fire. housing. education, literally
every facet of the city have met with
resistance from the mayor‘s office."
Hamilton said.

In I972. according to Hamilton.
the so-called Corning Bill was
defeated by a narrow margin of the
legislature when Hamilton
convinced the legislature's black
caucus to oppose it as a threat to
minority representation.

The bill would have made
Board of Education seats filled by
mayoral appointment. and not by
education-

The two were polarized again.
claimed Hamilton. when Corning
sided with construction unions in an
attempt to preVent federally
financed on-the-job training for
minority workers.

Hamilton also said that Corning
successfully blocked his bid in l976
for the chair of the Albany
delegation to the Democratic
National Convention.

Hamilton stopped short of
labeling Corning‘s allcgcd actions as
racist.

“Let's just say that he has a long
memory. and that it is in his best
