The SUNYA Presidential Search
Committee still hasn't decided
whether to invite candidates to
appear at open meetings with faculty
and student groups. even though the
topic has been discussed at recent
meetings.

The committee is in what Assis-
tant Vice President for University
Affairs SorrellChesin called The
final stage of its search for a perma-
nent replacement to former SUNYA
President Emmett Fields. it is
currently considering about six can-
didates.

The committee will decide about
holding open meetings in time to in-
sure that such meetings could take
place before the semester ends.
Chesin said. Chesin serves as Ex-
ecutive Secretary to the Search
Committee.

He would not say if any of the
committee's current list of can-
didates have visited Albany to meet
with search committee members.
Search Committee Chair .|. Vander-
bilt Straub could not be reached for
comment.

Chesin said that meetings with
SUNYA groups. like those held dur-
ing the last presidential search three
years ago. would provide the search
committee with input from various
SUNYA constituencies before its
final decision is made. Responses
from those who met with the can-
didates would be considered by the
committee. he said.

“The committee may not take that
step. bill if it does invite the catt-
didates for full campus visits it
would do so prior to making its
recommendation." Chesin said.

Dialogue with different SUNYA
constitucnccs couldualso give the
candidates rtn opportunity to get a
first-hand view of the university, he
added.

Chcsin said the committee is ttot

  

 

issuing any reports on its progress
because of the confidentiality of the
work with which it is currently in-
volved. .

“The committee is feeling reluc-
tant to make any public statement
now." Chesin said. “I can‘t say
anything for the committee other
than that they‘re in the ﬁnal stage of
their work."

For the past few years the Search
Committee has been extending in-
vitations to. and making plans to
meet with. a final pool of candidates.
The names of all the candidates the
committee has considered during the
search. have been keptconfidential.

The committee met last week. and
is scheduled to meet again Wednes—
day. according to Chcsin.

The search committee's Work is
only one stage of the search process.
The committee will recommend one
or more names to the SUNYA Un.
iversity Council. Chesin said. which
will review the recommendations
before passing them on to the 8 UN Y
Board of Trustees. The Trustees will
actually appoint the next SUNYA
President.

The committee should make a
ptiblic statement soon. Chcsin said.
which might indicate if it plans to
hold candidate meetings with the
public. He said he could not estimate
how soon the statement would hi!

“At this point. there is so much

Creegan: UFOs May Be For Real

by Susan Dearstyne

"Unidentified Flying Objects
The UFO Phenomenon.“ was the ti-
tle of a rccettt lecture given by
SUNYA Philosophy Professor
Robert Crcegan ut the New York
State Museum. He contends that
“the UFO is worth scholarly atten-
tion and in fact affects almost every
part of our culture.

“Him and fiction. religious and
archaeological interpretations.
astronomers and meteorologists are
all affected by this international
problem." said Crcegau.

Discussion of the probability of
life outside this planet. possible
methods of contact with tlntt life.
and examining the reports are all

for the past six years.

“ l'lte credibility of U I“() sightings
has become far more tenable.“
Crecgan said.

"With the advent of the Freedom
of information Act. the United
States government has made public
many documents that reveal its in-
terest in UFOs.“

One sighting of strange bright ob-
jects in Tehran was reported with
priority to the Secretttryof'Stnte. the
CIA. the White House and many
other high ranking individuals. livctt
NASA has a special project entitled

tion to individuals upon request,

There are six types of sightings.
Among them tire close encounters of
the first kind. where a UFO is seen
at close range there is no interac-
tton. In close encounters ot the sc-
cond kind. there is some permanent
evidence of its existence. such as
burned or scorched vegetation. In
close encounters of tile third ktttd.
the presence of “occupants"nttd/or
"operators" in or ttbout the UN) is
reported.

Acting SUNYA President Vincent
O'Leary has been reappointed by
US. Attorney General Grifﬁn Bell
to a second three-year term as Chair
of the National Institute of Correc-
tions‘ Advisory Board.

O'Lcary. former Dean of the
School for Criminal Justice at
SUNYA and one of the foremost
auhtorities on corrections in the
country. said the position “will in no
way interfere" with his duties here at
SUNYA.

The NIC. a separate federal agen-
cy of the Justice Department es-
tablished by Congress in I974.
provides a national forum for
creating and maintaining “effective
and human correctional programs
across the U.S.." according to
()‘Lcary.

The Institute assists federal. state.
and local correctional agencies in
maintaining and improving their
programs through correctional
management training. technical
assistance. and sponsoring research
attd information projects.

The l6 member advisory board
()‘l.eary heads is made up of correc-

' v (w

 

   
 
 
 

tions experts from around the coun-
try. including the head of the Federal
Bureau of Prisons and the Dean of
the ChicagoLaw School. V

The board meets three times a year
in Washington D.C; to set policy for
NIC operations, evaluate current
and proposed projects. and allocate
the lnstitute‘s $l0 million budget.
Although the board‘ members have
f ull-time positions elsewhere. the
NIC maintains a full-time staff in
Washington year-round to carry out
projects and implement the policy
and standards set by the board.

O‘Leary said the NIC tries to come
up with answers to questions like
“who do you put injail. when do you
let them out. and what do you do to
keep them from coming back?"

As Chairperson. O‘Leary ap—
points members of the board to com-
mittees which provide grant money
to sponsor seminars. panel dis-
cussions. and public hearings that
bring together corrections experts.

offenders. The committees then

Class Of ’81 Election Made Ofﬁcial

Sic-gel said the fivcjnstlces present at
Sichrbcrg's hearing unanimoust
decided tltttt there was not enough
evidence to prove or disprove the
allegations made by either party.
They let the election results stand.

Aronson claimed that Silverberg
had told voters during the elections
that he (Aronson) lived off-campus.
was a non-matriculated student. and
didn't meet ballot qualifications.

David (iross said Silvcrberg denied
having tnadc these statements at the
Supreme Court hearing. (iross said
Silvcrberg had earlier ndtuitted to
him llntt he had spread the rumors.

Arouson said he met all the
qtntlil'ications to run. and was not a
non-mntrictlnlted student. He lives
on Dutch Quad. nttd was tint on the
ballot because he was late in getting

“Silvcrberg also told me that he
had approached people and told
them that l hadn't met certain
qualifications.“ Aronsou said.

Silverberg denied this at the

to built Gross attd Arottson.

“The allegations hurt Aronson."
Gross said. “llut they were not intert-

troubleshooting center in Colorado
that provides technical assistance
and advice to jails all otter the coun-

try.

The NIC also deals with aspects of
the operation of correctional
facilities which are “not very fancy.
but terribly important.“ according to
O'Leary. These include communica-
tion problems between guards and
offenders. as well as emergency on-
the-spot diagnosis by non-doctors.

"Say an offender doesn’t speak
English. and a guard says ‘Come
over here‘, and the offender doesn‘t
move.“ O‘Leary said. “The guard is
confronted with a prisoner not
following an order. so what does he
do?“ O'Leary asked.

To alleviate this problem. one
NIC project sponsored the produc-
tion of small pocket dictionaries
with common words and phrases to
be provided for guards and nonv
English-speaking prisoners to
facilitate communication.

local jails around the country is

The most likely prospect for a

that the committee was in the final

engagements. We‘re dealing with

mostly allegations.“ Siegcl said.
“There was nothing definite.“

Silvcrberg said he presented live
signed affidavits at the court henring
frotn witnesses lie said backed tip his
contention that he lutdrt‘t spread
allegations.

Aroltsoti said he didn‘t lilitlh’
Silverhcrg‘s petitions addressed the
charges.

“I‘m sure it‘s true. tltttt ltc didn‘t

other people.“

At'onsnn submitted an affidavit
signed by a studnet named l’aul
Murdy certifying that Silverberg lntd
approached Murdy and told him
that Aronson was deemed un-
qualified by SA. Murdy's roommate
also signed the affidavit saying he
witnessed the exchange.

Aronson is listed in tile student
directory as a nun-matriculated stu—
dent. although he is fully
matriculated. Last semester. when
the directories wen: printed. he was
not a full time tnutricunltion student.

Silverbcrg acknowledged that he‘d
discovered the listing. but denied
having used it to influence voters he
