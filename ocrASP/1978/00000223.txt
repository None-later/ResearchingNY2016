(PNS) Jackie is seven years old. He
has never gone to school. He works
for a man who gives him 20 nick/e
bags of marijuana to .tell each day.
He earn: $60 a week. He
is three and a half feet
tall. Black. cute and
smart. He read: book:
and wears a Bob Marley
T-sht'rt. He would like to buy a
horse. He would like to get a Snoopy
watch. And he would like to ﬁnd his
grandmother. Last in a series.

l0 October

I saw Jackie at 86th Street and
Broadway. He turned and waved at
me. “Don‘t think [didn‘t see you,“ he
said. “You‘re not a good spy or
anything." No. I‘m not a good spy.
But where had he been?

“I have been with Marty mostly.
He's my friend. His mother likes to
hit. Just when she gets drinking. But
she don‘t hit me. I bring her a can of
cold Budweiser."

We sit on a park bench across
from the Museum of Natural
History. “I have a phone. you know.
I could call you if you want right
where you live. But do you have
children at your house with a father?
Sometimes people don't, you know.
My father flies a plane that makes
spelling in the sky. It‘s a big. round
plane. Can you get me a ride on one?
Not the regular kind. the big round
one like a balloon."
l2 October

Hotcl Opera is on Broadway
between 77th and 78th Streets.
Jackie's friend Marty lives here.
Wlicn I knocked on her fourth-ﬂoor
door. Alma. Marty's mother. pcekcd
her head through a crack in the door.

workers. Mind .my own businesal.
Don't bother nobody. Just drink my
beer." ‘

She let me in when I came back
with a six-pack of Budweiser. Two
twin beds and a television ﬁlled the
room. which looked out on a back
alley.

Yes, she knows Jackie. He's been
coming around for six or seven
months now. She's never met a nicer
boy. Most weeks he lends her SIO to
get her through till herwelfare check
comes.

A knock on the door interrupted
her. We could hear heavy breathing
on the other side. A roach travelling
the door jamb made a detour over
the grease-soaked scarf on her head.
She smacked at the roach and her
hand hit the door.

“Baby. I know‘you‘re there." a
man‘s voice slurred from the other
side. “Just want to feel your behine.
‘Causc it‘s so ﬁne. Fine. Fine. Fine."
We heard his voice trailing down the
hallway. softly singing. “That behine
is so damn ﬁne."

"He do that every night," Alma
said. “Just like clockwork.
Goddamn wine. I ain't pretty no
more.” she said. “bit I ain‘t never like
winos.“

Marty came home before I left.
Hc‘s short for 10. He ignored me.
said. “Hi. Alma." to his mother. and
crossed the room to the television
set.

“Don't turn that on. boy." his
mother told him. This lady wants to
know about Jackie. She brung inc
beer."

Marty smiled and sat down next
to me on the bed. His jeans were
starchcd with dirt.

“You Jackie‘s mother. lady‘l He
tole ‘me you getting him a horse. I
want one too.”

Many told me that Jackie is his
best friend and Jackie has a job and
he might get Marty a job too. Yes.
Marty has seen the man Jackie lives
with. “It ain't his daddy, though.
This guy is big and tall and he's got
stacks of money. He'll give you a
dollar if you tell him who's coming
up the stairs." Marty said that Jackie
has a nice room with ﬂowers in it and
his own radio. He's never met
Jackie‘s grandmother and he doesn't
know why Jackie doesn't go to
school.
l5 October

Jackie called me for the ﬁrst time
this morning. We decided to meet
downtown at Washington Square
.Park. Does he know where that is'.’
“lfyou mean the park with the castle
tunnel, sure I know."

I took him to a friend‘s house
where they were showing
“Forbidden Games," a movie about
a five-year—old girl living irt war time
France whose parents are killed ina
bombing. She is adopted by a
peasant family and becomes friends
with their ll-ycar-old son.
Surrounded by war. the children
spend their days building and
tending a burial ground for dead
animals.

Later. when I walked him to the
subway. Jackie said, “I liked that
movie with those children in
wartimcs. I like the bury place they
made for animals because it's nice
and God must come there. Now. is
this real? I seen this bury place for
people with all the big angels on top
and they're real close together right

next to each other. They smoke
cigarettes down there and laugh a lot
and that‘s where we go when we die.
My grandmother told me so. She‘s
not dead. you know. She went tothe
place where it‘s green so her hands
will come down and the wrinkles will
go away. They have trees there and
grass. Now. your fatheris in the bury
place smoking and having fun. My
grandmother isn't there. But I know
