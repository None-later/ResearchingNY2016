he above is an excerpt from a
letter written by Batshcva
Yelistratov, who along with
her husband Victor, has been
trying to leave Russia for the
past seven years. Since I972, the
Yelistratovs have been denied permission
to leave Russia eight times with no
explanation. The couple have refused to

From Russia With Mixed Emotions

The following are excerpts from an
interview with Jerry and Myrna
l.efkowit/ on their recent trip to Russia.

Jewish Students‘ Coalition: How did

you first gel involved in the cause of

.S'ovt'et Jewry."

Jerry Lefkowitz: At the urging of our
friends. we went to Russia and met with
the Refusniks [people who have asked for
and have been denied permission to leave
the USSR]

JSC: What was the (fl/eel o/‘the (fl/)4”! 1

your involvement with this muse."

Myrna Lefkowitz: Once you tnect
people. people who need help and are
really unable to get it, whateverlittle you
do becomes very important. You become
very involved even it you‘re not sure how
helpful it's actually going to be. You‘re
not talking with names, you‘re talking
with people. people who have families.
people with whom you‘ve related. people
yott‘ve come to know. When you leave,
it's the laces you remember.

JSC: Did you have any trouble getting
through t‘uJ‘lrIlllJ‘."

M. Lefkowitl: lherc was an extensive
search at the airport. Everything was
looked through. However. our pass in
customs was no more stringent than
anyone clsc‘s. Many items were
consliscated including guide books,
Bibles brought in by priests, other
religious literature. and any literature
deemed contrary to the Russian position

JSC: ()Itt‘eyou were In Russia. tlitl the
authorities realt:e that one of t'ttttl'
purposes was to visit the re/itinilm,‘

accept this, and have participated in
numerous rallys to protest the actions of
the Soviet government. On March 8,
I978, Women‘s International Day,
Batsheva was one of 23 women who
attempted to demonstrate for exit visas at
the Lenin Library near the Kremlin. The
women chose this day because. as they
declared, “On this day. the rights of
women in the USSR are celebrated. Our
cases may illustrate what these rights
mean in practice." As a result of this
demonstration, ten of the women
(including Batsheva) were arrested and
imprisoned for the remainder ofthe day.
To request permission to leave Russia
usually results in serious repercussions. ln
Victor‘s case it involved the loss of hisjob.
and the removal of his telephone. The
Yelistratovs have periodically been
placed under house arrest, imprisoned.
and have suffered physical abuse.
Unfortunately, this is typical ofthe life
of many Jewish dissidents requesting
permission to emigrate from the Soviet

information about the case of Yoscl'
Begun. I said I wanted the information so
I could write a report on the case. Yoscf
liegun was on trial for a charge of
parasitism [a refusal to work] and as l atn
a labor lawyer. I had decided to try and
intercch on his behalf. Begun‘s charge
was phony because the reason he wasn't
working was that once he applied to

 

 

   

Union. Despite these consequences,
many Soviet Jews continue in their ﬁght
to leave Russia, many feeling that their
situation cannot deteriorate any further.
At the present time. the Soviet
government restricts the right of Jews to
learn of and to partake in their culture,
and to observe their religious beliefs.
While it is possible to obtain some books
about Jewish culture. the Soviet
government finds ways to ban most of
them.

While teaching Hebrew is illegal. some
Jews form secret study groups in order to
learn both the language and the culture
that is the Jewish heritage, but they
frequently take immeasurable risks by
doing so. There are a few synagogues in
Russia, but they are controlled by the
KGB (Soviet secret police) and the people
attending them are constantly being
watched. Although all citizens of Russia
are denied freedom as defined in
America, the Jews are one of the most
persecuted groups. Last year, antisemitic

leave. the government made sure he
couldn‘t get a job. He did teach Hebrew
but as this is illegal in Russia. the
government Wouldn't accept his taxes.

Because of our involvement with the
dissidents. the authorities made sure that
the phones were out oforder in each hotel
room we were in and in some instances
the dissidents pointed out the KGB
people who were following us.

JSC: We know that many people on
campus have been writing letters to
Soviet rejitsttt’lts. Do these letters ever
reach them, and (fro, what effect do they
have.’l

M. lefkowltz: Some reach them and
some don't. Even when they don't they
have the effect of insulating these
rcl'usniks lrotn further trouble because
the authorities feel that they are known in
the west. l'hc letters that do get through
have a tremendous effect on the
dissidents. lwould like to tell youa story
which further convinced me of the
importance of letter writing. One night at
one of the dissident‘s homes, we met a
man who had the shorn haircut of a
prisoner and who had a battered face. We
learned that he had just returned after
having served for twu years in a labor
camp on a trumped-up charge. We asked
him if there was anything at all we could
dolor him. His face lit up and he reached
itito his puck and he took out a worn
address hook. in it were listed all the
names of the people who had
corresponded with him while he was
incarcerated. He read us the list and asked
us to send thank you letters to them
because he didn‘t know whether any of

 
 
 

cartoons appeared in the governors t- ,
controlled party newspaper Pravda, and, 
on soviet television: The duration is I
grave onethlt warrants world concern.

To bring attention to this situation,
SUNYA‘s Jewish Studento’ Coalition in:
adopted the cause of Victor and Batahevo
Yelistratov. For the past one and a half
years, JSC has been sponsoring letter-
writing campaigns, informative
breakfasts and other programs to help the
couple. Through correspondence with the
Yelistratovs it has been stressed that the
best way to help is to write Soviet Jews
letters; to them and on behalf of them, as
well as to publicly show support fortheir
plight.

Tommorrow, April 25, JSC is
sponsoring a rally on behalf of Victor and
Batsheva Yellstratov. The rally will begin
at H a.m. in front of the Campus Center
and is expected to draw such notables as
Governor Hugh Carey. The rally
coincides with the fourthday of Passover,
a holiday that is celebrated by Jews all
over the world, commemorating the
exodus of the Jews from Egypt. It is a
fitting time to remember that there are
still Jews in this day and age that are held
against their will.

the letters he would send would get
through. He felt that not only had these
letters made him feel remembered, but he
felt that they had lessened his hardships
while in prison because the authorities
knew that he was known abroad.

JSC: You've obviously had a moving
aml interesting experience in Russia. Is
there any special time when you think
about the people you've met.“

M. Letkowitl: Every Friday night
when I light my Sabbath candles. one of
my sons lights asingle candle in a Russian
candlestick. As I was leaving the home of
Dina Bellian, a Russian dissident. she
took one of a pair of candlesticks and
gave it to me. I‘m so glad she did. livery
Friday night when we sit dqul to enjoy
our freedom. we remember those Russian
Jews who are unable to enjoy their
freedom. We light the candle on their
behalf until they are free and are able to
light the candle themselves.

Before you go. I want to tell you about
a very interesting experience I had here in
Albany three weeks ago. l he first people
we had contacted in Moscow were the
Slepaks. Alexander Slepak has
subsequently married an American
woman and is now touring the United
States and Europe on behalf of his
parents and on behalfofall other Russian
.lewry. We were so happy that when he
was in Albany. he spent time iti our home.
Who would have ever thought when we
were in Russia in May that the first
person in who‘s home we had accepted
hospitality would be in our home and able
to accept ottr hospitality? It was a very.
very good feeling.
