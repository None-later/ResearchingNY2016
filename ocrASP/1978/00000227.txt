Too bad your mind is so warped and sick
We hope you all listened with a very close

And heard all that you wanted to hear
You know that all we would say was true
We have nothing to hide, how oboutyau?
You know we would have said something
you didn't want all to know
Your true colors and the real you it would
show

So bugging the room and all listening in
created quite a 0
Too bad you made your presence known
when we came to you
Hope now you've had your little lun
Others are hurt now that it's done
Now that rt's all over we hope you are

You should realice you wentone step too Ior
Because now all have seen you “Just the
