‘5, David Spiro
' Last Thursday, the Albany State

'1 tennis team travelled to Amherst to

.plsy their second match in a week
against a Division I squad. The
result was exactly the same as in their
previous match against Colgate as
they lost another frustrating 6-3
decision.

Once again the competition was
moved indoors due to the weather
and once again it was decided early,
‘ns Amherst, like Colgate. took five
out of the six singles matches from
the Danes.

' This was also another match that
the Danes could very well have
won. Not all of Our guys played as
wellasthey could have." said Albany
coach Bob Lewis.

“I'm very conccrncd that we're los-

I’ing a lot of three sct matches." added
. Lewis. whose Danes lost four out of
'»Iivc thrcc sct matches against
Amherst in addition to two of two
{against Colgate.
