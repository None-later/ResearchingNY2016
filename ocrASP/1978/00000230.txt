“We really didn't expect to do this

well." said Mike Hellerman. who got

the team together. Certainly not as

far as the regionisl championships.
However. afterdefeating teams from
Columbia, Adelphi. Oneonta. Stony
Brook and Union. Albany stood as
New York State Champions and
host team of the regionals. And they
stood ready to take on theopponents
in quest of some niftyprizes courtesy
of Budweiser and a vacation in sun-
ny Florida.

Each team is comprised of five
men and three women. Points were
awarded for finishes: If) for first. l2
for second. etc. The day started
promising for the Albany squad.
After the volleyball and beer-toss
competitions, the team stood tied for
first place.

The big disappointment ofthc day
was Brockport's dismal performance
in the beer-con toss. With their
reputation as nationally-ranked par-
ty school at stake. Brockport drew a
blank in beer-can chucking
perhaps beer chugging would have
suited them better.

As the compctition moved out-
side. Albtiny began to shine. This
was the frisbec-throwing contest.
and the Positive Transfer team Wits
definitely ready. When the weather
warms up. the frisbcc is king on this
campus. It is thrown by Albany
students from Alden Hall to lndian
Quad. from Quail St. to thc foun-
tains on the podium. And it is
thrown well.

While podiating. one can check
out the frisbcc-fnniitics: those who
can fling ti frisbee and have it limit
anywhere they want it to, One ol
those is JeffGibcoult. who threw the

disc 95 feet into a stiff wind. landing
it right on the mark. it was worth
ﬁrst place and added optimism.

That optimism was short lived.
however. as Albany‘s chances of vic-
tory clouded as fast as the sky did. In
the 880 relay. a baton was passed
from an athlete from Villanova. who
was running in the second lane. In-
stead of remaining in that lane. the
runner who passed the baton cut into
Albany's lane. slowing down the
Albany runner. Fifteen minutes of
arguments ensued. and the judges
decided to let the Albany squad to
run again.

“Our time was two seconds
better." said Hellermttn. “But it was
tough  we could have done better
the ﬁrst time. After runninga race as
hard as we could. we were told that
we hiid to do it all over again. This
made us lose our momentum.“

Albany was blanked in that event.
and stood in ti three-way tie for se-
cond place after the obstacle course.
Brockport was first and the whole
thing now was up to one event: the
tug-of—war. The University of
Maryland squad. who had been
trailing most of the way. easily
defeated Villtinova as Albany gtiincd
ti byc. The Positive Trtliislcr squad
had to face this determined
Maryland team.

The Maryland team had. tICC()I'~
ding to coach lid Fcigclcs. spent a
good amount of money on this corti-
pciitioii. lhctr eight-person team
had to beat out 39 other teams to
gain the privilege of representing
Maryland. l‘CIgclcs wtis accom-

screamcd. “We‘ve been on the bot-
tom iill day. it's time for us to show
everyone who's tops". They yelled
that and till the other baloney things
coaches are supposed to yell.

It was obvious that the spark was
in the Maryland team. while the
Albany squad had lost theirs in the
controversial Silo-relay. The day had
grown cold and the athletes looked
Worn.

As the judges signalled the begin-
ning of the tug. it was obvious that it
would he no contest. The Albtiiiy
team was easily pulled across the
lllltli Iiiic.

Maryland went on to win the
whole thing and will be heading
south in early May. After their vic-
tory. both coaches screamed and
hollered so loud that the echoes
could probably be heiird on Colonial
Quad.

Ripped Off

“We were ripped off." one Albany
athlete said afterwards. He picked
up the first trophy which was sitting
in ii Budweiser van. “This thing
should say ’Alhany State’ on it.“ The
other team members applauded and
laughed as the athlete stuffed ti:
trophy under his swctitshirt in ii

mock attempt to “rip off" the prize.

For the Albany team. there would
be no trip to Florida. After losing
another meaningless tug to
Villanova. Positive Transfer finished
fourth out ofthe five teams. The cold
weather had set in as afternoon laps-
ed into evening. Maryland would be
soaking up the Florida rays instead.
and the cold Albany climate made
that point all too clear.

As the Maryland team celebrated
one Albany rootcr looked over their
collection of athletes and made the
final assessment of the day: "Well,
we've got the cutest tenm.unyway."
