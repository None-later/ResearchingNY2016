With youth and comraderie in
their favor, the Albany State varsity
track and ﬁeld squad has won three
of their first four meetsofthe season.
compiling a 5-l record. The Danes‘
only loss has been to RPI in an open-
ing meet split.

“It's a very close team." said
Albany coach Bob Munscy. “It‘s a
very happy team ~ it's great fun.“
Only six seniors and juniors are on
the 45-member squad. whose most
recent victories have been over
llinghamton and Buffalo on Satur-
day. and against Plattsburgh on
Wednesday. a 81-67 verdict.

In Saturday's meet. Albany over-
powered both schools. scoring I33
points in comparison with Buffalo‘s
(ii and Binghamton‘s 13. “That wasu
pretty easy win.“ said Munsey.

l he Danes' Jimmy Pollard notch-
ed three ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes in the
triangular competition. The junior
triumphed in the |20 high hurdles
(l5.0). IUD-yard dash HO.” and the
high jump (six feet).

John Veruto hurled ﬁrst-place
throws in the discuss and javcfin for

Albany. 1n the latter event. Veruto
was only one inch shy of the qualify-
ing distance for the state meet which
will be held in the middle of May.

"Veruto has stocked up ottr
weakest are (weight events) . . .
he's a winner." said Munscy. 'l'hc
mphomorc placed second in the shot
ptit. With senior Lou Robin. a four-
ycar performer. grabbing fourth
place in the event.

Al Bennett won the pole vault to
add to Albany's string of victories.
Dennet also took fourth place in the
javelin. Jim Cunningham. whose
strong event is the hurdles. finished
in third place in the weight event.

The Danes have their version of
the “Bionic Man.“ according to
Munscy. Don Dross. a sophomore.
offers his assistance in a variety of
events. But Dross' specialities re-

main the long jump and the 440-yard

intermidate hurdles. evidenced by
first-place performances in both
events.

An indication of Albany's youth
was seen in the mile-relay. Three
freshmen. Jeff Baker. Brian ,Cuddy
and Erik Shultz, combined with
sophomore Steve Kaplan to win the
event.

Kaplan looked “absolutely fan-
tastic“ in the 880 yard-run. accor-
ding to Munsey. Freshmen Jim
Spangler and Bill Reinhardt were
behind Kaplan. in third and fourth
place. respectively.

second-place finish to secure the vic—
tory. “The score SCCrSBWCd buck and
forth." explained Munscy.

Veruto ended all concern by win-
ning the event with it hurl of l44 feet.
Although it was his shortest throw of
the season. Veruto‘s effort was
enough. Jim Johnson and Con-
ningham completed the sweep in the
event. and nailed down an Albany
victory.

Surprisingly there were no double
winners for Albany on this after-
noon of steady rain. Despite the
weather though. the mile-relay team
of Dross. Kaplan. Cuddy and Baker
combined for their best time of the
season.

Freshmen Jeff Simon and Bill
Condon finished 1-2 in the triple
jump. Other Albany winners
were Lonnie Davis in the 220-yard
dash. John Little in the three mile-
run and Brass in the 440-yard iii-
termediate hurdles.

jump for the first time this year.

called a “tremendous time" of 55.9.

“He has an amazing

attackman. “I don‘t think their

As for the game itself. it was
almost decided by the end of the ﬁrst
quarter. Albany pumped in four
goals while Potsdam pumped air.
The second period was just as bad
for Potsdam. Albany scored three
and Potsdam one.

“It was our best performance of
the year.“ said an elated Motta after
the game. “We moved the ball well
offensively. Everything was just go-
ing well. The only problem was we

LcMoyne had amassed live runs on

"That's what happens when you
get the ball up high." added

Prof VisitsAs Pres Candidate

by Aron Smith

A man who as recent its one week
ago was considered a candidate for
the position of SUNYA president
said he visited the campus last
weekend at the invitation of the
Presidential Search Committee.

Victor 0. Rosenblum. a professor
at Northwestern University Law
School in Chicago. said he visited
the campus “to determine the extent
of my interest in the position.“

Search Contmittcc Executive
Secretary Sorrcll l3. Chesin would
not comment on whether
Rosenbluni or any other candidates
have visited the campus.

“There were chances for sortie
mutual exchange of educational
views." said Rosenblum. "i really
didn‘t go try as an applicant or with
any kind of expectations that there
will be any immediate follow-up to
ll. The question was ‘would you be
willing to be considered a can—
didate'?‘ The answer was yes."

0 101. by Albany Student Press Corporation

Chesin. reiterating that the search
process is, a conﬁdential and
sometimes sensitive one. refused to
conﬁrm or deny Rosenblum‘s can-
tlidacy.

Rosenblum. who served as Presi-
dent of Reed College in Oregon for
two years. received his un—
dergraduate and law degrees from
Columbia University in New York.
and took a doctorate in political
science at the University of Califor-
iiiaat Berkcly. He wasiilso conferred
Doctor of Humane Letters. an
honorary degree. at Hebrew Union
College in Cincinnati. Ohio.

His previous contacts with
SUNYA include membership on the
advisory committee to a research
project undertaken several years ago
by a professor in SUNYA‘s School
of Criminal Justice.

"I know the campus." said
Rosenblttm. "l have the highest
respect for the faculty. students arid
administration We met. and I‘m

very flattered.“
Search Committee

proximately six finalists will be kept
confidential. However. a second

round of interviews. to be held after

the number of candidates is reduced
further. may be open to the SUNYA
community at large. according to
Chesin.

“lfand when the Committee is in a
final stage in which it wishes to invite
candidates for ftill visits it would
engage all constituencies in the
process and it would be announced
to the campus." said Chcsiii. “ This is
the procedure followed in the last
search.“ he said. referring to the I975
search in which Emmett Fields was
named SUNYA President.

Although the final few candidates
will all visit the campus. some
preliminary interviews may be held
elsewhere. according to Chesin.

Martin Prodded On Kendall Report

by Jill Haber
and Matthew Cox

Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs David Martin said yesterday
he will uct within a week on an
evaluation of College of Social and
Behavioral Sciences Dean Richard
Kendall.

lhc statement came a day after
that college‘s factilty council chair.
l‘rank l’oguc. met with Martin and
asked for a report on the progress of
Martin's deliberation.

Martin is reviewing reports
evaluating the performance of four
SUNYA deans.

Council members were ap-
proached by Social and Behavioral
Sciences faculty and asked about the
length of time Martin was taking in
formulating his recommendations.

The completed Kendall report was
submitted to Martin about two
months ago. according to Philip
Royster. a member of the committee
that conducted the review. It was the
first of the four evaluations to be
submitted to Martin‘s office.

the Kendall report has been
characterized as clear-cut by two
members of the committee.

Several faculty members claim
that the preliminary draft of the,
report is overwhelmingly negative.
although they have not seen it
themselves. Kendall was rated poor-
ly on all four areas of evaluation in-
cluded in the report. they say.

College Council members and
members of the committcethiit con-
ducted the review refused to com-
ment on the content of the report.

Kendall was named dean of the
then-Division of Social and
Behavioral Sciences in spring I974.
He was appointed by former Vice
President for Academic Affairs
Philip Sirotkin. after a search com-
mittee submitted a "no recommen-
dation“ report.

Kendall had been considered by
the search committee. and was
already serving as acting dean on up-
pointment by Sirotkin.

Evaluations of Humanities and
Fine Arts Dean John Schumakcr.

Vincent Cowling. as Well as Library
Director C. James Schmidt. were
begun last semester. They constitute

At 4:30 this morning. the final
tallies in the SA Presidential elec-

lateness of the hour and the large
majorities l’aul Peldman had racked
up on the four uptown quads made
the off-campus and downtown

As results were delivered from LC

waiting for the count in the SA office
celebrated as it became apparent
that not only would Paul win. but
that there would be no run—off. as
there had been last year for Feld-
man.

SA Vice President Kathy Baron
called Feldman's victory "cool" ad-
ding thiit it had been "a Kafkacsque

hope that a good showing off-

into a run-off.

Two hours later. the off-campus
