The Student Dwellings
Corporation. an SA project whose
bid for the purchase of two area
houses collapsed earlier this year, rs

in the early stages of attempting to
establish itself as a landlord again.

The corporation is in the process
of entering into negotiations for the
same two homes it failed to secure
after starting purchase negotiations,
according to SA President David
Gold.

The buildings, located at 3l4 and
316 Hudson Ave. could house
between I! and l2 students injeight
separate apartments.

The corporation. whose board
members consist of SUNYA
administrators and students, was
formed in November of 1976 as an

attempt to ease the housing crunch.

' As it was envisioned it would help by

providing cheep.‘ furnished
apartments for students near the
busline. Central Council earmarked
$20,000 for the project.

Accordingly. Student Dwellings
entered into negotiations for the
Hudson Ave. homes in March of last
year;

However, last September it was
determined that renovations would
cost twice the originally projected
ﬁgure of $33,000. Unable to secure
financing or a mortgage, the

Corporation was forced to withdraw -

from the negotiations and forfeit a
SIOOO deposit.

Gold explained that the
corporation's latest attempt at
purchasing the homes is being

“A major problem was that
everyone on the board had other
duties to attend to,“ he said. “We‘re
going to try to increase faculty and
student participation this time
around."

One proposal, according to Gold,
is to form a Managerial Advisement
Board from Finance 300 students.
They would be given considerable
control of the business aspects of the
project.

In order to secure the estimated
555,000 which would be necessary
for renovation and a mortgage, Gold
said the corporation Would pursue
two routes.

“We're going to ask UAS for a
$25,000 loan." he said, “and SA will
attempt to use some of its funds as
collateral towards a bank
mortgage."

APRIL 28. 1973

“The inevitable reaction against
anti-educational feelings is now tak-
ing place," said President of both the
American and United Federation of
Teachers, Albert Shanker in a lec-
ture decrying the loss of standards in
higher education. The lecture en-
titled “In Defense ofthc University"
was delivered Wednesday afternoon
in the Assembly Hall.

Shanker was unclear, however. on
how academic standards would be
raised.

Heextolled the merits ofthe “back
to basics" approach and supported
“a massive expansion of higher
education“ and an increased
"emphasis on reaching the young
child. which would entail mandatory
schooling at age three."

Shanker strongly criticized the
campus activism of the sixties but
said “although the campus is quiet
today...the university has not return-
ed to normal." Shanker added that

"here is a distinct continuity bet ween

thc politicization of the university
which took place in the sixties and
the amoral utilitarianism which
prevails today.“ l'hc two decades are

“united by a common disregard for
academic excellence," he believes.
In the face of increasing attacks on
publicly funded education “there is
nothing the university needs more
than a, strong organized voice to
speak in itsinterest," Shanker said.
A faculty union could be this voice.
he added, arguing that such a union
could protect academic freedom and
enhance academic standards of ex-
cellence. The audience of one hun-
dred, composed largely of ad-
ministrators and faculty, posed a
number of questions voicing skep-
ticism regarding the appropriateness
or effectiveness of a faculty unidn.

Al the close of the question and

answer period, a young woman rose
from her seat in the rear of the hall
and shouted repeatedly. “This is a

circus.“ She was angered that
Shanker could not be questioned
directly from thc ﬂoor. The
program‘s moderator had instructed
the audience prior to the start ol'thc
lecture that they could pass their
queries on to a panel of three
SUNYA proiessors who would
collate the questions and pose thetn

The woman was angered by this

Shanker opposed affirmative ac-
tion in his lecture. He said that
policies based on what he called
"equality of results" would "lead to

that "we must make it possible for

Faculty/Student Association and
the manager of the bookstore there
have called for tin investigation of
the charges by a University Senate
subcommittee.

According to Statesman news
editor Chris Sairhall. response to the
article and editorial in Monday‘s
paper was “immediate and intense.“
Sairhall said that bookstore
manager Ernest Baker said Monday

tmttion was taken out of context,
and an investigation will show it in Ii
truer light."

According to Burgovoy. the

at the warehouse, but that books
were reconditioned to be sold only as
used books, not new.
