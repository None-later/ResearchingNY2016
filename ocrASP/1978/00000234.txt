 pr... 3.5mm, new; 

by G. Pascal Zachary

For many people the coming of
spring signals a renewed awareness
of our natural surroundings. The

Pine Bush. stretching

News from western Albany

Feature into Guilderland and
Colonic. is an ideal
location for the novice nature-lover.
Within easy reach of the campus.
and covering about 4000 acres. the
Pine Bush contains many species of
plant and animal wildlife unique to
upstate New York.

The Pine Bush is a“i‘ire communi—
ty." according to SUNYA biologist
Margaret Stewart. who hascxplored
the area with students for over two
decades.

"It is fire that maintains this very
special complex ol'specics.“ Stewart
explained. The Pine Bush tires occur
spontaneously. are usually set by
lightning. hurn rapidly. and ex-
tinguiin themselves. With huli'ol'tht:
urea developed for housingand com-
mercial use» this campus is part of
the origionul Pinc Bush arcamthe
number ol tires are decreasing. " l he
nnturc oi llic Ctlllllllllllll) is altered

fairly significantly if ﬁre is kept out." ‘

Dr. Stewart believes. advocating
controlled burning in what remains
of the Pine Bush. ‘ -.

Small sections of the Pine Bush
have been purchased by local and
state governments in an effort to
preserve the area. Environmental ac-
tivists argue that not enough land is
now owned by the government to
allow the Pine Bush to retain its
special. natural characteristics. They
say that the only solution to a shrink-
ing- Pine Bush is for the government
to buy all the land that remains.

With the largest remaining area of
the Pine Bush slated for develop-
ment. the issue of preservation is be-
ing dramatized once again. Albany
Alderman David Sawyer will
propose at the city's Common Coun-
cil meeting Monday that a
moratorium on all development in
the Pine Bush be imposed. That
meeting will be held at City Hall at
7:30. But because the Pine Bush lies
in three municipalities. such a plan-
ning effort would involve the adop-
lion oi similar legislation in all three
localities.‘

 

Play it smooth: just
pour Comiorl" over

ice and have your own
rocks concert. Ncul‘. A
great perionncr with
cola. 7UP. tonic. orange
juice. milk. th.. too!

 

Nothing's so delicious as Southern Cominrt'on-the—rocks!

Sﬂulllﬂllt Emmi" CllllPDilAliol, IN FROM IMUR. 3T ltllIlS. W, Mia!

 

The Pine Bush testiﬁes ot the fact
that under some circumstances fire
and wildlife mix in a way that

‘ Smokey the Bear never dreamed of.

Horse riding. camping. and cross-
country skiing all take place in the
area.

To get to the Pine Bush. according
to John Wilcott. an Albany resident
who has taken up the cause of saving
the area. cut through an open area in
the woods across the street from the
Jewish cemetery on Fuller Road.
The clearing was once part of the
same Madison Ave. that runs
through downtown Albany. Follow
the clearing for aim? one-cigth of a
mile and you‘ll be it a part of what
remains of the area'.

“It‘s a tremendous‘ source of
recreation and rejuvenation.“
Stewart said. With the warm
weather upon us. you should make it
a point to visit and enjoy the Pine
Bush. It may not be around much
longer.

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

Questions were aimed at students in
two general areas: those with ad—
visers in their major departments
and those who are advised at the
Center for Undergraduate Educa-
tion. formerly the University
College.

In response to a question asked of
students with departmental ad-
visors: Does your advisor show an
active interest in you‘.’. 43 per cent of
llic responding students felt that
ihcirs did not. Ihirty tour per cent
said they felt their ndvisors did. and
23 per cent had no opinion. The
percentages were similar when
answers were luhulutcd to the ques-
tion: Is your advisor knowledgepble
oi courses and requirements outside
his department! Seventy-one per
cent ol undergraduates who haven't
declared a major. and are advised at
the Center Ior Undergraduate
liducutiou indicated dissatisfaction
with the qualityol'tlieirudviscmcnt.

“It got progressively worse.
Students had a lowcrund lower opi-
nion of academic ndvrscmcnt as they
got further along in their academic
careers." commented Rel'kin.
Ruskin said most i'nculty members
do not want to do advising

Till? results oi the survey will be
sent this week to the SUNYA Com-
mittee to Review Academic Advise—
ment. which was created by Vice
President lor Academic Affairs
David Martin. Ruskin and Reikin.
along with Micliclc Vass. are the
only students on the committee.
