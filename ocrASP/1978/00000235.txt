SPACE RIGHTS

A Michigan State University
Professor says a series of studies has
found that men tend to dominate
women in day-to-duy activities.

Associate Professor Barrie
Thorne says. for example, that
studies have been conducted on the
manner in which men and women
converse together or move along the
street. I

She reports that men on crowded
street corners tend to spread their
arms and claim more space. while
\vomcn usually pull their limbs in
tightly to avoid collisions.

Observations ui bowling alleys

losses with the mock violence of
buck-thumping and shoulder shov—

WHERE ARE YOU?

The California-based Bank of
America is required to shut down the
inactive accounts of customers they
can‘t locate. and turn over their
assets to the State of California.

This might make sense in the case
of unknown people who drop out of
sight and can't be found anywhere.
despite the bank's best efforts to
Iocnic them. But New Times
Magazine reports in its current issue
that some ofthe inactive customers
the back has been unable to find in-
clude Bob Hope. Lucille Ball. Cun—
dlce Bergen. San Francisco Giants‘
first-baseman Willie McCovcy. and
even the giant Paciﬁc Telephone
Company.

The strangest incident of all. ac-
cording to the magazine. occurred
after It branch of the Bank of
America opened a safety deposit box
in its own name. Sometime later.
that bank was unsuccessful in its
attempt to locate itself. declared the
box unclaimed property and gave
the contents to the state.

When asked about the bank's in-
ability to locate itself. it bank
spokesperson blamed it on “a
' clerical person (who) was just not

thinking on a particular day.“

of the fact.’ there are actually two
kinds of cocaine available in the
world; and one of those kinds is

perfectly legal under.Virginia and‘

Federal law.

The illegal coke is the powdered
extract from the coca leaf. and is
widely sold in the United States. The
legal type. however. is something
very similar known as “snythetic
cocaine." and does not contain any
coca extracts.

Horan went to court last week,
prepared to prosecute a man for
possessing two plastic baggies of the
coke-like durg. He was immediately
challenged. however. to prove that
the buggies contained the illegal kind
of coke.

The drug has since been sent back
to the lab for further analysis.

there's a problem with the new cun-

BACK AGAIN

A new study has given additional
support to the belief that some per-
sons who have a close brush with
death have some kind of “life after
life“ experience.

Doctor MichaelSabom of the Un-
iversity of Florida in Gainesvitle
reports that he studied 67 patients
who survived near-fatal episodes, 43
of them from heart attacks. Of the
67. 38 reported some out-of-body
experience. the doctor says.

Eleven said they experienced
viewing their own bodies from
several feet in the air as doctors tried
frantically to resuscitate them. Nine-
teen others reported passing into
what thye described as a "foreign
region or dimension.“ Nine patients
reported both experiences.

None of them spoke of the ex-
perience us being unpleasant or
scary. Instead Sabom says. they
usually described going through an
initial period of darkness before
entering a brightly lit space “of great
beauty or calm and peace.“ Often
they said they met dead relatives or
friends there. " "

Dr. Sabom added that, in his
words. “somehow the message was
conveyed that it was not th'eirtiméto
be there; it was necessary for them to
return."
