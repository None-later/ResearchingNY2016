ince punk rock was
'_ introduced into the United
States there has been an
increasing growth of

completely untalented bands
who have adopted punkish names in

,hopes of cashing in on the fad.

Fortunately there are some bands being
formed who have true talent and are
trying to break into the music scene by
displaying punk attitudes in their songs.
Hounds is in this group, and the release of
their album, aptly titled Unleashed, is
proof enough that they should not be
considered as just another punk rock
band playing the same chords in each
song and running around vomitting on
people.

Hounds may be the first group to

introduce a'successful'fusion of- punk: 

Their'vmu'sic is punkish in' that the'songs
deal with such diverse topics as the love
life of a masochist, drugs, and dead
people. What constitutes the heavy metal
aspect of their music is that, unlike most

example, epitomizes the boredom
encountered. by many people which
eventually leads to getting high as a
means of escape. How can anyone of that

~ evil, heathenistic drug culture not relate

to words like “The capsules and the
powders and the least things you do, they
give you all the dreams you seldom had...
Can you resist the ever present nagging
temptation. Will this be another
Drugland Weekend?"

“Love Me, Shove Me“ deals with a girl
named Kitty who is heavily into
sadomasochism and is a nymphomaniac
of the highest degree. "The Alleys Of
Love“ is a cut telling the story of a horny
teen—age girl looking to fulfill her sexual
desires. “She doesn't care about birth
control/ She never worries cause she isn't
that old.“ Other cuts on the album worthy
of mention include “When the Boppcrs
Turn to Rockers," “Bad Blood Between
Us," and “Portrait of a Dead Man."

Taken as a whole, “Unleashed” is
definitely a great party album with some
great guitar solos and some very fine bass

“Love II the stun"
Lifertmg .12 15280
Henry Grou
By DENNIS SCHEYER
ince Henry Gross left Sha Na
Na to go solo in I970 he has
put out some excellent music.
His first two solo albums on A
& M featured some notable
tunes, but were not commercial successes.
In 1975 he joined Terry Cashmen and
Tommy West's Lifesong Records.
Cashmen and West have a reputation for
making superstars, Jim Croce among
others.

Gross's first album on Lifcsong
featured a gonzo hit "Shannon," about
Henry‘s dog. "Springtime Mama“ also on
that album was closer to the Beach Boys
than even Brian Wilson could concoct. In
other words, Gross emulates other artists

 

This is the case with Gross's latest
release, “Love is The Stuff.“ “Rock and
Roll I Love You“ features more of those
Beach Boy harmonies (Almost Eric
Carmen). Essentially, it is the usual kudos
to rock and roll for putting him where he
is today.

The title track features lyrics like, “ 1
come to your heart but there's nobody
home, love is the stuff dreams are made
of." The melody is about as simple. But
don't get me wrong, this is great summer
music. l'd definitely like to listen to this
album while lying on the beach on Fire
Island, at night, with a friend.

Side two is notquite as good,but it has
some merit. “Where the Blue Begins“ is
the “Shannon” of the album. It is mellow
and sad. I don‘t think it belongs in this

lcollection, Henry!

“Creeping Jenny" is a funky number
with fine bass by session musician Will
Lee. The lyrics are almost funnier than
the aforementioned ode to Henry's dog:
“With the Spanish Moss hanging lord.
the setting was romantic. And so we made
love. in that shady wicker wonderland."
Hmmm.

“Happiness is Still Homemade" isjust
plain pretty. it ends the album on an up
note which i think was Henry's purpose
anyway.

There is no standout feature on this
album. except that it is fun to listen to. it
follows Uross‘s trademark: it is slick, but

In. Km

 

By PETER HOFFMAN

n the ﬁve or so years since Kris

Kristofferson has become a

movie star, his albums have

been very infrequent. In fact,

only two have been released.
One was of original material entitled
“Surreal Thing," which was rather
uninspired and “Songs of Kristofferson,"
a greatest hits compilation.

“Easter island," Kristofferson‘s newest
album. brings into focus both his best and
worst characteristics as a recording artist.
Lyrically, very few songwriters can
compare to Kristofferson. He is one ofthe
few who can create vivid images with his
lyrics. His major drawback is his lack of
vocal ability. His voice is too gravelly, and
it sounds strained throughout the album.
Many of the songs themselves. though.
are among the best he has ever written.

The best cut on the album, "The Sabre
and the Rose“ is another of
Kristofferson's story songs. much in the
same vein as his “The Pilgrim.“ In this
sting, it seems that he has put both of his

crafts. acting and writing, togther. lt 

like a movie with characterizations and
settings, about a love affair in an outlaw
town. it is most reminiscent of Bob
Dylan‘s “Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of
Hearts."

“Spooky Lady‘s Revenge." which
follows. is a sequel to Kristofferson's
earlier effort, “Spooky Lady‘s Sideshow.“
It is about a woman who has taken
revenge against all of the men who have
hurt her by becoming hard and cold:
“She‘s hard in the heart like a diamond-
Flashin' ﬁre-cold as ice." The song has a
catch in the chorus and a build up which
makes it the most obvious choice for a
single.

The title cut does the most harm to
Kristofferson‘s credibilty as a singer. It
starts off sounding like a dirge sung in an
almost monotone and evolves into a
hymn to the mysterious gods of Easter
Island.

“The Fighter" and “Living Legend" are
the last two cuts on the album and
together they evoke Kristofferson‘s true
feelings about his career.

"The thtcr" is about the struggle a
songwriter goes from a time when his
songs are not heard to the eventual
success he reaches. It is a paean to
Kristoflerson himself as well as to his
"outla\\“ triends. Waylon Jennings.
Willie Nelson. and Billy Jo Shaver. “We
measured the space between Waylon and
Willie. and Willie. and Waylon and me.
But there was nothing like Billy Jo
Shaver...“ “Living Legend“ has
Kristofferson reminiscing whether all of
his accomplishments were worth the
fight.

These two songs are a perfect ending to
an album which should reestablish the
talents of one of our most important
songwriters.

‘ Montgomery’s

Revenge

By G. PASCAL ZACHARY
ames Montgomery spit out
the lyrics in a raucous white
trash accent while his Boston
based band played a mixture
of rock and roll. boogie, and

blues to a crowded Lampost.

Exuding an "i don't give a fuck"
attitude the band, consisting of a key
board, bass, guitar, and drums,
transformed the crowd into a bunch of
ﬂailing, screaming, and gyrating rock and
rollers. Montgomery played harmonica
and exhorted Albany‘s “hard core party-
ers" to dance, promising them more
music should they leave their seats en
masse and "lossen up."

The guitarist, who performed superbly,
wore sunglasses and a marine style
haircv't. He handled his instrument no
"lint: deftly than he would a World War
I \ machine gun. During one frenzied

rendition he looped past the dancers and
drew alongside the seated.

Montgomery‘s best number of the
night was 'Slcppin‘ Out High‘. a boogie
tune. James sang and played harmonica
between bits of jaded commentary on
American manners. His most authentic
utterance: "Style IS when you wake up in
the morning and you don't know what
you did last night."

J.M.'s got style. Plenty of it. His cool
was somewhat diminished when a
technical difficulty interrupted the first
sct‘s only blues number; James raced to
the rear of the club, almost bowling me
over (with no apology), and returned with
a long cable.

i didn‘t begrudge Montgomery that
slight indisgression. l was sure that when
he woke up the next morning he wouldn't
remember a thing he‘d done the night

before.
