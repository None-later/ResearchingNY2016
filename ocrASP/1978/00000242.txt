 Softball L‘Tearn

Has Been Inconsistent

by Rich Saloon . ,

“One game our ﬁelding is great
and we can‘t hit, and the next game
we get the hits and can't ﬁeld.” said

pitcher Marilyn Hinden, who also,

plays ﬁrst base for the l-3 Albany
State women‘s softball team.

That description by Hinden has
been the story of the Danes‘ season
in their ﬁrst four contests. A week
“a Tuesday. Albany whltlopped
Union I34. A week later. the women

were given a similar heating — a l9-9
loss to RPI.

Against RPl, Hinden retired their
hitters in order in the ﬁrst inning.
Then things went downhill, and fast.

Nineteen runs were scored in the .

next three innings. due to ﬁve walks
and l5 unearned runs. The latter was
the result of l4 errors.

There were some bright spots for
Albany. hitting-wise. Jeanice
Koronowski had two hits and four

This is no time
to feel insecure

if you're going to make
the most of this excit-
ing day, self-confidence
is important. And Tampax
tampons can really help.

They’re uniquely comfort-
able. In fact, once a
Tarnan tampon is properly
in place, you can't even
feel it.

And you never have to
worry about odor. Because
when a tampon is
in use, embarrassing odor
doesn't form. (Which is
why Tampax tampons don’t
offer you a deodorant —
and the added expense
that goes with it.)

What's more, Tampax
tampons are designed to
conform to individual
body contours. So
there’s less chance of
an accident.

Tampax tampons. Because
there’ll never be another
day quite like today.

Mirabella was the next batter, and
