‘  Challenge OfPerimeter Road

by Paul Setswsm.
“Going runninng
.. ya" 
“Gonna run 'the road'?"
"Gonna 'try. "

SPORT? FEATURG

The road. More speciﬁcally.
Perimeter Road. No one is sure
exactly how far it stretches around.
The accepted distance is three miles.
For those who have run it. it's not
an exact measurement. It‘s a
feeling. physical and emotional.

Pre-run. You look at your two
companions. They are both
stretching. readying themselves. You
ﬁgure you should stretch also.
Standing up. knees locked, you
touch the ground with your hand. A
sharp pain shoots up the back of
your thigh. The other two saythey‘re
ready. You‘re not sure you are. but
you nod anyway.

The run. The early pace is
incredibly slow. You want to speed
up, but your companions caution
against it. They have both run the

road once before. This is your ﬁrst
time. The pace stays slow. '

It turned out to be a beautiful day.
Actually, it's a cliche day; sunny.
breezy and mild. Running three
abreast. you approach the ﬁrst
plateau. The trees that lined the road
at the outset are gone; in their place
are the empty athletic ﬁelds. You spot
a jogger coming from the opposite
direction. He is moving
embarrassingly faster than you are.
As he passes, he gives the "thumbs
up” gesture. It's your ﬁrst taste of the
comraderie that runners share.

Small aches and pains begin to
inﬁltrate your body. A slight cramp
starts to form under your right
ribcage. a cutting twinge that comes
and goes. Your lungs cannot get
enough air in them. For the ﬁrst
time. you notice the sounds. The
three of you sound like a symphony
of wheezes and gasps. alternating the
lead roles.

The run is now slightly uphill.
Your legs. which are beginning to
throb. have to work a bit harder up
the incline. ln siﬁl is the second

Inspiration.

"Halfway done. ”

' “Nope, not yet."

Your shoulders sag. Your
inspiration is gone. All this pain. and
not even hallway. You entertain a
new idea; quitting. You glance at
your companions, there is no sign of
faltering. Sighing, you continue on.

A conversation starts. something
about health and conditoning. You
hear the words, but they do not
register. There‘s a war going on
between your mind and your body.
Every movement becomes
conscious. Your legs pumping, your
arms churning. the lungs aching.
Even on this cool day. your shirt is
drenched. Sweat drops down on
your glasses, but you don't botherto
wipe it off. As total despair starts to
set in. the news: The final plateau is
approaching.
