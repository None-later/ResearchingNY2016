Doing well is one thing. but Plantier‘s assault on the record book

Plantier came up with the bases loaded. His thoughts were not of

Few players have the‘luxury of analyzing which one oftheir hits ina

A late surge carried the Albany
State track and ﬁeld squad to an 85-
69 victory over Oswego on Monday.
stretching the team's win streak to
five straight.

The Great Danes have never lost
to Oswego. although most of their
clashes have been tough ones. This
one was no exception. “We were
thinking we could win it without too
much trouble. but I'm always a little
afraid of Oswego." said Albany
coach Bob Munsey.

After the ﬁrst eight events were
completed. Albany trailed 49-20.
The team did not take the lead until
after the Mth of l8 scheduled events
had been completed. Munsey said.
“It was a hairy sonuvagun.”

taking first and second places. Jim
Cunningham won the event. his ﬁrst
top finish ofhis collegiate career. He
also took a third in the higlt jump
and a third in the javelin. Erik
Shultz. the second-place finisher in
the intermediate hurdles. also took a
third place in the 440.

The big event of the day for
Albany was the three-mile run. it
was a sweep for the team. with Mark
Lavan. Ed Von Bevern and Bill
Mathis finishing first. second and
third. respectively.

The mile 'relay team turned in the
fastest time for an Albany State team
in four years. a 14:26.6. The teameon-

retaliated immediately. when John
DeGregory smacked a Mark

ball landing on Perimeter Road.

visiting Middlebury staged their
version of a matathon. In a nine

hours to complete. the finish was too
close to call. The outcome was a 6-6
tie. called for a lack ofdaylight left.

Some productive action oc-
curred in the second inning. The
Danes have gotten into the habit of
hitting home runs this spring in
many of their games. Sticking to
tradition. Paul Nelson cracked a
booming shot with a man on second
that just cleared the fence in right
field.

“i struck outthe first time up. but I
knew I could hit the pitcher because
he wasn't that fast." stated Nelson. “1
was trying to hit a line drive up the
middle. but he gave me a nice pitch
to hit. an inside fastball. It's nice to
get one out.“

Pitching with n J-l lead. Albany

How strong is the Albany State
varsity tennis team?

The answer to this question is
becoming readily apparent as the
spring season progresses. Although
it is still questionable as to whether
the Danes are at the level of their
Division I opponents. it is now ob-
vious that they are much too power-
fulfor most oftheir Division ll | foes.

They proved this once again. as
they defeated Rl’l on the road Tues-
day. S-l.

The match was highlighted by the
return to winning form of Albany‘s
number—one player. l’aul lieldman.
After losing twu straight matches
against Division I opponents. Feld-
man rebounded against Rl’l by
defeating Tom Savchik in identical
6-3 sets.

Feldmon indicated that he was
very pleased to he the winner after
suffering two heartbreaking defeats

sophomores.

It was also a great day for (:0-
cttptain Mark Dalton. Dalton took
both the 880 and the mile. Lavan
took il second In the first mile of his
collegiate career. in addition to his
victory in the threc'mile run.

Munsey run many of his men in
events that were strange to them. He
explained. “We had moved a lot of
our men to different events. to get
thetn out ol their rut.“ He indicated
that the team tends to go stale ifthey
run the same event meet after meet.

The Danes now have a big meet to
look forward to against Cortland. a
team that nosed out the Danes by
four points last season. Cortland is a
tough squad this season. as well. The
home meet will take place this Satur-
day at 2 pm.
