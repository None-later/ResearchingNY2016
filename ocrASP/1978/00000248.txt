survival rate of recombinant
bacteria should it manage to leak.
Even if certain techniques of ex-
perimentation were used sloppily.
Holmes said. the rate is incredibly
small. The suwival of such bacteria
would be hampered by. among other
things. enzymes which inhibit their
growth, Holmes said.

Holmes has himself been agenctic
layman having studied geology as an
undergraduate with few courses in
biology. After his second year at
Trinity College in Dublin. he realiz-
ed that he related best to logic. and
that straighbforward memorization
was not easy for him. His study of
genetics began soon after. Holmcs
ﬁrst posed for himself the question
of what controls genes in l969 at the
California Institute of Technology.
under the guidance of molecular
geneticist and plant physiologist
.Iamcs Bonner. in the same school
liolmts did post-doctoral research
in the Chemistry Department under
Norman Davison. Rcsctttch thcrc
centered around large proteins
known as Histoncs ~ particles
which are loosely bound to the two
strands of the DNA helix.

Today, Holmes says he considers
himself a “gene bchaviorologiat."
