MAKIN’ MUSIC

Saxophone player Paul Winter is
claiming to be the first person to
have actually recorded a musical
duet with a wild wolf.

Winter recently ventured into the
wilds near Wolf Park. Indiana. and
began serenading a pack of wolves.
According to the musician‘s agent. a
she-wolf then began howling long
into the night. performing a duct
with winter.

Purdue University Professor
Erich ‘Klinghanimcr says that this
jam session in the wilds hits scrioUs
scientific implications.
Klingliamnicr states: “For four
nights after winter left. we heard the
wolf with wliorii he had been playing
howling in a manner that had been
distinctly influenced by the tune
winter had played.“ According to the
professor: “it was probably the first
known observation of imitative
bahavior in wolf-call patterns."

llie recorded duet. incidentally.
will be included as a ctlt on wintcr‘s
up~coming album “Wolf lzyes."

’MMM GOOD

A team of five Yale University
medical researchers is out with a
rather unorthodox report. The five
doctors say they have found that
cocaine users might be able to get
higher by ingesting or eating their
stash. instead of sniffing it.

The doctors. writing in Science
Magazine. report they conducted a
series of studies on four volunteer
coke users who had previously used
the white powdery drtrg for
“recreational purposes."

llte doctors write that on sortie oc—
casions the volunteers were given
cocaine orally. and on other oc-
casions “iritrrr-nasally." In both in-
sirrnccs. according to iltc report. the
amount ol "coke" administered was
identical. _

The doctors suggest that while it
might be more efﬁcient to take
cocaine orally. not snifﬁng cocaine
may dampen the enthusiasm for, in
their words. “it's golden spoons.

LOVE HANGOVER

True love is shth and sweet.
usually lasting 14 lo 15 months.

This is according to California
State Polytechnic University
l'rofessor F] B] Meeker. 'I'hc
peofcssor‘s interest in love is not
cynical, but scientific. He says he
studied the love affairs of |05 men
and women rangingin age from lilto
43 whose romances had recently
ended.

Meeker told the Western l’sy-
chological Assoc-ration at its annual
conference in San l'raiicrsco that the
median durabiliton a romrrntic cri-
ianglcmcnt. including the intense
chapter was about l5 months.

[he professor said that the
chances of at "‘sttcaty painted"

about 50-50. hilt that ‘l-l |lt‘lt‘L‘lil of
