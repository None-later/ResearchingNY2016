 Bruce Oliver. associate
professor of accounting, used to play
squash. but has switched to racquet-
ball "because'it's hard to find squash
partners.“ He assesses racquetball to
be a‘ good social game and enjoys
playing doubles with both faculty
members and students.

Oliver believes other advantages
to the sport are "the heavy workout
in it short period oftimc and the low
cost of equipment." Hc has'lcurned

"just got knocked out" when he wns

‘Donna Corell has seen the
shrinkage. “Although we've recently
received shipments with some dcfec~

problem has been with the people
who take out equipment, but don‘t
return it. And, of course. the (rec-
