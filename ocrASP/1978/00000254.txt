by Rlch Sellgson

In Saturday‘s Albany State~
Russell Sage \vorrieri’s softball game.
a 20-6 victory by Russell Sage.
something unusual and comical
happened only one Dane player
started at their usual position.
pitclicr Nancy Sapio. Ilieabseiicc ol
starting catcher KttrcriU‘Rcilly. who
“as participating til it volleyball
tourriariicnt. triggered the L‘IliIIII ol
changes.

played catcher bclor‘c. clinic in lrorii
her shortstop position in place ol
()‘Rcilly. Ihcri. last year's third
baseman Jill Slcr‘rt rcplrtccd Dc Vito.
leaving her CCIIlCl‘llCItI spot opcn.
('iridy Werner moved over toeeritcr.
and liclorc all the r'c-positionirig by
Albany coach Ms, |.cc Rlienisli thh
«HL'I'. eight players were ill dillcr’cnt
places lrorn where they have been
this season.

"I Illllll\ II “as essential." stud

Rhcnisli. “You use people where
they're needed. I felt as it team we
plriycd better than in the Union game
(an ll-ll) victory by Albany) ill
terms of positioning."

Despite all the switching. nothing
couid stop the bills of Russell Sage. a
perennial lorig~ball hitting club.
"Anywhere where there was a hole.
they were placing them. We never
came close." said Albany second
baseman Marilyn lliridcri. A l9-liit
attack sparked Albany‘s opponents.
who have only one loss onthc season.

Russell Sage pitcher Rosie Case
kept the Danes‘ hats quiet. allowing
only seven hits. “She was the lastest
pitcher we have ever collie up
against.“ said I'IlIlLIL‘lI. “She was a
wrndriiill pitcher with .trna/irig ac-
curacy."

.lcarircc Kororiowskr and Cindy
Werner drove in two runs lipiccc to
lead the Uttrics‘sparse littttngtlttttck.
Kororiowski is tltc only Albany

batter hitting over .500 through six
games.

After the one-sided loss. Albany‘s
record stands at 2-4. with both of
their wins against Union In Friday's
home game. the women squeezed
ottt an ll-IU victory. in comparison
with their l3~4 triumph over Union
earlier this season.

Sapio pitched all seven innings.
allowing only two walks. “She was
successful the last time against Uri-
iori." said Rhenisli. “If she could do
it once. she could do it again.“

After six innings. the score was [0-
l(I. Sapio littd no trouble in the
seventh and liriril inning. getting Un-
ion's hitters to pop otit three times.
In the Danes" hall of the seventh,
UcVito led all with a single. I'licn.
Union‘s pitcher lost her coritrnl and
walked the game away. its three cort-
secutive base-ori-hrills brought in the
winning run.
