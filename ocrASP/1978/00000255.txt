frustrated.

Ken Gorman. whose two goals for
the Danes were his finest effort this
year. led an Albany comeback with
leading scorer Dan" Goggin. The
Danes surged to a 7-3 lead with three
minutes left iii the half.

Relaited Defense

But. as has happened all year. the
Danes relaxed on defense. "Wcjust
got beat one-oit-onc." said Albany
coach Mike Mottafllartwick netted
two goals and the score at halftime
was 7-5.

 

 

 

After regrouping. the Danes open-
ed the third period by allowing yet
another goal. But Goggin ﬁred in it
overhead blast from the right side.
increasing Albany‘s lead to two
goals. which they never lost.

Motta had praise for his mid-
fielders. “Five of the first six iiiiddies
scored. we did a real good job off-
siveiy.“ However. Motta felt the
defense was too aggressive. “They
never should have gotten eight
goals.“

Albany‘s next game is Saturday
against Siena at 3:30 I’.M.
