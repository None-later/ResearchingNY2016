“All of us were in the groove
yesterday. everything clicked." this
was how coach Bob MUnsey of the
Albany State track and field team
described his squad's surprising 93-
70 triumph over track powerhouse
Cortland last Saturday.

The victory was easily the team‘s
biggest of 'the year. Cortland had
won eight regular season meets this
year and had won the Colgate In-
vitational Tournament. The 7-I
Danes had their own win streak of
Five meets on the line as well.

Lou Robin got the Danes ofl'to a
good start. taking the Itamrner
throw. I-reshnian Allan liokser ttiok
third in the hammer. wlticli was to be
one of only two field evetits that
Albany took all day.

Cortland is traditionally strong in
the licld events. In last year‘s \ersion
til this meet. the Dam. took only
tour at the 72 poitits a varded for

Albany coach liob Lewis. 'Ihey

and at that point we couldn't
reschedule the match."

Albany sewed up the match early
as they took their top live singles
matches. Massachusetts was lorccd
to move each of their singles players
up three notches. “It would have
been a very competitive match had

Lewis.
