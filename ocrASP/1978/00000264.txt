RE Speedwagon
By PETER N. 560 URIS

E0 Specdwagon has been on

the national rock scene for

abotit five years and have had

a few moderate Ll’ successes.

'l hey began as a young group
of raunchy rock and rollers but have since
refined their style and technique. l‘heir
latest release. You can lime a Piano, “it!
lull ('un't 'l'tmu Fir/t. is a total group
effort. right down to the songwriting and
production. It is Specdwagon‘s strongest
effort to date. and could very well gain
them the additional recognition tltey need
for tiny tnajor successes in Ll’ stiles and
tours.

One highlight ol luu (‘un’l lllllt' a

l‘imm is " Roll With the Changes." a fairly
sensational. catchy pop ttlne. While this
ctlt is rather ottt of character compared
with previous Speedwagon efforts. it does
have the potential for their first major
AM hit.
A similar pop flavor is found in both
" lime for Me to l‘ly"and“l)o \ oti Know
Where Your Woman ls lonight‘P‘. lhe
latter also can be regarded as "hit"
material. lhe formula tot'these selections
is similar to that ol lloston pop-
oriented melodies within an intensive
rock framework,

But R lit) Speedwagon hasn‘t neglected
their original style. lltc album also
contains its share of heavy-duty rock and
roll. ()nc listen Lo "Runnin‘ Blind" or
“Lucky l‘or You." and you'll see that
RH) can still rock withtlie best oftbem,

for powerful rock with a popular
Ilavor. R lit) Speedwagon‘s latest offering
is one of the best so far this year. lhc
performance is energetic. yet controlled.

lbc rcsttlt is a quality pop. rock albliin. a
definite plus for |{l;() Speetlwagon.

"Elevator"
lz'pit- “515074
Ruuoll Duhlelt

 

By PETER N. SGOURIS
mong the numerous rock and
roll acts entering the arena for
the first time this year. Russel
DuShiell stands out as one of
the most promising artists of

 

Ll978. This is due to a number of factors,

all of which combine to make Elevator, .

his new Ll’. an extremely attractive and,
listcnable rock album.

One of DaShicll‘s distinctive abilities
concerns his Use ofseveraf types ofguitars
— electric, acoustic. and slide. His guitar
work is both clever and versatile, and
tends to hold thearrangernentstogether.

Another important factor lies itt
DaShiell‘s songwriting abilities. His
short. concise compositions are generally
melodic attd flavory. llicy stand up to
repeated listenings. "Electrical Wave of
Sound." "lit the Fire." and "Oh My Wild
Love“ are just a few worth mentioning.

llut RUssel DaShiell's tnosl appealing
characteristic lies in his roots. DaSbiell is
a child of the sixties. and his music
contains the influences of several major
sixties rock performers. In it sense.
lJaShicll is a sixties rock aiid roll
revivalist. incorporating the styles of
major rock performers of the sixties from
a tnore objective perspective.

DaShiell‘s greatest influence was
probably the Beatles. Such tunes as " top
of the World“ and "501h Century" clearly
demonstrate a Beatles approach to
melody. harmony. ‘vocalization. and
instrumentation. llie influences of such
other sixties greats such as Hendrix. the
Who. the Stones. and Clapton are also
present in thealbum. lhese influences are
not always obvious; usually several styles
are fused together. I he general approach
to all tracks is reminiscent of the sixties
eithanced. of course. by modertt studio
techniques. lhis gives lilt'vttlor an
attractive familiarity to fans of sixties
rock which is a rather large record—buying
group.

.\ guitarist. a songwriter. and a
memory. What are the results of these
lttclot's'.’ An original entertaining album.
HaShieIl‘s Il/l‘l'tllf)!’ is worth a listen. He
seems like a musician with potential.
perhaps the potential to set the pace for
the eighties. a decade of sixties revival.

ichacl Murphey is another
member of that group of
talented tnusicians iii a
category .known as “one top

A forty ltit single. all other
material ignored."
'1 he top forty single was the dynamic
"Wildfire" which went gold hack in I975.
lhe album from which it was taken “Blue
Sky Night 'I bustier“ sold well. bill was
basically ignored. the followup single
"Renegade" was a six minute
masterpiece. but only Murphey‘s cult
following, and music bi]. followers gave it
more than 21 “Geo it‘s good. btit it‘s too
long to be a bit." So. lipic put ottt a short
version and it hit a high of N50 on
Billboard.
Michael Murphey. hoWever keeps

 

putting out excellent albums. "Lonewolt"

 

is‘ expressed by’ Murphey’in the liner
notes on the buck ofrthe album: “One
night you willsec yourself. the outline ofa
lone wolfagainst the frozen golden moon.
You will feel winter is your prey. Circling
something. slowly circling in the dark.
you will begin to sing.“

Murphey's voice has an edge not
dissimilar to Todd Rundgrcn. He sings
about love gone bad. animals. loneliness
and paradise.

“Nothing is Your Own" features a
punching horn section. funky guitars. atid
a sort of an Atlantic Rhythm Section
sound.

lyrics are straight ottt of the Willie Nelson

ftcr a month's delay.
Renaissance finally tirade
their appearance at the Palace
Theatre last night. It was
more than worth the wait.

An unknown. Bill Lamb. opened the
show. He was a credible guitarist-vocalist
but his songs were cliched. Lamb told its
he had a dressing room in the basement. I
guess he was looking for sympathy. bttt he
never got it as half of the audience filed in
late wondering who the guy on stage was.

“Southern California lllttes" sounded
like its title. it prompted my friend to say
“there‘s so much you can do with a guitar
ttnd he isn't doing any of it!" Only a song
which Lamb wrote for Randy Meisner.
“Daughter of the Sky." was worthy of
notice. Lamb said that next time he would
come back with a band. He has a good
voice. but he must develop a more
convincing style arid repertoire.

After it short intermission. John Miles
appeared on the stage. He began his all
too brief performance with “Hottest Matt
Jack" form his new release “Zaragon.”
Miles on keyboard and electric guitar was
in fine form. A rocking version of
"lligltfly" captured the interest of an
unsure audience.

"on the Borderline" featured the
talkbox that Miles first introduced on
"Slowdown." it was a typical Miles piece.
bttt extremer enjoyable.

Next came "Laragon" which. for those
of you who weren‘t there. is about how a
woman contracts a social disease while oti
42nd Street. 'I he combination of Miles
keyboard work. llob Marshall's
synthesizer and bass and Barry llltles
percussion made the piece exciting.

"No Hard Feelings" sounded a lot like
“Remember Yesterday.“ It‘s a love sottg
that was pretty without getting sappy.
iles concluded the set with
"Slowdown" from “Stranger in the City."
In this performance the girls' chorus was
missing. but the rocker had everyone in
the audience moving. The lights went on.

 

is no exception. The impetus for the title t

no chance for the audience to request an

Worth the Wait

fact. it might even be Murphey's sacrum

hit single.‘

Mttrphey is backed on “Lonewolf” by
some fine scssioti musicians including Jai
Winding on acoustic guitar. Sum
Broussard on Electric guitar. Bob Glaub
on bass and Mike Botfs on drums.

M urphey enjoys making mtlsic. When I
saw ltini in tltc half-horse town on
Woodbttrne. New York. in a 300 seat
hole-in-thc-wall they called a theatre.
only 50 people showed up for his second
show. lhis was when "Wildfire" was in
the top 20. He told the audience for the
first sltow to stay and party for the rest of
the night. When asked why he played the
gig in the first place, Murphey said "It
seemed like a fun place."

"Lonewoll“ probably won‘t make
Michael Murphey rich. but he knows it‘s
a good album. and I think that's all that
really matters.

encore: a poor move on sotncone's partlf

Next was “Carpet of the Sun." a trite
audience pleaser. In fact. the audience
was so pleased that they showed ait
unusual a mo tint of enthusiasm
throughout the show.

" l hinking About lhings" lrom " turn

solo by John lottt and excellent guitar
work by Michael Dunlord attd Joli

to "Prologue." lhis was the type ofsliow
that the audience expected from

classy.

enthusiasm amusing. She asked the
audience if they were smiling. She has at.
incredible laugh, lheti cattle a litre
\ersion ol "Midas Man" which ended
with a glass breaking hiin tiote by Annie.
Her voice can only be described as
angelic.

"Northern Lights“ from "Song for All

excellent tlrtttn work by lercnce Sullivan.
l hey lltett ditl "Songlor AllSeasons" and
left the stage.

()t course the audience brought them
back for an encore. which much to this
rcvicwct"s‘ pleasure was it rocking version
of the classic "l’rologtte." Ihe sound was
superior and appeared to be mixed iii
stereo.

Congrats to U.C.ll., Renaissance. and
John Miles who brought myself and all
who were there an enjoyable evening. l‘o
those of you who got refunds on your
tickets. thanks. lt enabled those who
really wanted to see Renaissance to have
