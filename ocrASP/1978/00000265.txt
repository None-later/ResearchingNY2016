I would be cmbarasscd to work for a
University that felt compelled to change its

someone will want to change the second

nonsense cnd‘! And how about the second
syllable in the word woman? And surely the

worse and more of it!

senate
representation

, To the Editor:

l'his' open letter is addressed to the members
of the faculty.

on May 8, you must dccidc if student
rcPresentation on the University Senate
should pass into its second decade of
existence. We believe student participation

‘ I should not be tcrminatcd; it is worthy of yottr

.;I continued confidence and support. Strident

  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 

rcpresentation should be maintainer] on the
Senate not only because students have
Participatcil responsibly for nine years. but
also because students have a right to be
> represented in the governance structure ofthis
I Univcrsity.

That right is grounded iii the fact that
students are the largest constituency of this
niversity. and the nature of the
responsibilities with which the University

 

'belicvc that ‘tbc

Senate is empowered directly effect this‘
constituency. The rights and responsibilities
of the Senate are so extensive that, to a student
lrvrng on campus. the Univcrsiiy 50mm is me
local government. Without representation on
the Senate many students will he
disenfranchised below the statc~wide level.
Students come to this Umvcrsny with a wide
variety of dreams. expectations. and goals: we
University should be
rcsponsibe to our needs as well as to those of
the faculty. administrators. and non-teaching
professionals. I

We do not believe that the concerns of our
community can best be met by separating
faculty. administrators, and non-teaching
professionals into one legislature and the
students into another. This separation would
place a great strain on the President. Students
would be forced to approach the President on
a single question of whether or not a piece of
legislation should be signed. l'his kind of
atmosphere would have many dctrimential
cllccts: firstly. it would undermine the
l’rcsidcrit's relationship with the Senate. as a
responsive leader; secondly. it would forcctltc
l’rcsidcnt into the role of a mediator as well as
the role of art autocratic decision maker.
i‘illilll)’. both students and laculiy will loscthe
added insights of cacti otlicr's eonirricrits. l'bc
Scrinrc could no longcr be rccogriilcd as
speaking for our entire coirimunity. but only
as an advocate of sonic frictions within the
community. Over the past nine years ottr
community has proven its ability to resolve
dillcrcnccs' of opinion lit the policy formation
stages. We believe a system in which students
are not t'cptcscntcd on Seattle is an
unuart‘ttulctl waste of an important resource.

In the years that students have scrvcd tltc
Uni\crsity on the Senate, they havc provcri
tlicir ability to resolve conflict within the
governance system. Students have shown,
lllllt‘ and time again. that they are motivated
not just by a conccrti for the constituencies
that elccicd tlicm. but by a concern for the
crrtirc SUNYA community. We hate strived
to hccoriic objective in important policy
coirsidcratiorrs ultich \\lil cltcct futttre
gcncrntiorrs of students.

l'ct at the close of a ycar that has seemingly
obscured the siirirlaritics and accented tltc
dil’lcrerrccs in faculty and student interest it
may be hard to yicw students as wholly
objectnc arid unselfish. it must be
remembered. however. that we have never
veered from the one notion that has gltidcd all
ol our actions: the quality of our education is
directly contingent upon the quality of our
instructors. We have vigorously advocated the
facility‘s cause to administrator's both on and
till this campus. We have gone beyond tltisto
advocate. in the lcgislaturc. increased
resources lor the laculty of this campus.

Just as ottr work outside of this campus has
helped to make the University stronger. we
helicw ottr work on this campus has helped to
make the Senate stronger. Ilic student brings;
more than idealism and hard work to that
body. llcr’shc brings a unique perspective.
When that perspective is fully considered in
making policies for our community. we can't
help but have stronger. more effective
legislation. When this student pcrspectivc is
absent. the Scnatc‘s policies lost- legitimacy. as
they can no longer claim support throughout
the University.

In conclusion. we ask you to support our
ell’ort to retain representation on the Senate.
not solely for the good ol’studcnts now. but for
the good ol'any one of us.studentsand faculty
alike. who, at any point in their lrvcs oi‘carccrs
will carry with them an association with this
University,

Unanswered Questions

The search is over. Vince O‘Leary has been recommended for the
SUNYA presidency, yet there are many questions about the search
process which will remain unanswered. First, the committee never made
public the names of the other candidates.~ What was the caliber of these
other candidates? if it was very high, then why did the committee draft
0‘ Leary, who repeatedly stated that he did not want the job
permanently? .

lf committee members were not pleased with this secrecy, why has this
only come out after the process has been completed? Why didn’t the
S U N Y A community get a chance to question the candidates, or even the
eventual choice for president, on their perception ofthis university? By
keeping the names secret, was the committee more concerned with the
future of the candidates than with the future of SUN YA? Does the fact
that a non-declared candidate wasrecruited mean that the caliber ofthc
other candidates was less than what was expected and that this came
about because of the hard times SUNYA has bad?

'l'hese questions are ones that the SUNYA community should be told
the answers to. Unfortunately, with its CIA-like secrecy, it is unlikely
that we will ever know anything about what really went on in the
selection process.

“W”, Students and Senate

A committee of University Senate passed a new bill on the course
withdrawal policy yesterday which is clearly a compromise between
faculty and students. The bill calls for the elimination of the "W", that
negative mark which has marred many a SUNYA student’s transcript
and chances of employment or placement in grad school.

The "W" did not get erased without some sacriﬁce in return, however.
lhc bill calls for the rollback ot‘the withdrawal period from the current
fourteen weeks to one week after mid-semester.

While this is not the best thing for students, it does make the faculty
happy, which is what a compromise is all about. For faculty, it means no
longer teaching a course and having students drop out ofit at the end of
the semester. For students, it means a little adjustment, but also the
erasing oftbc  Surveys ofstudents have found that this compromise
situation would be acceptable. Hopefully, with Senate and presidential
approval, it will become policy.

in a related Senate issuo, the question of whether students should
remain on the policy-developing body comes to a faculty vote on
Monday.

Without student representation, the Senate would no longer be a truly
representative body and would lose a large amount ofintegrity. Faculty
members who will vote on this question Monday should keep that in
mind. ‘l'he vote is not only for students, it is for Senate and its future as a
viable university governing entity.
