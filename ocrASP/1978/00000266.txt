Tartan,

Down the Delaware

You said we must flow,

Promising me in the water

We wou not go.

All tltru skinriers

We did iust firte,

Taking the lead

While drinking our wine.

Many didrl't make it over

and were caused to shiver,

Cascading like chicklets

Into the river.

We found our rock

And stopped lor lunch.

What was about to happt'm.

We had no hunch.

Over the edge

bath of us rolled.

Minus preservers

Into the cold.

To our dismay

The canoe was gone,

But alas we were rescued

By Body and Ron.

Walking the tracks

Was really a bitch,

Wet and bare

Was no help for a hitch.

We pulled thru it all

My faith in you holds,

Together we'll conquer

Our virus and colds.
love, Jone

Dearest Peter -
