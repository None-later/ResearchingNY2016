‘ Intramurals: A SUNYA Success Story

continued from page sixtevn
basically. the system works.

The number of people involved in
intranturals has more than douhled
in onlysii. years. This year's total has
already surpassed the previous year, -
but according to lilkin, the major
goal of the program has not heen
reached yet.

".What's nice about running in~
tramttrals is you never have to worry
about a winning or losing season.
We‘re trying'to run a program that
llte students can enjoy and take a lit-
tle time out of the library to relax.

 

and inayhc forget abotit some of the
academic pressures oti campus. Our
goal is to get everyone in the school
involved with intriiiiiurals. lotal
participation would he tremen—
dons.“

lotal participation might be very
difficult to achieve. considering the
program's major problem. Albany
has a serious lack ol indoor athletic
facilities. 'l he gym is the only
available iaeility. and it must be
shared by phy caleduealion classes
and the Inteicollegiale teams. with
intramtnals being the third priority.

n'l lie situation ,was demonstrated
by olir basketball season," says
(ioldman. "Teams went so long
without nlayinga game that some of
them lost‘ interest. We just didn't
have the gym time. and we ltud more
forfeits because of it.“

One change that the conncil
would like to see is the creation ol'a
special intramural fee. As it stands
now. only students who pay the 333
student tax can participate in in-
tramurals. 1 his rtile lemes out many
at the 0000 graduate students. some
ol whom want to participate in in-

 

tramurals but do not wish to pay
$33.
“We approached Student
Association about the intramural
fee." commented Elkin. "and they
said if we set up a special fee for
graduate students or the many facul-
ty that would like to participate. we
would also have to offer it to the un-
dergradunte students, so they kind of
shut that idea down."

Watching an intramural game.
regardless of the sport. it is not hard
to see the "fun" aspect that is stress-
ed. However. there is competition.
sometimes very heated competition.
l’layers still curse when they miss a
shot. or scream at the unipircohout a
play at the plate.

“It‘s a lot of fun, but it‘s not exact-
ly what you would call friendly,"
says Steve Essen, whose intramural
football team won theZLeaﬁue ll‘
:httn'ipionship. “Everyone took it
ieriously. and there 'were some in-
juries. Still, everyone loved it."

"By stressing the fun aspect. I‘m
not putting deem the competitive
end." stated Elkin. “I think there has
to he a program of competition.
'l'hcrc also has to be a program for
people that arejust interested in hav-
ing a good time."

The fact is. the intramural
program offers any caliber of corn-
petitioii that an individual could
want. For Bruce Friedman. the corri-
petiliori is just right.

“We‘rejust out there to have fun.“
said Friedman. whose intramural
softball team lost their last two
games by more than 20 runs. ivcn if"
we lose. we can still joke about it
later,"

Because oi the fttn aspect. almost
every intramural sport is now also
ollered coed. According to lilkin,
this is perhaps the essence ofwhat iii-
ti’aniurals tries to be; people en-
ioving themselves.

“I wish i could give an award to
every team that ends up with a losing
season. or maybe even a team that
never ivon a game htit showed up to
every one of their games. In me.
those people (lesei'ie awards because
they understand the philosophy
behind intramurals. (in out. relax,
get some physical exercise. and tint
worry whether you “in or lose."
