SHUT 'EM UP

(icncral' Willia'm Wes‘tmorcland,
the former Commander of the US.
troops in Vietnam. is suggestingtahi
if there is another war. the press
should be censored.

Speaking before an annual con-
ference on Accuracy in Media. West-
nioreland said that the Vietnam war
was the first war t'ortght without
sortie sort of official censorship. He
added that his analysis of the ln-
doehiiia War coverage indicates that
reporters in Vietnam handled their
jobs in an irresponsible mariner.

Westmorcland said Vietnam
reporters "tended to becoriie
abusive. arrogant and
hypocritical. . . smug and ex-
cessively sensitive." He added that
the media was masterfully
manipulated" by pi'optigaiida lrtiiit
Hanoi and Moscow.

Westriiorcland said he lavoi's a
tree press and docs not solely blame
the media for the collapse ol Saigon.
He added. however. that in future
oars. "a policy slioilhl be riiadc to
protect the interest ol bolli tlic mcdra
and goteriimeiit" to a\oitl ItItiIrc
press problems. Westriiorcland add-
ed talit "l thing censorship could be
imposed. . . and north] be sup-
ported."

lhe suit was filed on behalf of
Iom Hansen against his parents.
Richard and Shirley Hansen. at a
District Court in Boulder, Colorado.
It charges that 'lom Hansen will
need psychiatric care for the rest of
his life because of the treatment he
received in childhood. Hansen
claims he was neglected. under-
nourished. humilirtted and forced to
work at the age of 14.

Hansen‘s attorney. John Iaussig.

MOVE OVER

A Chicago sleep researcher says
that husbands rind w' liotild oc-
casiorially take separate vacations so
that the wife cart ciitcli tip on her
sleep.

Doctor Roslind Cartwright of
Rtish-Presbyterian-Sr, Luke's
Medical (enter in Chicago reports
that espeririiciits in her sleep
laboratory have tottrid that most
husbands sleep iii ways which pre-
vent their wives l‘roni obtaining ride-
quate rest.

The Doctor says that when
married couples sleep together. the
men almost always get proper
amounts of “delta sleep" or seep
sleep: however. she adds. wives often
are distrtibed by the nialc‘s tossing
and turning and other nocturnal
habits. tttid don't get enough “delta
sleep."

in catch up. says Doctor
Cartwright. wives should make a
point of sleeping along from tiriic to
time.
