Find a school. settle down "
If you want. you can be pie-med,

Look at me, I‘m old and We got money.

I was once an undergrad and i know it can be easy.
So stay calm and ask around for a gut course.
Take you; time, cheat a lot,

Take every easy course they've got

For you'll be in med school tomorrow

But today you're not.

Doctor: lt‘sunottinie~ to make a transfer.

Just sit down ~mid take it slowly, .
You‘re at a_ suite school and it‘s cheap.
There's so much 1 have to pay for
Take your boards, dodge alot

Take the easiest’major they‘ve got.
Look at me I 'got‘thru and I made it.
