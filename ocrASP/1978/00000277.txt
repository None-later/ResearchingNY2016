Billy Backus Pursues Lost Glory

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AI’) km the
past eight years Billy Backus Iias
been pursuing the glory that was his
for so short a time when he was the
welterweight boxing champion of
the world.

Now the 35-year-old father of
three children has his last chance to
regain a world title later this month
when he faces Jose I’ipino L'uevas.

If Backus wins. he says he will
regain his youth. He will also be
duplicating a feat performed by his
famous uncle. Carmen Basilio. the
world welterweight and
middleweight champion of the
I950‘s.

probably be the end of his career.

"I don‘t think there would be
much for me to do afterwards. if I
don‘t grab the title. At my age I
couldn‘t enjoy the gamcjust struggl-
ing along. picking tip $3.000 or $4;
000a fight. It‘s a damn long way up
that ladder.“ Backus said Monday.

Backus did not make any money
for his labors in I970 when he beat
Jose Napolcs here to claim the world
title. All the money had to be turned
over to Napoles to lure the champion
into the city where Backus has been a

Possible Shakeup Ahead
For Troubled Knicks

NEW YORK (AP) The New York
Knicks won 43 games this season.
finished second in their division and
made the National Basketball
Association playoffs for the first
time in three years. They beat
Cleveland in the first round. then
were swept in the second round by
Philadelphia. the team that is
favored to go all the way. They were
still playing when l4 other clubs
were watching on television.

All in all. not a bad season. right?

So why is cveryone'waitiiigf'or the
ax to fall? Why do the local papers
keep saying that Coach Willis Reed‘s
job is in jeopardy. that the Nets'
Kevin Loughcry is being eyed as
Reed's replacement?

And why is starting gtiard Butch
Beard. among others. predicting
wholesale changes'.’ “A major
shakeup.“ he expects. “You may
only see two or three of us back next
year.“

The answer is Sonny Werblin. the
man who arrived in midscason as the
top executive of Madison Square
Garden. He is the boss man. the one
who will make all the big decisions.
and he‘s making sure everyone in the
Knicks‘ orgiiniriition including
Reed. president Mike Burke and
(icncral Manager Iiddic Donovan

- knows it.

When Reed. earlier this month.

Knicks‘ best interest. he was shot
down by Werblin. “Mr. Reed will
handle the coaching." the boss said
icily. “Eddie. Mike and I will make
the decisions on personnel."

Through all the speculation about
Reed being fired. Werblin has
remained mum. All lie says is that he
will sit down with Burke. Donovan
and Reed “in a round—table discus-
sion and decide where we‘re going.“
It is eminently clear who will make
the final decision.

Three of the four people sitting
around that table want Reed back
as coach next season. "I enjoy
coaching. said Rccd alter the com-
pletion of his first season. “I assume
I'll be back next year: I‘d like to.“

Strong Support

He has the strong support of both
Burke and Donovan. but Werblin
is the man whose vote counts. and lie
has yet to hack Reed.

In any case. Werblin is a man of
action. his $400,000 signing of .Ioc
