Special Senate Meeting Called

by Matthew (fox

A special meeting ol the Universi-
ty Senate has been scheduled lor
Monday. May l5 toallow lor action
on at least two items which weren‘t
discussed at the Senate's last
regularly-scheduled meeting of the
year a week ago.

A bill that proposes a chatigc in
the present course witlidlawal policy
will he voted upon at the meeting. as
will he one establishing a liody ol
faculty for supervising and guiding
doctoral dissertation woik at
HUN Y A.

lltc linal reports ol a another of
Senate ( oniinmittces should also be
on the agenda tor the special
meeting.

the course withdrawal bill was
developed late last week iii a Senate
subvcotnmittee chaired by Geology
Department faculty member John
l’ipkin.

Withdrawal Chant!)E

lhat bill. as part of a cotnpromisc
worked ottt iii the sub-committee
meeting. wotild cliatigc the present
policy by allowing students to
Withdraw from ii course half-way
through the semesteruithout having
a "W" grade recorded oti transcripts
" W" grades are currently assigned in
such cases.

the bill would also reduce the
length oftimc a student has in which
to withdraw from a course.

Under the proposed policy the last

day for withdrawing from a course
would be mid-way through the
semester. lhe old policy allowed for
withdrawals up until the eleventh
week of the semester. just prior to
final exams.

A number of students have sought
passage of a policy which would
eliminate the assignment of "W"
grades. Some faculty on the senate
have opposed the idea. and
suggested rolling back the last date
for withdrawals to cllntinatc \that
they call wasted teaching time.

Students can now withdraw from
a course without receiving a "W"
grade oiin it they do it during a
drop/ add period. which ends dttt itig
the second week of the semester.

Commencement Speaker

continued/ram page one

According to former SA Con-
troller Mike Hetchkop. however,the
promissory note still has not been
signed. Gold said. however. that SA
will still cover the $2600 note.

According to Baron. the com-
mittee formed by Class Council to
search for a student speaker will be
composed of three Class Council
members. one SA representative.
one representative of SUNYA‘s
academic honor society Signum
Laudis. and Assistant Vice President
for University Affairs Sorrell Chesin
or his designate.

“It was more or less thought that
since the Class Council has always
been the group that runs this type of
function. that they would get three
members. said Baron. “We wanted
to keep it small. and we wanted them
to get the most representation. We
also wanted someone who put time
into academic clubs. Someone from
Signum Laudis would better repre-
sent that tliiiti someone who wasjust
involved with social life on campus."

“i would imagine that part of it
will also be based on ltow they want
to present their ideas. what their
general principles are. but there is no
censoring." said Baron. "It's not of
that niittire. It‘s just who the com-
iiiittee feels will be an articulatae
speaker. We want a general student
who knows that there were budget
cuts a few ntonths ago. who can
make some kind of psychological
connection between as many
students as possible. to bring thetn
together by expressing contmon
feelings.“

According to Damn. the coin-
inittce has reserved tltc right to tiantc
no student speaker at all. if none of

the applicants are deemed satisfac-
tory.

“As I understand. very few
applications have been turned in
yet," said Bennett. "It's only two or
three people who‘ve turned their
names in. I consider the whole
process to be a farce.“ he said. “Peo-
ple didn't really respond."

Yesterday. Gold, Baron. and SA
President-elect Paul Feldman dis-
cussed the committee and the selec-
tion process with Vice President for
University Affairs Lewis Welch.
Dean for Student Affain Neil
Brown. and Chesin. The six decided
to merge the committee formed by
SA and Class of ‘78 Council with
SUNYA’s Commencement Com-
mittee. The incorporation will result
in an addition oftwo membersto the
Commencement Committee. since
the three Class Council represen-
tativcs and Chesin are already
members.

“They‘ll choose the student
speaker whothcyjudgeto bcthe best
all around," said Gold. “We have
time constraints. and people have
finals. so there aren't that many
applications. If there is no really
good student speaker. then we will
not go ahead with a student speaker
this year." he said. "They agreed in
principle that tltere should be ti stu-
dent speaker at graduation. What‘s
going to he done for the future is that
a whole committee will be formed to
make some long-term policy
decisions aobut commencement."

“I definitely feel that ifthey're gov
ing to have a graduating speaker.
tlteii that person should be picked by
a screening committee of some sort.
