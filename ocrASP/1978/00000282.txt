a committee that has a majority of
students on it.“ said Baron.
“Otherwise. there'sjust no way. It cer-
tainly should not be a committee
picked by the administration of this
school.“

“the faculty isn‘t really against a
student speaker," said Bennett.
“Some of the students on the com-
mittee aren't really gung-ho about it.
lhey‘ll have to be persuaded that the
person that the committee chooses
will be a good choice. not an ar—
bitrary choice."

“We feel that graduation is a time
of reflection about four years at the
University.“ said (iold. "liter's
nothing like one peer reﬂecting on
the changes that have occurred in
every student. We felt it is important

to have some student involvement.
Right now. the only student involve-
ment in the graduation process is
standing up and sitting down. If we
have no speaker this year. we won‘t

be able to get one next year. 'l'hey‘ll
say policy has been set. I guess it‘s a
rather strange situation: students are

fighting for a long-time tradition of

the University.“

The largest single change has been

order in which personnel must be

objective of the section is to insure

l'he present section details. more

According to Frisch. it. the UUI’
succeeds in its goals dttring the pre-
