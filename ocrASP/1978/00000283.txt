SLOW DOWN

A new poll by Louis Harris and
associates indicates that most
Americans distrust big business and
that they would rather conserve
resources than continually expand
the U.S. economy.

The Harris poll found that 8| per-
cent of those questioned expressed
the beliefthat big business. if left urt-
checked. “would almost always take
advantage of consumers."

The pollsters found that con-
sunters today don‘t embrace tlte
idea. promoted by business attd in~
dustry, that the economy nttist
always grow and productivity con-
tinually be increased.

According to the survey. bye 59 to
25 percent margin. Americans
believed that growtlt tends to over~
prodtiee products, which in turn
leads to waste. Sixty-eight percent
contplaitted that an emphasis on
growth makes tlte U.S. too depen-
dettt on natural resources that are
being depleted: and ()0 percent stated
that growth. as promoted by big
business. "falsely makes people want
to acquire ntore possessions than to
enjoy non-material experiences."

Said llarris iti summing up his fitt-
dings: “Basically. our people are far
ttiore concerned with the quality of
lilcandtarlesswitltllteunlitnitedac-
quisittott oi ntore physical goods and
products."

PUBLIC ENEMY
iliglt Times magazine reports that
more tltan 200 marijuana smokers
who have been arrested in South
Korea since 1976 ltave been settt to
an insane asylum where their
behavior aitd brains are being
studied.
According to the maga/tne.

2o

goverrr nment doctors at the
Huaaaang Asylum on the outskirts
of Seoul are attempting to
demonstrate that pot-smoking in
Korea is associated with a pro-
communist, marijuana-smoking

High Times says that Prisoners at
the institution are asked such
questions us: “Why do you rock and
roll?“ “What makes you smoke pot?"
"Are you a pot—smoking communist
agent?" and “Are you able to
describe the sensation of rotting
brain cells‘!"

South Korea‘s President Park
Chung Hec is reported to ltave link-
ed the fall ofSoutheast Asia to mari-
juana use. arid to have dtlbbed ntari-
juana “nternational enemy number
two after Cotitmunism.“

BUSY SIGNAL

A Carter administration official
telephoned a Lost Angeles radio sta-
tiott very early Tuesday morning to
complain about calls front the Lost
Angeles area which had been tying
up the Wltite House switchboard.

Discjockeysatstation KMI-I'l'had
been urging listeners to telephone
the White Ilotiseatid voice tlteirob-
jeetions to American support forthe
spraying of paraquat on marijuana
fields in Mexico.

/\ White House aide, calling over
one of the station‘s “request lines“.
complained that the phone lines at
|(t()() Pennsylvania Avenue were he-
ittg tied tip by as many as seven irate
pot smokers at a time. The adie
suggested that callers should either
telephone during “normal workittg
hours" or should complain instead
to the US. State Department.

SHADY DEAL

Are colleges and universities who
raise their tuition charges guilty of
using the old “bait-and switch" tac-
tic?

This question is being asked oftlie
U.S. Office of Education in
Washington after the Arizona State
Legislature revealed it may increase
the tuition at the University of
Arizona next fall.

Many students are complaining
that they‘ve tnade up their minds to
enroll iit classes next fall. and that
some have already completed ﬁling
financial aid applications.

According to Pat Mitchell.the ex-
ecutive director of the Arizona stit-
dent association: "It sounds like the
old bait-and-switch to me.“ Buil-
and-switeh is the illegal practice of
adveri g a product at a low price and
then selling customers on a higher
priced product after they beconte in-
volved itt the deal.

JOB PROSPECTS

Did you ever wattt to be a “Lump
Inspector" when you grew up? Or
how about a “Squeak. Rattle and
Leak Repairer" or better yet. ltow
about a “Wltil.7er'."‘

lhese arid more exciting career
opportunities await the eager job
prospector. at least according to the
government‘s new Dictionary of 0c—
cttpatiotial Titles.

Just for the curious. a “Lump ln-
spectol'" is a person who examines
lumps of tobacco for del'ects in the
wrapper leaves; and a “Sqtieak. Rat-

WHAT IT'S WORTH

The Fatted Call" Restaurant itt the
north Texas town of Stinger. serves
what you might call a priceless meal.

The menu includes such dishes as
a ten-ounce filet mignon. a 24-ounce
T-bone steak. apple dumplings and
homemade cheesecake.

There are. however. no prices on
the menu. On top of that. waiters
and waitresses work without pay or
tips. and there are no cash registers.
just jars for money on eaclt table.

IZach menu explains that there is
“No price on the service" at the

I‘atted Calf. So customers are asked
toput whatever they think the meal
is worth itt thejar. atid if they can't
pay. to take what they need out of
the jar.

KEEP IT CLEAN

Morality in Media. an outfit that
likes to keep things clean. is organiz-
ing a nationwide boycott of televi-
sion for May 23 to protest what they
say is an unhealthy emphasis of sex
on the tube.

Why did they select May 23?
Because. the group says. it’s a l'ues-
day. Tuesday. according to the anti-
sniut group. happens to be
television's most sex-oriented night
of the week. That‘s the night that
such sltows as “Soap” and “'I’ltree's
Company“ are aired.

Morality in Media. acknowledg-
ing that many viewers are virtual'l'V
addicts. is recommending that local
chapters sponsor other wholesome
distracting activities on the 23rd so
that even hard-core viewers can
make it through the day witltout suf-
fering severe TV withdrawal
problems.
