he llollics were one ofthc best

rock groups of the ‘60‘s and

are still putting outsome great

music today. Allan Clarke

(who co-peiined most of the
Hollies big hits) shares lead vocals in the
group with Terry Sylvester. (Graham
Nash left in 1968). When Sylvester put
out a fine solo album in 1974, it was
virtually ignored. 1 hope this will not be
the case for Clarke‘s latest album “I
Wasn‘t Born Yesterday.“

Clarke has an instantly recognizable
voice. so this album obviously sounds a
lot like the Hollies. 'l'hat is fine with me.
Clarke‘s back up baiid includes sttch
luminaries as Randy Bishop. (former
leader of the Wackers), Steve Kipner and
Mike Stilton (from the Stephen Bishop
Band). The strings are arranged by Gene
l’agc.

Clarke is strongest on ballads and
luckin there area good amount of them
here. “I‘m Betting My Life on You" is a
pretty ballad in the typical Clarke-Hollies
style. llowevcr. rockers like, “I Wasn‘t
Born Yesterday“ and “New Blood“ on
side one don‘twork as wellasthey should.

Side two is where the good stuff
appears. “(I Will Be Your) Shadow in the
Street“ is the single and if it isn‘t a hit. I‘ll
be surprised. “Light of My Smiles“
follows in a similar manner with notable
synthesizer work by Robbie Buchanan.

My advice to the prospective buyer of
“I wasn‘t Born Yesterday“ is to first
complete your Hollies collection (at least
get their Greatest Hits). and then check
out this album. If you like pop that‘s not
overly eommerical, then “1 Wasn‘t Born
Yesterday“ is for you.

nee again it‘s time for a trip

down memory lane with the

RCA Legendary l’erformer

Series a collection of
anthologies of early RCA recording
successes. On this particular occasion the
avenue is country music and the
performer is Jimmie Rodgers
(lB97-l933). respected by many as the
"King" of country music.

 

 

 

While sortie C & W fans would contest
such an attribution. "Jimmie Rodgers as

King“ appears to be the perspective
maintained by the producers of this
album. and so they treated the project as
such.

Wltethcr Rodgers is the “King"or not.
the packaging and presentation of this
collection are fit for one. it has nice cover
art. an informative booklet with pictures.
and one of the slickest rcprocessingjobs
ever accomplished (especially considering
that the recordings are rather obscure).

Of course, an attractive receptacle
doesn‘t always mean wholesome
contents. but in this case the selections
contained within arc of thc highest
calibre. Such country standards as “ M ule
Skinner Blues" and “'l' for 'l'cxas" are
most potent in their original recordings.
All the steel guitars in the world couldn‘t
enhance Rodgers‘ simple picking.
strtiinming. singing. and yodeling (yes.
yodeliiig!) on these numbers.

Rodgers‘ talent was a perfect
combination of good times and bad
times. with just a touch of class. l‘ew
other C & W artists havcevcr been able to
embrace the ironic humor of “In the
Jailhouse Now.“ nor were able to
dtiplicatc the despair of‘"l . B. Blites.“ The
theme of the latter was far from
contrived. since it was indeed

l'tiberculosis that ended Rodgers‘ career
at the young age of thirty-four.

Additional effects in this recording are
provided by recorded dialogUes between
tracks where friends. relatives. and fellow
musicians discuss various aspects of

Rodgers career. life. and character.
Whether these serve as an aid or
hindrance to listening is questionable.
since it would have perhaps been wiser to
let the music speak for itself; it most
certainly is capable of doing so.

But despite these small technicalities.
the overall effect is quite satisfying. The
music entertaining. the extraneous
information fairly interesting. and the
packaging is artistic and attractive. What
more could a king ask for'.’

ichard Wagner‘s debut album

presents itselfas an interesting

synthesis of various musical

styles of the early seventies.

Wagner, a capable guitarist
on his own right. has brought together an
array of qualified musicians and
production people to ptit together a
pleasant collection of tunes to pleasejust
about cveryone's musical tastes.

There is just about every type of music
on the album from heavy metal to reggae
to a strangely pleasing type of Nashville.
llis influences include the Eagles, Allce
Cooper. early Elton John. BillyJoel. and
numerous other artists of the seventies.
One can readily see where the Alice
Cooper‘s influence comes in. as the album
is cit-produced, engineered. and re-mixcd

by Bob Ezrin. who worked on many (U

 

 

 

Cooper's earlier efforts. The opening cut
of the album, “Some Things Go On
Forever," features vocals by Wagner
which sound very similar to Cooper‘s
mellow vocals. The song features an
excellent guitar solo by Wagner with ﬁlter
guitar supplied by the virtuoso ofstudio
guitarists. Steve Hunter.

Wagner seems to have taken all the
important musical styles of the seventies
and incorporated them into his own
concept of what music should be. The
songs are all very listenable. but there are
times when Wagner seems to have lost his
own musical identity. “ Nightwork.“ for
example. sounds a lot like Bob Segcr‘s
“Nightmoves.” bttt is saved by some blues
guitarwork supplied by Wagner and
Hunter. “Hand Me Down llcttrtaclics."
strongly resembles the liaglcs‘ “ fake it to
the Limit." In fact. if it weren't for the
difference in words and the inclusion of
sotite slick guitar licks. I would swear I
was listening to the linglcs.

I l- - r s y
“.tgnci could hate done a lot tiiore than

This is not to say that the album is m)
good. for there is some really good guitar
work on all the songs. “Go Down
logether" is a song which is exemplary of
what Wagner is capable ofdoing. It starts
off with a rousing guitar solo a la Hendrix
then slides into a well produced rocker.
All the songs on the album, as a matter of
fact. are slickly produced. In fact. the
album is almost too slick. i doubt very
much that Wagner could recreate the
album music in a live performance.

Taken as a whole. Richard Wagner has
ptit out an album which shows that he has
a lot of promise and potential once he
starts heading into a musical direction
where he feels comfortable. Right now. it
seems as if he is experimenting with
different styles and succeeding iii all of
them. However. with a producer like Bob
li/rin and a back—tip guitarist of such
talents as Steve Hunter. I think that

is present on the albtim.

 

 

They Could Have
Danced All Night

(And They Did)

By JERRY MIK()RICNI)A

bile most people on campus

waited for a reprieve from

Friday's weather and

wallowcd in the sun and beer

of the Mayfesl. a determined
group of people from the Kappa Delta
sorority ran a dance marathon for the
Capital District Multiple Sclerosis
Foundation.

Dance marathons. which were once
used to make money during the
Depression lira. now exist largelon raise
money for charities. Debbie Seliwart/.
the Director of the Marathon said. "A
dance marathon is good for this sort ol
thing because it can keep things going."

l'hc marathon began in the Campus
Center Ballroom on Friday May Sat 7:00
pm and went on for 36 straight hours till
7:00 am Sunday morning. [he method of
fund raising is similar to that used by
walkathons; people pledge a certain
amount of money per hour that a couple
dances. 'l'hcre are half hour breaks every
six hours, and ten minute breaks every
hour to keep the dancers as fresh as
possible.

Couples involved in the marathon
came from the University. as well as
surrounding junior high and hiin
schools. “()ver 80 packets were sent out“
explained Schwartl. "but we expect the
number of couples will drop down to
about half of that by the time the
marathon begins." Ms. Schwartz was
pleased with the student participation
and repeated several times that "MS is
full of dynamite people." Multiple
Sclerosis of Albany fronted any money
needed to set tip the marathon and most
0f the marathon‘s supplies had been
donated by local organizations. Along
with M.S., the Cirle-K Key eltib assisted
the sorority. and radio stations WCDB
and W'l‘RY donated l).J.‘s. music. and
equipment for the thirty-six hours.

Despite the donations and help from
area people. Ms. Schwartz was
disappointed at the arrangements made
with the S.A. to rent the Campus Center
Ballroom. "Orgintilly we were supposed
to have the marathon duringthe weekend

ol April l4»io. but they ISA.) had to
chatth the date because of a conflict in
scheduling, so we ended tip having the
marathon on Mtiylcsl weekend.“ Because
ol the Mayfcst. and other parties on
campus. the sorority feels that many
people who would have normally been
involved or come otit to visit the
marathon did not.

Other points sllclt as lack of ftindiiig
iroin SA. and lack of coverage in the past
have set back Kappa Delta‘s gotil of
riiising$ l0.000 dollars for MS. Schwartz.
said "We were charged $4.300 dollars for
the tisc ol the (‘.('. Ballroom. which is a
reduced rate. but l‘in sure they don‘t
charge lclcthon anything when they use
the Ballroom." Later on she added. “I wish
we were ltlndcd the way lclctliou is."

llaliwziy tlirottgh tltc event on
Saturday tittcrnoon only thicc of tlic Jtl
rcgistcicd couples had dropped ottt. lhc
dancers were mostly lrom high schools.
with four or live couples coming from
SliNYA. Complaints ladcd throuin the
ltollowecliocsofthemusic."Whodothese
l).J.'s think they are playing. Yes?" yelled
one girl slumping into a chair. "How can
you get into dancing to 'l'opigraphical
()cctiiis".’" Despite the complaints. things
picked tip when the sun began to break
tlirotigli the morning mist. "Don‘t worry.“
said Schwartz. who was still dancing. “I
consider inysell a dynamic person. 1'”
keep everyone psyched."

By the end of the marathon halfoi the
30 couples had dropped out, but over
4(i.000 dollars was raised. a figure which
is on par with last year‘s money. Sunday
morning‘s highlight was the scheduled
arrival til two hicyclcrs who were making
a trip from Illinois to Toronto. After
that, the prizes were given ottt. Everyone
who entered won something. with first.
second and third prizes being given to
couples who received the most votes from
people attending the event. [he prizes
Were: two 250 dollar saving bonds, two
portable ’l'.V.‘s. and a pair ofclock radios.
