Lowell Wciker and Daniel Schorr for graduation, but themselves settle
for an actor.

‘l’he L'Iass ot~ '78 has seen their elected class council blackmailed by
two former SA executives who wanted a student speaking at graduation.

l'hese officials threatened to freeze money allocated for senior week by

SA to make up for the Benecke debt until the council talked to the
committee about student speakers.
this was an obvious tibUse of power, but it is somethingthe Class of‘78
has Iiad to deal with for years. ' '

When it comes time for the senior class to graduate, it is customary to
wish its members good luck. lit the case oftlie Class of‘78, however, it is
more fitting to wish them better luck than they had at SUNYA.

reasons, absurd. Students and faculty

done nothingto improve their spoken linglislt.
