We have lived in the some dorm lor 2 years
and have remained lriends through out that‘
time. We have experienced many good and
bad things — Great Adventure, water
lights, movies, housing. double dates,
snowstorm disaster, library talks, midnight
pizzas, twilight discussions, kosher dinners,
and especially Amy 5. — and have
continued our lriendship. Next year will be
dillerent tar me, not being able to always
have a "listening" ear. You were there in
times at lortuno and mislorturte, always
willing to lend a helping hand. You deserve
the best 0! luck next year in Medical School

Eggs.
Winning it all and being the best has always
been the goal lor the Eggs. This yearwas to
be our last shot and all we wanted to do was
to go out on the right note, Well, asit turned
out, we did go out on the right note but it
was dilterent tram anything I could have
Imagined. What we wanted to do was to
win a title and be recognized as the best.
But the way we pulled together when we
lost makes losing one game seem as trivial
as it really is. The closenesswe have had has
been the greatest thing that has happened
to me in a longtime. I can't even begin to put
into words how much it has meant to me. We
didn't get the shirts but we still won in the
end. The Eggs will always be number one in
my book.

Captain
p.s. I would like to thank everyone once
again lor the plaque. It will always mean a

"You'll learn tram the best."
You've been at it three years
With only a permt
And hacking into the hydrant
Made me nervous as shit.
You side-swiped a van.
And nearly killed the man.
You ran down a birc
And denied it like a nurd.
You claimed that I had lied
But I know that pigeon died.
Hell, I write this poem
It's all done in iest
Causo in my heart
I know you‘re the best.
But I'll tell you right now
You had better pass.
