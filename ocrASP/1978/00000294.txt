by Richie Mermelstein

You can learn a lot by listening.
My parents always told me that. I
never paid the advice all that much
attention. but then again. it wtts not
until this week that I had the oppor-
tunity to listen to Albany State track
and field coach Bob Munscy.

The picture on the back page of
the ASI’ two weeks ago prompted
me to seek out the intriguing
Munsey. I found him at five in the
afternoon Monday. as he finished
discussing the fact tlitit the mile relay
team cannot enter a certain meet due
to a lack of funding. Ispcnt the next
few hours of my life listening.

"We just don‘t have enough
money. Ideally. if there‘s interest in
any sport. you find the money. llie
only guideline should be interest. In
the past we've dipped into the sur—
plus. but \vcjust can't do it anymore.

“Some schools manage to find the
money. Ml'l' has more intramural
programs. in fact. more of all sports.
l‘llll then again. people give money to
private schools. btit not to pitblic
schools in the cast. It all traces back
to otir history. Izach state originally
was given a land grant. Ihe schools
iii the east. you remember. are
dillcrcnl than in the west. bccattse
the cast was settled before the United

States was the “tilted States. So. in
the cast people give money to private
schools. aitd in the west there are

different loyalties; people support
state schools.

“History. I‘m
history."

“One of the problems is the fun-
ding given to women's sports. Don‘t
get me wrong tiow. I think the
growth of women in sports is great.
in fact. it‘s one of the greatest
sociological phenomena of ourtinie.
But there are seine inequities at first.
This may just be an initial aberra—
tion..... it does take money to get
started. But my budget hasn‘t beeii
increased in IS years. and there are
some women‘s teams with three
members receiving funding for teti.

“You can call it sexism or call it
racism it you want. But I‘m tired of
the pompous announcements frotii
tli - administration on affirmative ac-
lltcy give its "newsletters"

interested iii

tion.
which are nothing more than opi-
nioii letters. telling tls that affir-
mative action is right. I'm all for
women sports. but their budget
should be based oti their numbers. I
think a newsletter should give news.

“llie administration. they‘re the
ones that have to enforce the rttlcs.
It‘s not their fault. 'Iltey have to
enforce the guidelines of affirmative
action. I just wish tltc govcrtiiitcnt
would get off their back.

"I'll tell you something though.
Vincent ()‘l.cary is just grand. the
nicest gtty I‘ve met. I‘iclds. lie was

good too. He knew what he wanted.
But the best president this school has
ever had was Van Kollins. He kept
the school on a high plain. above all
the other teacher‘s colleges. When lie
started in I954, he was theyoungcrl
president Ufa/010‘ your school! The
youngest one in the country! Iliat‘s
history.

“I chose Albany because of its
history. I was attracted to it because
it was the oldest ptthlie school to
train teachers. In the country! How‘s
that for history?"

“I was Director of Housing at the
old campus. We had tiglttcr restric—
lions then. but they didn‘t object to it.
l'iiiies are different. In fact. the girls
likctl the curlews‘. If they were out
with a boring guy. it gave them an
excuse to get back.

"llercs’s some more history for
you: When the Alumni Association
oi the Albany State College for
lcaclicrs built I’ici‘ce arid Saylcs
llalls iit |‘)3‘)~|‘)4l. it was the first
lllllt: that dormitories had been bitilt

"Anyhow. we‘ve got to seek alter-
natc sources oi raising money. l'or
instance. we ticcd a crowd control
system at football games. so that we
can charge admission. Who‘s going
to pay when ltc can just go to the top
ol tltc hill and watch the gatitc'! tiatc
receipts are an alternate source we
lia\cii‘t touched yet. Aitotlici
problem though is the horrible car
situation. We original plan was for
this campus to ltavc no cars, \oti
could get anywhere by bicycle. It has
going to be a bicycle caiiiptisl llicy
didn‘t plan for the parking lots. and

 

Munsey led to the history lesson.

Big Moose. The star athlete ol
mythical Riverdale Hiin School of
Archie Comic llook faitte is perhaps
the perfect example of the
stereotyped dumb jock. Whenever
someone thinks of tire varsity athlete
this is the intage that usually comes
to mind.

However. the athletes Iicrc at
Albaity State certainly do not fit this
iitold. I lieir diverse itnd outstanding
talents indicate that this popular
stereotype is nothing more than a
myth.

“None of ottr tcaitis arc |ust a
