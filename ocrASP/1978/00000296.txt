continued from page one

the assignment of a fixed number
of places to a minority group is not
a necessary means toward that
end." Powell wrote.

In his explanation of how far
schools can go in considering an
applicant's race. Powell cited the
admissions program at Harvard
as being designed to ensure racial
and ethnic diversity while
selecting students with a broad
range of talents and geographic
backgrounds. ‘

Powell wrote: “In such an
admissions program, race or
ethnic background may be deemed
a ‘plus' in a particular applicant's
file. yet it does not insulate the
individual from comparison with
all other candidates for the
available seats."

But Powell said the Davis
program. which kept Bakke out of
school by specifically setting
aside 16 minority places out of 100
openings in the first—year class,
“would hinder. rather than
further. attainment of genuine
diversity."

Citing his interpretation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. which
guarantees equal protection under
the law. Powell said the Davis
minority admission program was
not shown to be necessary to
achieve the school‘s stated goals.

Powell dismissed arguments
over whether the affirmative
action program at Davis set
“quotas” or "goals." saying that
whether the Davis limitation was
described with either term “it is a
line drawn on the basis of race and
ethnic status."

Bakke. who now is a 38-year-old
engineer for the US. space
agency. said he was “pleased”
with the decision and planned to
enter medical school in
September.

Officials at the school said they
would obey the law.

Black leaders expressed mixed
emotion at the court's decision.

Court Case

Ralph Smith. chairman of the
Legal Education Task force of the
National Conference of Black
Lawyers. said he hopes “the court
hasn't become the assassin of
affirmative action."

But Dr. Joseph Lowery.
president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.
said that as long as such schools
are open to blacks "then I think we
can live without fixed quotas."

The court's seven separate
opinions were written by Powell.
Marshall. Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger and Justices John Paul
Stevens. William Rehnquist,
Potter Stewart. William J.
Brennan Jr.. Byron R. White. and
Harry A Blackmun.

Powell. Burger. Stevens.
Rehnquist and Stewart agreed to
the decision striking down the
Davis program. Powell. Brennan.
White. Marshall and Blackmun
agreed that some affirmative
action programs may be valid.

In a separate opinion in which
Burger. Rehnquist and Stewart
agreed. Stevens wrote: “In
unmistakeable terms. the 1964
Civil Rights act prohibits the
exclusion of individuals from
federally funded programs
because of their race."

Marshall's dissent predicted the
Bakke decision would produce
dire consequences for efforts to
achieve racial equality. "It is
because of a legacy of unequal
treatment that we now must
permit the institutions of this
society to give considerations
about who will hold the positions
of influence. affluence and
prestige in America.

“For far too lond. the doors to
those positions have been shut to

Negroes. If we are ever to become a

fully integrated society. one in
which the color of person's skin
will not determine the
opportunities available to him or
her. we must be willing to take
steps to open those doors.“

History & English on the Disabled List

. When the muscle-flexing over
‘SUNYA‘s history and English
PhD programs began. the line-up
included President Emmett Fields
and Chancellor Ernest Boyer
playing for the SUNY Board of
Trustees. and State Education
Commissioner Ewald Nyquist at
bat for the Board of Regents.

By the time the word came down
from the State Court of Appeals.
the faces had changed
considerably —— Vincent O'Leary
in for Fields. Clifton Wharton for
Boyer. and Gordon Ambach
picking up the save from Nyquist.
The issue. however. has remained
constant throughout: Does .the
Board of Regents. acting through
the Commissioner of Education.
have the power to revoke the
'i'egistration of doctoral degree
programs it. deems to be
academically deficient?

On June 13. 1978. the Court of
Appeals said yes. Unanimously.

The winners took the news
casually. “As far as we‘re
concerned." said Arnold Bloom. a
spokesman for Ambach. “this was

the final word on it. If SUNY has
any other plans. they certainly
haven't told us about them."

The decision does not signal any
drastic change in the policy of the
State Education Department —
just business as usual. “We were
challenged. and we were upheld by
the court. that's all." Bloom said.

Elisabeth L. Moore. who was
chair of the Board of Trustees until
her term ended yesterday. was one
of the losers. "The decision settles
some pertinent matters between
SUNY and the Board of Regents
which in recent years have been
left unresolved." said Moore.

“We are disappointed in the
outcome. but we‘ll do our utmost to
work with the governor and the
Regents . . . to further clarify and
improve working relationships
between the University and
Department of Education.

Of course. President O‘Leary
and SUNYA are ultimately the
biggest losers. The legal avenues
in the state have been exhausted.
and O'Leary has no intentions of
bringing this to the federal level.

There are alternatives. however.
and O'Leary lists them with a
guarded optimism. The university
could commit significant
resources to these programs and
re-submit them to the SED for
registration; or accept the end-
result of the court's ruling and
work on beefing up doctoral
programs in other areas. "What we
have to do now is really re-
evaluate our steps here . . . it will
require both outside and inside
evaluation." he said.

 

SUNY vs. The Board of Regents

Which brings us back to the top
of the first inning. to the state-wide
doctoral evaluation
commissioned in January of 1972
that laid the groundwork for the
terminations. The Fleming
Commission Report on Meeting
the Needs of Doctoral Education in
New York State said: “One major
reason for the review of priorities
is the serious financial stress
experienced by the higher
education community generally
and doctoral institutions

particularly . . . In addition. the
demand for doctorates . . . has
largely been satisfied . . . The

Nation may be facing a glut. of
doctorates in the next decade and
beyond in many fields. unless the
present rate of doctorate
production is moderated.

in line with this reasoning. the
Commission called for more
efficient utilization of resources in
doctoral education. "This means
the reduction of unnecessary
duplication and competition in the
State's system." stated the report.

Seven months after the Fleming
Report. the Regents issued
Position Paper 19. a document that
adopted the essentials of the
Fleming Report. recommending
thatonly programs ofhigh quality
be continued. It went even further.
however. in specifying how “high
quality" was to be determined.

Albany's history PhD program
earned the following description:
“inadequate quality and need — to
be phased out over an appropriate
period of time."

The Regents then established
the Office of the Doctoral Project.
to both conduct on-site
evaluations and rate the program

   
 

in question.

Albany‘s history program
received mixed reviews from the
rating committee. Boyer claimed
that. the “overall thrust of the on-
site visit was a positive one.
suggesting many more strengths
than weaknesses." Nyquist.
however. paid more attention to
the sections of the report that
outlined the "modest decline" of
the history department. "The
University faces a series of no-
growth budgets in the next few
years. and there seems little
likelihood that additional
positions will be allocated to the
history department."

in a letter to Boyer on June 12.
1975. only three montiis before the
termination of the history
program. Nyquist outlined the
deficiencies of the history
department as identified by the

   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

rating committee:

“The faculty is not highly
productive or prominent; only one
professor is nationally recognized
as a leading authority in one ofthe
broad fields of history . . . The
doctbrai student is very small;
there is not a sufficient number of
students to provide either for
effective seminars or for the kind
of out-of-class learning
indispensable for fledgling
historians.“

There will have to be substantial
change in both the history and
English departments if they are
ever to see doctoral students
again. The rebuilding program
begun under Fields has been
maintained by O'Leary. The
question now is whether or not he
can find the money to not only
maintain. but substantially
improve the two departments —-—
provided. of course. that he does
want those two i’lii)‘s off the
disabled list and back in the ball
game.
