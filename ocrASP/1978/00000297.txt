The Freshmen Summer

 

 

They wear name tags. carry
folders and ask naive questions.

They are the rookies. the recent
high school graduates who chose
SUNYA as their new home.

More than 2000 freshmen, will
visit the campus this summer to
participate in one of nine two—day
planning conferences. The
conferences will be held twice
weekly from June 19th to July
24th. The 250 students attending
each conference are housed and
fed at Colonial Quad.

During the conference the
incoming freshmen receive
academic adviSement and register
for classes; tour the university‘s
buildings and grounds; meet other
freshmen; and hear talks on pre—
law and pre-med programs as well
as other academic offerings.

“This year’s freshmen are
super-energetic. bright and
willing to learn.” according to
conference coordinator Pattie
Snyder. Snyder and her staff of 19
are administering their second

freshman conference. They also
work on seven transfer
conferences and a few EOP
conferences.

You can't go home again —
Thomas Wolfe

On my way to lunch I spied a
two—column company of freshmen
stretching from Indian Quadtothe
podium. After a hearty lunch at
Sutter's bar I caught up with the
remains of the entourage on
Colonial Quad. Most people were
on the podium attending
scheduled talks on pre—law. pre—
med and business. Wearing
Converse sneakers. blue athletic
shorts and a green T-shirt. I
descended on the sundry
stragglers adorning the quad
courtyard.

"This would be a good place to
smoke dope." a faceless gal from
Peekskill exclaimed. I wrote down
her remark and asked her name.
“I‘d rather you didn't put my name
in the article." she said. Seconds

later. seemingly springing from
the cement. her parents appeared.
Two of more than a hundred
parents that attend the the first
day of the conference. They are
invitedtoatalk on the university's
resources and given a bus tour of
Albany. a trip the more protective
parent should avoid.

In front of the quad flag room I
spoke with a woman from Rome.
N.Y. She had a rich. clear
complexion. fresh amber hair and
were no make-up. I was reminded
of a picture I‘d once seen on a

was the only school to which she
had applied and this was her first
visit. “I feel like I know where all
the buildings are already. I might
get bored with it." she said. She
had just returned to the quad from
the pre-law meeting. "I'm
interested in political science.“
she said. "I'd like a career but I

She spoke with the qulel
confidence of someone who has;
lived in the country a long lune
“You're the first person I've met,"
she confessed.

“You‘re lucky 1 got to you below-
anyone else did." I rutoi'll‘li
jocularly.

Sim and Susan were leaniugon
a pillar. They lived in Hrooklyll
and arrived in Albany this
morning on the same Greyhound
bus. Still. they didn't meet until
lunch. where their shared interest
in salads established a common
ground.

Sim Wore his ash-colored illtll' :tl
car's length. He was clean SilllVi‘ll.
Boyishly handsome. his face was
dotted with half freckles. His eyes
were small. but intense. and look
in the surroundings grecdily.

“I'm socially conscientious."
Sim said. “I chose Albany because
it is the capital. and I'll probably
be able to work as an intern wil-h
the Legislature or a law firm." “0

needs a lot of improVement." Sim
commented seriously. "I want t0

will either major in business or
psychology. “I'm sure college will
be harder than high school but 1
can't really know how much I‘ll
need to study. A friend of mine who
goes here said he‘s in the library
every day."

Susan is glad to be moving away
from home and is looking forward
to her new freedom. “I like
knowing that its up to me how
much I'll party." she said, adding
that she doesn't intend to do too
much partying.

The business of America is
business — Calvin Coolidge

Forty-five percent of the class )f
‘82 plan to concentrate theLr
studies in one ofthe miscellanem s
manifestations of the
entrepreneurial spirit —-
accounting. finance or marketing.

“This seems to be the place to go
for business."Co-op city emigrant
Robert Shevlin said. “Besides. the
weather‘s rough in Buffalo.
Stoneybrook’s on the island and
who wants to get stuck in
Binghamton.“ Shevlin attended
the Bronx school of Science and
plans to enter the five-year
Master‘s program in Business
Administration. He sported a
fuzzy beard still in its infancy; he
was the only bearded frosh I saw.

With almost half of the school's
new blood already badly bitten by
the business buy. humanities
professors must be cringing with
disbelief. I can imagine them
haunted by a nightmarish reverie.
Their departments dissolved.
these weighty scholars are re—
trained in the mysteries of
bookkeeping and the csoterics of
marketing.

Full—blown carecrism belies
little change in student concerns.
Freshmen worry about what
courses will be closed. who their
friends will be. and of course. how
bad the winter will be. With so
much pathos. myth and hope
surrounding the ritualized exodus
from the home to the university.
the freshmen I met were oddly
self-assured. They know what lies
ahead: the struggle to forge a
career and a good life.

What they didn't show me was
the part of themselves that simply
doesn't give a fuck what happens;
whether they flunk out or make the
dean's list. get elected class
president or carried away by the
white slave trade.

May Be Next Year’s Sardines

 

llomesickness and Eco 100a
might not be the only causes of
unhappiness to incoming
freshmen if present housing
statistics released by the
Residence Office this week hold
true.

According to the figures, the
number of students requestingon—
campus housing this fall will
exceed the normal occupancy
space by 500 students. If this
overpopulation materializes.
students will be housed in
Resident Assistant suite rooms.

gl‘cst rooms and some tripled
rouns. The Residence Office is
currently trying to obtain
additional rooms at the Hotel
Wellington. and is looking into the
possibility of utilizing residence
space at the former St. Agnes
School in Loudonville. about 15
minutes from campus.

"There are basically three
factors that have caused this
problem." said Director of
Residences .lohn Welty. "l<‘irst.
during spring continuing student
sign-up. a couple hundred
students beyond what we had
projected for requested housing
space this fall. This was
especially the case among the
sophomores. Two years ago. (59
per cent of the sophomores living
on campus requested space the
next year. This year that figure
has jumped to 75 per cent,"

“The second factor is incoming
freshmen. For the last three years
we‘ve always taken 150 students
beyond normal occupancy. and
regular spaces normally open up
four or five weeks into the fall
semester due to students not
showing up or applying for open
release. This year we‘ve admitted
more freshmen than we had
projected for. The same is true
among the transfer students that
will be entering the university this
fall."

According to Welty. if the 500
student surplus does materialize.

studentscanbehousedoncampus.

 

 

The university is presently
searching other avenues to locate
housing facilities for the
remaining 250 students.

“We've been talking to the
Wellington Annex as well as St.
Agnes about the possibility of
housing SUNYA students." said
Welty. "We also hope to expand out
listings of housing available in
the city."

When asked if the Country

Squire Motel was a possible site I

for student housing. Welty replied.
“[ don't believe we'd consider
that." The Country Squire was
used to house students during the
fall of last year and was criticized
by student residents for the lack of
basic services.

A decision concerning the St.
Agnes complex. which was
considered last summer. is
expected to be made within the
next few weeks.
