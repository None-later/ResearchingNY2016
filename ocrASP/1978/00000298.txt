While it is not yet known what
the final repercussions of the
Supreme Court‘s decision in the
Allan Bakke “reverse
discrimination" case will be.
SUNYA Affirmative Action
Associate Gloria. DeSole
yesterday expressed concern at
the potential to curtail the

advancements affirmative action
programs have made in recent
years.

“I was disappointed. but not
surprised." said DeSole yesterday
afternoon. “I expect that there will
now be a field day of
misinformation in whatl see to be
a very narrow ruling of a very
weak case."

“I think it is important to
remember that affirmative action

‘The Bakke Victory:
What Happens Now?

programs do not serve only the
historically deprived groups. but
the whole of society. Talents of
any that are lost are lost to the
whole nation."

DeSole described the reasons
that lead her to expect yesterdays‘
decision as threefold.

“First. it’s a conservative court
and this was a weak case for a
clear decision. Unfortunately. it
doesn't properly illustrate the
merits of affirmative action.
Secondly. there were a lot of
technicalities in this case. I don't
know if the case was decided upon
these technicalities or on the
merits of affirmative action; I
haven’t seen the decision yet.
'l‘hirdly. we're in a time when
people are worried about their
livelihoods and are less noble. less
idealistic. more likely to consider
the practical."

Affirmative Action Associate Gloria DeSole

 

While DeSole termed the
decision “dreadful.” she called the
Court's decision. “an opportunity
to educate people‘in the concepts
of affirmative action."

"What happens in cases like this

those people who enter programs

Saratoga Performine Arts Center:

A Sweet Southern Song

It bore some semblance to
an artist's conception of hillbilly
heaven. A few strokes of the brush
could resolve discrepancies and
fill voids; substituting hashpipes
for corncobs and vodka for corn
liquor. But the main elements
were already there.

Of course. there were the Tucker
troups — bare-chested. dungaree—
vested disciples brandishing the
crimson-backed crossed stars of
the South. Warm vodka and

orange juice streamed through
their three-day boards as they
drank from sawed-off milk
containers. waiting with anxious
anticipation.

Then there were the all—weather
rock fans. the type who dropped
acid at Dead concerts and dropped
dead at the sight of Barry
Manilow's tightly clad crotch. No
particular affiliations. just cool.
objective appreciation.

Despite the furious
consumption of various
stimulants and depressants. few
were too blind to see the Marshall
Tucker Band emerge onstage. and

 

everyone instantly became a
member of the white lightning
generation. The new Saratoga sect
ofcowboys stomped and howled as
lead vocalist Doug Gray fueledthe
fracas. "Ya‘ll ready to get up off
yer asses and have a good time?"

Tucker tore into their first tune
and unveiled a mural of a
stagecoach in tow behind a team of
horses that consumed the entire
backdrop. The cowboysjumpcd on
the chairs. clapping their hands
high over their heads. Mild-
mannercd men of milquetoast
posture strummed their tummies
as if they had been weaned on
“Tennessee hooch."

But all shit—kickin' aside.
Tucker played skillfully. crossing
a myriad of musical genres
without losing the country theme
that brought them to the big time.
Their music was sometimes brash
and ferocious. sometimes sweet
and gentle. always unpredictable.

The guitars of Geroge McCorkle
and Tommy and Toy Caldwell
merged into a hard-hitting rock
backbone for tunes like “Dream
Lover" and "Can't You See,"
settling back into a steady country
cadence for “Fire on the

 

ock ‘n’ roll

 

 

 

Mountain" and "llcard It in A
Love Song." 'l‘oy Caldwell proved
himself It master of the electric
guitar in several feverish breaks
throughout the concert.

The saxophone and flute
playing of Jerry lilubanks adds a
dimension to the Marshall Tucker
Band that is absent in other
“southern rock" groups. such as
The Outlaws. Eubanks' moaning
sax and lilting flute allow the band
to leave rock for a jazz break and
ultimately fuse the two styles.

Drummer Paul Riddle sounded
consistently on target. but
unspectacular. playing in a
shadow cast by the band‘s
arrangements. Doug Gray‘s lead
vocals were powerful. though
hampered somewhat by a loud.
crowded mix that often rendered

lyrics incomprehensible.

 

'l‘ucker played a broad blend of
the old. the new and the favorite
from their repertoire of six
albums. plugging some tunes
("Dream Lover." "Love is A
Mystery") off their recently
released Together Forever LP.

One of the last songs in their
performance. a seemingly
impromptu version of “24 Hours
At A Time.“ was highlighted by a
slow. blues exchange between
Eubanks‘ sax and Tommy
Caldwell‘s bass.

Living up to their image as a
people‘s band, Tucker returned for
three encores. driving the crowd of
more than 18.000 to its feet.

With their diversity. prolific
history and enthusiasm there is
this possibility —- The Marshall
Tucker Band might well be
"Together forever."

Honorable mention should go to
Jay Boy Adams. a Texas based
band which pulled duty as
Tucker‘s warm—up act. The
group's country—rock versions of
traditional folk songs and original
tunes combined with a warm stage
presence to keep the crowd
entertained and orderly.

.lay Boy Adams didn't just bang
out five or six unkown songs and
blow kisses to the audience on the
way offstage. They told stories
about the music — how
inquietudes became inspiration
for some of their original
compositions. and how tales of
legendary characters like John
Brown and the “Tennessee Stud"
compelled others to take pen in
hand.

Jay Boy Adams is a simple.
pleasant sounding country band
that thrives on interaction with
the people it performs before.
Perhaps they'll never make it big
in the rock n‘ roll race -- unless
they get hold of some glitter. . .
