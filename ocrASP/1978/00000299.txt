Mesmerization: Traces of Svengali

A circus hypnotist was arrested recently in Yugoslavia
when. after mesmerizing 10 members of the audience. he
couldn‘t awaken three of them. A village doctor took over
the act and broke the trances after several hours.

As P. 'l‘. Barnum might say. “That's show biz."

As Lee ’l‘urney would say. “That‘s terrible!"

Turney has been practicing hypnotism professionally in
the area for four years. and he cringes every time he hears
such stories. He and his partner. Many Ann Kalisz. run a
clinic in Clifton Park called Total Mind Techniques. Inc.
They use hypnotism to treat everything from nicotine
addiction to poor bowling technique, but say the problem
that‘s given them the most trouble is the distorted notion
many people have about the technique they use.

“There‘s lots of people who are leary of hypnosis because
it still has traces of Svengali.” says 'l‘urney. “That’s very
unfortunate."

’l‘urney is not the first to lament hypnotism‘s lack of
acceptance. Sigmund Freud used it in the late 18005 to help

form his theory of psychoanalysis but was ridiculed by his _

colleagues; he later abandoned it. A century before that.

 

Anton Mesmer, also a Viennese physician. used a

Edwin F. Nikirk. one of
Christoff’s lawyers. said an

other doctors had given up on. Though he was often
successful. his peers denounced the technique as quackery.
The methods have changed somewhat since then: subjects
are no longer told to concentrate on the “dangling object"
long considered to be the hypnotist‘s main tool. But the
principle remains the same. A state of deep relaxation is
