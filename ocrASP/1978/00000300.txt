“I can‘t think of a. better analogy
than having a baby and rearing it,“
was how Student Dwellings Inc.
Board Member Karleen Karlson
described last month‘s acquisition
of two buildings by the group.

Student Dwellings Inc. is a not-
for-profit corporation started two
years ago by a $20,000 grant from
Student Association for the
purpose of buying and renovating
houses for SUNYA student
occupancy. After a. year of
mortgage refusals and an SA
administration which failed to
show the support that its
predecessor did for the project, a
mortgage was finally granted and

two apartments. 314 and 316
Hudson Street. were purchased.

According to Karlson. the
buildings need a lot of work before
the buildings present eleven
occupants are relocated and
students are selected to move in.
The apartments have numerous
code violations. like many rented

which will have to be brought. up to
standards. The installation of a
sprinkler system is one example
of the work that will be performed
on the buildings in the coming
months.

The buildings will house fifteen
stu icnts in eight apartments when
rehabilitation is completed.
Because of the expense of putting
in separate meters is too high for

the corporation presently to
absorb. the rent will include heat
and utilities and will probably run
under $200 for a two-bedroom
apartment. Leases will run twelve
months and be easily

understandable. There will be a
superintendent living in the
apartments who will be
responsible for sweeping
hallways. removing snow. cutting
grass. replacing lights. etc.

“We hope that the apartments
will be break-even. plus." said
Karlson. "It's extremely

KENNY LOGGINS IS HIS OWN MAN —- In his high-energyperiormance
Friday night at the Saratoga Performing Arts Centerhe reached back to
the Loggins and Messina era for only one song, “Angry Eyes." The
balance of his concert tunes were selected from his “Celebrate Me
Home" LP and his recently released “Nightwalch” album. Loggins was
well received by the relatively sparse but enthusiastic crowd.

 

 

MISS/lips

Student Dwellings, lnc.. recently purchased buildings at 314 and 316
Hudson Street. The buildings will be sub-divided into 8 apartments. No
decision, however, will be made until the fall.

"I can sec us expanding. it the
academic community would give
academic credit to a. few business
majors so we can have someone
handling bookkeeping and
coordinating maintenance. I can
see us growing."

Karlson answers questions
concerning the value ol a program
that will house only fifteen
students by citing some long
range effects of the program.

“It‘s worthwhile because it gets
people who never thought about
the problems of off campus living
to think. It causes a ripple effect
among the administration. faculty
and students. it will also serve as a
model, something that we can say
‘Look what we can do!‘ That in
itself is worth a lot of mileage."

track record. We want to be able to
show people who are funding us
and people who we would like to
fund us. that we really do have our
heads together."

Karlson's concern about this
initial venture is linked to her
desire to see Student Dwellings
continue to grow.
