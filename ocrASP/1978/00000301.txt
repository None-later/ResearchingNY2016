suggestions. According to

'l‘urney. hypnosis produces this
state by temporarily tuning out
the brain's logic function. freeing
the memory to store ideas that
normally would be met with a
barrage of defenses.

The chronic overeater, under
hypnosis. might be told. “You will
eat only at mealtime . . . You will
eat only the foods that are good for
you. . . You will eat slowly.“

Not everyone who comes to
Total Mind Techniques is
hypnotized. the partners say. An
initial interview helps screen out
those whose bad habits are rooted
in serious emotional problems.
Hypnosis could harm such people,
'l‘urney says. because the
behavioral change would
eliminate only a symptom of the
larger ill. Left untreated, it could
surface later in more harmful
actions.

“Being non-medical. we‘re
overly cautious." says 'l‘urney.
who refers unsuitable clients to a
doctor. psychologist or therapist.
“We don't go around changing
behavior indiscriminutely."

No charge is made for a referral.
but those who undergo treatment
shell out an average of $85 for
three visits. Most people are
surprised to learn that more than
one session is necessary. says
'l‘urney. who claims "only one
person in a thousand can be
treated in a single visit." The
client who expects to pay his foe

       
     
   
   
  
 
  

and then take a nap while his
problem is mysteriously
exercised is also in for a
disappointment. Patient
participation is essential. the
partners say. Subjects can and
should remember what goes on
during hypnosis.

"People think hypnosis is a
sleep state because you look like
it." says Miss Kalisz.

“You're not asleep or
unconscious.“ adds ’l‘urney, "and
you‘re not out of control  We
always encourage people to
remember."

The patient receives an
individualized set of suggestions
during hypnosis ("It‘s like
recording over an old tape,“ says
’l‘urney), and is told to reconstruct
the process each day for 10
minutes. Most people would call
this self-hypnosis. but ’l‘urney
says there’s no difference. "All
hypnosis is self-hypnosis. ’l‘he
hypnotist is just a guide who
teaches you a technique."

Though the suggestions differ.
the process is the same for all. A
softly lighted room with soothing.
piped-in music provides the
atmosphere. while 'l'urney and
Miss Kalisz give the impetus.
"Picture a passive scene." one of
them might say. as the patient lies
still. eyes closed. Once the subject.
is comfortable. a series of positive
suggestions is given. over and
over.

Problems range from the
pedestrian to the profound.

 

      

Obesity and smoking top the list.
followed closely by stress. Many
students come to them for
increased concentration and
recall. One patient. an aspiring
attorney who had just completed
law school. called them at wit's
end. He had taken and failed the
bar exam three times because he
fell to pieces whenever he entered
the testing room. After hypnosis.
he took the exam again and
passed.

Many sportsmen are attracted
by the lure of a better score. One
professional bowler told them he

. wanted more concentration on his

game. After treatment. he claimed
to have bowled his best games.

Other patients are just plain
lonely. "We have dozens of people
who come in here to talk and never
undergo hypnosis —- and pay for
this service." exclaims ’l‘urney.
"One of the mostvaluable services
we provide is communication."

Some would—be subjects never
make it past the initial phone
contact. Take. for instance, the
man who said he had stuttered all
his life and wanted to be cured ——
two weeks before his wedding.
Another caller wanted them to
hypnotize his wife so that he could
cross-examine her about
extramarital affairs. He. too. was
turned down. Hypnosis is not a
truth serum." ’l‘urney says. "You
can lie just as effectively under
hypnosis."

llypnotism is centuries old but
still in its infancy. Laymen have

wacky ideas about its powers
because some hypnotists continue
to use it as an entertainment
device. Worse still, some
practitioners abuse the technique.
Turney and Kalisz tell anumber of
horror stories to illustrate.
including the one about a “non-
professional." as they call him.
who hypnotized a group of teen-
agers. “This age—group is
particularly susceptible to
hypnotic suggestion." according
to ’l‘urney. “He was giving them
hallucniations and told them.
‘there‘s a snake on this desk.‘ Most
of the kids started jumping away.
but one girl just stared at the desk
and then started screaming
hysterically." In that state. she
couldn‘t be brought out of the
trance. 'l‘urney says, so they took
her to a psychiatric ward. where
she spent the next three days.

“The subconscious takes things
literally.“ says 'l‘urney. He feels
all hypnotists should be trained
and licensed to help prevent such
incidents. The public should be
educated. too, says the area
hypnotist. who is tired of hearing
gems such as the one his father
produced some years ago: "You're
going to get into a lot of trouble
with this hypnosis.“ he warned.
"you‘re going to hypnotize
someone and they‘re never going
to come out."

So far this hasn't happened. and
though 'l‘urncy has no crystal ball
to gaze into —— he‘s banking that it
won‘t.
