before the Lecture Center and
gazed bleary—eyed at the snow that
covered the barren scene outside.
The fountains were frozen over
and had been frozen ever since late
October. Other students passed
slowly by. Some sat down in front
of the doors. lulled by the
suffocating indoor heating and the
dull technical words written in the
textbooks they were reading. It
was another cold. dark winter in
Albany and although the campus
was teeming with people. it could
not escape from the cold. frozen-
te-the-core feeling that the entire
city experiences every winter.

The lone student let his eyes
stare fixedly at the analog dial
face of his watch. The time was
9:55; in 15 minutes he would have
to attend his statistics course. a.
course which he not only disliked
but one which overwhelmed all his
senses. made him feel like just
another number in the class of 423.

University Photo Service photographers Mary
Ann Hovak and Howie Jacobs. Howie is pictured

him he had contracted worms.

 

 

 

 

The entire situation. the context
of the situation. was entirely unfit
for learning. Gazing down at the
statistics text which two
assuredly brilliant academicians
had so generously written in the
interests of educating their fellow
man. Norman. whose pseudonym
was 272 (that was his number on
the class role). began to dream
about the summer. He knew that
the summer would arrive. but
found it difficult to imagine just
when. This strange feeling was at
the root of many of his most
depressing hours. staring out of
his ninth floor tower window.
trying to melt the snow with his
stare.

A few more students sauntered
through one of the doors leading
from the tunnels to the lecture
center courtyard. ’l‘hey entered
into the artificial light. seemingly
treni the bowels of the earth —I—
back from the dead. None of them
spoke a word. It was clearfrom the
way their eyes voraciously
devoured their notebooks thitt
they would soon be tested. It was
going to be an important test.
Norman rested his eyes once
again upon his watch. almost
subconsciously.

it was 10:05 already and the low
hum that he had noticed some
moments before gradually rose in
pitch as more students began
filtering into the courtyard
flooding it with different colors
and shapes. As Norman was
wondering how the cute girl with
long brown hair would look with
nolclothes. ii. guy w1tli bushy black
hair and steel‘hlue eyes wandered

Norman listened as the song
faded away. and soon found

himself being whisked off into the
Lecture Center by the multitude
crowding the doorway. He took
one last look at the frozen-over
fountains before the door lending
to the lecture center slammed shut.
and the students quieted down.
waiting for the professor to begin
the day‘s lecture.

“Why do I come to the fountain?
To get a suntan before I go to
work,“ answered the sleek. tan
woman sunning herself as the con
refreshing mist of fountain water
enveloped her. Her voice could
barely be heard over the din
caused by thousands of gallons of
rushing water. The sun was
shining brilliantly in the
cloudless blue sky and all of its
worshippers had arrived. While

some read paperback novels and
others splashed around in the
waters of the fountain throwing
l'risbees.

“l CUlIIL‘ here because there‘s no
place else to go.” said Alan Alpcr.
a senior. "it's not that this place is
nicie. it's just that there‘s no other
place open to me Within it five mile
radius to go to,"

" Deep down inside hcjust wants
to get a tan because he's not
working.” said April l’ettit. a
junior taking courses over the
summer. “it's nice to see who’s
around for the summer and it‘s a
good place to read.”

Alpcr said. "l feel bad for the
people tlial are coming as
freshmen at orientation because
they're not getting the true image
of the school. During the summer
this place is like a resort."

Susan Luiiictti. a senior. said
she Comes to the fountain
“because it‘s a great to see peoplel
know and spend time socializing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On top of all that. it‘s agreat way to
get a suntan." Observing the
magnetism created by the
fountain during the summer. Miss
Luinetti added. “In the wintertime
you don‘t even pay attention to the
fountain. but in the summertime. it
becomes the social center of the
campus."

"I like the little kids here." said
Richard Dobrusin. a. junior. “They
bring all the kids from St.
Catherine's. Ninety per cent of
these kids are victims of child
abuse and broken marriages.
When they come here. they're in a
college 'atmosphere. People play
with them and they have fun. This
college is usually such a sterile
community and its nice to see
people other than students
around."

Mark "the Shark" llaft. a recent
g 'aduatc. was so enthusiastic
about the fountain that he said. "1
want my wedding at this fountain
when 1 get married. I love this
place. It‘s my favorite place in the
world." The Shark also said he
likes to meet people at the
fountain. "especially people of the
opposite sex.”

Tom Van Schoor. a graduate
student in counselling and
personnel services admitted that
he never hung out at the fountain
before. “it's the first time l‘vc been
down here.” he said. "i just like
studying outside. it keeps me
awake and it's nice and cool down
here." But. Van Sclioor. who
completed his undergraduate
degree at Allegheny College. felt
that there was something there
even better than the fountain. "On
nice days like this I used to sit on
top of my fraternity house and
drink beer with my friends.“

A sophomore visiting friends
for the weekend said she "just
likes to sit around and watch
people as they watch other people
and watch themselves." Judy
ltuben plans to spend a lot of time
in the sun this summer as a
swimming instructor. and feels
that the fountain is “a place to kind
of get away and daydream. It‘s a
place to watch the water and just
plain relax. When i see other
people studying it's like the last
thing I want to do; the farthest
thing from my mind."

So you want to get away from
schoolwork and warm bones still
frozen from Albany‘s abominable
winters. So you haven‘t found iijob
yet. and the sure thing you were
counting on to bring you through.
fell through. So you're having
problems with your boyfriend or
girlfriend. and you were stood up
last week. Don't consider suicide
as an easy way out; go to the
fountain. Just remember. you and
Norman have been waiti iig for this
moment all year.
