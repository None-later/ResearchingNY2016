' JAWS 2 —-—

Jerks Victims Under

If you liked Jaws. you'll love
Jaws 2. The plot is essentially the
same — shark terrorizes summer
resort town. shark chews up a few
locals. sheriff kills shark.

Steven Spielberg. the director of
Jaws. had nothing to do with Jaws
2, but the formula he laid down in
the biggest grossing movie of all
time was faithfully adhered to in
this year's model.

Jaws 2. like all horror flicks, is
not suitable entertainment for the
squeamish or tenderhearted; the
scare techniques and the
mechanical shark are as good or
better than ever.

John Williams. the man behind
the music for Star Wars and Close
Encounters, turns in yet another
effective score — the two note
“shark-is-coming" theme hasn't
changed.

The seaside town of Amity sees
the arrival of its second giant
great white shark in Jaws 2.
Returnees include Roy Schneider

Pat McGlynn

Ias Sheriff Matt Brody; Murray
Hamilton as the tourist trade
conscious mayor; and Elaine Gary
as Mrs. Brody. Richard Dreyfuss
does not repeat his portrayal of
ichthyologist Matt Hooper. since
between Jaws and Jews 2,
Dreyfuss won an Oscar and
jumped up a few notches on the
price-per-picture scale. Brody
tries to locate Hooper once he's
convinced that there is indeed a
great white feeding on his
townspeople. but finds.
conveniently for the producers.
that he's in the Antarctic and
unreachable for the next six
months.

The score at the end: Shark 9.
Sheriff 1. The shark‘s total
includes three scuba divers. one
water skier. four boaters. one
helicopter plus pilot. and several
small sailboats. The sheriff's
score is . . . well. you know the
shark's gonna get it in the end. the
suspense lies in just how many

 

 

[humans he‘ll gulp down before he
I goes.

There's no explanation given as-
to where the shark came from. or
why he happened across the same
stalking grounds as . his
predecessor. But questions like

these have no bearing on the
purpose of the film — to scare the
living daylights out of you.

So what if this shark looks just
like the last one; working giant
shark models are rare and
expensive. and how many of you
have ever seen one in the flesh
anyway?

Jaws 2 is meant as
entertainment. and it entertains
quite competently. A little shark
research shows nothing

especially unnatural about the
movie's monster; sharks are
nasty. unpredictable. powerful.
nearly indestructible. and very
dangerous to humans.

As sequels go. Jaws 2 is pretty
good. But Jaws broke new ground
and set new records. and remains a
tough act to follow.

The story line suffers in
comparison. with many more
untiedends andanot—so-explosive
finish. Apparently hoping to
capitalize on the 12-14 year-old
summer vacation market. Jaws 2
has a stronghigh school slant. The
shark and the story feeds heavily
on swim—suited teenagers
frolicking in the Atlantic.

But while the ending is less
dramatic. the beast from the deep
does take longer to expire this
time around, and you‘ll enjoy
every second of it. In the original.
the shark just blows up. Perhaps
Spielberg underestimated the
primeval satisfaction such ascene
can bring out in an audience. Or
was he just worried about flack

 

 

from the ASPCA?

 

 

 

JAWS TOO —
Jerks Audiences Off

The good horror movie has
much in common with good
erotica. With each. audience
arousal is the god to which the
elements of plot. characterization.
music and pacing must bow in
subservience. This is cinema at its
most pragmatic; quality is simply
amatterofwhethcrornotitworks.

Jaws worked. Jaws 2 does not.
And the key lies in subtlety of
approach. Just as a constant

 

Spence Raggio

 

barrage of bouncing breasts and
sweaty bumps and grinds is
enough to send one off into
daydreams of Marilyn in
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. too
many shark‘s-tooth close-ups can
quite easily destroy the film‘s
delicate balance of tension.

Unfortunately. director .lcannot
Szwarc seems to have borrowed
more from Deep Throat than from
Jaws. Spielberg proved himself rm
attentive and talented student of
Hitchcock, realizing that his best
“ effect" was the imagination of his
audience.‘

Szwarc gives the audience more -

information than the characters
have. setting up the classic
Hitchcockian formula, but fails to
follow through on the next step:
the audience must identify with
the character. must care about the
kids being chomped. And the
major flaw in Jaws 2 is that this
identification isn‘t there.

The opening credits are still
rolling when the shark claims its
first two victims. a pair of scuba
divers. In one of the film's better
scenes. a water skier is next. yet
Szwarc follows it up with what is
certainly the film‘s most ludicrous
moment: an attack on the skier's
boat. with the shark poking its

great grey rubber snout through
the side of the boat as the woman
on board beats it hysterically.
finally shooting at it with it flut‘c
gun and blowing the whole boat
into driftwood in the process.

The film then settles into some
semblance of character
development. consisting mainly
of Roy Schneider looking worried
and some clever adolescent banter
by the teenagers of Amity. The
audience. though. is kept a little
too far away from those people to
be more than curious that
guessing which of them will buy it
before the grand finale.

By using physrcul gut-
wrenching instead of emotional
gut—wrenching to drug it response
out of its audience. Jaws 2 lowers
itself" to the level of porno.

In what should have been tho
most gruesome chomping of the
film. when one of the girls
becomes shark food after saving
the sheriff's smallest son. Szwurc
I‘umblcs it by going for int
emotional whrrllop that just isn't
there. The girl. never even
introduced bcl'orchund. is
forgotten us soon as 5111‘s gone.

'l‘herc's tnorc. of course. The
beach-scare scene. and the shark
vs. helicopter brittle could have
come straight out of a Mad
Magazine parody of Jri ws. And the
ending is straight out of Godzilla
Meets the Japanese Air Force.

Ah. well. If you're really
strapped for something to do this
summer, you'd be better advised to
go through old news accounts of
the shark attacks in Atlantic City
that convinced u lot of people that
maybe an unprovolrcd shark will
attack it hutnun. At IcrLst you‘ll
find SUIIIU drama thcrc. And just
when you thought it was safe to go
back into the movies again . . .
