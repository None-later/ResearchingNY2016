BEEPER MADNESS

The Massachusetts Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals is warning that beeper
signals in some home smoke
detectors can drive dogs berserk.

Doctor Gus Thornton of the
ASPCA in Boston says that ahigh-
pitch beeper signal is given off by
some smoke alarms to warn of a
battery failure inside the alarm.
He says that in recent months. he
has encountered at least three
cases in which the high-pitched
noise drove canines wild —
causing one agitated dog to leap
through a glass window to escape
the sound.

According to Thornton: “The
solution for the dogs‘ problem is to
change the batteries immediately
or remove them so the beep will
stop."

GOOD SHIT. GRINGO

The Mexican government has
been spraying thousands of
marijuana fields with toxic
herbicides, despite reports that
paraquat and other chemicals
may be extremely hazardous to
pot smokers.

An article published last week
by El Universal. one of Mexico’s
biggest daily newspapers, sheds
light on how seriously the
Mexican government views
marijuana use.

The headlines over a four-
column story proclaim: “There are
more than 100 million marijuana
addicts in the world today."

The story goes on. to quote
Doctor Alejandro Oscos Alvarado
of a Mexican research institute as
stating that pot addiction is
spreading worldwide. and that it
seems to be — in his words —
"irreversible."

The doctor says that millions of
students are becoming hooked on
the weed. and that they use it like
amphetamines to get more
intellectual output for exams at
school. Doctor Alvarado adds,
however. that students ignore the
fact that what they learn while
stoned is forgotten when the drug
wears off.

In addition. Doctor Alvarado
alleges that too much pot use can
lead to death. No studies were
quoted to back his allegations up.

PLOP. PLOP. FIZZ, FIZZ

 A vaginal suppository which

reportedly will safely induce
abortion may soon be available to
women in the early stages of
pregnancy.

The British publication New
Scientist reports that the
preparation. which contains a
hormone. can be administered
either by a doctor or by the
pregnant woman herself.

The new method reportedly
minimizes the side effects of
vomiting. diarrhea and cramps
that often accompany abortion.
New Scientist says it has been
tested on 209 women at the John
Radcliffe Hospital in England.
Those tests. which were supported
by a grant from the World Health
Organization, proved effective in
terminating pregnancy in 83 per
cent of the cases.

The magazine says that the new
abortion method, is good for
women in the very early stages of
pregnancy. Most of the women
tested were said to be abouttwenty
days pregnant.

According to New Scientist, the
method is advantageous. both
psychologically and emotionally,
because patients avoid the
distress of a delay in diagnosis
and arranging a more fear-
producing surgical termination.

SING. GYPSY
Singing humpback whales may
soon be able to enjoy some human
serenades .if a New Yord
biologist’s plans for an
underwater concert succeed.
Roger Payne of the New York
Zoological Society is planning to
sing back to the humpbacks — the
only species of whale known to
sing —— using a powerful
underwater speaker. Payne hopes
to borrow the speaker. which was
designed specifically to imitate
the sounds of submarines and
destroyers — from the U.S. Navy.
Payne has recorded whale songs
for fifteen years and is known for
recording an album titled “Songs
of the Humpback Whale.“ He says
he will visit an isolatedhumpback
colony near the Cape Verde
reports. he will try playing songs1
of Hawaiian humpbacks to the
Cape Verde humpbacks to see if
the Hawaiian melodies will alter
or gradually be incorporated into
the African whale songs. The
songs from humpbacks from one
ocean area are entirely different
from those in another region.
Payne says his studies will help
to show just how intelligent the
huge sea mammals are. and might
in fact at some later time help to
establish t’wo-way conversations
between whales and humans.
