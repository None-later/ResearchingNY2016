be heard in the September term of
the sixth Judicial District of State
Supreme Court.

That‘s when a lawsuit filed by
the State Board of Equalization
and Assessment against the Town
of Hardenbergh. in Ulster County.
will go to trial.

Last year the board filed suit
against the Town of Hardenbergh
after Town Assessor Robert
Kerwick granted property tax
exemptions on 211 parcels of land
in the town. The homeowners had
all become ministers of the
Universal Life Church and
claimed their parcels of land were
their places of worship.

Parties on both sides of theissue
said that they reached an

Court to Consider Tax Break
For Ulster Mail Order Ministers

agreement Wednesday before
Judge Con Cholakis in Troy to
stop filing ancillary motions and
appeals and go to trial onthe main
issue of whether the Universal
Life Church is a valid church
under state laws.

Judge Cholakis was not
immediately available for
comment.

Kerwick said Wednesday's court
session was a victory. “Now we
are going to get down to the issue
which we have wanted to get down
to." he said.

However. Tyler expressed the
situation in opposite terms.
saying “the town has agreed to go
to trial on the question of whether
members of the Universal Life
Church are eligible for
exemption."

Power Quest Choking Valley

(PNS) To the people who live
along the Ohio River the
advertising message of Edison
Electric Institute — “The Time to
Build Power Plants is Now" —— has
a special meaning.

Residents of Maysville say
existing power plants mean fly
ash in their cisterns. respiratory
illnesses and pollutim. they can
taste in the morning.

Thirty-three steam power plants
capable of producing 28.000
megawatts of electricity already
line the Ohio River in Illinois.
Indiana. Kentucky, Ohio. West
Virginia and Pennsylvania. And
utilities. attracted by the nearby
coal and the river — a
superhighway for barges ~— have
announced plans for enough
plants to produce an additional
19.000 megawatts by 1986.

If construction is not delayed.
that would be a seventy percent
increase in productive capacity —
a capacity that some critics
contend would outstrip needs.
Furthermore. these critics
contend. the increasing energy
development will exacerbate an
already difficult pollution
problem in the Ohio River Valley.

“We‘ve got some pretty serious
air pollution problems in the
basin.“ said Dr. Hugh Spencer, a
University of Louisville
biochemist and engineer who is a
member of a team studying the
impact of energy development in
the region.

In a draft report on its first year
of work in 1977. the team
concluded that high electrical
energy growth — an annual rate of
5.4 percent — would “more than
double the expected number of
premature deaths over those
expected under the low—energy
growth option" —— an annual rate
of 2.8 percent.

Health hazards connected with
the high energy growth include
those associated with coal mining
and nuclear power plants as well
as with air pollution produced by
coal-fired plants.

Down river from Cincinnati,
valley residents have focused
their anger on the Marble Hill
nuclear being built by Public
Service Indiana. But in Maysville.
65 miles up river from Cincinnati.
the objects of citizen wrath are the
coal plants.

“These things just kill you
gradually." Dr. Harry Denham. a
physician. said about the five coal-
fired units (a sixth is on the way) of
two power plants near Maysville.

And his colleague, Dr. George
Estill, said. “We‘ve got a lot of
chronic lung disease everywhere.
It's a high humidity area anyway."

The Mason County Medical
Association to which they belong
was party to an unsuccessful suit

a year and a half ago to block
construction of the second unit of
East Kentucky Power
cooperative's Maysville plant.
The association argued that the
environmental impact statement
for the project was inadequate.
Although a motion for a
permanent injunction is still
pending. the unit is being built.
and the medical association and
its allies say they have run out of
money to keep fighting.

“We're all shocked." Denham
said. "There's nothing we can do.
There's no sense in beating your
head against a stone wall. You
have to be realistic and bow down
to it."

What residents of the Ohio
Valley may be bowing down to is
suggested in the not-yet-
published first-year report of the
Ohio River Basin Energy Study
(ORBES) funded by the
Environmental Protection
Agency and conducted by faculty
members of universities in
Illinois. Indiana. Kentucky and
Ohio (West Virginia and
Pennsylvania were added this
year.).

According to the draft of that
report. air pollution levels in the
ORBES region — most of the land
area in the four states — already
are disporportionately high.

Particulate emissions are about
95 percent greater than would be
expected from the region‘s 14
percent share of the nation‘s
population. And current
emissions of particulates. sulfur
oxides. nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons exceed what. would
be expected of the land area (four
percent ofthe nation) by more than
200 percent.

In the Maysville area. fly ash
from the Dayton Power and Light
Co. across the river has been a
prime source of complaint.

Consequently. when East
Kentucky Power built its first
Spurlock unit at Maysville. it put
in an electrostatic precipitator to
remove particulates and keep
emissions "clean-looking."
Ronald Rainson. East Kentucky

evaluation program. said. “It's
very possible that the monitor
isn‘t located in such a way that it
would record the worse
conditions." He said he was sure
Dayton Power and Light is
“putting out quite a bit" of
pollution. “but it may not be
coming down where the monitor
15."

Bernard Hargett. Mason County

 

“These coal-fired plants just
kill you gradually,” said Dr.
Harry Denham, a physician.

 

 

Power president and general
manager. said.

But that unit was built before the
EPA requirement that it use either
low-sulfur coal or a scrubber to
take sulfur out of high-sulfur coal
emissions.

"In my opinion." Rainson said.
“these gases aren‘t the problem.
Nor are the particles being taken
out." He believes ultimately that
“The really harmful things“ are
the fine particulates that current
technology does not remove.

Although the power plants in
the Maysville area are not using
even the best available technology
on emissions. a monitor set up by
Kentucky‘s Division of Air
Pollution Control showed no
violations of primary health
quality standards between
October 1975 and September 1977.

Asked why the monitor showed
acceptably clean air when
residents experience the air as
dirty. Larry Wilson. director of the
division's development and

attorney and a leader of the
Maysville Chapter of Save the
Valley. does not look to the
government for help in stopping
the proliferation of power plants.
In 1971. he said.the Division of Air
Quality in Kentucky
recommended that the
Department for Natural
Resources not grant a permit for
Spurlock No. 1. “They ignored the
recommendation of their own
staff. Since then we haven't found
any ally in the state bureaucracy."

Nor. he said. has help been
forthcoming from national
environmental groups. The issue.
he said. is not dramatic enough.
“You build these power plants and
people are not going to fall over
like dominoes."

But the fate of the valley is far
from settled. ,

East Kentucky Power says it is
going to have to raise rates 20
percent by 1980 to pay for the
scrubberthat Spurlock No.2needs
to comply with EPA regulations.
Soaring costs of building other
new plants are expected to push
rates even higher.

At some point consumers and
utility commissions may call a
halt to the spiraling rates —- and
the building.

According to Fred Hauck. an
environmental consultant from
Shelbyville. Ky.. and a member of
the ORBES advisory committee.
the companies are overbuilding
because each system believes it
will be able to export power to
industrial areas in the region. Yet
the heavily industrialized north
section of the ORBES is gaining
population at only about half the
rate of the United States as a
whole. he said.

“All these systems have been
building like hell not realizing the
slowdown in industry in this
whole area. it’ll hit them in about
two years that there's no place to
export it." he said.

Predictions that natural gas
shortages will increase the
demand for electricity also look
