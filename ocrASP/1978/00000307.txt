'What's a Nuke?’

 

 

They were set on stopping the
Nuke. Three thousand of them
were camped out on the site of the
Seabrook Nuclear Power Facility
that weekend. Some had come
from as far away as Minnesota and
Florida. A group of several hun-
dred had bicycled from western
Massachussets. Several hundred
more had walked the 60 miles from
Boston in a "walk for safe energy."
They were the core of the move
ment. the determined. the
idealists. They were the Clamshell
Alliance.

.They spent weeks in prepara-
tion. They were tightly organized

 

 

 

 

 

  
 

 

into regional “affinity groups" of I

10 to 20 persons with names like
“No-Nukes of the North." and
“Clam Sandwich." Each person
had a specific duty within his or
her group. such as medic.
spokesperson. or media person.
They would do nothing without the
consensus of the entire group.
They were as firm in their com-
mitment to non-violence as they
were in their opposition to nuclear
power. All had gone through a
weekend of training in non-
violence resistance. They had a
list of guiding principles which
included. “In the case of aconfron-
tation. we will sit down.“ They
were set on stopping the Nuke. and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 
 
  
  
  

 

many were prepared to .remain at
Seabrook until plans i'orthe facili-

restored.

The man setting up the solar
cooker display was from Troy. He
is a physicist who "no longer
works for the military industrial
complex.”l—Ie had been working on
a high-security project and one
day found out that it was a weapon.
He quit soon afterwards.

“Some people will not work in
science and technology at all. But
I'm not against technology. It's
only because of technology that
we can feed all the people in the
world. But too often when we
scientists look for technical
solutions to problems we forget
the people who will be affected.
We've got to start using
technology to serve people’s
needs. not the whims of business
and the military. Humanize
technology. not technologize peo-

The Seabrook residents were
ready to help the Clam in any way
they could. They had already voted
two-to—one on three separate oc-
casions to stop the nuclear facili-
ty. They had also voted to stop sell-
ing water to the developers. and to
ban the transport of radioactive
material in the town. They offered

 

campsites. shelter, at

mits and reassess property taxes
if there was any trouble.

The townspeople talked with the
Clamshell people. Finally. only
days before the occupation began.
the Clamshell Alliance voted to
accept the State's offer.

The 18 acres were on a filled-in
marsh and garbage dump. There
were so many insects that the state
had to spray huge amounts of in—
secticide. Demonstrators were ad-
vised not to walk barefoot.

Thirteen thousand others. in-

mitment to occupy. Others were
not so sure of their positions. A
few were members of radical or
other fringe political groups eager
to jump on the anti-nuclear
bandwagon. Some were just

: curious.

The mile-long road from the
town to the site had the festive at-
mosphere of a county fair. Folk
musicians played dulcimers and
fiddles and sang anti-nuke songs.
A theater group did a piece in
which the power company‘s sym-
bolic mascot. Reddy Kilowatt. and
a mad scientist figure were
stopped in the nick of time from
ravaging a character symbolizing
the People by a super-hero named
Solar. One group had built a wind-
mill generator which could power
a small house. Another set up a
television powered entirely by a
half—meter square photovoltaic
panel. Solar cookers and smaller
windmills. were everywhere. and
there was even a "methane-
generating shitter.“

Local food-coops sold food at
cost. Hawkers sold buttons. t-
shirts. and banners. "All proceeds
to the Clam." I bought a shirt
which read "No Nukes.“

I have been to rallies before. I
have seen masses of people rais-
ing their hands and voices
together in protest. I have seen
tens of thousands marching with
arms linked down the streets of
state and national capitals. By
those standards the rally at
Seabrook was small. even tiny.
This action. though, was different

in a vital way.

Everywhere at Seabrook there
was a sense of maturity. These
people were not there to scream
rhetoric. nor to throw bombs at
banks. nor to take drugs. They
were not rebelling against their
parents or teachers. They were not
there because it was the "in" thing
to do. as portrayed by television.

These people had thought about
the situation carefully. They were
acting as responsible humans
concerned about and worried by
this threat to their safety. They
were not only criticizing but
presenting alternatives. energy
alternatives. political alter-
natives. social alternatives. To
those who they saw as a threat to
their safety andJiberty they were
responding with the motto of the
early Americans: "Don‘t tread on
me.“

For the most important issue at
stake is not whether the Nuke at
Seabrook should be built. The
critical issue is not the economic
insanity of nuclear power, nor the
possible environmental damage.
nor the waste-disposal problem.
though each of these is enough to
stop nuclear development. More
important is the flagrant die-
regard of the desires of the people
who will be directly affected by the
nuclear plant. New Hampshire
follows strongly in the New
England tradition of town
meetings and local rule is sacred.
yet the town's anti-nuclear vote
remained ignored and construc—
tion continued. The lesson of

Seabrook is that the people are
tired of being ignored, that they
still want to control their own
lives.

A red volkswagen stopped at the
sight of my raised thumb and gave
me a ride back to Boston. The
driver was a grad student in
American Social History. He talk-
ed about the rally in a weary.
almost jaded tone.

“Yeah. the spirit of the action
was good. It was a good example.
The plant might be moved or
stopped. There might even be
some changes in energy planning.
But look!"

He waved his hand toward the
approaching Boston skyline.

“Every year more poeple are
thrown out of their homes because
a corporation is building a
skyscraper over them. Or they
lose their jobs because of a cost-

profit analysis. The society keeps
getting more impersonal. the
government bigger and less
responsive. the people continue to
be shoved around. and ldon‘t know
if anything can stop it."

He steered off the interstate and
into the city.

A few days later the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission decided
that the cooling system of the
proposed Seabrook plant was im-
properly approved. and that per-
mission to build was suspended.
Seabrook was stopped.

A week later I was in atavern on
Long Island. A woman at the bar
looked over my t-sliirt and asked.
"What‘s a nuke?“
