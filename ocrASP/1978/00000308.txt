The ‘Flea’ Hits Sour Notes,

 

But Learns to Laugh Them Off

Summer theatre at the Perfor-
ming Arts Center opened up this
past weekend with The Amorous
Flea, a “musical comedy" based on
Moliere‘s School For Wives that
might be better described as a
comedy in spite of its music.

The story itself is an hysterical
romantic romp. The quest for an
ideal bride leads the elderly Ar-
nolphe. overplayed to perfection
by William Leone. to sequester
away a four year old girl and
shield her from the evil and im-
moral influences of the world. In-
side a door inside a gate inside a
moat inside a wall. Arnolphe is

her only contact to the outside
world. He can mold her ideas and
thoughts as he chooses. insuring
himself a wife of purity and in-
nocence —- commodities that were
evidently in as scant supply in
seventeenth century France as
they are today.

Hilarie Delman is delightful as
the childlike bride-to-be Agnes.
the perfect foil to Leone‘s leering,
jealous old man. Under the confi-
dent direction of Edward Golden.
the two of them give Moliere the
enthusiasm and spirit he deserves
and walk off with both the play and
the audience solidly in their
hands.

If only their talent were as con-
tagious as their enthusiasm seems
to be. Especially in the case of
Robert Saloff as Horace. son of an
old friend of Arnolphe. who falls in
love with Agnes. He does not so
much deliver his lines as moan
them. in a fashion no doubt design-
ed to epitomize love-struck.
idealistic youth. It‘s as about as
effective as his effusive fawningto
Arnolphe. done with such an
absence of sincerity that he comes
close to parody.

As a playwright. Moliere is

aware of his audience. He has Ar-
nolphe address his comments on
marriage to the married
gentlemen in the theatre, and one
of the play's funniest moments oc-
curs when Arnolphe. after
meeting Horace on the street for
the umpteenth (and particularly
inappropriate) time. throws up his
arms in exasperation and ex-
claims. "There must be another
street in Paris!"

But Jeffrey Dunetz and Lori
Feldman. playing Arnolphe‘s ser-
vants. are conscious of their
audience as actors rather than as
characters. detracting from what
should have been two of the better
roles in the play. »

O

Musically. The Amorous Flea is
less than stellar. Bruce
Montgomery‘s songs are neither
funny nor memorable. They don't
even possess the saving grace of
advancing the action; one number
by Daniel Duross as Chrysalde
brings the show perilously close
to a complete halt.

The company also seems to lack
the musical equipment for such an
undertaking. No one in the play is
gifted as a singer. although
everyone pulls through in a more
or less competent fashion.

But pianist Patti St. John and
percussionist Brubbi Taylor had
more of a problem finding the
right sound together. As simple
vehicular transportation for the
lyrics they were fine; however. the
use of the tympani and the piano
intros to each scene were quite
noticeably overblown.

The Amorous Flea does have its
weaknesses, yet there are definite
strengths. too. And the truly amaz-
ing thing about this show is how
those strengths —— specifically
Leone. Delman. Golden. and of
course. Moliere —- turn it around
into a thoroughly enjoyable
evening's entertainment.

 

Power Plants Choke Valley

continued from page three
premature. according to Hauck.

A nationwide emphasis on
lower energy use growth would
further out increases in demand.

Asked how much thought Mason
County residents give to slowing
down economic and energy
growth. Hargett said. "not much at
all."

In fact. part of their anger at the
power companies stems from
bitterness that a promised
industrial park to accompany
East Kentucky's Power's

Spurlock plant did not materialize
to bring jobs and money into the
community.

“I think people in this area
would have been satisfied with the
company if they had done what
they had said they were going to do
initially." he said.

Said Martha Comer. a columnist
and former editor of the Maysville
paper and once a promoter of East
Kentucky Power. “I really
believed these sons of bitches. I
really believed they were going to
get industry into the valley."

Forget about the solid perfor-
mances turned in by the highly
touted and established bands
Journey and the Atlanta Rhythm
Section or the relatively unknown
group April Wine.

Forget about the skydivers who
glided dangerously close yet safe-
ly past the towers of arc lights on
their entertaining descent over
Rich football stadium.

And forget about the Italian
family of circus acrobats who
bounced and vaulted across the
stage while the stage crew busied
themselves preparing for the
main event.

This year's Fourth of July
festivities didn't kick off until the
Rolling Stones took the stage just
before 4:30 p.m.. Buffalo time.
Everything before was just a pic-
nic. a day of drinking and drug-
taking in the scattered sun.

To a welcome of electronic
trumpets blaring in decadent ma-
jesty and the release of hundreds
of red helium-filled baloons. the

' Stones stepped out front with their

cordless guitars and into a rous-
ing version of Chuck Berry's
“Johnny B. Goode."

The crowd — relaxed and largely
lounging up to this point — press-
ed forward toward the stage to
become a standing swarm of im-
penetrability extending at least 40
yards from it. The herd of 72.000
had come to feed and the Stones
tossed out a lean and tasty 90
minute morsel of their best sound
— both old and new.

Necks craned and people stood
on their toes for unbearably long
periods of time to catch glimpses
of lead singer Mick Jagger shar—
ing a chorus with guitarist Keith
Richard on the familiar “Honky
Tonk Woman" and “All Down the
Line." or to witness his playful
buggering of guitarist Ron Wood
during a crowd-inciting “Star
Star."

Then. their roots and past hits
selectively covered. the Stones
burst into the present. running
through all but two of the cuts
from their new album Some Girls.
Jagger re-donned a guitar he had
played on a couple of earlier

numbers to help out on slowed—
down but still rhythm-laden ren-
ditions of “Lies” and "When the
Whip Comes Down."

Jagger continued his short sim-
ple rhythm-enforcing licks on
guitar as the band moved through
what has become the set piece of
this tour. the disco-ish “Miss
You.“ But Jagger‘s guitar work
was just frill to his crooning as he
sang of a friend telling him about
“some Puerto Rican girls. jus‘
dyin' to mee-chyew."

As it was. the Stones sounded
best during the slower tempoed
ballads that showcased Jagger's
vocals and some lyrical guitar
work by Ron Wood.

The bluesy and seductive "Beast
of Burden." the soulful remake of
“imagination.” an old ’l‘emp-
tations hit. and the humorous
country tune “Faraway Eyes”
offering the added pleasures of
Jagger on piano and Wood on
pedal steel guitar.

But the key to the Stones perfor-
mance was their emphasis on
rhythm and ensemble playing
most evidentduring the playingof
“Shattered.”

\

Stones Keith Richard on rhythm
guitar. Charlie Watts on drums.
and Bill Wyman on bass plus
friends Stu Stewart and Ian
McLagen (formerly of the Faces)
on keyboards teamed for a highly
textured rhythmic backing as
Wood bit off terse. taut lead riffs to
Jagger's jiving street hustler‘s
perceptions of Manhattan. The
song suffered only from the lack of
backing vocals due to faulty
mikes.

’I‘o wrap up. the Stones did a
well-paced medley .of older
favorites including "Tumbling
Dice." "Love in Vain.“ Chuck
Berry's "Sweet Sixteen." “Happy”
and “Brown Sugar.“ The finale of

  
  
    

 

 

"Jumping Jack Flash“ left Jagger
not breathless butblowing kisses.

As usual. Jagger turned in an
athletic. if bawdy. performance.
Prancing about the huge stage —
an audacious out-take of the
Stones red lips and tongue logo —
he sported red leather jacket and
pants. and consistentdesire to fon-
dle his private parts. Alternately
caressing and challenging the
audience. Jagger proved himself
deft at dodgingthemissiles hurled
at him — Frisbees. footballs. and
plastic water containers. He took
his last bows -— elaborate
prostrations — at 6:58 p.111. There
was no encore.

 

Knockout Performance

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) ——- Guitarist Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones
was released from a local hospital less than 24 hours after fallingfrom a
stage following the group's performance here.

Wyman fell when he leaned against a stage curtain. thinking it was a
wall. Stones spokesman Paul Wasserman said. The guitarist hit his
head and was unconscious for about ten minutes. He suffered a chipped
knuckle. sprained wrist. and strained cartilage in two fingers.
