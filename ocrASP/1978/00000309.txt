ZODIAC NEWS

Allah Be Praised!

A Dutch inventor has come
out with a device for the
traveling sheik who has
everything—an automatic
Mecca-finder.

The Wall Street Journal
says that the compass-like
invention is engraved with the
names of 150 cities in Arabic.
The devout Moslem simply
turns the compass to the
north. twists the dial to the
name of the city he or sheisin,
and the arrow points the way
to Mecca. Devout Moslems
face towards Mecca when they
pray five times a day.

Baby Boom
The Christian Science
Monitor. in a review of a new
book. reports that there is
currently a black market in
white babies in the US. in

which prospective parents
will pay up to $50,000 for a
single infant.

The newspaper says there
are virtual underground baby
farms. consisting of dubious
agencies and foundations.
where unwed mothers
surrender their offspring
under legally meaningless
agreements for natal care that
is worth just a fraction of the
ultimate adoption price.

The Monitor says the reason
for the baby black market—
which replaced an abundance
of adoptable white babies just
a few years ago—is an
increase in birth control
use.the legalization of
abortions and the increasing
acceptance of unwed mothers
keeping their illegitimate
babies. All of this has created
a baby shortage. the
newspaper says.

Hey Tex

If you ever decide to move to
Texas. don't lose heart if you
just can't fathom all those
"foreign" texan mannerisms
and customs: now there's a
course you can enroll in which
teaches newcomers how to
live in Texas.

The course at Rice
University. called “Living
Texas." was designed by
native Texans Mary
Maclntyre and Linda Driskill.
and covers not only the
eccentric aspects of that huge
southwestern state. but also
teaches about Texas history.
ethnic groups. music. food and
wildlife. Maclntyre says the
course is aimed at “people
from the outside“ to teach
them about—in her words—"A
certain mythology to do with
Texas."

The course is apparently
catching on quite well.

Politicking Against Crime

 

July 20, 1978

 

Stiffer Penalties for Violent Crimes
By Juveniles and Repeat Adult Offenders

 

The Assembly's action came over objections that the
package was unduly harsh onjuveniles and could create
serious problems in the state's courts and prisons. it
followed on the heels of the Senate's nearly unanimous
approval of the package on a 50-2 vote in the early
morning hours.

The death penalty. which was the Legislature's
response to crime that dominated most of the regular
session but which was vetoed by Gov. Hugh Carey, is
not included in the cqnpromise package. But the crime
bill does require significantly stiffer penalties for violent
crimes by juveniles and repeat adult offenders.

(AP) —- In an unusual display of bipartisan solidarity, the Assembly gave final
passage yesterday to a broad anti-crime package politicians of both parties hope
will buttress their election-year credentials as crime-fighters. Capping months of
inconclusive bickering over dozens of proposals to crack down on crime, the
Assembly approved the package by an overwhelming margin of 125-10. “This is
just politics,” declared Assemblyman George Friedman, D-Bronx, in criticizing
how the package was put together. But he voted for it anyway.

penalty veto. was certain to sign the package into law
quickly. And he and legislators from both parties were
expected to start campaigning on the package almost
immediately.

“I'm grateful that the Republican crime proposals are
embodied in this bill," said Assembly Minority Leader
Perry Duryea, the Republican gubernatorial candidate,
striking the tone his party will take on the issue.

The harmonious agreement on the package was in
striking contrast to the squabbling that prevented
agreement over a general anti-crime package all
through the Legislature's regular session. Most of the
