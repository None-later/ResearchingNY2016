But at the start of this session, Carey,
Duryea, and the other legislative leaders
decided it was in all their best political
interests to have a negotiated agreement
that everyone would try to claim credit

for.

And although many legislators
privately expressed misgivings over
elements in the election-year package,
virtually everyone said publicly there was
a crying need for the action. Only once
before this year did the Legislature
exhibit such harmony. That was when
they voted for another popular campaign
issue — a $750 million cut in statetaxes.

“Only time will tell whether this will
truly be a deterrent to crime. But there is
no question in my mind that the people of
New York think this is the proper way to
go now,” declared Assemblyman
Howard Lasher, DrBrooklyn, in arguing
for the tough juvenile crime provisions.

The package is aimed at getting more
criminals off the streets and locked up in
jail for longer periods of time. Through its
restrictions on plea bargaining and its
mandatory minimum sentences, it will
limit the discretion of prosecutors and
judges to let offenders off without a
prison sentence or with a very light
sentence.

But in the process it will require more
trials in a court system which is already
considered overburdened. and put more
people in prisons which are already
overcrowded.

One key element of the package is the
requirement that juveniles accused ofthe
most serious crimes be tried in adult
courts and face adult sentences. That
requirement alone is expected to send
over 1,000 additional cases into the adult
criminaljustice system, where there is an
average delay of one year between arrest
and trial.

Prominent legal groups and a handful
of legislators have warned that the
package’s provisions could create havoc
in the courts and prisons.

Carey and his Democratic allies have
proposed $70.7 million in additional state
spending this year to finance two new
courts, the construction of additional
space in juvenile and adult prisons to hire

additional prosecutors.

And in another anti-crime gesture, the
Democrat-controlled Assembly
approved the spending bill yesterday
shortly after passing the crime package.

But the spending bill must still be
negotiated with the Republican-
controlled Senate. When the legislative
leaders agreed to pass the crime bills,
they also agreed to recess the current
session after that action and not come
back to Albany to take up other issues —
including the spending bill —-- until
August.

Under the crime package, longer
mandatory prison terms will face those
who commit any of a new category of
crimes known as “violent felonies."
Included in that category are attempted
murder, kidnapping, arson,
manslaughter, rape, sodomy and serious
assaults, burglaries and robberies.

Second-time offenders will face longer
sentences and third-time offenders will be
subject to a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.

Juveniles who commit murder will face
a maximum term of life imprisonment,
while juveniles convicted of serious
felonies will face prison terms slightly
shorter than adult terms.

Juveniles

Any 13-, 14- or 15vyearvold accused of
murder could be tried in the adult
criminal courts and face a maximum term
of life imprisonment.

A 14- or 15-year-old charged with
kidnapping, manslaughter, rape,
sodomy, arson, burglary or robbery may
also betried in the adult courts and face
adult terms.

Criminal court judges will have limited
power to transfer a juvenile charged in
such crimes back into the Family Court
system.

Currently, all teen-agers under 16 who
are arrested for a crime are handled by
the Family Court system, where all the
proceedings are closed to the public and
are conducted without juries. The
maximum sentence for any crime 7 7 no
matter how serious v- is five years of
confinement, of which only 18 months
must be served in a prison-like “secure”
facility.

As memories of a tumultuous period
marked by program cuts and faculty
retrenchments linger, a new union is
vying for the statewide representation of
16,200 SUNY employees. 1

The New York Educators
Association/National Educators
Association recently concluded a 4-
month petition drive that netted some
5,300 signatures — enough to call for a
representation election through the
state Public Employment Relations
Board.

“We are expecting an election," said
John Milton, director of communications
for the incumbent United University
Professions union. “But there’s no way
NEA can win * they know it, and we
know it."

“That’s what they (UUP) said about
our getting enough signatures for the
election," said NYEA spokesman Mike

recommended a one year moratorium on

I A spokesman for the Albany County
Planning Board said that 1200 acres of
the Pine Bush are already slated for
preservation, including the primary
habitat of the endangered Karner blue
butterﬂy, north of the NYS Thruway.

Opponents of the mall also contend
that the area is simply not big enough to
sustain a shopping area of that size. They
claim that Crossgates will only take
business away from downtown Albany
and the Colonie Center/Northway Mall
area.

An economist speaking for Strong at
Tuesday night's hearing said that there is
a gap in the spending of people in the
Capital District and the nationalaverage,
a gap which Crossgates would close.

Villano. “We overturned that
prediction.”
The ballot would offer the SUNY
employees the options of staying with
UUP, changing over to NYEA/NEA, or
having no representation. State law
mandates that one option draw more
than 50 per cent of the vote to win.
Otherwise, there must be a runoff
between the two top vote-getters.
Villano said that out of 1195 eligible f ull-
time SUNYA employees, 631 signed
cards calling for an election. The
percentage of SUNYA employees
favoring the election was considerably
higher than the statewide percentage.
Milton said the election could result in

a runoff which might incline SUNY.

employees to opt for no representation at
all. “I think they're (NYEA/NEA) hoping
to have us blown-out," he said. “That's
their only hope. Then they can come back

town of Guilderland, where the bulk of
the mall would be located; the attraction
of people from as far as Saratoga County,
“maybe farther," pumping their dollars
into the local economy; and the
employment opportunities offered by the
six major department stores, eight

theatres, 20 restaurants, and 100 smaller
shops the mail will contain.

Strong has already received approval
from the Albany County Planning Board.
The Guilderland Town Board is expected
to vote on the rezoning next week.

employees. Villano cited what he called a
“loosely formulated retrenchment clause
that allows the administration todefine it
at will." This, he said, facilitated the layoff
of tenured faculty during SUNYA’s
program reorganization under President
Emmett B. Fields in March 1976.

NYEA/NEA contends that SUNY
employees are losing money because pay
hikes have failed to keep up with
increases in the cost-of-living.

UUP President Sam Wakshull this
month announced a wage settlement for
SUNY employees providing for an
immediate general increase of six and a
half percent, followed by a general
increase of one and a half percent next
March 1, plus a discretionary additional
one percent. The settlement was
overwhelmingly ratified by UUP
members.

Villano said NYEA/NEA officials are
confident their union will win, partly
because the sour taste of retrenchment
still weighs heavily in the judgment of
many employees, especially at hard-hit

ﬂivol Union Challenges SUN? Representation

campuses like SUNYA.

“It’s a combination of UUP’s failure to
negotiate a decent salary settlement and
its failure to do anything about
retrenchment,” said Villano.

“We feel that we’ll win," said Milton,
“NEA apparently feels that they can be
the spoilers.” The SUNY administration
would be glad not to have to renegotiate
another contract if neither union wins,
he added.

NYEA/NEA expects PERB will
schedule the election for October or
November, after the petition cards are
submitted in August. Under state law,
NYEA/NEA needed signatures showing
interest from 30 percent of the members
of the bargaining unit to force an election,
or about 4800 signatures.

UUP is affiliated with the New York
State United Teachers and the two-
million member state AFL-ClO. The
union represents teaching and non-
teaching professionals employed in the
SUNY system.
