new contraceptive suppository especially
popular on college campuses and among
teen-agers were sharply criticized by the
Food and Drug Administration on
Wednesday for promoting it as 99 per
cent effective in preventing pregnancy.

The only contraceptive that effective is
the birth-control pill, the agency’said.

Encare Oval, a vaginal suppository
that effervesces into a spermicide foam,
probably is 71 per cent to 98 per cent
effective, like other contraceptive foams
and gels,_the FDA said. The rate depends
upon how carefully women follow

The contraceptive’s maker, Norwich
Eden Pharmaceuticals of Norwich, N.Y.,
had claimed on its label that two studies
in» West Germany “ indicated the
pregnancy rate for women using Encare
Oval was “1 per 100 woman years.” An
FDA advisory committee said the studies
were poorly conducted and unreliable,

The agency sent a drug bulletin to one
million doctors, pharmacists and other
health professvnals Wednesday telling
them that Encare Oval had been
“overpromoted.”

The bulletin said the “99 per cent
efficacy claims for Encare Oval have led

to inflated popular expectations for the
product, and its failure rate is probbaly
higher than one per cent."

Encare Oal, like other foams and gels,
contains the spermicide, nonoxynol-9,
which can kill sperm on contact. Encare
Oval has been sold in Europe for six years
and distribution in the United States
began last November, with one market
research group estimating that over a
half-million American women are using it.

Under prodding from the FDA, the
manufacturer voluntarily changed its
labeling in April to drop mention of the
West German studies. '

The company issued a statement
saying Encare Oval, "because it is
convenient and easy‘ to use properly, is
a highly reliable contraceptive."

“It has been a welcome addition to the
list of nonhormonal contraceptives
according to responses we have received ‘
from satisfied women and their
physicians all over the country," it said.

The FDA considers the pill morethan
99 per cent effective, while intrauterine
devices are 94 to 99 per cent effective.
But both those methods carry more
physical risks for women than foams and
gels.

As if to underscore that point, the
same FDA drug bulletin revealed the
agency’s plan to warn women of a new
risk in using lUDsnThe FDA said it will
change the label on lUDs to warn users
that they are three to five times more
likely to develop pelvic inﬂammatory
disease.

The FDA said it was speaking out
about Encare Oval not because it
considers foams or gels a poor
contraceptive method, but because it
does not want “inflated popular
expectations" to undermine confidence
in them.

FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy
said the effectiveness claims for
contraceptives "must be supported by
sound scientific evidence. Otherwise,
people will have unrealistic expectations
of what the products can do and
unwanted pregnancies will result.”

Kennedy added, “Encare Oval appears
to be especially popular on college
campuses and among teenagers."

‘Live'

 

Bill Sobel

It's about 11:15 on adull Saturday night
in Albany and your best buddy, whose off
campus apartment is equipped wit h cable
television, has gone home for the
weekend. You run to your suite, pick up
the old portable TV with the broken
handle and run like hell to the tower
penthouse. You quickly set it up, moving
the broken antenna back and fort h until a
distant image of the Channel 2
weatherman giving Sunday’s forecast for
Utica becomes as close to clear as
possible. Relief, you can now sit back with
a six of Molson and enjoy a snowy signal
that detracts from the antics of “The Not
Ready for Prime Time Players," simply
because the local NBC affiliate refuses to
broadcast it. Or do they? .‘
Well, the news looks good indeed! As
of late June, “Saturday Night Live" has

town, cable or no, thanks to he NBC
affiliate in the Capital District, WRGB,
Channel 6 in Schenectady.

But why the wait? Why put us st udents
through such audio/visual turmoil?
James Delmonico, general manager of
WRGB, summed it up by sayingthat the
show was primarily kept off the air for
financial purposes. Being an NBC
network program running during local
station time (after 11 pm, on Saturday
night), WRGB felt that there was more
money to make in advertising by running
in old movies and thereby collecting all
the money on the advertising themselves.
“Saturday Night" on the other hand,
includes over 50 per cent commercial
time from which NBC network makes
money.

Why did WRGB make the change?
“Recently we were able to work out an
arrangement with NBC that was a little
bit more satisfactory to our station,"
explaned Delmonico. "A much better

deal than when the show first appeared

Delmonico went on to say that WRGB
is currently in what the trade describes as
“a rating period." This is the time that a
stations popularity is evaluated and
calculated to determine how many
viewers a station has at any given time.
Ratings are done for many reasons, but
primarily because the more viewers a
station has the more money they can
charge in advertising. Therefore,
according to WRGB, now is a good time

whose death brought the statement,
“Gee, we never really knew him." Now
Peck sees a new suicidal group, more

it does, even though WRGB has been
number one in that time slot period
anyway.

“ ‘Saturday Night' itself is just a start,"
said WRGB Program Manager Terry
Walden. “In addition to the show’s antics,
we’ll be following the show locally [on
Channel 6 only] with what we’re calling

which will include anything from old

including users of drugs and alcohol.
. Peck and others believe a big factor in
their inability to cope is confused child
rearing. “Years ago, when parents were
consistent in teaching values and
discipline, children knew where they
stood. Today, parents are confused
about their own roles and don’t know
whether to be a disciplinarian or a best
friend,” he said. “Yet kids need
something not rigid but stable."
