The Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration has revealed that is
used information trom U.$. va
satel'ites to track down and seize 40
ocean-going vessels trying to xuggle
marijuana into the US. under a
secret operation code named,
"Stopgap."

The Washington Post reports
that ships carrying marijuana to the
U.S. from Columbia, Mexico,
enezuela, Honduras, Panama and
Liberia were identified by under-
cover agents in those countries and
then tracked by satellities from
December of '1977 to April of 1978,
resulting in the seizure of 1,150,000
pounds of pot valued at $400 million.

The Post says that the DEA was
able to seize the ships outside of
US. territorial waters because of
arrangements made ahead of time
between the US. State Department
and the countries whose llags the
ships flew.

The newspaper quotes DliA ad-
ministrator Peter Bensuiger as say-
ing, “Stopgap is one of the most
successful operations We've ever
had in stopping the flow of narcotics
into the US."

Bensinger said that as a result of
Stopgap. the price of niaiuuana in
Columbia went Irom $20.1 pound to
as much as $80 because the [low ol
pot tmthe U.S. was tot he at least
one-third.

Nose Knows

if your nose is. stopped up, maybe
you're aroused.

Sherri California researcher Doc~
tor Vernon Gray says that, "it's a
well-known fact thathhe nose tends
to stop up when people are erotically
or sexually stimulated. We used to
call it ‘Honeymoon Nose,‘ although
that may be a term that is nolonger
valid in today's world."

According to the doctor, erotic
stimulation causes the blood vessels
in the nose to di$late,whch,inturn,
blocks the air passageways. As a
result. says Gray. being turned on
can leave you breathless

Hard Push

Women who give birth naturally
using the Lamaze Method of
prepared childbirth have fewer and
less serious complications than
mothers who use more traditioal
delivery methods,

This is the conclusion of a study
conducted by Doc t oi Michael
Hughey at the livanston l lospital in
Illinois, comparing 500 Lamaze
births with 500 deliveries involving
women who gave birth by other
means.

Dctor Hughey reports that is
study found that Lamaze mothers
experience only one third the
number ol cases of toxemia in
pregnancy; ()HC'llllKl the amount of
post-delivery infection; one-fourth

the amount of fetal distress as
women w 0 had their babies using
traditional types of delivery.

in the Lamaze Method, the father
is present in the delivery room. In ad-
dition, both parents undergo taining
in breathing control and other
techniques to assist a woman's
natural muscular action while she is
in labor. Lamaze mothers also use
fewer pain-killing drugs.

hile most of the attention given
to the struggles against the proliferation
of nuclear power has been centered
about the Seabrook installation, the
possibility of such an installation within
twenty miles of SUNYA, in the nearby
town of Stuyvesant, has become a very
real, if yet unheralded, threat.

“At present the utilities and the Power
Authority of the State of New York are
seeking to make New York one of the
major nuclear generating sites in the

Northeastern United States," said Dick
Got in an article written for Nuclear
Power and its Alternatives. According to
Got, the utilities have united to form the
Empire State Power Resources, inc,
with “the sole purpose of building power
plants among the state's seven investor
owned utilities."

According to ESPRl, New York is
scheduled to have fifteen new power
plants ready for the late 1980’s and early
19905. How then did Stuyvesant become

one of the Projected sites? J
