You hear the same story over and over
again. Nothing to do so you sit in your
room, turn on the old boob tube and
watch the same old garbage reruns and
sitcoms. The worst part of it is that
there’s only three outlets for it in Albany,
Channels 6, 10 and 13, and therefore you
see the same junk again and again. But

- honestly now, how often have you tuned

took a look at the programming offered
by Channel 17? For those of you who are
I unfamiliar, WMHT/ 17 is the Capital
District Public Television outlet, and their
programming can be described simply as
“an alternative."

Music is an excellent place to start, and
classical and jazz are two of the best
music forms known to man. But how
often have you seen them performed on
the commercial networks? Maybe “The
Nutcracker" around Christmas time or
George Benson on “The Midnight
Special." But believe it or not, jazz and
classical music are seen on Public TV on
a regular weekly basis. The classical
programs on Channel 17 include “Great

Performances" and “Evening at the
Pops," on which you can see anything
from the New York Philharmonic live
frotn Lincoln Center to the Boston Pops
performing with Glen Campbell.

Jazz music is also seen regularly with
shows like “At the Top" and “Live from
the Wolf Trap." Just to give you an idea,
this summer’s offerings range from“The
New England Ragtime Ensemble" (Aug.
1) all the way to "Chuck Mangione Live at
the Wolf Trap (Aug. 24)."

WMHT’S other programming also
brings you an alternative. Classic flllllS
are seen weekly, such as Sir Lawrence
Olivier in “As You Like it" (July 29).
Other programs of interest include old
Edward R. Murrow “Person to Person"
interviews from the 505 such as
Groucho and Harpo Marx (Aug, 11).
reruns of the old “Prisoner” set’iesandfot‘
those of you who have that desire to keep
up with the Governor and the
Legislature, Dave Hepp and Peg Green
keep you well informed on "inside
Albany.”

50, next time you're getting ready to
throw eggs at the Brady Bunch or blow
up the Love Boat, tune in Channel 17
You may be surprised.

northwestern Columbia County and be
situated one-fifth of a mile from the Hud-
son River, about 15 miles south of the city
of Albany. Over 800,000 people live
within a 25-mile radius of the proposed
plant.

One hundred acres of the site would be
devoted to administrative buildings.
access roads, cooling towers and two
1250 megawatt pressurized water were
tors. The remaining land would be a
protective buffer for the plant. The water
used in the reactor would be supplied by
the Hudson River and the power Would
be transmitted over the controversial 765
kv power lines. One of the nuclear reac-
tors is scheduled to be in service in 1988
with the other starting up in 1990. Es
timated cost of the project is $3.2billion.

Stuyvesant power plant proponents
cite such positive aspects of the propos-
ed area as the fact that only twu per cent
of Stuyvesants's total land area is
presently being used for residential pur
poses, which is a major factor since
Federal and state regulations stress a need
for low population in the immediate vicini-
ty of a reactor.

Another strong point according to the
plant’s supporters is the proximity to the
Hudson River, which is ideal in terms of
supplying the facility with water for
generating and cooling purposes as well
as a means of transporting Construction
material and fuel to the plants. Transpor-
tation is also feasible by railroad.

In August of 1976, preliminary studies
were conducted in the Stuyvesant area,
including what the NYSEG newsletter
called “extensive environmental
research which is necessary to support

an application for construction permis-

sion.” The studies were conducted by
outside firms who specialize in a par-
ticular type of analysis.

The utilities are required to submit, ac- -

cording to the NYSEG, “extensive data
about the two sites (Stuyvesant and New
Haven) and must name one a preferred
site and the other as an alternate loca-
tion. The application will then be filed
with the State Board on Environmental
Siting and the Environment, who then
conducts public hearings and ultimately
makes the decision on where the plant
will be located.

The Siting Board also makes the final
decision as to whether the plant will be a
nuclear station or a coal-fired plant.
Although NYSEG and LlLCO have no in—
tentions of building a coal plant, during
April of 1978 they had to conduct studies
to access the feasibility of three 850
megawatt coal units as an alternative to
building a nuclear unit. This data was
necessary for the application so that the
Siting Board can make a valid com—
parison between nuclear and coal
generation.

The headline of April issue of the
Hudson-Register Star read “Oswego
County Chosen for A-Plant.” The town
of New Haven was named the prime site
for the proposed generating station with
Stuyvesant as its alternate site.

It is now up to the Siting Board to make
its decision and grant the authority to
build the facility. In the meantime, the
utilities plan to establish acommunityad-
visory program at both New Haven and
Stuyvesant to study the impact construc-

Seabrook Sequel Simmers at

tion would have on these localities and
how it can be lessened. Site data will con
tinue to be gathered in Stuyvesant until at
least October. One reason given for
choosing New Haven over Stuyvesant
was that the New Haven site would be
less sensitive to environmental impact
associated with building and operating
the power plant. In making their decision
the board also considered the visual im-
pact and ecological aspects. However the
utility spokesman pointed out that both
New Haven and Stuyvesant are satisfac-
tory siteC and will be submitted to State
and Federal agencies for consideration.

The utilities plan to submit their en-
vironmental reports by the end of Oc-
tober of this year and file a preliminary
safety analysis report with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) based on

Mary Ann Hovak

the New Haven site. However, the
utilities plan to file additional reports with
the NRC in February, 1979 to cover the
environmental and safety aspects of the
Stuyvesant plant. The joint federal and
state hearings would then begin in the fall
of 1979 and the construction permits
issued in 1981. Construction of the first
1250 megawatt units would begin in 1982.

Concerned Citizens for Safe Energy
chairperson, Anne Curtain, said, "Alter-
nate sites aren't shelved," referring to
another case when the alternative site
was ultimately selected over the prime
site. “This just puts Stuyvesant in limbo
for a number of years."

The fight to preserve the agricultural
region of Stuyvesant and bar the con-
struction of the nuclear facility is far from
being over. Environmentalists have join-
ed the struggle to determine if the area
which would be affected by the plant sup-
ports any species which is on the verge of
extinction, since Federal law forbids the
undertaking of projects that would
destroy the “critical habitat" of an en»
dangered species.

It has been determined that the short-
nosed sturgeon, an endangered species

    

of fish which dates back to prehistoric
times, spawns in the Hudson River near
Stuyvesant. Research is being conducted
to determine the extent of the spawning
ground and the potential impact on the
eggs, larvae and juveniles of the species.
if the studies shed conclusive evidence of
the further endangerment of the
sturgeon due to the operating of a
generating plant. the evidence will he
entered at the application hearinc and
could block the construction at Stuyve
sant.

The cooling towers, which would be
implemented in the Stuyvesant plant,
would eliminate some of the problems
associated with thermal pollution but
may have some serious drawbacks of
their own. The towers are designed to
allow the cooling water being circulated
through a plant to fall through a draft
where the heat is removed by evapora»
tion. The Stuyvesant cooling towers will
release 160,000 tons of water vapor into
the air daily. Water vapor emitted into the
atmosphere can cause increased humidi-
ty, fogging, icing, snowing and unfore-
seen crop effects.

Another problem associated with the
cooling towers was uncovered by the
New York State Department of En-
vironmental Conservation which found
that PCBs Would be distributed to the air
and soil around the proposed nuclear
plant at Cementon (about 20 miles south
of Stuyvesant also on the Hudson River)
through the normal operation of the
plant's two cooling towers. Carried along
with the water used for cooling, the
PCB’s would leave the towers along with
the water vapor. PCB molecules are con-
sidered to be cancer causing agents and,
although they would not affect t he plant’s
employees directly, they may concen-
trate in the soil around the plant.

The NRC, at the urging of the En-
vironmental Protection Agency, requires
that cooling towers be built at nuclear
power plant sites. These towers can be
300 feet or more in diameter at the base
and up to 500 feet tall. This would be an

eyesore at any location but would be in
dramatic contrast to the pastoral area of
Stuyvesant.

Locating an electrical generating plant
at Stuyvesant would promote the
necessity of the mammoth 765 kv power
lines to cross Columbia County. The
lines require steel towers 200 feet high
and 'a 350 foot wide land corridor. This
Would consume over 1000 acres of
Columbia's prime farm land, interfere
with radio and television reception, and
have biological effects on humans and
animals that have not been fully in-
vestigated.

Proponents of the Stuyvesant plant
point to the employment increase and tax
benefits that the utilities have promised.
Estimated of 2300 construction workers
at the peak of construction as well as a
$675 million total payroll over the ten
years it will take to construct the plant,
have made the idea of a nuclear facility
more appealing to many local citizens.
However, it is often not realized that
most of the work will be done by large
specialized contractors, such as Stone
and Weber Engineering Corporation of
Boston in the case of the Stuyvesant
plant.

The most considerable economic
benefit would be derived from the large
increase in the tax base provided by utili-
ty payments. As most utilities build their
own service roads, provide their own
sewer and water hook-ups. security and
fire protection they would be making few
demands of public services. Also, realesv
late taxes drop when a power plant
locates in a community. The drawback to
these apparent advantages is that much
of the increased revenue must go to im-
provement and maintenance of roads
and highWays that have depreciated due
to the increase in commuter and heavy
construction equipment traffic, and to in-
crease school and public facilities for the
temporary construction population.

To date, the utilities have spent ten
million dollars researching the Stuyve-
