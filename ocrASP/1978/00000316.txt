it was almost a decade ago that Laura
Nyro reached the peak of her popularity.
The success of the albums More Than
Just A New Discovery (now First Songs)
and Eli and the Thirteenth Confession
quickly established Ms. Nyro as an ex-
traordinary talent. Several of her songs
became hits for a variety of artists
(“Stoney End,” “And When i Die,"
"‘Sweet Blindness,” "Eli’s Coming”) yet
Nyro's own style was not as popularly
accepted. Her raw, emotive vocals and
powerful, often unfocused arrangements
were not as palatable as the more tuneful

Top 40 adaptations. After releasing a
number of albums to strong praise as well
as pointed criticism, and attracting a
sizeable, dedicated following, a dis-
gruntled Laura Nyro disappeared from
the music scene.

After almost six years, she revemerged
late in 1975 with the album Smile. One of
the finest albums of the year, Smile show—
cased Nyro’s talent in a different light.
The versatile, passionate quality of her
voice emerged fully in the understated
vocals, subtle harmonies, and soft folk-
jazz backgrounds and arrangements.
Nyro’s voice was emotive and moving
without being overbearing, and the
album stands among the finest in its
genre.

She followed the album with a national
tour, accompanied by a jazz-rock band
featuring John Tropea, among others.
Delayed by much ado from her record
company, Season of Lights, an excep-
tional live album recorded during the
tour, was released last summer. Selec-
tions on the album range from her early
“hits” to her most intense work, each
musically and even lyrically reinter-
preted, in a way that is both more accessi-
ble and more meaningful. On the album,
as on the tour, Nyro is powerful without

sant site. Seven monitoring stations and
three towers were erected to gather
meteorological and aquatic information.
NYSEG site supervisor feels that “it is
very likely that if someone else wanted to
build a plant here they could do so. But
they‘d have to go through the same licen-
sing procedure we’re starting here and
that takes a long time.”

So it seems that if Stuyvesant is not
chosen to be the location for NYSEG and
LlLCO's plant, it may one day support
a generating facility anyway. Those that
see this forecast, and are not ardent op-
posers of nuclear energy, propose that.
local action should advocate
precautionary measures which include:
passage of local laws which limit or
restrict radioactive transport on certain
roadways, prohibit land burial of wastes
in the town, require that radioactive
wastes be cared for by federal agencies,
and assure full compensation in the event
of an accident. Also, they propose a

overwhelming (“The Confession,"
“Money”), and expressive without
overstating (“Timer," “Emmie"). The
album is a major success as both an ex-
pansion of her newer, more melodic
style, and as a redefinition of her earlier
work. _

Last month. Laura Nyro released her
third album since her return to the music
scene, Nested. Though she is six months
pregnant, she is accompanying its release
with a brief tour that stopped at Central
Park for the Dr. Pepper Music Festival
Saturday night. Despite the worst
weather New York has seen since its
January blizzard (96 degrees' total
humidity and unhealthy air), Nyro gave a
performance true to the high quality of
her recent work. She mixed deeply affec-
ting vocals with strong piano work (she is
unaccompanied on this tour) to produce
a sound as vivid as her studio work.

The concert began in disappointing
fashion with an unannounced first act,
Bryon Bowers. Bowers, accompanying
himself on autoharp, played for almost an
hour to the groans of a sweltering crowd
who had come to the 6:30 show expec-
ting only Nyro. Many found themselves
sitting with tickets to the 8:30 Crosby,
Stills and Nash concert at Madison
Square Garden burning their pockets, as
Bowers ate away at their plans to see
both shows back to back. Despite the
fact that his unannounced addition tothe
show did not endear him to this group of
fans, his performance was largely un-
distinguished, with the possible excep-
tion of one moving song about prison
reform.

To the further dismay of the crowd, a
thoroughly unnecessary 45-minute inter-
mission followed Bowers‘ performance.
Finally, at 8 pm, Ms. Nyro appeared,
and opened with two new songs,
"Rhythm and Blues," and “Mr. Blue," the
latter about a lover who will not see her
because “Honey, l've heard of liberation,

A Sequel to Seabrook

detailed plan of notification and evacua-
tion of residents in case of an accident
and that police and fire companies
become educated and equipped to han-
dle the type ofemergency that may result
at a nuclear power plant.

in the late 1960’s, when Stuyvesant
planners were taking preliminary steps

toward adopting zoning regulation, a sur~ ‘

vey of the townspeople was conducted
and if indicated that the majority wished
Stuyvesant to remain a rural agricultural
community. Certainly, the construction
and operation of a 2500 megawatt
generating facility with a projected worth
of over $3 billion would have enormous
impact on such a town. However, the
depletion of our fossile fuel reserves and
the economic and industrial structure of
the Northeastern United States will con-
tinue to apply pressure on communities
such as Stuyvesant as well as on the
utilities to weigh the potential good and
evil of nuclear power plants to meet grow-
ing energy demands.

Laura Nyro’s Triumphant Return to Music

but you're in outer space."

The focus of the concert is the new
album, Nested, from which she per-
formed eight songs. Though not as softly
expressive as Smile, nor as musically
complex as Season of Lights, Nested is
another triumph for Nyro. By far her
most listenable record to date, she blends
her riff-laden musical and lyrical styles
with tight production and instrumenta-
tion. The album is more musically upbeat
than much of her work, and her ex-
pressive vocal ability is at its high point.
She interprets her own material ex-
ceedingly well - she can be sensual and
wistful in “Springblown” and “Mr. Blue,"
bitter and resentful in “My innocence"
and “Crazy Love," and satirically
protesting in "American Dreamer."

As enjoyable as the show was, Nyro
can perhaps be faulted for her choice of

some material. What makes Nested such
a fine album is its instrumentation, and
barren of this, songs such as "Light" and
“Rhythm and Blues" do not come off well.
Furthermore, songs such as “Sexy
Mama" and “Mr. Blue." underscored on
the record by vague, soft guitar work lose
a step when done on piano. However,
Nyro’s vocal talent and ﬂexibility over-
came any gaps left by the limited musical
background.

Since her return to recording three
years ago, Laura Nyro has created a new
style for herself that is much more satisfy-
ing than most of her early work. Three ar-
tistically successful albums have re-
established Ms. Nyro as one ofthe more
creative female vocalists around today,
and her performance this week was a
statement of individual talent that few
could equal.

You really don't understand. it's not
just the punch line. Some of them don't
even have a punch line. Maybe “funny”
isn't the right word.

But it's like this. Here i am sitting at a
table with the woman of my dreams
wondering if I should put my arm around
her or take her hand (but if she makes no
response, do I draw away or dol wait until
it’s time to take another sip of wine?) And
what are we doing? We're watching this
guy sitting with the girl of his dreams
wondering whether or not he should put
his arm around her . . .

You know that feeling? All of ti sudden
you see too much of yourself on that
stage over there and begin to l'L'dlIZt! how
absurd these little games really tire . . .
it's the basis of Feif‘er’s Work. The l'CtlSLHl

that there is really only one city, would
cry out that Feilfer is above all urban, and
to appreciate him you must he possessed
of an urban sensibility. They may be right,
for in a sense honesty is so much more
difficult in the complexities of city life,
where everyone walks and talks like Jill
Clayburgh's unmarried woman and
sincerity is seen as the most insidious
form of dishonesty.

So Feilfer’s characters are people who
poniificate on the meaninglessness of a
world where guilt is the reigning
emotional state i and then feel guilty
about it. Guilt, you see, is the primary by-
product of both honesty and dishonesty.
Guilt is something we are all guiiiy of.

dirty, but feels guilty about enjoying it
because everyone says that sex is clean.
And not just everyone. Psychiatrists tell
us that sex is clean. But they've lied to us;

you're in love then it won't matter since
you've beaten the system anyway.

Feiffer's people. however, don't beat
the system. Witness the young woman
who refuses the advances oi her would

herself that she is a threat to his
masculinity. Or the depressed couple
who wonder if it all began when Star Trek
was taken off the air. Or the man who
