The American Friends Service
Committee is charging that the FBI
,from 1930 to 1976 and possibly
continuing to the present, has
- maintained a list of Americans to be
rounded up and placed in detention
camps in case of a "national
emergency."

The committee says that
government documents it has
obtained under the Freedom of
information Act reveal that the US.
Bureau of Prisons has set aside six
detention centers to be used to hold
targeted individuals at a moment's
notice.

According to the newly-released
documents, the round-up list hit an
allAtime high of 26,174 persons in
1954 during the Joseph McCarthy
ears, and totaled 1294 in 1975.

Says Ken Lawrenceof the Friends
Committee, “The purpose was to
identify individuals considered the
most dangerous to the government
so that in the event of a ‘national
emergency' they could be placed in
designated camps which could be
instantly readied to receive them."

Strapped
If you're a little on the plump side
and are considering purchasing a
car, you'd better think twice about
buying a Saab.
The Swedish newspaper Dagens

 

ZODIAC NEWS

Nyheter is reporting that the safety
belts in the 1974 Saab 99 are too
short and a bit too tight for fat
Americans.

To accomodate heavy-set U.S.
drivers, Saab has reportedly
installed longer, more comfortable
seat belts in its later models. if you
have a strong penchant for 1974
Swedish cars, however, maybe
you'd better lose weight——or try a
Volvo.

Deep End
Now that summertime is upon
us, an Austrian psychiatrist is
warning that vacations often trigger
psychological and emotional
breakdowns.

Doctor Heinz Brokop says that
the new environment, boredom or
let-downs following vacation
planning can send fragile
personalities over the brink.

Brokop reports that the most
common vacation crackup occurs
among persons who travel by
themselves. He says that they get off
by themselves, begin to re-evaluate
their lives and don't like what they
find.

Another common problem is for
couples who vacation together.
Brokop says that they findwith their
daily responsibilities left behind, life
is no better than before and perhaps
even worse. This, he says, leads to
an increase in fighting, breakups
and serious mental depression.

A Growing Sound for Albany

Ozone Revenge

New Times magazine reports that
those aerosol spray cans which offer
“ new environmental formulas" can
explode, seriously injuring or even
killing spray can users.

According to the magazine, the
aerosol industry has rushed out with
new “hydrocarbon” propellants—
using butane, isobutane or
propane—to replace the
fluorocarbon propellants which
threatened the Earth's ozone layer.

The magazine says, however, that
the new mixtures are extremely
volatile. Since 1973, the Consumer
lroduct Safety Commission has
compiled reports showing that more
than 350Americans have been killed
and at least 20,000 injured in spray
can accidents.

Booze Wins

The annual survey by the
government's National Institute on
Drug Abuse concludes that as of the
end of last year, 25 per cent of all
Americans over the age of 12 have
smoked pot.

The survey found that more than
42 million Americans have smoked
the illicit weed at least once,and that
more than 16millionAmericansaor
10 per cent of the population over
12u-are “current users" of "grass".

in terms of drug use, however,
alcohol was way out in front. The
government says that three in every
tour Americans over 12 have tried
booze, while nearly two in three
have smoked tobacco.

1 was driving back from Troy, rushing toward Loudonville, site of my
latest reporting assignment, whenl saw a station wagonfull of nuns driv—
ing over a sea gull that had flown onto the Congress Street Bridge. I felt
a twinge of regret as l sped past the red and white blob, for during the
last five minutes 1 had grown close to that gull in a strange way.

1 had been stuck at the traffic light on Route 7 when 1 first saw him, fly-
ing high above, searching the Hudson. Suddenly, the gull broke into
what seemed a plummeting dive destined to end in death. “Pullout, pull
out you stupid PCB-sniffing bird," l silently screamed.

At the last moment, the gull, in a breathtaking motion, leveled off and
skimmed the surface of the water. Suddenly, it dipped beneath the
water and emerged triumphantly with a fish. “Ah, nature's predators in
action," I smiled, full of admiration for my feathered friend.

Suddenly, a gust of wind disturbed the gull and the fishfell, landing on
the bridge. With a cry ofanguish, the gull swooped down, landing inches
from the fish. As he recovered the fish, lremember thinking, “Wow, this
is something that Cecil B. DeMill movies are made of. The struggle to
obtain that which is precious, only to lose it, then only to recover it once
again." Sometimes I can be very melodramatic.

Yes, this is St. Agnes'. No, it ’s not the new SUNYA dorm.

So it pained me somewhat as i watched the gull, who could have been
as big as Charlton Heston, being crushed under the wheels of a Y66
Rambler. Ah, the hell with it. I had a story to write.

1 soon reached my destination. A dirt road just off of the intersection
of l 90 and Route 9 in Loudonville, The road sign proclaimed it the en-
trance to the St. Agnes campus, and somewhere on that campus was
Pittman Hall, new home for 75 SUNYA transfer students this fall.

The brochure issued by the university described St. Agnes as con-
sisti ng of “36 acres of rolli ng meadows, wooded areas, picnic grounds,"
with a “panoramic view of t he Hudson River Valley, the Berkshires, and
surrounding areas." Looking around the bleak place i thought that
maybe the university had hired the guy who used to writ e real estate ads
for Death Valley.

“it’s an overcast day,"l rationalized. 1 told myselfit would turnout to ,
