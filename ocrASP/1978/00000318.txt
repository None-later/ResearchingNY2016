ON THE AIR

Anchoring the News in Realism

 

For many years the concept behind the
evening television network newscast has
been to have an anchor in New York
and/or Washington with correspondents
around the nation and worldwide. ABC
News, looking to boost their ratings, has
taken a close look at themselves and the
other network news programs, and has
come up with an alternative called:
"World News Tonight."

With anchor Frank Reynolds in
Washington covering National news, a
foreign desk in London headed by Peter

Bill Sobel

Jennings, a domestic desk in Chicago
with Max Robinson and Barbara Walters
at the Special Coverage desk in New
York, ABC‘s president of news and
sports Roone Arledge announced the
change was made because he wanted his
newspeople as close to the news as possi-
ble.

“There's been too much studio jour-
nalism in the news business," said
Arledge. “We feel we can give the viewer
a much better understanding of the news

 

 

 

through a greater involvement in the
story on location.”

Arledge also feels that mobility is im-
portant and to do this the four principal
reporters (Reynolds, Jennings, Robinson
and Walters) on many occasions will be
out in the field themselves.

Executives at WTEN, the ABC affiliate
here in Albany, also seem excited about
“World News Tonight." General
Manager Terrance McGuirk said the
program is one of the best news shows of
its type he’s ever seen. “It really moves
well, and Reynolds is a real pro."

In addition to the four principal
anchors, Howard K. Smith will continue
his regular commentary from
Washington and ABC has plans to add a
west coast desk in Los Angeles at a future
date.

For those of you who have been follow-
ing this column this summer, thanks. Up-
coming in the Fall we have plans to run
columns dealing with: The fall TV shows,
Albany Radio, the situation with cable TV
on campus, along with other news about
the media. 'Til then,enioy your summer!

Pittman Hall: SUNYA’s Suburban Dormitory

Continued lrom page one be a dump
so I could write a great expose. All
reporters are sensitive to charges that
they're sensationalizing a story. With this
new frame of mind I parked the car and
went out to see what the university had
gotten 75 students into.

I was immediately impressed. In front
of me, facing the panoramic view of the
Berkshires, was a great old building that
looked like a stereotype of an ivy league
prep school. It hada chimney, suggesting
toasting marshmallows with warm co-eds
in the dead of winter. It had a front lawn
that cried out for Frisbee players. The
place was obviously well maintained.

“God, the university's done us right
this time," I thought as [entered the door
of the building. I stumbled upon a
cleaning woman eating her lunch.

“Who the hell are you?" she asked,
munching on what smelled like acat-food
sandwich. “I’m from the state university

Jonathan Hodges

newspaper, and I’m doing a story on the
building that the university just rented.”

“What the hell you doing here?" she
asked. “Pittman Hall's the next building
over."

I thanked her and quickly retraced my
steps. Outside I glanced around and saw
a small building to the right of my ivy-
covered, marshmallow-toasting, Frisbee—
throwing dream dorm. Oh well, at least
the reputation of the university was safe.

Pittman Hall was dwarfed by the main
building I had just come from. At first
glance I had thought it was a garage,
but I soon saw that it was a two—level
structure and rightfully deserved to be
called a building.

Upon entering the building I heard
voices coming from one of the nearby
rooms. "You want the card or don’t ya,"
said a voice in that flat, monotone sound
so native to Albany, but alien to Long
Island ears.

I peaked in and saw three members of
the university maintenance staff
engrossed in what looked like a serious
game of gin rummy. I waved hello. The
response was an inarticulate grunt.
Seeing that these were men who wouldn‘t
appreciate a kibhtzer, I slipped out and
began to explore.

I climbed to the third floor and

immediately felt an intense feeling of deja
w. A former Alden Hall resident, the
rooms gave off the same vibes. Maybe it
was the SUNYA furniture that had
already been installed. Maybe it was the
walls that had been painted SUNYA blue
or yellow. Whatever it was, it made me
cock an ear listening for someone to
shout "Foosball?" or see a crowd from
Waterbury heading toward O'Heaney's.

While the rooms were slightly larger
than those at Alumni, there was the
consideration that the Alumni rooms are
doubles and these at Pittman are to be
triples. The exceptions were the corner
rooms, which are three-man suites
consisting of a double and single room
connected by a private bathroom. The
rest of the hall is on the old communal
bath system.

The second floor was a carboncopy of
the third.

There were 12 rooms on each of the

 

floors, with only the rooms at the back of
the building open to the “panoramic view
of the Berkshires." There is actually a
better view of the road network of greater
Albany. Ah, to write real estate
brochures.

The first floor is devoted to the
residence staff, limited kitchen facilities
and lounges. I entered the T.V. lounge
and smiled as nothing happened when I
turned it on. Obviously it had been stolen
from one of Eastman Tower's lounges. A

touch of SUNYA comes to Loudonville. '

4 Dining should be fun. Breakfast will be
mandatory. UAS isn't promising
anything, but it just might be able to serve
hot eggs with breakfast. Maybe by the
second semester. The rest of the meals
can be served (in-campus. Shades of
Country Squire.

A quick flight of stairs leads down to
the sub-level. One side of rooms shares

the basement with the boiler room. The
sight of the machinery was comforting in
a way. You never see machinery on
campus. Stone would throw a fit if you
saw that his dorms had to be heated,
have water delivered and wastes
removed. Everyone knows of the heating
tunnels connecting the dorms with the
podium, but no one ever enters them. In
contrast, the heating machinery was
definitely a comfort.

As I. left Pittman Hall I started
wondering how to cover such vital
information as how the transportation
will operate and how does a disenchanted
student break his contract. I never found
a way. Call the residence office if you've
got questions. This article isn’t meant to
provide information, only ego
gratification.

I climbed down the hill and unlocked
my car. A loner gull was circling high
above mo. He crapped on my windshield.
