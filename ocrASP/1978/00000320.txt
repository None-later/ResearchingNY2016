‘Little Foxes’ Portrays the Politics
And Passion of Southern Family

 

 

Perhaps this proves that the Summer
Theatre Company’s forte is drama. Or
maybe they werejust saving their best for
last. In any case, The Little Foxes is a
most fitting send-off for director Edward
Golden, who leaves us in the fall for the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Lillian Hellman‘s tale of greed and
brotherly love is no easy piece to
produce; with its studied southern
manners and insidious familial
relationships, overtones are important.
Hellman defines her characters as much
through spaces and silences as through
dialogue. Pacing, therefore, is a crucial
element, and Golden does a masterfuljob
putting his cast through some difficult
steps. This is especially impressive in the
case of Laura Nichols, who does an ex-
cellent job in an eleventh hour substitu-
tion in the part of Birdie Hubbard.

The Hubbard’s are a well-to-do
southern family who, in the year 1900, are
very conscious of not belonging to the
aristocracy. When the opportunity for
wealth arises, they are transformed. We
begin to see the evil lengths to which they
will go in a chance to get a “fair share”
from life.

The struggle comes down to a cold
war between brother and sister, between
Ben and Regina Hubbard. They're each
out for themselves, and in this game an
emotional advantage equals a financial
advantage.

Daniel Charles Duross and Jinx
Lindenauer are very effective as Ben and

Reporter’s Rights Tested—
Farber Wins
48 Hours of Freedom

HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) New York
Times reporter Myron A. Farber won at
least 48 hours of freedom yesterday when
US. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall temporarily delayed his jail
sentence.

Farber, ordered jailed until he turns
over his notes on the Dr. X murder case,
was to report to the Bergen County Jail
at noon yesterday.

Instead, the reporter was in New York,
waiting for Marshall’s last minute deci-
sion on the Times' request for a delay in
the juiliug, said Times attorney Eugene R.
Schciman.

The ’l'imcs, rebuffed by Justice Byron
R. White on 'l‘uesday, asked Marshall
yesterday to stay the contempt sentence
pending an appeal to the full U.S.
Supreme Court or a New Jersey
appellate court.

In issuing the stay until noon Friday.
Marshall did not comment on whether
the Supreme Court would review the
case on its merits.

Farber will be jailed Friday unless
another stay is issued. Under his

Regina, exhibiting a surface calm that
belies the calculating machinations
below. Duross is especially good as the
angry southern gentleman; a man of sub-
dued rage, a man who prefers to conduct
the most uncivilized business in a most
civilized manner.

Robert Donnelly's set is, in a word,
beautiful. The awesome architecture and
stiff furnishings are a marvel of detailed
realism, bringing alive eveyone’s idea of a
1900 deep south living room.

Accents were a problem, with most of
the actors trying too hard to be southern.
The results were highly affected, and this,
coupled with the wordier dialogue of the
first act, gave rise to a slow start.

The appearances of Hilarie Delman
and William Leone did much to thin the
density of dialect onstage. Turning in
near-flawless performances, Delman’s
very credible transformation from in-
nocence to independence supplies the
play with its powerful climax, and Leone’s
Oscar is the source for small doses of
comic relief.

The appearance of Regina’s husband,
Horace, throws a voice of sanity into the
fray. Horace has been bed-ridden for
months, and baffles the others with his
desire to die peacefully. When he refuses
to join in their money-making venture,
their greed ~- and the newly-revealed
feelings of his wife — prove more harmful
to him than his disease.

sentence. he is to be jailed until he turns
over his notes on the deaths of five
patients at a Bergen County hospital and
then serve a six-month contempt
sentence for the refusal.

Marshall also stayed the payment of a
$5,000 a day fine against the Times until
the notes are turned over.

If Marshall denies the permanent stay,
Scheiman said they could take their
application to another justice. But, he
said, “I don’t believe we would do that."

Justice William Brennan usually has
jurisdiction over emergency applications
from New Jersey when the court is not in
session, but he was vacationing and was
not available to hear the case. The clerk
of the court assigned the matter to White.

After White rejected the petition, the
Times attorneys were free to apply to
another justice.

Farber's investigation of a series of
mysterious deaths at Riverdell Hospital in
Oradell in the 1960's led to the reopening
of the inactive case and the indictment of
Dr. Mario Jascalevich on five counts of
murder.

Chevy Chase is a funny person. But
that's not why Foul Play is a funny film.

It’s climax time. Chase plants his feet,
arms outstretched clutching a police
revolver, and plucks the villanous albino
from the stage scaffolding in a bark of gun»
fire. That’s not funny — it's ludicrous.
Chase has too much hair and too few
cavities. Everyone knows he’s not Kojak.

 

Stephen Dzinanka

 

That’s right. Chase feeds the albino a
belly-lull of lead before he can assassinate
the Pope. Don't get uptight. The plot
sinks anyway.

80 Chase maneuvers in and out of
scenes with the cool temerity of a gestapo
agent. He neither OVerplays nor un-
derplays the part enough to be
humorous. He plays it straight, and that's
too bad. Chevy Chase pushing drama is
like Ronald McDonald pushing dope.
Doesn't work.

A kid walks up to Ronald and expects
to get a hand puppet or maybe a ham-
burger. Ronald lays an ounce of reefer on
the kid who turns around and feeds it to
his hamster. The kid doesn‘t know how
to handle it.

The concept is the same. Saturday
Night Live's premiere performer isn't
about to bamboozle the audience with
bellicose bravado. But he tries, or at least
the director coerces him to try. It's
probably the director. Chase has proven
himself a worthy comic. The point is that
the audience doesn’t expect Chase to
play it straight. And it's not nice to disup

with her umbrella and wide-eyed in-
nocence. She is lucky enough to beat a
dwarfed Bible salesman off of her window
ledge into an empty barrel which rolls
down several ﬂights of stairs finally ejec-
ting him into an open manhole. The inno-
cent dwarf is hospitalized in a body cast.
Hawn brings him ﬂowers. Not bad.

Then there’s Burgess Meredith, the
elderly landlord who exchanges karate
blows with a deceitful old witch playing
for the bad guys. She finds nothing
salubrious about livin‘g on the sinister side
of the tracks when Meredith finishes her
off, tossing her in amongst the guts of a
baby grand piano and slamming the lid
shut. Classy.

There is a certain amount of suspense
and intrigue in FoulPlay, but it's a sideline

the environment which nurtures the
comedy and lends it some purpose, no
matter how illogical.

Foul Play makes the mistake ol allow-
ing one of the main characters to carry a
trite plot. In a film like this. the plot must
be almost completely ignored. itll traces
of seriousness must be counterbalanced
by inanity. Gene Wilder managed to
maintain a near perfect blend of the
sincere and the sick, spearheading the
success of Silver Streak. it works.
Anything in between projects pretense
into the work.
