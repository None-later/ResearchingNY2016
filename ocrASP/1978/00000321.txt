Orange Joe

Attorneys for a former American
soldier who worked with agent
orange in Vietnam have filed a $10
million civil action suit in New York
State against Dow Chemical and
two other companies which produc-
ed the chemicals contained in the
lethal herbicide.

Agent orange is a combination of
245T which is produced by Dow
Chemical, and 24D, which is
manufactured by the Philips Cor-
poration and the Rhodia Company.
Agent orange was used extensively
by the United States government in
Vietnam to defoliate the coun-
tryside.

in the suit filed with the New York
State Supreme Court, lawyers for
ex-veteran Paul Reutersham main-
tain that Dow and the other com-
panies were aware that the
chemicals they were selling were
toxic. The suit states that as a result
of his exposure to,agent orange in
Vietnam, Paul Reutersham is now
dying of cancer.

Mark Sokoloff, one of
Reutersham’s attorneys. says that
the suit will attempt to hold Dow
Chemical accountable for the
damage to Reutersham, despite the
fact that the statute oflimitations for
liability is technically up.
Reutersham was exposed to the
agent orange in 1968. Dow can only
be held liable for damages which oc-
curred within seven years from the
time Reutersham was exposed.
Sokoloff says, however, that he will
attempt to show that in cancer
cases, the culpability limit should be
extended because cancer often
does not show up [or at least ten
years after exposure to carcinogenic
chemicals.

Sokoloff says that his firm will try
to get the New York State law
changed so that cancer victims can

sue the manufacturers of toxic sub-
stances they believe may have caus-
ed their often fatal diseases.
The suit could have nationwide
significance. Thousands of veterans
reportedly were exposed to agent
orange in Vietnam. Citizen Soldier,
a New York-based veterans group,
says that those soldiers are now tur-
ning up with extraordinary rates of
liver cancer, nervous diseases and
birth defects in their offspring.

. Jog Log

Here are some staggering
statistics for joggers and non-joggers
alike.

Science Digest magazine reports
that currently as many as 23 million
Americans are running a total of 17
billion miles a year.

The magazine says that for every
one of those 17 billion miles run, 100
calories are burned off. That works
out to be a whopping 1700 trillion
calories burned off each year.

in case you’re wondering how
much fat is being burned off by all
that exercise, Science Digest says it
works out to be a total weight loss
nationwide of 500 million pounds an-
nually.

Dark Conspiracy

The House Assassination Com-
mittee is reportedly planning to go
public with what it says is documen-
tation of a conspiracy to "get Black
leadership in America."

New Times magazine quotes
Committee Chairman Louis Stokes
as charging that a number ofgovern-
ment agencies are "out to get Black
leadership all across the country."
Said Stokes, “i think it is organized
and follows a definite pattern. Most
Black elected officials have been
subjected to every type of investiga-
tion you can possibly undergo,
because of their color."

in 1968, Representative Adam

Clayton Powell Jr. was chargedwith
misuse of Federal funds. Since then
New Times says, at least 16 Black
representatives have claimed they
were harassed by the government.
Among thse who have been in-
vestigated are Representatives
Ralph Metcalfe and Charles
Rangels, and Representative
William Clay, who the Justice
Department unsuccessfully tried to
link with narcotics trafficking.

Clay charges that there is a
"national conspiracy to undermine
and eliminate outspoken Black

leadership," in the U5.

New Times says that the House
Committee plans to hold public
hearings on the matter on August
14th.

Hornet Walk-a-Bout

A University of Florida
mechanical engineer reports he is
studying the legs of insects in hopes
of eventually producing a vehicle
that “walks or runs" instead of roll-
ing on wheels.

Assistant Engineering Professor
Doctor Sanjay Dhande says he is
studying the legs of beetles in an
effort to develop vehicles with legs
that will be able to negotiate the
rugged terrain of a distant planet, as
well as travel on the ocean floor.
Dhande says that his design will be
used to build military legged-vehicles
before designing space and ocean
transports.

Dhande reports that by studying
bettles' legs and finding out how
much energy the beetle requires and
how much energy it consumes, he
will be able to arrive at a fairly good
copy of a biological system of
locomotion.

The engineering professor
reports that after studying beetles, he
will research the locomotion of frogs
and eventually move on to more
sophisticated four-legged animals.

of the future, according to a Utah
State University nutrition specialist.

Doctor D.K. Salukhe is predicting
that some day beans will be used as
“fast foods" to replace meat protein.

Salukhe reports that many
children stiffer brain damage and
lack of resistance to infection
because of inadequate protein in
their diets. He adds that the protein
deficiency is compounded because
certain people avoid meat protein
due to their religious beliefs or
because they can't afford it.

The food science professor says
beans are the ideal soution to pro-

 

tein deficiency because they are in-
expensive and available worldwide.

Saiukhe says, by the way, that
there's no reason why beans can't
taste good. too. He is currently
researching was to make the bland
legumes more appealing.
