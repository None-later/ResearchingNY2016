New Withdrawal Policy
In Effect This Year

Aron Smlth
October 27 will be the last day that
JNYA students may drop fall
nester courses. according to a
oposal approved by SUNYA
esident Vincent O‘l.eary last
"ﬁll.

ademic record; Under the policy in
feet last year. students could drop

Never. in cases of voluntary

The new policy also states that
there there is no evidence of atten-

Iffice in writing.

According to the Center foe Utt-
ergraduate Education associate
.eonard Lapinski, the policy is the
irect result of a compromise reach-
d by SA and the Undergraduate
tcademic Council‘s Committee on
twdemic Standing. SA submitted a
roposal to the Committee based on

student questionnaire. The Cm-
tittce. in turn. conducted a faculty

ities are doing it now. but many of
he faculty felt that six. seven or eight
reeks were enough. The date which
Ias selected was specially designed

pportunity to have some kind of
valuation before they haVe to make
decision whether to drop a course.“
esaid.

After approval by the UAC
membership. the Commmittee on
cademic Standing's final draft of
1c withdrawal policy was presented
) the University Senate. At its final
ceting of l977-78. the Senate ap—
'oved the proposal.

“One ofthe major questions which
.me up was could we reprogram the
ttiversity. the whole computer and
cord-keeping system.“ said
'l.eary. “A lot of admtntstrative
tff put a lot of extra effort in this
tnmer so that we could get it in by
ll. And we made it.“

Lapinski calls the new withdrawal

policy a liberal one. accomodating
“both the wishes of the studettt and
those of the faculty.“ it does.
however. bear potential for student
abuse. he said. “Students are goittg
to have to plan their semesters
differently and decide whether they
should continue with their courses.
because no one outside the Universi-
ty is going to know whether or not a
student dropped his courses." said
Lapinski. “But if someone sees that
you have 15 credits one semester. l2
credits the next semester. and nine
credits another semester. they‘re
probably going to assume that the
student dropped courses. which may
or may not be held against them,
They might just have to do a little
more explaining.“ he said.

According to Lapinski. students
using the policy as a means of “hav-
ing everything removed frotn their
records" may find themselves failing
to make sufficient progress toward a
degree. and may be terminated. 'l'er-
mination and probation arc deter-
mined at SUNYA by a graduated
retention chart which requircsenter-
ing freshmen to complete six credits
in the first semester. and minimum
of twelve credits for each semester
thereafter. Students completing only
minimum standards for retention
must attend ten semesters. com-
pleting a minimum of 23 credits in
their last year.

“1 think the basic thingherc is that
the majority ofstudepts are not plan-
ning to abuse the policy.“ said
Lapinski. "and if you‘re caught in a
bind and have to drop a course.
you‘re not going to be penalized.“

The withdrawal cut-off at one
week after the mid-term date will aid
instructors as well as students. as
valuable time in the last half of the
semester will not be lost to students
dropping courses at the last possible
moment.

“I think the main concern right
now is letting everyone know about
it. which is really a problem on this
campus." said Lapinski. “I think the
word will be spread once it gets go—
ing. l‘tn basically pleased with the
whole process. going right front the
spring with the Student Association
and going right up through the Presi-

O‘l.eary said this despite the fact
that recruitment of new faculty has
been taking place in both
departments. including a new cltair

years an increased emphasis on
writing and a change in degree re.
quirements have been initiated
within the English department. He
feels that a major restructuring
would “be something like geology

Housing Crunch Creates Hassles

by Jon Hodges

At the start of this week. the
SUNYA Residence ()lfice was hous-
ing 50 students in RA suiterooms
and 70 more in Brubacher‘s base-
mettt. Sayles‘ loungerooms and quad
gttest rooms. One hundred and six-
teen students were living in tripled
rooms and 75 are in a leased building
in Loudonville.

The story of how the university
has arrived at this situation is cer-
tainly not out of Harold Robbins. If
the Residence and Admissions of—
fices are to be believed. there are no
villains. The present dilemma was
arrived at by “treating students as in-
dividuals. not numbers." according
to one administration official. The
story has no heroes. No one is blam-
ed for the problems and no one takes
credit for possible solutions.

But the worse problem with this
story is that no moral is learned. No
one is saying that they now know
how to prevent such situations in the
future. lndced. officials in Residence
and Admissions as much as admit
that we can expect the same
problems next year. And perhaps
that is the only reason that this story
is worth being told at all.

The story begins irt the Ad-
missions Office, over a full year ago.
At that time ettrollment goals forthe
university were being planned. in a
complicated formula in which the ul-
timate goal is to admit a certain
amount of students so the total stu—
dent population ntoves upward ever
so slightly. the office decides to

-

accept 2950 new undergraduates.

“It was tough to know how many
applications to accept to meet our
enrollment goals." said Ron Hart.
director of the university's Ad-
missions Office. “Applications were
down all over SUNY and no one
seemed to know what it meant.

“One group said that the small
number of applications would mean
a higher percentage ofreturn. but we
just didn‘t want to gamble. If we had
acted on the assumption that the
percentage was going to be higher
and it had been the percentage as we
originally predicted. we wouldn't
have made ourenrollment goal. And
that is felt beyond the dorms; it‘s felt
in the classroom in terms of less
faculty lines."

This inability to accurately predict
the number of students who would
attend SUNYA out of the number
accepted (an inexact science under
the best of circumstances) lead to
more freshmen being enrolled than
originally planned for. Hart said the
latest figure was that the freshmen
class is 321 above the number plann-
ed. though Hart's office is still iden-
tifying no—shows.

“The university has a policy of
providing housing for in-coming
freshmen." said Hart. “When we saw
tltc problem. we contacted the
Residence Office to see what cottld
be done for the freshmen and also
the transfers and graduate students
who were also requesting housing.“

Yet the Residence Office was hav-
ing its owtt problems. Housng's con»

tinuing student sign-up in April
showed that the Admissions Office
was not the only one that was being
plagued by a change in student
habits. The migrational pattern of
students living in dorms were differ-
ing radically from past years.

“About 80 percent of last year‘s
freshmen.(this year‘s sophomores)
elected to remain on campus.“ said
John Welty. Residence Office direc-
tor. "This was 10 percettt higherthnn
in past years."

No one seems to know why more
students elected to stay on campus
this year than in the past. University
Auxiliary Services suggest it‘s
because the food is better than ever.
Off Campus Association contends
it‘s because the housing shortage in
Albany is getting critical. Whatever
the reason for the problem.
Residence was expected to come up
with a solution .,
