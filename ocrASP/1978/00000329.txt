phrase "Ya Know.“ University Vice
President Frank Lakin says that one
of the best grammar lessons tl college
can instillis simply to teach students
not to continually use the words “ya
know“ during pauses in their
sentences.

After “ya know" has been wiped
out. other targets of The War on

phrases as “really” and "i hear you.“
and the non-word “irregardless.”

shirt or a polyester shirt?

Cotton International claims that
polyester shirts are a waste of
resources. because it requires five
times more energy to produce
polyester than cotton.

On the other side is the publica-
tion American Sr'iemisl. which
reports that polyester shirts take less
energy to wash. dry and iron than

cotton. and they last about one-und— _

a-half times longer than pure cot-
ton shirts. Therefore. in the long
run. polyester uses up half the energy
ofcotton shirts. the publication says.

And adding even more confusion
and fuel to the energy debate is the
National Cotton Council which dis—
