rchitects and prolessional

architectural critics were itot

the only ones whose opinions

varied concerning Stone‘s

designs, lhe lttlltmlllg is a

randotn sampling ol SUNYA students
lound “podiating” by the lountains.

Anne. a junior ll'()lll Mohawk lower

had what seemed to he the inttioiity

opinion. She liked the campus in general

but. she said. “I hate it in the \tintei. lt's

mtich better when the lountains are on."

Carrie. a lreshman icsident ol (‘linton

llall uttered her early impressions ol the

campUs: “ll looks nice." she said. “hut it's

too symmetrical. you get lost at liI'st. but

once you get used to it It‘s not bad. It‘s
good that they ha\c all classes together.
bill I hear it‘sawmd tunnel inthe winter."

Nancy. another Ireshman. liked the
looks ol‘thc campus. but was glad that slte
lived downtown. because she didn‘t like
the lact that uptown dorms are so similar
(architecturally) to the school, “You need
to lane a change ol pace when )ou get oil
the podium." she said.

Smeral people liked the campus but
tell that it was better suited to a warmer
climate, l:ric. a iunior. suggested Saudi
Arabia.

Bob. a sophomore l’ierce llall resident
said that Albany was “delinitely a good

N

looking school but as I‘m as practicality is
concerned, it's terrible. I he glass all'oi‘ds
no ittsulation to the place at all." he said.
"It‘s a waste ol tucl."

In comparing Ste\e‘s (a sophomore
l'rom Stuyvesant lower) r 'ttclion to
Bob‘s. it's easy to see how subjective a
topic architecttire can be. Steve tell that
the eatnpus is not “aesthetically pleasing.
but it is efﬁcient. liverythmg is centrally
located,"

An anonymous passerhy [mm the
