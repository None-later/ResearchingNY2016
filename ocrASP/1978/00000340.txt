No Room

To the Editor: ':

I‘hc University has once again mer-
acccpted new students. Unable to house the
overflow in normal dot miton
aceomodations. the administration packs
freshman seven to a suite twlier'c the normal is
six). and fills guest rooms. '1 hey sliip other
students IE miles a day to Loudoitvillc.
I’inally. those students who ttrc still left
without a root overhead are sent into an
already glutted apartment market oil
campus. Economics majors. what should this
increased demand do to pliCL‘s'.’

There are several serious questions raised
here; first. how can the Adrttissions ()llicc
accept hundreds of students that the
Residence ()ificc cannot trccotrimodatc'.’ ls
communication across the campus that
dil'ficult'.’ Second. how cart the lltli\t.‘l’sil)
expect us. the students. to ptrt up “till "sardine
cart" rrccoirimodations to cover their riiistakcs'.’
An administrative error has becortic our
problem.

lliit'd. what will it cost the Urinersity“.I
think: in a six person suite uptown where each
person pays $375 per semester. the frittersin
receives $2.250 per semester for that suite. II a
seventh student is ptrt iri that suite and rent is
lot all the siiite's occupants is reduced to $350
per semester. that suite brings in $245!) per
semester. i'\‘cll ii the l‘ni\crsity can de-tripic
hull til the expected 350 "sardine students" by
the ciid oi licinllselticstct . they should t’cccitc
r'y'Iru iricoruc totalling 335.000. Vol bad lot an
ttdtiiutisti'atiw ciroi.

Izrrors cart be excused once. Maybe c\cii
twice. fact is. this is the liitli year in army ol
ti\Cl'-IltililiSSiUIlh. Maybe the mistakes are
honest. Or maybe they are one way to raise
money in the lace oi state-itiaridatcd cutbacks.

liitlici way. one thing is clear. It is not the
University that sullcrs lrom their errors. It is
us.

The suN‘YA Squeeze

A year ago. it was a disaster. A number of students requesting housing

ton—campus were sent to a motel eight miles away from campus and were

provided with such luxuries as having to pay for their infrequent
transportation to campus and overcrowded conditions
Those who were privileged to live at SUNYA’s own Country Squire
Hilton will long remember the enjoyable evenings without heat...
Last year. the administration failed to accomodate students wishing to
live on-campus because of ‘the unexpected injlux of those wanting
housing. This year, it‘s more of the same as students tripled in suites is
not an uncommon site. I '
As for next year. more of thesame will probably occur. Which brings
one chstion to mind: How long mUSt a situation occur and still remain
“unexpected”? If year after year there are more students wanting
housing than the University can provide, when will SU NYA wise up and
do something about it?
One reason can be money. Students who are tripled in suites still pay
the same amount of ronm prices. Though the housing provided is
inadcquatclycrowded . the University still reaps monitary cnefits.
(irantcd. there are many valid reasons fot the overcrowding and it
might be hard to come up with accurate estimates of students wanting
on—campus hhusing. the least SUN YA can do is give a financial break to
those who are forced to live in over crowded conditions. For these
students. SUNYA has already ptit the squeeze on them.

Doctoral Programs

Well. SUNYA finally lost its history and English PltDs aftera year and a
half of legal battles over wlitcrthc State Edueation Department had the
power to tcrmititzitc them. Currently. those two programs are
tindcrgoing plans to possibly bring themsele up to the SED levels.

Chemistry. which lost its l’lil) last year. has invited scholars iii order to
build tip the jqartment. ()thcr departments will soon also be under SEI)
scrutiny.

As a uniycrsity center. Stl NYA has undergone much iicgatiy e publicity
iii the past ten years. A lot oftliis has its roots in ad minstratiy effoul-ups.
St] N YA right now is at a crucial point lll its history as a nivcrsity— what is
needed is strong leadership. and intellcg‘cnt planning. With a bit of
foresight. SUNYA just might be able to be on its way to positive
dcyclopmcut once again.
