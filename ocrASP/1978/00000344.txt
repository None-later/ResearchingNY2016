“Without a question, it's the.

toughest schedule we‘ve ever ltad

here." states Albany State Soccer

coach Bill Sehieffelin,as the booters

take on the likes of defending

National Champion Hartwick.
ECAC Div I Champion Oneonta
and the NAIA runner-up, Keene
State. "This kind of schedule ex-
poses the players to quality op-
ponents. and the fans also benefit
from the resulting matches." says
Schieffelin.

Albany's regular season opens up
Wednesdtty night, Sept. l3 undertlte

the first of four Division I op-
ponents, San Jose State. Witltin the

After high school. Aldrich

brought his strong passing arm to

Albany. “The reason I came to
Albany was football" stated
Aldrich. “l was looking for a place
that had good education and
football that i thought I could play. I
also applied to Hobart and l was
looking at Lafayette. schools like
that. Albany came down as my
choice because it was cheapest too.
That was a big reason.“

As a freshman on the junior varsi-
ty football team. Aldrich found that
he had to compete with four other
quarterbacks. with himself being
fifth in line. Aldrich worked his way
up to the starting job for the first
game of the season. but then had to
split thejob with Fred Brewington.

two players became involved in a

OFFENSE

“This year the offense (eight
starters return) will be more evenly
divided between the fullback. half-
back and throwing the ball," says
Ford. “as opposed to last year when
Halstion and Glenn Sowalskie
(graduated halfback) caused the ma-
jor thrust of our offense."

Directing the Danes‘ wishbone at-
tack again this season will be senior
quarterback Brad Aldrich (See story
below). Completing passes at a 50%
clip last season. Aldrich‘s main asset
is his smarts. according to Ford.
“He‘s an intellectually superior kid.
Brad enjoys challenges and the
‘wishbone requires a great deal ol'job
thinking. He‘s done a good job of
running it.“

Backing up the 6‘0. l85 lb. signal
caller will be junior Terry Walsh.
sophomore Mike Fiorito and
freshman Joe l’iccariello. 'l‘ransl‘cr

Ed Ragulc rounds out this solid posi-
tion for Albany.

Four players are battling for tltc
two starting halfback spots itt place
of Halstion and Sowalskie. last
season‘s standout runners. Although
Ford acknowledges that their
replacements are pretty much un-
decided. he gives a slight edge to
sophomore Levi Lewis and junior
Bruce Clturcltwell. as they played
that position for Albany last fall.

Lewis. who runs the 40 in 4.4.
started in place of an injured Hals-

through their junior year.

“We came up together and we‘ve
been battling it out ever since.“ said
Aldrich. “it was good competition
between Fred and |. We like and
respect each other. and we pushed
each other. which helped the team
because we both had to work that
much harder."

“it made us better team players."
explained Brewington. “We ended ur
giving each other advice. Brad's a
good friend and a proven veteran."

On the varsity team as a
sophomore. Aldrich found hintscll
on the bench behind senior Dave
Altonen. After being sltut ottt their
first two games that season. ltcad
coach Bob Ford decided to replace
Ahonen witlt the sophomore
Aldrich.

“We weren't moving the football
itnd I felt that we had to make a
change." said Ford. “Brad had not
established himself as physically
superior. but ltc was a fierce corri-
petitor and intellectttally he could
perform the mental gymnastics
necessary to rtiti our offense.“

With Aldrich at the lieltii. the
Danes racked up 37 points their next
gatnc and a three-game winning
streak followed. in the team's sixth
game. against Norwich. Albany held
a Ztl-ltl lead at halftime. ()ri the first
play of the second ltalf Aldrich was
hit hard. but the results were even
ntorc painful: a separated shoulder.

“That was it for me for the rest of
the season." stated Aldrich. “l catne
back the last two games to backup
Freddie but i wouldn't have been
able to go very much. I couldn't
pick tip my right arm to throw.“

With his shoulder mended.
Aldrich prepared for a rewarding
junior year. Completing 50% of his
passes. Aldrich led the Danes to an

for the NCAA playoffs. With the
playoffs came a small amount of sur-
prise.

“Ever since we‘ve been here coach
Ford ltad the national championship
as our goal. But when you've never
been there and never even really
close to a championship you have to
be a little surprised. We knew llte
team had potential. but the thing we
didn't know is how good a team you
have to be to win a national cham-
pionsltip.“

The first playoff game was '.gaittst
llamden-Sidncy. and Aldrich
played the game of his career. His
seven completions in l2 attcrttpts
was rather ordinary. but his four
ltouchdown passes were extraor-
dinary.

“l didn‘t feel any pressure before
the game.“ explained Aldrich. “it
was greutjust to be there because win
or lose. we'd gotten that far. lint we
were there to win.“

In the semifinal game. ittjttrics
decimated the Dane backfield. Forc-
ed to the sidelines. Aldrich watched
as his learn eliminated by

“I don't think we could be satisfied
by just getting tlterc this year. if we

appointed il we don‘t win it all."

Brewington says. Ford admits that
