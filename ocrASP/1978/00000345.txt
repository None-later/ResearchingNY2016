directors, two leading professors,
and eight full professors, along with
a number of associate, assistant, and
visitingyprofessors and lecturers.

Every fall, the Academic Affairs
Office gets together with the Dean's
Council and the Resource Alloca-
tion Committee of the Educational
Policy Center here at SUNYA and
come up with a set of criteria to
decide how best to distribute the
various faculty and support per-
sonnel “budget lines" allocated to
SUNYA by SUNY Central, the
Department of Budget, and the
Governor‘s ofﬁce. A "line" is essen-
tially a job or position, which in-
cludes administrators, faculty. non-
teaching professionals, and various
other support positions, which in-
cludes everybody on the state payroll
at this University.

Ofa total of more than 2000 lines,
over 700 are faculty positions. The
criteria established for distributing

these lines among the various
departments within the university,
and the allocation decisions finally
made based on them, are what ﬁnal-
ly determine who will be recruited,
or at least for what department they
will be recruited. ‘

According to Martin, some of
these criteria include shifting student
enrollment, keeping strong
departments strong. strengthening
weaker ones, and alleviating un-
derstafftng problems.

Once it has been decided how the
authorized faculty lines should be
distributed among the departments.
the active recruitment of teachers
and professionals begins, usually
with advertisements in professional
journals and magazines. After a
speciﬁed cut-off date for responding
to the ads has passed, all
applications received are revieWed,
and a list compiled of the most likely
candidates for the position. These
are discussed among the faculty and
department chair. and a recommens

PhD’s: Picking Up the Pieces

Former SUNYA President
Emmett Fields was sitting in his of-

toral programs in History and
English at this institution. After a

toral review, both programs had
been terminated by former Com-
missioncr Ewuld Nyquist and the
first attempt by SUNY Central to
challenge the legality of Nyquist‘s
power to terminate the programs
had gone down to defeat.

Fields talked about the court deci-
sion and how both programs were
essential to SUNYA if it were to bed
strong university. Hc declared that
he was determined to build up both
programs and that “the efforts
would not stop until we succeed."

The SUNY Board of Trustees was,
preparing their first appeal of the

 Censures SUNY System

An investigation ofSUNY‘s 1974-
6 retrenchment practices by the
imerican Association of University
rofessors has resulted in SUNY's
ensure by that group.

in a report submitted in August of
977, the AAUP concluded that
:trenchments were effected with
disregard for tenure, for due notice.

climate in which
cadcmic freedom is gravely en-
angered.”
Last June. at the AAUP annual
toetingiidts members voted un-
nimouﬂyto add SUNY to its
at of pertained administrations.
Anal! spokesman Martin
.api‘ said that “the censure action
, not [degal action but a moral one

explained that SUNY‘s

     
 
   

 
    
  
  

   
 
    

Freedom and Tenure, a
he termed a “widely

accepted guideline in the academic
community."

That statement calls for the release
of textured faculty and staff only in
the case of “bonu-fidc financial ex-
igcncy." a condition anidus claims
did not exist.

“SUNYA made no clear case for
the proposition that financial crisis
threatened the survival ofthc univer-
sity,“ he said.

SUNYA‘s Vice-Chancellor for
Faculty and Staff Jerome Komisar,
in a June statement, disagreed.

"The AAUP failed tocomprehend
the complexity of the ﬁnancial
problems we faced. We lost over
2,000 employment positions
A AU I’ did not recognize
that our university, with its 64 dis-
crete units. presents a unique
problem in that tenured faculty can-
not be protected on one campus by
cutting from another one 4— chance
location cannot dictate action."

The AAUP report charges that
SUNY failed to adhere to "sound
academic practices“ in its retrench-

mcnt decisions. emphasizing the
small role faculty played in the
process and SUNY'S "failure to
ndhcrc to tenure agreements."

Additionally. the Assembly
Higher Education Committee
chaired by Assemblyman Melvin
Millcr released a report last Feb. 28
cntitlcd Retrenchmcnt in Higher
Education which told of abuses at
SUNYA as well as SUNY-wide. The
report states that “Complaints rang-
cd from undue hast and ad-
ministratch influence over decision
to charges of retaliation against in-
dividual faculty members and
attempts to cover-up administration
wrongdoings.“

SUNY spokesman Harry
Charlton protested that' “We
[SUNY] were bound by our contract
with UUl’ (Union of University
Professions; the group which
represents SUNY employees) to
enact retrenchments. We adhered to
principles of collective
bargaining...and protected our

decision. If SUNY lost on all ofthc
possible appeals, it would take an es-
timated year and a half. That would
be ample time. Fields said. to build
up both departments to SED levels
and get back the PhD‘s. "At the end
of that building time." the former
president predicted. “I‘ll just knock
on the Commissioner's door and say,
‘(livc it back to me' 

Well. a year and a half has passed
and the SUNY Board of Trustees
have indeed lost on all ofthc appeals.
In that time. the nameplate on the
Commissioner's door changed from
Nyquist to Gordon Ombach. And
that door won't be knocked on by
limmctt Fields, who has since moved
on the Vanderbilt University. where
South African lcnnis players have
occupied much of his time.

But even if Fields had stayed in
Albany. it is unlikely that hi‘ bold
prediction would come true. N01 is it
likely that SUNYA President Vin-
ccnt O'Lcary will be knockingonthe
Commissioner‘s door demanding
the return ofthc English and History
I’hD's. Not for now at least.

English and History are currently
at the discussion level of the
rebuilding process. Both
dcpnrtrncnts arcattcmptingto assess
where their strengths and
weaknesses are and where any major
recruitment should be attempted.
Nobody is saying how long all ofthis
will take. but it is safe to ussumethat
it could be several years before the
programs will be ready to be
presented to the SED for review.

Recruitment has not been an easy
task, largely because ofthc publicity
of the legal battles over the
programs. Simply stated. it is hard to
attract top-ﬂight people who are es-
tablished in their respective univer-
sitics to a department which has had
its doctoral program de-registered.
Especially if that program has gain~
ed nation-wide attention.

“I think they [SUNY] were nuts to
go to court." said Nyquist ina recent
interview. “What it did was givehigh
public visibility that these were bad
programs at Albany State. That
could only hurt recruitment."

l‘iclds attempted mtms recruit-
ment during the time of the court
battle. He outlined "improvement

plans" for both departments. and set
up goals to be reachedwithina fairly
short time-period.

One of those goals was to recruit
l'ivc nationally recognized history
scholars in a three year period.
SUNYA went all out, offering big
salaries and fringe benefits. What
happened was that the department
was turned down by many top-flight
historians because of the de-
rcgistration of the PhD program. As
scholar after scholar turned down
SU N YA, the offers and rejections hit
the press » hcncc, even more bad
publicity. At the time. Emmett
l‘iclds lamented that SUNYA was
“embedded under the cloud of de-
rcgistcring.“

“We attempted to do an extremely
difficult task." said Dean of Social
Sciences Richard Kendall. “It's very
dilficult to recruit senior professors
in a short period of time. Youjust
don't do that."

Kendall added that the court bat-
tlc had a “dampening effect. It inter-
jccted a fairly high degree of uncer-
minty.“

The improvement plan ﬁnally
bore fruit for History in the summer
of I977, when Joseph Wall agreed to
take over as chair. Because of
obligations. Wall was not able to
begin his work at SUNYA until this
fall. in the interim, recruitment in
lilt: History Department was at a
stand-still.

“We decided to take a bye for a
year,“ said Kendall. “Part of it was
because Wall would not be coming
here for a year."

English had better luck, as the
