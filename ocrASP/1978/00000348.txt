The Vice President then makes a
recommendation to the president,

who makes the final decision on ap-I

pointment. All along the way, there
are conferences between ad-
ministrators. deans, chairmen. and
faculty, right up until the fatal deci-
sion is made, according to Martin.
The entire process is also monitored
by an Afﬁrmative Action Com-
mittee, to insure that the recruiting
adheres to a body of guidelines
which specify rules regarding treat-
ment of women and minorities.
Usually. the recruitment process
involves more than simply picking
- among those who respond to the ads.
particularly in the case of a dean or
department chair. or a national or
international scholar.

“These people. really good senior
people, usually don‘t respond to the
ads," Martin said. “You hear about'
these people or you know about
them. and you have to approach
them, and try to sell the university to
them," he added. Often, these
prospective scholar recruits are in-
vited to p cut a paper here. so he
can form an opinion about SUNYA,
and vice-versa.

An ironic sidelight to this year’s
recruitment is that although
SUNYA has picked up 70 new facul-
ty members. the university, and all
SUNY. is currently operating under
a position freeze, according to
SUNYA President O'Leary.

A position freeze. O‘Leary ex-
plained, is a restriction imposed by
the state government (which in-
cludes the State Legislature, the
Department of the Budget and the
Governor’s Office) and SUNY Cen-

_ I“ Recruited  '

tral on the number of authorized
positions of lines that SUNYA is
permitted to ﬁll. 4 .

Although SUNYA has actually
been allocated 2247 lines for the
academic year '78-'79. in an effort to
make an additional cut in state ex-
penditures, the state has informed
SUNYA that it must carry a certain
number of its lines vacant.

What this means is that although
SUNYA was allocated x number of
lines. the state has only provieded
enough money for x — 79 positions.
In order to stay within the budget,
SUNYA must maintain 79 ofits full
time equivalent lines vacant.

According to SU NYA Budget Of-
ficer Harold Brink. SUNYA muSt
have attained this reduction in per-
sonnel by March 3, I979. "By March
3. SUNYA’s payroll must be reduced
from 2247 full-time equivalent
positions to 2168." Brink said.

“Because so many of the F.T.E.
employees _
should be able to attain that fibure
on time through normal attrition
alone.“ Brink explained. Attrition is
the loss of employees through
transfers, people leaving for better
jobs. promotion, deaths. or other
personal reasons.

Brink said that there is “absolutely
no question“ about the university fir-
ing any of its employees to reduce its
payroll. "We'd get there whether we
wanted to or not." Brink said. As it
turns out. SUNYA usually carries a
number of its authorized position
vacant anyway. even under normal
circumstances, owing to natural at-
triti on. which is an ever-present con-
dition.

An apparent paradox of this situa-
tion is that the state.while imposing
the vacancy freele. allocated 12 new
faculty lines to SUNYA last April,
along with six additional support
lines.

According to Martin, eight of the
12 F.T.E. lines have beensubdivided

New University Council Chair Appointed

by Edith Berelson

Governor Carey has appointed a
new chair of SUNYA's University
Council. a group whose duties in-
clude choosing the SUNYA presi-
dent. ‘

Attorney Thomas Whalen was ap-
pointed June 16 to replace former
chair J. Vanderbuilt Straub who
retired. He has beenon the council
since Feb. 22 of this year.

Whalen is afﬁliated with the law
firm of Cooper, Erving and Savage.
He has been a member of the Board
of Foundation at SUNYA since
I970, and its President for the past
two years. The Foundation funds
SUNYA activities which don't
receive funds from the state.

Regarding trends for the budget.
Whalen said “The entire State Un-
iversity system is under an austerity
program dictated to local campuses
by the legislature." With sufﬁcient

budget. Whalen said. “The area that .

I would like to be able to do
something about would be student

In addition to recommending the
SUNYA president. the University
Council is also responsible for the
presentation of the University‘s
Budget to the Board of Trustees.
Other duties include holding month-
ly meetings to review major plans of
the institution including the areas of
faculty expansion. student housing
and regulations for the use of
SUNYA property.
SUNYA's Councilconsists ofnine
members who are appointed by the j

,

governor for nine year terms. and
one non-voting student member. SA

holds the student seat on the council.
Each university in the SUNYA
system has its own University Coun-
cil as stipulated by state education
law.

Whalen explained that the reason
that the student council member
cannot vote is because the education
law only provides for a non-voting
student member. "I 'don‘t know the

Whalen expressed satisfaction at

the choice of Vincent O'Leary for
SUNYA president. “I thought it was
a marvelous selection. I have always

into 32 Teaching Assistantships
since a T.A. is equivalent to .2;
F.T.E., in an attempt to strengthen
an area where SUNYA is com.
paratively deficient.

.“Compared to the three other
SUNYA centers,“ Martin said,“ we
have the smallest proportion of
T.A.‘s-to-faculty. We have up.
proximater one-half the proportion
Stonybroolt has."

As far as the allocation of T.A_‘5
goes, Martin said there are a number
of factors influencingwho gets what.
The largest and the strongest
departments get the most T.A.‘s
generally, but there are other factors
as well. such as a particular
department‘s efforts to obtain exter-
nal grant support for its T.A.‘s, or
the effect more Teaching
Assistantships would have on a
department‘s research efforts.

Ten T.A.'s were allocated to the
College of Math and Sciences. tento
the Social and‘Behavioral Sciences,
and six to Humanities and Fine Arts.
Math and Sciences is large and
strong. Social Sciences is rapidly
growing. and all three schools have
departments that are coming up for
State Education Department review
in the next year or two. said Martin,
a further factor considered in
deciding how to allocate faculty and
assistants. Four T.A.'s went to
Education. and two to the Graduate
School ‘of Public Affairs.

department was able to recruit chair
John Gerber. who has attracted
some top-notch people. The depart~

; ment also placed a larger emphasis

on writing with the installation of a
writing lab. However. the cloud of
the court battle did hurt recruitment
here, also.

"The case certainly had a negative
effect on this campus," said O'beary.
The longer it went on. the more dif-
ﬁculties it caused us.“

Why did this case go on. and was
it worth its detrimental effect on
SUNYA?

“I really can‘t answer whether it
was worth it," said O‘Leary. “It was
the decision of the SUNY Board of
Trustees, it wasn't decided on this
campus.'They weighed the problem
of negative publicity and decided to
go foward with it."

There were several issues brought
up by the court battle between
SUNY and the Board of Regents.
The most obvious one was whether
the Commissioner had the right to
close down a program within the
SUNY system. SUNY contended
that the Master Plan. adevelopmen-
tal document of SUNY which is ap-
proved by the Board of Regents and
the governor every four years. placed
final responsibility of programswith
the Board of Trustees.

The courts disagreed with SUNY
each time — by wide margins.

“l have never read a decision that
was so clear and unequivocable as
this decision," said Nyquist.

“It is now clear that the Regents
can register and de~register SUNY
program." said SUNY attorney
Walter J. Relihan.

Relihan added. however that the ‘

issue is not so “open and closed"as it
seems. SUNY also questioned the
speciﬁc criteria with which the Com-
missioner based his decisions to de-
register the History and English
program. In this case. it was found
that there were sufficient standards
by which the English and History
program Were gauged.

This was not surprising. In the
case of th's institution's History and
English programs. not many people,
including members ofSUNYA. were
claiming that the programs were of
tremendous standards. However. it
did force the Regents to show that
they had judged the program by suf-
ﬁcient and fair standards.

Relihan. however. was not totally
satisfied. “The standards were not
pro-existing statutes. They could be
arbitrary decisions. with a variety of
factors involved."

The case ofSUNYA's History and
English program takes on additional
characteristics when one looks at the
personalities involved. When the

.final review assigned the “to be ter-
minated“ rating. it contained some
. positive and some negative remarks

about the two programs. Nyquist
took only the negative parts of the
report. while Ernest Boyer. who was
the SUNY Chancellor at the time.
chose to highlight the positive
aspects. Nyquist terminated the
programs. and SUNY then took ac-
tion, prom'aing to appeal it all the
way on the state level. As the two
educational authorities locked horns
in a power struggle. strong
statements were not unusual by both
sides.

In the middle was Emmett Fields
and SUNYA. Fields felt the
programs shouldn‘t have been ter-
minated and made his bold promises
of knocking on Commissioners'
doors.

It is up to conjecture as to whether
the same thing would have happened
if today's cast of characters. Am-
bach. O‘Leary and SUNY
Chancellor Clifton Wharton were at
the helm.

According to Relihan. the
problem might have been settled had
there been different personalities in-
volved. “The case was close to being
settled.“ Relihan said. “But it got
caught up in the issue of standards
and whether they should be set.
whether there should be written
SED standards.“

The fact that there aren't any
specific standards for programs
makes it difficult to assess whether a
program has reached the SED level
or not. The negative rating given to
the Chemistry program after a three
year probation is a key example.
Nobody said that the program
hadn't improved considerably since
SED put it on a three year
probationary period. It wasn't a
question of whether the program
had improved. it was whether or not
it had improved enough.

Immediately after the unfavorable
rating was given to the Chemistry
Department last year. O'Leary set up
Mmittcc of the Graduate

Academic Council‘to monitor all of v
the doctoraliprogrgmsﬁ beforeéthe:
SED'gets a’ ciacli’it them. “Damnit.” ’
O'Leary said in an interview right
after the Chemistry loss, “We’re, the.
ﬁrst ones who have, to make
decisions about quality here, not
people outside.” - ,
Resources will have to
allocated and priorities will have to
beset. While Fields was restruc-
turing the English Department,
there were rumblings Within the
department because junior faculty
members were being let go to free up
faculty lines and money for recruit-
ment of heavyweights. The cry was
that in order to build up its graduate
programs. SUNYA was taking away
from its undergraduate programs.
As far as students are concerned.
pure numbers would support this
statement. For all of the rhetoric and
legal hassles over English and
History. the number of students

enrolled in both programs could
easily fit into a SUNYA green bus.

But. then, should SUNYA forget
its pursuit of the graduate programs
and eventually become acollege in—
stead?

Ewald Nyquist says yes. He sees
SU NYA as“not a complete universi-
ty". but a "strong undergraduate in-
stitution which should take another
look atitself and its priorities."

His opinion. however. is a minori-
ty one. Clifton Wharton. in h'm visit

O‘Leary said. "That's what maltei a
university center. that's our responé
sibility." .

Now that the court battles are
over, SUNYA is “freed up" to pursue
doctoral programs in History and
English. according to Vice President
for Academic Affairs David Martin.
“During the court‘proceedings, we
were in a state of suspended anima-
tion," he said. “We're now free to see
what we want to do."

Shortly after SUNYA suspended
Chemistry.0' Leary said:
“ Everybody on this campus has one
stake in everything that goes on.
That stake is quality. It's the most
important damn thing. Not so much
what you are, but that What you are
is quality. That's the most important
thing I owe to a student.“

So now the rebuilding. if it is to be,
will begin. O'Leary is determined to
stay away from any of the negative
publicity SUNYA has had to suffer
in the past years. And it's a good bet
that before they are brought up
before the SED for a new review. the
English and History programs. as
well as the Chemistry program. will
not have to be up to the SED levels.
They will have to exceed them.
