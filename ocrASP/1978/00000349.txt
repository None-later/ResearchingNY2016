NO BARKING MATTER

Dogs ‘have been discriminated
against for a long time, but a new rul-
ing by a Los Angeles judge may do
away with animalism.

1Citing the 14th Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution, Judge Mario
Gonzales has ruled that dogs no
longer need to be licensed in Los
'Angeles. Judge Gonzales says that
since .there are no similar re-
quirements forcing the licensing of
canaries, turtles, pigs, chipmucks,
cats or any other household pets, the
City of Los Angeles can no longer
discriminate against canine
Americans by requiring that only
they be licensed.

Gonzales said the continued licen-
sing of dogs would be a denial of “A
citizen's right tqequal protection un-
der the law.“ And that‘s no barking
matter!

WORK QUIRKS

A survey of the work attitudes of
23.000 Psychology Today readers
has found that most of those who
responded are very much wrapped
up in themselves.

The study was coordinated by Un-
iversity of Michigan Psychologist

Edward Lawler and University of

California Administrator Patricia

Renwick for the.magazine. .

The survey found that those
questioned are self—oriented. and dis-
play little of the socialconsciousness
prevalent among young people in the
1960's. »

It also found that the typical
worker is more concerned about
decision making opportunities and
interesting and challenging work
than she or he is about social reform.

The survey reports that 43 percent
of those who responded felt that they
had been victims of job discrimina-

‘ zone news

tion in the last ﬁve years, but 2 per-
cent opposed any Afﬁrmative Ac-
tion programs.

And ﬁnally, the survey concluded,
that despite the influence of the
Women‘s Movement. men‘s careers
still come ﬁrst in two career families
and women still do most of the
housework.

SPACE CADET§

If you want to get an idea of whats
UFO-naut, one of those creatures
that might pilot an unidentiﬁed
flying object. looks like, Astronomer
J. Allen Hynek can probably tell
you.

Hynek says that UFO-nauts are
not the traditional little green men of
science fiction fantasy.

On the contrary. he reports. based
on the records of 60,000 sightings he
has studied, UFO occupants are
probably silver-gray in color. not
green. are three to four feet tall." and
have large eyes and heads.

In short. Hynek describes the
visitors from outer space as
“resembling overgrown goblins.“

EYE CONTACT

Two researchers at the University
of Tennessee say they have un-
covered a connection betWeen the
color ofa person‘s eyes and thatper-
son's willingness to be open with
strangers.

Psychologists A.L. Gary and
Lloyd Davis report an experiment

with 32 counselor trainees that

found that dark-eyed or brown-eyed
subjects tended to start off shnring
their most intimate self-disclosures
and stayed self-disclosing
throughout the study. They add that
blue-eyed people tended to be up-
tight or guarded about their feelings
at first. but eventually shared their
innermost feelings as the study
progressed.

The two researchers are quoted by
Human Behavior magazine as
suggesting that the pigment,
melanin. which determines eye color
also plays a direct role in emotional
make—up.

MA JOCK

Athletic woman apparently have a
much easier time during childbirth
than non-athletic women.

Ms. Magazine quotcsa I962 study
of 729 female athletes which found
that 87 percent of the women had
faster deliveries than did their non-
athletic counterparts.

The magazine quotes medical
writcrs J.G.P. Williams and I’.N.
Spcrryn as saying that athletic
women have quick deliveries. little
pain and shorter convalescenecs
following childbirth. .

Ms. says that athletic mothers
seem to benefit from the improved
circulation which is vital to the
growth of the fetus and front their
improved muscle tone. which speeds
delivery.

SAT'DAY NITE HI
High Time: magazine is claiming
that marijuana is the secret in-

gredient behind NBC’s Saturday'

Night Live show.

in an interview with the magazine,
Laraine Newman. a member of the
show‘s Not Ready For Prime Time
Players. alleges that the actors are
stoned. the writers are stoned, and
many people in the studio and home

The 26-year-old comedienne told
High Times that being stoned on pot
“is part of our orientation; that's part
of the way we write...pot is an
introspective high." she says, “and it
makes me creative. 1 can work on
pot, write on it and create on it."

the winner of an Addy for designing
the best advertisements in the print
medium promoting a single product.

SINFUL SEX STUDY

Seven in lo women consider
extra—marital sex “sinful.”A smaller
ttumber of these women, however,
consider premarital sex sinful.

This is the result ofa poll by Me-
Call's magazine, which says it sur-
veyed some 60.000 women of all
faiths. ages and incomes on sex.

While more than two-thirds of the
women objected to extra-marital
sex, McCall's reports that barely
half. or 53 percent, considered
premarital sex objectionable. Two-
thirds of the women responding to
the survey. however, categorized
homosexuality as sinful, unethical of
immoral.

The magazine says that, generally.
poorer women emerged in the poll as
having stricter moral standards than
their wealthier sisters.
