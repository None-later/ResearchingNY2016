Attica Brother

by Kate Livingston

" We exposed the Injustice of the entire
prison system. When you come in here
[prison] they feel that you've committed a
crime in society. When in the meantime it was
society that closes the door beforehand——
doors into education and knowledge. And if
you submit yourself to the physical and
psychological repression that keeps these
places alive, you become very vulnerable to
losing your own self-dignity. Everyday I have
to maintain my sanity—in an insane place—
really . . . Because I've had plans for a long
It me for when Iget out. Basically my plans are
to . . . help the young to help the old. to help
the people get back what is rightfully ours.

The words of a Soviet dissident? They could
be—but they are the words of Daoajeweiah, a
young Native American and one of America‘s
political prisoners.

Dacajcweiah (John Hill) was convicted of
killing a guard at Attica in the I971 prison
rebellion. That rebellion left 42 unarmed men.
inmates and hostages, dead and hundreds of
wounded after a brutal assault on the prison
by state troopers. sheriffs‘ deputies and prison
guards. Although Governor Carey granted
Dacajcwciah clemency in 1976, this act merely
gave Dacajeweialt an audience before the
Parole Board. The Board promptlyrefused his
release. thereby making a ﬁnal mockery of
Carey‘s attempt to “close the books on
Attica.“

The “books on Attica" don't make for

4 pleasant reading~those books that have been
open to the public, that is. The Bell Report.
. -.‘ two volumes of the Meyer Report, and the

Albright-Vestncr report have been held from

public scrutiny by government ofﬁcals. Why?
lhe New York State Special Commission of
Attica said of the rebellion: “With the
exception of Indian massacres in thelate l9th
Century, the State Police assault which ended
the four-day prison uprising was the bloodiest
one—day encounter between Americans since
the Civil War."

And the US. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit termed the aftermath of Attica

"an orgy of brutality“ by police against

 

inmates. The real facts behind Attica will only
expose the brutality of the ofﬁcals responsible
for the injustice that has taken place—from
Rockerfeller to Carey. By denying the people
the truth, by closing the doors to knowledge,
as Dacajeweiah says, Carey has put a prison
wait around all of us.

i

 

Like Attica and the many men who
struggled against the repression evident in
censorship. denial of visitors. slave wages in
prison shops, worthless vocational training.
the prison walls cannotcontain the strength of
truth and the power of people seekingjustice.
It took ﬁve years of unrelenting pressure on
state officals to get the facts behind Attica out
in the open. Victory was achieved for many of
teh Attica Brothers when the state was forced
to drop the indictments, to dismiss the
trumpth up charges. But fullvictoryis not yet
ours. Dacajeweiah remains imprisoned for 20
years to life, and the Parole Board. the
Governor. and officials in the corrections
system are not likely to give up this last
scapegoat for the crimes at Attica.

On July 25. an important motion was filed
in State Supreme Court as part of the
continuing effort to free Dacajcweiah. That
motion seeks dismissal ofhis conviction on the
groun_ds that the prosecution bythe state “was
so tainted as to constitute a gross violation of
Dacajeweiah‘s rights as guaranteed by the
Constitution of the United States." The

motion cites a number of secret reports that
were denied the defense during Dacajeweiah’s
trail. but which outline the state's program of
selective prosecution. immediately following
the rebellion of I97], Rockerfeller ordered a
secret report. the Albright-Vestner report, to
be drawn up. This was released to the public
through the Buffalo newspapers last month. it
contains eye-witness accounts of the death ofa
guard. William Quinn. whose murder
Dacajeweiah is charged with, and testimony
that differs from that presented by the
. prosecution in Dacajeweiah's trial. These
important early statements by key witnesses
Were never presented in court nor givento the
defense. Nor was this report ever made
available to any subsequent commission
examining evidence surrounding the Attica
rebellion.

in addition the motion contains a
supporting affidavit from former Attica
prosecutor Malcolm Bell, who resigned in
protest of the state's selective prosecution.
Bell‘s afﬁdavit details knowncrimes of murder
and attempted murder committed by known
troopers and guards, the interference of the
state police in collecting and processing
evidence of these crimes. and the role of the
Chief Attica Prosecutor in blocking the
presentation ofavailable evidence to the grand
jury.
This sudden and timely release of the secret
Albright-Vestner report and Bell‘s afﬁdavit
will be part ofa major court action to bringthe
issue of selective prosecution before a court
which could order Dacajeweiah's release. His
victory. however. will be like that ofthe sixty
other Attica Brothers whose indictments
brought by the state were dropped after
massive public support for the Attica Brothers
was brought to bear on responsible public
officals. The injustice that stings the wounds
of Blacks. Native Americans. Latinos,and the
poor comes from the cop on the street,
through the courts, to the White House. No
political prisoners in this country, Mr. Carter?
We shall raise our voices louder. then, from
the chronicles of history to the Wilmington I0,
to Attica and now. Free Dacajeweiah.

To the Edltor:

1 would like to take issue with the first
sentence in Bill Sobel‘s article “Saturday
Night Live“ in your first issue (Sept. 1). Being
a “townie”, I get more than a little offended
when the nine month visitors come down on
my city. Now, l'm sure Sobel just needed an
opening line which would set the reader in a

particular frame of mind. But it is deﬁnitely .

stupid for anyone who lives coopcd up in a
dorm to consider Saturday Night in
Albany dull! The nightlife here is not limited
to Washington and Western Aveenucs
exclusively, or even to Albany itself.
Granted. lots of students don‘t have wheels,
so they are stuck in the campus areas - but that

is their problem. There are a number of great .

clubs to party at between the tri-citics and
Saratoga. and I‘m not just talking about the
ones who advertise in the ASP and want
SUNYA business.

Concrt-wise. we‘ve been getting plenty

around here. And The Palace and Madison
theaters and other nightclubs are promising
