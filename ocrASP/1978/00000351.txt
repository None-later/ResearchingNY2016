'ith the release of their first

album in 1977 The Talking

Heads established themselves

as one of the promising bands

to emerge from the New Wave
genre. Unlike the majority of punk their
songs are sophisticated. diverse and well
written. actually it is difficult to
categorize The Talking Heads as punk.
David Byrne, the group‘s principle song
writer denies that classification. They can
be classified as punk only in so far as they
capture its essence; a rebellion against the
pretentious, artificial music which has
become the mainstay of the seventies.
Really, the Talking Heads are beyond the
punk movement as they do not sacrifice
diversity and sophistication in their
music.

 

Gary Douglas

 

Their second album, More Songs
About Buidings and Food is, however,
somewhat ofa disappointment. With this
album, produced under the guidance of
the noted avantgarde mustcian, Brian
Eno, the group has taken a noticeable
different turn. Eno does not, however,
accentuate the group‘s strong points as a
producer should, but instead steers them
in a direction which is not their terrain.

Talking Heads main asset is their
inspired songwriting and unique style of
arrangement. Eno, however, is into sound
manipulation. He explores

unconventional melodic and 'harmonic

is prevalent on the album. As a result the
effect ofthc group‘s songwritingis diluted
and only two or three simple,straight-.-

album.

it is absurd and self—destructive for the
Heads to explore this area of the Avant
Garde. They do not havea specialafﬁnity
for it. it seems as if the group took a
number of conventional song and
Injected them with sophisticated sound
manipulations. The results are long,
drawn out, compositions that seem to
lack purpose. The formula scents to be the
same for every song. Repetition of several
themes, interjected with electronic
sounds, offbeat rhythms, and simple
melodies carefully placed and arranged in
order to develop tenison and release in an
unusual pace. Somewhere, woven into
the midst of all this, are conventional
songs which have been picked apart
disected, and turned inside out. Although
'mteresting, this scents to be an attempt to
be different and avant gardc without
reason or jUSl cause.
The album does have its high points

examples of the kind of inspired song
writing with’just the right touch of the
unconventional which brought about the
refreshing sound on the Talking Head‘s
ﬁrst album.

The Big Country is a sarcastic ballad
which pokes fun at America. Tacheto
the River is a bluesy rock song done with
a touch of imagination and originality
reminiscent of some early seventies rock
groups i.e. Trafﬁc. The Good Thing is
exactly that, with apowerfulrefrain sung
by a strong backup vocal section.

Talented as they are, the Heads do not
handle their Eno inspired exploration too
badly. in Warning Sign, the group makes
a fine entrance into the avant garde,
employing electronic sounds develop
interesting harmonic texture over which a
haunting melody is heard. Long, low,
electronic sounds support short stacatto.
then legato melody lines. The electronic
sounds create a captivating feeling of
motion that leads the listener past the
haunting melody sung by Byrnc who does
all the lead vocals.

But this is Eno’s specialty and it one
wants to hear this sort ofthing one should
listen to a Brian Eno album. More .‘i‘onyr

expectations raised after heir first album.

Who Are You
n a recent interview. Mick
Jagger claimed that his and
Pete Townsend‘s bands were
both “very fragile at the
moment." With the release of
Sonic Girls. The Rolling Stones have
proven that an “ancient” rock ‘n roll band
can, after three years out of the studio,
make a classic recording for 1978.
Unfortunately, The Who can‘t, and Who
Are You is an almost tragic ending to a
great rock tale. Their first recording in
three years, and possibly their last as well,
is a disappointing attempt to insure fans
that although this group is old, they can
still play with youthfulfervor. As a matter
of fact, youth is exactly what is missing on
this record.

Indeed, the group seems quite aware of
the fragility Jagger speaks of, which
makes it allthe worse. Whiletheinl;enlus
Stones reacted with an incredibly
"current" hit single to give them a Solid
base for the eighties, The Who insisted on
remaining obsessed with their age. imd

Everyone knows that this group is old, in

Writing songs with .titles such as “NOW

he scene is Private?
Collegesville, U.S.A. Picture
yourself unloading your
suitcases from your car and
bringing all of your belongings
to a quaint, old dormitory nestled in the
middle of a genuine college town. You
notice that there's something unusual]
about your car. it is the only one with a‘
New York license plate on it. After a
semester, you have met people from every
state in the Union including Hawaii and
Alaska, and you come home with a
strange accent and a deep appreciation of
the way everyone from different
backgrounds can co-exist.

'Thomas Martello

 

 

The scene shifts to Albany State. Here
you drive your car on a round road which
leads to a symmetrical jungle. You

with the weather station on the tower. As

purchased box of Frichoffers, you hear a
voice bellow, "Hey, didn‘t I see you at
Roosevelt Field the other day?“ You
reply, “Yeah, I was hangin‘ out there
before catching the Good Rats at My
Father's Place." The guy you're talking
with mutters a quick “intense” and “See
ya‘ around“ before escaping to his suite.
You then know that although you‘ve
trekked over 200 miles from your beloved
“Long island“. you really haven‘t left
home at all.

Of course, both of these scenes aren‘t

itelling the whole truth. The colleges

which are the stereo-typed “national

melting pots“ are few and far between,

and probably aren‘t as good as their

brochures make them out to be.

And although Albany State has been

called “Long Island North“ by many

students, not all are from downstate. in

fact, Albany State, nestled near the

crossroads of the New York State

Thruway, is indeed quite a melting pot.

Yes, Albany State, with its 95 percent

enrollment from New York State, is a'
melting pot. You see, here can be found

two definite types of folk: the upstater

and the downstater.

Before we get into the differences
between upstatch and downstaters, it is
essential that we designate what
constitutes upstate and downstate. Long
Island (better known to most as “lawn

 

 

Guyland“) is definitely downstate. So is

New York City. Most people agree that
Westchestcr fits into that category,
although some die-hard downstaters
claim that North of the Bronx is upstate.
Movc north into Rockland County, and
you‘re getting into limbo-land. [t can fit
into both categories. although we can go
for the gusto and include it in downstate
because of its closeness to New York City.
Everything else is upstate. Buffalo may
be west of New York, and Albany may be
south of the Adirondacks, but it's all
deeply embedded on mainland U.S.A.
Therefore it is upstate
Now that we‘ve named the
geographical areas, it's time to mix the
people. Enter the stereotyped
downstater. The Datsun 280-2 is
cluttered with 081 stickers and disco is
blaring from the tape deck. His (or her)
hair is dark, and the clothes are all name-
brands...you know, stuff like Sassoon
jeans. He‘ll also "tauk" very fast. AST]
Now it‘s time for the stereotyped
upstater. it‘s a pickup truck that provides
the transportation and Marshall Tucker
wails some country rock tunes. Clad in
overalls and blonde hair which has not
been to a $15 dollar stylist, this person
will smile and move at a slow pace.
How much ofthis is true? Are upstaters
all farm-grown hicks and downstaters
japped out city—slickers'!

“Before I met them, I thought all
upstatcrs were straight off the farm,"snid
Phoebe Glabmen. who lives in New York
City. Another downstater, who remained
nameless. said this of upstaters: “They all
can drink beer w I‘ve seen ‘em drink two
beers at once. They talk funny and they
look alike. They‘re all big, have beer
bellies, wear overalls, workhoots and tee-
shirts."

“Downstatcrs, they're all pushy, loud-
mouthed and into impressing everyone,“
said one upstater.

Enough of the potshots. There are
some basic differences and attitudes that
are prevalent and stir up a friendly rivalry
between the two factions. One is
language. Both sides claim the other has
the accent. Although there is a basic
difference between the way someone from
Albany talks and the way someone from
Buffalo talks, to someone who lives in
Queens it‘s one and the same thing. And
both the persons from Buffalo and
Albany will laugh at the way the
Queensitc will pronounce, for instance,
the word “wauter”.

Jerry O‘Connor of Cohoes sees a
deﬁnite absence of“R‘s" in the diet ofthc
downstate language. “That letter is a hard
one to pronounce, and with the quick
pace of the way people talk down there, it
becomes lost. Upstaters talk slower,

  

therfore we pronounce our “R's”. Also an

upstater will stand “in line', while a

downstater will stay 'on line‘. ‘
Another difference is lifestyle. “I ﬁnd

' that a majority of downstaters treat

school too seriously,“ said Keith Bishop
of Schenectady. “Many are overly
concerned with grades."

“U pstaters are more calm and live at a
slower pace,“ said Long island’s Deborah
Riser. “i get hyper all the time, but my
roommate, who‘s from a small town, is
always calm." Coming to Albany had
some changes for Deborah, however.
Like the time she watched the local news
broadcast and was very surprised that the
sportscaster would not lead off with the
Yankees or the Red Sox. but whether
Cohoes High will have a decent record
this year.

it‘s definitely not like down in “The
City, where there‘s six TV stations and
webs“ teams and...and...

“That‘s one thing that hugs me,“said a
proud upstater. “it‘s always “The City‘ or
‘The Island‘. it‘s as ifthere isn‘t any other .
city.,‘ To which a big apple resident
immediately replied, “There isn't.“

“There isn‘t as much to do up here,

Ithat‘s for sure," said Matt Murray of
Albany. “Soyoujust gotta be resourceful,
i guess.“

“There are more discos per acre
downstate.“ said Bob Gardner.

“Upstatcrs seem to communicate more.
Downstatcrs are more uptight,“ said
Lawrence Barnett of New York City.
“There are too many people down there.
so they fight and bitch. In small towns
people wave to you. Not downstate.“
Barnett, however would not want to live
anywhere but New York City, because
“it's the best place in the world.“

"At the very beginning there was a
language barrier, said Deborah.
“Upstatch say stuff like ‘wicked‘ and
‘dcccnt‘, and it rubs off on you.“

And does the downstate style rub offon
upstaters also? Living together proviedes
much social interaction and exchanging
of values.

Which leads us to our ﬁnal scene. it‘s
the end of the semester and this guy heads
out to leave...he‘s got a Mandarin collar
shirt on and plays “Macho Man“ on the
radio...“ Bye, guys, it‘s been good, huh,“
he says very quickly while kicking around
in his Frye boots. He waves goodbye,
whistling a tune from island god Billy
Joel, then drives away...to his parent's
farm in Watervliet.
