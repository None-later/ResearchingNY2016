he varied styles of Allen Harris
and his band are difﬁth to
characterize. Of course, such a
position can be either
damaging or advantageous,

I! ‘hat "who" is seldom any large, collective
roup.
Fortunately, Allen Harris handles it to
n advantage. While his music is a
ixture of multitudinous pop styles,
hroughout Oceans Between Urtherc is a
" ohesive versatility which makes the
Ibum both pleasant and entertaining.
‘he sharp edges have been tucked under

. Vho, and you'll either hear Tommy or

Quadrophenia. Who Are You is an
ittempt to throw away the past and point
awards the future. Instead, the album
backfires, and the result is that we still
hink of old Who first.

But what exactly is wrong with this
ccord'? The Who By Numbers, although
it no way earth shattering or historic,
‘ unded a lot better to me than the new
, release when comparing first impressions
‘A. of each. And The Who By Numberr has
held up well after three years. For one
thing, the older release was more basic
and raw. Who Are You has been lavishly
produced, and although this isn't

sounding gaudy here. The synthesizers
have been turned up a bit too much, and
Townsend‘s guitar, usually a solid
backbone, is given no speciﬁc place.
Producer Glyn Johns, within the same
ong, will have it loud in the forefront,.
and then soft and unimposing. The result
is strange: The synthesizer stands out
-' ahead of the guitar, and the guitar loses its
power and drive completely.
And speaking of the guitar, what is the
 story of Pete Townsend at the moment?
1’ I Regardless of the production, much can
be said about what Townsend is playing.
It seems to me as if he's toying with the
. 3 instrument lately. I get the impression
' hat he really doesn‘t enjoy playing the
hing anymore. What happened to the
: towmend of yesteryear, slamming a pick
 at the strings, hitting all six full force,
,, creating a wall of sound? It's simply not
there. It has been replaced by lazy riffs,
and rehashings of played out solos.
While Mick Jagger seems able to
'scape his age, Pete Townsend seems
rapped in his. His attempt to increasethe
g ynthesizer input over guitar isjustiliabie.
3 He‘s trying to modernize the sound. And
hile his modernization has succeeded,
» c has unfortunately modernized stale
‘ deas. The reverse of this would probably
t. t ave succeeded: A bunch of new ideas

I' he Stones, anyway.

tune, moving from a meek, mild, love

complete with slei'ghbells, that is very

tends to bring listeners to their feet.

Who Me has

uncommon for the group, it comes off:

. re . . . . . . . . . »
» . .. ' - ‘r,‘. .v.'.'. . (no.1, , .

song to a majestic ballad of broken

dreams. Deﬁnitely hit potential.
Another good selection is "Snow

Blind," a strange up—tempo rocker,

danceable (like much of the album). It

“Broadway Life" is another ballad,
only much more contemporary. On ﬁrst
listening one might be reminded of
Springsteen. or perhaps even Lou Reed.
The song is right off the street, alive and
gasping for air.

"All In A Dream" is a pleasant
diversion from much of the album's rock
and roll. A charming latin melody
featuring a Miss Christine Cordone on’
vocals makes this tune the most Iistenable
of the collection.

 

“ Borderline“. A bizarre, electronics heavy
rocker, this song is bound to be a favorite.
It might be compared to Jagger‘s
“Dancing With Mr. D“ or Zappa‘s “I'm
the Slime.“ The tune is so evil and
awesome it tends to turn heads wherever
it‘s played. It should receive considerable
FM attention.

The re mainder of Oceans Between Us is
likewise original and entertaining.
Despite the schizophrenia of styles
throughout, the album remains
captivating and whole. The Allen Harris
band has no dclinite style. Instead, they
dih and dab. Don‘t let that frighten you
away. You‘re bound to like some of it.

And if he can't come up with new ideas,
then maybe he is too old to continue. His
recent loss of hearing also doesn‘t help
matters. With Pete Townsend telling
interviewer after interviewer that he‘s in
constant pain and can‘t hear well, how
can we take his group‘s LP seriously! We
simply can‘t.

The album. however, is not a totalloss.
Roger I)altrcy can still churn out a vocal
ol'considemble impact, in his classic style
of tight crudcness. On “Music Must
Change." a good cut despite its title,
Daltrey treats us to a divided vocal
beginning with a low key, but driven
opening, and then rises to a fierce peak for
the chorus. The sequence is repeated once
again for the latter half of the song, and
it‘s so good compared to the rest of the
LP, that it‘s a pleasure to hear it repeated.

The other superior cut is "Guitar and
Pen " Reminiscent of the Tommy(dare I
mention him?) period, it's a funky tune
along the lines of “Sally Simpson."

The title CU! Icloses: the album, and
leaves one with a strange feeling. It‘s a
good song, but it adheres to all the bad
characteristics I‘ve mentioned
throughout. The song, like the group. is a
sort of paradox. Greatness gone wrong.

The ﬁnal result is a blunt question of
fear: Who Are You. Four old pros trying
to stick it out and find themselves again.
They asked the question, but it has no
question mark. It's now a statement. They
expect no answer; they accept the fact
that they'll never know. I‘ll miss The
Who.
