retail
rip off

To the Editor:

The annqu rip-off and rake-in has begun.
courtesy of the SUNYA bookstore.

While most college bookstores (such us the
famous Harvard Co-op near Boston) are
dedicated to reducing prices and assuring
discounts for the student. the SUNYA store in
contrast exploits students for maximum
profit. The top retail prices are charged on
most tcxtbooksHWith no sign ofdiscounting.
'l‘hc some is true regarding school supplies.
The following is a case in point:

At a CVS/Mnck Drugstore, u 200 sheet. 5
subject notebook costs $1.19. At the SUNY

bookstore. a 100 sheet notebookcoots 81.25;»)

150 sheet. 3 subject notebook runs $1.75.
Concerned students might begin taking
action by not enriching those who seek to rip
them off, and make their purchases elsewhere.

outto
lunch

To the Editor:

In order to get a locker at the gym, you have
to pay an eight dollar towol fee. After paying
the eight bucks. you‘rcentitlcd too new, cleanr
bright, fresh-smelling. wondcrous and
wonderful towel each and every time you go to
the gym. Unless. that is you go to the gym
between 10:30 and 11:00 AM. Thurs whenthe
towel person takes her lunch break.

“This is absurd." l shouted. “My gym class
ends at 10:30cvcry Monday and Wednesday.‘

The gym's response: “She's human. She has
to eat lunch.“

Thankfully, the entire university doesn't
close up during staff members' lunch hour. (it
would be especially annoying if the cafeteria
workers took off during lunch.) Obviosly the
woman has to cut. But somewhere in their
budget. the gym can find in dollar or two per
day to fill the void.

Councilpersons
At Work

 

 

The Student’s eRl hts  ,  

Equal representation in governmen as been one of the cornerstones
of our democracy ever since its inception. But on June 16, a new chair
was appointed to an organization which has been denying‘SUNYA
students just that right year after year. For it was that day. when the
Governor tapped an attorney named Thomas Whalen to be the chair of
SUNYA’s University Council.

The post which Mr. Whalcn has been named to is one of the most
powerful within the SUNYA community. He is the new chair of a body
responsible for selecting Presidents of this institution, a process this
school is too familiar with. .

The former chair, .1. Vanderbilt Straub, presided over the selection of
three SUNYA Presidents, a job which obviously had a direct and
immediate effect on all students here. But when it came time to replace
him because of retirement, SUNYA students were faced with accepting a
man who, qualifications aside, was an unknown to them. Couldn’t the ‘ -'
students at least been given the chance to have an open forum with Mr.
Whalen, to get some idea of who he is?

it would seem that in a university setting, openneSS would be the rule
rather than the exception. Once again though, SUNYA has proved that
to be a rule which is broken, not kept.

Even more reprehensible however, is the fact that there is no real
effective voice for the students on the University Council. True, SA
President Paul Feldman is a non-voting member, but what kind of
representation is that? Mr. Whalen himself should be commended for
supporting the idea of giving the student member a vote, and the State
legislature should follow his recommendation.

it is time that SUNYA students were given a say in the matters that
most affect them. What more important council could there be at a
university than one responsible for selecting new presidents, presenting
annual budgets, and reviewing plans for faculty, expansion? I

With no voting representation on this council, students are being
denied something they have come to expect ever since their first days
back in elementary school history classes. isn‘t it then after all, when
Americans first start learning about equal representation? it’s time the
Governor and the Legislature started remembering their fundamentals
about democracy. '

Just because students are transient, here for a short time when
compared to many faculty and administrators, it does not follow that
they deserve no say in such an organization. After all, is SUNYA being
run for the people behind the desks in the offices, or in the lecture

centers?
