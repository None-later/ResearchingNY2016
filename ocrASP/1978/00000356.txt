rye-W '

by Rlch Sellpon \ ~ -

Several 30-60 second commercial spots appear frequently between
innings of the Monday Night ABC-TV Baseball broadcasts. One
promo features Vida Blue rootingfor his surprising Giant teammates
from outside the dugout. while another focuses on the $38,000 a year
San Diego Chicken, seen dancing and prancing an the dugout_

And behind each of these promos, there is one continuous sound—
the noise of the enthusiastic fans who are cheering, yelling, screaming,
ranting and raving. No matter how you describe it, there‘s one
common bond—ENJOYMENT.

A visual piece is seen at the end of each promo. It reads, Basede
Fever. Catch It. The roars of the crowd continue. Back to you,
Howard.

This column will propose a different variation of the phrase: Albany
State Fever. Start It. We have a problem here at SUNYA. There are a
lot of sports fans, but their main concern is whether the Yankeu Wm
catch Boston or will the Mets ever come up with a winning streak.

Just see what happens on a Monday night on campus when a TV
lounge is converted to a football stadium forthree hours. As indicated
last spring in this column, athletics is a great outlet; playing and
watching sports can keep one‘s mind off their work load.

What‘s being suggested here is not to give up your enthusiasm for
professional sports, but to expand your role as a fan to that of Albany
intercollegiate sports. For openers. in the full, you can watchthe '77
NCAA Division III Semifinalists football Danes(tomorrowthere‘sa
scrimmage against a highly touted Middlcbury squad), and attend the
soccer games which pits the hooters against the best competitionthat
any Danes‘ team faces.

The baseball team could definitely use the fans also. and that goes
for the tennis teams and cross country teams, as well. When the winter
rolls around (hopefully it will take its time) there's a new selection of
spectator sports you can choose from. Beginning with a basketball
squad that defeated the second-ranked Division III team in the nation
twice in one Week last year, and continuing with the wrestling,
swimming, and vollyball teams. There are still more; seek and you‘ll
probably ﬁnd.

As the pro sports continue from season to season so does college
athletics. We have a long way to go before spring—I‘ll hold off.

This whole new concept of contagious fan involvement dependson
the Albany State fan, but also on the Athletic Department. Newspaper
coverage cannot provide everything. Publicity in the form of signs and
large white sheets that advertise the big games should hang from the
inside and outside ofthe Campus Center. The cheerleaders and the Pop
Squad, as their titles indicate, should also help in this effort. And when
these different groups take steps to increase fan awareness and
capacity crowds eventually become a reality at games, Albany State
can then change their promos to Albany State Fever. Got It.

For beginners, how about cross country couch Bob Munscy singing
during halftime of ltomc football games. The fans would go wild.

 

 

 

 

' New~ Y ark-Boston Series '=

BOSTON (AP) Winners 12 times in
the last 14 games, the New York
Yankees opened a crucial — for
them — series against the first-place

Boston Red Sox Thursday at Fenway.

Park. Boston. which has lost five of
seven. holds a three-game lead over
the Yankees in the American
League's East Division.

“If we win, nobody can beat us,"
said Red Sox Manager Don Zimmer
Wednesday night after Boston beat
Baltimore 2-0 ona two—hitter by Luis
Tiant.

“At home. you like to do better,"
said Carl Yastrzemski, who backed
Tiant with a two-run homer. “But I'd
be satisﬁed with a split."

Yankees reliever Rich Gossage
has set his sights somewhat higher.
“Hopefully. we can beat them four
straight,“ he said. "But we‘d be hap-
py with three out of four."

That would whittle Boston's edge
to two games, with three games
remaining between the clubs —- at
New York, Sept. 15-l7.

The Yankees, disscnsion-wracked
and struggling under Billy Martin
but a powerhouse after Bob Lemon
replaced him on July 25, have won
18 of 23 and 3| of44 since the mild-
mannercd manager took charge.

“You never know what‘s going to
happen." said Lemon. "This is my
4lst year in the game and nothing
ceases to give mt: a thrill or amaze
me." Catfish Hunter, who seems to
have come back from a two-year bat-
tlc with arm trouble, says the same
thing. “Everyone should unders-
tand, I feel this series is like Christ-
nuts.“

The same goes for Gossugc, the
Al. leader in saves with 22.

“We‘ve got to be excited about this
series,“ he said. “When we were 14
games out, everybody A including
the Red Sox 7» thought there would

be no contest. but now we're playing
our best ball.

New York was 14 games behind in
ﬁJuly. but has cut ll games off the
deﬁcit with its stretch drive, while
the Red Sox — crippled by injuries
in recent weeks - have faltered.

“A lot of clubs, when they go into

a bad streak, platoon their players.”_

said Zimmer. “But we're not a pla-
toon club."
So the lineup will be the same at

Yanks 15-

BOSTON (AP) Willie Randolph
drove in five runs. three witha bases-
loaded double, and the New York
Yankees exploded for 2| hits Thurs-
day night in a l5-3 victory over the
- Boston Red Sox.

Winning for the l3th time in their
last l5 games. New York moved
within three games of the first-place
Red Sox in the American League
East.

Randolph, Thurman Munson and
Roy White had three hits apiece as
the Yankees went on their biggest
hitting and scoring binge of the
season.

The Yankees made short work of
Boston starter Mike Torrezttnd con-
tinued their assault on Andy
Hassler, Dick Drago and Bill
Campbell.

Every New York batter except
reserve outfielder: Paul Blair and
Gary 'l'homasson had at least one hit
in helping hand the Red Sox their
seventh defeat inthc last nine games.

But, with New York in front l3-2

Fenway, where Boston has won 53 of
66 home games and shut out the op-
position eight times.

All that is lost on pantlme New
.York outﬁelder .lay Johnstone.

“All I know about Boston." he
said, "is my dad comes from there,
they talk funny there, and they have
good clam chowder."

They also have a team that has
beaten the Yankees five times in
eight games this season.

3 Winners

in the sixth, catcher Thurman Mun-
son was hit in the head by a pitch
thrown by Drago. Munson walked
from the ﬁeld. and the Yankees
reported he probably will be able to
return to the lineup Friday night.

a row.“

Lewis added three more goals for
the Danes. “We hope to improve on
our fourth-place finish in the Great
Dane Tennis Classic and on our l0th
plttcc finish in the ECAC Tourna—
ment.“ says Lewis. “We also hope to
win all of our dual matches in the
full."

The season opener takes place on
the Indian Quad Courts where ad-
ditional bleachers have been in-
stalled.

“We're looking for a better spec-
tator sport," says coach Lewis. “We
feel that we play an outstanding
brand of tennis and that people are
missing sornctltingifthcy don't come
out to set: us play."
