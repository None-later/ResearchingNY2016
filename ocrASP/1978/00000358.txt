Batmen _A re
Weakersed

By Ed Gibbons

It is a baseball axiom that pitching
is 75 percent of the game. if that's
true. Albany State's varsity fail
baseball team will be hard pressed to
meet the talent of last spring’s
9-9-1 squad.

With their top pitchers, Ed Sellers
and Bruce Dey, and their starting
catcher, Mike Mirabella, gone to
strengthen the football team, coach
Bob Burlingame looks to Jim
Bittker' and last spring‘s relief
pitchers, Paul Cohen and Gary
LaConture, to take over the pitching
this fall. Burlingame is also looking
for ex-junior varsity players, Rich
Woods, Mike Clabeaux and Tom Es-
posito to do some pitching.

Burlingame says he hopes Bittker,
the only starting pitcherwith anyex—
pcrience, can become a team leader
on the mound. “l‘m looking for Jim
to set an example out there
pitching," says Burlingame. Bittker,
a sophomore, realizes he has to pitch
well this season. He says, “1 know
l'm going to have to be a bigger pan
of this team's success. Some teams 1
think 1 can beat. but others could be
tough. 1 think we should be able to
score some runs this year though, so
we‘ll be tough.“

Aldrich & Paulo Named
Varsity Football Captains

"We‘ve had great captains since we've been here and they continue in
that line." said the only head coach in Albany State's nine—year foot ball
history about his team‘s newest leaders, quarterback Brad Aldrich and
corncrback Kenny Paulo. While such praise might seem hasty inlight
that the pair were elected captains only eight days ago. Rob Ford feels
that Aldrich and Paulo are up to the task.

“Kennv and Brad are two fine people,“ continued Ford. “i feel very
they're class people."

“l'm really happy with it,“ Aldrich said of his selection. “it goes

role. but now it‘s a little extra. 1 have alittle more burden on meto be a

Ford, who considers the leadership role ofcaptain as “tremendous,”
feels his senior players are “more or less a liason between the squad and

Paul Feldman, Larry Linett Lead
Seasoned Netmen; Five Return

By David Spiro

With five of their topeight players
returning, the Albany State tennis
team open: their fall season on
Wednesday hosting Oneonta.

“1 would say,“ says Danes' head
coach Bob Lewis, "thatwe should be
at least as strong as We were last year
(13-4), based on the improve-
ment of our players."

For the Danes, last year's number-
one, two, four, six and eight players
are all back for this season. The team
will be led by last year‘s one-two
combination of Paul Feldman and
Larry Linett. The two enjoy a
healthy competition for the number-
one spot which has helped both
players in their games.

Mike Fertig, Gene Gillespie and
Dave McMullen, last year‘s numer-
four, six, and eight players respec-
tively, also return to give the Danesa
very solid veteran team. “One of our
strengths,“ says Lewis“ “is our
team‘s experience."

However, the team is not without
its new blood. "We have a
freshman, “ says Lewis. “who has an
excellent chance to play as high as
number-three.“ He was referring to
Lane Lerner of Suffern, N.Y., who
lrasalready beaten Fertig in a playoff
match.

Another freshman, Allen
Weinberg of Hollis Hills and
sophomore (iary Light, who missed
last year‘s action, both have a shota
making the top six. Light in par-
ticular has rtll the strokes, according

' to Lewis, and needs only “match ex-
perience“ to break into the starting
six.

“1 think," says Lewis, “ that there
are as many as nthe guys) capable of
breaking into the top six." For the
Danes, none of the positions are en-
tirely set and playoff matches are
currently being played to help deter-
minlthe lineups.

“We are going to be very for-
midable at positions one, two and
three and steady at four," added
Lewis. "The question marks are at

five and six where we haven‘t had v

any proven winners yet.“

‘ Experlmental Pairing

1n doubles, only the team of Feld-
man and Fertig is set. Lewis is ex-

perimenting on a variety of com- » M
binations in order to determine the -

other pairings.

The Danes will participate inthree ‘
tournaments this fall including the -
SUNYAC Championships at ‘

Syracuse on Oct. 6and 7. Albany has
finished second in this tournament in
'76 and‘77, and first, the previous two
years. “We were really hurt by in-‘l
juries last year," says Lewis," and we
still came in second. Our goal this

year is to recapture the SU NYAC ti-‘

tlc."

Feldman. who had a 19-5 recor
last year. has a chance for individua
glory in the SU NYAC's. “He‘s got :3
chance to do something that h'
never been done," says Lewis. “H
can become the first player ever

Women Netters Open Play Today

By Jack Menz

The poster on Albany State
women‘s tennis coach Peggy Mann‘s
office reads, “Tennis isn't a matter of
life and death —- it‘s more important
than that." This quote accurately
reflects the intense work Mann's
team has put into the upcoming
season, which opens today at St.
Lawrence.

Sophomore Lisa Denemark leads
the quest to improve on last year's 7-
4 team mark. As a freshman,
Dencmark moved up tothc number-
onc singles spot midway through last
season. and posted a7-l record. This
year site will be aided by eight
returnees.

Back from ‘77 is number-two
singles player Jane Maloy. Maloy
offers not only talent [6-2 last
season), but also a wealth of ex-
perience; this is her fourth year on
the varsity. Captain Paula Sansville
is the only doubles player assured of
a starting berth as of'l'uesday. With
Sausville‘s 6-1 doublcs‘ record last

year, Albany can expect to be com-,

pctitive in doubles play.

Rounding out the con: of veterans
is Colleen Joyce. At 5-1 last fall,
Mann sees Joyce as a valuable asset
at either singles or doubles competi-
tion.

Mann has seen the level of com-
petition rise dramatically in her 15-
year stint as head coach. At that
time. three women tried out, and ac-
cording to Mario, "they had trouble
hitting the ball over the net."

tant coach Carol DeMetre. has cut

Board Increase To Be Proposed '

by Wendy Greenﬁeld

A proposalto increase board rates
for 1979-80 will be presented to the
UAS Board of Directors in January,
accordingto UAS General Manager
Robert E. Zahm.

UAS has been hit with increasesin
food prices in excess of ten per cent
and a minimum wage increase which
will raise the price of labor $80,000
on a half million dollar payroll, ac-
cording to Zahm.

Lowest Rates

The last board rate increase was
an eigth per cent hike four years ago.
According to Zahm. SUNYA‘S
board rates are currently the lowest
in the SUNY system. The charge for
the breakfast, 1 unch. and dinner plan
is $365 per semester

Last spring, the UAS board of

if approved by SUNYA President
()‘1crtry, these changes will be in
effect for the fall 1979 semester.

The defeated hill proposed that,
for students entering SUNYA in the
fall of 1979. a minimum of 36
graduation credits to be completed
at or above the 300 level. Presently.
there is no such requirement; only

Campus Planned Parenthood     by 
Clinic To Open Next Week

by Jill Haber

A new satellite clinic of Planned
Parenthood will open Sept. 2| atthe
SUNYA irtfirmary, according to
Albany Planned Parenthood
lixccutivc Director Ruth Klepper.

“The clinic will offer the same ser-
vices as the downtown Planned
Parenthood clinic on Lark  in-
cluding comprehensive birth control,
routine gynecological care, com-
ponents of counseling, pregnancy
testing. VD screening, and cancer
screening," said Klepper.The clinic
will be open on Thursday evening,
but Klepper said “We'll try to he as
flexible as p. ssible."

In the past, a birth control clinic
run by Albany Medical Center was
held at the infirmary. According to
Dean for Student Affairs Neil
Brown, the Medical Center Clinic
served 500 students, while 800
students had become patients of the
downtown Planned Parenthood
clinic.

lirown said that the Medical
Center ('lirtic was discontinued
when it government grant was not
awarded. Director of Stttdent
Health Services Janet flood
speculatch iliill one reason for its
leaving was that “limit was it big
furor l‘ttlSL‘Ll on the part of some
students. 1t1nrtk they[/\lbany Med.]
just thought it was time for a
change.“

flood relcred to the lorrtier clinic
as a "model clinic". but said she
thought Planned Parenthood could
do an equal job.

“There is an effort to have more
educational components - open it up
to boys and so forth,“ flood said.

“We‘ll be working with RA's and
developing programs for dorms -
general discussions about various

aspects of sexuality,“ said Klepper.

As part of the educational facet of
the program, a two—credit course in
human sexuality will be offered this
semester. according to Browu.

Klepper said site hopes to be able
to eventually establish informational
sessions on Friday afternoons, but
that the details haven't been worked
out yet.

Patient fees will be established on
a sliding scale; a first time visit for a
routine exam willcost $13.00 plus an
additional charge for a pap smear.
Students will have the opportunity
to open “charge accounts“ at the
clinic and to pay by installment,said
Klepper, somctlting which the
Albany Med. clinic could not offer
“because they did not have the
rncchartisrn for developing charge
accounts."

According to Klepper. the idea to
have Planned Parenthood fill the
void when Albany Med. moved out
was a mutual one. “Planned
Parenthood had been in touch with
the health service. We‘ve had many,
many students enrolled downtown,
and we keep irt touch with Albany
Med."

Site stressed that a primary benefit
of the new arrangement is that
students who are currently enrolled
at the downtown clinic may use
either the uptown or the downtown
facilities and vice versa.

A student liaison committee of 12
members will provide inputand help
with the education parts of the
progrrun, said Klepper. The group
will be composed of five students ap-
pointed by SA President Paul Feld-
man, four students from the down-
town clirtie, and representatives
from Planned Parenthood, Student

department.

The problem, according to Stu-
dent Senator DAvid Weintrattb, is
that, agter having taken all the
necessary prerequisites for 300 level
courses in more titan one depart-
ment (because many departments do
not offer 36 BOO-level credits)
students have little or no roorn for
electives.

Student Senator Hugh Hill
argued that before this bill is passed,
all SUNYA courses should be
numbered permanently and un-
iformly. 1n the English Dcpanment,
for example, Eng 43‘) Contem-
porary American Novel, was
previoust ling 238.

Directors unanimously passed a
$100,000 deﬁcit budget for the 1978-
79 year and avoided a board increase
for this year by dipping into cor-
porate reserves which had ac-
cumulated over the past fiscalyears.

However, prices in the Campus
Center cafeteria, the Patroon Room,
and Campus Center deli have been
raised fron five to ten percent and
certain items in the Rathskeller
snack bar ahve also experienced

price increases. lnaddition, washing ,

machine prices rthve increased from
30 cents to 35 cents.

Liability Insurance and
workman's compensation have
“doubled.“ said Zahm. “While
liability insurance isn‘t in the
sandwich, it‘s in the background."

“Zahm doesn't have the power to

inplement a board increase," said
1978-79 UAS Board of Directors
President Paul Feldman. “He can
only recommend one to the Board."

The UAS Board of Directors is
composed of ten students and ten
others who are elected from the
membership board. The
membership board is made up of
three administrators, eight faculty,
21 students, and one alumnus.

Students on Board

The studentslon the membership
board are appointed by the SA
President. The 1978-79 board will be
selected in twm to three weeks, ac-
cording to SA President Paul Feld-
than. Although he was President of
the UAS Board of Directors last
year. l-‘eidman said he will not serve
on UAS this year.

Mohawk Offices Move

by Marie (Toriissoz

The seven remaining office floors
lll Mohawk Tower will be ready for
\lUdL’lll occupation by the fall of
1979, according to Director of
Residences John Welly.

The renovation of the office floors
is designed to case sortie of the hous-
ing crunch on campus. Welty,
however. was not sure how much of
the housing problem will be solved
by the renovation.

Cost of Move

lhc estimated cost of the renova-
tiort will be $3,000 per floor, accor-
ding to Associate for University
l‘inrrncc Dennis Stevens. The pro-
jected $21,000 will come out of the
campus alteration funds. This figure
is what it cost this past summer to
remodel floors ‘) through 14 in
Mohawk Tower, said Stevens. who
added that he sees no reason wlty the
cost wottld change.

However. Assistant Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Stierer said that “rt'o err-
timates have been prepared yet.“

Sliercr said that work orders for the
renovation will be drawn up next
spring and that work on the rooms
will start at the close of the spring
semester and should be finished by
the end of the summer.

l‘lot)rs 15 through 2| are now oc-
ctrpied by the schools of Social
Welfare and Criminal Justice. These
schools will be moved downtoth
during iltc summer. Tire renovation
of the downtown campus is being
funded primarily by the State.
S UNYA funds totalling $150,000 are
being used to renovate housing for
those two schools and the School of
Library Science.

Campus Too Small

Although Dean of Social Welfare,
Seth Spellrnttn has "mixed feelings"
about the move, ltc sttid that he does
not see any serious problems.

“I am living with the reality that
the campus is not big enough for all
of us", said Spellmttn. "As long as
the school is adequately supported
by library systems and other
educational sulports, i do not think

designation may be applied toward
the degree requirements," and for
those seckinh a BA degree, that “a
maximum of 60 graduation credits
with a single subjectdcsignation may
be applied toward the degree rc-
quircnrents.

One encourages speciﬁcation
while tlte other discourages it,“ he
strid.

Downtown

there will be arty detrimental
effects.“

Criminal Justice Dean, Donald
Newman, terms the move
'mrtrvclous."

The Graduate School of Public
Affairs has recently moved from the
main" Tower tounderneath the
library. Assistant to the
Dean. Thornth Kelly. said "the move
was done with it minimal
disruption." He felt their new
location was “the best we‘ve ever
had.
