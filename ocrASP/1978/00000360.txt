New Planned Parenthood Clinic Opens Next Week

continued from page one
Affairs.andthe SUNYA Health Ser-
vice. according to Klepper.

Late last spring. a proposal for a
human sexuality center was sub-
mitted by five women students. The
report found the Albany Med. clinic
"unsuitable due to its off-campus
base and lack of student participa-
tion in all areas of clinic func-
tioning."

The proposal called for an in-
terrelated counseling clinic. a healtit
clinic with'ofiice hours four times a
week fori’twd hours a session.-and a
three credit 'eour'se covering
anatomy. the reproductive systems.
contraceptives. and the running ofa
clinic. Brown called the proposal
“well done."

Hood claimed the report “con-
tained many unkind comments from
people who don't know the
[ALBANY Med.] clinic." She said‘
“The proposaluw stripnge. 
wanted free service and they wante
the student body tti foot the bill for

‘ it.“ 'I‘tteyproposalistates‘that the uni?
iversity should be responsible for

providing the $227 I0 the committee
felt would pay for the operation of
tlte center.

Kleppei termed the proposal \“a
very heavy document to throw at a
university in terms of cost. The
proposal which was presented was
really an $80,000 proposal. including
everything from the cost of malprac-i
ticc insurance to finding a physician.
But the concerns are very valid.“ She
cited sensitivity to students and a
more integrated approach to sexual
needs as some of the points stressed
in the proposal. ;

Student Patrol Proposmd

by Jill Sussmnn
and Dave. Benson

For the second time. the academic
year has begun without the reinstate-
ment of the Student Patrol because
of funding problems. according to
SA Vice President Fred Brewington.

Two years ago, the Student
Security Patrol was begun as a group
of students. who after going through
screening tests Were trained by the
SUNYA Police Department and
placed on patrol. 'I‘heirjobs included
escorting students home late at night
and keeping their eyes open for van-
dals. They worked in groups oftwo,
using walkie-talkies. and frequently
reporting back to their director.

This year the administration is
looking into giving students credit to

Former SAVicc President Kathy
Baron. who was a major contributor
to the proposal. said that the only
major difference between the com—
mittee‘s proposal and the current set
tip is that medical care is being
provided by an outside agency. "I
would rather that it [medical care]
SUNY Albany funded. but untilthat
cart be worked out this was the best
alternative." Baron had met with
Brown over the summer to discuss
the proposal. "Everything else is go-
ing as scheduled. although the
counseling program will taketime."

I.

work on the Student Security Patrol
iitstcitd of paying them. as in the
past. according to Brewington. lfthc
plan is approved, he said. the credtt
will most likely come from the
Criminal Justice Department. Ac-
cording to llrcwington. it will take at
least two montlts to get a proposal
together.

However. Dean of the School of
Criminal Justice Donald Newman
said that while he has heard nothing
yet of tlte proposal. credit would
probably not be granted because

Criminal Justice is a graduati-
program and the Student Patrol in:
voives undergraduates.

Director of University Police Jim
Williams said he was in favor ol
reinstating the patrol, but agreed
that there was a problem ofiunding.

r He said he could not see any cor-
relation betwoen the changing rate oi
crime on and around the‘campusand
the patrol when it was inservice. Ac.
cording to Williams, the crime rates
fluctuated when they had the patrol
and continue to do so now.

Torch Yearbook Still Unlit

lllllllllllt’rf from page I/ll’l’t‘
attending SUNYA for yet another
week. According to Tcrilli. this time
is needed to organize. “so that we
don‘t have It mass of confusion
desccttding upon the office."

Ihe Class oi '78 and those who
tt'ttnslerred or withdrew from
SUNYA in May will receive the
books by mail. directly from the
printers. According to 'l'crilli. the
approximately 500 books remaining
will go on stile in the Campus Center.

“It was a big disappointment."
said (iold. “If I was a senior. I would
have liked to get the yearbook when
I graduated. After all this time. I
wouldn't even be thinking of
SUNYA anymore. Four months
later. it‘s kind of anticlimactic. I
hadn‘t even thought about what
would happen if there Were a mail

#

strike.“ he said.

The I978 Torch is the first to be
mailed to graduates in the fall. rather
than being distributed on campusin
the spring. According to 'l'criili. the
changes were prompted by two luc-
tors: moneyland quality.

"It was a conscious decision." said
I‘erilli. “We thought it would ini-
provc the book. When yoti hau- a
deadline in October. you shoot those
pictures in September. It they don‘t
come otit too well that‘s tough. You
don't have the time to reshoot Illtlor
200 pictures. Wltcn I say qualitycon-
trol, I mean photographic quality
control.“ he said. “It was based oii
this that I proposed to my stall that
we consider switching to fall publicit-
tiott. The financial problems were

'one consideration. bill they were
very secondary."

Candidates Enter Final Hours

NEW YORK (AP) With Lt. Gov.
Mary Anne LKrupsak stepping up
her tough verbaljabs at Gov. Hugh
Carey. the two enter their final fran-
tic hours of campaigning for the"
Democratic gubernatorial nomina-

'tion.

In the next-to-Iast debate among
the Democratic candidates for
governor on Sunday. Miss Krupsak
blamed Carey for rent increases and
utility rate hikes. accused ltim of
catering to special interests and
predicted he will “go to sleep" if rc-

elected.

And in the debate and later in the
day during her campaigning. she
depicted herself as a friend of “the
people" who would “not be afraid to
take on Con Ed“ and would keep in
touch with “the serious issues that
affect people in their daily lives."

Carey responded byciting what he
described as his record of cutting
taxes. strengthening -the state‘s
economy and saving New York City
and the state itself from financial
collapse

Miss Krupsak‘s attack was
seconded by state Sen. Jeremiah
Bloom of Brooklyn. the third (tan-
didate seeking the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination itt
luesday‘s election.

Bloom said that Carey had been
"inattentive" and had shown "no
crealiiity" And the little-known
state senator reiterated his support
tor the death penalty. which he.
alone among the Democratic can—
didates. supports.

Both Miss Krupsak and Bloom
time made Carey's personality.
it Iiich they describe as aloof.a major
issue tll their campaign to unseat the
man who ended I6 years of
Republican rtile with his victory in
I‘l74.

Bloom. however. is given little
chance in the primary. and the con-
test is generally rcgarded as between
Miss Krupsak and Carey. And inlhc

debate Sunday. as well as in their
final campaign schedules. the gover-
nor and lieutenant governor directed
most of their competitive energies
against each other.

Immediately after the debate.
Miss Krupsak plunged into the crush
of people and vendors at the Third
Avenue Merchants Association
"County Fair." And to herald her
presence as site walked along the
crowded street. she had a sort of
street band formed by Chinese-
Americans.

But Carey made his own pitch tor
lllt.‘ Chinese-American \ote h_\ atten-
ding a rally in Chinatown. and “If
his walk down crowded Mott Street.
he had a well-trained school band.

“\ oti are a good-looking people.
We liish don‘t ha\e looks. We try to
get h_\ on our brains." he quipped at
a meeting ol L‘hinatonn of-

Candidate Visits Campus
Michael Roth. the Republican candidatelor New York State At-
torney General. made a brief stop at SUNYA last Thursday as
part at his upstate campaign swing. Roth, on a scale from 1 to
100 with the former being ultra conservative and the latter ultra
liberal. considers himself a 62. Favoring the death penalty, Roth
also said he tell he could easily work with the pot deerlmlnallza-
lion law though he himsett does not lavorlegallzatlon. Praising
current Attorney General Louie Letkowttz for his role as "chlel
consumer advocate ot the people at the state," Roth pledged to
continue the civil court activism ot Lelkowltz while working to
enhance the processing at criminal cases. Roth laces tough
competitiontn November trom either at the two Democratic
