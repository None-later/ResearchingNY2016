Review

Former Byrds Turn Turn Turn

By M. J. MEMMOTT

irst off, you must understand

that I'm a Byrds fan from way

back; so take whatever I say in

this critique with a grain of

salt. But the show that three
former Byrds, Roger (or Jim) McGuinn,
Gene Clark, and Chris Hillman put on
Sunday night at the Madison Theater was
excellent.

Before discussing their show however,
let me get through a little unpleasant
business. There was a warm-up group
whose name was the Ravellcrs. The name,
appropriately for them, rhymes with
travellers since that is what they will be
doing. 'l'lre'Ravellcrs will be travellingthc
quick and rocky road to oblivion. Suffice
it to say that they‘re a bad imitation of a
few different I9frll‘s English bands. Now
on to the more important stuff.

As most of you remember, the Byrds
were that group from the 60's who scored
big with songs like Mr. Tambourine Man,
Turn, Turn. Turn, and Eight Miles High
The members included MeGuinn, Clark
and Hillman, along with adrummer Mike
Clark (who‘s no relation to Gene) and a
guitarist David Crosby

It was the old standards that got the
near sell-out crowd moving. of course.
Everything was there: McGuinn‘s
jangling I2-string guitar. Clark's smooth
voice. and Hillman‘s singing and steady
bass playing. Eyen Greg Thomas, the
drummer McGunn first recruited for his
lhunderbyrd album, fit right in with his
typically Byrdish urrdcrlying-but-firm
hear. llut as always. it wasthe tight vocals
that stood out.

Among the old hits, they played
('Irr'rrrex of l-‘reez/unr. I'IIFt'e/a Whole Lot

Better, and Mr. Tambourine Man from
their first hit album, one that was released
back when they still made them in mono.
Considering the reception the audience
gave those songs and others like Mr.
Space/nan andSo You Wanna bea Rock

rand Roll Star. it was easy to see I wasn‘t
'the only Byrds freak in Albany. It was

almost like being there during those
legendary days when Bob Dylan sang
songs that meant something. and the
Byrds were his favorite band to surprise
on stage. '
The only major differences, of course,
were the absences ofCrosby and the other
Clark. and the fact that McGuinn was
now occupying center stage instead of his
old Byrds style of appearing as a grinning
devil at the side ol‘the group. However. it
is only right that he take the central
position. Although Hillman may betlre

Bock-The Clock

more accomplished musician (his
mandolin playing during Pretty Boy
Floyd and YouAin’t Going Nowhere was

' a highlight of the concert) and Clark may

have a more pleasant voice, it is
McGuinn‘s unique guitar playing and
singing which has made the Byrds what
they are.

He proved it during an excellent
rendition of Chestnut More and a short
but sweet Eiqu Miles High. The latter
came during the ﬁrst of two encores and
contained the best guitar playing
McGuinn showed all night. '

I got the feeling that most ofthc people
leaving the Madison Sunday night felt
much the way I did. That is. that whilethe
new stuff MeUuinn, Clark and Hillman
did sounded good. it‘s always going to be
the old hits that people will want to hear
most.
