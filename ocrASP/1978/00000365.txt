GUIDANCE FOR THE PERPLEXED

If you are interested in studying sociology, chances are you 'may be
slightly perplexed. It is common for students to have afuzzy idea, at
best of all the fields encompassed by socmlogy, and how they fit into

ne's particular interests. - I I '

n 50 if you 'are a new sociology major, or are thinking of majoring (or
minoring) in sociology, or are interested in how socrology relates to your
own field, whatever it is (art, education, science —— you name it, it
relates) then this meeting is for you! . '

Professor Arnold Foster (the fellow with the long: white beard) will
describe the Department’s courses andfaculty. He will do his darnedest
to answer your questions, and generally dispel your doubt and
confusion.

Wednesday, September 13
