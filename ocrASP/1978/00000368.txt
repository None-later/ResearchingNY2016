Cross Country Squad: A Mixture. Of Talent

Comblnlng the young and the experlencad. the Albany cross country

 

squad has the Ingredients for success (Photo: Bob Leonard).

by David Osborn

Albany State cross country coach
Bob Munsey. with the edge of his
silvery beard slightly moist fromsip-
ping coffee, sat in his office on a lazy
Wednesday afternoon last week dis-
cussing the fate of his squad for the
‘78 season. A baby-faced runner then
strode into the room. 

“People like this fine looking
young fellow will have a lot to do
with our success this season."
Munsey said. “If Scotty here and
some of his other freshmen buddies
can come through for us in the
season like they‘ve shown in prac-
tice. we‘ll have a fine '01 year."

the Danes will representa team com-

that included a l3-2 mark and the

l’lantier.

“The more games we play the better

on Jiily.l977. set forth a plan for the
future and direction for SUNYA

“The Mission Statement was a

“Now comes the actual implementa-
tion of what it stated."O'Leary add-
ed that the new document will up—

date the Mission Statement.

In. a speech to faculty last week.
O‘Leary talked about the new docu-
ment and the focus of this institu-
tion.

The quality of tenchihg was one of
the topics covered at the meeting. as
well as in the document.

"We have to address it. “said
O‘Leary. "The University as a whole
has not looked at thisthere is a need
to do better in this area." O‘Leary
added that he will enlist the involve~
ment of the faculty in setting
guidelines for teacbiiig quality.

SA President Paul Feldman said
that he felt the teaching guidelines
were a “good sign.“

“()he of the things we have
thought of coming up with is
“’l‘eachcr ofthe Year“ and “Advisor of
the Y -ar‘ award.“ Feldman added.

In the Mission Statement. an
agenda of action was made in the
form of three-year plans for
SUNYA's divisions. offices and
departments. This year. all of the

TAP Processing Improved Since Last Year

by Debby Smith

liighty-live percent ofthe l978-79
luition Assistance Program
applications have been processed as
of Sept. l. exceeding the processing
performance of any year since the
TAP program was created in 1974.
according to the Higher Education
Services Corporation I

intensive field efforts to acquaint
students and advisors with a new
application format. a complete
redesign of the manual and com-
puter processing systems. and the ac-
quisition ofacomputcifor exclusive
use by H ESC. were major changes in
the processing system.

One of the reasons for the im-
provement iii the TAP-Scholarship
processing was the redesigning ofthe

student payment application. which
has larger type. and more explicit
directions than the I977-78 applica—
tion.

l-llESC Executive Assistant to the
President John Moore said that
possibly the biggest problem of last
year‘s processing was that forty per-
cent of the applications had errors.

“[That] required as to go back to
the applicants for the missing or in—
correct information,"said HESC
Vice President for Research Michael
Cruskic.

“i haven‘t had any tremendous
problems with the corporation this
year as compared to last year." said
Bursar Robert DcVoe.

Another reason for the improve-
ment is that HESC "distributed

public policy and the using of cam-
pus recources to meet the needs ofr
the community at large. The new
document reaffirms this direction.
stating that “.,..lhe University ex—
pects to accelerate its participatidn
iii public policy research and service
with the goal of providing accurate
information and reliable analysis for
decision makers"

in the introduction of the docuv
ment. O‘lcary wrote: "Our respon-
sibility for the betterment of the
larger community through policy
studies shall contine to be a guiding
assumption in our planning ac-
tivities."

Ihe community. in turn. might be
a prime source for obtaining
resource funds. according to the
doeuriicrit.

"lt[the University] tiiust accelerate
efforts to increase financial con-
tributions to the University from
private and non—state sources..."the
document stated.

"Not all of these goals may be
realized within the year." said
()‘lcary. “But the point is that we
\vill begin the process and attempt
iimplementation,"

U‘l.eary said that a document of
‘liis kind will be released on a yearly
basis

SUNYA Budget Hearing Slated

by (‘barles Bell

SUNYA‘s $50 million budget for.

the l979-80 fiscal year will soon be
evaluated by the State Division of
the Budget. SUNYA Budget Officer
llarold Brink said that the budget re-
quest has been sent to the DOB.
which will be holding hearings in oc-
tobcr with SUNY and SUNYA of-
ficials.

l he 550.798.600
represents an increase of $3 million
met the current operating budget.
according to Brink. lhe increases
are broken dowti into five categories.
three of which-salary tid—
) tistmcnts.price increases and
cqtiipiiiiciit i'cplaceiiieiit-are con-
sidered “fixed costs".

who applied by mid summer."said
lllzsC President Eileen Dickinson.

Out of a 'l’Al’ budget of $224
million. awards valuing $l9‘) million
have been granted to more than 270.-
000 students for Regents
Scholarships and TAP awards. Nine
percent of the applications received
were incomplete, and six percent
were recently received and are being
prepared for processing. according
to Moore.

The Miller/Kremer legislation.
which Governor Carey proposed
retroactively last fall. was enacted in

’aul Vcillcttc said that. "liach year.
certain increases in the httdgct are
\irittally mandatory.“ He cited as an
example the need to approve salary
increase money in oidci to honor a
contractual obligation with a union.
"However. if a campus wants to
stait a new program. it may not be
apprmcd. "said Vcillcttc. "()iin in ii

lliiiik says he coiisideis tltc sum

to be the most signilicaiit part of the
new budget. He said that these iii-

SI lNYA's budget ahead of ittllatioii.

pi ove adequate fixed cost increases.
llriiik said. “All departments and of-
fices would have to absorb the loss.
\\lllL‘ll would mean that cutbacks
would probably have to be made.“
According to Brink. the budget is
so far the product of twelve months
work between SUNYA and the

Marclt of [97%, resulting in the in-
crease of TAP awards for students
attending private colleges from
S [500 to $l800. according to
L‘ruskie.

“Students who were awarded'l'AP
is l977-7li are to receive a supple-
ment check for the increase. in fact.
we‘re still sending it. We send the
payments after. the school certiﬁes
that the student attended."Cruskie
said.

The income below which the max--
imum TAP award is granted was
raised from $2000 to $2750;The
minimum award for an un-
dergraduate dependent on parents,
with an income below $20,000 was
raised front 5 lth t0 $200. according
to Dickinson.

SlJNY central administration.
When the budget appears next
January as part of the Executive
ltiidgct. “It will include all the major
changes worked out by the DOB.“

A SUNY spokesperson said that
"during the last twelve months. the
central administration has worked
\\ itli all the SU NY campuses tocoor-
tfiiiiitc all their requests into an
mci‘all SIJNY budget.“

()iii‘ considerations are based on
need and merit, “said the spokesper-
son and he explained that program
iiiiproteiiieiit money is "targeted"to
ihc \ai‘iotis SUNY campuses depen-
tliiig on a projected "siic ” of the
piogt'aiii in that location. The
budget is then reviewed by the DOB
and the legislative fiscal committees
before becoming part of the
lzxectitive Budget.

Vcillcttc said that the DOI-ljudges
the requests “according to financial
considerations dictated by the State.
We read. analyre. and make

for his January budget.“

Veillette said that SUNYA‘s
budget requests will be given a
