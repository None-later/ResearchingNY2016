Agony 0f 'Déiééii‘dr Krupsak .,

/

by Mitchell Dneh

At 8:00 pm last Tuesday night it
was quiet in the Albany Krupsak for
Governor headquarters. No mul-
titude of phones were constantly
ringing. The eight or ten campaign
workers were not bustling around.
collecting and recording important

data. No one was even drinking the
beer yet. Everyone was waiting.

Outside. the youngest campaign
workers (a pair of politically
hyperactive twelve year olds) were
decisively defeating several
neighborhood kids at a game of
“chase away the little pests". Their
victory was the only victory of the
evening for the Krupsak workers.

Returns began coming in at 8:30.
They were dismal. By 9:30 the
traditional suspense ofelection night
was over. The early returns indicated
that Carey would win the primary by
many votes and they were not prov-
ed wrong. Governor Carey garnered
52% ofthe vote, Lt. Governor Krup-
sak collected 34% and State Senator
Bloom collected l4%.

Krupsak ﬁrst became a candidate
for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination with a suddenness that
shocked N.Y. State. As late as the
beginning of last June. she was plan-
ning to run for Lt. Governor on
Hugh Carey's ticket. On the Ilth of
June she declared that Carey was
aloof. inaccessable and that he did
not put enough effort into being
governor. She then announced that
she would not run for Lt. Governor
on his ticket.

Two weeks later. barely ten Weeks
before primary day. she announced
her candidacy for the governorship.

 

 

tion, she was popular among both
upstate democrats and New York
City liberals. She also had the asset of
being well known throughout the
state.

However, Krupsak also faced
many disadvantages. The
organizational problems her cam-
paign faced were enormous. Within
days. she had to put together a cam-
paign staff. Money had to be raised,
speaking tours had to be arranged.
Campaign workers had to be
recruited 'and leaﬂets had to be
written and printed.

As a result of being hastily put
together. the campaign was highly
disorganized and poorly run. Com-
munication problems constantly
hindered the campaign. accordingto
Albany County Krupsak coor—
dinator. 'l‘om Scarf. “There was
never any downstate-upstate coor-
dination at all“. said Scarf. “We
never knew where Mary Anne was.“
And on the rare occasions when they
did know where Krupsak was. said
Scarf. they couldn't find out what
her stand on many issues was
because she never issued policy
statements. As a result of this some
campaign leaflets. such as the
Albany leaflets about the elderly.
were written with more of the
writer‘s opinions then Krupsak's.

Perhaps the major problem of
Krupsak's campaign was its lack of
funds. While the Carey forces spent
upwards of $I.5 million. Krupsak
had a campaign budget ofjust Sl25.-
000. Ironically. in 1974 Carey had
campaigned for public financing of
elections because of the inequities of
private financing.

Krupsak was unable to afford
television'ads in any of upstate N.Y.
l'he sole extent of her media blitz
were a few last minute television

well organized campaign and he had
the automatic advantage ofbeingthe ‘
incumbent. Added to this. he had the
support of the regular Democratic
Party organizations throughout the
state. With a little help from Mayor
Corning. Carey got twice as many
votes as Krupsak in Albany County.

Back at Krupsak campaign head-
quarters people drank beer. tried to
explain the defeat and then wont
home to watch the “:00 o'clock
news on cable. A dozen people.
myself included. ended the evening
with drinks at the Dewitt Clinton
Hoth headquarters.

People who worked for the city or
state joked half seriously about the

Victory" At Carey Headquarters _

by Steve Outer

It sounded like a winner‘s locker
room. A general buzzing punctuated
occasionaliy~ by a crescendo of
laughter. There were backs to be
slapped and hands to be shook. And
there was some good Irish drinking
to keep it alive.

M

Yet Governor Carey‘s Campaign
Headquarters at the Hibernian HII
on Quail Street looked nothing like a
locker rooin last 'I’ucsday night.
Rather. the dimly lit. smoke-filled
bar room was packed tight with the
governor's contingent of canvasscrs.

possibility of losing their jobs. As
time went by. the evening dissolved
into the little of alcohol and bad
jokes. I'his reporter had the dubious
distinction of wintiitig the two-
quarts-for-tt-dollar cltcap whiskey
award for doing the most drinking
and gettingth most drunk. Krupsak
workers couldn't seem to win at
anything last I’uesday night.

 

 

Correction

It was incorrectly reported in last
Friday‘s ASI’ that the Student
Credit Union will be offering five
and one-half percent interest on
deposits. The correct figure is five
and one-quarter percent.

had been victorious. and by an ap-
preciable margin. All that remained
to be seen was how the individual
wards had fared. and each successive
announcement sent another beam-
ing ward manager up to the bar with
mug in hand. .

What in the early evening had
been a guarded optimism had by
now balooned into a list-clenching
high which swept the entire room.
Mary Anne Krupsak. the renegade
1.1. Governor who had fled the Carey
ranks last June to challenge the
governor. Iiud been defeated.

Now the talk turned to
Republican gubernatorial hopeful
I’crry Duryca.

"We‘re ready for the Silver Fox. as
we CilII him." said campaign worker
l'ony Saturno. fingering his Carey
button and looking up from a swirl-
ing beer head.

"'l‘he primary returns show that
we've got‘a broad base of support
around the state." Scott continued.
"and we feel that Gov. Carey's

What about the death penalty?

trying to pick out the influencials
from the mass. Presently. my two
drinking companions returned. es-
corting a plump. grey-haired woman
to our table. I am introduced to a
smiling Mrs. Kay iii 'gerald. Deputy
Director for the Carey upstate cam-
paigii. She. too. is looking ahead to

"I can‘t help btit feel that ifwe take
the primary by ten or twelve percent
tagc points." she explained. “then
he‘ll be able to take the election as

the vote. Krupsak only 34. for and

Why such optimism?

"I‘ve talked with upstate
Republicans." she said. “and many
aren't happy with Duryco as their
candidate. Many of them weren't
even very familiar with him."

She explained that Carey. in his
first term as executive. was con—
tinuaily Iiindcrcd by financial

- deficits and an unweildy civil service.

"liack iii the days when the money
grew on trees. a vast amount ofovcr-
budgeting took place we were forced
to deal with the problem ofmillions
ol dollars in moral obligations the
last administration itmtnasscd. 'l‘o

make matters infinitely worse.
Rockefeller. in his lb years in the
capital. froze so many civil service
employees into their jobs that it was
extremely difficult and time-
consuming to make any significant
cuts." she explained.

"I sincerely hope that. in his next
term. the governor is able to make
more politically visible decisions it
would ccrtainlly make my job
easier."

Hui what of SUN YA's futtirc dur-
ing those next four years? Did they
promise to be as tumultuous and
damaging as the past four"! Will the
scars of retrenchment. l’hl) siashings
arid htidgct cuts be healed? If Carey
docs remain iii office. can SUNYA
cotmt on the executive for moral
and. more important. financialaid'.’
“I would say that the governor is
committed to the future ol'Albany as
it vital universityceiitcr.SUNY/\ isa

better..."

She continued. and gradually the
rhetoric seemed to become as thick
and bothersome as the veil ofsmokc
which Itung over the room. She ex-
plained that Carey had “not even
been awarc" of the problctns over at
SUNYA until she herself had iii-
lornicd film of them. and that “the
worst was over."

Not long after she‘d excused
herself and I'd run out of things to
say to Suturiio and Scott, lbcgan to
feel markedly uncotnfortablc amid
the celebration. I just couldn't un-

1 derstand Carey “having no idea“ of
what was going on in one of his
state's university centers. especially
the one located in his Cilpilﬂl‘
Assurcnces as to the worst being
over provided little sticcor against
such thoughts.

Finally. I dismissed such depress—
ing thoughts to a beer induced
niclancliolia. Still. as I stood up to
Ictnc. I couldn‘t help but feel like an
zilsii-raii in II winners‘ locker room.
