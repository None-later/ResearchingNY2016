NASAL SEX PREP

Researchers at Uppsala Universi-
ty Hospital in Sweden claim they
have developed a new birth control
substnace that can be used by either
women or men. .t.

Doctor Sven Johan Nillius says
the new contraceptive is inhaled
through the nose. Doctor Nillitis
states that the substance directly
affects a hormone secreted by the
brain. which in turn, inhibits egg
production in women and sperm
production in men.

According to the Swedish doctors.
if large-settle clinical tests on both
sexes prove positive. the new female-
malc birth control nasal spray
should be on the market within a few
years time. ,

. RED WEED

A top law enforcement officer in
Mexico is cautionng American pot-
sinokers to be leery of red-splotched

marijuana.

Deputy Attorney General Fernan—
do Bacza says that red-colored dyes
are being mixed with the weed-
killing agent paraquat, and that the
chemical is being used with limited
success on pot fields south of the
border.

, According to Baeza, “The leaves
come out full of red spots. like they
have been splashed with red ink. We
are still hopingto getthc whole plant
to turn bright red."

Baeza even adds some tips for
smokers who are worried about ae-
cidentally toking up on con-

ltaminated weed: “Even if the joint
does not look bright red to start
with. it will under discotheque lights.
And if you smoke enough of it. your
lips will look the same."

LOVE A POLE

Lovemaking in Poland is better
than it is in the West.

At least this is the opinion of a
Professor of Social Sexology.
lrcnisz Kamelinski, who happens to
be polish.

Kamelinski says be surveyed l0.-
(l00 Poles aged 18 to 65 on the sub-
ject of sex. then fed the results into a
computer and compared them with
what he knows of the Western
World.

Kamelinski says he found that the
kiss is very big in Poland, and that
Poles spend much more time kissing
than people in the West. He says that
a kiss is Poland is not merely an
erotic excitant. but is an expression
of tenderness. and a more important
symbol of intimacy than sex itself.

[be Professor claims this is
because Poles have not been affected
by pornography. llis survey showed
that 93 percent of the women and 86
percent of the men rejected por-

ZQAGMEWS 

nography on the grounds that it
dchumanized the sexualexperience.

And. last. but not least,
Kamelinski says that another con-
clusion of the lovemaking survey
was that most Polish women and
men agree that making love between
l l and [2 in the morning is the most
enjoyable time.

STUCK UP

You might say that the late Keith
Moon, the unpredictable drummer
ol the Who, got himself into a very
sticky situation in Los Angclcs this
summer.

According to the British publica-
tion. Melody Maker. it all started
after Moon discovered “super glue,"
the super-sticking cement often
advertised on late-night TV.

Moon. ‘with superglue in hand.
allegedly went around his Los
Angelcs hotel. gluing the luggage of

many unsuspecting tourists to the

into somelrooms, turned up the TV
sets to full volume. and then applied
a liberal dose of the glue to the
volume control knob.

. DOGMATIC GUY

If your budget is tight. why not
live the life of a dog?

'l‘hat‘s exactly what a London
journalist did for one week. sub-
sisting on canned dog food and dog
biscuits without suffering any
nutritional problems.

For $6.90 a week, Angus King liv-
ed entirely on doggic snack, receiv-
ing an intake of about 400 calories
per meal,40 gramsof protein,and an
idequate supply of calcium,
vitamins and minerals. King says he
based his nutritional intake on that
recointncndcd for “people food”
caters.

llis menu included such delicaci s
as "choice cuts" stroganoff, “minced
morsels" stuffed pancakes"
“superkenomeat” bolognaise and
“pedigree chum" cooked in red wine.

King insists he feels fine after his
week on doggie chow. although he
admits he developed a profound dis-

“.llkc tor the stuff.
