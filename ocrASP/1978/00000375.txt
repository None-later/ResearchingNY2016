ost bar bands have their high
points, their good songs or
their good sets, or do one
particular style well. Your
Move, who played last Friday
night at Bogart‘s play well from start to
finish and show great versatility; they do
everything well and at a par equal to that
ofsome ofthe best recording acts. This is
primarily because they demonstrate an
understanding and sensitivity to the
fundamentals of rock and roll. They mix
well. keep their instruments under
control. but are, like all great rock acts,
just on the verge of being out ofcontrol.

Guitarist Bob Killar's leads are smooth
yet ccsiaiic.;His rhythm guitar supports the
band with sharp precise chops that build
excitement under the surface particularly
on The Who‘s “Won‘t Get Fooled
Again", which they dedicated to the late
Keith Moon. This band could rock even if
you unpltigged their amps and gave them
acoustic instruments. The key is their
timing, mixing and sensitivity to their
instruments. Despite the fact that they
played without a second lead guitar, or
echo they managed to get one of their
most enthusiastic responses from the
audience when they performed Boston's
“Long Time." The group deservesgreat
praise for being able to pull this song off
without the special effects.

Your Move‘s backup vocals are strong,
in tune and well mixed. They are done
especially well on Bowie‘s “Changes” and

Steely Dan‘s "Peg" on which the
harmonies are superbly effected. All four
members of the band sing lead except
Harvey ,Kojan. the keyboardist and
spokesman for the group. who limits
himself to backups. .

But Your Move is not really a bar band,
In fact their original material is the most
interesting and important aspect of the
group. Since no one is really open to new
material, the band has been forced to do
the bar circuit and non-originals.
Determined as they are however. they
sneak a few originals in and now, after
developing a following and respect in the
Albany area. they have attempted to do a
full set of originals. The set is a string of
related songs called “Oblio and the Pig
l’ycoon: A Rock Fairy Tale."

 

 

 our‘MoVo:
ﬂlbonu's Best

"Oblio" is an original concept written
and performed by Your Move. Basically,
it is the story ofa boy from the future who
is sent back in time to alter the course of
history, and ultimately save the world
from a horrible late; the mechanization of
the human race. It’s sort of a stale
commentary but it‘s enjoyable and
charming none the less.

The fairy tale opens with an
introductory ballad in which Killar sings
of Oblio‘s plight. The group immediately
demonstrates a ﬂair for theatrical
performance in the opening number. The
song is played solo by Killar who sings
and plays the guitar with great feeling.
The effect is that an intimacy with Oblio is
personified by Killar is developed and
lonc‘s sympathy for Oblio is aroused. It‘s a
little contrived but is still well done.

After the introductory song the band
comes out roaring with two consecutive
long and elaborate rock songs. Here they
demonstrate sophistication in writing and
arranging. Everyone plays well together
and there is some great drumming by
John Emmet.

A couple of good change of pace songs
like “The Joker“ renew interest; they are
tactfully placed throughout the set
offering relief from the steady hard rock
beat. “The Joker“ is slower, but is still
quick and is sung with coolconfidence by
IKato Walker. The song is very
reminiscent of the “Magical Mystery

'Tour" which. in fact, the band had played
lin an‘earlier set,. -v v .

On the whole, "Oblio" seems to hav
been inspired by “Tommy”. The group
shows great ability but little creativity.
The structure is too similar to “Tommy”
and “Quadrophenia”. The style of their
songs is too easily compared to Al

Stewart, (particularly the introduction),
Bowie and The Who. The group
demonstrates great sensitivity and
intelligence for dynamics, but not in any
' genuinely creative way.They failto sustain
a long, interesting intensrty despite their
flair. This is primarily because the songs
lack any understanding melodic
motivation. harmony or chord
progression. In short, there is no hit
potential. The change of pace material
could be more appreciated ifthis were not
the case. However, “Oblio”

demonstrates great sensitivity to form.

t has been ten years since Jon
Anderson and Chris 'Squire
teamed up to form the
rudiments of a group which
has become one of the most
owerful forces in contemporary rock
_ i d roll...Yes. The present tour of the
‘tates" not only confirms their eminence
ut cntrcnches it morevdeeply. The group
asjusi completed a four night stand at
adison Square Garden. Each
crformance was sold out for a very good
ason. ch offers a universalappeal that
asn't waned the slightest during their
rsi decade of existence.

rlc Salzingor

The "Garden" concerts were peculiar in
i any ways as compared to the group‘s
. appearances prior to New York, yet often
he show seemed curiously predictable,
Conspicuously, the tickets requested
seating promptly at 8:00. The concert
. didn‘t begin until a few minutes after
' when the traditional Firebird Suite
echoed through the air followed by the
, entrance of the group onto the circular
., center stage.
Yes is comprised of five members. Jon
Anderson is the lead vocalist who
4. ' provides much of the group‘s inspiration
v as ,well as an extra guitar and an
occasional background percussion. He
was acknowledged as the leader of the
group on stage as be mounted the raised
platform at the stage‘s center. Anderson is
ﬂanked on either side by the two
; guitarists. To his right is Steve Howe who
f. I impeccably plays most of the lead guitar
j parts and is responsible for the majority
Lof the Yes scores. Chris Squire on bass
:guitar stands to his left. Squire also has a
hand in the writing of much of Yes‘s
material and in most cases at least creates
the bass line.
Y The remaining two band members are
 Rick Wakeman on keyboards and Alan
White on drums. Each incorporates his
own special style into the group‘s
_ Icemplex musical arrangements, though
1neither is intrinsic to the Yes group.
Wakenian had left the band for three
years to pursue his personal career. He
returned to the studio with them in l977
to record Goingfor the One. Alan White
on the other hand has remained with the
group since joining in I972 and had
provided a driving beat for them as a
premier rock drummer. As a group these
five men complement beautifully and I
" saw the result last Friday night.
They opened with “Siberian Khatru “
as the stage started to revolve cautiously

clockwise, and led directly into “Heart of
the Sunrise." (a la Yessongs vol. l,side l).
lhcsc selections clearly established a
familiarity with the group enabling them
to introduce a few cuts offiheir upcoming
album. Tommy).

New Songs Featured

The first selection we heard was
"Future ,Timcs". a pulsing rocker
featuring Howe and Anderson
exchanging the spotlight throughout. lt
convinced the audience of the group's
commitment to rock and roll. especially
the hard stuff. lmnicdiaiely following was
a composition entitled “Circus Of
Henven."This very up—bcat work.
borrowed many sounds of the circus with
their complicated multi-rhythms and
incorporated the voice of a young boy.
Anderson‘s son, reacting to it. Needless to
say this number included a conspicuous
organ line which Rick Wakeman turned
into a carnival type solo. As he played,
stage hands were raising and lowering
yellow cardboard horses from behind the
black barricade located around the
revolving stage giving the impression of a
carousel.

Among the other, numbers we heard
were “Awaken” from the Going for the
()llt' LP. and for 7711’ Yes Album fans we
also got a taste of”l’crpeiual Change" and
a rare rendition of “Starsliip Trooper.“
liven more surprising was Steve Howc's
acoustic soft), “The Clap" for which he
received effusive thanks, Squire was also
given the spotlight a number of times
for "Long Distance Runaround." “The
Fish" and for a new tune, “Don‘t Kill the
Whale.“'l'liis song is an
uncharacteristically political ballad in
support of the whale. It carries a strong
built and heavy bass line and seems sure
to gain alot of popularity upon the
album‘s release. The last piece we heard
iroiii the new album was called “On The
Silent Wings Of Freedom." This
impressive and dccidedlyjazzy number is,
more than anything, reminiscent of the
lea/uycr LI’ and includes some glowing
instrumental moments.

All too typically. the concert was then
closed with “All Good People" and
“Roundabout” as the surprise encore.
They were both appropriate in that many
of ilic concertgoers present came for just
those selections. The audience was
extremely receptive to the concert and to
the new material. Their concerts are
exciting and their sound is sufﬁciently
complex yet catchy to satisfy just about
everyone.

What about the next ten years‘l...ch?
Definitely.

Your Move has been together for two
years and has always had the
performance of its original material as its
goal. But because of ﬁnancial needs, this
was not always feasible. The group was
always forced to occupy its time

original material in order to be able to
Play local bars and thereby make a
