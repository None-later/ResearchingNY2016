“Who?”

. the Editor:

In the review of The Who's latest album,

titled “Who Are You". Jny Gisscn failed at

‘jnb of record reviewer by failing to supply
cxpert analysis of the album and its

-rrning. Instead Mr. Gisscnjustdisplaycd his

lack of knowledge. not only of The Who._but
of rock and roll and what it is about. It is
obvious to anyone who has heard "Who Are
You" and has followed The Who‘s music over
the last fifteen years. that Mr. Gisscn did not
listen to the album. but merely read the titles
of the songs and based his review on that.

Comparing “Who Arc You“ to the Stones‘
"Sonic Girls“ is rock and roll blasphemy. Mr.
(iisscn called “Some Girls“ a "classic
recording". when in reality all it is is anothcr
cxamplc of how the Stones follow every new
trend in music. in this case it's disco.

ln sharp contrast is The Who‘s history and
their new album. Again l’etc Townsend shows
us where rock and roll is at and where it‘s
future is. With songs like “New Song" and
“Music Must Change“ We scc that The Who
arc not going to fall into a creative rut. That's
the dillcrcncc between The Who and The
Stones; The Who are always progressing
without selling out thc incurring and purpose
ol rock and roll. The Stones arcjust out for the
money. “‘5 plain and simplc. The Who are
trcnd scltcrs and [he Stones arc trcnd
lollowcrs.

lltc review. however. is not a total loss. It
will comc in handy in case of a loilct papcr
shortage. lt thc death of Keith Moon means
the cnd ol lhc Who. llrcu. like in [970 when
the llcrrtlcs rctircd. rock will be without a
leader. and it could be as Townsend wrote a
couple of ycrrrs back “Rock is Dead. Long
l.r\'c Rock."

Manning the Mission

SUN YA's game plan for this year, entitled “Programs and Priorities
l978" was released last week by President Vincent O’Leary. It is an
ambitious document, to say the least.

In 1977, SUNYA‘s Mission Statement was ﬁnalized. Its introductory
remarks stated its purpose: “The Mission Statementis the beginning of a
process for‘ defining future directions of the University at Albany, a
framework within which priority decisions can be made and
implemented..."

The “implemented"part of that statement is what the “Programs and
Priorities“document is all about _

The document would like to clear up, in a year’s time, issues ranging
form advisement to distribution requirements to the quality of teaching.

Each of these issues, along with several others mentioned in the
document, deserves close attention and study. It is essential that the
implementation process also have an open dialogue with all segments of

l the university community. That is the only way to ensure that policy

changes and revisions will gain university-wide acceptance.

At this juncture. this scents to be exactly what O‘beary has in mind.
An open dialogue will be held, he has said. and if anyoneis displeased,
the forum for that displeasure will be open.

Hopefully, this pledge ofopen dialogue will hold true and be applied
to all of the issues in question.

The charts included in the document show that the caliber of the
SUNYA student is very high. The document also stresses the need for
teaching excellence and incentive programs for superior teaching. The
basic idea behind this makes sense:good teachers attracts good students.
To keep the faculty at their maximum is important, because it betters the
whole attitude about courses on campus.

There are scores ofissues within the document which can be examined
it a later date. The fact is that this document will have a tremendous
effect upon the l lives of SUNYA students. The goals are at times lofty.
but well intcntioncd. And ifthey arcn t reached by the end pfthe year, it
won’t be a great tragedy. But action should be initiated in all of the
mentioned areas and a concerted effort to succeed should be in effect.

Whether all of the priorities in this document are acceptable to all
concerned is yet to be seen. But the fact remains that “Programs and
Priorities,l978“ is not the end of the Mission Statement. It is the
beginning of the mission.
