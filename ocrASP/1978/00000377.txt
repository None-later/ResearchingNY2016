quiirilcdimn't tell the reader that the machines
rc set at such an incline as to rcndcrthc upper
.cctions of most pinbnll machines unplaynble.
it doesn‘t mention that the incline tends to
consume ballsin ploy faster than their puband
tavern counterparts. not does it hint that one
must ruck up an almost impossible amount of
points on a machine (there is talk of being able
to substitute your first born male child) for a
free ball. '

it seems to me that there is only one motive
lor Ihcsc atrocities: A profit for U.A.S.

Therefore. my suggestions are as follows:

The ASP. nlong with its usual fine job of
cxpousing tlIc virtures of this campus, should
|ry to examine both sides of all stories and not
wait, in some cases, to read the editorial page
to find the other side.

U_A,S. should set their pinbull machines so
that they are a competitive recreational outlet,
nolnn impossible money swnllowcr as t hcynrc
ul prcscnt.

To do both would be in the best interests of
all students.

“Who?”

To the Editor:

in the review of The Who‘s latest album,
cnlilled “Who Are You", Juy Gissen failed at
lIisjob of record reviewer by failingto supply
illl cxpcrl analysis of the album and its
meaning. lnstcud Mr. Gisscnjustdisplnyed his

luck of knowledge, not only of The Who, but
of rock and roll and what it is about. it is
obvious to anyone who has heard “Who Arc
You“ and has followed The Who's music over
the last fifteen years. that Mr. Gisscn did not
listen to the nlhum, but merely read the titles
oi the songs and based his review on that.

Comparing “Who Are You" to the Stones'
“Some Girls“ is rock and roll blasphemy. Mr.
Uisscn culled "Some Girls" in “classic
recording“. when in reality till it is is another
example of how the Stones follow every new
Ircnd in music, in this case it's disco.

ln sharp contrast is The Who‘s history and
their new album. Again l’etc Townsend shows
us where rock and roll is at and where it's
luturc is. With songs like “New Song" and
“Music Must Change“ We see than The Who
are not going to lull into n creative rut. That's
the dil'lcrencc between The Who and The
Stones; The Who are always progressing
without selling out the meaning and purpose
of rock and roll. The Stoncsurcjust out for thc
money. It‘s pltIin IInd simple. The Who are
trend setters and The Stones are trend
followers,

The review. however, is not :1 total loss. it
will come in handy in cuse of n toilet paper
shortage. ii the dcnth of Keith Moon means
the end of 'l he Who, then. like in l970 when
the llcutles retired, ruck will be without it
lender, nnd ll could be us l’uwnscnd wrote it

Manning the Mission

SUNYA‘s game plan for this year, entitled “Programs and Priorities
. was released last week by President Vincent O’Leary. It is an
ambitious document, to say the least.

in l977, SUNYA‘s Mission Statement was ﬁnalized. lts introductory
remarks stated its purpose! “The Mission Statement is the beginning of a
process for defining future direction

priority decisions can be made and
The “implemented"part of that statement is what the “ Programs and

‘ The document would like to clear up, in a year's time, issues ranging
lorm advisement to distribution requirements to the quality of teaching.

Each of these issues, along with several others mentioned in the
document, deserves close attention and study. It is essential that the
implementation process also have an open dialogue with all segments of
the university community. That is the only way to ensure that policy
changes and revisions will gain university-wide acceptance.

At this juncture, this seems to be exactly what O'Leary has in mind.
An open dialogue will be held, he has said, and if anyone is displeased,
the forum for that displeasure will be open.

Hopefully, this pledge of open dialogue will hold true and be applied

The charts included in the document show that the caliber of the
SUNYA student is very high. The document also stresses the need for
teaching excellence and incentive programs for superior teaching. The
biJSlC idea behind this makes sensezgood teachers attracts good students.
To keep the faculty at their maximum is important, because it bottom the
whole attitude about courses on campus.

There are scores ofissues within the document which can be examined
It a later date. The fact is that this document will have a tremendous
effect upon the l irves of SUNYA students. The goals are at times lofty,
but well intentioned. And ifthey aren t reached by the end pfthe year, it
won’t be a great tragedy. But action should be initiated in all of the
mentioned areas and a concerted effort to succeed should be in effect.

Whether all of the priorities in this document are acceptable to all
concerned is yet to be seen. But the fact remains that “Programs and
l’rioritics,l978" is not the end of the Mission Statement. It is the
