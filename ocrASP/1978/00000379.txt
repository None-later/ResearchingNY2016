zziil‘w’as originally told he would be
sitting out indeﬁnitely. Anothcr'doc-
tor informed him he could play ifthe
ain wasn't too hampering. He
listened to the latter.

“The goalie and the halfback got a
bit tangled over the ball and it just
came out to me." Arnngo said of his
goalmlll had to do was slip the ball
around the goalie and into the net.
The onlythingdil'l'icultwns the angle
and ljust directed the ball along the
ground towards the open side."

The Danes‘ al'terthoughts on the

Division Hll contest clearly in-
dicated they thought they were San
Jose‘s equal and not merely a Divi-
sion lll school happy to have given
the Spartans such a battle.
Schiel‘i'elin seemed annoyed at the
penalty shot ruling and forecasted
better showings against Hartwick
and Onconta St.

“l‘m not happy with the closeness
of the game at all," said Mark
chzel. :1 Dane defenseman. “They
came down here with those great
wins, but out there they are just a
soccer team like us, I felt we should

have won."

Albany did lack an offensive spark
and Schiefl'elinsaid they would work
on juicing up the attack. “That‘ll
come with time though," he said.
“This isn't the toughest squad we‘ll
play all year, and we're gonna beat
some of those other Division 1
teams."

Tomorrow afternoon the Danes
play at chnc State. and then will
prepare for the big matchup at
Hartwick on Sept. 27. Their V'axt
home game is Sept. 30 against Divi-
sion Ill runner-Lip Cortland State.

“Mama would have been happy,
to see us tonight," Carlos Arango
said as he let! the licld following the
game.

Women Netters Begin Season 0n Positive Note

of their "tougher" opponents.
Dcncmurk, Maloy and Bard racked
up wins in the match for Albany.
Commenting upon her.team's cf-
torts thus far, Mann said, “We have
no strong doubles. It requires a lot of
work to get a team of doubles
together, but we must hurry because

ol'thc weather. We've bccnoutcvcry
day since classes started for two
hours, rain or shine.

"Tilt: team is a very enthusiastic
group oi 17 girls which has been
made easier to coach this season with
the addition at my assistant coach
Carole.“

Looking ahead. the entliusirisiit

and optimistic Mann ran ol‘l'a list of
matches and tournaments coating
up. “Right now. the biggest one is
our inalcli with the lcmalc cadets of
West Point (played yesterday).

Danes Face Kim Point Ibmorroui-

cominued from page sixteen

When Oncca wants someone to
hand off to, he can look to another
freshman for support. Tailback
Dean Doc (5'8", I70) broke loosefor
I45 yards on 20 carries against the
Coast Guard, and included in the
yardage was three runs for long
gains. “He‘s a big play lypc back,"
said Scdlicki. “He's not very big, bttt
he‘s got real good quickness and
great speed. Basically, he‘s a helluva
runner."

In the receiving department,
Kings Point possesses two small,
quick. verteran pass catchers in Tim
Mahon (510“, l60) and Fred Mc-
l)onough (5'8". ISO). Mahon
doubles as a punt return specialist,
and is a “tough kid,“ according to
Sedlicki. The speedstcr ol'the two is
McDonough, who caught six passes
irom his split-end position last week.

Another outstanding player is
senior CO'Cﬂplillll Michael Herig
(6'0". 208). “He‘s ll super lineman,"
communch Scdlicki ahout the

senior left guard.

“Kings Point is not a finesse offen-
sive team," summarized Sedlicki.
“They're a power team that lives on
discipline.“

Against a well disciplined squad
such as Kings Point, the Danes will
be hard-pressed to play an error-free
game. “We can‘t give away manytur-
novcrs.“ said Scdlicki, “because
that‘s just the type ol'tliing that they
will take advantage of.“

Condltlonlng

Another factor to be considered is
conditioning. "Being a military
school, they‘re always in great
physical condition," Sedlicki ex-
plained. “You know they're going to
be taking it to you in the fourth
quartcrjust as hard as they are in the
lirst."_

Playing Kings Point for the first
time ever, Albany would be thrilled
to go one-up in thcscrics. This can be
accomplished il the Danes rise tothe
occasion and become monster-
killcrs tor a day.
