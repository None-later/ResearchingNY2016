by Cathy Weglan I

The Albany State women's cross '
country team has ﬁnally realized
their goal. that of a healthy varsity
club with enough talent to make
itself known on the Albany State
sports scone.

Under the direction of coach Bar-
bara Palm. the women have every in-'
telrtion of making their ﬁrst com-
petitive season one to be
remembered. I

The Danes are a yOUng team;
mostly freshmen with one
sophomore and two seniors to round
out the roster. However, all are ex-
perienced. either at the high school
or college level.

Deb Roh'rmiller, a senior from the
Albany area. will be the only
member not competing in the team's

opening triangular meet a week from
today due to an injured knee. But
Palm indicated that Rohrmiller
should be in form by Sept. 30, when
the University of Connecticut ln-
vitational takes place.

When asked about the team‘s
prospects for this season, Palm had

only supportive comments. She'

stressed the team‘s positive attitude
and enthusiasm. and their
willingness to "help each other out.“
This last quality seemed the most im-
portant to Palm; the ability of the
squad to work together as a
cooperative group, and not as a
number of individuals.

Rohrmiller. who was recently
elected captain. two freshmen. Leslie
Price and Suzanne Steam and
sophomore Kim Bloomer all appear

to be strong runners with good
'potential. according to Palm. Yet the
coach expects great things from all
the competitors.

Albany‘s three-mile course willbe
the site of the Dane‘s opening meet
against the University of Vermont
and Southern Connecticut. The
women hope to make quite an im-
pressive showing against Southern
Connecticut. but the Vermont con-
test looms tougher. '

Impending Victory I

Regardless of Impending Victory,
the upcoming meet promises to be
exciting. Lacking a well-defined
place in Albany State sport‘s history,
the women‘s cross country team is
out to carve their own niche this
year. They are resting on the laurels
of no one.

 F First Inning

Lends Siena Over Albany

By Ed Gibbons

Siena blitzed Paul Cohen for four
runsand ﬁve hits in the ﬁrst inningas
the Division 1 Indians defeated the
Albany State baseball team. 6-2.

Each of Siena's first four batters
scored in the ﬁrst inning. giving the
in'dians a lead they held on to. Bob
Helm led off with a double, Mike
Hayner singled, Dave Smith walked
and Bob Bladel hit a bloop single.’
which brought home Helm and
Hayner. To make matters worse, an
Albany outﬁeld peg to an uncovered
third base instead of home, allowed
another run to cross the plate. Two
more Siena singles drove in the
fourth run. ‘

ning, Mitch Chusid doubled. then

Siena came back with a run in the
fourth as Tim Kcesey walked and'
was driven home by Helm‘s second

No further runs were scored until
the seventh. as the Danes got a run

second and scored on Andy Dym‘s
single. Siena scored in the bottom
half ofthe innin to ad their leadas

Dan DeOregory scored on Mike
Murphy's single.

Despite the score. Albany gave
Siena a competitive game. Albany
coach Bob Burlingame. however,
was disappointed with the outcome.
-"They got that early jump on us and
we couldn‘t catch up." said
Burlingame. "We could have beaten
them. i felt we should have scored
more runs. We hit the ball but we
couldn‘t score. After that ﬁrst inning

I it was a 2-2 game."

Each ofAlbany's ﬁrst eight batters
had a hit, with McCarthy and Dym
leading the way with two apiece.

' Oneonta

By Mke Dunne

In a varsity tennis match played'

Wednesday on the Indian Quad
courts, Albany State easily defeated
Oneonta 8-l. '

The Great Danes took ﬁve out of
the ﬁrst six singles matches and all
three doubles in winning their open-
ing SUN YAC contest ofthe season.

Number-one singles player Paul
Feldman and second ‘l'nan Larry
Linett both won handin for the
Danes in straight sets. Mike Fertig
had a tougher time with Ira
Bc'ezowskv. edging him 6-4. 6-4.
Albany's Dave MeMullen Was a vic-
tor in the number-six singled match.

Freshman Lane Lerner was a
bright spot for the Danes, as he won

lumps from pitched balls on each
side. At around the fourth inning.
Yankee pitcher Thad Tillitston
(there‘s a name for trivia experts) hit
(icorge Scott with a pitch. The mom-
lllotll Scott proceeded to charge the
mound and both benches im-
mediately cleared. l3aseball“brawls"

Enter Joe Pepitone. Pepi was
flamboyant, the controversial
Yankee with his own hairdryer(that
was unusual in those days). He was
also my favorite ballplayer. Pepitone
went onto tllc field and found a felloe

Pepitone grabbed some dirt from the

Throughout the years. the Red

things to my Yankees. I remember

called by the amps. Fenwny is tough
