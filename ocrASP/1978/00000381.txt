brilliant in the Danes‘ goal and his

played to a H regulation-play

Albany coach Bill Schicffelin.
“We‘re bringing some top teams in
here along with San Jose State. and
we hope to gauge something by the
response."

The response was less titan reserv-

Danes-Kings Point Opener:
Wishbone vs. The Monster

by Paul Schwartz

As the Danes travel to Kings Point
tomorrow for their season opener.
high hopes and jittery stomachs will
no doubt accompany them. The
mood of the team on the return trip
might very well depend on one key
question: Can the wishbone defeat
the monster?

traditionally a strong dcfcnsivc
icani. Kings Point utilizes a forma-
tion called the 5-2 monster defense.
fhis type of coverage employs a
"monster back“. a linebacker that
shifts positions depending on which
side he anticipates the play will be
run. lhc Albany wishbone offense
has the task of confusing and
manipulating I'cd Knight. the player
that fills the monstcr back position
for Kings Point. so their plays can be
effective.

“On paper. the wishbone always
beats the monster." explained
Dunes‘ offensive coach Mike Motto.

Carey Reneges On Health Fee

by Aron Smith

Governor Hugh Carey has reneg-
ed on a promise to student leaders
that he would publicly commit
himself to the repeal of the SUNY-
wide health fee if successful in the
Democratic primary race. according
to former SA President David Gold.

The promise came at a sitmmer
conference of student leaders from
throughout SUNY system with
Carey aides. among them Higher

Education Services Corporation of-
ficitil Eileen Dickinson. New
York State Commissioner of
Educational and Cultural Affairs
Hank Dullca. and Carey‘s son. Don.

According to SASU President
Steve Allinger. the promise was the
result of considerable pressure plac-
ed on Carey's campaign by SASU
and SUNY student leaders.

“Just recently. however. we got a
very cryptic message from the ex-
studcnt youth coordinator for the
Carey campaign." said Allinger. "He
said ‘the health fee will be with us for
a long while and it looks like l got
screwed'."

The coordinator. Sandy Gixovan-
iii of SUNY Stonybrook. resigned
when Carey failed to honor his com-
mittnent late last week. according to
Gold.

The controversy over the health
fee. an $8.50 charge appearingon the
bills of all full-time SUNY students.
h.is stemmed from charges that the
ice is being collected and placed in
the SUNY General Fund. and that it
is not in the lettst health-related. The
fee is not covered by tnost financial
aid programs. including 'l'AP. and is
viewed by SASU as nothing more
than a thinly-disguised “immoral
and illegal tuition increase."

According to SA President Paul
l'icldman. Carey‘s stand on the issue
remains. "the legislature put the fee
in. and the legislature should take it
out.“ However. Carey‘s “hands off"
policy presents some discrcpcncies in
his handling of the fee.

A l'tcr considerable lobbying in the
legislature anti after making a
presentation to the SUNY Board of
Trustees. SASU was able to con-

vince the Board last October to
remove the health fee from the
proposed l978-79 SUNY budget
presented to Carey forapproval. Ac-
cording to Feldman. Carey then
returned the health fee to the Ex-
ecutive Budget before presenting it
to the legislature. The budget was
passed.

SUNY‘s Board of'Trustees is now
studying a proposed budget for
l979-80. and according to Fcldman,
it includes "the same tuition [as this
year's]. the same room rent. the same
college fee. and the same health fee."

According to Feldman. SUNY
Vice Chancellor for Management
and Business Harry Spindler claims
as the reason for the inclusion ofthe
health fee in next year‘s budget that
“the health fee has been charged to
SUNY students. it's a part of the
SUNY revenue. and it has to be
shown to the Trustees."

“lftlie Trustees want to take it out.
they're going to have to lower
revenues." said Feldman. “We're
telling Spindler not to include the
health fee in the presentation to the
Board ofTrustecs. But he's goingto.
So we're going to have to argue
against the health fee at the Board of
Trustees meeting. This is the same
thing we did last year. all over

again.“

According to Feldman. the health
fee issue is presently being ap-
proached on two levels. On one level.
SA and SASU are trying to insure
that the health fee is not included in
the l979-80 budget. But on another
level. the two organizations are try-
ing to extract commitments from
gubernatorial candidates and keep
them to their word.

A definite commitment to repeal ‘

the health fee has been received from
Republican Gubernatorial
candidate Perry Duryea. according
to Allinger. He said that similar
assurances had been received from
unsuccessful Democratic primary
candidate Mary Anne Krupsak. A
meeting between SASU and aides in
the campaign of lieutenant governor
hopeful Mario Cuomo (who is
running on a ticket with Carey) was
cancelled “without sufficient
explanation.“

But SASU‘s spotlight will rip-
parcntly be fixed on Carey in the
next few days.

“This next week. I'm going to put
all the pressure t can master on the
Democratic campaign." said
Allingcr. “We're reiterating the
health fee asa top priority item along
with student voting rights in college
communities. If Carey won‘t come
otit against it. then we'll not think

twice about putting up a picket line
in front of his mansion in Eagle
Street. which will hurt him much
more than it did last year.“
Allingcr expects to get an answer
from Carey by the first week of Oc-
tober. after which SASU efforts will
be concentrated on the l979-80

SUNY budget.

"They‘ve had a year to mull it over
and a year to discover how wrong
they were." said allinger. “They can't
say they need a few more days to
study it. We‘re getting very im~
patient. and they‘re getting sick of
it.“

On-Campus Feature Film Plans Cancelled

by MJ. Memmott

A feature film which was to be
sltot on the SUNYA campus. using
several students as actors. has been
cancelled because of difficulties
within the corporation producingit.

Production of tltc movie was
halted before tiny film rolled when.
according to the filin‘s director John
llund. the Community
Communication Center‘s Executive
Director resigned and Hand rind
another person had to take over his
duties.

The Community Communication
Center (CCC) is a non-profit group

which was going to produce the film.
a “feature about university life.
politics and culture.“ Hand said. It
was the creation of Hand and
SUNYA Italian Studies Professor
(iiosc Rimanclli.

“We had it screen play developed
and began casting in Mid-May."said
lland. “Everything was set. the -
preproductioii work was done. the
money was there. everything. Then
things collapsed. I personally
cancelled it on August 20.“

lhc cast included (i SUNYA
st tidciits. along with various localac-
tors playng such rules as professors.

It was to focus on a female
sophomore and the emotional-
intcllcctual changes that she goes
through while at the university.

Filming would have taken place in
such places as dorms. quad parties.
classrooms. off-campus apartments.
and according to Rinnmelli in an in-
terview with the ASP on May l2.

Police Arrest Man Disrupting Cafeteria

by Steve ()ster

lluhert Dickey a former student
of SUNYA. was removed from the
Indian Quad cafeteria Sunday
evening by university police after
creating several disturbances and

 

resisting arrest. according to
SUNYA Police Director Jim
Williams.

Williams explained that Dickey.
"who is black. over six feet tall and
over 200 pounds." had somehow ob-
tiiiiied a meal card despite his non—
enrollment and had been harassing

students and creating disturbances
on the quad the past few days.

Students who witnessed the in-
cidents said that Dickey was acting
in a biuare manner. which included
yelling obscenities mid dancing
around. _

"He was carrying on a running
dialogue and jumping around the
room." said Amy Auerbach. an In-
diaii Quad sophomore. “it was really
pretty alarming."

"We received a general
harassment complaint and
dispatched two officers to the Indian
Quad cafeteria." Williams said.
“The officers subdued him verbally
and asked him to leuvc...bul he
returned within an hour and we were
forced to arrest and physically
remove him."

Williams said that Dickey was
charged with disorderly conduct aitd
resisting arrest. btit Wits not brought
up oti charges of assaulting an of-
ficcr.a serious felony. He is currently
awaiting a formal hearing in Albany

- County Jail.

"it was our recommendation that
he be placed in the psychiatric tier of
the facility.“ Williams said.

SUNYA Police Officers Theopilc
Mastersoo and Doug Kern. who
responded to the calls. said that they
received the first of the two com-
plaints at about 5:00 pm.

“We escorted him (Dickey) from
the crowded cafeteria and explained

to him...thnt if he continued to act
in this manner...we would be forced
to arrest him." said Masterson. "and
it appeared to us that he understood
what we were telling him.

Pattl Schwartz. and Indian Quad
sophomore who Wits present. said
that Dickey. as he was being fed
away by the officers “was dragging
his arms on the floor mid acting like
a monkey."

Kern mid Masterson explained
that it is "general departmental
policy to give breaks before arrests
are made."

"We‘re not an arrest oriented
unit.“ Kern explained. "We try to
avoid such action whenever
possible."

"Masterson and Kern said that
within an hour of issuing the war-
ning to Dickey. at approximately
6:00 pm. they received another com-
plaint. Subsequently. when they
arrived again. according to Master-
son. “the students in the cafeteria

asked us to remove him."

“He was sitting at a table." ex-
plained Miisterson. "and as a last
ditch effort to avoid arrest. we
offered to drive him home. However.
he did not rcspotid."

“We then told him that we would
have to use force and. when he still
failed to respond. we attempted to
cuff him."

According to the officers. Dickey
then attempted to “ptisfi. shove and
kick“ but was quickly subdued and
removed through the nearest exit.

lioth Kern and Masterson ex-
pressed remorse that physical
removal was necessary.

“We try to excercise whatever op-
tions within legal parameters that we
can before an arrest is made." said
Masterson. “but when we do use
physical force. We're trained to do it
with as little chance of injury to the
subject as possible."

Williams said that Dickey would
be given ti return hearing.

Director Sharon Woliii have had to
take over the CCC‘s operation. and
an expensive and time-consuming
project sucl its the feature film had
to give way to litiaiicial excgencics
“and said.

The film was budgeted for 320.000
according to llat'd. most of it com-
mg from private sources. SUNYA
was providing no funds foi the
movie but was allowing free access to
all parts of the school for filming.
lhis was a very important fact for
the success of the movie lland said.
because much cooperation was
needed from such areas as the catn-
ptts police. rcgistrr.s officc. and the
computer center.

At one time. however. there was
talk of SUNYA providing several
fliotisaud dollars for the film “and
said. but it never materialized.
SUNYA Vice President for Finance
and Business John llartigan said no
plaiis for the school to do so were
ever formed to the best of his
knowledge.

The possibility does exist that the
film could be made in the future.
however. “If the CCC was in better
shape. we could do it. With so much
of the work already done. its just a
question of having the time to coin-
plctc it. “Hand said.
