Israeli Occupied Land Key Issue

TEL AVIV. ISRAEL (AP) The
great unresolved issue of the Camp
David Mideast summit is the future
of about 100 Jewish settlements on
occupied Arab land.

Israel now is faced with a crucial
decision on those settlements. a deci—
si on that could be the key to ultimate
peace in the Middle East.

The settlements issue apparently
will have to be overcome before
there can be progress on such other
major and equally complicated
issues as the political future of the
West Bank and Gaza and the
emotional issue of control of
Jerusalem. with its Jewish, Moslem
and Christian holy places.

For Israel. the settlements are a
cornerstone of Zionism. clothed in

Carter began a diplomatic and

Sunday night was “one of the most

Carter said the talks had produced
“far more substance than anyone
dreamed." and he added:

“It‘s notjust an outline ofgeneral
principles. It gets to the heart of
every single issue that has divided
Israel and Egypt."

Mid East Leaders Face Congress

WASHINGTON (AP) The leaders
of Egypt and Israel. about to embark
on the delicate job of selling the
Camp David accords to their own
peoples. ﬁrst face a round of
questioning on Capitol Hill.

Uppermost in the minds of
members of Congress as they
prepared to meet with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin
were the critical tests facing the
agreements reached by the two
longtime adversaries.

Both men scheduled appearances
today before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and the House

International Affairs Committee.

Secretary of State Cyrus R.
Vance. meanwhile. was preparing to
leave on a hastin arranged trip in
hopes of winning backing for the
agreements from Jordan‘s King
Hussein and Saudi Arabia‘s King
Khalid.

Goal Is Support

Vance's goal, President Carter
told a nationally televised joint ses-
sion of Congress Monday night. is
“to secure their support for the
realization of the new hopes and
dreams of the people of the Middle
East."

The support of both nations is

considered vital to the outcome of

the “framework for peace" which

And Carter. in an extraordinary
appeal to the Isrealiparliament.ask-
cd it to approve the removal of
settlements from Egyptian territory
as a condition for peace.

“It is my strong hope." he said.
“that the question of Israeli
settlements on Egyptian territory
will not be the ﬁnal obstacle to
peace." The Knesset is scheduled to
vote within two weeks on the
settlements.

Syria and PLO Reject

Camp David Agreements

BEIRUT, LEBANON (AP) Syria
and the Palestine Liberation
Organization. the two biggest Arab
threats to Israel. both rejected the
Camp David agreements today as
expected.

“There can be no Middle East
peace without the PLO." said Yasser
Arafat‘s official spokesman in
Beirut. Mahmoud Labadi. “The
Camp David agreements totally ig-
nores the right ofthe Palestinians to
nationhood and an independent

ttate."
‘ Syrian Adamant

The Syrian government radio said
the outcome of the Camp David
summit would “bring no peace to the
Arab world and will solve no
problems." The broadcase reiterated
that Syrian President Hafes Assad's
government had committed itself in
advance to reject any agreement
:President Anwar Sadat and Prime

Minister Menachen Begin might
rcach.

Labadi said the ﬁve-year transi-
tion period for the West Bank ofthe
Jordan to which Sadat and Begin
agreed "means a legality facade of
five more years of Israeli occupa—
tion." .

"The agreement also ignores any
reference to Syria‘s occupied Golan
Heights." he continued. “Therefore
the Middle East will remain a
flashpoint in the world, aspot otten—
sion. because the new accords settle
none of the real problems.“

Other sources in the guerrilla
movement complained that the
framework agreed on at Camp
David took into account only one
third of the Palestinians. those living
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
and ignored the 2 million other
Palestinians in Arab countries and in
Western countries.
