COPY WATCH
A sign ofthe timesisthelatestin-
vention by Manitou Systems of
Chicago.

Manitou is out with an ofﬁce.

copier watchdog to prevent
employees from using ofﬁce copy
machines for their own personal
business. '

Manitou makes a device which
can be attached to a copying
machine; the attachment makes the
copier unworkable unless a little

plastic—coded card is inserted into a '

slot.

When the curd activates the
Manitou. the system records who
made the copies and how many were
made.

Manitou predicts that copy
machine costs for contpanies using
the new system will drop from 20 to
40 percent. For employees, however.
tlte price might just go up.

RISING COKE

A new Federal Government sur-
vey has found that the use ofeocaine
by young people jumped sharply last
year.

The Government‘s annual
National Survey 0n Drug Use for
the year 1977 reports that nearly one
in every ﬁve Americans betweenthe
ages of It! and 25 hasexpcrimcnted
with cocaine.

The survey found that ii percent
of the high school seniors question—
ed. or about one in every nine.
reported having tried coke. Three
percent described themselves as
users.

That same survey found that more
titan hall ofthc High School Seniors
polled 56 percent admitted to using

The three most popular drugs, the
government reports. were (in order)
tobacco. ﬁrst; pot. second; and
alcohol. third.

PLANT CANCER

The latest smoking warning is
about the health of plants, not
humans. '

The Pathologists at Mississippi
State University are warning that
gardeners who smoke cigarettes and
cigars can give their plants a virus
when they ltandle them.

Researcher William Moore says
what is called the Tobacco Mosaic
Virus can be easily transmitted to '
plants by a gardener who smokes.

The virus is not harmful to
humans, and in fact. is found in
about 60'percent of commercially
rolled cigarettes. When it comes in
contact with plants, however, the
plants invariably become stunted
and their leaves begin to pucker.

The plants reportedly most
affected by this tobacco virus are
tomatoes and peppers.

NOT CASAN OVAS
An Italian sociologist says that.
despite those reports you hear about
how great Latin lovers are. the truth
of the matter is most Italian men are

absolutely lousy in bed.

Rowena Davis says she has spent

Italians and has discovered that the

Davis claims that sexual hang-ups
produ‘eed by the Catholic Church
and by the traditional’moral codes of
the ltalian family turn most/males
into insecure, selﬁsh lovers. Says
Davis of the true Latin lover: “He is
invariably egoistic. selﬁsh. often
violent, and only seeking self-
satisfaction."

IT'S A GAS!

One of the latest crazes at --
tltousands of head shops around the
US. I mull canisters ﬁlled with
laughing gas. '

In Denver, where there's been a
run on the Inltro'usl' 'oxide can'-
tainers. shops have reportedly run
out ol'the gas within hours. Thecon-
taincrs are being sold at about 50c
apiece. Each caniister reportedly
produces a three-minute "giddy"
tigh.

Health officials warn. however.
that'overexposure to the gas can
produce damage to the central ner-
vous system and. very rarely.
perhaps even deatlt.
