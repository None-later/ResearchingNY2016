“The Fugue," originally
choreographed in 1970, was the most
austere work of the evening‘s
performance. There is no music as such
but the dance is performed by the
movement of the dancers” bodies. The
stamping, tapping feet and clapping
hands on a miked stage are ampliﬁed with
a cannon-like force.

The three female dancers in black
costumes and rust suede boots imitate
one another's .movemenls and
successively appear as a continuous
interwoven part with a well deﬁned
structure.

The recurring structure of the piece
evokes a “To Tell the Truth" imagery.
Will the real dancer step forward? Rose
Marie Wright, Jennifer Way, and Shelley
Washington, each with her own highly
individual characteristics, may step
forward.

Rose Marie Wright, veteran of ten
years with the company, is a tall, ample
woman. Dancers are not generally nearly
six feet tall. However, her movements are

' As a student in college, you

so grand that it is impossible to tire
watching her long leg reach through the
air and back to the stage floor. Shelley

Washington blends wide-eyed curiousity . ‘

with a certain evasiveness. In addition to
"The Fugue," Jennifer Way demonstrates
superb control in “The Rags Suite from
the Raggedy Dances."

The dancing of Tom Rawe and
Jennifer Way to Mozart and Joplin
compositions is entertaining Rawe
possesses the flexability and elasticity ofa
"Gumby" doll. Underneath the shufﬂes
and shakes, jolts and jars, and the easy-
going friendliness of the dancers
themselves lies a complexity as intricate
as the inside of a pocket watch.

Tharp has imposed stylistic variations
on the work and the theme continually
moves in one direction. Clothedin shades
of purple, Way and Rawe make their
rcappearances from the right side of the
stage. Upon each return, their
partnership grows a little more absurd
than the last time. During the Mozart
variations, intricate footwork is
performed. Each step is broken up and
the dancers perform the same material
while continually changing fronts.

“The Bach Duet," performed by
Richard Colton and Christine Uchida, is
set to the second movement of the
Cantata No. 78. Colton standing on stage
proceeds to spit and then to rub it into the
floor with a toe. During the piece, the
dancers turn and swirl one another
wonderfully, and spit not so wonderfully.

As one of the most respected
choreographers of her generation, Twyla
Tharp has been admired by both major
ballet companies and modern dance
choreographers. Twyla Tharp has won
public recognition as a choreographer of
original, sharp sighted works for the
Joffrcy and the American Ballet Theatre.
The attention of ballet audiences was
drawn to her after Mikkail Baryshnikov
danced in her creation, “Push Comes to
Shove." “Deuce Coupe" was

’choreographed for the Joffrcy Ballet.

Twyla helped create a new art on ice,
becoming the ﬁrst major choreographer
to collaborate with an ice skater. “After
All“ was created for Olympic Gold
Medallist, John Curry.
