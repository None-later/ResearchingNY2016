Women 'Netters Defeated;
Binghamton Triumphs 8-0

N by Janet E. Cami

Coach Peggy Mann's Albany
State women's tennis team dropped

.a 6‘1 decision to a "very good“

Binghamton team indoors at Capitol
Land of Albany on Saturday, after
defeating the female Cadets of West
Point on Thursday, 5-2.

Freshman Karen O’Connor, play-
ing in the third singles position,
nabbed the only win against the
SU NY rival with a l~6. 6-4. 6-0 score.
“it took her a little while to get going
in the match," Mann said.

Lisa Dennemark, Jane MaloyI
Sue Bard and Laura Murray all fell
to their Binghamton opponents in
singles action. Paula Sausville and
Michele Grant dropped a match in
the top doubles spot, as did Colleen"
Joyce and Kathy Thaler in the se-
cond position.

(Jose Game

Regarding the latter‘s loss by a 0-
6, 7-6, 4-6 score, Mann said, “we'll
be practicing tiebreakcrs on Mon-
day. it was close. They could have
won that tiebreaker inthc linalset.“

On a more optimistic note, Mann
titled the win at West Point. “a good
one on a beautiful day."
Dcnnemark, Maloy, Bard and
Murray tasted victory as did the se-
cond doubles team of Joyce and
‘l'haler.

“The West Point team." Mann
said, “is not terribly strong. They are
still in a building stage.

"It was, however, quite interesting
to eat dinner in the mess hall with
1000 men and only 200 women!"

The Great Danes 3-2 record will
be challenged tomorrow at New
Paltz. Mann feels the squad at the
sister state school is very weak. and
therefore, she will be taking those
who haven't yet played, to “see how
we do with the bottom."

Phillies Challenged By Pirates

PHILADELPHIA (AP) Greg
Luzinski said what had to be said for
a team that appears to be running
backwards in the National League
East Division Championship race.

"We've had our backs against the
wall before," said Luzinski, the
Philadelphia Phillies' long-ball hit-
ting outfielder. "We've still got a
two-game lead and they still have to
catch us."

The "they" is the Pittsburgh
Photos.

The runncrup Pirates beat Mon-
treal 5-3 Sunday for their sixth
straight victory and 19th in a row at
home. They kept the Phillies' “magic
number“ for clinching a third
straight East title to any combina-
tion of 12 Philadelphia triumphs or
l’iratcs' losses.

After the Phillies had lost 2—0 to
the last place New York Mets Sun-
day. Luzinski spoke softly about his
team's posture as it left for a six—
game trip -—w three games in Mon-

treal and three in New York.

“We have to play good baseball,
it‘s that simple.“ said Luzinski. who
went 0-for-4 as the MeLs' Mike
llruhcrt pitched his first major
league complete game and first
shutout.

“The other clubs are still going to
put it to us because we've won two
division titles in a row. There is no
sense looking for help. We have to
win it ourselves."

Poor Defense

The l’hillics not only didn't hit
Sunday against a pitcher with a 3-9
record and a 5.13 earned run
average, they played some poor
defense.

Lee Manilli opened the game
with a double to right and Elliott
Maddox singled him home. Starting
pitcher Larry Christenson balked,
Maddox moving to second.

After Christensun retired the next
two batters. John Stcarns bounced
one off third baseman Mike

Schmidt‘s glove. Schmidt recovered
and threw wild to the plate for an
error. Maddox scoring.

Bruhert allowed just four hits,
struck out five and only one
Philadelphia runner advanced as far
as third.

Despite winningtwice in thcthrec-
game series, Mcts Manager Joe
Torre said he still feels Philadelphia
will win the division.

“I just think they‘re the better
team." said Torre. "The l’hillies play
better baseball than the other guys

the Photos. The other guys make
:1 lot oferrors. They take themselves
out of ball games.“

Torre said he feels the l’hillies'
previous division winningcxpcricncc
might be the difference.

“Things can‘t be worse for them
than two years ago." Torre said.
“1 hey have been through it before.
that should benefit them. They‘re
_|tlSI not hitting. something they‘re
not used to.“

Netrrten Shut Out 08ng 9-0

continued from page twenty

Barnes broke immediately in the
next set, however. and held serve for
a 2-0 lead. He forsaked the baseline
totally and charged the net on every
opportunity. winning several points
with sharply angled forehand
volleys. The tall, sandy-haired
Oswcgo junior sprayed both corners
with volley winners the entire set and
ended with an ace to even the match.

"I started to think about the sore
ankle in the second set and l beganto
counter for it and it messed up my
timing." said Linett. who had an 8-l
record last spring. "Starting with the
third set I just stopped thinking
about it and concentrated on the
tennis completely.“

Lewis wanted Linett to default the
match afterthe second set, but Linett
persisted and strode out for the final
set. At H in the opening game-no
add scoring was employed —— the
Dane ripped it forehand down the
line for a winner and went on to
brctlk serve. With that shot as an

impetus, he ran the set out at love.

Mike Fertig was also an easy
winner for Albany, whipping oug
Bailey in the third singles slot. 6-0, 6<
1. Gene Gillespie. the only loser in
last week‘s opening triumph over
Oneonta, came back on Saturday
and won his fifth singles match from
Rajecr Chadhuaroy 6-3, 6-3.

Dave McMullen had continual
trouble with his serve, specifically his
toss, but relied on the remainder of
his game in a 6-4, 7-5 win for Albany
over Giavani Barsha. “it got to the
point where l was just tossing it up
there and hoping for the best," he
quippcd.

Doubles Win

Gillespie and Derrick Rubin
combined for a 6-3. 6-3 second
doubles win over Bailey andBarsha.
Third doubles was conceedcd by
Oswego due to Keevrl's injury as
their record fell to 0-3. Albany plays
again today when. after a long ride.
they must face pereninlly tough
Vermont.

Giants’ Quick Touchdowns
Ruin KC. Game Strategy

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ. (AP)
(iivcn a choice between running a
regular pro offense or the Wing-T
that the Kansas Chiefs operate, New
York Giants quarterback Joe Pisar-
cik feels there's no choice at all.

The Giants defeated the Chiefs 26-
10 Sunday on the strength of two
l’isarcik first-quarter touchdown
passes that helped eliminate the
cl'icctit'cness of the Chiefs‘ ball-
control offense.

“The key thing is when you run a

ball-control offense, like the Wing-T-

or the college Wishbone. it takes

eight minutes to score." said Pisar-
cik, in his second year in the
National Football League. “it's hard
to score on picturesque l4-play
drives. Too many things can
happen."

The Giants took the opening
kickoff and drove 7! yards in ii

plays, capped by l’isarcik's ll-yard'

TD toss to halfback Bobby Ham-
mond. I’isorcik hit Johnny l’crkins
with u 2l-yard scoring strike with
l:55 to go in the first quarter to give
the Giants all the points they would
need.

“It‘s so nice to put two out there
first." said I’isarcik. "They play so
conservative and when that happen-
ed. they didn‘t know what to do, cry
or call the police. Maybe they should
have called the police."
