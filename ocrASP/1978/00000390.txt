“Buzz saw" was the term Albany
State head coach Bob Munsey used
to describe the Coast Guard
Academy's cross country team
which Albany State fell victim to. 2!-
34. on Saturday.

Senior co-captain Mark Lavan led
the Great Danes with a third-place
ﬁnish in 23:43 on the 4.8 mile course.
Sophomore Sean Reilly. junior co-
captain Bill Mathis, junior Jack
Russo and freshman Bruce Shapiro
rounded out the top ten ﬁnishers in
grabbing the sixth. seventh. eighthI
and tenth spots.

Munsey called the Coast Guard
contingent. whom the Danes
defeated last season, "the best Coast
Guard team in at least six years.
They were very strong.

“There Were three bright spots in
Saturday's debacle. Our number one
ﬁnisher, Lavan. led the team for the
second meet in a row. Secondly,
Russo. who i pulled up from the
jayvee ranks, was a really bright
spot. He‘ll be given another shot so
we can ﬁnd out if his fourth place
among the team was a ﬂuke ~— but I
doubt it. He's a smooth runner. an
older guy. and an Army veteran. i
think the fact that he‘s older
physiologically is better for the
longer races. In younger runners, the
juices ‘just ain't set yet'."

“I‘m also happy thatShapiro plac-
ed ﬁfth on Saturday and fourth the
other day among Albany runners.
He's the ﬁrst of the group of non-
varsity men to make the varsity this
year.“

Additional Albany ﬁnishers inthe
race included freshman Bruce
James. sophomore Raymond
Marrero. senior Ed Von Bevern and
freshman Todd Silva in the llth

through 14th spots. Sophomores
Ken Carlstrom. Robert Sanchez.
and Matt Van Buren rounded out
the Dane‘s team.

Commenting further upon the
loss, Munsey explained. ‘_‘We weren‘t
mentally sharp and l detected this
before the meet. I was worried about
our attitude and it proved out. We
weren't ready.‘

“I think there are more important
places for me to psyche them. We
have a heck of a good team but we
had a rigorous three days prior to
this meet; a meet on Wednesday
(Albany shut out Vermont in their
season opener) followed by a full
workout on the two following days.
and then another meet on Saturday.
which is unusual. Often we will have
a complete rest day after a meetwith
a quick dash recovery the next.

“We didn‘t. however. follow the
usual because we're getting ready for
the rest of the season. There are
bigger things to be ready for. such as
Syracuse and Army.

“What more can you say? Nobody
likes to lose."

Looking into the future. Munsey
said. “After next week we're going to
realise what Custer faced as he look-
cd over Little Big Horn and saw ﬁve
thousand Indians. That is how I feel
as we prepare to go to Syracuse (on
Saturday) where we‘ll have to
struggle. The course there is
probably the toughest; hilly. rolly.
grassy and windy. The little guys
stand to get shoved around.

“We don’t know what they have,
but last year we beat them and they
had a good number of returning
veterans. We‘ll show up. providing 1
don‘t get lost on the campus."

Concerning Army. who the Danes
will also be competing against.

Munsey became animated but

retained the wait-and-see attitude ‘

which he held about Syracuse. “Ar-

my has lost a lot of veterans. but they _

are a peculiar animal. They have
some very healthy young specimens.
Both schools are unknown to us this
season. We don‘t know what they
can do. I‘m scared out ofmy britches
every time we run against them. or
prepare to do so."

Although he admits to being
“scared”. Munsey says of the up-
coming meet. "Without meeting
better teams we won‘t get better and
we would have nothing to brag
about. The team and I both voted to
move into the higher level Division
[1. known as the “University Divi-
ston".

The barriers will face these two
powerhouses. looking to beat the
Orangcmen for the second time in as
many years and to avenge last
season's loss to the Cadets.

Tuhtlck said that “the improve-
ment of relations between athletics

one of the main goals of the AFC.
Ford is currently looking into

several other possible methods of
raising revenue for athletics. Among

the projects under way are deals with
the Pop Warner football organiza-
tion and with the Albany Downtown
Merchants Association to distribute
football tickets with the profits to be
shared by the football team. Ford is
considering several other possible
promotional gimmicks in order to
come up with more income. “We

have to explore various methods of

helping ourselves." concluded Ford.

Meanwhile. Tobnck is confident
that the new policy which was
enacted will be a success. “I am
definitely in favor." said Tohack. “of
charging fifty cents admission for
home athletics."

Ali." Al? Ali!

by Paul Schwartz

It was his presence that caused their attendance. His long jabs
brought them to shout. The speed of his legs made their hands come
together. At the end. it was the man himself that made them shake their
heads in wonderment.

The lecture center was not quite half full when Iarrived. It was 8:00.
but the man I came to see. Muhammad Ali. would not appear on the
large screen for at least another two hours.

A preliminary fight was being shown. but my interest in it was
minimal. and what interest lhad quickly waned. There were moments
of excitement. but it was no more than a warmup. If you think this
guy's good, wait till you see the ﬁnal act. I hear they‘ve got a ﬁnale
that‘s something else. '

The concerns of others in the crowd also wandered from the goings
on on the screen. So where‘s the beer was the general consensus. There
would be one. possibly two more prelims before THE ﬁght. Yea. where
WAS the beer already? ‘

The second ﬁght and the beer arrived simultaneously. The beer won
hands down. As the beer went down. the action picked up. Rossman
vs. Galindez. not bad.

It wasn‘t bad. Rossman was the crowd choice. and he used his '
somewhat awkward style to upset the champ. We‘ve got a new light-
heavyweight champion. OK. enough. It was all very nice. but let‘s stop
playing games. It's show time.

The crowd thought so too. A small. reserved crowd becameswelled;
an air ofdrama. a buzzing ofanticipation ﬁlled the room. The mere an-
lnouncement ofthelong-awaited ﬁght drewapplause and whistles. Yes.
the crowd was ready.

As always there was Cosell. His non-stop discourse was. to be kind.
not extremely appreciated by the majority. But for some reason, I
didn‘t mind him. He is part of the scene; a commentator in a pageant.
And this was a pageant.

Still more time to kill. Put on highlights of Ali's career. Good move.
the crowd loves it. A young Ali was not a boxer. he was a wizard. His
wand was his fists. be cast spells with his legs. As wide eyes and open
mouths sat and watched. the screen showcd Ali dispose of themall.

Stay up with Muhammad and watch the stars come out. One by one
the celebrities filled the screen. The biggest names in show biz. Even
they are a rung below him. One by one they cling to him; they can tell
all their friends that they met Muhammad Ali.

It's time. The 70.000 in the Superdome begin to stir. as dothe 300in
'l.C-2. The stirring becomescheers. ﬁrst soft. then loud. then explosive.
Ali emerges. He needs no staff to pan the masses that surround him.
IExpressionlcss. he enters the ring; a challenger. on paper at least.

The star has been introduced. bring in the understudy. Spinks. The
name inspires no thoughts of greatness. It isjust a name. as he isjust a
boxer.

The once spacious room was now stuffy. My hands felt sweaty. my
stomach was churning. The fight had begun. No. ldon't want another
beer. One must have a clear head when one watches history.

No doubt about it. it's an Ali crowd. No real surprise. it's an Ali
crowd everywhere. Early impression; Ali looks off. he isn't sharp. But
he‘s dancing. He can't keep it up.

Ali now looks better. In fact. he looks damn good. And look. he's
still dancing. As the fight continues. a strange feeling is present in the
crowd. They do not merely cheer wildly. they show concern and can-
tion. Cover up. hold on. watch out for the left. It is as if the crowd is
warning an old friend. Not just emotion. but concern.

You know. I think he‘s won the last two rounds. He‘s winningthe
light. And my God. he's still dancing. Then. the All shuffle. A pleasant
memory shared among friends. The crowd goes bananas. Every punch
results in a cheer. The ending of a round is cause for hysterics. The
round belongs to Ali. and the fight is not far behind. I

The ISIh round. Hold him. don‘t let him hit you. Dance. Hold him.
hold him. Concern. The round ends. He‘s done it. Cosell's talkingto
him first. now you know he's done it. Give your attention to the ring
announcer. As loud as the crowd has been. it's now hushed. The
referee: Ali. The judges: Ali. It wasn't even close. We've got a new
champion. No. the champ had never left.

The crowd ﬁles out. They are smiling. They slap hands and shadow
box. It was one ma n‘s doing; it was one man's night. The crowd has dis-
sipnlcd. the smiles remain. It was morethan one man's night. Therein
lies the magic of The Man.
