it has almost turned into a team
slogan. When talking with Albany
State football players and coaches.
especially head coach Bob Ford,
you‘ll hear the phrase. “We can't
beat ourselves." But in Saturday‘s
season opening [4-8 loss to the Kings
Point Mariners. that's exactly what
the Danes did.

“We walked off the field,“ Ford
said, “and there was no question that
we could have won, probably should
have Won. and sure as hell shouldn't
have lost."

An 8-8 tie seemed most probable.
After an aerial by starting Albany
quarterback Brad Aldrich was pick-
ed offWith |:40 left in the contest.the
Mariners had the ball on their 37-
yard line. lfthe Danes‘ defensive unit
could have continued their excellent
play. both teams would have been
left “kissing their sister."

However, a defensive breakdown.

enabled Kings Point to put together
their longest drive of the game for
the come-from-behind victory.

Netnien Sweep Away Oswego 9-0

by David Osborn

An hour before their scheduled
tennis match with OsWego Saturday
afternoon. the Danes' men's tennis
team was engaged in a makeshift
cleanup operation. utilizing mops
and brooms to prepare the
rainsoaked lndian Quad courts for
the pending competition.

Once they had completed the ﬁisk

and the tennis balls begun to fly. it
became readily apparent that
groundskceping would be Albany's
most demanding job of the day.
Throughout the program. the Danes
played crisp. consistent tennis and
easily whipped Oswcgo beneath
occasional showers. 9-0.
' Rain Friday night had left the
courts a mass puddle by Saturday
morning. However. the peppery
work by squad members cleared the
surface substantially enough for
matches to begin. A sporadic
sprinkle sent some players sliding
about at points. but the Danes held
their traction quite well and gained
their second consecutive win of the
season. _

Paul Feldrnan. the three-time
defending SUNYAC champion. had
little trouble in pushing aside
Oswego‘s number-one player Chris
Kecvrl. in} a 45-minute 6-2, 6-0
triumph. Feldman controlled play at
will and scored constantly with
cross~coun backhand passing shots
and a number of teasingdink volleys
off attempted Keevrl passes.

The power of Keevrl's main
weapon. a big kick serve. was
diminished considerably when he

strained a muscle in his right arm 

the fifth game of the opening set.
after gliding on a wet spot. He was
hampered during the rest of the
match and opted to skip the doubles
play which forced ()swego to forfeit
the third doubles match.

Albany's top new addition
continued to show promise in
gaining his second straight-set
victory. Lane Lerner. the.

 

bespectacled freshman third singles
player. countered the serve and
volley game of Jim Cline with a
varied service return and coasted to a
(i-l. 6-2 win. Later he teamed with
Dave McMullcn to win the first
doubles match 6-4. 6-2.

“So far I‘m very pleased with
Lane‘s playand I think he‘llcontinue
to improve for us.“ said Albany
coach Bob Lewis. “He's going to be
playing doubles for us in the ECAC
tournament along with Dave so I
wanted to give them an opportunity
to play together before their. They
looked alright today but they‘ll need
some additional work.”

l'he only Dane to lose a set was

second singles player Larry Linett.
A sore ankle slowed down the
usually lieet junior and the dump
court contributed to his struggle. but
he prevailed over Larry Barnes in the
longest match of the afternoon. 6-3.
3-6. 6—0.

l.inett. with short. scraggly-curled
hair. plays a precision-based game
using a flat two-fisted backhand and
an assortment of chips and spins to
outlast his opponents and not
necessarily overpower them. He
blasted an ace in the ad court to hold
serve and led 4—2 in the first set.
before breaking serve and taking the
one-set advantage.

seconds left. King Point quarter-
back Sam Oncea faded back and was
faced with four Dane defensive
linemen looking for the critical sack.
While scrambling. Oncea spotted

broken away from his original
pattern, all alone in the end zone.
“He was going to throw just to get
the ball down further." said Danes'
defensive coach .lack Sedlicki. “He
had six or seven seconds before he
finally threw the ball. Somehow we
lost him (Mahon) on the other side.
We didn't have anyone near him."
The end ofthe ﬁrst halfended on a
similar chaotic and damaging note
for the Danes. Ahead 8-0 on the
strength of a first-quarter two-yard
touchdown run by Aldrich. the
Danes were in excellent ﬁeld posi-
tion on the Mariners' l7-yard line,
after a l5-yard punt return by free
safety Cal Flint. On second down

quarterback Terry Walsh rolled to

receiver Bill Zieman. instead.

Mariners' linebacker Tom Davis was
the recipient. and with the help of
some good blocking. sped down the
sidelines for an 86-yard touchdown
return. followed by the entire Danes‘
defense.

“That was a disastrous sequence
of events." said Ford. “We had a
chance to kick a ﬁeld goal." Danes‘
defensive captain Kenny Paulo said.
“We Went into the locker room and
we couldn‘t believe it. it was like we
were dreaming."

Albany‘s triple—option wishbone
offense had nightmares all after-
noon. Aldrich and Walsh completed
an unimpressive four of l l passes for
55 yards. More noticeable, though.
was the absence of Albany‘s run-
ing game. Only one week ago in a
scrimmage against Middlebury. the
Danes' halfback foursome of Levi
Lewis. Bruce Churchwell. Jack

the big gain. seemingly play after

tive. combining for 25 yards on 23

Fifty-Cent Game Admission Fee Initiated

by David Spiro

As a result of last year's
devastating athletic budget cuts.
Albany State students will now be
charged a ﬁfty cents admission fee at
all home football and basketball
games.

in addition. the football team will
be playing an evening contest at
Blacker Stadium in downtown
Albany this Saturday night with the
purpose of increasing revenue and
helping to bring about a closer
relationship between the Albany
community and the University.

The new policy of charging for
home athletic events is the result ofa
bill which was recommended last
year by the Athletic Finance Com~
mittee (AFC) and subsequently
passed by Central Council. The bill
is intended to help maintain the
quality of SUNYA athletic
programs despite last year's budget
cuts.

"No. I'm not in favor ofcharglng."
said Albany Athletic Director and
head football coach Bob Ford. “but
we're doing it out of necessity."

Ford indicated that because ofthe
severe cuts and spiraling inﬂation
that the athletic teams were facing.
new methods of funding bad to be
found. "i don‘t know what methods
we‘ve got except tochargc." he said.

Ford noted that unlike many
other schools. Albany could not rely
on its alumni to solve the funding
problem. “We are not a Michigan
State or a Yale alumni.“ said Ford.
“There is no tremendous emphasis
on athletics here. Support from our
alumni is helpful. but it will notcarry
the program.“ .

Alan ’l‘obuck. the newly ap—
pointed chairman ofthe AFC agreed
with Ford that charging for home
games was a necessary step. “There
just aren't that many ways of in-
creasing funding besides charging."
said ‘l‘obuck.

Due to the budget cuts last year.
the AFC was forced to drop
programs in four junior varsity
sports w lacrosse. track. and men's
and women's tennis. Golf. sailing.
the awards system. banquets and
sports clinics were the other victims

of the financial problem. Although
he would rather not charge for the
l'botball ttnd basketball contests,
Ford contested that "it's either that.
or which future sports do you want
to cut?“

Both Ford and 'l'oback agreed
that there could be several problems
with the new policy. especially in
terms of football. "Due to the
physical makeup of the athletic
field.“ said Toback. "it might be dif-
ficult to collect money." Ford said
that although a fence would be put
up around the football‘ﬁeld. enforce-
ment of the policy would still be a
problem.

However. neither Ford nor
'l'oback anticipated any problem
with student support. “1 don't expect
a negative student reaction.“ Ford
said. "It was pretty well publicized
last year when we were having the
budget problems.“

The results of a-survey of 4000
SUNYA students seem to support
Ford‘s belief. Seventy-five percent
of those surveyed indicated 'they
would be willing to pay for athletic

 

events. while 50 percent said they
would be willing to pay fifty cents or
more for the home games.

The iileeker Stadium games are
another possible method of
generating much needed income.
The Dancs' soccer team. which
played last Wednesday night against
Division 1 San Jose of California.
was helped out by McDonalds.
which gave out free tickets to kids.
The attendance for the game was
2400.

The Danes football team will play
at Bleeker Stadium this Saturday
against Southern Connecticut.
another Division l team. There will
be free buses to the game for
SUNYA students. “I hope we get
great student support." said Ford.
“All of our teams play an aggressive
brand of intercollegiate athletics."

The Athletic Director is also look-
ing forward to another beneﬁt ofthe
Blocker contest. “One of the things
that disturbs me." said Ford." is that
we have never been adopted by the
Capital District. There has never

SASU is launching a statewide
protest aimed at pressuring Gover-
nor Hugh Carey into honoring a
committment he made with student
leaders to repeal the health fee. ac-
cording to SASU President Steve
Allinger.

Petitions bearing copies of
Tuesday's ASP editorial assailing
Carey‘s failure to delete the con-
troversial student health fee as

promised will be circulated on all
SUNY and CUNY campuses.

The controversy over the health
fee. a $17 per year charge to all full-
time SUNY students. stems from
charges that the collected monies are
being placed in the SUNY General
Fund. which is not at all health
related. it is viewed by SASU as a
thinly disguised “immoral and it-
legal tuition increase."

Governor Hugh Carey mas take a pro or con stand on the

Carey and New York State's Division of the Budget are
currently attempting to construct a viable plan for the repeal
of the health fee. according to Sangiovanni. lfsuch a plan is
successfully worked out within the next week. he said. Carey
may make a public statement on the issue at that time.

raising taxes or destroying programs." said Sangiovanni.
who was reluctant to set a target date for a gubernatorial
commitment. “There is always the possibility that they will
not be able to find a way. and I don‘t want to disappoint so

Sangiovanni denied any knowledge of the alleged Carey
campaign promise to student leaders. “Carey has always
viewed the health fee as something enacted by the legislature
and something which can be removed only by legislature."he

As the result of considerable lobbying and a petition drive
by SASU. SUNY's Board of Trustees removed the health fee
from the l07li~79 Executive Budget presented to Carey.
According to SA President Paul Feldman. Carey returned
the health fee to the budget before sending it on to the
legislature for approval. This budget was approved by the
legislature and passed into law after being signed by Carey.
As a result. the health fee remains.

According to Sangiovanni. Carey acted as he did only
because such was the legislature's will.

successfully in the legislature and the
SUNY Board of Trustees to remove
the fee from the l978-79 budget.
However Carey reinserted the fee
before returning the budget to the

According to former SA President
Dave Gold, Carey promised to
publicly commit himself to the
repeal of the fee if successful in the
recent Democratic promary race.

However. Gold said that Carey
failed to honor his commitment after
Winning last week's primary.

Allinger said that this yearSASU
would concentrate its efforts not in "

Overcrowding Pinch Still Felt

by Jeff Kennel!

Between 65 it"i ’5 women
students remain tripled in dorm
rooms as a result of the on-campus

male students who requested new
housing have received it. as Well as
two thirds of all students who were
tripled or diplaced because of the
overcrowding. according to Director

504 Task Force Finishes Work

by Marie Cortbsoz

The 504 Task Force on the dis—
abled has completed its review of
SUNYA compliance with section
504 ofthe Vocational Rehabilitation
Act of [973. according to Task Force
co-chuir Gloria DcSolc.

This law states that no qualified
handicapped person shall be sub.

A recently released campus self-
cvaluation report on section 504 out-
lines how the law has been complied
wit h. as well as recommendations for
the future.

“SUNYA is currently in technical
compliance with the law." said Afﬁr-
mative Action Associate DeSole.

being reformed this year to “imple-
ment some of the recommendations
made in the self -evaluntion." Dean
of Student Affairs and C0~Chair
Neil Brown acted with DeSole in
coordinating eight committees on
speciﬁc areas such as academics and
budget. Much of the work was done
in those groups.

The biggest problem on campus is
attidues: according to the 504 Task
Force. a disability is a physical.
emotional or sensory impairment
and a disability only becomes a ban-
dicap when society creates barriers.

The Academic Adjustment Com-
mittee printed a pamphlet that will
be distributed to faculty during the
semester. it contains practical
suggestions on how to help the dis-
abled student. For example. any
material written on the blackboard
must be Verbalized for visually im-
paired students. Teachers should be
prepared to furnish a text two
months in advance so blind students
can have it recorded on tape. When
teachers or texts are changes. as fre-
quently happens. the blind student is
often not notified. according to Stu-

iticlll Task Force member Roger

lieudion.

There are many services available
for the disabled students. according
to the self-evaluation report. A free
adapted van is available. campus
orientation tours are given. the
library contains special equipment

of Residences. John Welty.

On Sept l. Rsidence housed 50
students in RA suiterooma. and 70
more in Brubucher's basement.
Sayle‘s loungcrooms. and quad
guestrooms. One hundred and six-
teen students were living in tripled
rooms. amounting to 236 displaced
students. Of this total. lbl have been
housed. while 75 remain waiting.

Welty admitted that women were
suffering the brunt of the housing
shortage. but added that housing
was being provided as quickly as
possible.

Welty said that the Admissions
Offices is identifying more no-shows
each day. and that these additional
spaces are being filled by tripled and
displaced women. Open release has
been closed for men while open
release continues for women. he
said. “Many men chose to remain in
tripled rooms.“ said Welty. This
helped cut the need for additional
male housing."

Director of the University Ad-
missions Office. Rodney Hsrt. said
that there are no freshmen and 2
transfer students above the number
planned. The l52 extra. un-
dergraduates constitutes a 5 per cent
mm on the part of Admissions.said
l'lart.

Hart explained that the Office of
Admissions dedided. through a com-'
plex formula to admit 2.100 fresmen ‘
and 850 transfers for the l97B—79
school year.

A lower than expected turnout of
juniors. seniors and graduate
students balanced the scales of the
“total ltcadcouut enrollment"
however. said liart. Admissions pro«
jected a total university enrollment
of H.790. and tut of today that
ntunber stands at H.791.

“in retrospect. if we did cut down
onfrcslunan admissions. we wouldn‘t
be on our budgeted target for this
year's total enrollment.” said Hurt.
llat't explained that "total head-
count enrollmenl“ is different than
the number of students housed by
SUNYA. The accuracy of the total

enrollment figures haVe little bearing
on the optimal provision of on-
campus housing.

Many variables are taken into ac-
count when providing housing for
incoming and returning students.
said Hart. “Our policy is largely the
headcount and HE [full time
equivalence] driven." Admissions
must set and meet practical
graduate and undergraduate pop-
ulation-goals. said Hart. '

As for Admission‘s policy of pur~
poser “over—enrolling a number of
freshman and transferstudcnts. Hart
said. “These are tight budyt times.
we don‘t want to risk losing faculty
lines. for this means a loss of flex-
ibility." Hart said thatclosed courses
and loss of faculty lines were im~
plications of a failure to meet
budgetary targets for total enroll-
ment. “We've all seen retrenchment
and reductions in lines. we don't
want to experience them again." he
said.

Hg said that given the current
method of preregistration. “two or
three weeks of hell" "Ls nearly in-
evitable in the area of housing shor-
tages.

"There are no physical means by
which We can tell a returning student
has actually returned." said Hart. A
possible solution might be to have all
students register about a week before
