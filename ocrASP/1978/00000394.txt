The seventh annual Community-
University Day will be held at

2 . SUNYA Oct. 7.

This years program will focus on
the College of Humanities and Fine
Arts. In addition. the Biology
department. Atmospheric Science
Center. Computer Center and other
departments. groups and
organizations will be givinga variety
of presentations.

According to Assistant Vice Presi-
dent for University Affairs Sorrell E.
Chessin. “The main goal of
Community-University Day is to
strengthen ties between the Universi-
ty and the community. We are
dependent upon a good relationship
with the community and by running
an open house once a year, 'we give
our neighbors a glimpse of whatthe
University is all about."

He considers this a “public
relations gesture." and said that the
residents of the community. as tax-

payers. have a right to know where
their money is going.“

Chessin approximates the cost of
Community-University Day to be
around $4.000, the same as last year.
This allocation. which comes from
the SUNYA budget. covers the cost
of printing programs, mailing an-

nouncements and invitations to the
public and buying some commercial
advertising time.

Assistant Dean of the College of
Humanities and Fine Arts. Larry
Farrell regards the fall event asa way
to “advertise the university's interest
in relating to the community. The

question is not just what the univer-
‘sity can do forthe community. but.
also what the community can do for
and with the university.”
Community-University Day is be-
ing held in conjunction with three
other big events: the Alumni
Homecoming. the Great Danes-vs-
Towson State football game. and
President Vincent O'lreary's 'in-
auguration. Chessin believes that the
turnout for theday's activities will be
highly dependent upon the weather.

He blames last years tow attendance
of around l0.000, as compared to the
12,000 to l5.000 of previous years on
the overcast weather.

It is felt that due to the festive at-
mosphere of the day. some people
might’ be tempted to 'thinlr ' of
SUNYA as a “barrel of fun.".“fun
and games," “not a serious
business.“ according to Chessin. But
he hopes to counteract that line of.
thought by presenting to the public
the research and educational
facilities of SUNYA.

HACKENSACK. NJ. (AP) The
New Jersey Supreme Court upheld
contempt convictions of the New
York Times and Times reporter
Myron A. Farber on Thursday. and
ordered Farber back to jail unless he
surrenders notes to a judge in a
murder case by Tuesday.

Attorneys for Farber and the
Times said they would anoealtothe
U.S. Supreme Court-probably
ion Friday. _

in a 5-2 decision. the state court
found that neither the First Amend-

.
merit to the U.S. Constitution nor a
state newsman's shield law protects
Farber from having to surrender his
notes in this case.

it found the shield law in-
applicable when it conflicts with the
constitutional guarantee of a fair
trial ~— and particularly in this case.
because Farber had cooperated with
the prosecutors.

The case involvu a major conflict
