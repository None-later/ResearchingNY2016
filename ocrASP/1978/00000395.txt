BATH HASH

Health freaks beware. Those
whirlpool baths you thoughtwereso
good for you might just make you
sick instead.

The Journal of the American
Medical Association reports that
people who are basking in the
delights of hot whirlpool baths often
contract an uncomfortable skin con-
dition which results in unsightly red-
dish bumps ‘cvcrywhere on the body
except the neck and head. Health ex-
perts are attributing the prickly rash,
which can last anywhere from a few
days to several weeks. to impure
whirlpool water.

The Journal also says that some
victims of contaminated whirlpool
water may even come down with
sore eyes, abdominal cramps and a
sore throat.

The Journal concludes that. like

, some tests

whirlpools should be regulated by
local health departments so that
when you go to take a health bath,
you don‘t come out looking like you
have the measles.

HOLY FISHI

A Government-run television sta-

llion in South Africa has refused to

broadcast a commercial for Walt
Disney cartoon because it contains
the expression “holy mackerel."
The offending words. spoken by a
mouse in a cartoon titled “The
Rescuers". were ruled possibly
sacreligious by South African cen-
sors. A public relations spokesper-
son for the South African broad-

feared that religious viewers would
be insulted by repetitive advertising
employing the phrase “holy
mackerel."

A spokesperson for the dis-
tributors of the cartoon in
Johannesburg reasoned “We really
did think that ﬁsh were innocuous.
whatever their level of divinity."

WEIGHT DEBATE

You‘re probably fatter or skinnier
than you think you are. .

A study by Fordham University
researcher Susan Gray concludes
that overweight people often view
themselves as being thinner than
they actually are. and that un-

as being heavier thanthey really are.

Gray surveyed 179 male and
female undergraduates, ranging in
age from l8 to 60. 0f these.32.8 phr-
cent were underweight, 36.1 percent
were overweight, and 36.2 were nor-
mal. when measured against charts
developed by the Metropolitan Life'
insurance Company.

Gray had each of the un-
dergraduates describe themselves.
however, and she reports that nearly
half oflhose in the sample were mis-
taken in their perception oftheir ae-
tual weights. She says that 65.9 per-
cent of the subjects viewed their
bodies as being of normal weight.
only 7.8 percent thought they were

GOOD EGGSAMPLE

A high school teacher in New
Richmond;:"Wisconsin, give her
family living classes an unusual
assignment to illustrate the'problems
of parenthood.

Each of the 90 students was asked
to care for a raw egg for a week,
treating it as if it were a baby. They
had to keep a constant eye on their

"egg" child or arrange for a
babysitter.
Students reported that their

parents were the best babysitters”
Some students dressed the egg
babies and gave them toys. By week's
end. 75 percent of the eggs were
returned in healthy condition. 15
percent were "injured" and 10 per-
cent were "fatalities." The eggs had
been marked initially so sub-
stitutions were not possible.

One student whose “baby” sur-
vived. sounding like a doting parent.
reported: “I still have my egg. lt's
spoiled rotten."

DULLPHINS

Dolphins. whales and other
animals which are used to appearing
irt Sea World shows apparently get
very depressed when there are no
audiences to perfortrl for.

Southern California‘s
Marine-land, which closed for
remodeling last November, reports
that soon after the closing. the
dolphins were sulking. the sea lions
were getting fat and the killer whales
were depressed.

Murineworld animal trainer Tim
Desmond says that the 25 dolphins
which were used to people cheering
and petting them when they per-

" l'ot'iited hhvc'bécﬁiti?“diivlohsly in—

secure" and unhappy from looking

Desmond says that Marineland
ltnally resorted to importing school
children to come and see the poor
creatures at least once a wcckjusl to
give them a lift.
