’ith the release of their latest
album Dog and Butterﬂy,
Heart has finally come
through with an album that is
completely energetic.‘ The
group appears to be at the height of their
musical renaissance. While the album
contains elements of all three previous
Heart albums (particularly the great
“Little Queen" LP), the entire album has
a very fresh new sound and the rawenerge
in it greatly transcends that of the three
other releases.

Scott Snyder

The approach on the albums is
straightforward; the A Side is the “Dog”
and the B side the "Butterfly". The two
sides differ in style but the quality remains
top-notch throughout the album. The
Dog side is generally the "heavier" of the
two, consisting of relatively funky upbeat
numbers. The “Butterfly” side is less
electric and generally slower but still
contains the raw energy of the "Dog" side.
The "Dog" side opens with a live out
called “Cook With Fire“; a ﬁery upbeat
rocker with all the polish of the studio
cuts. It definitely sets the pace for the rest

 

“Leo Sayer"

' he Roger Daltry-discovered
English singer turned disco-
pop superstar has taken an
about face on his new album,
simply entitled “Lco Sayer."

The Album is a generally soft-rock

outing, filled with slow ballads and an

occasional upbeat rocker. With helpfrom
noted musicians such as Waddy Watchel
and Fleetwood Mac‘s Lindsey

Buckingham. the new album displays a

more mature, less commercial side of Leo

Sayer.

Opening side “A” is the self-penned

midtempo love-ballad “Stormy Weather

which leaves the listener with a good
impression of what to expect on the rest
of the album. The lyrics have a sublime
eurthiness and are among the best Sayer
has ever written. “Dancing the Night

Away" may lead one to believe that it's

“disco-time" by it's title. No “You Make

Me Feel Like Dancing“ here though; the

tune is an upbeat soft-rocker with a

supberb violin fill in the place where a

guitar solo would have sufﬁced. “I Can't

Stop Loving You" is destined to be the

 

 

 

classic cut on the album; it's a soft-slow

’ Rotor ings .

of the album. A superb tune follows in
“Hightime,“ a rut in which lead guitarist
Roger Fisher, in a syncopated
counterpoint. displays some excellent
musicianship. “Straight On", already the
single, has a haunting melody with some

' guitar licks in the chorus which

y add to the tune’s impact. The tune
is a standout on the album with some very
clever lyrics set to a love theme and peat
singing by Ann and Nancy Wilson.

The title track opens the "Butterfly"
side. It is a great showcase for Ann's
softer singing potential and Nancy‘s-t
ability on 6 and 12 string acoustic guitar.
The lyrics are a little limp but the
performance more than makes up for
them. “Lighter Touch" is a classic rock
outing with a heavy downbeat in the vein
of Heart‘s primary influence; Led
Zeppelin.

"Nada One" is Nancy‘s solo vocal song;
and although it is a nice accoustic ballad,;
it is still hard to detect a difference
between her's and Ann‘s vocal styles.
“Mystral Wind". a ship on the high seas
tune, is the longest track that Heart has
yet recorded. It goes from a slow mellow
accoustic set into a veritable wall of
electric sound which again becomes
acoustic giving the listener a hint"'of
waves.

Heart has come a long way since
“Magic Man"; in a word. they‘ve
matured. Dog and Butterﬂy is an album
in which the group's creativity was not
sacrificed in order to produce a
commercially accepted (read “AM-
radio") yet disappointing album
(Jefferson Starship's Earth immediately
comes to mind). The new LP is asuccess
because it lives up to it‘s own expectations
and displays the group in their top-form.
it might just be their ﬁnest offering to
date; all the more reason why more peOple
will take Heart.

ballad nearly in the vein of “When I Need
You." “La Booga Rooga“ and “Raining
in my Heart" follow; a frantic upbeat
rocker and an adequate cover of the
Buddy Holly hit, respectively.

Side “B” is less dazzling than “A”
although it too contains some very
impressive material; particularly a great
cover of Jackson Browne‘s “Somethingl
Fine" which features some very
expressive singing by Leo with the sole
accompanyment of Lindsey Buckingham
on accoustic guitar. The only cut on the .
LP which comes short of lyricalsuccess is I
the self-penned semi-funky tune “Frankie .I
Lee." Written aboutan urban Cassanova, ‘
the overullcff‘ect is silliness. “Don‘t Look
Away“ follows; it's an upbeat rocker
which suceeds in displaying Leo's
displeasure of a love gone bad. The
closing time is yet another Leo Sayer-
Tom Snow tune entitled “No Looking
Back." it‘s a simplistic ballad which seems
to be a statement from Lco to his old
steadfast fans who might have
disapproved of his popularity in disco
music. To quote a few lines: _

This time I'll know the mover
It's not that I'm feeling bitter
I've no bitterness to .vltow

And all I'm really trying to my

Ir that I wish I'd never let you go.

Well. the original Leo Sayer is back
'with a top notch album. i

It's true though isn‘t it? As
two hard-core fans of that

But it wasn‘t always that way for us,
and probably not for many ofyou either.
Remember those days in junior high and
high school when you'd get an older kid to
buy the cheapest beer possible for you?
Didn't it taste like someone had washed
their socks and bottled the rinse water?

It was worth it though. To experience
that wonderful mixture of emotion
caused mostly by fear, a little by
excitement, and a very little by alcohol
was something to be lived for.

Everybody invented ways to get drunk
in the fastest way possible. The most
; creative kid we ever knew was Biff
O‘Reilly. His first brainstorm was to lie
upside down along the banks of the
mighty Allegheny River (a favorite party
place in Olcan NY) and literally pour the
stuff down his throat. Needless to say,
Biff spent much of his time afterwards
kneeling along the banks of the
Allegheny.

That wasn't good enough for him.
though. To prove to the world that he was
some sort of n superman, Biff punched a
small hole in the bottom of his Iron City
can. Then, with the ingenuity that can
only be inspired by u lust for drunkeness.
he tipped his head back, ripped off the
POP-lop. and the suds exploded from the
hole and down his throat.

lliffwas the first person in the world to
die from a combination ofdrowning and
whiplash.

The places where We went to get drunk

 

were certainly varied. Besides the banks

of the Allegheny, there were numerous

But things change as you get older.
(irudually a liking for thc hops concotion
develops. and it becomes something
drunk as much for the taste as for the
effect. But the stories continue.

There's all t be times in O'Hcancy's when
the pitchers were flowing like water. and
the line for the toilets looked more like the
one at the Colonial dining hall. There's
the quad parties, with the floors that feel
like fly paper and the mushy cupcts.

But most of all there‘s the social
interaction caused by beer. You might say
it acts as a lubricant. About a hundred
people experienced a prime example of
this lost weekend, at an off-campus party
in il friend‘s apartment.

If you were there, you couldn‘t have
missed this obviously drunken madman
greeting everyone who come through the
door with “Hi, how ya doin‘.’ Haven‘t seen
you in 2| long while." Well, that was Phil,
iind he didn‘t know any of the folks he
greeted. Normally he doesn't even talk to
people he knows, but that "old brew"
turned him on.

Some people may regard that as being
obnoxious, but not us. After all, who
wants to go to a party and sit there like a
lump of cloy‘.’ Have a few “frosty boys"
and enjoy yourself for heavens sake.

As good its these “college times" are
lichvcr, the old habit of drinking cheap
bccr around campfires in fields still
beckons us upstate hicks. Just once in it
while to grab a SlX-plle of Gencssec,
throw a little rowdy rock and roll on the
turntable. and dream ofthose adolescent
days; that's what we live for. '

lint usually, we‘re just as happy to Sit

mellow out with some 'l'V or music. ll)oc.s
