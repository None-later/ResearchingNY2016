_ “We're probably better prepared
than last week.“ said Aldrich. “We
never saw Kings Point play before.
so we never knew what their defense
could do against the wishbone.
We’ve seen Southern Connecticut
play last year. so we know what to
expect."

"We were sort of over conﬁdent
for Kings Point,“ said Paulo. “We
underestimated them and we weren‘t
organized as we could havebeen.

without Ed Sellen, who suffered a
leg injury against Kings Point. A:
Albany's tight end and punter. his
presence would be missed.

“Our kicking game would be
weakened if Eddiecan't play." ex-
plained Reynolds. “As far as tight
and. Eddie will be missed. but we
have Bruce (Dey) and he‘s a very
competent player."

Leading the Danes into Bleeker
Stadium for the ﬁrst time in their
history is a head coach who is op-
timistic about his team.

“I'm always confident." said Ford.
“I‘ve never felt we were going to lose
a ballgame Since we‘ve been here.”

In 0T Games

Following the opening 2-1 defeat
against San Jose St.. Albany was
ranked ninth in the state. They will
certainly fall from the rankings after
their showing in the last two out-

ings. Saturday they play the top-
ranltcd squad in New York soccer.
Oneonta.

The defense has played well.
allowing a scant four goals in three
overtime contests against quality
competition. Mark Wenzct. the
hen rded senior dcfertscman. forward
Hector Ruuito and Aguilar have all
drawn high rnrtrks from the dis-
gruntled couch for their contribu-
lion.

Arungo has continued to sparkle
lit the cage and the hooters may not
he in such disarray and chaos in the
rtcur,t'trturc. Fine showings against
lliurtwick ttnd Oneontu would lift
their spirits irt the upboming frightful
stretch, which also includes powerful
St. Francis. The next home game is
set for Sept. Jtlugrtinst a tough Cor-
tlrtiid squad.

“Then: is some frustration and
brewing on the team. I can't deny
that.“ said Schieffclin in retrospect.
"The problem is we know we‘re a
buttcuocccr team thamhis; nobodl
thought we‘d be winless after three
games. Nobody‘s giving up either,
this is still a hard Working club and
the ()rteontrt grtrnc will probably give
some good answers."
