Undefeated Netmen Romp;
Cop Win At Vermont

by Todd S. Beyer

As has occurred in their two
previous matches this season. the
Albany State tennis team soundly
beat their opponent on Tuesday. The
Danes defeated the University of
Vermont on the road. 7-2.

Danes' co-captain and ﬁrst singles
player. Paul Feldman, easily
handled Allen‘Drury, 6-0. (yo. “I
think it might have been the ﬁrst
time in my college career that [didn't
lose a game." said Feldman. “It was a
big shock to see how poor Drury
was."

In the second singles spot. Albany
co-captain Larry Linett whipped
Frank Babbott. 6—0. 6-l.“Their team
was severely hurt by graduation.

They had their four or number-ﬁve
player play me.“ said Linett. "That
still didn‘t take away from my play-
ing. I played really well Tuesday."
Third singles player Lane Lerner
of Albany won easily over Kent
Friedman, 6-0. 6-1. “I had a good
day and .played very well.“ said
Lerner. “I don‘t think my opponent
was as bad as the score indicates. He
just had a bad day."
Singles Play
In the rest of singles play. Dane
senior Mike Fertig beat Bill Hansen.
6-3. 1-6. 6-l in the fourth position.
The fifth and sixth spots were where
Vermont picked up both their vic-
tories. Gene Gillespie lost to Mark
Lompagnon. 6-3. 3-6, 6-2. and Dave

Albany coach Bob Lewis was dis-
appointed with .the competition.
"Vermont was not as strong as I an-
ticipated them to' be. I don‘t think it
was a very good test for our team.”
said Lewis. “Most of our competi-
tion is better than Vermont was."

Ill-stem Championships

The Eastern Collegiate Cham-
pionships will take place tomorrow
and Sunday at Rider College in New
Jersey. “There will be many top
Division II and Ill teams there." said
Lewis. “Last year we were tied for
lOth out of 38 teams. Paul Fcld-
man was a semi-finalist in the
number-one singles competition."

“I‘m not sure how well I‘m play-
ing.“ said Fcldman. “I don'tconsider
whui I‘ve been doing lately very com-
petitive tennis. It‘s been a big shock
how poor the last couple of teams
have been. I hope i can play well in
the upcoming competition."
