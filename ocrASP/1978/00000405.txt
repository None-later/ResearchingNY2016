.Paulo: "i‘We’reH‘oping‘For It To Happen Again”
Danes Face .Southem Conn. At Bleeker Stadium Tomorrow Night

by Paul Schwartz
‘ Last year. the Danes lost their first
game of the season. in their next out-
ing, they played Southern Connec-
ticut. Albany came out on top Iii-3,
and went on to win eight games in a
row and qualify for the NCAA
playoffs. ’

A week ago, the Danes again were
defeated in their openinggame ofthe
season. Tomorrow they face
Southern Connecticut. Beginning to
see a resemblance? When the Danes
take the ﬁeld at Bleeker Stadium.
they ‘-.'will be rooting hard for
history to repeat itself.

“That's the feeling of the team."
said Danes‘ defensive captain Kenny
Paulo. “We kind of found ourselves
in last year‘s Southern Connecticut
game. and We’re hoping for it to
happen again this year.“

last year's success against the Owls.
they will have to improve upon last
week's performance. a I” loss to
Kings Point. Of major concern is the
.Albany offensive unit, which never
really got untracked last week.

“We're better, preparui for
Southern Connecticut." said Dane
offensive coach Gary Reynolds.
“Last week we lacked total com-
munication between Ithe coaching
staff and the offensive team. We
didn't communicate well enough to
be a winner."

The Danes‘ preparation will be
needed. because the Owl's are a
football team than Kings Point." ac-
cording to Albany State head coach
Bob Ford. in their first game ofthe
season. Southern Connecticut
played well. but was out-classed
by American international College

   
  
    

Albany's Jim Dion-i boars down on the Kings Point quarterback teat Satmday. Danes‘ offense

was a “misleading score," according
to Reynolds. “AlC is a great team."

In particular. it is the Southern,
Connecticut offense that is stronger
than the Kings Point attack of last,

week. The Owls have a veteran
offensive unit that uses a pro-set;
combining _a veer attack and some
drop back pass plays. “They don't do
a lot of fancy stuf ." explained
Reynolds, who scouted southern
Connecticut last week. “About the
funniest play they run is a screen
pass. But they hurt us twice last year
with a draw play.“

Spearheading the Owl’s attack will
be senior quarterback Tom Flaherty
(6‘|". 205). Against AlC. Flaherty
threw primarily short passes while
completing ll of 16 passes for 122
yttrds and one touchdown. "He‘s a
very capable quarterback."

Boaters Fit To Be Tied After. OT Setbacks

by David Osborn

Overtime play following a
scoreless regulation session is meant
to break ties. in the case of the
Danes' soccer team. though. the ex-
tra periods may be breaking souls
‘and aspirations also.

A woozy and dejected Albany
State squad struggled back home
from Oswcgo late Wednesday night
after playing to a 0-0 overtime tie
with a school they beat 5-3 last fall.
The encounter marked the thit’d con-
secutive overtime game for the
Danes which has left them with a dis-
appointing 0—2-1 mark heading into
the sticky part of their schedule.

“The defense has been solid in all
three games we‘ve played and Dario
Arango has been superlative in the
goal." said Couch Bill Schieffelin.
"But the offense hus)just not been
able to get off track;
people out there. but so far theyjust
aren't gelling together."

Against Oswego. the Danes were
outshot 22-17 and Arango was forc-
ed to make l4 sates. The dormant
offensive thrust is owed mainly to
the midﬁelders. Schieffelin says.
They are not holding the ball for a

 

there are good ‘

certain span and then dishing off
passes to the forwards at the oppor-
tune moment.

Anytime the forwards received
passes Wednesday, they were
already blanketed by two or three
Oswego defenders. “There isn‘t any
precision give-and-go passing
developing out there. we‘re still play-
ing toward the middle a bit too much
and the forwards get little room to
operate." added Schicffelin.

Carlos Arango. a senior from
Brooklyn and brother to the keeper.
had the finest scoring opponunity in
the scoreless tie for the Danes. He
cunte down on the right side midway
through the second half and cut
between two defenders. Then.
however, with soph Robert Dahab
along on the other corner ofthe net.
he shot and the Oswego goalie was
equal.

“The forwards have been getting
the ball so infrequently in scoring
position that they seem a bit unsure
when they do ﬁnd themselves in that
situation." Schieffelin explained.
"Then people get nervous and

frustrated when the passes aren't
where they should be and we lose a

certain cohesiveness."

Runningthe ball about 60 percent
of the time. the Owls have two
dependable senior running backs to
call on. Mike Jones (5‘9". “30) was
the team‘s leading ground gainer last
year. While playing in only five
ballgames, Jones managed to run
through defenses for a total of 647
yards. “He's the guy we have to
stop," commented Reynolds. “He's
Very fast and can hurt us with some
long gains."

At the other running back slot will
be Dave Ungerer (5'8", l85). who led
the Owls last week with 43 yards on
l0 carries. Also expected to see a
good deal of action is junior Ed
Wormley (5‘9". I75). the squad‘s se-
cond leading rusher a year ago.

The receiving corps is led by
flanker Gary Hurley. who corraled
ﬁve of Flaherty's tosses for 72 yards
and one touchdown. '“They go to
him most of the time,“ said
Reynolds. The split end. Bob
Womer (5‘l0"). is a small. quick
puss-catcher.

"I‘d have to consider them an
average offensive team." explained
Reynolds. "But they have great
potential. We‘ll try to shut down the
veer rind make them run inside. Our
strength is uptbcmiddlcwith(.lohn)
Veruto and (Dave) Mathis on
defense. They are a short passing
tcu'm. so we will try to force them to
do the things they are not comfor-
table with. and that is throwing
deep."

Just like Kings Point. Southern
Connecticut uses a 5-2 monster
defense. Also similar to Kings
Point. the Owls‘ top defensive player
is their nose guard, Bob Monteiro
(6‘2". 215). Against AlC. Monteiro
pressured the quarterback all game.
and seven times came close to getting
it suck. '

“He plays a strtiight up nose
guard." said Reynolds. “He's the
type of player that doesn't do much
for a while. then gets fired up. He
comes alive and becomes a catalyst

for the defense."

Senior Mark O'Connor(6'0". 200)
plays the monster back position. and
according to Reynolds, he plays it
well. “He does a good job of art-
ticipation and he's hard nosed. We

‘ have to do things at him to make him

stay at home. and do some things
away from him where he can‘t be in
the play."

Co—captain Wayne Flenke (5‘ll".

. 210) leads the linebackers. “He‘sjust

a solid player." commented
Reynolds. “ He seems to have picked
up speed from last year."

The defensive unit is. in Reynolds
opinion, stronger than the offense.
“They're aggressive, but not as dis»
ciplined as Kings Point. We have to
take advantage of that. i think
sooner or later we can catch them
with a big play.“

After their disappointing showing
in their opener. the Danes have made
some adjustments for Southern
Connecticut. a team with a similar
grime plan its Kings Point. “We‘ll try
to he more patient on offense." said
Reynolds. “If we get stopped on it
certain play. we will try to make ud-
justments and stick with it. but we
won‘t be stubborn. We also need
riiorc passing; not in the number of
passes. but in the pass selection. We
have to do u better job than last
week."

Shuring the passing chores in the
season opener was Brad Aldrich and
Terry Walsh. Neither had a good
day. but head coach Ford has chosen
to stick with Aldrich its his starter
against the Owls. “We didn‘t plan on
jiggling quarterbacks in the first
game." said Ford. “You just can‘t do
that. because it disrupts the whole
team. We‘ve chosen Brud to start.
and we plan to stick with him
through the game."

To pick up the tempo on the
wishbone offense that managed only
two pitcbouts last week. it variation
in the Danes' blocking scheme will
be applied. The split end will attempt
more cruckback blocking to seal off
the monster buck or the linebacker.
This will allow Levi Lewis. Jack
Burger and Bruce Churchwell more
room to turn the corner and es—

Feldman Vetoes Golf Team Funds

by Jill Haber

SA President Paul Feldman's veto
of the golf team's budget request has
resulted in the seven member team
being cut after it had already played
a match.

Feldman said that there were
many factors considered in his deci-
sion to veto the appropriation in-
cludingthe verytigbt athletic depart-
ment budget. “The athletic finances
situation is not going to get better.“
he said.

"Golf was the fifth sport to be es-
tablished its a varsity club on campus
- in the full of ‘59.“ said Golf Coach
Dick Stillch . “It was the first team
on campus ever to go to the
NCAA‘s.“

'l'hc athletic budget is prepared in
the spring by the Athletic Fintincc
Committee (AFC) of Central Coun-
cil. It is then voted on by Central
Council and fimtlly approved by the
SA President.

Originally, a budget of $2300 for
golf was submitted in the spring and
the entire amount was trimmed front
the budget. according to Suiters.

Over the summer. it was found
that ii surplus of about $3.360 was
left in the athletic budget. according
to Feldnian. Sauers said he pruned
the budget to $906 over the summer

The revised 8906 budget was sub-

Suucrs said he held tryoutsand
went ahead with the team because he
felt he had a back up system of fun-
ding in the use of appeal letters to
golf team alumni. However. Suuers
said that Athletic Director Bob Ford
thought this would set it ncgutivc
precedent and Situcrs refrained froin
mailing the letters on Ford‘s
recommendation.

According to AFC conrinittcc

seven to two in favor of funding the
team. ’l‘obuck said he voted for it.
The AFC is composed of eight
voting students rind four voting
