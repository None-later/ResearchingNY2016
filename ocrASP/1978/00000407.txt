Drums

continued from page three

“We notiﬁed all of the RA's on in-
dian Quad to look out for them,"
said Duncan. .

Duncan said that she believes the
drums were stoled by "someone who
knew that we were going to leave
them there overnight, and who knew
that they could get in the Campus
Center before us."

The Campus Center doesn't open
until lZnoon Sundays. but the doors

ere open because of Parent's

eekend Brunch which was being
held in the Campus Center
Ballroom.

Hyncs said that the doors of
the Rathskeilar, which , doesn't
open until 2 pm. on Sundays, were
locked and that he didn't know how
anyone could have gained entrance.
Hynes gave discriptions of the

   

  

  

people he saw to University Police.
According to Henighan. University.

Police have not had a follow-up

yet after talking to the witness
and band members.

Duncan' said that the drums,
which are Siingerlands brand name,
with a Ludwig brand snare drum, are
valued at over $600.

“Whoever took them speciﬁcally
wanted drums and not the amps,
which are worth about the same and
are easier to carry." .

“Hynes said that the band had
been informed that there was a
storage area by Arnold. and that
the Rathskellar was not responsible
for the stolen equipment.

“1 don‘t remember him saying
that," said band member Bob Gar-
dner, who signed a contract to per-
form in the Rat. “Maybe they
ﬁgured it was implied. but i don‘t
recall them specifically telling us
that."

Hynes said that this was the first

time equipment has been stolen from

..the Rah; ~ " 1 ~-

The band Conscious played the
Rnthskellar Thursday, Friday; and
Saturday nights. “it's amazing that
something like this happened." said
Duncan. “it‘s hard to believe."

A reward is being - offered to
anyone with any information
leading to the arrest of whomever
sl ole the drums. Anyone with any in-
formation should contact the ASPat
457-2l90 as well as University

Unions Clash

continued from page am-
the letter, September l5th. they
mailed out to all l6.000 of our
members letters claiming that we
had failed to respond to their
proposal."

Hartman refused to comment on
whether or not UUP would accept
the proposal.

in the meantime, the election has

been postpinedﬁdue tethefaiiureof

the' state 9%? of Employee
Relations (OER) .to supply
PERB with needed information on
certain employees‘ status, according
to both Rosenblatt and Hartman.
Currently. SUNY employees are
represented as a single unit.
However, the Committee for interns
and Residents (CIR), which

- represents some 600 state employees

in health-related fields, in conjunc-
tion with a third union, the
Physicians National Houstaff
Association. petitioned PERB to
have the SUNY health-related
employees dealt with seperately.
To further confound matters. ac-
cording to UUP spokesman John
Milton, the OER has raised doubts
as to whether or not those—CLR
members should be considered
employees at all. OER holds that. in—
usmuch as they are. for the most

part, interns, residents, and med

, 3‘3 

students, they should’b‘e' given stu-

dent status.

‘ According to Hartman, a meeting
which was to have been held last Fri-
day to settle the issue was postponed
because OER could not produce in~
formation relevent to the employee
status question.

“Right now we‘re just waiting for
the lists," said Hartman. “it is my un-
derstanding that there was some
problem in compiling them due to
the‘ fact that many CIR members
change their payroll outlets fre-
quently; such as an intern working at
a VA hospital for a few months, then
at another hospital and so forth."

OER spokespersons could not be
reached for comment.

“We‘re hoping to have another
date set this week." said Hartman.
