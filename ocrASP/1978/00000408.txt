. THE HAPPY COOKER

Men are ﬂocking to the kitchen
and putting on aprons in record
numbers.

The Christian Science Monitor
reports that cooking schools around
the country are being ﬂooded with
men who are interested in what used
to be considered a “womanly” art.

The Monitor quotes Anne Marie
.Hustc, a New York cooking school
teacher, as saying that men are get-
ting into cooking as a hobby, much
like golf or sailing, and that they are
often willing to spend lots of time
and money on it.

Hustc reports that men. more so
than women. are “fascinated with
appliances and usually want the very
best," when they cook.

The newspaper says most
observers are crediting the male
cooking phenomenon to the
women's liberation movement and
to other social changes.

VITAL VITAMIN

Vitamin C may do more than pre-
vent llu and colds.

Researcher .Iohn Weisburger of
the American Health Foundation
reports that Vitamin C in the

American diet may explain why
there is a lower incidence of stomach
cancer in the United States than
there is in Japan.

Weisburger reports that the high
levels of stomach cancers in Japan
have been, linked to large concen-
trations of nitritcs found in mackerel
and other smoked fish eaten as a
staple in Japan.

The researcher reports. however,
that laboratory studies have shown
that doses of Vitamin C to offset the
formation of cancer-causing agents
and to retard the formation of
cancerous malignancies.

Weisburgcr says that the decline in
stomach cancer in the United States
during the last 40 years is probably
due to the increasingconsumption of
foods that contain Vitamin C. par-
ticularly leafy vegtables.

He reports that Japanese who
emigrate to the United States and
begin eating an American style dict
have the same low risk of stomach
cancer that most U.S. residents do.

JAGGER SINGLE?

Parade magazine reports that
Mick Jagger is considering an offer
of nearly $2 million to appear just
once in concert by himself without
the Rolling Stones.

The magazine says the offer has
been made by promoter Robert
Stigwood. and that, if Mick accepts,
the concert would be shown around
the world on closed-circuit TV.

SPACEY ADVICE

A US. State Department official
is suggesting that an international
panel of scientists and experts from
other fields should be set up to
prepare humans for contact with
extra-terrestrial intelligences.

Michael Michaud. a Deputy
Director of the State Department's
Office of International Security
Policy, stresses that he is speaking as
a private researcher. not as an of-
ticial government representative.

Miehaud says that with powerful
radio waves emanating from the

COMPUTER SHRINK

Computers may be better at spot-
ting potential suicides than are high-
ly trained psychiatrists.

Tests at the University of Wiscon-
sin Medical School compared the
predictions made by a computer
with those ofstaff therapists after 72
scvcrely depressed patients were in-
terviewed by both.

The computer correctly identified
tlic.thrcc patients who attempted
suicide within 48 hours of the inter-
views while the psychiatrists failed to

     
       
     
       
   
   
   
     
   
   
      
 
 
 
 
     

    

  

   
   

     

‘: predict any of thmtempu.

.One patient was about to be
released when the computer deter-
mined that he had a gun, bullets and
a precise suicide plan.

Computers reportedly can make
; better shrinks because it‘s easier for
lmany humans to level with a
i machine. The Wisconsin researchers

lfound that many patients could not
tell their deepest secrets and fears to
' another person face-to-face.
' However, the patients would confess
these same secrets to a computer by
punching them into a keyboard in
response to personal questions asked
by the machine.
opposmss

A new study at New York's
Hot'stra University indicates that
when it comes to persons of the op-
positc sex, opposites do attract. ‘

Psychologist Harold Siegel
reports that he hired a student-actor
to pretend to be a different kind of
male personality while in the
presence of various female
voluntccrs.

Wllll some women, the actor came
on as being dominant or indepen-
dent: with others, he pretended to be
submissive or dependent.

Siegel asked the women to rate the
limit they had met. and then followed
this by giving personality tests to the
female volunteers. It turned out that
the women who saw the nTun as be-
Ing opposite them, such as being
dependent while they wcrc indepen-
dent. liked the actor better than it he
were similar to them.

Sicgcl reports that, in general, the
less aggressive type man was liked
thc best.

Medical Association is warning that
