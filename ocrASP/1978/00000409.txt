" estless.” An image of
curiosity, adventure.
“wanderlust. But translated
into the Dutch word “Onrust.”
the word takes on a tangible
form. because “Onrust” is the name ofa 55
foot steel huIIed lobster vessel outﬁtted
for aquatic research by the Marine
Sciences Research Center at SUNY
Stony Brook.

True to its name, the “Onrust” has left
its home port at Long Island and
ventured up the Hudson on a two week
cruise. so that members of SUNY
institutions could try out the ship‘s

    

research facilities. The last stop ofthe trip
was a layover at the Port of Albany on
Sunday. complete with an “open house"
on board if one could only make it down
the steepgangplank which let t0“0nrust‘s
deck.

Professor Peter Weyl from the Marine
Sciences Center showed off the vessel
with its complete weather station and two
radar systems. “It‘s basically a ﬂoating
laboratory and people can bring on extra
equipment," he said.

One of the research projects where the
"Onrust" is involved is checking to see if
s quher pollutants taken from coalcan be
made into ecologically safe ﬁshing reefs in

the New York City area. Another is
determining the effect that sand miningin
New York Harbor is having 'on the
ecological balance.

Although most of the ship's trips are
made in a single day. the “Onrust” can
accomodate eight scientists on board for
up to three days. who sleep in quadruple
stacked bunks and eat meals prepared in
the vessel‘s tiny galley. SUNYA biology
professor Raymond Stress took
advantage of the Albany layover to take
volunteers from his aquatic ecology class
on a four hour trip Saturday. They
studied the Iooplankton and the density
of microscopic organisms inthe Hudson.
“It‘s a lovely ship very well equipped-—
and the crew was very accomodating.“ he
said. StroSs is planninga follow uptrip in
early November for his entire class at the
Research Center on Long Island.

Captain of the craft is Helmut Stuehe,
who also oversaw the “0nrust‘s”
construction in 1974 at a builderin Rhode
Island. “I got this thing offthe ground. I

had complete control over the project."
Now. Stucbe‘s full time occupation is
piloting the ship. and although he said
he's never had any trouble withthe vessel.
he stressed that good weather was a major
factor in taking any trip.. “Wejust cancel
if it gets too rough," he said.

Stucbe had a hand in christening the
ship with the name “Onrust.” The first
“Ontust” was built in I614 by a Dutch
trader who had become stranded on
lower Manhattan Island. After her first
trip into the New York Bay in April. the
“()nrust" explored the waters of Long
Island Sound. the East River. and the
Connecticut River. It was onthe basis of
this voyage that the Dutch laid claim to
Long Island and Connecticut.

But the modern day “Onrust” will
complete her maiden voyage on the
Hudson soon and return to her home port
for more routine trips around Long
Island. confining the "restless" part of her
name to the continual search for
knowledge of the aquatic.
