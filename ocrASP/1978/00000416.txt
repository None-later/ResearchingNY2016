by MJ. Memmott ).

He is a dreamer like most
American men of his age, who long
to throw that tbuchdown pass or to
score that winning goal. But unlike
his peers. George Plimpton has
gotten the chance to live out the
American dream. and on Saturday
night he visited the SUNYA gym to
talk about it.

A tall. thin. silver-gray haired man
with a distinct Harvard accent.
Plimpton seems more like an Assis-
tant Professor of English than
someone who once quarterbacked
the Detroit Lions,through four plays
in a pro-season game against
Baltimore. He deﬁnes himself as a
“participatory journalist."

Certainly best known for his book
Paper Lion. Plimpton chose not to
concentrate on it during his hour-
and-a-half presentation. Instead. he
recapped all of his "participatory"
experiences. and then fielded
questions from the audience on a
wide variety ofissucs. most of them
related to sports.

But what showed through both
during his talk and when he relaxed
afterwards was l’limpton‘s humor
and good-natured attitude about
himself.

There was the time he fought then
light-heavyweight champion Archie
Moore. “I suffer from what you‘d
calla sympathetic response." I’limp-
ton said. “When l get hit I weep.
After one shot to my rtose lended up
both bleeding and weeping with
Moore wltispcring itt my ear to
'Breathe man. brcathc.‘ "

Or when he was with the lloston
('eltics arid it was late in the game
with the team far behind. Coach
Iiill Russell took out John l'lavlicck
and pttt l’limpton in for“seasoning."

 Plimpton Does What Others Dream

The Celtics responded by pulling to
within three points with just seconds
remaining, and Russell put Havlieek
back in for Plimpton-The Celtics
lost the game.

“I told Russell later that he'd made
a great tactical error." Plimptonjok~
ed.
He even played goalie for the
Boston Bruins against the
Philadelphia Flyers. "The Flyers
took six shots in live minutes and
only scored once." Plimpton said.
“But it wasn‘t a question of my stop-
ping them. it was more like they hit
my body."

The question that comes to most
people's minds when they hear of
I’limpton and his exploits though. is
why does he do it? Is it the thrill of
being able to live out dreams such as
pitching in Yankee Stadium. or play-
ing golf with Arnold Palmer? Cer-
tainly the living out of life-long fan-
tasies enters into it. but for Plimpton
it goes beyond that.

“I want to learn about the locker
rooms and the fraternity ot‘atheletes.
the myths and the practical jokes.
Anyone can see how the game
operates. but I'm looking for what's
behind the scenes." l’limpton said
afterwards.

He would never leave writing for
sports. though. no matter Itow
successful he became. “Sports is such
a limited career. after eight or nine
years you‘re done and you haven't
advanced in the use ofyour brains."
he said.

the use of his own brains will be
l’limpton's next challenge. “I'd like
to get into the Incntal sports next."
he said. Ile‘ll do it by playing the
next grand master itt chess.

lliough his talk was witty and full
of stories about celebrities such as

.1

Muhammad All, the questions
Plimpton faced from the audience
were often on much more serious
matters. and he showed his
knowledge‘ about sports in his
answers. ‘

'He feels that the resurgence of
baseball after a lull during the 60‘s. is
because of a nation-wide attitude
change. “Football is a mechanical
and militaristic game ofthe 20th cen-
tury. At the end of the 60‘s there was
a move away from such feelings.
And baseball. which is largely a I9th
century game. came back."

On violence in sports. he termed
those that cause it as “fringe groups."
While regrettable. Plimpton sees
violence as inevitable.

‘IDidn’tMind Waiting

by Paul Schwartz

 

 

 

 

 

Usually I despise waiting in line. but last Saturday night I didn‘t mind at
all. In front of Blceker Stadium a large crowd surrounded a narrow entrance
gate. while a line stretching Out for half a block was getting longer by the
minute.

Inside. the Danes were getting set to kick off to Southern Connecticut. It
was the first home football night game ever played by Albany, and at gamcs'
end. it was not only the lights that were shining.

The Danesgwon 28-l2. but we've almost come to expect as much. Albany's
football team just doesn‘t lose that often. No. the realsurprise wasthe stands.
They were honest-to-goodness. novdoubt-about-it FILLED. The announced
attendance was 4200, but it seemed like, felt like more.

Many local residents were there. wanting to get a glimpse of the most
successful football team around. And it was Parent‘s Weekend. so a number
of Mommies and Daddies found their way to Bleeker. But the key. the niost
impressive group was the students. They were there; man were they there.

It was a great thing to see. People were concerned where Bleeker Stadium
was. Other people were annoyed that they might miss kickoff because the
buses Were late. But at the game.there was nothing but excitment. The Danes
came throughas usual. and.at least for one night. the fans alsocaincthrough.

s it

It was a banner weekend all around for Albany sports. Before the
excitement at the football game had even started. thesocccr team had defeated
Oneonta l-0.

What‘s so great about that? OK. you asked. Oneonta happensto be ranked
first in the state, and film in the entire nation. No Division I. II. or III
nonsense. Thirteenth in the whole country! That is. until they played Albany.

Wait. there‘s more. The tennis team competed in the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Association Championships. Out of 39 teams. Albany placed
second. Second? Albany? You know it.

Two players on the team. Paul Feldman and Larry Linett. advanced allthc
way to the singles finals before beittg beaten. Add this to the fact that
Albany's varsity baseball team swept a doubleheader frotn North Adams
State 8-5. 4-l . and it comes out as quite a weekend. As good as most schools.
attd better than most. Albany State Sports. A thrill a Ininttte. Well. at least
four in one Weekend.

IN THE CHMPUS CENTER

Army, Syracuse Outrun Harriers

by Jeff Carone
The Albany State varsity cross

country team learned the hard way

just how big a difference there can be
between a Division land Division II
school. The Iessoncame Saturday. in
Syracuse. at the hands of the
Orangemen and the Cadets of West
Point.

When the dust cleared. it was
Army IS. Albany 49 and Syracuse
19. Albany 40. Army defeated
Syracuse. l9-4l. to win the meet.

The Cadets were by far the best
team. Led by John Enright. who
triumphed in 26:49. they took six
of the top seven spots. Charlie
Bevier of Syracuse came in second
place to prevent an Army sweep.

The top Albany State runner was
John Little. who finished ninth
overall. Rounding out the top five
lortlte Danes were Scan Reilly. l4th.
co-caplain Mark l.avan. Intlt.junior
‘ransfcr .lack Russo in mm and
freshman llruce Shapiro in 22nd
place.

The results. however. cart he
deceptive as to the barriers perfor-
mance. The Albany team ran well.

but simply came up against a good
Syracuse team and an overpowering
Army squad. “It was a quality
meet." said Danes‘ coach Bob
Munsey. “I don‘t think the guys are
dOWn.“ ‘

Evidence for this can be seen in the
times that were recorded. Enright‘s
time was the second fastest ever run
on the tough Syracuse course and
only nine seconds off the course
record. The first five marks were all
within the top 35 ever run on the
course.

This leads to two questions: Why r
run against such superior teams?
Why not schedule easy teams? The
answer to this. according to Munsey.
is that the team is looking to im-
prove and it does not improve much
against weak competition. "You
don‘t improve unless you go against
tough runners.“ said Munsey.

The facts. however. can be a little
misleading aslothe actuuldifference
between the Albany runners and the
other two squads. The Army team
although always strong. seems to be
exceptional this year. Munscy said.
“It was the best Arntv team we ever

ran against." That statement
stretches over seven yean'of com- '
petition against the Cadets.

The Syracuse score indicates a real

‘ trouncing also. but that was not the

ictual case. according to Munsey.
Although the Orangemen won
soundly, the coach pointed out thata
few seconds difference at some
positions may have resulted in a
different outcome. Munse'y had no
excuses, however. “We met most-
ly superior teams, what more can I
say?"

The Danes are looking forward
to two big upcoming meets. The ﬁrst
is Saturday. at 12:30 pm. against

. Williams. Albany‘s opponents have
: beaten them the past three years.but
had better not come in over conﬁ-

dent. Munsey says. He hopes for his

"squad to reverse the trend.

The following Saturday. Colgate
is the competition. A tremendous
rivalry has built up between the
Albany runners and those of
Colgate. This rivalry will be inten-
sified. as the series record between
the two squads is deadlocked at live
\vins each.

The offensive captain also com-

20-yard connection with Ed Sellers.

run for the Danes' final score.

When the game started. the Owls
looked impressive. They took the

straight down the field. Flaherty
threw three fine passes and ran
successfully from the pro set. leading
So. Conn. down to Albany's six-
yartl line where the Owls opted to go
on a fourth-down play.

would ttttt inside to make the yar-

Albany took over and it \vasjust a

spearheaded a IZ-play 57-yard drive

his way over front the six. (inry tier-
man‘s kick put the Danes on top to

"Last week it wasjust a lotul'little
things that went wrong on offense.“
said Aldrich. “The pitcltcs didn't
quite work. the litte was a hit offand
we never got together. l‘onight we
were crisp from the very ‘ u. ’
and we ran partiettlarly strong up the
middle.“

So. Conn. was led by senior run-
ning hack Mike Jones who topped

Dave llngerer blocked a punt on the
Danes‘ 2] and ran it in for another
score late in the final quarter. with

Aside from that. a swnnning Dane
defense throttled So. Conn. and
limited their Division II opponents
to a mere fi‘) yards on the ground.

life only shabby side of the
squad‘s performance came on
penalties. lhey stifled a few poten-
tial drives and a score with inoppor-
lutte infractions. adding up to If)

the Danes are now l-I two weeks
into the season; the satire precarious
spot they found themselves at this
little last year. In ‘77. an Iii—.l victory .

o\er tltc Owls after an opening loss
proved a catalyst that eventually led
to a 9-2 mark and the most celebrated
season in Alhttrty football history.
“This is a veteran team and we
knew this would he a very big game
for us.“ l’aulo said. "It‘s hard to say
ltow this team would stack up
against last year's: every year and
every learn is distinct. But we know
we have to Will the rest of our games
to equal their record. and we should
know soon ifthis is that kind ofteam.“
