Industry vs. “ cancer Safeguards

(PNS)Can laboratory tests on‘mice
and rats prove that a substance
causes cancer in humans?

How much of aknown carcinogen
(cancer-causing substance) can
humans be safely exposed to in their
work? , «
How is the government to regulate

more than I,500 substances

suspected of causing human cancers,
but for which it has no deﬁnitive

Are most cancers enviornmentally
related?

These and other issues surroun-
ding the causes and detection of
cancer will be the subject of intense

cupational Safety and Health Ad-

protracted hearings on its new
proposal to regulate toxic sub-

Cancer experts and scientists form
over the world are expected to testify
at the hearings. which could last
more than three months.

The proposed rules would ban or
severely restrict the use of hundreds
of chemicals currently used in in-.

t of Housing and Urban
Iopment is shutting down its
trous “new towns" program.
ng an end to a "sad, painfuland
‘nsivc" effort to build innovative
cw communities throughout the
nation.
The New Communities effort is
.1 one of the best publicized failures of
r ‘II‘ federal urban programs. One of-
 is], declining to be identified, said
tits reputation was so low that "we
{didn‘t want to tarnish the urban
 policy“ with a new towns initiative.

1 Losses in the eight-year New
:.Communities program now total
‘$i49 million, and the Office of
' Management and Budget has refus-
ed to release planning funds to revive

the program.

Thus, this week, HUD Secretary
Patricia Roberts Ham's approved
staff recommendations to end the
new towns effort. And she will ask
Congress to close down HUD‘s New
Communities Corp., shifting its
duties elsewhere within the depart-
ment.

Mrs. Harris said HUI) plans to Ii-
quidatc seven of the I] new town
projects it subsidizes, while commit-
ting additionul money to six towns

A moratorium on subsidizing new
projects has been ineffcct since I975
while HUD worked to untangle the
financial problems plaguing prllc-
ticaily all of the existing efforts.

The department will try to sell off__

most of the seven projects it is li-‘
quiduting.‘ These projects are in

Jonathon, Minn., perhaps the best
known of the new towns, as well as
Park Forest South in Chicago;
Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis,
Flower Mound near Dallas, Texas,
Riverton and Gananda near
Rochester. N.Y., and Newfields,
near Dayton Ohio.

Towns that will recieve fulture
housing grants, its well as comminity
development grants, include Soul

tiwuy suburb of Washingotn D.C.;

The secretary had hoped to
salvage the New Communities Corp.
by redirecting its efforts to concen—
trate on inner-city, rather than sub-
urban or ruralI projects.

that there is an interest in changing

the policy. This means that we are

going to keep abreast of it."
Committee member Hugh Hill

. said ihut SA might take a course

aimed at better educating the
students on the issue. He explained
that many respondents to the
questionaire failed to read
explanatory paragraphs outlining
the issue printed on the form itself.

“Since the students are so divided
on the issue, we cannot decide
whether to oppose or advocate plus-
minus grading,“ he said. “For that
reason we may try to make the
students more familiar with thc'suh-
jeet.“

Hill said that such education
might include mention in the campus
media, on—campus discussion and
risking those pro and con to “take
poi-shots at each other."

State quad freshman Wendy Curtis
said that she was opposed to plus-
minus grading because she is
“against anything thllt creates more
competition in the classroom.
There's enough nit-picking about
grades already without glvnlg
everyone more distinctions to argue
about."

Senior Debbie Hiiatt disagrees.
“It would work out much better for
the students in that it borderline case
