The industry council recently filed

challenged some of the basic
assumptions behind the new rules.
The industry group, for example.
maintained that industrial chemicals
only represent a small fraction ofthe
enviornmcntal causes of cancer.

It argued that “pandemic cigarette

told reporters late Wednesday after
meeting for two hours and 20
minutes with Soviet Foreign
'Minister Andrei A, _Gromyko. “I
believe it is possible that we can
reach a treaty this year."

Vance declined to say whether~

Gromyko’s outline of the. latest
Soviet negotiating position offered

between the two governments.

cancers are removed from the
national figures, the cancer rate
would actually be shown to be in the
decline.

The council further contended
that it would be far less costly for
Congress to supply OSHA with ad-
ditional manpower to continue tis
case-by-case review than to impose
sweeping standards on industry.

There is little doubt that industry
expects the new rule. if adopted, to
be costly. That apparently is why it
has funded the council with a million
dollar budget. '

At last one labor leader, Anthony
Mazzocchi. vice president ofthe Oil.

denounced the idea of coldly com-
puting the additional costs involved
in safeguarding employee health as
“calculated murder.“

Another session was scheduled to-

Nations. They will meet Saturday in

‘ Gromyko on Wednesday gave the
Soviet response to the most recent
U.S. proposals carried to the
Kremlin earlier this month by Paul
C. Warnke. the chief U.S. nrms
negotiator. There was no indication
how the Russians responded.

On the thorny issue ofmodcrnim-
tion of missile systems, the United
States proposed that the two coun-
tries cach be permitted to introduce
one new land~based missile system
and one new submarine-launched
missile.

To resolve the dispute over
whether the new Soviet Backfire
bomber should be included among
the long-range weapons limited by
the treaty, the United States is asking Y
