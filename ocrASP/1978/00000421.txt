Carter Assures  East Treaty.

WASHINGTON (AP) President
Carter, holding his ﬁrst nationally
televised news conference since the
conclusion of the historic Camp
David summit, said Thursday he has
been assured there are no remaining
obstacles to a pence treaty between
Israel and Egypt.

Carter announced that Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
brought together on foreign soil for
the marathon 13-day summit. ad-
vised him they will begin treaty talks
in about two weeks. adding that the
United States will be a “full partner."

The impetus for the latest Middle
East peace development. Carter
said. was the Israeli Knesset‘s
“courageous” action in approving
withdriiwal of Jewish settlements
from the Sinai in return fora treaty-
tt prime ingredient in the Camp
David accord.

The president said the assurances
came from Sadat and Begin follow-
ing the action by the Israeli parlia-
lllL‘llI.

Carter said that while the United
States will be fully involved in the
negotiations. he personally will re-
main on the sidelines.

Carter said he did not anticipate
this because the issues remaining to
be settled are relatively non-
controversial.

Carter alsocalled for an all-parties
conference on the situation in
Lebanon. which has been racked by
months of civil war.

“There's a tragedy in Lebanon
that the rest ofthe world has not ade-

Jately addressed," he said. The
president said he does not favor par-
titioning of the strife-tom nation but
suggested negotiations toward
“some solution that might involve a
new charter“ for the government.

On another matter, Carter ex-
pressed confidence that negotiations
on a new strategic arms limitation
treaty between the United States and
the Soviet Untion are proceeding
well.

"We hope to conclude a SALT
agreement this year.“ said the presi-

dent, who will personally take
charge of the American negotiating
team on Saturday when the talks are
scheduled to move to Washington.
Turning io domestic issues, Carter
said he has issued an order setting up
an emergency board to send striking
railroad clerks back to work.

He said both sides in the dispute
between the Norfolk dz Western
Railway and Airline Clerks, which
has caused thousands of layoffs and
paralyzed rail lines in 42 states, want
to reach an accord and are close to
an agreement. .

Carter also attacked what he
called "wasteful" spending bills, and
said the $l0.2 billion public works
measure which cleared Congress
Wednesday is “completely unaccep-

table."

Although he stopped short of say-
ing he would veto the bill. Carter left
little doubt that he woulddo so. And
the president’said he was not in-
timidated by predictions that some
House members would -be so
angered by a veto that they would
vote against a natural~gas bill in
retaliation.

“I'm willing to meet the Congress
on this issue." he said.

Carey Pays for State Plane

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) Gov. Hugh
Carey‘s campaign organization has
paid the state treasury $50,000 to
cover the cost of using a state plane
in his campaign. the Department of
Taxation and Finance announced
Thursday.

And the Friends of Governor
Carey Committee said that if that
fund proved insufficient to cover the
full cost of the use of the state cam-
pttign, it would make up the

| difference.

The governor has proposed that
after the Nov. 7clcctiona team ofin-
dependent auditors be named to
check all the flights he has made dur-
ing the campaign season and bill his
committee for their cost.

The department, however, did not
specifically accept that procedure
nor propose another of its own. It
simply said the $3.000 would be held
in a bank until there was some future
determination of how much Carey‘s
apparatus would be billed,

Republican gubernatorial can-

 

MARIO ANDRETTI

didatc Perry Duryea has attacked
Carey for using state planes in cam-
paign travels. And without
providing any speciﬁc basis for his
figures. Duryea has asserted that the
political use ofthe plane has cost the
taxpayers "at least $|00,000."

Carey, however, has said that he
will continue to use the state plane,
in part of "security" reasons and in
part because it has an nir-to-ground
telephone and other facilities which
enable him to continue his work as
governor while in transit.

Carey campaign aides have
acknowledged that even if the full
cost ot ustng the plane is reimbursed
to the state. the incumbent‘s ability
to make use of it gives hima political
advantage.

The ready availability of the plane

spares his campaign committee the
administrative trouble of making
charter arrangements for each ﬂight
; on private planes - something
3 l)uryea has to do. And the per-hour
charge for use of the state plane is
likely to be lower than the rates of
profit-making air charter services,
other things being equal.
