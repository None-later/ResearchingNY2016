THREE CHEERS

Three would-be cheerleaders. all
of them male, have ﬁled a sex dis-

crimination complaint against the Los
Angeles Rams for not being allowed

among the 800 women who tried out

for cheerleading jobs with the foot-
ball team last April.

All three men say they have ﬁled
complaints with the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission in
California after the Rams never
responded to their applications to
lead cheers for the football team.

The three, who are being
represented by National Organiza-
tion for Women Attorney Gloria
Allred. say their sex-bias complaint
is the ﬁrst step toward a sex dis-
crimination suit they plan to file
against the football team.

The three said they Werei“cl
welcome at the try-outs which urged
potential cheerleaders to come dress-
ed “as sexy as you feelcomfortablc."

WOMAN'S WORK

Elizabeth Koontz. head of the
National Commission on Working
Women, is contending that if women
did not go to work for just a few
days, the society would “fall on its
face."

Koontz told a recent conference
that working women do not fare well
in the U.S. She claims that 80 per—
cent of all working women are in
lower-paying, lower—status jobs; that
two out of every three adults living in
pov; ‘ty in the U.S. are women; and
that the 1976 median annual ear-

nings of full-time women workers

were a mere 60 percent of the ear-

nings of their male counterparts.
Koontz suggests that women may

DREAM ON '

A Penn State psychologist claims
that daydreaming is good for you.

Doctor Philip Taylor says that
most people who let themselves
daydream are generally refreshed.
stimulated and renewod when they
come back to what theywere'doing.

Another benefit of daydreaming,
according to Taylor. is that it allows
people to sort things out in their
mind. He says many people work out
solutions to problems while their

 
 
 
 

thoughts are drifting in daydream.

Taylor claims that many parents
commit an error when they interrupt
a child‘s daydreams. He says
children should be encouraged to
daydream. as long as it doesn't in-
terfere with their responsibilities.

The Professor warns that there is
one kind of person who should avoid
daydreams: those who have
"obsessional fears." This type of per-
son should seek professional help,
Taylor says.

' POISON SHAKE

A Rhode island pharmacist says
he may have developed an antidote
for poison that tastes just like a
:hocolate milkshake.

According to Christopher

Rhodes. the nitriture contains water
droplets ’laced 'with‘, chemicals and
oils which will latch‘on to the poison.
preventing it from getting into the
blood stream.

Currently poison antidotes consist

of gritty activated charcoal mixed .
with water. Rhodes says that a small
child is much more likely to down a
milkshakelike substance than the
charcoal grit.

Farsaee FAME '

Frisbee lovers rejoice. That

famous flying disc you all know and
love so well has made it to the.
hallowed halls of the Smithsonian.

The National Air and Space

Museum has announced that the‘,
frisbee will be displayed in a new
gallery devoted to what it‘ calls
Flight-For-The-The-Heck-Of-II.

The Museum says that the entire

history of the saucer-like disc will be
preserved for history. included in the
exhibit is the first unshined [0-inch
metal pie tin from the now—defunct

Frisbic I’ic Company in Bridgeport,

Connecticut, originally used by Yale

University students. and the more
sophisticated plastic, curved-lip
models used today.

Acting Museum Director Melvin
Zisl'cin says the frisbcc hnscarncd its
place in the Smithsonian “because
the new gallery is supposed to bring
all oi us the things we personally can
do with flight for our amusement."
Besides, he says. “it's fun.“

RUDE NUDES
A University of California
Sociology Professor, after makinga
study of the subject. says that nude
beaches are not good places to pick
\vontcn up.

According to Human [Iv/mviur
Magiwinc. the Professor found that
pickups are actually easier on cloth-
cd beaches.

According to his findings. both
women and men go to the nude
benches because they like to sun in
the buff. . .and for no other reasons.
Women at nude bcuchcs who were
interviewed stated they found it in-
sulting that men would assume that
just because they \verc without
clothes they were artsy pickups.

truck, he commandeered in auto

ducd by police.
