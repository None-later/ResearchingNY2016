SUNYA. a bunch ofsagacious

This rumor. however is totally
unfounded. Copy does not appear
magically and so, in order to provide the
U niversity community with something to
wrap their fish in. we the editors. must
rely on reporters. This makes being an
editor a pretty tough job.

At about two o‘clock this afternoon the
clanging phone roused me from a blissful
sleep. Reluctantly leaving Al Pacino‘s
arms. 1 stumbled over to the accursed
object which was ringing mercilessly off
of my wall. wading through stacks of
unedited copy and last week‘s beer. Half-
concious. I pick up the receiver and am
greeted by a scratchy whining. inhuman
voice. My fears were not unfounded: it is
a reporter.

I answer with a calm “What the fuck
are you calling about now?" I‘m
beginning to feel the effects of last night‘s
Singapore Slings and am not exactly
titillated by the fact that I've been ripped
untimely frotn my bed.

Somehow my adroit reporter senses
this.

ou don‘t have to be lris'h to
drink at the Washington
Tavern. but if you are. you
may feel particularly at home
there. WT's is one of the few
drinking spots in the area that has any
kind ofethnic identity, and though it‘s not
obvious enough or overemphasized
enough to make you feel uncomfortable if
.you don't happen to be of Celtic Stock, it
is subtly communicated that if you are.
then this bar is where you belong.

l don't know if WT‘s started out as an
“lrish Bar". or whether it progessively
.became one as more of the area's local
Hibernians started hanging outthere, bur
this chicken—«or—the—egg reasoning
isn't very important anyway. It‘s a fact
that the bar, through its decor, the booze
it serves, and the people who frequent the
place. conveys a distinctly lrish flavor.

The walls are ltung with old ceramic
“jugs-o‘-punch," hurling sticks.
advertisements for Tullamore‘s Dew.
Players. and Guiness stout. and of course
an lrish flag. On tap they‘ve got Matt's.
Harp. and Guincss, and the stout is served
in pint glasses, not mugs. A bartender
named Liam Murphy 1 once sang and
drank with told me an old proverb to
explain why he served stout in glasses and
ttot mugs: “If you‘re too drunk to hold
onto your beer without a handle, you‘re
too drunk to drink in here." There‘s also a
lot of bottles on the old mirrored
backbar, and a good percentage of them
hold whiskey, including a number of fine
lrish imports.

There‘s not too much wine here
though. just standard jug wines and a few
of the more popular German ones. When
I mentioned this to the ruddy-faced gent

doing a tidy job ﬁnishing offone ofa long

succession of warm Guiness pints. he i

explained, with just a hint of a brogue.
that “it‘s a drinkin‘ bar, man not a bloody
wine emporium.“ .
And. for the number ofweeknights l‘ve
spent with bent elbow in WTs. l have
always been surprised at the high
percentage of lrish—looking types

around me. Some faces just had the -

characteristic foreheads. noses. chins and
freckles. and there was just no mistaking

them, Others dressed lrish. with bulky  .

white knit sweaters, tweed and corduroy

walking jackets. or wide wale corduroy
pants.

In no other bar around here have I felt
so confident that, were I to start up with a
few lines of “the Wild Rover" or “The Jug
of l’unch."l would be joined by a crowd
of people who knew at least some of the
words. of had heard the songs before at
some family gathering.

- Of course. on weekends the percentage
of lrish types falls, not so much because
the locals go elsewhere, it‘s just that
there‘s a tremendous inﬂux of non-local
bodies, as happens every weekend in most
of the downtown bars when on-campus
people feel freed by the approach of the
weekend and venture to the end of the
busline. After all. if you live on Western
Avenue right across from the Washington
Tavern. you can be reasonably sure you‘ll
manage to stumble home each night. But
catching, boarding. and riding the bus
back to campus, making your way form
the circle to your quad, then to your
dorm, your floor. suite. room. to finally
collapse cxhaused in your own bed
(hopefully), might seem a frightening
proposition if you didn‘t have at least a
day or two to recuperate.

Now, though some people may say I, as
an Irishman. am biased. it's not just the

people who treq uont the

praises of Erin l‘m singing here. Sure. I
love the Clancy brothers and the pipes, I
drink Guinness and enjoy the
commaraderilr that comes with sharing a
common ethnic background. and I love to
sing the old songs and hear stories ofthe
many revolutions.

But I‘m fourth generation Irish, and
had pooh-poohcd any connection with
my "heritage" as senseless nationalism
and sentimentality up until I came to
Albany two years ago. But whether it was
the activity ofethnic groups on campus or
the people i fell in with. nevertheless I
began to realize what it. meant to
"identify" with it tradition.

For some reason. it's affirming to feel
you have a history. not just a personal
history, but a history shared by others, it
makes you feel a part of something larger
than your own little private world.
There's something special in this in this
feeling, and it transcends
lot of the gaps that exist between most
people most ofthe time, and makes them
feel comfortable with each other, at least
until they run out of songs to sing. But
even that‘s something.

And this is what I am singing the
praises of, and what can be felt,at times in
a place like the Washington Tavern. And,
if you‘ve got the right people there, this
inclusivity will often manifest itself in
sometimes loud and off—key, other times
a soft and harmonic. but always
communal song. And it won‘t matter if
you‘re lrish. or ifyoucan sing. because it‘s
the bonds that singing forrns between
' people that are important, not nationality
or musicality.

But I haven‘t seen this happen in WT‘s
for quite ii while. and that's too bad.
because that was one of the things that
had always made the place seem a little
different from the other local bars. Even if
it didn't happen, there was always the

" possibility it would. a possibility I've

never felt existed in a place like the Lark.
because it‘s too big and the crowd too

‘ varied, or even O'Heaney's. because the
. place has no tradition.

But now there‘s a pinball machine in
the back room corner where lrisii Joe or
Michael or Kevin used to sit with their old
guitars and older songs, and the T.V. over
the bar somehow manages to stay turned

[on until eleven some weeknights, it the
bartender doesn’t~click it off before the

‘ .early late crowd gets sucked into the video

goo.

Monday nightfootball is onething. but
sitcoms and T.V. movies don‘t belong
anywhere, let alone a place supposedly

geared toward interpersonal
communications. There‘s something
perverse about fifty people sitting around
Ia darkened bar. drinking slowly. their
upturned faces all bathed in T.V. screen
blue. with everybody straining to hear the
lobotomized dialogue from the tube.

But the place still has its comfortable
little window nook up front, old-fashioned
red globe lamps over the bar, and paper
plate sized pizzas with about a pound of
cheese on them for late night belly
rumblings.

The low ceiling, dim lights and
relatively small size of the bar give it it

comfortably enclosed atmosphere. and.

the crowd is pretty conventional looking.
acting, and sounding, so there‘s no need
to feel out of place or uncomfortable here.
unless you happen to have it penchant for
the bizarre.

Although a good percentage of the

a crowd. particularly on weekends. is

young, mostly undergraduate age, there is
also a regular older crowd which usually
hangs out in the front ofthe bar. The two
age groups don't seem to mingle much.
but neither do they get on each other‘s
nerves. thcyjust sort of occupy the same
space at the same time.

And then there are a few really old
regulars, like Old Jack, who add color to
anyplace they frequent. and remind
students that there's a good portion of life
to be got through even aftergraduation.

Old Jack stops off every night on his
way home from work. sometimes late,lfor
his “regular” to keep warm for the few
blocks he has to walk. Old Jack with his
weathered hands and beat up straw had,
who always takes it straight up with a

“little ginger on the side, “cuz I don't I
don’t want to spoil the whiskey." He

‘ never has to ask for it, it's always waiting
on the bar for him when he gets to it,
because it takes ltim a while to get there
front the door. the door that sometimes
gives him trouble in winter, when his
hands are a little stiffened up and the wind
is blowing.

And Old Jack can tell you stories of
“when there wasn‘t no T.V. in this bar.
and people had to do more talkin", “and

V when he played hurling on the Polo
Grounds in Brooklyn, when Albany was
“an Irish town"and there were juke
boxes in the bars, and people may; their
own music. .

“ln them days, “ Old Jack smiled.
“everybody knew the old songs. It didn't
matter if you was Eye - talian orjewish.
