f you like to eat, then you'll
probably love “Who is Killing
the Great Chefs of Europe?"
and even if you don't, you
might just love it anyway.
What we have here is a film that captures
gloriously every mouth watering aspect of
the culinary art. Dish after dish ofsome of
the best foods in the world are ﬂashed
past us all over Europe, and if you go to
the theatre hungry, you might just
accidentally rush the screen.

Jay Glasen

Amidst the goodies is Robert Morley
as the haughty editor of a high class food
magazine. Morley is eating himself into
oblivion, and when his taste buds aren‘t
busy (rarely), be is a scathing wit, whose
tongue never stops unleasing hilarious
insults at the people around him.

Morley is preparing a banquet for the
Queen of England, and he enlists the

services of some of the greatest chefs in

the world for each of the courses. One of
those chefs is Jacqueline Bisset, who is
one of the world's great pastry makers. At
the other end of the spectrum is George
Segal, her ex~husband who is the head of
a fast food empire. He's in London at the
same time, developing his latest culinary
con game, a chain of omelete shops.
Everything is hunky dory until Bisset,
as Natasha, spends a night with a
renowned Swiss chef, who‘s discovered
the next morningin his oven,roasted like
his legendary pigeon in croute. Fromthen
on, it's non-stop madness, until the
dramatic ending provides the final
dessert.
Besides the joy of gazing upon these
great dishes, we are also treated to some
damn good comedy. Everything is
covered from slapstick food fights to
viciously cutting insults by‘ Morley as
Mas Vandervere.

n the misty upper reaches of

the Campus Center lives a

band of ugly little trolls and

goblins who destroy well

written prose like a raging
Kansas tornado. These are the ASP
editors, and they are hated by reporters
all over SUNYA.

Mark Joseph,

Not only are these people ugly to look
at, but their personalities leave something
to be desired also. Just the other day, I
Was sitting very comfortably in mylivingj
room, enjoying a little light reading and
music, when the phone rang. The voice on
the other end had an alcoholictwangto it,
and I recognized the familiar bass tones of
th Associate News Editor: '

“Where‘s your story?" he slurred into
my ear. I could hear loud laughingin the
background, and occasionally one voice
could be heard above the rest.

“We're going to screw over SA this year

 

 

 

   
    

for sure." the voice said. “Or my name
isn‘t M. Jay Martello."

The laughing grew louder, with some
“right on's" thrown in for good measure. I
turned my attention back to the’
inebriated editor‘s question. It was quite
an effort to get him to hear over all the
confusion.

Remember, though, that all of this is a
backdrop for a murder mystery, and the
laughs are incorporated well with the
occasionally scary moments. This ﬁlm is

I one of your better “comedy who dunnits"

I — the laughs are there, and still you try all

.movie long to figure out who in the hell
would want to kill these men makingthe.
greatest food in the world.

George Segal plays his usual role as a
lighthearted romantic comedian, trying
|to‘win back his ex—wife, and keep her
alive. Segal‘s performances never lét me
down, and in all of his roles, you can‘t
help but like him.‘ln this ﬁlm, Robby
Ross is just as likeable, as he romances
Natasha, backto him, and does some fun
things, like riling up a vegetarian
restaurant as a meat loving Texan.

Jacqueline Bisset‘s part takes on a
slightly different tone. She is simply a
very beautiful cook, who mainly sleeps
with other chefs. Therefore, she can’t ruin
the part - her looks can only help it. She
is quite successful, and with her touch of

an accent, manages to make it through
the Whole ﬁlm very well from the kitchen
to the bed.

In a country where McDonald‘s is the
final Word in dinner, this film should be
extremely popular. We just love to eat
and eat and eat, and if the food looks
good enough, we also love to watch
people eat and eat. Well the food does
look good enough and so does the script,
the acting and the laughs.

My advice is to go see this movie on a
laid back evening before dinner. Get a.
little bit high, and after salivating
throughout, rush out of the theatre, and'
land in the nearest good restaurant
around. The feeling is one of ccstacy, as
you stuff yourself and reflect on how{
funny the damn thing was.

Good comedy. Good mystery. And
damn good for the munchies.

 

 

 

“I put it in your box," I shoutediFor it
was true, as all good reporters do,l had,
gotten my story in at least five hours
early.

“Weren‘t you assigned to the article
about scuba diving at Indian Lake?“ he
asked.

“No, you gave me my story yourself,
the one about the editors of Ggm’ng 0ff|
holding a party where [4 people hadto be;
taken to Albany Med for food‘
poisoning."

“Oh, so you‘re the one. Yeah, we got
yourstory right hcrc,sorry to disturb you i
kid."

Well, I never Would have known it.
When I read the story the next day in the

 
 
 
 

 

paper, I found it to bejusta little different
than the way I had written it. The fourth
paragraph was now the ninth, and the
sixth was completely missing. Not only
that, but there were quotes form
Presidnet O‘Lcary stuck right in the
middle, about the conditions oftoilets in.
the Campus Center. That wasn‘t exactly
part of my story.

I found the editors ofthe ASP later that
day, as they sat in the Rat havingtheir
traditional post-production night pitcher‘-
piirty. They looked like they'd been up for
days, and their dispositions were
somewhat on the negative side.

Everything that l tasted was delicious.
Carolyn O'Dcll promptly returned,
recapturing the audience‘s attention
without any problem. She took out a
banjo and started the second set with a
lively country tune, adding some
unconventional guitar riffs for variety.
She played about four banjo songs, one of
which was a sing-a-long, and then ended
the evening with a guitar song entitled
“Ain‘t You (lot a Right to the Tree of
Life.“ Ms. O'Dcll was welcomed back for
an encore in which she did a gospel song
that left everyone in good spirits.
