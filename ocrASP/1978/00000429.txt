ieel we can get outside against them.
Also, they'don'tcndure Well. Late in
the game last week they made a lot of
substitutions, and that‘s when ,we
can start running inside.”

Albany's wishbone attack, which
relies on’quick outside runs and
pitchouts. might have a ﬁeld day
against two immobile linemen.
However, the Eagles managed to sti-
Ile Buffalo's ground game, limiting
them to just 12 net rushing yards.

The Eagles‘ defensive strength lies
in their linebacking corps. This
might compensate for some of the.
weaknesses in the line. Senior
linebacker Frank McNulty (6‘l",
2l5) is an "outstanding ballplaycr."

according to Silverstri.

"Last week, wherever the ball was,
he was there. I think he was the only
Brockport player with a dirty un-
Iform." Playing alongside McNulty
will bejunior Tom Cleary (6'3". 215).

The Brockport secondary has a
split personality. The left side is
strong. but the right can be beaten.

I Free safety Tom Cauley. (6'1", 200)

and cornerback Bernard McGilI
(S‘l I", 185) anchor a strong left side
coverage. but it will be the right side
that the Danes will work on. “We‘ll
try to take advantage of their Weak
spot,“ said Silverstri.

For the Danes. two players were
injured in the Southern Connecticut
game and may not see action. Guard

iTom Copelli suffered a sprained

Scarpinato. Running back Jack
Burger also sustained an ankle in-
jury. and is questionable for
Brockport.

The Danes captured their first win
of the season last week, 28-12 over
Southern Connecticut. Albany look~

ed impressive, but still have some ‘

areas for improvement.

“We had much too many fumbles
and penalties las week." said Ford.
“But we did con olthc line ofscrim-
mage and I felt we showed good
progress in one week."

Next week the Danes have their
homecoming against a tough squad
from Maryland, Towson State.

grouped their talents and the family

Dario lofted a long, high clear

fullbacks to approach Anderson by

shot low into the corner for the
equalizer at 27:48. Carlos has all
three Albany goals this season.
“The midﬁelders and forwards

this year," Schieffelin said. “Afrim

they‘re all meshing much better.”

Aguilar, a midfielder from

~ Brooklyn, was another causally of
the trip north. He hobbled from the

playing field with a sprained ankle in

the second half, and was replaced by

the third Amngo. Luis. Wenael's in-

jury may prove the more serious of

the two. He was relieved by Jon

Shaw. a senior from Locust Valley.

Albany had a few more decent
chances with the swift Carlos
Arango breaking ahead once again.‘
Anderson, who played very well.
stiﬂed these few Dane attempts and
patiently waited for his mates to
muster some offense. This is not the
same Hurtwick bunch ofa year ago,
having lost seven folks to gradua-
‘tion. but they're still asound squad.
' Late in the second overtime, the
Hurtwick onslaught broke the Dane
resistance. Sobolewski dribbled past
Shaw and sped in unmolested on
.Arnngo. The goalie tried to cut off
the angle, but ht‘ was helpless.
Sobolcwski paused .mghtly and then
drilled a chest-high drive to the right
side of a Iunging Danc'kcepcr, and
Hurtwick was the victor.

“When you play these fine [cums
you expect tltc close. low-scoring
games and a missed opportunity can
often maki- the difference."
Schieffelin explained. “We had a
couple of possible chnnccs that we
didn't convert on and Anderson was
outstanding on a few others. It‘s aw-
fully frustrating to lost.- these games;
we know we're better titan l-3-l."

Previously Schieffelin said he
thought no more than four losses

could he suffered by Albany if the ‘

Danes hoped for a berth in the
playoffs. He is sticking totltut hclicf.
I'Iutt mctins Albany will have to
charge through the remainder of it
tough schedule with a mere loss to
qualify. Cortland, Division ' Ill
runncrup in '77. is next.

“Ont: of these days everything is
gonna fit and we're just going to tear
somebody apart," Schieffelin said in
reference to the squad which may
not have reached its peak yet. “No
way. we linicn't ncurly reached our
potential yet. We have a good rivalry
with Cortland, we won 2-] last year.
I hopt: that somebody is Cortland
tomorrow."
