Cadet Harriers Defeat J ayvees

by .llrn Roth

The Albany State junior varsity
cross country team ran into a for-
midable opponent in Army last Fri-
day at West Point. The defeat came
on a wet. hilly ﬁve-mile course, and
when the ﬁnal tally was taken. the
Great Dancswerc on theshort end of
a l5-48 score. ‘

“Army is always tough, and this is
the best Army team we‘ve ever run
against. varsity or junior var-
sity."varsity cross country coach
Bob Munsey said. Thcjunior varsity
results conﬁrmed Munscy‘s state-
ment. The top ﬁve ﬁnishers were
Cadets. led by Tom Wuchtc‘s time of
27:05. and average of 5225 per mile.

Ismael Cruz was Albany‘s top
finisher in sixth position in 27:55.

The Dancs‘ next three ﬁnishers were
Dave Goldberg, Matt VanBurcn.
and Dave Fabian. placing l8th.
27th. and 3Ist. respectively.

“They were very strong and very
deep." Goldberg said. “The con-
ditions weren't very good. The
course was wet and it had a few big
hills. Thfy just had a lot of good
runners."

Similar Fate

Although the varsity harricrs suf-
fered a similar fate at‘thc hands of
the Cadets. Munsey was calm over
the outcome ofeither meet. “Hell no.
Army wasjust a super team.“ hesaid
with a shrug. “i expect a lot more
good competition. Williams has
beaten us the last three years. We run
them away on Saturday. And next

Saturday. we have Colgate here (JV
meet starts at I2:00,varsityat 12:30).
In varsity. we're deadlocked at ﬁve
wins each. This is the rubber match."

Munsey was satisﬁed with the out-
come of the jayvec meet against such
strong competition. and emphasized
the importance of a good “leader”
program in building strong varsity
runners. "A junior varsity is an ab-
solute necessity with regards to run-
ning cross country." he said.

“They have to be prepared to
make the shift from a 2.8 mile high
school course to a ﬁve-mile. or
i0.000-metcr college course."
Munscy added. “There isjust no way
to make good varsity runners if
jayvcc doesn't toughen them up
first."

“After I get married. l'm going to

rest and practice, I couldn't because
of some commitment."
