It was a real dogﬁght.

The Danes. with new venom in
their fangs followingthe upset of es-
teemed Oneonta. traveler! upstate to
meet the defending NCAA Division
I soccer champions. Hartwick.
Wednesdriy. Albany scrapped and
claWed with spirited vigor through
regulation play and into yet another
overtime before they lapsed momen—
tarily. and the champs took the final
bite.

The initial extra period proceeded
with both sides unscathed. Hartwick
saw an opening, however. in the next
overtime. when stellar Dane
defenseman Mark chzel left the
game with a wrist injury. Hartwick
ran their offense at chzel‘s replace-
ment and finally. with 4:07 left. be

forged ahead and scored. giving
Hartwick a 2-l victory.

games. The greatest opponent for
the Danes now in a rush to qualify
for the NCAA Division III playoffs
may be the calendar; not mentioning
a few touted schools. For now. the
seasonal mark is a sorrowful l-3-I.

Danes At Brockport: Will Tradition Hold?

by Paul Schwartl

On paper. the Danes (l-l) should
be able to beat Brockport (l-2)
tomorrow night. Albany has a solid
football nucleus. while the Golden
Eagles of Brockport are in a building
stage. As a further indication. the
Danes have taken four straight
games from Brockport. including

last year's 40-l4 romp.

However, football is not played on
paper. .

“They've got a way to go yet."said
Albany defensive coach Jack
Silverstri. “But they have aggressive
kids. and they're hungry for a vic-
tory."

“They‘re in the process ofbuilding
their program." commented Danes'

head coach Bob Ford. “1 think our
kids have a healthy respect fortbem.
Brockport has a good sports
program. so they have some talented
athletes." ‘

If an upset occurs. it will most
probably be due tothe Eagle offense.
which ran up over 400total yards in
a 35-3l loss to Buffalo last week.
Possessing a number of capable run~
ning backs. Brockport can move the
football.

The key man the Danes must con—
tain is halfback Neil Boykans.
Against Buffalo. Boykans rushed
with the brill only five times. brrt
made each carry count as he charged

for 77 yards. Albany has seen
Iloyktins before, but not its a half~
back. Two years ago. Boykeiis ran
the option as the Eagles quarter—
back. but switched positions when
his rushing prowess was noticed.

 

“He‘s got real good moves," said
Silverstri. “If he starts. we rcitlly
have to watch out for him.“

Brockport accumulated last Week

who‘s strong. but not that fast." ac.
cording to Silverstri. Junior Bobby
Smith (5'9". I90) was the Eagles‘
leading ballcarrier with 84 yards
against Buffalo.

“They have quite a few good
backs.“ added Silverstri. “but their
last game could have been mis-
leading. Buffalo's defensive line is
not that good. and that could ex—
plain why Brockport ran so well.“

The Eagles usea Wing-T offensive
setup. with a great deal of backfield
action. Leading the attack is senior
quarterback Karl Ulrich (6‘2". 200).
.who put the ball in the air 33 times
against Buffalo. Ulrich completed 15
for Lil yards. and his short passing
grime will have to be contained by
the Albany defenders.

“He throws a lot of flair passes to
his halfbacks." said Silverstri. “He
doesn't throw long. and he is also no
threat to run."

Ulrich's favorite target is split end
Roy Volilon. who caught two scor-
ing tosses a week ago. “He's got good
speed, good hands. and good
moves." commented Silverstri. "I‘or
sortie reason he didn't start last Week.
but he's better than anyone else they
have." Sophomore Gordon Glose

receiver against Buffalo with five
receptions. and has "average speed
and decent hands." according to
Silverstri.

“That‘s their half team." Silverstri
said of the Brockport offense. “Their
offensive line didn‘t let the quarter-
back get sacked against Buffalo.and
they got a lot of yards and points.“

Brockport plays a pure 5-2
defense. and the Danes hope to ex-
ploit certain weaknesses in the Eagle
lineup. The two largest areas stack
up at the tackle position. where a
pair of bookends play. Freshman

the right tackle spot. while senior
John Siaiiano (6‘l“. 260) resides in
the left position. These two huge
linemen crtii lead to Albany‘s success
or to their failure.

“They're both very big, but they’re
slow." explained Silverstri. "We'll
have a hard time moving them, and it
will be difficult to run at them. but I

Center for x-rays, rind without

Cortland tomorrow night here.

Albany's offense, which has done
a complete about-face since the
opening soft stretch. played equal
with the Hartwick forwards and ac-
tually took the flow away frorn thcrii
at points. Dario Arango provided
his consistent hrillance in the cage by
garnering lit saves to Aly Ander-
son‘s nine as Hartwick's keeper.

having beatcn top-ranked Onconta
last weekend. They may fall a notch
now. but the relatively solid standing
for a team with it tncdiocrc record
shows the pollsters' appreciation of
Albany‘s painstaking schedule.
Quite possibly. they are thctop [-3-]
team in the nation.

“People do recognize the caliber
of our schedule and some arcaetual-
ly amazed at our opponents for a
Division III school." said Danes'
coach Bill Schicffclin. “We enjoy
playing the best schools and feel we
have the team to do it: we‘re playing
even with them but just not getting
the breaks."

I'lariwick did outshoot Albany 2|-
II and three of their attempts were
negated only because they struck the
crossbar. The Dunes were persistent
throughout. however. and their oc-
crisional reluctance to shoot may
ltavc accounted for the disparity in
shots. Scliieffelin said. They proved
to be unafraid of I‘Iartwick's past
achievement and fought back totic.

Carey to Support Fee Repeal

by Aron Smlth

Governor Hugh Carey will of-
ficially recommend the repeal ofthe
SUNY-wide health fee Sunday. ac-
cording to Student Association of
the State University ’(SASU) Presi-
dent Steve Allinger. '

Allingcr said he was informed of
Carey's decision Wednesday by
Friends of Carey Youth Coor-
dinator Sue Hirsbkowitz.

position after it was facatcd by the
firing of Sandy Sangiovanni last
month. according to Allinger.

Although. at a press conference
yesterday. Crircy denied having
promised to repeal the health fee. a
news release outlining Carey‘s new
position on the issuc has been
prepared and is awaiting rclcrtsc. iIt'-
cordiitg to Allinger.

I'lic $8.50 per semester health fee
has been attacked by SASU as an
"illegal rind immoral tuition in-
crease." as revenue generated by the
lee is placcti in the SUNY (iencral
l-‘und and is not trscd to improve
health care for SUNY students.

According to Assistant Assembly
Majority Leader Arthur Eve (I)-
Butfalo). the health fee was in-

troduced into the New York State
Executive Budget as a last minute
fund raising effort by an Assembly
Ways and Means Committee staff
member in I977. ’

"At the end of the period. it was
very. very hectic." said Eve. "It was
just one of those things that slip
through."

After considerable student lob-
bying and a petition drive. SUNY‘s
Board of Trustccs'agreed last Oc-
tober to remove the health fee from
its |‘)78-79 budget recommendations
to Carey. According to Allinger.
however. Carey rcplaccd the fee in
the Executive Budget draft sub-
riiittcd to tlic legislature for ap-
proval. This draft wastipproved.and
took effect when signed by Corey.

Despite this action. Carey has rin-

legislature and cart only be repealed
by the legislature.
