DIETETIC SEX

In this era when jUst aborit
everyone is weight conscious, a new
book is out explaining how to take
off these unwanted pounds simply
by engaging in sex.

The how-to book. by author
Richard Smith, is titled Dieter'r
Guide To Weight Loss During Sex.
It is published by the Workman
Publishing Company. Smith says he
decided to concentrate on sex as a
weight loss vehicle because. in his
words. “It‘s one activity that's pretty
much universal to everybody."

The Work is free-wheeling, con-
taining a guide on the number of
calories a person can burn up during
a vrrriety of sexual activities. Smith
says that even when things don‘t go
right. sex can help remove inches of
ugly fat: As an example. he says.try-
ing to remain calm after getting
caught in the act requires [00
calories; or accidentally calling your
partner the wrong name can burn up
another 50.

logs showed.

F.C.C. Commissioners ruled that
even though many of the extra
remarks ~made during the com-
mericals were humorous. it still
resulted in the station spending more
time on commericals than was being
acknowledged.

Several of the commissioners. in
handing down their decision. ad-
mitted that they themselves often
listen to the program in question and
find the remarks quite humorous.
However. they added. anything that
extends the length ofacommericnl is
against the FCC rule's.

BEE BRAINS

Researchers in West Germany
report they have succeeded in the
first brain transplant operation on
bees.

The three researchers at the In-
stitute of Zoology at the University
of Rontgctrring say they first trained
a group of bees to eat at a specific
time. They then report decapitating
those bees. taking out portions of
their brains and transplanting those
portions to another group of bees.

The researchers report that the
recipient bees. instead of eating at

LUNG WARNINGS

A new Harvard University
medical study has found that the
young children of parents who
smoke show distinct evidence of im-
paired breathing.

Professor l. B. Tager says asurvey
of 444 families in the Boston area has
discovered that the “lung flow rates“
in children between the ages of five
and nine were lower in smoking
families than in non-smoking ones.

An earlier British study concluded
that cigarette smoking by parents
doubled the risk of an attack of
pneumonia or bronchitis in their in-
fants.

YANKEE FREEZE

Here's a sign of the times: One of
the hotter selling records in Texas is
a country and western tune called
" Freeze A Yankee." '

The 45 recording, cut by a group
called .Facal Minority: urges folks
in Texas and other oil-rich states to
turn their air'conditioners up and
drive the biggest gas-guzzling cars
they can find rather than ship their
oil to the colder northeast.

A spokesperson at Don‘s Records
in Houston explains: “The message
of the record is that if the
northeasterners aren't willing todrill
off their coasts for oil, then they
damn well deserve to freeze.“

Don‘s records reports t hat “Freeze
A Yankee" is the fastest selling recor—
ding in their current stock.
