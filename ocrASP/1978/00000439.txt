Great spot for the columned-out
SUNYA to let himself go off on a
hetwecn-the-lines tangent, a healthy
weekend fantasy to bridge the gaps this
cold campus creates. To some it's an all or
nothing Springsteenish wish for a night to
last forever, while for others it‘s a mellow
respite from the textbook pressures.

Success depends on what it is one
wants. and upon who it is one needs —
often failure is inherent. But the object of
the game isn‘t absolute victory; rather it's
a few rnoment‘s dance with the person one
wants to be. Who knows what ﬂoats at
the bottom of a glass. . .

For me it goes like this:

I see Bogic looking past a cigarettein a
picture on the far wall, and suddenly I am
at Rick‘s clutching that bottle of
bourbon. Squinting through the grey
have I can almost certainly see Ingrid
Bergman, weeping, moving towards me
across my imagination.

She is beautiful, and I cannot have her.

Ah sweet intoxication. . .and it really
works'if you give it a good try. That is, it
the music fits. It‘s the total package that
Bogarts offers which makes it so
attractive. You‘ve got all the tools for a
ﬁrst—rate fantasy: tunes, spirits, and the
opposite sex.

The average Saturday night traveller
moves with either the magic of a high
or the terror of selfdoubt. The latter seek
ends, the former means, but usually the
two meet somewhere in the inebriatcd
middle. Which is why Jackson Browne
sells so many records to the mediocre
depressed.

Actually, Bogarts is similar to our fair
university center itself. It serves a mass of
individuals who often pay little or no
attention to the meanderings of one
another. While fantasy is the rule, it
doesn‘t hold that every fantasy is the
same, or that anyone is into anybody
else‘s. Or, put another way, while we all
cradle Pina Coladas, different things ﬂoat
in different glasses.

The trick is to talk through your mask
while keeping the message intelligible. Be
who you want. Let everyone else be who
they want. Then go out and carry on
anything but a meaningful conversation
through the shufﬂe.

If you find this sort of attitude hast.
vulgar and wholly pessimistic, you‘re
probably better off skipping Bogarts and
going straight to the library. But there is
absolutely nothing wrong with trying on a
different pair of shoes when the spirit
moves you. It is the stuffthat dreams and.
perhaps, compassion is made of.

Which is why, if you happen upon a
slow moving ﬁgure on Ontario Street
who is muttering something about “the
start of a beautiful friendship," and you
can‘t see a piano, it is best for all
concerned that you keep right on
walking.

However, I'd much rather that you'd
talk to me about Paris.

Smokin along llllt
Cheech Gt Chong '

t has been six years since the
release of their ﬁrst album, but
the satirical wizardry of the
derelict duo, Cheech Marin
‘ and Tommy Chong has not
faltered. In their first cinematic
endeavor, “Up In Smoke"lhetwo wander
from scene to hilarious scene in a quest
for the perpetual high. In fact that is the
picture‘s entire concern, which will cause
it to be coldly received by many and prove
ultimately to be its major ﬂaw.

 

Erlc Salzlngor

 

Pedro (Cheech) decides to leave his
I..A. barrio home in search of greener
pastures. He gets into his beat-up
“Chebby” complete with custom
chainlink steering wheel, fringe bills
around the windows and starts offtojoin
his band. Meanwhile, Man (Tommy
Chong), the product of a rich Middle-
American upbringing throws his drum set
into his VW bug and cuts out.

Man‘s car breaks down on the road and
after stuffing some clothes in certain
strategic places he tries hitching a ride. He
is spotted on the other side ofthe road by
Pedro. The self-styled Spanish stud
makes an instant u-turn across a six lane
highway only to ﬁnd out that the girl of
his dreams wasn't. Now the real fun
begins.

Throughout the film, Pedro and Man
find themselves in the most insane
situations with the most insane people.
We meet them all ~ from nymphatic
groupies to narcotic rockers to neurotic
cops. They are all tied together with a very
weak plot that more closely resembles a
stream of consciousness than a story line.

a unique concert
encompassing three periods of
jazz, saxophonist Nick
Brignola brought some
downright great music to

SUNYA‘s Page Hall last Sunday night.
Sponsored by the new Jazz Studies
Program of the College of General
Admissions (non-credit division), the
program lasted a good portion of three
hours What originally appeared to be a

Hall‘s opening grew into a near-capacity
audience; an excellent turnout.

songs from the swing era as he opened the

Ellington‘s “In A Mellow Tone".

vocalist Helen Humes entered the stage
before a more than acccepting audience.
Dressed in black with diamond sequins
and jewelery, Humes then led the group
into “I Can‘t Believe You're In Love With
Me." At the end of the tune, the singer
explained gleefully that “It‘s so nice to be
up here tonight with the babys". Her

What Cheech and Chong have done in
this screenplay is drawn heavily on their
LPskits adapting them for the storv. That
does not in any way suggest that any
magic has been lost in the transition. The
duo is obviously well acquainted with the
whole “scene"they are poking fun at. For
example, Man and Pedro have just
finished smoking a torpedo-sized joint
and have riddenup on thecurb in Pedro's
car and crashed into a pole. Man slowly
turns his head to Pedro and says, “Hey. I
don't think we're moving, man."

Such dialogue, while lacking luster in
print, captures the stoned-out feeling of
most of the people in the theatre.

There are few major characters in the
story and those few are beyond belief.
Cheech exempliﬁes that cute boyish
innocence that just makes all the girls go
wild (or at least he thinks so). Chong, is a
bit more mature, if you can believe that.
He means no harm to anyone and
concerns himself only with where his next
high comes from. Taken together they
represent the ideal existence, hanging in
there doing the best they can and having a
good tinc doing it.

At one point Pedro goes off with his
cousin Strawberry, (he has an unsightly
mark on half his face) to score some dope
when they spot the cops. Strawberry
(Tom Skeritt) suddenly imagines that he‘s
back in Vietnam and jumps off his
motorcycle leaving Pedro helplessly
nestled in the sidecar, and promises to go
and get air support. Sherritt is wonderful
as the blemished veteran. He is so
convincingly schizophrenic you could
hear the gunfire in the background. His
crazed gaze maintained the tension of his
presence but he never lost the comic

singing. While Brignola’s group provided
excellent . backup, Brignola himself
switched off to the clarinet several times.
Helen Humes finished up with “It Ain‘t
Nobody's Business If I Do", “The Birth
Of The Blues“ and another blues number
but the audience clearly did not get
enough of her so the radiant Humes
returned with a final number; “You're
Turn To Cry For Me“.

spirit. .

Upon his return to Strawberry's house,
Pedro discovers that it is being raided by
the narcs. Their leader is the infamous
Sergeant Stadenko from “Sister Mary
Elephant", played by Stacy Keach.
Stadenko is a ne'er-do-well chief
detective, surrounded by the largest
collection of bumbling idiots. He is given
the task, as we later learn, of conﬁscating
the largest shipment of marijuana in
existence. Keach‘s rendition of Sadenko
is ﬂawless. He paints the alkyd sergeant
like a comic strip character, a sort of
Charlie Brown and Dick Tracy all rolled
into one. He evokes such sympathy for
the pathetic Stadenko one could just
jump into the picture and make the bust
for him. _

Making her silver screen debut in this
film is actress Zane Busby. She plays a
groupie that the boys pick up on the
roadside during their travels. Though she
is an outstanding sight in the picture,she
has little to offer us save her outrageous
body. Maybe in her next ﬂick she‘ll even
get some dialogue.

()ne of the keys to the overall type of
appeal that “Up In Smoke” has is Lou
Adler. This is only Adler's third film but

returned with his band from the ﬁrst set
along with trumpeter Chet Baker for are-
creution of sounds from the bebop era.
Starting out with Charlie Parker‘s
“Deak”, Baker and Brignola displayed
some excellent musicianship. On the
second number, “I Remember You",
Baker sang in soft and skat styles besides
playing his silver trumpet, While the
second set had a bit more improvisational
technique than the first, it did notseem as

his experience in the lifestyle it reﬂects is '
vast. His subtlety in placing the camera
and composing the sets enhance the zany
style of Cheech and Chong. Many of the
hidden gags will appeal only to those who
consider themselves heads or at the very
least pot smokers. After all the ad says
that you should not see the moviq
straight. This is advice well taken, for
otherwise you might get lost as the story
ambles from scene to scene. Interestingly
enough. Adler‘s first ﬁlm was“The Rocky
Horror Picture Show" which in many
ways is similar to “Up In Smoke” in the
audience it appeals to and the casual plot.

Strangely enough, this picture is rated
R. This will hurt unbearably at the box
ofﬁce where a large part ofwhat would be
the prime audience will be turned away.
There doesn't seem to be any real reason
for the rating except the free use of;
narcotics, which is admittedly semi-valid.
Regardless, what We have here In

electric.

The third set featured Brignola with a
new younger band performing more
contemporary jazz works. Instead ofthe
trumpet, drums and bass accompaniment
of the ﬁrst two sets, the third employed
guitar instead of trumpet. in the ﬁrst
song, Fats Waller‘s “Jitterbug Waltz",
Brignola played clarinet again in a style
that was anything but waltz-like. This
number was probably the best appeciated
of the third set’s numbers. The tunes
became more energetic, but the crowd
was getting less so. Also, the factthatthe
concert was now running over two hours
added to the general restlessness of the
audience. Brignola's new group displayed
a lot of enthusiasm in their playing and
some of the tunes performed were their
own such as "Piece Of The Rock" in
which Brignola played lyrieon(wind-
synthesizer). As the music became more
progressive, the audience‘s appreciation
seemed to decrease. ’

Nick Brignola displayed a lot of talent
on all of the wind instrument he played
and put on a very good show. The only
two real disappointments this critic had
were the inability of the lighting crew to
spotlight the performer playing solo and
the long length ofthe performance. In this
respect, maybe the audience got “too
much of a good thing." Still, the program
was a success and will surely make alot of
people aware of the Jan Studies
Program. Brignola himself will be_
teaching one of the courses and if the
night's show was any indication, his class. '
