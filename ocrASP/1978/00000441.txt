clings

spledidly as a desperate lover in a
phonebooth.‘ However, from here on
through. its’s generally‘downhill. “One
Way 0r Another" may have been a good
cut with some stronger backup work but
instead sounds like an out-take from .“The
Electric Company".

“Fade Away And Radiate" is one of the
exceptions on the "Lines" LP. It‘s a slow
. tune with a lot of sophisticated electronics

reminiscent of Brian Eno‘s work.

“I Know But I Don‘t Know" is the only
‘real‘rnew wave song on the album and
suceeds in being a good anthem for it’s
followers with lines like: .

I give but I don't get
I will but I Won't yet
I lose'bui I don't her
I'm your dog but not your pet

Side Two opens with a fair, generally
fast ditty entitled “1 1:59“ which is
folloWed by a good performance in“Will
Anything Happen". It‘s probably the best
as well as the most humorous cut on the
album. Harry, in explaining to a friend
not to overextend his stay. tells him:
“Don't go away rad
Don't go pre-fab
Don't go be-bad

Don't go wawy mad, just go away"

On the whole. “Parallel Lines“ is
another fusion of the mid 60‘s girl groups
style with mid 70's new wave. Sometimes
the chemistry works. The real flaw here is

 

Parallel Linea.

lthough most new wave groups
don‘t produce albums in which
the music is catchy or polished.
Blondie has consistently been
doing both for about two
years. Their new album “Parallel Lines" is
a commercially viable album and will
probably do its best to put the group into
it greater share of the public eye. Yet while
the music is indeed on par with the best of

 

Scott Snyder

 

the new wave groups. their new album
seems to be afflicted with a lack of
innovation and diversity. The lyrics are
shallow a good deal of the time or when

they might have potential esoteric the ol‘ “most ofthe stuffsounds the same"
meaning. they just come off sounding syndromw. lt‘s indeed a shame because
stupid. Blondie is a group with a lot of talent and

could put out much better material. Tine
wonders whether the concern these days
is just to release new "product."

Side One opens with a catchy rocker in
“Hanging On the Telephone" in which
lead singer Deborah Harry aquits herself

idea. and I‘m glad they did. Yes has
 proven that they can master the grand
“’ .. concept; Tales From Topographic
Oceans was a two record symphony. To
continue along those lines would be
repetitive, and 'l‘ormaro further extends
the departure that Going For the One
initiated, but even more so.

The album opens with “Future Times.“
a pulsating rocker written by alliive band
members. This. by the way. is the ﬁrst
time since I972 that Rick Wakeman has
co-written a Yes song. and on this album.
he does three all together. The opening
number is lyrically not surprising. but has

Tormato.
s Yes‘ eleventh album delscends

into local record stores. I a lively beat in it that's lighter than the
realize that To rmaio usual Yes rocker.
completes another step The next song is “Don't Kill the

Whale." and marks Yes‘ first direct
message song in a long while. Even more
so than “Future Times.“ this song is
straight rock ‘n‘ roll with it downright
earthy solo by Steve Howe throughout.

The closing song furthers their
commitment to rock ‘n‘ roll for this
album. Release Release is an ode to
rock itself. with ii short live segment
interspersed in the middle. Could you
imagine that in the middle of Clara lo [’10
lit/go?

Side Two is equally interesting. and
kicks off with “Arriving Ufo." iijumpy

upward in the group‘s cosmic
trip to heaven. while reverting brilliantly
back to the simplicity ofthe ﬁrst two LP‘s
from almost ii decade ago.

 

Jay Glsson

Starting from their tirst album, titled
Yes. the group‘s albums have each
become more and more complicated.
both lyrically and musically. This may
have culmimited in 1974‘s Reloyer. a
musically complex album. with vague

 

lyrics and deep meaning.

Rick Wakemiin‘s return tothe groupin
l977,(aftcr a three—year Ieavc).resulted in
Going For The One. adepurture for Yes.
This album was no less great than any
other Yes album; it was merely a little
simpler lyrically, and it little bit easier to
get into musically. it was still an upward

demand an opus, “Awaken”. a classically
influenced piece. clocked in at over fifteen
minutes. (Length has no meaningto me.
but many a Yes fun resented the group
giving up its’stylc of long songs.

By the same token. Torman is also it
step upward. and for the first time since
l970, no song on the album even reached
eight minutes. On one level. Yes has

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely given up the concept. album

 

progression. and for those Yes fans who '

time highlighted by some great Wakenuin
keyboard. Don't expect the solos you
might hear on Tales. just expect good
playing.

“Circus of Heaven“ is the most
touching Yes song ever. Howe is subtely
brilliant in the background on the Gibson
Les Paul. and the song is a reggae-iin
fantasy for Jon's son. Damien. who even
talks on the song. It sounds it bit corny.
but it ends up working beautifully.

The last song on the album could bcthe
best of it“ eight. “On the Silent Winmi of
Freedom" is a classic Yes cut. withjazzy
undertones and dynamically powerful
cosmic lyrics.

So it seems its if the group has
