Tomorrow there is a full slate of

race. followed by the jayvee harriers.
and then the varsity meet. The oppo-
nent for both the varsity and junior
varsity is Colgate.

Munsey has been pointing
towards this meet for some time. A
good rivalry has built up between the
Great Dane runners and those of
Colgate. Add to this is the fact that
the series record is deadlocked at 5
wins apiece.

“They are traditionally tough."
said Munsey. The coach also pointed
out that although the Albany
harrich had done plenty of running
already this week. they would be up
for Colgate.

Rossi (President). Boccio (Match
Secretary). and "Animal" Al Toback
('l'rcasurer) are quite optimistic
about the upcoming season. as they
feel that there is a fine blend of
seasoned veterans together with a
host of talented newcomers.

Andrews, a transfer from Tufts
University. was credited by his corich‘
for bringing up the level of play of
the entire Danes team. “His hustle.”
said Schieffclin. “was very in-
spirational.“_ ’

Bal Control

The Danes played ball control for
the duration of the match and
Binghamton was unable to mount
any type of attack. At 40:25 Carlos
Arango received the ball near mid-
field and was able to go one-on-one
with the goalie. which is Arango‘s
specialty. He came in. faked once.
and then blasted the ball into the
lcfthand corner of the net. past the
helpless Binghamton goalie.

The goal. which closed the scoring
at 3-1. was Arango's fourth goal of
the season. Until Andrews' second
period goal. Arango had been the

only Dane to score a goal this season.
Arango was joined by his brother
Dario in having a ﬁne game. Dario.

saves and was instrumenal in keep-
ing the Danes close when the offense
was having its problems in the ﬁrst
half. I
The Danes ended the game out-
shooting Binghamton. recording 15
shots to Binghamton‘s Elk.
Scoreless Tie
Last Saturday. the Danes hosted
Cortland and played to a scoreless
tie. The two teams had a shootout
which will count only if Albany and
Cortland finish in a tie in the stan-
dings. Cortland won the shootout 4-
2. “We had three scoring oppor-
tunities during the game," said
Schieffclin. “and we couldn't cash
in." Schieffelin indicated that the
difference between the Cortland and
Binghamton games was that Albany

put on more pressure in the
Binghamton game (at least in the se-
cond hall). He said that he felt that
the team could make its own breaks
by applying even more pressure on
the opposition.

The Danes now have a record of
2-3-2 with their next game tomorrow
at Brockport. “It we win against
Brockport, it will ﬁre us up,"'said
Schieffelin. The Danes have already
played against most of the toughest
teams on their schedule and a Dane
winning streak is a good possibility.

' Albany is currently ranked eighth in

the state despite their record.

Schicffelin has said that if the
Danes do not lose more than four
games they have a good chance for
the playoffs. The Brockport game
seems to be the key to the Danes'for-
tunes. "If we can beat Brockport."
concluded Schieffclin. “it will put us
in excellent position."
