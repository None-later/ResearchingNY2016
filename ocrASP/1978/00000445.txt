Women’s Valleyball Team
Is Potential Powerhouse

by Cpthy Wegluz

Last season the Albany State
women's volleyball amassed a 16-6
record, varsity learn status. and an
astoundingly professional attitude
for a ﬁrst year team. Based on their
past performance it seems
reasonable to expect them to shine in
the limelight once again. Danes'
coach Susan Harrington echoes this
prediction quite emphatically.

This year Albany faces an im-
pressiver competitiye schedule,
playing against larger schools than

they did in the past.and doingacon-
siderable amount of traveling. They
seem ready for this challenge and
Harrington, who is new to the
Albany area, is conﬁdent that her
team will be able to offer a strong
threat to such schools as Colgate.
Oneonta and the University of Ver-
rnont.

Albany certainly has the potential
to accomplish this with a nucleus of
eight experienced letterwomcn. and
four freshmen who have Irotned into
Harrington‘s arduous practices with

the Albany State women‘s cross
country squad split with Williams
and IIarlwick on the former's 3.2-
ruile course. The home team was vic-
torious. winning [964—59. with the
Danes in second and Hartwick in
third.

Senior Dancs‘ captain Deb Rohr-
miller was Albany‘s top finisher in
22:40. followed by teammates Kim
Bloomer in 22:55 and freshman

Sue Merchant of Williams was the
individual winner in 21:33.

interest.

Captain Thomasa Dwyer is at the
heart of this nucleus. is senior whom
Harrington describes as a “super
setter and bitter." Dwyer is an ex-
perienced. all-around player, who
seems destined to lead the team to
success.

And then there is senior Karen
0‘ Reilly. who was elected SUNYA's
Female Athlete of the Year (I977-
78). and whose aggressive hitting on
the court helped in winning her this
honor.

Complementing these two women
are up and coming junior Allison
Deals. who is a fine setter and hitter;
and two freshmen who show a strong
potential in carrying on in the tradi-
tiou olthe team. Laura Herman and
Reba Miller both have experience.
and enough drive to propell them
Into important niches on the team.

Harrington speaks well of the
women‘s attitude and strong
cooperative spirit. She frankly ad—
mits that with the new conditioning
program she has instituted in prac-
tice. the work is tough. but the team
reacts \\itlr energy and excitement.

The Women's squad

has gotten oil to

a quick start, winning
their first three matches.

Rugby Team Splits I
Host Springfield Next

by Don Plum

The Albany State rugby team
split their ﬁrst two games of
the season. defeating Albany Med.
l2-8 and getting battered by Union.
30-0. -

Against Union, the Danes were
without IO starters due to injuries,
personal problems and the mini-I
vacation. Officers Don Rossi and'
Gary Boccio felt that the newcomers
tothe club learned quite a bit last
Saturday.

Union picked up two quick scores
early in the first halfas Don Tedesco
and Garth Boone rambled 27 and 43

yards. respectively. and Union led 8-0.

The Dutchmen‘s Joel Koral pick-
ed up a loose ball and raced 79 yards
for a score. The PAT attempt by A.

l. Czarnupal was good and Union
was 'ahead [40 at the half.
The second'half belonged entirely
to Tedesco and Boone as each picked
up two more scores to give Union an .
insurmountable 30-0 lead with
eight minutes left in the game.

Against Albany Med. the Danes
led at the haIfB—O on scores by Jimbo
Nyemchek on an assist from Andy
Lee. and Dave Thomson who dove
on a loose ball following a blocked
kick bv Boccio.

Albany picked up another score
early in the second hall on a line run
by Wences Rodriguez which covered
23 yards. Albany Med. struck back
late in the second halfwith two quick
scores by Bob "Basset Hound“
