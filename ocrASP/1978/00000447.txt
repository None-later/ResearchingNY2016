Driving down the thruway on
their way to Albanygthe Maryland-
based Towson State football squad
is sure to see a sign that states: Do
Not Pass. They will probably ignore
it though, because the Tiger's for-
midable aerial show cannot he
stopped by a mere warning.

Headed by their sensational
quarterback Ron Meehan (ti‘J“.l9tl)
l‘owson brings to University Field a
passing attack that can bring op-
posing defenses to their knees. it will
be Meehan‘s accurate right arm that
tltc Danes. who defeated llrockport
last week. will have to key on
tomorrow afternoon at l:3tl p.m..

"He's the best college quarterback
I‘ve ever seen." said Danes coach
Mike Walsh. who scouted 'I'owsoii
last week. “He‘s got Division ltalerit
and he‘s it probable pro prospect.”

Mechan's heroics arc the main
reason for the Tigers quick J-l start.
the gifted sophomore has am sed
somceye-opening statistics in his first
four games after starting as a
freshman last sc 'on. In completing
()0 percent of his tosses (bl~|f)2)
Meehan has distanced an incredible
K70 yards.

Last week. Meehan singlehargded—
ly destroyed (iuilford College with a
routinely superb performance. He
completed l9 of 29 passes for 230
yards, leading 'l'owson to a 3l-22
triumph.

“On defense, we must be able to
contrrl their first down
situations.“said Albany head coach
Bob Ford. “If we can get them into
second and to situations we‘ll havea
better chance at containing their
passing attack.“

Teaming up with Meehan to form
a dynamic combination is
sophomore Ken Snoots (6‘3".205).
After sitting out last year with a knee
injury. Snoots is making up for lost
time this season. He has 29 recep-
tions for 5]? yards in his four starts.
making for more than 129 yards per
game catching the ball. a statistic an
entire team could be proud of.

A week ago Snoots broke open the
(iuilford secondary for six catches
good for 92 yards.’ In addition. the

hiiied for a 70-yard touchdown
bomb earlier this season.

“He‘s a Division I ballplayer." said
Walsh. “He' can get himself open.
he‘s got good hands; plus he‘s fast."

Another quttlity receiver in the
Tigers Pro I setup is split end
Terry Beck (6‘3".200). The senior had
four receptions last week.

“Our defensive halfbacks. Rich
Ileiiiicrlc and Daryl llaynor. will
have to play a vital role in stopping
their passing attack.“ said Ford.
"liiit we also must be able to generate
a pass-rush. Meehan isthc finest pure
thrower we‘ve seeri, and we will
probably have to give Snootsspccial
attention on third-down plays."

“liven if a team can do one thing
very well. it is still easy to defend
against," added Ford. “It's the teams

llic other standout on the offense

Walsh.

Hungry Danes Prey On Brockport St. 42-28

by David ()shorn

Question: What happens when a
college football tcunt boards a
iiiodcrniled chartered bus and is
pleasantly enroute to an away game

rumbling along a state highway
when they encounter trouble coni-
mon to all travelers; the bus breaks
down'.’

The answer. as put by Albany
State defensive. coach Jack

(Sedlicki. was adopted from a
life situation. “We jtist sat around
and read. slept or ate. Someone sent
for candy bars and they were
gobbled up,“ he said. “After a while
we all got a little bored and we
started naming the teams of schools;
we must have gone through the eti-
tirc country.“

After a three-hourwait. the Danes
were able to continue the journey

and iieverstopped rttnning until they
had soundly defeated the (iolden
liagles 42-28 last Saturday night.

the victory iticreased Albany‘s
season mark to 2-l coming on the
heels of last Week‘s wiii over
Southern Connecticut. Once again.
the offensive line cleared the path for
the Dane wishbone attack and
allowed the running backs to
seampcr for yardage with a frequen-
cy that was at times awesome.
Albany accumulated 4l| yards on
the ground in the game.

llroekport had a large but rather
stationary defense. A simple nudge
by a Datie lineman was enough to
spring the Albany backs into the
secondary and they responded in
earnest. Fullback Mike Mirabella
galloped through the Eagle defense
like a pri/ed jumping colt and gar-
nered a personal best of 206 yards on
I‘) carries and two touchdowns.

“Our offensive line just had

another great game led by the center
.lolin l)‘Anna." Mirabella. the senior
from Utica. said. “They were
phenomenal all the way down the
line and it was a pleasure to run
through those holes they opened up.
Coach Ford wanted to establish the
inside and outside game and both
worked very well; they couldn‘t stop
us."

the outside member of that for-
mula was halfback Levi Louis. Com-

and occasionally taking that route
himself. Louis rushed for more than

ed the game with l38 and three

for.

“When you run the wishbone you
try to take what the defense is willing
to give you." said Danes‘ head coach
liob Ford. "In the first halfthey were
giving its several openings for the
halfback and Levi ran well. Mike

was excellent in that second lialfund
he blocked particularly well for Levi
iii the first half.“

llrockport was led by art unex-
pected starting back, Dwight Slater.
on a chilly evening at Brockport
High School. The site contained
lights needed for the nightime con-
test, and Slater possessed startling
raw speed as he surprised the Albany
defenders by racing for 156 yards
and three touchdowns on a mere [3
carries.

Slater's meandering running style
in the fourth period led a surge that
heightened the drama for Eagle fiins
after their team entered the final
qtuirter trailitig 21-6. Ford installed
several substitutes on defense and
Slater‘s 74-yard scoring run lifted
Brockport emotionally, as a wild
qtiartcr saw three touchdowns by
each side.

had looked impressive. Dave Mathis

Booters Outhustle Binghamton 3-1

by Davld Spiro

A cold. rainy and wet field provid-
ed the setting for what may well be
the beginning of a turnaroun for the
better by the Albany State varsity

defeating liiiighamton J~l.

The win. iit what Albany head

coach Bill Schieffelin described as

“one of the key games of the year."
kept alive the Danes hopes of
qualifying for the NCAA Division
III playoffs.

the game started out poorly for
the Danes iii the first half as they
continued to be plagued by offensive
problems. The half ended with
Albany trailing t-0 after a Bingham-

ton forward drilled a goal past
Danes' goalie Dario Arango at
[0:20 of the first half.

“I thought the first half was
horrendous.“ said Schicf'fclin. “We
played terrible." The Dane offense
had trouble getting uiitracked for the
entire first half and the team‘s play
seemed lackadaisical and un-

inspired.

llowetei'. as bad as the Danes'
play was in the first half, their play in
thc second half was as good or better
than it has been all season. At half-
ltime. Scliiel‘felin made two player
changes, putting Jimmy Alverel
into the game at forward and

Afrin Nezaj into the right half-

back position. According to

Scliieffelin. these two players helped

to spark the teain and both

of them did a "very out-
. standing job.“

The “biggest spark ofall," accor-
ding to Schielfelin was backf'ielder
Kirk Andrews. At 22:35 of the se-
cond half. Andrews drove a goal into
the liinghamton net after a Danes‘
corner kick. llic boot by Andrews

ed to change the whole complexion
ot' the contest. Albany‘s
aggressiveness began to dominate
the game.

At 3l:lll Andrews connected
again. this time on a pass from
Carlos Arungo. Arango kicked the
ball in lroiit of the net and Andrews
flicked it above the arms ofthc lung-

O’Lcary Isilnaugurated
At Weekend Ceremony

by Thomas Martello

In a ceremony mixed with for-
mality and humor. Vincent O‘Leary
was inaugurated as SUNYA‘s
fourteenth president Saturday night
in the Campus Center Ballroom.

The inauguration ofﬁcially gave
O‘Leary the position of leading
SUNYA --a job he was drafted for
by a presidential search committee
five months ago ~— cven though he‘
had declared himself a non-
candidate.

People from all walks ofSUNYA
life were gathered in the packed
Ballroom to witnessthe event. Along
with the usual collection of ad-
ministrators. faculty members and
students were dignitaries of the
education world. members of the
Albany community. as well as
SUNYA bus drivers and cafeteria
workers.

The mix of the crowd and the at-
times light tone of the ceremony
seemed fitting for O‘Leary. it man
who dined with students on the quad
while Acting President last year.

The Ballroom lights dimmed at
about 8:30 p.m. and the ceremony
began with classical music and a
procession which included visiting
college presidents; SUNYA vice
presidents deans and department
chairs; SUNY vice chancellors'. and
featured speakers, all clad in
academic robes. At the end of the

processionwas O‘Leary, who smiled
and winked at the crowd of nearly
600.

The procession reached the front
of the ballroom, which was dressed
up for the occasion. Donald New-

man. who succeeded O'beary as .

Dean of the School of Criminal
Justice. made some opening
remarks; directly after which came
the invocation by Rev. Howard J.
Hubbard. Bishop of the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Albany.

After that came a battery of
speakers. all with kind things to say
about the new president.

The ﬁrst to speak was University
Community Council Chair Thomas
Whalen, who was followed by Chair
of the Faculty on the University
Senate Francine Frank.

Frank said that she was pleased to
have someone from the faculty rise
to the position of president. She
mentioned that the last faculty
member to become president at
Albany was Joltn Sayles (after
whom Sayles Hall was named). who
took over iit l94l.

SA President Paul Feldman said
that the inauguration afforded hima
unique situation 7 r it was probably
the only time where he could speak
to members of the SUNYA and
SUNY administration collectively.
Feldnian then added, “ln light of
this. l have a list of student

toilet paper. drawing laughs from
the audience.

Praise of O‘Leary came from
SUNYA Alumni President Anthony
C: ale. who called O'Leary‘s role
last year as “action president. not ac-
titig president". Other accolades
came from Commissioner of Educa-
tion (iordoii Ainbach, a letter from
(iovernot‘ Hugh Carey and a tardy
Albany Mayor Erastus Corning.

it will be funded entirely out of
SUNY students‘ tuition payments.
According to Allinger. Carey‘s
visible anger at the meeting‘s com-
mencement was caused by reading a

gory in the Oct. 6th edition of the

.4 SP. concerning the demonstration
planned by SASU. just moments
before entering the conference.

“I‘ve read that some, I guess
you‘ve heard, plan to picket Eagle
Street to let me know how you feel
about paying $17." Carey reported
in an offended tone. “You want to
get the elected overwhelmingly? You
go ahead and picket Eagle Street,
and I‘ll go out and be it dcmagogue
and say ’l think every studentshould

“So what do I want? I want a foun-
