  Arrest. ‘

Alumni Harass'riient Suspect

by Steve Outer. - I

SUNYA police have arrested a
man in connection with incidents of
sexual and criminal

trespass on Alumni Quad,according .

to Investigator John l-Iayner.

Hayner said that Alvin W. Dubois ‘
Jr.. 22, a white male who was ap- '

prehended_ last Friday, was
“positively ID‘d by a witness to a
criminal trespass on the quad two
weeks ago."

University Police are still
searching for a black man or men
who reportedly walked into several
girls‘ showers, bathrooms and dorm
rooms, and in one instance “actually
grabbed a [showering] female" ac-
cording to Hayner.

He said that Dubois is being
charged with sexuaiabuseinthe first
degree, which is a felony, as well as
criminal trespassing the second
degree. a misdemeanor.

The first charges stem from‘a coin-
plaint filed by a Waterbury Hall
woman who allegedly was harassed
outside her dorm. “He grabbed her

'and physically abused her," said

llayner, "and she is pressing
charges." lie said that. if convicted.

Dubois faced “hard time, not‘one of
those 30-day sentences."

The criminal trespass charge. ﬁled
by SUNYA, alleges that Dubois
entered a Waterbury Hall Women's
bathroom and crawled under an oc-
cupied stall.

Hayner said that three witnesses
identified Dubois as being the
perpetrator of the incidents. One, a
Waterbury Hall RA who
acknowledged seeing him "on the
third floor," refused further com-
ment. saying that she was “advised
not to say anything aboutthe case."

Hayner said that Dubois un-
derwent a pre-trial hearing yester-
day. and would probably be brought
up before a grand jury in the near
future. ,

“The hearing is kind of a rap ses-
sion before the big meeting.“ he ex-
plained. “The evidence available is
reviewed . . . to see il we have
enough to go to trial."

Cronin agreed, saying, “Basicauy
the anti-grouping ordinance is
designed forintimidation. the cityof
Albany is attempting to tell students

Both Cronin and Kelson fccllhe
best way to deal with the abuses of
the anti-grouping ordinance is to
push for repeal. “Students should

’O’Leary Is Inaugurated asS’lﬂVYA ’sPreside‘nt

t‘unlinucrl from page one

the on-campus unrest which was
prevalent in the l960‘s, Blinken
related that an escape hatch was
devised for the SUN YA president‘s
office, just in case students decided
to take over the administrative
wings.

“Hopefully. you won‘t be needing
this." Blinken quipped. “But if you
do, don‘t call me. call my wife.“

At about 9:00 p.m.. SUNY
Chancellor Clifton Wharton walked
to the podium. After praising
O‘l.eary as tin-administrator with a
combination of wisdom and humor,
Wharton presented O‘Leary withthe
SUNY medallion, “a symbol of ex-
cellence". And by the virtue of the
authority invested in him, Wharton
officially installed O'Lcary as the
fourteenth president of SUNYA.

O‘Leary was then called upon to
speak, and was greeted by warm
applause. His speech was peppered
with a few jokes, but for the most
part encompassed a historical look
at the evolution of SUNYA and
higher education in America.
O‘Leary also talked of the view ofa
higher education today: ‘f . . . .
Should the undergraduate years
provide specialized trainingaimcd at
any one of a thousand destinies. or
an education for a common heritage
and toward a common citizenship?
 There are choices to be made."
he said.

O'Leary continued by saying that
he does not believe that universities
should ignore legitimate career con-
cerns of students, but "I do believe
that we need to capture more of the
coherence of the intellectual tradi-

tion that was so much a part of this
institution in its first century . . . "
O‘Lcary said thatwhen he decided
to accept the presidency last spring
that he was “genuinely moved bythe
expressions of support and by the
growing vitality and shared loyalties
which can be felt on this campus."
‘He said that when someone asked
him about the days ahead for
SUNYA, whether or not the major
problems were behind this
university, he replied that “ . . . no
person can expect to live a life
without problems, nor can a
University in the l980's, certainly
not one in the State of New York.
expect to escape them." I
He added, “The measure of the
character of a human being is scaled
not by the avoidance of burdens in
one's life, but rather by how those

burdens are confronted. It is no less
with a university."

After his speech, O'Leary was
once again greeted by warm
applause from the people assembled
in the Ballroom. There is something
to be said about those people; they
represented just about every con-
stituency from SUNYA. The
decisions oflhc president will affect
all of those constituencies;
sometimes those decisions will
benefit one constituency at the ex-
pense of another. With budgetary
problems always present in higher
public education, a president's pop-
ularity is always subject to low
points. Priorities will have to be set,
and it will be hard to please
everyone.

But an inauguration is not a time
to highlight the negative. and
()‘Leary‘s pledge to keep this place
“first and foremost as a University.a
place of freedom. a place committed

was just the kind of pledge the people
wanted to hear.

So as the procession toward the
exits ended the ceremony, the people
in the ballroom applauded — they
applauded for O'Leary. and also for
SUNYA and its future. O'Leary
walked at the end of the procession,
ofﬁcially the Fourteenth president of
SUNYA. committed to tackle the
problems that face this university.

And amid the applause, Vincent
O‘Leary once again smiled and
winked at the crowd.
