ment a great deal of work goes in to
attaining such a result.

O‘Leary brought up the possible
SUNY-CU NY merger and how it
would affect the SUNY system
ﬁnancially. if indeed as Mayor Koch
stated. New York City will no longer
support approximately 25 percent of
the CUNY budget. O'Leary raised a
question about where the missing 25
percent would come from. While
there has - been no building at
SUNYA since 1968. O‘Leary added
the city boasts building cost needs at
$100 billion. According to O'lxary.
former U.S. Education Com-

missioner Howe, who at this time is
doing a study of New York. indicates
that there will be “heavy pressure for
the State of New York to increase its
funding of the CUNY system."
Undergraduate Education and ad-

  

visement. O'Leary said, are two of
his highest priorities. “We are mov-
ing sharply forward in getting a
hold of our advisement and im-
proving it." He said that he has been
discussing the subject of how to ap-
proach the issue of undergraduate
teaching with the Educational
Policies Council.

On the graduate level he placesthe
importance on the programs offered
and the State Education Review
Department. The Sociology and
Political Science doctoral programs
were reviewed thissemcster and next
year The School of Education's 3|0
programs will be reviewed.

O'l.eary went on to explain the
trek by the administration towards
more effective budget and planning.
lie spoke of the development of the
mission statement followed by the

Three Year Plan and how the Three

Year Plan was transformed into a
series of annual statements about
where the programs are going.
After O‘Leary's speach. Un-
dergraduate Academic Committee
member Harold Howes. announced
the Undergraduate Academic Coun-
cil by Oct. 18. It was therefore stated
that the need for a special Senate
meeting on October 30, due to the
resignation of chair-person elect

Bruce Marsh, announced earlier by'

Senate Chair Francine Frank, might
be supplemented by the neccessity of
quick action concerning the En-
viornmcntal Study Program.
Howes contined by telling the
various issues which were or would
be before the UAC. such as
