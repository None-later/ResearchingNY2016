FROG FRENZY

The Government of India has
sharply cut down on that country’s
export of frog's legs. because of a
frogi shortage and a possible insect
problem in India.

India has been exporting more
than 3000 tons of the edible
delicacies annually, but exports are
now being banned during the frog-
breeding season.

Scientists in India have been war-
ning that the frogs there are being
depleted and that this could lead to
an insect infestation. According to
their calculations. each jumping
amphibian consumes about 5000 in-
sects a month. With the frogs
diappearing. they warn. the insects
are slowly taking over.

reports that studies conducted by his
office involving the Rockland Psy-

Developmental Center showed that
"many" of the patients who died at
these institutions were tranquilized
to the point that they were unable to
feel pain that could have warned
them they were ill.

He added that most of the deaths
his office studied showed the
patients died as a result ofvomitting
into their lungs. Certain ne ves

charged that often doctors prescribe

The drugs most commonly used at
the hospitals were thorazine. haldol.

years been aware of the possible
health hazards of cadmium-tainted
lettuce being imported from Califor-
nia. but so far. has done nothing
about the problem,

The newspaper claims un-
published studies by the University
ot' California at Davis have also
turned up “very high concen-
trations" of cadmium in other
vegetables imported from the major
crop growing regions in central
California.

One Chicago researcher said he
asked FDA officials what they in-
tended to do about the cadmium in
California lettuce. Tieir answer. The
Sun Times report: was that they'
"don" think the p oblem deser 'es
{hulklnd ofattent in."

VIRGIN DEBBIE

ls virginity still a relevant issue for
young women? Singer Debbie
Boone thinks so.

In fact. Pat Boone‘s 2l-year-old
daughter has even gone so far as to 
explain her feelings about her own I
virginity in the latest issue of Red-
baok magazine, in an article titled -  '
“The Case ForlYirginity."

' Says Debbie Boone, "I happen to a

I‘m as normal as anybody.“

TROPICAL HELMET ’ «

Scientists in the Netherlands
claim, after years of research, they
have stumbled on the perfect crash
helmet for motorcyclists: It‘s a
coconut.

Researchers at the National
Center for Applied Scientific
Research in Delft say they have dis-
covered lhat a coconut shell absorbs i
shocks far better than any other i
crash helmet designed by engineers.

The scientists say they are now try-
ing to devise a plastic with a libered
structure similar to the coconut
which could he used in the mass
production of better crash helmets.
