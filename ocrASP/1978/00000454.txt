How are you‘.’ I know it‘s
been a while since I last wrote,
but I‘ve been a little busy. You
Won't believe it, but I've got a
new girlfriend named Regina and wc‘ye
been going out a lot. Come to thitik of it.
we‘ve been going to the same placcevery
night, a little bar on Madison Avenue
called the Partridge Pub.

M.J. Mommott

I think you would like it there. It‘s not
the busiest or the biggest bar around. but
it does have a certain identity ofits own.
The lights are low, and the beerflows
pretty freelyjust like most other bars. But
at the Partridge Pub. you usually don't
have to fight the long lines to the bar or
anywhere else for that matter. Now I
know you always liked a crowded bar
because that means more females will be
there, but once in a while everybody needs
a change.

It‘s great to go to a place where you can
actually hear the person across the table
when they talk. That‘s why Regina and l
have been going there. expecially on the
week nights. Then we can be sure it won‘t
be too loud tojust have a beer and talk.
I guess that's what ﬁrst attracted me to
the place. I remember it was a cool fall
evening during my freshman year. My
roommate and I were out surveying the
area around Alumni Quad. and we
stumbled onto The Pub. As I opened the
door and saw the long bar, the wooden
tables, and the panelling on the walls. I
knew immediately this place was alright.
You remember my roomate from that
year don‘t you? His name was AI
Sorentino and he was known around the
dorm as "Crasher." I never quite ﬁgured
out why he had that nickname, but it
might have had something to do with the
way he used to open doors.

Anyway. here we wcrc.just out of high
school and cruisitig around Albany
looking very cocky and confident. We
walked up to the bar and immediately got
proofcd. but forlutiately the bartender
nc\cr really looked at the birthdatc on my

ID. Otherwise I might be hanging out at a
different bar now.

Being very macho characters we
ordered shots of whiskey and proceeded
to gel. fairly drunk. I can still see
"Crasher" slumped under one of the
picnic tables they have in the back. Some
kind soul helped us get back to Pierce that
night, and also helped himself to my
wallet. But that‘s another story.

Since that time I must say my behavior
hasimproved when I've been at The Pub.
Sophomore year was spent mostly there
at night, looking at the color TV and the
girls that filter in and out.

But the best thing was that you could
talk withoutshouting. That is, it's the best
thing next to the burgers they serve. I can
remember that ﬁrst one I had with my
roommate like it wasjust yesterday. I hey
have to be the best bar burgers l‘vc e\er
had, and you know how many of those
I‘ve eaten in my life.

A bar is a place to go drinking though.
notjust to talk and eat. right? Like I said.
they've got beer, and plenty of it. lreally
go for t heir gin and tonics though. Iii fact.
that‘s the only kind ofdrink I‘ve ever had
there. But Regina says that the lllaek
Russians are excellent, and her lather

I Cody's fiend

he New Commander Cody

Band. who played Page Hall

Sunday night. was a solid and

well-played rock ‘n‘ roll show.

The Commander started the
set with a couple of older tunes to bring
the audience into the show, “Rock That
Boogie" and “Smoke, Smoke, Smoke.“
Alter establishing the tempo ofthe show,
the hand went into a series of new
standards for this tour. All the songs are
rock ‘n‘ roll with a couple ofthe band
members sharing lead vocals Although
they were able to handle the songs
effectively, the female vocalists who used
to perform with the "old" Commander
(.‘ody were sorely missed. The female
voices added a variety that is lost iti this
ggw hand.

Tony Tassarottl

[his is not to say that the new band is
poor, just a little different vocally. in fact
it is just as strong if not tighter musically.
llill Kirchcn was as great as ever on
electric lead guitar. and ex-LI’A tnenibcr
Rick Higgiii was quite effective on
rhythm guitar.

Most of the songs began with the entire
group playing and went on to include a
solo lead by each member. One of the
better ones was llill Kirchen's lead on
"Midnight in Memphis". Indeed, Kirchen
was the high point of the middle of the
show.

The ('ommandcr structures his
concerts similarly from one to the next.
The beginning third sees him playing it
few newer tunes, “Thank You Lone
Ranger“ " J “I Want a Rock ‘n' Roll
l’uneral When I Die“ with some of his
older favorites, "Rock That Boogie," and

 

“Smoke, Smoke, Smoke." After mixing it
in the beginning third. the middle is all
newer material in which attention is
focused on the different band members,
especially Bill Kirchen and Toby Johnson
(the drummer and writer ofthe songs). It
is this part of the concert that is the most
interesting. because it is here that
Commander Cody shows the new band‘s
direction. That direction is definitely that
of old—time rock ‘n‘ roll.

The final third is a return to the
material of older times and the old group,
the Lost Planet Airmen. It is in the final
part of the concert which generatbs the
tnosi interest and energy in the audience.
Among the favorites played, “Down to
Seeds and Stems Again Blues," “It
Should'vc Been Me" and “Hot Rod
Lincoln“. “ Hot Rod Lincoln“, a tale of a
degenerate, hippie punk racking across
California, being chased by the good
guys, the cops, the National Guard, the
Army, etc, is one of my personal
favorites and one of the more arousing
songs I‘ve seen iii concert. Mixed in with
these songs are a few newer songs that
blend in extremely well with the old—time
tunes.

“Stealin at the Seven Eleven," was
particularly well done, a song which the
Commander claims got him a lawsuit for
several million dollars. He has nrevinnslv
said that being charged $4.69 for a six
pack of Heineken prompted the song.
song.

These songs signaled the ending of the
concert. as they do with most of
Commander Cody‘s concerts. He
traditionally ends his concerts with “ Hot
Rod Lincoln,“ and oti Sunday limped

concert-goers were treated to
dual performances by rock‘s
own mustachioed master of the bizarre,
as Frank Zappa fired up the Palace
Theater for two shows last Sunday night.

Peter Sgourls
Beth Kaplan

That everting Zappa and his current
batch of Mothers were in good spirits and
top form. They performed a well
orchestrated, finely choreographed
repertoire of material in a number of
styles ranging from chamber to disco; all
in the mischievovsly mystical mood that
has kept Zappa notorious for almost two
decades,

liver the perfectionist, both
performances were flawless in several
aspects. The act was polished, the lighting
efﬁcient and the sound unblemished.
Zappa produced an on-stage sound
superior to that which many musicians
are capable to achieving in the studio.

I’rank's latest band is a tight, R & I)
based outfit who he has been working
with for about two years (including last
year‘s concerts in New York City). It was
the typical Zappa set, rather extensive:
guitar, slide, bass. keyboards, percussion,
drums, and the maestro himself. Each
band member put in an exceptionaleffort
with most performing solos and assisting
with vocals. Zappa has always played
with the best - Jean-Luc I’onty, George
Duke, Flo dc Eddie m and Sunday night
was no exception.

The show opened in a traditional
manner. The theatre grew dark as the
band put themselves into a rather

  

discordant theme. Then from stage left
emerged Frank Zappa, wielding a
screaming electric guitar. He took a
lengthy solo, with the band providing the
necessary background, before grabbing
the mic and saying, “Hello, folks!"

On stage Zappa possessed an air of
experience that only comes with many
long years of performing. Not only did he
play guitar and sing, but also he danced,
talked.joked and even shook a few hartds.
Ilis spontaenity of expression made
everyone feel at home.

Although he did not play guitar
throughout the show,when he did pick up
his axe the audience was mesmerized by

ottt with "Riot iii Cell Block #9“ into the
ever-popular “Lost in the Ozone.” During
the last couple of'songs, the audience was
tip and dancing and definitely did not
want the band to co.

Although I realiycnioycd Commander
Cody‘s last songs, the fact that they were
the ending numbers was annoying and
slightly depressing. especially becausethe
concert, although extremely well played,
was also very short; only a hour and
fifteen minutes long. This can probably

be attributed to the lack ofaudicnce at the
show. A crowd of a few hundred for any
concert, especially for a first-rate band, is
depressing and obviously not condUsive
to a long show.

It is a tribute to the band thateven with
such a dismal showing. they still played
Well. The show was great. the band was
together, and the audience. for its size,
was responsive. Add these factors
together, you get an excellent concert and
an excellent evening.

his awesome combination on ﬁngers and
ampliﬁcation. He projected up to the
standards the audience expected of him.
His opening solos and a later one on
“Maybe You Should Stay With Your
Mom" rated among the best of the
evening, with a quality consistant to any
appearing on his recent albums.

Zappa and his band performed a
considerable amount of their own
personal blend of rhythm and blues,
including (as aforementioned) a satire of
disco. Frank. in purple shirt, red shoes
and white pants tied at the ankles, danced
across the stage performing erotic poses
with a stalk of pampas grass. He

eventually had to ask the audience to
move back, since sotne were nearly on
stage with hitn. This was the Zappa they
had come to see.

The general lyrical content of much of
the music contained the usual sarcasm,
perversion and social commentary that
Zappa is known and loved for. Such
sardonic themes as “Dancin‘ Fool“,
“Keep It Greasy“, and uEasy Meat"
amused the audience.

He also took time to conduct
“Redunzl”, a rather orchestrated piece
which was. unfortunately, the onlything
he did from his new album Studio Ton.
This was hard-core Mothers of Invention
tnusic, reminiscent of Lumpy Gravy and
(lrtmrl Wazoo.

But the materials which most pleased
the audieticc were the standard Zappa
favorites. Amongihesc were an extended
Fingers“ (frotn his movie Zoo Motels),
and the classic saga of “Nanook the
Eskimo“, and “Don‘t Eat The Yellow
Snow."

“Yellow Snow" was the highlight ofthe
show. More dramatized than the album
version, it was during this number that
Frank evoked the greatest audience
response by asking that all participate in
pouncing on the furtrupper, an act of
jumping tip and down. To encourage
Iinvovement, he told the crowds, “If you
don‘t do it, you're an asshole. lfyou do,
you're only a jerk like me." Almost 3,000
rose to their feet and participated. To top
things off, there was a guest appearance in
the atidience by St. Alphonzo. The set
ended with some opera music.

Frank recieved an enthusiastic
standing ovation, complete with banners,
matches, shouts, and deafeningapplause.
