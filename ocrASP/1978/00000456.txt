or most people, bathroom

graffiti is a barely tolerable

rind even somewhat annoying

series of etchings and

obscenities. For others, it is a
socially acceptable outlet for anger and
literaryabnormalities. For me. bathroom
graffiti is a fascinating art form which
deserves at least some degree of studyand
academic r ‘

Bruce Fox

One of the most interesting realities
about this art form is that it tends to
develop a separate and distinct theme
from bathroom to bathroon, and indeed.
sometimes even from stall to stall. The
men‘s room in Dutch Quad's Flag room
serves as a wonderful place to begin our
research. Because ofthe fact that it‘s walls
have not been scrubbed for years. it serves
as an excellent archeological remnant of
SU NYA history. as well asa preservation
ground for those halcyon graffiti classics
gone by. flow can one help but be
nostalgic when one reads, “CD'I'A. no
way.“ “Do something for America.
castrate a Rockefeller." rind of course.
that golden oldie. “Here I sit. broken
hearted.“

The Dutch Quad men's room.
however. is best noted for its rampant
anti-semitism. Allow me to quote from
the stall nearest to the sinks:

“I can accept gays, though I am not a
redneck. bill I can‘t fathom Long Island
Jews, the fucking scum of the earth."

'l'liere are many other similar etchings.
of course. ()ne graffitiatician. for

example, wrote in the same stall:

"I’oor Jews are okay. Rich Jews are r "

Ile there leaves a series of blanks. in
which apprentice graffitiatieians
responded that rich Jews are. in fact:

”I) Sunny, 2) Ilomos. 3) St trek tip. and
4) Ariti-seinitie."

The Dutch men‘s room is not the only
literary success. however. Surprising as it
may seem. the biology building boasts
reams of very original iirid potentially
trend-setting jottings. “Why did the pre-
nied chicken cross the road? Because it
was required.  " is one excellent riddle
apparently conceived by someone who
calls himself the “lieefeater.”

There are other bathrooms. of course.

of inspirational value. but it should be
noted right now that there are just as
many which claim almost no literary
merit. Avid graffiti watchers will know
that I speak of the stalls in the chemistry.
physics, earth science, fine arts, and
administration buildings. These walls are
marked with almost nothing but clean.
blank spaces. and an occasional assertion
that some group or individual is known to
draw into the month by action ofthelips
and tongue. It is these sorts of stalls that
give graffiti it bad name.

Moving on to the PAC. we find the
perrenial favorite. “Liszt Piszt here and
Miszt." State Quad exhibits tremendous
hostility toward homosexuals, sporting
proclamations to "exterminate gay
people now!“ The business building‘s
bathroom says that the world blows but
Albany State sucks. so the pressure is
equalized. And in this same stall we find
the first
mysterious etchings discovered around
campus the razor-bladed signature of
Marcus Cunnilingus.

But who is this Cunnilingus? And why
has he spent so much time carving his
name into nearly every stall west of the
bell tower? Is it fanaticism? Or simply a
desire to leave a mark on the school? We
can't know for sure. Recent research
reveals that there is no person named
Cunnilingus on file in the school records.
lissentially. then. the Cunnilingus
controversy is doomed to remain a
mystery for many years to come.

Saving the best for last. it is my
considered judgment that. by far. the
finest source of consistently excellent
graffiti on this campus is the second floor
library men‘s room. N 0 description on my
part could ever do justice to the masterful
techniques displayed in these stalls. It is
bathroom literature at its best,along with
one of t he most original innovations ever
conceived by a graffitiatician ~ the Mad
Crosser Outer. who renders unto each
sprawl a traiisiusceiit covering of lines
and asterisks. I must encourage everyone
within eyeshot to go to the libraryas soon
as possible to witness this marvelously
imaginative work. (io. before they start
charging admission! (io. before the long

U.N.Y. Albany's seventh
annual Community University

Day, held on Saturday.
October 7th, was a complete
success. People began to

wander into the uptown campus where
the event tooklplace around “:00, and
soon the podium was crowded with
visitors. People of all ages, from
grandparents to young children. were all
over the uptown campus like so many
ants on a cupcake. Everyone enjoyed the
free balloons that were given out at the
Campus Center and, on the whole, were

In the Lecture Centers, dubbed by a
visitor as “where it‘s at,“ many things
were going on. In the large lectures rooms
themselves all sorts of exhibits and
programs. reflecting what the University
has to offer. were being viewed. But the
place to be was in the hallway, where one
found a great assortment of cultural
foods and displays. Free snacks were
being given out at some exhibits by a
group which represents many
nationalities; the LACE (Language and
Culture in Education). One could sample
anything from pumpkin pie to pigeon
peas and rice at various tables crowded
with food and explanatory pamphlets.
Inquisitive Visitors could even get crash
courses in languages like Swahili.

()n balance, the Computer Center
proved to be the most interesting place.
Everyone marvelled at a display screen

Admidst all this hustle-bristle. many
opinions were being formed about the
University. ()n the one hand. some said
that the University should reach out into
the community riiore often, that it should
more frequently invite the public in and
put more effort into advertising its events.
()tlicr's thought. conversely. that
S.U.N.Y.A. has always been good to the
public. trying hard to let people know
about the courses and exhibits that it
provides.

I he one point everyone agreed on was
that the architecture of the University is
stunning. though to many unfamiliar
eyes. the layout was confusing. But the
girided tours given every hour were very
informative and helped end much ofthe
confusion.

Clearly. then. on this year‘s
Community University Day. the general
public became better acquainted with
Albany State and its many facets. A good
time was had by all, and SUNYA‘s
outreach to the community was a great

While the quality of some concerts
