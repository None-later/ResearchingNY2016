Return With us now to baseball’s
history. a happier time. when The
Yankees weren't down twa nothing.
And tonight. during the commer-
cials. you can look over these ten
bafﬂing questions, to either forget
the misery or enhance the victory.
whatever the case may be. And the
case had better be victor y. Good luck.

I. Who was the last pitcher (current-
I y hurling for the Yanks) to pitch a
perfect game in the major leagues?
2. 0n the subject of perfect games,
who made the last out of Don
Larsen's perfect World Series game
in I956."

3. Two Yankee batters rank second
and third in career strikeouts. Who
are they?

4. Which Yankee has the distinction
of being the only player in major
league history to end a World Series
being caught attempting to steal a
base."

5. Who. was the last Yankee to hit a
home run in the old Yankee
Stadium.”

b. What was the count on Mickey

Mantle when he hit his 500th career
home run?

7. Which Yankee holds the
.‘lltll'l‘ft'llll League record for most
sacriﬁce/lies in a reason."

it. What hatter crawled hack into the
dugout after popping up one of
Steve Hamilton's famous ‘ffo/Iy
//ooter.\'"."

it. li’hose record/or most RHI‘s ina
[ire gunu' World Series did Reggie
Jackson beat /tt.\'i year?

ll). Who lost the last game of the
season — and the pennant —for the
I 904 American lxague lt'llttl in New
York on it wild pitch.” And what was
the name of that team." (later to

Out 01 Pep

To the Editor:

Often enough. students at this university are
criticized as being apathetic. uninvolved and
down-right disinterested with all school
related events. An event occurred this
weekend which, at ﬁrst glance. seems to
conﬁrm this viewpoint. However. before
someone jumps on the soapbox proclaiming
the laziness of 'the student body. we feel a
closer look is necessary. .

For those of you who were wondering what
that small number of people with thrc'c ﬂoats
were doing on Perimeter Road early Saturday
afternoon . . . THAT (believe it or not) was
our Homecoming'Paradc. For a university of
over 15.000 students —3 ﬂoats, the Pop Bank.
and the cheerleaders — is certainly not a very
good turnout. Many may immediatelyjump
to the previously mentioned conclusion of
apathy on the part of the other students.
however. this is not the case. The Pcp Band
llnd the cheerleaders began a long fight at the
end ofthc last year to take over the heading of
the parade from the R.A.'s. They feltthntthcy
could do a much bcttcrjob of reaching all the
students and getting them all involved. Well.
they ﬁnally won the fight. and the parade was
taken away from the R.A.'s and given to the
chccrlcudcrs and Pep Band. Their work on the
parade produced publicity that was so poor.
that it bordered on disaster. There were no
intcrcst meetings held on the quads. as had
hccn done in the past. Thcrcwcre onlytwo ads
in the ASP — one which appeared in the
Friday issue before the long weekend. and the
second appeared the day before the parade.
Our group. which did have a ﬂoat in thc
purudc. had to actively seek out the
cheerleaders to ﬁnd out the first place. We
lulkcd to many students Saturday afternoon
who told us that they didn‘t even know that
lhcrc was a parade. and that if they had they
would have been involved.

So this was deﬁnitely not a case of student
apathy. lfthc leadership had planned properly
this past weekend‘s Homecoming Parade
would have been as successful as the previous
years' parades. with many ﬂoats and a large
number of marchers. instead. this year‘s
parade turned out to be the worst
Homecoming Parade this university has seen
in years. And it seems ironical to us. that the
people who were in charge ofthc parade (and
its failure) are the some people who profess to
be the biggest proponents of school spirit.
Maybe in the future it wouldbc better ifthcy
stuck to their pom-poms, and gave the rest of
the student body an equal opportunity to
show that we have as much school spirit as
they do. Maybe then. we would have a
Homecoming Parade that the entire university
commununity could take part in and be proud
of.

Thanks in Order

To the lidltor:

This is in recognition and appreciation of
him: Quad SUNYA‘s ambulance service. 1
was recently injured during an intramural
softball game, with u dislocated shoulder. The
umbuluncc was on the scene within ﬁve
minutes. Although my teammates nor the
officials were not sure what to do. the
appearance oft he ambulance squad scemcdto
quiet everybody down. 1 was inside the
ambulance and quickly on my way to Albany
Mcd. Concurn for my comfort was the one
thing the Fch Quttd people showed me there
was plenty of. With an injury. that can both:
one thing that‘s most important: it was for me
then.

The shoulder is getting butter and 1 have
l-‘ivc Quad to thank for some of that. Special
thank you to Mike. Amy. and agood driver.

Larey’s Rotten Apple

So Governor Carey. as expected, will push for the repeal of the health
fee in 1979-80. That is a victory, we are told, because the fell will no
longer be charged to SUNY students without going to health services.
How much of a victory really is this? One key facmr is that the health
fee will be repealed in the ﬁscal year I 979-80. That means thatthe health
fee, which the politicians promised to be past history a year ago, will
make it through this year unscathed. So. for two years SUNY students
have been paying a fee which is bogus. for two years SUNY students
needing ﬁnancial aid have not been able to use TAP or any other aid
program in order to lessen the bite of the_ fee. . .

However, with Governor Carey double-talking at his best with
student leaders on Sunday. it is unclear where the money for his newly ;
proposed student health plan will come from, and how much will
actually go to student health serviced. A tuition hike -— because of some
potentially bogus heal services fee of the future —- is a definite
possibility. ' .

At, the "outset of this meeting with the student legtde'rs. Carey
challenged them on the possibility of a health: foe protest at the
Governor‘s mansion. He sﬁidsuch pro-student things as “You go" out
and picket Eagle Street, and_1'1l go out and be}: dcmgogue afngtsay 1
think e'vc_ry student should pay $173 You can go out and 6am it'pi‘éking ‘
applps if you can't earn it some other way." ..

Atter that. the Governor somehow attempted to equate problems in

1121mm with the health fee' -— more double-talk.

So_ hare is the situation in a nutshell: V

_9Carey says he will repeal the health fee —— but it hasn’t as of yet been
repealed. . ' _

OAnothcr fee, or “health plan” has been proposed by Carey. and it is
unclear whether this will cause a tuition incrcise.

0 I_ne healthfce which waspaid' by SUNY students and admitted to
being Wrong by ofﬁcials and politicians will not be refunded. In short.
the students pay ior the politicians’ mistakes. '

_A11 of‘thishgr'idwc’re told that it is a student victory. Now how do you ‘

39333”??? and SUNYA . ‘

President O’Leary’s inauguration on Saturday gives members of' ﬂu
SUNYA community a time to reﬂect upon what has happened and will
happen to this University. The past has such unpleasant eventsisuchas
retrenchments, PhD cuts and Psychology scandals.  have looked
a lot more optimistic this year, but problems still abound.

The future, with even more budgetary constraints, can possibly be .
difficult. At this point Vince O’Leary has all constituents of SUNYA in
his corner as he works toward rebuilding and shaping the future of this
institution. A united effort by all of the factiom here is essential if
0’ Leary is to succeed. ' ' i
