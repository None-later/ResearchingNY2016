Meehan looked for his big-play
receiver Snoots in the endzone, and
twice defensive halfback Daryl
Haynor made touchdown savtng

deflections.

“They ran a lot of timing
patterns,“ explained Sedlicki. “To
stop them We hit their receivers atthe
line to break up some of the timing.
The key was, though, that we kept on
changing defenses. If we stayed In
our base defense they would have
blowu us apart."

Albany also relied on a pass rush
that was "adequate," according to
Sedlicki. In contrast to Smith‘s three
quarterback sacks (“I wanted to put as
much pressure on Meehan that I
could“), was the appreciated work of
the Danes' superior defensive tackle
Dave Mathis.

“they had two guys picking me
up." said Mathis. “and when that
happens, someone on our line has
got to be free. I had him (Mcehan)
once though, but he got away. That
kinda ticked me off."

Concentrating so heavily on stop-

ping the pass, the Danes almost
forgot about the Tigers‘ two talented
runners. Tailback Tom Jones led
Towson with an even I00 yards in 24
carries, while fullback Rick Bielski
added 56.

“I think we underestimated their
runners," said Mathis. "We figured
we could stop them, but they had us
worried for a while.

In gaining their third straight vic-
tory, the Danes continued to move
up the field with their runsorienled
wishbone offense. Fullback Mike
Mirabella again was the workhorse.
as the rugged performer carried for
I25 of his squad‘s 392 rushing yards.

Mirabella charged up the middlcand
continaully had to be brought down
in the Tiger backfield.

As in the past, the one blemish on
the Danes oifensivc showing was
their willingness to cough up the
football. IzigIIl times the brill was
knocked from Albany hands intothc
Iree-I‘or-all territory. A second
quarter fumbled snap Irom center
.lohn D‘AIIIIII to Aldrich was the

team‘s 29th miscue of the still~young
season. It was these execution mis-
takes that brought Walsh in for
Aldrich to start the second half.

“We fumbled three quarterback-
center exchanges in the first half,"
explained Danes‘ head coach Bob
Ford. “We just can‘t have that."

With Walsh at the helm, Albany
put 24 points on the board and mov-
ed the ball with seeming case when
they had to. The slight (5‘9", I75)
lefthander completed three passes
for 55 yards, and his agile running
that accounted for the same amount
gave the University Field fans cause
for applause.

“Once we got it going," said
Walsh, “we felt we could run
anything and they couldn‘tstop us."

The last time these two teams rrict
it was Albany that couldn‘t stop
I'owson. The year was I970, the
Danes‘ first season as a club sport.
and the Iigcrs scored It humiliating
(I9-I41rouncing. Times have certain-
ly changed since then, and after the
team effort the Danes showed
against 'l'owson, it seems that it is
Albany that is ready to do some
Irouncing of their own.

"They don‘t look tremendous in a
scouting report, but thatdoesn't take
into account those added variables,"
Zaloom explained. “They are a
young bunch, rather inexperienced,
but they believe in themselves and
,they show an awful lot of poise late
in a game for such a young team."

Shane Currey, a freshman, is their
most impressive defensive standout.
In Buffalo‘s opening two games, the
line backer made I5 unassisted
tackles and intercepted a pass. “He
has good speed and strength and l
was impressed by his ability to read
the offense against Canisius and pur~

- sue the play,“ said Zaloom.

In the 5-2 Bull defense, Mark
I)il:rancesco plays the other
linebacker position, and while lack-
ing {‘urrcy‘s prowess he gives Buf—
I'IIlo a solid Iincbacking corp.
Defense tackle Larry Rothman
(6‘2". 230) spearheads the front wall
and Zaloom tabbed him “an
aggressive ballplaycr who moves
well to the ball."

While Rothman shines above his
Ii ncmates, they area hustlinglot that

Youth is truly the mark of the
Bulls. aIId a soph, Ken Keatingtb'l“,

I I75) plays a galvanizing strong safe-

ty‘despite his tender age. Intercep-
tion totals are low since all of Buf-
falo’s foes have been running teams,
but Zaloom called them capable.
Brian‘Schmidt, a frosh. plays the free
safety slot and the cornerbacks alter-
nate continuously.

Quatrani is a deﬁnite break away
threat on kickoffreturns and Albany
will have to heéd the receiver on
special teams. Steve Pollack
provides the Bulls with an excep-
tional panting ,weapon and can
average 35 yards a game, said
Zaloom. The special teams makethc
big play also and they recovered key
onside kicks in both comeback vic-
tories. '

“We certainly can't take Buffalo
too lightly, especially since this will
be their homecoming game and
they’re usually a spirited bunch
anyway.“ Zaloom commented. “We
have to go up there and play as we‘re
capable of playing. They can be aw—
fully surprising and you can't fall
asleep on them or they‘llstingyou."
