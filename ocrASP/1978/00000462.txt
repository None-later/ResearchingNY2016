Union Dampens BooterS’, Chances

by David Spiro .

The Albany State varsity soccer
team' suffered a major setback in
their drive for an NCAA Division III
playoff berth, as they were defeated
at Union College Tuesday, 4-3.

The loss came in the wake of one
of the Danes’ biggest victories ofthc
year. a 2-l win Saturday at
Brockport. The win and the loss left
Albany with a record of 3-4-2 with
five more games left to play.

Bil Disappointment

“Tuesday‘s game was a big disap-
pointment.“ said Albany head coach
llill Schicficlin. After the Brockport
win. in addition to last Wednesday's
triumph over Binghamton. the
Danes seemed ready to put it all
together and forge a long winning
slrcltk to put them right into the
playoffs. However. this was not to be
as the unranked Union team was
able to beat the Danes. who had
come into the game tied for fifth in
the stale.

Albany jumped off to a quick l-0
lead when Afrim chaz booted in a
goal at l2: l 7 ofthc first half. but Un—
ionanswcrcd back with goalsofthcir
own at 30: It) and 3K220 to take a 2-l

halftime lead.

Union opened the second half
scoring at |2:l7 to make it 3-1. but
Datrcs‘ forward Carlos Arango kick-
ed one in at 3|:39 to make it 3—2. At
$04220 Union scored again opening
the lead to 4-2. Albany cut the lead to
one when Jimmy Alvcrez scored at
40:58 but the Danes failed to connect
in the finttl four minutes despite

scvcrai close shots in the final
moments.

The total shots on goal for the
game was if) for Union to ii for
Albany. liach goalie had six saves.

In the Saturday game at
Ilrockport. the Danes did play that

“quality soccer" that Schicffclin was
speaking about. “I think we totally
dominated the game." said
'Schicffelin of Saturday's contest.

Albany‘s next two games will both
be at home. On Wednesday the
Danes will take on Plattsburgh at
330 pm. tﬁrd the next Saturday it
will be Potsdam at 2:00 pm. “We are
decisive favorites to win both games.
although anything can happen." said
Schicffclin. I

If the Danes do win both games. It
will guarantee them a place in the
SUNYAC championship game
against the Western division cham-
pion. The Danes have never played
in a championship final before.
despite the fact that they‘ve tied for
the Eastern Division championship
the past three years. In each ofthosc
ycars. Albany lost the Eastern titlc
because of the goal differential
between the lied teams.

The Danes are still hopeful of
making it to the NCAA playoffs.
Schicffel'tn had previously said that
Albany would compete if they had

no more than four losses. According
to Schicffclin. this still holds true. '
“To be certain to get in." said
Schicffclin. “we‘ve got to win our
five remaining games." '
Schieffelin feels that the Danes

still have time to pull together and

make the playoffs. He said that the

October 23rd game on the road

against second-ranked St. Francis

will prove to be a pivotal game. "We

should finish either 7-5-2 or 8-4-2

depending on the St. Francis game."

he said.

Important Wlm
The season so far has been

highlighted by important victories
over Oncontu. Bingliamton. and
llrockport as well as by several over-
ti mt: losses and frustrating near mis-
scs to teams that the Danes probably
could have beaten. Schlcffelin said
that the learn will not dwell on the
past and will concentrate only onthc
task before them. “We can‘t change
what's happened so far.“ Schicl'fclin
said. “no matter how much we‘d like
to."

Munsey’s Strategy Works
As Harriers Edge Colgate

by David Osborn '

Denied the use of two of his top
runners. Albany State varsity cross
country coach Ilob Mttttscy seemed
concerned before Saturday's dual
meet with the Colgate R cd Raiders.
lhc coachcvcn allowed some lamen-
tablc lincs to slip between his
customary barrier upon speaking to
his runners.

In between lhc wit and woe. be
carefully outlined a strategyaimcd at
compensating for the two negated
runners. Each Dane was assigned a
Red Raider to shadow over the 5.05
mile course while paying less atten-
tion to the overall outcome. The
Albany runners took their orders
placidly and sought to prove
Munscy correct.

Less than a half hour later. the
design had held up and was instantly
tabbed in one word - succ sfui.

' ton 6-],7-5. But we came close and

performance."

“The main reason why we lost the.
second doubles match was that we
were tired." said Linett. “We had to
play ﬁve matches the second day. If
we had been fresh. we'd have beaten
thcm. Brit that's not to take away
from Binghamton. They‘re a solid
team and they played well.

"I felt it was a poorly organized
tournament because we played only
one match the ﬁrst day and ich the
second." But looking forward to the
spring season. Linctt said. “I was
really happy at the way we played in
the fall tournaments. ijust trope we
can go undefeated in the spring."
