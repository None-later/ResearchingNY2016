SA President Paul Feldman said
be virtually selects the student of-
ﬁcers and Board of Directors
members of University Auxiliary
Services (UAS) himself. although
UAS bylaws do not give him the
right to do so.

UAS bylaws state that student
Board of Directors members should
be selected by the voting students in
the general membership board.
These student voting members of
UAS are chosen by the SA President
and approved by Central Council.
The bylaws also state that UAS of-
ﬁccrs should be chosen by the Board
of Directors as a whole.

The UAS Board of Directors con-
trols UAS and is responsible for ﬁx-
ing meal plan prices. among other
duties. [1 is composed of ten un-
dergraduate students. one graduate
student. seven faculty members. and
two members of the SUNYA ad-

ministration, which gives students
majority control of the board.

The UAS bylawsare unrealistic
said Feldman. “According to the
bylaws. l'msupposed to select seven-
teen student voting members of
UAS. Then these students, who
often do not yet know each other or
much about UAS. are supposed to
select ten students, from amongst
themselves, to be on the UAS Board
of Directors. There is no way that
these newly appointed students. who
often do not even know each other.
can intelligently pick ten UAS Board
members."

Voting Directive

"On the other hand. I know
something about all the student
members. because they were all in-
tcrviewed before they were selected
as members of UAS. So [tell the stu-
dent board members who they
should elect to the board.“ he said.
"in addition. I also tell the student

SA President Picks UAS Board .

board members who they should
support for UAS ofﬁcers, such as
President, Vice President. Chairper-

_50n. Secretarv. and Treasurer."

No Bylaws Change
However. when asked if he would
attempt to change the bylaws so that
they would no longer conﬂict with
the way board members and officers
of UAS are actually appointed.
Feldman replied. “no. there is just

'too much bureaucratic red tape in-

volved to make it worth ourwhile."

According to Feldman. past SA
presidents have also controlled these
appointments. “but the difference is,
nobody ever admitted it before.”
Last year's SA Vice-President.
Kathy Baron. agrees that it was the
executive branch of SA which decid-
ed who would be on the Board of
Directors and who would be the of-
ficers of the corporation. "We told
the students who were appointed
voting members of UAS who we
were supporting for the Board and
for the various positions. and it Was
pretty rrrucli understood that they'd
probably vote our way."

.ltilllllllllli Hodges. ll member of
last year‘s lloard of Directors, said
“rill voting members ol’ UAS were
told who to vote for." Hodges added.
"t his hits bccri standard practice for
the past three years. Since the bylaws
\vcrc chunng four years ago to give
students majority representation on
the board. we've been able to elect tr
student president of UAS by voting
its rt block."

Directors members, contrary to the bylaws. (Photo: Bob Leonard)

According to Hodges. “the stu-
dent board members were a tightly
knit group last ycitr. In fact. ws
ctrucusscd and discussed the issues
before every board meeting." By
listening to pertinent information
about the issues, said Hodges, “we
found out where everyone stood on
the issues. it worked very well."

l‘cldrrrarr has not yet made his
lirral decisions on the composition of
the student membership of UAS or
ilic student section of the Board of

Directors. However. he will have to

decide within the next few days. The
ﬁrst meeting of the UAS Board of
Directors will occur this afternoon in
Jim Alumni House.

Fcldman. who was President of
UAS last year. said, "I spent the en-
tire summcrtrying to decide who the
next President will be.“ Fcldman,
however. declined to comment on
his choice. “I can't discuss it until

rtttcr llrc meeting." he said.
