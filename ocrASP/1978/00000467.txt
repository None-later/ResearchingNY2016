illiness. You really can‘t deﬁne
it, it‘s just there. And it‘s a lot

of fun. it‘s also the basis forthe
newest school of popular comedy. Andy
Kaufman, who preformed at Page Hall
last Thursday night. is one of its best
students. He follows some of the most
popular current comics of which Steve
Martin is best known. Like Martin,
Kaufman's act is not based upon social or

 

 

political commentary, but rather.
silliness.

Joan Brandejsky

Audience involvement is also an

essential component to Kaufman‘s act. if
the audience doesn't sing along or talk
back and ask “How big was it'?‘ the act
would fall ﬂat.

After a false start, in which Kaufman
failed to appear following several
minutes of house band‘s intro. Kaufman
appeared with a spirited version of

“Oklahoma” with interludes of conga
playing and Kaufman‘s own version of
“Happy Feet". This was followed by a
Iip-synched version of “Little Red
("Here i come to save the day") and a
vcntriliquist‘s version of “Little Red
Riding Hood“, featuring Howdy Doody.
Silly enough you say'IThere was more; A
rousing version of the children‘s song
“The Cow goes Moo" (with audience
supplying the animal sounds), Kaufman‘s
soloing on the Bee Gee‘s “Stayin' Alive,"
accompanying himself on cymbals. and
the Caspin Harvest song, in Caspin.
Probably the best-liked and most well
received portion of the show was
Kaufman‘s impromptu wrestling match
with one Of the female members of the
audience. Seventeen women came on
stage with a lure of a $500 pggﬁ' they
could pin Kaufman to the mat oracount
of ten. An eager woman named Sue. who
admitted to doing it for the money. was
chosen to face off against Kaufman who
was wearing black trunks and white long

johns. Sue. despite a great effort and
massive audience support, was defeated
but receive a consolation prize of350.00.

One of my favorite routines was
Kaufman‘s detailing of a college
assignment on a dramatic reading of the
song lyric “McArthur Park". While allthe
other students want for the level above
memorization technique,“ Kaufman tried
a different approach and did it in his
native Great Neck Jewish. The result
approached what could be considered a
dramatic preview. should Mayor Koch
consider playing Hamlet.

Another favorite was the .imported
entertainer. who has almost as much
trouble with his native language as he
does with English. This character is
Kaufman‘s mainstay on the ABC TV
series "Taxi". His facial expressions.
nervous posturings and overanxious
"Thank You Very Much“all added up to
a perfect character.

Kaufman swung from his foreign

comic into the routine the audience had
been calling for all night: Elvis. Complete
with mirror spangled costume and a
curling lip, Kaufman was the “King” for
some 20 minutes. It wasnot animitation
of Elvis, however, but'ratheracaricature.
The swaggers and swivelswere the same
and the voice was delightfully on target.
For a few minutes youcould getiost inthe
fantasy, but then the impersonation took
a John Belushi-like turn. it was not cruel
or a rip-off. though. ln many ways the
impression was more of a tribute than
most alleged tributes. It was fun, but not
silly, and the audience's shouts and
occassional shreaks of "ELVIS" proved
ll.

Kaufman left his audience literally in
each others arms after an intense version
of yet another children‘s song(l wonder if
Kaufman had a happy childhood)
entitled. “Friendly World”. No one
complained of having to link arms with
the person next to them; they were too
busy having fun.
