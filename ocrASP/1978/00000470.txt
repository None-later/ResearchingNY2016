the final Dane drive failed as a Walsh
pass to Scott Lusher fell incomplete

never got on track and the timing
was never there,“ said Walsh, “There

student from Albany'and had been
cut- from the Daneif here. “He
couldn‘t Wait for us, and hewas their
lbest scout of our team." said
Mirabella.

“We never had a big play to ignite
us." Aufiero said. "We kept waiting
for somethingto. spark us, but it
never happened." "

Buffalo was supposedlya aoftapot
before heading into the brutal sec-
tion of the schedule with Norwich
next week to be followed by Cor-
tland and lthaca at home next
month. "We could have better
prepared mentally," said Mirabella.
That‘s all changed now and even a
five game blitz through the
remainder ofthc schedule mayprove
too little towards the national title.
