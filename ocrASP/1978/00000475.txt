SASU's invitation'to appear at the
next Senate meeting.

“The SASU people should be
better briefed on the individual cam-
puses,“ said< Harding. and he
suggested that a change in SASU
leadership might make the organiza-
tion more acceptable'tohis campus.

SASU Vice President for Campus
Affairs. Larry Mullin.- said that
SASU is currently trying to improve
relations and communication with
the individual campuses.

“Our president. Steve Allinger, is
very interested in Avorking on the
campus level," said Muilin. and he
added that the year‘s ﬁrst issue of the
SASU newsletter Grassroots, has
just been published and will be dis-
tributed to the campuses.

Stony Brook Policy President.
Keith Scarmato, said that he believes
that many of the SASU people are
"dedicated and sincere". citing
Allinger in particular as having
dealt very well with his campus.
Nevertheless. Stony Brook will not
be joining SASU in November. and
it has not been a member since the
campus first split with SASU in
1975.

Scarmuto said that Stony Brook
cut off its relations with' SASU in
[975 when a Third World and a
Women‘s Caucus were admitted to
the Executive Committee ofSASU.

SASU Vice President. Larry Mul-
lin. said that the Third World and
Women‘s Caucuses ensure SUNY
rniriorily and women's groups a total
of 20 votes on the committee. while
there are 60 other delegates from the
'iiiember campuses.

“We‘re not opposed to women's
and minority groups." said Scar-
mrtto. “in fact. Stony Brook has
always worked for issues supporting
these groups. Searmrito said that the
delegates on the Third World and
Women's Caucuses are "hand~
picked" and "strong-armed" by
SASU. He claimed that the caucuses
do not properly represent SUNY's
minority women's groups and that
they are "fronts" for an "undcrhand-
cd political maneuver to assure 2()
extra votes in the Executive ('otn-
rnittee."

Scrirmrito said that the nomina-
tion and balloting procedures have
excluded sortie groups from
representation (in the caucuses. and
have therefore rendered SASU
“undemocratic.”
