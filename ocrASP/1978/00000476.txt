Parents Weekend and University-
Community Day were held on
different weekends this year because
last year's Parents Planning Com-
mittee felt that parents wanted more
attention paid to them. accordingto
Assistant Vice President for Univer-

’ ' sity Affairs. Sorrell Chesin.

Chesin chairs the Parents Pian-
ning Committee which is composed
of interested parents. in addition.
the SA Student Orgainizing Com—
mittee for Parents Weekend con-
tributes to making up the weekend‘s
agenda.

Chesin said that in the l940‘s and
50‘s three major SUNYA events
l’arents' Weekend. Homecoming
and Community Day-were all
separate events. They were com-

CU Day A Success Split
From Parents’ Weekend

bined into one weekend in the early
l970‘s. but the trend is back toward
separation.

“Planning all three events for the
same weekend calls for juggling and
major organization" said Chesin.

One reason for the separation. ac-
cording to member of the Student
Organizing Committee for Parents
Weekend Ken Blaisdell. is that
“parents today are concerned with
more titan how their kids are eating
at school. Most of the students here
are not first generation college
students. therefore the parents
already have an idea ofwhat campus
life is like; now they want to know
the academic details, They‘re asking
pointed questions about S/U
grading. academic advisement,
various degree requirements. etc."

  
 

However. according to Blaisdell.
last year's Parents‘ Weekend had so
many activities that by attending one
event. parcnts' felt they were missing
something else and as a result. most
parents didn't attend the academic
events of the weekend because they
were attracted to unacademie events
like the football game.

in evaluation of the weekend. the
committees involved in the planning
and the parents felt that the separa-
tion experience was an overall
success. . ,

As for next year‘s Parents
Weekend. the Student .Planning
Committee is again in favor of the
separation. Chesin said that the
committees will evaluate. solicit and
receive comments for next year has-
ed on this year's results. Blaisdell
said he suspects the final decision
will be made in late Spring.

Chair of the SUNYA Parents
Grooup Jack Krauss " was not
available for comment.

Crime Prevention
conllrlued from page three
to O'Connor. will be in the area of in-
formal talks with students and
residence directors. SUNYA Police
have a “pretty good idea when and
how a burglary will take place. . .'
is necessary to educate students in
this respect. . . to urge them to keep
their doors locked when unattend-
ed." he said. _

Student apathy and a false sense
of security are two obstacles which
any attempt to educate students
must overcome. “They don‘t realize
until it's too late." O'Connor said, ‘

“and for the most part the stolen
goods are virtually irreplaceable."

Another area to be explored is the
use of patrols in the dorms. such as
those that are used on the downtown
campus. Thby have been “quite
effective in decreasing crime and
promoting greater student-police
communication. and may be tried on
the‘ uptown campus.“ O'Connor
said.

"We‘re also going to set up a
special crime prevention office and
phone number to make ourselves)
more aecessable to students.
