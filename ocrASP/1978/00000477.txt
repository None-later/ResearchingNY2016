Corey Speaks at Conference

continued from page one

student should pay SI7.‘ You can go
out and earn it picking apples if you
can‘t earn it some other way. And I'll
be elected overwhelmingly."

“I don‘t think he comprehended
what was being discussed." said
CUNY Student Senate President
Brian Kunsaki. “You have to look at
things in totality. He had other
things on his mind. Where he was go-
ing after that meeting was to a
meeting of police chiefs in the state
of New York. he was going to give
them It two million dollar contract."

“He definitely could use a course
in manners. how to act like It human
being.“ said Allinger of Carey.
"Most politicians at Icustsmile when
they‘re giving you something. I don't
know if it comes from growing up in
Brooklyn or what.“

 
  

When Carey ﬁnally entertained
the question of a possible merger of
SUNY and CUNY. he adamantly
opposed any move which would in-
fringe upon CUNY’s autonomy.

“The reason that I want CUNY to
remain autonomous is that I want to
deal with the fact that we have trou-
ble.“ said Carey. "Another reason is
that CUNY has supplied more doc-
toral candidates and more doc-
torates than all the Ivy League
colleges combined. lfwe‘re not going
to get those kind ofcnndidates. we‘re
not going to have these [doc-
Ioratcsl.“

“I‘m glad that‘s his stance.“ said
Allingcr. “I think he was sincere. I
believe the governor is one hundred
per cent committed to avoiding the
merger. I can‘t really see the gover-
nor wanting the merger. It‘s not in

 

 

his interests. Some things make
sense and some don‘t. I think [New
York City] Mayor [Edwmd] Koch is

stubborn. but then I think the gover- ‘

nor exhibited a stubborn streak
himself. If the governoris funding 75
per cent of it. I think he‘s made a
good-faith effort to CUNY."

Carey was forced to address the
issue of the condition of the state‘s
community colleges when he was ad-
dressed by a student representative
of the Borough of Manhattan Com-
munity College (BMCC).

“We have six different inadequate
buildings.“ said the representative.
"No gymnasium. no cnfcleriti. inade-
quulc library spttcc. inadequate
lounge space. totally inadequate for
ti college. We are asking you, right
here and now. to commit yourself to
IIpr BMCC get i! completed cam-
pus. We have been evicted from the
buildings . . . "

"You‘re articulate. but. you're

 

Iate.". interrupted Carey. “I‘ve been
ﬁghting to get construction at
Hunter College. at Lehman Collep,
at Hostos College. at York Collep.
The State is ready to go. We're ready
to borrow, we‘re ready todo it, but it
has to get past the Mayor's ofﬁce to
get done. We're ready to go.”
“We are very happy that you are
ready to go.” replied the BMCC
representative. “But the lease is up.
We have received eviction notices.
They have given us one year to ﬁt
out ofthere. By August of next year.
we‘ll be out of there; we‘ll have no
pIIIce to go. We have a campus that is
25 per cent completed."

“I don't think Mayor Koch is be-
ing responsible at till.“ said AIIinger.
“In fact. I think he's part of the trou-
hIL‘. Hejust has no cummitmentat all
to places like Hostos and New York
City Community College.“

According to Kansuki. however.
(‘arcy has absoluter nojustil‘tcation

from Koch. I . .

“The Governor can categorically .'
build . without the Mayor‘s ep- ‘
proval," said Kansaki. "The State
Dormlty Authority is a suite func-
tion. He has absolutely no basis for
playing oll' the Mayor."

Carey also agreed to raise the stan-
dards of SUNY's Equal Opportunity
Program (EOP) to match those of
the Higher Education O'ppt'Iminity
Program (HEOP) currently in use by
the state's private institutions. '

According to Kansaki. the major
problem with the EOP program as it
stands presently is the Division of
the Budget‘s prohibition of the
transfer offunds from one psrtofthe
budget to another.

“There‘s not enough money for
tutoring and counseling in the EOP
program." said Allinger. “You get a
revolving door situation. The E0?
students are frustrated. They want to
succeed. but they can‘t .succced
