FAT’S OKAY

ls fat where it‘s at? William Fabrey
of Westbury, Long lsland.thinks so.
Fabrey founded the “National
Association to. aid Fat Americans“
in I969 and today his group has
chapters in a number of major cities
aroundtthe country. including New
York and San Francisco.

Fabrey believes that fat people
shouldn‘t have to suffer from dis-
criminrition. poor self-images and
demeaning jokes, because. he says,
“fat is beautiful."

l‘abrey's Association provides
over I000 members with a newsletter
and a computer dating service. It
also lobbies on behalf of fat
Americans.

At least one San Francisco physi-
cian agrees Willi l‘abrey. According
to Doctor I‘iiul Scholten. the former
president of the San Francisco
Medical Society. “The time haL
come to stop the waragainst fat. and
admit that people can be fat and
healthy." Scholtcn advises. “Stay fat
and live happy."

THE IDEAL PET
A llritish pet shop Iiiis received
per mission from local authorities to
begin selling cockroaches as pets to
children and old-age pensioners.

one news

l’et shop owner Steve Zlotonitz
says he is already breeding the
roaches that will soon be on the
market. Says Zlotonitz: “They make
ideal pets because they are very easy
to keep, need very little food, and if
you go away on a two-week Vaca-
tion. they can be left ontheirown."

A British professor has protested
the pet roach idea. warning that the
creatures will breed by the millions
and might even overrun London.
However. in granting the go-ahead
to the project. authorities said the
variety of cockroach involved is rat
likely to multiply very fast because it
tends not to breed during c Ild
\vcathei.

WRONG NUMBERS

Millions of Americans are
reportedly being ripped off by Ma
Ilcll on their monthly telephone bills.

Ilrc iiiang/ine US Nun-.v and
World Rt'prirl says that experts who
make their livelihood checking over
business phone bills have discovered
that about nine in every ten monthly
statements contain at least one error;

has caved in to a request from
Chicago Black Leader Jesse Jackson
and has agreed to try to change the

Ertegun says he will risk the Atlan-

so that they don‘t contain lyrics
which Jesse Jacksor‘s group has
found insulting. 'I'he yries in ques-

CONCERT HEARSAY

Concert promoters may soon be
posting warnings similar to the ones
on cigarette packs notifying patrons
that the noise levels at concerts may
be hazardous to their health.

The first such notice was posted
recently at Hollywood's Universal
Amphitheater during shows by
Singer Diana Ross and Comedian
Steve Martin.

Some music industry sources are
predicting that such warnings may
soon be standard at all concert halls
in view of recent studies indicating
that concert goers may suffer perma-
nent hearing impairment from ex-'
posure to high volume music.

POT WITH DRAWAL

Medical researchers at UCLA'
claim to have diagnosed what they
have described as physiological
"milidrnwal symptoms" suffered by

He earned more than $00,000
