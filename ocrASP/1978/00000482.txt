52‘ STREET

illy Joel's last album, “The
Stranger“ was justly one of the
most popular of the year. It

that “52nd Street,“ the quickly released
follow-up, would be just as dynamic but
unfortunately isn't. It lacks the

down on its former. To coin a phrase, it
isn't as commercial

Indeed, lines which we all say at one time
or another. The side ends with
“Zanzibar,” a jazzy show-type tune with
some great orchestration. It‘s the
catchiest song on the side and it contains
some excellent trumpet ﬁlls.

The album‘s second side contains so me
good but offbeat material. "Stiletto" is
interesting but seems like a cheap
imitation of"The Stranger." “Rosalinda‘s
Eyes” is another light easy-listening tune
with a slight Spanish ﬂavor. “Half A Mile
Away” is probably the best cut on the
album being a real upbeat rocker with a
funky-jazzy feel. It‘s probably the only
song on the album which could make itas
a single.

“Until The Night" is an unnecessarily
long lament on a relationship which
succeeds in being a bore. “52nd Street”
finishes out the set; a honkcy-tonk
showtune which is a real throwback to
Joel‘s Cold Spring Harbor Days.

From modest beginnings to a full-
'fledged superstar, Billy Joel has
deﬁnitely come a long way. “52nd Street”
however, seems to be a backtrack from
his recently sucessful stride. The material
is too slow and breezy and there is a

Life," comes off better though; it‘s a light
upbeat number in which Billy Joel
explains:

the players oversteps his or her duty.
“Shoot To Kill" follows, again a good
track with Karen doing a more gutsytupe

“Heleana” finish out the first side; the first
cut beinga lighter rocker which is another
prime album cut. “l-leleana“ doesn‘t
work, even with the help of Aerosmitlt's
Brad eritl'ord because the production
becomes a veritable septic tank and
neitherthe singing or the guitars come out
"alive".

Side two suffers from similar
production tactics although it‘s to alesser‘

stations “mellowing~out“. “Hit The Hard

rambling-gainbling man although one
listen reminds one of “Life In The Fast

"Anastasia". the closing set, is a lament
of (‘/ar Nicholas‘ youngest daughter.
