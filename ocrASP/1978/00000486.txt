team around.

Palmer's favorite receiver is
another one of the Cadets’ man-

Ricker (6‘4". 240) has exceptional

size. His forte. however, is after he
gets his ltands on the football. “He is

well-balanced team. With the two
teams so even. it‘s probablya classic

'matchup —- power vs.- power. It's

The Danes go into battle with a
few key positions still "cloudy." ac-
cording to Ford. Terry Walsh has
played in the last three halfs at
quarterback. with Brad Aldrich sit-
ting down. Against Norwich. the
position is still up for grabs. and
either player could get the starting
nod at gametime. The right halfback
slot is also in question. with Jack
Burger. Fred Brewington. Bruce
Churchwell. and Dave Warhite all
vieing for the job.

the Danes have created more
questions than they have answered.
Beginning their “second season"
against a tough Norwich squad. the
team wants desperately to show that

national championship.

J ayvee Gridders Split Last

by Jim Roth

The Albany State junior varsity
football team faced two tough op-
ponents the last two weeksand came
out with a split. Two weeks ago.
Doug Haines‘ crew took a 22-l9
decision over a tough Cortland team
and last Friday they dropped a hard-
hitting contest to Middlebury. 26-20.
Both games were played at home.

in the first contest. Albany came
out and took a 14-0 lead in the open-
ing half. Freshman halfback Chuck
l’riorc ran in for scores of eight and
il yards.

However, Albany looked listless
in the third quaner. while Cortland
played tough. scoring twice to bring
the score to l4-l3. Albany fullback
Mike DCRUSil then went in fromthe
24-yard line and Bruce Briggs added
llte decisive two-point conversion
for the Danes. After the final Raider
touchdown. Albany ran out the
clock for the win.

Last l‘riduy. on a wet. cold. over-
cast afternoon. the Danes faced a big
Middlehury team. The Panthers
scored first on a two-yard Jim
Loveys to Marc Macomber pass.

Halfback Rick Shutts added the
equalizer later in the opening stanza
on a three-yard sweep for Albany. In
the second quarter. Loveys teamed
up twice with split end Tom 0stler
for scores of 21 and 7t yards.

Down 20-6 at the half. Albany
came out tired up in the third quarter
and scored easily on their first
possession. with Priore going in
from the two.

Macomber capped a 62-yard drive
for the Panthers with a four-yard run
that sealed the lid on the Albany cof-
fin. although it appeared that the
Danes might have one chance
remaining. An Albany drive got un-
der way early in the fourth quarter.
with l’riorc doing the bulk of the
rushing. and scoring on a one-yard
dive.

'fhe Middlebury offense was held
in check. and with three minutes to

play. the Panthers were forced to
punt front their own end zone.
llowever. punter Bob Riltei hit a
monstrous kick that rolled dead at
the Albany iii-yard line.

'l'itue run out with the Danes at
midfield. giving Middlcbury a game

that was characterized by hard-
hittlng. in addition to the game,
Albany lost Shutts for the season
with a broken collarbone.

The jayvee ledger now stands at 2-
3. “with the toughest part ,of the
schedulelcoming up," coach Mike
Walsh ' noted.- He cited the
performances of quarterbacks Mike
Fiorito and Joe Picariella and Priore
who has ten touchdowns on the
season and leads the team in rushing

' with over 400 yards.

The Danes travel to West Point
today for a game with a perennially
tough Army squad. I
