Spikers Win Two Matches

by Maureen George '

The Albany State women a
volleyball squad met with Union and
Utica in a triangular meet Tuesday
night at home. The spikcrs crushed
both their opponents. thus in-
creasing their overall record to a Very
impressive 9-2. _ .

Before the game. Albany captain
Thomasa Dwyer appeared very con-
ﬁdent about the contest and the
season. “We have a very good team.“
said Dwyer. “We are well-rounded.
experienced and have a number of
strong freshmen."

Sure enough. Albany took the

triangular without any difﬁculty.

Both matches were won in just two

games.

In the ﬁrst contest. Albany blitzed
the Utica squad. 15-3, 15-6. Against
Union. it was again Albany who
dominated the entire match and won
two games straight. The scores were
[5-7 and 15-2.

The team's victories mainly rested
on excellent bumping and hitting.
The freshmen added many good hits.

After last night‘s Colgate match.
the women travel to Oneonta on
Wednesday to face the host school
and Russell Sage.

Recruiting wasa big factor. Lewis
still recruits for tennis. but not on the
grandiose scale needed for basket-
ball. llc usually follows up on letters
he receives frotn high school players;
eliminating those painstaking.
laborious trips of the basketball
rccruitcr. in art opportune move. he
engineered the staging of the New
York high school tennis cham-
pionships right here; freshman Lane
Lerner (third singles)arrivcd via that
route.

“It's not good for a former coach
It) so lll on his old team right away.“
Lewis said. with a qualifying
followup. "l wouldn't want to sit on
the bench or anything and make
.lohn aware of me. llut I‘m sure I
won‘t be able to refraintotally. 1'" be

at least two weeks. He could be back
in time for the SUNYAC Cham-
pionship game. Shaw sprained an
ankle during practice and will miss
the St. Francis match.

Schieffclin also withheld
freshman Hector Rouito from the
game in order to rest him for St.
Francis.

Albany's chances for an NCAA
tournament bid are still somewhat
cloudy. Just four teams will be
chosen from what Schieffelin feels
are six legitimate contenders.

Cortland. currently ranked ﬁfth in
the state. along with the llth rated
Danes. Union and three schools
from New Jersey are the prime can-

didates. Union has defeated Albany
earlier, but their schedule gets much
tougher in the next two weeks and
their record ﬁgures to get worse.
Cortland is probably the top
candidate and they were tied early in
the season by the Great Danes.

A win over the tough St. Francis
team. second in the state, 15th in the
nation. on Monday would certainly
bolster Albany's position. The ﬁnal
two contests with Buffalo and RPl
both at home are also “must win"
situations.

“A win against St. Francis should
assure us a bid. A loss makes it more
uncertain. Regardless. we must
defeat RP] and University of Buf-
f alo." said Schieffelin.
