' ‘ 0f Warld Series Contests

BALTIMORE (AP) Mark Stone,
a stockbroker and self-styled psychic
who has appeared on national televi-
sion. apparently predicted correctly
the outcome of each game of the
t978 World Series. including key
plays like Reggie Jackson's full-
count strikeottt and Davey Lopes
two-home run performance.

Stone picked the New York
Yankees winning the series in six
games. saying they would lose the
ﬁrst two games. then take four in a
row. ~

He missed on the scores of three
games -— all by one run. But he made
up for that by uncannily forecasting
key plays and trends for all six games
between the American League
champion Yankees and the National
League champion Los Angele
Dodgers.

“It was quite trying." Stone said
Wednesday night as his predicitions

. were opened by sports broadcaster

Klaus Wagner on WJZ-TV here.
“l'm glad it's over."

Stone wrote his predictions on a
single sheet of paperOct. 8. two days
before the first game in Los Angeles.
The paper was placed in a matchbox
which was bound with a rubber band
and sealed in an envelope.

That. irt turn. Was locked in a
metal box which was wrapped in
brown paper and taped shut. then
given to Wagner on the air. Wagner
held it until Wednesday night when
it was opened during the station‘s
evening newscast.

Stone‘s predictions included:

Game I: The Dodgers “will be up“
for the series opener. and Dave

‘ Lopes will hit two home runs. Lopes
did, and the Dodgers won 11-5.
Stone had the same score.

'Game 2: Reggie Jackson willcome
to bat with two outs in the bottom of
the ninth. the Yankees down by one
run and the potential winning run on
base. “On a full count. Reggie will
take a mighty swing and the ball will
go no where." The Yankees slugger
will then throw his bat in disgust.
The Dodgers win. 4-3. That‘s the
way it happened.

Game 3: Yankees third baseman
Graig Nettles “will save several runs
with an incredible fielding display."
Nettles turned in a performance
reminiscent of Baltimore's Brooks
Robinson in the l970 Series. stifﬁing
Dodgers rallies and helping the
Yanks win 5--l. Stone missed the
score. picking the Yanks 4-l.

Game 4: “A runner will be hit bya
thrown ball and create some con-
troversy.“ Jackson was hit by an in-
field throw at ﬁrst base. the ball
bouncing away. scoring a run and
helping the Yanks win 4-3 in 10 in-
nings. Stone had picked the Yankees
by 4-2.

Game 5: “A Yankees pitcher will
go all the way and the Yanks will hit
as if there‘s no tomorrow." New
York won l2-2, as Stone had
predicted, and right-hander Jim
Beanie went all the way for the
Yankees.

Game 6: One of the Yankees out-
ficlders “will slam into a wall" while
trying to make a spectacular catch.
Right fielder Lou Piniella bounced
off the wall while chasing a fly ball.
He returned to help the Yanks win 7-

2 and wrap up a second consecutive
world title. Stone hadthe score 8-2.
"l couldn‘t believe it. honestly."
said Wagner. “He couldn‘t have
gotten to it beforehand. No way he
could have faked it — no way."

Wagner said Stone had appeared
on several network TV shows. in-
cluding those hosted byJohnny Car-
son and Dick Cavett. as well as
shows at WJZ. Among previous
predictions was picking the NCAA
basketball championship score last
year to the exact points. Wagner
said.

Wagner said he had been reluctant
at first to do the piece with Stone.
"but he came and we talked about it.
and our news director approved it.
so we went with it."

Stone was not paid for his work.
Wagner added. “He just wanted to
do it for the publicity," he said.

Tommy John:
Dodger No More?

[.08 ANGELES (AP) it‘s quite
possible that left-hander Tommy
John has pitched his last game for
the Los Angelcs Dodgers.

John. who won 37 games for the
Dodgers the past two seasons and
would have started the seventh game
of the I97H World Series. has placed
his name on the free agent draft list.
his agent said Wednesday.

“This was the most emotional
season of my career." John said
Wednesday. "I felt like I had two
hammers over my head. I felt like I
had to beat two opponents —- the
other team and my own front ofﬁce.
I‘m hurt. disillusioned and amazed
that they put me through the mental
anguish considering what i have
done for the club."

Hunter, Manson And Lemon
Lead Yankees To Victory

NEW YORK (AP) Fittingly, they
stood there on the Dodger Stadium
mound —— the veteran professional
pitcher. the gruff and ailing
catcher, the unﬁappablc manager.

Catfish Hunter. Thurman Mun-
son. Bob Lemon. and the rest ofthe
New York Yankees were six outs
away from another World Cham-
pionship. ~

Joe Ferguson had just opened the
Los Angeles eighth with a ringing
double and Lemon was summoning
relief ace Rich Gossage to nail down
the title.

“i asked him to letCat pitch a little
longer," said Munson. whose hard-
nosed exterior belies his sensitivity.
“i know what it's like to playhurt."

Lemon said no. and Hunter, who
secmcd deader than the Yankees
back in the early days of summer,
departed to a round of applause
from those who appreciate the work
of a true craftsman. Owner George
Steinbrenner led the cheers for the
player who epitomizes Team Com—
eback.

Placed on the disabled list twice
with early-season shoulder problems
that threatened to end his career. and
loser of his first three decisions.
l-luntcr came back thanks to a uni-
que shoulder manipulation treat—
ment.

He compiled a six-game winning
streak in August and finished with a
l2-6 record. All that after a
humiliatinglate-inningbatteringina
lost cause in Boston four months
ago.
“When they put him in to mop up
on Boston, i said no more of that.”

Do you waste
time between
classes?

A
BIEAKl!

30 min.,

Steinbrenncr disclosed. “I didn‘t
care if he sat on the bench in a tux-
edo. i didn‘t want to see him em-
barrassed like that."

Hunter holds a special place in
Steinbrenner's heart and checkbook.
The veteran right-hander was the
first free agent signed by the Yankees
back in l975.“lt‘s ﬁtting he won the
final game because he gave us the
winning attitude.“ Steinbrenner
said. "He was the foundation. The
reason the Yankees won the World
Championship is because of Catﬁsh
l-luntcr. He was the start of it all.”

Munson. who batted .297 during
the regular season despite an assort-
ment of nagging injuries — knec.
shoulder. ankle. finger— that forced
him to play the outfield for a while.
emerged from his shell of silence
long enough to say thatthis world ti-
tle was swoeter than last year‘s
"because the team was more
together.

Good Player

“lt‘s frustrating when you know
you‘re a good player, and you can't
do it." he added. “The knee was
better the second half of the year. it
really bothered me the ﬁrst half but
the shoulder ~— anytime l moved it
affected me.“

And don't forget Bob Lemon. who
succeeded Billy Martin in late July
and became the first managerto take
over a team in midseason and lead it
to a world title. “i wish someone
would tell me what my contribution
was." said lemon. who didn't swing
a bat or throw a pitch but may have
been the most valuable Yankee of
all.

The Albany State varsity soccer
team scored twice within l:08
seconds in the ﬁrst half and hung on.
despite a sloppy second half perfor-
manoe. to defeat SUNYAC rival
Plattsburgh 2-l on Wednesday after-
noon.

The victory clinched the Eastern
half of the SUNY conference forthe
Danes. They will meet a still un-
decided Western Division Cham-
pion on Nov. 6. Albany sports an im-
pressive 4-0-2 mark in Conference
play. ‘

Thc hooters came out aggressively
in the ﬁrst half, pelting Plattsburgh
goalie Dave Ellman with lb shots.
The Danes played very unselﬁsth at
the outset. as they consistently
played the ball to the open man.

The Plattsburgh defense Was ob-
viously frustrated by the superior
speed and open field skills of tire
(ircttt Dunc attackers. However, for
all the supcrlrrtivcs. Albany held only

“Our forwards and midﬁelders
played very aggressively but their
ﬁnishing shots were just a bit off."
said Danes‘ coach Bill Schieffelin.

Robert Dahab, a sophomore from
New York City. opened the Albany
scoring at l4252 when he took a pass
from Matt Parrella about twelve
yards away. and drilled it past the
sprawling Ellman.

Lightning struck again just 68
seconds later when senior Carlos
Arango. the team‘s leading goal
scorer with eight goals. took a right
wingcruss. warded offtwo defenders
and knocked in what proved to be
the winning goal.

The visitors came out hungry in
the final 45 minutes. They began to
beat Albany to the ball at midﬁeld.
and were anticipating well on
defense. Plattsburgh also forced the
brill well, as evidenced by their eight
shots on Dane keeper Dario Arango.
compared to just three in the first
half.

l’lrrttsburgh's hustle finally paid

. off when striker Dave Armstiong '

sneaked the ball past Arango with
just over 25 minutes remaining.

Albany, clearly lacking the inten~
sity they displayed earlier. were fore-
ed into a defensive style’for the dura-
tion of the match.

Their backline proved equal to the

‘ task. however. as the visitors manag-
ed only a few strong shots which
Arango stopped. '

Schieffelin described his squad's
disappointing play in the second
half: “We played poor. complacent ’
soccer. We adopted their style in the
second half instead of staying with
the teamwork and skilled soccer we
had early in thfgame."

Schieffelin was also pleased with
steady play of junior Kirk Andrews
and senior Pepe Aguilar on defense.

The team was not at full strength
