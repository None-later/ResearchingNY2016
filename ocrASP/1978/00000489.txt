Without Tim Key Starters, Norwich Seeks
Revenge In A Clash 0f NCAA Hopefuls

by Paul Schwartz

Without a doubt, it's put-up-or-'
shut-up time. Half the season is in
the books. and when the Danes meet
a powerful Norwich squad
tomorrow. they will ﬁnd themselves
at a crossroads that will determine if
the national championship is a
realistic goal or just an unattainable
vision.

Last week's devastating l5-8 loss
to Buffalo left the Albany football
team sitting not-so-pretty with a 3-2

“It’s going to

and physically superior personnel.
and they would be more than happy
to avenge last year's 21-7 setback at
University Field. a loss that stifled
the Cadets‘ playoff hopes ofa year
ago.

“There‘s no love lost between our
team and theirs." said Albany coach
Kevin Callahan, who scouted
Norwich last week. “We'll try
everything to stop them and they'll
try to blow us out. They really would
love to get us."

be a battle.”

 

 

record. What it now comes down to
is ﬁve games to be played; a “second
season" in which the Danes must go
undefeated to even be considered for
post-season play.

“The loss to Buffalo probably hurt
our football program more than any
other single loss." said Albany head
coach Bob Ford. "But we ituve to be
realistic about athletics. There‘s
always a chance that you're going to
get beat. and ifyou are destroyed by
a loss, it's not a very successful
program. Hopefully we learned a
lesson from last week's game.“

One think the Danes know for
sure it that a victory in Vermont
tomr :row will not be a simple chore.
Nor t'ich, one of the highly ranked
teat is in the east. boasts a 4-l record

“They've been scouting us every
game." said Dane co-captain Kenny
l’aulo. “l'lntt's how much they want
is.

Unfortunately for Norwich they go
up against Albany with two ol'their
key players watching helplessly from
the sidelines. it was learned late
yesterday afternoon front the
Cadet's Sports Information Director
(icorge 'l'urner that standouts Milt
Williams and Mike Jones will be un-
able to see any action tomorrow due
to injuries.

Williams. a speedyjunior running
back, is the Cadets' "Mr. Outside." A
veur ago, Williams had an outstan-
ding season. averaging 134 yards a
game and scored at a [0-point per
game clip. This past summer. though.

Williams suffered a broken ankle.
and it is this recurring injury that will
shelve him against the Danes.

The defensive star that won't see any
action is safety Mike Jones. He is
coming off a record-breaking
season, placing second in the nation
in total interceptions last year. So far
this campain, Jones had four of his
team's six aerial thefts. A knee
injury. however. will sideline the
Cadets‘ leading defender for the
remainder of the season. and his
absence is sure to weaken the

’Norwich secondary.

l'hc Cadets line up in formations
that are more than vaguely familiar
to the Danes. Norwich utilizes a
wishbone offense and a 4-4 defense,
the same setup that Albany employs.
"It will be like our offense playing
against our defense." said Callahan.

0n offense. the Cadets rely on a
power wishbone rather than the
finesse. triple-option style that the
Danes use. The power is supplied by
a superlative running back that has
his own specialty. Halfback Mike
Crimmcns (5'10".l85) is “Mr. ln-
side.” and he has the ability to gain
large chunks of real estate romping
up the middle. In Norwich's 3l-23
victory over Tufts last week.
Crimmens amassed 94 yards. and is
averaging 6.6 yards a carry so far this
season. With his running mate
Williams out. Crimtnens will havcto
carry an added workload in the
Cadet backfield.

For Coach Lewis, Tennis Is NOW

by David Osborn

When the Albany State jayvee
basketball squad conducted tryouts
earlier this week. he caught a glimpse
of the session from a window perch-
cd atop the court. For ten years they
were his team and even though Bob
Lewis has now foresaken basketball
to concentrate on his position as var-
sity tennis coach. he couldn't resist
the temptation of a quick scan.

"Oh, I definitely think that I‘ll
miss it for a while." Lewis said.

“There's no way you can be con—
ttected with something for that long
and then simply forget it. Butas long
as the school can replace me that's
fine. I'll probably follow the team
this year to some extent."

While John Quattrocclii begins
his initial campaign asjayvee basket-
ball coach. Lewis will watch an oc—
casional game as a common spec-
tator and shift his concentration
away from the hardwood to tennis
full-time. He thus concludes a

decade of success as a Dane basket-
ball coach. and will now focus onthe
tennis team. which has a 73-17
record since he took control eight
years ago.

"I made my decision about two
years ago to concentrate on tennis
more." he explained. “When I was
coaching basketball l didn‘t 'have
any time off the entire year. Between
fall tennis. basketball in the winter
and then spring tennis. l was
coaching all year-round. The
necessity of recruiting in basketball
was also too heavy."

Lewis. who is 45. father of ﬁve and
an area resident. also ‘wanted some
more time to spend with his family.
They will certainly appreciate the
move. but the Danes may miss his
guidance. Exiting with a crash, he
compiled a record-setting lit-2 mark
last year. topping his previous best of
l7-3 in 1973-74.

The tennis team has just com-
pleted their fall schedule and a 4-0
dual mark and coupled with a
remarkable second place showingin
the ECAC‘s. they have earned
esteem in Lewis‘ first venture as a
full-time tennis man. One
disupointment for Lewis was his
squad‘s second-place tally in the
SUNYAC‘s; the championship went
to Binghamton.

“We knew it Would be a battle
heading into the tournament. but I
felt a reasonable showing in the
lower positions. might give us the
edge." Lewis said. "We were strong

“ He pumps the ball up the middle
like there‘s no tomorrow." said
Callahan. “He‘s a real competitor
who fights for every extra yard he
can get."

Much ofthc Cadets‘ success on the
ground is due to a pair of bulking
offensive tackles that. Callahan says.
“come off the ball better titan any
other lineman we've seen this year."
Rigltt tackle Jed Saltzman (6'3".

leaving the Army. but never had the
intention of making the regiona per-

he said. grinning.

tn the midst ofhis stay in Suffolk,
with reasonably good success. the
offer from upstate came. The Milne
School. a junior-senior high
school connected with SUNYA until
its abolishment last year. was in need
of a basketball coach.

"At first i only planned to stay for
the original two-year appointment.
and my original impression of the
school was not that good." Lewis
remembered. “But gradually I grew"
to like the institution very much and

now i look back on it as a very nice
experience. They had no great
athletic accomplishments when I

something very effective. “They
almost come out and tell you “we are

Callahan.

‘ Two Unions Join To Battle Rival

by Steve Outer

Two university professionals‘ un-
ions have formed a coalition to op-
pose a third in an election for the
right to represent the approximately
|6.000 acndemic and professional
SUNY employees at the bargaining
table.

The National Education Associa-
tion (NEA) and the American

Association of University Professors
(AAUP) have afﬁliated in an effort
to unseat the United University
Professions (UUP).

UUP currently represents SUNY
faculty and staff. However. lastJune
the NEA completed a four-month
petition drive that netted enough
signatures to call for a
representation election through the

SUN Y Researches Stocks
OfSouth Africa Afﬁliates

by Jill Haber

SUNY Central Administration
has been told of claims that SUNY
holds stock in corporations which do
business with racially segregated
South Africa and is researchingthe
issue. according to SUNY Vice
Chancellor for Business and Finance
llari'y Spindler.

“We are aware of student interest
on several campuses." said Spindler.
But he said that divestment ad-
vocatcs tnadc no formal contact with
his office.

This issue was brought before the
SU NY Board of Trustees by student
Board member Steve Allingcr, who
is also Student Association of the
State University President (SASU)
said Spindler. The Board asked for
an investigation and Spindler said he
is waiting for information from the
Investors Responsibility Research
Center.

However. Spindlcr would not
comment on when his findings
would be tnade public. saying he is
working under no timetable.

Recently, an Anti-Apartheid
committee was formed at SUNYA
which is urging that SUNY divest its
stocks in corporations which do
business with South Africa.

according to committee Joint
Coordinator Danny Booher.

The SUNYA SA has checked to
make sure its funds are not held in a
bank which makes loans to South
Africa and has issued a resolution
supporting divestiture of cor-
porations with dealings in South
Africa. according to SA Controller
Debbie Ruskin.

The resolution. passed in August
at a Central Council meeting at
Camp Dippikill. also calls for sup-
port of the campaign against banks
which loan money to South Africa.
and support of majority rule in that
country.

According to SA Vice President
Fred Brewington, copies of the SA
resolution were sent to Campus
Center Acting Director Jim
Doellefeld and SUNYA President
Vincent O'Leary among others.

State Public Employees Relation
Board (perb). That election has been
delayed pending a decision on the
status of certain SUNY employees.

AAUP publicly censured SUNY
in June l977, concluding that the
retrenchments of l974-76 were
effected with “disregard for tenure.
due notice. the role of the
faculty...and produced a climate in
which academic freedom is gravely
endangered."

At that time. SUNY spokesperson
Harry Charlton protested that
SUNY was “bound by its contract
with UUP to enact retrenchments in
times of ﬁnancial exigency, and
that its contract protected professors
from capricious actions." .

Both NliA spokesperson Linda
Roscnblatt aml Chair of the SUNY
ASUI’ Representation Committee
liugenc Vasilew. who is a SUNY-
ltinghamton professor, charged that
llUl’ failed to adequately protect its
union members.

“The reason for [AAUP's censure
ol SUNY] is its poor contract with
U U l’." said Vasilew. "U UP has been
giving away too much...essentially
destroying tenure. which means that
a faculty member has to worry about
what he says internally and external-
ly."

According to an NEA news
release ofOct. 23. the AAUP censure
resolution characterized the
retrenchment provision in the UUP
contract as weak and ineffective. as
giving SUNY management
“virtually a free hand in laying off
individuals and eliminating
departments."

However, when the censure report
was made public in August. AAUP
spokesperson Martin Lapidus plac-
ed the blame not on UUP but on
SUNY. “Contractual agreement is
not synonymous with academic
propriety." he said. “SUNY clearly

violated good academic practice.“
Rosenblatt called the affiliation with
AAUP a “perfect blend of the high
AAUP standards...of academic
freedom and tenure...and the cold.
hard skills of NEA."

UUP President Sam Wakshull
assailed the agreement, saying that
“AAUP has grasped for a straw, as
straw which NEA will snatch away
whenever it suits."

“I'm surprised that AAUP would
join hands with an organization that
previously accused them ofseekinga
marriage of convenience," he said.
referring to NEA stabs at AAUP
when the latter union was involved
in coalition talks with UUP.

Binghamton Students Ousted By Dorm Fire

by Aron Smith

A motel. tripled dormitory rooms.
and friend‘s off-campus apartments
are the shelters where nearly l50
SUNY at Binghamton un-
dergraduates are taking refuge after
being burned out of their residence
hall on Friday night.

A fire beginning about 10 .m. in a
first floor corridor lounge in
Lehman Hall of SUNY-B's Hinman
“residential college" (the equivalent
of SUNY‘s uptown quadranglcs)
caused extensive smoke and heat-
related damage to the building's
tln'ce floor, according to SUNY-
B Director of University Relations
Roberta Sheer. No one was hurt.

“The fire completely demolished
the floor lounge on the north side of
the building.“ said Jeff Miller. a stu-
dent eyewitness who photographed
the incident extensively. "It took the
local fire department 15—20 minutes
to get here. The first truck came
about l0:20. and they immediately
saw the ﬂames coming out of the
building. The flames were over 1000
degrees. according to the fire depart-
rriettt reports. Radiators went down,
dust covers on stereos were melted.
“A ceiling came down." he said.
“That just doesn't happen.“

According to Sheer. two students
were trapped on the third floor ofthc
doruntory and had to be rescued by
fire department ladders.

“They attempted to leave the

room by an exit. but they were un-
able to enter the stairway because of
smoke." said Sheer. 'They then
returned to their room to await
rescue as instructed."

According to Miller. however. the
students were stuck on the third
floor because they believed the heat
detector-triggered fire bell to be
another of the dormitory's many
false alarms. "and treated it like a
joke.“

The severest damage ocurred in an
open-doored room within a suite
whose door was open. according to
Resident Assistant Lisa Leﬂtovic.

“All the heat wasjust sucked into

the room." said Lefkovic.
“Everything needs to be cleaned to
get the smell out."
“Those two students' belongings are
practically non-existent." said Pipe
Dream Managing Editor R.E.
(ireenberger. "There was nothing
left."

Since many students had gone
home for the weekend or were out.
only five of the Lil students residing
in the severly affected north wing of
the first floor were present at the
time of the fire.

According to Greenberger. the ﬁre
occurred at the same time that
Charles Manson's prosecuting at—
torney, Vincent Bugliosi. was
delivering a lecture in another
building.

“He was lecturing and someone

jumped on the stage and said thefe's
a ﬁre at Lehman Hall; we need all
Hinman College residents back fora
head count." he said. “About l5 peo-
ple walked out and the rest didn't
know what was going on and got
fidgety. It was pretty much over
then."

Greenbcrger did not know ifthere
was any connection between the ﬁre
and the speaker's appearance on
campus.

Sheer said that the ﬁre has not
been termed "suspicious," pending
investigation by the Vestal Fire
Department.

According to Greenberger,
however. the Lehman Hall ﬁre is be-
ing called suspicious by SUNY-B of-
ficials. as it is only one of ﬁve fires
which broke out within a half an
hour of each other. Small bulletin
boa rd fires. causing limited
damages. were discovered in
academic buildings and in Smith and
Roosevelt Halls. he said.

Residents of a virtually un-
damaged wing on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of
the building were permitted to return
to their rooms Saturday night. Other
students were not so lucky. it will be
at least two weeks before the second
and third ﬂoors are sufﬁciently
renovated to permit the return ofthc
residents. According to Sheer. some
of the residents of the upper floors
have volunteered to be tripled. and
thus remain on campus. The remain-

ing students are being placed in emp-
ty rootns in Hinman Colleges and
elsewhere on campus, or are living
off—campus with friends.

The JI men and women in the
wing sustaining the greatest amount
of damage will not return to their
suites for the remainder of the
semester.said Sheer. At a meeting of
Lehman residents and SUNY-B ad-
ministrators last night. it was decid—
ed that these students will have the
option of receiving alternate place-
ment on campus. moving off cam-
pus, or being placed in rooms at the
Colonial lnn, a motel located across
from the campus.

“Most of them want to stay
together," said Sheer. “if they want
to. that is their choice. if they stay
together. they're going to have to be
tripled at the Colonial."

According to Sheer. students elec-
ting to move off campus rather than
accept alternate placement will
receive pro-rated refunds from
SUNY-B's Housing Ofﬁce for the
entire period that the suite is
vacated. She said that an 9
have been made with Colonial lnn
which will enable displaced students

to live there at the same rate as on-
cumpus housing.
‘Since the ﬁre. campus security has
been beet'ed up at SUNY-B and a
student night patrol force has been
instituted. according to Hinman

The afﬁliation of AAUP and
N EA. according to the NEA release,
“reaffirms the two organizations'
commitment to AAUP positions on
academic freedom, tenure. gover-

nance. and related principles."

“U UP tends to be more interested
in trade-union goals. which are
primarily self-serving." said
Roscnblatt..."We are interested in
adhering to AAUP guidelines of
sound academic practice."

in addition to upholding the
AAUP principles. the parties are
also "committed to the creation ofa
decentralized bargaining and inter-
nal governance model responsive to
the unique needs of SUNY," accor-
ding to a copy of the organizational
agreement.

Decentralized bargaining, accor-
ding to Rosenblatt. provides for the
inclusion of all 64 SUNY campuses
in the negotiation process.

Rosenblatt said that the lack of
decentralized bargaining by the
U Ul’ was the major shortcoming, as
well as a key issue in the election.

UUP spokesperson John Milton
said that UUP already incorporates
decentralized bargaining, describing
provisions in its contract calling for
two members of each campus to at-
tend representation meetings “in
order to formulate the best possible
program."

However, Rosenblatt called one
such UUl’ meeting a farce,claiming
that the union‘s position dominated
the microphones and that dissenting
opinions were “cut of ."

The afﬁliation also calls for ajoint
steering committee comprised ofﬁve
members from each group and an
