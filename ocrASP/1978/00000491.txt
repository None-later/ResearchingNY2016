Approximately SI00.000 is raised
each year from ﬁnes from illegal
parking on campus. according to
Assistant Director of Traffic Lloyd
Hebert.

That ﬁgure amounts to about 60
percent of the total revenue for the
Trafﬁc and Parking Division. accor-
ding to Hebert.

There are approximately 250
tickets involved in trafﬁc violations
given out each day on the SUNYA
campus according to Assistant Un-
iversity Police DirectorJohn

‘ Henighan.

Henighan said that although no
quota is set up for a trafﬁc ofﬁcer on
duty, he says that "lf_a guy who's out
there. whose primary function is
writing out parking tickets and he
only comes in with ten. then he‘s not
doing hisjob. We know what the ex-
tent of the problems are." and he

Anyone who is violating parking
regulations is subject to a ticket. and
these regulations are. according to
Henighan. brought to the attention
of the SUNY community and
speciﬁcally handed out when a car is
registered.

The lack of personell indicates
that the number of violations is
greater than the number of tickets.
Yet the chances of avoiding a ticket
by trying to outguess the ofﬁcer's
whereabouts are minimal since his
area of concentration each day
follows no particular pattern.

At times. said Henighan. there will
be special areas ofconeentration. for

Most of the violations. “are
clear" and a low percentage. he says,
are appealed through the Appeals
Committee which is independent of
Campus Security and was formed in
I968. The board is set up under the
University Parking Subcommittee.
part of the University Council. and
consists of one faculty member. one
staff member. two students and the
Chaiman. Bob Whittam.

Whittam said that in September
there were 3.962 tickets issued, and
there were 256 appeals. of those
appeals. said Whittam. 90 were
granted. 87 denied, and 79 were split.
(The reason for the violation was
accepted. but the situation was cor-
rected. for instance the absence ofa
registration decal).

The problem and seriousness of ii-
legal parking. Whittam said. Was ex-
emplified by a fire in the tower of
State Quad a few years back. when
the ﬁre engines could not get

' through because of illegally parked

cars.

With I0.000 cars on campus.
parking will be a major problem,
said Whittam. "We have enough
parking spaces." Whittam said. "but
not if everyone want to park up
front.“

Hebert said that the parking fine
money provides for almost his entire
budget. with the bulk going towards
the salaries of Hebert, his assistant.
and In other In” time employees.

that the bank is involved in South

“I know our money is not in South

The amount of SA money in the

R’askin. it averages about 5300.000

The SA resolution was based on a

College Resident Wait Rabin. The
student patrol members are paid,
and work in two separate shifts each
night. he said.
AceordingtoUreenbergcr.the ﬁre
and its aftermath have put the cam-
pus on a 24 hour alert. All dor-
mitories are now locked both day
and night. and student vigils have
been initiated within the buildings.
“We have had incidents of this
semester of people hanging around
who don't belong in the dor-
mitories.“ said Rabin. “People are
now apprehensive and very aware of
anyone they‘re not familiar with."
Lately. there have been a lot of
false :IIIIrrIIs," said Miller. “The
previous Saturday night. we had one
at 4:37 in the morning. I know at
least 15 people who didn‘t go out.
and treated it iikeajoke. Now i think
the attitudes on campus have chang-
ed."
