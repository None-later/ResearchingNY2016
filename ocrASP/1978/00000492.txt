MOVIE' MONEY‘ MOVE

If the movies you saw last
Weekend turned out to be a bomb.
why not try asking for a refund from
the box office?

That‘s what TV Consumer Expert
David Horowitz has started. and he

'is adocating that all moviegoers do

the same when a filmjustdoesn‘t live
up to its promises. ‘

ilorowitl, takes the position that
movie studios shouldn't he immune
from truth in advertising re-
quirements. He says he recently
demanded refunds from theaters
showing Annie Hall and The End.
Ihe theater showing Annie Hall. he
claims , pretreated a had print ot'thc
film. and The [5nd, billed as “one of
liurt Reynold's funniest" ,movies.
turned out to be a bore. in
llorowit/‘s opinion.

Iiorowitl, warns that theater
owners aren‘t too happy about gct-

ting refund requests. He says that to
get his Annie Hall refund he had to
write a letter to the theater chain
owner himself.

Horowitz. says he plans to con-
tinue his assault on the box office.
adding its time Hollywood learns
"the public has become tired of buy-
ing promises that don‘t pun out."

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

If you really are what you eat.
most Americans would look like a
three-quarter-ton truck.

l'hat's because. according to the
Highway Users Federation. every
year the average American cats
about 1500 pounds, or three-
quartcrs of a ton. of food.

The Federation says it has also
calculated that the "average
American family" of four consumes
some three tons of food a year. and
that shoppers have about 7000 items
to choose from when they go totheir
local markets. '

How does the Highway Users
Federation get involved in all this?

Well. the Federation is a lobby
group which says it wants to improve
the conditions of America‘s
roadways so that the cost of
transporting all this food by truck
and the cost of food bills can be
lowered. Or. we could all stop eating
so much.

air THE FOOT

There may he more right-footed
people around than left-footed ones.

The Goodyear Company reports
that after "decades of research" at
the company‘s testing plant in Wind-
sor. Vermont. researchers have ﬁnal-
ly come to the conclusion that shoes
on the right feet wear out faster than
those on the left feet.

(ioodycur also reports. in case
you're interested. that when children
ride bikes. they tend to drag their
heels.

COMMERCIAL AGE

Quick. what's the best TV com-
mcrcial you’ve seen this year?

While you're racking your brain.
here‘s what 2500 consumers chase
after being queried by Video
Storyboard Tests. a Madison
Avenue ﬁrm.

According to Storyboard, Pepsi
placed ﬁrst. followed in a hot second
lead by Schlitz. with its “real gusto”
commercials. Coke placed third.
with McDonald‘s. “You! You're the
one." placing fourth. and Doctor
Pepper. “l’m :1 Pepper. you're 3
Pepper. wouldn't you like to be a
f’eppertoott'” ﬁnishing off in ﬁfth
place.

Miller Lite. Meow Mix. Purina
Cat Chow. Anheuser Busch and
Levi's commercials also rounded out
the top ten most popular commer-
cials in that order. according to
Storyboard.

crossings, deer crossings and even an
occasional turtle crossing.

MOONIE MINDS

Researchers from~thrce New York
medical schools have undertaken a
study of 237 American members of
the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church to ﬁnd out what
type of person usually takes up the
Moonics banner.

The study was undertaken with
the agreement of the Church‘s ad-
ministrative leadership._

The researchers report finding
that the average Moonic convert. in
the study‘s words. “was apparently
in emotional distress prior to icin-
ing."

the study also concluded that
lour out of IO converts felt they had
had “serious emotional problems" in
past; 30 percent had sought pro-
fessional help; and six percent
had required hospitalization for
emotional disturbances before join-
ing the church.

The researchers report even
though the Moonics‘ emotional dis-
tress dropped considerably after
conversion. the current emotional
well being of Moonies was lower
than that of another matched group
of volunteers who were not
Moonics.

CANCER WARNING

A New York surgeon is reporting
that persons who drink alcohol
heavily and on a regular basis
signiﬁcantly increase their chances
of contracting cancer.

Doctor A.B. Lowcnfcls of the
Westchestcr County Medical Center
says that alcoholics have a 30 percent
greater chance of developing
cancerous tumors than do non-
alcoholics.

Doctor Lowenfcls says it is not
clear if alcohol itself causes cancer,
or if heavy drinking might trigger
chemical changes in the body, mak-
ing it more susceptible to cancer. He
is calling for more research on thc
subject.
