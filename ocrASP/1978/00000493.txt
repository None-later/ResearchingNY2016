Weekend

ong-time fans and inquisitive

rock‘n' rollers alike packed the

Palace Theatre for a brief, yet

high-spirited performance by

Van Morrison and band
presented by University Concert Board
last Thursday night.

Peter Sgouris

Morrison, who is currently on tour to
promote his new album Wavelengths, has
been a successful singer, instrumentalist
and songwriter for over 10 years. For
those familiar with his music, Morrison’s
style is a personal blend of pop/blues
ﬂavored with rock and jazz. This
combination makes for a distinguishable
sound; he combines driving energy with
sensitive articulation, a careful coupling
of power and self-control.

Morrison began his recording career in
the early sixties as the lead singer of
Them, a British blues-rock group who
had such hits as (the original) "Gloria"
and “Here Comes the Night." When
Them broke up, he went on to pursue a
solo career. Success followed shortly after
with such hits as “Brown Eyed Girl" and
“ Moondance." Morrison now has over a
dozen to his credit, and has recently
appeared in the Band's movie, 77w Last
Waltz.

Thursday night Morrison performed
the previously mentioned hits as well as a

 

 

 

 

  

number of other old favorites, including
“Wild Night” and "Caravan." He also
included several numbers of? his new
album Wavelength, from which the title
track has been released as a single.
Although Morrison appeared somewhat
reserved at ﬁrst, by the end of the second
song he was jumping about, wailing and
clapping his hands. The well-rounded
repertoire combined with this enthusiasm
resulted in a moving performance that
was both lively and entertaining.

The bank was also quite promcient,
particularly the female back-up singer
whom Morrison relied heavily upon to
provide the appropriate background for
his characteristic gutteral moans.

The rhythm section was likewise in
good form. Both the organist and lead
guitarist performed well-developed and
exhilarating solos. particularly during
Morrison's rendition of the Sonny Boy
Williamson classic “Help Me" where Van
joined in on harmonica. This tune came
as an exciting surprise; it being the only
number of the set not written by
Morn'son.

Unfortunately, the bright snappy horn
section in much of his music was absent
that night. What were trumpet and sax
solos on Morrison‘s albums became filler
synthesizer at the concert. Although, as
was mentioned, the keyboard playing was
certainly proficient, at times it tended to

subtract from the freshness and vitality of
the Van Morrison sound.

Another unfortunate circumstance was
the failure of Dave Edmund's Rock Pile
to appear as warm-up band. Instead, the
Allen Harris Band appeared and

audience became so impatient and
inconsiderate that they practically drove
the group off stage. Perhaps this is why so
many concerts have not featured warm-
up bands lately.

But despite these few minor
discouragements. the show was generally
a success. Morrison returned for two
encores, and if someone had left the lights
off he might have been dragged out for a
third, considering the audience's
response. Both fans and the inquisitive
were impressed by the sensitivity of his
voice and the tightness of the band.

Morrison presented himself as an
experienced performer who has stood the
test oftimc. No doubt he will continue to
draw a crowd throughout the remainder
of his career.
