One certainty is that Albany has
clinched its share of the SUNY
soccer race and must await the other
divisional winner to decide their
playoff opponent in a November 7
battle. But the bids are ﬁnalized by
November 5. so the results of that
game will have no béaring on the
tournament hopes.

This Saturday, Albany hosts the
University of Buffalo It l:00, and
Seheft‘elin said he would work his
squad hard all week. The RPI head
coach is on the selection committee,
so when the Engineers come here on
November I. there will be added in-

Fencing Club Tie

The Albany State fencing club
opened their season Saturday after-
noon by entertaininga powerful RP]
squad and earning a satisfying 8—8
tie.

Staging competition in sabre. foil
and cpec classifications. Albany and
R H came out even in total points at
59 for each school in addition to
squaring the bout count. Five points
denoted victory in each category.
and Albany fought offthe triple vic-
tories of Rl’l‘s Tom Anderson and
llarry Williams to earn the tie.

"For us, the tie was more than
gratifying. and it will hopefully pave
the way to a successful season for
us." said Tom Wallace who splittwo
bouts for Albany. “They practice
more than we do and have Williams
and Anderson. two outstanding
lencers. We were absolutely thrilled
to tie them."

 

There are only
