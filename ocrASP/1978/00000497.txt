continued from page twenty-four
back as all good teams do."

Following Palmer's inc'ompletion
to Ricker, Mathis stopped halfback
Mike Crimmins (61 yards on 16
carries) after he gained a couple of
yards. Then. good pressure on
third and eight enabled defensive
end Ed Tranholm to sack Palmer for
a two-yard less, forcing Norwich to
punt. .

As a result of their penetrating.
hard-nosed defense. Albany forced
the Cadets to commit crucial tur-
novers. Palmer fumbled the snap
from center Gary Morton on
the third play of the fourth quarter.
Charging defensive back Don
liowen recovered the ball on the
Cadets‘ 37-yard line.

“We did a lot of blitzing," Paulo
said. “We knew we had to make

something happen. To get our
offense going we needed a spark."

Aldrich then engineered a lO-play
scoring drive. which spanned less
than three minutes. Louis.who hada
spectacular second half with 12
carries for lll yardstl44 total), was
the workhorse. After gaining 30
yards on first down to Norwich's 31-
yard line. he continued his rampage
by gaining l0 more yards.

On a third down and five situation
from the 15. the sophomore
Speedster went 1ch for 12 yards.
Mirabella then barreled in for the
one-yard touchdown two plays later.

Albany‘s offensive line com-
complemented Louis'cfforts with the
presence of huge running room.
“Everybody in the first half was con-
cerned about everyone else‘s job.“
said Dane senior guard Rich

Danes Stage Comeback For 19-14 Win OverNorwich

Aufiero. “In the second half we
decided we were going to go out and
hit people. We moved the ball at
will.“

“Norwich hit hard iand they were
big." said Aldrich.“They tired a little
bit at the end. but they were sticking
the whole game.“

in what could have haunted the
Danes for the rest of the season. a
high snap from center prevented
Berman from getting off the extra
point. The Danes still trailed. 14-I3.

It only seemed natural that Louis
would again be the key performer in
Albany's final and decisive score.
With the defense holding the Cadets
in check. Louis burst outside for40
yards in three carries on Albany's
next possession.

Needing only two yards for a first
down from the five. Louis plowed his

way for the winning touchdown.
Ford elected to try for the two-point
conversion to compensate for the
muffed extra point. But Norwich
finally got wise to the fact that Louis
would be getting the ball.and racked
him out-of—bounds on his attempted
sweep.

Behind 19-14. Palmer ignored his
running game and relied on the pass.
Playing at his finest. the local athlete
from Schenectady connected with
split end Jim Daly for a l7-yard gain
to their 28. Then he hit Ricker on the
other side of the ﬁeld for another
first down. But Palmer threw one
pass too many in Ricker's direction.
as defensive back Rich Heimerle
picked up his second interception
and put an end to their drive.

Continuing their second-half
ability to come up with the big play.
Hyde intercepted Palmer again. This
was after the Cadets recovered a
Dancs' fumble on a center-
quarterbuck snap.

4 Norwich had 'one final chance to

regain the lead when Albany was un-
able to generate any offensive punch.‘
Setting up a dramatic ending was is
debatable pass interference call on
Heimerle.

Ricker ran a straight 25-yard ﬂy
pattern down the “sidelines, and
Heimerle. with a full head of steam.
made contact with the tight end. “I
felt Ricker was out-of-bounds when
Richie hit him and I also felt Richie
was going for the ball. but that was
up for interpretation. though.”
Ford said.

Forty seconds and 35 yards.
That's what Palmer faced in the
game‘s final set of plays. He went to
the air four times. and shot all
blanks. This marked the climax of
a superb defensive effort by Albany.

"Since they got that break
(i ntcrfcrcncc penalty). we felt we had
to go back to our basic defense." said
Albany free safety Cal Flint. “and
then be just a little more aggressive
on the pass. We had to scrap to the
end and win 't."

“Even wittl our two losses. we
never quit.” said Paula. "I think that
helped us."

It can be a glorious feeling. You're
trailing 14-0 at halftime to the home
school. and then you stage a
remarkable comeback that could be
the inspiration for greater things in
the future. Soiwhat does your coach
say as the team leaves the excited
locker room to depart from the
military school?

“i was very proud of them." said
Ford. “1 think this team has great
character. We have a class team."

seemingly stationary defenders.

In it Done backfield that has at
times suffered from inconsistency. it
is Louis that is rapidly becoming the
prominent halfback. "Right now
Levi is very important to our team."
commented Ford. “He‘s a very
consistent brick, does a good job of
blocking. and is having a solid year.
He's our breakaway threat."

Being only a sophomore. Louis
will have many more opportunities
lo dcprcss opposing lcttms and excite
his own with his accelerated play.
Modest and soft spoken. he
admitted in a quiet [one that his
success against Norwich was “the
biggest thrill I've ever had.“

I‘or chi Louis. the thrills have

just begun.

Women Harriers
Short For Meet

by David Osborn

Despite lacking the necessary five
runners to qualify fora team placing.
the Albany State women's cross-
counlry team competed in the 2nd
annual Hartwick invitational Satur-
diiy afternoon and were sparked by
the [21!) place showing of Leslie
I’ricc.

Entering the mere four runners.
Albany was denied a spot in the ﬁnal
rankings. as St. Johns emerged as
the overall victor.

llartwick garnered 103 points.
and based in the fine showing ofthe
Albany barriers present. a
reasonable showing by the ﬁfth
could have secured third for the
Ditties. ,

Captain Debbie Rohrmillcr
finished a notch behind Price in 13th
over the 5.000 meter course (3.1
miles).

“I think it was our best meet ofthie
year and it wasjust too bad that our.
fifth runner wasn‘t there." said
Rohrmillcr. a senior. This Saturday
afternoon, Albany will host their
own invitational with more than ten
schools expected to compete In-
cluding St. Johns.
