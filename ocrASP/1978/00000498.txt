performance by the amazing 30-
year-old Rodgers.

The former schoolteacher from
Melrose, Mass.. won the race for the
third straight year. in 2:12.12 —— the
slowest of his three New York City
victories. but remarkable under the
weather conditions and an arch in-
jury that had hampered Rodgers‘
training the past two weeks.

Nevertheless. Rodgers. who
finished exactly two minutes ahead
of runnerup IanThompson.the 1974
Commonwealth Games marathon
champion from Great Britain. said
he would not have run as fast if Gar-
ry Bjorklund of Minneapolis had not
forced a fast early pace.

After staying at the front of the
pack through the ﬁrst 19 miles ofthe
26-milc. 385-yard grind. Bjorklund
stopped running for a while. then
resumed and finished 77th in
2:29.58. Last year. Bjorkiund stayed
with Rodgers for 19 miles before
dropping brick rind ﬁnishing fifth.

This time. Trevor Wright of Bri-
tain was third in 2: 14.35. followed by
Marco Marchel of Italy in 2:16.54.
Thomas Antezak of Wisocnsin in
2:17.12 and 46-year-old Jack Foster

This past Saturday the Albany
State varsity cross country team
placed a very respectable third at the
sour Conference Championships
at Binghamton. Fredonia won the
meet handily with a score of 37.
followed by Plattsburgh with 69.
Albany with 91 and Binghamton
with 103 to round out the top four of
the 10—team meet.

Strong Effort

Albany's Sean Reilly put out a
very strong effort over the ﬁve mile.
grassy course. He placed sixth out of
87 runners to make the All Con-
ference team. which consisted of the
top seven runners in the meet.

The performance by Reilly was
the best thus far this season by the
sophomore. according to Danes'
head coach Bob Munsey. "He
probably had the best race he has
ever run." Said Munsey.

Reilly has been one of the most
consistent runners this year for the
barriers. Although he was sidelined
against Cortland from illness. he has
been among the top ﬁnishers for
Albany this year. Munsey has come
to expect a good performance from
him and he rarely disappoints his

Netters Compete In Tournament

by Janet E. (‘ernl
As a participant in the New York
State Association Women's Tennis
Tournament. which began on Friday
and ends with the ﬁnals today. the
Albany State women‘s varsity team
will finish their fall season. Thcir
regular season mark stands til 8-].
“If we're not back on Sunday.
which I hope we're not. we're in
Mondays semi-finals,“ sttid an op-
timistic Danes' coach Peggy Miinn
as site departed for the tournament
in Binghrimton on Friday afternoon.
Her predictions are well founded
in examining the team's 15th place
finish with Cortland in the Oct. 6-8
Eastern Conference Tennis Tourna-
ment (which was erroneously detcr- I
mined to be 23rd in the initial tally
and last year‘s eighth-place finish of
37 teams in the State tourney.

competed in the tournament last
year as well. with Maloy playing
through the third round of regular
play and Dcuncmiirk reaching the
second round.

Semiﬁnal Loss

Dcnncmark fell in the semi-ﬁnals
of the consolation round in a gruel-
ing three-hour match. 7-b.o-7. 5-7 to
Jo Anne Lesley. who in her second-
sccd position this year has a strong
chance of squaring off with
Denncmark once again.

Willi her usual foresight. Mann
reserved a 10 pm. practice time slot
on the eve of the competition on the
courts where the tourney Was to have
begun Saturday morning. She ex~
plairied that this was to insure the
women's familiarity with the indoor
surface.

The Great Danes depth this
season extended beyond the playing
abilities of these six women travell-
ing to Dinghiimton. as evidenced by
a commanding 6-1 victory over Ri’l

coach.

Jack Russo also turned in a
tremendous effort. ﬁnishing as
Albany's number two-man and 14th
overall. Mark Lavan was next in
22nd place. followed by Bill Mathis
(23rd) and Ed Von Bevem (26th) to
round out the Great Danes' top ﬁve.

"We didn't run terribly well but we
didn't run terribly bad either,”
evaluated Munsey.

The race had some promising
results for the learn. One of the
bright spots for the harriers was the
moving of Mathis back into the top
runners. Although he still is well off
last year‘s All Conference perfor-
mance. he could be an important fac-
tor in the next few weeks for the
Danes.

Another good sign was the show-
ing of Bruce Shapiro. who is coming
off a leg injury. He didn't ﬁnish
among the scorers. however. it was
encouraging to Munsey that he
finished the race.

The third-place team ﬁnish for
Albany removed them from being
Conference champs. which they
were last year. Their showing also
marked the second worst finish the
team has had in the Conference

'meet‘s eight~year history. no
Albany squad has won it four times
and never ﬁnished further down
than fourth.

This Saturday the barriers are
home at their own Albany In-
vitational. The race is important not
only from a team standpoint. but
also from the individual runner‘s
view. It is after this race that Munsey
must pick his top seven runners for
the important New York State
Championships the foilowingweek.

Fair Way

Munsey decided to keep the team
at home, passing up the ICAAAA
Championships. He felt it would be
the fairest way to pick his top seven
at a race ran on their own familiar
course. ‘

He is also looking for a better per-
f ormanoe from his team in the com-
ing week. “now that everybody‘s com-
ing back." he said. “I think we're go-
ing to get better.“

The Albany Invitational begins
with a women's three-mile race star-
ting at 11 am. The varsity and JV
meets begin at 12 noon and 12:40.
respectively. The race is the last for
the junior varsity team on the

. season.

Volleyball Squad Loses To
Home Colgate Red Raiders

by David Osborn

“We should have stayed in bed."
said Albany State women's
volleyball coach Susan
Harrington after her squad
staggered brick from Colgate under
the weight of a 1 1-15. 9-15. 15-7. 10-
15 loss to the Red Raiders Thu»
rsday afternoon.

The setback dropped Albany's
mark back to 9-3 after a double vic-
tory last week over Uticn arid Union.
They continue their chase towards
the divisional championship
tomorrow with a triangular at
Unconta with Russell Sage.

"We played our worst mutclt till
your and the errors just continued
throughout the entire match." said
Harrington. Albany constantly fell
behind in eiiclt game itnd were forced
to play cateltup. But the quick.
though short. squad fell fictima to a
barrage of misfortune on each

attempt to close the gap.

Albany was quickly trailing 6-0 in
the opening game and could never
get back into it thereafter. In the
third game. Colgate jumped out to a
5-0 advantage before the Danes
shifted into overdrive and tem-
porarily rallied. closing the margin
to 2—1 in games. They same no closer.
however. as the Red Raiders nearly
squandered a 5-0 lead in the fourth
game but held on.
