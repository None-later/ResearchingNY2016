Turnaround In Vermont: Danes Stun Norwich
Aldrich, LouisAndDefensive EffortKey 19-14 Comeback Victory

by Rich Sellpon

(NORTHFIELD. Vt.) It can be a
discouraging feeling. You're trailing
I4-0 at halftime to the home school.
which happens to have several thou-
sand military Cadets cheering their
idols on as the half ends. Adding to
your frustration is an inconsistent
offense, and a defense that generous-
ly gives away a second touchdown

(NORTHFIELD. VT.) It starts with a quick break through the
crowded middle of the line. Then a subtle. but explosive cut to the
outside to free him of any pursuers. Finally. a sudden burst of speed
that sends him untouched up the field for still more yardage

Yes. it‘s another long gain for Dane running back Levi Louis.

“I wasn‘t really looking for the holes.“ said Louis.“but iftheyshow-
ed up I was going to run through them. and that‘sjust what happened."

Actually. what happened was that Louis provided the spark that
Albany needed in their l9-l4 come-from—behind victory over Norwich
on Saturday. When the speedster ﬁnally cooled his heels. he had
shttked. rattled and rolled for acareer high I44 yards. with agaudy I I l

despite his undersized physique.
Measuring only 5‘7“ and a tidy 160

a big man's game. On the Danes go-

and bulled his way in for paydirt.

“chi's a tough. hard-nosed running back." coach Bob Ford said.
“He‘s not very big. but boy he's tough.”

His strength is really an added plus. because Louis‘ calling card is
simply his raw speed. Using an innate ability to know when to cut out-
side. and his “instinctasa runner." Louis hops.skips andjumps around

with no one near IO yards of the
triumphant receiver.

Then top that off with a prospec-
tive third loss and a .500 record that

Not professing to be a Knute
Rockne. head coach Bob Ford felt
the motivating “chit-chat" among
the players at halftime was not too
sincere. “it sounded like we were in
bad shape." Ford said. “We men-
tioned to them that Norwich bad a
goal (NCAA playoffs).and they'd be
ready to play. We had to take the
figltt to them or we'd get whipped
badly.“

Defensive Whipping

For the most part. it was Norwich
who was doing the whipping in the
first httlf. especially defensively. Led
by lineman Mark O‘Brien and tackle
Bo Powell. the Cadets halted
Albany's offensive maneuvers.

The two Dane offensive plays that
broke for long gainers in the first half
were a game-opening 40-yard half-
back option pass from Jack Burger
to split end Bill Zieman. and Terry
Walsh‘s brilliant second quarter 50-
yard keeper. However neither play.
led to a sustained scoring drive.
Freshman place kicker Gary Berman
missed a 30-yard field goal for the
Danes‘ closest chance at scoring.

The defense set the tone at the out-
set of the second half by stopping
Norwich‘s wishbone attack cold on
their initial two drives. Led by defen-
sive tackle Dave Mathis and
linebackers John Veruto and Don
Hyde. the Danes slowed down a

Cadets' rushing game which com-
piled 97 yards in the first half. They
only managed a skimpy I6 yards in
the last two quarters.

Catching the spirited determina-
tion of the defense. Albany's offense
begart to roll up yardage with greater
case than earlier in the contest. Brad
Aldrich effectively piloted his team‘s
potent running attack. something
that starter Walsh Was unable
to do. “It‘s not that Terry was play-
ing bad. but we just weren't putting
the ball inthe end zone." said Ford.

“Brad has the cool. analytical
ability to see what the defense is do-
ing. That‘salways been his strength."
Ford added. “He did a superlative
job.“ ‘

After a short Norwich punt.
Albany had possession on the
Cadets‘ 47-yard line midway in the
third quarter. Typical of their best
movement. Louis‘ quick opener
began the Danes‘ shredding of their
opponent‘s 4-4 defense. His l5-yard
scamper. followed by tight end Ed
Sellers‘s 20-yard reception of an
Aldrich aerial. gave the Danes a first
down on the II.

Loss Yesterday Dims Booter Playoff Hopes

by David Osborn

A trek down to New York City
yesterday certainly hurt the Albany
State soccer team in their quest for
a berth in the NCAA Division III
playoffs. but the decision still awaits
a telephone call in two weeks.

Phil Klah showed utter disdain for
the Dane title hopes when he
rocketed a low drive past Albany
goalie. Dario Arango at the 9:55 of
the first half and lifted St. Francis to
a l-O victory. The loss put the Danes
seasonal mark at 6-4-2. which is very
precarious for the NCAA bid.

Heading into the contest. Albany

boasted an llth place ranking
among the stale soccer schools; St.
Francis stood at number two. Any
chance for thettournament shot must
be preceded by Dane triumphs irt
their ﬁnal two games this year and a
complicated unfolding among their
major rivals.

Albany had defeated the number-
one ranked state team.0neonta. last
month so they were not awed by the
tag of their foes. They played a tight.
unwavering game and even outshot
St. Francis l4-I3. Arango made l0
saves in the Dane cage. and the lone
score struck the crossbar before
bounding in.

“We had some really good oppor-
tunities. and if we had converted one
of them anything could have
happened." said Albany coach Bill
Schicffelitt. “It‘s just a tough. tough
way to lose. They converted on the
one chance. and we failed a few times
on ours."

The best Albany opportunity
came in the opening half. Jimmy
Alverez had taken a crossﬁeld pass
from Carlos Arango and crept within
the goalmoutlt and handsltaking dis-
tance of St. Francis keeper Dignan
Radovich. Unfortunately. 'the

 

greeting never took form and
Alvarez sidestepped the gathering
and saw ttothirtg but net.

Here the chance went astray.
Alvcrcz attempted to raise the ball
over the befallen Rndovich‘s head
and overcompensatcd. His shot
sailed inches above the crossbar and
grazed the netting atop. The Danes
never came that close again on a hot
sunny afternoon with temperatures
in the low 80's.

Radovich is a returning two-time
All-American goalie. and he stiﬂed
the. Albany attack while leading his
mates into a I0-2 position which may
enhance their Division I tournament
possibilities. Since St. Francis lacks
a soccer field on their Brooklyn cam-
pus. the game raged on a vacant lot
at Columbia University.

Miro Urlik slithered the ball
through a wave of Albany defenders
to set up the Klah score from his

 asseumcmwawn... » r

midﬁeld position. “He had us a little
confused in the early going." said
Scltieffclirt of Urlik. “After the goal
we adjusted to him. and he didn't
lturt us anymore. but be was very in-
strurttental irt controlling their at~
tack.“

Pepe Aguilar. at center fullbttck.
or superback as the Danes refer to
him. played well as did Jorge Aguilar
and Alverez. who also had the other
Dane chnrtcc. He received a boun-
ding pass from Pepe and dribbled
past two St. Francis defenders to set
him up irt Rndovieh‘s zone. but his
rolling kick to the left was
smothered.

“it seemed like our offense con—
trolled the game. ttnd the ball was
down in their end most ofthe time,"
said Arango. who leads the team
with nine goals. and was one of the
several Danes playing in their native

“We were running Well outside
trttd things scented to pick up in the
other places.“ said offensive assis-
tttnt Mike Welclt. wlto coaches the
runrting backs. "Everyone blocked
and did their job. We honestly feel
we cart run against any defense as
long as we eliminate our mistakes."
I That was evident as the Dane
ruslters combined for 3l0 yards on
66 carries. Albany's runners are now
combining for an average of 268
'yards per game.

One play after Sellers‘ catch. a re-
juvenutcd Aldrich rolled left and
found a clear path to his liking for a
si x-yard score. Herman's extra point
cut the Cadets‘ lead in half. l4-7.

For Aldrich, returning as the
Danes‘ starter was something that lte
had been looking forward to since he
was replaced by Walsh two weeks
ago against 'I‘owson. Did a shoulder
separation that lie suffered two years
ago against Norwich provide him
with extra incentive? “It probably
did a little bit. but not as much as get-
ting my starting job back."

Norwich had an excellent oppor-
tunity to match Aldrich‘s
touchdown two minutes later. in
what was a crucittl series for the
Albany defense. Cadet Tony Maz-
zonntt recovered a Mike Mirabella
fumble on the Danes‘ 36-yard line.
and quarterback Mike Paltner
proceeded to test the air waves in a
hurry. He overthrew his favorite and
dangerous tight end Paul Ricker,
primarily because Albany‘s secon-
dary was guarding the 6‘3". 230
pound Ricker like they had stock in
hint.

“We had our passing defense
revolve around Ricker.“ said Paulo.
“Brit mainly we had to play a solid
defense — just do our assignments
nrtd believe in each other."

Late in the first balf(2:39 left). the
Danes‘ coverage against Ricker fold-
ed and he was wide open in the end-
to rte for Norwich's second
touchdown.

“Wejust played for the run and lie
broke containment." said Danes‘
cornerback Joe Racjzak “He lofted
the ball over our heads. it was iust a

Drop Policy Compliance Doubted

by Jessica Sllles

Although students and faculty
agree that it was the spirit ofthe new
drop policy to have graded work to
students before today. the last day to
drop a course. it seems that some
professors have not complied.

Vice President for Academic!
Affairs David Martin sent an
explanation of the new policy on
Aug. 26 to all faculty members. and

then sent a reminder Oct. 3
requesting that a grade be obtained
by the final drop date. according to
Dean for Undergraduate Studies
and Assistant Vice President for
Undergraduate Academic Affairs
Helen Defosses.

However. according to SUNYA
President Vincent O'Leary. there is
no regulation demanding that a
grade he obtained by that time. nor is

Faculty Group Meets to
Abolish AAUP Censure

by M..l. Mentmott

Ways to remove the censure of
SUNY by the American Association
of University Professors (AAUP)
were discussed by the SUNYA
llnrrtanities Council at its meeting
Wednesday.

Members of the cottncil have
cltargcd that the censure. a public
reprimand for alleged employment
impropricties. has lturt the recruit-
ment of new faculty at SUNYA.

“A university urtder censure like
this does ttot get applicants forjobs.
cspccitrlly from those considered im-
portant in their field.“ said French
professor Jack Richtman. a council
member. “I suggested to the council
that getting the censure removed is
very important to SUNYA.“ The
council is composed of represen-
tative fttctrlty from ertclt of the
Ilurnartitics disciplines.

The SUNY system was censured
by the AAUP irt .Iurtc. following a
unanimous vote of its members. In
August I977. the AAUP concluded
irt a report that retrenchments con-
ducted witltirt the SUNY system
front l974-l976 were effected with
"disregard for tenure. forduc notice.
for the role ttf tltc faculty . . . and
ltavc prodttccd tt climate irt which
academic freedom is gravely en-
tlangercd."

The AAUP does rtot at this time
represent the SUNY facttlty. wltoare
members of the United University
Professions (UUP) union.

The censure ofSU NY is not a legal
action. but rather. according to
AAUP spokesman Martin Lapidus
in a recent interview. “a moral one
whose consequences would be felt
within the academic community.“

United University Proioulona

One possible remedy. according to
Riclttntan. would be to reitire the
terttrred faculty who were rctrcnclted
at SUNYA. 'l'hirty-two such faculty
lost their positions durittg the
rctrertcltmcnts. the most itt tltc
SUNY system on one campus.

“In the Humanities College. four
tenured faculty were rctrcnched. and
caclt one of them could be reltired
tomorrow. because we've got the
[faculty] litres for them." Richtman
said.

SUNYA Vice President for
Academic Affairs David Martin dis—
agrees with Richtman that the cen-
sure ltus really hurt recruitment of
new faculty at SUNYA.

“We sure had no problem
recruiting people this fall.“ Martin
said. “Their concern may be based
on other issues.“ he added. Martin
would not clttboratc on what those
issues might be. but added that many
new faculty ltnvc already been hired
for as far ahead as next fall. in-
eluding sottte in the Humanities.

Another member of the council.

there any way to enforce such a
ruling.

The new policy states that
students may drop a course without
receiving a "W" until Oct. 27th —-—
one week after mid-semester — but
cannot drop after that date. unless
the case is appealed for health
reasons to the Senate Academic
Affairs Committee.

The former policy permitted a
student to drop a course until the last
week of classes but receive a grade of
"W" on his/her transcript.

According to C'rair of the SA
Academic Affairs Committee Mike
Levy. "the number offaculty having
trouble getting grades is arguing
with the students for a later drop
date."

lltc SA committee is currently
polling students at the Registrar‘s
()fficc on whether or not they have
received a grttde irt the courses they
are dropping.

Levy said that in the first titrec
days of the polling. a list of 25
professors who haven't given a grade
was compiled.

“We‘ve had people pollittg at least
half of the time the office has been
open." said Levy. "So lrtr. we‘ve
polled over 400 students dropping
cotrrses."

Anotltcr question being asked of
students is whether they would have
dropped the course if it had been
S/U graded. Levy said that the
findings might precipitate tt proposal
that the amount it! time at the
beginning of the semester students
cart opt for SW grading be
extended.

The findings of the poll should be
ta'bulatcd by the weekend. said Levy.

Psychology Department Chair
Gordon Gallup said that by now his

students “should have a clue as to

tcoursework based on the texts. labs
and questions. I have rto objection to
the policy bttt it is inappropriate for
my coursework to give an exam at

Professor Robert Wesser of the
history department said he gave an
essay test to his introductory class on

“I cart ich with it. I ltavc no strong
opinion one way or another."

Professor Bernard Johnpoll ofthe
Political Science department said he
hasn‘t given an exam because
“teachers didn't know about the new
policy until about two weeks ago.
and by that point it was too late. . .
There ttrc so many policies in the air
lterc that unless we‘re given very
definite regulations we don‘t follow
them."

Johnpoll believes the policy is a
mistake; that students should be
allowed to drop at any time. In his
opinion. “this school worries too
trtuclt about formality and too little
about education." He added. “I
don‘t know why the decision wasn‘t
open to all faculty for discussion."

Professional Union Elections Postponed Again

An election to choose between two

ty Professions (UUP) in a four hour
long effort to expedite election
plans. The ltearirtg. mediated by
representatives of the state Public
Employees Relations Board
(PliRli). was snagged on the ques-
tiort of when ballots should be
mailed out.

NEA ended a four month petition
drive last June which garnered
cttouglt signatures to force a
clcctiort through
ERI). Since then. the NEA has
tllied itself with the American
Association! of University Professors
(AAU P) itt its efforts to unseat U UP.

NEA Spokesperson Linda

Meanwhile. UUP President Sum

.Tltc controversy centers around
he failure to designate an election
date. llotlt parties have accused each
other of purposely attempting to
delay tltc vote.

NliA wants a December fourth
clectiott date because. according to
ltosenbltttt. some 2.300 new SUNY
faculty and staff ltave rtot been udd-
ed to an employee “list,” and conse-
qucntly would not receive ballots if
the mailing were to be held prior to
that dttte.

“We-feel that these people would
be disenfranchised ifthe ballots were
to be mailed out earlier." she said.

  
 

“That‘s nonsense,“ claimed UUP
Director livelyn Hartman. “lt'sjust
a PR lirte. These people are
guaranteed ballots. They are in-
telligent people artd will evaluate the
issues. 'l'hcy‘rc [N EA] just not
prepared yet. They have no
organization. no constitution. no by-
laws . . . artd no negotiating com-
rnittee."

U UP staffmcmber John Converse
said that NEA first vetoed a UUP
and PERI! supported Nov. 2i date,
calling ittstcad fora December mail-
ing. Then. according to Converse.
NliA similarly refused to accept a
Nov. 27 compromise.

Hartman called the NEA
December date untenable. explain-
ittg that. since the Christmas rush

would slow the mail, the ballots_

would be delayed so as to push the
return date irtto intersession.

"NEA is just stalling for time."
said Converse. "They wattt the
chance to proslytisc [the new SUNY
errtployees]. Whatever the problem

with the new employees. no party .

would be lturt morethanthe other."

Rosenblatt called the UUP
charges “ridiculous. It‘s rather shod-
dy oftltemtosaytltttt. . .lt‘sjust not
true. . .'l'ltcy'rcjust ttot interested itt

The main problem. according to
Rosenblntt. is UUP‘s refusttl to
accept an agreement with the Com—
mittee of Interns and Residents
(CIR). anotlter union which has
blocked the election. claiming to

have the right to represent some 600
SUNY health-related employees at

Currently all SUNY employees
are represented as a single unit.
However. the CIR petitioned PERB
to ltave tltese health-related

claiming that they have specific

needs which warrant specific
representation. ’\
According to Rosenblatt. a

proposal was introduced at yester-
day‘s meeting calling for a CIR

victorious. If both unions signed the
