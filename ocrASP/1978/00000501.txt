Student Association of the State
University (SASU) Women's
Caucus and SUNYA Feminist
Alliance members led a weather-
shortcncd rally for Medicaid fun-
ding of abortion between the Capitol
and the Smith building on Wednes-
day.

Rally Curtalled

Originally planned to last four
hours. the rally was curtailed
"basically because of high winds.
and equipment that wasn't work-
ing." according to SASU Women's
Caucus intcrn Janie Stienman.
Sticnman termed the rally “a begin-
ning. the ﬁrst time so many groups
had met."

The rally. co-sponsorcd by
Albany urca National Organization
for Women (NOW). Friends of

Family Planning. NARA.
Washington DC. and SUNYA
Y0ung Socialist Alliance (YSA),
drcw 30 participants and featured six
speakers and music supplied by stu-
dent guitarists.

Fllht Anticipated

SASU Women's Caucus Delegate
Sharon Ward anticipates a "light in
the legislature this year to cut
Medicaid funding for abortions.
We‘re sure people in the Capitol
heard us,“ said Ward.

Ward. who acted as closing
speaker. said it was a good sign that
all six groups got together for the ral-
ly. “l'm encouraged to see people
working together." said Ward.
Citing women‘s gains in the past
seven years in areas such as ERA.

Ward added. “We must be united r

again." r

Sticnman said the rally was
successful in "showing other
channels in which issues may be
perceived. I spoke to a man who con-'
sidered abortion to be murder before
he heard us," said Sticnman. “After
the rally. he told me that he saw the
whole pro—choice theme has nothing
to do with the moral issue." Pro-
choicc merely gives all women the
option of abortion. according to
Stienman.

According to Ward. the timing of
the rally was intended to “take ad-
vantage of the Weather while it was
still decent.“ SASU Women's
Caucus intern. and Feminist
Alliance member Carol Kalson said.
"Considering the weather. we did the
best we could. I think a lot ofcncrgy
was generated that will be put forth
to good uses."

“I was somewhat pleased," said
Sticnman. "People who walked by
heard what we were saying . . . we
reached a lot of people."

Ward said it hick of publicity may
also have contributed to thr: small
number oi active participants in the
rally. “l ptrt up a lot of posters. but
that same night they were ripped
down." According to Ward. oihcr
organi/crs cxpcricnccd the same
rchult when they put up postcrs.
