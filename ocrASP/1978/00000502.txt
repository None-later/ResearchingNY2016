 "(rehearse

Although an official vote was
never conducted. Central Council is
going to stick by SA President Paul
Feldman's decision to give SASU
the backing of SUNYA. according
to Central Council member Lisa
Newmark.

At an informal summer meetingat
Dippikill. Feldman. speaking for

_ SA. gave SASU the support of
SUNYA. According to Newmark.
“Everyone was consulted. itjust was
not official."

A constitutional question was
raised by Central Council Chairman
of Internal Affairs Scott Lonsberry.
"The question should have been
debated openly. even though it
would have been approved. There
are people on council who. for one

    

reason or another. were not com-
pletely happy with the SASU deci-
sion." he said.

Members of Central Council were
offended and upset with Lonsberry
for discussing the SASU issue
publicly. according to Lonsberry.
Lonsberry said he felt the students
have a right to know what is going
on. “By challenging the precedent. I
was challenging the president." he
said. He claims the issue involves a
‘personal disagreement with how
the decision was made."

Although earlier in the week he
said he would bring up the SASU
issue at Wednesday night's meeting.
Lonsherry decided to “permit things
to settle down" and said that “The
problem deals too much with per-
sonality conflicts and it would have

been detremental to light about it."

Although he still disagrees with
what oecured he is taking a “let
bygone: be bygones attitude" and is
ready to “deal with the problem [of
the question of presidential power]
so it will not occur again.“

An emergency meeting of the In-

ternal Affairs Committee was held
prior to Wednesday night's Central
Council meeting Where it was decid~
ed not to raisethe question of the SA
president‘s authority in this type of
summer. emergency situation.

In the Constitution there are no
speciﬁc powers delegated to the
president for the summer. according
to Newmark. Just what the president
can and can not do is a very am-
bigious question. she said.

 

 

Because of these ambiguities and
unclear guidelines. that the Internal
Affairs Committee of Central Coun-
cil will draw up a bill to lay down
guidelines for just such a summer
situation like the SASU question,
said Lonsberry. The committee will
be defining the president‘s power at
times when the Central Council is
not in session. and "the bill will in-
clude many checks and safeguards.”
he said.

Faculty Group Meets to Abolish AAUP Censure

Philosophy Professor Kenneth
Stern agreed with Richtman on the
issue. however. “It‘s a terrible thing
that we‘re under cisnsure. and it will
only get worse. Good faculty will not
come here and those already here
will try to leave.“ Stern said.
According to Martin. he knows of

The purpose of the council's dis-
cussion of censure. according to
both Richtmanand Stern. was to
begin an effort to bring abOut
changes both at SUNYA and in the
SUNY system that will lead to the
AAUl"s lifting of the action.

Discussion of the censure and
possible remedies for it will continue
into next Wednesday's council
meeting and perhaps even into the
following week. according to the

Armand Baker.

that we‘ll be able to make a moreex-
pert proposal. which could include a
request to rehire the retrenched
faculty. Any proposal must be voted
on by the council. ofcourse, before it
can be reported."

According to Richtman. any
future report or resolution drafted
by the council on the subject of
SUNY’s censure. would probably be
sent to SUNYA President Vincent
O‘Leary. other SUNYA councils.‘
and the other SUNY campuses.

Associate Vice President for
Academic Affairs Robert Shirley
called the censure of SUNY “a
philosophical difference betweenthe
system [SUNY] and the AAUP."

'I‘he AAUI’ has recently formed a
coalition with the National Educa-
tion Association (NEA) in an effort
to unseat the UUI‘ as the represen-
tative union of the SUNY faculty
and staff. Martin feels that there is
“nowuy"thatSUNYA orSUNY can
deal with the AAUI’ on the question
of retrenchment guidelines. because
of the existing contract with the
UUl’.

“’l'he entering oi' the AAUP into
the race for representation changes
things even more." Martin said. “If
we dealt with them now we'd be
charged with unfair labor practices
for sure."
