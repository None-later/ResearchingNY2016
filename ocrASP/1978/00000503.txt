issues such as improved child care
and no restrictions on abortions.

A surprise note to the already sur-
prising report of St. James' can-
didacy is the fact that the former
prostitute has changed her party
denomination and will campaign on
the Republican ticket.

St. James. who‘will reportedly an-
nounce her candidacy at the famous
annual San Francisco “hooker‘s
ball“ on October 20th, says that to
prove her seriousness about her cam-
paign. she will enter the ball riding

MORE CANCER NEWS

A team of scientists has come up
with a surprising discovery that
could throw a monkey wrench into
many ofthe recent studies on cancer-
causing agents.

The researchers at the Thermo
Electron Corporation report they
have discovered the presence of
cancer-causing substances in the
special animal feed that is fed to
laboratory mice and rats.

The particular feed in question is
recommended by the National ln-
stitutes of Health. it is composed of
l3 major ingredients plus vitamins
and minerals, and was specially for-
mulated to be free of disease-
produeing chemicals. particularly

GREATFUL PYRAMID

Rock promoter Bill Graham says
that the concerts given by the
Grateful Dead at the foot of the
Great Pyramid in Egypt during a
lunar eclipse were someof his most
memorable expei'ienees. ever.

Graham told Rolling Stone: “l've
never danced in public before . . .
but dancin' to Sugar Magnolia in
front of the Sphinx and the Great
Pyramid  in my old age. if i
remember major events in my life.
this will be one of them."

JIMI AND JANIS

Apparently. nostalgia for the
l960's has fallen on hard times. at
least in some parts of the nation.

A recent attempt at recreating the
lives of Jimi Hendrix and Janis
Joplin in musical stage productions
has been shut down after just two
performances.

Initially. the two promoters
behind the production planned a 60-
day tour and possibly a broadway
opening for their show called “Jimi
ind Janis together again."

However, the show closed after a

omewltat less-than-enthusiastic
'eception on opening night.
