fter all the imitations. the

second generation and even

the third generation punks. the

Ramones remain in a class by

themselves. As they
convincingly demonstrated . last
Wednesday night at the Hullabaloo, the
Ramones are one of the few bands that
personify the essence of rock and. roll: raw
energy, protest. simplicity and indignity
towards everybody, anybody and
anything. Despite being away from their
home turf (New York City), the Ramones
marched into Rensselaer undaunted and
performed an overwhelmineg powerful
and enjoyable concert.

Gary Douglas

It is easy to criticize the Ramones for
their simple-minded three chord rock and
banal lyrics. but to do so is to take them
seriously. And one should deﬁnitely not
take the Ramones seriously lestthey miss
the humor and sarcasm which is their
essence. The Ramones are a caricature.
They are an exaggeration ofwhat stands as
the most fundamental foundation of rock
and roll: defiancy. rebellion and a “just
because" attitude. The Ramones stand
against the pseudo-progressive rock of
the seventies and drive home the point by
creating outrageously deﬁant. simple-
mindcd songs and lyrics. Their songs
contain lyrics two sentences long with an
array of unit-social messages: I don’t
wanna walk around Willi you. I don’t
wanna walk around with you. So whyyou
wanna walk around with me? Simple and
straight forward. they make no claims of
sophistication. The Ramones are
dccandence par—excellence.

The Ramones serve to remind us that
rock is rebellion ~~— an outlet for teenage
frustrations and rejections with love and
society at large. Rock is notan exercise in
sophisticated notions of melody.
harmony and rhythm. It is a social
rm vcment. lts artistic value lies in its
genuine sincerity and straight forward
character.

The essence of this message was
brought home during one of the most
exciting moments of Wednesday‘s
concert: Joey Ramone prancing around

the stage holding high a picket sign that

read “Gabba Gabba Hey“. It doesn't
matter what'the sign says — you ﬁll in the
meaning —— the important thing is that
they, seem to be suggesting that we get off
our collective asses and protestthe recent
progressive. pretentious trend in rock and
roll. Without a doubt the Ramones
provide a sarcastic, humorous social
commentary and. in this vein. are
thoroughly enjoyable.

From the opening song, “Blitzkrcig
Bop." a cut from their ﬁrst album. their
steady superfast rock beat drives on
unrelentlessly. As the sweat poured down
the group‘s faces by the gallons one
wondered where they got their energy,
N 0. on second thought. no one wondcrctl

it just was and everyone just kept
shaking some part oftheir body or all ot it
to the beat.

And the beat went on w and on and on

. The foursome. all of whom hau-
assumed thc last name Ramone (.lt)L‘)'.
.Iohnny. Dee Dee and a new member
Marky). played most of their ﬁrst album
and a great deal ofcuts from their other
three albums including “Don't Come
Close.“ another straight forward anti-
social song from their new album “Road
to Ruin."

The non-stop steady beat and the
simple songs are too obvious an
exaggeration of what rock and roll has
been throughout the years to be taken
seriously at face value. There is a message
in the form ofa reminder and protest: no
more love songs. no more progressive
music. in fact the Ramones writc unti-
lovc songs. The innocent deﬁancy of the
fifties and sixties love songs has
evaporated. It has become
(unfortunately) associated with the social
complacency of the pseudo-progressive
seventies music. So the Ramones have
become anti-love in order to remain non-
complacent.

It is difﬁcult to appraise the Ramones
for the simple fact that they aren‘t trying
to break new boundries. or reach
sophisticated aesthetic meaning. This is
pure social commentary. sarcastic and
funny, and done with comic strip
simplicity. Laugh with the Ramones. but
first stand and shout 7- shout anything
but shout!

Gab/m Gab/m Hey!

eet me at the Last Chance for
lesson number one."
The Last Chance

Saloon. no less. down Central

Avenue. heading toward Lark
Street. Past l’auli's Hotel. Mickey's Bar,
The Colonial Inn. The Boulevard. each
one looking less and less the kind of place
I'd want to drink in. Down past the
sporting goods shops. the jewelry stores
and food stores. the clothes shops and
cheap boutiques. Splashing through
puddles and tripping over cracks in the
sidewalk. the rain is soaking through the
hood and shoulders of my sweatshirt, and
it‘s getting colder and windier and more
desolate the further downtown I go.

J.M. Reilly

Central Avenue is ugly enough in
daylight. but at l em. on a rainy. mid—
October Friday. it's absolutely obscene.
Garbage and dogshit. muddy puddles in
the pitted sidewalk, and the few people on
the street are all stumbling along. either
drunk or cracked, shaking and muttering
to themselves as they teeter by.

The ﬂat wood sign above the door says
this is the place. and l peer through the
rain-streaked window. past the gaudy old
Adam‘s Family type organ propped up on
the windowsill. into the dim smoky
interior of the joint.

The Last Chance Saloon . . . It looks
like something out of the Klondike ofthc
l840's. a rickety collection of boards and
tarpaper thrown up on the edge of
civilization as a place for the lucky and
unlucky Gold Fever victims and local
lumber camp rowdics to spill their money
and blow off steam.

Except this one has pinball machines
and shuffle bowling instead of dollar-a-
dancc girls, and cable football over the
bar. And it's in the middle of Albany,
though Central Avenue may very well
seem like the edge of civilization at this

 

 

Cueing Up ﬁt
The Last Chance

time of night.

It's pretty dark inside. the yellow
imitation street lamps up front and plastic
tiffany ones stuck in the ceiling further
back don't throw much light. and the
walls and ceiling are painted dark. not
brightened at all by the posters of old

. Sears catalog ads tacked on them.

The back bar looks like a trio of old
barbershop cabinets with a board thrown
across the top and stacked with bottles.
The front bar itself is scuffed and gougcd.
the plastic covers on the stools are stained
and tom. the heavy old floorboards are
warped and splintered in places, dusty
and worn. the whole floor heaved up and
swayed like an old barn floor.

The place looks abused. The chairs all
wobble. there's busted glass all over the
floor. and cigarette burns on everything.
the bar. the tables. the pool table.

The pool table. Attention focuses here
automatically. The only bright light in the
bar hangs low over the table. making the
green felt seem particularly vivid against
the drab. dim backgroundjust beyond the
tight circle of light.

C.Q. is there. bending low over the
table. his blond hair and red chamois shirt
set off by the field ofgreen. Stretched to
gain the proper angle, poised on toes and
fingertips. his cue stick slides slowly back
and forth a few times. then darts out
across his thumb like a lizard‘s tongue,
cracking the cue ball into the three which
plops into the corner pocket. leaving the
cue ball motionless on the rim.

“Nice shot." muttcrs C.Q.‘s opponent.
leaning back in the shadows pulling on a
cigarette.

C.Q. nods and gives me a wave, crushes
out his cigarette and sinks the ﬁve and the
two balls straight. and puts the eight ball
into the side off the far cushion.

“Nice gamc." C.Q. says.

The loser hands C.Q. the beer he's had
waiting and just grunts, putting up
another quarter as heads for the men's

wlth. among other thlngs, an Adam's

room in the back.

“Making friends again. huh C.Q.?"

“Yup. Didn't think you were coming.
Ready for your lesson?"

"Uh huh. Teach me."

“Not that easy; it‘ll take a while. Lotsa
practice. And concentration. But for
now. a lot of watching. You watch."

While he was talking. C.Q. moved
around the table. racking balls, flicking
things off the felt. chalking his cue stick,
lining up the cue ball across from the
tightly packed triangle of balls at the far
end of the table.

“First you break. clean and hard; but
not too hard. Stay in control."

Crack! The triangle exploded.
scattering balls all over the table. two
rolling into opposite corner pockets.
There were a few appreciative grunts
from the dozen or so people leaning
against the wall or standing around the
table watching the game.

“Why do you come to this place. C.Q.?
it can‘t he the location. or the
atmosphere."

“It's alright. I feel comfortable here.
Not too much bullshit, you know? I come
in to relax. have a few beers, and shoot
pool. We made a few friends here who do
the same. That's it."

C.Q. stroked the cuc ball soft. so you
couldn‘t hear the stick make contact with
the ball. and nudged the IZball intotiside
pocket.

“Always think about where the cue ball
will be after a shot before you take it; go
for good position."

He dropped the nine ball into acorncr
pocket.

As my eyes got used to the dim lights
and smoke. I could make out more of my
surroundings. There was something
hanging from the ceiling just over my
head. it Wits a skin of some sort, furry,
with a tail. A fox muybe'.’ Either that or a
dog. A shape high on a wall in the corner
hanging over the plastic-covered benches
along the wall caught my eye. A decr‘s
head. Right. The place looks tnore like
some ramshackle hunting lodge in the
backwoods of Northern Maine than a bar
on an urban drug.

The bar was crowded. but not full;
most of the people seem to congregate
from the pool table forward. staying away

from the large open area toward the back
of the bar. A dozen tables line the walls on
either side. with us many chairs. and

along the walls are the plastic-covered table.

benches. Lost in the shadows at the back
of the place is a raised platform covered
with old stools. boxes. and dust. One of
the adjoining walls is half covered with
.egg cartons. many of which lie scattered
amid the dirt and rubble on the platform.

Obviously, that stage hasn't seen a band

in quite a while. ‘

Most of the people in the bar 'Iare
young. probably IE to 25. with afew older
regulars sitting at the bar. But they're ‘not
the same group of people I‘m used to
seeing in W.T.s or O‘Heaney’s, not your
middle and upper middle class student
types. Something about the way they
dress. the things they talk about. and the
way they talk about them tells me these
people are working class people, and
most of them are or will be earning their
living very soon, probably at a blue collar
job.

The work clothes, the heavy shoes. the
laborer‘s arms. the talk about the
“Goddamn State,“ that “crummy truck.”
and the “creep foreman.“ tips. furniture.
and kids gives it away. There‘s no talk of
tests or cums or law school here, and less
of the idealistic starry—eyed future gazing
innocence of the typical 20 year-old
college undergrad. for whom “making a
living.“ and living a living. are still safely
in the future.

These people are doing it now, not
“when I get my degree."

Because of that. there is a certain
toughness. almost a harshness, about
them. that students just can‘t have; not.
until they have had a dose of day-to-day
making a living. and really tested all those
ideas. values, and words against the often
banal. sometimes oppressive, and always
inescapable actuality of “making a
living."

“1 come in here to get away from
school. from all the thinking, all the
talking. I like to leave all that for a while.
and just do something. Playing pool is
what I like to just do." C.Q. said.

Then I understood why C.Q. always

local student httngouts. where. as furus he
was concerned. there was nothing to do:
there were only things to be said.

C.Q. struck the cue ball sharp. just a
hair off-center. putting just enough
English on it to spin it away from the
corner pocket he plopped the eight ball
into. took it swallow from a fresh beer,

and dropped the next quarter into the
