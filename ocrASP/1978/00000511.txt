“For me. it was a very enjoyable
season and everybody seemed to get
along which eliminated any bicker~

Clabeaux. “i don't mind the com-

Rich Woods (a junior) we will
hopefully have a very ﬁne staff.“

The Flynn twins. Wayne and
Willie from Niagara Falls. gave
Albany good speed aside from an
identity dilemma. Wayne played
centcrﬁeld after Plantier switched
over to left. and had a healthy .368

He reached base 25 times and stole
lo bases, giving him a ﬁne shot at
i’lantier’s school mark of 24 in the
spring.

Willie Flynn played third mostly
and was used sparingly asa utility in-
ﬁelder, but still garnered 9 stolen
bases. Holding down the third base

the fiesty ﬁrst baseman from
Bayside, six-foot Dave Peck. Alter-
nating as the designated hitter on oc-

ofﬁcial trips. His on-basepercentage
was an astounding .588 and he
recorded many key hits in late in-
nings for Dane victories.

"The frequency of the pattern was
frightening." That formula left the
Danes with a poor 3-7 SUNY record
to carry over into the spring in yeai-
long race for post-season play.

Clabeaux reversed the trend when he

“We peaked for Siena.“ said
Chusid. “They‘re a Division 1
baseball team. the normal rivals for
Albany, and coach Burlingame said
they'd been beating us pretty badly
for the past five years and enjoyed
doing so."

“Timely hitting was maybe the one
thing we lacked most,” said
Clabeaux. “if that can come around
in the spring. we could have a win-
ning season."
