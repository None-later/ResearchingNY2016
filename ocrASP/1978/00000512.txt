hopes of heating ()neonta and

match in two straight games I0-15. 4-.

Hit: defeats marked the second
[one that Albany lost to RussellSage
and ()nconta.

Two Matches

“Our blocking and our spiking
were not up to par; consequently. we
were not able to generate an
aggressive nor effective offense."
said Albany coach Sue Harrington.
“As It result ourdefcnse was weaken-
ed by our sub-par blocking."

Jill Menoff showed a great in-
dividual effort in the second match.
according to Harrington. "I feel Jill
did a super job in the last game
against Russell Sage." said

i Harrington. "She came offthe bench

in a tight situation and performed
almost flawlessly."

“l‘m very pleased and happy. but
we still have 'thirdsetitis'. “laid
Mann of her squad's 8-3 record.

“You feel empty with all the free
time at the end of the season, but you
know all the long hours were worth
it." said Denenmark. “We all had a

special camaraderie this year; we were
able to laugh to and from matches,
and we were less competitive. We
took things much lighter than last
year.

“I'd also like to thank Mrs. Mann
for this season. She-is surpassed by
no other coach. She has a genuine

.concern for us —— she doesn't just
view this as a job. She's very
enthusiastic and interested in us as
people."
