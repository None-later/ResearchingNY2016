‘Moody’ Red Dragons Host
Anxious Danes Tomorrow

by Paul Schwartz

What can you say about a team
that comes within two touchdowns
ofthe number-one Division III team
in the state. and then the very next
week is down 64.0 before the first
half ends‘.’

'I'ry inconsistent.

The team responsible for this see-
saw‘ play is SUNY rival Cortland.
aitd wltcrt the Danes go up against
the host Red Dragons tomorrow. it
will be this split-personality perfor-
mance tltat will play the key role.

"They‘ve got potential." said Tom
Meyer. the Albtiny coach who
scouted Cortland last week. “Being a
iltysicttl education school. their
\liolc tcttrtt is tnadc up of good
athletes. Ilowever. they seem to lack
enthusiasm at times. I guess i

. depertds on what mood they're in on
Saturday,"

The Red Dragons were no doubt
iii a bad mood in their fourth game
of the season against East
Stroudsburg. Cortland was down
JI—O before Stroudsburg even got a
firstdown. That translates into an
incredible amount of big. one-shot
scoring plays against Cortland in
rapid succession. After a 644) Itali-
time margin. the game settled down
in the second half. The Dragons
barely narrowed the gap and ul-
timatrty lost 64-7.

Met a 48-I4 trouncing by Alfred
last week. Cortland returns for their
homecoming with a record of 3-4.
Equipped with a defense that is
allowing over 30 points a game. the
Dragons appear to be the squad on
which the Danes can unleash their
still-stabililing wishbone ttttack and
come away with a big victory.

However. a number of painful irr-
juries may sideline some of the
Danes key starting personnel. As of
late Wednesday. the team‘s medical

report had cornerback Joe Rajczak
on top of the list; a "very doubtful"
sittrter out with a swollen knee. If
Rajezack does not suit up. it will be
sophomore Dan Adams that will see
his lirstfront-line action for Albany.

Also hampered ()n the defense is
etid Jim Dignan. who was knocked
otit of the Norwich contest due to a
tltiglt injury. Digitan is probable for
('ortland. but will be backed tip by
Art O‘Connor. who saw a healthy
amount of playing time first week
and did a credible job.

Defensive halfback Daryl Haynor
is also probable. nursinga sore back.
Offensive lineman Rich Auficro and
John D‘Anna round out the doctor's
report. botlt coining dowrt sick aitd
are uncertain against the Red
Dragons.

The one change in the Danes‘
starting lineup will be the return of
quarterback Iirad Aldrich to the
number-one slot, After ttit extremely
impressive showing iii the second
ltalf last week against Norwiclt.
Aldrich will replace sophomore

Ierry Walsh as signal cttller.

For the Danes. this gttrtte is a
stopover that cart make next week's
Ithaca matchup either a crucittl.
season-making game or simply
artothcr Saturday afternoon outing.
Sitting with it 4-2 record. the Danes
cannot lose again to ltavea shot at an
NCAA playoff bid.

Not unlike the fluffan squad that
shocked Albany two weeks ago.
Cortland also relies on a surprise~a-
minute offense. 'I’hc Duties will be
coitlrotttcd with a multiple offense
that will sltow an l-lorntation. a
split-back formation. or a passing
setup. “You never know what you're
gonna see from tltcir offense," said
Meyer.

“Atty team that rises a multiple
offense causes confusion for the

defense." added Danes‘ head cottclt
llob I‘ord. "But it also gives that
offense less of tin ability to execute
properly. because ofall the switching
around. We must be able to move
into the right defense fttrcaclt situa-
tion."

It is the Red Dragon's effective
passing attttek that the Albany
defenders will have to gear their
attention to. Quarterback John
Siittek (5'1 I". 180) has completed 50
percent of his tosses so far this cam-
paign. attd has a pair of lightening
last receivers to aim for.

I’Itiy-alikcs l-rank (iorolcski ttnd
(ieitc (ileeson are both six foot. I75
pounds. botlt have tremendous
speed and are threats to break a pass
play into a long gain. In addition to
the two specdstcrs. Cortland
possesses a qttality tigltt cttd in .lack
(Earrin (6'3". I90). “lltcy like to
throw to liint across the middle."
cotttrtteitted Meyer.

"We must be able to stop their
passing.“ said Ford. “Af'ter'l‘owson.
they probably lutvc the second best
passing attack we‘ve seen this year."

When tlte Red Dragons go to their
ground game. they will primarily
give the hall to running backs John
Dcvciitlorf (5'7". Illtl) or .ltide Fran—
cois ((i'l)“. I95). Neither is an out—
standing back. but both are capable
of coming through with a bigday. As
an added plus. Devendorf is also a
dangerous kick return man.

“'I'he key to stopping Cortland is
to contain their wide receivers and
control the rttnning game." said
Meyer. “Their offensive line is really
not that strong.“

()u defense. Cortland lines up in a
5-2 with a monster back. plttycd
strongly by Dart Reynolds (5'll".
NO). the other solid position on the
defense is lirtebacker Jim Fruscellu.

the Red Dragons thus far have
been rttorc titan charitable to their
opponents. allowing successive
scores of 27. ()4. 39. I5. and 48 (the
urtsportittg l5 was given up against a
weak llrockport team). Accordingto
Meyer. the Danes should sftttre the
success of their predecessors. “I
don't think they cart stop us." he
said.

Despite the obvious incentive of
the NCAA playoffs that the players
arid coaches ltave going into the Cor-
tlaitd contest. tltcrc is a more subtle
one that will also be a factor.

"Seven coacltcs on our staff are
from Cortland.“ said Mcycr. a Cor-
tlatid grad himself. "So quite a few of
its would really like to win
tomorrow."

'l'hus inspired. the Danes would be
deligltted to rittg up an impressive
win in Cortlrtttd to catch the eye of
the NCAA ranking committee. And
the Danes can‘t help but pecrarottnd
the cortter to see the ttiigltty Bombers
from ltltaca. who are ranked tltird in
the ttatioii. lootnirtg iii tltcir path.
lint first. they must play against art
inconsistent. unpredictable team
that might be sky ltiglt for their
hoittccomittg. arid who gave ltltacu
one of their toughest games all year.
a 27-13 Cortland defeat.

It‘s simple. A loss itt Cortland. and
it's better luck next year. A win. and
the Danes cart finally stop glancing
around the corner: Ithaca will be
right iit front of tltcrtt.

the anti-grouping regulation which
states that four or more unrelated

Corning also said he would give
priority to the correction ol all

treat them separately from the anti-
grouping violations. according to
Cronin.

atraid to report code violations
because of it possible anti-grouping
violation.

Secondly. there is "selective
enforcement" of the ordinance. in
that it may be enforced on some
groups and not others. said
b‘cldman.

Ihirdly. Feldman said that
“many students cannot afford a
four bedroom apartment for three
people.“ He said he told the mayor
that it was good economically for
the city of Albany to repeal the
ordinance because many students
were moving to areas outside of the
city for housing.

Ircldtnan said that Corning was
“fairly vague" on his responses ttnd
claitncd to have “no power" in
repealing the ordinance.

Corning was unavailable for
comment.

Iltc subject of the anti-grouping
ordinance was also brought to light
recently iii the case of SUNYA
student Ilrian l-‘crris. who was
served an eviction notice from his
apartment due to this violation.

Lester said that the presentjob is to
get a possible change in the zoning
variance. Such a change could
allow the students to remain in
their apartment for the remainder
of the year despite the violation.

It was actually chance that put
Brian Iferris in.thc center of the
controversy. according to Ferris‘
apartmentmate Bob Kaplan. u’l'he
landlady had to evict one of us and
Brian just happened to be the one."
said Kaplan. Kaplan added that if
Brian is evicted. the other three in
the apartment would move also.

Altltougb landlady Angela
Multarc served Ferris with the
eviction notice. she is actually
against the anti-grouping law. " l'he
Itiw is ridiculous and unfair to
students." said Multarc. She is
willing to light the ease in court
arid could face a still line in the end
for violating tltc anti-grouping lttw.

I-erris. ItoWever. is more
itttercsted in staying iii his
apartment than the actual outcome
of the case. He said "If we get a
stay in eviction. it will be at least a
year before the case comes up. and
by that time we'll be out of the
picture.“

Senate Tables Withdrawal Bill

by Pat Frrtneomano

After almost ltulf an hour of
debate on the floor. the University
Senate tabled a resolution ttssailing
the cttrrcnt drop policy fit a special
meeting lteld yesterday.

llte resolution. introduced on
the floor by David (lross.
contended that “many students
were forced to make a decision
whether or not to drop a course
without the bettelit of sortie type of
evaluation to guide their choice."
arid “Whereas lht: current situation
is uttlatr to students. be it lttrtltcr
resolved that the Seitate requests
the President of the University to
investigate and execute a procedure
of proper recourse for those
students described above.
preferably by art extension of the
drop dcadlrrtc for those students."

the resolution. writtett by Senate
member Mark florkowski. was a

joint effort by BorkOWs'ki and Mike
Levy. according to Borkowski.
Horkowski said that Hugh Hill
advised him that a revised edition
of the resolution would pass after
Ilorkowski presented the original
one.

However. a conflict arose in
llorkowski‘s schedule and he was
urtablc to introduce the resolution.
Instead. (iross brought the motion
to tltc floor. leaving his supporters
to the dark as to where to proceed.

Many objections were voiced
concerning the wording and intent
ol the resolution. Two such
objections came from cit-Senate
Chair Donald Bishko. liishko said
that lie did not believe that it was
the intetttion of the Senate to
provrde for the evaluation

Itc proposed the policy last year.

Bishko continued by
emphasizing the fact that the drop
"is not there to escape bad marks.
it's tltcre to drop a course that you
don‘t like."

A student Senate member replied
that “while it might be the
philosoplty ot the faculty to drop a
course you don‘t like. for many
students the drop is being
considered so they don't ruin their
cumulative average and chances of
graduate school."

Senator Hugh Hill stated that “I
sat in on score of the C.A.S.
meetings that were involved in the
decision find it was my
understanding that it was in fact
part of the plan for a student to
receive an evaluation from his
instructor before the drop deadline.
We understand that this policy was
implemented quickly: We
understand that many of the
professors who did not evaluate did
so out of ignorance."

the senate voted to table the bill
as its last action of the day before
adjournment. Commenting on
future strategy. Borkowski said
that the senate Would wait until the
December meeting to introduce a
more mild version of the resolution
with the emphasis being put on the
importance of evaluation.
