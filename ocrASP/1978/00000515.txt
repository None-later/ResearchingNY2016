Carey and his Republican
challenger, Perry Duryea. have
spent much of their race for the
governship arguing over the state it
past history, rather than outlining
their programs for the future.

Still. the campaign has produced
some proposals lor llrc luture. with
Duryea. as belils the role at a
challenger to an incumbent.

- oll'ering more specilic new
proposals. while Carey touts this
record in ollicc.

Here is a review ol the major
issues at the campaign. with some
ol the proposals and charges til
each candidate. and some attempt
to put them in perspective:

Carey claims Jobs "declined by
600,000“ under the Republicans.
Actually. the number of private-
scctorjobs in the state increased by
a net total 558.000 in the It)
Rocketeller years. But Carey is
using statistics going back only to
the state's all-time bigli Jobs ltgurc.
in June I909. and they show that lit
the last iour years ol the
Republican reginre the state lost
627.900 Jobs.

New York state equalled or
exceeded tltc economic growth ol
the rest ol the country. iliit it began
to run into trouble in the early
l9till's. llie state‘s rate ol growth iii
private-sector Jobs- over the It-
Republican years was lt).(i percent.
compared to 29.3 percent lor the
nation as it whole. even while the
portion ol the state's economy
taken by state and local taxes was
doubling. in the last Republican
gubernatorial term. Jobs in New
York actually declined. by 2.7
perciiit. while the nation gained My

Education

lhe courts are expected to rule
during the next gubernatorial term
that the state must drasticrtily revise
its scltool-linrincing lorrntila to
redUee the huge inequalities in
spending between rich and poor
districts.

In other states such rulings have
lorccd state tax increases and
caused political turtitoil. liut
rieillier Carey nor l)ur'yeti has given
any liittt ol how he would deal with
such a mandate. .

Izticli man has promised.
however. that regardless til the
outcome ol the court ctise he would

fact. but such an increase would
cost at least $800 million in the $12
billion state budget.
’ Welfare

Neither man .proposes any
increase in welfare benefits, which
have"not been raised since I974
despite an increase of more than 34
percent in the cost of living. They
argue over cutting costs. Carey
cites statistics showing that
Medicaid spending is down. the
number ol Well'rire recipients is
down rind the ol'llicial statistic
which is supposed to measure
wellarc lraud is down. too. Duryeri
says "there is still a billion dollars"
ol waste in welfare. But his
research stall ctles no detailed basis
