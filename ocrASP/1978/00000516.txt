CHAMP GUIIE

The next time you happen to
have a muscle cramp. don’t lose
heart; that excruciating pain
may be able to be relieved by a
short pinch ofyour fingers.

Sports Medicine magazine
reports that in most cases of
muscle cramping, a firm pinch
of the upper lip between the
thumb and index finger will
relieve all signs of discomfort.
Researchers reporting in the
medical publication advise pin-
ching the lip for 20 to 30 secon-
ds, or for as long as it takes for
the cramps to disappear.

According to the magazine,
cVen doctors can't figure out
just why this rather bizarre anti-
cramping remedy works.

DREAM ON
The Better Sleep Council
reports that in this era of
liberation, the dreams of
American women have also
become more “liberated.”
The Council says that until

ZQIAB

recently, women commonly
reported they were often the vic-
tims of another person's
aggression in their dreams. In
addition. conversation and
emotional feelings usually
took precedence over overt
physical action in most female
dreams.

The Council says. however,
that studies at the University of
Virginia's Sleep and Dream
Laboratory show that the

' themes and images of women‘s
dreams are becoming more
“liberated” for all women,
regardless of whether or not
they have been associated with
the Women’s Movement.

The Virginia study found that
women now identify people by
occupation in their dreams, just
as men do. The female dreamer
and other women are reportedly

to hugs and kisses, are now said

If you like a beer or two,
you’re not alone.

Kirin, Japan’s largest
brewing company. reports that
a staggering 22 billion gallons of
beer were produced throughout
the world last year.

Kirin says that Europe ac—
counted for over 51 percent of
the Earth's total suds produc-
tion, followed closely by North
America. Central and South
America.

APE OVER COKE
Three rhesus monkeys, given
the choice of obtaining food or

asters

cocaine, reportedly opted‘
almost exclusively for the white
powedercd drug during an
eight-day experiment at the
Medical College of Virginia.

Science magazine reports that
the three simians were taught
how to push levers so that they
could obtain food by following
one pattern, or small amounts
of “coke” by performing
another.

According to the magazine,
for the eight days of the ex-
periment, all three of the
monkeys “almost exclusively"
selected the drug. and ignored
the food completely. The ex-
periments were stopped, Scien-
ce says. because of “concern for
the health of the animals.”

Project Director Doctor
Robert Balster says he believes
monkeys choose cocaine for the
same reason people do:
"Because it makes them feel
good."

cacti-EATEns

Americans have become ac-
customed to artificial colorings
and artiﬁcial flavorings in their
diets. The next invention on the
horizon: Artifical smells for
foods.

The Miami Herald reports
that a leading chemical firm is
perfecting aroma capsules that
can be added to processed foods
to make them smell better.

According to the copyrighted
news report, one spice ﬁrm has
developed a method to enclose
mouth watering aromas in tiny
capsules which disintegrate and
release the smell into foods at
just the right temperature.

The Herald says some of the
aroma ingredients are natural.
while others are synthetic, but
that the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has ruled they will
require no special regulations
governing the artiﬁcal aromas.

EXPANDING JEANS

The ﬁrst, but perhaps not the
least expensive “Made in
Hungary" Levi jeans have
made their debut in Budapest.

A factory set up jointly by
Levi Strauss and Hungary’s
communist government is
making the jeans with material
supplied by Levi’s San Fran-
cisco office.

Hungary is expecting to put
out some four million jeans in
the next few years, at a whop-
ping $53 a pair.

SCIENCE ANXIETY

If the subject ol' science scares
the water out ol' you, you're not
alone.

Researchers at Loyola.
University report they have
discovered that thousands of
normally highly-intelligent
college students suffer from
what they call “science
anxiety."

According to J.V. Mallow of
Loyola's Physics Department
many students suffer virtual in-
tellectual blackouts when it
comes to dealing with a science
or math question. Mallow says
most of this anxiety is caused by
previous sex or ethnic group
discrimination encountered by
students, family and career
pressures, and even society's
distorted image about science
and technology.

Loyola has launched a series
of “science anxiety clinics" at
the University in which anxious
students meet with scientists
and psychologists. Mallow says
the cure rate for “science
anxiety" appears to be very
high.
