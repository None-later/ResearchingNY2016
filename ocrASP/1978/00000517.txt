Hmoteur ﬁtting Devol

peaking of streetwalkers and actors,
Alexander Woollcott once said:
"The two oldest professions in the world
-— ruined by amateurs." The Perfor-
ming Art's Center's recent staging of
Bertol Brecht’s The Three Penny Opera,
3 play populated by those of the former
professionl perfectly illustrated
Woollcott's point about the latter.

Gary Douglas
Laurie Srrﬂgn

The Three Penny Opera is a vibrant
play; a scintillating satire exuding color-
ful, bawdy characters whose vivacity
draws the audience into their resonantly
kinetic, albeit sordid, piece of life. The
PAC's production of the play, however,
fell far short of cffcctuating any sense of
an animated, impetuotis “piece of life."
Sobriety. rather than sonority set the
tenor of tiie acting, and the dynamic
potency of Brecht and Weill’s songs
was lost in the failed efforts of limited
and unemotive vocalists.

The major failing with the PAC’s
production was the acting. The play is
teeming with characters scattered about
various parts of the stage. It is essential
that characters react obviously to one
another. that they convey a sense of
awareness of the surrounding action,
that they react and respond to one
another. This was not done effectively.
The actors failed to make their charac-
ters come alive within the context of a
scene. There was no interaction. The ef—
fect was that of a bunch of people
reading through Brecht’s play, barking
out lines as if practising in front of a
mirror.

Not one of the actors presented a
ﬂeshy. vibrant character for their
audience to emphathize with. Lines were
recited, roles were not portrayed. The
street singer (Jeffrey Dunetz) conveyed
no intensity: the sharp look in his eye
was absent, his contempt for MacHeath.

tively portrayed.

The character of Polly Peachtim,
(Theresa Landi) on the other hand, was
overacted. Miss Landi lacked any sen-
sitivity towards her character: Polly, a
naive innocent. was portrayed as a bab-
bling ninny, whose whining and
screeching would try the patience of the
most tolerant ofuudiences.

Kevin Scott Ferentz’s portrayal of
MacHeath was also flawed. He failed to

_ convey the villain's underlying cowar-

dice. MacHeath is not the perfect
criminal: he is competent only with his
knife. Ferentz was negligent in his ultra-
suave characterization. He played
MacHeatli as MacHeath would like him-
self to be portrayed.

There were, however, a few perfor-
mances that rose above the level of
mediocrity which typified most of the
characterizations. Laura Nicholls and
Richard E. Stranford were fine as Mrs.
and Mr. I’cachum. Stranford effectively
brought I’eachum to life. and was very
expressive in spots though he often lost
'his intensity.

By far the best performance, however,
was put in by Christopher Wolfe who
played Money Matthew, a member of
MacHeath’s gang. Wolfe is an outstan-
ding actor who outshined the rest of the
cast. He portrayed his tiny part with real
sincerity and sensitivity.

The singing on the whole was horren—
dous. Nicholls‘ (Mrs. Peachum) voice
.was terribly strained due to her small
range. On the “Song of Dependency"
she was incapable of reaching several
low notes. All the singers with the excep-
tion of Landi and Rebecca Nikolski
(Jenny) were hardly adequate. They
were unemotive and lacked any vibran-
cy. Rather than elevating the play’s
dramatic heights, the singing con-
tributed to the lifeless aura that per-
vaded the production.

The production did have its attributes.

The orchestra effectively captured the
sense of the bawdy English music hall
flavor that Brecht intended. The
arrangements were dynamic and precise.
The costumes were imaginative and well
done. The set design was perfect, giving
the effect of an impressionist painting. It
lent itself to the production, and its con-

struction was ingenious.

Three Penny Opera is a brilliant.
exciting play, but in the case of the
PAC’s recent
lifeless. It was afflicted and effectively
ruined by the malady that is amateur ac-
