“lhey mixed it up extremely
well." said Sicdlecki. "and that

that lclt the linebackers out ol

A 20-yard Francois draw
narrowed the Alhain lead to 27-25.
It then took the Danes a bit over

0 ninners in the top l9 and held
the third team spot. Dalton
whipped all potential challengers
and stretched a 50-yard lead at the
midway point to more than a
football field in the end.

Riley made up ground in the
second hall" 0' the race after
trotting along 15th at the two-mile
juncture. At that point. Dalton was
running a 9:41 race with an outside
iihot at John Biedrzycki‘s record of
24:35.9 set in the 1974 lilviitational.
His victory was never in doubt-and
the lack of an impetus may have
squashed any new standard. .

“From the way I felt. l could
probably have cut my time by
about 30 seco'ndsland maybe more
with a good push." said Dalton.
“l‘ll have to slice my time
considerably to qualify for the
nationals still. We‘re Division I in
track so I‘ve got to compete with
Penn. and Villanova runners in the
qualiiying meet."

Amid the celebrat'ive
atmosphere. crowds and perfect
conditions beckoned for the stellar
performances and they were treated
