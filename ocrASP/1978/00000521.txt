Women’s Soccer Club Off Slowly

by Janet E. Cerni

Albany State‘s premier women‘s
varsity soccer club saw its record
drop to 0-5—l lollowing a 4-0 defeat
at the hands ol‘ Springﬁeld Club
Soccer on Saturday afternoon.

A pair of goals in each halt by
Springlield women proved to he
the undoing ol Coach l)ch Havens‘
squad. llavens had predicted that
her team "would stay in the game
and not lull way behind“ and it did
just that. contrary to the linal
score.

lhe Danes hustled on the Iield
and kept up with and occassioiially
dominated the pace ol the game.
which was on the most part
controlled by Springlicld.

lhe lirsl goal ol the game. which
lrcshman goalie lioiinic Kunner
was in line to stop. was

unlortunately dellccted oil the legs'

ot a teammate at an tingle which
Kanncr was unable to cover. _
lhe Danes‘ inexperience, which

Havens cites as her team‘s most
damaging weakness. played a rolel
in the Springﬁeld victory as Albany
encountered numerous difficulties
in establishing drives towards its
goal.

Very intelligent

“Our strength.“ said Havens.
“lies mostly in attitude since we still
have a lot 01 skills-to- work on.
We‘re a very intelligent team.
however, you can't use what you
know unless you have the skill.
the skill Will grow as the years go
on."

Prior to their most recent detettt.
the Danes lost to Colgate
University. the University ol
Rochester. Cortland State and the
University ol Vermont llavcns lcli
that the best game ol the year was
the season‘s opener with Colgate in
which Albany lell Hi. lhe squad's
one tie came against Cornell
University by a 2-2 score.

"We do well against relatively

new teams. but schools such as
Cortland. Rochester. and Vermont
who support highly developed tour
and ﬁve year old varsity teams are
out oi our league."said Havens.
lhey‘re JUSi a little too much for
us. but you have to start
somewhere Next year we’ll be
playing schools more on our own
level so the schedule won't be so
one sided."

Havens indicated tiiat llte chance
at attracting lrcshinen and translcr
women who enjoy playing soccer
and have experience with the game
WI“ he greater now that the team is
an organi/ed one. "lhis year Wt:
drew very tew with any
experience." said Havens

Junior captains l.iI Kirk and
Lyne Larrabee lead the chili. which
will remain as such tor ti three-year
trial period, ill which time there
Will he the option at moving up to
varsity team status. or remaining as
a club.
