Dullness Surrounds Boater- Win

by Ken Kurt:

“It was a dull game, a matter of
how much we could win by." said
Albany State soccer coach Bill
Schicit'clin. aptly summing up how
his 7-4—2 Dunes beat the visiting
University of Buffalo 2-0 on
Saturday.

Scoring opened at 14:30 at the
ﬁrst half as Albany‘s most
persistent offensive throat. Carlos
Arango. slammed home the initial
goal. Albany had numerous other
scoring opportunities in the first
half but couldn‘t put the ball into
the not. "We dominated the game.
but We missed a lot of good shots.
They played well. but we were hurt
by it number of ot‘t'sidcs culls." said

Schicft'elin.

Jorge Aguilar had no trouble
littdingthc not at l2:07 of the second
hali‘ for an insurmountable lead
over the weaker Buffalo team. Pepe
Aguilar. Hector Rovito and Alex
Pngano did a line job on defense
for the Danes. as evidenced by the
few and tar between number of
Buffalo shots. Albany out‘ehot
Bult'alo Iii-5, and Dario Arango
picked up his fifth shutout of the
season.

The Great Dane hooters host
crosstown rival RPl in
Wednesday's regular season ﬁnale
at 3 pm on the upper soccer ﬁeld
behind Dutch Quad. “KPI is 6-4
and very much improved. They [arc
