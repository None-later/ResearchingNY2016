LAKE PLACID. N.Y. (AP) The.
Gilbane Building C0,. of
Providence. R.l.. the overseer of all
non-state controlled building for the
I980 Winter Olympics here. was
audited at its own request last
month. the Associated Press has
learned.

The audit. by the Arthur Ander-
son firm. one of the largest in the na-
tiort. was completed in October.
However. the final draft ofthe audit
has not been completed. and officials
do not intend to make it public.

“ I here have been inferences in the
papers that there have been im-
propritics. illcgtilities.“ said Ramon
Lopez. project federal manager for
Gilbilt‘lc. “But the audit found
nothing improper.“

Olympic Organizing Committee has
been criticized for its accounting
piocedures. A suit was filed in state
Supreme Court in Rochester. by two
fund-raising companies ullcgingthat
the organizers mishandled funds ina
special bank account.

Others have charged nepotism.
attd conflict of interest in the letting
of insurance - policies. and a US.
Iicottomic Development Ad-
ministration audit of the committee
was concluded recently.

The audit questioned some travel
expenses and accounting practices.
btit found nothing illegal.

"Let's say someone said there was
it scandal in your own office." Lopez
said.

  Olympic Builders Ask For Audit

Lopez said that while he expected
the final draft shortly; it would not
be made public.

Gilbanc is a private construction
firm. contracted by the organizers to
overiee building at sites including
the new I'ieldhouse. the ski jumps.
and the Olympic Village. Gilbane is

not doing any of the construction
itself. but hires other contractors,
Lopez said.
I Possible Conﬂict

The only area of possible conﬂict
which has arisen concerning the
Oilbane company has been. in con-
itcctlon with the Olympic Village.
which is to become a medium-
sccurity federal prison after the
games. Much of the money being
used for construction ofthe complex
at nearby Ray Brook comes from the

Unanimous Rulings

, it list of Monroe County workers laid

oll during it budget cutback earlier
this year. the county had argued
that release of the list of more than
I00 workers would cause them per-
.sonul or economic hardship.

the Court of Appeals upheld a
ruling by the Appellate Division of
State Supreme Court. however.
holding that that was not enough to
halt release of the list. The lower
court said the county. under the law.
must also show that the records “are
trot relevant or essential to the or-
dinitry Work“ of the county in order
to be excluded trom release.

Some have questioned whether it
is proper for Gilbane. which was not
selected through competitive bid-
ding. to administer federal money,
evcrt though it is not involved in the
actual building.

“We're not the contractor up
here," said Lopez, when asked about
the village. "We‘re up here in
management capacity. Our total
staff consists of administrative per-
sonnel."

Corning said it is not realistic to
save all the Pine Bush area. “Pine
llush was already cut bythe thruway
and Washington Avenue before peo-
ple realized it was there. I want to
save part.“

Elaborating on his position. Cor-
ning defended private enterprise.
saying backers of the shopping
center could build “wherever they
wanted.“ He added that with the
large belt of shopping centers
already in the area that “one more
shopping center wouldn't hurt."

The mayor also spoke about his
newly submitted budget for the up-
coming ﬁscal year. explaining that
although it was submitted on Tues-
day. it was only partially complete.

With election day less than a week
away. Corning made his prediction
for the gubernatorial election. saying
that incumbent Hugh Carey would
win by “a good. comfortable
margin." He said that Carey is “a
good darn governor despite the fact
that he didn‘t build up the govern-
ment the way Ire wanted to.“

Corning explained that he has
served 40 years as mayor because of
his background and his interest. “It‘s
just hcittg durable. I have it quick
mind. a good education. and come
from a family of politicians. I love
the work. It's ti lot of fun.“
