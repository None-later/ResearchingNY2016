SEX-AGENARIANS “

A survey of male corporate'ex-
ecutives whose ﬁrms moved away
from New York City found that
many of the 50- to 65-year-old ex-
ecutives reported ﬁnding "increased
sexual vigor" in their lives.

The survey of 180 executives
whose ﬁrms recently relocated out-
side Ncw York City was conducted
by Rober Barratt of the Schlesinger
Company in Clinton. New Jersey.

According to corporate officers.
among the greatest benefits in es-
tablishing a suburban corporate
headquarters was that they were now
closer totheir homes. This gave them
time. they said. for what they
described as “matinee sessions" with
their wives.

The executives generally reported
that the move not only helped their
sex lives. but also improved their
physical and mental well-being.

NEUROTIC NED

A New York advertising con-
sultatnt says he plans to begin
marketing the ﬁrst doll with psy-
chological problems, a doll he will
call “Neurotic Ned.“

Marketing specialist Harvey
Rosenberg says that Neurotic Ned
will come complete with his own vial

of valium. . .

Rosenberg is the same adult toy
promoter who‘s pushing the “Gay
Bob" doll. which comes packaged
along wit.h_a closet to come out of.
Rosenberg has also announced plans
to offer what he calls “the ﬁrst doll
with a pot belly."

LEFT-ON

You might say it was the best left-
handed compliment a pop group
could receive.

The four members of the Manhat-
tan Transfer. all ofthem left-handed.
have been appointed Ambassadors-
At-Large by left-Handers Inter-
national. a worldwide organilation
based in Topeka. Kansas.

According to Manhattan
Transfer's lead singer Tim Hauser:
"We'll be doing our bit toward rais—
ing left-handed consciousness."
Added Hauser. With a clenched ﬁst
gesture: "Left-on. baby."

HE’S SO VAIN

A New York cosmetic surgery
specialist says that at least 35 percent
of the people seeking cosmetic sur-

 

gery are men.

Doctor Gerald Imber says that IO
to 20 years ago. men represented a
mere IO to 20 percent of the practice.
Now. he says "older men are having
face lifts and the bags under their
eyes removed. Youngermen are hav-
ing nose jobs and hairtransplants."

Doctor lmber says that most men
compared with women "are babies
when it comes to surgery." which in-
cidentally is not cheap.

Prices run from $3000 to $5000 for
a full face lift and eyelids. SISOO to
$3000 for nasal reshaping. and $20 a
plug for a hair transplant.

COLLEGE CAUTION

You might soon be reading this
warning on top of college applica-
tion forms: “Caution: A college
degree may be hazardous to your
marriage."

Three-hundred-sixty-one married
women who returned to school after
having children were surveyed by the
University of Michigan. The
research revealed that a surprising

proportion of the womeh found that
their new found academic interests
were hurting their marriages.

The survey found that 45 percent
of the women. or nearly half of them,
believed that their return to college
caused them to be less satisﬁed with
their marriages. Another 20 percent
of the women interviewed had ac.
tually divorced their husbands since
entering school.

The author of the study. Psy-
Chologist Gail Berkove, says that
problems can occur in a marriage
when a wife returns to the college
classroom and undergoes changes
while her husband is stuck in ajob he
doesn‘t like. Berkove adds that in
about half the cases studied. the
results of returning to college were
seen as positive to the marriage.

A CLEAN SWEEP
Here‘s a story that should delight
any apartment renter who has failed
to have a cleaning deposit returned
after moving out and leaving a clean
apartment behind.

It started back in I973 when a 23-
year-old law student in Sacramento.

aa¢<q~w~e-”-. s . . . , ..,,..,J..J,.-,._

EWS

,. ;,~;vt,Calitornia~ named Terry Sundkvist
’ - was informed that his $50 cleaning»

deposit would not be reimbursed.
even though he hadleft his former
apartment spotless.

Sundkvist didn't take that deci-
sion lying down. He ﬁled a claim in '
small claims court for the deposit
plus $200 in punitive damages, and
won.

However, his former landlord, the
Sacland Company. was foolish
enough to fail to pay the courtjudge-
ment. So in I976. Sundkvist
petitioned the County Marshal's of-
fice to auction off the apartment
complex to meet the court judge-
ment. ' .

The landlord inexplicably ignored
the notice of sale. so Sundkvist
showed up at the auction himselfand
picked up the title on the 95-unit
apartment building for a mere S450.

Finally. ,lut year. the Sacland
Companywbelatedly realized what
had happened when'the Company
tried to sell the apartment complex
and found it couldn't. At last report.
Sundkvist. who is now an attorney in
Portland. had turned down an offer
from Sacland uf$l0.000 to clear the
title. He says he wants more. And it
all started over that $50 cleaning
deposit.
