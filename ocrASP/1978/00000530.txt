ALBANY

 

 

continued from [rant page

hopeful for a playoff bid with a 5-2

record. have developed an intense

rivalry with Ithaca. Twice they have

4 met, and Albany has not scored a
poiitt in losing both times. For the
Danes, a victory over the Ithaca
Bombers would be an absolute
achievement —— an emotional as well
as physical triumph.

ltliaca. meanwhile. has the oppor
tunity to defend their number-one
ranking. and has a chance to ex-
tinguish the Danes' post season
hopes completely. Basing their
program on what Ford calls “art im~
pressive history and a great football
heritage," the Bombers see Albany
as one obstruction in tlteir quest for
a national championship.

Knocking Ithaca from the ranks of
the unbeaten will be Albany's most
arduous task of the season. The
Bombers have “no real weakness."
according to Dane coach Mike
Welch. and have “the best defeiiSe
we've seen and an awesome running
attack." Finding it difficult to single
out individual strong points. Welch
stated that “a good way to put it is
their outstanding players are stari-
douts among standouts."

Many of those standouts reside
on the Ithaca offensive unit, which
has been charging through their op-
ponents for over 31 points a game.
The Bombers line up iii a multiple I
formation and utilize the triple op»
tion, which reveals a basic offensive
game-plan. “They are a running
team, and they beat the living hell
out'of people," said Welch. who
scouted Ithaca last week and saw
them pulverize Hobart 49«O.

Owning a backfield that has run
rampant against all opposition,
Ithaca comes at the Danes 4-4
defense with three superb ball
carriers. Quarterback Doug
Bencsko (6’3", 180) is in the lineup
for a sole purpose — to use his legs
to move upfield. “He's the best run-
ning quarterback we've seen," said
Welch. who himself was a member
of the Ithaca backfield a few years
back. “They like it when he carries
the ball."

The Ithaca passing game has been

virtually non-extstent this season.
Usually lining up alongside Mees
is John Nicolo, who is the Bombers'
leading scorer this year and a true
breakaway threat. However, it was
learned Thursday by Albany Sports
Information Director Gary Swatling
that Nicolu tore knee ligaments iii
last week's Hobart contest and Will
not see any action tomorrow. Junior
Doug Cretku (5'10". Itib) will fill in
for his riijured teaniiiiale, aitd has
"the talent tostart on any Divrsronlll
team." according to Welsh.
wrth Bencsko throwing less than 30
times the entire year. This statistic is
.i reflection on the Bombers'
‘ttlpt't‘tnr ground assault. Rushing at
will against every team they have
l.ii't',(l, Ithaca Iias no need to put the
ball in the arr. Compiling an eye-
popping 480 yards on the ground
last week, they attempted only
seven passes.

"Until someone proves they can
stop them on the ground they won't
pass the ball." commented Siedlicki.
"They'll even run the ball on third
and long."

“Bericsko's not a really good
passer." added Welch. "He looks
like he can throw the ball well. but
he's not very successful completing
his tosses."

Complementing Bencsko's
groundwork are a pair of junior run-
iiirtgbacks who form a dynamic one‘
two punch: Matt Mees(5'l l",210)is
the second leading career rusher in
Ithaca itistory. and is their most
prolific back this season. "He's a
good one," said Siedlicki. "He gains
his yards mostly through inside
runs. and they have specially design-
ed plays for him. Once he gets going,
he's tough to bring down."

An oddity in the Ithaca backfield is
the third member ofthe running cor~
ps. Senior Steve Ludwig (5'1 1", 198)
has carried the ball a grand total of
two times in his team's eight games.
His contribution. however, is an in‘
tegral part of lthaca's precision
movement.

“He's probably the best blocking
back I've ever seen," said Siedlicki.
"He never touches the ball. but we'll

really have to take him on when he
comes out to block."

Paying the way for the ballcarriers
is an offensive line that also qualifies
for the “best-ever" category. "They
.rre a lot like our offensive line. plus
It) pounds per player," said Welch.
"'I'Iiey're extremely well coached
and aggressive.

" They seem almost unstoppable
on the ground. Deleiistvely. we're
going to have to contain the backs
and tr'y to maktI lieticsko tliiow the
ball. I don't think they can beat us
completing only one or twopasses.

" The key defenstve position will
be out defenstve ends," added
Siedlicki. "Both (Jriit) Dignari aitd
(ILLI) l't'dttlltllttt have to stay on their
feet and get outside."

“We know that we've got to stop
their quarterback from running at
will." said Digrian. "He's the key to
their offense."

"If he (Bencsko) runs. he's gonna
get stuck." said defensive tackle

 

1

Larry Pearson. “Our defense is
geared for the run. What we've gotta
do is stick, stick, stick."

Ithaca fields a defensive squad
that has been nothing short of sen-
sational this season. Allowing only
48 points in eight games this season
from their 5-2 defensive setup, the
Bombers possess a group of well
conditioned athletes that play
together as a disciplined unit. "They
don't move around too much on
defense" said Welch. "They just sit
there and beat you with the people
they have."

The single most exceptional
player on the Ithaca defense is at the
free safety position, where Scott
Coltori (6'1", 175) dangerously
roams. The senior co~captain holds
the career interception record at
Ithaca, and has defensive leeway in
the backfield.

“He Will catch the ball if it’s near
ltirn." said Welch. “He doesn't drop
any interceptions. and he has a real
nose for the ball."

Aiitolter position where there are
"standouts among standouts" is at
the linebacker spot, where John
lapei fti'lZ". 210) and cocaptain
.lohrt St'hiernaiiii (0'2", 220) corn-

and last year Schieinann won
honorable mention for All American
at his positoiri. Add a defensive Iiiie
that merely overpowers opponents
wttli their size and athletic ability.
and it results in a defensive unit that
can simply and effect iver extiitguish
any offensive advances.

"It's the best we've played against
all year." said Welch. “But they
haven't played againstatriple option
team like ours this season."

“I have no doubts we can run on
Iliern." added Dane offensive guard

Rich Aufeiro. “All we travel. .10.,
some out and hit harder than they
0...

"The key is to establish our
wishbone," commented halfback
Fred Brewington. “The past two
times we've played them they shut
clown our bread and butter."

An area that has been steadily
building for the Danes has been the
passing attack. and the improve.
ment must continue for Albany to be
successful against Ithaca. "We hope
to throw a little more," said Aldrich.
“The last time we played thent they
didn't honor our passing game Per.
sonally. I had a slump earlier rri the
year, but I feel I'm getting III the
groove." Tight end Ed Sellers added
that "Brad's been throwing the ball
with more confidence."

"If Aldrich has a good day." said
l-‘ord, "we'll be off arid running "

The Bombers also possess it lltll‘

secondary Saturday
afternoon at Bleecker Stadium.he.
will probably run into a very familiar
situation when John Veruto, his
brother. tries to knock him down.

“I really would enjoy that," said
Bob. a senior. “We worked out
together all summer and joked
about this gamea lot. I'll compliment
him if he makes a nice tackle on me.
but I'm confident that I'm gonna
break a long one on him."

The Endicott brothers will add
another dimension to the showdown
and possible carry out a little sibling
rivalry in their first meeting ever as

opponents on the football field. To
forestall any potential squabbles,
their parents will root on the Ithaca
side in the opening half. and then
transfer seats and loyalties to Dane
territory iii the second.

“I'll try to hit him just a little bit
harder out there," said John, the
blondhaired Dane junior, younger
of the two. “The funny thing is that
Ite'll be my key as the fullback, so I
have to follow him. He’ll be trying to
show on TV ltow good Ithaca is and
I'll be trying to prove how good
Albany is. It should be very in-
terestrng."

John was a tailback at Endicott
High and Bob played his normal
fullback slot. In Bob's final season.
they started together in the
backfield before he went onto
Nassau Community College for two
years. He left with the school

rushing mark. John was never it
standout rusher and said he knew he
wanted to play defense Wllt'll he

it an attempt to improve
the Albany State football
team's inconsistent
kicking game for
tomorrow’s showdown

' against Ithaca, Dario Arango. first-
, string goalie for the Dane's soccer
learn. is presently trying out for the
squad, according to head football
rcoacli Bob Ford.

Arango May Help Kicking Game

“We're definitely going to look at
him as a kickoff specialist," Ford
said. “Bill Schieffelin (soccer coach)
and Dario were both receptive to the
idea."

Scliieffelin was first contacted by
Ford on Monday. "He asked me if I
would object if Dario would dosome
kicking." said Scliieffelin. "If he cart
help oitt in some way then fine. I'm
going to go along with if. He cart kick
the hell otit of the ball."

Before starting soccer practice
one day, Aritngo kicker] some field
goals arid had some favorable
results, said Schiefleltn. "l‘le kicked
(if) yards. one was 70. I guess that ini-
pressed them." quipped the veteran
roach, who calls Arango “a hard-
uosed kid."

Albany football offensive coor-
rlinator Mike Motta indicated that
Ararrgo is allowed to play for both
the soccer and football teams. "As
lottg as he's a full-time student and is
not playing for a pro team. he is eligi-
ble," explained Motta.

l‘resently the soccer team is in
t'ttltltlttlttill for an NCAA post
season playoff bid and is playing for
the SUNYAC championship against
ISrockport on Tuesday. “If there was
it question of any problent, then
Dario wouldn't be able to play (foot
ball)." said Schieffelin.

Araiigo had a busy day Wednes~
day. After recording 'a 1‘0 victory
over Itl’l iii the Albany nets. he went
dowrt to practice less than art hour
litter. and worked on kickoffs.

Three other kicking specialists were
booting with Arango; Gary Ber titan.
Tony Lenkiewicz and Mike I.t‘Vt‘tI‘w

"I watched him tAi'airgo) for lb I’ll

coach Vince (Iai‘iii'vale. “We'll try to

A decision on Arattgo's football
status for the game tomorrow will be

Carnevale. If Aratrgo does make the

exclusively for kit'kofls. "We iloirlit

With Quiet Confidence,
Danes Await Challenge

By Paul Schwartz

ltere's no pounding on

lockers or loud threats of

destruction. The way in

which the Danes are

preparing for their show-
down with Ithaca takes on another
form one of quiet, mature
professionalism. For head coach
Bob Ford. the attitude is not a
surprising one.

"It's probably a reflection on my
personality. We're not a rah-rah
team —- we're quiet and '
businesslike. The attitude is ‘lets
work hard and get the job done."'

“We're a veteran team, and we
look at it realistically," said Kenny
l’aulo. "We’ve been there before.
and we know what we're capable of.
Ithaca is not on a pedestal—there
right there with us."

Ithaca enters the game with all
those startling statistics-enough
impressive numbers to make some
teams shake their heads and
wonder. The Danes heads have
doiie very little shaking.

Dave Mathis: “It drives a team to
reach for their potential. We believe
itt our selves, now we want to prove it
to them."

"The only statistics that count are
the ones they get against us." said
Ford.

Coming off last year’s NCAA
.,.  .

 

   

semifinal appearance. the Danes
have had highs and lows while
building a 52 record. With their past
success comes a certain amount of
confidence, even against a team of
lthaca's stature.

“We haven't beaten them before."
said Rich Aufiero. “They feel we're
not in their league. We‘re gonna
prove we are on Saturday,"

Fred Brewiiigton: "We'll be at an
apex come Saturday."

In order to come out on top
totiiorrow, the Danes must put
together not pieces of solid play. but
a totality of excellence.

"livery team can be beat, said
Levi Louis. “It will take a total team ef-
fort. We have to rise to the occa‘
sion."

"Each man has something to
prove." said Larry Pears
son."Everybody has to do their
thing. It will take every everything
we've gotrw a 200 percent effort."

Ford: "It's a great challenge.
Albany football teams have always
responded to challenges."

Even with the low-key manner
that the Danes have taken before
the game. there is still time and need
for some old fashioned “psyching
tip."

“It's starting to build," said
Mathis. “We started high on Mon-
day. but then we worked things
slowly. But By Friday night, we'll be
a wild bunch of fools."

n

 

iury. "But we've got three fine
quarterbacks and Doug Bencsko
has come on and done a fine job for
us back there."

It was a teeming South Hill Field in
Illiaca that witnessed Benscko's in
that start. With a roaring crowd of'
7,000 plus adding to the drama.
Clarion of I’enns'ilvania. carrying a
lit-game win streak and the Division
II label, provided the challenge. John

who picked up 80 yards in the game.
"'l‘licy thought they would come iii
to our field and blow us out. but we
were ready." The Bombers were
rolling wttli a cohesiveness frighten-
riig to opposing coaches, and their
mark was 50.

Another Div. II school.
Springfield. came next and Bencsko
solidified his starting spot in earnest
by galloping to I53 yards rushing on
a mere 11 carries.The 28-14 triumph
was directed by the 6-3 junior and his
long strides enabled him to outrace
lineman to the corners including one
sprint of 68 yards for atouchdown.

The last two weeks have seen a
pair of Ithaca victories by a com-
bined score of 103-0 over Canisius
and Hobart, respectively. Against
Hobart on Oct. 28, Mees totalled 86
yards. increasing his career total to
2160 and moving into second place
on the all-time school rushing |ist.ln-
dictive of their depth. third-string
tailback Bob Ferrigano had 90 yards
and two touchdowns.

"With the exception of the last
two weeks, we've had a tough
schedule that has tested us," said
Butterfield. "Now these next two
(Towson next week) may be our
toughest. Albany is a fine team that
is very well coached and should give
us a good indication of how good we
are. Right now I can't say if this team
is better than either the 74 or 75
squad."

This is a team that outgained
Canisius iii total yardage a couple of
weeks ago 519-89. They were so
dominant iii that win and the balance
was so prudent that six running
backs all topped the 60-yard rushing
level. Their defense has proceeded
unscathed since mid-October and
Colton has six interceptions playing
against ritostly rushing squads.

"We are having a great season,
but we're specifically making sure
we take these games one at a time
and don't look ahead to the
playoffs," said Mees. the fullback

best in the titlyard dash. “Albany is a
lot better than Buffalo and they
should have beaten Kings Point also.
No blowouts Saturday. just a good,
close game."

Now with the added attraction of
television, Ithaca will be more
motivated to showcase the destruc
five squad they possess. "Hey, it's
nice we're getting some recognition
after all we've done. now people can
see how we play." said second-
stiirig fullback Bob Veruto.

And oh, ltow they cart play.

Burger Hopes

By Rich Seligson

ack Burger wasa starting
halfback for Ithaca
College two years ago. In
tomorrow’s Albany-
Ithaca confrontation. he
will be starting at halfback again. But
this season Burger's in the Albany
backfield, and he's excited about the
challenge of playing against his old
rteammates.

“The game means as much to me
as anybody," Burger said Monday
morning. “There's still a lot of guys
that I knew that are still playing for
them. I think everybody on our team
has set their gtals a little bit higher
for this game."

Burger sees no crucial differences
between the two squads. “Overall
the personnel is pretty much the
satire. btit they have a little more
depth. l tltink we really can beat
them and a lot of guys think the
same way. Everyone's going to have
to play their best game of the year."

Fortunately for the 5-9. 175 pound

Burger. he is healthy enough to be
playing at all. After completing a
one-year stint at St. Thomas More
Prep School in Connecticut. where
the football against Division I and Il
junior varsity teams was "the best
I've ever played," Burger chose to
attend Ithaca. "I wanted to go
there." he said. "I knew they had
good football."

But what Burger didn't foresee
were torn ligaments in his shoulder.
an injury that” occurred on a kickoff
return in only his second game for
the Bombers. Advised by a doctor at
school that he wouldn't be able to

     

mg » ., U
play foot al anymore because of
nerve damage, Burger left after a
short stay.

Although a smaller community
than Albany. Ithaca receives much
better support at games, according
to Burger. "We need a lot of backing
from the students and the communi-
ty here." he said.

Choosing to take a semester off
from academics when he left Ithaca,
Burger spent the spring working. In
the fall he attend Orange
Cortimunity College, a school which
did not have a football team. "I just
worked out." said Burger. “I wanted
to give my shoulder a try. I figured I
had nothing to lose." He combined
Nautilus training at West Point with
sortie softball and basketball, and it
was a successful remedy.

Then Albany State appeared in
the picture.‘Witli the knowledge that
Albany head coach Bob Ford was
atteri'rptiiig to upgrade the Danes'
football program, Burger spoke to
Ford last spring and was convinced.

 

OncerAn Ithaca Bomber.

To Explode

So the blond-halred athlete was on
the road again. and after two months

he feels "things have worked out for

the best.

"These are the best guys I ever
played with personality-wise.
Everyone's pulling for each other. A V
lot of guys went out of their way to
make me feel comfortable." said
Burger.

When the Danes hosted
Middlebury in their second and ﬁnal
scrimmage, Burger showed no signs
of a burn shoulder. Accelerating at
the sight of an open hole, the
aggressive Burger ripped the op-
ponent‘s defense for roughly 150
yards. He was off to a tremendous
start running the football.

Sub-par blocking was an impor-
tant reason why he didn't start at
Kings Point in the season opener.
“Blocking has been the hardest
thing to adapt to." said Burger.
“Aside from running and catching
the ball, blocking is just as important
for the wishbone.”

In Albany's next game, a home
contest with Southern Connecticut
at Bleeker Stadium. the injury jinx

haunted Burger once again. He
twisted his ankle and was on
crutches instead of on the field at
Brockport the following week.
Burger made his return in the fourth
quarter against Buffalo a week later.
and led Albany to their only scoring
drive in the disastrous 15-8 upset
loss.

"Jack's an exciting running back."
said Dane assistant coach Mike

Welch. “He works extremely hard.

He's a 110 percenter."

Along with Levi Louis and Mike

      

Mirabella in the backfield, urger
has been a first-stringer the last two
games. Despite having a solid yard-
per-carry average, however. he has
had considerably fewer rushing
attempts than either Louis or
Mirabella.

Last weekat Cortland, Burger ran
the ball four times for 23 yards. com-
pared to Louis' 203 on 27 carries and
Mirabella's 131 on 15 rushes. "It is
not an intentional thing,” said
Welch. “We've been successful go-
ing to a certain side. And Levi and
Mike are both having great years.

“Jack's a potential game~breaker.
We'd love to get him the ball in the
secondary. I think he'll be ready
when the opportunity comes."

“It's been a bit discouraging," said
Burger. "It started off great. I know
what I can do."

Defeating Ithaca and earning
r-espeﬂm from his old teammates

might make Burger forget about his'

still-tender ankle and his prior scant
running chances. “If we win," Burger
said. “it will make the season."
