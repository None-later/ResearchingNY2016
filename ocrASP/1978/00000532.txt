ou'rc an Upstate news addict.
so what have you been doing
during the New York City
newspaper strike. now in its
86th day'.’
if you‘re like me. on weekdays you
l'idgct. you bite your nails and scowl as
you zip throtrgh the thin. anemic pages of
a local newspaper.
lint Sundays are the worst. You kick
the cat. yott curse. you hit down savagely
on your pipe. Only then do you resign
yourself to sitting down to read a local
Sunday newspaper. But you desperately
need a lix: that twenty-pound. buck-and—
a—quarter‘s worth ol the Sttnday New
\ork limes. So then you try going cold
turkey. but the \\lllttll’ilWill syniptomsjust
gct \sorsc. it's time tor desperate
Ittcttsttt‘cs.

Tim Spofford

 

l)cspctatton brought me to the Sunday
edition of the \\’asltington l’ost. probably
the strongest rival ol the limes as
America‘s newspaper of record. Nearly
three weeks into the strike last August I
stopped in the library periodical room for
a stale copy of the Sunday l’ost.

“Sol ry. sir." said the woman beltind the
desk. "but I‘m alraid we didn‘t pay our'
bill. and the library‘s subscription was
cancelled. liven libraries don't pay their
bills sometimes.“ she said with a smirk.
In early September I thought l‘dtry the
unitcrsity library again. I was in luck.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rick lastor, purchasing agent for the
library. said the bill was paid and the Post
was coming again.

“With the State of New York you don‘t
gct any money until the goods are
delivered." explained 'l‘astor in his first-
lloor library office. "And with those few
vendors who require prepayment v like l
assume the Post probably does -«-< it‘s a
very elaborate process we have to go
through to pay them before delivery. And
sometimes there are mistakes," he said.

So I hurried downstairs to bury myself

in the latest Sunday Post i could get my
hands on. Amazing. it was only Monday
and already the Sunday paper had arrived
by mail.

the Sunday Post is a good. quick-fix
read for a news addict. it has a hefty
business section. a respectable show
section, a fair book review and a modest
magazine. 'l'here‘s no equivalent of the
'limcs‘ Week in Review section. but the
Post runs a lot of clear. literate. in-depth
reportng that beats that repetitious
weekly wrap-up stuff.

Now I wanted to take this eighteen-
pound monster home and gorge myself.
Against the rules. I‘d ltave to get my own.

llonnd the Post’s telephone number in
the library‘s telephone book collection.
and called the number.

"In order to provide better service to
you. om' customer. the Washington Post
has installed a new tclcpltonc system."
droncd a taped message. “ l‘ltis has
resulted in the Washington Post changing

" | hunk you tor waiting. All circulation
lines are temporarily busy. if your paper
hasn‘t arrived. wait for the operator. If
you want tostop or start a paper,call 334-
asst) attd your message will be recorded

lixasperated. l dashed to the library.
got the number of another department at
the Post. scurried back to the phone and
dialed the new number. The operator who
answered was ahottt lto plug me into

wired me up with a real-life person
working in the Circulation Department.
“How can I go about getting the
Sunday l’ost mailed to me here in New

York State?" I asked.
“()ur mail subscriptions, sir. are
payable in advance.“ she said. “As soon as

t‘s not that disco sucks. lt‘sjust

that on the whole this genre

lacks outstanding musical

interaction and relies instead

on a heavy beat immersed in a
confused instrumental ﬂux. It is hOWevcr,
great. to dance to and The Village People
are at the top of the heap.

The group is the creation of producer
Jacques Morali. It consists of six guys
hired straight off the streets ofGreenwich
Village. They are solely vocalists with the
exception of Victor Willis who sings lead
as well as aids in their arrangements and
‘ helps Morali with lyrics. The music is
supplied by five musicians who don't have
“Village People" status but have
appeared on all three of the groups
releases.

 

Erlc Salzlnger

 

The real talent behind the group is
Morali. whose catchy rhymes, intriguing
lyrics and premier promotional ability
have skyrocketed the Village People to
the top of the disco charts.

The Village People‘s latest offering,
entitled Cruisin' is no exception. Willis'

This seemed like putting the cart before

voice shines through as it has on past hits.
most notably “San Francisco" from their

. debut album. Willis has superior phrasing

ability but, in the heat of a latin hustle.
that ability isn‘t really noticed, and Willis‘
vocal talent is somewhat wasted and
unapprcciated. Two songs on the current
album fully display Willis‘ talents: “My
Roommate" and the hit single
"Y.M.C.A.". both peppy disco offerings.

" A line from "Y..M.C.A." reads “it's fun to
. stay at the Y.M.C.A. where there‘s

everything for you men to enjoy." indeed
the group's homosexuality is expressed in
many of their songs; it is part of the
group‘s magic. of their mystique. Sex.
drugs and disco are the three topics they
sing about. but in their own simple way
they make a statement.

“curable problem of popping a pill for
every little thing; the fate of the
contemporary chic discomaniac.

Buy, he'd love to stop but until then
he'll have to have his ups, ups. ups and
downs."

The remainder of songs include a
medley of “the Women" and “l‘m
Cruisin' " with “Hot Cap" rounding out
the album. All the cuts on C‘rut‘sr‘rt' follow
closely with the style of the group‘s first
two releases. The slight difference that
does exist is the incorporation of much
heavier synthesizer work. This, however.
does not signilicantly change the group's
sound.

Morali and Willis are to be admired for
their free cspusal of their political
philosophies. While they can't be
characterized as deep. they offer an
alternative to the bland love songs and
campy melodies that tend to be diseo‘s
mainstay. While The Village People still
provide their listeners with music that is
good to dance to. the streetwise. cynical
wit which is apparent in their lyric enable
them to transcend that limit.

up by the early part of next week but
alter that it‘s anybody‘s guess.“

My guess back then was that the strike
would go on. 'I he last one in 1963 lasted
ll4 days. And by my count. if the current
strike ran that long. I might expect a

'l be Sunday Post has been a good read
this past month, but the subscription is
just about up. and again i face the spectre
of a week without a good paper. So
lnesday night i called l’omfort again
before renewing the Post.

“Any progress oti the stt'ikc talks?"

“Yes. a great deal of progress as a
matter ol tact." he said.. “It‘s possible
\vc‘ll reach a settlement this evening."

“ l lien when cart we count on a Sunday

"l ratltcr doubt this Sunday coming."
he said. "but xt Sunday is a real
likelihood c'rc waiting for a
ratification vote."

Next morning both sides announced a
"tentative" agreement on a new contract,
but this is the second time an interim
agreement had been reached. in mid-
October the first one fell through. just as
things were really looking good for us
news addicts.
