hich I refer is the current Governor of New

. hiicouriigeous ﬁght to do something he had
omised to do months before. The repeal of
health in: was the reason to the
hotographs and aecompanting publicity. l

not governor to receive a greater than

To be more speciﬁc. ltold her that we have

appointment would not be possible for at least
a couple of weeks. She then asked me if 1 had
spoken to Dr. Wclty. I told her that my
meeting with Dean Brown was not contingent
upon any past meetings with anyone else.

She then contradicted me by saying. “But
you must go through administrative

complaint into one simple sentence! I cannot
believe wliiit one must go throughjust to speak
with another person. Truly SUNYA‘s
bureaucratic system needs drastic
reconsideration and 11 general overhaul.

Endorsing the Danes

All of the rhetoric will soon be over. The pitches have been made, and

Lhc time to show true worth and put all of the words to the test is almost
ere.

Will there be promises which will lead to disappointment? Or will
there be victories for students and the community?

After careful consideration of the issues at hand, there is one slate
which should receive the full support of SUNYA students: the Great
Danes football team. ‘

The Dane slate is opposed by the incumbent Ithaca Bombers and the.

winner will be determined at Bleeker Stadium tomorrow.

The contrast between the two opponents is striking: the Bombers
represent the Conservative establishment, laden with money; while the
Danes tire the struggling underdogs still in need of campaign
contributions.

The issues are simple. The Danes claim that they will score more
points in four quarters of football than the ltliaca team will. The
Bombers feel otherwise. naturally.

lthu 'it is the favorite; their established organization has been able to
garner decisive victories iii key precincts this your. But the Great Danes

Votcr turnout will he ti key in the outcome of this brittle, that‘s for

lodgers for a while and support the Great Danes. against the powerful
lthucu machine. the Danes will need all their mental, physical and
emotional powers to be victorious. Those emotional powers would be
liciglitcncd if the buses that will be shuttling SUNYA students to the
gumc urc filled to capacity.

llcrc‘s wishing the very best to the Great Ditties in this quest m they
are surely a provcrt team that is full of surprises.

And if the Drincs‘ supporters come out irt full force tomorrow at
lilceker headquarters, the potential for success will be gr‘ritcr. And so
will tltc potential for a possible victory party afterwards.
