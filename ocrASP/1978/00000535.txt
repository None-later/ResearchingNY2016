laltcrcd last wcckcnd against a tough
Albany Law Squad. Iii-4.

It was a very hard flitting contest
by botit tcams. btrt law added the

\ictory.

Jim Nycrnchck scorcd thc only try
on a 41-yard run around the right
sidc.

lhc Albany Statc "B" side notch-
cd IttltilliCl’ tic. ,t-i. with a combined
tough dclcnsc and hard hitting to

catch a quick Albany Law Squad.

The "B" side now stands at 3—0-2.
This season has been quite promis-
ing with a combination of raw
rookies and a few veterans.

Dismal season

Thc“A“ side onthc othcrhand,is

FOOTNOTES: Iwo of the Danes‘
Division 1 opponcnts are ranked

Danes Need Help

continued/rm” pugu .ri.\'l¢'r'n
Bombers easily is a tall request. A
simple win will obviously help them
in the Lamberts, but possibly not do
hitch in the eyes if the NCAA peo—
ple. That would still leave Albany
with two losses and Ithaca and St.
lAtWrchL‘ with protrany just one.
Western Maryland would then be
the only undclcntcd tcam.

"If wc were coming in with just
onc loss. thc garnc would be a great
tlctcrnrinant lnr thc NCAA berth,"
mid Dane COHLll Bob Ford. "There's
a little punch takcn out since we suf-
lcrcd the Buffalo loss. If we were to
win big, it would put us right back in
thc picturc. But it will stilldcpcnd on
St lxtwrcncc and Ithaca's last game."

chcrai of thc tcums ranked above
Albany in the Lurnhcrt Bowl have
one loss, btrt tlrcir rclativcly weak
schcdulcs would cnablc the Danes to
make a big Icap with an lthaca vic-
tory. according to l'lcllcr: last year,
Albany was ncvci' any higher than
fourth in lltc Lambcrt bill they got
lllc vital NCAA bid; so numbcr-onc
Is lltll ilL'L‘L‘SSill')’.

“Wc includc .scvcral NAlA

‘nllllOitttlly: San Jose State (I It and
llartwick (2 | )). Schicffclin pr'cdictcd
before the season that if his team had
. no mor'c than four lossch. it would
get an NCAA bid. The winncr ofthc
NY-NJ bracket goes into the (‘ham-
pionslrip game. The RI’I ginnc was
almost delayed because of vandalism
to the goals. but the "grounds crew"
had them in shape by garlic timc.

To Make NCAA ’s

achools in the Lambert and along
with somc New England schools,
they rcfusc to go to the NCAA‘s
anyway.“ Hcllcr said. "Right now, i
would have to list Ithaca, St.
[xtwrcncc and possibly Wcstcrn
Maryland as ahcad of Albany. Who
knows, the NCAA could always
dccidc tojust scnd one from Ihc East
that would finish Albany."

The main point continually
cmcrging hch and apparently
resting hard on pollstcrs' minds is
the deﬂating loss to Buffalo l5-8
back on Oct. 14. Stiles, Heller and
Ford all bounded on that game in
thcir analysis of the playoff situa-
tion. It's hard to convince the NCAA
commiltcc that mud caused the loss;
rcsults. records and schedules are
what muttcrs.

“Albany first has to beat Ithaca,
no doubt about that much." conclud-
cd Hcllcr. “if Towson can beat
Ithaca. and St. Lawrence can lose to
Rochester. Albany would look very
good." it sccms like a lot of things
have to go pcrfecily according. to u
prcscribcd blueprint for thc Dancs
to cvcn have a shot.
