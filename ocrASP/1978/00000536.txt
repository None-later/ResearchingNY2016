JV Gridders Fill] 32-20
To A Powerful Nassau CG

by Mike Dunne

Albany State's junior varsity foot-
ball team traveled to Hofstra Un-
iversity one week ago to faoea tough
Nassau Community College team.
and came away the losers by a 32-20
count

Playing under the lights for the
ﬁrst time this season, the Danes took
an early l4-O lead. The offense, led
by quarterback Mike Fion'to,
marched the ball in for touchdowns

on each oftheir first two possessions.

Nassau.described as “big and very
physical" by Dane coach Mike
Walsh. came back strongly late in
the half. Their ﬁrst score came on a
long scoring pass after which they
missed the PAT.‘

A field goal later in the half made
the score 14-0 in favor of the Danes
at intermission.

The home team secured the lead
for the ﬁrst time. as theyscored early
in the third period. Asuccessfultwo-
point conversion gave Nassau a
three-point lead at l7-l4.

the hosts got another touchdown

to up their lead to It) points. The

Danes recovered, however, with six
points of their own to narrow
the deﬁcit to 24—20.

Nassau scored again late in the
game to almost put Albany out of
reach. But the Danes marched down
the ﬁeld once more as the clock ran
down. Led by the running of Chuck
Priore and Dave Warhite. and the
passing combination of Fiorito to
Jim Votruaw. Albany advanced the
ball to the Nassau line with little time
remaining.

Danes Held

Nassau held the Danes on downs
because the offense play calling was
hampered by a lack of time outs.

“We looked good and played pret-
ty well." said Walsh. “Nassau is a
good football team."

Walsh cited John DiBari. Bruce
Collins, John Baldwin and Kareem
Hassan as playing very well defen-
sively against Nassau.

The loss drops the jayvees to 2-5
on the season. They will face a
another tough opponent today when
they host Division lfoe Colgate at 2
pm.
