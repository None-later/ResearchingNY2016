Arango Heads “Boaters Over RP]

by Ken Kurt:

A nail biter with all the
characteristics of a classic thriller
lrom the Albany rooter's point of
view. "It was a heart stopper." said
Albany State soccer coach Bill
Schieffelin as he described the
booters‘ well-earned I-0 victory over
crosstown rival Rl’l Wednesday
afternoon.

The winning goal game at 43:38 of
the second half with a scant l:22 left
to play in the Danes' regular season.
Robert Dahab took the ball down
the right side. and crossed it over
with a fine arc kick. Carlos Arango
was well positioned on the doorstep.
and he headed the ball pasta leaping
R l’l goalkeeper. freshman Ed
lianm. for the Dane victory.

Ihe goal was Arango‘s lllh ofthe
season. and his four assists add up to
make him the Danes' leading'scorer
\\ ith l5 points. "The team played ex-
tremely well under pressure. and

:

 

Carlos ciime through for us with the
winner." said Schieffelin.

Albany totttlly dominated the
game. but just couldn‘t manage to
put the ball into the net. The hooters
had 23 shots on lvanov and he came
up with an incredible I7 saves.
“Rl’l's goalie did a helluva job for
them." said Scliieffelin. "'I'heir
team's aggressiveness and fine play is
what shut off our many scoring op-
portunities, We couldn't capitali/e
on the scoring chances which
inateriali/ed."

Ahaoni Zemani played well tip
front for the R l’l hooters. On one
play. a foul up between fullback
lifram Neraj and Albany goalie
Dario Arango courted disaster for
the Danes. As Nelaj and Arango let
the ball slip by them. the RH booter
blasted the ball over the net instead
of grounding it into the open net for
a goal which would have been dis-
astorous for the Danes' NCAA tour-

the governors mansion four more
years as be easily defeated
Republican challenger Perry Duryea
in the race for governor Yesterday.

With 40 per cent of the vote
counted, Carey led Duryea 56 per
cent to 44 per cent.

Duryea conceded defeat at about
I2 midnight. over two and one half
hours after CBS liad projected Carey
the winner.

(‘arey supporters at his campaign
headquarters at the Statler Hilton
had to play a waiting game while the
Duryea camp refused to concede.
claiming that the election was “too
close to call.“ While they waited
Mario Cuomo. New York Mayor Ed
Koch and newly elected/\ttorney
(icnernl Robert Abrams spoke to the
supporters. Cuomo called the vic-
tory“One of inlegrityand principle."

It was the culmination of it long
and hard campaign. The Hugh
{Carey campaign workers had waited
ilorig time for this night ~and once
it came. they had to wait even longer
for Republican challenger l’erry
Duryeii's concession speech.

Koch landed the campaign as a

1“brilliant one." iind said “We not
only have a governor. mayor.
president from the same great party.
btit We're all friends. .7

The Carey headquarters. housed
at the Statlcr Hilton began to fill
with campaign and media personnel
shortly before the polls closed at 9:00
lpm. The (irand Ballroom of the

running mate. Mario Cuomo. red.

and blue streamers and

:balloons. A vast array of'television

cameras. monitors and lights
pointed towards the stage upon
which stood a huge Carcy-cuomo
banner.

About 20 minutes after the polls
closed. CBS projected that Hugh
Carey would be the winner. This was
announced to the campaign workers
who burst into cheers. The air of
confidence which had pervaded the
ballroom was not without merit. The
suspence was over quickly. the elec-
tion had been won. Now remained
only the wait for the opposition con-
cessioit speech.

llut it Wits to beti long wait indeed.
'I he campaign workers flanked
nrount TV sets giving election results
and milled about. The drinks were
flowing freely and at a goodly price -
$2.70 fora mixed drink. $1.25 for a
coke.

One campaign worker from

Queens wasjubilant. “It didn't seem ‘

like we had any competition.“ he
said. “At the end it scctncd like
Duryea was groping at straws."
towards the back of the ballroom
stood a trio engaged in conversation.
One stood out as a true Carey-a bur-
ly Irishman. He had thick eyebrows
and curly white hair. His build was
one of a spark plug. with a stomach
the size of a beer keg. One button
fastened his jacket as a blue ﬂannel
shirt and tattered tic gave him his
formal attire. He held a lialf of a
cigar. “I'm it very big Carey sup-

uporter." he said. "Now ya can't use
my name. but I sure am glad he won.
Will i celebrate? I‘m celebratin'
already!" be said raising his drink.

The most talkative man ofthe trio
was Jack Delaney. an aide to Carey‘s
campaign manager John Burns.
Delaney has worked in many cam-
paigns. and headed John F.
Kennedy's New York State head-
quarters in the I960 presidential
election. “The organiration of this
campaiin was very good." said
Dclaney. “The heavy issues of the
campaign such as the death penalty
seetned to die down. Half way
thronin the campaign Duryea was
on the defensive. Once that happens.
you‘re sunk."

llic third member of this group
was (ius Livona. the Vice President
of the 32nd Local of the Building and
Mantaiiitince Union. "We helped
Carey.“ he said. "The boys down at
the 32nd and all the campaign
workers and unions - that wins elec-
tioiis.

lhe lime wore on and there was
still no word from Duryea camp. An
older couple began to dance while
the alcohol served to loosen up many
campaign workers. Duryca’s camp
lheniinnounced that the election was
"too close to call.“

“He‘s gotta be kidding." bellowed
one worker. and the waiting game
continued. Mario Cuomo then arriv-
cd on the scene and gave a basic
politican speech. Although they
knew it was a victory. Cuomo said
they iitid to wait for Duryea‘s conces-
sion. Cuomo was then presented
with a titediil from members of the

from "Rocky."

"It's good politics with Carey bein‘
an lrislitniiii and Cuomo Italian."
Delaney said. But what of Carey's
shabby treatment of Cuomo last
year“! Delaney shrugged. “That‘s
politics.“ he said.

Koch and Abrams'ttlso arrived
and made speeches to please the
crowd. The band played. the cam-
paign workers drank and everyone
still waited.

Misty-Eyed Duryea Concedes At Midnight

For a time. Republican election

filled with optimistic talk. State
Republican Chair Bernard Kilborn

there was no rooin left for even

In the end. victories were
rhetorical if not real. In a concession
speech delivered to a cheering
faithful. Duryea said that this
campaign has “lost a brittle but won
many fights“ most notable in
awakening of a pre—deiith penalty

llours earlier. assessing the
significance of early downstate
returns favoring Carey. Kilborn had
downplayed their importance.

"We expect Carey to carry the
city." he said. "The upstate is our
stre'ngllt . . . We can turn out two
million voters again like we did for
(Gerald) Ford in (the presidential
election) I976."

Yet the upstate Republican sup-
port never nititcriiililcd. At best.
Duryea ltiid garnered 43 percent of
the returns at llzllf) pm. It fell disap-
pointingly short of offsetting

ebotiglt.

As the night wore on. itnd defeat
loomed iiicvilable. the tone began to
change.

‘1 don't think it will Iiiive it great
moot." he aiiid. “If we win. it will
ﬁve a great positive effect. but a loss
won't have a consistent negative

effect."

Impending defeat brought its
partner-blame. Republican ex-
governor Nelson Rockefeller was
singled out for his failure to par-
ticipiite in or endorse the Duryea cf-
fort.

Kilborn chose to attack the Carey
campaign. “He has confused to
public on the issues.“ he said. but did
not elaborate.

Perhaps the most often cited ex-
pltination was thttt Carey. or more
pointedly. his oil magnate brother
David. had the wallet big enough to
insure that the governor would re-
main iii the cttpittil building.

I searching for reasons for the
Republican loss. the owrwhelming
opinion of political observers was
not that Ciirey had miraculously

polls due to his own abilities. Rather.
it was felt tluit Duryea htid lost

While Ed Koch Iumbered through

other reporters about the camp.
" I'liey threw the New York Post

Engelman noted onething missing
from this election night. 'l‘ve been

was deafening. After a brief wait a

Each was greeted warmly. The band

Midge Costanm and Cuomo. the
Governor spoke. He said things like
