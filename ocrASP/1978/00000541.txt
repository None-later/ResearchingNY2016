or many at SUNYA and across
the nation, Monday,
November 6 was a time for
celebrating and promoting
Black unity.
lllack Solidarity Day. which
traditionally precedes Election Day, is a
time when all people of African heritage
are encouraged to stay away from work
or school and instead. to attend
community activities which promote
solidarity.

Wendell Heddon

'l'wo people who had a hand in
organizing on-campus activities were
Ron Simmons. liditor-in-Chicf of the

 

 

at Albany State University Black Alliance

(ASUBA) publication. Unity. and Peter
(iiscombe. ol the l’an-(.‘aribbean
Association.

“Black solidarity is both a rational and
emotional thing." Simmons claimed.
“Black Solidarity Day is a time to
demonstrate love and caring for each
other.“

the purpose of the day‘s activities at
SlJNYA \vas educational, according to
(iiscombe. lllack Solidarity Day is a time
lor “cultural sharing." he added.

ASlJllA, l‘uer/a Latina, the Pan-
Caribbean Association (l’CA). and the
Alrican 8/. Afro-American Studies
department were among the groups who
sponsored the “big learning session,“ as
(iiscombe termed it.

Activities included a movie and

seminar on the current apartheid

.situation in South Africa and Rhodesia.

which was led by natives of these
countries. There were various speeches by
members of Albany‘s Black community
including one on the “Role of Minorities
at Universities." Fucrza Lalina‘s Latino
Dancers performed Hispanic dances and
ASUBA‘s Burundi Dance Troupe
performed African dances.

The most visible activitiy ofthe day was
the on-campus march behind the
“liberation colors." a red. black and green
ﬂage originally designed by Marcus
Garvey, Black nationalist leader of the
early |90()s. According to Simmons. the
flag is a symbol of black unity. “The red is
for the blood that was shed and black is
for the color of our skins," Simmons said.
the green represents hope for the future
and symbolile life.

The intent of staying away from work
and school on Black Solidarity Day is to
bring a “slowdown” in the country, thus
demonstrating the power of the Black
community. Simmons stated. Asked if
Whites might be alienated by this, he
replied. “They have been antagonizing us
tor centuries and not givinga damn. so we
aren‘t going to give a damn about whether
they‘re antagonized. They should be
thankful. it could be more antagonistic.”

Non-blacks are not excluded from
participating in the day‘s activities and
are even encouraged to attend. said
Simmons and Uiscombe. “They are more
than welcome. The doors are open,"
(iiseombc said. When asked why more

Whites were not in the audience, the two
suggested several possible reasons: They
“feel intimidated.“ “don't give a damn."
or “feel guilty."

Simmons and (iiscombc both say they
are not advocates of separatism, and they
blame the U.S. government for
segregation. According to the National
Advisory Committee on Civil Disorders.
Simmons said. “This country is more
segregated in terms of social living now
than in the ‘60s. We are not promoting it.

It is being promoted by the power
structure.“ He adds, “In this case we are
the good guys and they arcthc bad guys."

The U.S. is supporting segregation
outside the country also. Simmons
claimed. "’l'his country is one of the
biggest supporters of Rhodesia and
South Africa, l don‘t care what Jimmy
Carter says.“ Simmons said the United
States is one of the biggest investors in
South Africa. second only to Great
Britain.
