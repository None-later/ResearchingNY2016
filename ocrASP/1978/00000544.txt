Rice won the MVP disignation
following an awesome season at the
plate. He led the majors with 46
home runs and 139 runs batted in.
and had 406 total bases — the ﬁrst
AL hitter to reach that plateau since
Joe Di Maggie had 4I8tota| bases in

I937.

Rice also led the majors in hits
with 213 and in triples with 15. He
had a slugging percentage of .600
and batted .3l5. third in the
American League behind I977 MVP
Rod Carew of Minnesota. who hit
.333. and AI Oliver of Texas. who
had a .324 avorage.

It took that kind of statistical
dominance to beat Guidry. who led
the majors with a 25-3 record that in-
cludcd ninc shutouts anda L74 carn-
cd run average. Guidry‘s .893 win-
ning percentage was the highest for
any Eli-game winner in baseball
history.
