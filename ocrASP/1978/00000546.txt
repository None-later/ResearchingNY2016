Danes ’Fifth In'yLambervt;
f: Playoff Chances Clbudy

by David Osborn

A potentially buoying afternoon
for Albany State regarding an
NCAA bid was tainted Saturday
\\ lten discouraging results
materialized among their major
rivals even before the Dane 9-6 upset
of .thnea College had transpired.

The biggest disappointment came
in St. Lawrence‘s 4l-0 blanking of
hapless Rl’i. With the win. the
Saints have vaulted atop the weekly
Lambert Bowl rankings: symbolicof
eastern Division lll football
supremacy. lthaca. previously
number one. fell back a notch and
Albanyjumped from number nineto
fifth in the poll.

Carnegie-Mellon sits tied with the
Bombers for second and Widener
presently resides in fifth. Neither of
them are eligible for a playoff bid
from this region. though. and the
Saints and lthaca remain the ob-
vious Dane obstacles to a berth. The
Albany jump of four notches is still
shocking in its quickness.

Crucial Selections

in the distance of all the Lambert
moves. lies the crucial NCAA selec-
tions. A selection committee is even-
tually left with the painstaking task
of sorting out the teams. records and
variables and dividing eight in-
vitations around the country. Theirs
is the choice that can shatter dreams
or bred others anew and they ac-
quiesse on Nov. l2 or l3.

“Right now i can say with certain-
ty that there will be two bids from the
east.“ said William Stiles. Hobart‘s
athletic director and chairman ofthe
NCAA Selection Committee. “The
res1~of the country is simply too
strong for three teams to be invited
trom any region.“ '

That is a big' factor in analyzing
the situation. lfthe Bombers and St.
Lawrence are resting atop the pack
after next week's games have been
tabulated. the most natural thing for
the group to do is pick the fron-
trunners for bids. it may come down
to a necessary loss from lthaca or the
Saints for the Danes to return to the
title chase.

“Albany is in the situation of being
the best team in the east and in the
top four in the nation if they hadn‘t
lost to Buffalo.“ said Times-Union
sportswriter Bill Heller. one of seven
Lambert electors. “You're not going
to ﬁnd a better Division lll team in
the country with two losses than
them.“

This coming Saturday. Albany
travels to Plattsburgh. St. Lawrence
hosts 5-] Rochester and in a fine
matcbup. Towson St. travels to
South Hill Field for a date with
lthaca. Should the Danes win their
contest. they must then hope for a
loss among their opponents for the
bid. The Saints would be a heavy
favorite. so Albany is looking for
Towson help.

Since the Tigers lost to the Danes

at University Field 37-28 on Com- '

munity University day. they have"
taken four straight and allowed a
meager seven points. Towson boasts
an impressive 7-2 mark of its own
and even has an outside shot at a
berth. Western Maryland. 6-l-l. lost
to Gettysburgh last week and they
play a lighter schedule than the other
contenders.

Should Towson win. both they
and lthaca would stand at 8-2.and if
Albany beats Plattsburgh. the Danes
would be 7-2. St. Lawrence would be
virtually assured ofa spot with a 9-l

record; losing only to the Bombers
by a point. Presumably. Albany
could grab the second slot by virtue
of their victories over both lthaca
a'nd Towson. '

"Without help. l‘d say out chances
are still a long shot." said Dane head

coach Bob Ford. “There is no ques--

tion that the lthaca game was a great
victory. but the Buffalo game was
also an equally bad loss. Right now
id say Towson would have to beat
lthaca.“

There are other schools with just
one loss that would be neglected in
favor of .Albany for a bid. due to
varying degrees of schedule difﬁcul-
ty. “Somebody like Western
Maryland is in about the same posi-
tion we were in l974 when we were
undefeated.“ said Albany assistant
coach Jack Siedlecki.“Wcjustdidn‘t
play anybody so we couldn‘t get a
bid."

Last year. only one squad.
Albany. got a call from the east and
instead three schools from the
northern district were invited. Stiles.
however. has said that can't be the
case this time with solid teams in all
quadrants awaiting bids.
Minnesota-Morris. presently top-
ranked nationwide and undefeated.
is all but assured of the first selec-
tion.

The other probable entrant from
the north. St. Johns of Minn.. was a
shutout loser last Saturday. St.
Lawrence's shutout win eased them
closer to the chase and they seem to
be a guaranteed choice. in common
opponents. Albany and the Saints
have both beaten Norwich. while St.
iawrence lost to lthaca.

school. The rivalry is there inside me
all the time."

By pulling the cord out of lthaca's
running machine. which was without
the services of fleet tailback John
Nicolo. the Albany defense preyed
on Bencsko‘s weakness —— his pass-
ing ability. “We made him pass the
hall.“ lieimerle said. “He did not
have much poise when he threw."

End Jim Dignan. who along with
lid 'l'ranholm was successful in
preventinganylong runsto originate
from either corner. called the
defensc‘s showing superior. “lthaca
was big and strong.“ Dignan said,
"But we had the right game plan to
beat them. Every ﬁrst down situa-
tion we stopped them for a loss ora
short gain. After than. it was allcake

» we worked hard and deserved it."

offensively. the Danes Were "just
good enough" to win. according to

Ford. Aldrich masterfully directed
the wishbone offense.complctingsix
of Li passes for 89 yards and running
the option error-free.
Scoring Opportunity

A possible Dane scoring oppor-
tunity occurred when halfback
Daryl Haynor recovered a ﬁrst-
quartcr Bencsko fumble on lthaca's
39-yard line. Following six con-
secutivc runs. Herman‘s early second
period ﬁeld goal attempt from the 30
was off to the right.

Before the ﬁrst halfended. Albany
was driving again. Aldrich's 20-yard
pass to tightend Ed Sellers brought a
i'ourth-and-two situation. This time

Ford. who‘called four trick reverses
in the contest. gambled for the ﬁrst
down. The run by Jack Burger. a
determined cx-lthaca player who
was competing despite a broken
hand, fell short on a pitch from

. Aldrich for ﬁrst-down yardage.

“i thought we could pick up the
first down." Ford said. “You haveto
feel we can pick it up."

At tltc game‘s end. the consistent
Mirabella was the Danes' leading
rusher with 96 yards on l7 carries.
Electrifying halfback Levi Louis.
who tallied 203 yards last week. was
held in check to 56.

“One of my friends had a friend
who was playing for lthaca. and he
came and told me that they were
definitely keying on me." Louis said.
"So i knew it was going to be a rou-
gh day for me. But i knew someone
else would be open. so in that way it
beneﬁttcd the team." .

Back to the hero ~ Arango. in the
Albany locker room at University
(iym. an overjoyed Schicffelin arriv-
ed and asked if his soccer star had
left for home yet. Arango then
appeared and was surprised to see
Schieffelin. “Hey, coach!" he ex-
claimed. Schieffclin then kissed him
on the cheek like a proud father.

Schicffclin asked Dario if he knew
that a $l,000 grant was awarded to
Albany State in his name as ABC‘s
offensive player of the game.

"Do i get to keep $500?" Arango
qutpped.

The Academy Award winner
always gets the ﬁnal crack.

 

"Albany bent a u team
in lthaca and lthoughtthey playeda
great game.“ said Heller. a 1975
alumnus from here. “Steve. Nicolo.
ithaca‘s ﬁne tailback missed the
game and they may take that into
consideration."

Harriers Sparkle. In State Meet

by Jeff Carone ,

This past Saturday the Albany
State cross country team. in an out-
standing effort. placed second in the
NY State Track and Field Associa—
tion Meet. The Danes ﬁnished ahead
of lo teams and behind only
Fredonia. while placing three men in
the top 26.

Leading the way for Albany. in his
usual position. was Sean Reilly. He
continued his steady front-running
by placing ninth and being named to
the All-NY. State team. This
honor is added to the All-
Conference team he made at the
SUNYAC's two weeks ago.

After Reilly. came quite a surprise
in the form of senior Ed Von Bevern
placing 16th. Although he has been a
consistent runner for the barriers. his
jump to the number—two spot was
still unexpected. It was. however. in
character with this year's team in
which there are so many heroes.

Von Bevern's race was. in the
words of Albany State coach Bob
Munsey. “undoubtedly the best race
of his life.“ Following behind Von
Bevern was Jack Russo in 26th
place. \{on Bevern was named with
Reilly to the All-State team while
Russo just missed. as the top 25
ﬁnishers were named to the honor.
Mark Lavan and John Little round-
ed out the scorers for Albany.

Before WCI)B‘s broadcast of
Saturday‘s Albany-lthaca matchup.
David Osborn spoke with Terry

‘ iianratty. colorman for the ABC

telecast ofthe contest. Hanratty was
a standout quarterback at Notre
Dante and ﬁnished third in balloting
for the Heisman Trophy his senior
year. After a seven-year stint with
the Pittsburgh Steelers. he turned his
interests to television.

Here is a transcript of that inter-
view:

Q: Have you seen much small-
collegc football?

A: The area i grew up in Penn—
sylvania was a real bigarca; Slippery
Rock. Clarion St.. lndiana St. That
was probably the most football i
ever watched growing up. You could
almost classify the school that i
broadcast for now. Colorado St.. as
a smaller college. Even though the
enrollments are bigger than these
two tennis. they‘re still on the upsw-
ing.

Q: What goes intothe preparation
fora Division lll game on television.
especially because you‘re not so
familiar with the teams?

A: Well it‘s a lot of preparation for
us because llive in Coloradoand l‘m
not up on the east coast games too
tnuch. We meet with the coach. and
the Sll)‘s (Sports information
Directors). We see game ﬁlms and
get input from the coaches so we'll be
prepared to do the ballgame on
@turday.

 

ﬁnishing 32nd and 37th respectively.

Freshman Bruce Shapiro also ﬁnish- ,

ed high. in 43rd place and seems to
have shaken offan earlierleginjury.

The 10.000 meter race was longer
titan the usual ﬁve miles run by the
team. This added distance, however,
is of beneﬁt to the Great Danes
because of a lack of speed.

“Our problem is we have no great
specdster except possibly for Sean
(Reilly).“ said Munsey.

This lack of quickness has forced
the barrier‘s to be a come-from-
bchind team. Von Bevern and Russo
have been emblematic of this. often
falling back at the beginning and
then outlasting their opponents the
rest of the way.

This strategy was used inthe State
meet with a twist added to it.
Munsey asked Von Bevern and
Russo to go out a little faster than
normal.

This addedjump. plus their usual
catch-up. enabled the pair to ﬁnish
higher and propelled Albany into se-
cond place. it may have been the
difference between second and third
place. as Albany defeated Rochester
l l5 to [30.

The next stop for the harrier‘s is
the District ll NCAA Qualifying
Meet at Hamilton College. on Satur-
day. Nov. It. The top four ﬁnishing
teams will move on to the NCAA

Q: How do you feel about coming
in here; are you looking forward to
doing the game'.’

A: Yeah. I really am. it‘s different
from what l‘m used to doing. We‘ve
got two teams that run the ball all the
titne and i'm used to a passing game
when l was playing, and when l‘m
broadcasting out in Colorado. But
it's gonna be interesting because you
have two teams that are very similar
and you've got a lot of offense and i
think there's gonna have to be a lot
of defense to stop these offenses.

Q: How did you feel going into
your first trainittg camp; did you
think you were going to get the star-
ting quarterback job?

A: Yeah. i was hoping to. At that
time they still had the College All-
Star game. so anyone who played in
that game was delayed a couple of
weeks in getting to camp. it really
hurts a quarterback because a
quarterback has to be in camp and
learn the system. it was a slow start,
but towards the end of my rookie
season i was starting and we were
doing pretty well.

Q: And then Terry Bradshaw
came in. how was the competition
then?

A: Well. Terry came in my second
year; he was a rookie. At that time it
was sort of back-and-forth. He
would start a game and i would start
a game. At that time the Steelers
were not settled. we didn’t have the
good defense and the offense was

Division lll Championships.

The team would not be going to
the Qualifying meet if they had run
poorly at the New York State race.
Although there is no formal stan-
dards to enter the qualifying meet,
the Danes set their own.

Shortly before.the race. the team
agreed that they must ﬁnish third or
better to move on. This kind of goal
setting is characteristic ofthis squad
which may lack stellar talent. but
gets the most out ofwhatthey have.

At the qualifying meet. the squads
to beat are Plattsburgh and
Fredonia. Both teams have beaten
Albany. but are not completely out
of reach.

“Frcdonia isn‘t awesome. they
could be beaten.“ said Munsey. “all
other things being equal.“

The barriers have an added plus.
since their training all season has
been geared to the State Cham-
pionships and the upcoming
qualﬁcr. Last year‘s team had a
superb season. but peaked too early
at the SUNYAC's and did little the
rest of the way.

Although the team. as Munsey put
it “shocked everybody" at the State
meet. he feels there is some improve-
ment possible. He points out that
Lavan attd Little have run better
than they did at the State meet.
Munsey also feels that Russo. Von

Terry Hanratty: He Enjoys 17w

lacking also. it was difﬁcult for both
of us because there wasn‘t a veteran
around we could lean on. and we sort
of had to take the ball and go
ourselves.

Q: When you continued your
career at Pittsburgh. eventually
'l‘crry emerged as the starting
quarterback. How did that come
about?

A: Well. it was just a couple of
years back-and-forth fighting each

 

sta . w

and Terry was the quarterback then.
A lot goes into it. you'vejust got to
be patient in that league. l retired
after eight years and probably didn’t
reach all the goals i set. but with a
battered body I think it was time to
get out.

Q: So how would you summarize
your pro football career in a few
words?

A: Well. i think it was very en—
joyable; a lot of memories to look
back on. llut life is in many phases,
high school being one, college
another. and the pros another. Now

l‘m branching out into other things.
so at this point in my life. i think it
was a good time to retire.

Q: Was there arty one decision that
made you feel that you had enough
with professional football and you
wanted to get into broadcasting?

A: Well. yeah. I think through my
career i had a broken ankle. a knee
operation. separated shoulder. a
broken coilarbone. broken ribs.
many broken fingers. l'm 30-years-
old and l have the body ofa 40-year-

 
 

 
   
   

old. so i think it was time to retire.

Q: Was broadcasting your first
choice of what you wanted to get in-
to'.’ Had you thought about that
belore you retired from football?

A: Yeah. i really did. i built up a
good background in broadcasting. i
did a lot ofsports work in Pittsburgh
on the air and i think that did a lot
for me. i think knowledge of the
game means a great deal. and i
always considered myselfa good stu-
dent of the game.

Q: How much does it really helpto
have played the game and then come
and do the color commentary? Does

l‘m ecstatic over second."

Fine Showing
So they head to the qualifiers with
the ﬁne State showingtueked neatly
in their hip pocket. They go to the
NCAA‘s or stay home. simply on
whether they ﬁnish in the top four in
the upcoming meet. There is no
selection committee. no ifs. no look-
ing for help. They are ontheirown.

The Booth1

it really give youtbat added insight?

A: Oh it really does; especially if
you're a student oftlte game. There‘s
a lot of things you can pick up
quicker than somebody who has
never played the game would pick
up. It might take them 10 years to
pick some keys. But i feel that
through my knowledge ofthe game i
can really addalot tothe broadcast.

Q: Are you a little nervous or
jittery about working your ﬁrst game
for ABC!

A: No. ltakethe same attitude asl
did when l was playing. lnever really
got excited or nervous before a
game. i felt that as a quarterback you
really couldn't get nervous because
you had to be the general out there
and direct people. ifhinkthere istoo
much going on in my mind to actual-
ly have the outside surroundings
make me nervous.

Q: As a prediction. what do you
think about the outcome for today's
game after looking over the scouting
reports and talking to the Sports in-
formation Directors and coaches?

A: I think it‘a reallya tough one to
predict because there‘s so much run-
ning involved. if there was a lot of
passing involved. then you could
predict turnovers. and you‘d look at
the defensive backs and their reac-
tions. But tonight lthink botbteams
are like mirroringeach other because
they both look alike on ﬁlm. lt'sjust
gonna come down to the point of
who executes best. J
