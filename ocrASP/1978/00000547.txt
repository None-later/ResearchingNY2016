Arango Kick Stuns. Ithaca

by Rich Sellgson

He stood on the Bleecker Stadium

an Academy Award. Smiling broad-

gratulations. his eyes were not glar-

Dario Ariingo's kick travelled 45

him boot several booming field

deadlocked the score at six. the
Duties had 4:24 left to avoid an un-
desirable tie. In a play that was
characteristic of the game's unusual
ending. Ithaca kicker Tom Darling‘s
extra point sailed to the left. Darling
had previously hit on 53 of 55
conversions.

"We weren't gonna let it end in a
tie." said Albany offensive tackle
Rich Auficro. "Wcjust came out and
dominated. In our heads. it was still
0-0."

Scott Lusher‘s diving catch of
Brad Aldrich‘s perfectly-placed ball
advanced the Danes 37 yards to
lthaca‘s 20-yard line. lwo plays

Arango wasthcnsummonedto
the field by Ford. "We were going to
kick Berman. but alter the loss. we
were out of Gary's range." Ford ex-
plained. His switch from the regular
lield goal kicker to Arango resulted
in the soccer goalie emerging as the
eventual hero.

Arango proceeded to drill the kick
through the uprights. with five yards
to spare. Sorter-style, "mural/y.

coach Vince Carncvalc. stunned
more than anyone by the exciting

A cool and conlident Arango was
the least surprised of all. “I wanted to

ing right down the middle. I‘m glad I
got my chance."

llie chance to play Ithaca was
what the entire Albany squad had
been waiting for since Day I of the
‘78 campaign. “ We beat the team we
wanted to beat." said stalwart defen-
siie halfback Rich lleimerle. who
skillfully deflected quarterback
Doug Itcucsko's pass away from

lerry Jarvic on Ithaca‘s last play
with 0:45 left in the game.

"All you can say is how sweet it is.“
commented Larry Pearson. a starter
at the defensive tackle position in—
stead ol' regular Steve Smith. “We
knew we could play with these guys.
It shouldn't have been that close.“

Albany‘s defense allowed 31 points

Bid Secure; Boaters Miss Crown

by David Osborn

Assured of their third NCAA
playoff hid. the Albany State soccer
team attempted to build momentum
for the tournament and secure their
first SUNYAC title ever yesterday,
but were denied in a brutal l-lllossat
llrockport.

llie Danes looked to escape the
contest with no injuries and insure a
healthy lineup for the opening
round matchup with Cortland
Saturday. Again. though. the
(iolden Eagles had other notions.
l’cpc Aguilar. an Albany starting
rnidlicldcr. was smacked in the head
and received a firm knee in his right

liliink they wanted to hiltiw they

were the team that should have gone
to the playoffs and they wanted to
prove that on the field." said Dane

coach llill Schicllclin. "They were ‘

out for some sort of vendetta."

(iavin 'l’imoiiey tallied the con-
iest‘s only goal when he cleanly beat
Albany goalie Dario Arango at
l7:Jll ol the first half. Taking a high
toss in front of the cage. he leaped
a hove the conclavc guarding the net
and sent the ball straight for the right
corner with a flick of his head.
Arango's dive was futile.

Way back on Oct. 7. the same
squads had met on the identicall'tcld

have been trying to prove that the
result was not indicative of the dis-
parity. and the numerous bruises
aside from Aguilar‘s mishaps
attested to the vicious pacc.

A phone call fromthc chairman of
the select-ion committee to
Schicflclin Monday afternoon
clinched the berth alter Albany had
been passed over in the original in-
vrtations Sunday. Kean College of
New Jersey took an early bid. but
was forced to forfeit the honor when
it was discovered that one of their

showing against Ithaca. Sticking to
defensive coordinator Jack
Sicdlecki‘s strategy like lly paper, the
Danes held the Bombers to 10 ﬁrst
downs and 224 total yards. Take
away Ferrigno‘s long touchdown,
and thc rcputable Bomber running
attack (over 300 yards per game
average) would havc gained a yard
over the century mark.

“Jack Sicdlecki was ready for this
game." said Auficro. " Every night he
probably didn‘t sleep a wink. He did
a helluva job. Our defense shined.
that's all there is to it."

"In practice we stressed forcing
the quarterback to pitch the ball."
Siedlccki said. “Our kids did exactly
the things thcy Iiad to do. Ourfront
eight was just incredible against the
rail. [his was the best rushing team
we faced."

Late in the first quarter. Bencsko
attempted his first pass. Free safety
Cal Hint intercepted the ball in front
of split end Jim Meyer. and scooted
down the sidelines until he was

brought down at the Ithaca four-
yard line.

Fullback Mike Mirabella. who
had praisc for the Albany offensive
line. especially center John D‘Anna.
then bullcd his way over the goal line
for the Danes‘ sole touchdown. Ber-
inan's extra point was off-range. and
the 6-0 score stood until the fourth
quarter. A defensive encounter in the
fullest sense.

“The hitting was at a fierce level."
Ford said. “This was a very physical
football game."

Of Bencsko‘s live completed
acrials. three of them were snagged
by the ball-hawking Flint. who
without question had his best perfor-
mance of the season. “I was so ex-
cited and ready.“ Flint said. “I
figured I was going to have a good
game. but [didn't know how good. It
turned out to be a pretty good game.

A former SUNYA
department chair. who was

assailed in a 1975 presidential
ad-hoc committee report as
having the “tempermental and
administrative incapacity" to
chair his department, is being
solicited for the position of
German department chair.

In addition. the same man,
according to a report by a
hearing examiner of the State
Division of Human Rights to
the commissioner of that
agency, “humiliated.
threatened. verbally abused,
and physically manhandled" a
member of his department.

Judith Leibowitz. .

Joseph Szovcrffy. former
chair of the rctrenched

department. has been sought
after and “corresponded with"

department John Spalek.

President Steve Allinger.

various SUNY university
presidents are dissatisfied with
the current level of funding of
intercollegiate athletics and co-
activitics such as

“made Szovcrffy aware of the,
German chair vacancy."

However. O’Leary denied
actively seeking Szovcrffy for
the position. saying only that
the former department head has
“corresponded with SUNYA as
to openings. and I have kept
him informed."

Szovcrffy has filed suit
against SUNY. SUNYA,
Spakek and others. for what he
considers to have been. in his
case. an unwarranted
retrenchment. Spalck was chair
of the Task Force on Priorities

and Resources. which
recommended to former
SUNYA President Emmett
Fields the eventual

retrenchment decisions.

It was Szovcrffy's handling
of the 1975 tenure case of
Leibowitz which prompted then
SUNYA President Louis
Benezet to establish the special
ad-hoc investigative committee.
The committee recommended
that Szovcrffy be removed from
his chairmanship.

That recommendation came
as the result of the committee's
findings of serious procedural
and other irregularities in
Szovcrffy's handling of the

Leibowitz tenure case.
Meeting in response to

charges by Leibowitz that
Szovcrffy mishandled her
tenure case and engaged in
abusive behavior and
unprofessional conduct. the

committee was to be only one
among numerous academic and
legal forums surrounding her
case.

At present. three court
actions concerning the
Leibowitz tenure proceedings
are awaiting action. Two of
these cases involve her claim of
being “arbitrarily and
capriciously” dismissed from
her job. The other is an action
before the State Human Rights
Division over Iier claim that she
was discriminated against by
Szovcrffy because of her sex.

Human Rights Division
Hearing Examiner Norman
Mednick. on July l2. 1978, ‘

concluded in his report to the
commission that Szovcrffy:

- Was antagonistic towards
female faculty members. that he
harrassed. .. threatened and
exhibited explosive behavior
toward them. other female
employees and female students.

- Stated in conversations

should “submit to harrassment or suffer the consequences."
according to Hearing Examiner Norman Mednlck. (Photo: UPS)

with her and others the
complainant [Leibowitz] is
“evil.” "dangerous," and a
"threat."

.Told complainant that she
should submit to such
harrassmcnt or suffer the
consequences.

On the basis of the foregoing,
Mednick concluded that

Szovcrffy and ultimately SUNY
violated the Human Rights law.

Urged To Disapprove Tax Hike

music, drama. and other
programs in the performing
arts. and want Wharton to veto
any raise in the activity fce’s
ceiling unless an increase in the
allocation of revenue collected
from the fee toward these
programs is guaranteed.

ln I968. 21 maximum limit of
$35 per semester was placed on
the fee. which funds nearly all
student activites on SUNY
campuses. by the SUNY
Chancellor and Board of
Trustees. Students on the
individual campuses. voted to

   

 

increase their fee by specific
dollar amounts at intervals
throughout the l0-year period.
This year. according to
Allingcr. marks the point at
which every SUNY campus has
reached the $70 annual
maximum. SUNYA reached the
limit last year when SUNYA
students approved a referendum
to raise the fee.

“SA expanded services since
I968. when the ceiling was
made.", said SA President Paul
Fcldman. “The $70 limit is not
realistic. It’s a 1968 limit that
was realistic then and isn’t
realistic today. All the lifting of
the mandatory ceiling does is
give us flexibility. It just gives
the ability. if Albany decides to
go higher. to go higher. It’s up
to the students to decide the
level of taxes they should pay."

NYPIRG lixccutivc
Committee (‘hair Torn Novick
has cited U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics figures showing the
buying power of a dollar in 1978
as equivalent to the buying
power of SI cents in I968.

That"s roughly half the
buying power we had in I968,"
said Novick. “Student groups
are forced to fight each other
and spend a major part of their
time just making sure that
they’ll exist next year on
campus. it’s just cannibalism."

An increase in the activity fee
ceiling was first suggested to
Wharton last June at a Potsdam
conference with the SUNY

Student Assembly. The
Assembly a SASU-run student
governance arm of SUNY,
proposed a $30 increase in the
ceiling’s level. giving student
governments the option of
raising the fee to as much as
$l00 per year.

According to Allinger.
Wharton agreed to the proposal
and voiced his intentions to
approve it once it was presented
to him. Although the
proposition was drafted and
sent to Wharton's office. no
word was received on the issue
until last week. said Allinger

Allingcr brought the issue
before Wharton again last
Thursday at a state-mandated
open hearing of the SUNY
Board of Trustees held at
Gcncsscc Community College.
After five months, Wharton
said that he was still considering
the proposal, but would make a
decision “in time for student
governments to adjust their
budgets accordingly. "

Neiilier Allinger nor Novick
fully understood the meaning of
Wharton's statement. as
student governments can make
decisions at any time. and
rcl‘crenda cart be put to students
for a vote at any time. Both

agree that Wharton was
deliberately vague in a
successful attempt to avoid

binding himself to a deadline.
Wharton has not been
available for comment for the
condoned on page ﬁve

and recommended among other

things" that SUNY pay
compensatory damages v to
Leibowitz.

While Mednick did ﬁnd that
Leibowitz had been subjected to
sexual harassment. he did not.
however. term the evidence
sufficient to conclude that she
was denied tenure beenusr: of
her sex. The case is now
awaiting ruling and action by
the Human Rights Commission.

Because of the pending court
actions. Leibowitz refused to
comment on the possibility of
Szovcrffy returning to SUNYA

Szovcrffy’s handling of the
Leibowitz tenure case has also
been cited as a contributing

factor in the eventual
retrenchment of his
department. In an ASP

interview on December 2, I977.

another former Comparative
Literature chair. H. Berkley
Peabody. asserted that the
retrenchment was an
administration attempt to
“sweep... an embarassing

mess under the rug.”

“The immediate cause [of the
retrenchment] was the
Leibowitz tenure case.” he said.

When pressed. O'Leary
refused to evaluate Szovcrffy's
relative qualifications for a
department head position.

“My position is that I want to

see any rctrenclicd faculty
member back if he is
qualified," said O’ Leary.

“However it is the job of the
faculty committee to make the
final decision. weighing the
issues as they see fit. not as I
do."

O’l.eary explained that. if the
faculty committee chose to
reccoinmcnd Szovcrffy for the
position. lie would then be
compelled to evaluate. but that
he did not want to “pre-empt
faculty decisions.”

He went on to claim that his
correspondancc with Szovcrffy
concerning the opening is

'neithcr extraordinary. nor does
'g it constitute an endorsement.
