Chancellor Urged Not to Support Tax Ceiling Hike

continued/ram page one
\ past three days.

“This deﬁnitely has
something to do with the fact
that the [SUNY] Council of
College Presidents has come out
against the hike," said Novick.
“They’re not the group he
[Wharton] particularly wants to
alienate. He has to deal with
them. I guess he's looking into
the issue and trying to come up
with something that's going to
make everyone happy. With the
current proposals I'm hearing
about, that doesn’t seem to be

incorporate the various means
by which the Council plans to
assure that a specified amount
of funds are allocated annually
to intercollegiate sports and co-
curricular activities.

(The Council's ﬁrst strategy,
according to Novick, consists of
the pressure presently being
exerted on Wharton ‘not to
approve the student activity fee
ceiling hike. The Council’s
second course of action require
skillful circumvention of the
right of student governments to
budget and allocate the fee

at all likely.” throughout their individual

guidelines adopted by the Board
of Trustees in Septembedr of
1976.

“Proceeds of the student
activity fee shall be disbursed by
the representative student
organization, through the
designated custodial and
disbursing agent." read the
guidelines. If an amendment
was approved by the Board to
alter this one sentence. the use
of funds collected through the
activity fee could be wholly or
partially placed in the hands of
the trustees. In fact, such a goal
could be achieved by simply
substituting the words "Board
of Trustees" for
“representative student
organization.”

According to Allinger. the
Council will either amend their
guidelines or institute an
entirely new fee, to be used
solely as funding for
interscholastic athletics and co-

curricular activities. Such a fee
would be mandatory,‘ would
probably not be subject to
waivers of‘_ any kind, and
would not be covered by TAP
said Allinger. '

According to Novick. the
Council made plans at a
meeting last summer to
appropriate 17 percent of the
revenue generated by the
activity fee for intercollegiate
athletics use and another 14
percent for use by co-curricular
activities.

According‘ to SUNYA
President Vincent O’Leary. the
main problem with funding
intercollegiate athletics use and
another 14 percent for use by
co-curricular activities

According to SUNYA
President Vincent O'Leary,_the
main problem with funding
intercollegiate athletics is a lack
of stability, affecting the teams'
long-range plans.

“The point is. if you schedule
a game for four years from
now, will the budget be the
same, or will it be changing

from year to year. so when the
‘time comes. wecan’t make the

 

trip?" asked O'Leary. “It’s a
problem. How do you make a
commitment beyond the period
fortime of one year? I'm not
saying lack of trust or anything
else, but how does a student
association take' long-term
ventures?"

“Some [SUNY] presidents
were more concerned —with
control and others were more
concerned with stability." said
O’Lcary. “Some presidents
don’t want any change at all.
But call it a tuition increase or a
mandatory fee. 10 dollars is still
10 dollars that the sudents have
to pay. I don't have any pet
solution about how it can be
done)‘

Feldman sees three possible
methods of funding SUNIY’s
intercollegiate _ sports: \by
forcing student governments to

. fund athletics at a particular

level, by instituting a
mandatory, student—controlled
athletics fee, or by funding
from the State of New York.

I don't think it’s an
appropriate role for student
associations to be required to
