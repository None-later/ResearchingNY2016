SIT DOWNI

Can a woman be sued for damages
for breaking a date?

A small claims court in San Fran-
cisco has been asked to decide that
issue afteran accountant namchom
I-Iorsley ﬁled suit to reclaim 538 he
says he lost when he was stood up.

Horsley alleges that he‘made a
date 10 days in advance with AIyn
Chesselct of San Francisco. but that
when he arrived to pick her up. she
said she was forced to cancel the
engagement because of a change in
her work schedule.

Horsley says he wants the 538 to
cover the time and mileage he ex-
pended driving to and from his
broken date. According to the ac-
countant‘s attorney, Horsley is “not
the type of man to take standing up
lying down."

VICIOUS SID

Former Sex Pistols member Sid
Vicious, who is currently being held
on murder charges in New York in
connection with his girl friend‘s stab-
bing. has boasted about being
violent in the past.

As a matter of fact. in an issue of
Rolling Stone which was printed up
before the New York stabbing.
Vicious boasts about killing a cat.

In a recent single titled “My Way,
Vicious sings about killing a cat.
When asked about the lyrics, he told
Rolling Stone that he did. in fact. kill

 

 

the pet because it went- to the
bathroom on his shoes. Said Sid
Vicious: “I hung it."

FOOD & VIOLENCE

A leading nutritionist is blaming
much of the violence that occurred
among fans during the world series
games in the stands on stadium food.

Nutritionist H.L. Newbold
reports that hot dogs, hot dog and
'hamburger buns, beer and soft
drinks all contain certain additives
that can make individuals violence-
prone.

According to Newbold. stadiums
should serve items like fruit juices,
hamburgers without buns and

vironment . . . a region air‘s disease.

The EPA notes there is a growing
body of evidence indicating that
wastes and other chemicals poured
into our surroundings are causing
massive increases in illnesses.

The study says that in I900. death
from cancer, heart and lung disease
accounted for just I2 percent of the
deaths in the US. Today. that figure
has escalated to 59 percent.

UNLIABLE LABEL

Canned fruits and vegetables sold
under "generic" rather than brand
label names are reportedly selling so
well that supplies of these lower
quality food are running out in ma-

vitamin pills. Newbold is quick to jar rsupcrmarkcls‘

admit. however, that his proposal
probably won't be embraced by
"most" stadium concessionaires.

AIR DISEASE

The Environmental Protection
Agency is out with a new report that
attempts to identify the number one
cause of death in modern America.

The surprise in the findings is that
the number one culprit is not a major
disease, nor malnutrition nor even
accidents. Instead. according to the
EPA. today's biggest killer is the en-

   
 

“Generic” foods are usually stan-
dard or extra~standard grade fruits
and vegetables which supermarkets
consider edible. but not high quality
food. Supermarket chains have
begun offering the “generic” foods in
cans without grand names for prices
which range from I0 to 33 percent
below the average price of advertised
brands. '

'I'raditionalIy-standard grades
were bought for house brands. and
cannch often had to lower prices to
clear inventories of these products.

_ braca‘dabra, '
ISIt on his knee. '

Presto chango,

and now he is me.

'Hocus pocus,

we take her to bed.

Magic is fun;
. we’re dead.

, Today, however, food canners
complain they've got more requests
for standard grades than they can'
handle. and there simply aren't any
supplies left to buy.

Some stores are reportedly
responding to the shortages of stan-
dard fruits and vegetables by
packaging the higher quality fancy
items under generic names.

COKE STUDY

A four-year, $4 million govem-
ment study has found that there is lit-
tle evidence to suggest cocaine is a
dangerous drug when administered
in moderate doses.

The Pharmchem Research Foun-
dation reports that the government
coke study was prepared by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) and released last year.

In that study. a moderate dose of
cocaine was described as being about
one-fortieth of a gram given in-
travsnously. or one-tenth of a gram
taken intranasally. ‘

The NIDA researchers said that
moderate use of cocaine seems to
temporarily elevate pulse rate and
blood pressure. and warned that
chronic sniffing of the drug can
cause’ inﬂammation of the nasal
passages.

 

.. ; NlDA warned. ,howeverathstln
rare instances massive doses of
cocaine may cause death. The study

also concluded that while cocaine is e

not addictive. extensive coke usecan
cause what it calls “psychological
dependence.”

PET-TICOAT PLUS
