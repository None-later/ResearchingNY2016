“Anycarlseeonadimlylighted
street, with the door unlocked or a win-
dow ajar, belongs to me if I want it."
Thespeakerisacarthiel‘withmorethan
25 years experience. “lt's stupid to risk
getting caught stuling a locked car in a
well-lighted area. l know that within a
block of it I could find another one just
as good that I can steal under ideal
conditions."

Another veteran thief says, “You
would be amazed how easy people will
make it for you. l’ve stolen — been
given is a better term — cars that had the
keys in the switch and even some with
titles and gasoline credit cards in the
glove compartment."

These two men. who know the car
theft business well. point up some of the
things you do that are almost certain to
make a gift of your car to someone who
wants it.

Locking a car doesn't guarantee
against theft. lf the thief really wants
your car. he'll get it —- forcing or
smashing a window. slitting the top or
Whatever is necessary. He'll then close
the ignition switch with jump wires
hooked up either to the dash or under
the hood.

By locking your car and taking the
keys you’ll deter him or at least make
him uncomfortable at his work. Parking
it on a well-lighted. busy street or in a
well-illuminated, bustling part of the
supermarket parking lot will discourage
him from thievery.

Since thieves generally do not know

 

who owns the car they are trying to steal,

the presence of any warnings are usually
sufficient to prevent the theft. Public
parking lots are great favorites among
the pros and the joy riding thieves
because in many of them you must
leave the keys in your car.

If you must park in a lot where you
are required to leave your keys, leave the

   

r

theft rings uncovered that work in
league with parking lot attendants. if
you leave your trunk key, you're in
danger of losing everying in your trunk,
including your spare tire and wheel.

If your house and ofﬁce key were left
with the ignition key, it's a simple
process to get the duplicates made. They
can learn where you live through your li.
cense plates and they have easy entrance,
all arranged sometime in the future.

Another piece of good advice is keep-
ing everything of value that you can in
your trunk. The “booster” usually will
steal only what he can see. If your
valuables are out of sight, he may pass
you by. A popular item among car
thieves is your license plate. Check them
daily. License plates are frequently
stolen from parked cars and used on
stolen cars for other crimes. You'd prob
ably notice if your plates were missing,
so thieves will replace your plates with
other stolen plates. knowing the
average driver probably isnt going to
check. Such a routine check for the car
owner can not only prevent his arrest for
using false plates. but can prevent
embarrassment and inconvenience if
your own plates are connected to the
crime elsewhere.

A relatively small percentage of the
cars stolen each year are taken by the
real “pros.” Most are the “joy riders."
the oneotimers or the amateurs. The
precautions outlined here will protect
you from most of them.

This letter is in replyto Walt Plock slettcr in

last Tuesday‘s ASP. It is true that the food
UAS supplies is served in unlimited quantity
and is edible. but lquestionjust howtasteful it
is. Many of the selections of food that UAS
serves are pretty poor.

l realize it is wrong to criticize a system
without giving alternative ideas. I have two
choices that hopefully UAS could apply.

hrst. the UAS should publish a list of all
mcdls sened. which would be used as a survey.
[he students could check which foods
sludcnls like and dislike. lhen they could
hand these surveys in in tables central council
or [he quad boards set up. Then hopefully
l -\5 could remme some of the least liked
meals.

\l;. second ulternaiiic is something] believe
tcntral tounctl is working on. If you don‘t
ﬁtt- the dlnl’lt'f. you could go the the
Rdlhshcllul. and get a substitute merit. (ex. 3

iltlL‘Jd} been adopted. qutte CllcCllVCl)’ at

‘ To The Editor:

On Friday. Oct. 27th, I and nine other
lucky individuals had our cars towed

i away from Colonial Quad parking lot.

SUNYA security felt it was their

' obligation to call in a towing service,

t which charged an enormous amount of

money, because their own truck was
being painted. 1 had parked in the same
spot for four weeks and l was given no
ticket or warning ahead of towing.

I can see no valid reason for the
towing except maybe as another money
making scheme for the university.
Becaue some arbitrary fund is running
low they have to take it out on the
students.

I realize that this practice will most

. \
likely continue and that I as an

individual can't do anything about it but
I think the students of SUNYA should
be aware of what is happening.

To The Falltor:
Many people raised questions

concerning the Class of 1981's non.
involvment in the recent three class
Halloween party. held in the Campus
Center ballroon two weekends ago. I
hope this letter will sufﬁciently address
their concerns.

The Class ofﬁcers and council decided
not to participate in the party since:

I. The purpose of the Class of 1981 is
to act in the best interest of its members;

2. There was no admission dittcrcniial
granted to any class; and

3. The approximate cost of
participating in this function would be
close to five hundred dollars.

These reasons quite Clearly silt)“ lhal
there was no benefit to the Class
members. and it would ll‘tlH.‘ cost the
class a considerable amount oi money
