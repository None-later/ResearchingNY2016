In my younger days, all a bar needed to
make me happy was beer, loud music.
and a wide assortment of attractive
members of the opposite sex. Well, that's
about all the Frat House II has. and it sure
didn't make me happy.

it's out on Fuller Road, not exactly your
average neighborhood for bars. We
should have known by the parking lot that
the place was a loser. Not because it was
devoid of cars mind you, but because it
was full of pits. l've never seen a parking
lot do a better imitation of the moon in my
life.

M.J. W

The next warning signal that we chose
to ignore was the greeting party at the
door. The guy collecting the cover charge
($1 for ladies, $2 for men) looked like a
cross between Charlie Rich and Jackie
Gleason. He was dressed in pseudo-hip
style, black pants and vest. ruffled shirt,
and a wide-brimmed black cowboy hat.
The kitid of guy who's old enough to be
your father, but naturally assumes that
every young college woman loves him
becansc he owns a bar and he‘s "cool."

Like the fools we are, we paid up and
went in. To put it bluntly, the inside is
tacky. it's got a nice round bar, but that's
the high poittt. There's a lot of tables,
spaced around the outside of a fairly
large, very unused (lance floor. And of
course. it's dark so one doesn't really have
to noticcjust how avoragc the decorations
are.

The clicntcle is interesting. Sure,
there's a lot of good-looking members of
both sexes. But the impression i got when
l walked around to check out wlto was
there was that at 11 o'clock about 50 cars
of Albany parents were going to pull up to
claim their young offspring and get them
home to bed. “Jail-bait" would be an
appropriate phrase to apply in this case.

Tbch were a few patrons old enough to
liilVU‘liiCii‘ night licenses, however. They
seemed to he carbon copies of the guy at
the door. Average weight about 260,
height about 0‘4". 1.0. about 75. They're
the kind of guys who‘ll steal your beer
when you‘re not looking.

d, had plenty of beer and coinpuiitoiislitl'
alltlcs. (I’hoto: Karl Chan)

 

Which did indeed happen to me. We
had ordered 4 Millers at $1 a shot. The
bartender brought them to us, and 1
turned to hand one to a friend. Next thing
i knew, thejust-served full beer that had
been waiting for me was gone. in its place
was one about a third full.

Being the inquisitive guy I am. it sort of
intrigued me as to the where-abouts of my
beer. It didn't take long to figure out
where it went, especially when I noticed
the guy next to me nursing a nice full
bottle. He looked a bit nervous, and
moved on after we stared at him fora few
minutes. Nice guy; i hope he contracts a
terminal case of crabs.

The highlight of the evening was still to
come. The lights dimmed, a recorded
tape of very strange, non-rlcscript numc
came on, and then the band appeared. I
won't mention their name because forullf
know they could be nice guys and I
wouldn't want to embarrass them.

They weren't that bad actually. lint
their choice of music left a little bit to be
desired. It was like being littL‘k at the high
school dance. as they went through the
tuttcs of such renowned stars as Ted
Nugcnt. When they were done. it was like
a great heavy-metal weight had lit'tfll lifted
off my shoulders. '

We took this blessed relief as a sign that
we could now take off for better stomping
grounds. After a slight struggle to get to
the entrance because of all the \.tl\ll\'
jacketed hulks in our way, we nnnlt- it.
Sure enough, Mr. Cool iii the lilttcln ilttl
was still there raking in the big bucks.

The trek across the parking lot \hts
ouccagain full ofits tips and downs ilt'ftil'L'
we reached the pretty little bug lllltl stood
out like some sort of guiding light in the
darkness of our disappointment.

The Frat House ll, a plncc where I
might have been very happy going to in
high school, might have even thought it
was a great bar. But now it seems more
like a bail joke. a stereotype of most
everything that ‘an be wrong with an
establishment aimed only at gi'tllltg
people drunk.

Eggplant. a member of the squash
family, has proved to be an enjoyable and
economic dish in our household. With
food prices skyrocketing, it is encour-
aging to find a good source of nutrition in
a reasonably priced food. Not only is
eggplant economical. it is easy to cook,
arid always a tasty dislt.

Eve Kofsky
Beverly Reingold

Although eggplant can be purchased in
almost any supermarket. the best and
uiost reasonably priced eggplants we have
come across this semester, were at thc
Barbershop Co-op, located in the Campus
Center.

When you look for an eggplant, keep
these important points iii mind:

1. it should be of deep purple huc.

2. The skin should be smooth in texture
aitd unbrokcti.

3. A moderate size is usually best. it
should be between 8-l0 inches in length
and about 4 inches in diameter at its
widest point.

4. Don't be too concerned about the
shape - as far as eggplants go, tlterc is
little 'ariation.

The simplest and most basic eggplant
dish is fried eggplant. This is best served

The fried eggplant is also used as the
foundation for eggplant parmcgian. The

always a favority with company.
