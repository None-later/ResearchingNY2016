David Bowle

Bowie's newest album entitled simply
Stage. is a collection of songs performed
during his tour of the States last summer.
It contains a mixture of older material.
particularlyZiggy Stardust, and Station to
Station. and his new more musicaly
interesting Low and "Heroes". It is a
combination crowd pleaser and a good
collectioti of more serious and recent
efforts performed live. This albtim may be
significant in that Bowie sees his electron-
ic material gaining greater popular ap-
peat.

Gary Douglas

The album is divided into two records.
Record one is a collection of older ‘tunes'
primarily from Ziggy Stardust and Sta-
tion to station. None of these were done 01)
Bowic's previous live album. The Phila-
delphia soul is gone. no doubt Bowie
becatne bored with that image even before
he got it on the road. The songs are done

 

 

    

with simplicity and straight forward rock
and roll. Thus they are within the contest
of the original versions. but still Bowie
chooses not to sing them in the character
of Ziggy Stardust. He is more English
music hall a In Anthony Newly; he is more
David Bowie the man. Bowie sings these
songs as old favorites much the same way
Sinatra may feel compelled to sing “My
Way" as a crowd pleaser. But the songs
are worth listening to anyway and Bowie's
voice is one of the best in rock and roll.
Record two is far more interesting.
Here. sides one and two are compilations
of live records of material from Low and
"Heroes" exclusively. Bowie chose
mostly instrumentals; the electronic sides
of Low and "Heroes". This might be the
most controversial thing that Bowie has
ever done in live performance. Sure he
played the crowd pleasers. but to devote
so much time to his genuinely avant gardc
compositions was definitely a bit risky.
On the album Stage Bowie reproduces
the most precise renditions of his electron-
ic/avant-garde works. On "Warszawa,"
Bowie effectively emoted the long sus-
tained low notes and repetition of themes
that tend to free the listener of conven-
tional tonal restrictions and predictability
of direction. llowic is Inorc harmonically

free to modulate andjuxtaposc barinonics
and progressions that would otherwise
seem incongruous. Bowie's performance
of "Art Decade." “Sense of Doubt,” and
"Speed of Life" are effectively performed

in this regard.
Even the more conventional songs on
Bowie's previous two albums are really

“Never Say Die"
Black Sabbath

Black Sabbath has been

virtually
absent from the area of heavy metal. the
third world of music. since the release of
their last album. 'Iili'liiii'irtil Ecstasy. two
years ago. They have now returned with
NeverS'ayl)ie. their latest contribution to

degradation. demouology,
around mayhem.

AI Baca

Black Sabbath fornch in the late sixties
as an outgrowth of that decade's acid rock
syndrome. Since the release of their first
album, [Huck Sabbath, in 1970. the band
has maintained a continuous interest in
such topics as death, fantasy, demons.
and tlIc seamicr aspects of life. They grew
up in the company of such other heavy
metal deities as Led Zeppelin, Deep
Purple. Mountain. and Grand Funk
Railroad. and have consistently played to
capacity crowds at arenas and concert
halls throughout the country.

It's bchI years since Led Zeppelin or
Deep Purple released a studio album.
(irand l‘tink and Mountain broke up long
ago. as did other bands of the genre. yet
lilack Sabbath still remains. True, it's

and all-

 

 

 

 

 

bceu two years since the release of their

last album, and a lot has happened in that
time. Disco came into being and took over
the mainstream of popular music. The
teenage idol was reincarnated via Andy
Gibb and Shawn Cassidy. Punk rock
bands began to criticize anti demean the
older musical groups of the late sixties
and early seventies. III short, heavy metal
reached its all-time low. It was at this
point in time that Sabbath decided to
return.

The title of the album, Never Say Die.
reflects the band‘s basic attitude toward
the existence of heavy metal, a type of
music which has always been criticized as
being nothing but repetitive noise. The
virgin car will say that it is just loud.
wailing guitars. booming bass, and pouri—
ding drums. However. the experienced
car knows otherwise. It can pick out the
intricate licks of the guitar as they are
pumped out in conjunction with the vacal
arrangements and lyrics. It can delve past
the obligatory drum solos into the brutal,
aggressive beat of the tune.

This is why Black Sabbath has re-
mained a prominent musical power
through the demise of other heavy metal
bands. Their new album exemplifies the
quality that the band displays to synch-
ronize their music to their lyrics in order
to create an atmosphere of low life and
degradation. The same personnel are on
this album as were on the first.

()I the nine songs on the album, one
staudsout as painting a dingy portraitof a
gutter head, “johnny Blade.” The lyrics
tell of a grungy greaser. a product of his
neighborhood and “society's own child."
The story is sneered out by Osbourne in a
style that would make Johnny Rotten
cringe. ()sbourne's vocals are accentu-
ated by Iommi's guitai'work.

The title cut, “Never Say Ilic,” and “A
Ilard Road" are both worthy of ineution.
Ilotb cuts demonstrate the band's feelings

dings. Clever juxtaposition of long syn‘
thesioed harmonies with fast rhythms on
"Heroes" are effectively moving. Bowie's
ability to change rhythms and modulate
to new keys (obscuring a sense of tonal
direction) yet remain smooth throughout
is evident on such songs as “What in the
World." “Speed of Life," “Breaking
Glass." and "Beauty and the Beast."

That Bowie can perform such intricate
and sophisticated music in live pcrfoi'v
mance is of little surprise, especially when
he is accompanied by competent 'n'llltm
cians as he was. However. it is significant
that he does remain true to the original
