Athletics New Ballgame? A

_ SUNY presidents throughout the state seem to be favoring the
institution of a student tax which would be used to fund intercollegiate
athletics and cultural activities. This comes at a time when student
governments have been pushing for the raise of the 10.year-old $70 a
year student activities tax ceiling. These two issues bring up some
Interesting points.

Inessence, what the tax proposed by SUNY presidents represents is
shifting the administration and funding of athletics from student
governments to college presidents. However, it doesn’t shift the
responsibility of funding the tax at all.

Students will still have to pay for‘athletics in total, this in addition
to the money they will have to shell out for the student tax put to them
by the student governments. .

This proposed tax would give college administrations the power to
mandate how much and how large an athletic program will be and
how much money students will have to cough up for it.

It would alleviate the problem of student governments having to
give a large portion of their money to athletics at the expense of other
activities. It would also reduce the need to raise the tax ceiling, since
about 20 to 30 percent of the tax money which usually goes to athletics
would be gone. Gone from the student tax that is, but not from the

student’s pocketbooks.

This proposed tax is sure to cost students more, since administrators
are much more conscious of positive sports publicity than are
financially struggling SA’s, which have to contend with many diverse
groups.

In essence, this proposal would constitute a raise in tuition to fund
athletics. All of this shows a growing concern for athletics in SUNY.
And athletics are an important part of a university — last Saturday's
televised Danes-Ithaca game being a prime example.

But SUNY students should not bear the financial burden of an
athletic program alone. New York and Alaska are the only states in
the union which do not provide at least some funding for public higher
education athletic progrmas.

Perhaps this student tax is a good idea —— but only is the state chips
in about half of the price. The SUNY trustees should approach the
Division of the Budget ans ask for'state funding.

Wtih this funding, athletics will be able to survive, and the cost will
be shared by student and university — both entities which benefit

from athletic programs.

The ball is in SUNY Chancellor Clifton Wharton’s court. Thus far,
he has earned himself a delay of game penalty for being non-
committal on the tax ceiling issue. Wharton should act on this soon ——
for the sake of student governments and students —— and this action
should be for the benefit of students, without an unreasonable price

tag.

it should be stressed that inadequacies

directly, and cannot act on student
grievances.
