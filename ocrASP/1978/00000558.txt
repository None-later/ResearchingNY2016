"It‘s like a second season and
we intend to make it a better
one,” said Wenzel. The first

contained a few unsatisfying ties'

early in the fall and hit a low
ebb with a loss to Union on Oct.

the other regional matchup and
the Danes wouldn't mind the
opportunity to fix things if both
schools win and advance.
Albany comes sprawling into

brothers from Brooklyn. Carlos

forward from last year. pumped

occasionally lackluster offense.

there's no looking past anybody

The Dragons are seeded first

 JV Gridders Defeated ’By

Tough Division 1 Colgate

by Mike Dunne

Colgate victimized the Albany
State junior varsity football team
for 28 third quarter points and
then heldon to post a 35-28
victory over the Danes Friday on
University Field.

The two squads were dead-
locked at 7-7 near the end of the
first half with Albany in control
of the ball on their own 37-yard
line.

The ensuing play was an
unusual one, but in this case it
proved successful for the Danes.
End Tim Vortroaw took the ball
on a fake reverse and lofted a
long pass to Craig Trankla.

The play connected for a
63-yard scoring strike which

gave Albany a slim 14-7 halftime
advantage over the Division 1
Colgate team.

That play proved to be an
omen of the offensive circus that
was to occur in the second half

Albany muffed the opening
kickoff with the Red Raiders
pouncing on the ball deep in the
Dane territory. Colgate took the
ball in for the touchdown to even

The Red Raiders proceeded to
punch in three additional scores
as the third quarter ended with
Albany trailing 35-14. _

However. the Danes began to
get back on track in the final
period. John DiBeri picked off a
Colgate aerial and returned it 36
yards to paydirt. The PAT was

good and Albany had cut the
deficit to 35-21.

The Danes could manage only
one more touchdown as their
furious rally fell short of the
strong and physicalkedRaiders.

“Considering the caliber ~of
Colgate. we played pretty well."
said Albany coach Mike Ambro-
sto.
Ambrosio also noted that his
team could have had a slight
letdown from the previous two
weeks when they played in large
astroturf stadiums, and also the
commotion caused by the Danes-
Ithaca varsity contest, which
threw cveryone's concentration
and routines off.

The loss dropped the jayvee
gridders, who played their'big-
gest schedule ever. to 2-6 on the
season. They conclude their sea-
son today at Division I and Ivy
League foe Dartmouth.

game may shape up as a defens-
ive struggle. The rivalry has a
reccttt history of hard—fought,
well-played games, and this
match should not be an except-
ion. In the Cortland nets will be
Scott Manning, the
SUNYAC goalkeeper of last
year. He had eleven shutouts last
year. and 10 to date this year.
“He's been outstanding," descri-
bed Taube.

Arattgo has six shutouts this
year. and Taube notes, "Arango
is very quick ill the goal. and a
fierce competitor as well."

The Cortland defense will be
anchored by B rad Over. aided by
.less Daniels andJim Deng. “Our
defense has stabilized after some
early tnistakes, and right now,
we're as strong as we've been all
season." added Taube. The Alb—
any defense will start Pepe Agui-
lar. Vlado Sergovich, and Efram
Nezaj. Mark Wenzel may return
to action after being out with a
wrist injury. “We've missed

 

Wenzel — he could tnakc a big
difference out there if he could
play," said Schieffelin.

Both teams have their prob-
lems with injuries. Cortland took
a beating against LeMoyne. as
five players were injured. while
against Brockporl Albany suffer-
ed fout' injuries. "They'll all be
playing itt this one. I don't expect
it to be like Brockport.” said
Schieffclin. “but We've had out-
standing games against Cortland
over the ycars. and I expect this
to be one of them."

“The defense has been out-
standing. but we're not scoring.
We have to take more shots. and
get more pressure offensively to
win the game," concluded Sc-
hieffelin.

‘Blue and fullback Tim Coonrad.
In the lone victory over Marlst.

Blue rushed for what was a
season high 154 yards, and is the

‘speedster in the backfield.

According to Walsh. Coonrad
is "a hard nmner who sticks his
head inside and gets tough yards.
He carries the ball about half the
time."

When Budka goes to the air,
his prime receiver willmost likely
be Don Repole. “He's got god
speed, and that makes him a
dangerous receiver." said
Walsh.

“Their offense is their stren-
gth, and a wing-T is always tough
to defend against." added
Walsh. “On defense, we'll have
to play a well disciplined game."

Defensively, the Cardinals line
up in a familiar 4-4 alignment.
Much of the defensive spark has
been lost. though, as two key
performers were injured last
week in Cortland. TacklesMartin
Vahsen (6’4".220) and Tim
Diatnon (6'4", 230) have contri-
buted both size and strength to
the Cardinal front four. but both
will be on the sidelines against
the Duties.

Allowing almost 25 points a
game. the I’lattsburgh defense
has been somewhat effective up
until the last two weeks. when
they permitted 84 points. The
team leaders are linebacker
Frank Hartley (6'3", 205) attd
safety Glen Suddaby.

“This is the Week we‘d really
like to get our offense rolling}:
said Walsh. “But our main
objective is a good showing."

An exceptionally good show-

 

hnve said It's too good to quip.

ever, the Danes will not merciles-
sly pile on the points if they get a
chance to..

"I don't believe in nmning up
a score," said Ford. “We'll go as
hard as we can in the first half,
and if we have a good- enough
lead, I'll start putting in some
second stringers."

Two key Dane starters will not
even make the trip to Platts-
burgh. Tight‘end and punter Ed
Sellers suffered a brusied foot
against Ithaca. and will be side-
lined for the Cardinals. As a
replacement. Don Bowen will
handle the punting duties. Also
unable to play is halfback Jack
Burger, who is being rested with
a fractured bone in his right
hand.

Of utmost importance for the
Danes is a ‘big win over Platts-
burgh. but the preparation for
the Cardinals includes another
relevant aspect. "We can't afford
acomplaccnt week at this part of
the season," Ford said. "It is
important that we are on an
upswing."

The Danes hope that ttpswing is

was stunned last week by the
Danes. and must be able to
bounce back after last week's
loss." Ford added. “That loss
could have crushed them."

If the Danes return with the
expected victory over Platts—
burgh, they will be anxious to
find out how the other games
have resulted. “I suppose we'll
give Ithaca a call after we get
back," Ford quipped, “and then
we'll probably call St. Law-
rence.”

The phone bill will be worth it.

hoping for.
