"After a big game. there's

Bob Ford. “it sometimes is an

In order for the Dattes to be

they must not merely defeat the
Cardinals. but rttn past them

"Our team has. I sotne objec-

l‘ortl. “I feel we have a mature

need an impressive wiii over

chances."

After the sliockitig 15-8 loss to
a weak Buffalo sqttad a few
weeks back. the Danes learned a
very valtiable lesson that they
take with them to Plattssburglt.
"it's tough to take anybody

conmtetifed Dane cottcli Mike

Under first-year head coach

come out with a tricky wing-T
offensive setup. but have only
managed to score a stingy 12.0

attack is quarterback Jeff Bud-
ka. who is strictly a passer. as the
Cardinal version’of the wing—T
contains no quarterback ruttning

“Throwing quarterbacks have
