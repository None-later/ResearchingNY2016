Film Makers’ Group. Gets Funding

by Jeff Kennell‘ _

The University Cinematography
Association (UCA) has been
budgeted for $5,645.50. including a
$2,000 income line. for l978-79 by
CentralCouncil. Final approval of
the budget has been given by SA
President Paul Feldman.

The budget passed with a large
majority with 22 council members
voting ves. four no. and three
.abstaining. Central Council Chair
Dave Ruffo felt the reason for the
budget's substantial margin in
pgssage lie in a Sl.000 rider bill.
“They [ UCA] will be funded through
their first major production." said
Ruffo. but will receive no further
funding until they meet the ﬁrst
“.000 of their income line.

UCA hopes to create and produce
two movie features and five ﬁlm
briefs, called Campus Shorts. UCA
Advisor Mitch Chazan projected an
early December debut for the ﬁrst
Campus Shorts and set a tentative

completion date of late' December
for the first feature film. According
to UCA President Rich Shoenberg.
the script has already been written
and approved for the feature
production.

Of the income line. Shoenberg
' said. “honestly. I think we can come
very close to it. A lot of people have
cotnc up with ideas about raising
money.“ According to Shoenberg.
UCA will hold fund raisers such as
professionally produced ﬁlms, guest
lecturers. and student produced
films. “Another possibility is doing
work on commercial spots for local
businesses." said Shoenberg.

UCA is a newly formed group.
'dedicated to “establishing an
atmosphere conducive to motion
picture production." according to
Shoenberg.

UCA currently has [20 members.
and Shoenberg emphasized that “we
have unlimited membership
possibilities. We ol'fera good way for
interested people to branch out."

\

\Cliazan deseribed UCA as a “good
training program for anyone
planning to go into any aspect offilm
making.“ UCA Chair and Executive
Producer Mark Rappaport said
group membership is diversified and
somewhat experienced. in that
certain members are already
"successful independent film
makers."

Another possible source ofmoney
for UCA is provided by a line in the
budget which allows $l00 in entry
fees for any of 5,000 film contests.
l-‘inancial awards and trophies are
available in these world-wide
contests. and entry fees are necessary
for the group to maintain rights to its
film. “It's a way to bring money to
the group through things we've
done.“ said Shoenberg.

“We‘re on a very strained budget.
but we'll get by." said Shoenberg. “I
was conﬁdent with the support we
received from council members and
the faculty." he added.

Slioenberg and Rappaport said
