CURVE CUT

The Berlei Company. Britain‘s
leading manufacturer of women‘s
uttdcrcluthing. reports that the
shape of women is changing
dramatically.

Tailors working for the firm
report that a recent measuring of
4000 women has discovered that
women are becoming more tube-
shaped. The Company says that over
the past 25 years. women Itave not
only become taller. but they‘ve
developed smaller breasts and hips
and thicker waists.

A similar survey conducted by
Sears Roebuck in the United States
also noted a move away from the so-
callcd “hourglass shape" toward
what it called a “straightening ofthe
curves.“ Says a BcrIei Company
spokesperson: "One might even say
the (women) are becoming more
man-shaped."

THUMBING IT

A Munich doctor has triggered
cries of "sexism" in Germany by
testifying that women are unsuited
for most blue—collar work because
their thumbs are short and clumsy.

Doctor Karl Juritza. ina five-page
documan submitted to Munich's
city government. says that men
should continue to be favored over
women when it comes totraining for
such jobs as fitters. mechanics and
electricians.

The paper contends that women
are an average of IO percent smaller
than men. and that having smaller
thumbs makes them less-fitted to
Work with their hands. Oddly
enough. the paper notes that while
women are generally smaller than
males. they may actually have longer
index lingers.

Members of the “alumni Social
Democratic Women complain that
this is the same age-old story; men
are once again simply trying to keep
women ttndcr their over-sired
thumbs.

 

SMOG BABIES _

A UCLA study has found that
babies born in the smoggieat parts of
Los Angeles weigh significantly less
than normal infants. - '

TheLos Angeles AirWesources
Board says that not only do new-
borns in smoggy areas weigh an
average of l I ounces lessat birth. but
their mortality rate is l7 percent
higher than babies born in parts of
the city with cleaner air.

It has previously been discovered
that the babies born to women who
smoke tend to be underweight. and
to have lesser chances for survival.‘
According to Tom Quinn of the Air
Resources Board: “The UCLA study
indicates that air pollution may have
an effect equivalent to that caused by
a mother smoking a pack of
cigarettes a day."

IN THE BAG
The student body at the University
of Georgia elcctcd an "unknown
candidate“ last semester as president
who campaigned for the election
wearing a bag over his head.

Roger Strauss originally ran for
the office because his fraternity sup-

to place a large "baggie" over the

Strauss a chance of winning the elec-

percent of the vote.

STOMACH STRAIN

Surgeons at Ohio State University
are helping overweight people lose
weight by literally stapling their
stomachs shut.

Doctors at the University have
performed about 30 gastric
staplings since I July of I977.
a rd report that patients lose an
average of to pounds per month for
the ﬁrst six months.

The doctors say they place a dou-
ble row of surgical staples near the
top of the stomach. leaving only
enough room to allow a small open-

‘ing through which food passes into

the stomach and intestinal tract.

The stomach can then hold only
two or three ounces of food. and the
patient is forced to change his or her
eating habits.

Ihc stapling procedure. which is
only used on patients who are I00
pounds or more above their ideal
weight. is reportedly less time con-
sttntillg. less expensive and less risky
than the more widely publicized in-
testinal bypass surgeries.
