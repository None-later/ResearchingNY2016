The Danes did all THEY could.
What was essential was a one-sided
victory over Plattsburgh on
Saturday. and then wait and see how

Ithaca and St. Lawrence made out.

Albany_ held their part of the
bargain. methodically shoving aside
the Cardinals 32-7. It was the others
that didn't come through.

Albany 'saw their record improve
to 7-2 and' had little difficulty with
the l-7 Plattsburgh squad. The
unuriisiic whipping (live Dane
fumbles) was both a tribute to the
Dane power and the ineptncss of the
Cardinals.

Linebacker Don Hyde provided
much of the Danes heroics in what
was an all-around solid defensive
effort. Hyde intercepted three of
Cardinal quarterback Jeff Budka's
passes. and sparked the Albany
defense early when he blocked a ﬁeld
goal attempt in the first quarter.‘

After a 74—yard drive, capped by
lirad Aldrich's 2-yard touchdown
run. it was Don Bowen's turn to
shine. A premier punt return

 

specialist. Bowen gave the Danes a

12—0 lead with a brilliant 49-yard
return for six points. The sophomore
defensive back now has both of the
Danes' touchdown returns this
season. the first a 68 yarder way back
in the second game against Southern
Connecticut.

Rich I'leinierle also had a big day,

for Albany. He picked off two
passes. and made likea running back
in returning his first interception 36
yard. setting up a Tony Moschella
split-end reverse into the endlone
and a iii-0 halftime lead.

The Dane defense had little trouble
stalling the Cardinal attack.
allowtng a scant two first downs in
the lirsl hail. lhe second quarter.
however. did prove painful for one
Albany player. as Aldrich suffered a
bruised hip and was replaced by
lerry Walsh. Aldrich's injury was
not serious.

Repole. This was the only .

breakdown in what was is denying
Albany defense. Led by the inspired
play of defensive end Jim Dignan.
the Cardinals could manage only 72
rushing yards the entire game.

A quarterback sack by tackle

the hall. and Walsh promptly went ..

tor a quick aerial score. His 66~yard
bomb to a sprinting Fred
lircwington was the longest pass
play of the season, and gave the
Danes their final margin. For
Iirewington. it was another of his
patented big-play touchdowns that
he has accomplished on a number of
occasions. V

The Albany offense was not at its
precision hcst aginst the Cardinals.
btit did have some excellent
performances. Fullback Mike
Mirabella again provided the
consistent. tackle-breaking running
that the Danes offense depends on.
and totaled a solid lib) yards on 20
carries. Levi Louis added hit. as the
squad tallied 387 total yards against
a lenient l’iattshurgh defense.

7-2 Danes Miss Out On NCAA ’s

Albany head coach Bob Ford.
“Someone had to lose. either Ithaca,
or someone nationally. for us to Itave
a chance. I have no qualms with the
selection process or the selection
committee. We had our destiny in
our hands and we let it slip away."
The choices reveal that the NCAA
did yield to the temptation of
grabbing three teams from one area
at the expense of another that only
sends one entry. Baldwin-Wallace.

“All three from Ohio are
undefeated and exceptional teams so
we had to shy away from the 2-2—2-2
split we like to obtain." said Stiles.
" I new are a lot of good teams that
didn‘t make it and Albany isjust one.
I sincerely wish we could expand this
tournament to l2 teams but wejust
can‘t afford to with the money and
the time considerations."

Munsey used the same strategy of
