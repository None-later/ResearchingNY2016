Dario Arango’s Questionable Ejection ‘
Crucial In Booter’s' 2-1 Playoff Defeat

by Ken Kurtz

"It was it very unfortunate thing.
there's no question in my mind that
we cotttd have gone It” the way in the
tournament.“ said Albany State
soccer coach Bill Scltieft'clin as he
described the Danes‘ 2-! loss to host
Cortland in the first round of the
\CAA tournament Saturday
afternoon. "I tliitik it was a question
of highway robbery.“

\\‘ith 8:30 left in tile game and
.r\lb.iii_\ leading l-tl. tlie trailing
referee called Albany goalkeeper
'l)ario Arango for a foul iii the
pcttttll) area. Ilic resulting penalty
\llt)l was successfullydriven home by
.\eil Moore to tie the game. Arango
scooped ttte ball out of the net and
flipped it underhandcd tti tfte
referee. the official on the far side of
tire field interpreted ttiis as an action
deserting a red card. and be ejected
Arango from the game.

"I didn‘t see the tool which
resulted in the penalty kick.“
reported Cortland coach I‘red
Iaubc, "Alter ttie kick. I didn‘t see

“Dario never touched their player.
and tie itevcr came close to tryitig to

toticli the referee." said Schiefellin.‘

Prior to the action in front til the net.
Robinson had been awarded a
yellow card for roughing Arango. The
yellow card wariitrig was one of the
three which Cortland recc'iyed prior
to the Incident tn front of the cage.
Interestingly enough. it was
Robinson who wastigtun involved iii

"Dario over-reacted. but it must be

"It wasa fairlyeven game up to the

“I was more excited about the

thought we were going to get

So did all the experts. An
unofficial coaches poll picked the
harriers at utiriiher t'otir while
Albany coach ltob Mtiiiscy had

Once again the (treat Danes

“One reason I run so well was the

“I never had run cross country

0 Rally Urges SUNY Divestment

by Jill Haber

Chanting “SUNY Out of Africa.
Divest Now." protestors circled
around the Campus Center
fountain, listened to three brief
speeches. and then marched across
campus into the administration
building at a noontimc rally
yesterday.-

l'he rally. sponsored by the
SUNYA Committee Against
Apartheid (CAA), drew about 45
participants initially btit the number
swelled to over l00 for a walk into
the administration building.

the demonstrators carried signs
atid chanted slogans calling for the
divestment of the $5 ritillion of
SUNY endowment fund stocks in
corporations which have ties to
apartheid South Africa.

the cries of the protestors drew
uncertain smiles from observers who
stopped to watch the action on the
podium. Bystanders were handed

leaflets and asked to sign petitions
calling for divestment.

CAA Clonvenor Tom Capuano
steppetl uponto the base ofthe dry
fountain and through a megaphone
called for an “end to the SUNY
support of the racist regime of South
Africa."

the megaphone was passed to
Albany State University Black
Alliance (ASUBA) Chair Howard
Strakcr. who called South Africa by
its African name, "Azania." and
claimed that “lfwe [the U. S.] pulled

otit. they [the South African Blacks] ‘

would have better living conditions."

Straker later said that African
conferences have resulted in
positions advocating divestment as a
step towards liberation.

'FinanCial Aids Are Broadened

by Debby Smith
Students from middle income
families will be receiving tnore
financial help from the federal
gowrnment as a result of President
t'arter‘s signing of the Middle
Income Assistance ttill on Nov. I.
the ltasic litluctitionitl
Upportiiity (irants (“1306)
program has been greatly expanded.
and Will become available to families
with higher incomes next fall.
according to SUNYA Financial
Aids Director Donald Whitlock.
llic program currently is not
available to families with incomes
exceeding $|4.000. according to
Whitlock. and will now be available
to families with incomes as high an
525.000.
“there‘s been tremendous
expansion of the program." said
Whitlock. “'I'here‘s little question

that it will have great impact."

Wliitlock said that 2000 SUNYA
students currently receive llEOG.
arid that this figure waill expand to
as many as lwo-tthirds ot'thc
undergrads wh_o are enrolled at least
hall-time.

“ llie ligtirc will at least double.“
said Whitlock.

to addition to the IiliOG program
expansion. middle income students
will no longer have to pay interest on
federally guaranteed loans.
Previously. students with fantin
incomes exceeding 525.000 had to
pay interest oti the lottns.

the Middle Income Assistance
ll'itl fully subsidich interest on all
federally guaranteed loans which are
administered through the New York
State Higher Education Services
Corporation. (HESC),

" this means as long as students

remain engaged in at least half-time
study. no repayment of principle or
interest will be required." said
Whitlock. “Reptiyiiient tofthe loan)
will commence nine months after a
student ceases to be enrolled at least
half-time.“

l'rcvrously. students with adjusted
faintly incomes of $25.000 or over
paid interest while iii-school. during
the ninth month grace perios after
the sttideiit leaves school, arid after
that when the student starts paying
back the loan.

the result of the new bill is that
any students cart take out a student
loan with the interest fully
subsidized; there is no longer an
