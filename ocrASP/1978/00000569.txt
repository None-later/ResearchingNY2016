organization‘s commitment to
“academic freedom. tenure,
governance. and related principles.”
AAUI’ publicly censured SUNY
in June I978, concluding that the
rctrenchments were effected “with
disregard for tenure. due notice. and
the role of the faculty." NEA has
sought to use this to both bolster its
image and to cast doubt on UUP's

ability to negotiate job security.

According to an NEA news release
oi Oct. 23. the AAUI’ censure report
characterized the UUP
retrenchment program as "weak and
Incllcctive." and giving SUNY
nntnagctncnt “virtually a free hand
lll laying off individuals and
eliminating departments."

~Vying - Unions Shﬁncléar 0n   A

However, the wording of the
censure report. made public last
August. criticizes not UUP but
SUNY. “The administration . . .” it
reads. “disregarded the Board of'
trustee's policies as well as the
policies supported by the AAUP." It
goes on to acknowledge the necessity
ol retrenchment, and by implication
the necessity of a retrenchment
clause. but criticizes the
administration for violating
standards of academic propriety.

Since joining hands with NEAT

however, AAUI’ has taken to
eriticiti ng U Ul"s retrenchment
clause. AAUI’ Representation

L'ommittee Chair Eugene Vasilew,
who is a SUNY at Binghamlon
prolessor. blamed the retrenchment

 

boondogglc .lon UUP's “poor
contract." I , g -

“UUP has. been giving away too
much.“ he charged. “essentially
destroying tenure."

This is rather interesting. because
AAUP negotiated a contract with
the University of Rhode_lsland in
I975 in which the retrenchment
clause is basically a duplicate of
s U N Y‘s retrenchment clause.
People in glass houses . . .

Unfortunately. the bottom line to
all of this is that there is ultimately
no way to prevent retrenchment. and
no available means by which SUNY
employees cart predict which group
will do the most to further the cause
of job security. UUI’ has failed once.
and is offering little but rhetorical

     
  

changes in the clauae.this time
around. On the other hand, NBA has
done little ‘but criticize UUP.
Perhaps the only concrete basis of
distinction is the fact that UUP,
since it endorsed Governor Carey's
successful re—election campaign,
may have more pull in the executive
mansion.

Finally, it may be proper to
question the necessity of
prol‘EssIonul unions at all. At least
one SUNYA professor. Morris Eson
ol the Psychology department,
thinks SUNY employees would be
better off without them.

" My position isthut people should
\‘otc for‘no rcpresentution.‘ " he said

last night. “When we had a union, '

they retrenched. We. could use the
loot million dollars [in dues] for
better purposes.

I “The union contract makes us

vulnerable tothose points which it
doesn’t cover." -

Win, lose, or draw, it is not likely
that the outcome o'f'the election will
have much of a tangible effect on the
state of SUNY- labor relations. As
UUP staff member John Converse
put it, “there is really very little one
can do to prevent retrenchments."
Rather, whichever group is given the
gauntlet in December must be strong
enough to keep the SUNY
administration within the
parameters of both its contract and
academic propriety.
