Students and faculty members

involved in the ﬁrst program were
also contacted.

“There was an investigation of
other programs, government
agencies. and businesses. What was
needed as far as an education from
an environmentalist. was a set of
skills in an identifiable area of
knowledge and a view of how these
skills tie in.with the program."
explained Hamilton.

lite first program began in the
early I970‘s and lasted until I975.
Ihe structure of this program was
weak. said Hamilton. because
students were involved with too
much field work.
