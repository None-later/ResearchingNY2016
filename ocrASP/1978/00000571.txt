Vasectomy Verity

Stanford University Professor
Doctor Robert Kessler is warning
that vasoctomy candidates should
consider the sterilizing operation
permanent. despite increasing
reports ofsucccssful reversals ofthe
surgery. ,

A vasectomy is a surgical
procedure which interrupts the flow
of sperm by cutting the tubes that
carry the sperm. The sperm is then
absorbed into the body. ,

Kcssler reports that reverse
vasectomics are only 25 to 33 percent
effective because men who have
\Iascctomics often build up
antibodieslotheirownsperm,which
then cause the sperm to stick
together or become immobilized.

Sperm antibodies are not
normally formed in the male body
because the sperm never reaches the
bloodstream. Kessler says. but after

carrying the sperm can be ruinited in

the antibody factor may still keep a

It all started when 12-year-old

Ulrike says she plans to continue

most rigorous tests ever conducted for a
vaginal contraceptive. Results were
excellent—showing that Encare Oval
provides consistent and extremely high
sperm-killing protection.This recent US.

pean laboratories and clinics.

Each Encare Oval insert contains a pre-
cise. premeasured dose of the potent.
sperm-killing agent nonoxynol 9. Once

gently effervesces. dispersing the sperm-
killlng agent within the vagina.
