 Polumbo's Son

here’- no such thing as an

innocent bystander." John

Polumbo any; so —’ and true

to his word, from the moment

his red suede Ineakers hit the
gage last Saturday for the UCB—
honored beneﬁt concert that he gave for
Telethon, there wasn‘t an innocent
byltandcr left in the Campus Center
Ballroom. :r-

Gayl Meyermann

 

Polumbo used to be leader. lead
vocalist, and songwriter for “Crack the
Sky."'He‘s now on his own, having most

recently recorded his ﬁrst solo album,
“Innocent Bystander," for Lifesong
records.

Lifesong is a most appropriate label for
Palumbo, for rarely does an artist bare so
much of his life, so much of our life, in a
short evening's time. From his bittersweet
reminiscences ofa warm childhood friend
gone cold in old age; through the tired
resignation of 7 his uncle, the barber,
trapped by hisjob; to the pain of divorce
(his own) and death (his mother‘s);
l’olumbo was chronicler of the life of our
emotions. And yet, amidst all this sadness
and pain, he invariably fortnd a word to
twist, a sudden change of key, a
meaningful pause and (here we go again),
with comic irony the situation was ripe
for laughter.

l’olumbo wasjust not capable of feeling
sorry for himself, or anyone else, for too
long. He wasn't about to let his audience
stand by straight—faced, tight-Iippcd, or
starry—eyed any longer than it took to
build that emotional bond ofcommonality
he needed to carry us over into his world

 
 

RECORD TOWN’SM.

 

\

with a release of our tension in laughter.
In “It‘s Okay to Die" after weaving a
maudlin description of the imminent
death of a young child, Polumbo
concluded with the words,“. . .and Lucy
and Jesus will / dance like a vaudeville /
team up to the sky / . . . It‘s okay to die,"
and he left us with the message, “Notice
that the one‘s who are / crying are the
ones who’ve been left behind."

Polumbo's music was in itself
compositionally fine — a montage of pop
rhythms and precise vocals. His piano
was not so much an accompaniment as it
was a partner to his lyrics ~
complementing, questioning, and
implementing, they goaded each other
on to run the range of emotions at an
often breathtaking pace.

Enjoying'thc clever intricacy of his
words and music in concert, we might‘
anticipate that his album, presenting much,
of the same music with the embellishment
of acoustic and electric guitars, bass,
drums, electric keyboard, and the
background vocals of (surprise!)
“Badfinger” might be all the more clever;
due to all that potential for adding new
dimensions to his already rich montage of
sound. But those of US having SUCh
expectations cannot help but feel
disappointed by “Innocent Bystander".
I’olumbo‘s voice seems somehow rougher
on the album, his personality is buried in
thcjumble of his rather ordinary back-up
instrumentation. All of that
ovcrproduccd instrumental work,
common though it may be, succeeds in
diminishing the power of Polumbo‘s
vocals. His backup isjust not as adept in
the quick turns of tune and meaningful
pauses as he is when alone with his piano.
In short, “Innocent Bystander" m_isses

songs that touched the heart and iunnybone. (Photo: Mark Halek)

‘l’olurnbo's strongest musical marks,
leaving the listener standing by, wishing
that somehow he could give us something
more.

But Polumbo in concert did give us far
more. something which distinguishes him
clearly from the rest: his rich and multi—
faceted sense of humor. His humor
rangcd from the outrageous hilarity of a
“Family Man“ at his wits and trying to
cope with u prostitutc daughter, a
sexually avant-gardc son, and a
promiscuous wife; to the barbed humor
of “Mormon Disco" (Mormons own
everything is sight / Keep Niggcrs out /

chp Utah white / Donny and Marie are'

alright by me“), to a painful humor with a
keen cutting edge, which he was very

  

facile at turning in the wounds he made,
as he did in the song, “Sweet
Mongoloids".

“Sweet Mongoloids" was, in fact, part
of the reason l’olumbo was there in the
ﬁrst place. He wrote the song seven years
ago while working with specialchildrcn in
a West Virginia hospital, ajob which left
him marvelling at the children‘s
appropriate approach to a world which
was nowhere as appropriate in its
responses to them. Through hearing the
song, Concert Board though he was a
likely choice for a Telethon beneﬁt, and
so did he, and the result was a very
pleasant evening for a very small pricc‘for
a very good cause.
