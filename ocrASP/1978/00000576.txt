Diversion

Now that the Withdrawal period
is over. and you have decided to go
through the appeal system to drop
that course you no longer are in love
with. what do you do? Well, this
week‘s Diversion is devoted to some
handy-dandy excuses to give profs
for dropping a course:

Failure (no. not in the course.
hccaust.’ profs like to flunk a few kids
to keep the bell curve.) Tell them that
it is failure in life you‘re afraid of.
that if this course isn't dropped you
would certainly become a failure in
life. your girlfriend would leave you
and your father would cut off your
funds. Show up in the ofﬁce in
lnltcrcd clothes with a tin cup that
says “Aims for the Dcstitutc
Accounting Failure." Cry 2: lot. Evcn
Cannon would feel sorry.
Sickness. Develop a highly
communicable disease and if the
prof doesn't drop you. threatcn to sit
in the first sent and cough :1 lot.
Threats. Simple. Wear dark glasses
and say that you've got a cousin
(luido who likes to drink motor oil
with his corn flakes and has a mean
temper toward profs.

Death. This is that last resort.
Simply kill off one of your closest
relatives and tell the profthut you're
too broken up to goon in the course.
Some students have had 23
grandparents die in a college career.
Or perhaps your cat died and you're
lfl mourning for nine weeks. But
alas, you can jump Out of a lower.
then bring the prof your death
certificate then you're sure to
wuhdrnw from that class.

Divest’ Now

Yesterday, a- demonstration was held on campus calling for SUNY to
divest the stocks it holds in corporations which support racially
segregated South Africa. . ‘ p

The demonstration had all of the elements of the art which had been
perfected in the sixties, but forgotten in the seventies: chants, signs,
speeches, and even a march on the administration building. All of the
SA types were there, along with other student leaders united in an
attempt to drive a message home to SUNYA.’

The message was clear: “SUNY Out of 'Africa, Divest Now."
Currently, SUNY has $5 million worth of investments in corporations
which support this apartheid government. SUNY has no right to
support such a government and attempt to call itself an institution of
higher learning. ’

However, one question about this demonstration is why it was held on
campus, and not downtown at the Chancellor’s office. If one looks at the
records, SUNY at Albany has virtually no investments in such stocks.
And SUNYA President Vincent O'Leary is not a spokesperson for the
entire SUNY system; nor should anyone expect him to be.

A possible reason behind the decision to march on this campus was
the frustration that has been experienced in attempting to get SUNY

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cable on Campus

by llrlun Levy

Yes, Virginia. lhcrc will be (‘nblc 'l V hcrc
sotnctlny. but you must be patient. It takes
nmc. lltis ttrticlc is to nnswcr questions
concerning the Cubic 'l'V projcct. and to tell
why things arc the way they are.

l initiated this project in Scplcmbcr 1977.
and have been working with it over thc putt 14
months. [‘11 personally ttttcst to thc ftth that
ccltmg cable tv on this campus is not the
clmcsl thing in the world to do. It doesn't
happcn right away. l’hcrc are many things to
he worked out. such as construction. cost
csunmtcs. financing, type of set-up. ctc.
Although many people have not heard from
file cable tv project since thc original intcrnst
stuvcy (December 1977). then: has almost
always been progress, somctlmcs fast.
sometimes painfully slow. The SUNYA
('nhlc IV Task Force was formed during
lhc Spring ‘75 semester. which gave
administrative bucking to thc project.
t'omposcd of“, related administrators
(tcsldcucc. l’lnnt department. and others)
members of thc li.C.C. (our TV studios) nnd3
students. the task force has bccn working to
dcvclopc an ideal set—up for dorms and
duckling on a plan to linuncc it. In addition.
lhc lttsk Force has to find an efficient and
economical way to do the necessary
construction, and n way to finance it. Then.-
\\L'IL' and still are other questions to he
answered. In the time you've been thinking
"what happened to that Cable TV idctl'l."
answers were being worked out and problems
wclc being solved.

t\llt)lllcl‘ reason for the time dcltty, is tlntt we
have to deal with one cable television
company. that is not us enthusiastic as people
"Hill" cxpcct. considering the potential
murkcl.

Ihc Incl is. fltnt some colleges flnn lutvc
('anC IV luld several companies llntt wcrc
competitively biddlngfor the franchise in their
area. 'l llcsc colleges. bcingtt major subscribct'
and having n big say in thc tn'cn, wcrc offcrcd
llcc sct vices and other time and money saving

Iulcs. Ilo\\c\ct. wc only ll:t\c onc company in
lIlll .nc.t to dual \lllll.

So. the llmc clupscd bctnccn \‘lsils of the
company's cnulllccls to tuspccf fol costs can
spun .t pctlnd of \vccks to months.

.\o\\ ouc might say. "Wily isn't this
company ctllhusiztstic‘! look at the money
tltcy'll tuztkc." Actually, they don't comc out as
null as you would think. llns job is not like
pulling a cubic by a row of houses and then
tonnccttng u to nulls. ll involvcs problems
post-d pul'llully by four. lwcnly-onc story
tout-1s. In addition. it is unique in that every
\ucnnon. :1 huge pcrccntugc will want scrvicc
shut off when thcy lcttvc. and service turned on
ugtnn when thcy comc back. So although thch
Is a potentially Inrgc mnrkct ofcuslomcrs to
CIlllL‘L‘ this company. it‘snot nllcnkcforthcm,

ho. whole are we now'! lfow much further
till we have to go?

Right now. the task force has tcnfivcly
tlccltlctl on u lcusihlt: plan to shoot for. which
would cvcntunlly pttt thc hook~up in suites.
Ulll company has been up to inspect the
quads. and will be up again soon to gct more
t‘MlCl mcusurcmcnts ttlltl purnmctcls of the

f‘nllowmg this comes a scl'ics of negotiations
llt‘lWL'CIl the company and the (‘nblc

Chancellor Clifton Wharton‘s opinion on the issue. -

Phone calls and queries have been met with the same answer: the
Chancellor‘s calendar is too busy to deal with this issue right now. Nicely
worded form letters have. been sent out to student leaders explaining
this.

An issue like this certainly deserves Wharton’s immediate attention.
'l‘imc can be made from a busy schedule. and the question ofdivcstment
should be met directly rather than the stalling that has occurred.

littch day that Wharton doesn’t address divestment is a day in which
SUNY supports corporations which deal with South Africa,
corporations which better the economy of this racist regime.

The student leaders have asked President O‘Leary for his support in
this issue. Such support would‘givc the movement towards divestment
some moral backing from a respected president of one ofthe major cogs
in SUNY. _ -

It would be nice, but O’Leary has remained non-commital on the
issue. lie is in an understandably awkward position: SUNYA has no
stocks to speak of, and he does not speak for all of SUNY.

It is Wharton who should be pressured. It is Wharton who should stop
writing form letters and show some good form of his own. And it is
Wharton who should begin the pvocess towards divesting SUN‘t stocks
in racist South Africa.
