games. Blmbo‘s Bombers defeated
Gammon l9-2 to win the Lg. ll title

Also on Saturday. the Original
Dcrelicts, a team that has been
playing ﬂag-football for four years,

a victory over Hairpies. Previously.

Spikers Finish

by Janet E. Cernl

the Albany State women's
volleyball team failed to advance
past the Nov. 4th round-robin Dis-
trict competition with a ﬁfth-place
llnislt out of lo teams. "We played
very poortly and the team knows it
and agrees. It just wasn't our day."
said first-year Albany coach Susan
Harrington.

“When I was younger I never
really knew that people ran during
the off-season." Lavan said with a
sound of innocence. "I sort ofalways
thought everybody ran during the
season and the people who ran very
well, it sort ofcamc natural to them.
I decided lwnntcd to work hard over
the summer for my final season of
cross country.“

he was firmly in the position to instill
his brand of team unity into the
squad. The idea of the "team"
coming first has pervaded his
running career, and even dominated
u.

“I enjoy being captain now that I
think about it and maybe my
influence has helped eliminate any
bickering on the team this year. we
get along well and have a riot
together." Lavan said. “The second
part of the year everybody has come
through with almost unbelievable
consistency and it helps us
personally; knowing you can count
on each man."

nicknames to his runners, the couch
dubbed anan LP. or Little Pimp.

“llcy l.l’ are you saying anything
bad in there to that fellow about
me.“ Munscy screamed at his
captain earlier this week after
practice. “You probably are just
trying to get back at me after all
those things I‘ve said to you. huh.
Well just watch out."

Luvun looked up and then replied
in the prompt. crisp, unpretentious
manner he always takes on. “ljust
told him I wish my cross country
career could go on forever, coach."
