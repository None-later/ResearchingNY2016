Repeat 8-2 Mark EnticeSrDanes . . r

by Paul Sehwart:

Nothing against the Springfield
College squad, but the Danes would
rather not be playing them
tomorrow. And in place of
University Field, Albany would just
as soon be far away from their
friendly home turf.

It's the NCAA playoffs Albany
craves. but like a star, the NCAA's
arc unreachable, at least for this
year. Instead, the 7-2 Danes will
have to muster up enough emotion
and incentive to push them past the
tough Division ll Chiefs.

"I was impressed with the team
altitude this week,“ said Albany
head coach Bob Ford. “We had to
bounce back after finding out we
didn't get the bid.

"We‘d really like to win
tomorrow‘s game,“ continued Ford.
"When you lose the last game ofthe
season. it leaves a bitter taste in your
month over the months off. It would
be nice to go into next season with a
Inc game winning streak."

/\ good deal of incentive might
conic from the Dane personnel,
\shiclr features l7 seniors, including
It) offensive starters. 'l'hesc players
will no doubt want to make lheirlast
game a winning effort.

A victory will not entire easy,

  

though, despite the Chiefs 3-6
record. Springfield plays an
unusually difﬁcult schedule that is
dotted with Division I and H
opponents. Among the six setbacks
are losses to Nonheastern, Ithaca.
and MC, all exceptionally tough
teams. Last week against Division I
New Hampshire, the Chiefs ran up
35 points, but their defense fellapan.
allowing 56.

l'he Springﬁeld team is noted for
their hefty physical size, with both
the offensive and defensive lines
averaging about 225 pounds per
man. “They try to overpower you,"
said Dane coach Mike Walsh. “They
are definitely a tough ballelub.“
y Using an l-formation, the Chiefs
rely on a hard-charging ground
attack. Leading the assault is a pair
of rugged, young running backs —
freshman Steve Dowd (6'0", I90)
and sophomore Norm England
(0‘3", 207). Last week the Chief
ground attack was held in check,
Willi Dowd gaininng yards and
bngland adding 45. The Fullback
spot is shared by George Richardson
and l)arrc| llill, both quality
performers.

At quarterback. the Chiefs have
another first-rate player in Pete
Watson (6'2", I90). The senior had

-an exceptional day against New ‘

Hampshire, completing 20 of 33
tosses for 282 yards and two
touchdowns. Watson's key receiver
is lengthy John Cherry (6'4",
200)who corraled nine passes for l36
yards a week ago.

The Springfield 5-2 monster
defense has allowed almost 25 points
a game so far this season, but has
strength up the middle. Noseguard
Brian Haller (6’l", 210) leads the
defensive charge, and is backed up
by two stellar linebackers, Mark
Harriman and Hank Hughes: The
demanding monster back position is
capany ﬁlled by_junior Jim Quinn.

Fine Defense

In last year‘s matchup, the Danes
played one of their ﬁnest defensive
ballgames and won l0-7. catapulting
Albany into the NCAA playoffs.
With a victory tomorrow. the Danes.
can match last year's banner 8-2
mark. Throughout the inconsistent
play and occasional breakdowns, the
Danes still have managed to put
together another ﬁne season.

“We're .7-2," said Ford, "and I
know a helluva lot of teams that
would like to have that record."

l‘or many learns, 7-2 would be an
exceptional season. For the Danes,
it's anothcryearof upgrading whatis
already a highly successful program.
So successful, that it‘s 8-2 that they
aunt. and probably won‘t be
satisfied unless they get it.
