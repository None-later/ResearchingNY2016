Spirited Harriers West For

by Jeff Carone
Today the AlbanyStato cross

.country team is going to add a twist

to their usual practice. The squad is
going to have a dry run over the
opponent's course. There normally
is not a need for this because either
they or head coach Bob Munsey has
a working knowledge of the terrain.
However. this week‘s race is being
run over a course neitherthe harriers
nor Munsey has 'any experience
with.

There is a good reason forthis lack
of a scouting report. The race is on a
golf course in Iowa. near Augustana

. College, which is beyond the normal

paths of the Albany runners. The
race is the NCAA Division III
National Championships. It Is the
ultimateineompetitionfortheGreat
Danes.

Fortunately for the barriers they
will not be alone in their
unfamiliarity. Another 28 teams
from across the country will also be
seeing the Course for the ﬁrst time.
with the possible exception of a
couple of Iowa qualifiers. It is safe
to saythat for the most part the meet
will be equal from a course
knowledge standpoint.

The" Albany squad earned their
way to the Nationals last Saturday at

the District ll Qualifying Meet.
Districr'll encompasses New York
State and is sending four
representatives to the Iowa meet.
Fredonia. Plattsburgh. and St.
Lawrence are the ‘other qualifying
teams along with Albany.

The race itself is different from
any the barriers have run thus far
this year. Although the team has
been in several multi~team meets the
latter part of the season. none are of
comparable size to the Nationals.
The entrants, will total between 230
and 240 runners as opposed to the 80
runners in the Qualifying meet.

The number is down from last
year‘s 52-team meet and over 300
runners because of the new
Qualifying meet standard.
Previously. teams were selected at
large by a committee with no set
number of teams participating. The
number this year is more
manageable. but still larger than
what the Great Danes are used to.

the inﬂux of runners will cause
problems for the runners in their
ability to move around. There is
much more jockeying for position
involved and can seriously hamper a
runner‘s pace.

u‘lt is goingto be tough to do well.”
said Sean Reilly. a member of last

year's qualifying team. “It's a zoo
there." .

“You get the feeling of being lost."
said Munsey. “there are people all
over the place." ‘

Munsey explained that a runner is
always around a group of other
runners. He has given the squad a
basic strategy to cope with the
problem: “Go out with the
momentum of the pack for the first
one-half to three-fourths mile at the
start. Then start aiming for targets.
'lhe main thing is to pick out one
man. The pace the group takes is not
the pace you will ride. you have to
keep stepping it up." Ilc finishes on a
note of caution. "If you go with the
stream you are dead.“

'Aibany has an added benefit in
that four of its seven runners were at
the Nationals with last year‘s team.
Reilly. Mark Lavan. John Little.
and lid Von Bevern are counting on
last year‘s cxpcricnce to help them.

Cross Country’s A Haven For A Y Gang-Looking Lavan

by David Osborn

Mark Lavan is a senior and
‘ captain of the Albany State cross

country team. Yet his appearance
doesn't evoke such images of stature
and seniority. He is short with subtle
features. a bright almost beaming
complexion and choppy blonde hair.
A youthful gloss seems to coat his
entire face.

Iliese characteristics have led to
sortie humorous developments
where Lavan has served as the
unwilling yet good-Immoer focus
for squad jokes.

There was the time the team had
just won a dual meet in Rochester
last year and they stopped to eat
cnmute back to Albany. "Someone
on the team leaned over to the next .
table and asked an old man how old.
be though Mark looked." relatcdi

coach Bob Munsey. "We get a kick
out of teasing him and we wanted a
guess at his age."

Locking any presgibcd data for
his dccisiort. the elderly gentleman
gttlcd ovcr l.nvan and looked up.
"Well I can‘t say how old he is. but I
don't think he should be out this late
after dark." he ﬁnally said.

Also last year. Munsey. never one
to miss an opportunity. asked a
waitress to bring some warm milk
and cookies to Lavan in a restaurant
following the SUNYAC meet. “Here
little boy. your coach told me you
might want this." she said upon
placing the order in front of him and
fastening fl bib around his neck,

More recently. Lavan and his
mates went our for some spirits to
celebrate their second place finish in
the NCAA Qualifiers last week.

When the squad attempted to enter.
the two freshmen on the varsity,
Scott James and Bruce Shapiro.
were asked for proof of age and
not surprisingly. so was

maybe
l.nvan.

"It doesn't really bother me. it‘s
Jlihl one ‘of the things we do on the
team to keep loose." he said of the
treatment. "This is a great team and
we have several ways of keeping

loose amid all the pressure. Ranking
on my youthful look is-one. but
luckily it isn the only one."

this noun has been one of
frustrations. dismay. and since the
middle thicket of the schedule, one
of a constant rise for Albany. Lavan
has enjoyed his finest campaign and
serves as a strong catalyst from his
captain position. Tomorrow
afternoon. far off in Iowa. they‘ll

suck to cap it all off with some
surprises in the NCAA's. 3

"When you get in the nationals it's
a whole different way of running.“
l.nvan explained. “I plan to_ go out
real lust and if'you can get ctfught in
that last stream of runners. you can
stay With them while actually
running above your ability. The
nationals should be nothing but fun.
nothing btit fun."

excellent figure with an ll-2 mark
and the SUNYAC title. On an
outstanding squad. Lavan was
usually the fourth or fifth runner. He

Watts Up To Keep WCDB Heard

byThomas Martello

_ WCDB will be making a proposal
to increase its power from l0 to.I00
watts as a result of changes in
federal Communications
Commission on regulations,
according to WCDB General
Manager Dave Reisman.

WCDB. which is a non-
commercial educational FM radio
station. has to increase to I00 watts
or be in danger ofgctting bumped off
the air if a higher powered station
desired its frequency slow. according
to the new reglulations. The
regulations are scheduled to go into
effect in January. I980.

“If for some reason some bigger
station wanted the same freq ucnccy.
\H.‘ could get knocked off.“ -said
Reisman. “In order to protect
yourself. you‘ve got to raise the
power."

I he price tag for such a change in
power is estimated at $5000 to $8000,
Reisman. "About
stout) of that will he nor a for a new
cnginccring’ study. with the
remainder for equipment," said
Reismun. Reisman added that he has
contacted radio consultant Ed
I’crry. who counseled the raidio
station in its long road to the FM
dial. to begin an engineering study
for the conversion.

The power raise to I00 watts
might couase problems with
interference with Union College‘s
station. WRUC. which would also
have to raise its frequency from It)
watts. Currently both stations are
located at 90.9 on the FM idal.

" llic Untion station might move
to 89.7." said Reismun. “We can't
hoih raise and stay at the same
frequency."

WRUC general manager Dan
Roscnlcld was uanavailable for
comment last night.

WCDB executives said last night
that they would be in favor ofthis
increase in power even if the FCC
hadn't come out with these new
regulations.

Although the change would not
substantially increase the
broadcasting area of WCDB. it will
crust: the “drop-out spots" around
thc downtown campus. where the
signals are often very weak.

"We're trying to cover all of the
students 'needs." said WCDB
Station manager Paul Heneghan.
"Right now wccan‘t cover the entire
area comprising the entire student
population at SUNYA."

“ l he quality of reception varies."
Mild Reisman. “It‘s really varied even
in different rooms of my house. We
might as well serve the people."

_ ,

Vice President tor Business John Hartigan said budget Increases for
strengthening programs are usually rejected. (Photo: Karl Chan)

Reisman has informed SA
President Paul Feldman of the
situation —~ and its cost.

"Any budget request would have

to come before Central Council.",

said Feldman. “If it becomes
necessary. i wouldn‘t presume that
there would be any problem. With
the investment we‘ve made in the
sltllltm. it would be ridiculous not to
follow it up.“

Although the FCC regulations
might not overly bother WCDB. it
has been met with opposition'from
other if) wnlt stations. About Iialf of
the college stations in the country
operate on l0 watts. approximately
700 in total.

A meeting was held on Nov. 9
which brought together
representatives of radio stations
from the SUNY system.

"the consensus was against the
ICC regulations." said Reisman.

DOB Reviews New SUNY Budget

by Charles Bell

the State Division of the Budget
(DOB) is reviewing SUNY‘s final
budget request for the 1979-80 ﬁscal
year.

llic $tilif million request was
submitted tothe DOB by the SUNY
Board of Trustees on Oct. 24. It
includes $50.8.‘miilion request by
SUN YA f'orthc year beginning April
I. I979.

SUNYA -Vicc President for
ltusmcss and finance JothIurtigan
said that most of the requested
incrcasc goes toward mandatory
salary adjustments and price
ilicrca 5. Cost incrcas 5 amount to
(Ll per cent of the SUNY budget
lllL'l'L'ilt 5.

lhc remainder of SUNYA‘s
hudch rcqucst increases are
cnlcgori/cd as funds for “growth”
and "strengthening programs.“

SUNYA's budget request
indicates that the "strengthening
programs" category includes as a
inujoi expenditurctlic hiring of nine
"lnll-lmic equivalent“ faculty and
fire support positions in
departments which are “significantly
understaffed." The budget request
states that the faculty positions will
be distributed over the departments
of Psychology. Sociology.
l;conomics. Political Science.

Anthropology. Social Welfare and
Computer Science.

lhc “growth” category provides
for the hiring of one faculty position
to uccomodate a slight increase in
projected enrollment.

llie budget makes a request for
new funds to Iiirc staff for minority
and handicapped students. women‘s
athletics. the conversion of Mohawk
lower. strengthening library
holdings. and for making available
additional computer terminals and
lab equipment.

"in the past. the requests for
growth and strengthening programs
llfl\L' usually not been honored." said
Ilnrligun. “and the chances are that
this year‘s requests will not be
honored either."

DOB Deputy Director of Budget
Mark Lawton said that SUNY‘s
budget request must be “balanced
and evaluated" in relation to other
state expenditures. “we don't have
all the pieces yet. so it'sprcmature to
be making conjectures." he said.

DUB Chief Budch Examiner
i'nul Vciliettc said that Governor
llugh Carey‘s plans for a tax cut next
year writ possibly effect the SUNY
budget.

SASU Legislative Assistant Rim

Retrenchee Says Job Notiﬁcation Inadequate

hy M.J. Mernniolt

.\ former SUNYA professor.
iclrcnchcd in I970. has never
Icccncd any information regarding
next job openings at his place of
residence. Instead. accordingtoJaek
ftulloll. once a member of the
liiiision of Science and
Mathematics. all such
commtniications were placed in his
former mail box in the Chemistry
dcpnrlnicnt offices.

Notices of new vacancies iii the
SUNY system came into the
department offices for only six
months following retrenchment. the
tnnon contract requires that notices
be sent to a rctrenchce during this six
month period. Bullofl' said.

At the cod of llic six months, no
notice was sent informing him that
lctterr. rcgardingjoh openings would

be halted. Bulloffsaid. Accordingto
both SUNYA Assistant Director of
Personnel Ilcnry Man. and Vice
f’rcsidcnt for University Affairs
icivis Welch. such a letter is
normally sent to a rctrcriclied
faculty.

"lhc notices were sent out as
blanket enclosures of'opcnings in the
SUNY system." Builoff said. “They
\WIL‘ sent by inler-officcd mail. and
not a single stamp was ever used by
lltL‘ university to send tlictn. Willi
mull like that. however. there‘s no
telling if the intended person ever got
them." '

Director of Personnel Leon
t ulhnnn. said yesterday tliatletters
regarding openings are sent to
\tliatctcr address the rctrenclicd
faculty gives to his office.

"We send the letters to the address

of record. as the contract requires us
to." Calhoun said.

finlloff said. however. that he'

informed his department where to
forward lcttcrs when he left the
university. and that his permanent
address has not changed.

“ l he university has always had my
corrch address." Bulloff said. “but
I've never received any
communication at home."

litilloff also laid partial blame on
stuff changes within the Chemistry
Department which may liiive
resulted in some lost letters and
confusion. But he still questions why
thc university never sent mail
directly to his Iiornc. instead of
through his former department.

SUNYA l’residcut Vincent
t)‘l.cnry said he had adopted a policy
under which retrenchcd faculty will

he iitloruied of job openings at
SUNYA. even beyond the required
six month period. Bulloff has
received no notices of job _ ' v

for growth in academic programs."

SASU Communications
Coordinator Dennis Enwright
added that “wcdon't feel that the ﬁve
or six percent allocated for that
purpose is anywhere near enough,
and we‘d like to see about triple that
amount.”

Enwright said that the SUNY
budget includes no incoming funds
for a student health fee. indicating
that the madatory tax paid each
semester by full-time SUNY
students will be absorbed by the
state.

anright added. however. that
the budget also failed to include any
ftuids for state funding for
intercollegiate athletics.

lhc SU NY budget requests forthc
University Centers. which total $295
million. represents the largest
proportionate increase of all
SlJNY's (:9 campuses.

Ilartigun said that the
disproportionate increases for the
four University Centers is not due to
any extraordinary increase for
SUNYA. but was probablythe result
of the construction of the new
medical center at SUNY Stony
Brook.

Chief Budget Examiner Paul
Veilfcttc said that DOB will continue
to analyze the budget request
throughout tltc eiid of December,
when the Director of the Budget will
make his final recommendations to
the Governor. The ‘DOB‘s
suggestions become part of the
txccutivc budget. whichis subjectto
legislative approval in the Spring.

 

since the six month period. a fact be

attributed to both SUNYA‘s failure to
send him mail to his home. and the

possiblity that not positions the

:tdmmistrntion dccins liirii “qualified

for" have opened.

Section 35.5 of the
contract between the State
University/and the United Univcrsity
Professions (the union which
represents SUNY employees)
defines the responsibilities of the
university in regards to notifying a
i'clrencltcc of new vacancies. Bulloff
sees this clause as one which
provides a false sense of hope to the
affected faculty person.
