As a way to decrease shoplifting,
the merchandise in the Campus
Center Shirt'Shop was moved to the
l-ollett Bookstore and small items
were switched from the bookstoreto
the Shirt Shop. according to UAS
Uencral Manager E. Norbert Zahm.
lite change should also increase
efficiency and better customer
service said Bookstore Manager
Gary Dean.

Shoplifting is a signiﬁcant
problem in both the bookstore and
the Shirt Shop. according to Dean.
Although only one worker is needed
ill tlle Shirt Shopat a time. that is not
enough to prevent theft.

Lahm has said previously that the
bookstore loses 550.000 a year in
stolen goods.

' "Little stuff [in the bookstore]
disappears. and doesn‘t get paid
for." said Ltllinl. Moving tllese items

into a separate area will provide

better control in this matter. The.

"increase tllc business on the items"
since they are more readily available

In addition, by movingtllesmallcr
items such as toiletries into the Shirt

people. and placing the clothing in
the bookstore. traffic in the
bookstore can be minimiled. said

l‘hcy perished at about the same
time Shturday th‘at enraged
members of the sect attacked an
investigative group led by Rep. Leo
J. ltyan. D-Calif.. killing Ryan and
four others at a dirt air strip.

lly midaftcrnoon. soldiers
reported counting the bodies of I63
women. IJli men and 82 children. A
police spokesman said later that the
toll was 409 as the terrible task
continued at the settlement in this
small South American country
tucked below Venezuela. He said
bodies still were being found.

Also found in the fields. huts and
communal dormitories were l7
shotguns. l4 rifles. seven pistols. a
flare gun and large amounts of
ammunition. government ofﬁcials
said.

By dark. police and soldiers had
found only l2 survivors fromamong
the estimated 500-900 who had fled
into the bush.

Among the dead were Jim Jones.
founder of the People‘s Temple
settlement called Jonestown. his wife
and one of their sons. Jones. the
offspring of an interracial marriage.
and his followers. both blacks and
whites. established the inland
settlement last year. It was carved
from the jungle in an isolated region
I50 miles northeast of Georgetown
and 50 miles south of the Genezuelan
border.

“ I lley'rc going to challenge the

()rlc of the new regulations which
would llatnper SUNY stations is the

llle l-(‘C decision to phase out IO

to lessen the congestion of the

stations which would be affected
would be Unions WRUC and

He sr'iid'Jones had been shotinthe t
head and was one of the few to die
from a bullet wound. Jones' body.
clothed in black pants and a colored
casual shirt. was on a stage of the
communal meeting hall, Krautl said.

Scores of bodies were‘ packed in
the hall, a round pavilion about no
feet in diameter with a roof but no
walls. he said, and other bodies were
iri clusters outside the hall. many
with 'their arms around one another.

tiovernment investigators told
reporters that Jones apparently had
shot himself. They said most of the
dead apparently drank the fruit-
llavored water spiked with cyanide.
but it appeared some had poisen
injected iti their veins while infants
were led the deadly dose.

l'romincnt America'n‘ lawyer
Mark Lane. who was at the People's
temple camp just before the mass
deaths occurred. told reporters
today that sect members discussed
mass suicide before he lied. but that
he also heard many bursts of
automatic weapons fire from the
camp. Jonestown.

He said he heard
lounder. the Rev.
chanting over the Camp
loudspeaker, “‘Motlrerl Mothcrf
Mother! Motheri.“ seconds before
tlle gunfire erupted.

the hundreds of bodies were
loiiild by (iuyrlnesc troops who
raided the camp Sunday. Miss Field-
ftidley stlid some had gunshot
wounds but most showed nosigns of
\iolenee.

“A witness said that people in the
area were having mass suicide." she
said at a news conference. “He said

the poison was being administered to
them. that they were lining up for it}:
The poison, whose type was not .
known. reportedly was brewed in a
large vet. 1

According to Lane‘s account. the
mass deaths must have occurred an
hour or more after the Saturday “
afternoon ambush of Ryan and his
group, which had gone to the camp
to investigate reports of alleged
large-scale abuse of sect members.

“The chances of that position or
one similar to it opening within a
short time are small." Bulloﬁ' said.

The contract provides that a
retrenchce be notiﬁed of any
openings in ﬁelds similar to his or
her own for a period of six months
following their termination. It also
requires that they be notiﬁed within
a two-year period should their}
lorrner position be recreated.

Bullof'f questions whether at
university would ever recreate a
position or department within sucha
short period of time. after a
retrenchment caused by ﬁnancial
exigencies.
