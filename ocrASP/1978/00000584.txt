FIDGET FEVER

People who ftdget around ner-
voust while taking tests reportedly
get better grades. '

According to The Wall Street
Journal. University of California
Physiologist Lawrence Morehouse
has found that foot-tapping. paper-
erumbling and other manifestations
of fidgeting increase blood circula~
lion.

this increased blood flow
reportedly stimulates the brain. The
calm and motionless test-taker.
Morehouse says. misses out on this
extra stimulation.

WOMEN wonkens

'For the first time in American
history. women who work outside
the home now outnumber female
homemakers.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics
reports that as of June. 1978. 50.l
percent of all women to years or
older worked. accounting for a
female workforce of nearly 38
million. Three out of four working
women. moreover. worked full-time.

The Labor Bureau reports that the
percentage of women workers was
even ltighcr for women with families.
A record 8.2 million families were
headed by women. of which 59 per-
cent worked.

Despite this. the median income of
tltosc women-led families. College
Press Service in Denver reports. is
still far below that of two-parent
families.

CHASTE TO WASTE

Members of the American
Association of Sex educatorsI
counselors and therapists are repor-
ting that ine sexual revolution may
be comiitg to a crushing ball as more
and more Americans become “asex-
ital.“

According to Shirley Zussman,
Vice President of the association,
sonic members report that “a lack of
desire" scents to be the prime
problem with at least 50 percent of
their patients. Site said in the pastI
the most prevalent complaints were
premature ejaculation, impotence
and failure to achich orgasm.

just hitting the middle-aged and

older folks. according to Zussman.
She reports that more and more of
young people. females and males in

.their late 20‘s and early 30's, are

choosing to be asexual.

Zussman says that members of
what are now being called the
“Chastity Underground" say asex-
uality offers a comforting antidote to
such contemporary ills as traumatic
divorces or affairs. random sex and
the pressure to "score" — in bed as
well as on the job.

GUYS ’N GIRDLES

Girdles are back in fashion. at
least for men. that is.

US Magazine reports that the

latest ltalian invention poised to
sweep tltc fashion world in the USthis
winter is an undershirt with agirdle
buitiintoit.
7. MInul'iTEtured by the Bayer Com:
pany of Milan, the shirt is reportedly
tailored for beer-bellied tubbies
who‘d rather squash their extra in-
ches than lose them.

US says that amorous males can
strip down to their skivvies without
anyone knowing they are wearing
the girdle because it looks like a mere
undershirt.

The magazine reports that three-
:tnd-a-hnIf-million Italians are
currently using the girdled un-
dershirt in their daily battle against
tltc pasta and the bulge.

CYCLE CRAZE

Ten—speed bicycles may soon be
passe.

The Los Ange/es Times reports
that old-fashioned bikes. or
“clunkers.” are fast replacing the
sophisticated l0vspccd derailers on
the pedal market.

The Times says that fat balloon
tires. Texas Longhorn handlebars.
wide seats. one-speed and pedal
brakes are now the in-thing in bicy-
cle circles.

Clunkers are becoming so pop-
ular. according to The Times. that
the giant bicycle maker Schwinn is
cashing in on their popularity by
reintroducing a copy of the I932
Schwinn called the “Spitfire.”

The Times says that it clunkcr can
cost its much as $250 and that the
critic hits gone so far its to give birth
to it clunker newsletter called

SCREWED UP

In a case involving singer Phoebe
Snow‘s manager. a New York court
will decide what the word “screw”
really means.

Snow‘s manager Steven Rand
recently filed a libel suit after reading
it quote by Janis Ian in The New
York Times fan was quoted as tell-
ing The Times that Snow‘s record
company and her manager and
lawyer “all screwed her at once."

Rand complained that being ac-
cttscd of screwing someone by The
New York Times has *hurt his
reputation. In the pre-trial hearings.
it judge consulted a dictionary and
finally ruled that the Word “screw”
has "definite derogatory con-
notations.“ but is “imprecise.” The
judge siiid the final meaning of the
work in question must be decided by
another judge or by itjury.

A trial will be lteld to determine if
tltc word "screw" is libelous.

has produced some interesting
rcscttrclt.

l .

I The ' hug‘e’h'phone conglomerate
had been complaining thatsquirrels,
rats, gophers rind woodpeckerslhave
all- been chewing and pecking

telephone cables with great
enthusiasm. costing the bell system
hundreds 'of thousands of dollars an-
nually.

in efforts to combat the rodents.
Phone Company scientists came up
with a device which measures the

biting pressure of the rodent wire
eaters.

The scientists found that a squirrel
can deliver a whopping 22.000
pounds~per-square-inch bite, is
gopher 18.000 pounds-per-square-
inch, and a rat 7000 pounds-per-
square-inch.

The researchers then determined
how‘ many bites 'rodents can inﬂict
on acable in a week. They found that
gophers can produce 90.000 champs
weekly. squirrels 45.000 and rats IS;
000.

Using this information. the scien-
tists then performed simple
calculations to see which cable
sheathing material would be most
resistant to rodent bites. They found
it was stainless steel.

BREAK-INS BROKEN

Robert Shackelford, the former
head of the FBI‘s international
Security Section. has been identified
by tltc Justice Department as the
person who destroyed 47 file folders
of mttterittl relating to illegal FBI
break—ins.

The files that were reportedly
destroyed by Shttckclford bore such
titles- as “Surreptitious Entries,"
“Weatherfug (Weatherman
l‘ugitivcs Policy)“ and “Chinese
Communist Influence on the
Domestic Subversive Movement."

The destruction of the files was
made public last summer after three
former FBI executives. who are
scheduled to stand trial. requested
them for defense purposes.

Shitckclford has since retired from
his burcittt position where tltc
dcptirltttcnl ltcitdcd was known ilS
lltc “New Left Section" and lltc
“Rcvolutiouary Activities Section.“
I'hc Justice Deparlitienl says no dis-
ciplinary action will bctiikcn against
Itiiti.

'l'hc destruction of the materials
cottld result in tltc dismissal ofsome
of tlic charges against tltc former
