ingle the bizarre, the esoteric,’
and the familiar, the past and
the present. with light, color,
sound and movement, and
'you‘ve created an intoxiating
llxir. ‘

Just such a brew was concocted by the 5

i SUNYA‘s Performing Arts Center to
mnsport all who partook to a vivid world

here all color is intense and all

_“(.'elcstial Circus" swept you
mmediatcly“ into the middle of some
'trangc, futuristic ritual with the first
wirling metallic silver cape of the
ancers. The lighting was a glowing
etallic blue, the set four silver canisters,
' he atmosphere was eerie. the silence

)pprcsive. Each dancer entered slowly,

pm, and frch as tlte next entered across
the stage.

Ilic tnovcments, the silence and the
intensity seemed an alien Druidic prelude
to courtship war, or religious sacriﬁce,

the soundtrack, when it started,
l'urthcrcd this impression. lt. like the
dancc l inspired wasforcign, stylized, with
an Eastern mysteriousness: a woman‘s
voice, alternately singing, droning,
wailing, shouting, whispering, coupled
with llute, linger cymbals, hand drums and
plucking strings. The music rose.
gritltcrcd intensity, became tense, chaotic;
that suddenly serene.
suddenly. serene.

the dancers moved as the music, the
controlling force, whether captor,
ioriurer, or mystical nature instructed,
and their dance was stylized, ritual, the
telling of some unknown tale. it told of
leaf. ol isolation, of tension and chaos.
llut it also told ofcommunity, ofdtiality,
in celebration of companionship, of
coiitplcmcntartiy and support. In the end,
it too told of serenity.

llic controlled, precise, concerted
movements of the dancers, coupled with
c\ociitivc lighting and vivid, imaginative
sci and costume design and an effective
soundtrack. combined to make the long
Illlllttl dance an exercise in mood arid
ciiiotion. livcrything complemented
everything else, and created the greater

~ er,
Kathryn Komatsy, Christopher Stahl,
and a first-rate technical and production
crew. managed to pull all the strings the
medium of dance should pull.

Too often modern dance becomes so
rarefied and abstract that it becomes
more idea than practice, an interesting
intellectual construction. That's fine for
the theorists, but most people want
something to strike other chords in them
its well, to reach the physical, emotional,
and spiritual level as well as the
intellectual one iit them.

lhis, 5 by 2 Plus did.

It was a pleasure to see the music
mirrored in the movement ofthe dancers.
and to hear the movement in the music, to
have lighting, costume, and choreography
complement and expand one another
rather titan coincidentally occupy the
same stage.

lltat much traditionalism in
contemporary dance is a fresh, rather
than stagnant thing today.

"Negro Spiritunls" bounced us from
the distant. lantastic world of a StarTrek
set to the all too real and familiar world of
American slavery. l'o ti vocal soundtrack
of songs like “(lo Down Moses,"
"Crucifixion," and “Swing Low, Sweet
('liziriot," Becker‘s solo took us through
the oppression and struggle ofthe slave in
America, up to the jubilance of frcedont
with songs like “Joshua l<'it dc Battle of
Jericho“ and "(iii on Board l.i‘l Chillun."

lteckcr‘s dancing was vibrant,
evocative, and articulate. Again, the
dance was telling a story, and this story
was easy to hear. Some might not like the
idea of vocals in a modern dance
production, fciiring Broadway
inusicalcsquc contamination; to hell with
the purists because it worked, The effect is
the tliiitg, and the evening was nothing if
itot effective.

"Ladies Night Out," a hitter-sweet
portrait ol the conflict between the male
\ icw of woman and her own, was danced to
thc melancholic songs of Randy Newman
undone by the llcritlcs. The songs were of
broken male visions of love aitd
relationships, bill the polka-dot
housewife dresses the dancers worc
hinted that the dcstructivcncss was more
the necessary reaction to an oppressive
traditional role than a desire to hurt.

The 5 by 2 Plus dance company showed that modern dance could reach a
physical, emotional and splrltual level as well as an Intellectual one.

waiting on the outside, because it‘s too
risky in there, was danced to a
background ol insect chirpings and other
night sounds.

tncvitably, Christopher Stahl, who
moved about the stage white-shrouded,
menacing anti-life and anti-involvement,
was exposed by tltc two nymphettcs who
llutlcrcd and gyratcd about him through
most of the dance.

With his defensive shroud removed by
t'arol Parker and Kathryn Konatsy,
Stahl was revealed to he cladjust like them
underneath. lnstinctively he covers
ltimscll, frightened of the life, the
involvement that is being thrust upon
hint. His final gesture to the audience is
his outstretched arms: an appeal for
comfort, safety answers.

But enough of this heavy think stuff,
“Just Aitotlicr Dance" brought the
evening to a li\icly.jubiltintclose. Danced

reads. As you may have guessed, Matt
and Luisa reunite and again fall in love,
only this time they do so without
romantic illusions, resulting in a genuine
happy ending.

Rob Saloff captured the commending
attitude of the character of El Gallo. The
bandit‘s authoritative quality was
reflected by Saloff‘s deep rcsoncnt voice
and confident manner.

Marcy Kat/man was convincing as a
naive to year old in love. llcr facial

c x prcssions showed the character‘s
ciigcrncss for romiutce and happy
endings. Kat/man's voice, though

straining for low notes in thccttrlier
scenes, improved its the show progressed.

Howard Miller was it bit awkward in
his portrayal of Matt. He was
overshadowed iit times by the other
actors oti stage. Wltile singing, his
cnuneintiou was clettr, but his voice ltiid tt
nasal quality.

ALBANY STU DENT PRESS

to it passionate classical piece by Ernest
llloch, t'eminiscient of one of Bach‘s
Brandenburg Concertos, full of sawing
strings and building intensity. The dance
evoked a figure skating cxtravnganra, or
better, a three-dimensional Fantasia,
whcrc mushrooms and broomsticks
become human.

of which worc also featured in other
dances), the brightness of the music and
faces of the dancers, the concerted flying
arm and leg movements and

\‘llil'tlltcc, power, and exuberance ofcach
dancer, shouted this was pure fun, a
timid spectacle.

An electric fi nalc to an overwhelmingly
involving evening of ligltt, color,
movement and sotiiid. Without a doubt,
the best dance seen in this area in a long
tune.

The Fontostichs Live Up To Name

llucklcbcc and Belloiny, respectively)
played tltc grumbling, but well meaning
fathers to the hilt. Both have line voices
and provided muclt of the comic relief
through playing off of each other.

(iary lloffniun (Henry) and Marlene
Wilvcrs (Mortimer) showed superior
acting talents. Hoffman‘s attempted
soliloquics and Wilvcr's dying scenes
kept the audience laughing throughout
the evening.

Part of “The Ftintasticks“ clturm is that
much of the scenery is supplied by the
audience's imagination. The scenery and
props that are used are acted out by the
character of the mute, iiny handled by
Shari Hoffman.

The show was produced by the Dutch
Quad Stuff and directed by Denise
Adams.

The production of “The Fantasticks"
provided lt fiitc evening's entertainment
and well deserved the standing ovation it
received.
