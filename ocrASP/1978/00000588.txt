The loss of Royal. who ayeraged
9.5 points a game and virtually ran
the offense. was supposed to-~bc
sorrrewhat balanced by Dave
l’rzybylo. a 6‘0“ transfer from
Wichita. A local ballplayer' from
Schenectady, l’rzybylo displayed
enough playmaking skills at Linton
High School to be named an All-
Amcrican. However at thisjuncture.
llrcjunior guard has not denied the
starting ﬁve. and according to
Sattcrs. has been hurt by a prolonged
layoff from basketball.

"He‘s showing the effects of two
years of being - away from
basketball." said Sauers. "He's made
a lot ofimprovcment. but he's got a
long way to go. i thought originally
that with his background. he would
be the guy to be our point guard.
Right now he's just not ready to do
that."

For the fiftfi starting spot. Sauers
fttts selected two players who are
substnnlittfly different in their style
of play. Sophomore Ray Cesare
(0‘4") is a steady. unselfish forward
who “makes very few mistakes and
contributes iii ways that only acoach
notices." according to Sauers.
Against taller squads. it will be
Cesare that will most probably get
tfte starting nod.

Also itt coittention for a starting
position is o‘l" senior guard Bill
Bellamy. Utilizing his quickness and
fast moving style of' play. Bellamy
ttiay be iii the lineup when the Danes
lace smaller. faster teams. In that
case. Clinic will be moved to forward
and Bellamy and erklirtski will
fiatidle the guard duties.

"Bill‘s the kind of player that can
get a team going.“ commented
Sauers. “He can steal the ball two or
three times in a row — he makes a lot
of things happen.“

Rounding out what Sauers calls
"my top seven" is Kelvin Jones. the
0‘6" reserve center who could play an
integral part in a successful Albany
season. The junior is perhaps the
Drttres' finest board man. using his
215 pounds to pull down rebounds
with a great deal of authority.

“lie still has a problem with
ovcraggressivencss at times." said
Saucrs. “but I think he is playing
with a great deal more conﬁdence.
He‘s also shooting better. and lthink
the team has more conﬁdence in
firm.

"I feel the keys to our success are
Bellamy. Cesare. and Jones * how
much they can contribute. I feel with
the ability of the other four. they will
take care of themselves. But We got
to get consistent performances out
of the other three guys."

ffrere are three players on the
squad that found their way up from
first year‘s dynamic f7-2 junior
\ar'srty team. Center-forward Jim
lltttkci' (6‘5"). guard Lee Gardner
(5' Ill") and ftrrwttrd Steve Low((r'4"
coitibitre to give the Darcs' credible
bench support. Add promising
llitighttttiton transfer l’cte Slanish
rott“). who as a freshman was a late-
settsnn starter on last year's
t‘ofontaf squad. undril results in an
impressive array of talent that
Stittcrs hits ptit together.

"i lfiittk we're more experienced
this season at gttard and forward."
corntrtcntcd Cttvanaugh. “There‘s

"been a lot of improvement by each
individual player. We've got f2 guys
who can play at any time. and if we
play as it team and not as individuals.
we'll have another winning season."

Besides Royal. the other player
rtol back from last season is Kcvip
Keane. who graduated and was last
year‘s tettm captain and inspirational
leader. "We don‘t really havea Kevin
Keane-type player." said Sauers.
"We‘ll be missingthat. Kevin was a
leader and he did a lot ofthings that
didn‘t all get into the scorebook." »

laced with a 25—game schedule
that. in the opinion of Saucrs. is
"more difficult that last year's.“ the
Danes would very much like to win
ghe SUNYAC title. which includes
an automatic NCAA bid. rather
than settle for the dangerous route.
hope that they are selected for an at-
lar_ge bid. -

According to Saucrs. 1978
SUNYAC citampion Potsdam will
again be a strong club. but perhaps
the tttost talented find improved
team is Uticontu. The Red Dragons
have added b'il" transfer Jim Miller.
and could loorn as life Dancs' chief
roadblock.

“ lfrey say that he (Miller) is very
good." said Stitiers. "And if he‘s very
good. and he‘s o‘fl“. they're going to
bc a rr'u/ factor."

ffte Danes have also added a
Dirisiorr 1 school to their schedule.
Ufl January 20th. Albany will travel
to Hamilton to play the Colgate
littttcrsity squad. and Saucrs feels
"they should be tough physically.
Man to man. they'll be biggcrthan us
all tire way down the line. but we‘re

“On paper. we have a chance to go

Finale  34427_Di0tmerlr'br Danes

by David Osborn .

Shortly after SaIUrday‘s 34-27
season-ending loss to Springﬁeld
College. defensive tackle Larry
I’erirson emerged from the Albany
State football locker room and
gifted upon Rich Aufiero,
seated on a nearby bench. con-

Brad Aldrich. sullen. standing talk-
mg to a visitor.

“So we didn't win the national
championship or anything like that."

Aulicro and Aldrich. "But what
rrtore can you ask from a bunch of
guys that these two have shown. We
still have a lot of class on this team.
And those two. well that‘s class.
that‘s really class.“

With some Danes playing ﬂat and
perhaps reflectng on this season
it hit too heavily. they closed the
campaign on‘ a sorrowful note.
f'itirrlttl memories of earlier woes
and the almost lame-duck status of
tire game for Albany after missing
the playoff. enabled the Chiefs to
deny the Danes a parting fifth
straight win.

it took the record—setting
performance of Pete Watson. the

Denied of an NCAA Division 111
playoff berth in bids given out last
Sunday. the Danes still had to
prepare for Div. ll Springﬁeld in the
finale. With their hopes ofa national
title dashed. Albany lacked an
impetus for the contest and they
appeared flat until the third quarter.
llre Chief's sought to reverse last
year‘s 10-7 Dane decision.

“1 was concerned about the mental
attitude after we lost the bid." said
Albany ltead coach Bob Ford. “But
after a bad practice session on
Monday we came back and had a
llllt: week of work. Some people
weren‘t ready out there for us
ertiotionally though. and they
(Springfield) were tip.“

the Chiefs‘ ibrmidablc defensive
line was particularly up. They
constantly thwarted the Dane
Wishbone by simply never allowing
the quarterback to settle into a
groove. Monstcrback Jack Quinn
sacked Albariy quarterbacks four
times tirtd coiisistenlly confused tllc
r ttirtiitig backs by charging across the
litre and destroyitig the backfield
cohesiveness.

replied iri earnest. Chicftacklc Dave
Maga/u was steadily foresaking the

quarterback rutis or pitches. When
sophomore l'erry Walsh replaced
Aldrich tit quarterback midway
through the third period. he took
tidirtntagc of that move and utilized
lttllback Mikc Mirabella up the
iitiddl -
