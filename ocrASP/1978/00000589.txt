Looking at Albany State‘s I978-
79' basketball roster. the most
striking characteristic is in the
persort‘el that it lists. From the
seven returning players and the five
newcomers. an evaluation can be
made almost immediately — the
Danes are loaded.

"1 definitely think we should be a
contender for the SUNYAC
championship.“ sai‘d Dane
basketball coach Dick Sauers, now
in his 24th year at the helm for
Albany. "And realistically. | feel
\te'rc in contention for tlte national
charitpiottship."

"l’or anyone to stop us. they have
to put everything together." added
Dunc Cit-captain Carmelo Verdejo.
"I don't think anyone will. at least in
ottr conference."

When the Danes storm into Un-
iversity Gym on Nov. 29th for their
season opener against Southern
Connecticut. they will have retur-
ning a solid starting nucleus that has
proven ability from last year‘s squad.

. caused us great alarm. at that
rate they all would be gone. . ." It
“as after the November inventory
that security was notified of the
losses. according to both Artiofd and
llyries.

llyries said that the chairs in
question are of two types. plank and
spindle hack. the latter retailing for

approximately .‘H l9.

"Almost any commercial
furniture is this expensive these days

. the chairs are liatid rttade to
order. specifically for the Rat." said
llyries. “Many people do not rcalive
the cost of the chairs. Replacing
them creates it higher operating cost.
and this cost falls tilt the customers
tlicriiselves."

llyries feels the rittrnher of
umvatched exits iii the Rat may help
to account for the hiin number of
thefts. adding that eight bar stools.
sets of silver. and trays have been
stolen lroitt the Rat since February
itl I970.

Atiiold and llyries said tfiitt the
thefts may be occurring near closing
time on weeknights when the Rat is
less crowded and the exits aren’t
walclied.

According to Arnold. seating iii

the Rat is “substantially down“ as a
result of the thefts. “ch. business
has liecri affected by the loss of
seatitig." said Arnold. Though
stand-up business at the bar isn't

night. but especially during the day.
\\liL'll ltrneli tiiiic seating is highly

“It's a novelty to have Rat chairs

Coke sigtis front UAS vending
niacliriies.“ said Arnold. “But if
students are caught. they will be
prosecuted. One student was caught
by security it may hurt his
chances for law school.“

llyries said that the plank chairs
typically take three ntontlts to
replace. “Hopefully. we'll be able to
install the 50 chairs we ordered in
Septetiibcr during the Christmas

replacement seats have caused UAS
to "put irtto erttergericy funds."
