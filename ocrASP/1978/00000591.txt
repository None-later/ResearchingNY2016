‘O’Leary Speaks Qn'AcademiCS

'by Michele Israel
and Bob Blasenstein

S U N YA President Vincent
0‘ Leary is in favor of distribution
requrrements. but admits that
sttidents shouid‘retain some latitude
arid freedom in shaping their
education.

0' Leary. speaking at a Tuesday
tiight press conference, said that,
through talking witlt grad students
dissatisfied with the scope of their
education. lie has determined that a
well-rounded experience incollege is
vital.

‘fl believe that a person who gets a
BA lrom this university should possess
a certain amount of skills." he said.
“However. there is certainly merit to
the argument tiiat students should be
able to choose what they are to
learn.“

l he president said that the issue is
ipen to debate. and tltttt eaclt of the
various points of view would be
heard before liiial determination is
made. SUN YA dropped its
requirements two years ago, in the
lace of student protest.

lie suggested that one possible
solution would be a compromise
system. wherein students could pick
lroin a prc-detcrmined lot of
L'lllll'SL'b'.

lhc president also siiid that

student opinions of faculty members
are considered when evaluation of
prolessors take place, adding that
students play a large role in making
decisions on the Council of Continued
Appointments and Promotions.

0‘ Leary admitted that there are
problems in taking action against
unlair behavior by a professor if he
or site is tenured.

“We do not have a university wide
conststent system of evaluation.
Within the next month. we hope to
implement art evaluation site. it is
presently being discussed," he said.

l'he new withdrawal policy was
also discussed. and 0' Leary said
that many ol the problems were
caused by its late installation date
and the Speed at which it was
implemented at the ctid of last year.
Many professors were unaware of
the change. lie said.

[he new withdrawal policy iitiites
that a stiidetit can drop ti course up to
one week alter mid-semester without
icccti ing a "W". htit cannot drop the
cotirsc alter the specilied date.

Despite pressure, 0‘ Leary did not
say that prolessors sltould he
required to give at least one exam
before the date of withdrawal. but

' said "they should give appropriate‘
leed back depending on the course.

lhe president said he is not too
concerned over reports that high
school enrollment on Long island
will be dowa 25 percent by i985. as
"the university has a good reputation
tor undergraduates and' it attracts
good students.“ According to
0‘ Leary. even though Long island
residents are the major source'of
income lor the university. he feels
that the pressure will be on other
institutions and that “SUNYA will
continue to be a good draw.”

As lor his future. 0' Leary said
that next semester he will be team
teaching a graduate course‘ in
Li'innnal Justice called l’lanned
Lliange. it will study the effect of
change on community and
oigani/ational issues.

"i like working with stiidcnts.’lt‘s
\cry rewarding. i also like research;
it's litii. l‘in now in my mid 50‘s, and I
want to do everything." said
0' Leary.

"When one has tirin $20 and he

said. "he has to draw the line
somewhere. I heard that it was not
particularly useful froin a law-

“as tested two years ago."

“llic money is tltere.“ claimed
iircwington. “ll it had to be had it

L‘nrtently, the two working
