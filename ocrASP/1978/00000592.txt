TOKYO (AP) A gathering of 2,000

rebellious youths in Peking’s biggest
square broke up in disunity as the
Chinese Communist leadership
cracked down on what it called
"excessive democracy.“

At the same time. a wall poster
surfaced praising the late Chairman
Mao- l'se-tung as “a modern Lenin“
and warning that Mao‘s critics were
courting trouble.

Japanese correspondents in the
Chinese capital reported that inspite
of this. a number of other posters

‘ were'seen which resisted Senior Vice

Premier l'eng Hsiao-Ping‘s call to
halt personal attacks on Mao and
emphasize stability and unity
instead.

Washington (AP) On' a nationally
televised news conference President
Jimmy Caner said

—Americans should not
. overreact to the mass murder-suicide
in Jonestown. Guyana. ‘ by
demanding government supervision

“typical in any way of American," he
said. >

He said the victims were “people
obsessed by a particular leader's
philosophy . . . in retrospect. all of
us can deplore what did occr.”

But. he said, “I don't think we
ought to have an over-reaction
because of the J onestown tragedy by
injecting government into trying to
control people's religious beliefs."
