WASHINGTON (AP) Although
President Carter says he will
continue his fight against inﬂation
even if it costs him a second term as
president, some key government

oilicials have said he probably can‘t,

get rc-clcctcd in 1980 if he doesn't
deal with the problem.

"i would maintain the ﬁght
agaittst inllation." Carter said
lltursday when asked what he would
do it he ltad to make a choice. “i
believe it‘s exactly what the
American people want."

However. two key officials have
siiid L‘artcr‘s chances of re-clcction
probably depend on his success in
controlling inllation. which is now
stuck itt l0 percent. the worst it's
been Ill tour years.

"l’olitically. it is essential he lick
lltc prohlcrtt oi inllatiort.“ Carter's
cliicl iitllation adviser. Alfred Kahn.
said Wednesday lit a speech.

"He can‘t get re-clccted unless ltc
deals with inﬂation, and therefore lie
has to be serious." Chairman 0.
William Miller of the Federal
Itcscrvc lloard told it congressional
coinittttlcc recently.

llotli Kalin and Miller were
appointed to their posts by Carter.

unemployment above the current 5.8
percent of the labor force — but
rcpcatcd earlier assurances that a
serious economic down-turn is
unlikely.

"We don‘t anticipate a recession
or depression next year." he said.

A large number of prominent
private economists have said

Carter‘s anti-inflation program
virtually guarantees a recession in
1979. But administration economists
had maintained until very recently
that the economy should grow at a

minimum of about 3 percent, and '

possibly higher, with little impact on'
unemployment. It

l'hc economy hastbeen growing at
a rate of 3.75 percent so far in l978.
the administration argues that
slower economic growth is needed
next year to take pressure all prices.
which have more than doubled in the

' past It years.

“i think 'we will be successful in
leveling off-the rate of inﬂation ind
then in bringing it down,” Carter
said. ' '

Carter also said he has not agreed
to any changes in his voluntary wage
and price guidelines — 7 percent for
wages and an average of 5.75 percent
for prices. But he added: “With a
thousand different decisions to be
made. there will be some ﬂexibility."

the ﬁnal details of the guidelines
aren‘t yet worked out, Caner said.

industrial production will decline.
says the gloomy forecast. But in
October it rose to ait all-time high.

lltc slow weakening of the
ccoitonty is bound to appear in
surveys ol purchasing agents. Or so
lltc lorccasts indicate. But one recent
survey found the economy
“piiritping iron." and “putting on
more muscle."

Another released this week by the
National Association of Purchasing
Management. suggested that
recession tears were exaggerated.
