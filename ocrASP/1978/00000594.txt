Baby Barriers

A Stanford University professor
who recently returned from a tour of
China. says that in that nation of
some ,910 million people, birth
control is a must for most women.

Professor Ev Rogers says that in
rural China. each commune decides
the number of births that can be
permitted during a certain period. -

Potential parents. he says. are
basically chosen for their party
standing. their age, health, and
desirability socially.

the professor reports that most
people in communes are required to
wait until they are 25 before
marrying, and that pre-marital sex.
and even hand-holding outside of
marriage, is rare.

As a result. newlyweds are usually
allowed to have a baby soon after
marriage, but they are then required
to wait at least another ﬁve years or
so' before they can have another
child.

Alter the second child. Rogers
says, one partner is then sterilized so
that no more hirtlis can occur.

Roger says that reminding women
to use contraception is apparently a
community effort. At one commune,
a public address system booms out
pep talks to the workers in the fields
and regularly asks the women.
"Have you taken your pill today?“

' Moody Cures

lhc next time you‘re feeling sick,__
maybe you should pay a call to your
neighborhood “ Mirth Center.".

Medical researcher Doctor
Ri‘iymond Moody has developed
plans for a proposed laughter center
in Staunton, Virginia that would
utilize non-stop jokes and other
Iorms of humor to treat illnesses.

Doctor Moody says that a series
of medical studies has found that a
good. old-fashioned belly laugh can
cure all kinds of physical ailments
lrom headaches to infections to
Insomnia. No one really knows why.
Moody says. but laughter works.

lhc Mirth Center, according to
Moody. might feature such things as
lunhouse mirrors that distort your
reflection. a film room playing old
comedy movies. speakers
broadcasting a steady stream of
Jokes. funny toys and ti room ﬁlled
\vilh era/.y furniture.

Alarming News
If you‘re one those people who
can‘t seem to get up in the morning.
Richard Senac may be the man to
listen lo.

and air

 

Senac‘s company. Roosters

Incorporated. specializes in what
you might call “alarming results“ for
its customers. The New Orleans-
hased firm will try just about
anything to shake heavy sleepers out
of the sack. Some of the company‘s
most effective sounds» include an
oceanlincr‘s whistle. a subway train
roaring through a station and a 2I-
gun salute.

Customers can even suggest their

reveille.

- own alarming noises. One woman
requested her own barking dogs. Ex-
military men often request a bugler
sounding
players have put their money on a
trumpeter playing post time.

One very deep sleeper insisted on

the ultimate treatment, a recording
of his wife yelling for him to get our
of bed. It worked.

Down With Frowns

lliere‘s legislation against water

pollution
Michigan psychologist is proposing
that there should also be laws against
“li'own pollution."

and now a

l’rolessor James McConnell of

ilic University at Michigan thinks

 

  

irowns should be forbidden
everywhere. because “frowns are a
type of psycho-pollution that is as:
deadly as smoke fumes or mercury in
drinking water."

I McConnell reports that more than
80 percent of delinquent children
come from homes in which the
parents are what he calls “punitive
lrowners."

lhc disgruntled. yet smiling
professor says. in order to
encourange better mental health and

‘less crime. “maybe we ought to

legislate for more smiling. One can
loll the spirit more easily than the
hotly.“ McConnell says.

llletters

A specialist in the field of
IIletterology“ suggests that the
spelling of your last name. may
determine which illngsses you'll get.

lzlliot l'eplitz of the Letterology
Institute in Hollywood. California
says he has received signed
statements from practicing
physicians who have found it
connection between.a person's last
name and the diseases he or she is
likely to contract.

Reading Leaders

Here's a quick quiz: _ What
national magazine is the biggest
seller among the US senators.
representatives and their staff
members who shop at the Con—
gressional newsstand in the Capitol
Building? .

Is it a heavy business publication
such as Forbes or Business Week? Or
perhaps a news magazine such as
Time. Newsweek. or US News?

The correct answer is none of
these. The top-selling magazine on
Capitol Hill is Penllioure.

Leukemia Links

A health professor at the
University of Utah is urging the
American government to try to
locate and study former residents of
\iIIIlIlL'l'll Utah who lived in lhc area
as children between I95I and I962.

Doctor Robert l’endleton says
newly—accumulated evidence
indicates iliai these people may run
extremely Iiiin risks ol'contrticting
leukemia and other forms of fatal
cancer.

I he doctor reports that duringthe
ll-and-a-Iialf-ycar period in
question. at least 84 atomic bombs
were exploded in nearby Nevada.

He says that recent studies have
found that some nfthe Utah children
apparently were exposed to levels of
radiation 40 times higher than those
which have triggered leukemia in US
servicemen assigned to the test area.

Doctor I’endleton says that one
scrviceniaii recently died from
leukemia after being exposed to less
than a two-rad dose of radiation
lollowing an atomic test. He
calculates that some of the
unaccounted-for children were
exposed to levels of 80 rads
Iollowing the Nevada atomic test on
May l‘)tli, I953.

Professor l’cndleton says that the
government. at least solar, has
shown no interest at all in helping to
track down the exposed people. He
says. in his words. “I ihiiik tltcrc has
been a lear of the government having
to assume some financial
responsibility for victims of
radiation il' a study should poittt up
health effects.“

3-D TV
A Dutch electronics firm claims it
is working on what it calls “the

biggest television breakthrough
since color sets."
The N.V. Philips Company

reports it is developing a three-
dimensional TV set. The Company
says the set being designed would not
require those special J—D glasses
which are necessary for three-
dimcnsional movies and comic
books.

Philips claims it is still in the
“research stage." but that it has
already produced 3-D pictures
that suffer from what it calls “fuz-
rincss."

The British business publication
The Economist says that Philips
seems to be far ahead of its Japanese
competitors in ii race to develop
.i-l) TV. and estimates that a
Philips set may be on the market by
- Will.
