he causes are numerous. One
quad party too many, one too

'it‘s the nights when about
eight different stereos start
blasting at once and you've got a chem
test the next day. .
But for whatever reason, a lot ofpeople
do» it; they move off campus. And for
better or worse, the change is immediate.
Front the once friendly but cramped
confines of the dorms, students make the
big move in big numbers. They“getof ."
l'he confines may not be any less
cratnped, however. The size and variety
of off-campus dwellings that students
occupy in Albany vary as much as the
hamburgers in quad dining halls. One
may be cold and dry, another hot and
greasy. llut spiced with tile right
ingredients, an aparttnent cart be a great
place to live.

l'he kitchen has a gas stove that
probably was built around the time

Cooking is an adventure, to saythe least.

 

 

lltc highlight of many abodes is often
the furniture, though. That is, if the
apartment happens tv be one of the

 

 

exclusive pads classified as “furnished.”

love the couch that's provided. The nice

tome oil-campus for two SUNYA
students.

"John. have you ever seen a bug like
this one bcl'or‘c'.’ It’s kind of big for your
average roach, isn't it?“

“i think i saw one like it once in my
salad when yvc lived on Indian, but it
wasn‘t that big for sure. Do you think we
should tell the landlord before we get
everything settled in?“

“I don‘t know, he did say the

it's just a leftover one from the last time

that certain jc ne sais quoi.
It is a life though, and to many it‘s
much more liveable than the dorms.

“Yea, i guess that would explain the
other four that are‘ heading for that piece
of bread in the corner, and the little troop

 

 

that‘s camping out over by the
t'clrigcrator."

“1 )id you notice that little pool of water
In the bathroom? it wasn't there when We
looked at tile place last May, was it?"

“No, but I do remember sceinga rather
large bucket sitting in the middle of the
floor. Do you think it had anything to do
with if!"

"Come to think of it, it did have a fair
amount of water in it. But they said it was
left over from a keg they had the week
before. You cart still smell the beer in the
carpet.“

“Year. 1 guess you're right. Let‘s go get

Commented one junior off-campusite
from Wantagh, “Off-campus life is like
home without your parents. It‘s a real

 

 

 

 

pisser at first, but when the dishes start
piling up it can be a drag. it is better than
the dorms, though, but I guess that isn't

 

saying much.“
l'he duties and little jobs involved in
living in an apartment do tend to annoy

 

some students. For the first time, they're
living in a house with no mom to clean up,
and where food money has to come out of
their own pockets. 7

 

A St. James senior summed it up.
“When i was home for Thanksgiving, i
realized how nice it was to come in after

 

 

being out at night, and just open the
rcfrigcratorto find it full ofgood food. To
be able tofix a snack and not worry about

 

cleaning up the dishes was nice. I guess
uowl knowjust how much responsibility
living off—campus is.“

 

 

A responsibility yes. A pain at times
yes. llut overall, rnost reactions tothe
"big move" are positive. It‘s a little more

 

work, a little more bother, but it's also a
quieter, more private life. It‘s a way to get
away from the concrete towers for a

 

 

 

halls and cramped suite rooms.
