Grateful Dead
“Shakedown Street”

he Grateful Dcad‘s rise to
sifperstardom has been pretty
amazing considering the fact
that they‘ve never had the
benefit of hit singles and six-
digit album sales. They represent a
different kind of musical ideal; unlike
groups like Jefferson Starship, they
'haven‘t abandoned the styles which made
tltent great irt order to attain commercial
success.

ScottSnyder

I‘ve never been a “Dead-head“ and the
new release will probably not make me
one either, although it does bring me a
step closer to such notoriety. Although
the album is not as adventurous as the
Dcad‘s last release. “Terrapin Station", it
does maintain a level of excellance.
"Shakedown Street's“ main objective, it
seems, is to get some good ‘01 time music
down. At no point is the record dull and
boring; in a sense, the Dead have never
been more alive.

 

Mason LAKE 0 PM a

Emerson, Lake & Palmer
“Love Beach”
merson, Lake and Palmer
have just released a new album
amid strong rumours of a
break-up. and strangely
enough,'the record is titled
Love Beach. It is asimple package; there
are no lyrics enclosed, and there is no
inner sleeve. In fact, the only picture of
the trio features them in an ebullient
mood on the cover, decked out in the
latest disco fashions, posing on the sands
that presumably inspired the title.

 

Jay Gissen

It is not their best album, but inlight of
bad reviews for both volumes of their
Works, empty seats in an ill-fated, overly
large tour, financial hassles, and
unfounded, exploited rumours of an
unfriendly break-up, the group has
responded with a confident, positive
release, provingto fans and foes alike that
lil,.l’ is still one of the foremost groups on
the music scene today.

The Greg Lake songs are mostly up-
tempo love sortgs, with lyrics supplied by
past collaborator Peter Sinfield.

 

 

 

His music is simple. The tunes are

 
 
   

recordings

    

“Good Lovin” starts out the set and
although it’s a remake, it's one of the

album‘s prime cuts (much in the same way '

“Dancing In The Streets” graced the last
album). Bob Weir's vocals are gritty and
the whole production is sharp. ’

"France" fronts the vocal talents of
Donna Godchaux and Weir in a bouncy
semi-reggae number.

The title track has the feel of a Grateful
Dead classic with Jerry Garcia on the lead
vocals chores but ‘the semi—disco beat
offsets its performance. “Serengetti” and

.DEGEMBERT,

   

 

“Fire On The Mountain" follow; the first
being a neat percussion instrumental and
the second another Garcia outing(not to
be confused with the Charlie
Danicl‘s/ Marshall Tucker song of the
same name) which comes across as the
closest thing to a traditional “Dead”
number.

The sccong side is similar in style to the
first. “I Need A Miracle", fronted by Bob
Weir is a funjiving tune. The momentum
is broken-up a little by “From The Heart
Of Me“, Donna Godehaux's solo ballad.
“Stagger Lee", sung by Garcia (not a
remake of the real old "Stagger Lee"), and

"All New Minglcwood Blues“, fronting

Weir, continue the jiving good-times
party flavor of the album.

“Shakedown Street" is not a
rcvolutiortary album by any means; it
represents the continuing refinement of
tltc Grateful Dead without pulling any
unnessessary punches. It‘s a fun album
that can be taken lightly, being mellow
and rowdy at the same time. There are
moments where it is definitely
commercial althouglt it really doesn't try
to be. Taken on the whole, “Shakedown
Street“ is definitely the place to be if you
want some good, fun music.

catchy and fast, and rely on a standard
rock format of ‘vcrse chorus, verse
chorus, etc.‘ as opposed to the many
changes some past ELP songs have gone
through.

The Keith Emerson contributions, on
the other hand are musically, very varied
whilc revolving around a singular lyrical
theme, the “Memoirs of an Ofﬁcer and A
Gentleman." Emerson's keyboards are
less daring and less frenzied, but sound
wonderful in their regimentation. He
never misses a note.

Although Carl Palmer didn‘t write a
thing for the album, his drumming is
superb. ' '

What makes the album shine is the
glorious singing of Greg Lake, delivering
his best vocal performance of just about
every ELP record. He's brash, emotional,
smooth, and exciting in his singing, even
in those quieter moments when his voice
tackles a more serene song.

The best of the Lake tracks are the title
track' and the stunning song called “For
You“. The latter is a definitive ballad
along the lines of “C‘est la vie", and the
former is an upotcmpo rock and roll
number, with enough raw power to make
it as a hit.

As far as the [Emerson side two suite,
the “Memoirs of an Officer and a
Gentleman“ the best part is the first
section, called “The Education of a
Gentleman". This wltolc suite is more
nccgssihle than the “Piano Concerto No.
l“ was, but is, of course, a group effort
with the voice of Greg Lake aiding its
appeal.

I never thought ELI’ would lead me to
a place called Love Beach, but with the
great skill they possess as musicians and
performers, tltc trip turned into a most
pleasant, as well as surprising journey.

$1,376,000, and this was its ﬁrst week on

The advertising campaign ofthis movie
cart take much of the credit for the long
lines at the box office. In print, there has
been a basic campaign of a portion of

which accompanies it. But it is the

comparable to that of a classic horror

caliber as another one of Mr. (ioldman's

All this aside, "Magic" evolves into a
