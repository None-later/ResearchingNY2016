THEFACTS:

HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN

use ENCARE ovm:

Encare Oval ‘“ was introduced to Ameri-
can doctors in November 1977. Almost
immediately, it attracted widespread phy-
sician and patient attention.

Today. Encare Oval is being used by
hundreds of thousands of women, and
users surveyed report overwhelming sat-
isfaction. Women using Encare Oval say
they lind it an answer to their problems
with the pill, IUD's. diaphragms. and aero-
sol foams.

EFFECTIVENESS

ESTABLISHED IN
CLINICAL TESTS.

Enc'are Oval‘“ was subjected to one of the
most rigorous tests ever conducted for a
vaginal contraceptive. Results were
excellent—showing that Encare Oval
provides consi§tent and extremely high
sperm-killing protection. This recent us.
report supports earlier studies in Euro-
pean laboratories and clinics.

Each Encare Oval insert contains a pre-
cise. premeasured dose oi the potent.
sperm-killing agent nonoxynol 9. Once
properly inserted, Encare Oval melts and
gently eliervesces, dispersing the sperm-
killlng agent within the vagina,

The success of any contraceptive
method depends on consistent and
accurate use. Encare Oval ‘“ is so conve-
nient you won‘t be tempted to forget it.
And so simple to insert, it's hard to make
a mistake.

it pregnancy poses a special risk for you.
your contraceptive method should be se—
lected after consultation with your doctor.

Most people find Encare Oval com.
pleter satisfactory. In a limited number
ol cases. however. burning or irritation
has been experienced by either or both
partners. it this occurs, use should be

discontinued.
4 EASIER TO INSERT
THAN A TAMPON.

The Encare Oval" is smooth and small. so
it inserts quickly and easily—without an
applicator. There‘s none oi the bother of
aerosol foams and diaphragms. No
device inside you. No pill to remember
every day. Simply use as directed when
you need protection.

You can buy Encare Oval whenever you
need ii...it's available without a prescrip-
tion. And each Encare Oval is individ-
ually wrapped to III discreetly into your
pocket or purse.

BECAUSE ENCARE OVAL

IS INSERTED IN ADVANCE,
IT WON'T INTERRUPT

The hormonelree Encare Oval. Safer for

"Hpr “us get the message across to
Giants‘ owner Wellington Mara. Let
liitn know that he'll soon have an
empty stadium if he can‘t produce a
winner.”

New York fans have been in an
uproar since the Giants fumbled
away their Nov. l9 game against the
Philadelphia Eagles. The Giants had
the ball and a l7-12 lead with less
than 30 seconds to play. but instead
of running out the clock by sitting on
the ball. quarterback Joe Posarcik
attempted a handoff to Larry
Csonka. The connection was never
made and Philadelphia's Hcrm
Edwards picked up the loose ball
ttnd scootcd 26 yards for the winning
touchdown. ‘

Wltich opened the ﬂoodgate for
criticism. One newspaper ran a
telephone poll asking where the
blame for the play should be placed.
Coach John McVay easily
uutdistanccd Pisarcik and offensive
coordinator Bob Gibson, who sent
in the play from the press box.

the Giants players have not taken
tltc criticism lightly. Defensive end
.liick Gregory blames the press for
