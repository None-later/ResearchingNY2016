Weekend Highlights
' .WreStling Thamey' &
- Danes vs. Cortland

 

by David Osborn

the men's varsity basketball learn
0:5 for its second straight win
Saturday night against Cortland and
University Gym will be the site of the
Adirondack Wrestling Classic
earlier in the day to highlight a full
'ychedulc of Albany State sports this
weekend. . .

Coming off their opening game
71-60 victory over So. Conn.
Wednesday night, the Danes face the
Red Dragons in the ﬁrst SUNYAC
basketball contest for both squads.
tiamclime at University Gym will be
3:30 pm. as the Danes begin the long
trail of conference games that carries
them into late February and an
automatic NCAA bid if they should
emerge as conference champions.

I972 Olympic gold-medalist Dan
table leads his defending NCAA
champion Iowa St. wrestlers into the

Iavorcd slot at the tourney scheduled
lor 12:30 pm. The Orangemen of
Syracuse face Iowa St. in the
opening round while the host Danes
meet Worcester Polytechnic
Institute. Albany will then face
Syracuse and they will manage to
avoid Iowa St. completely.

Syracuse linishcd llth in last
year's NCAA‘s so there is achallenge
at least. Iowa St. is led by their All-
American l90-pound wrestler Bud
Palmer. and they feature several men
who placed third or higher in the
nationals and keyed the title. Gable,
who Iias retired now but held a
phenomenal lBl-l lifetime record
was a graduate of Iowa St. and took
his gold medal at Munich.

Albany will Itavc their initial
seasonal showing in the quadrangle.
llicy are led by co-captain Rick
l’ortcr who wrestles iit I58 and

boasts a I7-,7 record from last year
and a fourth-place showing in the
SU NYAC's. Dane coach Jde Garcia
calls the squad. “a lot stronger than
last year." and emphasizes the youth
look on the team. Pete Toporowski.
at I42. may be the standout in the
lrosh pool. Last year he was his area
high school champ and placed sixth
Ill the Junior World'Tournament.
Albany's two swimming teams
head up northward to McGill
University in Montreal to compete
in the McGill Invitational this

breast stroke event and may really 7

begin to roll when Joe Aherm a
transfer from Niagara University, is
eligible on Jan. I.

For the women, l6 entrants will
take the bus ride across the border,
and coach Deb Fitzdam says their
strongest shot at recording good
showings will probably come in
either the 400 or 800<yard free
events. But they may be hampered
by the generally longerdistan'oes the
Canadian'schools compete at. In
Canada. students are allowed ﬁve

Weekend. For both teams. it will be ' years of athletic eligibility so both

their first attempt at the meet. and
lor the men it will be a vendetta of
sorts up in Canada. McGiII copped
second place in the Great Dane
Relays behind Coast Guard while
' the hosts were relegated to the Fourth
spot. For the women‘s team. it will
mark their first Invitational of the
)car alter openihg up strongly with
two dual-meet victories.
llic triumphant breast stroke
relay team of Joc Shore, Frank
IIL‘IL‘I' and Steve Rehfuss at the
Relays seems to be the nucleus ofthe

“Pimento--

TEicpensiveRose-

COLUMBUS, _ OHIO (AP). More
than l00 expensive thoroughbred
horses romped in nearby ﬁelds on
the majestic 4.240 acres that make up

_John and Dan Galbreath's Darby
Dan Farm.

But on this cold Ohio dav the
subject was baseball. specifically,
the wooing of celebrated free agent
Pete Rose into the already potent
lineup of the Galbreaths‘ Pittsburgh.

- I’irates. ' ‘

Dan Ualbreath. the club's
president. said Wednesday he did
not talk money in trying to land the
[6-year Cincinatti Reds great for
Pittsburgh. where the Pirates'v
attendance sagged to‘964.000 in
I978. '

“It sounds exciting." said the
leading switch-hitter of all-time. “I'd‘.
be sort of a pioneer. getting the
Pirates baseball fans turned on
agains.“

Rose concedes he's now adding
the Photos to his list of top
candidates after Iunching with the
Galbrcaths and touring their farm.

"I know they weren't on my
original list." Rose said. “but after
talking to the Galbreaths. I have to
change my mind. They are definitely
ati offensive team. which I love."

Rose and his iiiciit, Cincinnati
lawyer Reui'cn Katz, flew to
Philadelphia for negotiations with
the lavorcd l’hillies today. and a
I‘l'ldlly trip to talk to the New York
Mcts was a distinct possibility.

Rose. ninth on baseball‘s all-time
hit list 3,l64. sees no way Itc will meet
his sell-imposed signing deadline of
l ucsday. ahead of the game‘s winter
meetings in Orlando. Fla. t

“It‘s ttmaling how all that work.
dedication and sliding head first is
paying off.“ he said as the big money
ollcrs llowcd his way. “It‘s like going
up a mountain. I'm halfway up and
still going."

tialhrcath, sitting next ot Rose at
a nch conference, intcrjccted. “l’ctc
says he's climbing that mountain.
Well. we Iccl he reached a peak
today." _

Rose and Kill]. talked contract
wtili the Atlanta Braves Monday
and the Kansas "ity Royals and St.
Louis Cardinals liicsday in their
whirlwind tour.

"I'iii obligated to tall; to all the
people who dialled me." said the
man who holds seven Reds career
halting records. "I don't want totalk
to them on the telephone. I want to
meet them l'acc—to-l’acc."

tialhreath did iiol miss the
opportunity for a public plug for the
Pirates. saying. “I think our Club is
uniquely ﬂexible to handle a I’etc
Rose-type talent. Ho ctiii turn our
club and our fans on."
