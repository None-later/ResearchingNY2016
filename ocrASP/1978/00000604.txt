nuns Kr.st That Everyone
 Will Be Gearing For Them

NEW YORK (AP) The No. 1'
ranking in college basketball can be
like holding a double-edged sword
— one slip and you out yourself.
Duke coach Bill Foster is painfully
aware of that position.

“l'm really proud," says the coach
of— the nations‘s top-ranked team.
"but on the other hand. everyone will
be shootingfor’us this year. That No.
1 ranking will give a lot of teams
incentive to beat us this season.“

Foster‘s Blue Devils find
themselves in precisely the same spot
that Kentucky was.in last season.
The Wildcats were ranked No. l at
the start of the year and had to prove
themselves from the beginning. They
did 7- with some difﬁculty — before

winning the NCAA championship
by beating this same Duke team in
the_ ﬁnals.

“We have no room for slipping,“
said Foster. “so it's not going to be
easy. especially with the schedule we
play this year. i think. like any other

team. we‘ll be all right if we stay '

away from injuries.

“But, honestly. our schedule is so
tough that we can‘t afford to play
any game with one of our starters
obi. Usually. there are a few games
during the season when you can get
away with less than your full
complement of players. Not this
year. though.“

an unlucky streak in the upcoming
months with her varsity
synchronized swimming team. “We
'cxpect to do really well. i hope l'm
not disappointed." said Rogers. “We

building and now we're good. We
have a lot of depth spread

newcomer to the squad and feels the
talent is there but more practice is
needed. “We have a lot of talent, as
long as we work together we will
have no problem havinga successful
season.“ said Martinez, who had not
played basketball for Albany in the
past due to playing volleyball and a
broken shoulder which she suffered
last season.

llill hopes that the recent elections
of co—captains will be a big lift for a
present lack of enthusiasm on the
team. “Unity and spirit is really
lacking; it may hurt us in the early
portion of the season." said Hill.
"We have five games in December.
but I look to the team leaders to
bring the team together more in the

synchronized swimming first
sparked at Bethlehem Central High
School in Delmar where she was on
