Verdejo, Cesare Stand Out!

As Albany Outlasts So. Conn.

by Rich Sellgson

After 42 days of practice and one
scrimmage. the Albany State varsity
basketball team ﬁnally played for
sortie marbles Wednesday night.
And when the game at University
Liym ended, the Danes settled for a
7l-bU unartistic opening victory over
the Southern Connecticut Owls.

ltiferit shortage on the Owls' club.
whose record f'gL to 0-2. a 23-22
Albany halftime advtintage was
untnipressive. In the second half.

made some defensive adjustments
atid his rejuvenated club wore down
a spirtrky Owls' team.

"We pltiyed a very poor game."
said batters. “We cottld have pltiyed
that good after a week of practice.
We‘ll do better the next time."

the time was right for the Danes'

etitered its the game‘s initial reserve
after less than five minutes of'trctiori.
"i on have to think tnore offensively

Firearms Proposal Tabled By Univ. Senate

by Pat Francomiino

A proposal that University Police
Ufficers on daytime motor patrol be
allowed to carry and use firearms
was sent brick to committee by the
University Senate yesterday.

Vice President for l‘iniince and
llustiiess John lltlrtigiin. said that.he
tell that there was not enough
rationale provided at the moment
natti to come to it decision.

Aeeorditig to student senator
Mark liol‘kowski. l‘lartigan‘s
inorion conic its a “pleasant Surprise"
to other strident senators who feared
that the bill would be railrtiaded
through the Senate.

the motives beliiird the bill. was
explained by University Police
Director Jim Williams. Williams
said that the recommendation came
from the University Community

Council (UCC) which was
established one and it half years ago
to evaluate the current arms policy
etitrcted at that time; authorized the
carrying of gtriis on the afternoon
and midnight shifts. the new
proposal wotild permit "one to two
officers" in cars to carry guns during
rtte day shift.

Williams. who said that he was
surprised by the bill being put on
the floor at this tiriie. claintcd tlirit
dtic to the luck til background
pi esetited he felt that sending it brick
in committee ‘ . the lesser of‘two
crils." when compared to killing it.

Although he admitted that the
rtiajortt) of the problems occur
dttrilig the afternoon and midnight
sitilts. he said he was concerned
about three riiatri depositories on
campus which could be to danger of
being held rip tinder gtitipoiiit. they
include the lirtrsar‘s Office. the
ltookstorc. atrrl check cashing. 'l‘hese
tttiec. said Williams may litild
.ltl)\\ltt.‘tt: tip to Sltlfl.tl(ltl each day.

\\i|liams spurred the alternative
proposal in call iii iit'tiied Albany
police officers. who in his opinion
are not its well trained in the use of
firearms iii addition to being
insensitive to a university sitirtition
He also said that the UCC
sitbcotitriiittce report stated tlittf
there was no evrdeiice of the misuse
of firearms and that in the event of a
"questionable situation“ the
ltllt\‘ttf'Slly would litivc no recourse
of action if the Albany police were
Ilt\tliVL'd.

 

tiniverstt‘y Senator. Professor
t'etcr lteriedicl. supported the bill by
\tl)lllg that he left just the presence
of .Il'lltc‘d police would be a dctcrent.
\tlreieas their abscerice would be an
“H ttattoii. to those considering any
type of crime.

Professor Charles larltori took
issue with the proposal. llis concern
stemmed from the fact that the time
during which the officers would be
catiyttig firearms would be when
the University is most densely
populated.

larltori said that the bill
demanded a great deal of
consideration. “a lot more titan it
appeared that if was going to." He
also said that he was quite happy
“till the otttcotiie fit that it would
atlow.lor an opportunity to look at
the litll ltltlt't.‘ closely.

ltri‘ltori also expressed concern
otcr what he cttlled a "great
likltliood" of an ttcctdeiit occurng is
officers “etc to carry grins.

ltiitkouskt said later tlitit ilie
strident senators would "spend the
|tL'.\l tiiontli analyzingtlicstltitttiori."
He did say that it was important to
keep as few grins oti campus its
possible

SA President ’trttl i‘itidltttltl
stated that he did not think that the
officers on the shift in question
should be permitted to carry gtltis
because during tltttt little “they coriie
