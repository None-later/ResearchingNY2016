Army Stifles Sex Fraternization

WASHINGTON (AP) The Army
lnis ordered a crackdown on sexual
lraterni/tition between male and
leiiiale soldiers of different rank
because of "an increasing number of
incidents of inappropriate
relationships.“

llie move follows a study that
reported a “creeping advance of sex
li‘atcrni/ation throughout the
Ainiy" and said man-woman

headquarters last month sent out It
message instructing all commanders
to “counsel those involved or take
other acttoii as appropriate" in cases
ol relationships which can
"reasonably be expected to
undermine discipline, authority or
morale."

lhc directive said commanders
slioitld act "Il relationships between
service members of different rank
cause actual or perceived parlialily
or unlaiincss. involve the improper
use of rank or position for personal
gain" or are otherwise detrimental
"to good order and discipline." ‘

there was no indication in the
message of what would constitute

"appropriate" action. One Army
source. who asked not to be
Identified. said that “it‘s been

dropped in the lap of the
commanders." ’

   

Army ollicials said they have no
statistics available that would bear
out the message's reference to an
increasing number of“inappropriatc
relationships."

l here was no public
announcement of the new Army
order. llie other services have issued
nothing similar.

Ihe message on “Iclationsltips
among supeiiors and subordinates"
makes no specific reference to sex.
but Army officials confirmed the
new order grows otit of the many-
laeeled study that evaluated the
impact ol women in the Army.
