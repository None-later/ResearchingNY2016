American League Proposes

Three Division Structure

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) The
American League is expected to
support a three-division plan and
triple-tiered playoff system to be
presented at baseball's winter
meetings later this week.

But some National League clubs
are opposed to the revolutionary
proposal advanced by a l0-man
reorganization committee.

A source close to baseball told The
Associated l’ressthal the committee.
uppointed by baseball
L ommissioncr Bowie Kuhn. believes
the move is the answer to the game's
liniincial dilemma. Evar increasing
player salaries. tlic multimillion-
dollrir free agent market and inﬂated
operating costs have forced the game
to look for greater revenues.

the committee believes the three-
dnistiintil setup will create closer
competition and thus more season-
loiig interest by the fans similar to
iooihiiil. basketball and hockct.

the new playoff system also
would develop richer television
packages lrom the major networks.
Ihc program would include the
time division champions and a wild
card entry -- the team with the
iotirth best record. .

Ilrc cointiitllcc is scheduled to

make its report Thursday, and the
National League objections
\iould evaporate if the findings
strongly indicate the plan is in the
best interest of the game.

if the plan should be adopted.
according to the source, here is what
the divisional breakdown would
look like: AMERICAN LEAGUE:

East — New York. Boston.
liiiltirnorc and lororito. CENTRAL
- llctroit. Cleveland. Chicago or
Milwaukee. and Kansas City.
WEST — California. Seattle.
Minnesota. Milwaukee or Chicago
and lcxtis. NATIONAL LEAGUE:

EAST — Philadelphia. New
\ork. Montreal and Pittsburgh.
CENTRAL — Cincinnati. Chicago.
St. Louis and Atlanta, WEST -— Los

\iigclcs. Stilt l‘rililClSL‘l). San Diego.
and Houston.

The cure to“;

college blahs.
it

It's a feeling that slowly descends upon
you. The exams, the pop tests. the required
reading, the hours at the library, the thesis~—

they won't go away.

But you can. This weekend. take off, say
hello to your friends. see the sights, have a
great time. You'll arrive with money in your
pocket because your Greyhound trip doesn't

. take that much out of it.

If you're feeling tired, depressed and
exhausted, grab a Greyhound and split. it's a

sure cure for the blahs.

the opponents of the plan claim
that with fewer teams in the
lll\'|§l0n§, there is a greater chance
tor an early runaway. leaving the
, oilicrs hopelessly out of contention
and destroying rather than
increasing fan interest.

ihc opposition also is concerned
that interior teams might wind up
playing in the World Series. For

'cxumplc. if the two wild card teams -

reached the Series. the fourth-best
teams in each league would be
playing each other.

Penn State, A‘ldbMa:

A Chance For Number One

NEW YORK (AP) For the first time
since l97l. college football has a
post-season shootout between the
No. l and 2 teams. Whether it really
will decide the national
championship remains to berseen.

Top-rated Penn State. the nation's
only unbeaten team, will meet
runner-up Alabama in the Supr'
Bowl on New Year's Day. And. said
Bama quarterback Jeff Rutledge
following Saturday's crucial 34-16
triumph over Auburn. “if we beat
Penn State. the No. l team. we ought
to get it. according to the way it
happened last year."

Last year. of course. still rankles
Alabama. which took a No. 3
ranking into the Sugar Bowl and
crushed Ohio State while fifth-
ranked Notrc Dame trounced No. l
lcxas in the Cotton Bowl and
runner-up Oklahoma was mauled by
Arkansas in the Orang‘c Bowl.

Number One

According to all the laws of
mathematical progression. Alabama
felt it should have moved up to No.
l. Instead. it was Notrc Dame which
mailed to the top. And this year.
Southern California. Oklahoma iind

Associated Press poll. Iiave only lost

conqueror.
