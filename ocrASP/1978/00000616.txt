Coach Dan Gable led his:
defending Division I National
Champion Iowa Hawkeyes into
University Gym Saturday
at'tcrnoon,'and the crowd of 2000
made their sentiments known as they
greeted him with a rousing standing
ovation upon his introduction.

The reason is simple enoughi a
ltll-l lifetime wrestling record and-
ihc only Olympic wrestler unscored
upon in Olympic matches took the
gold medal in the I972 Olympics.
and established himselfas one ofthe
grctllcsl wrestlers of all time.

“i was impressed with theturnout,
and everyone we encountered
treated us very well," said Gable as
he spoke of the accommodations
and rcccption at University Gym.
'i‘Iic ovation he received is standard
fan for him throughout the country.
“i really appreciate it," he added,
“liut I don't like to take away from
the team's glory. because they're the
ones who are competing now."
Uahlc commented on his change—
ovcr lroni grappler to coach.
"Believe it or not, I‘m more involved
now as a couch than I was as it
wrestler. as | find myself intensely
Ilth)l\'t.'tl Ill tcn matches rntlicr than
just one. The coaching is at challenge.
as l have to handle people its
tndnnlunl wrestlers."

(table is confident of this year‘s
lowti squad in it's ttbility to retain the
national championship. “'l'hcrc‘s u
lot at tradition involved in Iowa
University wrestling," Gable said.
“liic rivalry and enthusiasm is
intense, with three traditional
rivalries just in our itate." Gable

Junior Howie Berger was the Slilr
of the day for Albany‘s grapplers as
he came off of a year's layoff to take
two impressive victories over class
opponents. In Berger's ﬁrst dual
meet in over a year. he was up
against Wl’l‘s junior co—cnptuin,
I'ony Musullo. Masullo has finishcd

He took an impressive 25-4—2
record into the match with Berger.

isn‘t as close as last year's victory
(Iowa by one-half point). but I’d be
happy to win the national
championship by one-quarter
point."

Gable's team is now 4-0, defeating

its last two opponents handily,
downing Ohio State 43-0 and
Syracuse 4l-3. The Hawkeyes head
to Lehigh for a dual meet today. “It
will be a good match for the upper
weights,“ commented Gable.
“Syracuse was a good opponent for
the roll-around style of wrestling. It‘s
a very hard technique to do well,
since you can lose a lot of back
points if you get caught in a roll.
Syracuse is well-couched. and Gene
Mills (who at till lbs. was the lone
Syracuse winner ovar an Iowa
opponent)’ has dottc a very goodjob
of picking up on the style and using it
to it great ttdvontzigc.“

Syracuse scored only three points
against defending National
Champion Iowa. and those points
were picked up via Gene Mills‘
victory over Dan Glenn in a repeat of
last year‘s NCAA I IS lb. consolation
match. Glenn topped Mills l2-8 last
year for third place in the
tournament. However. this year.
Mills came out on top, taking an 8-6
decision over his Hawkeyc
opponenL

“I just wanted to win. There was
nothing else on my mind." said
Mills. explaining the attitude he
took into the match, an attitude
which he felt gave him the edge over
tilcnn. The match didn‘t start out
well for Mills, as Glenn took a 2-0
lead with an early takcdown. Mills

Syracuse's two time NY state high
school champ at I77, Mark Davis.

ViinAntwcrp was leading 3-2 at
the end of the match, but Davis
salvaged a draw with a riding time

two by injury default. and dropped
six others to All-Americans at l26.

then rode out Mills as the‘ three-

third period began with Glenn on
top, and this time. Mills pulled the
reversal to make the score 6-4.

Mills proved himself to be a fine
roller and rider as he put Glenn on
his back twice. picking up back
points for an 8-6 lead. Glenn had
been given a stalling warning prior to
Mills' four point surge, and Iowa
coach Dan Gable remarked.
“Glennie was doing a goodjob up to
that point, but after the warning, he
lost his intensity. and Mills gained
momentum and capitalized on his
rolling style to take the match."

As the buzzer sounded, Mills
jumped jubilantly into the air. while
Glenn walked dejectcdly offthc mat,
losing not only the match, but also
his No. l rankingtothe Orangemen.

Afterwards. Mills explained that
prior to entering last year‘s
tournament. he had ripped
ligaments in his upper torso. and was
uncertain over whether he should
compete :n the Nationals, “Ijust had
to do it." he explained. “I couldn‘t
pass up the cltnncc at the Nationals.
livcn ifl got beat in the first round,
l‘d know that I‘d tried." Mills took
fourth Inst ycar despite the injury.
and Saturday proved that he
deserves to be this year‘s top seed.

Last ycnr. Syracuse copped the
Adirondack Classic by defeating
tough Michigan State and

Springfield squads. Unfortunately
for Syracuse. Mills' three team
points picked up by the decision over
Glcnn didn‘t inspire his fellow

upset.
