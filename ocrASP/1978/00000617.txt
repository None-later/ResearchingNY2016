Adirondack 'l‘ltrec-Style Wrestling
Club Wits held inthe University (iym
this past Saturday before a crowd of
2000.

Last year's Division 1 national
chainpiott Iowa left the classic
unblemished. whilc Albany State
and Syracuse split their respective

miitches. Worcester Polytechnic

"Our kids did a fine job," said
Albany coach Joe Garcia. "I was
really pleased with their
performance today."

Busy Afternoon & Night

An imaginary ribbon was sliced promptly at 12:30 Saturday after-
noon and the initial wave of enthusiasts and competitors were un-
sliered into University Gym where activities would not cease until ex-

Iii the afternoon, former Olympic champion Dan Gable was the
main attraction. Before his Iowa wrestling squad took on Syracuse. he
was presented with a large replica of the original Bowie knife. He was
careful to shy the blade from the ensuing horde of fans who instantly
rushed him seeking a signature. a handshake. or it simple glimpse.

A bald spot on the back of his head somehow didn't agree with the
broad shoulders and powerful chest beneath. He raised his eyebrows
slightly when he recognized someone in the crowd around ltim. iind
then told the group to be more concerned with the wrestling than him.

They listened. Upon the red and white round mat. Albany bested
Wl’l before Gable‘s boys tangled with the Orangemen. In the opening
match. at the lightest class. Gene Mills of Syracuse provided the ﬁnest
moment of the program when he defeated Iowa's Dan Glenn.

Mills fought twice more against Dane wrestlersrcasily taking both.
Now he was the star and it was he who stood talking with reporters and
signing the pads of young kids while a faint mustache of perspiration
above his lips sparkled under the bright light.

The day had only begun. Albany equipment manager Bennie Siegel
and the Potter Club had to whip the arena into basketball preparation.
Huge pieces of tape which had embedded the mats over the floor were
rolled up and the mats themselves were scurried off in the manner
grounds crews handle inﬁeld tarps.

At nighttime. basketball took. over. The Dane jayvee squad beat
Cortland and the varsity did too. Carmelo Verdejo charged across the
same hardwood that had witnessed headloeks and takedowns hours
earlier. and burned the cords with a soaring dunk. Again, a near-
capacity gathering voiced their approval. At exactly 10:30 they all left
