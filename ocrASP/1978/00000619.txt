Concerning the funding of
ititercollegiate athletics. SASU is
tiiaintaiiring its position favoring
coverage by the State. Rothstein
cites a ligure of SLS million as the
present annual total cost ol‘SUNY‘s
entire intercollegiate sports
program. l‘his ligure is one-tenth of

more problems.“

A major problem. said Rothstein,
is SUNY‘s total lack of any sort of
guidelines or priorities pertainingto
intercollegiate sports. This becomes
most serious at the smaller state
university colleges and agricultural
and technical schools. It is there that
many intercollegiate teams do not
know whether they will survive from
one semester to the next. Because of
inilation. programs must be cut
annually. Because ol'a lack ofSUNY
guidelines. presidents of individual
campuses are olteti forced to make
men owtt decisions annually as to
pinch sports remain in the budget
arid which are cut lrom it.

“In a lot oi crises. the campus
presidents throw it right back at
SUNY and say ‘You decide.‘ " said

ltolhstcin. I

At ‘many large universities.
seasonal box ollice receipts for one
nationally-televised “big time" sport
are sufficient to cover the other
intercollegiate sports. and fund
rtrlratnural athletics into the deal.
Such an approach would not be
leasihle lor SUNYA. however.
according to Rothstein. A period of
several years is required to developa
"big tune" sport. During this time.
all other iiitcrcollcgiatc‘sporis must

are olten out ot the picture entirely.

Lapinski explained that it simple

Lapinski.
