Some say it's because he
gave up a promising film
career to head up the
Budweiser Racing Team!

But the real reason is that
he just likes to win. And he
did plenty of that this past
season tn a pair of
Budweiser-sponsored, Bob
Sharp-prepared Datsun
race cars.

Fifteen races: Twelve wins!
On the pole eight times!
Three track records!

And in the SCCA National
Championships at Road
Atlanta, he took a second
place in his C-Productron
Datsun 980-2 . . .and a thrrd
in the B-Sedan category With
his Datsun QOO-SX.

Naturally, we congratulate
him for his super sensor
and wish him even greater
success in ‘79.

(AP) lncome taxes and sales
taxbs. property taxes and payroll
taxes.Now, the politicians are
talking about a newlevy «the value
added tax.

The value added tax. commonly
known as VAT, is actually a sort of
sales tax. imposed on a national
rather than local level. It has been
used in many parts of Europe since
the late 1960‘s; it has been proposed
in this country too but has never
received widespread support.

The latest suggestions for a U. S.
VA'l' crime in separate speeches
during the past week by Rep. Al
Ullman. l)-0rc.. the chairman ofthe
House Ways rind Means Committee.
and Sen. Russell ll. Long. l)-|.a..
chairman ol the Senate Finance
('omrnrttee.

t). Exactly what is the value
added tax"!

A. it is a tax imposed rrt every
level of prodrrctiorr and marketing
Ihe arnotirrt of the tax is based on
the value that has been ridded —-— in
costs and proﬁts at each level. It is

calculated by taking a percentage of
the difference between the purchase
price and the selling price ofanitem.
"You do it at every stage until you hit
the consumer.“ said Don Lubick,
assistant treasury secretary for tax
policy.

There are many variables. VAT

- can be imposed on goods only or. as

Long suggested. it can be applied to
both goods and services. In some
European countries. essentials are
exempt. Ullman called for a
wholesale transaction tax which
would seem to imply that it would
not involve retail stiles.

Q. What does VAT mean in
dollars and cents”!

A. Let‘s take a pound of meat as
an example. using hypothetical
prices. Assume the vrilue added tax is
it) percent. Suppose it costs a
rancher 50 cents a pound to raise a
steer. lie plans to add it) cents profit
lot it selling price of ()0 cents. The
drlterence between the amount he
paid to raise the animal and the
amount he gets for it is taxed at l0

percent. In thisex'ample. VAT works
out to a penny. That penny is added
to the selling price.

Now go to the slaughterhouse
where the steer is killed and the meat
prepared for marketing. The
slaughterhouse operator pays 61
cents a pound. He adds his costs and
profit 7 let's assume a total of 30
cents -— for a proposed selling price
ot' 9! cents. The value added tax at
this level would be 3 cents for an
actual selling price of 94 cents a
pound.

lt' the tax were applied at the

' wholesale level. it would twist the i
slaughterhouse. If. however. it were
imposed at every level; it would
continue to the grocery store.

Assume the supermarket operator

adds another 40 cents in costsand ‘

profit. That brings the selling price
up to $.34 a pound. The tax on the‘
40 cents in value added by the store is
4 cents. Final selling price: $1.38 a ,
pound. Eight cents orjust under 6
percent of the amount actually paid
by the consumer is tax.

Q. What are the advantages of
VAI‘.’

A. Supporters of a value added
tax argue that it could be used to
replace or at least lessen Social
Security taxes. “‘People are '

beginning to‘ sq'uaWkW'at the high
level of these taxes, Lubick said.
putting pressure on politicians and
other public ofﬁcials to searchfm an
alternative. ln I972. the Nixon
administration talked about VAT as
a way to reduce property taxes. Long

. said he believed that Social Security

taxes should be repealed and income
taxes limited to about 33 percent
instead ol' the present maximum of
70 percent.

Pierre Guieu. a tax expert with the
European Common Market. cited
another advantage of VAT.
"Fighting tax evasion is easier," he
said. “it imposes detailed accounting
at all levels ofeconomiccircuit and is
thus it modernizing factor . . . "

Steel Industry Seeks Fed." Help

PITTSBURGH (AP) More
shootings and stonings were

strike. as the steel industry went to

District Judge Louis Rosenbergthat
potential Witnesses had been
threatened with injury or death ifthey
showed up lor lhursday's hearing
on the lawsuit. Rosenberg ordcrcda
closed-door lrearrng on the

protection plea.

"It‘s just a trick; that‘s all it is."
said William Hill. chairman of the
striking steel hauler group. “We
ought to tell therir about some ol'the
threats against us.“

llrll‘s group struck Nov. ll to
brick its deinrrnd for higher rates,
sirnplilied regulations and the right
to bargain for independent steel
haulers, rnost ol whom own their
trucks.

lhe dispute has been punctuated .
by shootings and vandalism against
non-striking trtickcrs. most of it in
western Pennsylvania and Ohio. Hill
has said r'cpeatedly that his
