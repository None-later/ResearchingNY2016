Encare Oval” was introduced to Ameri—
can doctors in November 1977. Almost
immediately, it attracted widespread phy-
sician and patient attention.
Today. Encare Oval ls being used by
hundreds of thousands of women. and
users surveyed report overwhelming sat-
isfaction. Women using Encare Oval say
they lind it an answer to their problems
with the pill, lUD‘s. diaphragms, and aero-
sol foams.

2 EFFECTIVENESS
ESTABLISHED IN
CLINlpAL TESTS.

Enc'are Oval'“ was subjected to one ot the
most rigorous tests ever conducted for a
vaginal contraceptive Results were
excellent—showing that Encare Oval
provides consistent and extremely high
sperm-killing protection. This recent U.S.
report supports earlier studies in Euro-
pean laboratories and clinics.

Each Encare Oval insert contains a pre-
cise. premeasured dose of the potent.
sperm-killing agent nonoxynol 9. Once
properly inserted. Encare Oval melts and
gently ettervesces. dispersing the sperm-
killlng agent within the vagina.

The success of any contraceptive
method depends on consistent and
accurate use. Encare Oval ’“ is so conve—
nient you won't be tempted to lorget it.
And so simple to insert. it‘s hard to make
a mistake.

ll pregnancy poses a special risk lor you.
your contraceptive method should be Se-
ll:1l,/l(:ll alter consultation With your doctor.

Encare Oval‘“ is tree of hormones, so it
cannot create hormone-related health

problems-like strokes and heart
attacks—that have been linked to

the pill.
