CELESTIAL TEASE

The Celestial Seasonings Tea
Company. which makes a variety of
popular herb teas in the US says it
has cltanged the formula for a new
tea introduced last year because of
protests that some of the ingredients
for that particular tea came from
Soutlt Africa.

the new Emperor‘s (‘huice tea
was introduced by the company at
the Natioital Nutritional Foods
Association convention in Boston
last July.

llic tca originally contained a
blend of Ginseng and an herb called
"rurbtish," which was imported from
South Africa.

The Straight Creek Journal
reports, however, that the use ofthe
South Alrican product caused so
much protest from Celestial
Seasonings employees and
customers that the company has
revised the formula and replaced
i'tiibtish with other ingredients.

Company President Mo Siege]
told T/lt' .qurml/ that lie and other
managers were "shocked" at the
intensity ol the reaction to their rise
ol South Al'iican products.

Sicgcl says that the company got a
number UI letters iind phone calls
li‘om Celestial Seasonings users,
\\ ho complained the company was
"selling out likeothercorporations."

HAWAIIAN HARVEST

Some 100 federal officers
representing six different
government agencies have launched
a new series of raids on the
imirijuana-producing areas of the
island of Hawaii.

Ihc cttrrcnt campaign is the
second round of so-callcd
"Operation Green Harvest.“lt
reportedly involves federal officers.
as well as deputies from fotir
Hawaiian counties, who are utilizing
helicopters, airplanes and boats in
one of the biggest pot crackdownsin
Hawaiian history.

Alter the first day of the raid.
police confirmed sciIing IOOO
pounds ol plants and 43 pounds of '
processed marijuana. Hawaiian
marijuana. which is among the most
expensive mid potcnt weed in the
world. is in the midst of its peak
hanest season.

HIGH & MIGHTY
lucnty-six members ol'thc Ilousc
ol Representatives say they have
smoked marijuana at least once.
“till a majority of these admittingto
smoking the “evtl” wccd on a regular
hnsm.

lhis is the finding of a survey
conducted by Play/my Maga'line in
which House and Senate members
were asked to fill out questionnaires
concerning their pot-smoking
habits.

Not a single senator admitted to
using the weed. altliotigli I’fll‘l'htlrl'
says that lollow-up interviews with
Senate sources disclosed fivc
senators who are “dedicated pot
siiiokeis."

Representative Morris Udall is
quoted by the magazine as stating
that at least 40 members of the
House are smokers. Says Udall: “ My
conservative guess is that at least l0
percent of the members smoke."
Udall msits lie is not among that l()
pciccnl.

According to f'frfl'btl‘l‘: “The most
noticeable pothcads in the House
and Senate eluded attempts to
interview them as adroitly as dope
runners slip past customs."

THE PILL FOR HIM

A report published by the World
Ilcaltli Organization is predicting
that a male birth control pill could he
pcrlcctcd in a mere twelve years.

Developing a suitable pill for men
to take Iias been complicated up
until now because the suppression of
sperm formation required doses of
hormones considerably higher than
any of those used by women. Those
doscs have reportedly caused
considerable harmful side effects,
including reddening of the eyes and
severe headaches.

Scientists. writing in the journal
ll’urlr/ [lea/Ill. however. say that a
new class of pill being tested consists
of material which does not inhibit
sperm production, but simply
interferes with its metabolism and
maturity. lhe researchers predict
that pill will be ready to market by
"the end of the next decade."

lhe World Health bulletin also
pi edicts that an “anti-fertility"
vaccine cotild also be ready for use
