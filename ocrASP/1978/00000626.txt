tertility dances and mystical rites

7 y early (irecks. Those roots were
Fr t wing on Saturday night at 7 when the
rehitig satyrs, directed by Constance
V. . cavorted on the Main Stage of the
rlorming Arts Center.
And the main stage was a crowded
c of sitters as well as Satyrs m as
audience was treated to really

stimulation. The wickedly sensual skill
with which Myrlin Valerio as Kyllene
extricated and manipulated the string of
beads from Silenus‘ pocket. and Silenus'
consequent displays of intense sensitivity
in response to her remote control
stimulation formed one of the most
memorable comic episodes of the
e\cning.

Back iii tltc fourth century l<l.(~ when
“Iclincutztc” was written. Dionysus was
patron oI the Drama; in fact the great
dramatic lcslivttl ol Athens was named
the Dionysta III his honor. litit Dionysus
had another singular claim to fame he
gave tiic (irecks the gift of the grape,
enlightening them in the ecstasy of
irresponsible Iticbriiition and the
(irccks loved him lor it. So they wrote
litiii plays. a titling gift and at the
Dionysia they relieved the accumulated
tension ol hack-to—hack dramatic tragedy
by perlormiiig a Satyr play alter every
three tragedies. Historically. then. the
Satyr play is a kind oi" creative
intermission. and "Searching Satyrs“
remains today a pleasant pause amid the
tension ol back—to-back booking.
