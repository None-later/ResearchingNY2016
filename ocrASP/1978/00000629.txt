Rose Encountered Other

Problems Besides Leaving -

.CINCINNATI (AP) Deciding‘

dill'icult enough for Pete Rose.
Keeping his new team a secret was
another matter.

Sun Petey. 9. "almost let the cut

his mother Karolyn. '

Rose said 'l‘ucsday that he would

reported $3.2 million over {our years

the highest salary in sports.
l’ctcy‘s first slip came when he
incntittncd to Kurolyn's brother. 8
Cincinnati policeman. that the
Iainily would be in Clearwater. Fla.
lni spring training next March.

"Luckily. my brother didn't pick
up on it, said Ktirulyii.

with the only major league team he
had ever played for.

Until Petey called from the
attorney's ofﬁce with the news
Sunday morning, Karolyn expected
her husband to sign with either
Pittsburgh or Kansas City.

"I didn‘t believe it at ﬁrst." she
said. “But he’s always wanted to play
tor the l’llilllcs. It goes back about
lch years when we started having
Larry Down and Greg Luzinaki over
[or dinner."

llcing appreciated by his employer
meant it lot to Rose. his wife said.

“He meant it when he said he
wished he could play one year with
ctcry team he talked with. That's
coming from his heart. They were so
nice to hint." she explained.

Slic said Rose‘s disenchantment
with Cincinnati management grew
when the cluh hunncd his son from
thc clubhouse it ctiuplcol'ycars ago.

“llc wants his son to be like him
and that was om: ol' the ways they
could ltc together more. It hnthcrcd
