’Bucks’Kevin Restani Is

Now, Coming Into His Own

MILWAUKEE (AP) Kevin Restani
is a born-again Milwaukee Buck.

The veteran. in his second go-
round with the Bucks. is averaging
15 points and ID rebounds per game.
since moving in as the starting power
forward in place of Dave Meyers.
who is out indefinitely with back
trouble.

Coach Don Nelson had tried
switching center John Gianelli to
iorwrird and starting Kent Benson at
center. but that only hurt the club at
both positions. So last month he
moved Gianelli back into the middle.
put Benson back on the bench and
gave the starting forward position to
Restirni.

"Kevin will remain a starter until
we know about David." said Nelson.
“He's been giving us rebounding,

something we desperately lacked.
lie‘s limited in some respects, but
he's a smart player and he's been
playing very well."

Restani spent three season with
the Bucks before being cut last fall.
He caught on with Kansas City. but
played only 547 minutes in 54 games
last season and got more bad news
over the summer.

Didn't Figure

“1 hey told me that because they
had a coaching change. i didn't
figure in their plans."said the 6-foot-
9. 225—pounder who will be 28 next
month. “i was pretty sure i would be
playing in ltaly this year. But i didn‘t
want to go. so i called Nellie."

Kansas City agreed not to ask for
compensation Il the Bricks decided
to sign Restatti. so Nelson invited

him to training camp.

“Nellie said he didn’t think I could
make this team, but he invited me to
camp pretty much as a favor." said
Restani. “At least he could play me
in exhibitions. and maybe someone
else would see me and pick me up."

But when Meyers hurt his back on
the first day of camp and aggravated
the injury in exhibition play. Restani
gained a place in the Buck‘s thinking.
Ironically. since Restani became a
starter. Benson has been playing
better as a reserve.

"I had been playing a lot in a high
post and l‘m not much good to the
team out there.“ said Benson. the
second-year man who was such a big
disappointment last season. “But
Kenn is a great outside shooter and
my strength is inside. With him
playing outside. 1 can take more
rrdurntagc of my strength down
low."

“It‘s gotten almost to the point
where a o-i'oot-ti or 6-foot~9 center
can't play the game.“ said Nelson.
