Mixed Views On Sports Decision

NEW YORK (AP) Th:
announcement by the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
that the same amount of money per
capita must be spent on women‘s
sports as on men‘s _ sports has
brought strong‘ negative reaction
from several . factions of the
collegiate sports world.
GIIdIy Accepted

the decision exempting football
troin the regulations Was accepted
gladly by most schools. however.

In attempting to clarify the
procedures of compliance with Title
IX, the I972 law outlawing sex
discrimination on college campusesI
flEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano

Jr. announced the policy
interpretation. Footbhll was given
"special consideration" and. in
essence. excluded from the equal
spending per capita decision.

Susan Hall, coordinator of
women's athletics at Oklahoma
State. felt the announcement was
much ado about nothing.

"It looks nice on paper." Hall said.
“but when you get to the nifty-gritty.
we want to survive."

Hall said she felt equalizing
dollars spent on men's and women's
sports could ctruse'a cut in athletic
programs for botli sexes.

"liven as adamant as I am on
equality of sports. the matching

dollar ruling puts me in a state of
shock." she said. ’

Hall added that equalization and
recruiting is fair because "it costs a
female athlete as much money to go
to school as a male athlete.“

Decision Effect

Dean Pryor. athletic director at
Arkansas State, thought his school
would be hurt by the decision but
"maybe not as bad as the Ohio State
and Michigans.

"My first reaction is that I don‘t
know where we‘re going to fund it.
We figure that next ycar, for our
program to be in line with,Titlc lX.
we'll probably have to double our
expenditures in women‘s athletics."

Big-Time Colleges May Luck Out

WASHINGTON (AP) Colleges
with major football teams‘ w now
under federal orders to divide most
men‘s sports revenue with women's
athletic programs ~ appear headed
for a reprieve. .

Schools with expensive men's
basketball programs may also get
special treatment.

the Carter administration issued
proposed ticw guidelines Wednesday
attired at clarifying current
regulations barring sex
discrimination in intercollegiate
athletics.

flat some interested parties said
special exceptions in the new
gutdcltncs make them unclear, and
one critic. Lynda Weston of the
i'rtijUCl on Equal Education
Responsibility, said. “lf looks like
they blew a hole right down the
middle of the law."

Joseph A. Califano Jr.. the

secretary of Health. Education and
Welfare. told a news conference the
proposed guidelines are to ensure
that colleges provide women an
equal opportunity in athletics, but he
said they also take into account
economic realities facing schools.

the gttidclincs are issued under
litlc IX. adopted six years ago to bar

sex discrimination in educational K

institutions receiving federal aid.

t‘aliftirio will accept comment for
on days before deciding whether to
pill the proposals iiitti effect in time
for the I979 school year.

[he guidelines require that
expenditures on men‘s and women's
athletics be proportional to the
number of men and women
participating. lluf not always.

lhe standard of “substantially
equal per capita expenditures" can
be sidestepped if a school can
demonstrate that spending

differences are based on what
L'athftirio called "non—discriminatory
factors such as the cost ofasport. . .
the equipment rcqtiircd or the scope
of competition."

"llic interpretation recognizes
that intercollegiate football. in

of revenue Il generates." said
