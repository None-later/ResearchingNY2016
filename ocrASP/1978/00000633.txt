Illegal Oneonta Move

llie festive atmosphere of the
recent Adirondack Classic has now
faded and the Albany State wrestling
tearit has to buckle down to the
challenge of a long season of regular
competition. After the celebration of
the Classic, normal meets could
seem dull and everi routine.

Opening up their SUNYAC
ledger. however. the Danes showed
no signs of a lapse as they defeated
()nconta 28-21 Tuesday night.
Coming off the split of two matches
at the Adirondack‘s. they now ownti
l-l record and have a quickjump on
the conference with a l-Oloop mark.

In it tight contest. Albany
wrapped up the triumph at the 150
class. they did it in a manner lacking

in drama. but lull of pain for one of
the belligerents. Mike (ireco was
pitted against the Dragons‘ Andy
Jacobs. After 40 seconds of the first
period. they were fairly even when
Jacobs lifted the Dane atop his head
wrtli an illegal hold and hurled him
iii the mat.

Urcco was hurt and unable to
continue the bout. Since the move
that had forced this injury was
illegal. Albany was awarded the
match on a forfeit which gave them
six additional points. That result
virtually concluded the contest.
Later. led David took the I90

"()iieonta beat two of our better'

Carmelo Verdcjo and Barry
Cavanaugh took their inside scoring
show on the road Wednesday night
and took turns perfecting their act.
which closed with Albany State's
third straight triumph.

Later editions of the show are
expected and audiences should not
discount at season—long engagement.
for in this first away contest. the
Dane duo worked the foul lane with
smashing results all evening. They
even complemented each other by
courteously switching bolts ‘to
dominate and the show ended with
Albany scurrying off a 69-63 victory'
over llinghainton.

tiroupcd with two earlier wins the
Danes now possess an impressive 3—0
record and tnorc importantly, by
virtue of the Colonial triumph, they
are 2-0 iii the SUNYACconfcrence.
Winning the league title would give
Albany automatic entrance into the
NCAA Div. III basketballplayoffs.

“We took our time on offense and
started to work the ball inside to
Carmelo and Barry which is what we
like to do." said Dane coach Dick
Situers. "liut neither of them have
started to really rebound ttio well yet
and they have to start doing that
better. We‘re heading iitto the tough

part of our schedule now."

in the opening half it was Verdejo
who sparked the attack before a
small gathering in Binghamton‘s
Men‘s Gymnasium. Albany guards
lluddy Wleklinski and Rob Clune
consistently threaded passes through
a lackluster Colonial defense and
Iourid Vcrdcjo alone underneath for
lriytips. l‘hc 6‘4" senior put in soft
shots regularly and scored to first
hall points enrotrtc to 17 for the

game.
More important for the Danes
was llicir shutting off of

liirighaniton's highly touted guard
led lltill. Entering the game with a
better than 20 ppg. average. he was
expected to be the main Colonial
tlirctit. But Wlekliitski and liill
liellamy shadowed him throughout
the night and alter a while his own
frustration was iiti added defender.
lltill could manage onlyfour points.

“I had planned to ltave Buddy on
litill btit he got two quick fouls in the
opening half so l quickly switched
Bellamy onto him." Sauers
explained. “'I hey both did an
excellent job on him defensively. He
usually makes their offense go and
we shut him off totally.“

Bellamy. however. was injured in
the process of his defensive gem and

wrestlers so that shows you how
solid the rest of the learn is since we
still managed to take the meet." said
Albany assistant coach Brad llamer.
"We‘re very pleased with the waytlic

quadrangular with some tough
SUNYAC opponents this Saturday.
and after that We should have a
better gauge of how good we really
