increased costs. A itu'giber of other
factors of which.  new to the
Univeristy. he was unaware. had to
be brought to his attention.” _
‘ According to Rothstein. two of the.
major proposals currently underl
consideration by the Smoot
eon: mitlee are the “Potsdam Plan"
and the “California Plan." The
Potsdam Plan. named for SUC
Potsdam. where his currently under
study. would involve a mandate that
a specific percentage ofthe Student
Activity fee (to be the same at all
campuses) be allocated specifically
to intercollegiate sports and co-
eurricufar programs. The funds set
aside would then be administered
locally. by a board composed of 50
percent students and 50 percent

faculty and administrators. The 1

Lalifornia Plan is so named for the
"institutionalIy-rcfatcd activity lax"
let-red throughout that side. Under
this plan. a separate fee would be
established by the SUNY Board of
Irustees. collected for the sole
beriefrt of co—curricular activtties and
intercollegiate athletics.

SA President Paul Feldman
opposes both plans because they
take student money out of student
hands. because they are not covered
by IAP. and because the term “co-l
curricular" . has never been
adequately defined.

"they‘re really not acceptable
all." said I-efdman. “1 hey presume
that student governments are not
doing a goodjob in the allocation of
the fee. We respond to student needs
quickly. When students change and
their needs shift. we change. It's as
simple as that. Students should be
totally in controll of their own
tiioney. llial‘s a basic philosophical
fact."

'\\e have the time and the
iletiioiistrated comniittment to a
teiy careful budgeting process which
eorribriics elements of stability and‘
lfesibilty, which is very important."
said f~eldman. “I question rheability
of a lot of different constituencies to
allocate the fee.“

f-eldinan rejected Smool's

  

division of ‘co—curricufar activities
into the areas of: competitive sports.
recreational sports. fine arts, and
performing arts as much too general.

“My deﬁnition of co—cumcular
activities is ‘any activity that
complements or supplements-formal
curriculum that this university
offers,” said Feldman. “This would
be applicable to University
Cinematography Association as ran
extension of cinema courses. or to
the ASP as an extension of the
Journalism Department. If you have
public policy analysis and public
attairs courses in which you discuss
public interest groups, from the new
public policy major to Political
Science 100. then the chance for
students to take theoretical
abstractions learned in the
classroom and apply them is co-
eurricular. It makes it a real thing.

Alliance a 'co-curricular actrvrtyft
Yes. We have a Women‘s Studies
program that students ars given
academic credit for. If thats not a
eo—curricular activity. I don't know
what is."

According to Feldman. student
activin fee dollars often go to pay
for programs which should be state-

rrted.

“Elfin example." said Feldman.
"when the Theater Arts Department
doesn‘t have enough money to put
on their productions it is the student
.ietrtity fee that ts called upon to pay
for the productions. And we do. But
there are people here saying. 'Hey.
ire shouldn't be spending student
actttitv fee money for this.”

l‘Clthll‘dIl believes that we should
not be spending student activity fee
money for intercollegiate athletics
eitftei. He said that they should be
paid for by the state. precisely the
goal of SASU's newest lobbying
effort in the legislature.

New Mideast Progress Reported

CAIRO. EGYPT (AP) Secretary of
State Cyrus R. Vance today reported
he and President Anwar Sadat had
made “good progress" in trying to
resolve the key issues holding up a
peace treaty with Israel.

Ilut he said more discussions are
needed with the Egyptian leader and
"we have not yet reached the final
deetston."

Vance spoke with reporters after
meeting with Sadat for the second
time in two days at the Egyptian
president‘s Nile-side villa north of
Cairo. Ifie American envoy was

flying to Israel later today to attend
the funeral of former Prime Minister
trolda Meir on Tuesday. and he said
he wuul'd return to Cairo Tuesday
for more talks.

Despite his report of progress.
\aiicc hedged on whether a peace
agreement is‘ in sight. “It‘s up to the
parties to decide whether or not they
can reach agreement." he said.

He added that it would be
speculation to say whether an
agreement could be concluded by
next Sunday. the Dec. I7 target date
set in the Camp David agreements of

last September. .

Iiarlier in the day Vanee's
mediation group met for two hours
with top Egyptian officials. led by
Prime Minister Mustnfa Khalil. to
follow up on the American envoy’s
talks with Sadat Sunday. In the
Sunday session Sadat reportedly
pressed for more “active Anterican
participation“ in breaking the
deadlock.

\ance told reporters both sides

"implement" the initial Vance-Sadat

discussion and met this morning “to

Court Decides Inheritance Policy

WASHINGTON (AP) The
Supreme Court has upheld a New
lorlt State law setting conditions
under which ait illegitimate cfiild can
inherit pull of the father‘s estate
when the parent dies withouta will.

stand a statute that says an
illegitimate child must get a court

estimate of a 30 percent budget
allotment to athletics. while Falkin‘s
is based on a low cstlmaté of 18
percent. ’

f-alkin attributes the potentially
giant increase in athletic funding at
§lli\\ Binghamton to the low
priority which sports has taken at
tllltl school.

"lhere just aren't enough
interested athletes on our campus."
said f-afkin. “ f Iierejusi isn‘t any way
that the athletes on our campus
could spend $l20.000. ltwould bean
incredible waste of money.
Iorlunately. student governments
hate devious ways ot'ctrcumvcnting
such things. We can just allocate
5100.000 to the Ultimate Frisbee
tcaiti. and spend $20,000 on the rest.
[here are ways to get around it if
they‘re going to put our backs up
against a wall."

l-afftiii remains optimistic that
athletics may soon be in the realm of
state»fuiided programs.

III“ by student decision. it should be
slate-funded."

Although I-rifkin opposes an
athletic fee structure. he does so for
different reasons than does
I-eldman. l‘itlkin calls the idea of
sitcli a structure foolish. us it
depends upon funds which are
highly unstable. fluctuating fiom year
to year. and reflecting rising and
falling enrollments. This tends to
afteet the smaller SUNY branches
Lunch triore than it does the
comparatively stable student
populations of the four university
CL'lllUl'S.

In addition. Falkin notes that fee
structures make athletics unpopular.

"Certain people support athletics
no matter wfiat. and some don‘t
really care about athletics. but as
long as you don‘t have to pay for
tlieiit. they're okay." said Falkin. “If
you force students to pay for them
they're going to be pissed. It's
entirely inappropriate . to tell
students anything about what they
do With their money."

uThe only justification for a
mandatory fee is if students have
control of it and are taxing
themselves." said SUNY Stony
Itruok Policy Executive Director
Bill Camarda. “It‘s very. very, very
wrong. It acts to place students
between a rock and a hard place. If
they impose an additional fee
