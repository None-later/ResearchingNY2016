the most modern of all: disco.

In the lirst set, emcccd by Elizabeth
Harris and Peter Vcnneman. four
groups performed. The Onondaga &

chantcd their versions of “We Wish
You A Merry Christmas," “White
Christmas“ and “Joy To The World."

interludes of jail. and by a bouncy
bunch of performers.

ot the Iamous rcindeer‘s song. They
pcrlornicd an amusing skit: Santa
visited the Rafters and metallic antlers
adorned the heads ofthe disco reindeer
as they performed their versions of
popular disco hits such as “Macho
Man,“ “Night Life" and “More than a
Woman.“ This gi’oup received the
award for originality.

Chi Sigma Theta, the winners of the
Musicality Award, made their first
appearance singing “Let There Be
l’eacc on liarth.“ 'I‘heir style was
mellow, yct their voices carried
throughout the Ballroom. The sorority
sisters appeared almost regal, wearing
long dresses, and corsagcs. Closingthe
set was the SUNYA Barbershop
Quartet who placed second in the
musicality category. ’l'hcy presented
an unusual rendition of“Jingle Bells":

group's sportsmanship was less than

signs appeared over their heads,
reading “Great Chord," praising the
crooners whenever they reached one.

I he second set opened with emcees
Germaine Curtin and Marshal
Rosenberg introducing Psi Gamma
and Tau Kappa Epsilon doinga medley
oI traditional Christmas carols. This
was a rare combination of beautiful
music, harmony, and exquisite voices.

Following them and providing an
interesting contrast, was the Residents
and Friends oi'Johnson Hall. Between
25 and 3t) unruly men piled onto stage,
and belted out familiar holiday
melodies such as “Winter
Wonderland," “Jingle Bells," and
“ Rudolph.“ I'he guys were a little off
key, but their enthusiasm and the spirit
they evoked lrom the audience more
than compensated for it.

In even greater contrast was the

Albany State Kickline. Followingthat
mass of men, the girls, in matched
outlits of red, white and green, kicked
their way on stage to the familiar tune
"Jingle Bell Roek.“'l'his group, almost
ready to compete with the Rockettes,
swept the award for Dance out from
under the judges.

Closing this set was a rare act, and a
tough one to beat. The Potter Club, as
rowdy as they were. took over the
show, and won the award for spirit.
I hey produced humorous, boisterous
(although all key) versions of “White
Christmas,“ and “Merry Christmas
Dear SUNYA." 'l'hc l’otter Club
realized “ . . . we ain't getting nothin‘
for Christmas“ because “ . . . we ain’t
been nothing but bad." This unusual
group was led by Santa with a belly
hanging to his knees, wearing a plastic
nose and glasses, conducting both the

"Little l'own of Bethlehem." 1n the .
linalvcompetition, they placed third in

following the first intermission, meg
International Folk Dance Club ° '
showed up, and danced a Dutch Folk
dance to “Jingle Bells," a
Czechoslovakian dance, two a
traditional American dances, and an
Israeli dance. It was quite
disappointing that this was the only '9 .
representation of the Jewish faith
throughout all of the Sing.

Alter the call-backs, and a second
intermission, awards were presented, ’
with a special one given by Holiday
Sing coordinators Liz Harris and Pete .
Vcnneman to Howie Woodruff, for ° -
participating in Holiday Sing for the
third consecutive year. Robin
Steinkohl and Marshall Rosenberg .
presented the rcmainderofthe awards,
and closed the show.
