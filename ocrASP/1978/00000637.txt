POT AND LENSES

Contact lens wearers who have
wondered why their eyes hurt when
they smoke pot now have an answer
from a New York optometrist.

Doctor Harry Hollander of the
New York Sight Improvement
Center reports that he studied his
pot-smoking contact-wearing clients
alter one patient complained that
smoking grass with her lenses on
hurt her eyes.

Ilollander says he discovered that
for a vast majority of his clients. this
was true.

According to Hollander, the
reason for the irritation is that poi-
smoking inhibits the tearing process
and as a result, the liquid buffer
between the eye and the lens
disappears. He says for people
wearing the softlpr of contact lens.
this can be extremely serious because
these types of lenses must remain
constantly wcl.

Hollander recommends that ifpot
smokers must smoke with their
contacts on. it‘s a good idea to keepa
hotllc ol wetting solution on hand
right next to your roach clip.

FADED JEANS

been growing wildly since the protest
days of thc I960's. has suddenly

reporting they are experiencing a
completely unexpected worldwide
denim glut. Demand for the jeans.
they say. has fallen way behind the
expanding supplies.

As a result. several major denim-
making factories in the south have
reduced their work-weeks from six
to four days; the J.P. Stevens
Company has closed down about
half of its denim-producing looms;
and the traditional bluejeans trend-
setter. Levi Strauss reports its
second quarter profits declined by a
whopping 535 million this year.

CIRCUMDECISION

A Kansas man has reached an out-
oi~court settlement in a casein which
a doctor's clinic gave him a
vasectomy instead of u circumcision
he requested.

lhirty-ycar old Jamcs Bradshaw
ol Delphos. Kansas. who is a
Catholic. claimed he went to a local
clinic in 1975 to undergo a
circumcision operation. He
conlcnds that when he appeared for
the opcralion. his doctor was out of
town and he pcrmitlcd another
physician to perform lhc surgery.

Bradshaw says he was stunned to

not been performed, but that he had

The amount of the out-of-court

JOGON...

The [.03 Angeles Times reports
that the current ﬁtness craze in
America is causing an upheaval in
certain corners of the clothing
industry.

the newspaper reports that
Americanjoggcrs alone have run off
some ZBI million pounds this year.
That. The times says. is equivalent
lo the weight of a herd of more than
|.2 million slaughter-ready hogs.

’I‘Iw 'l'inuu' says that as a result of
the fitness craze. tailors are being
bombarded with increased demands
from men and women who want
their suits and dresses cut down to
their trim new sites. Beltmakcrs
report that the average size ofa bclt
has dropped from 36 and 38 inches
to a mere 32 and 34. and that a
number oi clothing manufacturers
are also marketing suits with smaller
waists.

lhc newspapcr adds. however.
that all is not well on the fitness

front. One Houston tailor admitted
that he had done a number of
alterations for ﬁtness freaks. but he
added. the reverse was also true. The

. tailor said that about 25 to 30

percent of his alterations are "for
people who quit jogging and ﬁlled
out again."

CHOCOPOLY

The exclusive Dallas. Texas
department store. Nieman Maren.
is offering a unique version of the
game Monopoly. you might say. is in
very good taste.

The Monopoly game is, in the
ctlluloguc's words. “the greatest
finale to a dinner party ever
conceived. From board to dice. each
part is , made of delectable and
completely edible candy — dark
chocolate. milk chocolate, butter
cream and butter scotch."

In case you're interested. the
connoisseur's Monopoly game sells
for a mere 5600.

CONTACT SMOKER

Non-smoking women married to
smoking husbands die on the
average of four years earlier than
those whose husbands don'tsmoke.

Ihis is the conclusion of an

Pennsylvania, for’ the years I972
through I975.

Miller says he and his assistants
interviewed 8000 survivors of the
deceased and recorded detailed
information on smoking habits.
work habits, health and weight and
the spouse‘s smoking habits.

Miller says he found that the
average age of death for wives of
non—smoking men was 78 years,
compared to 74 years for women
married to smokers.

Miller says that a person who lives
with a smoker inhales a lot of the
harmful smoke and is acutually a
"passive" smoker her or himself.

SINATRA'S BEST

01' Blue Eyes is apparently
making some easy greenbacks these
days.

Newsweek Magazine reports that
Frank Sinatra, who has turned down
numerous offers to appear in
commercials. received a six-ﬁgure
fee just for allowing Lincoln-
Mercury to play part of one of his
old records The Best Is Yet To Come
as background for one of its current
I V commercials.

If that's the starting ﬁgure for
Sinatra commercials, one might say
that the best is yet to come.
