Unions Are
Necessary

To the Editor:

Unions are necessary to a university faculty
both for the faculty's protection against
exploitation by its employer. and for the
pteservation of a true university.

It employers, including the State of New
lotk. were as benevolent as the two highly
ltlcllltsllc. but widely impractical. and
essentially foolish. l’otsdam professors think,
I/lt‘l’t' wig/ii be nu need for a union. We would
till he pun! who! we “’1' worth — which is more
tiiaii we are getting and we would all have
ample time tor research or other scholarly
activity (that we are supposed to do) # in
sltort. time to think. plan, and do newthings:
we would have adequate departmental]
budgets lor teacliitig supplies, and so on. [I
only it were so!

Uur civil service colleagues are not so naive.
they have long maintained it union. the
t SLA. Our K-lZ colleagues are not so naive.

Quack! Quack!

To the Editor:

An open letter to the student body: As some
til you know. there are a nutnber of ducks
littiig oti tltc pond beliind ltidiatt Quad. These
ducks get plenty to cat in the summer: besides

tlictt natural foods. they get plenty of bread

Iioiii people who think they're cute.
luiiortuiiately. the ducks come to depend on
this kind of lceding. and the people who found
it pleasant to go down and see the ducks on the
warm days think it too_ much of a hassle to
mature down to the pond in the winter.

liccattsc they've beeti‘fed all year. these
ducks won't migrate. and when the pond
iice/es otci they‘ll lose the source of their
annual Ioods. I led them everyday ofthe last
ttto \timcis: last yeat. some ol them [role to
death and some ot tliciu didn‘t. I graduated

t took me somewhere iii the
area of four to ﬁve years for
me in buy a stereo.

This can be thought of an
an unusually long time for one
‘to make a relatively minor life decision.

After all, one does not agonize over the ‘
choice of Pioneer versus Marantz the way
one would about medicine versus law.

It has been my experience that once
human beings discover the limitless realm
of music and the almost miraculous
nature of hi fidelity reproduction, the
importance which these two quantities
take on is significant._ in other words.
consider that friend of yours who really
didn't get into music or see concerts but
watched TV all the time, until he/she got
his/ tier stereo. Then. no one else could get
a night ol‘sound sleep in the house unless
the rig was down for routine
maintenance.

it is a wonderous thing. it is far too
abstract a feeling to dojustice to with only
a pen in your hand. I wish I could bring
you home and put on that record for you.
No, not the one that sounds like it was
recorded in someone‘s mausoleum with
the microphones a mile away. The other
one. the one in a thousand where some
California hippie who plays recording
engineer decided to earn his keep for a
changc atid really did justice to the
performance.

that piece ol Vinyl is worth a hell of a
lot more than $4.49 at Just-A-Song. That

piece of vinyl is sacred. Sometimes,
irreplaceable.

It is that piece of vinyl which demands
tbatjustice be done to it. I mean it. [have _
spoken to many people who have
considered the matter carefully and have
said the same thing. That XAM special
for $99just will not cut it. You can still
enjoy the record. but like the ﬁlet of beef
that is smothered in catsup. your
appreciation of it is clouded at best.

I am explaining this badly. Speak to
your friend who bought that stereo a
while ago. The one who dropped out of
high school. estranged his partner and
alienated his parents because all he did
most of tltc day was cut, excrete. and
listen. That person has discovered what i
am speaking of. That person can put on
the record we were listening to earlier.
and completely transcend thcfact that his
gut is empty, he has no friends. the -
landlord is prosecuting for the rent. and
the rabbit died. He has before him a
performer, a band. a symphony
orchestra. '

I don‘t mean this metaphorically. He
can. t can - you can close your eyes and
have it all in front of you. The vocals

center and nice and close, lead and
rltytlitn left and right and right up tltcrc.
bass nice and clear but a little further
back, and drums hitting you with the kind
of sock that means you‘re sitting right in
lront of them.

Or the New York Philharmonic. v
thought that your living rooiti was 9 by
l2‘.’Closc your eyes. Listcntothc music. If
the record is good. the seat is the best in
the house. And half a million dollars
worth of talent is yours to enjoy. The
dynamics are breathtaking, the
performance is dazzling. and the
instruments sound just. well... .just like

.tlic last time you were at the new Avery
mm Hall. And. best of all. it‘s yours to
have anythu you can put on that flat disc .
of vinyl and be in the mood to close your
eyes and take yourself there.

The point is this: no. buyiugu stereo is
probably not as important a decision as
whether or not to marry your hiin school
sweetheart or lace the shotgun. But
investing the time and exploring the
situation as fttlly as possible is deﬁnitely{
