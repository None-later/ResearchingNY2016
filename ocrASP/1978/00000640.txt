high esteem lntemationally that twelve years ago all

responsible for the constant growth of Grado.

ItIlL' recognition for the service it provides.
tiiilortutiatcly. the Student Association has
Iiomi great disrespect for its SA funded
vioups. by its failure to institute the Ioiig

Final
Complaint

0 the Editor:

1 liould like to make one final complaint
"ltll'L' llllCI'SCSSI()n concerning the unsanitary
iiiditions in the Colonial Quad Cafeteria.
Last Wednesday night I went todinner with
I) stalemate and after getting our meal. we
otii went to the salad bar. As I was picking up

' -iolk to put sortie cucumbers in my salad

mi. I spotted this gross thing crawling right
i I") “tiger. One can guess what that gross
“ll: was It was a cockroach. I was so
sgustctl With this scene that I couldn't even

', tempt to eat my dinner. The following

,Iday alternoon. my whole suite went down
I lunch. Alter getting my sandwich. and
aiding the salad bar. Ilound a table tosii at,

V. with eating my turkey sandwich, and these
,' )‘h behind me said “What is that thing

wlnig on the ttible‘!" I turned around and
titled on even grositer cockroach lliiili
lore,

think that something should be done about
it tlingsling situation. When I complained

,' We of the head women in the cafeteria,

  
   
   

out the situation she said that tinting
cisession the place will be tliiiiigated. Wh)’
‘ It lllIltl Christmas break when it should and
lltl be done beloi‘e.

l‘or once. I hope that UAS will be open to
the suggestion of cxterniinating rather than

lilinigating the calctcria immediately.

Appropriate
Funding?

To the Editor:

i would liketo take this opportunitytoclear
up \tililt.‘ apparent musconeeptions on the
mac ot Stale lunding tor athletics. In Adrian
\.iiice‘s recent letter. there exists a confusion
ol the issues oi student control over the
Student Activity lice. and how inappropriate
the use ot sl50.tit)tl of that ice for funding
athletics is. Ihis inappropriateness is
c\ idcneed by the lact that in 48 states what is
seen as appropriate is for the state to fund its
collcgcs' athletic programs. Realistically.
Student Association would not be funding
.itlilctlcs. the athletic program would prefer
\IIIIL' tlliidiiig and students as a group should
ltl\t)l Irceilig up ot such a large sum of their
money. lzsplinsion ol the funding of the
caiiiptis‘ groups to the extents we would all
like ttI sec could take place.

this leads us to the second issue; that of
sitltlclit control over this money. Should the
tioiiid ot trustees consider the imposition of
slllL'lL'I guidelines on how student elected
iepiescntaiives can spend student dollars on
\llItlL‘lll activities or. should they consider
momma from students the control over
disbursement of thesefunds; then we surely have
reason to be outraged. Already we have seen
Ilie iidliiimstration in effect cast a veto thus
litl'. on the money Central Council
appropriated for the Record Co-op to run a
"head shop". as well as that for funding of the
Student Union. It is these types ofintolerablc
acts at which we ailn our comments on the
liiiieielit right for students to control the
allocation of the student activity fee. The
Itiiidliig tor athletics. however. is a thing which
\\t.' slltlllltl neither be disbursing nor paying
liil ll

We do not ask for outrageous sums to buy
cats and steaks lor the athletes as in the
.'\I i/ona incident we ask only for the frugal
.iiiiounts athletics ctlrrently ‘survives' on to be
taken over by the state. Lo million dollars
stitterdc must be it drop in the bucket when
one considers that the state had I6 million to
spare lot it stadium at Syracuse Universityli

that could Itiiid SUNY athletics for Ichars!

titil parents need not pay more. and we should
be receiving more for what we do pay.

0t Symbolism and SUNY

A trcnchcoatcd ﬁgure lurking in a corner on the podium. An exchange student
enticed by an undercover agent. Sound farfctched? Guess again.

Alter probes by the Church committee of the US Senate, it was determined that the
Central IntEingcnoe Agency docs recruit on universities throughout the country..But at
struggling SUNYA? Maybe.

the only way to ﬁnd out is to ask and even that doesn‘t guarantee a straight answer
Irom the CIA. Stony Brook and Binghamton tried it and ended up in on report with
three blank pages and only the words: “SUNY Bingbamton" left unscathed by the
censor's razor.

liven It the tiles soon to be requested from the Senate's Council on Academic
I-rccdom and Ethics come through and SUNYA adopts guidelines on CIA activity.
what of it‘.’ What of it. when the director ofthe CIA has made a firm statement that he
intends to simply ignore Harvard University's adopted guidelines?

So maybe the whole time consuming process of writing a request. going through the
tiles. and assigning committees the task of formulating guidelines, will turn into onlya
symbolic gesture.

But this would be a gesture at maintaining the academic freedom this university
prides use“ on. The CAFE members are in effect takinga stepforward to maintain the
freedom without which a university cannot be a center of research and learning.

Regardless of whether the CIA pays much attention to principles set down by
academians. SUNYA must adopt guidelines for dealing with potential on-campus
activity by intelligence organizations. It may be symbolic, but enough symbolic
gestures consolidate into an outcry that demands attention.

I he phrase symbolic gesture has been used in another context — on the issue of
SUNY divestment of the endowment fund stocks in corporations which do business
Willi South Africa.

SIJ NY Chancellor Clifton Wharton called divestment “a hollow symbolic gesture."
President O‘Leary is slightly more charitable. saying that because an action may have a
small eI’Icct does not mean it should not be taken. And yet O'Leary does not call for
divestment either.

I hrough all the rhetoricon divestment and all the pages detailing what a complex
issue it is. one point seems to have been lost. That point is that any company doing
business in South Africa has to abide by the rules ofthat nation. And ifthat nation says
that a black person may not hold as high a position as a white person, all the Sullivan
principles mandating equal treatment come tumbling down in a paper heap.

No matter how many stockholder resolutions are passed. no matter how many
opinions are voiced to the head of the Ford Motor Co.. the fact remains that SUNY‘s
money is in South Africa. And any business in South Africa is following the
government‘s laws and the repugnant system of apartheid.

So what if divesting ii measly seven million bucks worth of stock is a “symbolic
gesture." So what if adopting guidelines about the CIA on campus is a “symbolic
gesture." So was the Boston Tea Party.

Seemineg symbolic gestures shouldn't be discounted. An abundance of symbolic
gestures becomes not a hollow symbol but the flag of a movement. Whether that
gesttlres calls tor divestment or holding on to precious academic freedom, it is a
beginning. a rallying point. and big changes often stem from humble beginnings.
