In. Best Effort of Season,
Albany Scores 81-56 Win

by Rich Sellgson

Revenge — how sweet it was for
the Albany State basketball team
when they overwhelmed SUNYAC
foe Geneseo 81-56 Saturday night at
University Gym. Now 3-0 in the
conference. the Danes won their

'fourth consecutive game overall
tigainst no defeats.

“When they beat us last year." said
Albany guard Bill Bellamy. “they
threw it in our face afterward and it
made us really mad. that was: all we
were tnlkitig about this whole week."

Center Kelvin Jones shared his
tetimmatc‘s opinion about the
frustrating 7 l-70 loss last season — a
setback that cost Albany a share of
the SUNYAC championship with
Potsdam. “We’ve been getting up for
this all week long." Jones said. "I
asked Barry (Cavanaugb) which
game do you want the baddest. and
he said. ‘thiii one coming up.‘ It feels
rctil good to beat them by so much.“

(iencsco wasn‘t at full strength for
the contest. as they Were without
usual starting guard. George Salter.
and plttyed two‘ ailing regulars.

l-orward Mike O'Hara competed for
the first time in a week with a burn

 

    
     

Albany's Carmelo Verdelo were to the hoop for two of his 13 polnte In

ankle. while center George Brown
had so much tape on his hand and
knee that Blue Knights‘ coach Tom
l’ope said “he looked like a mummy
on the court."

Complicating Oeneseo‘s woes was
a heartbreaking dcfctit the night
before against Nazareth on a last-
sccoiid field goal. There were no
desperation shots a night latcr.
though. as the game was virtually
decided by halftime. Albany wtts
ahead 4I-24.

the Danes gaiticd an early 4-2
advantage. which they maintained
primarily by their dominance in the
rebounding department. that
ended in a 45-27 final landslide. “We
were going to the boards more." said
Albany coach Dick Sauers. “That
and. our patience were the most
improved parts in our game."

l hose two factors. in addition toa
tenacious first half defense that held
tieneseo to l9 field goal attempts
and forced them to commit to
turnovers. provided the Danes with
a significant edge. “In the first half.
both our offense and defense looked
uiibeuttiblc."siiid Ray Cesare. whose
steady play continued with l2points
