Do you remember when it was still
possible to get a brand new release from
Korveites tor $2.99? Do you remember
how Discomat used to sell all records for
53.69? Well. those days are gone, zindjust
like the twenty cent token. the five cent
ne\\spaper. and the one cent piece of
Ila/ooka bubblegum. those prices will
probably neier be seen again. But while

ong Island. Many SUNYA
students know It well. It is the
land of shopping malls.
().Il.|.‘s and beaches. Its

. inhabitants usually own
assorted "suburban musts" like two cars.
bags of lawn seed. smoke alarms and
Little League bumper stickers.

Long Island is also knovm for its many
naturaLwonders. such as the abundant
wildlife in the rural eastend and the many
dillcrcnt forms of bird. fish and plant life
along the beaches.

Tom Martello

 

lhere is one species found on Long
Island which especially deserves to be
talked about. This species has been
studied every weekday before dawn and
alter dusk. their numbers range into the
. hundreds of thousands and they cart be
: distinguished by the briefcases that
l evolution has attached to their right
upper limbs. Noted taxonomists have
classilied this species as “Commutis
Dashingus". but to Long Islanders.
they're known as Dashing Commuters.

i I be long intersession cornhined Willi a
gdesire to make sortie money to buy an
I electric typewriter brought me to a
t temporary job in New York City. It also
. brought me into direct contact with this
5 strange species of animal.

i for those non-Island folk, it is
I necessary t o explain the exact definition of
a Dashing Commuter. or DC. A DC
resides on Long Island. but worksin New
\ork City. He (or she) is transported
[tom the town of residence to the Big
Apple by a series ofchugging. noisy and
chronically late vehicles known as the
I, Long Island Railroad. A DC is notto be
1 confused with a simple "commuter", such
as one who drives to work. Simply, one
cannot "dash" in a trafficjam oﬁthe LIE.
When I arrived at the Northport
railroad station early one morning. the
l)(“s were in full force. They milled
around nervously. bearing the traditional
v‘briefcase. umbrella and morning
* newspaper.
i As I emerged from my usual morning
Ida/.e. I noticed something strange about
i the DC‘s. As if driven by some unknown
lorce. they would ritualistically look at

One morning

I noticed the
name of another railroad line I
....I could have sworn it said

"Hootcrville Express."

their watches every 30 seconds and shake
lllL‘ll‘ heads. It got kind of scary. A
hundred “C‘s scattered around the
station looking at their watches and
shaking their heads every 30 seconds.

"Round trip to Penn Station," I
mumbled to the guy at the ticket window.
and lurked over six bucks. I then looked
at uiy watch and shook my head.

A lcw tniiiutes la‘ter. thctrain lumbered
into the station. as its moose-like whistle
broke the early morning stillness. In
Northport (which is in Suffolk County)
they still use diesel trains. and some of
them are real beauties. One morning I
noticed the faded name of another
railroad line on the walls of one of the
cars. Remember. I was kind of groggy at '
that early hour. but I could have sworn it
said "llooterville Express."

llic DCs alljockeyed for position andl
climbed iitto the train. One interesting
characteristic of the DC‘s is that they all
seem to bathe themselves in the morning
with the strongest selling cologne on the
market. llie most popular is “Essence of
Accountant." which smells like a
continuation of lli-Karatc. llrut and
sauerkraut.

I sat down in my seat. all ready to
demtir the sports Monday scctioit of the
limes. All til a sudden. I found myself
pinned between two burly I)C's of about
llll)’. It was impossible to turnthe page of
the limes and fold it into the forty

‘lltotlsaild parts like other DC's did. Now I

know why the Daily News is so popular.

llte train chugged on. and I made a
latal mistake which would reveal me as
not one of the species. I tried to strike up a
conversation.

"tieez, that‘s something about the
Knicks getting rid of Spencer Haywood. -
lliink they‘ll turn around?" I asked the!
burly DC to my right. He gave mca blank
stare. I hypotliosilcd that he probably
wasn't a sports fan.

I turned my conversation to a broader
topic. "Man it's cold out therc.just like a
deep lree/e." I said to the other DC.
Another blank stare. I hypothosized that
he probably lost both of his parents in a
latal winter storm and was too choked up
to talk about it. '

lletore I could add any more pearls of
wisdom. one of the DC's head dropped. l

the other guy's hetfd dropped a few
seconds later. and before long both were
snoring away. When in Rome. do as the
burly “C's who give blank stares do. I
thought. so I dropped my head and
snored. Soon the conductor entered our
car. and | Irantically looked in every one
ol my pockets lor the ticket. The amazing
thingahout the two guys I was sitting with
was that they both were able to pull out
their tickets and hand them to the
conductor witltoul raising their heads
or skipping a snore.

lltc opposite of the two snoolcrs is the
Iatned "Commuting Speed Freak." He's

than he is in his own living room: he hangs
his coat and ltat up. s three danish and a

paper.

Another 'tamous species' is the
“Dashing Jim Brady's". those card-
earrying card players. (ict caught sitting
next to those guys and you‘re sure tosit in
Penn Station fifteen minutes after
everyone has left because they want “one
more hand“.

After a while. though. one can become
assimilated into the herds of DC‘s. Buy a
weekly ticket, drop your head and snare,
gnu hlank stares to anyone who talksand
and smell funny and you‘re sure to be
accepted. And learn how to love hating
the LIRR. You should hate to change at
Jamaica. or to wait for the train to ﬁnd a
track at Penn Station or to read about the
new'ﬁndings on ciragettes and cancer
while sitting in the smoking car.

llie DC‘s got a chance to vent their
anger one morning as the top honcho of
the LIR R. John Gabreski, rode to the city
Jlld had one of those “getting down and
talking with the commuters" sessions.
Recent newspaper articles had revealed
that the LIRR had a better track record
75 years ago than it does today. Not only
was the "on—time" record better, but the
railroad was actually faster.

(iabreski has recently taken over the
position as president, and like past
leaders. has promised to make the LIRR
the "best in the country“ — well. at least
not the worst. One ofhis ﬁrst actions was
to change the definition of “on time".
While the rest of the railroads in the
nation defined “on time" as being within
three or tour minutes of the scheduled
titne. the LI RR had deﬁned it as "ﬁve"
minutes. And they still couldn't keep par
with the others.

hour minutes, the new president
dictated. would be the new deﬁnition. He
‘ patiently listened to all of the beefs the

DC‘s threw at him in hisjourney. until the

 

 

 

 

 

train ended his misery by pulling into
|New York. It was five minutes late.
