A SELECTION OF FINE WINES
DISPENSED FROM OUR
DECORATIVE WINE BARREIS

seam

lvin Bishop rocked it less than
capacity crowd at the
Madison on January l5 to its
heart's content.

Playing with a tight band
behind him Bishop mixed his show with
tunes from his old and new albums. The
only notably absent Elvin sﬁtples were
" l'ravcllin‘ Shoes" and “Fooled Around
Arid Fell In Love." But they weren't
missed because the band more than made
tip for them in energy alone.

‘M.J._ Memmott

 

that energy exempliﬁed in the two
horn players Bishop brought along for
the ride up North. It was obviousthat
Bishop appreciated their playing even
thouin he failed to introduce them.

Standing at stage center, Bishop would
point a long finger at his sax—men to pick
out which of the boys he wanted to solo.
And solo they did. Time after time each
came through with long solos that never
tailed to hit the mark.

it Thursday January 18th

George Thorogood brought

his Dcleware Destroyers to

the Madison theatre. Opening

was a Boston-based band
tiamed Reckless. While they had good
intentions. it soon becatne obivous that
the audience was not interested in either
'their music or their antics on stage. After
"‘Frec and Iiasy." their "hit" single. the
lcrowd had had enough and wanted the
‘ Destroyers.

When 'l‘hOrOgood came on. within
minutes (despite serious‘problems with
sound) the audience was totally caught up
in his hard driving and energetic rock-
and-roll.
| He gave new life to such old songs as“lt

perfect example of Southern rock-and-

Thoro—Iu Good ,

the songs themselves were right on
target too. There was a rousing rendition
oi"‘Struttin My Stuff." and an equally up
version of “Fishin.” But the dramatic
highlight of the evening was Elvin‘s
preaching story-song titled “Pay The
Price. l‘or Feeling Nice."

With tongue firmly planted in cheek.
lilvin related to the crowd the horrors of
such evil substances as alcohol and ot.
You may feel good the night before. :lvtn
says. btit come morning you‘re going to
pay the price.

It was the climax Ofthe songthat really
made it. Using a remote plug for his
guitar. lilvin finished the tune by playing
one long solo as he walked up one aisle.
througit the lobby and down the other
aisle.

Needless to say the audience was
surprised.

Overall the Elvin Bishop show was a

roll at its best. There were great horn

solos, equally great guitar solos. and
ptently lyric: about the down-home life.

Wasn't Me" and “Johnny B. Goodc." by

 

Chuck Berry. readily admitted favorites
of l'horogood fans. To balance his show.
lliorogood mixed in his renditions of old
blues favorites such as “One Bourbon.
()ne Scotch. and One Beer" by John Less
Hooker and “Madison Blues" by Elmore
James. I

Although backed up only by a bass and
drums. lhorogood's excellence on the
lead erased the need for another guitar.
He worked hard and his guitar and
frequent juunts into the iiudicncehad
‘them hollering for more. Thorogood
finished the night with a great rendition of
"Move it On Over" by Hank Williams.

Obviously Thorogood loves to
perform. and his dynamic and exciting
style left nothing for the audience to ask
for. because its energy was spent from his
show.

n his new album. Cat Stevens
claims he is Back to Earth. as
if to say that he has been on
some journey through outer
space since the last time he
resided on this planet. And even though
Cat may feel he‘s back from his “five year
mission to boldly go where no man has

gone before." the return impresses me as a

crash landing that leaves hin ~in no solid

ground whatsoever.

lf Stevens claims he‘s coming back
virom somewhere. then he must feel that
he's been somewhere. When.cxactly.did
he Icave'.’ In I970. after a two year hiatus
Irom the studio. Cat gave us Numbers. an
album that was a departure for him in
more ways than one. First of all. it did
Iind him in outer space, in an imaginary
world revolving around characters
supposed to be the digits from one to ten.
But the departure was not only physical.
lltc sound was nothing like he had ever
given its.

With all of the changes that that album
' brought. it was still a good work. Sure it
was different. but it was also a welcome
ttetnpt at a new direction. and a
-uccessful one at that. However. poor
at ' and the lack of hit singles proved
hat the listening public didn't quite

Next came Izitm. a frenzied hop in
another direction. as different as
Nuiiibt'rx was from anything he had ever
~‘ ."donc before. Musically, it contained no
‘3‘ ’ ‘s than four songs that were clearly
I sco. a definite criteria for outer space. as
r as he is concerned anyway. Lyrically.
scented weaker than previous works.
. tc words showed a noticeable lack of
rection. which was also exhibited via its
aring title. and the sarcastic photograph
' a yo‘yo on the cover. going tip and
wn. heading nowhere.

Now. over a year and a half later. the
item album is ottt. What Cat is trying
do here is return to the days before

those experiments. why grasp for the'old
success formula once again? Is he groping
Ior music that just isn‘t supposed to be
there'.’ It's as if he‘s trying to slip right
back into the Old days. and the old ways.
But it has been four and a half years since
limit/uh am] Iht‘ Charo/ale Box. and it
just isn't that easy to do. Cat may try and
write off those years with a title like [luck
to [fur/ii. but that time has passed. and
Cat just can't produce those types of
songs anymore with the same skill. He
eatft write off his experiences.

Where. exactly. does the formula go
‘wrong on this Ll"? For one thing. these
lyrics don‘t hold a candle to the ones
lotind on "I'm: l’orl/u' Ti/It‘fltitlli or 'I‘t'user
(Hit, the Firm-(1!. two "earthy" classics.
When Cat engaged in social commentary.
as lll "Where do the Children Play" his
words Were simple but peotic sarcasm.
and \cry effective. _ Now. on a song
like "New York Times" off of the new
album. he’s writing lyrics with the same
impact of a disco track by the Village
People: New York l’oor New York/Not
lit lot a dog in New York/Just another
blackout in New York." And while earlier
('at ttcver ctnbcllished production. this
song sounds like it's tnorc overcrowded
than ruch hour subway. If that's what he
means by liar/r Io Earth. then he‘s really
oil course.

the two instrumentals on the album.
“ l he Artist" and “Nascimcnto.” are also
Iailures. mainly because Cat Stevens
Ilt'l’t'l‘ wrote melodies that had the quality
to merit not having any words. It was
always that great combination. That
great meshing of a certain tune with the
right words that created just the feeling
you wanted. On these instrumentals. you
can sense the emptiness; the need for
words. '

lyrically. the only impressive piece on
lira/t It! liurth is"Father."comingoffasa
sort ol conclusion to “Father and Son."
they are both older now. and the
generation gap that separated them then
has given way to an adult maturity: the
gap is closed: “Show tnc the way/ Before
they grind me down and bleach me
grey, Send the power not to be afraid and
when I close my eyes/ Let me see you once
in the light/ I’atlter ()h Father."

L'at Stevens may have returned to
earth. btit the problem is that he hasn't
returned to the subjects he's writing
about. [here is no immediacy in the
mttsic'. it's all been heard before. And it
il‘s all been heard before. I for
one would have most definitely prelerred
that ('at remain in outer space. waiting
Itil’ the rigltt ship to come in.
