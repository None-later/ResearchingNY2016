Labor Ain’t Labored Screw|ng 

—

Fresh from his gubernatorial victory, Governor Carey is
attempting to do the same thing he did early in his ﬁrst term: screw
SUNY. ' ‘

Carey has proposed that tuition be increased at SUNY and CUNY
by as much as $100. And it seems that the reason for this is the
Gazernor‘s slashing of the proposed SUNY budget increase by nearly
ha .

So what does this mean? SUNY will receive less money than it
needs. SUNY students will pay more money. The bargain of state-
l'unded education will start to diminish, and perhaps the quality as
well. And perhaps top-flight students will '20 elsewhere.

For SUNY students, it means further hardshipslThe ﬁnancial aid ‘
which had been increased to combat inﬂation won‘t help much now.
Add to this the strong possibility of a raise in room and board rates.
and it doesn‘t paint a pretty picture.

ln his acceptance speech at the Statler Hilton after he re-electionin
November, Carey hinted that New York State might be on the road
suck to “the days of wine and roses".

One has to wary of Carey‘s rhetoric. however. He showed
arrogance in his treatment of the student health fee:

To the Editor: i

l ant proud to report to ASP readers who
may be interested that Frank Fletcher. the
SUCIALIS’I' LABOR PARTY candidate for
Congress in the recent election for the 25th
Congressional District received. unofﬁcially,
it total of 63l votes in that district.

He received 253 in Dutchess County. 9| in

I‘ulnam. US in Westchester. and 152 here in
Ulster County. Perhaps the number may be
even more when the official tally comes out in
the middle of December.
. . - At any rate. we did make new friends as a
   result of the campaign. some of whom had
never heard of the SOCIALlST LABOR

leitlleting mostly in Dutchess and Ulster
Counties. that we got more votes there shows
that voters will vote in more numbers for the

when they rallied for a replacement oftheir antiquated gym. With this
track record, the ﬁght against budget cuts and tuition increases will be
a difficult struggle.

The health fee boycotts and protests are an example of how
students can organize and fail. When the fee was "repealed", SUNY
students gained no victory. They still had to pay the fee for another
semester (the fourth straight), and they would not get it back. As for
next year, well, we know what the Governor has in store.

Carey bullied and duped student leaders on the health fee issue.
This should serve as a lesson when approaching the current situation.
The efforts by SA, the Albany Student Uniona dn SASU are

undoubtedly Well intentioned and sincere. lf history is a yeardstick,
however, they are doomed to failure 7— it ain‘t easy to ﬁght the capital.

that doesn't mean it‘s impossible. however. So let the ﬁght begin,
and let the student bodies get involved. lfthere isn't student unity on
this issue, then there 'won’t be student unity on any issue. It's our
money. They‘re our schools. It's our battle.
