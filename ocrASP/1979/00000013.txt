“We played him pretty well."
Sauers said of Minicucci. “He played
a super game. He made some shots I
didn't think lie was capable of
making.“

It there is one money player on
()neonta's club who is capable” of
making the pressure shot. and
actually thrives on it. Ross isthe one.
His past proves it. Three times last
season. Ross‘ last—second heroics
included a shot to tie the score. a
game-winner and two winning foul
shots on another occassion.

about the Dunes' primary option.

.It was the Hamilton contest,
though. that gave Albany more than
their share of frustration. After
being narrowly defeated by the
Danes twice last season. the
nationally-ranked Division 111
Continentals came out looking for
revenge. and proceeded to stage a
dogligltt with Albany that gave all
indications that the fast-growing.
intense rivalry between these two
teams is getting stronger with each
grime. -‘ h '
the Danes opened up a 37-27
lead. and were holding Hamilton's
All—American sensation Cedric
()livcr in clteck. Averaging 23 points
per outing. Oliver could manage
only four points at intermission. The
IU-point margin and Oliver's low
scoring output took a turnaround in
the second half, as the Continentals
caught up to Albany. Cavanaugh
missed on a l0~foot jumpshot with
live seconds left in regulation to send
the game into overtime.

lhe annual balloting for Hall of
l‘uine hopefuls is probably intended
to do little more than give baseball
larts a chance to reminisce. The
unending injustice bestowed upon
the many who get rejected or else
approved by slimmer margins than
they deserve clertrly shows that the
whole process is only an attention-
geittrig hype. So. while we have
your attention. let's start at the
botiorii ol this year's list of vote-
aettcts and reminisce.

next to his name. The asterisk refers
to the fact that his 6| homers were a
reﬂection of the pitchers fear of
Mickey Mantle that year. Maris is
turtlter proof that individual
landmarks attract the writers'
attention as opposed to consistent
greatness.

Hoyt Wilhelm: He amassed I68

anyone who plays while collecting

acknowledgement.

Don Drysdale: Forget the inept
