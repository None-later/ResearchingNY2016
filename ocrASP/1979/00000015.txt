Whiit'a difference two days-and

Holiday Schedule Provides See-Saw Results

by Paul Schwinn:

iiy comparison, the Albany State
basketall squad’s 4-3 record over the
holiday break was a notable
improvement over some sub-par
performances in recent years. But
that 4-3‘ mark pales when compared
to the 7—0 record the Danes very
possibly could have emerged with.
In each of the three defeats. the
Danes new second half leads
disappear. Against a powerhouse
liamiltonttquad. Albany built upa to
point advantage. only to be caught
by the Continental» and ﬁnally
painted in overtime. 56-53.
However. Albany showed some
comeback talents of? their own by
capturing the crown in the ltlth
annuatCepital Diitrict Tournament;

held at University Gym. After
pushing aside Union. (ll-44, the
Danes erased a nine-point halftime
deficit in the championship game.
and woman Springfield 69-63. It
was Albany's ﬁrst tournament
triumph in seven years. and allows
the Danes bragging rights in the
Capital District.

“We never worked a team harder
titan i did before this tournament."
said Albany coach Dick Sauerii.
“and it paid off. We really did ajob
in the second half. We took
Springfield apart. and it was ajoy to
watch. The defense iii what won it.
and (Rob) Clone and (Buddy)
Wlekliniiiii were outstanding on
defense."

There was also enough offering ——

Carmelo Verdcjo made sure ofthttt.
the 6—4 forward posted games of l9
and 22 poiitts. was named the
tournament's Most Valuable Player.
aitd also was selected for thc
All-'l'ourncy team. Joining Verdejo
Irom Albany on the select squad
were Iiitrry Cavttnaugh and Kelvin
Jones.

. 'llte Daites‘ live-day trip to
Florida produced a sec-saw effect.
On the upswing. Albany nailed
down their first-ever victory in the
Sunshine State with an 80-63
trouncing over St. Leott. On a
deﬁnite downswing. the Danes built
up a 36-3l ﬁrst ltalf lead over tough
Division II Rollins. but that was
before the foul shooting parade
began. in the last 20 minutes, Rollins

hit on Zli of 31 free throws to come
away with it 79-70 victory.

Continuing his hot shooting.
Vcrtlejo poured iii 50 points in lltc
two southern games. and was
playing with an added incentive.
With his parents watching him pliiy
Ior only the second time. Verdcjo
tore through itssorted Florida
defenders. “i think lie was extra-
psychcd." said Situers.

Albany had little difficulty
making the switch from warm to
cold returning to University (iym to

bitrtt SUNYAL‘ opponent Buffalo. I

regained their form." Saucrs said.
“Shooting from the foul line
becomes a whole different thing
when you are under pressure. So i
didn‘t feel they needed additional
practice."

Albany was ﬂat in the beginning.
obviously owing to the emotional
drain alter the Oneonta setback.
I hey recovered midway through the
lirst hall and held a 28-26 halftime
lead. With guard Bill Bellamy keying
tltc break and Verdcjo concluding:
many dashes with layups or tip ins.
the Danes pulled awav with eight
