GOOF TO PRODUCE

Gosling-off on the job may be
good for business.

Sociologist Doctor Robert Shank
claims that when employees tell
jokes or telephone friends on
company time. their productivity
may actually increase.

Shank. who is himself a former
union organizer and plant manager.
says that limited gooﬁng-off can be
just the cure for what he calls
"worker alienation."

Shank says tltat very little can be
done to humanize assembly line

_Jtihs. but that permitting workers to
sneak away every so often to linger at
the water cooler can make a worker
happier and more productive.

announced it has adopted the new
word "bir" (pronounced “here") —-
spelled h-i-r »- for its I979 revised
edition of Managers Must Lead, a
guide to supervisory success.

Amacotn says the revised edition
oI its guide will use “hir” to replace
“he/she" and “him/her": “hirs” will
substitute for “his/her" and
"his, hers" and "hirscll" will replace
“himsell / herself."

ltut the editor (whoever “ltir” is)
seems to have had hirs problems in
coming to gripes with the problem
hirsclt.

(ialley proots ol’one chapter ofthe
icvised cdition reveal that the text
contains one “Itir.” uses "be" It)
limes. "his" twice. “men” twice.
"man" once and refers toa father-in-
liiw instead ol a person-in-Iaw.

Ihc company said it changed its
style because the women's
illtl\L‘lllt.'lll had made it aware of
stihtlc scxtsm directed at women. To
use the old stiiiidby's. “he or she" or
“his or hers." when referring to the
third person. is too wurdy and
conliisiiig. the company said.

BRAIN DRAIN
llii' 1.1m Angeli-s ’I‘i'mes is
lcptll'llttg that researchers at thc
University ol (‘aliloriiia at lrvine
studying transcendental meditation

The hull

 

 

some active

have found that regular TM

practitioners are likely to experience
a 65 percent increase in the flow of
blood to the brain.

Such an increase. according to the
researchers. could well explain the
increased clarity of mind and mental
powers commonly claimed by
practitioners of TM.

l M practitioners reportedly place
themselves in another state of
consciousness. other than waking or
dreaming. by concentrating on a
specitic thought or sound called a
"mantra."

the study involved to men, all of
whom had practiced TM for at least
li\c years. In past research. the UC
lr\ine team has found that 'I‘M
markedly reduces the level of stress
experienced by those who meditate.

UNSOCIAL SUBURBS

Moving to the suburbs for the
sitkc ol the kids may not be such a
good idea.

l-dward Wynne. an associate
protcssor ol education at the
lliii\crsily ot Illinois. says the
suburbs may be harmful to children
because they provide a “world of
piotccted alllucncc."

Wynne claims the isolation ofthe
siihiirbs can prolong immaturity and
pt'c\clll children from learning
necessary coping skills. He says this
isolation can lead to anti-social
behavior such as suicide. drug abuse
and delinquency.

l/llllltlll Behavior magazine
quotes Wynne as saying. “the
maturing process requires a great
\iii'icty ot experiences with? people
li-om diverse socio-economic
backgrounds. Suburban youngsters
are not likely to get that range of
experience in the homogeneous
suburban environment.

KILLER COASTER
A group of medical researchers is
\viit'tii ng that a thrilling. scary ride on
it roller coaster can be fatal.

Researchers at the University of
South Florida College of Medicine
report they measured the heart rates
of to healthy volunteers as they rode
a plunging roller coaster known as
the “Python” at a Florida
amusement park.

The doctors say ' they were
surprised to discover that the
heartbeat rates increased to an
average of I38 beats per minute, with
one volunteer showing an incredible
I70 beats-per-minute rate.

I he researchers saythat stress and
increased heart rate caused by the
ride is enough to trigger heart
attacks in many people. particularly
those with had hearts or pregnant
thIl’lL‘ll.

ZEPPELIN TOUR

alter spending three weeks in
Stockholm. where members
recorded their new L.l’. at a studio
owned by the Swedish group Abba.

It is not known if Led Zeppelin

rumors ol such a tour are circulating.

APETIGHT

Medical researchers at the
Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor.
Maine. say they have accidentally
discovered a chemical compound
that could Iwaomc a sort of miracle
diet pill.

Doctor Andrew Kandutsch says
that lab researchers were attempting
to develop a chemical to control
cholesterol levels in the body. but
instead came up with one that
apparently suppresses the appetite.

The doctor says that whenthe new

substance is fed to lab animals. they
lose their desire to eat. Animals
given large doses of the drug.
Kandutsch says. will actually choose
to become gaunt and starve to death
rather than eat. Smaller doses
reportedly cause them simply to eat
less than normal.

Kandutsch says it will be some
time belore the drug can be tested on
human volunteers.
