l'otsdam‘s men's SthmIng team
took tlte New York State title last
year and they are slightlyannoyed at
tltetr mediocre showmg this year
which saw them carrying a l~4 dual
meet mark into Saturday‘s meeting
inth Albany State. Against the
visiting Danes. Potsdam sought to
turn the season aroumi abruptly.
"No doubt tltey were up for us‘and
they wanted to beat us solidly," said
[\Ihany coach Ron White. “They
were really out to nail us as i could
tell by the intensity they showed and
the exceptional early-season times
they turned in.“
lhe Danes proved to be polite

guests as the sullcred under their I

worst loss of the season in a 77-36
l'ulsdam triumph. Many ofthe races
were lairly close and White said the
tally was not indicative of the
dillerence between the two squads.
.\t.‘\L'Illlt.'lcss. Albany suffered its
initial setback ol the season and

returned home with a 2-1 record.

“I” Derkash. who started slowly
atop the diving boards. has begun to
churn ottt winning dives with
regularity and he led the limited
Dane attack by taking both the one
and three meter diving events. In the
one meter competition he recorded a
personal best ol 208.25 points and
added 200.351roin the higher board
to garner a career high 408.60

Negative Factors Add UP.
In Women Swimmers Loss

by Janet E. Ce‘mr

llte loss of many strong
swnnmcrs. and only one and one-
hall weeks of practice were factors
which Coach Deb Fitzdam cited in
Albany State‘s women‘s swimming
and diving team‘s loss to Hartwick
L‘ollege by an 89-38 score Saturday
in Unconla.

Freshman Monica Rossi was the
only swimmer able to muster ﬁrst
place ﬁnishes for Albany as she took
tlte 200 and' SOD-yard freestyle
etents. She failed. however. to
qualin Ior stale competition with
her time at 0122.6 in the 500.
although l'itrdatn noted that there
are several mccts remaining in the
team‘s schedule in which Rossi could
lower her time. Diver Charlene
it‘huek) (iriswald snared the team‘s
Iliiid Iirst place linish with her
uncontested dives from the tltrec
inelci board.

swimmers, most notably freshman

record-holding l'rosh team and a

who will be lost for the remainder of
the season.

Coach Fitzdam also cited the
Danes‘ limited practice time art a
lactor m the loss. She said: “We only
had lands tor part of the team to
practice here during the last week of
the vacation and the team as a whole

has only been practicing a week and‘

one ltull while llartwick has been
back longer and it showed. We are
improving though.“

Second place finishes were the
Dame‘s lavoritc positions on
Saturday as evidenced by Barb Van
