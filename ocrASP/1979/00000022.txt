Albany State‘s women‘s
gymnastics team hosted its ﬁrst tri-
meet at the season and sent guests
Ithaca College and the University of
Vermont home with lll.8 and
l0tl.l5 points respectively, while the
Danes could only manage 33.25
points. their IOWest total in three
years.

Luach I’at DuvaI-Spillttne
commented. "It was a very bad day.
Last year we neVer scored Iowerthan
the 90‘s and at the States‘ we had l09
points. I think the very long break
played a role in the loss. although I
didn't realy expect so few points
because in practices We have looked
\cry good. I guess some days arejust
oll days I‘ve never seen the girls
have so many falls all the balance
beam." Captain Cindy Cobane and
tortimc I’alma were among the
Ditties who encountered trouble on
the beam.

hplIItlllL‘ did poirtt out sevcrttl
bright spots iii the loss. Freshman
Lattrtc Vetii had a personal
breakthrough with her vaulting

score (II 5.05. which was high enough
to count toward the team total.
because in'scoring meets. only the
tour highest scores of six team
competitors are counted. Kathy
L'ogmolti gained a (L9 in the floor
exercise. and according to Spillane.
showed that her new routine would
totally be accepted after several low
ti's III a previous meet and scrimage.
Iiat'littrti Shaw had it "respectable"
5.35 with her routine on the uneven
parallel bars. which was the Danes'
high score iit that event. “They just
weren‘t httting."said Spillane.
Senior Itarbara I'lummel‘s floor
routine scored a 5.75 and Spillane
said. “I was glad. She deserves the
recognition. especially in her last
season of cortipetition. She has a
very unusual roittitte with a lot of
dance and not a lot of difficult
humbling. It was nice to see that the
Judges ttpprcciatcd her work."
Spillane noted it change in the
scoring system this season because
tittiny ol the area's collegiate and
Itigli school meets are now being
scored on a 0-9.2 scale vs, the 0-100

Gymnasits Fall Short In Tri-Meet ‘

actlIL'. Ilie new scale has a ROV
tactot' which cart be added to the
total total. ROV being an
anacronyrn lor Risk. Originality.
and Vtruosity.

"this is good." said Spillane.
"because the score now takes all the
Iatciors in a routine into
consideration, It will also hopefully
do away with the great disparity
which had existed for so long
between high school and collegiate
scoring. where it girl could go from
tccctvtnr.I 7‘s and 8‘s iii high schoolto
In and 5's in college. Now the
scoring system won't have to be
changed again arid this is also easier
to understand."
