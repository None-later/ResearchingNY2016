As Offensive Display Buries C. W. Post

by Paul Schwartz

hurry Cuvanitugli has scored more
points in one game than the 34 he
totaled for Albany State Saturday
night. And his to rebounds was nota
personal best either. But what wasm
outstanding about his performance
against C.W. Post was tltat for 40
minutes. ltc dominated the action
completely a one-man barrage
that cut through. around. and over
the otermittchcd l’ionecr defenders.

lhc domination began early.
Scoring on two layups. two tip-ins
and a 20 foot jumpshot in the
operrrrig scveti‘miiiutes. Cavanaugh
quickly established hittisclf as the

inside force against the Pioneer man-
toanan defense; he ttlso caused Post
coach Stun Kellncr to call a near-
despiiration time out. The Danes led
17-5. and. with ttrt offense that wrts
operating at it‘s fast-breaking best.

Vii-77.

“I thought this would be a much
tougher ballgamc." said Albany
conch Dick Situers. “and I'm pleased
by the victory margin. l'his was our
best offensive effort of the season.
and tile best tlting about it was that
e\cryone was sri unselfish."
