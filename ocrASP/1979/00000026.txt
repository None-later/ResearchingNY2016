Interviewed want to quit using the
pep pills. but are afraid they can't
because they might lose a
"competitive edge“ to other players
who use the pills.

Mttndcll predicts that widespread
pill use will continue in pro football
until the league publicly
acknowledges it has a problem. and
sets up It monitoring system where
no competitive edge could be
allowed.

FAT CHANCE!

Hold on to your pauttcbes men

. Itll is becoming fashionable.

At least this is according to the
turn t‘ompauy. one of Ilritaitt‘s
biggest shirt makers.

Ict'u says it surveyed It ttuntbcr of
lirttish women on their tastes itt men.
.Ilill louud that the bettnpoie look is
dcltmtely out this season.

E EWS

icrn says the survey showed that
while just one in every five women
polled found skinny men attractive.
34 percent said they preferred men to
have It suggestion of It tummy, and
.1] percent sttid they actually
preferred a slight paunch.

Dick Hawland. the firm's
ItIIIntIging director said the results of
his poll don‘t mean it's fashionable
to be fat. but he added “a minor
pauneit which is still under control
seems to appeal to women.“

When does a minor paunch get
ottt ol‘eontrol. you might ask. Well.
according to Howland. it's when you
can‘t see your feed when you stand
uptight; it you can’t see your belt
when you sit down: if youean't Iettn
lorward without bursting your sltirt
buttons. and if you can't tie your
shoe laces “without finding It middle
region obstruction."

The American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics. a
sortiety of 27,000 aerospace
engineers. scientists and students.
has recommended that the federal
government spend some $30 million
in ii research and development
program for It solar-powered space
satellite that would beubout the size
of Manhattan.

The satellite. according to the
institute, could be collecting solar
energy thousands of‘milcs away in
space ttnd transmitting enough by
laser beam to meet almost all the
electric power needs of New York
Ctty.

I he group said that therc was little.
question that the satellite concept
could be implemented. butthcrc was
one major drawback _— the cast.

Accordingtosotnecstimates.such
II solar system could run to Its high as
soil billion.

the Society also warned that there
mold be possible environmental
hazards Irom space-based lusch or
IIIIcroIvIIves. attd that the system
Ingltl even be captured'or held
..Insotn by an unfriendly nation.

Members ol the Society are
ptedtcttng that if the results of
