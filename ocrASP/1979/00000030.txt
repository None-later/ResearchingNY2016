"pin The sir... 
It's Superman!

irst there was Superman. the

comic book which begat

Superman. the movie serial

which begat Superman, the

television show which begat
Superman. the cartoon. And now. for
those of us who haven‘t'had enough,
there‘s Su erman the movie.

Ben Gable

l have managed over the years to see all
oi the various Supermans including Dan
Ayki'oyd‘s Uberman last Saturday night.
My iiivorite was always the television
Superman as played by George Reeves.
and still running in syndicati n on
stations all over America. The comic
book Superman was too unreal for my
tastes. the villains were too fantastic and
plots were science fiction. The television
Superman, on the other hand. battled
ordinary every-day gangsters. Mugs who
robbed bariks or jewelry stores or
kidnapped Miss Lane and Jimmy Olsen.
lliat happened a lot. 'l'rue some of the
plots were a hit unrealistic. notably
anything invented by Prof. l’crrywiiiklc
or the one when the crooks ttirii invisible.
yet these shows were always done with
toiigtie liriiily placed in cheek.

llicii. ol course. the characters on the
tclcirsion show were so lovable. Who
could lorgct l’cri'y White‘s famous:
"Don't call me cliicl“ or Lois' remarks
about L'lark Kent‘s manhood. etc, The
show certainly didn't have terrific special
cilccis. btit after all it was camp!

So what if you, saw the strings that
carried Superman on his flights. So what
ll cyery time he ran iiitoaiialleytocliangc
clothes they tised the saute clip of film.

Hits of cotirse brings us to the new
Superman, No strings were seen here,
aiicr all. this is the Star Wars generation
oi Iilin making. And the spectal effects
were indeed terrific. The ilying sccncs
oci'c marvelous as were depictions of
earthquakes and strange crystal
toi motions troni the planet Krypton.

Yet. I believe that the film‘s major
faults (as well as its achievements) lie
w itlirii this realm. While the special effects
were well done. I think that the producers
ol Superman allowed the liliii to be
consumed liy them. The character
tlL'\L'ltip|llL'llt which was so well done

 

 

twenty years ago with the television show
was greatly lacking in the movie. Instead
the production became a showcase for
Superman‘s miraculous abilities as
portrayed by the special effects. The
cliaracters'oi~ the Daily Planet were there
but without true import. Perry White was
wasted as a source of interest or even
humor. This is not to say that the
producers missed all of the possibilities
tor camp that were available. There were
laughs in this movie.

the big disappointment for me.
therefore. was that so much time (it is a'
very long movie) was spent trying to
"cover" all of Superman‘s abilities at the
expense of some real character
development. If you think back. you‘ll
remember that on the old television show.
most ol'tlie scenes featured Clark. Jimmy.
Lois. and Perry. in this Superman. thei
lirst hour was spent on the planet.
Krypton and riiost of the next two liottrs
dealt 'with a display of Superman‘s
abilities or l.cx l.titlior‘s cvil.

l'art oi the prohlcrii is oi‘course mine]
did enter the theater with certain
expectations. many of which were not
met. for instance. i missed thetratlitional
"look tip in the sky. . .“ Yet | tliiriktliat
iliose expectations were reasonable and
that many others who grew tip with the
iclci isioii Superman will be disappointed
with Superman. the movie.

llie plot of the movie is basically fun.
Although the scenes on Krypton were a
bit slow. i especially liked the scenes with
tilenn land as Superman‘s “father” in
kansas, Christopher Reeve wasjust fine
as Superman and Margot Kidder played
a liberated Lois Lane. Jackie Cooper was
lorgettuble as l’crry Wliitc since the role
really meant little to the plot. As far as
Marlon lirando is concerned. lcotild only
keep asking myself why the best actor in
America and one oftlic fittest in the world
would make a fool of himself for a riicre
three million or so. It's not that lirantlo
was bad. litit the role was just so silly. .

All things considered, Superman is an
entertaining movie. i do however. look
toruard to the sequel, which i understand
has been shot already. i hope that the
producers were happy with the special
cliccts ol Superman l. and are willing to
saci'ilicc some action for some interest.

“Heads First"

ltliotigli l'lic Babys have been

around for less than three

years they have managed to

develop a very unique and

_a|ready the proverbial ‘siiigle'. is a nice
upbeat number reminiscent of “Isn‘t it

strong llabysctit on side one in which lead

throughout all of the cuts a fresh
