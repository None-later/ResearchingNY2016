0: Wilt) do you think is the best in
the rriig iit all divisions overall
today'.’ ‘
A: When I look at achampioninany‘
held as being good or great I take
everything and put it into one. With
a boxer I don't look at who is the best
physically. I look at his personality
and ltow does he act under pressure.
How does he act when someone
ollers him a lot of money to take a
name and it may bear bad movie and
l look at wltat kind of commercials
he‘s doing. How is ltis morals. ltowis
ltts religion. does he pray? I put all
that together aitd that's how I rank
my people. not just the fighters. I.
don't know what they'd do if they
laced a lot ol pressure. ltad to go to
the Army and he thought it was
wrong. would he have the nerve to
stay out give up all this money and
go tojatl or die if he had to.

All that I take iii and that‘s wliyl

entitled " I lie littoxicatioris of Life."
iou never heard the likes of it itt
yorir lile. il'sjust as supreme as my
body. I'm a srtpretiie lecttirer atttong
lecturers.

Rolls Royees. two homes each worth
‘) million . I owe sontcthing to the
people. the people made me. the
people bought tickets. And I‘m
goriinr give it to them. My life is now
dedicated to humanity and peace.
and ltll' doing all I can to bring
nations together.

0: \\liy don‘t other celebrities use

 

their status to better mankind?

Az‘l'hat‘s because they don't have the
mentality. I‘ve been studying to bee
black Muslimsinee I962. 'Ihttt‘it why
I didn‘t go to Vietnam or jail. Did

. you know I didn‘t go to jail or the

Army? That‘s because the Supreme
Court says. “he is 'a minister." This
part I never revealed to you because I '
was clowning and making money.
Saying. "I‘m the prettiest. I‘m the
greatest." Fighting Frazier on the

' lloor rassling. this is to make money .

But the real Muhammed Ali you

v don't know. People are shocked

when I start talking, people who
understand knowledge and wisdom.
they are completely surprised.

Q: Does All have personality/'2

A: Wltat. are you the local Howard
L‘osell'.’ Of course I have personality.
that‘s why I ltave suclt a following.l
have ittore than boxing. They follow
me because I hiive personality. lt
nn't because l‘iti a good boxer. l
narer heat I~'ra/.ier. I barely got past
Norton twice. I barely got past
Splitks. It ain‘t that. it‘s the
IllL‘lIlillil)’. lltey can‘t talk to you.
Ain't no boxer can come in here and
talk to you like this. What‘s .loe
l'I'II/IL‘I‘ gonna talk about. what‘s
Spinks tll‘ Norton gonna talk about?
I'm a world mart artd I know it and
I'm pretty. Just look at me.

Q: How about when you retire,
who‘s gonna be_ the next
heavyweight champ? ‘

A: I don't know. That was bigto me
llIt.‘II but it‘s small to me now. Boxing
is good. been good to me. uiid I
couldn't do Without it. I encourage
all young boys who can do to do it.
llut uhal I‘m doing now Idon‘t have
time to worry about who is the next
