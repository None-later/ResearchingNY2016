ll members of the Union College
basketball team studied the statistic

night. they would probably be
pleased. It showed that the
Dutchriien did what they had set out
to do against the visiting Albany
hllllt: Lire-at Dimes — play a slow
tempo ballgame. keep the score
down. iirid control the Dane running
game. And with another glance. the
stat sheet admitted that Union
totaled 27 baskets made. compared
in tlic skimpy lti scored by Albany.

I he one column. however. that‘s
labeled l‘ | .\t-A proved to be
t iiroii's downfall. With Albany
going to the lotil line 38 limes. and
hitting on .17 of those attempts. the
other statistics could be discarded.
llre liiiiclinren would definitely not
be pleased witli this statistic: The
final score. Albany 63. Union 60.

Depth May' Give Spihers Finest Squad Ever

by David Osborn

If all .variables fall into place. the
harder they come. the harder they
may indeed fall before the Albany
State men's volleyball team this
season.

"We ccrlairrly have the capability
to beat every team on our schedule
this year if we play up to otrr
potential.“ said Dane coach Ted
Larl. beginning his fourth ycarat the
helm. "We're so deep that loan insert
i irtualfy any of our f2 players at any
irriic and not be losing anything on
the court."

With to players returning from
last year‘s f'inc 12-8 squad and two
new frosh additions. Earl says this
should be his finest team ever at
Albany. 'fhey‘ll start to truly gauge
their prowess tomorrow when the l9
game schedule begins with it trip
down to Nyack for a tri-mcet with
the frosts and Queens College.

"In volleyball maturity on the
court is very important. since a
coach only has two 30-sccond
timeouts to call dtiring an entire
match." Larl explained.“'|'hey have
to be able to make decisions out on
the court together. So this extra year
that they now have as a unit should
make quite a difference."

ltarl has not yet decided on a
starting six. but leading the
entourage of returnccs arc co-
ciiptairis Andy Kinstler and Rob
Harrington. At 5-4 with a solid
frame. Harrington. a junior, is the
shortest man on the squad and also
possibly the top setter. “lie hits all
the skills and just hicks the height."
fzarl said.

Kinstler is a tiid under six-feet.
and one of the top hitters on the
team. Albriny hopes to display ii
solid offense and a capable defense
with John Vergo doing most of the

savrng and picking off of spiked
balls. but the Danes will rely hciivily
on the serve. liric Stern. a senior. is
currently the top server.

“I worked on my serve really hard
last year in the beginning of practice
and I might have liiida littlcjump on
the rest of the guys." Stern said.
"Last year I was working on several
difficult serves. iirid with a lot of
practice i got them down. But
cicrybody serves wcll onthc whole,"

With ii strong serve. the Danes can
force the opposition into a weak
return. take control of the point
immediately iind then set up their
front-row hitters. Up front. Albany
