BET ON G‘OLD
Singer Bette Midler disclosed
earlier this year shesigned a contract
tor a European tour that required
she be paid in gold. rather than in
dollars.

l'he Divine Miss M admitted she
was losing faith in the sinking dollar.
and asked that she be paid in 3.524
one-ounce gold coins instead of
5600.000. Midler's request has
apparently paid off.

‘Ihe New York Daily News reports
that gold coins are already worth‘
more than $700,000 and are still
climbing in value. Midler can cash
them in today for a proﬁt of more
than “00.000.

Midler. incidentally. invested her
money in South Africa’s gold coin.
the kruggcrand. a coin that is being
boycotted by many international
opponents of the South African
government.

BRUTAL NITRATE

ihe Federal Government is
preparing to crack down on the legal
marketing of “butyl nitrate". a
substance which users inhale to
experience a “90-second high.“
. Doctor Charles Sharp of the
.\at|onai institute on Drug Abuse
reports that the Food and Drug
.\tlltltlttsiriiil0n. the Consumer

agency are studying possible
controls o'ier the currently-legal
substance. .

Iiutyl nitrate is an oil-like liquid
that is also known by such names as
popper-s. rush.jock orjockaroma. ii
In most often sold as room

found "that the frequency of
hysterectomies performed in the
U.S. is linked more to the
availability of insurance coverage
than the need for the operations.

lhc O'l'A says that there were no
icwer than 678.000 hysterectomies
periormed in the U.S. in l976. and
that the rate is climbing. The.oii'toe
predicts that eventually more than
half the female population in
'America will have their ateruses
removed by the age of 65.

ihe office says. however. that it
has found that the procedure is often
prescribed when it is not really
necessary. especially if the patients
have insurance coverage. The
rperaiion costs over $2000.

ihe death rate. incidentally. for

r A study of ‘36 cheerleaden by
Doctor James Case. a professor of

them have experienced some vocal
damage.

Case says his diagnosis uncovered
such problems as the swelling of

I DEATH TRAP

A study by at UCLA research
team has found that the death rate
dropped significantly during a
doctora' strike in Los Angeies in
i976.

the author of the study. Doctor
Milton Roemer. says that the
average weekly death rate duringthe
strike declined from l9.8 death to
lol deaths per i00.000. a decline of
nearly 20 percent.

Roemer suggests that fewer
people tired during the strike mainly
because patients delayed or
permanently cancelled undergoing
non—emergency surgery procedures.

Roemcr says it appears that
thousands of Americans are dying
prematurely after undergoing
needless operations.
