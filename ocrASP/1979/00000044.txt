It took the talents of seven
newcomers. but finally. after a six
year wait and many trying
circumstances. Albany State again

has a wrestling team with a winning '

record.

In order to achieve that goal the
Danes laid to stage a rally of sorts as
they entered Saturday‘s four-way
competition at University Gym with
a 7-9 mark. Powered by the triple
\iUltH'tcs oi l’tiiil Hornbach. I’etc
loporowski and Steve Bertrand.
Albany swept all tiiree of their
opponents to finish dual
coiiipetitton wtth tin ll-9 ledger.

llie Danes handled Kings Point.
ANS. and Norwich. 49-6. rather
easily. llie real test came in the finale
when a poised and vigorated Albany
squad dealt Division II Central
Littlll. a surprising 25-l9 upset
delcttt. Ron Van Antwerp, one of
seteti lresliitten stitrtcrs. brought
home the triumph with a 5-I decision
at Nil that clinched the win.

“Our guys wrestled just
unbelievably." said Dane assistant
eoitcli Iirad Hamer. “Before the
Central Conn. tnateh we told them
they had to wrestle ‘like you know
you can but haven't so far this year.‘
ilicy responded perfectly."

Itornbach is a soph who
traiislerred to Albany from lndiana
University and had to wait the
mandatory period of inelligibility
helore wrestling on January I. Since
then he has compiled a line l2-l-l
record itiid along with Steve
ltcririiiid, who owns a l3-4 mark.
Iiiiic been Albany‘s top wrestlers.

Against Central Conn.. the final
ol lliree meets for the Danes as
determined by lot. Albany was pitted
With a ioriiitdable power that often
places wrestlers in the New England
Lliiiiiipioiiships. Early in the

program. lierti‘aiid scored a 9-6
decision over Spotter to boost the
Danes ahead.

loporowski. who won by a

dciiiitlt and a l'orfcit iii his two

previous matches. pinned his
Central Conn. lot: at [42 after 3:”
had elapsed. Another frosh,
loporowski has been nagged by a
wrist injury that showed not to be
broken but caused consistent pain.
itis showing on Saturday settled his
tinal record at 54.

At l5tt. Hornbach took two
lopsided decisions over Kings Point
and Norwich entrants. and then
rounded out his afternoon by
scoring a convincing l7-8 win over
L'entral L'onn.'s Smith. in the
previous match, Albany‘s Mike
(it'cco had been pinned by Salge. a
I)”. ll All-American last season.

the Ditties were leading 22-l5 in
the team count when Van Antwerp
look the that against Central Conn.'s
Leonard wnh Albany needing a win
to wrap things up. They got it with
\an Aiitwcrp‘s S-l decision. Kings
Point and Norwich only entered . ‘
partial squads iind the numerous
iorleit giveaways by both schools
gave the Danes an easy time.
