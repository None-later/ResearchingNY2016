SUN Y Room Rent Hike Possible

by Aron Smlth

SUNY students may find a 550
increase in dormitory room rents on
their bills next fall. according to
Assemblyman Mark Sicgel (D«
Manhattan).

This announcement comes just
weeks after Governor Hugh Carey
recommended that SUNY raise its
tuition charge by SIOO per student
annually. According to Sicgcl. a
room rent increase might be a more
desirable alternative to it tuition
incretise. Sicgcl emphasized that
Carey's rccommcndation does not
automatically pass a tuition incrcnsc
into law.

While Sit:ch pinpointed ti room
riite increase as the most likely
substitute for the controversial r
tuition increase. he was quick to add
that it remains only one of many
possibilities. An increase in the price
of another student service. such as
the food or health services provided
at campuses throughout SUNY.
would serve as well. he said.

However. ttccording to Student
Association of the State University
(SASU) Executive Vice President
Ed Rothstcin, it is quite possible that
SUNY students will be subjected to
both a tuition increase and a room
rent increase in 1979-80.

«1‘ I.

 

Prosldcnt O'Loary will serve on a commlttee studyth
New York callno gambltng.

“You can't really compare the
two," snid SUNY Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Ronald Bristow. “While part of our
total budget, the two are budgeted
separately. The income and
expenditures for residence hall
operations is considered it separate
entity. All this tics in with
construction bonds. Our academic
facilities are bonded through the
State University Construction Fund.
Our residential facilities are funded
by the [New York State] Dormitory
Authority."

Unless somc.sort of rate hike is
imposed upon students. SUNY will
be unitblc to make necessary repairs
and replacements of equipment next
year, according to Bristow. Since
these repairs and replacements are
needed both in academic buildings
and wittiin student residence
complexes, some justification for
raising both tuition and room rents
may exist. Funds are not normally
transferred bethm thc Dormitory
Authority and the Construction
Fund. said Bristow.

While Carey's Executive Budget
was released last week. SUNY‘s
requested increase over last year's‘
figure was slashed from
approximately $78 million to $32

    
   

wow i '

(Photozﬂoanne Kulakott)

million. According to Bristow.

nciirly l2 percent ofthc $46 million ,

difference was to cover equipment
repair and replacement.

Excrting an equally pressing
demand on SUNY funds are
construction bonds. said Brisiow.
At the forefront of SUNY‘s goals is
the “bonding out” ofconstruction by
l980. he said. This is it process
involving the transfer of short-term
loans to long-term loans. one which
can occur if backed up by sufﬁccnt
guarentced funds. Hence. SUNY
seeks additional revenue from its
students. to insure that the
changeover takes place.

According to Bristow. such
projects as the construction for
SUNY‘s Utica/Romc Upper
Division College will not be included
in the bond transfer.

"We're not talking about new
construction; we‘re talking about
long-term bonding. " said Brictow.
“Facilities that are already built or
are under construction already that
are on short-term bonds should be
transferred over to long-term
bonding arrangements. but
basically. we're talking about bonds

. Panel Studies Casino Gambling

'by Matthew Cox

SUN YA President Vlnccnt
01an will serve on a panel created
this week to advise the governor how
casino gambling should be operated
in New York State.

Gov. Hugh Carey's schedule calls
for the panel‘s preliminary findings
to be available in April. when the
state Senate and Assembly can
presumably also consider them.”
the legislature acts before summer
on one of the three casino gambling
bills it approved last year. the issue
could be the subject of a state-wide
voter referendum its early as this
November.

The panel will study the question
of whether casinos in New York
State should be owned by the state or
by private corporations which the
state would license and regulate. It
will recommend its findings to the
governor and suggest among other
things. ways of preventing organized
crime from involving itself in the
industry.

Casino gambling could earn ihe
state substantial dollars. in Atlantic
City. New Jersey. for example.
where the privately-owned ﬁrm of
Resorts international operates
casinos under a temporary state
license. New Jersey has taken eight
percent. or St 1.8 million dollars. of

,. the corporatin's gross income since it

opened eight and one-half months
ago.

Carey has said he prefers public
ownership of casino gambling. by
which the state could earn an even
larger portion of profit. His
Executive Order establishing the
panel instructs it to find “the most
beneﬁcial ways of utilizing casino
gambling for cconotnic
development."

"Casino gambling in New York
State lttis attriictive potential for

economic development and job

creation." the governor's statement
announcing the panel said. “it must
be structured properly. so that we
ctitt derive the greatest benefit."

Social Welfare Dean Resigns; Search Begins

by Charles Bell

SUNYA will be seeking out it new
Dean for the School of Social
Welfare in the wake of current Dean
Seth Spellmttn'ti decision to resign.
Spcilmitn said that his reason for the
decision was that he Wits “tired of
administration".

Spcltman. who was Deiin of the

ow terminated James Allett
Collegiate Center before his two year
service with Social Welfare said. "l
have been in Administration ttcrc itt
SUNYA for ten years. and I'm tired
of the hassles of paperwork.”

Vice President for Academic
Affairs David Martin said that it
search committee to recruit
candidates for a new Dean iii now
being formed. Martin met with
faculty members of the School of
Social Welfare and requested that

they submit nominations for
membership on the search
committee.

"We try to have it broad

representation of the committee.
though there are no sci guidelines."
said Martin. Members of the
School's faculty. the SUNYA Dcttn'u
"'iuncil. students and outside
:ttlty will make uptlic membership
;' the group. Martin iiddcd tttttt
genus: of the numerous contacts
between Social Welfare and the
outside cotitntitnity. some “outside
.mprcscttltllitilt" will be included on
the committee.

Mtirtin said that he knew of no
otltcr retiiiou titan the one cited by
Spellmtin for the resignation. _

“Hill tcrtn tut dean was it good per-
iod for Social Welfare." Martin-Id.
“During tlitit time the school

satisfactorily underwent ii
rcuccreditation. new faculty
members were hired. and I! proposal
for it doctoral program got‘
underway.“

Assistant Dean Edmund Sherman
said that the faculty response to
Spettmitn's notice ofrctiignntion was .
“regret that he wasn't staying on
longer." ‘

“Our enrollment went up during
his terttt as Dean“ Sherman said.

Spellmun said that he has agreed
to stay on as Dean until tltc search
committee has cotne tip with it
replacement.

Martin said tltitt the search
procedure iii ti lettgtltly one. “I ltope
thlt within it few weeks we'll have
the search committee together. it is
very important that. we get the

advertisements for the positions into
national journals soon."

He added that the upcoming review
ofthe proposed doctoral program in
Social Welfare and several

"I'Maki'ng cdsl‘rto gambling“legal

constitution. so theisaucmuat be put
before the state's voters as a
referendum. Beforethat can happen.
both separate chambers in two
separate legislature sessions. must
pass a bill proposing that this be
done. Three bills passed last year.
each specifying n-diffcrcnt form of
casino gambling. will allow the
legislature this session to decide
which version to present to voters.
O‘bcary will serve on the l2-
membcr panel along with three
professors from other New York
State universities and actor James
tiarl Jones. They are Lynch, the
chairman. who, like O’Lcary.
continues to bc a faculty member of
his school's criminal justice college
while also serving the larger
university its an administrator; Roy
Kapltin, Associate Professor of,
Sociology at SUNY at Buffalo; and
Mona Miller. Professor at Cornell
University‘s state-funded School of
industrial and Labor Relations.
Lynch. who said public hearings
on the issue will be held in Albany
and around the state. refused to say
if he fttvorcd one form of casino
operation over another. He denied
that his panel was being appointed
by Carey to “drum up" the issue so
legislators would be sure to act in
time for it fall referendum.

upcoming national ‘" in
the field will be factors in
encouraging the administration to
act promptly on search for it new
Dean.

According to Martin. there are
now fotir other Dctin searches going
on. Committees are currently
looking for Deans for the Schools of
Education. Social and Behavioral
Science. Science and Mathematics
