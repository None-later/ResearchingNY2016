here are times, in a musical
artist‘s career progression,
when a listener can hear a new
record by an artist, and
immediately sense a drastic
change in style, for better or for worse.
One can feel when an artist has come out
with a record that is clearly a gigantic step
upward; a personal artistic achievement.
Such is the feeling 1 experienced from my
-very ﬁrst listen of Armed Forces, the
brand new Elvis Costello record, and
undoubtedly,’one of the ﬁnest albums to

appear in a long while.
Jay Gissen

Elvis Costello has had the sameband
for all three of his albums, and Nick Lowe
has been the producer throughout. Yet,
on this LP, Elvis has transcended himself
completely; the album is a ﬂawless
display of sound recording. The melodies
are astoundingly good, and each tune
reaches out and grabs you in such a way
as l have not felt in a longtime. The lyrics
are his best ever —- bitineg cynical,
sarcastic. humorous. and dangerous
words for today’s world. The production
is utterly innovative. Nick Lowe seems to
have made maximum use of his studio
skills, creating tremendous feelings with
some expert mixing. And the band, Steve,
Bruce and Pete, seems to be perfeme in
harmony with the musical goals Elvis is
pursuing. And on top of all that, thecover
is a striking piece of modern art.

Although l deplore the use of such
undeﬁnable terms as “punk rock," or
“new wave,” Elvis Costello's ﬁrst two
albums, My Aim is True and This Year's
Model, both seem to have been placed in
one of those two categories. Both of those
albums are excellent, and hint toward
what was to come.

On My Aim 1: True, his highly
acclaimed debut LP, the music possessed
a raw quality about it; the production was
very simple, the songs were all very short
and up front pieces, and the lyrics were
potent. But people who were willing to
give the album a listen found that the
tunes they ltcard had a crude catchiness to
them; they stuck out in your mind. You‘d

ﬁnd yourself humming them all day if you
had just played the record.

Elvis followed this up with This Year's
Model, another excellent album, but not
that giant step upward he has now
achieved. The songs on- this album
seemed a little less hummable, but by the
same token, they were a little less raw too.
Nick Lowe was hinting towards a more
elaborate production, and to Costello
fans, the album was by no means a let
down in any way.

And now. all of a sudden, Armed
Forces is here. The original title had been

 

Emotional Fascism, but CBS records
initiated a change. they too must have,
sensed the sales potential of this
masterpiece, and for purely commercial
reasons, asked for a “lighter” title. in fact,
they are promoting this album heavily,
and their ad campaigns ask the
presumptuous question: Where are you
during the Big One? And by virtue ofthe
fact that Elvis consented to the title
change, one can assume that he is
agreeable to expanding his sales appeal.

The most important thing that should
be said right away about the album is that
it is not punk rock. It is not new wave. it is
not one of those new albums that contain
40 minutes of some guy yelling into 8
mike singing some annoyingly loud
unmelodic tune. Unfortunately, many
people have shoved Elvis into that
category without even giving hima listen,
and won't even hear this album. Forthose
of you who are willing, do so. You won't
regret it. ,

Every song in the album is
extraordinarily memorable. Each one
contains some hook, some riff, some
chorus that will stick out in your mind
and affect you. There is no ﬁlter on this
LP; every song is a winner.

To highlight certain songs on the
album for this review would be futile.
Besides being memorable, the album is
tremendously diverse. There are slow,
haunting songs, with eerie synthesizer
riffs, like “Green Shirt," or “Chemistry
Class.“ There are jazz inﬂuenced R I: B
songs, like “Moods for Moderns." There
are up tempo rockers, like "Oliver‘s

he sport known as skiing has

different effects on people.

One afﬂiction common to all

ski addicts is that they will

travel long distances to reach
their common destination, the ski area.
Some living in the Metropolitan New
York area will rise at dawn and drive
three hours just to stand in lift lines.
Others, more seriously loyal to the sport,
leave work on Friday afternoon and
celebrate TGlF by driving eight hours
northward to Vermont. The question is
not, however, what makes a skier willing
to travel so far to reach his destination;
any addicted soul can tell you the answer
is rhetorical. instead, a better question is
what differentiates one skicr‘s destination
from any other molehill with a ski lift on it
ill New York, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, or Vermont.

Niels Anderson

The answer is that a ski area possesses a
personality which is more than just its
basic facilities. Beyond the snow-covered
mountain with its many lifts transporting
skiers upward and even more numerous,
Slopes allowing them down, ,,each
individual area has a ﬂavor ’ and
atmosphere all its own. It was severalski
arcas' “personalities” located in Northern
Vermont that convinced this author to
delay college for a year. This geographic
region is the ﬁnal destination of skiers
from New York, New Jersey,
Massachusetts and Connecticut via
routes ’87, 9t and 89. Canadians also
migrate southward along routes 89, 26
and 100 to reach the six ski areas located
in this mountainous area.

The most southerly ofthese areas isthe
newly expanded Sugarbush Valley, which
this year bought out Glen Ellen, renaming
it Sugarbush North. Located in the
beautiful Mad River Valley, Sugarbush
was once known as the “home of the jet
set." In the late ﬁfties, there was always a
group of entertainment personalities in
residence who worshiped every word

uttered by Stein Erickson, then director
of skiing. Private clubs such as Club l0
rivaled the “chicness” of New York‘s
Studio 54, while other nightspots also had
their share of publicity. Stein and the
stars have now moved v , but the
nightlife remains innovatin .ypiﬂed by
Edison‘s Studio, a theatre w ch also has
a fully stacked bar. Backing up the
partying are some of the best restaurants
in Vermont, ranging from the elegance of
Sugarbush Village to the quaint Tucker
Hill Inn.

The Resort hosts a dynamic slate of
events such as ski racing, freestyle
exhibitions, and two great tributes to
Spring —- March Madness and the Easter
Fling featuring carnival events galore. At
the base ofthis social whirl lics excellent
terrain for skiing from the steeps of HS
and Stein‘s Run to the Powder of
Paradise. A great end to a season is spring
skiing at the 3,000 foot level, the Alpine-
like setting ofthe summit of Mount Ellen.
detween the 1960's and pittent a lot of
snow has fallen on Sugarbush‘s old
glitter, but no one, at least anyone who
skis, is complaining.

Sugarbush's neighbor in the Valley in
Mad, River Glen, home of the rugged
individual: Owned by Roland
Palmadero, who is quite a character
himself, it is patronized by the serious
skier, one who spurns the nightlife ofthe
valley, preferringto throw himself offthe
cliffs the area calls slopes.

Trails such as the Chute, Fall Line, and
Paradise are nothing more than a series of
rock ledges that snow clings to.
Achievement pins are awarded for skiing
the Chute within a certain time limit and
denote a true expert.

Just how seriously these skiers are was
shown several years ago when a “Save the
Mogul” committee was formed in protest
to the increased grooming of the trails.
Leading the picket line in the parking lot
was Roland Palmadcro Jr. himself. They
won as did a group lobbying to save the
single chairlift, a momento of the 1940's
and a precarious ride to the top.

After a rough day on the slopes, ski addicts h
resort. of frequenting private clubs.

All the nostalgia remains in a totally
noncommercial area where the skiingcan
only be described as masochistic. To
reach the 'bottom after a day on the.
beginner area Birdland, one must ﬁrst
traverse advanced terrain. Luckily you
wind up in front of General Stark's Nest,
an excellent bar. All this is only
characteristic of an area l would call the
most difﬁcult in the East.

Further north in the deepest snowbelt
of Vermont lies Bolton Valley, a modern
area which is described by the public
relations staff as a “Destination Resort."
This concept popularized in Europe and
the Western United States refers to a
completely self-contained community
where all the vacationer‘s needs: food,
drink, entertainment, health care and
lodging are all centrally located.

In Bolton‘s case, this is important as
besides the ski area, the nearest town
worth mentioning is Burlington, 22 miles
away. However small, the nightlife is
mellow, yet enjoyable and the facilities
ﬁrst class.

Backing all this up is its location and a
2,l50 foot base elevation, a combination
which provides 275 inches of snow
annually. This leads to some superb
skiing on 23 distinctly named trails such
as The Preacher, Abnaki, and Snowﬂake
Bentley. Furthermore, the area offers the
only night skiing in Vermont. As a
moderately priced resort, it is a good
place to get away from it all.

Stowe, Vermont in a quiet, peaceful
New England village, a bastion of Yankee
waspishncss. Billed as the “Ski Capital of
the East," it is a resort extraordinaire,
with a loyal band of followers who willski
nowhere else. The mountains, three in all,
are tough and lie steeped in tradition
seven miles north of the village proper.

The moguls of the National trail
challenge freestyle professionals at the
annual Stowe Winter Carnival, while
trafﬁc jams in the village ch "engc one's
patience. Even the stuffy, rich Topnotch
at Stowe Resort builds a snow sculpture
to celebrate and bars such as The

Whiskers and the RustyNail go crazy.
Just off.the.acceu. road lies the The“.
Family Lodge, a famous ski touring inn
upholding a tradition . of Vermont
hospitality. The Tollhouse inn, the
birthplace of the famous chocolate chip
cookie, provides excellent dining. One of
the great resorts in the country, Stowe
deserves its reputation.

Just one mile north in the summer
months when the Notch road is open, lies
Smugglers Notch. in the winter, however,
when this pass is closed by avalanches,
this lBM developed resort may as well be
40 miles‘away, when one is forced to take
the alternate route around the base of Mt.
Mansﬁeld.

Although it is possible to ski from one
to another via a connecting ski trail, the
two project totally different images.
When one ﬁrst experiences Smugglers
Notch it is hard not to realize how
tremendously underdeveloped the
potential of the area is. A small scale, big
mountain type of operation spreads
across three mountains named Madonna,
Sterling and Morse, offering skiing for all
abilities. Expert territory abounds on
Madonna with the steps of Upper F15,
and perhaps the best glade skiing in the
state can be found in Doc Dempsey‘s
Run.

This area is another destination resort
but on a larger scale, and The Village
Complex is impressively well planned and
executed with the emphasis on real estate
sales. its northern exposure brings in a
steady stream of Canadian skiers,
providing a distinct French atmosphere.
Marketing efforts and a large slopeside
sleeping capacity combine to bring in the
college crowd from all over. Coeds from
Penn State assured me the “college ski
week" was a good time with toga parties
at the Snowsnake, dancing at the
