The World
ust Never Forget ,

he Editor:
is letter is in response to the fake preview
1 d in Tuesday's ASP on behalf of the
V: Students Coalition ~~ Hillel about a
1 or on “The Holocaust — Lets Forget It
c We Can.”
I do not know what could have motivated
no to make such a sick joke about the
a aust. perhaps the most tragic event in all
rld history. The Holocaust is not tijokc;
the scnselcss and systematic slaughter of
him innocent people by the Nazi during
d War ll. Such an atrocity cannot be
tten. it must be remembered so that it
never be repeated. Recent events in
odin. Uganda. and other countries point
the world must understand the
canoe ofthc Holocaust. and ensure that
‘not happen again. The fact that several
’, lukc previews were entered on behalf of
'f RG and ASUBA does not diminish the
felt by those personally or even
~ ‘ ly affected by the Holocaust.
. ring the past week the Jewish Students
V lion —— Hillel started a campaign to
pre_ re the German government to cxtcnd
The Statute of Limitations on Nazi War.
Crimes. Unlcss changed, after December 3|.
l979. no unindicted Nazi war criminals can be
p. ‘ " Thc greatest crime against
humanity may go partially unpunished.
in closing. wc suggcst to the ASP that they
tdké serious measures to prevent the printing
of scurrilous information in the preview
sdgt'yon. This cannot be emphasized enough.

3 . i e Editor:

has become very obvious that the spring
. ter is really upon us. The library is ﬁlling
l e i ookstorc is emptying out. and the old
2Inc has set in. Along with the new semester
‘ s u more spectacular phenomenon 4
vi; hon. Remcmbcr Telethon? its been
cning all year. but the next few weeks are
Tclcthon really builds momentum. The
ersity community anxiously awaits
ch l6 and I7 us the efforts of the past year
minute in thc twcnty-four hour

extravaganza known as Telethon 79.

The Wildwood kids are special
pcople. Knowing that all the hard work and
time spent ilt beneﬁtting them makes it a
rewarding experience for everybody. Telrthnn
is not just a candy ordonut sale in the (‘nmpm
Center. [t is notjust the Used Book F L u
or a Walkathon. Sure. these are important
parts. but the real essence of Telethon lies in
the kids. Tclcthon is an afternoon spent
playing with the Wildwood kids at a
Halloween or Valentine's Day party. it is
learning the Wildwood cheer. and
understanding a child's drawings. Telethon is
taking a look at the world through a child's
eyes and watching it come alive in their
facc5.Tclcthon is kids.

So when you happen to act: a sign
advertising a salt: or an event for Telethon
take a minute to give it some thought. Join us
in our efforts to make Telethon 79 a success.

Fighting Fire (Drills)‘

To the Editor:

1 would like to openly question the practice
of ofﬁcially scheduling ﬁre drills after quiet
hours.

l cannot ﬁgure out tnc logic anOlVCd in
having a fire drill later than clevcn o'clock.
especially on a school night. [in student were
to disrupt others after clcvcn o'clock on a
school bight, he or she would be rcprcmtindcd
under school policy. By the same token. ifthc
dorm. school. or whomever schedules 8 ﬁre
drill that disrupts everyone after elevcn
o'clock. it is considered standard procedure.

Speciﬁcally. 1 am referring to a ﬁre drill held
on Tuesday evening. February 61h. Primarily.
l um concerned with the time element and.
secondly, I am concerned about thc weather
conditions under which the drill Was held. The
temperature at the time of the ﬁre drill
(nccording to the radio in my room) was five
dcgrccs abovc 1cm. It seems to me that if the
co-ordinutors of the drill deemed it necessary
to hold a ﬁre drill at this hour. they could have
at least choscn a time when the weather was a
bit milder.

A ﬁre drill was held at a later time in our last
semester. At that time 1 took up the issue with
the then tower (Stuyvesant) dircctor, Mike
Stein. He went to the proper authorities and
then contacted me and told me that the policy
had been changed so that no fire drills would
be scheduled after clcvcn o’clock. I am quite
perturbed to ﬁnd this amended policv not
being adhered to.

lhopc to point put tothc proper nIIthnritit‘N
through this letter, that this policy was to be in
effect. l hope that upon reading this letter.
they will take the above into their
consideration when scheduling their evening
fire drills.

The Big Three 

They say that bad luck comes in threes. Well. it looks like this my
will come true for SUNYA students and their pocketbooks. ~

Governor Carey is attempting to deny this university system any
growth in his austerity budget. in addition, the following might be a 
reality for students when they pay their bills next fall: j

OThcy might be paying higher room rates. It has been hinted that a $50 ‘
room rate incrcatic is in the offing. Some say this increase might be .
proposed as an alternative to the tuition hike. Others, however, believe
that tuition and room rates will be raised.

0They might be paying higher board rates. UAS General Manager E.
Norbert Zahm has said that a board increase for next year may be a l
necessity. '

So where does this leave the SUNY student? A little bit poorer, that's
for sure. But the students will also be receiving less for their money. In ,
this time of rapid inﬂation. it is curious to note that students might be .
expected to'work a bit longer and pay the higher rates in order to foot tho '
cost of increasing the SUNY budget less than the inflation rate. That‘s i
what happens when public higher education gets shoved down a few
rungs on the political ladder.

Politics should not have to play a part in education. However. when
the politicians hold the pocketbooks over an educational system, it is
time to lower oneself to their levels. This is why the lobbying efforts
being conducted by a SUNY-widc coalition headed by SASU should be
supported by studcbts.

There is little doubt that this coalition is a worthwhile idea. However,
it might take a miracle to get past the politicians. Last year, when thc
student health fee farce was presented to our distinguished legislators,
they uniformly denounced it as being immoral and promised to rcpe_al it. .
They then left it in the budget. The reason: TAP had been increased, . ‘
therefore they couldn't delete the health fee because both were student
issues. They were playing politics and the losers were SUNY students.

The game has begun again. The politicians will say. “Fine, we'll lessen

 

 

 

the tuition hike, but your room rates must go up.”And then a tuition "If
hike would be expected next year. especially if the present trends if
continue.

That is why it is so important to support the ﬁghts being waged. In the .
and, the students might be able to stop these increases, if given enough .
backing from the student body. If not, then they will wind up paying for *

it in the form of increases in the “Big Three”.

And they will have to look foward to a pompously victorious
governor who will be presenting a possible deadlicr “Big Three”: The
next three Executive Budgcts and a stagnant SUNY.
