Wrestle In University Gym

by Ken Kurt:

"Cortland is the team to beat with
Armstrong. (158), Eddy (126).
Ciotoli (134). and Rossi (142)
making them a very strong squad."
Albany wrestling coach Joe Garcia
said about tonight’s SUNYAC
wrestling championships at
University Gym. Cortland is
currently ranked fourth'in the nation
in Div. 111. seeking to improve on
last year‘s third place SUNYAC
ﬁnish. V

Binghamton. the conference
runner-up last year is currently
ranked sixth in the nation. while
Brockport. last year‘s champ. is
rated seventh nationally. Rounding
out the nationally ranked teams is
Buffalo State. competing in the
UNYACs for the ﬁrst time. They
are rated ninth in the nation. despite
the fact that the squad is the
defending NCAA Div. 111 national
champion. '

There will be 16 All-Americans
competing in the tournament. an
‘mprcssivc number since only 80
applers participate in this tourney.

time. the NCAA is picking up the
travelling expenses for participants.

As usual. there will be many ﬁne
wrestlers competing in this year‘s
tournament. Here's the card: At 118.
there will be Brockport's Raymond
Poneus (5-5). who took third in last
year's SUNYACs and sixth in the
Div. 111 National Championships.
Charles Marina. in the same class.
(9-4) of Oneonta is a returning 4th
place winner in the SUNYACs.
Rounding out 'the competition in
this tough class will be Buffalo‘s
Tom Jacotut (ll-l). a fourth place
winner in the New York State
tourney last year.

At 126. Bob Eddy (12-4-1) of
Cortland is the favorite. A returning
SUNYAC champ (at 118) Steve
Darling (6-1) of Binghamton was the
SUNYAC runner~up and third place
winner in the nationals. Podiak
(Oswego) and Denson (Potsdam)
are also ﬁne competitors in this class.

At 134. Cortland's John Ciotoli
(20-2-1) is a returning SUNYAC
champ, and is the man to beat this
year. At 142, Greg Locke (7-2) is the
defending tourney champ, but he
should have his hands full with Pete

Rossi (8-4-1) of Cortland.

At 150. Cortland's Chris Bourne

competitive.

At 158. Cortland‘s Rick

Oneonta is the only returning place
winner. taking fourth in last year's
SUNYAC‘s. Finally at
heavyweight. Paul Curkatook third
tn the nationals last year for Buffalo.

Bothdays‘ competitions promise a
fine display of wrestling. and
Albany‘s strength seems to lie in the
126, 150. 158 and 167 classes. The
Albany wrestlers should manage to
hold their own against tough
competition in each class.

Strong Second Half Boosts r
’7 Siena Over Women Cagers

by Maureen George

Albany State‘s women’s
basketball team set out with high
hopes of posting their ﬁrst victory
this season when they hosted
neighboring Siena College in
University gym Tuesday evening.
They later saw their hopes dwindle
as Siena played a brilliant second
half and came up with a 71-46
victory in what started out as a close
contest.

Although the Danes never had the
lead the entire game. the ﬁrst half
was very close. In the early minutes
of the opening half Albany stayed
close behind Siena. trailing by six
points most of the way. With ﬁve
minutes remaining in the half.
Siena's Cathy Rousseau converted a
three point play and Siena had taken
their biggest lead. 23-14. But the
Danes battled back. At the end ofthe
half they were only down by six. 25-
19.

One of the biggest problems in the
ﬁrst half was the number of
turnovers Albany had. “The girls
were overexcited about moving the
ball down the court." said Dane
women's basketball coach Johnelta
Hill.“ and they haven't gotten it into
their heads yet that slow and cas is

gonna win it. Trying to beat them
half way down the court is not the
answer because they (Siena) are
anticipating the passes and any
smart team will. so we have just got
to outsmart them."

Siena opened the second half
scoring -two baskets within 20
seconds as a result of an Albany
turnover. Albany turned the ball
over once again and Siena scored
once more breaking their lead open
to 31-19. Afterjust three minutes of
play, Siena was ahead by 12.

The gap grew larger, and with
11:50 left Siena went out to a 24
point lead. 51-27. theirlargest in the
game. and the Danes never got.
closer. The defeat left the Danes with
an overall record of 0-9. Siena is now
9-2.

Siena's Vicki Aromando led all
scorers with 21 points. Karen
O‘Reilly led Albany with 11.

“Siena did a great job ofrecruiting
and giving out money and getting
good players for this year‘s team."
said Hill. “They played a better game
than we played. We thought we
could hold them with our defense.
The defense didn't fall apart "0 much
as they were able to exploit Al and use
it to their advantage."

The Danes have eight more games
remaining and travel to Vermont
this weekend to play St. Michael‘s.
