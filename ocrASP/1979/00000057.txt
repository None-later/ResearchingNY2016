“Playing Jersey City State is good preparation for ourfuture games.
and for playoff games." said Sauers."‘Wecan'tduck the hard teams."

Should the Danes get past the Gothics. a victory in the
championship game is not assured by any means. Both of the other
entrants are quality competition. with Elmira having the home crowd v

in that opening game. Albany will be matched up with the Jersey

about being one of the top Division ill teams in the nation, and

jumpshot to break the tie, and then
after holding the ball for over one
minute. Cavanaugh found Buddy
Wleklinski cuttingto the basket. The
pass was perfect, and Wleklinski
scored on an easy layup to nudge
Albany ahead by four. With the
Engineers wilting under pressure.
the Danes piled on enough points to
turn an embarrasingly close game
into a respectable 65-53 victory.

“We started out like a ball offire.»
but then i made substitutions and we

seemed to lose monrentum." said
Dane basketball coach Dick Sauers.
“Wleklinski's basket was a big play.
though. it broke their back."

“We were in a triangle stall
offense," said Wickiinski.
“Everybody was pulled outside. and
Barry was on the wing. He threw the
pass very well. and it turned out to be
a big hoop. it always hurts when a
team stalls. and then ends up getting
a basket."

From the opening tap. it appeared
that Albany would run the Engineers
right out of Robison Gym. Carmelo
Vcrdcjo wasted no time and quickly
leaped over the RPI defense for eight
points, using his mobility for
spinning layups. and Albany
streaked to a l0«0 lead.

“That start was probably the best
basketball we've played this season."
said Wleklinski. “But then_ we had
lapses. and got sloppy. We saw RPl
play in the Capital District
Tournament. and they looked really
bad. We just couldn't get up for
them."

“We started off with intensity. but

' overall. l'd say we were lacadasical,"
added Cavanaugh. “Before we knew
it. it was halftime. and we were down
by four."

With Engineer forward Ed Meyer
throwing in l4 first half points, RPI
outscored the Danes 22-6 to go into
intermission with an unaccustomed
advantage. But it was not the
Engineers that were doing the Danes
in. Albany committed 15 ﬁrst half

“We got really careless."

explained Wicklinski. “We beganto

things. Everyone wanted to make the
big play."
‘ The Danes overcame themselves.
and RP]. primarily because
Cavanaugh and Vcrdejo combined
their individual talents. in many of
the Danes previous contests this
season. one of the two put on an
outstanding performance. but rarely
did Albany's co-captains play up to
their potential in the same game.
Against Rl’l. this was not the case as
Cavaiiarigh and Vcrdcjo took turns
in the spotlight. Both scored it!
points on good shooting nights, and
they were responsible for the Dane
scoring bursts. .

Early in the game Verdcjo
dominated. Down the stretch in the

second half. Cavanaugh took his
turn. Hitting on alongtipin. making
a steal. and connecting after a full-
court drive. Cavanaugh
singlehandedly put the game away.
With guard iiili Bellamy joining in
double ﬁgures with l0 points and an
excellent floor game. the Danes
picked up their l3th win against ﬁve
losses.

Their performance wouldn't have
won any Tony Awards. but as far
as Albany was concerned, at least
it was a happy ending.

UAC Fails To Pass 5/ U Proposal

by Wendy Greenfield

and Charles Bell

The Undergraduate Academic

Council (UAC) turned down a

proposal yesterday that would have
extended the deadline for the S/U
option to six weeks into the
semester.

Student Craig Weinsiock. who
wrote the two part proposal. said

I . however that the SI’ U issue is not it
dead one. Assistant Vice President
for Academic Affairs Helen
l)closscs will be working with
students on a compromise extension
proposal to be brought up at the next
UAC meeting.

lhc proposal that was defeated
yesterday was part of ti package bill
which included a method ol'advising
:nndcnts on the potential advantages
ililfi disadvantages of the S.’ U
grading option.

The method. which is awaiting
final action, would provide for a
notice to be printed on the SIU
option card. explaining the
“strongcst advantages and
disadvantages of the S/U option.“
according to Weinstock.

“There was a clear split in the
voting," said the proposai's co—
author Mikc icvy. referring to

yesterday‘s UAC decision. "Tire four
students voted in favor and seven
faculty members voted against it.”
One committee member registered
an abstention.

Committee member Professor
.lcan Savitt opposed the passage of
the extension proposal. claiming
iiliii the option "would be used by
students as a way of escaping a
grade."

“i know of two students who
thought they were taking the easy
way out by taking the pass-fail
option." Snvitt said. “Those students
got “ll"s and now they can't
graduate."

t‘ommittcc member Professor
llclcn Horowitz said that the S/U
option encouraged students to “slide
through“.

“People on S; U are not working
as hard. not learning as much."
liorowitl said.

Weinstock said that the debate
during the meeting did not relate to
the issue at hand.

“The faculty members were
questioning the merits of the S/U
policy itself and they really didn't
deal with the extension question."
Weinstock said.

during the case prompted the

deliberations were run in such a way
as to exclude the bill's sponsors from
participation. “There were many
essential points that were never
discussed. and there were many
crucial questions that went
unanswered." Levy said.

A rationale prepared by the
authors oftlie proposal responded to
the objection that the members of
S/ U graded courses would increase
if the deadline were extended.

The rationale referred to a survey
conducted on the drop lines last fall
which showed that two~thirds ofthc
participating students would not
have dropped their courses if the
S U option had been available later
in the scmcxlcr‘.

“There is no evidence that an
extension would wind tip causing
more S/U's." said levy. “because
people now being scared off front
courses early in the semester would
have more time to weigh their
decision and may end up seeing it
through."
