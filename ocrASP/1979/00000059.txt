'Popeye The Sailor Man if
“Yam” Really Mr. Mercer.

NEW YORK (AP) “I yam what I
yam an‘ tha‘s all that I yaml“

Peel away thje celluloid exterior.
the extraordihary image of a one-
'eyed. banana-nosed. corneob pipe-
smoking sailor man. and meet Jack
Mercer.

Mercer. in 45 years. has done as
much with his voice to establish this
bit of popular American history
called "Popeye" as any man living or
dead. He remembers the beginning
this way:

"I was working at Fleischer's as an
ln-betweener. You know what that
is: the animator would do the
extremes of the action and the in-
hetweener ﬁlled in the rest.

“For my own amusement. I‘d do
the voices for the characters I was
doing. chickens and so on. They‘d
introduced ‘Popeye' about this time.
someone else doing the voice.

“Well. somebody heard me doing
‘Popeye‘ and suggested-I audition for
the part. I didn‘t think Icould doit.

“But I kept trying. and one night
at home. I hit this peculiar tone. way
down. and I said. ‘My God. I‘ve got
it.‘ ”

That was I934. and Mercer has
been “Popeye” ever since — more
.than 500 short ﬁlms for Max
Fleischer. King Features Syndicate
and. now. Hanna-Barbera. His
latest. “The Popeye Valentine
Special: Sweethearts at Sea." will be
Wednesday at 8:30 pm. EST on
CBS.

lilrie Segar‘s "Popeye" will be 50
years old litter this month. one ofthe
world's most popular and enduring
cartoon characters.

“Popeye” was introduced in
Segar's “Thimble Theater" February
I7. I929. “a comic forerunner of

'Superman.‘ ” says Jerry Robinson
in his book. “The Comics." “He
dives out of planes and lands safely
on his ample chin; impervious to
bullets. he calmly coughs them up if
shot in the chest; knocks out gorillas.
human and otherwise; and lifts
houses and most anything else.”

“This was a time when prize-
fighting was popular.” Mercer
recalls. “and 'Popeye‘ was a hard
character. I wanted a tough guy. but
I didn‘t want him to be belligerent.

“The first guy who'd done the
voice. he was kind of gruff," Mercer
says. “I lightened it up a bit, made
him sort of a comedian rather than a
rough-tough sailor.

“Everyone asks me why he's
stayed so popular." Mercer says. “ll
seems that can be answered by
saying he‘s an unusual hero, a

champion. always saving
unfortunate 'Olive Oyl' from
‘Brutus.' "

Fleischer produced 234“Popeyc"
films in 25 years, and King Features,
which has owned the character
through the years. did 220 between
I960 and I962. Hanna Barbers
leased "Popeye" for 64 shorts and
the Valentine special. all done in the
last year. -

Chem Seeking A New Chair

rmtll‘ntn'tl from page three

"I feel that in order to restore the new
program. sortie changes ought to
occur. jit's time for someone with '
fresh momentum." he said.

Martin said the search committee
for a new chair is still in the
formative stages. Present committee
members. including SUNYA
professors Henry Duivila. 'l‘soo
King. Harold Frisch. and a number
of external experts. are now looking
to add graduate and undergraduate
students to the committcc membr.
list.

Martin said he expects the
committee to begin its search process
soon and hes that new chair will be
appointed before next fall.

Saturno cited several reasons for
his decision to resign. He said his
main desire was “to get back to doing
research and teaching.“ “When
you‘re chairman. it‘s hard to be
researching. teaching. and
administrating at the some time.“ he
