Two Die In Fiery
West Va. Plane Crash

BRIDGEPORT. W. VA. (AP) A
twin-engine Allegheny Airlines
propjet with 25 persons aboard
ﬂipped over and crashed while
taking off from an airport in a
snowstorm Monday. Two persons
were killed and at least four were
injured. authorities said.

Many survivors. apparently fearing
the plane would burst into ﬂames.
fled in panic through the snowafter
the accident. witnesses said. The
plane did not catch ﬁre.

“We had just taken off from the
ground and the plane started rocking
back and forth and all ofa sudden it
ﬂipped,“ said Sally Bishop of
Shinnston. W. Va.. a passenger who

 

was not seriously hurt.

“I didn't realize what was goingon
and all of a sudden we were hanging
from the ceiling." she said.

Dave Shipley. director of public
relations for Allegheny. said the
plane came to a rest upside down
about 100 feet from the end of the
runway at Benedum Airport.
Shipley said it was snowing whenthe
plane crashed and the runway had
just been plowed.

One of the injured was in critical
condition at United Hospital Center

in Clarksburg, a second was in'

serious condition and the conditions

ofthe othertwo were unknown. The
e remaining I9 persons were also

being examined at the hospital.

Allegheny spokeswoman Nancy
Vaughan said one of the dead was a
crew member. but she said she could
not provide either identity
immediately.

The plane. Flight 56I. was taking
off from this north—central West
Virginia city at about l:I0 p.m. It
was bound for National Airport in
Washington. D.C.. with a stop in
Morgantown.

Shipley said the plane. an M-298
twin-engine propjet wiih a capacity
of 28. was carrying 22 passengers
and three crew members.

Iranian Students W- atched ’

In American Universities ‘

SPRINGFIELD, ILL. (AP) The
Iranian Student Association is under
surveillance at U.S. universities to
determine if the group is a threat to
national security. FBI Director
William H. Webster said Monday.

Webster said he felt FBI
surveillance was warranted because
of the possibility that Iran's internal
unrest might spill over to the 35.000
to 40.000 Iranians studying in the
United States.

"We are not interested in
following all the students." he said.
“We are interested when student
groups engage in or plan acts of
violence against foreign ofﬁcials. or
against this country or against civil
rights."

Several Iranians who entered the
United States on student visas were


Free roach cll~p\'/

arrested in Los Angeles on Jan. 2
following a demonstration outside
the home of Shah Mohammad Rem
Pahlavi's sister.

Webster said at a news conference
that college administrations had
nothing to fear from the
surveillance. and he asked for their
cooperation in the investigation.

"We will need and deserve to have
the cooperation — the voluntary
cooperation —- of faculty and
administrator: on campuses and

.universities where Iranian students

are attending," Webster said.

Meanwhile. student supporters of
the new government of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini took over the
ofﬁces of the Iranian consulate in
San Francisco Monday.
