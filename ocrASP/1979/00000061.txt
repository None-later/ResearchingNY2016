NEWS OF WASTE

A new study prchCls that the cost
of radioactive waste disposal at U.S.
atomic power plants is likely to add
10 to 20 percent to consumers‘ utility
bills.

The study has been prepared by a
companv called MEH Technical
Associates. a Palo Alto. California.
ﬁrm that was founded by three
former General Electric Company
engineers who recently resigned
from GE to protest safety
procedures in the nuclear industry

The MBI-I report estimates that
there will be at least 60 metric tons of
spent nuclear fuel slated for
disehttrge by I995. It calculates that

to get rid of this toxic waste will
require a minmum price tag of $40
billion. necessitating a to percent
increase in utility bills.

The study stresses that the costs
are based on a nationwide plan for
nuclear disposal. It cautions that no
such plan has been developed by the
government to date. and warns that
costs could escalate drastically — to
the point where nuclear waste
disopsal alone could account for
from 20 to 25 percent of every
American‘s monthly utility bill.

MONKEY BUSINESS

Monkeys may soon be used to
help the disabled in much the same
way that seeing eye dogs assist the
blind.

A psychologist at Tufts-New
England Medical Center in Boston.
has been tutoring Capuchi-t
monkeys. the kind most often seen
with organ grinders on streets.

The Capuchins are considered
perfect for the job because they are
bright. adaptable. and. as are dogs.
extremely devoted to their ownets.

Mary Willard says she used the
techniques of behavioral therapists
to train the (‘apuchins She rewards
them with their favorite foods when

    
 

 

they accomplish a task. and denies it
to them when they fail an
assignment.

And what monkey business are
they taught? Willard says the
monkeys can pick up phones, fetch
objects. open locked doors and even
feed their owners.

She wants to open a school to
train primates to serve paralytics in
the same way that guide dogs are
tattght to serve the blind.

DR. FRAUD

A Houston judge has imposed a
six-year sentence on a 32—year-old
man who allegedly impersonated tl
physician and then obtained sex
from women by telling them he
could cure their cancer by making
love to them.

According to prosecutors in the
:ase. Thomas Fortand claimed to be
.t resident doctor at a Houston
Ilospilul and offered women free
gynecological examinations.

After examining two of the
"omen. he reportedly informed
them they had IIodgkins Disease
ttw offered a treatment consisting of
my uting himself with what he called
a "secret formula" and then having
sex with them.

Do

Party?

Fortand was sentenced to six
years after pleading guilty to four
counts of obtaining drugs illegally.

SOUND IDEA

The US Government is preparing
to ask for international approval of a
proposal which could create between - ’
700 and 800 new AM radio stations
in this country.

The Federal Communications
Commission has asked the US
delegation to next year‘s World
Administrative Radio Conference to
introduce a proposal which would
increase the number of frequencies
available for use by AM radio
stations.

The FCC plan would add a new
range of frequencies between I615
and IMO kilohertz to the existing

um band. which presently eoversa
.tnge of 515 to I605 kilohertz.

The FCC says one ofthe beneﬁts
I" 'hc change would be an increase of
 t 'l ity ownership of radio stations
and increased diversity in domestic
radio programming.

According to the National
Association of Broadcasters. the
World Administrative Radio
l‘ottference approval is only the ﬁrst
.tep in implementing the FCC
oroposal. It cottld take as long as live
it ten years for the plttn to be
pptovctt by the US Government.

and lawsuits opposed to the
expansion could cause even longer
ulelays.
