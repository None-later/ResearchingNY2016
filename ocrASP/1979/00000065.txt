Knieks for McAdoo. the three-time
National Basketball Association
scoring champion. Boston owned
the Golden State and Seattle choices
as a result of earlier transactions.

The Knicks were without a ﬁrst-
round selection in the NBA draft.
Itavittg shipped two No. I picks to
Scuttle.

New York's own ﬁrst-round
choice went to the Super Sonics in a
trade for Spencer Haywood in I975.
Haywood subsequently was sent to
New Orleans in December in a trade
for center Joe C. Meriwenther.

The Knicks also owned the New
Jersey Nets' No. I pick as part ofthe
territorial compensation settlement
when the Nets ntovcd from Long
island. But that pick wasturned over
to Seattle as part of the
compensation for signing free agent
Marvin Wehstcr prior to the start of
the [978-79 season.

“Bob McAdoo is a great player
and a line person but we haven't
been winning many games," said
president of
Square Garden Coer
which owns the Knicks.

“We have been seeking to make a
deal for some time bttt nobody has
offered us any players of any
substance." said Werblin. “We also
found ourselves having no first-
rottnd draft choices. We have now
put ourselves in a positiort to rebuild
the tcttrtt artd perhaps make more
trades this season and next."

The McAdoo sway was negotiated
by Wcrblin and Celtics co-owners
John Y. Brown and Harry
Manguariau. Word oftltetrade took
lower echelon employees of both
organizations by surprise.
