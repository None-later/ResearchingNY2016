Swimmers Bow To RPI, Cortland

by Jack Welnbsum

The Albany State men's
swimming team was hoping for a
solid victory over RPI at home
Friday to give them the momentum
they knew they would need to face a
superior Cortland team on
Saturday. But it was not to be as RPI
took the meet with a 67-46 victory.
The Great Danes then traveled to
Cortland and came up on the short
end of a 82-27 drubbing. dropping
their record to 4-3 on the season.

The Danes felt they were going up
against a team in RPI that was
comparable to them talent-wise. but
the psychological factor proved to be
the difference. After a sound defeat
at the hands of Rochester
Wednesday night. the RPI team
came into the meet with a positive
attitude. regarding the meet as a
must win for them and overall

seemed to be more mentally
prepared for the match.

The meet seemed to hinge on the
very first race of the afternoon. the
400 yard medley-relay. The Albany
team of Steve Bonowitz. Steve

needed to overtake the RPI
swimmers when they had to.
Albany swimmers did turn in a
few ﬁne performances. most notably
that of Tom Roberts who took the
1000 yard freestyle with a time of

Rehfuss. Frank Heter and Kevin I “212.40 having never swam this

Ahern came . second with a

respectable time of 3:5l.6. but the .

RPI quartet was just a little bit
better. turning in a ﬁne time of

3:49.}. "It was imponant for us to.

win the race.“ Albany coach Ron
White said, “We felt we should have
won and in losing we had our best
swimmers beaten."
Afternoon Action

This loss seemed to set the tone for
the remainder of the afternoon's
action. Psychologicaily down.
Albany was not beaten soundly in
the nine races they lost. but couldn‘t
seem to gain the momentum they

beneﬁt of a complete roster of

In traveling‘the three hours to
Cortland Saturday. the swimmers
were down psychologically and
exhausted physically having to swim
back-tovback meets for the ﬁrst time
in three years. Compounding these
factors was the thought of facing
Cortland. one of. if not the

Any week now. Howie Williams
will succeed in his quest to shatter
the Albany State indoor 50-yard
dash mark. But for it little while
longer the record remained intact as
the freshmen from Ringhtunton
again recorded a 5.5 effort to tie the
Dane mttrk Saturday afternoon.

“if he gets his start down a little
better he should really be going

coach llob Munsey. of his young
standout. “ lie was the first out ofthe
blocks but he stood up soon and still
kept the lead. So he‘sjust a tick away
and he knew he’d blown his poise
and stood up too early."

Realizing they were outmanned
and outgunned they knew they had
no chance to take the meet overall
but had hoped to be able to go head
to head with Cortland in several
races.

ln losing to Cortland 82-27. the
Danes were to take onlytwo events.

would be tough. “We knew they
would be going with their strongest
line-up hopingto qualify people for
the nationals." White said. “They
were just too‘ strong. they went right
through us."

Hoping to return to winning form,
the Danes next travel to Oswego for
a Wednesday night match. taking on
a team they feel they have
