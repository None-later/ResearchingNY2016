Two Black Players Accuse Coach Of Prejudice

by Jeff Cuone

Two black players uit the SUNYA men'sjunior varsity basketball

team after a January 25th_game, stating discrimination on the part of

coach John Quatrocci as their reason.
The racial prejudice was in the form of a lack of playing time for
them said the two players. Keith Duckett and Clyde Frazier.
Coach Quatrocci denied the allegations ofthe two players saying.

“if i have any prejudice at all l'm
prejudiced aginst those players
lacking in ability.”

He continued, “i try to play my
best players and do everything i can
to win as many games as i can."

Frazier said that prior to the
January 25th game against
Renasalear Polytechnic institute
(RP!) which was the tenth of the
season. he had not played and felt
there could have been no other
reason but racism.

“There was no ev't snot: [of
racism] in the beginning and l was
under the impression that i would be
playing more." said Frazier. “it had
to be racism.”

Duckett said he played about is
or 16 minutes itt each of the ﬁrst two
games bttt that his playing time was
cut after that for no apparent reason
to the point of his not playing at all
against RPl.

“He offered no explanation."

Duckett said in reference to the
coach. adding. “Hejust cut my time
slowly but surely."

He went on to say. “i wouldn't
have minded if it was players coating
off the bench and playing more but
the starting ﬁve got extra time."

Duckett said there was one
exception when the coach kept him
out of the fourth game because of a
bruised knee suffered in the previous
game.

Frazier also said no explanation

‘ had been given to him for his lack of
playing time. other than that lie was
too small. He added that the team
had played other teams with players
smaller titan himself.

Quatrocci would give no reason
why the two had ttot played more but
did say, “if any of my players Want
an explanation they can conte and
see me."

lloth players offered _ other
examples to back up their claims.

Duckett said the coach implied that
he layed off somewhat when
covering other black players in
practice.

“He scented to imply that l was
taking it easy on him[another black

replacement. mandated savtngs. an
EOP summer program, wage
increases and library acquisitions.

The SUNY Board of Trustees
recommended the tuition increase
for lower division students
regardless of class year.

Wharton said that the tuition
increase would affect only students
coming from families with incomes
of over 525.000 annually.

“After the interaction of TAP and
BEOG. most students won't feel the
tuition increase." said Wharton. He
added that with the increased
ﬁnancial aid many students will be
paying less tuition.

Ways and Means Committee
Chair Arthur Kremmcr (D-Long
Beach) questioned Wharton on the
possibility that SUNY reduce its
expenditures by cutting back on
some of SUNY's recommended $8.5
million construction projects.
Suggesting that some parts of
SUNY‘s recommended $8.5 million
construction projects be postponed
to a later date. Kremmer asked that
