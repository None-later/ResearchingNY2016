parole alter spending seven years in
jail. His ball is set at $50.000and two
months later he still sits in Albany
County District Attorney's, ﬁllies:

says- Robinson’s . one.  all? '0‘

trial in “April of May."

“i believe that. ha being held
without a cause." Robinson said in
an Interview last week. “There may
have been evidence to arrest me
because I sort of ﬁt the description.
but not beyond that."

"When you're in here. for
something you didn‘t do, it weighs
on you."

At a preliminary hearing to
determine if Robinson's case should
be held over for grand jury action.
Pinney can't identify him as the rrian
in the bank. But she also says she
can't rule him out. All she saw
during the minute or two the man
was standing at her window, was his
face from the base of the chin toliusr
above the eyebrows. He had a s srf
around his neck and a knit cap
pulled down over his head. She
testiﬁes that the man had a brown
mustache. not a long one she ssys.

more likely of medium length.

Robinson has a bushy. .red
mustache that even COMCI‘VﬂUVCS
would estimate as being long. it
extends back to his sideburns to
form a very turn-of-the—centuryish
look.

Robinson doesn't own a camel
car-coat like the one l’inney
describes the man in the bank as
wearing.

Albany Police Ofﬁcer Douglas
Muyville. who made the ﬁngerprint
identification that led to Robinson‘s
arrest. testiﬁes that in his six years
experience he had never made an

identiﬁcation baited on as few as

 

 
     
 

seven points. in fact. Mayville
admits that the identiﬁcation was a

“marginal” one; and that the number

of distinguishing points in a
ﬁngerprint can be as many as 25 or
30.

But Mayville says it is “the latent
fingerprint examiner's decision.
through his experience. through the
amount of latent ﬁngerprint that you
have. if the points match in the same
given area, its an identiﬁcation.“

Oddly enough. at the same time
Robinson's case is being presented at
this preliminary hearing. another
bank robberytakes place at the Bank
of New York's branch on State St.
The robber who gets away ﬁts the
descriptions of the man in the Home
Savings Bank almost exactly. But
Robinson is still in jail. because of a
“marginal” ﬁngerprint. .

Judge Thomas Keegan states 'at
"or hearing that “The District

torney's burden at this
eliminary Hearing. Mr. Oliver
[Robinson‘s attorney] is not a very
n. uvy one. To prove a crime was
Ct mmitted and to connect the
rlt‘lct'dlln' with it in some fashion."

“I slit. ail have been released at

that pre' rninary hearing." Said
Robinson. "lloth my roomate and a
friend suit nit-in my roomjust before
the act lllll time the robbery took
place. When they crime back about
an hour or it” hour and a halflater.l
was still there along a nap. They're
willing to lcslil v I' ,.irrt too."

Their testimony couldn‘t be heard
at any preliminary hearings though.
according to SA attorney Jack
Lester. because the function of such
proceedings is only for the
prosecution to prove they have some
evidence against the defendant.

“i am a victim of my prior record."

~ At'the tlnie l was arrested l was
sleeping off an all-nighter I had
pulled to work on a paper for my
roomate. '

“They‘re trying to make a case out
of nothing. i admit I made mistakes
in the past. but that's all behind me
now. I am conﬁdent i will be
exonerated.”

Robinson, however, is an ex—con.
something that will haunt him
forever. He'll always be one of the
ﬁrst suspects in a nation that keeps
careful track of just where Vthose
people who have “paid their debt to
society " are. Donelly even said there
may be charges pendinga inst him
for another bankjob on mbcr 5.

Who knows what evidence there
may be against him in that case. An
even bigger question though, is
where is the man who committed the
robbery on the day of Robinson‘s
hearing. and why haven't the police
beenasqnickincatching himasthey
were Robinson? Maybe he's not an
cx-con with a record they can look at
immediately connect with further
erimus. Its easy to pin a crime on
someone a society already looks
town on. It looks good on the DA‘s
ecord. ‘

Wharton however ruled out

program cutbacks as “not likely to

‘generate signiﬁcant savings." He

said that the tuition increase ‘or an
iidditional legislative appropnaiion
are the only practical options open
to SUNY for meeting its budget

avoid the tuition increase by cutting
out unnecessary items from its

cutbacks. SUNY never came back

Wharton said that the effect of
several years of lean budgets has
been “the erosion. not only. of
academic quality. but a physical
erosion as well."

- He said that the Board of Trustees
Will be seeking a “negotiated
ammcndment” to the SUNYbudget

 

before the Legislature gives it ﬁnal
approval. ‘

Wharton said that the tuition
increase for lower division students
was chosen to help reduce the
problem of upper division transfer
from SUNY schools. ,

"SUNY has been suffering from a
high rate of transferring out,"
Wharton said. adding that a higher
tuition rate for junior and senior
students would increase that loss.

Wharton said that he was not
familiar with the original rationale
that imposed the tuition differential.
and that he has alwavs been
personally in favor of a uniform
tuition schedule for all SUNY
students.
