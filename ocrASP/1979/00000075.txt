Recently. while poring through a
book of incredible, but true facts, l
was amazed at a list drawn up of the
many uncanny coincidences and
parallels between the deaths of
presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. l
was amazed. not so much by the
coincidences. but rather by the fact
that in drawing out some rather
extended analogies, these people
who compiled the lis skipped over
the obvious.

I have therefore taken it upon
myself to present to the public a list
of parallels between the lives of not
twa. but three famous men. The
men: Johnny Carson. Jimmy
CARTER[ AND Jesus Christ. The
coincidences: i. All three men share
the same initials. those being J.c.

2.A|l three have exactly six letters
in their nu mes.
3.All came from small towns. yet
rose to prominence.

4.twp of these men celebrate
Christmas. a holiday showing
respect for the third.

5.” television had been invented,
Christ would have gotten much air
time. as do Carson and Carter.

’6.Christ was a carpenter, Jimmy

Carter has a cabinet, and Johnny
Carson has had The Carpenters on
his

large enough or properly laid out to handle the
increased amount of users planned. I am a
regular user of the Snack Bar during evening
hours. As a librarian, l have to either bring my
own dinner or purchase it at the Snack Bar
When i work evenings. This is also true for all
commuters who work or have classes in the
evening. Many of the traditional commuting
users are also on limited schedules, but. unlike
the on-ca_mpus meal card holder. they have no
other Food Service choicc. lcannot stop in the
Snack Bar and if it is b :sy.continuc on to the
dorm cafeteria. l have to stand in line or not
eat.
Therefore, l strongly suggest. in order that
food service quality not deteriorate to an
unacceptable level for a captive audience of the
Snack Bar. that any such program of meal
card use in the Campus Center be
accompanied by the opening of the Deli or
Cafeteria Sections during these hours to
accomodatc the increase in population.
Sincerely.
Frank P010. Assistant Librarian

  
   
    
    
    
  
 
 
 
  

The Real
Man of Steel

, To the Editor:

l‘m writing in regard to lien Gablc‘s “Up in
the Sky lt‘s Superman". Perhaps lien Cable
and I saw different prints of Superman — the
A, Movie. or perhaps we are familiar with a
different character. or maybe even somehow
he has been on the moon or Krypton itself for
two years and did not have a chance to be
> bombarded by all the media hype that told us

. the producers wanted a story about people
and Superman's interruction and conflict with
these people. As i recall. thcyttlso have said on
countless occasions that they wanted to avoid

. the Batman Television Show "camp"
approach. We got what they promised.

Mr. Gable claims he grew up with
l, superman Well, so did l and l have read his
exploits in the comics for seventeen years and
have watched The Adventures of Superman
on l'Vfor Iwenty. i believe Mr. (iable wantsto
have his cake and cut iI too, On the one hand
he claims the comics arc unreal. On the other
he claims some ofthe episodes ofthc TV show
are unrealistic. isn't it pointing that in the
-movic we get realism. us well as funny lines.
nd what Ben likes best is character
.zdcvelopmcnt. Not only is belicf wcll
““suspendcd". remember, this is Superman
vc're talking about and how realistic is be?
his movie works well. It is about Superman,
} nlikc the old Television show which might
' ihavc better been called “The Adventures of
gClark Kent", for it took place in the Daily

Planet and George Reeves only had a brief

3 tint as Superman once or twice a show to get
tlIngs moving or to wrap things up,

F The comics are Superman's ﬁrst and purest
medium. The movie does not overlook this
and perhaps you noticed the movie pays

  
   
  
  
   
    
 
  
  

 

 

vwherc and when Superman dcbucd, in the first
few frames. This indiwtcs to me where the
U, movie gets its background.

And the movie is a delight to fans of
Superman and of his comics. A very special
i legend has developed around the defender of

“truth. justice, and the American Way" and
x the movie is true to it. This unfortunately for

lien includes the silly role of Jor-Eland the

council whcrc he tries in vain to warn them of
7 Krypton‘s impending doom. 1 was touched by
the farewell to baby Kai-Fl

l‘m glad Superman finally looked like he
could fly. He certainly didn't dwell on his
thilitics, llc landed on Lois' balcony us if he
‘ had just gotten out of It cm and went on to

more character development.

Yes lieu, lltctc was character development.
('lIu‘k Kent was linully ll good disguise. He
finally showed :Illcctiou for Lois Lane and in
his ﬁnal triumph did he snve Melt opolis from
an asteroid? 'l he cltllll from a maul-'2 No! He
fails saving ('IIlif’tuuiu because ht: saves
somcouc's mother and Lou. luue div-J. lites!
Then the orphan trout Krypton must mutt.- u

   
 

 

 

  
 

 

   

Iomagc to Al'llt)“ Comics and June l938.'

 

 

moral decision greater than any of us will ever
be forced to make, to save Lois or let her die.
He cries out in anguish and ﬂies skywurd. His
father forbidshlm to interfere with history.
His foster father tells him. “son, you are here
for a reason." The very man he "with all his
powers . . . and he couldn't even save him.”
“The Man of Steel“ deﬁes his father and turns
back time (something he has always been
unsuccessful tryingto do in the comics) to save
his love. What a ﬁnal moment!

I will not bore you with other examples of
character development. However. the marvel
of this movie is that the background and
development is portrayed visually, not Ioldin
an introduction. The onlyintroductions are to
Superman‘s birthplace: the depression and
Action Comics and to the Daily Planet. Even
casual watchers of the old Superman TV
program will remember “Faster than a
speeding bullet, more powerful titan a
locomotive. able to leap tall buildings in a
singlc bound. look up in the sky. . ." llen,you
claimed you missed this in the movie. That is
why l question whether we sawthc sumc print.
Try to remember the ﬁrst three feats we see
Superman perform: Clark Kent catches a
Muggch speeding bulch aimed at Lois. young
Llill‘k Kent jumps a Kansas Star train, and
Superman, in a spcctacularentrancc. leaps the
Daily Planet building to save Lois Lunc in a
helicopter accident.

isn't it wonderful to see humor without
camp. I refer to the color of Lois' underpants,
the phone booth scent, and Superman indeed
making himself the “Man of Steel." when he
stops a train from dcrailing. i could go on.

Yes. l too went into the movie with certain
expectations. twenty years of thcmusn matter
of fact. Everyone of mine was greatly

surpassed.
The Hard
Cell Approach

To The Edllor:

lam writingin the hope l but anyone reading
this letter will have time to strike up a lasting
friendship with me. l mu 3(lycnrs old and have
been incarcerated for over seven years now. I
enjoy meeting new people and slrike up a
friendship with strangers it‘s how l pass the
time away.

A description of myself physically. To
begin with. l'tn not much to look at, or too

pounds. with shaggy lice infested dark brown

philosophy so often?) Anyways. l‘mstuck here
at the local A,S,l’,C.A. And I‘m looking for
someone to throw me a bone once in II while.
Those of you who are fresh out ofboucs, i will
accept letters.

On the serious side. i really am ugly! liut l
have a heart of gold. which is perhaps why
people are always tryingto cut it out. I have a
good sense of humor and a dandy
imagination! l am also sensitive to other
people's feelings and thoughts and careful to
“really do unto others as l would have others
do unto me"! I live bythat philosophy! (No!
One comedian in this act is good enough!) I
am also versatile on many subjects, do II great

competitive in all sports available in prison.

ls' Justice Alive?

Ever since about third grade, we young Americans have been
constantly taught the basic tenets of democracy that supposedly
underlies our existence as a republic. They are fused into our minds,
much in the same way as propoganda is spread. and once imbedded, not
easily forgotten. '

Maybe that‘s good, or maybe that's bad; it depends on what you
think. But one underlying cementum of rights in America that cannot
be denied is that’s person is innocent of a crime until proven guilty
through due process of the law. The very essence of our justice system
relies on keeping to this; for once this right is denied, everything that
follows is nothing more than mockery of the law. from arrest to trail

John Ritchie Robinson, a fellow SUNYA student, was arrested over
two months ago at his room in Seneca Hall, for an
atte mptcd bank robbery. and has been sitting in a jail cell ever since,
guilty until proven innocent. The evidence they have on Ritchie is
absolutely inconclusivc- a seven point matched ﬁnger print. when the
FBl‘s minimum standard is twelve points for identiﬁcation.

All of the other facts seem to prove Ritchie innocent- the testimony of
friends as to his whereabouts‘during the attempted robbery. his looks
compared to the description the tellers provided and a subsequent
robbery that occured while Ritchie was in jail. Yet Ritchie still sits in
jail. Why? Because of one piece of “evidence” that the State will fail to
mention as a cause for the arrest- the fact that Ritchie is an cx-convict.

So Ritchie Robinson still sits in a jail cell, and his trial won't even
come up before April or May. He is a victim; as victim of the American
legal system‘s violations. But he is not the only victim. By ignoring

Ritchie. and others in his same position. we are ina sense givingintothc
dissolution of an America based on some “inalienable” rights, and
allowing this trend to continue.

Recently, though, a group has been formed called the Committee to
Uphold Student‘s Legal Rights, and they are in the process of taking a
number of actions to support Ritchie and pay for his legal fees. This
new group is frighteningly necessary in this day and age. yet it is relieving
to see fellow students who will not let their rights be violated.

This newspaper wholly supports the efforts of this group in their aid to
John Ritchie Robinson, and hopes they continue on this campus long
after Ritchie has his day in court, working to help students take full
advantage of their rights. But at the moment, students must work to
make sure that when that day in court does come for Ritchie, it will
arrive on the wings oftruc Americanjustice, and not on a ghost ofan age
