Against LcMoyne in Syracuse. the

absorb a 77-74 overtime defeat.
Then three nights later. on Dec. 9.
Potsdam shot an atrocious 20 per:-

half and they were dealt a costly
conference loss in Oneonta.

Since then it‘s been nothing but
triumphs. To date, 15 straight
opponents have fallen before the
Bears. There have been some
awesome results despite Welsh‘s

their home court in over a year. Still.
the Danes must perform. and
perform extremely well. in order to
overcome Potsdam.

"We‘ve been playing well. but we
can still play better.“ said
Cavanaugh. “We still have a ways to
go before we reach our peak.“

Hopeful for the playoffs in the
near-future. the Danes cannot peak
too soon. But against Potsdam

not mind very much if they peaked

In Welsll's tenure. the Albany-

“When we beat them we know we've

They have a ﬁne team. program. and
of course a great coach. We'll just

Hayes Is Defended By Colleague

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) Ohio State
University handled the dismissal of
longtime head football coach
Woody Hayes “miserably.” says
Duffy Daughtery. former head
coach at Michigan State.

“There should have been a
cooling-off period," Daugheny said
Wednesday. “ The president really
should have called him in and said.
‘Woody. you're 66 years old and it's
time for a change."

Hayes was ﬁred Dec. 30. the day
after slugging a Clemson linebacker
whose pass interception in the Gator
Bowl killed Ohio State‘s last chance
to win.

Daugherty. who coached more
years against Hayes than anyone
else. said the former Buckeye mentor
is far from the reporter-hating
introvert he appeared to be.

Daugherty. head football coach at
Michigan State from i954 to l977
and a veteran of IO ’Big Tet
Conference battles against Hayes
recalled him as a masterful tacticiu‘
who was devoted to past and present
Ohio State players and self-effacing
in defeat by his peers.

“i remember one year when we
beat Ohio State near the end of the
mason and it cost them the national
championship. Woody fought his
way through the crowd and -—~ 1 was
on my players‘ shoulders — took
both my hands and congratulated
me." said Daugherty. here for a
sports awards banquet.

Daugherty also predicted the so-
calied “Little Eight" of the Big Ten
would reach football parity this fall
after years of being dominated by
either Ohio State or Michigan, and
said he expects Michigan State to
play in the I980 Rose Bowl.

Daugherty said the resurgency of
teams such as Michigan State and
Purdue would have come regardless
of the Buckeyes'c0achingsituation.

Daugherty. who went into
broadcasting from his retirement
until I977 and now runs Coach of
he Year inc. clinics. said Hay's
‘mesmeritcd the audience" during a

clinic Sunday in San Francisco.

“1 have never heard one bad word
about Woody -— from his players or
anyone else who knew him." said the
white-haired former Michigan State
mentor. .

Daugherty. a former Syracuse
University performer and assistant
coach for the Orange and at
Michigan State under Biggie Munn.-
said he thinks Michigan State
proved the equality of the league by
tying for the Big Ten crown in I978
although ineligible for post-season
play because of an NCAA
probation.

New Coach

He said it would be difﬁcult for
new Buckeye Coach Earl Bruce to
keep Ohio State in a two-way
stranglehold on the conference.

“He is an outstanding coach. but
even if i were Knute Rockne. i
wouldn‘t want to be the guy who
lepiﬁces Woody Hayes.

Troubles On Balance Beam

of 6.55 in vaulting and floor
cxcerises. and Kathy Chemotli
chalked up the same score on the
balance beam.

“The balance beam gave us some
problem," said Albany gymnastics
coach Pat Duval-Spillane. “We
practice on a wooden beam, and
then when we go into competition.
we have to use a padded beam.
That's like playing football in a
swimming pool.” .

Connie Palma scored the highest
total for Albany with a 6.65 effort in
the floor exercises. The Gymnasts
next match is Saturday, when they
host a tri-mcet with Hofstra and
Northeastern

Layoff Causes No Problems
As Spikers Down Two Foes

by Mike Dunne

“it was like stoning the season all

were game-stale." said men‘s

team's performance in victories over
New Jersey institute of Technology

" ofa match with Rutgers
on February 7.
sThe opening match was not as
tough as expected because NJiTwas
without three of their starters. The
Danes were sharp but still managed
to stay unbeaten on the season with a
15-7. l5-5 triumph.
Stiller Test

New i’altz posed a stiffer test for
Albany as the home team came back
from an early deﬁcit to close within
two at 8-6. The Danes then scored

four straight points with Gene
Sosiak sewing to put the game on
ice.
The New Paltz squad started
much better in the second game.
staying close to Albany. However,
Earl's team got it’s offense clicking
during the middle pan of the match
and went on to win l5-8. '

These two road victories give the

Danes a perfect 4-0 record for the
season. They will get theirﬁrst test of
the season this Saturday when they
visit Piscataway to face Rutgers.
Rutgers is ranked 5th nationallyand
they possess what Earl describes as
“a very quick offense."

Earl was once again pleased with
the strength of his bench and felt that \
“everyone on the team played well.”
Earl feels that his strong depth will
be a key factor in the Danes success
this season.
