personal best. '

Though extremely satisﬁed With
his squad‘s showing. White looks for
even better performances in the near
future. As the season draws to a
close. the swimmers are in top form.
and with every race try to bring
down their times a little bit more.

“We‘re working into a gradual
taper, and as we ﬁnish out 'our
schedule. our times should continue
to be reduced with every meet.” said
White.

This Saturday afternoon. the
Danes take on Buffalo and
Binghamton in an unusual double
dual meet. Albany faces Buffalo and
Binghamton in separate meets while
Binghamton also faces Buffalo. All
three should be close since the teams
are evenly matched. but the Danes
hope to use the momentum from the
Oswego win to aid them in defeating
both foes.

State’s}:   Grapplers

by WEB. Beelin- I

The Albany State men's wrestling
team. a squad possibly in possession
of more talent than they‘ve recently
shown. will attempt to bring that
talent to the forefront this weekend
when they travel to Colgate for the
New York State College Wrestling
Championships.

The Danes. distant losers in the
recently completed SUNYAC
Championships. will look to
improve on last year's eleventh-place
ﬁnish in what could be a I'd-team
event. in last year's tourney. hosted
by R.I.T.. Jim Morriil's fourth place
ﬁnish and Steve Zucker‘s sixth
highlighed the Dane effort.

On Friday night it will either be
Zucker or Seth Zamek competing at
“B. depending on the outcome of
Wednesday night's intrasquad

matches. Morriil will wrestle Ron
VanAntwerp foi' the rights to the
l77-pound class; the loser will
occupy the. 190 slot vacated by
injuries to John Baldwin (separated
shoulder) and Ed Morales (knee).

Going right down the line. Steve
Bertrand will handle the chores at
126. followed by Nick Guzman
(134). Pete Toporowki (142). Dave
Straub (150). Mike Greco (ISB).
Steve Cronin (167). and at
heavyweight. Bill Bornstein. Two
big Albany grapplers will not
compete. however.

“We‘re holding back (Rick) Porter
and (Paul) Hornbach." conceded
Albany coach Joe Garcia. “Both
received some injuries at the

want them hale and hearty for the

Garcia. president of the New York
State Wrestling Coaches
Association. when questioned on the
issue. of annual withholding of
wrestlers from the NYSCWC's.
offered an observation with obvious
concein and an intended
explanation"

“We’re aware of the problem.” he
said. “Coaches hate to risk an All-
American with the nationalz. just
two weeks away. so we‘re going to
try to reschedule the New York State
Championships for early January or
February and move the SUNYAC‘s
up one week. That way. colleges like
Union and Rochester. which will
forsake the New York' State
tournament to go to the Eastern
Qualifying site this weekend. will be
able to compete. it's a high priority
on the coaches' agenda." last week's
SUNYAC tourney was the national
qualiﬁer for all conference members.

The answer to Albany's hopes and
chances this weekend lies in the
relative youth of it's squad. “We
improved tremendously with each
match this year.” noted Garcia. "and
i think we can continuctoimorove.”

As far as competition is
concerned. the class of the
SUNYACs are the Red Dragons of
Cortland State. overall champions
last weekend and owners of nine
national qualiﬁers. Not far behind
are the Brockport Golden Eagles.
with eight California-bound
wrestlers and a second-place ﬁnish in
the SUNYACs under their belts.
The Buffalo Bulls. N.Y.S.
Championship titlists and national
champions a year ago. faitered to a

' third in the SUNY AC‘a last week but

nevertheless rerriain tough for the
Danes.

Concerning the tournament
overall. it could become an all-St.
Lawrence affair. The lCAC-member
squad Saints will come to the meet
armed with ten national qualiﬁers
and a 1978 second place illillll to
avenge. However. with the pressure
of qualifying for the nationals
behind and the season nearing an
end. the Danes may use their youth
and spirit to surprise quite a few
people at Colte this weekend.

Last Event Relay Triumph
Boosts Women Swimmers

by Janet E. Cernl

Albany State's women's
swimming and diving team put itself
back onto the winning side on
Wednesday evening with a 66-65
come-from-behind victory over
Utica College.

The 200 free relay team of Pat
Dillon. Minica Rossi. Joan
Miekelham. and Ann Hock
unleashed a surge of pent up energy
to nudge out their opponents in the
ﬁnal event of the meet to gain seven
points and more importantly. the
single go-ahead point.

Women's swimming coach Deb
Fitzdam praised the efforts of her
team members in the ﬁnal meet of
the season before the NYSAlAW
meet in Syracuse next week. “it was
really excellent." Fitzdam said. “An
all out team effort is what really
helped us to win. Joanjust poured it
on in the third leg of the winning
relay team to give Ann is good shot at
the victory. i was very pleased.”

The Great Danes also earned
more than a single ﬁrst place ﬁnish.

whitewash. Divers Chuck Griswold

and Miekclham combined in both
the required and optional one meter
diving events for ﬁrst and second
places. respectively. while three
ﬁrsts. in addition to the winning
rclay, were racked up by individual
swimmers.

Rossi gained a ﬁrst in the 500 free
and Barb VanSlykc snared what
Fitzdam termed an “important
victory“ in l00 breast. the second to
last event of the meet. which carrie
just before “the great relay effort.”
VanSlykc also won the loo
individual medley. Hoch. a sprinting
specialist, placed ﬁrst in the 50 fly
and second in the 50 free. closely
trailed by Miekelhamin third place.

Although tln Danes garned' tlla'r
usual high number of second and
third place ﬁnishes, Fitzdam cited
the large number an essential to the
victorious effort. in that they placed
in almost every event. “Usualiythey
work against us because we‘re
unable to earn a good number of
firsts." Fitzdam said. “However.
Wednesday night they combined
with the ﬁrsts to give us that extra

edge."
