SUNYAC Title At Stake As
DanesSeeh Playoff Berth

by Paul Schwartz 4

Anything but this very situation
would have been a surprise. Both
teams expected to be somewhere
near their present positions. and both
looked at the other asthe team to
beat. The- teams ——‘— Albany State
Great Danes and Potsdam Bears.
The stakes —- high. The prize -— very
likely the SUNYAC basketball
championship arid an automatic bid
to the NCAA playoffs.

When Albany and Potsdam clash
tonight in University Gym, it will be
the ﬁrst head-to—head confrontation
this season between two squads that
have been watching each others'
every move. The Danes enter the
game with . impressive enough
credentials — a 6-1 record in
SUNYAC competition and 15-5
overall. plus a seven game winning
streak.

However. those numbers pale
when compared to the package
Potsdam has managed to put
together. We Bears own an 8-]
conference mark, and boast a
glittery f9-2 overall record. Also.
Potsdam is currently riding a l5
game winning streak.

“They are the best team that will
come into our gym this season.“ said
Dane coach Dick Sauers. “And
they're better than the teamthey had
last year -— the one that won the
SUNYAC championship."

As far as this year's SUNYACtitle
is concerned. it appears to be a three-
team race. Behind the two favorites
is Plattsburgh. holders of a 5-1
conference record. Potsdam handed
the Cardinals their first SUNYAC
loss Tuesday, whipping the home
team 65-53, and the Danes will travel
to Plattsburgh this Tuesday.

The Danes are in the situation
where they can control their own
destiny. If Albany can defeat
Potsdam and Plattsburgh. they will
almost be assured the crown. All that
would be necessary is victories over
conference lightweights Binghamton

(1-7) and Oswego (0-6). both games‘
that will be played in University
Gym.
If‘Albany does not win the title,
they still will have a shot at an at-
large playoff bid. and judging from
their strong record against a difficult
schedule. the bid' is a definite
possibility. However. the Danes
want no part of selection committees
if they can avoid it. so the Potsdam
game looms even more crucial.
“This is obviously our biggest
game of the season." said Dane co-
captain Barry Cavanaugh. “But ifwe
win, it's just another step. We still

I have to play Plattshurgh."

To beat Potsdam. the Danes will
attempt to take aWay the Bears two

imajor weapons — the fast break and

the zone defense. Thebreak is led by
sophomore point guard Ed Jachim.
who is “the key to their team."
according to Saucrs. "He's the one
who runs their fast break. and they
try to rtin at every oportunit ."

        
 
  

4) Onoonto 5-2

The second problem the Danes
will have to confront is the Bears
tough l-3-l zone defense. This is the
same defensive setup that gave
Albany a great deal of trouble
against Hurtwick, and Sauers feels
that. “Potsdam plays the zone as well
as Hartwick. We must solve the
problem ofthat zone, and force them
to play us man-to-man."

Potsdam has clearly been effective
using the zone defense. but it has also
gotten them into trouble. Against
Oneonta earlier in the season.
Potsdam‘s unwillingness to pan with
their zone played a major role in
Oneonta‘s 79-54 victory. “Potsdam
wanted to play their zone." said
Sauers. “but they got way behind
early in the game. and eventually had
to come out of the zone."

The Danes will also have to deal
with the Bears solid front line. led by
6‘4" center Derrick Rowland and his
22.9 scoring average. v

“He's one of the best centers we'll
see this year." said Sauers. “He‘s not
that big. but he's very agile. He is
similar to (lirmelo Verdcjo in terms
of physical ability. Our post men are
going to have to outducl theirs."

Besides trying to deal with the
Potsdam strengths, Albany will also

look for weaknesses to exploit. Ii'the .

Bears have a weak link, according to
Sauers it is in their depth. or actually

Tonight’s The Night: Albany vs. Potsdam'

 

Bears Invade University
Gym Boasting 19-2 Record

by David Osborn

They have a balanced blend of
experience and youth throughout
their lineup. There's a fine
ballhandling senior guard who
directs operations on the court anda
young center from Long Island who
carries the bqu of the scoring load.
'It has all added up to victories
for the Potsdam State basketball
squad — l9 of them to be exact
agaimt only two losses

When the defending SUNYAC
champion Bears bunt onto the
University Gym floor at 8:30
tonight. they’ll present a squad
which is not totally unlike Albany
State‘s. In vying for a second straight
title in what amounts toaconference
showdown of sorts. Potsdam will
show a balapced team with a
tenacious defense and the desire to
break at any opportunity.

coach Jerry Welsh over the phone
Wednesday. “But we've been playing
well on the road all year and it'sjust
gonna be a matter ofwhichteam can
adjust to the pressure better on
Friday night.”

The Bears are coming off a big
road win. Tuesday night. they
traveled up to Plattsburgh and
whipped the Cardinals 65—53. The
victory lcft Potsdam. Plattsburgh
and Albany all tied with one loss in
the SUNYACs. Soph Ed Jachim,
the ECAC Rookie of the Year last

. season. keyed the Bear attack at

Plattsburgh with 23 points.

With Jachim and senior Jack
Bissetta in the backcourt, Potsdam
starts a pair of shon guards —— both
are a tad under six feet —- who are
quick on defense and also handle the
chore of triggering the break quite
well. Welsh is deep enough to keep a I
steady stream of fresh players in the
game which f orestalls the possibility
of a woozy contingent due to the

excessive breaking.

“We have a good deep. unselfish
squad which gives me the
opportunity to substitute very
liberally." said Welsh. “That not
only helps by keeping fresh people
out there to break with, but it helps
defensively also. It can be very tiring
to constantly play the hounding
defense. But with substitutes. we‘ve
held seven straight opponents under
60."

Last year the Bears highest scorer
showed an unimpressive ll point

average when they played Welsh's
unselfish blueprint to the extreme.
This year they may be a better squad
since they do possess more legitimate
scoring threats and they've averaged
83.9 points per game.

Leading the newly-found scoring
punch is sophomore center Derrick
Rowland. Hailing from Brentwood.
Long Island. Carmelo Vcrdejo‘s
hometown. the 64% scorer comes
into tonight's battle with a 22.9
average. His high game all year was
30 against Oswego so he's a solid,
consistent scorer; better underneath
but a threat from anywhere.

Jachim has scored at a l3.6 clip
and more importantly has averaged
6.7 assists each game. llissctta, who
Welsh calls the ﬁnest defensive
guard he‘s couched in eight years at
Potsdam. isn't called on to score very
often‘ in the Bear attack. Fran
Demyan. a senior forward. and
Terry Hunter. the other starting
forward. are needed for rebounding.

“Obviously we have to rebound
well to get our break going with a
quick outlet pass to one of the
guards." Welsh explained. “We rely
equally on all three frontcourt men
there. It seems that we‘re peakingin

every area of our play. If we can}.
continue to playthis well itshould r ‘

a real battle against Albany."
Potsdam has had few battles to
judge by this season. They presently
own the largest average margin of
victory figure of any Div. III teamin
the nation; beating their foes by 20
points each time. They began with
three quick wins before running into
some trouble with St. Lawrence
before prevailing (ii-60.
The Saints. who've already gained
a berth in the playoffs, were leading
the Bears by one with seven seconds
left when Demyan connected on a
short jumper and Bissctta then stole
St. Lawrence's inbound pass to ice
the win. Then ca me the only soft spot
all year. Potsdam was beaten back-

Wharton Raises Admit?) ceiling

SUNY Chancellor Clifton Wharton has approved a raise in the
student activity fee ceiling from its current level of $70 to $80 per year.
According to SUNY Vice Chancellor for Educational Services and
Student Affairs James Smoot, Wharton released a letter yesterdav

authorizing the hike.
“The Chancellor's wrsn was to

“He was also concerned that some
student governments might design a
budget and set a fee that wouldn't
take the student's opinion into
consideration.“ Smoot continued.
“Therefore the letter takes into
account an expectation that a

referendum will be put up to the

students in each school should their
governments elect to raise the fee.“

Smoot said the Chancellor could
not mandate that each SA in the
SUNY system put a referendum
before theirstudent populations. but
that “he (Wharton) was merely
making, an advisement."

"‘As I interpret it, it will be up to
student government to
determine whether to propose a
referendum." Smoot said.

Wharton approved the raise in the
ceiling. despite the opposition of
college presidents from throughout
the SUNY syslem. SASU President
Steve Allinger said in November of
last year that various SUNY.
presidents were dissatisfiet‘ with the
level of funding for intercollegiate
