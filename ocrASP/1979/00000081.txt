Wharton Raises Activity Fee - Ceiling _

million in his budget for SUNY.

Chancellor Wharton and the Board

of Trustees said that a tuition

,Mwithout receiving another $9.]
zir‘iti‘lton ‘in.the budget." explained
“ ASU member Bruce Cronin.

A few weeks ago, ASU organized
a student letter-writing campaign
against raising tuition. in response
to this campaign. Cronin said Carey
sent it statement to S.A. President
Paul Feidman stressing that only the
Trustees could raise tuition.

Carey‘s response was termed as
“passing the buck" by Cronin and
ward.

“Carey cut the budget to force in
tuition increase from within SUNY
Tthc Board of Trustees) itself.“ said
Cronin. and the Trustees would
rather raise tuition than make cuts."

He criticized the Trustees for not
demanding a halt to the budget cuts
and the threatened tuition increase.
' “The trustees haven't done
anything; it's in the students laps; we
need action," said Cronin.

Ward agreed, “it's most important
to get SUNY students to put
pi'cssure on the trustees; to disrupt
the trustee meeting to prevent any
such action (the tuition increase)."

The Trustees are less likely to vote
an increase in tuition with students
at the meeting. They don‘t want a
confrontation; they are already
nervous about raising tuition. We
can enter the building us a student
assembly and make our presence
known; we would like about l00
people there." said Cronin. ‘

“But if we lose at the Trustee
meeting. we'll still ﬁght 'like hell'."
Cronin described the fates of
