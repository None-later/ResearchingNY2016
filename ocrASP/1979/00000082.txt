 

When we ﬁrst signed on the air last year at 4:00 pm, March lot we chose a song we felt
best presented the" musical direction in which we intended to go. Bruce Springsteen’s classic Born
to Run’ set us off and running on what has been an incredibly exciting year 1n radio.

We’m may I» celebrate our anniwmryl I .

That’s why this March lst (thursday) at 4:00pm we’ll be playing ‘Born to Run’ a very special way: over
the bells of the Carillon! This unique event in SUNYA history will be made even more special because

 We’re giving away three complete collections of

3 Bruce Springsteen’s albums plus ﬁve giant four ft. by four ft.

Feldfnan however, supports the
higher ‘ceiiing. “It will give“ more
ﬂexibility to SA's at schools that are
financially acted on a Student

immediate increase in the fee at
SUNYA Feldman said, although
inflation is “eating away“ at
available funds. '
