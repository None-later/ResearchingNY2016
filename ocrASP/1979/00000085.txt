also because i could use my meal card and
pay nothing), i chose the Rat as the first
stop on my search for the ﬁnest sandwich
in Albany. We (1 was with a friend)
pushed through the turnstile and hung the
right that brought us to the Sub Bar.

,STRIKE ONE: There were about six
sub rolls lined up, waiting to be ﬁlled with
the meat of my choice. Lettuce and
tomatoes were already on the rolls. 1 hate
tomatoes, and chalked this nice personal
touch (we do it all in spite ofyou) as strike
one.

i ordered my turkey sub, without the
tomatoes, with onions, American cheese,
and extra mayonnaise. My friend Mark
ordered a roast beef sub ($l.65) with
tomatoes, onions, and Russian dressing.
STRIKE TWO: There was barely
enough mayo (probably some lesser
brand that came from who-knows-where)
to cover the side ofthe roll it was applied
to. Mayonnaise usually acts as a cement
to keep the lettuce on the hero; my lettuce
kept falling off as a result of this
stinginess.

We punched our meal cards for the
wedges (that‘s what they call subs in
Westchcster) and sat down. Mark

explained that he usually likes ketchup on ‘ “

his heroes (that‘s what they call subs on
Long island), but the Russsian dressing
would do. '

l reached for my first bite, and ~—
S'l'RlKE THREE: 1 put my linger right
through thefreaking hoagic(l don't know
where they call subs hoagics). l
remembered that the subs in Albany
come on what looks like a giant hot dog
bun. Almost all places use these rolls; 1
still decided to take a point off because it's
really not a true hero on a soft roll.

My first bite wasn‘t too bad. Sure, there
wasn't very much meat STRIKE
tFOUR), and sure, most of the lettuce
ended up in my lap, but for a buck-fifty
[free with a meal card), it could have been
a lot wo‘rse. Naturally, it could have been '
a lot better. which is STRIKE FIVE. The l

1 sub, like almost everything at the Rat,
carries the unmistakable stamp of UAS'

mediocrity. Mark liked the roast beef.

The five strikes give the UAS Sub a
live: not had, not good — about as
mediocre as anything can get.

The second stop on our search was
Albic‘s, located on Western and Quail. It
is not very hard to find — just look for
Sitka, the Siberian Huskie that is usually
hanging out in front.

After the play ended last night, the
eight actresses gathered in a corner near
one of the exits. Wrapping themselves in
each others‘ arms, they “hugged,
rscreamcd, cried, and hollered in
happiness," one of them later recalled.

Matthew Cox

1 in a discussion that followed with
' about 60 members of the audience.Victor
Barrett, who‘s directing “For Colored
Girls Who Have Considered Suicide
When The Rainbow ls Enuf," said he had
tried in the play “to get seven women
together to developasisterhood feeling."

The actresses, six of them black and
two of them white (there was one
lunderstudy), said the play had created
just such a feeling between them. One of
them said she believed “There’s a bond
between us now that i don‘t think
anything could destroy.“

For Earleen Knox, who played the
“lady in red,“ the play stirred strong
feelings “because it had to do with dealing
with the problem of communications
between men and women."

Constance Valis, a white actress
playing a black role as the “lady in green,"
said Barrett's instructions as the director
' increased the personal meaning the play
had for her. “One ofthcthings Victortold
us was that the characters were to be
ourselves m we were to dig into ourselves

. i am playing myself here."

The other white actress in the play,
Becki Nikolski, playing the "lady in
brown,“ said “i didn't feel like i was
i playing a black woman. i felt like i was
playing out some of my own
experiences."

Barrett acknowledged encouraging the
actresses to draw on their own
experiences in their acting roles. Such an
approach, he said. plus the use ofa round
stage helped to “personalize the play" for
both the players and the audience. A
round, or arena-type stage, where the
audience surrounds the action, "makes
for a kind of rapport between the

Collectively SUNYA has a most
decidedly pal'e complexion — it is hardly-
the place one would expect to witness a
theatre piece entitled For Colored Girls
Who Have Considered Suicide When The
Rainbow ls Enuf, much less find an‘
audience for such an endeavor.
Nonetheless, Ntozake Shange‘s free form
poetry, dance, song, and music piece
opened to a packed house in the PAC
Arena Theatre. Sunday, February l8, to a
predominantly palcly complected
audience. .

For Colored Girls is for colored girls,
maybe, but mostly for women — all
colors. lt ' is an exploration of, a r
celebration, and an expiation ofwomen. '

A cast of seven women weave a web of l
womanhood, black and other-colored,
round and round the arena stage. Theirs ,
is a web that demands audience
entanglement we and the unity of those
breath-holding, throat-lumping, heart—

within the circle of the Arena Theatre dn
opening night were proof of the piece‘s
universality. Victor Barrett, guest
director in residence # originally from
NYC's Worker‘s Rep Company, chose a
mixed cast of live black women and two
white women to present the piece. He
intended to use the mixed cast to help the
audience gingerly step over the color

barrier. it turns out that there really was
little need for common color after all —-
common experience tugged us far more
deftly into the web the women wove. They
wove with a sensitivity and a sensuality
that is as inherently black as this
calculated analysis of their artistry is
white. ,

For Colored Girls begins with a
disjointed sequence of darting and
ﬂuttering. Yet, just when the tentative

tinglings of disappointment start
reaching conscious proportions, women
emerge to hover alone, and

disappointment dissolves.

Alone and collectively, darting and
hovering, the women weave a fabric of
unappreciated love, neglectful men, rape,
and virgin sex in the back seat of a Buick.
Over and over, their men emerge a
scourge on womankind, yet a
compulsively attracting, painfully
necessary force all the same. We only see
them through a woman's eves — the!
