Albic‘s is a pretty small place. There is a
table with two chairs, so I suppose you
could eat in there. but i never have. Albie
(or whoever the guy is who is always
there) is young. a nice guy. We ordered (I
didn't bring Mark  not discriminating
enough) and sat down to wait. And wait.
STRIKE l/2: lie prepared to wait about
ten to fifteen minutes per sub. Those who
consider this to be painstaking

point in Albic‘s favor; I think the hungry
will just get cranky. I didn‘t care much
one way or the other (besides, I needed
the time to copy down Albic's

come in were very strong. and would
probably drown out the taste ofthe meat.
I took his advice, and passed on the
onions.

this is tantamount to charging for the

Turkey Sandwiches

For Colored Girls will play through

Albic makes his subs out ofsight. This
isn't a reﬂection on the quality, it‘s merely
a statement of fact  he makes them
below the counter. if you have to watch
something, there is a television set on.

Finally, the subs arrived. We paid (hel
wasn't kidding when he said his prices‘
were higher than what l was used to). and
off we went. It was one of the tallest
Albany subs l had every had Albic uses
a quarter-pound ofmcat. llealso puts on
salt and pepper. so be sure to tell him if
you don‘t want it.

The final strike. of course. was for the
glandular hot dog roll - it takes away so
much. Albie‘s gets a 7.5 the best sub
I‘ve had this year. l know that there hasto
be a better one . . . somewhere.

-~ Solid acting.
But [I “look-Core

omcone once said that George

C. Scott reading a telephone

book aloud would be more

captivating than most actors

' performing Shakespeare or

Tennessee Williams. Scott chose to act

out Paul Shrader‘s script rather than Ma

'Bell's in his latest outing, and his choice
may not have been such a good one.

Richie Mermelstein

In Hardcore, Scott shows once again
that a great actor italicizes the ﬂaws in a
faulty script by illuminating the areas
where the emotions displayed are
superior to lines surrounding them.

Scott plays Jake Van Born, a wealthy
Dutch Reformist from Grand Rapids,
whose straight-laced ways cause his
daughter to ﬂee from home to become a
two-bit porn queen. Van Dorn employs
the services of a private investigator
played by Peter Boyle, to aid in the search
for his runaway daughter.

After Boyle starts to derive pleasure
out of his investigation of the
pornographic world. Scott opts to seek
the child himself. For the better part of
the film, we see the overly moral Calvinist
perusing the smut-filled world of
whorchouscs. peep shows. dirty book
stores. and cheap hardcore films.
(Actually, the lu'ltt'r part of the film takes
place when Boyle searches for the
yottngster using a private eye's intuition
that would make Philip Marlowe blush.)

 

 

The most glaring problem with the~

script is the total lack of attention paid to
the circumstances leading to Christine
Van Dorn‘s initial ﬂight. Shradcr. who
wrote and directed the picture. only
shows us a tedious ('hristmas dinner and
a sudden farewell scene at a Greyhound
terminal as Scott‘s daughter heads for a
religious retreat. It is not until the final
scene that we learn of Christine‘s
complaints with her father which
prompted her ﬂight. It would have been
much more effective had Shrader given us
a chance to build some empathy for the
child.

Scott spends about half the film doing
first hand police work. Some of it is
entertaining. some of it suspenseful, and
some of it poWerful. We are obviously
being set up for the “famous final scene".

The Human Body

‘continued from So

proteins for use throughout the body, It

manufactures chemicals such as glycogen
om glucose. And it breaks down amino
ids, broken down from protein, into

useable chemicals of waste. The liver. the

largest body organ, is a giant chemical

factory working night and day to create a

better tomorrow.

And in the end hydrogen molecules
penetrate the cell membranes ttnd chew
up the loose elements. Drooling bacterial
armies gnaw and stick the last of the
lingering living. The war is over. All the
soldiers went home into the dirt they were
born in. Maybe they could have held out
longer. Sure. maybe the supplies would
have lasted another ten. twenty. thirty
years if you don't smoke that carton of,
bag a week. or drink that fifth every
'l'ttcstlay with Harry and the boys over
poker. or Louise and the girls ovct' Mali
.long. Or maybe you could lli\\’t'L‘lll down
on the ('ttrvcls. and the whoppcts. and all
the other poisons. but it's too late for

.His portrayal of the underside of our

 

the room. ’l'lili strong ammonit' smell of

in which the two confront each other.
Scott emotes like hell, and breaks down
teary-eyed, with a realism that few actors
could convey so convincingly. But before
you have time to say Dr. Strangelove. the
scene has ended. with a complete
turnabout tn feelings, which simply isn‘t
possible. given the actual words spoken
between the two. If Scott had improvised
the lines, he could have expressed a more
captivating discourse.

Shrader should be complimented for
his attempt to approach a unique topic.

I

society is no worse than Scorcesee‘s Taxi
Driver. Scott‘s concern for
actress/ prostitute Season Hubley (Nicki)
is even more interesting than Robert
DeNiro‘s concern for Jodie Foster.
There are some hidden messages about
religion and societal niches. but they

    
   

unfortunately are underplayed. Boyle's
final comment to Scott. “You don't
belong here,“ is only a step away from
having a real impact, but the portrayal of
the differences between Scott‘s world and
Boyle‘s is forsaken in order to build the
suspense during the long search.

The interplay between Boyle and Scott
is the highlight of the film throughout.
Hoyle plays an almost Dom l)cl.uisc-likc
lovable dick. whose innate ability and
undisguiscd grccd is wonderfully
admirable. When the two actors clash.
fireworks could ﬂy. or Boyle could back
off. The Dom DeLuise in him prevails.
and he backs off -r— with his own sort of
dignity.

Despite the many good moments. the
prominent holes make Hardcore :1 hit soft
inside. The fine performances and
sporadic moments of excitement.
however, might just make it worth your
while.
