On July 7. l9‘70the police came to my house
at 8:00 a.m. in the morning and told me that
they wanted to talkto me downtown (station
house). Once at the station house. they
arrested me again for a crime that l was
allegedly supposed to have committed back in
May. This time, however, 1 had no onetoturn
to and 1 had to remain in jail.

Subsequently. in March of 1971 [agreed to
take a lie detector test. My lawyer made an
agreement with the District Attorney‘s ofﬁce
that if the results came back negative I would
be released. It turned out that l was not only
given one lie detector test. but in fact, 1 took
two of them. The results —— negative. The
D.A.'s ofﬁce would not release me. (Just like
the FBI promised to release me if my
handwriting came back negative).

Consequently. and after being at Rikers‘
Island for twelve months, 1 was tricked into
pleading guilty to a‘crime I didn‘t commit. 1
received a sentence of 0-3 years.

On June 20th. 1972. 1 was released from
Elmira Correctional Facility with a chip on
my shoulder — “I wanted to get even for what
the system did to me." 1 took to the streets and
committed the crimes that 1 had been accused
of when originally arrested in June of 1970.

On Oct. 5. 1972. the police arrested me, but 1
had gotten even. so I didn‘t care. This is where
my head was at then. In any event. 1 was
sentenced alter httving been found guilty by a
jury to a minimum of 3 years and a maximum
of 15 years. I was lucky, I guess. because the
judge could have sentenced me to eight and
It third to twenty-five years in prison.

At ﬁrst I was sent to Clinton Correctional
Facility to start serving my sentence. it Was
not until then did i realize what I had done to
myself. my family. and my life in general. You
see. Clinton is for incorrigibles, and most of
the inmates there are in their 30‘s and up. Here
it Was. 1 was only 22 years of age and after
taking a good look at things. I knew that
“prison life" was not for me. Most men at
Clinton have spent practially all their lives
behind bars. Eight months later I Was

‘ transferred to a medium security facility —'
Eastern Correctional Facility.

While at Eastern 1 was determined to get my
act together. For three and a half years I
received and actively participated in
psychotherapy. My sincerity and
determination shocked most at the facility.
My endeavors at Ulster County Community
College culminated when I graduated (1976)
with honors (3.6 cum). 1 never felt so proud
before in my life. Here it was. a convict making
it back from the depths of darkness. I knew
that l was ready to re-enter society and
become a productive citilen once again. The
Parole Board released me in August of 1977.

August of 1977 was when 1 ﬁrst entered
SUNYA. At ﬁrst 1 was experiencingacultural
shock —- being separated from society for so
long a period. Howaver. l was determined to
overcome any and all obstacles. My ﬁrst two
semesters weren't too good. In fact. I had to re-
apply after the Spring. 1978 semester because
my academic standings had fallen below
SUNYA's requirements.

I was re-admitted in the Fall ( 1978). I knew I
had to do well and there Were no excuses for
doing poorly. Well. at the time ofthe arrest on
December 14. 1978 for attempting to rob a
bank. I held it B—plus average. In addition. 1 t
was working 22 hours per Week at the Indian
Quad Cafeteria. Clearly, this demonstrates my
endeavors and sincerity to be successful.

Fortunately. “The Committee to Uphold
Students' legal Rights" has been formed to
aid students who may ﬁnd themselves in the
predicamentthat l'm faced with. However. the
Committee is going to need support in order to
succeed in their endeavors.

I ask that you w The Students of SUNYA
(and faculty)  unite and support The
Committee to Uphold Students' Legal Rights
to ensure that justice is carried out.

Finally, 1 just want to say —« l thought 1
would never say it — but Albany State, I miss
youlll '

Up With The Tax

Now that SUNY Chancellor Wharton has raised the student activity
fee ceiling from $70 to $80 per year. SUNY studentsacross the state have
a choice to make. Here at SUNYA. the student tax is $70 per year, and
the student body can now elect to raise that as high as $80 or keep it at
I the current rate. The choice is ours to make, and we should certainly take
I advantage of any opportunity to have a real say as to where our money

will go, or whether it will go at all. For we rarely have that opportunity,
with politicians downtown shrewdly watching their political standing
now that election day is long past. arbitrarily raising tuition here, room
rent there . . .

And with all of that. many of us have become extremely wary of
anything that even resembles a suggestion to ask for more money. But
sometimes. a little more money deposited into the right account can do a
world of good.

Each year. when Budget Committee struggles through its difﬁcult
task of fairly dividing the money we have paid for various student
activities. the general comment seems to be the same: There isn't enough
money to go around. Hence. good clubs are eliminated and budgets are

- chopped. sliced. diced and minced ﬁner than one could with a Ginsu

knife. And the students end up without some groups. who don't have
enough money to work to full capacity.

The answer seems apparent. Now thatwc ﬁnally have the opportunity
to raise the tax, we should. Judiciously. of course. In light of $100-and-
up increases proposed right now for tuition. a few more dollars a year for
us (that's Where the money goes. you know) seems almost like a breath of
fresh air midst the Albany aristocracy.

And we can use the money. With a little more student tax money
coming in, we won't have to do things like do away with a golf team that
has been here since before most of us were born, or cut the budget of a
new group like Focus so low. that they can't even really establish

themselves properly. The incredible variety of extra-curricular workings
here at SUNYA will have a chance to ﬂourish, not wither.

Fight the tuition hike until the end. Fight the room rent hike as well.
But with a chance to drop sOme badly needed money into our very own
laps. we say jump on it.

by Michele Israel
As 1111 ASP reporter. I was recently assigned
to write an article concerning it growing
problem on the SUNYA campus.
Investigating this matter further. 1 found-it
extremely difficult to remain objective as a
good reporter should. Each time 1 interviewed
ti source. facts and figures were presented to
me that drew it sud draft of the university
community. This problem to which 1 am
referring is called vandalism. or. a hobby for
the destructive.

This pusttimc seems to prevail on campus.
despite the unlimited activities available to
uuyonc and cvcryonc. It costs SUNYA
approximately a half tt million dollars a year
and is basically pursued by people with.no
respect for property. Take for example. the
slicer thrill of destroying a few windOWs.

As some people have analyzed it. this is a
means of ridding oneself of built tip
frustrations. This may be condoned by peers.
but think twice. if you Will. Last April.
approximately 200 windows were broken.
costing the university close to 313.000. An
unnising figure. isn‘t it'!

Allow me to continue. Let‘s suppose some
of your cronies have been consuming great
quantities of alcohol and decide to saw off the
legs of II chair in a lounge. Multiply this
activity by one year. The answer should
amount to $55,000 in furniture rcpuirs, This
figure does not include those pieces lllllt are
damaged beyond repair.

Then, there's cvcryouc‘s favorite playpen.
the lavatory, There are mirrors to smash.
dispensers to tear down from the walls. and
doors to remove from stalls. us in the case of
the Rat. ’I'hnt cost UAS approximately
$17,500.

There exist those damages which are not
always labeled as acts ofvnndiilism. adding tip
to 8100.000 ti year, And. one final cxtnnplc is
the damaged plumbing and lighting ﬁxtures-
that cost $20,000 11 year in repairs.

The point? We“, look at the figures. This

     

    

  

money is being ti. d to pay for
services. These funds are paying the university
to produce vandals. A studcnt who destroys a
light need not worry about paying for it; he's
‘ not even expected to pity for it. The damages

are fixed without a warning. and without a ’

complaint. it's become rotitinc. Or maybe
people are just fed up.

Perhaps this is It result of ti lack of

responsibility. Students need only to watch
out for themselves. They have no major
cliorcs. They aren‘t forced to “clean up after
themselves." In short, students ~13ch
practically cvcrytlting handed to them. As a
show of gratitude, the campus is destroyed.

This is not to say that students are the
primary suspects. “’l'ownics“ have their fair

share of fun and games. llut wlicn onc'

considcrs the amount of money involved. one
would lend to believe that people would tone
down it hit.

A half a million dollars could be used to
purchase new academic or athletic equipment.
to hire more professors, or to provide funds
fora student activity. Let us also consider thc
tuition hikc. It's somewhat ironic to see
students complain about a $100 increase when
$500,000 a year is merely wasted on the repairs
for damages caused by foolish pranks.

'1 lic solution? One could go to extremes and
threaten the culprits with expulsion from
school. Students could be threatened with it
greater financial increase. Security.could be
strengthened to the extent of dorin patrol.
Think. however. of the atmosphere. It would
not he conducive to trust.

[I bothers Inc to hear people conclude that
the problem stems from an "attitude"
classified as apathy. People don‘t seem to be
considcrncd with their surroundings. Shabby
lounges and litlcrctl and damaged dorms seem
to have become Iicccpttiblc. lt‘s rcttllya shnmc.
It's really downright unfair.

I suppose it is apathy. Uncivilized may be a

hit too potvcrful but I'm beginning to won.
