Saucrs. “but sometimes the official is
at it different angle, and he’ll call the
foul.“ '

Albany called a time out. adding
to the already building suspense.

'Aftcr a. minute had ended, Theiss

stepped to the foul line. The court
was empty. Theiss bounced the ball,
set himself. and calmly and cleanly
sank his ﬁrst shot. The score was tied
at 52, and Albany called another
time out.

A minute ofthought later, Theiss
again strode to the line. The crowd

' was hushed as Theiss set, and put up

his second shot. It appeared long,
and the ball hit off the back of the
rim and bounced harmlesst away,
sending the game into overtime.
Albttny had their reprieve.

“It was like letting the air out ofa
balloon." said Law. “We had the
game in our hands. All we had to do
was hit an unguarded I5foot shot."
unguarded 15 f'ooot shot."

“It gave us a new life," said Saucrs.

“After he hit that ﬁrst shot, I thought
we were down the drain, and we
:ouldn't do anything about it."

The missed foul shot merely
prolonged the agony for the Danes.
Verdejo scored two quick baskets in
overtime, but the Danes could not.~
control the action. Verdeio fouled
rout with 2:25 left. and Cavanaugh
followed with his ﬁfth foul a minute
later.

Still, Albany had one last chance.
With 15 seconds remaining, the
Danes trailed 60-58. and diagramed
one ﬁnal play. Clune brought the
ball upcourt, and lobbcd a pass to
the left side of the rim. Kelvin Jones
jumped, caught the ball, and in one
motion banked the ball off the
backboard. The shot fell just short,
Just as the Danes had.

Albany‘s problems against

.Plattsburgh stemmed from the fact
that the Cardinals completely shut
down the inside game that the Danes
offense is centered around. Playinga
triaiigle-and-two defense,
l’lattsburgh had man-to-man
coverage on (lavanaugh and
Vcrdcjo. and a three man zone
against the rest of the Danes. The
brill could not penetrate inside. as
Cavanaugh, still somewhat slowed
with it muscle pull in his stomach.
could manage only four shots all
gatnc. All four missed the mark. and
the Albany center finished with oitly
three points.

“We piftyL'd their two big men
tnttn-to-man," said Law. “We
figured that if we were going to get
beat. their guards were goingto have
to beat us."

Depending primarily on outside
shooting. the Danes got strong
offensive games from Clune (15
points) and Bellamy (10 points).
However. the inside game is an
integral part of the Danes scoring
punch, and without it, there was not
enough.

The showdown with Plattsburgh
was set up by the Danes' win over
l’otsdum on Friday night. Albany
was sparked by Verdejo. who scored
26 points. with l6 comingin the ﬁrst
half. when he played “the ﬁnest half
of basketball I've ever seen him
play.“ according to Sauers.

in direct contrast to the
I’ittttshurgh game. the Danes were
able to solve the zone defense against
l’otsdiiin. and continually score
from inside. The Bears l-3-l zone
was similar to the strategy employed
by llartwick in an Albany defeat
earlier in the season. but the Danes
adjusted. and took control of the
game.

"'l'iiitt's the thing about Doc." sitid
Jones. who hauled down seven
rebounds for Albany. "He never lets
you get beat by the same strategy.“

to ending the Bears IS game
winning streak. the Danes slowed
down the Potsdam fast break. and
held Derrick Rowland. the Bears
leading scorer, in check. Rowland
finished with to points, but had

' difficulty getting the brill in positions

where he wanted it. Albany led by six
iii halftime, and much to the delight
of the University Gym funri. never
allowed Potsdam to comecloser titan
f'our points until the closing seconds.

“Albunv made very few inentiil
'errors”, said l’otsdun couch Jerry
[Welsh "And iii the tough games. the '
team that makes the fewest errors
will win. They didn't make the
mistakes lilill bcttt themselves."

Couch Welsh obviously didn't se
the Dunes against l’luttshurgh.
