This past Saturday, the Albany
State men's swimming team split a

. dual meet to close out their “330m

c"ding up withla 7-4 record. They
were to race St. Michael's this
Saturday in what was to be their
ﬁnal match but the meet was
cancelled due to the illness ofseveral

.swimmers on the St. Michael team.

In splitting what turned out to be
their ﬁnal regular season meet ofthc
ear. the Danes bested Buffalo 65.
46, but dropped a decision to
ginghamton 59-54. Int addition,
Binghnmlon also took Huffman—56
in what were three separate meets all
run at the same time.

With the regular season now at an
cnd,eoaeh Ron Whitetakes his team
inlotheSUNYACchampionshipsto
be held at Geneseo. and while
Albany is not expected to beat out
SUNY powerhouses Cortland,
Geneseo and Potsdam. White feels
his team should make a creditable
showing. I

“We expect to be right in the

a «4...: .

middle of the pack," said White. "We
really don't have the depth to ﬁnish
on top but we do have some ﬁne
swimmers who should be able to
qualify for the NCAA
championships."

In the triple dual meet against
Buffalo and Binghamton, the Danes
featured some fine individual
performances to bolster a solid team
effort. Notable in this respect were

_ Steve Rchfuss, who once again took

both the 50 and 100 yard freestyle
races in times of 22.3 and 50.2
respectively. Of Rehfuss, White said
“he‘s a very versatile performer. He
has the potential to be a SUNY
conference champion as well as
qualifying for the nationals."

Tom Roberts came through with

another good all-around effort. He

finished second in the I000 yard
freestyle in I I:06.7 and third in both
the 50 yard and I00 yard frecstylcs
with times of 23.3 and 5].]
respectively.

Steve Bonawitr. took the 200 yard
backstroke with a school record of
