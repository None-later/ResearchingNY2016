The Albany State men‘s volleyball
team took to the road last week
trying to build on a perfect 4-0

record, but came away with a 5-2.

mark. On Saturday they faced, and
were beaten by nationally-ranked
Rutgers-Newark in New Jersey.
Then on Tuesday night they played
highly regarded Springﬁeld and
Boston University in Springﬁeld and
came away with a split.

The results were somewhat
disappointing, although the
experience gained through playing
tough teams away from home could
prove valuable to Albany as the
season progresses.

The Danes came out ﬁring against
Rutgers, playing them even early in
the ﬁrst game and eventually took a
I0—4 advantage. The home club
began to battle back, although
things looked good for the Danes
when they took a 14-10 lead.

Hod/ever, Rutgers then showed why
they have been the eastern
representative to the national
championships for the past two
years as their high powered offense
scored six straight points to win the
game 16-14.

“We played too cautious," said
Albany volleyball coach Ted Earl.

abandon as we had early in the

The heartbreaking defeat in the
opening game obviously affected
Albany as Rutgers took them apart
in the 2nd game. winning by a 15-1
score.

Rutgers-Newark also won the 3rd
game 15-8, but it was a bit closer
than the score indicates. Earl felt his
squad‘s play improved but Rutgers
momentum was toughto overcome.

“I think we matured greatly
during the match," Earl said. “We
played welll against the ﬁfth-ranked
team in the nation. When we came
off the court we weren't afraid of
them. My team has a lot to be proud
of."

Earl described his team's play as

Against Boston University the
Danes play was much improved. The
play of Kirk Andrews and Gary
Becker helped the team to a 15-6
triumph. Albany suffered a let down

bogged down offense for the loss.

by Paul Schwartz

When Gary Swatling graduated
from Albany State last May, his
plans for the future were anything
but deﬁnite. Oh, there was an
application to the Nielson Rating
Servicein Chicago, and the notion of
a career as a baseball publicist, but
nothing really substantial. Mostly,
his days were spent "sitting around
the house." A A,

“’0le FEATURE:

_——-—-—‘
A

Then one day in the middle of
September SWatling got a call frorn'
Bob Rice, who then was the
Assistant Director of Community
Relations for the University. Rice
asked Swatling if he would be
interested in helping out with some
of the day-to—day duties related to
sports information. “I told him‘Yea,
sure, I'll be down there yesterday,"‘
Swatling remembers saying. Less
titan two months later.
Swatling was promoted to thejob of
'Sports Information Director, his
current position. The match was
“emineg made in heaven.

 

“About ti week or so before I got
the call I decided ‘Hey, this is what
I‘ve always liked‘" said Swatling. “I
know it fairly well, and I‘m not the
greatest publicist, but I know the
needs of the media — bow to go
about promoting a sporting event.
So I decided that this is what I was
going for. l was going to try to
become something in publicity —
hopefully involved in sports. I was
very pleased when Bob called me."

Swatlingis tall, with straight black
hair and a mustache, and appears
older than his 22 years. A 1974
graduate of Shencndehowa High
School, he was a member of the
soccer and volleyball teams, and
“fooled around keeping statistics for
the baseball team." Interested in

:psychology. Swatling narrowed his

college choices down to Buffalo and
Albany, and chose the latter because
"I would get a car if I came to
Albany.“

Swatling wanted to make some
money while in school, and was
hired as a student assistant for the
News Bureau. With his intense
interest in sports, he also became
statistician for the football and
basketball teams, a position he
maintained until he graduated. His
cxperieuces as a statistician
Introduced Swatling to the Albany

 

Stale sports scene, a scene that
ould eventually take a special place

in his life.

Things did not fall into place
perfectly at ﬁrst. There was a
learning period, and some telling
moments. “They make the forms
(statistic sheets) quite easy, so you
can ﬁgure out what to do," Swatling
said. “It's just that you have to
concentrate on the game and not
miss anything. I remember the ﬁrst
football game I went to with the
team ~ I was going to a football
game. I wore a sweatshirt andjeans,
and everybody I went with inthe van
was in a suit and tie. I felt
embarrassed about that."

Swatling retired the sweatshirt,
got over his embarrassment, and
gradually received additional

responsibilities. In hisjunior year, he

 

handled some press relations and
nclpcd with phone calls to the local
media after basketball games, tasks
that would prove valuable
experience for his eventual role as
Sports Information Director,

The job of Sports Information
Director at the beginning of this
school year was originally slated for
newcomer Frank Backer. However,
Backer became ill, and was unable to
step in as SID. That was when
Swatling was called' in, and he
continued as a part-time fill-in until
Novcmbcr 4th, the date of the
Albany-Ithaca College football
game, The week leading up to that
contcst proved that Swatling was
ready to handle full-time duties.

With that football game being
televised regionally by ABC-TV,
there was an enormous amount of
last-minute planning, and Swatling
was in the middle ofit all. Putting in
a full week of arranging, planning
sessions, and publicity meetings,
Swatling made a favorable
impression on Director of
(‘oinmunity Relations Phil
Johnson. Before long, it was Gary
Swatling, 511).

In his new iob, Swatling has a

daily routine in a week-long cycle.
He must be aware of each team’s
schedule, and ﬁnd out the results of
every sporting event, and compile all
the Information into a weekly sports
release. Accordingto Swatling, there
are three steps that must be followed
for each sports event. First,
advancing of the event, so the local
media know what will be happening.
Second, covering the event itself ——
recording the vital statistics. Third,
reporting the event, or telling the
media what happened. Swatling is
responsible for all three steps,
making for a hectic personal
schedule. '

During football and basketball
season the work load hits a high
pornt. Swatling travels with the

teams in those sports, and since both
involve Ii great deal of media
coverage and spectator attention,
the job of circulating information
becomes extensive. Programs for
each home game must be prepared,
and all the local newspapers and
television stations must be kept
informed as to how the Albany
teams are doing. Traveling with the
team, though, gives Swatling the
most pleasure.

“My father is a truck driver, and
that means when he came home from
work. he wanted to stay home. So I
never got to travel much. When I
began to travel with the teams, I
found out that I like to get away very
much."

At a football or basketball game,
Swatling can be seen intently
watching the action, filling out a
chart he is always writing down
something 7 and scurrying off to
the Press area with the halftime
statistics. “We try to get everything
to the media as fast as possible, and I
think we do a good job. I‘ve been
complimented that of all the local
schools, we seem to get the statistics
out fastest. That‘s the only
compliment I could expect. And to

any sort of high school title but he

see a good story in the paper the next
day, that's always nice to read. It
gives you the feeling that you're part

On every sports team, there are
players and coaches. There is also a
small number of people
sometimes only a single person —
that is considered a part of the
group, a member of that special
circle, even though they neither play
nor coach. Although his position
could alienate him, instead,
Swatling‘s voice hints at traces of
emotion when he speaks about one
team —— the Albany State basketball
team, and their coach — Dick
Sauers.

After the games I have a few beers

"There are a lot ofpeople that you
may not know that don‘t sit on the
bench but feel like they're part ofthc

up tomorrow, and that‘s where you
really see how close they were to this
man and this school. They come
back from wherever they are. and
have a great time. That's the feeling

“One of my cousins went to school
here in the late '60's, and I told him a
few years ago that l was involved in
Albany State basketball. He said
‘Whtit do you plan on doing after

you graduate?‘ And I said that I

coaches. It's a very tight-knit group,
and I enjoy that close feeling. It‘s a
I very close team, this year especially.
“They tell me I‘m part of the

practices, and there‘s a lot of other
things I miss out on, but —- they‘re

Sauers takes care of his own.‘ And
it's true. He gives a lot ofpeople a lot
of help -— he gets them started.
When players graduate he make?
sure that they know what they wan
to do, and if he can help them at all,
he does."

When Swatling returns from a
read trip — his favority duty — he
must immediately start on his least
favority chore — writing. “I really
don‘t write," he says, “ljust fake it.
Putting the paper in the typewriter is
my least-favorite job.”

Looking into the future, Swatling
expects to be back as SID next year,
but has no deﬁnite long-range goals.
“1 really don‘t have any deﬁnite

personal gOaIs. I would love to move
up in sports information, but if
something else would come up, I
would be happy to try it —»— to ﬁnd
out if I like something else. I don't
think lcould be settled in oncjob for
an entire career.

“As far as a goal, right now it
would have to be in sports
information. Ohio State SID would
be nice —— I don‘t know, something
like that. Bob Ford (Albany State
Athletic Director) released a long-
rangc athletic plan — things that he
would like to have done in the
university's athletic program. One of
them is a full-time professional
Sports Information Director.
Hopefully I could improve fast
enough to become that person. 1
would like to try to.“

Being involved in Albany State
sports for the past ﬁve years,
Swatling has observed from the
inside the growth and development
of the athletic program.

"I feel that Albany State is an
excellent Division 111 sports
program. Most of our teams
compete against Division 11 teams
and are very successful. The athletes
are well prepared by the coaches,

and the coaches do an excellentjob
W the whole staff is professional.

 

“'I‘hc athletes are unique. They're
great people. They have
personalities. I enjoy working with
them, and I like talking to them.
'l'hcre's a feeling that even though
you‘re not participating, you're still
part of the learn. and that says a lot
about the athletes and the coaches
here.

“I fch very strongly for the school
and the people in it. Ileing involved
in sports for four years was the best
thing that happened in my whole
college experience. That's why I

was so thrilled to come back here
and work for these pegile."
