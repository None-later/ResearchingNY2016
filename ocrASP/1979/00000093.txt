Albany used perimeter shooting to

Even if Albany State winds up in a

The present conference charter

he was unsure of the format himself

in giving Plattsburgh the ﬁrst oftwo

Capitalizing on the opportunity
given them, the Cardinals scored on
an even longer jumper. this time by
Kevin Baldwin. The fans were going
wild, and with good reason; their
team only trailed 52—51. Ill seconds
remained. and a confused Albany
squad had called a time out: ,

“My kids had a lot of heart in
those last few minutes." said
Plattsburgh coach Norm Law.
“Sometimes l think they have water
in their veins instead of blood."

The Danes set up forthe inbounds

backcourt. Rob Clune hurled a full-

Plattsburgh called time out with 19

“We lacked discipline down the
stretch," said Dane coach Dick
Saucrs. "We played with a lack of
intelligence. and i think everyone
made at least one ballhandling
mistake near the end."

“We were up by six. but we were
playing like we were down by six.“
said Albany guard Buddy
Wleklinski. “There were turnovers

we didn‘t have to make things

Danes' Dick Sauers. to consult
about a possible solution. '

“in the official conference annals
it will go down as a three-way tie,"
said Ridcll. “But that policy of
determining who gets the automatic
bid was noticed when we looked over
the operating by-laws and it will
have to stick. I rcalilc the problem
Albany has there but we can't change
policy over one instance."

Lack Of Lights Is Safety Hazard

A report prepared by a student in a trafﬁc safety class has shown as

The statistics, gathered by a student in Dr. Richard Ellts‘ traffic

l09 lights were out between the quads and the podium and an
additional 9 Were out on Perimeter Road. The student cued that the
