beenpverwhelming. There has been
a lot of experience in the last two
years with handling recombinant
DNA. and no one has gotten hurt. I
don‘t believe there is any danger.”
Speaking on the bureaucratic
aspects of recombinant DNA
research. Lerman said that the
National Institute of Health (NlH)
has recently “changed its regulations
in terms of classifying which recom-
binant experiments have to have
more stringent containment (of
organism) procedures. It is possible
that the NIH might drop these
guidelines altogether as scientists are
finding that containment is not
necessary for-most of the recombi-
nant organisms." Lerman added that
"all containment regulations have

been followed here. and will can A

tinue to be followed."

When asked why he thought the
recombinant controversy had faded,
Lerman replied that “the students
here at SUNYA have made ajudg-
ment on the controversy by letting it
die down. Recently the DNA ques-
tion was brought up before the SA.
but they did not comment or act on
it. The students were simply exer-
cising their intelligence."

Lermiin added that when the
controversy ﬁrst began, “scientists
realized that there were some
unknown factors which they should
discuss among themselves. Here at
SUNYA there emerged on the one
hand a group of people trying to
raise a scare. and onthe other hand a
group of scientists who essentially
remained quiet on the subject. When
NYPlRG tried to organize a forum
on the subject in l977. our scientists
were reluctant to participate because
they didn‘t want to get into ii debate

 

without being able toexplain the
technical aspects of recombinant
DNA.” '

Lerman feels that the opposition
to recombinant DNA was made up
of many people who did not known
sufﬁcient amount about the subject,
with educated scientists deﬁnitely in
the minority.

Board Increase

situation,“ said Zahm. “There‘s the
expense of people, utilities,
equipment. We are subsidizing the
Campus Center contract meal
program by transferring units from
the quads to the Campus Center.
There‘s no question that it's popular.
We won't have to do much analysis."
“When you go to the Rat. your
hamburger is processed right in front
of you. You don't have one cook
making 400 hamburgers." explained
Fertig. “You haile someone at the
grill. someone at the sub bar.
someone atthesoda fountain.and so
on. it‘s not as efﬁcient as on the
quads. but it‘s not mass produced.”
Other UAS costs that have
increased include Social Security
beneﬁts. the minimum wage and
liability and Workmen's
Compensation insurance. said
Zahm. When the minimum svagc
was increased by 27 percent last year.
it cost UAS an additional $80,000.
he said. Further increases in the
minimum wage are planned for the
next two years. bringing the actual
figure to $3.35 per hour by I981.
One of the reasons that UAS has
been able to hold board rates at their
current level since l975is the volume
ofSUNYAstudent's participatingin
SUNYA‘s contract meal program.
said Fertig. He compared
approximately 6200 students on

 

 

sunva'. meal plans to the 3000.

students contracting for on-campus
food service at SUNY/ Binghamton.

“When Norb goes into the market
and buys 20.000 cases of orange
juice, it‘s a lot cheaper than someone
going in and buying 5000," said
Fertig.

It is UAS‘s “no frills” plan.
however. which has kept SUNYA

board rates the lowest in the SUNY.

system. and as much as $200 per year
less than those at some SUNY
schools. said Fertig.

“Everything is cut and dried,"
explained Fertig. “A lot of schools
work on a coupon system. You pay
by coupons. and you can have a‘
steak dinner every night, but it's a lot
more expensive. Here. we‘re simply
presented with a choice of two
entrees."

"Not only can we buy cheaper
than some. but we have very good
food . people here. and we‘re
efﬁcient." said Zahm. "We've been
holding our costs down for years.
but you just can't control them any
longer."

Cabinet To Discuss Begin
In Mid-East Conference

JERUSALEM (AP) Israel's Cabinet meets

Tuesday to decide

whether Prime Minister Menachem Begin will accept a U.S.

invitation to a Mideast conference
Sadat is skipping.

which Egyptian President Anwar

Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan llew infrom Washington Monday

night to attend the crucial session.

Some Israel leaders have voiced doubts that Sadat‘s representative,
Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil. would have the power to make

decisions at a summit and said they ’
feared the meeting could lead to
pressuring Israel alone on issues
blocking a peace treaty.
The issue is between the two
countries. and not individuals.“
Begin said. adding. "Sadat is the
man who takes most of the
decisions.“ .

in Washington. White House
press secretary Jody Powell. pressed
on the issue. said Khalil “has been
given. and has had, the full authority
to negotiate and conclude a peace
treaty.“

Sadat kept mum on why he
decided to send Khalil to Camp

David. He toured in petroleum
refinery and cement plant in
Alexandria. Egypt. on Monday and
avoided reporters.

One of the president's aides said
Sadat should not be expected to “do
everything" and that it was ﬁttingfor
Khalil to represent Egypt since both
he and Begin are prime ministers.

When Caner announced his plans
for a summit. he left Sadat the
option of joining the talks if they
proved successful.

For his part. Begin has refused to
commit himself on whether he will

attend. saying he would await the
outcome of the Cabinet session.
