SASU.- After Eight Years ..-' 
It’s Still Warking Hard '

. The Student Association of the State Universities. (SASU) is an:
eight year association founded to represent SUNY students on an
equal, state-wide basis. This organization, which is made up of-
delegates from member SUNY universities, lobbies in the state
legislatures on bills they feel are of great importance to all SUNY

students.

In addition, SASU is afﬁliated with student unions, (such as the

Albany Student Union. and SUNY
student governments in order to gain
grass root support of the
constituents. Two caucuses have
also been established by SASU in
recent years to represent minority
students and women.

W

The organization receives it‘s
funding from dues paid by the
member schools (35 cents per full
time student). Out ofthe 24 schools.
20 are active members of SASU.
Stony Brook, Canton, Brockport
and Coblcskill are not members. It is
reported that these four schools
dropped out due to the
establishment of the Third World
and Women‘s Caucuses.

SASU was begun in 1970 by the
late Ray Glass of SUNY

Binghamton, who realized that
student governments acting alone
were nearly obsolete. Lobbying in
the state legislatures in order to
represent student needs began as a
result of his founding ideas.

The main issue at hand for SASU
recently has been the ﬁght against
the proposed tuition hike. SASU
maintains that Governor Carey's
committment to public education is

' questionable. (The January issue of

SASU‘s newspaper Grassroots,
banner headline read, “Carey to
SUNY: Drop Dead") ‘
SASU reports that New York
gives more money to private
universities than all other 49 states
cornhined. Last year the state
granted 1.5 million to the private
Syracuse University for'a new
domed stadium. SASU argues that
SUNY needs 9.l million in order for

this money is merely “a drop in the
bucket” compared to the funds
doled out to the private schools each
year.
Retention Problem

Chancellor Wharton recently
proposed to raise tuition by Sl50 for
only lower division undergraduates.
The chancellor stated that this
increase would counteract upper
division reténtion. (a growing SUNY
problem). However, SASU argues
that this increase’in tuition for
freshman and sophomores would
create an even larger retention.
problem as fewer students would be

' entering the SUNY system. “And if

fewer students enroll," said SASU

Post, “then Carey will decrease
SUNY money even further."

SASU says the motivation behind
the tuition hike is a result of the
pressure of 75 syndicated banks on
SUNY to conVert $261 million in
short term notes into permanent 30
year bonds. This conversion was
intended to be completed by 1982,
but pressure is on to have it done by
i980. If this deadline is adhered to
then a shortage of cash will be the
result, according to SASU.

In addition to SASU‘s campaign
against tuition increases, the
organization is working on
numerous other projects. They are
joining efforts to have national and

districts so that students can vote for
county and state ofﬁcials in their
school districts imtead of hometown
ones. SASU also tupporti funding
for inter-collegiate athletics. part~
time TAP. (SASU states that part
time students of all ages are
discriminated against because they
receive no TAP assistance), and
TAP aid for emancipated students.

Post stressed SASU’s need (for
student support. “During the tuition
hike crisis the Governor received
over 14,000 letters from'students
complaining of the increase," stated
Post. “This support helped greatly
and more and more input will be
needed to ﬁght this thing."

China: U.S. Criticism Ignored

PEKING (AP) A Chinese ofﬁcial told American reporter‘s Monday the Chinese-Vietnamese war to last

The ofﬁcial spoke with the reporters — who are accompanying

Treasury Secretary W. Michael
lilumenthal on his current visit to
China ~ on the condition that his
name not be used.

There were signs Monday that
Chinese leaders were annoyed by
Illumenthal's banquet toast Sunday
describing China as the

“trunsgressor” inthe Indochina war - t -

and warning that it could hinder the
growth of U.S.—Chinese relations
and risk a wider conflict. This
"message" to the Chinese was suidto

spokesman Iiill Stubbs described it
as a “low-key" ceremony.

An American informant said
Blumcnthal may have more to say
about the war in a 90-minute
meeting scheduled for Tuesday
afternoon with Chinese Vice Pre-
mier Teng Hsaio-ping. “I assume
he will have a message to
communicate" on the ﬁghting, the
American said.

The Chinese ofﬁcial interviewed

When American reporters

saying, "We do not feel it is that big
an issue to warrant so much
coverage.“
