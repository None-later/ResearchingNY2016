ast Thursday night, one of the

longest existing rock bands

played at the Palace Theater.

in a concert sponsored by

UCB and WCDB. The Kinks.
who were formed in l96l, will someday
be considered one ofthe legendary acts of
this musical era. Despite an impressive
string of commercial hits, their success,
however, has for the most part been
supported by a fervently enthusiastic, but
moderately-sized group of fanatics.
Witness, as example, the not quite
capacity crowd on Thursday. The Kinks,
if they noticed, were not fazed.

Brian Kurtzer

The opening act of the concert was a
particularly annoying, hard rock band

 

~named TKO. During their assault to the

senses I could make out some lyrics to
their second song. As they sang the
words. "Stay Away“. I wishcd that they
had followed their own advice.

After it short break. the Kinks took the
stage. Sort of. Opening with a musical
version of“You Really Got Mc,“thc most
noticeable Kink was nowhcrc in sight.

After all, Raymond Douglas Davncs is
the show. He's the man up front. The
singer, the songwriter (he‘s probably
written 90 percent of the songs on their
almost countless albums), the entertainer,
cynic, clown, comedian. Ray Davies is
one of the premier performers in his
business. and he likes to highlight that
fact during the act.

So, several minutes into the opening
song, Ray came running out, picked up
his guitar. and sang several stanzas.
immediately following, they broke into

the rousing title song of their album of
three years ago, “Sleepwalker.” With
Mick Avory providing a steady rockbcat,
this number highlighted the band's recent
trend towards rcemphasizing the solid
lead guitar playing of Ray's brother,
Dave Davies. On such upbeat rockers,
Dave is the musical backbone of the
group, and his solo towards the end of
“Sleepwalker” was an excellent reminder
of this fact.

But that is the extent of Dave‘s
prominence. ’thn he later stepped

forward to sing his composition, “Trust
Your Heart,” from Misﬁts, in a strained
voice, one could conclude that it was done
only to allow Ray to step offstage and
make another shirt change. When Ray is
onstage, he stands center stage.

it was Ray‘s energetic versatility that
was most impressive throughout the
concert. lmploring the crowd to sing
along as he played the familiar chords to
“Lola”, on acoustic guitar, the response

,was j'oyously loud. “C—O—L—A, Cola.“

Constantly, he theatrically presented his

 

songs 4 carrcssing himself, gesturing.
Rescmbiing a skid-row bum, he stumbled
around the stage. beer bottle in hand as
testimony to the demon "Alcohol."

As was to be expected, Davies was
quite visual while performing songs that
were satirical or poked fun at social
classes. TWO new songs “Low Budget,"
and “I Wish I Could Fly Like Superman,"
were perfect examples. in the former,
Davies, dressed appropriately, sang of
forgoing all the previously adorned
beneﬁts of upper class living.

You’ve been a
misfit all your

life
1
Why don t you
[om the crowd
And come
lnSIde
R. Dawes
Misfits '

"T 9 air is mine, my teeth are myown,
Bui everything else is on permanent
loan.”

The rockch were also done well. A full
version of“You Really Got Me," and "All
Day and All of the Night," were well
played and extremely well received. it
seems that Davies is now content to let the
band play their best songs. The concept
album is behind them and this was
emphasized by the performance of only

one song from Preservaiion from among
that category of Kinks' albums.

" Kinks may Still Have nweﬁe

The very best moments of the show'
came when the band performed the
ballads in which Ray sang his more
cmotional, mcaningful‘compositions. He
introduced the title song from Misﬁts, as
“written by a misfit, about a misﬁt.” The
song is almost a proclamation that his
deﬁance to “join the crowd” has not been
in vain. Again piayingthe acoustic guitar, '
in contrast to Dave's electric, Ray seemed
honestly moved while performing it.

“Celluloid Heroes,” from Everyone's
In Show Biz was the most impressively
arranged and performed song of the
concert. As on several other songs, the
band was complimented by the addition
of a tenor sax and trombone. The stark
realities of the motion picture medium
were stirrineg portrayed as Ray sang —— “I
with my liji: was a non—stop Hollywood
movie show . . . Celluloid Heroes never
really die.“

The one concession Davies seems to
have made to time is an casing up of his
cynical, bitter feelings towards the music
business. The Kinks current show reﬂects
this. They know how far they have come.

Ray introduced "A Rock and Roll
Fantasy" for all the good bands that are
‘not around anymore. When he came to
the line. “You might be through, but i've
just begun,“ the audience responded with
cheers. Ray Davies has decided that his
music is important, and he might as well
strive to perfect it - and the show.

After playing an encore, the Kinks left
the stage hastily. Except for Ray Davies.
He moved to the front, shaking hands in
the audience. Basically, it is his show. as
long as they sing from “A Rock and Roll
Fantasy" — But for all we know, we
might still have a way I0 go.
