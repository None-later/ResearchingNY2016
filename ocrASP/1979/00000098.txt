SEX SESSIONS

A small unaccredited California
University '5 known ' for“'c'otiises on
sexual techniques has announced
plans to open up a second campus in
Hawaii. '

More University has reportedly
purchased land on the island of
Oahu where it will offer such courses
as the "Fundamentals of
Sensuality." The course is described
a 17-hour weekend marathon
concentrating on “the production of
pleasure in the human body.“

I he Honolulu Advertiser says
that a one—day cottrsc. called “Basic

Sensuality." includes a live
demonstration of an hour-long
Icmalc orgasm. induced “by a

“skilled male instructor" on a female
Instructor. A university teacher is
qttoted by The Arlverliser as saying
that site used to demonstrate three-
, hour-long orgasms but that “three
hours \vasjusl too long."
llte instructor added: “There is no
way anyone can deity that sex is a
wonderful thing and that it is sorely
abused in our society. It isn't
lattening. It doesn't cause acne. it's
not taxable . . . so why not enjoy it?
Matty people just don't know how."

QUAKE FAKE?
Doctor John Derr, a scientist with
file US licological Survey. says that
mysterious glowing lights may
provide a tip-off that an
earthquake is coming.

Derr cites recent reports in the
I'eople‘s Republic of China when.
shortly before an earthquake struck.

thousands of people say the night
sky lit up almost as if it were
daylight. The strange white and red
lights in the night were seen as far as
200 miles away form where the giant
quake struck a few hours later.

Derr says the mysterious lights
may be produced by stress changes
in rocks that contain particles of
quartz. He says the stress changes
could trigger a glowing effect that
ttould be visible to the naked eye.
Derr suggests it may soon be
possible to develop electrical
monitoring methods to predict
eatthquakes.

 

PRICE PROBE

I‘ood prices are highcrthan ever in
tlte United States. but Americansare
not the only ones being hit in the
pocketbook.

A survey by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture of food prices in [6
world capitals shows that when it
comes to prices for certain foods.
Americans could consider
themselves very fortunate.

'ln «I'okyo. for example sirloin
steak goes for $15.87 a pound;and in
Copenhagen steak is $8.60 a pound,
wltile in Washington. DC. steak is
“just” $3.02 per pound.

SPEEDY SPERM

A errgia Wofcssor of medicine
says that do-it-yourself artificial
insemination may be just around the
corner.

Doctor Armand Karow of the
Medical College of Georgia says that
the techniques for collecting.
lrcc/ing and storing sperm have
become so effective and simple that
it is now technically possible for a
woman to artificially inseminatc
herself in the privacy of her own
home.

Ihe doctor adds that “as easy as
artificial insemination is to perform.
we caneven imagine a normal couple
selecting semen from a panel of
lainous people and doing home
insemination."

Karow says there is still at least
one little—understood side effect
trout using frozen sperm: he says
studies have found that more boys
titan girls are produced.

SMOKERS DELIGHT

Ihe results of a recent consumer
study indicate that many people may
select the brand of cigarette they
smoke on the basis of its name. not
just its taste.

Iltc magazine Decision Sciences
says that groups of volunteers were
given two dffcrent kinds of filter-
tlpped cigarettes to smoke — one a
masculine brand called From-

.l

m as aw 

W you, and the second a fern:
initte line called April. What the
volunteers were not told was thatthe
cigarettes in both packages were
identical.

Sure enough. most ofthe women
who tried both brands rated the
Frontiers/nan as being hotter,
stronger. harsher and less enjoyable
in taste titan the Aprils. Men. on the
other hand. generally indicated a
taste preference for the more macho-
sounding Frumierxman.

POLL-UTION

A nationwide public opinion poll
has found that the majority of
Americans favor tougher laws to
protect the enviornment against
pollution. even if those laws result in
higher consumer prices.

The nationwide study. conducted
by the Bureau of Social Science
Research in Washington, DC.
questioned more than l000
Americans across the US.

Fifty-three percent of those
questioned agreed that “Protecting
the enviornment is so important that
requirements and standards cannot
be too high. and continuing im-
provement must be made regardless
of cost."

At the other end of the spectrum.
only l0 percent felt that: “Pollution
control requirements and standards
have gone too far.”

The remainder sided with an alter-
native in-between that suggested:
“We should now concentrate on
holding down costs rather than re-
quiring stricter controls."

BEGUIIJNO GUILT

The next time you feel the pangs of
guilt eating away at your stomach.
take heart: there may be good reason
for them. '

A new publication just released by
the Consqu Information Center of
the Federal Government's General
Services Adminstration is claiming.
in effect. that without at least some
guilt. people wouldn't be motivated
to do anything.

Among the things the magazine is
crediting the anxiety-producer with
achieving are decent grades in
school. good performance on the job
and reasonable relationships with
loved ones.

Psychiatrists are not so sure.
however. They claim that. on the
contrary. guilt can cause failure at
school or at work and even result in
nightmares or attempted suicide.

ALPO ON A BUN?

A leading food scientist says that
there's more nutrition in Alpo
dogfood than in a drive-in ham-
burger.

Doctor Michael Jacobson. a
director of the Center For Sciencein
the Public Interest. claims that the
nutritional value of pet food often is
higher than many of the foods we
humans are served.

Jacobson says. for example, that
Alpo not only beats out fast food
burgers. but is superior nutritionally
to pork chops. shrimp. boiled ham
and even sirloin steak. What about a

big Atpo with lettuce and onions to
go?
