Bob Proubr’s Layoff Is Finished

by David Osborn
I Bob Proulx hadn't engaged in
high jump competition for over three
years and he was a tad edgy one
month ago at William College. He
lowly peeled off his blue and white
Albany State warmup stilt and took
; jittery position before approaching
he bar. Moments later he lay in thc
ushiony pit and the bar. set at 6—2.
adn’t moved at all.

“The layoff hurt somewhat
cause i feel stronger than in high
hool but N be much strongerifl'd
ontinucdjumping." Proulx, a Dane
nior said this week. “I was happy i
laced at that ﬁrst meet and it felt
cod. 1 quickly became assimilated
to the routine again and everything

rcw back into my memories of
._ I ack."
'. t' 7 After a ﬁne track career at
- uccnsbury High in Glens Falls.
oulx enrolled at Potsdam State.
cre the track program was
ncclcd the year before he arrived.
oulx wasn‘t aware of that until he
chcd the campus. He stayed on at
tsdam lhrcc years for academic
sons and came here this fall for
adcmics and the chance to get
ck into track.
’ “l was going to college more for
_ education and track was
focondary all along." Proulx
explained. “Originally I thought
75thcy had a team at Potsdam since a
friend of mine had just graduated
and competed there for four years. But
the student government up there
disbanded truck and cross country
because they said they weren‘t

spectator sports." I
l’roulx decided to transfer during

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
    
  
 
  
  
 
  
 

 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 

the fall of his junior year mainly for
academic reasons. "l'm an
anthropology major and a Prof. of
mine told me Albany had a great
Anthropology Depanmcnt and l
shogld give it a try." Proulx said. “i
assumed that one of the four
University Centers would certainly
have a track team and that was an
added bonus."

He came here last spring and
spoke with Dan: track coach Bob
Munscy. Although he had only
jumped four times in the prccccding
three years, Proulx looked forward
to competition once more. "i
thought Munscy was a little crazy. a
very nice man and he obviously
knew his track very well.“ Proulx
remembered.

Proulx is tall. 6' 3“ on the button.
and slim with medium-length black
hair. Munscy wanted him to run
cross country but they never got
together on the matter and he satthc
campaign out. He started to train in
the Auxilliary Gym in November
with a jumping bar.

“it‘s funny to be a ﬁrst your man
on a team and also be a senior which
means it's your last loo." Proulx —
pronounced Pru w said. “i was the
alien and a real newcomer so Ijust
held back to act: ltow thcy'd accept
me. like anybody docs wltcn they
experience something new. I could
hich handled it if they hadn't
accepted me; but luckily they did."

One day in practice. Munscy was
yelling. “l’ru. Pru, l’ru." at the Dane
and suddenly stuck with the name
“Prunes” as a tag for the senior.
"Having my background as an
anthropology major. i may have a
different perspective on a sports
team." he said. “i don‘t make it a
habit. but sometimes I look at the

"Academics is still. and always
will, be number one with me. i think
coming to Albany was the smartest
thing i ever did. for academics and
sports. Sports is just fun. it‘s a
distraction and a release from your
academic pressures. Competition
and daily workouts are also good for
your mental discipline in addition to
keeping you physically in shape."

Proulx, along with Dan Ehring.
gives the Danes the ﬁnest pair of
high jumpers they‘ve ever had.
according to Albany assistant coach
Mark Dalton. in the opening most of
the season. they both cleared 6' 2".
Proulx also runs the hurdles and
made the final at Williams.
Outdoors. Munscy hopes to enter
him in the 400intcrmcdiate hurdles.

.At RP] last month. Proulx pulled a
rear-end muscle and was
considerably hampered all
afternoon. He was also burdened by
a multiplicity of events. “That's one
thing that made it all familiar; in the
middle of the highjump your hurdle
heat is called and you have to quickly
change your sneakers. then your
name is called for highjump and you
have to change back." he said.

Proulx jumped 6‘ 0" and took
third behind Ehring and an Engineer
whojumpcd 6‘2" to win. in order to
prepare him for the long hurdle racc
outdoors. Munscy inserted the
senior into the 440 and Proulx said
he was thinking about that all
afternoon.

The following week at i’lattsburgh
l’roulx added yet another event to
his agenda. Munscy inserted his
standout in thc longjump and in his
first attempt ever in the event he
leaped a surprising 2()'-l0“ to take
third place. lit: also continued at the
same plateau in the high jump by

with a third place finishin thc hurdle
cvcnt.
l’roulx was impressed with his in-

itial longjump outing and showed a'

desire to continue with the dis-
cipline. A couple of weeks ago be im-
proved to 2l'-3" in the event and ac-
tually won the competition in a meet
at Union. 'lltc height in the high
jump stayed the same in Schnectady
and again l’roulI. was third in thc
hurdlt: event with a 7.4 clocking.
Last week at Army he seemed to
have regained his oldjumping form.
l‘roulz easily went along clearing 6

Albany mark by clearing the bar at
6—4“. Hc barcly knocked the bar off
at 6‘6" and that height seems
within his reach in the immediate
future. He has already qualiﬁed for
the State's and could be a surprise
challenger there.

“i work at sports and iccrtainly
enjoy it and i realize that by
collegiate standards l'm fair,"
Proulx said. "Possibly my outlook
would be different if i was an
outstanding athlctc. But people go
where they‘re best at and for me it‘s
anthropology."
