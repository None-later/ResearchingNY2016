Junior diver Chemise (Chuck)
Griswold highlighted the llnes‘ef-

meter diving ﬁnals. which made her
eligible to compete in the Eastern
AIAW Swimming and Diving
Championships this upcoming
weekend. Griswold as well as
Fttzdam. felt that the surprise visit of
the diver's former coach really aided
and inspired her during the competi-
tion. ‘

Griswold's ﬁnal dive of Saturday
evening. a back one-and-one half
somersault. earned 5's and 6's from
the judges which gave gr her the

Eastern qualifying ﬁnish. ' Both
Griswold and freshman Joan
Mielrelharn qualiﬁed for semiﬁnals
in the one meter diving. but
hliekelham was forced to scratch
because of a hand injury incurred
earlier in the neck during practice.

The Danes‘ swimming contigent
placed in two ﬁnal heats. the 200
medley relay and the SO freestyle.
The relay team of sophomore Beth
Thineau. freshman Barb Van Slylte.
senior Patty Dillon. and freshman
Ann Hoch earned a twelth place in
Division B with a time of 2:17.7,
.although three seconds slower than
their preliminary heat time. Hoch

also placed twelth in the ﬁnals ofthe ‘

50 free with a 27.66 time. only .66
seconds off of her school record.
Thrcc'team members competed in
the individual medley and although
unable to qualify for ﬁnals. Fitzdam
noted that they did turn in good per-
sonal times. Hoch. an all around
sprinter. had a second in her heat
with a I:I2 time. Freshman Monica

Rossi swam only .4 seciinds slower in ‘
that event and Van Slyke stroked to
a l:lS.86. time. despite not having
swam the event in competition in
several weeks.

Hoch. the Danes‘ sole entry in. the
50 By. placed fourth in her heat with
a time of 30.45 seconds. The 200 free
relay team of Rossi. Dillon.
Miekelham. and Hoch was unable to
put its “Instant Relay" act together
as they turned in a relatively slow
time of l:57.5. almost ﬁve seconds
slower than their season‘s best time.

“We had only one senior com-
peting. so I feel that next year the
team will be able to fare somewhat
better." Fitzdam said of the long
weekend. "We had a strong nucleus
of underclasswomen and they will
continue to develop. The team is still
initsinfancyandtheyare deﬁnitelya
team of the future — the very near
future. For some 0Lthc freshmen this
was an overwhelming event. but I
feel that next year. with more ex-
perience behind them. they sould be
able to fare somewhat better."

Bossy Has A Gift For Scoring

(AP) It is a gift. Mike Bossy will tell
you. a God-given gift that can't be
taught and is tough to explain. It is a
knack. an ability. a remarkable
talent for scoring goals that has put
him in the National Hockey League
record book. .

Right now, Mike Bossy of the
New York Islanders is the hottest
thing on two skates. He has
developed into an awesome scoring
machine with 50 goals for the season.
tops'irt the NHL. He has scored 27
goals in his last 28 games and hasjust

finished a record-tying scoring
streak of IO consecutive games.

' “I don't want to sound rash, or
anything like that. but l0 games
doesn‘t sound like an awful lot. Tcn's
not that much. really." says Bossy. “I
thought the consecutive game strcuk
would be longer than that."

Gouls have always come easy for
this bushy-haired young mun from
Montreal. but he could have been
playing for one of a dorcn other
NHL clubs who chose ahead of New
York in the I977 amateur draft.

Because of their success. the
Islanders were pretty far down in the
draft rotation -~ No. IS. in fact. That
meant l4 junior hockey players
would be gone before General
Manager Bill Torrey could make his
pick for the Islanders. That's a lot of
talent to wade through and Torrey
thought that Bossy would not be
available by the time the Islanders'
turn come up.

“Two things worked in our favor.“
said Torrey. “First. there were three
or four good defensemcn uvuilable_

So defenders Iiurry Bch and
Robert I’icurd and Doug Wilsonnnd
Brad Maxwell and Trevor .Iohunson
were scooped tip. And Bossy remain-
ed.

“The other thing was that there
were seven or eight right wings
uvailnble."’l'orrcy continued. "All of
them had credentials.“

There was a third thing »7 Iiossy's
reputation as u one-way hockey

could he check'! Was , be tough

John Ferguson of the New York
Rangers und Ron Caron ofthc Mon-
trcnl Cuuridicus wore two who

publicly doubted Bossy‘s defensive
abilities. So Ferguson. with two
first-round picks, drafted DcIiIois
and Ron Duguuy for the Rangers.
Caron picked Mark anicr for thc
Conadicus. All three picks were
made with Ilossy still there for the
taking.

Ferguson. it should he noted. now
works in Winnipeg. And Caron
draws scowls every time he passes

by Rlch Sellgson

Other than “a little tingle” running
through Carmelo Verdejo‘s body,
the four graduating seniors on the
Great Dane basketball squad —— Bill
Bellamy, Barry Cavanaugh. Buddy
Wleklinski and Verdejo — felt no
strong emotions as they trotted onto
the University Gym ﬂoor for pre-
game warmups Saturday night.

Although hosting the Oswego
State Lakers could possibly have
been the ﬁnal home outing of their
college career, the players were more
concerned about winning and
enhancing their post-season chances
than the drama of it all.

Once victory was theirs. however.
they could continue thinking about
an NCAA bid —- one which they
were awarded the following after-
noon —~ but also reﬂect on the
Albany home crowd and playing at
University Gym for perhaps the last
time: '

Bellamy: "We had a good record
at home. We didn't lose this year and
last season we lost only twice at
home."

Cavanaugh: “The last couple of
days I thought it was going to be sad.
Bus then I thought of all the good
things that have happened. Instead

of being sad. I'll be happy. Asfor the
crowd. compared to other schools
we play. this is probably the best
home crowd. When you go to other
places. you can have between 200
and 300. Here you're assured of
l500-2000 on an average night.”

Verdejo: "The crowd helped me
start my career here. They were the
big influence in me making it or not.
I‘ll always love the Albany crowd
even when I come back here as a
spectator."

Wleklinski: ~“Half the people in
crowd seem like they‘re in the game
themselves. I guess that's the way I
am when I‘m on the bench. The peo-
ple here are really into it."

Bellamy. whose quickness and
ballhandling are his trademarks. is
not unfamiliar with the large and
vocal crowd he's grown accustomed
to at University Gym. “We used to
have big crowds there too,“ he said
concerning his ﬁrst two years at Ul-
ster Community College. so

As the bread and butter 'of
Albany‘s starting ﬁve. Cavanaugh
and Verdejo always seem to shine at
home. Cavanaugh cited his two 36‘
point ballgames against Hamilton at
Saturday‘s halftime award

Much of Wleklinski's support at
home games comes from the‘Potter

belongs to.

“The Club‘s" really into it,

'Wleklinski said. "You'll see them at

most of the games. They‘re yelling
and screaming. You can hear them
on the court.

"At halftime tonight. they told me
to shoot more. I did and the shots

No Punches Exchanged In
Rossman’s Title Defense

LAS VEGAS (AP) There was an
abundance ofangry ﬁnger-pointing.
heated accusations and hostile
name-calling. but no blows Were
struck -v and that wasthe problem.

The World Boxing Association's
light—heavyweight title ﬁght that was
scheduled Saturday instead became
a title fiusco. Champion Mike
Rossman and challenger Victor
Galindez never even saw each other
on fight day. as u standoff between
the WBA and the Nevada Athletic
Commission over appointment of
light ofﬁcials caused the bout to be
canceled.

The WBA wanted to name its own
judges and referees. using just one
Nevada official and having the rest
from foreign countries. The Athletic
Commission. however. named its
own Nevndu people to work the ﬁght
and would not back down.

The dispute had surfaced Friday
and a lengthy rnccliugcxtcnding into
Saturday morning failed to resolve

the issue. Still. Rossman. a crowd ol
4,200 at the Caesars Palace Pavilion
and ABC-TV were caught almost
totally surprised when Galindez left
just before the ﬁght was supposed to
start.

The WBA had told the Argenti-
nian that if the ﬁght were staged
without referees it had chosen. it
wouldn't be sanctioned. So in effect.
he wouldn‘t be fighting forthe title.

Promoter Bob Arum of Top
Rank. Inc. tried desperately to
resolve the dispute as ﬁght time
neared. When it became apparent
there would be no bout. he stood in
the center of the ring and said the
fault lay with “your athletic commis-

sion.“ Then he added. “The ﬁghters
want the light to go on."

He had also called the Nevada
Commission "amateurs" who are
ruining boxing in the United States.

Sunday. Arum said that plans are
in the works to stage the title ﬁght
sometime in April.
