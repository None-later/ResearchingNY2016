Army Facility PleaSes Trackmen.

by David Osborn

Last fall during the cross-country
season Albany State indoor track
coach Bob Munsey‘ chatted with
Army coach John Randolph at a
meet in Syracuse and received an
invitation to bringthe Danes to West
Point in February. Not being the
type to turn down such an offer.
Munsey quickly accepted.

Albany kept up their end of the
bargain Saturday afternnon by
traveling to the US. Military
Academy to take part in an informal
competition with the Army Jayvee
squad and the West Point Prep
School. Although results were not
tabulated and team scores went
unrecorded, Army would have taken
the meet by a considerable margin.

But that wasn‘t the point. For the
Danes it was the opportunity to “see
how the other half lives." according
to assistant coach Mark Dalton. The
Cadet facility is among the ﬁnest in
the state and Albany was exposed to
a high level of competition. Some
Albany competitors may have been a
bit intimidated but the awesome
facility was still a treat.

The track measured 200 meters
and was coated with a brand new
tartan surface. “It was an excellent
facility and probably the ﬁnest
indoor track We ever seen." said
Dane Scott James. “it was like a
huge barn that had been completely
done over and it had movable stands
and separate areas for the ﬁeld and
throwing events."

Aside from being overly
impressed with the environment.
James was also one of only two
Danes to win individual events in

addition to Albany's 2-mile triumph.
The freshmen used a ﬁne kick to
overtake the ﬁeld on the ﬁnal lap and
win the Low meter run with a time
of 2:36;'that translates into roughly a
2:2l. 1.000 yard effort.

“1 still don't have enough
conﬁdence in myself to go out in
front and take the early lead.” James
explained. “They‘re always yelling‘at
me from the sidelines to go faster but
I just ignore them. i have to cut a
second off my time to qualify for the
state‘s. There‘s something
psychologically diﬁcult about the
l.000; maybe it‘sjust the number. but
i think of it as reallylong and it‘sjust
over a half-mile."

Albany's team effort was
considerably weakened by the
absence oftwo standout performers,
and the squad may be further
hampered in the future. Mark Lavan
hurt his achillies tendon and didn‘t
run at Army and may miss the
Capital District‘s at RPl next week;
Floyd Bennett missed the pit on his
ﬁrst pole vault and now has a taped
elbow: Jeff Baker has a bad knee and

Eric Schultz has left the team for
personal reasons.

Brian Barnes. a fresh and a
distinct bright spot in what may be
turning into a sour season for
Albany. toppled the school triple-
jump record for the third time this
season. When Barnes entered the
school Garry Washington's mark
from I974 stood at 43‘6" and Barnes
has surpassed that three times most
recently with a 44—l0 leap on
Saturday.

Bob Proulz was the only other
Dane victor. His leap of 2|'-3" was

good enough to take the long jump.
Proulz has been one of the Iquad‘s
‘most consistant performers this
season and with the recent
depletions he may be called on even
more for valuable team points. He
ﬁnished second in the high jump at
6'4". equalling a school record. and
barely knocked the bar from its
position on his third attempt at 6—6.

John Little, a senior, was second
in the two mile run with a 9:32
clocking. “I've stopped listening to
the splits so i wasn‘t sure how fast we
were going. but after the mile markl
looked up and saw the Armv leader
pretty close and i said ‘maybe i can
get him.‘ " Little said. I‘l knew i was
gonna take second regardless and i
ﬁnished just about a half-second
back.

Tony lferretti. normally a 600
yard runner. competed in the 400
meter race and tooklhird for Albany
in 5L7. “That was a tenth ofa second
off the school record and he doesn't
even have his speed down yet. he
should be going much faster.“ said
Dalton. in the 800 meters. Ray
Marrero. a consistent performer all
year. nabbed third in 2100.6.

in the mile Bill Mathis ﬁnished
fifth for the Danes in4128 and he was
a mere ﬁve yards from the leaders at
the end. David Goldberg. a soph
from Wantaugh. recordedalpersonal
best in the race with a 4:36 effort for
the Danes. Bruce Shapiro ran a
1159.2 halfmile to key Albany's win
in the two mile relay.

Albany should do well.

Centre College. the host school, is

22-3 and seeded ﬁrst in Kentucky.
Their tallest starter is 6'4”. and Steve
Curtis. a 6'3" frosh. is the leading
scorer at l5.6 in a balanced attack.
Savannah State. the Danes'ﬁrst op-
ponent. is a high-scoring team with
two 6'8“ starters and the owners ofa
l9-8 season mark.

No matter how Albany fares after
their plane rideinto Lexington, Ken-
tucky sometime Thursday. the
bargaining moves to get them there
will seemjust as dramatic. Although
Sauers and the squad feel they
deserved the eastern bid originally
and the trip south is certainly no gift,
it would seem a Floridian vacationer
named Alexander had a lot to do
with engineering their trip.
