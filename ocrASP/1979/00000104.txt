by Paul Schwartz
Everything went on as expected

nual contest, followed by an awards
ceremony. Then the Albany State
basketball squad took the court to
face Oswego, a team that had
managed only two victories in 19
prior games. There were no real sur-
prises; some alumni were out of
shape. the ceremony was routine,
and the Danes defeated Oswego. 71-

Improved Record
' Albany improved their season
record to 18.6 with the victory, and
in the process of remaining in the
battle for the SUNYAC cham-
pionship and the NCAA playoffs.
the Danes played somewhat
mediocre, but could afford to
against the hapless Oswego great
Lakers. Albany never trailed in the
ballgame and it was their won mis-
takes that kept the ﬁnal score respec-
table.

“We playeda littleflat,” said Dane
coach Dick Sauers. “It's difficult to
play against a teamlike Oswego, but
We must realize that we still have to
go out there and play." I

Cavanaugh. Instead, the Danes let
their fat ride on a perimeter outside

shooting attack, and because of .

some accurate marksmanship.
Albany was simply able to shoot
over the Laker defense.

Accepting the role of leading
scorer for the Danes for the ﬁrst time
this season was Buddy Wleklinski.
Positioned as point guard in the
Albany offense, Wleklinski was able
to launch 10 of his patented long-
range bombs. and seven landed in
theirdesired target. Wleklinaki hit on
a 15-foot push shot to start the game.
and then proceeded to take his hot

selection even further away from the -

basket. Stating that his shooting
range is “25 feet and in." Wleklinski
was left unguarded by the Oswgo
defenders. and by the time the
Lakers were convinced that
Wleklinski could make the shots he
was taking, the Dane guard had
tallied a season-high 15 points.

“I just got hot for a change," said
Wleklinski. “I've been hesitating
when I shoot, but after] hit four or
ﬁve shots, I stopped thinking about

my shot and just put it up naturally."

In the ﬁrst half, the Dane scoring
attack was led by a pair of
sophomore sharpshooters, Rob
Clune and Ray Cesare. Showing a
variety of offensive skills, Clune
scored on jumpshots, drives. and
offensive rebounds while chalking
up 11 points before halftime. Cesare
relied on jumpers from the baseline.
and pumped in nine ﬁrst half points.

Team Effort .

Contrasting the Dane's team el-
fort. the Lakers Were primarilyaone
man 'show. Bill Thciben. Oswego's
scoring n't'achine, averages 22.6
points a game this season. and is not
bashful when it comes to shooting.
Thieben is not surrounded by any
other real offensive threats. and with
an attack that is based around him,
Theiben found time to attempt 23
shots. make 10, and ﬁnished with 23
points.

Leading 34-22 at halftime. the
Danes increased that margin to 16
points late in the game. and with the
contest no longer in doubt, Sauers
went to his bench, replacing
Cavanaugh and Verdejo together to
a rousing ovation from the large
crowd. “I really wanted to take them
out together," Sauers said.

Gymnasts Win Over Bridgewater

With Mary Ann Caperna leading
the way, the Albany State women's
gymnastics team gained their third
win of the season by coming home
from Bridgewater with a 93.3-90.2
victory.

‘Caperna. a junior, competing for
the Danes for the last year since she
will go overseas to complete her

education next fall. highlighted the
meet with’her vaulting effort. She
attempted a yamashita. a class D
jump which classiﬁes as the hardest
move in the discipline, and recorded
an outstanding score of 7.05.

The balance beam was the most
successful event for Albany and the
many high scores compiled may
have iced the win for the Danes.
Caperna turned in another ﬁne per-
formance and took a 7.1 on the beam
while Coreen Palma had a 7.0 and
Kathy Chemoti chipped in with a
6.1.

Atop the uneven bars, Caperna
recorded a 615. But teamate Cindy
Corbane led the Dane charge there
with a 63 score and Barb Shaw pick-

ed up a 5.7. Palma‘s 6.7 on the ﬂoor
exercise was the only notable Albany
result in that event

On Saturday, Feb. 17, Albany
hosted Hofstra and Northeastern
University. The Danes came in third

Albany Reaction Showed Surprise  Relief 

by Paul Schwartz

It was getting late. and the phone
still had not rung. Everyone
associated with the Albany State
basketball team was waiting for the
same thing — news telling if the
Danes were selected to play in the
NCAA Div. III playoffs. The later it
became, the worse Albany‘s chances
appeared. In this case. no news was
deﬁnitely bad news.

The initial call came at about 3:00
on Sunday. Union College Sports
Information Director Dick Sakala
called Bob Ford, Albany's Athletic
Director, and Sakala offered the
Danes an opportunity to compete in
the ECAC Upstate Tournament, a
tourney that is non-advancing and
lacks the prestige of an NCAA
regional. After missing out on a
playoff bid last year, Albany was
selected and won the Upstate Tour-
namcnt,

This was not the news Ford was
expecting. He asked Sakala if the
ECAC invitation meant that Albany
was not picked for the NCAA's.
Sakala said that he had spokento an
NCAA ofﬁcial, and that Pratt In-
stitute had been selected as the
fourth and last team for the NCAA
Eastern Regional in Stony Brook.

“I told him (Sakala) that 1 would
have to talk to our basketball coach.
Dick Sauers, before any decisions
were made," said l-‘ord. "At that
point, I thought we still could
possibly get a bid from out of our
conference."

At 4:30. an Albany phone rang
again. this time at the Sauer's home.
The caller was Ralph Mcsillen in
Kansas City. Mcsillen is in charge of
special events. such as post season

tournaments for the NCAA, and he
had something important to tell
Sauers.

“Ht: called me on Friday to get my
home phone number, in case he
needed it." said Sauers. “On Sunday,
he called to notify me that Albany
had been selected for the Southern
Regional in Danvillc. Kentucky. 1
was surprised — 1 never thought of
that regional."

Sauers was not told speciﬁcally
how his team ended up in the
Southern Regional. “Mcsillen said
that there was along discussion -‘
too long to talk about," said Sauers.

When Buddy Wleklinski
answered the phone a little aftcr4:30
on Sunday, he was ready to hear
good news. Also in the room was his
teammate on the Albany State
basketball squad. Barry Cavanaugh.
Both are seniors. and in their ﬁnal
year us Great Danes, they both
fervently wanted to compete in the
NCAA playoffs, and after their vic-
tory over Oswego the night before,
both were somewhat confident that
their team would be playing in tne
Eastern Regional in Stony Brook
this weekend.

Neither would believe what they
were about to hear.

“It was Doc (Sauers) on the
phone," said Wleklinski. “He told
the that we were not going to the
Eastern Regional. 1 said ‘ah sh———
——.' The he said that we were going to
the Southern Regional. He started
telling me when we were leaving, and
other things, but 1 had no reaction —
lwldn't believe it. 1 expected the

FEBRUARY 27, I979

“He told me that the committee was
in conference for hours, and that
they lllld it strong feeling that Albany
should be put in a regional."

After finding out about Albany,
Sauers was informed that l’ratt was
the team selected to the Eastern
Regional. “1 don‘t think they deserv-
cd any bid," Sauers said. “If their
reasoning was that l’ratt is better
than us, and that was why they pick-
cd them to go to Stony Brook, 1
think they were wrong."

One problem the Danes will en—
counter is in preparation for the
tournament. Sauers usuall has ex-

Eustcrn Regional."

“When I heard Buddy cursing I
thought ‘oh no, not the ECAC‘s
again," said Cavanaugh. “Then he
handed me the phone, and Doc told
me. 1 was shocked. I thought maybe
we would get into the New England
Regional, but never the Southern
Regional."

Although both players were pleas—
cd to be selected for the playoffs.
they each admit that Stony Brook
was their first choice.

“I'd like to ﬁnd out how the
southern teams play," said
Wleklinski, “and it might even be an
easier regional than the Eastern
Regional. But I know that it lot of
'plans were being made M buses were
going to be chartered to go from
Albany to Stony Brook. We would
have had a lot of fans in Stony
Brook."

“1 think I would rather be in Stony
Brook," added Cavanaugh. “l'm dis-
appointed that we didn't get it bid to
go there. 1 thoﬁught we were good

tcnsive scouting reports and specific
game plans for each opponent, but
its of Monday, he knew practically
nothing about Albany's ﬁrst round
opponent, Savannah State College
of Georgia. Besidcstheir known 19-8
recordI there is a limited amount of
information about the Savannah
squad.

"We obviously can‘t scout them.
but they can‘t scout us either," said
Sauers. “I'm going to try to get as
much second hand information as 1
can -— maybe a game film. Bill
Austin (Albany's assistant coach)
will tr to ther as much informa-

fi'eammates Share The Wait, Mixed Feelings

enough to go there and win the
regional. But it doesn't really matter.
just as long as we got a bid
somewhere. I'm glad there was a spot
_for us."

Pratt was the team that beat out
Albany for a bid to the Eastern
Regional, and according to
Cavanaugh, “they deserve it, lgucss.

They did beat Stony Brook by 12' i - 1

points."

“We w‘ere trying to ﬁgure out why
l’rutt got the bid instead ofus,” said
Wleklinski. “and maybe it was
because Pratt was from the
Metropolitan area, and since they
are so much closer to Stony Brook,
they could bring a bigger crowd than
we could. and that‘s why they picked
them. That could be the reason they
picked Manhattanville instead of us
last year.“

Whether Stony Brook or Ken-
tucky. Cavanaugh feels the situation
is still the same. “It's a do or die
situation. No matter where we are.
we still know what we have to do."

5'05 Nlnc members 1 the Dane be ketall tum show how to alt down on the job duringlprlotlco

' #—

tion about Savannah as he can. All
we know now is that they are a good
running team.”

While the Danes are in Kentucky,
Stony Brook, St. Lawrence,
Potsdam, and Pratt will be fighting
to become the Eastern Regional
champion. In past years, the eastern
representatives have fared quite well
in national competition. and with
the Stony Brook team ranked in the
top ﬁve in the nation for Division 111
schools, the regional ﬁgures to be
one of the strongest throughout the
country.

“I feel if we were in the Eastern
Regional, we could have won it,”
said Sauers. “But I‘m just happy to
be in the NCAA‘s. We can go to
Stony Brook to play any time.”

With the added exeitement. travel
arrangements, and facing a virtually
unknown opponent, the importance
of performing well'on the court is
still essential for the Danes.
“Sometimes a trip like this could be
more relaxing for the team,” said
Sauers. “Playing so far away. there
could be less pressure."

Playing in the Southern Regional.
the Danes might suffer from aniden-
tity crisis. There is a team in Georgia
named Albany State, and any out-
sidcr lookingin would automatically
assume that the Albany State listed
in the Southern Regional is the
Albany State from Georgia.

But it isn't. It is the Albany State
from New York, and they will be
playing along way from home, in a
regional they never thought they
would be in. But it is the NCAA
playoffs. something the Danes have
been playing for, even if it is in Ken-
tucky. .
