“ And It’s“ Off To Kntucky

 

by David Osborn

After being denied a bid to the
Eastern Regional of the NCAA
Division lll playoffs early Sunday
afternoon. a potential uproar from
the Albany State basketball team
was coated over when they were
notiﬁed later in the day that they had
been picked to play in the Southern
Regional bracket.
For the Danes. a third crack at the
national championship in the ﬁve-
year old event will begin Friday
night when they are paired with
Savannah St. of Georgia in an open-
ing round game in Danville. Ken-
tucky. Centre College. the host
school. and Lane College of
Tennessee will meet in the other
semiﬁnal with the winners playing
for the title Saturday night.
Although Albany failed to receive
a ticket to the Eastern Regional. the
local committee felt the Danes
deserved to be inthe tournament and
recommended such a move to the
national selection committee. The
six-man group governing the selec-
tion process nationwide then tabbed
Albany to go southward due to a
lack of quality local teams in thttt
region.
“l‘m just happy to be in the tour-
nament but lcttn't see how we were
picked ﬁftlt in our region behind
Pratt." said Dane coach Dick
Suucrs. referring to the school that
received the final eastern bid. "l‘m
gonnajnst try and get as muchinfor-
mation on the teams in the regional
as possible, but I know they haven't
done well nationally lately."
Should Albany win the southern
bracket. they would advance to the
quarterﬁnals in the 32-team tourna-
ment. Preliminary NCAA plans
schedule the southern champ to host
the winner of the Great Lakes region
in the quarterﬁnals. Those plans
could be switched by the national
committee but in all likelihood
Albany would host that game if they
can escape from the south unscath-
ed. The ﬁnal four will advance to
Augustana College in Rock Island.
Illinois for the semifinals
on March l6 and I7.
Before the Danes could secure a
slot in the title chase.they had to sur-
vive an extensive scrutiniting
process by regional and national
committees that included debate.
arguments and conference calls con-

necting men from the entire nation.

First. there was the eastern selec-
tion process. Potsdam emerged as
the SUNYAC entrant by compiling
the best record among the three
squads that tied as conference tri-
chantpions. Albany and l’lattsburgh
included. St. Lawrence got an
automatic spot by winning the ln-
dependent Athletic Conference title
and Stony Brook was already

by seven.

“When you analyze the results it
seems just about equal, so for me
personally. it came down to two
things." Bailey continued.
“Plattsburgh won the head-to-head
encounter although I realize it was in
overtime. Then for me. Albanycame
to Oneonta and we beat them by a
point and l’lattsburgh came here the
next week and beat us handily."

Meanwhile. with the dilemma
seemingly solved in favor of
Plattsburgh. and Albany in a virtual
state of limbo. there were other
feelings over the conference phone
line. By now it was about “:30 and
the ﬁve had been talking for halfan
hour. Lcw Alexander of RlT. the un-
ofﬁcial chairman and presently
vacationing in Florida. spoke with
the others from his hotel room.

Pete Finnerty, Pace's athletic
director and another member of the
crew. voiced the sectional side of the
debate. He was arguing vociferously
for Manhattttnville. 17-9. Finnerty
admitted to knowing very little
about the upstate teams and said he
had been placed on the committee to
give it more ofa balance. He said he

'factor against Plattsburgh now was
their two losses to Potsdam. a team
already in the tourney.

“Beating Stony Brook in that last
game was certainly a good pitch for
Pratt." said Hobart‘s Athletic Direc-
tor William Stiles, the final member
of the group. “They also won their
conference. they had an excellent se-
cond half ofthe season and so many
of their losses came out of Division
lll."

Bailey says he remembers
recommending teams for the
regional and some for a national
ranking and nothing else deﬁnitive
when the call ended shortly past
noon. There was no positive talk of
putting in a ﬁfth poasible squad and
any debate had left Plattsburgh atop
Albany anyway. At this time, the
Danes were even slipping from lim-
bo.

Such advisory committees exist in
each of the eight sections and their
purpose isjust that; advisory. Alex~
under as chairman then joined in
another conference call with the
national committee and offered his
suggestion for the Eastern Regional.
Apparently. using his prerogative as

guaranteed an at-large bid.

So when the five-member NCAA
eastern advisory board picked up
their respective telephones tojoin in
on a conference call at “:00 am.
Sunday morning. their major chore
was to pick a fourth team to ﬁll the
tit-large bcrth. leading that list of
cligiblcs were Albany. l’ratt,
Plattsburgh. Manhattanvillc. Elmira
and Staten lsland.

“Before anything else we wanted
to decide betwectt Albany and
l’lattsburgh." said Dave Bailey.

ofthc selection committee members.
over the phone. “That evaluation
came to a virtual tossup. But
historically our conference is one of
the toughest Division III leagues iii
the nation and i felt we deserved two
teams in the tourney."

The matchup was impossible to
decide. according to Bailey. Albany
ﬁnished Ill-6, l’lattsburgh l7-8; tltc
Danes lost to their lone f)iv.l foe.
Colgate.and l’lattsburgh beat theirs.
Vermont. Both squads went into
overtime before succumbing to
Hamilton and the Dltllctt lost to
llartwick by l2. the Cardinals lost

relies on others for upstate informa-'

tion.

“To be perfectly frank with you l
don’t know much about the basket—
ball upstate and lrcly on Alexander
to fill me in." said Finnerty from ltls
Manhattan office near City llttll.
“I‘m an old friend of Doc Saucrs but
we have to try to get tnorc teams
frotn down south in the tournament;
I've already got the Manhattanvillc
people yelling at me down here."

Nearing “:45. it came down to
Pratt and l’htttsburgh. Despite a
lackluster I5—9 mark. l’rutt had im-
prcs ve credentials. Six of their

cs came to Division II squads
and one to Division l LlU. The
leading plus for Print was their 95-83
witt over Stony Brook Saturday
night that was fresh on everybody‘s
mind and also give thetn the
Knickerbocker Conference title over
Stony Brook.

During the discussion of l’ratt. l3.
Wayne Sunderland. Pratt's Athletic
Director. left the conversation over
an obvious conflict of interests.
Nearing l2:00. the four men still par~
ticipating brought the decision to a
vote and Pratt got the nod. A major

chairman. he put forward Albany as
a strong fifth by himself.

So now a conference call existed
between the eight regional chair-
mans and Ralph Mcsillen. the
Associate Director of Events for the
NCAA and the man directly in
charge of Division III basketball.
Since Alexander is not an official
national committeeman. ltc gavo his
picks ﬁrst and then hung up while

Danes PasSed Over In East; Picked For Southern Bid

the Danes‘ fate was quite literally'
tossed among men from ocean to
ocean.

According to Mcsillen. Alexander
presented his four and then made a
strong pitch for Albany. while also
mentioning Plattsburgh. and ex-
pounded on the Danes' prowess and
said he felt they deserved to be in the
tournament. Then he returned to the
sun-baked beaches of southern
Florida without knowing if his
recommendations had been ap-
proved.

“Wc're looking for teams that are
eligible to play and deserving to play
in the tournament,“ said Mcsillen
from Kansas City yesterday. “We
felt Albany State deserved to be in
the tournament. We‘ve moved
qualified teams around before and
the SUNYAC conference has a very
good reputation because of their
past success in the tournament."

Mcsillen explained that the south
is a relatively weak spot for Division
III basketball and last year two teams
in the regional came from ottt ofthc
area. William Penn. a midwastern
school. is playing in the western
region this weekend so the trend con-
tinues. In some years spots in the 32—
team chase have been vacant rather
than fill them with mediocreteams.

The main casualty resulting from
Albany‘s bid was the proposed
fourth tcatn from the southern
region. in tut eight-state area encom-
passing 23 teams. the south has tltc
same advisory connnittce and to
sliow the precariousness of their
decision. Transylvania St. of Ken-
tucky was felt not to be deserving of
the spot by the nationalcommittcc.

“I wanted the team from my
region to get in there so l wasn‘t in
favor of Albany State. you might
say." said Willie Shaw. the Athletic
Director at Lane. with a chuckle
yesterday from Tennessee. "But the
committee is essentially looking for
the best team and my fourth spot was
rejected and after a long debate and
discussion. Albany was in."

Show is the southern advisory
chairman and also a member of the
national group so he was involved in
the cross-continental debate that
eventually saw the Danes get a bid.
He said that aside from results, there
really is little realistic chance for him
and others to be up on a particular
region otltcr than their own. They
took the word of Alexander that
Albany was a solid ﬁfth in the east
and deserved a shot.

Alexander was unavailable for
continent attd even a search to locate
his Floridian hotel was futile. Yet,
from all apparent evidence his word
plnccd Albany as a strong choice
over l’lattsburgh. The national com-
mittcc of course had 32 otltcr
positions to quibble over and after
three hours. they tthuicsscd with
their decision.

Finnerty and Sundcrland bothex-
pressed satisfaction over Albany's
delegation to Kentucky and Bailey
was surprised l’lttttsburgh was pass-
ed over in favor of the Danes. Mc-
sillen said it will be interesting to see
how a New York State school fares
down south and hinted that the catn-

petition mtty be a little lighter and

Alumni Quad Election Questioned

 

Council Procedures Investigated

by Steven Ostcr

Recent Central Council elections
to select two representatives from
Alumni Quad have conic uttder fire
due to alleged deviations front man-
datory procedure.

The first election. held two weeks
ago, was ruled invalid after it was
learned that ballots were not distri-
buted to Brttbacltcr Hall. A new clcc
tiott. which ends today. has also been
assailed when it was revealed that
mandatory ASP ads announcing the
ballot had not been submitted. ac-.

Lonsbury said that the earlier elec-
tions were invalidated after candi-

‘date Marvin Fermin filed protest,

citing the lack of ballotting in Bru-
bachcr Hall as grounds. Lonsbury
said that. after informing SA Presi-
dent Pttul Fcldntnn of the situation,
Feldman "said that they would be
back the next day."

Elections Commissioner latte Bei-
bcr acknowledged the problem. but
said that Brttbachcr was overlooked
