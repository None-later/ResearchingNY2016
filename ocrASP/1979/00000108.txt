.L‘exTax

it's difficult to say whether this is a
step forward or a step backwards:
The internal Revenue Service
reports that the tax forms for 1978
have been written on a level for
eigth~to ninth-graders to unders-
tand.

The tax forms of previous years
had been designed for 12th and
higher grade levels.

Venusian Vibes

Dramatic and owcrful lightning
storms have been detected on the
planet Venus by a recent space probe
sent to that planet by the Soviet Un-
ion.

'|'he Russian Novosti Press Agen-
cy reports that some ofthe bursts of
lightning were so powerful that they
triggered rolls of thunder that
resoundcd for i5 minutes.

The existence of electrical storms
of Venus was unkown until the
Vcnera 12 landing Craft settled on
the Venusian surface Decembeerst.
Soviet researchers say the evidence
indicates that the atmosphere of
Venus is “very much more alie" than
that of the earth.

Dreamy Drug

Government Researchers have
come up with a bizarre new drugthat
reportedly causes subjects to begin
dreaming.

Investigators at the National In-
stitute of Mental Health claim they
have been able to induce so-called
RIL‘M Sleep in ormal volunteers us-
ing a drug called “physostigmine”
(pronounced FLSOS-Tig-Mine).
REM. or rapid eye movement. sleep
is the stage of sleep when dreaming
occurs.

According to the report in The
General Archives afﬂiyelu‘ulry, the
drug-induced dreams are similar to
spontaneous REM dreams both in
content and in “vividncss. un-
usualness and cmotionality."

Best In The West
West German women have form-
ed a trade union for 14 million
“downtrodden” wives.
the Union was formed by (ierhild

mac

Heers housewife who says thousands
of women have agreed to pay about
50 cents a month for dues.

According to chcr. the union
members will not refuse sex or go
slow in the kitchen for more
housekeeping money.

She says. however. that
housewives will be prepared to strike
for things like more nursery school,
cheaper baby food and a later start
to school lessons in the morning.

Space Wamlng

The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration says its latest
calculations indicated that the giant
skylah space station will crash to
earth late this summer. and that
about 500 chunks of metal should
survive the ﬁery plnge and impact of
thereath.

NASA scientists are estimating
that nearly .10 tons ol'debris will sur-
vive reentry. including partsofa film
null and an airlock. each weirhing

  

W

alch '

4000 to 5000 pounds.

I The bad news from NASA isthat
no one can predict where all this
debris will hit.

Space agency mathematicians
have calculated that the chance of a
piece ofskylab striking a city of more
than 100,000 population is about
one in seven.

NASA says that when skylab
begins to break up. sometime
between August and September. it
will reate a drnrriatic. visible path or
sparks across thesky more than 4000
miles long and 100 miles wide. The
agency claims there is nothingat this
point science can do to prevent the
SS-ton space station from crashing
to earth.

Sun-Gory?

A new Congressional study es-
timates that American Doctors per-
formed 2 million unnecessary sur-
geries during 1977. at a cost of $4
billion to the patients.

The report prepared by the House
Subcommittee on Health. chaired by
John Moss. says that these un-
necessary surgeries resultcd in the
loss of [0,000 lives.

The Subcommittce is calling on
the Health, Education and Welfare
Department to require second
opinions in cases of highly elective
surgery.

HM. Note

A health food specialist says that
the only way to end warfare on the
earth is to encourage world leaders
to consume lots of natural foods
and grains.

Doctor Johm Christopher told a
Chicago not! ymposiurn that we will
not have world peace “as long as we
have a lot of constipated warriors sit-
ting around thc peace table."

It is Christoper's belief that anti-
soeial aggressive behavior, along
with 90 percent of all illnesses. stem
from an inability to eliminate toxic
wastes from the body.

To rectify this problem.
Christoper would have our leaders
primarily eat fruits. vegetables.
grains. nuts and seeds.
