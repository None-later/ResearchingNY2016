But, where

ell, here we go again. Last
week, ifyou care to remember,
we visited Albic's and The
Rat. This week we take
somewhat of a step up, and
check out two of Albany's noteworthy
dclis, Platt's Place and Joe's Caterers.

Platt's Place is located at 44 Wolf
Road, next to the Chalet lnn. Upon ﬁrst
glance it looks like a cafeteria; this isn‘t
too surprising, because it is a cafeteria.
There is a stack of trays, and a metal
railing to slide them along. And there is a
lady behind the counter who asks,
“Whattya want?" ——just like home (here).

It took me a while to order, because l
didn‘t really know what 1 wanted, and
because I needed cxtratimeto copy down
this:

"We lake pride in Ihefacr that we cook
our own turkeys and lap rounds and
steam our corned beef on the premises.
We also prepare all our ice cream, soup,
salads. mayonnaise, and Russian
Dressing from scratch on the premises. "
I ﬁnally ordered from the choices on
the big board behind the counter — a
triple decker sandwich: salami, corn beef,
and pastrami, with lettuce. it comes with
Russian Dressing and tomatoes. which I
rejected. The prices are also listed on the
big board. You might like the sandwiches.
You won't like the prices. Triple decker
sandwich prices range from $2.25 for a
BL'I‘ with Russian Dressing (yucch) to
$4.95 for shrimp salad, with egg and

do you go?

tomato. My triple decker came out to
$3.80.

Chip, you might ask, is $3.805ucha big
deal for a triple decker sandwich? Well,
yes -~ especially when the third layer is
comprised solely of lettuce and tomatoes.
Since I don't like tomatoes, the
waitress/sandwich maker suggested 1
have my sandwich on only two layers. She
still charged me for three. Oh, well.

While we‘re talking dollars, I guess I
should add that Platt's charges extra for
extras. Extras in this case are: Cheese
(Swiss, Provolone, American): .35,
Tomatoes: .30, Onion: .10, Bacon: .75
(the bacon looked incredibly gross), Cole
Slaw: .20, and Eggs: .30. So, for my $3.80,
I got a sandwich consisting (on two
layers) of pastrami, corned beef, and
salami, with lettuce thrown in for texture.
I can‘t say it was a bargain.

How did it taste? Not bad, 1 guess. The
meat was of a pretty high quality, the rye
bread good. The lettuce was more brown,
however, and the mayonnaise was, well,
different than the Hellman's l have come
to know and love. It was home-made, as
they said, but clear and watery ’ not very
good. The limits of good taste prevent me
from using a really effective metaphor.
'l‘he sandwich was better than average,
but for the prices they charge, that wasn‘t
quite enough.

Oh, yeah, one more thing: there are
large photographs in the dining area. The
pictures were taken by one Martin
Benjamin, who, judging from his

subjects, seems to hate people. The
pictures are of slouching teenage girls in

map, some nut wearing glasses that said
(the glasses, not the nut) Woogie, and
many other inspiring shots. We sat near

the fat guy staring at us, which was about .

as appetizing as the runny mayonnaise.
Bon appetite.

Our next stop was Joe‘s Caterers, at
85] Madison Avenue. Outside, in a
display window, there is an article about
Joe from the Albany Times Union (Joe‘s
has also been mentioned bythe New York
Times as a place for legislators and
knowing Albanians to eat) about Joe‘s
life. First off, his last name is Kulik.
Second, he was born in Albany in I907.
Third, and to me, most important, his

.wife and daughters were brought up with
“dill pickles, frog‘s legs, and chopped liver
in their blood." Right.

Joe's clientele is not exactly what you‘d
call collegiate. Most of the business
comes from people like “Cy, Roz, Sam,
Marty," and their friends. They like to
talk about Florida and condominiums.
their usons the doctors,“ and every other
stereotyped cliche one could think of.

Upon entering, i expected to be seated
by the kitchen. 1 was. 1 was given my
menu, which is important 7 Joe‘s is a
restaurant. it is complete with waitresses,
and checks # this also means you might
want to tip, but that‘s up to you,
tightwads.

ll'the rumors are true, and we are about
to enter the war that will destroy

mankind, then '1 wholeheartedly
recommend Joe‘s — live it up while you
have time. ll, however, we are goingto be
around a while, don't go to Joe's until the
next time your parents came up — the
prices are unbelievably high for college
budgets. Unlike Plan's Place, though, it's
worth it.

The prices on triple dcckers range from
$2.75 for a Page Hall Special (Chicken
Salad, Lettuce, Mayonnaise, and
Tomato) to $5.50for Shrimp Salad, Eggs,
Tomato, Lettuce, and Russian Dressing.
Sandwich prices span from $l.25 for
peanut butter andjelly to(get this)$l0.00
for caviar, egg, and onion. l ordered Joe‘s
Deli-Medley, which consisted of Spiced
Beef, Corn Beef, and Salami, with lettuce,
tomato and Russian Dressing. Again I
skipped the Russian Dressing and tomato
(l had mayonnaise). The price for this
little extravaganza was $4.15.

Boy, was it worth it. With the exception
of the watery mayo (again home-made),
this was the tastiest, largest, most filling
sandwich l have ever had in my life. It‘s
more than a meal —— it‘s the master pigout
of them all. The triple decker is cut into
four sections; l was full after two.
However, in the truest of journalistic
integrity, I forced the other half down. I
couldn't move the rest of the night.

Joe's is a place for those with hearty
appetites and wallets. If you really want
to try it, bring a date and split a triple
decker  you shouldn’t be disappointed.
And say hello to Joe w he's a nice guy.
