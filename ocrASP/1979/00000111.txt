There‘s this off~cunpus student apart-
ment thatl know of. In most respects, it's
an average dwelling. Small living room.
several bedrooms at varying size. tu'ce kit-
chen. and excessive rent. However. some-
time mound nine o'clock. on almost every
Wednesday night. this typical apartment
begins to undergo some transformations.

Brian Kurtzer

One. or maybe two at a time. guys
arrive at the apartment. Some bn‘ng large
quantiﬁes of beer. And small quantiﬁes of
pot. That. of course. is not unusual.

Once then: are about six guys present.
they sit down in the kitchen. around a
circular. folding table vi bich has replaced
the regular. wooden model. The original
table has been pushed off to the side.

Before each man is an indentation in
the table into uhich the) each tempt} the

contents of their uallets. The center of
the table is made oi a green. felt—like
material uhich ts “om aunt in sexeral
