f you were lucky, you saw
(SUNYA music professor)
Leonard Kastle's ﬁlm, “The
Honeymoon Killers", when it
appeared on campus last
weekend. Then again. "lucky" is probably
not the right word. That is. unless you’re
into contemplating “the sordid banality
of evil," to borrow one of Kastle‘s
comments. Or, and this is more to the
point, unless you are into art. Art in the
fullest sense of the word.

“The Honeymoon Killers," which
Kastle wrote and directed, recounts the
criminal careers of Martha Beck and
Raymond Fernandez, the last two people
to be executed at Sing Sing. It depicts a
conrse and ugly world in which criminals
are ruthlessly amoral and their victims are
annoying and selﬁsh — at best pitiful.
Nothing is romanticizcd. Crimeis not fun
or sexy, or even thrillingly awful. It is
awful — period.

A line cast brings Kastle‘s script to life.
Tony Lo Bianco as Ray, Shirley Stoler as
Martha, and. Janet Fay as Mary Jane
Higby. are particularly masterful.
Basically. the movie centers around the
Martha Beck character. who Kastle
described as “a lovelorn woman, feeding

herself on movie magazines, who really
wrecked her life because of her obsessive
passion.“

Kastle chose music from a Mahler
symphony to underscore Beck‘s “inner
torment and craziness."

A New York Times critic who reviewed
the movie in I970. when it first came out.
said the film “places Kastle among the
important deliberate artists of his
medium." However, he called the Mahler
music “the only serious failure" in “The
Honeymoon Killers," as it “oversells
every climax." He found this odd,
considering Kastlc‘s musical background.
Kastle, who firmly rejects this
particular criticism. is indeed more
experienced in making music than he is in
making movies. “The Honeymoon
Killers“ is his first, and thus far his only
cinematic endeavor. Yet he has been
involved in music all his life. Encouraged
by “typical Jewish parents,“ the kind he
says, who went “into fits ofecstasy when a

taking piano lessons as a young child.
Later, he attended the prestigious Curtis
Institute of music. There he felt culturally
isolated. He was studying amongst “the
cream of the crop, but it was sour cream.
They knew nothing but music.“

To satisfy his hunger for variety, Kastle
began supplementing his education by
attending summer sessions at Columbia
University. At Columbia, Kastle “got
heavily into politics". He became
involved with a leftist political group.

“But my left wing days ended with a
bang,“ he explained, “when I realized that
the left is more facist than the right could
ever be. You have more of a chance of
saving your freedom from the
conservatives in America than you have
from the left wing in America."

Freedom is quite important to Kastle.
And he doesn't secit anywhere today. He
speaks in terms of comparative evil. “As
bad as South Africa and Rhodesia are."
he says, “they‘re not nearly as bad as East
Germany or Russia. They‘re not putting
people in insane asylums, injecting them
with drugs, and certifying them as legally
insane because the people are against the
regime." He adds, “There never would
have been a Russian Revolution if the
Czar, as bad as he was, was as bad as the
Communists. The Czar, at least, put them
in prison and released them. That‘s how
Lenin and Stalin and Trotsky were able to
get out and do a revolution. The
Communists don‘t release you. I mean,
they put you away . . . "

Kastle sees some hope for Americans
today in that they seem to be moving
politically towards conservatism. “I think
the example is now starting to become
very, very clear that the really precious
thing is freedom," he says, “It‘s the left
where it‘s disappearing more than the
right." . .

Despite this glimmer of hopefulncss,
Kastle is far from optimistic about
America today. “We are living in an
absolute cultural cesspool," he insists.
“We are ruled by products.” The word
product comes up again and again in
conversation with Kastle. He feels that in
America, products have replaced art,
especially in the motion picture industry.

“Today we have people in the movies
who are — they’re thugs. These people
don't want to make a product and make

continud on as is

 

 

MARCH 2, I979

“We are the Sultans of Swing," Dire
Straits claims in the song-of the same
name, which is quickly becoming their
calling card. They’ll receive no argumen-
ts from the over-capacity crowd that at-
tended their first area appearance Wed-
nesday night at the Hullabaloo. The
highly anticipated performance, by the
latest British band to receive FM ac-

: claim, left no one disappointed.

Dire Straits was preceded by a warm-
up band whose name seemed to escape

,Jack Kutner

 

 

Everyone in the audience. After repeated
I ttempts to find out who it was that was

' Loring my senses, and receiving a dif-
' {fercnt answer every time, i finally settled

gun The Baruga Bandits. (but. don’t treat

'_ Ifthat as gospel).

After a pleasurably short inter-

 mission, Dire Straits took the stage.

,Without comment, they opened with
i‘v‘Down to the Waterline," one of the
stronger cuts from their first (and only)
album. The choice was a wise one. The

. song is fast-moving and got the set off to

a">"proper' start. Then they immediately
went to a slow ballad, “Six Blade
Ktlife," also from the album. The fact
that they were able to hold the crowd
with this ‘non-rockcr‘ so early in the set
is-‘ifestimony lo the quality of their per—
formance.

Now exercising their talents further,
they then played three songs which are
not yet rccordcd.

Although the crowd could never have
heard lItc‘~L' songs before, they listened
attentively nonetheless. The best of the
new songs was entitled “Once Upon a
Time In 'Ihc West". This proved to be
the pattern for the whole night: a
carefully chosen assortment of songs

money. They don't have that lovely idea
that they want to create something, that
they want to stand for something of‘valuc.
That's why we have the kinds of movies
we have.“

When asked if he sees any artists
making movies today. Kastle cites
Bergman. Fellini and Truffeau. As for
American artists. he is stumped.

“But then again. if you asked me about
American composers," he adds wryly, I
can't say many of them are too great
either.“ When Kastle speaks of
composers, he means composers of “real
music". He doesn't want to talk about
“that electronic stuff“. As far as Kastle is
concerned, rock doesn't even resemble
music. “When rock people are referred to
as artists in the newspaper, and thcthings
they do are called concerts ~ it's
shocking . . . That junk. these songs, this
rock: what does it communicate?“ Kastle
questions irrately. “Boredom. stupidity
. . . 'I That, I think, is very. very sad,"
And yet, despite the “cultural
cesspool". despite he "junk" that
cvcryonc‘s listening to and the "pup" that
everyone's watching, Kastle radiates
exuberance and enthusiasm. Perhaps it is
because communication is so very
important to him. And he is :thc to find
outlets for comnnmicalion.

with new cuts mixed in.

The songs were played without a lot of
stage theatrics, but with suitable en-
thusiasm. The stage versions were very
true to the recorded arrangements, with
short, tight jams usually added at the
end. The songs ‘eame to life', as one
would hope for in concert. The tight
rhythm section of Pick Withers on
drums. John Illsledy on bass, and David
Knopler on guitar played simply, but
with excellent clarity. They did their job
well, and that job became more obvious
as the set progressed: to provide an
unobtrusive backdrop for the ‘star’ of
the band, Mark Knopler. Mark writes all
the songs the band performs, does all the
singing, and handles the lead guitar

The set climaxed with the band's
biggest hit (unfortunately also a shor-
tened single “Sultans of Swing". Ob-
viously the crowd favorite, and the

most warmly received song of the night,
“Sultans” flowed frotn start to finish.
The song can be interpreted as
autobiographical with lyrics that em-
phasize Dire Straits no-frills approach to
their music/ “They don’t give a damn
about no trumpet playing band/it ain’t
what they call rock and roll."

The band was callcdd out for two en-
cores, of which “Wild West End" was
the highlight. Also from their album, the
song is a showcase of harmony and
melody. The crowd was ready for a third
CIICOI‘L‘, DUI There Was IIOI‘IC.

It is likely that Dire Straits never will
be playing in a club setting again in this
area. Based on the strength of thcir
pci'l'ormancc Wednesday night, it's a
safe bet that they will be playing lzu‘gcr
halls in the near future. This is a mixed
blessing, since more people will have
the om‘lollunity to catch Ihcir nc.\t ap-
pearance, but without the intimacy that
a small club offers.

communication. Kastle feels that “The
Honeymoon Killers“ “savs a lot about
human condition." He also
communicates through his musical
compositions. Presently he teaches
composition at SUNYA. This enables
him to communicate in yctanothcr way.

Kastle speaks proudly of his students.
He hopes to develop a functioning
composition department herc. Kastle
feels that SUNYA offers an ideal
environment for music because it is not an
isolated environment. His students are
surrounded by much more than just
music.

What lies in Kastle's future? On May
9th, SUNYA will witness an evening of
musical compositions by his students, a
concert which Kastle is very excited
about. As for more personal endeavors,
there is an opera on the verge of
production. a children's opera about to be
written, and several other musical
projects in various stages ofdevelopment.
In addition, Kastle intends to make his
second film this summer. It is something
which he wrote several years ago. It has
taken him time to find someone willing to
produce it.

lint if people are hesitant to put up
money for his work, Leonard Kastle
doesn‘t really mind waiting. lie is creating
art in the fullest sense of the word; art
which satisfies his own standards. And
somehow that is enough.
