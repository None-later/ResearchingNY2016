nwhitcs and whites: an increase in Black
nagerisl positions; efforts to improve the

Over 100 American corporations have

v '3 mean? The desegregation of lunchrooms

uld be enough to prove this. “Equal and

t South African law prohibits the hiring of
l v cks and whites for the some positions, not
y this but also “equal play, etc." and the
- ining programs" are useless principles

South African law. Yet American

Two years after the original declaration of the
principles one hundred U.S. ﬁrms operating in
‘South Africa have ncccptcd them on paper.

In fact. the Sullivan Principles amount to
nothing more' than a few cosmetic reforms to
prettify the ugly face of apartheid. Their
adoption by SUNY‘s trustees asan investment
guide would signify a retreat in the face of
public opinion by the Board —— welcome in
that sense. it is true — but nothing more.

Andrew Young's theory that US dollars
not as a "Progressive force" while proping
up apartheid is nothing but the defense of
a government that talks “human rights"

— but practices “ethnic purity." its
endorsement by Dr. Wharton does not
make it any more believable.

Albany Rap

To the Editor:

We. as residents of Steinmetz dorm. would
like tocxpress our disappointment concerning
the suspension of our R.A. Steve Kleinmun.

On Sunday morning, February 25. Steve
was called into thc State Quud Coordinator‘s
ofﬁce and ﬁred on the spot. thereby giving him
48 hours to leave his room. Although a Quad
Coordinator does have the power to make this
decision, no other staff member was even
consulted about the matter.

We feel the reasons given for Steve being
fired were insufficient. and therefore think this

no specific facts to support the incident.
“An accumulation of events" was the best
explanation received by both Steve and the
dorm members of Steinmetz.

We feel Steve was a fine RA and know our
feelings are shared by many people in
Steinmetz. We do not think it is fair to take
from us. a friend as well as a competent RA.
until conclusive evidence can be shown.

A Representative"Council?

if Central Council is as important a body as some of its members choose to believe,

then one would think that more an effort would bd made to insure fair, honest and ‘

efficiently run elections. Recently though, the election for Central Council representa-
tives held on Alumni Quad has been plagued by a series of problems that can only be
attributed to careless decision making on the part of the Elections Commissioner, who
disregarded certain regulations by omitting a polling place. She has since disregarded
regulations in new elections which were held to supposedly set right old ones.

The Elections Commissioner is in charge of the ballotting that theoretically will fairly
elect your SA President and Vice President, your Student University Seniitors. and your
Central Council members. in turn. these men and women do have the power to
represent you. and decide where your student tax money goes, Therefore, it is utterly
imperative that all of these people are elected fairly. and that all those eligible to vote
are given the chance to do so. This was not done on Alumni Quad, and the more than
nine hundred students there are not getting the representation that they are entitled to
on Central Council.

Without those students being represented. it would be terribly unfair to them if
Central Council voted on anything until proper representation is restored. Although
that may seem obvious to you and me. it wasn't quite that way with some representa-
tives. who were slow to acknowledge the fact that anything at all accomplished during
the ubscnsc of these representatives would be an injustice to those nine hundred.

Yet, Central Council Chairman Drive Ruffo had no qualms about bringing up it
$100,000 plus Dippikill bill with two vacant seats. it took the objections of an Alumni
candidate to show Council that deciding this issue without giving Alumni residents the
say they have it right to is totally unethical.

The backbone of democratic student representation is to have. all students represen-
ted and elected fairly. With this in mind. much greater emphasis should be placed on
the insurance of fairness during the election. The Elections Commissioner must follow
the regulations. polling places must never be omitted and tncticulous honesty must
always be guaranteed. if this is not done. then all that follows. including who gets in.
what gets passed. and what fails to pass. is nothing more than it farce; in shambles.

Arbitrary and capricious deviations from regulations in the name of expediency is as
dangerous as it is obviously wrong. Anything less than total dedication to the guidelines
that the Council themselves set down to insure fair elections is it crime whose
implications goiur beyond the Alumni Quad incident.

it's our Central Council and if some members seem to forget that every now and then.
then we must never forget it. Or else. it may become their Central Council. and that is
not democracy.

Quote Of The Day:

"No Court has the power to overstop a Iogislatlve
branch of power.”
-Dave Ruffo, Chairman of Central Council,
commenting on the SA Supreme‘Court’s injunction
