When Anderson was un-
ceremoniously ﬁred by the Cincin-
nati Reds last November. despite a

. record of four National League titles

and two world championships.
owner George Steinbrcnncr of the
Yankees called it “the biggest boo-

Anderson is Steinbrenner's kind

a fetish for short hair. shavcn chins

He doesn't stray too far from

Myron McGeary, the 6'9" center.
underwent an extensive eight hour
back operation a year ago and he
plays at only 75 percent capacity.
Terry Daily is a good outside
shooting forward and Odell

Williamson. the other guard. is also,

a threat from the perimeter.

Shaw says he has a strong bench
and *he doesn't hesitate to make
changes in the lineup. Robert
Hunter. a forward. is the sixth man
and Derek Jones. 5'9", gives Lane
another fine ballhandling guard in
reserve. The extra legs can be quite
useful especially on a squad that
does so’much running. according to
Shaw.

Strangely. Lane and Savannah are
not particularly intense rivals. The

schools are located some 600 miles
apart. so that may account for the at-
titude somewhat. For the Dragons,
beating Clark in the conference
semis or whipping Noxville College
87-66 in February were more satisfy-
ing than the regular season 8t-7l
triumph over Savannah. according
to Shaw.

Centre was ranked l2th in the
latest national Division [II poll and
with a 22-3 record and the added
boost that comes from being the host
school. the Colonels are top-seeded
with a solid shot at advancing. Their
style is in direct contrast with the
other two squads from the south.
They play patterned ball with a ﬁne
balanced scoring attack.

Steve Curtis. a freshman and
rather small for a center standing
6'3“. is the leading scorer at a 15.6

iclip. Curtis played on a summer
team with Louisville's slam dunk ar-
tist ‘Darrell Grifﬁth and .was
reportedly recruited by several Divi-
sion I schools, but chose centre at the
urging of his school principle and
teachers. according to Colonel assis-
tant coach Rick Wagner.

Centre doesn't run the ball much
and they can play zone or man-to-
man on defense. adapting well to the
situation. Neal Sterba, a forward. is
‘probably the number-two threat
offensively. Matt Vonderbrink. at
5‘8" the shortest starter in the
regional. handles the point guard
chores for Centre. but Scott Gregg.
the other guard. leads the Squad in
assists.

Joe Sandy completes the front line
and is the only four-year starter. He'
is the emotional and inspirational
leader for the Colonels inadditionto
chipping in neatly with l4.0 ppg. The
lineup does not present overbearing
height and Wagner admitted that
Centre does get outrebounded often.
but they make up for it in discipline
and poise.

While Centre displays a squad
within the same essential sphere of
the Danes. the other two entrants in
the regional have a totally different
outlook, Before Albany climbs hack
