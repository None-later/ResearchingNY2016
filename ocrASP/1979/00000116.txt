his name left off of the ballot itself.
It is not known at this time if the
latest election will be contested be-
cause of the missing ad.
Commenting on the Brubacher in-
cident, former Elections Commis-
sioner Douglas Freedman said that
,“ldcologicnlly. one would like to
make every effort to make it as coit-
vcnieat as possible to vote. Pragmat-
ically speaking. however, it is rather

impractical when you take into ac-
count‘the perpetual minisculc turn-
out in Brubacher. During last year's
spring elections, in which'three thou-
sand votes were cast. less than thirty
ballots were‘turned in by Brubachcr.
Besides, it's a short walk to the other
polling places in Alden, and Water--
bury Halls.“

Freedman characterized the elim-
ination of theASP ad as “illegal. The
election regulations specifically state
that there must be an announcement
for all elections."

BOSTON (AP) —' Indiana State All—
America Larry Bird brings ‘back
memories to Red Aucrbgch, the
architect of l3 National Basketball
Association titles with the Boston
Celtics. '

“He‘s a big Cousy." Aucrbach said
Monday, comparing the (Hoot-9
Bird with former Celtics' great Bob
Cousy, a guard noted for his quick
hands and peripheral vision along
with his scoring.

"I never thought I‘d ever compare
anyone with Cousy. but Larry Bird
has those great bands and great vi-
sion," Auerbach said.

Like most national television

Ccltics‘ coach now the club's presi-
dent and general manager, was

Celtics' No. l draft choice last June

scored 49 points and grabbed l9
rebounds as Indiana State com-
pleted a perfect regular season witha
l09-84 victory over Wichita State.

“When he gets anywhere near the
ball, it belongs to him,“ Auerbach
said. “Everyone in the country
knows he can shoot. Other things
impress me more.

“He has a great concept of the
game, a great feel of what‘s going on
between the four lines. He‘s got
patience, he's strong and he's un-
selﬁsh.

“I've seen him play and talked to
him just once. However, I'm going
out to see him in the playoffs. Then.

Rarely are committees praised for anything. Common arguments are that
they take too long to make decisions, and the members really don‘t care one
way or another anyhow. But this past week. the fate of the Albany State
basketball team was in the hands of a group of men on the NCAA selection
committee, and their performance is worthy of acclaim.

This pat on the back is not simply because thecommittcc picked the Danes
for the playoffs. There was no doubt that Albany deserved a bid, but looking
from an objective viewpoint, other schools. most noticeably Pratt, also had
strong claims for post season action. Basically, what it came down to was an
abundance of quality teams in the east. virtually assuring more than one dis-
grantled school.

Actually, the eastern committee was no help to the Danes at all. After a I

long debate. they decided on Pratt for the remaining spot to the Eastern
Regional. It was the national committee, with persuasion by unofﬁcial
eastern chairman Lew Alexander, that found a place for Albany.

This is whcrc the NCAA should be commended. They showed that they’
were ﬂexible, and that they actually had the best interests ofthc tournament.
at heart. Seeing that the cast was crowded, the national committee lookcdi
elsewhere, and finally found a spot opcp in the Southern Regional in Ken-v
tucky.

Where they could have went with a conservative move. instead the com-
mittee took a gamble. By placing Albany in the Southern Regionalahead ofa
southern team. the NCAA must have incurred the anger of a number of
schools in the south. But the committee wanted the best teams possible, even
if it meant sending Albany. NY. to Danvillc, Ky.

Hines Overpower Utioa, 70-65

by Paul Schwartz

Despite all the excitement about
going to Kentucky for the NCAA
playoffs. the Albany State baslret-
ballstili had one more rcgularscason
game to play beforc their trip on
’l‘bursday. It was against Utica
College. and with really nothing at
«take, the Danes dominated the
Pioneers off the boards and went on
to beat Utica,7t)—65.

In improving their record to 19-6,
the Danes used a rebounding
barrage to their advantage in Utiea.
Albany outrebounded the Pioneers

47-20, ttnd Dane centcr Barry
Cavanaugh almost singlcbandcdly
surpassed the Pioneer total.
Cavanaugh hauled down a career-
high l9 rebounds and shared scoring
honors with Carmelo Verdcjo with
19 points. Pete Staniin added eight
rebounds for Albany.

However, in gaining the victory.
the Danes may have lost the services
of one or possibly two of their key
players for the playoffs. With under
three minutes remaining in the game.
Rob (‘lunc came down wrong on his
ankle and 'suffcred a sprain.

Moments later. Bill Bellamy pulled
his Achilles tendon and had to leave
the game. Bellamy is listed as
probable and Clunc is questionable
for Albany's games this weekend in
Kentucky.

The Danes got off to an 8-0 lead
against lltictt and never trailed.
After building a 34»27 advantage,
Albany saw their lead dwindle to
three points on three occasions late
in tile game. A layup by Verdcjoand
two tonl shots npiccc by Stitnish and
Buddy chklinski scaled the game
for the Danes.

Cygnets To Present Annual Show ‘

by Janet E. Cerni

The Cygncts, Albany State's syn—
chronizcd swimming team. will pre-
sent its annual show, entitled “On
'l‘our". this weekend in the Universi-
ty l’ool. Coach l’at Rogers promises
a fine performance. “It‘s the best
they‘ve cvcr looked.“ said Rogers.
"l'm really excited. It's the most in-
teresting and most difficult as well as
the best show I've cvcrsccn put on."

The event‘s “On Tour“ theme is
drawn from the squad‘s selection of
classical and contemporary music
from around the world. “There are a
few pic—conceived audience notions
about the music," said Rogers, "so
it‘s upto the swimmers to portray the
theme through their choreography."

Iiificcn routines, includingti finale
by the entire tcam.will compnsc the
sliow‘s acts. Promised highlights in-
clude four solo routines to be per-

' formed by seniors Lisa Baily, Nancy
Glasso, Sue Goodman, and
freshman Ll'l. White and four duels
including one to be presented by the
team‘s two tnalc members, Tom
Sena and Tony Calsolcro. Two trios,
one quartet, and two team presen-
tations round out the program.

All choreography was done by the
swimmers. with pool pattern .and
audience interest as the top
priorities. "Willi the few who had
had little or no experience in design-
ing a routine,“ Rogers said. “we gave
thctn a start with music and some in-
itial help with the choreography. We
basically told them about patterns.'
stroking, figures. and transitional
movements and then they ptit it all
together.

“ This week we stressed ﬁne points
and synchronization. and I‘m really
pleased with how practice has been

going. This is a really good team and
it‘s been a great year . . . a big and
enthusiastic audience will make the
show even more exciting for the
kids."

Two weeks before rcgiona' com-
petition. Rogers secs this weekend's
show as an aid to her swimmers.
“This is the final event for many of
the novices. however, several of
them might move up (to the junior
level) if we need extra swimmers for
the rcgionals. It will depend on how
they do this weekend and our
strategy.“

This weekend's presentation of
"The Cygncts On Tour" will be per-
formed on Friday and Saturday
cvcningnt 8:15 and on Sunday after-
noon at 32l5 p.m. Admission is $1
for those under sixteen years of age
and tax card holders. $2 for all
others.

Pratt Kicked Out Of Regional

by David Osborn I
Fine print lll legal docu—
ments can ofch reverse a
decision when It's discovered and a
special clause cited by the NCAA
basketball committee Tuesday mor-
‘ning changed the plans of two
eastern Division III teams and gave
the Eastern Regional in Stony Brook
the exact same pairings uslastyear.
Pratt Institute, which had
originally been selected to fill the
fourth spot in the bracket. was
replaced by Manhuttunville (‘ollcgc
after the NCAA discovered an arti-
clc stipulating that a conference
lacking an automatic bid to the tour-
nament can‘t have two teams
entered. Pratt and Stony Brook arc
'jn the Knickerbocker Conference.
A conference like the SUNYAC
with an automatic berth guaranteed
to its champion is permitted to have
two entries but Pratt lost out since
the Knickerbocker has no such

' ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

too few members presently. The
lateness of the discovery forestalled
the possibility of taking Albany
‘statc ottt of the Southern Regional,
bringing them to the cast, and sen-
ding Manhuttanville southward.
“We're just thrilled to be in the
tournament and our kids were eluted
when we told them Tuesday night
because we were already planning to
go to the ECAC's," said Tim
(‘obanc. Manhattauvillc‘s coach.
"But I'd rather go south; the cast is
traditionally one of the nation's
toughest rcgionuls and the competi-
tion down there may he a bit easier."
First round matchups in the
regional at Stony Brook will pair St.
Lawrence with Manhattanvillc and
SUNYAC entry Potsdam with the
hosts. 'l'hosc mutchups read the
same as they did one yucar ago when
St, Lawrence beat Manhattunvilie
(15-62. Stony Brook topped Potsdam
and Stony Brook edged St.
Lawrence in the ﬁnals and eventual-

ly reached the ﬁnal four. Coltane ad-
mitted the precariousness of travel-
ing to meet teams ofunknowa quali-
ty. But. he said. at least it beats going
to Stony Brook to play with three
acknowledged powers.

An earlier rumor saying Pratt was
disqualified because they used on in-
clligiblc player whcnthey beat Stony
Brook last Saturday night was dis-
pelled. “'l‘hat wasjust an idle rumor
and I even spoke with the Stony
Brook Athletic Director and he
agreed." said  Wayne Sundcrland,
Pratt‘s Athletic Director and a
memberofthceastcrnadvisorycom-
mittcc.

Sundcrland explained that the
move had been a clear oversight.
The national committee obviously
tttbbcd Stony Brook due to their out-
standing rcgulur season record
despite the fact that Pratt actually
won the conference by beating the
Pioneers. Plattsburgh was passed
over in favor of Manhattanvillc
