hereon Hike A Little Nearer

continued from page one

Shortly before the committee
took a vote on- the tuition Increase,
fifty students from various SUNY
and CUNY schools broke into a
chorus of "My Country ‘Tls of
Thee" and then left the room.
Upon returning and being informed
of the committee's decision, the
students yelled and chanted, “No
way, We won'tpayl"

Cronin said that the committee
met in New York to avoid a scene
similar to the one that took place in
Albany last Wednesday, when over
120 students packed into the

' "Trustees‘ meeting room at the

SUN Y Plaza to help stall the tuition
talks.

"The committee's decision was
a setback for the students.,"
Cronin commented. "The Board
made a premature decision and
cowardly act in not fighting along
with the students, at least untll the
budget is approved by the
legislature on April 1. "

"it's in the legislature now,"
added Cronin. "it's a tough battle
but/think we can winit."

In a related event yesterday.
Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink
held an impromtu meeting with
SUNY students for over 55
minutes. Fink told the students to
collect petitions to prove they had
strong support, from within their
ranks, against the tuition hike.

Chairman of the Board of Trus-
tees Donald Bllnken said that SUNY
has already cutback to the edge of
what was manageable. “The Board
remains as committed as ever to a
Unlvetslty offering quality
educalon at the lowest possible
cost, " he said.

Blinken added that the Board Is
"convinced that Its action
represents the most reasonable
alternative under very dill/cult cir-
cumstancas. "

SASU President Steve Allinger
said that he was very disappointed
by the .Trustees' decision but
believed that the fight is far from
over. Allinger stressed the impor-
tance of student Involvement, letter
writing, and visiting legislators.
and said that the student campaign
has some legislative support.

Allinger said that attention is now
being directed towards the large
protest which is planned for March
21, when between five and ten
thousand students will march lrom
Lincoln Park to the steps at the
Capitol.

BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) China
announced today It has begun
withdrawing its troops from Viet-
nam. 16 days after they struck
across the border to teach a bloody
mllltary “lesson " to Hanoi. .

Peking's official news agency
said the invasion force was being
pulled out "alter achieving the
goals assigned to them. " But Viet-
nam called the Chinese attack a
failure. it reportedly cost the lives
of thousands on both sides.

Kyodo, the Japanese news ser-
vice. said in a dispatch from Peking
that the government announced all
Chinese troops were being with-
drawn.

The announcement by China's
Xlnhua Hsinhua agency warned,
however, that "the Chinese side
reserves the right to strike back
again in self-defense" ll Vietnam
resumes the border "provocalions

and incursions" that China said ~

forced It to launch lts "sell-
deiense ' ' invasion Feb. 1 7.

The announcement added: “The
Chinese government proposes once
again that the Chinese and Vlet-'
namese sides speedily hold
negotiations to discuss ways of en-
suring peace and tranquility bet-
ween the two countries and then
proceed to settle the boundary and
territorial disputes. "

it also called on the rest at the
world to "take measures to urge
the Vietnamese authorities to stop
promptly their aggression against
Kampuchea Cambodia and with-
draw all thelr forces of invasion. "
