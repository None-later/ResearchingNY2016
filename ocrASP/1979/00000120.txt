Last Friday night, a crowd comprised
mainly at SUN YA students were treated to a
night of great acoustic music by Jorma
Kaukonen. A perlormer could not ask tor a
more dedicated crowd. Some lanai/cs had
waited outside all night in sub zero weather
for an opportunity to hear this man.

Lisa Schwartz

Robert Schwartz

Jorma's prolessional career started over
twelve years ago when he and his high
school buddy Jack Casady joined the now
legendary Jellerson Airplane. Jorma played
with the Airplane tor many years, delining
his art and playing some extremely spaced
leads

In 1969, bored with the Airplane's in-
trequent touring and tired at constant
squabb/es, Jorma and Jack lormed Hot
Tuna. Jorma wished to get back to the music
he truly loves — the blues. Hot Tuna played
as an opening act to the Airplane tor a short
time, but with the total demise oi the Air-
plane (circa 7972), Tuna became a lull-time
endeavor.

Hot Tuna disbanded in 1978, alter the
release oi the live album "Double Dose",
their ninth. Jack returned to San Francisco
to "lick his wounds, " while Jorma decided
to strike out his own. This brings us to Jor-
ma ’5 current solo tour.

Many tans were shocked by his new ap-
pearance. Gone was the familiar, long.
shaggy brown hair and in it 's place was
short, greased-back hair, piled high, and
dyed a bright red. in recent_shows he has
even been known to don a button-down
shirt and a tie!

Jorma's stage presence was sedate,

 

 

 

seat. His only extraneous movements were
occasional hits trom his Heineken, or bottle
at Jose Cuervo Gold.

Jorma's unique style Is an amalgamation
0/ blues riils and phenomenal ragtime
picking, taught to Jorma by his mentor,
Reverend Gary Davis. The core ot this style
revolves around playing a bass line with his
thumb, while his other lingers pick out one
or more lead lines. This technique is accom-
plished with the use at steel linger picks,
which are lrequently associated with
bluegrass players. He also employs an elec-
tronic device on his Ovation guitar which
yields a haunting, slow decay eltect, used
on such songs as "Killing Time in the
Crystal City, " and "Watch the North Wind
Rise." With his picking style and em-
bellished blues chords Jorma spun long,
ethereal jams, sometimes turning three
minute songs into tilteen minute extravagan-
zas.

‘Jorlna opened with an old lavarlte, tram
Hot Tuna 's lirst album, called "Hesitatlon

Blues. " He gave a competent reading at this .

classic blues tune, but it was only a
suggestion at things to come. Jorma takes
about three songs to get warmed up. Towar-
ds the end 0/ "I See the Light, " he began to
really roll, and didn't let up the rest at the
night.

Jorma played tunes lrom all at Hot Tune '5
albums, but relied most heavily on his
acoustic solo album, "Ouah, " and the lirst
Tuna album. Also included in the marathon
lhreehour set were three new songs, (two
written by Jorma, one an old blues tune),
and a song called "l Belong to That Band, "
an old traditional song, which does not ap-

pear on any album. as well as a law old Air-

plane tunes.

    

I 

loved tunes such as “New Song For the

Morning,"and "Water Song."Atone point Iett Page Hall alter three hours of

the screams tor "Genesis, " trom “Ouah. "
became so overwhelming that Jorma con-
ceded and played it, he rarely does.

aorma surprised many people by pulling Burgers, and "Serpent 0’ Dream. " "am
out such old numbers as the Airplane Americas Choice. The concert ended witha
classics, "Embryonic Journey, "and "Trial screaming encore version at "Come Back
