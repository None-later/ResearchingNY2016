An Oregon judge has Issued an
order which permanently bars all
the state's female prison guards
from lrisking the male inmates. .

Judge Richard Barber ruled that
"prisoners should be able to retain
the last bit of personal privacy of
not being observed or patted down
by persons of the opposite six. "

The female guards claim this
decision amounts to sex
discrimination. They contend that
without the right to search and
handle prisoners, they are confirv
med to simple watchtower duly
where promotions to higher jobs
are virtually impossible.

VA SECTOMIES?

A California research institute
has launched a crash study to

health. .

The statistical study is being
condtIc ted by S.R.I. international
In Menlo Park after medical resear-
chers uncovered disturbing
evidence about the adverse effects
of vasectomies on male monkeys.

Researchers at the Oregon
Regional Primate center in Beaver-
ton, Oregon have discovered that
monkeys who have undergone the
male sterilization procedure have
subsequently developed serlous ar-
tery and heart problems.

Doctor Nancy Alexander says
that male monkeys which had been
sterilized and then fed high
cholesterol diets have been
showing alarmingly high levels of
blockage of the arteries. These

are dangerous for human males.
,However, she would recommend
that men who are. considering a
vasectomy should use other birth
control means for the next years,
until the serious questions about
the possible side effects of vasec—
tomies are cleared up.
