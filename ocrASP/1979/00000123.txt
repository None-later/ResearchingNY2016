' 7 es Eliminated In Kentucky '

linued from page 20
The Tiger's sfratgegy was simple '
(use up most of the 1:23 that was
t on the clock, and than try for
- winning shot. Albany countered
th a man-to-man defense, but
- Danes could not take the ball
ay from the Savanah ballhan-
rs. Duickly switching to a zone,
: Danes made sure not to foul.
- Tigers waited for the last shot,
became confused, and Hub-
d was forced to throw up a 35-
t desperation 'shot. It was an
all. and It was also overtime, a
co the Danes had not won this

something around the team wasn 'f
right. It was a letdown or
something. "

The letdown was evident. as
Savannah stormed out with nine
straight points. There was less
than three minutes remaining In the
overtime. and the Danes seemed
ready to pack their bags and limp
back to Albany. ~

Verde/o quickly hit two foul
shots. and Sauers hustled Lee
Gardner info the game Ior more
speed. Cavanaugh hit from under-
neath, and after a Savannah lur-
novor, the Danes called for time,
trailing 76-71 with only 2: 19 to go.

Verde/o scored from close range.
and now down by three, Przybyla
fouled Wilson. The Savannah guard
missed from the line, but the Tigers
stole an errant Albany pass, and
Levi Williams banked home a layup
with 1:36 left for a 78-73 Tiger
load, It seemed the Dane comeback
was over before it really started.

- Then Przybylo took over. Taking

the Initiative on offense, he canned
a long jumper, stole the ball right
out of at Savannah player's hands,
and scored on a fast break layup. I!
was now 78-77, and with 1:13
still left. the Danes unbelievably
were still In the game.

Williams was Immediaton fouled.
with the pressure on. he connected
on two free throws. Albany came
back with two shots at the basket.
but could not put the ball in. The
Tigers had just 41 seconds to kill.
but were unable to nail down the
decision. A traveling call gave the
Danes another chance, and it was
Przybylo again, this time on a long
outside shot.

"We were trying to catch up and
we needed to score quickly, " said
Przybylo. "We needed a spark.
and I thought I could be that
spark. "

The Danes trailed 80-79. and
with 13 seconds left, Gardner was
forced to foul Wilson. The junior hit
less than half his foul shots during
the regular season, but he calmly
put in two shots to give his learn an
82-79 advantage.

Albany called for time, and with
four seconds to go, Cluno scored
from inside. It was 82-81 with two
seconds left. Cavanaugh fouled
Williams, and even though the
clock had run out, Wilson was

awarded a foul shot. It missed, the
rebound bounced out, and the
game was over.

“These last few minutes In over-
time. that's the way we should
have played the whole game. " said
Wlekllnskl. "It was like they ex-
pected us to steal the ball. When
we had our big lead. we were
playing like we knew they were
going to come back. '.'

"In the first half, we just didn’t
came to play, " said Ellington.
"Down the stretch, we played ball.

I would hate to go through a game
like this every night. "

After their crushing defeat, the
Danes still had to face Lane in the
consolation game. "After we lost,
realistically there was nothing left
that we could do about it, " said
Jones. "We wanted to win 20
games this season, because that
hasn't been done around Albany
fora long time. "

"We went into the game looking
for our 20111 win. ” added Wick/in-
ski. “We talked about the Savan-
nah gamo and how we blew it, and
we decided to have fun and/lave a
good time playing (he consolation
game. "

With a great deal of pressure
now gone. the Danes and the Lane
Dragons ' traded baskets for
much of the first half. But with

20 ' points before halftime. the
Dragons opened up a 47-41 advan-
fags.

In the second half. and the last
20 minutes for four seniors an the
Albany squad, the Danes pulled a
reversal from their first round
game. and came back against
Lane. Leading the charge was
Cavanaugh, who played an in-
splred game and topped off his
career with a 19-point. lB rebound
performance. Also performing for
the last time In an Albany uniform
was Verde/o, and he finished with
21 points. and his 45 point perfor-
mance in the regional was enough
to put him on the all-tournament
team. ‘

Albany trailed 73-69 with 4:43
left to play. but Cavanaugh closed
the Dragon lead with a layup. Steve
Low connected from inside to tie
the score at 73. and the game went
Into overtime.

In the extra period. It was
Sfanisli that took control for
Albany. Scoring the Danes first
seven points, Stan/sh gave Albany
a three point advantage, and they
never trailed again.

"It’s nice la win one. said
Sauers. “l was glad We were in-
vited, and I think we proved we
belong. It was a fair test. and l'm
proud of the whole learn. "

It was a banner season for the
Danes. Winning 2D games for only
the second time in their history is a
worthy accomplishment. But
looking at the way Albany lost in
the regional. if things would have
been slightly different. the Danes
might have been winning a few
more than 20 games. Possibly four
more games, and just maybe. a
national championship.
