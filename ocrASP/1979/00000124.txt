Bryant.‘ who 'd been watching the
contest to prepare a scouting report

plain the Dane second-hall demise.
He likened the collapse to the 1977
Division I line! when North Carolina
went Into the tour corners too early,
squandered a lead, and eventually
lost to Marquette.

"When you have the momentum
like that and you take it away lrom
yoursell like Albany did by slowing
It down It Is sometimes hard to get
It back together," Bryant said.
"Strategy can always work both
ways; in North Carolina they were

"Well I'm always looking Ior

' ‘I 'II keep looking. "

For Albany. the toss marked the

Alter the game. I was numb. The

me yet - the next day l linally
realized that Albany was Indeed

The consolation game the next day
was really very little consolation tor

over it, but every now and then I
still lind mysell wondering how the
Danes lost, and trying to llgure out
how tar Albany actually could have

Alter the Danes got-knocked out
In the llrst round, there was no
question about who I would be
rooting tor In the llnals.

On Saturday night, the con-

solation game was llrst and Albany -

won their only overtime contest at
the season. This provided some
personal rallel, but those from
Albany who were there. Including
the Danes, expected better. Other
than that big regret, there was one
more disappointment over the
weekend. Centre was playing In
the llnals and by an Intormal vote,
our bus-load decided to stay ior
only the first hall.

With 1:35 lett In the hall, the
Colonels went Into a perlectly
executed live-man weaving stall
against Savannah. The tans went
wild and I could not hold back my
applause. Finally, Curtis was
touted with 48 seconds lelt, Centre
was ahead 33-16, and the crowd
began to sing their favorite cheer:
“Ain't no way you can beat the
Colonels."

You know what? I think the tans
might be right. The 14-member
squad that warms up in their
modest olive uni/arms and their
white Ill-cons should make It to
Rock island, the site at the Final
Four. For a weekend, they took me
over.
