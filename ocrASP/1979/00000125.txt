something that i could look at as
distinctly culturally different than
what we experience up north.

This seemingly aimless search

walked in, quick/y glanced at the
school records listed on a black-
board, and proceeded to inspect

replacement, but my regrets would

would have wanted to witness it

someone also doing it for me

feelings, 97 FM. And if the Danes
would have lost, / thought i still
would be missing the experience of
seeing a part of the United States
which i never have been to (not
that l have seen so much), and in
addition squander a chance to visit
a small Southern school that has an
enrollment of only 800 students.
Variety is the spice of life, they say.
As the weekend turned out, oirr
Danes unfortunately did lose, but

someone tapped me on the
shoulder. I turned around and a
distinguished-looking elderly man
told me a Presbyterian baptism was
about to be held there. in the pool,
I thought to myself“ that 's enough
cultural difference for me. I abrup-
tlyleft.

There were a few other such
nuances but none could overwhelm
the sense of loss I felt when the
Danes were defeated in that

ball team. After dropping off our
luggage in the basement of a
fraternity house where all the
Albany guys were staying over-
night, i wont With an ASP
associate to the admissions
building — no, I didn’t decide to
transfer yet — where we learned
we could pick rip the school paper
in the mail room. Actually, we
found one in the garbage pail.

Seeing three articles on the
NCAA tournament obvious/y made
us excited and we headed to the
place where by late Saturday night
I felt I could have called home,
Alumni Gymnasium, the court of
the Centre Colonels basketball
squad and where a great deal of my
time was spent.

Anticipation, Then Frustration

deflating game 'with SaVannah
State. Albany had virtually toyed
with the surprised Tigers In the
opening half and their performance
was a piece of mastery — so much
a pleasure to view I grunted when
the hall rangut. ‘
AI halftime my thoughts were
already turning to Centre in the
final. We 'd beat them, i fell. Our
styles were similar but we seemed
a tad stronger and they could never
handle our two post men, Barry
Cavanaugh and Carmelo Verde/o.
After that, it would be on to Univer-
sity Gym for a quarterfinal. Tire
Danes lose at home, preposterous,
absurd, so I already had Albany

Speaking to Scott Criggs for
about i5 minutcs made me tool at

who ‘liko Griggs ware amiable
throughout the weekend, In his
polite, soft-spoken manner, Criggs
talked to us about the tournament,
the Centre crowd and anything else
we asked about. Then we just hung
around the gym and watched some
students shoot until we met up with
another starter on Centre ‘5 team.

Walking around the gym, we saw - 1

two people at the top of the
bleachers where the announcer
and a radio station would be
situated at game-time. One was a
skinny rrran with a tread full of dark
hair. I presumed he was Centre's

But then that second half, on that
awful second half. -Ei/erythfng went
wrong. Each move coach Dick
Sauers made in the first half had
worked as if prescribed by some
saint-like blueprint. But In the
second half the Danes saw a 13
point lead evaporate and nothing
worked. Albany lacked discipline;
Savannah picked up their game
and everything was going to
pieces.

Then those emotional memories
following the loss. Ray Cesare and
Bill Bellamy sitting glued to those
green seats constituting the bench.
Bellamy looked directly forward, at
the foul line, perhaps he was lost in
a ~blank stars and his own
thoughts; obviously contemplating
the loss.

Cesare had his tread bent down.
He looked on the verge of tears and
wire could blame him. i didn't

speak to anyone myself for a IIttI
while since i was trying to recollec
how we‘d actually lost. Finally

caraused on over to Tom Bryant,
the Centre coach, and Russel
Ellington, the. Savannah coach, to
record their thoughts on the game.

At practice on Saturday, the
Danes all embraced around Sauers
for the last time when the practice
had been concluded. That night,
Sauers appeared to be almost move

newness of the site made It even
more enticing. Until the 17-hour
bus ride back, it had still at

disappointing results.

After The Danes Had Lost,
The Depression Set In

Moments after the Danes had
lost to Savannah State, l stood ricer
the press tab/o in disbelief. Only
one hour car/for, / was on top of the
world. Now i fell like jumping off.

eroii i first hoard that Albany
was selected to play in the
Southern Regional, my first
thought was, "Will it be easier to
win tho/o?" You soc, (really didn't

two wins. I had big things iir mind
for the Albany State basketball
team.

Ain’t No Way You Can Beat The Colonels

Adjacent to us, on a smaller sot
of bleachers sat down someone
who we soon found out was Neil
Siorbo. He doesn't look like a
basketball player, so he must be
one, / thought. i tfidn ’l strike out.

Sterba, who talked witlr a slight
lisp, said he felt a little tight about
the NCAA tournament because it
was his first one. He could have
fooled me, as ho was keeping one
eye on us and the other on the
Albany cheerleaders who were
practicing their routines at mid-
court. One can detect a slight trace
of flak/noes in Starba. but when
he ‘s on the basketball court, it 's all
business. The same is true for the
