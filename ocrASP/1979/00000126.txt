(Injured “Clune Contributes

by David Osborn

DANVILLE, KY. .Durlng halftime of
the Centre-Lane matchup In the
opening game of the NCAA Division
III Southern Regional Friday night.
Rob Clune and several Albany State
teamates were feasting on an
elaborate buffet-style spread in a
hospitality room designed for com-
peting squads and the press. Clune
led the charge on the edibles and
drinks.

It was still an hour before the
Danes would square off with
Savannah State and the players
were dressed in formal attire.
Clune wore a suit like most and he
was favoring the left ankle he'd in-
jured last week just a little. His
assistance in the Albany effort
seemed to be a key factor in any
potential Dane success.

“Hey Bob, how‘s the ankle
feeling, "he was asked.

“Alright.” he replied. in bet-
ween sips of a soft drink. "i think
i'm gonna be able to play. " A little
later, Clune descended into the
locker room to put on his purple
Dane uniform and awaited a sell-
evaluation of sorts after warmups
to determine his status.

He (coach Dick Sauers) told
me to go lull out in the warmups
and then tell him how I felt and
he'd take it from there," Clune
said after the Danes had won the
consolation game on Saturday. "It
felt alright but not great and I'd say
i was playing at about 75 percent. l
lust told him how I felt and I wasnt
sure If he was gonna use me,

honest/v." ~

,Clune's ankle had been a,
ma/or concern of Sauers’ ever sln~
ce his sophomore guard received
the inlury In the win over Utica last
Tuesday. To the surprise of
everyone except Sauers himself.
Clune Was inserted for Bud-
dleeklinski with 13:191eft In the,
first half of the Savannah game.
From there. although he hobbled
on occasion, Sauers used him
sparingly and Cfune chipped In
with an unexpected 14 points for
the weekend: not far from his nor-
mal 8. 3 game point average.

"When we came down here i
really didn't think Rob was gonna
be able to play." said Sauers.
“He’s a helluva kid. He played as
good as I could have expected
considering his condition. Once he
got out there he played that same
pressing defense he plays when
he ‘s perfectly healthy. " ‘

Anytime Clune went Into the
game he nearly hopped on his right
foot while trotting onto the court.
But once the action began he
seemed to forget about the hen-
dicap and he competed at a full tilt.
He said the intensity of the com-
petition made him forget the In/ury.

' After both games, however, he

confessed that it hurt somewhat.
Although Ctune refrained from
shooting, he only attempted nine
shots for the tourney, he did take
charge of the Dane offense quickly
alter entering the game against
Savannah. He directedthe patient
attack and contributed three free
throws as the one-point Dane lead

when he entered ballooned to eight
before he was glv en a rest.

With 14:35 left against Savan-
nah. Clune re-entered. He ap-
peared to grlmace once when he'
was forced to keep pace with Levi
Williams, the Tigers' speedy
guard. The persistence overcame
the element of pain though. and
Clune remained and even connec-
ted on a 20-foot jumper to give
Albany a 56-47 lead with 11:35 to
play. He stayed In for another four
minutes. During the overtime
,session, Sauers opted to keep
Clune on the bench.

Clune, 6'2" with short, sandy
hair, was selected to last year's
ECAC post-season all-tournament
team. He didn't play often enough
to receive a similar honor this year
down south, but he achieved a per-
sonal goal set enroute to Kentucky
by offering a contribution. In the
consolation game Clune again came
off the bench and hit for six points
in the first half. He played hard
enough to foul out of the contest.

"Bob's ln/ury was a day-to-day
situation and it was getting
progressively better each day since
the Utica game, " said Jack
Koelmel. the Albany trainer.

And while he was in, Cfune dove,
scrambled and lunged for the ball
on defense without any signs of
hinderance. He even garnered four
steals for his limited duty. His play

1 exhibited a feverishness more im-
pressive in its tenacity than actual
quality. 'He sure was
courageous, " said Sauers.

"Regional Notebook Fi-om Danvilie, Kentch '

 

‘ by David Osborn
DANVILLE, KY. Despite Albany
State's failure to advance beyond

' the NCAA Division lll Southern

Regional held here this weekend,
the trip we small southern town
was an experience for the squad
and the sizable contingent of al-
filiated groups that made the [our-
ney. Here are some of the
highlights picked from the har-
dwood and Immediate surroun-

' dings.

Southern Hospitality was exten-
ded to the Danes in many ways and
their loss In the semis ruined what
could have been a perfectly delight-

formal banquet Thursday night for
all four teams and Bob Clune said
the food was great and Buddy
Wlek/inskl said he enjoyed meeting
the other squads off the court.

A large sign painted in a deep
blue proclaims, "This is Lexington
Kentucky, home of the Kentucy
Wildcats, "at the Lexington Airport
where the Danes’ plane landed late
Thursday afternoon. it proved only
the beginning of an unintentional
display in the city thirty miles from
Danvllle that left no doubt of its
claim as the mid-south sports cen-
ter.

Basketball in particular pervades
the whole city and coupled with the
constant reminder that Lexington is
the home of the Kentucky Derby,
the essence of the town escapes
none. In a McDonalds, a University
of Kentucky recruiter dressed in a
grey three-piece suit was busily
convincing a high school recruit
from Michigan why he should play
in Lexington.

Their talk was pure basketball.
The candidate was thrusted a copy
of that morning's Lexington Herald
and coaxed about the fine press
coverage he'd receive at Kentucky.
The paper had three stories on
Kentucky's win over Alabama t'n an
SEC quarterfinal game the previous
night. High school basketball and
even girls’ basketball occupied
largo. chunks of the sports section.
- Tito recruiter spoke of Hupp
Arena, Kentucky's frame, with a
capacity of over 20,000. In a shop-

they call it. In a stationary store, an
almost saint-like picture of Adolph

"Everybody was overly nice to
us and the NCAA 's is always a
great experience," said Wleklin-

Danes made the playoffs.

by Rich Seligson

DANVILLE, KY. In Friday '3 edition
of The Cento, Centre College's
student newspaper, a front-page
news article on the NCAA Southern

Regional basketball tournament
contained the following
paragraph."

"Tonight '5 second game pits the
State University of New York at
Albany, known as Albany State,
against Savannah State — the
SIAC champions. Tltc Great Danes
should have a rather large cheering
section if lust half of Albany's
13,330 students travel to the
game."

Sar‘casntasidc — Centre '5 home
court cart only seat 1400 ~ due to
the strong backing of the 15—
rncmber Great Dane Pep hand, 10
cheerleaders and a handful of loyal
fans, Alumni Gymnasium quickly
became traitsftnrnrttt into a

 

southern version of Albany's

with their treatment.

Savannah State, the Danes'
semifinal conqueror. stayed in the
same hotel. All the hospitality and
fine treatment was appreciated.
But Steve Sauers, Doc’s 11-year-
old son whatnade the trip, perhaps
phrased- lt best when he said

nothing really seemed to matter‘

anymore once the Danes lost.
Defeat can taint anything.
tﬁﬁtﬁﬂﬂﬁt.

The Albany Pep Band and
cheerleaders may have made the
biggest Impression on the hosts.
Centre coach Tom Bryant jokingly
offered to buy the Pep Band for his
future contests and when informed
they could be bought, he laughed
and asked, "for how much?"
Through draw/s ranging in inten-
city from soft to the point of being
impossible to discern, all four-
nament officials praised the Albany
rooters for their spirited par-
ticipation.

"We were impressed by the
small-town southern hospitality
and it seemed that both partners
got along very well," said Mark
Kendrat, a Pep Band member, one
of 15 to make the trip. "in the first
game we were concerned about the
NCAA rule not allowing us to play
during the game, but we relaxed
for the second game. "

The Danes were the only squad
backed by a band, Peggy Frisbee,
the Centre Sports- Information
Director, said the band was an
unexpected treat and combined
with the cheerleaders, 10 of them,
Albany added more zest to the
regional than any group except the
boisterous Centre fans. "Can you
leave us the Pep Band when you
go, " Bryant quipped. '

Two notable Albany achievemen-
ts emerged lrom the otherwise
somber results in Danville. Carmelo
Verde/o scored 45 points and
raised his final career total to 1035
which is good for eighth place on

University Gym when the Danes
took the floor for their opening-
round contest.

"We came down here to do
something, " said devoted Albany
fan Jerry Wolansky. "We gotta go
nuts. "

"That sbpport is great," felt
Centre College starting guard Scott
Griggs. "l was glad to see that. It
says a lot for your school. "

But even before the shouting and
reusing music, Albany State made
an impression on the Soul/tern
folks from the start when the Pep
Band played the National Anthem to
kick off the tournament. The otte-
student Centre band, consisting of
a lone drummer, was gratified.
“it's good to have someone play
the Star Spangled Banner," he
said. "We used to have to play a
record for that. "

Did the drummer ever hear of
Albany? "I‘ve heard of Albany, but

the all-time school list. Verde/o also
completed the season as the
leading Dane scorer; wrestling that
honor from Barry Cavanaugh who

had held it for three years.

The victory over Lane College in
the consolation game enabled the
Danes to complete the season with
a 20-7 mark. For Sauers, it was
only the second time a squad of his
at Albany had reached the 20-
victor lateau. In 1960-61 the

not the school," he answered. "I
guess they never heard of Centre
either."

After the National Anthem, one
section of Centre students
remained standing, and stayed that
way for the rest of their scltoof's
first-round matchup against Lane
College of Tennessee. These were
the most avid of fans, who cheered
every one of their leant's baskets
and argued with every questionable
referee's call, Soul/tern drawl and
all.

At halftime, one of the spec»
tators' attention was switched to a
school many miles away in the nor-
th.’

"A bunch of people are peed off
that Transy (Transylvania, a
soul/torn scltool) didn’t make the

high school student. “They

for the group of Albany people not

recognizable facet of the school to a

unlocked. ~
