by Paul Schwartz
DANVILLE, Ky. — At aaittime
Friday night, there was really very
little to worry about. Not only were
the Danes winning, but they had
taken their advantage with ap-
parent ease. The Albany squad ran
triumphantly oil the court. secure
with a nine-point lead. and lull ot
brewing confidence. Clearly.
things couldn't have been much
better.

But it got even better. Playing
superb basketball, the Danes
soared ahead by 13 points, and
were well on their way to a Victory
over ,Savannah_State in the llrst
round of the NCAA Division II/
Southern Regional. For Albany,
spirits Were as high as the llight

.Jhat brought them to Kentucky.

The Danes came back down to
earth with a crash landing.

The story Is not a new one.
Albany had the game in their han-
ds, and then slowly but surely gave
it away. Savannah readily accepted
the gill. and tough! back to tie the
contest. Albany’s and came in
overtime. A lurious comeback tell
short, and the Danes lost, 82-81.

' Elimination was now a reality. The
title hopes were gone, put to rest in
a near-empty gym many miles item
the Danes ' home.

"We should have beaten them, "
said Kelvin Jones. "Ask anybody
on our team, and they'll say we
should have beated them. That's
why it 's so sad that it happened. "

Albany reg/duped to take third
place in the regional by defeating

next night. Then'the Danes put
back on their suits'and watched
trom the stands as the host school.
Centre College, overwhelmed
Savannah 82-54 to win the
Southern Regional. Centre Wilt go
against the champion ot the Great
Lakes Regional this weekend in
nanvl

Disappointed Albany coach Dick
Sauers heads towards bench.

In the opening game at the tour-
nament, Centre _ relied on a
disciplined passing attack to deleat
a physically superior Lane squad,
79-68. White Lane nullilted their
substantial height advantage with a
ridiculous shot selection, Centre
cooly and calrny worked on ottense
until they got the shot they wanted.
It was a classic controntation bet-
ween uncoached raw talent and
steady, moderately-gifted perfor-
mars.

The Albany-Savannah matchup
seemed to shape up into a strnitar
situation, and trom the outset, the
results appeared to tot/ow the same

pattern. The Danes came at the

Tigers with everyone at their otten—'
sive weapons, and each proved et-
lective against a loss-than-
learsorne Savannah delense. Bill
Bellamy ttit on a lurnper tor
Albany's lnltlal southern points,
Buddy Wteklinski tot/owed with two
long set shots, and the Danes were
all and running.

Every move that Albany coach
Dick Sauers made in the llrst halt
worked to pertectton. Pete Stanish
was sent in the bat/game with only
eight minutes gone, and he lm-
mediater drove tor a three-point

'piay. Jones contributed six points

all the bench. and Dave Przybylo
added tour. By haitttme, the Albany
reserves had outscored Savannahs
20-4, and with Wteklinski 's 20-toot
shot at the buzzer, the Danes had
rolled to a 40-31 lead.

"We had them on the run in the
lirst halt, " said Sauers. "We had
them doing everything we wanted
them to do. We got them to spread
out, and we were getting a lot oi
easy shots down the middle. The
scouting report we had was very
accurate, except that they didn‘t
run as much as we were led to
believe they would. That could be
because we didn't give them the
opportunity to run. " _

“At hat/time, Doc told us that
we had one more trail to play, "
said Stanish. “We were all
psyched. He told us to keep run-
ning our ottense and keep playing
the way we were. "

“We didn’t need the strategy at
hatttime," added Sauers. "They
were the learn that needed
strategy."

Albany came right back at the
Tigers when the second halt
began. Barry Cavanaugh scored on
a tell-handed hook sirot, Bellamy
banked home a iastbreak layltp,
giving the Danes a 46-35 advan-
tage, and then Carmelo Verde/o
began to treat up. Albany's leading
scorer swislted a 20-ioot jumpshot
and hit on a drive to boost the lead
to 50-37 with 14:47 remaining.
The margtrr would go no higher,
but it would shrink — rapidly.

With the 13-point bulge. the
Danes altered their otlensive
thinking. Instead ol trying to pour
on more points, they would slow
down the tempo and look only tor
high percenta e shots. In the
Albany playboe , this cautious plan
is known as the triangle-and-two-
stall, and that was what the Danes

   
  

Danes eave Soth Dow Ad 0t

would go with against Savannah.

"I called tor the triangle in the
second halt, but not exclusively, "
explained Sauers. "We wanted to
mix it up on ottense. Some games it
works, but against Savannah it
didn ’t seem to tunclion right. "

The Danes still had a comtortable r

10 point lead. 57-47, wltlr 11:10
remaining. Savannah's 6 '8" cen—
ter Joey Waller then converted a
three-point play. and Charles Han-
som tot/owed with a jumper. Sud-
denly, the Tigers were within six
points, with 10:30 tell, and the
taller and higher-leaping Savannah
club was beginning to assert them-
selves around the basket.

“We tacked- discipline and let
up, " said‘ Sauers. "We weren't
really mentally con/ident. A few
times someone would try to on
something all by themselves.
Everyone contributed to the second
hall collapse. “

The collapse continued with a
steady pace. Harold Hubbard’s

to go.

When we were up by 13, we
were doing what we wanted, " said
Wteklinski. "But then the same

stutt that we did in Plattsburgh
happened again. i lust don 't know
how it turned. "

"it was Weird, " explained
Stanish. "We were up by 13 poin-
ts, and then they hit three or tour
quick troops. i think they stunned
us by what they were doing. "'

The Danes appeared shaken.
especially when they went to the
loot line. Slx times in the ﬁnal 5:54
an Albany player was sent to take
tree throws, and out at a possible
11 points, the Danes could manage
only three. Jones missed the tront
end 0/ a one-and-one to start the
bail bouncing. Alter Hubbard was
called tor a technical lout tor grab-
bing the rim on his second jam.
Wteklinski was oil on the gitt'iree
throw. With the Danes in Iron! 66-
63 with 4:00 remaining, Bellamy
missed a tout shot. The display all
tree throw shooting was reminicent
of the Danes loss in Oneonta earlier
in the season. That lessen seemed
to be lorgolten in Kentucky.

Hubbard scored on a spinning
drive to bring Savannah willrin orre.
66-65, with 3:39 to play. Verde/o
then missed on a spinningattempt,
but the Danes controlled the
rebound and held the ball until they
got what they wanted. There was
'2:06 remaining, and Savannah '5
Charles Wilson touted Cavanarrgh.

The Dane center missed his tree
throw. and Savannah coach
Russell Ellington called tor a
timeout. The Tigers had now suc-
cessluily taken control 0/ the game.

it took the Tigers all 01 12 secon-
ds to take their llrst lead in over 37
minutes. Hubbard ‘s tip-in gave
Savannah a 67-66 advantage, and
Albany immediater signalled tor a
time out. Alter the one minute
planning sessions. Hob Clone
brought the ball upcourt, and then
lound Verde/o inside, who was
touted. There was 1:31 tell when
Verde/"o went to the line and con-
nected on one 0/ two tree throws. It
was new 67-67, but Savannah
would get another crack at seating
their chances at victory. _
