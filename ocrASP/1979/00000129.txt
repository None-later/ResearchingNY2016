them up i didn‘t like seeing my work
destroyed. And as a resident of the
dorms i don‘t like being inconven—
ienced by false alarms."

The attitude ofcertain people also
bothered Murphy. “Those who pull
false alarms are certainly a very
inconsiderate type." he said. “They
can‘t be very caring about other
people."

However. Murphy does not be—
lieve in setting an example by
severely punishing an offender such
as Clune or Candido. “i am not

person pulling the alarm.“ said

pull it anyway.“

The kind of person who normally
pulls a false alarm can't really be
classiﬁed as a criminal according to
Hayner. "We're realistic about it. we
realize that people get a few beers in
them and decided to have a little

Both Hayner and Murphy said
that another problem with false
alarms is the possible injury to
someone evacuating a tower or
dorm.

“i really don‘t utiderstatid why
people do it." said Murphy. "Evi-
dently they just don't understand
