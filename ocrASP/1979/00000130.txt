REST AT BEST

If you want to take along rest. and be paid for
it. this might be your big chance.

The Federal Government says-it needs more
volunteers for its “bed rest program.“a project
being conducted at the Ames Research Center in
California. '

Volunteers will be served breakfast. lunch and
dinner in bed. and will get to sack out in
“comfortable surroundings." according to the
people at Ames. The only requirement is that
they stay in bed, sometimes for more than half-
u-month at a time.

The Government says that its “bed rest
program" is part of its space research being done
to ﬁndout how lying prone for long periods of
time might affect astronauts.

BOOK WORMS

The bookworms of today may he the
tubeworms of tomorrow. if oite computer
company‘s predictions come true.

The Mitre Corporation of McLean. Virginia.
reports that much of the material in the libraries
of the next century may be computeri/cd.

According to the company. holographic
filings. computeriyed browsing and home

zatac acres

computer printouts of desired books may
eliminate book circulation as we know it.

The Mitre Corporation says that in the face of
future library computer technology. the work
"bookish" might just have to give way. instead
to “tubeish.”

TOXIC TASKS

The Environmental Protection Agency says it
is currently categorizing more than 65.000 toxic
and hazardous chemicals.

EPA Assistant Administrator Steven Jellinek
says the massive inventory of harmful
substances was required by the Toxic
Substances Control Act of I976. it is expected
to be released in April. and according to the
EPA Administrator. will be the first time in
history that a government anywhere knows so
tuuch about what. where and by whom potential
environmental poisons are being produced.

Jellinck says that when the inventory is

released in April. the “two-year honeymoon”
between industry and regulators will end.

Currently more than Sl00 billion isticd up in the
chemical industry in the US.

IT’S NOTA GAS!

The next endangered species may be the gas
station.

The number of US service stations which
derive more than 50% oftheir revenue from us
and oil has plunged from 226.000 in I972. to
l7l.000 in I978 —- a drop of 32%.

A report by the Arthur Little Research Firm
indicates that the service station vanishing act is
expected to continue. Little predicts that there
could be as few as l25.000 stations by |98l. to
serve an 18 to 20 percent itierease in the number
of pe \pit‘ who own cars.

So it you‘ve been having trouble finding gas
stations lately. just wttit another two years.

SLEEP LEAP '

If you ever have trouble sleeping. you might
mull this over during your tossing and turning.

Captain Beefheart claims that he “never”
sleeps. That‘s right. "never." According to the
Captain. even a few hours ofshut-e‘ye is “a waste
of time."

Beeiheart says that he has “broken the sleep
barrier." he claims that he “stayed up for a year
and a half once." ' '

Beefheart also reports that he's completely
turned off by the “laid back"attitude that many

‘ people try to achieve these days. Says the

Captain: “i ain‘t laying back. Gravity is bad
enough. That‘s hard enough to deal with. And
these earth shoes. man. that makes it worse.
Who wants to always walk uphill anyway?"

BABY TAer

Small children. long before they learn to talk.
reportedly communicate with each other
through the use of a “silent language."

London researcher David Lewis says that
video-tripe recordings of babies interacting with
one another reveal that most babies possess very
complex non-verbal signals to communicate
with other infants. Lewis describes the non-
verbal communication as a “secret language."

Lewis claims that infants use facial

conversations to realise that. while they may be
tongue-tied where words are concerned. they are
by no means dumb."
