. Michael

H MellowTigor

Michael who? Although his songs
rarely hit the top of thecharts, Michael
Franks' music is some of the most
intensely mellow music you can get you‘r
hands on. His most recent effort, Tigerin
the Rain, combines some of the best
elements of modern jazz with the more
simple elements of popular music. Aided
by some of the more prominent-jazz
musicians of today, the album, even
during its most complex moments, does
not require an extremely careful
listening. It simply sounds like good
music when taken as a whole.

Hy Stadldll

 

Some of the easy-listening tunes on the
album include “Sanpaku”, “Underneath
the Apple Tree", and “When It's Over“,
The last song on the album,“Lifeline"has

who immediately bring back pleasant
memories of the preelectronic string
ensemble days.

“Tiger in the Rain" survives the hazard
of getting boring due to some excellent
Michael Franks vocals and very well
produced instrumentals. “Living on the
inside“ gets some solid support from
bassist Ron Carter and Mike Mainieri
who plays a fine Vibraphone solo. On top
of that Franks sings the melody in a style
that is characteristic only of himself. He
attacks the notes in his reluctant.-
sounding way and immediately backs off,
almost before the note is even sung. Using

'Franks' new album “Tlger in the Raln" In good mualc In the some man~
nor as his prevlous eltorts -— mellow jazz played by talented muslclans.
‘ l

The following three pogo: have been crootod
ontlrolu by on. Individual, who is not 0 portol'
tho Bloom) swoon! Pros:

Franks :

this approach he seems to caress the
entire melody with his voice, a technique
of his that can make almost any melody
sound good.

"Hideaway" is one of the better jazzy
tunes on the record: The instrumentals
are perfectly coordinated sections which
could pass on any jazz program. When
Franks sings, the instrumentalists fade
down to the background and the song is
bridged more into the pop world.

The most outgoing song on the album
is “Satisfaction Guaranteed" which is a
little weak compositionally. but the fine
musicianship, including solos by alto
saxophonist David Sanborn makes up
for this. The album suffers a bit from
mediocre sounding melodies throughout.
Melodies like “Popsicle Toes." l-raiiks‘
most popular, aren‘t found on this
album. The ly‘rics that Franks has written
for “Tiger in the -Rain" are sometimes
amusing and other times are
philosophically suggestive of life's ways
and means.

The personnel on "Tiger in the Rain"
varies from song to songand provides for
some good diversity in sound. The only
real bad point about the album is that it is
nothing different from his three previous
works which are better than this one. if
you like Michael Franks then you are
bound to like this album. if you don‘t
know Michael Franks you would
probably be better off starting out with
another one of his albums. Either way
Tiger in the Rain is fine relaxing music
for tho times when it is needed.
