I'm-sick and tired of having to put up with
smokers in the cafeteria. I don't want
smoke in my food, and NO BHOKING signs
should be prominently displayed and a strict
policy enforced...of that horrible rust
“doulpture” in the otherwise beautiful East
Garden. It is an eye sore and should be re—
moved...of guest speakers like Muhammad Ali,

for saying nothing of significance, and of

Composed by the Side of Grasmere Lake
by William Wordsworth

Clouds, lingering yet,-extend in solid bars
Through the gray west; and lo: these waters,
By breezeless air to smoothest polish, yield
A vivid repetition of the stars;

Jove, Venus, and the ruddy crest of Mars
Amid his fellows beauteously revealed

At happy distance from earth's groaning field,
Jhere ruthless mortals wage incessant wars.

Is it a mirror?— or the nether Sphere

Opening to view the abyss in which she feeds

Her own calm fires?— But list! a voice is near;
Great Pan himself low—whispering through the reeds,
“Be thankful, thou; for, if unholy deeds

Ravage the world, tranquillity is here!"

Robert DeNiro is subdued and intelligent, making his occa—
sional burst of passion (when he puts a gun to his head
with demonic laughter, or clutches his dead friend in ang—
uish) all the imre striking. But it is Meryl Streep, as '
the lovely, confused young woman who remains home and
knits sweaters for her fiance, who walks off with the act—
ing honors. hiss Streep conveys subtleties of emotion in

a touching and endearing performance.
