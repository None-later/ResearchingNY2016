Safe and Secure
In The Tunnels

It‘s another typical winter day in
Albany and your preparations for battl-

'ing the merciless cold are almost corn-

plete. The radio goes off. the layers of
clothing go on. and you reluctantly hoof—
out into the biting. blustery elements.
generously applying Cliapstik to ttitit
lips. For the downtown dwellers of
SUNYA there is an added horror to
Albany‘s winter frostbite-land. as liun-
dreds of swaddled scholars breathing
white clouds jockey for position at mid-
town curbs. only to watch seventeen
crammed buses roll by.

l'ittt fret not riiy frosty colleagues
l‘licre is a safe refuge iii the riiitlst ol these
unrelenting displeasurcs of “inter made
possible by the architectural genius of
that symmetrical “lltll‘d. lidward l)ure|l
Stone. Ilcncath the glaciated concrete of
the potliittii lics SUNY/\‘s answer to the
ancient cataeoriibs: 'I Hi". 'I’liNNl"l.S.

Once inside these protective passage-
ways. yott learn that theya re provided
with a steady supply of fotil, stagnant air
which becomes increasingly offensive
ltiter on iii the day as the track learii trots
tilting a sweat-stained trail. Needless to
say. the sights encountered in the tunnels
are unique. In fact. they act as a guide to
the arrangement of btrildings on the
podium.

The inorganic stench of chemicals
chokes your lungs as you pass the base-
nietit of the chemistry btiildirig rind tells
you that the men walking in and out of
the doorway iii stained lab coats are not
baking crepes upstairs. Proceeding
around the corner one sees a spacious.
netted enclosure surrounding a large
deptisit of dirt. where several biology
professors cati be seen sitting down with
their lunches. or just playfully chatting
with the microorgatiistiis. Near the
campus center. the deafening ring ofcasli
registers in the “HllNY—l‘iollett Ripoff"
drowns ottt the class of bou lirig balls and
pins. Airy prisserby can preview the
aroma of l’.\S food as they tile by the
pungent garbagc masher.

vicious deparlrriciit oi the trtiiicrsity No!
It is not the Registrar. l'hc tcrrotr.itig
group I speak ol is the brutal mainten-
ance stall. who make walking through
the tunnels as challenging as Rollerliall.
It is safer to III” a gatiiillct ill the
Aborigines than to expose oneself to
these perilous lllltlcl'gl’tllllltl \\'tllk\\tl_\‘s.
Of course with the weather being inclem—
ent. most choose to use the tunnels atitl
pt‘csct‘w their health. which is the tiitist

ironic.
Despite the large numbers of people
using the tunnels. the triaiiitcriancc crcu

continues to speed along oti tlieirclectric~

Most of these cynical little tlciils criioy

game. iii which the driver tactfully pur—
sues his prey foi ati undetermined length
of time. Just as the steering wheel is about
to interrupt the rhythm til your buttocks.
he loudly sounds his lIo/o-tlie-Clown

victitn. It is also a common oecurence to
walk out of the ‘rcd level‘ and into the
service tunnel and come about the width
of a mustache-hair away from being
obliterated by an orange rover and sent to
that big service tunnel iii the sky.

I experienced a close encounter of the
maintenance kind. As I recreate the
scene. some readers may remember being
an eye-witness to this event.

It was just after my finals ended and I
had customarily spent the night iii the
worm with some good friends. After
watching the sunrise at the South Mall
aritl munching otit on a McDonald‘s
breakfast. I decided it would be smart to
go trptou II and return books to the book-
store iti exchange for some desperate
bricks. Wearing a tee«s|iirt. shorts. and
sandals. l ar‘t'i\ctl in the ttlnticl treat the
bookstore at 9 run. carrying a large bo\
of texts. Already. the litie was to the
chemistry building. 'I he tunnels were hot
enough to liake bread in.

Sitting down next to countless boolv
rettirners. I noticed there was a mass
transport of supplies frorii Social Sci-
cticcs to the Biology Building. Scores of
(‘usltriian cars rolletl by iti two-nay tral-
fic. most liitelietl to trailers stacked with
hoses attached to them. I'lie crowd
remained in single file as close to lllL' wall
as possible in fear of being run t)\ er by the
"funnel lirigade.’ who seemed to ignore
our presence. I kept tcllingtlie younglatly
next to rim that someone is going to get
clipped by these gtrys because they were
passing a little too close for comfort.

By 10:30. I was nearing the cotuitct
where books you purchased for setcrity-
live dollars plus your first-born male cart
be exchanged fora (‘l)'|'A bus token and
.i free lIl-lllL'l'. I‘atiguctl lrotii the prc\iotis

Waking suddenly. I felt a trcrricutlotts
