had a tough time getting up mentally

Soph Howie Nuisinov com-
mented on the team's performance.
“We have a hard time playing teams
we know we can beat."be said. “You
try and force the play but sometimes
you can‘t do it."

Earl was pleased with his team's
play‘ considering the extended
layoff. He noted 5’4" playmalter
Harrington as the one who "comes
off the bench and ignites the squad."

Gary Becker had a very
impressive hitting night. Kirk
Andrews hustled well and did a good
job on’the back line. '

“The comeback win will help our
confidence against Cornell on
Saturday. That will be a pretty
tough match.“ said Earl.

Last Wednesday, the Spikers had
an opportunity to compete against
one of the east's top clubs when they
hosted West Point. Albanycame out
on the lasing end by scoresof 1540'.

15-7. i5-l3, but Earl believes the
chance to compete against the Army
squad was another step for his team.
' "The difference is no longer
physical." commented Earl. “it is
now a question of the mental aspect,
we must have confidence and believe
in ourselves.“

. Earl thought his squad played
“very well" but suffered mental
at critical moments. An example is
in the third game against West Point
they fought back from an li-2
deficit only to miss some crucial
serves at the end and lost 15-13.

“We need just a little more work

A somewhat sparse yet select and
enthusiastic audience had the good
fortune to be entenained by the
Albany State synchronized swim

university community. however. did
not capitalize on this opportunity to

audience. Nancy Glasow. Kathy
Lotito. and Mandy Maney achieved
a fine interpretation of the music
which they chose to accompany
their ﬁgures to “Russian Dance."

After intermission, which
included a one and three meter
diving exhibition by women‘s
swimminganddivingteammembers
Charlene Griswold and Joan
Miekelhan. Lisa Bailey and Liz
White captured the audience's
attention with a bright. energetic.
and well timed rendition of“At the
French Follies."

The crowd‘s sentimental
favorites. however. were the team‘s
two male members. Tony Calsolero
and Tom Sena. who. bedcckcd in
green. did a jig off of the diving
board to begin their work"0ur Men
in lrcland."

Solos were placed strategically
throughout the program. Beginning
the evening was Goodman‘s
"Flight". one of the few
choreographed works which was
done to contemporary classical
music. White was interestingly
accompanied by her music in
“Holiday in Hungary." as was
Glasow in "A Glimpse of German.“
which unfortunately was not fully
appreciated by those in attendance
who were in the process of returning
from intermission. i'iighlighting thc
solos was Bailey's exceptionally"
graceful and entrancing “Hello
Mexico."

Performances by larger groups
were equally impressive with their
visually inicrcsling movements.

Allin all. the Showstopper was the

house lights dimmed. the
underwater pool lamps provided the
perfect backdrop for the lively.

swimmer with seeming case and few.

“On Tour" itself was a
sltowstopper. Credit is also due

assistants Dave Amcll and Sylvia

this annual show for a growing and
exciting sport of the future. Team
