‘ Coach Ted Earl sat calmly in his
chair near center court at University
Gym Wednesday night as he watched
his volleyball squad defeat both New
Paltz and Cortland.

Calmly. that is. until the Danes
began to make one of their strong
runs of eight. nine or IO points in a
row — then he would help the
momentum grow along with the
other team members as they became
the most enthusiastic and

 

     

vociferous fans in the building.

The enthusiasm obviously helped
as Albany shook off the rustiness of
a week‘s layoff to win two matches
and improve their record to 7-3 on
the season.

The Spikers took on the winiess
New Paltz squad first. but Albany
came out ﬁat. possibly as a result of
the long time in between
competition. They_took a 12-2 lead
'in the opening game before ,
struggling to a l5-6 victory.

The two squads battled evenly
throughout the second game. with
the score being tied for the fourth
time at ll. That's when sophomore
Gary Becker took over. ﬁnishing
three points with strong spikes to
lead the Danes to a l5-il win.

Albany looked like they would
make it three straight as they took a
commanding l0-l lead in the third
game. The Danes often have
problems in this situation as they
hecomctoo careful and let their
opponents oack into the contest.

The hustling New l’altt. team took
full advantage. winning l0
consecutive points to triumph l6-l4
and force the match to the fourth
game. The Danes bad game point at
14-6 before the visitors gained the
momentum. The loss seemed to
awaken Earl's club as they came
alive. taking a 9-2 lead in the next
game and coasted to a l5-4 win to
clinch the match 3-l.

"We were flat against New Pain.
and overconfident." said Earl.
“They are in a rebuilding year. and
it's unfortunate they‘re not the
power they used to be. Give them
credit though they hustled the whole
wa “

Cortland was somewhat of a
grudge match for the Danes because
the Red Dragons had defeated them
last season. “We deﬁnitely had a
score to settle." Earl said.

With his team down 9-3 Earl
called a time-out and advised the
Danes that they were being too
cautious. “We needed to be more
aggressive." said Earl. “We were
trying to cut things too ﬁne."

The Danes fought back to even
the score at l2 behind the hittingand
blocking of the front liners Becker.

The teams exchanged chances to
serve without many points being
scored. Howie Nuisinov did the big
Albany hitting in that sequence.

Earl then put in his best server;
senior Eric Stern. He used his
sidewinding serve to win the last two
points and win the game for Albany
l5-13. .

Cortland started the second game
like gattgbusters. taking a 5-0 lead.

Dane Swimmers Finish Fourth In SUNYAC’s

by Jack Weinbaum

The l978-79 season ofﬁcially
came to an end Saturday for the
Albany State men's swimming team
with a fourth place finish in the
SUNYAC championships at
Geneseo. Amassing l59 points over
the three day competition. the
Danes were able to beat out seven of
the II teams in the competition.
but came nowhere near the
performances of SUNY‘s “elite
three." Cortland. Potsdam. and
Geneseo. who scored 467. Bill. and
380 points respectively.

Coach Ron White was quite
pleased with his team‘s performance
and he feels they did as well as they
possibly could. "The SUNY
conference is reallyatwo division set
up." said White. “with the big three

the other eight teams in the second
division. Our goal was to win the
second division by coming in fourth
and in doing so. i have to be pleased
with our effort.“

When compared to their other
meets this year. the SUNYAC'S were
more similar to a marathon with
eighteen events spread over three
days of competition which began
th's past Thursday. With eleven
teams competing. there were as
many as 35 swimmers entered in
each event requiring that as many as
six or seven preliminaries be held t.)

final.

The swimmers with the top six
times got to swim in the finals and

"the swimmers with the next six times

swam in the consolations to get a
finishing order of the top twelve
swimmers. eaclt of which would get
points for their school with the
higher ﬁnishers getting the most
points.

In finishing fourtit overall, the
Danes scored their highest ﬁnish
ever and accomplished their maitt
objective of hosting Binghamton. a
tenth that had defeated tltetn earlier
this season. Binghamton ended up
fifth right behind the Danes with 140
points.

Individually. Steve Rehfuss again
led the way for the Danes. scoring a
second place finish in the 200 yard
individual medley with a school
record time of 204.4. it was to be the
highest ﬁnish fora Dane swimmer in
the meet. Rehfuss also took fourth

place in the lOO yard breast stroke.
with a l:03.3 and the lot) yard
freestyle with a 49.5. Of Rehfuss
White commented “he looked
excellent. He really proved himself
against top notch competition."
Rchfuss did not qualfy for the
Division lll nationals but. over the
course of the year. distinguished
himself by consistently turning in
the best set of results of all the
swimmers n the Albany squad.

Other notable Dane efforts were
by Kevin Altern who took ninth in
the 200 yard freestyle in a school
record l:5|.85. He also turned in
fine performances in the 50 and 500
yard freestyle taking ninth in the 50
in 50.5. The 800 yard freestyle relay

Roberts and Mike Dwyer took
fourth in a school record 7:3l.4. The
4500 yard medley relay team also
turned in a strong time of 3248.2.
their season's best. good enough to
take sixtlt place.

Joe Shore took eighth in the [00
yard breast stroke with good times
although his times were better for
both events in the morning's
qualifying rounds. Steve Bonawitz
took ninth in the 100 and eleventh in
the 200 yard backstroke with times
of 59.4 and 2.12 respectively. Scott
Ludwigscn also set a personal best in
the latter event for Albany.

The 400 yard freestyle team took
fourth in 3.199. Roberts placed
seventh in the 500 yard freestyle.
Frank Heter set a personal best in

with the performance of his team.
“We had an excellent season." said
White. “We ended up with a smaller

UAC Extends Pass/F ail Grading Deadline

 

0’ Leary, Senate Have Final Say

by Charles Bell

The University Academic
Council (UAC) gave the go:
ahead yesterday to a proposal to
extend the pass-fail grading op-
tion deadline to the semester‘s
fourth week. The UAC’s action
leaves approval by the Univer-
sity Senate and President

O'Leary as the only lturdles
before it becomes University
policy.

promise bill after the UAC’s
rejection of a six-week option
proposal on Feb. 12. The
current deadline for choosing
the pass-fail option is two weeks
after the semester’s start.

“The approval of the
deadline extension was a big vic-
tory." said SA Academic Af-
fairs Committce'Chair Mike
Levy. who helped to draft the
extension bill. “Of course. we
would have liked to see the
original six week proposal
passed. bttt l'm happy with the

compromise." Levy said.

The proposal was passed in a
voice vote with only one respon-
se in the negative. Last month’s
rejection was the product of a
vote divided strictly along
student-faculty lines.

Professor .loan Savitt. who
opposed last month's proposal
as providing students with an
opportunity to “tscape a
grade." said that her objections
were met by the compromise
proposal.

Albany Students Unite With UUP

 

Combine To Fight Tuition Hike

by M. .l. Memmott

A coalition to fight the
tuition hike was formed yester-
day at SUNYA between the
Albany Student Union (ASU).
SA. and the SUNYA United
University Professions (UUP).
According to ASU coordinator
Bruce Cronin. the UUP agreed
to join the tuition fight because
“they realized they had just as
mttch a stake in it as we (studen-
ts) do.”

The UUP represents all
SUNY faculty as their
bargaining agent and ttnion.
English Professor and UUP
member Myron Taylor said
yesterday that the new coalition
is the first such union between
students and faculty at SUNYA
“to the best of my knowledge."
Taylor was present at the
tneeting between SA President
Paul Feldman. Cronin. SUNYA
UUP President .lt)liil Reilly. and
SUNYA UUP Vice-President
George Mitchell. where the
coalition was formed.

“We basically went to the
UUP to ask their support and
direct participation in the fight

against the tuition hike." said
Fcldman. "We asked for their
help in making sure that studen—
ts won’t be penalized for
missing classes cancelled. They
promised to send letters to all
their members at SUNYA
asking them not to penalize
students. The UUP couldn't
really ask the faculty to cancel
classes. however, and we respect
that position."

“They also said they would
give us money for such things as
posters. stickers. and other
items we’ll need for the
protest.” said Feldman.

The protest. scheduled for
March 21 at the capital is in
response to attempts to raise the
tuition for lower division SUNY
students by $150 a year. The

SUNY Board of Trustees
Executive Committee has

already approved that increase.
and the entire Board will vote
on the issue in April.
Deficiencies in the Gover-
nor's Budget total ap-
proximately $9.1 million for

SUNY. The tuition hike is one

proposal to make up that

deficit. SUNY Chancellor Clif—

ton Wharton recommended it to
the Executive Committee.
According to Cronin. the

UUP at SUNYA agrees with
both the SA and ASU that a rise
in tuition would be detrimental
to SUNY.

“With tuition up. enrollment

week pass-fail option would
lead to students using their mid-
term grades as the basis of their
decision." Savitt said. “i don’t
feel that’s the proper use of the
pass-fail option."

Savitt said that she feels the
fottr week deadline is
"reasonably far enough into the
semester so that students can
make the pass-fail decision
based on the nature of the cour-
se. but not so far that grades
will inﬂuence their decision."

Professor Malcolm Sherman
was the only committee member
to oppose yesterday's proposal.
saying that while he would not
be "unhappy" if the proposal
became University policy. he
nevertheless opposes the exten—
sion on principle.

“While tlterc may be some
situations in which a student
will wish to drop a course
because the nature of the course
was not what he expected. I
think those instances are ill]-
common." Sherman said.

“Most often." he added. “a
student ttses the pass-fail option
to tttanipulalc grades."

Sherman said that lit the
courses he teaches. most studen-
ts have a “fair opportunity" to
receive some type of grade by
the fourth week,

Sherman added that he felt

“hypoeritical”. He said that the
rationale masked the true
motives for supporting the bill.
