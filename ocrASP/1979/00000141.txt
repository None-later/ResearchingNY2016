first two rings were completely
evacuated by the state last
summer. during the height of
political campaigns.

“Political pressure was
placed on Governor Carey and
various agencies," Gibbs said.
“Now we don’t have that
political pull--the elections are
over." ’

Gibbs said her organization is
planning to protest the state’s
decisions. She wants the state to
finance evacuation.

Although Daly agrees with
Gibbs that current programs are
not adequately financed to han-
die the situation, he feels that

the federal government, rather
than the state. should increase
its funding of the evacuation ef-
fort.

Carter Extends Mid-East
Peace Gamble By A Day

JERUSALEM (AP) President "

Carter extended. his peace gam-
ble by one day Monday amid
increasing signs that he will
return home without a peace
treaty between Egypt and Israel.

En route home Tuesday, Car-
ter will stop at the Cairo airport
to talk with President Anwar
Sadat about the negotiations in
Israel.

“We can't close the door on a
breakthrough. but as of now we
have not achieved what we set
out to do." an American of-
ficial said.

US. Secretary of State Cyrus
R. Vance, who originally plan-
ned to remain in the Middle

'East to continue mediating, was '

preparing to fly home with Car-
ter instead, officials said.

The White House made no
effort to claim success for Car-
ter’s daring six-day mission to
Egypt and Israel.

White House press secretary
Jody Powell said the decision to
end the talks here was mutual.

He said he did not know where

the peace process would go
from there.
