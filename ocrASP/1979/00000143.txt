Chlld Molesters

Maine Representative Joyce
Lewis -I- up with what she
says all!!! h I way to deter sex
offenders.

Lewis has drafted legislation
calling for convicted child molesters
to be surgically rendered sexually
impotent.

Under the bill, male offenders
would be punished by the removal of
the nerves within the penis that
control the ability to have an
erection. Women child molesters
would have their ovaries removed.

Lewis says the bill would not be to
seek vengeance on child molesters
but simply to “protect children."
Said Lewis: "it would scare a lot of
them (molesters) and ifitdidn‘t,and
they were convicted. they certainly
wouldn't do it again."

Socialltls

Are people who have social
diseases more social?

The answer is yes, according to at
least one Purdue University
researcher.

Associate Professor of Health at
Purdue, Doctor William Yarber,
says he studied students at seven
American colleges and universities
who contracted sexually-
transmissabie diseases, including
syphilis. gonorrhea, and herpes
virus.

Yarber says he found that
students who had had infections
seemed to possess more social
attributes, such as self assurance.

serlous Cereal

Are you ready for radioactive
cereal?

Friends of the Earth isn‘t. Th:
environmental group has ﬁled a
complaint with the California State
Public Utilities Commission
charging that spokespeople for
Paciﬁc Gas and Electric Utility
Company have promoted the idea
that you can literally cat plutonium.

Friends of the Earth quotes PG &
E spokesperson Dick Davin as
asserting in a San Jose radio talk
show last month that you could hold
plutonium on y0ur hands without
being hurt by it. Davin is quoted in a
transcript of the program as saying
of plutonium: “You could hold it.
You could put it in your breakfast
cereal, . . .and you could eat it."

Plutonium is a byproduct of
nuclear ﬁssion, and most scientists
say its one of the most toxic
substances known to humans.

The complaint by the Friends
group, and Citizens For A Better
Environment, an anti-nuclear
group, asks the California Utilitcs
Commission to investigate “where
and how often inaccurate remarks of

Said Andrew Balwin of Friends of

year.“

Sun Worshlppere

A Florida psychiatrist says that
till annual invasion of vacationers

Southern Florida triggers a sharp

vl‘rcnsc in the local suicide rate.

bur‘lnr Leo Ryan of Nova
University says that depression sets
in, not among the visitors, but
among the regular townfolk when
the sun worshipers arrive.

The psychiatrist says that year-
round residents seem to get more
depressed and many take their lives
because they feel they are failures in
comparison to the fun-loving
outsiders.

Whaling ﬁne

The Federal Government has
established a new crime -—"wha|ing
harassment."

The National Oceanic And
Atmospheric Administration says
the new rules are necessary because
people on “whale watching" vent-
ures have been disrupting whales
while the creatures are mating.

A Government spokesperson says
that enthusiastic whale watchers
have been roaring across the ocean
on hig-specd rubber rafts to get a
close look at muting of nursing
whales, forcing the mammals to
break off their activity.

Persons convicted of whale

'harassment may be fined up to

$10,000.

Cok'ollsh

Federal and Massachusetts state
investigators are reportedly looking
into allegations that ﬁshing crews
along the east coast have been
smuggling large quantities of
cocaine into the United States inside
the carcasses of swordﬁsh.

The Patriot Ledger in Quincy.
Massachusetts. says that police have
been searching suspect boats. but so
far have not collected wnough
evidence to prosecute.

According to the story. cocaine
trafﬁckers have been contacting
ﬁshing crews who are in economic
trouble, and arranging to meet them
on the open seas. Swordﬁsh that arte
aboard the ﬁshing boats are then
allegedly stuffed with cocaine, and
the fish are brought into the US
without passing through a customs
inspection.

Boat owners are reportedly being
paid up to “00,000 for a single
smuggling trip.

Acne Aid

Here's some good news for acne
sufferers.

The New England Journal (4/
Medicine reports that dermatol-
ogists at the National Cancer
institute have come up with a new
drug they claim may be the cure for
acne.

The drug is a variation of the
active for of Vitamin A. It cleared
the disfiguring acne of I] out of l4
volunteers and was 75 percent
effective in treating the remaining
and most sever case. the Journal

if you‘re planninga trip to Seattle,
[Washington. you‘d better do it now:
-you may not be too welcome in the
future.

A group of Seattle relident,
calling themselves “Peopel United
for a Liveable Seattle." has
reportedly launched a campaign to
stop the promotion of tourism in
that city.

People United Chairperson
Robert Kesin reports that already
1000 signatures have been collected.
Kesin says that 20,000 John
Hancock's are expected to be added
to the petition by July l5th.

People United for a Liveable

Snooze News

Snoozing too much or too little,
can greatedly increase your risks of
dyihg earlier.

This is according to a San Diego,
California, researcher, who says
data from a six-year study shows
that adults who selpt less than four
hours a night had a [80 percent
greater danger of dying than those
who slept seven-to-cight hours a
night.

The study also found that those
who slept i0 hours or more a night
wrc 80 percent more likely to die
prematureiylhanthe seven-to-cight-
hour sleepers.

The study was conducted by
Doctor Daniel Kripkc, Director of
the Sleep Disorders Clinic at the
Veterans Administration Hospital
in San Diego.

Five For Phone

Reports of the death of the ﬁve-
cent telephone call are premature.
The American Telephone and
Telegraph Company said recently
that the nickel pay phones had gone
the way of the nickel cigar.
However, the US independent
Telephone Association says that
there are still at least five non-hell
system companies when: callers
make connections for five cents.
Most serve tiny individual arcasf
the country. One company
representative for the Beggs
'I'clcphone Company, of Beggs,
Oklahoma. when asked why their
telephone company charges only a
nickel, responded, “nobody would
make a call if it cost a quarter."
Nobodry indeed.
