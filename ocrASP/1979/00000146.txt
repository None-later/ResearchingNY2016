EW YORK (AP) -- Even though
e Rangers have 20 more points
on do the Chicago Black Hawks in
c National Hockev League
ndinn. m York still has to
stir: for every point it can earn.
c Hawks can just "be stupid."
That was the opinion of Rangers
ach Fred Shero after New York
ped Chicago 5-2 Sunday night
r pleting a perfect weekend for
ro's team. The Rangers won in
ntrcal 6-3 Saturday. their third
cry in thrc tries over the
riding Stanley Cup champions
season.

Chicago has ﬁrst placed sewed
. in the weak sister Smythc
sion. they have nothing to
y about." said Shero. “so they
be stupid. They prove their
w ness with two seconds left."

'- ' : nger Coach FredShero '
Says Chicago Can Be Stupid

Chicago leads second-place
Vancouver by 14 points in the
Smyth despite having only 62
points. He also referred to an
incident 5!. not two.seconds from
the final buzzer when J.P. Bordeleau
was given a lO-minutc misconduct
for verbally abusing the Ranger
bench and the officials. Bordclcau
had been upset by a Phil Esposito
crosschcck earlier in the period that
left him dizzied and bloodied.
With 82 points. New York stands
in second place in the Patrick
Division. I2 points behind the
Islanders. The Rangers immediate
battles. however. are with Boston
and Atlanta for the third best record
in the NHL. The Bruins have 86
points and the Flames have 79.
There was some worry amongst
the Rangers that a letdown would
occur Sunday following the victory

in Montreal.

“l was happy to see we didn‘t let
up after Montreal."said defenseman
Mikc McEwen. who had seven shots
on Chicago goaltender Mike Veisor.
“The coaches told us on defense to
create more offense. I wasn‘ttrying
for so many shots. I wanted to put
the puck on net for rebounds."

McEwen did so once and it
resulted in a goal for Esposito, his
35th of the season. McEwen's buIIct
from the point wasdcflcctcd into the
left corner by Vcisor early in the
third period. Esposito retrieved it
and fed Don Maloney behind the
Chicago net. Maloney sent the puck
back to Espo in front and he ﬁred it
home.

“We have a good. sound young
group."said Esposito. “I‘ve had to
learn to have confidence in them.
For example. assistant coach Mike
Nykoluk told me to stay out of the
corners so much with Don because
he gets nine of IO pucks there. And
he does.

"Our line Esposito, Maloney and
Don Murdoch clicked right off. lfl
get 40 goals. it‘s because of the line.“
Don Maloney also scored for New
York. as did his older brother.
dcfcnscman Dave. Walt Tkttcruk
and Ron Duguuy. Chicago‘s Ivan
Holdircv and Reg Kcrr beat New
Yorl netmindcr Wayne Thomas.

"We‘d be going good. putting on
pressure. then they'd break out and
the puck would he in our nct."
summed up a frustrated Iloldircv.

Absent Billy Martin ls Subject
Of Baseball Conversation

FORT LAUDERDALE, FINA?)—
The subject of mostconvcrsations in
the baseball camp of the world
champion New York Yankees is the
man who isn't here - feisty Billy
Martin. .

Poor Billy. Controversy dogs his
heels. Whispers and rumors. Rarely
anything concrete. More buzzing
and discomfort in the front ofﬁce.
Players gathering in little knots to

talk in hushed tones about the latest

cscapadc.

it hardly scents l'air.

If Billy The Kid is ridingintotown
and shooting up the saloon again.
OK. scirc him and bring him to the
bar ofjustice. Hang him if he‘s I.
guilty. [Put hint in chains.

But enough of these innuendocs.
Enough of the screaming black
headlines saying he‘s been in another
brawl - maybe. according to reports
front an impcachablc source who
got it from an unreliable authority
who shall remain nameless.

It appears that wild Billy is
damned if he does and damttcd if he

doesn't. and someone behind thcl

scenes is greasing the skids to make
sure the scrappy cX-skippcr doesn‘t
return to the job George
Stcinbtcuncr promised him in l9lt0.

Not George. “is paticncc

certainly must be wearing thin and
he must be fed up with the whole
episode which largely. because of
sentimentality. is ofhis own making.

But deception is not his style. A
volatile. impulsive man. he has too
much class to stoop to such subtley.
Besides. why should he. He is the
boss. he can make a snap decision
and -boml - that‘s it.

Welhaven‘t been one of Martin‘s
great admirers. We respect his
ability as a manager. maybe the best
in the field. The miracle turn-
arounds he achieved at Minnesota.
Detroit. Texas and even New York
are proof of that. .

But now. during this I i/2-year
period of rehabilitation. he deserves
a better chance than they're giving
him. He shouldn't be in a ﬁsh bowl.
every move subject to public
exposure and criticism.

The latest incident over the
weekend was a ludicrous example.

Some of the boys were living it up
in the local Bachelor‘s III. a watering
hole of which Joe Namath is part
owner. and maybe they got a little
boistcrious. Who knows?

‘nyhow. Martin was one of the
guests. So naturally he was in the
middle of it. It certainly must have
been true since Marlin showed up
with a cast on his hand. Whout did
he hclt'.’
