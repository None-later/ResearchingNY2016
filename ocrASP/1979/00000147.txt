Disqualifications Give
Villanbva Track Title

DETROIT (AP) -- A tarnished
victory? ‘

The smiles DI the champions from
Villanova at the awards ceremony
belletI' that. But their coach'Was
candid about it.

Coach Jumbo Jim Elliott's
Wildcats captured the 15th annual
NCAA Indoor Track and Field
Championships at Cobo Arena on
Saturday. They nipped Texas-El
Paso ‘by a point. 52-51. after the
defending champion Miners were
disqualiﬁed after ﬁnishing second in
the two-mile relay.

Other than the two-mile relay
infraction —called on Jan Boogman
of the Netherlands for knocking
down Notre Dame's Chuck Aragon
on the third leg - the meet went
smoothly.

Saturday‘s I l ﬁnalsincluded meet
records by Maryland‘s 60-yard high
hurdles star Renaldo Nehemiah.
Texas—El Paso's Sulemin Nyambui
in the mile and Villanova‘s Don
Paige in the LOGO-yard run.

Does the disqualiﬁcation taint the
team triumph? Elliott was asked.

“Yes. YouVe got to say it does."
he said after posing with the
championship trophy after the meet.
“But how many championships did
we lose by disqualiﬁcations’l Five
that I can think of. Three in the last
four years. all in relays.

“You win some. You lose some."

Texas-El Paso . which was
seeking its ﬁfth title in six years. was
the stronger team, Elliott said.

."I felt El Paso would win by
approximately 20 points if all our
guys performed like they should
have." he added.

And Ted Banks. coach of Texas-
El Paso. whose Miners won last year
despite a disqualiﬁcation. said : “I
know down deep We're the best team
and I guess‘ that‘s all that really
matters."

There certainly wasn't anything
tainted about the performances of
Paige and teammate Anthony
Tufariello. Paige. a slender junior.
won his second consecutive

NCAA indoor [000 title. He was
clocked in 2 minutes. 7.27 seconds.

momentarily. Then he managed to
suppress a smile and allay the
youngster's concern. .

“Well. Petey." the skipper replied.
“I‘d say he has a pretty good
chance."

Happy as a kid with a toad. Pete's
offspring raced out on the field to
join his companions in crime— Bret
and Aaron Boone. Ryan Luzinski
and Mark McGraw.

They're the Phillies‘ notorious
“Kiddie Korps" —- heirs and half-
pint duplicates of some of the men
who hope to carry the talent-packed
Phils into a World Series.

They are a precocious lot. those
tykes. outﬁtted from cap to cleated
leather shoes in custom-made
ofﬁcial Philly uniforms. forever
underfoot. disdainful of all the
grownup folks around them.

Secure the vaults. Hide the
checkbooks. They're the potential
bonus babies of the 1990's.

“Look,” proudly says Pete Rose.

transplant. pointing inside his

uniforms just like mine. They're

The Phillies are a family oriented
team.

They say one of ther easons that
Rose departed his beloved
Cincinnati was imposition of the
“No Kids Allowed" rule by the stern
new Reds boss. Dick Wagner.

“Petey has been around baseball
ever since he was big enough to
walk." says his famous dad.

“I started at six months." brags
Petey.

"Six months?" someone asked
incredulously.

“Six months." snapped Petey.f‘l

All of the Philly kids have picked

“Don‘t need 'em." the Luzinski

Larry Nelson

key to Larry Nelson‘s front-running.
3-shot victory in the Jackie Gleason
Inverrary Golf Classic may have
centered around a tactical decision
made on the llth hole of the ﬁnal
round.

“I had a perfect lie in the rough
and 230 yards to the pin." Nelson
said Sunday of the par-5 hole. “I
could have reached it. I also could
have hit it in the water on the right.
So I took outa 6-iron. hit it up short,
chipped up and made an easy 5.

"Two years ago I‘d have gone for
the green. hit it in the water and lost
by 2." ‘
But Nelson. who said he played
“the smartest four rounds of golf of
my life." made no mistakes in the
rain-raked ﬁnal round. protected
