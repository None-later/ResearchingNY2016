Defeats By Cornell, USMMA

Drop AlbanyMark To 73 ’ 

by Mike Dunne

Saturday should have been a
joyful day for Albany State
volleyball coach Ted Earl because it
was his birthday. However. the day
turned sour and there were no
celebrations after the (ireat Dane
volleyball squad lost matches to
both Cornell University and the
United States Merchant Marine
Academy at University Gym.

Cornell dropped Albany in four
games by scores of I5-i I. [5-7.8-I5.
l5-6. The Dattes were not sharp btit
Earl gave the ivy League squad
much credit. “Cornell beat us."said
Earl. They came to play and they
played well. if we had a good day it

could have been an excellent
match."
The spikcrs have not been

practicing wcll clinic and it has their
coach very concerned. “We've got to
get our mental discipline back. we‘re
not hearing down in practice." Earl
said.

Albany was at a low point
mentally agaiitst USMMA
following titeir tough opening loss.
They were never able to gain
momentum against a team they
thought they could have beaten and
lost iS-l l. l5-S. l5-ll.“We_werc way
down alter the Cornell mulch." Earl

said. “We had lost conﬁdence in

ourselves."

Another problem which seems to
have plagued the team this season is
their tendency to be under-agressive.
Earl commented on this: "We did
not pia.v agressively at all. We had
almost no middle attack all day and
our passing just wasn't there."

The Danes have a chance to
improve upon their 7-5 record
Thursday when they host
Springﬁeld College and Syracuse
University at 7:30.

In order to win those matches and
get ready for the Eastern College
Volleyball League Tournament.
which tltc Ditties will host on
Saturday. Earl said he plans to
"practice very. very hard this week.
Our attitude Moridity and Tuesday
wil determine itow we bounce back

as a team. If they come back and
work hard they beat people."

Springfield is a tough team who
beat Albany earlier in the season.
but they are in the midst ofa slump
themselves. Earl hopes to give them
it better match this time.

The Syracuse Orangcmen are a
very young team which was hurt
badly by graduation last May.

Along with improved practices
iiarl feels tlte team must improve
their confidence and team poise if
they want to come back strongly.

Records Set In Weekend Track Meet

by W.B. Beeshus

A "not quite as strong as last
year's" Albany State indoor track
team found this past weekend's
Union invitational uninviting for
the most part as the trackmen
finished a distant twelfth in the i4-
team event.

One year ago the Danes set a
record in the distance medley as they
rallied to an eighth-place finish.

Siena. To add insult to the injury.

The distance medley. the track-

the third leg of the medley. "We

The barriers were solidly in third
place after tiic running of the half-
ntiie and quarter-mile legs when
freshman Bruce Shapiro accepted
the baton at the start of the three-
quarter mile frame.

Shapiro had passed one runner
and drew even with the leader when
disaster struck in the form of the
fumbled baton.

“He just dropped it." Munsey
recalled. "B at these things happen

Student Is Accused Of Plagiarism

 

Author Is Yet Unknown

An attempt by the

department to track down the source
of an allegedy plagiarized research
paper was unsuccessful in early
February. according to Director of

student was accused of copying the
paper frotn one done by a fellow

protect the student from any future
bias.

Garber reported that the only
response lie received was a catalog
listing research papers that could be
bought. The paper in question was
not listed in the catalog. said Garber.

“We didn‘t ttirn up anything and
since the course is graded S/U the

The paper was done. for it English

Proposed Bill To Raise
Drinking Age In New York

 

18-20 Olds May Suffer

by Paul A. Maggiotto
Albany (PINS) The final is over.
You‘ve spent the past three nights on
potato-chips. cola and No-Doz. As
the ad says. "it's Miller Timer". or
maybe Schlitz. or Molson. or“liud".
Perhaps a shot of Jack Daniels is
your way to get “sloppydrunk.” But
if legislittion introduced by

Assemblyman Melvin N. Zimmer
(D-Syracuse) is passed [8-20 year
olds iii New York State won't be
allowed to drink.

Zimmer said there are two main
reasons to raise the drinking age to
2i. The first is the increasing

number of alcohol related fatalities
in the iii-20 year old age bracket.

The second is ti result of what
sociologists call the “trickle down"
effect whcrchy alcohol is obtainable
to N and l5 year olds froin their l8
year old friends. it is believed by
some sociologists this has
contributed significantly to the teen—
age alcohol abuse problem.

To support his legislation.
Zimmer points to a study done by
the Michigan State Police. lt
cotuparcd statistics for l97l when
the drinking age tlterc was 2i. and
for [976 when it was fit.

The study found that witile the
number of [8‘20 year old drivers
increased only 9 percent. alcohol
related fatalities for that age group
increased 132 percent. Personal
injury anti property damage
accidents rose 2l7 percent. But for
the “over 2]" group. the rate
involved iii alcohol related
accidents increased at the saute pace
as the driving.

“Quite frankly.“ said Zimmer, "We
want the lit-2f) year olds to live to bc
2!.“

According to Zimmer.
sociological studies itiivesiiown that
when the drinking age is 2i. alcohol
will “trickle down" to ill. 19 and 20
year olds biit not nearly as much to
the l4<l7agc crowd. lie believesthis
bill would eliminate many of the
problems of teen-age alcohol abuse.

However. Educational
Coordinator for the Alcohol Center
of Reiissalear County. Ken Scallon
said he was “concerned” about the

community who believe this is a
solution to the problem of teen-age
alcohol abuse,

“i don‘t think it will slowdown the
amount of alcohol flowing to high
schools that much." he said.
“perhaps a little bit." Scaion said
there are basic behavioral and social
problems which lead teen-tigers to
drink in the first place. -

“I‘i'ankly speaking." said Scallon
speaking for himself, “we can't
enforce the laWs now." He said a
nationwide study claims the chances
of being picked up witile drunken
driving are 1 out of i400.

manpower.

Scharl said that he “didn't know
