Student Accused

said the purpose of the assignment
was to teach the student how to write
a research paper. Conferences were
to be held atdifferent stages to check
the students progress said Garber.
He said the fact thal the student had
not met with the instructor led the
instructor to be suspicious.

Garber said he never used such a
memorandum before. “Its the only
time 1 did it." he said. “It seemed
worth trying to track down because
every semester we get three or four of
these cases. If we get rampant
plagiarism we are going to be in
trouble in that course. We felt we
had to go through with it because the
whole course cart be undermined."

He went on to say that in most

Dean of Humanities John
Shumaker said the College of
Humanities had no written policy
concerning the handling of n
plagiarism case. Associate Dean of
Humanities Laurence Farrel added.
"The instructors have academic
freedom in conductingaclass asthcy
see fit."

Associate Dean ofStudent Affairs
Henry Kirchner agreed with these
remarks and adding. "The faculty
has ultimate say on grading.“

Kirchner also said the instructor
could raise the grievance to the
university level and the university
student judicial system. He said a
student could be accused of

been suspended. but he added that
few cases regarding plagiarism are
brought before the judicial system.

English department members that
were asked about plagiarism said
they would rather deal with it
individually and that blantant
plagiarism cases are rare.

Professor William Krausisaid,
“Mavbe l‘nt navie but i haven't
found any" [blatant plagiarism].
He added however. “I don't think
that blatant plagiarism can be
tolerated. If suspected i would do
my best to track itdown. Iflfound it
I would ﬂank the student."

Professor William Rowley said, “I
would rather deal with it
individually. l confront the student
and try to give them as much as a
chance as loan." He also added. “lfit
persists, I would then go to stronger

disciplinary action.”

Garber stressed the need to inform
the student about plagiarism and
ujid, "if it happened in my class I
would not pass the student.

Professor Rudolph Nelson said, “i
haven't noticed it in my class. Many
times there is careless unknowing
plagiarism but my policy is to
confront the student and ask about
the differences."

At present. all ofihc New England

Massachusetts, allow consumption
of alcoholic beverages at 18.
Canadian provinces along the New

recently increased their age limit:
Michigan(21). Maine(20).
Minnesota. lawn and Montana(l9).
Massachusetts will raise its limit to
20 in April.

Zimmer said the rest of the New
England states were considering
legislation to do the same.

Vermont House of
Representatives member Thomas
Costello said the New England
Legislative Caucus. which consists
of all legislators from the six New
England states. has formed a
subcommittee to advocate a
"uniform" drinking age. This means
the various states would work
together to establish uniform
drinking ages. to discourage cross
state excursions for alcohol.

“The caucus is only interested in
the uniformity question. We
believe the age decisions should
be left entirely up to the individual
sixties.“ said Costello. “But when
New Jersey lowered their drinking
age to match New York's. there
appeared to be a decrease in the
number of auto fatalities on the
highways."

Zimmer said Pennsylvania. which
has a 21 age restriction, always had
the problem of people crossing into
New York for drinks.
