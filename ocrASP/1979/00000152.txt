Smoke Slgnals

The World Health Organization
(W H0) claims that the work
absenteeism rate for cigarette
smokers is 20 percent higher than for
non-smokers.

George Godber, chairperson of a
WHO committee on smoking. says
that in addition to the absentee costs
of smoking. society must also pay for
the medical costs ofsmoking-related
sicknesscs and for beneﬁts to
families whose breadwinners have
died of a smoking-related disease.

One result. according to Godber.
is that the costs to governments of
smoking far exceed the revenue
received in tobacco taxes.

Twlatlng Facts

Two leading scientists are
reporting that the universe will
eventually end not with a bang. but
with a twist.

Physicists John Barrow of the
University of Oxford and Frank
Tipler ofthc University of California
at Berkeley say that billions of years
from now most particles of matterin
the universe will be absorbed by
those mysterious bodies known as
“black holes."

The two scientists say that as this

begins to happen. our universe will ‘

actually change its shape. They
calculate that it will change from the
current spherical conﬁguration, to a
cigar and ﬁnallytoa pancake shape.

The ﬁnal fate of the known
universe. they predict. will not be a
bang ora pop . . . but a cosmietwist.

Mass Health

Going to church may be good for
your health.

A study by researchers at the
University of North Carolina
concludes that people who go to
church once a week have lower
blood pressure than those who don't.

Doctor Benton Kaplan suggests
that people who attend church find
comfort and stability in the
unchanging rituals; enjoy the sense
of being part of a group; and find
hope in the message conveyed by
religious teaching.

Knplan says these factors
probably help to reduce fear and

stress. which activate high blood
pressure.

Wrap Rap .

Two Camden. New Jersey
scientists are warning that the
brightly colored paper you wrap
your gifts in may be poisonous.

Sidney Katz and John Bertagnolli
of the Rutgers University Chemistry
Department say that wrapping
paper is frequently londed with toxic
elements such as chromium and
lead.

The two scientists warn that gift
wrapping paper should be kept out
of the reach of small children and
that it should never be eaten. The
scientists also say that used gift wrap
shouldn't be burned in home
ﬁreplaces, because the toxic metals
can be inhaled in gaseous form.

Poochl Goochl
A Los Angeles jewelry designer

has come up with the latest in dog
apparel. It's called "Goochi For

Poochi.“ and it's. of course. a $2
purse for dogs.

Enclosed in the statusy-striped
vinyl bag is an ID card with the
doggie's name. the owner's name and
phone number, and ample room for
telephone money.

The purses are available from
Levieux Paris in Los Angeles.

Pong Pro

Here‘s the ideal gift for the person
who thinks he or she is a whiz at ping
pong: a robot that plays table tennis.

Enlrepeneur magaline reports
that an Oregon firm has perfected an
electronic device that fires ping pong
balls across the table at human
players. The robot reportedly can
smash them at you from its storage
container as fast as no ball: a
minute (that‘s two per second) at
speeds up to 60 miles an hour!

What's more. the machine
automatically puts top. bottom. or
sidespin on shots. depending on your
instructions.

Tlred Failures

Confidential company files
rcccntly released by the Firestone
Tire Company show that Firestone
ofﬁcials were aware as long as six
years ago that its steel-belted radial '
tires had serious safety defects.

Firestone began mass producing
the radial tires in late I971 to meet
the challenge of competitors. By
1977. when the government wrested
a voluntary recall agreement from
the company. at least 4| deaths and
70 injuries were blamed by claimants
on accidents stemming from
Firestone radial tire failures.

And even after the historic
settlement, Firestone Chairman
Richard Riley insisted that there
“was no safety defect in thesetires."

However. company memos
released in secret files kept by the
firm show that company inspectors
and engineers were brutally frank
with themselves in detailing the tire
failures. The papers show that the
problem was perceived asatechnical
obstacle that could somehow be
overcome with enough
experimenting.

The recall. the largest in the
industry's history. is expected to cost
Firestone about $235 million before
tax deductions.
