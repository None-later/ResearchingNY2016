Trouble in mind. frouble in heart. the Blues of
the world come splattered across the front
pages of America these days. Look. it's not
like I don't care if the Chinese pick up the
border markers and truck them into Vietnam
a few miles. So now they tell everyone they've
withdrawa past the border. while Hanoi says
they‘re still in Vietnam. They both know it's no
garden party. Or even all those politicians in
the Middle East scrambling and ﬁghting all
over themselves to make the list of “the l0
most peaceful men in the world.“ And. rcally.l
do enjoy reading about the women in Iran
teaching the Ayatollah a lesson. It makes me
glad l wasn't born in l901. or sit on the
Supreme Court. or both. All this stuff beats
out reading “Bronx Fire Kills 4" anyday. No.
what really troubles inc is this: What the hell
are they doing down in Washington?

Even the biggest fight this year. the power

guess that means that there’s at least eleven

guys running. Speaking of the millionaire‘s
club. from Kansas there is the ﬁrst female
millionaire in this decade in the Senate.
Characteristically. she is carrying out the
Republican philosophy: seen and not heard. I
just hope those boys down there are uptotheir
same old pranks and aren‘t dreaming up
anything new. After fighting “the moral
equivalent of war“ for so long ldon‘t think l
could take it.

Now. both the N. Y. Times and the Wall
Street Journal say a recession‘s gonna roll
down through next year. and remember the
“man from Maine"? Ed Muskic'.’ Ed says a
brilarrced budget will throw us into a deep.
dark recession. What are they up to?

Fortunately. the Speaker of the House. the

4) Stay clear of trouble.

5) Propose every third toast to Brian

o) Disregard all of the above except in
the presence of an officer of the law.

Ticketmania

To the Editor: ( ’

SUNYA‘s reputation for being competitive
is even proven in social events. Why is it that
before concert tickets go on sale. people start
sleeping out earlier and earlier each time“!

By 4:00 pm. on Sunday. at least 100 eager
Fogelberg fans were signed up on a “sleep-out
list." Seeing how many people are already on
line. more people go early and soon everyone
is sleeping out! If the ﬁrst group of people
came later. everyone would. thereby avoiding
the hurried hectivity till 8200 a.m. It's a vicious
cycle worsened by UCB's incompetent
management; if they didn't give in to these
neurotic fans. there‘d be no lists to sign and no
reason to wait around for the hourly checks.
Even Madison Square Garden doesn't get so
entry!

I think l‘ve spent more time at SUNYA
waiting on litres than going to events. People
even wait on litre hours before sale-time for
bus tickets to New York City and for.on-
campus movies!

Is it really worth competing. not only for
grades but for the first available tickets as
well'!

stopped again by security (this time it was or:
second car). These ofﬁcers gave me a ticker {m
a broken directional and made me wait an
additional 20-25 minutes while they wrote out
the summons! If a state trooper or city
policeman can write a ticket in 5-10 minutes.
you may ask why it took these ofﬁcers 20-25
minutes. interestingly. before writing the
ticket, the ofﬁcer instructed me to remain in
the car and shut the motor and thus the heater.
off. Meanwhile, it was two degrees above zero
at the time. After about 15 minutes lcould sec

Perhaps this behavior was all done in the
spirit of civic-minded campus security;
perhaps it was truly necessary for a full vehicle
inspection at that time; perhaps the ofﬁcer was
concerned with my health and comfort when
he checked my defroster; perhaps it was
necessary for me to have my engine (and
heater) off while they wrote the summons;
perhaps it really does take them 25 minutes to
write a ticket. and; perhaps they were simply
laughing over the gas that one oftlrcrn lttttljttst
passed in the car. or; perhaps lltey “etc

Coping with Cops

To The Editor:

Recently. there has been controversy
surrounding the issuance of fire arms to
campus security guards. in relation to this. let
me recount an incident which occurred on
canipUs the other night; an incident which. in
my estimation is illustrative of the inability of
some members of security to maturely handle
the responsibility associated with their
authority.

While driving through campus. I was
stopped by a security patrol car. When
questioned wiry l was stopped. the officer
replied that he "estimated" that l was going a
bit over the speed limit. Apparently. l was not
going fast enough to be given a ticket. but fast
enough to be harrassed for 20 minutes. l
explained to the ofﬁcer that I might have been
going a little fast, as l was in a hurry, to which
he replied laughingly, “Well. I guess you are
goingto be late now.“ He then proceeded to do
an entire inspection of my car. including
checking the defroster inside the car! After
noting trial my left directional was not
working. both he and the second security car
which had entered, left.

l Proceeded. very cautiously to leavc
campus. Exiting onto Western Avenue. 1 was
