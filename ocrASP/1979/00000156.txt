After a week‘s respite (during which
me i had my stomach pqucd), the
arch for the perfect sandwich continues.

'5 week. we return to the sub shops.
nd hit Subway and Walt‘s Subs. Aftera
. cal at Joe‘s Caterers, this is kind of like
lumming. but you‘ll probable spend
are time in a place like Walt‘s than
oe's..

.i- Subway is one of the newer additions
ii. 0 the Albany Sandwich Corps. It is
{ingested at the corner of Central and
Quail. I guess it hasn't really caught on yet
 when I got there, there was nobody in.
if no place. save for the girl who works
 here (and she was on the phone). Subway
 ooks a little like Nathans — wallpaper
(or whatever they call it) is like old
newspaper articles. about the
 constrllction of a subway (the
ii underground kind).
 The selection isn't really that
 King Crab.
'l'una. Genoa, Bologna. Cheese.
 Pepperoni. Sausage. l’astrami. Ham.
 Turkey. Roast Beef. Shrimp. Meatball 
tu‘cli collie to think of it. i guess they do
have tilcir share of meat. butwhat makes
Subway somewhat special is the extras
that aren't extra. On your sub you can
' have any (or all) of the following:
’ American Cheese. Onions. Lettuce. Dill
Pickles. Tomatoes. (irccn Peppers. Black
Olives. Salt. Pepper and Oil. Pretty good.
huh? Not being very adverterous. i
ordered a turkey sub with lettuce. cheese.
’ mayo. and onions.

Another thing: they have four different
riled subs. This tends to encourage
creativity by the customer. but all it did
for me was get me incredible confused.
The girl on the phone, too. The four sizes
are: Six inch Snak. Double Meat Snak.
Foot Long. and Double Meat Snack
F001 Long (or something like that).

. For a turkey sub. the prices vary like
this: $1.09. $1.79. $1.89. and $2.79. The
difference between the $1.79 and the
f$1.89 is that the $1.79 comes on halfa roll
 — it has twice as much meat, though, so
" YOU might prefer that. Unless you like
_. bread. Or something. 1 think it was about
at this point that the waitress began to
‘ lose me.
I And now about the bread (that you can
have half as much or twice as much.
depending on if you pay $1.79 or $1.89.1
thing). it didn't Come on a hot dog roll.
ERCPeltt: it didn‘t come oha hot dog roll. 1
came on a weird roll. It wasn't really a
hard roll; only the top was.
‘ The server cut the top off the rest ofthl:
ill. and put the stuffing in. it looked like
 “"1; flat. Let me try again: she sliced a

divot off the top (kind oflike a pumpkin

but lengthwise) and put everything in:
Now. if you were going to get a six inch.
because you didn‘t like bread. you can
throw away the divot that they put back
on top of the foot long. instead. It serves
no real purpose. but I guess its kind of
stylish. . ‘

The sub was good. It could probably get
a better rating from people who like all
the extras thrown on it —-— it didn't reailv
matter much to me (but I‘ll give 'em an
extra point for it. anyway). The price is
pretty cheap. the meat is good — it‘s a
decent sub that for some reason isn‘t very
noteworthy.

One more thing: there‘s no place to sit
down. I had to bring the sub back to the
Campus Center cafeteria to eat it. Why
don‘t they invest in a couple of chairs?

 

 

The wrong way to go for a quality sub.i
(Photo: Suna Slelnkamp)

Almost everybody knows Walt‘s Subs.
Almost nothing 1 cou.d say (unless I
describe their rat‘s tail sub — only
kidding. Big Dom) would make anybody
think any different of it. It's right next to
Bogart's. and it stays open pretty late ——
it's clientele doesn‘t really care what they
get. Wall‘s is perfect for this type of
customer u 1 don't think they really care
what they save.

Anyway. I had a Breast of Turkey sub.
($1.79) with lettuce. onions and cheese
(and dig this ~ mayo cost .10 cents.
Strange, but true.) They. too. don't have
any seats. but even ifthey did. who‘d want
to stay there? It reminds me of a Carvcl
for sortie reason; I guess because they
both look like they Were set up in a front
porch.

As 1 said, Wall's is good enough if
you're munchcd out. and. like the sign
says on the wall. “You don't have to be
pregnant to enjoy our Kosher dill
pickles." Yeah.
