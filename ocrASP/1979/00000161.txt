by Ken Kurt:

Albany State Athletic Director
Robert Ford announced today that
he has accepted the resignation of
longtime Albany wrestling coach
Joe Garcia. ‘

Garcia has been coaching in some
capacity at Albany State for over 28
yetirs. as well as being a member of
the teaching faculty. in addition to
wrestling, he has also served as
soccer head coach and assisted in
coaching both baseball and tennis.
Additionally. Garcia was a
predecessor of Ford as Athletic
Director.

  

“For the past two years. Joe
(Garcia) has coached the (wrestling)
team with a great deal of physical
pain." said Ford. "it deteriorated to
the point where he could not provide
the type of on-the-mat wrestling
coaching that he felt was needed in
our program. I accepted his
resignation with great reluctance."

Garcia will remain a member of
the physical education teaching
faculty in his ofﬁcial capacity. “l‘m
sure he will involve himself with
other athletic responsibilities."
added Ford.

Ford commented on Garcia's long

     
  
   

years of service as wrestling coach:
"Through his guidance and
leadership. the wrestling program
was started on this campus. and has
since grown and been a solid sportin
the athletic structure of the
University.“

Ford concluded with an
explanation of how Garcia's
position is to be filled: “The position
is in the process of being cleared
through the Afﬁrmative Action
Ofﬁce. After clearance. it will be
advertised as vacant, and we will
accept applications from all
prospective candidates."

For All The Volleyball Action:

by Mike Dunne

Many ofthe top volleyball clubs in
the cast will visit the Albany campus
tomorrow for the Eastern College
Volleyball League's l‘)79 open
tournament.

The l5-tcam rouiid robin tourney
includes nationally ranked Rutgers-
Nc\\tll'i( as well as l’cnn Statc.a team
that is considered one of tiic top
castci n lentils. The l5 schools will be
tll\‘ltlct.l illl'.) thrt.c brackets of five
teams each. liacii squad will play thi
l5 point games against each learn in
their bracket.

Rutgers-Newark is the prc-
tourney favorite to win their bracket
and perhaps the entire tournament.
They have been ruled as high as third
in tlic nation by some coaches.
Judging the other teams in that
section is a guessing game at best
because the clubs have not faced
each other this season:

(icorgc Mason, located in
Fairfax, Virginia. is a relatively
young program which will field a
strong team. Springfield is
somewhat of a mystery this season.
They have been strtiggling oflatc but
possess some strong hitters. They
were good enough to defeat Albany
earlier this season.

Although they will face some
tough opponents early. Cornell
cannot be counted out. They upset
the Danes last weekend and looked
tough in doing so. Pittsburgh is the
unknown in this bracket because
they have yet to face any ofthe other
schools.

Albany and Penn State will head
the second group. The Nittany Lions
tire a perennially tough outﬁt that is
highly regarded. Albany coach Ted

E'irl marks Penn State as “the
toughest team in our bracket by far."

Hopes For
1000 At ‘
Tuition
Rally

by Richard Behar

Close to a thousand SUNYA
students are expected to rally in
front ofthe campus centertomorrow
at 10:30 a.m. in protest over the
proposed tuition hike.

According to Albany Student
Union (ASU) representative Bruce
Cronin. the students will also parade
around the podium to “amass more
support" and then march four miles
down Washington Avenue to the
Capitol. joining thousands of
statewide students.

Student Association of the State
University (SASU) President Steve
Allinger said chartered buses will
bring students to Albany from over
fifteen schools across the state,
incltiding a large percentage from

SUNY Buffalo. SUNY Binghamton.
Manhattan Community College.
Hunter College, Queensborough
Community College. Brooklyn
College. and SUNY Oswego.
Allinger said that close to 5.000
students are expected to attend.

The mass demonstration at the
steps of the capitol. scheduled for l
p.m.. is being coordinated by the
combined efforts of the ASU.
Albany Student Association (SA),
SASU. United University
Professors. New York State United
Teachers. the Parent-Teacher
Association. the Committee on
Political Education. New York
Public interest Research Group. and
the CUNY Student Senate.

The rally is in response to the
attempt to raise lower division
SUNY tuition by Sl50 a year. The
SU NY Board of Trustees Executive
Committee approved the increase at
their March 5th meeting, and the
cntir Board will vote on it in April.

Believing the Committee‘s
decision to be premature. the many
involved formed a coalition and
organized the rally to try and
pressure the State Legislature into
appropriating the additional $9.!
million needed 0 avoid the hike. On
April l. the governor's ﬁscal budget
will be revealed.

Telethon Raises More For Kids

 

This Year’s Total Over Last’s

by Beth Setter

Telethon 1979 raised over $34,895
for thﬁdsWildwood School for
Dcvelpi)?ii7¢‘ntally Handicapped

of over $3l'.000.

 

According to Telethon co—chair
Michael Faber, four to five thousand
people were present in the campus
center ballroom during the twenty-
five hours that Telethon lasted. Over
one hundred acts performed. and the
entertainment committee was
apprehensive before Telethon that
they would have to turn away
potential performers.

Proceeds from Telethon will go
towards the purchasing and
rennovation of the Wildwood
School Day Camp. located in the
ilcldcrberg Mountains in
(iuilderlund. For the last eight years
the camp grounds were donated to
the Wildwood School. but the
property is now up for sale. The total
cost of buying and rennovating the
grounds is about $200,000.

According to Wildwood School

     
 
 

Director (iinny Russick he ca .-

runs for six weeks. and has an
attendance of about 60 children and
60 staff members.

The purpose ofthia camp. Russick
said. is “to give our kids the same
kinds of camping experiences that
nny other kid would have." Twenty
of the campers. who are children of
staff or the brothers or sisters of
handicapped children. are not
handicapped. Their presence in the
camp is important for providing
“good models for handicapped kids
to grow from." by stimulating
language and social development. as
Well as teticbing the non-
handicapped children insight and
sensitivity for those who are.

Russuck said that 'l'elthon is a
year long event. in which
participants make constant vrstts to
the school, developing interpersonal
relationships with the children and
preparing them for the Childrens‘
llotir. Russick added that allowmg

"tremendously meaningful." and

Telethon operations committee
co-chair Stuart Gruskin said that
“without student help we wouldn't
get Telethon off the ground.” The
operations committee recruited and
coordinated staff to sell food. beer.
raffle tickets. T-sbirts. and balloons.
They also organized students to
work on stage crew. security. and in
the fireside lounge helping
performch prepare for their acts.

(iruskin said that although “the
first hour was really hectic."
everything ran smoothly. He said
that about .100 to 350 students
worked on the operations committee
and a lot of people worked for one
shift and stayed for hours and
hours."

l‘clcthon co-chair Barbara Nasta
said that “student involvement is one
of the most crucial aspects of

Telethon." She added that she and
I’tibcrlricd to emphasize throughout
the year that Telethon is “open to
everybody.“ not just to a few select

Speaker Forum Funds
PLO Amidst Conﬂict

by Michele Israel

Speakers Forum has agreed to
make a $400 payment to l’LO
member and Permanent Observer to
the UN, Zehdi Labib 'l‘erzi for a
speech at SUNYA sometime in late
April.

The decision. announced last
night iii a meeting between Speakers
lioruin and members of the
international Students Alliance
(ISA) was made in the midst of a
many faceted issue regarding the
PLO speaker.

According to Speakers Forum
Chair Roberta l'arkin. the group
was under the impression that Terri
would speak without a payment.
Speakers Forum Small Groups
Line. which nllols money to small
SA funded groups. has a budget of
$3000 frotn which it can appropriate
ll maximum of $400 for a speaker.

ISA originally requested $2000 for
Terri. claiming it was unaware ofthe
limited funds from Speakers Forum.
lSA President Eduardo Capriles

said that ferti had asked for $2000
but agreed to settle for $400.

Last Wednesday. Central Council
member Andy Hickwit proposed a
'bill to the council stating that
Speakers Forum should not
appropriate funds for any member
of the PLO. Bickwit said that a
group which promotes violence
should not be funded by SA.

Central Council Chair Dave

ltuffo said that the bill was defeated
because the council cannot prohibit
any speaker from coming to the
CililllMlS.

“Who can define lerroism’l There

.is no legal definition. You can‘t state
who can speak or come up with a
policy differentiating between
political speakers. Couldthe PLO be

freedom fightars‘f." said Ruffo.

The speaker can be stopped if he is
not funded or. if there is notenough
security provided to protect Terzi.

Ruffo.
