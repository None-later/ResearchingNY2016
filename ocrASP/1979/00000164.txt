A decibel reading of the lire bells was taken in the Rathskeilar Pub
Friday morning according to Campus Safety Coordinator Karl W.
Scharl. He said the reading, which should have measured about 85
decibels. was between 81 and 87 decibels.

The problem in the Rat was brought to the attention of Campus
Center Assistant Manager Bill Hayes whenaﬁre drill whichtook place

on Feb. 20 could not be heard.

“We can see there is a problem.”

said Scharl. He said Facilities

Engineer Charles Estey is getting in touch with the company who

makes the bells system.

“The bells arc recessed in the walls. and the sound is being

absorbed," he said.

Schan said the ﬁrst phase will be to pull the bells out from the wall
and then to move them closer together. “We also want to replace the

bells with horns or add more bells.”

"We want people to be able to hear the lire bells." said Schurl.

We‘re looking into all possibilities.‘

bring statewide CUNY and SUNY
students to Lincoln Park in
downtown Albany. After various
speeches and chants, these students
will also march to the Capitol. just a
few blocks away.

Numerous activities including
songs. chants, speeches. and a
symbolic burning of the tuition bill
are being planned for the Capitol
rally.

“It should be very high spirited
and peaceful." commented Allinger.

The last such rally occurred in
1976 when over 10,000 students
demonstrated at the Capitol over a
$100 SUNY tuition and room fee

_ increase. At SUNYA alone. twenty-
seven programs were cut and a large
portion of the faculty was
rctrenched.

Cronin said that tomorrow's rally
should be successful in pressuring
the Legislature to consider the
tuition increase as a priority issue.
llc said that the two factors involved

persuasiveness.

“Since we have little control over
internal politics. our only chance is
the pressure of united students.” said
Cronin.

Quad organizers from the Student
Union and NYPlRG have begun to
go "door to door“ on campus signing
students up for the rally. Offcampus
students are. being reached through
posters in buses, bars. and
throughout the university.

Cronin added that' some
professors have cancelled classes for
the day to march with the students.

The University Senate has passed
a resolution urging teachers not to
give exams tomorrow or penalize
students missing class to attend the
rally.

were very concerned and
understanding of what we were
doing. Even if they could not
contribute due to their ﬁnancial
status they appreciated our interest
in helping the community.” This
year businesses donated
approximately $1385 worth of
merchandise towards Telethon.

Telethon treasurer Richie Block
said that “this year we deﬁnitely were
able to increase the community
involvement." Block said future
Telethons will expand that
involvement and relationship with
the community.

Faber said rafﬂe tickets sold
before Telethon brought in over
$3,500. Individual acts such as the
Village People collected over $325,
the Blues Brothers collected over
$75. and M. Johnson and Company
and the Pointless Sisters also raised
good sums of money.

Faber also said that Children's

Hour on Saturday afternoon was
one of the highlights of Telethon.
About 200 children and students
were in the ballroom during these
run surrounded by puppers. a
"tie. a jack-in-the-box. a
gingerbread house. and a
pantomimist. During this time the
children. who outnumbered their
student chaperones, were served free
lunches by McDonald‘s.

Faber said that Children's Hour is
very special to parents of

handicapped children who “don't
experience being able to leave their
children" often. assuredthat they are
well cared for.
