film:

As a story of two people having an
extramarital affair. Same Time Next
Year has a familiar theme. But that is
where the similiarities end.

Alan Aida and Ellen Burstyn play
George and Doris. With two minor
exceptions, they have the only speaking
parts in the movie. The setting (a summer
cottage) is equally simple. Doris and
Georgy meet. fall in love. andtheir affair
lasts 26 years. The only catch is. they
rendezvous only once a year, (The same
time, of course). Staying at the same
cottage resort. they meet at dinner. and
ultimately spend the night together.

The coincidence oftheir ﬁrst meetingis
almost frustratingly laid out in front of
you. George is an accountant, and ﬂies to
California the same weekend every year
to do an old friend's business acconnts.
Doris goes to a convent for a “retreat”
that same weekend, every year.

We watch George and Doris grow
together throughout the course of the
movie. Their first tryst plays up George's
immaturity and guilt. Doris is portrayed
as a naive, unlearned young wife. Both
Aida and Burstyn are successful in their
acting here.

As they meet through tie years, (we see
l951, 56, 6|. 66, 7i and 77) George and
Doris change tremendously. George
progresses from a free spirited. yet
conscious man, who unsuccessfully tries
to hide his insecurity, to a stiff “straight
man", to an over-age hippe self—taught
psychoanalyst. to an enjoyany mellow
senior citizen. Burstyn plays her

character‘s changes to an accurate
extreme. She turns sophisticatc. ﬂower-
child. successful business woman and
ﬁnally, a woman of all qualities.

The best moments of the movie are
those that characterize Alda‘stenderness.
in l96l we see George deliver Doris‘
child. Aida is stunningly comic as he frets
while calling a doctor. and then goes into
an hysterical labor. The synchronization
of Aida to Burstyn's moves is perfect.
Eventually. he snaps out of it. and
delivers the baby himself.

One of Burstyn‘s best moments are in
her stage of a flower child. in addition to
looking striking. in an outlandish outfit.

Miss Burtsyn is at her wittiest here. She
retorts quickly to every line Aida has.
mostly concerning their radically
different political views. The scene has a
climatic ending, and you see that Doris
hasn‘t changed as much as you originally
thought she did. it is. without exception,
one of Burstyn's most glorious moments
in the film.

in i97l Doris is a success in the
business world, yet having marital
problems. Her husband calls the number
he is left with. and reaches George. Doris
is out, and George takes this opportunity
to tell her husband that they should work
out their problems. He introduces himself
as the priest from the retreat. Alda‘s
tenderness here is most evident by
watching the genuine love on his face. as
he tells the husband of the woman her
loves to give her another chance.

As Aida touches us with his wit,
Burstyn captivates us with the
naturalness of her character. You fall in
love with George and Doris as they fall in

 

ELLEN BURSTYN
love with eachother:

Eilen Burstyn‘s acting is good.
exceptional only in a few places. She
compliments Aida to the fullest degree.
Alan Alda‘s acting is superb though. it
could be slated as some of the best scenes
he ever done. He does have the best lines.
and byfar, takes the spotlight with his
charm.

Technically the movie is a gem. There
are no incidental repeitions of anything.
We never see George and Doris making
love. We hear them talk. We watch

them look at cachother. it's enough. As .

ﬂlda and Burstun In “Same Time Next Year"

an interlude between meetings, black and
white photographs ﬂash on the screen
showing us highlights of those 26 years,
while the theme song. “The Last Time 1
Felt Like This" plays in the background.
These scenes range from wartime sights.
presidential highlights, to Fonzie and
Star Wars. This interlude is almost
necessary. While you watch and enjoy
this pleasant melody, you have a chance
to let the previous scene sink in. and get
psyched for the next one.

The story never ends for two reasons.
One in the ﬁnal enocunter we see, they are
matured. and have been involved in this
affair for 26 years. We watch asthey must
come to a ﬁnal decision about their lives.
Secondly. George, Doris, Aida and
Burstyn linger in your hearts for a long

time. -
Desperation is a theme of the movie.
George and Doris are desperately in love
desperately trying to grow up. and ﬁnd
themselves, and desperately human.
