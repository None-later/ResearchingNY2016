The survey by the Environmental
Protection Agency of cars built since
[973 found that only 31 percent, less
than one in three. of the autos
currently have properly operating
anti-smog equipment.

EPA investigators concluded that
in l9 percent of the defective
vehicles. motorists had deliberately

 

disconnected the devices and that in
48 percent of the cars. the anti-smog
devices had “probably” been
intentionally disconnected.

Tampering, while illegal. is often
done to improve mileage or to
permit the use of leaded gasoline.
The EPA estimates that a tampered
car, after 50.000 miles of wear. is
likely to spew out fourtimes as much
pollution as it should.

VIRGIN VIRTUE
A tribal chief in South Africa is
trying to stem prostitution and

immorality among his people by‘

offering a prize to the region that
produces the most virgins.

The Zulu Chieftan has promised a
bull to the area under hisjurisdiction
which displays the most virtue.

The Chief has dispatched a team
of examiners. consisting of seven
trusted elderly women, to examine
all unmarried women in an effort to
determine their virginity.

According to the report. hundreds
of unmarried women have fled to
nearby cities. saying they will return
home only after the contest is over.
The Chief claims that most of the
parents in the area are completely
behind him.

MEDIFRAUD

A Medicaid computer in Ohio has
reportedly authorized the issuance
of birth control pills to a
menstruating man; dental fluoride
treatments for a toothless baby: and
funds for major heart surgery that
took place at home.

These errors and others were
apparently uncovered during a five-
year test of Medicaid computer
systems conducted by the
Government's general accounting
office.

Federal investigators ran a
punched-card test of ﬁctitious
medical cases through the State of
Ohio‘s computerized system. and
found that 12 percent Were accepted
despite obvious errors.

Ohio officials defended the
authorization of birth control pills
for menstruating males and fluoride
treatments for toothless infants.
stating that the claims were so off-
the-wall there is no reason to install
safeguards in the computer against
them.

Madison took an "interest

Far down on the list of 97
