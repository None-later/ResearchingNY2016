Danes visit West Point Wednesday
night.

Earl was not unhappy with his
team‘s play this weekend. “We lost.
but we played well.” he said. “We
continue to build our mental
psyche."

Albany is currently 0-l in their
division of the EVCL but have three
matches remaining in which to gain a
playoff birth. Two of those are
against Rochester while the third
with Cornell will be played only if
both schools can agree on a date. If
not, the Danes would win because of
a forfeit.
