Garcia Remembers

continued from page 23

Garcia speaks highly of his
colleagues over the years. “The
coaches who have come through
here have been quality people. In
1950, the staff consisted of two men
and two women. and has expanded
to the considerably larger staff of
today. The students who have been
coached here were admitted because
of their scholastic capabilities and
while that‘s created some
recruitment problems. we‘ve still had
many fine scholar-athletes pass
throtigh this school."

As Garcia has initiated the Albany
wrestling program. football coach
Bob Ford‘s situation was similinr. “I
watched Bob Ford come in here and
build it football program from
scratch. Coming from Springﬁeld
rind St. Lawrence with their line
luciiitics. I would have turned tail,
htit Ford built it highly successful
program."

The same could he said of Joe
Garcia and his development of the
soccer and wrestling programs here.
“Jot: Garcia is an institution at this
University." said Ford. “He was
instrumental in cxpandingthe sports

program on this campus— not only

the ones he coached. He could be
considered an architect in his own
right, charting a course for his spans
programs. He's one of the best
teachers of athletic skills I've ever
met, and has been sincerely
interested in the young people he has
coached. He's a professional in every
sense of the word.”

Garcia spoke of two longtime
friends and coaching colleagues at
Albany, men who have been here
since it was a teachers’ college,
basketball coach Dick Sauers and
track coach Bob Munsey. “Dick
Sauers came here in I954. and has
compiled an impressive, winning
program here. coaching his teams to
the NCAA's several times. and he's
never had a losing season. Munsey
has been another mainstay of the
athletic program here, and is

r "" for the inception and
continuance of a fine Albany track
program.“

Garcia is in part responsible for
equipment manager Benny Siegel
being part of the Albany sports
scene. “In 1963, Benny was selling
ski equipment in the Capital
District area. I told him about the
job opening at the new school, and
before you knew it. he was up here
setting up in the cage."

The only thing which could have
lured Garcia from Albany was the
head wrestling position at West
Point. but in retrospect. Garcia is
glad he never made the move, “I'm
proud to see the national
rccoginilion we‘ve received in our
sports. and proud to have been part
of it." concluded Garcia.

Joe (iurcitt has been a jtick-of-all-
trodes over his years at Albany.As a
couch he‘s received many awards.
tiiid the players he's coached have
received many awards. Many will
miss him otit on the mat. but he'll
still be on intct'griil purl oi the
Albany State sports program.
