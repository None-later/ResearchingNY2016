Trackmen Place 12th At Union

by W3. Beesbus

The Albany State indoor track
team's thh-place ﬁnish was “just
about where we shotild have
ﬁnished." according to track coach
Bob Munsey as the trackmen closed
out the i979 indoor track seasonthis
past Weekend at Union College.

The 20-team New York State
Track and Field Federation event
saw Fredonia. with 78‘ls points. walk
away with top honors (despite the
fact that not one Blue Knight copped

an individual crown. Buffalo State‘s
77-point total Was a close second in a
“darn close meet" according to
Munsey. “i don't know where they
got all those guys from in one year.
but i'd like to take a look at their
admissions policy." joked the Dane
coach.

worthwhile for the Danes. Hard-
working junior Bill Mathis got back
on the winning track for Albany as
he placed sixth in the open mile.

Luis Tiant Remembers His

Dad With (Pride & Sorrow

FORT LAUDERDALE. Fla. (AP)
His drooping mustache makes Luis
Tiant look like some kind of ﬁerce
Latin bandito. and there is no doubt
that the veteran pitcherdoesn't mind
the image one bit.

But there is a soft side to the
ageless right-hander, who has taken
his herky—jerky delivery from Boston
to the New York Yankees this
season. And the easiest way to get it
out in the open is to get him to talk
about his father. the original Luis
Tiant. For before the current Tiant
became the scourge of American
League hitters. there was another
pitcher named Tiant. who did
the same thing in Cuba.

“He was a left-hander and from
what i understand . . _ he was very
good. very good.“ Tiant said of his
father. “1 only saw him pitch a few
times when i was about seven or
eight years old. i don't remember it

that well."

There is a touch of pride in his
voice when Tiant speaks of his
father. Pride and sorrow. Father and
son were separated for 17 years. the
elder Tiant remaining in Castro’s
Cuba while his son was pitching in
the United States.

Then, in l975. when Tiant pitched
the Red Sox into the World Series. a
breakthrough came. With the help of
Sen. Edward Brooke. Tiant‘s
parents were allowed to leave Cuba
and rejoin their son in the United
States. They arrived in time to see
Luis dallle the Cincinnati Reds.
beating them twice in the Series.

“That was a very emotional time
for me.“ said Tiant. “it meant a lot
for me to have him see me in the

World Series."

Tiant's parents stayed for IS
months. and then his mother and
father died one day apart in I976.
Both were 72 years old and Tiant was
philosophical when he talked about
the twin tragedy.

“i couldn't complain," he said.

Sports Notice

"That's all lasked of God. . . that I

Now there is another Luis Tiant.

preferring first base and shortstop.
He also fools around as a hockey
goalie and you wonder what Luis
Tiant. the original LuisTiant, would
have thought about that.

 
  

Mathis‘ 4:18 was We seconds off his
school record. but for him the effort
was nothing special. -

“it was sufﬁcient.“ said the Dane
runner. “it was 3:l0 at the ('ls-mile)
mark and that felt pretty good.”

Brian Barnes broke his own triple
jump record for the fourth time with
a leap of 45‘8'la". The jump was six
inches better than his qualifying
measurement but still not good
enough to take home a blue-ribbon.
NeVertheless. the first-year man‘s
ﬁfth-place was a signiﬁcant source of
satisfaction to his coach.

.“1 can't believe his jump wasn't a
winner," said Munsey in
amazement. “But he‘s a freshman.
god bless him. and We got another
one coming out who's eclipsed 46‘
already."

Another rookie. Dan Ehring, tied
the Albany State indoor record with
a high jump of 6'4" while nailing
down a fourth-place ﬁnish. Frosh
Howard Williams turned in another
sparkling 50-yard dash with a 5.5

boot. The final Dane to place was

"We didn't do as well this season

Munsey in a quick summary of the
I979 indoor circuit. “individually.

Albany broke six school records.

concluded with a warm thought.
then turned to the warm Weather.

“We didn't exactly set the world

' we has coached hundreds of
Y “My State athletes and has
'1' known thousands of students who

have their kids coming here.” Garcia
coached soccer froin l950—68. when
he turned over the program to
present coach Bill Schieffelin.

Over his years as soccer coach
Garcia coached eight All:
Americans. and over 20 All-State
players. “Establishing a varsity
program here was quite a
challenge." Garcia said. “in those
days. we had to beg. borrow. and
steal all of our equipment. We were
our own maintenance men. We had
to put up and take down the goals
every night. line the ﬁeld. and install
it bang boa'rd." Practices were held
in Beverwyck Park (behind
llrubacher) from 3:30 to 6:00. "We
sometimes lost a halfdozen balls ina
week of practice under the wheels of
cars on Washington Avenue."

A few years later. Garcia moved
practices across the street to St.
lvftrry‘s (now Albany High). and
tnstallcd soccer ﬁelds and a baseball
diamond. “The male coaches
encouraged student participation in
physical projects. and players and
coaches alike would work at cutting
grass. installing backstops. and
general groundskecping. The fans
back then were out to cheer. since
there were no bleachers for them to
relax on."

(iarcitt recalls his ﬁrst office in
Page Hall: “1 had my desk and

I 4 u (Ewart.

shelves in an office which was a
converted john." Garcia served as
varsity baseball coach from l9SO-55,
as well as JV basketball coach from
[950—54. “Back then. the basketball
team played in the Page Hall gym.
We called it the match box. and our
opponents called it the “snakepit.”
We were just abouL unbeatable
there, and it was something else to
see a crowd of 600-700 people
packed in. in later years. we played
the big games. like the Siena game. in
the Washington Ave. Armory."
Garcia's truck program never got
off the ground. but was successfully
inaugurated a few years later by Bob
Munsey. the present track coach.
Gitrcia served us Coordinator of

Athletics Irotn l959-6ll. at which ‘

tirnc ilt.’ took up the Associate
Director of Athletics position.“'l‘httt

wrestling. and i had to give up one
sport in order to devote enough time
to my new administrative
position." said Garcia. “i chose to
give tip soccer. because tny ﬁrst love
is wrestling.“ (iurcia went on to
assume the Director of Athletics
position in 1973. ltunding over the
reigns iti 1977 to present AD Hob

Garcia has coached the wrestling
team since he founded the program
in I952. “i liked soccer is lot. but it
just didn't have the sense ofcloscness
that wrestling breeds. in my mind.
wrestling is the most disciplined of
all sports. it is the sport which has
given me great satisfaction in 4|
years of competition and coaching.
so i guess l‘m prejudiced in that
regard."

Garcia has coached two All-
American wrestlers. and two NCAA
college division champions. us well
as ll number of All-State and All-
(‘onferencc wrestlers. In l966 itnd
l‘)(r7. Warren Crow was an All-
Arnericun iii the 123 lb. class. “It was
quite nit accomplishment for Warren
when he won the title. rind ll proud
moment for me as coach." Garcia said.
“His older brother. Clem. was
another line Albany wrestler. tin
[Hill and AAU Champion.

'llte younger Crow speaks with
equally high regard towards his
mentor. “He's been more than it
couch to me. said Crow. He‘s a very
good friend. and i probably could
never have accomplished all I did
without his bucking. He's done a lot
for Albiiny State and Capital
District wrestling."

Garcia 5 other A — ‘ rnerican was
Larry Minis (74-75) at I42 lbs.. a
runnef'up NCAA Champion.

After coaching this year's Albany
wrestling squad to their ﬁrst winning
season in a number of years. Garcia

made the decision to retire. “i had to
retire from coaching wrestling.

because l couldn‘t expect my kids to

put out 100 percent when i could

only give them 20 percent because of

back and shoulder injuries."

Garcia has witnessed much

change in this years at Albany and

commented on.the move to the new
campus. “Most people would saythc
same thing. i liked it better when the
school Wus small. We knewevcryone
on a ﬁrst name basis. as opposed to
the anonymous bureaucracy of
today. Back then. if equipment or
funds were available. we didn't have
the waiting and paper shufﬂe of
today, but that's the price of going
big.“

Bringing the soccer team uptown
was a new experience for
Garcia. “The new campus ‘wai
luxury. Three soccer ﬁelds. and no'
cars to contend with!" Garcia took a
sabbatical in 1969. travelling allover
the United States. logging 33,000
miles in six months. Hetook dozens
of tours and hundreds of slides of
college athletic facilities. “At the
time. we wanted to make sure thtit all
of the latest ideas were incorporated
in to the ﬁeld house which was
subsequently never built. The plans
and site preparation were
completed. but were put on hold."

University Gym has the Garcia
touch built into it. “We always liked
our gym. since its been very
functional for all the athletic
programs. Originally. the wrestling.
dance rooms were supposed to be
located where the auxiliary gyms
are. One day. looking over the place,
i asked about the safety factor for
the three meter board. and talked to
the architects about the feasibility of
installing rooms over tltc pool. and
that's how we got the wrestling room.
which 1 consider to be one of the
finest facilities iii the country. The
room itself is terrific. and as a bonus
it hits an adjacent classroom and
weight training room."
