hampered by a scoring error. The
inability to shuffle players could
have been a factor because the Danes
had several chances to win the
game.

Albany then lost twice to eventual
runner-up Penn State by scores of
15—4. 15-5.

“They are a very good volleyball
team." said Earl. “Penn State has a
lot of firepower, but we Were not
awed by them."

with Penn coming out the winner by

losing unnecessary points because of
poor serving.
