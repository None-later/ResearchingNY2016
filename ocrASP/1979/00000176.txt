ALE Living

according to Day Care Center
Director Joan Lawson. “Parents do
the odd jobs and vote on the rules
and regulations." said Lawson.
“They do everything except teach."
Lawson said Social Services
determines policies for licensing.
“The day care center is for SUNYA
students as well as for people of the
county.“ she said. “It provides
service for SUNYA students at a low
cost."

Lawson said there have been no
problems with interference by Pierce
dorm residents. Miller said students
are not permitted downstairs. “If we
have a puny, we have it in the
lounge." he said.

There are two guest rooms on
l’icrce's first floor to house
university students. Welly said this
year visiting faculty and graduate
students from the Soviet Union are
housed there.

Unlike the contented l’ierce Hall
residents who feel “like a family." the
students on the 20th rind let floors
of Stuyvesant Tower are dissatisfied
with ALE. John Brown. a transfer
student from the 20th floor said ALE
in the Tower “is not a good idea.
People don't get together. We can't
get a party together here. I think we

should do away with ALE. The idea
of people being pals is not true."
Brown, as well as many other ALE
Tower residents. did not request to
live in the ALE section. “A lot of

section meeting. The RA suggests
activities to each suite at the meeting.
“The RA is part of ALE." said
Brown. "She get: everyone going."
Although the RA initiates activities.

people came here to hide from the r the ALE section is self-run. Like

university.“ Brown said. “We are
isolated because we‘re the top
section of the Tower. Most peoplein
the Tower don't like ALE."

David Friedman. a freshman on
the 21st floor who did not request
this section laid he does not like
ALE. "It is cooperation. not
communication. There is no inter-
mingting. For someone who does
not want to be here. it's not good."
He agreed that the university needs
something like this for people who
want it.

Laura Milstein. a sophomore who
has lived in the ALE section for two
years said. “it‘s not as openthis year.
Not that many people earTied over
from last year." Milstein said most
freshmen didn't choose to live here.
“It‘s used as a vehicle to get on
Dutch." she said.

Most ofthe dorm residents agreed
that apathy is a major problem
although cliques are not. According
to many residents. social life seems
to be lacking. Donna Ferrara. a
sophomore. said. "People are ntore
into studying."

Towne Meetings are held once
every two weeks. Brown said each
suite acts as chairman in turn at the

Pierce and 4+2. dorm residents make
decisions on ﬁnancial matters and
dorm activities. Suites and rooms
are chosen by lottery.

According to Dutch Quad
Coordinator John Murphy, the
ALE section of the Tower will
probably be called the quiet section
next year. “We're looking to set up
the section like the Pierce Hall
design. There will be stronger
reiterations of guidelines and
regulations.“ Murphy said. Most of
the 43 ALE dorm residents in the
Tower said the section is quiet and
good for studying although most do
not plan on returning next year.

Tuition Rally

continued front page one

“We are going to submit next
week a budget amendment to insure
the fact that there will be no tuition
increase." Hanagan said.

The State Legislature faces an
April I deadline for the amendment
and approval of the Governor's
proposed I979-l980 budget. which
leaves SUNY lacking a S9.I million
in appropriations to meets its ﬁscal

requirements.

Flanagan did not specify'how
SUNY‘s budget deﬁcit for the
upcoming ﬁscal year would be met if
the tuition increase is not enacted.

Senate Finance Committee
Ranking Member Abraham
Bernstein (D-Bronx) told the crowd
that he has introduced a bill in the
Senate which would prohibit any
“present or future" tuition increases
for SUNY students.

“Twenty-seven Senators have
joined me in that legislation.
legislators representing both
political parties." Bernstein said.
Senator Carl McCall (D-
Manhattan) said that the Senators
will “do all in our power to put
money into the budget to avoid a
tuition increase."

Student Association of the State
University (SASU) President Steve
Allinger said that Governor Carey
was partly to blame for the possible
tuition hike for 9|.886 SUNY
students. The demonstrators
responded by taking up the chant
“We want Carey." only to be told
later that the Governor was out of
the state for the day.

The rallying students fanned out
across the Capitol lawn to take part
in the demonstrations. some

Sheridan to unfurl ri yellowing 48-

customer walked in and asked how
much it would be to dry clean pants.
When Amore said $1.75. the woman
said too much. “See again. last year
$1.25, I almost don‘t blame her,”
Amore said.

“When l was kid everybody went

for trades." Amore continued. “1
I start this at 8 and be an apprentice
I for [2 years. My section Calabriain

ltaly very poor. Now the kids in ltaly
rind America go to college which is
better. but they come out and nojobs
for most of them. i feel sorry for
them. theyjust gotta dothe best they
‘can. Like i say. increase price of
school. but that $150.00 is too
much."

Amore got up from his chair
momentarily and went over to clean
one of the numerous mirrors that
spring from the walls in the shop.
After taking a pair of green pant~
down from a rack and pullinga brill
of thread from a circular spindle
containing ii rainbow or yarn. he
walked towards the back and sat
down at a sewing machine.

“You know what‘s really funny
about this iilul'f." he said while
beginning to work with the tool.
“when l young man in ltaly
somebody say ‘they need lot. of
tailors in Amerlcan. go there you
become a rich man.‘ l been here l6
years now and I still poor as back

then. i think it better here than other
countries. but still. you can't get
ahead in business.”

He walked back to the older man.
pointed something out on the piece
of clothing and returned to the
sewing machine. He was balding.
but had a full. round face and dusky,
soulful eyes and thick shoulders.
Meanwhile. cheers from the rally
continued to trickle into the shop.

“Maybe those kids will get the
lower price. i hope so." he chuckled.
“But those politicians. they hard to
deal with. One worker of minejust
went back to ltaly. 65-year-old man
and marry ti 35-year-old woman.
Imagine that. 65 to 35. One ofthosc
