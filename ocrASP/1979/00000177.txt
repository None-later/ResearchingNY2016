TEACHER TOY

Robots may be taking over the
jobs of teachers if a toy marketed by
the Mego Corporationis successful.

The Consumers Union Reports
that a talking robot. named 2-XL,
was invented by psychologists to
help children learn. Depending on
what programmable tape the
automaton is loaded with, it can chat
about such subjects as sports, science
ﬁction. the metric system and
monsters.

2-XL reportedly also jokes and
fools around and may call you an
“inferior biological unit" if you give
it the wrong answer. Children
report. however. that unlike human
teachers, 2-XL never gets angry.

MARKET MARKER

Watch out. Safeway and A 8: P:
Farmers Markets are returning to
the big cities to give you a run for
your money.

The Hat-tun Globe reports that
hundreds of farmers markets that
were driven out of the cities by
mﬂpctitive grocery chains ten and

twenty years ago. are currently
returning to the urban areas.

The Newspaper reports that
prevtously. local authorities drove

farmers markets out on the claim of
inefﬁciency and health halards. thus
making the way for big supermarket
chains to take hold and bring in
higher revenues.

Now. The Globe says that

Precision haircutting is a technique for cutting
the hair in harmony with the way it grows. Your

shape with a precision haircut. Consequently your
haircut will look as good after five days as it does

SOBER OVER

A Pennsylvania Inverter has come
up with a quick way to stop drunk‘
drivers from getting out onthe read.

It‘s called “Quic Key." and it
prevents intoxicated poeple from
starting their cars.

With Quic-key installed. a driver
presses a button to turn on a light.
When the light goes out. the driver
must release the button.

The driver‘s response time is then
compared to the response time that
was measured with the device was
first installed. and when the driver
was presumttblc sober. Ifthe driver is
more than I percent slower than
normal. the Quic-key box prevents
ignition. ~

According to Quic-key's inventor.
Robert Smith. the device could be
installed for about $200 in the cars of
repeated drunk driving offendérs..
This. says Smith. would allow them

-to.drive any time they want to . as

long as they are sober.
