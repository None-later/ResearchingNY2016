Michigan St. Goes Into

Seclusion At

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Coach
Jud Heathcote and his Michigan
State Spartans ﬂed to Salt Lake City
a day early to escape the hoopla and
attention that comes with being in
the NCAA‘s basketball Final Four.
but Ray Meyer is loving every
minute of it.

“We've never been to the Final
Four. as far as I know." the popular
Depaul coach said this week from
his ofﬁce in Chicago. “But I've never
experienced anything like this
before. I‘ve had people come into
the house at 8 a.m.. follow me
around all day to see what I do.

“It's been an experience. and I
don't know quite how to accept it.
But when you consider the
alternative. I guess it‘s OK. No one.
including myself. ever expected
anything of DePaul this year. We
lost four out of the top six
ballplayers and we just changed our
whole style, from beinga slow power
club to a quick ball club.”

NCAA Finals

DePaul. Indiana State and Penn
were all expected in Salt Lake
Thursday to begin preparations for
Saturday’s semiﬁnal games. which
match Michigan State and Penn at
2:45 pm. EST and DePauI and
Indiana State at 5:15 p.m. But
Michigan State. the tournament
favorite. hit town Wednesday and
went into seclusion.

“We are out here early to getaway
from all the distractions surfacing at
this time.” Heathcote said in a
telephone interview with the other
three coaches. Heathcote has closed
his practices and declared his players
off-limits to the media until after
their Saturday game.

Although he hates being cast as
the favorite. Heathcote says
Michigan State. led by playmaker
Earvin Johnson and high-scoring
forward Greg Kelser. has the best
players.

"I honestly think we're the best
team,“ he said. But in a tournament

and suddenly we end up being the
favorite. I can‘t understand that.”
Indiana State probably doesn‘t
understand it either. but the much-
maligned Sycamores are getting
used to it. They've beencriticized all
year as a one-man team with a oatsy
schedule. and their ﬁrst-year head
coach. Bill Hodges. recently received
la letter from North Carolina's Dean
Smith addressed to “Bill Hansen."
“I‘m sure it was just a secretarial
error." Hodges said. “It isn't easyfor
a ﬁrst year coach to receive the
recognition that I've recieved and

' still maintain the low proﬁle I had

before."

Penn Coach Bob Weinhauer said
the Quakers. who played almost
strictly a man-to-tnan defense during
the regular season, will probably go
to a zone against the Michigan State
fast break.
