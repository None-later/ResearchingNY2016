Racism At SUNYA

conlnued from page one

Motta said. “Brewington was a
good athlete, but playing the
position of quarterback effectively
requires more than physical ability.
A quarterback needs ‘cool‘. and this
Brewington lacked."

Ford believes that Brewington
was given a fair opportunity to start
as quarterback.

Ford said Brewington started at
least ﬁve games in I976, his
sophomore year. “My coachingstaff
and I decided on the basis of his
performance in these games to start
Aldrich." He added Aldrich's
winning season is an indication that
he made the right decision.

Aldrich said, “Brewington had a
fair shot at the starting quarterback
position." He added. “We both
worked hard, but I was just a little

better than Brewington.”

When asked in what way he was
superior to Brewington. he said. “I
never believed that l was a better
athlete than Brewington. In fact, I
thought I would be cut from the
team becausel could not compete
with him."

"However. I was superior to
Brewington because I had better
emotional coritrol." said Aldrich. He
added, "llrewington got too
emotionally involved in the game.
whereas I left my emotions at home."

When asked to comment on this
setback, Brewington said. “I did get
emotionally involved in the games I
played. but I get emotionally
involved in many things that I do.
That is just the way I am."

Sam Halston. a former black half-

back, said, “Brewington, who was a
very good athlete. did show signs of
emotional stress on the ﬁeld. I
believe. however, the stress was
caused by the great deal of pressure
Ford and Motta put on him."
Howard O'Bryan, a former black

full-back, said, “Brewington was a-

far superior athlete than Brad, and
would have been a very good
quarterback and team leader had
Ford and Motta given him a
chance.“ He added Brewington
showed signs of emotional stress, but
attributed the causes of it to Ford
and Motta.

“Brewington had everything but
the confidence of Ford and Motto.”
said O‘Bryan. ‘\

Ford said. “The idea that my
coaching staff and I did not have
confidence in Brewington was not
true. We thought the world of
Brewingtcn.“

discussion of the Dippikill issue. '

The live year development plan-

calls for a student center ‘with
kitchen facilities, costing SSI.000, a
washroom and shower facility for
“2,000. a four-room log cabin for
$17,000. and power and water
systems for the student center and
the log cabins for $15,000.

According to Nelson and knife.
student use of Camp Dippikill is
quite heavy. “Between 5,000 and
6,000 students use Camp Dippikill a
year," said Nelson.

Ruffo states." Camp Dippikill is
booked solid every weekend of the
year except during ﬁnals week. In
the summer it is booked during the
week as well as the weekends."

Lights On

continued from page one

Hartignn said he plans to order lights
between the podium and State
Quad.

Parking lot lights have stayed on
all the time for a year, according to
Ilartigan. Before they had to be shut
off due to the energy conservation
measure in i974.

“We‘re looking into converting
the mercury lights to sodium vapor
lights." said Hanigan. "It‘s cheaper
and it gives off better lighting."

Hariigan said a “45,000 capital
appropriation from the state is
needed to convert to sodium
lighting. This proposal has to go
through SUNY central
administration. Division of the
Budget (the Governor‘s ﬁscal arm).
and then to the legislature.
According to Hartigan, the earliest
possibility for the approval and
installation will be the 1980-“ ﬁscal
year.

I-Iartigan said lights don‘t deter
crime. “They make people feel safer

and less anxious."
