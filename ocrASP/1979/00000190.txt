To call Elvis Costello a prophet is a gross
ovcrstatemcnt. Throughout history, the
great men have not been prophets. They
have been perfect fits; able to handle
reality in a unique and fragile way. The
result is beautiful - a personal deﬁntiion
of life, a reason for living, and a gift to
leave. Elvis Costello knows this very
well. and his music revolves around the
theory that you can look at life from its
bleakest aspects. and still ﬁnd the good
things about a situation and present an
energetic hope along with the paranoia,
desperate isolation surrounding his
scenarios.

Jay Gissen

Elvis Costello plays rock ‘n' roll. You
can hear the fifties, you can smell the
sixties, you curt live the seventies. and you
can sense the eighties. The music is a
tribute to meticulousness; a
conglomeration of simple sounds that
join together and mesh likca 20.000 piccc
jigsaw puzzle ofall black pieces. And in
that conglomeration. the simple sounds
merge to form a complex example from
life‘s realities. The ill—fated love theme
that resounds in “Party Girl". a song off
of Armed Forces that Elvis hasn‘t
performed yet. The compilation of
humanistic but realistic observations of
life in “Accidents Will Happen", song
whose very truthfullness makes it a
classic. And Elvis played ittothc hilt. He
cried it. It was pitiably powerful. He
introduced it as his new single. and
played it like an anthem. It was
unsettling and boggling.

Before that, he was heating up. He
leapt on stage after a decent o ening act

 

that whetted one‘s appetite for what was to
come. They were called The Rubinoos,
and they did justice to The Beatles along
with some dapper original material.
Out leapt Elvis, though, black and
white sport jacket enrobing him, orange
tie choking him. and the telescopic
glasses that hide him. He began with
unfamiliarity: A new song. He shows off
his voice; a good voice that is surprisingly
impressing me to an unmentionable
degree. His sonic boom erupted
through a nicely matched sound system
that gave his voice a clarity that freed itt

between two new songs, a move to keep
the audience at the level he wanted:
interested and intrigued, but thrown off
enough with unfamiliarity to prevent
friendly association. He was aloof.

“1 Don't Want to go to Chelsea" blew
me off my feet, and lurching into the
masterpiece “Green Shirt” began what
was a sort of shifting into high gear, a
turn to a more serious note that persisted
until at least thccncore. where it probaaly
increased its intensity even more.

something I recognize as a brave move
and a declaration of independence from
the purely commercial aspirations of his
record company for this year‘s tour.

in fact. the last three songs were all
from This Yearly Model, making it the
grand finale of sorts. He ended the show
with a tumultuous version of “Radio
Radio". and left, stunning the audience
by walking away before even an hour. not
even half-time for most normal lengthcd
shows. The lights leapt on, and some

recorded music was played at a low
volume. A good percentage filed out. but
for others, there wasn‘t any way to move.

He came back on again.and performed
an encore that put all of the elements
together that invent a great artist and a
grcaa show.

He raged through the

explosive “Pump it Up" with a new ﬁre;
the fire of a classic voice that has been
developing with the ascent of his genius.
And from that he crept into “You Belong
to Me", a subtle. deﬁnitive mode for an
attitude that exempliﬁes him; not a loser,
but not a winner. struggling but secure.
dangerous. yet gentle.

And the showmanship was exquisite.
The lighting was a bit Bowicsquc. Using
flourcsccnt, neon, and plain white
lighting with colored Screens, hc availed
himself to its advantages to the hill. The
green hue for “Green Shirt." The bathing
of himself in pure red lights. The
synchronized switches from neon to
ﬂourescent that kept the beat in "Pumpit
Up". and pumped up "The Beat."

Was there a glaring disappointment?
Only the shortness of the show. which
prevented him from playing very much
frotn the prc-historic classic My Aim is
True. the premiere science fiction epic of
Elvis's childhood. He did do “Alison”
and “Watching the Detectives" though.
and did them well.

Elvis Costello is a troubador. He
roams the world in search of something.
stopping off here and there to play the
message he feels at that moment. He has
no unbreakable planned set that he
adheres to. The opposite is more true.
His set changes every night. and virtually
everything is possible, including
digressions into country music, sixties
music. bad music. and damn good music.

The troubador at the Palace. ona rainy
Sunday night in Albany. What could be
more enticing? And he came through.
He teased.and he ﬂirted. he kept the beat,
he pumped it up. his aim was truc.and he
wasn‘t angry anymore. And that‘s
greatness.
