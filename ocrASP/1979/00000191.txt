CRUST-ACEANS

The Consumer Response
Corporation of New York has
recently published a survey of
America's skin problems. Among
the ﬁndings of the greatest interest to
skin corporations was the section on.
of all things, crusty skin.

The corporations paid some $2500
per copy to find out that seven
percent of the Americans surveyed
complained of suffering from this
malady. To put this in perspective,
this is the same percentage of
Americans who are troubled by
athlete‘s foot.

The report doesn‘t say where
crusty skin comes from. but at least
one trade publication. Advsrrlsing
Age. recommends that "crusty skin
offers a huge potential for any
marketer that can come up with a
satisfactory remedy."

That should putyourskin atease.

THE ARMY DID IT

US Army soldiers may still be
"(doing) it on the weekend in the
dirt." but they had better not
advertise it publicly.

This is the decision of the
Pentagon. which has banned a
slogan used by the Army Reserve in
Minnesota. The catchy slogan was
printed on signs and placards. and

ZDAG

has been in use in the Duluth area
since last June.

However. the Army now says the
slogan. which reads, “We do it on the
weekend in the dirt." was scrapped
because it contained sexual
innuendos which might be offensive.

The recruiting sergeant who
dreamed up the slogan insists it only
referred to the unit's construction
work.

to hell?"

Only I I pereentsaidthey deserved

West (icrmans can now be treated

Service to implement a jealousy
program. It claimed that “half the

RURAL STRESS

Fleeing city life for the tranquility
of the country is a popular notion
.. . but two professors suggest it
should be the other way around.

A study by Stephen Webb of the
University of Victoria and John
Collette of the University of Utah
has found that countryliving maybe
more stressful than city life.

The researchers discovered that
the number of prescriptions fitted for
stress-relieving drugs. mostly
tranquilizers. was greater in rural
than urban areas.

Webb and Collette. writing in
Human Behavior magazine. say they
found that rural residents consumed
nearly twice as many stress-related
drugs and a signiﬁcantly higher
number of “anti-psychotic" agents.

DRINKER'S WARNING

A University of Washington.
behavioral science professor says she
is convinced that just one ounce of
alcohol a day. or two drinks.
consumed by a pregnant woman is
enough to endanger the health of a
iL'IUS.

Professor Sharon Landesman-
I)wyer reports that all five major
studies performed so far on the

el'lects of alcohol during pregnancy
have shown that when mothers
consume an average of an ounce of

The professor concludes that just

double the risk of problems during
pregnancy.

SMOKER'S WARNING

Danish researchers have
reponedly proven. for the first time.
that smoking during pregnamy
damages the fetus. ‘

Danish cardiologist lager
Asmussen reports she studied the
placentas of 15 non-smokers and 13
smokers.

All of the women were healthy.
had normal pregnancies. delivered
normally, and had apparently
healthy babies.

Doctor Asmussen says. however.

that examination of the placentas ol
mothers who smoked revealed
severe damage to the umbilical
arteries and veins — the vessels that
take blood to and from the fetus
during its formation. Those of non-
smokers showed no damage. she
said. ‘

As in previously documented
studies. the babies born to smokers
were also ten percent smaller than
those of non-smokers. and the
placentas of mothers who smoked
were 20 percent lighter.

AIR SAUCERY

The director of a UFO research
organization claims he has obtained
sworn statements from several
retired Air Force coionels that at
least two ﬂying saucers have crashed
on the earth and have been recovered
by the Air Force.

William Spaulding. B Director of
Ground Saucer Watch. told The
New York Times- that one crash was
in Mexico in l948. and the other was
near Kingman. Arizona in I953.

Spaulding is further quoted by
7714- Times as saying that the retired

ofﬁcers itc interviewed claimed they
got glimpses oi‘dead aliens recovered
in the crush. U

In both cases, they are described
as being four feet tall with silverish
cotnplexiotts and wearing silver
outfits that “seemed fused to the
body from the heat." Spuulding is a
space engineer with an aerospace
firm in Phoenix.
