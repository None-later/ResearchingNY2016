Indoor" Soccer Tournament

Sees Alumni Take Second

Albany State’s Alumni indoor
soccer team ﬁnished third in this past
weekend's 12 team tournament
which was held at University Gym,
Albany‘s other two squads in the
tourney did not fare as well. withthe
Blue team compiling a 2-2-1 record
and the White team. made up
primarily of junior 'varsity players,
ﬁnishing winless in ﬁve games.

Onconta State was the winner of
the tournament. defeating Keene
State 3-0 in the ﬁnals. Keene State
edged the Albany Alumni squad 2-1
in sudden death overtime to advance
to the finals. The Alumni then went
on to take third place with a 3-0
victory over Baltimore.

Marist College was the Alumni's

’ ﬁrst game opponent. and the Albany

squad gained a 3-1 win. The Alumni
also posted victories over LIU (4-2),
Kean College (3-1). and the Albany
White squad (3-1). The big matchup
was with Oneonta. and the Alumni
and the Red Dragons battled to a
scoreless tie. Albany soccer coach
Bill Scheiffelin singled out Pepe

Sergovieh. and Aldo Nerdiello as
performing particularly well for the
Alumni squad, which was comprised
primarily‘of graduating seniors.

The Albany Blue team defeated
RP] and St. Francis. tied Syracuse.
and was beaten by Baltimore and
Keene State. “I was a little
disappointed that the Blue team
didn't do better.” said Scheiftelin.
“There was a little too much
individual play. With more
teamwork. they cotild have done
better." Robert Dahab, Afrim Nejaz
and Hector Ruito all played well for
the Blue squad. according to
Schieffelin.

“There was a good selection of
teams in this tournament.“ added
Scheiffelin. “I could see
improvement in some players. and I
could also see some of our
shortcomings. Solid competition has
to develop experience and poise."

Albany squads have done well in
previous indoor tournaments this
winter. winning tournaments at
llinghamton and Morist College.
and placing second twice in two
tournaments at St. Lawrence.

This relates to the bone or
contention that was primarily
responsible for NBC deciding to
drop their contract with the NHL.
The NHL. independent in thinking
as it was. refused to tailor its
schedule to the television coverage
and as a result NBC was less than
pleased with the quality ofthc games
it was gettiugto carry. They were not
always getting to carry the top teams
and quite frequently received
nuttchups between inferior clubs
they felt generated little interest.
Riley touched on this. “We feel the
NHL ’7‘) games have been exerting
and can not complain with respect to
the games selected to be covered.
You have to have good learns

Tough Tune

Perhaps the N “List now prepared to
accept this fact.“

There in little doubt that hockey is
accepted as a mujor sport. This fact
is demonstrated by the audience for
the NHL‘79 coverage of the firstund
third games of the RUssian—NHL
Challenge Cup this past February.
liacb game is estimated to have
drawn a worldwide audience of over
200 million people.

While there hasn't been any talk of
othcrlocnlstntions broadcastingany
hockey.or any expanded hockey
coverage by WAST. that station will
continue to curry the Saturday

While this may not quite quench
the thirst for televised professional
hockey in the area. it is after all,
better than nothing. and will have to
do until citherthe NHL gets another
ttetwork contract or an increase in
ratings justiﬁes expanding locul‘
coverage. Until then. hockey fans
can just—wait and hope.
