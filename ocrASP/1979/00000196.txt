In Downtown “A” League

The applause echoing through the

'Alumni Gym was not only for the
Eggs. but for senior captain Mike
Kacz. who contributed l2 points to
his team‘s 64-42 victory in the ﬁnal
game of the downtown “A” league
playoffs. Sunday night's game was
Kacz's last as he guided his team to
the 22 point victory over the Wiz
7l4.

“We really put it all together
tonight," said quickhanded Egg
guard Rob Scheinfeld. The Eggs led
the entire game as sophomore John
McKcnna. last season's league
leading scorer. poured in 21 points. ltl
of which helped boost the winners to
a I7-point halftime spread.

"Volleyball is different than other

“That's why i love it; it's really the

The AMlA basketball playoffs
have gotten underway in all four
leagues this past week with some of
the usual'mlld upsets and closely
fought gamestypical of post-season
intramural play.

in League l, a slightly favored
Grand Po Bah team was defeated by
the Staton Winston-led
Entertainment Enterprise. 60-57.
Winston had l5 points and Bob
Torrcz l7 for the winners. Grand Po
Bah, a team which relies heavily on
the combination of Willie and
Wayne Flynn. must now take the
next two games‘to win the league
championship and automatic entry
into‘ the Schlitz Extramural
eliminations.

it is a little bit more complicated in
League H. as seven teams remain
alive in the title chase. It should be a
Rim Jobs-Eggs showdown in the
ﬁnals, with the teams finishing l-2in
their division this year. The Rim

the only defeat for the Matt Antalek-
Rob Scheinfeld team.

The Rim Jobs will have to get past
a tough Already Gone squad first,

Keith Feder and Mike Maizes for
offense as Well as rebounding. The
Eggs. meanwhile. will see Back Door

Big Shots. fresh off a 49—45 opening

Tennis players in upstate New
York generally have trouble
practicing their art in the winter
months. So whe'h Robert
Harrington was an all-district singles
player at Colonic Central High, he
was looking for a backup sport to
keep him in shape during the
blizzard months.

“There was nothing to do during
the winter months so ldecided to go
out for volleyball. I certainly wasn't
going out for basketball."
remembered the 5‘4 11/2"
Harrington. a setter for coach Ted
Earl on the Albany State volleyball
squad. “The coach said l'd make a
good setter and he was shocked
when i told him l wanted to be a
bitter.“

Harrington, a junior. was 5'4"
back in high school. but he was
impressive enough to make the
varsity volleyball team. Since then
he has never let up. Often staring
into the number of an opponent
across the net. Harrington has
shunned quips aimed at his height.
and played the sport competitively
for the Danes for three years with
inspiring zest and a remarkable sense
of humor over his shortcoming.
“I‘m constantly hearing remarks
about my height but most ofthe time
they‘re in the spirit of good humor
and We learned to adjust to it.”
Harrington said. "The most
common ones are ‘go play handball
against a curb.‘ i hear that one a lot
and. ‘whcn it rained yesterday you
were the last one on the squad to ﬁnd
out about it.‘ “

Although he is a spot stancr for
Albany and one of the top three
setters on the squad. Harrington

Harrington can take a vertical
leap of about three feet. This ability
has allowed him to go up with people

advantage and foes who have scoffed

“l'm so used to being the smallest
player on the court. i hardly ever
think about it any more."
Harrington explained. "But it gives
me a great feeling when i can score
over is taller player. Against
Springﬁeld this year. I went up and
slammed the ball as hard as lcould
against a 6‘5" guy and the ball
bounced off him and practically hit
the ceiling."

Harrington has been used as a
spot starter all three years at Albany.
As a setter. he has to be aware of
which hitter is hot. where different
players like the ball and how- to
control the tempo. Earl says coming
into a game cold is the toughestjob
possible for a setter since he has to
immediately take command with no
warmup of any kind.

Volleyball is essentially a big
man‘s game and Harrington's jersey
is too large even over his stocky
frame. “l canjust about ﬁt my head
through the arm hole." he said. He
has bright blue eyes. blond hair and
his former tennis training helps him
to be a tireless rabbit on the court
and retrieve numerous spikes.

By his senior year at Colonic. he
decided volleyball came ahead of
tennis athletically. “I spoke with
tennis coach Bob Lewis. but there
was no way i could play both,"
Harrington said. “Tennis has
seasons in the spring and fall and
since i am interested in academics
and have a demanding major
(biology) i decided on volleyball;
besides i like the team orientation
more than the individual slant."

McFarland. Ted Lindsay and Tim
Ryan. it enjoyed mild success for a
few seasons (how many remember
lllb‘ escapades of Peter l’uck'l).
However. due to less than
spectacular ratings and the fact that
the NHL was unwilling to cater to
the needs of TV. as other major
sports have done. NBC did not pick
up their option. The NHL was left a
major sport without a major TV
contract‘ and the revenue it would
bring.

Not wanting to be left out in the
cold. NHL ofﬁcials moved in and
formed their own television
network. reaching agreements with
stations in NHL cities to televisc
games. in addition, other cities later
joined the fold and the NHL had
formed a legitimate network.

Presently. the NHL '79 network
broadcasts games Saturday
afternoons (beginning at 2 o'clock.
only the 2nd and 3rd periods are
televised) and Monday evenings. in
the past. the announcers have
included the likes of “Marvelous”

presence won't hurt. Last year
Albany was l2-8 and this year
Harrington. popular among his
males. was elected co—captain'along
with Andy Kinstler.

A 5'5“ setter on New Paltz was
given an unusual thrill this season
when he noticed he wasn't the
smallest player on the floor when his
team played Albany. Still.
Harrington continues to take the
joking in stride, even at the recent
Eastern Open held in University

eventually again be able to get a
major network to offer it a contract.“
While Riley feels there is a great
deal ofintercst in hockey in this area,
the ratings for the Saturday games
have not lived up to expectations.
“The ratings have at best been fair
which is surprising." Riley said. “We
felt the area‘s interest in the sport
would have it doing better. What
little feedback we have received on it
has been favorable but there just
doesn't seem to be the interest in the
