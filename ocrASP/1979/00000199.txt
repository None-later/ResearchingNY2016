Dry Weekend On Colonial

Might Sober Students Up

by Pat Franeomsno

An alcohol-free weekend got
underway at Colonial Quadrangle
last night as a project sponsored
by Colonial Quad Board and
Colonial Quad's Tower Council.
The SOBER (Stay Off Booze Enjoy
Reality) weekend. said Resident
Assistant Maria Brasacchio, is
designed to “make people aware that
there are other things to do besides
drinking."

The program. which will feature a
coffee house, a Mardi Gras party
and Studio 54 Disco serve as an
experiment in the relationship
between alcohol consumption and
campus vandalism.

Brasacchio said that a lot of
people on the quad drink to excess.
The staff has been very sensitive to
the recent rash of vandalism and
everyone feels that there is a direct

reviewed the proposal from Colonial
Quad there have been numerous acts
of campus vandalism which have
been attributed to alcoholic abuse by
those students who were
apprehended. It seems reasonable
and sensible that various approaches
to responsible drinking be attempted
and evaluated.”

SUNYA President Vincent
O‘Leary said that it was useful to
remind ourselves that while alcohol
may not be bad it is important to
keep reality in mind. He said that
according to one‘s own deﬁnition.
enjoyment does not have to include
alcohol.

CQB vice-president Mark
Baldwin said that it is important to
make people aware of what appears
to be the inter-related problems of
alcohol and vandalism.

“I don‘t know the scope of the

concerned if we have a problem and
are ready to approach it in a positive
way.“

Several students see the project as
an insult to their adulthood and feel
that the weekend‘s sponsors are
being hypocrits. Colonial Quad
resident Ira Rheingold said. “The
people who are in charge are the
same ones who promote the
importance of alcohol in the ﬁrst
place and now they're turning
around and telling us not to drink.
“Another Colonial dweller. Liz
Strong. added. “I feel like I'm back
in high school and I'm being told
what to do."

Many students are upset with the
project. One said, "Yes there is a
problem with alcohol but what they
are doing is derogatory, they are
going about it the wrong way."
Another student said. “Residence
staff should keep it mellow, all this
anticipation will just lead to
hostility." And indeed hostilityia the
attitude of many students.

“The whole idea sucks," said one

“The people organizing this have

from a misunderstanding of their

no ability to judge what's good for goals. "We're not, trying to stop

the quad. I think the intellect of these
people is minimum."

"What are they trying to prove.
that we can go one weekend without
drinking? What's the purpose?"

But for all of those who may be
against itI there are many more who
seem enthusiastic.

"It's a good idea, it will prove
whether or not alcohol is the main
attraction. If it isn't that's great. if
not then there is a problem that must
be dealt with."

Colonial‘s Central Council
representative Lloyd Bishop said.
"There is no reason why
programming should revolve
around alcohol. This will give

students an opportunity to
experience a good time without
booze.“ And then he added
humourously, “Drugs. sex. and rock
and‘roll, that's what I‘m all about. I
don't need alcohol."

Brasacchio said that residence
staff has received a great deal of

anyone from drinking. we're just
saying that you can have a good time
without alcohol."

CQB president Mark Borkowski
said that they were simply offering
an alternative to alcoholic
programming. “in Quad Board’s
experience with non-alcoholic
events we tend to find that people
have more fun when there is no
alcohol."

Brasacchio said that they were not
forcing people not to drink. but only
providing them with an alternative
to getting wasted. “People on the
quad can still drink, but
programming on Colonial will be
strictly non-alcoholic. Any alcoholic
event on the quad that needs a
special function's form will not be
permitted."

u Colonial Quad coordinator,
Howie Woodruff said that when he
told people that they could not have
special function forms because ofthe
project they reacted negatively. But
