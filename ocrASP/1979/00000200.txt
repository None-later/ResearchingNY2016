was an armed robbery report and

and their guns were pointed at me
the whole time. Then the ofﬁcer with
the shotgun got a call overthe radio.
He cam-e back and told the other
ofﬁcer that l was not the suspect. He
then let me stand up and told me I
shouldn‘t have been wearing a ski
mask." ‘
Williams said Hornbach was
ordered to lay down at gunpoint.

so quickly Hombach was seen
before Albany Police got to the gas
station to see if the report was true.

“It was strictly an honest mistake.
A well meaning citizen thought she
saw a robbery going on. She called
Albany Police and they called us.

The only ihformaiion they had was
that this was a real robbery. We had
no reason to believe this was a false
alartn. - V

“We followed appropriate police
procedure. lfwe had the same report
again. we would follow the same
procedure." he added.

Hornbach said the campus police
ofﬁcers used too much force. “When
Ididn‘t respond right away to their
order to get down. they ordered me
to and pointed their guns at me. I
was really shocked.“

“They were harsh,“ said Williams
about the campus police ofﬁcers.
“They had no idea who this guy was.

You order people to do things when
you're an ofﬁcer. They gave abrupt.
clear. direct orders. If we weren't
here. Albany Police would have
done the same thing. There was
never any intent to shoot anyone."

Brad Aldrich. who was former

Hardaway. once a defensive
tackle. feels that he was treated with
disrespect by some of the coaches.

“in season ‘76. I was injured
during a game." said Hardaway. He
added when he returned to the team
the same season the coaches ignored

“I got the feeling that the coaches
did not like me." said Hardaway.

Hardaway said that in the I977
season he had knee problems. which
prevented him from working out
vigorously in practices. He added
that his injuries made him a little
slower.

Hardaway said that the coaches

- felt that he was slow because he was

lazy. He added. “Coach Depalmer
called him ‘step-n-feteh it‘ which he
felt was very offensive.

Ford said, “I did not observe the
incidents. and if I had I would not
have approved of them."

Siedlecki said that he believes that
in Division 3 schools. such as
SUNYA. a coach would not greatly
abuse :1 player. because there are no
scholarships awarded to players. and
therefore they are not under any
obligation to play.

An abused player would quit. said
Siedlecki. and that would hurt any
football program.

Asked if the hiring of black
coaches would remedy some of the
problems cited. Aldrich said. “It
could not hurt."
