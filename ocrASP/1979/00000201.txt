PEPSI GENERATION

The Pepsi Cola Company has
encountered some embarrassing
difficulties by translating its slogan
— “Come alive with Pepsi" — for
foreign audiences.

in Taiwan. forexample. the editor
of the Reader's Digest in Formosa
halted publication of the magazine
there after reading the Pepsi slogan
in Mandarin characters. The
translated slogan had assured its
Chinese readers that “Pepsi brings
your ancestors back fromthc dead."

And in West Germany. a Pepsi
advertisement that bombarded the

IDIAG NEWS

public for weeks proclaimed: “Come
alive out of the grave."

COLA COUNTRY

An environmental group is
warning the People’s Republic of
China that the return of Coca Cola
to that country may soon have the
Chinese up to their Great Wall in
empty soda pop bottles.

The group. Environmental
Action. has written to China's

Washington Liaison office. urging
that the country adopt a mandatory
bottle-deposit system
immediately.

Diane McEachern of
Environmental Action said she
ﬁgured that if220 inillion Americans
throw away 70 billion beverage
containers a year. 900 million
Chinese would probably throw away
enough to seriously threaten China's
environment.

A spokesperson for the Chinese
liaison ofﬁce said that the country
currently advocated returnable
bottles and that he personally had
never seen a throw-away bottle.

BARBRA-PERON

Actress Barbra Streisand is
reportedly asking $4 million to play
the title role in the London musical
stage hit “Evita.”

The New York Daily News reports
that Barbra is demanding $3 million
for the movie and Si million {or the
record that will be made.

The play is about Peronist leader.
Eva Peron. wife of the former
Argentine President Juan Peron.

BURGER TREND
A restaurant trade magazine
reports that Amerricans wolf down
about 33.8 million hamburgers a
year. or about three burgers per

 

person each week.

The publication. The Nation's
Restaurant News, says that
America's fascination with
hamburgers will cause the three
major ' frahchile chains.
McDonald's. Wendy's and Burger
King, to open up an average of one
new outlet every day. including
Sundays, through I979.

NUDESTY
A nude man is more obscene than
a nude woman m at least in Genoa.
Italy.
A judge there recently acquitted a
20-year-old woman charged with

sunbathing in the nude. . V

The judge. however. convicted her
three male co-defendants of
committing obscene acts in public
and fined them SlO each.

The judge ruled that nudity was
not necessarily obscene in the case of
the woman. but it was in the men
because “the male anatomical
conformation can become obscene.
even unconsciously.

DIVORCE BLAME

A Stanford University researcher
is blaming today's soaring divorce
rate on the use of birth control pills.

Robert Mitchell of Stanford's
National Bureau of Economic
Research estimates that the
successful marketing of various birth
control devices is responsible for 50
percent of the rise in the American

, divorce rate.

Mitchell says that since the
introduction of the pill and IUD in
the l960's, the US birth rate has
plummeted to its lowest ever. He
says that this declining birth rate
contributes to the number of
divorces because childless couples
are twice as likely to divorceas those
with children.

Mitchell says that couples with
children have more emotional
reasons to stay together and that
divorces involving children are a
much greuler financial burden.
