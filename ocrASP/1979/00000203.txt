~ Pure

Click! The imaginary camera shutter
opens, capturing the dancers‘ pose
embodying free, disjointed movement
classicaaly wrought with pure energy. If
Louis Falco‘s choreography and dancers
could embody one word, it would be the
latter. Energy. movement, and unbridled
joy was what was shared on the stage of
the Main Theatre in the PAC last
Saturday night, and it was delightfully
done. '

Stephanie DelVaIle

Louis Falco is one ofthe most exciting,
creative and visually stimulating modern
choreographers today. The foundation of
classical ballet is evident in his work, but
it's freed by his open, airy choreography
— inventive, original, at times inspired.
An excellent example of his work is
"Escargot," the first piece on Saturday‘s
progam.
Central to almost all of Falco's work is
the concept of interdependence. The
dancer's cooperation is evident
throughout all of his pieces, but was
especially true in "Escargot". The African
rhythms of the music, by Ralph
MacDonald, Were insistant and
infectious, and each of the members of
the troupe could feel that, and acted upon
it. The looseness of movement was thus
made more rhythmic by all ofthe dancers
simultaneously. This type of unified
spontanaety was a key to what made the
company so exciting. The communica-
tion between the dancers was wonderful.
The beautiful transitions and partnering
within the piece occurred with wave-like
smoothness — from a soloist to one pair
to threes to the full six — all weaving and
ancing separately, yet together. The
ircular shape which many of the lines
ook suggests the snail, and this the title
‘Escargot". But the quick paced,
cnvigorating movement ofthe piece is the
exact opposite of the image of the snail «-
ycl another of the many contrasts in this
work of art.

movement which characterizes the troup
was absent, and Falco by himself could
not fill that void.

“Saltimbacco” was the last of the three
on the program. Choreographed by Juan
Antonio, the associate director of the
company, this piece was of special
interest because about 30 SUNYA dance
students performed in it. Their function
in Antonia's work was to act as a
backdrop to the dancers in the company.

Antonio enters carrying an open

newspaper, angrily slaps it, then pauses in
a frorlen, puppet-like pose. He continues
hopping, slapping, then posing, as the
rest of the dancers, clad in boldly
patterned brightly—colored costumes
enter likewise. The SUNYA dancers
made their appearance in the same way,
one by one, until their sheer number
cluttered the stage. Their stark white
attire served to reinforce their purpose as
backdrop to Falco‘s colorful
choreography. Making their way to the
back of the stage, they created a mass of
moving, milling uncertainty in contrast
to the stiff, hostile,jerky movement ofthe
troupe dancers striking the newspaper.
This use of people as props was effective.
As the students came to the front ofthe
stage, they crumpled the newspaper,
sheet by sheet, leaving a trail. After
rolling off the stage, they returned, but
this time in threes. One lay on the floor,
while the other two pulled him/ her by
arm and leg, cleaning up the mess they‘d
made. This was very humorous, and also
cleared areas for the company to dance
in.

Heavy, powerful shifts of mood were
apparent in this piece. Because the
emotions expressed were so exaggerated,
one could almost feel the dancers
laughing at their own characterizations.
They were making fun of the dramatics,
and having great fun doing it. Of special
note was a section where four of the
company members did everything they
could to exclude another one froin their
group. The mischief and slight
wickedness evident was charming. Part
of this effect was due to the
choreography, which fit the mood of the
section perfectly, but part was also due to
the charisma of the dancers. Their
personality and stage awareness was
marvelous, and added so much to the
program.

That and their strength, illustrated by
the execution of some of Falco‘s more
unusual and difficult lifts and
combinations of steps made Falco's
fabulous choreography come alive. His
philosophy of loose, beautiful movement
coupled with classic structure was
strengthened by the constant interaction
between the members of the company.
and their constant outpouring of energy.

The two rulers have always existed.
This is as much as I know about their
origin. They spend their time thinking ,
relaxing and talking. But one day they
were bored with that existence, and
wished to do something. So, having
nothing better to do, they decided to
create the universe. And they did,
obviously.

Chris Losee

On the top side ofthe universe, they put
a sign which read, “This Side Up." They
plugged the other end into the wall socket
and flipped the switch that said, “ON.”
This made the galaxies light up and spin
around, the stars glow, and the planets
rotate. And seeing the wonder of their
magniﬁcent creation, they said in
tandem, "Neat." Saying this, they
yawned. The universe bored them.

it needed something to liven it up. So
the rulers, in their inﬁnite wisdom,
decided to invent people. In
bewilderment, they asked each other
what people should look like. “Like us, I
suppose,“ they replied.

And so they created people. But they
were miserable failures at people creating,
at first. So, with understandable relief
they took all their first attempts at people-
creating and dumped them on a bubbling
ball of molten waste which was passing at
the moment. Sort of like a galactic-scale
leper colony. And they called this
backwater refuse-dump “Earth.” That

 

 

was that, they thought.
But the earthlings thought differently.
Defective as they were. they discovered a
strange way to produce more earth
“lings.” Soon the whole place was
swarming with them.
So the rulers gave them hundreds of
weapons with which they could kill each
other, saving the rulers the trouble of
doing it themselves. But the rulers
unfortunately had no conception of the
effect their gifts would have.
The earthlings were fascinated by the
devices, and intrigued with the idea. They
soon improved on them and developed
more ingenious devices for killing large
numbers of people at once. They grouped
themselves according to their particular
type of defect, and started wars. They
called the defect-groups "Nations," and
earthlings were taught to be proud of
them.
The earthlings sometimes held drawn
out, primitive rituals to decide which of
the “politicians” was the most grossly
defective of them all. In many of these
rituals, which were held according to
solar cycles (ex.- 4 years), the politicians
got up in front ofthe people and bellowed
incredible lies at them. The best liars were
usually elected.

“That's weird," thought the rulers. “But
then, we knew that they were defective."

So, to make it easier for the rulers to
accomplish their goal, they gave the
earthlings II precious gift whose prototype
was tested on a ,"'rticultirly iiistigutive
group of deviants who called themselves
"Japanese." The two bombs worked
beautifully. Not only could they kill
thousands upon thousands of defects at a
time, but the bombs also reduced the

 

usable surface of the planet by a few

 

' 777/5 some

 

square miles each time, and made their
atmosphere more poisonous than it
already was.

“That‘s neatl“ said the rulers, “we'll
give the 'nations' a few dozen each, and let
them blow each other off the surface of
the planet!!"

And that's what the rulers did. And
because the gift was so precious, they gave
the earthlings a set of laws that would
assure the rulers that absolutely nothing
harmful could be done with their gift.
They called this set of laws “relativity.”
and it was quite successful at keepingthe
defects confined to their own solar system
for the time being.

In the meantime, the more successful of
the rulers‘ creations were forming an
alliance of all the sentient beings in the

" “ME .>—

" 1 sum}

universe. They worked together to build a
level of civilization such as the universe
had never seen. Their cities were huge and
magnificent, their planets were
untouched by pollution, and their minds
were free and pure.

And the rulers said, “Wow!”

But the defects on earth had been
spending theirtime differently. They were
busy strapping bombs onto rockets, and
shooting them off every which-way.
Pretty soon they strapped few earthlings
onto a rocket and shot him off to another
part of the universe which they called
their “Moon.”

“Good thing we thought of relativity!"
thought the rulers. “That’ll keep them in
their own solar system for good." But the
defectives were not restricted to their own
sun forlong. Because aroundthistime the
politicians began to get strange ideas for
the earthlings. lnstead of war, theytried a
new experiment called peace. This caught
the rulers completely by surprise.

“Peace!” the rulers exclaimed. “Now
we‘re really in trouble." So they decided it
was time to give the earthlings a new gift.
Something that couldn‘t possibly go
wrong.

“ANTIMATTERI!!" they shouted
together. We‘ll give them antimatter and
let them blow themselves out of existence
with it!“ And so they gave it to them.

And the deviants said, “Wow, this
antimattcr stuff would sure make a neat
missile l“ The rulers rejoiced

The defective earthlings strapped a
man onto the missile and shot him clear
out of the universe. And seeing that
relativity was no longer useful, the
earthlings ignored it. The politicians
called relativity “medieval superstition"
and “Martian propaganda," and banned

 

its teachings in the defective's schools.

The earthlings built huge fleets of
antimatter rockets and shot themselves
all over their galaxy, bringing the pattern
of their defectivencss, which they called
their "Culture" along with them. Their
culture spread from planet to planet.
Exploration teams were followed by
golden arches and plastic buildings.

“Did the pure and majestic race of the
alliance of sentient beings created by the
rulers succumb to the gross base of
motivation of the defective society?"
wondered the rulers. “You bet they did!"
they answered themselves.

Soon, some earthlings remembered
how much fun it was in the good old days
when there were wars and poverty and
prejudice. "We‘ll have to get all that going
again," they said. “it sure was a lot of
fun." 7

Shortly, the entire galaxy resembled
the earth of old. There were planet—sized
ghettoes, and moons devoted to Burger
King. And at the “bottom of it all“ was a
company whose vehicles bore the cryptic
letters, “Con Ed."

This company's purpose was to gather
all the free electrons in the universe and
sell them back to the earthlings at
exorbitant prices. The electron—pushers
had control of most, if not all, ofthe free
energy in the worlds. The company sent
out hills, which also had the inscription
“CON ED" on them. They required the
people to pay for the electrons that flowed
into their homes. Each time the services
got worse, the prices went up. This was
typical of the defective‘s way of doing
business.

One day, a strange notice was delivered
to the mailroom outside the ruler's
palace. lt bore the CON ED inscription.
The notice said:

IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR
ATTENTION THAT YOUR PLACE

Editor's note: Thanks to Vincent
Sampugnaro, who submitted the star

The rulers ignored the notice. “Maybe
it will go away,“ they said to themselves.
They did not know anything about the
deviants‘ business practices. The next
notice came ten days later. It read:

PAYMENT OF YOUR METER IS
NOW TEN DAYS LATE. PLEASE
INCLUDE IN YOUR PAYMENT A
TE‘N PERCENT SURCHARGE FOR
THE DELINQUENCY IN YOUR,
ACCOUNT. IF PAYMENT IS NOT
RECEIVED BY DECEMBER 5, YOUR
SERVICE WILL BE TERMINATED.

The rulers wondered who this defect
was. They also wondered what payment
was, and what the defects were.going to
do if they didn't get it.

“Maybe we could make some
‘puyment.‘” they speCUlated. “Or maybe
We could kill this CON ED person." But
the rulers have compassion for their
creations.

“Let the defects have their fun." they
decided. And so they did.

Several days later there came a knock
on the diamond-crystal knocker of the
ruler‘s black marble palace bythe roaring
sea. "Come in," the rulers said.

In strode a sick-looking defect with
blue jeans and work boots. He scuffed the
ermine-carpeted floor as he walked up to

their thrones.

“CON ED,“ he announced.

“So you are CON ED!" they shouted.
"What are you doing in our palace?"

“You haven't paid your bill," be said, so
I've got to pull your plug. Where is it
please?“

“Couldn‘t we talk this over, CON?,"
the rulers asked.

“I‘m sorry. but there is your notice," the
defect said as he dropped the crinkled
paper on the ruler‘s translucent milk-
quartz table. He then walked up the spiral
stairway of liquid mercury, past the many
levels of the rulers palace, until he
reached the top. There, at the top of the
stairway was a parapet carved from
emerald crystal fifty feet in diameter.
Looking down at the palace, he saw a
mobius loop of darkness with glowing
spirals and ellipses of all colors and
