ASP; Fred, the critical and popular
acclaim for your character has been
overwhelming. What do you attribute
this to? Is there something about his
personality, or some underlying
psychological implications that can
explain the public‘s love for this bird?
Fred: Actually, I believe it‘s because there
are times that most readers would like to
identify with him. After all, he's the
perennial loser, but he‘s so well-
intentioned. and resilient. He suffers a
setback, something that has the potential
to emotionally cripple him, and he‘s right
back ﬁghting in the next frame. Orat least
he's philosophical about the incident. He
accepts himself for what he is, but he's
always striving for self-improvement.
And most important, he has the capacity
to poke fun at himself. We'd all like to be
able to do that, right?

But I think in talking about the praise
for the strip. you can‘t really overlook the
other characters. Irwin and Floyd are just
as important.

ASP: Just as important? That‘s rather
noble of you Fred. l realize it‘s not a one-
man show, but let's face it — you're the

so“

star. Isn't it possible that Irwin and Flo)’d

resent the magnitude Of Your “We”?

(Fred chuckles and takes a sip of the

Perrier) .

Fred: Irwin and Floyd are my friends.

We see each other socially very often. Just

two nights ago I had dinner with Irwin

and his wife and kids at their home in El

Segundo. Beautiful kids. Resentment?

No — those two' are professionals. If we

have problems, We're always able to talk

them out. I'm sure that Irwin and Floyd
would enjoy a little more publicity and
exposure, but I can honestly say that

they're happy for my success — maybe a

little envious, but not resentful.

ASP: That success seems to have opened
up all sorts of possibilities for expanding
the dimensions of your career. In the past
couple of months we've heard talk about
movie and television roles, a book in the
works. I think the latest rumour has you
pegged as the successor to Johnny
Carson.
Fred: Ridiculous! There's just no room
to grow creatively in ajob like that. But.
the guest host spot was a blast. I ‘d do that
again. Freddie [DeCordova, Tonight
show producer] lined up some great
guests for me. Rodney Dangerﬁeld,
Robert Blake, and Joan Embry, with the
pelican and parrot from the San Diego
Zoo. That was a real nice touch.

As for the other stuff you mentioned,
I‘d really like to do a Saturday morning
cartoon on a regular basis. It would be
more of a challenge and also give me more
freedom at the same time. There's really a
limit to what you can do in a strip. I've
also wanted to do a guest shot in the

Peanuts strip for along time. l think my
agent, Mr. (Irving “Swifty") Lauir is
negotiating with Charlie Schulz. We did
just close the deal on my autobiography.
It should be out early in the fall.

ASP: Aren't you exploiting your own
career by writing a book, Fred?

FRED: Not at all! It's a damn good book!
It's somethingthat really had to be done. I
think it's the first good book about the
comic strip business, but it‘s also about a
lot of other things.

ASP: You must have received a nice
advance on the book. Would $500,000 be
an accurate guess?

Fred: I'd rather not sav. But believe me.
I'm not in these things just for the money.
I could have had the lead in Saturday
Night Fever, but I‘m no dancer. Travolta
was better for the part, so I turned it
down. ~-
ASP: Fred, beingin the public eye usually
means that gossip, scandal, controversy is
pretty much unavoidable. How did you
react to the suggestive picture and story of
you with Linda Ronstadt that was in last
month’s National Inquirer?
Fred: Like you said, gossip is pretty much
unavoidable, so I just put up with it.
Linda and I are close friends. We
met at a Stones bash when they played the
Elmacambo. Is there anything between

us? Why don't you ask Linda? (He laughed) /

ASP: Before you hit it big, you were
involved in a bit of controversy with Rick
Blum [creator of the strip] about the
extent of your creative control over the
character. How do you get along now?
Fred: I can‘t emphasize enough how
important Rick has been in establishing
my career. Looking back on that incident
I realize was being kind of cocky. Here 
I was, just gaining some notoriety

Fred: That was a tough time in my life.
The production schedule was killing me,
and even though I had become quite
successful —— winning the golden commie
award and all, I had visions of still being
Fred the Bird when I was 50. So I took off
for a year. Deep down, [think I knew that
I’d be back.

ASP: Where'd you go?

Fred: Well, first I went home to visit my
parents in Arkansas for a while, I don‘t
get to see them much. When I was there I
started thinking about how far I had
come in the business, about my start. You
know. I started in a little one frame
cartoon, in a small paper back home. I
wasn't really too good. But, then I heard
about this opportunity in a twelve—frame
strip in Albany. That's big time. My
audition didn‘t go well. Ithought I‘d have
to go back to the Midwest. I guess Mr.
Blum must have seen some raw talent or
something.

Reflecting like this for a couple of
months at home, my mind was pretty well
made up to return. I‘d always wanted to
be in the comic strips, as long as I could
remember.

The rest of the year was a vacation. I
hadn‘t had much time to travel when I
was working. So, I flew down to South
America for the winter. I was very
interested in experiencing a different

lifestyle and culture for a while.

ASP: Did you read the South American
comic strips when you were there?

Fred: No. I don't even read my own strip.
Comic strips bore me. I like being in

Superstar

Speaks

ASP: Where did you go after South
America?
Fred: Over to Europe. Spain, Portuga,

The French Riviera. I even did some

skiing in the Swiss Alps. A month before I
was to return to the states, the ASPwired
me with a fabulous offer, and you know

the rest.

(Fred squirms restlesst on the couch, the
phone suddenly rings, and he jumps,
surprised. Juanita informs him that it is
important, and Fred excuses himself for
several minutes.)

Fred: It looks like you have yourself a
scoop. That was my agent calling from
Chicago. I got the [Saturday morning
cartoon] series.

ASP: Congratulations, Fred.

The remaining portion of the interview
was conducted on the beach. Fred
suggested a walk, as the weather was
beautiful.

ASP: Do you come down to the beach
often, Fred?

Fred: Yes, I do. I try to jog along the
beach every day, about ﬁve miles. It's a
problem sometimes. Girls will recognize
me and then surround me, or run
along and hound me for my autograph.
Sometimes they even make some lewd
and suggestive remarks. I know I've been

termed a womanizer and all, but when I‘m
down here, I like to “get back to nature.“

The sea is so relaxing. Did you know that
l was a strict vegetarian, also. I think
purity of body goes hand in hand with
purity of soul. Recently, I've begun to
read up on many of the teachings of
Eastern religion.

ASP: 'niat's fascinating, Fred. What
about social issues? I seem to remember
your making a large charitable donation
of some sort.

Fred: Well, that was really political in
nature. I strongly support the Birds in
Politics (BIP) movement. In the mid
sixties, when the ﬁrstl lady was a bird,
they were making progress, but things
have been slow since then. If you're
talking about social issues, though, I’m a
staunch environmentalist. The natural
beauty and ecological balance of this
country must be preserved. It really hurts
me deeply when I see people hunting, er,

let's say ducks, strictly for pleasure.

People just have no regard for wildlife

anymore. I mean, the eagle is almost

extinct. Our national symbol.

(We walk quietly for a few minutes)

ASP: Fred, what about your conception

of art? Do you consider yourself an artist?

Fred: Ahh. An age old question. What is
my interpretation of art? lthink the strip

is art. In a sense, it imitates life, but it goes
beyond that. Fred, Floyd, and Irwin
capture the ironies and subtleties of
certain aspects of life. To portray these
characters, we must 'draw upon our
«experiences. My work is highly
introspective in nature. But I do not
simply summon a past experience to mind
when I become Fred the Bird. There is a
synthesis that takes place between my
thoughts and the idea I wish to portray.
And that fusion is to me, art.

ASP: Fred, has your status changed your
outlook on life, are there social costs of
your rise to fame and fortune?

Fred: Well, I am working at something I
really enjoy. You might even say I‘ve
reached the pinnacle of my profession.

' But my life has changed drastically, and
my initial reactions to people are not the
same as they used to be. I have trouble
accepting people at face value. When I
meet people, I question their motives for
knowing me. I'm often suspicious that
they simply want to take advantage of my
status. And that nakes it extremely hard

to make friends. . . Real friends. I‘m just
like everybody else. I get lonely too.
ASP: Fred, has it all been wonh it?
Fred: Of course it‘s been worth itl Every
damn minute of itl And Fred thinks so,
too. Do yon really think he would go
through strip after strip of failures and
set-backs if he didn‘t think it it was all
worth it? That life is worth living? Me and
Fred, man, we're doingjust ﬁne. I'm his
hero, and he‘s mine.

(By now, we had walked back to Fred's
house. Fred did not go in. He said he had
a meeting with the TV people. He patted
me on the back and said goodbye. I
thanked him for his cordiality. Then he
got in his Alfa Romeo and sped away,
screeching around the curves in the road.)
