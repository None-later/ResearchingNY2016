The best way to listen to the Allman

Brother's new album Enlightened

Rogues, is to forget that eight or nine.
years ago the Allmans were probably the

best of them all. This album won't shake

any new ground, and I wouldn‘t

recommend it to someone interested in

checking out the A38, for the ﬁrst time.

Some of the lyrics are unbearany sweet.

But, a few of the tunes do work.

Tony Low

The ﬁrst ten seconds of , “Crazy Love."
features Dickey Betts playing the same
lick on slide guitar that he played on
“California Blues" and “Out to Get Me,"
(from his ﬁrst Great Southern album).
The only problem is, it‘s good riff. The
song also contains some of those
previously mentioned saccharin-sweet
Betts lyrics. Try these:

“I remember on the night I met you,
Ooh sweet baby I can‘t forget.” And,
“There ain‘t no doubt and I don't mean
maybe, Ooh [just can't forget about you
baby."

“Can‘t Take It With You,” is a
showcase for "Dangerous" Dan Tolcr,
Bett‘s sidekick front Great Southern. His
guitar solos really move. Gregg sounds
good, (a lot like Ronnie Van Zant) but
how seriously can you sing, “Can't hide
your love away, And save it for a rainy
day?"

Fortunately, we are saved by a ﬁne up.
tempo instrumental entitled “ Pegasus." It
features the funky bass of David
Goldﬂics, also from Great Southern.
Goldﬂies is an outstanding rock bassist,
and should be seen to be appreciated.
The song is a typical Bett's
arrangement; introduction, organ solo in
between tight sinewy guitar solos,
percussion spotlight, (the same
drummers, as in the old Brothers-Butch
Trucks and Jaimoe) and closing
statement. You'll be playing this one
frequently and loud.

Side one closes with a blues number
that does not work. Instead of Bctts
taking the instrumental lead, or Gregg
producing some of those throaty growls,
Jim Esscry (who?) plays a harp
(harmonica) solo that makes me want to

shapes It was more beautiful than
anything he had ever seen. And at the
highest point in the loop. there was a sign
which read, “This Side Up."

“Not here," said the CON ED man,
turning his back on the universe. He
looked around to see if anyone was
watching, then grabbed the bannister of
smooth ice with both hands and slid down
it. past the many levels of the ruIcr‘s
palace until ﬁnally he arrived at the
basement.

“Aha.” said the CON ED man,spotting
the thirty-pund lead-lined plug stickingin
the huge wall socket.

" Here it is!" He ambled overtothe plug
and took it in both hands. He gave it a
tremendous pull,jcrking it out ofthe wall,
and fell over with the plug ontop ofhim.
Upstairs, the rulers sat back in their
thrones of carvcnjade supported by ﬂuid
moonbeams.

" 'lhat did that ugly defect want?." the
rulers asked themselves. “Something
about a note," they replied.

They considered evicting him from the

‘down _a six—pack and put on Pig-Pen.

Storu Of The Universe

“It hurts me, too,” that Betta and Allman
didn‘t do a better job with the ster of
music that inﬂuenced them the most.

Side two starts with “Blind Love,” sung
by Gregg. He sounds as if he ﬁnally
decided to let loose. Betta and Tolcr ﬁt in
well with their Great Southern sound,
and I don‘t even mind the sorely
underproduced harp of Allman's limited
range on organ.

On, “Try One More Time," Betts and
AIIman must ﬁgure that two vocals are
better than one. so they alternate. This
technique is unsuccessful.

The only song Gregg wrote for the
album, “It Just Ain‘t That Easy," is
lyrically " reminiscent of, “Midnight
Rider," one of his great compositons.

He's experienced hard times since his
brother Duane died in October, 197i.
Several broken marriages, heroin
addiction, alcoholism. and the
controversial “ratting” on roadie and
dope supplier, “Scooter” Herring, were
destructive forces to the talented
songwriter and vocalist. He also couldn‘t
handle the glamorous lifestyle ofthe West
Coast. Allman makes reference to all
these troubles in the song:

“Your head's severely pounding from
the night beofre, But you just keep on
goin‘ back for more. While you‘re there it
seems like such a lovely place. but when
you leave there. you got your hat down on
your face, well well . . ."The song
effectively ﬁnishes with Betts and Toler
trading solos.

After 35 minutes of uneven music,
the disc concludes with “Sail On, Sail
Away, I wonder why lever thought you‘d
stay” when he has more pretty women
waiting for himthanapassengertrain can
hold. The solos are nice, but they don‘t
salvage the song. Belts has earned his
reputation as a guitar player, not a
songwriter, so when the tunes are lyrically
oriented, he can become trite.

If this were a debut album by an
obscure band, I wouldn't be so critical.
But it‘s hard to bcaftcr hearing songs like
“Blue Sky“ or “Elizabeth Rt ed." Those
songs were like nothing I had ever heard.
All I can do now is shake my head.

compassion for all their creations. The
rulers got up from their thrones and
picked up the note that was lying on the
table.
Then, something strange happened.
As they watched, the mobius loop of
darkness began to ﬂicker and fade. The
galaxies stopped spinning and one by
one, began to shimmer. Then. they
blinked once or twice, and went out.
There was a scream from the basement.
but the rulers paid no attention. They
were too busy watching the last moments
of the universe.
“Neat!” they exclaimed as the last star
ﬂickered, and was gone. The mobius loop
disintegrated and vanished without even
a large “Poof.”
“Well, that's that," exclaimed the
rulers, with twu long exhalations. “It was
fun while it lasted, but I don't think we’ll
make another for a few trillion acons.“
'l‘hcy dropped the note to the ﬂoor. The
last line remained uncovered. "What a
curious way to end a notel.” they said in
tu n d c m.
I The last line read, in bold type:

Next was cheese time. He went through

unwrapped the cheese, and started
slicing. The cheese slices were square, not
the long strips most sub places use; it
makes the cheese thicker on the sub. Boy.

do I love thick cheese.

 

The subs were ﬁnished. My turkey and
cheese cost $1.79 ~— with tax and a Nchi.
the ﬁnal tab was 52.3 I. l was all set to eat
(in fact, I was starving; it had taken Pop
about ﬁfteen or twenty minutes) but
where to eat? Holden's is a market, not
a restaurant; We had to find someplace to
go.
So we went down the street to wait for
a bus. The ﬁrst bus that passed was a
Wellington Express. I‘ve got to figure
how the buses run someday. '

This was one of the better eating
experiences We had in Albany, bccauscl
atc in my suite. We got there at 5:00, and
sat to watch the Odd Couple while we ate.

The sub was a little shorter than most
of the torpedoes I‘ve had this year; it was
auout 9 1/2 or IO inches. My sub was
pretty thick (Mark said his wasn't——I
guess he got the one with only four slices
of turkey). It had a lot of cheese, a liberal
dose of mayonnaise, and a ton of onions
(I can still taste them).

Holden‘s Market is a fun experience.
The store is kind ofa throwback to the
general store (their ice pops are still 5
cents). l’op's sub isa good one. l‘m gonna
give ‘cm a 7.5. for the submarine and the
market.

By this time. I guess I've sort of
resigned myself to a life oftypical Albany
subs. This way I‘m rarely disappointed
(there are some exceptions) and rarely
excited. I‘ still looking for that special,
pcrl'cct sun wich. Any suggestions?
