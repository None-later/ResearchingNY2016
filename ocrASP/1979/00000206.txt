With regard to Gary Schatsky's letter of
I arch 20, he stated “it was clearly presented
hat the speaker would come for free." This is
only according to Gary Schatsky; some of the
acts are still in the process of veriﬁcation by
.peakers Forum. We are appauled by his
nelhieal tactics and his failure to approach
peakera Forum for information.

We appreciate those members of Central
ouncil that reafﬁrmed Speakers Forum
osition as the major booking group for
peakers. We encourage new members to
ltend our meetings, Monday nights at 8:30in

We would like to take this opportunity to
tell members of the student body about an
important event that is taking place at the
Stutc University l’lttzu next week. On
'l‘ucsduy, April 3rd. students from around the
state will be coming to Albany to protest the
Sltttc University's involvement in the
upttrthcid regime in South Africa. As most
know ttlrendy. the State University had
investments totalling over seven million
dollars in corporations that do business with
the apartheid regime; with their military
weapons, technical ttssistuncc ttnd
discriminatory hiring policies lhcsc
corporations provide the means by which the
racist government in South Africa cuu
lllltltllltlll its system of oppression. South
Africtt is unique in the world todttyin hcingtltc
nniy tuition llutl not only discriminates. but
lcgitimitcs this discrimination by
incorporating separation of the races into its
constitution ttnd legrtl system.

On Murch llllh rttthc Statewide Conference
on Apartheid ttnd Divestment. students froth
around the stttlc met to consider wlutt actions
could he tttkctl ill the SliNY-widc level to

force the University to divest its holdings in .

South Africa. The students at the conference.
coming from eight SUNY schools across the
stltlc. decided that the best menus we could
express our outrage ut the University's
complicity with itpitrlhcid is to bring our case

't‘cs down on Stttlc Ht. tutti

‘that this letter helps to point out to the writer
of the cited personal that the attitudes behind
such a “joke” are basically anti-woman and
anti-choice. 1 hope that he/ she will reconsider
their "joke" and realize the consequences of
such lrivializationi.

To the Editor:

l am writing this letter to clarify a very
serious situation. In your Tuesday April 27
issue. i was quoted. or shall l say misquotcd in
an article labeled "racism". Not only was i
misquoted, but i was quoted out ofcontext. it
may appear to anyone who would read this
story that I am complaining and attacking
Coach Ford and his staff. What has occurred
here is that particulars about my football
career have labeled as racism. WRONG!

First ofall, l object to having my name used
as a person who is “lodging complaints of
racism against Coach Robert Ford.“ 1 am not
fodging those complaints. Secondly, this
article makes it appear as though Brad
Aldrich and l are at odds. Wrong again.
Tltirdly, in readinglhcarticlc sltttingthut lam
the perfect athlete, i must disagree and admit.
we all have our faults.

Never have i called Coach Ford a racist. nor
do I think he is it racist. i do believe he has
certain problems in communicating with
many of the athletes. ttnd this is it problem of
which he is ttwurc.

My cttsc has been abused ttnd portrayed as it
pcrsonztldislike bclwccn Ford. Molttt.ttnd the
program. For the record. Couch Ford is it
person whom i respect. Although I may
distttttcc with him lli times. I think highly of
him its it man ttnd ll fricnd. Mike Mollu is it
person that I consider to be it lricntl ttnd never
would i milltt: u statement which would

Regaining A Mutual TruSt

The arrest of two Albany Police Ofﬁcers on Wednesday in Waterbury

Hall poses many questions concerning not only the basic rights of youth

as citizens of the U.S.A., but also some very grave questions concerning

the safety of SUNYA students, in light of the all too apparent

indications that as students, we are not viewed by many police officers in

an objective manner, and besides being harrassed, we may not be getting

the protection we are entitled to. '

The police exist, as we have been told, to protect the citizens of an area

from crime. This is such a basic and immutable tenet, that it seems
ridiculous to have to state. Unfortunately, though, it appears that this
i principle has been ignored by some ofﬁcers of the law, who, because of
their actions, the actions of what we hope is small minority, have
. ruptured the trust we have been taught to have in policemen from the
day we were old enough to discern them.

The result is a situation that is dangerous and unhealthy: The students
will lose their faith in the law, there is no more trust, or reliance on
police. Instead, students may feel that they have nowhere to turn, and
take the law into their own hands, something that may result in violence,
indirectly causing a new crime to occcur.

The arrest of the two officers, along with the frightening incident that
a SUNYA student had whilejogging early one morning, may, because of
their coincidental timing, have a great effect on the attitudes that will
form in the minds of students.

It is to be expected that students may now be fearful of the law, and
seek to avoid them as a source of help, viewing them rather as an enemy
of sorts; an opposition. And if a poor relationship between police
officers and students is allowed to continue. then who knows what dtrc
happenings may occur as a result of this.

Therefore, it is imperative that the many honest, caring and devoted
officers of the law make a conscrted effort to restore the faith that,
through their diligence and horror, they well deserve.

The law is on our side. and despite some indications to the contrary,
we advise all students to not have an undue prejudice against the officers
of the low. most of whom do have our best interests in mind.

And it is our hope that both the Albany Police Officers and University
Police Officers will be quite understanding of the hesitency oftrust that
many students will feel when a situation arises in which themselves and
police are involved, and will tolerate it.

It is unfortunate thutjust and fair police officers may have to suffer for
the injustices committed by unjust and corrupt ones. But please
understand. officers, that we have suffered as well.
