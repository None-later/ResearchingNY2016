History hardly stops. Disco In the ‘10s
Is In revolt against rock In the '60s. It Is
the antithesis of the "natural" look.
the real feelings. the seriousness, the
' ' , stru glee. the
sincerity. pretensions. an pain olthe
last generation. Disco is "unreal"
artificial. and exaggerated. Itsfflrms
fantasies. fashions. gossip. frivollty.
and fun of an evasive era. The ‘80s
were braless. lumpy. heavy, rough,
and romantic; disco ls stylish. sleek,
smooth, contrived, and controlled.
Disco places surface over substance.
mood over meaning. action over
thought. The '60s were a mind trip
(mari)uana, acid): Disco is abody trip
(quaiudes. cocaine). The '605 were
cheap; disco is expensive. On a ‘60s
trip. you saw God In a grain of sand;
on a disco trip. you see Jackie O. at
Studio 54.
