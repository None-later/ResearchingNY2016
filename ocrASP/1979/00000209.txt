The season is just about two
months old and it seems that the
Albany State volleyball squad is
finally getting into high gear.

Coming off' avbig win over
Rochester last weekend the Spikcrs
swept past both the United Stated
Merchant Marine Academy (MMA)
and Queens College on Wednesday
evening.

The two victories raised their
overall record to ll-B. thus assuring
them of a winning season.

The Danes came out ﬁring against

USSMAI jumping to an 8-1 lead.
and went on to 'win 15-5. Their
foremost objective was to keep the
ball away from Gary Wanzok who is
the biggest hitter on USMMA.

Couch Tcd Earl explains.
“Against USMMA if you keep the
ball away from Gary and work on
their weaker players you‘ll be okay."

The squad has scrimmugcd
against Mohawk Valley,

lrrrs come away without a victory.
Albany played Well against powerful
Springﬁeld. but lost 10-9. and then
in a rematch, were soundly beaten
l4-5. Against Middtcbury. the.
Danes again performed well enough
to win. but were defeated 14-9. “Of
all the serimmagcs. l was most
pleased with our game against
Midtllcbury." said Motta. “We
played with rt number of injuries.
and we Were down quite a few
people.“

:‘I expected that we would look a
little stronger." said Schmohl. "But

'by taking game number two 15-13.

The Spikcrs ware down 8-1 early
in the game before Earl called a time
out to make some changes. The
adjustments worked as Albany
fought back to make the game close.

“We played reasonably well with
the team we had in. A couple of
missed serves hurt us." remarked
Earl on his squad's only loss of the

night:-

The Danes began to bear down
again in the third game. staking
themselves to a 14-8 lead. At this
point. as Earl put it. "we blcw our
concentration.“ which allowad
USMMA to knotthcscorc at l4-l4.

Albany‘s Spikcrs then regained
their intensity and won the last two
points convincingly to win the
match.

The Great Danes took two easy
games from a severely outmanncd

Queens squad. Albany won both ‘

ltundily 15-2, 15-9. Queens played
with only six men (no subs). two of

whom were very inexperienced.

“We just outplayed them: we are
on a higher talent level than they
were." Earl said. ‘ . -

Earl was impressed with the
hitting of his sophomore Gary
Becker and senior Kirk Andrews
along with the setting of Jan Show
and Rob Harrington.

Albany was without Howie
Nuisinov. Gcnc' Sosiak, and Jay
Cusik for Wednesday's matches.
Nuisinov and Sosisk are battling the

flu.

The Spikch will take to the road
again this weekend to face the
University of Rochester in a rematch
of last weekend‘s three hour battle. A
win would put the Danes at 2-1 in
their loop, with only a make-up
match with Cornell remaining.

If a mutually agreeable site and
date cannot be found for the Cornell
match, Albany would receive the win
by forfeit. Earl is “desperately
trying“ to find an available date to
face the Big Red before the EVCL
playoffs begin in mid-April.

we were playing good schools. and
they each had more practice than we
did."

Dcnicd a spring trip because of the
vacation schedule. the Danes could,
be somewhat behind some schools in
practice time. “Without the trip. we
are kind of hurt as far as total tcam
unity and the fact that we did not get
to play a great deal against good
competition." Mottn explained.

The Dancs' lit-game schedule is

almost an exact duplicate of last
season’s. but Mottn expects a few
teams to be stronger. “We don't have
a break until April 18th (Potsdam),
and that's the only break 1 scc.”suid
Motta. “Except for Potsdam. all the
SUNY teams are strong. The only
cnti-hrcutltcrs i see are Hunwlck.

Only two breaths of air; the rest are
torrglt for us."

Besides Cortland, who Mottu feels
are “head rrrrd shoulders above our
level of competition." the rest of the

lhe Blades will hold a slight

all masters of the draw. The Cheap

Springer in net will be key to their
chances of winning the coveted

limited number ofspcctrrtors will be
permitted.

Confidence

schedule is demanding, but not
impossible. The stiffcst tests should
come from Gcncsco. Brockpon. and
perennial NCAA playoff bound
New Haven. One advantage the
Danes may have early in the season
is that their first three opponents
(Oswcgo. Rl'l, RlT) are all playing
their ﬁrst games of the season when
they play Albany.

“This is probably one of the best
teams I've played on in my four
years." said Dinct. “We have a lot of
potential. and We are 100 percent
better than last year. i seriously
think that we can win cycry game
except the Cortland game."

"We here a shot at winning every
game we play in." added Schmohl.
“Cortland is a little above us. but we
have the ability to stay in every
game. With the talent we have. we
have a good shot at beating most
teams."

'l‘ornorrow will be the Danes“ first
test.
