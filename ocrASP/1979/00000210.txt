Ohio State Favored In First TitlevMeet

Ever Contested At The University Pool

by David Osborn

The Ohio State women's
synchronized swimming team was
practicing in the University Pool
yesterday morning and drawing a
ﬁne reaction from the small crowd
that watched. ln their black and red
one piece suits. the Buckeyes
performed a varied set of routines in
perfect synch. One observer
ventured a comparison.

“They don‘t miss one beat down
there." she said. “They look almost
like ballet robots in the water.“

As robots go. the Buckeyes may
fall short. but they are clearly
favorites in the AlAW national
championships being conducted
here today and tomorrow.
Preliminaries are scheduled all day
Friday and ﬁnals will be held before
an expected packed house
tomorrow night beginningat7:30. A
small charge will be levied to view
the ﬁnals on video-circuit television
in the Dance Studio ifthe pool seats
have been ﬁlled.

A large local gathering grouped
with the University‘s attendanceand
a sprinkling of coaches and
observers from the entire realm of
the sport should make the meet a
spectacle of sorts in addition to a
gate success.

This event is the ﬁrst ofﬁcially
sanctioned title meet on the

Balance Gives Lacrosse. Team

by Paul Schwart:

Last year, it was more of an
individual effort, with two players
contributing a disproportionate
amount to the team's success. This
year. things are different. For the
Albany State lacrosse team to have a
successful season. which opens
tomorrow when the Danes host
Oswego at 1:00, there must be a
balanced team effort.

“We're a little bit more balanced
this year." said Albany lacrosse
coach Mike Motta, “both
offensively and defensively. last
season defensively we relied pretty
much on Gary Miller. and he did a
goodjob in the goal. Offensively. we
relied on Dan Goggin to throw the
goalsin. This year We camein without
either of those two. so we have to rely
on everybody.“ .

Miller was the starting goaltender
on last year's squad, but did not
return to school this year. Goggin. a
scoring-machine who broke the
Albany record for goals in a season.
graduated. Ten returning lettermen
are on hand this spring from last
year‘s 5-7 team that lost their ﬁrst
five games. but then regrouped to
win five oftheir next seven contests.

The player who will be looked
upon to fill the scoring gap left by
Goggin is senior co—captnin Bill
Schmohl. As the highest returning
scorer for the Danes (ll goals. lb
assists. 27 points). Schmohl will lead
an inexperienced group of
attnckmen. and will play a vital role
in Albany's offensive game-plan.

collegiate level. Ohio St. took the
two previous. championships in
unofﬁcial competitions. The meet will
also mark the ﬁrst time Albany State
will host a national championships
of any sort. Thirteen schools are
competing comprising a list of I96
competitors.

“This is our ﬁrst opportunity to
host a national championship and it
has to do great things for your
reputation." said Albany Athletic
Director Bob Ford. "Synchronized
swimming has been a very solid
program for us athletically since its
inception. Something like this will
only help them go further and its got
to help with recruiting.“

Cygnet coach Pat Rogers put in a
bid to host the nationals early last
year and told by the National
Coaches Academy that she had been
granted the I980 meet. When
Arizona. the original site for I979.
balked due to a lack of support
personnel. Rogers was asked if she
would switch with Arizona and
she agreed. That was back in
September.

“After that 1 had to get ofﬁcial
permission from the AlAW. send
out entry applications and organize
lthe meet to the last detail; we’ve
hosted the Regionals six times so it's
not totally new." Rogers said. “This
is a strong ﬁeld and I think Ohio St..

as stability in attack and scoring,"
said Motta. “He has played lacrosse
for eight years. he handles the stick
excellently with both hands. and the
players look up to him."

“l‘m not really so much a scorer."
explained Schmohl. “l‘m thereto get
things going. With our team this
year. it isn't going to be one guy."

Around Schmohl are players with
a limited amount of experience on
the collegiate level. Sophomore
John Nelson was on the squad last
year. and has played well in the pre-
season. The surprise on the team so
far is Dave Benedetto. who. as a
freshman. has played his way into a

foes to date. including schools that

squad that placed ﬁrst at Villanova

“We ltave a good chance of
placing in the ﬁnals of the team and
trio competitions." Rogers
explained. “Last year we were way
out oi it in overall team points but
this year I feel we could reach sixth
place. We have no chance of going
any higher. but after the top three._
Bowling Green and Wisconsin-
Madison. we may nudge in there.”

The Albany trio. which Rogers
feels has a shot. consists of Nancy
Glaslow. Mandy Maney and Cathy
Lotito. Points counting toward the
team title are awarded more for the
trio and team competitions so the
Cygnets are hoping for strong
showings in those categories to offest
the expected trouncing in the solo
and duets.

"After winning the eastern title we '

had a letdown and last Thmday and
Friday were really the pits in
practice. " said'Sue Goodman. an

starting slot at attack.

Two other newcomers should also
see playing time. Mark Waterstram.

had “a good. solid preseason — he‘s
a good feeder and can. handle the
stick." according to Motta.As a
transfer from Binghamton. Scott
Cort has in Motta‘s words. had “an

The midfielder position will be
restructured a bit with the addition
of a rule change. in the past. after a
goal was scored. the ball would come
out to mid-ﬁeld for a center face-off.
The new rule states that after a goal.

we‘ve regained Our incentive now
and I don‘t think we can be

now."

Ohio St. will enter two squads in,

the full-time bracket and they could
wind up ﬁnishing ﬁrst and second to
key the expected Buckeye victory.

They'also have enough top-quality
swimmers to pile up points in the
other sections. Michigan. Arizona
and the Buckeyes have been
competing against each other all

team that has been scored on. This
will increase the need for more
specialized midﬁelders. for a team
will now know when they will be on
offense or defense.

The ﬁrst midﬁeld line willagain be
spearheaded by senior Rich
Heimerle. last year‘s groundball
leader. Heimerle suffered bruised
ribs and an enlarged spleen in the
Middlebury scrimmage. but Motta
feels he “should be ready to go on
Saturday against Oswego." Other
starters on the line are Dana Dervay
and Pete Weycamp. who played
lacrosse for Albany as a freshman,

Other midﬁelders who ﬁgure to
see a substantial amount of playing
time are Mike Slocum. who tallied
eight goals and two assists last year,
junior Ken Gorman.Doug Dowd
Jan Sniffen. and freshman Glen
Margrave. “We must have solid
from all the
midfielders," said Motta. “because
they are all going to be playing about
equally.“

0n defense. the Danes will again
look to co-captain Mike Dinet. a
four-year starter for Albany. to play
a key role. Dinet has been slowed
somewhat with ankle problems. but
is‘ expected to be in the starting
lineup‘ tomorrow. “We're counting
on Mike.“ Motta said. “He should
have a ﬁne year."

Expected to start alongside Dinet
was Greg Curran. but a broken hand

, had sidelined him. Tom Scarpinato.

a specialist in defense around the
goal crease. will start with Dinet, and
the third defenseman will be Tom
Gallagher. a freshman recruit from
New Hyde Park, who was impressive
enough in practice to nail down a
starting assignment. Motta‘s one
concern on defense is the possible
lack of depth.

The largest question mark is at
goaltender. With Miller gone. the
duties in the nets will be ﬁlled by
sophomore Ken Tirman. who is
starting for the first time for Albany.
“So far. Ken has looked pretty
good." said Motta. "He ital up days
