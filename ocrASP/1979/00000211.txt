Pass/Fail OptiOn Extended
Again And Again And Aga'

In

 

by M..I. Madmen

The University Academic Council
(UAC) reversed itself yesterday and
passed a resolution extending the
pass-full grading option to the

' scmeter‘s ﬁnal wcckahc resolution,

resolution. introduced by
mathematics pron. Malcolm
Sherman. passed the UACw only
one negative vote. that of Senator
Mark Borkowski. »
Only two weeks ago. the UAC
passed a resolution extending the

- dctldlinc from the second to the

fourth week of the semester. in
introducing yesterday's resolution.
Shcrmun said he “felt it wtts timc tllc
students were allowed to use the
pass-fail deadline to their own
advantage."

“Too often students are forced to
accept it C grtldc which could look
bud‘ on their law school

Pleased With One Jerk Saying No
Borkowski's A'Nerd
Students Use ‘Wisely

 

applications." Sherman said. “I
ﬁrmly believe that this situation has
to be corrected. How can a student
be expected to earn over 570.000 :1
year if he isn't practicing law." '

Sherman said alter the UAS
meeting that he felt potential
medical school studcnts wcrc also
"being victimized by tltc C
sttuatlon.“

In it hcutcd cxcltungc witll
Shcrmzln during discussion oi' the
measure. Borkowski cullcd tiny
student who would take at puss-fail
course “nothing but u shifllcss no-
good lncntul midget."

“The major question hcrc is
whcthcr we‘re running it university
or .tl day-care ccntcr." liorkowski
.su id. “'l‘llcrc's no wty it sludcnt in u
puss-fail coursc is going to work us
htlrd or learn as much us our: in no A-
E course. It‘s purc itlttl silnplc logic."

ASU To Start Saving Up The Gas

 

Students Use Footsies For Energy

by M.J. Madman

Once the tuition hike question is
settled. the Albany Student Union
(ASU) will devote its energy to
promoting more efﬁcient gasoline
consumption in the Albany area.
according to ASU coordinator
Bruce Cronin.

“We feel this is it natural step in
our progress towards becoming a
vital force in the capitol area."
Cronin said. “After all. what could be
more imponant in this day and age
than saving gus’? Everybody knows
thosc Arabs have got us in a corner
wc cnn‘t get out of."

Cronin said the group's ﬁrst
project will be a “walk to school"
climpaign. “if we could get 1500
pcopic to walk all the way to
downtown Albany, we can certainly
get the majority of students to walk
to school.“ he said.

To achieve this goal. Cronin suid

ASU nus souctted the help ot’tnc
SUNYA . Plant Department.
"They've agreed to stop picking up
students in those green buses." hc
suid. lnstcud Cronin said. only those
students with physical handicaps
will be provided with transportation
to and from school.

“Everybody else will have to ﬁnd
their own way to get uptown."
Cronin staid. "and to combat those
who might try hitchhiking we've
instituted lt massive advertising
campaign on the dangers of picking
someone up."

ASU is currently working on a
plan to sabotage personal cars that
students living off campus own to
further increase the likelihood of
their walking. according to
Chairperson Nancy Smyth.

“it's going to take some time to
come up with a plan though.“ Smyth
said. “we have to check out all the

legalities with SA lawyer Jack
Lcatcr.

Once the “walk to school"
program is intnot'ion.-ASU hopes to

him all motor vehicle trafﬁc from the .

SUN VA campus. Cronin said.

“We’ll probably start out by
putting in more of those speed
bumps. possibly about one every 50
feet on Perimeter Road. That should
begin to discourage people from
bringing their cars on campus."
Cronin said.

He went on to say that signs will he
posted at all entrances to the
university wurning drivers that
parking is restricted only to those
with blue stickch that ASU will
distribute. Erich sticker will cost
$500 ll semester. Cronin said.

"The combination of the bumps
and lllc stickers should ward offjust
about all the potential drivers."
