Funds for the building of the

Reilly said that since “a good

to support any measure which might

“Not only would we be saving gas

President Vincent O'Leary‘s
approval of both gas-saving plans.

“Once we pointed out to O'Leary
that not only would gasoline be
saved. but that the cost of
maintaining those buses would be
eliminated. he threw his whole-
hearted support behind the cause."
Cronin said.

O‘Leary also felt the elimination
of trafﬁc on Perimeter Road would
end the rash of minor accidents
SUNYA has experienced recently.
Cronin said.

Smyth said that ASU had
considered the problem ofthe speed
bumps possibly hampering ﬁre
trucks in case of an emergency. but
that "the positive aspect of cutting
gas consumption outweiahed the
possible ﬁre problems."

"Besides." said Cronin. “concrete

O‘Leary said he would approve the
resolution should it be passed by the
Senate.

“It's a change which has been
needed for a long time," O‘beary
said. “1 don't think l'd be where 1 am
today if i hadn‘t done some careful
dropping. adding and grade
manipulating."

O'Leary said he met with both
Sherman and Borkowski on the
pass-fail issue and that their
discussions were "enlightening."

“i never realizedjust how much of
a nerd Borkowski is before."

O'Leary said. "He kept tryint to push
the discussion along'so he could 'get
to the library to study. I'm sure glad
my son isn't like that.”

Borkowski was unavailable for

comment last night. as one of his "

Suitemates said he was “cramming
hard for an Eco l8] test."

Sherman said the talk with
O‘Leary was “fruitful and very
spirited.“

“The President agreed with me
whole-heartedly that the C situation

dark to long." Sherman said.

Sttuers will try to make the Garden

We thought he was kidding. Finally
after about l5 minutes of trying to
calm him down. he bolted for the
door and that's the last we've seen of
him."

it looks as though Alutnni ltas
seen the last of Potter (‘lub also. An
attentpt to get an off-campus frat
house was blocked by Albany‘s strict
zoning regulations. Sojusl when all
seetned lost. a letter arrived from the
governor‘s office.

“it seems.” says Williamson. "that
Hugh Carey has a good friend who
was a Potter man in the fifties and he
mentioned our problem to the
Governor. He sent us an invitation
to move into the Hat ﬂoor of the
tower down on the South Mall

[Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State
Plaza]. He said it has been empty for
a while and that we could probably
put it to ‘good‘ use. i think he wants
to be invited to our parties."

. "Maybe." added Duffy. “he wants
to get the students offhis back about
tlte tuition hike. sort of a peace
offering. I'll tell ya. he's ().K. in my
book. He didn't even set quiet
hours!"

Since the arrival ofthe fitted letter.
l’otter members have been busy
removing their wood panelling and
carting it down to the Plaza. It also
seems that dozens of people are
looking to pledge. “Even some
Alumni girls are saying hello.“ said
one member. it seems Albany has yet
to see the last of Potter Club!
