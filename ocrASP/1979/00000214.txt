Movies: They weren’t

 

w,» , I»

what

   

Last Friday evening I waa faced with the
choice of watching the ﬁghts. or a movie
called The Wizard of 02 on telthsion. I
decided to try tltis picture. What a mistake.

Firstly the stoi y of the movie is so silly that
it borders on fantasy. lt‘s the story ofa girl
who gets caught up in a tornado and lands on
some planet or something (the director never
makes this clear). All that we know isthat this
place is “over the rainbow."Tlte flic continues
with the heroine. Dorothy. trying to get home.
Obviously the director was trying tocapitalize
on both the Star Wars genre and disaster

ﬁlms. How trite.

Technically the ﬁlm is a joke. Continuity
was severely lacking. For example the movie
starts out in black and white and then
suddenly turns to color. What happened? Did
the director get a larger budget after shooting
the ﬁrst half hour? What can I say about the
scenery? Obviously he didn't bother to shoot
or. location —— that was quite obvious as one
.I-uld easily see backdrops used for most

SCENES.

The casting was also a disaster. First ofall.

many of 'he actors played dual role

  

     

They Are Now

much more could it have cost to get ﬁve or six
more actors? Cheaprtess shows! Furthermore.
one role called fora lion and instead of usinga
real one they used a man in a lion suit. Born
Free this wasn‘t. The director also tried to
cash in on occultism by making two of the
characters witches. Rosemaryis Baby did it
much better several years ago.

The special effects were awful. At one point
we even get to see how the character of the
wirard was controlled when Toto pulled back
the curtain. How that shot got left in remains
to be seen. The director‘s lack of originality
was obvious in several scenes. The inhabitants
of 07. were midgets called Munt'hkins which
we all know are a trademark of Dunkin
Donuts.

Finally there's the copout of an ending
where the director tries to confuse us by
leading us to believe that Dorothy‘s trip was
all a dream. lfit wasa supposed to beadream.
then how come we saw her house get scooped
up in the tornado?

Finally 1 was appalled by the racial
innuendo of the script with lines like “I do
believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks."Alll
" I should have watched the fights.

 

 

    
      

 

‘ Masthead
Madness

To the Editor:
What's the matter with you guys? It seems

to me that whoever does your layout is either
severely schizophrenic or suffers from a lack
of object constancy.

In my forty years of teaching. never have]
seen such a blatant disregard for the bane
principles of design. Week after week l look
for copies of the ASP in the Campus Center
but am unable to accurately identify them
sincethe Masthead never appears in the same
place twice. This is very perturbing since 1
enjoy reading the personals so much and
Universin News doesn‘t have any. On many
an occasion We missed them too.

Please. for my beneﬁt and the beneﬁt of
your 9.000 loyal readers. keep the Masthead
in the same place. Next thing you know it will
be in a vertical position from the top of the
page looking like the Peking Daily Press.

On behalf of the funloving people on Dutch

those responsible for that great food ﬁght two
weeks ago.

Yeah it was inconsiderate. Yeah it was
childish. Yeah it was uncivilized. but lord it
was a pisser. ldon't think I‘ve seen that much
lettuce in my life not to mention that it was all
airborne. What a show! That flying yogurt
was the best thing since the roman candle.

it‘s already common knowledge that you
guys aren‘t from Dutch Quad (but anyone
could know that). lt was so impeccably
planned and executed I thought it was the
CIA at first. Youjust don‘t know what it did
for me to see it.

You‘ve made my last three and a half years

To the Editor:

As an average kind of college gity l‘d like to
express my opinion aboitt the girls on the

They think the world revolves around them.
They don't put out. ’l‘ltcy get you goin' and

 

 

leave you linngiti'.

The skinny ones are always on diets and the
fat ones are always eating. It should be the
other way around. And at least once a month
you can‘t talk to them. That brings us to sex,
it's their favorite excuse. Unless they're drunk.
then you ﬁnd a surprise. Bummer, man. whvid
they waste my time. '

And once you get 'em in bed you‘re still not
guaranteed of a good thing. God forbid they
should lower themselves and show you they‘re
enjoying it.

Students To Study Abroad In China

 

First In SUNY System

by Debby Smith

Three SUNYA students have been
accepted in an exchange program to
the Peoples Republic of China
(PRC). and will be the ﬁrst students
in_the SUNY system to attend a
university in Peking.

Chinese Deputy Minister of
Education in Peking. Chi Li gave
special permission for SUNYA
students to go to Peking in August
I979 according to a lecturer in the

The three students selected have
wonderful personalities and very
good relationships with other
students studying Chinese. so they
can adjust easier to living in the
environment of China.“ Chen said.
They‘ve been eating Chinese food.“
Chen added.

“The program. as far as l
understand it. is that we go over and
enroll in a language center for
training to bring our language up to
university level. which will ttikc
anywhere up to three months,“

Pemble said.

Pemble said that after the students
complete their language training
they will enroll in Peking University.
where they will have a choice of a
cirriculum in literature. history or
political science.

“Diplomatic relations have
everything to do with the exchange.
Students would not have been able
to get visas (previously). and the
university students would not have
been met with enthusiasm. The good

normalization. students would have
had to be on guard." said Chen.

resulted in an exchange of between

Proposal ToExtend Deadline

by Pat Francomnno

The Undergraduate Academic
Council‘s (UAC) proposal to extend
the S/U (pass-fail) grading option
period two weeks passed with only
three opposing votes at yesterday‘s
University Senate meeting. Students
will now be able to make the SN
grading selection up until two weeks
after the last day to add a course.

UAC chair Professor Harold
Cannon introduced the bill and said.
“The existing proposal indicates a

option." He added that “with this
type of option there would be
encouragement to take courses
outside one‘s ﬁeld of interest."

One Senate member expressed
concern that this proposal might put
pressure on faculty to give an
evaluation prior to this deadline.
Cannon responded by saying that he
wanted it known that neither “in
UAC nor the Senate is there any
implication that faculty are being
requested to give any kind of
evaluation during this period."

SCUE To Submit Proposal

I‘ltulo: Kit/I/i'rlti‘rg

For Pilot Academic Progam

by Charles Bell

The Special Cotnmittee for Un-
dergraduate Education (SCU E) will
submit to the University Academic
(‘ommittcc later this month a
proposal for it pilot academic
program in 300 SUNYA un-
dergritduutes.

The pilot progrttm bill is the prac-
tical portion ofaset of proposals for
itnproving undergraduate educa-
tion. SCU E‘s proposals come at the
end of eight months of study by the
committee‘s student and faculty
members.

Committee member Richard
Collier said that the pilot program. if

 

.-,..are‘~”‘t==;,

 

 

   

approved. will seek out 300 in-
coming freshman to voluntarily par-
ticipate iii the project starting in Fall
of I980.

Collier said that each par-
ticipating student will enroll in four

credit courses each semester. choos—

ing courses from six broad
categories which bridge SUNYA‘s
current disciplines.

“The new disciplines will be
broader than the ones we are dealing
with now." said committee member
Lisa Newmark. “We are intentional.
ly avoiding structuring the pilot
along the current lines to avoid the
stigmos attached to them.” ,

Newmark said that some of the '

pilot program's curriculum areas
will be j"approacbea to social
science. a study of various world
cultures, and developing analytical
and uuantitntive skills.

Collier said that the SCUE com-
mittee members hope that the pilot
program will improve the un-
dergraduate education for the par-
ticipating students.

The pilot will aim at small-sized
classes of about thirty students in

compromise between many ﬁelds."
Borkowski said that there were
three factions involved in the
compromise. One extreme wanted
the S/U deadline the same as the
drop deadline. The middle faction
maintained that there should be an
extension but it should not be used
to duck had grades. The other
extreme wanted no change at all.
Borkowski. in supplying a
rationale for the bill said. “What

The proposal passed UAC several
weeks ago but had to be approved by
the full Senate.

Student
proposed a resolution that the
Senate recotnmend that the faculty
vote to nmmend the Senate bylaws
to allow continuous
representation on the Senate. The
recommendation was passed after
twenty tninutes of discussion. The
faculty will vote to approve this
recommendation at their May 3

meeting.

students to “beg every two years for
continued representation."

Hill said that the proposal was
recommended because “students are
attending meetings. they are
responsible and are an intricate part
of this body." Hill said there was no
intent to take away the Senate‘s
power to question or eliminate
student representation.

Professor Charles Tarlton
questioned why the Senate had no
provisions for permanent student
representation since the students
were part of the University.

Senate chair Francine Frank
:xplained that the Senate was
originally at creation of the faculty
rod that student representation was
aided only on it provisional basis.
She also said that regardless of
whether or not there were student
stntitors. students would still be able
to serve on committees.

Student senator Bruce Cronin
said "The reason for having students
in lllL‘ sctintc itself is tlitit it‘s the only
inpitt students ctiti have ill u lot of
university decisions."

Professor Shane said he objected
to the proposal because it would

Firetrucks from the Albany Fire Department will be responding to
fire alarms pulled on campus if a new alarm procedure gets final
approval. according to Campus Safety Director Karl Scharl.

The new procedure will provide for response by both SUNYA
Public Safety personnel and the Albany Fire Dept. Currently. the ﬁre
department responds to campus only if called in by SUNYA
personnel. Scharl said that the new procedure was requested by
Albany Fire Department Chief Fitzmaurice. who was concerned
about the department‘s response time to campus. The purpose ofthe
plan is to have the fire department arrive at the scene as soon as
possible after an alarm is pulled.
