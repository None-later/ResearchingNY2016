normalization. announced its
intention of sending large numbers
of students to the U.S. to make up
for years of neglect. Chinese scholars
will be in the age range of 35-40 years
old." Associate Vice Chancellor of
international Programs of SUNY
central Charles Neff said.

'ihe Chinese will be sending more
students to the U.S. thanthe number
of Americans visiting the PRC
because the Chinese feel that there is
a need to send people to the U.S. to
improve scientiﬁc knowledge to aid
the process of modernization. The
state of Chinese science is such that.
except in particular fields.
Americans feel they cotild better

 

according to Halsey Beerner. staff
officer on the U.S. Committee on
Scholarly Communications with the
PRC.

Conditions in China are rustic by
American standards. according to
Pcmble. “Everything we consider a
necessity is luxury over there. l'm
nervous about going. "ﬁrings that i
take for granted they don‘t haVe.
There are communal showers and no
ﬂush toilets.“ Pemblc said.

“There‘s a rigorous schedule
which they keep to." Pcmble added.
“Students are up and doingexerciscs
at (i am. Classes are from 7:30 a.m.
lo ll:](la.m..with a break until 2:30
p.111. Classes resume from 2:30 pm.
to 5:30 pm. and there are classes six
days a week."

The three students will leave in
late August. and wiilhavetwo weeks
to settle down before classes start in

 

September. and are thinking of
spending a few days in Hong Kong
before going to Peking by rail. Costs
are being looked into, and the
vaccination process will start soon,
according to Silverberg.

SUNYA is seeking to achieve a
formal exchange program with the
PRC. One of the major problems is
the disparity ofcost between Chinese
universities, which cost less than
$100 a year. and that of American
universities. according to Assistant
Vice President for Academic Affairs
Dr. Helen Desfosscs.

“The living costs are different.
Generally speaking. the prices in
China are lower than in this
country." iiu said.

“The situation is that the cost of
education is not the same. but both
sides have agreed to pay the expenses

said.  - s a.

in November of this year, the
National Science Foundation. the
chief aim of the U.S. government
that oversees scientific research
going on in academic fields.
negotiated with the Chinese Science
and Technical Association for a
formal exchange program.
according to Beemer.

The exchange program was
confirmed in the agreement
President Caner and Vice Premier
of the PRC Deng-Xiao Ping signed
in January.

The Committee on Scholarly
Communications with the PRC is in
charge of the selection process.
There are twa exchange programs;
and advanced training program with
the basic requirements ofthree years
of Chinese. and a research program.
To participate in the research

Nanidng. V ~‘

New Paltz and other SUNY
campuses are arranging for
exchanges. SUNY at Stonybroo‘k
has an agreement with the University
of Fudan in Shanghi, and is sending
six students. One SUNY at Buffalo
student is scheduled to go to China,
according to Neff.

SUNY Chancellor Clifton R.
Wharton said he was extended an
invitation to visit China by ths
National Academy in China. anf
may visit next fall.

Chinese Studies exists at SUNYA
as an interdisciplinary major,
though efforts are being made to
make it an ofﬁcial major. The
University Senate approved the
proposal for the Chinese Studies
major in November. and President
()‘Leary signed the senate bill. ths
