COLLEGE TRENDS

Students going to college today
may not have as much fun as
students did a decade ago. but they
may be better educated.

Harvard College Dean Henry
Rosovsky says there is a trend now
‘among colleges and universities to
go back to the basics in curriculum
subjects.

Rosovsky, who was the driving
force behind the reform at Harvard,

'says that social relevance courses

such as the History of Black Jazz and
the Social Importance of Comic
Books are “out.” Basic English

Languages are back “in.”

Rosovsky says the tightening of
academic standards has resulted
because educators and parents are

appalled at the erosion of the basic

three "R's" among students.

BIOFEEDBACK

Biofeedback is apparently
becoming legitimate, at least with
one Los Angeles doctor.

Doctor Melvin Werbach says that
in recent years he has treated more
than two patients with biofeedback
techniques.

Werbach says that he has used
biofeedback successfully to treat
patients suffering from pain due to
migraine headaches. arthritis,
hypertension, stomach disorders.
and back aches.

Werbach reports that once
patients are hooked up to a
biofeedback machine which
monitors changes in skin
temperature and muscle tension.
they can, by sheer concentration.
relax and improve the blood supply
to their bodies. which eases their
pain.

MARKETREE

Now that humans have‘

domesticated such things as cattle
and pigs. Michigan State University
scientists are talking about
domesticating trees.

Under a grant from the US
Department of Energy. the
Michigan researchers are looking
into the possibility of breeding trees,
for everything from fuel to human
food.

James Hanover of the Michigan
State University Forestry
Department says that certain trees
have already been domesticated to
the point where they grow 10 times
faster than normal trees in the forest.
He suggests that fast-growing tree

BEST DIE YOUNG? ‘

Billy Joel is not the most popular
singer at New Jersey‘s Seaton Hall
University.

In fact. Joel's song.~ “Only {The ‘
Good Die Young,” was banned from
the campus's student run radio
station when one student
complained that the song was “lath
Catholic.” ;

The song is about the seductiop of
a girl growing up under the textual
mores of the Catholic Church. ' nd
its lyrics say. “Come out Virgihia.
don‘t make me wait. You Cath'olic
girls start much too late.” _ i

One disappointed DJ claims ti-
Catholicism had little to do withfthe
banning. however. It seems some of
the disc-spinners often followed the
lyrics with comments like “How
