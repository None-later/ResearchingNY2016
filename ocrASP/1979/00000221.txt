' State and Arizona tied In the team competition for the national

Each of the various competitions
are different. and require different
things of the swimmers. Of course.
the team competition is usually the
most difﬁcult. since there are a lot
more girls in it. and synchronization
is that much harder.

"1 ﬁnd the team competition the
most taxing." said University of
Wisconsin team member Amy Bull.
“You trail all year 'round for a few
hours a day. and try to gel the syneh
as perfect as possible. But with eight
girls. it‘s so easy for one little thingto
mess up an entire routine."

Nothing was "messed up" in
Albany. as the team competition
'proved to be the highlight of the
weekend event. On Saturday night.
after the trio competition. the top
seven squads participated in this
exciting event of eight woman
synchronization.

The six judges watched carefully
and closely its each team made its
way through a few minutes of
carefully chosen music. and in near
perfect synch. performed an aquatic

symphony of movement and grace.

The teams are rated on design,
control. execution. and content, all
well-rehearsed and prepared in
advance. Each team tries to add its
own creativity and imagination to
the required movements. and it is
that which adds a ballet-like
impression to the viewer.

in the team competition, both of
Ohio State‘s squads and Arizona‘s
one were simply fantastic.
combining clever originality, and
ﬂawless synch. Ohio State's high
score of 59.8 out of 60 was exactly
matched by the girls from Arizona.

Nothing could have made
everyone happier, since both teams
performed so exceedingly well. and
it was very hard to choose between
them.

After the team competition on
Saturday. the awards were given out.
and trophies were presented to all

to get dressed for some parties they
were going to.

The sentiment of Ruth Pickett.
from the University of Michigan
sums it all up:

“1 swim as a release. It feels so
good to glide tli'rough the water. in
perfect synchronization with the
other girls. it‘s such a good feeling"
