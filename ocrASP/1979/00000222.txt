The Downtown Blades captured
.the 1978-79 Dennis Elkin Cup as
they beat the Cheap Shots. 6-2, on
Sunday for the A.M.l.A floor
hockey championship. Captain
Mike Ferrentino pumped in two
goals and added an assist to lead the
third-year terfm to their first crown.

The Blades started slow, failing to
clear the puck on three separate
occasions on the very ﬁrst shift ofthe
game. Point man Tim Shaugnessy
blocked the third attempt and sent
the disc to top playoff scorer for the
Cheap Shots. Larry Shilling.
Shilling‘s backhandcr went by the
inside post to the right of Blade
goalie Mark "Bo" Bailey and sent
the Cheap Shot entourage into
liysterics. as well as give the Shots
the l-0 lead.

Duiley's counterpart. Bill
Springer, decided he wouldn‘t mind
winning this particular contest and

came up with sprawling saves for the
rest of the period, the most
incredible an Andy Firestone-to-
Frank Caren slot play in which
Carrea was denied half the net. The
Cheap Shots held on to the 1-0 lead
through one period. although feeling
offensive pressure from the Blades.
who held the territorial advantage.

Period two was all Blades. and the
result was two goals for a 2-1 lead.
Ron McManus scraped his way to
an unassisted score two minutes into
the stanza. Off a scramble to
Springcr‘s right. McManus found
the puck on his stick and proceeded
to score the “most important goal" in
Blade history. Blade pressure was
incredible. but Springer was up to
the test. Ferrentino and Rick Simon
worked a give-and-go across the
Cheap Shot crease with the three-
time scoring champion rippling the
cords at 7:30 for that 2-1 lead.

Official Problems Cancels
Spiker-Rochester Match

by David Osborn

The failure to enlist a group of
officials forced the cancclation ofthe
Albany Stale-Rochester volleyball
contest Saturday afternoon and
threw the playoff picture in the
lZCVi. into l'uther confusion.

Tentative plans call for the Danes
to travel for another try at Rochester
Friday afternoon. Albany beat
Rochester earlier this month and if
they can turn the trick again they
would boost a 13-] conference mark
and force a playoff with CorneJ who
holds the same record. The winner
would advance to the playoffs.

Since the earlier Dane-Rochester

encounter was held at Rochc'ster
Albany was scheduled to host the
rematch. However, according to
Dane Rob Harrington. taco-captain.
Rochester had. legitimate reasons
why they couldn‘t makethe trip and
Albany was forced to be the
visiting team once more. But
the Danes were still responsible
for assembling a team of ofﬁcials.
The many volleyball tournaments
currently underway in the area dried
up the supply of ofﬁcials and none
could be located. The game was
called off. if a similar situation arises
Friday, Albany will be declared the
victor. I

Downtown Blades Take  Title

George Baldwin silenced I
boisterous Cheap Shot corner with
the Blades third goalth 30 seconds
into the third peri . courtesy of a
Ferrentino slot pus. From then on
in the decision was barely in doubt,
as the Blades/ kept the puck in the
Cheap Shot end for,‘ most of the
duration. Carrea and Firestone tried
it again. this time with success, for a
4-] lead. while Ferrentino and
Simon encored three minutes later to
make it S-l. Larry Forte and Mike
Cueci traded goals, but the outcome
was just about recorded by then and
the Blades had the AMlA
championship shirts.
lce Chips: Ferrentino also led all
playoff scorers with 9 points (3
games) . . . Shilling (8) was second
. . . Alltimc record number of teams
this season. 38. with only4forfeiting

only damper on anotherwise

Stickmen Lose

('rmlinm'd from page [9
post like a bullet. The second shot
seemed to get away from him as it
bounced over the net and harmlessly
continued out of bounds.

The first half ended with Albany
trailing IO-7.

Coming out smoking. the Danes
scored four unanswered goals to
start the second half. including the
second of Hcimerle‘s twirlingcrowd-
pleasers and Albany was back on top
ll—IO.

Oswego responded with. a goal.
followed by two more Dane tallies
which kept the" Albany stickmcn
just ahead of‘ the always pressing
Lakers. The Danes gave up two
more goals, before Mark
Wnterstram circled in front of the
Oswego net and scored on an
unassisted goal. Once again. the
Danes were ahead by the slim
margin of one goal.

Walker then tied the score for
()swego on a blast that scooted by
goaltender Ken 'l‘irman more like a
ground ball to left ﬁeld than a
lacrosse shot. The Lakers hit home
again right after that. to lead the
game 15-14 with only minutes
remaining.

But the Danes weren't ready to get
out of the afternoon rain. not yet.
Heirmerlc carried the ball into the
thick of the Oswego defense and put
the game back into a deadlock with a
goal from just in front of the net.
Willi time rapidly running out, the
nextteumto scorelookedlikeagood
bet to win.

it was Walker who proved to be
the Danes‘ ultimate un-doing.
Scoring on what could only be
considered a luck shot. he put the
grime finally out of reach as time
elapsed, with the score l6-15 Ono/run

"I made two bonehead plays
myself which really hurt us." Motta
continued. “The ﬁrst was on a delay
of game penalty at the start of the
second half, and the second was on a
stalling call. The second onc's what
really hurt us. The ofﬁcial had issued
an order to clear the ball.‘but I didn't
realize it. I told 'l‘irman to hold it and
we got called for stalling. The ball
went over to Oswego and they
scored. if that hadn‘t happened We
might at least have gotten a tie or
maybe have won the game."

“Oswego was a good team."Motta
littld. “But our next opponent RPl
will be it lot tougher."

'l'he Rl’l game will be at the Troy
school on Wednesday.
