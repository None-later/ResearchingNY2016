age Hall stage but I wish them the best of
ck.
i think everyone is overrcacting. How can
ey expect violence at a concert where the
I d singers's falsctto range is only rivaled by
e FM band? I mean “Telephone Linc"is not
v actly the most politically unsettling of rock
' roll ballads. And why will everyone who
cs into the theatre have to be searched?
on. thet'sjust plain unfair. You know we'll
st ﬁnd new places to stash our wood like in
 r underwear, sox or afro. i mean give it up.
ELO has every right to play here. llJormu

The lmpotents

- the Editor:

at normal American woman attending
llcgc I have normal American woman's
eds. Unfortunately, because inttcnd SUNY

Albany, llﬁnd tnysclffrustrutcd by the boys

rc.

'Thc main problem with them is that thcy'rc

. or most..so immature. But, thcy‘rc also

tty bad looking. Either they ltlch ll face
d no bad or a bod and a pizzu for a face. i
an you guys are hurtin!
nd believe me guys, in bud you‘rc quickcr
n a three minute egg. Sometimes. i'd rather
have the egg! You may not know this but for

' us it's quality not quantity.

SUNYA guys are always looking for JAPs
too. Tltcn when you can't get 'cm you
complain how tltc girls on this campus suck

‘(ordon't). You know as well as i do thatthcrc
are plenty of good looking normal girls that
will satisfy you better physically and

‘ emotionally, so wake up.
. .3, Don‘t judge it girl by the amount of make-
up that pccls off ltcr face.

Tough Shit

' ‘ o the Editor:

lum it Freshman here at SUNYA, and buy:
_ am reading “Letters ot the Editor" sincc the
cginning of fall semester. it sccms that
cryonc has a pet peeve or pressing social
c they fch they must spook out on. People
IVL: written in telling us tltcir opinions about
ffcrcnt problems hurt: at SUNYA, and
Tcring solutions to rctncdy tltcsc mttludics.
ut to dutc I have not seen one lcttcr which
cuts, with tho basic issue. The simple fact of
ltc mttttcr is, the bathroom tissue supplied by
‘l t- his universityis muchtoo worse. How can we
udcnts bc cxpcctcd to exhibit a spirit of
topcrution und brotherhood when we are
. cnicd this basic comfort of home. It is no
ondcr you ﬁnd apathy, vandalism, and just
plain unsocinl behavior rampant on this
umpua. Last month my butt got a butch of
toilet paper that was so bad that my suitcmatc
, ’ sad it to sand down the door to his room,
which had been sticking since we got here. i'm
happy to report the door works fine now,
Some people may ﬁndthis funny. but ithink it
. tlustratcs seriousness of the situation, the
dangers of which are many times multiplicd
for thosc of us who eat lunch in the quad
cafeterias. This is no laughing matter. if the
university would spend the cxtrtt money
needed to get a higher quality bathroom
tissue, they may find thcir costs for replacing
vandalized school propcrty dccrcnse, while
gcncral morulc will be sent soaring. Let‘s go
SUNYA, wc bundcdtogcthcrtoﬁght the hike,
now it's time to focus our cncrgics to wipe out

this cquully pressing problem.

To the Editor:

Since its formation in 1967, the Tiny
African Republic of Gongzawic has come a
long way in granting rights to its white
citizens. Oncc oppressed by the invading
central African tribes and sold into the white
slavery market the notch whites have been
given their emancipation.

As oflnst Monday, they were given the legal
status almost to the degree that their Negro
imperialist tyrants have. They may own up to
two acres of land plus a donkey and travel
about the country with thcirspccini visas. The
minister of elections, italic Koontlu is
expected to hold a press conference by the end
of thc wcck outlining the voting rights of the
new citizens.

We ask your support for thcsc pcopic, by
coitgrcguting in the campus center at l0:00
n.m. to llcllr it spcukcr address thc crowd. We
will then all hop on bust-s for a statewide
demonstration at the SUNY building
downtown. at “:30. Show those white folks
in Gongzowic that we llrt.‘ willing to support
this new libcrul rcgimc. I.ct thc Gongzowittn
aristocracy know we think they're taking a
step in the right direction. lNVEST NOW!

S/ U is DooDoo

To the Editor:
1 cannot, by any mcuns understand why
they are again extending the S/ U deadline. As

' a second year bio major with a 3.77 index, this

distresscs me to no and. By extending this
deadline it will make all the othcrcums in my
department rise by at least .43 putting many
people up thcrc with mc lending littlc
credibility to my cum. What will graduate
school think whcn cvcryonc graduates from
Albany with it 3.6?

Cop Out

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter anonymously
hccousc if my co-workcrs ct'ct‘ know who l
was, l'd huvc my ltcud hundcd to me. iiut, let
me clarify sonic misconceptionsitbout the city
of Albany l’olicc Dcpurttttcnt. Wc ttrc
competent.

Born and bred in NYC, when: all the
cxcitcmcnt is I'mjust not used to the stagnant
city of Albany. My collcgucs ugrcc. Once in a
while wt: get bored and nccd some excitement
to kccp the blood moving. So what's so
terrible about shaking down at gunpoint an
undergraduate wrcstlcr? I mean, thch was no
damage -» wc'rc sorry, okay?! lic's young, he
can take it. Besides, ifwcdidn't have guns he'd
have bout the shit out of all of us.

Look, we don't got paid very well either.
We're not corrupt though. Because y'ull don't
have roots hen: and we need some quick cash,
you studcnts arc the host tnrgcts. You‘vc got
lots of money unywuy; you're front Long
lslttnd, on EOI’ or wltotcvcr,but you got it.
Just try and gut hcttcr campus security or
something.

As long its you'rc sitting ducks we‘re gonna
get yti.

Edhoﬂal

This is not the real editorial. There is no real editorial. In fact, you are
not really reading the ASP. What you have in your hand is a ﬁgment of

‘ your imagination, as unreal as the A you were planning on getting, the

guy or girl you were planning on spending the night with, and all of the
plans that faded from apparent reality to pure imagination.

What you are reading is an illusion. Actually, it is a ﬁgment of our
imaginations, drummed up to total'._ conf use what’s left of your totally
incoherent mind, destroyed in the ion tretch from Christmas vacation
to Friday‘s long awaited escape. Well in c "‘9 you didn’t know, our minds
have been destroyed too, and therefore, we ttccd no excuse for this issue.

There may not be many here who are all here, but to those that are, we
would just like to say: You‘re crazy! You still have four days to lose your
sanity, so you're going to have to try harder.

Lessons in going crazy:

Read this issue. it drove us crazy.

Read any other issue. They drive us crazy too. They all drive us crazy,
and crazy we are.

Read Focus.

Rood anything, for the written word is knowledge, and knowledge is
indeed crazy.

Stop reading. And start writing, and you will certainly go crazy.

Enough of this. Be serious for a minute. We'll wait. That's long
enough.

Now think! Actually, we’ve been dead serious all along, and
supposedly, we only get to do this once a year, on or about the ﬁrst of
April. We must be serious the other days of the year, and for that, we
apologize.

HA HA! We sure fooled you! This isn't even an editorial! It doesn't
cvon take a stand on anything at all. It has no point, and leads nowhere.
Therefore, you are not really reading it, and as we said earlier, what you
have in your hand is a ﬁgment of your imagination. We have gotten
nowhere fast, and for today, that satisfies us.

Seriously . . .

This special April Fool's edition is not a publication of the Albany
Student Press Corporation, and the Corporation cannot be held
accountable for its contents. I can, on the other hand, so be cool. . .
