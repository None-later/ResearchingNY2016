USOC decided to have groups try
out as teams rather thanindividuals.
The reasoning behind this beingthat
these teams were already used to
playing together and this would
partially compensate for the lack of
time involved. TO coordinate the
tryouts and coach the eventual team
the V USOC chose Frank Somat.
Somat played four years of varsity
disherew while attending the
University of St. Louis. Since then
he has played professionally with
Various teams in the NY city area.
Frank gained All-Pro status in ‘77
and ‘78. while with Mama Leone‘s.
While negotiating what could have
proved to be a record contract. he
was contacted by the USOC and
decided to invest the two years into
further expanding the scope of the
sport.

Who then, will be ' America‘s
representative in Moscow? it will be
none other than a team from Albany

The Knicks have fallen on hard

completing this campaign well below

“We want to start all over. and a
move like this certainly indicates
that intention." Werblin continued.

around town for bad wit. he added,
“Years ago we wanted a doctor in this

The expense money up here is a little

Sauers also told the press he
intends to bring along many of his
favorites from the Albany program.

The talk of the trials was the
power and speed of the SUNYA
competitors. in the New York
tryouts, it was Seotty “Tenhands”
Bowman who excelled. When
Williamson injured his‘Jhand in
warmups. it was Bowman who not
only picked up the slack on the line
but he also loaded with‘ his usual
speed. “Tenhands” has made all-star
at four of the six positions in
disherew this past year. Luck also
seemed to be on the side of the
Albany competitors. In the New
England Regionals they were
trailing University of New
Hampshire with only 3 l/2 minutes
left when New Hampshire's number
six man tripped with a rack of
glasses. shattering them. New
Hampshire lost ﬁve points and their
momentum. Albany was able to
squeak out a narrow win and move
on to the Eastern Regionals in
Chicago. it should be pointed out
that expenses to and from Chicago
came from the pockets OF the
competitors and their friends who
believed in their dream Of going to
Moscow. UAS and the Athletic
Department at SUNYA cotildn't
decide who should fund the team, so
neither did.
