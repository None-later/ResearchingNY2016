Albany State Athletic Director
Robert Ford announced early this
afternoon that starting next year.
Albany's entire intercollegiate
athletic program will move from
Division III to the Division I level of
com tition.

“ his school is ready for big-time
sports." commented Ford. “Judging
from the overwhelming support by
the student population. the move up
to Division I was inevitable."

According to ofﬁcial Division I
bylaws. Albany now must undergoa
number of changes in its athletic
program. Schedules must be
upgraded. improved facilities are
needed. and top-line high school
players must be recruited.

Albany schedule coordinator Joe
Garcia will have the task of revising
every Great Dane schedule to ﬁt
Division I standards. “I've met with
each. cacti, and I think I've got

4 i ' .'said. “The only
are concerned '
about is that!  wanna have
to play Onconta'again."

The proposed schedule changes
will have the Dane football team
facing Penn State. Colgate, and
Michigan. is game that will be picked
up by WAST-TV live from Bleeker

     
   

Stadium. For no known reason.
Albany will also travel to
Plattsburgh to face the Cardinals.
"After our performance against
Ithaca this season, l'm confident that
we can handle our tough schedule,"
Ford said. “We've got a new play
called FG-45. We try to stay close.

' and then in the last minute booml

Dario Arango kicks a ﬁeld goal. and
we win. It can't fail.“

The Great Dane basketball squad
will be faced with a difﬁcult task next
season as well. Their list of quality
opponents includes St. Johns.
Syracuse, Iona. and Latham Shaker
High. Siena attempted to be put on
the Albany schedule. but according
to Dane basketball coach Dick
Saaers. “I told them that we really
had nothing to gain and everything
to lose by playing them. Besides.
everyone know that Siena still
sucks." Commenting on his game
plan against the perennially tough
squads that the Danes will be facing
for the ﬁrst time. Sauers remarked.
“I don't think they will be able to
handle my post men inside.

According to Albany soccer coach
Bill Schiefﬂelin. the soccer team's
schedule will not be changed when
the team moves up to Division 1. “I‘ve

been telling everyone all along that

demay For Modernized  ‘
Schedules To Be Improved~  

we play the toughest schedule of
any Division "I soccer team.” said
Scheffelin. “Well. now we'lljust play
one of the easiest schedules of any
Division I school." ..

The facilities at Albany will also
have to be improved for the upward
move to take effect. The plans for
University Field are to install an
additional 20.000 seats around the
football ﬁeld. and also to put in
lighting ﬁxtures for night games.
However. one problem has left the
plans still indefinite.

"We were very concerned about
Indian and Dutch Quads." Ford
said. “From both oftheirtowers you
can look right down on the football
field. Students will stay up there and
watch the games. rather than paythe
50 ceirts admission. What we‘ve
decided to do is use a very large
tarpaulinulike the ones they use at
baseball games. lfwe can rent one of
the Governors helicopters. we can
take the tarpaulin and drape it over
both of the towers. so anyone in
them will not be able to see out. Of
course. we‘ll remove the tarpaulin
alter the grime." '

success in the past. “It was a tough

 

  
  

decision. but we just had to mova
into a bigger gym." said Sauers.
According to Saaers. the athletic
staff searched for a location for the"
new |5.000 seat arena. and ﬂaw
settled on the circle. betweeri-_ ._
and Colonial Quads. I
“It is the ideal place." Sauers said.
“It's so perfectly round. We won't

As- far as the soccer ﬁeld.
Scheiffelin said that no new location
will be needed. "We love our ﬁeld,"
Scheiffelin said. “Especially when its

SUNY Gets Less Than Expected

Although recent rankings by the . such as number of volumes added.a
Association of Research Libraries
(ARL) placed SUNYA's library last
out of 94 university libraries. “it is

joumsl expenditure. and total
spending towards materials. in
these other areas, SUNYA
generally placed in the seventies.
One category in which SUNYA was
rated highly was interlibrary loans
with 14.000 last year.

"I don‘t know if I should brag
about a high rate of interlibrary
loan. but I forsce it as the main way
to get around the rising costs of

matcrials,“said Schmidt. “We must
develop more effective ways of
providing access to other libraries.

We‘ve got to make it possible to get
to other libraries fastand cheap. and
transfer materials cheaply from each
of them."

  

 

 

    

“We learned th this? institution

cannot expect to arisemble in one:

place the massive collections of
Harvard or Yale. It is economically
impossible in these times.
Therefore. in the future we must rely
on cooperation from other libraries
in the Capital District and hopefully
around the country in order to get
materials for students and faculty."
Schmidt stressed that besides
being a function of age. SUNYA‘s
low ratings are also related to
expenditure. “The division of
Budget has never agreed with our
inﬂation calculations. This year we
got a |0% increase in our budget for
inﬂation. but it is not enough. We
are now in a situation where we will
have to buy less and less each year.

“A tuition increase looks very iffy

get the whole thing in the
supplemental budget. maybe only
half of it." Post said.

'I he executive committee of the

A major difference between
college and other types of libraries
according to Schmidt. is
expenditure on journals (magaz-

Journals are far more important
than books, he said. “We spend over
60% of our budget on journals. and
