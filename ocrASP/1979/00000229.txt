Senator Carl McCall (D-
Manhattan) introduced the
amendment, stating that a tuition
increase would “create another
impediment for students who want
to come to the State University."

McCall‘s amendment did not
provide for the $9.1 deﬁcit. but he
claimed that “if this amendment
were passed. l'm sure we can ﬁnd the
nine million somewhere."

Senator Kenneth Lavalle (R-
Suffolk), Higher Education
Committee Chair. said that in
attempting to work on ways to ﬁll
the budgei gapand forestall a tuition
hike “every option was played out.“
LaValle said that no more cuts could
be made to ﬁll the budget gap.

Senator Linda Winikow (D-
Rockland) supported the
amendment saying that she wasn‘t
convinced that the entire 9 million
was necessary. and that other
avenues could be explored before
dealing with the appropriation
question again iii the supplementary
budget.

there‘s no question about it." he
said of the eighty million gallons of
high level waste being temporarily
stored in liquid form in steel tanks.
“it needs to be solidified and stored
in a storage facility."
“It doesn‘t matter what people say or
feel —v we have to do something
about that waste." said Lahey. He
said that he feels that anti-nuclear
power groups are “very ill~advised"
to stand in the way of establishing a
permanent waste repository.

Some nuclear _opponents have
said that there 'is no acceptable
method of disposing of the wastes.
Dr. Lahey said that Admiral
Rickover. who doesn‘t work under
the same constraints that the
commercial ﬁeld does. has been
solidifying waste since the late 1950's.
in ldaho. using a calcination
process. He said that the
glassiﬁcation process has been
shown to work also.

"To me it‘s not a technical
problem," he sid, “but a political
problem of deciding the site. I think

' it‘s assinine what the government's

been doing. having the DOE go out
to various statesand ask‘How‘d you
like to handle all our radioactive
waste — we'lljust come trotting over
and bury it here.‘ And everybody
says Go to hell —— as they should."

“What they should do is choose
one of their existing federal sites.
either in ldaho. Washington State.
or Nevada. make it into a federal
repository, solidify the waste. and
take care of it."

He said that it's a myth that the
wastes have to be stored forever. If
the government would reprocess the
waste. the isotope with the longest
half—life of 24.000 years. Plutonium.

would be burned up as fuel. The rest '

of the material would have to be
stored fl about 500 years. at which
point it would be well below the level
of radioactivity at which it was
mined. Lahey said.

Government grants forall types of
energy research have been cutback.
Lahey said. “l'm very disappointed
that the government has been so
damn stingy with the money they've
put into all energy forms. It‘s
incredible to me that they've cut off
all DOF. (Department of Energy)

nuclear. fossil ‘—-\all energy.”

He said that there is actually too
much money in solar research, in\
terms of ability to do meaningful
work. and too little in nuclear.
Nuclear energy. he said, is in the
'same category with coal and oil; it's
available now and it‘s dependable.

“Some of the other things that are
more speculative. such as solar. are
very much in the future. l‘m not
saying we shouldn't work on them
— we should and we do. At school
we‘ve a number of contracts in tha
area." in this area ofthe country, he
said. there just isn‘t enough solar
energy available in the months when
you need it. But in states where there
is desert area. be said solar energy
has a lot of potential. Other
alternative energy sources. such as
wind and geothermal. also have
regional potential. said Lahey; “in
my opinion. we should work on all
of them."

As to the charge by nuclear critics
that those who work in the field have
“vested interests" and are thus not
trustworthy spokesmen. Dr. Lahey
said. “You have art incredible

Stony Brook, were ranked higher
than SUNYA. Schmidt replied
that.“with Buffalo. which ranked

“Stony Brook." according to
Schmidt “is slightly larger in size.

more success in allocating theirstate

Neither Schmidt nor Christiensen
felt that SUNYA's last place ﬁnish

“inflation is our major problem."

Christiensen agrees. “We have

control the development of the
collection, through direct selection

subscriptions. They simply don't
have enough money to work with.“

Christiensen added that“as wecut

COMMON MYTH

The Journal of the American
Medical Association is out with a
report that discounts the
effecticenesa of Vitimin C in fighting
the common cold.

The Journal says that 674 Marine
recruits participated in an eight-
week research study in which half
were given Vitimin C and half
received a placebo,

According to The Journal.
researchers found there was no
difference between the two groups in
the incidence or duration of colds,
although the Vitimin C group
claimed their colds were less severe.

amount of what Billboard magazine
calls “the poaching" of disco club
deejays. '

Many of the country's top record
spinners are reprtedly being lured
away from the clubs by radio
stations and major record labels
who make use of the deejay‘s "feel"
for‘disco music.

Many deejsys who formerly
worked only at the clubs have been
called upon by such companies as
Atlantic Records, Capricorn and
RCA to work on the production of
disco act recordings.

According to Bil/board. the
salaries paid by most clubs can not

match the money being offered to
record spinners by radio stations

' and the major record lebles.

Some music industry people are
expressing concern that if too many
of the better deejays are lured away
from the clubs, there will be very few
people left to play the records.

WORM WAYS

if you're plagued by having too
much garbage to get rid of these
days. an investment in some hungry
earth worms might not be a bad idea.

Mary Appelhoff of the
Kalamazoo. Michigan Nature
Center has found that just two
pounds of the wiggly creatures can
eat a pound of organic garbage a day
and will produce 200 to 300 pounds
of potting soil every six months.

Thousands of hungry worms are
currently employed in an
experimental project converting
garbage to a rich soil at the
Kalamazoo Nature Center.
