Gums

The great ﬁsh moved silently in the
night water, propelled by short sweeps of
its tail.

“Herby. take your slimy hands offme,"
said the girl.

f “I thought maybe we could have some
un."

“Forget it creep," she said. “I‘m going
for a swim.“

“Aw gee!“grumbled Hcrby as he began
working on his third six-pack of beer.

The girl swam out from shore. The fish
detected vibrations in the water and
swam closer to the source. it made one
pass by the girl, turned around and, with
its mouth open, moved in for the kill. The
girl screamed hilariously and then it was
all over...

“The last I saw of her was when she
went swimming," explained Herby to
Sheriff Bailey and his deputy the
following mornino

beach for half an hour until the deputy
discovered the body.

“Sheriff, over here! Look at that
contorted face! lt...it looks almost‘like
she was laughing.”

Bailey examined the body.

“She was laughing.” he said. “As a
matter of fact she died laughing."

“What do you mean?" asked the
deputy.

"This girl was obviously attacked by a
killer perch," explained Bailey. “They
don‘t have much in the way of teeth but
their gums are extremely ticklish.
Anyone bitten by a killer perch dies
laughing."

“How horrible!“

“Yes. And now it‘s our duty to find
and destroy the killer perch before panic
sets in on our beaches."

The next morning. Bailey set off on his
hunt for the killer perch aboard the
Seahog. a fishing boat piloted by a crusty
old fisherman named Squint.
Accompanying them was Mat Hopper, a
young marine biologist and an expert on
killer perch.

“What‘s that contraption?" asked
Bailey pointing towards a screen wire

cage.

“it’s a perch cage," replied Hopper. “I
use it to protect myself from killer perch
while photographing them underwater.”

For the next few hours, the three men
on the Seahog chummed the water with
Sugar Frosted Flakes in an effort to
attract the killer perch. During this
period, Hopper filled Bailey in on killer
perch facts. Finally in the middle of the
afternoon. Squint yelled from the bow.

“PERCH AHOY!"

“Wow, look at the size of that perch!"
exclaimed Hopper. “it must be at least
five inches long!"

Hopper quickly put on his scuba gear
as Bailey and Squint lowered the perch
cage into the water. Once the cage was in
place, Hopperjumped in with his camera
and submerged.

Again and again the killer perch
rammed the cage. A determined killer
perch is not easily deterred. Eventually it
managed to squeeze through the wire
cage and bite Hopper on the bellybutton.
Hopper started chuckling. then laughing
uproariously, and then he was silent.

Squint and Bailey saw what happened
to Hopper. in a rage. Squint grabbed his
harpoon. The killer perch approached

The Mattress
Tag Ripoff

Arnold Stccklcr was lying on his bed in
a motel room. A few inches from his head
“its a tag attached to his mattress. It said
“DO NOT RIEMUVli UNDER
PENALTY OF LAW." As Arnold stared
at the tag. temptation grew within him
until he could resist no longer. He
reached out and ripped thc tag from the
mattress. A few moments later he heard
the wail of police sirens growing louder
in the distance until the sirens were
screaming just outside his motel room.

Arnold looked ottt from behind his
window curtain and saw twelve police

the boat and with a grant Squint hurled
the harpoon at it. The harpoon missed
but the line it was attached to wrapped
around Squint's leg and made him lurch
sideways. His right hand dipped
momentarily into the water. instantly the
killer perch struck. biting Squint on the
pinky.

“ ee! Hee! Heel"giggled Squint.“Ho!

He went into an uncontrollable
laughing convulsion and fell against the
gearstick. The boat lurched forward and
seconds later struck some rocks just
below the water‘s surface.

Bailey looked on in horror as the boat
sunk, leaving him swimming helplessly to
face the killer perch. He spotted the
deadly beast 20 feet away .. . l5 feet. . . 10
feet . . . 5 feet. Bailey closed his eyes to
meet his inevitable fate.

Seconds went by but nothing
happened. lle opened his eyes and saw
the killer perch floating lifelessly next to
him. Bailey searched his mind for an
explanation. Suddenly he remembered
something Hopper told him about the
killer perch. They‘re highly diabetic. Of
course. that was it. The killer perch ate
the Sugar Frosted Flakes and died from
an overdose of sugar.

Bailey swam back to shore laughing to
himself.

 

cars lined up a few yards from his door. A

 

 

large number of policemen were
crouched behind the cars.

officer 'l'om Plate on the hullhorn.
“We‘ve got you surrounded this time.“

“No way copper!“ yelled Arnold. “l
ain‘t getting caught holding a mattress
removal rap.“

“Maybe we should go in and get him."
said one of the policemen to officer Plate.

“Too dangerous." replied Plate. “He's
known to have brutally folded, spindled,
and mutilated a computer card up in
Alaska.“

“it‘s the end of the road for you
Stecklcr!" said officer Plate. "We‘ve also
got charges against you for jaywalkng
and overdue library books. Come out
peacefully and we might drop the fines
against you for the overdue books."

“lain‘tmakinganydcals. Youguyscan
still put me away for the mattress tag
ripoff and jaywalking.“

"Those aren‘t the only charges." said
officer Plate. “We‘re in possession of
hard evidence that you swiped a couple of
towels froma Holiday Inn." Plate held up
two towels with “Holiday lnn"written on
them. On each towel were several dirty
hand imprints.

“Either one ofthcse towels is enough to
put you away for a long, long time."

“You don‘t scare me copper!“ replied
Arnold.

“Oh yeah. Well think about this
Stceklcr. Just I5 minutes from now will
be your ll a.m. checkout time. if you‘re
not out of there by that time the motelis
going to charge you for an extra day."

Arnold looked at his watch. Sweat
started dripping down his face as the
seconds ticked ever closer to the checkout
time. His mind retraced the criminal
activities ofthc past year from the time he
maliciously littered a sidewalk with a
Dixie cup to the time he clandestiner
removed the pollution control valve from
his car. As the checkout time drew closer,
hie; conscience grew heavier.

Finally. moments before ll a.m..
Arnold Stecklcr threw open the doornnd
walked with his head hung low in shame
into the arms ofjustiee to pay his debt to
society.
