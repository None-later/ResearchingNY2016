Everyone loves to make lists. Worst
dressed, most popular, best movies, best
looking, best law schools, etc. It's as
American as apple pie, baseball,
television, MacDonald‘s — there I go
again. (Someone stop me!)

Having nothing beter to do with our
time and this space, we decided to make a
list. A list ofthe best. Best what? The best
anything. Figure them out as you read.
Each item is also related to the
previous item by some rhyme or reason,
however obscure. if you don‘t see the
connection, drop us a line, but we'll never
tell.

0.K. — so maybe three or four
almost-best items made the list. But that‘s
the fun. if the list was indisputable, it
wouldn‘t be uniquely ours. And it
wouldn't be necessary. So go make up
your own best list. But, we won't want to
see it.

And now, the envelope, please. The
winners are:

1 dozen eggs, a quart of milk, head of
lettuce, one-half gallon orangejuice, hold
it, that‘s not funny.
