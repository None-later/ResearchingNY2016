Student Tax Revolt

To the Editor:

We do not wish to belahor a moot issue but
we feel some clariﬁcations arc in order
concerning an expenditure of our tax money
for a speaker who represents the PLO. There is
in this case no question of whether they are
terrorists or not. since they take credit for thc
slaughtering of hundreds of innocent people.-

We understand and respect Mr. Tcrzi's
right to express the PLO‘s point of View.
However, 'It is not our responsibility to
provide funds to this terrorist organization to
insure his speaking. We do not feel the best use
of our tax money is one which would result in
a bomb having the print "Funded by SA."

When we contacted people who are active in
the Student Government, we Were told the
issue was petty and that the money was
approved by Central Council 'In order to
remain consistent. Well, if this action is
consistent with past and will be consistent with
future decisions, we would rather not have our
student tax money entrusted in that body.
Therefore. we will vote against the mandatory
student lax when the referendum comes up
this spring. Maybe then our money will not be
used to fund terrorism.

La Vie on Fumer

To the Editor:

I would like to address this letter to those
few inconsiderate individuals who feel thcy
have a right to smoke during classes. These
individuals are not only ignoring all the no
smoking signs and violating the law. but are
also inconveniencing most of the students in
the general vicinity. .

It is very annoying to be in a large lccturc
ccntcr trying to listen to a professor and take
notes. while al the same time being forced to
breathe air which is pcrmcatcd Willi noxious
cigarette smoke. Ifa person wishes to smokc,l
feel it is their right. but I also how a right to
breathe clean air. Some may say that I should
ask whoever is smoking to please stop. yet this
can be very difficult ifthat person is ﬁve rows
behind you and decides to light up in the
middle of a lecture.

In most cases it is not even possible to set:
which person is smoking because they hidc it
under the desk. lfa person can't wait an hour
and ﬁfteen minutes for a cigarette. thcn lhcy
should go outside to smoke. I do not see how
anyone can justify smoking during a class inn
lecture center. Perhaps these few individuals
have not realized that their smoking is
bothering anyone I hope that this letter will
bring to their attention lhc fact that it docs
bother some people and I would greatly
appreciate it if they would confinc their
smoking to outside of Ihc classroom.

Let’s _Talk

To the Editor:

This letter is written in support of the
Speaker‘s Forum decision to invite Zchdi
LIIth Terri. PLO Representative to the UN.

By tactics of harassment and blackmail
some students have sought to cancel Mr.
Terri's appearance on campus. Such action is
not only cowardly and provincial. It is also a
danger to academic freedom.

Not even in New York City with its two
million Jewish Inhabitants. have the citizens
been denied the right to hear the case of the
PLO. Yet in Albany we witness knuckling
under to an idle threat of violence.

The university has a responsibility both to
its academic community and to the public at
large to provide II forum for the fundamental
political issues confronting us. if opposing
points of view can't be expressed and dchntcd
here. each of us. on campus and off. is denied
access to the ingredients essential to informed

political decision.

Those of us whose families endured the
Holocaust must be especially vigilant when
fascism threatens — from whatever quarter.

— Dorothy Spektorov McClellan

Student Abuse

To the Editor:

I‘m writing this letter to inform students of
a rather unique abuse of power.

Last Tuesday. a certain professor. who
shall remain nameless. took it upon himselfto
place two chairs in his classroom doorway
(thus blocking the only entrance) when he
chose to begin class. Since there was no
precedent. one must assume he did this for
grins.

Upon opening the door and ﬁnding the
obstruction. l was obnoxiously informed of
my tardiness and told to come back on
Thursday. Since I was not sure of the exact
Eastern Standard Time. I proceeded to the
nearest SUNYA hall clock in order to
determine the degree of my transgression. I
soon discovered that I‘d been physically
barred from class for being an entire fiflccn

‘scconds lalcl Wow! How tardy can you ch'?

What is this shit? Is it now the prerogative
of faculty members to deny students ofthcir
education and. by so doing. to create a fire
hatard? I always thouqu my payment of
tuition entitles Inc to an education. Why was I
not informed?

Ordinarily. I would have dismissed the
incident as just the product of a warped and
somewhat ecccnlric scnse of humor.
However. Tuesday‘s class covcrcd material
that was included ina test on Thursday. I. for
one. was not amu5cd.

Lets Clarify

To the Editor:

in last Friday's issue of the ASI’ II lcttcr
appeared concerning thc PLO‘s Mr. Tcrti
speaking at the university. Specifically the

letter stated that the PLO rcprcscnlativc
should be allowed to speak since thc PLO
doesn't promote violence, but rather arc the
innocent victims of Begin and Israel as shown
by the Dcir Yassin incident.

I personally am against Mr. Tcer speaking
(or for that maltcr II mcmhcr of any terrorist
group) especially when payment comes from
student tax dollars. Further the reason given
in the Icltcr for permitting Mr. Terri's
appearance is totally inadcqualc.

Dcir Yassin was the sight ofa confrontation
whcrc 254 were killed. This. however. is not
the complete story. Dcir Yassin was one oflhc
two cities on the road connecting Tcl Aviv to
Jerusalem. and was actively keeping food and
watcr from reaching over 100,000 people in
Jerusalem. Its population consisted of 700
villagers. Iraq troops. and Palestinian
soldiers.

On April 10.1948. thc lrgun and Stern gang
came to capture the city. In rcsponsc the white
flags of surrender wcrc waved in the city. but
when advance lrgun forccscntcrcd the city the
lrgun commander was gunned down. This
then started II hIIIllc in which both Jews and
Arahs \vcrc killed. an unfortunate incident
but certainly not II massacre of harmless
civilians.

You might ask why you should lake the
word of someone who is evidently hiascd. So
don’t. in Jordan‘s daily paper Al UrdunI on
April‘). 1953 Yuncs Alinch Hassad.a rcfugcc
from Dcir Yussin. was quntcd as saying. “The
chs never intended to hurt the population of
the village but were forced to do so after they
met hostility from the population which klllcd
the lrgun commander.“

Thcrcforc whcn the PLO kills civilians and
uses excuses like these to substantiate their
actions. thcyarc in fact doing lilllc more than
senseless slaughter. Ily not accepting the
Sadat-Begin peace agreement they are
actually defeating llicir own purpose. We
therefore should have to question their true
motives.

What Cost Energy?

Nuclear power. a source of energy some claim will save us when gas
and oil run out, will more likely prove to be the downfall of man, ifall
that has happened recently is any indication of its overriding
detrimental effects.

In the short time that we have been working with nuclear power, there
have been too many foul-ups. mishaps.accidcnts and mistakes. Nuclear
pow/er is the most dangerous weapon known to man, and those who call
it the energy answer must also realize that it could prove to be as
destructive as any missile that comes sailing from Russia or soaring
from China.

An accident at a nuclear power plant has the potential to kill
thousands and affect the lives of people not even born yet for
generations to come. There have been too many close calls for us to sit
back and say that the real thing won‘t happen; that a meltdown will
never actually take place.

It can take place! And it almost did. The dirc incident that occurred at
Three Mile Island ncar l-Iarrisburg. Pa. should be enough ofa warning
to merit the scrious consideration of our nuclear energy goals. and
weigh thcir wisdom.

ll sccms ridiculous to throw our future cncrgy plans in a direction
that is by far the most dangerous of all choices. and one which will run
out the fastest. ,

When supplics arc dcplclcd. wc still how to find ncw sources of
cncrgy. but we will also bc lci'l Willi I'udioIIclivc wuslcs that will pass on a
danger for thousands of yczII's to comc. to thousands oi'gcncrulions to
come.

Tth" arc much safer outlcls for cncrgy llIIIl can bc dcvclopcd and
pcri'cclcd. but won't be as long as conglomcrulcs tll‘L‘ allowed to build
nuclcur powcr plants. simply bccuusc Ihcy‘d losc too much money by
switching directions. 'I'hcsc special interest corporations arc being
prolcctcd by our govcrnmcnl. III lhc pnssihlc cost of our lives. or our
children‘s.

With all of thc efforts being InzIdc to sccurc arms limitations between
the super powcrs. how cu ll ()lli' govcmmcni not scc that we are
I'Iu'rcasing our dangcr inlcrnaily fIIslcr than \vc arc averting it
cxtcrnully.

Something must be done. ’I'hcrc arc too many ilLiCICili‘ plants in this
country. and more are bcing couslruclcd chry your. Must wc wait until
u mclldown docs occur. and disuslcr strikcs. bcforc r‘ulixing how
utlcrly sclf—dcstruclivc it is to procccd on a path that Invites
catastrophe?
