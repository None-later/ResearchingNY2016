With only three teams in his
conference, Albany State volleyball
coach Ted Earl is hoping to keep up
friendly relationships with the two
other squads. But the rapport with
one. Cornell. may haw: been
impaired Wednesday night.

“it‘s really hard when you’re
trying to build good relationships
between our two teams and they
have to go home like this." said a
disgruntled Earl afterthe Dane win.
“They feel they got the short end of
the ofﬁciating. i think they missed a
few calls on both sides and nothing
was out of line.

The Big Red captain and several
players milled around the court for
about 15 minutes after the match

The Albany State lacrosse team
went up against a tough RPI squad
Wednesday afternoon in Troy. and
came away on the short end ofa l4-5
SCOFL’.

“We just couldn't pick up any
ground balls." said Dane coach
Mike Motta. “The last game against
RPl we only got 36. it's a skilliust
like catching and throwing. anti we
just had a rough game.

“i also thought the team didn't
show much hustle. We were flat."
Motta said.

RPl attackman Jay Torcucci led
the Engineers for the game with six
goals and three assists. For Albany.
attackman Bill Schmohl had one

goal and three assists and each ofthe

Danes other attackmcn threw in a
goal.

“The lll’l gonltcndcr had an
excellent game. coming up with i5
saves." said Mottn. "iiut ottr
goaltender Kcri ’l'irniari also had a
good game coming tip with l5 of his
own."

Motta said for the second game in
a row the entire Albany defense left
something to be desired. but that the
Dancs' midfielders did do a good
defensive job overall.

“Eleven of their l4 goals ‘amc
frotn their attackman." Motta said.
“So at least our midfielders were
doing it pretty good job on their
men.“

Ri’l used a lone defense against

the Danes which caused Albany
quite a bit of trouble.

“The [one requires a little
different movement. We don‘t use
one ourselves. so we don't see it too
niucii even in practice. Since we
don‘t see it everyday it's tough to
adjust to when we do hit it." Mottri
said

The Dancs were down 5-3 at the
end ol the first half. but R H picked
tip nine tiiorc goals to Albany‘s two
in the second half to take the game.

Albany‘s next game is against

standings with identical 3-] loop
marks. A showdown for the playoff
would then be played at Cornell.
probably on April 16.

Earl. who said he thought tbecalls
were fair, was upset over Cornell's
frustration and he followed the Big
Red players down into the lockers.
With a look of anxiety. he stood
talking with Cornell players in front
of the cubicles and his neat brown
suit struck a contrasting note with
the sweaty, annoyed players.

The Cornell Squad told Earl there
were no hard feelings towards him,
just towards the officials. The Big
Red captain said he felt Bunard. the
top ref in this area. had favored
Albany after he handed out a
disciplinary warning to Cornell's
Dave Bibb. That instance bad
occurcd in the second game.

Cornell was scheduled to play
Rutgers-Newark Wednesday but
instead they opted to play the Danes
in the makeup ofa postponed game
from early March. if they hadn‘t
come Albany would have received
the forfeit win so the Big Red was
thus doubly infuriated that they had
canceled another match simply to

' Cornell Knocks Ofﬁcials In Loss To Spikers

play a game where a forfeit would
have yielded the same rcSult.

Albany had not played a
competitive match since March 24
and they worried that the layoff
might have hurt them. The
prolonged rest proved to be no
problem. however. as they played a
solid. thorough match. Many
players had missed practice for the
past week due to exams and
expressed surprise themselves at
their performance.

“i haven't played at all in about
ﬁve days and we haven't had a match
in about ten.“ said Eric Stern. a
bespectacled sr. with a wide range
of serves. all of which seemed to
cattsc trouble for Cornell. "i usually
plan to do my school work around
this time of the term notcountirig on
any matches. liut it didn‘t seem to
hurt us that much."

At 1—] in the fourth ganic. the
Danes went on a hill‘l that saw them
wiri seven of the next eight points
and take a commanding 8-2 lead
which they never relinquished. Stern
and Howard Nusinov. a tall soph.
led the charge. Nusinov scored with

Before Wednesday‘s season
opening match at the Capitaland
Tennis Club. Albany's head coach
Bob Lewis was a bit apprehensive
about his team's chances in the
afternoon contest.

First ofall. tlic Danc‘s were facing
Amltcrst.a powerful Division l team
that had beaten them iii their
previous match last year. Secondly,
though it was the first match for the
Danes since last October. the
Amherst squad wasjust coming off a
nine match southern tour. “Wc‘ve
had no match experience." said
lewis. “They're going to be a little
more experienced than Wt: are at this
point."

Nevertheless, the Danes
through triumphantly. defeating
Amherst by the score of 5-4. “For
our first match." said Lewis. “l was
very satisfied."

The Danes were led in the match
by their top three players. Paul
Feldrnrtn. lnrry Liriett and Lane
Lerner. Feldrnan. coming out of a
sick bed to play. defeated Bill

Schmidt in indcntical 6-4 sets. Linct
trounced Joe Belanoff 6-0. 6-l and
Lerner edged Tab Rosenfeld 5-7. 6-
1. 6-2.

Earlier. Coach Lewis had said
that be felt the Dane‘s top asset was
their strength in their highest ranked
players. while their biggest weakness
was in their lowest positions. “We're
very strong at the top.“hc said. “but
ﬁve and six are questionable. Mikc
Fcrtig is a very steady player at
four."

lewis was provcn correct as

number five Andy Atitosyyk lost to

‘SUNY/CUNY Merger Is Possible

‘by Aron Smith

A New York State takeover ofthe
City University of New York
(CUNY) has been proposed to the
state legislature by Assembly Higher
Education Committee Chair Mark
Siege] (D-Manhttttari). Under the
newly released proposal. the state
would assume fiscal anti
administrative authority over
CUNY by graduation over a four
year period.

A possible merger of lllC'
two systems was considerch
last‘ year by SUNY Chancellor
Clifton Wharton. anti three years
ago by the Wesscl Commission
(Temporary State Commission on
the Future if Postsecondary
Education in New York State). The
commission’s recommendations
were rejected by the legislature:
Wharton set out the pros and cons of
a SUNY/CUNY merger in a staff
paper that 'was never acted
upon. .

“The City University will

not be a part ofSUNY." guaranteed
Siege]. "That’s our objective. to
maintain it asa separate system. The
fact that they have the same funding
source does not mean that they're
the same thing. The Department of
Mental Hygiene has the same
funding source as SUNY. That
doesn’t mean that they’re part of
each other.“
