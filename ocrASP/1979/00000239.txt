Strategic Arms Negotiation
‘ Moving But Not Done

WASHINGTON (AP) The United
States and the Soviet Union have
settled perhaps the key remaining
issue in the strategic arms
negotiations. but still are not ready
to sign a treaty. administration
sources said Thursday.

Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly
Dobrynin scheduled a meeting for
late Thursday to discuss the
remaining differences.

Mindful of unanticipated issues
that have arisen in the past to
confound the negotiators, officials
refused to predict when the talks
might end..

State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter said “real

problems“ remain to be resolved by
Vance and Dobrynin before the two
sides discuss a summit meeting.

The U.S. sources. asking not to be
identiﬁed. said agreement had been
reached on the rules for deﬁning a
new missile type during the duraaion
of the SALT Il pact. The definition
of new missile types has been a
major unresolved issue. '

The treaty would limit each side to
developing one new land-based
intercontinental balistic missile
system.

The American negotiators have
been trying to get the Soviets to
accept tight rules for deﬁning a new
missile out of fear that the Soviets
might dramatically improve an

a new missile. " ‘
According to the sources. the two
sides have agreed to the American
suggestion that any change of
missile characteristics such as size

1

and weight in excessgfs percent will -

mean that the missile must be
counted as a new weapon under the
treaty‘s limitations. Sources said the
Soviets had sneeceded in whittling
down the number. of characteristics
affected by the 5 percent rule.
