It's just different traditions. I’m just
saying that it is possible to have
seprarately funded educational
institutions. 100 percent funded by
the state. without having them run
by the same central administrative
agency. It‘s very common, as a
matter of fact."

In a prepared statement. CUNY
Chancellor Robert Kibbee
expressed a desire to maintain
GUNY's independenccby retaining
a separate Board of Trustees and
continuing to give the New York
City Mayor a role in selecting its
members.

SUNY And CUNY May Merge

CUNY’s Board of Trustees is
presently comprised of seven
members selected by the mayor and
seven members selected by the
governor. The fourteen members
then jointly select the ﬁfteenth
person. Siegel recommends that the
presidents of CUNY‘S students and
faculty senates each continue to
serve on the Board as ex»ofﬁcio
members. He further recommends
that they be granted voting
privileges. should their counterparts
on the SUNY Board of Trustees be
granted the vote.

Kibbec has come out in favor of

funding of CUNY. although the
minimal figure involved may
amount to a token action.

“The University‘s historic and
mutually beneﬁcial relationship

with its parent city must be
maintained.“ said Kibbee. .
“The important thing is the

control over the budget.“said Sicgei.
“if the state sets the budget leveland
them assesses the city for some small
percentage of that. the city has really
no role or participation in the
decision making. More important
continuation of the city role was
through the structure of the
governing board. where the mayor
retains one-third of the
appointments. and two-thirds ofthe
appointmentsfrom both forces must
be resonance of New York City. But
to have the city contribute a small
amount of money “Illltllll inning
any budgetary control is merely to
tax the city for what otherwise is

IOU"? state funded around the state."

“The city does not want to pay for
it any longer." said Rothstein. “They
don‘t want the University. That's
what it comes down to, Docs
Buffalo pay for SUNY Buffalo? No,

of course not. They want the state to
do what they did for the other
iowns."

Wharton. Kibbee. and Governor
Hugh L. Carey have been discussing
the achievement of a balance in
tuition levels between SUNY and
CUNY for the past two years. If
state funding of the CUNY system
passes into law. the imagined
phenomenon of SUNY and CUNY
students paying identical bills may
become a reality.

“i imagine that. at a future date.
we'll have some effect on tuition.“
said Rothstcin. “There are a couple
.of problems down there that haven}
really been taken care of. York
College needs some building as do a
couple of older places. They'll ltavc
to do some building at some point in
the future. Their buildings are older
then SUNY's. for the most part."
However. O‘l.cary feelstltat Siegel's
proposed measure could be passed
without affecting a further increase
in tuition for SUNY students.

"To the extent that you fund
(.‘UNY. whether they‘re a part of
SUNY. you make another demand
on the slate treasury; said O‘Lcaay.

 

“Will that demand translate imo a
further tuition increase? i don.‘
think that the demand is um
signiﬁganl that it necessarily should
be resulting in tuition increases.
Tuition increases are going u, be
settled on much broader issues tlicn
CUNY and SUNY being financed
by the state. I would doubt that
|Il0% funding of CUNY requires it
tuition increase. The State (ll NC“.
York could afford to fund CUNY
l00% without a tuition increase for
either CUNY or SUNY."

C011(ages Demonstrate Against Apartheid " '-

(PINS) Drawing on tactics used by
their campus counterparts over a
decade ago. students have once
again resorted to demonstrations as
a means of protest. This time the
issue is not the Vietnam War, but
apartheid. Students across the
country have demonstrated at
colleges to protest their
schools‘ ownership of stock in U.S.
corporations that operate in - or
have dealings with - South Africa.

Three weeks ago. Columbia
University joined at least ten other
colleges and uniicrs'ities across the
nation in selling its holdings.
following student protests against
South Africa‘s system of strict racial
segregation. i‘lic university
announced that it had sold $2.7
million worth of stock in three batik
corporations because of their loans

. lo the South African government.

The stocks sold represent less than

one-fourth of the university‘s total
securities in 44 companies which
reportedly had assets in South
Africa. These holdings represented
about 35 percent of Columbia‘s
Investment portfolio.

Columbia President William J.
McGill said “it is possible" for the
university to loquate its stock in
some aditionaa banks or
corporations as welifAccording to
The New York ’l‘r'rrrm'. American
banks have outstanding South
African loans ofat Icaat $2.2 billion.

There are more than J50 US.
firms with direct investments in
South Africa totalling ncaaly $l.7.
billion. about l7 percent of all
foreign investment there. The list of
companies includes Ford. Geiicraa
Motors. Chrysler. Coca-Cola.
Mobil. General Electric and IBM.

“The real problem spots in CUNY
are in the community colleges.
because again. for the most part.
they are funded by the city." said
Rothstein. “You‘ve got the Borough
of Manhattan Community College
(llMCC). Then you‘ve got Hostos.
These are two real problem colleges
right now. Hosto‘s is out of. factory
and BMCC has an empty campus.
They’re in a bunch of old school
buildings. it"s a real problem. I
don‘t know what the city's going to
do about that.

Sicgel‘s program also provides for
the cutoff of all CUNY capital
construction projects not in progress
by June 30th. New construction
would be required to be conducted
in accordance with state legislator
regulations. CUNY would be given
triitil next year to come tip with
along term feasible plan for capital
construction. which would then be
submitted to the legislature.

“There could be a trade off that
nobody knows about." said
Rothsteiii. “Carey could take all the
‘schools in CUNY. like he’s doing
I now and fund them. and they say.
‘Okay (New York City Mayor
. l Edward) Koch. Build BMCC. Build.
Hostos.“‘

“The city won't put anything
through because it can‘t afford it."
said Siegcl. “It can't."
