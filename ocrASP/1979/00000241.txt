Bills Proposed For Bikeways

Albany (PINS) While some see the .

U.S.A. in their Chevrolets. bicyclists
in New York may soon View their
state from a netwark‘of bike trails.‘

Two New York State assembly-
men have proposed three bills

‘which, if passed. would develop a
statewide system of bikeways. The

Nationaa Bicycle Manufacturers
Association (NBMA)estimates than
8.5 million New Yorkers. nearly
half of the state‘s population. are
bicyclists.

Assemblyman Ricard Wen/(RC—
l.ong Beach) has introduced two
bills to establish bikeways. The first
calls for the state to spend about a
million dollars for bike-way
construction. alteration anti
maintenance. The second proposal
would require the \lzite Department
of lrnnspui'tntion to acquire
abandoned railroad properties for
pathway location. Federal funds
are ll\‘(|lllll‘)lt,' lor bikenny
construction on it 70 percent federal
to 30 percent slate iirzilehrng lurid
basis.

‘ Both bills have been introduced
for the last three years. but they have
never been Aimed on. .The aide

‘speeulated that' members 'of the

Asscmbly TmnsporiatiOii Commit-

tee could not decide where the

necessary state money would come
from.

The answer to this may lie in
to third biking bill. Assemblyman
William Hoyt (D-Buffaloi has
proposed legislation requiring three
percent of the state gasoline tax be
used to construct the state-wide
bikeway system. In I97. New York

State collected approximately $486
billion in gasoline tax. Threerpercent

'of this would be more than $14.5

billion. ‘ .
Herb Morse of the bicycle .
association, whose organization

manufactures 85% of.the bicylces
manufactured in the United States.
said that Oregon, Wisconsin and
California have effectively used
gasoline taxes to fund bikeways.
An aide to Wertz said the bike is

' vital." the aide said. “These bills
vwould help make biking safe and

encourage wider use of this form of
transportafion."
