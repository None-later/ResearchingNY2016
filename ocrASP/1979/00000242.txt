To many of these children. just

experience in itself according to
Graber. _

“A lot ofthc kids had never seena

Peggy Hobcroft.

“The kids now ask us questions
such as ‘How long does it take to go
to college?"; questions that they
might not have asked about before.“

their background and how it affects
the kids.” explained Graber.

Three undergrad coordinators of
the program. Peggy Hobcroft, Kelly
Rccchio. Rick Lawrence and
treasurer Ed Donahue conslut with
Graber to keep the to volunteer-
counselors and 32 children-program
running smoothly. ,

According to Graber. the
untimgrad students who volun-
teered for the program at the end of
last semester. “cared enough to stay
actively involved to set it up from
the ‘ground ﬂoor'. I could never
have done it alone." said Grabci'.

Their hearts are in the tight place
forthc children; theyarc notdoingit
for credit.“ claims Graber.

The program is operated on a
small group basis rather than a one-7
to-onc relationship that is usually set
up between vouluntecrs and

children in a big brother, big sister
program. Graber ‘ feels that it
provides benefits for the volunteers
and the children as well.
According to Graber. the grotip
structure allows_ students a more
ﬂexible schedule as volunteers. “In
case a session is missed by a

volunteer. someone else in the group \

is there to cover for him," he said.

Besides giving the children. a
"steady supply“ of big brothers'and
sisters. Graber feels that the group
basis of the program also provides
the children with psychological
beneﬁts.

“These kids usually have trouble
relating to others, especially to their
peers. The group formation helps
them to learn to interact with
adults as well as their peers,"graber
said.

Graber also claims that the group

So for, some of the surrounding -
community has responded and
shown support for the' program.
The Golden Arrow Bus Company
>offercd the program the cheapest
bus rates so as to pick the children
up. and the Arnold Baking'Co.
donated cokkies for snacks to the
children. according to Graber.

Parental response to the program
has also been favorable. Mothers
from the Albany “Big Brother. Big
Sister“ program have been
enthusiastic. Other parents have
called and want to sign'theirchildrcn
up for the program.

"A university is a good place fora
program like this: it has many
resources and interested students."
Graber said.

SA has proved to be a valuable
resource for the program. “The
ﬁnance and executive budget
committees were very helpful; this
semester we‘ve been funded for5535
and funding for next semester has
been approved." said Graber.

I (iraher worked as an
undergraduate at SUNY~
Binghamton in ii similar volunteer
big brother. big sister program and
worked in a clinic with severely
disturbetl children. As a graduate
student here at SUNYA, he has done
work in variotis child-care
institutions in the community.

(ii‘ahcr looks forward to
extending the program next year to
ineltitle off—campus activities for the
children.

“Even the children are talking
about next year.“stiid Peggy
llobcroft.

The program is seeking more
student volunteers; “we are looking
for people who are truly interested in 1
working with children and those
who are willing to give some of their
time and energies to the program.”
said Graber.

There will be ads posted around
campus about the program in the
future and a general interest meeting
at the L g" ‘ of the fall semester
