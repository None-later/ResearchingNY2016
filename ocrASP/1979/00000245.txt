SA“ and Gaines/Aro/noff had some
ridiculous joke stemming from a huge
personal they put in the ASP about a
“bear in the woods seeing the light."

Dan Gaines was in a very unusual
situation during this campaign. You see,
Gaines was crossing the fence by running
—— hehad once been cditor-in—chicf ofthe
ASP. Naturally. SA perceived him as the
ASA candidate. but the ASPdidn't. To
us. Gaines was trying to become “one of
them". and we made damn sure that he
was treated with the same disdain its the
rest of the candidates. Actually. Gaines
would experience more trotiblc tlitin the
other candidates because of his ties to the
paper. Objectivity. you know.

Personal problems forced Gaines to
withdraw from the race in the final weeks,
leiiving Arotioff on his own.
