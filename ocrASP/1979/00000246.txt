Uninvited Lunch Guest- Sitting in a.

Roach. Goodbye appetite.

“We. did some work at the State
University. Cockroaches in the
cafeterias," says Regis Chaunot of LA.
Moore & Co., exterminators.

“Cockroaches are the hardest job.
They get into‘evcry little crack and
crevice." Chaunot explains. “The

German Cockroach is__the most common

   
 

The mouse is were abundant in the album) area

here. it's abottt 3/4 inches long. The
American C‘ockroach is bigger, but it‘s
not as common."

Chaunot got into tlte business 2| years
ago. At the time, he had a small dairy
farm and needed a tentporaryjob. Dairy
farming became big business, and
Chaunot had to get out. “Before he knew
it," his wife had five more kids and he was
still exterminatiug. So he stuck with it.

He was not without a general interest'
in the subject, however.

“The higltcst mark l got in college was
in an entomology course a 90
something But, i never did think l‘d be
doing this (20 years) later.“

Today. he says of his job, “It‘s.

unique, and I meet different kinds of
people, too."

The worst case Chaunot has seen in his
exterminating career involved roaches.
‘v “it was a trailer full ofcockroaches,"he
recollects. “The owner asked me to come
spray because she saw ‘a few in the
kitchen‘. They were all over the place . . .
coming out of the ceilings. walls, floors. i
don't know how the people lived there. i
just turned on the fogger and went
outside."

Chaunot explains that a problem in
cockroach control is they become
resistant to many chemicals . . . And
something to ponder:

“Roaches ltave been here since before
the dinosaurs. and they'll be here long
after we‘re gone." he comments.

Expert exterminator Chaunot on
Albany bats:

“There are enough bats around.
There’s not really a great abundance of
them. The main thing is that everyone‘s
afraid ofthe disease, the rabies scare. You

just have to keep them from getting in." -.

Chaunot mentions that DDT was the 
most effective way to control bats, but it
can no longer be used. .

“There are other methods." he adds.
“Screens. moth crystals — the smell will
keep them away. We once had a bat in

our house. i killed it with a tennis racket." ‘

"It‘s in there, a mouse or something.“

Apartmentmate bravely volunteers to
battle the creature with a pot. Poised to
kill, he waits. several feet beyond the
closed door.

The door is opened. Teeny mouse
scurries ottt into the kitchen. Would-be
killer turns and runs for his life. Mouse
escapes behind cabinets in the kitchen.

There are a lot of mice around this
area,'according to Chaunot.

“There are field mice all over,“ he says.
“The important thing (ifyou have one) is
not to leave food around. Set a trap. That
should take care of it."

Mice, along with cockroaches and rats
comprise what Chaunot (and other
exterminators) term “the big three" ‘—
ttamed for the comparatively large
incidence of these particular pests in the
past. liut actually, calls about rats are not
common for Chaunot.

"I can't speak for the other companies.
but l don‘t know of many problems with
rats.“ he says. “One company was hired
to clean them from the sewer system, but
that‘s it. They (the rats) just go to
garbage.“ '

Sometimes. though, he meets rats
unexpectedly.

“I was crawling ina cellar once ~---- and i
looked up and a rat was looking at me.
We both ran the other way.“

the Carpenter Ants. Chaunot describes
tltcm as "large and black-not red, brown.
..." ln cotttpa rison to "normal" tints. they
are about 3/8 to l/2 inches larger.

“Carpenter ants live in the wood. attd
do damage to it. Then. they enlarge their
colonies," says Chaunot.

The Carpenter ants are bigger,
stronger, and »-— harder to dispose of.

“You can‘t get rid of carpenter ants
with those ant traps,“ warns Chaunot. ul

traps all over her house. They didn‘t do

controlled if there is no food around.“

But if a house is cleaned up, and the
carpenters return after about three or
four weeks. Chaunot suggests that it
would be time for an extermittator. Have
anyone in mind‘.’

Carpenter ants now make up a large
proportion of Chaunot‘s calls. He sees
them as actually accounting for more
business than members of the exclusive
“big three."

Chaunot rcalires from
experience the ease with which carpenter
ants can cttter a home.

“With everyone bringing in ﬁrewood

differentiated, if you know what to look

. for. “Ants have an hourglass shape, a

ﬁgure etght, pinched waist. Termites have
a straight figure."
Better to be infested with flying ants
than termites.
Termites are the worst pest problem a
homeowner can have. They are the
costliest to exterminate. a process that
involves mttch work.
“To exterminate termites, you have to
poison all tltc soil under the foundation
oi the bttilding. You ltave to dig a ditclt
three to six inches deep. and also make
sure you‘re ttot poisoning any water."
Chaunot comments lurther about the
feared pest:
"'l crtuitcs livc itt the soil. They 'at the
cellulose. ’l'hcr: arc wood termites. but
they‘re all down south, not here . . .

_'|'ermites are very adaptable. and very

Sleep Tight, Don't Let the Bedhugs
Bite- Sleepy. In bed. Barely up. Horror
movie quietly plays on the television. Is
that something moving on the wall?
Couldn‘t be. Fall asleep.

Late at night we awaken abruptly.
Startlcd, frightened. Nightmare? Visions
of creepy, crawly things. itchy all over.
Wide awake. Searclt the room. No more
sleep.

“In 2i years, I‘ve only had two bcdbug

jobs," says chis Chaunot. “i guess that

hygiene is muclt better now. . .Those twu
cases show you about the mind over
matter tlting. l was itching before i got
into'tltc house. i ltad to spray ntysclfall
over."

 

So I what art you do to help keep all
these little pests away?

Cltaunot constantly stresses
cleanliness. “Any rodent is jttst looking
for food. Make sure that tlterc is no food
(leaving out spaghetti or
it‘s like offeringvrnua steak

something)

Chaunot explains. But. they ca be'

 

     
     
 

  

or a hamburger. You‘ll take the steak."

But. when nothing works, it‘s time for
an expert, like Chaunot, to move in. How
does he feel when he successfully
exterminates the pests at hand?

“When the guys say ‘Oh, boy, you did a
good job,‘ it gives you a feeling of
satisfaction, like any other job," he
answers.

But it is a unique occupation. Would
lte encourage his kids to go into the
business?

“I wouldn‘t tell them not to go into it.“
Chaunot points out that a person cannot
jttst go into the exterminating business.
"You have to be certiﬁed by the EPA

'I'ho third mcmbor of the big three is the soldom-soon rot.

(Environmental Protection
Tests must be taken before they let you
handle cltemicals.“ Chaunot also
emphasizes the distinction between
fumigation and extermination.
“Fumigation is a tnuclt more complicated
process. The entire building must be
sealed off ~ every little crack. etc. 'l'h: _.
use methyl bromide. and that will kill
anything and everything iii the building.
They have to use gas masks. . . lt‘samuelt

more expensive process.“

Chaunot says that the pest situation in
Albany is in no way unique. It's basically
the same throughout the state. His
company, consequently. has ofﬁces in
many areas of N.Y. — Buffalo,
Watertown. Utica, etc. —'but no longer
in New York City. There may be a lot of
