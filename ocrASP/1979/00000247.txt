that were she one. “Any diddlin' male
would do“; bttt the cuteness of the
metaphor is thrown off in the last verse
with the plea “Cut the heat out of me ...".
which forces the troubled meaning all too
clearly. Suzzy‘s tale of two frustrated
commuters on “The Train" (“He is
miserable and I am miserable/can't we
have a party/ after all we have to sit here
and he's even drinking a beer ...") slowly
becomes a remorseful tale of shyness. and
an inability to 'get through personal
barriers.

The simplistic lyric to “Pretty and
High"doesn‘t deal in double meaning so
much as a confused woman‘s retreat Into
childhood. (if I take offmydress/ the sky
will fall down/ cause I'm pretty and high

and only partly a lie“) At times. one line
'will'hang like a dark cloud over the rest of
an unexprcssive verse “We went so far
out there. everybody got scared" Terre
sings of leaving home.

Adding to the drama of the songs is the
way the trio utilize backgrottnd vocals to
reinforce lyrics. as the voices assume
different characters in a story. or in a
mind. For example. in Maggie‘s song of
her shaky rejuvenation through affairs
with "The Married Men“ she sings. “()ne
says he'll come after Inc/another one'll
drop me a line/ and one says all myagotty
is in my mind while iii the
background. Tcrre- and SUI/y urgently
echo "drop her a line“ as though to
salvage a drowning comrade. Another
song (“Hammond”) is virtually t
montage of voices trying to manipulate a
young girl in her decision to leave home.
This echo is used most eerily at the end of
“l’relty and High“ as two voices
rhythmically taunt “l.iar...liar...“ at a
woman who is slowly losing her mind.
The lyrical cchos are even more vivid in
performance, as the three move in antl
ottt of characters during a song.

'Ihc Rtlt'llt‘.\' is sttcb a success primarily
because it remains true to their live
performances. if some of the comic stage
banter is lost. the songs are cast in a more
serious light, allowinglor the, lyrical'
subtleties to become more prominant.
l’rodueer Robert Fripp's use of “audio
verite" has basically captured. the trio's
live performances and kept studio self~
indttlgencc to a tnost effective minimum.
The instrumentation is sparse and
focuses attention on the powerful
harmonies. Most songs are accompanied
only by a single guitar. ()n tithersfl'erre‘s
guitar leads are curiously melodic: at first

listen they seem to move against the flow
of the song until one rccogniles the
intricate pattern they form.

The Roehes‘ live shows have always

been outstanding. and last weekend‘s was
no exception. The ‘key to their music is
their characteristic humor which spans
private jokes. characterizations.
anecdotes. and often acts as a buffer for
their unmerciful view of themselvesand
others. Furthermore, this humor is
surprisingly direct when personally
delivered. enhanced by Terre‘s deadpan
delivery. Maggie’s bounce or Suzzy‘s
furious efforts to physicallyexpre-ss what
she thinks she is not making clear. Many
of their most comical numbers are
mocked up cover versions which, alas.
didn‘t make it to the album.

They hardly seemed shaken by their
visit to, yes, Harrisburg. Pa. the previous
weekend. which was spent performing
amidst the subtle joys of nuclear fallout.
The ﬁrst act for The Nitty Gritty Dirt
Band. Suzzy related sadly. they had been
booed at —- which is cause enough to
wonder if the effects of that loose steam
wasn‘t more serious than originally
thought.

What did seem to shake them was the
sudden surge of notoriety they ltave
received. A few weeks back. the NY
'I‘I'Int's' critic called “The Roches" the
linest album of the year. attd other critics
(as does this one) quickly followed suit.
'l‘crre confessed before the show that all
the requests for interviews attd
information were bcgimting to wear on
them. and this seemed to come through in
their performance.

Maggie. 'l‘erre. and Suny have Ito
interest in a public spotlight; if anything. i
it may have been a cause of their initiali
retirement. They are qttick to disarm
most questioncrs with answers that later

that there are tnore important things to
talk about than their music. They have
a knack for asking better questions oflhe
interviewer than they are being asked.
and it is this candor and sincerity that

“Do they)": was Suny‘s frank reply.
“It‘s different every time."

Initially. this scetning lack of
confidence on the part of such bold
performers is a surprise. All performers
put themselves on the line in different
ways. and this must burn up quite a bit of
confidence. yet somehow it seems
unwarranted in performers as
outstanding as The Rocltes.

liut by the satnc token. Maggie. Tcrre.
and Surly take a lot more chances than
your average musician or stage

Despite the disguised way they present
themselves in song. or perhaps because of
it. they bare themselves far more than any

‘ Unique
Rich In

Uneonvcntionality has increasingly
become a-prized commodity amongst the
personaeV of popular music. Indeed,
commodity may be the proper word for
it. as increasingly the qualities and quirks
most artists seize upon to establish their
lndividualism seem adopted. invented.
and ﬁtted-to-size. Thus it is a most
refreshing surprise to come across three
artists whose overwhelming creativity
seems thoroughly an outgrowth of their

individual personalities.
Ken Kwartler

 

There is a communal sense of social
reality to Maggie. Terre. and Suny
Roche which is so strikingly u_nusual.and
yet so sound and direct that it pervades
their music. The Rochcs have a basic
uniqueness about them which is revealed
through their tincolored view of life. an
approach that not only makes them
challenging songwriters. it forces the
listener to reconsider his/ her own
adherence to social custom.

They do not outwardly rail about our
inability to break through the unspoken/
roles that chain us. as did Leonard
Cohen. nor do they bemoan the anguish
it causes. as does Joni Mitchell. Rather.
they seem to rcttder such crises harmless
with a childlike lack of presumption. and
hold them up, to the light for
examination. and ultimately. ridicule.
The anguish and protest emerge. yet they
are buffered by a dry humorand a knife-
sharp wit that can quickly make a tale
fal'cical or frightening. Their reliance on a
highly individual self-expression
concceds little to an inflexible audience.
yet its veracity supports them as they
climb from limb to limb.

They are Maggie and Tcrrc and Sally
Roche. three sisters who come from
deepest New Jersey. Maggie. the eldest.
and Terre. a dtto for ten years. were
discovered by Paul Simon. who
prodttccd their [975 debttt album

out of print. Shortly after its release, the
duo suffered a “severe lack of
confidence,“ and retreated from the
must": scene. ‘ .
Two years ago they were joined by ‘
younger sister Sally. and the three
revived a family tradition of Christmas
earroling through pubs and train

received performances at small Village
nightspots like Folk City and Kenny's
Castaways (and even SUNYA‘s own
Freeze-Dried Coffeehouse). which in
turn led to another recording contract.
The trio‘s first album. The Rocker.
finally emerged last week to much
acclaim. and the Freeze-Dried stayed
open during the first weekend ofvacation
to showcase them again before a standing
room crowd.

lyric. and perfotntancc. Their songs are
two sided blades that cut one way with
humor and the other with perceptiveness;
they lull the listener with simplicity and
then stun with poignancy and sarcasm.
Their music ranges from folk to swing to
ballad. the vocal work from souped-up
jtlll to classical harmony (or all of these
combined. as in a finger-snapping
bebop/Chorale version of Handel‘s
Hallelujah Chorus). Onstage. dressed in

characters in their songs.

 

 

What makes the songs so consistently
effective is the mix of light lyrics and
potent ’ thoughts. The audience - is.
charmed. entertained. and often led to
identification by the innocent portrayal
of a situation. until the identification
becomes too strong. or the words too
clear. and the true power of the song
snaps into place. For example. in
“Damned Old Dog". Maggie laments
