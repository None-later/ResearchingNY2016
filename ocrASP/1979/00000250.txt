player is Mark Btirlingame.

“Mark went to Oneonta State and
he made all-conference. starting
fours years at shortstop. But he
wasn‘t drafted. He went to play in
the Cape Cod league. and he still
wasn't drafted. By a quirk of fate.
the Oneonta Yankees are a farm
club of the New York Yankees. That
was where he went to school. and,
eventually he was drafted.

“He was signed. and lie moved up
to Ft. Lauderdalc. tlte Yankce‘s
triple-A farm eluh, He‘s been
released - he's now working. But he
did play professionally and lie
played for the Yankees. the one team
he wanted to play for. He wore
pinstripes. l was kinda tickled aborrt
that."

In I970. Burlingame was handed
another duty - coordinator of team
transportation. and tltis had an
important impact on his coaching
“The job was for all sports - men‘s
and women‘s. I had to find out Irow
they were going and secure \ehieles
for every learn. It was pretty titne
consuming. With my full load of
teaching. coaching. and transporta-
tion. my recruiting naturally
suffered. I figured ‘Wcll. you can‘t
do everything,‘ So I kinda forgot
about recruiting So I‘ve always been
proud whenever we had any success
because the kids did a good job. It
wasn‘t because I went otrt and got
All-Americans."

Not every aspect of coaching
appeals to Burlingame. Practices. in
his words.“ch to bcadrag."and it's

'cven worse ifthe practice is indoors.

But as far as his favorite part of
coaching. the answer is quick and

“Games. Every game is different.
When I was in college. one of the
questions they asked us in a
coaching course was. ‘Why would
you want to go into coaching?‘ My
answer at that time was because
every game is different. which it is.
You can play 100 games. and no
more than a couple of them will be
alike. My answer in college wasjust
something to put down. but it turned
out to be the truest thing I've ever
said. It's the one thing - the spice at
life. Every season is different. New
faces in every several years. It‘s
variety and it‘s exciting. The desk
work is tough - that's hard work.
Practices are hard work. (iattrcs are
exciting."

Durrng games. Ilur'lingame‘s
baseball knowledge and personality
come together. Arguments with
umpires are rare, Emotional
outbursts are even less frequent. As
in his life. llurlingame takes things in
stride.

“I feel I'm a low key coach.
basically. I think I know my rrrlcs. A
lot of times I hear people get excited
because they don‘t know the rules.
including some coaches. They went
overboard, and they didn‘t cvetr
know the rule. ’l'hey‘re arguing
wrong. If I know the rtrlc. then I get
excited. lint there are many tinrcs
people don't understand the rttlc and
they get excited and ldon‘t. So I try
to keep low key. I think I Irave
a good rapport with the umpires. I
try not to jump all over them. htrt
sometimes you lorget yourself.

"I still get excited for games. to a
point. I try to keep cool. The guys
are playing. I'm not. I can‘t go up
there and get a base hit tor them. I
can't strike anyone out. Ifsomething

goes wrong you tend to blame
yourself. although there's maybe
three or four errors during a game.
physical errors. Mental errors I get
angry about. That's the only time I
get angry at a kid. I don‘t expect
them to make the same mental error
twice. If he makes a physical error. I
won‘t get on his case. and if one of
the other ballplaycrs gets on his
case. then I get on that guy‘s case.

‘l‘hat'sthe one thing I won't stand for.

“I’m not an ulcer coach. I came
close to getting ulcers - I coached
basketball In high school. It's not
worth ruining your health."

In 1973. Albany State's baseball
team won the SUNYAC champion-
ship for the first time III the school's
history. and Burlingame was minted
SUNYAC Coach of the Year. In
contrast to that banner year have
been seasons ol mediocre records.

and also some Iess-than-mediocre
marks. For Burlingame. this is all
part of the job.

“I just like to think of the wins -
the wins are. what sticks with you. I
forget the losses."

“I‘m not 3 Dick Sauers. I won‘t be
one of the top - you won‘t find my
name in the top in the nation.Bultyou
know. for every top guy. there's got
to be a bottom guy. and for every top
and bottom guy. there‘s got to be a
middle guy as far as wins and losses.

“You live once. try to do a good
job at what you do. But don‘t take
yourself too seriously. Some of the
things that happened to me. at the
time they scented pretty serious. but
as I look back on them. they‘re
funny as hell. It's only a game - I do
my best- \vrnning's a helluva lot nicer
tharr losing. believe rrrc. Some days
you get beat - tlrat‘s another reason I
got otrt ol coaching. Excitingasit is.
lleel it the sun is shining on a day. I
want to be able to go out and enjoy

myself because it is a hcatrtiful day.

Whereas I ﬁnd sometimes whenw
get beat. it's a beautiful day here. but
you feeljust like it's pouring inside.
And that's kind of a tough life to live
sometimes. ,

“I found out over 25 years. I‘ve
had a few bad days. but of course.
when you-win. life is beautiful. you
know."

After spending 20 years of his life
in onejob. Burlingame has made the
ties that become so hard to break. “I
can‘t say enough about my fellow
coaches. I think we have an
outstanding coaching staff. We have
a pretty close relgtionship - not as
close as we used to when the school
was small. For instance. mysonis 24
years old. when he sees Dick Sauers
or Joc Garcia. you know what he
calls thenr‘l He doesn‘t call them
coach or anything. He calls them
uncle - Uncle .loe and Uncle Dick.
He sees llill Schieffelin. it's‘Hi Uncle
llill.‘ And he's 24 years old. I
couldn't have asked for better
colleagues. I've been fortunate. I
got to work with people that Icnjoy.

“Yea. oh yea. I would hope I keep
in touch. I‘ll probably ask my son to
send the the Albany scores. I‘ve been
fortunate - it's been a helluva life. I
don't think I missed aday in 20 years
of work. I've got to be pretty lrrcky. I
think being in a job you like has
something to do with it.

“I'll rctirc July lst. and the ninth
ol July is my .‘lllth anniversary. I
would certainly give my wife a lot of
credit for anything that's happened
to me. I think. again. there are a lot
of things that are aggravating in all
jobs. but ill had to do it over. I‘d do
it again. I've been very happy. I
think coaching is generally a really
great life. You'll never make a
million dollars. but you're never
gonna starve to death either. It‘s
been a lot of satisfaction."
