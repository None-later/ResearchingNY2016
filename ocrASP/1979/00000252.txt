DZne Spikers

by Mike Dunne

The ending oflhe 1979 season was
a big disappointment for the Albany
State volleyball team. They lost a‘
playoff match to Cornell on April I7
that was originally scheduled for
early March. The blame for the
initial cancellation and subsequent
rte-scheduling problems fell to the

"administrators of the Cornell

program.

Despite this fact. the delay seemed
to benefit the Ivy—Leaguers as they
bounced back from a mid-season
slump and played themselves into
the Regionals by also defeating Yttle

different story.

last Tuesday.

“The Cornell situation extended
our seasort nearly two weeks and
ruined our tempo as a team." said
Albany volleyball coach Ted Earl.
“If we could have played them
before vacation it might have been a
We were much
sharper then.“

The Dane enrich was not crying
sour grapes. however. as he
acknowledged Cornell’s fine play in
their I6-l4. 15-8. 15-i3 victory.
“The key to the match was that
Cornell passed the ball better than
we did. They are a fine learn.“

Miss Out On Playoffs I

The Big Red then went on to

easily defeat Yale. which only made

things tougher on the Albany
Spikers because they felt they too
could have beaten Yale if only they
had that opportunity.

Albany ﬁnished tip at 13-9 on the
season which would make most
coaches ltappy. However. Earl was
disappointed that his learn didn‘t
win some of their close matches.

“Despite the lotrgh schedule we

played. as a learn we felt we should
ltavc won more games." Earl said.
“We were in all but two matches out
of 23 and because of that we were
disappointed.“
Earl also felt the Albany program
gained in stature this season as laras
their peers in the ECVL are
concerned. The ()pen’I'ournamenl
held here irt March was well run anti
considered a big success by the
league.

lhe hlondc headed Earl. who
insists that his players call him Ted.
cited the team‘s early season match
against Rutgers as altighlighl of the
season. "We felt we cotild beat
them. We‘re the only learn in the
Iiasl that looks forward to playing
them. It was a close match.

Junior hitter (iary Ileeker had
a diflerent idea ofthis seasons hrigltl
spot. “I thought the team tllllly and
spirit was great. Iivcryone tell close
to each other."
