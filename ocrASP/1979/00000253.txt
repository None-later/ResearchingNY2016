The Albany State men's tennis
team defeated Union College by
winning eight out of nine matches.
including all six singles pairings on
the home courts on Wednesday.
Albany now holds a 2-0 record for
the season.

In singles. the Danes were led by
the continuing strong play of their
top four players.‘ Paul Feldman.
Larry Linett. Lane Lerner. and
Mike Fertig. The improving play of
numbers five and six highlighted the
other two singles matches.

In the number one singles match.
Feldman beat Roy Lipson 6-0. 6-1.
but the score doesn‘t indicate the
closeness of the match. Lipson was
able to make many difficult shots
but lost the games on the easier
points. “i missed a lot of easy
volleys.“ Lipson said. " Even when l
was ahead in a point he (Fcldman)
forced me to make good shots."

The other top singles matches
ended with similar scores. Linett
overpowered Jon Epstein 6-3. 6-].
In his match. Lerner took tlteyfirst
set from Jeff Cohen 6-0 but had to
fight to win the second set 6-4.
Similarly. Fertig trounced [)oug
Iierns 6-I in the ﬁrst set bitt could
only edge him 7~6 in the second.
Fertig won a tic-breaker 5~3 to take
his match.

Andy Antoszyk and Derrick
Rubin won their matches as Albany
swept the singles competition. Their
scores were 7-6. 6—4 and 6-3. 6-4.

but finished with scores of6-4 and 6-

We have started using hand signals
between doubles partners like the
Division 1 schools.“

In the number two doubles match.

Fcldman expects that three or
four Danes will be invited to the
nationals this year. “This year could
be the last chance for the team to do
well." Feldmun said. “Mike, Andy,
and lare graduating and Lane may
be transferring.“

Coach Bob Lewis added. "I‘m
recruiting at least one very good
player for next year but we will be
hurt by losing numbers one. four.
and five and number three if he
transfers.“ '
