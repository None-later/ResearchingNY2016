The Albany State men's track and
ﬁeld team has a record of 2-l. but
with a closer look. that mark falls a
bit sh'ort as far as satisfaction. On
Wednesday, the Danes put together
a strong team effort in defeating
Plattsburgh. 97-53. but that only
added to the frustration.

In the squad‘s ﬁrst meet of the
spring season. a tri-meet with RPI
and Hartwick. Albany held a
seemingly solid seven point
advantage going into the ﬁnal
event—the javelin. RPI took ﬁrst.
second and fourth. but the clir‘tcher

i was the third place spot. It went to

Hartwick. giving them their only

two points in the entire meet. Those

points were also badly needed by

Albany. and- without them. the

Danes were passed by RPI and

dropped the meet. 95-94.

“We gave RPI the meet." said

Albany assistant track coach Ron
White. “We had letdowns in spots
where we shouldn't have. We had a
chance to win it. The first meet of
the season is always tough.and ifit‘s
close. one team has to get burnt. We
got burnt. We could go against RPI
any other day in the season and beat
them by 20 points. They knowitand
we know it."

The Danes regrouped to smash
I’lattsburgh. with nine first placc
finishes. Jim Pollard. wlto was
labeled "the standout of the tncet by
White. won two individual events.
came in second in one. and was part
of a winning 440 relay team.

"It was a tri-meet. but Hartwick

Baseball.has been a part of Bob
Burlingame’s life for as long as he
am remember. As a player,
spectator and most especially as a
coach, he has embraced the sport of
baseball with a fervor that many
witness, but few truly feel. I

At Albany State. Burlingame has
been active in growing athletic
programs since I959. Through all
his duties. the one that gives‘tiim the
greatest satisfaction — his passion in
life - is his title of "coach" for the
Albany State baseball team. Now.
20 years later. Burlingame has
decided to make this spring his last
at Albany. and will make his way to
Florida with his wife Nancy for his
retirement. .

“I just had the feeling that life was
short." Burlingame said. “Variety is
the spice of life. I thought 25 total
years of coaching baseball was
. . probably enough. I felt. in my
I lifetime."

Despite his long tenure in Albany.
.' ,; Burlingamc really was not planning

' on working or settling in Albany at
all. He grew up in New .lerscy. but in
his sophomore year of high school.
he moved to New York City. Far
from a lover of school at the time.

“I was on I] different ships."
Burlingame recalls. “I wasn‘t in the
thick of things. but Idid have a few
exciting moments. The closest I was
to being shook up was in Belgium. It
was the latter part of the war. when
they started with the buzz bombs.
We had cargo on a refrigerated ship —
we were taking it to Antwerp — and
that was under attack. You know.
you could hear them. and then it
would stop. and then you would
start worrying when you heard
motors stop. because that meant
they were close. The ground would
shake a little bit and things would
fall." I
After his time in the navy.‘
Bu'rlingame realized that he wanted
to go to college. However. there was
one problem - getting accepted. “I
couldn‘t get into college. even
though I had a wartime diploma. So
a friend of mine took me out to
Colgate. but they said I would have
to go back to high school for one
year. if you want it that bad,bccausc
I was 23 years old. I said I would give
it a try — I was never too good of a
high school student. The mart at
Colgate told me I would have to do a
lot better than I did before in high
school.

“I went up to Cambridge. New
York. a little town. where my
mother was at the time. and went
back to school for a year and got all
A's and B's. Two funny things about
that—I was older than my English
teacher-and shc happcncd to be a
graduate

Jrcminisccnt smile. Burlingame looks

naturally I got an A in that course.

back.‘ “Oh God. I guess I started in
baseball when I was a kid. I played
ball all through high school. I
thought I was a pretty good
ballplaycr. I don‘t think I was a
professional prospect. but I was
always a good solid ballplayer."
Actually. I played until I was 44.

To have someone say on the way out,

“Say gee coach,you’ve got a nice bunch of boys"

makes me feel good. It’s worth it.
Especially when they had

Then Idecided lwas too old for this
stuff."

Burlingame entered Colgate when
he was 24. and was married the next
year. After two years for his masters.
it was time to look forajob. Now 30.
Burlingame had a late start in life.
but still was determined to stay
associated with baseball. His ﬁrst
job was coaching high school
baseball in St. Johnsville. N.Y.. a

post he held for five years. Then. ,

there was the urge to inch on. and
that urge. combined with a quirk of
fate. brought Burlingamc to Albany.
' “I had gotten a job at Norwich
Iligh School. It was a bigger school
than St. Johnsvillc. and it looked
like a beautiful job. A fclla from the
state department. a friend of mine.
came through town. and he said ‘I
heard you're Ieaving.‘ I said ‘yca. I
got a good job - I think it's a dandy-

    
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 

   

bttt I kind of wish I was going into a
collegejob. He said “Albany State is
looking for a baseballcoach.'Wcll. I
applied. had a few telephone
conversations with Merlin
Hathaway. he was our old athletic
director. and ﬁnally one day

towards the end of the summer. I
just got on the phone and I called
President Collins. and I said. ‘Gce.

 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
     
    
   
     
     
    
     
      
      
      
  
  

I'd love to come to Albany for an
interview.‘ Time was winding dowu
and I really was trying to get an
answer. That‘s when they told me I
was one of the ﬁnal applicants-l
think there were a total of 6i
applicants. And the president said
c‘mon ahead. And as fate would
have it. Joe Garcia was minding the

interview to go over to a place on
Central Ave. to get a coke or
something. Seemed like two minutes
later Joe came over and got me and
brought mc back to the president's
office. and as I walked in the door hc
said 'congratulations coach.”

As the sixth tncmher 'of the
athletic faculty. Iiurlingume
inherited a baseball program that
had “a couple of pretty good
individual players. and a team that
they considered to be a pretty good
ballclub.“ But coaching baseball
was not his only responsibility.
Burlingame also was the ﬁrst
coordinator of freshman athletics.
and was in charge of scheduling for
all freshman teams. In addition. he
was the coach of freshman soccer
and wrestling.

As expected. things were quite
different in Albany 20 years ago.and

Albany by way of Burlinytme‘a
determination. His team's

some of the top baseball teams in the
east, has been dramatically
upgraded. “It has come a long way.r
Burlingame proudly says. "People
wouldn't have looked at us years
ago."The ﬁrst fall baseball game for
Albany was in_ 1968. and it still holds
a special memory for Burlingame.
“We went over to play the
University of Massachusetts.
George Webb-his brother Hank
pitched for the 4 Mots-was our
pitcher. Well. George gave them one
run over ﬁve innings. and then lhad
to relieve him. and then my ﬁrst
baseman hit a two run ltomer.
Massachusetts had been to the
Nationals the year before. Division

little angry. and they beat us l44).or
something like that. in the second
game. But we. little Albany. took a
school like Massachusetts and beat
them. That was in our ﬁrst fall
baseball game.
As a coach. Burlingame has
experienced many things. When
speaking to him. a feeling of '
closeness is present when one subject
is touched upon '- the coach and his
players.
“Some of the satisfactions of
coaching are. for my money. the
relationships with players. I've gone
to a number of weddings of my
former players. The ties are still
there. .

make sure our games got done by

really a good bunch. but that's the
one thing about my clubs that I can
honestly say.. It's been the type of
kids that really make itajoyto work
with. Generally speaking it‘s been a
helluva bunch of guys - been fun to
work with. I‘ve new been a big
recruiter - I‘ve probably only
recruited four or ﬁve guys in my 20
years. Therefore. I though if I went
out and recruited. some of these
people wouldn‘t be playing ball. But
they've been the type of kid that‘s
been great to work with. I‘ve enjoyed
that. I‘ve had people - always on
road trips. at restaurants and so
forth - come over and say ‘Gec.

they didn‘t have to say that. So it
must be true. because I‘ve heard it so
many times. We'd go in asa baseball
club. and to have someone say on

got a nice bunclt of boys' makes me
feel good. It‘s worth it. Especially
when they had blalcrs on that said
