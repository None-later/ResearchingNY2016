Dramatic Comeback Lifts Batmen

Trailing 6.2, Albany _
Gains Second Spring Win

by Paul Schwartz

Things were not look'ing
particularly bright for the Albarty
State baseball team yesterday at
RPI. It was already the seventh
inning. and the Danes trailed the
Engineers. 6-2. "They were getting
every break early in the game." said
Albany baseball coach Bob
Burlingame. “Things looked pretty
bad." .

Well.thingsgotalotbetter.andin
a hurry. With.thrcc runs in the
eighth inning. and two more in the
ninth. the Danes fought back and
defeated RPI 7.6. to improve their
spring record in 2—0.

"It was a great comeback "‘said
Burlingiimc. “That is the sign of
a good team. We didn‘t play really
well. but we got what we needed. It
wtfs a thriller."

In tlte eighth. Dave Peck started
the Albany comeback by singling.
“Willie Flynn reached base on an
error. and Andy Dym's groundout

.prtiduced Albany's third run. The
Danes loaded the bases. and Bruce
Rollins then hit a sinking drive to
centerfield. With the wind blowing
in and the runners moving. the

Danes came up with two runs.
Wayne Flynn tried to score on the
play. but was thrown out at the plate
and Albany still trailed 6-5.

Rich Woods. who came on to
pitch In the seventh inning in place
of Mike Clabeaux. sent the
Engineers down in the eighth. and
Albany had their last chance.

With one out in the ninth.
designated hitter Mike Mirabella
walked. and Peck singled to put'
runners on ﬁrst and second.
Pinchhitter Mike George walked.
and then the Danes got what
Burlingamc called-“the biggest
break of the game.“ Dym hit a
ground ball to the second baseman.
who could have tagged George
heading towards second. and
possibly could have turned a double
play.

Instead. the RI’I fielder threw
home to cut down the run. btit the
throw was too late. and Mirabella
crossed the plate with the tying run.
(iarv McCarthy‘s sacrifice flv
brought home the go-trhcad rttn. and
the pressure was now on Woods to
stop the Engineers.

The first batter for RPl in the
bottom of the ninth caused perhaps
the most controversial play of the
game. He hit what looked to be a

'double. but as he went for second he

hesitated. and then charged for the
base. George and the RPI
bascrunner both dove for the base.
and the call went in Albany‘s
favor the runner was out.

“It could have gone either way."
llurliiigame said. “When you play
on the road. you really don‘t expect
that call to go your way.“

Woods then grit the next batter to
ground out. then walked an RN
hitter. but finished the Engineers
witlt a fly to Wayne Flynn in -

“Rich did real well in the relief."
llurlingame said. “It‘s tough to
come in in relief. especially when it‘s
windy and cold. He was as tough as
he had to be."

On Monday. the Danes opened
up their season by trouncing Union
l5-2. Albany rocked three Union
pitchers for l4 hits and Ed Sellers
and Bruce Dey combined strong

pitching performances to silence the
Dutchmen bats. Albany was
scheduled for three contests before
Union. but poor weatltcrcauscd the
games to be postponed.

“I was wondering how sharp we

would be for Union.“ said

‘Burlingame. "l was really surprised

we hit the ball as well as we did.“

Albany jumped out to a quick 34)
lead in the first inning with the help
of some powerful but work. Wayne
Flynn led off with a triple, and
immediately scored the first Dane
run of the spring campaign on an
overthrow. After designated hitter
George tripled. Chris Siegler sent a
long drive over the fence in left-

Albany‘s half of that inning

Albany held a b-l lead.

The Danes put together a four-

“It was the first day out. and I
think our pitchers did a good job.“

almost every inning. bill they were
well scattered hits."

Struggling Stickmen Stagger To First Victory

by M..l. Memmott

The Albany State lacrosse team
chalkyd up its first victory of the
season Wednesday afternoon by a
l3-li margin mer thi: visiting
Potsdam State Bears. A masterful
game it was not. as both teams did
their best to help the other side.

"If it had been any other team
than Potsdam. we wouldn‘t have
won.“ Dane coach Mike Motta said
after the game. "We've played much
better gatncs this year and lost.“

Albany struck first in the game.
but Potsdam lost no time in
responding to the challenge. Itcar
attackman Mike Donnelly scored
the ﬁrst of his three goals to knot the
game at one tally apiece. and then
assisted on the score that pttt his
team in front 2Al.

The Danes. however. weren't
going to let the Bears blow them off
the field nitieli like the blustery vyind
threatened to do.

Attackman Bill Schmohl put in a
shot from right in front of Potsdam
goalie Kevin Sherry. and then his
fellow attttckman Dave llcnedctto
started off his one mart barrage with
a breakaway goal. Benedetto went
on to score six goals for the game.

Albany started the second quarter
holding a 3-2 advantage. but the
Danes proved right away they

weren‘t content to stop there. (In the
opening faccoff attackman John
Nelson scored on a quick
breakaway feed from Sclnnolil to

put the Danes up 4—2.

Images of a first half iotit were
erased almost immediately from the
minds of the Albany stickmen.
however. as the Danes hobbled the
ball dccp iti their own lone to set tip
Potsdam for an easy goal moments
after the Nelson score. Then. with
Albany playinga mar. uhort because
of a holding pcnalt). . the licars
scored again to tie the game at four.

The lead changed hands like the

until Albany finally ended tip with a
7-6 lead when the horn sounded. It
looked like whichever team that
decided it no longer wanted to play
givc~tt\v:ty would be able to take the
second half and the game.

In the cod. though. botli teams
stuck with their rather sloppy game.
fortunately for the Danes. goalie
Ken 'l'irman had an excellent second
half. coming up with some crucial

-

saves. Fortunately for 'l'irrntin:
Potsdam preferred to hit the posts
holding tip the out rather than
putting the ball inside it.

“'l'irman had a real good garlic."

Motta said. “He had 23 saves for thc

‘ day. llut Potsdam also just didn't

have any luck. 'l'licy intist have had
five or six goals bounce off the
posts."

Benedetto started the second half
off for the Danes. and Schmohl

followed that tally up with one of his
own. Then rittackman Mark
Watcrstram scored the first of his
two goals on a shot from the side.
that Schmohl assisted on with a
pretty pass from behind the net.

Donnelly brought the liears back
to within three goals of the Danes.
before Schmolrl and Watcrstraru
combined on art exact duplicate of
their earlier score to end the third
quarter wrth Albany leading ll-7.

The final quarter saw Benedetto
score twice forthe Danes. the second
goal coming after a great save by
'I'irman which the goalie carried to
midfield before passing off to
Ilenedetto.

"I guess we were iust a little bit
stronger across the board than
Potsdam was.“ Motta said. “Our
attack played real well offensively.
btit overall it wasn't a very good
game for us."

The Danes record now stands at
one win and five losses. Over the
spring recess. they lost to Rochester
Institute of ’I'cchnology ll-4.
Cortland State 20—9. and to
Ilroekport State l2-‘).

“We played real good against
Cortland. but they‘re such a good
team that it was pretty rough for us
against them.“ Motta said. Cortland
is ranked in the top ten of Division I
and II schools across the rtation.

Albany's next game is Saturday
afternoon against (ieneseo State. at
the lacrosse field behind Dutch
Quad. Game tirrie is 2:00 pm.

SUN Y Lawyer To File Lawsuit

by Michele Israel

SUNYA l..-ga| Services lawyer

Jack Lester will file a lawsuit against
SUNY officials on scieral charges.
stemming from lltc student sit-in at
SllC Purchase late last week.

Lester will be filingI complaints
against Purchase President Michael
Hammond. SUNY Chancellor
Wharton. and the members of the
SUNY Board of Trust . The
charges include misrepresentation
and breach of contract.

According to SASU Vice-
prcsidcnt for Campus Affairs lorry
Mullins. I’rcsidcnt Hammond has
opted for a change in the college's
ncadetttic calendar. turning the In
wcck semester in to it IS week
program. lhc original in week
semester is divided into l2 week and
loirr week intcrvuls.

lhc l’urchttsc Sit-in was
precipitated by the arrest of twcnty-
the student members, of St.
Valentine's ('oalition. a group
formed to protest Hammond‘s Feb.
l4 proposal tluit the university

calendar be altered.

After ninctccn til the coalition
members were arrested. one
hundred students held an all-night
sit In at the SUC Purchase
Administration building. risking for
amnesty for the arrested students
and for the formation of a
governance board to discuss the
proposed changes in the academic

' calendar.

According to Mullins. Hammond
threatened to phone the police to the
scene. but was interrupted by the
arrival of six faculty members who
supported the students.

Lester said that he was contacted
by Purchase students who were
seeking to find a way to stop the
proposed calendar changes.

"lhcr‘c has been a breach of

'contract." said Lester. “And the
administrators have also broken a
statutory la w. which states that w hat
is presented to students in written
lorru. as in a brochure. will lltlltl
true."

Lester said that students had been

led to believe that the sixteen w'cck
semester would be the calendar
followed. and that an attempt to
alter that calendar amounted to
rtttst‘cpt’cscrttalion.

SASU President Steve Allinger
said that be pressured Hammond for
"leniency" for the arrested students.
Allinger and a group of'studcnts met
with Hammond and agreed on
creating a govut'nance board to
discuss the prOpt)M:d changes. The
board will consist of nine students.

‘here were three. It differs each
year,” said Feldman.

The candidates, Steve
Coplon, Sharon Ward, Scott
Lonsberry, Lenny Harrison.
Mark Borkowski, Phil Meltzer.
and Lisa Newmark, have laun-
ched extensive campaigns with
posters and door-to-door visits.
The campaigns are not spon-
sored by SA, but funded by the
candidates themselves. Most
agreed that the campaigns cost
“too much” running from $125
to $300.

Feldman said that SA has
never funded election cam-
paigns. but that it is an issue to
consider. “Campaigns have
become more expensive over the
years. Posters used to be
xeroxed, costing each candidate
about $20. Perhaps the question
of public financing should be
looked at." said Feldman.

He further added that there is
a “regulation . system. How
much money does each can-

didate set? How many posters I
