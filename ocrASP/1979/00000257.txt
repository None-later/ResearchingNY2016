Knight and his wife told this
story of their trip to Tashkent:
They were taken — sup-
posedly for a “party” —— to a

tea-house on the edge of
Tashkent by a man who said he
was an lntourist guide. They
were greeted by three men who
said they were guides, and two
young women.

The group plied the Knights
with vodka during the 2 l/2
hour wait for food. Knight said
he drank a little but that his wife
does not like vodka and does
not drink.

When the food arrived, new
glasses were used, from which
Knight drank and his wife did
not. He immediately left the
room feeling strange, feel down
on a patio, violently ill, and

Mrs. Knight said that §S'soon

to hysically force her to drink
her glass, then began molesting
her sexually when she refused.
She ran screaming from the
room and found her husband
lying unconscious outside. For
40 minutes she tried to revive
him, without help from their
hosts, who stood and watched.
Then an empty lntourist bus
drove up and took them to their
hotel. At the hotel, militiamen
tried to drag her still-
unconscious husband away but

After some difﬁculties Mrs.
Knight said, she managed to
telephone ’the American em-
bassy in Moscow. Eventually
she was allowed to take him,
still unconscious, to the room.
She said she later was able to
arrange a ﬂight to Moscow for

recovered.

Oil Companies May Be

WASHINGTON (AP) Scn-
timcnt is building in Congress
for a windfall profits tax on oil
revenues. but President Carter
fears the ultimate beneficiaries
will be the oil companies.

Carter said Monday op-
ponents of his proposal to
divert additional oil profits to
new energy-related programs
are trying to pull off a
"Charade" that will create $4
billion to $5 billion in tnorc oil
company profits.

The president has announced
he will use his administrative
authority to decontrol oil prices
beginning June 1 and is urging
Congress to approve a windfall
profits tax to help~exploit new
energy sources. fund mass tran-
sit. and help the poor pay rising
utility and fuel bills.

His plan would levy a 50 per-
cent tax on new revenues that
result front decontrols.

The proposed tax has met
with a mixed reception in the
l'lousc and Senate, but Carter
said opponents have begun a
campaign “to hoodwink the
American people by passing a
windfall profits tax that is in
fact a charadc."

(‘ar’cfully avoiding any op-
porrcnts' names, Carter said in a

Getting Most‘From Tax

Academy of Sciences that he an-
ticipates efforts to pass an
amendment that would “kick-
back” to the companies $4
billion to $5 billion on top of
the estimated $6 billion they
would realize in extra profits
under his plan.

Such a plowback proposal
would require companies to
turn added profits to
discovering new oil fields or
developing existing reserves.

Sen. Russell Long, chairman
of the Senate Finance Commit-
tee and a key influence on tax
matters, has said he would
favor a windfall profits levy,
but only after sufficient time
elapses to see how oil producers
use higher profits from decon-

trols.

An aide to the Louisiana
Democrat said the senator
would not comment on Carter's
speech. Meanwhile, the idea of
a windfall profits tax received a
boost from different sides ofthe

‘aisle —— Senate Minority Leader

Howard Baker and Sen. Henry
Jackson, D-Wash., chairman of
the Senate Energy (‘otttrnittec.

Baker said the president “cart
have the windfall profits tax for
the asking. . . l‘m hard—pressed
to find anyone who's opposed
toil."

Jackson, interpreting (.‘ar—
tcr's speech as an attack on
Congress, said he would
strongly support the tax
proposal.

“The president should not
blame Congress. however, for
windfall profits to the oil com-
panies. This is backwards,"
Jackson said.
