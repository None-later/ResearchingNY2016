Fink Having Thoughts ,
About Legalized Gambling

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) Assem-
bly Speaker Stanley Fink, until
now the Legislature’s strongest
advocate of legalized casino
gambling. said Monday he is
having “second thoughts"
about the idea.

Fink told a news conference
that he was worried by the
report of a study panel last week
which found that New York
might gain no more than $150
million to $200 million in an-
nual tax revenues from casino

McManus added that many
people don't have the protec-
tion ofa credit card.

“We attd the FTC are
probably trying to achieve the
same thing. they'rejust taking a
different route to do it," he
said.

gambling -- not much in the
face of a budget approaching
$13 billion.

The speaker further under-
mined casino gambling’s chan-
ces by saying he was still stan—
ding firm in his position that the
casinos should be run by the
state, not by private business.

The Legislature last year gave
first passage to three possible
constitutional amendments
legalizing casino gambling. It
now must choose between them
if an amendment is to be put
before the people in a referen-
dum this fall.

Fink has been an advocate of
the amendment which could
provide for state operation of
casinos. He has held that that
would be the best way of
reducing the inﬂuence of
organized critne.

But the special study panel,
appointed by Gov. Hugh Carey,

said last week that private
operation would be better. That
was a position already em-
braced by the Republican-
controlled Senate and by the

I

Democratic governor.

Fink, a Democrat. said that
he had seen "nothing" in the
report to comvince him to
change his mind on that issue.

5, 000 Battle Police;
Protect Election Rally

LONDON (AP) About 5.000
demonstrators battled police
protecting an election rally
Monday of the right-wing
National Front. which wants to
end non-white immigration to
Britain. Police said one demon-
strator was killed.

Authorities said 40 persons,
including 16 policemen, were
hospitalized after the clashes in

the London suburb of Southall,
where racial violence has'flared
in recent years.

The dead man was identified
as Blair Peach, a New Zealand
schoolteacher. Police said he
died of severe head injuries and
termed the death suspicious.
They declined further comment.

Peach, about 37 years old,
was identified as one of the
demonstrators. It was not clear

whether he was struck by police '

officers or hit while a barrage of
bricks and bottles was being

- thrown by demonstrators.

Two ofﬁcers were reported in
serious condition with knife
wounds.

Police ofﬁcials said more
than 300 persons. including
many blacks and Asians, were
arrested at the city hall rally
site.

It was the most violent in-
cident in the campaign for the
May 3 national elections and the
second biggest battle involving
the National Front. On Satur-
day, 30 policemen were injured
as they fought protesters trying
to stop an authorized march by
Front members in Leicester,
central England.

fectively by being rational and
level headed instead of yelling
and screaming.”

“SA needs to be brought
back to the students," said
Scott Lonsbcrry from Alumni
Quad, who calls himself an un-

derdog.
Lousberry foresees long tertn
planning and improved

management as his goals as SA
president. He suggested setting
up capital improvement funds
as a way to maintaitt stability in
the SA budget.

The allocation and budget of
student tax are the main issues
that Lenny Harrison from Dut-
ch Quad will be dcaling with in
his plans for SA president.
“Corners can be Cut and ways
to save money must be taken
care of," said Harrison.
Harrison expressed the problem
of wastage in the SA Contact
Office concerning the excessive
use of the copy service by SA
members.

Phil Meltzer, of Indian Quad,

said that his candidacy stems

from a dislike of the candidates’
campaigns.
“I'm not running to Witt. I’m

running to make a point. I’m
tired of all the posters and
slogans. I want to stop the
bullshit. SA elections have
become a circus," said Meltzer.

Meltzer said that most
students are not fully aware of
the goals of the candidates,
stating that they are attracted by
slogans. “It’s how ntuclt money
and how many posters they've
had, not what they've done."

Campaigns should be more
informative, explained Meltzer.
He suggested that the can-
didates’ goals should be viewed
in full. as on a radio forum.

“Policies should be made
known in another way so that
not only those who are involved
with- student government are
‘ aware of the candidates’ in-

volvement. I don’t want to take
votes from people who are
aware ofthe issue. I want to at-
tract people who don’t care and
are attracted by a slogan,” said
Meltzer.

The candidates feel that they
are being supported from all
areas of the school and that they
have good chances of winning.
