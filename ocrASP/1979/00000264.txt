victory Sunday in the prestigious
Tournament of Champions.an elite
event that brings together the
winners of PGA Tour titles from the
past l2 months.
“He‘s the greatest player.“
. Watson said. “He‘s not playing very
well right now and I know he must
be burning inside. But he‘ll be back.
He‘s too great a player not to.“

Watson. a dedicated sttidcnt of

the game. mentioned some of ilie
greats of the past: Bobby Jones.

Walter Hagen, Gene Sararen. Ben
Hogan. Byron Nelson and the more
current stars. including Gary Player.
But he came back to Nicklaus.
(“Jack‘s record is

Fred Lynn Predicts A
Great Season If Healthy

BOSTON (AP) Centcrfielder
Fred Lynn, who has clouted
seven home runs in helping the
Boston Red Sox get off to a
flying start in the American
League East, says maybe he’ll
get 30 before the season ends.
It's just a matter of staying
healthy.

“I believe I can have a great
season if I'm healthy." says
Lynn, who has hit iii ll straight
games this season. .

The young outfielder. now in
his fifth major league season,
wore a knee brace duritig spring
training iii Florida after twisting
his ktiec. He still wears the
brace, btit shows no signs of
weakness at the plate.

Besides leading the AL iii
homers, Lynn sports a battering
average of .340 and has driven
in 15 runs. He has also bating
out a pair of doubles.

“I don‘t even think about
how many homers I might hit."
the 6’1". l90-pounder said
rccetitly. "Thirty would be nice.

but I’m not going to get some of
the hanging breaking balls and
high fastballs I’m getting now
all season.

Lynn wasn’t healthy in 1977.
a year he found himself plagued
with injuries. However. he
bounced back last season,
finishing with a .298 average
and 22 homers. His only major
medical problem was a stomach
injury, forcing him to miss five
games in August, a month he
averaged only .218.

His fast start this year has
aided the Red Sox to a 9-4
record. a game ahead of the
New York Yankees. The team
has collected a total of l9
homers.

Lynn’s first five homers this
year catnc off the Cleveland Iti-
dians, prompting Cleveland
Manager Jeff Torborg to say at
the end of a three-game series at
Fenway Park in Boston: “We
don't see him for a while?
Good. Maybe he'll cool off by
then."
