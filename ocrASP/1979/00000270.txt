Ireland has intensified and hccomca

Most observers think Mrs.
Thatcher‘s spccchcs bcl‘orc ticket-
only audiences reflect her manager's
privately cxprcsscd view that there is
little to be gained in exposing her to
shouting matches with trade union
men in village litills.

Hcr message that she will lead
Britain out of Labor‘s “drab. grcy

world of socialism" into an era of

free enterprise. lower taxes and
restored prestige abroad gets more
television cowragc than Callaghan
docs anyway.

Callaghan holds the old-style
evening meetings forall. but because
of security they arc not pitblici/cd.
