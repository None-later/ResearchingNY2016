local libraries ha \‘e been stripped at
all books on ttuclear energy. attd
(ioycrnor Richard 'l'ltornburgh has
set tip a rumor—control center in
efforts to stop misinl'orntation from
being spread.

According to the neuspaacr.
tircartns stores in Mitldletonn are
selling out ot amtnunition. and

people \\ ho hate never owned guns
before are buying them.

The newspaper quotes one

reason for the record sales in

Stapleton: “You‘\e got people who
are concertted  they can't see
