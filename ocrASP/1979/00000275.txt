which you may never use.

But that‘s how travelling in Europe is.
Each person who has gone there for a
summer has come away with a different
experience. To one. the hash bars of
Amsterdam are more memorable than its
canals. To another. the beer halls of
Munich may mean more than that city's
beautiful bells.

But there is the common bond of
having travelled in the countries which
spawned our own. of having seen how
another part of the world operates. and
how it‘s people live.

Of having been in Europe for the

potholes get even bigger and are more
widespread. a Volksiyagon doesn't stand

And after a wet winter‘s day. the roads
become so dirty that the muck which

muck has to be chiseled off.

Then there ‘s the Trojans that‘s what

Indeed. there may really be changes in

the police. and the government is
carinarking funds for renovations.

At a corner on River Street. nca r the
