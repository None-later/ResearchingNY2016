An Islander Fan Remembers Seven Short Years

Islanders improved their rccord.ttnd
were the only team to win games
from Montreal in the playoffs. Some
felt they had become tltc second best
tcatn itt the NHL.

'l‘hen. finally. last year. they won
their first division title. The defense
had always- been solid. but the past
three yca rs saw tltc arrival ofquality
forwards. who could carry tltc puck
out of tltc Ionc.and s'corc. To prove
their ttcw punch. they became tltc
first tcatn to have five JO-gonl

'scorcrs. But. itt lltL‘ playoffs they

were beat up and upset by Toronto.

So then. this is it. The year to
prove tltettt‘.cl\'cs as champs. They
came back strong during the regular
season no less than tltc best
record in tltc league. All sorts of
individual tnarks leading scorer.
leading goal scorer. leading
defensive scorer . . . llut the
playoffs are a dil'lcrcnt game.

A loss to New York would he a
loss of New York. And two
successive years of npscts could
hatch tltc beginnings of a "choke
tradition" similar to their
counterparts. llut that‘s getting
ahead of tltc story.

the Islanders have tttadc progress
durtng every year ol their history.
llnt this )Cttl they‘re expected to
make a run lor lhe (’up. wlticlt
means getting mto tltc finals. And
tltc}'\c ncvct' gotten past tltc
scttttlittal round.

Approptialcly. their opponcnts
atc tltc Rangers. tltc lirst teattt llIL')
c\ct played and heat llt tltc playoll’s.
And llttlltlll:ltlll)‘.tllltl cscitittgly. tltc
Rangers are also good, (iood
enough to heat Montrcalduring tltc
season‘s scrtes good enough to
also \\ttt the Cup. it you believe that

Sonny Wurbl'tn can crass: tradition
stntply by making some trades and
waving his pocketbook at a great

coach attd a couple 0! loteigttcts. I

believe. however. that tradition is
lorcwr. and besides. the Islanders
arc-just too good,

The "Spinner Spencer" banners
arc gone. And l‘fddic Westl'all will
soon play his last game. And Hilly
lla rris is tto longer their biggest snt r.
last night they started their lonrth
semifinal playoll series ltt tltc past
ltvc yea rs. lr'avorcd to win.

Within a tnontlt. it is possible that
captain Clark (iillies will take a
victory lap around tltc ice. holding
Lord Stanley‘s Cup aloft. It would
he tltc cultttination of a seven-year
plan that tltc Russians could be
proud of. So take heart. Ranger
fans. if the Islanders rlo romp over
tltc Ranger ttpstarts in tltc battle of
New York.
