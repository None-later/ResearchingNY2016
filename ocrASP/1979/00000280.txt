~ Batmen Find TheyRoad A Tough Place To Play

by Mike Dunne

On three long road trips which
took them to Syracuse. Vermont
and Onconta the Albany State

baseball teams had some problems.
They played a total of'five games ina
four day period managing just orte
\‘ictory'.

That lone triumph came iii the
first ganie of a doubleheader with
Hartwick in Oneonta last Tuesday.
Senior Ed Sellersl2—l) tossed a six-
lritter leading tlte Danes to a come
froln beltind 5-3 win. He wertt all
seven innings gelling five Httrtwick
batters on strikeouts.

"I wrts pleased with Ed ‘s'
pitching." said Albtiny coach liob
Btirlingamc. “He certaittly pilclted
well enough to win. The three runs
he gave up were unearned. He ltad
pitched shutouts tlte last two seasons
against them."

The Danes opened the scoring iii
tlte first inning wltcn specdster
Wayne Hyitn look it rrpon ltiriiself

another steal and crossed the plate
on a catcher‘s error.

innings.

his third base of the game.
Advancing to third on a wild pitch.
Flynn scored when the llartwick

In the second game Hartwick
pitching handcuffed the Danes on
only two hits in a J-l victory.
The opposing pitclter was not

hitters to fly otit on tett oce sions.
lltirlingame talked about this factor.

The big hit iii the third inning was
it two run triple by Dane catcher
Mike Mirabella which knocked in
both Willie Flynn and Gary

It didn‘t take tnuch longer for
Middlebury to show their hitting
strength. 'l'ltcy knocked out Albany

A BANY

Albany Wins Despite First
SUNYAC Loss For Feldman

by David Osborn

Paul Fcldman has been so
dominant over his four year tenure
on the Albany State men's tennis
team that he has reached the stage
where the only big concern comes
when he loses. In 90 matchesduring
his college career that has only
happened to the scraggly-curled
senior I2 times.

The most recent of the dozen
mishaps came Wednesday
afternoon at flinghamton in the
SUNY Center Championships.
With a sore left shoulder that
hampered both his serve and
