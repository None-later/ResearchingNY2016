Endorsement Tactic “Unethical”

'by Michele Israel

SA President Paul Feldman
deemed one Credit Union member's

'cndorsemen't of "SA,,presidential

candidate Stcvc €oplon its
"unethical." The Union should
maintain integrity and l'air play."
said Feldman.

FelIdman‘s statement was nude in
response to the actions _::.' Credit
Union Board member Brian
Furlong. who phoned approxi-
mately 25' union members last
'l'lrursday. asking them to support
Steve Coplon.

judgment.“ said Feldman. “Gr0ups
shouldn‘t be involved with a conflict
of interest. such as supporting
specific candidates. The 'Credit
Union is a student service: students
shouldn't be hassled on the phone
and told who to choose.“ '
Furlong said he called the
nicrrioers. stating that Coplon was
not involved Willi the endorsement.
He also said that be told membersto
support Coploii beertusc he had
riiade commitments to the union
while he “hadn‘t heard ol‘any other
candidates making commitments in

formed. I didn't slander anyone."

said Furlong.

Credit Union‘s President Ron
Ninikoff said he did not feel
Eurlong‘s acts were unethical. “The
lists of members used by Furlong
were legal." as stated in SA
regulations and in the regulations of
the” National (.‘r'edit Union
Association (NC 1A).“

Feldiiian' said he had been "told"
that incorrect information was being
given to the members. The
information stated that Coplon was
the only candidate who supported

 

the Credit Union.

One uriioii member who wits
contacted said l’iir'lorrg did not
speak against any other candidates.

(‘oplori said he isaequainted with
members ol the irriiori who are
rnvolsed with the campaign. “i told
them that if they did support me. it
should be done legally. l condemn
