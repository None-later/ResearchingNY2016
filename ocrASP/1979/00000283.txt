'Irbn  Ordered To Cut
Relations With Egypt

ITEHRAN. Iran (AP) Revolution-

ary leader Ayatollah Khomeini
ordered that Iran cut its diplomatic
relations with Egypt on Monday.
state radio reported. Egypt
responded by summoning its
diplomats home. ‘ ‘
Khomeini's reported move was

- made in support of the Arab nations

that have severed ties with Cairo in
retaliation for Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's signing of a peace
treaty with Israel. Almost all of
Sadat's fellow Arabs have
condemned the peace pact.

The rcvolutiona ry regime in non-
Arab but staunchly Mosletn Iran
has expressed strong backing for the
Palestine Liberation ()rgani/ation
and for Arab demands for the return

of Israeli-occupied lands. including
East Jerusalem and its Moslem holy
sites. "

Iranian revolutionaries were
angered. too. when Sadat played
host to Shah Mohammad Rem
Phalavi for a' few days ihidlanuary
after the monarch lied lran and went
into exile in the face of mounting
oposition to his rule. '

An Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman said he could neither
confirm or deny the reported break.
but sources close the Prime Minister
Mehdi Halargan's' Cabinet said an
announcement on the matter would
probably be made Tuesday by the
Khomeini-appointed provisional
government.

In another development. Iranian

 

authorities look new steps toward
reducing the vigilante atmosphere in
much of Iran. issuing orders that
persons considered incapable of
handling weapons be disarmed.

Sources in the office of Public
Prosecutor Mehdi Hadavi said strict
orders also were issued to
prosecutors in the provinces to stop
the illegal sale and smuggling of
weapons.
