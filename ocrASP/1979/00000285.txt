ALBANY STUDENT PR

CONFIRMED SQUIRM

You may be able to wiggle your
way to good grades.

Lawrence Morehouse. a
University of California physiolo-
gist. says he has spent 40 years
observing students who squirm
dttring exams. and he says they earn
better grades than their more placid
peers."

Morehouse says that toe-tapping.
jiggling. wriggling. and weight-
shifting supply fuel to the brain by
increasing blood circulation. He
suggests that this keeps students
alert during the last lap ofan exam
or in a tedious lecture.

“Students who just sit have a

tendency to do badly. even stupidly.
on the final few exam questions."
says Morehouse.

Morehouse hopes his observa-
tions won‘t incite a rash ofambitious
