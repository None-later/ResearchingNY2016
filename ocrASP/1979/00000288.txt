To the Editor:

The editorial in Friday's April 20 ASP
concerning overkill in the SA Presidential
Campaign is art important comment on the
methods of campaigning for Student
Association office.

It is a valid observation for the ASP to say
that no student group has fair access to the
pillars during election time arid tltus cannot
fully advertise events and group meetings.
Litter is also greater during this time in
obvious conflict with the University‘s anti-
Iitter awareness program. But for the ASP to
go so far as to say that the presidential
candidates don‘t care about these issues is
misleading. . .

Central Council representatives from State
and Alumtti. representing my campaign
committee introduced a resolution to Council
on Wednesday of last week which would
-. encourage presidential candidates to disclose
To "'9 Edna" ' the expenses of their campaigns. This would
result irt voluntary reduction in campaign
spending byca ndidatesand decrease cltitterol'

. By ignoring all of the positive and valid
things that SA has accomplished this
year. one wonders whether “bringing SA

Lenny Harrison

home" is really art attempt to t‘cword
“running away from home“?

He has made many friends on this
campaign. but the potential to makejust
as many enemies is omnipresent.

Lenny Harrison is an outsider of SA
and its workings. and despite his
insistence that this will work to his
advantage. his poor knowledge of the
issues. and a lack of a concrete plan for
the coming year make him a very
unrealistic candidate.

Harrison commented that experience
is not a factor in thejob ol'SA President.
but he gave no concrete advantages for
supporting him. other than that he was a
total outsider with a fresh view. Ifthcre is
anything SA does not need right now. it is
a president who. before beginning to
work on the important issues. must learn
most of them from scratch.

Experience does count. arid wltile
having less than the other candidates may

anymore. According to the Maintainancc
staff I ltavc talked to. it is illegal to post
posters on the pillars on the Podium unless
they are one of the bulletin boards in front of

still up is the fact that there are so many. that
valuable work time would be taken up by tltc
ripping down of posters and as in the words of
one Maintainance worker. he did itot \ 'ant to
