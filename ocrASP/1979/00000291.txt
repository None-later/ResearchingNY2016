SEATTLE (AP) The Battle of the

Supchonics begingdclcnse oi. their
.National Basketball Association
Western Conference title against the
Phoenix Suits in the sold out Seattle
Center ('oliseurn, ‘

The Sonics erttcr the best-ol-sevcn

series victory over tlte Los Angeles
takers, 'I lie Suns reached the
conference championship‘round by
dispatching the Kansas Lily Kings
in their series 4—2, .

Rchouitding is expected to be the
key in the Seattle-Phoenix match tip.

I Scittitle runs when the opportunity
exists. “ltllL' l’Itoeitix prelers to run
all the time. liut. without the
basketball. that‘s impossible.

“I would say we‘re itist as strongas
Kansas City. it itot stronger. on the
boards. and tltat will he a key.“ said

- veteran Sonics forward l’atil Silas.

Seattle guard Fred Brown said.
“Out from line is probably ottr
biggest strengtlt. that and otir
haekcottrl. because it adds so many
things to tire games.

"I would say tlte guards and
rebounding \till he the key. the
Suns have guys “ho cart get otit on

without tlte brill."

“Seattle slows it down.“ lie saidt
“'l’heir game is a slower tcrttpn. If we

able to itirr against Seattle.

" l he eiittenl thing in running the

Graduating?

for the last time?

Seattle beat Phoenix in three of
{our regular season games and in the
process held the Suns to an average
of HM pointstt game,Tarbelowthcir
average of HS. .

"We have as much quickness as
tltcy do. Boardwisc we‘re a little
stronger. They probath shoot a
little better tltan we do. I look for it
dynamite series." said Silas.

Sonics guard (itis Williams ripped

~ .
the L'ikers for an average of 30.8
points a game in that series. and
hopes to continue the price agaanst
Phoenix. He expects the SoniCs-to
run whenever they can.

“It‘s what we do best.“ he said. “I I
don‘t think we should change unless ‘
somebody starts hurling us.

“We play good defense. rebound
well arid run well. If you do those
three things. you hope you can win.“
