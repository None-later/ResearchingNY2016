F eldman, Lerner Only Singles Winners

by David Osborn

One streak was given a continued
lifeline and another came grinding
to art abrupt halt in Hamilton
yesterday when Colgate University
dominated the singles matches and

defeated the Albany State men's p

tennis team 6-3.

'I he Red Raider victory was their
fourilr straight over the Danes: tr
streak Albany coach Bob lcwis had
hoped to break in earnest. He set it
as one of his sqtrttd‘s goals before the
season begati.

Albany's nine ntateli witi streak,
which included fottr triumplts trotti
last fall. was broken by the decision.

At llinghaintori on Saturday
afternoon the Albany State men's
track team was forced to enter no
corripetitors in the disctts and shot
put in a quadrangular riiect. Such a
move is always inviting trouble and

that fact was brought to light
painfully for the Danes when
Cortland totaled enotlglt points

tn those two events to essentially
secure the meet.

"I was generally pleased with the
competition and the tunes and
perforrtratrt'cs were good." said
Albany track coach liob Mtrrisey.

Colgate‘s dominance was evident

that there wouldn't be enough
