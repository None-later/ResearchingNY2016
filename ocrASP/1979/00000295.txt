said the) feel that a state takcmer

between the two systems.

"Very few people l'\c talked to
l'avor a SUNY (‘UNY merger."
said O‘Lcary. "This includes people
at DOB. legislatures. people at

student enrollment.“

In response to SASU's' l'cariol~
ctttbacks in graduate programs
0'l.cary pointed out that SUNYA
obtained $l2 million in research
grants last year.

“i acknowledge that there are
probably some ha rd decisions lacing
higher education in New York
during the next few years. SUNY
has projected that student
enrollment would make a slight rise
then drop in NM. Wc feel on this
campus we can continuc to make
otrr enrollment goals while
continuing to keep the same
proportion ol~ undergraduate and
graduate students."

()‘l.cary‘s vision ol~ this campus
over the next decade is not one of
cutbacks or simply maintaihing the
present educational level. Ilc
predicts “slow hard growth“ in
a variety of areas. especially in
Humanities and Social Sciences.

"Humanities have moved lorward
\cry well in the last few years and
we‘re seeing some unique programs
dcvclop there. A distinctiw part ot
this campus has to he the Social
Sciences and our prolcssional
schools, Basically. otrr \\holc thrust
toward public policy,"

()‘lcary hinted that the campus is
examining possihlc doctorate
programs in psychology and
computer sciences. pointing out that
SllNYA‘s lulore doctoral progimm

would be logical outgrowths of
present graduate studies and not in
a field that would require massiw
rccrtriting of faculty and resources.

Asked if the stigmas of SUNY‘s
retrenchment years has begun to
wear off. O'Lcnry said the campus
has encountered an prohlcms
recruiting top faculty. He added
that in his opinion the faculty
recruited in the last two years are

equal to those recruited before the '

t'clrcncltmcnt period.

"I think the important thing to
keep in mind is that campus has
enjoyed growth in the last two years
and with a little planning it can
continue that growth in the years to
Come.“

When askcd it he was worried
anoul the possibility ol legal action.
l.co said “We wanted an education

value it enhances the whole movie.
liming no prograrrt increases the
risk ol action. htrt students have an
interest in this Home and 'lliC‘s

purpose is to show ﬁlms people i
want to see. We had the option of -
showing any porn ﬁlm not under
litigation. but most of them are pure
trash." he said. “We showed Happy
Days a while ago. and that was a
mistake. Deep Throat is considered
the best porn movie ever made. '
lj “The policy needs to be
reviewed.“ said Nusbaum. "Cer-
tain points need clariﬁcation. A
review was initiated earlier this
year. according to Docllclcld. “We
are waiting for input from
University Legal Services." be said.

“There needs to bc a distinction
between lilm goups and other-
groups." said 'l‘EC Treasurer Debra
Weincr. "Other groups that
normally don't do so. show films as
fundraisers. and X-ratcd movies
nrakc a lot of money. Our purpose is
to show films and let the students
choose what they want to see. not
raise money.“ ‘

“We show one X-rated movie a
year." l.co added. ’l'wo years ago we
showed Dev/r ’lirrour as part oi an
