Dan McCoy. founder oftlie Ugly

Just Shake it
and Let it Fall Into Place.
The Precision Haircut.

Because your head is unique. the way your hair
grows is equally unique. Really qutte different from
every one elsc's.

Precision haircutting is a technique for cutting
the hair in harmony with the way it grows. Your
hair eventually grows out but it doesn't lose Its
shape with a precision haircut. Consequently your
haircut will look as good after five days as it does
after live minutes. And because the hair falls
naturally into place you won't have to keep fusstng
with it. Usually a shake of the head does it.

At Command Performance we shampoo.
precision-cut and blow dry your hair for fourteen
dollars. whether you're a gal or a guy. And no
appointments are over necessary. _

We also offer permanent waves. coloring.
frosting and conditioning. But we really shine Wlih
precision. And so will you.
