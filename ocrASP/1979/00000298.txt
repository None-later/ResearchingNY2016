Choices. Lite is about choices..and in
Woody Allen films. the choice winds up
to a penultimate moment. wherein the
hero takes a metaphysical leap.

In I’lui II Item" .StI/n. the choice is
a moch of the one Humphrey Bogart. had
to make thirty years earlier It) an airport
in Casablanca: grab love for some
personal happiness. or go beyond that.

noble choice. but walk away empty

\' I. MAY 4, 1979

 

 

In tIie far eiid of the ’atroon Room
Lounge. donuts and coffee were being
place on it tftblL'. as is usual for receptions
held there. The honored guest sat on a
couch in the corner of tlie room. talking
with abotit IS students. most of whom
were black. Clad iii suit and tie. the man
could have easily passed as a
representative of a big corporation
talking about career opportunities wiili
the students. Appearances can be
deceiving. however. The man was Black
activist Stokely Carmichael. and he
wasn't talking jobs or starting salaries.
He was talking revolution.

Tom Martello

In the mid attd late sixties. Stoker
Carmichael was one of the most
dominant figures iii the Black activist
movement. Carmichael was born in ly94|
in Trinidad and came to the Unifed
States at [It ‘ age of tcit. He is a graduate
of Howard Uttiversity. where he began
his civil rights work. l-'rom his extensive
work in registering Black voters iii the
South. Carmichael rose to l'ad the
SltltlL‘ltl-Ntttt~\itilctil Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) and its nation-wide
efforts for social change. Using this
power base. Cartiiicliael helped change
the direction of the lilack movement iti
Amcri'a away from Dr. Martin
Luther King's passive resistance policies
antl toward more aggressnc action.
Carmichael populari/cd the phrase
“Black Power" atid later scried as
Honorary Prime Minister oi the Black
Panther Party.

Ten years after leaving the Black
’aiithcrs. Stokely Carmichael 'has not
mellowed. He still fights for change and
does not rttlc ottt violence as a method to

 

 

However. King did teach usa gr-at thing:
he taught tis ho\\‘ to confront the enemy
without fear."

Carmichael considers "the enemy" to
be capitalism. and added that this
includes Black capitalism. His solution to
the problem of combatting capitalism
and racism: “Organimtion. Simple -r
organi/ation. It is absurd to think this is '
an individual struggle.“

Carmichael acknowledged that he has
cotne into contact with 'many Blacks who
disagree with his approach and that the
struggle is not art easy one. l“‘l'he
capitalist system has put obstacle. in Iiiy
way. But I say we must look at the
principles of socialism and start with the
affirmative statement. There is nothing
yott cannot do."

He was quick to label many of the
blacks who disagreed with him as people
“who think they are thinking. but a re not
r'ally thinking - capitalism has
brainwashed them."

As Carmichael spoke at the reception.
his manner was easy: when he talked of
revolution arid violence. it was iii a quiet.
deliberate tone. But. later that evening

 

when he spoke to a crowd at the Campus I

 

Storier Stttr‘f’ﬁttitnghevoluuon

"The “N thing my PWPIC came "1' said. “The thirst of the people is for

contact with the capitalist system was
slavery. It has oppressed us ever since.
My responsibility is to overthrow the
capitalist {system so it doesn‘t oppress
everyone on the face of the earth.“

And: I
I"We are told by capitalism that you get'

rich through individual initiative. The
only reason they‘re rich is because they‘re
theist atid rogues. Those who work do
Iiot enjoy the fruits of their labor. The
system must be overthrown."

Also:

“The capitalist system is a backward
system... America is the most
technologically developed country on the
face of the earth. yet in l9_52 they made
cheaper and better cars than iii [979.
Look at these ‘ttpitttlist pigs -- they have
the technology to build cars atid the
scientific knowledge to make them last
for 20 years. but they don‘t do it. They
bttild thctii so you can buyatiothcr car iti
.1 yea 
Carmichael csplaiticd that his r -asons

 

' for coming here inclttdcd a desire to litid

black students who are conscious ol the
struggle. bttt also to make others more

freedom." He said that throughout
history. foreign powers had robbed
Africa of its land. resources. man-power
and culture.

At this point. Carmichael
demonstrated his charismatic public
speaking qualities. Until then. he had
only raised his,voicc occassionally. His
main speaking device had beena curiousi
one: he would state an opinion contrary
to his which had been given to him. then-
pause and br‘ak into laughter. Many
times his audience la'ughcd with him.
which meant that he didn‘t have to
respond to these opposing views.

littt now. his speech had reached a
fever pitch. After talking about
oppression Africans had bore from
foreign powers. be yelled: “Africa kicked
ottt the eolotiialist powers!“ ‘l'ltcn. he
went down the list one by one:"‘AfI'ica
kicked ottt England! Africa kicked out
I;rattce! Africa kicked out the United
States! Africa kicked ottt Italy! Africa
kicked ottt Portugal! Africa kicked out
lielgitnii!

There was no need fora microphone.

“Africa will be independent itiid
socialist." Iic exclaimed. “No force can
ship it!" lhc audience burst itito

 

applause.

Carmichael said that he believes in the
dialectical process that everything
changes all the time and this will help i
the revolution occur. “Everything affects
everything else. Man is greedy arid
altruistic. But that can change. For
instance. by the time you're 2| iti this
syteni. if You are not competitive. youarc
ntit normal. That can be changed to
‘cotipct‘tttivc‘." '

After his speech. Carmichael fielded
questions front tlic audience. The anti-
