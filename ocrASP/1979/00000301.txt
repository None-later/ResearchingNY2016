Nine Years Ago Today

. it‘s hard to imagine anything different. Life at SUNYA is, reallly a
piece of cake. or anything else good to munch on ona Fridayafternoon
on the podium. after you‘vejust gotten high. And the biggest thing on
campus right now is the SA elections. about as inciteful an event as a
meeting of the chess club.

But it wasn’t always that way. Nine years ago today. things were very
different. While we can sun our secure bodies while lying on the
podium. our brothers and sisters a generation ago were not so lucky.
Nine years ago today. four students were shot and killed at Kent State
University in Ohio. in a tragic event stemming from the protests of
Nixon‘s bombing of Cambodia. and we must never forget that.

’l'oday is HAP day. a day wherein students. faculty and
administrators are supposed to forget any hostilities they may havc.and
concentrate on becoming aware of each other. his a friendly. happy
day.and the fountains will be turned on amidst beer drinking. partying
and fun. ' '

Yet. it would befit usall to pause fora moment in remembrance ofthe
Kent State students who lost their lives. and to reflect anti rcmembcra
time when things were so very different. We must never take anything
for granted. or ignore tragedy simply because it doesn‘t confront us
every day.

it‘s hard to imagin- anything different. but nine years ago today.
things were extremely so. '

Education On A Shoestring

And while times have changed. so has education. Students todayarc
not what they were ten years ago. There is a minimal amount of
motivation in today‘s colleges. Let‘s“ face it: it‘s a game of get the best
grade the 'asiest way possible.

Students. if they may be called that. give schoolwork the lowest
priority in their daily social schedules. The learning they do seems
forced. the courses they take seem forced. and the faculty response
seems forced as well. N H u  ‘ “www.cw ‘

There is" a major flaw in the edit 'ation system. ifit hasdcteriorated’to
such a rut that it cxists‘in today. Administrators and faculty member
realize this, but ignore it as if it wasn't a reality.

When students love this school. what have they really learned? And
of that. how much did they actually desire to l'arn'.’ The education
system prevalent today is like u rushed budget European vacation.
wherein a crowded tour goes rushing by everything too fast and
impersonally to really get anything ortt of it.

Change is needed. and it is needed fast. Education is for the
individual. and let‘s face it. the individual at SUNYA is learning very
little.

 

the Field

 

Justice Arthur (ioldberg disagreed urth the
majority oprrrion in thc Sulliutrr cttsc. llc
anticipated the legal difficulty rtcus
orgtrni/trtiorts now face. (ioltlbcrgtrrgucd that
“ l he rigorous criticism by press and citi/crrs
of thc corrdttct of thc gmernmcut ol the day
will soon yield to silence ifoflicials irrcorrtrol
oi gmcrnrncrrt agencies. instctrd of answering
criticisms. can resort to friendly juries to
forestall criticism of their official conduct."
lle polrrtcd out that public officials htuc ready
access to the Incdia to corrch false
information. He has not strymg that the
Constitution protects dclturrtrtor'y statements
directed against the pr'i\atc coirtlrtct of a
public official or proatc chi/err.

.lusticc llogo lilack rccogrri/cd that the
“active malice" standard rcpicscrttctl it poor
compromise. an elusive concept. He
concluded: "An unconditional right to say
what one pleases about public affairs is \ihtrl I
consider to be the minimum guarantee of the
First Amendment. I regret that the (‘ourr has
slrrppctl short of this holding irrdlspcnsiblc to
ptcscr‘tc otrr lrcc ptcss from destruction."

(‘oloncl llcrbcrt admits to being it ptrhlrc
person. Speech about his public conduct is
under consideration. if the Supreme (‘ourt
had ruled \yiscly. he would rtot be allowed to

bring it libel action.
