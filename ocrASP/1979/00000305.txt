Williams Again Stars As
Danes Beat Two Opponents

by David Osborn .
Tuesday was one of those awful
mid-spring days when the
conditions are more reminiscent of
late autumn than early May. And
the Albany State men‘s track team
must have appeared to be pretty
poor hosts as they greeted Williams
and Union on the University'l‘rack'
with stiff Menus and Cllllllltg‘
temperatures. ‘

The strong winds swirled.
unrnercifully arottrid the green track
and slapped runners particularly
hard on the far side from the gyrri.
l‘hrowing events and jumpers were
hampered when the hr'ec/c would
occasionally slacken and throw their
timing off

By late iii the afternoon. with the
sun setting and temperatugcs
dipping into the upper 40's. runners
in the three mile were very reluctant
to part with their gear and p of off
their warm-up suits.

What was supposed to he a close
tussle between the Danes and Union
itrrned into a windswept romp for
Albany with times and perform-
ances obviously affected by the
\ariables. Winning eight of the lit
events contested. the Danes {valued
in with 9t points to far ouidistance

Union with 5| and Williams with“.

The meet completed Albany‘s
dual meet schedule with a fine 7-2
mark. They now head into the
crucial section ol the season with
conference. regional and national

encounters. The SUNYAC meet.
where the Danes were third last year
and are hoping for the same result
this time around. will begin that
stretch tomorrow.

"ft (the wind) slowed down the
times on the race run around the
oval." said Albany assistant coach
Ron White. “lt may have messed up
the javelin and the discus a bit also.
It also took many of the potential
qrrality times away from the meet
and turned it into essentially a head-
to-liead competition type thing."

In the “)0 yard dash. with the
wind at his brick. Dane standout
lrosh Howie Williams once again
blit/ed the field to take the tape in
9:6. He ran the same school record
time last week against ()swego.
later. he completed his third double
victory of the campaign when he}
took th_c 220 in 22.3 seconds: he
edged mate Jimmy Pollard in built
races.

Official track and field
stipulate that a time can‘t qualify for
a record if the competitor was aided
by a tail wind or a cross wind
exceeding 4.473 nipli.. the
equivalent of mo meters per second.
Williams‘ effort on Tuesday was
certainly aided by such a force
although no official reading was
available but his clocking versus
()s'wego was probably legitimate.

~ “Howie has the potential to
certainly be the finest sprinter we've
ever had at Albany.‘ White said. of

the runner who can range in events
from the 50 indoors to the 440
outdoors. ‘l'd say potentially he‘s a
national finalist and an All—
American. llis attitude is great and
everything is on the plus side."

Just a freshman. he has four years
to improve. and the continued work
of head coach Bob Murisey on
Willianis‘ start .could bring the I00
time down a few' more tenths before
he is (lone. His sniootlt stride is the
remarkable pa rt and a glussol'water'
placed atop his head before a race
riiight not be missing a single drop
when he crosses the finish line.

Al llcnnctt took the pole vault for

 

Albany with a success at til-0. He
said the wind can hurt or help a
vaultcr. “But today ('l'ucsday) I
think it helped me.“ he explained. “lt
gme the added concentration
because 1 was aware of it and it also
helped me with my speed down the
runway. 'l'here‘s the possibility to
tighten up. but I resisted."

outstanding distance runners in the
a tea and the holder of'a 4:06 lifetime

distances. had coping with the wind.
Other Albany winners included
Pollard in the |20 yard high hurdles.
Jim Cunningham iIi the 440 hurdles.
Steve Warshal in the discus and the
Tony Ferretti anchored mile relay
team. The Danes nabbed ten second
places and ten third places in the
competition and had the meet in
hand from the very beginning.

Cunningham. the tall. blonde
hirrdlcr who was second in his
specialty at the SllNYAC's. was a
\ictor over a Williams man by 59.4
to 59,5: lloh l’rouls took third for
the Danes. the wind can be a
psychological factor too. according
to Cunningham. and the \isiting
runners may have been more
affected. (.‘unniugliarii came brick in
the filial 50 yards to claim the race.

“It messes up your steps and the
timing so I was taking many more
steps in between the hurdles."
Cunningham said. “The wind drains
you on the far side bill it also helped
me when 1 passed that giiy in the last
few strides with the wind at my back.
’I he guy I beat has done much faster
than me in personal bests. he was
just psyched out."

A noch success for Albany was
the improvements in the weight
throwing c\erits. an arra that cost
tlicrii dearly in an earlier loss to
('ortland. In addition to Warslial‘s
discus win with a “9'0" heave.
Albany grabbed second iii the

From the very beginning to the
very end. things just did not work
oirt the way Albany State men‘s

tennis coach Bob Lewis thought

they would. His team was already
almost an hour late in leaving fora
match against lltirtwick on
Wednesday. btrt that problem palcd
when compared to what happened
next.

Lewis planned on going to
llartwick without tarry Linett. the
Danes second singles player.
because Linett had a class that he
could not miss. But l5 minutes
before the team bus was about to
leave. Lewis rcc a call that lone

stomach virus. and would not be
able to participate. Without these
two key performers. Albany
revamped their tanks. shuffled their
lineup. and were beaten by an
irtlerior llar'twick team. 5-4.

"ll was a freakish thing." Lewis
said. “I ktrew we could win without
lorry. but wcdori't have that kind of
depth to lose two of our top three
players and still win. liver ybod y had
to nrrnc tip two places. it we were at
ltrll strength. we would have won‘)-

won 7-2, llut not without botli of
them."

Paul l-eldmari stayed put at
number one singles for Alba ny.and
after. a slow start. defeated (iar'y
Squires. 7—5. (i-l. “Paul played
tentatively in the first set." said
Lewis. “and he had trouble breaking
the other guy‘s serve. But we got to
Hartwick late.and Paul only had l5
minutes to warm irp. so he might not
lirive been really ready.“

After l‘eldniari. though. the
troriblc started. The vacated two and
three singles slots had to be filled.
and the d rnpoff in talent was quickly
evident. llartwickhasa4-2ma "for
