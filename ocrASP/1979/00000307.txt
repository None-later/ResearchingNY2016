Bookstore Losses Total I ‘

. More Than Last Year

by-Christopher Koch

Losses totaling more than 565.000
in merchandise from SUNYA‘s
bookstore last year will be exceeded
by the losses from tltis fiscal year
ending in Junc.according to Follctt-
SUNY bookstore manager Gary
Dean. ‘

“Right now. we can see no way to
stop the thefts.“ said Dean. “We‘re
looking into an electronic marking
system such as the library uses. but it
will probably not come into 

The store has lost more than
textbooks. according to Dean.
"Candy and other small items used
to be so cheap that no one needed to
steal them. 'l‘oday.a candy bar costs

“hirtyccnts. and a pen costs fifty. As
prices go up. tlte motive for stealing
goes up also." he said.

The bookstore employs a security
guard at tile door at all times. but
tltis has not rcdttccd tltcfl.according
to Dean. “'l he guard is there
primarily to see that books don't get
into the store." he explained. "We
don‘t want any confusion lictuccn
tltc books you are buying and the
ones you already own."

from theft. UAS general manager
Norb Zahm said. "We lost over
350.000 a year. and that was a few
years ago. But there is not much we
can do about it. No one has found a
way to stop shoplifting.“

“It would be impossible."he said.
“to institute an electronic code
system such as the library has. It
would cost more than the thefts do."

The bookstore has received
criticism from students due to its
failure to discount the prices -of
textbooks. According to Zahm.
"there is a \cry stttall markup itt
books. We couldn‘t afford to
discoqu tltcm. A fcu years ago. “C
tricd selling large tttcrchandisc iii the
store. such as stereos. cameras. and
gifts. liut students did not buy them.
It these items had sold. he could be
discounting books right non."

Another recent complaint about
the bookstore concerns tltc return
policy. According to Dean. "liy lL't‘
