.‘E“’ YORK (AP) It was early in
’rturday night's game against the
New York Islanders. New York
Rangers" right wing Don Murdoch
killed over to the bench to ask
Coach Fred Shcro a question.

“Do you want me to come off if
islanders left wing Clark Gillis
comes on‘.’" Murdoch asked.

“What for. you can check that big
guy." said the coach.

“It turned out.“ Murdoch said
later. “he was right.“

In fact. almost every idea Shero
has had during this National
Hockey League semifinal series has
been right. As a result. the Rangers
are a victory away from their first
Stanley Cup playofl'finalsince I972.

"We're in the driver‘s seat now.“_

said the Rangers'l’hil Esposito."but
you can get shoved over to the
passenger seat pretty quick.“

(ilenn Reseh. “Ito M" guard the
Islanders‘goal r and their hopes 7
tonight in (lame Six. took that a step
further.

“The nest stop is the back seat. if
things don't change." he said.

Strange. but true tltc calcit-
phrase at this \\ild and \\oon series.
The Islanders. the NHI.‘s regular-
season champions. the team that
linished 25 points ahead of the
Rangers in the Patrick l)i\ision
standings. are one loss anay' from
elimination.

"'l'hcy‘ finished first. he finished
third. 'I he pressure's got to be on

them." said Rangers defenscman
Carol Vadnais. '

’Ihc pressure has been on them
\irtually since this series started.
And though the Islanders ha\c non
too of the games. both in overtime.
they don‘t seem to haye handled that
pressure \cry' well.

It‘s old nens by non. httt it bears
retelling: the higher-scoring fornard
line of Bryan ’l‘rottier. the o-l'oot-fl
(iillics and right \\ing Mike Bossy
has not prod uccd up to
expectations. 'lhc Islatttlct's‘ poncr
play. \\hich produced a goal at one
out ol mery' three I‘egtllat'~scason
chances. is 0-for-2tl against the
Rangers.

Defenseman Denis l’ot\in. the
ignition key ot the lslandcrs‘attack.
has been pressuch continually and

harnessed effectively by Rangers
checkers A forcing the responsibili-
ties of offense and defense on players
less well-prepared to accept them.

Beyond that. every time the
Islanders have scored and they've
had to battle for each of their |2
goals. the Rangers have replied with
1! goal of the-ii own.
