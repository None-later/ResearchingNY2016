I UAS Buys Elsewhere 1 __

by Robert Blasenstein

University Auxiliary Services
(UAS) does not deal with the
nationally boycotted company J. P.
Stevens. or its eighteen affiliates.
according to the UAS manager
Norbert Zahm. This is also true of
the other two pilrchasing outlets
which buy for llIL‘ university
.according to Purchasing Depart-
ment Director John Haggerty and
Research Foundations Tom
McLaughlin.

Zahm said that “UAS does not
even btly linens.“ bill they do rent
from outside vendors. The

University Linen Service buys from
a distributor. Bell Linen‘ of
Bennington. Vermont. According to
Bell Linen o ner Harold Solomon.
"we deal olgty with‘ Paramount.
Baltic. Baltex. and American
lnstituted Textiles.“ none of which
are associated with J. P. Stevens.

Haggcrty said that the purchasing
department buys carpets from
Hague Carpets of Utica. N.Y.. and
Custom Floors located in Albany.
neither of which deals with J. l’.
Stevens.

Albany Student Union (ASU)
member Bruce Cronin has been

' asking for an investigation to make

sure that the universitydoes not deal
with-J. P. Stevens in any way. J. P.
Stevens. the second largest textile
maaulaeturer in the country. is on
the boycott list of many national
unions and'orgttnilations because
they have been accused of tax
evasion. violation of health attd
safety standards. and paying
substantially lower wage payer than
other major corporations.

Cronin said of ‘SUNYA's
apparent non-involvement with J.
l’. Stevens. "Fantastic. But we‘re

SUNYA Check Cashing May End

 

‘ New Machine Takes Over "

by Wendy Greenﬁeld

A proposal has been made to

According III Zahm. the machine
ltus nine ltutctiolls including \artety
deposits. Isithdranals. and balance

‘We owe over 520.000 III hanks
throughout the state because ol'bad

reason. the new check ting policy
will be adopted. said luhm.

"It is impossible III gel . lltisl

Ihcre are many advantages III the
