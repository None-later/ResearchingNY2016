' ‘O’Le'ary Rents

by Lisa Dwyer

SUNYA‘s Real Property Division
has contracted a five year lease that
will allow SUNYA President
Vincent O'bcary and his family to
rent a two story 13 room. 13 acre
estate in the Slingerlands at an
annual expense to the state of
$15,000.

The lease on the New Scotland
Avenue home took effect as of
December 1, 1978. President
O'Leary and his tamin officially
moved into the home on April 17.
1979. The periods during which the
house ' ' ,' ‘ was
necessary in order to do “painting
and refinishing of floors and to
move furniture into the home wltich
had been purchased with state
funds."ttccording to Vice President
for Business and Finance lioh
Stierer.

President O'leary will only be
obligated to pay the cost of the
rooms which have been designated
as “private”. This wottld include the
famin living quarters such as
bedrooms. bathrooms. and a Iainin
room. The remaining areas of the
home which are paid for by the state
will be designated as "public" and
will he used as reception rooms in
connection with rccei\ing visiting
officials. loreign students. lacully.
and pttlL‘lIls.

lratlitionally, most institutionsof
higher learning tiller provisioned
housing on campus for the president
of a college or university.

President O'Leary's home located
on 1751 New Scotland Avenue
provides a temporary solution for
locating an oll'icial residence for

“'

Dietary. The state of i  York is,

responsible for funding the $1250
monthly cost of the home whichwili
.be an annual e‘chnsc of 515.000.
During the construction of the
Uptown Campus. the then SUNYA
President C91 ins. did not’ request
that a home be provided for him. He
preferred instead to live in his family

residenCe in Loudonville. According.

to Bob Stierer "there wasa proposal

at that time which he turned down.“ "

Subsequent SUNYA presidents
such as Benczetand Ficldswerealso
without University-owned

'J Benzett resided in his
own home. also located in
Loudonville. while Fields was
provided housing by Union College
in Schenectady. “Since Union
College officials ’did not have a
specific use for the home. they felt it
would be in their best interests to
lease the home and have it properly
maintained." Stierer saad. This
home was rejected for President
()‘l.eary's use primarily because of
its distance from campus. according
to Stierer.

considered by the Real Property
Division and “as deemed timsl

and its proximity to lhc Albany
State Campus.

"The State of New York has not
pttreltased any homes lot chief
SUNYadministrators.“$tiercrsai-
He added that this decision tied in
with the cutback in construction
programs at that timne by the state.

According to a Times Union
article of last March. SUNYA Vice

tat‘e. With Expense To State

Chancellor for Capital Facilities
Oscar Landsford said "the president
has responsibilitiesthat can only be
discharged in 'his home.“ Such

responsibilities include O‘Leary‘s .
plans this summer during which he
hopes to invite “100 or 50— Resident
Assistants to come to his home as
various times during the summer

 

 

 

 

vacation. “He plans to give dinners
and discuss the roles and functions
of Resident Assistants on campus,"
said Stierer.

The state will also provide for
a housekeeperand a grounds-keeper
which will be supplemented as
necessary. .

Mrs. O'Lcary said that she was

very pleased with the home but
added that the family was still in the
:moving phase and needed‘time to
settle down. ‘fThe first floor of the
home will be used almost exclusively
as a reception area for guests and is
considered the main public area of
the home.” Mrs. O'beary said. “The
house has a game room downstairs
that we'll use use family room.“she
explained. “The second floor will be
used as the family‘s private living
quarters. -1t‘s a rnice house." Mrs.
O‘Leary commented. "lt‘s going to
be a delightful place. I‘m sure that it
will meet all of its requirements."
