An expanded second edition of
ACT (Assessment of Courses and
Teachers) will be published in the
beginning of the fall semester. said
Academic Affairs Committee Chair
Mike bevy.

“The first ACT was small because
we wercjust trying to get our foot in
the door." said levy. The second
ACT will include twenty academic
departments rathc than the original
ten.

Levy said he is “now aiming for
university-wide stipport“lo improve
ACT for the upcoming year. ACT.
an evaluation ofcourscs. is not fully

accepted in academic departments. .

According to [.ety. ACT is tised
by students as a guide for selecting
courses and instructors. Some
professors might obiect. however. to
students putting too rntteh faith iii
the evaluation. '

English professor Harry Sraley

feels that the numerical rating
system is inadequate. “An
evaluation such as this tries to place
a quantitative rating on something
qualitative," said Staley. “There
seems to be no correlation between
numerical grades and teaching
effectiveness.“

Staley, in an effort to eliminate
numerical evaluations. has issued a
petition which many faculty
members have signed. He added that
those suffering most froin the
evaluations are students.

“We can‘t solve one problem by
using a system that lacks integrity.
These evaluations will perpetuate
misconceptions and they will
perpetuate errors. Profound
decisions will be made by students
on the basis of faculty information."
said Staley.

Stalcy believes that brief written
evaluations on courses and teachers
would he more useful and beneficial

Levy. however. said the university
is too large to use such evaluations;
“The problems of correlation and

This view was shared by the

faculty members who helped create
the ACT questions.

is evident by the increase in v
departments now represented on the
program.

“We are all in“ favor of the
program. The evaluations give the
students a certain kind of indication
of courses but they should recognize
that it does not tell them
everything," said Biology Cltair
Leonard Lerman.

CUE Director Stanley Schwartz
