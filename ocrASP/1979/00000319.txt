Plan On Rationing

WASINGTON (Al’f'l he House on
Thursday rejected President
Carter‘s request for standby gasoline
rationing authority despite an
impassioned appeal from speaker
Thomas P. O'Neill that “this is the
only plan you have.“

The 246-150 vote killed the twice-
modified plan. which would have
given the president authority to
order gasoline rationing in times of
severe energy shortages.

O‘Neill blamed parochial interests
for torpedoing the the proposal.
saying legislaaors looked only at
how the plan would affect their own
areas”.

“Today l‘m shedding a tear for

America. This is the only plan you
have.“ O'Neill said in an emotional
speech from the floor.

He said failure of Congress to
approve the standby plan would
leave the nation unable to cope with
another major disruption in energy
supplies like the 1973-74 Arab oil

' embargo.

White House analysts had feared
from the beginning that
modiﬁcations made to pick up
needed votes from senators from
large rural states would cost the plan
support among urban legislators in
the House.

A Carter spokeswoman said e
president would not comment ont e

After Senate passage Wednesday,
the president said “defeat of this
plan would leave the country
vulnerable and defenseless against a
supply interruption. The

government would require six to-

eight months to develop. pass and
implement a new plan — time we
could ill afford during an energy
crisis.

A I975 law requires the president
to submit proposed gasoline
maioning plans to Congress and
gives lawmakers 60 days in which to
act. The time on the plan killed
Thursday would have run out
Friday. ’

The House recessed until Monday
after the rationing vote. meaning
there is no possibility the plan could
be revived.

However. the House did approve
— by a 'unanimous voice vote 
Carter's plan to require that
thermostats in public buildings be
set at no less than 80 degrees in the
summer and no more than 65 in the
winter.

Rep. John Dingcli. l)-Mich..

‘Dratt Renewal
Approved By
House Committee

WASHINGTON (AP) Renewal of
draft registration for all [0-year-old
men wa‘s overwhelmingly approved
Thursday by the House Armed
Services Committee.

The committee rejected 30-4 an
effort to take the renewed
registration out of a $42 billion
weapon authoriiation bill. The bill
was cleared for House action by a
35-2 vote.

The provision would require an]
young men who turn l8 after Dec.
3]. I930. to register in case the draft
itself is ever reinstated in a war or
emergency.

The provision specifies men. but it
requires the president to recommend
back to Congress details on how he
wants to carry out registration and
whether women should be included.

President Carter has taken no
position oti whether draft
registration should be renewed.

Secretary of Defense liiiaold
Brown has said he still hopes the
present Selective Service System cart
he beefed up to meet war
mobilization requirements without
Icncwing registration.
