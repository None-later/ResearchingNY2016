Precision haircutting is a technique for cutting
the hair in harmony with the way it grows. Your
hair eventually grows out but it doesnt lose its
shape with a precision haircut. Consequently your
haircut will look as good after live days as it does
after live minutes. And because the hair falls
naturally into place you won't have to keep fusstng
