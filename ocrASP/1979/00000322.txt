Times change. The pressing issues of one
lecade are often nothing more than yellowipg
1ewspaper clippings 10 years later. The
tatural process of renewal is healthy; ‘it
nvigorates its. allowing for new ideas. new
lircctions. and new feelings to surface.

What is unhealthy is when an idea or a
aroposal is declared “old” simply because
:hosc with the authority to implement it were
tfraid to allow it to icach its potential.

For example. Lyndon Johnson's Great
Society programs were declared
"unuorkable" by a Nixon/ Agnew clique that
Jidn‘t \tant to see tltem work. The Volunteer
Army is being tagged as "inefficient" in a
:arefully‘ orchestraTEd effort by Arnericart
uilitari.‘ 'tlivating at the chance to reinstate
lte peacetime draft.

And. although the consequences are far
murder. the present system of undergraduate
legree requirements is being suffocated in its
:rib by a University hierarchy whielt never
.santed it to breathe irt the first place.

Art article which appeared last month to the
sllNYA Alumni publication 77w ('ori/Irrn has
:ompelled me to speak out on the issue ol
tndergraduate degree requirements. As the
rtrtltor of the CURE proposal which

which disparaged the (‘URF proposal and

'lhe issue of undergraduate requirement

‘student activis. of the late ‘60‘s brottght

I969. We began ottr efforts witltottt the prior
tpprnval of tlte University administration; ll ,

Yet. while 94% ol the stttdertts voting in a

University embarked upon a systematic
program of faculty retrenchments;

Undet'g ttate students were lelt to lend

So wha_t does the University do‘.’ After
allowing the present system of degree
requirements to flottnder for nine years. the
University announces that the program
doesn‘t work. The tragedy is that this “new
pattern“ of education which called for the
exercising of mutual responsibility by .
students. faculty ttndutdministration. never
given an hottest chance.

To the Editorr" ' " _

Since the"beg’inning of the year. we have
,wondered about the- purpose of the so-ealled
artwork strewn about on campus. We
consider ourselves fairly well-educated yet
cannot understand the signiﬁcance ofa group
of odd-shaped rusted hunks of scrap iron that
was arranged at the front of the podium in the

had to look at them. but it absolutely kills as
knowing that We paid a so-called artist to
solder pieces of metal together and dump
them on campus. ‘

Miss Robins is shocked and surprised that
the "sculpture" behind the PAC has been
defaced. This comes as no surprise to us as the
sculpture itself dcfaccs the garden. The
sculpture looks like some sort of bomb that
didn't explode. The only location 'that that
"sculpture" would enhance and heautifyis the
city dutnp.

The reason that we are writing this letter. is
because we sha re Miss Robins‘concern forthc
campus cnvirontncnt. yet feel that the
environment would be greatly improved if
these structures were removed. and tlte

 

discredited by willful neglect.

l \sould gladly offer the (iarber Committee
the IS-page ('URl’ rational- as it considers
recotnmending “as many models of
undergraduate education as possible.“ I do
this not only because I beliete strongly in
educational pluralism. httt because my own
educational SUNYA was greatly benel'ittcd
by the elimination ol undergraduate degree
requirements: Contrary to the rnytlt tltatall of
us who graduated from Albany from I970-
l‘)78 itth narrowly on ottr majors. I was
able toenjoya broad. liberal education thanks
iii no small part to the CURE proposal.

I believe it is appropriate to conclude with
an excerpt from the lt’e/mr/ on Mar I’tllll‘l‘IH'

by the late Dean ofthe College of Arts and

V To the Edltor:

Most undergradumcs pay little attention to
the tenure, process. I know I did until this
semester when I found out that Dr. Robert
.laeger of the Department of Biology had been
denied tenure. This means that. within a year
- Dr. Jacger will leave this uniVersity to teach
elsewhere. I am sure that Dr. Jaeger “its
denied tenure for what are considered
“legitimate‘-‘ reasons in university systems. In
this'case. I believe two of the reasons were
personality conﬂicts and the lack ol graduate
students completing their programs. Yet.
what I think of is the loss that future htoloyn
students will inevitably suffer tillL‘ ltr hrs
absence. Beyond being a fine lecturer to tile
classroom. Dr. .Iaeger is one or the mmr
student oriented professors l have etct out
