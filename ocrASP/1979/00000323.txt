“Because of the 360percent increase in
the cost of producing nuclear power. a
rate which is 6 times faster than the
inllation rate. nuclear power now costs
five times more than oil.“ said Charles
Komanoff. who works at the General
Accounting Office of the NY. Consumer

studies comparing coal- arid nuke
economics. .
“Fossil fuels can be entirely phased otit

In this interim. we could be using one-

today." Komanofl' also said that Detroit
claims they could triple the gas efficiency
of the atttorttobilc by the year 2000. the
latest. As an economist. he warns.

“Nuclear power ltas become so cxpcnsiw
that it can't compete with the others." He
suggests iinproting efﬁciency and
productivity of the other resources we
consume arid making the transition to
solar energy.
