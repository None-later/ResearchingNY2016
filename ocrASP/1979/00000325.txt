l’at Metltcny is one of the most
taletttcd guitarists to arriye on the scene
in recent years. On Saturday night at the
llullahriloo. he and his four piece
ensemble didcyerything they corild to
prime that fact. From the opener. "l’luise
Dance": to the rock ‘n' roll encore. the
quartet exhibited as professional art act
as one could expect.

Mctltcny‘s playing has intpi'mctl \astly
since his days with the (iary Iiirrton

on the guitar ba\c progressed greatly. It
sets him apart frorn most other
contemporary players. llis soloing titres
ot consist simply of played-out ('hic
'orca lick’s or .lohu Mclaughlin riffs. llis
iiitgcrs run tip and dowrt the fingerboard

there was total trnity between its ideas
