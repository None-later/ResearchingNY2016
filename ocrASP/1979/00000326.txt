l have nsbcstos on my mind. it may he a

importantly. in my lungs. This mnycvokc pity

thc rrcudcmit‘ buildings. use the bathroom
facilities on the podium. live on alumni quad.
orarc in any of the offices on tltc third floor of
the campus ccntcr.chanccs arc. you are in the
same boat as I. The problem is that thc ceiling
tiles that are used in these areas are rnndc from
asbestos fibres. They'arc white with small
perforations and art: cusin broken. as is the
case with many of them.

A5 you may or may not know. asbestos is a
mineral fibrc that has good insulating and
fircpruofing qualities. unfortunately. it also
has tr superb carcinogenic potcntittl.
Thcorctically. one fibre could indtrcc lung
cancer. There was extensive use of asbestos

alarming studies puhlishcd showing a

the two qualities mentioned above. and llrc
fact that it is quite catsin incorporated irtto
plastics and fabrics. divcrsc uses for asbestos
have emerged.

Returning to the problem at hand. the
asbestos ceiling tiles pose a serious health
threat to tire students and faculty of this
school ttlikc. Thc fibres. as contained in the
Complete. unbroken tilc. are less of a threat
than the "punched out" ttlcs. However. these
