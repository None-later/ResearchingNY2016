Guidry and extend his contracmhus
mlifying one of the most flagrant
salary imbalances in baseball.

' |n effect. Guidry. whose current
paycheck looks like coohe wage.
when measuer by contemporaries
of lesser stature. will have his pity
structure brought into line with
other top-salaried players on the
dub - Reggie Jackson $2.9 million.
ﬁve years. Catfish Hunter $3.5
million. five years and Rick Gossage
$2.7 million. five years.

Technically. last year. when the
28-year-old left-hander from
Lafayette. La., carved the best
(

 

record in baseball and won the Cy
Young Award with a 25-3 maak.
he was working on an old contract
calling for 338.000 a year.

This contract. a two—year pact
signed in December oi I977. was
given a three-yearestension through

underpaid. drawing perhaps
$l45.000 for the year after dipping
into the $000,000.

This is ludicrous in today's
spiralling salary structure. which has
big Dave Parker of the Pittsburgh
Pirates making 5900.000 a year. Pete
Rose of the Philadelphia Phillies
3825.000 and Jim Rice oftlrc lloston
Red Sox 5770.000.

(iuidry. because of his age and
potential. is believed in most
baseball circles to be the most
valuable commodity in the game -
Parker. Rose and Rice notwith-
standing.

l‘his value was increased
markedly - and intanginy - last
Saturday when he agreed to
abandon his starting, role on the
Yankee stall and take up bullpen
duties in the absence of relief ace

injury. He already has a win and two

acknowledged that the club was in

the process of new contract tasks:

with their tnottnd marvel.

"This husbccn going on for some
time." Roan said.“Weare delighted
to see a yotrng tnan of his calibre put

' the interest of the club ahead of his
own personal interests, He will
always be a Yankee. We will never
let him get away."

Ros‘eu indicated that there would

be no immediate announcement of

the new contract lest it be construed
as a grandstand ploy to trike
advantage of the overall excitement
generated by (iuidry‘s unselfish
gesture

()wner George Steinbrenner. the
shipbuilding tycoon. has been tied

 

up with strikes in the industry and

has not been as visible as usual

around the Yankee ofﬁce.
However. those who know him.
are convinced that he will not permit
the current imbalance in Guidry‘s
paycheck to linger for long. George
is a proud man. proud of the
Yankee tradition and one who
appreciates loyalty. I _ -'
J-le'd be the last toallow himselro
be called a “eheapskate.”
