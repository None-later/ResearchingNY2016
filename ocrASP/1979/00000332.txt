With theentire ripper right Side or
is body encased in blue and white
pg. Paul Feldman was talking
bout his four years on the Albany
talc men‘s tennis team yesterday.
9 also sprikoia‘bopt 'the accident
hich had dislocated his right
houlder and forced him into an
[most mummy-like state.

,“This is the most upsetting thing

hat has ever happened to me."

Feldman said. referring to the injury
intramural
oftball game last weekend. “And
the extent of it may be more serious
than I first thougiil. At times there’s

a . lot of pain and last night lonly got

two hours of sleep.“
The mishap will force Feldman to
miss the NCAA Division III tennis

' championships next week. He had

to skip the event the past three years
since it crinliictcd~with finals. But
ntiw.rifter piling up numerous fears
in his sport at the conference and
regional level. he will be denied
national prominence
completely.

“I like other sports too nirich to
give up irrtramurals." l‘eldman
explained. "The stupid thing was to
risk sliding which was how lgot the
injury. Geirerally...§oftball isa pretty
safe Sport. So ldon‘t regret playing
but ldo regret sliding a little."

Feldiirarr‘s lriurcls speak for
themselves even though both he and
Coach llob Lewis agree they could
have swelled if Feldman was more
intense iii ltis dedication to tennis.
He won an unprecendentcd four
straight SUNYAC crowns: reached
the ISCAC - a tourney combining
Div. iI-lll schools - semis twice and
the ﬁnals once: compiled an til-l2
collegiate slate and only lost three
dual ritatelrcs in four years.

“I would say that over the nine
years I've been here. and this is
a hard statement. he has probably
dominated his sport rirore than any
other athlete in the school." said
Albiiny Athletic Director llob liord.
“I know I'm gonna be stepping on
some other people when I say that
but he's had a great career. been a
great competitor atid a great
athlete.“

Willi the word great abounding
when people speak of the slim. curly
light-brown haired irativc ol
' sdiile an irrterestin itestion

should be how great. and cvén. why
not greater. A fellow who Feldman
beat 6-3. 6-0 in high school is the-
favorite to win the NCAA Div. I
singles title. so it seems Feldman had
the potential to maybe go further.

Feldman started playing tennis at
the ripe age of twelve. For a couple
if years it was jirst a nice way to
ipend little with his father and it
wasn‘t until he took a series ol
lessons at l4 and the pro suggested
he enter sonre tournaments that lie
began to take the sport somewhat
seriously.

"A lot of people I talked to and I

played with suggested that lgive it a
serious shot." Feldman renrcnr~
bered. “But the summer
tournaments were always such a
chore. If you didn‘t have a car you

had to get a ride. Arid fora tourney '

in New Jersey or something. you‘d
get a ride with your friend at nine.
not play till one or something and
their wait till six usually to get a ride
back."

So the hassle ol'arrangementsand
transportation kept Feldman from
playing a full summer til
torrrnaments. lie played a fen at the
|4-and—under level. was rairkcd in
the 16‘s aird their ranked for two

years in the lti's. The main lactor ,

limiting his develriprrrerrt to a higher
plateau was his litck ol eonrt time iir

 

 

 

the winter.

During the winters from ages I3-
|8 he only played about once-a-
week. "A lot of kids get a big push
from theirkparents when they first
start." Feldman related. “My
parents only encouraged it for.pr'ire
enjoyment. They irever envisioned
the turning pro. Sometimes they got
upset when I'd corrrc late before a big
match 'or didn't take the
tournaments too seriously. But they
\werc basically relaxed ahorrt it.“

At New Rochelle High School.
I‘eldriirrir played on the varsity terrrn
for four years. As a frosh. he played
at number three as his squad took
the county title. Many schools
fielded less than mediocre teams in
Westchester and Feldman said he
remembe feeling odd but not

 . . ,
eiirbarrasscd when ire lound iirrt
Moirrrt Vernon‘s niirrrbertlrree wasa
female.

“'llrc I"l.lA tonrriairrents were
always more exciting. you had to
brittle through a draw and the
competition was always much
tougher than iir high school
irrntclics." Feldman siiirl.cxpressing
his preference itirtournaments. “My
coach the first three year‘s in high
school. Lew Amadson. was about
80. senile. didn ‘t know my nitrite and
called me Lob because I lobbed a
lot."

As ii senior Feldman made it to
the quarters in the New York high
school championships. In the
previous round he had defeated
future Dane teamate Iarry Linnett.

 

Ills father's switching of jobs

 

triicstalled any chance ol attending
a prr\ate school and the choice canti-
“mm to Albany and llrngharnton.

"I hitt'“ Paul was \eiy goiiil III
high school and had done \tell in the
State‘s hril | ieaII/crl that academics
“its important to both him aird his
parents." Iciiis said. recalling his
choice \Hillls. "So I talked to tlieiti
mostly ahoiit academics. l was a
little surprised when l’attl did come
here but I was delighted.“

and his parents were guiekly sold on
Albany. lewis was on sabatical I'rir

and Coach llatlrawrry led the squad.
('ollcgialc tennis must have seemed
like a brec/c for Feldman when he
captured his first SUNYAC title
right away as a frosh.

"I liked Hathaway at first and he
was nrticlr less serious about tennis
than coach Lewis later on."
Feldman said. “Lewis always
wanted me todo the hard workouts.
