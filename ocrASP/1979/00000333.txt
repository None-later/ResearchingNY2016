Perhaps the closest Albany State
has come to the ultimate goal of a
national title was this year‘s
basketball team. It was a special
season for ma ny reasons: The team
won 20 games for only the second
time in the school's history. took
first in two tournaments. tied for the
SUNAC title. and competed in the
NCAA Southern Regional Division
in Danville. Kentucky. The season
was not‘unique for one reason: the
Danes were eliminated in the closing
seconds.

seasons basketball squad had the
proper blend llarry (‘avanaugh
