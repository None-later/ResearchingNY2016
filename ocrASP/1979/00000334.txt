: "SUNYA To limit Party  "

’ Students ‘On The Wagon’

by,Charlie Bell

new policy limiting the use of
alcohol in public areas of university
residence halls takes affect this
semester. according to Director of
Residence John Welty. The goal of
this policy said Welty. is control of
the “inordinate amount of
consumption" which appears to be
“directly related to the increases of
vandalism on campus.”

“We want to prevent people from
getting pie-eyed and breaking out a
few windows." Welty said.

The guidelines. developed la5t
summer by residence personnel

specify maximum liquor quantities
to be determined by projected
attendance figures.

Speciﬁcally. the guidelines set
limits of40 ounces ofbeer.-l0‘ounccs '
of wine or three ounces of‘liquor per
person for group parties held in
dorm lounges.

Welly said that these "per person"
limits are meant solely asa guideline
for determining overall amounts of
alcohol to be available at parties.

“We don‘t want to govern how
much beer a person drinks.“ Welty
said. but added that in scheduling
party arrangments with residence

staff. groups wishing to use public
dorm areas must consider these
limits. , , .

Welty admitted that actually
enforcing the experimental
consumption limits "may not be an
easy thing to do". and added that it
will be the responsibility of the
sponsoring group to keep
consumption in accordance with the
guidelines.

Welty said that the consumption
guidelines are tentative. and may be
subject to review or amendment by
the University Senate's Committee
on Residences

Puts Pressure On Housing f

 

Two Hundred Students In Limbo ,

Hrs/ in a two part series.

With- every available space on
SUNYA's five resitlcncequads filled
and waiting lists for rooms at the
Wellington Hotel and Pittman Hall

members oftbe SUNYAeommunity
rcmaiu without a permanent place
to stay. Forty-eight ofthesc students
are tentporarily housed in the first
and second floor lounges of
Brubachcr Hall on Alumni Quad.

Students housed in lounges. RA
suite rooms and triples galore were
the order of the day whctt 7 percent
of incoming freshmen and new
transfer students arrived on campus
this week to contend with an already
fttll house. In addition to those
camped in makeshift ttccomoda—
lions, SUNYA Residence Director
John Welty reported 77 students
staying in RA suites, and 75 housed
in triples. "

Welty attrributed the lack of
housing space to an increse in tltc
ntttnbcr of continuing students
electing to remain on campus. Ilc
pointctl ottt that 80 percent of this

year‘s sophomore class resides on
campus. up as much as It) percent
from expected levels. “Our
sophomore class is very large this
year. larger than other comparable
classes." suid‘ Welty. “Next year.
when that class moves from
sophomores to juniors. many of
those students willmovc off campus.
'l’hcrclorc.thcnumbcrofcontinuing
students remaining on campus will
go down." But for now. Welly has
bcgttn de-tripling students residing
in increased occupancy and hopes to
complete the operation by mid-
()ctober. “We‘re now identifying no-
shows and some oftbc 200 are being
reassigned," he said. "We anticipate
we'll be able to re; sign (it) to 70
students or so this week." Welty
also cited SUNYA's asmission
process as pttrtially responsible for
the overcrowding experienced in the
dormitories each fall. “Admissions
admits X number of people.“ said
Welty. “When all of these students.

The University Alcohol
Policies. most rccentty rcvrewed in
1974. state that “regulation of
individual use ofalcohnlic beverages
within the rcsidencc‘ halls...is a
mttttcr for the appropriate
quadrangel board. residence hall
committee and residence staff.“

In accordance with the univcristy
policy. the residence staff. places no
specific limits on alcohol
consumption in' students' private
rooms.

“It is only when a party ﬂows out
into the living area that the limits
become applicable." Welty said.

Ile added that the University
could officially adopt a policy that
would enable enforcement tocxtend
to students' rooms.

The new policy effects all live
quads as well as Pittman Hall in
,Loudonville. Student residents of

,the Wellington Hotel. however.

having contracted directly with the
City of Albany as landlord and not
the University itself. are not subject
to the university alcohol regulations.

This year's attempt at controlling
consumption marks the first time
specific limits have been established
at SUNYA's residence halls.

“the residence staff has always
discussed the amount of alcohol
consumed at parties.“ Welty said.
and added that although no direct
evidence exists. tltcrc “appears to
have been an increase in alcohol
consumption in recent years."

Since 1976. the president of

sessions and committee meetings.
"Until the bill‘s passage the rioti—

Ward . “ 'I'herc were only
