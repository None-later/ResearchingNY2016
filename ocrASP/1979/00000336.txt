system was ordered Thursday by
Governor Hugh L. Carey.

Carey also announced that he was

Before making the announcement.
Carey said he conferred with Gov.
Ella Grasso of Connecticut and
Gov. Brendan Byrne of New Jersey
and was assured“ that both states
intended to revoke their odd-even

gas distribution systems.

have quoted gas station operators as
saying they were no longer enforcing
the orders because they had

said. '

 

f‘Short range, the gasoline supply
situation appears satisfactory," he
added in a statement released late
Thursday afternoon.
