Hurricane David O
16 Dead In 

(AP) Tropical Storm David churned
through the urban Northeast on
Thursday, knocking out power to
hundreds of thousands of homes,
sending hundreds fleeing and '
forcing many schools to close.

At least six more deaths have been
attributed to the one-time hurricane
that killed more than 900 people in
the Carribéan, then left at least l6
dead along the Atlantic coast of the
United States. D

David was centered Thursday

afternoon near Glens Falls, N.Y.
and was moving northeast at 30 to
35 mph with sustained winds pf 45
mph along the coast.

Gale warnings were up from Cape

. Henlopen. Dcl., io Eastport, Maine.

And hurricane watchers had their
eyes on two other storms brewing in
the Atlantic. including the newly
christened Tropical Storm Gloria.

Tropical Storm Frederic dumped
more torrential rains on the already
saturated Dominican‘ Republic.

while Gloria whipped into a full-

of Africa. '

David's tree-felling winds, flood-

were cut off in southeastern New
York and southwestern Connect—
icut.

smashed a window and. the falling
glass severed arteries in his legs.
The body of a girl who appeared
to be ll or l2 years old was pulled
from the water of the Rahway River
near woodbridge, NJ. Still missing
in the ﬂood-swollen stream were a

boy about the same age and a ,

policeman who had tried to save
them.

Authorities said‘ four children
