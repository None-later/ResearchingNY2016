Spreads

(AP) Sébool ofﬁcials struggled to
hold classes today and some strikers
faced judges‘ rcturn-to-work orders
as walkouls by more than 32.000

teachers spread to lo states.
including Alaska.
More than 700.000 pupils

nationwide enjoyed an extended
vacation or showed for classes
taught by administrators. noti-
strikers or substitutes. somc paid as
much as $100.1 day.

One school in Daly City.
California. a suburb of San
Francisco. closed after only nine
minutes Wednesday when more
than 350 teachers struck the 0.600
pupil .lcl'lcrsonillniun High School
District.

"It looks like we have a very
effective strike.“ said Tom
Fitvpatrick of the American
Federation of 'l‘eachcrs Local Mill.

l’ickcts went around the 52 public
schools in the Anchorage. Alaska.
area Wednesday after rejection of an
offer that would bring an average
salary for the L900 teachers to

$20,979 this year. The teachers
wanted a boost to $27,944.

No further negotiations are
planned and classes for the district ‘5
38.000 pupils were conducted by
substitutes and volunteer teachers.

A New Jersey Superior Court
judge issued an order Wednesday
barring the 1.700 member Paterson
Education Association from
continuing its strike affecting about
20.500 pupils. Union ofﬁcials did
not say if they would obey the order.

In Rutliind. Vermont. a judge
Wednesday night ordered an end to
the week-long walkout by 240
teachers in Vermont's second largest
city. leachch had no comment on
the ruling. but School Board Chair

order would speed up settlement of
the ﬁ‘isputc over salary expenses.

The Oklahoma Supreme Court
refused Wednesday to tamper with a
lower court ruling barring
the Oklahoma City school board
from negotiating with striking
teachers. llut it did order a speedy
hearing on more arguctucnts in the
case. which would clear the way for
the school board to ask for an
injunction to get some 000 teachers
back to work.

Other strikes were reported
Wednesday in Connecticut. lllinois.
lndiana. Louisiana. Michigan. New
York. Ohio. Oregon and
Washington.

Strikes also spread to the

\vulkout halted about three-fourths
of Wednesday‘s first day of classes
by clerical workers disrupted
