H YPNOTIC
CONTRACEPTION?
An Italian doctor is claiming |00

pcrccnt cffcclivcncss for his new
birth control method »-— none other
than plain old hypnosis.

Dr. Marco Marchcsan. Director
of the International Center of
Medical and Psychological
Hypnosis in Milan. puts his female
patients into a deep sleep ovcr six to
cighI sessions.

During the sessions. Marchcsan
says "The conviction Is instilled in
hcr subconscious that she will not
become pregnant. even though she
takes no other precautions. Shc is
told her infertility will last
indefinitely. but she has'Ihc powcrat
any IinIc to reverse lhc process."

WAS TED SLEEP
Il' onI‘I-c one of those people who
think that sleeping is It wastc oflimc.
take hcarl: An Illinois rcscarchcr is
working on II mthod to completely
climinaic thc nchI I'III' shut—eye.
I)r. Miodrag Radulovacki.
Associatc Professor of Pharma-
cology III Ihc University of Illinois.
says that sleep may simply restore
certain chemicals as Dopamine to
thc brain that have hchI dcplctcd
during waking hours.
Radulovacki is currently
experimenting on rats and cats.
\vhosc sleep patterns are similar to
-

humans. to see whether Dopamine

could be made into a pill that would __

replenish the chemical to the br‘nin
without sleep.

Says Dr. Radulovacki. “What we
want to see is whether replenishment
of Dopamine can produce
wakefulness that will not merely
dclay sleep but will substitute for it.“

The average human being sleeps
for one third of his or her life.
Radulovacki says an anti-sleep pill
could have staggering polilical and
economic implications.

SWEAR TO IT

An Ohio researcher is suggestinga
novel method to prevent everything
froIn hivcs to heart prohlcnts.

Dr. Reinhold Aman. ihc
President of the International
Research Center for Vcrhal
Aggi‘cssiott. says you should try
swcaring.

Amati claims that cursing IIIIII
other forms of verbal aggression arc
emotionally and physically healthy
hccausc Ihcy act as a sIIIcIy valve to
relieve stress. and strcss can cause
illnesses.

AInIIn fccls a refusal to rclcasc
vcrhal aggression can lead to tension
headaches. hives. hcart ailments.
and other problems.

Says thc researcher: “A swear a
day keeps the doctor away.“
