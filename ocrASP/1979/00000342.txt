Face it. There are two ways to ride through your college
career. You can go to classes by day, study by night, in the end,
earn a degree.

Or you can do so much more, You can join the ASP, and
help make it alive. We have positions available in every
department, enabling you to use your talents, express your
thoughts, become creative, and meet a group of dedicted (and
totally insane) individuals.

80 don’t just sit there. Wouldn’t it be a shame if all you

earned was a degree?????
