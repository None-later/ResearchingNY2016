. Indianapolis (AP) in theory, there‘s
' nothing wrong with a woman trying
to play in the National Basketball

' Association. But inthe harsh,down-

to-earth reality of the sport, there
wouldn‘t seem to be a ghost of a
chance for Success on basketball
talent alone.

The Indiana Pacers, principally at

V the urging of new owner Sam Nassi,
are willing to test theory. But what's
hard to believe is their contention

V that they're dead serious.

in a much-publicized news
conference in Los Angeles on
Wednesday, Nassi and Coach
Bobby Leonard announced the
signing of former UCLA All-
America Ann Meyers. They insisted
she will get no preferential

treatment, and she will have to earn
a spot on the Pacer roster.

She was to be presented to
lndianapolis media at another news
conference today.

"l'm serious about it,"the5 foot9,
140 pound Meyers told the reporters
in Los Angeles.

“Many think that it isa gimmick.
but i think I've been given a chance
of a lifetime. This is a challenge. i
know it is unusual. but I‘ve had
dreams all my life."

Ann Meyers, regarded perhaps as
highly in California as hometown

'lcgcnd Oscar Robertson is in

lndianapolis, is a fine basketball
player. There's no question about
that. A sister of Milwaukee Bucks'
forward Dave Meyers, she was a

-, Indiana Pacers  Ann Meyers~

four-time All-American at UCLA,

’ played on the 1976 US. Olympic
team and averaged l7.4 points for
her college career.

There is no NBA policy against a
woman player, said Commissioner
Larry O‘ Brien. if her signing is to be
taken seriously, the key question is
whether she can help a club that has
yet to break even in three NBA
seasons. The Pacers claim they want
to give her the chance.

On basketball talent alone, she'
would have to Survive a brutal
physical pounding and beat out at
least ﬁve other rookies, free agents
or veterans in training. camp
beginning next Monday.

If it's a publicity stunt, Nassi must
figure the novelty ofa woman player
will help fill seats whether she plays
regularly or spends the season on the
bench. llut can the Pacers, whose
roster has been shuffled from top to
bottom in recant years, afford to
keep an unused and unusable
player?

After three years of near-

bankruptcy, Nassi's purchase put
the Pacers on solid financial footing,
but their attendance, dowa from
-l2,000 to about 9.000 last year,
could use a boost.

She will undoubtedly stay with
the team through the exhibition
season. And she will probably draw
added crowds just to see her take
pregame warmups, even if she
doesn‘t play.

Leonard's ﬁrst reaction when
approached by Nassi with the
prospect was in total opposition.
But Nassi, despite his insistence at
the time of his purchase ofthe team
that Leonard would control the
entire basketball operation, still
holds the purse strings.

Eventually, Leonard said, he
believed both Nassi and Meyers

were‘sincere. I ‘ ‘
‘ “Let‘s face it, this is.unusual.".
Leonard said Wednesday.

“l‘d be a damn fool if l'didn't
realize it. But I searched my soul and
asked if I could deny this person the
opportunity to play basketball."

The terms of the contract were not
‘accouneed, but Nassi said there
would be bonuses for making the
team, time played, and “other
considerations.” He said she would
get a non-playing job' with the
Pacers if she doesn‘t make the team.

“I think women have proven
successful 'in sports,” he said.
“Conceptualiy, this will be very
exciting. lfl didn‘t believe she had a
good chance of making our club, I -

would not have offered her the
contract." I ‘

public‘s perception of Billie Jean
King. Now she's the Old Lady. Now
she's the valiant woman who
scrapped and screamed to put
women‘s tennis on a comparable
footing with the men's game.

“People have caught up with
women's tennis," she says. "People
who used to think I was a radical
think l‘m part of the establishment
now."

And time has battered the knees
of Billie Jean King, slowed herdown
physically and let others become
champions in her place.

“l'm tired of losing," she says in
this year when she has made another
comeback from surgery. it‘s been
three knee operations now, and
most recently surgery on her heel.

“i know l'm going to have to pay
the price to keep going," she says. “If
{you ask me now, l'd say, ‘Yes, l‘m

willing to pay.‘l wantto win another
major championship — Wimbledon
or the US. Open."

The price is continual training
with weights to fortify her repaired
muscles and tendons and to keep
from lising the speed that can‘t help

but go with age.

i "Emotionally, it's a big price. It's
boring!" she complains of her strict
training regimen. "But no one makes
me do it. i want it.”

She has another shot at the title
that has been hers four times before
»— the US. championship. She and
her old rival, 34-year-old Virginia
Wade, competed for the 29th time
Wednesday in the quarterfinals of
the U.S Open, and the ninth-seeded
King beat fourth-seeded Wade 6-
3.7.6. King leads that rivalry 20-9.

Now King goes against another
four-time champion in the semis »—~
Chris Evert Lloyd. who is 24.

“It‘s important to me to win the
.mzttch, not just to think that l have
to play Chris and get through it the
best I can," she said.

It's likely she'll have the crowd
with her.

“i think people are nicer to me
because l'm older now and I haven‘t
won lately. l'd rather win and have
them against me again," she said.
"Having them for me and winning
—- that would be the ultimate.
