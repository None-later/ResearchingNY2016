New York (AP) The setting'
couldn't have been more dramatic.
Lightning ﬂashed in the distance.
Jets ﬂew through the fog overhead
with booming regularity. Raindrops
fell intermittently and a near-
capacity National Tennis Center
crowd roared with each shot. And
lurking just a few miles away was a

' tropical storm.

It was Roscoe Tanner‘s rockets.
those serves that can travel at better
than l50 mph. It was Bjorn Borg‘s

Swedish tunderbolts. at times
traveling faster then Tanner's
cannonballs.

And it was so much more. for this
was the new Tanner. the model that
covers the court like a rain squall.
volleys with precision and
constantly applies pressure.

And it was the old Borg. the

unllappable No. 1 seed and four- "

time Wimbcldon champion in quest
of the tennis Grand Slam. digging

deep. deeper into his impressive .

arsenal.

At the end. when Borg‘s backhand
service return was wide. the ﬁfth-
seeded Tanner clenched his ﬁsts
Skyward. Hurricane Roscoe had
struck Flushing Meadow. ’

Tanner, who lost a thrilling ﬁve-
set ﬁnal to Borg at Wimbledon, won .
perhaps the biggest match of his
career Wednesday in the U.S. Open.
His 6-2. 4—6. 6-2. 7-6 quarterﬁnal
victory was accomplished with the
aid of | l aces, 17 service winnersand
Tanner's unfaltering conﬁdence.

“I found out right away what I
could work," said Tanner, who until
Wimbledon had never reached the
ﬁnal in a major tournament. “It gave
me conﬁdence." -

“1 served well when l was in
trouble and that‘s what it came
down to. That and being lucky. "

Tanner appeared anything but
lucky when. serving at 5-3 in the
fourth set and after slamming his
Ilth ace ofthc match to savca break
point. one of his serves hit tlte net
and the net collapsed. A seven-
minute delay followed while a new
net was put in place.

“That gives you too much time to
sit and think." Tanner said. “All I
thought was, ‘two more accs‘f‘.

Before play resumed. Borg and
Tanner were allowed a short
warmup. They exchanged friendly

pit-pats to loosen up. then went back ,

lO WEI.
Tanner immediately hit a service
winner for his first match point.

After a long rally. Borg hit a short -

lob and Tanner extended
heavenward for the overhead smash
that would win the match.

"When I saw it. I felt very lucky."
he admitted. “Alter lhit it. I felt very
unlucky."

“I mistimed it and overhit it." he

frontrunners. Geroge Brodeur and
Mark Zoller. both have had back
trouble, and Ford has taken a good
look at JimvEsposito and Wayne
Maisch, and both “are doing a good
job.” Commenting on the offensive
line as a whole. Ford said. “There
aren‘t too many players that haVe
too mueh game experience. But
there are talented people. so it‘s just
going to be a matter of making sure
we don‘t make mistakes as we're
getting experience."
DEFENSE

Defensive Tackle: “Tackle was a
tremendous concern for us." said
Ford. “Larry Pearson was back at
one tackle, but we weren't quite sure
what was going to happen at the
other.“ Note that Ford said "was”a
concern. It has been quickly turned
into a strength with Shocn's return.
Both are outstanding. and waiting in
wings is Put Chase. :1 very capable
reserve who has also returned aftcrn
year off. Shoen has been slowed bya
broken toe. and according to
defensive coordinator Jack Scdlicki,
“has got to get out the kinks and the
rustincss. but is going to be OK and
do a great job." ’

Returning Players Should Strengthen 1979 Danes

Detensive End: Matt [intimate
and Sal lndelicato both have all the
credentials necessary to start. but
one might get bumped in favor of
Singletary. who the coaches are
raving about. "He has been one of
the more pleasant surprises of
anybody on the football team."
Ford said. “He‘is ——- at this point ——
awesome. just awesome. He's got
great quickness. speed and agility.
The defensive end position was
something we felt fairly comfortable
about before we came back. so Eric‘s
return has just solidified that
position."

Linebacker: John Veruto and
Don Hyde, and that's the name of
that tune. Both started last year. and
they complement each other
remarkably. Veruto. the larger of
the two. is the strongest player on
the team. and few ballcarricrs break
his tackles. Hyde is quicker. and
usually winds up in the right place.
With Steve Dcyand Paul O'Connor
in reserve. the Danes are set at
linebacker.

Corncrback: Returning starter
Joe Rajcwk has one corner sewed
up. and "the other spot is pretty
mtich up for grabs,“ according to

  

 

Bob Ford ‘

Ford. Five players are battling for
the spot. with Jerry Wicrzbccki
leading lltc pack. “But one player
has to really come through for that
to be a solid position for us." Ford
said.

Secondary: Stalwart Rich
Hcimcrle ltas graduated, and
replacing him will be a diflicult task.

l Daryl Haynor his back, leaving only
one space to be filled. “Don
BoWen. who started one game last
season. is the probable choice.

. Safety: Green. as in inexper-
ienced. Bruce Collins, a good athlete
with limited playing time, could
start as a sophomore. Bob Easter
and Dave Hardy were expected to
give Collins a run for his money. but
both are injured. Freshman Mark
Flanagan has been extremely
impressive in pie-season. “It's
shaky. and something has to be
done." said Sedlicki. "“ ‘ ‘,
has got to assert themselves. None of
them has proven themselves at the
varsity level..but they all have the
physical things we are looking for."

KICKING GAME
I’unter: "We do not have a great
punter.“ Ford said. “We have

'average punters." Bowen. Hardy.
and Ed Ragule are in the running,
and none has been‘ consistinﬁ
enough to win the job. '

Placekicking: Dario Arango,
whose 45 yard gield goal against
Ithaca last year made him an instant
hero. has given up tower to
concentrate fully on kicking.‘
Arango is part of what Ford calls
“the best group of kickers we've ever
had." Mike Levenatein, who
handled some kicking chores a year
ago. and Ted Shultz. a transferfrom
" " ” State, “ to give
Albany its best kicking in years.

“1 fec‘ this team is capable of
ma )1! the playoffs," added Ford.
“Wht or not we do it is another
thing. o It i think there's enough
potential. . ‘mve the makings ofa
good football u..m. But I‘m always
optimistic."
