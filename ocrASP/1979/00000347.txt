Boaters Show RevampedAttack

by Mlle‘Dunne _

The ‘I979 e'dition of the Albany
State soccer tEam promises a more
exciting offense than a year ago, as
they atteﬁtpt another assault on the
SUNYAC crown and an NCAA
playoff bid.

Evaluating a team at this point in
the pmseason is a risky business;
however it appears safe to say that
the I979 hooters have reversed the
strengths of last years 9-5-2 club
which advanced into the NCAA
playoffs and was also runner-up to
Brockport in the SUNYAC.

Last season. the Danes lived by
their defensive effortst Their ability
to defeat tough opponents while
seldom scoring more than two goals
brought them to the playoffs.

In contrast. this year's squad has
much more offensive ability. A
couple of new players acquired via
transfers have added quickness and
versatility to the forward line.

Three members of that rock solid
hackline defense of a year ago will

, not be present when the Danes meet

Plattsburgh in their season opener
next Saturday. Mark Wenzel and
defensive MVP Pepe Aguiliar were
lost to graduation. while standout
goalkeeper Dario Arango opted to
play football following his dramatic
and successful debut as a
plaeekiclrer last fall. Evidence of the
diminutive Arango's importance to
the team was that he allowed less
than one goal per game.

After missing last season with a
knee injury. Alberto Giordano is
ready to replace Arango. Head
Coach Bill Schieffelin has
proclaimed him “I000? recovered
from surgery."

Vlado Sergovich will move to
sweeper back this year after an
Injury plagued season at midﬁeld.
Returning lettermen I.uis Arango
and Alex Pagano along with
transfers Keith Falconer (Naval
Academy) and David Neville
(Oneonta) are all in contention for
the stopper and right fullback Spots.

The midﬁeld corps will be
anchored by senior Rohcrt Dahab.

He will hejoined by Alli Kamnrn. a
player who Schieffeiin describes asa
“diamond in the rough.“ Kamnm is
a senior from Africa who is trying
out for the ﬁrst time and will
probably be in the starting lineup
against Plattsburgh. Also vying for
playing time at midﬁeld will be
George Forero. Matt Parrella. and
Jack Chiarelli. whom Schieffclirt has
been impressed with during the
preseason.

The offensive attack is where the
team seems to he most improved
Despite the loss of leading scorer
and SUNYAC Ali-Star Carlos
Arango. Schieffclin feels the team
has more quickness and has looked
better on combination plays.

Sophomore Afrim Nciaj take
over the center-forward spot while
Ictterman Allen Perez and Raﬁ
Dakcssian. who played in I977. are
possibilities on the front line attack.

Schiel‘felin seems pleased with the
teams progress thus far. They
