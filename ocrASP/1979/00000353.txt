The
Friday
Afternoon
Diversion

by Vincent Aiello

There were these three men whd
were members of the French
Foreign Legion. They decided to
become deserters, tried to escape
and were caught. The punishment
for desertion was death by the
guillotine.

The first man was brought to the
guillotine and asked:

"Would you rather face the blade
or the basket?"

“The basket", the man answered.

He was placed on the guillotine
facing the basket when the
executioner released the blade.
Miraculously the blade stopped one
inch above his neck.

The executioner said, “under

French law you must be free."

And so he was.

The second man also said he
preferred to face the basket. Once
again they attempted to chop his
head oil but the blade stopped right
above his neck.

He too was set free.

The third man when asked which
way he would like to face chose to
face the blade.

He was placed on the guillotine
looking towards the sky as the
executioner was right about to
release the blade.

“Hold it!" the man cried out, “I
think 1 see your problem.”

Friday, Sept. 7, 1979 .' _

 

by Paul Schwartz

When last season ended. it
appeared the 1979 Albany State
- football team had little chance to
, equal the feats of the 1978 squad.
No less than 16 starting players
graduated. including virtually the
entire offensive and defensive lines,
and the 7-3 record of a year ago
seemed almost too much to ask. But
‘ with three outstanding performers
back in uniform after a one-year
hiatus. the prospects for this year‘s
team havu improved immensly.

“I guess I have mixed emotions
about this year's tcum."said Albany
State head football coach Bob
Ford. “We lost 16 starters. so we lost
a healthy nucleus out of last year's
team. At the same time I guess I
have to say I'm cautiously optimistic
about this coming season. We hnvcu
good group of new people that have
come in, and I think we have the
potential of having a very. very
competitive tcum again this year."
' The driving forces for Ford's
‘cautious optimism" are three
mcmbcrs of thc I977 Danc squad
that came within one game of
playing for the national
championship. Shcvc Shocn and
Eric Singlctury left school last year,
while Sam Huliston chose not to
play. All three have returned. and
add talent the Danes had not
counted on. '

In Haliston and Shocn. Albany
gains simply their two best players
from two years ago. Both were
named outstanding athlete.
Haliston on offense and Shocn on
‘ defense. From his defensive tackle
position. Shoen led the 1977 Danes
in tackles and quarterback sacks,
and was voted the Times Union
Areas Collcgc Player ofthc Year. “If
Stcvc can pick up where he left off."
said Ford, “he will be one of the
premier Division III tackles."

lialiston was Albany‘s leading
rushcr in 1977 with 940 yards,
including a 99—yard jaunt against
Norwich. “In his sophomore year.
Sam was probably one of the batter
Division III running bucks in the
nation." Ford said. Although he is

strength in his legs and upper body.
and also has the quickness to be
considered a breakaway threat.

The third player to make his way
back to the Danes is not comparable
to Ilaliston and Shocn as far as
actual game contributions. but
nevertheless remains a potential star
performer. Arriving at Albany after
a stellar high school career.
Singlctary “had a good freshman
year. but then his sophmorc year he
really tailed off." according to Ford.
This prc-scuson. though, Singlulury
has looked extremely impressive.

opcner at Hobart next Saturday.
Before the Middlcbury scrimmage.
here is n position~by~posilion
outlook on the 1979 Danc football
squad.
OFFENSE

Quarterback: For the first Iimc in
a few years. Ford has decided on his
starting quarterback well before the
first game. “Looking back. the last
three years we have had grcul
competition at the quurlcrhack
spot," Ford said. “We did not
solidify it for u long period of time.
and thch were cases that even
during the your the position wus not
sulldlfiL‘d. I think the advantage of
having it quurtcrhuck sclcctcd u
curly us you can is that the lcum
rullics around that person and gains
greater confidence in him And the
person cun guin CUIllltIan'L' too.“

On opt-Hing day. it will be ’Icrry
Walsh culling signth for Alhuny.
After splitting time with Iirutl
Aldrich lust scusnn. Wnlsh has now
ussumcti the job. and his
qualihculiom include an uncanny
ability to wcuvc around dulcndcrs
while running with the hull. “'l crry is
tinexceptionallydcccplivc runner
he might be the best running
qunrtcrhuck we've ever hurl."

commcnlcd l-otd. "He's 21 good
pithth Illltl he understands our
offense fairly well. Ilc's well

rcapcclcd by the tcnrn. nnd I've got
grunt confidence in him."

Iichind Walsh is Mike l-iorito,
who was in the running for the
number one spot ut lIlL' beginning of
IIIL‘ prc-scuson. until shoulder and
neck injuries set him back. “Mike is
technically extremely sound and it
good quarterback in his own right,"
snid Ford. “1 think it's importth
lhut Mikc get ltculthy and is ublc to
keep the pressure on ’l‘crgy, and I
don't mean that in any vicious-type
wuy. It's just. that I think all of us
have a tendency to be a little lazy.
and 'I'crry could let up without Mike
being there to press him. It's human

MKMMO

  

nature to let up a little bit."

Halfbnck: The return of Hulislon
prcscnls a pleasant problem: Two
starting spots and three quality
runners. It is a dilemma that Ford
will happily have to live with. “When
we camc into this year." Ford said.
"halfback was not a prime concern
for us. We have Levi Louisund Jnck
Iturgur back. but Sum certainly
makes that a much more
competitive spot. and there's no
question he's given us it tremendous
running threat."

Louis came into his own as u
runncr lust scuson. amassing 767
yards. including at 203 yard ussuult
nguinst ('ortlnnd. In and out ofthc
lineup lust your due to injuries.
liurgcr has been hampered with n
“’r 7 " ﬁ 2; I. . s.’

I Coach Bob Ford: “I’m Cautiously Optimistic” 

ripped tissue in his thumb so far, but
because of his natural athleticabilily
will still be pressing for the starting
slot. In addition. sophomores
Chuck Priorc and Dave Wurhitc

.both have solid credentials and'
should providcqpalitydcpth. Priorc _

managed to score a touchdown in
every JV game a year ago. while
'WﬂrllllC'S 46 yard burst against
Towson was instrumental in
Albany's 37-28 victory last year.

Fullback: Can anyone rcplacc
Mikc Mirabella and his 933 yards?
Probably not. The two leading
candidates are John Durant and
Bruce Churcltwcll. A transfer from
Dunn Junior College. where he was
the stnrting fullback. Durant has the
edge at hallcurrying. while
(’hurchwcll. u converted halfback.
has shown to be in stronger blocker.
“To stay in the wishbone. you mu,
have an inside running threat that
can stop the defense from ilying to
the outsldc."suid Ford. “and I think
we will have that. We won't have
that added punch lhut Mirabella
gnvc us. but I feel comfortable and
confident with both our fullbacks.“

Tight 13nd: (ionc is last year‘s
leading rcccivcr lid Sellers. and his
buck-up. Bruce Duy. inherits the
job. Solid for the position physically
(6‘3". 200). Day is a confident

blocker. but is onlyun adequate puss
catcher and must work on his
concentration, according to Ford.
Split End: Last year's split end is
this year's split cnd  Scott Lusher.
Possessing grcat hands and speed,
Lushcr should figure to bc Walsh's
prcmicr I’L’CCIVCY. g

Ccnlcr: Mike Arcuri, Inst year's
backup.- sccms to have a slight
advantage over Tom Clark. the
starting JV ccntcr onc year ago.
Ford says he feels “comfortablL-"al
this spot.

(iuurd: Four pluycrsurc vying for
the two starting berths. with (ilcnn
Mugrunc and Tom Scarpinuto
holding the upper hunds. Both huvc
had some experience at the position
from lust season.

Offchsivc 'l’ucklc: "Without a
doubt. it is our biggest question
