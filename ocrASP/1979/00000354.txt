“Tire Chinese are interested in
how to absorb a great deal in a short
period of time.“ said O'Leary.

The delegation first visited the
University of Peking. where the
delegation gave a series oflectures to
faculty and students.

Officials ofthe Peking Ministry of
Education met with the delegation
to discuss speciﬁc goals relating to
the interchange.

"It was at the University of
Nanking that the ﬁrst formal
exchange agreements were
developed." said O'l.cary.

The second set ofagreements were
made at the next stop of the tour.

“If everything moves along
rapidly. we could begin the problem

rapidly. we could begin the program
this January." he said. The exchange
could involve as rniiny as sixteen
students.

O‘Leary.

“One of the things that struck me
was the age ofthe people in positions
of authority in the administration
and faculty." said the Director ofthc
institute for Humanistic Studies
M.E. Grenadcr. “Most ofthem were
in their sixties. seventies. and even
eighties.“

The delegation also took note of
the change in the People‘s Republic
higher education. Up until I977,
undergraduate admissions to
Chinese universities were based on
political inﬂuence. In the past two
years. they have changed over to a
system of admission based on
academic merit. “somewhat like our
college boards." said O'Leary.

'l'he SUNYA Chinese Studies
Department has added three new
courses this semester. designed to
fantiliariye potential exchange
students with the Chinese culture.
There will be a number of students
lrorn many American universities
and “we'd like ours to be the best
prepared." said (’Iien.

Participating (‘hinese universities
have set up an intensive one month
program to teach incoming
American students the lundamen-
tats ol the (‘hincsc language. The
program consists of basic classroom
instruction in the iirnining. lectures
on aspects of Chinese life by various
luminaries iii the afternoon. and
exposure to Chinese culture. such as

ballet. plays. and ﬁlms in the
_ evening.

"Students live the content of what

the language is all about," said
