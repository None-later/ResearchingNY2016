Meteors May Contain Organic Life

WASHINGTONtAP) Scientists
have found the chemical precursors
of life in two rare meteorites
discovered in Antarctica. giving
strength to the idea that life could
have developed elsewhere as well as
on Earth. they say. '

Dr. Cyril Ponnamperuma.

director of the University of’

Maryland's Laboratory obeemical
Evolution, also said the findings add
weight to the theory that life on
Earth began through a chemical
percolation in primordial oceans
billions of years ago.

In results reported today at the
national meeting of the American
Cancer Society. Ponnamperuma
and his colleagues also said they
have evidence there may have been
life on Earth as early as 3.83 billion
years ago.

Organic material called
hydrocarbons have been discovered
in sedimentary rocks found in the
lsua region of Greenland. This 3.8}
billion-year-old material is more
than 400 million years older than
previous evidence of life found in
rocks in South Africa and Canada.
he said.

THE
CUTTERY

"We think we have found the
oldest evidence for life on Earth."he
told a news brieﬁng. “and that oldest
evidence is in the oldest rocks yet
found."

This means life could have started
earlier in Earth's history than many
scientists previously believed. he
added.

Speaking of the other ﬁndings.
Ponnampcruma said the well
preserved Antarctic meteorites
contained amino acids — carbon
compounds that are the building
blocks of proteins —» that are not of I
Earthly biological origin.

The scientist said the rare
meteorites. called carbonaccotgs
chondritcs, are 4.6 billion years old
 the same age as the solar system
and the Earth. These space rocks
which later fell to Earth
are remnants of the same material :
from which the solar system
evolved. he added.

l’onnampcruma said sumc oftlic
amino acids found in the meteorites
are chemically different from the
types that make up proteins in living
organisms. showing that they did\
not come from known living

processes.

“The ﬁnding gives credence to the
idea that the chemical evolutionary
process postulated for Earth has
taken place elsewhere.“ he told the
brieﬁng.

"Amino acids don't deﬁnitely
mean there is life somewhere else.
but it increases the chances of there
being life somewhere else." he

added.

Evidence of pro-biological
processes building complex
chemical molecules strengthens the
"primordial soup" theory. which
holds that lifeless chemicals came
together in pools on early Earth and
may have formed pro-life molecules
with the aid of lightning or another
stimulant. Ponnampcruma said.

Council Eases Judicial Guidelines

right of a student to consult with his
adviser during the proceedings, and
that his adviser may be an attorney.
Ncwmark said that until the
guidelines were revised. one
quadrangle forbade a student‘s right
to representation by a lawyer.
Newmark claims that these new
privilegcs make judicial board
hearings fairer to students by
closing the door to arbitrary
practices and guaranteeing a
student‘s right to representation.
