people may discover problems with
the tests," Malkin said. “It‘s possible
the testing companies aren't always
testing what they claim to be
testing,"

Because of the disclose
provisions, the medical and dental
school udmission tcsts (MCAT and
DAT) will not be given in New York
in 1980.

“The disclosure portion ofthc law
gives us large problems.“ said Dr.
Robert Bcran of the Association of
American Medical Colleges,
administering agency for the
medical school tests. “We have a
rather narrow range from which to
draw questions."

problems we're facing," said Parry
Sheehy, an ETS spokeswoman.
“We‘ll have to hire more staff to
write new questions.“ ETS now
relies largely on banks ofquestions it
has developed over a long period of
time.

, According to Malkin. the law
which enjoyed the support of Ralph
Nader‘s Washington-based
consumcr group. was drafted
because ofcomplaints from students
about the testingagcncies. In spite of
heavy lobbying efforts by the testing
industry, it passed both houses of
the state legislature last session by a
substantial margin.

A key factor in its passage was a
Federal Trade Commission report
issucd earlier this year, which found
that commercial coaching schools

raised the scores of some students
taking the Scholastic Aptitude-Test
(SAT). A major claim of the bill's
supporters was that publicizing the
questions would permit all students
to become familiar with the tests,
notjust those who can afford to take
a coaching course.

That argument is not accepted by
state Sen. Hugh Farley, a SUNYA
professor who led the floor ﬁght
against the bill. .

“They're hurting the Very students
they're trying to help," Farley said.
“This law sets up a curriculum for a
coaching school. They‘re actually
making things worse."

Stanley Kaplun. founder of the
largest and most successful test
preparation organization in the
country. acknowledged that
disclosing test questions and
'answcrs could cause a rapid growth
in the number of crnm schools. Still

he claimed the most important
aspect in preparing for a *
standardized test it to focus on
topics, not try to recreate the actual
questions.

“it‘s not the questions

you develop the process of
answering.”
