BASTERS' CHOICE?

‘ Say goodbye to your hot tubfthc
newest fad on the health' and
relaxation scene has been
inadvertently stumbled upon in
Japan.

What could be better than a hot
tub. you ask'.’ Well. how about
steeping yourself in a bath of
fermenting coffee grinds'.’ '

It seems a Japanese researcher
had five tons of coffee beans in his
laboratory when a l_\phnnn hit.
When he started to clean up the mess
later. he discovered that his hands
and feet felt good when they were
inserted in the mess.

According to Chemical and
Engineering News. so far everyone
who has tried it likes it. and the
coffee bath is being credited for
helping a miriad ofailments. There's
just one question: Will the baths also.
keep the users uwake'.’

-NO A VERA GE NUKE

Who are anti-nuclear demonstra-
tors?

A survey by three sociologists of
demonstrators at the May 61h anti-
nuclear rally in Washington. DC
has found that anti-nuclear activists

are not just an isolated group of “

people. but that they comprise
"People and groups in many parts of
the country who are forming an
effective communications network
and increasing political clout.“

I The three'sociologists distributed
lOOO questionnaires to randomly
chosen individuals at the May 6th
rally. Their survey revealed that the
demonstrators were predominantly

young. well-educated. liberal and
from urban areas; that nearly two-
thirds of those interviewed had
travelled more than l00 miles to
attend the rally: and that only 42
percent belonged to organizations
opposed to nuclear power.

Most of the demonstrators. the

study learned. had been involved in
other movements such as the
Vietnam War and Civrl Rights. hut
hand never participated in an anti-
nuclear demonstration before. Yet.
90 percent of those questioned said
they wanted all nuclear plants shut
down.

The study concluded that the
widely-publicivcd accident last
March at Three Mile Island was
instrumental- in fueling activism
against nuclear power throughout

the llnitcd States.

STOMP THERAPY

There are a whole mess of bones in your feet.

F ifty-two to be exact.

To take proper care of all of them, you need a good
pair of shoes.

Like the one you see below. A Rockport. _

That bottom is not one big hunk of crepe. It’s elght
separate layers. This makes the bottom softer. More
ﬂexible. Easier on your feet.

And that shoe won’t rub your foot the wrong way,
either. Because inside is a full leather lining that’s been
specially tamed to make it soft and comfy.

Slip your feet (ale or female) into a pair

of Rockports.

They’ll follow you
anywhere.

A MORE MELLOW
MICKEY MOUSE

Mickey Mouse isn't what he used
to be.

This is according to Harvard
University biologist Stephen Jay
Gould.

Gould says since Mickey Mouse‘s
birth 50 years ago. the famous
rodent's behavior has become more
and more benign and childlike as his
popularity as a national symbol has
increased.

For example. says (loultl. the
original Mickey Mouse "was a
rarnbunetious. even slightly sadistic
fellow“ who pummclletl. squcc/cd.
and twisted other animals in his
early cartoons.

Now. however. (iould sa ..

 

’ Mickey has become more childlike
and less cruel. to addition, the
professor says. Mickey's actual
physical appearance has become
more baby-like. with a larger head.
pudgier legs and baggier clothes
than he had in the old days.

Gould says the change in Mickey's
appearance and manner mimics a
current tendency among Americans
to feel more affection and tenderness

— and less antagonism —— toward
the young.

DOOMED DOLLAR

The new Susan B. Anthony one-
dollar coin is apparently bombing
everywhere ~ even in Susan ll.
Anthony’s home town.

Despite repeated promotions on
behalf ofthe new dollar in the town
of Adams. Massachusetts. the coins
are not being used there.

Last July. then-Secretary of the
Treasury. W. Michael Blumcnthul.
traveled to Adams to dedicate the
new dollar formally in that
community. Since that time, thr-
Adams Chamber of Commerce has
been trying to push the dollar h;
having women —-— dressed as Susan
Anthony wandering along tllr’
streets and exchanging the coins for
paper bills.

At lttst report. however. Adam.-
sltoppers still wcrcn't using lhl
coins. Stores in Adams say all the)
ever see are paper dollars —~ and n:

A GOOD CRY

Researchers at the University in!
Minnesota Medical School haw.
been conducting a series of“crying"
experiments in efforts to learn “in
human beings shed tears \ licn tln-j.
are sad.

The publication Behavior 'l'mlm
reports that the latest ﬁndings lcml
to support an old medieval theory
that crying is one wayfor the body to
get rid of so-callcd “had humors."
The Minnesota research learn has
reportedly found that the tears
produced by crying carry toxic
materials from the body.

The researchers are said to ht
analyzing the differences between
tears that result front emotional
upsets and those produced wlter‘
external pollutants irritate the eyes.
Volunteers are being paid $l0 for
"two good cries."

ZOOM
Officials with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration —» along with
several private drug experts —- say
that a new drug from Brazil that is
selling like crazy in U.S. health food
stores consists almost solely of
' caffeine.
The drug. which some allege to be
a stimulant similar to cocaine. is
being sold tinder the brand name
"Zoom." Health food stores around
the United States report they have
been selling out of $9.95 bottles of
the tablets as fast as they can stock
than
7hr Los Ange/es Times says that
drug experts at Harvard. U.C.l..A.
and the F.D.A. all agree on one
thing as far as “Zoom” is concerned:
it is said to be made up almost
entirely of caffeine. Several tablets
reportedly are equal to a strong cup
of coffee.
