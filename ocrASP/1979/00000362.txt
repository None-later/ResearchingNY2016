OJ. Simpson ‘ Stages Comeback

' - N FRANCISCO (AP) The most
mous orange juice salesman in
I erica was open over the middle.
d there came the ball. zipping
er so close and then slicingawny as
threw up his hands to the groans
50.000 fans.
“The old OJ. would have had it."
re than one person muttered.
d maybe he would have.
But chances are that even the
rrent Orenthal James Simpson. a
ttlc-scarred legend who hadn‘t
nyed football for the San
ancisco 49ers since last Nov. 5.
old have had it ifhe had been able
practice more.
“OJ. hasn't worked on pass
tterns as much as we'd liked and
lined up incorrectly on the play.“
mittcd Coach Bill Walsh after
tcliing Simpson's return to action
nday in the 49ers 2l—l.'l National
r otbull League loss to Dallas.

 
   
 
   
 
   
   
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

"That meant he got too far upﬁeld
for the pass and it fell in behind him.
But overall I feel very positive about
O.J.'s performance.“

So did the man himself.

“I needed the work." Simpson
said after carrying the ball l4 times
for 43 yards. catching two short
passes and scoring a touchdown. “I
just wish We had run more. The holes
were there. which is a lot different
than last year. At no time last year
would I have said. ‘Hey. let's run the
ball more.‘ "

Simpson. one of life‘s eternal
optimists. has had little to smile
about since coming back to play in
his hometown in I978. First. he
endured the pain of a bad knee
through 10 games with a dreadful
team before injuring his shoulder
and missing the rest of last year.

Then he had off-season knee
surgery and was still recuperating

slowly last month when his baby
daughter drowned. He was away
from the team for |0 days and was
only activated at mid-week.

But when the 49ers took the field
for the first time Sunday. the man
who has run for more than two miles
in the NFL was in the backfield."

He got the call on the second play
from scrimmage. Maybe the old
speed wasn‘t there and maybe he
wasn‘t so surefooted anymore. but
he gained 7 yards around right end
and the crowd cheered. He got 5
more around left end the next time
he carried and 4 more the next time.

After the third curry. he came off
the field. limping ever so slightly.
and sat on the bench. As the game
wore on. he still appeared to favor
the tender right knee.

But there were ﬂashes of the old
O.J. Like a pair of 7-ynrd runsund a
dive through the inside hole to set up
the 49ers‘ only touchdown. which he
scored from the l-yurd line a play
later.

 

Then there was that thirquuarter
pass. the one that got away.

“ltjust faded away and I couldn‘t
get it.“ Simpson said wistfully. "It‘s
too bad because it's not every day
that you get open like that.

“But other than some stiffness

  

when l was on the sidelines, my knee
didn‘t bother me. I think I’m as.
quick as I ever was.

“It was fun out there. even if we
lost. I told defensive coordinator Pat
Studley at halftime. ‘I really do love
this game.‘ It‘s a great game."
