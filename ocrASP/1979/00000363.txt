University Gaines Begin; «
, American Effort Improves

MEXICO CITY (AP) Althougl
it‘s highly unlikely the powerful
Russians will be overtaken. the
United States seems certain of
producing its best effort ever in the
World University Games. . I

With four days of competition
remaining in the multiple-sport
biennial games for college-age
athletes. the Americans have won l5
gold medals and 4l overall. Their
best previous effort - and the only
other line they‘d sent a full
delegation - was two years ago in
Bulgaria where they won 19 gold
and 43 medals overall.

But the Russians. who have won
at least won gold medal in every

total count of 26-56 through the
events of Sunday night and now
appear certain of making a
successful defense of their overall
championship. Romania is third in
the 95-nation competition with ll-
23.

Most of the American medals -
l4 gold and 36 total -came from the
swimmers, who concluded their 26-
event competition Sunday night. It
was a spectacular performance from
a team that was lacking most ofthe
country's premier performers.

McEnroe particularly is a
phenomenon of the age. When has
the game seen a younster with such

It was the prissy British press that
labeled him "Supcrbrat" because of
his youthful intensity and arrogance

AregMcEnroe And Austin
The Best In The World?

NEW YORK (AP) They are so
young and so good. You‘d think.
though. that there would be some
sort of youthful uncertainty. some
remnant of adolescent self doubt.

llut then l6-ycar-old Tracy
Austin and 20-year-old John
McEnroe are the champions of one
of the two most prestigious tennis
tournaments in the world -— the
US. Open. And they didn't get that
way by being usual. I

You ask Austin if she now has
claim to No. l. and she replies
carefully: “That's reaching a little
bit. It‘s very close. though. I might
be No. 2. It might be Martina. me.
then Chrissie."

What“!

Yes. after heating four-time titlist
Chris Evert Lloyd in the final.

Austin has some basis for asserting
supremacy. Lloyd for the first year
in her career has not won a major
championship. Austin's 6-4. 6-3
victory Sunday was her third over
the 24-year-old Lloyd. who for years
ruled tennis the way Austin
probably will. Martina Navratilova
won Wimbledon for a second year.
but Austin beat her in the
semifinals here.

She now is the youngest person to
win the open.

And McEnroe. of course. wasn't
feigning modesty.

“I consider myselfon a given day
the hest,"he said after beating fellow

New Yorker Vilas Gcrulaitis 7-5, 6-

3. 6.3 for the men's title. "But I think
llorg is the best player in the world
for the year.

“But I think I‘m No. 2 or J." The
computerized rankings made by the
men 's and women's associations ﬁnd
Austin and McEnroe ranked No. 3
in the world. but when new ratings
come out they are likely to move up.
And the future will be a more open
battle between Navratilova. Lloyd.
and Austin on one side. and between
Bjorn Borg. Connors. and McEnroe
on the other. Borg. the four-time
Wimbledon champ lost in the
quarterﬁnals in the Open.

Unqucstionably. tennis'
has started.

In fact. the Open ﬁnals only
brought more clearly into focus the
picture that began to glimmer at
Wimblcton two years ago.
McEnroe. at l8. became the
youngest man to reach the
Wimbledon semis. when: he bowed
to Jimmy Connors. And Austin. at
l4. got to the quarters, where she

lost to a scared Lloyd who was then
Evert.

Now they are both cool.
knowledgeable rcgulurs on their
respective tours. V

Austin will gladly and glibly rattle
off analyses of her colleagues“
playing styles. McEnroe knows the
men‘s game inside and out.

Just as Lloyd made people
uncomfortable with her coolness
and steadiness. Austin will put off
some with licr self-assurance and
mental toughness. I loyd grew to be
a graceful compctitor and a gracious
woman. Austin. who's bccornc
about six times more talkative in the
last two years. shows signs that she
will mature similarly.
