(AP) Southern California‘s top-
ranked Tojans won the ﬁrst battle.
Now it remains to be seen of they can
go on and win the war.

Pyrrhus doesn’t play for these
men of Troy and it was not
immediately known how many
injured warriors will be hale and
hearty for next w'eek‘s Oregon State
game or whether Saturday night's
2l-7 season's-opening triumph over
Texas Tech was a pyrrhic victory.

The Trojans lost All-America
tailback Charles White shoulder
injury. mammoth tackle Anthony
Munoz knee. center Chris Foolte
leg and rover Ronnie Lott shoulder.

“We lost White and Munoz in the
ﬁrst half and l was starting to say.
‘Oh my God.‘ but my team kept
playing." said Coach John
Robinson.

Among the players were full-back
Marcus Allen. who rushed for I05
yards and scored on a l-yard run.
and quarterback Paul McDonald.
who passed for two second-half
touchdowns.

“I don’t know whether White will
play next week." Robinson said. The
l’ac-IO‘s career rushing king was
Iiurt after gaining 39 yards on I0
carries.

Second-ranked Alabama. college
football‘s defending national
champion. got rolling after a
sluggish start and whipped Georgia
Tech 30-6. E.J. Junior returned and
interception 59 yards for the ﬁrst
score while Major Ogilvie. Steve

defense had a shutout until only [2
seconds remained.

Was Bear Bryant dissappointed?

"Yes. We didn't score every time
we got the ball and we didn't stop
them every time they got it."

Oklahoma. Texas and Penn

There were three upsets in the Top

the biggest. Roch Hontas passed for

Scrimmages are hard to ﬁgure
out. Last year. the Albany State
football squad faced Middlebury in
a final tuneup before the season
opener. and the Danes thoroughly
dominated. running through.
around. and over their opponents.
The next week. Albany showed
pructicrtlly nothing on offense. and
managed only eight points in a loss
to Kings Point.

On Saturday. the Danes again
went against Middlebury in a ﬁnal
scrimmage. And like last year.
Albany would have to be considered
the runaway "winner.“although the
scrimmage did not take the form of
an actual game. Whether Saturday‘s

Danes Impressive In Scrimmage

opening game against Hobart will
follow the same pattern as last year
remains to be seen.

Each squad ran about l30
offensive plays. which is far more
than an ordinary contest. and at the
end of the afternoon. the Danes
scored 53 points. compared to 2l for
Middlebury.

“Overall. I would say that I am
very pleased with our performance
in the scrimmage."said Albany head
football coach Bob Ford. “We
moved the ball decently on offense.
rind we did an adequate job on
defense. Middlebury is an excellent
college football team. I would say
that at the end of the season they
have no more than two losses."

One area which appears to be set
is the quarterback position. Both
Terry Walsh. team tri-captain and
starting signal-callerI and Mike
Fiorito “looked very good and threw
very well." according to Ford.
Fiorito. coming off neck and
shoulder injuries. is the number-two
man behind Walsh. ,

Another player who Ford felt
stood out against Middlebury was
Glenn Magrane. whose perfor-
mance was good enough to nail
down one starting guard spot.

Ford was not pleased with what
he called a “lack ofexplosion"by the
offense. In particular. it was the
offensive line that did not "explode
off the ball." according to Ford.

“It looks like the teams are
throwing more effectively. but I still
feel defense is the key. Our defense
has to get better aitd better each

said. “That‘s no apology."

Bruce. who favors a more open
attack than the Buckeyes had under
Hayes. is not entirer happy with the
team's aerial weapons.

“Our passing is not as crisp and
