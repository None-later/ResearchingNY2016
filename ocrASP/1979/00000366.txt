Tuesday. September It, 1979

 

 

by Paul Schwartz

Turn your attention. ifyou will. to
the Albany State men's tennis team
of a year ago. Remember the ll-2
fail and spring record. the second
place ﬁnish in the SUNYAC. and
the triumph over the powerful
Division i Massachusetts. Fond
memories. all.

Now, return to the present. to the
l979 Albany tennis squad. Look at
all the new players. See that only
three of them are back from last
year's' team. Cringe when you hear
that four of the Danes top ﬁve
players are among the missing.

Be surprised when you realize that
this year's squad might do as well as
last years.

it‘s true. Despite the changes.
Albany could again ltavc another
strong tennis team. And there are a
great deal of changes that will be
evident when the Danes open up
their fall season at Oneonta
tomorrow.

At the top of the list is Bob Lewis..

the Danes long-time coach. Today.
Lewis will undergo an operation on
a ruptured disc in his lOWer back.

period of time. in his absence. the

John Lieberman. a senior who last

As far as personnel goes. the

man on the Albany tennis scene for
the past four years. As a player. he
had a lock on the top spot in the
lineup. and as a leader. he always
could call on his superlative play to
serve as an example.

Graduation also claimed Albany‘s
four and five singles players. Mike
Fertig and Andy Antosyk. but
perhaps the loss that will hurt the
most is the departure of Lane
Lerner. As a freshman a year ago.
Lerner teamed with Fcldman to
form the Dane's number-one
doubles team. and Lerner also had
an outstanding rookie season as the
third singles player. However.
Lerner chose to transfer to the
University of Pennsylvania. where
the level of tennis competition is at
the Division i level.

So instead. the revamped Danes
will feature one established star
performer. one upstart freshman
loaded with talent. and a supporting
cast that could possibly represent
tnore depth than the l978 squad.

The star that should shine the
brightest for Albany this season is
Larry Linett. After an exceptional
campaign at number-two singles a
year ago. Linctt assumes the top
position that he would have '
occupied on most other teams. This
seemed to be the most obvious of
moves until a newcomer emerged to
challenge Linett.

Barry Levine. a freshman from
Roslyn Heights. joined the Danes
with impressive credentials. He was
the number-one singles player on his
high school team for two years. won
the New York State Doubles title.
and most recently. captured first
place in the Hempstead Lake Open.
a tournament made up chieﬂy of
men older than Levine. Upon
arriving at Albany. Levine was
slated for the number-two spot

behind Linett.

However. Levine has been so
impressive in prc-season play that he
proved a formidable opponent for
Linett. The battle for ﬁrst singlcs
reached a climax of sorts yesterday.
wltcn the two squared off to
determine who should hold the top
position. Linctt jumped all over his

federal Department of Housing and

According to Dean for Student

applied for a $5 million College
Housing Program loan in an
attempt to case the student housing
shortage that occurs each fall.

HUD‘s offer appeared in the July ‘

the large number of students who
are "irtadcquatcly housed."

"The definition of ‘inndcquatcly

said Kircltncr. “Perhaps the most
objective is the response to an Off

like ‘do you think that you are

Others considered "inadequately
housed“ include those living in
increased occupancy roorrts on
campus. in temporary facilities
(lounges, RA suilcrooms. or
temporarily staying with friends off
campus). and in certain Albany
neighborhoods.

“By not very objective criteria
we‘ve determined some areas of the
city are less desirable titan others."
said Kircliticr.

at the 440 occupancy figure.

There will be considerable
competition for the loans. as HUD is
making available a total of only $95

fixed costs ($2,570,000) and
program increases (Sl.000.000).
Fixed costs include such areas as
automatic salary adjustments and

“This ar‘a reflects inflationary
trends such as increases in minimunt

gasoline rates." Brink said. “Funds

academic programs. as well as the
salaries of six new faculty and six

he said. “If a program does not get

Because of New York State's
fiscal environment. SUNYA has not
been expanding programs and has
had to eliminate some positions and

other SUNY schools. SUNY/Bing-

have applied for the loans.

“There have been considerable
negotiations as to what sort of
housing deficit we could
demonstrate.annbsolutcly provable
deficit.“ said Assistant Dean for
Strident Affairs llcnry Kirchner.

The most important question by
HUD concerns whctlicr SUNYA
will need increased student housing
facilities in the future.

“We will continue in the future to
house a large portion of our strident
population." said Kirchner. “it‘s rtot

Kirchner. “i think they believe part-
tirnc students tend to be local people
who live at home."

By l‘)lil. Kirchner expects to
house 55% of SUNYA‘s full-time
enrollment. This represents an
increase of l% to 2% over rcccnt
years. He expects this moderating
trend to corttinuc throughout the
eighties.

Brown and Kirchner explained
the proposed housing project as
consisting of 8 garden apartment—
style buildings on floors each. Each
building would contrrin 55 bed
spaces.
