Holds 119 Hostage

BONN. West Germany (AP) A
young man hijacked a West German
jetliner in flight. held out in a day-
long standoff at the Bonn airport
insisting that the nation hear his
demands for “a humane world."
then surrendered Wednesday night.

The hijacker freed the ll9 other
passsengers and four of the eight
crew members unharmed seven
hours after the Lufthansa Boeing
727 landed at Bonn-Cologne
Airport. but Iiad kept l'our crew
members aboard the plane.
demanding to talk to Chancellor
llelmut Schmidt and a television

tions begun with the crew radioing
the hijacker‘s demands to
Wischnewski in the tower.

Ham radio operators who listened
in on communications between the
cockpit and airport tower said the
man read a 20-minute political

manifesto demanding a West
German referendum on nuclear
power. improved child care and
abolition of the armed forces.

“All I want is a humane world in
which it is worthwhile to live." he
was quoted as saying. He

complained that, cit-convicts are
marked for life because of certain
entries in their identification
documents. After reading his
statement. he freed the I23 hostages.

In negotiations that followed,
Wischnewski asked the man “to be
humane himself" and release the rest
of the crew. Cesarz said.

“The crew is free. I only have a toy
pistol.“ Cesarz quoted the hijacker
as replying . Wischnewski then
agreed to meet the hijacker aboard
the plane.

Wischnewski told reporters
prcpartttions had been made to end

... .. . ..........,._........_ .-.;-4.,....... ,..

i

the hijacking by other means if the.
talks failed. He did not elaborate.

It was not known where the
hijacker boarded the flight.
Lufthansa officials said both the

- passengers who boarded in
Frankfurt and the few continuing on
to Bonn-Cologne from Paris
underwent security checks.

Cesarz said the man went to the
front toilet carrying a black
briefcase and an airsickness bag, and
from there entered the cockpit.
Passengers told reporters the man
had faked illness and at his request
was seated up front.
