Not Prescribed For Stress

WASHINGTON (AP) A psychia-
trist who has treated celebrities for
alcohol and drugabuse told a Senate
health subcommittee Monday that
the most widely used drug in
America - valium ~ isaddictivc and
should not be prescribed for
everyday stress.

Dr. Joseph Purseli. head of the
Alcohol Rehabilitation Service at
the Navy‘s Long lieach Regional
Medical Center in California. said
alcoholism and the overuse of
tranquili/ers represent the nation's
No. 1 health problem.

“Classically today, if a woman
walks into her doctor‘s office and
says, ‘I‘m nervous. my husband
drinks too much.‘ the doctor will
automatically give her a
tranquilircr," said the Navy
psychiatrist. whose patients have
included liilly Carter. the president‘s
brother; Mrs. Betty Ford. the
former president‘s wife; and Sen.
Herman 'l'almage. D-(ia.

More than 44.6 million Valium
prescriptions were filled in I978.
And. I’ursch said. many doctors
don‘t realize that patients can get

hooked on Valium. Librium and
other mild tranquilirers.

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. the
subcommittee chairman, asked if
Valium alone is a problem in society.
Purseli replied he ltas seen people
who have become addicted to the
tranquilirer in only six weeks.

“None of these drugs. Valium and
Librium. solve our problems.“ said

’ I’ureh. “They make people feel

better because they make you feel
dull and insensitive. But they don‘t
solve anything."

lint Robert Ii. Clark. president of
Hoffmann-la Roche luc.. the

manufacturers of Valium.
maintained it is a safe and effective
drug when properly used. He said
uddiction is “extremely rare" at
recommended dosage levels. and
added that Valium does not appear
to be more addictive than any other
mild tranquilizcr.

The vast majority of patients on
Valium use it for only a short time
and follow their doctor's
instructions. Clark said. having no
problem with the drug. '

He added. however. that Roche
will begin a new program to make
certain information on the risks and
beneﬁts of Valium is included in
each container for the patient to
read.

Clark said the effort may hurt
Roche corn;..titively. but “we are
committed to strengthening our
programs and activities to further
enhance the appropriate utiliration
of our products . . . We will

Kennedy, who said Valium and
Librium haVe produced "a
nightmare of dependence“ for many
people. also heard from Dr.
Theodore Clark, a Pinchurst. N.C.
psychiatrist who fought a personal
battle against “hard liquor and soft
drugs" for several years.

The North Carolina psychiatrist.
who is counseling at a drug and
alcohol abuse clinic. said he was a
"one-man testing station“ for the
free samples of drugs that often are
mailed to physicians. He said be
mostly took Librium.

“It got to the point where I
wouldn‘t see a patient until the
mailman showed up.“ he said.
“Where other doctors read their
mail. I was ealing mine."
