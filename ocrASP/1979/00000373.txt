it this summer. it ranked right up there with
tennis, the beach, and jogging. But this was
one pasttime nobody chose. it wasn't begun,
much lesscompleted with asmile. Whetherwe
were “lucky”enough to have our own car, or
had the "privilege" of using Dad's, the car

Oh, but the pricts we had to pay to be
mobile! In the first three weeksofthe vacation
season, the cost of gas in some neighborhoods
climbed from high in the 80¢ range to well
above $1.00 a gallon. Yet there's more to life
than those greenbacks. What about the price
of waking at 5:30 am. to be the 58th car on a
line —- a line leadingtoastation (you prayed it
led to the station. You couldn't tell because by
the time you arrived it had turned 16 corners,
climbed three hills, and was broken by two
lights) — that station whose proprietor had
madeclear he was first awaitinga delivery that
might not materialize until 11:00 at the
earliest. What do you do?

Do you go home and let the car sit for two
months without use? Do you wait and hope
the gas will arrive? Or waste the "precious"
fuel in the tank looking for a shorter line, or
guaranteed gas? The choicm. Most of us
waited on the line, passing the time by

The alternatives left us just a little less
baffled than the regulations for buying this
sacred item,

There were mornings l'd wake up, half
expecting to find a sign reading this way:
Pumping gas, odd plates only ~ lxgtween 8-9
ant, and 3-4 pm. to curs with less than liaI/u'

Then l'd look up and thank those stars

plates, a threequarters full lOgallon tank and and gave the morning radio Dds somethingto

system succeeded in cutting the lines in half. in spite of the new laws, the saying "rules

were made to be broken" was still hold true.

America's most unfavorable
pasttime -— Gas Lining. We
waited and steamed while
our cars thirsted, and
President Carter (with the
gas nozzle to his head)
sweated.

After all, what's a rule without an exception?

Drivers came up with new ideas every day to
“beat the system". Syphoning was a popular
method. Whether the gas was being stolen in
the heat of a deep dark summer night. or a
multicar family was simply transferring fuel
for their own purposes syphoning gas was as
popular as it 's dangerous. Most homemade
equipment required suction by mouth to start 
the flow of gasoline between tuba. Many‘
syphoners d‘sregard this danger, creating a
number of serious medical cases.

A kss dangerous method of beating the
system was switching license plates. Although
this seems like a practically foolproof method,
it bad one drawback. If for some obscure
reason your were stopped bya cop on the way
to or from a station with plates that didn't
match your registration the law was not on
your side. This left a hefty fine lacing you.

Many people would keep a supply of fuel in
their yards. Okay, this was a safe one if you
were absolutely 100% sure your property was
completely danger-free of fire. Even worse
than that were those who kept a few extra
gallons in their car. This insane kind of
ignorance is what hurt, and unfortunately
killed too many people this summer.

The endless lines proved to be newsworthy
at the least. While they were at their height of
popularity, the daily papers carried stories
everyday depicting the lines’ activities.

Brande-s the run-ofthemill people on line
with the wrong plates, those getting 78¢ worth
of gas, and the bizarre reasons forexemptions
 there were a lot more reports.

Do you rcnwn'ilx'r the one about the lady
who cut the line with an ailing puppy in the
back seat of her car? The other patrons

 

No gas in my car?
I’ll stay home today.
Can I walk that far?
Questions. Answers?
And more questions. And still no gas.

humanely gave her presidence on line. There
was a man at a Long island station who filled
the tank of a brand new Lincoln Continental
and drove away without paying. We read
reports of friendships growing and sometimes
an unexpected surge of commaradarie.

in Queens. a station owner's wife had her
legs injured when a car was inadvertently
thrust into reverse. She was sandwiched
between the two vehicles, and when her
husband rushed to her side. his patrons were
angered that they couldn't make their
purchases. Nonetheless, this didn't stop them.
That owner reported a great loss that day.

And then we read about the Brooklyn
station that unfortunately was the site of a
fatal shooting -— killing a man in his mid-
twenties, leaving his newly pregnant wife
«alone. This young widow is now suing the
'owner of the station on charges of negligence
She'll never forget the gas crunch of 1979.

Will any of us ever forget? Does a crisis like
this strike a country as large w as powerful
and as selfishly demanding as ours, and be
forgotten quickly? We wonder if the gasoline
prices will ever go down. if they do, will they
skyrocket again? We fret over how our
vacations will be next summer, existent at all,
or planned by calendars and laws again. The
thought of lines, endless lines filling our
streets returns to us. And we live in fear of
whether the day wrllcome that our tuelsupply
will eventually just be dry.
