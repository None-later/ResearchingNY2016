Networks Disagree On "‘The Cup”

By FREI) ROTHENBERG

AP Sports Writer

“Warning: The Surgeon General
Has Determined That Cigarette
Smoking Is Dangerous To Your
Health."

One television network also has
determined that calling a certain
horse race by its brand name could
be dangerous to its health.

For the past ﬁve years. CBS had
given the Marlboro Cup the young-
girl smoking-in-the-bathroom
treatment. Instead ofcallingthe race
by its given name. CBS called it
“The Cup" - except for announcer
lack Whitaker who slipped twice
last year and blasphcmCd
“Marlboro Cup."

The Federal Communications
Commission. which regulates the
broadcasting industry. took the
Marlboro Man and all the other
cigarette hawkers offthe air in I968.
The FCC felt television shoudn't be
the medium for launching another
generation of smokers.

CBS feels the horse race with the
cigarette name comes under the
FCC's restrictions. NBC feels
otherwise. and got its chance
Saturday because the New York
Racing Authority. NYRA. had
moved up the date of the Marlboro
Cup. That caused a conflict with the
CBS US. Open tennis coverage and
forced CBS to pass on its option to
televise the race.

CBS may have once considered
changing its policy on the Marlboro
Cup. but last September - after the
run-in with the FCC - was certainly
not the right time.

“CBS took an extraordinarily
conservative position which was not
founded. in our opinion. in law."
said Alan B. Kaufman. NBC‘s
director of Cotnplianccs and
Practices. "There have been no

reported cases in court or before the ’

FCC which would prohibit . the
mention of a cigarette company in
an established sports event.
"The Marlboro Cup has always
been the Marlboro Cup."
Kaufman says NIlC's general
policy is to control gratuitous

commercials. Even though it called ,I.

the Marlboro Cup by itsgivcn name.
NBC wanted to make certain that
Phillip Morris. the cigarette,
company sponsoring the race. didn‘t
get too much ofa free ride.The FCC
and NBC's paying customers
wouldn‘t like that. ‘

He told the producers to limit
visual references to Marlboro Cup
in the telecast. When NBC broke
away from the race buildup. the
visuals said coming up was “ more
thoroughbred racing“ orr“racingL

'l'rom Belmont."

And at a meeting before the race,
Kaufman asked the NYRA what
other exposure possibilities could
exist for Marlboro during the
broadcast. The NYRA'said a flag
with the Marlboro logo - which the
cameras wouldn't be able to sec-and
f tee plugs on the grooms'jackets and
the horses‘ saddle cloths. But the
NYRA said jackets and saddle
cloths wouldn't be needed if the
weather was cool.
