What Do You Want
From College?

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ it?

Add It To Your Schedule.

if any of this interests you
check out Army ROTC. And
even if you enroll for the
money, you’ll graduate with
something worth a lot more
. . . gold bars of an Army offi-
cer.

There’s nothing wrong with
allttle materialism.

We’ll admit it. One of the
selling features of Army
ROTC is lost plain cold cash

. . . nearly $2500 during your
junior and senior years of col-
lege. There’s also the oppor-
tunity for a full-tuition scholar-
ship. And a competitive salary
as an Army officer when you
graduate. ‘ w

' But we’ve got other good
things to offer you, too. Col-
lege courses which challenge
you both mentally and physi-
cally. Management training
and experience you'll find vai-
uable in civilian as well as in
military Jobs. And Instant lead-
ership responsibility in your
first Job after college.

7 “We heard in the middle of last
ar they were going to start
uilding the new stadium. but we
tdn't know where." Hurley said.
We didn‘t know it was going to be

Hurley said.

Syracuse Coach Frank Maloncy
laments the extra travel, but also
realizes what the Northeast's ﬁrst

program.

“Traveling can wear you down
after a while." Maloncy said. "It can

or three consecutive games on the
road. So you can image what it‘s like

A crowd of l5.000 to 20.000 is
expected.

Notre Dame Faces 
Michigan In First Game

by Will Grlrnsley -

AP Special Correspondent

When you sit down to a fancy
meal. normally you whet your
appetite with something delicate-
likc fresh shrimp or cold consomme-
and pick over a nice salad dripping
with French dressing.

Not Notre Dame. The Fighting
Irish. opening the college football
season. have chosen to leap right
into the beefsteak taking on
Michigan. Purdue and Michigan
State in that order. Then it's plop.
plop. fizz. fizz.

The Irish should chew their way
through the bone and gristle of their
first course. beating the Wovlerincs
in Saturday‘s TV feature. It gets
tougher after that.

Last week‘s tally: 30-l2. .7l4.
Taking a day out of the week‘s
vacation. here goes another spin:

Notre Dame 25. Michigan l7. The
Irish. with Rusty Lisch directing.

rebuilding power.

UCLA 27. Purdue 20. An upset.
