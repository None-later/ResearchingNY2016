Defeated By Oneontal

by Paul Schwartz

With freshmen in the top three
singles spots. the Albany State men's
tennis squad certainly was not long
on experience in yesterday's ﬁrst
match at Oneonta. Two of the three
managed victories in their singles.
but the Danes could not come up
with many more successes. and lost
to Oneonta, 6-3.

Albany‘s top player. Larry Linett,
was unable to attend the match, and
that left Barry Levine in the ﬁrst
singles slot. After showing
impressive talent in pre-season play.
Levine foltered in his ﬁrst collegiate
contest. and dropped a 6-2. 6-3

decision to Oneonta's Rich Korpf.
‘ “Karpf is a very hard server. and
-he was getting his first serve in.“said
Albany coach John Lieberman.
“Levine‘s serve was off, and that
caused him some problems. Barry
couldn't break him."

The Danes also had ﬁrst-year
performers at second and third
singles, and both come through with
wins for Albany. Lawrence Eiehen
defeated Steve Cohen. 7-6. 6-4. and
Fred Gaber followed his teammate's
lead and whipped the Dragon's Jay
Starr. 6-3. 6-3. "They both came
through for us." said Lieberman,
“but I expected them both to win."

Derrick Rubin had what
I Lieberman tabbed “an offday."and
was trounched by Dan Arnold. 6-4.
60. The only other Done to meet up
with success was Dave Lerner. who
at ﬁfth singles. edged Jay Fertig 7-6.
6-4.

Doubles was the Danes downfall.
Albany was swept in three straight.
and with the final two doubles
matches going to three sets, Albany
was frustratingly close to the vrctory
over the Dragons.

"Those two doubles matches were
extremely close." said Lieberman.
“We should have won both ofthem.
I think it wasthe lack ofplayingtime
with each other. since they were
together for the ﬁrst time."

Boaters Host English

by Mike Dunne

Now that all the pre-season
practices and scrimmages are
history, the Albany soccer team Is
ready to open their season

Sunday afternoon they will play
host to Southhampton University of
England in an International
exhibition match.

Based on past performances the
Danes should have a pleasant trip
north. They have defeated this
SUNYAC rival in each ofthcir last

nine meetings. including a 3-2

over last year. and was still confident

 

 

- Ann Meyers Dropped By Pacers

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) Ann
Meyers convinced Indiana Pacers
Coach Bobby Leonard she knew the
fundamentals of basketball well
enough to play in the National
Basketball Association. But.
Leonard said her size just wasn‘t
right.

"If she was six inches bigger and
40 pounds heavier, it would'have
been a different story." Leonard said
Wednesday after he told the 5-foot-
9. l40-pound Meyers that she had
failed in her bid to become the ﬁrst
woman to play in the NBA.

“I personally feel Ann did It great
job from the fundamental

standpoint of knowing the game of V

basketball.“ Leonard said. “I wish
'some guys out there tonight were as
fundamentally sound as her.“
Meyers. an All-American
women‘s player at UCLA and an
U.S. Olympic star in Montreal who
will remain with the club in some
capacity. took the news calmly.
“I'm happy with myself."she said.

“I did the best I could. The players
were super to me. Slick Leonard and
his assistants showed me tr lot of
things that I did wrong."

Sam Nassi, the club's owner who

decided to give Meyers her
opportunity. said no definite
decision had been reached
concerning a future role with the
team.

enough to state that. “we should be
able to beat them."
Southhampton, on the other hand
is a strong club and will provide
stiff competition. Schieffelin
analyzed their style of play, “They
play a good brand of aggressive
soccer. They hit a lot of long balls
and do a lot of running.“ The
Hooters who will be forced to play
on consecutive days will try and slow
down the tempo of the game.

The match will begin at 2 pm. on
Sunday. Schieffelin hopes for a
large turnout both to see the Danes
for the first time this season and to
witness a rare area appearance by a
European collegiate team.

The season opener for the Albany
State men's varsity cross country
team will take place tomorrow
against Coast Guard. The barriers
are the twentieth ranked Division III
team in the nation. and they have
made the NCAA‘s championship
meet nine out of IS years. Taking a
seven game winning streak in to this

season. Albany‘s chanCes of a

successful season are excellent.

The team will be led by Scott
James and Bruce Shapiro. Albany
cross country coach Bob Munscy
calls them the “dipper brigade."
Both sophomores. these two runners
hnie made it great deal of progress
in one year. and their improvement
could be due to a gamble by M unscy
lllill paid off. Starling them on the
varsity terrm Ignited the spark that
IlliltlL‘ last years \qlnrtl go 8—1.

llinghrurrton meet ut‘rr ycrrr ago. He
responded with it pressure 4:23 mile
in his Imrrrctimn. tIIltl liIlL'l' added it
liltII—plrrcc linish in the Nationals in
Illinois.

Shapiro cwcllcd in SUNYAC
competition. Ilc placed \ixlh witir :I
I:5R llilll-Ilillt‘. Hilttplltt's il\\L'l\ are

natural ‘sp’eedr‘errduronee and
toughness. In addition. he placed
ﬁrst in the Brian Quinn Memorial
run around Perimeter Road last
Friday.

The Danes will be hurt by the loss
of four oftheirtop ﬁve runners from
last years squad. Sean Riley
transferred to the University of
Pennsylvania. Ed Von Buren. John
Little and Mark Laven all
graduated.

This leaves the fourth-ranked
runner Jack Russo; and he‘s not a

Speedster. It's his determination that.

enables him to break out of the
middle of the pact to a roaring
finish.

Cross country fansask themselves
about Bill Mathis. lie had run a 4:l4
mile and at l:5(r ltalf—miie two years
Argo as it sophomore. Although
tctrm captain last year. he responded
with il subpar season.

this was due In it lack oftrrrining
on MIItIIis' part. lie run only 300
miles last summer compared to the
000 miles he run this summer.
Mathis is now in excellent shape.

_With Coast Guard 1

.are Mike Alfano. Matt Van Buren.
Kenny Carlstrom. Ismael Cruz. Bob
Johnson, Mike Sayers and Todd
Silva. Munsey says that all have
looked impressive. but Silva may be
the dark horse. Last year he was the
last man on the squad. Now that he‘s
a sophomore. he may surprise a lot
of people with his speed.

The barriers are at a disadvantage
due to the fact that the ﬁrst four
teams they face are tough. After
Coast Guard tomorrow. the Danes
have a triple meet against West
Point. Syracuse. and East
Stroudsburg at Army on Sept. 21.

Fifteen of 2'] junior varsity team
members are freshmen. Four of the
brightest prospects are John Cordi.
Nick Sullivan. Chris Lant.and Strve

The Danes lost to Coast Guard
