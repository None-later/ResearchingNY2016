out who we are a's a ballclub. and
what we can become." His long
range goal. and that of the team. is
to win the NCAA division III World
Series. Skeet insists that this is a
realistic goal. “I've seen the teams
there." he added. “and I know we
can be one of them.“

The Danes who have been
practicing once. snmetimcs twice
daily. have had fundamental
baseball drilled into them. The new
coach philosophiscs that no team
can be successful if they can't
perform the basics and perform
them well. Skecl has admittedly left
no stone unturned in this respect.

Skeel has only two question
marks on this squad. “(fan we
execute what we'Ve learned?" Skcel
wonders, “and is ottr pitching staff
deep enough to
schedule?“ Indeed. the Danes must
play l7 games in less than a month.

Conditioning will he a factor over
a schedule such as this. bttt Skecl is
not concerned or worried about the
physical ﬁtness ofhis team. “Ask the
players." Skcel said. "When we take
the field. there will be no opponent
in better shape than us." The old
line that baseball players are the
worst conditioned athletes evidently
does not apply at Albany State this
season.

Skcel maintains that losses dttc to

to face Hobart tomorrow. they will

[have one goal—to finally start off

the season right.

"For us. this is kind of a crucittl
game.“ said Albany State head
football coach Bob Ford. “We think

decent football team. and ttftcr
losing our first game the past few
years. we then made a run at the
playoffs this year, the opening game
is critical. It starts you off tip in the
ratings. and it sort ofsets the tempo
for the rest of the season."

The Dane‘s first game losses in
recent years came against powerful
teams. an excuse that will not hold
up tomorrow. Actually. Hobart is
ntore of a mystery than anything
else. The Albany coaches have not
scouted them. and basing an opinion
on last season's Statesman squad
would be frttitl .. . Hobart struggled

debacle.

An area where Hobart does have
quality and experience is at fullback.
Senior Ed Cooncy (6-1.2l5) has
amassed over 2000 yards in his
career. and is unquestionably the
Stutcsman‘s strongest offensive
weapon. “He‘s a great one.“
commented Albany defensive
coordinator .Iack Sicdlicki. “He‘s
definitely one of the best backs we'll
face this season. liven when they
haven't had good teams. (‘ooncy has
rttn well.“

A few years ago. Hobart set an
NCAA record fewest passes thrown
in a season- 12. A potent ground
attack has been a Statesman
tradition. and this year‘s squad is no
exception. Their gameplan calls for
('ooney to carry the ball over 20
titncs an outing. and if he is not
rushing. someone else will be.
Passing is simply not it major factor

Little is known about the Hobart
defensive team. except that only
three players are back from it year
ago. One of them. noseguard Brian

performer. The statesman set tip in a
4—4 defense. the saute type the Danes
use. and Whaylen is the key. “III: is

Mike Motta. Albany‘s offensive

Other returning veterans are

SUNY Fined $5000 In

Sex Discrimination Case

 

Legal Proceedings Continue

by Debby Smith

Sex discrimination was the charge
when New York State's Human
Rights Commission recently
ordered SUNY to pay $5000 in
damages to former SUNYA Pro-
lfessor Judith Leibowitz.

“It's the largest amount of corti-
pensatory damages given in the
history of the State Human Rights
Commission," said Division of
Human Rights Assistant Counsel
Robert Goodstein.

The decision. in part, ordered
SUNY to “cease and desist from
mistreating its employees because
of sex.”

While SUNY is currently appeal-
ing the ruling. Leibowitz remains

enmeshed in a complex series of ,
legal proceedings stemming from
incidents occurring during her ser-
vice on the faculty of SUNYA‘s
Comparative Literature Depart-
ment.

The subsequently-rctrenched
department was chaired by Joseph
Szovcrffy. who is named in-
dividually as defendant in at least
one of the Leibowitz cases.

This suit. Leibowilz v. Szoverffy.
was filed in New York State
Supreme Court and later dismissed.
Supreme Court Justice John Pen-
nock based his decision on plain-
tiff’s failure to state a cause of ac-
tion and the lack of “tryable issues
of fact." .

The case will be appealed by
Leibowitz within the next two
weeks. according to LCIbthll’l.
spokesman and former SUNYA
Politicttl Science Professor Clifford
Brown.

“There is a good chance on the
appeal.” said Brown.

But Leibowitr. presented her
grievances against Szovcrffy most
clearly iii the Human Rights Corti-
mission suit. in which SUNY was
held responsible for Szovcrffy's
allegedly discriminating acts. State
HUman Rights Commissioner
Werner H. Kramarsky concluded
that Szovcrffy:

I was antagonistic toward female
faculty members. that be harassed
and mocked such members.
threatened. and exhibited explosive
behavior toward them. other female
employees and students.

I humiliated. threatened, verbally
abused and physically manhandlcd
the complainant (Lcibowitz)

I used sexist remarks denigrating to
complainant and stated in conversa-
tions with her and others that corn-
plainant is “evil,” “dangerous.”

SA Setback $14,000

by Bob Illasertstein

Former Student Association (SA)
President Paul licldman overex-
tcnded last year's $70000 SA budget
by $14000.

According to SA Controller
Craig Weinstock. "someone who
used to be iit Tito's (Martinez) posi-
tion." apparently referring to
former SA Vice President l‘rcd
Brewingtou. deposited $14000
into the wrong account in the fall of
1978. Feldman spent the extra
money before the error was
discovered this summer by former
SA Controller Debblc Ruskin.

SA President Lisa Newmrtrk said
that a mistake “like this is very
rare" and that it is difficult to pin-
point who made the error.

Weinstock explained that the er-
ror was traced during the spring
semester bttt was not corrected by
the University Auxiliary Ser-

"All deposits that are made are
recorded and every expenditure is
approved. This time the error
wasn't caught." said Weinstock.
“Paul should have been aware.“

Newrnark explained cutbacks will
have to be made to tnakd up for the
loss of funds. “SA was ttscd to be-
itig rich. Now we‘ll just have to cttt
back. It‘s just not realistic to try
fundraising in this situation."

Weinstock said that steps have
already been taken to rcdttcc spen-
ding. such as the removal of three
telephones in the SA office. and a
redttction in xeroxing costs. There is
also a possibility that tltcrc will be a
raise in the Student Activity fee.

He added that he plans to chec
computer defects and “to use more
prudent controls over expen-
ditttres" in order to avoid a similar

wroblcm this year.

and "a threat."

“The facts as produced in this
case do not support a ﬁnding of
liability against the University."
said SUNY Counsel Sanford
Levine. “We feel the University is
not liable. even if the facts are
true."

Brown culled Levine's appeal
defective in that it was not filed in a
“timely fashion." In fact. he said. a
proper appeal was never filed at all.

According to Brown. the docu-
ntcnt filed by SUNY was ttterely an
“intent to appeal."

“It was sloppiness on the part of
' SUNY." he said. “The appeal will
probably not be dismissed."

“It's a case of great injustice."
said Sloverffy attorney Melvin L.
Woll‘. “We tried to get into it. so we
could win. and weren’t allowed to
intervene.”

Wolf added that he is “as smart
as he (Wolf) is because he was
brought up in Troy High School.
the best secondary school in the na-
tion."

Wolf feels confident that
Leibowitz' case directly against
Szoverffy will prove fruitless and a
waste of time and money. Szoverf-
fy, he said. feels vindicated of all
charges.

“He’s been carrying a heavy
bttrdcn of baseless allegation." said

Leihowitr' most recent legal ac-

in a further attempt to prove unfair

Lcibowitz includes teaching evalua-
tions. in which Sloverffy allegedly
falsiﬁed a statistical analysis.
