Jall Tale

A committee looking into charges
thatJohnSpcnkclink wasabuscd by
prison guards before his execution
has been told tltcy may never find
out ifthc charges are true because no
autopsy was performed on tlte
executed man.

Medical examiner Dr. George
Buyers. testifying before the
committee. said he decided not to
perform an autopsy on Spcnkelink.
despite a state law requiring
autopsies after executions. becav 2‘.
he claimed. it would have beer to
expensive. Iieycrs said the stt
would then have been obligated tU
perform an atttopsy on eaclt of the
134 inmates also awaiting execution
at the Florida State Prison at a total
cost of at least $500,000.

The committee also heard
testimony from Prison Super-
intendent David liricrton who cited
scettrily fears as his reason for
denying the condemned man visiting
privelegcs with his family. holy
communion. arid news interviews
before his death. Said liricrton. “I
was worried about someone
bringing something in to allow
(Spcnkclink) to kill himself. I
thought all the variables were
present for Mr. Spenkelink to take
his mm life." ‘

Muzak Attack

Muzak may actually hurt
worker‘s performance rather than
improve employee mantle. as the
makers claim.

William Steffan. head of the
Occupational Safety aml Health
Administration in California. says
that Murak may improve worker
productivity for a few months. but
after that. the piped-in music starts
to wear thin on employees.

Steffan says--in his own words--
“The stuff starts to get on a few
nerves...The human factor sets in
arid people begin to complain about
Mtl7itk.../\lltl performance level
starts to go down."

prison sentence following his
appearance on a Socialist Party-
sponsored pirate radio station.

The Socialist Party has publicly
supported the break-up of the
French government‘s monopoly on
local broadcasting. and plans to
make free radio an issue in the l9tll
presidential elections.

As part of its “free radio"
campaign. the Socialist Party put its
own pirate station “Radio Riposte"
on the air. and the station reportedly
immediately received wide support
from the French people.

However. heavily armed police
recently raided “Radio Ripostc's"
studio. using tear gas to sci/c their
transmitters and equipment. And
now. the French government has
decider! to prosecutcthose operating
the station. including Socialist Party
Leader Mitterand. for violating that
nation's strict broadcasting
regulations.

Mitterand and other “Radio
Riposte" staff members face
sentences of up to one year in prison
and a $2000 (dollar) fine.

communities in the United States.

The maga/inc says that the Arabs

program. to gain support from tltc
American Black community for

Pot Is Net!

California Attorney General
George “Duke” Dukmejian has
reportedly Iaunchcd an all-out
assault on crops of sinsemille. but
parts of a press release from the
"Duke‘s" office read like a chamber
of Commerce ad for pot. i

In the press release. the "Duke"
describes sinsemilla as “Those large
and extra-potent marijuana plants
being grown particularly in the
north coast section of California."

The Duke says he' himself made a
personal inspection of “A major
sinscmilla field“ and he noted that
the plants yeild “An inordinate
amount of T-H-C.“ the potent
chemical in marijuana. The Duke
went on to say that the sinscmilln
plants yeild “l0 times more than the
so-called premium marijuana
smuggled into the United States
from Mexico and South America."

The Duke says of the sinsmcilla.
"This is a particularly valuable crop.
Narcotics agents of the Division of
Law Enforcement with tltc
(California) Department of Justice
tell me tlutl the market value of
(‘alil'ornia-grown sinsemilla is $|000
to $|3IIII a pound. and nearly twice as
much on the liast Coast."

‘I he l)uke said that the plants gel
to be as big as nine to l2fcet.adding
“'l here‘s a tremendous profit to he
made from this potent California-
grown mariiuana.“ He noted.
honeycr. that it is illegal profit.

Goodbye Sister Disco

The future of disco music
continues to look shakey in light of
sortie recent developments last week
in the music business.

ltay (‘aviano. head of Warner
llrothcrs Rccords' Disco Music
Department. has announced he
intends to change tltc department's
name to "The Dance Music
Department.“

Caviano. who is considered to be
one of the most influential
prodyccrs in the disco world claims
the name change merer reﬂects
what he terms "The expanding
musical tastes of dancers" in this
country. In his words. "America
wants to dttnce to all forms of
music.“

One indication of the changing
natttrc of dance music. to which
('at‘iano rcfcrs. is the growing
popularity of new wave and rock
and roll dance clubs. Nightspots on
both lllt.‘ liast and West (‘oasts
“IIICII feature new wave music are
reported to be attracting large
crowds ot dancers who are tired of
the disco heat but still want to dance.

The Mac Attack

Recent reports that the new
Fleetwood Mac album "Tusk" cost
$500,000 to produce may not even
be close to the actual cost.

The L-P‘s Producer, Richard

I Bashct. told Billboard magazine

that the new album may be "One of
the most. if not the most expensive
album. ever produced."

Bashet hinted at a cost in excess of
$1 million which may be a reasonable
estimate. since the group spent nine
months in the studio at a reported
cost of 320.000 per week. That's
8720.000 for studio time alone.

Adding on the producers‘ and
technicians' salaries and
miscellaneous costs such as tape and
equipment. the estimate of SI
million appears to be a realistic
estimate of “Tusk's” production
costs.

More For Defense

President Carter: has asked
Congress to increase the Pentagon's
budget by close to $5 billion for the
fiscal year beginning on October
lst.

The President‘s request comes
after several U.S. Senators.
including Senator Sam Nunn of
Georgia. stated they would support
the SALT ll Treaty only if Carter
prontiscd to increase the Pentagon's
budget by five percent each year for
the next five years. The SALT
'l'rcaty is currently before the
Senate.

Carter has cited inllation as the
reason for his current request for
additional defense funds. The
increase would reportedly put
spending for the defense
department at three percent above

the current year. Carter has said he
will also seek an increase in defense
spending in I9Ill.

Carter‘s request for additional
defense funds Would place the
Pentagon budget for Witt) at $I27
billion.

“Out Door's” Tour

Led Zeppelin will not tour the
11.8. until May. I980. despite the
fact that the group currently has the
world's best-selling album on all
record charts.

The group's Manager l‘ctcr (irant
claims the band‘s I980 tour will
concentrtttc on playing music with
much less emphasis than before on
theatrical special effects. such as fog
machines and special lighting.

The band will reportedly perform
three hours of music at each concert
with no opening acts. The groupalso
hopes to keep ticket prices as low as
possible. with 5” being the
maximum ticket price for all Led
Zeppelin shows.
