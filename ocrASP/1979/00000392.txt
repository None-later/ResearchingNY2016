Netters Lose 6-] To Binghamton

by Kathy Perllll

Greeted by Hurricane Frederick
and an hour long wait to get into an
indoor tennis center. the Albany
State women‘s tennis team lost their
first match of the season Friday to
rival Binghamton. 6-l.

Last fall the Danes were defeated
by the Binghamton team by the
same result- — a score of 6-l.
However. Albany women‘s coach
Peggy Mann was optimistic. “We

beat them in the spring last yearand
we're gonna do it again this year."
she said.

in singles competition. top player
Lisa Dencrnark lost in three sets to
Heidc Heichemer. who she has
beaten three times previously.
Freshmen Elise Solomon and Aruy
l-‘cinbcrg. and transfer Lisa
McKigncy also lost their ﬁrst
matches. The only win of the day
went to Ann Newman with a 7-5. 7-5
triumph.

Michele Guss and Sue Bard lost in
doubles competition 4-6. 2-6.
followed by Sandra Borrellc and
Chris Rodgers who lost their first set
6-7. won their second. 6-2 and due to
a lack of time. played. and lost a
ticbreaker set. 5-3. “Today in
practice we‘re gonna practice
tiebreakers." said Mann.

The team‘s next match is
tomorrow. when the Albany nettcrs
host West Point.

Rose Closes In On Hit Record

(AP) This is going to be a tough two
weeks for Ty Cobb. sitting up there
in baseball's Valhalla. watching
intensely as Pete Rose slaps hits to
all fields and belly-whops his way
around the bases.

As the season wheels into its final
two weeks. the Philadelphia i’hillies
are wandering through the
wilderness of the National League
East. trying to avoid a depressing
fifth place ﬁnish. They have been
one giant-sired bust this season - r
all except the peppcrpot first
baseman who wearsJQo. 14 on his
uniform and keeps right on hustling

Yen may have missed it because
much of the l’hillies have done this
season has been eminently
miserable. bttt Pete Rose has
collected 186 hits so far. That is a
relevant number. because with l4
games to play. Mr, Rose needs l4
hits to reach 200 and salvage
something frorn this otherwise sorry
SCllSDII.

So what‘s the big deal about 200

' hits. you ask. Well. if Rose makes

the plateau, it will be the l()th time in
hiscareerthathe‘sdoncit.andthat's
where Ty Cobb comes in. Cobb.

with a world record 4.|9l hitsin his
fabulous career. packaged 200 in a
season nine times. Nobody — not
Honus Wagner. not Cap Anson.not
Willie Keeler -r ever did it 10 times.

With two weeks to go. Cobb and
Rose remained tied for the most 200-
hit seasons in a earcert9) and with l4
hits to go. Rose has a shot at his own
line iii the record book and you have
to know he‘d love that.

Cobb. though. probably wouldn‘t
mind. Rose is his kind of player ——
head first slide. never give an inch.
hustle all the time. The problem with
this season is that Rose is out of the
pennant race. an unpleasant and
strange situation for him.

in his years wilh Cincinnati. Pete
become accustomed to September
excitement. The Reds. remember.
have a proud history of autumn
achievement during the last decade.
When Rose walked away from
Cincinnati last winter. via the free
agent route. and Manager Sparky
Anderson was unceremoniously
dumped. it seemed the Big Red
Machine might have suffered
irreparable damage.
