minant Albany  Stops Hobart, 10-0

by Paul Schwartl
GENEVA — It was a game of ﬁrsts.
For the team. it marked the end ofa
three year ‘ opening game losing
streak. For the players. it was more
—— the first time any ofthem had ever
been l-0 in an Albany varsity
uniform. And for the defense. it was
the ultimate — a shutout. the first
since l976. 22 games ago.

Blended together. Saturday
turned out to be quite a pleasing day
for the Albany State football tetrm.

Shoen Enjoy Special Game

son openers go. there were more than the usual
prc-game butterflies for two Albany State players Saturday
afternoon. Sophomore Matt lirancato. a (i-l 205 lb. defensive end.
and junior Steve Shoen. a 6-] 2.10 lb. defensive tackle. thotiglt. had

lirancato was startitig for the first little in his college career. while
Shoen was making his return to the Danes‘ linerip alter a year away

The Statcsnicn's offensive ririit felt the hrtttit of the two players‘
nenoits energy. tis lirancato stood out with three quarterback sacks
and a fine performance overall. aitd Shoen had four tackles in

“i felt tnorc nervous this game than ever before." said llraneato.
“because you know how the other guys are expecting you to do your
part. I didn‘t want to let anyone down." it was llrtincalo‘s first-quarter
hit on llobart halfback (‘rrcg llein that caused llein to fumble the ball
away to the Daties. 'l'his eventually led to Dario Arango‘s 24-ya rd field
goal iriid Albany‘s first points of the season.

Defensive coordinator Jack Siedlceki is pleased with “f‘tllie‘llltl. "i
feel Malt potentially is one ofllic best football players We have iii oitr
program."Siedleeki said. “He's a big. strong kid and verycoaclia bie. l
had liintasa linebacker last year attd then we moved him to defensive
end and he just moved. He had no qualms about it. Antl now he‘s
starting ilc‘s doing a great job for as.“

' Shoen. who led Albany in tackles and Qll sticks two years ago.

couldn‘t \‘ait to get back in the trenches again. "I could hardly sleep
last night." Shoen said following the Ill-(i victory. "I was tip for the
preparer]. l was just very excited to be back playing football

Shoen made his presence immediately felt with a bear-brig tackle

Taking on a Hobart squad that was
limited in offensive capabilities but
pesky on defense. the Danes did not
overwhelm. but did come home with
a l0~0 victory over the Statesmen.
Defense was the story for the
Danes. With Hobart possessing a
strong inside running game but little
in the way of a passing attack. there
were few alternatives. so the
Statesmen tried repeatedly but
unsuccessfully to break through the
Albany middle. Hobart managed

and their leading rushcr. Ed
Cooney. was shutdown completely:
l3 carries for 31 yards. '

“There‘s no question. ifthey could
have thrown the ball it would have
been a different football game." said
Albany defensive coordinator Jack
Siedleeki. “Because everything We
did was to defeat the run.
Everything. And we really did ajob
on them. We came up with a lot of
big plays."

"They're like our offense." added
corirerback .loe Rajcrak. "When
they're in a throwing situation.
they‘d rather run. So that's the way
we had ottr game plan rigged for
the run mostly. Later on iii the game.
we knew they ltad to start coming
back and start throwing the ball."

Albany‘s passing game did not
exactly distinguish itself. either.
Dane quarterback 'l‘crry Walsh
threw only eigltt times. with three

Vcompletiotts. attd adding iii three

trick pass plays. the Albany offcitsc
compiled a less-than-robitst 53 yards
passing.

lint the Ditties could run the ball.
aritl they did. o\ct' and over again. it
wasn't the finely-timed wishbone
offensive of past games. and there
were no esploshc long gainers. biit
it was efl'ecti\ e enough for Albany to
monopoli/e possession of the brill
and run off 2| more plays than
Hobart. Walsh was the Danes‘ top
rusher with 91 yards. followed by
Levi Louis with 50 yards atid .laek
iiiirger with 43.

lioth Albaiiy scoring drives were
composed primarily of running
plays. bitl hotli also needed a crucial
pass cotnpletion to continue the

drive. After Daryl llayrior
recovered llobart running back
(ireg llein's fumble on the

Statesman 14 yard line. the Danes
immediately went for broke.
llallback ('hnek l’riore took a pitch
from Walsh. and then looked

This was the first of three surprise
plays attctnptcd by Albany in the
first half. with only one. an end-

“I fooled aroiiird too much in the
first half with a lot of different
things." said Albany lieiid coach

something that would ptit us iii the

trouble that way. What you‘re
looking for is shock value. You waitt
to sltoek them. and prove to them
that they don‘t belong on the satire
field as yotr do. We did somethings
we shouldn't have done. lit the
second half we entire back and tried
to establish a solid ground game."
After l’riore‘s pass fell

Late Goal Gives Boaters 2-1 Win Over Plattsburgh

by Mike Dunne

A not so funny thing happened on
the way to l’lattsburgh.

What should ltave been a slightly
bumpy biit very scertic drive through

the Adirondacks turned iritoa titaon -

headache for Albany State Soccer
(‘zrach Ilill Schietlclin and his
players.

A flat tire on the team's hits left
them stranded for a time.
Eventually they arrived in
l’lattsbttrgh in time to begin the
game at 3:30 p.m.. twoaritl one-half
hours after the scheduled l p.ni.
start.

The delay may have caused some
over—tirixiousnes‘s on the part of the
Danes. but nonetheless. they
managed to defeat the Cardinals. 2-

with it SUNY conference victory. It
was the filth straight year iti which
Albany has defeated l’lattsbnrglt iii
AUCCC“.

'l'he Danes took an early lead.
getting their first goal of the season
just l5 minutes into the match.

Matt l’arrclia caught l’latts-

kick. lie chipped the biili over the

defense to right wing Vasily Scrdsev.

first game for Albany. who brought
it under control and drilled it past
the goalkeeper.

"i felt good \\llL‘tl I got the ball.
and as soon as I kicked it I felt it was
going to go in." said Serdsev. "it
went just over liis(go;rlie‘s) head and
skimmed lltc top of tlic barns it \\etit
in." livct srriilittg and humble. he
added. "i guess I was just lucky.“

Unfortunately. Albany also
scored the game's next goal. it was
unfortunate because it counted ltri
l’lattshurglr.

Under ptessttte front the Cardinal
forwards. sweeper back Vliido
Sergovieh arid keeper Alberto
(iiordtino misunderstood each other
on how they were going to handle a
hack pass to Giordano.

"Alberto catne otit to receive the
brill." said Schieffelin. “anti he
hesitated just when Vlado kicked the
ball. Because he was off-balance the
ball rolled past him."’l'hat mistake

A play like that might litive dctited
the confidence of tilt inexperienced
defense like‘Albrrny's. especially if it
had cost them the game. iiowever.
instead of becoming rattled they
vindicated themselves by shutting
down the Plattsburgli attack for the

remainder of the game.

“After that goal they were really
aiming and hustling. biit we didn't
panic. We let tliciir cool off and tltcii
dominated." comrttetiteil l’ar‘r'clla.

Asbestos Raises Conce

J-LlJNYA‘s l’lant dcpartnietit aritl

of two downtown dorms.

NYl’lRG researcher lzric (ient

and requested that the trlcs he

l’lant Siipcrititcndant lia DeVoe
said that on his own request SUNY
Central personnel took samples
frotn various spots on etttttptts. but
he declined to reveal the location of
the areas under examination.

“Samples have been taken and

that last spring Ire

sent to the liib."said l)eVoe.”but we
are not yet sirre of what the contents
are." I)cVoe added that lie feels that
tit least some of the samples will
prove to contain an asbestos.

'l‘hc current investigation into the
health risk is only trite part of the
asbestos problem at SUNYA. Last
.laniiary. NYl’llUi Scientist Walter

on tiic Draper eorriples was one of
several public hitildirrgs front which
asbestos-contarniriated irir ‘rtttltples

Richardson's air sample came
lltlttl the basement boiler room,
where an aslnestos coating. once
sprayed on the ceiling as a fire
retardant. was flakingoll and falling
to the work area below.

While the State llealtlt
Department claimed at the titiie that
the threat posed by asbestos was
exaggerated. SllNYA‘s l'lant

intention to clean up Richardson's
asbestos within a year.
