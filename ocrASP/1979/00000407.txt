Boaters Mmhmdle Oswe'go State

by Jeff Sch-duff .

On a rather chilly. 50 degree
Wednesday afternoon. the Albany
State soccer team faced the Lakch
of Oswcgo State. representatives of
the SUNYAC Western Conference.
With a mere three returning starters
from a year ago. the Ltlkcrs were
nitlnhandled quite easily by a score
of 3-0.

This is nothing new. Under the
helm of Albany soccer Coach Bill
Schicffelin. “Albany has never lost
to Oswego." said the coach.

The game began. ten minutes
subsequent to the 3:30 starting time.
with rather ragged play. Albany
players looked tight. not iible to
connect on passes nor able to mount
an attack of some sort.

Five minutes into the contest. an
()swego attacker had his point-
hlllnk shot blocked by Albany
goalkeeper Alberto Giordano. who
came up with an excellent save.
'l his could have been the catalyst ili
engineering the start of an attack.
one that Oswcgo could not handle.

The only setback of the

questionable for the big Oneonta
game.

At|52l80fthe ﬁrsthalf.the Danes
connected on a goal when right-
wingcr and co—captain Rob Dahab
pushed the ball from the right
ﬂank to halfback Ali Kamara. who
then passed the ball on to center-
forward Afrim Neraj. who shot the
ball passed an already fallen Oswego
goalie. The Laker goalie dove for the
ball ili dcspilrtition as Kitmara
passed the ball to Nemj. thinking
Kalnara was going to attempt the
sllot on goal himself.

Time and time again Albany
succeeded in kcepillg the play in the
Oswego end. "Practice pays off. If
ball control improves. otir ganle
improves." sllid NL'IiJj.

Serdscv made all tlliitl/illg shot on
goal that nearly caught the right
corner of the goal. lllllfbiiek Alcx
I’tlgllno received a slick pilss from
Kamara. missing by just inches.

Drives like these were characteristic
of the Danes aggressive play all
afternoon.

"Our attack was solid and very
balanced. The offense was really
hustling and very aggressive."
commented Nezaj.

Pressure was deﬁnitely the name
ofthe game. Again. with I7230 left in

opportunity fall just. short when his
shot hit the Oswego keeper in the

hands. and hit the post.

()swego. for tile score could easily

'lhc second half began and the
Danes opened lip with some rather
sloppy play. Albany gave ()swcgo an
