. . . As Danes Look

by Paul Schwartz

lefore the season began. the two
biggest question marks for the
Albany State football team were the
offensive ‘ine and the defensive
JCCUIH‘ny. ’l'omorrow. wltetr tltc
' .ues travel to Southern
Connecticut. these two areas will be
severely tested. atrd their
performance coirld be critical to the
Albany effort.

In the Danes‘ opetiitrg game
.rictory last week. neither area felt
the brtint of llobart‘s attack.
Albany's offensive litre outweighed
the Statesmen's and the Dane
secondary did not have a chance to
prove itself against tltc non-passing
game of llubart.

This week will be differetrt.

Southern Connecticut is fond of
tlrrowitrg the ball. and not
surprisingly. it's tlte thing they do
best. 'l'hey utili/c a prossct offense.

coverages. We also must strip them
on first down. because if tltey get
into second-down~und-fivc
situations, they can either run or
throw. and that's tough."

Against AlC. the Owl’s were
simply overmatehed. Southern
Connecticut is an impressive

stifle the Owl running game. atrd

There is no more waiting. The first
big "test" of the season is tonight. A
victory will not only go it long way
towards deciding who the SUNY
Athletic Conference Champion will
be. but also give full bragging rights
for the next I2 months.

The "test" for the Albany soccer
team will be a high spirited match
against the nationally ranked and
undefeated Division I Oneonta Red
Dragons at 7:30 p.m. tonight in
lllcekcr Stadium.

Last season. the Danes invaded
Oneonta at a time when the hosts
were ranked as the number—one
soccer team iii the state. Albany
came away with a hard fought l - 0
triumph. a loss which sent the
Dragons into a tailspin tltat saw
them fittisli at it - f) - 2 and without a
spot in the NCAA playoffs.

Do not be deceived. however.
because ()neortttr is very much a
team to be feared. 'l'ltcy itiarraged to

noted Drinc dcfenseman Vlado
Sergovich.

With three starting players out of
tonight's match with injuries. and
still two more regulars listed as
"doubtful" by Oneonta Coach
Garth Siam. the team stands as
somewhat of a mystery.

The worst injurv toll was taken in

“Our defense ltas bccn doing a

reason is the play of fullbacks Alex

proclaimed Slam.

Despite their unusual attacking
methods. the Dragons have
managed only three goals thus far.
including a tncagcr one goal effort
against Potsdam, who isa percnially
weak SUNYAC team. This iact
makes it easier to understand Stam's
statement that. “We lutvc no
dangerous players tip front." look
for Chris Moore and John Cato to
rrruster tnost of the scoring chances.

Overall. Slam is expecting a light
from the Danes: We always have a
good contest with Albany. llie
games have been very good the last
few years and I expect the same."

"test". they nectl only look as Iar'

The defensive litre averages over
