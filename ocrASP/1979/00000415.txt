“We played good containment
defense. noted Siedtccki. Against a
team like this you must prevent the
big play and keep them in poor field
position. You‘ll get the breaks ifthen
continue to pass."

freshman punter Dave Hardy who
continually pinned Southern inside

middle of the ﬁeld. Neither side
could manage to mount an attack as
passes died in the puddles and
players took pratfalls in the greasy
mud.

This loss was especially bitter for
the Danes because they believe the
outcome would have been different
on a dry field. "On a dry field we
wouldshave won." proclaimed Vlado
Scrgovich. who suffered a
hyperextension of his knee in the
second half. ‘

“The whole game was even. but
because of the field neither team

game tonight as a 0-0 tie. I think we
could beat them." said Giordano.

The victory was certainly not an
artistic success. yet the fact remains
that the Dane defense is unscored
upon in two road games.

The major Albany problem seems
to remain in the inexperienced
offensive line. a point which Ford
acknowledges: “We weren‘t pleased
with our offense. We‘re still not

consistent."

“I'm very disappointed but the
players haw nothing to be ashamed
of. It wasn‘t a test of skill." said
Schieffelin. “The quality of the field
was most disturbing. It would have
been an entirely different game on a
dry ﬁeld."

The Rooters record now stands at
2-1 with all the games having been
SUNYAC matches. Another very
tough SUNYAC foe, Cortland, who
defeated Albany in the NCAA
tournament last season awaits them
this Saturday.

"I hope we can pttt this gttme
behind us. We have a lot of games
remaining and not many teams go
undefeated.“ giddcd Schieffclin.
