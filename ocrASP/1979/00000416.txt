Hudsbn Valley Defeats
Dane J.V. Gridders, 16-6

by Bob Ilelluflore

Friday night. in muddy and
"unbelievable" field conditions. the
Albany State J.V. football team lost
their season opener to rival Hudson
Valley Community College. [ti-ti. at
the Vikings' home field.

Dane fullback Sam llrowu scored
the lone Albany touchdown on a
four-yard rtln. The conversion was
missed. State lreslunen quarterback
Tom l’ratt was rtarned offensive
MVl’ by the Hudson Valley Booster
Club.

"We did well.“ said J.V. t'oothull
head coach Tom Mayer. “against a
really excellent team who‘s done a
lot of recruiting." The coach cited
sophomore linebacker Greg DiNotu
and defensive ends Tout Pinto and
Tim Price for outstanding defensive
play. but added that the entire
defensive unit had a good game.

Hudson Valley opened the

scoring with a field goal. but the
Danes cotmtered with the run by
llrowu. It remained 6-3 with Albany
ahead until the fourth quarter. when
the Vikings scored the decisive
touchdown on a long rtrn from
scrimmage. The Valley sealed the
game with three scconds left on a
short pass which followed all
unsuccessful Dane attempt at
converting a fourth and five
situation deep in their ownterritory.

Mayer pointed out the secondary
as being an improvement over last
years. The Jnyvees lost to the
Vikings in I978 on two long scoring
passes. There were none Friday. Jeff
Whitson had art interception for the
Duties.

The season continues on Friday
for the J.V. as lthaca College
invades in a 3:00 pm. contest at
University Field.

.BANY

5W1?!

 

by Maureen George

After opening the season last
weekend witlra clean swap of the
Coast Guard Academy. the Albany
State men's cross country team
found the going a bit rough this
weekend. as they traveled to West
Point to participate in a tri-mcet.
The varsity squad was beaten by all
three opponents but the scores
should not overshadow the effort
and the line performance of the
Albany squad.

The most influential factor of the
day was the weather. which
consisted of heavy downpours and
driving rains which never let up.
“We never run at Army when it
hasn't been a driving rainstorm.“
said Albany cross country coach
Hob Munsey. who expressed
satisfaction in the performance of
his squad. "Our times were fantastic
for the conditions. We got laced as

 

The Albany State junior varsity football
by Hudson Valley last

expected but we really ran well."

Because of the rain. the results
were waterlogged. The IBM
printouts were soaked. not even
legible. prohibiting Mun5cy to
reﬂect on some of the times.

The scoring was as follows: Army
beat Albany 20-43. East
Stroudsbourg downed Albany 20-
37. and Syracuse trounced the
Danes. l9-44. The overall winner.
Berrier. from East Stroudsbourg.
clocked in with a time of25 minutes.
7 seconds. Bill Mathis was Albany's
first runner and he came in second
with a time of 25 minutes. 27
seconds. the fastest time for any
Albany runner on the West Point
course, it was also the first time a
runner from Albany ﬁnished ahead
of an Army member. Army‘s
Grogan finished third followed by
O‘Connell from Syracuse. Times
were unavailable due to the

waterlogged results.

Munsey was extremely pleased
with the performance of Mathis,
praising him highly. “Mathis ran
very well and put forth a truly great
effort." Munscy said. “I have to
think way back to try and remember
an effort as great as Bill Mathis put
out."

The Albany junior varsity squad
was beaten by Army. lost to East
Stroudsbourg by one. and beat
Dutchcss Community College. in
their meet. the ﬁrst Albany runner.
lsmacl Cruz. came in second. Cruz
came through with It finc

performance and may run‘

sometimes for the varsity squad.
The meet left the Danes varsity
record at l-3. Tomorrow they will
travel to New York to face Wagner
College. New York Tech and
possibly other schools. The meet will
take place at Van Cortland Park.

College’s Big Three Win Big

(Al’) Southern California potired it
on in the first half. Alabama rolled it
tip in the second half. and Oklahoma
split things pretty much down the
middle. But no matter how you slice
it. college football's three top-
rankcd teams had matters firmly
under control Saturday.

The same could not be said for the
rest of The Associated Press Top
Twenty. Notre Dame. Penn State.
and Pittsburgh were losers while
'l‘exas. Nebraska. Michigan State.
Missouri. and Washington had to
rally for second-half victories.

There likely will be no changes at
the top of this week‘s ratings. Top-
ranked Southern Cal surged to a 35-
0 haiftirne lead as All-American
Charles White rushed for IS] yards
and two touchdowns and plastered
Minnesota 4844.

Meanwhile. runnerup Alabama
broke open a relatively close game
with four touchdowns in the final
period and flattened Baylor 45—0
while third—ranked Oklahoma
scored 2| points in the opening
period. 2| more in the final one and
crushed Tulsa 49-13.
