As you may or may not know.
puny State has a new baseball
ach. His name is Rich Skecl. and
‘s from the midwest—«Ohio to he
act. Skeel had previously been
ad baseball coach and assistant
sketball coach at Heidelberg. a
all college in tllc Ollin Athletic
nferencc. Why the move'.’ Well.
‘eel sees a big future for Albany.
wants to make Albany :1
werhousc and sees no reason why
can‘t.

“Albany State is a big school
' ing Division III baseball.“Skecl
ld in an Interview Monday. “And I
I if I can recruit at a small college
d make them a winner. that with
ysical attractives and academics.
crc's no reason why we can‘t he a
wer in Division III.

Skeel was first exposed to tile
NY system last year when
leelberg was playing in a
kethall tournament at Genesco.
liked their program over there for
mail enrollment." Skecl said.
d that‘s wltat got me interest in
Y e SUNY system," Fcclinga hit
s ‘ by tlle small si/c of
 Heidelberg. Skccl looked for ll
5 change. "I looked at Heidelberg asa
‘ springboard action and was looking
for a bigger school to goto.“he said.
“When I found otlt abotlt the
V coaChing job at Albany. l thotlght if
Albany was anything like (ienesco. I
would definitely be interested.

As it turned out. Skeel was very
impressed with Albany and decided
0 take tlle job. “I sawlor lllyselfaltd
my faulin an excellent opportunity.
a place where I could stay. and
really. I had done everything [could
do at lligll school andcollcgc. taking
programs and building winners otlt
of them."

i In assuming the Albany head
coaching job. Skecl replaced Ilob
Burlingame. who retired at the end
of last year after 20 years ofcoaching
at Albany. Skeel finds replacing the
establlsllcd lttll'llngame most
challenging: “Had the previous
coach been a younger person being
, dismissed. then I‘d be more
concerned abollt inherent problenls.
Anyone who puts 20 years into ttn
. athletic program has done a
fantastic job~you don‘t even
question it. The fact that he won 200
»' ball games tells that he knew what he
1 was doing. I consider it a sincere
'. privilege to replace him as a coach
' and let‘s hope I‘m allowed as nluch
'. tinle to get my act together.“

Skcel is a young. enthusiastic
coach ill his 30‘s. He is ltard
.Eorking. dedicated. and very

disciplined. seeing hinlself as a
todel for his players. “I don‘t think

 

a coach should go around smoking
cigarettes and getting encbriatcd
night after night." says Skeet. "Andl
tltink the coach should stay in good
shape and set an example for the
players. I tllink these fellows have a
positive. enthusiastic outlook all the
time and witll everybody I‘ve met
here. I just fall rigllt in line and look
life anotltcr duck in the road. cause
that's the way everybody is' here."

you're trying to hate a successful

There will be no star system on the
squad. A star system lets his players

fundamentally sound hllllchlh that
plays with intelligence. 'l’o instill this
in his players, Skecl has been an
educator and has been working the
players hard ill practice. “What I can
honestly say about these guys."said
Skeel. “is that everybody is putting
otlt l()() percent. Skcel believes that
the tcanl belongs to tllc players. “I

down. "You'll never hear lllc nlakc a

llavc some good people that I really
tllink are doing a grcatioband that I
don't think I can do without. htlt I'll
never let them know anymore than.
‘Iley. you‘re doing a fillc job."

Can’t Be A Powerl:

less than one game from making the
NCAA playoffs with his Heidelberg
team last year. which played in one
of the toughest Division III
conferences in the nation. “I believe
in winning.“ says Skeet. “because
that‘s what‘s going to happen to you
when you get out in life.“ Skecl.
hocvcr. doesn‘t believe in winning at
all costs. "I really care about
athlete_s."_ “I want them to get a

diploma and if they do have tlu.
ability for a major leagtlc career. 1

think I can help them.

“With‘ Albany. you hach
education alld athletics. not athletics

and education. You have to have
some fun in the game. You can run
these guys ill the ground or you can

do it systematically and conditional

to the pmnt wllere they re

p to take this program and try and

v playoff. "how that I'm here. I like it

Also in for a change will be the
recruitment program. “Recruitini
will be done very systematically and
very heavily all year.“ claims Skccl,
who feels that Albany's selling I
points include financial aid;
attraction of a good education. and
-a chance to be exposed to a good
baseball program.

But this year. Skcel will work with

a team that he took no part in
t tilding. “I‘m in here without a
single recruit.“ said Skcel. “not one
recruit. I'm in lterc with what‘s here.
I probably have the biggest
challenge I‘ve ever faced. and that‘s

make a winner out of them. and the
mark is on me. I little losing and it‘s
going to be a verydifflcult season for
me because I may take some lumps
this year. bllt it won't take more
tltall a year or two. because any
lumps i take this year. those will be
the first people I get back."

Skccl sees a gold mine at Albany
State. He wants his team to be big
time. tasting the fruits ol success.
."ll‘tL‘ only diffclcnee betw:en
Albany and a Division I school is the
amount of money pumped itlto otlr
program." said Skeel. “()ut‘ coaches
are working as hard here as they are
at Ohio State . Michigan. UCLA or
Southern (‘.'tlil‘orllia. The only
difference is the amount of money
anti alumni support. [see no reason
why it school out sire involved in a
Division III conference can‘t pllt otll
a consistent \viuncl."

Skecl's goals are first. to have a
winning season. then to get at Ii(‘A(.‘
bid. will the SllNYAC. nlovc up in
the division and make the NCAA

 

very mucll atld I plan on staying till
we prove something not only
statewide in New York. htlt also so
people could say“llcy. they can play
baseball ill the llottheast as well as
they can in the midwrst and south “

Skecl added. “We have to go out
and heal people and get otlrseltes
known and have it spread arouuu.
and hopefully somebody will think
enough ol'us to say‘hcythesc people
can be exciting to ptlt ill our
tollrnamcnt.‘

“II we ever get a shot at the
tourualllcut (NCAA). we might filld
ourselves in the final lour. and
winning would be as meaningful as
just being there in the final four. If
that ever happens. I know about
25 players. who I'll have at that time
who will all have an experience that
they'll never forget. and nlaybe then
I could start saying I did what I was
supposed to be doing; when I gave
back what was given to me in
sports.“
