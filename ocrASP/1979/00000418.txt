Lightning-

by Mike Dunne

NEW HAVEN - Lightning struck
three times at Bowen Field last
Saturdav. The bolts. coming in the
form of unusually long Albany

touchdowns. led the. Danes to a
20-0 victory over the stubborn Owls
of Southern Connecticut.

The often unheralded special
teams provided most" of the
excitement for Albany. They
accounted for two touchdowns and
also blocked a pair of kicks.
enabling Dane head football Coach
Bob Ford‘s squad to overcome
another lackluster offensive
performance.

The three big plays were as sudden
as they were exciting. First. there
was Don Bowen‘s 73 yard punt
return. then halfback Jack Burger's
)4 yard kickoff return. and ﬁnally.
Don Hyde's interception and 86

Rain And

by Mike Dunne

One look at the Bleeker Stadium
playing field Friday evening made it
apparent there would be more
splashing and sliding then passing
and trapping during Albany's long
awaited soccer match with ()neonia
State.

Four hours of steady rain prior to
the 72.10 kick-off produced an
enormous puddle stretching
between the penalty areas. The field
was a quagmire with the water
ankle-deep .in several spots.

Regretably. the conditions
reduced a game that surely would
have been excititrg and skillful to
one in which a single goal would be
enough.

Unfortunately for the Dane
hooters, Oneonta got that goal first.
It came early on with in minutes

Red Dragon midﬁelder Oscar
f’arriga sent a corner kick along the
eudline to winger Mike Cato, who
was being marked closely by
Albany's Ali Kamara. As Cato
turned towards the goal both he and
Kamara went to the ground. Much
to the disagreement of the Albany
players anti fans. the referee called a
foul on Kamara and awarded

Photo Equipment Stolen

by Aron Smith

Photography equipment valued
at $900 was stolen from a SUNYA
student Monday in a broad daylight
mugging on the podium.

According to SUNYA Depart-
ment of Public Safety officers, an
Olympus camera with telephoto lens
and accessories was grtibbed from
University Photo Service stttff
photographer Stcve Essen about
5:30 P.M. in front ofthc University
Library.

.According to police reports. the
assailant approached from the rear
as Essen photographed a subject for
Torch '80. Essen pursued his
assailant and twice overtook hint. a
scufﬂe ensuing each titne.

The subject of Esscn's photograph
turned out to bean accomplice iii the
larceny, as he violently kicked the
victim while his other attacker held
him on the ground.

Essen reported lifting one of his
assailants during the melee.

shirt. tan or gray knit pants. Dark dress shoes.

throwing him head first into the
Education Building.

According to one SUNYA police
officer. Essen also'caused the head
of one of his assailants to collide
violently with a pillar.

“There were huttdreds of people
milling around who saw it happen."
said the ofﬁcer. “it's an out-and-out
mugging. rigiit iii the daylight. We're
kind of anuwcd ourselves. it‘s not a
common thing on campus."

Since Es u had taken a snapshot
of his subject. a photographic record
of uric of his attackers did exist.
According to Essen. however. the
photo was destroyed in the
developing process when it was
accidentally exposed to light.

The incident has caused turttiy
sttrdcrtts to be increasingly wary of
carrying valuables on campus.

“l‘ll still carry my camera." said
University Photo Service staff
photographer Suna Steinkamp.
“But not when l'ni alone. l'm going
to be a lot more nervous."

In their search ftrr suspects in the
case. SUNYA Police have compiled
composite drawings of the two
assailants. One is described as a

Student Legal Aid No Longer Free

 

SA Cities High Cost of Service

by Michael P. Fried

Student Association legal services
will no longer be offered free of
charge to SUNYA students. Citing
rising costs coupled with a rapidly
expanding program as the primary
reasons for thc nrove. SA ('ontrollcr
Craig Wcirrstock announced that
students represented in court by SA-
employed lawyers will be required to
pay a twenty dollar fee for the
service.

SA Legal Services is presently
operating under a $25.000 birdget
with art ittcorne line of only $6.000.
The difference is nradc up with
student tax money through Central
Council allocation.

“We're already subsidiliug the
program “9.440.” said Weinstock.
“It was the decision of the liitdget
Committee that any more subsidies
would hurt other student groups
because if we suhsidiIed this more.
we'd have to ctit money to the
student groups."

SA Legal Services attorricy .laek
Lester detried "personally having
anything todo with institirtingitttlrc
fee)."

Lester arid Lou ()liver. another
Legal Services attorney. both serve
on SA retainers.

Last year Lester tnade about 150
appearances in police and justice
courts iii Albany. Guildcrlarrd.
Colonic. Niskayuna. Troy. arttl
Cliftotr Park. He explained that the
fee is necessary “because it took a lot
of time and resources to make those
court appearances.“

“Last year there was no ineotne

_ for the group." said Weitistoek.
“This year. in order to provide legal
services, we had to charge the twenty
dollars."

Students who cannot afford the
court appearance fee may apply for
a waiver ‘of the fee. according to SA
Legal Services Director Ron Hock.

Hock said that the Legal Services
Committee will review each

application individually. making
waiver decisions on the basis of
nccd.

A recent Legal Services
advertisement printed iii the Albany
.s‘ltrrlcnl PI'I'AA'. iritctrdcd to inform
students of the new fee, was headed
by the words "Attention Crooks!!!“
iii bold type. The advertisement was
apparently ineffective. as many
students have not been aware of the
court appearance fee.

"It was a quick ad." said Hock. “I
didn't lutve time to come up with a
good one."

Many students claim they will
seek legal services elsewhere. such as
through the state-funded Legal Aid
Society of Albany County orthe city
public dcfcnder's office.

“My opinion would have to do
with how students feel about the
fee." said Lester. "if students are
against it, l'm against it. l‘m for free
legal service. so it goes against my
grain."

Within these early stages of
production. five Central Council
members resigned. presenting a
questionable image of the student
government. What problems do
these resignations pose’.’ ls Council a

council members who will not
