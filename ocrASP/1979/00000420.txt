Personal Reasons the Cause
of Council Resignations

cominut-dfrom page one '
procedure against each other. “It got
me pissed off." One member was
subjected to possible censorship.
"People were fed up with that
night.“

Cohen resigned because of an
overload ofseboolwork and difﬁcult
courses. Once again. a concern with
doing a propcrjob becomes the basis
of a resignation. She adds that
resignations took place soon after
the September l2 episode.

Chair of Academic Affairs Lloyd
Iiiship. “an invaluable member to
Council". says Central Council
Chair Mike Levy. resigns. When he
ran for the position last year. he
never cortsidered that he would grow
tired of student government. “There
was a realilation that I wanted to be
a senior."

ery weren't these possibilities
considered before election time last
year? According to Central Council
member Gary Schutsky. people
desire a council position for three
basic reasons: I) They want to make
a change on campus. 2) They want to
put something on their resume. 3)
They want to fill up time slots. Now
must we wonder which members
fulﬁll which category?

“People who aren't working on
cotrrrcil should riot be on council.
There are people who shouldn‘t be
there now." explains Schutsky. Will
Levy ask these people to resign?

Bishop said these resignations at
such an early date are “out of the

 

  

SEPTEMBER 28, I979

ordinary. The council is in a state of
flux." There are many new
members: inexperience seems to be

.taking its toll. “It will take a while

for things to settle down.“

Bishop explains that many of the
new members are not used to
discipline: they don't know how to
conduct themselves. Although he is
optimistic. and claims the last two
meetings have been without the
essence of a "zoo". he admits this
present council needs “a little more
time" to organirc itself.

Which leaves the average student
questioning the strength of the
council. lnexpcricncc in abundance
tends to diminish a sense of trust
within the student body. How cart
this problem be rectified? On
October 8. elections will be held to
initiate new members and replace
those who have resigned. (‘an we be
assured of a more experienced lot'.’

Levy is optimistic: he is pleased
that those who resigned did so at an
early date. They were aware oftheir
limitations. The image ofcouncil. Ire
adds. will be projected by its
accomplishments rather than the
resignations. Ilut he openly admits
that there are others who should be
saying they can‘t do the job.

Before the upcoming elections.
Levy will meet with the candidates
to inform lhcrn of their duties as
council representatives. Members
will be prepared for their
rcsponsihilites. Perhaps this is a step
in the right direction.

But the question remains. Will
Central Council ﬁnally become a
uniﬁed group? ‘

Bishop said that last year. council
was more experienced. “There were

never problems to this degree under,
Dave (Ruffo)." He adds that Levy is
an effective leader but that hecarrics
a “soft gavel. He‘s more low key than
Dave.“

However. despite persistent
questions by several reporters. they
declined to discuss what “symbolic

him understand American youth.

"We have said they are going to he
