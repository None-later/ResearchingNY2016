The program was initiated in the

None at the Above

One of the candidates in next
month's elections for governor in
Louisiana has legally changed his
name to“none ofthe above.“And he
wants it listed that way on the ballot.

The candidate. whose name used
to be Luther Devine Knox. has
petitioned state election ofﬁcials to
print his new name. not his old
one. on the October 27th baliot.

Knox claims that the voters have.

At last report. the state of
Louisiana was refusing to go along
with none of the above‘s request.

Wasp Munch

A new type of wasp that prefers
junk food to plant nectar and pollen
has reportedly invaded the United
States in recent years.

New York's department of
environmental conservation reports
that the so-called “picnic wasp" -- a
type of ycllowjacket with a mean
sting -- was unknown in America
until the early l970‘s.

However. that one-time ' rare
species from Europe is reported to
have taken over picnic grounds
across America. insect experts say
that the new wasp erijoysirnd thrives
on the some food we likeat picnics--
mct‘ything l'rorn beer and soda pop
to hot dogs and hamburgers. The
invaders reportedly have been
stinging their \ictims on the tongue
or in the mouth.

Daft Draft

It has long been \tlltI that one way
to cut tIU\\Il on the number of wars
would he to draft the middle-aged
and older people In society who own
most ot the property and iniIucncc
most of the decisions -- instead of lil-
year-olds.

 

Now. a new~study from the
Brookings institution concludes
thatdraftingpeopieintheir30's,40's
and even 50‘s is probably a good
idea.

The Brookings‘ study is titled
" Youth or Experience? Manning the
Modern MIII'rary. 'It says that the

The study notes that. instead.
humans operate machines that ﬁght
each other. and the machines require
vast bureaucratic back-up services

capably. cotrld be handled by St)-
ycnr-olds with years of experience.

Despite the report. there have
been no calls in (‘otrgrcss for the

than of Ill-ycnr-olds.

Who’s There

Fans of pop music may soon bc
able to watch their |rr\ot'ilc groups
as they listen to their records.

the British group. 'lht' Who. him.-

in the use of holograms. According

The picture apparently hovers

the real thing, except it is only five
inches tall. Nick Phillips. a director
of The Who’s Company. is quoted as
saying he believes the idea could be
extended to run 3-D color film off
the recordings.

Heavy TV

Three of the most popular
situation comedies on TV this fall
are reportedly going to deal with
“heavier” issucs. '

The New York Post says that TV
producers have decided to make
several of the shows more “issue-
orriented“ and "more mature“ by
working in several not-so-funny
sub-plots.

For example. in the show
“Laverne rind Shirley." Shirley will
discover she is a diabetic. her
brother will battle alcoholism and
her father will develop (iluucoma.

Over at “Mork and Mindy."
Mork will be forced to deal with the
subject of'cutbtrnasia. “A robot tries
to die with dignity." is the way the
producers ptrt it.
