The Editor’s Aspect

A 'l'ime’For
thanse

“The music must change,” rocked The Who last week,
and so must we. Change and growth are the only
constants we have... Growth, because the absence of it
is as good a definition of death as you’ll find. And change
because a rolling stone gathers no moss. To constrain
ourselves, to wrap ourselves in the stifling drapery of
convention and tradition is to rob ourselves of
excitement and adventure. Change is strange. it leads to
the unknown, which is terrifying like a good horror
movie, amazing and riveting.

When we force ourselves into routine, when we say
we’ll accept what We have because we’re used to it, and
when we are to bound by consistency to risk it all “on one
game of pitch and toss," then we’ve abdicated the only
realm we’ll ever have any claim to: imagination.

We’ve changed, not too much though. it’s still
Aspects, but we’ve added new sections, building on the
good thing Aspects has always been, we hope. It's a little
bigger, twelve pages now, instead of eight. And in the
coming weeks we’ll be experimenting with stylistic and
format changes.

The Student Notebooks, our page of columns, may
jostle some thoughts and feelings. They’ll prove
interesting to mull over between classes or on the bus.
We've also added a fiction and poetry page, for your
reading pleasure, and to stimulate the old imagination.
We welcome contributors. And there are a few other
surprises.

ln this issue we took a look at student activism, both in
theory and in practise. A quarter of a million people
gathered at Battery Park last week. Rock stars and
media stars sang and spoke to the enthusiastic (and
slightly inebriated) crowd. The topic was nuclear energy,
though at times it looked and felt more like a gigantic
festival. The event was saved from becoming a circus
because of the dedication of the demonstrators to this
Cause of the Seventies. (But a splendid time was had by
all).

That's basically it. Take it home and enjoy. And don't
fade away, drop us a line.

Spiritual Graffiti

“This is the true joy in life, the being used for a
purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the
being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on
the scrap heap; the being a force of nature instead of
a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances
complaining that the world will not devote itself to
making you happy. "
—— G. Bernard Shaw
