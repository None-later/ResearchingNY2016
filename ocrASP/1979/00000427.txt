A bearded, heavy-set man walked -
unsteadily in my direction. He was ﬂanked on
either side by two smaller men in shabby suits
carrying beer bottles. They were obviously
dran and mumbled among themselves in a
foreign language. i knew this crew was going
‘to be trouble. 1 did my best to slip away, but it
was too late. Our eyes had made contact and
the heavy-set man stared at me with a stern.
demanding expression. Nothing needed to be
said. it was one am. and l was tired and
sweaty. i felt like turning and running in the
other direction but i had no choice. Defeated,
l walked hesitantly over to the men.

“Dinner or just cocktails?", i asked.

“Oh, no. we just rest".

1 barely understood him through the thick
accent.

“Sorry, there's a $9 minimum at these
tables." i breathed a sigh of relief. Foreigners
jare the worst tippers.

Disco music blasted through the sound
system constantly. There was no escaping it.
Wall to wall people of every shape, color. and
size; drinking, dancing. dropping; coming off,
getting off, and coming on.

l turned and headed for the kitchen
through the ever-present cloud of cigarette
smoke. it was the only place where the sound
of the music was muffled. l stood back and
looked at the wide array of employees. Jeff, a
fellow waiter. was licking his lips and had
bulging red eyes. He's always speeding
working two jobs, trying to support the wife
that he married when he was 18. He's been in
and out of drug programs since he was 14. l
avoided him. He was notorious for talking you
to death. _

l turned to the rigltt and saw Waiter, tlte
cook. Prize lighting had claimed his two front
teeth. He stood over the grill with a cigarette
in the empty space. He has a large, black,
muscular physique. After lighting, he broke
bones for someone he refuses to talk about.
Then he left his wife and learned how to cook.
He’s got a son in college and a daughter doing
time for armed robbery. He loves his kids and
takes care of them in the best way he can. Any
words against them. even in jest, are
answered with a fearful. threatening stare.
Waiter gives his son money so he can get
"good coke, not that street bullshit. lknow
he's gonna do it anyway". He believes in
himself arid speaks his mind freely. "No. i
don't have any regrets, not one in the world".
Walter, now 50. also indulges on occasion.
Drugs are not scarce among the clientele or
the employees. The club houses an
atmosphere of decadence which caters tothe
young, the attractive, and the wealthy. Sex is
always a major topic of converstation. Tips
don't always come in dollars and cents. This is
Walter's habitat. He has a warm, youthful
disposition. His loud. bellowing laugh
resounds through the kitchen.

“Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all, l'm happy."

The door to the kitchen slammed open attd
two official looking men stumbled in,
mistaking it for the bathroom. The
dishwashers scrambled for the staircase.
They thought it was the Dep't oi intrnigration

—— false alarm.

l grabbed my tray and headed over to the
service bar. Nicky, the bartender grabbed my
glasses and started mixing the drinks. He
came to the States when he was 17 from
Yugoslavia after his parents were murdered.
He's since saved all his money to buy his first
two loves. A new Trans Am and a pistol which
he keeps under the front seat.

“Someday, i go back, gumba, get my sister.
Can't do it now, need the money,you know?"

I thanked "Gumba" for the drinks and we
exchanged smiles. We botlt wanted to stop
and talk bttt tinte would never allow it. The
crowded club, with all its extravagance, wasa
side show compared to the employees. The
clientele were referred to by a table number
or "the tail guy with the blonde wife". They are
seen as a stereotypical mass by the
employees. But the workers were all of
different etlttric, political and socioeconomic
backgrounds. They ranged from high fashion
models to ex‘cons front Harlem. Chances are
none of us would associate outside of the
cltib. Yet, behind the scenes, we all find to
work together and confide in eachother, The
kitchen was the only place where we could
“blow off some steam" and be ourselves.
Everything happened in fast motion. i had to
remain alert and composed while my senses
were jatnmed with lights, music, smoke and
questions from often drtink customers. But i
couldn‘t be moody with anyone. if you don't
get along with the bartenders, you get weak
drinks. if you don't hit it off with the cook,
your food is the last to be cooked. llyou don't
like the bttsboy and let him know it, your
tables are the last to get bread. water, or
cleared. Everyone has strings that they can
pull and its understood. So everyone is
accepted.

i grabbed my tray and headed for the door.
The drinks were already late. I weaved my
way through the crowd and delivered the
drinks. Just then three men in business suits
walked in, all with similar haircuts, similar
watches. and similar shoes. i made a bee-line
for the table. Businessmen are always good

for 15 percent. 1 slid ittto my "friendly but.

efficiettt" attitude and took their order
smoothly.
Then two high school disco queens walked

in. They're notorious for being outraged at

the prices, scrambling through their purses,
and barely paying the check with their last
pennies. The order was invariably the Same.

"Two Sloe Gin Fizzes, and we'll split a
salad."

i didn't expect a tip, and therefore gave the
table little attention. The higher the bill, the
better the service.

lreturned tothe kitchen tofetchthe drinks.
through the flashy jungle of people. it was 3
am. ~- only one hour to go., Eduardo. a 30
year old bisexual busboy was surrounded by
employees who were listening to him intently.
He was laying down an explicit description of
the gay bar he had went to the night before
and the cute little trick he nailed. '

"He was just like you, Cliff", he said,licking
his chops at me.

i winked at him jestingly as Walter grabbed
him on the rear.

"Oh, thank you so much", Eduardo said
with a broad smile.

Walter bellowed ottt another laugh. We all
broke up and leaned on each' ofher‘s
shoulders, shaking our heads in disbelief and
weariness. Suddenly, the owner walked into
the kitchen. We all straightened up and
returned to our respective duties. i got my
drinks, this time from Scott, a struggling
stand-up comedian, and went back onto the
floor.

A young. good-looking couple walked in. i
instantly noticed the man's plentiful jewelry
and expensive clothes. You learn how to spot

quickly in the waiting business. This was the
ideal table and i moved in tor the kill quickly.
With this type, it's mutual benefit — the better
you make him look, the thicker he makes
your wallet. Be friendly, funny, but don't steal
the show. i nursed the table accordingly and
he remained true to my typecasting, leaving
me $8.

 

  

On this note, the long awaited last call was
given. My role playing was over for one day.
Waiting is like acting «v give the audience
what pleases them and you leave wealthy and
popular. if you don‘t. you’ll be quickly
forgotten. When two pisanes ask you "you’re
ltalian, you say yes even though you're not,
because you know it’ll raise your tip. You're a
con artist who chages identity and atitude

the way of the world. lwalkedoutside and the
sounds of ist Avenue seemed muffled, as it
does after a heavy snow. The August sun,
however, had already begun it‘s ascent,
reminding me that it was only my
overcrowded mind and exhausted body. l
was wired turning to take one last look at the
club. i felt as if i had spent my earlier years as a
social mute. Here there was no padding or
hiding of life and its ways. it was a

 

kaleidoscope of urban people. their lifestyles,
arid their different values. lwalked away from
the club as i do from school —» thankful for its
knowledge, yet glad to bid it farewell. '

frightening change as Catherine oversees the
massacre of the Hugenots on St.
Bonaventure's Day. The play jokes about
everything except death, which it views as the
wasteful result of the political games of the
Wise. People in charge. All this variance of
tone and mood would be completely wasted if
the playwright didn't have an extraordinary
cast to bring them off gracefully, and in this
instance Mr. F_oster is very fortunate. The
Acting Company is just that, a company each
member of which contributes enormously to
the overall impact of what we see on stage. in

some players over others, bttt...

warrant ordering her decaptiation. her face

every muscle. She plays the Virgin Queen
with the wisdom and decisiveness that tnade
her the greatest, most powerful ruler of her

time. Laura Hicks succeeds in giving
Catherine a frightening duality. Her opening
scenes are marvelously funny, but then she
reveals the other side of the bashful, foolish
monarch, the uglier side, capable of having
thousands of people killed without caring in
the least. Then when she comes back on
stage, site can make us laugh again, that
viciousness lies just beneath the surface. This
is a rare example of being memorable without
being overbearing, or tipstagittg; this is what
great acting is all about.

Dunyu Ramicova) helps point up the

to use those words). They also make clearer
the parallel the author sees between then and
now, especially in sexual attitudes. Finally. let

Usher" frottt the Titles of Mystery album.

The longer extended cttts, not unlike the
longer Pink Floyd cuts, is what most Alan
Parsons fans have built their foliotvirtg on.
Floyd like synthesized effects (really Parsons
originated) are familiar throughout the album.
"Lucifer" is a five minute cut that comes
closest to llit‘ true Parsons sound. The special
effects and tension on this piece work well to
create suspense. "Lucifer" would fit in well as
part of the sound track to Midnight Express.
However, those typical Parsons masterpieces
that sometimes extend for entire album sides
are not found on litre.

Eue does have a theme to it. While the
theme on Tales of Mystery was obvious and
the themes on Pyramid and 1 Robot (whose
combined sales come close to one million
copies) were more elusive, the theme on Etta
must be hidden somewhere between the
grooves. Some of the tunes individually tell a
complete story. According to Alan Parsons
the theme is there and can be most simply
stated as to be about women.

evening of entertainment with more than just
a few poignant moments tltrown in for good
measure. '

Parsons

There are sortie musical and lyrk ".l
surprises as well as some typical Parsons
elements on Eve. "Damned if 1 Do" has the
familiar Parsons french horn section and
voice by Lenny Zaketck who appears on
previous albums by llit‘ Project. An attempt
to describe most of the tunes on Eve would be
futile as they are catered more for speakers
titan writers.

ThtI list of personnel on Eve does not
contain any well known names but Lesley
Duncan deserves a special note here. Her
smoothly textured vocal work on Andrew
Powell‘s arrangement of “if i Could Change
Your Mind" provides the album's finale with a
Stxitlting touch that just may be Eve's
highlight.

No matter what style of Alan Parsons'
you're ittto Erie is worth a shot.Whether
you're into the more cosmic Parsons or the
down to earth simple stuff. you just may find
yourself walking away whistling some of llit'
melodies. The expreienct- behind the album

ASPirin : For Headaches and Heal-Caches '

Dtitrr Jessica,

i am a sophomore girl who likes a
jttnior, and i know that he likes me
too. We have gone out on a couple
of dates, and we've both had it really
great time.

My problem is that [know he has
a girlfriend at lit)liit!,ill1(ll(l0l1'l have
the courage to ask him about her.
He has a few pictures of her in his
room which i have seen, so it
doesn't look like he's trying to hide
her front trie. The thing is, he's never
said anything about her, although he
has mentioned her to my
siritt'matcs.

All i want to know is if he is still
interested itt lit‘l‘ because i don't
want td be part of a "three ring
circus". what should i do?

Confused .rntl ('ttwartlly
Dear C 8: C,

The real solution to llit,‘ problem is
to come right otit and ask him about
his girlfirt-nd. it maybe hard bttt its
really the only way to fiitd out
exactly how he feels about her, and
how he feels about you, Maybe they
don‘t have a serious relationship
and they see other people.

if he hasn't mentioned her to you
1e obviously doesn't want you to
mow. Maybe he sees no reason to
ell you. if it's irttportant for you to
mow about his girlfriend, and yoti
tlon't want to be involved irt it"lltree
ring circus", then you‘re going to
have to ask him.

Dear Jessica,

My problem is my roommate. i
am a freshman and he is a transfer (a
jtrnior). He's a basically nice gtiy, btit
we're two different people.

i think l'rn pretty easy to get along
witlt. l'ttt kind of shy and keep to
myself and really don't bother
titty'one. i like to study, go to classes,
go to sleep early, and i really don't
like to get into hassles with anyone.

Unfortunately, my roommate is
beginning to hug me. He always has
on loud music ~ 7 from the minute he
wakes up in the morning until he
goes to bed (which usually isn-t utttil
3 or Al a.m.). And when he does go to
bed, he's always very noisy. l'trt
finding it really hard to study and to
sleep and it's driving nit‘ crazy. i atn

Annoyed in Clinton

Dear Annoyed,

Matty people living in dorms with
.t roommate have the same problem
that you have. Any time two or
more people are sharing a small
space there are hottnd to be a few
problems. but each party has to
learn to make sonte compromises.

Have you tried discussing this
with ltini?'l'm sure'if‘hc'knew he was
annoying you, (you say he's
basically a nice guy) he'd try to do
something so as not to btig you so
much. if you haven't said anything
he honestly may not realize that this
is bothering you. Maybe you could
ask him not to play the music after a
certain time so that you could sleep,
and you could study in the library
rather than in your roont.

The only way you can solve
anything is by talking to each other,
and once you brint it up he may be
more titan willing to compromise.

Bring (iff letters to Compus Center
329, and ptrt them in the Arts
Editor's mailbox. Letters must be in
by Tuesday to uppcar by Friday.
