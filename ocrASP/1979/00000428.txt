nuclear power only makes sense if nuclear

one receives from color TV. Did we narrowly
avert a much worse accident? A melt down
would ltave required a temperature of 5000
degrees F.: the highest temperature actually
reached was about 2000 F.

This is not to say that worse accidents are
literally impossible. But the probability ofa
melt down is. according to ttiost experts.
substantially less than that of a major dam
bursting (which could. kill tens of thousands)
or a major refinery fire or art airplane crash in
Shea Stadium during a big gante. There can be
legitimate disagreements about estirttates of
this kind. but the highest estimates of nuclear
risks seem to me to result ritorc frortt a quasi-
tlteological view of radiation as EVIL.
cotttbirted witlt blind ltostility to big business
“ntonopolists”. than frortt arty balanced view
of the risks and benefits. liven ltcrc the anti-
nuclear crowd is inconsistent. These same
ntonopolists. who are said to like nuclear
power becattse they control the world‘s
uranium supply are also fa\otitbly disposed
toward tltc tlcvcloptttcnt of :itotrtic fusion
plants. wlticlt. of course. would suit on lt‘tlll'l‘.
that cannot be monopoli/ed. In contrast the
advocates of solar power approve of ltttildittg
dams. which are as centrali/ed as nuclear or
Coal fired plattts. (Solar pouct by tltc way. if
officially defined to include all rcrtewablc
sources of energy. such as hydroelectric power
arid wood.)

Ultimately those of us who are rtot
ourselves nuclcarcttgincer s must decide which
experts to trust. it judgement that will
irtevitahly be based on our assessment of the
riiotives. preconceptions and interests oftliose
who claim to speak witlt autltorily. and
perhaps. ntost important. on the actual safety
record of existing plants. No ntcntber of the
general pttblie has yet been injured by a
nuclear power accident.

lThe Return Of. Symmetry

At last Edward Durell Stone can rest in peace. His dream of SUNYA as the Mecca
of Symmetry has been realized. the balance of nature restored.

Perhaps this is confusing. Let‘s back up a minute and explain. What is being
discussed here is the return of students to Mohawk Tower and what this means. The
first myth that must be dealt with is that of Mohawk Tower being rcpopulated to
merely case the housing shortage.

This is a hoax whose magnitude must surely rank with that ofthePiltdoanfan. The
real reason becomes apparent when today‘s juniors and seniors think back to their
freshman year.

Remember back to those nights ofdrinking at Suttcr‘s. grabbing a box of Freihofers
at Sltop Rite (when Freiltofers only cost 77¢ a box) and then walking that long road
back to the dorms.

In the distance one saw the bell tower. with its lonely ligltt blinking in the night,
warning ntigratirtg birds away. To the west rises the stately towers of Dutch and
Colonial.

As orie's eyes swing eastward. one spots an entpty void. Yes. there is State‘s Eastman
Tower. yet there is nothing else. Only darkness. The sight fills one with a strange
emptiness. tt feclirtg of unfulfillnicnt. a longing for some undefined something M a lit ,
Mohawk 'l'ower.

How ritatty lttdiait Quad students were lost irt the stiowdriflsas their fellow students
followed their towers back to the dorms“? Possibly. we will never know. ‘

Evert rttore pitifttl was the dope-eralcd student trying to force ltitttsclfto rationalirc
and accept ati environment wltcrc a bttslt on one end oftltc campus was symmetrically
matched with its clorte-counterpart on the opposite end. while at the same time seeing
a dark arid cmpty tower ruin the aesthetics of night-time SUNYA.

So when adntinistrators start talking of their desire to move the Political Scicttce
offices back onto the podittrtt as tltc reason for Mohawk‘s rcpopttlatiott when
residence talks about tltc extra 400-sonte odd beds as the reason when UAS smiles
beca use tltc quality of Indian Quad food has now fallen to the depths oftltc other three
quads now that they‘re cookittg for 400 rttorc rcntcmbcr ltow the campus ttsed to
look at night. -

' Rest well. Edward Dttrell Stone. rest well.
