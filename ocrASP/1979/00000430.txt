with ﬁve strike outs. was losing his
authority on the Red Dragon
batters. and he called on Woods to
put out the fire. Esposito said. “!'m
happy. This is the longest I‘ve ever
gone (6 innings). I could‘ve gone all
the way. but it‘s not my decision. it's
tip to the couch."

Woods came in to relieve. but
only complicated the situation. He
walked the first britter he faced and
gave tip a sharp single to right field
to load the bases. That was all for
Woods. Skcel called to the bullpen
once more for the Albany ace.
(‘labeatm to try to ptrt out the fire.
This time Skirel tirade the right call.

The first batter (‘labeaux faced hit
into a Ri\‘et‘a-to-Rolands-to-
McCarthy double play. with rt run
scoring. This made the score 2-l
with a man on third and two outs.
('labeaus then pitched to the next
batter. forcing him to fly out to
ecrrterlicld to end the game.

said. "It Iclt good to pitch but I

After the game. Skecl said, "I'm
really proud. We beat a class ball
club. Oneontn really couldn'tafford
this loss. We‘re not just wearing
uniforms and playing ball -— we're a
team now."

Third baseman Bob Arcario.
undoubtedly the best percentage
hitter on the team. hitting over .500
with seven RBl‘s. commented on the
win. “We‘re a young team and we‘re
on our way. This win is the turning
point."

On the superb defense that the
Danes showed in the doubleheader.
Skeet said: “Rivera and Esposito
were the key to the defense. but
Esposito looked better than
anybody. This was the best pitching
we ever had."

Albany travels to Potsdam
tomorrow in a crucial doubleheader.
"Potsdam is very important for us to
sweep." said Skecl.

Forthe Albany batrncn to make
noise this year. maybe they should
listen to a sign that is posted abort
Skccl's‘ desk: "'l'eamwork will mrtke
the Difference."
