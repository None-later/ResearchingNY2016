expected to miss at least IO to l4
days. and possibly as long us the
remainder of the season. with a
hypercxtended knee suffered against
Onconta. Arango is still musing a
bruised knee sustained against
Cortland on September l9th and
will likely nrissut least another week.

Their replacements will be tested
