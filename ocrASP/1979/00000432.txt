The Albany State baseball team
began the week on a somewhat
dismal note, but by Wednesday
evening the Great Dane Batmen
were ﬂying high.

Monday. the squad faced a
somewhat impressive team hailing
from North Adams State. about 40
miles southeast from Albany. North
Adams State. as it turned out. is not
sanctioned by the NCAA for their
baseball team to play an official
game outside of their home
Massachussetts state. making the
game a mere exhibition.
Nevertheless. Albany showed a poor
performance on the ﬁeld. having
three players picked-off ﬁrst base
and three foul-pops dropped. all

leading to a 3-l loss.

After the game. Albany State
head coach Rich Skecl said. "I‘m
very discouraged. we had some guys
out there that made us look like we
never practiced.”

Something had to be done. lfthe
baseball team was going to get
anywhere, “we had to get rid of the
ghost of losing past." Skeel said.

Tuesday. prior to the start of
practice, the coaches and players got
together for a meeting to sort out

problems that might have hindered
the players on and off the ﬁeld and

to “shake some feathers loose,"
according to Skecl. l‘itchcr Rich
Woods stated that the meeting wasa
“talk about attitudes and how to
relate with people - not just
baseball. The meeting showed that
the man we're working for is a real
'class~man‘."

Wednesday was another day. and
it turned out to be a big day. The
Danes faced a super team in
Oneonta State. The Red Dragons
entered the game with a 7-3 league
record and 10—4 overall. As it turned
out, the home‘Albany team split it
tough doubleheader.

The Red Dragons came out on
top in the ﬁrst game by the score of
9-5 with Bob Rhodes clouting two
home runs. over the right-centcrand
left-ﬁeld fences. “He (the Oneonta
pitcher) got the ball up and I went
with the pitch." stated the
designated hitter.

This loss set pitcher Mike
Clabeaux‘s record at l-2. "Mike
wasn't able to put the hall where he
wanted it. Oneonta also had a lot of
bloopers." Itated Dane catcher
Willie Guerra.

After the ﬁrst game loss. Skeel
commented, “I'm not disappointed.
They had ﬁve germane (hard G
sound) bleederst." A german is

Throughout the many years that
Brockport has ﬁelded a football
team, one thing could usually be
counted on season after season. The
Golden Eagles have a losing
tradition on the gridiron. and they
have never really been considered
a quality opponent.
/ That is, until recently. Brockport
reached rcspcctabllily last year — a
5-4 record. and this season. the
Eagles have set their goals higher.
Posting wins in their ﬁrst two
contests. the Eagles faced Buffalo
last week. and after leading 18-3 at
halftime. Brockport folded. and was
defeated 32-25. The game ended
with the Eagles on the Buffalo six
yard line. and on the final play
possible interference penalty on a
pass in the endvonc was not called.
80 heading into Blocker Stadium for
tomorrow night's meeting with the
2-0 Albany State football squad. the
Eagles are 2-l. and ready to
challenge their negative image.

“Brockport is a much'improvcd

,team," said Albany head football
coach Bob Ford. “They have done a
good recruiting job. We‘ve played
against them the last few years. and
they did not have a
tradition. On any team. you seem to
play your best against teams you
have respect for. Any time you don't
take someone seriously. that‘s when
you get upset. And I know
Brockport is going to come iii here
smoking.“

The Eagle‘s strength lies iii their
offense. where they are led by a ﬁrst
your player. Quarterback Scott
Zahn (6-l. 200) is a freshman. but in
his ﬁrst three games. he has shown
nothing but veteran qualities. In his
debut he was named ECAC Rookie-

. of—the-chk. and seven days later

came EC‘AC l’laycr-of-thc-chk.

parasitic hall." He added. “'l'licir
(Onconta's) balls had eyes on them.
Our balls were “at-cm“ halls-hit
right at them."

Noncthelss. if Albany could
squeak-out a split of the
doubleheader. Skccl would have
been satisfied. The Danes put
together a ﬁne effort. beating
Oneonta in the night-cap. Z-l.

The Danes put together their two
runs in the home fourth inning with
a two-out rally that started when
Rhodes legged-out an infield single.
Matt Antalek followed with a triple.
scoring Rhodes from first. Next up
was hitting star Rich Cardillo.
whose hit proved to be the winning
RBI. slamming a double down the
right-field line. scoring Antalek
from second.

A more than commendable effort
by pitcher Mike Esposito saved the
Danes from a Red Dragon sweep.

Esposito really had no true threat
put up against him until the sixth
inning, when be loaded the bases
with one out. But he struck out the
ﬁnal two men of the inning to send
the Oneonta drive past the boards.

In the ﬁnal inning. Esposito
opened with a walk on a 3-2 pitch.
Skeel felt that Esposito. who

Against Buffalo, Zahn completed
nine of l7 passes for Do yards.

“For a freshman. he looked

excellent against Buffalo," said
Albany split end coach Don
Fouracrc. who scouted Brockport
last week. “He stepped right in there
and showed he could throw the ball
accurately. He‘s very poised and
smooth. For a freshman, I couldn't
believe it."

In addition to the passing attack
the Eagles are also capable of
moving on the ground. From their
Wing-T setup. fullback Larry Settles
(5-l0. 210) and
lloykins (5-l0. I65) share the hrtint
of the rushing load, and both were
effective against Buffalo. Settles had

It: carries for 79 yards. while Boykins ‘

amassed 7| yards in only eight
attempts.

“Settles is a strong fullback andl
powerful runner." Fouracrc said.
"He carried the ball the bulk of the
time. Boykins isjust a speed demon.
He's the key to their offense.“

Zahn‘s favorite receivers are Roy
Voliton((i-l.180)tind freshman Mike
McCabc (6-l. 205). Last week. Zahn
connected with McCabe on four
passes for 63 yards.

“In our first two games. we faced
one-dimension offenses. .aid Ford.
“Brockport is more balanced w they
can run and throw. That will be a
test for us."

One look at the Buffalo game. arid
it is cletir that the Eagle defense
must be labeled inconsistent. After
allowing only three points at
halftime. the Brockport defense fell
apart. and Buffalo piled on 22 points
in the third quarter a week ago. Not
only inconsistent. but also
inexperienced - the Eagles start
seven players who are either
sophomores or freshman on
defense.

halfback Neil '

Thcir 5-2 defense is led by tackle
Don Colerick (6-2. 240). “Before the
season. he was being billed asan All-
American candidate.“ said Albany
secondary coach Tony Diangc,
who also scouted the Eagles last
week. “and he was tough. He madca
lot of hustling tackles - he was all
over the field."

At the monster back spot is Rick
Willett (5—ll. 200). who totalled 2l
solo tackles in his first two games.
Other key performers for Brockport
arc linebacker Fred Bence and
middle guard Jeff Quartaro.

“Their defense looked porous at
times ttnd great at other times."
commented Diangc. "Buffalo had
the ball on the five yard line. and
Brockport held them off four times.
and Buffalo had to settle for a field
goal. And then they give tip 22
points iii one quarter."

For the Danes. two players are
listed as doubtful to see any action at
lllcckcr Stadium tomorrow night.
Defensive tackle Steve Sltoen did
not play last week against Southern
Connecticut because of it pulled
hamstring, and will probably be
shelved against Brockport.
llalfhack Sam Haliston also
aggravated his hamstring. and eotild
be out tomorrow.

Defensively. Albany cannot get
iiittcli better. With two shutouts in
their first two games. the Duties
third game comes against a team
that poses a double threat. Hobart
was strictly a running team. and
Southern Connecticut was chiefly u
throwing club. ()1) offense. though.
Albany has significant rooin for
improvement. The Dunc wishbone
has yet to get untracked. “We‘re
trying to get our offense squared
away; there's a lack nft‘onsistcncy."
Ford said.
