 

Cttmpus Asbestos Below
Safety Guideline Levels

 

Results From Air Samples

by Charles Bell

Asbestos is present in various
locations on SUNYA's uptown rind
downtown campuses. although at
levels below federal safety
guidelines. according, to New York
State Health Department ofﬁcials.

The agency released its findings
yesterday in a study of potential
asbestos contamination in SUNYA
buildings. Results were based on air
and content samples taken on both
campuses two weeks ago.

“In cases where asbest'os was
found we are moving to either
remove or encapsulate any asbestos
materials." said SUNYA Physical
Plant Director Dennis Stevens.

The New York Public Interest
Research Group. Inc. (NYPlRG)
claimed last January that the federitl
asbestos level standards were
inadequate. threatening individuals
with asbesteosis, a serious lung
disease. While air samples taken
where asbestos was found contain
less than the maximum allowable
level, SUNYA's stated policy has
been to eliminate the material's

threat. according to Stevens.

The investigations came after
NYPlRG identified several areas on
campus where fire-retardant
coatings of ceiling tiles may contain
asbestos. NYPlRG‘s own
investigation pointed to possible
asbestos content in Alumni Quad
dormitory ceilings and in a food
storage room in the kitchen of
Alden-Waterbury Cafeteria.

SUNYA Vice President for
University Affairs Lewis Welch
said the study showed no asbestos
content iii any campus residence
areas (student rooms or suites).
However, asbestos was discovered
to comprise 25 to 40 percent of
sound-insulators located in a
Colonial Quad machine room. a
foyer and equipment room in Alden
Hall, and in Waterbury‘s kitchen
store room.

The Waterbury storcroom was
closed last week after the potential
health threat was revealed.

“It was not necessary to continue
rising the storeroom. so the prudent
course was to clear the area." said

remain empty until asbestos
material on the storcroom ceiling is

' ’ Chemistry Pli.D. Program
 Awaiting Reinstatement

by Laura I’lorentino

In hopes of being reiiisiated by
the State Education Department
(SED). the SUNYA Clieirristry
doctoral program is undergoing
restructuring. according to Actitig
Chemistry Department Chair
Ramaswanry Sarina.

“The doctoral program in
Chemistry was suspended two years
ago following the report ofthe SEI)
which said that the department did
not meet the requirements." said
Sarma.

SUNYA chose to suspend the
program rather than terminate it.
explained SUNYA President
Vincent O‘Leary. because it wont
make reinstatement less ditticrilt.

Limited student enrollment

precipitated the program’s
suspension, said Sartna. Only 45 out
ofa required number of 90 students
enrolled in the program. SED
officials suggested that the
department increase its enrollment
to meet a faculty/student ratio of
one to four.

“I feel that this number is
unreasonable because not a single
department in the nation can meet
this requirement offour students per
faculty member," said Sarma.

In addition, SUNYA's program
was compared to those of New York
State institutions such as Cornell
and Columbia Universities and
Rockefeller lnstitrite. “When

“We will probably attempt to rise

that they might come as a special
