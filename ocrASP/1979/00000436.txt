programs. we cannot compete. but
we still have a fairly good
department." Sarma said.

In 1978. at the request of the
university administration. a
committee of three distinguished
chemists evaluated the Chemistry
PILD. department.

“They found that SUNYA was
welljustified in wanting to operate a
I’h.D. program in Chemistry and
reported that we did have the
resotlrces to do so." explained
Sarma. The group offered
suggestions for improvemenmt.
“We are now trying to implement
these recoriimciidalions." added
Sarina.

('Iianges in the program include
recruiting a new chairman. "We
hope that by employing a notable
figure as chairman of the
department. it will attract more
stttdents and initiate changes which
will improve ottr program." said
Sarina.

Chemistry PhD. Program

“If we get a good outside
chairman and continued support
from the administration. we can get
the program back in six to sevun
months time. If. however. we are
unable to get a notable chairman in a

short while. we will not be able to get -

reinstated." he added. The
department is currenin searching
for prospective chairmen from
institutions such as Bell Labs and Jet
Propulsion Labs.
Undergraduate Chemistry
major Lew Sultan said. “With the
loss of the PILI). program there will
be less money for research. This will
hurt the department for undergrads
as well as grads. There was iI loss of
two faculty members since |977
because of the suspension of the
I’Ii.l), program. We can‘t do
research if the professors leave."
Surma believes there is an
alternative to the Chemistry
program. One possibility is to create
a doctoral program iii the Center for
Biological Macromolecules.

The center. which generates close
to $3 million a year In external
funds, can eventually evolve into a
"powerful" Department of
Molecular Biology and Bio physics.
“There are members of the
Chemistry faculty with strong ties to

' Physics and Atmospheric sciences.

May be they could become
associated with these departments."
said Sarma.

Sarina explained that the loss of
the Chemistry Ph.D. program could
have devastating consequences. He
added that one cannot Iiave a viable
University Center and a College of
Science and Mathematics without a
strong I’Ii,l). program in Chemistry.
The lack of such a program will
affect the vitality of the present
doctoral programs iii Physics and
Biology.

Fatal Bounce

NEW YORK (AP) A woman who
was bouncing on the bed of a New

.Ytll'h (‘ityhotel plunged to herdeath
.from the Zillli floor when she

bounced out the window. her
husband told police,

Police said Sylvia Mtininirios. of
Montevideo. Uruguay. was found
dead early today on the sidewalk
outside the 'I'al‘t Ilotel in midtown
Manhattan. Her husband, Bruno.

ion the hotel room bed and

aceidertttilly bounced right through
the window. police said.

Assaults

the suite were unlocked, but the
inhabitants claim that the outer
door was locked. “We're looking
into the possibility ofa faulty lock or
that the door was ajar.“ '_

On September 28. a man entered a
woman‘s shower room on the third
floor of Bruhacher Hall. He
apparently placed his hand inside
the shower. hut fled when the victim
began to scream.

The intruder is approximately 20

years of age, 69" tall. and ISO
|pounds. He has black hair. brown
'eyes, a medium build and'was
fv/earing a red pullover shirt.
However. according to Henighan.
there is no way to link this suspect
with the previous incidents.

Eugene I-Iudson, an Albany
resident. was arrested October I
after he was discovered roaming
about on the second floor of
Brubachcr Hall “for no apparent
reason," said Ruth. He was charged
with loitering. His description does
not match those of the other
suspects.

get a spring book out. they're not
going to stay over the summer to
finish a fall supplement.“ said
Weintraub.

Weintraiib feels that the poll was
unfair in that ii small sampling ot
class members is not necessarily
representative of the whole,

“I felt that it wasn't the best way to
do it.“ he said. “Perhaps SA should
develop a more accurate way of
surveying the senior class. maybe
during the SA election prior to the
senior year. SA should develop
some sort ol procedure as to how to
decide when the yearbook should
come out. But I think itsliould be tip
to the seniors when they want their
book."

Along with the yearbook
decision. seniors voted to match

SUNYA's $I500 allocation toward a
graduation speaker with class funds.

“It was an attempt to get a
graduation speaker of a better
caliber than we have had in the last
few years.“ said Weintraub.

'I’entative senior week plans. also
based on the pull. include a senti-
i’ormal and trips to Boston and
Montreal.
