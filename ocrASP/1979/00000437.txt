Vietnam Vet Blues

A recently-released study of
Vietnam veterans has concluded
that rrrore than 40 percent ofsoldiers
who participated in the Indochina
conflict currently suffer from major
emotional difficulties and alcohol
and drug abuse.

The report. a preliminary study of
Vietnam veterans. was prepared by
the New York-based center for
policy research. it was matle public
by the Veterans Administration
alter a group called “Vietnam
Veterans of America“ requested the
document under the freedom of
information act.

The Veterans Administration arrtl
certain Congressional members
have previously maintained that
veterans of the Vietnam War have
readjusted successfully to postwar
life in the lJ,S.

The stutly. however. which
involved 380 veterans in New York
and Connecticut. found that 40
percent have emotional and drug
problems. while as many as 75

percent complain of nigbmarcs.
marriage problems and job
difﬁculties.

Similar studies of veterans in the
South. Mid-West and West are

Through The Mall

We‘ve come a long Way since
Montgomery Ward put out the
United States first mail order
catalog.

High Times Magazine reports
that a Denver, Colorado, firm is
now publishing what'it calls the
Yankee Bean Calalug. The Yankee
Bean Catalog lists such things as a
disposable typewriter. which
allegedly puts an end to ribbon
changes: the makers claim you cart
type up to |().()()() words. then throw
it away. That sells fora mere $l9.95.

And then there‘s the Sav-a-
Krunclr cereal spoon. which makes
soggy cereal a thing of ihe past.
Reportedly. a simple squeeze of the
handle will release just the right
amount of milk into the spoon. This
tlcvicc sells for $8.95.

And how about the You (iota lot
to liver Cookbook. which leaturcs
over lt)5 recipes for this highly
nutritious arrtl inexpensive cut of
meat. Would you believe li\cr
turnovers. liver butter and jelly
sandwiches and liver meringue pic'.’
It‘s only $10.99.

crowd immediately began throwing
rocks and holtlcs...forcing Smith to
leave the stage.
