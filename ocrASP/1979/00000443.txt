"‘Something's wrong with Walter." '
"i feel down. that's all." Walter Ca'stornaxl
roamed the hollow of Penn Station. The dead'
time: burnt out witches wailing for a quarteiy
an ex-stuff-strutter. pep-stepper tapping In ai
corner to Muzak. No litter on.the floor but the!
living kind. Three or four in the morning. A!
raveled human lice colony bummed a:
cigarette off him. Bobby got mad. “What are;
you, a sucker? Shove off that disease." Buti

Scott warned him to get help to stop this:
perpetual weariness. He had lent him enough
money to see a psychiatrist. But Scott had”
showed up late to work a million times and he‘
was going to loose his hack. There was
enough for a few sessions. He had the first one
last week. The shrink was no use though. He
threw out words and asked questions. it did
no good. Bobby hated the whole idea. but,
Walter wanted to see it through at least
another time. Something was wrong, he knew
that much. He'd give the shrink another shot.
Walter needed air. He found an exit. Oni
the street a bus waited at an empty corner.‘
Waiter drifted down 8th Avenue. The creeps
shivered in the dark alleyways, talking to
themselves. and rubbing their hands. Walter
passed them. oblivious to their hisses and
whines. His thoughts rambled around in his
head. but nothing was clear. He didn't notice
the wired out )unkie who had been following
him for a few blocks. He was too tired to think. '
Sara loved the city at nigtt. She loved seeing
the skyscrapers lit up like Christmas trees. So
tall. so powerful. She felt warm being beneath
them. She trusted them. They would protect
her from the blackness outside their steel walls
and towers. She walked as if she was In a
hurry to get somewhere; her long legs stret-
ching over the cement. barely bending her
knees. The Junkie raced to catch up with her.
When she got to the corner she saw a sleek

 

 

limo pass by with a man and a woman in the
back. A street light danced over the woman's
face as the car whirled past. A lovely face. she
thought and Sara wished it was her in that
limo. touching the soft lips of that sweet thing,
holding her precious head. stroking her silky
hair. The limo slipped out of sight. and Sara
smiled. picking up her pace.

She approached a row of garbage cans
glowing from the red neon light of a Greek
restaurant. A footstep thudded behind her and
she heard a gasp of air. Before she could turn
she was pushed into the blood-ﬂashed metal
tins. sprawling over a rotten cabbage and
chicken bones. A wild eyed boy. a teenager.

blade in front of her.

Bobby shot back up. bursting into the
Junkie. ignoring the knife which dropped on
the concrete. He busted the kid’s head against
the wall. right on top of a glossy of the three
Greek accordian players which got smeared
with blood. After he fell, Bobby kicked him in
the gut until he spat out thick red goo. The
junkie was out. maybe he was dead. Bobby
backed off. He stumbled over a trash can lid
and spotted the knife. He grabbed it and clos-
ed it. stuffing it into his pocket. The junkie's
eyelids rolled up. Bobby felt sick. He blasted
down the street running wildly, blindly ' the
)unkie's eyes following him relentlessly.

By the time he stopped he didn't know
where he was. Someplace dark. Garbage
trucks stuttered up the far end of the street. it
must have been close to dawn. Bobby needed
to rest. He laid down in the shadow of a
building.

When Walter woke up all he saw were legs.
Naked legs and clothed legs passing in front of
the stinking alley he had slept in. He crawled
‘out. A few people watched him. not many.
He smiled. "Hi. i think i'm lost," he said to an
old lady who looked closer to death than he
did. She turned away.

Walter had some coffee at a diner. it was
eight o'clock. By nine he had to be at 87 Park
Avenue. That's where the Doc was. OK.
Doc. let me tell you my friends think I‘m going

crazy.
“You better leave now." Scott said.
“You're right." Walter chucked two

quarters on the counter. An overly made-up
waitress in a too light blue uniform scooped
them up.

Crissle wanted an apricot shoe leather.

"Come on Crissle. later, we haven't the
time." urged Scott checking his watch.

Crissle got upset. "Oh boy. you never buy
me anything. You're so mean."

“Crissle.” Scott demanded.

"Walter." Crissle cried out loud. The
truckers and salesmen and burns turned
around.

"How much?" Walter asked. pointing to the
shoe leather.

"Forty cents." the cashier said through a
half grin and a bewildered stare. He slapped
the change down on the counter and put the
leather in his pocket. Scott said nothing.
Crissle gloated. Walter Just wanted to get to
the shrink.

The psychiatrist's waiting room was pale
pink with wlerd pictures of circles and squares
on the walls. Walter tapped his foot. The
receptionist ignored his stares. He was the first
patient. The doctor wasn't in yet. It was nine
thirty. Walter borrowed a pencil from the
receptionist hoping to start a conversation.
What the hell is it with her, Walter thought.
when she didn't smile back at him. it's always
the hot looking donnas who are icebergs.
Maybe the Doc put her up to this. Maybe this
was part of the therapy. Everything made
sense now to Walter. and he sat down and
wrote a poem on the back cover of a
Psychology Today magazine:

over fifty times. The doctor came in and
Walter ripped out the page and sliuved it into

1 his pocket next to the shoe leather. Crissle
‘wanted the leather and tugged at Walter's
arm. He handed it to her and she chewed on it
while the doctor went into his office. A few
minutes later the buzzer and the receptionist
told Walter to go in.

The Doc's office was all brown and vinyl.
Walter sat In a brown vinyl chair opposite the
Doc's brown desk. Books everywhere. the
window looked at the Pan Am building. the
chair was do damn comfortable that as soon as
he sat down Walter had trouble staying.
awake.

The Doc looked at a sheet of paper on a
clipboard. He was bald. wore glasses, had on
a tweedy foreign cut suit. looked like he
played tennis and logged.

“Are you comfortable“

"Yes." Waiter groggled half asleep.

"Fine." The Doc smiled and scribbled down
some notes. "ln our first session we discussed
you're relationship with your father. how‘
respected a physician he was. and how much
you admired him. You also mentioned how
hard It was for him after you mother’s death.

Walter?"

“Walter’s asleep"

The doctor looked up. from his notes.

“What was that?" he asked ﬂipping on a
tape recorder on his desk.

"Walter's asleep."

"1 see. he said. leaning in towards his pa-
tient. “And who are you?"

“i'm Henry."

"1 see. Henry. and you say Walter is sleep-

ng.

"That's right. He had a rough night last
tight. you know."

The doctor didn't expect this. He stood up
and walked over to a chair next to Henry's.

“What happened?" He had to contain hi5
enthusiasm.

"Well. i can't say."

"Why not?"

"~Bobby'll get mad." Henry looked around
to see if Bobby was nearby. He wasn't.

“How old are you Henry?" The Doc asked.

"l'm seventeen."

"And what do you do? Do you go to
school?"

"i used to go to school, but i got kicked out
for beating the hell out of this nun." Henry
chortled. bobbing his head and blushing.

"When was that?"

"A few weeks ago."

“How old Is Walter?"

“Old.”

“How old?"

"Ninety-five. How should i know?" Henry

clawed at the arm rest. “'l'hirty-seven. i

“i see. And who is Bobby?"

"Walter's friend. They're t‘ll Walter's

Henry stood up. "i don't know what you're
talking about. Leave me alone."

The doctor cursed himself for pushing too
far, too fast. “Alright Henry." ‘

Henry went to the window. "Bobby hates
me." He watched the tiny creatures crossing
the street below. “He hates everyone.
especially me."

Good, good. the doctor thought. "Well
what does Walter do about that?"

“Protects me." ‘

“Can he protect you now?"

“Yeah. Sure. he can."

"Then Bobby can't hurt you."

“Right. he can't hurt me if Walter's around"

"So why worry " ‘

“Right.  let me tell you." Henry looked
around. "See Bobby..."

“Shut up Henry."

“Bobby. i didn't say anything." Henry ran
behind the desk. his face ouivering. his eyes
tense. The doctor sat confused and shocked.

Bobby knocked over a lamp. “You
miserable rat. You fink."

"Come on Bobby, it's not true."

"l'm sick of you. all of you."

Bobby threw a tantrum. knocking
everything off the desk, thrcwing,books. He
hurled the tape recorder at the window. The
shattered glass flew across the room. The doc-
tor scrambled over the desk top and grabbed
him. -
“Walter. Walter." Henry yelled as he shrug-
ged off the doctor and bolted the door. he

Henry ran to the elevator. He banged on
the button a thousand times until it opened.
He dashed in. The doors closed. He was
alone. Sweat poured out of him in a rush. He
breathed a million times a minute as he leaned
on the rail and watched the red lights go down
and down. Hurry. he begged.

“You scum."

Bobby grabbed him. Henry shuttered. “l

"You would have."

The elevator slid down to the eighth floor. it
stopped. it opened. A fat lady got in. Bobby
pushed himself flat against the back wall. The
elevator dropped to the lobby. Bobby got out.
He rushed through the glass doors of the
building and ran down the street. bumping
and rebounding off startled pedestrians. He
scrambled through the traffic stream and
crossed the street, running as fast as he could.
Flooding his head were voices. “No Bobby.
Bobby don't do this to us. We want to live."
Bobby ran with his hands clasped over his
ears. He forced them out. Suddenly his legs
collapsed as if he had been tackled. His hands
scraped against the rough concrete. and he
crawled into a narrow space between two red
brick buildings. Panting furiously he wiped the
stinging sweat out of his eyes and hoped the
others would leave him. There was silence. At
last. His heart pounded like a fist against his
chest. He pulled out the knife from his pocket.
He opened it. The blade was dull and chipped
but it would do. The. edge stroked his wrist
very lightly. A thin white line followed the
edge and faded. Bobby smiled. it would do.

He flew off the ground and into the brick
wall across the alley. Blood tickled his upper
lip. The knife flung out of his fist and clanked
in a dark corner. “Get out. Ge‘ out. Get out.“
a thick. granite voice commanded. “Who is
he‘l" they asked in whispers. glad to be saved
but unsure of the stranger. "Where's Walter?"

"Walter's asleep."

“Get out." the brute repeated. "and never I
show up here while I live." l‘lt! put his outstret-
ched hands on the wall and roared. "Who are
you? Do you know Walter?" they asked afraid
at his power.

"i am John." he said lifting his eyes to the
white streaked blue strip of sky between the
'shadows of the buildings. “i'm a friend of
Walter's." John walked out of the alley. his
head proudly erect. looking at the parked cars
and pigeons ilutiing at window sills with the
wonder of a child. -

Dear Jessica.

l have a problem concerning
school and i’m hoping that maybe
you would know something 1 could
do about it.

Last semester l took a course
which i got a B in. ldid all the work,
did great on the tests so i think i
deserved an A. I talked to the
professor but he wouldn't change
the grade. 1 never got along too well
with him and 1 think that has
something to do with it.

is there anyone else i can go to
about having the grade changed?
C.S.,lndian
Dear Jessica.

My composition teacher told me
today that i'm failing his class. We
missed a few classes and he told me
that it i miss one more i'm going to
fail for the semester. Can he do this?
Flunking on Fulton
Dear CS. and Flunking,

i called the registrar's office and
they put me in touch with Dr.
ljplilsl’tl in CUE for both of these

 

problems. Concerning grade

changing. he told me that the
procedure is to first thoroughly
discuss the situation with the
professor. if that doesn't do any
good, speak to the department chair
and explain the problem to him. You
will probably have to file a complaint
with the Grievance Committee. if
you have any further questions
concerning this you can go into
CUEandgetanoutlineonhowtogo
about bringing this before the
Grievance Committee.

As far as class attendance goes.
Dr. ljpinski told me that it is up to
the instructor. As long as he
announced the attendance policy to
the class at the beginning of the
semester, the class is responsible
for sticking to it. and the teacher can
fail a student for being absent from
class too many times.

Dear Jessica. .

1 work in a restaurant near the
campus that a lot of students come
to. i'm a student too. so iknow how
hard it is to be on a limited budget.

 

Aspirin : For Headaches and Heal-aches

The reason i'm working is to have
some spending money, but
waitresses don't make much from
their salaries and depend mostly on
tips. Twice this week students have
come in. ordered meals. paid for
them and left without leaving a tip. if
they could afford the meal. they
could afford to leave at least a small
tip.

i'm sure that there are other
waitresses on campus who feel the
same way and we just want
everyone to know that we deserve
to be paid for what we do.

Waiting for Tips
Dear Waiting,
Here is your letter-~l hope it helps.

 
   

Bring all letters to Campus Center
329, and put them in the Arts
Editor's mailbox. Letters must be in
by Tuesday to appear by Friday.
