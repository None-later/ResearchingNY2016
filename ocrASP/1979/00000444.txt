Quinn’s Very Own Din

To the Editor:

This University, year in and year out
constanin neglects the needs of its students.
last year I wrote a coltrrnn in which i stated
that not one professor seems to care about
students at all. I was not surprised when no
one responded in defense of professors'
actions. This year the advisement system has
coniinucd in its pitiful state and just goes to
prove how far SUNY Albany has to go before
it becomes a major university center. As it
stands now it is merely a faceless structure
whose job is to shuffle students as papers and
not as people. I refuse to be treated like
garbage. I've workcd hard to waste my money
on getting an education at this “place”.

Perhaps an example will explain my
bitterness over the sorrowful state of the
advisement process.

lam a senior who transfercd here last year.

_ In this limited time I've had ﬁve ofﬁcially

designated advisers. No one. but no one. in
the Political Science Department is a
responsible enough individual to advise
students. they just won't do it. If you are
considering becoming a Poly-Sci major. do
not declare so until the last possible minute,
because once you declare your major you will
never be advised again.

The people in CUE aren‘t much better. In
September I called up trying to arrange for an
appointment to see Mr. Robert (iibson about
ﬁling my LSAT application. I explained the
need to speak to him by September 13 when
the application was due. Despite this they said
I couldn‘t talk to him until after September
I51h. Icallcd the Dean ofStudents Ofﬁce who
tried to throw ihc blame over to it Ms.
DcFossc. an administrator in charge of the
advisement system. I'm sure she was surprised
when I showed up in her office! After
explaining to her my advisement difficulties.
she took my name and number and said that
she would work something out. She never
called back, No wonder the advisement
system stinks. Finally I saw I’rcsidcnt ()'I.criry
outing on Indian Quad. I told him my story
and he took my name and said he would get
back to me the tick! day. 'liircc days later
someone called back for Mr. ()‘lcar-y stating
thatarr appointment with Mr. (iibon could be
arranged. A week later we talked but after i
had made all of the critical decisions on my
own.

The point is that the advisement process  a
joke. If you have to get the University
President to arrange for an appointment the
system is unopcrablc. Ilcing so. I advise all
students to totally undermine the system by

Sealing I‘Last
Wave’s’ Leaks

To the Editor:

in the September 25 issue of ASP. Mark
Rissier attacked the Australian film “The Last
Wave". currently screening in Albany. The
comments of this cultural philistine (and
perhaps I should add racist). require a reply
from those who appreciate the film and
respect other cultures. What Rossicr calls
“aboriginal garbage" is Weir's skillful
depiction of the lifestyle. predicament and
religion of our urban Australian Aboriginris.
Rossicr completely fails to understand that
“the Drcariitirric-"is a life philosophy in which
our indigenous people don't separate
slccp,’drcutn states frotn their daytime
activities.

The film depicts an upper class white
(clinrnberlinl attempting to deal with this
Aboriginal reality licdocs so bydcsccraiing
a sacred site.

Wcir is no "armrteur liluunrrkcr" his filrrr
“Picnic at Hanging Rock“ and "The last
Wave" have i'cccivcd acclaim and great
success in Australia and New York City.
"Picnic at Hanging Rock" won tliczrwrrrd for
best foreign film at (‘trnries l-‘ilni l-'eslivu| in
the year it “as rclczrscd.

l’crhrrps it is bccztusc \Vcrr is not an
American and doesn't picsctit orgies of
vrolcncc or pct'tcrsc sexual encounters that he
fails to excite Rossicr,

It is it great pity that Rossici ri'vm/i the plot
and concluding scenes ol the rumic this is
like someone lL‘\lL‘\\‘iilg an Agatha Christie-
iypc nto\ ic and revealing \sho the murderer is.

If you haven't seen "llic lust Wave"
t'ht't‘lt it oul.’ If you have not yet read Rossicr's
rcvicw (/rlli'l. at least not until you have
seen this film.

“The Last Wtivc" will help you to
understand something of tire current struggles
of native peoples against gctiocidc. notjust in
Australia. but in this country also.

No Time To Run

To the Editor:

Let me begin by apoligizing to Professor
Uppal for leaving last Wednesday before the
class had been dismissed; I intended no insol-
encc. However. the incident characterizes a
situation which has been exacerbated this
semester by the irregularity of scheduling
times. 'l o wit: the harried time schedule we are
regulated to keep between classes.

Three days a week we are permitted only ten
minutes in which to transpose our attentions
and energies from one subject to another
unrelated one. During this interlude we must
pack our belongings and journey the length of
the campus. all the little maintaining some
countenance of friendliness; a feat worthy of
(icorgc Rccvcs. The matter is worsened when
professors insist on lecturing pzrsl thcirallotcd
time. Since students “Ill generally rcmarn
scaled. albeit noisily, out 01 courtcsy. we
expect some courtesy in return. this simply
entails dismissing the class on time or.
perhaps. crcn a few minutes early. so that we
need not rrrtcrrupt one of your colleagues at
the strut of his lecture. I realilc that there are
only f'ourtccn neck to it semester and that
professors are brimming with a gusto to
teach. but l'm certain that you will lime a
greater percentage of our concentration and
appreciation by extending this privilege.
Thank you.

The Hut

The recent resignations of ﬁve Central Council members force us to reexamine the
makeup of student government here, and examine its effectiveness. ,

The problems Student Association and Central Council face are two-fold.
Primarily. there is a lack ofinterest on the student's part. Anything accomplished is
done so by a select few. who diligently (and usually fruitlessly) devote many hours of
time to attaining small advantages, limited success. Secondly. there is the feeling that
the administration of SUNYA and SUNY have a tight hold on students, and allow
the SA‘s of the system‘s schools limited power. limited effectiveness. The men and
women working for you close their eyes to this. avoiding that reality.

Apparently. lack of student government stems from the fact that the majority of
students realize the severe limitations we are up against. and preferdevotingtheirtime
to activities that will bring about some results. For this. SA and Central Council are
not the way to go.

We are not ircre attempting to question the devotion or committmcnt of SA workers
and ofﬁcers or Central Council members whocndure their term. Rather. we are saying
that the sad reality is that these people who are working extremely hard against powers
that be. Powers that have the upper hand. and are too strong to overcome.

SUNY Central created the Student Assembly. for example. an essentially
powerless group that serves ihcrn well so tltcy can be able to insist that studcnts are
getting fair rcprcscntalion. This is not so. The Central Administration refuses to
rccogirilc SASU (Strident Association of the State University) as a representative of
SUNY students because they are hesitant to accept any group that has the sight to sec
that the administration has indccd crcatcd a brick wall. A group that refuses to be
satisfied because the administration has allowed one brick to he removed. The wall
still stands.

SUNY ('cntrul and SUNYA's one administration have an effective block against
student power, We are not saying that theyzrrc not actingin our best iirtcrcsts.just that
these men and women possessa certain fcarof allowing strrdcntsuny real control. And
the very fact that rulrninistrution leaders for Albany and all of SUNY do fcar giving
students arty power mukcs oitc wonder if their trims anti goals possiny coincide with
ours.

We have rroi created this wall. bttt SA and Central Council are powerless to
eliminate it. The .\lilt/i'lll.\ how not pitted students against administration, we are
simply victims of gross mistrust in the wake of strong activism a decade ago.

Being kept in the dark is bad cnough; being blinded is inexcusable.

Something ‘Fallfest’ This Way Comes

If children never grow up. btrt simply take on new images under the category of
adult. their let the child in us all escape for a time rind enjoy the simple fun and laughter
of Fallfest.

The neighborhood carnival. the clowns. the privcs‘. the rides, a rid the games all come

 

to life on none other than State Quad's parking for. this weekend. Take time off for
some legal regression. and enjoy the fantasy that's so entitled to us in the
SUNYA/world,’lifc pressure cooker.

Come one. come all, come ptirtyat Fallfcst ‘79. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.
