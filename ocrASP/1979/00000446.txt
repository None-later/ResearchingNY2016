Extra Inning Victories
Give Pittsburgh Edge

PITTSBURGH (AP) Consecutive
extra inning victories in Cincinnati
had the Pittsburgh Pirates ﬁred up
Thursday as they returned home,
hoping to ﬁnish off the Reds in their
National League Championship
Series.

“I‘m looking forward to my ﬁrst
World Series.“ said slugger Dave
Parker. whose 10th inning single
drove in the deciding run in the
Pirates 3-2 victory Wednesday.

The night before. it was it three-
run homer by veteran Willie Stargell
in the 11th that beat the Reds 5-2.

Those two close victories left the
I’iratcsjust one win away from their
first NI. championship since 197!
when they weitt on to beat Baltimore
in seven games in the World Series.

“We've worked very hard for
this." said shortstop Tim Foli. who
luts played a vital role in botlt
Pittsburgh victttries so far. “Now we
have a chance to wiit it before our
ltorttc fans and it‘ll be a big thrill."

It was Foli who doubled home a
controversial run iii the fifth inning
of Game 2 after second base umpire
Frank Pulli ruled right fielder Dave
Collins had trapped a leadoff drive
by Phil Garner.

Collins dived for the ball and
came up with his arm thrust in the
air. indicating he had made the

catch. But Pulli. dashing out from
his second base post. ruled that the
ball had ticket the turfbefore Collins
grabbed it.

Pulli said. “I called it ‘no catch.‘l
called it ‘-trap‘ all the way."

The Reds argued, of course. and
Manager John McNamara wanted
Pulli to ask for help from right field
umpire John Kibler. The baseball
rule book advises umpires that they
may seek help front a partner when
they are unsure about it call. But
Pttlli was sure and refused to ask for
Kiblcr's aid.

“It's my ctill and I made it." the
ttmpire said.

Garner moved tip oit a sacriﬁce
and then scored on a two-out double
by Foli. giving Pittsburgh a 2~l lead.
It stayed that way as Pirate reliefacc
Kent Tekulve weaved his way otit of
a bases-loaded jam iii the ciglttli.
The Reds tied it iii the ninth on u
piitcli double by Heity (‘ruv aittl
another two-base hit by Collins, But
then Omar Morcrto opened the
Pittsburgh 10th witha single. moved
tip on Foli's buttt and scored on
Parker‘s decisive hit.

The rods have left lli men oit base
in the ﬁrst two games antl that ltas
been pivotal. ' The slump has
McNamara troubled. btlt there's not
much he catt do except wait it out.

“Our only strategy is to wake up a
few of our bats.“ he said. “We have
been in a slump since mid-
September. There‘s not much
strategy."

Off Before Tackling Buffalo

by Paul Schwartz

Tomorrow, the Albany State football squad will face their most
unusual opponent ever — no one. Because of an unusual scheduling
situation. the Danes have a week off before their October 13th
matchup with Buffalo:

‘ Originally. Albany was schediiled to play Maryland-based Towson
State in tomorrow's openvslot. But ’I‘owson. a Division III last year.
opted to. move their program up to the Division I level of
competition. thus “severing relations“ with Division III Albany
State. according to Dane ltcud football coaclt Bob Ford. Ironically
the Duties faced Towson for the ﬁrst time a year ago, and Albany
gcfeated tltc Tigers. 37-28. No other opponent could be found to fit tltc

ate

“Sometimes ati off week can be a pick tip. but it could also be a let
down." said Ford. “Since we are not exactly wltcre we want to be as a
football team. it will give us a good opportunity to get things
together."

()nething that the week off could aid iit is the recuperation ofsomc
key injuries. Dane defensive halfback Don Bowen suffered a severely
sprained ankle in last Saturday's gitnte tig'tiinst Brockport. and along
With the nagging hamstrings of defensive tackle Steve Shocn and
halfback Sam Haliston. the absence oftt ballgamc will give the injuries
more time. “It will give its a chance to heal," said Ford. “but it also
could cause sortie tnorc ittjtiries iii the two weeks we have ofpracticc "
. Improving with each game. tltc 3-0 Danes will ltave till the extra
