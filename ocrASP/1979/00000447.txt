Schieffeiin was also pleased with

equalled the total that the Dragons
had allowed in their four previous
matches.

Albany must expect a bone
jarring game when they play host to
Brockport tomorrow afternoon at
2 pm. on the ﬁeld behind Dutch
Quad.

The Golden Eagles have gained a
rcptttation as one of the most
physical teams in the state.

"They are very hard nosed and
aggressive. We have the advantage
in skills though. if we can play a
control game we should be in good
shape." said Schieffelin.

indeed. Brockport seems to have
slackcd off after last year‘s
SUNYAC championship perfor-
mance. Their 2-3-l record thus far
includes a loss to Syracuse
University. whom Cortland
defeated 4-0.

Offensiver the Eagles are senior
Andre Sytnyk and sophomore
Gerald Pcckich. Brock ort coach

 
  
  
  
 
  

Walt Kopczuk calls Peckich “our
fastest forward" and has twice
tabbed him as the team's offensive
player of the week. Sytnyk is the
squad‘s top play maker. ‘

Kopczuk will count on eo-captaln
Rich Garcia to control the game
from his midfield po‘sition.

Although they‘ve lost three games
already. Brockport's strongest suit
appears to be defense.

Senior goalkeeper Ron Riley.
who posted six consecutive shutouts
last season including one against
Albany in the SUNYAC title game.
will again be defending the Golden
Eagle net.

Ron Cupeiio. the other co-
eaptain. and Eric Swanbcck lead the
backline and are two of the players
who helped the team cam its hard
nosed image.

"i think we should be able to beat
Brockport.“ said i’agano. “they're
not as strong as they were last
season."

“i expect a very physical game
from them," remarked Nezaj, “they
are not a well skilled team; they‘re
similar to Cortland. only they‘re

I dirty.“

J.V. Gn'ddlers Lose To ithctca

by Bob Bellafiore

in the mud and steady and
sometimes torrential rain. the
Albany State J.V. football team lost
to the ithaca College Bombers 27-”
last Friday at University Field. The
only Dane touchdown was scored

on a 48 yard run by Dave Warhite. ~

Ted Shuitz added a 32 yard field
goal for Albany‘s other points.
“We had a hard time getting our
offense untracked." said head .l.V.
coach Tom Mayer. “We didn‘t
execute." This is the truth. as the
jayvees wishbone attack could only
muster i24 total yards on the ground
(48 on Warhite‘s TD). and a more

_ respectable 106 yards in the air.

ithaca. with its wide open
multiple offense. drcw first blood
after recovering an Albany fumble
on the Dane 30. The Bombers then

marched in. capping the short drive
with a four yard plunge over the left
side. Albany countered with the
boot by Shuitz. making the score 7-

ln the second quarter. a third and
l2 situation forced Albany's
quarterback. Tom Pratt. to throw.
The result was a 58 yard interception
return by an lthaea back. The kick
was good. and the half closed with
lthaca up [4-3.

The Danes returned in the third
quarter and it seemed as if they were
going to take the ball game aWay
from the visitors. After a 25 yard
kickoff return. Warhite took a pitch
from subquartcrback Mike Fiorito
around the left end. and followinga
key block by Mike McGuire. raced
down the sideline for the score. The
two-point conversion was good. and

the jayvees were back in it afterJust

' 32 seconds of the second half i4-ii.

But ithaca pulled away with a
touchdown in the same quarter, and
one more in the fourth. .

Mayer pointed out that the
defense again played well, especially
sophomore linebacker Greg
DiNoto and freshman safety Dave
Hardy. but being on the ﬁeld most of
the time takes its toll on even the
finest of squards. Pratt (2 ofii for 83
yards). Fiorito (2 of 7 for 23 yards)
and Warhite (leading rusher with
four carries. 56 yards) had the best
games offensively.

“We weren‘t emotionally ready."
said Mayer. “We played them very
closely. but not to our ability."

The Danes. now I-2. travel to
nearby Union on Monday and to
Middicbury the following Friday.
