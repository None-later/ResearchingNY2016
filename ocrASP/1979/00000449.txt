Boaters Look To End Tough Week Vs. Brockport

 

Lose Yesterday To Tough Hartwi'ck
After Rallying To Tie Cortland, 2-2

by Mike Dunne

A gallant tie with Cortland State
last weekend coupled with an
"impressive" l-0 defeat at the hands
of soccer powerhouse Hartwick
yesterday has leveled the record of
Albany's soccer team at 2-2-l. and
catapulted several ofthcir upcoming
games into the “must \vin"eategory.
The first such game will be
tomorrow's battle with the visiting
Brockport Golden Eagles.

Playing at Elmore Field on the
Hartwick campus. the Danes
managed to contain the Warriors
during the first half. Hartwick is
currently ranked ninth nationally iii
Division I.

It was not until the 4020| mark of
the second halftliat Warrior striker
Andy Sobolcwski penetrated the
Albany defense to score the only
goal of the match. This wris only the
second time iii seven otttings the
Warriors were Iteld to a siitgle goal.
In fact. their potent offense totaled
eight goals in their last two games.

The Bootcrs nearly came up with
their second dramatic lie within a
week. Fullback Luis Arango.
playing for the first time in two
weeks, hit a sharp header that nearly
bctit Hartwick goalie Aly Anderson.

Last Saturday at Cortland the
Hooters used it rare indirect kick
goal by Alex i’iigano with l2 minutes
remaining in the match to tie
Cortland. The sides then battled
through two scoreless overtime

periods before settling for a 2-2
draw.

The Red Dragons. spurred on by
a home crowd estimated at [500,
dominated the early minutes of the
game. The first seven shots were all
by Cortland. but fortunately
Albany’s injury riddled defensive
corps used a few mispiays to their
advantage to temporarily frustrate
the Dragon offense.

“They could have had two or three
goals early." said Albany soccer
coach Bill Schicffclin. “For a
change. we got lucky."

Albany quickly changed the
momentum in their favor by
converting their first shot into a
goal.

At the 20 minute mark forwards
Vas Scrdsev and John Markcs
worked a give and go play down the
left side. Markcs. a sophomore.
made the final pass setting tip
Scrdscv. who boomed a hard shot
past it stunned Tom Matlavagc. the
Cortland goalkeeper.

“It W'is tin outstanding goal; a
professional shot." said Scliicffclin.

The Dragons used their
considerable height advantage to tie
the game tcn inintitcs later. A steady
diet ofltiglt crossing pt .. slauitchcd
in front of the Albany iict produced
a goal when John Davie controlled a
free brill iii the penalty area and
tucked it in the right hand corner
behind Albany keeper Alhcrto
Giordano.

With the score knotted at H. the
defenses held forth for the
remainder of the first half.

The two sides. both members of
the Eastern Division of the SUNY
Athletic Conference. lived up to the
expectations of an intense attd
evenly played match.

Early in the second half. Cortland
gained the upper hand on a goal by
Tom Case. which put the Dragons in
the letid for the first time. After
moving the ball down the right
sideline they chipped over the Dane
defense to case. who then pushed the
ball past Giordano. Cortland now
owned a letid which seemed safe on
their home field.

The Bootcrs nearly allowed their
hosts to pit! the match out of rciiclt.
With 20 mintttcs left a Red Dragon
forward eluded his defender and
confronted Giordano one on one.
The senior kccpcr charged off his
dovc at the ball managing to deflect
it.

"We were frustrated anil had otir
backs to the wall. but we didn‘t
quit." commcntctl Giordano.

Danes began to force the ball upfield

Halfback Jack Burger’s 128 Yards Key
in Albany’s Third Consecutive Win

by Paul Schwartz

Brockport did it nttmbcr of good
things on Blceker Stadium's shabby
football field last Saturday night.
They ran off l9 more plays than the
Albany State offense. and they held
the Danes to a mere 56 passing
yards. while the Eagle quarterbacks
managed over three times that total.

Still. Brockport was routed.

The Eagles also did a number of
btid things. They set the tone for the
evening by fumbling on their ﬁrst
play of their first offensive series.
which also happened to be the
game's first play.and then things got
worse. The Danes scored in every
quarter. lcd l7-0 at halftime.
incrcitscd their lead to Jl-9 and
ultimately whipped Biockport. 38-6.

“We played ait excellent football
game." said Albany head football
coach Bob Ford. “It was inspired
football. I was pleased With our
point productiott. We‘re not doing
everything we want to do, but
overall. we played very well."

As in the Danes first two victories.
the defense refused to give much
ground. The Eagle's six points were
the first allowed by the Albany
defensive unit. and that touchdown
came after ll consecutive shutout.

quarters. And those points should
not have scored. A Brockport pttnt
was fumbled by Albany's Bob
Easter. giving the Eagles posscsion
on the Danc‘s lit yard line early in
the final quarter. leading to
Brockport's lone score.

But it was the Dane offense that
established itself as a unit that can
score in bunches. and taking center
stage was halfback .lack Burger. it
was Burger who also set a tone of
sorts when. on Albany‘s first play
front scrimmage. he took a Terry
Walsh pitch and promptly gained 16
yards. The play was called back
because of ti penalty. but the impact
remained. In tiillyiiig 128 yards on
only eight carries. Burger was
involved in two touchdowns. one
with his legs. the other with his arms.

Ahead 3-0 by way of a 34 yard
Dario Arango field goal. the Danes
were pinned back on their 19 yard
line early in the second quarter by
punter-quarterback Scott Zttlin's
corner-ﬁnding kick. From there.
Burger went to work. He took a

“The hole was therc.“said Burger.
“The offensive line was the story.

Everything camc easier to the whole

And what about the high-step?

Call For Complete Nuke Phase-Out

by Charles Bell

Activist Toni Hayden and actress
Jane Fonda brought their
Campaign for Economic Demo-
cracy (CED) to Albany Friday.
stressing the importance of a
government that would increase
controls on the nation‘s energy
resources.

l-layden. addressing a group in it
Capitol meeting room. stated that
the energy industry. a “slow
stumbling dinosaur mired. in the
vested interests of the past." is
deepening the nation‘s cncrgytcrisis
by buying up competing alternate
energy forms.

"We propose ti phase-out of
nuclear power as soon as it is
economically feasible.“ said
Hayden.

He suggested energy conservation
and investment iii wind.
hydroelectric. and solar powers.
Fonda added that public
representatives sitting on corporate
boards could Itavc ait itnpact on
changing the nation's energy fixture.

The controversial pair made their
Albany appearance as part of a toiir
of sortie 55 American cities. which

included a stop at the Love Canal
toxic chemical dump site in Niagara
Falls. Fonda said that the dumping
ofchemicals at the site has produced
one of the most "devastating"ltcalth
problems in years.

“I felt at Love Canal the way I felt
in some of the bombed partsvof
North Vietnam." Fonda said. She
added that she supported a piece of
legislation sponsored by Senator
John Daly (R-otl) rind Assembly-
man Murphy (R-IRQ) which would
enable Love Canal homeowners to
sell their property to New York
State at a fair market price.

The CED is a California-based
movement which Fonda described
as a "state-wide grass-roots political
organi/atioit with a core of
aetitists.“ She 'allcd the pair's
efforts an attempt to hook up with
local groups sharing similar
interests. rather than building a
national organiration.

Fonda said California CED
candidates have motintcd election
campaigns on platforms of housing
improvement. rent relief.

development of solar power and the
cleanup of toxic duuip sites like

Love Canal. She added that CED
candidates have won l7 elections in
California.

Both Htiydcn and Fonda
compared the CED movement with
the mass movements of the l960‘s.
claiming that contemporary
progressive issues can attract a
broader constituency than the issttes
of the last decade were able to.

"There is now illl objective
reality." said Fonda. "that we 'an
btiild a huge alliance that brings its
beyond the politics of protest.“

Hayden said that the current
belief that the nation‘s political
mood is moving to the rigltt is
misleading and that the right wing
ltas used gimmicks and threats to
create the illusion of strength.

Fonda claims that goternment
acts stich as the California
legislature‘s recent refusal to
confirm her appoiittiiient to the
California Arts Council helped to
convince people that the country is
ttirning to the political right,

The result. she said. is that the
myth of the nation's political mood
becomes ti "sell-l ullilliug prophecy."
