“What's so important here is the

Albany described what usually
happens in a family which passes the
breast cancer gene from mother to
daughter to granddaughter.

“Each generation. these daughters
get born. While they‘re still
teenagers“. they watch their mothers
die of breast cancer. 'I‘Iieu they get
married. haye their own families and
die of breast cancer when they're .15.

" l'he key is notjust identifying the
patient \\it|r cancer btit identifying
their families." Alhaiio said.

“More vigilance is indicated.

physicians and more meticulous

Researchers are also looking
beyond family histories. trying to
identify chemicals in families with
the etiiicerrearrying genes.

With those chemicals insulated.
they say. persons destined to
develop cancer cart be identified
