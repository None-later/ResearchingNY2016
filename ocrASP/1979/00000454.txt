The magalinc rcports th t
professors. anti deans of universities
arotmd the US. are beginning to
give lower grades as a reaction to

sixties and CSPL ally in the early
I970‘s. professors had a tendency to
grade easier because of the draft.

BOOTLEGGERS!

Iranians have reportedly resorted
to what you might call a type of
bootlcgging in efforts to quench
their thirst for alcohol. whose sale
was banned by the Iranian
government six months ago.

According to the Iranian
newspaper Bonn/ml. soles of raw
alcohol in chemist shops have
skyrocketed over the past few wceks
attd barrels of industrial alcohol are
reportedly being sold in poorer
suburbs of ‘l‘cltran.

The newspaper says that one type
of illcgal alcohol is even being

.has been studying improvements in
medicine since the l900's.

Dr. Wesley Spink says that back
in the good old days. in I900.
children had about a 50-50 chance of
living until the age of IO, and adults
livcd until about the age of 42.
instead of the current average of 70
years today.

Dr. Spink credits preventitivc
medicine. bcttcr drinking water,
better working conditions. good
nutrition and better sewage for the
fact that some people who wcrcalivc
during the early l900's are still
around today to reminisce about tltc
"good old days."

N0 BEEFS!
lnllution may be ugly. but the
average worker still toils less time to
bring home the bacon . . . cr. . .
hamburger.

According to Labor Department
statistics. U.S. manufacturing
production workers earned an
average of $3.24 an hour. including
overtime. It took a worker l3
minutes to earn enough to buy a
pound ot'grottnd hccl'. then priced at
on average of about (in cents.

In I978. production workers
earned an average of 56. IO an hour.
and ground beef cost on average of
$l.l I a potntd. meaning that despite
soaring tncat prices. it took less time

It minutes to "carn"a pound
ol’ hamburger tltan it did nine years
earlier.

ALCOHOL AIDS

Wiuc connoisseurs have been
saying all along that drinking wine
with your meals aids digestion. Now
rescarchci's at the University ul
California at lIci'kclcy say thcy cart

l'ltc researchers say they
conducted a 75-day study with six
healthy men. Fitch day a subject
would think one liter of California
red table wine. a liter of de-
alcoholi/cd Iinlandel. or just plain

the researchers say they found
