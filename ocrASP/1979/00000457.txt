by Harold Diamond

Saturday proved to be an
excellent day for the Albany State
men‘s cross country teams. The
varsity squad defeated Colgate 23-
32 on. a breezy. sunny afternoon.
The junior varsity team tied Colgate
28-28. but lost to Mohawk Valley
Iii-40. Cross Country coach lloh
Munsey named ismacl Cruz and
Mike Sayers Cit-Runners ot' the
Meet.

Cruz ran a smart race on the S.|5
mile course. His strategy was to run
til a brisk steady pace. This should
have beeti a difﬁcult task (fire to the

spring past two potential Colgate
scorers. George King and Dave
Nicholson.

Scott James finished seventh and
Crur placed ninth at 28:20. He
attributes his fine din to u Colgate
fraternity house. He heard them
playing Rocky ditring the last half
mile. A final burst of speed enabled
him to edge out his nearest
opponent. King. by two seconds.

maintain his teammate‘s lightning
speed. Russo finished at 27:08. This
wasjust two seconds slower than Bill
Mathis‘s winning time of 27:06.

Munscy was delighted about the
decisive victory. He had expected a
closer match. Munsey remembers
