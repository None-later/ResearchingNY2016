The Albany State varsity baseball
team met an unbeaten Cortland
team. and the Danes were just
ovcrmntcltcd-losing both ends of a
doubleheader on Sunday. Albany
baseball coach Rich Skccl was
frustrated at the ineffectiveness of
his pitching staff: “We did‘t have a
single pitcher who could stop them.
We're avcraging nine runs a game
and we‘re getting beat.“ The dual

loss droppcd Albany‘s overall‘

record to 3~(I and to 24 within thcir
divisiott.

The first game was sloppin
played. with Cortland swamping the
Danes lu-‘i. Cortland took an early
lead off Albany starter Mikc
(‘Iahcaux with a six run outburst iii
the first inning. (‘lahcaux lasted two
innings. going up eight runs. (iat'y
|.c(‘ontorc came out of the bullpen
and did twice as wul|--taking l‘our
innings to givc up his cight runs.

Albany did manage to keep lltL'
game closc wltcn they strtick for six
runs in the third. Francis Rivcra
started things off with a doublc and
crosscd ovcr to third on Matt
‘Analck's base hit. Brucc Rowlands
scorctl hint Wllll tI singlc and Tony
Moscltclla ltlilthtI lltc hascs with It
surprise hunt hit. Rob A rcnriodrovc

 

in Antalek with a sacriﬁce fly and
Bob Rhodes walked to ﬁll the bases

_again. Gary McCarthy followed

with a two run single. but Rhodes
was thrown out at third in a close
play. Rich Cardillo stroked a
boonting double to drive in
McCarthy and then scored on
Rivera‘s sccond hit of the inning to
cap off the Albany scoring. and
trimming tltc Red Dragon's lead to
one. 21-7.

The illusion ofcloscncss was short

r . ‘ .
hvcd. as ( ortland came up With two

more runs iii the top of the fourth-
without tltc benefit of a hit. The
Dragons took advantage of three
Albany errors and two |.cContuic
wild pitcltcs to take command oftltc
gamc once more. "We kept letting
the cat out of the bag." lamcntcd
.Skccl. "We set the game back 25
years, It was embarrassing. Wc
tnadc II crrors~not including the
mental L‘l rot's‘." ('orllnnd went on to
sum thrcc more In the fifth and 3 iii
the scwnth. wltilc Albany managed
to scratch otIt just ottc hit in lltc last
'l'oIIr innings.
lltc sccotttl game was much hcllcr
played, thIt was lost in a dramatic
lttsltion. 9-K. Mikc Fsposito startcd
I'or Albany but lastctl only 2 U] in-
nings. mainly because he was gctting

A Batman-Experience Pitching Woes

gthc ball up and the Cortland hitters

g were spraying extra base hits to all

ﬁelds. Cortland got a run in the ﬁrst
on a long double and two long
sacriﬁce flies. Albany charged back
in the bottort half. of the inning on
three walks and a Moschclla grand
slam home run to deep left ﬁeld.

Cortland then pecked away at the
Albany lead with two runs in the
second and surged ahead with three
more in the third and one in the
fourth. Albany tied it up witha three
run rally in tltc bottom ofthe fourth
with key hits by Rowlands. Arcario
and Rhodes. but Cortland camc
rigltt back with two in the top ofthc
fifth.

With darkness approaching. the
Danes htd one final chance to pull it
out. Rivcra grounded out. but
Antalck powcrcd a long home run to
rigltt field to bring them within one.
Rowlttnds flied out. but Arcario
kcpt tltcm alive with a single and
Rhodes walked. bringing up tltc
offcnsc hero. Moscltclla. He
responded to the pressure by tugging
a sinking linc drive to right center
field. The Cortland right fielder
made :I dcspcration dive and
grabbed Ihc hall just ol'ftlttr grass to
sttvc the game. “It was a super
catclt...hc caught it clean."
