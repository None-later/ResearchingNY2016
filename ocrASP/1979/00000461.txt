Jack Siedlecki was talking about
his favorite subject. Without
hesitation. he began explaining the
defense. Every part of it. The
nuances. the techniques. the
philosophy behind his Albany State
defense. And as he spoke. he
constantly downplayed his
importance in the success story.

But Sicdlecki's words eventually
belied his modesty. Through his
analytic view of defensive football.
Siedlecki simply confronts the
problem at hand. and using his vast
technical knowledge. he arrives at a
solution that should work. And it
almost always does. Albany's Head
coach. Bob Ford. has called the
football field “a life-size
chessboard.“ If so, for defense.
Siedlecki is a grandmaster.

This season. his moves ltave been
ﬂawless. The Danes have allowed a
mere six points in their first three
contests. and the defense ran tip it
string of II consecutive slitttout
quarters before llrockport linrtlly
managed to score. Opponents have
found moderate success throwing
the ball on Albany. btit against the

run. the Ditties have been
immovable.
As the l)ane‘s defensive

coordinator. Siedlecki is the main
cog in it large wheel. The dclensivc

 

staff consists of John Kt‘alovie.
Kevin Callahan. llartk Hughes. and
Mike Welsh. and each coach works
with a dilfcr'ciit defensive positioti.
Siedlecki coaches the inside
linebackers. but the task that
distinguishes hint is that he calls till
the defensive plays during a
ballgrirne.

“l enjoy calling the plays.“ said
Siedlecki iii an interview on l'riday.
“I enjoy the pressure ol it. and that‘s
what to make
dccisiotisttndct pressure. lt‘s casyto
Inake tlictri when you're
winning."

Despite the ob\rotrs importance
of play-calling during a game.
Siedlecki secs another aspect litt'
tttore critical. ||c approaches it
fanatical state when it comes to
preparation. the tttctttttl approach
to football fascinates liitti. ()Ii

we‘re here Ioi

defensive stalt' devi. a gantcplan.
utililing conrputct'i/ed scouting data
to learn etery ol't'eiisite tendency of
Albany's next
Monday. the coaches give the word
to the players.

For Siedlecki. it
represents a challenge. If he cart
choreograph his player‘s trimemcirts'
to counteract the opposition.
Siedlecki feels his defense is
prepared. Perhaps the greatest
example of this is last year's game

 

“We have to get good
athletes who will work
like hell to become
better, and that's what

we’ve done, and

Sunday nights. Siedlecki and theI

opponent. 0n.

gatticpla ri -

 

with Ithaca. lt wasa crucial game for
the Dane's playoff hopes. and
Siedlecki readied his troops for the
Ithaca offensive juggernaut in
spectacular fashion.

“The things we look at is - - what
are their strengths." explained
Siedlecki. “Then you have to be able
to evaluate yourself -— what are our
strengths. what are our weaknesses.
Then. to defend people. you httve to
decide how much you‘ve got to give
up ~A how much gambling you have
to do to stop them. Against some
teams. we can sit in our base (4-4)
defense all day long. and they won't
move the ball against its because
they aren‘t good enough to do it.

“A team like Ithaca. they‘re going
to move the football ifyou sit in your

 

defense. there‘s no question.
I licy“te got a good offense a mi good
people. The thing you hate to be
able to etaltiate is how far do you
stretch yourself. How mnclttto you
hate to gamble and still be able to
win the game. We gambled it lol
against ltliaca last year. We came
with it lot ot stunts. attacked certain
things. 'lheir quarterback was t
great ritnner. brtt he could not pitch
the ball worth it damn. We came
after the quarterback forced him
to pitch the ball. arid he threw three
pitches away that night. and we
recovered two of them. He couldn‘t
tltrow the ball real well they
weren't a passing team. so we played
nine people up front our black
coverage, so we were in a 4—5-2. It's

 

really playing games with people
and seeing if they can pick up your
stunts.

“You have to evaluate what is
going to be effective. We knew the
roll-stunt was going to be effective
for us in that bullgame. We knew if
we came down and pressured that
quarterback A »- if we could execute
the stunt properly and get down
there and put pressure on. that he
would have problems. And he did.
He had tremendous problems. We
knew he couldn't throw the ball real
well so we took advantage of that by
bringing an extra guy up to defend
the option on the outside."

Even the ﬁnest gameplan can be
thwarted if it is not executed
properly. Here is where five days of

practice conic Ill. The doctritie that
Siedlecki arid the staff devised is
ingrained irtto the players" minds.
l’hc junior \arsity squad becomes a
"look" learn. taking on the
Iormation of the l)anc‘.s nest
opponent. and the lessons. sltttyly
and painfully. arc learned.
"During the neck. tie do
recognition drills. and problems nill
come up. l‘hcy’ll go iti motion. and
tte are iii something. and tte‘ll say
'look. tie can't do thitt.’ We irate to
iron these things out before we get
into a hallganie. so that yoti don‘t
hate players standing otrt there \tith
question marks in their minds
during a game. 'l‘liat‘s a eoacliesjob
a teacher ttho is trying to
eliminate arty questions or

skepticism on the player's part. as
far as we want that player to believe
in what we're doing. and have the
confidence in what we‘re doing. so
he‘s just going to go. because he
knows we‘re right. And it‘s
confidence in the coaching staff
more than anything. confidence that
we‘re making the right decisions."

The Danes line up in a 4-4
defensive setup. a formation they
have used for the team's 10-year
existence. This goes hand in band
with the entire football philosophy
at Albany. “We use it basically
because of the kids we recruit."
Siedlecki said. “lfyou take a look at
our schedule. we play a lot of
physical education schools. and they
get more pure athletes than we get.

 
  

We get a smaller brand of kid. The J-
4 is geared to protecting the people
who are standing tip. the otily ttto
big people or: need (In! the too
deleiisite tackles. Other than that.
our ends and outside linebackers are
.ill the same type good athletes
who are irr the linebacker category.
We irate to get good athletes ttlio
\\i|| tiork like hell to become better.
and that's ttliat we're done. tllltl
\te'te been successful."

It‘s no surprise that the Ill-tear-
old Siedlecki has been successful.
His background is filled with the
traditional markings excellence
in athletics. :. sports-triirided family
 yet there is something more. Et en
a grandmaster must work at his

craft.
Siedlecki um an outstanding

athlete. At .lohnstown High School
he captained the football.
basketball. and baseball learns. and
predictably. was offered athletic
scholarships to a number ofcollcges.
His father wanted him to go Ivy
League. Harvard perhaps. and
Siedlecki himself realired he was not
big enough for big—time Division I
footbtill. so as a sort ofcompromise.
he chose Union College. a school
with a rcptitation for losing many
football games.

"Union was a very poor football
school." remembers Siedlecki.
“They were nowhere near as serious
as other schools. 'l'heyjust aren‘t as
competitive. They played sonic good
football schools. htit they‘re geared
ntorc to the private. academic
institutions that also play
intercollegiate sports."

This did not strit Siedlecki at all.
After spending a year at Union.
where he played both ways
linebacker and running back. it was
tiriie to move on. “I wasn't happy
there. I felt there wasn‘t really tery
rnnch competition athletically." he

| Miami of Ohio was
Sicdleeki's next stop. Football wasa
challenge again. He took on a new
position. monsterbaek. and a new
major. pltys ed. biit suddenly a new
problem arose. “There wasn’t any
challenge academically." Siedlecki
said. "It was ajoke. I had about it 15
com. and I didn't do anything."

After dropping out of school lor'a
year. Siedlecki rtiadea few decisions.
He would go back to Union. He
would play football at Union. And
maybe tor the first time. he would
play football simply because he
enjoyed it. "I did \tell :rczrdctiitcally.
and I played a lot of ltitithttii. I
played both ways and enjoyed ll. i
didn't need tiic competititcricss of
l)i\ision I. At l'riioti. we were 54
one ycirrand 4-5 ariotlict year. which
are too of the better records they "\c
had iii the last l5 y'ctrrs. Hill I
enjoyed it. I ttas enjoying playing
college football. I returned krcksatid
krckot'fs and played linebacker and
i'tiiitringback. l'hcrc ttcrc about
tlii‘cc id as tilio played both ways.
and it \tas fun."

Siedlecki got a taste of coaching
\tliilc still at l'riion. During the
summer. he tyorkctl as the head
coach for the (iloie (‘ity Colonials.
it semi-pro team in .lobnstoitn. lint
this was not his ﬁrst taste. He had
been around coaches for his entire
life. both art the tield and in his own
home.
