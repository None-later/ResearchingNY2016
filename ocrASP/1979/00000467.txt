The Editor’s-Aspect ‘ ‘ l'

1979

' A Lead
Pipe (inch

It would be great stuff to be Cary Grant. To be sleek,
and refined, and cool. To play a sharp hand or two of
Blackjack at the tables in Monte Carlo and walk away
with a few hundred grand jtngllng in a Tux pocket; and to.
drive off in. an emerald green Mazurati with Grace Kelley.
It would be terrific ’ to handle things; problems,
homework, love affairs, angst. But life isn’t like that. Luck
isn't that willing to serve our desires. So we cheat. We’re
playing against the house odds as it is, and if we have to
mark the cards a bit to gamble on getting some small hap-
piness, well, what of it. Besides, it’s a lead pipe cinch that
in the end the house is going to wln. So we cheat. We
capture a little part of Monte Carlo when we go to the
track and lay down a bet. It's exciting. The action. the
danger of losing. The kick when you win. The risk!
Whether the wheel spins in the Casino Royale or the
basement of Temple Beth Sholom on Nostrand Avenue
the thrill ,s the same - and where it stops nobody knows.
So we cheat, and light a cigarette, and wink at the fat little
cabbage that's become Grace Kelley for the night because
she’s female and she's willing.

And when the going get’s tough the tough get going,
etcetera “And when the homework brings you down
we'll throw it on the fire and" take the magic bus
downtown to pillpopper's paradise - the non—materialistic
egg world of kandy kolors and pie in the sky lunacy.
Drugs. Voices coming out of floating crystals - being suck-
ed into clouds by nightmavens and airwielders. Paranoia-
schizophrenia on the [RT to oblivion. Anyplace but here. |

So we cheat, and watch T.V. which is the same thing
without the risk. But in this week’s stories on Tripping and
Gambling etcetera. it is, for those that do, the risk that is,
