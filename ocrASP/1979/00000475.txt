Exceptionally cold weather. a

varsity debut —— one may expect that
a young player. especially a pitcher
would falter urtder such adverse
conditions. However. when Albttnv
State baseball coaelt Rick Skeel
called upon freshmen .lack Tierney
to trike the mound Wednesday
afternoon against Sienrt College. the
young leftltander pitched nine
innings ofexcellent baseball. despite
the-eventual 7-4 loss irt the tenth

after the game. "I “stated to throw a

The Danes battled throughout the

double smacked by Bruce

third baseman Bobby Area rio belted
a twovrun ltomcr to tie the game.
Afterwards. Arcario said. "I wasn't
thinking homer. but he took
something off the fastball and I felt
it."

Arcario also plttyed a fine
defensive third base. making a

spectacular catch in the top of the

seventh.

Another tine catch was turned in
by centerficlder Matt Artlalek.
According to Skeel. Altalck isone ol'

Danes' potential is immeasurable.
Skeel commented. “They know
they‘re a good ball club and now
Albany is building that kind of
reputation around the league. The
team‘s victories are no'longcr just
miracles.“

Such a splendid appearance
provides Skeci with optimism
towards the future. “This team is
gellingand they‘re hungry for wins."
said Skeet. Certainly.'this game and
the double—header sweep against
Ilinghamton that preceded it will
attest to that fact.
