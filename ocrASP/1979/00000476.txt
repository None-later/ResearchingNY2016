In the window of Barnes and
, Noble in New York City isadisplay 5

featuring the top sports books and  

novels for sale today. in the middle
of the display sits a book which
surely catches the eye of any New
York sports buff. Titled "This Date
in New York Yankee History“. it
proclaims that it will take you from
the beginning ofthis bail club to the
I978 championship year.

Upon closer examination inside
the bookstore. the author dedicates
the book to ten people and "the
dorens of others who made Albany
State the best 4 years of my life."

That is the same line Nathan'
Salarit used in his farewell column as
sports editor for the Albany Sttrdcrit
l’ress three and a Italf ycrirs ago.
Salant Iias written and compiled a
veritable bible for New York Yankee
baseball fans. The book features a
day-hy-day history of the Yankcss
from [903 to I978 and just abotit
everything rind every record a
Yankee fan would want to know.
One can find features such as every
trade the Yankees ever made.
nicknames of Yankee players. men
wlro only played one ganie as a
Yankee. the ballparks the Yankees
played in and even tips on how to get
good seats to a game and how to
obtain autographs front ballplayers.

Most ofthe book is statistical and
some of the writing could use a little
tightening. brrt in the era of energy
crises. Salarit has created enough
fuel to keep hot stove leagues burning
lor many a baseball off season.

Along with Carl Wolfson. art
Albany State freshman who worked
as his research assistant. Salaiit
scoured the archives ot Yankee
Stadium and the liaseball Mttscum
in ('oopcr'stouu to collie tip with
ama/irig tidbits of
information. including a few
photographs of a |‘)0tl spring
training which the llascbrrll Museum

didn‘t even know it had.

Salatrt returned to Albain State a
few weeks ago and participated in

lie-was here attending a varsity

Before his assasination, San

his wish for a national march
on Washington to demand civil

appeared to be knee high. “Bali!”
repeated the ump. "There. that
pitch!" Salnnt shouted. pointing.

"‘That pitch was a strike. but hejtrst
wasn't in good position to see it.
That shouldn‘t be. It can make a
difference in the game."

Nathan Salant then talked about
Nathan Salant, obvidusly one of his
favorite subjects.

“When I was here, l was at every
single soccer game from |972 to
i976. except for two. and that was
when I had pntieniotiiu. I saw every
basketball home game when school
was in session. and every home
football game when there wasn‘t a
soccer game."

In addition to being sports editor
of the 4 l SI'. Salant was president of
AMIA. a Central (‘uuneii member
and did play—hy-piay ol the New
York islander home games on the
campus radio station, 'I’lrosc vvcre
the days when going I’M was an
unlikely dream. arid a carrier-
cttrrcrit station called WSllA served
as this school's broadcast medium.

“That must‘ve been the only
_carrier current station to carry
major league sports." Salarit was
told.

“We were the first college radio
station iii the nation to broadcast
major league sports." he corrected.

The broadcasts vtcrc set tip by
Salunt. who wrote the islanders a
letter and pushed for the rights: Ills
plriy-by«play broadcasts included
the semi~finriis of the Stanley Cup
games.

Albany State sports were his main
interest here. however. Asa (‘erttral

he said.

After graduating iti I970. Salarit
went on the Boston Univcristy l aw
School. where he continued his
sports writing and broadcasting.

While in Boston, he earncacrossa
book titled “This Date in Red Sox
History." With a life long yearning

the Yankees. Salant wrote the
publisher a letter. He told them that
he would like to do a hook on the

Red Sort rivalry, the fiercest in
American sports. A letter came
back from the publisher. Stein and

Yankees. however. they
wanted it in mtrcli the same style as
the Red Sox book. Salant had to
prove two things to them: that he
cotrid write and that he knew people
in the yarikee organilation.

A tenure as a reporter Llll the
Rock/(Ind Journal News took care
of the first stipulation. The second
was born out of an iii-fated attempt
to watch a doubleheader at Yankee

Before a small crowd of loyal fans
Iasr Tuesday night} the Albany State
women's volleyball team took the
court against a rather mediocre
group from New I'rrltz State.

After five grueling games. the
borne town favorites pulled away
with a 3-2 games clinch of the
contest. _

The first contest began with the
Albany women jumping to a 5—0
lead. The Dune Spikcrs showed
some litre perforrtranccs in setting tip
the brill to the front ofthc net so the
middle hitters could get maximum
velocity on their Irits.

Starters for the Danes are

freshmen Katia Netto arid Lisa

Diehi. sophomores Reba Millerattd
Jylie Menoff. junior Anne (‘arberry
and senior captain. Allison Heals.

the Albany squad mounted a
balanced rittack with Heals at the
helm. setting up hits. time and time
again. to 5‘I0“ middle hittier Diehl.
whose hitting was tremendous.

Combining on the win was Netto‘s
serving and Reba Miller‘s serving
the last four points for the win.
Netto has it most unusual serve in
vvltlcli she serves the ball with her
brick to the net. bringing her right
arm around her body. giving the brill

net.

Subsequently. the Danes won the
