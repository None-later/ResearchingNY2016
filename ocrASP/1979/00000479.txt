TlJUANA, Mexico (AP) An
autopsy will be performed in
Mexico on the body of Chad Green
to determine how the 3—year-old
leukemia victim died. a lawyer for
the boy's parents said Monday.

Attorney William Ginsberg told
reporters the autopsy will be done in
Tijuana by doctors from Mexico
and front the San Diego County
Coroner‘s office. just north of this
bor'dcr city.

He said the autopsy may be
completed by Tuesday and Chad‘s
body then will be taken to his
birthplace. Hastings. Ncb.. for
burial.

Chad. who was undergoing
treatment for his cancer at it Ltrctrilc
clinic Ircre. died Friday.

"Ilontc recording simply cannot be

,Thc parents. Gerald and Diana
Green, fled Massachusetts last
January. in deﬁance of a court
order. to seek Lactrilc treatments ——
treatments that are not generally
available in the United States.

Ginsberg said he advised the
Greensto return to Massachusetts
after the boy's funeral and “face
whatever charges are pending." The
Greens are facing a contempt
citation.

A Massachusetts state senator
introduced it non-binding resolution
in the Legislature on Monday.
urging the court to grant the Greens
temporary amnesty.

The parents attended the news
conference but on their lawyer's
advice would not discuss their plans.

Earlier. Ginsberg said the parents
'originally wanted to return the boy‘s
body to California so that doctors
tttcrc icould perform the autopsy.
The lawyer had sought the necessary
approval for the transfer front Gov.
Edmund G. Brown. Jr.

Drown. however. was in
Massachusetts seeking support for
ltis possible presidential campaign.

Chad. a blond. hlrrc-cycd
youngster. and his parents arrived

Massachusetts court ordcrs that
prohibited the rrsc of Lactrilc for the
treatment of his leukemia.
