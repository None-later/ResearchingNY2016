l-R-S T AXED

The Wall Street Journal reports
that the Internal Revenue Service
has come up with a way to get
potentially delinquent taxpayers to
pay their taxes on time: it's doubling
the penalty fee.

The Jourqu says that for tire past
two years. the late charge on
delinquent taxes has been ottly six
percent of the total taxes due. Now.
however. the I.R.S. has decided to
double the penalty payment to I2
percent of the taxes due.

According to The Journal.
otcrpaying taxes might not bea bad
idea for taxpayers. The newspaper
says that the l.R.S.. while charging
[2 percent on late taxes. will also
have to pay 12 percent interest on
certain refunds. including those that
result when taxpayers overpay and
later file amended returns for
refunds.

campaign aimed at lttring potential

Christians to “Campus Crusade For
Christ" lectures.

George Hermanson. Chaplain of
the University of British Columbia‘s
Cooperative Campus Ministry.
claims that the “Campus Crusade
For Christ“ has been distributing
"misleading" handbills advertising
only one of its lectures. That lecture
was titled “Dynamic Sex —-- What Is

Hcrmanson complains that other
lectures such as "Was JcSus God"
and "The Resurrection" have
deliberately not been mentioned in
any advertising for tile lecture series.

A DIFFERENT KIND

OF DOOR

A Lincoln. Nebraska. landlord is
being sued by a woman who alleges
that he installed a pccpholc in the
ceiling of a newly consuucted
shower in her apartment.

The woman‘s lawsuit describes
the pcepholc as being of the “type
most commonly found in the front
door of residences which
magniﬁes the view for the viewer."

The lawsuit says that when the«
woman phoned the landlord about
her discovery. he "laughed
uproariously . . . and found the
entire incident to be extremely
humorous." The shower is below an
upstairs apartment rented by the
landlord's brother and roommates.

The suit asks for a month‘s rent.
attorney's fees and unspecified
general damages for the anguish the
woman says she suffered after she
discovered the peepholc.

THE AMERICAN WAY

Japanese drinkers are reportedly
gi\ ing up sake for beer and whiskey .
according to Nao/o Montoi. a

Montoi says that as more and

whiskey and beer.

Momoi says that just in the last

Japan have increased by three and
seven percent respectively. \\lti|c
sake sales have dropped by six
percent.

Says Momoi. “The Japanese
