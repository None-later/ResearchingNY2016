‘ I . v.. ‘ Wow
First the good new.. The Truth in Testing

Act will become law in New York State on

January I. I980.

Now the bad news: The standardived
testing industry is demttnding a retest.

After an intensive lobbying campaign for
the bill by student. consumer and educator
groups that was crtppcd off by Governor
('arey‘s signature in mid-July. representatives
of the nation's l25 tncdical schools and (ill
dental scltools ltave annourtced that they will
stop administering medical and dental school
admission tests in New York when tlte law
takes effect.

in addition. offi "'tls of Princeton‘s
"dueational Testing Service (li'l'S). the
'tiggest test-maker in tltc country. have
claimed tltat extra research reqttired by tlte
new law will lead to price increases of more
tltan 50 percent for New York ltigh scltool
seniors plannittg to take its Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SA'I ). 'l ltcy have also wartted
that tlte frequency of makeup test days and
spCClﬂl testing sessions for the handicapped
may be ctrt as a resttlt of tlte law.

'l lte bill. which passed the State Senate and
Assembly by surprisingly wide margins this
year. rcqttircs testing corporations to ntake
ptrhlic tttost of tltcir test questions and
answers 30 days after the test results are
teleascd. Students wlto so request ettn get
.upies of their own answer slteets.

it also requires testing companies to make
ptthltc all studies and data relating to their
t'.'sls and to supply prospective test-takers
with much tnore detailed information abottt
tlre purposes and uses of the tests than they
now do.

The testntakers. who fougltt the bill down
to the wire. contend that ottce they tttake the
tests pttblic itt one state. they‘ll ltave to tttake
'hem pttblic in all states. Attd once they do
Ihat. they cotttitttre. they‘ll have to develop
'tL'W tests. which takes more tintc attd tnottey.

llte testing industry argues that there are a

ntite number of test questions. l)r. .lolttt

"ooper. president of the Association of

  

. . . w
i ‘A L Medical Colleges. said. "There isa‘
lirttit to the number of relevattt questions that
can be ttscd in the Medical College Admission

Test (MCAT)."

These arguments failed to persuade the
governor. who. in a ntcmorattdttm released
after he signed the bill. praised its
requirements as “a reasonable exercise of the
State‘s regulatory responsibility in the field of
education." Nor do they hold much weigltt
with Steve Solomon. who has directed
NYl’lRfi‘s Truth in 'l'esting drive for the past
two years.

Solomon termed the testing industry
arguments "era/y." He said he had checked
with test experts around the courttry and “it is
ittst ttot true" that new test questions are as
hard to cotttc by as the test-makers say they
ilfC.

Solotnrrn also ridiculed ETS officials‘
assertions tltat they would ltavc to raise the
SAT fee from $ll.25 to Sillll) per student to
cover additional costs. "i feel the figure is
definitely inflated." he said. contending that
the companies spend about 5 percent of their
budgets a year on test development while
earning 2’! to 27 percettt profits.

“Atty extra costs." Solomon said. “could be
absorbed by the companies‘ pure prolit
tttargms.“

   

  

 
  
 

 

 

To the Editor: I
I am a freshman attending the State
University. residing in State Quad. On Friday.
October 5. at 2:55. i went to pick up my mail. I
found that i had a notice informing me that I
had a package waiting to be picked up. As i
did not have my ll)card with me.attd noticing
that it was near to flzfll). I went to the door to
see ifthcy would tnake an exception. I did not
expect them to give ttte my package without
proper identification: however. because it was
not yet lzlltl. i wanted them to know that I
would be bttck shortly. attd if they could wait
attotlter rttitttttc before closing for the
weekend.
Not only did they deny my request. bttt I
found the girl that answered the door to be
very rttde artd indignant. | informed ltertltat it
was not yet 3:00: according to her watch. it
was 3:03! She informed toe that they were
finished for the day attd I would have to wait
ttntil Monday to pick up ttty package.

Over tltc Weekend. i talked with ttty parents.
who had settt ottt the package from
llrockport. New York. on 'l'uesday. Oct. 2.
The package ltad been sent from lakeside
Memorial Hospital in llrockport. attd was
stamped Priority Mail.

Today. I returned to tltc Quad Mailrttottt to
finally receive my lottg anticipated package. I
found myself facing a closed door. As 1 grilled
my teeth. clenched my ll) attd my pick—up
notice. and noticed it was 2:30. I knocked on
the door. only to get the response. “What do
yott want?“ I calmly explained that there
would be no mail! At this point. being
extremely angry. I explaitted that my package
was Priority Mail from a hospital. Without
fttrtlter question. i got my package.

I atn very disappointed with the way
Priority Mail is handled here. | feel that this
package should never have left the tnaitt Post
Office on Campus. and that i should ltave
received a phone call infornting Inc of an

 

Solomon. who the recent public
announcements by the testing companies as a
political ploy to weaken the law before it takes
effect. also labeled as “era/y" the advice given
by State liducation Commissioner (iordon
Autbaelt to New York students who want to
apply to tnedical atttl dental schools. Asked
what he would tell these students to do if the
tests for these schools wure no longer offered

itt New York. Atnbaclt. who opposed the bill.
said. " l'ravel outside tlte state to take the
tests."

talking about ltow "outrageous" this threat by
the testing industry is.

by Representative Ted Weiss(I)-Manhattan).
He called the passage of the New York bill "a
great victory for students. parents. educators.
and consumers.“

The law also won praise from Ralph Nader.
Nader. one of the first major critics of the
Sltlntlilt'dlICLl testing industry. called the new
law a “turning point itv the ttational campaign
to subject the testing industry to public
scrutiny. ETS lvas been judging the worth of
.stttdents for years. Now the students are
getting a chance to judge the worth of ETS.“

More Nukes

To the Editor:

I found the pro-nuke letter itt last 'l'uesday's
paper very alarming! llowsomeone camjump
to the conclusion that without nuclear pttwer
we will latte to resort to child labor. live in
small apartments. attd surrender ottr freedom
to the So\iet Union is not cotnprehendable to
ttte. There were no facts presented to illttstrate
the writer‘s viewpoint.

The Soviet Union‘s oil situation is nttt as
bad as ottrs because they don‘t use as mtteb oil.
We use utore than we need. We are one of the
largest oil prodttcittg nations: maybe we
should export less. 'I here is no need todepend
on the Soviet Union for oil.

l.et's look at the lJ.S. governntcnt here, 'I he
people itt Seabrook attd surrounding towns
voted down the building of a nuclear site at
Seabrook. It was built anyway. The people ttf
Seabrook voted dowtt the transportation of
nuclear waste tltrottgh the ar‘a. It is being
transported through their towns. That‘s
democracy'.’

The development of nuclea r power without
extensive research ittto safety measures attd
waste disposal cottld be the worst mistake ever
tnadc itt the history of the world. If the
ittcidcttt at lbrec Mile Island wasn‘t brought
ttndcr control. the wltole state of
Pennsylvania and more could hove been
exposed to high levels of radiation. Radiation
causes cancer. This has been pruven. Tim.“
are statistics. As it happened at Three Mile
lslattd. everybody within a hundred miles was
evacuated tttttil the airclcared. But the air isn't
clear. l'lutoninm stays arottttd for half a
million y‘ars. The air travels. 'I hose
radioactive particles cotnc down with the rain.
Who knows where‘.’ Stronsinm. pltttonitlnt.
ttnd other radioactive elentettts accumulate itt
the botte marrow. causing changes iii the
cellular structure. The tnore one is expose- to
radiation. the more likely one is to get cancer.
This also will effect one‘s offspring. The curve
continues to rise. livery year tnore people get
cancer. The best care fot'cancer is to eliminate
as many 'attscs as possible. Nuclear power ts
one cause that catt be eliminated. There atr
alternatives.

There are many ways to implement solar
energy: windmills on tlte coast. downlnll
flowing water. tides. dams. attd ocean thermal

 
 

 

 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

energy conversion (OTEC) are just a few.
OTEC involves the exchange ofcold water on
the bottom of the ocean with warm water on
the top. The energy is transported by
hardwire. The cold water is replenished by ice
caps. the warm by the sun. Solar energy is
transmitted with silicone wafers attd with a
solar roof. Any building can be heated. Solar
energy eatt be stored.

Kelp grows one to to it feel a day and decays
ittto methane. natural gas. Refined. it will rttn
‘ttrs.

We cannot deplete the sun. Uranium. used
in nuclear reactors. cannot be tettsed.

I believe it‘s very important to get people
thinking about what ttnelear t'adioaetiv ity'can
dc to their owtt bodies: not to mention the
effects on future generations.

Nukes And Violence

Since my return front Scabrook. N.ll. last

This. to the. is the gist of the problem rigltt
here. Those people wlto criticize the

Getting Gissen

 

Did you ever st0p and think about how much of UAS's food is wasted? How much is
:crvcd. not eaten. and then conveyor belted into the kitchen for garbaging? An awful
0L

O Currently. there are two popular methods of food programs in college use. The ﬁrst
is the one in use at SUNYA today. The other method involves coupons. Students '
purchase coupon booklets with a certain amount ofdollar food value. Each item eaten
is priced and paid for with the appropriate coupons. The student can still eat as much
as he or she wants. only this way. it will cost.

And what a difference that will make. No longer will students arbitrarily take
second and third belpings of things that never reach the palate. Food won‘t get tossed
around as much citltcr. that would become an expensive prank.

Overall. less food would be ttscd. better food could be bought. more variety would
be insttred.

The bottom line is this. Two thirds of the UAS Board of Directors is comprised of -
students. As the policy making body of llAS. that puts usin control. Therefore.whcn
students constantly assault UAS food with a barrage ofinsults. they are overlooking
the fact that they til“ at l‘ast partly to blatttc.

We control this board. so let‘s retake it! Why should students be forced to be on a
meal plan if they don‘t want to'.’ Why d ocs an ittcrediblc amount of food go to waste?
Wlty are tlterc so many complaints about food quality? Wlty‘.’

Stop asking these questions attd act on tltctn. Find ottt who the members of the
Board are. and tell them what you feel.

It‘s time llAS‘s food service stopped being wasteful. and unresponsive to the needs
attd wants oftlte student population. if the cttrrent system is not working. and it isn‘t.
then it‘s time to change. to look into alternatives such as the coupon system.

We're paying for meals even if we don't want to. attd we‘rc tltrowingaway a lot of
money itt wasted goods. Stop complaining. start acting. It‘s ottr lJAS. it‘s time to
retake it!
