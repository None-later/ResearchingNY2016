lrnprovéd lwomen’s Soccer
Team Downs Skidmore, 2-1

by Susan Milligttn

A tremendously improved
Albany State women‘s soccer team
updated their'record to 3-3-l after
beating Skidmore 2—1 at home last
Saturday. .

“i can‘t stress enough how much
the team has improved.“ said
Albany women‘s soccewr coach
Amy Kidder. “Last year. we lost
every single game and scored only
two goals all season. Tlris year. we

are 3-3-l; and have so far scored 12
goals_compared to our opponents‘
five goals." _

The team is very young; last year
was the ﬁrst year that the Albany
State soccer women played at a club
level. The team this year consists of
mainly freshmen and sophomores.
and includes five returning players.

Leadins with goal credits so far
are sophomore Sue Stern with three
goals. freshman Gina soitlo with

three goals, freshman Heather
Turner with two goals, sophomore
Cherrice Buel with three goals. and
junior co-captain cheryl Chittppone
with one goal. Sophomore Laurie
Briggs was injured at “Colgate. but
.has returned as goalie to make 24
saves for Albany.

The Albany women started the
season with a tieagainst Coigateand
a 2-l loss to i-lartwiek. The team
since then has had three straight
wins inelttding a 3-] win o\er
Hurtwick.

“We‘re very excited about the
marked improvement in the learn."
said Kidder. “Next year. we will be
excellent."

Albany's women‘s cross country

the Capital District meet last
Saturday. but this was not the sole
reason for their win.

"lfyou took the placements oftlrc

the placements ol the top five

“it's a very tough course."

of the other schools that will be

it will be respectable.“

Danes Show Consistent Offense In 40-12 Victory

t'mr/inut'tlfmm page xix/cm

The Bull offense was hampered
sotncwhal by lheahscncc ol split end
Gary Qttatrani. a spccdstcr who
suffered a knee injury in Buffalo‘s
previous game. Brtl .lirn Rotlrigue/
was in uniform. and the statistically
impressive quarterback was
hounded by the Danes at every ttrrn.
Albany defensive end lirie
Singlclary stormed iii to sack
Rodrigucl three times. and when
Rodrigue/ ditl gcl tltc ball off. the
results were mainly unproductitc.
Netting only two passing yards in
the second halfand (ti for the game.
Rodrigth was limited to eight
completions in El attempts. in
addition. the ro\ing Dunc
secondary. led by Ilaynot‘s two
interceptions. picked ofl tourcrranl
losses.

"Rodriguc/ wasn't up to par."

- he (Rodriguez)

said Dtmdm “i didn't ktrow it. btrt
during the game he hurt hislhumb.i
was wondering why he was hanging
the hall when he llrrcw it."

“We thought they would try to
establish the run. btrt we knew
basically they were a passing team.“
said Singlctary. “And we knew that
had done well
passing. bill that the real test would
be against its. anti we shot tltctn
down. The defense got oil the bull
teal first. before the oflcnsiyc litre
cotrltl set up. and I think that took
sorttc confidence .away‘ lrotrr the
quarterback."

In holding the littlls to a mere |7l
total yards. the Albany defense. as
lltcy ha\c all season. performed well
enough tor a shutout. “i don‘t think
they would |ra\c scored on our
delcnse il wc hadn't giycn them the

bull itt good scoring position."

commented Ford. Certainly, the
Bttlis would not have scored their
lone tottclrdown if the Danes had
not handed Buffalo the most golden
ol opportunities. A lottrtlt quarter
pitch from l~'iorito to Burger was
mishandled. artti Buffalo's John
White recovered tltc brill on the
Albany one-yard line. On the next
play. llrc littils capped the shortest
driyc on record one yard - as
l\lrricr plunged in for tire score.

In all. it was tltc undefeated Danes
most complete \ ictory oftlte season.
and undoubtedly the offcnsc's most
wcll-rotrntlcti gurnc. Soott Albany‘s
\L‘llt‘tllllt‘ starts entering its rough
portiort.»arrd with an olfcnsc that
always pttl qttick points on tltc
board. and now is scoring with
consistcnt tlt'iycs. tltc Danes seem to
he peaking at iust thc rigltl time.
