give the public‘an adequate picture
of the energy problem.

The public does not blame me
situation on the government or on
OPEC nations. but on "big oil". he
told The Associated Press
Managing Editors convention here.

“It‘s difficttlt for the nation to
come tip with ttii energy policy when
cicryoiie is going in different
directions." he said.

t')‘l.etiry told the next spapct

ckcctitiics that although ciet‘yotic in
Washington is tulkirigabout making
the United States independent
through its own energy production.
that actually “the rcttl policy oi
goicriintctit is to import oil." Ilc
citetl stcady increases ol imported
oil in recent )cars in his staicriicnt.
()‘l eary predicted st-icir
economic problems \iill result Iroiii
thc way the gowriiniciil is handling
the energy situation.
One problem. he said. is ihc
decision by utility tid\iscis not to
recommend construction ot
additional nuclear plants.

In addition. ll states elect
iiiciiibcrs ol their public sciiicc

iiiuiiissioiis "and they are not

Illly to support it platform to raise

itcs." he said.

Kitlicll said ll the public can bc
coiiirccd that till energy crisis could
suddenly dciclop. "then may bc we‘ll
be ttblc to ltltll\L‘ an impression on
Washington that the best solution is
not in the direction we're headed,
illitl tlncctioii is tighch controls.
.rddcil ta.\cs on oil coiiiptitiies and
more bureaucracy. which all
iiilcilcic \\Illl the forces of all Il‘cc

"My point is that lootl is basic
iiccd httt there is no control oicr
what it pound til liiitiiburgei can
cost. he said. “Housing is a basic
ticcd...but tlicrc is no control o\ci
