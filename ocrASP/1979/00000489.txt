3”“ Springsteen Sued

.
Singer Bruce Springsteen may be
sued by one of his women friends as
a result of a bizarre incident during
the recent anti-nuclear benefit con-
certs in New York City.

Photographer Lynn Goldsmith
claims that Springsteen roughed her
up and publicly humiliated her
when she attended one of the fund-
tatstng events.

She contends that the singer spot-
ted her in the audience, approached
her and dragged her to the stage.’
Springsteen is then said to have an-
nounced to the audience: “This is
my cx-girlfriend."

The photographer says she was
then dragged backstage where she
claims she was “verbally abused"
by members of Springsteen's road
crew.

Fortunately for Goldnismith, a
movie-maker is reported to have

captured the entire incident - from
beginning to end - on ﬁlm. She says
she is currently considering the lil-
ing of a $35 million suit against Spr-
ingsteen, a decision she says she will
make after conferring with her
lawyers.

Immediately after his name

ed he wanted his new name to ap-

produclng imported waters may ac-

The New York Pats! reports that
the New York State Health Depart-
ment has Instructed “Apolllnaris”
of West Germany, and “Vichy
Celestin" of France to put warning
labels on their bottles because both
brands contain possibly harmful
levels of arsenic.

According to the newspaper,
Celestin was found to have an
arsenic level of .24 parts per
million, while Appolinaris had .05
parts per million - the maximum
level allowed by the Federal
Government.

The Health Department cautions
that long-term use of the arsenic-
laccd water could be dangerous.

Cheech is Changed

Tommy Chong of the comedy
team Cbeccii and Chong found
Iiiinsclf reliving one of his early
comedy routines recently.

Otie of Cliecclt and Chong's
earlier routines featured an overly
aggressive panhandler. Last Satur-
day, Cltong and his wife were ap-
proached by a member of the Hari
Kristina 5ch at the Los Angclcs Air-
port and asked for a donation.

When the comic refused to
donate, the Hari Krishna member
reportedly pushed Chong against
the wall and repeatedly hit and
kicked him.

A US Customs officer who
witnessed the attack turned the
overly zealous panhandler over to
the Los Angeles Police, who book-
ed him on charges of battery.

Cltong was reportedly not
seriously injured in the incident.
