The Editor’s Aspect

Television is a concept by which we measure our pain.
it creates a mythology of heroes and morality based
solely on commercial viability. it’s only purpose is to
attract us to it like a whore, and it’s trick is to give as little
as possible for as much as it can get. But it’s worse than
that. Television addicts us to its superficial fantasies —
lurid appeals to our worst instincts for the easy
gratification of our desires — and the price we pay is
freedom. it’s not just the commercials, which are vapid,
mindless exploitations that work like brainwashing;
simple statements continuously repeated. Even more'
dangerous are the shows themselves. Most television
shows subliminally affect us, molding our opinions and
values by creating phony ideal families and people and
situations which are totally beyond reality. Yet, because
television is always there and on six or seven hours a day,
we are constantly exposed to it and therefore, by sheer
exposure, we easily mistake the materialistic values it
presents as reality.

There’s good reason for television to want us to be
materialistic. They want us to buy the products they
zealously hawk. Millions are devoted each year toward
figuring out ways to entice us to buy Brand X. If that
much was spent on presenting, quality, intelligent
programming, television might be something more
genuinely useful than the wasteland it is.

television could be fun. it could be good and

entertaining at the same time. it could be an art instead of
the audio-visual billboard it is.

the door of our own cell or look into another’s
