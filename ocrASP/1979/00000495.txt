The
Evening

real is purely intentional.
"Picture this." gnarled Eb. “Men and
women are all over the place. eyeing the guts

but they can sure lie down. He‘ll lie on top of
her. she'll heave under him. He'll come; she'll
fake it. and they'll both have a tinge oidisgust.
a lrint of regret in the morning. Picture that."

Eb was trying to pick tip a girl in Bogart‘s.
Eb was trying a new approach.

"if you don't believe me. then just look
around you. it'll happen here tonight. maybe
right now with ‘Farne' blasting. or between
burgers and fries at the grill. it's the same in all
these college towns. as far as lcan see. Man is
a soulful creature. but he also has one hell of
a tendency to pop an erection at the slightest
instigation."

His approach clicked.

"1 see what you mean." she said.

Eb felt tickled. if she was wearing strange
clothes. maybe it was because everything else
was dirty. And girls with freaky clothes had
freaky personalities and were 'r into
naturalness. and sex is natural. Eb felt not the
least bit slighted.

“ll 1 knew your name." he ventured. half~
heartedly. hall-assed. “i could communicate
with you. Things could flow."

"Right." she said. "Flo."

"Yeah." he snorted. because he thought

 

 

 

 

he'd been beat. She was repeating the last
word of his sentence. and that meant she was
either burnt. or maybe just very tired.

"Are you tired?" he asked.

"Why do you ask?" she said.

"i said so because you repeated the last
word of my sentence."

Eb felt the lights dimming. in a bar, the
lights are always dim. he thought. and now he
knew why. Real communication was the only
thing they worked against at a bar. Loud
music for the ears. No lights for the eyes.
Crowds. so touch ends up not meaning a
damn thing. and liquor. so taste is horrible.
The smell is body odor.

"My name is Flo." she corrected him.

"The last word in my sentence bad beeii
flow." he discovered the pun.

“Well. l'm Eb. and as Springsteen might
have said. l'm ‘lost in the flood.‘ Let's leave
this joint and smoke one instead. Do you feel
like it?"

They escaped through the front door. and
waltzed out of Bogart's with she leading. The
lights were too dim for lib.

Allow me a minute of pure regression. Eb
and Flo are students of the world. They get
up they get down, they've gone in the out
door. and they won't get fooled again. You
could say they've done it all. but they haven't
done a damn thing all the night long. Eb is
admittedly lazy, but he has a great deal of
confidence in himself, and Flo knew that he
was just kissing ass in his own sweet way for

some head on that first night. She didn't mind.
She wanted cock bird.

Flo grabbed sonicone's beer off a sticky
' table while its owner was pissing off the last
one.

"Let him drink what he's pissng and share
the wealth." yelled Flo as a quick. lottd
justification iii the wake of some dirty looks.

Eb hadn't the security for dirty looks. and
besides, Flo had stolen the fuckitig drink.
Jesus. he thought. what one has to do to get
laid these days. what one has to do.

They were outside now. it was sharp and
focused. and * the words went like darts
through the night air. The smoke here was

in the brush the heavy hot air burnt llth
nostrils with every breath. Steam seeped
through huge green leaves. The air choked
him. as he dragged himself through a shroud
of heat. The incessant potindings he heard
came from his heart . every muscle sagged like
lead strapped to his bones. and mosquitoes
nested in the open pores of his skin. His
clothes consumed his sweat and a slimy veil of
moisture and dirt ooyed over his body. He
smelt like dead fish. bill be kept going. Large
scarred hands wretched with the anguish and
passion of a thousand hunts. gripped the old
rifle steadily as he stalked over thick brush.
Night came and with it an ominous silence
in the jungle. The air was slightly thinner but
he was too obsessed. too exhausted to
notice. He kept moving. sucking on
scrounged-for roots and insects as be hunted.
For endless days and nights he tracked his
prey through rough terrain and insufferable
heat. and he hadn't slept during any of it. He
kept on. All is quiet in the jungle at night but
there is no peace. in the darkness lurked
death. each step brought him closer. Soon. he
thought: he'd find it soon. Or it would find
him. And their it was daylight again and the
atmosphere bung heavier than ever before.
His boots snapped the dried branches
underfoot. Large leaves smacked his face as
he squirmed and plorlded into the thicket. Yet
somehow. despite the pain. despite the weary
legs and squinting eyes. despite the hunger.
the thirst. and the heat of Northern lndia in
summer. a thrilling tide of passion rushed into
his every muscle. pumped through his
pounding heart. The taste of dirt filled his
mouth. He grinderl it in his teeth. crushing it
and swallowing it down. Close to death he felt
most alive. Life surrounded him. The trees.
the birds. the insects. the clouds and.
somewhere behind a bush or on a ledge or

frost. I

"Let's hitch to Manhattan. l've got access
to an apartment there." Eb felt satisfied. He
tirade his pitch.

Flo was depressed. The beer was gone. and
all she was getting was New York City and
cock.

"Got any drugs or dope?" she asked.

Eb thought quick and told her they'd get it
off the street people in Washington Square
Park.

“l've got friends down there." .

They walked. The Thruway seemed like
miles away. but Flo reminded hiin of the joint.
and they smoked together and becatne
friends in a car on the way down.

"Eb." Flo asked. "Are we ever sure we're
doing the right thing?"

“if we are," slicked lib. "then we can't be
right."

His pun pleased him. but he actuall
believed in what he had said. He sincerelt
believed he'belicverl it.

The pot and half of llt'l' beer had made liirri
iecl ftrririy. like he always feels every day and
night after pot and '1.0 ounces of beer. if he
shook his head too hard. it hurt like a
headache. and it always secured like a
fabricated paiti that wouldn‘t be there if he
stayed straight.

had shot her. winging her on the shoulder
with two rounds of shrapnel and fire while she
bathed unknowineg iii a cool stream. But she
didn't die and so the hunt went on. Man

He found a splotch of red on a leaf. The
wound had opened again. Dried red stains of
blood splattered the leaves in a path heading
towards a clearing. He stayed low to the
ground. advancing carefully. He couldn't be
sure of his eyes anymore. They made
everything seem blurry. The heat affected his

and it threw Eb for a loop. He hadn’t expectedl
heavy handed bullshit philosophy in some
pervert's car on the way to some shithole in
Manhattan where he would fuck the
nightlights out of her.

But then he mellowed and told her the side
effects would be a son or a daughter.

She pretended she was not amused, but
she had really liked that pun. This guy Eb was
straight forward. even though he was trying
everything to be as curved as a Polish straight
line.

They were quiet for a while as the sign said
'New York 30 miles.‘ The other signs said that
everything would be cool and they would be
okay. but both of them were too nervous to
realize that. Both were too hyped to practice
naturalness. to rehearse authenticity. to be
real.

"You cant let us out at the next exit." Flo
broke the silence.

'F.b was stunned because this wasn't New
York City. and apparently. he no longer had
to think of an excuse for not having an
apartment to crash at down there. He hadn't
expected her to say yes. actually.

They were in the middle of nowhere. Ell
looked around benignly. arid nialignaiitly

What puts Apocalypse Now above so many
other films is its willingness to accept
ambiguity. ambivalence. and the absence of a
clear-cut right or wrong. ‘

The film is a work of art. the like of which is
seldom seen in this country or anywhere.
Dramatically excellent. it is also visually
unique. employing use of color and depth in a
way that is truly startling. lt's stark violence
will repel some. and its depth and intensity
may not please those who might prefer a
Charles Bronson shoot-'em‘up. Nonetheless.
it is one of the few must-see films inagenerally

disappointing year. Those Hollywood cynics
and back-stabbers who had hoped or
expected to see Francis Coppola fall on his
face after the staggering critical and»
commercial success of his God/other iiltns
will be disappointed. Apocalypse Now is a
stunning achievement: a great film and a hell
of a good movie. —

and the drums of Mr. Bun E. Carlos. There is
also an occasional welcome lead gultar solo by
Nielsen. who is especially effective on
"Voices" and “Writtng on the Wall." Despite
his rather insane demeanor. Nielsen is quite a
capable gultarlst and shows htst talent well on

this album.

The hand does sbrne experimenting by use
of two Instruments which. for them. are quite
unusual. Nielsen plays a "mandocello" (a
cross between a mondolln and a cello?) on
several cuts. and session musician .lat Winding
plays organ. The combination of the two pro-
duces a sound similar to that of a synthesized
string section. This makes for a very interesting
effect which works well on "Dream Police". A
surrealistic rnood ls created which provides a
perfgct background to the song. which deals
with the extstence of an tmagtnary police
force. '

After the tremendous success of Cheap
Trick at Bukokun. it would have been very
easy for the band to stack oil by releasing a less

than quality album. Theycould probably have
coasted on the popularity of the last release.
but they didn't. instead. they have put out all
thctr efforts and have gtven us tlrelr best studlo

plant Cheap Trick firmly Into the ioundatton of
