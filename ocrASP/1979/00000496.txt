cess - both at the departmental level, and as
members of the Senate committee. in this
capacity. students must balance the many

' criteria established for making a decision in

order to cast a vote which reﬂects the in-
terests of the student body.

One criterion which is used in order to
make a decision regarding tenure involves the
“program priorities" of this University - that
is, a determination is made regarding tltc
1 need for the candidate (for tenure or promo—
tion) with regard to the overall needs of the
department and the University. This criterion
. is certainly applied by the President, who
makes the final decision; and up to now has
also been a consideration of those groups

t (which contain students as members) ‘ -iich

make recommendations to the President.
’ However, at thc last Senate meeting
(l0-l5-79), a proposal was introduced to
direct thosc advisory committees no! to cott-
. dcr the University‘s Program Priorities
witcn m'dtyi‘. g tltcir rccornmcndtttiort. This
would. in turn, mean that tltc Prcsidcnt tI/Ullt'
would consider Program Priorities, rviIImul
any common! uImu/ lIlt‘llif/‘UIII IIIt‘ft/t'Il/It' or
slur/mil Imrlvv.I That is, stndcnr and faculty
concerns and opinions about pt'ogt’nrtt
prit tics. cspccirtlly with rcspcct to tcntrr‘c
dct‘lstons, would rtot bc hcartl.

lltc [act in itsclt' docs not bothcr trtc all
that much - such proposals can bc dctctrtcd in
tltc Scrrutc. \y'lrut docs bothcr Inc is tlrc fact
that most student Senators initially votcd in
favor of :hc prr 'nili! Studcnrs lurvc csscrr‘
tially votcd I'.II to bc heard. lczm‘t hpr but
think that tltosc wlro voted in this way trrc no!
rcprcscrttirrg tltc best interests of their consti-
tuency. the student body.

Final action on this proposal has bccrt
delayed. l'lowcvcr, tltc issue of tenure
gttidclincs will continue to be a topic of
discussion for the Senate — itt fact, it will con-
tinuc to be discussed at tltc Scnatc meeting on
Monday, October 22. l sincerely hope that
ill": members of thc'studcnt body here will
contact their Senate representatives and de-
mand that they consider carefully tltc im-
plications of the vote they may be called
upon to cast. Much ltas been written on these
pages in the past few weeks regarding the im-
potcncc of student government - don't let
your rcprcsunttttivcs votc away tltc rights and
privclcgcs which you do hach

On Basic Rights

To tltc Edltor:

i am a student at SUNYA but lcannor tell
you my name, my department, whether i run
an undergraduate or graduate, or evcn it‘l am
male or female. If i did anything that would
lead to my identity being found out, i would
lose my job with the school, lose my scholar-
ship, and lose my chance at a quality educa-
tion. 1 am bright, vcry talented, and extreme-
ly articulate - bttt 1 ant forced to be silent on
this campus because my rights are not pro—
tccted as it gay person.

i would be subject to harassment in tire
dorms (yes, we are irt your dorms) and ccn-
sure in my unnamed department if it were
kttown l believed that tltc fact of your loving
is more important titan tltc sex of who you
love. I am oppressed because I believe loving
is more important titan gcndcr.

President ()'l.cary has the opportunity to
include sexual preference irt tltc anti-
tliscriminatiou policy govcrttirtg this school -
thereby establishing a precedent that would,
perhaps, be casily followed by other state
schools. He will ttot ttppr'ovc such an addi-
tiort. How many gricfs and pcrsonal disasters
ttmong faculty, staff. and students will it take
before it is rccognilctl that l otrt of every 4
families htts til least one guy pcrson'.’ How
many families are represented at this school?
(The statistics are in our favor).

Many of SUNYA's most talented tllltl uc-
tivc people, who happen to bc guy. urc suf-
fering in agonizing silcncc out ot‘ fear for

their positions and educations. We do not ex-

pect our women and black population to suf-

bians? ‘

l long to be able to sign my name to this
and am angry because i can’t. At the Gay-
Lcsbian March last Sunday, l was a
PERSON- here (according to officials
sources) I don't even exist. By putting my
name to this I would be fired and-or suspend-
cd or pressured until i quit on my own. If
that happens (as it still might) it would be
SUNYA's loss more than mine.

To the Editor:

l havc a complaint about tltc rudc students
on this campus. 1 am a SUNYA student and
also work in onc of tltc administrative offices
as ti sccrctttry.

lt's cxtrcmcly frustrating to answer a
phone only to be forced to dcal with abtrsc
and rtrdc language from complaining
studcnts. l rculizc that sometimes it's hard to
control onc's tcmpcr, cspccially il~ you have a
legitimate problem, but wiry not try and ex-
pt'css that angcr to tltc person in charge, not
to the one who unswcrs tltc phone!!!

It may ttltlkc you feel bcttcr to be able to
dump on sonicbody, but I huvc to be polite to
everyone r'cgardlcss ol~ how impolite you
choose to bc - and yotr don't rnttkc my job
arty casicr.

The reason l'or an cducation is to teach it
person to be u prot'cssioual (supposedly); so
why rtot start now by practicing on tltc staff
of this University. instead of incurring tltcir
rcscnttncnt, you'll probably get their help
and sympathy.

Guns. Guns. Guns. Who the hell cares about guns anyway? The Constitution gives
everyone the right to bear arms. so what’s all the fuss about? [fa gun was made, then a

gun was meant to be share”, so why all the ado about Security having them?

Mistakes? We all make mistakes, but we‘ll show those crooks, even if it means
knocking ofl'rt few people who happen to be innocent. Besides, as long as it isn't me

by socking someone in tltejaw. or punchinga whole through some glass, or tearing off

the wallpaper? These things happen. That's why we have renovation. right?

twice about it. But it docs make for some great news.
