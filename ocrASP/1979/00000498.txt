 

Davis Inducted Into Football Hall Of Fame

SYRACUSE. N.Y. (Al’) Twenty
years ago, Ernie Davis was one of
the most exciting college football
players in the country as he led
Syracuse University through ii_n
undefeated season and ti national
championship.

Davis became the ﬁrst black to be
recog'niled as the nation's
outstanding college Football player
wlten be won the Heisman Trophy
two years later.

But it all ended there. Davis
played in one post-season till-star
came after his Heisman Trophy
vear; but. weakened by lettkeniia.|ie
iiever played professional football.

 

Two years after he had run for823
yards in his senior season at
Syracuse. Ernie Davis was dead.

Davis will be inducted ittto the
foothill] Hall of Fame during a
special ceremony at half-time of
Saturday's l‘eiiit State-Syracuse
gaittc played in the New Jersey
Meadowlands.

lien Schwartlwalder. who
coached Davis at Syracuse. will be
there. along with Jim Brown. who
played at Syracuse before David
arrived on campus. and who would
have been his teitnitiiate on the
Cleveland Browns. the National
l‘ootball team that drafted Davis.

   
  

Floyd Little will be there. and so
will Ernie Davis‘ mother. Marie
Fleming.

Although l0 years have passed
since the speedy ruttiiing back died.
Schwartzwaidcr still has trouble
talking about Davis.

“l have to be careful when I talk
about it." Schwartzwaldcr said of
Davis‘ deatlt. “lf l don't watch
myself. l...|t still bothers me."

Scliwartlwalder said he was
sitting in Chicago‘s Soldier Field
waiting to‘ watch the |‘)(i2 All-Star
gillllC~\Vllcll it was announced the
game ball would be awarded to
Davis. although he wouldn‘t be

playing in the game. >

“That's when I realized something
was wrong. I said to my wife. ‘Gce.
Ernie's got to be dying' for them to
give the game ball to a player
who wasn't even going to be iii the
game.“ I

“If there ever wasa great person. It
was Ernie Davis. llis kindness.
thouglitftillttcss. enthusiasm. all
separated hint front even real nice
people. He was just an exceptional
person. He liltetl the wltolc team.“
said Schwart/walder.

“’lhc only problem | ltad with
lirnie \vas gettiitg him off the
practice licld. 'lhe grotintlskccpcrs
were always begging me to get him

 

_ off the field so they could turnTlie

lights off. He was always looking for
an excuse to practice. Now. a coach
is lucky if he can get ltis players to
practice."

“There weren‘t many faster
football players. Hc‘had an instinct
for daylight. like all tlte great backs
do.“ recalled Schwartzwalder. who
coached Syracuse University teams
for a quarter century until he
returned iii 1973. compiling it IS]-
9l-3 record.

Ernie Davis was one of the few
players to wear the coveted Syracuse
University jersey No, 44. which was
also worn by .liiii Brown and Floyd
Little.

Although Syracuse running back
has averaged more yards per ca try in
his career than l)iivis'(i.(i yard. . and
his 2.704 career yards rushing rank
him third iii Syracuse lllsltll').

NBC And Marv Albert For Fight

(AP) There will be another
heavyweight championship fight of
halfthe world Saturday. but this one
ltas some major differences.

it will be on NBC: it won‘t be on
prime time. and the lite telecast will
be preceded by a show exploring
whether the network should carry
lllL‘ tight at all,

In addition. this World Boxing
Association title botit will match
two fighters black Ainciicaii
John late and white South Alrican
(ierrie Coet/cc who hate iictcr
worit the |tca\ywcighi crown. A
sports stori with news Inertottcs.
the figltt will be held in Sotitli Africa.
It nation blacklisted lll parts ol tltc
world beeatise of its apartheid
policies.

And from a television perspective.
the fight will be interesting because it
will be handled by a new voice for
national audiences and boxing r
Marv Albert a native New Yorker
who bricks ti trend in broadcasting
because ltc doesn't sound like he
comes from Omaha. Neb.

This is a critical assignment loi
Albert. priniaril) a local broadcasth
who has been critici/ctl for not being
a hard-nosed journalist and not
tackling eoiiti'twersial issues and
personalities.

While Albeit has broadcast
cotiittlcss games in\ol\iiig the New
\ork Ktiicks and the New \‘Iiik
Rangers on local 'l'\' and radio. he
has only doiie ti eotiple of non-title
lights ltll‘ NBC. along with the usual

 

amateur fisticiil'fs that break out iii
hockey games.

"This will definitely be my biggest
broadcast audience.“ said Albert
before leaving Wednesday for the
tight lll l’retoria. “but you could
ps)cltc yourself otit il'yoii think that
too much."

Albert was picked because of his
\oicc enthusiasm. a quality NliC
hopes will help hype a light that
didn't capture the fancy or finances
of the l‘\’ networks. All three turned
down the figltt its ti prime-time
package. NliC Sports was in hour
of this fight pltis it welterweight

ABC. CBS and NBC all
considered Tate-Coetzec as an
afternoon attraction. and NBC won
the rights for 5400.000 ——
approximately one-eighth of what
ABC paid for last month‘s Friday
niigltt card that included the World
Boxing Council heavyweight
championship between Larry
llolnies and litirnie Shavers

AliC turned it down because of
two concerns. according to Jim
Spence. vice president of ABC
Sports "location iti light ol'Soulh
Africa‘s apartheid policy and

ﬁnancial." Spence said ABC' was
offered the ﬁght for earlier in
October when the baseball playoffs-
were on NBC. This strong 'l'V
competition against the light was the
reason ABC thought promoter Hob
Arunt's asking price of$400.000 was
too high.

Spence said ABC had strong
reservations against doing a light
from South Africa but never came to
a final decision. “We never had to
face that question. It never got that
for because oftlte financial aspects."
lte said. “But we did express otir
concern to Arum."
