clinched the title on the eve of his
mother‘s funeral in his hometown of
New Castle. Pa.

“it's a great feeling to have gotten
the job done,“ said Tanner. who
chose to sip a cup ofbccr ratherthan
drink champagne after Pittsburgh ‘
beat Baltimore Orioles 4-l.

On Sunday morning in
Pittsburgh. Tanner learned that his
mother. Anne. had died at a hospital
in Greenville. Pa.. where she had
been undergoing treatment
following a stroke. Tanner planned
to attend the funeral today in New
Casdtle'

“The funeral is tomorrow. I'll get
to it but now I‘m happy." he said.

“I really believe that when
somebody up there started to help
"the Family.‘ we started to get the
breaks. Danny Murtaugh and
Clentente must be having a ball up
there right now."

Murtaugh. the late Pirate

- manager. and Roberto Clemente.
the late Pirate right lielder. helped
Pittsburgh to a string of division
titles.

'l'amtcr. Murtaugh‘s successor.
had guided the Pirate to a pair of
runner-up finishes in the National
League liast, He also guided
(‘lticagn to second place in the
American I caguc West in W72. and
his Oakland team had placed second
itt I970. 'l his is his first year at the
top.

"l'ie had a lot ol'higthrills. but I'd
haw to call this my most satisfying.“
said 'lannct. “ho was born on the
Fourth ol‘.|u|y attd smacked a home
