Gertie Coetzee Wants Title
’ ’Not “White Hope.” Label

JOHANNESBURG’. SOUTH
AFRICA (AP) Gcrrie Coetzcc of
South Africa doesn‘t want to be
known as a white hope. but just a
ﬁghter who wants to be a world
champion.

“Being called ‘Grcat White Hopc‘
means -more money for me." said
Coetlee. who will ﬁght American
black John Tate tomorrow for the
World Boxing Association
heavyweight title.

“But I don‘t really like it.“tlie 24-
year-old Coetzce said Wednesday. I
want white people. brown people.
black people to accept me as their
cltanininn "

So Coetzee promised that if he
beats Tate and becomes the first
white man to win a heavyweight title
sitice lngcmar .Iohansson in l95‘)
that he will work for full racial
equality in all South African sports.

"One has only to look at what
Muhammad Ali achieved for liis
religion by using the world title as a
platform.“ said (‘oet/ce. “It is
possibly the best platform in the
world to launch such a message."

The fight. which has been
protested agaitist by [1.8. civil rights
groups because of South Africa's

apartheid policy. will be staged
before ati integrated audience at the
I.oftiis Versfeld rugby stadium iii the
capital of Pretoria 30 miles front
here.

'i ieket prices ritii from about SW15
to about $l2. A crowd of at least
70.000 is expected by the promoters
for the built that will be seen live in
the llnited States on Nll(‘ at 4:30
p.m. EDT.

The WIiA title became meant
when Ali retired earlier this year.

The World Boxing (‘onncil
recognizes Larry Holmes as
champion and most busing

observers considei llolnics the best
heavyweight iii the world.
"liyery day when I get tip to train
I think abottt people in the boxing
\orld not havingaceepted inc. and it
ioti\atcs me." he said.
Ilie 34-year-old from Knouillc.
tcnn.. wants a crack at Holmes and

universal championship recogni-
tion, but he‘s not looking past
Saturday.

I‘m just an old country boy and
I‘ve been taught to cross one bridge
at u timc."he said. "I haven‘t beaten
G'crrie yet. When I do. then I‘ll talk
about Holmes."

Tate earned his title shot by
stopping South ASfrican Kallie
Knoetze in eight rounds last .lunc 2.
But he said he has not been lulled
into a false sense of security by the
victory.

“They‘re two different kind of
fighters." said ’l'atc. “Kallie likes to
take you out with one punch. (ierrie
is the type of guy who likes to box.
He can‘t take you out with either
hand but he‘s a boxer. I‘ve trained
for IS rounds.“

('oet/ee. also 24. agrees that he‘s a
boxer with a punch but expects the

fight to go the distance.

Both men are unbeaten us pros.
Tate has won l9 ﬁghts. with to
knockouts. Coetzce has knocked
outilZ of his 22 victims. earning his
title bid with a'onc-round knockout
of former champion Leon Spinks
last June 24.

Dealing With The Media

.
TULSA. OKLAHOMA (AP)
Former professional football coach
l-lank Strum says he had a simple ‘
philosophy in counseling his players
on how to deal with the media.

“We always told my athletes to
think before they talk.“ said Strain.
former coach of the Kansas City
Chiefs and New Orleans Saints. and
now CBS sports commentator and
newspaper columnist.

Strum pitrticipatcd in a panel
discussion on freedom of,
information in sports at the
Associated Press Managing Editors
convention here Wednesday
afternoon.

Also on the panel were l€ddie
(‘rowdcr. athletic director at the
University of Colorado: Hale Irwin.
US. Open champion. and George
Steinbrenner. owner of the New
York Yankees.

Steinbrenner told the editors
acknowledging the hot dog
reputation of his star outfielder.

“But Reggie does his job for
baseball more titan the player who
runs into the traiiier‘s room. slams
the door and won‘t talk.“
Steinbrenner added.

“Hale Irwin has to worry about
his back swing. Eddie (‘rowder has
to worry about the alumni. Ilunk
Strum has to worry about his
Nielsen ratings." Steinbrenner said.
“All I got to worry about are Billy
(Yanks Manager liilly Martin) and
Reggie.“

Americans of all ages “eat. sleep
and drink sports. particularly the
way the world is going today."
Steinbrenner told the editors.

“When the Yankees make a
decision. eight million people know
about it the next day. and they all
think they base the answer.

Second Half Letdown Leads
Women Booters To 2-2 Tie

by Susan Milligan

Albany State's women‘s soccer
coach Atny Kidder cited “a loss ol
domination iii the second ltalf" as
the reason for I’lattsbtti‘gh‘s
comeback and ultimate 1-2 tie
against Albany last 'l'uesday.

The Albany women had clear"

control of the ball in the first of the
45 minute halves. A goal by
freshman Donna l.aMonica with

only six iiiititttcs to go iii the half

gave Albany an advantage

statistically and psychologically.
“We've fottitd that in the games we

have won. we had scored early in the

game. or at least in the first half."

Kidder said.

Sue Stern. the team‘s swiftcsl

player. scored early in the second
half to give Albany a 2—0 lead. lint
apparently. __I"lattsburgh was not

domination that they won in the

to tie the game at 2-2.

The game went into two l0-niinute
