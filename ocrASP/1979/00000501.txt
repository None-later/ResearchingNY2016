Next week, it will be Norwich. a
powerhouse team that was
undefeated until a setback in their
last outing. But before tltinking

must concentrate on Brooklyn. a
squad that even falls short of

against a very average schedule.

“They areiprobably the poorest
team we are going to face all
season." said Albany State head
football coach Brib Ford. “It isn't a
matter of trying to shut thcttr down.
We httve been working oti all aspect"
of our team. and we mtist continue
working on our passing attack and
elimitiatiiig offensive mistakes.“

The Kingsmati hayc hatl a
winning tradition in football 29
wins. nine los‘ses since [975.
including last season‘s 5-4 record.
But this year they have been
dreadful. prompting Ford to strife
that “the bottom has just fallen oitt

the best athlete on the Brooklyn

Craig (‘oker and end Alart Writers.
Another factor In the Kingsman's
dismal scasotr is their inexperience.

"They will come titit and try and
steal a win from us. We can‘t afford a
lapse. We've got to see this asa week

"lt isa natural tcndettcy to look by

by Graham C. Silllman

The University Senate Committee
voted Friday to
recommend that the SUNYA ofﬁce
of Residences withdraw the Univer-
sity's Interim Policy on Alcohol.
The policy. which seeks to limit
alcohol consumption and control
overcrowding at campus parties,
was introduced this semester by the
Residence staff. In addition, the
policy has been used to curb van-
dalism and enforce ﬁre safety laws.
The Committee. composed of
seven faculty members and ﬁve
students, questioned the present
guidelines and the necessity of an
alcohol policy. “The University has
no right to regulate how much a
person drinks." said Student Af-

fairs Committee Chair Mark
Lafayette.
The guidelines apply to ori—

campus parties held in public areas,

SUNYA Alcohol Policy

 

Requests Lifting Of Curb

such as Quad flagroom’s and
lounges.

Drinking restrictions are set at
forty ounces of beer. ten ounces of
wine, or three ounces of liquor per
person. A maximum of two kegs,
for example, would be allowed at a
party for 100 people.

Citing a lack of student input in
creating the policy, Lafayette called
it “an insult" and said its founding
has “no basis".

Director of Residence John Wel-
ty said there has been a general
decrease in vandalism since the
policy’s implementation. He added.
however, that the reduction may
not be a result of the policy.

Welty said that without a policy,
the University would be condoning
the use of alcohol. “We cannot af-

ford the old levcl of vandalism.”

Colonial Quad Board President
Mark Baldwin called the plan

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Meeting of the University Senate Committee on Residence

The group is questioning the present need for an alcohol polley.

"unenforceable. it is not going to
meet the need it was designed for."

Committee members suggested
the limits be abolished and the
policy be used as a general recom-

mendation to Quad Boaids.

In addition, it was suggested that
the Quad Boards and Residence
staff develop alternative programm-
ing to reduce the use of alcoholism,

such as a theme for parties.

Lafayette said he will call for a
vote of the Student Affairs Com-
mittee if Welty does not act on the
issue.

The Defense Attorney likened them to "Starsky and WICF"

Warren Jones, Detective Loren
Grugan, and New York State Police
Laboratory's Senior Chemist Andre
Lavigne testified against officers
Richard Vita and Michael
Buchanan.

Acton stressed that the officers
acted without required departmen—
tal authorization for any drug in-
vestigation.

Dolari said on Friday that “all
departmental investigations must be
authorized. Anyone working on an
undercover assignment must fill out
a weekly report."

He added that failure to obtain
authorization for any type of in-
vestigation would result iii depart-
mental charges.

Dolan testiﬁed that Buchanan
and Vita made formal application
to the Narcotics Division only once
while the defense argued strongly
that the ofﬁcers “were anxious to
be nare ofﬁcers just like Starsky
and Hutch."

Dolan added. “Experience ob-
tained through unauthorized inv
vestigation would have a very
negative effect on the selection pro-
cess."

Grugan and Jones were question-
ed about a search of Vita’s car on
March 28. Grugan testified that be
found "vegetation" in Vita's
unlocked glove compartment.

. Lavigne described the procedure
for receipt and labelling of the
evidence found in the glove com-
partment. He said he conducted
three scientific tests and found
marljuana present. In all the
evidence discovered.

 

On Monday, Dolan was recalled
to testify that police records state
Buchanan served art the Narcotics
Division iii 1976. He said the defen—
dant worked as an assistant from
August 3-7, btit did no undercover
work and received no training in
narcotics at this time. “He was just
filling in," be said.

Defense Attorneys Paul E.
Cheesentan and [3. Stewart Jones
requested a mistrial because of the
“prosecution's distortion of. the

owntown Waterhu Hall on Alumni and

    
   

case and proof based only on
heresay.” said Cliceseman. He add-
ed that lie had been “unduly
restricted in his cross examina-
tion."

Judge Harris ruled that there was
“no justification for a mistrial"
and advised the defense attorneys to
take their complaint to the appellate
court after the trial was over.
