THE RETURN
OF MANSON

t The Long Beach Independent, in
a bizarre copyrighted report, is
claiming that the Charles Manson
family is once again attempting a
comeback. '

‘ — Thgjndependenr, published out '

'of’Long Beach. California, says
federal and local law enforcement
ofﬁcials have uncovered evidence
that scattered remnants of Charles
Manson’s family are on a crime
spree aimed at freeing him and
“other members of his violence
prone cult" from prison. The
newspaper also alleges that persons
linked to the Symbiorlbse Libera-
tion Army are joining the crime
clan.

According to the newspaper, FBI
agents and police in several Califor-
nia cities have evidence that the

Manson clan. which reportedly’still
has some 60 members, and the
SLA. which is said to have over 100
members, are allegedly recruiting
new followers and have joined
forces.

This new Manson SLA group
has, according to the newspaper.
gone on a crime spree which in-
cludes a series of Northern Califor-
nia bank robberies and an intricate
highly lucrative credit card scam.
The group has allegedly raised to
date almost $2 million, targeted.
toward freeing Charles Manson and
other SLA members still in prison.

DOORS NOW

The movie “Apocalypse Now"
has apparently created renewed in-
terest in the music of The Doors.
whose song “The End" is featured
prominently in the film.

The Doors' keyboardist Ray
Manzarek was originally asked to
arrange some of the group's songs
for "Apocalypse Now." Manzarek,

 

 

however. had to bow out of the
project to ﬁnish the album. “An
American Prayer," which features
the late Jim Morrison reading his
poetry, backed by the original
members of The Doors.

Manurek now claiins he'll be us-
ing the ideas he originally intended
for “Apocalypse Now" on his next
solo album. His manager told
Zodiac News that Manurek’s solo
LP will be one of his most am-
bitious projects since the break-up
of The Doors in the early 1970's.

in addition to his solo LP, Man-
zarek will also be producing two
new Los Angeles bands, “The Zip-
pers" and “The X’s" for the in-
dependent Siash record label.

NUCLEAR
RETROSPECTIVE

’At least 200 people and perhaps
as many as 23,000 living outside a

SO-mile radius of the Three Mile'

island nuclear facility could have
died of radiation-induced cancer if
the worst possible accident had oc-
curred at Three Mile island last
March.
