Seabrook - Site Of Boundless Energy And u

On October 6; 1979. 2.500 demonstrators protesting the construction of a nuclear power
plant at Seabrook, New Hampshire. attempted an indeﬁnite takeover of the facility. In the
four day melee that followed. twenty-three persons were arrested as National Guardsmen
sought to protect the site from the demonstrators. The Seabrook nuclear po wer plant, under
construction since 1976, has been a source of persistent controversy. The/allowing are a selec-

tion of letters and essays we have received concerning the Seabrook story:

Seabrook Diary: Four Days

We arrived in New Hampshire at 11:00
pm. Friday night October 5. As we were
unloading our backpacks. a crowd of about
200 were signing the “love round": “Love,
love, love. love. people we are made for love.
Love each other as thyself. We are One."
This set the tone for the next four days. Six
hours later 34 thousand people were to begin
their “assault” on the fences of the Seabrook
Nuclear Power Plant. Our goal: to peacefully
occupy the site and stop construction. We
were all ready to build an alternate living en-
vironment.

A. 8:00 11."). we were at the fence after suc-
cessfully avoiding attempted setbacks by the
police. The power plant is located on a
marsh. In order to get to the South cd of the
plant. you must cross a marsh. We had btrilt
bridges out of tires and wood to help travel
over the water. Police used boats to break
our pontoous. Net/crtlicless we managed to
get across. 500 state troopers and National
Guardsmen had been ordered to protect the
power plant.

At the fence we were confronted by the

police. To avoid any major confrontation.
we decided to spread out along the 7‘ miles
surrounding the plant. Whenever we attemp-
ted to get in through the fence, the police,
who were under orders, maced, clubbed, and
used teargas to disperse the crowd. 'l'hc
police often confiscated backpacks. There
were not enough of us. and nobody really ex-
pected our protest to be successful. We were
badly dcfcalcd. Saturday night cvcryonc met
and discussed what had gone wrong with thc
day. We also decided what action to tttkc
Sunday.

We all returned to the fences Sunday. only
to find the police using more violence. Late
Sunday afternoon we held a "sit-in” outside
the main gate of tltc nuclear power plant. We
sat peacefully and no attempt was made at
cutting the fence. For three hours the police
tried to force us to leave. We were maced,
ﬁre hosed. and tcargasscd. However. this
time we were'victorious.

We didn’t move and finally the police ccas-

, at we a

cd their tactics. Some people camped their
Sunday and Monday nights. Although we did
fail to occupy. the police were doing that for
us. Construction was halted Saturday morn-
ing, and resumed Tuesday morning. It nor-
mally goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
We now had to decide what to do.

Again Sunday and Monday the protesters
all met. it was similar to a town meeting.
Decisions were only made if there was a con~
scnsus. Only uanimously passed proposals
were adopted. Meetings therefore were very
long - six hours - but everything was
unanimous; we were onci

it was decided that we would continue our
blockade Monday. Monday night we decided
to end the blockatc Tuesday morning. so as
to avoid any possiblc confrontation with the
workers. We decided to dctnonstratc outside
the courthouse whcrc tcn demonstrators were
being arraigned. lly this time there were only
400 protesters. Again the police used physical
force to deter us.

We were pressured by the police to be off
our campsite by Tuesday night. (They ob-
viously did not want us around.) Most people
went home. By Wednesday morning nine
people were out ofjail and only about 50 of
its were left.

in past attempts to occupy construction
sites. demonstrators corntnittirtg this act of
“Civil Disobedicncc" have been arrested.
(lndian l’oint. Shorcltatn, Seabrook 1977.)
Never before has vioicnce been used to such a

degree at a peaceful, non-violent rally. l hopc
this does not set a trend. (We must all
remember Kent State.)

in 1977, MM people were arrested at
Seabrook. One year later 700 of tltctn were
released, charges dropped. The New Hamp-
shire court systcm could not handle this
many cases. The new governor was determin-
ed to avoid a recurrence of this situation.
This time the State resorted to violence. The
governor ordered no mass arrests. He told
the press, though, that demonstrators would
“pay the price of arrest and prosecution."

One could argue that cutting a fence is an
act of violence. it is. Since when, though,
does personal property come before human
bodies? if someone is breaking the law and
police areprescnt. they are not supposed to
use violence to stop the violaterl it is my
understanding that the penal system in this
country is not based on the principle “an eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."

For four days people throughout the na~
tion were shown that government not only
actively supports private businesses but that
government protects private enterprises.
Why was there no power plant security
patrol? The town of Seabrook has voted the

plant down on four separate occasions,
Government has ignored this and has let con-
struction take place. Now when citizens use
one of their rights. the right to asscmblc
pccefully, their government uses tltcir tax
money to protect big business.

Perhaps next year there will be enough
demonstrators. so that we will not hc stop.
ped. However. what will the State use tilcn.
guns? in any event. with titnc. and in“...
thorough organizing, we will not be stopped,
We. the people. will win what wc arc lighting
for.

The Meaning of Non-Violence

Non-symbolic Direct Action tactics were
implemented at Seabrook for the first titnc
with tltc October 6th Action. After every
form of legal recourse was exhausted and
construction and the eventual completion of
the ttucicar reactor looked incvitablc. the
people involved with the anti-nuke movc-
ntcnt. more speciﬁcally the people in the New
England area, decided to go to Seabrook and
attempt to halt construction. The plans were
quite specific. This was not to be simply a ral-
ly. although thch would be rallies in cott-
junction with it. Nor was it to be exclusively a
civil disobedience action in which titcrc
would be sit-ins and protests entailing things
like trespassing. The reason behind going to
Seabrook this time was occupation of the
site. and the setting up of a permanent com—
munity therc. Over three thousand people
came prepared to live. plant. and learn while
or. site. A successful occupation of a similar
ualurc was attempted several times and even-
tually achieved at the nuclear plant site in
Wltyl, Wcst Germany. Occttpiers stayed for
eighteen months and permanently halted
construction. preventing the completion of a
nuclear plant they did not want.

What we found itt Seabrook was a com-
munity totally in support ofour movement. a
Iocalpolicc l'orcc also supportch of ottr ac-
tions tltcrc. and police forces called in from
six New linglaud states and the National
Guard ready and willing to mace, club. and
hose a peaceful. organized demonstrations of
the pcoplc's disenchantment with current
government and private corporate activities.

Basically the idea behind “Question
Authority" and direct action organizing is
similar in motivation and ideology. They are
as old and entrenched in the United States as
the American Revolution, as present-day as

nchained Reactions

The strategies worked through at Seabrook
were wellthought out, conscious attempts to
implement these goals through a process of
non-violent change. The people who took
part were required to train in the organiza-
tion and implementation of these techniques
in the hope of attaining these ends. All ac-

On The Question of Democracy

. . . May I ask what right the people of
Seabrook have to voice their opinions on the
construction of a nuclear power plant that
does not concern them? The businessmen
who wanted to construct the plant had
bought tltc land. They had every right to do
with it what they wanted. The neighboring
people had no rigltt to tell them to move
clscwhcre. As an analogous situation. what
would you say if a black fantin were tnoviug
to an all white neighborhood and all the
white families voted them out? Would you
tell the black family to move elsewhere just
because they had been voted out by a
dctnocrutic proccss'.’

. Without nuclear power the United
States would soon become dominated by the
Soviet Union. it is perfectly simple to see;
Nuclear power plants currently generate four
percent of ottr nation’s electricity. lit the
years to cotnc the United States will need
tnorc and tttorc power. if oil itnports arc to
remain the satire. that additional power will
have to come front some other source.
Although some of it can come from synthetic
fuels, the majority of it is going to have to
cotnc from tntclcar power. If the United
States were to cut back on Its consumption of
power, a number of companies would be
forced out of business because they did not

 

tions of the sort at Seabrook help to actuate a
process by which the people can once again
take hold of their government and country to
see the introduction of their children into a
safe and peaceful world community.

have enough energy to keep them going. This
would create a rise in unemployment which
would cause inflation and a scriobs recession. ‘
The Unitcd States would be iii no position to
defend itstlf from attack front the Soviet
Union. The Soviet Union would simply walk
in arid take over our country arid force
Americans to work for them for very low
wages.

After that happened you would know why
the Uttitcd States is considered a democracy.
Instead of voting for your rcprcscntativcs,
congressmen and president. yott would bc
governed by a military dictator. If you corn-
plaincd about how
undcntocratic your government was. you
would be arrested. torturctl. mid possibly
killcd.

So don‘t talk about how undemocratic ottr
govcrtuncnl is. There are millions of people
all over the world who work long ltard hours
seven days a week. And all they get for it is
just barely enough to live on. They would
love to switch places with you. So if you
don't think the United States is good enough
for you. why don't you get ottt and go to
some country that you think is better than
ours.

Tin Soldiers And I'Nuk'es Are Coming...

It has been said that violence is the last refuge of the insane, and the proteser at
Seabrook knew that. They knew that a peaceful, orghnized effort to bring across a
message of feeling would be more effective than resorting to any sort of physical
confrontation. i

And so. the Seabrook protesters, thousands of them. came to Seabrook. New
Hampshire armed only with the feeling that nuclear power isn’t right; it isn't safe
and there are better methods of energy production. The National Guard stopped by
as well. armed with a plentiful supply of mace and a reserve of hostility.

So the protesters at Seabrook got maced, and a lot of them were billy clubbed, but
that doesn’t diminish the reason for their taking that‘kind of treatment; for putting
up with the injustices done to them.

They were there to stop nuclear power and the National Guard stopped them.

One can talk of Freedom of Speech, freedom of this, freedom of that. and all
sorts of democratic rhetoric, but the bottom line is putting it into practice. If you
can't, then it isn‘t freedom at all.

The protesters at Seabrook were only free to go home, and many did so morally or
physically hurt. if it takes a death or two to make another Kent State, how ironic
and tragic that would be. The ultimate loss of freedom in the name of liberty.

What one thinks about nuclear or any issue is irrelevant. What is relevant is spray-
ing mace in the medic’s tent. billy clubbing people on private property. and denying
people their fundamental rigltts.

A decade ago the National Guard fougltt words with weapons and now they’re
doing it again. Only this time let's hope no one has to die before someone does
something about it.

Evaluating Aptitude Tests

After taking the Graduate Record exam last Saturday it occurcd to us that the
Ci.R.E.'s, S.A.T.‘s, and other so-callcd “Aptitude Tests" are. in fact, ridiculous.
The purpose of these tests are contradictory to the aims of a Liberal Arts education.
A test should be a measurement of learning used to evaluate a student’s strengths
and weaknesses. The G.R.l3.'s. S.A.T.'s. etc. do not do this. The student does not
benefit from these tests. He or she does not get an indication of where their educa-
tion might need reinforcement. it is totally a mastabatory exercise to classify
students by how well they can manipulate test questions. not how well they think.
The only way an “Aptitude Test" could truly be of value and test aptitude is if they
are changed and given on a yearly basis with no threat of a sticking grade. This way
a student would see a yearly evaluation of his or her thinking capacity and
knowledge. And only then would the student benefit from the test which is, after
all. their purpose. Otherwise these “Aptitude Tests" are an expense of mind in a
waste of titnc.
