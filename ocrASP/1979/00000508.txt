Danes Toy With Brooklyn, 56-0

continued from 'page twenty

quarter proved to be disastrous
ones for Brooklyn, as the stubborn
Albany defense showed no signs of
letting up against an unimaginative
Brooklyn offense. Their runs were
directed right at the heart of the
Albany defensive line, and when
Sajecki threw, his receivers rarely
held on. So it was not surprising
when they moved in reverse instead
of forwards.

On the third down and 16. from
the Brooklyn 14. Sajecki ws tackled
by reserve end Jeff Carone for a
seven-yard loss. Punting from his
end zone. Sid Scholoman’s kick was
battered away by the Danes' Daryl
Haynor, who burst in’from the left
side. Haynor recovered the ball in
the end zone and it was 21-0 after
the successful PAT conversion by
Dario Arattgo. who was booming
kickoffs all afternoon.

For the rest of the half, Dane
fullback Bruce Churcltwcli was in
the spotlight. Not seeing that much
action oflatc due to the fine play of
sophomore Chuck Priorc. Chur—
chwell made his presence felt by
taking a ltandoff from Walsh and,

racing 39 yards to paydirt. This
came only three minutes after
Haynor's touchdown.

“it ws a veer play off tackle."
said Churchwcil, who had great
help from his offensive line on the
play. “As soon as i broke one
tackle and i saw daylight. I knew i
was in." Before too long. Chur-
chwell was there again. The ever-
present Dane defense set up the six
points as lineman Sal lndelicato in-
tercepted a Sajecki pass on a long
yardage situation and ran it back to
the Kingsmen’s four. Churchweli
then bullcd his way through to com-
plete the first half scoring.

The second half was the scene of
quarterback changes on both sides.
with Pepe Carrubba replacing a
shelishocked Sajecki and junior
Mike Fiorito giving Walsh an ex-
tended breather. in addition, se-
cond and third-string players were
shufﬂed in and out as the outcome
of the contest was certainly not in
doubt.

Neither quarterback distinguish-
ed himself with spectacular perfor-
mances. but the Danes' offense
reacted favorably to Fiorilo's

presence. The unit totalled 229 E

more yards on the ground than in
the ﬁrst half . with sophomore Dave
Warheit the workhorse, gaining 53
yards on it carries.

Although the Danes ran circles
around the Brooklyn defense;
Burger. for one. was impressed by
their physical play. "They probably
were the hardest-hitting team we
played this year." Burger said.
"They weren't very disciplined.
though. and made a lot of
mistakes."

Albany receiver Scott Lusher
compensated for his first quarter in-
tercepted pass on a split and option
play by successfully converting a
misdirection run for a 50-yard
touchdown early in the second half.

“There was just one guy in the
backfield and he was waiting for
me," Lushcr said. “When i go by
hint. there was a wall of purple
jerseys. ljusl ran like a sprinter but
l'nt not as fast as one."

The remaining Dane tallies all oe-

cured in the third quarter, including _

another four-yard score by Burger
and Tim Votraw's end-around
scamper on a third and 25 from
Brooklyn's 27 line.

in the waning moments of the
game and Albany once again mov-
ing beyond Brooklyn's 10-yard line,
Warheit asked for a time out. But
as third string quarterback Tom
Pratt looked toward the sidelines,
Ford signalled the freshman to fall
on the ball, which is exactly what
Pratt did.

After the game, Ford
acknowledged that he didn't want
to intentionally run up the score.
When he coached Albany as a club
team, beginning back in l970, Ford
was on the other end of such routs
and as he remembers. “it wasn't a
good feeling." _

Allen Leibowitz will definitely
agree. He's Brooklyn College’s
head coach.

After Beating Texas,
Arkansas Faces Houston

(AP) it’s out of the frying pan and
into the fire for the Arkansas
Razorbacks. Or. as Coach Lou
Holtz put it Saturday after his 10th
ranked Razorbacks knocked off
No. 2 Texas 17-14, “this was not a
pardon, this was merely a
reprieve."

What does Holtz mean'l Take it

away Lou.
“Next week we have to play the
Houston Cougars, and ldon't have
