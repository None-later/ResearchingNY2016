continued from page twenty
after one half.

“We held up well in the first
half,” said Schieffelin, “We had a

couple of very‘ good chances to_

score.';' On one occasion Nezaj
lifted the ball over the head of
Quinlin, who was out of position,
and watched it bounce towards the
net only to have a defender knock it
away.

A goal by Binghamton's Mike
Glenon at the 32:10 mark of the se-
cond half appeared to wrap the
game up. Albany trailed 2-0 with
less than 13 minutes remaining.

However, the booters got back in
the game in a hurry. Less than two
minutes after Glenon's score, Jeff
Mazin beat the Binghamton
fullback and pushed the ball to

Robert Dahab. who promptly drill-
ed the ball into the right corner of
the net behind Quinlin to put the
Danes back in the match.

This sudden resurgence in the
Albany attack was spurred by
Schieffelin moving Pagano to
center halfback following Bingham-
ton’s second goal. ‘

“Alex did a fantastic job of get-
ting our offense going," said
Schieffelin.

Unfortunately for the booters'
comeback bid, it was only moments
later that Pagano was fouled and
injured and had to leave the game.
His replacement was Roberto
Ramirez. a forihe J.V. player with
little varsity experience.

“After Alex left they were all
over us," commented Giordano.

“They broke down our defense and
destroyed us the last 10 minutes."

It was during this time that Bob
Slerish tallied the home sides third
goal to ice the game.

“They definitely dominated us
physically. They subbed constantly
and just wore us down," said
Pagano.

“Binghamton was up for the
game." commented defender Jack
Chiarelli, “If we could have had
more substitutes l think we would
have done better."

Albany now has their back to the
wall as far as an NCAA playoff
spot is concerned. They must win
both of their remaining games to re-
‘main in contention.

Nationally ranked St. Francis
(10-2-1) will be the next opposition
for the booters when they invade
Albany this Saturday. Despite the
reputation of their foe, the Danes
are confident.

"St. Francis plays our type of

skill and one touch game." remark-V

ed Giordano. “This will help us
because our, styles won't interfere
with each other." ‘ _

“it will be a very interesting
game,” said Schieffelin, “It could

mean a playoff bid for both teams,
However we have a week to get our
team healthy and I'm conﬁdent we
can beat them. Both teams will have
their backs to the wall."

, Mistakes Hurt
Boaters Lose to RP], 5-1

by Marc Haspel

The Albany State Junior Varsity
soccer team lost by a score of 5-1 to
RPI Saturday afternoon on the
Danes' home field. Although the
team consists of young, talented
players, Albany J.V. soccer coach
Arthur Bedford belieVes that his
team is just standing'around and
letting the other teams win.

Bedford arrived late, approx-
imately ﬁve minutes into the game
after the start had already been
delayed for 15 minutes. Thus,
Albany was forced to play with
relatively no pregame warmup.

Again in Saturday’s contest,
mistakes were common on Albany’s
part. Bedford blames these
mistakes on lack of discipline and
experience. “For example." Bed-
ford said, "when you play bigger
guys, you have to keep the ball on
the ground. But against RPl. we
just kept it in the air."

Because of careless plays
throughout the game, the Danes’
offense was unable to score. Besides
the unusual assortment of missed
heads and sloppy passes that
resulted in turnovers, the Albany
players lacked the awareness of
where to be and when. Rather than

~ tm~ww~w mu ir’vm‘ -

as IJ.V.' I

going up on offense. the half-backs
were laying back on defense.
“We're getting no offensive sup-
port from the halfbacks," Bedford
said. _

1n the first half, despite initial
pressure by Albany‘s offense, three
quick unanswered goals by RP] set

' the tempo of the game. Dane left
half-back Matthew Quinn faulted
the goals on a lack of cohesion
defensively. “The goals were due to
a breakdown in communication in
the defense," said Quinn.

Consequently, going into the se-
cond half of the play, Albany, be-
ing down 3—0, faced a tough uphill
climb. Midway through the half.
right half-back Pat Henrie scored
at unassisted goal cutting RPl's
lead at the time to 3-1. After the
game, Henrie described the goal: “I
had the half-back faked out and I
thought I could put it in on the
short side with a strong shot. and it
went in," he said. ’

A gotil like that sometimes may
spark a learn on, however that was
not to be as Albany failed to score
again. Albany right fullback Mark
llucklcy cited this inability to score
as being due to low icani morale.
Said Buckley, “There is a lack of

after-RPI was awarded a penalty

of Albany’s net.

Bedford summarized the loss by
saying. “We're beating ourselves.
that's all there is to it." Redford '
feels his team needs work on
shooting and building offensive op-
portunities, because without those
you cannot score. With their record
standing at 14-2, Redford is hoping
for a .500 ﬁnish this season.

J. V. Gridders
Lose to Army

by Bob Bellaflore

The Albany State J.V. football
team was beaten by Division I Ar-
my last Friday, 35-l4, in a game
played at West Point. The'defeat
pushed Albany‘s record to 2—4.

The Danes scored in the second
quarter on a 24-yard bootleg pass
from freshman quarterback Tom
Pratt to Mike Cordisco, and again
put points on the board-with less
than two minutes left in the game,
on a 32-yard pass from quarterback
Toni Lincoln to halfback Curt
Lewis.

Albany head .l.V. football coach
Tom Mayer cited the loss as a
“personnel thing. They were better
drilled than we were,” Mayer said.
“We got beat dccp a couple of

times defensively." Twice, the
Dane secondary was burned on long
touchdown passes. Mayer also

pointed ottl that the Cadets only
had one long drive, in which they
just ‘onthorsed us.’

“We weren’t consistently con-
trolling thc ball. Without the big

plays. it would have been closer.
Nobody quit. We gave them too
lllliL‘ll in the first half (21-8),"

Mayer said. “They lmd some real
great talent."

the season continues this Friday,
as perennial junior college
powerhouse Nassau Community
College invades University Field at
3:30 pm.

Women Harriers
3rd At Hartwick

Aided by a first place finish by
Leslie Price, the Albany State
women's cross country team ran to
a third plaice finish at this
weekend‘s Hartwick invitational.

l'ricc conquered the extremely
hilly 5000 meter course in Oneonta
with a time of 20:18, which
established a new record for the
course. Price paced herself with
Vicki Kraft of Syracuse and St.
John's Mary Ann Personne for the
first portion of the race, but the
Albany runner passed her two op-
poncnts down the stretch to win go-
ing away.

Hartwick was the victor in their
own invitational with 42 points,
followed by Syracuse with 59,
Albany 67. and St. Lawrence 95.
The third place ﬁnish marked the
first time the Albany team has been
defeated by a Division III squad all
season.

Coming in second for Albany
was Diane Kirchoff with a time of
23:21 , a clocking good enough for a ‘
13th place finish in the meet. Other
scorers for Albany were Kim
Bloomer (24:!3) in 18th place
overall. freshman Noreen Walsh
(24:26) 19th in the meet, and Judy
Ungewitter (24:29), who placed
20th in the Invitational.

The Alba'ny women's cross coun—
try squad next sees action at the
Albany Invitational this weekend.
