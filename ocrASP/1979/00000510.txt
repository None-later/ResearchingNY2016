Harriers Rebound For Second Place In SUN YAC’s 

 

Albany Co-Captain Bill
Mathis Finishes Second

by Harold Diamond

One difference between a good
team and a mediocre team is the
ability to recover from a had
outing. The Albany State varsity
cross country team rebounded from
their embarrassing showing in the
Capital District meet by finishing
second among 10 learns at the
SUNYAC meet in Gcncseo.

Albany‘s score of 65 points was
second only to that of l‘rcdonia‘s 46
points. They did defeat these
schools who had the following
scores: Platlsburgh 76. Binghamton
78. Cortland 124. Genesco 152.
Buffalo State 212. Brockport 221,
Oswego 253. and the University of
Buffalo. a team that had no score.

Albany co-captain llill Mathis
regained his top-notch form on the
10,000 meter course. He took the
lead at the 5.000 meter point. and
led until Plattsburgh’s Bob Russell
challenged him with 300 yards left.
It was one on one to the finish line.
Russell won. finishing with the win-
ning time of 33:19. Mathis was just
one second behind him. finishing
second with a time of 33:20.

This fine performance was ac-
complished despite Mathis develop-
ing cramps while finishing the race.
He had been running so hard that
he had a mild case of heat exhaus-
tion.

Other outstanding performances
were demonstrated by co-captain
Jack Russo and sophomore Scott
James. This was the second con-
secutive week that both these run-
ners had run together during the lat-
ter portion of the race. Last week in
the Capital District meet. they ran
one-two for Albany during the last
5.000 meters.

Russo and James had completely
different strategies for the first half
of the SUNYAC race. James
started out strong while Russo trail-
cd some 20 runners at the 4.000
meter point. This is where Russo
picked up the pace to catch James.

They worked together as if they
were one runner dttrittg the last
5.000 meters. They each passed
several runners on a long 700 yard
hill at the four mile point. This hill
was so difficult that it forced two
runners. one front Gencsco and the
other frorn Buffalo State. to col-
lapse.

Russo and James placed second
and third. respectively. for Albany.
Russo finished sixth in the meet
with a time of 33:53. His teammate

Mathis. Russo and James were
named All-Conference for finishing
among lhc lop seven spots. This is
remarkable as they had competed
against 75 of SUNY's fittest run-
ncrs.

Mike Sayers looked strong as he
placed fourth for the Albany har-
riers with the time of' 35:14. Fifth
place was sitaer by two runners;
Dave Ralhjens and Bob Johnson at
35:20. Both Rathjcns and Johnson
have improved greatly this season.

Johnson was named Rttnncr of
the Meet by Albany cross courtlt‘y
coach Bob Munsey. He usually
finishes in the bottom ofthe Albany
pack. Yet his strong determination
led him to his best race of the year.
He finished 2511] among 75 other
runners.

Rathjens ran a fine race.
finishing 27th. yet he did cncoutttcr
one problem. He hurt himself on
the water jump. Rathjcns had to
straddle a stream using a cinder
block to bounce off. He went too
fast and hit his shin against the
block. Ralhjcns continued un-
daunted without showing any signs
of pain.

Munscy was relieved at his team‘s
comeback. c said. “They came
through a nightmare the week
before. It was the second meet that
the team had psyched themselves up
for the hills.”

Munscy was referring to the har-
ricr's mastery of Colgatc's Payne
Hill. Likein Colgate. Albany open-
ed up much ground on the hills.

All-Conference runner James has
sonic predictions about the team's
future. He said. “The team has a

lot more confidence in itself now. I
think we can be surprising in the
ttcxt couple of big meets."

The Junior Varsity cross cottnlry
extended their winning streak to
seven last Wednesday by defeating
Coblcskill. 19-37 and Plattsburgh.

22-34.
This home meet was no contest
thanks to the running of Albany’s

. Mike Alfano and John Cordi. Both

were' named Co-Runncrs of the
Meet. '

Alfano started out at a moderate
pace on the 4.25 mile course. He
was 11th at the two mile marker. He
was urged on by his teammate Cor-
di to challenge the front runners.
Cordi and Alfano moved from the
11th position to the first during the
next mile. Alfano pulled ahead
with Cordi behind him at the four
mile point. The two of them paced
each other well. Alfano was far
ahead as he climbed the last hill
around the lake. yet he saved
enough energy to sprint the last 300
yards. He won the race with a win-
ing time of 22:45. which is the fifth
fastest time in Albany State history.
Cordi was directly behind him with
a second place time of 22:58.

Other fine performances were
demonstrated by Frank Yunkcr.
who finished fourth at 23:11. Chrin
Lant. sixth at 23:19 and Julir-
Medina. 12th at 23:46.

This double win kept the squa'
ready for the New i’altz Varsit;
team last Saturday. The Alharq
Jayvccs embarrassed the New Ptti' '
Varsity. Four of their eight runnc‘
dropped out of the race. The for:

no match for the JV's. Sever.
Albany runners finished ahead of

‘ the top New Paltz runner.

The winner of the meet was Todd
Silva. Silva has been in a slump this
year. He started on the varsity team
and was demoted last week to the
junior varsity. But Silva dominated
the 5.25 mile course in the time of

~29:36.

The win over New Paltz ended
the Albany junior varsity cross
country regular season at 12-2-1
with the Albany Invitational re-
maining this weekend. The 12 wins
are a new Junior Varsity record.

Women Boaters Lose To Rochester

by Susan Milllgan

The Albany State women’s soccer
learn suffered their second loss of
the season. 2-1, at the University of
Rochester last Saturday.

The women were disadvantaged
at lllc start of‘ the game because of a
delay in arriving at Rochester. The
team had less titan 30 minutes to
warm up. Bad field conditions -
much of the field was ttttdcr walcr »
also inhibited the team‘s perfor-
mance.

Sue Stern of Albany scored the
first goal of the game. her fifth of
the season. but the Albany offense
just was not playing up to par. In
the second half of the game.
Rochester scored twice whilc
Albany remained scoreless

throughout the second half.

The Albany women did play an
excellent defensive game. in spite of
their loss. Liz Kirk, usually at goal.
performed well as fullback.
Heather Turner also played an
outstanding game as sweeper.

Coach Amy Kidder is optimistic

_ in spite of the loss to Rochester.

“Statistics other than wilt-loss
records really show our improve-
ment and strength.“ said Kidder.
“We have still outscored our op-
ponenls 15—9. We have scored every
game. and we have never lost by
more than one poittt. All we really
luck is age and experience. As we
become tnore experienced, we will
play a more consistent game and it
will show in our record."

Yet certainly the Albany
women‘s soccer team has a respec-
table rccord at 3-2—2. And there is
definite teamwork - tltose 15 goal
credits are divided among six
players.

“The girls are learning things
now that they can only learn while
playing ball." said Kidder. “Next
year their increased experience will
make for a wirtning season."

The squad‘s next game is
Wednesday when the Albany team
hosts Berkshire.
