the Danes to kick off. recover a
fumble on the game's first play
from scrimmage. and score on a
four-yard run by halfback Jack
Burger.

With the extra point failing, a 6-0
final at least would indicate respec~
tability. However. this juncture
marked only the start of it trying

halftime, they trailed 35-0. By the}

game’s finish. they would have only
three ﬁrst downs and 40 total yards.
while allowing l7 and 376, respec-
tively. to the 5-0 Danes.

' Albany State head football coach
Bob Ford was not at all shocked by

either the quick touchdown, or for ‘

that matter. the final result. “We
knew they were probably a weak
opponent." Ford said. “That’s the
way it should go."

Maintaining the status quo of an
outstanding defense and a big-play
offense that has problems develop-
ing a passing attack, the Danes
gained their third shutout of the
season. and had scoring plays of 50,
39. 38. and 27 yards among their
eight touchdowns. The final passing
statistics were not as impressive:
two of l0 completions for 33 yards
with one interception.

“We're coming along," Ford
said. “But we had too muclt
penetration in the interior litte.
When we did try to pass the foot—
ball. there was too nruch pressure."

Trying to put the final score in
perspective was Brooklyn's Sports
lnfortnation Director. Milt
Schwartz. “If we would have had
our eight starters that were declared
academically ineligible at the start
of the season. it would have been a
different story," said
Schwartz.“l'm ttot saying we would
have won. but it wouldn't have-
becn a whitewash."

The reason for this manpower
shortage is that forrr players on the
team's original roster are missing
because they are injured or have
simply left the team.

However. injury problems cer-
tainly cannot be used entirely as an
alibi for the upset. The aggressive
tackling of the Binghamton
defenders upset the patterns of
Albany’s offense.

“This was our worst game of the
year." said Giordano. “We were
paying too much attention to their

trating on playing our style of

Soccer Playoff Hopes Battered By Binghamton

With the constant injuries to the at-
tackmen this season the lack of
firepower was not surprising. The
Danes have netted only 13 goals in
tO games to date.

What was surprising was the
lackluster perforntancc Saturday by
the defense. Normally the backbone
of the team with their steady play
the back line allowed three goals for
the first time this year.

"We had a defensive lapse. They
had some very quick forwards who
burned us a couple oftimcs." noted
Schieffelin.

The, first lapse came with 13:46
played in the first half. Striker Mike
Dohcrty took a pass from Jimmy
Berardecuiti on a Binghamton
counterattack. dribbled past an
Albany defender and smashed the
ball past Giordano. The goal broke
a shutout streak of 39l minutes by
the Albany defense dating back to
the Brockport match on October 6.

The defense held up for the re—
mainder of the half with Giordano
having to make only one stop.
Albany was very much in the game
