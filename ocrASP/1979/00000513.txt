"Poll Reveals Present Disillusionment

Associated Press

The average American today
believes that the past was betterthan
the present and that the future will
be even worse, says pollster Daniel
Yankelovich.

“We‘ve gone almost overnight
from a nation of optimists to a
nation of pessimists." Yankelovielt
said at a recent conference in
Philadelphia on “Coping with
Economic Uncertainty."

Yankelovich. head of the firm of
Yank‘clovich. Skelly & White. cited
these signs of gloom:

—— Almost half of all Americans
(48 percent) say they are having
trouble paying for housing. l’itc

Americans also are becoming less

said. Fewer people show a "raw.

Yankeloyiclt said the economic

Observant Jews Protest

Scheduling of Finals

by Brian G. Schwagerl

Jewish students on SUNYA‘s
campus are protesting on religious
grounds the scheduling of final
examinations on Saturday.
December 22.

SUNYA Jewish Students
Coalition President Mark Gurvis
has requested assurance of make-up
exams for students missing finals for
religious reasons. SUNYA
administrators are expected to take
action on his proposal shortly.

Shabhat. according to Gtirvis. “is
a weekly celebration ofthe Sabbath"
which entails “not writing aitd not
doing things normally done dtiriiig
the neck." The liolidtiy begins at
sundown each Friday and lasts until
Saturday sttttdoytti.

3:35. in addition to those which meet
regularly oii Saturday. are
scheduled for Saturday fitiitl exams
this semester.

“It's not as much a case of
calendar policy as it is of state law."
said SUNYA Assistant to the
President J. Frederick Volkwein.
“State law and University policy
prevent us from penalizing students
for reasons of religious conflicts."

Last year sescral students liiid
trouble rescheduling their Saturday
final exams \\llll professors evcit
though they claimed legitimate
reasons for not wanting to take
them.

"Professors lime a iitiinbcr of
tilteritatites." said Volkwcin. “They

“Sometimes the sincerity of one's

in rescheduling her management
