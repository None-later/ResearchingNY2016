“This game is our season." said
. rlbany co-captain John Veruto. "if
we win. there should be no question
that we go to the playoffs. We‘re in a
great position. The last two years.
everyone else was determined
where we were going. This year it's
In our hands; we control where
we're going."

"This is certainly a crucial

ballgame. but it Is only one In a
series," added Albany State head
football coach Bob Ford. "If we lose
to Norwich. it would dim our playoff
chances considerably. If we win, It
will keep us very much alive. if they
would select the teams this Sunday. I
Would say 'yes. this is the game.‘ At
this point. it will definitely be an in-
fluence upon who is selected. but if
we lose to lthaca next week and For-
dham the following week. it won‘t
matter much what we do against
Norwich."

However. losses by the Danes In
both contests after Norwich is unlike-
ly; thus Albany's playoff ambitions
could go a long way in becom-
ing secure with a victory over the
Cadets. And the Danes will never
have a more opportune time; for the
first time since opening game.
Albany is completely healthy.

The Albany-Norwich matchup has
blossomed into an intense rivalry
over the past four years. The Danes
lead in the series 3—1. but according
to Ford. "from a spectator view-
point. they have all been great col-
lege football games. wltlt close
scores and hard hitting by both
teams." Albany took the initial en-
counter 19—12. and then after
leading 20-0 at halftime of the se-
cond contest. the Cadets came roar-
ing back and came away with a
24-20 victory. in 1978. the Danes
trailed 14-0 at the trail in Vermont.
but this time Albany was the com-
eback team. winning 19-14.

Following in their tradition. tlte
l‘J79 Cadets are a superlative offeri-
sive machine. and their numbers
stand as proof to their uncanny ef-
inactiveness. Their running game is.

"They do not read for the tripkr on

said Albany defensive coordinator

the power play off tackle. Where wv
run that play maybe three times in a
game. they will use it 25. They are
power oriented. they doit'l pitch the
ball too often."

The Cadets have no need for-
finesse. their three ballcarriers can
each individually romp through any
defense As a triumvirate. they have
done just that. and they form a
multifaceted weapon that has not

slightly under eight yards every
chance he carries the football. in ad-
dition. he is the Cadets‘ leading

scorer. plowing into the endzone 11

times.

“l'd like to classify him as a money
back." said Siedleckl. “He's a tough
inside runner. but he has speed to go
outside also. We haven’t faced
runningbacks yet who are In his
category. But wt. can't key on any
one of their backs. or the others will
kill us."

One of the others ls Milt Williams
(6-1. '195). who has been one of the
premier runners in Division lll foot-
ball for three years. in 1977.
Williams entered the Albany en-
counter as the leading rusher In the
nation. and closed out that season
with 1183 yards. still a Norwich
record. But the following year. he
suffered a broken ankle and saw
limited playing time. This season.
Williams has returned to form with
(:17 yards. includirtg four con-
secutive liltl-yard performances.
Last week was vintage Williams: 120
yards. three touchdowns iit Nor-
wich's 42-24 victory over St.
Lawrence. "He isJust about as fast as
he was two years ago. but l'd say
he's a better overall runner now."
commented Siedlecki. "He's
tougher inside."

The third Cadet ground threat
spent last season becoming the All-
New England defensive tackle. Bo
Powull (5-11. 225) has been cort-
verted to the fullback spot and has
continued to knock opponents
down. but rtow. he docs it with the
football iir his liaitds. and has arnrrss
ed 441 inside yards. “l to keeps .my

in connection with their
philosophy. it is on offense when-

Luscinski anchors an offensive line
that averages 230 pounds. Norwich
“flip-flops" their linemen. so Luscin-
ski will wind up on either side. but
the task of containing Luscinski will
fall primarily on Albany defensive
tackle Larry Pearson. "That will be
the key matchup." Ford said.
“Sooner or later, he will be on
Larry's side."

“We know they are bigger than
us. but that never bothered us
before." said Pearson. “Most teams
we play outman us physically. but
we have better team speed than
most teams."

Luscinski doubles as undoubtedly
one of the nation's largest kickers.
and he utilizes his force to send his
kicks soaring. "He can probably kick
with any other kicker in the coun-
try." said Dane defensive tackle
coach Hank Hughes. who scouted
Norwich a week ago. and watched
as Luscinski booted seven out of
eight kickoffs out of the endzone.

“By far. they are the best offensive
team we've seen." Hughes said. "but
we feel we are the best defensive
learn they have seen. They don't
turn the ball over. and they will
capitalize on mlstakc . They have
the potential to break a long gain.
but they usually just grind out the
yardage and the first downs."

“We have to hold up against them

By comparison. the Cadet
defense pales when stacked up
against their offense. but their defen-
sive unit is far from shabby. They are
a mirror of the Dane defense, a 4-4
alignment with aggressive players.
but as usual with Norwich. they are
physically superior. Their two inside
linebackers. Bruce McGill (6-2. 220)
and Paul Gretsky (5-11. 220)
solidify the Cadet middle, which has
been denying to opposing runners
all season. Jim Enos (5-11. 175) is a
stalwart safety. and has lead the
Cadet defensive backfield to 20 In-
terceptions.

The Norwich defensive unit has
allowed 12 points per game. which
seems inflated only when compared
to the Dane paltry 3.6 points given
up. But last week. St. Lawrence ex-
ploited the Cadet defense. and total-
ed 27 first downs. 316 passing yards

Unlike the Danes. Norwich had
no problem reaching paydtrt early in
the season. They debuted with a
41-6 trounclttg of Plymouth and
then topped that by smashing
Worcester Polytechnic institute.
45-6.

Despite the flashy numbers. Nor-
wich head coach Barry Mynter was
not satisfied with the early play of his
squad. "We were fortunate to play
teams early on In our schedule that
are not having good years." said
Mynter in a phone interview on
Wednesday. “l was not that impress-
ed with our play."

With Division ll American interna-
tional College (AlC). the Cadets saw
their first big test of 1979. As AlC
visited Northlield on weekend
number three. Norwich was forced
to gel in a hurry.

They did. Norwich passed their
first test with flying colors by knock-

 ing off AiC 37-13. before a raucous

homecoming crowd of nearly 6.000
at the Cadets' Sabine Field.

Finally. riding a three game winn-
ing streak. having cruslted a fine
football team arid sporting the
number-one ranking in the East.

best performance to date." raved
Mynter. "They came up here feeling
they were a Division ll playoff con-
tender and we put out a super effort
to beat them."

With an offense that seems like a
time ltomb set to go off every Satur-
day afternoon. the Cadets continued
to roll.

Next they destroyed Coast Guard.
43—0. for their only shutout. arid
then backed tltai up with a 51-14
drubbing of a very physical Boston
State squad.

Still unbeaten and unthreaiened.
Norwich then prepared for the ar-
rival of highly ranked Tufts College
back on October 13.

The outcome was not to the liking
of Mynter nor the capacity throng
which again filled Sabine Field. Tufts
came back from a 19-11 halftime
deficit to pull off a 22—19 upset of the
then top-ranked Cadets.

A loss in only the sixth week of the
season was discouraging to Mynter.
The Cadets ltad a chance to put
Tufts away. only to see Cadet
quarterback Randy Grenier's pass
intercepted on the two yard line. In-
stead of a possible 26-11 lead. Nor-
wiclt saw Tufts get a second life
which they used as a springboard to
11 second half points.

had gotten a touchdown instead of
that interception it would have taken
the wtrrd out of their sails."

Having suffered a frustrating loss
and being aware that another defeat
would almost drop them out of the
playoff picture. the Cadets faced a
tough task last weekend: Trying to
rebound on the road versus St.
Lawrence University. a learn that
reached the playoffs last year.

In their typically explosive style.
Norwich validated all the
superlatives being bandied about
concerning their offensive prowess.
They put 21 quick poiitts on thi-
board and coasted to a 42-24
triumph to set up tomorrow's conflict
with Albany.

"1 was proud of the way we
bounced back against St. Lawrence.
especially playing in Caittort." said
Mynter. "The offense went out and
got 21 quick ones aliriost before St.
Lawrence touched the ball. That was
the key for us."

Formation-wise the Cadets mirror
the wishbone alignment used by the
Danes. However. Mynter employs
more passing and complementary
plays rather than a steady use of lltt‘
triple option that Alhaity is noted
for "We have a different wishbone
philosophy than Albany. We're itot
as disciplined to the straight triple
option." said Mynter.

shoe to boot a 42-yard field
goal this season while hitting a
respectable 28-34 on extra points.

"Luscinski is a very solid field goal
kicker. Also he has put several bails
out of the endzone on kick-offs. He's
been a factor for us." noted the
Cadet coach.

Despite the proven abilities of his
offensive team. Mynter is concerned
by Albany's impressive defense.

"They are very quick. which '
think is their greatest asset. Also.
they don't make many mistakes.
They're very well coached."

Tltus far the defense has been the
weakest facet of the Norwich Jugger-
naut. An example is the 417 yards
they allowed to St. Lawrence last
Saturday.

“We've been a little shaky on
defense this year." said the Norwich
mentor.

The standouts defensively have
been linebacker Bruce McGill (6-2.
220). who has been clocked in 4.6
seconds in the 40 yard dash and is
considered a pro prospect by
Mynter.

in the secondary, Jim Enos has
been the Cadets‘ top player. His two
interceptions and numerous tackles

last week not only helped the Cadets
past St. Lawrence but also earned
hint ECAC Defensive Player of the
Week honors.

“Enos has really come into his
own of late. Along with McGill. we
have two real take-charge defensive
leaders." commented Mynter.

The Norwich defenders will
square off against a Dane attack that
has blossomed as a very explosive
big play unit.

“They peck away until they break
the big one." said Mynter. referring
to Albany's flair for breaking long
touchdown runs. “Although we
haven't been lturt by the big play to
any great degree."

Mynter was reluctant
tomorrow's matchup added impor-
tancc as far as the NCAA playoffs
are concerned.

"l'm keeping a low profile on the
playoffs." hc said. “i think we got
caught looking ahead too far before
thc 'l'ufls garric. if we get to 9-1 l'll
talk about it more."

Mynter sirnrrricd up the game
best: "This will lic KI classic confron
iation. Wri'vc 1)(‘L’ii Very strcu'ssft'l
on offense this year while Albany's
strength is lit its defensive urtit. it will
be interesting."

That. Mr. Mynter. could turn out
to be the understatement of the
season.
