by Rlcll Selig-on ,

When the Norwich players and
coaches run onto University Field
tomorrow afternoon. the feeling will
hit some of them Immediately. Then
they'll approach their bench, and
suddenly. like a bad dream. the feel-
ing from two years ago will hit them
again. There he was. that number
40. in an Albany purple and white
unifrom. seemingly stopped in his
own end zone for a safety. until...

“That was the turning point in that
ball game." says Albany State head
football coach Bob Ford. “No ques-
tion about it."

"I remember standing on the
sidelines and l was worried because
it was a deep handoff. and If there
was any type of penetration, it
would be trouble." recalls the Danes'
offensive back coach Gary
Reynolds. then receiver coach.

“I don’t remember it. It was totally
a mental thing. My mind just took
control of my body. It seemed like it
was pr'It-progtarrtmed. It happened
too fast to remember." admits
number 40.

That number 40 is Sam Halstion.
and it was his 99-yard touchdown
run two seasons ago iii the second
quarter of Albany's 21~7 victory over
Norwich Ilrat derttoralized the
Cadets. After that phenomenal play.
Albany just dominated.

“5am got hit two yards behind the
backfield. but lie stayed on his feet
and made a sharp left cut." said
Reynolds. “Then he put on the jets
and found the seam. He turrted it
on."

The carry was undoubtedly the
highlight of Halstion's "54-yard two
touchdown day. He became only
the 17th.player in the history of
Division II and Division III football to
accomplish this feat of 99yards. and

 

the first in New York State to do so. '

When the regular season ended. the
sophomore was the Danes' leading
rusher -»r 842 yards on 127 Carries.

      
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 

 

Sam Halstion: It Seems

and also led the team in touchdowns
with nine. it was no surprise then
when Halstion was voted the most
valuable offensive player of the
squad for his efforts.

Despite all of these achievements.
however. Halstion took a year off
from the sport that “was taking up
too much of my time and I was spen-
ding too much time thinking about."
But this season. the 5 foot 8 inch I75
lb. halfback is again playing football
for Albany State, and “enjoying it'
more than ever."

"I had to regroup my component
of self," Halstion said, explaining his
one-year layoff front football. “i
spent my year at school trying to
learn about myself and my social

environment. I was so caught up _

into playing football for nearly
fourteen years that I was getting
distracted."

One discipline that Halstion
studied and becatite devoted to was
philosophy. “It aided me a great
deal." Ire said iii the Danes' locker
roont after practice on Tuesday. “I'm
Very content. lcortsider myself to be
a more aware person than I was. I
know there are other things iti life
which are tnttclt better tlratr football.
There are many elements of life arid
football is otin one."

That one element first received
Halstion's attention at the age of six
on the streets of New York City. “A
couple of boys on the block were
throwing the ball around. so I joined
in." he said. "I began to like it and l
stuck with it. (Pause) istarted basket-
ball for a while. but I didn't know
how to dribble the ball."

When l'lillSllUil was l2. he was old
enough to play sandlot football iii
the Buddy Young League. which he
competed in through junior high.

Starting at halfback fit his junior
arid senior years for Brandeis High
School. Halstion considered himself
an average player. He does not have
fond memories of his coaches llrere.

 

“Our coaching staff at Brandeis was
inadequate." said Halstion. “They
were incompetent. But since l‘ve
been here, the coaches have been
adequate and competent. and'that's
one reason why i've been Successful
as a football player here."

On a friend's recommendation.
Halstion came to Albany in 1976.
and was soon “contacted by Ford
who knew he played at Brandeis.
Aside from starting on the junior var-
sity. Halstion. played second-string
for the varsity.

Following his celebrated
sophomore yEar. expectations were
naturally high that Halstion would
continue his success story as a player
at Albany. However. Halstion chose
not to turn the page to Junior Footv
ball Player. He even came close this
year to never reaching that chapter.

"l was still debating whether i
sltould play or not." Halstion reveal-
ed. “But I decided that I didn't watrt
football to retire me. i wanted to
retire football. lknewl had the ability
to get up and walk away from foot—
ball. Not many people have the abili-
ty to do that."

So it was back to the gridiron for
l'falstion, and he was at Albany for
practices when they got underway irr
late August. But thus far. it has been
a frustrating season for Halstion in»
jury-wise ~- one hamstring pull
after another. He barely played
against Southern Connecticut and
was on the sidelines when the Danes
hosted Brockport at Bleeker
Stadium. There have been only
three other contests.

“Sam has had one nagging injury

“I was still debating
whether I should play or
not. But I decided that I

after another." said Ford. "He has
extremely muscular legs and if he's
not stretched otti he has a tendency
to have muscle pulls It's been a pit»
blum for him, but he's
straightening it out."
Ironically. it was a pulled hatiistt
ing two years ago against Hampderr
Sydney in the first round of the
NCAA playoffs that forced lliilSllttii
to sit out the rest of the game turd the
serttilirrals at Widener College. He
was all alone. just I?) yards away
from an obvious touchdown. when
he started to stagger and then full at
the six yard line. accordirtg to
Albany State Sports Infortttatiott
Director Gary Swatlirtg. That was his
last carry with the football in inter-
collegiate competition tttitil 22 ttroti
ths later when the Danes opened up
their 197‘) season at Hobart ttt
September.

Halstion feels he is presently at Hf)
percent capacity. both physically
and mentally. arid "moving towards
90.” he's glad to poirtt out. “lit; the
playoffs I'll be 100 percent." hr-
predicted.

With l-‘ord possessing “the best
stable of backs I've ever had." llalsr
tion. or arty other running back on
the cgth, is not carrying the bulk of
the rt Iring load. Quarterback Terry
Walsh is the leader in running yat'
dage with 304 yards on (t‘) carries.
Behind Walsh is Jack Burger. who
has 40 carries for 284 yards and I.cvr
Louis; 4| rirsht-s for I93 yards. ||.ils
tioti’has lit!) yards on I‘) carries for an
8.2 average. including a 7Ii~yard
touchdown against Buffalo. The

been

Like (July 99 Yards Ago...

Danes' fourth halfback. Dave
Warlteit. has 92 yards on 20 at-
ietnpts.

“You just can't play with two
halfbacks." said Burger. “I think its
good when you can sit out a few
ritinutes and adjust on the sidelines
to something that's happening on
the field." '

Allliortglt Ford calls Halstion “a
helluva player  he believes the in»
juries and the year away frorti foot-
ball have taken their foil. “The year
off was a hindrance to him." Said
Ford "lie started the year not as
sharp as llt‘ would have been if he
plot/ml rl year ago The tliitrg he's
missing is the timing aspect. It takes a
while to get some of that sense back
Spur-d wise and move wise he's pro»
italin where he was

“It has been the injuries as much
its anything else that has tirade Sam
incapable of hecortiitig what he real-
ly cart lit-come. It's still relatively ear-
ly We‘re at the halfway mark."

Reynolds doesn't see any change
in l'lrllSllttiilb blocking ability. “lle's
his head off.‘v said

“I Iv's still a great

blocking
Reynolds
blocker "

“i get tIUth on myself when I
don‘t make it good block atrd I get
down on myself when I don't make rl
good run." said I lrtlstiotr. "I (‘tlitSltlt'i
both to be equal What I like most
about blocking is seeing my opptr
iiettt go down and llu' tittilbrtck girr
ing upfield. I say to myself. ‘ihcrc

did my job."

“Sam's a good 31W “1 I‘dV“
around." said Burger. "We help
each other oitt and we get along
together well "

llalstion is not pressing: he feels
the opportunity will arise to show his
ability as Ire did (it) his touchdown
against Ihtffrtio. “It was on air oitt
Side veer when I scored." llrrlstion
explained. “I didn't think I really had '
the chance to display rrty talents
even their. in essence though. I'm

not rushing anything. There's a time
and there’s a place for everything. I
believe the time will come when the
coaching staff will realize that it's time
for me to get the ball."

That chance could come tomor-
row. and Halstion will be ready. but
riot psyched. “i don't believe in
psyche. I feel that one prepares
himself for a game mentally by going
through certain phases of the game
in practice. First mentally, then
physically. You should take it very
calmly and rationalize things out and
lltt’li go through things aggressive
Iy."

An incident that took place three
years ago iii the first meeting ever
between Albany and Norwich, when
Halstion was on the bench. still
affects him and his feelings toward
the Cadets. “l have a negative
grudge against Norwich in terms of
what they did to my friend Billy
Brown (starting defensive back). It
was a freak accident, but a very
close friend of mine had his leg
broken. Next year. when we played
them. it took me an entire week to
prepare myself for the game,
physically and mentally. Tire feeling
is still there."

llalstioti‘serises a great deal of
team enthusiasm about torttorrow‘s
battle. "We're very up for' it." he
said. “The reason I kttow that is
because there has been a great deal
of spirit at practices this wet-k. I can
tell that the offense is getting ready
because just today (Wednesday) the
backs had a wonderful day."

And what does llrtlstirrrr want iii
his perfortrratin' totiiorrow" “I would
like to have an absolutely perfect
gattte." said the personable llrtls-
"No fitrttbles. arr
blocking grime and an excellent
gaunt in terms of gaining it great deal
of yardage "

Which for the Norwrclr Cadets.
translates into a great deal of that.
old. but still familiar feeling about
