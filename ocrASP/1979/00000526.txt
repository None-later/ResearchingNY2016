It was a year ago at this tinre tliai
the Albany State soccerteam riiadc a
trek to New York City to lace a
highly regarded St. Francis College
team. Despite outplaying ilreir
opponent, a late goal cost Albany a
l-O defeat. Yet they still managed to
earn air NCAA playoff spot.

This year things will be different.
The hooters cannot afford the
luxury of a loss. regardless of how
close the score or how well they play
against visiting St. Francis
tomorrow at 3 pm.

A wiit is essential to their playofl
hopes. It will not only raise their
prestige among the NCAA selection
committee. but also keep tlrcrri away
lroirr a dreaded fourth loss on their
5-3-2 record.

St. Francis is a team that has been
mired in a severe slump for the past
two weeks. Going into an October
I] clash with Oneonta. St. Francis
had steamrolled to a perfect 7-0
record including an impressiye 3-0
wirt over llartwicki Itt addition. they
were rated first in New York State
and among the top It) riaiiorially lll
Dirision I.

A tie with ()ncoirta began a
mysterious slide which has seen their
log drop to 7-2—2. The litst ilel'ettt
was a stunning Z-I upset by lowly
Fordham. followed by a defeat at
ilre hands of a strong Adelphi cliih.

On Wednesday the slide

have turned into their third loss.
Only a Phil Klah goal with ten
seconds remaining in regulation
time prevented a third conseciitiye
defeat.

St. Francis Sports Information
Director Chris Fallon feels she lras
air explanation for the team's
sudden inability to wiii. “Everyone
was up for us becaitse we were
number one. They all played their
best against as."

Sir Francis. like Albany. has had
prohlenis putting the ball iii the net.
They have outshot their opponents
in each game of the slump but have
scored more than one goal only
once.

()n the season. St. l-iancis has
been a verydefensive-minded squad.
'l ltey have allowed as man) as three
goirls only once while recording l'oui
shutouts. This is surprising
considering the fact that Coach Carl
'l'ranrorrto/li starts two sophomores
and a freshman at litllback iii
addition to first year goalkeeper
I)tl\‘tll Palmer.

"'I‘hey play a low key game. Carl
