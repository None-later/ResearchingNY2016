SUC Cortland

Newspaper Is Halted

 

Editors overworked And Overlooked

by Sue Milllgan

The Press. SUC/Cortland‘s
student newspaper. has suspended
publication for the two-week period
extending from October 22 through
November 8 due to “a lack of
student concern." according to
Editor-in Chief Jamie Faricellia.

“We basically had three editors
that were doing all of tire work:
production. writing, editing." said
Fariccllia. “They evett had to
proofread their own copy. We
simply could ttot contintte this arty
longer."

F ricellia believes that the lack of
interest in the strident newspaper is
indicative of general student apathy
on campus. Matty other student
orgam/ations on eamptts are
having the same problem, site said.

“We don't have the atnount of
dedicated people we had last year.
yet we shouldn't need that much
dedication. We shouldn't have to
have people working 40 hours a
week.“ said Faricellia. “We just
don‘t have enough staff. Right now
we ltave no production staff. Ifatty
of the titrcc editors were. not

 

available for one issue. we could not
put 0111 that issue.“
RA Rivals

Faricellia. in her second year as
cditor-in-cbief. feels that the paper
loses many of its potential workers
to the rcsidcrtt assistant program.
which pays.

“We do not pay our workers.“ she
said. “We can't afford to. Many of
the student leaders work as RAs
bccattse it pays. Many students also
must holdjobs. Monelarily. we can‘t
compete.“

The Press. a Zil-page. Weekly
paper. is partially subsidi/cd by
SUCg’Cortlantl's student govern-
ment. The Press must earn Silllilt)
of its $2] .300 annual budget through
advertising. All surplus funds are
tttrned over to the student
government.

“We eattnot afford to go
independent.“ said liaricelliu.

Journalism Dept. No Help ,

The editor cited lack of support
from SUC/Cortland's Department
of Journalism as a major
operational problem of the

newspaper.
