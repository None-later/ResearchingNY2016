The eateries reportedly rent the
TVs to diners at their tables who
then feed the boob tubes coins while
having their dinner so they don‘t

favorite TV shows when they go out

Beatles’ Sult

The Broadway production
"Beatlemania" appears to be in
serious financial trouble following
the filing of a multi-million dollar
lawsuit by the Beatles.

The Beatles filed suit recently in a
Los Angeles court. claiming the
show had damaged their name. The
four entertainers asked the court to
put a stop to the stage show and any
subsequent film versions.

According to the trade paper.
I’urir'ly. two recent performances of
“Beatlemania” were cancelled. and

 

S

the "Beatlemania" stage crew
refused to work unless they were
paid in cash in advance.

The reason for the cash payment
demands are that the crew‘s recent
paychecks have been bonncing.

Variety claims that “Beatle-
mania‘s“ financial troubles were
caused when the Chase-Manhattan
Bank recalled a one and three
quarter million dollar loan to
producers after the announcement
of the Beatles lawsuit.

The show's manager. Bill Sargent.
claims the show will go ahead
despite the recent legal problems.

Prejudice Continues

refused to sign loyalty oaths may

only receive 325.000 each 

‘compensetion from the state.

The six —- five teachers and a
woman whose husband committed
suicide after being fired from the
State Employment Department —
ﬁled a $l.5 million claim against the
State of California for salaries lost
as a result of the dismissals. The
claim was ﬁled under a 1976

- resolution allowing reinstatement

and the filing of claims against the
State.

The California Board of Control.
however. has recommended that a
325.000 “token award" be paid to
each ofthe plaintiffs.Thatamount is
only 10 percent of the total claim
made.

Plaintiff l’hiz Mezey. meanwhile.
a former instructor at San Francisco
State University who lost an
estimated $l79.500 forfeiting to sign
the loyalty oath. has called the
award “shockingly low." And
Vivian Moore. whosL' deceased
husband lost about 5350.000 in
salary. said she was “insulted"by the
offer.
