To be human is to engage in relationships
with others and with the world. Man's
scparnteness from and openness to the world
distinguishes him as a being of relationships.
Men are not only in the world. but also with
the world. Men are not limited to a single
reaction pattern. Men apprehend the
objective data of their reality through
reﬂection — in this act of critical perception
men discover their own temporality. The
dimensionality of time is one of the
fundamental discoveries in tlte history of
ltuman culture.

As men emerge from time. discover
temporality. and free themselves from
"today". their relations with tlte world become

impregnated with consequence. Men catt
intervene in reality in order to eltangc it.

ltttegration results frotn the capacity to
adapt oneself to reality plus the critical
capacity to make choices and transform that
reality. To the extent tltat ntan loses ltisability
to ttta kc choices and is subjected to tltccltoices

of otlters. he is no longer integrated. Rather.
be ltas adapted. Adaptation is a beltaviorttl
characteristic of tire animal sphere. it is
symptomatic of man‘s dehumani/ation.

An historical epoch is characteri/ed by a
series of aspirations. concerns and values in
search of fulfillment. Till: epoclts are fulfilled
to the degree that their tltetttcs arc grasped and
their tasks solved: they are sttperscdetl when
their themes and tasks no longer correspond
to newly etttcrging concertts. llotv men act
upon the reality within tvliiclt these thctnesarc
generated will largely determine their
lttiniani/ation or dchumaui/ation. Only as

men grasp tltc themes catt tltcy intervene itt —
reality. Only by developing a permanently

critical attitude ‘an men overcome a postttre
of adjustment.

To the extent tltat an epoclt dynamically
generates its own themes. men will ltave to
make more and more use of intellectual. and
less and less of emotional and instinctive
functions.

The ordinary person is maneuvered by
myths which powerful social forces have
created. These myths turn against him; they
destroy and annihilate him. Gradually
without even rcaliring the loss. he relinquishes
his capacity for choice; he is expelled front the

Commentary by Hubert-Kenneth D ckcy mi,“ of decisions.

 

A society beginning to move front one
epoch to another requires the development of
an especially l'lexible. critical spirit. Lacking
such a spirit. mcn cannot perceive the marked
contradictions which occur in society as
emerging values in search ofaffirmtition atid
fulfillment claslt with earlier values. Only to
the degree that the choices result from a
critical perception of tlte contradictions are
they real and captible of being transformed
into action. Choice is illusory to the degree it
represents the expectations of others. All
transition involves change: not all change
results in transition. The time of transition
involves a rapid movement itt scttrch of new

themes and new tasks.

Kick In The ASP

To the Editor:

One of the constantly recurring tltcmcs of
the editorial section of the ASP is the lack of
student involvement aitd interest in anything
besides “the partying syndrome". This
commentary reached a minor peak in the
""toher l9editorittl.“A Malicious Proposal"
t.lotttttit..;: Swift is probably turning in his
grttve). Well. the A S'l’hus been successfttl toa
degree itt their crusade. they have ntotivatcd
me to write them.

l atit gettittg sick and tired of opening the
editorial section of this paper and having to
rcttd the moralistic drivel which pours out of
chry issue. I hate to tell you this. bttt no
ntatter how many editorials are written.
people will continue to drittk. take drugs.
sleep with others without having
"commitments". cut classes. attd ltavc sloppy
rooms (Good Lord. what is the world coming
to when students have sloppy rooms?)
Anyone who i: as mttch ofa degeneratcas you
describe couldn't be bothered with reading an
editorial arid certainly wouldn't change their
Iifcstylc because ofit (although they probably
would get a good laugh front it). Of cottrse.
thcr' are people who live for the weekends.

 

 

There are also people who live only for their
work. Neither style oflifc is probablythc best.
It is possible to combine involvement with
partying. l seem to recall something about
Winston Churchill likittg to drittk. And
something about .loltn Kennedy being with
tttany women. llut I guess they \vercjust sick
partycrs who never amounted to anything.

There are many issues the ASP could
concern itself with. Such topics as core
requirements. tlte cottdttct of Albany Police.
the overcrowding in housing. tenure policies
attd many other topics are not discussed itt tltc
ASI’ editorial. Instead. we get to read the

 

moralistic dritcl of an editorial staff which
presumes to be (iod (or at least a lattcr day
prophet). ldon't need some clown to preach at
me. I ttccd to be informed by a responsible
paper which discusses issues intelligently.

Dave Bernot

 

Responsibility cannot be acquired
intellectually. bttt only througlt experience.
As mctt utnplify their power to perceive and
respond to suggestions and questions arising
in their context. and increase their captieitv to
enter ittto dialogue not only with other men
but with their world. they becotttc
"transitive". 'f'rttnsitivity of consciousness
makes man "permeable". It leads him to
replace his disengagement from existence with
almost total engagement. Existence is a
dynamic concept. implying external dialogtte
between man and tnan.

All the Nukes
Fit To Print

To the Editor:

In a recent issue you carried an article
ctttitlcd “Possible l’ciils at Area Nuke Site".
T his article tlcalt with n pluttttcd
demonstration at the Knolls Atomic Power
site.

The organi/ation that is scheduling this
protest made several points with which I
disagree. These people state that "these
reactors routinely t'clcasc low level
radiation ittto the atittosphcrc". i would like
to know what proof there is of this. Wlty
should i bclictc what members ofthis group
say. when. us far as 1 know. they are
ttttqttulilicd to ittakc any statement about
nuclear science other than "I don‘t like it"!
Attotltcr member of this same gt'ottp says that
“If a major ttccidcttl c\ ct'occttrrcd at the pluttt.
tens of thousands of local persons could be
killed." Docs tltis pct'sott actually know any
tnot'c about tlllL‘lL‘tIf cnctgy than what such
well-educated authorities as Jane littnda ltave
toltl him'.’ It is unfottuntttc that these people
will protest anything that includes the word
"nuclear". 'l he pttblic seems to have u
paranoia about such things. lhe public
should be aware that tltc man who tuns the
Navy‘s ttuclcar prograttt has an ttnblctnisltctl
rccoi'd. People migltt be surprised to know
that this tnutt. Admiral llymatt Rickover. is
\cry much dedicated to safety. attd that ltc
doesn‘t think too highly of tltc non-military
nuclear industry cttltcr.

Another point that I would like to contcntl
has to do with the Knolls Trident Action

. t

The student paper at Cortland StatclUniversity has been shut down by its editorsl
because of. they say. lack of student interest. They were sick ofworking hard and late,
missing classes. failing courses. and optioning any chance ofa personal life for their
newspaper. which nobody read. cared about. or probably will even miss. So they say.
They were fed up with criticisms hailed at tltcm by bitter students. irate faculty. and
everyone else. They were dead tired of ptttting up with the constant responsibilityand
pressure. They finally said to hell with this and closed shop. ‘

We can sympathirc with the editors of the Cortland Press. We too are sick of the
work arid the criticisms and the pressure. We sometimes feel like giving it all up and
spending some time with our friends or even studying. We wondcrabout the power of
the press especially when on Tuesday and Friday afternoons the pages of the ASP
swirl around the podium.

Are you reading this'.’ Is anybody rcadittg this page or any page ofthis newspaper. or
any newspaper? Does anybody watch television. or is it simply on and are we in front
of it with ottr eyes staring in its direction? Do people listen to albums? Do we read the
lyrics and understand the dcptlt of meaning in the poetry? Do we see movies? Do we
read books or go through them. cottnting the pages as so many “distances to go?" Do
we listen to teachers. or sit itt their classrooms and cue in on key topics for the mid-
term‘.’ Do we highlight life. underlining only the things which will help us get by'.‘
Sometimes. d ‘ttt' students. brcthren students. it feels like we‘re going through the
motions. Even at the ASP. believe it or not. there are nights when some of its arejust
not iitto it anymore. ()h. we pttt otit tltc paper. We will always put out tltc paper.
whatever happens. But some nights. dear bretltrcn students. some nights . . .

And we wonder sometimes. When we look ittto 'aclt othcr's eyes. what do we see
staring back at tts'.’ Do we ltcar 'ach other? Do we feel for each other? Can we even
sympathiyc with the Cambodians. with the National Guardsmen. with mistreated
students. with the Albany Police. with the editors of the Cortland Press?

How important is the ,AtSI’to your life‘.’ Do you do the crossword puzzle on Fridays.
or read a tnovic review in .‘i.\’/ll't'/.\"f Do you follow tltc Danes. or women's volleyball?
Do you read the ncws‘.’ Personals?

If we didn't come ottt today what difference would it make‘.’ Maybe not much.
perhaps it .t'liou/tln'l. it‘s only a newspaper. But a newspaper is a medium of
communication. It is what gets one id at frotn one person to another. Ideas. facts.
philosophies. theories. opinions. even jokes are transported to thousands. We sltare
ourselves or parts of ourselves with each other through the newspaper. and that‘s what
makes it so important. attd worthwhile to all of us. Even if we know that not everybody
is reading all of us. most people are r 'ading some part of tis. and if we can share one
thought. or cause (my sensation then we have done our job. That is why we are
saddened by Cortlantl‘s loss of their medium of communication. because witnout
communication. without contact with other people. without sharing. then we pass
through life silently and empty and alone. And when we think that We are helping
others to share of themselves. then w ' are satisfied and pttt offusking questions so we
can get to tile tnore important job ofgctting this paper ottt. We will ncvcrstop putting
this paper ottt and despite what happened at Cortland. we ltope and we pray that
people won‘t stop reading. aitd listening. and seeing. attd feeling. attd talking. because.
dear brethren students if we 'an‘t talk to ourselves. who is there left to talk to'.’
