by Mike Williamson .

Last year. the Albany State
varsity wrestling team used a
combination of execllcnt coaching,
dedicated veterans. and talented
freshmen to produce its first wanting
season since 1973-74. This year,
many ofthc names have changed but
the same combination may very well
add up to another wmmng team.

This year's 'coaching staff is
probably as good as that of any
Division III wrestling team in the
country.
In his ﬁrst season as head coach,
Joe DcMeo brings a wealth of
wrestling knowledge to Albany
State. Coach DcMeo's experience
includes coaching the 1976 Olympic
Team. the 1977 PamAmerican
Tcattuand three World Teams. He is
one of two coaches in the entire
country who has coached both
Green—Roman. and .l'irce-Stylc
World 'I cams.

Coach DcMco is ably assisted by
brother John. all All-American at
liracltpnrt. Mikc I’aquelte. an All-

Grapplers Hope To Repeat
Winning Season .With Youth

 

American at local Union College.
and Dean Schlosbcrg who was a
New York State All-Star at
liingltamton.

The returning lettertncn are led by
tri—captuins liowic Burgcr. Mark
Bailey. and Paul Ilornbach.
According to DcMeo. these three
individuals are not only improving
their own wrestling skills. but are
also providing outstanding
leadership to an otherwise young
team. DcMco says there is a definite
feeling at team unity. aml gives
much of the credit for this to his
captains.

llurgcr is expected to compete in
the 134 ll). class. l)ai|c_\ will lit:
competing at 142. and llornhach
moves from the i5ii lb. class (where
he placed 3rd in last year's
SUNYAC championships). to the
I07 lb. weight class.

Other returning lettcimcn include
Nicky (in/man. l)tt\‘c Strauh. Seth
Zamck. and Stcvc Zackch

New faces on the team include
fresluncn Lenny (in/man, Roh

 

Spagnoli. Scott Zamck. and Vic
Herman DeMco ltas high praise for
this group. calling them “as good a
group of freshmen as I‘ve eversecn."
He also pointed out that all four
have excellent attitudes as well as
outstanding wrestling ability.

Coach DcMco sees no problcm in
mixing Albany‘s academic
requirements with a quality
wrestling program. This is not
surprising considering that he
wrestled at Cornell and coached at
Stanford. He secs academics as a
plus.

(ii\‘cn thc quality of built coaches
and wrestlers on this year's team. the
connection between Albany State
and good collcgc wrestling could
soon be equally ohtious.

Ruggers Edge Past   ,,
Settle For Tie At LeMoyne

by Mike Nuclcrio

The Albany State rugby team
closed its season with a 2-1-1 record
following a victory over Albany
Med and a tie with LcMoync
College. '

A long penalty kick by Kenny
Lockhart early in the first half
staked Albany to a 3-0 lead over
Med which the Ruggcrs made hold
up.
Mcd had several scoring
opportunities fall short before the
half but caclt time a tough Albany
defense stopped them short.

The momentum changed in thc
second half with State controlling
thc serum. The Ruggers threatened
several times but couldn‘t manage
another score.

Albany travelled to Syracusc the
next week and played I.eMoync
(‘ollcgc lo a ll-ll deadlock.

The home side took an curly 0-0
lead on a first half try before an
enthusiastic Homecoming Day
crowd.

for the score. Dave Thompson
added the conversion for Albany to
even the count at 6-6.

No further scoring took place
until Albany began a sustained drive
early in the second half. Jack
Ray capped the series with a one.
yard scoring run.and Thompson
again made the conversion to give
the Ruggers a 12—6 lead.

|.cMoyne took advantage of a
defensive lapse by Albany to score
another try and knot the score for
good.

Albany was scheduled to play its
final match of the season last
Saturday at home against Colgate.
However. Colgate failed to arrive.
forcing cancellation of the game.
