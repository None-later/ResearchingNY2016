The Albany State soccer team's
hopes for an NCAA playoff berth
were shattered on Saturday as they
were beaten by Division I St.
Francis, 2-I. The Danes record
slipped to 5-4-2. virtually
eliminating them from contention.

“We didn't play particularly well."
said Albany Coach Bill Schicffelin.
“Part of playing well is not giving the
other team the opportunity to play
well —- which we didn‘t do. We were
slaves of the ball today."

Injuries appeared to play a major
role in Albany’s lackluster play.
“Injuries did hurt us —— we weren't
playing at full strength.“ noted
Schieffclin, “We started the sertson
with l9 players and only t2 oftlicm
are able to play now. Luis Arango
ttnd Vas Serdsev were injured. It
hurls when you lose two starters."

Nevertheless. this was a do-or—die
game for the Danes. They respondetl
with a good effort. but it wasn't
enough against a rebounding St.

slump which saw them go winless in
their last four games. St. Francis
coach Carl Tramontizzi was very
happy with his team‘s performance:
“St. Francis played great. We were
moving the ball and defending tight
and high.“ and he added. “It is too
bad for Albany that they found an
unbelievable St. Francis College
team."

Alberto Giordano. the Albany
goalkeeper and co-captain.
concurred: “They definitely
outplayed us. We tried to comeback
in the second half. but it wasn't
enough. They controlled the ball
much better than we did. We were
lucky they didn't score more goals.“

For most of the first littlfthe two
teams seemed to be evenly matched.
Neither team had a legitimate shot at
a goal as the defenses dominated.
Forward Vas Scrdsev commented:
“They played well. they're a very
skillful team. httt we played a good
gaitic just as well as they did
