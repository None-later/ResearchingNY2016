Terry Walsh’s Two Yard Touchdown Run

The game and Albany‘s
undefeated season were both rapidly

early in the fourth quarter had been
erased by the powerhouse Norwich
offense. and the Cadets had
rocketed to a 25-2f advantage with
nine minutes remaining.

Now there was btit 3: I] left on the

four points. had time for one first
game and possible playoff-saving
drive. With an incredible Norwich

Norwich‘s nation-leading 488 yards
per contest. and less than the Danes
