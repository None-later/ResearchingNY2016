policy three times but have been
denied conferences. according to
Robinson.

"We have been referred to Vice
President of Academic Affairs John
Welsh." Robinson said. “But this is
not an academic issue—it involves
faculty and students. "Only
President O'Leary has the authority
to change a SUNYA policy."

Another letter. dated September
28. was sent to O'l.eary. but the
Alliance was again referred to
Welsh. The group has not yet
TCCL‘lYLLI a response to the letter.

President O'l.cary informed the
ASP that he “has just received the
information"and has not yet studied
it.

"We would like to determine how
(the proposition) related to the
general policies of Affirmative
Action. O‘Lcury said. "We will be
prepared to say (our decision) after
we have studied it."

Alliance Supported
Central Council voted Wednesday
night to support the Alliance in its
efforts. The Council and the

Alliance are urging President 0-
Leury to include the clause. and are
asking for support from the entire
University.

“Many professors are subtly
avoiding the subject of homo-
sexuality in their classes" Robinson
said. "They do not mention the fact
that many famous historical
figures—such us Michelangelo“
were guy. The university
supposedly an institution dedicated
to ﬁnding the truth. is hiding the
truth. We are livinga lic.and it hurts
everyone. Human rights apply to
everyone.“

Al'firmatit c Action has been "very
supportite and interested."
according to Robinson.“but there is
very little they can do at this point."

“The job of Affirmative Action is
to handle infringements of the
existing anti-discrimination policy “
said Robinson. "But since we are not
protected. there is little they can do.
EVcn if we were explicitly told to
leave a dorm. for instance. because
ofsexual preference. there is nothing
Affirmative Action could do
because of the policy.“

C‘orning‘s response to a "no limit"

Corning also responded to
questions regarding strident voting
rights, stating while they are not
considered Albany residents.
students should have voting status.
“The law is pretty damn clear that
they have the right to vote. whether
they are in college or at home.“ he

“I've had nobody come to me and

In response to the recent acquittal
of Albany police officers Michael
Buchanan and Richard Vita.
(‘orning said that the charges
against them would be “vigorously”
pursued.

“When a police officer has been

is a matter of very great concern."he
said. .

He added. however. that the
majority of Albany police officers
are “darn good cops."

When asked if he considered

Corning said. “l haven‘t the vagucst

Robinson hopes also to gain the
support of the University Senate in
urging President O‘Leary to include
the clause in SUNYA's anti-

“The policy must be extended"

said Robinson. “It's a fundamental

part of civil libertiés."

But Silton feels that the most
important things SUNYA students
can bring away from the vigil are A
commitment and a memory.

"For the people who participate
they will be able to tell their
grandchildren that when they were
confronted with a problem. that
