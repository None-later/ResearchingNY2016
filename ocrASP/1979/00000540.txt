Smokin’ Coke

A Yale University‘psychiatrist

. and pharmacologist is warning that

the smoking of cocaine could
become a significant health problem
in the United States.

Dr. Robert Byck says he is
concerned about reports that some
users of the popular white powdery
drug are beginning to use it in much
more concentrated form.

According to Byck. some coke
users — particularly in California —
are converting street cocaine to “free
baSe." a material similar to coca
paste which can be smoked in a pipe.

Byck claims that when smoked in
paste form. the cocaine is quickly
absorbed in very high levels in the
blood. similar to the effect of an
intravenous injection.

He claims the levels are so high.
they produce intense euphoria
followed rather quickly by anguish
and depression. To offset the
reported depression. Byck says.
users continue to smoke more.
leading to dependency on the drug.

llyck says that for 2000 years.
Indians in South America chewed

coca leaves without any apparent
adverse health effects. However. he
adds. serious psychiatric problems
have occurred among South
American coke users over the past
three or four years after the
techniques for smoking cocaine
paste were developed.

Byck says he is disturbed by
advertisements in US magazines
promoting chemical kits for
converting street cocaine to “free
base" and for ads for pipes used in
smoking cocaine.

Space Simulator

A New York City film producer
has announced plans for two new
38-scat theaters that scund like
something out of Buck Rogers.

According to Joseph Strick: the
two theaters will be large-scale
copies of a NAS spaceflight
simulator. ‘

Strick says the theaters will screen
specially-produced films which
simulate flights in outer space. The
two screening rooms will reportedly
be mounted on coniputcrircd
hydraulic supports which will move
the audience in harmony with
motions of the space ships being
shown on the screens.

Since the movements are said to
be a bit scary. each customer will
undergo a brief “prc-flight"
medical exam before being settled.
The space whrks location in New
York. Strick says. should be open by
