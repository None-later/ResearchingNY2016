Human beings are human because they
exist in and with the world. This existing
implies a permanent relationship to the world
as well as an action on it. This world. because
it is a world of history and culture. is a world

of men and women-not simply a world of

“ “nature”.

> We‘must have a clear and lucid grasp ofour
‘action whether we wish to or not. Instead of
the mere "doxa"ofthe action we perform. we
must go right to its “logos ". That is the speciﬁc
task of philosophical reﬂection. The role of
this reﬂection is to react to the action and to
reveal its objectives. its means. and its
efﬁcacy. If there is no dichotomy between
theory and practice. reﬂection on our action
reveals the theory-without which the action is
not a true one. The practice. in turn.acquires
new signiﬁcance when it is illustrated by a
theory.

Anti-dialogue and dialogue are embodied
in contradictory forms of action. Thus the
factor which distinguishes an action of anti-
lialogue cannot be a constitutive element of
an action of dialogue and vice versa.

For anti-dialogue to be effectiVe. and for it
to attain its objectives. the action must be

Thus anti-dialogue presupposes conquest.

nullify its form and encourages massification
(dehumanization and alienation).

True humanism. which serves human
beings. annotaccept manipulation underany
name whatsoever. For humanism there is no
path other than dialogue. To engage in
dialogue is to be gcunine. Dialogue cannot
imprison itself in any antagonistic
relationship. Dialogue is the loving encounter
of people. who mediated by the world.
"proclaim" that world. They transform the
world and in transforming it. humanize it for
all people. 1 scncountcr in lovccannot he an

instead of problem-posing dialogue. we
seem hopelessly locked intothe subjugation of
the student to the text. the reading of which
has to be “controlled.”

Only within diuloguc ttnd problem-posing
can ed ucutor-cducatcc and ed ucatce-educator
go forward together to develop the necessary
interplay of knowledge. and the resulting
critical perception.

An ASP of a
Different Color

To the Editor:
' ODE TO THE ASP

_How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways:

Twice a week I can catch up on some ofthe
big issues of the day when time precludes me
from reading the New York Times.

Twice a week I am informed about the
opinions. messes and successes of SUNY
Albany.

Twice a week I am offered a variety of
different ways to stimulate my mind. body
and wallet.

Most of all Dear ASP

I appreciate the qualityjournalism and care
that goes into each Tuesday and Friday
edition.

After all. the weekends would never come
to anything without the ASP.

A Secret Admirer

To Err is Human. . .

o the Editor:

The JSC-Hillel has raped the Constitution
by usurping the basic right of trial by jury.
They have chosen to lead a destructive path of
persecution with a complete and utter
disregard of human decency. This wanton
miscarriage of justice is being funded by the
students of this institution of higher
education.

Thc JSC-Hillel has denied a person the
basic assumption of innocence until he is
proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
This SA funded organization plans to
mobilize a force of self-ingratiating
individuals to a suburb of Albany to facilitate
an emotional issue to subjugate him to
humiliation. degradation. and embarrass-
ment in front ofhis family and neighbors. This
move will only serve to castigate a man. who
has not yet been proven guilty. It is abhorrent
that this is the manner JSC-Hillelchose to stir
memories of a tragic and dark era in the
history of mankind.

With the vast resources of JSC-Hillel. one
would think that a more mature reminder of
the Holocaust could have been conceived. A
more tasteful presentation of the grotesque
atrocities of the Nazi‘s reign in Germany
would have been more appropriate than
publicly demeaning a resident by staging a
demonstration in front ofhis suburb home as
if he was convicted and proven guiliy of war
crimes. This brins back sad memories ofthe

McCarthy era and Salem witch hunts.

It can only be hoped that JSC-Hillcl. an
SA-funded organization. will reassess its
sponsdrship of this butchering of the right to
human dignity. Accusations must not be
equated with convictions. For. ich allow this
to happen. who knows where it will stop? we
do not mean to defend a Nazi war criminal.
but rather to defend a higher concern ‘
justice for all!

To Forgive is Divine

To the Editor:

Several weeks ago. We read an
announcement in the ASP about holding a
vigil outside the home ofan accused Na/i war
criminal. At ﬁrst. we didn't know whether to
take the article seriously. but We finally
decided that it wasn't something that people
joke about. We feel such actions are too
extreme. unfair. and unnecessary. and
consequently we went to speak to sctctttl
members of JSC-Hillel.

We are. by no means. justifying \\it;tl
happened in Nazi Germany. The alleged
criminal. Villis Hazners. is charged mth
dcportability. and faces war charges in lit-t
other countries. Legal proceedings haw
already begun as to whether or not he should
be deported. and the proper authoritie lllL'

witnesses alledged that they sun iiillllch

and murder. However. these ill't.‘ ultl‘.
allegations. not necessarily realities.

On the fact sheets. handed to us ht .l
member of JSC-Hillel. one oftlieir tlhjct‘llhjs
was to bring this man‘s scncc to the
"attention of those who supp tjustice“ \Hlll
the expectation that “he will be dealt \ttth
fairly under the law". We seriously question
whether holding a vigil outside this man“.
home will present a fair and unbiased pletqu
to his neighbors and other Ctlnlmtlttlh
members. not to mention that it Will inttudc

He has been in our country for thirty ycllts.
and there is no evidence to cause us to hcltctc
that he~wishes to recreate the past. We don't
belich we have the right to passjudgment on
this individual or to sway and influence the
community with allegations. There are mun)
other ways in which to inform society n1
things that are currently happ ning. \\':
should allow our legal system to give this man
a fair and unbiased trial. and the courts should
determine the appropriate actions tot Us. the
