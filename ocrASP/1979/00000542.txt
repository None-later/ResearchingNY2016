The Editor’s Aspect

Music is the liberation of the soul. It is supreme
ecstasy, divine inspiration. it releases us from mundane
perceptions of the world and, through perfect.
symbolism. it connects us to our own emotions and
thoughts. Music is love (Stevie Wonder, Liszt),‘ahd
passion (Bach, The Who), and angertElvis Costello),
and anxiety, fear, hatred, despair (Billie Holiday). Music -
enraptures the scope of human experience more
vigorously than any other art. The other arts, as sublime
as they are, can only imitate life, music recreates it!

7 But of all the arts, music is most restricted by business.
Popular songs are manufactured to sell as many copies
as possible. Elaborate“ advertising “and promotion
seduces the publicto like songs. Of all‘artists itis hardest
for the musician to retain his artistic integrity ’o‘ver'the
pressures of . commercialization; - Even worse than
Hollywood screenwriters of the 19405 the current
musicians prostitute‘ tihemselves

The Music Industry COnspires to- cbnstrict art by
making music-to—order. Records are mass-produced
with factory-like precision and artists are programmed to
comply. With few exceptions only the artists who can
