of his problem would lead him on an infinite
search for a solution. He was bewildered. His
hands covered his face as he moaned. He'
thought. ‘How could i have done it?’ The

and grabbed his 'coat. The echoes of his

quickly dropped a live on the bar and called
for a tap. A sigh of relief greeted the beer car-
rying bartender. The first sip of the golden car-
bonation helped to case his trembling body.
He closed his eyes and let his frazzled mind
rest. He hadn't slept in a (layvanda h‘plf and
desperately needed relief' from "his lrnental.

the cold. stark reality of his beer glass. "What

change from the bar and exited. Outside he
reached Into his pocket and lit a cigarette. The
feeling of the smoke in his lungs cleared his
mind. He felt a bit calmer and more secure.
The cigarette burned. He walked to Assilla's.
The calmness was abnormal from his recent
mental unrest. ;'
Rounding the corner onto Univere Blvd.
he ﬂicked his butt. He was only a half a block
from his destination. The alcohol from the
night before was finally starting to clear from
his head. The total hassle of sobering up for
the police. Trying to make his prefabricated
description of the night before seem realistic. it
was horrifying. The smashed car. the strobing
red police light and his mind. trying to account
for everything. He almost didn't believe he'd

and sped up the stairs to apartment 207. He
opened the unlocked door and stepped in-
side. :

 Assilla. startled by-the'so'und.‘ turned and
approached him. With eager. concerned eyes
she asked "What happened? You look like a
wreck." He sensed her concern gio'w rapidly
upon seeing his condition. He moved evasive-
ly at first and then finr‘ly relaxed on the couch.

He felt at ease now. He knew that talking to
Assilla wouldn't be )ust a verbal ejaculation to
case his mind. This was it. No more fitter-
tatter. this would straighten out his head.
Balance and reality defined.

"Last night . . . " he uttered.

His mind was stumbling. He restarted. “it
was horrible. Bill and l were in an accident.
Bill's car is wrecked." He leaned back and
closed his eyes. He could feel the coiled ten-
sion In his mind begin to unwind.

Her mind raced for a moment. Then she
asked. "is he hurt?"

“No.”

Her mind scrambled. she grabbed two
glasses and some scotch. “Now relax and just
tell me what the hell happened."

The burn of the scotch gave him the
perseverence to continue. "Last night Bill and
1 went out. We were In need of a good rip to
get the week off our minds._ You know how
we get on Fridays." The words came easier
now. "1 had some ludes so we gobbled them
before we went to Manny's party.

' Being that she knew Bill and Hal and was a
sharp girl. .she began to put the pieces
together. “Those luck-offs.=_" she thought.

  
   

. ‘ Marty V'u kovrch
She'd always figured it would happen even-
tually.

"We were having a great time. Drinking and
smoking. Everyone was there. We stayed until
four. We were fucked-out of our brains. On
the way home the car got wrecked."

it all sounded so predictable. She was stir-
red. though. by the fact that she saw an
uneasiness that still resided in his eyes. She
noticed the tension as he' took another quick
sip of scotch. “What's wrong. Hal?" she asked
in that open way that would always release his

innermost thoughts to her. She looked him in.

the eyes.

"As we left Manny's 1 asked Bill to wait while
1 look a leak. When l got back to the car. Bill
had fallen asleep. 1 tried to wake him. but it
was no use. The key was in the ignition so 1
just dragged him onto the'passenger side and
started the car. Everything was fine. Bill snor-
ing contentedly as l buzzed down Stewart
Ave. The sireetlights glistened and the music
played. 1 was amazed at how easily We moved

.‘down the road. Then 1 don't know what ever

"came me. The' Pink Floyd started to captivate
my mind. it started to drift on those slow.
melodic harmonies. its beauty totally removed
me from reality. Then smash. all 1 could see
was white. it was a few minutes before l got a
grip on things. Bill was still unconscious. I
dragged him out of the car. 1 shook him. trying
to make him show signs of life. My mind
started to expand like an atom bomb ex-
ploding. I thought my head was going to
pop." He was shaking now. Showing signs of
relapsing to that previous horror.

She steadied him. "Take it easy. man." She
lit a cigarette for him. He began to inhale it

, deeply. After a few drags he was calm enough
to continue. “Go on." she said.

"1 was Just about to freak out when this lady
in a housecoat grabbed me. She saw right
through me. She asked If 1 was alright. I
couldn‘t speak. 1 sat there with a blank terrified
stare on my face. While she ran over to Bill I
collapsed on the ground. Crying like a baby i
tried to wish that it wasn't really happening.
Then some bluecoat grabbed me. 1 locked up

and saw flashing red lights all over the place.
My mind started racing. I swear l was thinking
a thousand things at once. i was so relieved
when 1 saw that Bill was alive but still in-
coherent."

“Oh my God! You must have been flipping
out. All those cops wanting to know this.- that
and the other thing." She looked at Hal with a
puzzled face. There was more tension now.
Her mind took a twist. The questioning look
on her face demanded Hal‘s continuance.

“1 can't believe 1 did It."

She became intensely intrigued. "Did
what?" Hal trembled for a moment. Then
blurted it out. "i told them Bill was driving."
He brokedown.

She looked at him. Now everything was
beginning to (make sense. She now
understood what his mind had gone through.
He had passed the blame all and his cons—
cience wouldn't stand for it. Her arm slowly
went around his shoulder and she gave him a
comforting hug. He was broken and she knew
it. After a while of rocking in her arms she
said. "Come on. Pick up your head. Let's 9)
make some coffee." With his now slight inntr
strength he rose to his feet and followed her
into the kitchen wiping his eyes. His breathing
calmed a bit and reality began to focus in h‘s
mind again.

He savored that first sip of coffee. That
magic brown caffeinated liquid that gives one
a little boost whenever necessary. He was star-
ting to feel real again. He knew who he was.
what he did and what he had to do. He could
again look Into Assilla’s eyes as a respectable
human being with that special honesty that
was theirs. They smiled at each other. As he
drank the coffee the glow of life began to In-
vade his body. He finished his coffee and rose.
Picking up the phone he dialed the police sta-
tion and asked for the officer-handling the
case. " i  2» '

“Officer Harris." the receiver answered at
fast.

"This is Hal." M:

"How are you feeling?” was the immediate
reply. '

"Alright. 1 have to tell you something."

"What?"

"1 was the driver last night. not Bill. 1 don't
know why I said he was."

“1 see." said Harris. "Well you can-come
down tomorrow and we'll change the report."

“O.K. Goodbye."

As he placed the phone down a newenergy
filled his body. His mind was free again to
function normally. No more inner conﬂict
putting his mind to such unrest. "they strolled
into the livingroom and sat down on the
couch. “Can ’ya roll up a joint for me?" Hal
asked. She smiled and obliged happily. She
was warmed inside knowing how much better
he fell now. As he smoked the joint he found
tranquility. The internal conflict was resolved.
His mind was at rest. He closed his eyes and
let his mind drift freely in his mental peace.-
