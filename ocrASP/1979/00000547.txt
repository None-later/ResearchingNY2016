problem. First of all. making all Wellington

attempted last year and was disastrous for the
following reasons: either the scheduled

appearance. or by the time a bus did arrive
there were three times as many people and

Likewise. abortion affects another body —
that of the child. The child is not part of the
mother's body: from the moment of
conception ii is a separate individual with its
oWn unique genetic structure. To claim that
the child is part of the mother‘s body is to
claim that a woman's body hastwo heads. two
hearts. four arms. four legs. and in some cases
male sex organs! Obviously the child‘s body is
separate from that of the mother. and no
woman has the right to destroy a body which
is not her own.

“The quality of life“ was something Ms.
Miccio expressed concern about. The quality
of life cannot be very high in it society so
intolcnint and oppressive that it kills ti child
simply because he is handicapped. because he
is of the "wrong" sex. or because one woman
does not want lilm. even though thousands of
couples would gladly adopt him.

The right-to-lifc movement does not seek to
oppress worrien through “compulsory
pregnancy“ and “mandatory inothcrhood.“as
some pro-uboriionisls claim. No one compels
a woman to become pregnant. and no one
mandates that she keep and raise her child
after he is born. However. she and her partner
do have a responsibility to protect the life of
the child they have conceived through their
iiwn actions. rather than escaping

personal feeling that should not affect 'any other considerations being made on
someone. be it for a job or otherwise.

Discrimination on the basis of sexual and attcctionat preterences is as unjust as any
other form of unrelated. insubstantial bias. It is an excuse to mistreat those who simply
do not share an accepted standard.
Gays have been discriminated against for long enough. It is good to see that finally.
some steps have been taken to insure that gays receive the same treatment as others.
and can feel freer to reveal their preferences without the worry of complete rejection.
However. these steps have been small ones. and much more must be done to give gay
people equal treatment for jobs. for the military. and for their freedom of choice.
At this campus. some measures are being taken by the students on Central Council
to prevent further discrimination against gays. The current Affirmative Action plan
does not include nondiscrimination due to sexual or affectional preferences. and
President O'Lcary has the right to amend that. We wholly support the Resolution
passed at Central Council last Wednesday calling on the President to amend the
Affirmative Action plan. and stop the gross discrimination and unequal treatment
being implemented on gay students and faculty members.
it is inexcusable that its it stands now. gay professors can be denied tenure on the
basis of such an unrelated. subjective thing as individual preference. Something must
be done. and on this campus. that something should be amending the Affirmative
Action plan now. ’
‘ Gay people have had to stay in the closet long enough. The time has come to stop

relying on subjective "truths" and the vtilucjudgmcrits ofu scared majority. Man is a
diverse creature. and the acceptance of that underlies an open mind to the differences
Iamong individuals that will undoubtedly dcvclop. We must openly accept those
differences. even be thankful for them. and go on with the leeling that. as the sixties
said. everyone must indeed do their very own thing.

District Chairman of the party are all women.
It is the pro-abortion movement which is
sexist. for it gives men no rights in deciding
hether their own children will live or die.
Also false is Ms. Micclo's statement that the
arty opposes contraception and so
education. It takes no stand at all on
contraception. and several party members
reach sex education courses.
Ms. Miccio falsely accused the party or
opposing welfare and social services. and of

 

fundamental right: the right to live.
