two touchdowns last week.

“They‘ve changed their
philosophy of :nsivcly.“ said
Carncvalc. "They now have a hcttcr
balance hctwccti passing and
running. and both their
quarterbacks can run tttid pass the
hall."

One area ol’uticcrtttiiity for ltlitica
is their specialty teams. I tlst neck
the lionibcrs uscd three-punters and
too kickers. and no single player
seemed to stand ottt.

A factor that could play it pttrt iii
tomorrow‘s outcome is last year's
contest. Ithaca was a Iiiglt-llyittg
squad tttitil the Duties shocked them
on Aratigo's 45-yard field goal iii the
closing minutes. and it was a dclcat
for thc llotnhcrs that was seen on

"Last year‘s experience was
positive because our kids tiow
believe that they can hctit Ithaca.“
