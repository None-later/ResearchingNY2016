One Year Later, The Playoffs Are Still At Stake I

 

Ranked Seventh In The Nation, Danes

Face Ithaca With Key Starters Injured

by Paul Schwartz

Rarely does a situation reverse
itself so exactly from one y -ur to the
next as tomorrow‘s confrontation
between Albany and Ithaca. The
two squads Iiavc interchanged last
season's roles. the game location has
changed. and the physical condition
of the teams has also remarkably
been switched. And one other
element has remained constant in its
turnaround: A victory for Albany
would virtually lock their bid for an
NCAA Division III playoff hid.
while a win by Ithaca would keep
them in contention for a sclcctioti.

A year ago. the Danes entered
their rcgionally-tclcviscd tnatclitip
with Ithaca posting a 5-2 mark. This
season. Albany is itride i'atcd with a
per '

 

 

feet Ml .slatc. Ithaca currently
shows a 6-2 record. hilt last year they
were the club to come itrto Albany‘s
Illccckcr Stadium with no It—() mark.
The most telling factor in
tomorrow‘s otttcomc. though. could
be the injury factor. A year ago it
was the Iioinlu'rs that it etc forced to
play without live starters. and this
season. it is the Danes that will limp
into Itlutca‘s South Ilill Iiicld.

For the first tintc ever. this week
Albany did not suit up in pads fora
Tuesday practice as injuries suffered
against Norwich a week ago began
to show. Two Danes. defensive end
Matt Ilrancato and kicker Dario
Arango. will definitely be sidelined
against Ithaca. both having sprained
ankles. Sal Iridelicttto will start in
place of llrancato and Mike
Levenstcin will handle the kicking
against Ithaca. Albany quarterback
Terry Walsh. coming off a line
performance last week. is an
extremely doubtful starter. Walsh
has a contusion of the thigh. and as
ofThursday. he was not able to run.
Mike Fiorito. who has seen limited
game time so far this . on. will
start at quarterback if Walsh is
unable to go. I-Ialfbitck Sam
Ilalstion will ‘

 

 

     
   

 
   

sidelined with a reiujured hamstring.
and defensive ' halfback Daryl
llaynor is questionable with :r groin
pull. .Ioe Raj/cak. one of Albany's
starting corncrbacks. has a bruised
shoulder. bill is expected to see
action in Ithaca.

The sudden rash of injuries came
shortly after the Danes rccciicd
encouraging news from too
Division III polls. After last week's
Iii-25 \ictory over Norwich. Albany
moved tip to the third position iii the

unexpected move was the Danes

ranking in Albany football history.

“()l'coirrse I was pleased with the

Despite owning a 6-2 record. the
Iiombcrs lll|\' ' a solid claim to their

On offense. the Ilombers Iiave

Late Goal Gives Boaters Tie

by Larry Kahn

In a game characteri/ed by
shoddy. non-aggressive play. the
Albany State soccer team ended
their season by barely niaiiaginga l-
I lie with lowly RI’I. on Wednesday.
“We plrtycd very poorly." notctl
Albany ('oach Iiill Schicffcliri."l{l’l
was the weakest learn we faced all
ye r. We rctili/cd \vc weren‘t going
anywhere and wc let down. Our
teamwork wasn't good zit all today."
Alberto (iiordnrio. tlic Dunc

 

‘goalkccpcr and co-captuitt. agreed:

"We didn‘t take the game seriously.
Since it was the last game til tltc year
\\t.‘ decided to just go ottt and lltt\L'

'Iltc outconic ol tlrc garrrc itscll

Saturday and Rl’l is going nowhct'c
with it dismal 4—5-l record. “We
'ltckctl a little tltivc ltlllll)’->\\’C
couldn‘t inttstcr tip enough
enthusiasm." said Schicflclin.

Right from the start of the gatiie.
Albariy seemed to be, just laying

hack on defense. letting the weaker
RI’I team control the pace of the
game. RI’I took the offensive and
overcamc Albany‘s superior style by
outliustling them with a swarming
aggressive offense. The strategy
payed oil as RI’I scored quickly.
Alberto (iiordano nuid' a diving
strip of a low shot to the right-hand
corner of tilt: net. biit Driewiriski
slammed tlic rebound Iiornc at4:2(l.
"I should have had that ball."
admitted (iiordrtno. “Iiiit we should
have scored at Icitst 3 or ‘1 goals. We
were shooting a lot. bill they were
easy slttils. We didn‘t test their
goulkccpci' :it all."

lhc Danes were stunned by the
early goal and by tltc cud ol'thc first
llilll thcy were getting the
penetration into the RP] dcl'cnsc.
but they couldn‘t get off a
rcspcctoblc shot on goal. Time after
timc. after bringing the ball
ilotvrificld. they would shoot weakly
at the goalkeeper or drive the brill 20
feet over tltc goal.

Albanycontrolled the ball most of
the second half. bttt still coirldri‘t

cash in on their opportunities.
Forward Afrim Neraj.was kicked in

As time started
Albany hccarnc desparate. They

captain Robert Dahab bounced one
