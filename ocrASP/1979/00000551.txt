Students Protest in
Accused Nazi’s Home

Waving anti-Nazi posters and
carrying Holocaust memorial
candles, close to ﬁfty SUNYA
students and Albany residents stag-
ed an hour-long demonstration
'Sunday, outside the home of accus-
ed Nazi war criminal'ViIis Hazners.

SUNYA's Jewish Students’
Coalition USO-Hillel, which spon-
sored the event, transported people
by bus to Hazner's home in
Dresden, New York. The group
walked approximately a quarter of
a mile on an isolated road to' the
house, where they rallied in an ef-
fort to precipitate action on
Hazner's case.

Hazners was not at home. A
source revealed that the 74-year~old
Latvian national was forewarned
about the vigil by a SUNYA stu—
dent.

Although ncvcr convicted of war
crimes. Hazners has been charged
with sending Jews artd other
mittoritics to death camps of pre-
'World War ll Latvia. In addi-
tion to charges of physical abusc. ltc
has been held responsible for her-
ding masses of Jews into a
synagogue in the Latvian town of
Riga, before setting it on fire.

After being charged with depor-
tability under the Immigration and
Nationality Act and the Refugee
Relief Act. deportation preceedings
were begun against Hazners in
1977. Hazners apparently presented
false information on his entry visa,
thus enabling him to enter the
United States. His trial continued
for two years with post-trial briefs
filed by each side three months ago.

Led by coalition leaders,
demonstrators recited speeches,
songs, and prayers which depicted
the pre-war Holocaust era and
reﬂected concern over the possible
presence of other alleged criminals
in the area.

In addition, pallbearers carried a
simulated cofﬁn. rcprescnting the
l2 million who died in the war by
Nazi persecution. Thc cofﬁn was
placed at the entrance of Hazncrs'
driveway, with 13 memorial candles
placed on top.

Throughout the ceremony.
students scrubbed the asphalt with
toothbrushes, an act symbolizing
Nazi punishment inﬂicted on.chs.
According to JSC-Hillcl President
Mark Gurvis, Jews were subject to
beatings while involved in this ac-

Election Results Favor Albany Democrats

 

Albany Democrats Gain
Local Election Success

by Pat Branley
and Peter Berezny
As expected, Albany County
Democrats were victorious in local
elections last night. ﬁlling four ma-
jor executive branch seats.
Democrats triumphed in County
Executive, County Comptroller,
County Clerk, and Shcriff races.
“it looks like a great election to
me." said Mayor Erastus Corning
early Tuesday night. Corning
refitted Albany County Republican
Party Chair George Scoringe's
claim that the Republicans would
win back the three County
Legislative seats they lost in 1975.
“My guess will be that they won‘t
succeed." Corning said. “it will be
about the same number of
legislative scars, maybe we‘ll gain
one." He added that nothing could
be guaranteed “until tltc results are

in.’!/

In a strong campaign for County
legislative scats, Republicans gained
five. Sixteen Republicans and 23
Democrats now make up thc Court-
ty Legislature. the number causing
the Dcmocrats‘ loss ofthc two-third
majority in tile legislature.

In 1975, tltc Republicans lost the
24th. 25th. 26th legislative districts
in Colonic, leaving the Republicans
and Democrats with ll and 28
legislators rcspcctivcly. A strong
Republican campaign was led itt
Colonic itt ltopcs of winning back
the seats.

Gaining Republican seats at a
local level was necessary to block
the Dcmocrats' two-third legislativc
majority needed for passing bond
issues.

County Sheriff candidate
Democrat George lnfantc won the

election. beating Republican can-
didate Lady Rucinski by a 9.500
margin. lnfante. Corning‘s
"handpicked choice." is not a
registered Democrat.

"l'nt not sure if I’ll register after
the clcction." said lnfan'tc. He add-
cd that he would not jeopardize his
professional reputation by allowing
political considerations to stifle his
duties.

lnfantc wants to profcssionalize
the Sheriff's Department. and plans
to irtcrcasc training, as well as study
thc department for purposes of im-
provcment.

lncuntbcttt Democrat James J.
Coync will serve his sccond tcrm as
Albany County Executive, as he
won the race with 67,353 votes to
Republican candidate Smith‘s
29,099 votes.

Smith campaigned for stronger
cxccutivc powers and thc rigltt for
tire County Executive to hirc
department heads. Coync sup-
ported Smith's cffort,but said work
was needed. “The first two years

Rep. Torraca Wms Justice Seat

by Aron Smith

NEW l’AL’l‘Z~—A smiling Joseph
Torracn lcft Ulster County
Republican l‘lcudqunrtcrs ltcre last
night grasping at victory, yct fillcd
with unccrtninly. The Republican
cnndidntc for state Suprcmc Court
justicc shook the ‘usual hands and
cndurcd the endless applause in—
cvilnbly associated with election
night drinking, before treading 15
miles north to Kingston and ntorc
clcclion returns.

'l'orrncn made mnny such trips
Inst nigltt. Distance was inherent in
the very nature of his campaign; the
third judicial district is spread over
seven counties from thc mid-
l-ludson valley to the Adirondacks.

Long Llistnnccs scrvcd as a major
obstnclc which 'l‘orrncn had to over-
come in the course of his bid. While
six years as lilstcr ('ounty district
attorney plltL‘L'tl him vcry much iii

the public eye in tltc Ncw l’nltz-
Kingston area. Torraca remained
virtually unknown in tire Capital
District.

Torraca resorted to a costly
media blitz irt Albany and Troy.
Tltc candidate llopcd that by
plastering his face to every nvuilablc
pillar. a certain nnmc rccognition
might develop arid neutralize the cf—
fcct of thc popularity of opponents
from the region.

Apparently the strategy worked:
Torracn emerged with 26.l76 votes
in Ulster County, some 3,000 votes
more titan his nearest opponent. A
second Supreme Court justice scat
was won itt Ulstcr by fcllow
Republican Lawrcncc Kaltn with a
total of 23,000 votcs. Democrats
and conscrvativcs received the short
end of this election. tallying from
730 to less than 100 votes.

"Joc ('l‘orruca) will bring to the

bench the qualities that you look

for in sornconc in the capacity of

Supreme Court justice,“ said
Dominick Sfrcgola, ortc of 'l‘or-
rnca‘s staunchcst supporters. “Hc
has the ability to mclc out a fair
justice. yet a strong justice. He put
togclhcr and run it most effective
campaign.”

The final results of Torraca's
cxpcctcd to bc

campaign are
available sometimc today.
However, tltc tabulaling process

has been slowcd somewhat by thc
itnpouttdirtg of voting machines in
areas with close races.

“l'tn very conservative. l don't
like to be optimistic," said Tort‘ncn
curly this morning. “You have to
remember l'm running in seven
counties. it’s too soon to conjecture
what the seven-county total will be.
But if New l’altz is any indication,
it looks like it's two to one."

 

Repubs Lose County Races
Incumbents Sweep Contests

by Laura Florentine
and Beth Sexcr

f‘he Republicans were defeated
by tile Democrats in all four major
cottnty offices last night.

The county offices of executive
Comptroller, and Clerk were lost by
chublicans to incumbent
Democrats. The position of Sheriff
was also lost by a slim margin, to
the Democratic contender.

However. the Republicans made
successful gains in the office of
County Legislator. Of the 39
available seats, l3 were won by
Republicans. This constitutes one-
lhird of the county legislature, a
margin sufficient to significantly
strengthen tltc party's power.

According to Associated Press
wire reports this represents a 2 seat
gain for the Republicans over the
previous tcrm.

Succcssful in his county
legislature reelection bid.
Republican l’uul Scaringc l'ccls il
will be a “hindrance to work with a
majority of Democrats."

in what was probably tltc hottest
rrtcc among Albany County cx-
ccutivcs, Republican Lady Rucinski
was defeated by a small margin in
her bid for the county sheriff post.
Rucinski‘s defeat by democratic op-
poncrtt George L. lnfantc did not
come until late results came in front
her hometown of Colortic.

in her conccssion spccch Rucin—
ski wished her opponent “all suc-

cess” and added that she still
thought that she “did the best she
could".

chinski said that her feelings
were best expressed in a sentence
taken from a letter sent to her by a
friend: “When soldiers are on the
line they have tears in their eyes
when they shouldn’t."

Rucinski acted as superintendent
of the Albany County Jail and
Penitentiary from 1977-1979, and
Deputy Superintendent from 1975
to I976.

in a landslide . victory,
Democratic incumbent James
Coyne kept the county executive
position away from‘ Republican
Phyllis A. Smith.

Smith cited- an “identity crisis”
as one of the major problems of ltcr
campaign and an important cause
of her defeat.

“l have had no previous political
cxpcricncc and am virtually a
political unknown," she said. “By
serving onc tcrnt itt office, my op—
ponent has gained a following."

Smith believes many changes are

called for in Albany County
government, and that ~ relevant
change will not occur urtdcr

Coync's leadership.

“James Coync is just 2: Charlie
MCnrtlty of the Albany political
machine," she said. “After 58 years
of Democratic rule in Albany. when
the monopoly game comes up...it
