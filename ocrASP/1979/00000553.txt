The coffin is placed before the
vacant driveway. Votive candles are
placed on the shroud and lighted.
The rest of the procession, almost
entirely young Jewish men and
women, carry placards. “Bloody
Tuesday, 500 Killed”, “Remember
Gogol Street", “Hazners, in l94l
the heat was on Gogol Street - Now
it‘s on you". “Hitler's Henchman
Herc”, “Wanted - Vilis Hazners",
“Never Again". are among the
gripping slogans.

David Holland, a student at Bet
Hagga Academy, points to a
placard carried by a young woman.
“Take a look at that poster over
there." It’s a photo blowup of con-
centration camp victims. the bodies
are emaciated, stacked like cord-
wood. The caption read, “The
Final Solution". “Shocking. isn't
it? And right before us, one of the
people responsible. living there,"
he says, pointing to the house.

The little army gathers in a
semicircle around the coffin. To
the solemn faces, Zcmscr speaks of

gamble large amounts of money,"
but "did frequent OTB."

Oliver also attempted to establish
an alibi for Robinson with the
testimonies of two eyewitnesses.
Former SUNYA student Andy
Gonzalez. and student Ray Marrero
testified Monday that they “saw
Robinson on December 12 between
ll:30 und l2:l5 in his room (207
Scncctt)." 'I‘hc robbery took place
at 11:50. Murrcro said he was in the
sttitc at the time visiting one of

Robinson's suitemutcs.
.

Oliver said he was unable to
predict the jury’s decision or how
many years Robinson would be
sentenced to if convicted.

His only conuucnt about the pro-
cccdings was that “Judge Ilurris
had treated the defense sitlc unfair-
ly." He said he believed Harris was
overly rcstrictivc to the dcfcusc‘s
case.

Harris said "the court has bcnt
over backwards to give your client
every degree of fairness" and
thrczitcnctl him with contenth of
court charges.

the six million dead: of the Nazi oc-

cupation of Riga, where 12.000 of
the millions died, of the desire for
justice, and of the hope that no
such slaughter will ever happen
again. Prayers are said for the dead
and the living, as cameras whir and
click. “Merciful Father. give us
heart as we recall with tearful
tenderness the men and women who
are no longer with us in the land of
the living. Grant peace of mind to
those in our midst who bear deep
wounds in their hearts today. May
consolation come to thcnt
soon...God remember them
favorably among the righteous of
the world. May he avenge the blood
of his servants which has been
shcd.From the brook by the wayside
He will drink, and He will lift up his
head in triumpli...Amcn."

“The hope that is expressed, and
the optimism in the prayers, the
songs, and the readings, is built
on...lsrael as rt national ltotuc. and
as a source of national pride, and
on a will for survival: unless we
look out for onrsclvcs, and unlcss
we display that strength. we'll be
gone," explains Gurvis,

song. scvcrul tuovc apart and begin
scrubbing thc broken pavement
with toothbrushes.

As “Dona, Donn," the song of
the calf being led to sluttglucr, is
sting, a State Police cur rolls up
quietly. A few of the group lum-
drifted onto tlic driveway. Rabbi
Silton gets into the cur. llcuds huh
and hands movc behind the wind-
shield. The rabbi gets out. and
speaks to a young woman. She
Iy ushers the driftcrs back onto the
road. The police, satisfied, lcuvc.
“Am Yisrucl Chat", Is't‘ucl Will
Live Forever, is sung.

Rabbi Silton. now slunding at the
back of the gathering, tells the
reporter. "I would hope that there's

 

an important lesson for humanity
here: that people who commit
genocide are not allowed to walk
away free, and not be brought to
justice." He clears his throat. His
eyes glisten as he gazes at the blank
housefront. “Mankind doesn’t
understand what kind of lesson
we're teaching in history. This Is the
principal point."

"Hatikvah" is played again. and
the students join in the song. The
coffin is picked up, and borne slow-
ly back down the road. The North

Country air is growing colder now.'
The students are boarding the big‘
'green has for the return trip. The'y,

Students Protest Accused Nazi

While the vigil was to be a
peaceful and orderly demonstra-
tion, the group expected to en-
counter mucli police surveillance
and the presence of presumed
"co-Nazi organizations such as the
Christian Defense League.

However, a sole patrolman arriv-
ed at the scene to request that the
group lcuvc Ila/.ucrs' tlrIVCWily. He
drove away Inorncnls Iatcr.

(iurvis explained that vigil par-
ticipants were instructed to conduct
a peaceful rully, refraining from

anners admitted to lying on his
visa in l956 and the hearings have
been going on for years. We're re-
questing a fair hearing and a quick
one."

While Student Association (SA)
received complaints regarding SA's
funding of the vigil, SA President
Lisa Ncwmark said JSC-llillel‘s
project fell within the rules of the
finance policy. Funds were allotted
for advertising only and transporta-
tion was paid for by vigil pur-
liclpunts.

According to SA Vice President
Tito Martinez, who attended the
vigil. the event "was not an SA
cvcut."

I"I‘hc project was within thc
guidelines of .IS(' and SA could not
stop or rcstruiu the group. We
didn't fund it, encouragc it, or
discourage it," said Muriine‘l.

He added that he was glad he at-
teudcd the vigil. “it's not a ques-
tion of infringing on his rights but
to fix a wrong done by the in-
dividual. Enough evidence has been
presented against him.“
