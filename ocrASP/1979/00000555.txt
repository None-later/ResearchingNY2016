ecutive to see that the dice are not
loaded."

Another Democratic incumbent,
Guy D. Paquin. held on to his posi-
tion. denying the Albany County
clerk post to Republican Maris
Hart. The challenger claims to have
sought the post as a result of ques-
tions as to the effectiveness of Pa-
quin’s performance in office.

Hart expressed the desire “to
make the office a people's office,"
citing a close correlation between
the clerk’s office and such service
agencies as the County Office of
Consumer Protection. Site typified
the duties of the clerk as primarily
recordkccping. wliilc pointing out
the potential benefits of her ex-
perience in business.

“People don‘t see it as a par-
ticularly itnportaiit office.” said tltc
former Colonic coaneilwotnan.
“Matty think that the job of county
clerk should be art appointed one."

Races for the positions of Albany
County comptroller and Albany Ci-

ty Council president also showed up
as Republicah losses. In the former
election, Republican candidate
Deborah A. Botch was defeated by
Democrat Edward T. Stack. In tlic
latter. Democratic incumbent
James Giblin came out 3,000 votes
ahead of Republican cltarlcs
Toulty. The filial tally in that elec-
torial fight was Giblin 13.000 and

“The demonstration called atten-
tion to the slow process of the U.S.
Courts. 149 of these criminals have
been employed by U.S. Intelligence
agencies since the end of World
War II. Attd not one of the over 200
convicted criminals has actually
been deported." said Silton.

“I don't want my grandchildren
to say to me, 'thn you found out
about the war criminals. why didn‘t
you do something about it?’ I have.
These students have." he added.

An ABC news and camera crew
interviewed ralliers and filmed the
event. According to ABC film pro-
dttccr Richard (indoll. the footage
will be used iii ll documentary on
Nazi war critninals iii America. It
will be aired in December or
January.

Adut'sement w
Success

continued from page three ' '

Undergraduate Education (CUE). '

the Humanities Advisement Center
provides individuals with more
practical experience.

According to student Lori Mcll-
waine. the Center was as imper-

sonal as CUE and was unable to'

answer her questions. A language
major, Mcllwaine hoped the Center
would aid her in choosing electives.
However. she was advised by a
theatre department staff member,

'WllO suggested she take theatre

courses.

“I thought maybe the people ad-
vising rue would be more interested
in my concerns rather than their
own departments. I’m a Spanish
major and I go to my department
for specific information, but I just
wanted general information from
the Center. They couldn’t answer
my questions." said Mcllwainc.

Grimes said that a number of
students have expressed satisfaction
with the Center. claiming that it of-
fcrs information they have never
received before. “We have been
quite heavy with sttidcnt requests.
Students are especially concerned
now with their futures and there are
strong misconceptions about pro-
grams."

In addition to advisement. the
Center is making recommendations
for revising registration ptoccdures.
such as increasing availability of tip-
datcd closed course lists and enabl-
ing students to receive slal'f
signatures for drop-add cards.
