grounds enough for deportation.

On Sunday. 50 students from SUNYA'S
Jewish Students Coalition held a peaceful
ccrentony outside Hazncrs' home. They said
a few prayers. sung a few songs, and shcd a

decrees resulting in the mass murders of ,
750,000 Jews. Gypsies. Serbs. and Croats..
He presently resides in sunny California: his
brother is one of the wealthiest contractors
on the West Coast and has much political
clout there.

Some more amusing justice: in l977. a
Special Litigations Unit was set up. was
presumably provided a million dollar budget.
and was mandated by Congress to prosecute
Nazi war criminals and collaborators. This
funding never materialized, there was a total
lack of leadership from the Carter Ad» ,
ministration, and the unit was quickly labeled .
as “a sort of systcnt of non-management" by ,
the then U.S. Attorney Griffen Bell. Of the l
ﬁve attorneys in the organization. one had no 
trial experience. another only Legal Aid l
background. and among the other tltrcc. less 
than five years experience as trial lawyers. '

in the Hazncrs hearing, the defendant's at-
torncy openly accused the witnesses. who had
lost most of their fantin members. of being
part 'of some KGB communist plot. He
disregarded tltc fact that these victims had l'l-
ed their native Latvia to escape from post-
war communist persecution.

The judge in the Hazncrs hearing. respon-
ding to the inability of the old and fccblc
witnesses to respond well. remarked in the
Albany courtroom. “You‘know these peo-
plc. the Jews. tltcy always answer a question
with a question."

And to top tltc list. Hazncrs ltitnsclf was

side the courtroom. He was ' ‘ ' u with his
son over the proceedings. it took “every last
bit of effort" for the witness not to hit him.

For now. both briefs arc ir and the judge
has all tltc tituc he wants to come to a deci-
sion. if he finds Hazncrs guilty, the man's ttt-
torncy cart ask for an appeal. which could
take another year or more.

Tltc court movcs slow, and as the situation .
ages. so do the witnesses and thc dcfcndant.
Tltcy are all in their lzuc sixties and seventies.

At the January. 1977. ltcaring in Albany.
there weren‘t more than a handful of city
residents present. With such a lack ofintcrcst
and concern in Albany. it‘s Ito wonder that
the judge-wilt'nclay his decision as long as
possible.

Thus. tltc purpose of the vigil.

JSC had ti fundamental right to become in-
volved in the issue as Americans. for tltc
upholding. defense and scrutiny ovcr trttc
justice; as students. who iii the face of apathy l

 

and idealism. and as Jews. who cannot 7
and should not —— rest peacefully until jtntivu
has been served their ancestors.

The above listed cases. and more. can go
well beyond the scope of this ttrticlc. the put-
posc of tltcir citations is to present tlu-
SUNYA vigil. not as an act that will pit-unlitc
an individual. bttt as an act of contact-om
protest in the face of evil. thn tlu- gotctu-
tncnts and courts are not httndling an issue
properly, it is the duty of citizens to focus in.,

if the full story of the U.S. cover-up of
Nazi criminals should finally conic to light,
Watergate would appear as n tricklc in your
parison with this destructive flood of ill-
justice.

The sins of hesitation. OVCI‘Clllilltlll‘tllt‘s‘t.
appeasement, complacency. and silt-nu- in
the face of evil are as gravc now as thcy \tctc

Wicsenthal. “Those who forgct tln-

arid opposition will maintain their ctivc zeal criminals for ct tlte victims."

clarify some misconceptions that were
presented in their letter.

To begin with. these f0ur "gentlemen"
stated that “JSC-Hillel has raped lhc
constitution by usurping the basic right of
trial by jury“: when. in fact. llazncrs was
never on trial but rather had a hearing to
determine whether or not he faced proper
grounds for deportation. The major
infraction brought up during this hearing was
that Hazners lied on his visa when he entered
the country. Hazncrs conccdcd to lying on his
visa and whether he is to face deportation or
not is up to the discretion of the presiding
judgc. ‘

The primary purpose of the rally (which
was not fundcd by S.A.) was firstly to hasten
the judge's decision on deportation. Secondly.
to make the public uwurc of the serious
implications of tltc hearing. And finally. to
bring the public's ttttcntion to tltc fact llitll
tltcrc arc prcscntly (according to Simon
Wicscnthul) ill Icttst 250 Nil/l war criminals
enjoying American citircnship.

Wc belicvc thcrc is a dirch tic-in between
the situation of Nco-Nalis marching through
the streets ofAntcrictt and Nit/l war criminals
living in pctlct.‘ and comfort in America. The
Nco-Ntt/is do not bclicvc that thcy llil\‘t.‘
anything to fear bccausc they scc that those
who have already nutrdcrcd l2 million people
can sit in this country with little if any
ttllL'lllltllt front the community at lttrgc.

Wc urc not stating that lln/ncrs is guilty of
any war crintcs. Rather we arc hoping for his
cvcntuttl dcportntion to West (icrmuny or
Lutviu where he will he tried for these ullcgcd
atrocities. (For example the forcing of Jews
into tltc (iogol Strcct synagogue lll Riga
l.iil\'lii and then burning it to the ground.)
l’urthcrmotc. it sccms a rally of this nnturc

Truth in Testing is a touchy issue, only because those who support. administer.
and make a living off of standardized testing realize how fragile yet painfully effec-
tive their hold over students is.
Students are fearful of standardized testing. from high school’s SATs to LSATs.
GREs. GMATs, and Med Boards, as well as other forms of standardized testing.
This fear arises from the truthful horror that living. breathing human beings are
rubber stamped a grade that will stick to them like Krazy Glue whether it shines in
the 98th percentile. or looms in the basement of below average. ‘ I -
Standardized tests claim to measure aptitude. but they do not do that. What they
do measure is the degree a student can adjust his or her mind to the level of a three
hour exam, the degree a student can conform to an established mode of testing. the
degree a student can learn a planned reaction, which, by the way. is arbitrary. sub-
jective. and misleading as all hell. By keeping the contents of the test secret, they are
openly admitting that this measure of “aptitude” would not stand up against the
I test of reality by members of the student community.
The test makers claim that secrecy arises because of a limited amount of questions
available, but if true aptitude is really being tested. then how can they possibly run
out. or rely on the same ones or types already used, year after year?
Four years at an institute of higher learning should not boil down to a few hours
on some sultry Saturday morning. showing some computer how you can conform to
the norm established by profit-making businessmctt in Princeton. NJ. The system is
ludicrous.
As untrue a representation as grades have become, they are still better than the
tests being given to supplement student knowledge on part ofa prospective school.
Another irony is the courses offered by various pcoplc to raise standardized test
grades. Groups like Stanley Kaplan’s Law Review Cottrsc create an unfair advan-
tage. not by increasing aptitude, bill by increasing abilities to anticipate and prepare
for the exam itself.
The entire system is loaded with fallacies. falsehoods. and unfair advantages. it
would take a brave school to bc the first to discard this ridiculousness. but students
cannot do a damn thing. Our futures are being playcd with under the guise of
“aptitude”. when in reality. tltc nervousness and pressures associated with these cir-
cus_cs ofﬁcxamination are clear proof of the unrcalitics ltcrc. Students are forced not
to be thcmsclvcs. though it is tltcmsclvcs'who will walk out into tltc world and live a
life.
Onc's aptitude should shinc l'rccly attd openly. if it can't be tested. then give up
trying for God‘s sake. because tltcrc is no reason we have to lose hours of sleep.
calmness. and demeanor to wake tip and be slaves to a fucked up system.
