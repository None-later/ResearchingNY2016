knew it would be tough to score ‘
that many points."

Starting from their own 35 yard
line. Albany failed to get a first
down. but an Ithaca offsides on
Dave Hardy’s punt gave the ball
back to the Danes. Walsh then ran
for IS yards to the Bomber 38 with
just 39 seconds left in the ﬁrsthalf.
The forward movement continued
as halfback Jack Burger took a

pitch and carried for 18 yards to the ‘

Ithaca 20. But Burger lost the ball
as he was hit. Albany's seventh
fumble of the half. and the
Bombers ran' out the clock and off
the field with the contest anything
but a contest. ‘

Ford explained the blowout as a

nu'mber of contributing factors:
“The injuries from the previous
week didn’t help. and a lot of kids
weren’t able to practice during the
week. We had seven fumbles in the
first half. and you can’t do that
against a good opponent. Their of-
fense was extremely well prepared
—— they had an excellent gameplan
and they did an excellent job of ex-
ecuting."
RDown 26-0, the Danes tried to
shake off the first halfas ifit was a
bad dream. “i felt if we got a break
immediately in the second half it
might have picked us up.” Ford
said. Instead of a break. the Danes
broke. It took Ithaca ninc plavs to
go 66 yards on their opening drive
of the third quarter. and with the
scoreboard now reading 32-0. Ford
felt “it was only a matter of what
the ﬁnal score would be."

After Ferrigno's 48 yard scoring
run gave the Bombers a 39 point
cushion, the Danes managed their

lone touchdown. A fumble by

option team. which is similar to the
Albany wishbone, and we knew
some of the problems that existed.
We used more different things
defensively to stop the wishbone.”
The 40 point losing margin was
the worst setback in Albany State
football history, and it came after
the Danes reached new highs in
both the Lambert Bowl and na-
tional rankings, both of which will
undoubtedly plummet when this
week’s polls are released. It also
came after Albany's dramatic 28-25
victory over powerful Norwich, a
win that took a great deal out of the
Danes, both physically and emo-
tionally. Defensive end Matt Bran-
cato. kicker Dario Arango. and
halfback Sam Halstion all were
sidelincd with injuries against
Ithaca, while Walsh. corncrback
.Ioc Rajczak. and defensive back

Daryl Haynor played at less. than
peak condition.

“We put out 150 percent for
Norwich," said Walsh. “And then
with all the injuries, we didn’t, have
a good week of practice at all. We
were hoping we could pick it up
from the Norwiclt game, but we
couldn't." ~ -

“i did a poor job of judging the
team." said Ford. “l felt we could
approach this game with a low tem-
po. and we would be emotionally
ready for Ithaca. But l misjudged
that."

“We certainly enhanced our
playoff chances." said Butterfield.
“We beat the seventh-ranked team
in the nation, and we beat them
handily."

Handin enough to shove that.
seventh—ranked Dane team right out
'of' the playoffs. '

Field Goals By mu. Give
Houston 9-6 Victory

MIAMI (AP) ABC treated a huge
television audience to the classic
thriller “Jaws” Sunday night. but
the toothless Miami Dolphins’ of-
fense made Monday night’s encore
considerably less litillaring.

Houston. behind a 34-year-old
Austrian who may right now be the
best placekickcr in the National
Football League. nipped the
Dolphins 9-6. Torti Frilsch kicked
field goals of 46, 48. and 39 yards
and provided the 7-3 Oilcrs' winn-
ing margin for the fourth time this
season.

“Toni is the best kicker I've ever
seen. Toni is like having an ace in
the hole. He makes my job easier.“
said Oilcr quarterback Dun

Pastorini. held to 25 yards passing.

Dolphin rookie Uwe von
Schumann countered with boots of
32 and 51 yards. but he did not get
his chance for a third. Halfback
Gary Davis. playing in place of the
injurcd Delvin Williams. lost two
costly fumbles. and embattled
quarterback Bob Griesc was in-
tcrccptcd twice in lhc fourth
quarter.

The second interception came
with two minutes left in the game
and Miami at lhc Houston 20 — a
chip shot for thc blossoming von
Schumann.

with the interception to preserve the
victory.

“I was getting tired. it was past

something to wake everyone up."
Bingham said.

“Bob was supposed to read me.

Bingham. who also intercepted
Gricsc in the fourth quarter of

thing we couldn't let happen, and

“We had the opportunitics. lix-
ccpt for the two field goals. we

anything." Shqu said.

The Dolphins. 6-4. dropped a
game behind New England in the
AFC East. They have ycl to beat a
team with a whining record.

syracuse Blames Loss on I
Incompetent Officiating _

SYRACUSE. N.Y. (AP) Coach
Frank Maloney says incompetent
officiating provided Pittsburgh
with its margin of victory over his
Syracuse University football team
last Saturday.

“You can‘t make these
statements when you lose and ex-
pect to have much credibility."
Maloney said before making his
critical statements of the referccing
at the Pitt game. which Syracuse
lost by one touchdown.

"The most critical calls came on
the first punt. You're talking about
a swing of anywhere from seven to
It) or M points on that one; at the
very least scvcn points," Maloney
said Monday.

On that first punt by Syracuse
pnnlcr John Anderson. Terry
White hobbled the hall and the
referee placed the football inches
outside the cndzonc. Films of the
play showed the Pitt player had
been tackled in the end ZOIIL’ which
should have been a two-point safety

for Syracuse. Syracuse coaches
said.

But the play was nullified anyway
when another rcfcrcc penalized

Syracuse for an illegal punt fortitu-

tion and on the second punt White
ran the ball back 85 yards for a
touchdown.

"It was a premeditated call.
We‘ve been lining up that way in all
our games. but this time we got call-
ed. This sectionalism'in officiating
will ruin the game. We have to
establish one national body of of-
ficials." Maloney said.

The Syracuse coach said White's
touehdown should also have been
nullified by penalties.

“Our films show there were three
violations on White’s return. There
were two clips and one block below
the waist. and one of these was
contmitlcd within five feet of the
referee." Maloney said.

Syracuse fell to 5-3 with the loss.
The last several games with Pitt.
Syracuse has given the favored Part-
thers a tough game and Syracuse
coaches have been critical of the of-
ficiating at Pittsburgh.

Maloney said that he telephoned
the Major Independents Associa-
tion to inform them he does not
worn any of the referees from
Saturday's Pitt game refereeing any
future games involving his
Orungcrncn.
