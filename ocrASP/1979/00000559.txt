COLUMBUS. Ohio (AP) An Ohio
State football victory over lowa
Saturday, coupled with a Purdue
triumph over Michigan, will send
the third-ranked Buckeyes lo the
Rose Bowl for the first time since

If that happens. Ohio Stale could
lose at Michigan the following week
and still represent the Big Ten Cott-

classic on New Year‘s Day.

The reason is a set of guidelines

If Ohio State and Purdtlc win

 Norton, Feels F0; ‘ ‘ .
Children That Are Abused " — A.

(AP) The man who broke Muham-
mad Ali's jaw and in the Opinion of
many ringsiders scored three vic-
tories over the greatest fighter of
the age can’t stand to see a small
child cry.

"I've seen them with their noses
broken, their eyes blacked and their
little bodies bruised all over," says
Ken Norton. "I've seen thcinafter
they've been tossed ottt of three-
story windows and dumped into a
scalding bathtub.

» "Abused and molested kids are
the greatest tragedy of our time."

Tltc 6-fool-3. 220-pound Norton,
one of the Inost superb physical
specimens the gatnc has produced,
has hung up his gloves and turned
his aucnliou to gentler and there
charitable pursuits.

The handsome, 'chiselcd features
which have bcctt subjected to the
most destructive fists of the genera-
tion are being preserved for ex-
posure to the Hollywood and televi-
sion screens. The cncrglcs long
dcvotcd to ring violence are being
divcrlctl to Iltc discouragcmcnt of
parental abuse of children.

“I never want to fight agaiv "
Norton said on 11 stop-over in New
York en route to a broadcasting
:tssignnicnt in Scotland. "I want to
bttild a ncw lil'c for myself in acting
and lrottdcasling. I want to spend
my spare time helping kills beaten
up by parents and lttlng up on
drugs.”

Norton learned to fight in the
Marines wlterc he was All-Marines

champion in 1965, 1966 and 1967.
He had his first pro fight itt 1968,
but success ctttttc slowly.

But the world became aware of
him on March 3|, 1973, when he

fractured Ali's jaw and scored a
12-round upset in a non-title bout.
He fought Ali again in September
of the same year and on September
28, 1976 — brutal brawls he lost but
which many experts scored for Nor—
ton.

It was the latter ﬁght in Yankee
Stadium, when he came so close to
the undisputed world heavyweight
crown, that drained Norton of all
of his spirit.

“I never had a good light after
that." he said; “I felt a knot in the
pit of my stomach. I felt stripped of
everything I ever owned. From that
point on, I went steadily downhill.”

Bttt sited no tears for Ken Nor-
ton. As a fighter, he made around
$10 million, exceeded only by Ali
and Frazier. and handled it discreet-
ly. Today he is a multi-millionairc,
owner of apartment houses and in-
dustrial complexes in the Los
Angclcs area. ‘

“When I was collecting good
purses." he said, “I followed a ﬁx-
ed formula — bank half of it and
blow the other half." His heart,
though, is with kids. He is deeply
involved in Bronco Junction, ti
charity for Asthmatic, Battered,
and Abused Children.

“It tcurs your heart out to look at
some of them," he said. “I don't
understand how parents can be so
crttcl. It's all rigltt to hung a man in
the ring —- thcy’re two equals — bttl
hit a kid? It's sickening."
