at Hamilton. N.Y. Tlte loss moves
the Danes' record to 2-5.

According to Albany J.V. ltead

“not as bad as it seems." He cited
that. after giving up 23 first half
points, Colgate was allowed only a
touchdown and a safety in the se-
cond half. The defense stopped Chl-
gate twice inside the ten.

"As a unit, they played very
well," said . Mayer of iris Dartc

Women Boaters Lose

The Albany State women’s soccer
team lost their last game of the
season to Springﬁeld 4-0 Saturday
in what Albany women‘s soccer
coach Amy Kidder “called their
“toughest game of the year." V

Terrible field conditions due to
two solid hours of rain inhibited the
women’s game somewhat. and they
were not able to score a single goal.
Yet Kidder feels that tile women
played their best game ever.

"We played a great game, very
consistent. and very aggressive,"
said Kidder. “We seem to play up
to the'caliber of the teams we play.
Springﬁeld was our toughest game.

wet out. did well. and played the
way they're capable of playing."

l-‘or tlte second consecutive l’ri-
day. the Albany offense was nonex-
istcnt. As a team whose tnaitt pur-
pose is to prepare athletes for the
varsity. the jayvccs do not get much
time to work together as a ttttit.
Because of tltis, execution. especial»
ly on offense, cart be difficult.
Another factor that Mayer pointeti
out was tltc physical superiority and
dominance of the opponent. "They
were a lot bigger than we were. We
didn't move the ball too well offen-

tlte best team we played all year.
Although we weren‘t able to score,
we put up a good fight.”

Kidder is extremely pleased with
the women‘s performance this year.
The women’s soccer team ended the
season with a record of 6-3-2, quite
a difference from last year's winlcss

' season. The team also scored 26
goals to their opponent‘s 17 goals.
With the exception of the Spr-
ingfield game. the Albany women
never lost by more than one point.

“We have a lot to be proud of."
said Kidder. “We had a good, solid

The coach wasn't totally

disgusted with the squad's perfor-

the kind of mistakes that make you
look inept. They (the players) re»
ntain positive. They keep coming."

concluded that it was the kicking of
Tom Lincoln.

The season concludes next
weekend. as the jayvecs travel to

Now that the team has establish-
ed itself as a winning soccer clttb.
Kidder is optimistic about next

be returning next year. The team’s
goal credits are impressive and
widespread. Sue Stern led the team

“We used this year for ex-

Seventh Place Finish For

Dane Harriers In States’

1 by Ken Cantor

On Saturday afternoon in
Binghamton, the Albany men‘s var-
sity cross country team toppled to a
weak seventh place finish in the
New York State Collegiate Associa-
tion track and field meet. in the
meet, Frcdonia finished first with a
total of 52 points. Marist College
finished next with l04 points,
followed by Binghamton with ll7
points, Rochester with 166, St.
Lawrence and Union Colleges with
l72 points and Albany in seventh
with 180.

The Albany team was led by cap-
tain and number-one runner Bill
Mathis. He ﬁnished 17th out of the
field of l3l. However. in the words
of cross country coach Bob
Munsey. “Mathis had a poor meet.
He is capable of better perfor—
manees." Scott James. a
sopltontorc. had a fine day as he ran
the difficult Binghamton course
with great determination. Jack
Russo finished in 35th place. while
pulling a muscle during the ntcet.
Mike Sayers and lsmacl Cruz finish-
cd in 46111 and 60th place. respec-
tively.

On tltc whole very
uttcager pcrforntance by tltc Albany
harriers. They ltavc had qttite a
strenuous schedule with four con—
secutive ntects »in the last fottr
weeks. "The team was not mentally
psyched," Munsey said. “We ltave
had a lot of tough meets recently.

it Was a

The schedule has been relentless.
We have also had quite an injury
problem for this late in the season.
When you combine the schedule
and the injuries you can see that it
was really hard for us to be mentally
prepared for this meet. Besides, we
really have to get mentally prepared
for our big meet next week." The
event Munsey was talking about
was the qualifying meet being held
this upcontittg Saturday in
Binghamton for the Division til ti-
tie.

in the N.Y. Collegiate meet last
year a stronger Dane varsity team
finished second. According to
Munsey, last year's team had a
greater amount of depth in cont-
parison to this year's team. About
the upcoming meet. Munsey com-
mented: "i think it will be possible
for us to be one of tltc final four
qualifiers after this weekend’s meet.
it is essential that we get a max—
imum effort from all of our people.
We don't have that many guys that
can come in and pick up the slack
like we had last year. Hopefully.
track conditions will he better than
they were last wcckend." -

This Albany team is hopeful that
it will place in the top four itt this
weekend’s qualificﬂs meet. The
Division III qualifiers will then go
on to tile national meet two weeks
later in illinois. This will be a tough
achievement for the Dane harricrs

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

NOVEMBER 7, 1979

 

 

 

    
 

by Amy Kantor

American women athletes have
run the distance in recent years, but
the acceptance and mobility they
enjoy compared to their male
counterparts still leaves much to be
desired in many sports. A lack of
social recognition, advancement.
and prohibition of their participa-
tion is illustrated in the area of
women’s long distance cross coun-
try running — the marathon — at
the world's most prestigious level of
competition. the international
Olympic Games. held every four
years.

Albany State physical education
associate professor and track expert
Barbara Palm is aware of tltis. and
is doing something about it. Cur-
rently on leave front the university,
and relinquishing her duties as
coach of the women’s varsity cross
country team to Casey Reynolds
this year, Palm has engaged herself ,
and in a larger sense, her career, to
an international women's Olympic
campaign. if approved. her project
will add women's 5.000. 10,000
meter and marathon racing to the
1984 Olympics. which the United
States will host in Los Angeles.
California.

Site is at the helm of the cott-
quest. serving her fourth year as
chairperson of the 75 member
American National Committee of
the Women’s Long Distance Runn-
ing Federation. the worldwide
sports governing body for all runn-
ing events. Her athletic ad-
ministrative talents are being used
fully for the insertion of these races
into the ‘80 Games in the Union of
Soviet Socialists Republic. “We
want the events for women that
men ltave enjoyed for as long as i
can remember," said Palm.

Her campaign began approx-
imately five years ago when ltcr
organization broke from the
Women's Track and Field Commis-
sion because, according to Paint.
“they were not doing enough to
promote women's long distance
running or taking their requests to
the international Amateur Athletic
Federation (iAAF)."

The marathon events for women
have not gained prominence in
many of the 152 member nations of
the iAAF. “A lot of small countries
don't have long distance runners or
they don't believe women should
run long distance." Palm explain-
ed, pointing out the liberal social
system of the United States. Coun~
tries in Asia. Africa, or other na-
tions under Communist rule can be

quite negative about what kind of
athletics in which women can par-
ticipate, and all iAAF countries are
entitled to vote expressing their
new. “You find international
discrimination based on the social
patterning of other countries,"
Palm assessed. However, she noted,
"women run in the 15,000 meter
race in the Pan American Games."

The international meaning of
athletics is running. As for 1980 in
Moscow, women's Olympic track
events will include the three and
four thousand nteter run, and a
women's hurdle is scheduled as part
of the chatnpionship events and
world cup competition. The home
country gets the privilege to drop or
add events. Lookirtg back as far as
l972 in Munich. the women's
marathon found low enthusiasm.
That year. the Germans added
another regulation race. Four years
later, the marathon was thrown out
in Montreal. and the Russians will
add the i0 kilometer walk this sunt-
mer.

But 1980 takes an additional
meaning for the Palm coalition.
The semi-annual ntecting of the

Women's Commission of the iAAF ‘

will take place at the games. The
group will vote as to which events
will be placed in the l980 competi-
tion. Women's long distance runn-

 

tions. in a key move that authen-
ticated the confrontation for next
summer, delegates informed the
higher ofﬁcials that they would
form their own commission if the
marathon matter was not dealt with
reasonably. The ultimatum. ac-
complished after four years of try-
ing to make headway, forced the
WLDRF to recommend the pro-
posal to the iAAF Technical Com-
mittee. Discussion of the marathon
was soon scheduled for it meeting
before the iAAF full congress on
March 9. 1980. Meanwhile. lobby-
ing and "playing politics with
sports" are effective present
measures of action for the diehards.

The primary function of the
WLDRF is to promote and develop
long distance runtting ilt this
hemisphere. But the federation
wanted statistics front Palm. She
composed attd sent a questionnaire
dealing with the marathon situation
to several countries. However. she
was met with a minimal response.

of the Amateur Athletic Union. all
to promote women's long distance
running.

Where is Barbara Palm in this
crusade? At the lead, for one, and
also in the history. She has been
with the AAU for 15 years.
“Women's long distance running
has always been a favorite of
mine," she claims. “l began runn-

 

 

ing when l was a student late for
school." But she still secs funding
in the United States being put
towards the development of
women's track and field. while the
marathon finds little representa-
tion.

Deterntincd. site is on leave
without pay from Albany. and
though site came to the university in
l964. site doesn’t "know where 1'"
be next year." Paint spoke about
holding out financially. which will
decide tlte length of her absence.

“This sport's been good to me
and l've got to give something back
to it," Paint said. She recalled the
early days of Albany women's
sports. and her contributions which
became reality in i969 when the
women‘s track program ofﬁcially
began here. Highly instrumental,
Palm also ushered in cross country
and indoor track at Albany more
than four years ago. She told of
Ann Rugh, ‘74. who qualiﬁed for
the Boston Marathon and was in
Germany for the Avon happening
last month. Palm singled out the
Tennessee all-Black college track
team that produced 35 Olympians.
Yes. ‘it can be done.‘

Palm has traveled world-wide
since her full-time efforts began.
Since Germany, she's been to Kan-
sas City. New York City twice and
will return to LA. this weekend for
a second time. She will stop at
Boston before ﬂying far east to
Japan on November 13. The
Japanese Federation will foot the
bill. for she is listed as the United
States team leader.

“When i think of the Olympics, i
tltink of track and field and the run-
ning events." Palm states. Site
views women's track as being on the
upswing. “But New York," she
feels. “has been one of the slower

American states. Southwestern
states have been way ahead for
years."

Presently, Palm is reaching for
the stars trying to fulﬁll her Olym-
pic dream. Asked “What's next?"

 

site answered, “l'd like to get
through this one first." -
