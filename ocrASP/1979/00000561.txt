Ithaca Sends Danes Reeling With 46-6, Massacre

by Paul Schwartz

lTHACA — A Dane season that

had so much now has so little.
With» chilling effectiveness, the

Ithaca Bombers took an undefeated

Albany State football squad and -

shattered them. So complete was
Ithaca's 46-6 rout Saturday that the
Bombers soared solidly into the
playoff picture. while the Danes
were left wondering how damaging
a 40 point loss can be.

The debacle put Albany‘s record
at 6-1 and all but crushed the Danes
once-strong hopes for post-season
play. Ithaca now stands at

7-2,undefeated in Division III. and .

almost a certain choice for one of
the eastern playoff bids. The'na-
tional committee usually selects two
teams from each region. and Mom-
clair State (7-l-l). New Haven
(6-0-1) and Albany are all in conten-
tion for a possible selection this
Sunday. But the timing and score of
the Danes’ lone loss will weigh
heavily against them.

"Realistically. I would say we‘re
eliminated." said Albany head
football coach Bob Ford. “All we
have is a faint glimmer of hope."

The Bombers turned what was
expected to be a close game into a
stunning example of total football.
and left the Danes humiliated. With
less than one minute gone in the

contest. Ithaca set their dominant
tone. Albany quarterback Mike
Fiorito. replacing the injured Terry
Walsh. fumbled on the first play.
but recovered for only ti four'yard
loss. But then Fiorito fumbled the
center exchange again on the next
play. and Bomber defensive tackle
Pete Giordano snatched up the
loose ball on the Albany nine yard
line. One play later, halfback John
Nicolo burst through a huge hole
and gave Ithaca a 7-0 lead. and the
game was on its way to being over
almost before it started.‘ ‘-

“l was definitely expecting a
close game." said Ithaca head foot-
ball coach Jim Butterfield. “I
thought we were similar in

capabilities. and I still think so. But
we got the upper hand early, and it
just steamrollcd. Albany couldn't
do anything about it."

Unable to generate their offense
the entire game. the Danes could
not convert on a fourth-and-one
situation late in the first quarter.
and gave the Bombers good field
position for their next score.
Needing one yard. Albany halfback
Levi Louis was stopped for a loss by
an aggressive Ithaca defense. and
the Bomhcrs took over on their own
49 yard line. From there. quarter-
back Doug Bencsko started a pass-

ing barrage that would see Bomber
signalcallers throw the ball 39 times
— a new single game Ithaca record
—— and complete I8 for 259 yards.
mostly to wide open receivers. A 20
yard Bencsko pass to Split end Jim
Duncan and a 15 yard run by

fullback ' Bob Ferrigno brought.

Ithaca to the Dane 15. and Ferrigno
finished things up with a 15 yard
jaunt to give the Bombers a 13-0
lead. still in the first quarter.
Ferrigno also got his name in the
record book by scoring five
touchdowns. breaking the old
Ithaca record by onc. and ended as

the game's leading rusher with 139
yards. The Albany defense. which
had been so successful all season.
especially against the run. broke
down against the Bombers' two-
way attack. as ltliaca rolled tip 592
total yards.

“We didn’t think they could
throw the ball that well." said
Albany defensive coordinator Jack
Siedlecki. “We'd seen what they
had done in the past. and they had
never thrown the ball to that extent.
They used two split ends and a
receiver iii the slot. which is a sound
way of attacking otir 4-4 defense. It

stretches you out and ptits you in a
different alignment. But there's no
question. they haven't shown that
capability all year long. They Itad a
great day on the right day."

“We had a lot of defensive
breakdowns." added Albany
linebacker John Vcruto. “They had
us scouted very well. When we
would stunt. they ran a play to
defeat it. and when we expected the
nut, they would go with slant-in
passes. And we didn’t play the way
we are capable of on defense at
all."

When Ithaca wasn't driving
through the Dane defense. they
were getting gift possessions leading
to short scoring bursts. A punt by
the Bombers’ Dave Whalen carried
to the Albany 30. wltcrc it bounced
and hit Daiic Ed Ragtilc. Don
Phillips pounccd on the free ball.
and Ithaca took over already in
scoring position. A 20 yard pass to
Jim Meycr sct tip Bencsko’s seven
yard touchdown run and delighted
the 4500 fans at South Hill Field. as
the Bombers coasted to a 19-0 ad-
vantage.

Bencsko thcii really began to heat
up. With Duncan. Meyer, and
ﬂanker Terry Jarvie all finding gap-
iiig holes in the Dane secondary.
Bencsko got the protection he need-
cd and time after timc he was on
target. His losses brought the
Bombers in close. from where Fer-

rigno could plow his way past ill'lll"

tackling Albany defenders and into
the eiidmite. With 7:” remaining
in the first half. a Ferrigno rush
boosted the halftime score to 26-0.

Women Swimmers Prepare With Youthful Outlook

by Mike Dunne

With seven swimmers and two
divers returning from last year's
squad, which placed 12th in a 33
team field at the New York State
meet, Albany's new women’s swim-
ming and diving coach. Sara
Bingham. has reason to be op-
timistic about the 1979-80 season.

"We’re very young but we have a
lot of potential." said Bingltam.
"I’d like to see them move up at
least five places in this year’s state
championships."

Indeed. youth seemed to be the
byword for the women as they
prepared to open their season last
night by hosting Rochester.

Virtually all of the squad's top
swimmers are freshmen and
sophomores. a perplexing situation
which Bingliam feels is rooted in the

intense physical and mental
demands made on a collegiate
swimmer.

“There is a special pain and
agony along with a great deal of
mental toughness that swimmers
must go through." noted Bingham.
“When you couple that with the
academic demands of this school it
makes it tough to keep a girl for

four years."

One who Itas persevered through
three years of competition is senior
co-captain Chuck Griswald. the
team's outstanding diver. She holds
several school records and Bingham
fully anticipates her to shatter those
marks this season.

“Chuck is a sensational diver.
She has qualiﬁed for the state meet
previously and I expect her to im-
prove. Site has looked very strong
in workouts." praised Bingham.

Along with diving, the sprint
events appear to be where Albany
will accumulate the most points.
Here they are led by sophomore
Ann Hoch (co-captain). who holds
school records in the 50 meter
freestyle and butterfly, both of
which she is expected to lower again
this season.

“I expect Aitn to be a contender
for several records." said Biiigham.
“She is an extremely strong sprinter
and a hard worker."

l'loch’s main competition will be
freshman Donna Starace who will

also swim in the freestyle and but-
tcrfly races. “It is hard to evaluate a
freshman but Donna is a good all
around swimmer. I think she is

capable of setting a 100 nieter‘but-
terlly record." said Binghami

A pair of sophomores. Carolyn
Shwidock and Karen Kicnzle. will
handle the 200 meter freestyle
duties while Judy Koltai returns
after having set the 200 meter in-
dividual medley record last season.

The distance events shape tip as
the team‘s major weakness with on-
ly one bona fide distance swimmer
available. This has forced Bitigharn
to improvise and juggle hcr swim-
iiicrs among different events.

"The girls know they’ll all have
to share the loud iii the distance
events,” iiotcd Bingliain.

Tlircc women will enter the
brcaststroking events for Albany
and Bingham evaluated them:
“They won't knock anybody over.
btit they should improve and in the
meantime they're solid."

Bingham, who previously coach-
cd for three years at Randolph-
Macon College and also spent two
seasons at Texas Women’s Univer-
sity, was predictany cautious in her
outlook on her initial season in
Albany: “We have several tough
meets with West Point and Mc(iill

' Downtown Crime Wave Causes Scare

 

OCA Heads Up Security Patrol

by Pat Branley

SUNYA's Off-Campus Associa-
tion (OCA) is implementing a
security operation to combat the
wave of break-ins and sex-related
crimes which have bccn occurring in
downtown areas near Alumni
Quad. according to OCA Coor-
dinator John Kennedy.

“The area which is most l'rc-
qticittly hit by this rash of crimes is
botindcd by Myrtle Avcmic. lilllti-
ford Sirect. Lake Street. and I’m-
iridgc Street.” he said. “Usually
the incidents occur betwccn l a.m.
and 4 a.m. and many of thc victims
are off-campus SUNYA students."

Kennedy reported that tlicsc in-
cidents have developed a pattern in
which the intruder “peeps”. enabl-
ing him to see his victim prior to the
crime. In some cases. cinder blocks
have been piled beneath the victims'

 

Indicted For Larceny In Previous Crimes

by Andrew Carrol and Karen Fien

SUNYA student John “Ritchie”
Robinson could face 25 years in jail
after being convicted of third
degree attempted robbery in Albany
County Court yesterday. nearly a
year after his arrest in the holdup of
a Home Savings Bank branch of-
fice.

In a surprise move. Judge Joseph
Harris released a second indictment
immediately following the convic-
tion. Robinson was charged with

third degree grand larceny in the Ju-
ly robberies of Manpower, Inc. and
City Service. The Western Avenue
incidents involved the theft of$750.

However. Harris did not release
the sealed indictment until after
Robinson’s trial. so that it would
not inﬂuence the jurors' decision on
the original indictment. The indict-
ment was opened in an arraignment
with Robinson. Harris. and a few
selected officials present.

After the arraignment. the indict-

    

 

ment was resealcd. The Albany
Times-Unionhas ﬁled a law suit
with the Appellate Division of the
State Supreme Court against Har-
ris. for this action.

Harris. in turn. accused the
Capitol Newspapers Group of
"waging a campaign of vililica-
tion" in an attempt to “intimidate
the courts."

Prior to the conviction. defense
attorney Lewis Oliver labelled the
prosecution “a web of inference
and suspicion.” In his summary
remarks to the judge and jury, lie '
repeatedly referred to fingerprint
evidence. handwriting analysis,
"cheap shots" and identification
photographs taken at the Central
Avenue scene. .

Olivcr‘s discussion of fingerprints
relied heavily on the testimony of
Washington, D.C. expert Paul
McAnn. The witness had maintain-
ed that “tlic fingerprints (obtained)

ty operation chief Susan Green.

According to Green. the intruder
next enters the apartment through
an unlocked window or door and
robs. sexually abuses or rttpcs the
victim. threatening harm if she
screams.

“The downtown area has bccit
plagued with brcuk-iiis and sexual
assaults since August. bill it wasn't
until lltc middle of October ‘i‘..ll a
pattern developed." said City of
Albany Police Lieutenant William
Murray. “\Vc have questionctl ti
mtiiibcr of suspects but litivc had to

release them on legal technicalities.
We might have had the right one
but since the burden of proof is on
us. we ltad to let them go."

Murray reported one suspect in
custody. charged with two similar
crimes. However. since the suspect
has been arrested. the crimes have
continued.

“This means thcrc must be
another assailant at large." said
Murray. “There also may be more
than one assailant. We cannot
determine if the remaining assaults
