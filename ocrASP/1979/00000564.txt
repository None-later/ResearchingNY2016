Woman De-lebed

The women‘s liberation move-
ment apparently has a long way to
go in Europe. if a roundup by The
Wall Street Journal is any indica-
tion.

The Journal says a recent survey
of 680 West German companies
found that only one percent of top
executives and only two percent of
middle managers were female. This
is despite the fact that women make
up forty percent of that country’s
work force.

The newspaper reports that only
one-fourth of British companies
have any written policy on equal
hiring. and that a common market
poll found that only 28 percent of
working women think they have a
chance for promotion, compared to
41 pcrccnt of the male workers who
believe they can advance. it’s not
all hopeless. liowcvcr. Women ac»
count for one-sixth of the newly—
clcctcd European Parliament, with
Fruncc's Simone Veil chosen as
president of that body.

Legal Police

Members of the police force in it
SlilIC in Southern Brazil have bccti
staging a strange work slowdown in
an effort to win pay raises: it seems

 

 

Zane 

the cops have stopped making i1-
legal arrests. _

Under normal conditions,
Brazilian police routinely arrest
anybody they want to for question-l
ing without a warrant or even
without any evidence. "

Officers involved in the
slowdown, however. are now ar~
resting people only when a warrant
has been issued or when the suspect
is seen actually committing a crime.
Arrests in the area have dropped off
90 percent since the slowdown
began.

Rolling Sevens

Many scvcn-clcvcn store owners
across the United States have ap-
parently decided to snub at recent
company-inspircd directive which
called on them to stop selling
cigttrcttE rolling papers-~papers that
are widely used for smoking pot.
All scvcn-cicvcii stores are either
owned or franchised by the
Sotitlilaiid , Corporation.
Southland's president Jcrc Thomp—
son rcccntly ordered all his
company—owncd stores to withdraw
the rolling papers flout their

 

budgets. For

n Thompson charged that--in his
words--’"the sale of cigarette papers

An Expensive Pie

The residents of a small New
Mexico town are planning a special
pie sale this w eckend to help defray
the legal expenses of a man who hit

rathclst Madalyn Murray O'Hair in

the face with a pic last month.

O'Hair filcd assault charges
against Allcii Huntcr of Albuquer-
quc after ltc pied her during a
meeting of a chapter of the
American Atheists.

Residents of Dcdona. New Mcx-
ico, say they will be holding what
they arc calling a "Pics for
Madalyn" sale this Saturday at a
local shopping center to raise
money for l-iiiiitcr's legal fees. Says
organizcr .loc Evcrctt: “We're just
trying to make sure Mrs. (')'liair
gets her just desserts."

Presidential Muzak

Now that the U.S. Prcsidcniial
Election races are beginning to heat
tip, the candidates are apparently
trying to outdo czich other by winn-
ing the support of big-panic cntcr-
,taincrs and celebrities.

According to the Canadian-based
Macleans magazine, Jerry Brown
seems to have enlisted the loudest
chorus of supporters with the
Eagles, Neil Diamond. Helen Red-
dy and (of course) Linda Ronstadt.

On the East Coast, Senator Ken-
nedy is said to have landed the en-
dorsements of such an unlikely pair
as Woody Allen and Bob Dylan.

Not to be outdone, President
Carter is reportedly counting on_thc
good old country charm of Willie
Nelson, Lorreta Lynn and Larry
Gatlin.

Entertainers have not ben quite
so active on the Republican side.
However. Ronald Reagan is said to
be planning to kick off his cam-
paign with a Boston concert.

Park Around Back

The U.S. State Department is
categorically denying Soviet allega-
tions that the Central intelligence
Agency directed the assassination
of South Korean President Park
Chung Hce. ”

The Soviet News Agency Tass
alleged that the C.i.A. played a key
role in Park's death because Park
had become-4n Tass's words--
"Too, ‘odious .a ﬁgure even for
Washington."

The Soviet News Agency alleged
that shortly before Park’s assassina-
tion last Friday. the Unitcd States
military commander in South
Korea, General John A. Wickhani.
(quote) “urgcntly flew to
Washington."

However, a state department
spokesperson insists that the C.i.A.
and all other U.S. agencies were
chlplClCly'lllllnvolvcd in last
‘wcckis killings in South Korea. The
spokesperson added that General"
Wickham's activitics were not in
any way connected to Park's dcatli.
