The Editor’s Aspect

Dr. Faustus, denies God and hell as old wives tales, and
- tries to ignore the whole spirituality question as he pur-
sues his worldly ambitions of wealth, security, and suc-
cess in concre e terms. The world is not a “veil of tears"
as it was in‘the Middle Ages when through adversity and
suffering man attained spiritual grace and salvation. Our.
motto is Carpe Deum, seize the day, live for the moment,
Tenjoy each second, because afterwards it could all go up
iin the sweet radioactive cloud burst of our intellectual ex-
1travagance. Morality, as well, as charity, begins at home
'with ourselves. We are not selfish, we are self-protecting
'because we have learned that ultimately and finally we
are alone in this universe, despite the second guessing by '
eccentric radio telescope astronomers in Guam. How can
we prove God exists when men more'intelligent than us,
great philosophers of world reknown, can’t even prove
that you and I exist? .

' there and you can do likewise for me. We are each
7 :separate entities lost in our circles. Yet, the little planet
Pluto, way out on the rim of our solar system, invisible to
the naked eye, was discovered by observing inconsisten-
cies in the orbit of neighboring Neptune. Just as Pluto af-
|fected Neptune, we affect each other. We may each be
'planets orbiting in our solitary spheres, but when another
:comes close enough to us it does throw us off our path.
.No man is a planet undisturbed in the universe. We are
prone to each others inﬂuence. Therefore we are not
alone.

though inaugurated within us, reach out across spa‘ce' to
I other like-humans and bounce back setting off a pipg
pong reverberation of feelings. We are not alone mentally
because we read a book and change our minds. And, in
the beauteous symmetry of triangular trinities, we are not
alone spiritually because, like a book will impress your
mind, like a friend will impress your heart, an unknown
factor will impress your soul. Therefore, if God is the
lunknown, and the unknown is x, solve for x.

Who is your God? Intellectual man, like the'iinfamous'

We are not physically alone because our emotions,
