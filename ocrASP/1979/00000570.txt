one would become Japanese these days if he
could help it. Funny, 1 don’t remember taking
any cocaine. Perhaps the CIA put some in my
coffee. i don‘t drink coffee; Perhaps the FBI
put some coffee intowhich the CIA had put
*some cocaine, in myghanky. Butl tend to stick
to kleenex on ihosé‘ rare occ‘urences of ill
health. There is only one true explanation. I
am the biological offspring of an allen being
from the Crab Nebula and the sister of an
alcoholic Japanese samaurl. But these
philosophical questions remind me of my
locker in tenth grade. 3307. Mary Anne loved
Buddy forever there and Mongrel 75 told Mrs.
Feinberg, the librarian, to do something which
modern science proved to be anatomically im-
possible. I later disproved the assumption
when l was a leading hypnotlst. before becom-
ing Japanese, by doing somethljig awful to fif-

rested me i told them i was with the CIA and
the sergeant winked at me, then patted me on

‘the behind and sent me off to the locker room.

That's when i started reading Erica Jong and
buying Don Ho albums —- clearly the beginn-
ings of my orlentalization. l was too young to
have realized It then.

Later, while I was lecturing on Cuisine Art

during the early Pleistocene Age to a herd of

sour-faced business majors in the lobby of the
Cherry-Netherland i thought of Yorik.

Yorlk and 1 went to Princeton together‘“

when Einstein lectured there. After classes the
three of us. Yorik, Einstein, and I, would go to
a local bar and get soused. We sang songs
about alcoholic irish sailors and their lat wives.
One day Yeats happened to be getting soused

“.1. no. '

I knew all the words to
: Kangaroo." Oddly enough, i was to meet
: Yeats one more time bet
in the Arab quarter of Mecca. Yorik and I had

the nineteenth century pseudo‘realist lew-

railroad station in Mecca l literally bumped into
Yeats while he tied his shoes. But my train was
leaving and I had no time to stop or ask for an
autographed glossy of Lillian Russel 1n the
nude, of which i knew he kept dozens of
