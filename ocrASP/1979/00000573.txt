Denver’s Futility Record

(AP) It's the kind of game Jim Zorn
and the rest of the Seattle Seahawks
would just as soon forget — but. as
Floyd Little and Scotty Glacken
have discovered. it ain't that easy.

When the ﬁnal gun cracked last
Sunday. the Seahawks had
established a National Football
League record for futility. winding
up with a total offense of minus

L . seven yards in their 24—0 loss to Los

Angeles.

That surpassed a mark of inep-
titude which had stood for more
than it dozen years. dating back to
Denver's Sl>0 loss In Oakland on
Sept. i0, I967. when Little.
Glacken and the rest of the Broncos
ﬁnished with minus ﬁve yards.

“I can still see 'em standing
there." recalled Little. “There was
big Ben Davidson; and there was
Gus Otto. and Dan Conners and
Carlton Oats and Ike Lassiter
and...oh. God. it was frightening!

Little's performance in that game
was typical of the Broncos - seven
rushes for four yards. “I remember
thinking. ‘If this is what life's gon-
na be like in the NFL. I'm in serious
trouble.“ "

The whole Denver team was in
scrIous trouble from its inception in

the American Football League in

I900 until Coach John Ralston
gutdcd it to respectability in the
mtd-l970's. And nobody knew it
better than Lou Saban. who coach-
ed the Broncos from the start ofthe

I967 season until he couldn’t take it
an more. ' ’ '
in 3:9“. quttttng after nine games
“Poor Lou." said Little. "i
remember when we got into the
locker room at halftime he told us if
we didn‘t get out there and do
something — anything -— in the rest
of the game. he was going to leave
everybody in Oakland."

,Glacken was a “seasoned” player
with the Broncos by then. starting
his second year. It turned out to be
his last. Now he‘s a partner in an in-
vestment firm and the football
coach at Georgetown University.

“Every time I turned around I
itad a black shirt in my face."
Glacken remembered. “Oakland
had such an awesome learn. They
were sort of like the Pittsburgh
Steelers are. the way they complete-
ly dominated you in every aspect of
the game. It was a total. complete
embarrassment."

But it wasn‘t
Oakland was

only because
50 good. “After

Floyd Liitté nemesis. ' 

awhile it was as though Denver
Stadium was a trolley stop that
season; five players coming In and
five going out after every game."
Glacken said. “It was a terribly
unsettled atmosphere. it didn't take
too long for panic to set in. The
players started second-guessing the
coaches. the coaches started losing
faith in their players."

When Seattle Coach Jack Patera
was asked if he'd learned anything
from the Seahawks' performance
against Los Angeles. he shrugged
and replied: “I can't think of a
thing." But Glacken recalled he'd
learned something at the hands of
the Raiders l2 years ago.
"Humility." he said.
