await the Carillon with its football

but there is no football schedule.
Further research is thus necessary. I
try a college football magazine. It
seems to list every college schedule.

starts as the Danes win the opener

Now I have to keep track of the
team. i start posting the score on
my bulletin board at work. As the
Danes continue to pile up victories.
I perform my weekly ritual of plac-
ing the results on the board for the
perusal of my colleagues. I create
some interest among the office
mates. They ask about the scores
and reached the point where the

when I was away from the office on

' a Monday. After all. ifNotre Dame

can have a subway alumni. why
can't Albany.

As for me, l finally return to'

University Field to see the Danes
play Norwich in late October. I
think back to the game I saw five
years ago. in which Albany beat
RPI to complete an undefeated
season. The sky was its usual
depressing grey. and the weather
was typically cold. This day in Oc-
tober is basically a new experience
for me. The PA. blarred music
from Rocky. and Albany even has a
pep band to play the national an—
them. The playcrs from the 1974
undefeated team have been
graduated for some time. However.

, the guys on the field wore purple,

and that was sufficient to keep me
cheering all afternoon.

The fans remained enthusiastic
throughout. The game, as always.
was exciting. The defense was
strong all the way. but the offense
was spotty. The fans. including
myself. were not disappointed as
Albany came from behind to pull
otit the victory.

But I was not surprised. Aftcr till.
I haven't seen the Danes lose at
home since my freshman year
(1971). The subway alumni was also
pleased with the result.

Sage Tops Women Swimmers

by lAmy.Klnlol'

In a meet marked by some con-
troversy. Albany State‘s women’s
swimming and diving team dropped
their season opener to Russell Sage
College. 75-65. Tuesday evening at
University Pool.

The score was determined in the
ﬁnal event, the 200 yard free style
race. consisting of three swimmers
from each team and won by Sage
on a disqualiﬁcation call against
Albany.

With Albany trailing 68-65 going
into the last race.‘ Albany coach
Sarah Bingham sent swimmers Ann
Hoch. Donna Starace and Caroline
Shwidock In the water. in an at-
tempt to wrap up the meet’lvith a
come-from-behind victory.

Albany Outswam Sage. winning
the game on the boards and in the
water. For an instant. the lights
ﬂashed a 72-68 Albany victory. but
the numbers quickly changed in
favor of Sage. and the confusion
began. An ofﬁcial singled out an
Albany swimmer who entered the
pool before a Sage swimmer
finished her segment of the race.
Wliilc Sage cheered the new call.
Albany. by Bingham. flocked
to the judges in protest. Albany was
hit with an additional infraction.
that following the form of an ex-
hibition evont in an official relay.
and the rule books were immediate-
ly brought out. Binghuni placed the

meet.under protest but. until a ﬁnal
decisron is reached. the Danes

record will hold at 0-l.

The Sage win was their third con-
secutive against no losses. They
took an‘ early 7-0 lead by winning
the ﬁrst even. The Danes tied the

score at eight in the next swim. Joan
Nugent registered the 500 yard free
style win for Albany clocking In at
7:03

Sage took the third, widening the
margin to 16-9. but the Danes con-
trolled the fourth swim as co‘
captain Ann Hoch brought the
score to 20-I4 with a win in the I00
yard free style. ﬁnishing in 1:03.

The ﬁfth and sixth races belong-
ed to Sage. Albany’s Donna
Staracc, who Bingham called a
“good all around swimmer." won
the 100 yard butterfly in l:47.7. but
did little to raise the score which
still favored Sage. 37-24.

The eighth set was diving in
which Albany's Joan Meiklcman
placed ﬁrst. tallying approximtcly
I40 points. Albany now trailed by
only six. 38-32.

It took Ann Hoclr 28.3 seconds
to win the 50 yard free style. the
ninth cvcril. With ﬁrst place in this.
she became the only triple winner of
the meet. However Albany lost the
next four swims and went into the
final diving scrics down. 60-55. This
belonged to Dunc co-captaiu Chuck
Griswald. "a fantastic diver." tit:-

cording to Coach Bingham. Her
ﬁrst place score was 160.25. which
put Albany ahead. 63-61. for the
ﬁrst time in the meet.

Sage took the next swim and went
ahead in the scoring. 68-65. And
then havoc struck for the Danes in
the ﬁnal event.

“We used all I4 swimmers.”
Bingham commented, as she spoke
about a lack of depth on a’ young
team. “But our divers look stong
and our butterﬁy swims were also
good." she said.

She expects a difﬁcult season.
forseeing going right down to the
wire in many upcoming meets. The
team looks foward to tomorrow's
home even against New Paltz
beginning at 2 p.m.

In a game much closer titan the
score would indicate. Potter Club
defeated the Savage Prairie Dogs
l9-6 to win their sccond consecutive
Alumni Quad Football Champion-
ship.

This was the second year in a row

Potter Club Takes Alumni Title

The remainder of the ﬁrst half
evolved into a defensive struggle as
diving efforts by Dog defenders
stopped CIth runners. and timely
Potter Club interceptions by Steve
Barr and Ken Gormau stopped Dog
drives.

Toward the end of the half the
Dogs rnouutcd a well executed drive
using runs by Gclrt Ainbinder and
passes from Mike Ferrcutiuo to Al
Bunslinft. The drive culminated in a
touchdown pass from Fcrrcntino to
Bunshuft. The Cltib defense stop-
ped the extra point try and at liqu
time the score was 7-6 Potter Club.

Potter Club get its second
touchdown on a sweep. with Tom
Clcnry leading the way for Gorman.
The extra point attempt failed. The
ball exchanged hands several times

with no points being scored.

Finally late in the game. the Pot-
tcr club came up with what Dog
Captain Mike Ferrentino would
later call “the perfect play." With
every Dog and several of the
referees blitzing. quarterback Brett
l’ullium clauin flipped a quick slant
pass over the middle to end
"Duke" lovell. who ran un-
molcstcd into the end zone. The
final score was l9-6. as the extra
point failed.

The key to the game was the fact
that up intil the final touchdown.
the game was definitely up for
grabs. Both teams made great plays
throughout the game. At the end
however. Potter Club had simply
made a f cw more outstanding plays
than had the Savage Prairie Dogs.
