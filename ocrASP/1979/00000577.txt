the "selling" of nuclear power to
the American people;

“Your utility bill is not paying
primarily for fuel and labor,” he
said. “Much of it pays for the great
amount of capital that the corpora-
tion has invested in the plant.
Nuclear plants are the most expen-
sive at the front end; construction
costs anywhere from l.5 to 2 billion
dollars." Secondly Ross contends
that it is senseless to invest in a form
of energy that “is soon to be ob-
solete."

Ross concluded that it will be a
struggle to overcome the utility
companies in phasing-out nuclear
power.

“The use of solar power has in-
creased," he said. “it is a normal,
reasonable reaction to the dangers
of nuclear power. However, it is not
worthwhile economically for

“A lot of students, not realtztng
what the class councils do. didn't
add it in themselves," said Wein-
traub. "A lot ofpeoplejust said, ‘a
two dollar optional charge —- I
won’t add it in.’ As a result, classI
revenues went down."

Weintraub feels it was unfair of.
SUNYA administrators to effect
the new billing system without serv-
ing the senior class with ample prior
notiﬁcation. “We kind of felt that
the administration should have let
us know," said Weintraub of the,
class ofﬁcers. “it caught us by sur-I
prise. it affected us. Five Quad

health) insurance company. if it
was going to be changed and affect
us so drastically. they should have

Of Costumed Klanners

iTHACA, N.Y. (AP) Sotne 200
students milled in ithaca College on
Monday urging stronger penalties
against four men suspected for stag-
ing a Ku Klux Klan-type parade on
Halloween.

Seven other students were expell-
ed for the stunt, which involved

wearing robes and marchiilg a
black-faced student with a noose
around his neck. .

About ll a.m. some 200 students
marched from the student union to
the president‘s office, in a move led
by the campus Afro4Latin Society.
demanding the suspended four also

 

be expelled.

night. l0 students dressed in Klan-
type robes. and led the slave-type
character into the college Pub, and
the library. Whenythey were asked
to leave by campus police, they
walked into this quiet village of
26.000 persons at the foot of
Cayuga Lake.

The group is appealing their
disciplinary actions to college Presi-
dent James Whaicn. College
spokeswoman Lee Moss said the
administration had no immediate

reaction to the petition regarding
the four.

One of those suspended, George
Enzian, a senior from lthaca, said
the stunt was done “in the spirit of
Halloween." _

“i'm a Lutheran. There were also
a couple of Catholics and a Jew,"
among the group of white males. he
said.

“if that Jewish person thought

lraniansGo On National Hunger Strike

 

“Demand For The Extradition Of The Shah” ,,

Associated Press

The iranian people began a five-
day httnger strike today to press
their demand for the exiradition of
the deposed shah. thdio Tehran
reported as the occupation of the
Atncricttn Embassy in Tehran went
into its ninth day with no indication
of an end to the stalemate.

iran's new foreign affairs chief
summoned all foreign tinibttsstidors
in Tehran for :1 meeting today in
what appeared to be a diplomatic
counter-offensive against the
United States.

Tehran sources reached by
telephone from lionn, West Ger.
many, had said beforehand they ex‘
pected the lranian official,
Abolhassttn Bani Sadr, to urge that
their governments pressure the
Carter administration to send the

 

ousted Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi to iron.

Reached again afterward, the
sources declined to give details of
the meeting. One of them, a Euro-
pean diplomat. said the am-
bassadors "were given the oppor-
tunity to present their views," but
he said there appeared to be no pro-
gress in negotiations to obtain the
release of the 98 hostages held by
militant students at the embassy
since November 4.

An official irttnian broadcttsi,
monitored in Kuwait, said the
students called for a fast taken up
“by the country as a whole to
underline the strength and unanimi-
ty of the lranian demand for the ex-
tradition of the shah to stand trail
in iron."

Meanwhile. Syrian troops drove

about 40 demonstrating lranittns
from the grounds of the U.S. Em-
bassy in Beirut, Lebanon, Sunday,
and police iii Washington, DC.
drove several hundred nnti-iranian
demonstrators away from lran’s
embassy in tlic U.S. capital. in
Denver, Colorado, on lranizui stu-
dent was lteld for the fatal shooting
of a teenager and the wounding of
two others who police said smashed
a picture window iii the iriinian's
apartment.

Palestinian sources said represen—
tativcs of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the Pakistani,
Syrian and Turkish ambassadors in
Tehran were negotiating for the
release of the hostages in the
American Embassy. and a Saudi
Arabian newspaper reported all or

some would be freed by Tuesday.
But a spokesman at the iranian
Foreign Ministry. reached by
telephone from New York, said
there was no indication of that.
