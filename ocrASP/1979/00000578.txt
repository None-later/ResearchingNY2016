I will never forget the colors. a
kind of twisted rainbow of broken
dreams. as l ﬂew over Jonestown.
Guyana.

The bright. tropical sun radiated
colors from the clothing of more
than 900 bodies still lying there a
few days after the Peoples Temple
mass murder-suicide.

A year later. I still remember
US. troops on the assembly line of
death. removing the bodies.

They wore surgical
because of the smell. rubber gloves
because of the leaking rubber body
bags.

Some of the bags sagged grotes-
quely in their hands. They were too
big for the bodies they held — the
bodies of children who earlier had
swung on swings and played with

masks

dolls.

As the soldiers worked. the sw-
ings hung motionless. A doll lay in
the dirt. '

There were signs of unfinished
business: empty shoes on the cot-
tage steps. wash hanging on
clotheslines. Unmaiied letters to
relatives.

There were messengers of death:
ﬂies. mosquitoes. the lingering
stench.

i remember the words of a US.
Army major at Jonestown after the
last body had been ﬂown out by
helicopter: “it was a very nastyjob.
a disgusting operation. More than
900 people committed suicide in a
very tropical area and it took us six
days to clean it up and that's how
unpleasant it got."

i stayed behind for a time and
walked around the cottages. ran-

sacked by the local people. in a
steady rain.

There in the mud. outside the
cottage of the Rev. Jim Jones. lay
their letters. letters to “Dad.” as his
followers called him.

These ledgers of human emotions
offered some bit of insight as to
why they did it. why they commit-
ted this unbelievable act. Casualties
are expected in wars. There is an ex-
planation for political coverups like
Watergate. But Jonestown was
sheer madness.

The letters. rambling and dis-
jointed. were journals of self-
criticism and evaluation. Jones'
followers wrote of their guilt. of
their feelings of inadequacy. of
their weaknesses. of suicidal im-
pulses and suicide rehearsals staged
by Jones.

Unexplained references were

made to torture. There were com-

" .io—nestown: One Year Gone By‘

plaints that some ate well while the
ﬁeld workers had little —— a teas-
poon of vegetables and maybe two
spoons of rice.

i remember the survivors - 80 of
' ihem.

Jim Hague and his family said
Jonestown was a concentration
camp. The 46-year-old Bogue
escaped: but he told me then that he
too might have drunk the poisoned
fruit drink had he stayed.

i remember sitting on a hotel ter-
race. drinking coffee with Mike
Prokes as I interviewed him. He
was the 3l-year-old television
reporter from Stockton, California.
who had made it back to the States.

He had started out a half dozen
years before to do an investigative
report on Jones and the Peoples
Temple but ended up joining the
cttlt “for idealistic reasons.”

“i think it's dead now." he told
me that day a year ago. "it's just a
legacy ofdeath. l feel the most pro-
found sadness l've ever felt in my

rlife. it will stay with me but I k
i can function with it." now

Four months later. at a news con.
ference in his native town of
Modesto. California. l’rokcs hand
ed reporters 22 pages of ramblin'
thoughts: K

“it is sadness beyond tears to
think of my brothers and sisters
from Jonestown . . . Peoples Tcm.
pic was their only home. their only
family. They are nameless and
alone — forgotten by America."

At the end of the conference
Prokes walked into it bathroom,
shut the door. tttrncd on the Wﬂlci
and fatally shot himscll‘. His witt-

Cracked Nukes

New Scientist magazine reports
that some of the ﬁrst cracks have
begun to appear in the otherwise
solid pro-nuclear line of the French

establishment.

The British scientiﬁcjournal says
that last week. engineering unions
involved in atomic reactor
construction  who are usually
strong supporters of the country‘s
extensive nuclear program —-
opposed the fueling of three new
French reactors.

Electricite dc FrancetE.D.F.). the
French state electricity utility.
planned to load the reactors in order
to add more generating capacity in
time for winter.

However. New St'ft‘lllf.\‘l reports.
the fueling was halted when workers
at two oftltc sites went out on strike
because there were cracks in crucial
reactor components. and the

workers did not want the power
stations started up before the cracks
were repaired.

E.D.F. claims that the cracks are
not serious. and even the unions
reportedly agree that the public is
not at risk. '

However, the strikers are
reportedly worried about the safety
ofworkers. lfthe reactors are fueled.
they claim it will eliminate the
possibility of mending the cracks
before the reactors become highly
radioactive. '

Nowz'pancer From Boer

A study of 30 brands of
American beer by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration has found
that all but two of those brands
contain potentially-dangerous levels
of cancer-causing chemicals.

The FDA released its study
results last Friday shortly after it
was accused of "sitting on" the
controversial report for the past six
weeks by the Center for Science in
the Public interest.

According to the government test
results. the only two beers that did
ttot show traces of “nitrosamines”
(pronounced ni-TRO-sah-means)
were Coors and Guinness Stout.

Other brands of beer in the
government study. including
Schlitz. Tuborg. Budweiser and
Lowcnbrau. registered levels of
nitrosamines ranging from 2 to 8
parts per billion.
