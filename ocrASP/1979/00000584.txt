- Ohio State Slips‘Past . .
Nebraska F or Second Spot

(AP) Alabama's hold on the lead in
The Associated Press college foet-
bal' poll narrowed Monday while
Ohio State slipped past Nebraska in
a lose race for second place.
Alabama squeaked past Loui-
siana State 3-0 Saturday night and
received 34 ﬁrst-place votes and
1,262 of a possible 1,320 points
from a nationwide panel of 66
sports writers and broadcasters.
However, Nebraska dropped
from second to third despite a 21-12
' triumph over Kansas State while
Ohio State pounded lowa 34-7 and
moved up from third to second.

back was nine-for-l7 in tile second
half. and his 187 passing yards pati-
ded the Rams ﬁttal yardage total of
423.

“We could not generate a real
good pass rush," said Ford.
"Shoen was limping, and we just
did not ltave the mobility ill tlte ilt-
sideline to ruslt the quarterback."

“We ltave :t real good offensive
line," said 514 pitan. “i would com-
pare our line to any other teants of-
fensive line."

in bullding up their ill-fated 21-0
halftime lead, the Danes put
together one of their finest 30
minutes of the season. A short drive
ended with 5:11 remaining itt the
ﬁrst quarter when halfback Levi
Louis powered his way into tlte end-
zone from four yards ottt, and after
freshman kicker Tom Lincoln hit
the ﬁrst of his four point aflers,
Albany held a 7-0 lead.

A ten play, 80 yard drive was aid-
ed by Louis' 21 yard run to the For-
ditarrt 21 yard line. From there, the

~ Danes crossed tip the Raul defense

with Walsh's on-targct pass to tight
and Bruce Dey for six points. The
ensuing Albany kickoff was booted
short by Lincoln, and with For-
dhant out of position, Dane deferr-
sivc end Sal Indelicato fell on the
ball on the Ram 42. Albany fought
the clock, and managed to advance
to the Fordltant eigitt yard line.
With just seven seconds ttrtlil
halftime, Walsh fired a low spiral to
split end Scott Luslter, wlto went
down to his knees artd scooped up
the ball in tile cndzone, and the
Danes had their three touchdown
cushion. '

“That might have been the best
ﬁrst half we’ve played all year,"
said Walsh. “We went into halftime
like the game was ours. We thought
they didn't have a chance - we were
probably overconfideltt. Then we
just had a total letdown. A lot of it
could have been from last week - we
felt we were eliminated from the
playoffs. it just didn't matter
anymore."

The season abruptly ended for
the Albany State men’s varsity cross
country team last Saturday after-
noon. The harrlers placed ﬁfth
overall, just missing the fourth
place qualifying position in the
NCAA qualiﬁer in-Binghamton.

Four teams did make it to the na-
tionals: Frcdonia 47, Plattsburgh
82, Binghamton 93 and Rochester
108. The Albany harriers 108 points
enabled them to defeat the follow-
ing teams: St. Lawrence 1'55, RlT
181, Cortland 203, Union 219, RP]
235, Geneseo 284, and Brooklyn
342.

This marked the first time in
tllrec years that the Dane squad fail-

“Surc,.we would ltave loved to

serious question that we weren't a
viable team. We've been runniltg
lturt all season long. One or two of
our runners scented to injure
themselves caclt week. This put a
terrible burdclt on tile rest of the

Women Swimmers Down New Paltz

by Mike Dunne

Dotninatlng the sprint and relay
races, the Albany State women's
swimming team eased past visiting
New Paltz 90-49 on Saturday at
University Pool.

Albany jumped ahead 7-0 with a
victory in the first race of the after-
noon and continued to widen that
margin throughout tltc meet.

The initial win was earned by
Beth Larson, Carol Lim, Attrt
Hoclt, and Donna Staracc who
churned through the 200 yard
medley race in a quick 2211.3 to
start the Danes off on the 41 point
romp.

Starace also copped the 50 and
100 yard freestyle events giving her
a hand in titrce first place finishes.

Beth Larson, Carolyn Sltwidock,
and Carol Lim also swam to sprint
victories under the tutelage of first

Year Albany coach Sarah iiingham.

mance by the entire lentil," boasted

“Myers is an excellent Swimmer.

Albany also took the final relay

The win evens Albany‘s record at
1-1. A protest filed following a cort-
trovcrsial loss to Russell Sage last
Wednesday was not upheld, leaving

missed the nationals by only seven
points. “We are deﬁnitely better
than fourth place Rochester," said
Sayers. “We beat them at the
Albany invitational, but they came
through with their best nteet of the
year. Their strategy was to peak late
in the season while it’s been a long
season for us. We have little depth
after our top ﬁve runners. Bill
Mathis, Scott James, Bruce
Shapiro, Jack Russo and myself
haw: been carrying the team. it’s
impossible for us to keep at a con-
tinuous mental and physical peak.
No one really ran bad, we just
didn't run good enough."

The team was running tired late
in the season. However, it was Scott
Jalnes’ consistency that boosted lite
harriers' efforts. He placed in the
top tltrcc for the team during each
of tlte last four nteets. James refus-
ed to give up despite the team's
mediocre performance on the same
course last Saturday.

James responded with a first
place team finish. He raced over lite
five mile course in a little of 26:50,
artd his llllt place fittislt enabled
ltittt to beconte the sole Albany har-
rier to make tllc nationals in lilinois
this weekend.

Tltis marks the second con-
sccmivc year that James will run in
tile nationals. He placed 166 out of
250 as a freshman last year. He feels

that his domination of the
Binghamton course gave him much
confidence. “The course was
basically uphill for the first two and
one half miles and downhill 'for the
last two and one half miles,” said
James. “1 really let myself go on the
downhill and l surprised myself.
The nationals will be another test of
my speed since it's ﬁve miles of
completely ﬁat road. l’d like to
break at least the 18th position."

Albany co-captain Bill Mathis
ﬁnished only 15 seconds behind
James. Yet the high caliber of the
field prevented him from going to
the nationals. He missed making
the nationals by only one spot. The
17th place finisher, Chuck Ellis of
RlT, made the nationals as he
sprinted by Mathis during the final
few yards. Mathis finished second
for Albany, just two seconds
behind Ellis.

The other eo-captain ran a
courageous race. He developed a
crantp at the two and one half mile
point, and every time he tried to ac-
celerate goitlg down the hill, he ex-
perienced pain. But Russo held on
and finished third for Albany and
2411t OVerall with a time of 27:16.

Rounding out the Albany top‘ﬁve
finishers were Sayers, who finished
fourth and placed ﬁlm with a time
of 27:31 and Shapiro. who placed
