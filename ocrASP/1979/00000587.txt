working to convince prison ofﬁcials
that Muslims deserve the same
religious privileges behind bars as
inmates who are Jewish or Chris-
tian.

In the past. many followers of
the religion were identiﬁed with
Black Muslims, militants who were

viewed by prison ofﬁcials as a
disruptive force. For some prison
guards. the name conjured up vi-
sions of prison riots.

A survey Houlahan conducted
this summer and fall indicates that
Islam is on the rise among inmates
and that federal prison ofﬁcials are
making things easier for worship-
pers of Muhammad.

“i would say membership in

lslamic groups seems to' be on the
increase," Houlnhan said. “There
is renewed interest in historic islam.
American groups are slowly but
surely returning to lslamic roots."

in federal prisons. about [500
prisoners out of .25.000._ or six per-
cent, identify themselves as lslamic.
Houlah/an said. lslamic programs
are organized at 24 of the 38 federal
prisons.

Wallace cited Harvard Universi-

ty. the first academic institution to
establish guidelines.

According to Ernest Volkman‘s
Peuthousearlicle entitled "Spies On
Campus." the Harvard Committee
submitted guidelines which banned
covert CIA recruitment of students
on campus. Harvard staff recruiters
are required to report their involve-
tttettl to university deans.

in addition. the guidelines state
that all aspects of research projects
are to he publicized attd academic
consultation must be reported to
d e a n s .

    
 

According to the article. tltc
guidelines prohibit the secret in-

      

vestigation of foreign students. a
faculty member's recommendation
to a government position without
the individual‘s consent. and fre-
quent CIA debriefing of faculty
members after travelling abroad. ltt
addition. the Harvard Committee
prohibits plopilgillldil writing and
employing faculty itt CIA fronts
without their knowledge.

CAFE Co-chuir Dr. Joseph Wall
said SUNYA should establish
guidelines. "The heart of tire pro-
blem its activity going on itt cam,

people itt it are ttot thill‘L‘ of." ltc
said.

unaware of problems SUNYA has
encountered with intelligence
operations on campus.

Academic participation with in-
telligence agencies “is not a pro-
blem."-Wall said. “In fact, par-
ticipation tnigltt not be bad depen-
ding-on thetactivity.

\ "The great problem is the secrecy
with winch it has been done.” he
explained.

According to Litchford, secret
participation with itttclligettcc agen-
cies may create “conﬂicts of in-
terest. People may ask, ‘Who are
you working tor. the uriivcrsity or
the intelligence ttgency?‘."

A person researching abroad may
be suspected of being an intelligence
agency member. said Litchford. “If
a country believes every person is a
spy, it may litnit people's ability (to
conlittue research)."

He added. “The knowledge ofan
unknown intelligence informers on
campus may ittltibit people's feel-
ings about free speech. free
assembly."

Faculty attd students may be fear-
ful of their chosen independent
research. subject matter. or what
they express in meetings.

Covert intelligence operations on

pus."
