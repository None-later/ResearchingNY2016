Strauss cited recent cases in
which travel agencies were sued
after customers were unable to
make conneciions to New England
Airlines and Eastern Airlines
ﬂights. in each case. he said. the
court found in favor of the travel
agency. stating that the agencies
could not be found at fault for lack
of flight seating when reservation
had been faithfully transmitted to

the airline and were found in their
computers.
HoweVer, Strauss advocated

bypassing the courts and entering
into direct arbitration- with
customers when small losses are in-
volved.

“i ant not against having a com-
rttitntent to arbitrate small claims.”
he said. “if someone loses twenty.
thirty. forty.- fifty dollars to an

agency, they should get it back. No
ifs. ands or buts about it.”

Strauss indicated that the ﬁnan-
cial damage which many travel
agencies would suffer if the Pisani.
Lafayette bill is passed into law
would be more than their budgets
could hear.

“The cost of bonding can run up
a bill for a small businessman." he
said. "A ‘Mom and Pop‘ agency
would be knocked out of
business."

Assembly Committee Cltair Mat-
thew Murphy suggested that the
cost of posting bortds be passed on
to the consumer or shared between
the consunter and the agency.

“We're not really talking about
placittg a large financial burden on
the individual operator," he said.

Strattss also claimed that the bill
would d‘ ourage the opening of

Went agencies licensed for legal purposes

Dear Mom and Dad.

How are you? I'm fine. and the doctor says I'll
feel even better when I get a. few days' rest and
a. couple of home-cooked meals. But with the
condition of my wallet, it looks like I'll have to
hitchhike home for the holidays.

My roommate Just made plans to go home with
Greyhound and says Greyhound is a great way
to fight inﬂation because their fares are
so reasonable.

Greyhound even makes it possible for someone
to prepay a. ticket in one place so someone at
another place can just pick up the ticket and
come home. You can even send along a. small cash
advance with. the ticket. Greyhound will take care
of everything for just a. small fee. Boy —- is my
roommate lucky.

Well, I have to run to pick up some more of that
expensive medicine. I miss you all very much and
hgpgto be home next weekend.

Tho Amityville Hoax

A federal judge in Brooklyn has
stated that parts of the bestselling
book The Antilyvi/Ie Horror are
bunk.

U.S. District Court Judge Jack
Weinsteln made his remarks after a
minister. who is the basis for one of
the characters in the book. testified
that the supernatural events he is
said to have witnessed never hap-
pened.

The Reverend Ralph Pccoraro. at
least according to the book. is said
to hava experienced a series of
fevers. rashes. blisters. open sores
and other supernatural phenomena.
including the cornnntttdcering of his
car by an evil force. This is all said
to have happened to tltc Reverend
after ltc wettt to a Haunted House
itt Long island. New York.

Tltc Reverend Pccorttro testified
to tire Brooklyn court frottt Califor-
nitt by telephone that none of the
events ltnppcttcd to him. He said ltc

lied to California after. the book
was published to avoid annoying
telephone calls and other harass-
ment resulting from the book.

The authors of the best-selling
book on which a current ntovie is
based are being sued on fraud
charges. They claim the book is a
trtte account of what happened to a
fantin during a 28-day stay with
demons and spirits inside the
allegedly haunted house.

“Live” Gone Wild

"Saturday Night Live" producer

Lorne Michaels says that NBC has’

ﬁnally given up its efforts to'censor
the popular late night show.

Michaels says censors have
basically thrown their hands up in
despair and said. “Put on what you
want."

“Saturday Night Live" is
reportedly doing well despite the
departures of Dan Ackroyd and
Julio llclusiti. The first show of the
79-80 season is said to have drawrt
the largest "Saturday Night" au-

‘Dog’gto‘ Diet Dishes

“The Searsdaie Diet” for obese

humans now has a canine'

equivalent: it’s'the' “Topeka Diet”
for fat dogs. '

The New York Times reports that
Riviana (Pet) foods has come out
with the Topeka Diet because there
is an increasing number of
overweight pooches in the United
States.

According to the newspaper, 30
to 60 percent of the American dog
population is currently overweight
— up from 28 percent a decade ago.

The Times quoted veterinarian
Harry Stokler. who is president of
the academy of veterinary nutri-
tionists, as saying that many dogs
are fat because they will eat un-
palatable morseis simply as a part
of social interaction with their
masters. and because the master
“Don‘t like to be told they ltave fat
dogs.“

The Topeka diet is not the only
solution to tltc problem. however.
The Timex says that general foods
and Ralston l’tninn are currently
offering dict dog food.

The Times says. in case you’re in-
terested. Illiil overweight people are
tltc ones who generally own
overweight dogs.
