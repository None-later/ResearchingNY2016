"The

’ Silly
H" man
Race

When we first thought to do a special article on men
and women there were many initial apprehensions.
Should we cover the broad cultural and sociological ef-
fects of the present and ongoing Women's Liberation
Movement? Should we delve into the masculine
psychology to withdraw convoluted Freudian interpreta-
tion of male pride and prejudice? Or should we plummet
ourselves into the religious-philosophical oblivion of the
sexes and, as Norman Mailer did in The Prisoner. of Sex,
derive shocking conclusions on the existence of God in
the mighty and mostly martyred spermozoa and the oft-
maiigned, but enrichingly noble, uterine membranes?
The issue, an eternal one, spans the spectrum of
human experience. Volumes are regularly written on the
differences, similarities, the injustices inequities, the delu-
sions, ambitions of both sexes. And facts roll out of
righteous female heads of rhetoric spouting hatred of all
men for centuries of oppression and rape. While men,
eager to wave their furling egos, hold fast to their cherish-
ed boast of superiority, the last refuge from a past way of
life quickly fading in the moralistic turpitude of the twen-
tieth century.

Men have used women to impose on them, the im-
potence and worthlessness they have experienced in a
dominating society where all has been taken from them,
their power, responsibility, freedom, even the right to go
all the way in the name of God for a greater reward — all
usurped by Technological demons created by us ig-
norantly, regretfully. Unlike man, woman had no class
under her to vent her frustrations except children who are
always the real victims in thisridiculous battle of the
sexes. Within the last century women have rebelled and
demanded what they'deserve, simple, human dignity.
Women can not deny their sex, neither can men. The
human race, both literally and spiritually, depends on the
interaction between sexes. But before 'we can throw off
the dominationand-submission perversity strangling us,
we must understand each other.

How could Sigmund Freud ask, “What does a woman
want”? is the answer so elusive? Can’t we ask as readily,
“What does a man want, what does anybody‘want"?
Respect, freedom, the right to stand in your own light, or
share it for the sake of love, are as desired by men as by
women. And most desired of all is love, for love is hap-
piness, love is truth, love is beauty, love is all. What else
in this sometimes grim, sometimes delightful, always
uncertain world is there but love, finally and absolutely?
