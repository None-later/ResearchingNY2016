(AP) The Indiana Hoosiers, among
the rich kids of the rugged Big Ten
Conference. are the nation's No. I
team in The Associated Press
preseason college basketball poll
for 1979-80.

The Hoosiers. last year's winners
of the National invitation Tourna-
ment, were accordedth honor by a
slim IZ poittts over Kentucky of the
Southeastern Conference. 974 to
962, in one of the closest and most
balanced voting in recent years.

No team in the voting went over
1,000 points. usually a prerequisite
for the leading schools in the poll.
And only one team — third-place
Duke — was named on all 59
ballots.

Indiana rcccivcd I4 ballots for

the No. I spot in the nation-wide

voting by sports writers and broad-
casters. Kentucky collected ]! and
Duke had seven and a total of 956
pomls.

Ohio State, Indiana‘s power-
ladcn colleague in the Big Ten.
received as many first-place ballots
as thc Hoosiers. but only 936
pontts.

Ironically. neither defending
NCAA champion Michigan State
nor Indiana State. which lost to the
Spartans in last year's finals, were
picked for a Top Twenty berth.
Voters obviously dctnurred to thc
talent-drain at both schools — Ear-
vin “Magic” Johnson and Greg
Kclser at Michigan State and Player
of the Year Larry Bird at Indiana

 

 

Penn‘s Quakers, the defending East
Regional champions who lost most
of their starters. were also left out.

The rest of the first-place votes
were scattered among ﬁve teams —
Notre Dame with 9 and North
Carolina. UCLA, DeI’aul and Pur-
due with one each.

Those votcs were enough to help
lift the Fighting Irish into the No. 5
position with 884 points. North
Carolina received 812 .points for
No. 6. Louisiana State was No. 7
with 800 points. UCLA NO. 8 with
631. DePaul No. 9 with 549 and
Louisville No. to with 529.

Purdue heads up the Second Ten
with 472 points. just a neck ahead
of No. l2 Syracuse with 462.

The remainder of the Top Twen-

I(AP) College football starts ﬁlling
its bowls this weekend — six days
before Thanksgiving. Some hearty
.appetites are going to be satisfied,
others disappointed.

A good bet not to go empty-
handed is long-enduring Alabama.
If the nation's No. l tcam doesn't
land automatically in the Sugar. it
should have its choice of the Orange
or Cotton.

Ideally, the bowl matchups
should have national championship
ramifications. On current status.
the gridiron “druthcrs” would send
No. l Alabama against No. 3
Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. No.
2 Ohio State against No. 4 Southern
California in the Rose. with No. 5

Young. with multitalented Marc ,
‘Wilson. is a tremendous wild card
for a major bowl.

But Saturday's games may spoil
the porridge. Last week’s score:
39-1l. .78. The season: .771.

Georgia 27. Auburn 20: The
Bulldogs have the depth and talent.
but only get excited against SEC
foes.

Ohio State 15. Michigan 6: The
Buckeyes. death to lOl.000 hostile
fans. continue to settle old scores.

Texas A&M 2]. Arkansas 15:
Speaking of home crowd advan-
tage. it's big stuff in the Southwest.

Alabama 28. Miami Fla. l4: One
scarc is enough for The Bear, so he
bears down on the team that beat
