LOS ANGELES (AP) Southern
Cal’s Charles White is the nation's
leading rusher this season'and the

second most productive runner'in

college football history, but at least
three people aren’t tremendously
impressed —- Bertha and Jessie Leg-
gett and Charles White.

“My grandparents, Bertha and
Jessie, really aren't concerned with
what l’m doing now in football,"
said Trojan tailback White, who
lived with the Leggets most of his
youth.

“They ﬁgure football is just a
way for guys to have fun on Satur-
day afternoon. and they‘re more
concerned about what 1'" do when l
ﬁnish playing."

White. like his grandparents.
seems generally unimpressed by his
running with the football. He has

“my... .. 

gained 1,650 yards on 258 carries

. this season — an average of 634

yards per carry -- to move him to
second on'. the all-time collegiate
rushing list with 5.404. Tony
Dorsett gained 6.082 yards during
his‘ college career at Pittsburgh.

"i guess l'm my own worst. or
best. critic." said White. a taut-
musclcd six-foot, lBS-pound senior.
"i look at the game films, and i
always see where i could have done
better."

White says he hopes his future
holds. among other things. a vic-
tory for the third-ranked Trojans
over UCLA on November 24. a
Rose Bowl victory on January 1.
and a pro football career. Some
observers -don't think White will go
high in the National Football
League draft. however, since he is

small for a pro running back.

However, Southern Cal Coach
John Robinson has said that pro
scouts observing the Trojans have
their initial thoughts about White.
Whatever the case. White isn‘t tak-
ing anything for granted. ‘

“l’m looking forward to playing
in the pros.” said White, “but i
know making it will be a new
challenge for me. it’s a whole new
everything, it’s starting all over.
You can be a great college football
player and it doesn't mean a thing
after you finish."

“Just in case. l'm making sure
that i get my degree." White said
the 1979 season has had only one

‘ major disappointment for him -
the “loss.” The "loss" he referred
to was actually a 21—21 tie, the only
blemish on the Trojans‘ 9-0-1

“When you're involved for a
long time in a winning tradition.
even a tie seems like losing," said
White, who came to Southern Cal
out of the highly successful prep
football program at San Fernando
High. “i guess you get a little spoil-
ed.” According to Robinson.
White hasn’t become spoiled in any

 
 

 

regard.

"One of the real pleasures abOut
watching Charlie play," Robinson
said. “is watching him when he
doesn’t have the football. He's
blocking. crashing into people. run-
ning around helping people up and
slapping them on the back. l’ve
never seen anything like it."

Hope's humor. never mistaken
for high brow. was tailored for the
college audience, with an emphasis
on sports, and then laundered some
more for television.

At Southern Cal. he said: -“l’m
happy to be here at Charlie White
U.," referring to the Trojans’s
standout tailback Charles White.
-”When Charlie White was in-
troduced to me. he said: 'Hello Mr.

Women Swimmers Optimistic

' Despite 81-51 Setback

by Mike Dunne

it is not often that one en-
counters a losing coach, especially
at the collegiate level. who can un—
cover praise following a defeat.

Albany's women‘s swimming
coach. Sara Bingham. was in one of
those rare moods yesterday. Despite
the fact that her charges dropped an
81-51 decision at the hands of
undefeated Binghamton on
Wednesday. Binghaln found room
to praise her young team.

I'l checked the record book and
found we lost 33-91 to them last
year. We improved quite a bit- and
did it without two key swimmers
who would have scored points for
us. i felt very good about the
meet." said a cheerful Bingham.

Two women spearheaded
Albany’s challenge of Binghamton.
regarded as one of the top women's
squads in the state. '

Albany co-captains Chuck
Griswold and Ann Hock were both
double winners. Griswold
dominated the diving segments by
copping both the one and three
meter heights.

Hoch blitzcd to victories in two
50 yard spriltl races. freestyle and
butterfly, and wasjust nipped in the
100 yard frccstylc dcspitc lowering
her best personal time.

Had Albany fared better in the
relays. where Binghamton earned
l4 points. the mch might have bccn
decided in the ﬁnal events.

travel to Saratoga to face Skidmore
College tomorrow. Bingham ex-
pects this test to “go right down to
the wire.”

She added. “A lot will depend on
how Ann Hoch and Donna Starace
swim. They will face their toughest
competition thus far. it could go
either way."

Regardless of whether her team
comes out on the winning side. it is
likely that Bingham will be looking
at the bright side.

KANSAS CITY. MO. (AP) Kansas

Although many of the events an
