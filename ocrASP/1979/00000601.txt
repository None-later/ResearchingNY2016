Situnping Danes Hope Finale Isn’t Swan Song

by Paul Schwartz

After two consecutive startling
defeats, the sudden plunge out of
the playoff picture. and-still faced
with numerous injuries, the last
thing the Albany State football
team wants is the Springﬁeld
Chiefs. But they are the Danes'
final opponents of the season, and
at Springﬁeld's home ﬁeld tomor-
row. Albany will look to contain

” the powerful Chiefs.

Springﬁeld is a perennial Division
11 force. and after an off year in
1978, the Chiefs are back — a 7-2
record this season. and still in con-
tention for an NCAA Division ii
playoff bid. Springﬁeld has only an
outside shot at post season play,
and will be looking to make a final
impression against tlte 6-2 Division
111 Danes.

"They are an excellent football
team." said Albany State head
football coaclt Bob Ford. “1 just
hope we will rise to the occasion
tomorrow. We are the decided
underdog."

In building their fine mark. the

Chiefs have stumbled just twice,
and botlt times. barely. Against
lthaca. a Division 111 playoff team.
Springﬁeld was beaten 21-14. and
the other setback occurred facing a
strong American international
squad. 34-21. Last week. the Citiefs
displayed their migitt. racing to a
34-0 halftime lead against New
Hampsltire. a strong Division 1AA
team. Springfield cased up in the sc-
cond half, and won 34-14.

The Chiefs' well-balanced attack
features a mammoth offensive line
that includes talent along with their
size. Right tackle Ro‘n Rix (6-4. 240)
leads the unit. but there is no

 

dropoff after him. Tackle Steve
Foster (ts-4, M0), guards Tony
D’Errico (6-3, 230) and Glen Pires
(6-3, 255) and center Mike Duprey
(6-2, 225) add up to an imposing
group. “And it's not just that
they're big, but they're all good."
said Albany coach Hank Hughes,
who scouted Springﬁeld a week
ago. “The key to their offense is
their reat line."

Members of Albany's football team go through drills in preparation for t

 

Directing an offense that has
averaged over 27 points per game is
quarterback Jim Cc'tllls’tS-il, 180),
who has not completed half his
passes during the season, but per-
formed well last week. Collis hit on
12 of 23 of his tosses and amassed
196 yards and three touchdown
passes. While these ﬁgures are im-
pressive, they do not indicate the
dominance the represent. With the

game still in doubt in the first half,
Collis threw for 189 yards against
the New Hampshire defense, and
after owning a big lead. Collis did
not pass often in the second half.
“He’s not ﬂashy, but he gets the
job done." Hughes said.

Utilizing a multiple offense that
runs an option. a wing-T, and
almost everything else. the Chiefs
have shown a potent offense
without the services of their top
runner. fullback George Richard-
son, who has been injured for most
,of the season. Dashing through the
huge holes supplied by the offensive
line is tailback Norm England (6-3.
218). who blitzed New Hampshire
for 159 yards on 31 carries. and he
scored two touchdowns as well.

Coliis’ premier targets are tight
end John Cherry (64, 210) and
wide receiver Kevin Kenyon. Last
week Cherry caught three passes for
73 yards. and Kenyon garnered fottr
receptions for 72 yards.

On defense. Springfield again has
superior size on their line. with two
defensive tackles wlto botlt weigh in
at 240 pounds. Mark Harriman
220) is the Chiefs’ best linebacker,
bttt their tttost outstanding defen-
sive performer is utottstcr back .lack
Quinn (6—1, 205), who was a first-
tcant Division 11 selection as a
junior a year ago. and is regarded as
a professional prospect by sontc
observers.

Adding another dintcttsiou to an
already ntulti—l‘aceted attack is
defensive back Frank Moncllo
(5-10. 185), who also returns
kickoffs. “He is one of. if not the
best kick returner we have seen this
year." said Hughes. “Against
lthaca he returned one all the way

for a touchdown. and he often
breaks runs for long yardage."

indicative of the Springﬁeld club
is their punter, Tony Green. who at
6-4, 270 lbs., can put unmatched
amounts of force behind his boots.
“1 saw him kick four 70 yard punts
in practice last week." said Hughes,
who played for Springﬁeld last
year. “i've never seen anyone kick
the ball higher than he does.”

Tomorrow’s game will be played
on “super turf”, an artiﬁcial turf
that was installed last year. The last
time the Danes played on artificial
turf was two years ago. when
Albany traveled to Springfield in
1977.

“it usually helps us," Ford said.
"We have never lost on artificial
turf, and for the wishbone. it
should be ideal."

For the third week in a row, the
Danes will enter a ballgame plagued
with injuries. Defensive tackle Steve
Sitoen played last week with n
severaly strained ankle. but is
doubtful for Springfield. Corner—
back Jerry Wicrzhicki‘s ankle in-
jury will sideline hint. reserve cor-
tterback Ed Ragulc is ottt witit a
pulled hamstring. and reserve tigltt
cttd Jimmy Johnson, who suffered
a broken nose against Fordham last
'weck, will not see action. in addi-
tion. quarterback Terry Walsh rein-
jured his tettder upper leg bruise,
and as ofWednesday, was 1101 prac-
ticing in pads.

“i don’t know itow we are going
to hide our injuries this week," said
Ford. whose Albany teams have
never lost three games in succes-
sion. Facing Springfield, the Danes
will be hard-pressed to keep that
claim.

Despite Losses, Swimmers Have Strong Nucleus

by Bob iielittflore -
Despite the loss of “three goo

links" from last year‘s team.
Albany State men’s swimming
coach Ron Wltitc expects an

"exceptionally" slow start. bttt a
“winning season."

White. in his sixth year as Albany
coach, cited the transfers of two top
swimmers from 1978-79 and the
decision of a co-captain elect not to
swim as reasons why this squad
might not be as powerful as last

year's (which set six school
records).
f‘The entire team eould've

returned," said White of the squad
that finished fourth of 12 in the
SUNY Conference. “1 expected a
little bit of a stronger team. We
could be a lot stronger than we are.
Every coach looks for that return-

ing team that’s ready to bloom."
Even without last year’s full
team, there is still a core this season
which White calls "a nucleus you
kinda depend on." Led by senior
co-captain Tom Roberts, the Danes
have that kittd of central force
necessary for success. Along with
Roberts, White mentioned senior
Frank Heter, juniors Kevin Altern
and Joe Shore. artd sophomores
Steve Bonawitz and Dave Zybala as
being tltose swimmers who'll be
burdened with most of the pressure

indeed. tltcse nten are capable of
doing the job. as their past perfor-
ntattces show. Altern. along with
placing third in the 101) yard
freestyle itt last year‘s SUNYAC
championships, owns the school
record for the 200' yard freestyle.
Bonawitz lays claim on the top
Albatty times for the 100 and 200
yard backstrokes and was also ninth
in the SUNYACs in the 100; all as
just a freshman. Shore placed sixth
in the SUNYAC 200 yard
breaststroke, and Heter has the
Albany State pool record for the
100 yard breaststroke.

White is confident in his nucleus,
saying “Each one of these guys has
the ability to bounce around from
event to event." Evert with this
core, White expects the most from
Zybala attd ilonawitz. Both heavily
recruited in‘high school. Wltitc
looks to thetn for production.
Zybala, who missed all of last
season with a broken ankle, and a
broken hand at mid-season. was
White's top freshman itt 1978.
“Zybala appears ready for the
test.” said White.

With regards to his other top
rated sophomore, White feels
Bonawitz has improved greatly.

"‘He spent the summer swimming

AAU." White revealed. “1 think
that’s the difference this year. The
summer swimming helped his en-
durance and stamina. He’s now
what 1 call more of a complete

The freshntcn scene is wide open.
with seven or cigltt men trying to fill
up key holes iii the team. especially
lit the backstroke, iudividttal
ntedley. and distance events. iiut
White isn‘t too worried about the
frosh, feeling they have the talent
and “could fill the spots with the
right attitude and determination."

After a “satisfactory recruiting
year." White expects his two pritne
recruits, Kerry Donovan and Bob
Lento. to be factors. “i'nt iookittg
for Kerry to fill in the individual
medley attd middle distance
events." White explained. Lento

might be an answer to the problem
of weak backstrokers.

Wltite concluded that the
strongest events are the free and
breaststrokes. and that the middle
distattce and freestyle races are
superior to the long distance races.
“The event l'm looking to improve
this year." said White. “is the
backstroke."

As far as diving goes. White is ex-
tremely pleased with and excited
about the squad of divers. Accor-
ding to Witite, “Diving has more
depth than we've ever had before.
l‘m impressed with the new coach
(Bruce Sickles) and the enthusiasm

of tlte divers."

Tltc top diver for tltc Danes is
junior Bill Derkasclt. in his third
year on the team. White calls him
“Albany‘s most dependable diver
in the history of our sport. He’s a
tttost dedicated, hard-working in-
dividual." White is also pleased
with junior Tout Baliou and
freshman Jeff Goldberg.

The leader on the team. says
Wltite. is Roberts. “He’s got many
outstanding leadership qualities.
He’s quite capable,” decording to
White.

SUC Cortland Nerospaper

Resumes Publication

 

Renewed Interest Shown By Students

by Karen Flen

After a two week suspension of
publication. The Press. SUC Cor—
tland's student newspaper is
“enthusiastically back on its feet. ”
said Press Editor-in Chief Jamie
Faricellia.

During the suspension period. ex~ '

tending from October 22 to
November 8, the newspaper staff
launched a campaign to increase
student interest in The Press.

Approximately 50 students at~
tettded workshops to learn staff
responsibilities and design and
layout techniques. itt addition" to
learning writittg skills.

As a result of its newly
formulated staff The Press came
back into view on November 9.

The newspaper originally ceased
publication due to an overburdened
production staff, according to an
October 19 Press editorial. Ap-
parently. the editor—in—chicf. the
managing editor. and the business
manager assumed too tuuch respon-
sibility.

“The Press wasn’t representing
the students. The paper was put out

 

by only a handful of people who
couldn't possibly represent the en-
tire student body.” said Faricellia.

in addition. the staff cited a lack
-of cooperation from the college's
Journalism Department.

in the past, said Faricellia. The
Press was not supported by the
department. Newly appointed Jour-
nalism Committee Chair Fobert
Kochersberger has improved

newspaper department relation.
“Cooperation has taken a turn for
the better." said Faricallia.

Kochersberger is attempting to
obtain academic credit for those
who work on the paper. in addi-
tion, he has encouraged Journalism
minors to attend Press workshops "
and submit Press clippings as class
assignments.

Being unable to provide salaries
for managers and editors con-
tributed to a general lack of support
for The Press. “The paper lost
potential leaders to paying jobs.”
said Faricellia.

'rlédndgren Concert Flop .' 7
[Costs UCB Thousands

Failure to “sell-out" for the Todd Rundgren concert has brought.
an estimated $10,000 loss to SUNYA’s University Concert Board
(UCB). according to UCB Chair Evan Gold.

The Thursday night performance, budgeted for a loss of $4,000.
only brought in 1500 spectators, 1000 people less than expected.

"1 don't think Todd Rundgren was a mistake,” said Gold. "Last
year, the show would have been a sellout."

Gold attributed the poor turnout to the current recession which is
forcing concert-goers to be “more selective."

“in the past, people went to all the concerts, no matter who it
was." said Gold. He added a general lack of money will cause people
to pass up a concert “by someone not that well known," although
they may have attended it in the past.

The loss has not cancelled future performances. but. explained
Gold, UCB "will go for something that will sell. People can’t go for
artists who were big once and are on the road now.“

He added that next semester UCB will bring concerts with current-
ly popular bands that have a good basis in album sales. However. up
and coming bands. which usually play colleges. will be iturt by this
policy. “We have to go commercial," explained Gold.

UCB members cited the lack of a large concert facility as one
reason for poor turnouts at performances. Schools with a ﬁeld house
or stadium often guarantee a sellout.

Testing Corps. Alter Exam Schedules

 

GRE’s Trimmed; MAT’s Cancelled

by Sylvia Saunders

As a result of the recently
legislated Truth in Testing Law, the
standardized testing industry will
stop administering certain graduate
school'admission exams.

The law. designed to provide

 

basic consumer protection to test-
takers. requires testing corporations
to publicize test questions and
answers 30 days after exam results
are released.

Unable to comply with the law,
testing agencies have been forced to

eliminate and cltattgc exam pro-
cedures.

The Psychological Corporation,
a testing agency which administers
the Miller Analogies Test
(MAT), the Doppelt Mathematical
Reasoning Test and the Minnesota
Engineering Analogies Test. will
close its New York State controlled
Testing Centers by December 31.

in addition, the Corporation has
ordered all centers. wherever
located, not to report test scores to
any New York State institute after
December 15.

A Corporation spokesman said,
“Although it is our wish to con-
tinue to make our tests available in
New York, we cannot do so because
of the prohibitive costs of develop-
ing a new form each time a test is
given."

“These tests are important.“said
area Educational Testing Services
(ETS) Supervisor Dr. Norman
Greenfeld, pointing out the MATS
as a requirement for admission into
the SUNYA Education, Social
Science. Social Welfare, and
Library Science Graduate Schools.
Each year, he estimated. 300 to 500
students take the exants.

Ofﬁcials from ETS in Princeton.
New Jersey. the biggest test pro—
ducer in the country. have cut their
testing programs by one third. The
February 23 Graduate Record Ex-
amination (GRE) has been cancell»
ed in addition to the elimination of
the general portion of the June 14

' GRE. Only advance testing will be

offered at that time.
“ills goittg to be hard. to work ap-

proximately 1800 students per year
ittto a reduced number of sessions,"

said Greenfeld “More centers will v

have to be set up."

The January and April GRE ses-

sions will be closed to walk-in test-
takers. Greenfeld said he usually

allows “as many as 25 walk-ins at
.

each session.“

ETS has also warned that the he .I

quency of make—up testing days and

special testing sessions for the han- -

dieaoped mav be cut. Greenfeld

said no braille or cassette editions

will be available.

The law means that the security
and validity of the tests is complete-
ly broken and testing corporations
will have to develop a new test every
year.” explained Greenfeld. “This
takes a lot of time and money."

SUNYA NYPiRG Chair Amy
Adeiman said the testing corpora-
tions are “using these new testing
schedules and threats as a maneuver
to get rid of the law.

“We (NYPlRG) never intended
this to happen." she added. “We
wanted this to beneﬁt the students.
instead. the testittg centers are mak-

ing a lot of threats because we are
challenging their authority."

Testmakers who were opposed to
the passing of the bill, claim they
will be forced to raise test fees and
cease administering some tests in
New York. Test corporations must
raise prices to cover the cost of
developing new questions.

Certain examinations will be
withdrawn because the nature of
the test’s subject matter limits the
development of relevant questions.
“There's just so many ways you can
ask a certain question," said
Greenfeld

He argued the legislation does
not address the problem. “l'm not
cottvinced that the law either solves
o_r identiﬁes the problem.

“instead, the law is hurting the
people for whom it was originally
designed.” he added.

“Now there’s one less objective
