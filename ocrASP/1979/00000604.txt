' Belts And Buckles

Have you belted your kids today?

That's the slogan for the latest
public service ad put out and then
quickly withdrawn by the Maine
Transportation Department. '

Transportation officials said the
safety belt slogan scented like a
good idea at first. It was catchy,
clever, and a strong warning to
parents to secure their children well
while traveling.

James McLean of the department
said, however. that all Maine
newspapers that had agreed to use
the ad are now being asked to
withdraw it.McLean said the ad
“was in bad taste."

TV Causes Sexism

A University of Pennsylvania
study just released says that people
who watch a lot of television have
more sexist attitudes than those
who rarely watch it. Researchers
reportedly sampled 3600 people,
and found that those who watch
television more titan four hours a
day scored higher on a test to detect
sexist attitudes.

One of the authors of the study.
Dr. Nancy Signoricili. said that itt
more than 1300 network television
programs tnortitored over the past
10 years, ntctt outnttmbercd women
titrec-to-onc. Women characters
were also less likely to have a job
and tnorc likely to be married than
were male characters, site said.

Alcohol, Driving Do Mix

An alcohol-powered car may be
just around the cortter — for
Brazilians. that is.

Volkswagen, Ford, General
Motors. Chrysler and Fiat are all
working together itt Brazil to turn
ottt an average ot' 300.000 new
alcohol-powered veltieies each your
front I980 through [982. The first
alcohol-powered car is expected to
be on tltc tttarkct within the ttcxt
few months.

Almost all Brazilian drivers are
currently driving cars rising 20 per-
cent alcohol, matle frottt sugar
cattc. in their tanks. By i985,
economists predict that there may
he at least three million cars, trucks.
attd buses -— or about half of the
vehicles on the road itt Brazil —

Galactic Gas Crunch

Could it be that the gas crunch is
a galaxy-wide problem?

The Center for UFO Studies
reports that two Argentine race car
drivers were on the ﬁnal leg of a
39-day stock car race when they
suddenly noticed a strange yellow
attd violet light speeding toward
them.

The drivers claim ihat their
ettginc and headlights went dead,
and that they were lifted off the
road and set down again one minute
later. . . 75 miles to the north. The
two racers also said they discovered
that their car's gas tank had been
completely drained of fuel.

A Nosey Census

The WHO Census may be tnorc
than a way of determining popula-
tiott attd professional shifts iii the
US.

Columnist Sylvia Porter says that
the official census questionairc —
intended for distribution in every
household in America —- will also
be asking Americans some prohittg
qtlcstions about their personal
habits and lifestyles.

According to Porter, among tltc
morc personal questions the so-
callcd ltcad count will ask are: Are
you married to the person you live
with?; How many babies have you
ever had?: Have you any mental or
health problems'!; How much is
your monthly mortgage (or rent)
payment'.’; and How much do you
think you could get for your house?

Itt case you consider this type of
governmental questioning an inva—
sion of privacy attd simply want to
dutnp the form in tire nearest wastc
basket, yott'd better think twice.
i’ortcr says that failure to answer
tltc l980 census questionnaire could
stick you with a federal misde-
meanor cltat‘gc attd a SIOO finc.

Won’t Cure This

Hundreds of residents of tile
community of West Chicago have
been found to have “radioactive
breath."

Scientists at the Argottnc Na-
tional Laboratory ltave been check-
ing the respitatory systems of many
of the residents of West Chicago —
a community which is located about
30 tttiics from downtown Chicago.

West Chicago was once the site of
tire Lindsay Light attd Chemical
Company, a ﬁrm that produced
tons of radioactive orc tailings. Tltc
company was ittvolvcd itt tltc
manufacture of America's first
atomic bomb.

It was recently discovered that
tltc tailings, containing radioactive
tltorittnt, were widely used in the
construction of streets. sidewalks
and buildings throughout West
Chicago.

A test of 204 persons who eititcr
worked at the plant or lived itt West
Chicago has found that virtually all
of them emit small bttt detectable
levels of radioactivity when they ex-
hale. Medical officials say it is too
early to state whctiter the radioac-
tive particles lodged in their lttngs
are doing any serious harm.

   

 

All In The Family

If you think parents are the only
ones who cook for families. you’re
wrong.

Seventeen magazine reports that
its recent survey of teenagers found
that teens are currently preparing
an average of as many as 13 meals
each week for themselves and their
families. '

in case you're thinking teen
cuisine is made from scratch.
Seventeen says that its survey found
that 80 percent of teenage girls who
cook prefer using frozen foods.

Teen cooks. incidentally, are
spending more than $i3 billion
dollars on their culinary skills, ac-
cording to Sevenleen.

Dance Floor
Cutting Boards

if you missed your chance to
boogie on the dance ﬂoor of the
now-defunct Fillmore West, don't
despair: It‘s not too late after all.

That‘s because the Maple Hard-
wood which was once the flooring
of the Fillmore West has been cut
ittto pieces, laminated and hand-
finished into cutting boards for sale
to the public.

The publication Radio and
Records reports that the wooden
mementos frotn the 19605 palace of
rock are being sold as a fund-raiser
by the non-proﬁt Bay Area Marine
ittstitute.

Each of the slabs of wood comes
complete with a “Certificate of
Authenticity," along with an em-
bossed legend that reads: "Recycled
front the dance floor of the
Fillmore West."

The cost? Well, it isn't cheap.
Each finished wooden board goes
for $23.30. which includes tax.
postage. and shipping. And yes —

Zeppelin And Miller
Together

Wltat do Led Zeppelin and 19505
sing-a-long king Mitch Miller have
itt common?

The two recordittg acts are the
only artists ever to place nine
albums on the natiottal LP sales
charts at one time.

With the release of their latest
LP. Led Zeppelin became the ﬁrst
recording group in nearly 20 years
to have nine LPs on the national
charts.

Miller and his “Sing-A-Long
Gang" are the only other artists to
equal the feat. What is particularly

_ #
impressive about Led Zeppelin’i Ec-
tcompiishment is the fact that the
'group halt only recorded nine
albums. ‘

With the exception of their cur-
rent LP. “in Through the Out
Door." Zeppelin's best‘seiiing ,
album is “Houses of the Holy"
'which contains the group's rock
classic "Stairway to Heaven."

“Apocalypse Now”
And Again

“Apocalypse Now" is turning
out to be one of the year's biggest
box office hits. and ﬁlmmaker
Francis Ford Coppola claims the
ﬁlm will never be seen on TV.

instead, Coppola says he will
periodically rc-issue the movie,
predicting that a second release of
“Apocalypse Now" could be even
better than the current release ofthe
hit film. '

Coppola says that he put up
"everything I own” to ﬁnance the
picture. He says he now expects to
reach the financial break—evenpoint
sontctinte in the next 18 months.

According to the entertainment
trade publications. to break even on
the project, "Apocalypse Now"
must bring in a minimum of $70
million at the box office.

Top Secret

The super-secret National Securi-
ty Agency will apparently stay just
the way it is—super secret.

Tltat's because the US. Court of
Appeals in Washington has granted
the spy agency special privilege to
withhold documents from the
public—a privilege that even the
CIA does not enjoy. .

The Appeals Court handed down
its decision in a suit against the Na-

tional Security Agency filed by ac-
tivists Jane Fonda and Tom
ayden.

Fonda and Hayden had sued the
NSA after learning that the spy
agency had compiled foreign in-
telligence reports that mentioned
titem by name. The agency has
rcfttsed to release even a list of the
names of tltose reports to a federal
judge—on the grounds of “national
security."

Three Appeals Court justices
have ruled itt favor of the agency.
stating that the security of the
United States might be threatened if
the NSA is compelled to release in-
formation from its top-secret ﬁles
to federal judges.

In similar suits, involving the
CIA. that agency has generally b.en
ordered to make the top-secret
material in question available to a
judge for inspection. it has then
been up to the judge to decide if
releasing it to the public would
jeopardize national security. '
