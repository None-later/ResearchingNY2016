Rams Over Atlanta By Six In LA

Lori Angeics(AP)Rookic Vince
Ferragamo. making his ﬁrst Na-
tional Football League start, threw
for two touchdowns and set up
another as the Los Angclcs Rams
downed the Atlanta Falcons 20-l4
Monday night.

The victory movcd Los Angcles
into a tie with the New Orleans
Saints for the NFC West lead with
6-6 records. Atlanta dropped to 4-8.

Ferrngnmo. u third-year pro out
of Nebraska, staked Los Angeles to
a i4-O halftime lcnd, connecting
with Preston Dcnnard on a 29-yard
scoring puss early in the first
quarter. thcn hitting Billy Waddy
with a 40-yard touchdown play in
the waning moments of thcppcnlng
half.

Fullbuck Cullen Bryant tallied the
other Los Angels touchdown. sprin-
ting !! yards for the score midway
through the final period. Los
Angclcs‘ 48-yard drive for that TD
was kcycd by an iii-yard pass from
Ferragamo to tight end Terry
Nelson.

The Rams’ defense, which had

" ALBANY STUDENT PRESS

been particularly effective against_
Atlanta's passing game. had to hold
off a late charge directed by
Falcon's quarterback June Jones
lll.

.loncs put the Falcons on the
board with a lS-yard scoring pass to
Wallacc Francis late in the third
period. then marched his team to
another score with 4:]! remaining
in the contest- this touchdown corn-
ing on a 32-yard pass play to Frau:
crs.

A 6-foot-3. 207-poundcr out of
Nebraska. Fcrragnruo was starting
in the place of Pat linden. out for
the rest of" the season with a broken
finger. Ferragamo finished the
game with nine completions in 22
attempts for l7! yards and suffered
one interception. He had been out
of action for a month. nursing a
broken hand he suffered in a game
against the Dallas Cowboys.

Running back Wendell Tylcr led
the ans‘ rushing attack with 2!
carries for it! yards. But he furan-
ed twice to squander Rams scoring
opportunities. '

 

Tyler had fumbled away one
Rams scoring chance on the first
play of the second quarter when he
lost the ball at the Atlanta 1 and it
rolled out of the end zone for a
touchback. in the third period. The
Rams were knocking on the door
again but Tylcr lost the ball and
Mike chc recovered for the Falcons
at their 20.

The Rams victory overshadowed
a fine performance by the Falcons'
Bubba Bean. who gained 104 yards
on !7 carrics and caught two passes
for I" yards.

Joncs, rcplncirrg regular quarter-
back Steve Bartkowski. who is out
with an injured hip, cornplctcd it
out of 24 passes for liii yards but
was intercepted twicc.

Atlanta got the ball back one
more time after moving within six
points of the Rams in the final
quarter. Atlanta held the Rams and
forced a punt, but any chance the
Falcons had to pull out the victory
evaporated when .loncs fumbled
and Mike Fanning recovered for
Los Angcles at the Atlanta 23.

The Studio Theater is small but director

of the actors gather on one side to create the
impression of n crowd straining against police

duvlcu works vcry well. not only because the
actors can perform two actions of once, but
burrnusc this double bombardment augments
