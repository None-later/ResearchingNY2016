 Agent DraftgAlready Gone

(AP) Memo to baseball club
owners: If you want to buy a free
agent. you’d better hurry. Just
about all the top merchandise from
this year's re-entry draft has already
been taken off the market.

Nolan Ryan and_the Houston
Astros were expected to make their
liaison ofﬁcial today, with Ryan
signing a reported four-year, $4
million contract.

Ryan. who became a strike-out
star with the California Angels, start

playing for a contending team near

his home in Alvin, Texas, 60 miles
from Houston, was one of the
prime factors in his decision.

Other players who most recently
signed contracts or agreed to terms
include relief pitchers Al Hrabosky
with Atlanta and Don Stanhouse

./

with-'10s Angeles; starting pitcher
Bruce Kison with Califomia and
veteran slugger Tony Perez with
Boston.

Sources say Joe Morgan, who is
coming off two bad seasons with
Cincinnati, will sign with a West
Coast club this week.

Since the New York Yankees
earlier signed power hitter Bob
Watson and pitcher Rudy May and
the Los Angeles Dodgers last Week
inked starting pitcher Dave Goltz,
most of the top names among the 44
players who went through the re-
entry draft are already accounted
for.

B'sz Picture Anything But Clear

I (AP) Here’s some new math for you
— ﬁnd 30 teams to ﬁll 15 bowls.

You'd think that with 136 major
college football teams to choose
from —' three others are on proba-
tion —- surely 30 would emerge as
bowl-worthy. Thirty teams will
wind up in bowl'games, but whether
all of them are deserving is another
question.

Certainly, some of the bowls will
deserve what they get with all their
wheeling and dealing.

Fifteenth-ranked Auburn's 33-13

victory over Georgia, which
prevented the Bulldogs from clin-
ching a Sugar Bowl berth — was
supposed to clear things up. So this
is what a “clear” bowl picture
looks like, complete with
Associated Press Top Twenty rank-
ings:

Sugar _ Alabama (1) or Georgia

~ vs. Texas (6) or Arkansas (8).

Rose — Ohio State (2) vs.
Southern California (4), if the Tro-
jans beat UCLA next Saturday, or
Washington (16), if USC loses.

James Places 64th In Nationals

continued from page sixteen

tionals capped off an excellent
season. He seemed to be getting bet-
ter at each successive meet, peaking
toward the end of the season while
the team had started to tire. it was
his momentum that carried the
team during the last month.

Scott, or “Houndog” as he is
fondly called by his teammates,
ﬁnished 70 seconds and 63 places
behind the winner of the nationals,
Sebastian Hunt of Boston State.
This margin is not that great con-
sidering the caliber of the race. The

competition was so fierce that each
second made the difference between
two or three places.

James’s time of 25:31.3 was 50
seconds better than his time in last
year’s nationals. He placed eighth
among all SUNY runners and 13th
among all non-team runners. Yet he
still seemed slightly disappointed
that the Albany barriers didn't
qualify. “Next year. we will
definitely make it,” he said. "As
for myself, 1 just want to get better
and better."

Orange —- The Nebraska
(3)-Oklahoma (7) winner vs.
Florida State (5).

Cotton — Texas, Arkansas.
Houston (9) or Baylor (tied for 20)
vs. the Nebraska-Oklahoma loser.

Gator — Michigan (13) vs. North
Carolina. .

Fiesta —- Pitt (1 1) vs. a team to be
announced.

Albany Places 3
On SUNYAC Team

Three members of the Albany
State soccer team have been named
to the All-SUNYAC East Division
team for 1979.

Alberto Giordano (goalie), Alex
Pagano (back) and Afrim Nezaj
(forward) were all named to the
team for the ﬁrst time.

in addition, Robert Dahub
(forward) and Luis Arango (back)
were accorded honorable mentions
by the SUNYAC selection commit-
tee.

Albany placed more players on
the all-star squads than any team in
the East division.

Who's left? h m as!“
A Amon the pitc ers, em -
tractive 8would seem to be Rick
Wise, the veteran who was 15-10
with a 3.85 earned run average for
Cleveland last year. Others
available include John Curtis, Dave
Hamilton, Andy Hassier, Don
Hood and Fred Norman.

Reliever Skip Lockwood of the
New York Mets is also unsigned,
but he has said publicly that his ﬁrst
choice is Boston.

Catcher Milt May, inﬁelders
Dave Chalk, Jorge Orta, Freddie
Patek and Rennie Stennett, out-

‘ Dock Ellis,

‘ fielders Greg Gross, Jay Johnstone.

Rowland Ofﬁce, ,Roy White and
Jim Wohlford and designated hitter
Will Horton look like the best hit-
ters still available.

Other free agents. who received
little or no attention at the draft and
remain unsigned, include Jesus
Alou, Paul Blair, Glen Borgmann,
Tim Johnson, Jim
Kaat, Don Kessinger, Ed
Kranepool, Lcrrin LaGrow, Bob
Montgomery, Lenny Randle, Merv
Rettenmund, George Scott. Tony
Solaita, Rusty Torres, Wayne Twit-
chell and Bobby Valentine.

team of their magnitude — you just
can’t do that. I would say based
upon our defensive performance.
the score shtiin have been 17-0, not
31-0."

The convincing setback was the
conclusion of a drastic turnaround
in the Albany season. After toying
with their ﬁrst five weak op-
ponents, the Danes were matched
with Norwich in the first tough
game, and Albany came up with a
comeback 28-25 victory, and as a
result soared in Division 111 polls.
But physically beaten and emo-
tionally drained, the Danes had
nothing left when they faced lthacu
the following week, and lthaca gave
the Danes everything. a 46-6
beating and a swift boot out of the
playoff picture. Then Albany con-
tinucd their downward swing,'los-
ing a 21 point lead and a ballgame
to Fordham. and ﬁnally, were
shutout for the first time in four
years by Springfield.

“1 never want to get in the situa-
tion where we go 6-3 and we start
screaming and kicking in lockers,"
said Ford. “Mike Motta (offensive
coordinator) and Jack Siedlecki
(defensive coordinator) and 1 got

together after the Springﬁeld game,
and we asked ourselves, ‘Did we get
the most out of the talent we had?‘
We all agreed that unless we were
totally healthy, we couldn't have
beaten lthaca or Springfield. if we
had done a better job of recruiting.
maybe we could have beaten them.
Those two games highlighted our
weaknesses. To be successful, we
must intensify our recruiting effort.
We must have better personnel at
our second-string spots.

“I guess l’m disappointed, but if
you take our three losses and
dispersed them, it wouldn't have
looked as bad. This way, it looks as
if the whole program collapsed. But
if we played Springﬁeld the second
week of the season. we probably
would have also lost. The way our
schedule fell, we had five easy
teams ﬁrst, and then we had, by
far, four tougher teams. We had to
stay healthy. and we didn’t. in the
state we were in, Ithaca and Spr-
ingﬁeld were just plain better foot-
ball teams than wc were. Fordham
is where l have regrets. That game
came at a bad time. I think we got
the most of our talent, but l’m still
disappointed. l'm not happy. and
1'" never be happy until we win the
national championship."

' Coast Guard  Relays; A

by Jeff Schadoff

Last Saturday, the Albany State
men swimming team hosted the
10th Annual Great Dane Relays,
and there were few exciting or sur-
prising Dane results to speak of, for
the meet was dominated by the
Coast Guard Academy for the se-

.: and year in a row.
Last year, the Cadets of Coast
uard pulled out a less convincing
' ictory over the ﬁeld of seven four-
' . i ear schools with a winning margin
_- eight over second place McGill,
' -52. Albany fared fourth last year

‘ » ith a score of 35.
This year's relays were a different
ory. There were “some key in-
uries and some disappointments
‘lready this season. This deﬁnitely
: as a key factor," according to
bany head swimming coach Ron
White. “We didn't have our com-
, etc team. in the future we need

7 With Coast Guard on top with

02 points, the rest of the four-year
college results as follows: McGill
University 70, Vermont University
66, RPl 58, New Paltz 46 and
Albany State 44. -
I Remarking on his team’s last
place ﬁnish, White felt that “the

l, two disqualiﬁcations in the 300 yard

breast stroke relay and the 200 yard
freestyle relay put us out of ﬁfth
place."

. In the two-year college division.
Morrisville C.C. came out on top
with a point-score of 54, followed
by Orange C.C. with 32. Farm-
ingdale 25, and rounding out the
field was Cobleskill with 18 points.

The intensity at University Pool

"increased as each school was in-
“troduced with their respective
coaches. Each school seemed to
have their own “psych song" that
was highlighted by McGill Universi-
ty's rendition of their National An-
them, “Oh Canada."

The festivities began with the 400
yard freestyle relay, in which the
Dane Relays record of 3221.7 was
held by Coast Guard. This year
McGill University had the best seed-
ed time in the event with a 3:210
but Coast Guard came out on top in
this event in 3:22.7, followed by
McGill one second later. Orange

C.C. came out on top in the two-
year division with a time of 3:32.].
“The 400 medley and 400 freestyle
are approaching good enough times
to gd to the nationals," commented
Albany swimmer Steve Bonawitz.
The next event was the 300 yard
breast stroke relay, in which Ver-
mont took high honors with a
3:17.7, just 1.1 seconds over the
Relay record. Morrisville took the
two-year school heat with a 34:42.5.
The third event was the squeaker
with McGill coming out on top. in
the 300 yard butterfly relay with a
new Dane Relay time of 2:49.6, just
edging out Coast Guard. The new
record crushed their own record set
last year, pulling in with a 2:52.4.
Again, Morrisville won the event
easily with a time of 3106.8.
Heading into the second-third of
the scheduled nine events, the
Danes again found trouble in the
300 yard backstroke relay. This
time, RPl won the event in record-
breaking fashion with a time of
2255.6, more than two seconds
ahead ofsccond place Coast Guard.
The new meet record sliced just
more than one second off the 1978
record held by Coast Guard, a team
that has six meet records of the total
nine events. Again on top in the
two-year college division was Mor-
risville, clocking in at a 3:385
Next up was the 800 yard
freestyle relay that saw Albany fare
quite well in the field of six. The
Danes placed third behind the again
record-breaking Cadet squad, who
broke their own record by almost
two seconds with a 7:36.0.\Orange
C.C. showed the best community
college time with an 8202.4.
Possibly the most interesting, yet
definitely not the most exciting was
the diving event which was taken by
New Paltz in the four-year and
Morrisville in the two-year, with a
rather mediocre overall perfor-
mance by all competitors. An array
of "belly-whoppers" and just plain
bad dives kcpt possible good scores
quite low. Albany diving coach
Bruce Sicklcs revealed that “it was
every Albany divcr’s first meet in
competition. Overall. they were
good (finishing fourth). it takes
more experience to get better in

ing out McGill 1:33.9 to 1534.9. '

The last event, the 400 yard
medley relay, composed of Steve
Bonawitz, Frank Heter, Kevin
Ahern and Dave Zybala for
Albany, was the only race that
merited an outstandlpgRelay per-

‘ fonnance. Dane co—captain Tom
Roberts felt, “They all had fan-
tastic splits on the 400 medley."
Consequently, the Danes were edg-
ed out at the ﬁnish. “They just
outswam us on the last lap,” com-
mented Heter.

Finishing the last event, the
Danes needed a ﬁrst place to
salvage a ﬁfth place ﬁnish and stay
out of the cellar. The Danes came
just three-tenths of a second shy of
Coast Guard's 3:51.5, with a
25:51.8.

White felt that “the guys who
scored high are competitive.
Overall, l’m satisﬁed. The Relays
that were loaded (400 yd. medley
and 400 yd. freestyle) and our
depth, came through for us."

After the meet, Heter reﬂected
on the ﬁnished meet and the up-
coming ones: l‘We'll deﬁnitely

competition. For the ﬁrst meet they
did pretty well."

Adding to their list of records
was Coast Guard, as they took the
600 yard individual medley relay
with a time of 6125.0. Orange C.C.
took a ﬁrst in this event with a time
of 7:075.

Morrisville and Orange shared
high honors in eight of the events

'with each school taking ﬁve and
three ﬁrst place wins, respectively,
'with the only remaining first place
ﬁnish awarded to Farmingdalc in
‘ the 200 yard freestyle relay.

in the 200 yard freestyle relay,
Albany, for the second time was
disqualiﬁed for leaving too early on

third swimmer. None other than

in a dual meet this "nucleus" is
spread out throughout the events in
the meet and gives us a better op-
portunity to display individual
talent."

Next swim meet for the Danes is a
trip to McGill in Montreal for the
McGill Relays November 30. The
Danes did not place too well last
year at McGill but Ahern stated
that “we‘re looking forward to
good times in our relays this time."

Skidmore Drops Women Swimmers

by Mike Dunne

The inability to win long distance
and relay races was once again the
major factor in the Albany
women’s swimming team‘s 73-68
defeat at the hands of Skidmorc on
Saturday. Albany is now 1-3 on the
season. -

As was the case in Binghamton
last week, the outcome of the meet
was determined in the 400 yard

.

/ freestyle relay — the ﬁnal event.

‘ With all other races completed
Albany held a 68-66 lead before
Skidmorc captured the relay and in
turn the meet with a seven point vic-
tory.

“Despite the loss our time in the
relay was good," said Albany swim-
ming coach Sarah liingham.

Ann Hoch once again led Albany
with a victory in the 50 yard butterf-

PREPARE FOR:

ly, a sprint. in which she is
undefeated this season.

A school record was broken by
Albany’s Carol Lim who shattered
the 50 yard breast stroke record of
38.6 seconds, lowering it to 37.5.

The only other swim victory for
Albany came wlien Beth Larson
took yet another sprint by winning
the 50 yard backstroke.

Cp-captain Chuck Griswald
dominated the (living competition
for “the second consecutive meet.
She won both the 1 meter required
and optional events.

Although Karen Kicnzie and
Carolyn Shwidock were impressive
in the 500 yard freestyle race, it was
Albany's inability to score heavily
in the middle and long distance
races that prevented them from
coming out on top.

“Right now the won-lost column
isn't so great but we’re on the right
track. Again many times came
down which is encouraging and
Carol broke a school record. We
still have three months of hard
work aheadﬂf said Bingham.

Having began their season with a
heavy schedule of four meets in two
weeks including back to back lr‘ 165

Wishes everybody a
Happy 'l‘urlseypaytt

on the road, the team would seem
to be looking forward to a short
break —- at home.

They will, in fact, get that much
needed rest this week. However,
when they return they face the cold
reality of three of their next four
meets on the road. All are long
treks to the cold north — Platt-
sburgh, Potsdam and McGill
University in Montreal.
