weary Danes Close Out By Being Shut Out, 31-0

by Paul Schwartz

SPRINGFIELD — On a crystal
clear Fail afternoon, on a carpet-
like artiﬁcial surface, the Danes“
football season came to an end. but
it was not a pretty picture. Albany
battled with the Chiefs for one half.
but a ‘zperior Springﬁeld squad
then ﬂexed their muscles, and broke
open a 3-0 halftime lead into a 31-0
victory over the weary Danes on
Saturday.

For the ﬁrst time in their football
history. the drubbing left Albany
with three consecutive losses. and
dropped their ﬁnal record to 6-3.
For Springfield, the contests mark-
ed the conclusion of a banner cam-
paign. The Chiefs" 8-2 mark was
their ﬁnest since 1965, and the Divi-
sion ll club also established new
team season rushing and total yar-
dage records, both of which were
set in the fourth quarter of Satur-
day's game.

"Before we went out for the
game. we said to the players ‘Herc's
what we have to do to win this
game’," said Albany State head
football coach Bob Ford. “We were
probably three touchdown under-
dogs. We had to execute damn-near
perfect, we had to have a total ef-
fort front each player. and third. we
had to go out and enjoy the football
game. And l‘m as proud of this
year‘s team as any other team we've
had. Our defense played the ﬁnest

first half we've played all season.
but our offense just couldn’t
generate enough. i felt bad for the
seniors —- that they had to go out
this way ~ but over their careers.
they’ve had so many thrills and
great baiigamcs.”

Although the contest was
scoreless for the first 29 minutes,
the Chiefs held a decided edge. if
the Danes were playing a solid
defensive ﬁrst half. Springﬁeld's
defense was.utteriy flawless
throughout the game. A nine yard
run by halfback Levi Louis with
five seconds remaining before the
half nudged the Danes into positive
total yardage, and also gave Albany
their only ﬁrst down in the ﬁrst
half. And with the tiring Dane
defense forced to be on the ﬁeld the
majority of the time. the Chiefs

began to dominate behind their
huge offensive line, and used the
ﬁnal half to score 28 points, 21 in
the fourth quarter.

No..team has ever stopped the
Danes as cold as Springﬁeld did.
Terry Walsh started the game at
quarterback for Albany, but his
bruised leg forced an early exit, and
brought on Mike Fiorito, then
Walsh again, and ﬁnally. freshman

Tom Pratt. The Dane offense simp-
ly could not mount a serious scoring

threat, with their furthest penetra»

tion the Springﬁeld 32 yard line.
Statistically, the numbers were
devastating: Just 50 plays from
scrimmage, 29 rushing yards, 53
total yards, three ﬁrst downs, and
0-11 on third down conversions.
The Chiefs' numbers bespcak their
total control: 88 plays from scrim-

mage, 269 rushing yards. 370 total
yards, 21 first downs, 6-15 on third
down conversions. Albany’s
leading ballcarrier was Jack Burger,
with six rushes for 18 yards.
Tailback Dave Godin of Springfield
tallied 137 yards on 31 carries, and
scored three touchdowns.

The Danes had two moderate
cltances to score in the first half.
Tony Green's 30 yard punt was
ttrrned into a diving fair catch by
Albany's Don Bowen on the Dane
49, and an interference penalty
quickly moved the ball to Spr-
ingfield's 36 yard line. Looking for
a sudden big play, Ford called for a
split end reverse. But Chief defen-
sive end Tom Wisnowski was also
looking for a big play, and his an-
ticipation left him waiting for Scott
Lusher, and he dropped the Dane
for a four yard loss. Fiorito then
overthrew tight end Brucc Dcy, and
Albany was soon forced to punt the
ball away. On the next series, Chief
fullback Lonnie Burgess futnbied.
and Dune cornerback Joe Rajczak.
who was around the ball all game
and had an outstanding final per-
formance, recovered on Spr«
ingficld‘s 32 yard line. This oppor~
tunity was immediately wasted. as
liiorito's pitch to Sam Haistion was
high, and by the time split cnd Tim
Votraw was able to fall on the
botrncing football. the Danes had
themselves a 15 yard loss and a lost
scoring chance.

The only poirus of the first iralf

came after a 14 play. 82 yard drive
by the Chiefs. Getting Springfield
in ﬁeld goal range was a pass play
from quarterback Jim Collis to
tailback John Gusti. Faced with a
titird-and-sevcn situation, the lef-
thanded Collis ﬁred a high toss over
the middle, where Gusti leaped and
stretched as far as he could to tnakc
a diving grab for a 24 yard pickup
to the Albany six yard line. From
there. Collis looked to throw again,
btrt slipped as he faded back. and
linebacker Steve Dcy tackled Collis
for an eight yard loss. With 55
seconds left iii the half. Springfield
put up the first points of the game,
as soccer-style kicker Jim Oliver
booted a 30 yard field goal. the first
of his career, and the Chief's ended
a lackluster first half with a three
point lead.

in the second half, the Chiefs
went 87 yards on their initial posses-
sion after halftime. and after
Godin‘s onc yard pltrttgc gave Spr-
ingfield a lO-O advantage, the Chief
fight song could be heard at regular
intervals. as the touchdowns piled
tip. With it fumbles (four lost
possessions) and one interception ill
the game, Dane turnovers virtually
handed Springfield two scores in
the final quarter.

“There's no question that they
wore tts down," said Ford. “Thcy

(Dane Basketball Squad i
Opens Season Nov. 28th

With seven returnees from last year's squad, the Albany State
men's varsity basketball team opens their 1979-80 season on Wednes-
day, November 28 in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania against Kings Col-

Last season. the Danes rolled to a 20—7 record. including a playoff
selection to the NCAA Division iii Southern Regional, witcre
Albany was defeated in the ﬁrst round by Savannah State in over-
time. Back from the team that won 20 games for only the second
time in Albany basketball history are: Guards Rob Clune, Lee Gard-
ner. Dave Przybylo. Forwards Ray Cesare, Pete Stanish, Steve Low.
Center Kelvin Jones. Also back is Winston Royal. who started at
guard for the Danes two years ago, but took a year off school to cap-
tain the Dominican Republican National Basketball team. Moved up
from last seasons junior varsity team are guard Marty McGraw, for-
ward Ron Simmons. and center Joe Jednak. Transfers Bob Collier
and John DeLosa round out the squad.

On Saturday, the Danes traveled to Waltham, Massachusetts to
scrimmage Bentley College, and Albany fared well against the
powerful Division ll Falcon squad. in the three 20 minute halves, the
Danes were edged 93-92 in the first two halves, and then were
outscored 43~34 in the ﬁnal period.

After scrimmaging LeMoyne tonight and their opener against
Kings next Wednesday, Albany stays home, as Oswego enters

pcct."

lie might have been prepared,
but James was still at a disadvan-
tage. He didn't have the benefit of
his teammates’ inspiration. The
barriers hadn't qualified for the na-
tiottals by virtue of their ﬁfth place
showing at the New York State
meet.

Three of the four SUNY teams
which defeated Albany at the New
York State meet had a rough time at
the nationals. Fredonia finished a
respectable sixth, yet they were a
distant 139 points behind the winn-
ing team. North Central, with 85
points. Plattsburgh ﬁnished 17th
with 433 points, Rochester ﬁnished
23rd with 566 points and Bingham-
ton ﬁnished 26th with 633 points.

The race emphasized speed rather
than endurance. The 4.96 mile
course was completely fiat. Jamcs's
task seemed tough as he was forced
to change his strategy. He had to
run all out from tltc start instead of
gradually passing runners on the
hills. James started out at a fast
pace. His split time for the first time
was 4:40, and he was in 13th place
at that time. He was moving too
rapidly, yet if he had slowed down,
even for ﬁve seconds, ten runners
would have passed him. Runners
were going faster and faster and
there was no time even for brief
rests.

He was able to contintrc running
at a five-minute per mile pace up
until the three mile point. James
was trying to maintain position
from there until the end of the race.
“i just wanted to go with the fiow.i
usually don’t start out that fast. But

. "HAS ‘2‘” ‘- ﬂ...ln-‘

l was in a great position after tltrcc
miles. | just had to hang on,"
James said.

James ran the fourth mile in 5:23.
Some 20 runners had passed him,
and lie had to pick up his pace to
finish under his goal of the 80th
position. He ran the last mile much
faster. yet he saved enough energy
for a filial sprint. After starting his
kick within 50 yards of the finish
line, James passed five men in the

' last ﬁve seconds. it enabled him to

finish 64111. 14 places below his
goal.

“1 ran the best race l’m capable

of,“ said James. “This was the first
time that i really finished tired. i
just couldn't push myself any fur-
ther."

Albany cross country coach llob
Mttnscy was eluted about his run-
ner's performance. “l‘rn pleased
with him," Munscy said. “He rcal-
ly did a great job. A few people
passed him during that fourth mile,
but he kept his cool. Scott finished
loose and in complete control of
what he was doing. it took a lot of
guts for him to hold his ground."
