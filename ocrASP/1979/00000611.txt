‘ Carter Resolves ToF HoSta’ges 

 

WASHINGTON (AP) President
Carter said Wednesday he is grimly
resolved to win the freedom of
American hostages in Iran. but he
warned the American people that
“our detertnirtation ntay be even
more sorely tried" in days to come.

It] a nationally televised news
conference. Carter pledged that tlte
United States would never yield to
blackmail. And he said the takeover
of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by
Islatnic militants "shocked the
civilized world." '

The president condemned the
Iranian regime as being outside

civilized norms. '

“There is no recognized religious
faith on Earth which condones kid-
napping." Carter said.

“There is no recognized religious
faith which condones blackmail.

“There is certainly no religious
faith on Earth which condones the
sustained abuse of innocent peo-
ple."

Carter told the ttation the 49
hostages held at the U.S. Embassy
are being kept "in inhuman and
degrading conditions."

The president said his administra-

Sigtna Tau Betti. a fraternity on
campus. Itad organized the protest
which was partially sparked by an
incident in which one of their
"brothers" was supposedly jumped
on campus while ptttting tip anti-
Iranian posters.

"He followed tttc. hit me, and
threw my posters on the ground. He
told tttc he was an Iranian student
and that he’d see me at the meeting
ater. He ncvcr showed." cxplained
Mike Losak.

In one day. activism exploded
with a vigorous and youthful zeal
on campus. Reasons, rights; only
one thing remained clear to all.
Students haven't seetncd to become
apathetic after all. Said one rallier
Wednesday. “We just needed a
push and now the shit is coming
down."

  I  “Iranian Regime Is Outside Civilized Norms”

tion “will persist in our efforts until
every American has been freed. and
again warned the Iranian govern-
ment of “grave consequences" if
the American captives are harmed.

“Any claitn raised by Iran will
rittg hollow while innocent people
are biottnd. abttsed and threaten-
ed." he said.

At the same time, he made it clear

he was reserving strong measures
against. Iran it the hostages are
harmed. r

f‘The United States has other op-
tions available to it. . .but I think it
would not be well advised to discuss
them."

He said he could not lay down a
deadline because to threaten
military action at this point “might
result in the harm or death of the
hostages."

Carter took full responsibility for
admitting the deposed shah of Iran
for cancer treatment. And he said
the cx-rulcr would decide when to
leave the United States.

The militants who seized the cm-
bassy have demanded that the

I 2
United States extradite the shah no
' that he can rbe tried f war
criminal in Iran.  . " '

Carter said the decision to admit
the shah was made “without
pressure from anyone," including
former Secretary 'of State Henry
Kissinger. and that the medical
treatment the shah is receiving in a
New York hospital was necessary to
save his life.

“i have no regrets about it. no
apologies to make." Carter said.
“because it did help to save a man's
life and was compatible with the
principles of our country."

The president's condemnation of
the Iranian regime was his harshest
since the embassy takeover Nov. 4.

President’s F oe’s Back Him On Iran

WASHINGTOMAI’) Congres-
sional leaders arid rival presidential
candidates offered itntttediatc arid
universal praise for President
Carter‘s remarks blasting Iran's

“Tonight. as fot the last 25
nights, America has btit one presi-
dent." said Sen. Robert Dole.
R-Kans.. a frequent critic ol' ad-
ministration foreign policy and a

Assistant Senate Majority Leader

Carter's news conference
statements. in which lie rcsolvctl
that the Uttilcd States would never
submit to blackmail. were "in ac-
cord with the national will.“

Shortly before Carter spoke.
both houses of Congress
unanimously passed a resolution
backing the president‘s position and
calling on the United Nations

Security Council to "take all
measures necessary" to bring about
the immediate release of the
hostages.

Carter asserted his determination
to win freedom fro the 49 hostages
by pursuing peaceful negotiations
in his remarks and he won praise
even from some of his usually har—
shest critics.

“He has my support and lie is en-
titled to the sttpport of all the
American people." said Republican
candidate John Connally. cattl-
paigning in [)ubuque, Iowa. "We
only have one president. Now is the
