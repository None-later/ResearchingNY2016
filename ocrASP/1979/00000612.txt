imately seven students remained all
night.

According to Albany Student
Union (ASU) Chair Jeremy
Carlsort. they decided to protest
bookstorc policies tltc following
day as an initial step itt changing ad-
ministrative policies.

Approximately 12 people began
the shin 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.
chantittg “Don't buy books from
crooks." and distributing Ilycrs
with their demands to passcrsby.
They threatened to enter the
bookstore at the 5 p.m. closing time
if changes were not rttadc.

However. bookstore manage-
ment kept the store open while
rcprcsctttativcs rrrct with Urtivcrsity
Bookstore Managchttry Dean and
lichen Regional Director John
Balagna. who coincidentally arrived
during the shin.

Student representatives itrfortncd
the protestors of the concessions as
they were made.

“I'm still itr a state of surpris'c."
said Dean. clairrring he did not ex-
pect tltc concessions to be tnadc so
suddenly. “I was kind of surprised.
It was ‘bang.’ like that."

He said while several students rt:-

quested bookstore information
earlier in the year, no one had ap-
proached him recently to discuss
problems.

“I’m not sure where we're going
to dig up the money to pay for all
this. Our income has been reduced.
We‘ll have to look to see where this
will take us." added Dean.

University Auxiliary Services
(UAS) General ManagerE. Norbert
Zaltm.'said. “I'm surprised it hap-
pened so suddenly."

He explained that UAS was
aware of thc problctns but thcr were
difficulties itt resolving them “over
night."

He cited such problems as stu-
dent abuse of the refund policy. "It
(bookstore) can't be a library. A
student will read a book for five
days. bring it back, and get the
money back.

“There are built-in problems.
You wattt to sell. not lend otrt attd
btty back. There's an expense in-
volved. It brings prices down while
you're trying to bc'compctitivc.” ltc
added.

In addition. supplying book lists
is a problem. Zahm said. because
faculty do "()1 send in book orders
soon enough.

Zahrii’a‘ddéd the bookstore sells
textbooks at publishe‘rs' prices. He
explained. however, reducing non-
book items to prices similar to those
of discount stores is impossi-
ble. "To think the bookstore can
be a discount store can’t happen. It
certainly can't compete with stores
like K-Mart." he explained.

Zahm could not provide a time
when the problems would have been
resolved if there had not been a
demonstration. ’

According to SABookSlOI‘c In—
VFSiiBaliontChair Gary Schatsky.
conc‘cssions still need to be nradc.
He explained students wanted a “ to
percent discount across the board"
of all non-book items rather than
just five.

Schatsky added the bookstore
makes approximately 40 to 55 per-
cent profit on many non-book
itcms.

Durittg the meeting. Balagtta
argued that such a reduction is not
feasible because Follett makes only
a 1.1 percentage of gross stiles. This
means the company receives tltrcc
artd a half percent interest on cur-
rent investment returns.

Schatsky said the officials
“lied.” citing if the mottcy was
placed in a bank. tltc company
would receive 13 artd a half percent
interest. Ilc added Follctt grosses
$2.2 million annually in sales.

' Dean said items that “take awhile 5
to sell" have a high proﬁt margin.
“Faster selling items have almost no
markup." He added there are not
many items in the store which pro-
vide a high proﬁt percentage.

Schatsky added although non-
book items were expensive. the
bookstore is making only a 20 per-
cent profit on hard cover textbooks.

“You can't scream I want to
lower prices. You- have to know
what you‘re doing. If you ask for 5
l5 percent discount on books. it will
reduce profits for the company.
They'll leave. And then you'll a

Schatsky. '

Schatsky, who has been in-
vestigating bookslorc alternatives.
pointed out if Follett fails to meet
the demands. other options can be
considered. such as a campus group

‘ selling notebooks at one ltalf the

price of those itr tltc bookstore. “It
will cut the profit margin." ltc said.
Another possibility is working

 

cooperative. _ . . V a: ,
Schatsky pointed out the SUNY
Binghamton bookstore; headed by

,the Auxiliary Campus Enterprises,

which supplies a lo to Is percent
rebate on paperbacks and hard-
coveer texts respectively. “The
store looks at its profit ﬁgure and if
its over. students get a percentage
back."

Schatsky, however. does not:
belcivc the sit-in brought about the
changes. He explained the problems
had been “discussed over a year
and a half of meetings "

“They could have blown up the
bookstore or the campus. It
wouldn't have mattered. Nothing
would have happened unless the
director came," said Schatsky.

According go Carlsen. the sit-in
was one of many demonstrations
that will be staged by the newly
formed organization.

“We want to see the group
become an organized force on com-
ptts. We want students to work
together. to joitr together. llecause

with another company or creating a if tltcy are joined. we will have a
strong force." Ire explained.

Another pro-American speaker.
Richie Hillcr said, “If we succumb
to lraniatt blackmail a precedent
will be set and every two-bit country
will think thcy can get whatever
they want frorn thc U.S."

After listening to the pro-
Amcricatt view a large segment of
the audience left shouting. “The
rest is propaganda and gibberish."

Other socialist speakers con-
tinued and a heated debate followed
the speeches. The largely pro-
Amcrican audience. which had been

marrn.

When asked if her major concer-
nitt returning the Shah was that be

replied. “No.” Her major concern
was the release of the hostages."

Zinunermann said her main con-
cern regarding the return of the
Shah did not focus his receiving a
fair trial. Instead. she expressed
concern over the release of the
hostages.

After the meeting. Zimmermann

have," said Rubin. “The United

States is very powerful. . . it
doesn't have to prove its power by
dropping bombs on Vietnam.

Rubin called Vietnam a
“self-destructive war.”

Vietnam was "the genocide of
American youth." said Rubin.
“We were lied to about ‘body
counts.‘ We were led to believe. due
to bureaucratic egos. that more of
the enemy were dying."

Rubin continued with a discus-
sion of American involvement in
Cambodia. ('hilc. and
Iran. “Kissinch has the blood of
(.‘hilc. of Iran. and of Cambodia on
his hands. . . and Nixon directed
bombs at Cambodia for thrcc years

'without telling us. They have

created the (,‘atnbodian farnincs go-
ing on today."

Rubin also connected Nixon and
Kissinger with the current Iranian
crisis. Hc cr'ilici/cd “United States
intervention" itt Iran.

“The Shah of Iran was ptrt in
power by the CIA — We used him
to rule Iran for 37 years. The
American cmbassy in Iratt tnadc all
the decisions."

“Ayatollah Nixon and Ayillonml
Kissinger convinced Carter to let
the Shah come here." hc said.
"Carter is really saying ‘We are tur-
ly humanitarian if yotr have 15
billion dollars.‘ "

Rubin said “We owe the Iranians
an apology" atttl that the Shah
should be returned.

"We are a country founded on
bloody revolution ~ yet we are how
the world’s largest counter-
rcvolutionary power." citing US.
interference irt Iran's revoltrtion.
Rubin suggested that “we trade the
American hostages in Iran for
Ayatollah Nixon. Ahatollalr Kiss-
ingcr, atrtl Ayatollah David
Rtrckcl’cllcr, sincc they got us urto
trouble in rlrc lirst place."

 

In tr lt'lltl‘.|)t‘t?ll\'k‘ look at thc

‘60's and ‘70's, Rubin said that
“the activism of the ‘60's succeeded
because it educated the American
people." Rubin said that the ‘70's
was not a decade of apathy; that

"students were not saying ‘I don't
carc,‘ but rather 'I can’t do
anything about it.’ " Hc fttrtltcr
stated that students in the ‘70's were
made afraid to act because ol'cvcnts
such as the Kent State shootings.
Rubin added "The bullets were
aitncd at lltc consciousness ol the
rtcxt generation."

“The most important battle right
now.“ said Rubin. " is the passage
.of the ERA.“ However, it is an
atrocity that we even need the liltA
to insure equal rights." he added.

In a look into the ‘titi’s. KJIHII
cited the state ot the econottty as the
major issue of the ‘IIU‘s.

“Capitalism gave everyone a car.
but look away the gas. It gave
everyone a borne, but now you
can’t get a mortgage. We have a
strange combination of wealth and
waste."

Rubin said that "the most impor-
tant accomplishment of the ‘80's
will be the abolition of nuclear
power and nuclear weapons.

“We are reproducing cancer.
which is already an epidemic."

Rubin poitttcd out that altltortgh
“we have the technology and scien-
tific ability to rid cancer." large
corporations do IIOI channel funds
in this area. Rubin explained that
corporations cart greater profit
from defense investments. Rubin
docs not l‘orsce the ‘80's as a decade
of apathy or inaction.

“The “80's will be the best of the
‘(xl’s and ‘7()'s." he said. “We can
combine tltc power of the ‘60's with
the sensitivity arid openness of the
'70’s."

Rubin further said “'l’he purpose
