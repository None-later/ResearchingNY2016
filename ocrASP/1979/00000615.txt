unless you think that an edukashon is importent like
we do. Caws we think that almost nothing is mbre
nesesary to a pursons life than his or hers edukashon‘. O .
shor you cud be a suckseseven if you only got a litel nalig
from a schul but thats not to often. What you need if you
want to be a suckses is a kalig edukashon like from this
schul where we lerned ares,

Like for instans if you want to lern abowt tisiks or
histary or stuff like that then you can if you want to but
you got to work for it. Also you got to open your mind to
new expeerienses in life and reep what you so.‘ So even if
it dont come so easy at first what each of us has got to do
is aply hiseli or herself and then becaws it is hard and
becaws it is dificult then we lern. Beter lerning comes
from t'rying hard to lern somthing and the ‘eiort of that
teechus us somthing abowt areselis. That is not as boring
as som wud say but interesting. if you do not lern you do

maiking you have more coneckshons with the hole
univers. And when you can lern to understand things you
won't be ascared of things or hate things becaws
evrything will be known to you and youll understand it.
Evan latolers and Shas youll understand andwont hate.
See? But the thing of it is you can never know evrything
abowt anything so then you can never really know som-
thing absolutly. And thats good caws then you always got
to try to know more and lern more so its stoples. And in
schul you just get a taste of things and after that your on
your own. So dont let schul bother you to much neither
caws just between us they dont know what the hay they
talk abowt halt the time and the other half they ~t‘ry to

 

 

lern abowt. And so if you are smart youll say your stupud
and have fun trying to get smart. Thats how life works.
See how simple? °
