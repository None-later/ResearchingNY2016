Few things stay the same from one
year to the next. but at Albany State.
the past four years have seen one
situation stay completely constant.
For when the Albany State basket-
ball team ran onto a court during
that span. as certain as the Danes'
purple and white uniforms was the
player occuplng the center spot —
Barry Cavanaugh. From early In his
freshman season to his final game In

Cavanaugh owned Albany basket-
ball, and was one of the most dorrll-
nant players In Dane history.

In the third year of Cavanaugh's
reign. almost unnoticed was the ap‘
pearance of a physically Imposing
(6-6. 215) but fundamentally lackftig
player named Jones. Used ex-
clusively as a reserve. Jones' game
‘ime was scarce In his first season.
and increased some the next. Now.
after waiting patiently sometimes
and not-so-patieiitly other times.
Kelvin Jones Is the new Dane
center. and his broad shoulders will
be asked to carry a large responsibili-
ty this season.

But Jories' climb to a starting role
was not easy nor always pleasant. As
a member of the Oswego basketball

 

 

team as a freshman. Jones started
every game for the Lakers. after star»
ting for his extremely successful
Niagara Falls High School team.
After coming to Albany in 1977.
though. Jones joined an established
Dane squad. and as the new kid on
the block. he had to gain acceptance
by the players and confidence from
the coach.

“I needed to learn. and that was
the basic thing." said Jones In an In-
terview on Tuesday. “i hated It up
here. That first year i hated it. I made
the team and everything, but see
Doc (Albany basketball coach Dick
Sauersl has a system up here that
'you have to go through in stages. i
:wasn't recruited by him. so after l
was picked for the team. i got my
foot In the door. but that's It. 'Just
stay here for a while and just be
quiet.' And i just sat back and was
quiet.

“I felt like an outsider. but It was
only because of my own attitude.
wanting to play. and I knew that. I
wasn't going to get that playing time
by just being on the team. because
l'ni not that calibre of ballplayer. .l
had to work for it."
His first year. Jones' role was clear
llt' went in when Cavariuuqh

 

needed a rest. and In 22 games.
Jones' game contributions were
minimal — 2.9 points and 3.4 re-
bounds per game. But In practice,
where statistics are not kept. Jones
battled with Cavanaugh each day.
giving Jones not only the experience
he needed. but also much more.
“The biggest thing that I learned
from Barry Is desire and heart."
Jones said. “If everybody on our
team had Barry’s heart, we would

the playoffs In Kentucky last March. have went 27-0. The guy wasa team Whal 90“ EXPL’

player -— he had heart and desire.
and guts. That's what l learned.
When the chips are down, hey. go
to what you know. the stuff that's
been drilled Into you. Barry had that
attitude. and that's what I learned.
i'm a hot player at times — llel emo-
tions get Involved with my game.
and then I can't do anything. Barry
used to take me aside sometimes —~
we used to converse a lot. And he
used to teach me attitude. Barry is a
very calm person. He knows how to
hold it all in. and then all of a sudden
he explodes -— and then he does
some amazing things. That's what i
learned — attitude."
Despite his experience with
Cavaiiaugh. there was one thing that
the starting center could not teach

his backup u experience. Jones”
lack of playing time prevented him
froin acquiring what Jones feels was
art essential aspect in his develop»
nieiit ~- the chalice to prove himself
on the court.

"Doc is a person of experience."
said Jones. "He believes In It. and he
feels If you can stick around him for
two or three years. you deserve
respect. There are young players
now that are In the same situation I
was in two years ago. When Doc Is
on the bench. and he's thinking
about a situation where he needs
somebody. he's not going to look for
talent first. he's going to go to that
experience."

Last season. Jones again came In
as a reserve. and played the entire
season as the first postman to come
off the bench. His play was often er-
ratic. At times his appearance Ignited
the Danes. as his aggressive style
aided Albany's rebounding. On
other occasions Jones seemed
disoriented. and scented to lack
discipline while he was In a
liallgame. Jones attributes this to an

occasional lack of jumping ability. "I
can't jump all the time - It's a
physical thing. My body Is not equip-
ped to do it like I used to."

Although he Improved his
numbers to 3.3 points and 4.0 re-
bounds last season, Jones also mov-
ed up the confidence ladder. and his
full indoctrination to a system he
once had problems with left him as a
solid member of the Datie squad.

"The hardest part Is Just dealing
with Doc." commented Jones. “Doc
is a beautiful man. don't get me
wrong. but his coaching — It'sa thin
litre between what he expects and
ct. You have to learn

to Incorporate what you feel you can

do Into what he wants done. and if
you can't make that adjustment. you

won't play. i know you won't play. i

know.

"Just last year I was really beginn~
ing to get Into my own ~ beginning
to find out 'hey. it i do this. but I do it
the way Doc wants me to. things will
be alright.' and things started clicking
for me."

"Kelvin's whole game has improv~
ed." said Sauers. “It was natural j..u-
gress. First of all he got to play
against Barry in practice. and then
we've given him greater respoiisibilt»
ty each year he's been here."

Throughout his total basketball
career. Jones has displayed one seg-
ment of his game In which he has
always excelled. This season, that

segment will be sorely needed by the
Danes. and Jones mtrst produce as
expected for Albany to challenge for
the conference title But even as a
youngster. aided by two poles.
Jones has enjoyed this aspch of
basketball above all t'lst‘. l’or Jones.
rebounding is the name of his game.

"l love it. and 1 low to do it. When

I was a kid. l went to a boy‘s cltrh no
bigger than a small room. lllt’ court
had two poles iii tluz l'Ill(ltllL' of the
floor. You alwtiys got a shot
everytime down. lil'l‘illlSl' all yoti
ltittl to do was run yotir man into llll'
poll. And there was always congi's
lion llllfll‘flli'illll lllt' lhiSlftJl \ml 1
was always lllt'ft' getting rebounds.
and l love llltll "

Saui'rs has stated lllt' primary
concern of this year's Albany team is
consistent rebounding. Illlfl this ptits
the majority of the pressure on
Jones and his ability to control the
hackliotiiils. Joni-s not only realizes
this. lint llt' relishes the thought.

“We are not going lit llerL' the
same type of tvtun we had first your.
We are going to have .t much faster
learn it very first furl!” this year.
and that's \Vlll'lt’ l tliirtk i'm going to
contributi- the most, Just getting the
ball off the glass. giving it to Winston
or Ray or Rob. and then just getting
Irilo one of the lattes. arid their just
going. That's all I have to do. and I
know I'll get the ball back. and If l
do. just put It iii the hole. As long asl
get the ball off the glass we're going
to wtii. '

"f can score. don't get me wrong.
But that's not going to be my major
role .in the team this year. l don't
have to score. because we have peo»
ple who can score. What i basically
will try and do Is just concentrate on
gettlrig the ball off the glass. Now
that entails offensive rebounds. and
that's where l'll get my points."

One element of Jones' game that
was not always as stable as his re-
bounding was hls emotions. At
times. his court demeanor has con-
sisted of berating referees. and when
this occurs. Jones' performance Iti-
variably suffers. 3

"Sometimes Kelvin lets his enio»
tlons get the best of him." said
§auers. “l'le realizes it and so do i.
bornettmes It helps ltlm play better
and sometimes It doesn't. When ll
doesn‘t. It's my job to take lilrti otit."

"it was a problem In the past. but

KelVin ones: Content In His Role

Jones. "Doc used to tell me ‘hey.
there's no use for you to go out there
and do those crazy things. because
it's not going to help anybody.' And I
learned how to just shut up. A lot of
times this year you're going to notice
me saying sssh. sssh. and i won't be
saying that to anybody but myself.
I'm telling myself to be quiet ~ just
don't say anything."

Feeling confident about this year's
Dane squad. Jones looks back at last
year's disappointing finale. a one
poirit overtime loss in the NCAA
playoffs. and he wants another
chance this season. "i want to go
back to the playoffs. That was a great
time in Kentucky. You're down with
some of the nicest teams in the
country. you eat good. and you get
to meet people. The overtime loss
last year. that hurt real bad. l said to
myself after that ‘we're coming back.
ill have anything to do with it. we're
coming back.‘ "

And what does Jones wartt to
leave behind. in this his last season
as a Dane?

"l just want to go otit nice. I came

make sure somebody knows me 0.

Winston Royal recalls the incident
all too well:

"I remember when I came back
one year after playing overseas for
the summer and we were practic-
ing." the Albany State guard was
saying."There was a violation and l
grabbed the ball and threw it in
bounds and everyone out there just
j looked at me like i was crazy. I then
realized l was playing back here."

According to Royal. though. his
participation in such events as the
World Games last October in the
Philippines. and this summer in
Puerto Rico for the Pan American
- Gaines. makes the advantages of
competing abroad outweigh the
‘Sornetlmes humiliating couse»

Now that Royal's one~year layoff

it's back to work for the 5-9

Sauers wasn't surprised by the
selection of Royal. either. "i would

anything else." Sauurs said. "I would

assume it was pretty much

Another clear-cut decision was

when Royal chose to leave the
Danes last fall for the prestigious
World Games. “I had never par-
ticipated In them before. arid it orin
occurs once every four yearsJ
wanted to go to Manila. 1 had never

Before he left for the World
Games. Royal was forewarned by
Sauers that when he came back. his

 

j role would be of a spectator and not

cltiding Royal. the Danes may
employ a revolving-door substitution
system. and this will strengthen the
full-court defensive press that Sauers
hopes to use. Also In the works Is a
fast-breaking offense. but an essen»
tial Irigredlent for a running team —
defensive rebounding ~‘ was not
present at Bentley.

"A guard cat't't t‘Illl until somebody

Stiiiers. “i think in three halves of

There's always next year. and l'd
rather play a full year than a half year
anyway."Royal's next competitive
endeavor took him to Puerto Rico
and the Pan American Games over

and the Virgin Islands were among
his team's opponents. "We weren't
really ready. but we did pretty well."
indicated Royal. Playing overseas
during the summer months Is an an-
nual tradition for Royal. who
regularly competes in a tournament
and also iii other games with his
native squad. '

Aside frotii some rule differences
between basketball in America and
abroad. Royal has noticed sortie
variations iii the styles of' play bet-
ween the two. “There's ti lot more
contact there." he said. “The offeri-
sive player has a great advantage
over the defensive player because he
cart use his body and push off and
do what he wants to do "

Without Cuvanatigli and Verdcjo
to count oti. Royal hopes to pick tip
the slack. and he's ready for the

   
   

t’lirtllt‘tiUl' "l see myself thinking
lllttlt‘ offensively because there's no

pretty well so far. They're going to
get the ball inside. but when i play
now. I don't concentrate as much on
feeding the post as I used to. It's
more like trying to hit the open
shot."

As the main cog iii the Danes
guard-oriented offense. Royal. who
was aii All City Honorable Mention
selection out of Brooklyn's Samuel
J. Tilden High School. expects the
Danes to showcase an exciting brand
of basketball to the University Gym
fans. "We‘re going to be doing a lot

we're gonna l‘lii‘.

"Potentially. we have a better

are ahead of last year. definitely.

came here as a walk-on after being

there's no break. we're going to set

in Manila. one of the Dominican
Republic's opponents was China,
and Royal reﬂected on a memorable
break he used to run against them.
"They had this player. . . he was 7
feet 6 inches tall. and he was real
wide." recalls Royal. "and whenever
we got the ball on a fast break. l'd
just get the ball and dribble right by
film and use him as a screen."

“Winston looks better than when
he did when he left." Sauer525ald.
“He'll be the floor leader out there. l
just don't want hint to bring up the
ball all the time. in times of crisis.
he'll do it.

He's a little stronger and has a little
greater range on his shooting. He's
as quick and as last and as smart as
he always was. You don't get many
walk ons with that type of talent."

For someone who has developed
it reputation as being the silent player
who gets the job done. the latter

quality has proved true. but Royal

has modified the first characteristic.
"l've always been a gut guy. but
up here 7 this place tends to change
you, When I first came up here. l
was real quiet and a shy individual.
but people just don't understand you
when you're quiet and shy. so you
have to be outgoing. Sometimes you
have to change your ways and that's
witat happened to me. l think it's
helped me though, because you
can't go on throughout life just being
quiet and shy and introverted."
This doesn't mean that Royal is
the emotional-type player. either. “I
don't know if i get psyched with a big
home crowd. ljust keep one thing in
mind. I just want to go out there and

 

play and do the best job i can."

although I don't know how It is going
to be distributed. l don't see any
dominant scorerput there. and i
doubt that we'll have a 15 point
scorer this year."

So that's what the Danes season
will be. Without one dominant
player. Albany will have to blend all
of their talents. carefully fitting
together each player's strengths. and
attempt to cancel out the
weaknesses. And if that should liap‘
pen. each member of the Danes will
share In the success. but the real
winner will be the team.
