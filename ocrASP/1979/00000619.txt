The pressure today In inter-
collegiate athletics ls great. even in
small Division ill schools. Therefore,
when veteran coaches feel threaten-
ed about changes in their status quo.
they tend to push back. That has
been the case in recent weeks as
basketball coaches of the State
University of New York Athletic
Conference (SUNYAC) have had
strong reactions to the league‘s new
divisional format and playoff system.

Those whose hands (and heart)
the fate of the conference rest in
decreed last spring to change its

structure. Now instead of one
cumbersome 12 team unit. the
schools have been split

geographically into six team divi-
sions called — you guessed It —— East

and West.
The East Division consists of
Albany. Binghamton. Cortland.

Oneonta. Plattsburgh and Potsdam,
while the West includes University
of Buffalo. Buffalo State, Brockport.
Geneseo. Fredonla and Oswego.

Under the new system each team

will play a liome-andvhnme series
against the five opponents iti its divi-
sion. The top two teatns in each
qualify' for the SUNYAC playoff
tournament.
This arrangement has beeti met
with mixed emotions from some of
the more outspoken mentors in the
league. Some agree with the divi-
siotial set tip while others are looking
forward go the expanded playoff
system. but few are happy with both
infringements on their status quo.

“it stinks." growled Piattsburgh

Coach Norm Law when asked about
the new home-and-home schedul-
ing. “1 would like‘to see it become a
double round robin ——'that is the on.
Iy way to have a true conference
champion."
“The east~west is bad. i was totally
against it. and l'm still totally against
it. l think it's absurd," said Albany
coach Dick Sauers. “You could
finish third in the east. win 20
games. and not go to the NCAA's. A
.500 team. because they're playing
on their home court or something.
could get to the NCAA'S.

Not all opinions have been as
negative. Binghamton‘s John Af~
ﬂeck is looking forward to the new
plans: “it's a good idea. it will create
more interest and excitement. More
teams will now have a chance to
make the playoffs.

“Let's give it a try." stated Cor-
tland coach Alan Stockholm. “The
east is surely the toughest division.
which is a drawback,"

Some coaches felt that more
changes are Imminent next year after
the flaws in the present format are
more defined. Hopefully those flaws
won't become embarrassing come
tournament time.

Last season was one of the most
CAClilf‘lQ ever in the conference as
three schools — Albany, Potsdam
and Plattsburgh — all finished with
9-2 records to tie for the title,

Potsdam and Albany then ad-
vanced to the NCAA tournament.

SUNYAC East Division:
Potsdam (Bears) 1979 record
24-7 Head Coach — Jerry Welsh

second in NCAA Division ill.

Center —— Derrick Rowland (6-4 Jr.)
Led the Bears to the NCAA finals
last season. He averaged over 21
points a game and was named to the
all tournament team at the NCAA
final four. Rowland is quick with ter-
rific moves to the basket. along with
belrig a good leaper. By far the most
talented pivot man in the conference
he could lead the Bears to another
SUNYAC title, at least.

Forwards ~-— Here the loss of
unheralded Fran Demyan could hurt
Potsdam more than most observers
think. Welsh regarded him as the
league's best defensive player anti
was also a clutch shooter. Returning

Einstnan and 6-4 Wayne Grimet
figure to be the starters. Baldwin (17
ppg) is an excellent offensive player
whom the Cardinals look to in
crucial situations. Einsrnan and
Grimet are solid players but their
lack of height points to the team's
weakness off the boards. Law is hop-
ing that 0-6 freshman Scott Wilfore
will develop quickly enough to be
helpful during second half of the
season. '

Guards w Returning starter Joe
l’urcelll ((3-3) leads a thin hackcouit
group for Plattsbuigli. Letterri'iati
Dan Tlieiss (6»0ppg) will start. Frosh
Pete Gurney is the best Law can do
off his "questionable" bench. Depth
and lack of scoring punch could hurt
Cardinals playoff hopes.

Comment — Lack of dominant big
man up front along with absence of
explosive scorer in the backcourt
could make it a long season for Car-
dlrial supporters. However Law led
an unspectacular team to a share of
the conference title last season. so
anything can happen.

OneontafRed Dragons) — 197‘)
Record 16-8 — Head Coach-Don
Fleweling

Center — Depth is the key word
here as Fleweling has three men vy-
itig for the starting nod. Anderson
Mitchell. a ti~4 sophomore. has the
inside track right now. Behind him
are Rick Dexhermer(6»4) and Tim
Rice(t)~4). This should be a strong
rebounding spot for the Dragons but
shooting is a question mark.

with him will be 6-3junlor Don Cribb
and another freshman. Pete Har-
ding, inexperience is Oneonta's
maiti concern at the corner spots.

Guard ~ Running Fleweling's of-
fense frorti the point guard spot will
be sophomore Derrick Black. Black
is a good ballhandler and penetrates
well to the basket. Dragons will look
for him to key their offense. His
backcourt mate will be eltlier Buddy
Baltker or letterman Jerome Smith.

Comment —— Flewellrig has an ex-
tremely young squad with mostly
first and second year players
scheduled to start. Combine that
with having to play 11 of first 12
games on the road and the results
could be disasterotis. The talent is
there. however. so the Dragons
could begin to peak later in the
season. Look for them to finish
strong, but just miss the playoffs.

Cortland (Red Dragons) — 9-15
— Head Coach-Alan Stockholm —
12th Season.

Center — The Red Dragons will
leave plenty of opponents weary
after sending their pivot duo of Gary
Mattraw((J-8. 240) and 6-6 Larry
"Skip" Avery out to throw their
weight around under the boards.
The depth and experience 'hese two
provide should give Cortland one of
the most physical frontvcourts in the
division.

Forwards — Junior co-captain Jim
Meyerdiecks and 6-4 Jim Polan both
returning starters will provide a well
balanced compliment to the big man
iii the middle. Coach Stockholm
regards Polan as the team's premiere
defender while Meyerdiecks compil-
ed a 14 point scoring average and
garnered nine rebounds a game last
season. Depth will be a problem at
forward.

Guard — Fine point guard Nick
Wharton(5-8) leads a relatively
unknown contingent of backcourt
men for the Red Dragons. Wharton
is a returning Starter and co-captain
who averaged 12 points last season
and led the club with 88 assists.
Along with him will probably be
transfer ’l‘om Baez from American
International College or Freshman
Gerry Power.

Continent —— Three returning
starters and strength at the center
spot shows that Cortland will sur-
prise many teams this season. Depth
at forward and in backcourt are the
squad's weak points, With any luck
on the road the Red Dragons could
finish as high as third.

Binghamton (Colonials) — 1979
record —— 7-17 ﬂ Head Coach-
John Affleck

Center — Rick Wunder(6~5) and
Carl Wiggins(6-6) will share the
pivot for the Colonials, Neither has
dominating talent so Affleck intends
to get as much mileage as possible by
splitting the playing time. Lack of
consistent scoring and rebounding
from this position will probably keep
Binghamton near the cellar.

Forwards — Affleck has indicated
that 6-4 Mark Aburscato and 6-4
Bernie Zimmer along with'Greg Tet-
ter will garner most of the playing
time here. Better than average
height and good quickness could
make this a strong point for the Col-
onials. Offensive abilities are ques-
tionable although the front line
defense should be strong.

Guards — Returning starter Charles
i'leins(12.() ppg) leads a young
group that could see three freshmen
sharing the guard spot opposite
Heins. Joel Jaechim. David
McGargle and Kevin Zeistg. all
freshmen. are highly regarded by At»
fleck and seem to point to a bright
future for Binghamton. However.
the SUNYAC is loaded with ex-
cellent guards so the learning pro»
cess could be a tough one. if the.
rookies rack up more turnovers than
assists Affleck will look to letterman
Marty Pianzolaffw- 1).

Comment »— Coming off it 7»17
record without one returning senior
along with the stiff divisional com-
petition gives John Affleck every
right to cry "wait till next year".
However he feels that with some ad-
ded home games and his promising
tintlt-rclassinen the Colonials “won't
fall over to anyone " Maybe not
anyone John. but probably almost
eiiuryoire.

education than i have." said Scott. who is
presently an English major. Although he at-
tributes part of the blame to himself. he also
feels that the individual departments have a
"tunnel-vision into their requirements which
makes it hard to get a well-rounded education.
i've changed my major many times and We
found people to be department-o-centric,"

Although there is a general consensus

towards taking a variety of courses in different
disciplines among students. there was some
disagreement as to whether this attitude
should be made an official policy in the form
of distributive requirements (requiring students
to take a specific number of credits within
specified departments).

Duane was against the
distribution requirements. "l'm the type of per-
son who will take a wide variety of courses. it's
hard for someone to take five courses each
semester and not have a sampling. it's not
necessary for the university to start imposing
restrictions."

Ron agreed with the idea of students haying
the freedom to decide for themselves "i think
people should be able to ldltt' what they want
to take." he said

Jerry had mixed feelings about the issue.
He felt that ideally the requirements were a
good idea but that practically speaking. they
wouldn't work. "if you make someone take
what they don't want to take. problems such
as cheating might ensue." he said,

Tom. an English major with a concentration
in journalism. advocates distribution re
quirements with the stipulation that each
discipline develop curriculiims which the non
malor would find interesting. “it should be
developed much like the way the New York
Titties has set up its Science Times Section."
he said. “The articles deal with scientific sub~
jecls but they are written so that the general
public cati understand and learn from them."

Some students feel that distribution re
quirements would help fill the gaps that exist in
a high school education. “Kids have been told

imposition of

 

to express themselves but they don't know
how — they haven't gotten the basics." said
Anne. an English Education major. "Having
student taught and seen the poor quality of
writing and general knowledge of high school
kids 1 think a more traditional approach is
needed."

“Not everyone comes to college as Joe
Mature." said Gina. a SUNYA alumnus and
currently a French TA on campus. She felt
that she'd spent a great deal of time in sear~
ching for a major and trying many different
areas without specific guidance.

Howie. in contrast. advocated distribution
requirements because he felt pressured to
declare a major early on in his college career
instead of exploring various possibilities. He
felt that tttdjtil requirements limit the courses
an individual can take and that the tendency in
choosing electives is for taking the easy way
out. “i find it ironic that there are students
coming out of here wttli impressive cunts but
lacking ltt ability to speak English correctly and
oblivious to the goings on in the world "

Scott also felt the disproportionate emphasis
int grades ralliei titan learning for its own
ttJthttlS. "Many students have the attitude of ‘1
don't need to ltiiow it (for the test) so why
should l'," he said. "The goal. rather than
knowledge is llit' test and i think that's wrong."

All students interviewed. regardless of
academic experiences. felt they had matured
at SUNYA. They attributed this new-found
maturity. however. more to the fact that they
