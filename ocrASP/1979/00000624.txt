Dear Big Dom,

We would like to thank you very much for
your generosity in providing subs to satisfy
our craving for the best subs anywhere. When
we were students at Albany State, Walt's Subs
were the traditional Sunday night dinner and’
midnight snack. In the last few years the ,~
name may have changed, but the taste is still
the same - definitely worth an 800 mile round
trip. As far as we're concerned; the/words
on the Big Dom's bag shouldn't be "Inside is
the best submarine sandwich in town," but

   
      
         
               
    

"Inside is the best submarine sandwich in the
world." And we should know - we traveled all
' the way from Washington, D.C.‘just to pick

some up for lunch.

    
     
   
   
 

Thanks once again!

Sincerely,

  
     

Jessica Z. and Robert Harris

You DON'T HAVE To TRAVEL 800 MILES FOR A

   

BIG DoM’s SUB; BUT IT IS WORTH THE TRIP!
