The Albany State men's .l.V.
basketball team won their inaugural
game of the i979-80 season with an
8l-75 decision over the Junior Col-
lege of Albany Wednesday night at
University Gym. The victory is the
first for new head coach Steve
Kopp. Mike Gatto and Mike Gaines
were tied for scoring honors with 20
points apiece tor the Danes.

“We didn't know much about
them." said Kopp. “if we were
ready. we thought we‘d give them a
good game." About the only thing
Kopp did know about the Sabres
before the contest that they were
big. with two men at 6-5 and one at

Kopp was pleased. but showed
concern about a few aspects of the
game. “For otrr ﬁrst game. it was a
pretty good job. but we had quite a
few cheap fouls.” Indeed. fouls
could irave been a major factor had
there been a smaller difference het-
wcerr the two learns. Four of
Albany's top six players fouled otlt.
with cartairr Rick Cornell leading
the way. .s be was benched with
|l:0| remaining in tire contest. Join-
ing ltirrr were Dave Hardy. Glen
Phillips. and Ray Edwards. Kopp
attributed this problenr to possibly

,pf~.—a

 

   

being a result of Albany’s size
disadvantage.

At any rate. after taking the lead
early in the first half. the Danes
never fell behind, with the score at
38—31 in Albany's favor at the half.
The difference was as large as is
(78-63) with [:57 to go. but JCA cut
the margin in half as Kopp inserted
the reserves. “What we did in the
first half worked...we went with
pretty much what we planned to,"
said Kopp. "it was a fairly balanced
effort. lfeverybody can make some
kind of contribution. that‘s all we
need."

Kopp was especially pleased with
the fact that ten of the ll players
scored, with four in double figures.
Hardy (ll points) and Phillips ([0
points) being the other two. Kopp
continued. "It‘s good to spread it
(the scoring) around."

Wirlr regards to the coriring
season. Kopp figures an asset to be
the addition of former Albany State
player Carmelo Verdejo as assistant
coach. Of his triirrrber two iirati.
Kopp says. "He knows the system
and the opponents."

Playing what ire calls a “fairly
good schedule" which includes Col-
gate. West Point and Dartmouth.
Kopp feels that health is a key to
this years ballelub.

ens With 81-75 Victory

Not possessing an abundance of
depth, any serious injuries to the
top seven or eight men, or even any
recurrence of last night's fouling
epidemic. could prove detrimental
to the season.

Kopp is very careful in compar-
ing this year’s .l.V. Danes to their
competition. When questioned on
the quality of his squad, Kopp
stated. “1 don’t know yet. i haven’t
seen enough teams play." He sees
many of his team’s skills as
"average" including team speed
and shooting ability. “We only
have a couple of real good shooters.

“Our skills are fairly good," he
continued. “Everybody's got
something which can help us.
Nobody’s a superstar."

Tomorrow. against Siena (at
Urrrversity Gym). Kopp feels that
the two biggest things the Danes
must work to prevent are forcing
the offense and fouls. "We forced

the fast break when it wasn‘t there

sometimes...Tlrcrc are quite a few
‘nrore than nrinor' things we have
to work on."

With no .l.V. post-season
playoffs to shoot for. Kopp puts tl c
team‘s goals rather sinrply. “As a
team. we're just going to try and
wrn as rrrarry garrres as we can."

‘ More Talent Than Ever’ For Gymnast Team.

process we should do real well."
said Spillane.

Spillane mentioned a type of
"incentive" program which she in-
stituted to maintain high motiva-
tion and interest. The program is
similarly based on the varsity foot-
ball tcam's handout's of "paws"
for excellence on their helmets. The
girls receive "stars" on their shirts
as they attain outstanding recogni-
tion in meets.

The team new practices twice a
day-once in the morning and again
in the afternoon. Chemotti feels
that the double-workout “has had a
good turnout from the girls. We
really need these two workouts per
day to get ready for the meets."

Very important to the team is a
leader, and that‘s what Chemotti is.
As an unselfish captain in her ﬁrst
year as Dane leader. she feels her
job is to “motivate and prislr the
girls. i try to encourage the girls-
pointirrg out good and bad points.
Our team is really one bit unit. lrelpv
ing eacir other out."

Tire schedule this year shows a
great deal of solid competition with
lthaca, Vermont, Northeastern.
and Hol‘stra leading the tough
teams the Danes will face in the
course of the season. Chemotti feels
that “itiraea will be tough to beat
but everyone else will be real close
with roughly the satire potential as
is."

Assistant gymnastics coach
David Licbliclr feels that “we have V
a lot of potential. full of freshmen-
wlriclr means a lot of development
in years to corrre. There are many
young kids and experience in rircets
is the best way to get acquainted
with college gymnastics."

This year the state has divided
college gymnastics into three divi-
sions. with Albany State in Division
ill along with Brooklyn College.
Hunter College. Kings College.
New Paltz, West Point Academy
and Queens College.

Chenrotti feels that "compared
to last year we have more dedica-
tion and loyalty and that's impor-
tant for a good team."
