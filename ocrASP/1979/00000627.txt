The Ad Hoc U.S. Hands Off lran
Committee planned to picket out-
side the Chase Manhattan Bank on
State Street Saturday. bur was forc-
ed to postpone the demonstration
until police protection would be
provided.

The committee was going to pro-

main holder of the Shah's money -—
billions of dollars stolen from the
people of iron," stated a committee
flier.

Albany Mayor Erastus Corning

been receiving telephone threats
regarding the protest.

“When we spoke to Corning con-
cerning this matter, be accused us
of trying to instigate a riot." Taber
said. "McArdlc refused to commit
police because this would be a sign
