Yale University has encountered '

problems with its program called

Experimental College flan

“Yale Tech". According to
Associate Dean Charles Long,
ﬁnancial difficulties hindered the
,prograrns second semester.

“it was very successful the first
semester it ran," he said. “This
year. too much money was spent on
publicity and the program had to be
cut back. However. the idea is not

officials said. They said winds of up
to 30 mph had pushed her tumbling
body toward the building.

Security officer Frank Clarke
rescued Miss Adams from the nu-
row shelf after hearing her cries.

“Yale Tech" is run by two
students under the supervision of
Associated Student Agencies. Ac-
cording to the program's co-
director Tim Gollin, “The program
moved too quickly."

“We were a little too ambitious
and the program got a little too
elaborate," he said. “We pay the
teachers $l0 an hour; if enrollment
is low. profit is low. We made 51200
the ﬁrst semester the program ran.
and lost $800 the next semester,"
said Gollin. .

Fees for the credit-free courses
run approximately $30 for each,

“Yale is stuffy — perhaps rightly
so," said Gollin. "It feels it has an
academic role to fulfill and it won't
give credit for non-academic
courses."

“Yale Tech" co-director John
Lippman said. “We are working on

semester.

“We started out being optimistic
about the creation of a new type of
education. but it just hasn't hit that
level." he added.

Cornell University’s
"Experimental College" program
has “gradually and steadily" grown
since its start in 1972, according to

.Cornell Program Assistant of

University Unions Laurie Nash.
“The program has been made

charge a fee for the classes, but
basically to cover the cost of the in-
istructors. Any surplus money goes
back into the expansion of the pro-
gram."

The program sponsors 35-40
classes and involves 830 students
per semester. The only problem,
said Nash. is a shortage of facilities.

“The student participation is in-
creasing so much. and they want
more classes." she added. '

Rally Supports New Law

scrutiny.

The testing corporations also

However, Haber explained. a
forthcoming report, drafted by
Ralph Nader. on educational
testing services. will reveal that five
percent of u student‘s fee paid to
IiTS. goes toward test development
while 22 to 27 per .‘ent is prol‘il.

According to Ross. the 22 to 27
percent profit “translates into 590
million which is used for high
salaries. corrt'ercnc- ‘i irt Acapulco
and the Caribbean."

College lioard Executive Director
of Public Affairs Carol Halstad say
this is “just not true.” She explain-
ed that they are a non-profit
organization and "the cost of
developing a test is pretty high. We
have to charge more to cover the
cost of developing new questions.”

Halstad cited lack of time as
another reason for opposition to
the law. “it’s impossible under the
law to offer tests at the same level if
we have to develop new questions
all the time." she said.

In addition. she said “it takes 18
to 24 months to produce one form
of the test."

Ten other state laws and a federal
testing law similar to New York
State's have been proposed. ETS
‘will have to take its f0cus off New
'York." said Haber. ‘

Malkin feels that state sens...
Ken Lavalie. who originally in-
troduced the bill. and the legislature
“will hold firm on the (N.Y.) bill."

“These students are captive con-
sumers." Ross said. “Either they
take the exams or they don't con-
tinue their education. This law will
help balance that power."
