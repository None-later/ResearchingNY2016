Flags Are Hot

A Philadelphia flag store reports
that — in the wake of the crisis in
lran — there's been a minor rtin on
flags . . . both Americait and Ira-
ntan.

Brian O'Connor ol' Humphrey's
liags says that his store has been
deluged with buyers — most of
tltettt either college students or
retired people — who want to fly
Old Glory as an act of patriotism.

However. Iranian ﬂags are also
said to be "hot items." O‘Connor
reports that he has sold many ira-

 than

one to a customer who also asked
for instructions on how to set the
flag aﬁre. A good lranian flag,
O’Connor says, goes for about $30.

Stoned Dog

A police board ofinquiry looking
into a biting incident by a police
dog. has been told that the dog may
have been hiin on drugs when he at-
tacked his handlcr recently.

Authorities at the Huttonsville
Correctional Center in West
Virginia report that the dog, Gus,
had gotten into drugs that his
handler kept in liisjacket pocket for

, fdrugs. the prison officials
say, may have caused poor Gus to.
hallucinate and then attack his
trainer.

Feminine Gratilto

Females have reportedly replaced
males as the sex most likely to scrib-
ble their thoughts on bathroom
walls. .

Two former University of
Massachusetts researchers. John
Bates and Michael Martin. report
that they equipped a team of stu-
dent volunteers with index cards
and sent them on a survey of the
walls of campus restrootns. gym-
nasiums and other buildings.

Their toilet tally revealed the
unexpected conclusion that women

 

ten commentaries on the grafﬁti of
others.

_ Bates and Martin say this in-
dicates quite a switch in roles.
Twenty—six years ago, sex researcher
Alfred Kinsey found that women
accounted for only a quarter of all
bathroom graffiti.

Plato 0n Hiccups

The Health Insurance institute
trade associationays that the fourth
century B.C. philosopher Plato was
right when he prescribed sneezing as
a cure for hiccups.

Plato said that if holding your
breath and gargling with water fails
to get rid of the annoying hieups.
you should tickle your nose. and

THE LIVING SPIRIT LIVES ON

The New School’s Graduate Faculty of Political
and Social Science began in the early 1930's as The
University in Exile, a haven for European scholars
driven from their homelands by tyranny and
persecution. In 1937, Thomas Mann suggested that
this faculty of exiles adopt as its motto "To the
Living Spirit," which was the inscription
on a plaque removed by the Nazis
from the Great Hall at the Univer-
sity of Heidelberg. -
