WHAT '5 RAPE?

According to Webster. rape is the V
“illicit carnal knowledge of a
woman without her consent. ef-
fected by force. duress. intimida-
tion or deception as to the nature of
the act." Rape is a crime against
women. Rape is a deadly insult
against you as a person. Rape is the
deprivation of sexual self-
determination. Rape is a man's fan-
tasy. a woman's nightmare. Rape is
all the hatred. contempt. and op-
pression of women in this society
concentrated in one act.

Rape is not a special. isolated act.
It is not an aberration. a deviation
from the norms of sexual and social
behavior in this country. Rape is

simply at the end of the continuum

of male-aggressive. female-passive
patterns. and an arbitrary line has
been drawn to mark it off from the
rest of such relationships. That line
is superficially imposed accounts
fo: the tremendous confusion that

arises when we try to talk abo

rape. It accounts for the difﬁcult
that the laws and the courts have in
prosecuting a rapist. It accounts for
the fact that the average person will
condemn rape as a crime equivalent

to murder. but will have little sym-
pathy for the actual victim ofa rape
and. as juror. will acquit the rapist
nine times out of ten. We muddle
around trying to draw artificial lines
in the actual behavior of real per—
sons. and we ﬁnd that it cannot be
done. if it happens in an alley. it's
rape; if it happens in bed. it‘s love.
If the man is a stranger. it's rape; if
he's your date, it’s love. If he hits
you full in the face. it's rape; if he
merely overpowers you. it's love.

We refuse to be victims any longer;

the time for action is NOW.

Rape is any sexual intimacy forc-
ed ort one person by another. Rape
differs frottt acceptable sexual rela-
tiotts in one. attd only one. concrett
way. One person is unwilling and is
therefore forced. It would be possi-
ble. ttndcr our definition. for a
woman to rape a man. We are not
going to deal specifically with that
possibility simply because we feel
that it is so rare in comparison to
the reverse situation that to deal
with it at all would be to over-
emphasize its itnportance. There are
reasons that it is rare and they
should become clear as we go along.

SOME FACTS
ABOUT RAPE

NEW YORK WOMEN AGAINST
RAPE

.

Rape is the fastest rising violent
crime in America. The latest report
by the FBI is that one women is
raped every 7 ntinutes. BetWeen
I960 and I97I the FBI reported
there was a I46 percent increase in
the number of reported rapes. In
I972 there was a 35 percent increase
over l97I.

Rape is the most unreported
crime itt America. The FBI has
estimated in I97l that only one
woman out of to reported her rape
to the police.

Among the ten largest cities in the
US. New York ranks 9th in the
number of reported rapes. In I973
police received 3,735 rape com-
plaints. In I977. 5.000.

The New York City arrest rate is
about I out of every 3 reported
rapists. The conviction rate is about
3 out of 100 reported rapists. The
national average is I out of 60.

Almost half of those arrested for
rape in NYC get their charges
reduced to misdemeanors.

Of cases that reach the New York
Grand Jury. about 4 times as many
rape cases are dismissed as the
average of all violent crimes.

RAPE

The woman was eighteen years
old. a College freslmtan. and a
virgin. She had been rather strictly
brought up. hill she was strong-
willed and was testing her freedom.
That night she went to a fraternity
party with a young man she had
dated a few times before. He told
her it would be a long party. lasting
beyond the dormitory closing
hours, and so he had arranged for
her to spend the night with the girl
friend of one of his fraternity
brothers. After some hesitation. site
signed out overnight. It was the first
time she had ever done tltat. and it
scented exciting.

The party did ettd very late.
When it was over. ltcr date inform-
cd her that his fraternity brother
was going to spend the night with
his girl friend. so she couldn't go
there. The dormitory had already
been closed for hours.

He offered to rent ltcr a roottt in a
motel. Knowing that he would meet
with some resistance. he talked to
her for a long titttc. reassuring her
that it would be all rigltt uttd that he
had no intention of coming irt with
her. Site couldn‘t go back to the
dormitory willtottt waking ltcr
dorm mother and risking getting
campused. Her date really managed
to make it scent that she would be
making a fuss over nothing if she
did not accept his offer. Of course
he played on her fears of scemingly

unsophisticated and naive. And so.
rtot kttowing ltow to say that she
didn't trust Itirtt witltout offending
him. she said that she would do it.
It was really too bad. slte thought.
that she couldn't rertt the roorn
herself attd just leave him in the
parking lot. But she never had
ntttclt rttortcy and she certainly
didn't carry the price of a motel
rootn itt Itcr purse when she was go-
ittg lo a party. Besides. she didn’t
evert know how yott wettt about
renting motel rooms. or whether
they would rcttt one to an eighteen—
year-old girl.

AND SOCIAL PATTE

When they got to the motel. lte
walked her to her roont. She was a
little afraid of the strange motel. so
that was all right with her. But
when they got to the room, he
didn‘t leave: he walked in attd clos-
ed the door behind him. She asked
him to leave. of course. He said that
he just wanted to sit down for a
ntinute before he drove back to the
fraternity house. He had paid for
tltc room. after all. and it wasn't
very generous of her to ask him to
get ottt when all he wanted to do
was sit down for a ntinute.

HE HAD PAID
FOR THE ROOM

They talked for a little while. He
was very natural. casual. attd relax-
ed. He didn't try to do anything.
bttt she was still uneasy. Finally ltc
got up to leave. He came over to
kiss ltcr good night. Well. site
tltougltt. she had kissed ltittt before
wltctt they ltad gone ottt. So she
kissed ltitn. tryittg to be firm but
fricrtdly. That was when he pushed
her onto the bed. pulled up her
skirt. pittrtcd her down. attd raped
her.

Site fought. In fact. she fought
very hard. hilt she was already on
her back and it didn't do much
good. He was quite a bit bigger and
stronger than she was. At that point
she really didn‘t have a chance.

It ltttrt a lot. He told ltcr to stop
moving. She said she couldn't. she
had givcrt up the idea of fighting
ltittt off. At no time did he scent to
be overcome by desire. He didn't
say anything nice to her. but he
didn't say anything bad either. Only
that she should stop moving. He
was annoyed that she wouldn't lie
stil .

At arty time during tltc attack site

morning.

Do yott believe that the woman itt
this story wartted to be raped" The

man who raped her did. In fact. he
did not believe that he had raped
her. If you agree with him. if you
think she got what she wanted.
maybe you can suggest when she
could ltave started fighting. When
he said he would walk her to her

that would only have brought on

have solved anything. By the titnc

he had pushed Itcr onto the bed. it
was too late.

These words cotne ottt of the face

whether over twentyvfour reported
rapes attd attacks in two months is
“really a problem."

I'm really tired of having to explain
that rape is a crime of violence. attd
not a sex crime. A rapist is looking
for control. ttot sex; lie is ag-
gressive. angry attd hostile. not sex-
ually aroused; when he can‘t have
an erection (which happens in many
cases). ltc'll shove a bottle.

keep your back FIGHTING BACK

by Janice Fine

There is no one elixir. no univer-
sal panacea to remedy the problem
of rape in our culture. Some say
that woman must fight back
physically at the time of her attack.
maintaining that such action. when
increased. Would lower the frequen-
cy of assaults on women. and serve
to intimidate that potential" rapist
frorn ever acting upon his inclina-
tions. Others say that a woman, in
ntost cases. is facing a stronger.
rttore physically endowed. incensed
criminal and would be best advised
in an attack situation to submit to
ltcr attacker. That neither of these
notions are valid is clearly evident;
at the saute tittte. separately they do
not provide proper guidelines for
women.
