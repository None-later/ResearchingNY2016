Submitted by .Janice Fine in con-
junction with New York Women
Against Rape

Tlte Woman who has beert raped
has been violated in a double sense,
physically and emotionally.
Physically. rape is an act of
violence; in this sertse the victim has
similar reactions as the victim of a
mugging or assault. The initial reac-
tion is one of shock, disbelief. and
dismay. Then there is fear (for per-
sonal safety) and-or anger (at the
assailant and anyone who she
associates with the event — police.
hospital personnel, family). The
victim has experienced loss —— of
her feelings of invulnerability and
her trust in society to protect her
from harm.

Because most of society sees rape
as a sex crime. the victim has the ad-
ded burden of justifying her in-
nocence to others and herself (if she
has internalized societal attitudes).
Since the myths of rape are univer-
sally held, the victim is doubted; her
behavior is questioned. Women
have been trained to be passive and
may be psychologically unable to

defend themselves. in a rape situa-
tiort this can be turned around as a
fornt of consent. The ﬁrst reactions
seen are usually the fear or anger.
Many victims, however. give tr con— ‘
trolled appearance because they
haven‘t started to react or feel it is
importartt to look calm.

YOU ASKED FOR IT

by Connie Borkenlragen

in the following exchange. a
hold-up victim is asked questions
similar to tltose asked of a rape vie-
tint. The testimony ' indeed, the
whole litre of questioning ' would be
inadmissible. in the case of the rape
victim, it would be qtritc allowablc'
and quite startdard.

"Mr. Smitit. you were held up at
gun-point on the corner of First and
Main "

“Yts.”

“Did you struggle with the rob-
ber""

“No.”

“Why not”’

“He was armed.”

“Then you made a conscious
decision to comply with his
demands rather than rcsist' "

“Yes.”

“Did you scream” Cry out ”

“No. l was afraid."

“i see. Have you ever been held
up before“

“No.” .

“Have you ever given money

“Yes. of course . . ."

“And you did so willingly "

“What are you getting at "’

“Well. let's put it this way. Mr.
Smith. You’ve given money away in

“Never mind. What time did this

"About 11 pm.“

“Just walking."

“Just walking You know it's

history will be taken to find out the
age menstruation began. if and

gynecological infection or surgery
the victim might have bad. This in-
formation will provide the doctor
with a knowledge of how to treat
the injured person. Also, included
here will be an internal
gynecological examination. Though
this may be a difficult experience to
endure so soon after this assault, it
is necessary to see if there is any
damage to the external gertitals. the
vagina and the cervix. The woman
will be given both a bi-manual and
specuiurrt examination.

Pregnancy prevention: The risk
of becoming pregnant is rare during
a rape. Many women already use a
continuous form of birth control
(tltc pill. lUD. etc.). For women
who were using no contraception at
the time of the assault. there are
three possible actions to take:

I. Take a drug to prevent the
pregnancy. The woman must be
sure she would consider an abortion
before taking these drugs because
of the possibility of damage to the
fetus if the pregnancy
prevented. The two most common
drugs are 0vra| and
Diethylstilbestrol (or D.E.S.). With
Ovral. 2 tables are taken im-
mediately. followed by 2 more
tablets 12 hours later. With D.E.S..
25 mg. per day are taken for 5 days;
there is usually vomiting and nausea
with this method. Both drugs will
usually prevent the fertilized egg
from implanting in the uterus.

2. Have a menstrual extraction
when the menstrual period is due.

During a menstrual extraction. a
small plastic tube is inserted into the
uterus to withdraw the uterine lin-
ing. if an embryo is present. it will
be removed. in the United States.
menstrual extractions can
sometimes be obtained at women's
self-help clinics. without proof of
pregnancy. However. irt Canada.
menstrual extractions are only used
as a form of early abortion. so pro-
of of pregnancy is required.

3. Wait to see if the menstrual
period is late. if it is late, a pregnan-
cy test should be taken 6 weeks after
the first day of the last period. This
will ensure reliable results. Some of
the newer pregnancy tests will show
positive results sooner. but they will
certainly be more expensive to use.
The sooner the pregnancy is cort~
firmed, the easier any abortion will
be.

Sexually transmitted diseases-
These diseases are spread front one
person to another by some form of
sexual contact. They can be passed
through oral. anal, or vaginal inter-
course. Two forms which can he
most commonly transmitted during
an assault and which have the most
serious consequences are gonorrhea
and syphilis.

I. Gonorrhea it takes about 10
days for gonorrhea to manifest
itself. so any tests done immediately
after the assault will merely indicate
whether the woman had it at the
time of the attack. To make sure
that gonorrhea is not present. it is
necessary to have two negative test
results. These should be donestar-
ting 2 weeks after the incident at
one week intervals. Women should
be certain that they are tested in all
areas which came into sexual cott—
tact with the assailant ' vagina.
anus. motttlt. and-or throat.

2. Syphilis To test for the
presence of syphilis. a blood test
(known as a VDRl.) should be
taken 4-6 weeks after the rape inci-
dent. Since 25 percent of people
tested cart ltavc “false negative"
results. it is important that the
woman have a follow-up test 3
months later.

Some hospitals will give an-
tibiotics as a preventative treatment
for gonorrhea. There is some corr-
troversy about this practice. it is
possible that such treatment can
prcvcrtt the diagnosis of syphilis.
Some hospitals will give the art-
tibiotics automatically while other
places will only give tltcnt on re

This is an example of how to perpetuate the myths about rape. The myth that women enjoy
rape .allows the rapist to feel guilt-tree. This cartoon is not reality. Rape Is a devastating
experrence for women. Also take note that the victim in this cartoon is attractive lmplying
that this is the case. However, as our statistics demonstrate, known rape victims range from
2 months to 97 years of age.

Fear Panic Paranoia
. Anger ... Rage
Helplessness . . . Frustration
Outrage. Are these feelings familiar
to you“ They are to every woman
who is aware of her situation. Every
woman is a potential victim; no
woman is free from the knowledge
that she may some day be raped.

Why the fear, the helplessness
For centuries (perhaps since time
began). women have been raped by
men. By virtue of their physical
strength.
men have been able to overpower
women. Rape is an act of violettce.
rtot ltrst. it is physically dantagirrg
(sometimes permanently
ntutilatirtg) arid is psychologically
dcbilitatirtg. it is the ultimate
degradation. it is the only criutc in
which the victim is cortderttrrcd and
the assailant protected.

Throughout history rape has had
functional prtrpo in war titnc
rape served as a way of claiming
cncrtty property, an affirmation of
the rapists' power; irt tirrtcs of
slavery tlte slavcholdcr could ensure
a supply of slaves by raping slave
women; many women today are
forced to have sexual relations with

I. The defendant is arrested by
the police upon the corrtplaiut of
the victirtt.

2. A formal comp'airtt is drawn

constituting the fttcts'of the crime.

J. The defendant is arraigned in
Criminal Court on the complaint.

a) He is inforrttcd of the of
ficial charges of the cornplairtt as
stated irt the tti'fttdavit.

1)) Hail is set. and the case is ad»
journed for a pr'clirrtinary ltcttring.

c) If the defendant is ttlrcady irt
jail or not paroled. the preliminary
ltearing must be held within 72
hottrs.

4. Preliminary llcrtrirtg (victim
must testify). This procedure in-
volves sworn testimony subject to
cross-examinatiort which establishes
reasonable grounds to believe tlttrt a
crime has been corrtrttittcd am! that
the defendant is connected with the
commission of tire crime. Upon the

their erttployers. thus rape becomes
an economic control. Whatever
other purposes rape may have had.
it has always served as a control
over women; even the fear of the
possibility of being raped is often
sufficient to serve as a psychological
control to restrict women.

There are many myths surroun-
ding rapc. Some of our fears stem
from titesc myths. One myth is that
it is not possible to rape a non-
conscntingwoman. Since rape by
definition implies lack of consent.
this myth negates the very existence
of rape. Other myths are: women
ask for it, and probably enjoy it;
only brtd girls get raped; worttett cry
rrtpc when rape has rtot occurred.

Acceptance of these rrtytlts rcstrlr
irt feelings of guilt arttl self-blame irt
the victim. These myths also make
it ltard to convict rapists. To
straighten things out a bit it is im-
portant to dispel tltesc myths. As
long as an erect penis is capable of
penetrating a woman's vagina

tirtte and again women ltave been
accused of asking to be raped if
tltcy are attacked in any of these cir-
cumstances. The fact that a judge
cart decide that women ask to be
raped by virtue of their dress shows
me how ntucit we have to fear. as
well as showing us how little society
understands the nature of the
crime. Why is it that men can walk
around with no shirts. in pants tight
enough to see their endowments.
and not be considered to be asking
for sexual assault, yet when a
woman dresses in a certairt way she
is asking for it ‘
Society must stop blaming the
victim; the chances of being mugg-
ed irtcrcusc greatly at ttigltt. yet ifa
mart is nttrggcd he is ttot told lie was
lookirtg for it by being out at night.
It is not up In Iltt’ victim to avoid
the rapist. it is up to society to
rtrake rape unacceptable. We think
this includes changing the way we
socialize orrr cltildrcrt to conform to
sex roles how many of us believe
that Witch a woman says NO she
really means yes
The ntytlt that nice girls don't get
rapetl is easily disproved when look-
irtg or statistics. Rape victints range
irt age frortt several months to 97
years old. Surely ttll tltcse females
aren't “bad”. Virgins get raped;
grandmothers get raped. cltildrert
get raped. lesbians gct raped;
feminists get raped, the girl across
tltc hall gets raped. livery female is
vulnerable. This means no female is
free frottt the fear of rape.
l-‘car of rape is easily spread to
fear of the aftermath of rape. Fear
of how the police treat you. Fear of
being accused ofcrying wolf. (Rape
is the rttost under-reported violent
crime. Yet only 2-4 percent of rape
charges are rtrtfottrtded. the same as
for any other violent crirtte.) Fear of
ltow friends, family. and boyfriends
will treat you. Fear it may happen
again.
it is time to stop fearing rape artd
to stttrt beirtg angry about it. Rape
is always humiliating and always
painful. it is time to stop fearing
and tlrtte to start fighting. it is time
to stop accepting tape as inevitable.
Rape is a violation of ourselves as
human beings and it cannot be
tolerated arty lortgerl
