I have never been free of the fear
of rape. From a very early age I.
like most women. have thought of
rape as part of my natural environ-
ment ' something to be feared and
prayed against like ﬁre or lightning.
I never asked why men raped; I
simply thought it one of the many
mysteries of human nature.

Though rape and fear of rape are
a daily pan of every woman's con-
sciousness, the subject is so rarely
discussed by that unofficial staff of
male intellectuals (who write the
books which study seemingly every
other form of male activity) that
one begins to suspect a conspiracy
of silence. And indeed. the obscuri-
ty of rape in print exists in marked
contrast to tire frequency ofrape in
reality. f orfort'ible rape is the marl
frequently commit/ed violent crime
in America Illdﬂ)’.

Like most women. l had spent
considerable time speculating on
the true nature of the rapist. When I
was very young. my image of the
“sexual offender" was a
nightmarish amalgamation of the
bogey man and Captain Hook: lte
wore a black cape. and be tackled.
As I matured, so did the image of
the rapist. Iiorn ittto tlte
psychoanalytic age. I tried to
“understand” the rtrpist. Rape. I
came to believe. was only ortc of
many unfortunate evils produced
by sexual repression. Reasoning by
tautology. l cortcludcd tltat any
man who would rape a woman must
be out of his mind.

Yet. tltouglt lllt: titeory that

rapists are insane is it popular one.
tltis belief has no basis in fact. Ac-
cording to Professor Mcnaeltirn
Amir's study of 646 rape cttses in
Philadelphia. Puller/1.x I'Ir I’rrreib/t'
Rape. tnen who rape arc ttol abnorv
mal. Amir writes. “Studies indlettte
that sex offenders do ttot constitute
a unique or psychopathological
type; nor are they as a group in-
variably more disturbed titan the
control groups to which they are
compared." Alan Taylor. a parole
ofﬁcer who has worked with rapists
in the prison facilities at Strn Luis
Obispo. California. stated the ques-
tion in plaittcr language: “Those
men were the most normal men
there. They had a lot of hang-ups.
but they were the same hang»ups as
men walking out on the street."

Another canon in the apologetics
of rape is that, if it were not for
learned social controls. all men
would rape. Rape is held to be
natural behavior. and not to rape

must be learned. But in truth rape is
not universal to the human species.
Moreover. studies of rape irt our
culture reveal that. far front being
impulsive behavior. tnost rape is
planned. Professor Amir's study
reveals in cases of group rape (the
“gangbttng” of masculine siting) 90
percent were planned; in pair rapes.
83 percent were planned; and in
single rapes. 98 percent were plann-
ed. These ﬁgures should significant-
ly discredit the image of the rapist
its a mart who is suddenly overcome
by sexual needs society does not
allow him to fulfill.

Far from the social control of
rape being learned. comparisons
with other cultures lead one to
suspect that. lit otrr society. it is
rape itself that is learned. (The fuel
tltttt rttpe is against the law should
not be considered proof that rape is

not irt fact encouraged us part of
our culture.)

‘ e rtotiort tltrrt tripe is enjoyed

t RAPE:
THE ALL AMERICAN CRIME

by the victim is also convenient for
the man who, though he would not
commit forcible rape. enjoys the
idea of its existence. if rape con-
ﬁrms that enormous sexual potency
which he secretly knows to be his
own. It is for the pleasure of the
armchair rapist that detailed ac-
counts of violent rape exist in the
media. indeed. many men appear to
take sexual pleasure front nearly all
forms of violence. Whatever the
motivation. male sexualin and
violence in our culture seem to be
inseparable. James Bond alternate-
ly whips out his revolver and his
cock. and though there is no known
connection between the skills of
gun-fighting and love-making.
pacifism seems suspiciously ef-
feminate.

in the spectrum of male
behavior. rape. the perfect corn-
bination of sex and violence. is the
penultimate act. Erotic pleasure
cannot be separated from culture.
and in orrr culture male eroticism is
wedded to power. Not only should
.t man be taller and stronger than a
female in the perfect love-match,
but he must also demonstrate his I
superior strength itt gestures of ‘
dotttittartcc which are perceived as
amorous. Tltottglt the law attempts .
to make it clear division between
lilpc and sexual intercourse. in fact
the courts find it difficult to
distinguish between a case where
the decision to copulate was nttltutrl
attd out: wlterc a man forced hituself
upon his partttcr.

That the basic elements of rape
are involved itt all heterosexual rela-
tionships may explain wlty men so
often iderttify with the offender irt
this crime. lint to regard the rapist
as the victim. it man driven by his
inherent sexuttl needs to take what
will ttttt be given ltim. reveals a basic
ignorance of sexual politics. For irt
our culture heterosexual love finds
an erotic expression through ntttle
dominance uttd female submission.

Dear Editor:

I would like to offer a few cont-
tncuts on Molly Httskcll‘s "Rape irt
the Movies: update on an Attcicnt

. wttr" (Voice. October 8). As a rape

victim. it scents to me that most
people. male and female. even those
who are sympathetic toward the vic-
tirtt. tlo not fully understand tltc
nature of forcible rttpc.

i believe that most view this crime
as forced sex or intercourse. in the
sense that this intercourse does not
differ much itt a physiological
respect frotn that of consentttal in-
tercourse. Hence. “men scent in-
capable of understanding what rape
means to women". Forcibie rape is
riot in any normal sense intercourse.
lrt tttost cases. the lubrication of the
vagina required for normal com-
pleted Intercourse does not exist.
since petting has. more often than
not. not occurred. As tt result of
this crucial aspect. as well its the
fact tltttt the victim is usually in it
traumatized state ittttttediutcly
prccccdittg the rape tutti. tints. the
muscles at the entrance to the
vagina are not r'clttxctl. penetration
cannot either easily or immediately
occur. What does httppctt is Illtll the
rtrpist rcpctttctlly batters with his
penis the very delicate and sensitive
features lying outside the vagina,
causing the tissues to tear and to
bleed. When the force of tire

raping a woman clearly must enjoy
force and dominance as much as or
more than the simple pleasures of
the flesh. Coitus cannot be ex»
pcricnced in isolation. The weather.
the state of the nation. the level of
sugar in the blood ' all will affect a
man‘s ability to achieve orgasm. If
a man can achieve sexual pleasure
after terrorizing and humiliating the
object of his passion. and in fact
while inﬂicting pain upon her. one
must assume he derives pleasure
directly from terrorizing.
humiliating. and harming a woman.

And if the professional rapist is
to be separated front the ateragc
dontirtant heterosexual. it may
mainly be a quantitatitc difference.
For the existence of rape as an index
to masculinity is not Cillll’t‘l)
metaphorical. Though this measure
of masculinity seems to be more

As can be itttttgined. forcible rape

that it is the tttost pitysicttlly painful

One should not assume. however.
that a woman can avoid the
possibility of rape by simply behav-
ing. Though myth would have it
that mainly “bad girls" are raped.
this theory has no basis in fact.
Available statistics would lead one
to believe that a safer course is pro-
miscuity. In a study of rape done in
the District of Columbia. it was
found that 82 percent of the rape.
victims had a “good reputation.“

if white women are subjected to
unnecessary and often hostile ques-
tioning after having been raped.
third world women are often not
belimed at all. According to the
white male ethos (which is not only
sexist but racist). tltirtl world
women are defined from birth as
"impure." Thus the white male is
provided with a pool of women who
are fair game for sexual int-
perialisnt. Third world \tonten fre—

chastity of “his” women.

The feminine \\Ulll;ill is the
perfect victittt of scutttI nggresion.
If being chaste does not ward off
the possibility of assault. being
feminine certainly increases the
chance it will succeed. To be sub-
missch is to tlefcr to masculine
strength; is to lack muscular
development or any interest itt
defending oneself; is to let doors be
opened. to have one's armes held
when crossing the street. To be
fetttininc is to wear shoes which
make it difficult to run; skirts which
inltibit one‘s stride; underclothes
which inhibit the circulation. Is it
ttot art intriguing observation that
those very clothes which are
tltottght to be flattering to the
female and attractch to the male
are those which ntztke it possible for
a woman to defend herself against
aggression?

The woman is taught fear. but this

relief from this fear is to seek out
the other. Moreover. the passive
woman is taught to regard herselfas
impotent. unable to act. unable
even to perceive. in no way self-
sufficient. and ﬁnally. as the object
and not the subject of human
behavior. It is in this sense that a
woman is deprived of the status ofa
human being. She is not free to be.

Rape is an act of aggression in
which the victim is denied her self-
dctermination. it is an act of
violence which. if not actually
followed by beatings or murder.
nevertheless always carries with the
threat of death. And ﬁnally. rape is
n fornt of mass terrorism. for the
victittts of rape are chosen in-
discritttinutely. but the propagan-
tiists for male supremacy broadcast
that it is women who cause rape by
being uncltaste or in the wrong

A RACIST ISSUE

by Karen Levine

Tltttt a black ntan has been pin~
pointed as the sole pcrpctrtttor of
rape itt Albany is botlt absurd and
tragic. It is absurd irt that it is
blatantly false, and tragic in that it
fosters the pervasive racism in otrr
culture. and supports a tnytlt which
has undermined any impetus
toward unified action.

Assaults and rapes itt our cont-
rtttirtity and everywhere have been
carried ottt by ttten of all races. lrt
fttet. it has been proven that most
rapes occur within the some rncirtl
group. ltt fact. this very myth keeps
tts front identifying otrr enemy and
striking ottt at hint. Tltose who
believe that their lily white
neighborhoods and Slillilflltlll for-
tresses insulate them frottt this
hideous crime are being scttttdttlous-

percent of all rape victims kttcw
their rapist before the attttck(s) and

so. it is ttot in dark alleys by tittrk
men that we are violated. We are

If we irate the hlttck tttatt and

we can conveniently be diverted

of wltite males. For rttpe is a kittd of

Issues: media coverage of rape
Sexual assaults are traditionally
under-reported critttes because of
their perceived personal nttture and
tremendous psychological impact
on the victims. A woman. already
traumatized by the attack. may not
wish to be interviewed or
pltotographed. Victims know that
sensitive press treatments of rape
are rare. and scnsationnlizcd articles
common. Rapcs are newsworthy.
but victims require privacy.

Irt addition. ntost newspapers ap-
ply the srtme rigorous standards of
police corroboration to reports of
rope that they do to other crimes.
Police ltave been unwilling to con-
ﬁrm reports of rape because they
fear inciting a panic among local
