‘ Inmate James Scott Says

He Deserves Title Fight

‘ WOODBRIDGE. NJ. (AP) Jamesl,
Scott has beaten Eddie Gregory,
Richie Rates and most recently Ya-
qui Lopez. But the light
heavyweight from Rahway State
Prison has his toughest battles still
in front of him.

Scott's ﬁrst encounter will be
with promoter Murad Muhammad,
who holds an exclusive deal with the
New Jersey Department of Correc-
tions that allows him to promote all
bouts in Rahway. That contract
runs out in August, but Scott's peo-
ple have petitioned the state to look
into its legality.

Next, Scott’s attorney. C.
Richard Mulgran. is ﬁghting to get
the 31-year old I'ighterout of the
medium security prison to ﬁght on

the outside.

Third, the World Boxing
Association recently stripped Scott
of his No. 2 ranking. claiming they
couldn't recognize an inmate.

“They never should have rated
me if they were going to take it
away." Scott Said Saturday. after
he pounded out an easy lO-round
unanimous decision over Lopez at
the prison. Scott, naturally, would
like to be granted the right to light
outside the prison walls, where he
has a chance to get his ranking back
and get a title shot.

“I'll pay for it, I'll pay for two
guards to be with mt all the time."
he said. "That's what we're
pushing for. The press has been a
big help to me. is the press going to
let me rot here and die?"

Unless Scott is allowed to fight.
he may have reached the end of the
line in his boxing career. Even if he
can break the _contract with
Muhammad, neither the WBA nor
World Boxing Council will sanction
a title ﬁght in prison. The WBC has
never recognized Scott.

But Scott, who is serving 30-40
years for armed robbery. feels both
WBA champion Marvin Johnson
and Wle champ Matthew Sand
Muhammad can‘t lay claim to the
title until they defeat him.

“A champion can't be recogniz—
ed as a true champion until they
fight me. It‘s like when Joe Frazier
was the heavyweight champion. he
wasn't truly rccognizcd until he
beat Muhammad Ali." said Scott.
now 18.0-1. “It's the same with me.
People are going to ask Johnson
and Muhammad. what about

1 Scott? They got to fight me."
