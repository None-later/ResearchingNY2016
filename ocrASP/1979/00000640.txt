Swunm’ ' ers‘Plac‘é Fifth ‘
McGiii Invitational Meet

by Jeff Schadoff

Despite a rather “disappointing”
performance at the Dane Relays a
few weeks back. the Albany State
Swim Team traveled to Montreal
and rebounded in fine fashion.
placing an "unofficial" Sth in the
McGill University invitational
Swim meet this past Friday and
Saturday in a ﬁeld of 10.

Commenting on his team's pcr-
formancc, Coach Ron White felt
that “overall. it was a very rewar-
ding weekend: “This was the best
showing for an Albany State Swim
Team in the McGill invitational.
We never had so many people score
so high."

Kevin Ahern, whom White felt
was “the tnost outstanding per-
former for scoring so high at

McGill” placed second the 200 yard
freestyle with "an excellent early
season time.” commented Whitcﬂ
of 1151.9. Kevin also placed third in
the 50 yard freestyle in 23:24 and
also a ﬁfth place ﬁnish in the 100
yard frccstylc. clocked at 50.85.

The major contending teams at
McGiii were. beside the Danes, St.
Lawrence University, Laval College
of Montreal. home team McGill
University. and SUNYAC
powerhouse Potsdam State.
Although Coach White hadn't had
final scorirtg results at press time.
the Danes fared quite well against
the Bears of Potsdam. “We never
came so close to Potsdam."

Junior Joe Shore placed ﬁfth in h

the 400 yard individual Mcdlcy with
a personal best of 5:01.11. “l'vc

only had a few days of practicLitt; «  a

the last ﬁve weeks. i was surprised
to place so high in such good corri-
pany," said Shore.

Breaking the school record with a
ﬁne time of 2:09.41. shaving almost i

one second off the old record, was .

Steve Bonawilz in the 200 yard
Backstroke. Bonawitz. irregardicss '
of the record-breaking perfor-
mance, felt that “1 missed two

had a bad start." -

Co-captain Frank Hctcr placed in
all events he competed in. Coach
White mentioned that “Frank is
next in line (behind Ahcrn) for
acknowledgement." Hcter placed
second in the 100 yard Butterﬂy in
56.8. in the 100 yard Breaststroke
he placed third with a time of
1205.2. A fourth place finish was
awarded him for his 2:26.6 in tltc
200 yard Breaststroke.

And in individual ac-
complishments co-captain Tom
Roberts who placed sixth in the 50
yard frccstyic with a 23:59 time.

J.V. Cagers Topple Siena, 72-65

by Bob Bcllufiorc

Tltc Albany State men's .l.V.
basketball team overcame a 20-8
deficit midway through the first
half to defeat the J.V. of Division 1
Sicnzl. 72-65 Friday night at Univer-
sity Gym. It was the Danes" second
consecutive victory of [liL young
season against no losses.

“Sicna was a little better than we
thought." said Albany J.V. head
coach Steve Kopp. That scented to
be the consensus. as the Dancs' lip-
parcnt low regard for Sicna resulted
in a 31-26 halftime advantage for
thc lndians. According to Albany
guard Mike Gaines (21 points —
game high). that attitude was the I
key to tltc Dancs' poor ﬁrst half.
“We took them too lightly. That
said the

freshman.

Kopp had a somewhat different
outlook, than. .1. “We were impa-
ticnt on offense. Wc didrt't run our
fast brcuk vcry wcll in the first half.
Our biggest problem iii the first half
was offense. We weren't moving.
We just had to execute a little bct-
tcr."

But the Danes wcrcn't excelling
on defense either. as Sicnn grabbed
a 10-21cttd after four minutes. sur-
prising tltc hosts with tltcir shooting
abilities. Said Kopp. “On dcfcnsc.
we couldn‘t ﬁgurc out what they
were doittg."

Either way. it was offense that
won the game for Albany. Gaines
woke up and was responsible for 12
of Albany's ﬁrst 14 points of the se-
cortd half, against only cight for

Sicna. as the Danes took a 40-39
lead. Two successful Dave Hardy
frcc titrows gave Albany the lead at
4140, and Sicna ncvcr regained it.

‘ Tltc Indians came as close .15 52-51,
but a Mike Gatto jumper made it
54—51. The lndians couldn't get any
closer than three aftcr that. They
gairtcd some momentum near the
end. as Albany‘s delay offense was
only partially successful, but two
clutch free throws by 0.1110 (15
points) scaled the game with less
than two mirtutcs rcrrtaining.

Kopp cited Gaines and Hardy as
the keys to Albany's superior sc-
cond half. but he wasn't totally
happy. “Other than that." he said.
referring to their performances. "i
don't think we played too well."

On the other hand, assistant
conch Carmelo Vcrdejo was pleased
with the game. “i was very happy
with our second half. Thcy
(Albany) adjusted well on defense,
and that‘s what tttrncd the game
around." Fouls weren't a major
factor in this game, as they were in
last Wednesday‘s. Gaines had three
personals in the ﬁrst half. which
decreased his court time. but no one
fouled out —— a vast improvement
front the previous game, in which
fotrr men had excessive fouls. “Wc
playcd it little bit smarter defensive-

ly." said Kopp.

Along with Gaines and Gone, it
scents as if a big factor itt Albany's
succcss this season will be the per-
t‘orrnrtncc of Hardy. After coming
out late this season after football.
Hardy is providing much-needed
strength underneath (tcn rebounds
Friday — team high). He pttt
Albany’s victory irt basic terms: “i
guess we got our stuff together iii
the second half and did the job."

Titc season continues tomorrow.
as the Danes face another Division 1
lcam, Colgate. at 6:30 irt University
'L‘vym.
