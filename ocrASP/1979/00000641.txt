The Oswego Lakers entered
University Gym Saturday night not
having beaten an American basket-
ball team in two‘years, and when
they departed, that claim was safe
for yet another game. Utilizing a
fast-breaking offense and a deep
bench, the Albany State basketball
squad had little difﬁculty running
past the overmatched Lakers.
82-52.

Coming off a season in which
they could only manage two vic—
tories, Oswego's record now stands
at 1-3 this campaign, but the three
total wins during that span all came
against Canadian schools. The
Danes jumped all over their hapless
opponents. and only some sluggish
play at the outset kept the score
somewhat competitive in the ﬁrst
ttalf. ‘

“You tend to, want to have a let-
down against a teanr like Oswcgo.
but you know you can‘t." said
Dane center Kelvin Jones.
“Because if you do, they can
sometimes come otrt and beat you."

There wasn't the slightest bit of
letdown on defense by Albany. as
the Danes forced Oswego into 22
turnovers. The Lakers’ inability to
even put up shots resulted in their
dismal 20 points at halftime. and
that ﬁgure was actually inflated by
a semi-streak before intermission.
For the ﬁrst nine minutes and 15
seconds of the game. Oswego was
held scoreless. until Jody Pinrtey’s
jumper ﬁnally broke the drought by
the Lakers. Pinncy's basket was one
of only nine shots that Oswcgo was“
able to attempt before halftime, us
the Lakers went four-formine in
contrast with the Danes‘ 17 for 34
in the ﬁrst half.

“For the ﬁrst tert or 11 minutes.
our defense was outstanding.” said
Albany basketball coach Dick
Saucrs. “We did not let them do
anything they wanted to do."

“Doc told its to stay on them the
whole time." said Dane forward

Pete Stanish. “Basically, we were
trying to deny the ball to their for-
wards on the wings, and they really
didn't know how to handle our

Cortcerrted that the Lakers might
ttllcmpl to slow down the pace with
a stall of some sort. Sauers in-
structed his charges to maintain a
fast terttpo. attd although it took
titttc to effectively develop. the
Albany fast break eventually tore
through the Lakers. The chief or-
cltestrator was guard Winston
Royal, whose pin—point passes cott-
sistently found Duties for easy
shots. Royal‘s ten assists fell one
short of the Albany record. and the
Dane captain also pumped in tett

points of his owrt, mostly by
swislting jumpers from long range.

"We were worried about them
possibly freezing the ball," corn—
meutcd Saucrs. “So our game plan
was to force a fast tempo. which is
more to our liking. and we were ef-
fective."

Two Royal passes set up identical
textbook fast breaks. and on botlt
occasions Stanish was the recipient.

bounce pass. and Stanish's lay-in

The Albany State Varsity Wrestl-
ing Team opened its 1979-80 cant-
paign this past weekend with a
Quadrangular meet in Oneonta.
The Danes wrestled dual matches
against Union. RPl, attd Oneonta.
defeating Union and RP] convinc-
ingly while losing to Oneonta by ort-
ly two points.

Albany’s first opponent was RM,
and the Dane wrestlers defeated six
of the ﬁrst eight RP! wrestlers,
ouickly compiling a 28-7 lead.
Albany State wrestling coach Joe
DeMeo then elected to forfeit the
last two tnatchcs to coast to a 28—19
victory.

Albany's next opponent was
Union College and the result was
another Dane victory. Dane
wrestlers defeated eight of Union's
ten wrestlers to take an impressive
3642 victory.

Otteonta was the Danes final 0p—
ponent. DeMeo had been resting
key wrestlers all afternoon so that
the team would be ready for this
tough opponent. Albany got off to
a fast start as Steve Zucker won by
forfeit at 118. and Seth Zucker
defeated his opponcttt 8-7 at 126.
l-lowie Berger then wrestled at 134
and was defeating his opponent 8-2
when lte dislocated his elbow.
Berger was forced to forfeit the
match and Oneonta was on the
scoreboard with a six point default.
Oneonta went on to will fotrr of the
last seven matches to narrowly
defeat Albany 21-19.

DeMeo was generally pleased
with the team's showing. citing ex—
cellent conditioning as the reason
for several close victories by Albany
wrestlers.

Albany wrestlers who were
undefeated for the afternoon were
Zucker at 118. Zamek at 126. Steve-

Cronitt at 167. Paul Hornbach at
177. and Vic Herman at 190. Pro-
bably the finest Albany perfor-
mance was that of their captain.

Hornbaclt. Hornbach pinned one I
opponent and defeated a second by 

a score of 18-7. His best perfor-

mance, however. was a 7~2 victory ‘

over Union‘s Matt Van Bentham.
DeMeo culled Van Bentham one of
the best 177 pouttdcrs ill the court-
try. uttd credited Horttbach's
superior physical conditioning and
mental toughness as the reasons for
tlte victory.

With Satrcrs starting Stanish in the

"1 was up for this game. and

combination of both."

Stanish’s contribution reﬂected
the Dane bench support. In the pro-
cess of outscoring the Laker
reserves 34-9. Albany’s depth saw
11 players score. as Sauers shuffled
players in and out of the game.
“l'm glad that everyone can get a
lot of playing time," Said Saucrs.
“1 think our depth is pretty good,
and l have to learn how and when
to use it."

After guard Bob Collier’s long
jump shot at the halftime buzzer
gave Albany a 37-20 cushion. the
Dane inside game began to
dominate the Lakcr postmen at the
start of the second half. Jones and
forward Joe Jednak took turns out-
muscling Oswego's Pinney-Chris
Wolfe-Pat Conlon front line. Jones
converted an offensive rebound in-
to a three-point play. then Jednak
banked home a basket, and Jones
duplicated his aggressive play with
another offensive rebound hoop to
increase the Dane lead to 44-22.
Then Royal got into the act. and his
passes set up Jednak for two easy
lay-ins, the second being called for
goaltending. Jednak tallied ten
points in the contest. while Jones
led a balanced Albany attack with

13 points and a team high seven re-
bounds. “Kelvin had one of his bet-
ter games." said Saucrs. “He seem—
ed more relaxed than he was itt our
ﬁrst game."
“i felt really good against

Oswego.” corntnented Jones. "1

Saucrs. “The otltcr teams coming in

to play better."

And so will the Lakers. if they
want to beat any teams. American
or otlterwise.

Iran Defenders To Protest

 

City Police Assure Protection -~

by Laura Fiorentlno

Having been assured of police
protection, the Ad Hoc U.S. Hands
Off lratt Committee announced
yesterday it will protest in front of
Chase Manhattan Batik this Satur-
day.

The grottp also expressed at the
press conference itt the State
Legislative building opposition to
U.S. tnilitary intervention in lratt
and its desire to see the Shah returtt
to lran.

The Ad l-loc Hands Off lratt
Committee will picket irt front of
the Cltase Manhattan Bank because
the chain is the main holder of the
Shah's trtoney.

The group originally planned to
protest last Saturday btrt was forced
to postpone the demonstration until
police protection could be provid-
ed.

The committee has been given
police protection tltrottglt ptrblic
statements rttude by Albutty Mayor
Frastus Corning and Albany Police
Chief Edward McCardle.

The demonstration will take
place in front of the Cltase Manhat-
tan Bank on State Street at 11:00
A.M.

Speakers at the press conference
Thursday were U.S. Hands Off
lratt Committee member Bill Hut-
ton. Rensseluer Polytech lttstittrte
(RPl) lrartian student Meltratt Ar-
bab, SUNYA RCO professor
Richard Wilkie, U.S. Hands Off
Iran Cotnrnittee member and
SUNY student ‘l‘otn Trubka and
Capital District Nuclear Alliance
representative Melanie Pores.

The group as a whole stressed the
importance of a non-violent protest.
it is not opposed to a peaceful
cottrttcr demonstration. “However. '
we are aware we cannot guarantee
the actions of those who might
come to counter demonstrate." said

Hutton. “this is why we need police
protection.“

According to i-lutton. the corn-
mittec believes the presence of rtaval
forces off the
threatening possibility to involve
the U.S. itt another Vict Nam.

“The experience of Viet Nurtt. in
which over 500,000 young
Americans and two rnilliort Indo-
Cltinese were killed. shows us the
destruction that can be brought to
our nation attd world peace frotn
the interference iii the internal af-
fairs of another nation," said Hut-
ton. llttttott uddcd,”the present
crisis is tltc result of U.S. in-
terference irt the internal affairs of
lratt for tire last 25 years. The U.S.
CIA pill the Shah irt power througlt
a coup it staged irt 1953. For the last
25 years of the Shah's reign. the
U.S. did everything it cottld to
strengthen his t‘yrunny."

The group feared that the U.S.
could be ptrslted into u war with
lratt on a wave of hysteria and anti»
lranian fear.

We believe that the demonstra-
tion this Saturday is part of a public
debate on whelltcr this brutal
dictator (Shah) sltottld be granted
asylum in this country, said Hut-
ton.

Rl’l student Meltrart Arbab said.
“I want the Atncrican people to
know wlto the real enemy is. The
Shah tnttrdered people irt lratt for
25 years. He will not hesitate to ptrt
both nations in war. . . know the
real enemy." ,

When asked if he felt tltc taking
ol American hostages was justified,
Arbub said, “It could not be
prcvcrttcd."

Arbab believes that none of the
hostages will be killed irt 1t'anunlcs..

said the Shah did not have to come

test U.S. govcrtttttettt actions.

“It‘s a sltutne that the U.S. has to
