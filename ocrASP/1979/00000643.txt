Movie, Opens Today

HOLLYWOOD (AP) “Star Trek

— The Motion Picture” blasts off

in 900 U.S. and Canada theaters

Friday. culminating the biggest

gamble in Hollywood history.
Consider the hazards:

OProduction costs set an allaime
record. reportedly at $42 million.

OThe movie is based on a televi-
sion series that failed in its first run.
though its reruns attracted a legion
of followers.

OThe stars are not exactly box-
office names: Leonard Nimoy.
William Shatner and DeForcst Kel-
ly front tlte series. plus lndia-born
Persis Khambatta as the bald llia
from Planet Delta Four.

OPopularity of the space spec—
tacular may ltavc peaked with “Star
Wars” and “Close Encounters of
the Third Kind."

Despite these drawbacks, Para-
mount Pictures executives say they
are jubilant over the finished film
and confident that the gamble will
produce heavy rewards.

The man most responsible for
sending "Star Trek” aloft is white-
ltaired director Robert Wise. The
producer was Gene Roddenberry.
creator of the TV series. At the end
of 22 months of intensive work.
Wise (“West Wlde Story", “The
Sound of Music") seemed both
relieved and exltilarated.

“l'm generally pleased with how
the pictttre tttrned out." he remark-
ed itt his modest office at the
western end of the Paramount lot
once RKO. where he started as a
cutter in 1933.

think‘ we succeeded.iThe look and
feel of the picture is good. the
characters are well developed. and
the story held up well. At least i
think so. We won’t really know un-
til the picture opens Friday. We had
no sneak previews. This is my 38th
ﬁlm and never before have i releas-
ed one without a sneak."

There was no time. Last Satur-
day. Wise was dubbing the sound
track at 2:30 a.m.. and looking at
composite reels at 3 a.m. He return-
ed at noon to correct a miscut in the
sound negative. then reviewed the
backup sound at 6 p.tn. That was
his last official act.

“They have been printing reels as
soon as i ﬁnished them." he said.
“This week i looked itt on Stage [2
at MGM and saw hundreds of ship-
ping cases. Some 360 were shipped
Monday, 300 Tuesday arid tltc rest
Wednesday." Wise worried that he
would have to hand carry a print to
the premiere itt Washington. l).(’.

continued from page three
from allegations that the Council
did not ﬁle their decision in the Pine
Circle case with ofﬁcial municipal
records. While the law allows for a
30 day filing period, Oliver claims
that the approval was never ﬁled at
all. "The Council has ignored the
explicit language in Section 38," he
said.
Pine Bush on Appeal

Oliver plans to appeal Conway's
decisions to the state Appellate
Division (Third Department) as
soon as the Supreme Court verdicts
are officially ﬁled. The attorney
suntmcd up his argument as "that.
ttunther one, the Board created an
ambiguity by failing to follow a
statutory procedure and. two, that
the Board gave misinformation
about when the decision was final."

Oliver sees the cases as following

Greyhound even ma

it. “I think that the Court of Ap-
peals cases are the controlling
cases," he said. “The precedents
have already been established and
they're contrary to Judge Conway’s
decision."

Dunes Precedent

Oliver cited July‘s "Dunes"
development suit as a primary
precedent in the present case. The
Dunes case dealt with the develop-
ment of a tract of Pine Bush land
adjacent to the territory involved in
the Pines Circle case. The case was
also heard before Conway in the
Court of Appeals.

“He threw it out on the basis that
we had no standing." said Oliver.
“You have to be an aggrieved party
—— you have to be injured. hurt.
concerned or have some legal in-
terest."

Although Conway ruled that the
parties to the suit lacked legitimate
legal interest, his decision was
reversed by the Appellate Division.

“The basis of the appeal was that
the Planning Board must consider
tltc interests of all residents of the
City of Albany." said Oliver.

Oliver is also making use of a
I‘lo‘) Court of Appeals case,
(‘uA'ItItvztItv Mole] v Schuyler. 24 Nl
2d l2(). “The case says that .v

shut to conduct a serious and
equitable review of "the issue we‘tt-
raised lll regard to the itttpt'oprietics

“They're playing a silly game
with the public." he said. “The law
requires thetn to do a specific net.
But failing to do this act. they are
putting tltc public in a position
where they have to guess when they
hate a right to sue. And I believe
that the Appellate Division will find
