Nuke Espionage

An east coast anti-nuclear
organization has filed suit against
three puclic tttilities and the New
Jersey State Police — charging
them with spying on and harassing
nuclear protesters over the past

The suit has been filed in a New

Tehran to help arrange the release
of American hostages was not too
