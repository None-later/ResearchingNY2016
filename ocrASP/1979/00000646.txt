The Life 

1.

 

I scanned the walls of my cell: the thick green walls en-
trapping me. The surface felt hard, unpenetrable. l was a
prisoner. doomed to wander between these walls, amid
others like myself, alone, confused, frightened segments
of a large population. Have we no leader? I cried into the
dark abyss, only vaguely aware of the others. Doomed, i
thought. to this cell. And then a voice came across from
the other side. We are guilty. lt echoed off the floating
particles in this suspended gell, this mass of life, lost; only
one cell. one walled-in part of God knows how many.
Guilty? Of what? Of wanting to live? Of secretly and
hopelessly craving the power to assert oneself, to smash
through the walls and to become a living thing? To have
free will? Guilty of that l was, and so were the others,
whether they admit it or not. That from which i sprung
oozed in the distance. That nucleus, originator, creator of
my hapless life moaned in the distance, “Ooh Babe".
And, oh. how i knew how comforting it was to float in
this dark. murky atmosphere, to drift in sight of the wall._
safe from the unknown but doubtless dangers on the
other side. Still, yet still, a seed must be planted, it must
grow alone and sprout and blossom. A plant may die but
its seed may live. A seed grows and dies, but life con-
tinues. That is power, the power to be a part of life, im-
mortal Iife. not cooped up in a cell, but free, free to grow
leaves that will pass the sky and touch the stars, free to

or A cell;- *

 

live, to be a free living, self-determining creation. That

 

freedom was deprived me in this cell, behind this wall.
These damn walls.

And then, a flow surged around me, this fluid mass
pushed me and others like me into and through a long,
winding canal. A change. An influx, an outflow, and life.
Creation. Birth. Around me were others like me. green
and growing, and no walls. And above. the sub, bright
yellow, beckoning: and within me, within my walls a

desperate voice crying, "Ooh Babe".

Begins inside a tiny seed

Provides the purest air you breathe”
