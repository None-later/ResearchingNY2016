stillness breathes tremors,

child-like: l floated along - tracing nebulous airy currents
in tender gardenl, my fingertips fondled translucent flowery creations

fragile pink shell feathers and precious amethyst drips in the mud

as flowing gestusz unfold center visions

an intimate pearl breaks open (scattering me),
spinning intricate creative projecti ms;

the slightest tides disclose their frolthy secrets
soul-foamy waves of random purpose
harbor egg cells of one-eyed starfish in suspended undulations.
bubbling orbs rise inwardly; reflect

our emerald quicksilver explorations
