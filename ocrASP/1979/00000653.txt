BROCI'ON N.Y. (AP) in the realm
of world—class weightlifting, where
tendons grow as thick as bridge
cables and arms as massive as der-
ricks. Don Reinhoudt has
shouldered aside the competition.

Reinhoudt thinks he really might
be the “World's Strongest Man" —
a title he won in a televised competi-
tion this summer.

How would he stack up against
the greatest athletes of all time?

“l'd have to be in the top five or
six." he said at his garage-now»
gymnasium in this Chautauqua
County community. “it's hard to
say because the lifts were different.
it’s sort of like putting Muhammad
Ali against the old-time boxers. But

 

l will say this : l think the contest
this summer was the truest all-
around test of strength in the
world."

During the three-day l0 event ex-
travaganza in Los Angeles last July.
Reinhoudt pulled. lifted and
sweated his way to ﬁrst place and
Sl2.900 in prize money.

The third-year show lured
furniture-sized men like Sweden's
Lars Hedlund and Reinhoudt by
baiting them with money — not
tnttch for tnost professional
athletes. but plenty by the standards
of weight lifters.

There was also a chance to find
out wlto could hit the tnost Playboy
bunnies or hoist a refrigerator the

Reinhoudt: World’s Strongest? ﬁscal-ct?” "-“°" 

“So you really can't know who's
strongest, but I have to think when
i set my power-lifting record 2,420
pounds for three lifts ln I976 l was.
The Olympic lifts are all technique;
they aren't a real test of strength.”
Reinhoudt said.

Power lifting. which is not an
Olympic event. is more popular in
the United States and produces
more competitors than the Olympic
lifts of military press. clean and jerk
and snatch, which involve different
motions to hoist a barbell overhead.

The three power events are a
knee-bending squat with a weight
on the shoulders; the bench press.

fastest and a shot at publicizing
their sport. Conspicuous by his
absence was Vasily Alexeev, a
350-pound world champion from
the Soviet Union.

“There wasn't enough money in
it for him.” said the 345-pound
Reinhoudt, a full-time physical
education instructor at the
Cassadaga job corps center. “I
don‘t think he'd have won anyway.
but the money wasn't there.
Every time he breaks a record. he
gets another Sl.500 bonus — that‘s
just a bonus.

“The Europeans are fantastic.
but can you imagine being paid just
to train and compete?

He said Alexeev. an amateur

Reinhoudt. 34, at one time held

Rookie William Andrews

Aims At Atlanta Record

ATLANTA (AP) Six months ago
unheralded rookie William An-
drews had only one goal — to make

become the leading rusher in the

“People keep asking me if I am
surprised." says Andrews. a No. 3
draft choice. “Not really. I always
thought l could run the football.
However. we had some other peo
ple in college who could. and l was
used primarily as a blocker."

With the Falcons. Andreus‘
blocking ability has been utilized
but the sturdy, (Hoot. 200 pounder
from Thomasville. Ga. has been a
dominant factor in running the
ball. So far Andrews has 932
yards in 207 attempts for a 45-yard
average and three touchdowns. He
has fumbled only once and that
came in a driving rainstorm. In ad-

dition. he has caught 32 passes for
235 yards and two TDs.

"i just wanted to make the
Atlanta Falcons — period. l ex—
pected to perform if given the
chance to play. I worked hard and
knew i could run if given the
chance." said Andrews. who im-

pressed the Falcons with his overall
ability as a blocker, runner and pass
catcher during July training camp.

“I had two other great runners
with me at Auburn in James Brooks
and Joe Cribbs who ran the ball
more titan I did. It turned out that
my talent was ltidden. I had to run
it out in the NFL," he said. Coach
Leentan Bennet admitted during the
preseason that Andrews was more
than the Falcons had expected.

“We were pleasantly surprised."
he said. “We knew he could block
but his running was an added
bonus. “We would very much like
to see hittt gel l.000~yard rusher in
the history of the franchise."

Dave Hampton did it in l975, '
gaining 1.002 yards.

Andrews needs 7l yards to snap
that mark Sunday when the Falcons
host the Los Angcles Rams in their
next-to-last game. ln addition. he
rushed for l67 yards against New

Orleans in the season opener for a
club record and had two other l00
yard games.

If Andrews goes over the 1,000
mark he will become only tﬁc‘lath
player in NFL history to reach that

goal itt his rookie season.
