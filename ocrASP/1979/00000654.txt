SYRACUSE N.Y2 (AP) Roosevelt
Bouie is tuning up his offensive
game for the 11th ranked Syracuse
University basketball team. which
ran its four-season home-court win
streak to 47 games Wednesday
night with a 93-60 trouncing over
St. Francis of Pennsylvania.

Bouie scored 21 points and pulled
down 12 rebounds during his 22
minutes in the game, leaving Coach
lim Boeheim satisﬁed that his
6~foot.l1 center is coming into his
own as an offensive player.

“That's the best he’s looked. He
was smooth. 1 think he's really
moving better to get the ball now.”
Boeheim said.

Although Bouie was the leading
scorer on last year’s 26—4 Syracuse
squad averaging 15 points a game.
he has been known for his defensive
play, especially his devastating
blocks that can make an opposing
player think twice before shoorting
a second time against the big center.

in Wednesday night’s victory.
Boeheim said Bouie may have been
too effective on defense.

“He protected the basket too
well. We knew he was there and we
got sloppy." said Boeheim.

Boeheim has been starting a
lineup that includes the 6-“ Danny
Schayes, the son of the former NBA
great Dolph Schayes. along with the
towering Bouie.

A major key to the Orangemen
this season will be senior forward
Louis Orr. who scored l7 points
and pulled in 10 rebounds in 22
minutes ofxlplay against St. Francis.

This season Boeheim has a strong
grouphof guards that has put former
starter Hal Cohen into a backup
role as he begins each game with
Eddie. Mass and Marty Headd on
the court.

“It's a luxury to have a guy like
that sitting there." Boeheim said of
the 6-0 Cohen, whom the coach in-
sisted will play as much as if he were
a starter.

And Boeheim usually plays many
players in each game and against St.
Francis Wednesday night no player
saw more than 25 minutes of action

outmanned visitors.

tunity to see what his team is made

Boeheim said.

The Orangemen are on the verge
of closing out the 19705 in Manley
Fieldhouse with only five losses
against more than 100 victories.The
last home games of the l970s will be

The Orangemen have won the
two previous Carrier Classics and
are favored to win a third title in
their home-court tournament.

In their 17 years in Manley
Fieldhouse. which was originally
built to provide the football team
with a sheltered practice area. the
Orangemen have been almost

unbeatable, running up a 180-27
record with their last home loss in
l976 when they were beaten by
Virginia Tech.

Logan. Paul Roby and Larry Tar-
rance each received three credits for
courses at Ottawa University. in Ot-
tawa. Kansas. but had never been
enrolled in them.

The spokesman. who asked that
he not be identified. said the players
told officials they had no

knowledge of how the credits got on
their transcripts and said the credit
hours should be removed.

The players are ineligible without
the credit hours. the spokesman
said.

Colgate No Match For Dane J. V. Squad, 74-59

by Marc Hespel

The Albany State men's junior
varsity basketball team remained
undefeated as they triumphed over
Colgate. 74-59. Wednesday evening
at University Gym. The win increas-
ed Albany's record to 3-0.

From the outset of the game.
Albany had an obvious advantage
because of Colgate's injury-riddled
squad. in fact. Colgate could only
send seven players to face Albany.

Still. because of their fine play
defensively as well as offensively,
Albany dominated the contest. The
ﬁrst half belonged to the Danes.
with Ray Edwards leading Albany's
potent scoring attack with ten
points in the half, as Albany com-
piled 35. At the same time. the
defense looked solid. allowing only
20 points. ‘

 

 

 

in the second half. Albany's
domination of the game continued.
in the early minutes of the half.
freshman guard Mike Gaines took
the scoring chores into his own
hands. Gaines put ten points on the
board in rather quick fashion. using
a stylistic combination of outside
shots and layups. one of which
came after Gaines stole the ball in
his. own backcourt. Along with
Gaines‘ impressive play. Albany's
defense contained its opposition.
never allowing Colgate to within is
points.

“The big thing was our defense.
but overall it was a good game. We
were not rushing at all. we had the
early lead and stuck to it." Gaines
said.

The game’s high scorers included

Edwards with [5 points. Gaines
with 14 points and Glenn Phillips
who did well coming off the bench
with M points also.

Forwards Rick Cornell. Edwards
and guard Brian Ranney played
very well defensively. Albany J.V.
Basketball coach Steve Kopp was
happy with his team's defensive
showing. noting that it was a great
improvement over last Saturday
night's game against Siena.

Certainly, Wednesday night's
performance had to please Kopp.
After the game. he remarked.
"Defensively. we did well; we turn-
ed steals into fast breaks and that
helped us. Overall, it was a line ef-
fort."

Albany‘s next game will be
against Albany Business College
tomorrow night at University Gym.

Women Cagers Show l-l Record

by Susan Milllgan

After securing an initial lead. the
Albany State women’s basketball
team lost control of the game and
fell to Oswego, 47-30 Tuesday
night.

"it was the turnovers that kill-

ed us," said coach Amy Kidder.

The women led Oswego at the
outset of the game. but a difficulty
in scoring kept Albany from winn-
ing. However. Kidder said. “our
offense has improved."

“We tried to slow down the game
so as not to throw away the ball,"
said Kidder. “But this strategy
resulted in 29 turnovers — it lost us
the game."

Albany did manage to keep
Oswego from scoring during the

but Oswego's good outside shooters
soon hiked their score.

Albany’s scoring was fairly COtl-
srstcnt: Colleen Thompson tallied
12 points; Luannc LaTonde. 8; Kim
lioerncr, 4; Laurie Briggs. 4; and
Mancy Hallcron, 2. Cheri Thuotte
also played an outstanding defen-
srvc game for Albany. substituting
as guard.

“The women have nothing to be
ashamed of." said Kidder. “They
had good percentage shots and
played an allover good game."

Small wonder the women are not
too disappointed. They had a ﬁrst-
game win under their belts. Albany
beat Skidmore 39-35 November
29th. it gave the relatively inex-

 

morc significantly. it was the
Albany State women's basketball
team's first win since 1977.

Albany had been losing by three
points after the first half. but a
change in both offensive and defcn~
sivc strategies brought them back to
a win.

“We've had a good mtm-Io-mun
defense." said Kidder. “Once we
got the lead. we just hung on until
the end of the game."

Nancy Hullcron led the learn with
[2 points. followed by Luanne
Lal.onde with 7. Colleen Thomp-
son and Laurie Briggs with 6 apiece.
Kim Boerncr with 4 and Teresa
Clark and Eileen Fatcheric with 2
points apiece. Luannc Lal.ondc
also played an outstanding defen-
sive game.

After a winless campaign last season. Albany's women's basketball squad broke that streak with a win in their
season opener over Skidmore. A loss to Oswcgo evened their record at 1-1. (l'holo: Mark liillck)

Gymnasts Lose

Despite two outstanding in-
dividual performances. the Albany
State gymnastics teum dropped
their first match of the season, on
Tuesday. losing to the host
lirockport squad. Brockport total-
ed ll3.15 points to Albany's 92.95.

Albany was forced to compete
without the services of team captain
Kathy Chemotti. who injured her
arm in a practice session on Mon—
day. A stellar performer in the all-
around exercises, Chemotti will be
sidelined until after the holiday
break.

Albany did have a
