Although the season is only one
week old, the Danes remained
undefeated Wednesday night by
downing a young Binghamton out-
ﬁt 81-66 in University Gym for their
thrid victory and ﬁrst in the
SUNYAC conference. The most in-
teresting aspect of the otherwise
dull contest was that Albany's deep
squad had produced its' third
outstanding individual perfor-
mance.

The first was guard Rob Ciune's-
career high 29 poitlts including l4
straight down the stretch in the
Danes impressive win at Kings Col-
lege. Last Saturday in a 30 point
romp over pitiful Oswego it was
captain Winston Royal who shone

with a 10 point, to assist effort.
On Wednesday against the Col-
onials it was junior Pete Stanish
who stood out. Stanish came off the
bench shooting and literally did not
miss in the 15 or so minutes he
played. Only eight seconds after
entering the game with “:35 left in
the first half. Stanish dribbled
quickly into the lane and lofted a
soft one-handed shot that hit
nothing but net. The aggressive 6-2
forward also hit his next five shots
to finish with l3 points on perfect

Strong Relays Help Swimmers

The LG Albany State Men's Var—
sity Swim Team Tllcsday night
defeated the 0—! Oswcgo Lakcrs in a
dog-ﬁght battle. by the score of
67—45.

Coach Ron White felt that “we
needed this win to get ottr spirit go-
ing." “A really impressive"
Oswego squad gave the Danes a
“very competitive -— rigllt down to
the last relay" meet. added Wllite.

The Danes took first place
finishes in both of the relay events.

the team of Steve Bonawitz. Torn
Roberts. Dave Zybala and Kevin
Ahern edged out their opponents by
three tenths of a second. White felt
that “the last relay was
phenomenal."

Two records were broken; one a

 

school record, the other. a pool
record. The new school record. at-
taitled by Steve Bonawitz itl the 200
yard Backstroke totally decimated

and one free throw.

“i know that with the way our
offense works if l keep moving 1'"

fidence in my shot.” commented
Stanish on his hot hand.

Albany used four Colonial tur-

tlovers to stretch an initial 7-0 blitz
into a 19-10 lead at the midway
point of the first half. However,
were it not for defensive lapses that
allowed the visitors several easy in-
side hoops the lead would have been
greater.
. “We made several defensive
mistakes in the first half." said
Albany coach Dick Sauers. “When
the less experienced players were in
we had breakdowns ~ especially
when we changed defenses."

Royal concurred. “When we
switched defenses on the court there
was a communication problem. Not
everyone heard the changes.”

The result was seven inside points
by certer Rick Wunder and six for
Mark Abruscato which kept
Binghamton within striking
distance.

For the remainder of the half
Sauers sllunncd the l-3-l zone that
had been victimized in favor of a
tough man to mall that pltt the
clamps on the Colonial's offense.

The Danes then began atl inside
attack oftheir own. Sophomore Joe
chnnk threw in nine first half
markers while center Kelvin Jones
bttlled his way for half of his team
high l6 points to help Albany
balloon its' lead to 4l-25 at
halftime.

Ciune. who was forced to the
bench with three fouls. was replac-
ed in the second half line-up by
Stanish. whose three consecutive
baskets along with Jones' prctty
finger roll shot quickly gave the
Danes an 18 point advantage.

Albany finally put Binghamton
away four minutes later with seven
straight points and a 62-4i lead that
prompted coach John Affleck to
remove his entire starting five at the
8:57 mark.

The remainder of the contest was
sloppily played as both coaches
substituted freely. Heins. though.
remained hot. ﬁnishing with a game
high 20 points including 16 in the
final 20 minutes.

"We played only as well as we
had to." surmised Sauers. “l’m not
really pleased with our perfor-
mance."

What did please him was the play
of both Stanish and SteVe Low off
the bench and the team‘s 43-32 edge
on the boards.

“Pete has played well in every
game off the bench. Low had a
good game defensively —- he's
much tougher physically this year.“

called for a “position freeze." rc-

DOB policy will be to not let'-

vacancies are created, to leave a cer-

Cronin.

According to SUNY Assistant
Vice Chancellor for Finance and
Business Bill Anslow. SUNY of-
flcials are currently negotiating with
the DOB to “accept realistic
figures."

He added that wllilc no specific

Demonstrators Clash OVer [fan

by Laura iiiorenllno

Approximately 75 demonstrators
urging the return of the Shah of
Iran pickctcd outside tlle Chase
Manhattan Batik otl State Street
Saturday.

The protest. orgatli/cd by the US
Hands Off iratl Committee was met
by a group of about 50 counter-
dcmonslrtttors who chanted "USA
all the way" and “bomb the
bastards."

Police officers responding to the
group’s request for PWlCUliOn WL‘rL‘
forced to form at barricade between
the two groups to maintain order.
Also on hand were marshals wcar-
itlg green arm bands. According to
ml Itm' US Hands Off ifitll member
Hutton. “they were assigned by the
ad lmc committee to keep the picket
litlc moving."

People wearing signs saying
“legal observer” were also present.
“in case anything happens these
people could look at the itlcidctlt
objectively." said US Hands Off
irtln spokesperson Nelly Brown.

The protesters pickctcd the Chase
Manhattan Bank because it is tllc
“main holder of the Shah‘s
money...tllollsutlds of dollars stolen
from the iratliall people." accor-
ding to a committee flyet‘.

Tllc demonstrators who obtained
it city parade pe'mit for the
demonstration pcacciully chanted
“the Shah has a friend at Chase
Manhattan" and “no tllorc Vict-
Ilams. stop the war plan against
lran."

The group believes the lratlian
people suffered under the Shah.
Billions of dollars ill oil revenues
were divided between outside cor-
porations arid the Shah while
millions of lratliuns were kel’l in
poverty, Hutton said.

Hutton added that the US
goverlltllcllt precipitated tllc current
crisis through its 26 year presence ill
iron and by allowing the Shah to
enter our country. America‘s
refusal to recognize the lrallians‘
demand to return the Shall to stand
trial for his crinlcs has further ug-
grtlvatcd this situation.

The coulltcr-dettlotlstrators fre-
quently shouted obscenitics and
threats to the group and carried
signs which read. “Uncle Sam is
pissed" alld “hostage taking is law
breaking." At one poitll the group
broke itlto a chorus of “God iiiess
America."

Two Women Assaultecli

By“Pine Hills Toucher ”

Two women living ill the Pine Hiiis section of Albany were
assaulted itl separate attacks this weekend by a man known as tllc

Neither of the victims was raped or seriously injured.
A composite of the alleged attacker has been drafted by the
Albany Police. dcpictitlg a black mart of about 5‘10" with close-

Tlte first assault took place at 2:30 a.nl. Saturday on lilbcrotl
Street. Lieutenant .lolltl Reid said the attacker apparently etltccrcd a
woman's second—ﬂoor apartment through all open porch.

The woman. who was asleep ill her bed. awoke to find a man who
told her to be qttict and ltot to move. He then tried to pltt a pillow on
her face but she screamed, scaring the attacker away.

The second attack occllred on Ontario Street at 1:00 a.tll. Sunday.

The woman was lying on a couch when an unknown black male.
5'8-10" tall. wearing a green army—type jacket with a hood. atld blue
jeans. pushed her to the floor and fondled her. said police.

He ticd one of tile woman's arms to a radiator after she struggled.

The attacker apparently entered through an unlocked first-floor

in addition, if positions are con-

tinually eliminated. “we may have
to get rid of departments." she
said.
-. Cronin predicted larger classes.
fewer courses. and a reduction of
student services will result from the
DOB's actions. "There will be a
lower educational quality.

“There are usually not this m any
cuts. It's not politically good to cut
faculty. They can no longer keep
doing this." added Cronin. citing
the possibility of evaluation-based
departmental retlrenchments.

According to Ward, the l975-76

budget called for a $56 million "

reduction SUNY-wide. for pur-
poses of the next year. While citing
the retrenchment of programs and
faculty in that year. she predicted a

l more gradual budget decrease with

less resultant economic effect.

“We lost $260 million over the
past four years in budget cuts," she
said. "There has also been a
$46,000 decrease in faculty and stu-
dent services. lt's hurting us. This is
the stupidest way in the world to cut
a budget.”
