Turk Seizure Cited As American Plot

of hard fighting In. which Kho-

meini's supporters recaptured the _

slon in the northwest city .but

Meanwhile, the situation of the,
U.S. hostages in'the American Em-
bassy in Tehran remained unchang-
ed on their 37th day in captivity.
But a U.N. spokesman said
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim
was sending the foreign minister of
Sri Lanka to visit the hostages, and
the United States was to present its
case against Iran to the Interna-
tional Court of Justice in The
Hague.

Iran was boycotting the court ses-
sion.

Khomeini's Revolutionary Coun-
cil sent Finance Minister
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and two
other officials to Tabriz to try to
end the live-day-old rebellion by the
Turkish Azaris, the fourth of Iran's
ethnic minorities to take armed ac-

a

tion in support of their demands for
autonomous home rule.

The Turks seized the local radio
station, the governor's mansion and
the airport Thursday. Local army
units were reported residing with
the rebels.

Early Sunday revolutionary
guards recaptured the governor's
mansion, and some 4,000 Khomeini
supporters prayed at the university
next door, then rushed and seized It
from 20 to 30 armed Turks.

Hundreds of Turks shouting
“Death to Khomeinll" marched on
the station, and the Khomeini
forces opened fire. Tens of
thousands of Turks and local army
units joined the march, rushed the
hilltop station and retook it.

Iran To Boycott Session And Try Hostages

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)
the United States. already conn‘
dent it has world opinion on its
side seeked'the backing of the World
Court on Monday in its confronta-
tion with Iran.

U.S. spokesmen here said they
hope the court — formally the In-
ternational Court of Justice — will
agree to take the case and decide in
favor of U.S. claims against the
rcgitne of Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho-
mcini.

But the most important thing.
they said, is that the court speak out

Americans held hostage by mllltant
Iranians iii the US Embassy in
Tehran. The takeover of the em-
bassy Nov. 4 and the militants'
demands that the deposed Shah of
Iran be extradited to Iran touched
off a showdown that quickly reach-
ed a stalemate and has not been cas-
cd dcspitc international efforts.

In Iran, Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh said Saturday night
that tile ruling Revolutionary Coun-
cil had decided against sending a

representative to the court.

"We don't officially approve of
the court so we aren’t par-
ticipating," he was quoted as telling
reporters, adding that the govern-
ment would make an official an-
nouncement on its refusal to attend
“in one orttvo days."

Iran refused to attend a U.N.
Security Council meeting on the
crisis. and has refused to comply
with a Security Council resolution
calling for release of the hostages,
so it would come as no surprise here
if lrrtn did not send a representative
to the court '5 opening hearing Mon-
day.

One U.S. official iii The Hague,

who asked not to be identified,
said, "We will pursue the case even

President Carter has sent At-

handle the U.S. case.

U.S. spokesmen said they hoped
the court would agree to take the
case and agree with the U.S. claim

The official Paris news agency

Sadcgh told the Associated Press
that Efty must leave “as soon as

The ruling Revolutionary Coun-

filed Sunday from Tabriz in which
he said shouts of “Death to Klto-

The Turks also retook the gover-
nor’s mansion, seized a police sta-
tion and apparently retained con-
trol of the airport throughout the
day’s violence. They erected
roadblocks around Tabriz and sear-
ched vehicles to bar Khometnt’s
supporters from reaching the city of
600.000, Iran's third largest. _
Khomeini said in a Tehran Radio
broadcast that the Tabriz rebellion
was the work of “plotters who
receive their orders from America
and elsewhere" and his regime

tional law. But Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance also asked the court
for an immediate appeal for the
release of the hostages.

Ghotbzadeh said lran would
boycott the court session and would
set up its own international panel to
investigate “practically all" of the
hostages for spying.

He told NBC-TV's Meet The
Press he hoped to have the panel
members chosen within 10 days.

“They will be people front
around the world ‘who would be in-
volved, not governments," he said.
"It's more or less going to be a
grand jury and 'll be an overall in-
vestigation of wnat has happened in
Iran."

He also said his government
would “not worry at all" if the
United States tried to put an em-

Economics May Be The Key

LONDON (AP) Secretary of State ‘

Cyrus R. Vance tnct with leaders of
the British govertuncnt today to try
to enlist it in plan,» for joint
economic retaliation if Iran refuses
to release the 50 American
hostages.

Hopes for a negotiated settlement
with Iran appeared dint. A senior
U.S. official said the situation was
"very delicate". and reporters were
told their was “faint hope" the
hostages would be freed Scott.

The United States has already
ended almost all trade with Iran by
freezing Iranian funds in American
banks. But to tighten the econotnic
screws, the Carter administration
wants the West Europeans to sup-
port sanctions il' Iran does not
rcleasc the hostages and puts any of
them on trial as spies.

for his actions to overthrow Shah
and for a time thought that the only
way to end Shah's regime was
through some religious leadirtg and
backing. Beyond that, i can’t im-
agine how a country can be run
socially, politically, and
economically by strict religious
rules and religious figures and
clergymen."

The fall of the Shah was in-
evitable, necessary, and desired,
Yamntin believes, by all factions of
Iranian society. He said the
atrocities committed by the Shah
were common knowledge (and now
on public records) and that the
revolution was brewing long before
it actually erupted.

“It happened very quickly on the

 

' ’r‘rll‘ln-n'  “oh-«I3

surface yet underneath there were
factors that affected the whole
course of evolution."

“It's difficult to understand con-
tempt for a monarch. He had a
secret police (Savak) to protect the
monarchy. Over 35 years of his
rule. it expanded to cope with the
growing opposition. it's very
natural that people gradually get
unhappy with such a dictatorship:
people don't like to live under that
type of rule."

Yammin maintains that the sud-
den religious nature of Iran was ac-
tually there all along, deeply rooted
in its majority. Even in urban areas.
he said. the bulk of citizens were
somewhat practicing Moslems.

"There were two sides to a per-
son, and when the call came they
put aside their non-religious side
arid used their religious one for that
particular purpose.”

"The majority, he feels, did not
have a total religious state in mind,
but as the revolution continued,
and no political parties were in
sight, the religion prevailed. The
role of the mullas (religious ﬁgures)
became more signiﬁcant as they
gained full control of the media. In
addition, the mostly illiterate public
is lntensely under the Ayatollah's
influence. Yammin sees the present
situation as a possible stepping
stone towards a new dictatorship,
one under the guise of a divine law.

“Three years ago you wouldn't

see these religious aspects.
Nightclubs, bars, and restaurants
have closed down. There is very
serious censorship on T.V.. theatre,
and movies — at this point. it is a
dictatorship — it seems to me."
, "Most of the people are illiterate
in iron. and are very vulnerable to
information, especially from such a
religious figure (Khomeini). They
don't think lte will make mistakes in
leading and won't question his
leadership. Since he was successful
itt overthrowing the powerful Shah
they tltink he will lead thent lo suc-
cess."

Although he seriously doubts
Kltomeini's ability to properly rttn
the country and restore it front an
cconontic depression, Yamntin said
that strong trope is rampant
throughout Iran.

“Ilascd on their religious beliefs,
they think this is their destiny —
their wnv In act more happiness.

Since people are not spending,
eating, and doing as much, their
desires are less and the problems are
not felt as much. Overall.
economically, everyone has suf-
fered to some extent. The situation
is not good —,this is obvious from
here —— but there’s hope.”

Yammin has a bitter resentment
towards the Shah and supports the
belief that the deposed, aging
leader used his powerful position to
amass great personal wealth at the
expense of the Iranian people.

“Those in the royal family engag-
ed in many business activities and
used their inﬂuence to get privately
rich — in a corrupt manner. While
over the course of Shah’s rule he
got tremendously rich, the towns
and villages remained backwards in
comparison with towns in other
Arab states. The rural areas were
left to rot."

Yamntin doesn’t understand why
such a rttlcr was allowed entry into
the U.S. but said he can see why it
would not be wise for America to
simply release htrn now.

“No matter ltow sick he was. it's
ttot a good cttouglt reason to let him
in. Tltcrc are many sick people itt
the world."

“i can see it clearer from the U.S.
view more titan lrttn's though. I see
the complications thc U.S. is fac-
ing. Not returning the Shah is a
matter of many considerations;
prestige, his life. etc."  ‘

' executed from the Shah's reglrne.

Most probably weren’t as guilty ‘as
he 'was. It’s only fair that he’s tried
somehow.” '

Yammin expressed that he is a
non-violent person and believes
there is a non-violent way to solve
all problems. He wants no one to be
killed and sees no justiﬁcation in
taking lives, or taking hostages.

"They could have broken U.S.
relations before taking the embassy.
It's hard for me to see religious peo-
ple acting in a non-religious way. I
don’t understand why they're let-
ting civilians take the embassy and
handle things. That’s enough to
make me question the government‘."

“It seems to me that the country
is staying in thlsstate of revolution
intentionally. They overrcacted to
Shah's presence here and have pro-
moted the idea of forcing the U.S.
to return him."

Yammin sees one reason for the
strained relations attd negotiations
between the two nations as a pro—
blcm of plain communication.

“Khomeini speaks a very simple
language —— that’s ltow he gets
through to people. It's very difficult
to translate simple language into
understandable diplomatic terms
for the American people, leaders,
and press. That's probably why
there’s a lot of contradictions."
