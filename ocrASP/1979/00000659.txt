Alive With Elvis

Did Elvis Presley fake his own
death? And is the former King of
Rock and Roll now touring the
country under the name "Orion".
still entertaining his fans?

Believe it or not. this theory is be-
ing widely circulated by at least two
national tabloids. They claim that
Elvis is still alive.

According to this theory. Elvis
felt he had become a captive of his
fame and fortune, and he decided
to stage his own death in August of
1977. l’rcsley is said to have im-
ported a very ill man who looked
just like him. and then — til'tcr tlte
Elvis look-alike died — laid the im-

Graceland Mansion in h'ICiiileiS.

Orion. A new album by the masked
singer, Orion, has been released on
Elvis's original label, Sun Records.
and a second LP is scheduled for
release tltis week.

Despite the rumors that Orion
really is Elvis, the owner of Sun
Records is denying the accuracy of
the reports. Sun's Shelby Singleton.
while insisting “Orion sounds more
like Elvis than Elvis did." states
llatly that Orion is iioi Elvis
Presley.

Singleton admits tltat. in spite of
his denials, thousands of fans ap-
parently believe that the masked
singer touring the U.S. today really
is Elvis Presley. Thai shouldn't

The Best Policy?

in an effort to save the cost of
hiring people to go around and read
water meters, officials inn Mich
village decided last year to put their
town on the honor system.
Residents were asked to read their
own meters and send in figures for
billing.

Since then. town officials report
that 78 million gallons of water
have mysterioust "evaporated."

not shown up on water bills. He

says the missing water has cost the

community $36 thousand.

King says he's asking village of-
ﬁcials to end the honor system and
send out meter readers again.
