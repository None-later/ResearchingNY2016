American Gymnasts Perform Well '

FORTH WORTH. Texas (AP) The
20th World Gymnastics Champion-
ships will go down as Nadia’s la-
ment.

Nadia Comaneci came to Texas
in great form — the best since the
1976 Olympics when she captivated
the world with her daring and talent
as a 14-year-old pony-tailed pixie.

Yet. she was to leave in the early
morning hours today for Bucharest
with a draining tube in her left hand
as antibiotics fought a nasty infec-
tion. Doctors said it could be mon-
ths before she competes again
following Saturday's surgery.

The only medal she won was the
gold for Romanian women’s team
championsip. it was her 9.95 in the
beam. which she painfully touched

' three times during the performance.
' that saved the team title.

Her absence in the all-around and
the event ﬁnals was a bitter disap-

But there were some big sur-
prises.

Kurt Thomas and Bart Conner
gave America hope for the 1980
Olympics in Moscow with brilliant
final-day performances. Thomas
won two golds and two silvers in the
medal events and Connor earned a
gold and a bronze.

They got standing ovations from
football-conscious Texans, as if the
Dallas Cowboys had made a goal-
iine stand. The Texans discovered
that gymnastics is a contact sport.
as every major team was hit by in-
juries.

Dozens ot' protests were filed by
coaches who complained about the
political makeup of the judges. The
Italian team. miffed by their
women‘s low scores. walked out of
the competition Wednesday.

Other surprises included the
shocking bronze medal won by the

There also was the equally stunning
display of ineptitude by the
American women. which prompted
their coach to call them “fat” and
promised a get-tough attitude
before the Olympics.

There was the final decline of
27-year—old Nikolia Andrianov, the
Russian lion. who roared no more
and yielded his throne to coun-
tryman Alexandre Ditiatin.

There was the fall of the Japanese
men's team and fading stars Eizo
Kenmotsu and Shigeru Kasamatsu.
yielding to the superior depth of the
Soviet team.

There was the amazing victory of
the Romanian women over the
Soviet Union. with Comaneci riding
the bench in three of four events.

Romanian women's Coach Bela
Karoly said he welcomed the chance
for the team to compete without
Nadia.

Pass Steelers M ondayNite

HOUSTON (AP) Dan Pastorini’s 25-yard touchdown pass to Ken
Burrough just before halftime. two Toni Fritseh ﬁeld goals and Rob
Carpenter's 4-yard scoring run with 2:!!! remaining gave Houston a
20-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers Monday night and kept
alive the Oilers’ hopes for a National Football League division cham-
pionship.

Carpenter’s sweep into the left corner of the end zone ciimaxed a
69-yard. eight-play drive and turned out to be the winning
touchdown when the Steelers — limited to it Matt Bahr ﬁeld goal in
the thir- neriod - erupted for two touchdowns in the closing
minutes. AI. ‘ fl - . moment. with the Oilers' three-point lead sud-
denly very in i danger. it appeared Pittsburgh might get a shot at
another score.

The Steelers pount ' In an onside kick with i218 to go following
Terry Bradshaw's 34-yaII' wmehdown pass to John Stallworth. But
Pittsburgh was flagged for touching the ball before it had gone the
required 10 yards and on the next kickoff, the Oilers got the ball and
ran out all by the ﬁnal seconds.

The victory avenged Houston's 38-7 mauling at Pittsburgh on the
second Sunday of the season. it also pulled the Oilers into a ﬁrst-
place tie with the Steelers in the American Conference’s Central Divi-
SlOn.

Each team is il-4 with one regular-season game to go.

But the Oilers' dreams of their first title since they won the Eastern
Division crown in the t967 American Football League season, are
