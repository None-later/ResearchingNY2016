- syrdcuse Takes Carrier

Classic With 72-70'Win

(AP) The men had it tough and the
ladies easy, but the New York state
college basketball tournament pic-
ture was colored orange for
Syracuse this weekend.

The IZth-ranked Orangemen
were pushed into overtime at
friendly Manley Fieldhouse before
nipping Illinois State, 72-70, to win
their own Carrier Classic tourna-
ment.

Meanwhile in Rochester, the
Orangewomen romped over
Niagara. 70-56, to win the upstate
end of the Manufacturer's Hanover
Invitational tournament and a trip
to Madison Square Garden for the
ﬁnals. Syracuse will meet downstate
champ Queens on Dec. 22 as part of
a women’s triple-header at the
Garden.

Other tournament winners this
weekend were Colgate, which edged
Carleton University of Canada,
39-37, in the Big Red Classic; Hart-
wick, which downed Assumption,
80-71. in the Assumption Classic;
Rochester Tech. which squeaked
past Rochester, 59-58, in the Lin-

which nipped Utica. 67-35. in the
Utica Tipoff tourney, and New

day tournament.

“We had a couple of chances to
put them away,” said Syracuse
Coach Jim Boeheim, “but
cverytime we put a nail in their cof-
fin they'd sit back up and take it
out. I thought we had them ﬁve
times. but they kept coming back."

Syracuse escaped when Illinois
State guard Dale White missed a
desperation 25-foot jumper with
four seconds left in overtime. White
kept Illinois in the game by canning
six points in the overtime session,
ﬁnishing with I4.

Six-eleven center Roosevent
Bouie, who was named the tourna-
ment‘s Most Valuable Player, and
6-8 forward Louis Orr dominated
the inside game for Syracuse,
ﬁnishing with 22 and i7 points
respectively, but Illinois State’s out-

Produces Winning Squads

(AP) Dave Maurer's 98-15-3 record
is the best among active coaches
with at least five seasons in National
Collegiate Athletic Association
Division III football.

But the-.AB-year-old Maurer, ﬁve
times Ohio Conference Coach of
the Year in his iI Wittenberg
University seasons, passes the credit
on to his predecessor, Bill Edwards.

“He got the ball rolling and I
continued it," Maurer said of his
old boss.

“Success breeds success. Winn-
ing breeds winning and the greatest
reason for our success is Edwards. I
have equaled his wins at Wit-
tenberg, but I never will equal his
contribution to Wittenberg,” said
Maurer.

Still, Maurer has produced three
unbeaten squads among his seven
Ohio Conference title-holders.
Three have won Stagg Bowls, two
have captured NCAA national
crowns and the last two have been

the national runner-up. The 14-10
loss to Ithaca in the I979 national
title game was a disappointing one
after the Tigers had bowed to
league rival Baldwin-Wallace in the
1978 championship. ‘

“The best team lost the football
game. Last year, we were beaten. I
was disappointed for my seniors.
They did it all except win the big-
gies,” said the Tigers’ coach.

In the last four seasons, Wit-
tenberg compiled 38 victories and
just ﬁve defeats and won the con-
ference crown three times.

“I love Division III football," he
said. “Our kids want to win as
much as those at Ohio State Univer-
sity, those with the Green Bay
Packers. or those anywhere.

"We win because it is a great
school and because we have a great
coaching staff. ldon’t know ifl am
a good head coach. but I know I
was a good assistant coach.

Angelcs Rams set a National Foot-
ball Lengue record by winning their
seventh consecutive division title
while the Miami Dolphins also won
a division crown and San Diego,
Pittsburgh and Houston were
assured of wild-card playoff berths

The Rams, after a slow start this
season, won their fourth game in a
row, trouncing the Atlanta Falcons
34-13 to clinch the National Foot-
ball Confcrencc West title. Three
other teams — Cleveland, Min-
nesota and Dallas — had won six

Detroit Lions 28-10 while the New

MANHATTAN
IS MISSING!

That's right, Manhattan is missing for upstate New

York college students when you return to your Long
Island homes via Greyhound. Now you can schedule
trips direct to any one of eight Greyhound suburban
stations on Long Island.

Go Greyhound to miss Manhattan when you go to

Hem stead, Queens Village, Smithtown, Hicksville,
Huntington Station, Massapequa, Bay Shore or
Riverhead.

Greyhounds reasonable fares make going home
easier on the bank account. And if you're caught short,

you can have Mom and Dad prepay the ticket in your
hometown for pickup at your nearby college
Greyhound station.

it
the way

So if you‘re headed for your Long Island home and
on want to miss Manhattan, remember Greyhound IS
to get there and back again.

down in the small type of the con-
tracts that‘s botching up the
trades," commented Sparky Ander-
son, the silver-thatched shaper of
world champion teams at Cincin-
nati now plotting another empire
with Detroit's kiddie corps.

“You wouldn't believe some of
the conditions that these guys, with
the help of their agents, get incor-
porated into these agreements."

Oh yes, we would, Sparky.

Take Rico Carty, the Toronto in-
fielder. His contract includes 32
pages, provoking teammates to kid,
“llcy Rico, you can't carry that
around in your hip pocket."

Rico doesn't talk about the
details. Neither does his agent. The
club similarly respects his privacy.
lint it has leaked out that among
Carty's provisions are that he be
nllowcd to play winter ball, serve as
a scout in the Dominican Republic
in the off»scason, drive a private
limousine (is it really a Mercedes?)
and always get a king-sized bed on
the road.

Since free agency came along and
ball players fch naked without an
agent or a lawyer at their elbow,
such provisions have become com-
monplacc.

The society word for them are
“special covenants".

More than exorbitant salary
dcmtulds, these llttle lcaultulu
jewels stuck at the en
agreements are the bane of club
owncrs and general nutnagers.

M. Donald Grant. the New York

Such trivittlitics as single rooms,
king-sized beds, no-trade-no-cut
provisions, bonus and option
clauses, big loans at negligible in-
terest have become run of the mill.

Pitcher Ilcrl lllylcvcn of the
Pirates, for instance. has a contract

that continues into the year 2003.
But even he is upstaged by his hulk-
ing, power-hitting teammate, Dave
Parker.

Parker has a $4 million-plus con-
tract which could reach SI million a
year before the end of his five years.
But that’s just the beginning. When
