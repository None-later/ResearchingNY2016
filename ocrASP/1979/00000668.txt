(AP) Last year, the Duke basketball
team had a devil of a time living up
to Its advance notices. It seems to be
a no-sweat situation this year,
however. .

“Duke is‘making a joke of col-
lege basketball," said East Carolina
Coach Dave Odum after losing a
92-73 decision to the nation’s
second-ranked college basketball
team. “Their talent and their
coaching is super great . . ..1 don't
know how much better they can
get.”

That’s what they said last year,
when Duke returned the same
power-packed lineup that played in
in: NCAA ﬁnals against Kentucky
in. 1978. But something inexplicable
happened to Blue Devils in their
supposed "season of destiny" and
not only didn’t they win the NCAA
championship, they didn't even win
their own Atlantic Coast Con-
ference title.

But despite the loss of backcourt '

star Jim Spanarkel, Duke opened
this year with a victory over highly- '
regarded Kentucky in the season-
jumping Hall of Fame game in Spr-
ingfield, Mass” in November. And
Saturday night’s victory behind
Mike Gminski's 26 points was the
Blue Devils‘ fifth straight. The Blue
Devils took control in the second
half after East Carolina had held
the ACC powerhouse to a halftime
tie.

“Our second half was all defense
and team offense with fast-
breaking. running and everything,"
said Duke Coach Bill Foster. “We
looked a lot better."

Meanwhile. Michigan pulled off
the weekend‘s only upset of a Top
Twenty team with a 63-60 decision
over No. 16 Marquette.

said Notre Dame Coach Digger

Gymnasts Gain Split In

by Kathy Perilli .

in their ﬁrst home meet of the
season on Saturday, the Albany
State women’s gymnastics team
beat New Paltz but lost to the
University of Rhode Island on a tri-
meet.

“We were paced again by
freshman Elaine Glynn," said
Albany gymnastics coach Pat
Duvail-Splllane. Glynn placed se-
cond in all around with a score of
29.25 (only .45 nway from ﬁrst
place Citrista Rao of Rhode Island).

She also placed first in floor exer-
cises, second on the uneven bars.
and third in vaulting.

The coach feels that the uneven
bars and vaulting seem to be the
team’s strong points this Season.
Although Glynn was the only one
able to score on the bars. freshman
Lee Eisner scored a 6.75 on a hand-
spring vault and Lori Vein scored
6.4 on another vault. Gail Goldstein

Illness Hampers Women 

by Mike Dunne

This past weekend was one the
Albany women's swimming team
would like to forget.

On Friday the women made the
long trek to Plattsburgh only to
come away with a disappointing
91-48 setback. In Potsdam on
Saturday, Albany was blown out by
the powerful Bears 103-36.

coach Sarah Bingham’s squad
has been decimated by illnesses to
six team members during a grueling
stretch of nine meets in just five
days, which are major reasons for
the double losses.

“We swam very poorly over the
weekend but many of our problems
were a result of not having healthy
swimmers —- especially when we
had ﬁve days of hard swimming."
commented Bingham.

Plattsburgh is not regarded as a
strong team and Bingham felt that
her team had a shot at winning
despite the illnesses.

"Plattsburgh was a big disap-

Albany-82.2. and New Paltz-53.15.

"i feel the judges we had were
top-notcli, said Duvall-Splllaiie,
“so the scores should be prctt;
much indicative of how we should
do during the season."

The next home meet will be after
vacation, January 26, against Nor-
theastern and the University of Ver-
mont. “They’re two very good
schools -— if people want to see
some really good gymnastics. that's
a good meet to come to," remarked
Duvall-Spillane.

game into overtime with a soft orie-

ABC had a chance to pull away in

down by two, Gaines took the bail

tion, dribbled behind his iiack and
hit an 18 foot jumper to tie it up at
84-84 with 2:00 left to go. Albany
pulled ahead for keeps when, with
0:52 remaining, Phillips grabbed a
rebound, went the length of the
court on a three-on-onc break, and
fed Gaines for the layup after a iiif-
ty fake.

With the Danes tip by one, the
stall offense worked superbly, as

was a factor. “Our bignieii were
playing their bigrticn tough
underneath in the second half.”
Gaines, who has been Albany's top
performer all season. agreed that
the game was won on defense. "We
had a couple of steals. and that just
got us going. The defense turned it
around into offense — we con-
verted on the steals." sriid Gaines.

ABC Coach George Morgan felt
‘tliat Albany's depth was the key to
the game. "We don't Iiave the
bench. We came down the stretch
tired. We didn‘t get any scoring
front otir bench." said Morgan. In-
deed. only four ()wis scored
(Brown, l’aul. Bousa and Yard-
brougii). These four also scored 110
of 113 points in ABC's previous
game. “The momentum just chang-
ed. We were reuliy hot the first half.
That was probably the best half we
had till ycar." Morgan commented
freely on the game. “They (Albany)
were fresh down the stretch. and we
were tired. That was the dif-
ferencc."

llousa. the strong forward who
was also ABC‘s top scorer (24
points), felt that emotion was the
key factor. “They just came out up
to play, ﬁnd we weren'l." snid
llotisa.

Albany head coach Steve Kopp
stiipi‘isiiigiy had little to say about
his team‘s emotional victory. “I‘m
very glad that we came i)ilt.‘i\ and
played so well in the second half.

Defense got its hack in it. They were .

good. They were the best team
we‘ve played llii year." said Kopp.

Statistically. this game was
Alhtiiiy’s most impressive. 1?ch riicii
wcie iii dotiblc figures in scoring,
with four of them hitting seasonal
high. It was (iiiiiics' third gittiie
with 20 or more points. lint the big-

gest surprise was the sudden offen-
sive outburst by Ranney (who had
only five points all season before
Saturday). The guard's new-found
scoring touch, if it is for real, can
prove to be a great asset and aid the
team while Dave Hardy remains out
with a shoulder injury. Ratiney's
philosophy is simple. He said,
"That's the only thing you can do
against those big men." said the
5-10 freshman. “Go to the hoop
and get a foul."

Gaines. the on-the-court
spokesman for Albany, felt the vic-
tory was mainly ti mixture of a lot
of things. “The fans, the team — it
was a total team effort." Gaines
said. “Everyone got psyched up
and we just put it to them."

The Danes take their winning
streak on the rotid for their next
game Tuesday afternoon against
undefeated Army at West Point.

polntment. They were the second
worst team we've faced and we
should have won. Although we
were tired from the long ride — it
was a combination of problems,"
said Blngham. '

Despite the lopsided defeat. there
were some bright spots for Albany's
women. Carol Lim swam to her
best time while winning the 50 yard
breaststroke event in 37.3 seconds.
Diver Joan Meickleham copped
both the one-meter required and
optional diving competitions.
Sprinter Ann Hoch triumphed in
the 50 yard butterﬂy despite a poor
time of 31.6 seconds. The team of
Donna Starace, Donna Feitz. Hoch
and Meickleham took the 200
freestyle relay to round out
Albany's ﬁrst place ﬁnishes.

No excuses were necessary versus
Potsdam.

"Potsdam just outclassed us ——
you can't knock good competi-
tion,” noted Bingham.

Bingham expcts a close meet with
a young RPI squad on Wednesday,
saying. “With a little luck we'll
squeeze by."

Despite a 1-6 record on the
season and their current slump,
Bingham feels there have been some
bright spots in the season to date.
'_'I feel good about the team. The
times have been improving steadily,
we're just missing one or two more
strong swimmers to get over the
top." commented the first year
coach.

Distraught by the outside
pressures placed on her team by
ﬁnal exams, poor health. and a
murderous schedule. Bingham
understated the situation.
"Weekends like this on the road are
not good."
