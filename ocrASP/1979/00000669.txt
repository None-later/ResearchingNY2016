Al Stockholm had reason to
believe that this time. things would
be different. His Cortland basket-
ball squad entered Albany's Univer-
sity Gym sporting a4-0 record — an
unusuallv solid start front a
traditionally mediocre outfit. And
despite the Red Dragons“ dismal
history against Albany — rtine con-
secutive losses dating back to I970.
perhaps for the first time the Cor-
tland players believed they could
upset the Danes on their own cottrl.

So rnttch for belief.

The Red Dragons showed they
were air improved club Saturday
night. bttl the Danes were rtot easily
impressed. After coasting to a 20
point lead in the second half.
Albany held on while Cortland
came on. and the Danes managed to
push their mark to 4-0 by defeating
the Red Dragons. 65-61.

“We hung in real nice." said
Albany cettter Kelvin Jones. “They
were about the best team that will
come into our gym in the first trait
of the season. and wlten we were up
by 20. Doc (Dane basketball coach
Dick Saucrs) kept telling us 'they're
rtot out of it.‘ i think ottr experiertee
pulled trs through.“

Poor shooting and foul trouble
tnt't Cnrtlund with n 39-28 deficit at
halftime. and after an Albany spurt
early itt the second half. the
Dragons seemed ready to roll over
and take their first loss of the
season back to Cortland with thetn.
Winston Royal’s pinpoint pass to
forward John Delosa underneath
llte basket allowed Dclosa art urt-
contestcd two points arid capped a

13-4 burst that gave the Danes a
comfortable 52-32 lead.

The big lead became unconfor-
table in a hurry. The Dragons
displayed a l7-6 streak of their own
and plowed back into the ballgattte,
and leading the way for Cortland
was Thomas Baez. who sat on the
bench for the final l2:28 of the first
half saddled with three personal
fouls. A super-quick 5-ll guard.
Baez. cartned a jumper. hit on a
flaslty drive. and then followed with
a spinning. twisting layup to bring
his team within striking distance.

"Baez got more relaxed at the
ettd of the game. and it showed."
said Saucrs. “it was nice to have
him irt fottl trouble early."

After guard Rob Clune sank his
rtinth artd tcrttlt conscetttive foul
shots. the Albany margin was back
up to tea at 63-53 with 2:50 remain-
irtg irt the game. Baez immediately
countered with an offensive rc—
hound basket. arid guard Jerry
Power’s jttmpshot cut the Dane
lead to six points with l:31 left.

Albany was then in a position to pttt
the game under wraps from the foul
lirte. bttt were not able to do so.
Clune missed on his next two at-
tempts. and after Baez’s errant
jumper was hauled down by Ray
Cesare. the Dane forward also
could not hit on his free throw. Still
gunning. litter scored on a fade-
nwrty jttrttpsltot to brittg Cortland
closer at 63-59. btrt Cltrne found
Jones alone inside. arid the half-
cottrt pass was ttrrned ittto .loncs’
13th and 14th points. attd finally
tttrrtcd back the Dragon comeback.

“That was obviottsly a big play

when Clune found Kelvin." Sauers
said. “Cortland was a good team.
and at the end they showed what
they could do."

in improving their SUNYAC
record to 20, Albany relied on hot
shooting to build their lead ill the
first half. With Royal being guard-
ed by Nick Whartorr. the 5-9 Dane
captain had the rare occasiort ofgo-
ing against someone whom he could
look down to. Wharton is listed
at 5-8. 130 lbs.. bttt completely
stretched out. he stands closer to
5-5. artd is undoubtedly the smallest
player in the conference. Despite his
quickness. Wharton could not stop
Royal‘s arching jttntpers. and no
slouch when it comes to speed
himself. Royal burrted the Dragons
for five instant points. artd added to
his total of 12 poittts was three
assists. boosting his four game total
to 23.
But while Wharton was having
trouble stopping Royal. the Danes
were busy harassing the Dragons
top scorer. forward Jim Meyer-
dlerks. Joe .lednak picked up three
first half fouls. and eventually forti-
ed out with 5:42 remaining. artd left
the job of containing Mcyerdierks
to Steve Low. who pttt ill 27
minutes of solid defense. forcing
Meyerdicrks into a five-for-seven
sltooting performance and just 12
points to go with his game-high tt
rebounds. Low corttplerncntcd his
defcrtsivc effort by hitting two of
his tltrce shots artd finished with
seven poittts.

"They Were very effective stopp-
irtg Mcyerdierks.” said ('ortlund‘s

J. V. Cagers Slip Past A.B.'C. In Overtime Thriller

by Bob Bellaflore

The Albany State men’s .l.V.
basketball team came back front a
47-33 halftime deﬁcit to notclt art
emotional, action-packed 90-85
overtime victory against Albany
Business College Saturday night at
University Gym. The win increased
their record to 4-0.

“It was an overall team effort.“
said Dattc captairt Rick Cornell (ll
points). “We knew what we had to
do in the last five minutes — tough
defense. We defirtitely had the
momentum in overtime. We cante
back, and it just carried over into
overtime."

The first half was a tightly played
one. with excellent outside shooting
by botlt sides. The Owls gained the
lead at 22-20 on a four foot banker
by forward Rick Bousa with “:35
left lit the first half, and held it until
there was 0:11 remaining irt the
game when guard Mike Gaines (24

points) hit a soft one-handcr from
18 feet to lie the contest at 77. artd
sent it into overtime.

Early on the Danes seemed a bit
intimidated by the muclt larger
Owls. A few blocked shots by
center Travis Yardbrotrgh and some
nice offensive play by the burly
center were keys to the visitors’ i4
point halftime lead. Cornell. whose
job was to guard the Owl big man,
considered_shuttlng him down a big

factor in the Dartc comeback. “We
had to collapse on the middle when
the ball was on the other side. If
tltcy wouldn't get the ball inside.
the guards would just dribble the
hall outside." said the captain. This
enabled the Albany guards to per-
form their assigncd defensive task
of keeping ABC‘s sharp-shooting
guard Steve Patti (22 points) on the
pcrituetcr and prevcttt hint front
driving the latte.

Dane guard llriatt Rattncy (16
points) considered the ineffective
first half a prodtrct of Albany‘s
failure to stick by their owrt game
plan. “We played their game in the
first half. We were trying to force
their guard outside. 1 think we did a
better job irt the second half.“ com-
rnertted Rartrtcy.

Gaines thought that it was just as
rtrttclt a learn effort that engineered
the comeback as it was a team lack
of effort that almost let the game
get out of hand. “We were giving
them the jump shot and weren't
boxing out. They were getting two
or three shots. We were letting them
drive the middle too much." eon-
tinucd Gaines. “We were messing
up and they were excelling. Notltlrtg
was going right." '

Things turned around right front
the second half tip-off. Albany ran
offa 16-8 binge in the opening 6:35.
but the Owls maintained a comfor-

table ten-point cushion. artd control
of the game. Momentum shifted
when. with only three mirrtttes left
irt regulation tinte. the hustling
Ranney. who had an excellent

defensive game despite fouling out. -

forced a jttrnp ball with the Danes
down 73-65. From then on, it was
Albany who dominated. Off the
tap. Ray Edwards missed a shot.
bttt Mike (‘tatto was there on the
follow. Gallo. who had to points
on the night. then stole the ball and
fed Gaines on the break to pull
Albany to within four. Ranney's
fiftlt personal sent him to the bench
and Owl gttard Patti to tire line for a
one-and-one situation. Both were
good. and ABC was up 75-69 with
only l:57 remaining.

After a jump ball (the result of a
gutsy defertsivc play by Cornell). a
Glen Phillips jtrrttper from the
right. and a Gaines steal combined
for fottr quick points cutting ABC’s
lead to two. Owl forward Jim
Brown tltcrt ltit front inside to make
it 77-73. Gatto tltett rttade another
fine pass to the open Corttell
underneath and. with only 22
seconds left, came the major ABC
blunder. A tight Dane fttll court
press prevented guard Mike Nissen
frortr irtboundittg the ball. He failed
to call time-out. and the Owls had
to forfeit the ball with 18 ticks left

follow-up visit to Cornell. where
she investigated its emergcttcy

“Cornell has 28 crttergency

said Fine. Their function is to pro-

“When it receiver is lifted. a

“The Public Safety Department
