“If You Like Pina Coladas”

LOS ANGELES (AP) Pina coladas
are just fine by Rupert Holmes. but
they really had little to do with the
song that's put him on the pop
music map.

"Escape" —— better known as
“The Pina Colada Song" —- is one
of those tunes that come along now
and then. catch the fancy of almost
all who hear it. and skyrocket up
the record charts faster than the
proverbial speeding bullet.

Brit the happy little parable of
romantic rediscovery via the
classified ads owes less to tropical
fruit drinks and newspapers than it
does to art encounter with an
unknown male pedestrian who gave
Holmes' girlfriend the eye on a New
York city street.

it was a moment of recognition.
one of many the songwriter has im-
mortalized in his casy-on-the-

“One day l was walking down
the street with a lady friend. and we
were not getting along that day. i
started looking at the other people
on the street. mainly of the female
gender.

“And I started thinking. ‘This
relationship is not working out. i
just can't take this  She just
doesn’t do it for me any riiore. it’s v
not as exciting its it ttscd to be. It's
lost a lot of the magic.’

“And a guy's coming the other
way. and i swear to you. he bumped
into another guy because he's look-
ing so hard at the lady that l'iii

"So that was the beginning.
Then. i had to find a way to tell the
story. And it wasn't working out as
a song about people bumping into
each other in the streets. it wasn't
interesting enough.

“So later on. l'in feeling much

“And I saw one that looked like I
had typed it myself. as my ultimate
