I. Physical Army Sauad Hands J. V. First S‘le'tbacfle ‘

by Bob Bellal‘lore

The Albany State- men's .l.V.
basketball team had their four-
game winning streak snapped by
Army Tuesday at West Point, as the
Danes lost 81-61 in their first road
game. Albany now takes a 4-I
record into the holiday break. _

Albany J.V. basketball head
coach Steve Kopp cited a number of

 

reasons leading to the defeat. but
they all boil down to the fact that
the Danes were plainly outmanned
by the physical Cadets. “They had
'a couple of inches on most of our
men. and 20 pounds or so," said
Kopp. “They were in better
shape." Superior conditioning goes
without saying whenever West
‘Point is involved, altd Tuesday's

game was no exception. as the
Cadets employed a full court man-
to-man press the entire game, using
|2 players in the process. "They
were in better shape," continued
Kopp. “it were us down at the end.
The pressure bothered us, and we
didn‘t handle it very well. They play
good man-to-man defense," said
Kopp, commenting on Army‘s
defensive strategy. Indeed. the tight
coverage reaped rewards for the
Cadets, as Albany was guilty of

committing 26 turnovers (a season

high). The press affected everyone,
as Mike Gaines. the usually steady

'guard, coughed up the ball eight

times. _

Army's tough defense cut off the
Danes scorers also, as Gaines (20.25
points per game) was held well
under his average. netting only l3
points. Ray Edwards was the only
other Danes in double figures with
teri points. Oil the other hand, the
Cadets had three men in that
category, with one malt being
credited with 28 points, and another
with 20.

, Another element that worked
against Albany was Army's height.
Against the squad that Haunted
players ranging from 6-2 to 6-6, the
Dane frontcouruncn were no match
for their hosts underneath. “They
killed us off the boards, especially
in the second half," stiid Kopp. Ac-
cording to Albany captain Rick

Cornell, Army's stocky forwards

"wore us down inside." Mitch ol

that domination under the boards
resulted in Cadet buckets, as Kopp
contended that most of Army‘s
points came from inside 'or, as he
put it, eight feet or closer.

Albany was down by only five
points at the half (JG-3|). and were
trailing by a mere three with five
minutes remaining, but the Cadets
then pulled away. That was the
scheme of the game as, according to
Cornell, the Danes would get within
a few points. and then A‘rmy would
stretch the lead back to ten or so.
“We were in the game for most of
it," said Cornell. He added that Ar-
my converted oti three three-point
plays in the last minute. and that
the game was really closer.

I,

Kopp singled out guard Brian
Ranney as playing well defensively
despite fouling out for the second
time this season. The coach said
that Greg Watson also did a good
job coming off the bench.

“This was our ﬁrst road game.
which l'think bothered us. They're'
better than any team we’ve played
this year," concluded ' Koppw"!
realize that we're not going to plat
well all the time, and we just didl.
play well. We tried hard, but we
just didn't play a good game."

The .l.V. Danes can now relax
until January _ l5. when the
