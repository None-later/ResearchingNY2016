by Paul Schwartz

Buffalo has _not been the
friendliest of places for the Albany
State basketball team over the past
years. ln fact. the Danes have
traveled to face the University of
Buffalo squad numerous times. and
have never come back With a vietorv
But after combining' pressure
defense and patient offense. Albany
remained undefeated by knocking
off the Bulls Tuesday night. 66-58.

“This is the first time we‘ve ever
beaten thent iii Buffalo. and Pat
very proud that this team was the
one to do it," said Albany State
basketball coach Dick Sauers. “The
difference was defense — we did a
superb job. And iii the seeortd half.
we kept our poise and moved the
ball well."

It was two moves by Saucrs that
aided in the Danes improving their
record to 5-0. their best start sitrce
the. l975 catiipaign. After l’cte
Stanish‘s desperation shot at tlte
halftime bur/er fell through the
basket. the Danes owned a 37-33
lead. and a l()-3 spurt early iii the sc-
cottd half puslted the Albain ad«
vantage to. 47-36. At that point.

Willi l4 minutes remaining iii tlte
coritcst. it was Buffalo‘s turn to go
to a [one dcfctisr, which the Danes
simply refused to attack. and cling-
ing to a 4740 lead. Albany was con-
lcnt to hold the hall. For three
minutes. Winston Royal. Rob
Clune. and Ray Cesare took turtts
controliiig the ball outside the Bulls
l—2-2 zone. and the stall paid
dividends when Royal canned a
long jumper to boost the Dane
margin to itiiie.

“We were seven poiitts ahead.
and at first i called for a senti—
stall." Sauers said. “Brit they were
still staying in tight, and with the
time on our side, we weren‘t going

to penetrate their zone. We didn't
have one turnover during the three
minutes. and we even improved oti
our lead."

Royal finished tied with Cesare
for Albany scoring honors with [4.
points. and Royal also added five
rebounds and six assists. A balanc—
ed attaek had forwards Joe Jednak
and Steve Low botlt hit for ten
points. ‘

But it was on the defensive etid

where the Danes captured their fifth
victory arid knocked Buffalo‘s
mark to 3-3. The Bulls were lititilcd
to 46 shots. arid were forced into 23
turnovers. The Buffalo frortt litre
accounted for 44 of the Bulls 58
