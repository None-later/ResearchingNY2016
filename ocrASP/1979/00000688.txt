Dhcon’ 5 Top Ten

The Return Of Fonda

by Mark Rooster

if Faye Dunaway's comeback seems more
striking than Jane Fonda's. it's only because
Dunaway was so completely out of the
limelight. Between roughly 1972 and 1976
Fonda was getting more than her share of
publicity. she )ust wasn't getting any work. The
coverage of her anti-war activities and her trip
to Hanoi sent her box office popularity spiral-
ing and got her virtually blacklisted. it's ironic
because she won her first Oscar (for Klute) in

1971, but after that.nothlng. She continued to

fight the war. working only occasionally in
small unimportant films; for those four years
she basically had no career in movies. Then
came 1977 and for Fonda everything began to
change.

Her grandslam was Just as brilliant as
Dunaway's. but Fonda mixed commerical and
critical success and came up with two Oscar
nominations in the past two years (aird she's
almost certain to be nominated again this
year). Like Dunaway. Fonda made it back to
the top on sheer talent, but where as
Dunaway's streak has momentarily subsided
Fonda's is going stronger than ever and each
new role brings her even more acclaim. Fun
With Dick and Jane. Julio. Coming Home.
Comes a Horseman. Culi/ornia Suite. and
The China Syndrome (surely the most im-
pressive list of credits for the last half of the
decade) each showed new facets of her
boundless talent and l'm sure the Christmas
release of The Electric Horseman will continue
the trend. Fonda had been the only performer
of the last half of the decade who's work has

been of a consistently high caliber.

She is also one of the few women who has
been able to make the transfer from sex kitten
to serious actress. From her first in 1960's Tall
Story up until They Shoot Horses. Don 't they?
(her first Academy Award nomination in
1969) she played variations of the same co-
quettish flirt who was more talk than action. A
large part of that phase she now says. was a
rebellion against her faintly and part was due
to the fact that she married Roger Vadim and
consequently starred in many of his films. like
Barbarella (1968). Her work recently.
however has more than erased the image of
those early years. it's hard to write about Fon-
da because she has gotten so much praise;
one runs the risk of being boring or simply
reiterating what has already been said. it has
however become fashionable in some circles
to pick favorite Fonda roles; so here goes. i
think that Julia still remains her best overall
performance. but the last scene of China Syn-

drome has to be her finest moment,it is one of
the most incredible pieces of acting i've ever
seen.

50 no one accuses me of copping or
mention Fonda's politics only long enough to
say i refuse to mention them. They are her
concern and if we start judging performers
based on their politics (either way) we're
bound to get into trouble. All i care about is
what she does on that screen and people who
continually miss her work because of political

it. i will

TheMyth or The Male

by Mark Rooster

The seventies turned out to be the decade in
which women finally began to make a return
to the silver screen. While there Was a struggle
for power on the female side (with Fonda.
Keaton. and Streisand coming out the wiri-
ners) the men stayed fal.ly consistent with
Robert Redford. Jack Nicholson. Burt
Reynolds. and Clint Eastwood continuing to
dominate with occassional threats from War~
ren Beatty. Al Pacino. and Charles Bronson.
The ability of all four to stay so popular for so

Eastwood is. need i say it. the strong silent
type. Pacino and Bronson (a poor man's
Eastwood here. but not iii Europe) hit their
strides in the mid-seventies and now seem to
be slipping. Beatty has been ridliig a strong
crest since Shampoo and could well move up
into the big four. ‘
Nicholson has the most impressive track
record of the bunch with at least eleven major
international awards since 1070 (more than
any other actor) five Academy Award
nominations. and a long string of hits in»
(hiding Chinatown. Five Easy Pieces. The

box office success. Of late. Nicholson seems to
have fallen under the Oscar curse. There is a
long list of people who did wonderful work in
movies and kept racking up nominations. but
once they finally won the little golden man
they went downhill. Nicholson won four years
ago (for Cuckoo's Nest) and hasn't doiie a de-
cent thing since. but his next film Stanley
Kubrick's soon to be released The Shining
(based on Stephen King's novel) may change
all that. Nicholson may he the best actor of the
group. but Redford and Reynolds are n‘ot
without talent. Reynolds‘ huge popularity of
late should crest around Christmas with the
release of Redford's Electric .l-forseman. but he
may regain ground if he gets an Oscar

tell us. Redford is the bigger star of the two it's
because he is the movie star of the old school:
he's reclusive, there isn't a lot of publicity on
him. but more than anything elsa. he doesn't
work often so that when something of his
comes out. it becomes an event (people also
rush to see It because they know they won't be
seeing him again for two or three years).
Reynolds on the other hand. is all over all the
ttnre. He does TV specials aird talk shows.
he'll give an interview to practically anyone.
and he makes at least one movie a year. he
just doesn‘t have Redford's prestige.
E‘istwood's popularity has stayed constant
throughout the years. but his last (and best)
