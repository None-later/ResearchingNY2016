Transportation Problems Close Pittman Hall

by Sue Milllgnn and Aron Smith

Pittman Hall, SUNYA's
Loudonville supplementary housing
building, closed at the end of the
fall ‘79 semester due to
“transportation problems." accor-
ding to Director of Residences John
Welty.

A number of students prefer on-
campus housing other tltan Pittman
due to its lack of convenience.wcn.y
said. He added that "the cost of
transporting the numbers of
students who needed housing (at
Pittman) was not feasible financial-
ly.”

   

Pittman IlnII III Loudonville Closes

“The (TH! of transporting. . . was nutfcusi/Jle financially.

Welty said there were “no pro-
blcrns other than location" that led
to the decision to close Pittman.
Welty denied that October ‘79
asbestos level testing was a factor in
the decision.

Pittman residents were given on
campus housing priority for Spring
‘80. A “sufficient nutnber of
students graduated. withdrew from
the University. of left on excanges
to accommodate such students."
Wclts said.

Pittman Htill was leased to
SUNYA by the Episcopal Diocese
of Albany. As was provided for in

the contract. SUNYA cancelled the
lease with 30 days notice. According
to Welty, “the Diocese is attemp-
ting to sell the property."

According to Dealt of Student
Affairs Ncil Brown. the Diocese is
expected to sell the building to a
developer. The company is present-t
ly sekittg a zoning change befor the
City of Albany zoning and Plann-
ing Board. The developers plan to
expand the building into an apart-
ment complex. Brown said.

The Episcopal Diocese has said
the complex will probably not be
available next fall.

According to Brown. a substitute
for Pittman Hall must be found if
current enrollment figures do not
decrease itt l9BO-8l. Any action
taken by SUNY toward real estate
acquisition or- new construction will
depend upon projected enrollment
figures to be released late this
month or early in February.

Welty, ltowcvcr, claims that a
search for substitutes for the hous—
ing space offered by Pittman Hall
may be avoided if the property is re-
tained by SUNYA. In spite of the
diocese's cttrrcnt plans for transfer
of the Pittman property. Welty said
he will “reconsider” the building as
possible stttdcnt housing

However. both Brown attd Welty
are reviewing alternative tncans of
housing students requesting on-
eampus housing for whom space is
unavailable. Brown. who predicts
that between 200 atttl 300 students
will fall into this category next fall.

McCarthy's rifle jammed after
one shot was fired. According to
another officer. Doug Kern, the
assailant thcn- grappled with Gaal
before hurling the weapon through
the wirtdsheild of his patrol car
amid shards of ﬂying glass.

According to Gaal. McCarthy
had a figltt with his wife earlier that
night. In his anger he crazin “shot
up his home" which is located less
than a quarter mile from the up-
town campus. According to Gaal.
he was cutting through the campus
to get to his in-Iaws' home to kill
them.

“Officer Gaal spotted McCarthy
witltout a jacket carrying an objuct
in the wooded area between
Washington Avenue and Perimeter
road. north of State Quad. He then
used his spot light to further in-
vestigate what Ite thought might
have bcctt a stranded motorist."
said Kern. The assailant fled to a.
position behind the trees and of-
ficer Gaal continued onto
Wasltittgtou Avenue to searclt for
the assailant. At this point a sltot
was fired at officer Gaal." said
Kcrtt.

"Through laboratory analysis.
and the impact poittt on the car. it
was determined that the target of
the gunshot was officer Gaal." said
SUNYA police Assistant Director
John chighan.
