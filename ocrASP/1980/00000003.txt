According to Gilchrist, “we
have little if any idea of what they'll
(DOB) do to us. The governor is
making a lot of noise in the
newspapers." He added that
SUNYA can‘ handle some reduc-
tions. “A certain number hurts us
but it doesn't kill us."

Gilchrist~ explained that tltc
budget appropriations are divided
into two categories: salaries and
wages and “other than personal ser-

'viccs"‘ (OTPS). the latter group

representing 20 percent of
SUNYA’s total budget request.
OTPS includes such items as
utilities (such as gas and electric),
equipment (instructional, bus ser-
vice. cleaning machines), and
classroom supplies. “When we’re
eat here, that hurts," he added.
According to Spindler, a $20
million increase was required in the
1979-80 budget appropriation for
utilities SUNY—wide. Anotlter $20
million has been requested as part
of SUNY's l980-8l budget pro-

posal. This. he said, does not repre-
sent any increase in service, merely
'reflccting the effects of inﬂation.
Ward said that the period exten-
ding from I975 to the present saw
budgetary cuts of 549 faculty
members and 16,697 in non-faculty
personnel. “There is no doubt that
this trend will continue," she said.
Spindlcr stated. however. that
previously negotiated contracts
with United University Professions
(faculty) and the Civil Service
Employees Association (staff) will
probably remain unaffected in’thc
l980-8l Executive Budget.
Spindlcr explained that thc‘con-
tract figures were carried over in
SUNY's budget proposal front the
1979-80 budget. The contracts will
most likely continue to be carried
over into future budgets, until their
expirations. Because the UUP and
CSEA contracts have already been
negotiated, they are one of the least
likely targets for budgetary cuts,
said Spindler.

Gilchrist said O'Leary and
SUNYA's ﬁve vice presidents will
meet during the next two months to
determine which positions should
be climinated.He added that while
faculty may or may not be retrench-
ed, it is likely that SUNYA will ex-
perience in athletic equipment,
maintenance, and funds in vice
presidential areas.

In light of the annual budget in-
creases, Gilchrist claimed that
SUNYA has received only a i9
percent increase from I973 to
1978, while the Higher Education
Price Index states that nationwide
college costs have skyrocketed 4]
percent in those six years.‘_’ That is
one cross indicator to the costs of
higher education," he added. “We
have to eat that, and do the same
things a lot cheaper."

A statewide rally. protesting the
mandated cuts, will be held on

"The light must have blinded him
because he stood up and held the
gun over his head." he said. Gnal,
after calling for a back-up crew.

ted to restrain the assailant. "He
was ttot physically very aggressive
but he refttscd to cooperate with

me." McCarthy apparently titought .

Gaal was after him because of his
shooting spree. According to Gaul
McCarthy implied. “If I could kill
you it would give me there titne to
get away."

McCarthy then threw the rifle

through the windshield of Ctaal‘s
ear. Thei'officer was able to subdue
McCarthy until other officers arriv-
ed.

McCarthy is a veteran with an ex—
cellent tuilitary record. The rifle. his
private property, was a sporting
model which does not require a
New York State registration, said
SUNYA police officer Gary
O’Connor.

McCarthy is presently under

ing charged with second degree at-

ing crunch at least to the extent of
replacing Pittman Hall.

Brown is considcring rc-applying
for a Federal Department of Hous-
ing artd Urban Development (HUD)
loan to build art on-campus apart-
ment complex. Last fall SUNYA‘
was denied the $5 ntillion loan that
would have funded an eight—
building. two-story complex with a
housing capacity of 440 students.
Brown poittlcd out, however, that
the complex would take at least one
year to construct.

Brown may request a change in
the SUNY i980-8i Executive
Budget proposal to provide for ad-
ditional housing funds.

The building is within walking
distance of the downtown SUNYA
campus and the SUNY and CDTA
buslines. Brown estimates the
warehouse bttildittg could be con-
verted to 50-60 apartments, housing
74-90 students.

In addition. Brown said that “the
(Pine Hills) Neighborhood Associa-
tion and improvement association
should be very rnuclt interested in
having it renovated for the use of
University students."

Ilrown stated that although the
Lake Street httildiug could replace
Pittman and hold more students,
“it would nol resolve the housing
shortage."

“There may be some other op-
tions," he said. “There's no doubt
that the doubling RA's roonts and
the tripling of a few other rooms.
are possible options."
