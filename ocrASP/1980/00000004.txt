Tusk on'Tube

Fleetwood Mac will begin
negotiating early ttcxt year with tlte
major television networks for the
broadcast rights to a onc hour TV
special produced by tile grottp.

During the past year. two
separate tnovic crcws filmed the
band dttring rccording sessions for
their newest album, “Tusk,” and
dttrittg two of the concerts on their
current U.S. tour.

Mick Flectwood, the group's
drummer and business manager. is

some news

currently supervising the final
editing of the proposed TV special,
and reportedly has total control
over its final contents.

Flcctwood Mac hopes to offer the
special to cable TV systems around
the U.S. and Canada after an initial
airing by a major network. The
group is also cortsidcrittg offering
the show for home viewing on video
cassettes and video discs.

Political

A nationwide poll of American
women has found that there is vir-
tually no difference in the sexual
practices of Democrats and
Republicans, or conservatives,
liberals attd radicals.

The political newsletter The

However, the pollsters rcportcdly

Human mnlcs may soon be unneed-
ed for the purposes of reproduction

A researcher at Vanderbilt
University claims that lie has suc-
cessfully completed the first step in
fertilizing a mouse egg without us-
ing sperm front a tnalc.

Pierre Soupart says that his ex-
perimcttts mark the first time that
this process, known as
“Parthenogencsis.” has been
achieved in a mammal.

Soupart says be combined two
unfertilized mouse eggs by a start-

_.t

  

 

dard ccllﬂfusion technique, and that
he achieved a cell with the same
chromosome count as a sperm-
fertilized egg.

The researchervsays the next step
will be to transfer the all-female cm-
bryos he has produced to mouse
foster-mothers to determine if nor-
mal development will continue.

Incendiary Bats

VA I959 Armed Forces publication
reveals that, during World War
Two, the Army and the Navy at-
tempted to turn bats into incendiary
weapons —— in experiments that fail-
cd badly.

According to the Armed Forces
Chemical Journal. Harvard Univer-
sity researchers, working under a
Pentagon grant, used surgical
methods to attach small firc~bombs
to the bodies of trained hats.

The hope was that the bats could
be dropped from airplanes over
Japan, that they would find dark
buildings in which to settle. and
that they would chew off their fin.-
bombs that would soott explode and
cause fires.

The Journal notes, hovvcver, that
the first ﬁeld tests were a disaster
for the Pentagon. A trial rtttt with
the wired bats was supposed to ltlke
place near Carlsbad Cuvet its Ill New
Mexico, bttt sotttcthing went wrong.
A number of the bats reportedly
escaped and set off a series of ne—
cidcntul fires. When the smoke had
cleared, it gcnct'ul's cm had been
burned to the ground and u $2
tnilliott (dollut') airplane hangar
demolished by flames.

The Journal says that the Navy
then stepped ill and decided to try
to salvage the plan by determining
if the buts could be artificially cool-
ed and forced to hibernate. It was
hoped this would stop them from
escaping ttnd tltut the buts would
revive wltilc being dropped over
their intended targets.

However, Nttvy documents in
dicttte that when the cooled buts
were dropped front n plane — itt the
words of the Now A “most slept
on." Wltnt happened is that the)
fell to their deaths on the ground.
After these setbacks, the but project
was abandoned by the Pentagon.

t Doesn’t Matter

A new scientific theory, which is
to be tested shortly, suggests tltttt ltII
mutter itt the universe ~ every lust
utom w will eventually disappear.

If the theory is correct, one day
there will be nothing |cft...notlting.

7710va York Times reports that
lending tltcorcticul physi sts in the
Unich States and abroad are begin—
ning to suspect that the very
building blocks of atoms — the pro-
teins uttd neutrons ~ are slowly
breaking down and disappearing
over lottg periods of time.

To test this theory. the U.S.
Department of Energy is funding at
$2 tttilliott (dollar) experiment to set:
if the disintegration of atomic pur-
ticlcs can be observed iii a cavern of
water undér Lake Eric.

H the theory is correct. how
much titnc do we have left? Accor.
ding to The 'l‘inu's, the last bit of
matter should vanish for good in
about 10,000 billion billion billion
years.
