That's right, there are four other boroughs and the rest of
 the Empire state, as well as other states and countries and
continents. Geographically Manhattan island is a spec, a
dot on a map, to the enormity of the rest. But when you

grime and crime, conjestecl. Like pepperoni, New York is
hot, spicy. and hard to swallow. You either love it or hate
it, but you must react to it.
