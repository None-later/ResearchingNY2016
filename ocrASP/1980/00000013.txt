After a layoff of more than a
month, and with less than six prac-
tice days, the Albany State men's
J.V basketball team won their ﬁrst
two contests of the new year.
beating Hamilton College Tuesday
night 70-63, and then demolishing
ncarhy College of St. Rose last
night 106-73, both at University
Gym. Dave Hardy. returning front
a shoulder injury, was top Dane
scorer in both games. with 2t points
’l‘ues’day. and 24 points last night.
Albany‘s record is now 6-].

Last night. Albany went ahead

, for good early on, and. in the se—

cond ltall. CSR never got closer
tltan I], with the margin of victory
beirtg the biggest Dane lead.

the Albany players were itr dott-

rebounds." The running game was
important. at CSR was weary in the
ﬁnal half. Offensive play improved
vastly from Tuesday's rusty perfor-
mance. as Albany clicked for the
high score of the season.

Tuesday,
characterized both sides. as an ex-
cessive amount of passes were either
thrown out of bounds or into the
arms of opponents. Four turnovers
were committed before the ﬁrst 90
seconds ticked off the clock, and
there wasn't a bucket until albany
guard Greg Watson put one in front
close after 2:30. The Danes had
worked the lead up to 13 points
(24-ll) with 7:00 remaining in the
first bald. but the Continentals rip-
ped off a 10-0 spree in the next three
minutes. and outscored Albany
Ill-5 to knot the match by half-time
at 29-29.

The remainder ol~ the game was
basically uneventful, as the learns
player! morc»or‘less run and gun,
exchanging offensive foul—ups as
well as baskets. Albany got the lead
on a Mike (intro (2!) points, 6 often-
sive rebounds) free throw, and
never relinquished it. Although the
Danes were up by nine points on

sloppy offense '

three occasions. they almost gave
the ballgame away near the end as
Albany failed to hit on any of nine
one-on-one foul situations in the

'ﬁnal three minutes. enabling the

tenacious visitors to close the gap.
Albany head J.V. basketball
coach Steve Kopp cited several
reasons for his squad’s sloppy play.
including the long layoff and the
fact that, in the four days of prac-
tice, the learn was down to eight or
nine men due to health reasons and
was inable to run a full-court scrim-
mage. Nonetheless. he was pleased
with the game. “It's nice to get that
type of play out of our system,"

said Kopp. "
Defense was the key. as a tight
Albany zone. although allowing
sharpslrooting Hamilton guard Bob

Becker and 'l‘om Lehy. and
sophomore (ieue Sosiak.

liar‘l described tltis shortage of
experience: “We don‘t have
everyone we planned on. Willi only
six returning starters. we'll be thin
on experience. especially on the
bench.“

Perhaps a partial ansch to this

problem will be junior Deven'

l.ock|ey. A transfer from a eltrb
tcanr in Syracuse. lockley may fill
part of the void left by last season‘s
losses. ()lhet‘ titan the addition of
Locklcy. however, the learn is as
tiarl says. wide open.

The schedule though. seems
favorable for the young learn. With
the exception of the opening match
against Cortland on February 2nd.
Albany is not slated to olav within
its own division until March. Play-
ing those early league matches pro-
vides a firte developmental period irt
preparation for the more com-
petitive intradivision nurtcltes later
iii the season.

“The big question now is for the
learn to absorb and gain experience
and poise." liarl said.

'l‘ypit‘ying the team‘s young
otrtlook is the team's most impor-
tant addition, new assistant coach
.larnic Mclr‘arland. McFarland, a
former national learn player, was
on the Danes' l'ir'sl club team a few
years ago. liar'l rated his new assis-
tarrl as invaluable to the rapid
development of the learn.

After the ('ortland match, the
Danes trach to Vassar on the llllr.
Because of llte apparent lack of c.\‘-
per'ienee, lzarl requests that any ex-
perienced volleyball players contact
him irrtnrediately.
