Los .ANGELES (AP) '«uow do

says Dave Elmendorf. ‘fYou do it
with a Pat Thomas and a Rod
Perry." That may well be the most
critical matchup in Sunday’s Super
Bowl game,~ with Thomas and
Perry. the Los Angeles Rams' cor-
nerbacks. trying to muzzle the Pitt-
sburgh Steelers' terrifying tandem
of deep threats.

, Hamilton chipped away at the
Dane lead by errrploying a 1-3-1 trap
defense which forced Albany itrto
II turnovers in the second half.
Grimmer cut the deficit to 10 witIr a
lay in. followed immediately by a
steal and another easy hoop by the
Conlincntal‘s’“.center. After
giveaways by guards Rob Clinic and
Winston Royal. who hail an off
night. with no field goals and jrisl
four points. Hamilton's Frank (iar-
eiii hit one free throw. Robinson
made a tremendous block on a
Stanish drive. and Ron Ijvtirrs' two
fortl shots cirt the Albany lead to
64—59 with 1:40 remaining.

“1 was disappointed that we let
that nice leatl get away." said
Sauers. “Part of it wits due to
srnarl. aggressive play by Hamilton.
birt we didn't handle their pressure
as well as I thought we would."

"1 don't think we played very
well." added Hamilton coach Tom
Murphy. “We had too many titr-
trovers. l think when l look at the
charts I'll be sick. livery time wr
needed a basket we turned the ball
over. llut we came back iii the last
two and one half mirnrtes ot‘ the
game. arid that was encouraging."

After a timeout with 122‘) left. the
Danes piil Hamilton olit of reach.
as Royal’s halfeoiirt pass found
Stanish alone for a lay up. Jones
scored on his jarrr. and .chnak and
Stanish hit free throws. livans’ un-

the contest actually was.

“We are a yoitng team. and we
will be better." Murphy corn
mcntcd. "lhit it woirld hirve been
nice to get a win over a good club.
and these guys are a good club."

With seven underclassmcn on
their roster. Hamilton is a learn of
the fiitirrc. while the Danes, off to
their finest start in Albany history,
are looking forward to the present.
Arid Jones. who received a standing
ovation after his think and again

“But no other team has two cor-
nerbacks that are as capable as
ours," Elmendorf. the Rams’
strong safety. said Wednesday

. before the team began what Coach

Ray Malavasi described as Its two
hardest days of workouts.

“When you’ve got guys who are
as capable as Rod and Pat and
you're matching them up against
Stallworth and Swann, you've got
two natural battles there — and 1
think that in the past we've won the

battles." said Elmendorf. reflecting

on the Rams’ 10-7 victor over

       

Steelers during the 1978 season. In
that game. .Pittsburgh's two wide
receivers were limited to just 69
yards on five receptions.

"We'll be up in their faces just
about all day." said Thomas. who
missed half the season with a knee
injury and returned as a starter in
the Rams' 9-0 shutout of Tampa
Bay in the National Conference
championship game.

Swann's biggest asset. Thomas
said, is his concentration. "The guy
can catch a needle in the dark —— he
can catch anything.” he said. “If
the ball hits his hands. he's got it.
That doesn’t intimidate me at all —
but l think we can 'do a few things
to intimidate him . . . l think it's
my job to destroy the will of the
receiver. Swarm is a man; he's
human. And you can destroy his
