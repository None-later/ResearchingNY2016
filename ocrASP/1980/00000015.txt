Albany" Beaten In

 

Overtime Thriller

by Paul Schwartz

Y Even the build-up could not com-

pare to the 45 minutes of tense,
dramatic basketball displayed at
Albany's University Gym last
night. The two top ranked Division
111 teams in the state, number one
Potsdam vs. number two Albany.
squared off in a battle for eastern
supremacy. At the final buzzer.
Potsdam remained on top, bttt just
barely. edgittg the Danes 70-68 in
overtime.

Potsdam, the third ranked Divi-
sion “1 team in tire nation. iinprov‘
ed their unblemished record to 11-0,
and overcame the jinx that
Albany’s home court had on them.

In gairiitig their first-ever victory in .

University Gym. the Bears also
broke the Duties 1‘) game liotne win-
ning streak. handed Albany their
first SUNYAC loss of the season.
and dropped the Danes record to
10-2.

“We were fortunate to win."
said Potsdam coach .lcrry Welsh.
“We were also fortunate to only be
three points down at the half.
because Albany completely
outplayed us. Albany’s got a great
team arid a great eoaelt. and it’s
tought to beat them anywhere — on
their court or ours. it was an impor-
tant win for us."

Rob Clune‘s two free throws with
1:17 remaining in regulation gave

the Danes a 66—64 lead. but Scott ‘

Franko‘s .short jumper just 12
seconds later. brought Potsdam
even. Albany held for the last shot.
but Clune's side jumpshot with four
seconds left was short, and bounced
just off the rim.

Potsdam's Derrick Rowland
fouled Dane center Kelvin Jones
with four minutes left in the over-
time period, and Jones connected
on two pressure-packed free throws
to give Albany is 68-66 lead.
Rowland's one handed dunk tied
the score at 68-68, and the Danes
took control with 3:30 remaining.

Albany coach Dick Sauers in-
structed his squad to stall for the
‘last shot. but after running all but
13 seconds off the clock. Dane for-
ward Pete Stanish drove-to the
basket, was fouled, and stepped to
the foul line. Stanish missed the free
throw, though. arid Potsdam hur-
ricd the ball upcourt. With four
seconds left, Bear forward Maurice
Woods connected on a short
jumper to give Potsdam the lead.
70-68. After two Albany time outs.
Stanish‘s inbounds parts was stolen
by guard Ed Jacliiin, and tire
Potsdam celebration begatt.

“We had our chance." Saucrs
said. “if we hit that last sltol iii
regulation. we witt the gariie. Clune
got a good shot off. in overtime. we
were trying to play for the last sltot.
Stitnish made his nioveJoo soon.
lint l‘rn riot displeased with ottr cf-
furt. it was as good a basketball
game its yott could see."

Woods and Rowland shitrcd high
scoring honors with 22 points each,
while Dane guard Winston Royal
hit tor tit points, 14 in the first half.

Albany Tops In Capital District

in the past. the scheduled games
over the holiday break have not
always been the kindest of friends
to the Danes. But this season. the
Albany State basketball team tnet
with nothing but success. starting
off the new decade by winning the
Capital District ’l’ourriamctit, and
then defeating RPI. The three vic-
tories boosted the sttprising Danes
record to 9-1. their best start since
1958. ,.

Witlt a number of changes frortt
last year's squad, Albany basketball
coach Dick Saitcrs figured his tcatii
would need lirric to gel together.
.This has not been necessary,
tltotiglr. and even Stiners ditl not cs»
pcct such a quick start.

“l‘m very surprised." Sitticis
said. "i looked at otir schedule ——
ttt llic learns we had to play. and l
couldn't see ltow we would be 9-1 at
this point, lint this team ltiis sur.
prised inc. and they are still surpris-
itrg me. Actually. iii our first 1t'11
games. we didn't have it good
shooting night once. llut we‘ve
shown poise. cxpccittlly at the curl
of yttltlcs.”

Albany successfully delctrdctl

their Capital District title by
edging Union on January 5th,
57-55 and downing Tufts 82-71.,
The first round niatcltup turned our
to be a traditional Albany-Union
grime —— close, low scoring, and ag—
gressive defense by bolli learns. The
Danes managed to take a 35-33 lead
at halftime, despite losing center
Kelvin Jones, who got into im-
mediate foul trouble and eventually
fouled out early in the second half.
Guard Winston Royal paced the
Danes Willi 16 points and five
assists. and forward Pclc Stitnish
crime of the bench to hit all five of
his shots and contributed 13 points.
lloth Albatiy players were selected
to the All-'l‘ournitmcnt team.

Royal showed why he was also
voted the tourncy's MVl’ the next
night against Tufts. shooting 9 of
14, scoring 1‘) points. and also hitti-
ding off for eigltt assists. .Ioiniirg
Royal itr double figures was Rob
(.‘liine (14 points) and Jones. who
came brick strong iii the finals with
a 10 point, to rebound perfor-
mance. l-‘orwtii'd Joe .lcdnttk led all
players with 11 rebounds.

The Ditties led Tufts 32-31 at the

trait. bttt Albatty fell behind once_
the second half began. and trailed
49-40 with 11:50 remaining in the
game. That's when the Danes got
offensive help frorii an ttiiexpectcd
source — reserve guard Bob Col-
licr. A long Collier jump shot
brought Albany within three poittts.
and their after another 18 foot
jumper. Collicr's lutskct gave tlte
Danes tltc lend. 58—57. with 7:14
left. Royal‘s steal and layup and
Joncs‘ hoop gave the Danes it four-
poiut cushion. ttrrd it late surge gave
Albany till 11 point victory.

“it was very satisfying to wiii tltc
tournament,“ commented Sttttcts.
“l tltoitglil the four learns wcrc
evctily matched. turd the other
teams established its as the favorite,
so it's nice to witt when tire pressure
is oil you."

Concerning Royal as the MVP.
Strucrs added, "I-‘or thc first .10
minutes of both games. Winston
was just another player. lint iii the
last 10 minutes of each game he was
outstanding. He made u lot of big
plays for us. and i suppose tluu was
why he was voted to be the MVP."

When he caught the ball in his

what was about to happen. “it‘s

afterwards. “When i looked up and

what was soon to occur. “i knew

Sattcrs, Albany‘s head basketball
coach. “I could see it in his eyes ——
tliere was such ititerisity iii his
eyes."

Hamilton had all but erased ll 12
point Dane lead, and was trailing
66-62 when Jones bcgati dribbling
across mideourt. At 6-6, 215 lbs..

let go a resounding. two-handed
slam dutik. bringing the large crowd
to their feet. Whelan even fouled
Jones on the play, btit the excited
Dane missed the free throw. Albany
managed to hold on though. and
turned back Hamilton. 70-68.

"There's been a lot of pressure
on me from my teammates to throw
one down," said Jones. “it’s such a
gamebreaker.”

The Danes almost broke the

. game open way before Jones did.

After leading 28-25 at halftime,
Albany took control of the contest
in the second half, and ironically.
they did it without Jones. who pick-
ed up his fourth foul with 14:50 re-
maining. and sat out for 8:23 as the
Danes boosted their lead to ten
points. Forward Steve Low replac-
ed Jones, and did a credible job
containing Hamilton’s leading
scorer. 6-6 center Kevin Grimmer.
who also was forced to sit for two
minutes with four fouls. Grimmer
finished with 25 points on 11 of 13
shooting. but many of his baskets
came on follow tips and offensive
rebounds.

After a short jumper by Charles
Robinson brought the Continentals
to within 42-40, Pete Stanish and

Danes to art 18-8 spurt and a 60—48

Student
Alugged
O n
Campus—
Pod i u m

by Sylvia Saunders

A female student was mugged on
the podittni Sunday at approximate-
ly 2:25 tt.rn.. according to Public

' Safety Department Assistant Direc-
tor lolrri l'lcnighan.

The young woman. who police
would only identify its a Cayuga
llttll resident. was reportedly walk—
ittg early Sunday morning through
the piiie trcc area between the
l~lumttnilics and Library buildings.
Apparently a man catitc tip to ltcr
and said. “Let too have all your
money." llcrtiglitui said the man
did not show her any weapon.

According to police reports, the
wortiatr told him she had no money.
htit lie took her ring and fled from
the area.

The assailant is described its ii
white male. approximately 6'3"
and 190 pounds. llc hits wavy dark
hair, a thin moustache, blue eyes
and ti trtolc on his right cheek.

l‘lcnighan sttid this is the “first
assault of this type" during the pre-
sent school year. l’olicc security
cannot be increased. he said,
“because there is no way we can ptil
it man on every square iticlr of the
campus.”

Police have no leads on the case.
btit plan 31 routine investigation.

_Reflecting both normal 5
dtture ceilings, State University's expenditures are sub-
stantially below appropriated levels. For example,
despite .an authorized level of 34,500 positions. the
Universtty actually has only 31,800 filled‘positions. The
negative lump sum that reduced SUNY's positions by
1,120 and appropriations by a gross total of $12.3 millioh
serves to bring the gap between authorizations and e\'-
penditures to a more realistic level. '

‘Allocation of the position and appropriation reduction
Will be primarily the responsibility of the Trustees of the
State University, who will prepare and submit an
allocmion plan to the Division of the Budget.

The .personnel portion of the reduction, 8 total of
approxrmately $9.7 million. is actually a net amount
which reflects the fiscal effect of abolishing 1,125
posttions, offset by significant savings relief. A substan-
tial portion of this relief will be allocated to Stony Brook
to permit the phased opening of the University Hospital.

State University Reexamination ...........-—$14,000,000

Unlike the $12,300,000 base reduction described
above which constitutes a budgetary adjustment to
make appropriations more consistent with actual expen-
diture patterns, this $14,000,000 reduction in State sup-
port is designed to encourage a fundamental re-
examination of State University's staffing levels and
funding formulas. campus missions and programs.
Federal and private sources of funds, and user fees. This
re-examination reflects the changed economy and
enrollments expected for the 1980’s. The reduction is
proportionately consistent with that imposed at City
University and will be distributed by the Trustees in
plan to be s'ubmitted to the Budget Director.

TAP Proposes Stricter Guidelines

 

  

Minimum GPA is and Credits Proposed

by Douglas Kohn
in an attempt to avoid misuse of
Tititiort Assistance Program (TAP)
funds. the State Department of
Education is proposing stricter
guidelines for governing awards.
According to present rtiles. TAP
is awarded to “full-time students iti
good academic standing." The full-
tinic student iiittst complete (pass
or fail) at least three credits his
first semester, six credits the second
semester and it minimum of twelve
crcdils for each scrttcstcr followiitg.
Credit minimum requirements
will be tighentcd, according to
Assistant Commissioner of Higher
Education. l)on Nolan. “What
we’re trying to avoid is having
students sign tip for IZcrcdits at the
beginning of tire scriicslcr. making
tlietir eligible for 'l‘Al', rhcn dropp-
itig down to six or rrirtc credits dur-
itig the semester lllltl still rccciving a
full 'l‘AP award." said Nolan.
He said. ltowcvcr. each school
would establish a review committee
that would excuse students from
dropping below the credit minimum
for extenuating ciretttiistuticcs such

as a death in the family or illness.
The committee would have the
authority to waive a penalty in the
TAP award. _

The "good acadetnic standing"
clause is presently defined by the
student‘s particular institution.
Nolan said that “many schools
define good academic standing as
nothing more than being etirollcd in
the school."

Nolan sttitl the proposed revisions
would direct the school to have
strict guidelines including it
minimum grade poittt average and
a certain credit tnirtitntttn per
\L‘lllt'h'lcl‘.

" the minimum grade point
average is aimed to make sure llte
student is making satisfactory pro-
gress and showing a certain amount
of ct'fort."Noliinsaid.

“TAP costs the taxpayers $250
million last year and we want to

make sure it‘s going towards help-i

itig students get soriicwhere." he
added.

Dr. James Purdue, Vice
(‘lianccllor of Academic Programs
Policy Planning for ‘ .N
agreed that "there are abuses to be
cleared tip." bttt said "they could
be handled with a lot less legisla-
tion.

lie is opposed to provisions that
would exclude TAP support for
electives leading to teacher certifica-
tion and progruttis leading to more
than one bachelor's degree. He
labels the proposed ctits its “very
bad cduciitioti."l’crduc stated,
“the institution does have it respon-
sibility to define what it strident in
good standing is." btit feels that the
changes can be made within the iri-
dividual schools.

SUNYA Financial Aid Director,
Donald Wliitlock, terrnctl tltc pro-
posals “it nightmare" arid
“impossible to administer."
Wliitlock sees the regulations as it
reaction to “a small tiurribcr tlcec~
ing the government“ and doesn't
see the ticcd for sttcli regulation in a
highly ttccrcditcd school such as
SUNYA. According to Wliitlock.

"Schools are more than willing to
