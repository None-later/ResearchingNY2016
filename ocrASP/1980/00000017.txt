New State Budget May Make Legislators Sick

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) Gov. Hugh
Carey's office declined comtnent
Monday on a report that Robert J.
Morgado, the governor's chief of
staff, was the anonymous aide
quoted in news accounts as having
said the new state budget would
make legislators “puke”.

The Buffalo News reported on
Sunday that it had learned that it

was Morgado who had made that
remark — a potentially significant
news item, since Carey has sug-
gested he might fire whoever said it.

But Charles Holcomb, the gover-
nor‘s couununications director,
said he would have no comment on
the report and that his ofﬁce had
“not been aware of it.”

Earlier this month Newsday, and

later the New York Titties. quoted
an unnamed aide to Carey as having
said that “we're going to send those
guys a budget that will make them
puke." Neither paper has named its
source.

Carey responded by sending a let-
