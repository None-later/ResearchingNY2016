Dial-an-Atheist

Now that “Dial-A-Prayer" has
been around for decades. along
comes its first challenge in tire form
of — you guessed it ~
“Dial-An-Atheist."

The Northern Illinois Chapter of
American Atheists is' offering an
around-the-clock answering service
which tries to convince callers that
there is no God.

Callers to "DiaLAn-Atheist" are
treated to a two-minute argument
on such topics as inacctrracies arid
contradictions in the new testa-
ment's account of the life of Christ.
What's more, at the end of the
message. the caller is invited to
leave his or her reaction on tape.

You cart reach “Dial- An-
Atltcist" at (3I2) 597-2433.
although the line is often busy.

Graffiti Works

(irnll'iti is good for business.

Scrawls and jokes written on
walls are a good totiic for workers.
and managers who tolerate the
scribblings rttii iiittcli happier of-
fices.

All ol' this is according to writer
Nicholas Locke. the author of it
new book titled You Wait! I! . . .
When. Locke says he came to his

 

       
 

@‘ i] 

conclusion about the beneficial ef-
fects of grafﬁti after studying the
walls of 300 campanies and govern-

inent offices and comparing the'

amount of scrawl with the morale
within those ofﬁces.

According to Locke: “Employers
who don't mind jokes about the
job. or themselves, usually have the
best industrial relations records."

Some examples of “Mentally
Healthy" graffiti? “We run a tight
ship here —- though sortie get tight a
little too often." Or "Help support
wild weekends — save your energy
front Monday to Friday.”

Beatles Trip

A San Francisco drug researcher
says that many of today's teenagers
are taking l..S.D. arid listening to
old Beatles’ records as part ol' an
adolescent "rite of passage."

Dr. David Smith. the Medicttl
Director of the Haight-Ashbtiry
Free Medical Clinic. reports that
acid is once again becoming
poptilar among the .young iii San
Francisco.

However. Smith says that the

informed about the drug and have
fewer bad trips than did the kids of
the “flower power" generation
more than a decade ago.

According to Dr. Smith, the oc-
casional use of psychedelics and the
buying of Beatles' records helps to-
day's teens in their search for what
he calls “a nostalgic culture ex-
perience: They want to individually
experience what happened in the
‘60‘s." he says. .

Smith adds that — in his words
—- “Most of today's kids know
what they are doing. and they are
taking L.S.D. as part of their
adolescent ‘ritc of passage.’ ”

Partying Plant

The Federal Drug Enforcement
Administration and other federal
agencies used a U-S steel corpora-
tiort furnace to burn part of 50 tons
ol' colombian marijuana seized on
the Texas coast last month.

U-S steel officials permitted the
drug agency to use an auxiliary ftir-
nacc to burn about 20,000 pounds
of weed. Another 15,000 pounds
will be burned in the near future.
the D-IZ-A says. '

Don duke. assistant superinten-
dent of stch production at the
plant. said that the company‘s steel
output ls low at this time of ycar
and lllttl the firm is not charging the
government for the service.

According to one US steel
employee who observed the step-by-
step binning procedure: “It has to
be done, btit it‘s enough to make a
grown mttn cry."

Machine Shrink

It had to happen sooner or later:
Psychiatric workers in London
report that their patients find it
easier to talk to computers titan to
therapists.

Researchers at Britain's National
Physical Laboratory have installed
a computer named Mickie to ques-
tion patients suffering from
alcoholism.

They report that alcoholics arc
expecially frank when discussing
personal and intimate matters with

‘ Mickie. and are far more likely to
admit high alcohol constiniption to

the machine than they are to an iii-
quiring doctor.
How does Mickie succeed where

 

AG EWS ~

mere human beings fail? The
laboratory researchers believe it’s
because the computer merely asks
and receives an answer. and doesn’t
make the moral judgments a human
therapist might when questioning
patients.

England's department of health
is‘ reportedly so impressed by
Mickie's performance it has decided
to buy ﬁve more computers for fur-
ther study.

Strike Ups Sex

An ll-wcck commercial TV strike
in Britain last summer has ap-
parently resulted in a baby boom.

'From August throtigli October
last year, Britain's TV commercial
network was shut down.

Now. the British medical
Association is reporting that many
maternity hospitals iii England are
booked solid begiiiing the start of
this coming April.

According to one medical
association spokesperson: “It's
simple. People had nothing to do
while the TV strike was on, so they
went to bed and made love."

The association says it expects the
number of births to drop into tltc
normal range again innitcdiatcly
after June 24th of this year. That
date is the nine-month anniversary
of the settlement of the TV strike in
litiglantl.

Higher

A medical researcher has
reportedly found that marijuana
users can get much more stoned by
smoking the weed than by eating it.

Dr. (itlITI‘IL‘I Naltas of Columbia
University says he has discovered
that about 50 percent of the intox-
icating agent T-H-C in a sample of
marijtiana is absorbed by the blood
when the weed is smoked. Only five
to 10 perccrtt of the T-I’I-C is
similarly absorbed when the same
amount is eaten. Nahas says.

Nahas concludes — in scientific
terms — “Smoking results in a bio-
availability five to 10 times greater
than by ingestion of the drug."

tions Commission to begin the
world's ﬁrst direct-to-home satellite
television broadcasts. ~,

COMSAT says that direct-to
home broadcasting will complett
by-pass existing television broao-
casting systems. '

Subscribers to the new system
will receive a roof-top disk antenna
which will enable them to pick up
broadcasts directly from a COM-
SAT satellite overhead in earth or~
bit.

Some broadcasting' experts are
predicting that direct-to-home
systems will put an end to the cur-
rent domlnance by the networks of
the television market since networks
can be by-passed completely.

COMSAT hopes to have the
system in full operation by I984.

Suds

College students around the
cottrttry are getting a vicarious
liberal education in thwarted love
affairs. unwanted pregnancies, tin—
faitliftil spouses, divorce and
bizarre illnesses.

That's what two Northern llliiiois
University professors have found in
a study of the growing number of
college students who watch soap
operas on television.

Professors Myles Brcen and Jon
Powell estimate that as many as 40
percent of the female students and
it) percent of the male students at
Northern Illinois University are
soap opera addicts. llrcen and
Powell say that 21) years ago. or
even it) years ago. college students
“wouldn‘t Iltl\'t.' been caught dead
watching soap tipei'as.‘H Now. they
report. it's a “nationwide
phenomena."

In a survey of more than 500 col-’
lege viewers. 40 percent said they
watched because they were iii-
trigrtcd with the plots; 30 percent
said they liked the programs
because the characters were “so
dumb." Nearly 14 percent said they
watched because the troubles of TV
characters made their owrt pro-
blems seem trivial; and another 14
percent said they identiﬁed with
some of the characters.

Professor Powell said he didn’t
feel it httrt students intellectually to
t'ollow the soaps because the time
they spent stirring at the ttibe pro-
bably would have been spent drink-
ing beer or in other nonessential
pursuits.

"Crttising,’I expected to be one
of the most controversial films of
the year. will open in theaters
around the country February l5th.

Producer .lerry Weintrtiiib will
hold a special advance screening of
the film on February 4th in
response to what he terms “extreme
prejudice from gay activist
groups."

Welntraub says he will invite gay
activists and members of the gay
press to View the filtit. after which

will hold a press conference to
answer “any and all questions."
