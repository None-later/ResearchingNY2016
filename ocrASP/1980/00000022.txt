(AP) The US. Olympic Commit-
t‘acirig an appeal by President
Carter and sharply divided opinions
from American athletes, will meet
next weekend to consider the
possibility of not sending a team to
Moscow for theSummer Olympic
Games.

"That will be one matter discuss-
ed, among others." says Col.
Dcnald F. Miller. executive director
of the USOC. “All options and
alternatives will be properly discuss-

..
elet this time as well. the usoc
will poll titottsands of prospective
American Olympic athletes in hopes
of getting a feel of the national
pulse on the subject.

in addition to the USOC affair in
Colorado Springs. Colo.. on Jan.
26 and 27. Miller said Sunday that
he has arranged a subsequent
meeting between representatives of
his organization and ircland‘s Lord
Killanin. president of the interna-
tional Olympic Committee. to
discuss “all aspects of this difficult
and sensitive situation.“

The ntceling with Killunin was
scheduled to take place Feb. 8. 9 or

10 at the 10C meeting at Lake
Placid. N.Y., according to a state-
ment from Miller.

“The USOC has a trust in
representing our American athletes
in the international Olympic move-
ment -— both the athletes of this
generation attd those of future
generations," said Miller. “We
believe that the President of the
United States recognizes that
trust.”

Killanin. meanwhile. has reaf-
firmed his insistence that the 1980
Summer Olympic Games cannot be
shifted from Moscow.

"There is no question of their be-
ing moved to another venue.”
Killanin was qttoled today in. The
Times of London. “This is a time
for cool heads and quiet voices.“

He again said, as he did last
week. that the 1980 Carries were
awarded to the Soviet Union in
1974, and unless the Soviets break
the terms of that binding agree-
ment, the games cannot be legally
moved.

“This does not mcan that l or the
10C arc condoning the political ac-

tion taken by the host country."

The reaction from the Olympic
chief and his American counterpart
came as a result of Carter's
nationally-televised appeal Sunday
for the Summer Olympics to be
moved out of Moscow, postponed
or canceled ifthe Soviet Union does
not pulls its troops out of

....,. .,.r.. M... U

Afghanistan in a month. Carter
also urged that both the Summer
and Winter Games be moved to a
permanent site in Greece. where the
modern Olympics began in 1896.

Killanin, in a weekend interview in

'Dublin. said of Russia‘s recent

military intervention in
Afghanistan. “but if we started to
make political judgements it would

be the end of the Games."

Although Carter has no legal
authority to block sending
American athletes to Moscow. the
President said he sent a message to
the USOC on Sunday in which he
outlined his position and urged that
the organization present his views
to the 10C. the only group that can
tnovc the Games.

"We had never beaten them.
They were playing in their home ci-
ty. They had lic\'t,‘r bccit in the
Super liowl before. We were on the
verge of setting history.

We had doubts. especially iii the
first half when we were lethargic.
Every lithe we’d score. they would
come back at us. Ferragamo played
a super game.”
