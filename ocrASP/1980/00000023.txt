DePaul Stays Clean; Syracuse Blemished by ODU

(AP) Dale Browrt didn’t like tltc
odds, but he didn’t mind tlte final
score . . . even though he lost. in

his eyes. it was a moral victory in_

the classic sense.

“We lost our leading scorer and
rebouttder just as the ganre
started." pointed Girl the Louisiana
State coach. "Then our big man
fouled out early in tlte second half.
Our next-leading scorer played the
rest of the way witlt four fonts and
we got only five free throws to their

On top of all that, LSU had to
play lit wltat Brown called “one of
the worst gyms in tltc country."
DePttul's intimidating Alumni Hull.

“And we still didn't lose until the
final 50 seconds . . . I would have
to say that would give us tr
psychological advantage if we hap-
pen to meet DcPaul again," said
Brown, obviously thinking of a
possiblc shot at the Blttc Demons in
the NCAA tournament.

All this happened Sunday in what
Brown called a “gutsy, gutsy ef-
fort." a 78-73 loss to the nation's
top-ranked college basketball team.

Starting with the disadvatttagc of
playing in Del’aul's gym, Brown‘s
Tigers lost top scorer Durand
Mttcklin to injury no tnore than 22
seconds into the game. Early in the
second half. both 7-foot Rick Mat-
tick and 6-9 DeWayne Scales of
LSU drew their fourth fouls, with
Mattick leaving the game with his
ﬁfth with 15:57 to play.

Scales stayed on to finish with 26
points, 18 of them iii the second
Italt'and 16in the final ten minutes.
DcPaul held several 10-point leads
in the second half, but couldn’t put
the Milt-ranked Tigers away until
Clyde Bradshaw converted three
free throws in the final seconds.
Mark Aguirre scored 31 points for

the winners. including 13 of 14
from the foul litre.

“What more do you wattt from a
ballplayer.” asked DePauI coach
Ray Meyer of Aguirre. “When you
go to the free throw litre 14 times.

rtte you're not just standing
