Pittsburgh Remains Super By Defeating Rams

 

Los Angeles Players Feel
Proud Despite 31-19 Loss

PASADENA. Calif. (AP) “We had
the chanée to be great and we didn’t
quite make it." said Los Angclcs
Rams' defensive end Fred Dryer.
“The Steelers are the champs, great
champs, and l respect them.

“But they know it could have
been us instead of them.".

The Rams. longshots even to
make it to Super Bowl XtV and
longshots to beat the three-time
champion Pittsburgh Steelers when
they did get there, almost reached
football's pinnacle after struggling
uphill all season.

But when it was over Sunday in
Pasadena's Rose Bowl. the heavily
favored Steelers had ended the
Rams' hopes of once again over-
coming great Odds, as Pittsburgh
came from behind for a 31-19 vic-
tory. ‘ -r
Following the gamefwhich they
led most of the way urttil the fotrrth

quarter. the Ram players were ex- W.

tremer weary and rttost spoke in t:
low tones. But they were proud.
“We went Gill and played as well ‘

three interceptions of Pittsburgh
quarterback Terry Bradshaw.

Offensive tackle Doug France
said. “1 hope the way we played
made people realize that we really
are a good team. lt'il depend on
what the reporters write about the
game since fans tend to believe what
they read. i guess.

“But i know the players and
coaches from both sides thought it
was a hell of a game. There was
some kind of hitting out there; l'm
more tired than l’ve ever been after
a game."

Two key plays for Pittsburgh
were a pair of long touchdown
passes by Bradshaw, one of 47
yards to Lynn Swarm in the third
period, and another of 73 yards to
John Stallworth in the fourth to
give the Steelers a 24-19 lead. Rams'
cornerback Rod Perry was ‘the
defender on both plays.

Swann. "0n the Stallworth
touchdown. there was a bust in our
coverage; 1 was suppOsed to get
help and i didn’t."

Two Rams, who had played
almost error-free football for the
first three periods. made costly
mistakes in the closing moments.
The ﬁrst came when quarterback
Vince Ferragamo threw an intercep-
tion that stopped a drive in Steeler
territory, the second when corner-
back Pat Thomas was called for
pass interference in the end zone to
set up Pittsburgh's final score.

“We could have won if I hadn't
thrown that interception." said Fer-
ragamo. who completed 15 of 25
passes for 212 yards and suffered
just that interception.

0f the pass interference call,
Rams’ Coach Ray Malavasi said:
“it was just a bad call. 1 could see it
clearly from the sidelines, and
Thomas did not interfere.”

Thomas. who tattglcd with Pitt-
sburgh receiver Jim Smith on the
play. would say only, “it was a
'0 ry call "

Relieved Terry Bradshaw
Humbly Accepts MVP

PASADENA. Calif. (AP) There he
stood on a one-foot podium, his
bare midriff showing beneath a cut-
off undershirt. a red baseball cap
sitting rakishly on his head and one
hand clutching a package of chew-
ing tobacco.

Knee-deep in reporters,
microphones and clicking cameras.
he looked beat but happily relieved
and like anything but the Most
Valuable Player of Super Bowl
XIV.

“l was surprised to get the
MVP," said Terry Bradshaw.
“Usually it doesn’t go to someone
who throws three interceptions."

Tlten, as if recalling that the
honor brings him a new sports car
from Sport Magazine. he added
quickly:

“But I'll take it."

It was typical of the old bald
eagle of the Pittsburgh Steelers who
as quarterback not only led his

           
 
 
  
 
  

  

awesomely talented. hard-hitting
teammates to art unprecedented
fourth Super Bowl crown but also
matched Bart Starr's consecutive
MVP honors won in 1966 ad 1967.

He basked itt the victory limelight
with dignity and grace.

And humility —
humility.

He didn‘t thrust out his chest. He
refused to gloat. He had nothing
but praise for his beaten adversary,
the Los Angeles Rants. beaten 31-19
in one of the most exciting slugfests
in the 14-year history of the season-
end extravaganza. and the teatn's
raw young quarterback Vince Fer-
raganto.

“This one was the toughest," he
said. looking back over the Steelers’
previous triumphs in 1975, 1976.

Defaults Are Key In Loss

by Mike Williamson

The Albany State wrestling team
was defeated by eastern power Col.
gate this past Saturday in University
Gym by a score of 37-12. The
somewhat lopsided score was due in
part to the fact that Albany was
forced to forfeit two weight classes.
At 126 Steve Zucker was unable to
compete due to a knee injury. and
the team also forfeited at
heavyweight-

With the absence of Zucker. Seth
zaruek dropped from his usual 126
pound class down to 118 where he
defeated Paul Scto of Colgate by a
score of 4-3. Albany then forfeited
at 126. and at 134. Colgatc's Greg
Bray narrowly defeated Albany's
Rob Spagitoli by a score of 3-1.
Mark Dailcy defeated his opponent
at 142 by a score of 9-4, winning his

fourth consecutive dual match since
the holiday recess.

The remainder of the match was '
controlled by Colgate. and by the
time Paul Hornbach's match came
at 177. the match was already decid-
ed. Witlt this in mind. the Colgate
coach chose to forfeit the weight
class to the undefeated Albany Cap-
tain. ratltcr than risk injury to his
wrestler. Albany wrestling coach
Joe DeMeo then forfeited the 190
pound class wltcre Vic Herman
would have wrestled had Albany
still been itt contention. Colgate
won by forfeit at heavy weight to
finish the scoring.

The loss leveled the Danes season

Women Cagers Trounced

After falling behind 35-12 at
halftime to tough Division 11 Le-
Moyne Saturday afternoon. the
Albany State women’s basketball
team could ttot recover, and was
defeated 64—32. The loss drops
Albany‘s record to 3-4.

Albany women‘s basketball
coach Amy Kidder cited the
halftime deficit as too much for her
y0ung squad to overcome. “When
you get down by 23 points at the
half. it makes things a little tough,"
Kidder ..aid. “We made it more ofu

Drop Second or Season 88-76

by Bob Bellaflore

The Albany State men’s J.V.
basketball team lost their second
game of the season Saturday. as
they fell to Union College 88-76 to
drop their record to 6-2. Although
the Danes were only dowrt live at
the half (39-34). Union opened its
lead to as much as 20 points in tire
second half, before Albanyclosed
the gap.

With only eight available players
at gaittc time, Albany was plagued
by their early season menace-fouls.
This time, forward Duvc Hardy.
guard Brian Rooney. and center
Rick Cornell all fouled otit. 'l'ltat
left the Danes with only the
necessary five players to finish the
last six minutes of the contest. 11

tack, LeMoyne placed three players

high scoring honors went to Theresa
Clarke with nine points. Freshman

eight points for the Danes.

“LeMoyne plays it better calibre
ol' httll than we are playing right
now," Kidder said. “But this team
never gives up. and that‘s encourag-
iitg. They play for the entire 40
minutes."

and little plttying time.

According to Albany J.V.
basketball head coach Steve Kopp,
the game was already decided by tltc
tiittc they left. Defense was the key
as. cited Kopp. the absence of that
particular facet swung the gatuc
over to Uttioti. “They had too
many cltcup baskets. The main pro-
blcitt was luck of defense." said
Kopp. "Seventy-six points might to
be enough. btrt it wasn't. We just
didn't play very well. particularly
on defense."

On the Union side. though. it
scented as if tltirtgs were clicking itc-
cordirig to plan. “'l‘hcir defense was

pretty good," continued Kopp.

“They shot well as a learn.” This is
true, as Urriort boasted scorers with
totals of 22, 21. and 21. while
Albany‘s top man was Gaines with
16. After that was Hardy (10 re-
bounds) and Mike Quito (11 re-
bounds) with 15 points each, and
Glen Phillips and Greg Watson with
12. Kopp ttotcd that there might
have been a slight letdown after last
Thursday's big 106-73 win over St.
Rose. "We weren‘t real intense for
this game.” said the coach.

Kopp says, “Tltcy have more deptlt

to play a lot better than we did

ready to play on Tuesday."
