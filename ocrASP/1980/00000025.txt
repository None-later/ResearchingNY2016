Don Flewelling has experienced

the best of times with his Oneonta‘

State basketball team. but this
season, it has mostly been the worst
of limes. Just three seasons ago, the
Red Dragons were among the elite
in Division ill, and when their 1977
season finally ended, Oneonta
emerged as the number two team in
the entire nation. This year, the
Dragons are struggling, and face
the Danes in University Gym
tonight owning an unusually poor
2—6 record.

“So far. we‘ve played very poor-
ly this season," said Flewelling.
“We're a very. very young team.
and we’ve only played one home
gante so far, so it’s taken its toll.
From last year we lost our top seven
people. and you can‘t lose that
many people in a conference of our
stature."

Oneonta's uncharacteristically
slow start lies in direct oppositiont
to thetr surprisingly quick start 01 a
year ago. After the Dragons 72-71
victory over Albany last season.
Oneonta boasted a 9-2 mark. in-
cluding a 4-0 SUNYAC slate. Tlte
defeat of the Danes was the
Dragon's last important triumph of
the season, however. as they plum—
metted to a 6-6 finish. a final record
of l5-8. and entirely out of tltc con-
ference title picture. .

With losses to Plattsburglt
(73-53). Potsdam (84-67). and Cor-

tland (74-70) in the Dragon‘s only
home game. Oneonta crtters

play and almost ottt of the running
itt the conference’s eastern division.
lint predictions should be reserved,
for when Flcwclling attd Albany
coach Dick Saucrs match wits. the.
ensuing contest is ttsttally an in-
teresting 'one. '

“They are a capable team," said
Sauers. “I know he (Flcwelling) has
had trouble finding the right star-
ting combination. so i can’t predict
who we’ll see start.”

Flewelling has -had problems
establishing a set lineup. and when
asked who his key players are, he

replied “I wish I could tell you.”
Freshman forward Bob Topa (64)
is the Dragon's leading scorer, and
transfer Don Cribb (6-3) has also
performed well for Flewelling, but
with seven underclassmen on the
roster. Oneonta is short on ex-
perience, and Flewelling realizes
that his coaching task this seasot.
differs drastically from seasons
past.

“Our preparation is something
entirely different this year," com- '
mented Flewelling. “We have to
solve our problems first before we
can worry about causing problems
for the other team. in the past.
when w‘e had a few‘ real good
players. we could work on different
offenses and defenses. Now we are
deing many things differently.
We're trying to build our program
— that's the stage we're in now. it's
a very different situation from what
we're used to.".

   

According to Sauers. one aspect
of Onconta's gameplan will not be
altered tonight. “We know that
they will cotnc ottt with a zone
defense. and we are going to have to
attack attd score off their-zone. And
their record is deceiving. They are
the type of tcatn. that if they get
ahead early, they cart give you pro—
bletns.”

The Danes are coming off a
tense. exciting, but ultimately
frustrating 70-68 overtime loss to
SUNYAC-leading Potsdam. and
Saucrs is not quite sttrc how his 10-2
squad will handle the setback. “it
was a difficult loss." Sattcrs said,
“and I don't know how we’ll react.
But Oneonta is a traditional rival.
so we'd better be up for tltc game."

“We‘ve always played Albany
tough.“ stated Flewelling. "We’ve
matched up personnel-wise with

     

them. and it's been an even rivalry.‘ "

1 think a lot depends tonight on
how Albany comes back after their
loss to Potsdam. One other thing —
l'm glad their home winnittg streak
is broken.”

The Danes wouldn‘t mind star—
ting another one tonight.

The Albany State men‘s swim
team rebounded in superb fashion
from the winter break to defeat
Bridgcwater State College and a
“quality” Division 1 University of
Vermont on Saturday.

in the tri-tneet. the Danes
defeated Bridgewatcr by a lopsided
92-18 score and thwarted Vermont
66-47. Vcrntont placed third overall
in the Great Dane Relays earlier this
season.

“The majority of the swimmers
stayed active over vacatiott. When
they got back we worked hard rigltt
away." commented Albany men’s
swittttttittg coach Ron White

“In the solid week of practice
that we had to tune-up for this
meet. we had intense workouts
comprised of tltrce hours of swim-
tning caclt day and weight training
thrcc times last week.” mentioned
switnmcr Tom Roberts.

Opening up the festivities was the
400 yard medley rclzty which was
the first of a slew of records that
were brokctt. A medley team of

Steve Bonawitz. Joe Sltore. Frank
Heter and Dave Zybala outdistanc—
ed the Vermont squad by over eight
seconds in 15:47.6. The winning time
was good cttough to~cruslt RPl's
oldstanding pool record of 3:493.
Heter mentiotted that "this time is
in range of qttalifyittg for the na-
tionals in the event."

The lO(X) yard frccstyle placed
Albany second attd third. with John
Doerner and Steve Ellenbcrg
finishing behind Vermont‘s first-
placc finisher Steve Levy.

Kevin Altcrtt broke his own pool
record itt the 200 yartl freestyle;
placing first in tltc cvcttt with a
1:51.3‘l.l seconds better than his
1979 record. "I felt real good. I ltit
my turns real well along with a good
start. We worked ottt pretty hard
over vacation and the times showed
real well." Altertt said.

Capping off another first-phth
finish was Roberts, wlto out-swam
tltc rest of the field with a 23.6 itt
tltc 5t) yd. freestyle. “The race went
well. We blcw them away.
Although i won the race, it was still

a full second off my best tintc in tltc
event," stated Roberts.

The Danes followed-up with a
first attd second place finish in the
200 yard individual medley. Sltorc
took high honors in 2:07.76, cdgittg
ottt teammate l-leter. “it was a real

tion between Joe and l for

California Governor attd
presidential hopeful Edmund G.
"Jerry" Brown drew a standing-
roont—only crowd itt SUNYA’s
Campus Cctttcr ballrootn Tuesday.

[It tltc presentation. co-sponsorcd
by SUNYA's Political Science
Department and Political Sciettcc
Association, Brown criticized iltc
Carter administration attd outlined
his policies for change.

Brown began by discussing the
1980 presidential campaign. which
he described as a “process that is
progressively deteriorating.”

He called upon students to fortn
a “new political coalition" to
“bring new values into the
(political) process." Brown tltctt
responded to complaints about
local elcctiott laws which do ttot
allow studcnts to vote as Albany
residents. He called tltc laws
“inefficient” attd said students
“bettcr start tltc rcvolutiott now."

Unemployment. Missiles. ()il

Brown emphasized tltc impor-
tattcc of domestic problems. which
he feels should play a larger role itt
tltc presidential campaign than they
presently do. He pointed ottt
unemployment as ottc of our largcst
domcstic problctns. proposing a
program of cnvirotnncmal conscr-
vatiott which would involve
“putting Americans to work" in a
way that “doesn't \vrcck the en»
virontnent.”

Discussing tltc federal defense
budget. lit'own criticized Carter‘s
proposal to spend $50 million on
tltc MX missile system. "$50
million in mass ttausit for people is
tttttclt more intportrattt tltatt spen—
ding $50 tttilliott on a racetrack for

Brown otttlittcd a policy of call—
ing on our allies, singling ottt Ger-
many attd Japan. to pay for a larger
share of American~provided
defense. He suggested that tltese
funds be used iii the Mid-East attd
to “rebuild at borne."

Under a Brown presidency, ltc
said, gasoline ratiottittg would be
implemented to “send out a
message of discipline" to the
American people as well as to
decrease our “vulnerability” caus-
ed by a dependence on Mid-East
oil.

Wltctt questioned on ltis position
on nationalization of all industries.

arey Slashes SUNY Budget

   

January 25, 1980

 

by Michele lsntel

Massive cutbacks in SUNY ex-
penditures ltave been proposed by
Governor Hugh Carey itt his
1980-81 Executive Budget. State
fiscal plans call for tile worst finan-
cial setback to hit SUNY since the
'arly 70s, -

Carey has called for a
$12,300,000 base rcductiott in
SUNY expenditures. which will
result in the elimination of 1,125
positions.

ltt addition. Carey has fttrtltcr
proposed to cut tltc lntdgct by $14
million for the purpose of reex-
tttnittittg current staff and pro»
grants.

The proposed budget is based on
a SUNY—wide enrollment Icch of
161,976 full-time students. a
dccrcasc of about 1.500 stlltlcttls
frottt the 1979-80 bttdgct levels. nc-
cordittg to lisccutive liudgcl
figures.

“So wltat if their pigs, cows, attd

“They'll just eat less nteat and pro-

“The picture gets even cloudicr

itt staff and prograttts.

“There will ltavc to be an internal
campus process to discuss wltat

results." said Hartigan.

Dean of Student Affairs Neil
Brown said the impact of the pro—
posed budgct will ttot be fully
known until passed by the
legislature itt March.

HOWL‘YCI'. lte explained that cur-
rcttt cutbacks ltavc severely reduced
staff itt SUNYA's Financial Aids

Office. and in other student affair‘

offices.

"There are big reductions in big
lumps," said SUNY Chancellor of
Finance and Business Harry
Spindler. “but we don't know what
actions to take now.”

Spittdlcr said it is possible tltat
through the elimination of positions
sotnc substantial academic pro-
grams will be cut. He added that
campuses or schools may also be
clitttittatcd. “Sometlting’s got to
go."

“Take tltc specific nutnber of
1,125 positions. That’s tnorc staff
than exists itt any arts and science

college," said Spindler. “This is the
most severe cut."

However. according to Carey's
Deputy Press Secretary Bill Snyder.
SUNY has not been bit harder than
any otltcr state institution. "it's an
across the board reduction. The
severe cutbacks have been ntade to
reduce the level of spending on state
and local levels."

SUNY. ltc added. is contributing
two perccttt to the sttttcwide reduc-
tiott itt expenditures as are all other
agencies. “'l‘ltcsc agencies go from
tltc Council of tltc Arts to tire Divi-
sion for Youth," said Snyder.
