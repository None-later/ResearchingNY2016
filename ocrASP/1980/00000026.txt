'WASHINGTON (AP) Opponen'ts of Pres. Carter’s_ plan to
register draft-age youths vowed Thursday to “picket.
teach-in. protest and demonstrate” in every major city, but
acknowledged they will have a hard time stopping the pro
gram. As student groups and others mapped campaigns to
rally public opinion against registration, several members
. of Congress denounced Carter’s action and promised to try
’ to block it. One idea being examined is an attempt to deny
the administration the money it would need to take the
Selective Service System out of mothballs. where it has been
since l975 when President Gerald Ford halted registration.
_ . Carter already has authority under his
executive powers to order registration. Congress also would
have to change Selective Service laws if Carter decided to
compel women as well as men to register. in his State of the
Union address Wednesday, in which he announced plans to
begin registration for the draft, Carter did not say whether
he intended to register women. Administration officials
have said that is an open question. The president already
has strong backing oti registration~from key congressional
leaders. including Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd
and Hottse Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill. and it appears now
that his plan would be approved. House Republican Leader
John Rhodes of Arizona said Carter has overwhelming sup-

Wellington Buses Rerouth in ’Sa'fetthove.

by Patricia Branley

in an attempt to protect students
living in the Pine Hills “student
ghetto." the: weekend Wellington
bus has been rc-routed this
semester. according to Physical
Plant Director Dennis Stevens.

According to SUNYA Supervisor
of Vehicle Operations Bill Gatlien.
the Wellington's new route went in-
to effect on January 14. The
changes are effectiv' after (i p.ni.,
he said.

According to Stevens. the bus
travels its regular route biit turns
right on Ontario Street and stops iii
front of Alitiiiiii Qttzid‘s l’icrcc
Hall. The bus then makes an im-
mediate left onto Western Avenue.
a left on Quail Street. and a right
btick to Washington Avenue to con-
tinue its regular roitlc.

"Both the Wellington and Alum-
iii buses will make stops at any cor-

schedule or route have been made."

“The small buses have to be used
on this Ontario-Quail loop because
the larger buses cannot make the
turns." said Gathen.

Gatheii anticipates no problems
maintaining this loop. He said.
“Even with snow and trafﬁc the
loop'can be made using the small
buses."

“This route. which previously ex-
isted iii l976 and 1977. only had to
be suspended on one or two occa-
sions due to extreme snow,‘ Gatlieii
said.

Accorditig to Stevens. there is
presently enough manpower to staff
this type of bus service although
two-and-a-hulf positions have been
lost due to cutbacks and no over-
time can be authorized.

“However. this manpower situa-
tioti may be a problem iii bad
weather when there is an increase iii

sick." Stevens said.

He added, “We are making no
percenreffort to deal with this shor-
tage. but already there is a visible.
immediate impact on all bus ser-
vice. This has made it necessary to
eliminate sotne runs."

Short Run Problems

An additional problem Gathcn
cited was that “stopping oti request
could cause a delay in the bus
schedule."

“I feel that this bits route is ati
important factor in providing safety
in the downtown campus area but it
makes inc angry to have this route
bcittg used as it short run bar bus.

servicing those going from
O'Heaney's to Washington
Tavern." Stevens said.

“it’s purpose is to eliminate
walking from Washington Avenue
to a dormitory.” he added.

The new bus route is a result of a
proposal raised last semester at a
meeting of the President's Task
Force on Women's Safety. The task
force. an advisory group created by
SUNYA President Vincent
O‘Leary. was created in response to
'tlie recent rash of assaults in the
Pitie Hills area.
of administrators and students, ad-

dresses the growing concerns of.

women's safety on and off the cam-

 

‘ P3829?“

'pus. Numerous projects are cur-

rently being undertaken. ,

Task Force Goals

The installation of an onvcampus
emergency telephone system. pro-
viding student 'patrols and escorts,
and training women in self defense
are some of the group's goals. ac-
cording to Task Force member
Janice Fine.

The task force is responsible for
the improved lighting conditions on
Partridge and Ontario Streets. At a
meeting last semester a proposal for
adequate lighting in the downtown
area was made. Stevens said.

During the recess, through the
combined efforts of the City.
Niagara-Mohawk and Stevens,
sodium vapor lights were installed.
“This should make the.area more
secure." said Stevens.
