Senate, SA Get IntdACT'

continued from page three
involved in-completing the booklet.
ACT is divided into two sections:
faculty evaluation and course
evaluation. Results include student
responses to l8 individual questions
and an overall evaluation of in-
dividual courses and instructors.
Somach believes that this ar-
rangement successfully measures
tltc basic ingredients of teaching
and education. These. ltc said. rc-
maln unchanged from department
to dcpttrtntcnt.
Cannon, Dcpls. Question ACT

ttscd across many divcrsc ttcttdctnic
ttrctts fail to ntccl tltcir individual
ncctls. According to Sotnttch. otltcr
dcpat'tmcnts httvc rcl‘uscd to use

'ACT, calling the program a
duplication of their own in-
tradcpartmcntal evaluation
systems.

“ACT has not been well-
administered." said University
Senate Chair Harold Cannon.
"People say they are coming one
day and then they don't come.
Then they sltow up at the last
minute and say ‘wc wattt to evaluate
your class today.“ "

(‘ttnnon said that while he is not
opposed to ACT itself. hc rctnains

plementation on tt nttivcrsity-widc
basis. It" the solc purposc of an
evaluation is to improve teaching.
he said, tltcn its results nccd ttot
necessarily be pttblishcd.

According to Cannon, the

k I
publication of ACT results might

prove harmful to some depart-
ments. while student criticism might
not be justified. “it might not help
enrollment." he added.

While Mitchell denied the validity
of Cannon's accusations. Somach
acknowledged that problems do cx-
ist. The latter attributed these to
troubles which he claims will be
solved if SUNYA assumes respon-
sibility for ACT and uses its
resources to publish the evaluation.

Evaluation or Grapevine?

While Cannon claimed that
students can obtain information
concerning courses and professors
froth thcir fellow students. SA

Newmark. “That’s when we really
need ACT.” ‘ '

Tnnsfcr'Now in Senate Hands

First published about six years
ago as an SA project. ACI‘ was
discontinued in 1976. SA made
another attempt at the booklet a
year and three moriths ago. and has
since come out with two publica-
tions. A third publi;ation is cur-
rently in the works.

In order for ACT to become

' tag; at.

ﬁnlversity-wlde, it must be recom-

mended by the Educational Policy
Council of the University Senate.
The recommendation would then
go to SUNYA President Vincent
O’Leary. who is charged with a
final decision.

The University Senate proposal
requests that, in the event of failure
to be acocptcd'as a university-wide
method of evaluation, individual
departments submit ' their evalua—
tions for publication.
