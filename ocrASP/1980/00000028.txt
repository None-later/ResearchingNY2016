Stlnky’s Healthy"

A lecturer at Oxford University
says that his own four-year study
has convinced him that it is better
for a child to be called “Stinky”
than just plain old "Fred".

Professor Ron Harrc. writing in
Psychology Today magazine. says
that he has interviewed thousands
of people in his study of childhood
nicknames.

He says he has concluded that
“those who have no nicknames
have no social cxistcncc — they are
non-people."

According to the professor. to be
nicknamed is to be judged worthy
ofattention by your peers — even if
the attention is unpleasant. Tints.
Harrc says. it may be better to have

a name associated with sewage than
to be referred to as merely as
“John”.

Sweet Safe Sex

Here's something for men who
like sex and sugar.

The Fulurisl magazine says
British scientists have reportedly
found a safe contraceptive for
males that also appeals to the sweet
tooth.

Tests with chlorinated sugars in
animals indicate that the compound
thoroughly inhibits fertility without
affecting libido, the scientists claim.

the energy they need to survive long
enough to fertilize ova.

Timed Partying

if you're one of those people who
likes to nurse your drink at the bar.
here's a place to avoid.

A drinking establishment called
“Le Boudoir" in Amsterdam’s
famous redlight district charges by
the minute instead of by the drink.

According to a report from
Pacific News Service. a door atten-
dant punches customers in on a
timccard. and from there they are
charged about 50 cents a minute. It
doesn't matter what you drink ——
but you have to stick around for a
minimum of IS minutes.

Holy Deductions

The Biblc has become the latest
tax shelter.

Willian Brennan. an expert on
tax shcltcrs. reports that Bible pro-
motch are currently offering a plan
in which a person can buy a large
batch of Bibles at one-third the
retail price.

So what's so great about having a

you get the opportunity to wor

For more information merely mail in the coupon

bundle of Bibles on your hands?
Brennan says that if you hold on to
them for a full year and then give
them away. you can claim a deduc-
tion against your income taxes of
about three times the amount you
invested in The Holy Books.

The only catch is that you can’t
just distribute the Bibles to all your
friends: you have to give them to a
single organization . . . and that
might not be so easy.

Pot Shop Busted

A so-callcd “Dial-A-Joint" com—
pany in New York City — a firm
that offered at‘least six grades of
marijuana to interested pot-
smokers — has been busted by New
York police.

The “Dial-A-chd“ pot shop on
the lower East Side had been advcr-
tising in The Village Voice that it
would even deliver the weed to
customers who phoned in minimum
“one ounce" orders.

New York magazine carried a
small news item on the pot shop last
week. and the police apparently
decided it was time to lower the
boom. ()l‘l‘iccrs swept in and ar-
rested ll employees and customers.
including the shop‘s alleged pro-
prictor.

The cops say they seized several

When asked what America’s role
in the Mid-East should be. he said
our involvement could be “serving
the coffee and donuts, providing a
room, but no more."

It is also interesting to note how
much nicer a candidate becomes
while campaigning. As i remember.
Mr. Brown was in quite a huff when
he saw himself characterized in
Doonesbury, and was actually suing
its creator. in the SUNYA ballroom
on Tuesday, though. he seemed to
have had quite a change’ of heart.
and said he felt “quite neglected"
over his recent non-appearance.

The most l'lippant remark,
however. was a quick. obviously
ad—Iibbcd joke in a situation he was
uncomfortable in. The crowd out-
side was quite upset about not get-
ting in. and tile pounding mob at
the door was trying to press in
against the arms of desperate
ushers. Brown looked over. smich
and said that it “looks like the
Carter campaign." He thcn recom-
mended for the doors to be opened.
“and let everybody in." an ex-
trcmcly dangerous move.

Overall. though. Brown succeed-
cd at SUNYA. and must‘vc scored a
few votes. the point of it all.

There was just onc topic Bro“
wouldn't talk aboul at all: Lllldu
Ronstadt. When someone in the
crowd ycllcd out for her. Brown
mcrcly said. “There's one in every
crowd.“ and moved on.

Alas. though. when the crowd
did disperse and met up with friends
who did not attend. tltc invariable
qucslion was just. “Did he say
anything about Linda?"
