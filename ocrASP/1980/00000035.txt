Quad and off campus residents. on campus

as. midnight‘for movies, parties. etc., were
also involved. in addition. although Miss
15ml mentioned the SUNYA police as pro-
viding shuttles. she did not do justice to the
excellent service they provided.

At t:l5 a.m.. Officer John Haner began
the shuttle at the Social Science bus stop.
Other officers began to follow suit, filling
SUNYA security cars with seven students at a
time. As passengers were dropped at their
ﬁnal destinations more students were piled
into the cars to fill the spaces. This continued
throughout the early hours of the morning so
that no one was stranded. Although our‘
public safety department is for front perfect.
this is one case where credit is due for a job
well donc.

Don’t Exploit Women

To the Editor:

This Icttcr is itt reference to tire movie
Super Vixen being presented on campus this
week by the class of I980. Class of I980 dues
are being spent on this prejch irt hopes of
raising money. We don't feel that iii an in-
stitution of ltigltcr Icar'rtiitg. class councils
should be endorsing, such a degrading view of
worttcrt. The movie and tire posters
represented are extremely offensive to
worttcn. Any person who walks ttronnd tltc
campus is forced to view these exploitative
posters.

Class dues are supposed to be spent on
projects iltat will benefit the class its a whole.
We realize that the class officers probably
chose this movie with financial success in
ntirtd. Monetary gains are tto justification for
tire showing of this movie.

We ask that class council officers iii the
future have sortie respect for their constituen-
cy of hotlt sexes.

Skiing In Style?

Tti the Editor:

This season. tltc thought of snow is it

general. no skiing to he dortc. l-lowcvcr. thcrc
are it few dichard. adventurous people who
sought relief with a trip run by fire Albriny

bush Travel Club of Vermont.

The ski trip made reference to was adver—
tised its it ‘Ski and Party chk iii Cnnttdit'.
Organized by the acting heads of the Ski
Club. Stevc Beilach and Skip Spcrling. tltc
trip turned out to be art unfortunate advert-
ture in rip-offs and misleading statements.

The ski conditions itt Canada were horrid.

four ditys. At the request of Stigttrbtish
Travel. we paid an cxtrtt $10.00 ice, making
the trip $129.00.

Happily we rose at 5:00 rt.tn. the next titty
to journey south ilito Vermont. Arriving ill
Stigitrbttsh Vttllcy wc fotrtttl thitl irt fact we
had no accommodations. This was our first
instance of false inforitttition on tltc part of
Steve and Skip Spcrlirtg. Wc were told til 4:}()

wotrld be secured.

At 4:30 we returned. Mttclt to our disrntty.

The room was situated between the kitchen
and a side door. The room had no lock on the
door.

Distressed. we phorted Steve and Skip at
the Seasons Hotel. Being settled in. we were
told that the issue was out of their hands;
there was nothing they could do. Paul
Tetrattlt was the person to speak to. Getting
tn touch with this man was like finding a nec-
dic in a haystack. When he was reacltcd ltc
proved to be very uncooperative — he gave
us tltc ultimatum of leaving with at $65 citeck
or to “shut the Itcll up."

Tltc trip was, for us, a total wttstc. Skip
and Steve. representing the Albany Ski Club
were totally irtadcquzttc as trip leaders. Patti

would be no first aid training available to thc

teaching first aid here on the SUNYA crim-
pus. Tltc courses taught by Five Quad are
totally independent of the Phys. Ed. pro-
gram. Fivc Qttrtd Ambulance. in its agree-
ment with the University and iii accordance
with its lly-Lttws, is committed to providing
tltc University with first aid instruction.

’I'ltcrcforc. regardless of any possible disrup—‘

tioit irt Mr. Davis‘ program, Ilic University

constrainctl iii tltc rtiiritbcr of courses which
we can offer. Although Fivc Qititd cannot

Te Enemy is Here

Approximately 2500 years ago, man started a technological journey that took him
from the advances of the ancient Greeks to the creation of the atomic bomb. Now, it
is 1980, and man refuses to believe that this technojourney is at its culmination. and
an entire new system of existence is in store for us. -

People have become suddenly upset because President Carter has taken apparent

'first measures towards possible war. Unfortunate as it may be. history has

demonstrated that war is a part of man, as it has never left him in his entire civilized
existence. One does not have to like war; one shouldn't. But for the last 4000 years.
there have been wars, and for the last 4000 years, people fought them with en-
tltttsiasrn. an cniltusiasm they had to muster because they were fighting to preserve
something they wartted to preserve.

Titc currcrtt world situation brings it all together. so predictably. Raving maniacs
screamed years ago that we were using ttp our resources too fast, polluting our en-
virortrncrtt too ltcaviiy. but the sane men in power cltosc to ignorc tltc future and put
dowrt the maniacs. and riot it‘s too late. You’re worried about war? We've already
lost the war against cancer. Wc‘vc won the war against nature —- we've annihilated
the "enemy."

And as America felt so, so secure Iivittg on easy street in the wake of a World War
victory. scvcn completely crazy presidents dictated priorities that let weapon
dcvciopntcnt step up to it tlcgrcc where it sittiittiott Itas been created that is too late to
control. The atomic bomb is definitely iii tlic wrong hands these days. as smaller
countries with unstrtblc governments will soon have the power to start World War
Hi. What happens when all of thc Mid-littst nations have it. when North African Hil-
tions have it. whcn sonic criin dictator uses it?

Thirty ycrtrs of cold Will cscriirition have gone by, and tltcrc had to bc a cost.
Wc‘vc sacrificed America at the cost of making it safe against communism. So this
time no one wtints to fight, and we can’t blame titcrn. because there ain’t nothin'
worth preserving.

The wttr is ill ltorttc. and if yoti want to be really patriotic. that's witcrc you'll stay.
Arc wc going to let millions of Americans die for sortie oil fields that will be gone in
tcrt ycttrs ttttywuy'! if we clcct leadership that contirttics on this destructive, inane
path. tltcrt otir fittc is scaled. Sitting brick and letting govcrrtrttcrtt take care of
Arttcrica is no lottgcr ttcccptzthlc. because government doesn’t know what the hell
they're doing. And if we do sit buck and let all of this happen, that will only prove
just how low tltc so-callcd lenders have pushed the morale of Americans.

Wlictitcr wc agrcc to register for the draft or not is ttot tiic issue. The issue is why
it's ncccssary. why we have no say in it. HOW WE CAN SET THIS RUINED
PLANET STRAIGHT AGAIN!

We have givcrt_control of this world to people who ltave subsequently created cer-
tain frightening incvitttbiiitics. Many of those incvitttbiiitics have already come true.
and the worst of all. nuclear war, scents nearer than ever. This issue is not Iran. it's
ttot registration. it’s rtot Afghanistan. It's all one big issue callcd survival. and we're
losing it first.

We leave you with one thought as you head into your weekend, partying planned.
ftirt on the rttirtd: Just what tltc he” will Monday bring?

Scc you in class. tnnybc.
