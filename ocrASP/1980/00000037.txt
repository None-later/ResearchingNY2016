Weber State Boasts Top Streak"

OGDEN, Utah (AP) Question:
Wltat major college basketball team
has the longest winning streak in the
nation?

It you guessed ISth-rankcd
Weber State College with I7
straight. you probably live in the
Rocky Mountains. ll yott guessed
No. I DePanl, I6-0I you may be
asking yourself, “Weber who?"

But that kind ol‘ anonymity
doesn't bother Coach Neil McCar-
t'hyI whose Wildcats may be one of
the better kept secrets in college

basketball. ‘

Not only has Weber State wen 17
in a row. but the Wildcats in five
years under McCarthy have posted
a 104-46 record and are favored to
with their third straight Big Sky
Conference title.

Weber State has an enrollment of
10,000 and didn't become a four-
year school until 1962. Bttt since
then the Wildcats have been
awesome. going 120-33 under Dick
Motta — new coach of the
Washington Bullets —— and 68-16

under Phil Johnson. an assistant
with the Chicago Bulls.

Still. Weber State always has
been a poor cousin to the much
larger and better-known schools
downstate — Utah and Brigham
Young '

“I just thought we'd eventually
be rated," McCarthy said of his
club's ﬁrst appearance of the
season in The Associated Press‘
Top Twenty this week.

In March, Weber State will get
even more national exposure. Its
12,000 seat Dec Events Center is
one of two West sites for the ﬁrst
too rounds of the NCAA post-
season tournament. and the home
court advantage could propel the
Wildcats into some pretty raril'tcd
company.

Last year. Weber State, 25-9.
heat New Mexico State in the open-
ing round of the NCAA tourney
before losing to Arkansas.

The Wildcats‘ only loss this
season was an opening over—time
road setback to Utah State. Their
winning streak includes a triumph
over defending NCAA champion
Michigan State and a 7‘)»7ii decision
over Nevada-Lats Vegas in the ins
Vegas Holiday Classic.

Mct'at‘lhy starts t‘our seniors and
