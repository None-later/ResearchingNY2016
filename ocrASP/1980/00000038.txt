J. V. ’s Rout Oneonta, 1 07- 74

by Bob Bellafiore

The Albany State men's J.V.
basketball team. recovering from
the loss to local Union, extended
their home winning streak to seven
games Tuesday night by trampling
an extremely out-of-practice
Onconta squad l07-74 in University
Gym. The Danes went up in the
first five minutes. led by as many as
24 points near the end of the open—
ing half. and prevented the Red
Dragons from ever really threaten-
ing throughout the contest.
Albany’s record is now 7-2.

Defense was the name of the
game for the Danes. Even though
they yielded 74 points. tight
coverage enabled Albany to score at
a much quicker rate titan their op—
position. Sub Glen Phillips and
guard Greg Watson both hit for
their seasonal highs, and tied for
the game's scoring honors with 22
points each. Phillips also passed
well, serving up eight assists.

“We just played real good
defense," said Albany J.V. head
coach Steve Kopp. "it was our best
defense of the year. which gave us
many easy baskets."

The good defensive play opened
up the Albany running game.

resulting in the high score (the
Danes' second three-ﬁgure total of
the season). For Oneonta, Jim
Boland (15 points) and Guy Pepe
(to points) Were the only men who
scored in double ﬁgures.

Rounding out the Albany scor-
ing, Mike Gaines and Dave Hardy
had 14 points, and Mike Gatto was
credited with 13. Hardy once again
was a force underneath, pulling
down ten rebounds. seven offen-
sivciy.

Kopp noted that this Red Dragon
learn (who beat Union earlier this
year) had returned to school Mon-
day, and only practiced once since
December l4. The extremely long
layoff ending when it did had a

deﬁnite inﬂuence on Tuesday's
game.

According to Oneonta J.V. head
coach Hal Chase, the visitors were
out of shape. He also stated that
two starters were missing due to in-
jury and illness. but that this
Albany team “would beat us 99 out
of 100 times." Kopp tends to feel
differently: “I expect that game at
their place to be a lot closer than
this one. They're a lot better than
they were on Tuesday," said Kapp.
Onconta’s record is now 3—4.

The Danes travel to RPl tomor-
row to meet the Engineers. After
that. seven of the ten remaining
games will be played on the road.

not pose much of a problem for the
Danes “as long as they didn't make
any mistakes.“ Albany Coach Ron
White used the meet as a sort of
“tune-up" for the important
Potsdam contest tomorrow. “We
tnoved people around to see how
they could do in events unfamiliar
to them. Steve llonawitz's 2115.4 in
the individual medley was a real
good showing," said While.

The meet was characterized by
White as “one of those meets where
nobody stood out. The times were
off and we relied on second and
third place finishes to pull the meet
out."

Winners on the day for the
visiting Danes included .loc Shore,
who won the 200 yard breastroke in
2:26 and the 200 yard individual
medley in 22l2. Diver Bill Derkasch

placed first in the optional diving.
highlighted by his forward, one-
and-a-half, somersault, pike posi-
tion dive. which was given a six-
and-one-half — six —— six-and-one-
half awardings by the judges.

' Wm“liverythings feeling better. That

‘ big week of working out after vaCa-
tion sure helped a lot. The team
swam pretty well even though the
pool seemed slow —.,.maybe because
of the temperature of the water"
mentioned Derkasch.

The Danes won both the relay

Roberts, Dave Zybala. and Frank

Heter capturing high honors in the

400 yard medley rain; ‘Wc swam

hard yesterday (Tuesuay). We were

pretty confident of our relay” said
_Roherls. In the other relay — the
’4tX) yard medley relay composed of.”
Ed l’ierce. lionawitz. Shore. and'

Kerry Donovan scaled the meet vic-

» tory with a two lap triumph. The

Danes needed a first-place finish in
the final event to win the meet.
Moving on, the swim team faces
top Division lll Potsdam tomorrow
at 2 p.m. at University pool.
“We're really up for Potsdam and
we'll give the Beans some tough
' ompetition" said Heter.
