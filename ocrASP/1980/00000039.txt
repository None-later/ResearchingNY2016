DRAGON SLAYERS: Danes Whip Cortland, Oneonta

 

Two SUNYAC Wins Leave

Albany 12-2,- Utica Sat. 

by Paul Schwartz

CORTLAND — A disciplined, poised Albany State
basketball squad pooled all their diverse resources last
night, and they were enough to put away a determined

Cortland team, 76-67.

On-offense, it was the trio of guard Winston Royal
(20 points) and forwards Ray Cesare and Pete Stanish
(18 points each) that provided the Danes with enough
firepower to stifle the rugged Red Dragons. On defense,
it was an aggressive Albany second half zone, coupled
with some wild late-minute shots by Cortland guard
Tom Baez (2] points), that allowed the Danes to pull

away.

“This win puts us in a good spot,” said Albany coach
Dick Sauers. “Our scoring was unbalanced for us, but
those guys happened to have the shots. 1’“

whatever way wins.”

Albany, now 12—2 overall and 4—l in the SUNYAC,

led 40-35 at halftime, but after Cesare’s jumper gave the
Danes a 48-41 advantage, Cortland reeled off six eon-

sccutive points, closing to 48-47. “They had the ball,

and they could’ve gone ahead," Satters said. “They

didn’t, and that was a psychological factor.”

Guard Rob Cltrne found Stanish inside fora basket
as the Danes opened up their largest lead, 64-5], witli
7:20 remaining. Cortland closed the gap to 70-65 with
Gary Mattraw’s short jumper, but Royal’s burst up the
middle and Baez’s errant shot scaled the Albany victory.

On Tuesday. everytlting seemed
primed for an upset —- all the classic
signs were present at Universit-y
Gym. The Danes were coming off a
tough OVertime loss to Potsdam.
and their opponents, the Oneonta
Red Dragons, hardly posed mtteh
of a threat. “When i looked
them in warmups. i thought they
might be able to be taken," said
Oneonta coach Don Flewelling.
“Albany didn’t look really ready to
play."

For much of the first half, the
Danes did nothing to disprove
Flewelling's claim. Although lack-
ing in talent, Oneonta’s intertse play
and puzzling triangle~and~two
defense held Albany in check, and

'l

alter Tim Rice connected on a
jumper. the Dragons only trailed
19—18, and were outplaying the
lackluster Danes.

Albany then began to show signs
of life. Forward Joe Jednak scored

jump shot, and Steve Low came off
the bench to hit two quick baskets.
pushing the Danes' lead to 27-18.

“in the first half we were slug-

about intensity on defense."

“Doe chewed tts out," Kelvin
Jones said. “And defense was what
he chewed tts ottt for. They were
doing what they wanted in the first

Employing an aggressive zone

Despite a valiant second half

Over 1 50 Rally Downtown

by John Moran-

Over 150 people held a peaceful
demonstration atlnoon Saturday to
protest President Carter's plan to
reinstate regiktration for the draft.
The protest, sponsored by the
Albany Peace Coalition. was held
in front of the Broadway Post Of-
l'icc irt downtown Albany in reac-
tion to Carter's State of the Union
address on Wednesday.

A petition condemning the draft
registration was signed by 125 peo-
ple according to Capital District
Anti-Nuclear Alliance represen-
tative .lolm Cutro.

“We only had a couple of days to
organize it. i thought the
demonstration was very sue—
ecssl’ttl," said Cutro.

“The ongoing goal of the Albany
l’eace Coalition will be to develop
widespread oppositiort to the draft
and to stimulate action among the
people who will be most affected,"
said tr spokesperson for the Coali-
tion. l’at Beetle.

Despite adverse weather condi-
tions. the protestors carried signs.
sang peace songs and listened to a

number of speakers during the
hour-long rally. Vietnam draft
resister Steve Tritnrn gave a brief
speech saying that resisting the
draft “is a high price to pay but it is
worth it. You can say no.“

He added that “resisting the
draft is an honorable thing to do.“
According to Coalition member
Rczsin Adams, ’l'rirnm \trrs tried
and sentenced btrt escaped to
Canada for five years, and came
back to the U.S. ttndcr the earned

Adams said. “We

is a war-like move. We oppose the

interests in the Persian (1qu area.

“We applaud what Carter has
done in his handling of the hostage
situation, because military alter-
natives are very dangerous in this
nuclear world," said Adams. She
added that just as Carter realized
that military force wouldn't have
saved the hostages he must realize
that a war in the Persian 6qu area

Former SUNYA Student

Faces Life Imprisonment

 

Hearings to Investigate Past

by Susan Milligan

A former SUNYA student
recently convicted of third-degree
attempted robbery may face a life
jail sentence, according to Albany
County District Attorney Sol
(ircenbcrg.

While the maximum sentence for
the charge is four years imprison-
ment. (it'ccnbcrg noted that the
previous criminal record of John
“Ritchie” Robinson may classify
him as a “persistent felony of-
fender," making him eligible for
harsher punishment.

Robinson was charged in the
December l2. W78 attempted rob—
bery of a Central Avenue branch of
Home Savings liank.

Robinson was further indicted on
charges of third-degree grand
larceny in the July, 1979 robberies
of Manpower, inc. and City Ser-
vice. both on Western Avcrttre. A
total of $750 was involved in these
incidents. ' >

Albany County Court Judge
Joseph Harris will be conducting
hearings to evaluate Robinson's
background and habits. Harris will
determine whether Robinson is “in
need of extended incarceration" of
a minimum [5-25 years and a max-
imum of life imprisonment.

gltte at age seven, and using co~
cainc. heroin. and marijuana," said
(irccnberg. “He l “S a long jttvenilc

in reference to Robinson's [last
record. Greenberg described Robin-
son as “the lowest of the low."

During a court interrogation,

Robinson denied having committed
incest with his sisters. When asked
if he was guilty of ill rapes, Robin—
son rcplied. “No. . .ouly three or
four."

(ircenbcrg stressed that Robin-
son's confessed rapes arc in no way
related to the recent rapes of SUNY
students in the Pine Hills “strident
ghetto" area of Albany.

“’l‘hcsc rapes occurred when

Robinson was in jail." Grecnhcrg
pointed out.

Robinson's defense attorney Lou
Oliver declined comment.

She stated that the Peace Coali-
tion believes that preparation for
war leads to war.

“Our government should start
from the premise that war is not an
acceptable means to protect otrr in-
terests. Our government is trying
non-war means to save the hostages
and we should use non-“at means
in other internatiotntl conﬂicts."
Adams said.

held Thursday night to organize the
demonstration as a reaction to

' Students and the Draft:
Death, Canada, Fear

' by Mike Fried

"I‘m scared. I don 'I want to go
to war and die, but I don’t want to
be labelled a coward or a deserter
and feel Ilia! I ’ve been useless to my
country. My father is a 21-year war
veteran and it would he a slap in his
face. If there were any way out
without humiliation, I 'd take it. "

President Carter‘s State of the
Union address. calling for reinstate-
ment ofthe draft. set off strong stu-
dent reactions on the SUNYA cam-
pus. Some people said they would
fight if they had to. while others
would not even register. Others will
volunteer to ﬁght, and some men-
tioned the possibility of travelling
to Canada.

Greg Crecco. a senior. said he
does not think we should have to
register and a plan for voluntary
registration should he created. “I
think it's wrong that we have to
register," Crecco said. “i guess if i
got a draft notice I'd go, btrt I‘m
only registering because i don’t
want to be charged with a felony."

Sunil Modrtsra, a jtmior. said. “I
think it should be effected because
the United States is not prepared
for a war and a draft will prepare us'
militarily. if I am drafted, i will go
be it]. l mu: stand up for what i

like the thought of war. i

Marc Gronich, a junior, said
“it’s a good move on Carter’s part'.
it's not an arbitrary decision. It’s
for national security. if the USSR
gets control of Pakistan and the
Persian Gulf1 we’d be on our knee's
for oil." He added that he would
register to avoid getting charged
with a felony. but he would go to
Canada if he was drafted.

All the females intervieWed wish—
ed to remain anonymous to avoid
recriminations from friends, '
regardless of their attitudes.

One said that she had mixed feel-
ings. “There is part of me that says
this is the United States and
everyone should want to fight}
however, there is a' part of me that
doesn‘t want my younger brother to
go to war and possibly get killed."

Another girl. a senior, said. “l'm
not going to war. no fucking way.
if Carter wants to start a war. let
him fight in it as well.”

A t'rcslnnan. whose father is' a
veteran of World War ll, said she

registered right away that Friday.
“I love this country and i want to
do all i can to help protect it from
aggression of any kind,“ she said.
“Anyone who goes to Canada is a ’
fucking faggot. I'd have no respect
for them. ' she said.

Residents Frightened; Administrators Calm

by Susan Milligan

Although
ministrutors are not alarmed, stu-
dent residents of Alden and Water—
bury l'ialls on Alumni Quad are
both annoyed and frightened by
numerous complaints of mice in
students' rooms.

“Right after vacation, my room-
mate and i saw a mouse scurrying
down the hull." said Waterbury
resident Bruce Licbcr. “Then one
night we found a mouse in ottr
closet. Since about two days ago.
l've seen them all over the hall."

Waterbury resident Pierre (iramt

' reported seeing a mouse in the
Alden-Waterbury Dining Hall.

“The cook called the exter-
minator. but he never come," said
Grant.

Standard procedure concerning
rodents at Alumni Quad has been to
provide students with rat poison.
Yet several students reported a
recurrence of mice even after using
the poison.

Another Waterbury resident. Pat
llrunlcy, said she “had been sitting
on the bed when a mouse came out

residence ad—

t'rom behind the refrigerator."

“We had bugs last semester,‘

    

said lirauley. "Now the bugs are
gortc, but almost everyone in the
hall has mice."

Alden Hall resident Rich liehar
said that rodents were present last
semester. but no significant action
was taken to remedy the problem.

"i was under the impression that
thc Alden administration would
take care of the probletn durirtg
vacation," said lichar. “Yet, i saw
a mouse two days ago. Obviottsly.
the problctn has not been solved."

According to Alumni Quad

Coordinator l.iz Radko. Alumni
“has had mice for the four years

(she) has been there."

“I have heard general reports
about mice. . .tts far as i know, the
directors are working it out with the
jauitors."

Radko said that she hadn‘t heard
any reports of mice Monday or last
weekend. She added that “although
(she) doesn't want to belittle‘the
situation. (site) hasn‘t heard it is a
major problem."

Waterbury Hall Director Martha
