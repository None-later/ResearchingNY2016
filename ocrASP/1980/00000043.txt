Inhaled Impotence

A University of Louisville
medical researcher claims that
cigarette smoking decreases your
sexual desire. ‘

Dr. lbrahim Syed. who has done
extensive research on smoking, says
that you can warn people not to
smoke because of the threat of
cancer, but they won’t listen to you.
“But if you tell them they'll lose
their sexual capabilities. they'll pay
attention.”

Syed says that tobacco smoke
reduces oxygen levels in the blood,
and that this in turn lowers the
amount of testosterone in males
and estrogen in females. These hor-
ruoncs. ht' suys', are the ones respon-
sible for the sc\ drives of humans.
Syctl claims that ‘urokcrs' \slro lttt\‘L'

mediately after kicking the habit.

Disco’s Banned

The New York City F.M. station
which started the whole disco radio
craze is the latest station to bailout
on the dying disco sound.

WKTU FM started the short-
lived disco radio formal over one
year ago when the change to all-
disco made it the number one .s‘ta»

Contemporary.” Perhaps the
unkindest cut of all is the fact that
the 'station that started the entire
craze prevents the use of the word
disco on its airwaves.

Energy Answer

A New York City inventory says
that those rush-hour traffic jams
and crowded shopping malls cotrld
provide some of the answers to the
energy crisis.

Wayne LcVuu has invented a
device that allegedly generates
energy by harnessing the weight of
people and cars.

LeVan calculates that each “hit”
by a 'car would produce [.5
kilowatts of electricity — or enough
juice to power a loo-watt Iightbulb
for l5 hours.

Omrti magazine points out that'if
six hit plates were installed on busy
expressways in New York — loca-
tions crossed by one million cars a
day — enough electricity would be
generated to meet the daily needs of
tens of thousands of people.

Inventory l.eVan insists that
“weight power cart be classified as a
vast, untapped naltrral resource."

The first l'ul|~scalc model of
LeVan's invention, called a
“trcrrcri/cr". “ill be tested under

i That doesn’t mean, however,
that the popular drug is going out
of style. It’s simply getting a name
:hange. ,

The new name of the drug that
has gained notoriety across the U.S.‘
is going to be Mequin. The drug’s
manufacturers. the Lemmon’Com-
puny of Philadelphia, say only the
brand name and the imprint on the
white tablets will be different. The
active ingredient. Methaqualone.
will reportedly remain the same.

Mequin. or quaaludes, were
originally manufactured to be taken
as sleeping pills. More often.
however. they are taken illegally as
an aphrodisiac.
