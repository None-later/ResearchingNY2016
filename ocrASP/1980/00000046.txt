J.V. ’3 Engineer Eighth Victory

by Bob Bellal'lore

After being down 33-31 at half-
time, the Albany State men's J.V.
basketball team extended their
home winning streak to eight
games, as they beat R.P.l. 78-67
Saturday night in University Gym.
Albany's Mike Gatto led all scorers
with 26 points.

It wasn't until the semnd half
that Albany showad its dominance,
as the Engineers kept the game
witltin reach. But, with the Dane
advantage at three with 7:58 to go
in the contest. Greg Watson
followed-up a Gattp miss to make it
55-50. An excellent Albany delay
forced several R.P.l. defensive er-
rors. and the Danes outscored the
Engineers 7-l in the next 2:49. and
ptrlled away. 62-51. As the Albarty
weave offense drew the defenders

it seemed as if R.P.l. knew how
to handle Albany, as was shown by
the visitors halftime lead. but
superior Dane speed and condition-
ing wore the Engineers down. “We
can’t run with Albany State." said
R.P.l. head J.V. coach Bill
Tweedy. “Those kids (Albany's)
are just too quick." But Tweedy
also emphasized the poor play of
the R.P.l. front line. particularly
with regards to 6-8 center Tom
Truax. “it was the worst game he's
played for us." said Twccdy of iris
big man, who only had two rc-
bounds anti three field goals’lhe ctr-

were on free throws.
