Men’s Track Runs Third In Opener

by Hal Diamond

The men’s indoor track team
opened their season last Friday ‘at
Williams College with a respectable
tltird_place finish. Sprhtgficld cap-
tured ﬁrst with 7| points and
Williams finislted second with 52
and one-half poittts. Albany won
tlte battle for tltird with 36 and otte-
hali‘ points wltile Assumption

fittislted last ltaving accumulated

only ttine points. I

Albany's ittitial performance was
excellent considering tlte fact that
these otlter schools were ittttttittg
titeir third ttteet of tlte season. The
effort was also ditttittisited by a lack
of manpower. Twenty men ottt of
the 40 on the team made the trip to
Williamstown, Mass. Albany in-
door track coach Bob Mttnsey ex-
plained tltat he ‘had to leave tlte
weight men,home since tlte indoor
track budget‘is very tight. Albaity
was forced to forfeit tlte shotpttt
evettt dtte to this lack of funds.

The outlook for this seasott is still
very hopeful. “The tenth will be
better this year titan last," said
Mttttsey. “The sprittters are five
times as strong arid the triple
jumpers look excellent. l like wltat l
see.”

The single most outstanding per-
formance was displayed by Bill
Mathis. The senior ran with lightn-
ing speed in the l000 yard dash. He
completed the first 880 yards in a
sub-four minute mile pace. Mathis
became the only Albany runner to

win an evettt last Friday by captur- ,

ing the 1000 yard rtttt in 2:18.

Matltis also finisltcd third in the
mile with a little of4:2.'l.9. His per-
formance was amply aided by
Sophomore Scott James. These two
cross country runners tested their
endurattce by starting the race too
fast. Mathis attd .Iames finished the
first quarterttogetltcr in a bla/.ittg 62
secottds. Mathis' strength lasted
llllll until lite very last few yards
where lte was passed by a Williams
rtttttter. He finished the mile race
tltird at 4:2}.9. Scott James finished
rigltl behind him with a tittte of
4:27.8.

Mathis seems eager to show the
superior rttttttittg he showed during
his first two years ltere. He bounced
back frottt a sttbpar season to gaitt
the cross country MVP award itt
December. He was elated about his
third and first place finishes. “i
think i should break my personal
record of 4:l(i.5 for the mile this

year.." Mathis said. “l'm in better

shape than ever before at this point -

in the season."

Albany‘s top-notch sprinter
Howard Williams had a decent
ttigltt. He finished third in the 60
yard dash at a tinte of 6.47 seconds.
Yet lie was involved in a mix-up in
the mile relay. Steve Erb and
Cutltbert Denton hadron excellent
quarter mile legs to put Albany in
the lead. Williams was on the inner-
most latte waiting to receive the
baton. However, Denton’ didn't
realile that the official had switched
tlte lanes before the meet. He had to

.slow down and cross over a latte to

find Williams. Williams attd Ferrel-
ti worked hard during the last two
legs to make up for the mistake. bill
it wasn’t enough as Albany finished
tltird iii the tttile relay with a tittte of
3.36.

A fine performance was
displayed by Tony l’errctti iii the
600 yard dash. Ferrctti used his
small 5-6 frame to his advantage on
the circular track. ilis low center of
gravity enabled lllill to easily master
the turns. l"erretti finished the (till)
yard dash with a titnc of 1:18. “i
wasn't itt great shape," commented
Ferretti. “My positiott was fourth

. until the very last lap. There I
wanted to see ifi could catch up to
the leaders. i started my kick early
and maintained it to the’ ﬁnish
which gave me second place."

Ed Prculx. a graduate studént,
was Albany's most consistent par-
ticipant. He took tltird in the high
‘jump at 6'2". fourth in the long
jump at 27’7" and third in the 60
yard high hurdles-in,8.i seconds.

. Albany dominated in the triple
jump competition. Tim <Gunther
and 'Bill Condon finished second

and third,’respeetlvely. Gunther set
a personal record with a 40 and one
half inch high jump while Condon
made his leap at 39'9". ‘

Other outstanding feats were
displayed by BruceShapiro, who
ﬁnished third in the 880 at 2:0].8;
Mike Sayers who ﬁnished third in
the two mile at 9:402; Paul
Eiscltelberger who tied for fourth in
the pole vault at “’6” and Dan lhr-
ing who tied for fourth in the high
jump at 6'0"

Albany women's basketball coach
Amy Kidder.i3y the midpoint oftlte
match, Albany was down, 24—17.

"The second ltalf was better ball
for us." said Kidder. But here the
Danes experienced offensive
troubles, not seeing available holes
itt the defense. An Rl’l press altered
the entire offensive Albany pattern.

With l2 minutes left, Albany was
dowtt by ll poittts. The last eight
ntitttttes of play saw a close situa-
tiott develop between botlt teams.
The Dattcs tied the score at 38-38
with six minutes to go. Albany then
began a series of missed shots and
experienced fotti troubles.

An Albany tttrttovcr lcft RPI up
by six points. 44-38. Later. Albany
cut the lead to two points, 44-42.
The Danes played a ntan-to-ntan
strategy, which they had never at-
temptcd before in a gatite situation.
This did not bettcfit the squad.
“We threw the gattte away," said
Kidder, and site rctttovcd lite
strategy.

Rl’i had two quick baskets and
Alhatty was soon dowtt by six.
48-42. With two minutes remaining.
“we fell apart." told Kidder. The
RPi offense was able to get three to
fottr shots at a time, while iitttitittg
Albany to just one or two.

Rl’l. the taller team, showed
good defensive play attd getteraliy
worked well on the perimeter. “But
they were ttot as good as they were
the last time we faced each other.”
remarked Kidder. ‘

RPl's Mary Halioran scored 23:
points; the game high. Site was able

. to retrievelter owtt rebounds as the

* Danes were unable to box he'r out.
The Albany high scorers were Kim
VBoerner with 18 points and Nancy
Hailoratt tallied itt behind with l3.

“Ri’l pressed us throughout the
entire game. We didn't settle down
after turnovers." said Kidder. also
ttoting that her team did not set up
well during the match.

“We talked all week about defen~
sch work along the ha- .-lines." con‘
tinued Kidder. “Offeitsivcly, we
didn‘t hit the spots we knew woult
be open.” site concluded.
