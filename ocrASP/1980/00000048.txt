Young Gymnasts Miss Point Gaul {

by Lori Cohen

Gymnastics is synonymous with
running and tumbling. but it re-
quires strength. skill, ﬁnesse. and
concentration. as many of the
young Albany women’s gymnastics
team discovered when they met
Northeastern and the University of
Vermont in a tri-meet at University
Gym Saturday afternoon. Nor-
thcastern amassed IO7.20 points.
Vermont 105.50. while the Albany
team accumulated 93.05 points.
Their aim. Albany gymnastics
coach Pat DuvaIl-Spillane said. was
to break 100 points. a goal they did
not achieve.

“The girls had a bad day on the
floor which was very unusual."
Diwali-Spillane said. “The scores
are usually fivc's and six’s. but to
day we hit only thrcc's and four's.
We are a young team. mostly
freshman. and we still have the bttlk

'of our season coming up." The

state meet is scheduled for February
29~Mareh l at Hofstra University.

A women's gymnastics meet con-
sists of four events: vaulting. the
uneven parallel bars. the balance
beam. and the ﬂoor exercise.
Albany did well in the first half of
the program, behind by less than
one point after the vaulting and
uneven bars. Their best event was
still to come. But the balance beam
proved to be their downfall, as
spills and falls off the beam
hampered an .othcrwisc good
overall performance by the young
Danes. Time limits not being met
(each performer has at least l:lS on
the heain and must be off in [:35)
and mounts not being made hurt
the Albany effort.

Elaine Glynn proved to be the
bright spot for the gymnasts, and
she also provided the most dramatic
occurencc of the meet. While on the

parallel bars. Glynn fell off and saw
that her calloused hands had split»
open. She proceeded to rip the open
skin off her hands and they started
to bleed profusely. Yet. she got
back on the bars and ﬁnished her
routine. still managing to score a
6.45 (out of a possible 10). After-
wards, the pain was evident as ice
was applied to her hands to cool
them off. Glynn was having a‘good
day. with fine overall perfor-
mances, but one bad fall in each
event hurt her scores. “The layoff
over the Christmas break hurt me.
and l have been sick." "Glynn said.
“My hands hurt but they did not
have too much effect on me during
the rest of the performances. The
last fall in my ﬂoor exercise. during
my tumbling. hurt my legs. but not
too much." She had done several
aerials and landed flat on her feet.

F orfeits, Injuries Key
In Wrestling Setbacks

by Mike Williamson

The Albany State wrestling team
traveled to the University of
Massachusetts last Saturday. where

, they were defeated by CW. Post.

U. Mass., and Coast Guard. Once
again the key to the defeats was a
staggering combination of injuries
and forfeits.

in the CW. Post match. Albany
forfeited at l26 and heavyweight.
Against U. Mass. not only were
these classes forfeited, but two
more Albany wrestlers were forced
to default due to injury. By the titne
the team faced Coast Guard.
Albany wrestling coach Joe DeMeo
could fill only six weight classes
with healthy wrestlers.

Despite the dismal team showing.
there were numerous impressive in-
dividual performances. in the CW.

‘ Post match. freshman Vic Herman
at l90 used a punishing figure —
four body scissors ride to weaken
his opponent and eventually pin
him. Albany assistant coach Mike
Paquette, an All-American at
Union. observed: “When he
(Herman) gets those legs in on me. i

just try for a stalemate." Unfor-
tunately. the use of the leg ride ir-
ritated a previously injured knee.
and Herman was unable to compete
against either U. Mass or Coast
Guard. Rob Spagroli. another
freshman won two of his three mat-
ches at 134, using a Granby Roll in-
to :1 Peterson to gain reversals and
back points. Steve Cronin turned in
his usual strong performance at
l67. winning two of his three mat-
ches.

Albany team co-captain Mark
Dailey also won two of his three
matches. losing only .to CW. Post
in a match in which he wrestled up a
weight class to allow injured team-
mate Slcve Zuckcr to accept a
forfeit at l42. Dailey won his last
two matches competing in his
customary I42 pound class.
Dailey’s superior conditioning came
into play against U. Mass. as .he
scored four points in the third
period to win, 7~2. Against Coast
Guard. Dailey dominated the
match. pinning his opponent in the
second period.

his J " ed record to 13 straight
matches. defeating all three of his
opponents. Not one of these mat-
ches was ever in doubt as Hornbach
totally dominated all of his op-
ponents, winning by scores of l7-4.
l7-(7. and 8-3.

DeMeo believes that Herman.
Dailey. Cronin. and Hornbach
could all qualify for the NCAA
Division III championships this
year. lie also believes that they are
all capable of earning All=American
honors at that tournament. The on-
ly things keeping the learn frotn
reﬂecting the ability of these in-
dividuals is a lack of depth...and an
abttudancc of injuries. .

The team travels to Fairleigh
Dickinson University tomorrow
night. and returns home Saturday
to face SUNYAC opponent Oncon-
In in their final borne meet of the
season.
