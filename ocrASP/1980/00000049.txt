Swimmers Keep Coach Amazed Wi

by Jeff Schadoff

“This team never ceases to amaze
me,” commented Albany men's
swimming coachRort White, as his
team extended their undefeated
season Saturday to ﬁve wins, han-
ding the visiting Bears of Potsdam
their fourth dual-meet loss in six
decisions, by the score of 57-56.

As the season closes its ﬁrst half,
the Danes show increasing im-
provements with gutsy perfor‘
mances and the intensity to win
tough meets. White mentioned that
“this team probably performs best
under pressure."

The ﬁnal score was not indicative
of the actual meet, for the final
event, the 400 yard freestyle relay,
had no bearing on the meet. The
Danes had enough points up until
the event to ensure the victory.

As the season progresses, White
and his swimmers can look nowhere
but ahead as they face stiff competi-
tion in upcoming meets with the
likes of New Paltz and Cortland.
“Division 111 swimming has some
real tough competition," White
said. Although it may seem a bit’

premature to look at the March
SUNYACs and possible Division
111 ratings, they seem possible with
Albany’s clutch performances of
late.

“There has never been at SUNY
conference team in the ratings,"
White said. “As far as I'm concern-
ed, no SUNY team has a shot this
year. The best team in the corr-
ference is Cortland. But even with
their depth it's not enough. Albany
State is a fine dual-meet team. We
’don't have the depth to make us a
Division 111 winner. We will trike a
few points at the SUNYACs in a
few events but more manpower is
the most important factor."

Potsdam, visiting Albany with
the distinction of never losirtg to
Albany, sported a mediocre 2-3
record. Potsdam rookie-coach
Steve Barnett discussed the meet
and felt that “the one-point dif-
ference wasn't that bad. It was’n
good indication of how these two
teams will do at the SUNYACs. To-
day's meet vitas similar to a chess
game in determining who was going
to put which swimmer in what.

    
 
  

coach Dick Sauers. “i think we
solved their zone pretty well, and
after we adjusted with our press, we
made them turn the ball over."
Utilizing varying zone defenses
exclusively, Utica held the Danes to
six points in the first 9:16 of the
contest, as Albany deliberately at-
tempted to attack the Pioneer
defense. Utica led l0-6,’ but a
Starrish drive and two consecutive
lob-pass baskets by Jones gave the

Danes a 12-10 lead, and they never -

trailed again.

"We like to use the lob against
the 1-3-1 zonc — we did the same
thing‘ against Potsdam," explained
Sauers. “We look for our two
postmcn down low, because there‘s
rnorcroom inside. Kelvin did rt nice
job."

“It's our 1-3-1 cracker," added
Jones, who tallied a season-high 17
points.

While thc Danes were building
towards their eventual 37-26
halftime lcnd, Ancrtrrn was a one-
tnan offensive force for the
Pioneers. Scoring 20 of his team's
26 first lmlf points, the 6-4 Arrcrunr
hit for 16 in a row. and
singlchandcdly kcpt Utica frorn be-
ing blown ottt curly. Arrcrtrrn was
ninc-l‘or-ll before halftime (15 of
20 for the game), guard Carlton
Bowen went three for six. The rest
of the Pioneers? A blistering 0 for
14.

"We didn't get off to a good
start," said Utica coach James
Spartttno. “Albany seemed a littlc
sluggish at first, so we would huvc
been it] good shape if we cottld have

gotten off to a good start. We had

the opportunity, but we let it slip
away. As far as Atrcrurn, he's just a
great player. He never played high
school basketball, but he's our
franchise."

“We were a little shaky at first —
I think we were too pumped up,"
added Ancrum. “We knew that
Alburty was rattkcd in the state and
the country, so we wanted to let
them know that they were in a

event. trying to out-move each
other. in the 'blink events‘ —— the 50
and 100 yard events — Albany was
a hair stronger. That made the dif-
fcrcnce.“

The Danes jumped to a 7-0 lead
as the 400 yard medley relay learn of
Stcvc Bonawitz, .loc Shore, Frank
Heter, and Kerry Donovan totally
ripped their Potsdam opponents,
beating them by over 10 seconds.
Boutiwitz’s time of 58.11 was good
enough to break the old record he
had for the lead-off backstroke
split. .

A great deal of credit has got to
go to Albany's "l-Z punch" in
some of their events. The 50 yard
free-style teamed Dave Zybala and
Tom Roberts. As it turned out the
two scored 1-2. “Dave is looking
real good and solid. He's definitely
Mr. Reliable —— reliable for his
amazing consistency." said White.

Students, Faculty Gain Support

by Sue Mllligan

it was a day for lobbying and
pressure politics as over 3000 SUNY
students and faculty gathered
yesterday at the Empire State Plaza
to launch a statewide effort to save

SUNY programs and staff.

Opening speakers, addressing
union members, students, and
legislative representatives, attacked
a provision of Governor Hugh
Carey's proposed 1980~81 budget
which will reduce state aid to
SUNY.

Carey is proposing a $12.3
million reduction in SUNY's base
budget. An additional $14 rrtillion is
being cut to encourage at SUNY-

“This would restrlt in the elimina-
tion of 2200 faculty positions and
over 100 academic departments."
said SASU President Sharon
Ward. Classes would be larger, stu-
dent serviccs would be fewer, and
the general quality of education at
SUNY would be decreased."

UUP, also reprcscnteed at the
rally, is particularly distttrbcd by
the increase in Buntly Aid to privtrfe

schools.
According to UUP President

will increase Bundy Aid by $20
million,. reaching a total subsidy of
$88 million. “in addition,

funded at $1527 per strident at
private colleges, compared to $838
per student in at SUNY senior col-

.lcge," said Wakshull.

“Intelligence is not measured by
wealth alone," added Wakshull.

Senate and Assembly leaders of
Higher Education committcs are of-
fering SUNY support, according to

their respective constituents.

"SUNY must never disappear I
from the budget table," said
Assembly Education Chair Mark
Siegel (D-Manhattan). “it has to be
among the first needs to be met."

He added that “if restorations of
the proposal cuts are made they
must be made for all sectors. There .
should be no special treatment as
has been the ease in the past."

northeastern primaries. Tuesday, it
brought him to the Albany
Thruway House on Washington
Avenue and a luncheon sponsored
by local supporters. '

While topics touched on by Mon-
dale ranged from Afghanistan to
unemployment, the keynote of his
address remained his experience —
three years in the White House with
Jimmy Carter.

He spoke of Carter as "a presi-
dent who's honest, who obeys the
law, and who cares and is compas-
siorrate and who is experienced.
Keep him there working for you,"
ire urged. “When you do. you get
something else: you get the vice
president along with him.”

While evoking an occassional
laugh is an important part of arty
candidate’s style, Mondale quickly
shifted from humorous anecdotes
to more serious matters.

The recent Soviet’ invasion of
Afghanistan lcd among these,
characterized by Mondale as “one
of the scariest things to happen
since World War ll."

He referred to Afghanistan as a
buffer state turned into a Soviet sat-
telite through a "brutal and unjust
invasion with no justification for
action.“ ,

Mondale emphasized the Soviet
suppression and denial of the
Afghanistan people‘s right to run
their government. “in doing that,
the Russian government doubled
their border on lran and Pakistan."
he said.

Mondale stressed that
Afghanistan is located in a very
str'tltcgic position, bordering the
Persian Gulf, “just a narrow little
dribble of water through which

two-thirds of the world's oil must

 

h. nu... . .

  

pass."

The vice president defended
Carter's embargo of the sale of 17
rtrillion tons of midwestcrn grain to
the Soviet Union.

“They had to see that there is a
cost to defying the rules of civiliaa-
tion," he said. “So now they're go-
ing back on those old starched diets
and then see if that changes
anything."

Extending his discussion of
foreign policy to the U.S. position
in the upcoming l980 Olympic
Games, Mondale took a firm stand.

“1 don‘t think on the hull of the
invasion of Afghanistan, we should
be sending American athletes to
Moscow, and I don't think the
American people do either."

Montlale does view
Afghanistan sitttution as n potential
threat to national security. As such,
he fully supports Carter‘s proposed
reinstatement of registration for the
draft.

“We hope we never have to
draft, btrt that's not the point," he
told his audience. “if things were to
become tough, we have to build up
our resources beyond those of a
volunteer army. The best way to
keep peace is to let them know that
we’re serious."

Mondale noted that Soviet forces
are thrce to four times greatcﬂhun
available American manpower.

“Once in a while, we have to
stand together to unite the civilized
world and deliver a real message
with meaning and significance," he
said.

Mondale culled forth a sense of
U.S. world dominance and power
in tltc face of the Afghanistan crisis.
