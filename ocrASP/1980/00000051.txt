(AP) An emergency Olympic
meeting of 23 European ministers
was called off after many of the

ministers said they were reluctant to _

meet, a committee ofﬁcial said.
The meeting. sought by Gerhardt

Baum. the West German interior

minister. was scheduled for Feb. 5

Qtin Strasbourg, France. it now is

unlikely'to be held until after the
Winter Olympics end at Lake
Placid, N.Y.. on Feb. 24, said
Georges Walker, the committee's
secretary.

“There was not enough of a co\n1
sensus." Walker said. “Some still
felf it was too early to have the
meeting. The situation is so political
that it is unlikely that many nations
would allow the sports ministers to
make a decision."

Elsewhere, Yugoslavia repeated
its intention to participate in' the
Summer Games. The question of a
boycott has not been discussed in
political forums. a government

spokesman said Thursday.

Milan Ercegan. vice president of
the Yugoslav committee for
physical culture. said a week ago
that “in the Games we see in this
turbulent world a horizon of hope
for the relaxation of tension. and
that is why we are giving full sup-
port. that the olympic‘Games be
held and not boycotted.” '

But Italian Premier Francesco
Cossiga saidr holding the Games
would depend in a “great part" on
the Soviet Union itself.

Cossiga said in an interview on
the italian state television network
that he would not like the Moscow
Games to be held “in the same
spirit" as the I936 Berlin Olympics
under the Nazi regime.

The~ italian National Olympic
Committee said Monday that italy
would take part in the Moscow
Games unless. the international
Olympic committee decided other-
wise.‘ '

Italian Olympic chairman Franco
Carraro said he would attend the
meeting in Frankfurt on Friday.

France, initially one of the staun-
chest opponents of a boycott. is
now in a frenzied national debate
over the issue.

Originally, President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing announced that
action against the Games was not
appropriate. The president.
however. said the government
would not interfere in any decision

- Allies Needed-Tb Battle Soviets

WASHINGTON (AP) The nation’s
top defense leaders said today that
the United States could not be
assured of beating back a Soviet
move on the Persian Gulf and
would need help from allies and
friends.

“We can’t assure you we could
win a war there." said Defense
Secretary Harold Brown, “but to
cast doubt on our ability to deter or
fight effectively is damaging and-
unnecessarily damaging to US.
security."

Gen. David C. Jones. chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. said
that “any military action carries
risks and uncertainties for both

sides. Neither could be confident of

the outcome."

Brown and Jones testiﬁed before
the Senate Armed Services Commit-
tee about the adminisliation's pro-
posed $l42.7 billion defense
budget.

The two officials were asked
repeatedly whether the United
States could carry throtrglt with
President Ctrrtcr‘s declaration that
this country would turn back arty
attempt by an outside force to gain
control of the oil-rich Persian Gulf
region. “The cotntnittrrcnt is to

Byrd. I-Va. “it would be a mistake
to assume a war bethcn the United
States and the Soviet Union can be
won by either side.” V

Byrd said Carter “may be talking
tough and carrying a little stick."

Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Nash..
who also questioned U.S. ability to

carry through Carter's pledge. ask-
ed whether the president had any
commitments from Persian Gulf
countries to help the United States
defeat a Soviet bid to gain control
of the region.

Brown said the United States has
had “indications” it could have ac-
cess to facilities in the region.

“i believe it goes without saying

'our abilty to defend a" region
depends upon the participation of
'the people in that region," he con-

tinued.

“Pm not speaking about their
military capability alone." he add-
ed. “i’m speaking about political
support from the people in the

region and their willingness to fight

as well as they can. be they,the
Saudis. the Omanians, the ira—
mans." '

Brown said. however. that only
the. United States “can offset a
direct Soviet attack."

Women Fighting or Business

WASHINGTON (AP) Women are
growing militant in their efforts to
start businesses, claiming that too
many loan officers discriminate
against them for reasons that are
emotional. not economic.

That message was heard loudly
arid often at the recent White
House conference on small
business.

The anger is founded on it set of
imposing statistics. Women ()Wll

percent of all gross receipts. But,
they make tip more than 50 percent
of the workforce.

“Women fact: the same obstacles
as all small business owners, only
it’s worse for us." says Betty Orrcll.
president of it Houston insurance
company.

The young executive talks firmly
and .slowly. “it‘s atutIIing how
many bunkers. subconsciously at
least, still say a woman's place is in
the home."

At lIlitin hearings across the

eotrntry. prior to the Wltitc House
conference, women cntrcpcncurs

testified repeatedly about being
discriminated against by govern-
ment and batik loan officers.

The Senate's select committee on
small business agrees.

Women lack ttcecss to capital and
tttitnngemcrrt skills. "llut, in addi-

' lion, they face further b‘arricrs im—

posed by socictul attitudes which
persist itr the business community,"
the putth report says.

“No legislation or executive
order can reverse those altitudes.”
it adds.
