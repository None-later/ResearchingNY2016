receive tnail for her clients, deliver
messages to them. and in case of
calls or surprise visits. will even act

The Fumris/ magazine predicts
that a variety of drugs —— based on
chemicals similar to naturally -— oe-
cttrrirtg brain hormones —— will pro-
bably be available by the end of this
decade.

The tttagaritte says that some of
these compounds will increase otrr
powers of concentration; others
should bring instant relief to irra-
tional “phobias”. such as fettr of
heights or fear of strangers; and still
others are liable to be “potent
mood elevator‘s'" capable of going
as “fits of pleasure" or "the
ultimate trip.“ -'

According to The Futurist, the
bases of many of these chemicals
has already been isolated and are
ctrrrcntly being studied.

channels but on the black market.
Mandell Says it will “Take

The annual nationwide survey of
college freshmen has found that this
year's class is more interested in
power, status artd making money
than was any other class in the
14-year history of the survey.

The poll of 190.000 first year
students was conducted jointly by
UCLA and the American council
on liducation. Nearly two-thirds of
those questioned — 62.7 perecrtt to
be exact ~— said tltal (quote) “Being
very well off financially" was one
of their ruosl important goals.

According to tlte interviewers.
fewer than 50 percent of the

Sly Moves

The CBS and ABC television net-
works are locked in a tight battle
for the number one prime time
ratings spot this season.

CBS is expected to have picked
up a few important points by
televising the super bowl this past
Sunday. But ABC is hoping to
recapture those points and more by-
offering exclusive TV coverage of
the winter Olympic games next
montlt.

CBS. however, won't be sitting
by idly when the Winter Olytnpics
begin. Instead. the network has an-
nounced plans to show the movie
“The Exorcist” - the first time
ever on TV —— on February thh,
the day the Winter Olympics open.
(‘llS will follow that up with “The
Estrrcist. Part Two" the following
night.

According to one observer:
“All(.“s' going to have a devil of a
time with that combination."

.Better with Age

Women over the age of 35 rate
por‘rtotu’apltt-i films higher than do
younger women.

At least. this is the result of a ran—
dom survey conducted iii the
Washington DC area by the adult
business report. a newsletter for the
pornographic industry.

According to the newsletter. ‘/
percent UI tlte older women inter-
\ic\setl liked X‘l'ttlctl rno\ies. eight
percent were indifferent. and l6
percent did not like them. 0f the
‘ women. only 40 percent

 

‘vonuger
‘liked porn flicks. 3r. percent “ch
irrdil'tetcrtt. and 21 percent didn't
like the X-I‘ateds. The older women
\lll\'L'_\L‘tl said they think films could
be imptot ed by adding more plot.
and love scenes “that look err—
joyablc. and riot like a ‘chore‘ ".
However. one 35-year-old subur-
ban bookkeeper said she thought a
better plot would be unnecessary
because she “wouldn’t be able to
concentrate on it" anyway.

Hush Pupplds?

How would you like to have your
shoes glued to your feel? It" yon
manage to make it to the let cert-
lury. that may just be how you wear
fool gear.

Psychologist Ernest Dichler, in a
book titled How People WiIILive in
the Your 2000, predicts that not on-
ly will the soles of shoes be glued on
to bare feet. but both men and
women will wear one-piece stretch
suits. or go practically nude with
their bodies pairith different colors
and designs.

What else does the next century
have irt store for us‘.’ Dichter
predicts that beds or chairs will fold
into floors or ceilings. to leave more
space. at the touch of a button; air
blowers will replace towels in borne
bathrooms; vacuum cleaners will be
replaced by electro-static air filters
which capture dust before it can set,
tle; and washing machines will be
replaced by ultrasonic devices that
shake dirt loose.
