War Two, the resiliency of the early Christians under
Roman tyranny, and Watergate are just three reasons
why one can never underestimate the power of individual
will.

I However, Aspects this week has chosen to defy com-
mon sense and we have printed a list of about one hun-
dred questions. which we would like you to answer and
return to us. Our intention in compiling this survey is not
to classify SUNYA students or analyze the individuality
out of each of you. Rather, our purpose is to have you
contmunicateto us, through this survey, what bothers
you and what pleases you. ' '

The questions cover a wide field ranging from politics
to sex to God. Answer all of them as honestly as you can.
This is not a test. No grade anxiety should be present. if
you have comments on the questions or if there is any
subject you wish to elaborate on please enclose your writ-
ten remarks with the survey. Just drop off the completed
survey and comments at the Campus Cénter information

The results will be published after February vacation.
Then we may not be able to define SUNYA students but
we may be able to describe what you’re about and who
you are, Stats all folks.
