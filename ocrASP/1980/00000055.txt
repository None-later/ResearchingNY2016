Friday Ob'so‘nior  ’

bitter Albany day had provided, was sinking
behind the South Mall. The wind blew from
the massive Capitol building, directing its
sharp needles toward the huddled humanity
standing, shivering. waiting.

The assembled rarely conversed-‘cold had
taken contfort 'and conversation from them.
Most had schoolbooks In hand. Some paced
to and from the comer. taking glances down
the hill toward the mightly D and H Plaza.
Each glance reminded them of the weather,
t. r the bank clock read fifteen degrees-not ln-
cludtng the wind chill factor. And each glance
swelled the frustration building within them.
The green chariot,-the starships
academia.-the Wellington buses-were gone.

An hour had passes. The students saw twa.
three. four buses stop at the Wellington and
proceed dOWn the hill. Hope beat in their
hearts each time--they would be saved. But
the buses would reach the foot of the hill, turn
right and never come back. '

The students gave each other quick looks of
desperation, but few dared talk. They knew

_something was happening. something they
could not explain. However. there were those
who were too shallow to comprehend what
was happening.

“Where's the goddamn bus." bellowed a
dark-haired guy with an accounting book
under his arm. 1*. girl added her gripes.

am now, flat on my back itr bed. lused to stare
at the light switch in my room and eventually it
would dissolve itito the wall. looking absolute
ly ridiculous as if I had never seen one before.
But then l was not in as dire straits as i find
myself today. You see. within a few days or
maybe a week. l'm going to be dead. l was
told only recently. it's not my daily stay of ex-
ecution. the chemotherapy treatments that

That's not it. it's the embarrassment Dying

situation. Nassau County loudmouth accoun~
ting majors and Japs would be left to freeze.

Another twenty minutes passed. and still
'nary a sign of a Wellington bus. Most students
could not feel their toes. fingers or ears. Some
fantasized that they no longer had toes. fingers
and ears. others simply stared.

"i wonder." said one guy, Undiscovered
Self text peeking out of his knapsack. “Where
did the Wellington buses go?"

The students all looked down the hill and
suddenly frantic music began to play.

DOOO-DOOO~DOOO-DOOO. DOOO-
DOOO-DOOO-DOOO

"it sounds like it's coming from the Well-
ington." said a bearded burly guy. "Hey look
over then“

A short. slight man wearing only a suit
crossed State Street and walked toward the
students.

"Look at that suit. And that funny thin tie. i
think they wore them in the early sixties." The
man came closer.

"l don't believe it." cried Undiscovered Self.

DOOO-DOOO-DOOO-DOOO. DOOO-

Rod began to talk as only Rod can.

"These ordinary students. waiting to attend
an ordinary class at a state school in upstate
New York. will encouter extraordinary cir-
cumstances which college has not prepared
them for. The Wellington buses go down the
hill. but they don't come up. This can't hap-
pen in real life. but we are on the Periphery of
the real and the supernatural."

Christianity. They told us since we were
children that heaven awaited us after we stop»
ped breathing. provided of course we had
proclaimed Jesus Christ as our Lord and
Savior. And then they deluded us with the no-
tion that at the very tnoment of truth. our lives
would pass mysteriously before us. as if this
final chance to evaluate our entire lives would
bring everything into perspective and
somehow console us. By the age of sixteen or
seventeen l had rejected all that Christian

"Quiet." said Undiscpvered Self. “Don't

"Wow. man." said RCO, "We're all In black

"it's an experiment." said Undiscovered.
“One of us is supposed to crack. First, the per-
