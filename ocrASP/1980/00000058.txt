He is gone. My brother who is named for
him said "Grandpa was the master." He was
always the center of attention. He was the
center of so many lives. What now? My
Aunt Norma said “This is what no one
prepares you (or. you're never prepared for
death." I saw my father. a powerful man.

and that was the closest to hell i have ever
come.

My grandmother found the jigsaw puzzle
finished-tn his room. He had finished it before

the results on his radio. He was delighted by
the gifts his children bought him the past few
years - a beautiful watch (his time was “always
correct"). a new color television.

He lovedmusic. Sarah Vaughan could make
him melt quicker than anyone. He enjoyed it
when his children or grandchildren would sing
even if: he'd say that “they couldn't carry a
tune in a suitcase."

There are also thorns of the roses that we
recall. How he always read the obituary col—

his name the day he didn't, My sister heard
him say once “This is paradise, when you die.

For Brian spasm...

My father was dying and l was eating Wheaties. No one had bothered to inform
me, so there i sat. fat and ignorant. eating Wheaties, while the most important per-
son in my whole world lay still. the last threads of his fringed life being slowly snip-
ped away.

For the rest of my life. I would hate them for not telling me. They had always
sheltered me. based on some ill founded logic they believed it was "better for me
not know certain things".

Actually. i should have known anyway. i remember the night he died so well:
my own body was in a state of anguish and I couldn't contrain my thoughts.

But i felt certain l was merely experiencing the rewards of a Weekend of devout
debauchery. after all. i had earned that pounding in the head and that queasiness
in the stomach.

i thought the Wheaties would help. They didn't. l wound up throwing up six
times before I could leave the bathroom with even faint hopes of not having to
return immediately. ‘

But in the back of my smoke filled head a thought occured. and l sensed this was
more than just a hangover. it meant something was wrong, ‘really wrong
somewhere, but where?

My father and 1 shared something 1 had always considered a little mystical.
sometimes it frightened me that two distinct minds could be functioning in such a
similiar way; the thought patterns, the associations. even those silly little mind
games you play when you're alone with yourself, were the same. We had that rap-
port (he liked to call it “rappaport” - a pun on our good friends and neighbors. Phil
and Jean Rappaport) that most people, if they're lucky, experience once. i guess
l'm one of the extra-lucky ones because 1 shared it twice.

But‘now dad's gone and so is Brian and l'm left to wonder what that says about
me. The two people with whom i found some answers to life's riddles and from
whom. as corny as it sounds, i learned the meanings of Words like love, humor,
and devotion. were suddenly swept away by life’s tu‘multuos current. leaving me
alone to battle mounting absurdities. -

Dad. you said the world was mine if I’d only learn to ask. Well. l'm asking you,
who needs it-who needs that icicle world with its gifts of thorns' if i haven't got you
to share it with?

As i choke down these soggy Wheaties.| feet that lump in my throat constrict and
-1 know that six times aren't going to be enough. As i rush to the bathroom with the

. taste of life’s phlegm strong in my mouth. 1 gag but nothing comes up. I realize that
even my attempts at regurgitation are useless. i understand now that l'm alone.
Dad. it's for you i dream those princess dreams and grab for that golden ring
each time it comes around. You missed, some joker pushed you too soon off your
painted pony and now its up to me to lean a little farther, to stretch a little more till i

11.. Logic Puzzle by Howard P. Alvlr. Pin!)

St. Martin‘s Press has two high quality books that go hand
in hand with two others of equal quality from Simon and
Schuster.

From the [allowing clues. can you determine for each
book. Its title. publisher. teaching method. and equivalent
course title?

1. Listed alphabetically either from A to Z or irom Z to A.
the four books are: lst. one by Simon and Schuster: 2nd.
the one that teaches through facts in contest: 3rd. the one
that gives theI mu .9 equivalent of Executive Decision Mak-
ing; 4th. the one ihs-l teaches through unforgettable anec-
dotes and insights into human nature. '

2. The two books from St. Martin‘s Press are unique: one
teaches through the facts in politics: the other is the course
equivalent oi European Geography.

3. James Hurriot's Yorkshire and Churchill and Eden at
War are insightful: however. one of the other two books
teaches through an ongoing needs assessment while the
fourth book gives the course equivalent of Philosophical
lilhics.

4 Information Please Almanac and Genetic Politics are
thoughtful; however. a third book is the course equivalent 01
Executive Decision Making while a fourth book by St. Mar-
tin's Press is the course equivalent of European Geography.

5. The book by Simon and Schuster that teaches through
facts In context is not the same book that is the course
equivalent of Research.

6. Genetic POIIIICS Is not the hook that teaches through un-
forgettable anecdotes or the other book that is the course
equivalent of Executive Decision Making.
