1) Is the S.A. ofﬁce really a responsible
student service organization. or is it a
lackadaisical, self-serving social club?

2) Is there at least average intelligence and
competence among S.A. ofﬁce members?

We certainly hope that the S.A. office is
capable of responsible. competent serve. but
the events which led us to write this letter do
compel us to ask. We can only say: S.A. GET
YOUR SHlT TOGETHER BEFORE YOU
DESTROY THE PLANS OF ANY OTHER

Get Off Your Ass

To the Editor: '

Tuesday was Save SUNY Day. To all those
people who participated in the day's ac-
tivities. I hope you found it a rewarding ex-
perience. Only through active participation
in the political system will peaceful reform
occur.

To those people who did not participate.
I'm disappointed in you. People have got to
understand the importance of being actively
involved in the events that affect your lives.
Apathy is what has caused this country to
deteriorate. not the Soviets or the Iranians.
but the Americans. who don't care ettough to
make sure that this country is run under tltc
direction of the people. Students at Albany
are apathetic. I asked people if they were go—
ittg to the rally and got a variety of weak ex-
cuses: “I’m going to sleep”. “I'm going to
work out”. “I can’t go". “I don't care".
etc. Students shouldn't be so concerned
about going to classes. because if these cuts
rctttaitt. that class may be cancelled. The time
to act is ttowl

People front Buffalo, Oswego. New l’altr.
‘and a ltost of other schools showed up in
‘ntass numbers. These people gave up an en-
tire dtty and went through borittg btts rides to
get lterc. Sonte of the Albany State students
wouldn't give up a couple of hours. If you
didn't participate. there will be a next linte.
Get involved in politics. itt your cotnnnntily.
in our educational system. Don't let other
people tell you ltow your life is to be run. It's
going to be a lottg semester. A lot of positive
changes can be made. but they only can be
made if we all get involved.

—- Kevin Quinn

Missed the Joke

To the Editor:

The piece about .lerry Brown's “sense of
humor" (ASP. Jan. 25) proved Jay Gissctt's
ignorance of campaign rhetoric. When
Erown responded to a student's question
about America’s role in the Mideast .sttying
U.S. involvement would be “serving coffee
and donuts”. he wasn’t being funny. Brown
was using humor as a tactic to avoid answer-
ing the student’s crucial question; about his
specific proposals for a Palestinian
homeland. Using wit. llrown lttred his att-
diencc into it trap. and the ASI”s reporter fell
rigltt itt.

America. we have the freedom of choicedlf
you don't like Disco music. Don‘t Listen To
ltl It's as simple as that. But getting rid of
Disco because not everyone enjoys it just
doesn‘t make sense. Maybe these people who
condemn DlSCO would feel ntorc at home in
the U.S.S.R. where there is no competition
and everyone only has one choice —- the
government's.

I do not understand why there is so much
controversy between these two music styles.
Nobody has to listen to Disco. nobody has to
go to a Disco. and nobody has to wear Disco
clothing. People have a choice — Shell or Ex‘
xon, SUNY or Boston U.. Sasson or Levis.
Rock or Disco. That is all there is to it -— end
of debate.

Absolute Trash!

To the Editor:

Last week an essay appeared in Aspects
which raised some serious questions in my
mind as to the purpose of your magazine. Is
it your intent to stir controversy or to test

whetlter people actually read your paper? ls
Conchita Rodriguez bent on proving to the
world that any "slut" who takes a creative
writing course and owns a dictionary of ex-
otic frttit can become an artful sltort story
writer‘! "The Morning After" was absolute
trash. a worse than poor effort and it degrad-
ed the integrity of your magazine. I‘ve seen
form of
ttttdcrgrottttd papers. ls this a fine University.
or is it a whoreltousc‘! I wonder to which Ms.

finer efforts itt the lowest

Rodriguez belongs.

I've followed Aspects for it while ttow. The

editor. Stu Mutrttnga, deserves a lot ofcrcdit
especially for his end of tltc decade issue

Aspects of Ilte 70's. [int 1 wish you guys

wottld try to be consistent.
l’.S. — Conchita Rodriguez is an nppttll
ittgly poor excuse for a pseudonym.

Interpreting The Good Bok ’

'Ultimately you can listen to only one thing, not your president, not your misguided
leaders. save a few. not the communists or the socialists or the republicans or the
[democrats but you must listen to your own heart, and do what it dictates. Because
your heart is the only thing 'which can tell you what ls right and what is wrong. And
'qfter you have found out what you think is right and what is wrong, then you must
I know that you can say yes to what is right and no to what is wrong. And you young
men, for instance, if you feel that to kill is wrong and to go to war ls. wrong. you
have to say no to the draft. And if you young ladies think it is wrong to kill. and war
is wrong. you can say yes to the young men who say no to the draft. Because it Is not-
rhe leaders and the dictators, it is not god who is golng to get us out of the bloody
mess we are in. It is only you and only me. _ Joan Baez
It seems fairly evident at this point that the majority of world citizens are the vic-
tims of the insanity of insane leadership. Observing current presidential candidates
here in America. for example. one can see the rut of a Catch-22 emerging. The desire
to run American in its current state. on its obvious self-destructive path. Is practical-
ly a declaration of the continuation of such a path. For we have so wrapped our
government in suffocating. alienating bureaucratic red tape. that even the most en-
thusiastic. altruistic or candidates (if there was such a candidate) could not only
never win, but if he or she did, there would be virtual total ineffectiveness.
Therefore. one can logically conclude that the future of America. and the world for
that matter, lies not in government. but in us. the people of the planet. Then. con-
sidering the fact that most people refuse to realize this simple truth. hope for the
future dies. '
Think of war. We can even go so far as to say that we have the right to murder
, each other is such a fit of insanity inclines the murderer and the murderee. But do we
have the right to destroy innoccttt animals. and green fields. and seas. and skies. The
fall of western man actually stems from a complete misinterpretation of the Bible.
We were told by god that we were being given dominion over the entire planet.
because of our intelligence. However. does dominion imply control and abuse, or
does it imply using our intelligence to preserve and insure the harmonic continuity of
‘the world we have the ability to control. and be a part of it?

So if yott want to get religious about the world today. and think about why our
god itt heaven cottld let this happen to the man ltc created. then start reevaluating
- our role in the world. as handed to us by our god. who as it says on the money. we
' trust. '

And as far as war goes. I don’t recall anything in The Book giving any sanction to
it whatsoever.

400 For Coach Sauers
