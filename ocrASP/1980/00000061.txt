oomey':

(AP) Too bad old Avery Brundage
isn’t still around —- he Wouldn’t
have stood for the current Olympic l
crisis, insists Bill Toomey. one of '
America’s most celebrated Olympic
heroes.

“No country would dare in-
terfere when Avery' was president of
the 10C." said the former Olympic
gold medalist. world record-holder
in tile decathlon and member of the
US. Olympic Committee for eight
years.

“The movement had clout then.
it had stature which it seems now to
have lost. People are jerking it
around. Brundagc not only ruled
the 10C with an iron hand but. as a
former athlete himself, he had a
feeling for the athlete.

“He knew athletes got dirty.
Critics accused him of beillg stuffy
atrd unrealistic but he had all
idealism which he never corn-
promised. He was strong and ill-
tlexible. That's what we need to-
day." .

Toomey. 4]. was ill Philadelphia
today to undertake a new sports
role as executive director of the

AAU Masters Sports program. aim-
ed at continuing competition for
athletes past their' prime. including
swimmers over 25. and track and
field specialists ill the 30 to 40 age
bracket.

The project is sponsored by Penn
Mutual Life.

Since 1968. when Toomey
outperformed bigger and stronger
rivals at Mexico City Games to win
the rigorous lO—event test; he has
been active in the Olympic inove-
mcnt. traveling to more than 50
countries for the Peace Corps. do-
ing some History and English
teaching and serving orl the Presi-
dent's Council for Physical Fitness.

"First of all. i back the presi-
dent." he said. referring to Carter's
threat of all American boycott of
the Moscow Games if Soviet troops
remain itt Afghanistan. “1 don’t
like it, but i think it's the only
avenue open to patriotic citizens.
Otlr country gets priority over
selfish interests.

“My feeling is that Brtllldagc
would have jtttttpcd ill before tilis
alld made a firm decision.“ Brun-

Olympics Need Brundage

'dage. who served as [DC head from

1952 through 1972, died in May
1975 at age 87. He' left indelible
ﬁngerprints on the Games.

“i recall talking to Brundage a
few years ago about some of the
poorer countries l visited with the
Peace Corps," Toonley recalled.

“ ‘We‘ve got sonre money from
TV.‘ he said. ‘Maybe we ought to
use it to help them build up Olym-
pic teanrs.' Brtlndage gave the
Olympics visibility -—- he made them
an important organization."

A Stanford graduate with what

he termed mediocre skills. Toomey V

worked hard to master the
decatltlon. He went to a
psychiatrist to overcome a fear of
the pole vault bar. He ran. jumped
and threw for hours at a tinle.

Once he corllpetcd irl all event ill
Iran to celebrate the shab's birth~

“I‘ll never forget it." he said.

ABC ’8 Superstars Rising Again

(AP) While CBS anti NBC arc battl-
illg tlrldcr thc backboar'ds on Silli-
tlay afternoons with rival basketball
programs. the best citllcr network
can expect to become is No. 2. ABC
will will th.‘ day. just as it has for
tile past seven years. with its
popular prograln. 'l‘hc Superstars.
building all audience that has
beaten the conlbillcd ratings of tile
National Basketball Association on
CBS alld college basketball on
NBC.

The Superstars, ill its eighth year.
is the brainchild of Dick Button.
president of Candid Productions.
This is the same Dick Button wllo
has tirade America care about. alld
even understand, figure skating.

Button became fascinated with
the question of who‘s the best
atllletc after he won his first ()lym-
pic gold medal in figure skating ill
1948. He was a high school seniorin
New Jersey at the time.

“There were 10 boys itr our class
alld seven of them were better
athletes than I was," said Button.
"I would have had trouble making
the five-man football learn. When i
got up ill baseball, the outfieldcrs
sat dowrl. I really didn‘t consider

myself all all-around athlctc."

Ycl a year Irttcr, Button “on tile
Sullivan Award, given annually to
AlliCllL l's hcst amateur athlctc.

'l‘llc Itlt'tt of a cotllpctitiotl to
decide 1 re bcst atltlctc lay dormant
whilc Button won a second Olympic
gold ill t‘)52. graduated front liar—
val'd University and then llanald
law School arld then had a short
CilI’L'L‘l‘ HS illl ilk'llll'.

“’l‘hc concept came back to me ill
l‘)tr2 when I saw a picttlrc of Lt]
Vilclla. the great dancer who started
otlt as boxer for the Merchant
Marines. The photo captured him
ill all incredible lcap and was cap-
tioned: ‘ls this America‘s greatest
athlctc.‘ ”

Meanwhile, Button had moved
illto the television production area.
llis (,‘andid Productions packagcd
’l‘llc Superstars concept and began
pcddlillg it to tile networks. All
three, including AB(' which llatl
pro btlskctball then on Sundays.
showed Btlttorl tllc door. ()llc high
network official told Button “it was
tllc dumbest idea cvcr," Button
recalled.

But, finally ABC accepted it
when Illc nctwol‘k lost out on its bid

for NBC basketball.

The Superstars “as an immediate
success. but it also created a new
category ill '|‘\’ sports. lumping all
ltort-tl'aditiorrttl sports and all cvcttts
not seen Iivc into thc salnc baskct.
critics called it trash sports. 'l'his
tcrnt lllakcs thc iittlc hair Button
has stand on cdgc.

“'l'llc Superstars is serious collt~
petition. Our concept is putting
athlctcs against each other." But~
totl said. “All we're doing is
populari/illg thc dccathloll ill an
entertaining way."

The Superstars formed pits top
athlctcs against each other btlt not
ill their specialty. The cvcllts are
tennis. swimming. rowing. golf.
