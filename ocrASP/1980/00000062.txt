Dane Swimmers Maintain Undefeated  “I '

Beat Union For. Sixth Win

by Jeff Sehndoff

The Albany State men's swimm-
ing team beat a mediocre Union
squad Wednesday night by the
score of 73-40. The score was not
indicative of the actual meet. for
most of the Dane swimmers were
swimming out of their usqu events
due to Union's lack of quality
swimmers.

0n the evening, the Danes took
to first place finishes of the 13
events. Since all Albany entries had
unfamiliar names. the times did not
have record-breaking caliber. but
the Danes kept Union in check all
evening. never losing from the
opening event.

One of the true bright spots was
the diving event. Bill Derkasc’h had
no problem, capturing both the one
and three meter events. "He was all
fired up tonight." said diving coach
Bruce Sicklcs of Derkasch. who
gave the crowd some excitement
with his one meter optional dive
that he perfected for the meet — a
forward, two and one half twist,
somersault, pike position with a 2.6
degree of difficulty. The judges
gave Derkasclr scores of six and one
raIf, six and one half. five and one

 

half. “I knew it before he even hit
the water, mentioned Siekles.

Jeff Goldberg fared well in the
competition. taking third in both
events, missing second place in the
optional one meter event by .95 of
one' point. Nonetheless, Goldberg
has been improving rapidly and is
showing rival divers that he is tough
competition. Upcoming Goldberg
dives include a reverse. one and a
half, somersault and a front dive
with two twists.

Joe Shore swam the 200 yard but-
terﬂy and the 200 yard freestyle for
the first time. and still took first
place in both events with very coni-
petitive times; "Hc's truly
unbelievable. You can't ask for
much,more from a guy like Joe."
said Albany swimming coach Ron
White.

Steve Bonawitz, also swimming
races not in his usual repertoire,
took ﬁrst place in the 200 yard in-
dividual medley and first in the 500
yard freestyle. “Steve is a swimmer
with amazing qualities, and to see
him win those events just goes to
show you his amazing versatility,"
added Wirite. .

deal of skill in winning the 50 yard

freester along with the 200 yard
breaststroke, both events not his
specialtnyetcr also took a close se-
cond to a teammate, Kevin Ahern,
who edged him out at the wall in the
100 yard freestyle.

Many of the “unheralded” swim-
mers on the squad gave the teanithe
drive they have becn‘gctting in win-

ning the big meet. “Credit must be ‘ '

given to Steve Ellenbcrg. Dave
Motola. Kerry Donovan, Kyle
Welch. Jeff Farkas, Steve Otruba.
Ed Pierce. Jim Colgan and John
Docrner — for they were very in-
strumental in this win," com-
nrented Heter.

“This team is so versatile. In the
past we had just specialty swim-
mcrs, but the more I see this team
the more I give them the credit they
deserve. They are achieving cham-
pionship caliber because of this ver-
satility,” said an exuberant White.

The Danes’ record stands at an
undefeated 6-0 with the all-
important next meet at hand. The
Danes welcome Hartwick College
and SUNY New Paltz to University

p.m. in what will prove to be one
exciting tri-mcet.

Women Cagers Notch Fourth Win

by Lori Cohen

Women’s varsity basketball at
Albany is a young program. with
tnarry tips and downs. Tuesday
night’s will over the College of
Saint Rose, 51:44, proved to be the
beginning of a large up for the
women. “In today‘s garlic we final-
ly put things together. The ball just
started to fall into the basket. We
have not been able to buy a basket
in the past games. We also decided
to start playing twenty minutes and
then take a rest at halftime. instead
of playing three or four minutes of
good basketball to catch up. We
Wanted to be able to stay out in

coach Amy Kidder commented dur-
ing half time.

harder." This whole season has
been a bright spot for the coach and
her players, as they raised their
record to 4-6.

Chris lichrens yelling instructions
front the bench, the women played
fine basketball.

Luanne LaLonde, a 5~9
freshman, lead all scorers with 20
points, lit in the first half when the
score was 28-17, with Albany
leading. LaLonde had scored 14 of
Albany’s first 22 points. She was
consistently fed inside by Nance
Halloran, who also had a fine day.
Along with 6 points, Halloran ran
the offense. handled and stole the
ball, and handed out numerous
assists. Cheri Thuotte played a fine
game defensively for the Danes.

The big problem with Albany is
one of aggressiveness. Kidder talk-
ed about a drill they have been do-
ing all week. “They have not been
as aggressive as they should, so we
did a drill called ‘Anirnal Ball'.
Anything goes, it is two against one
and you cannot dribble. It is sheer
physical abuse. We were more
agrcssive today, the drill helped a
lot. Yet we still are having problems
also getting a good number of WbOUHding. We are "01 boxing
steals. Mary Anne Clrylinski and out enough."

The Albany State men's .I.V.

they crushed an inferior Skidmore

and two steals by the visitors put
them ahead 6-2. "We were really
flat." said Cornell of the early go-
ing. But nftcr a Skidrnorc timc-out.
the Danes implemented a full—court
press. reaping three consecutive
steals. and seven points on 42
seconds, as Albany took the lead
for good on a three-point play by

That was it for Skidmore. Albany
kept pulling away, more than
doubling their opponent's score by
halftime. leading 47-2l. The Dane
advantage never fell below 2|
points in the second half. and ex»

ninute.

"I don’t think they (Skidinore)
were the best team we've played,"
said Albany |.V. ltcnd coach Steve
Kopp. "I knew they were probably
one of the wenkest tennis on our
schedule," he continued.

Dcfensivcly. it was the best game
of the season for the Danes in the
points allowed aspect. Skidmore's
total was the lowest amount scored
against the jnyvccs since garlic three
(5‘) by Colgate). With regards to the
visitors' three big scorers, they ac-
counted for only 36 points, with
John (ilickmrin topping the trio
with 15.

Another bright spot was the luck
of fouling by Albany, who commit-
ted only lo infractions (compared
to 28 against RH), No Dime player
was in serious foul trouble.

Albany travels to RM on Snimu
day for u rematch of last weekend's
contest. KUDD stated that he
wouldn‘t make :ur)‘ drastic more‘. in
preparation for the game. but
