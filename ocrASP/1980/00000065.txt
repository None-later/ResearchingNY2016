Acting First Deputy of Banks itt
New York State Ernest K'ohn said
there are marry of reasons for such
delays. “but we normally do not
comment on tltose reasons.

“There are certain requirements
that branch applications mu5t
meet." he said. adding that a delay
may be a result of an incomplete ap—
plication review. He did not at-
tribute the delay to any conflict
with Marine Midland.

The Moneyrttatic.does not need
state approval to be installed. said
McGarvey. The approval is needed
only to turn the ntachine on. "a
simple ﬂick of a switch,” Ire said.

McGarvcy. however. labelled
Marine Midland's Natiortal Charter

an “end run" to” get around the im-
passe with the State Department.
Zahm said UAS “used every

. avenue we possibly could" to get
'approval from the State Depart-‘

ntcnt. He said he feels “progress is
being ntade now'." referring to the
recent National Charter approval.

Barnes said the introduction of
the Moneymatic.macltine to the
SUNYA campus, a $32,000 invest-
ment, has brought Marine Midland
“better than a couple of thousand
accounts." although a specific
number would be impossible to
determine.

He added that until the m chirtc
is turned on. students have the
alterrtative of usingthe Motteyrttatic
machines on Western Avenue or
Wolf Road. He said he hopes for
quick approval by the Comptroller
and lie “looks forward to scrvittg
the SUNYA community.”

In addition. minor deficiencies
are taken care of by the
$I5.000-l8.000 Public Safety
Budget. “Mostly this replaces sup-
plies." Scharl said.

But corrections involving a great
deal of money are ttot made so easi-
Iy. according to Scharl. “We rttttst
request funds for construction or
rehabilitative purposes.“ he said.

Requests are tirade to the Office

according to Scharl.

Art emergency generator system
for fire alarms will be installed by
this summer on the uptown cant-
pus. Presently there is no back-up
system for the ﬁre alarms if there is
a power failure, Scharl said. “Once
the ttew system is installed.” he ex-
plained. “fire alarms will run on the
generator automatically."

ltt addition. sntall vents will be
installed throughout the uptown
quads by April. he said.

On the downtown quad. a fire
suppression system will be installed
itt Brubaclter's kitchen for grease
ﬁres. Scltarl said this should be in-
stalled by next fall.

Plug-in smoke detectors costing
over $l5.000 will be ittstallcd by

Management Intern
MBA Program

This outstanding educational plan involves six months
of classes; followed by a six-month internship of
paid professional work experience; then nine more
months of classwork.

The internship concept. which Northeastern pioneered.
gives you practical. real—world experience in your own
field of interest. It helps you pay for your education.
And it often leads to important contacts for the future.

Classes begin in June and January.

the smoke detector project would

might think. .

And you don't have to just rely on your locht
newspaper to find them. Because this spring.
Ford's Insider magazine will feature an

entire issue on how and where to find summer
employment.

There will be information on government
jobs, including tips on taking the Civil Service
exam. Articles on overseas jobs, too. Intern
and co—op programs in private business. Jobs
workin’ on the railroad and other outdoor

the money they have. Scharl said he
is most concerned with dorms

rather than academic buildings.

“The dorms are where accidents
statistically occur most often. So
when we’re forced to choose bet-
ween allocating money for a quad
or for art academic building. we
pick the quad."

“Because we are forced to make
choices. certain violations are not
rectified," according to Scharl.

As an example. Scharl cited a
violation concerning a theater cur-
tain. “Recent codes mandate a
special theater stage curtain able"
to drop down automatically in the
event of a fire." he said. "and we
are warned every year. But it's a
very expensin thing. and I'd per-
sonally rather put the $30,000
somewhere else."

Scharl said tltere is no clause
which says corrections ntust be
rttade. He emphasized that tlte
panel cztly makes suggestions.
Sticrcr said “the purpose of the
panel is to Itelp us deterrttitte
priorities."

Scharl said tltcre ltave been
“relatively few" fire incidents on
catrtptts. “()It sure. there have bcctt
rttinor incidents such as wastebasket
fires and fires caused by candles.
lrnt ltrckily tltcrc have been no mn-
jot ptoblertts. We haven‘t ltad arty
major injuries or problems.“ he
said. I

“If you look deep enough. you
could always find violations."
Scharl suid. “Itut I really don't
think lIlt' campus is hazardous.
'I'hctc are a another of safeguards
ltlkt‘ll across the czttttptls'.”

" I he buildings are really safe."
he added. “'I'Itc only problem is the

said Wharton.

“Having raised trtitiott last year.
it would be unfair to our students to
raise it again this year." he added.

The (‘Itancellur ltas asked for a
five-year overall plan which would
call for tire University to “reassess
and reorder its program priorities."
