African'Dtsposal

American companies have ap-
parently come up witlt a new
tnethod for disposing of their
highly-toxic industrial wastes: they
are planning to ship the poisons
overseas for burial irt third world
countries.

The U.S. State Department says
it is concerned about this cottcept of
dumping American wastes
overseas. predicting tirat it will lead
to anti-American otttcries front
third world nations.

According to TItr' New York
Titties. the disposal of indttstrial by-
products snclt as arsenic and other
cheruicals has become increasingly
difficult in the United States. partly
in respottse to the waste scandal at
New York's Love Canal.

The Times says tnany American
elterttical waste firms are finding
tltat foreign nations have waste-
bttrial standards which are tnttch
less stringent titan tltose irt the
Uttitcd States. in additiott. the
overseas nations are said to he eager
to attract American companies to
their shores. .

Among the ttatiotts said to be in—
terested in offering chetnical dump-
ing areas to U.S. firms are Chile
and the African nations of Sierra
Leone artd Liberia.

One recent State Department
tnenro predicted that if U.S. firms
dispose of their toxic wastes irt
Africa, African nations will even-
tually join together to "condemn
the U.S. for dttmpirtg it’s wastes iii
the black man‘s backyard."

Tripping Treatment

A psyehadelic trip may be just the
thing for an upset stomach. At least
that‘s what researcher Elor
Rodriguez of the University of
California at irvirte is suggesting.

Rodrigue/ says that as well as
having mind expanding properties.
certain psychoactive plants may
also be the perfect cure for a variety
of parasitic diseases. including
antoebie dysentery.

Rodriguez says that the lndians
of the Ania/on in South America
may have preserved their own race
by eating toxic psychoactive plants
which ittdttced vomiting aml helped
cttre parasitic diseases.

Rodrigncl says that the lttdians
may not have been aware of the
medical benfits of the psychedelic
plants. btrt sensed an improvement
itt physical health after takittg them,

Rodriguez. who lived with an
elderly tncdicinc man among the
Katnsa inrliaus of tire Amazon.
quotes the medicine man as saying
that he had takert psychedelic drugs
since he was six years old and that
the drugs. “make you feel good irt
the head. .wltich makes your body
feel good."

Rotfrigue/ is currently studying
the psychoactive i/lr’t'ur‘ root lakctt
by the Ania/on lndians which is
also one of the most effective
substances known in combattiug
parasitic disease.

education predicts a five to fifteen
percent drop in college enrollments
over the next two decades.

According to the study, the in-
cieasing shortage in students will
force colleges and universities to
contpcte even harder to enroll them.

The study predicts that students
who choose to attertd college will —
in the stttdy’s words — “BC
recruited more actively. admitted
more readily. retained more
assiduously, couttsclcd ntore atten-
tively. finance tnore adequately and
taught ntore conscientiously
and the curriculum will be more
tailored to their tastes."

White students may be more
pampered in the years ahead. the
report predicts that budget cutbacks
artd other restrictions will make the
jobs of teachers attd administrators
more difficult ttttd less desireablc.

Meat Loaf. Again?

Fans of Meat Loaf. CBS
Records‘ ZOO—pound superstar. will
have to wait until new spring for his
long overdue follow up to his hit
albutn “Bat Out Of Hell."

Merit l.oal' had recorded an l..l’.
which was to ltave been released last

fall. but a dil fercnce of opinion hct- -

ween the singer and his
songwriter. Jim Steinman. has
resulted in the completed albtrtn be-
ing shelved.

Apparently Meat Loaf was not

while Steininan thought they were
all very good. The end result was
that CBS Records has decided to re-
record the L.P.. using Jim Stein—
man’s voice. Meat Loaf will record
yet another album.

Meat Loaf will go back into the
studio this spring with a1 new pro-
dtreer arid record an album with all
new songs.

The two albums by Steinman and
Meat Loaf will be releasedrat the
same time. and the pair plan a joint
tour in the late spring to promote

both L.P.‘s. ‘

Take 3 Tan

Americans‘who want that tan arid
ruddy look may soon be able to
maintain a full-body tan the year
around without sun bathing. or
even without exposing themselves
to sun lamps.

That‘s because a Canadian firm
will soon begin marketing pills that
allegedly cattse the skirts of its users
to turn tan in color.

1,.aboratoirc Bio-Chimique has
announced its intentions to begin
offering its “Orobronze”,pills in
the United States.

The U.S. Food arid Drug Ari-l

ministration has reportedly tested
the tattrtittg pills. arid found that
they contain a food-coloring agent
known as “Canthexanthine." Ac—
cording to the makers of tire pills.
lltc ingredients are perfectly safe.
The same chemical is said to be
widely used for coloring butter and
cheese.

Users of the tatttting pills are told
to take four tablets a day for two
weeks to establish a good tan. and
then two capsules a day after that to
tnairttaitt that bronze look.

A box of tit) capsules is currently

 

:Pnge Nlrie .
selling over-the-cotinter in Canadh_
for about $29 (dollars). They will

allegedly be ayallable to Americans
within the next six months.

Braid Craze

The movie “10" may be doing
even better at the beauty parlor
titan it is at the box office.

Pacific News Service reports that
some Los Angcles hair stylists are
getting up to five hundred dollars a
shot to turn women's hair into
dozens of thin braids — called
“cornrows” — decorated with
beads and feathers. .

The hairstyle has been popular
with American black men and
women since the mid-seventies. But
when [30 Derek sported it in the
movie “10.” it became a nation-
wide hit for women.

Keeping the cornrowcd head
clean can be ticklish. Bo Derek

’ simply soaked her head in a sinkful

’of alcohol and witch hazel. One
woman says site cleans her head
with a toothbrush. and another
prefers a water pik.

There's also the problem of
baldness. doctor Michael Reed at
the New York Uriiversity hair clinic
says that pulling your hair so tight
often "results itt temporary hair
loss.“

Nature’s Way

Breast-fed babies are less likely to
becotne fat adults.

At least that's what Tufts Univer-
sity mttritionist Jean Mayer claims.
According to Mayer. the breast fed
baby cannot be overfed because the
mother can‘t dclertttitte how ntuch
milk is left in the breast. and
therefore can't force her infattt‘to
drink the last drop.

Mayer says in breastfecdittg the

that the tncaltimc is over.
