With Three Wins For Week

by Mike Wllllamsop

The Albany State varsity wrestl-
ing team enjoyed a very successful
week. defeating three of four op-
ponents. As usual. forfeits played a
part in the outcome. but for once.
they were in Albany's favor.

On Wednesday. Albany defeated
Fairleigh Dickinson University by a
score of 32-17. The match included
five forfeits. three by FDU and two
by Albany. Of the five matches,
Albany won three. tied one. and
lost only one. Dane wrestlers scor-
ing team points ittcludcd Seth
Zamck. who tied his opponent at
118. and Mark Dailey who won by
fall at ISO. Lenny Guzman at 158
and Steve Cronin at 167 both
defeated their opponents to end
what proved to be a rather short
matclt as the last three weight
classes were forfeited.

On Saturday. Albany hosted a
Quadrangular meet against

_Clarkson, Onconta. and Central

Connecticut. Albany was victorious
against Clarkson attd Oneonta. but
was defeated by a strong Central
Connecticut team.

The Clarkson match was
dominated by forfeits, as only four
often matches were actually wrestl-
ed. Albany freshman Rob Spaguoli
won 11-3 at 13410 give Albany four
teartt points. This. plus five forfeit
victories gavc Albany an easy 34-12
team victory.

Albany's next opponent was
Oneonta. Albany jumped to a 12
poittt lead as Onconta forfeited at
118 and 126. Spagnoli wrestled to a
2-2 tie at 134 to maintain this 12
point margin. Dailcy and Dave
Slraub won at 142 and 150. respec-
tively, to widen the margin to 18
points.

At 158. Guzman was narrowly
defeated by last year's SUNYAC
most valuable wrestler Ron Van-

Albany Student Press

Noy, 7-5. This was to be Oneonta's
only victory as Cronin won at 167.
Paul Horttbach tied at 177, and Vic
Herman won at 190. As usual.
Albany forfeited at heavyweight to
contplctc the scoring 28-13.

The final match of the day was
against Central Connecticut. and
Albany came out on the short end
of a 33-15 score. The match was
much closer than the score would
indicate. with the outcome beittg
undecided until after the 167 pound
match. despite Albany's forfeiting
two weight classes.

The closeness of the contest was
the result of pitts by Mitch Litkc at
158 attd Hornbach at 177. Both
wrestlers totally dominated their
opponents on the way to their
respective victories. Spaguoli pro-
vided the rest of Albany's points
with a 5-1 victory at 134.

The weeks activity upped the
teams record to 8-9 for the season.
In addition. Hornbaclt remained
undcfcalctl. running his record to
1601. The learn travels to Western
New England University tomorrow,
and will he an RF] on Saturday.
