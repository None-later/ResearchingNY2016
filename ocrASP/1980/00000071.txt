J.V.'Tops RPI For First R‘oeryd’Wi-ni 0.

by Bob Bellal‘lore

TROY. N.Y. —— “Saturday. it'll be
a different game." That's‘wbat RPI
head .I.V. basketball coach Bill
Tweedy said on January 26. after
his team had lost to the Albany
men‘s .I.V. squad. 78-67. Well. last
Saturday. it was a bit different.
Albany‘s Mike Gallo only scored 16
points (he had 26 against RPI the
last time). but Mike Gaines hit for
20 as the Danes finally found suc-
ccss on the road. and beat the
Engineers 65-6l, Saturday after-
noon arctlre RPI Field House.
Albany's record is now an irri-
pressive IU-Z.

A superb Albany rnan-to-rnan
defense once again shut down the
Engineer front litre. Lance Tracey
(21 points in the last Albany-RPI
game) was held to a meager four
tallies by Dunc forward Ray Ed—
wards. and 6-8 center 'I'om Truax
netted ottly eight. l’cte Doneckcr
led the RH scorers with 1') points
(but only seven in the second half,
and nine on free throws).

As was the case in Albany‘s three
previous contests, the Danes fell
behind early. RPI led by as much as
seven points, 16-9. after seven and
one-half minutes. Ilut. cappirtg off
a nine poirtt Albany streak, Dave

  
    
   

  
    
   

Hardy converted a three-point play
to knot the game at l6-l6. and then
‘nradc good on both shots of a one—
and-one situation to put the Danes
ahead. The Engineers tied the score
soon ‘after. but two Gaines free
throws gave Albany the adwrntage
for good.

The Danes maintained control
for the rest of the half. In the midst
of a stall which lasted 5:02. a
careless pass went off Hardy's
hands. and an ensuing RPI bucket
put them within three. A nifty
Gaines turn-around jumper from
the corner, at the buzzer sent the
game into the intermission with
Albany ahead 3I-26.

The Danes opened the second
half with a l()-(r burst in the first six
minutes. and ran off a 12-4 spree in
the middle of the period to bring
their lead to 55-4]. The difference
stretched to to in the final minute.

“I guess the outcome was; pretty
siruilarﬂ.’ corurncrrtcd Albany J.V.
head basketball coach Steve Kopp.
“We played pretty good defense."
This is true. as Donecker was the
only Engineer in double figures.
Albany captain Rick Cornell did a
superior defensive job on Truax.

- and kept him off the offensive
boards. “There is no excuse for
‘ guys that big to be outrebounded."
said an extremely disgusted
Tweedy. “That’s where the game
was lost — the battle of “the
boards." Kopp disagreed. “I'm not
so sure that was a big factor,"
noted Kopp, pointing out Albany
had 28 rebounds the_ day. not feel-
' ing that the total was too extraor-
dinary. ' /
Fouling was not a factor this
time. as no Dane was in serious foul
trouble. Gatt'o had four, but com-
mined the last infraction with only
56 seconds remaining. Albany also
shot Is for 22 from the foul line.
which is an improvement from their
earlier games.

Kopp was extremely relieved to
get that first victory away from the
friendly confines of University
Gym. “I was glad to win that road
game."

'I‘lte' Danes travel to Oneonta
tonight for a rematch with the Red
Dragons. whom Albany mauled
107-74 two weeks ago. “I’m a little
concerned about Tuesday’s game."
said Kopp. “They’ll be more ready
for us this time."

Late Rally Leads Indoor
Track Team To 65-62 Win

by Ken Cantor

‘ The men's indoor track tearu
resumed action Friday night. arid
staged a late rally that carried them
to a 65-62 victory over host R.P.I.
The victory was all the more int»
pressive because Albany had trailed
36-0 at one point.

“A damn good comebackl". was
men's track coach liob Munscy‘s
impression of the meet. He added.
“We were hurting in the field
events. We lost one of our top
jumpers in Ed I’roulx (who will
devote l'ull Iirrrc to teaching). With
this irr mind, we knew we had to
come up with a good all around cf-
I'ort to take this tough R.I’.I.
team." ‘

Iividently. this was quite true.
because R.I’.I. swept all the field
events. At that point R.I’.I. had
taken a 3M) lead in the meet. When
the running events started things
picked up for Albany. Ilill Mathis,
Bruce Shapiro. Mike Sayers and
.Iirn Roth came up with a strong ef-
fort in the 3200 meter relay. Mathis

was sturdy in the anchor position
for Albany. Scott James and Ismael
Cruz placed first and second in the
I500 meter run. “This was a very
crucial event. It cut R.P.I.'s lead to
3748 and put its right back into the
meet". stated Munsey. Two
freshmen. (.‘urt Demon and Mit-
chell Ilarvard. also played an im-
portant role by placing first and
third, respectively. iii the 400 meter
d a .s h . ' ’ '

Howie Williams placed first in
the 45 meter dash in 5.7. When ask-
ed about the team's outlook.
Williams replied. “Our team is very
strong and will be tough to beat as
we proved today. I think R.P.I. put
up a very good fight. btrr our run-
ners held out pretty good. Our team
is very young arid has excellent
sprinters on it.“ Ile added. “I hope
to cut dowrt the tirrrc on my sprin-
ting. I think I will bc able to do this
by improving my starting form.“

Shapiro took first iii the 800
