could itr\ol\'c the elimination ot'

()‘leaiy. SllNYA ztdrrrinistrarors
must begin looking at ways “to

“We're trying to ﬁnd ways to
save money other than cutting posi-
tions." ()‘l.cary said. He added.
however. that there have already
been many cuts in services. equip-
tirerrt, and supplies over the past
few years. and there is “only so far

Director of Student Affairs Neil

to rcdtrcc student services has made
him “frustrated and discouraged.“

“I‘m trying to think as creatively

Winter Carnival Failure:

Lack Snow, Students

Student apathy attd lack ol~ show were cited as reasons lot the rrtr-
sttcccssl'ul winter weekend. held l-ch. l-J. according to \\'irttcr' ('at’»
nival ('omrrtittee ('Itait .Icll' Stern.

“Winter weekend events were supposed to include an ice cream
social for area high schools. winter olympics. a dance marathon.
snow sculpture contests, a campus ccrttct' hallroorrr party. amt the
presentation of awards at the col'l'cchousc." Stein said.

Due to the lack ol‘ snow. the snow sculpture event was cancelled.
Only one winter olympics team captain showed interest iii the olyrtt-
pies. thus l‘orciug lllC'CVL‘tll to be elittiiuatcd. according to Stern.

lll addition. Stern said oitly two students \ll')\\cll up for the ice
crcartr social. even though tetr high schools said they would attend.

Stetrt also blamed the fact that this was the first witttct weekend.

He said tltc weekend was funded by 12 student organl/atiotis. In
addition. tlte administration pledged St 100 and HAS donated 5500

dollar irtcr se in the Student Ac—
