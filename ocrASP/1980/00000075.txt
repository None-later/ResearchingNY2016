Senior Class Resoundingly

Votes to Back ILG WU

by Lillian l’carsall

Tltc SUNYA Senior Class Coun-
cil ltas voted tmanitttottsly to
boycott Cotrell and Leonard. tltc
manufacturer of corttntencemcnt
gartttents. in support ot‘ the Interna-
tional Ladies (iarment Workers
Union (ll..(iWU), according to
Settior ('lass President Dave Wein-
trattb.

ltt a Monday ttigltt trteeting. the
council voted l7~l itt sttpport of ap-
proximately 50 Cotrell and Leonard
apparel workers on strike almost
continuously from Attgttst R.

Cotrell and Leonard, located at
472 Broadway. Albany. is charged
by the strikers with conducting an
anti-union campaign. Based on in-
vestigations ol' strikers charges. the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has issued a contplaittt of
unfair labor practices against the
cotnparty.

The (‘outtcil‘s vote was the result
of information tltey gathered from
knowledgeable sources. and a visit
to Cotrell attd Leonard on January
3t. Weitrtrattb said there was
“enough evidence to substantiate at
least boycotting for this year."

supported these charges.

The group also spoke to Cotrell
and Leonard's Vice President Atr-
tltorty Harden. ill a letter. Harden
denied all ttrtiott charges. He said
the company had not interfered
with union activities. that tlte
bttitdirtg was trot decrepit. and that
employees were not underpaid and
received benefits. When Weintraub
and the board members asked to .see
the building. Harden refused.

Earlier last month. two ILUWU
representatives. speaking for the
strikers. met with SUNYA ad-
ministrators. They sought
ministrative support iii a boycott of
Cotrell and Leonard caps and
gowns. which have been sold itt the
bookstore a number of years. Ad-
ministration ot'l'icials artd bookstore
management have since decided it is
ttot tltcir place to judge Cotrell attd
ttttiotr charges. aside front tltc
NLRll's complaint of unfair labor
practices.

The ttttiort charged that (birch
and Leonard's building was
“decrepit ", witlt poor ventilation.
a leaky roof. and inadequate l'irc
escapes. it is also alleged that
employees received low pay and Ito
bencl‘its. Wcitttt'ttttb attd the board
members spoke to pickctcrs. who

The bookstore. however, is offer-
ittg art alternative company. the
‘C.E. Ward Company of Illinois.
Ordering dates for CE. Ward are
March 3 to Marclt 28. and for
Cotrell and Leonard April 14 to
May 23.

Senior class president Dave
\Veirttrattb said the Cnlltcil finds the
bookstore alternate plan unsatisfac-
tory. They intend to encourage
Follt‘tl mairagcr Clary Dean to corn-
pletcly boycott the company. Wein'
trttub said tltat “even if there's no
_alterttate. l ltopc all seniors will sup-
port a boycott of Cotrell and

He ended his spccclt with the
