A team of researchers at a Mitt-
nesota Medical Center claim to
have discovered what may be a new
type of pain killer: Television.

Doctors at the Minneapolis
Children's Heath Center are cur-
rently rising television to help their
young patients relax and increase
their tolerance for pain.

According to Dr. Karen Olncss,
the physicians discovered that rlte
easiest way to nrake children tL‘lilV
was to have tltem think abotrt their
favorite TV program.

Says Olness: “This led us to
believe that children might be in an
altered state of consciousness while
they're watclting TV"

Olness says she plans to study the
brain waves at. tltc children to see if
their thotrgltt patterns actually
change while watching TV

V ZQI-AG EW

If the theory proves to be true,
says Olucss. rttost adults arid
children may one day use TV
specifically to increase their
tolerance for paitt.

The Carnegie Council reports
that U.S. universities now prodttce

That‘s at least cigltt times the

Double Standards

A Milan. Italy. television station.
which previously featured only
male contestants itt its sex quiz pro-
gram. is now including female eon-
testants.

In the original sex quiz shows. a
female performer was required to_
take off an item of clothing on
camera for each question the male
contestant answered correctly.

Now. allegedly to boost the
sltow‘s popularity. the Italian sta-
tion has introduced its lirst female
contestant. The outcome? The
woman succeeded in correctly
answering a long string of questions
about Napoleon while a male per-
l'ormcr dressed tip as the great

Why the sudden glamour fever in
men? Norman Darr, Executive
Director of the Men‘s Fashion
Association. says that women's
greater economic freedom has made
men more conscious of being a sex—
ual commodity. Says Karr: “A
woman today isn't going to be im-
pressed by a man just because he’d
make a good provider, especially if
he looks and smells like hell."
