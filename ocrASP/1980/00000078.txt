Gatesof
Delirium

John'ny won’t go to Afghanistan and Michael says he
has to. Bobby doesn‘t sleep at night and George doesn't
want to. What's the use, they cry. to plan a life, to want
firings: a degree, a wife, a family, a job, a house, a car,
the litany of things promised to us by the great God TVI,
and the folks at TRW working for a better tomorrow. and
our motor company Ford, and the revised edition of
American History For the Fourth Grade that guarantees
any boy or girl a shot at the Presidency. What's the use of
sitting through Accounting when tomorrow the green
card could come in the mail with a one way ticket to
World War III? What's the use?

Why can‘t the world realize? Let the Russians get their
kicks by slaughtering Moslean and making goulash out of
the arcane concepts. freedom. human rights. and most
silly of all, tolerance. We have nothing to lose in the Per—
sian Gulf, nothing but oil which we're running out of
anyway, and which has irreparany ruined the Gulf of
Mexico and increased the statistical probability that you
and I can look foward to Cancer in our middle age.
Beautiful. Bomb them anyway. What this country needs
is another war to get us out of this slump. More blood on
the hands of the people who brought you Vietnam, the
Pinto. the DC 10, the Firestone 500. and Three Mile
Island 'won't make a difference. After all if IBM and
General Motors could make bigger profit. why shouldn't
we sacrifice a leg. or an arm, or a brother. Most of us get
dividends anyway.

War is inevitable. it is Man's way, and the majority of
people who believe that write off the future because war
isn't a question of which field to meet at for an afternoon
of masculine sexual sublimation. We're talking end—o-
world. E.O.W. Don't think the Russians and us spent
more money than it would take to give every person on
earth a house in Great Neck with free food for life for
nothing. We have the capacity to make this spinning
green and blue Jewel a million pieces of broken hopes.

One thing is certain. There will always be a_tomorrow,
but we may not be here to see it.

The human race is just beginning. We. have so much
potential. Don‘t blow it on nationalism. America is a mere
name. Love people, Irate the hate which is built out of the
cesspool of non-communication. and confusion. and
fear, The future can be anything. but if we go to war we
cancel all bets. and the future becomes a threat.

Why should our generation suffer for the greed and ig-
norance and egotisticer power lust of those now pushing
the buttons? The events of the last few years have expos-
ed our leaders to be corrupt and morally bankrupt. Why
die for them? Live. so that tomorrow can be better. Live,
to fight for Mankind. and simple human decency. Live,
so that now, on the threshold between kidhood and
adulthood. We can IiVe free and grow in this beautiful,

 

precious earth. Live.
