Wom'enlcagérs Fall, 7 5-42

To Experienced Siena Club

by Maureen George
LOUDONVILLE — The Albatty
State women‘s basketball team
traveled to nearby Londonvillc
l'uesday night to face Siena (,‘ol-
Icgc. The two young teams battled it
out, attd Sietta. the more experienc-
ed team. “on 75-42, Siena‘s tcattt
consisted of all sophomores and
freshmen as did Albany‘s. with the
c\ccption of senior (‘ollccn l‘ltotnp.
still for tltc Dunes.

Despite tltc Albany
women‘s basketball coaclt Anty
Kiddcrwas pleased with her team‘s
performance. “Initially Sicnn took

settle,

its too lightly. The first few tttitttttcs
\te traded baskets and the score was
close." said Kidder.

Although Albany nctcr had the
lead. Sicna s\\ilcllcd to tlttttldtt-lllitll
defense curly itt the game. With ten
tttitttttcs lelt in the half Sicna open—
ed the game up. and led by ll)
lit-R. llttt Albany‘s tough Z-Z-l
defense wouldn‘t :lllo\\ Sit-nit to
break it open any more. and the
score at the cttd of the first half saw
Sicna lead, 36-24.

At tlte start of the second half.
Siena ('oaclt .loe llogan decided to
play it safely and pttt back itt his

starting five. Albany could not keep
up with the tough Division ll team
and Sicna began to break the game
open.

"We had a lot of trouble defens-
ing the baseline and their
fastbreak." said Kidder.

Mary Gaudrean and Vicki
Arotnando led all scorers with El
attd 20 points. Arottntntlo also pttll-
ed down seven rebounds. High
scorers for Albany were Lottattttc
lal,onde with to points and Kim
Boerncr with ll points. '

Kidder concluded. “It really
\Htsn't a bad game lot tts. We box-
ed ottt attd rebounded well."

The Albany team will be home

Olympic Donations Still In Question

NEW YORK (AP) — As the televis-
ed pitclt for money goes, “America
doesn't settd athletes to the Olympic
Games; Americans do." Attd
they’re still trying. despite President
(‘arter's threat to boycott the
Moscow Olympics.

ltt early and mid-January,
Americans were sending money at
“a furious rate" to fttttd the US.
Olytttpic team. says an analyst of
the US. Olyntpic Coitnnittee’s
fund-raising lgttres. But Alan
Sack, senior \ cw presidettt of Ilttb
Mail Adverliiing itt Boston, said
Wednesday that lie noticed sontc
slackening since .latt. 20. when
(‘arter said the Moscow Games
sltould be cancelled, postponed or
tttovcd il'Soviet troops aren't pttllcd
from Afghanistan by Feb. 20.

Attd Sack admits it's still too eat-
ly to tell ltow the boycott threat
hanging over the (iatttcs will affect
futttrc fund-raising efforts.
although 15. Ray Mueller. the

USOC's director of fund-raising.
says: “As ofnow, we're on target."

That‘s partially because
Americans didn't slow down wltett
(‘arter tltrcw up the catttiott flag
.latt. 4. ltitttittg at the possibility of
an Olympic boycott for the first
time. liven tltottglt polls reflected
popttlar opinion in favor of a
boycott. Americans settt tnorc
money to fttttd tlte U.S. ()lytnpic
learns during January 1980 than
they did during the idetttical period
one y'ar ago. Sack said.

Stick's company uses its cont-
ptttcr to tally private citizen dona-
tions to the US()(‘. which asked for
contributions front 750,000 in-
dividnals itt letters mailed last ()c-
tober. 'l‘ltat total was 35 percent
higher than the tttttttber of appeals
tnttilcd ottt itt October W78.

After subtracting the 35 petccnt.
the numbct of dottors last tttotttlt
increased by ()6 percent over
.lattttary l‘)7‘), wltile the antottttt of
ntoney taiscd iuntpetl 7‘) petccnt.

Still. tlte USOC appears itt good
shape for tltc tnottths tctttaittittg itt
this Olympic uttadrenttiutn. 'l'ltc
USOC is some fisltt-ll tttilliott sltott
of the $44 ntilliott it estitttated was
ttcedcd to cover the 1977-80 ()lytn-
pic period. The costs for tile actual
two ()lympic weeks itt February itt
Lake Placid and July itt Moscow
are expected to accottttt for less
tltatt It) pcrcettt of the budget —-»
$950,000 for the Wittter Games and
$2.4 tttillion for tltc Summer
Games. “Both will go above that,"
Mueller said. “There‘s the ltigltcr
cost of airfare attd everything else."

Sack said that logic would dictate
tnottey being witltltcld while an
American team's participation was
in dottbt. “But itt this business, yott
can't tltittk about what you would
do. You have to take yourself ottt
of the ltig Apple.“ lte said, adding
you base to go to America‘s
heartland to find the real public
pulse."
