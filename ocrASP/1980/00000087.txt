Dane season Falls ’0n 

 

Albany Falls To Hartwick;
Shocked In oneonm, 63-62

by Paul Schwartz ~

The energy spent in maintaining their furious com-
eback proved to be too heavy a price to pay by the
Danes last night. After the nationally ranked, Division
[I Hartwick Warribrs roared to a 26-10 lead, Albany
slowly battled back, closing to 30-25 at halftime, and
after trading baskets with the Warriors, the Danes final-
ly caught and passed Hartwick with [3:22 remaining.
Albany led 41-40. but the effort expended in gaining the
lead could not be duplicated. Hartwick kept their poise,
utilized their substantial size advantage, and held on to
defeat the Danes 71-63 at University Gym.

"‘1 thinkithe comeback took something out of us,”
said Albany coach Dick Sauers. “We started out cold —
we were a little down, but i didn’t think we’d be that
flat. Then our shot selection got pretty good — until the
last three or. four minutes. But (Jerry) Fulmer was
unstoppable, and their two big guys were just too big.”

The Dane’s record dropped to 15-4. and following
Tuesday night's shocking 63-62 overtime loss to Oneon-
ta, Albany’s SUNYAC mark stands at 6-2. The two set-
backs, arid especially the conference loss. switches the

precarious waiting game. Potsdam remains undefeated
in the conference, Albany has two losses, and Plattv
sburgh three. Two of those teams will represent the
Eastern Division of the SUNYAC in the conference
playoffs, and the Danes travel to Plattsbtrrgh for their

final game of the s ‘asolt.

Vandalism Issue Exposed

by Laura Fioretillrio

A SUNYA Physical Plant techni-
cian was fired Thursday for making
pirblic information relating to cani-
pits vandalism before reporting it to
hi. superiors.

'l‘homrts Dourielly: who worked
20 hours a week compiling data on
varidalisrii at SUNYA. was dismiss-
ed l’r'iday by Physical Plant l)ll't.'t_'r
tor Dennis Stevens.

Doririclly claims he was diseliarg<
ed because he was “disruptive to
the plant department."

()ne of the incidents involved was
the recent release of statistical data
concerning vandalism at SUNYA to

 

the Albany 'I'r‘ntt'x-Union.

The article stated that university
expenses incurred in connection
with student vaiidalistii could ex-
ccctl $500,000 annually. A recent
report. it. noted. estimates that
damages are only in the vicinity of
sxrirxio. ’

in addition. the article stated that
3.40.000 had been spent in the last
three years to replace fire cx-
titigtrishcts and exit lights. l)orirrc||_v
claims this ligitic won‘t c\ctt begin
to cover the damage.

According to Donnelly. another
reason for his dismissal ittvrilvcd his
report to the State linvironriierital

Stevens argtred that Donriclly had

without reporting to the Physical

Plant first.

Donnelly admits that he has
discussed his findings with students.

sists that he has always reported the
statistical information to his

Donnelly claims that Stevens nus

tiori from being focused on his
“inability to deal" with the pro-
blern.
