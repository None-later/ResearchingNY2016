WASHINGTON (AP) The I’Bll's
undercover political corruption in-
vestigation not only is posing im-
portant ctltical questions for
members of Congress. it's also pro-
viding a wealth of material for
Capitol Hill banter.

When I’lorida Republican ch‘.
Richard Kelly wertt on television to
present his version. he had what
l'lousc Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill
Jr. called a “tremendous listening
audience. At least of House
members."

Kelly ptrblicly acknowledged lak-
irrg $25,000 in an alleged bribery
scheme it] wlriclt Fill agents posed
as wealthy Arab shclks and
businessmen. llut he denied doing
anything illegal. saying he was
merely iii the process of conducting
an investigation of his own.

The ncxt day. Kelly came otrto
the House floor and took a scat

No date has been set for the

said if the court proceedings did not
prove satisfactory. he will pursue
litigation in an outside agency.

Funding Cuts

continued front page three

that O'Leary “is going to battle like
hell for us."

Associate Professor Leona
Rhcnish agrees that “some real
tough decisions are going to have to
be made" if faculty cuts become a
reality. “We know some of the
sports are going to have to go," she
said.

According to Rhenish. SUNY.
athletic programs will suffer more
budgets cuts than other university
deparlmcrrts because people "don't
recognize the educational value" in
sports.

Rhenish said that it is important
to "know and recognize the bettcfit
of activity as part of their everyday
life."

Athletic budget cuts may also
prevent SUNYA from complying
\\ith Federal Law, Title IX. accor—
ding to Schatsky. Title IX states
that institutions must grant equal
opportunities to both men and
uorrrcn. including itt\o|\'cmcnt in
athletic programs. according to
Scltatsky.

Schatsky said that some interest

 

has been indicated in favor of ad-
ding a Junior Varsity tennis team,
women's bowling, and women’s
field hockey to SUNYA’S athletic
program.

However, while SA is “moving in

_the direction of compliance" with

Title IX. state funding is necessary
to provide SUNYA with additional
coaches. he said.

Schatsky added that both New
York State and SUNYA have an
obligation to provide equal athletic
opportunities to both men and
women.

Ford expressed uncertainty as to
which sports would be affected by
possible budget cuts. However. he
did slate that “if history repeats
itself," those faculty members with
lcnurc would probably be affected.

As an immediate soltrtiorr. the
Plant Department intends to set the
temperature higher and increase the

"By 'l'ttcs‘rlay. there should be a
noticeable difference." Allen said.
“We won't let this problem slidc."

“If Donnelly has something to
say about things done in the Plant
Department, they should be looked
into publicly," said Levy. “If
Stevens fired him and doesn't
answer anything. Donnelly’s raising
it lends credibility to what he's
(Donnelly) saying."

Donnelly To Contlnuc Disclosures

Donnelly. who also works as a
photographer for SUNYA's Com-
rntrnity Relations Office. plans to
continue his disclosure of campus
problems.

“I started on this campaign and I
plan to continue cvcn thotrgh I
won't be paid anymore. Things
need to be told to the taxpayer and
tire students. I hope to bring them
out.”

In cotntncrtting on his position.
Donnelly rcflcctcd upon his values.

“My purpose is to bring informa-
tion to the students, faculty, and
taxpayers." he said. “He (Stevens)
warrch tire to prolch his position.
cover his ass. and look tltc other
way.”
