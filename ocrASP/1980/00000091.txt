If you're one ofthose people wlto
always put things off ttlttil tomor-
row, we've got just the cittb for
you.

The I’rocrasittators Club of
America. wiriclt was formed in
Philadelphia 24» years ago. is finally
getting.arount| lo a membership

‘drive. The eittb boasts a member-

ship of 600,000 persons worldwide
— although it admits that only 3500
of these have actually gotten
around to sending itr their applica—
nous.

The president atul founder of the
I’roeraslinators ('Iub is advertising
agency president I,es Waas. Watts
says he has Ircaded the group since
its inception iti [056. mainly

because — lll his words — “We

Atnurtg the club‘s traditions are
to celebrate New Year's in June (to
wait and see if it's worth
celebrating): and to Christmas shop
in January (to avoid the crowds).

A $10 initiation fee to the club
eventually brings you a Procrastina-
tion License. a copy of their bttllctirt
called “Last Month's Newsletter,"
a membership card. old Christmas
Seals and assorted odds and ends.

But Seriously...

An all-out nuclear war between
the United States and the Smiet
Union initially would kill about 250
million people — or slightly more
titan hall of the combined popula-
tious of both countries.

What‘s more, tens of millions of

additional casualties would occur
during the ensuing years, caused by
radiation from the original attack.
and starvation and disease follow
ing the collapse of the two nation's
social structures.
The study says that while ttrr all-out
war would probably kill more
Americans than Soviets because
tnore US. citizens live itt big cities,
the Soviet ecotrorny would suffer
rrrorc tong-term damage because it
is smaller and less efficient.

Life may not be so short after all.

The Journal of American In-
surance reports that one of the
fastest grewing segments of' the
population is the group of people
over 100 years old.

The Journal says that between
I974 and I978, the number of
centenarians jumped 43 percent in
the U.S.. to a record “.922. .

The Journal estimates that about
54'out of every 10,000 Americans
—— or about one iit every 200 —- will
live to reach the century mark with
women having a better chance than
area of reaching that goal. Seven
out of to people over 100 today are
women. .
