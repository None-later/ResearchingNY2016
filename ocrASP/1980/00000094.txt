Lls,
ll what your triendship meant to me
could be put In monetary value, $1
billion wouldn't be worth halt (so
don't worry about the $16 you owe
me). You've really turned out to be
some roommate. Don't worry about
the 'cuz everything has a way oi
working out and you deserve only
the be s (not the iloor, you ierk). i
don’t know how i can ever thank
you. You're a doll and you should be
at Brockport with the coach so they
don't have to "recruit" you
anymore. Happy Valentine’s Day
