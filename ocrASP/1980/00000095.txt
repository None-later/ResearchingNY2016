Albany State's women's brisket-

 ball team dropped their season
" ‘ record to 4-10 last week with two
~ .' disappointing losses.

On Thursday, the-Danes ven-
tured to Binghamton and tnet

defeat. 49-46. On Saturday they

were. stopped sltort by the College

fSt. Rose, 5654.

“The Bingltamton match was a
lose game to the end." said Albany
omen’s basketball coach Atny
iddcr. Both teams began play by
rading baskets. The llinghamton
‘olonial strategy revolved atound
enter Sunny Nehring, who scored
1 points in the first half, and the
folonials consistantly fed the hall
) her. "She was taller than any of
to other girls ottt on the court."

ifi'ecniled Kidder. The Danes
6" todii'ied their defense and attemp-

d to shift off the llingltamton
luad. who displayed poor outside
tooling throughout tlte entire
attic. Kidder called for a l~3~l
ovcrage working around Ncht‘ing.

 {The half ended with Albany down
' ‘by just one. 20-l9.

The second half consisted of
more close play. but Albany missed

_ some essential baskets. With less

than a minute remaining, the Col-
onials-went ahead by one. After a
series of turnovers, the Danes foul-
ed with five seconds left and never
recovered the points to fill the
deficit. The clock stopped and the
Danes swallowed the
“ltcartbrcaket‘.”

“We lack the experience to con-
trol a lead.“ commented Kidder.
“We have to go ottt and take a
cotntnattdittg lead." '

by Dancs' Kiln lloerncr. with l4

talk from a riled up Kidder.

With approximately ll minutes
remaining in the game, the Albany
team sparked. and finally began
playing aggressive basketball. St.
Rose scored only six more points in-

persistently stole balls frotn the op-
position.

Albany was down by just eight
points when CSR called a timeout

the past It) years. dropped a little
bombshell during a Sunday practice
session. He said he wrote a letter
three days ago. in which he claimed
that Tai and Randy's strongest
rivals — lrina Roduina and
Aleksandr Zaitscv of the Soviet
Union — were guilty ofat least four
technical violations during their last
skating competition. '

ting line-up back into the game.

Kidder enacted a triangle-and-
two combination defense and her
.girls slowly caught up. They were
down by five, 56'5l. )vhen Boomer
sunk a foul shot, and added another
notch to the Danes' score. The
mark stood at 56-52 when she miss-
cd her second fottl shot. The ball
bounced from the left side of the
basket rim into the hands of
LaLonde. Her shot was good. and”
now Albany was within two points.

with 25 seconds to go. Since no
timeouts were left for Albany. they
fouled St. Rose with ﬁve seconds '

shooter missed. Albany recovered
the rebound. but. again, ran out of
time, and lost by two points. . I

points in their expected tight duel
with Babilonia and Gardner. The
