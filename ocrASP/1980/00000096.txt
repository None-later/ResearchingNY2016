' Cortland Drops Swimmers, 65-417

The Albany State mcn's swimming team was defeated 65-47 by a powerful
Cortlund'squntl on Saturday at University l'ool. (Photo: Karl Cltnn)

by Bob Bellaflorc

“They're probably tltc best team
in the conference."

That's what Albany State men's
swimming coach Ron White said
about the Cortland State men's
swim team that set three University
Pool records, as they came iii and
defeated the Danes. 65-47 in a dual-
mcct Saturday afternoon. Albany's
record is now 8-3, wltilc Cortland‘s
is improved to 8-].

Ace swimmer Titn Walrath was‘
Cortland‘s top performer, as he ct-
cltcd his name into the record books
on three occasions. by swimming n
leg of tlic winning §00 yard frccstylc
relay team (pool rccord of 7:31.l
ininutcs). and Ittking both tltc l00
yard backstroke (55.97 scconds),
and the 400 yard individual medley
in 4:210 minutes (both record
time).

l-‘runk llctcr, not to he otttdottc.
was top swimmer for thc Danes as
ltc took thc ltX) yard butterfly in
55.03 \cconds (missing the school
rccord by 0.4 seconds), and sci it
new pool iind school record in win-
ning the Hit) yard brcttstrokc with it
tintc of [:0435 minutes. “it’s it

pretty impressive double at this time
of the year." commented White on
Heter's performance.

The other bright spot, according
to White, was the 400 yard mcdlcy
rélny team of Steve Bonnwitz, Joc
Shore) Hctcr, and Kevin Altcrh,
which defeated a stacked Cortland
quartet. and also sct a pool and
school record, clocking in at‘
3:45.89 minutes. White figures that
this Albany relay team could
possibly qualify for thc' Division lll
nationals. in all, five pool records
and two Albany State records were
set.

Other winners for tltc Danes were
Duvc Zybala (100 yard l'rccstylc --
52.02 seconds) and Bill Dcrkusch in
the tltrcc-mctcr diving cvcnt (2i 1.65
total points). Dcrknsch also placed
second in the onc-ni‘ctcr diving,
whilc Zybnla notched tltc tttintbcr
two spot iii the 50 yard frccstylc
(23.12 seconds).

The 500 yard freestyle row Alicrn
cotnc in sccond to Murkwurdt of
Cortland. with a time of 5:l0.32
minutes. The Dragons took the top
two spots in the 200 yard frccstylc.
Kcrry Donovan, who Whitc refers

'to as a key to team depth on the

Danes. was third;

“They are .very deep," said
White of Cortland. “That’s why we
had trouble with them." Pointing
out the fact that. in swimming, it is
easy to discern which team is
superior, White said he just wanted
to keep the Dane swimmers in their
specialiy events, and tried to create
the best matcliups. “You can see (in '
swimming) when a team is stronger
titan you." noted Whitcf “i felt
that Cortland was the stronger
tcam."

Despite the loss of co-captuin
Tom Robertsuo illness, Whiteywas
as confident as possible of his
squad. “i felt we could still give
them a rncct,” said While. "it was
flu: best meet we've ever had against
tlicm," he continued.

.Albtmy travels to Binghauiton
Saturday for a quadrangular meet
with Stony Brook, Buffalo, and
liingliumtou. White calls this the
SUNY University Center Cham-
pionships and. with a full week of
preparation for the meet, says
Whitc, “we hope to win it."

Indoor Track Squad Evens Record In Vermont

by Harold Diamond

The Albany Stiitc men's indoor
truck Icnnt cvcncd their record at
Ihrcc wins and llll‘CC losses last
Saturday in Burlington, Vermont.
Thc Ironic Icatm, thc University of
Vermont, took first with 96 points.
Albany plttccd second with 44

Albany's pcrt'ornttmcc was. fine in
light of the quality of the Division l

The two run the first milc togctlicr

was on important test for him,
because hc was unsure if he could
handle it Iongcr distancc and still
maintain a fast pace.

“That was the first timc I ever
ran the two mile in competi-
lion,".lnmcs said. “What really
hclpcd me was Mikc Sayers' mature

doing out there." Sayers lcd James
to a 4:42 mile and James finished
the last mile in 4:46. That was good
enough for u second place finish in
thc two milc at 9:267.

The best pcrl'orntttncc was
dcmonstrtttcd by sophomore Brttcc

“l guess it’s the enthusiasm l
have since l’m a freshman," said
Harvard, “l'm just so psyched be-

'l‘hc olhcr surprisc has been the
performance of Benton. He placed
for Albany in built tltc 440 and 50

improve. “i waited back too long,"
ufl'irincd Dcttton. “My sccond

Dcnton mndc it bclicvct' out of

“This is not my cvcnt, bttt, l was

much room for improvcmcftt. “l’m
