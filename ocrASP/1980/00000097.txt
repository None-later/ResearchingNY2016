“1 think it. is fairly clear that the
burden is going to be on the back of
SUNY to come up with it plan to

Johnson.

Wliitrtoti explained to legislators
that Carey's plan for funding
SUNY does not take into account

Wharton also critici/cd the es-
ecutive proposal for requiring that
the fiscal cutbacks be completed
“in a little frame that makes tliciri
irripossiblc for us in implement
without serious and far-reaching
dislocations."

The iinrricdincyof the proposal

you can't spetid a lot ofit iii careful

Whether proposed cutbacks
would affect SUNY campuses as
severely as Wharton stiggests rc-
tnains a matter for debate. O’Leary
believes that Wharton‘s carriptts
shutdown warnings are probably
little more tlrnti threats. l'le buc's

Johnson. on the other linrrd,
