Carcy has been going back on a
commitment to higher education
that the state has made." ,
According to Cronin, Carey has
claimed that SUNY budget cuts are
a part of a program designed to
“cut down on big government."
This argument cannot stand. he
said. as state spending was increas-
cd by $600 million iii the last year.
“Even if Carey didn‘t cut one
cent. we'd be cttt by 13 percent
bccttusc ol'thc inflation rate." said
Cronin. “Thcrc is money going to

v slatc agcncics. but it's not going to
