qy Douglas I_(ohn ' ' -
V Governor Carey’s proposal .tO
. make cutbacks in the SUNY system
has.brought to ligln heated debate

'regarding higher education in New

' York State. A controversial. paper
.prcpnr'ed by Joseph A. Kcrshaw.
_________...—__—..—

g. treat F€ATUR€

,
tinder ltte auspices of the Sloatt
Cornruission. a pattel of distinguish-
ed educators ttrtd citizens strrdying
the relationship between higher
education arid government has rais-
ed serious questions concerning the
SUNY system.

Kershaw states in ltis 42—pagc
paper‘nthat “SUNY's four universi-
ty centers exemplify tr major pro-
blem. It seems clear the state is not
going to be able to create l'our first
rate universities. It also seems clear
that il'it continues to try. all four of
tbcru will gradually slide irtto
mediocrity."

Kcr'shaw focuses on the cornpcti—
tion between private and prthlic in-
stittttions for statc funding. a com-
petition that is apparently being
won by the private sector. “’I‘hc
private sector antl its champions in
the legislature have succeeded ill
providing handsomely front the
slate treasury." l's'crshaw states itr
his paper.

According to a New I'nrk Times
article published on February 5. ortc
rcsrrlt of the state's conrrnitrucrtt
towards widespread funding of
whale institutions cotrld be the

 

Albany'Student Press.

_‘ “Commission Downgrades 

closing dowrt of some public institu-
tions. New York State may have to
forfeit its goal to establish four
Otttstanding university centers as a
r'éisult of this problem. The article
continues. "The state has trot raised
all four cetlters to an equal level of
excellence. and the little may be at
hand to consider whether the objec-
tive is feasible in light of the dire
predictions for the next twenty
years." I

Kcrshttw rccortttncttds that Iltc
stale concentrate its resources on
the “ccntcr‘s closest to achieving
distinction, Stony Brook arid Iluf-
fttlo, and weigh closing. or at least
downgrading the other two, Albany
and liinghnrntonfl'

'l'hcsc rcconuucndations ltavc
drawn strong reaction from of-
ficials at both Albany and
lliughamton.

SUNYA l’rcsidcttt Vincent
()'I.cary csprcsscd his indignation
over the report. critici/ing it for

’failing to trtrdcrtakc an ill-depth

analysis of the SUNY system and
called the data used by Kct‘sltttw
“outmoded.”

()‘lcat'y pointed otrl that KL‘I'-
shaw strbrrtittcd a sitnilar report to
thc Wesscl Commission in 1971
The report‘s rccotutncntlations,
however. were not incorporated irI<
to the commission‘s final report.
l‘r'csidcut ()‘lcar‘y believes that the

facts presented in Kershaw's
monograph make even less sense
now.

According to O'Lcary. Albany
and Binghamton arc the two most
popular campuses in the SUNY
system, with the highest cnrollrucrtt.
Buffalo and Stony ‘Brook were in
fact having trouble meeting enroll-
meitt goals. claims ()‘Lcary.

‘3. u

()‘l cary poitttcd out that ill the

‘ l‘)7[)s it became clear that it would

bc impossible for arty uniscrsity to
be equally strong in all areas. thus
resulting ill a large trrrrrrbcr of
urIi\cIsitics, including Albany. to
develop ccrtairr slt’ctlgtlls.

“Albany has taken advantage of
the trniqtrc crrvironrncrtt ill the state
capital.“ said ()‘l,cruy, He believes
that the truiwrsity has particularly
strengthened its College of Social
and llelraxior‘al Sciences arid has
btrilt cxtrcnrcly solid programs in

the areas of Criminal Justice.
Education, Social Welfare. and the

Graduate School of PubliC'Affairs. ~

As a result. Albany has a unique
profile among SUNY schools.
O'Leary believes;

"Each university center in New
York carries ortt specific missions
that are particularly related to the
regions that they ﬁnd themselves.
For example. Albany finds itself in
a region with a medical school. a
law school. and a fine engineering
school in RPI. Together with
Albarry these schools forrtr a capital
district higher education commtrui-
ly that can rucct an enormous varic-
ly of needs." said (I'Lcary.

()‘l.cary also believes Kcrshaw's
emphasis orl cutting back at the
urtivcrsity cctttcr level is misplaced.
He pointed to the fact that the e,\-
pcctcd decline ill college
enrollments will show up tnost
heavily at llrc undergraduate lcvcl.

‘I'o rectify this problem. New
York State nccds “quality universi-
ty centers. as represented by Albany
and lliuglrnmton. as \\cl| as Stony
Brook and Buffalo." to maintain a
stable enrollment level. said
()‘l.cary.

"Research arid rcscarchers are
one of the keys to the futtrrc
economic development of New
York State. Rather than cutting
back at the places where this

research is being done. support for
the centers should be increased."lhe
added; ;

O'Izeary;does'not believe the
report will be accepted and explain-
ed he will take further action by
presenting it to SUNY Chancellor
Clifton Wharton and the Sloan
Commission.

SUNY Binghamton University
Relations Director Roberta Schecr
questioned the report‘s validity.
citing the fact that it was based on
rcsearclr'done two to three years
ago. Schcer points out that Kershaw
cites tuition estimates from two
years ago. ' ' I

.Hls report. added Schcer. does
not take into account the efforts
made by the rrnivcrsity to correctl-
tralc its resources and become more
sciccliw in program offerings.

SUNY Vice Chancellor of
University Affairs and Develop-
ment Robert l’crrin stated. “The
report should be taken ill context as
a research paper done by one irr—
divitlual." When asked about the
reported difference in distinction
among the university ccrrtcrs. Per-
r'iu replied, “We at SUNY feel we
ha\c four first ratc universities.”
I’crrin does not see any cotupclition
between private arid public institu-
tions for state funding. citing the
states “long history" of supporting
both.
