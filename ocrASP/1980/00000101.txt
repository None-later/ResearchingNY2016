'Cause: Drugs

A New York congress member is
suggesting that tiiose excited Ira-
nian mobs who have been
demonstrating outside the U.S Erit-
bassy in Tehran just may be stoned
on hashile

This allegation is coming from
representative Lester Wolff. the
chair of the House Select Commit—
toe on Narcotics.

Wolff contends that — itt his
words — "Iran has a large traffic in

'hashisb. Quite obviously." he says.
r “the fcrvcr of tire demonstrations

outside tltc embassy indicates
stimulation of some sort."

It was pointed ottt to tire congress
member that the smoking of hash.
rather titan stimulating users. is
more apt to mellow llretn out —-
makittg them rtrorc passive.

llis reply: “It mcllows pcoplc ottt
to tltc point that they cart be led
very easily.”

Next President?

At least on presidential candidate
who‘s not getting a lot of media at—
tcnlion is Garrett Trapncll —— other-
wise known to officials at the
Marion Illinois U.S Penitentiary as
munbcr 72021-158.

Trapncll is a bona fidc candidate
for the prcs'idcnt of the United
Slalcs. He‘s also serving a life
scntcncc for air piracy. and tltc
Marion inntatc says tltc first thiitg
hc'll do if clcclcd is pardon himself.

'I'rapncll admits that as a con
viclcd l'clon. he can‘t volc III tltc

‘Trapuell has filcd'a suit irr U.S.

that Marion officials are breaking
