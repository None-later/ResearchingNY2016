Costello's back in ac-

Stage stuck and comfortably numb the boys in the
band see sunshine amid the dark vacuum of the
arena. But the fans only see the surrogate band, the
imposter hiding behind Cold eyes and sonic distor-

know the pain of standing naked in front of twenty
thousand screaming maniacs laughing because they.
like the sound twenty thousand bloody laughing
maniacs make in the arena. They want loudness and
dazzle and lights, lights, put on the lights, start the
show, turn up the volume, release the balloons, put
up the wall. They don't want to hear about being
stabbed in the back by the dogs, or robbed of
freedom of thought by vengeful teachers, and
freedom of love by desperate mothers. They don't
want to hear the eclipse of insanity. They don’t want
to be there at the machine. Maybe they too just want
to feel comfortably numb.

Floyd. Die or kill, They'd do anything for a nod to
