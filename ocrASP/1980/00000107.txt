“I can't believe it. .I Just can't believe It." she
boomed. "That God damn fucking car broke
down again." ’ . '

There's no mistaking that deep. gravelly
voice bellowing in the foyer, Meredith is
home. . . , V

Meredith Lippman. l vledly remember
those two years we lived together. Like the
weekly monopoly games We played with our
tip money to divvy up the week's bills. And do
you know those times Just when you think
nothing more can go wrong and it does? Well.
Meredith and I used to laugh. And We laughed
a lot. But It took us a lbng time to get this way
together. When she first moved into the Chat-
terton Parkway apartment things weren't so
peaceful. .

“Can you believe it?" she asks. She directs
the question to me. but really she ls speaking
to no one In particular.

Around Meredith. a painter. things were
nevei stale. She has a dominating personality.
and a delightfully deep. rich. resonant voice.
But her moods tended to set the atmospheric
pressure of the apartment. Whether it would
be volatile anger. hysteria, or hilarity could
never be forecast.

"What does that car want from me? I Just
put $167.00 iir it last Week."

Meredith throws her keys with a crash on
the coffee table. I put down “Sanity. Madness
and the Family" and wait. Her large leather
shoulder bag drops thud on the floor and
Meredith plops into the White velvet stuffed
chair facing. me on the couch.

“What does that car Ihlnk l'm made of?"
"What happened?" I asked feebly.. It was
often dangerous to interrupt one of Meredith's
rampages.

She grabbed my cigarettes. “Can I?"
"Sure." I said. i was out of matches. She
stomped into the kitchen and returned pulling
on her cigarette.

“I came out of Appleby's at 1:00 this morn-
ing. and the fucking car wouldn't start. You
know What it was like out tonight."

No.

"Pouring sheets and cold as hell. Roger and
Rosalie had already left so I couldn't even go
in to call." Roger and Rosalie owned Ap-
pleby's Restaurant where Meredith waltresserl.
“l had to walk a fucking mile in the God damn
rain to a gas station."

"Which one?" l asked.

“Who cares. After an hour. a whole fucking
hour. the guy finally decided he could come
and look at the fucking car." Usually Mereditii
affectionately called her 1975 brown Honda
CVCC "Baby". It was cute. she thought. with

     

12 inch wheels. “50 we got In his tow truck
and went to look at it. I already told him it
wouldn't start. but he tried It anyway. You
know what he said? ‘It Won't start‘. The God
damn prick. I told him that. What did he think
I was. stupid?" ' '

Personally. I felt sorry for the guy. Not only
did Meredith reach critical mass without much
provocation, but she was midstream in a les-
bian Ishate-men-stage. Whenever the lesbian
emerged from her bisexuality all men were

‘ pricks. A . '

"He poked around in the car for another
hour and Just grunted. ‘alternator wires. Wet.
Can't dry 'em In, the rain.’ 50 he hitched the
car up and towed It into the Station. At least it
Wasn't anything more serious." A slight
reprieve from the hysteria. Even a smile. wry
as it was. “He dried out the Wires and It started
up Instantly. l was ecstatic. But then the bill.
Do you know what It was? Do you know how
much he charged me?"

l shook my head no.

“$30.00. Thirty Goddamn-dollars. Just to
dry my fucking wires. 1 gave him hell. Let me
tell you."

l'm sure you did. I thought.

“Those lousy $30.00 were my tips front
tonight. Piglet. l was out of cigarettes. And I
couldn't even buy any because he took every
God damn cent I had." She eyed my
Winstons.

"Go ahead." I said. She lit another. "Have
as main as you like. I've got a carton in the
bedroom." I lit one‘too.

"Thanks." she said. She took along drag. “I
can‘t believe It. It's highway robbery. That's
what It Is. All mechanics are fucking pricks.
What the hell did those pricks stick me with
$167.00 for? They gave me a new alternator
that I didn't even need. I'll sue those bastards.
l can't afford this. Piglet. I can't afford to shell
out money every two mhiutes on that God
damn fucking car. I should sell it."

I know she never will. Meredith's car is her

.freedom. Her escapemobile. She loves to

drive and feels trapped without it.

"Maybe you should." I said.

“I can't. I need the fucking wreck to get to
work."

“Meredith. we can both use my car. You
drive George when you go to work. Later. I'll
take a bus to classes and then drive George
home'so I can get to work on time. When
you're finished take the bus home and walk to
Turco's and pick up the car. Drive it up to Ap-
pleby's. l can walk home from Turco's or get a
ride from Sandy.“ .

"Maybe." She drew hard on the cigarette.

 
  
  

 

Margaret A. Brewster
“No.” sh'e‘said through exhallng smoke. "That
Won't work, Besides, where am I going to find
.the time to look?“ Meredith had been working
seventy-five hours a week for the last two
months. Days up on Purchase campus in an
office. a Job she despised. and waltressing
nights: a Job she also despised. But it paid the
rentf

“I know It won't be easy. but we can do it.
I'll helpyou look." I said.

“No. It won't work With our schedules. I
wouldn't be able to see Maureen because you
need the cér to get to work." Maureen was
Meredith's therapist.

Sorrr~rrrry. I thought. I must have made a
face.

“Thanks anyway." she said quickly. “lt's
sweet Piglet. but It Won't work. What am I say-
ing. see Maureen. I can‘t afford to see her
now. I can‘t even buy those paints I wanted."
Even though Meredith had no space to paint
her six foot by eight foot canvases in our two
bedroom apartment. she aIWays bought
paints.

Puffing on a fresh cigarette. Meredith left
the room. I heard a door slam. I picked up my

“Lily/$06Hlfli'l‘isheéfiicireamedl 3 "OH?" FUCK ."
Her voice was strained in an octave not her
own.'and‘ a bit desperate. l got to the door of-

th’e living room as she tromped out with her '

coleus and aralia plants held at arms length. "I
can't stand It. APHIDS. My plants have
aphids." She Went straight to the kitchen.
“Where are the God damn garbage bags?"

I couldn't believe she was going to throw out
her favorite plants. but this time I Was going to
keep my mouth shut. »

“Where are they?" v
“Under the sink." I said as I arrived in the
kitchen.

“I' still can't find them."

I reached under the sink and pulled them
from behind ihe,Dove. Cornet. 5.0.5 pads
and empty grocery bags. “Here."'l handed her
one.

“I can't believe it. I Just hope none of my
other plants have them. I can't afford to
replace them all." The coleus and aralla Were'
in the garbage bag now. Meredith sat down at
the kitchen table. “I Just can't stand it. IJust
can't stand it." Tears started barrellng down
her cheeks.

l was waiting. The tears had to come.

"Why?" she cried as l held her.
, The tears only dribbling now. we Went to
her bedroom and checked her other plants.
They all escaped the aphids. She hunted
through the plants pinching off dead leaves.
She pruned off scraggly stalds and set them in
her clipping jar. Picking up the mister she went
to the bathroom. I heard the w*..er turn on
then off. Back In her room she fondled the
leaves. dusting them and, dousirrg them with
mist.

“Oh. my babies." she cooed. "Mommy's
here to'take care of you."

I began to chuckle as I always did when she
talked to her plants. This time Meredith laugh-
ed too. '

“Thanks.” she said without looking up.
"How was your night?"

"Quiet." I replied. - .
