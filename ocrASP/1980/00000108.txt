your precious American blood seeping into'
tlte foreign mud. yottr ﬁnal home. Tlte agony

is even greater now. Your hands are grasping

wildly at the'uir. clutcltiug. groping. But they

find nothing. All of a sudden. in tire ever

dimming light. you see somebody standing

over you..At first. a slight tinge of hope is

mixed into your horrible burning

niglttmare‘...but tlten you see he wears the

colors of the other team. He thougltt yott

were trying to reach for your weapon, to spill

ltis blood. as the game is played. He does ttot

know. He does not even dream of your tor-
turous pain. Your weapon is tltc farthest

thing from your mind. All you cart tlrittk of is
not dying.

He looks down at you. As he looks irtto
your face he feels sorrow. He would like to
help you. But he can't risk it. So lte thinks of
a solution. and sends another half ounce
piece into your brain, causing a flow of your
fine American blood stronger tltan a ntighty
river’s current.

You payed an expensive price to call that
blood American. attd you hardly even got to

use it.

Protest Within System

To the Editor:

The short-sightedness and hypocrisy of to-
day’s college students show quite clearly
when examining the draft issue: First.
students seem to believe that the draft is
something that began during the Viet-Nam
war and,-second. although young Americans
are the ﬁrst to protest and complain. they are
the least likely of all Americans to exercise
their right to vote.

Most of the rhetoric being brought forth itt
opposition to the draft rests on the premise
that a draft means war and war means

comment:

another Viet-Natu. One only has to look 'as
far as our class roottt walls to evidence sup-
port of this View: posters and signs blanket
them with slogans such as “Stop the draft -
No more Viet-Nants".

Contrary to popular belief. the anti-draft
movement did not cmci‘gc itt this country lit
the '(rl)’s—-—un|ess you are speaking of the
two's. Anti-druft rallies. protests. and riots
rocked major northern cities itt response to
conscription initiated during the Civil War.
Both World Wars were preceedcd by tremen-
dous anti-draft movements also. Directly
prior to World War ll pacifist feelings ran
particularly high: ltt the late 1930's. after
Hitler had turned Germany into a war
machine. a national poll showed 39 percent of
fall undergraduates said they would not par- -
ticipatc in any war and an additional 33 per-
cent would only figltt if the United States was
actually invaded. These examples are meant
to show tltut anti-draft feelings have always
been strottg lll this country no matter how
great a threat is facing our nation.

Most protestors against the draft (and
other government policies for that matter)
are. by attd large. hypocrites. Plain and sim-
ple. Non-voting Americans who are eligible
to vote may have the legal riglu to criticize
our government but i believe they lack the
moral rigltt to do so.

The youth of our nation find plenty of
titue to protest and complain but the majori-
ty of them can‘t find the time to try to imple-
ment change iii a constructive manner—by
votittg. They are simply feedback
mechanisms doing nothing to alter or add to
the initial irtput of government. it is time for
college age Americans to begin working
within the system—using their votes to make
their voices heard. That is what democracy is

all about.

So now l‘m somc sort of intellectual col-
Icgc guy and i should know enough to choose
whether ot not to go to Afghanistan with no
indecision. i read Tutu! every week and the
.vlSl’ on 'l‘ttcsdttys and Fridays. i know the
issues. Not clearly. Nobody knows tlrcttt
clcttt’ly. bttt I got a good idea of what they
inc. 1 know now what I would do.

But my blood boils at those who instantly
speak of (‘unadtt and my skirt curls itt the face
of those who want to ttukc lrun now. The
lack of tltonght and painstakingly weighing
the issues is attralittg itt a community of such
intelligent people. Don‘t search for your

Dear Grandpa. .
I write to you rtow. Because l'm scared.
l'm scared grandpa. Because l realized that I can never be a soldier. Like you

were. And be proud. Like you were. ‘Cause l haven’t the guts. Like you had. To

snuff out life. . \
Attd it frightens me grandpa. ‘Cause you believed. And most believed. That. it was<

  
  
 
 
 

all for our glorious homeland. Atrd her vital interests. This war. The big one.

And how proud you must have tell! And lightly so. How your heart must have
tittgled. and sang. Attd swollen. Attd strained. For America. The beautiful. And oh
she is beautiful. Your purpose. if only i could feel this too. grandpa. Things would
be so nutch simpler.

People shout traitor. Tltcy shout coward. i hear them. Attd the same in silent 

   

.—

whispers. When l‘m alone. Can‘t get rid of them. They soil my brain. And seed my
cells. No one cart escape them. We cart only kid ourselves.

_ But what of that ntore powerful force? A voice? That calls me away from all that.

It soothes nte. Attd it’s warm. Attd it tells tne.~ It does grandpa. Over and over and .
over. And again. That love must triumph. Attd that it will. That war is the most
visible symptom. Of the disorder mankind httd inflicted on herself. Since the begin-
‘ ning of time. it says that thou shalt ttot kill. At no time. In no context. For no pur-
pose. For no body. Over and over and over. And again. And it also tells me. That 3 .

there are always other ways. Reasonable. Just. Logical ones. We lose this notion.
And we have lost the ultintatc war.

But you've told me that war is ttot murder. Grandpa? That it's just war. And it's
different. This jolts the more. As if we're justifying. Putting killing itt a different
context. An 0K one. Like we're trying to blind our eyes. As we snuff out lives.

But it's getting clearer to me. Throughout history. It reads itt black and white.

 
   
 

grandpa. Attd red.
i would do anything. Everything. To serve America. And proudly. I love her. i
ant thankful. Auytltittg. And everything. But kill. This is too muclt. Too crucl. To

ask of anyone.

Because I was raised. By you. Your son. Your culture. To care about my brothers.
Not to run away from injustice. But to recognize it. And fight it. Attd destroy it.

And now 1 am castigated. Because 1 think. And I care. Attd my conscience is getting
denteaned. As if it is an ill one. Perhaps I took my teachings too seriously. Perhaps <
I've been lied to.

Perhaps when the time comes. We should make bullets out of solid oil. Then no
one would be sltot. l've this uncanny sense though. Past proﬁt-seeking. Beyond 3
obstinaey. lt questions deeply rooted sociocultural forces. At work. Societies fester- .
ing. And nurturing. A climate of violence. it has become engraincd in the world's
veryday fabric. Frotn cradle to grave.

They may arrest me. And grandpa this frightens me too. tltoreau was jailed. So
as Socrates. and galileo. And now they are dead. And martyrs. You can't smash an
idea. By putting it behind bars. And you shouldn't describe my protest. As my social
fun.

Perhaps my trouble is that l have thought too ntuclt. Felt too much. Dreamed.
Attd believed. Optimistic. About people. But is this my trouble? Or is this my vir-
tue?

l'm scared grandpa. Scared of my thoughts. And of yours. Attd America's. And
the world's. l'm sorry ifl hurt you. And Grandma. But please. i BESEECH YOU.
For the sake of mankind. Tltittk that you may be mistaken.
