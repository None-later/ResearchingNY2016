' Most of all, Kopp taught and '

utilized the Albany State system to

its fullest. ,. .

Kopp tried to downplay his role
in the team’s success. citing tlte old
adage that “coaches don’t win
games, they only lose them."

“At the beginning of the season.
I wasn’t sure how we were going to
do. Most people had no hope for

us.”'reflectc.d Kopp. “But the at-_
titude of the remaining eight was ‘

excellent. Small problems will hap-
pen on any teartt. My guys Worked
as hard as any other learn." he Coll-
tinued. . -

Kopp tried hard to push the
credit onto his players. "The eigltt
that stuck out the year are a real
good bunch of guys. Everybody
just worked real hard together. I
ttever had reason to get mad at
anybody for lack of effort."

Indeed. tltosc tltat stayed were
hard workers. hustlers. and
dedicated. Such detertttirtatiott
often resulted in foul‘ trouble for
Albatty. btrt as tlte record sltows. it
won ballgantes.

Albany did ltavc those players
that stood out tltottglt. itt tltc pct-
sorts of (iaincs attd (iatto. ’l'hc
.l.V.'s two pip varsity prospects
averaged 17.4 attd l5.4 poirtts per
garttc. respectively. “We looked to
hint in tottglt situations." said Kopp
of (iaincs. wlto had the team higlt
game (30 points against Union).
and did the bttlk of the ball ltattdl-
ing. When asked to compare the
two witlt regards .to valtte to the
team. Kopp replied. “You cottld
toss it tip."

How could a college basketball
learn witt without depth?

How could a college basketball
team will witltottt ltcight’!

How cottld a college basketball
teant‘. witlt all the problctits. atlvct-
sity. arid a new coach cvett dream‘
about a witttting pcrcctttagc of .800
over a 2lI-gante schedule?

However they did it. they won.
Most of their games were referred
to by players as “learn efforts."
The sutuc can be said for the whole
season.

"We won a couple tltat we pto-
bably should have lost." said Kopp
in retrospect. “Overall. we ltad a
pretty good year." l.ct's hear it for

As was the ease III the dual meet
with Union. Albany's maitt
weakness seemed to lie iii the field
evettts. The Danes never finished

With the completion of last
