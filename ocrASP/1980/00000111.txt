Men 9S SWim Team Set For S UN YA‘C ChampirmsShip.si‘i

by Jeff Schadol‘t' _

Tlte regular season is over atrd tlte
Alban' State men’s swim tearrr is
“shooting for the stars".’ so to
speak, as they prepare for the up-
corrrittg SUNYAC charrrpiortships
this Tlttrrsday. ,

'i‘he Danes finished the season
with a dual-meet record of It) witrs
and 4 losses, second best season
ever to tlteir 1977-78 carrrpaigrt ttt
13-2. With a winning percentage itt
dual meet corrtpetitiort of .714.
Albany swimming coach Ron Wltite
was “e-Jcrall. very pleased."

Now that the regular season has
been completed the SUNYAC
championships are now of the
essence. The Danes are sending
three relays to Potsdam with three
swimmers solely participating in in-
ttividual events.

The otte relay that gets preference
is Albany's rrtedley relay consisting
of Steve Bonawitz. Joe Shore.
Frank Heter, and Kevin Alrertr.
"Our medley has had top seed tirtre
all season. We_.'re just polishing it
off for the Nationals.” said Wltite.
The two remaining teams have
Altern, Heter. Dave Zybala, and
Tom Roberts swimming the 400 and
800 'yard freestyle relays. "Our
relays are good relays." added
White. Ahern felt "the 400 should
finish in the top three with the 800
hopefully getting a good effort
also."

Rounding out the Dane squad of
nine to Potsdam are switrrtrrcrs
Kerry Donovan arid Jim (‘olgan
and diver Bill Derkaseh. Matty of
the swimmers contpetittg irt the
relay events are also competing itt~
dividually as well. “Last year we
went to the SUNYA("s with nine
guys attd did the best we ever did
(4th out of l2). We have more
potential rrow. as l tlrirtk back at
preseason in September wltcrr i had
some doubts." said White.

An important part of a team‘s
preparation for the big SUNYAt‘
meet is to be able to “taper” as suc-
cessfully as possible w to go from
basic bulk training to that of preci»

siott discipline itt order to perfect
L‘VCt'y aspect of the event. “We had
three weeks to prepare bttt this past
week has been one beautiful taper
week. 'l‘lrerc's Ito dotrbt about it ——
they‘ll be ready. This team is tltc
h‘est tapered attd ntost rested learn
l vc ever scert irt the s'x' years I'm
coaching here." ttrentioncd White.

Getting down to the competition
on.paper. Cortland should \\‘ill it
all. The battle is for the nest three
spots with Potsdam getting the edge
on second dtte to their slight dcptlt
advantage and (ieucseo and Albany
battling for the next two spots. llut
if “we pttt all the pieces together we
cart hope for a big one rtt the end. it
would really blow our minds for a
second witlt third rttcritirtg an cv-
ccllettt showing atrd fourth place ~—
par~for-tIre-course." said While.

ltt the diving l)crkttsch represents
the Dunes and White feels that
"He‘s ready for the upcoming
SUNYAC clrartrpiortslrip competi-
tion. He has an opportunity to
place at least sixth on both boards
(one and tltrec nrcter)."

Contntenring on the cottclttded
regular season. White said. "We
had. with ottr schedule. a real
pressure season which tirade trs stay
on top of ottr game at all times.
We've had tough reams all through
otrr schedule which gave for rrrarty
close meets — most of them down
to the last relay. We've also ltad a
couple of heartbreakers along with
a few surprise \virrs - unexpected
back irt preseason. The guys are
very dedicated. I enjoy coaching a
winner tttrd this teattr has definitely
been a winner."
