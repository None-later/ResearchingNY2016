The Albany State men‘s
volleyball team upped their record
to 7-1 in an action-packed week.
with wins over New Paltz. RPI.

and their ﬁrst defeat. to Springﬁeld

tories were marred by injuries to
key starters.

“We're in better shape now than
we were a couple of weeks ago. but
we're not healthy." said Albany
volleyball 'coack Ted Earl. “But
others are getting experience now
because of the injuries and they're
responding well. Hopefully We’ll
have everybody ltcaltlty for our big
games in tire middle of March."

On Saturday Albany travelled [0

tional match. 13-15, 15-9. 15-13.

witt." said Earl. “They puntntcllcd
Rl'l‘ attd they were feeling pretty
good about themselves—we just
took the fire otrt of them. It was an
emotional win for us.”

then went on to beat Nyack two out '

Albany was also scheduled to

Earl somehow looks at the bright
