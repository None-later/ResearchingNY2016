There was an unlikely series of‘
events at the SUNYAC tournamentr
in Buffalo last weekend, resulting in
some anxious moments for the
Albany State basketball team. But
Sunday evening. the Danes received
the news they had been waiting for
-— Albany. for the second ‘year in a
row, was ill the NCAA playoffs.
The Danes will face St. Lawrence
tonight in the first round of the
Division lll East Regional in
Potsdam. while the SUNYAC
Champion Potsdam Bears (24-3).
will host Stony Brook (1&8) in tltc
second game.

“Any one of the four teams can
win it.” said Albany coach Dick
Sauers. “it’s really up for grabs.
Potsdam has a tremendous advan-
tage by playing on their home
court, but they have already lost
three home games this season.
Whoever can get it going will win it.
and I feel the winner of the East will
go a long way. We have as good it
chance as anybody."

l‘hat cltance was almost blowu in
Buffalo’s cozy Clark Hall last week.
where the top four squads truth the
conference‘s east and west divisions
met to determine the SUNYAC title
and the automatic bid to the
playoffs. After Potsdam got by
Buffalo State. {34-56. on Friday, the
Danes and Buffalo squared off in
what turned out to be» a slow-
motlon marathon. It took regula—

tion play and four overtitnes to

separate the two teams, and in tltc *

end, almost three hours after. it
began, the Bulls came away with a
65-57 victory. The next night, itt
their final impression on the NCAA
selection committee. Albany needed
a convincing decisiott over the 11-15
Buffalo State Bengals. ,The Danes
came through with a 98-61 trounc-

ing of the Bengals. and then watch-

ed as Potsdam's Ed Juchint hit two
free throws with 24 seconds left to
seal the Bear’s 50-45 triumph over
Buffalo.

Potsdam was in. So was St.
Lawrence, wirttrers of the indepen-
dent College Athletic Conference
(lCAC). Next cartrc the two at-lttrgc
bids. and based on their l 1-0 record
against Division III teams itt New
York State. Stony Brook was
selected. There was one spot to be
filled. and the two possibilities were
Albany (20—5) artd Buffalo (l7-lt)).

"We felt there were several teams
in the east of NCAA calibre.“ said
Dave Ocorr, chairman of the Divi-
sion lll Eastern Regional selection
cotnruittee over the phone on Mon-
day. “Tltcre was ferocious competi-
tion between Albany and Buffalo
— it went four overtirnes on the
court and in otrr committee. We
had good discussion, arid the voting
was very close. Albany's strong
points were their record. their two

against a darn good Buffalol team
(the Danes defeated Bttffalo 66-58
earlier in the season), and the
strength of the east division of the
SUNYAC compared to the west
divisiOn. When we gave the national
committee otrr recommendations,
we gave'thcm the four learns that
were eventually picked, and we also
asked them to consider the Buffalo
situation — we wanted tltcttt to at
least know that there were other
teams itt the east with good records.
'fhen tltc national committee voted
unanimously for Albany.”

“Albany got in bccttuse of the
strength of their schedule." said
Torn Murphy, basketball couch and
athletic director at Hamilton. and tr
tnetnber of the East Regional selec-
tiott committee. “And the last game
at Buffalo went four overtimes, so
it's obvious that it was a pretty
equal game. if Buffalo had beaten

have been ill. llul based on the
closeness of the game. turd their 1-1
record against each other. and look-
ittg at their schedules and corn—
pttrtttivc scores, Albarty gets it. Buf—
falo has beaten nobody with n witt-
ttirtg rccord — 'l‘hcy've only bcutcn
losers.”

So tltc loss to the Bulls did not
leave the Danes eliminated. but it
certaitrly left them frustrated. Buf—
falo used the small court to their ad-

defcnse. with 6-6 center Nate Bouic
applying enough intimidation to sti-
flc the Dane inside game — three.
Albany postmett managed just three
field goals among them. Btrt guards
Winston Royal and Rob Clttnc pro-
vided the Duties with early 12-6 and
[9-12 leads, and they secured on the
verge of forcing the Bulls ottt of
their zone. l-lpwcver.Albany shot 4t
percent during the gttme. allowing
Buffalo to stick with their defense.
despite repeated slowdowns by tltc
Danes. At the half, it was Albany
holding a 2l-2t) lead; after regula-
tion play. it was 36-36; then tied at
38 after one overtime. 4] after the
second. 45 after three‘cxtra periods.
before Buffalo exploded for 20

_ points in the fourth overtime.

“I assumed they would play a
zone." said Sauers after the game.
“They played its man-to-rtrrtn the
first time. Bttt we didn’t shoot very.
well, and their zone made
everything jammed up irt tltc mid-
dle. attd they were bigger than we
were. so we couldn‘t pass the ball
over them." '

“We got ittto it quick lead. so we
were content to hold the ball out."
said Royal. the Dane Cttplttitt.
“They play on that small court. and
they have good height. They just
didn't switch to a Irtntt~to~nran."

“The zone is otrr best defense."
Buffalo coach' Bill Hughcs said.
“You saw what they did the few
times we went man-to-mun -— they
killed us. i thought they did it good
job against our zone, but we hav - a
good zone, atttl it‘s tough to beat."

Despite their difficulties. Albany
still had fotrr golden opportunities
to win the game — four shots that
cottld have clinched a Dane victory
—- but each chance came up empty.
With 1:49 left itr regulation, Albany
took control. the score tied at 36.
The Danes held for the last shot,
