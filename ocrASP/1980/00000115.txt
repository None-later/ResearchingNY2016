Frustrated but uudauntcd.
Senator Kennedy tried to smoke the
President out of the White House.
Look at the record. the Senator im-
plut'cd. Inflation at fourteen per-
cent. the economy in ruins. foreign
affairs in a jumble. It was a struggle
but it scents that Kennedy's pleas
had a limited impact on the New
Hampshire voters.

I’ollslers were widely predicting a
2 to l margin of \ictory for the
President. especially damaging itt
Kennedy‘s backyard. But the final
results were tnttch closer than that:
Carter. forty-nine pcrccnl -- Ken-
nedy. thirty~eight percent. Certainly

Bush was fuzzy on the issues. As he
received more and more press atten-
tion. his stands became less and less
clear (sound like 3 I976 can-
didalc7). The second. more crucial
occurrence was the SNAFU'd
debate between Reagan and Bush in
Nashua. NH. Bush was labelled as
arrogant and selfish by the other
candidates frottt his owtt party.
Reagan came out smelling like a
rose. and looking like he belongs iii
the Ruse Garden. That event, more
than anything else, conﬁrmed for
the voters what Bush's opponents
ltavc been trying to portray all
along -- that Bush is a Yale
educated, preppy, northern conser-
vative who has little in cotntnon
with the majority of the voters.
Reagan looked sure and ccttaitt. the

lhtt once again. let's not count
chickens. This contest is fat ftotn

Republican into the I'oteftont. If
