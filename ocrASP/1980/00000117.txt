Dirty Alr Advantage

Humans are not tlte only ones to
suffer from addiction: crops such as
corn. cabbage and cotton are
becoming addicted to -— believe it
or rtot - filthy air.

That‘s the ﬁnding of Tennessee
Valley Autltority researcher. LC.
Noggle. who'says that air pollution

front coal burriirtg plants has taken_

the place of fertilizers irt providing
the sulphur nutrients by many
crops.

Sulphur, says the researcher. is
the essential brtildiiig block for pro-

‘3,..:;.,:

at

tcin and chlorophyll, the green
substance which allows a plant to
use energy front the sun.

If the polluted air is cleaned up,
the "addiclet " crops would have to
go “cold turkey" on their sulphur
habit, and according to Noggle.
that would cost rttore tltatt $300
million a year irt crop losses.

Noggle suggests that. “If e
clean tip tlte air, then the cost of
