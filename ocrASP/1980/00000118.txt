Peer Advisors

in the Editor:

As a firtn believer that students should
asstrtnc a greater responsibility for the opera—
tion of their college or university. l have
always advocated that students get more in»
tolved iii the procedures that affect them.
One of the university's major deficiencies is
the abhorrent condition of acadetnic advise-
ttrctrt for undergraduates. The adtninistratiott
doesn't care cttotrgh to itttptovc this vital
area. as the ttpeoming pre-registration will
show when chaos and confusion become the
norm ftrr tltc SUNYA uttdcrgrnduate.

it‘s titrie for the students to confront. and
master. this situation. No ortc else is going to
do it for us. The Political Science Depart-
rttetrt is sponsoring a unique program to deal
with the advisement problctn. “Peer ad-
visors“ will be tvailablc to the undergraduate
during pre-regtstratiOIt itt order to as ist
students who need academic advice. These
peer advisors will come from sortie of the
roost sensitive people on campus: students.
These stttdcttt advisors will be tltoroughly
trairted by CUE and will be loaded with in—
formation concerning: majors. rrrirrot's. dou—
hie majors. graduation reqttirctnents. etc.
These peer advisors will be available to talk
to students at arty time: on the podium. in the
Rat. etc.. arid will ltave office hours during
tltc day rttrd iii the evenings so that all irr-
tcr‘estcd sttrdetits will be able to obtain these
services.

This is a unique opportunity to establish a
permanent structure that deals directly artd
effectively with the advisement problem. This
program was set up with considerable sttrderrt
itrptrt rtrrd has the fttll support of the Political
