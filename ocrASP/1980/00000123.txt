“We looked over every area to

she said. blrl llre increase was ap-
proved by an ll.(r vote at Wednes-

Originally UAS Director [3.

around very ltigli figures like $50-60
for the standard plalt and a seven

We cart absorb with the $35 in-

Regarding the Kosher rtrenl plan
which serves over Slit) people. she
said. "it loses money eicl‘y year.
since Kosher food is so cxpettsi\c,

"This is penali/ing stirdcrrts for

” l‘he faculty and the administrative
directors of the board suggested all

they like to make a profit," said
Gold. “They didn‘t even think llre

to close.

Last Thursday. in an open discus-
sion with residents of Dutch Quad's
Schuyler Hall. SUNYA President
Vincctit O’Learyr noted the
“coincidence” thgtullioo positions
are being eliminated from SUNY
schools while Stony Brook Hospital
is being supplied with a staff of
1300.

“What they're doing, in effect. is
staffing the place with professors." _
said O'Leary. "

According to Haffner. arguments
such as the one presented by
O‘Leary are a “really silly way of”
looking at it." i

“The hospital was being planned
as early as l970." said Haffner. “it
was created as an important compo-
nent to the Stony ltrook Medical
School. But people think that since
the hospital is just opening. the cuts
.arc occurring becalrsc of it."

“It is unfortunate the hospital is
being blamed for the budget cuts,"
said llaffner.

According to llrrgli l‘nohlri. a

for SUNY to build a teaching
hospital at Stotry lirook sitrcc there
“aren't arty DIlHliL‘ hospitals

school to have its own teaching
hospital.

Tuttltlll refused to cornttterrt on

the hospital is. ill effect. being staff-

Aecording to Haffner. the Stony

ty of 540 beds. arid will mainly treat

Senate Passes Academic Proposals

by Debbie Kopf

Changes iii the University final
exam policy, and iii the definition
of “incomplete” grades were
among the major proposals passed
by the University Senate Monday
afternoon.

The new final exam policy states
that finals be given only dtlritrg the
little officially scheduled by the
Registrar. and that no finals be
givcti during the last five regularly
scheduled class days of the
scnicsler.

A final exam is now defined as
“any cxanriliatinlr of more than
one-half hour's duration that is
given in the terminal phase of a
course." An exam need not becom.
prelretisivc to be considered a filial.

'l'hereforc. no exam trrore than
one-half lrolrr long may be given
during the last week of class s. ln~
struclors wishing an exemption
frorn the policy rirttst submit a writ-
lett request for title to the dealt of
his or her school.

Tile new policy is expected to
strengthen the existing final exam
policy. passed by the Senate in the
past.

“Tire situation is currently very

rotrgli on faculty members who give
finals during finals week when no
one else does." said Undergraduate
Acadcrriic .Coutrcil (UAC) (.‘liair
llarold Cannon, “there is an in-
crcasing tendency among students
to clrt the last days of tltosc classes
to study for their earlier finals.
Many important topics covered in
llrose last few days are missed by
these students." he added.

“l'vc had all too many students
get caught with too trirrclr work irr
that last week. said Senator Robert
Gibson of the Center for
Undergraduate [Education ((TUli).
“and this has affected tlrertt
adversely."

“i had a lot of problems with the
bill and did not vote for it." said
Senator Neil (iclfand, a sophomore
front (‘olonial. “i don't think it's
fair to students to have all their
finals bunched up within) one week.
when they cotlld be spread out over
a longer tirrie period." he said.

Senior Class President Senator
DttVt.‘ Weintraltb spoke in support
of the bill. "I really don‘t llrirtk
four extra days of work will make it
rliuch harder. when you compare it
to getting a good education."

lit a major grade policy revision.
the Senate approved changes iii the
'length of llttt‘ a student may have
an “incomplete” (l) grade.

Under the new system. if a stu-
dctit does not corrrplcte course work
by one month before the end of the
semester in which the incomplete
was received. the student will
receive the penalty grade of “.l" (or
“ "' if the course was graded S-U).
Both “.l" and “K” are acadcrrric
penalty grades. to be computed irilo
the students grade poitit average as
art “E” with zero credit.

Grades of “J” and “ "' cart be
changed by the instructor.

“Good students are the titles who
will benefit frottl this bill." said
(.‘anrton. “lticompletes. should be
lakcti care of and not left on a
student's record indefinitely.

Both measures take effect begin-
trirtg Fall I980.

lrl other action. the Senate placed
an arnendnrerrt to the faculty by»
laivs on the upcoming faculty
meeting agenda. This amendment
may extend student representation
on the Senate another 4 years. The
facility currently rtrust vote to ex-
tend student representation ori the
Senate every 2 years.
