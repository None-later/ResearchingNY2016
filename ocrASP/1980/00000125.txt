. Students Gilli-Buses Unreliable;

Steven's Says. Running Smoothly

by Andrew Carroll

Off-campus and Alumni Quad
to complain

residents continue
about the University's bus service,

despite claims by Plant Director,

Dennis Stevens that the buses are
running smoothly.

Many students are particularly
concerned about bus scheduling.

In a memo released late in
January, Stevens and Student Af-
fairs Dean Neil Brown warned that
budgetary restrictions and the
threat of driver illness would
hamper the efficiency of the buses.
Adaptations of .the bus schedule
were promised in that memo. and
SUNYA President Vincent
O’l.eary granted the use of limited
overtime funding for the bus
system. -

But one month later. Stevens said

Budget
Teach-In

Increases
Awareness

by David A. Proujan

informing the University cont~
munity about Governor Huglt
Carey's proposed budget cttts in the
SUNY syslctn was the major topic
of a day-long “budget leach-in"
Tuesday.

Based in the Campus ("enter
Fireside Lounge. the SASU/UUP
sponsored teach-in outlitted short
and long term results of tlte cuts
SUNY-wide. Emphasis was placed
on measures to take to stop Carey's
actions.

Teach-in organivcrs reminded
people tltat Carey has itttposed
budget cuts itt SUNY over the past
'ive years. Carey's proposed
9308] budget is asking fora 526.3

that the buses had yet to miss a con-

nection and‘ were running on time.

“Because of the use of ovcrtimcs

and the fact that we haven't been
plagued with sickness, we've been
running on full schedule.” he said.

in the same breath though.
Stevens warned that the situation
might not go on forever. Citing the
ever-increasing number of students
living off-campus and the hiin
prices of gasoline, Stevens estimates
that bus usage is up 20 percent over
the same time period last ycar.
while the resources available to
operate the buses have not increas-
ed at all.

Students are apparently feeling
the increase. “We get squeezed iti
there," said Rita Rasmussen. a
junior living on Alumni Quad.
“Buses will pass you at a stop

without even slowing down. just
stuffed with people. Sometimes six
will pass you by." That is a com-
mon complaint of bus users, and
many blame the scheduling. not
lack of buses or manpower.

“Tlte buses may be running on
the schedule. but that doesn’t mean
the crowds will be less." says
sophomore Tracey Toback. of
Almuni's Waterbury Hall.
“Schedules just don't fit class
times. Tlterc are too few buses run-
ning to handle the peak times for
goittg uptotvn. or coming back
down iii the afternoon."

Students agree that those "peak
times" include the hoursbefore
9:45 a.m. classes on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. 10:00 a.m. on Monday.
Wednesday. and Friday. and after
12:30 and 3:30 classes iii the after-

 

 

tillion decrease iti SUNY expen-
itures. SUNY's base budget must
be decreased by Sl2.3 million while
314 million is being eliminated for
purposes of reexamination.

An expected 2200 position cut iii
43" may result in the elin‘tinat'ion
\f close to 100 academic depart-
nents. SUNY campuses may also
be eliminated -

The teach-in served to point out
'tat while this budget cut is possibly
urting the quality of SUNY educa-
-on, state spending is being raised
.y almost $600 million. Teach-in at-
:ndants questioned the reason for

-.UNY being treated as a
)ureaucratic department rather
than an educational institution.

In addition. people learned that
Syracuse University. a private in-
stitution. is receiving $15 million in
state aid funds to build a domed
athletic stadium.

SA President Lisa Newmark, ad-
dressing the problems imposed by
the budget said she met with

University Council last week to‘re-
quest assistance in stopping the
cuts. According to Newmark. the
Council claimed it could do
nothing. She said she could “really
see that we are all pawns and it's in—
furiating.

“I hope that you're all as angry
and frustrated as I am." she added.

“The teach-in also instructed

students and faculty on ways they ‘
could individually stop the budget
cuts. Making appointments with
state senators and parents writing
letters to Carey and senators. are

noon. Most Alumni students said
they leave at least 45 minutes to an
hour early in order to arrive for
classes on time. '

“it’s impossible to get a bus for a
9:45 or 10:00 class unless you go out
to the bus stop an hour ahead of
time. Either that. or i_ have to walk
up to Washington and take the bus
all the way around." Rasmussen
said. Waterbury resident Debbie
Whuley says. “l'vc even walked
home from school after 12:30
classcs'. Rather than wait. I'll walk
and be less aggravated." _.

According to Stevens. the Plan
Department is trying to work accor-
ding to student needs. He says
changes have been made in SClICdUi‘
ing. especially for tltc Tuesday and
Thursday tttortiing slots. Students
wonder. however. to what extent
changes are being made. and they
continue to complain.

from which they can hit Iran and
Pakistan by air." There's one more
thing. He claims the Soviets want
the ability to blockade the Strait of
Hormuz; through that strait must
pass most of the world's cu.

And he says the Russians covet
these things in the name of the peo-
ple. “The Marxists say Marxism is
the true representative of the
workers. Most people are
workers." But Ahmad is quick to
mention that the merchants 'who
closed down their shops in protest

says. “but they miscalctiltttcd. lti

rilla war. you don't know who the

The Russians will finally give up

talk about is peace. l'liat peace will
require a representative of a single
Afghan government as at
negotiator. Suclt it govet'niitcnt will
take the form of a coalition. unify-
ing about fifteen Afghan factions.

“I know that coalitions are shaky
governttients,” Ahmad admits. “it
would have to be a federal type of
government. not centralized. It
Would have to follow for regional
autonomy."

That's because the Moslcms are
Iict'ccly independent. As rebels.
even the Mujaltadecn cannot be
called partisans; they are more loyal
to tribal attd religions ties than to
any goternmcnt.

Past Afghan _L'tt\L‘I'lllI\i.'Ills' have

“Karmal is a statue of it foreign
power. I‘m sure that in six tnotttlts
or so. he will be assassinated. Then

“It will involve the US, Iran.
