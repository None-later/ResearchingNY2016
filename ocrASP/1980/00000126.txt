Reacting to what that consider to
be serious inter-ta] problems. stu-
dent members of SUNYA'S
Veteran's Administration (V.A)
met Wednesday to voice their
grievances.

Meeting in Campus
Fireside Lounge. two veterans com-
plained of student apathy generated
by the Administration. According
to student veteran Jim Ltnahan.
“The apathy shown by the students

‘ is just a reaction to the apathy they
encounter by the Administration."

Pryor said he is responsible for
2100 veterans. of whom less than
200 are SUNYA students. He said
that when he was placed on campus
in l974. there were 780 veterans
with two full-time \’.A. represen-
tatives working on campus. in that
year. New York had the highest
enrollment of veterans in institu-

In a projected average week. ac-
cording to Pryor, the V.A. would
like to see 30 people in its ofﬁce.
This means that each veteran would
have to appear in that ofﬁce at least
once a month. he said. In reality.
Pryor said. he has had two inquiries
in the past ten weeks. the lowest in
three years. "Taxpayers ivouldn't
support a full~time representative in
view of the current ﬁgures." said
Pryor.

According to Pryor. the represen-
tatives are working under a five-
year program. due to endain Oc-
tober of I980. After that. he said.
there will be no more federal fun-
ding for \’.A. representatives and
the program will be eliminated
around the country. “With that in

According to Haffncr, however,
these figures are misleading.

At the time of the Governor’s

was not expected to be completed.

So far. there is no indication
from the Governor's office that
Carey favors restoring the cuts.

Haffncr is optirnistlc that the cuts

Man was created in free will. God could have
loved Himself more perfectly than anyone
outside Him could love Him. But self-love is
the essence of aloneness. of evil. God. Who
is good itsell. has the essence of good love
and happiness - the love ol someone outside
of self who can return that love. So He
created man. a being with the ability to return
love. But man (lid not have to. For it man had
to (lo gootl and love God. God would in effect
inst be loving Himself by remote control. In
other words. ll God dirt not allow men to do

CPCA Seeks Tenure Revisions

by Douglas Kohn

SUNYA's Council on Promo-
tions and Continuing Appointment
(CPCA) is currently considering
new criteria for granting tcrture and
promotions in the University.

CPCA Chair Mark Berger is ad-
vocating a University-wide teacher
evaluation. similar to the Assess-
ment of Courses and Teachers
(ACT), an SA-based evaluation
program.

Berger explaittcd he is seeking a
system which would standardize the
granting of torture and promotions.
rather than the current procedure
which varies in each academic

department. He wants a
“consistent” and “non-arbitrary"
program.

“Anyone coming to teach at
SUNYA ought to know exactly
what the rules for promotion are.
They should not be dealt with in an
arbitrary way." said Berger. “The
mark of a just system is consisten-
cy. and that's what we're aiming for
iti establishing a criterion."

CPCA subcommittee member
Suc Gold said the proposed changes
are ttimed tll putting more emphasis
on excellence in teaching. “This is a
big reason why students decide to
go to a university. and we want to

make sure the best teachers are kept
on,” she said.

Gold also stressed the necessity of
competent advisement on the part
of professors. “Too many students
go through four years of screw-ups
in advisement and we’re aiming to
improve that record," she added.

Recommendations are currently
utider subcommittee consideration.
If approved by CPCA as a whole.
the proposal will be brought before
the University Selnate in April. Ac-
cording to Berger. however, chang-
ing the existing criteria is a “long.
tcdius. and uncertain process."

According to Scxcr, only eight of
