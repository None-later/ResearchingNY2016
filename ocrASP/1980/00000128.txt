We open a book and We’re in Ancient Greece trading

and the bang bang boys from Brixton in London get that

 

Homerisms with the Pericles crowd. We .put on a recorj

yaya's out or we hear sad songs from southern men. G I
to the movies and~dlscover the world: Japan, L A., Paris;
the sands of Arabia, the savannahs- of Africa ~ we cant
really get around. But how often do we look arm nd us?j
Inevitany as vacations approach we think of sunktstl,
Florida; or we wait for weekends in Montrea‘-Boston-i
New York. Anyplace but here. But here, Alb' ry, is it.
This is America. This is the world. This is the Universe;
Casablanca may have more romantic connotations
than. Troy (New York), but both share ‘a common ele-
ment — it is this element Which makes anywhere a

Look at the buildings. The old Dutchstyled elabora-i
tions, the brownstones downtown, even the model—
suburbia of Pine Hills. But do more, listen to the walls.
They reverberate with rollicking wooden wagons on cob-
blestone streets. They echo with birth cries and death
groans. They tell of lovers' sighs and mothers’ sighs and
muffled weeping from the third floor and even laughter
beside the Christmas tree. i
Embrace the world, the sublime diversity of Man onl
Earth. and the simplicity of a walk in Washington Park
watching dogs fetch sticks and statues get suntanned.
Don't lock yourself in a tower or, worse, in a schedule.
Break out, take off, go downtown and walk around. ab-
sorb some history. You may find something wonderfuls
You may even begin to appreciate buildings: structured
design: space — even empty spaces. You may eyen see
the symmetrically beautiful but imaginativer limited
SUNY Albany. Get some exposure.

The next time you ponder on an Aegean shore or
wander down the yellow brick road, remember Albany is
everywhere. There's no place like home.
