the worldwide fuel crisis just might
be found in an exotic organism or
algae.

The magazine says that selective
plant breeding and genetic engineer-
ing techniques could result in a
brand new kind of organism

sea water.‘into rcady-to-use
gasoline.

The magazine points out that a
tree itt Brazil has already been
discovered that produces usable
diesel fuel. It also notes that
University of Miami researchers
recently perfected a blue-green
algae called “Miami B-G—47" that
produces hydrogen fuel from sea
water and suttligltt.

The magazine concludes:
"Fuel-producing plant crops may
be art exotic concept and yet may lie
‘not so far off as tltc let century.
