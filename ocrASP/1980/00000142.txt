The Albany Student Press is now developing a large supplement
to be published in May concerning the history of SUNYA (from 8
Teachers College in 1848 to the present)

The edition will attempt to encompass a complete perspective of
the University. It will deal with the original plans, actualities, and
future of SUNYA: her youth. culture, groups, sports, and much

more.

We feel that this information is important and useful knowledge
for the entire academic community.

But we need your perspective, your insights, data, and
knowledge. '

In our attempt to capture every aspect that has molded SUNYA,
we would like you to contact us if you have a contribution.

All information will be welcomed.

Please call Rich Behar at the ASP
457-3322/ 3389 ‘

or Tom Martello at 482-5788.

We'll be looking forward to hearing
from you soon. -

Let's all uncap a buried treasure!
