Elston Howard’s Promotion Deserves Notice

I-‘T. LAUDERDALE (AP) it was a
news item that went virtually un-
noticed recently: “Elston Howard,
longtime coach of the New York
Yankees. elevated to administrative
assistant by owner George Stein-
brenner."

it was a story that deserved
greater attention. Howard is black.
Baseball has been shaken recently
by charges on the part of inﬂuential
black stars — Hank Aaron. Frank
Robinson and Lou Brock. par-
ticularly — of discrimination in the
appointment of blacks to ad-
ministrative and responsible posi-
tions.

“When a black man's playing
career is over. lte has no place to go
in the game." says Brock. “There’s
not even a black third base coach
much less a manager." argues
Robinson. Aaron, the all-time
home run king. spurned an award
ceremony attended by Commis-
sioner Bowie Kuhn because of what
he called inequities ill tlte sport.

Now a black man has moved iltto
the executive quarters of one of
baseball’s most successful teams.
and both employee and employer
contend it is not a token gesture.

“George assured me 1 wouldn’t
have to stand in the corner." says
Howard. “I believe hint. 1 wouldn't
take it under such circumstances."

“1 never thought about color.”
insisted Steinbrenner. “Color
should never be a factor. The only
thing one should consider is
qualifications. Howard filled the
qualifications 1 wanted for the
job."

Howard has no reason to believe
otherwise. After all, this wasn't a
spontaneous act. spurred by the ris-
ing black protest. Steinbrenner ltad
tried to lure the former All—Star cat-
clter into tltc front office five or six
years ago. “it was 1974 or 1975. we
were still playing out games at Shea
Stadium.” Howard recalled. "Mr.
Stcinbrertner canle to tile and asked
it‘ 1 would be interested in an ad-
ministrative assignment he had in
mind."

“I turned him down. 1 told him
lit the little that l‘d prefer to stay in
tile field. ‘Okay. liliie.‘ he told llle.

‘Let me know if you ehattge your
mind.’ "

The Yankee owner reinstigated
the proposition over the winter.
Howard, who was away from the
club last season. seriously ill with lllt
infection in his cllesl. listened.
thought the matter over carefully

and agreed. “You will be with me."
Steinbrenner told him.

“For a long time 1 have admired
Ellie’s character and executive
potential." Sleinbrcner said. “1
have fottr areas I want him to work
in. l dbn't wish to specify. But
when we are planning our learns

arid programs. he is at my side."

Howard was elated OVer the pro-
spect.’

“1 will visit the farm club cities.
such as Columbus. Nashville. and
Fort Lauderdale." he said. “1 will
do somepublic relations things ——
speeches and dinners — and work
with the organizations.

“Occasionally. 1 will put on a
uniform and take the field. 1 want
to do that. [Other times 1 will be
upstairs with Mr. Steinbrenner."
