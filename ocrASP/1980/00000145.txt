play. l'liis is what the Albany State
riieii's volleyball team discovered iii

of l‘echitology on Saturday.

Albany was originally scheduled
to attend the li-ilrackct ‘l‘otu‘na—

taut coach .liimie Mcl-arland that

cording to Mcl’arland.‘ included the
best volleyball tcaitts iii the east.

ed up to the A»llrackct to avoid
playing easy teams. We really had
little expectation ot' doing well."

l‘he format of the tournament re-
quired that one teatii play each ot'
five different teams (out of twelve
that were present) tuicc. In
Albany's case these the were: Yale.

Lieorgc Mason ('ollege. Once the
preliminary matches had etidcd. tlte
teams with the best won-loss
records of the tournament advanc-
ed to the tournament playoffs.

The first team that Albany had to
fttcc was Yale. Although Albany
fell behind early, the teiiiii gelled
later on in the first game and as

 

Mcl’arland described, “ended tip
crushing them.” So. Albany had
begun its quest towards a tourna-
rncnl playoff spot with two victories

A Election Cover-Up

 

Presidential Ballot; Fixing Claimed

Ex~Eiection official Mitch Davis

by Thomas Murtcilo

Mitchell Davis says it was all a
joke.

But you won't hear much
laughter at Student Association.

A claim by Davis last spring that
be stuffed the ballot box in favor of
Lisa Newmark iii the SA presiden-
tial run-off election has sent shock
waves up and down the organiza-
tion and resulted in one ol' the most
widespread cover-ups iii recent SA
history.

Davis told several Newmark s'up—
porters that while he was as ant
election commissioner on lndiau
Quad. lte replaced 15 votes for
Newmark's opporterit. Sharon
Ward. with the same number of
Newmark votes. Newmark subse-
quently won the election by a
90—vote margin.

Davis, who graduated in May
and currently lives in Oceanside.
denied last night that he had stuffed
tlte ballot box arid said that he was
joking when ltc said that he did.
However. the Newtiiark supporters
believed [tint and feverishly set into
motion a cover-up which would
eventually involve many proiiiiucrtt
members of SA.

SA Controller Craig Weinstock.
Central Council internal Affairs
Chair .Iim Mitchell and Central
Council member Mark Lafayette
agreed the night Newmark was
elected that they would not inform
the cicctiori cotnttiissioner or
Newmark about what they believed
had happened. 'l‘hrec former SA
members also concurred at the
meeting —- Jim Castro-Blanco. Ab-
bic'Havkins. and Ron Frank.

Eventually. at least a dozen other
members of student government
learned about it. yet all of them
kept quiet. Newntark was informed
Monday night after it becarue ap-
parent that the story was going to
hit the press.

Davis. who supported Newmark
in the election. was asked by former
election commissioner .lariet Mitr-
pliy to sit at the election site on lit-
diaii Qttad after several people had
backed ottt at the very last riiitiiite.
According to Murphy. she find no
choice but to use supporters of the
candidates as assistant elcetioti
commissioners in charge of the

quads. She said that she ptit stip-
portcrs of both camps on the quads
to keep -ach .sidc honest.

tnittiite." said Murphy. “There was
nothing else i could do under those
circumstances "

Davis agreed to sit on lndian
Quad along with some Ward sup-
porters. Neither Davis or Murphy
could remctnber who the Ward .sup-
porters were.

Davis agrccd to sit on indiati
Quad along with sortie Ward sup-
porters. Neither Davis itor Murphy
could remember who the Ward stip-
portcrs were.

“i was really pretty detached
frorn the race." said Davis. “1 real-
ly didn't give a damn what was go~
ittg on. After i had dotic the elec—
tion, someone said to me 'My God,
you cotiid have stuffed the ballot
box.‘ Aritl i said. ‘Sure i did.’ I
figured it would be my last prank."

Davis said lie cottldn't remember
who he had spoken to. "It was so-
nicone who thought lie was really
iriiportant on Central Cotiiicii and i
said to myself that this guy might
cvcti fall for it. Sometimes I say
things in such a manner that people
don't know whether it's the truth or
not. l don't know whether I
believed or not. But that's my pet-
.s'ouality. l was laid back and sar-

easlic. People would have to think
twice about it. i suppose someone

Davis added. "But no. i didn‘t
do it."

Someone who knew Davis and
believed his ciairri was a friettd. .lirit
Mitchell. a strong Newmark stip-
porter.

Mitchell said that Davis called
him and told hint that he bad .stuff-
ed the ballot box.

‘fHe was very happy." He was
going ‘ho ho ho. gotta tell you
something'." said Mitchell. "Then
lie lays it on rue like he had just kill-
cd Sharon Ward.”

Mitchell added that it didn't oc-

cur to liiiri that Davis might have
been joking.
. “I believed hint." he said last
night. “lint I doti't find it hard to
believe that he made it up. if Mit—
clieli [Davis] did make it up. he was
playing a little game."

Mitchell said that “my first reac-
tion was fear — someone cotiid
have seen him do it stupid thing.“
When asked if he gave Davis the im-
'ion that he believed him. Mit—

 

.chell said. “i only remember what i
felt. i don't remember what i said
or did."

Havkins, who graduated in May.
’l‘hree others soon learned about the
'ciaim: Lafayette. Frank. and
Castro-Blanca. A meeting was held
in Newntark's suite on Colonial
Quad by these six individuals.
When Frank and Castro-Blanca

mentioned they might tell Newmark
or Murpiiy about what they knew.
Weinstock became upset. "When
we were iii the suite," said Frank,

“Craig said to us ‘Lisa does not

know. So she’s not responsible.

Once .she knows. she’s responsible.

Anyone who tells Lisa is on my list.’

it was a physical threat — no doubt
about it. Craig threatened everyone
in that damn rooitt. That should be
clear. I Wits scared of his threat."

"‘Craig Weinstock was
distraught." said Mitchell. He
blew his top, he threatened
something. But we calmed hint

down and began to talk rationally."

Weinstock arid Mitchell then
convinced those at tile meeting that
if Newmark Won by a substantially
larger margin than tlte number of
votes allegedly changed. nothing
should come out about it.

"We mutually decided to tell ott-
ly if the outcome was affected."
said Lafayette. “Knowing that it
