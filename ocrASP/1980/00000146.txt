Studies Program Finances

by Aron Stnltlt

The uncertain future of Universi-
ty programs and academic depart-.
ments in tlte shadow of extensive
proposed hudch cuts is very ntttclt
on tltc mind of SUNYA President

Vincertt O'Leary. In an effort to]

evaluate the funding requirements
of tltese programs, O'Leary ap-
pointed an eighteen-member'nd-
visory committee Wednesday night.
Tlte group. consisting of studertts.
faculty attd staff. will make recom-
mendations to be used by O'Leary
as he decides upon the distribution
of funds for the cotrtittg fiscal year.

All cornrttittcc members. chosen
by O’Leary in cortjttrtction with the
University Senate Executive Corn-
ntittcc, have previously served on
one of four advisory panels
(Academic Affairs. Business and
Finance, Research, Uttiverstty Af-
fairs). The fottr groups were each
rcsportsible to tire vice president
having jurisdiction over lltc respec-
wltolc. In tt rttemorandum to

PR Prof. Dismissal Evaluated

 

Student-Faculty Committee Formed

by Susan Mllllgatt

As promised to tire SUNYA
Third-World Student Coalitiort.
Prcsidettt Vincent O'Leary has up»
poitttcd tltrcc faculty tncrnbers arid
two students to a special panel to irr-
vcstigatc tltc ntoti 'ations behind the
controversial dismissal of Ptterto
Rican Studies Professor Juan A.
Silcn.

The formation of the pattcl was a
reaction to the Coalition's recent
3-day demonstration iii the office of
Pucrto Rican Studies Department
Chair lilia (.‘hr‘istianscn.

liorntcr Social Sciences D'an
Richard Kcrtdall decided last May,
as rccotttrttcttdcd by Christiansen.
to dismiss Silcn. Sensing possible
bias. the Third World Strident
(‘oalitiort. led by Tito Martinez.
decided to take actiort to reinstate
Silcn.

“We feel

Silen is tltc most

qualified professor itt the depart-
ment." said Martinez.

Kendall declirtcd to state the
reasons behind the decision to
dismiss Silcn.

Neither Cltristiartscn rtor Silcn
could be reached for cotntttcrtt.

The partcl. comprised of students
Karen l-lttmbrick arid Carmello
Vcrdcjo. and Professors Armand
Baker, Alvin Mogid. artd Roberts,
will review tlte issues ofSilcn's case.

SUNYA President Vincent
()'|cary said. “The panel will in-
vestigate course evaluations, any
personal. political. or ideological
factors which ntigltt haV‘ affected
Ihc decision and the consultation
process betwcctt the chairperson
and other faculty members."

According to Martinez, the coali-
tiott suspects that tltc recommenda-
tions for Silctt's dismissal rttay ltavc
bcctt a career move on the part of
other Pucrto Rican Studies pro-
fcssors.

“No one itt tltc department has

I tenure." said Martinez. “The corti-

 

 

rttittee will see if the failure to rchire
Silcn was a tnovc to eliminate corn-
petition for tenure."

Martinez fttrtlter reﬂected ltc
feels “Silen has art edge . . . Chris-
tiansen's degree is in pharmacy urtd
sociology. rtot irt Pttcrto Ricnn
Studies, as Silcn has."

The committee will make a
recommendation to O‘Leary by
April 7th. O’Leary said if ltc feels
there were bias it) the previous deci-
sion. Silcn's post will be reinstated
within two weeks.

The coalition has also bcgtttt
working on another. broader, ad-
visory corrttnittec with Vice Presi-
dcttt of Academic Affairs Dave
Martin. The members of the corn-
rttittee. to be deterrttittcd by Mort—
dtty, will be responsible for the
l’ucrto Rican Studies Department's
goals attd priorities. as well as the
future leadership of the depart-
rncrtt.

Judaic Studies Department pro-
fessor Alatt Ytttcr has been all bttt
officially denied tcnttrc for his posi-
tion by the department. The ﬁnal
vote rests with SUNYA President
O'Leary, whoru Ytttcr believes will

This tltctne dcrtinl has followed

surrounding the lack of contract

the functions of the committee as'
“reviewing the recommendations of
the four partcls relative to increas-
ittg or decreasing resources in
various schools and departments.
and to reconcile arty differences
among tltc panels.“

“This is the first tirtte we've put
representatives of the panels
together to look ttt the campus."
said O'Leary. “This has sortie im-
plications. It gives as somewhat ofa
hasc relative to what happens irt the
legislature."

“Obviously. when u budget is
passed, the University will have to
be prepared somehow to live with
the budget," said History Professor
Kendall Birr. a committee member.
"it’s very hard to tell wltat the
hudget‘s going to be like. But I
don’t rttect very tnany people who
are convinced that the lcgislatrtrc
will restore rtll of the cuts that the
Governor tirade to the budget."

While O'Leary is concertth with
tile fiscal ramifications of potential-
ly scverc cutbacks itt Governor
Httglt Carey's 1980-!” Executive
Budget, ltc stresses that the panel
findings may result iii the injection
of funds irtto programs calling for
such action. Placing SUNYA pro»
grams ittto perspective will resttlt itt
fittartcial additions for some anti
reductions for others. he said.

“The Governor's bttdgct plan has

mospheric Sciences Professor
Harry Hamilton. "The only thing.

Professor May Be Denied Tenure

lsser said. “We want ltitn very bad—
ly to app -al this fall. because we ex—
pect him to have finished the work
lie is ttow iii the process of corti-
plcting."

According to lsser. Ytttcr got
“caught in rt situation that gave him
less than usual before his tenure
came up" to complete his work.
“Normally a professor has six years
at the llrtiversity (SUNYA) to get
established before his tenure comes
up. unless ltc has served as it pro-
fessor in another university." The
main criteria for such establishment
is publishing sortie acadcrnic~tcltttcd
ntalcrial.

Ytttcr previously served two years
as art assistant professor at
Baltimore Hebrew College. As a
result. lsser said, Ytttcr has lost

was left with a four-year trial period
at SUNYA. A year after lie was
hired. tltc university passed a policy

They're certainly not going to

obviously the panel will have to

Although Birr claims that

be indicated that recommendations
will probably closely follow the
release of the state budget.

"1 think we‘re probably expected
to do the job fairly quickly, since
the expectations are that the
legislature will approve the budget
by April I." said Birr. "in the 28
years that l‘ve been hereI however.
there have been a couple of years
when the legislature didn't pass a
budget until sometime toward the
end of. May."

According to Birr. committee
members will gain a broader
perspective of the University as they
examine the reports of panels with
which they were not originally in~
volvcd.

“l. for example, will have the op—
portttrrity to compare support ser-
vices with business and finance,” he
said.

ltirr claims that many programs
will probably remain at their cur-
rcttt funding levels. experiencing
neither cutbacks rtor endowments.

“Most of the areas should pro-
bably be stayed state." ltc said.
“It's obvious that there is not going
to be any tnorc money around and
We're going to have to examine the
budget applications attd wishes of
every office at the University."

Conunittce rttetttber Susan Sher-
man of SUNYA‘s School of Social
Welfare stressed the irnportattcc of
O'Leary‘s committee as “a way of
ltavirtg faculty input ittto sortie very
difficttlt budget decisions."

Hamilton is cotrfidcrrt that the
group will stlccced in this objective.
“This is an advisory grottp. It. by
definition. will aclticvc its pur-
pose." he said. “Its purpose is to
give advice to the President. It will
do that. It will meet; it will consider
material; it will give a report.
Tltcrcforc, it has achieved its pur-
pose of rendering advice.“

“Everyone wants to keep the
University at Albany as strong as
possible," said llirr. “What cart we
do with tltc limited resources
available to keep the University as
strong and vital as possible?"

was rtot retroactive when Yutcr was
hired, restricting him to the original

Ytttcr is currently irt the final
stages of producing art analysis of

dichevsky. The work sltonld be

appeal next fall.

Iss aid, “We have reason to be
confident that the appeal will be
successful.“ attd added that “there
is u lot ofgood fttith involved in this
case." He feels that Ytttcr's work.
when completed, will be sufficient
evidence of his importance to the
department.

The members of tire department
echoed this sttpport in their 8—0 vote
itt favor of his bid for tenure. while
tltc University Senate voted against
it.
