Nuclear Alert

Some 200 physicians and Nobcl
prize winners have taken out a full
page advcrisement in The New
York Times warning President
Carter and Soviet Chair Leonid
Brezhnev of what they call the un-
paralleled horrors of nuclear war.

They claim that a riitclear war,
even a so-eallcd “limited one."
wottld result itt death. injury and
disease on a scale that has no prece-
dctit iii the history of human ex-
istence.

The ad warns that a single 20
riicgaton thermonuclear bomb ex-
ploded above art eastern US city
would create a fireball onc-aritLa-
half tnilcs wide, with temperatures
of 20 to 30 million degrees
t'ahrcnlicit. According to the
message: "livcrything iii the
dowritowti area. Ilie streets and the
earth below and all the living things
woirld he vapori/ctl. leaving a crater
several lnindrcd feet deep."

It adds that: “I'Iospitals would be
destroyed and iriost medical person—
nel would be among the dead and
injured. There would be ritillions of
L‘ttt‘|tsi"s. Food. air and water would
be contaminated. Survivors would
die from slat\tttion. dehydration.
radiation sickness and infections."

llic sponsors of the ad. an
tit't‘lllll/ltlltlll citllvrl I’li)sicians for
Social Responsibility. \ays they
hope to riicct \vttli Carter and
lire/lines to discuss the medical
consequent-cs oI nuclear war."

CIA Secret Source

   

The Central Intelligence Agency
is alleged to have worked with
spiritual mediums in the late l960's

.n an effort to make contact with
dead agents. . .

Former CIA Executive Assistant
Victor Marchctti. who reports this
allegation, says these efforts were a
part of a larger plan on the part of
the agency to harness psychic
powers for various intelligence-
related missions.

Other experiments. Marcltetti
adds, included tests on clairvoyants
who attempted to read the minds of
Kremlin leaders.

Previous secret CIA documents
obtained by High Times magazine
reveal that as far back as the late
1940s. the CIA was ill contact with

‘One 1953 memo indicates that the
CIA went so far as to infiltrate
seances and other spiritual gather-
ings in an effort to locate in-
dividuals with true ESP or
telepathic powers.

As one CIA scientist put it: [fit is
possible to “identify the thought of
another person several hundred
miles away. the adaptation to prac-
tical requirements for obtaining
secret information should not give
serious difficulty."

It is believed that CIA interest in
ESP continues to this day. although
agency officials refuse to comment
on the nature of such research.
