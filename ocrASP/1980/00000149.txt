As the youth of America attempts to come
to grips uith the question of u hat to do in the
«em of the draft. the need for rsolution of
the individual and group moral and practical
problems is becoming more and more urgent.
One of the mosr prching issues is the ques—
tion of “What is north ﬁghting for?"

Man) young people, uom'ed about the
draft. are quick to ansner "\"othing is worth
dying for!" or more accuratel}. "Nothing is
north risking no life for!" But upon reflec-
tion of the consequences of this attitude. one
can see that it ts a dangerous and short-
sighted one, indeed. For. uho in his right
mind uould prefer submitting to the “hints
of foreign ttttlitar) might than enjoying the
protection of the L Constitution?

Good 'ole Alhan) State would ptobabli not

UAS and Rhetoric

To the Bdllor: * .

Webster's dictionary deﬁnes rhetoric as us-
ing words and language effectively. Yet. in
the March ll editorial. “Rhetoric on the
Home Front," one line in particular strikes
me as being an outrage to effective and
honest communication. “SUNYA board
rates haic just been increased, has the food
quality done the same?” in light ofthc entire
editorial. it “(mid appear that you are en-
couraging students to question those actions
that directl) effect us. which in itself is great.
Yet here you intimated that the board rate
bike “as not justified. and that students
should be outraged arid take appropriate ac-
tion. Did iou bother to read the article iii the
presious issue of tlte ASP mplaitiing “by
board rates had to go ttp',’ lltat social scCltril}

it is not )our tespotisihilit) to kttuu the facts

reading your (inn newspaper? I rettli/c that
this “as onli one sentence iii the editorial. jvcl
it scnes to “bad mouth" (M 5. Much.
frankl). I am tired of hearing.

If the food is so terrible and thcre appeah

I applaud the plea for on campus student
actiiism. but before criticizing. at least get
the facts straight. and remember that there
are students on the L'AS Board of Directors

To the Editor:

Since l began attending S.L'.t\'.\'..»\. iztxl

to find etidetice of this is to gltitice illtllll‘ti
