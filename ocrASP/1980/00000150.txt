sight. Whether something liew has or will replace it is
beyond our present ken. lut something we once had,
held preciously, had a faint. in, trusted, swore by, died
for, that is gone. i -

It was nationalism: a commitment to the slogans, sym-
bols, and artifices of the United States. Nationalism, a
stubborn belief, was often most rigorously revered by
those who were ignorant of, or ignored, the values, con-
cepts, and ideals that the Founding Fathers expressed. It
is harder to sit down and understand Jefferson,
Hamilton, Madison, Adams, Paine, Franklin, and
Washington than it is to get up and march in a parade
waving the flag, singing the anthems, blessing the virgin
Statue of Liberty. An inevitable inverse ratio exists bet-
ween nationalistic fervor and true understanding; the
more slogan swearing, the less appreciation of the ideas
in the Constitution; the more red, white, and blue, the
less Locke, Rousseau, and Pericles.

Yet today, in an interim between nationalistic periods,
we see true Revolutionary spirit in the Anti-Nuke, Con-
servationist, Anti-Corporate Tyranny and the other pro—
test groups that most of us pass by in the Campus Center.
The freedom to dissent from popular belief, the will»
ingness to accept change when necessary, and the op-
portunity to grow are the principles of Revolutionary
America.

Let's hope we have lost a naive and blind trust in the
superficial pomp which some have used to replace the
true American ideology. Our only hope for the future is
to return to the basic precepts of this still experimental
democrasy. We must commit ourselves to and respect
everybody's right to change, freedom, and opportunity.
