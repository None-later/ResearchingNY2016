Drafting Women

continued from page 5o

vanced military branch, employs about
53.000 women. Only four of the 230 Job
categories are closed to women-aerial gun~
ners. ground controllers of combat air strikers.
security for air-base security. and troops that
rescue downed pilots and Cruwmcn. But.
Women fly tankers. are being trained to deal
with intercontinental ballistic missiles and it is
possible that by 1985. 1 out of every 6 women
members will be fighting members. if the draft
is Issued.

Yet, with the increase of women's involve-
ment in the military. equality has not yet been
granted in full, And with this fact in mind.
many women have expressed anti—draft con-
cerns. In opposition are those women who
feel a call for the draft is a need which will
bolster their rights for equality.

Barbara Brundage. Albany Chapter Presi-
dent of the National Organiratiori of Women.
is opposed to the draft for both sexes. but Is

\ especially concerned with the idea that
women should fight for a government which
oppresses women and minorities. "The U.S. is
run by a patriarchy. We feel It is especially tiri-
fair for women to into the service when we're
not even fully represented In the country."

As for drafting women to secure the ERA
some women feel conscription should not be
the basis for granting equality. “I feel that draf-
ting women will help ERA in a false box.
because drafting people makes them slaves.
Drafting women would bring false equality,"
claims Marge Rusk. a voluntary draft-military
counselor with the American l‘riends of Ser-
vice Committee.

"I don't think women should be drafted first
to prove themselve worthy of women's
rights." she added.

SUNYA'S Affirmative Action Associate

Gloria DeSole said. “I don't believe women ,

should be asked to serve a country that isn’t
serving us. And It would be a mistake to ex-

   

pect the ERA, It's a foolish and dangerous
idea.H

But. according to Joyce Hart. President of
the Albany Council of Business and Profes-
sional Women, the draft needs to be issued If
Women want the ERA. Recently. the national
CBPW called for draft legislation. claiming if
women want equality. conscription Is a stepp-
ing stone in its direction. “if women want to be
treated as equals, if they want the ERA. the
draft Is needed as long as they want to be
equals." said Hart. She added that women In
the military may advance professionally ll.)
gain equal rank with males.

Many believe if females are to be drafted.
they should be allowed to serve in combat.
citing their abilities to handle themselves well
physically. But. the general consensus Is that

the military branches will only give women'

“desk jobs." Current statistics can uphold this
belief.

As for war in general, there is great concern
that a conventional war will never materialize
—— nuclear war seems to be the final end.

"The idea of a conventional war is so dated.
it's a fantasy. The next war will be the end,

.. _, I .
stresses Debole. And Hart, quoting front the
_ New Yorker magazine. says “In the nuclear

age. women tire already in the front lines."
(.v icws on drafting women and the draft in
general vary among political figures,
Elizabeth Holtzman. US. Rupresentive and
sponsor of the resolution to extend the ratifica-
tion period of the ERA three years Stild. “l dill
against the draft in general, I think
Women in the question over their involvement
in the draft is ti distraction from lliL' issue."

The views of state Senator Cill’tll Builntin
(D'l.dWrct)CC) are a bit more mtidurniv,

"1 don't think that it registration could be if“:
prripcr response in this case." she said referr-
lrig to the Afghnnastuii crisis. “But women
should be drafted with men In an emergency.
regardless of whether it's passed."

State Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan
(Fl-Brooklyn) fully advocates registration and
its inclusion of women.

“I hope we don't have to draft men or
women. says Sullivan. “But l am In favor of
registration for both; if we are to draft men.
then we must draft women."
