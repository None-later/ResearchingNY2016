For the first time, I'm sitting here
not knowing what to write. There's a
few people around you could bark
at but not much else to going on. I

but really It‘s Just half be un and
good times are sure to be a lg part
of it (even If they haven‘t been so
far). Just loklng around, of course. I
hope you enjoy your lilthll And now
to end with your favorite take: What
does Superman do every rnornln 7
