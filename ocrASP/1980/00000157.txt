Dimes 21-6 Season 13' “Most; Surprising”

‘Inheriting the center position
from Cavanaugh. ‘Jones proved to
be a tower ofstrength for the Danes
all season long. He was supposed to‘
rehotirtd, and ire did — 6.7 per
game. the team leader, Bill the 6-6
senior did more than just rebound.

more mintrtes than everyone on tile

evidenced by his ()8 percertt free

I.o\v'.s improvement was another
of Saucrs’ unexpected. but
welcome, surprises. After a meager
cortrribution a year ago. Low

However, Low‘was rtot the only
Albany player to provide stellar
performances off the bench. The
Dane reserves outscored their op-
ponents 23.3-13.7 during the season
— a margin that was responsible for
nurtrcrous Albany triuruplis. (itrard

Still. something was missing.
That link between the starters and
the reserves. The starter that wasn‘t
a starter. The reserve that wasn't a
reserve. The player that let Saners
claint “this was the strongest bench
l’ve ever had."

Oh yes. Pete Stanislr.

Despite his 9.2 scoring average,
56 percent field goal shooting arid

    

79 percent from the line..Stanish's
true worth was far less tangible. it
was his ability to spark the Dane ar-
tack — to loosen a defense with his
strong drives— that gave Albany
an ace-in—the-hole when Sauers
went to his bench.

“Pete was to me really a starter

All the pieces added up [for
Albany to advartcc us- far as the
finals of the NCAA East Regional,
where Ithcy were defeated and
elirtrinated by Potsdam, 87-72. No
Dane team ever went further, brtt

Danes were bat-l, in the beginning of
February. With those kinds of

numbers. the Danes had visions of

“ The ending was disappointing,
because i kuev. we had beaten

ATTENTIo :

 

 

 

There is only one God and only one Truth.
That Truth has been revealed to man many

that a new revelation was required, Since
followers of older revelations often did not
believe the newer ones, one result of this pro-
cess has been the forming of many religions,
each with a fragment of God's truth mixed
with man-made ideas. The Writings claim to
be the revelation that ‘gets it all together'.
unifying all the Truth fragments and pro-

than has ever been given to man.

a vast parable, containing deep and
fascinating symbolic spiritual symbolic
meanings. Seen in light of these'lnner mean-
ings. the puzzling and apparently inconsis-
tent statements of Scripture. its many ap-
parently cruel and strange stories. and its
greatamount of apparently trivial detail all
take on a dramatically new aspect. In this
spiritual light. the Bible can be soon far more
clearly than _ever before to be as iull of
goodness arid profound truth as would be we
pected in teachings of the God of the
universe.

Creation ltsell is 'a parable, a living physical
symbol of deeper spritual realities. The corn-
plox and beautiful relationships of physical
ocoraysterrrs are symbols of the even more
complex and beautiful rotations-trips of the
spiritual ecosystorrr. which in trrrn is a
parable of God.
