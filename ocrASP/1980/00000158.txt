“We had a team meeting after the
match and we all felt that we could
have beaten them, and the closeness
of the scores proves it. It was a
disappointing loss."

Even feeling they should have
beaten West Point was a positive

after us," according to Earl. West
Point raced to a 7-2 lead in the
fourth game. but the Danes came
back to tie the score at 7-7, before
West Point erupted for the neXl
eight points and the win.

Earl called the fifth game “a car-
bon copy of the first game."
Albany found themselves trailing.
11-7. but four consecutive Dane
points evened the score and shook
West Point. “We forced them to
call a titne out after we tied it tip."
said Earl. West Point then tallied
the next three points. and after four
side-outs, secured their victory.
15-1 1.

“l tbottght we served thetn excep-

pretty good effort. The ottc possible
determinant that kept us from pitte-
ing higher was Heter’s two previous
events the same day —— bttt Frank
really did pull through." said
Roberts.

Jim Colgan placed I21h in
1:00.24 in the loo yard backstroke.
“I was happy just to place in the
event with the competition on
hand. i missed breaking a mintttc
by a fraction. 1 really wanted to
break it bad but my time was tny
best and l'm happy to have scored
points for the team.”‘said Colgan.
Bonawitz placed fourth in the same
100 yard backstroke in 57.97. “i
hoped to get a third. My. turnover
on the turns wasn‘t up, yet con-
sidering how i felt. l'm pleased with
my tinte and my fourth place
finish." said lionawitz.

The final day of competition
opened up with Ahcrn's second
school record in as tnany days as he
got a tltird in the lot) yard freestyle
event in 49.36 seconds. Ahern corti-
tnented on his record and cotnpeti-
tion overall: “i thought that we
could break some school records
here at Potsdam. The competition
really fired us up and made wintting
times record times.”

Bonawitz repeated his fourth
place finish in the 100 backstroke
with another fourth iii the 200
backstroke in 2:06.84. “Steve‘s tw0
fourths was a truly tremendous and
outstanding effort." said White.

A Heter-Shore combination plac-
ed fifth and sixth. respectively. in
the 200 yard breaststroke. “Frank'
and I had sotnc real stiff cotnpeti-
tiott in the race. especially from the
two Potsdam contpetitors. l‘m kind
of disappointed with my sixth
although I did give it my best shot."

Albany a convincing setback when
the two squads met earlier in-the
season.‘ This time, West Point
registered an iii-16. 13-15. 15-8,
7-15. 11-15 victory. dropping the

tionally well." commented Earl.
“In the gantes we won we were able
to serve the ball to their poorer
passers. i felt Gary Becker played
well ~— he made a lot of blocks. and
Rob Harrington also did a good
job. West Point was ttot able to
take advantage of his height like
they did the first time we played
them."

After facing Springfield yester—
day. the Danes host Cortteli and
Syracuse tomorrow. Syracuse
recently won the Ii-open in Cor—
tland. and Cornell is “a good,
quality volleyball team." according
to Earl. “They are very small. but
they are quick and they play good
defense. We will have to play well
to beat them."

the 4(X) yard freestyle composed of
Heter, Zybala, Ahern, and Roberts.
The team placed fourth in 3:22.04.

Unable to score'for the Danes yet

was swimmer Kerry Donovan. who
summed up his feelings —— present
and future. by saying. “As a
freshman it was a great experience
to be the only one at the SUNYACs
frotn Albany. My times have really
improved immenser over the
course of the rigorous season and
l‘m looking forward to next
season's competition as Albany
strives to place even higher next
year at the SUNYACS at Ilingham-

Assistant Coach Jeff Kennedy
summed the whole season up by
saying. “l've never been more pro-
ttd of a bunch of guys. They all
came out here to do something and
they did it."
