“Not only an Albany State
record-breaking performance but a
major step forward.” said coach.
Ron White in summation of his
men’s swim team’s fourth place
showing at the SUNYAC cham-
pionships last weekend in Potsdam.

The Danes ﬁnished a three-day
tournament with a persgnal record-
breaking total of 203 points. “Last
year we came home with 155 points.
l’m ecstatic over this year's
results." said White.

Cortland won the entire meet
with a score of 424. followed by
Geneseo with 396. Potsdam (361),
Albany (203). University of Buffalo
(149). Binghamron (136), Oswego
ti07). Fredonia (76). Buffalo State
(56), and rounding out tlte field of
ten was Brockport with 3|.

Competing in the championships
takes much more preparation than
most people could ever imagine.
Each day of competition ittcludcd
excrutiating tiietital preparation,
and the Dane swimmers had only
one thing in mind — to swirtt like
they never did before.

Respective coaches loaded eaclt

event so as to get the greatest max—

days. and swimmers. so as to be

after the season was over. he
acknowledged his ntiscalculation:

put in races; usually a maximum
three races a day. l

The most eminent psychological
preparation for the meet is the ac-
tual shaving of the hair on the body
highlighted by the ultimate — shav-
ing the head. "Shaving makes your
body smoother. it makes your skin
very much like that of a porpoise."
said Dane swimmer Frank Heter.
“Shaving the hair on your body ex-
poses the nerve cndings by shaving
away the initial layer of skin. Tltc
water goes over your skirt giving
you a better. and dcfittitely the
ultimate. feel in the water."

To give an indication of how irrt-
portant shaving the head was to the
swimmers competing iii the
SUNYACs — the entire teams of
botlt Cortlartd and Potsdam along
with a vast majority of Gcncsco's
squad shaved their heads. The lone
individual for the Danes was Joe
Shore. .

Getting down to the hard facts.
the festivities opened Thursday

But they did. And Sauers. wltose
coaching surpassed his predicting.
guided the Danes to their 21-6 cam-
paign. a sccortd place ﬁnish in the
SUNYAC East. and also a playoff
appearance. it was accomplished
with no star performer — no Dane
averaged 14 poirtts a game, and six
different playe 5 split high-scoring
honors during the season. Despite
the cliche. there's no getting around
it —— it really was a team effort.

Before the season. Saucrs set

down certain necessities — things
that .would have to happen in order
for the Danes to win. These iitclud-
ed a successful return by guard
Winston Royal, a combination of
postmen to offset the loss of Barry
Cavanaugh and Carmelo Verdejo.
arid added scoring punch by
returnees Ray. Cesare and Rob
Clunc. Like magic. Satrcrs waved
his hand. and they all hecaritc
realities:
-With the return of Royal front the
Dominican Republic National
team. Albany solidified their
backcourt. and puttirtg the ball iitto
the hands of the speedy 5-9 captain
usually provided positive results.
Royal finished up his career as the
Danes' leading scorer for the season
(13.3). and his assist total of 133
was the second highest in Albany
history. Although his shooting fell
off a bit as the season wore on.
Royal was there when Albany need-
ed him rrrost — early in the year.

“Winston’s return was obvioust
important. particularly in the first
half of the season," said Strttcr's.
"lie was a great stabili/ing force
with the team. and 1 think he car-
ried the team in a lot of ways iii the
first part of the season. in the se-

Robérts took 12th in 23:51, Dave
Zybala placed 10th in 23.35 and
Kevin Ahern took an impressive
fourth in 22.58. “1 was really happy
to finish that high." said Aherti.
7“My goal was to just make the
finals (the top 6 qualificrs)."

The 400 yard medley relay —
Steve Bonawitz. Heter. Shore. and
Ahern, proved to be a competitive
combination as they placed third in
3:45.39. The time enabled them to
break the old Albany school record
in the event and ink their names in
the record book. “Even though my
time was not a solid showing. it was
a good team effort." said
backstrokcr Bonawitz. Heter felt
that it was “a tough race.
Everybody had pretty good split
times. Evert though thc‘mcdley was
seeded first coming into the
SUNYACs, we might have been
overauxious."

Diver Bill Dcrkasch ended the
first day of action'by placing a very
well-deserved fifth iii the one meter
diving with a combined score of
314.82 points. “Billy has a solid
performance. His diving is a big
breakthrough irt Albany State div-
ing." said White. Dcrkasch com-
mented on his efforts by explaining
that “the last couple of weeks the
divers don't taper in preparation
for the SUNYACs the same way as
the swimmers. The divers usually
put itt more practice than ever —

depend on hint less and less — the
team became better balanced. The
team also get stronger, and more
confident irt each otlier's ability."

OSauers realized he didn't have two
players who were capable of filling
the void created by the departure of
Cavanaugh and Verdejo. So Sauers
instead counted on four postmen —-

iitons in reserve. (.‘olléctively, they
did the job, and enabled the Danes
to out-rebound their opponents by
over five carorns per game.

year we got twenty-titree a game
between four of them. But that was
good. Their job was to hold their
own with the other postmen —- that
was our goal at the start of the year
—- and 1 think they did even better
than that."

INext came Cesare arid Clunc. Both
had been on the varsity team as
freshmen. Both were now juniors.
Both were looked to for added scor-
ing. and being veterans. added
leadership. “1 need them built to be
dotrble-figurc scorers." were
Sauers' words at the outset of the
season. You got it, coach. Cesare
tallied one riiore poirtt than Clune
over the 27 game season. as they
botlt averaged 10.4 points a game,
and they chose crucial contests to be
at their best:

The Danes found themselves
trailing Kings 42-34 early in the sc-
cond half. 11 was Albany‘s first
game of the season. and an opening
victory. especially on the road,
would give the Danes some added
confidence. llttl down by eight. the
inaugural win looked like it would
have to wait Y trrttil Chute got
started. The 0-2 swirtgnitut plowed
through the Kings defense for 14
consecutive points. guiding the
Danes to a 79-69 win. Clinic's 2‘)
points stood up as the highest scor-
ing game for arty Albany player all

seven rebounds. His performance
keyed Albany's 75-66 victory. and it

All of Sauers' "necessities" pass-
ed the tcst. Brit to go 21-6,
something else was needed. A sur-
prise of some sort. Maybe even two
surprises. Jones arid Low turned in-
to Sauers‘ surprise package. “The
big reasons for as winning 2| games
were the quick improvement of
Steve Low, the overall good season
of play from Kelvin. and the benclt
as a total. the way they came

and Steve Low are the two that ex-
cceded my expectations by the

Ncwurark “is not taking decisive

liorkowski anticipates tltc refusal
on the part of the four SA rncrnbcrs
to comply with the recommended
resignations.

liorkowski. “And Newrntuk won't

Regarding lltn‘kmvski's resigna-
