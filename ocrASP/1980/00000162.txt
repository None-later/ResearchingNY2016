A Child’s War

 

Are you ready for talking dolls
that will carry on cotttplete conver-
sations? Or for arttties of toy
soldiers that will figltt intricate hat-
tles at tlte verbal instructions of a
child?

According to The Lox Ange/ex
Times. these and similar gadgets are
expected to be in tire toy stores of
tlte 1990s.

The Tina-x says that lcadittg toy
tttakers are already experimenting
witlt computerized dolls capable of
respottdittg to virtually arty question
asked by a sis-yearmld owttcr.
What's more, tltc newspaper says.
these dolls of the Iltlllt'L‘ may be
bttilt so that they will respond to Ull~
Iy ottc voice r that of their cltild
owner ~~ while ignoring all others.

Pacific News Service reports that
the Pentagon tnay be using the cur-
rettt crises itt Afghanistan attd Iran
as a “sntokescteeu” to disguise its
real reasons for watttittg to restore
the military draft.

According to tlte tte\\s scHice.
the Defense Department is en-
cottrttering serious pt‘oblettts with
tlte tlii‘vuIlllllL‘Cl army. The
\t‘IllllICL‘l' system is reportedly ttol
attracting enough personnel “Ilit

technical training or some college
background to tnove ittto the mid-
level and technical positions itt the
Army. .

According to Pacific News. the
Army cttrretttly ltas a serious shor-
tage of persottttel itt such mid-level
jobs as “Aviation Repair
Specialist." “Electrician” and
” funk Mechanic."

Since the old draft was ended in
1972. the tttttnber of blacks itt tlte
Army has increased by 103,000,
while the tttttttbcr of wltites has
dcclitted by approximately 400,000.

F.\cn thottglt 30 percettt of the
Army is ttow tttade up of blacks.
only (LI percettt of the officer corps
is cotttprised of black men.

Pacific News suggests tltat re—
instittttntg tltc dt'al't would enable
the /\Ittt_\ to ittdttct nltitc tuctt with
technical backgrounds and assign
tltetn to tlte higher Ictels of the Ar-
lll_\‘. ‘

It \tottltl reportedly also enable

the Army to continue to enlist
blacks as inl‘atttrynteu and foot
soldiers where they would ettd up
doing most of the front-line
fighting aItd dying if necessary.

According to military sociologist
Charles Moskos of Northwestern
University: “Afghanistan is jttst a
sntokcsereen for the draft. They
don‘t want to admit the problems
they ltave been ltavittg with the
volunteer army."

more than 210,000 personal files on
“known or suspected" pot smokers
In Canada.

The contro'versial‘ ﬁles had been
compiled for more than a decade by
Canada’s Federal Bureau of
Dangerous Drugs.

Drug officials had been ac-
cumulating the files unbeknownst
to Canadian citizens and even to
most government |eaders..The drug
department defended the collection
of personal files on the grounds that
statistics were needed on the
amount and pattern of marijuana‘
arid hashish smoking, in Canada.

According to The Journal of the
Addiction Research Foundation itt
Toronto, some 215,000 of the files
have now been destroyed. Similar
files on the suspected users of drugs
other than pot and bush will con-
tinue to be maintained. the drug
bureau says.
