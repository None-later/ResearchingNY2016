From The

A; Writings,l§|

The human race has grown up. So have God‘s
explanations. Jesus said, 'I have many things
to say unto you but ye cannot hear them
now,“ as a parent would tell a child that there
are things the child will understand better
when the child has grown up. The parable-
based teaching of the New Testament. is
more “grown Lrp' in both content and
teaching style than the simpler cor'r‘rnnnds of
Jehovah in the Old Testament. The Writings
contain the full rational explanation of all the
‘mysteries ot taith.‘ As the teachings; of
Jesus were ‘not to destroy, but to ltrllill'
(Matt. 5:17) thoso ol the Old Ttrrstnrnertt. so
the Writings don't conflict with htrt 'lullill‘
-givo new rnonnint) and insight to - not only
the Bible but the discoveries ol science.

You don‘t have to know or believe the
teachings of the Bible or the Writings to get
to heaven. And yotr don't have to belong to
any Church. Religion is between God and
earth than. itr tree will, But you can't olroonn
SrOtt'tOtlrintr you‘ve never board ol. like
heaven. So God. Who always plays lair, pro-
vides rovnltttion itl)()tll the spiritual reality
man could not discover on his; own.

The Writings don't ask you to take their word
lor it that they are revolution, |l God made
Your mind, truth from Him should make
sense to that mind. All the Writings ask. then.
is that you consider the ideas contained in
them, like a scientist in utloct. to soc it those
ideas make sense.
