Match With Cornell, Syracuse Cancelled

by Larry Kahn

Albany State volleyball fans were
cheated out of an afternoon of ex-
citing volleyball by the weather on
Saturday. The triangle match at
University Gym scheduled against
Cornell and Syracuse was forced to
be cancelled after the Syracuse teatn
bus had a minor accident arid the
Cornell bus was waved off the road
by the state police because of zero
visibility road conditiorts.

“Both coaches called the and we

 

 

mutually agreed to cancel the
match," said Albany State
volleyball coach Ted Earl. “We
didn't want to have a repetition of
the U.S. Boxing team incident." He
added that “the cancellation could
be a blessing irt disguise for us. it
will give us a chance to take a
breather and think about our next
few games." The match against
