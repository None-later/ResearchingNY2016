SUNYA Profs

Gather

To Protest  Draft

by Judie Elsenberg .

.A dozen SUNYA professors at-
tended a meeting Wednesday to
organize a faculty group to join the
anti-draft movement. /

Those faculty members who at-
tended the meeting were'concerncd
about the recent surge oftfiilitaristic
thinking and spending In our coun-
try. according to Professor Bruce
Miroff. Tlte proposed reinstate-
ment of draft registration is only

one indication of the way in which
the government is thinking. he said.
The faculty feels that something
ought to be dottc about this ttow to
prevent anything before it actually
starts. according to Psychology

Professor Carol Waterman.

Tire idea of a faculty group
united against militarism originally
began with students. according to
student Jackie Geib. Members of
the student-run SUNYA Peace Pro-
ject noticed that faculty members
were attcitding their anti-draft
meetings. The students also knew
that matiy of tltelr professors ltad
been active iii the anti-draft move-
ntcttt in tlte I960's. As Gclb, a
nteniber of the student peace pro-
ject, and organizer of this meeting
said. “We (the SUNYA Peace Pro-
ject) were aware that there were
faculty members who had anti-
militaristic feelings. We fell tlterc

was’ﬁ void; the faculty should be
heard along with the students."

As it was discussed among the
professors. it was felt that there
were inlierctit difficulties in having
a combined student-faculty peace
coalition. according to English Pro-
fessor Robert Tltorstcitsen. Thus. a
Faculty Peace Project was created
as an iitdcpcrtdcttt group. althouglu
it will work with the studcttt group
in various activities.

The faculty of SUNYA can make
important contributions to the
peace movement. according to
Waterman. They have expertise in
such fields as the nuclear strategy.
military legislation. and the effects
of war on minorities. Matty pro-
l'cssors were involved iit protests
attd strikes during the l960’s. Some
were draft counselors. wito spoke to
students aabout tlteir options. legal
atrd illegal. concerning the draft.

But more intportantly. all of them
have lived through the era of the
60's aitd have a long term sense of
what went wrong.

As Water'man said. “If we want
to prevent a draft in the future we
must act now. | rementbcr seeing
students in the 60's getting called
for physicals. and others going to
Canada instead of graduate school.
i don't wattt to see that again."

The Faculty Peace Project would
like to be able to edttcate the public
oii the significance of the present
militaristic attitude. One idea which
was suggested at the meeting was
the establishment of“ a speaker's
bureau. which would get various
speakers to come to campus to ice-
ture on the possible effects of
militarism oit ottr lives.

Attotlrcr idea was the formation
of sittall groups of student ' aitd
faculty members which would go to

He is a strong advocate of iri-

Silcn‘s nationalistic involvement

Silcit feels that his dismissal is

Text Of SA Commission’s-Repart‘ On Election

March 16. 1980
Report of [he Special Commission
to Investigale Alleged Election Ir-
regularities and the Subsequent
Cover-up in the Newnturk vs. Wurtl
Run-off Election for S./1. President
' of Spring 1979.

Introduction —-
liilrererrt iii an investigation such
as this is the attempt to be objective
sand tltc tendency to bc subjective.
As many of the principals involved
are personal friends of ours. tltc
urge to bc subjective is great. We
have made cvcry attempt to keep
personal feelings out of out dcci-
siotis. Whut follows is an attempt
oti the pint of this commission to
reconstruct the events us they have
’ been coritmttnicutcd to us. our
recommendations as to what should
be asked of those involved, and our
t‘ecoittniciidutioits us to how best to
prevctit similar events from occurr-
ing iii the futnt‘c.

Ottr findings ——

First and foremost. it is the opiv
nion of this commission litill Lisa
Ncwmurk had no knowledge of the
events surrounding the alleged
cover-up and the alleged ballot box
stuffing before the date of Marclt
IO. I981). A rnitiibcr of people we

' were itt contact with indicated that

they had “heardh or "assumed"
that Ms. Newmark had had
knowledge of these events before
the aforementioned date. Subsc-
qucitl investigation revealed that
Ms. Ncwniark's “knowledge” in
each case was an assumption on so-
meonc’s part. Anyotte who was told
of her "knowledge" iii each case
hitard it from someone who
“assumed” that she knew. We have
no reason to believe that she knew
anytime before Murclt It). I980.

()ttr closest approximation its to
the pertinent events iii iliis story is
as follows:

On the last day of thc run-off
election betwccti Lisa Ncwnuirk iiitd
Shitton Ward at approximately 5:00
p.m.. Jttiiies Mitchell was tip—
[ltl‘ilCilCli by tin upptircntly
delighted Mitchell Davis while at
the liidiuri Quad polling area. Mr.
Davis told Mr. Mitcltcll of how he

had retnovcd 15 Sharon Ward
ballots front the Indian Quad ballot
box and replaced them with 15 Lisa.
Newmark ballots just minutes,
before. After leaving the polling
area Mr. Mitchell told both Craig
Weinstock and Abbie ankins tltc
story that Davis had related to him.
In the course of these conversations
Mark Lafayette also heard the
story. Sometime later that night at a
putty lli' Colonial Qttnd's tower.-
Mr. Lul'uycttc told .lntncs Castro-
Blttnco the same story. Castro-
lilunco ititittediutcly told Ron
It‘rnnk.

Upon seeing how 'quickly tltc
story wits spreading. Mr. Mitchell-
called it inccting itt one of tire rooms
of thc Lilli floor sttitc of Ms.
Ncwmntk. During the course of thc
tiicctittg both Mr. Frank and Mr.
(‘ustro-lilunco expressed uttcnsincss
about keeping the story it sccrct. At
this point it frustrated Craig
Wcinstock thr'nlcncd Iliosc who
wanted to “go public” with the
story with physi'ul violence. Mr.
Mitchell cultncd everyone dowrt and
proceeded to direct the meeting.
Mitch Davis. who lived 25 miles
away. as called and asked to come
to the campus. After continued

discussion it was decided that no ac- ‘

tion would be taken until after the
election results were iii. It was fur—
ther agreed that if the outcome of
the election was affected by_the
alleged ballot switching. the group
would "go public".

Later. the clcctiort results were
received arid Mr. Davis arrived.
Since Ms. Newmnrk won by ap-
proximately 90 votes and the alleg-
ed bnllot stuffing only created a 30
vote differential. the second
meeting became unnecessary.
Sometime during the course of the
evening Mr. Weinstock had
apologized to those he had
tlircntcncd. Each individual involv—
ed \'tts. at least on the surface.
under no threat of violence when he
left that night Jntncs Mitchell.
Cruig \‘v’einstock. Mark Lufttycttc
.lnntcs Custrwlllunco, Abbie
l'luvkins. rind Ron Frank all left
that night uppttrcntly believing that
Mr. Davis had. in fact. switched
ballots.

The recommendations we make
are to Lisa Newmark. We feel that
itt her capacity as the person most
responsible for the proper running
of S.A.‘. site should be the one to
tnakc the final decision on whether
or not to carry out our recommen-
datiotis. Unless Ms. Newmark. itt
ltcr capacity as S.A. President. feels
that it will do unconscionable
damage to S.A.. will recommend
that she risk the following people to
resign:

Craig Wcittstock — S.A.' Co'n-
trollcr and General Council
Member.

.Inmcs Mitchell — Central Coun-
cil member, Internal Affairs Chair
and Director of Academic Coti-
ccrns.

Murk Lafayette — Central Coun-
cil member.

Rationale ——

As part of the group that became
aware of the iricideitl the some day
it happened. these three had it great
opportunity and. indeed. a respon-
sibility to tttnkc it public. The ques—
tiotis of whether or not the ballot
switching really did occur and
whether or not the ballot switching

‘ effected the otttconic of tire clcctinn
are. for all intents and purposes. ir-
relevant. They still had a respon—
sibility to speak to thc clectiott corri-
mission so that they could be the
ones to decide on what to do from
there.

In fairness to tire aforementioned
three. we find no less responsible.
Abbie Havkins. Mitchell Davis.
James Castro-Blanco. and Ron
Frank. As Mr. Havkins aitd Mr.
Davis are no longer at this Universi~
ty. any comment that we could
make about them would be mean-
ingless. Mr. Ctislro—Blarico and Mr.
Frank do not currently hold posi—
tions at S.A.. but we see it as unfair
to the other three if we do not point
out that we bclicw these two ilI'C
just as responsible lot not rcpotting
this to the clcctiort commission. Mr.
(Q'tistt’o-Blnncti tttid Mr. l‘rttnk. us
students an SUNYA. had just us
much responsibility tind tippottuni»
Iy to report this as Mr. Lul'uycttc.
Mr. Wcitisltick. and Mr. Mitchell.
The fact that neither of the two
holds arty S.A. positions tit this
point does not free tltcrti from tltc
responsibility of making the deci—
sion to keep quiet at that point.

Cover-Up

Newmark ask for the resignation of

Michael Levy. Central Council

Chair.
Rationale — .

Even though Mr. Levy found
about this well after it occurred, he
still had the responsibility to have
the incident investigated. As Chair
of' Central Council lie was more
directly responsible to the students
of SUNYA titan anyone else involv-
ed. The third week in July was not
such it prohibitively late time so as
to prevent Mr. Levy from taking
any action.

As to anyone else involved. we
can only say that their futures in
S.A. cart otin be determined by
themselves and by tile voters of
SUNYA. We ask the students of
SUNYA to tttkc a long. hard look at
these people and what they've done
before again voting them ittto posi-
tions ill S.A.

As we feel that the Scnate is more
a Universin position than an S.A.
position. we have deemed it inap-
propriate to recommend any
resignations front that body.

Prevention In the Future —

The elections should be rtin more
strictly. If voting machines are not
available. then a strict procedttrc
for counting ballots before and
after they go to the polling area
should be adopted.

There should be enough schedul-

' ed pollsittcrs and those on standby.

so that no person working for one
of the candidates would have to be
asked to sit at the polls.

S.A. should look into the actions
that should be taken against in-
dividuals involved in a similar situa-
tioti in the future.

This commission would like to
point out that the Allitilty Slttrlclil
Press. which had more information
than we did originally. failed to
share that information with us. This
only made ottr job longer and more
difficult.

Respectfully submitted.
—— Richard Nitgle

—— Pntriciu (inug

— Michael Williamson
— Jeffrey Stein

We would like to add separately
that given the snrttc circumstances.
we aren‘t so sure that we would
lime ttctcd any differently than the
people itiiplicated by this investiga-
tioti. lr‘or tltc most part. those who
knew (or thought they knew) of an
illegal procedure. failed to say
anything because its revelation
would hurt Lisa. They didn’t wish
to see a good friend suffer for
something for site didn't do. Or
they felt that it would hurt S.A.
‘l‘hesc intentions are understandable
and it wasn’t an easy decision either
way. But. unfortunately, these in-
tentions do not protect one’s punish-
ment after the incidence becomes
known.
