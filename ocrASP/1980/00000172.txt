The Editor’ 5. Aspect

. 'I'he - .
Prime
Ingredient

Don’t be deceived by all the corruption and moral
lassitude going around like some malignant epidemic in-
fecting lame organizations like SA. Despite a certain
sense of unease in the air sometimes we do things that
are actually good for something more than beefing Up our
cums so we can get a better job with more money in our
wallets, more lining in our jackets. and more of
everything. Sometimes some of us do thngs whichssmack
of nobleness.

Telethon is a noble affair. it will undoubtedly make a
lot of money for the Wildwood School and the Big
Brother»Sister program. And a splendid time will be had
for one and all.

Other groups exist. just as noble. which try to help
others. People work selflessly in CROP. for instance to
help feed other people who starve due to the neglect of
inhuman governments. Though there are many political
elements in the Anti-Draft and Anti-Nuke movements at
least there are some of us who are really’ trying hard to
elimante threats against our freedom. Telethon willtsuc-
ceed because. traditionallyf it's a blast; and does it matter
if one starves for a cause or if one parties for it. as long as
the cause if helped by the action.

It's easy to sneer at society. and be cynical to people
foolish enough to think that good can be done. It's even
easier to fly a frisbee. pop a beer. or study for a mid-term

 

than it is to loose sleep at night worrying about the draft.
the Nukes. the budget Cuts. starvation, the poor.
ecology. or an election fraud that everybody's willing to
forgive and forget.

Our primary purpose for living is not just to learn. or

eat. or have sex; or work, The prime ingredient

necessary for our survival. not as a nation. or a genera-
tioii. but as a race. as the human race, is our ability to be
concerned. We have to care for each other. this planet.
everything. or we’ll end up alone; alone and cold; and
outside God. the collective spirit of Man. And yes. Spring
is here.

“Are you in ernest? Seize this very minute — What
you can do. or dream ya can. begin it. Boldness has
genius. power. and magic in it. Only engage. and
then the mind grows heated — Begin it. and the
work will be completed!" ‘
