Cover-up of a Cover-up

It is ironic that Home Box Office is showing All the President’s Men
tonight. Perhaps all of our SA president’s men should watch closely.
‘ For Wednesday evening's Central Council meeting proved that
those implicated in the recent SA election cover-up affair are more
concerned with saving their own skins than preserving the integrity of
SUNYA’s elected Student government. And the majority of remaining
council members deemed this as fine.

The fact that high elected officials have admitted to covering up
what they believed to be ballot stuffing in last year‘s presidential elec-
tion is ample reason to call for their resignations. Student trust was
betrayed, the election process was itselfa farce, and an assumed prece-
dent for honesty was replaced with some sick notion of nobility.

Reasons for the cover-up stretched from “the Association’s
credibility in other’s eyes”, to “protecting Lisa from hurt”, to actual-
Iy sparing the joker who allegedly switched the ballots (he had a nice
job awaiting him in an accounting firm). And in the desperate and
highly emotional atmosphere which dominated the meeting, what
should have been the central point of the matter was almost complete-
ly ignored.

A political smokesct‘een was created to put the mechanism by which
the story was told on trial instead of the issue itself. The press was at-
tacked for doing its job.

But the press did not destroy SA’s credibility. SA did.

The meeting was a farce. One got the feeling that they haven’t even
accepted the reality of the situation; their perspective was on such a
distant plane. The Association should never be treated as sortie sort of
corporation, the protection of it an entity in itself, of itself, and for

 

.. editOrial‘

 

itself. They left out morality and discarded the student majority.

(there is onc male). [his past weekend, our
learn \torr first place ill tltc Eastern Regional
Championships. This was an amazing ac-
complishritent for an Albany team, consider-
ing the school's record in Varsity sports as a
whole. We have done better titan any ali-
rrrale team — also winning States and taking
first in all btrl one meet. Yet, itt Tuesday‘s
ASP, we were relegated to a minor position
on the sports page. playing second fiddle to
an all-male volleyball team who /().\'I their last
meet. i am not saying that they are unimpor-
tant. However, i am convinced that oirr learn
httd li lot rrrore to be protrd of than :1 few col-
ttriins in your newspaper. There were, in ad—
dition, no pictures to accompany the article.
I believe tlrtri the ASP wishes to establish ti
policy of equal news tirirc for boili rrierr and
women. However. if the sports editor con»
litittcs to perpetuate the notion that men‘s
sports is rirorc important than women's, the
ASP is back to the old male-female i'olc
stereotyping, l‘lic ('ygrieis deserved the
headline, and we should lime rccciictl it!

Let’s Ali Cut The Fiqhting- Ariel Fight The Cutting

 

The Association complains that the students don’t care, that they
don’t all vote. Can they be blamed now? A fence has been erected bet-
ween the two, an alienation established. This incident will replace the
fence with a wall.

The individuals involved have done much for SA. This cannot be
debated. But they’ve used the power granted them to commit a grave
mistake.

They did what they believed to be a noble deed. When it was
discovered, they could have resigned in honor, remaining in ad-
visory positions in SA. Their credibility would have been restored to
the fullest capacity possible.

integrity should have remained above the individuals, who are all
replaceable.

Too much pain, too much hurt; it has been a week of absolute tor-
merit.

The reply was a censure; a slap on the wrists, since it was viewed
that through the emotional pain, a lesson was learned.

Spring, a time for rejuvenation, cleansing. We hope that the new
election in five weeks will fill the house with a loyal government,
minus the walls.

You see, the only lesson learned was that high level officials can get
away with practically anything.

A cover—up of a cover-up. Two slaps.

Budget, Baby

Now focus on this:

We have grave budget cuts staring at us between both eyes. Hey, no
way. Not with otrr education you don't. Let’s all unite now . . . and
fight . . . fight . . . fight.
