INDIANAPOLIS (AP) Louisville
Coach Denny Crum calls Darrell
Griffith.~the Cardinals' star. “a
true All-American, the best» all-
around guard in the nation."

But Iowa Coach Lute Olson.
whose unranked Hawkeyes will go'
up against the No. 2-rated Car-
dinals Saturday in the semi-finals of
tire NCAA Basketball Champion-
ships. feels just as strongly about
his team‘s back-court ace. Ronnie
Lester.

“When he's 100 percent. Ronnie
is the best guard in America."
Olson declared.

But that‘s the catch —— “when
he's healthy."

How well the Hawkcycs do may
‘hinge on just how healthy Lester is.
The senior and leading scorer in
lo'wtt history. missed l5 gatires this
season because of a knee injury,

says it‘s more like 75 percent.

But even that is remarkable when
yott consider that Lester underwent
knee surgery itt rttid season. n,

"l tltottgltt when Ronnie had
surgery his scztson was in ct." sitttl
Olson. “But he left tlte recovery
room at 4 a.m. and by it) tt.nt. he
was lifting weights with the leg. if
you don't think he wanted to conic
buck. you're mistaken."

\nd now?

"He is a little better each day."
Olson said. "He's still a great
player. bitt he doesn't have that

They can also bring 6-9 seniors Dar-
