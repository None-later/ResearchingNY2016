It seems unfortunate that the
men's indoor track team’s seasott
had to end on a sour note last Satur-
day at R.P.l. The Albany squad
competed in the NY. State Chant-
pionships. but their performances
weren‘t indicative of their
capabilities. They placed 12th
among 22 teams. and only three of
tire 16 runners represerttirtg Albany
gained poitrts. ‘

The team was handicapped even
before the meet began. Albany
entered no weight men sitrce none
of tire Dane weigltt men had
qualified. The team was forced to
l'orfeit all weigltt events since arty
wildcard entry would have easily
beert defeated.

Albatry rtrett’s indoor track coaclt
Bob Mtttrscy wasn't surprised of the
team's subpar performance. “we
had purposely peaked last week."
said Munscy. “The gttys ltad been
ready and Union has a fast track.
We had such a great ttrcct last week
that we were all psyched out."

.lurtior Tony lr‘crrctti added.
“The team wasn't psyched becatrse
R.l’.l.'s track has some sltarp turtrs
which make for a slow track. Also.
R.l’.l.'s sttrface forces you to run itr
flats. while its much easier Id run in
spikes. l‘hc gttys didn't perform
well becatrse they knew they weren't
going to set personal records."

~|~'erretti was orre of the three run-

rrets who scored poittts despite all i

the problcrrts. He won a medal by
capttrrirrg fourth place in the 500
meter dash. His race was spec-
tacular when one considers that he
had to run in the next to fastest
heat. “I jttst ttrissed qualifying for
the fastest heat," said Ferretti. “l
rttiglrt have just finished a notch

higher if i was there."

Ferrctti started slowly as he was
third'out of four runners after the
first 100 meters. Two out of the
other three runners didn’t give him
rnuelt competition, and he was forc-
ed to run against the clock rather
than being pushed by his op-
ponents. He used his efficient corn-
pact stride to propel himself with
the front runner. He just missed
catching him by two-tenths of a se-
cond. “I didn't have enough left itr
rtre. i guess i didn‘t want the lead
bad enough." said Fcrrctti. His
tirrrc of 1:09.] earned him a fourth
place finish ottt of the 33 par-
ticipants iii the 500 meter daslt.

The NY. Stare championships
brought mixed results for Co-
Captaitt liill Mathis. He ran irr both
the 800 arid l500 meter rtttrs.

Mathis started orrt too fast in the
[500 meter race. He ran the first
ltalf itt first place at it super 2:02
clip. “Bill should have rtrrr with the
people rather than with the clock
since R.l’.l. has a slow track," said
Muns'cy.

Mathis simply run otrt of gas. He
lost a posiiion dtrrirtg each succesive
lap after the midway point. Mathis
was passed by all but one of the
rutrncrs in the last lap. His tirrtc of
4:03 is, fine, btrt only a\cragc corr-
sidcring the caliber of the op-
ponents.

Sophomore Scott .Iames ran the
same race in a slower It -at. and beat
Malltis' time by a second. This
secured to get Mittlris' competitive
spirt tip. arrd_,lrc was so anxious to
improve that he scored points iii the
800 rrretcr dash.

Mathis was propelled by George
Lewis of lluffalo State. Steve Red-
ttutn of Colgate arid Steve [Ellis of

Alfred. All these runners including
Mathis~had broked the l:58 barrier
before. Pushed by excellent corn-
petitiort. Mathis finished third with
a time of l:58.6 for the 800 meter
daslt.

The only other runttcr to score
points was Sopltottrorc Bruce
Shapiro itt the 1000 meter dash. "it
was a touglt race. I ran against the
top guys from all over the state and
I was pleased with my perfor-
mance.” Shapiro said. Shapiro‘s
time of 2138.5 gave him a fifth place
finish in the 1000 meter dash.

Albany was lturt by the loss of
their top-notch sprinter Howard
Williams. due to unfortunate in-
jury. Williams was cxpcctcd to take
either second or third iii the 45
meter dash. He proceeded through
the trials without problem. Yet iii
the semifinals, lie “ran into misl'or»
tune." He was in fifth place with
about ten yards to go. Williams
decided to go all oirt and kicked
with all hisstr‘ength. He went into a
leaning position in order to hit the
tape as soon as possible. it scented
as if he were in a four way tie for se-
cond place. Yetjhc had accelerated
so fast that lie was unable to stop.

“i went into a leaning position
and all of a suddctr the wall was
there." said Williams. The l'i\e
yards between thc,tape arid rt wall
cushioned by a tltin rntrr savctl
Williams from serious injury. He
collided with the wall at almost ftrll
speed. Williams immediately fell
motionless to the ground. He was
quickly examined and decrrrcd unfit
to continue.

Despite the disappointing finish.
the overall wort-lost record for the
men’s indoor track team was near
.600.

Crucial Marches Could Spell Playoffs For Spikers

The fate til' tltc Albany State
men's volleyball team will probably
be decided witltitr the next two
weeks as far as a playoff spot is cort-
certted. Tomorrow the team will
meet division arch—rival Rochester
and Nyack College itr Nyack in a
triangle meet. attd then next week
they'll take on Cornell arid
Roche ‘ iii an all-division meet.

“This Is going to be a pivotal
match for its itt the conference,"
said Albatty volleyball coach Ted
liar]. "II we cart come out of this
match 2—0 we have a very good
chance fora playoff spot going ittto
the (.‘orncll/Rochestcr shootout
next week."

As the division stands right now
Albany and Corrtell are on top.
botlt 1-0 with wins against Cor-
tland. Rochester is in third place at
H. splitting their matches with.
Cortland, and Cortland is bringing
up the rear at l-3. Yale was suppos-
ed to be itt the division, but Earl
assumes they are out because they
don’t ltave arty division tnatcltes
scheduled. With the bttlk of divi-

 

 

siott matches still to come the
playoffs are still anybody‘s
brillgatne.

Right now. though. the Dattcs are
looking ahead only to tomorrow’s
match and it slrottltl be a tough one.
Rochester is always a very good
team bttt there is something about
the Albany-Rochester rnatcltup that I
brings out the best in built teams.

 

"Allmny-Rochcstcr matches are
always long. tough matches. We
figltt it otrt point for point all the
way." troted Earl."
Tlte record book ccrtairtly backs
ltitn tip. Last year Albany won both
matches. b they are two wins
they'll never forget. “Both triat—
cites, last year went all five games."
Earl said. "Usually a five game

match takes about an hour and 45

minutes — both of those took two
anti a half hours. Based on the mat-
ches last y ‘ar 1 have to expect a very
tough match.”

Things have changed for both
teams this y'ar. bttt Earl still ex-
pects the usual grueling ttuttclrtrp.
“Roche. ' is a very. very big tcatrt.
They have fotrr players over 6-3,"
lte said. “They already lost a divi-
sion match to Cortland. bttt yotr
cart expect they're going to be up
for tts despite that fact.”

As Earl sees it. there are two
outstanding Roeltcstcr players who
Albany is going to have to slutt
down to win. “Ron Kasi and lvatr
Gill are botlt quality players frorn
arty position on the cottrts. i expect
them to be very. very tough. lvan is
a superlative bullplayer. AA caliber
—— we ltavc to be able to stop hint."

He went on to say that Rochester
is art otttstattding blocking team and
are especially adept if there is a dott-

 

'ble block. "The one weakness we

may be able to exploit is “their
backcourt." said Earl. “but they

’lll'c able to make substitutions to

cottntcr that strategy. Last y-ar.
when we beat them twice. wc ltad a
deeper bench. They were tired out
by the fifth game and we were able
to bring in fresh substitutes. This
year botlt teartts have lost some
depth." ’

As far as Albany's preparations
for the match ltave been goittg. Earl
thinks the team is ready to win after
getting a weekend breather: “The
rest gave us a chance to think a lit-
lie. The team realizes now that it's

-tlteir ntcttlal attitude that‘s impor-
tattt and that if they believe they can
in they'll start winning," he said.
‘lt was otrr mental inconsistencies
that lntrt as earlier. Mentally we
had a few letdowns.“

Physically. the learn is almost
back to top form after suffering
from a string of injuries earlier this
season. l-‘red Askltarrr has almost
completely recovered and is ex-
pccted to play tomorrow. Dcvort
Locklcy is still bothered by shirt
splints, though. and Rich Soeder
has been experiencing some brick
problems attd are tentative for
tomorrow'smatch.

Barring any other injuries the
rearu should be ready. Tuesday they
played an exhibition against Skid-
rnor'e and beat them easily, arid ac-
cording to Earl, “The team had a
great workout Wednesday night
arid they're ready to win. The team

is responding wellttftct' the rest."
