' UUP’Aids SUNY With Ads '

by Rich Kraslow

LTSIen to your radio.

United University Professions
(UUP) is sponsoring comntercials in
an effort to increase enrollment and
sustain a quality ‘cducalion at
SUNY campuses.

“For every irtdividual tltcre is art
affordable alternative...Be part of

tlte teattt tltat makes for a brighter,

future." This is an example of the
advertisements now being broad-
cast in the Albany area.

According to UUP Albany
Chapter President John Reilly,
UUP ltas platts to expand their catn-
paign throughout the state. “Our
target is to reach the most
populated areas." he said.

UUP is a bargaining agent for tlte
17,000 professional etttployecs of
SUNY. according to Reilly.

Reilly said that SHUJKX) is being

   

allocated front UUP uniott dues to
finance the cantpaign which is the
first UUP effort to include broad-
cast media.

The UUP is not satisfied with the
administration’s recrttitntent pro-
cess. “It's our university also. so
why shouldn't we help?" explained
Reilly.

Reilly feels that an active recruit-
ment process ntigltt “encourage
more people to try college attd make
SUNY is available to all."

“With active encouragement,
enrollment of qualified women arid
minorities should increase." ltc ad—
tied.

According to Reilly. the union
has also sponsored a Program for
Adttlt Continued Education
(PACEL The program which is
available at selected unhersilies

opportunity to earn a bachelors
degree. '

Reilly said that UUP has already
received a “satisfactory response"
and expects the comntercial to aid
in increasing enrollntent.

Reilly feels that increased enroll-
ntent will produce a need for posi-
tiorts now being jeopardized by
Governor Hugh Carey's proposed
budget cuts.

Governor Carey has attempted to
justify his proposed budget cuts by
citing a decline itt enrollment
tltrougltoul the etttire university
system.

According to Carey's Deputy
Press Secretary Bill Snyder. the
1980le budget is based on an ex-
pected enrollment of 161,976
students SUNY-wide. This figure is
domt 1.500 from 1979-80 enroll~
ment. l‘lte figure is based on full»

time equivalency (FIE).

Snydel said that the decline in’
enrollment reflects the university’s
problem of dealing with long-term
enrollment. i

Snyder noted that Buffalo State
Stonybrook._ and Brockport cam-
puscs have had “significant pro-
blents" with decreasing
enrollments.

However, a spokesman for
SUNY Central Adminstration
reported an enrollment of 357.473=
full-time and part-time students in
1979. This was an increase of 9.1 12
over the 1978 enrollment ﬁgure.

“it was the largest enrollment
SUNY has ever had." he said.

Central Administration's master
plan based on FTEs predicts an
enrollment of 165,727 for 1980-81.
while Central Adtnittistration is
projecting art enrollment of 163,862
during 1984-85.

Reilly feels the budget cuts are  '

indication that Governor Carey
does not fear public opinion or the
growing Save SUNY campaign.

The AFL-CIO statewide has en-
dorsed the Save/SUNY campaign-
“0rganized labor is the strongest
long range supporter of public
higher education," Reilly said.

According to Reilly, there has
been recent public support for Save,
,SUNY in the legislature.

Reilly said that UUP is working
together with SASU to set up a
public coalition for higher educa-
tion. "We are trying to organize
labor, civic, and religious groups."
he said.

Reilly explained that there is a
certain amount of coordination bet-
ween UUP attd SUNY administra-
tion. “But administration has of-
fered no financial aid," he said.
