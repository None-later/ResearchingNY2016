131:4 Spikers Roll  Two ~ Victories

by Paul Schwartz

The victories weren't especially
surprising to Albany ~volléyball
coach .Ted Earl, but the manner in
which the Danes disposed of their
two opponents on Saturday was not
expected by Albany’s coach.
Traveling to Nyack. Albany took
care of Rochester in just three
games. winning 15-8. lS-l3, 15-3.
and had even less difﬁculty with

the home_team..15-5, l5-5. 15-1.-

“Yes, Pm surprised at the ease
which we did win," said‘Earl. “We
'were never heavily contested -— the
matches, were never seemingly in
doubt."

The victory over Rochester was
crucial for Albany. it was a con-
ference game. and it kept the
Danes’ record in the conference
unblemished at 2-0. and helped
keep pace with Cornell (l-O).
Rochester dropped to 1-2 in con-
ference play.

In their convincittg decision,
Albany stuck with a strategy that
kept Rochester off balance.
Although they are an extremely
large team physically, Rochester
was also a slow team, and the Danes
used that fact to their advantage.
“We were dunking the ball, and us-
ing a lot offspced shots," explained
Earl. “They couldn't cover their
backcourt. And offensively. they

are not a very strong passing team.

Interest Meetings
For
Women’s Teams,

The Albany State Athletic
Department is trying to assess stu-
dent interest and ability in the
following athletic areas: .

1. Women’s bowling

2. Women’s ﬁeld hockey

3. Women's badminton

These three activities placed
highest in a survey of interest.
There will be the following interest

so we served to people ——- We forced
their offensive pattern where we
could key our defense." ‘ .
The gameplan seemed to work to
. perfection, as the Danes rolled over
Rochester in the ﬁrst game, and
continued their dominance in the
second, coasting to a 13-5 lead. But
Albany suddenly let down, and with
Rochester's Ron Kasi serving eight
straight points, Rochester came
back to even the score, 13-l3.

"We got to thirteen, and then all
of a sudden ive decided the game
was over." Earl said. “i guess we
thought we had it won."

After a time out and two side
outs. Albany gained possession,
and “proceeded to put them
away." according to Earl. in the
third game. Rob Harrington went
back to serve with the score
deadlocked at 3-3. Willi Harrington

biggest front line — Gary Becker,
Devon Lockley. and Fred Askhatn
—— and the aligntnent yielded ex-
celletit results for the Danes, as they
reeled off 10 consecutive points,
and soon after defeated Rochester.

Albany will face Rochester again
this season ~— this Saturday. in‘an
important triangular match witlt
Cornell in Rochester. Despite their
decisive victory last Saturday. Earl
insists that Rocltester will be a
challenge when the two teams meet
again.

“i am very reticent to discount
Rochester." said Earl. “They were
playing without two starters — their
best hitter and their best‘setter. it

seems like they’re setting a trap for
us. They are a totally different team
with those two ballplayers. and we
can’t take them lightly. We have to
be on our guard.”

Nyack was another team depleted
because of injuries. as their first
string center did not suit up against
Albany due to an injury. Nyack
also faced the Danes after defeating
Rochester in a grueling four—game
match. and that could have taken
something out of their attack, as

‘ Albany jttmped to an early lead and

Nyack just five points in the first
two games, Albany roared to a 9-0

“The scores were deceiving."

game “where we could not do

Earl.

“It was a good opportunity to

Depth A Problem, But Da'ne Netmen Still SOlid ' '

by Bob Bellaflore

They won the SUNYAC iii the
fall. but two of their top six players
are gone from that team. Depth, or
lack of it. scents to be the biggest
problem for ltead coach Bob Lewis
and the Albany State men's tennis
team as they ctiler the 1980 Spring
season. ‘

Despite losing the fall season‘s
number fotir singles player (Fred
Gabcr) arid number six player Der-
rick Rubin, the Danes still have the
nucleus of the fall squad. Not much
else has changed. and that means
that senior captain Larry Linen and
freshman sensation Barry Levine
are battling neck-antl-ncck for the
number one singles spot, which
chitie claimed iii the fallby virtue
of a challenge match victory over
Linen.

“l think one and two is a definite
toss-up," said Lewis. "Linetl is
playing better than he did lti the
fall.” Lewis made tiole of the fierce
rivalry between tltc two tittd that the
competition for that position goes
beyond them. “l think it‘ll be very
competitive,” commented Lewis.
“Linetl is aiming to get the number
one spot. And you can‘t count out
Lawrence Eichcii (freshman.
number three singles player). He's
been pla ittg well this season, and
he'll haic every opportunity to
challenge for those positions."
Lewis continued. “i wouldn't be
.surpriscd if Linetl plays number
one this spring, although I‘m sure
Levinc will have something to say
about that.“

But the coach cmpltasi/cd the
fact that Eiclicti is not far behind.
“He’s got a lot of tennis ability."
said Liiielt of Eicheti. “On any
given day, one, two, and three are
pretty close."

After them. though. Liticlt ad-
tiiits that there is a drop in talent.
Losing Gaber (undefeated iii the

 

fall) "hurt our depth." according
to Lewis. "We're very strong at
one, two. and three, but four. ﬁve.
and six are wide open," Lewis
revealed.

Vying for those three positions
are freshman Dave Lerner
(SUNYAC champ at number five
last fall), sophomores Randy
Young and Andy Diamond. arid

TOP THREE:

Levine -- “A very steady player.
He's got good ground strokes, but
needs to improve his serve." ‘

Liner! —- “)Steady. His weakness
is his net gatiie. But he's a steady
player and a very intense player.”

Eit-Iren —— “A very aggressive
player. Excellent backhand. He

needs to work on coiisistenc . He

Lauri/[fart] — “They all need con-
sistency to move up." ‘

“if we can solidify the bottom of
our ladder. which is a little chaotic
right now, then it'll‘be a lot more
ordered and we can go into our.
matches confident." said Linelt.

One area that may be of concern.
for Lewis is in doubles. Linett and
Levine arc-a solid to combination

new doubles pairings which. except

‘ doubles matches are crucial in win- '7

ning meets. I I

Also a problem for the Danes will
be the schedules. After the opener
on April 9 against Hartwick, the
netmen must face tomnotch com-
petition in Concordia (a school with
highly regarded scholarship
athletes). West Point and Colgate
are slated for dual-meets with
Albany. and Lewis considers those
two squads among the best'in the
cast. , r

“Based on the strength of our
spring schedule. l ant hopeful that
we cart come out of it with a bettern
than .500 record." said Lewis
(who's never had a losing season as
coach). He continued, “My
philosophy is to get rs tough a
schedule as possible. making better
players, and helping 115 to do better
iti our league play." That includes

. the SUNY Center Tournament with

Buffalo and Binghamton. which
Albany ltas won the last two years.
Linctl considers this season "a
building year" due to the number
of freshman oti the team, but
figures that, as the season pro-
gresscs. they'll get better. “Every
ri‘i‘ttlcli llicy play. they gain ex-
perience." he said. “The freshmen
have come through in the past. i
don't set: why there should be
anything different this spring."
Lewis. who is in his ninth fttll
year of coaclllng'and was sidelined
in the fall by a back operation, is
pleased with the outlook and spirit
of the Danes. "I like the attitude of
the team. They're young. eager.
and cooperative. They're a close
knit group. well spirited, and they
like to play tennis." said Lewis.

are otin hcld iii the fall) was a big

Men’s Track Squad. Hopes To “Battle Some Cages”

by Harold Diamond

Spring might hold some surprises
for the Albany State nicn's track
learn. This year’s tcutn scents to be
better than last years. despite a few
problems. ,

Last year's team won sctcn meets
while only losing two. Al Bennett,
Bob Proulx, .ltillli Little and lid
Von iicvern are gone from that
learn. These four lllltl been the top
point gainers.

Their replacement is \irltrrtlly im-
possible. l-lowcvcr, lllL‘ nucleus of
liill Mathis, Scott James and Bruce
Shapiro should fill the gap. littch of
them is so versatile tlittt Albany
men‘s track coach liob thsey
plans to alternate the three of tlicrii
in the 800. 1500. turd 3000 meter
races.

Albany is in a division with
Frcdonia. Cortland, lirockport.
Plattsburgh. Buffalo, Binghtunton
and Oswego. Albatiy will most like-
ly place lllllLl. behind l’redoniti and
Cortland, l-iowcvcr. Munsr-y feels
“Our team will rattle sonic cages.
We ought to be stronger overall
than last scasoti. Freslnnati Mitchell
Harvard should dominate iii the in-
termediate high hurdles since lie
was quite good in high school.
Seycral men front the football learn
have been recruited for the shot,

Mutiscy said.

One of the problems that faced
the Indoor track team was that all
niccts were on the road. This pro-
blctn continues into the otttdoor
season as only one meet is schedul-
ed at home. This might produce a
lack of fun support which would

iot help tltc team's morale.

It's the hope of the learn that the
location of the RP] meet will be
changed. l‘licir cinder truck usually
is unsuitable for use in early April.
It will probably be too hard due to
the ice.

himself back to health and is ready

James.

The Steeplechase will be
“baptism of fire" for James, a
sophomore. He has never run the
cvetit, yet his first stceplccliase run
will be the first running event of the
first meet.

Munsey thinks James can handle
the tough course. "There are four
hurdles and a water jump which
would scurc most runners,"
Munscy said. “Brit James is
slender. and narrow hipped winch
give him the lightning speed
necessary for this event."

Junior Bill Cordon heads the
jittnping crew along with
Sophomore Titii Gunther. Cordon
is looking forward to the trpcotnrrig
season. “Outdoor surfaces are a lot
better for jumping," said Cordon,
“You can wear spikes arid get a bet-

better environment for training

Iicnctlctto was Albany's second

see four year vctcrltn Rich Heimerlc

ground ball leader for the Danes for
the last two ycurs. and it member of

“Rich is a real solid lacrosse
player." said Moria. “A real solid

will be heading south to North

Carolina for sortie head to head pre-

the state's college lacrosse teams.
