stormed into the national ﬁnals with five straighf victories in the NCAA playoffs. 'l'hosu
wins included ti stunning second-round upset ‘over top-ranked Del’aul.

Freshman flash Rod Foster scored 10 of his learn-leading 16 points in the half to help
the UCLA cause. arid senior forward Kiki Vandeweghe contributed 8 of his 14. The

marked by poor shooting from both sides. UCLA could only manage to hit 33 percent
of its shots in the first lialf while Louisville converted merely 36 percent.

Six points by Foster in a one-minute span late in the first half helped the Bruins break
