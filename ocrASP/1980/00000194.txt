likely say. “the racquetball

It‘s interesting. this racquctl‘rall
cra/c is. Players form litres at 7:30
or' 8:00 a.m. at the main office of
the Physical Education building
just to sign up for a court for the
next day.

People argue ovcr who has a par-
ticular court. or whctltcr' or not

scrrsus was that Perkins had nar-

but Pcrkitts had never mentioned
Albany as one of his possibilitics.
Just last week. Perkins stated his

Auothcr student just fell to his
knees and cried, when posed with
the possibility of never seeing
another racquetball court at
SUNYA.

Most reactions ranged front tear-
ful to dangerously violent. One stu-
dent threatened to deflate cvcry soc-
ccr ball in the Capital Disrrict. while
olltcrﬁ were just baffled at the pur-
pose of such a move.

Due to the fear that the emo-
Iiortal stress would bc too severe on
the players, tltc SUNYA Infirmary.
in cooperation with Middle Earth.
has set up a racquetball arid squash
withdrawal clinic that will deal with
the psychological problems that
may arise. It will begin operation

In view of thc gmcrnor's proiios-
cd budch cuts. many of those op-
posed to the soccer arcna feel that
the ncccssrtry funds won't be
available to complclc the job. Gary
Schalsky. chairman of the Athletic

Finance Comrttittcc. says that will
be no problem.

“We‘ve begun construction of a
10 foot, clcclric‘dl fence around
botlt llrc skating rirtk arid tltc foot-
ball ficld. Thctt wc'll be able to
charge admission to both of those.”
said Schatsky. “That most likely
will cover a substantial portion of
tire cost . . . that is. if sornconc will
go to thc gantcs. That'll also teach
tltosc chcap bastards who try to
break down the fence every year.“
he concluded.
