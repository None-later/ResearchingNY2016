in a startling series of events.
Albany State Athletic Director
Robert Ford accepted the resigna-
tion of six prominent members of
the Athletic Department and. ttren
promptly added his name to the list
of disgruntled coaches.

Along with Ford. who doubles as
Albany's football eoaclt. basketball
coach Dick Saucrs, Bill Schieffelin
(soccer). Bob Munscy (cross coun»
try). Rich Skeet (baseba _ ‘
Motta (lacrosse), and swrmming
coach Ron White all resigned their
posts yesterday. leavittg tlte athletic
department itt a state of cltaos.

Reached \vltilc clearrirtg ottt his
office, Ford commented on the
mass quittings: “An atltlctic depart-
mettt can do otte of two tirittgs.
Either it can gradually becottte
stronger and grow attd corttirttrc to
improve. or it cart regress and
weaken as the season wears on. l
guess ours did the latter."

A spokesperson for Albany
women's athletic staff isstrcd tltis
statement to the press: “Of course
no female coaches quit. With Title
lX right around tlte corner. it would
be stupid for any of us to get out."

in separate interviews held yester-
day. each coacit expressed personal
reasons for their actions.

Schieffelin cited his team's lack
of facilities as a major reason for
his leaving. The soccer team’s prac~
tice field ltas recently been
transformed into a skating ritrk.
leaving the booters little space and
Schieffelin little patience.

“We just don't get the respect we
deserve." said Schieffelin. “First
they make us put some Americans
on the team. and then they turn our
field into a skating rittk. We never
even seen anyone use that silly little
ice patch. it just doesn’t do anyone
any good. We can’t practice there.
and think of the people who live on
lndian Quad. They ltave to walk all
the way around it when they get off
a bus at the gym.” ‘

Facility problems also brought to
an end the long tenure of Munscy,
who seemed puzzled over a move
that he considered a trivial matter.
His cross country squad currently
runs a course which leads around
the gym, parallel to the lake. arid
back around Perimeter Road.
Munsey’s plan was to shorten what
he called a “torturous run" by hav—
ing his charges run over a newly-

constructed bridge over the campus
lake. Btrt this plan was shelved
when the university administration

refused funds for the construction.

“l'd like to see sortie of those
thrce-picce-suited adntihistration
boys rtrrt ottr course.” snarled
Munsey. “They'd be huffing and
puffittg artd ltoldittg their sides
before they even got to the lake. My
runners have been complaining to
me. Just the other day one of my
freshmen came up to tire arid said.
Tree. Coach. itow do they expect us
to run so far'.’ After all. we’re only
cross country runners.‘ The kid’s
rigltt. I’ve been at this school for a
long tirtre. arid our first priority
should be that bridge."

Ted Earl: His coaching has ltlttt
next Albany A.l).

After guiding his tcath to one of
their most successful seasons itt his
25 year career. the walkout of
Saners came as tt'surprisc to those
close to the basketball program.
But a stttllCL' inside the Albany
basketball entourage told the ASP
that Satrcts was deeply trotthlcd
after thc Danes lost a 63~62 decision
to a weak Orreonta team during this
past season. The source stated that.
Sauers would repeat the words
"there's no place I hate worse than
Onconta. there's no place I hate
worse tltatt Oneonta" over and over
again. Satters denied this claim.
“There are a lot of places i irate
worse than Otteonta." he said. "i
hate Danville. Kentucky mrrclt nrorc .-
thatt i hate Oneonta.”

Sttucrs also seemed pertttrbcd
over a promise that lnts not been
kept. "After rtty 400th win, the guy
said something about rc-natning the
University (iym. i thought i heard
something about ’Saucrs i’avilion‘
mentioned. Now its rtot really any
of thy business. bttt it doesn‘t sound
like that bad of an idea."

Another frustrated coach is
White. whose swimming team will
be hard—pressed for space itt Univer-
sin l’ool itr the coming months.
llccatrse of the sudden ice skating
booth (due largely to the recent
Winter Olympics) the administra-
tion has seen the need for art indoor
facility irr addition to the outdoor
rink. The only available spot?
White‘s tirtte arid space iii the pool.

“First they force tire to ptrt some
foreigners on the team. arid then
tltcy turn otrr pool ittto art indoor
skating rink." exclaimed White. “I
don't think i'vc even sccrt one
damn pcrsort on the outdoor rink.
so why do we need another one?"

White's complaint did trot fall on
deaf cars. A member of the ad-

ministration (who wishcd to remain
anonymous) issued this statement:
rink cart exist together. Tire water
will only freele on the surface, so

though."

The increasingly tigltt athletic
budget forced Motta's resignation.
According to Mona. the budget did
not allocate enough funds for
recruiting of lacrosse prospects.
thus forcing the coach to foot thuclt
of the bill himself. Although he did
not wish to be quoted, Motta cited
rtutttcrotrs Thruway toll costs as be-
ing too tttuclr of a financial btrrdcn.
The coach also noted that because
he had to budget his gas, he could
not reach the far corners of Long

top quality lacrosse players reside.

waiting for him, and i could use the
help. He could work with the out-
fielders."

Ford's sltocking resignation will
perhaps be the tttost damaging blow
to Albany’s athletic department. A
workaholic. Ford frequently com»
menth on the extreme pleasure he
derives from the constant pressures
and turmoil associated witlt the
position of athletic director. and
gave spccial notice to his work on
tile athletic budget. a task l~’ord
tcrtttcd “enjoyable.”

But it seems that the timing: “its
right for i-‘ortl‘s exit. lie stressed the
need to quit immediately. and cited
his football ttpcornrrry

A bit of staff j 'alottsy also \ttccd-
ed up l’ord's decision. [Earlier in the
year. ottc of Ford's colleagues (he
did not specify) was turned into a
hero after lrc coacltcd his tcaht to
his 400th win. and Ford feels that
his coaching accomplishments have

not been as widely publiciled. On
October 20. Fold reached a
milestone with the Danes 56-0
swarnping of Brooklyn College. it
was Ford‘s 601lr coaching victory at
Albany.

“i didn‘t see anyone name that
weekend ‘Robcrt l-‘ord
Weekend.‘ ” cottrrtretttcd Ford.

Ford also was upset over rumors
that the administration planned to
use sections of the football field as
art alternate outdoor ice skating
rink.

There are rto definite
replacements lined up for the seven
vacated positions. htrt the most
established spot appears to be the
basketball coaching slot. witcrc
Sauers' job will tttost likely be fill-
ed by current teattt manager Biff
Fischer. Already ottt scouting.
Fischer could not be reached for
cortrrtrertt.

The atltlctic director situation is a
