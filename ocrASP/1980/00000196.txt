As the New York State

state budget. over 500 students and
faculty gathered on SUNYA's
podium Wednesday. March 26, to
protest proposed SUNY budget
cuts.

The rally was part of a statewide
SASU sponsored sludcttl strike

in the venture included Binghatnv

Iowrirds SUNY, demonstrators zit,
SUNYA carried signs Fading

“Carey has rocks in his head —
Geo. dept. on strike" and “No
Machiavellian approach to educa-

Students were especially outraged
at Governor Carey's proposal to cut
$27 million front SUNY, in light ol'
the fact that a $249 rnilliott surplus
has been foundinva York State‘s
budget, according to SASU Presi-
dent Sharon Ward. As it was
reported iii the March l3th edition
of the Titties-Union. the legislanire
