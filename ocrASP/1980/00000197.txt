have on the elimination ofaeatletnic
departments.
‘ According to SUNYA Afro-
American Professor Frank Rogue,
cutbacks would mean scaling down
the Afro-American program in
tnost SUNY schools and
eliminating it completely frotn
SUNY at Cortland. More impor-
tantly, he stated. budget cuts itt this
department would tneatt the
dismissal of more titan one half of
all the black teaching personnel in
the SUNY system.

This rally wasn’t the first attetnpt
to show tltc students‘ and fttettltys‘

opposition to further budget cuts.
according' to NY State
Assemblyman Mark Seigal. These
two groups have been lobbying,
petitioning. and writing letters since
January. said Seigal: He feels that
this show of unity will give the
legislature power to defeat “the
governor and his crowd.” Seigal.
who is the Higher Education Corn-
ntittee Chair. predicted that “we
will have substantial restoration
over and above the Governor's
budget lltis year."

The faculty have shown their
dedication to the SUNY system

in a teach-in following the rally, |
SUNYA faculty focused on the
basic facts surrounding the budget
cuts and offered their assessment of
the situation.

History professor Larry Whittner
pointed out the inequities in Carey's
budget appropriationsLHe criticiz-
ed Carcy's aid to private schools
wltilc state schools were suffering.

The total amount ofcuts itt aid to

public ltigher education in this state

is equal to the amount ofadditional
aid being given to private schools
Whittner said. New York State
already gives tnore money to private
colleges than all the other states
combined, he added. Whittner also
pointed ottt that the governor ltas
approved the construction of a new
gym at Syracuse University. to be
financed through state funds.
Meanwhile, it is rumored that tltc
trustees on the board of SUNY :tre
eotntcntphtting the elimination of
one or more SUNY campuses due
to luck of funds.

l‘tte trustees on the botntl ol'
SUNY are the ones who decide
ottich departments and settler-s

go through. At'cotding to I-tu:|i\lt

SUNYA.

“Jr’s up to us to see that SUNY’s
budget isn't cut up any further,"
Taylor added. ' '

Whittner said there was a social
class dimension to the future of the
SUNY system.

Wealthy peﬁple are opposed to
public education because their
children don’t use it and they pay a
larger share of the cost of these in-
stitutiotts through their taxes, ac-
cording to Whittner. “They don't
care about public facilities and they
are deciding what should be cut."
he stated. v

Whittner compared the SUNY
system with the situation of the
state university systems in the
midwest. l‘heir budgets aren't cut,
he stated. because gradttates of the
state universities there have become
powerful itt the legislature and
don't allow bttdgct cuts to he made.
()nr problem. Whittner feels, is that
SUNY is a relatively new system
which doesn't have as many
graduates out .uttl, consequently.
