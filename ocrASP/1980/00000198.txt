Bus Drivers Speak Out:

continued front page four

0. Do drivers ever skip runs for no
reason?

A. Day drivers do their job.

i know for a fact that we have a
couple of drivers who work as ex-
tras. They are ttot very conscien-
tious about their job. Occassionally
they just skip a run. It's Itot very
hard to do; they just turn down a
street, turn off the lights, and sit
there for a while. Of course. when
that happens it upsets the witole ap-
ple cart. Pick a night when the
Wellittgton buses are runnittg real
heavy. What have you got? A lot of
trouble. You pull up at the stop.
attd 200 kids are going to get on a 71
passettgcr bus. That’s illegal.

Q. Do you feel the garage is run
well?

A. Yott aren’t going to use tny
name? .

Q. You don't wish to be identified?
A. l Would like to wotk here. i
would say the garage is run poorly.
l work at tlte school in tltc summer
and l kttow wltat happens to (the
buses). They sit itt the garage all
suntntet. i drive the buses; i know
“not shape they‘re lll. Notltittg hap-
petts itt ttte suttmter. Nothing, that's
the problem. Obviously you can't
fix a piece of equipment “he” it's

going up and down the road. right?
So when do you fix ’em?

This last summer only one bus
out of Five passed inspection. That
shows you what i mean. i have
worked for other bus companies
before. and.'l tell you. this place
just doesn’t take care of its equip-
tneltt. ll just isn't safe.

Another driver expressed dif-
ferent views._

A. The garage is terrific. Those
guys work their hearts out. Tltey are
doing a hell of a job. working short-
handed.

Q. How do yott explain bus 32?
A. “'5 up to the driver to turtt the
malfunctions into the garage.

0. The driver said he turned it in
regularly for two months.

A. Well...

0. Did you ever report a malfunc-
tion of your bus to the garage attd
Itot have any response?

A. Yes. All tttose noises you keep
hearing is tttc transmission itt the
bus getting ready to fall apart.

Bus 37 has been teported many
titttcs. ll ttas got a wry loose from
end, and transmission trouble.

Bus 47 has a front end that jumps
all over the toad mm 35 tttph.

it's going to fall apart.

0. i understand that a few years
ago CDTA (Capital District Transit
Authority) submitted a plan to take
over the SUNYA bus system. Do
you have any comment on that
idea?

A. We get along witlt CDTA like oil
and water. CDTA would love to
have the SUNYA ccutraet, and put
SUNYA out of the bus business.
They offered us a buttt deal — a
schedule cut to a fraction of what it
is now, limited night service. and no
compromises. They were also going
to change the Itutnbcr of stops, attd
would be far more strict.

They get away with murder,
those CDTA buses. They go around
with broken glass, bald tires. and
busted springs. CDTA also hates
students. Haven't you ever taken a
CDTA bits? Once they get (the con-
tract with SUNYA) they will do
what they want with you. You will
lose your personalized service. if a
bus ran with only 5-6 kids on it they
would pull that bus right off the
run.

0. l have heatd that the SUNYA
bus service \\ as ottce a lot more e.\-
tettsive. Do you know anything
about that?

A. There was once shuttle setvice
around tlte circle. a hits every 5
minutes. They stopped it durittg the
Oil Embargo of 1973, attd heyet
Iettetsed it. They used to use the
