Teen Terror

A study of some 2000 retired

senior citizens has found. that at’
least one fifth of them are .so afraid '
of teenagers that they deliberately ,
remain indoors after 3:00 p.m.,
when most high schoolslet out.
' The study was conducted in Pitt-
sburgh, Philadelphia. Boston,
Baltimore, Newark, and several
other cities by Geoffrey Godbey. a
professor of Recreation aftd Parks
at Pennsylvania State University.

Ciodhey said that about two
thirds of the 2000 elderly persons
studied said the fear of critnc, par-
ticularly al lite hands of teenagers.
also kept tltettt away from senior.
citizens' centers. parks, and other
places they would normally go.

And 88 pereettt admitted they
were so afraid of teenagers that they
crossed tlte street or changed direc-
tion just to avoid young people.

Mid-Week Crisis
’-

 
 
 

A scholar of calcttdars and
holidays claims tltat every mid-week
holiday costs Americans about $l3
billion in lost production.

Wallace Barlow says he has been
studying tlte itttpact of holidays for
the past iii years. He says that
holidays itt tlte middle of the week
result in a 40 percent deelitte in pro-
duction. Holidays falling on Mott-
days, he claitns, account for only a
l7 percent decline itt output.

Barlow is now lobbying Congress
to adopt his otvn calendar — a
calendar which divides the year irtto
12 months oi‘2ti days, with holidays
ranging lll length from one to six
days at the end of each 28-day
montlt. The Barlow Calendar, in-
eidentttlly. creates 2i new holidays,
providing, 52 percent more leisure
time, while allegedly still increasing
U.S. productivity.
