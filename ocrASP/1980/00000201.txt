Old Story

We were late lunching with Humphrey Bogart the other day at
Romanoff‘s. downing buck seventy-five bourbons and telling the old

played in the parlor downstairs. “Mister, I met a man once," they
always begin, and they end with a wow finish.

Of all the gin Joints in Hollywood we walked Into this one. Across
the way Montgomery Clit'i was giving Ginger Rogers bugle lessons
while Fred Astaire eVer gracefully tapped his foot to the soundtrack
from Star Wars, and subtly winked at Cyd Charrtse doing the tango
with Gene Kelly. Jimmy Cagney and Cary Grant walked in with two
blonde bombshells: a sweet kid called Marilyn Monroe, and the
heavily bandaged Janet Leigh.

Bogie had a blast telling the one about Spencer Tracy and Katie
Hepburn in London. We had all heard it before. “You know i don't
think Spence ever won an Oscar," Bogie said, "He won two,"
replied David Niven, Bogie sneered. We focused our attention on
the comical sight of Orson Welles. Alfred Hitchcock, Charles
Laughton. Sidney Greenstreei. and Liz Taylor. Orson brought a
deck of magic cards but Johnny Carson got him drunk on cheap
California wine before it was too late.

They say everything's cheap in California. Maybe. Hollywood's a
two-bit town hill of million dollar babies and dime-a—dozen pretty
boys. But to us moviefolk. it's our home town. and though it
cheapens and degrades us, we're too busy living out our twenty foot
silver screen fantasies to chuck it all for the circus or the Great White
Way or a house in the country. As Cecile B. DeMille would say,
“That's Show Biz." Judy Garland might say it too.

“You oughta be in pictures," said Ronald Coleman to a young girl
who turned out to be either Bette Midler or Barbra Streisand. And
Groucho got a kick out of that.

The hours wore on and lunch turned into supper. At the table Ber-
nard Hermann and Dimitri Tiomkin compared notes. Martin Sheer.
and James Dean compared profiles. and Paul Newman and Robert
Redford compared smiles. Faye Dunaway got sick on Walter Mat-
thau's cumberbund. Jack Lemmon laughed. Doris Day left in a huff.

Marlon Brando and Roler DeNiro argued about the Method with

Errol Flynn and John Barrymore to no conclusion. Bette Davis got
soused and tried to stuff Joan Crawford into the chopped liver
skyline of New York City, but the Fondas and Jimmy Stewart broke
it up. Tallulah Bankhead and Mariette Dietrich discussed Garbo in a
dark corner and Dustin Hoffman asked them for an autograph. He
got Gloria Swanson's instead. ‘
In the early morning of a late night we left the fast emptying bar.
Bogie had a six am, wake up call and he wanted to get home before,
it would wake Bette Bacall. Clark Gable offered to drive us home but‘
he snuck off with Vivien Leigh much to Laurence Olivier's dismay.
Finally we decided to walk through the dark, barren streets of New
Babylon, whistling to the stars. After all. we thought as the sun slowly
climbed up out of the valley and the first wave of silver limousines
sped towards the studios, tomorrow is another day.
