This is an issue tltat is very close to all of us;
we all have elderly relatives. neighbors.

responsibility not only to irrrprove tlte quality
of life for our community's inhabitants. htrt
we have an equal responsibility to save lives.

Asking questions is only a small part of tltc

Reform, a community organization concern-

Underlying Meanings

To the Editor:

In response to the recent column iii the
ASI’ cntitlcd “Are Equal Rights Really
Equal'l". Nancy Dunlop appeared to me to
show a deep misunderstanding. and conse-
qncntly extremely inaccurate presentation. of
what feminism and the Women's Movement
on campus represents.

Ms. (Miss?) Dunlop exposed many
commonly-held misconceptions possiny cir-
culating on campus as to what being a
fcnrirtisr menus. To begin with, regardless of
thc frth that she appears to negate the use of
languugc (tcrming it part of an overall
“l'r'ivolity” to rrrakc a “commotion over
semantics"), radical feminists are concerned
with the undcrlyirrg meanings of language
and Irow and why thcy perpetuate the oppres—
sion of all women. A parallel bctwccrr sexism
and racism, relevant to make the point here,
is tlrc incontcstablc fact that it is offensive to
refer to a young llluck man as a boy. wtrcrcns
many young worrrcrr on campus still rcfcr to
themselves and each other as girls. Just as
people who are Illuck arc oppressed by white-
dominated society. women are oppressed by
tunic-dominated society. Language rcflccts
ideology.

This facctiously condescending articlc
represents a woman pillcd against other
women. in a style which is thc same as the
one used by society to place women in corn—
petition with each otbcr for powerful rnctt.
Feminists do rtot want to become men, nor
do they wartt to corupctc with each otltcr for
men of arty standing. But rather, feminists
are trying to fight for sclf—dcterminutiorr in
their owtr ways, seeking otrt solutions to our
oppression as identified by women who have
all gone through common cxpcricnccs itr this
society.

Feminists have struggled with concepts of
fcrrrirritrity all their lives and dccidcd that Ilrc
standards of tire ways it worncrt should be arc
not dctcrrtrirrcd by worrrcrr tlrcmsclvcs. but
rutth by trrcrr. This is obvious cvctr in rela—
tiorr to the styles of clothing gctrct'nlly vicwcd
as “l‘crnirrirrc” why Irrrvc wontctr trruli-
tionully worn uncomfortable gurtncrrts,
\vltcrcrrs rncn's clrrlltittt', has permitted tlrcnr
their basic lrccdotu of rnorcmcrrt‘.’

'l'Ircrc is nothing wrong. in rrtv opinion,
with worncn and men looking dill't'n-nt rlrrnr

For the Students

To the Editor:

After rcflcctirtg upon tltc S.A. covcr«Up for
the past‘ few weeks, I can be silent no urorc.
The whole issue lrrts conl'irntcd what has been
my belief for quite sottrc lirttc, artd that is that
SA is more concerned with ilscll’ than with
the student body as a whole. Let me explain.

Just consider tltc very reason for the cover-
up. Those who dccidcd to cover-up tlrc aIIcg-
cd ballot-stuffing did so to protect the newly
clcctcd regime. Even though the students had
a rigltt to know c,\act|y what had happened,
it was decided by scvcrnl members of SA to
protect tltc orgarti/ttliorr rather than to irr-
forrtr tltc students. In otltcr words. the
prevailing philosophy rurrorrg many members
of SA sccms to be that protection of SA
has priority over protection of the student
body. This is really quite absurd. since the
mcmhcrs of SA are elected by tltc students
to serve the sttrdcnts.

l gtrcss the real ptohlcrtr with our str.dcnt
govcrmncnl is that SA has bccorrrc sort of a
political club. The club nrcmbcrs sccnr to
have bccomc wrapped up irt themselves and
detached to a certain dcgrcc from everyone
else. They |i\c by tltcir own set of rules and
morals. As a personal friend of scvcrrtl
members of thc sttttlL‘IIl gorcrrnucnt, I see
that SA has bccontc rtrorc than a vcry im~
portaltt part of their lites; some of rtty ll icntls
arc obsessed with SA. And from ttrcir corr-
vcrsrttions. I cart scc that ttrcir obsession is
not with helping other students. but rather
they are ohscsscd wittr the workings of SA,
with fcclirrgs of powcr. and with bureaucracy
irr gctrcral. l'lrcy thcmsclvcs arc to some c.\-‘
tcrtt simply :rrntrtcur burcttuctrus practicing
for the real world. I‘m not saying that tttcsc
l‘ricnds of rrrirrc ntc c\i| pcoplc. In frth I’m
not sure they rculr/c what they sound ltkc. If
they would just stop tllltl lislcn to tltL'tttsclvcs
maybe ttrcy would see that ttrcy arc ittdccd
turning irtto politicians. ttrnt ttrcir locus of
corrccru hos ttt.trcd inward, away from tltc
students. And maybe if I'ntnrc SA members
continually rc-cvaluutc their roles as studcrrt
t'cpt‘csctllttlir‘cs. rrrrd try to fight off Iltat
dcsirc to become budding bureaucrats.
mawa there will be no nrorc scandals.

—— Alrtrt Waldman

On May 5th, the students. faculty, and administrators who comprise the Universi-
ty Senate will meet for the last time this semester. A main focus of this meeting will
be a proposal frortr SA to extend student representation on the body to four years, as
opposed to the two year trial periods which have dominated most of the 1970's.
(Before then, there were no students on the Senate.) _ '

SA's request is valid and commendable. During the last two-year slot. the involve-
ment of student senators has resulted iii a wide assortment of constructive input and ‘
change. The large, interested number of student reps who have attended each '.
meeting have tackled major issues such as the quality of campus life, alcohol ‘
policies, health service. residence cortcerns. grievances, pass-fail and plus-minus
grading. add-drop, honors requirements. tenure, advisement, teaching evaluations.
guns for security, and the infamous “W”, just to rrarrtc a few.

They've learned that itr order to ntake legitimate changes in a system. one must
work within its framework. 'l‘lrcse past few years have reflected this.

We have one ol‘ the largest potential organized student voices in university gover-
Itancc iii the State of Ncw York. Much more needs to be tapped.

Especially in these dire times of cutbacks and decreased funding. the union of stu-
dent. faculty. and administrative minds in the decision-making process is vital.

Sincc univcrsity policies so directly affect studcrtts' everyday lives here at
SUNYA. it is essential that they continue to have a Icading voice in them. Student
seats foster direct student input into these processes. They add creative attd diverse
altcrnativcs which help to makc decisions more lcgitittratc for all thosc involved.

We strongly urge the faculty and tulminisrrariou of the Senate to recognize the i
nccd to keep students on the body atrd cstcnd this representation for the next four r
years.

In the cod, we all want what is best for SUNYA and togctlrcr we cart all work Irard
toward it brighter tomorrow.

In Rotten Taste

Wltilc wc arc usually proponents of free speech and press and the rights of all per- ‘
sorts to cspr'css ttrcir values and opinions. tltcrc comes it tittrc when one simply must
slam thc hammer down. .
Just before our Easter artd Passover break. a newspaper by tltc rtamc of WASP
sprcad its deplorable fibers across thc face of this cleatr campus.
Wltilc we do not objch to an alternative press, quite the contrary. we felt that this
WASP wars simply an ovcrly-scnsational, prejudiced, malicious. artd iII-lrumorcd
crcatiou. t
if this is it sign of wian the new dccadc will bring us. ttrcir orrc can fear that some 1,
students have not lcarncd a thing.
April Fools. my cyc!
