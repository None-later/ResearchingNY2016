Lastly. in quarter-ﬁnal aetion,

the Big Sticks edged the Egglanders
by a final score of 5-4. The Eg-
glanders had nabbed the ﬁnal
playoff position by virtue of a win
in their last regular season game
against the A'wesomes, who were
captained by Scott commer.
Against the Big Sticks, however.
Rob Weiss’ and Keith Shricber’s
two goals each were not enough to
win this time; the Big Sticks put in
five goals with Vlado Sergovich and
Chuck Kt'eindlcr having two goals
and Andrew Marrin scoring one.
With all quarter-final action
completed. the Big Sticks and
Pierce Silencers faced off in the
’semi-finals. It was not until
Sergovich scored in double over-
titlle that the Sticks walked off with
their 5-4 victory. The other semi-
final thatch between Cosmic Debris
attd Uncle John's Band is slated for
this weekend as well as all remain-
