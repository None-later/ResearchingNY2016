The AMlA and WiRA basketball
league champions were crowned
this weék as the playoffs resumed
after last week's recess. With the ex-
ception of league Ill, whose games
have been postponed until the SA
Supreme Court rules on the TED —
Dirty Nelly protest, the playoffs in
leagues ii. 1V and the the Woman's
division wound down to the finals
with the Eggs, Go For it and the
Asubettes capturing their respective
titles.

also brisk as the Danes scrirnmaged
against several North Carolina
teams. including North Carolina
and Duke. '

“The trip definitely brought the
team together," noted Moira.
“Being able to just concentrate on
lacrosse made qtrite a difference."

Moria hopes that the difference
cart sustain itself. The Danes face a
mediocre Potsdam team this Satur-
day away. htit with a ticw coach arid
some promising new personnel.
over-confidence might very well be
just what Potsdam is looking for to
spark them.

Difficult or easy. as Coach Moira
said. “The Danes need this wih.
We're H. and we‘ve got a big game
corrting tip against Cortland next
Tuesday. We need this win."

Potsdam is also the first
SUNYAC game of the season. arid
a victory there would bracc them
for the Cortland conference game.
Cortland, of cottrse. is just about
the toughest team the Duties have to
face. and that's when they'll go tip
against former teammate Dave
Benedetto. who recently transferred
there.

Season Home Opener Today vs. LeMoyne

by Marian Weisenfeld

If the enthusiasm could
guarantee a winning .scasori. their
the Albany State women's softball
team would surely itavc a cliahcc at
clinching first place in the Nationals
this year. lint since enthusiasm isri‘t
tltc only key to victory. Albany
softball coach Lcc Rlictiisli has pirt
together a squad with lots of talent
as well. “We |ra\e two tnain things
going for us this season . .. the
students are more talented. and that
means they are ritorc c\pei'icnr.'cd.
more dedicated. and they have a
greater knowledge of the game."
Rhcitish said. “Secondly. w - are
working like much rhore of a learn
‘this y'tir as opposed to rtiric itt-
dividuuls playing hill on the field."

This season marks Rlicnisli's lltlt
season as softball coach at Albany.

She has previously coached
women's basketball. field hockey,
attd .l.V. tennis. Although Ritchish
doesn‘t like dwelling on past
seasons. but last year's campaign
was pretty good for the women
ficldcis. They ended with a record
of five wins and eight losses.

Returning players include
sopiioiiroi‘cs Deirdre l’al/atto.
Susan Schulihan. and present team
captain Kathleen Cui'atolo.
(‘ui'aiolo concurred with thcitisii's
high hopes for Iltc 19th) team: “On
lltt: whole. wc tune a lot of game L‘.\-
pcricitcc behind us so pcoplc know
ulnrt they arc doing. . .idou‘l like
to be embarrassed otri there, so i
rrrirrk we're going to be in every
grime right down to tire wire." Witii
the three returning players from last

year's squad along with the wealth
of new talent the team has acquired.
it should be a great deal of exciting
softball this Spring.

The woiiicti’s softball team opens
their season today against area rival
LcMoync at 3:00 at Albany’s home
field hetririd Dutch Quad. This year
Albany is also hostng the Division
tit Softball Championships which
will be held on May second and
third. The trust school automatical-
ly gets a bid in the competition. but
Ritchiin hopes to have a “good
ctiotigli record to qualify without
tiic guaranteed IioSl's bid."

When asked what we cart expect
froth this season's women's softball
learn. Rhenish stated that the squad
will be “enthusiastic. aggressive.
and will take pride in litcir perfor-
inancc."

Tables Turned In Albany-Cornell Match-U p

by Bob ilellttflore

it sccrhs as'ifthe tables have turn-
ed this year for the Albany State
men’s volleyball team.

Last seasott Cornell was oti trip of
their division —- the division tiicy
share with the Dancs and three
other teams". And Albany was sc-
cond. chasing the ivy Lcagucrs all
tltc way to a tic-breaker that would
decide who would represent tttc
division iti tiic qualifying round of
the NCAA Division ill castcrn
rcgiotials. Cornell eliminated the
Danes their.

lint now Albany is 4-0 iii tiic divi—
sion (l4-5 overall) and must face
Cornell (4—l iii division play) and an
out—of-tlie-running Cortland tcarii
tomorrow afternoon at University
(iym starting at 1:00 p.tit.

“We caught them last year.” said

Albany volleyball head coach I‘cd
litirl. “Now. Ilic situation is rcvcrs—
ctl. We're ill from and they've got
to catch us."

The spikcrs are in this situation
by virtue of their 3-0 sweep of that
saritc ('orricli squad on March 2‘) by
scores of lh-H. l5-9. and l5-7.

“They were ckccllertt wins for
us." commented liai‘l. noting that
tile match had gotten off to an
“interesting start."

l‘hc Daitcs jumped to a 7-0 ad
vantage, but at that point. Cornell
called time out. came back. and
retaliated with seven unanswered
points of their own. forcing Albany
to request a tiriic out.

As the two teams were “slugging
it out, point for point" according to
iiari. (‘oritell took a l4-i2 lead.

next four points to take lltc game.

in the second and third games.
the early-goings were men. but i-‘arl
noted that Albany would get “two
or three" points to tticir otic. and
just pull away.

A coriibinatioh of superb Dunc
dcfciisive blocking and fine hitting
from the outside proved too much
for Corircil who. according to liatl.
had a poor day offensively.

Albany also riict Rochester in
that meet, after ilic ('orrrcll thatch.
Earl cited that the spikcrs had a
rotigli time coming off the euro»

tually gasc Rochester a lZ-Il lead.
and then decided we were going to
play volleyball." ‘I‘hc Danes came

the Danes took it i5-l(). Albany was

Looking to tomorrow's iiizitclics.

mean anything if we don't do it
again."

“Toughest Schedule Ever”F or Women Netiers

by Eric (irulier

“This is oirr toughest schctihlc
cvcr." commented head coach
l’cggy Mann about the Albany
State women’s tennis team's rip-
coming spring slate of opponents.
which coiilaiiis six dual matches
and one invitational.

“iii the fall. We play tiic local
schools. but none of tltcrti have spre
irtg teams. We had to look out of
th‘ area for teams that worild t'iVL'
its good matches." continued
Mtllili.

“()ur strongest opponent will lie
Vassar." stated Mann. H‘i‘licy are
always very strong." liut she also
feels that St. .loliri's University will
Itl'ovc difficult. “St. John's is a
Division l team with a lot of good.
scholarship player's."

Albany’s first opponent will be
llirtghamton. “They are always
tough. They and Albany are the two
best tcarirs lll tttc SUNYAC." Mann
claihrctl.

Concordia. West Point. and l.lU
is how she rates the talent of the re»
riiaiiiing tlircc Icarus on the
schedule. Marin is quick to point
out that “none of these icarris are
bad or are to be corisidcrcd easy."
She went on to point out, “The
matches you think (“1‘ cats)‘. you
lose."

New to tire schedule this season is
the Seven Sisters invitational ‘i'oiir~
Irarpcru at Smith college. "this is
llls‘ first year the torri'iiaiiicril is an
llIVlllllltiiiiil, lllltl Albany in one of
llte two state learns that have been
invited." civplttiitcd the coach.

Prepared to inch this difficult
sclicdulc is tttc largest tcrini Marin
has itad in but 17 years as Albany‘s
coach. “i had ll people try out for
the team. and I had to cut four."
stated Marin. l-.igtit freshriicti are
members ol tttc squad.

As lot her top four
players (the only ones wiro have
definite spots) Marin sees it this
way:

1. Lisa l)ciicnrii:uk:
raitkcd in tire top It) oi collegiate
players in tlic state. She is' an c\-
really strong. but

sirtglcs

“Lisa is

ccllcrit captain ~
licr backhand is a little weak."

2. Arrric Newman: “Anne is a
rcal fighter. She likes to win. She
might not look as strong as some of
tltc other piaycis. Iitrt slic always
coriics through."

3. Nancy light: “Nancy has
ticvct played for Albany Iicfoic, litil
since March slic's improved great-
ly." I
4. Karen ()‘(‘oiirici: “Kurctr is
riot hack to top forrri from last war.
birt she will itll|titt\c."

Mario is first to point oitl that
“one good player does not always
win a match. Doubles ricvct' tcts
enough attention. Inn they are tltc
ones that will matches."

"A good siiiplcs playcr‘ docs not
make zi good doubles player." con-
llliiiL'tl Mann. “A good dotiiiics
player has to yo to the llL'l‘. ‘l‘Itey
must always know \vltcic their part-
her is on the court." Mmui corr-
clinlcd by pointing oiil that “it good
rloulilcs player can have a weak
serve and be slower on the court

than a singles player."

Albany‘s two dotiblcs teams will
ire tirade up of new combinations.
l-‘irsl doubles will consist of senior
Susan iiard aiid ficsliliiltti Chris
Rodgers. The other team will lie the
duo oi Amy l’ciniierg and IiIl\L'
Solomon.

With ninc players. lltc
Mattti can hope to use iii a iiialcii.
she feels sonic cottch It for tire other
team members. those that won't
always get to play. “i lrcy crit .l.V.
three years ago. but i have L'tltilltlll
interest for a iicw .l.V. learn."
Mann continued. “l'vc told the
girls that they don‘t hate to go to all
matches. but they all want to. The
only real court tiriie they willch is

tlitisl

iii practice."

Wltilc the learn has iiol had its
much practice as Marni would have
liked (due to tlic \vctitltct'). sltc fccis
tltc \votk—oiils "have been \cry
hard."

“We started practicing March i.
My assistant. Marylin liolib. has
run the girls through heavy condi-
tioning." explained Marni. “We
had them (the learn) doing a lot of
running. rope jumping. and
working-out with the Nautilus. This
is by far the best conditioned tcam
I've ever had."

Mann will sec just Iiow ready the
team is tiniioir'ow when they open
their season at liingliariitorr. Last
fall. Albany lost to Iliciii l-(i.
“iiihgiiamton is our greatest rival,
but we always play tlicrii first. In
the fall. wc'rc ricvcr fttlly l' ‘ady, but
this spring. we've had more than

enough time.’ coriiiiicrilctl Mario.

"in |‘)7tl-79. wc lost in tire fail
and won iii lliL' spring. i would like
to do that again. it will litiild otit'
cirttrrrsiasrir."

The possible loss of Dericmiiark
to illness for tomorrow‘s mtttch
clicits Mann's concern. and she
hopes not to be forced to play
without her.

Although an trtid ttcd season

would be nice. Marni thinks “that
airii may be too high. i would like to
tio well ill Seven Sisters (the invita—
tioritil) so we could go to tltc AIAW
(Association for lhtcrcolicgiatc
Athletics for Women) tournaihcrit
in May."

The one thing Mann would really
likc to do is “keep cvcrybtidy hap—
py. interested. and iriiprovc their
s ills ii tennis."
