it took tlte Mets eight years to
win an opener. but Mike Motta did
it iii three. The feisty coach of the
Albany State lacrosse teatn led his
team to art encouraging ll-9 victory
against local rival R.l.'l‘. last Satur-
day, giving the Danes that H)
begirirting needed to spark the team
to their best season in years.

, The spark died down just a little
bit on Wednesday, when the Danes
gave up a close one to R.P.l., 10-9,
bttt it never died dowrt all together
as the Danes came froth way behind
after a slow, cumbersome first half
to give R.P.l. a real run for its
money ill-half riuriiber two. coming
back frotii a 7-] roiitpirig to the l0-9
close call.

Actually, one cart say that the
Danes played one and a tialf games
of liery, hot lacrosse. titili/ing tlte
team effort that will have to hold
them together, relying on that
young dcfertsc ttiat looked so well lit

game of cold, uninspired lacrosse,
being out-hustled, and spending 90
percettt of tire titiic on dcfettse.
Well, that one tutlf of poor lacrosse
gave the teaiir its first loss, driving
the poirtt home tltat the confidence

by a vacatioti of solid playing in the

As the rain fell lightly but steadi-
ly, it became obvioris tltat the
Albany State baseball team's opcri-
ing garlic of tire spring — a
doubleheader with Hartwick — was
not going to be played on Wednes-
day. But sitting in his t‘lfiec,
baseball coach Rick Skecl was not
thinking of the rain, but rather the
cltances of his young Dane sqrrnd.

6-0 set.

Motta realizes this, and he too
sees a correlation betWeen the loss
Wednesday arid a loss of energy on
the part of the learn irt general.

“i just don't think we were ready
to play on Wednesday.” said Mot-
ta. “We were out-hustled on the
ground ball, arid we had trouble
clearing the ball. We were playing
too ntuch defense iti that first half.
and the scored showed it. We just
couldn’t generate any offense."

However, when the team settled
down and relaxed, got itself
together, and started playiitg with
the attitude that Motta couldn't
help btit notice on Saturday, the
changes were ohviorrs.

“it took us tltrcc periods to get
going, to settle down," Motta
observed, “then we started chipp-
ing away. We were way behind, btit
we didn't give ttp."

Over and o\cr, Skccl stressed his

ingredient for a successful season.

An estimated two hundred gays

According to a spokesman for
Albany's (lay ('oriurittrrity ('ctitcr.
ttic purpose of tiic rally was to
“uplift the spirit of rttc gay and lcs»
biiiri rights moycincirt. gain public
recognition and attention, and dc-
titaiid changes in laws concerning
ctiild custody and gay youths.“

l‘ivc statewide gay and lesbian

rally was part of a weekend long

Art Moppctt of tire Gay Youth of

“Youths have a tigtit to develop
their sexuality at arty age," said
Moppctt. ”The age ofconscrit laws

Music. anti-war speakers attd
rninie highlighted the Festival for
Peace, a culturally-oriented
demonstration for peace at Page
Hall, Suitday.

Speakers irieiuded feminist,
black, and socialist viewpoints. but
centered around art anti-war, auti-
dral't, pro-peace theme.

Mike Kotak. a Vietnam War
veternn presently working with the
Albany Peace Coalition (APC),
sponsors of the festival, spoke with
certainty of the government's effort
to get tire U.S. involved in another
war.

“The government is trying to
whip tip war hysteria." lte said,
“and it‘s really bad. They don't
even have a country picked otit yet.
l‘uey do have a shopping list to
choose from, thoriin -
Afghanistan, Russia, Iran..."

arms race and producing three to
ten bombs every day.” Brammer
said. “there are many good reasons
to actively work for peace.”

According to Brammer, the
Coalition is seeking to oppose all
U.S. moves towards war. to non-
violeutly unite all opponents of
war. to promote the search for
peaceful alternatives to interna-
tiottal conflicts, and to carry our
education programs and counseling
to implement these purposes

The festival also featured juggl-
ing. mime, and music, ranging from
the ja/I and rock grotrp Jasmine to
John Roman and Friends. which
played Latin and Carribean
rtunrbers.

Musician Nelly Brown played

“They don‘t want tts to worry

The purpose of ttie festival, t ‘~
cording to llr'amnier, was to raise
funds arid raise consciousness
regarding the draft and other issues.
