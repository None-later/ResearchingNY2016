A Maryland legislator says it's
not easy being fat. and he‘s doing
something to lighten the load.

Raymond Dypski, who dropped
his weight frorii 370 pounds last
year to a present 260 pounds. says
fat [people have to pay double for
clothes they doti’l even like, are
plied with worthless diet plans, and
have trouble gettittg jobs.

A state study commissioned last
year at Dypski's urging foutid
evidence to support his colitctitiolls.
The study found discrimination
against overweight people itt
employment, education and ti varie-
ty of consumer areas. ranging from
the cost of clothes and life iti-
sttrancc prctiiiitiiis to advertising for
unproven reduction programs.

The Maryland study said the
weight-loss industry. with an
estimated annual gross of SIS
billiott should be required to adver-
tise its success, failure. or attrition
rates. Currently. a person without
special training catt operate as n
weight-loss expert without any
guarantee that his or her procedure
is safe or effective.

Dypski is currently drafting a hill

to make discrimination against
overweight people illegal. He will
also seek to regulate the weight-
redueing-aid industry.

A survey compiled by the Union

Made In t '
Heaven

Two members of a rock and roll
group called “Rock atid Roll
Heaven" were tnarried last week in
Norfolk, Virginia in an unusual
wedding garb: both of'tlieiii were
wrapped iti wltite bandages l'roln
neck to hairline. '

The group's specialty is look-
alikes of rock stars, dead attd alive.
The couple had undergone surgery
to change their appearance. The
bride. Erin Rhytic. had surgery to
make her look like Linda Rotistadt.
Iicr grootti. Dainty O’Day. was
reconstructed to resemble Kenny
Rogers.

O'Dtiy l‘ortncd "Rock and Roll
Ileavcn" iti I970. Three other
members of the grotip have already
had plastic surgery to look like
three Itilc greats: [Elvis Presley. lhld-
dy Holly and .lim Croce.

Says Rliyile about her new looks:
“i don‘t know what Linda
Rottslttdl's reaction “ill be. bttt I'm

that: Elem;

' sure she'll havepnc."

 

Women with high IQs who work
and are single are happier than high
IQ women who are married
liomemakcrs, according to
Psychology Today magazine.

The' magazine reports that Stan-
ford University psychologist Robert
Scars — currently in charge of an
ongoing study of childhood
geniuses —- has found that the
liigltest occupational “satisfaction
of any group of women in the study
was among those who worked and
had no children and no husband."

Pauline Sears. also a Stanford
psychologist who shares respon-
sibility for the Study with her hus-
band, said, “Altilost without excep-
lioti the hotneniakers at age 62 said
they Would like to have worked ex-
cepl when raising their children. . .
even though Ilic stereotype they
grew tip with was probably that
every woman should want a good
marriage l'ot‘ctnost."
