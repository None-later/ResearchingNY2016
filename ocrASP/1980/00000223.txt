Stickmen Breeze Past Potsdam With 12-3 Rout

 

, Need ‘100 Plus Percent’
Against Cortland Today

 

 

by Jay Glasen

Mike Mrrtta knew that they need-
cd this victory. Tire r-atn kttew i
too. It' Potsdam didn't know it.
they certainly found out on Satur-
day afterrroon.- when the Albany
State lacrosse squad put a solid
learn et't'ort togcttter to gairt their se-
cond rictory itr three attempts. a
healthy I2-5 routing at Potsdam.
leading the Danes irtto today‘s corr-
I‘rontatiort against SUNYAC giant
Cortland with their best season yet
to date.

the Danes hare been playittg
good. respectable lacrosse. trttd
Saturday's victory was a perfect e\-
ample of that vital combination of a
strong. impenetrable defense. rt
lirely midfield and a balanced at-
tack. a cotnbinatiott that will not
only have to remain. bttt improve.
as ttre Danes enter phase two of
their season. when they'll face four
straight gatttes ol‘ the toughest coili-
petition they'll have this year.

Satisfied with the victory. conch
Motttt rtnd no particular complaints
about the team’s pert'orrrrartce. btrt
secs ttrc need for more than 100 per-
cent irt the coming games.

“l’otsdtttn is not it real strong
team." he observed. "and we did
pretty well. but we weren't rr\'Cl"
tun-luring. We played a balanced
gatne. brrt we've still got to im-
prrne."

Most ol‘trrttt improvement will be
needed offensively. Motta is
generally nappy with his young and
experienced defense. but sees some

weak spots on the attack.

"\\'e'\e got to irtrpr'ote the
ground balls.“ he noted. “it llllt'l rrs
against RH and it was weak on
Saturday. the than up still needs
irnptoterhent too. artd we were ortlt
one for four on Saturday." I

Ol'l’errsiteiy. \etcratr Rictt
Hcithcrle was ttre shying grace. wirrr
l2 ground balls. at goal. and four

was Mike Sloctun. witrr two goals

()n defense. liilly Watson played

Last week. Cortland rotnped

looking to do away with these

as mrtcrr as possible.
