 Housing Crunch is EXpected

 

 

More students, Not Enough Rooms

by Patricia nmnley ~

The long litres sttrdents are cott-
fronting during stage otte of the
housing process is only a beginning
sign of the cotnittg year’s housing
crunch.

Director of Residences John Wel-
ty has predicted that 3600 to 3700
continuing students will sign up for
on-catttptts housing for next
semester.

“This year rrty greatest uncertain-
ty about making 555a projection is
ttrc cl'l'ccl of tire incrcasc itt tltc rcnt
ol' stttdcnt aparlmcnts. " Wclty
said. “Wc have taken tltis ittto cott-
sidcration and expect an increase itt
those applying for nit-campus hous—
itrg."

“In the past six ycat‘s wc ltavc
had a large amount of students ap-
plying l'or run-campus housing ,
ttran we cotrld accomodatc. Tltis
year \vc c\pcct tltc satire," he said.

Continuing students have first
priority to oil-campus housing until
April 25. After that the empty
spaces are given to newly admittcd
students and transfers based on

when their housing contracts have
been received," said Welty.

“Like any other institution. we
admit more students titan we iravc
housing for," said SUNYA Presi~
dent Vincent O‘Lcary.

O'Leary said. "It would be
wrong not to admit these students
because after the first few \vccks \I'
school tltcrc are cxrra bcds dttc to
students who drop ottl or do not
return."

I “Ol' cottrse tttis is an incovc-
nience to stttdertls during this titnc
with tripling atrd tlrc hat't‘aclt stylc
quarters \vc are forced to set up.
lint this is not a pcrmancni condi-
tiott and it is bettcr titan being
denied housing." ltc said.

O‘Lcat‘y said. “We also admit
students who must find their own
housing. This is the same in all
institutions. Time is not enough
housing but that does ttot mean tltc
sttrcnt s‘hottdi be detticd admis-
sion."

“In an attctnpt to provide nrorc
on-campns housing. SUNYA ap-

plied for a loan from ttrc Dcpart- ,

ments of Housing and Um],
Developetnctrt. l‘ltis rcqu “3i
