The Bosses Talk

Bus company problertts with ag-

rrci cattttot always be solved on tltc
garage level. Large questions of
tttottey allocatiott and policy are the
dortraitr of the plant department ad-
ministrator's. Plant Superintendent
lt'a Dcvoe attd Plant Director Detr-
rris Stevens. Although the bus corn-
party is ortly a fractiott of the plant
department. the company's corn-
plexity attd importance make it a
prime focus of concern for these
tWo ttrert.

lra Devoc talked abotrt some pro»
blettrs. but i wottld say service is
very adequate. We ltave problems.

we are itr good shape.

Dcvoc went on to explain int-
ptovcutcnts the departttterrt has
planned. “This year we are very

tight, as we are a man ttrtd tr half

provement. This year we are bttyirrg

“Students like to rvait for the last

the bus over titirty itr the city
anyway. We have got sotne com-
plainch and sotte tron-contplrtiners.
Tire day that driver complained. the
night driver did not lodge a com-
plaint. Some people complain their
coffce's cold'in a restaurant. We
elrartge tires frequently, so the tire
that was on the bus (left front)
rttiglrt have been scheduled to cottte
off. All brrscs are inspected. you
know.

Q. How do you insure that the
buses are running on schedule?

A. i sit ottt itr the circle sometimes
at trigltt. with a sheet of names and
titttcs to check with. We trad a little
personnel problem a while ago. otte
driver kept leaving early. That is
taken care of. Leaving early is a lot
worse than leaving late. We have
about twenty-five drivers. When
you ltave that many people together
yort are going to have problems. It
is rrty trope sortie day to get a clock
—— a great big clock -— set up at the
circle. l‘htrl should stop some

serve the students. There was talk
of sweetening the deal with a free
bus pass for limited service. We had
negotiations for a year and a half,
and explore the thing fairly and
completely. The main problem was
that it was nut responsive enough ——
not a dedicated service. This matter
is not dead yet. We just broke off
negotiations because we felt it
would not serve the students' in-
tercsts.

Although the buses are inspected
occasionally itt the circle and on
the road to insure they are on
schedule, some drivers believe this
is not as effective as it could be. The .
inspectors always use official
vehicles, which "can be seen a mile
away." Tire inspectors also don’t
ttttrke a habit of checking froth the
Wellington stop. wircre buses are
trotoriorts for leaving early.

Director rtf the Physical Plant
Dennis Stevens is a man with ntuclr
responsibility. He emphasized the
importance of tire university bus
system.

“ The bus system is an academic
support service. as rtruclt as the
computer center arid the library.
When one reviews and corn-
tetnplates changes itt that service.
it's necessary to keep ttte impor-
Iatrcc of this service irt tnittd."

/\n itttct \icw \rith Stevens reveal-
ctl the following:

Q. What is your opinion of bits scr-
\icc at this sctrool'.’

A. It is good scrv cc. given the dens
\ll)‘ of tire usage of the system. arid
the support available to run it. As
slllrlt‘ltls shift from Ilse of their owtt
priralc within. it places it higher
demand on the bus system. Given
escalating Crisis and the trend

tional demands for next year. Cort-

would say he lllli arr cyccllettt

as .t thoch [or other schools.

t). lion do you think the budget
t'llls trill affect the bus service?

A. I cannot say right now. ;l\ we
don‘t know ltrt\\ the cuts trill affect
Ihrs school. lIrctc are a scrics ol'

Q. What is your opirtiott of tire bus
strpct\isor. Mr. (inthch'!

A. Bill (ttrtlten docs art cyccllcnt job
of managing the system irr the

ty percent. iiill and the staff under

However. both drivers atrd students
see several situations irt rtecd of im-
