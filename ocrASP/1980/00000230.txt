Great Spirit. 0 Mighty Force, grant to us the deca-power that we
might clasp the knowledge of the world in our outstretched hands.
Beloved Wonderkind. allow the sight of heaven to penetrate our
ever gazing eyes so that they find the perfect ten.
Heart of all Hearts. send down to this too fragile earth the
untenable secrets the winds carry away. Let the valley spark with in-
spiration and tenness,
0 Grand Majesty. partake of our tenacious spirit that withstands
decadent decay for the tenants of tender decisions.
0 Heart. 0 Soul. absorb us into thy multiple, the base of all
luturekind. Creator. combine our fractions. add the decimals of our
components. subtract our most tenuous tendencies. divide our ten-
sion with tenderizer. and multiply with infinite tenure.
0 Most Tenable. make .us a ten.

Woe to us survivors living in a world that idolizes perfection. We
must always be doomed to waxy build-up around the wings. The
higher our great expectations take us. the further we must fall when
our wings melt. it's the price paid for flying too close to the sun.
Sure Bo flies high, Farrah flew high. but how long can one remain
airborne. pray tell? Vinnie the Squid thinks Bo's a beaul. a perfect

can avoid chaos by stomping on it with the loot (size ill) of
