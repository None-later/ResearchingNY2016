be arriving on the wonderful isle of Long. My
younger sister answered-the phone. Alter the
usual sister like comment ("What do you
want?", “My English teacher's a pain!"). she
got down to serious business.

"We gotta get Mom something for Easter."
she said in an urgent tone.

"What are you wonied about?" l replied.
“Why don't we do what we normally do: wake
up belore she does on Easter morning. get in
the car. frantically look lor roadside llower
dealers, sign the card on the way home and go
back to sleep."

"That's so old hat." Sis retorted "Besides l
happen to know Mom is sick of getting [towers
on Easter."

"Sick ol gcttrug llowers'.’ ("morn leiriali's

"I can't believe you cart go to college and be
