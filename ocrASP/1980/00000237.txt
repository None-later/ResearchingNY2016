"We were tltorougltly humiliatcd
last Saturday against Bittghamtott,
and | tltougltt we would have to
show character to come right
back," said Skeel. “And we did
come back. We did a tticc job.“

Doing more than a nice job were
Mike Esposito and Jim Bittker, two
junior lturlers who completely
thwarted any Hartwick scoring op-
portunities. Esposito brewed
through the Warrior lineup. allow-
ing a mere two hits. three walks.
and chalking up nine Strikeouts in
the opener. Bittker was only sliglttly
less effective following his team-
matc, posting a slnttout tttttil the
seventh ittttittg. handling Hztrtwick
on three ttits and fch bases on bulls.
and equalling Esnosito by fanning
nine Warriors.

“That's what we should be do-
ing." stutcd Skccl. “Everything we
did \vorkcd. our substitutes produc-
ed, and we punched runners across.
And ottr buttery did it beautiful
job."

 

After three scoreless innings in
the ttlghtcap. the Danes erupted for
four runs in the fourth inning. pro-
viding Bittker with more than he
needed. Arcario started Albany off
with a single. and the Danes then
pounded Hartwiek —— five cott-
secutive hits. three of which were
for extra bases. Rhodes doubled.
Moscltella singled. Cardillo tripled,
attd Fiorito doubled. In the sixth.
Albany padded tltcir lead. as Ar-
cnrio‘s double brought across twu

at Unlon on Wednesday, taklng‘a

4-0 lead in the second inning. With
Albany on top 8-3, Union staged a
tnild rally, scoring three runs in the
ninth inning.

Albany next hosts powerful Le-
Moyne in a doubleheader tomor-
row, and after the Danes' com-
eback victory yesterday. a win
Clabeaux called “super.” and
Rowlahds termed “a conﬁdence
builder." Albany is certainly enter-
ing the touglt twittbill in high
spirits. Perhaps they'll even add
another team meeting in
somewhere.
