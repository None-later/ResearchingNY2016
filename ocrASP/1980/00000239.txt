Is A 20-8 Setback Respectable' For Stiekrnen?

by Jay Glssen

For Albany State." it was a matter
of respect. Playing the number two
ranked Division II lacrosse team in
tltc tiation was ttot to be a \‘iclot‘y
situation, but a “hold your own"
situation, or iii the words of Albany
lacrosse coach Mike Motta. an at-
tempt to simply “be respectable."

l'hc final score was 20-8 and as
expected. lltt: Danes were on tile
losing end when the clock ticked
donn on 'l‘uesday afternoon at tltc
field lies! to University Gym. and
Cortland handed Albany their se-
cond loss in four games. evening
their record at 2-2.

Was the icant respectable? Did
they achieve that level of confidence
to give Ctll'llulltl a fair ruti for its
money? Well, a little yes and a lot
no. The best way to describe Tucs-
day's game for Albany was uneven.
After a slinky, sloppy opening
quattci. followed by little improve-
tttettt III the next quarter. the Ditties
finally began to settle dowu lll lllc
second half when they picked tip
tlteit tctiipo and evened tltitigs ottt
just a little bit.

“We started ottl real slow," said
tittaekntan Warren Wrey. who
came tlp witli two big, goals III the
second half. “We Were a little Ilt.‘l—
volts going against the number two
ranked leattt atid we made tiiistuk'es.
In the first half we let it get away
from us, bill it] the second ltalf he
got back some of the respect we
wete looking for."

Indeed. the first half was a bit of
a circus. Within ten seconds of the
opening faceol‘f. Cortland scored
their first goal, a quickly sctvup
score lltat sltowed right away tltc
lettni speed that Motla simply called
“incredible.” A minute or .so later
they scored again.

Most of tlte subsequent faccol'l's
wctil Cortland's way. and Albany

Albany's season ended on a sour
note. but as a whole it has to be one
ol the tnost posili\ c sttt‘ptiscs of the
yeah. "It has been a good yeat for

It was ill the third period that

tackman Wrey began to spark the
attack with his two goals. getting

who came through with the other
two.

“Warren (Wrey) looked real
good iii that third period." said
Motta. “Offensively, he was our
best player. Nobody was outstati-
ding in the midﬁeld. We started
hustling for the groundballs. but no
one was really outstanding."

Defensiver it was also not one of
the best efforts but hustlers Toni
Scarpinato and Bill Watson did the
best they could against a team that
was setting up shots sometimes
befoic the Danes could set up a
defense. (‘ioalie Ken ‘I'irinttit did. as
Motlti said, “lite best he could."

penetrating the defense, titetc was
little lie cottld do to stop titetti.

Said seitiot‘ Rich lleittierlc. usual-
ly a key scorci for tile Danes wtto

knowing the odds and still doing the
best they could. a matter ol Inning
but still \yiitititig tcspcct.

Motta thinks his squad came
,close to it, the L'oitlatid coaches
thought they did it. But wtietttei
they got the tespcct they wanted oi
not. a little tnote than 'l'ttesd:ty'sel'-
