The palatial SUNY Plan In downtown Alban .

 

    

The legislature hopes to restore school funds.

Restoring Cuts Is Big
Task For Legislature

 

SUNY Is At Stake

ALBANY (AP) With old wounds
still festering and new battle lines
being drawn. it looks like it will be a
while before the Legislature decides
how much of the money Governor
l-lugh Carey vetoed frotrt tltc new
state budget can be put back into it.

Legislators outlined plans Morr-
day for restoring some of tire
disputed money. bttl indicated that
there are still uncertainties about
rust hou muclt restoration can be
ifforded.

\t stake are funds for everything
tom the State University to various
local aid programs. as well as
'Itrcalcncd layoffs of state workers.

The Senate last week failed to
override Carey's vetoes of sortie
$215 million in such items out of tltc
Sl4.I billion budget. Carey had
promised to discuss restoring at
least some of those items once the

veto fight was beltind him.
however. and tltat is what the new
talks are focused on.

The remaining budgct talks are
also being corrtplicatcd by the rein-
troduction of relatively dormattt
budget ideas. such as lav cuts and

\nd there were suggestions that
the vetoed spending item tttosl
strongly pined after by New York
Mayor Edward Koch — a SII7
million chunk of revenue-sharing
aid. of which about $70 million
would go to his city —— was in
langcr of moving to the bottont of

verybody's list of priorities. Tltc

rcasott sccrtted to be Koch's
vociferous efforts on beltalf of it.

AMI/I And Supreme Court Dispute

continued from front page

While studying in the library Sun-
day afternoon. March 23. Supreme
Court Justice Brad Rothbaum was

approached by members of Dirty,

Nellie's All-Star basketball team.
Unhappy with the Council’s deci-
sion and their loss in the second
game. they asked that Rothbaum
have the court reinstate Dinkelman
and order the game replayed again.
Rothbaum said he‘d see what he
could do.

The following day. after ntecting
with DeMartini and lntramurals
Director Dennis Elkin. Rothbaum
issued a 48-hour injunction on fur-
ther Division III basketball games.
putting the playoffs on hold until
AMIA reconsidered their decision
on DeMartini's original decision.

Meeting that Thursday to discuss
the issue. the Council remained
firm and decided not to reconsider
their redccision of DcMartini‘s
decision.

This goes on.

‘0.

With the Easter vacation rtear.
both AMIA and the Supreme Court
agreed to postpone any action trntil
Wednesday. March I‘). At a
meeting that nigltt. Rotltbanrtt and
fellow Justice Leander llardaway
ordered AMIA to reinstate
Dinkclntan and to contirnrc tltc
playoffs.

No games have been played since
that order. artd AMIA is seckirtg art
appeal of the court's decision.

.0.

"There must be instituted art ob-
jective criteria for judging the
eligibility of varsity athletes." This
is llrad Rothbaum‘s ratiortalc for
tltc Supreme Court's decision. He
says students all pay their ta\ and

should have an equal share in stu-
dent activities. By the court's deci-
sion. he’d like to see AMIA create
standards by which a player can be
judged. “Factors including playing
time and possible injuries must be
taken into account. and each player
must be judged on the same basis."

A factor that played a role in the
court’s decision was the play of
Cartnelo Verdajo, a now ineligible
varisty player who played on a Divi-
sion lll team 2 years ago. 6’4” Ver-
dajo led last year‘s varisty squad in
scoring. and has played for the
team during the last 4 years. The
year he played for the intramural
team he had taken a break from the
varsity. His team won the AMIA
championship.

“Verdajo's was a case of so-
meone not playing varsity who
wished to be on a tcant with his
friends." says DeMartini. "Of
course we ltavc to cottsidcr how ef-
fective someone will be on a team.
but we also have to consider tltc
wishes of an individual." DeMar-
tini says he recognizes the need for
consistent rulings. but that he
believes each decision is one ntade
on an individual attd should be
treated individually. “Each council
year by year has its own personality.
They try to do what's best for tltc
persort arid tltc league. Though not
always consistent. there's nothing
arbitrary about their decisions."

u.
Dennis lilkin is right when he says.
"There's more to this question tltcrt
\tltelher John Dinkelman should
play or not.“ for one thing. tltc
Supreme Court decision asserted
tlteir right to review SA group con—
stitutions. Tltal which scents like a

side effect could have the mm. [MI

Financial Aid Endangered

eontr’nuedfram front page
ment. . .. ,

The ﬁnancial aid package for the
next five years has passed through
the House and faces Senate ﬂoor
debate.

According to Snook. the Senate
Education sub-committee recently
chopped away at House proposals
lowering figures on all ﬁnancial aid
allocations.

The Senate version entails tltc
following:

BEOG half cost limitation will be
raised to 60 percent. a to percent
reduction of the House proposal.

SEOG alltoments wil peak at
$440 million.

According to Snook. college loan
‘trograrrts are establishing a new

centralized student loan program to
deal with the situation. The Na-
'tional Direct Student Loan Associa-
tion. (NDSL) will borrow money to
give to campuses repealing student
borrowing from individual banks.

Despite the lending arrangements
made. interest rates for NDSL will.
rise from 3 to 7 percent and from 7
to 9 percent for Guaranteed Stu-
dent Loans.

According to SASU represen-
tative Bruce Cronin. “they are still
talking in Congress and the Senate
should come to a decision within
the week." Cronin added that
SASU arid other student groups are
lobbying extensively against any
major cttts in the financial aid
package.
