LeMoyne’s Power Was Too MuchrBatmon Swe t

by Paul Schwartz /

On Saturday, the Albany State
baseball team hosted a LeMoyne
club which was undefeated in 11
games so far this spring. Late in the
afternoon. it was up to 13 straight.
as LcMoync put on a hitting display
that more than matched the Danes'
first game output and simply
devastated Albany iii the nightcap.

Actually. LcMoync's 23-4 rout in
the second game was caused in part
by their t3-it victory in the first
game. The Danes outplayed their
talented opponents, outltitting Le-
Moyrie (l4-l2). committing fewer
errors (2-5). and perhaps most
frustratingly. Albany jumped on
LeMoyne to build leads of 4-0 and
9-5 before letting the game get
away. After coming that close. any
Danc letdown ~— evcrt a slight one
--— was crtough to produce Lc-
Moync‘s romp.

From the outset. it appeared lhc

Moync and continue thcir four

More Aggressive,

by Eric (.‘rubcr

“They were just more aggressive
than us." complained Albany
women's tennis couch Peggy Marin
about her tcam’s 5-2 loss to Army
Saturday afternoon at West Point.

Mann believes that her team
might not have been as prepared for
the match as they could have been.
“Becausc of conflicts with classes."
noted Mann. “many girls can't at—
tend rill practices. Army doesn't
have this problem. They practice
five days a week. two hours a day.
That time is just for tennis."

Mann also felt the use of no—add

error. With Rhodes aboard.
Tony Moschella blasted a towering
shot to straight away centerficld
that carried out of the field for a
two run homer. staking Albany to a
lightening-quick four run lead.

But that lightening struck more
than once. and in the second inn-
ing. LeMoync got the spark. Using
four hits and a wild pitch by Dunc
pitcher‘Mike Esposito (which allow
ed two runners to advance) Le-
Moyne tallied four runs to tie the
score. and addcd a run it) the fourtlt
to go ahead. 5-4.

The Danes then came through
with their second big inning of the
game, as they plowed into the lead.
Rich Cardillo started things off with
a blast over the lcftficld fence for
Albany‘s third horric run of tltc
game. and it kriotrcd lhc contest in
5-5, sending LcMoync's pitcher to
the showers.

Mike i’iorito followed ('rirdillo's
shot with a ground single to left.
Gary McCarthy‘s bririr resulted in a
late throw to second, and Rivera‘s
single past lltc first base brig lorrdcd
the bases. Antrtlck smacked ri Iinc

center tied the game at 9-9. Two
more base hits handed LeMoync an
ll-9 lead. and brought on Rich
' Woods to pitch for Albany. who
got a ground out to end the long in-
ning.

LcMoyne picked up one run in
both the sixth and seventh frames.
and the Danes went into the last in-
ning trailing 13-9. Fiorito flied out
but pinch hitter Jim Lynch came
through with a double to right.
Rivera walked. and Antaiek's single
up the middle scored Lynch from
second. Rowlands then also singled.
and Rivera came around to bring
.the Danes to within two runs with

cond. Those runners did not move,
however. as Arcario flied out to left
and pinch hitter Kevin McNeer
struck out.

Albany again took an early lead
in the second game. coming up with
two runs in the first inning. Le-
Moyne reached Dane hurlcr Jim

team on poaching, and have them
play lots of Australian doubles

Tomorrow‘s match against
Vassar will be on the Dutch Quad
