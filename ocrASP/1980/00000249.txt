April 22, 1980

it might have been poetic justice;
that a team from Albany would win
the second annual Albany State-
Molson Challenge Cup Series in
double overtime againsr Bingham-
ton. After all. Binghamton had won
it in overtime against Albany the
year before. it seems like tlte perfect
revenge, like — poetic justice.
Maybe 50. except unlike last year.
this time it was not Albany's
A-team whose fate was deterntined
in the final game, rather it was the
relatively unfavored B-tcttm wltose
hustling brand of hockey lead them
all the way to victory and kept the
Challenge Cup here in Alharty.
The series opened Friday after-
noon at University Gym witlt the
heavily favored Albany Arteam tak-
irtg on Union. To say that Albany-
A titerer defeated Union would be
a strorlg understatement. consider-
irtg that Union did have some per-
sonnel problems (not all their
players could arrive on little). the
Albany intramural all-stars easily
destroyed Union's teartt by a score
of 15-0. It was a Rort McManus
goal arid four others tltat followed
which set the tempo of the game.
Arid while the shooters were scor-
ing, goalie Bill Springer, tltouglt he
was hardly tested, posted a game
shutout. Alortg with Sprirtgcr's fine
efforts. what lead Albany to their
dominating victory was the ex-
plosive scoring at the outset of the
game. That was learn captain Rich
Levinson's ganicplan arid it work-
ed. “An ilttportant fact in the game
was getting the first goal. 1 like a lot
of pressure immediately. ()ur first
line came otrt attd crushed them."
Levinson said. ironically, it late ad-
ditiolt to the learn. Larry Forte,
lead all scorers with four goals.
Following the Albany-A
massacre of Union, Albany-B took
the floor against RP]. After a fairly
even first period. RPi‘s Mike Walsh
beat B-team goalie Carl Wolf'son on
the long side to put Rl’l out in
front. But quickly Mike Schwait/
of Albany scored on a backhand
shot off the centering pass of Doug
Gombert to tie the score at H.
Later iii the second. Mike Walsh
scored another. bttt that was all Rl’l
was to get as Patti ()'t’onnor tied
the score again for Albany-B. with
Jay Gottlieb. Dottg (ionihcrt. Barry
Levine and George Baldwin all
following suit. Despite tltc (v2 final
score. The game was a lot closer
than it scented. as Albany only
broke the game open in the third
period. Afterwards goaltender ('rtrl
Wolf'son said. “it wasn‘t that bad.
we just simply outplayed thcrn. This
is the tightest lcam I‘ve played
for.“

So it was. that Albany A and it
had won their games of the lourna»
lllent. The llL‘\l day. both tcitrns
returned to continue the
preliminary competition.

The next team on Albany»A‘s
schedule was the University of But»
falo. who were dressed iii the
jerseys of the Montreal ('ltriltrlians.
This tinte. l€d Hcltcinguld was in
goal for the A-tclim and did a
trtasterf'ul job. But. once again,
Albany's fotrr goals in the first
period. sparked by Rob Miller's
unassisted goal from behind the
crease at tile 1:27 mark. proved
Albany‘s dominance. The final
score: Albany-A l2  llrtivcrslt)’ “l

set ups. “When your teammates set
you up like that. you can‘t help but
score." said the A-team right
wrnger.

While the A-tcam rested. Albany-
8 faced off against Buffalo State.
Here. too, Albany changed goalies
as Steve Dipressi took over the
goaltending chores. a position he
kept throughout the sries that earn-
ed him MVP. After a rugged first
period in which both learns traded
goals. it scented that Buffalo State
had the upper edge. The second
period was more of the same. ex-
cept cacll team exchanged two goals

rather one as Mike Schwartz and,

Bill Condon scored for Albany-B
arid Bryant and Ruggi scored for
Buffalo State. As the ltorn sounded

boasting their two wins. squared off
against Oneonta for first place in
Division 1 of the tournament. The
battle of the leaders began with
ﬁerce end to end action. Unlike the
other two games, Albany did not
jump out to an early lad. in fact.
the A-tcam fell behind as Onconta
drew first blood. in the opening
seconds of the second period John
Esposito seltt the puck back to the
poirtt where a waiting Tony Belio
fired a game-lying shot. Belio then
went on to score again on a hard
wrist sltol making the score 2-1 in
Albany‘s favor. And that‘s the way
it ended as goalie Bill Springer pro-
tcclcd tltc slim lead by never allow-
irtg another prick to enter tltc net

Poetic Justice: Albany 3- TeamReigns

Segal had given Albany a 2-1 lead. a
bench clearing incident took place
just as the second period came to a
close. This caused a great deal of
confusion as head referee Nate
Salant assessed over 45 minutes in
penalties.

Despite the constant traffic in the
penalty boxes. no other changes oc-
ctlrred in the scoring. as John
Hickey and Keith Martin played
outstanding defense and Albany-B
stayed alive ill the tournament by
virtue of a 2-1 win.

Titus. entering the playoffs were
Albany-A and Oneottta of Division
I and Bingharnton attd Albany-B in
Division ii. The first playoff semi-

squad. The problem was that the
one goal by Binghamton was one
more than Albany had scored; the
final score was [-0. Albany’s best
opportunity occurred when Paul
Webel took a shot that bounded up-
wards of f the goaltender's body and
almost fell behind him. For a se-
cond year in a row, Albany-A had
lost to Binghamton by a margin of
one goal in the playoffs. After the
game. Levinson commented on the
final l-O score. “What can you say
about a 1-0 game? The ﬁrst team to
score can usually win, but they
scored first. so that's ltow it goes."
Levinson explained.

Goalie Ed Scheingold blamed the
non—scoring on a lack of good
shots. "We did ltot get one good.
clear shot at them. They played a
totiglt defense," said Scheingold.
