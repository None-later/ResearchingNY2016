by Larry Kuhn

On a perfect day for tennis. the
Albany State men's tennis team
provided a thrilling 6-3 victory over
Middlebury College at home on
Saturday. The match was a classic
Albany-Middlebury clash which
could easily have been decided by
a toss of a coin rather than by four
hours of grueling tennis. Unfor-
tunately. the victory was marred by
an injury to Middlebury's third
singles player and they were forced
to forfeit two matches that could
have changed the outcome.

"Overall, Middlebrrry is just as
strong as we are — maybe even
stronger." said Albany tennis conch
Bob Lewis. "We are very evenly
matched teams. Every match in the
last four years has been either 5-4 or
6-3. We were fortunate to win this
one. They had a real tough break."

The matches themselves could
hardly ltave been closer. Five of the
eight matches played went to three
sets each. in singles action Albany's
number one player, Larry Llnett,
grew sharper and sharper as his
match wore on and he easily
defeated Fain Hackney. 6-3. 6-3.

“l felt i played well." said
Llnett. “i felt i was able to control
the tempo ofthe match. When I felt
he was gaining momentum t slowed
it down. When i was playing well i
picked up the pace. That's the kind
of match i like to play — where i
am in control."

Linetl had a little trouble with
Hackney's serve, but he managed to
hold his own ser’ve. and at 3-] he
got a service break. “i ﬁgured if i
could break him once. that would
be enough," he noted. “A power
player gets discouraged when
you break his serve His strategy

worked perfectly in both sets and he
coasted most of the way.

in secOnd singles, Barry Levine
posted a strong come-from-behind
victory over Tom Donner. 3-6. 6-3.
6-2. “After a slow start Barry
played real well." commented
Lewis. Albany's 2-0 lead dissipated
quickly as Randy Young and Andy
Diamond each lost in straight sets.
"Young is having a lot of trouble
with a blister.” Lewis noted.
“We'll have to rest him a few days
next week."

Dave Lcrner's tough loss in sixt'.
singles. 6-3. 4-6. 3-6, put Albany in
a difﬁcult situation. The only
niateit still in progress was third
singles, which saw Lawrence Eiehen
hooked in a seesaw battle with Mid-
dlebury‘s Ron Pinsky. A loss for
Albany would mandate a sweep of
tire doubles competition for them to
pull out a victory. Pinsky took the
first set. 6-3. but Eiehen edged him
in the second. 6-4.

The third set was a struggle all the
way with neither player giving an
inch. Eiehen pulled out in front at
5-4. but then faltered and failed to
hold serve. Pinsky roared back.
taking the lead at 5-6.

Then came the ttrrning point of
the day. Eichcn served al 0-2 and
during the subsequent rally Pinsky
got catrgirt leaning the wrong way
and when he tried to quickly reverse
direction he fell to the ground
writhing in pain. He had to be
helped off the court with a badly
twisted ankle and was unable to
contintre — forfeiting the match to
Eiehen.

“That match could have gone
either way." said Lewis. "But they
had a real tough break when Pinsky
couldn’t continue." Unfortunately

for Middlebury this was the first
time this year they had failed to br-
ing an alternate so that in addition
to forfeiting the singles match they
were forced to forfeit a doubles
match. Tile tide had suddenly turn-
ed. Now Middlebury was in need of
a sweep of the remaining two
doubles matches to salvage the vic—
tory that was within arm's reach on-
ly moments before.

Both doubles matches were cliff—
lrangers. Llnett and Levine teamed
up in first doubles against Hackney
and Donner. The Middlebury duo
found the right formula iii the first
set. winning it. 6-]. [be second set
was probably the most crucial set of
the day. Linett and Levine jumped
on top at 2-0. but couldn't hold on.
They grabbed the lead once more at
6—5. but Hacktiey attd Donner
brought it even once rriorc forcing a
tiebrcakcr.

With their backs up against the
wall. Linetl and Levine rallied and
won the tie-breaker. 5-l. After tltnt
they could do no wrong as they
stung the beaten Middlebury team
6-I in the final set to wrap up the
match.

“They knew they had to win and
they did a good job for us," said
Lewis. “They both showed a lot of
courage after losing the first set and
then cornirtg back to win the
ticbreaker. They (Hackney and
Donner) were dcmoralized after los-
ing it — they thought they had the
match won."

Llnett noted that “they went for
a lot of big sliols. It's easier when
you're ahead. but when you’re los-
ing or tied it's a lot harder. The bal‘.
starts hitting the net more."

In second doubles Eiehen and
Diamond were in a similar pressure

played simultaneously and up until
the last minute theirs could have

freshman pair came through ad-
mirably. They were blown away in

' . New SA Attorney" sought

 

Lester Condemns. “1 1 th Hater” Actions

by Aron Smith

A search committee for a new SA
Legal Services attorney is rushing
through candidate evaluations in an
attempt to make an appointment
before the new SA administration
takes office. according to SA Legal
Services attorney Jack Lester. The
rec'ent cf forts of the Legal Services
Task Force were not made public at
all. said Lester. denying concerned
students and campus groups a
chance to participate in the at-
torney’s selection.

“They're trying to put the deci-
sion through in the eleventh hour of
their administration." said Lester
of the task force. formed by outgo-
ing SA President Lisa Newmark.
“They‘re not being fair to the new
administration that has to deal with
the attorney."

Legal Services Task Force Chair
Brad Rothbatrm and three other
members of the group were chosen

by Newmark. The remaining three
members were chOSen by
Rothbaum. Newmark and SA
Director of Legal Services Ron
Hock serve on the force in non-
voting. advisory capacities.

“There wasn't enough input
from different groups who have ex-
perts in legal services. such as
NYPIRO —— or from one of the
cultural groups. like ASUBA. Fuer-
za Latina, and JSC." said Lester.
“Shouldn't there have been at least
a notice in the AS "

According to Rothman. the
members of the task force chosen
by Newmark were selected on the
basis of experience. “She told me
that we were to begin the search as
soon as possible." he said.

A Problem of Communication

Task force members Audrey
Blume, Jeremy Orden. and Jeff
Weincr claim that they were
unaware of the committee's ex-

istence until just this past Sunday.

“I was notiﬁed Sunday. but I was
only informed that i could attend
these meetings." said Orden.
“Monday. I attended the ﬁrst inter-
view. 1 was given the chance to help
evaluate the candidate. and I was
unknowingly made a member. I
thought that this might be just a
token gesture." be said.

Yet three days later. Orden 'and
six others had reviewed the applica-
tions of eight candidates for the
position of SA attorney. an 81 1.000
to 513.000 position.

“We're not dealing with petty
cash." said Blume. “i think this
should get an important priority.
and go slow in the decision-
making."

Newmark took her hurried ap-
pointments lightly. “it was just a
problem of communication." she
said.

S UN Y Budget May Boost 22M

by Laura Fiorentino

After remaining in limbo for the
past month SUNY's budget situa-
tion improved Monday as a $22.3
million appropriations bill (UNI)
was introduced into the New York
State legislature. '

While the New York State Senate
voted last Thursday against the
restoration of SUNY's budget.
"their real intention was to override
Carey’s veto for all higher educa-
tion." according to Deputy to the
Chancellor for Legislative relations
ilcrbcrt (iorden.

“()n the floor they said it was a
mistake. they did not want to sus~
tain the veto," ("rorden said. H'l'hc
prohieru was that the SUNY system
appeared iii a different part of the
budget than BUNDY and CUNY
aid." ire added.

Carey‘s proposal for the '80-'81
budget included a two percent
ﬁnancial cut to affect all state frnrd-

cd sectors. and an additional cut to
the SUNY system. resulting in a
total $226.] ttiilliorr nid decrease.

According to SASU represen-
tative Ilruce Cronin. the Democrats
voted against SUNY Thursday. to
force Republicans to negotiate with
Carey on the revenue sharing sec-
tioir of the bill.

The Democrats want the
Republicans to pass the revenue
portion of the birdch to raise an ad-
ditional revenue for the state
because (,‘arcy claims the state does
not have enough trrorrcy. said
('ronin.

'i'lrc UNI bill was introduced into
the Senate by Senate majority
leader Warren Anderson and
Senate Higher Education Comrnit-
tee Chair Kenneth Laanle and in
the Assembly by Assembly Speaker
Stanley Pink and Chairman of
Assembly Higher Education Corn-
nrittee Mark Siegel. '

The bill. however. is not without
regulations. Under the restrictions
section of the bill it says SUNY is
directed to maintain its current level.
of institutional and program offer-
irtgs.

According to SASU Communica-
tions Director Pam Snook. the bill
will pass because the entire
legislature has set “SUNY as a
priority and they are rioping that
the governor also makes SUNY a
priority." Governor Carey’s press
secretary Mike Patterson was
unavailable for comment.

Snook went on to say that she felt
the legislature was embarrassed
because SUNY aid was still outstan-
ding while both CUNY aid ($5.3
million) [and HUNDY aid ($10
million) had passed.

According to Garden. the bill has
gone through the Assembly ways
and means Committee and is
