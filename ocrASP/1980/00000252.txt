waiting to be voted upon. Next
Monday, Gorden doesn't expect
any problems with the bill's passage
because he feels there is strong sup-
port in the Legislature.

But, even if the bill passes in the
Legislature, the ultimate decision
lies with Governor Carey. and the
Chair of State Division of Budget
Howard Miller. According to
Snook. Miller's ofﬁce is where the
"buck stops in New York State."
Miller could impound all or some of
the $22.3 million. Mr. Miller was
unavailable for comment.

The claims on the posters of Vice-
Presidential ltopeful Mark

delayed the task force because “my
mind just wasn't into it" after the
recent SA election fraud scandal.

"That’s funny." said Lester.
“My view is that they‘re trying to
tnake this decision their own. I
don‘t see how a few weeks will
make any difference." Lester cited
his own appointment. which occur-
red is midsummer and took effect in
the fall.

Newmark began the search after
receiving indications that Lester
may not return in the fall. She
claims to have discussed this
possibility with Lester as early as
last October. when a salary increase
for the l979-80 acadedmie year was
negotiated. Newmark claims to
have plainly told Lester that SA
could not afford to grant a further
increment in I980-81. as he
demanded.

“I have to look at the long run."
she said. “If salary is not a variable.
then I have to look at what is a
variable. After I Inade the decision
to search. he (Lester) said maybe he

being fraudulent.

“What actually happened is that
this was my Student Services Com-
mittee project last year." Baitman
said. “I came up with a charge for
this group and talked it over with
Dean of Student Affairs Neil
Brown. Then we went to Mark and
asked him to pass this through his
committee. which he did. That was
his only involvement. He didn't do
anything substantial."

Lafayette could not be reached
for comment.

“I am coming from the outside."
she said.

Sidoti hopes also to bring
together groups such as SU. SA.
and Off Campus Association
(OCA) on issues such as security.

Jim Castro-Blanca said he thinks
“SA is in trouble."

“We need to motivate peo—
plc...get people involved." he said.
"I care about SA and the
students."

Castro-lilanco said also that “SA
should take stands on issues." as

that's what he stressed. It was my
responsibility to see that we’ll be

“I was told that he wanted more
money. and that after three years it
might be time for a change." said
Rothbaum. "I have picked up a lot
of feedback about lack Lester. and
it‘s been mixed. All those factors
:ombincd led to the formation of
the committee."

“What I told Lisa is that I didn‘t
want to sign a two—year contract."
said Lester. "When I came to
Albany State I made a three-year
commitment. and three years is
enough for anyone.” Lester stress-
ed that he remains uncertain as to
where he will be working in the fall.

According to Orden. Lester was
not informed that a search for his
replacement had begun. “Jack
found out about the search for a
new lawyer through the grapevine."
he said. “As far as I know, Brad
tRothbaum) did not tell him
:ither."

Between Sunday night and Mon-
day afternoon. in the ﬁrst 14 hours.

“We should use our power

member of the committee." said
Orden. “I thought I was there just
to observe. I did not feel that I was
in a place to question the judgment

of the person who appointed me." v

“I was charged with a respon-
sibility. and I did not know that
that included working with Jack
Lester." said Rothbaum.

Both Lester and SA Vice Presi-
dent Tito Martinez believe that the
entire SA Legal Services Program
should be reviewed before a search
for an attorney is undertaken.

“Before we look at a new lawyer
or even see if we need a new lawyer.
let's say ‘stop’ — let’s look at the
budget operations." said Martinez.

_“Let's look at the student interns.

Let’s see if they need to be
