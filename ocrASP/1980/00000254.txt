Sectual Sex

The United Church of Canada is
sure to get some raised eyebrows
over this one.

In what may be a ﬁrst for an edict
on sexual ethics from a church. the
United Church of Canada —— the
church with the largest Protestant
denomination in Canada — says
that married couples shouldn't
worry about being completely
faithful to each other.

In a report on sexual ethics. the
Church also stated that sex between
singles can be rigltt under certain
circumstances, and that homosex-
uals should be admitted to tltc
ministry.

Said the Reverend Dr. Robitt
Smith ttbout the new edict, "We'll
get clobbcred for this by some of
our members."

No More Nuts

Here's good news: Americans

will no longer be considered
neurotic.
Tltc American Psychiatric

Association reports that starting irt
July, it will rctttovc the word
"neurosis" frotn the Association‘s
Diagnostic and SIrr/is'lical Manual
of Mental Dixon/em.

So what will we be called if we‘re
Ito lortgcr neurotic? From now on
tltc organization says if Americans
have problems, rather than calling
them neuroses, tltcy should be
simply considered "disorders."

Soviet Slip

' A Russian science journalist ltas
told Science magazirtc that about
1000 Soviet citizens were accidental~
ly killed in the alleged biological
warfare accident in the USSR last

tl

year.

The U.S. State Department
recently charged that several hun-
dred Russian citizens may have

‘been killed when Anthrax bacteria

accidentally escaped from a germ
warfare facility near the town of
SVerdIovsk.

The Soviet government denies
arty connection between the acci-
dent and germ warfare research.
However, Soviet ofﬁcials say that
some , residents of Sverdlovsk
became ill and died because of
Anthrax-tainted mcat.

Soviet journalist Mark Popov-
sky. lt0wcver. has told Science
magazine that he has learned from
sottrccs in Sverdlovsk that a
poisonous cloud of Anthrax
bacteria escaped from a germ war-
fare plant artd infected workers at a
nearby brick—making factory.

l’opovsky alleges that abottt 1000
deaths occurred. adding that the
figure would ltavc been higher ex-
cept for the fact that tltc winds car—
ryittg the gcrrtts shifted, carrying the
deadly bacteria away from tltc totvtt
itself. Popovsky claims a similar ac-
cidcrtt also ittvolvittg iiitliiy dcaths
occurred at tltc identical facilin itt
I958.

In his complaint. omzc'o claims
that in the middle of the unsuc-
cessful operation. he heard one of
his doctors say. “Oops. I cut in the
wrong place."

The Michigan Supreme Court
overturned a lower court ruling in
the case this week artd ruled that
Orozco has the legal right to sue the
surgeon who was in'charge of his
operation.

Chic Crime'

Studio 54. ortcc the disco, Mecca
of the jet set in New York City, ltas
been sold for at reported $5 million.

Former owners Steve Ruhcll and
tart Scltrager reportedly were forced
to sell the clttb after New‘ York
authoritics rcvokcd their liquor
liccrtsc. ,

Liquor authorities rcvokcd the
club's permits after Rtil‘lL‘lI‘ and
Scltragcr began serving tltrcc-atttl-a~
half year prison terms for federal
ittcontc tax evasion.

Tltc pair had stated when they
were jailed that tltcy would cott-

cd “to bring tltc club back to where

titled Naked Came the Stranger,
and its plot was cooked up by a
newspaper columnist named Mike
McGrady who set out to prove tha_t
anyone could write a best-selling sex
novel. ‘

McGrady asked 26 of his
newspaper colleagues to each, in-
dependently write one chapter of a
novel about a husband and wife
whose marriage falls apart because
of a string of illicit affair}.
McGrady says he gave his writers
only two rules — ﬁrst. there must
be an unrelenting emphasis on sex:
and the second was that “true ex-
cellence in writing would be blue-
penciled irtto oblivion."

Snort lt

Snuff — once the ragc dttrittg tltc
cightccntlt cctttttry — may be mak-
ittg a comeback.

The British medical journal
[.tllll'L’l reports that rcscurcltcrs
frottt tltc Lortdort Ittstittttc of
Psychiatry and New Cross Ilospital
nrc rccotttntcndittg that cigurcttc
smokcrs switch to snuff.

Lancet says that smokers could
switch to tltc scctttcd tobacco
powder "relatively easily" since it
would provide tltcrn with tltc some
surge of nicotine to tltc blood
without the harmful effects of in-
ltttling it irtto tltcir lungs.

Other advantages to snuffing
rather than smoking, says tltc
magazine, are tltc fact that snuff
docs not contaminate the at-
tttospltcre for non—users, nor in-
troduce any harmful by-prodttcts
ittto tltc user's body, such as carbon
tttonoxidc or rtitrogcrt oxides.

Lance! quotes the researchers as
saying snuff could still prodttcc ccr-
taitt components of tltc smoking
habit including a "variety of
aromas. attractive packaging and
intricate scrtsoritttotor rituals which
add to the plcasut‘c and social
aspects ttf tltc habit."

Attd tltal's notlting to sneeze
about.

Discwasher

RSO Records Itas cortte up with a
new process which tltc company
hopes will enable its investigators to
quickly spot courtterfcit records.

According to RSO's Al Coury.
each of the company's new albums
is being treated with a secret
chemical that is invisible to tltc nak-

cd cyc.
Ilowuvcr, by using special equip-
rttcrtt. anti-pirate investigators

reportedly cart spot tltc chemical
and tltcrcby tell it from a
counterfeit LP.

Although the process is rtot
rcgardcd as foolproof. Coury
claims that it should ltclp dctcr tltc
cottrttcrfcitcrs of ntost RSO albums.

Ilc says that the first album to be
treated with tltc sccrct chemical pro»
ccss is the ltec (‘tccs’ “Greatest
Hits" album.

The FBI has estimated that the
R50 company ttlnlic has suffered
losses of about 30 million dollars
ovcr the past two ycttrs because of
counterfeit :tlltttrtts.

'Home Work

ll. Lt New York organization has
its way, millions of women in the
future will be paid by the govern-

Page Nine

merit for doing work ‘around the
home

The organization crusading for

this goal is called "The Wages for
Housework Campaignr” Its presi-
dent,'-8e1ma James, contends that
most women are being systematical-
ly Rpped off by the America
economic system.
. As James sees it. millions of
Américtm'women are‘ toiling away
at home — doing the housework
and :taking care of children — so
that'thcir husbands can be free to
.toilaway at the ofﬁce. However.
shc~sayyi. while the man gets paid,
tIi'e woman doesn't.

Her solution to all this is in the
fOTnt .of three demands: ﬁrst,
women should be paid for their
housewogli. whether or not they are
marrieth pr’have children; second,
the pay should come from the
goVernmcnt; and third. the govern-
ment shotild get its money from big
industry.

Jamcsa‘rgues that industry is the
entity responsible for paying wages
for housework because industry is
the one who profits when a man.
freed of chores at home. is able to
work.

“If I lcavc. and there’s a good
likelihood that I will, tltcre has to bc
a good transition,” said Lester.
“We ltavc to get sotttcortc who's ac
ccptablc to all segments of tltc slu-
dcrtt body, ttot appointed by an ad-
rttinistratiott on its way out and not
accountable to tltc students. The
only real desire I have is that tltc
ttcw administration be able to do
this in a systematic, deliberate
ordcrly way." ,

According to Newmark, the new
SA administration will be given the
opportunity to participate iii the sc;
cond rottrtd of interviews, foi
finalist candidates. ‘

“They‘ll be asked to sit irt, but
what kind of input can tltcy givc‘i“
asked Lester. “There should he an
evaluation of the program, an
assessment of goals. Wltcn I came
on board, there wasn't really much
as for as a program. Thcrc were no
internshipsI no proactive program.
If I leave ltcrc irt tltc fall, I don't
want to see it all collapse because of
an administration that tttadc a hasty
dccisiott witltottt any tltottgltt. The
decisions that are bcirtg tttadc now
do rtot ltavc proper foundations."
lIL‘ said. “I want to feel, when I
leave, lltat I did all I could for the
program attd left it in compclcn
hands. It leaves a bad taste irt you
month if you come back six month:
later and it's dissipated. I’m at
employee of SA. What can I (ll'
about it'.’ What can I do bttt let it be
known?"

Council vs. Legal Services

Onc tlting that Lester will be do-
ing is appearing before Central
Council at its May 7 session, to ad-
vise its members to reject arty dcci-
siorts hastily made by tltc task force.

Central Council Chair Mike chy
believes tltat the task force is at»
tempting to push tltrottglt a pro»
postal as a rcsult of cortllicts bet-
ween Lester and SA. “It strikes me
as quite stupid to try to get rid of an
attorney becrtusc of a personal cont
llict," ltc said. “It’s a matter or
more a personal conflict than of
looking at what has been done. I
haven't seen Jack‘s record yet, but I
Iittally think he's got all the aspects
moving."

Levy praised Lester's perfor-
mance in forttting SA‘s Legal Ser-
vices Program over the last few
years, and favors granting ltirn a
salary increase if tltnt will be an in-
ducement for him to stay on.
