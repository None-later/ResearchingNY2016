the importance of Rivera's play, he
also praised his relief pitcher:
“Woods throws more off-speed
stuff than Dey or Mike Clabeaux,
who I was thinking of bringing in.
And Woods did a perfect job."
The Danes came up with the win
despite being out-hit, 12-5, and four
of Albany's hits came in'the seven-

run second inning. Matt Antalek ,

started off the big inning by beating
out a high bouncing chopper to se-
cond. Bob Arcario followed by also
grounding the ball towards the se-
cond baseman. who bobblcd the
ball, but still managed to throw An-
taiek out at second. Noonan then
pitched himself into trouble by

forcing in two runs. With the early

  
  

   
 

lead. Skeel decided to gamble on
the basepaths, and with Rivera at
bat, Skeel called for the squeeze
play. Tony Moschella came charg-
ing down the line from third. and a
surprised lndian catcher let the ball
go by him. bringing a run across.
Another attempt at the squeeze play
later in the inning was unsuccessful,
when the bunt attempt was fouled
off.

vexplained Skeel. “We have been

leaving men on base, and we were
hitting ground balls that could have
been turned into double plays. i

in that inning.

Rivera then singled up the mid-

Bruce Rowlands belted Albany's
first hard-hit ball of the inning — a

seventh run with a ground single. in-

the Danes had to rely on Dey and
their defense. A Rivera-Rowlands-
Rhodes double play shut the ln-
dians down with only one run in the
third inning. but Siena continued to
whittle away at the Dane lead. But
Dey stopped the lndians cold in the
seventh and eighth innings. before

  

giving way to Woods in the ninth.

"After we got the big lead, the
question was could we keep playing
good defense and get a solid pit-
ching performance." said Skeel,

Although Dey didn't pitch a

growth, still needs improvement,
but showed the drive of a winner on
Wednesday. And if it's become old
hat just to say it’s been the Danes’
best season to date, then amend
that to say that with the unique
combination of experience and
youth that exists only for this year,
the Danes are fast becoming
