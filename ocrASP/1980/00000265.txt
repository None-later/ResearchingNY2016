player Sue Bard lost to Sharon
Licbowitz. 4-6. 2-6. Licbowitz gave
Bard a hard time by spraying her
shots all over the court. Despite the

schedule with her. “Lisa will play
20 minutes one day. 30 the next and
slowly build up. She is still weak
and tires easily. She needs to build
up her stamina. i doubt site will be
ready before the end of the
season." if Dcncnmark docs return
to old form quickly. she will have to
play a challenge match with the pre-
sent number one player Light. in
what Mann concedes would be “a
very interesting match."

All that still remains in the
future. Now. the team must prepare
for the Seven Sisters invitational at
