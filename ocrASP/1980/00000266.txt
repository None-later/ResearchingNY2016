. Problems Plague Women As

Softball Team Drops Two

by Bob Bellaflore

Casual attitude. luck of com-
munication between players. lack of
mental toughness. unintelligent
play. and “dumb things" are what
have been plaguing the Albany
women's softball team this past
week. as tltey dropped two contests
— one to Siena, 20-9, yesterday.
and a tight decision to RPl. i4-l3,
on Tuesday.

All these things add up to a lack
of experience. according to Albany
women's softball coach Lee
Rhenish. “We ltave the capabilities.
There's no doubt irt my mind about
that,” said Rhenish about her
squad. “We have to learn to tuake
decisions in stressfttl situations.“
continued Rhenish. Site noted such
mistakes as throwing to bases tltal
weren‘t covered. not relaying infor-
ntatiou lo the outfield. and just a

lack of thinking on the ﬁeld as pro-
blems that are solved only “with ex-
perience.”

Against-Siam. Albany jumped to
a 5-3 lead after the ﬁrst inning, but
the visitors got four more runs in
the third. three in the fourth, and
then an eight-run barrage in the
sixth frame that clamped the door
shut on the Danes.

“We handed it to titem." said
Rhenish about yesterday’s loss.
citing ntore of those communica~
tiort problems between players as a
major reason for the defeat.

The Rl’l game also saw Albany
fall victim to over-conﬁdence. Scor-
lug eigltt rtrns in the top half of the
ﬁrst inning. the Engineers had picn-
ty of little (nine innings — women's
softball games are usually seven) to
chip away at the Dane lead. and
pull it ottt in the lust irutirtg.

“One of the things that hurt us is
that we get ahead right away and
then get back. and they catch us.”
Rhenish said. About RPl, she com-
mented, "They’re out to get you
every inning."

Lack of concentration reigned
there as, in one instance. it cost
Albany a potential run. While at-
tempting to beat out an inﬁeld hit,
an ’Albany batter was struck by the
throw. and awarded third base —
but she forgot to touch second. and
was called out on the subsequent
appeal play. Rhenish considered
this one of the blunders that “cost
you runs." .

A perfectionist. Rhenish strongly
feels that her team could easily be
90 instead of their present 6-3.
“We can't seem to be able to come
through in the clutch," said
Rhenish. “l'm most distttrbed
about the fact that we've lost games
that we never should'vc lost. The
three games we lost i see no reason
why we couldn’t have won." site
continued. '

Rhenish also isn’t satisfied with
the effort of her team, and isn’t
pleased witlt their attitude. She feels
that although they‘re tryirtg to "do
the best with what we have." she
isn't getting what she wants. which
is "I 10 percent."

"i hope our losses are ottt of the
way." said Rhenish. who felt that
the Danes need a “meshng
together.“ and site expects that in
come itt the next few games.

About Saturday's doubleheader
against Russell-Sage (which begins
at 11:00 am. on the Dutch Quad
field). Rhenish is optimistic. noting
Ilntt Albany has swept their two
previous twirrbills this season. “I
hope we can take botlr of those."
said Rhenish. “it's not a social or:-
cttsion. it's a game to be played.
Maybe they (Albany) can show
everybody what they can do. and
what they're capable of."

Three Victories

by Mike Ntlt‘lt‘rlt)

Saturday in l’lattsburglt. the
Albany State Rugby Club swept a
tri»nrcet with victories over the
Sarauttc Lake Rugby (‘Iub and l’lat-
tsburgh, and boosted their record to
4-0. There were big crowds on
hand, including a news crew and
camera crew from the local NBC
station.

In the day's opening game.
Albany faced the Saranch lake
tearrr. Few of the spectators gave
the Danes much of a chance to beat
their more practiced veteran squad.
but Albany had other ideas.

' Up against one of the top teams
in the northeast. Albany took a 10-0
first half lead. thanks to two scores
by ex-I'ootbail quarterback 'l'erry
Walsh. The Danes hung on through
a brttlal second half. and walked
off with a ltHi upset victory.

Next came a httttle of it tennis
front Albany and l‘laltsburgh.
After a somewhat sloppy start. both
teams settled down. The hittir‘g was
fierce with Albany dominating most
of the play. When it was over. an
Albarty squad had chalked rrp its se—
cond win of the day, as l’lattshut'gh
I'cll lit-ll). ‘

l'inally. it was little for the cott—
tcst that the crowd was waiting for

Albany A versus l’lattshurgh A.
lixpected to be a tight struggle. the
game was art Albany romp. The
scoring was fast and furious, with
both the bucks and the scruuuncrs
getting lli on the glory. Here. in
their second game of the day. the
Danes handed the Cardinals art llll-
pressive 23-0 shutout.

Ct'lttute hosts Albany this week
for it tough mulch.
