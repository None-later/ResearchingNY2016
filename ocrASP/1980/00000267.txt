“We deﬁnitely showed that we're
a running team,” said Albany head
coach Bob Munsey as his varsity

' track and ﬁeld team fared quite well

Wednesday afternoon in Andy Kerr
Stadium at the Colgate University
Relays.

Assistant coaches Kevin
Callaghan and Ron White led the
troops to Colgate “as the old man
let his kids take over," said
Munsey. who could not make the
trip north due to his teaching com-
mltment.

The meet was declared a non-
scoring affair which meant that no
team-trophy for overall ﬁrst place
was awarded. “This took a lot of
pressure off of the guys," sai_d
Munsey.

Albany's co-captain Jim Cunn-
ingllnm cashed in first on the day
for the Danes as he placed a close
third in the 400 meter intermediate
hurdles. His time of 57.0 seconds
was just .3 off the winning time of
56.7 seconds by Wallace of
Binghamton. Credit must be given
to Paul Eichelbcrgcr and Peter
Passidomo for their pcrformance in
that event. “Patti placed sixth ill
58.3 —- orlc second better titan his
personal best. i’ctcr never run in the
400 and broke one minute with a
59.9. These guys did one hell of a
job and they should be commend-
ed," said Munsey.

Although it was their best time all
year, :1 Dane 400 meter relay learn
composed of Bill Mccarlln, Tony
Ferrctti, Jeff Knight, and llowic
Williams took a somewhat disap-
pointing third bchind home team
Colgate and Mohawk Valley Com-
munity College, touching tllc tape
in 44 seconds flat. “We've got the

 

speed for sure, but they haven't
been able to get the stick-work
(passing the baton) down," said
Munsey.

Things started cooking for
Albany as the meet became one-
third old, for the Danes put four
guys into the 6400 meter relay
(Scott James, Mike Sayers, Bruce
Shapiro and Bill Mathis) not only to
come out with a ﬁrst-place finish.
but a meet record to boot, van-
quishing Hudson Valley Communi-
ty College's old record. The Danes
broke that 1975 mark of 18:05.9
with their time of 17:36.5.

This relay is a mere four
yards short of a comparable four
mile race. With James trailing in
second-place to his Syracuse com-
batant for tile first three laps of the
four lap stint, James shifted into
high gear as he handed off to Sayers
leading by 20 meters. “We were
hoping for a little tougher competi-
tiotl from Syracuse," said Sayers.
“1 really felt they'd do pretty well.
Scott was second with 300 tnctcrs
left but Syracuse couldn‘t believe it
when he handed off in front. When
it was Shapiro's turn, he broke it
open real early and Mathis coasted
home with the victory,” said an ex-
ubcrant Munsey.

Not to be outdone by the Danes

team of Mitch Harvard, McCartin.

the rest of the field in tile 8(10metcr
relay to give Albany their second

than Hudson Valley's second and

guys pulled it off with snper'perfor-
manee‘s," said Munsey.

The long jump team, headed by
Tim Gunther, produced a fourth
place for Albany behind Cayuga
Community College, Colgate and

Cortland. The Danes put together a ..

combined score of 57 feet and 3%
inches — two feet, seven and V4 in-
ches out of ﬁrst. “Tim’s perfor-
mance in the triple jump. (his per-
sonal best) made me extremely hap-
py," commented Munsey.

Continuing their winning ways in
relay events, the Danes, represented
by Williams. McCartin. Ferretti and
Mathis in the men's spring medley
relay. "won it big over Colgate,"
beating them by more than six
seconds with a time of 31:32.7. The
medley consisted of two 200 meter
lcgs followed by 400 and 800 meter
splits. By the time of the ﬁnal 800
meter leg, he "just blew them out,"
said Munsey in explaining Mathis'
sprint to victory.

The Danes finished tllcir scoring
for the day with a close third to
Hudson Valley in the 1600 meter
rcluy 111 3210.6 as Shapiro finished
his third event on the day. “Bruce
did one hell 0le job,“ said Munscv.

Last Monday, the Danes traveled
to ()swego in dual mcct competi-
tion. winning 82-63.

Two Capital District Rivals

Larry Linctt started the ball roll-
ing for Albany with a routine vic-
tory over Tom Crawford in first
singles, 6-1. 6-4. “Linctt playcd as
well as he had to to will," said
Lewis. “He's about back to where
he was last year."

in second singles, freshman
lltlrry l..cvinc fought back after a
first set loss to beat Sicmt's Davc
Munnix. “Levine got off to a slow
start, but played well 11] tile cod,“
notcd Lewis. in the first set he took
it 2-6 shellacking, but then turned it
around and trounced the
bcwildcrcd Mntmix, 6-0, in the sc-
cond, and put hiln away in the
third, 6-3.

The remainder of the singles mat-
chcs wcrc prcssurc matches. Andy
Diamond and Duvc l.crncr were
both forced to move tip two notches
on the ladder, and Kevin Laurilliard
and Dave Avcrgun were promoted
from third doublcs because of the
absence of lichen and Young. Ac-
cording to Lewis, “Diamond had
his lnulds full" and he lost in
straight sets to Chuck Kof—
fcnbcrgcr, 6-3, 6-1. Lerner had an
“impressive will" in fourth singles,
pouncing on Chris Arnold, 6-1, 6-1.

Laurilliard lost in straight sets
leaving Albany with a slim 3-2 lead.
That ptlt Avcrgun. playing in his
ﬁrst-ever singles match for Albany,
ill a key situation. if he lost they
would need two doubles victories to
win the match. His debut’was a
tremendous success. though, as he
pulled out a surprise victory over
Frazier Hancock. 7-6, 6-2.

Albany took their 4-2 lead irlto
doubles and the team of Laurillltlrd
and Avergun clinched the match in
third doubles with a straight sets

victory, 6—3, 6-4. The first doubles
team of Linctt and 1.cviuc also wonI
but the second learn, Diamond and
Lcrncr, wcrc outclasscd by Manuix
and Arnold, 7-6, 6-1.

Tuesday's match at Union was ti
tough loss for Albany hccause nor-
mally they could have beaten them.
but liichcn’s loss was felt more titan
against Sicntl. "We have a little
stronger team than Union," said
Lewis, "l'nt disappointed that we
lost —— 1 lutlc to Iosc to a (cum we're
better than. The rcnson we lost was
that Iiichcn was out and everybody
moved up one. One of our
weaknesses is that we don‘t have a
lot of depth. if we lost somebody
high on the ladder we're in trou-
ble."

Albany played well in first and
second singles with Linctt and
Levine each winning in straight sets.
“chinc played well and Linctt
played as well as he had to," com-
mcntcd Lewis. “He came from
behind to win both sets."

From there on the effects of
Elchen's loss became more evident.
Young, Diamond, and Laurilliard
all played up n notch and suffered
losses in straight sets. Dave Lerner,
playing in the fifth singles spot. had
a chance to evcn the match at three,
but dropped a very tough match to
Union's Steve Eskcnazi.

Lerner took the first set. 6-4, but
was barely edged in the second
when he lost a tlebreaker, 3-5. He
jumped off to a quick 3-0 lead in
the final set, but Eskenazi made a
great comeback to defeat him. 5-7.
“The key match was Lerner's."
said Lewis. “Tile loss meant we had
to sweep doubles."

Albany almost pulled it off. but

the loss of liichcn once again prov-
cd to be their undoing. Linctt and
Levine won easily in ﬁrst doubles,
and Laurilliard and Avcrgun team-
ed up to win an incredibly close
third doubles match, 7-6, 5-7. 7-6.
Diamond and Lerner. who don‘t
usually play doubles, couldn’t put it
together in second doubles.

“The second doubles team was a
makeshift doubles team," noted
Lewis. “They lost easily, 6-2, 6-2,
and that was the clinching match.
We didn‘t have the depth to win.
Union has a well balanced team -—,
good solid depth right down the
line." I

The Danes also had an away
match late yesterday against
Amherst. Tllcir next match will be
the SUNY Center Tournament at
Buffalo this weekend in which
they'll meet Buffalo and Bingham-
ton.

Linctt. Albany’s number one
player, has been playing well so far
this season, but Lewis sees the tour-
nament as “a good test to see if he
can come back from a poor perfor-
mouse in the fall."

“Linctt will have his work cut out
for him." he said. “He'll be facing
Binghamton's number one player,
Mark Lifschitz and Todd Miller
fronl U. Buffalo. Miller was the
runner-up in the SUNYAC’S last
fall. Linett lost in the semi-ﬁnals to
Binghamton's number two man."

The Danes have won the tourna-
ment the last two years, but Lewis
says that, “We have to get victories
from the lower part of the ladder.
Bingamton has a well balanced
team. We'll need a good perfor-
mance frotn the whole team to
win."
