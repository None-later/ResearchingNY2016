In Close Call Over Union

by Jay Glasen

You take a player like Rich
Heimerle. a four year veteran that
can stickhandle like some people
walk; a guy who can romp and roll
behind the goal and turn in for a
quick. unassisted score when the
Danes need one.

Take a guy like Tom Scarplnato.
a defenseman who doesn't know
the meaning of the phrase
“give-up”; a guy who can take the
man-up position and charge in for
an unassisted goal with the ease of

 

 

an eagle.

Take John Nelson on the attack
— a guy who scores on cue with the
drive of an army; a team igniter
who acts as the spark 'plug of a
V450 engine on offense — a winner.

Add about 15 more guys and the
feisty coach who puts it all together
and you have a winning Albany
State lacrosse team; a team that
gives up 14 goals but scores 15; a
team that makes a one goal dif-
ference a happy ending, a team that
showed ‘almosts' can be ‘reallys’.

Fielding Gem Lifts Batmen Past Siena, 7 +6 I

by Paul Schwartz

it happened so fast that the
Danes had to wait until after the
game to realize just how important
it was. One moment shortstop
Frank Rivera was edging closer.
ﬁnally settling right on the infield
grass. The next instance he was div-
ing — not along, graceful dive. but
a quick, daning one. Then he was
back on his feet. pouncing to throw
out the runner at ﬁrst.

it wasn’t even the final out of the
game, but it was the play the Danes

pointed to afterward as the most
crucial.

“Frank made a great play at
short." said pitcher Rich Woods.
“He saved the day."

"As far as l'm concerned. that
was the play of the game,” said
Albany baseball coach Rick Skeel.
“Rivera’s play won it for us."

The ﬁelding gem helped lift
Albany to a 7-6 victory over visiting
Sierra yesterday, evening the Danes'
spring record to 5-5 after their l7-l3
loss to Rl’l on Monday, while drop-

ping Capital District rival Sicna. a

Division l club. to 8-8.

At the very least, Rivera's play
kept the contest from going into ex-
tra innings. The Danes had sttrng
lndian pitcher George Noonan for
seven runs in the second inning. and
then hoped those runs would he
enouglt. as Sierra slowly chipped
away at Albany hurler Bruce Dey.
Dcy battled into the final inning.
allowing one run in each of the
third through 'sixth frames. but in
the ninth, leading 7-4. Dey gave up
a towering two run homer to
Siena's Chuck Sohl, cutting the
Albany lead to one run. After Chet
Smith smacked a hard double to
leftfield, Skeel took out his ace pit-
cher and brought Woods on for
relief in a tight spot — no outs, a
man in scoring position and a slim
lead.

"i felt pumped up," said Woods.
“l was warming up for four or five
innings, and l was really ready."

Woods got John Thompson to

~ ﬂy out to certterftcld. but Smith tag-
ged up and went to third on the out."

That‘s when Rivera came
through.

Skeel called for the Danes to

The opponent was Union, the
local rival who beat Albany 10—9
last year. But this time out. the lead
was Albany’s throughout, a close
and tight lead that Albany had to
ﬁght to keep. a lead that relied on
the necessary one-two combination
of the experience of Heimerle. Scar-
plnato and Nelson, and the young
team effort that kept the defense
mostly effective and the offense
pressing.

The win was Albany's third
against three defeats, and like last
week's close loss to Geneseo, the
Danes played four quarters of solid
lacrosse. handling groundballs both

handily and sldppily but getting

better and better at them, moving
the ball more. setting up the shots
quicker. making the sltots better.
The name of Wednesday's game
was “keep moving. keep pressing.”
and that's just what Albany coach
Mike Motta's boys had to do to
come out ahead.

l‘lt felt good to be up, good to be
winning." said midﬁelder Ken (lor~
man. smiling. “The team was
together and we played real well. it
got a little tough in the fourth
quarter. but we kept pressing and
Tom Pratt secured that winning
goal to keep us ahead."

in fact, that “tough” fourth
period was the only time (that
Albany as a team was really out-
played; but it was where. in times of
trouble. the experience of Heirnerle
took over. wltere Doug Dowd's ex-
perience also paid off with a goal.
and where a sparked neweomer like
Tom Pratt could also put in the
winning shot.

And what about the Albany
defense? For three quarters they
played beautifully. battling face-off
losses and Union onslaughts. but iii
the fourth quarter. they got sloppy,
giving up seven goals and almost
giving it all away. But they didn‘t.
and the early saves of Dane goalie
Ken Tirtnan helped make the fourth
quarter scores only a matter of
suspense.

“it was close,

move their infield in, irt an attempt
to cut down Sicna‘s possible tying
run. standing just 90 feet away.
Woods and his side—arm delivery
faced the next batter. “l was trying
to make him hit it on the ground."
said Woods. He did, bttt not where
Woods wanted it. The hard
grounder was smashed between
short and third — earmarked for
leftfield and an RBI. But Rivera
tnade a quick. diving backhand
stab. fielding the ball cleanly, got to
his feet, checked the rtrrmer back to
tltird. and fired over to Bob Rhodes
at first for the out. Still thinking
groundball, Woods then ended the
game by forcing Mike Tacliat‘crri to
bounce otrt to Rhodes.

“We go over that in practice."
said Rivera of his defensive play.
"We stress that you have to get dir-
ty — you have to play with reckless
abandon. We needed that play. it
was instinct -— either you conte up
with it or you blow it. You‘re either
the hero or the goat. l was fortunate
that i came up with it."

suspenseful." said defenseman Vic
Emanuello. “and it's nice to win a
one goal game.”

Motta. who kept busy all game
long setting up play after play and
calling strategic time outs, sees the
game as a perfect example of what
it should and did take to be a winn-
ing team —— good playing. good use
of time, hustling.

"The team played real well.”
said Motta afterwards. “The of-
fense was looking good and it was
real good to win a close one. Our
defense held them. and i think it
was a close match but we out.
hustled them and did the job."

Scoringwise. Albany’s ﬁfteen
goals were spread out among ten
players. and the Danes outshot

 

The Albany State baseball team held on to an curly lead to defeat Slenu 7-6  ,

Union in all four quarters. On the
groundball, despite some trouble,
Albany kept things pretty even
thanks to Hcimerle’s finesse and
some of little Warren Wrcy’s sheer
drive.

"it was close, but we out-hustled
them, and out-played them." in-
sisted top scorer Nelson. “We've
played two good teams (Geneseo
and Union). and just the couple of
goals difference got us a win. The
offense has been looking real good
lately. Rich (Heimerlc) played a real
fine game.”

Next on the Dane agenda is
Oswego. a breather of sorts. but
certainly not a pause. The momen-
tum has to be kept up to par. that

“Waterbury Cops” Quit Force

Cite Pressure FrOm (70- Workers

by Frank Gil

Due to pressures ttot to return,
Michael Buchanan and Richard
Vita. the two Albany Police Of-
ficers acquitted last October of
charges that they stole marijuana
and money front SUNYA students.
have agreed to resign from the
force.

Even though they were acquitted.
the officers still faced ad-
ministrative charges of neglect of
duty and could have been dismissed
if found guilty after departmental
ltearings.

Buchanan‘s attorney. E. Stewart
Jones. Jr., said it was “a combina-
tion of circumstances which forced
his client to resign.”

Jones stated three main reasons
for Buchanan's decision. First, he
said. the city was not desirous to
have Buchanan back on the force.
Second. Buchanan himself was not
desirous to be put back on the
force. Thirdly, Buchanan was
desirous of leaving the area attd go-
ing south.

Jones said. “if Buchanan had
decided to go back (to the force),
ltigltcr officials would ltavc made it
hard on him." Jones added that tltc
decision to resign did not take
anything away front the acquittal.

Vitn's attorney. Patti Cltccscman,
said it wotrld have bccrt tough for
his client to return to tile force after
the accusations.

Cheescman said, “Vita could
have ltad the hearing and won.
sought his position back, or retired;
instead of resigning." Clteesernan
added that he had no idea of what
Vita intends to do once tltc resigna-
tion is official.

When asked about the resigna-
lions. prosecuting attorney Dennis
Acton said. “it would have been
terrible if they had continued on the
force; i still feel they were guilty."

He added. ltowever, that it
would have been better if they had
been convicted."

Two SUNY'A student pro-
secuting witnesses said it was “an
outrage that the cops were getting
off so easy.“ They said their only
consolation was that "the ofﬁcers

When notified about the resigna-

in anti-nuclear. American lndian.
and feminist organizations; must-
cians Bonnie Raitt. John Hall. Pete
Seeger. Holly Near. Peter Yarrow
and Mary Travers, Blood, Sweat.
and Tears. and others provided
music appropriate to the rally’s
themes.

Citizens’ Party Presidential can-
didate Barry Commoner emphasiz-
ed an end to the proliferation of
nuclear weapons.

“No one can survive a nuclear
war...it is insane to ask people to
support a government policy of
nuclear weapons." said Com-

moner, “The ﬁrst step is to demand
the publication of the effects of
nuclear war. The second step is to

recognize that a nuclear war would
be suicidal.”

Although the Coalition does not
favor any particular presidential
candidate. Commoner mentioned
that he “does not support indepen-
dent Presidential candidate John
Anderson (R-lllinois).

“Anderson is what I would calla
pseudo-alternative," he said. "He
is pro-nuke and against labor and
the cutting of the military budget."

The actions of President Carter.
from his pro-nuclear stance to his
handling of the lranlan situation,
were condemned by several
speakers.

Daniel Ellsberg. a former U.S.
military systems analyst who made
public the Pentagon Papers com-
mented on the recent aborted rescue
attempt of the American hostages
in lran. “We will look back on this
‘fiasco' as a blessing." Ellberg said.

“if they had gotten in. there
would probab'v be war in lran and
50 dead hostages," he continued.
“Thank God Carter was stopped by

the incotttpetence of his own
weapons." ‘
Corrtmoner also stated that

“Carter is making a mess of world
peace." attd that “Carter was try-
ing to get himself elected with the
rescue attempt."

Several American lndians spoke
of "the lack of American lndian
rights" as well as tlte relationship
between the American lndian
movement and nuclear power.

“We are concerned with sacred
Mother Earth and her children."
said Russel Means of Lakota'Na-
tion. South Dakota. “Science is not

Voting Mix-ups Create Chaos

by Eric Koll

The ﬁrst day of SA elections did
not run smoothly, as certain voting
machines were broken or delivered
to the wrong quads, according to
SA Election Commissioner Ron
Joseph.

However. “quick action" by the
commission prevented any interrup-
tion of the election procedures, he
said, except for a malfunctioning
machine on Dutch Quad. Paper
ballots were used instead on Dutclt.

Delivery of the election machines
was first interrupted hours before
voting tintc when early Monday
morning Plant Department

ncmbcrs apparently delivered a
machine intended for Colonial
Qtrad to Aluntni Quad. the Dutch
machine to Colonial and left the
Alumni machine in the SA ofﬁce,
Joseph said.

The mix-up was discovered when
.loscplt rettrrrtcd to the SA office
Monday morning and found the
Altnttrti Quad election machine
there.

The Alumni Quad machine was
then brought to Alumni Quad.
Later. when Joseph learned that
Colonial Quad was given Dutch
Quad's machine. he switched names
in that macltinc from Dutch Quad
candidates to Colonial Quad can-
didates and left the machine on Col-
onial.

The reasons behind the mishap
are rtot clear. According to Joseph,
all five machines were clearly mark-
ed with “big red and white
stickers“ indicating on which quad
they belonged.

Sources inside SA speculatacd
that the plant workers may have

said that "plant department
workers did a great job helping us
move the machines after they found
out wltat happened."

in additiott, SA sources also sug-
gestcd that someone may have

deliberately removed the identifying
stickers off the sides of the
machines.

assembly Approves $22.3
Million to SUN Y’s Budget

The future looks bright for the SUNY system after a $22.3 million ap-
propriations (UNl) bill passed unanimously in the New York State

Although the New York State liegislatttrc voted against the restoration
of SUNY’s budget April 16. the UNl $22.3 million appropriations bill
was irttrodtrccd into the Assembly last Thursday.

According to Dcpttty Chancllor for Legislative Relations Herbert Gor-
don. the Legislature did rtot want to cut SUNY’s budget April 16, “their
real intention was to override Carey‘s veto for all ltighcr education."
The UNl bill, co-sponsored by Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink and
Chairman of Assembly Higher Education Committee Mark Siegal.
however, states that SUNY maintain its current level of institutional and

The bill is presently in the Sertatc Finance Committee and should be
presented for Senate debate “Wednesday or next Monday." said SASU

"There is a 99.9 percent chance the bill will pass." said Cronin. “All
tltc ltotshots (lit the Senate) are supporting it."

The ultimate fate of SUNY‘s budget. however. lies with the decision of
Governor Carey and Chair of State Divisiort of Budget Howard Miller.

fice is where the “buck stops in New York State.” Miller has the power to
impound all or some of the 22.3 million, she added.

The bill is considered a test of Carey's intent on increased spending.
Carey has said there may be room'for some pot sweetening in this election
year; but he is insisting that the Legisluture approve some additional
revenue measures such as higher fees and speeded up corporate tax collec-
tions to finance any full-scale restoration of his vetoes.

According to the Associated Press. ifMonday's bill becomes law. it will
raise the total appropriation for SUNY campuses to $740 million.
