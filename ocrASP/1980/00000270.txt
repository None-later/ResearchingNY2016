V “ Secretary of “State Venice Resigns Over Mission

WASHINGTON- (AP) — tions within the administration. 'There was no immediate indica-

Saretary of State Cyrus R. Vance,
apparently kept in the dark about a
decisive White House meeting,

resigned Monday in a public clash
with President Carter about the
aborted hostage rescue mission in
iron. ‘

An administration official who
requested anonymity told The
Associated Press that Vance had no
idea Carter intended to consult with
other key advisers abOut the rescue
operation at a National Security
Council meeting on Friday, April
11.

Vance was on a brief Florida
vacation. He returned after the
weekend and registered his disent as
a second council session April 15.
By then, according to this account,
Caner had virtually decided to ap-
prove the operation.

 

Vance quietly submitted his
resignation to Carter last Monday,
before the rescue attempt failed in
an ,iranian desert Thursday night
because of equipment failures and
other mishaps. Eight American
commandos were killed in an air
collision and their bodies were left
behind.

Sources said Vance was so upset

The administration official said
the Defense Department planned
the operation with almost no
margin for error. To succeed, he
said, e'verything had to go right.

The White House released an ex-
change of hand-written letters bet-
ween Carter and Vance that barely
touched on the disagreement. Still.
it was an extraordinary disclosure
of differences between a president
and one of his principle advisers.

Vance's departure prompted
speculations about other resigna-

Five RCO SUN YA Students

When was the last tirrre your tcrm

Indiana Conference? Five SUNYA

students were recently recognized

for their outstanding rhetoric and
communication papers, and were
asked to attend an Undergraduate

Honors Conference at Dcpauw

University, Grccncastlc, Indiana.

“K

Winning students Robert
Schmidt aiid Mitchell Wuldman will
be leaving Thursday for the con-
ference; unfortunately, the other
winners, Elise Greenspan. Sharon
Potoker. and Allan Spiro. will not
be able to attend.

The critical papers were originally
written for Dr. Katiilecn Kendall's
Rhetorical Criticism class (RCO
330) last Full. Tire papers were then
revised and submitted to the Con-
ference.

 

 

  

Defense Secretary Harold Brown,
who supported the rescue opera-
tion, denied he planned to resign.
So did State Department
spokesman Hodding Carter, Assis-
tant Secretary of State for public af-
fairs; Patt Derian, Assistant
Secretary for Human Rights, and
Richard Holbrooke, Assistant
Secretary for Far East affairs.

Carter, visiting wounded rescue
mission survivors at an Air Force
hospital in Texas, was asked by
reporters whether Vance's resigna-
tion would harm negotiations with
lran. “His departure did not have
any adverse effect on the rescue of
American hostages, nor will it in the
future," the president replied. He
called Vance “a ﬁne and dedicated
man" who had served the nation
well.

On Capitol Hill, many members
of Congress expressed regrets over
Vance’s resignation. Senate
Republican Leader Ted Stevens
called Vance “the calming factor in
the administration.” and Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D—R.I., said it
“could mean a more strident
foreign policy and a less steady
one."

The president's letter
acknowledged that Vance was quit-
ting "as a matter of principle."
Vance told the president he had
taken the decision "with a heavy
heart."

Neither letter explained the scope

the disagreement, but ad-
ministration sources said Vance
considered the operation too risky.

tion of who would take Vance’s
place. He had said he would be
leaving at the end of the four-year
presidential term, even if Carter is
re-elected, and Warren' M.
Christopher, the Deputy Secretary
of State, has been considered a
leading prospect to succeed him.

Christopher recently has taken on
a number of travel missions that
normally would have‘been Vancc's,
including efforts to persuade Euro-
pean leaders to support Carter’s
economic sanctions against Iran
and against the Soviet Union for the
Soviets’ intervention in
Afghanistan.

Vance, 63, is a veteran of the
Democratic foreign policy
establishment whose international
views underwent a major shift dur-
ing the Vietnam war. A former
deputy defense secretary, he
became a quiet advocate of con-
ciliation and a low-keyed approach
to world problems.

One of his principle interests, a
transition to black rule in Rhodesia.
was accomplished largely through
the offices of the British govern-
ment. Brit in arms control and
human rights, Vance saw once-
favored Cartcr policies take a back
seat to growing confrontation with
the Soviet Union.

erile Brzezinski, Defense
Secretary Harold Brown and other
key advisers to Carter were promi-
nent in the aftermath of the rescue
attempt, there was no sign of
Vance, even though he quietly

IRAN (AP) — Two American
fighter planes ﬁred on an lranian
patrol aircraft over the Gulf of
Oman to day but were chased off by
Iranian fighters, Tehran Radio said.

The state radio said the Iranian
aircraft was on a routine ﬂight over
the gulf when two American F-t4

Within about three minutes two

Although this is the ﬁrst time
SUNYA has submitted papers to
the RCO Conference. all live
papers were selected 'along with 36
others that were chosen nationwide.

The purpose of the conference is
"to encourage undergraduate
scholarship and to facilitate interac-
tion between undergraduate and
major scholars in the communica-
tion arts and sciences," according
to Kendall.

At the conference, the selected
students and faculty from all over
the nation will divide into groups of
about l2 to read and discuss the
papers.

Three of SUNYA’s winning
students were able to be reached to
discuss the intents and findings of
their respective papers.

Sophomore Mitchell Waldinun
wrote “A Generic Criticism of
Apologies.” Although the paper's
title can be intimidating, its aims are
direct and topical.

The nuclear issue was also tied to
feminism by several of the speakers
and musicians.

“It is impossible not to talk
about nuclear weapons as violence
against women,” said folk singer
Holly Near. “Women have tradi-
tionally been held responsible for
feeding, clothing, the necessities of
life. Our ability to stay healthy is
dependent on our environment."

The medical aspect of nuclear
power and radiation was discussed
by several physicians, including Dr.
Benjamin Spock. “The government
has not taken all the dangers into
account."

Singer Mary Travers, formerly of
the group Peter, Paul, and Mary,
said she feels the ‘80’s anti-nuclear
movement is not simply a nostalgic
‘60’5 movement.

“Things are cyclic,” she said.
“People tend to get involved in the
issues of their time...and the last
five years have been excruciatingly
