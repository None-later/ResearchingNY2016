Junkyard Junkies

Heroine addicts in New York Ci-
ty have reportedly come up with a
unique way to support their habits:
they're stealing sewer covers.

John Cunningham, of the City
Department of Environmental Pro-
tection. says in one recent two-week
period, for example. l4 of the
lSO-pound iron covers disappeared
from New York City streets. Says
Cunningham — in his own words
—- “Drug addicts are Iopking for
quick cash. Our problem is that
junkyard owners accept them.
Otherwise there wouldn't be a
market for them.”

According to Cunningham, scrap
metal dealers pay about three cents
a pound — or $4.50 — for each
sewer cover.

Cunningham says that it costs the

City of New York $125 apiece to
replace the covers. Says the city ol~
ficial, however, “The more serious
problem is the danger of
pedestrians falling into the open
sewers and the cost of possible
million dollar lawsuits." .

No More Farts

If you love beans, but hate the
embarrassing gas they cause. good
news may be on the way.

Dr. Brent Skura. a food scientist
at’thc University of British Colum-
bia, is trying to come up with a
gasless bean.

Skura says beans are a high pro-

people who eat them.

Skura is offering volunteers who
want to participate in his gasless
bean experiments $25 a day just to
eat beans next year sometime. The
researcher says he hopes his ex-
periments. which are the ﬁrst ones
using human subiccts. may develop

a new bean that doesn't give people
gas.

Harvard Hunks

Playgirl magazine, in an apparent
effort to parallel Playboy's search
for women of the Ivy League last
spring. has launched its own ad
campaign, looking for Ivy League
men to drop their tweeds for a
special nude layout on “Men of the
Ivy League.”

Seven Ivy League school
newspapers have already run the ad
which calls for male Ivy models who

According to Stone: “The grow-
ing gay population is largely due to
cannabis." Stone claims that pot
causes homosexuality in males
because it contains chemicals
similar to the female hormone
estrogen.

Pooh Got Nabbed

Winnie the Pooh's paws got in
trouble with the law recently . . .
but tltcy weren't in the honey pot
this time.

It all started when Winnie, who
was working at Disneyland. was ac-
cused of hopping a nine-year-old
visitor to the amusement park with
his paw; and lawyers for Winnie‘s
allcgcd bruised victim sued the bear
for $15,000 for negligence.

Winnie. ltowcvcr —— who was
really a Disneyland ctnploycc nam-
cd Robert Hill — took the stand in
full Winnie-thc-i’ooh garb and
denied the charges. \Vinttic said ltc
had been pushed accidentally from
behind and struck Dchhic Loch,
not with his paw, but with his fur-
covcrcrl wiggling plastic car.

After only 21 minutes of
deliberation, jurors acquitted the
happy hcar. Said Superior Court
Judge .lcrolrl Olivcr, who presided
at the sticky trial, “Winnie tltc
Pooh has been vindicated."

Only Playing

Here's a sign of the times: the
sales of various types of war games
have soared to record levels in the
United States and Canada.

The Canadian magazine
MacLean‘.r reports that North
Americans last year spent more
titan $23 million on war games and
related products, such as miniature
military ﬁgures —- tip 30 percent
from the year before. The market
for these games of physical conflict
is said to have tripled in the past
five years.

At the height of the Vietnam
War, tltc interest in war games
reportedly plttmntcd to a 25-year
low, but now interest in make-
believe war is soaring again.
