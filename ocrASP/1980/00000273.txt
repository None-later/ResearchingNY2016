‘A speculative professor once commented:
“i don’t like ‘A' students. They're fanatics.
‘3’ students bother me because they don't
know where they're going. But I like ‘C’
students. They're good average people. The
only thing ls that the ‘A' student will be the
professional." While he said it in a joking
manner. the reality of the suggestion was
undeniably there. We have become
something more impersonal than a walking
social security number. We, the diligent
students, have been rated, leveled, graded.
and marked for the future. it is no longer a
matter of what you know or how you reason.
Continuing education, the glorious institu-
tion known as college. has transformed the
average adolescent into pseudo-intellectual
zombies.

The naive and inquisitive high school
graduates look to college as a necessity. They
ltave been trained to cultivate the notion that
they must enter the collegiate world in order
to become successes in life. While they
recognize the pressures a more advanced
tcademic atmosphere will perpetuate, tltey
also imagine college will open new doors for
them and truly give then a valuable learning
experience. Some of these aspects are upheld
to an extent. but somehow. no one informed
the hard working individual ofavcragc cont-
petence that only a select few would actually
advance.

Recently, a professor. who is also a famous
and learned scltolar, approached tnc in the
classroom and began to question my ability
as a student. He did not ask me if] had learn-
ed from his class nor did he take an interest in
my general scholastice achieventent. No, he
questioned my grades. not being able to
decide if] was a ‘B', 'C‘, ‘D'. or ‘F’ student.
He already established that i was not an 'A'
student. subtly hinting at the possibility that i
was not even "bright." The professor sug-
gested that i was perhaps working below my
ability level. although i was working quite
hard to maintain my '8' capabilities. He later
admitted that he held more esteem for tire
fanatic ‘A' scholar. Needless to say, the en-
tire episode angered and lturt me. i always
assumed the duty of a college educator was to
assist in expanding my knowledge, rather
than knocking me down for being an average
student. But, the incident suddenly made me
aware of what education was all about.

College, this gloriﬁed high school. is a fan-
tastic mechanism for destroying hopes artd
dreams. if one does not adhere to the quasi-
air of professionalism, there seems to be little
or no hope for a comfortable future.

This professor perhaps echoed the views of
many a professional. Although students may
actually be absorbing vast amounts of

knowledge. the grades they receive are con-
sidered indicative of their intelligence. So.
the individual with a 4.0, who fares well
under pressured exams or cheats. will be
regarded with more respect than a 3.0 or
lower student. This is not always the case, as
there are many teachers who remember they
are also human. For the most part. however.
the transcript with the inﬂated cums will
guarantee entrance into grad school, while
productive activity and experience are of
secondary irttportance.

The student who attends college to
"learn," that wonderfully idealistic but ob-
solete term, finds memorization, cramming,
and “bullshitting” are the foundations of
higher education. Scholastic achievement is
determined through the competitive grading
process. How many professors will make
tests more difficult in order to weed out the
ineligible? There are very few people who
ttavc actually retained a good amount of
what they have been taught. But these same
individuals ltave been trained well to spew
forth inforrttation when a grade is a stake.
Professors ltave neglected to emphasize the
fact that book-smartness does not promise
anyone careers. in the long run. tltc only
place it holds any importance is in the col-
legiate institution.

This very same professor also mentioned
that i was somewhat quiet irt class. assuming
again. that l was not able to contribute to
discussions. i made it quite clear that i only
spoke when necessary, but this is not the case
for most “intellectuals.” Higher education is
a marvelous vclticlc for increasing onc's use
of rhetoric. in addition. classroortt discussion
often becomes a showcase for people who en-
joy flaunting their endless sources of
knowledge. My professor. and many others.
relish these "knowledgeable" individuals:
the “quiet” ones are not always up on things.
Silence used to be golden but now it makes
one somewhat below average.

i have often heard guidance counselors,
professors, administrators, etc. state that col-
lege offered people the final chance to ex-
plore. it was supposed to provide the matur-
ing individual with the last opportunity to be
relatively free from the “real world." What
the institution seems to have accomplished is
incorporate an undying sense of competition
into the growing mind. Perhaps the world
outside of college is worse, but higher educa-
tion has set some rather pressured standards.
intelligence can no longer be defined or prac-
ticed. it is merely judged.

There are few teachers who will give
students the opportunity to “raise their
grades." While they may consider this a

,Breakdownamatic'

To the Editor:

After waiting almost the entire academic
year. SUNYA was finally blessed with an
alternative to the check cashing service — the
Marine Midland Moneymatic Machine in the
Campus Center. However. it seems that our
good fortune was short lived. The machine
has been out of order on virtually every day
the machine has been operational. They are
constantly repairing it and it is constantly
failing. i’m sure that Marine Midland realiz-
ed that there would be a high volume of
students using the machine on this campus.
However, it seems that the machine cannot
handle the volume. i would sTiggest getting
another, better machine, but that would pro-
bably take years. Marine Midland should
concentrate their efforts on improving our
present machine. After having survived
check cashing, it scents that the students will
have to endttrc. as well as succumb to the
Moneymatic. or should i say, the
Breakdownamatic. The situation is absurd.
i'd rather walk to M.E. Bank or Key Bank.

instruments of Death

To the Editor:

Yesterday served as a reminder to myself
of the importance of staying involved with
the ever controversial draft issue. in case
sonic people are not aware of tltis. yesterday
(Sun. 20th) on Manning Blvd. the United
States Army was displaying one of its many
prized possessions. 21 Tank. Yes thats rigltt a
Tank, and a very large one at that. What i
saw though was not just a Tank but. ratlter. a
replica of the whole Military industrial Corn-
plex; the Tank just served as a symbol. What
scared me was that for years our grand-
parents and our parents have been paying
BiLLiONS of dollars in tax monies to create
these instruments of death. Even more amaz-
ing is that we continue to spend BiLLlONS
of additional dollars making weapons that we
are promised will never be used. Pcrltaps the
most frightening tltirtg is that the terrorists in
the Pentagon want very much to use these
weapons again. Hey. America is threatened.
we’re losing prestige in the Middle East.
especially in the Persian Gulf area, and now
it's time to get it back. What they don’t tell
you is that to get back this so called
"prestige" we must sacrifice thousands of
American lives, lives that are in their prime.
By the way. it‘s not prestige we're losing. it's
our influence that is being lost. This is
because EXXON and SHELL are not too
popular in the region any more. Because of
this they are telling us it is our duty to die for
their influence. Sorry, believers, bttt i don't
think so. Here's some more food for
thought. Russia is not threatening American
freedom, that is a pile of shit because all she

 

 

is doing is protecting herself, you know, set-
ting up a buffer zone in case we go into iran.
Also Russia is suffering the consequences of
that move ﬁne by herself. This idea can be
reinforced by some recent articles by George
Kennan on the subject. For those of you who
do not know who he is. he remains one ofthe
most knowledgeable men in America on Rus-
sian foreign policy. As far as iran goes, i
think if we didn't waste so much time draw-
ing up proposals that we knew were going to
be unacceptable, maybe our hostages would
be home. This. by the way, does not wash
iran's hands, for in fact she should be
reprimanted, BUT by the United Nations,
not the'United States. Our whole understan-
ding of the situation in the Persian Gulf area
illustrates nicely the incompetency of our
leadership, and what's more disillusioning. is
that we will probably be subjected to four
more years of incompetency. Then again. it
could even be worse: the other guy could get
in. you know, the fascist that used to be a
tnovic star. i could go on further about wltat
a joke our political system is, but that's
another issue. What i'rtt asking, in ligltt of all
that’s been discussed, is that y0u, the students
of this scltool, start thinking beyond the can-
dycoating fed to you. Oil is not a reason
for you to die. it is not your duty to do so nor
is it dishonorable for you to say “i‘m not go-
ing to fight your war.” l urge you all to get
off your asses and to look into these issues on
your owrt. discover the truth yourselves,
break away from the rhetoric given to you. i
mean. shit mart, this is going to be our wbrld.
God Dammit students, God Dammit
America. wake up before you die irt your
sleep.
Peace always,
Richard Dunne

 

Housing Blues

To the Editor:

“i hate this goddamn place!"

i ltave uttered this phrase so many times in
the past few days that my mouth is sore.
Why? Of course, it's because of our lovely
housing system.

This is my first experience with housing
and now i know why many call it the worst
time of the year. i would not have believed
that such an event could, in the span of 1
week, destroy friendships that ltad been built
for 2 semesters. My own personal housing
problem (along with my potential suitcmates)
has already led to violent words, threats and
accusations among us and many of our good
friends; plus. all i hear around the dorm are
more horror stories: no 4-man suites left.
potential roomatcs pulling otft at the last mo-
ment, etc. Friends become instant enemies at
the sound of a word. or a stare of the eyes.
Why this must happen. 1 dott't know; i was
going to knock the housing “establishment”
in this letter. but are they the sole cause?

Again, 1 don't know. What i do know is that',

for the last several days all my friends have
been at each other‘s throats.

i grieve for those who can relate to this let-
ter —, i know just how you feel.

The time is 1:30 -— in approximately 2

For You, Hugh

To the Editor:

This is an open letter to Governor Hugh
Carey who. like Senator Edward M. Ken-
nedy, President James Earl Carter iii
(pretentious name n’est-ce pas’I) is slowly,
but steadily, abandoning the "liberal" prin-
ciples of the Democratic Party. set forth by
Presidents F.D.R., .l.F.K., and L.B.J. (wlty
are they all known by their irtitials‘I):

Huglt, my friend, a iirm willed resolve to
consistently veto abhorrent death penalty
legislation, and date Anne l-‘ord Muzzelii,
will no longer suffice to upitoid your
enlightened-liberal. political stance. You
have cut youth job programs. mental health
services. and yes, you have cut state support
of post-secondary education (SUNY).

Hugh. Hugh, Huglt. most citizens are
aware of the painful facts: the state. and
the Union, are not ﬁscally sound. Budgets
ntust be cut. but must they be cut so in-
discriminately? New York State will pay
millions of dollars a year to provide upkeep
of the Lake Placid Olympic facilities. New
York State has offered to provide millions of
dollars for the construction of a new AMEX
building (American Stock Exchange), New
York State supports wasteful New York City
at the cxpcttse of the taxpayers of distant
counties, but New York State will cut furt-
ding of programs designed to aid its youth.
its ntcntally suffering, and its intellectual
reserves: all at your insistence.

Yes, Hugh, the budget needs to be
cut (perhaps drastically). but irt the last 20th
century. does one man itave the right to
singlehandediy veto budget resolutions that
his body of popularly elected, representative
advisors have found necessary? Where is the
democratic give and take between the gover-
nor attd the governed? Please note what the
late, great Hugh Carey has come to represent
in the way of cnliglttencd leadership. Budgets
ntust indeed be cut, but it is an unacceptable
notion that irt a democracy some must suf-
fer, while others quietly thrive. This is not the
principle that ottr nation, or our state, was
founded on. More equitable solutions can be
discovered; titcrc is a large reservoir of
talertted. cottcerned. and intelligertt groups
and individuals waiting to be heard. “Ask.”
Governor Carey," and ye shall receive."

Some More Apathy

To the Editor:

Why doesn’t a winning basketball team
build a followittg at SUNYA? Why is it that
we don't joitt the Alttrtttti Association upon
graduation'.’ Where is the feeling of ttrtity.
that sense of belonging with other colleges
across the cotttttry have? What does exist is
nptttlty!

it appears lliltl we. tltc University cout»
rttttttity, belich that ottt' school is little tttorc
than it place to study ot' relax for four years
before moving on. Little effort is made to do
anything else. Whether or trot the cause of
these symptoms has been correctly diagnos—
ed, the malady remains.

There are many aspects of this University
that remain unknown or untapped. There is
rttttclt to be offered. and it is ltcrc for the tttk<
ing. The Arts, Athletics tilitl Acttdctttics are
tops irt the SUNY system and provide us with
many activities and services rigltt on ctuttpus.
Each contribute to Wiltll is it rich and picn-
tlful cttvirottrrtcttt.

 

 

One has the opportunity to watch. par—

.ticipate in, or organize athletic, social or

community activities, absorb others or share

»one's own knowledge, and mature into well-

rounded adults.

With all that the University offers. it is un-
fortunate that wc lack the involvement and
pride which should be shared by all.

Hopefully one day we will all say, “i love
the University at Albany."

Out of Context

To the Editor:

i realize that you tried to make the best
possible decision. but your assessment of my
cattdidacy was a character assassination. As
the voice that speaks to i5.000 students.
almost simultaneously. you have a respon-
sibility to present your viewpoint, but to be
able to bttck it up with factual argument.

But many of the things you said, and many
of tire things you said I said. were taken artd
presented way ottt of context. and in sontc
cases are just piaitt incorrect — to present
them as my viewpoints is very wrong.

For instance. you seemed to say that my
future plans are based around
“fun—oriented“ projects. Btrt titesc ideas 1
gave were only irt response to when you asked
me at the interview. what i would do to cure
studcrtt apathy. it was only irt relation to that
topic did i give you plans to work on a
massive, campus-wide attempt to get l800
students involved in breaking the Guinness
world record for largest musical chairs game,
as well as continuing Homecoming and
Tcacltirtg awards. You hardly asked nor men-
tioned my future ideas concerning academics
and student services. it upsets tne that "hats
at basketball games" sticks in your mind so.

Later on, when demonstrating my
"character flaws." you say i said “whether a
person is competent or rtot doesn't matter as
long as he’s hardworking." But unfortunate-
ly. you neglected to mention that this was in
response to the question: “Could you work
with any of the candidates?," to which i said
yes. if] had to, i could work with any of the
candidates. and that in regards to my will-
ingness to work them. “whether the pcrsott is
competent or not doesn't matter, just as long
as he's hardworking." and dedicated. You
really took that one out of context. if you
just remembered my answer (with remember-
irtg the question which brought the response),
it’s no wonder that staterttertt “bothered you
profusely."

irt demonstrating my inconsistencies. you
say i pttt my trust in the SA President irt deal-
ing with the election cover-up. but thcrt
TURNED AROUND and blasted Lisa for a
weak administration. Because i believed that
the SA President ltnd the right arid respon-
sibility to deal with tile problcrtt as she saw it.
does that mean i have to love arid believe itt
her entire adntittistrtttion'.’ iler responsibility
of action itt tltc situation is ctttircly separate
from the performance ol' the rest of the year.
i dott't think it‘s fair ol' yott to expch rtte or
any other candidate to support either all of
lth actions or rtortc of tltcrtt.

lli stuttntnry, i would like to stress that i
am not criticizing your decision (although i
obviously do not ttgrcc with it). for that is the
honest opinion of the five or so members of
tire cotttntittcc, and to this you are dcfittitcly
ctttillctl. littt there were so lilitliy idcats attd
slatcutcttts taken out of context that l begin
to wonder ltow tttttclt you listened to tttc ditt-
ittg my itttervicw. My main objective is that.
although i ltttvc bcctt told tltut it was a very
tigltt race for the endorsement. these out of
context statements and the way the
paragraphs were worded lCiitl Ilte'reatders to it
conclusion that was absolutely false.

Dirty Games-Few Rules

‘Perhaps the very first issue our newly-elected SA administration should contend
with is campaigns in general. and their distastefulness in particular.
’ Though most of the campus is highly unaware of it. and perhaps even most can-

'didates, this has been one of the ugliest and vicious races in recent election history.

From the ASP’s end. we've received countless phone calls citing candidates and
their supporters with tearing down opponent's posters. replacing some with their
main. and printing false or “misleading” statements on them. We have heard
character and personality assassinations.

Many of the campaigns have been carefully shrouded with rumors. hushed
secrets, and underhandcd political tactics. And lies.

Exactly where all the information is coming from. or whether or not it can be
veriﬁed. is rather intpossiblc to gather. What does exist. though. is a general cam-
paign mentality.

Glancing around campus. one cart spot caravans of candidate supporters shufﬂ-
ing from quad to quad, fountain to forum. They bloek out much of the slight and
uninformed public by planting questions to their owrt candidates (who have careful-
ly prewritten answers) and prying opponents with others.

it makes us wonder whether it really is the bettering of SUNYA that tltey're after.

These people know who they are; their behavior is a disgrace to the campaign pro-
cess, to the students. and to tire legitimacy arid fairness of contests.

They flog the airwaves. ltog tltc forums, artd splash the podium with shabby
rhetoric and unwarranted defamation.

We, ourselves. itavc been so bogged dowrt with “tips” and “interesting informa-
tion" that it might take a special supplement just to reveal it all. But why waste our
time. Unless you're actively involved in tire jungle, you wouldn't wartt to hear it all
anyway. Or would you?

SA ltas accontplisltcd some great things in the past in areas ofacadentics, housing,
food. campus life, and more. Yet an abundance of unused potential lies chained
behind the paperwork and tire parliamentary procedures. We can only hope that this
energy can be tapped in the near future.

To begin with. serious artd radical changes ntust be tttadc irt campaign spending
(ranging front two bucks to tltrcc hundred. depending on ltow rich one is), campaing
behavior, tactics. forums. and procedures.

Channels will have to be opened, organized, and utilized, whereby students can be
made more aware of the candidates. the issues. and SA itt general.

Until then. the student majority can never take elections too seriously; this past
week’s chain of events ranks us similar to a pansied higlt school.

SA will have to slam the hammer down on these campaigns or we will soon be left
with several extremes tearing at each other’s guts.

Let’s cool it.
