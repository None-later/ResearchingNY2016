Lacrosse ’s Motta: “We qué‘Nowhe

by Jay Glssen

it’s easy to compliment the winn-
ing team and pan the losing one. A
ﬁrst place squad always makes good
copy and the basement team gives a
reporter a way to get some frustra~
tions out. But what does one do
with a team that can best be describ-
ed with such indeﬁnite phrases as
erratic. or unstable? A team that
wins nicely and loses badly. puts it
all together one game and then
takes it all apart before the next? A
team that makes the word
“consistent” seem like a foreign
phrase?

The Albany State lacrosse squad
is such a team. After evening their
record with an impressive, action
filled victory against Union last
week, they seemed to have left the
conﬁdence and spark of that gatne
back in the locker room. and took
to the road with about as tnuclt
vigor as a depleted oil reserve. The
results were obvious: an embarrass-
ing 9-4 setback against Oswcgo on
Saturday. the worst Dane effort all
season, and one very upset coach.

“After Saturday's game. we have

_ nowhere to go but up." observed a
disgruntled Albany lacrosse coaclt
Mike Motta. "We didn’t play well
at all. we made fundantental

mistakes, and we were out-hustled.
What more can i say?"

Not much. for the stats
themselves tell- the story well
enough. Albany was invisible dur-
ing the face-offs. unable to shoot
very much. of f target with the shots
they could get off, and virtually in-
effective on the groundball.

“The biggest problem was

definitely in the groundballs." said'

Motta. “We picked up halfas many
as against Union (34 at Oswcgo vs.
74 against Union), and we couldn't
generate any offense. So we got off
less shots (half as many as against
Union). We also had a lot of trou-
ble with the faceoffs. We only took
four out of thirteen, and that hurt
us too."

in fact, it would be difﬁcult to
find any part of Saturday's game
that didn't hurt the Danes. except
maybe the efforts of att;:.-kman
Mike Slocum. who scored three of
the four Dane goals and picked up
eight groundballs for the team higlt.

“Not one individual really stood
out other than Mike. Not on of-
fense or defense," Motta said.

And if one attempts to find ex-
cuses. otte would have to look deep
for this game, but the team did have
to head up to Oswego the day of the

 

Albany Student Press

game, a three hour bus trip that '

may have drained something other

than the bus’ gas. Also. Motta said .

that the team was “definitely over-
worked," but that excuse was not
enough to explain Albany's show-
ing in Oswego.

What else went wrong? The man-
up was completely ineffective, for
one thing, scoring only one goal in
seven attempts. The team cleared
the ball only barely adequately, and
the defense wasn't anywhere near
it's usual level.

And what of Oswego'l They're
certainly not a great team. and their
mediocrity only points more ob-
viously to the fact that this was
more Albany's loss than Oswego's
wm.

Now. the erraticness that reveal-
ed itself on Saturday makes the
future of the whole season seem
hazy. A Hartwick squad that's
about as good as Oswego is next.
today on Albany's home field. and
a, big game against last year's
undefeated Siena is sclteduled for
Thursday.

But after Saturday's stinger. tlte
words of Motta echo the sentiment
of the whole team and the re-
mainder of the season: They have
nowhere to go but up.

Friday. the Albany State
women's tennis team was somewhat
ttnsurc as to what the week-cud
would hold for tltcttt as they
departed for the Seven Sisters in-
vitational at Smith College. When
they returned Sunday nigltt. there
was no longer arty question; Albany
had tttade a respectable Showing

schools ill the northeast."

Originally. sixteen teams had
been ittvitcd to the tournament in
this. it's first year as an invitational.
Two teams made lute cancellations.
leaving fottrtcett competitors.

The invitational was arranged so
that there would he :1 singles and a
doubles tournament. Each tourna-
ment was to have tltirty-two seeds

consolation routtd for first round
losers.

In attendance for Albany, were
Nancy Light and Anne Newman for
the singles tournament. For the

ltcr fourth match of tire day. to
Brenda Bantu of Smith. 26. 4-6.

Newman won her first match on
Saturday, heating Casandra
Daugltinot of Barnard College, 7-5.
6-3, lit a match characterized with
long volleys. Dattgltinot was to later
make it to tltc ﬁnals of the consola-
tion round. Newman then met
Laurie Gurney of llinghnmton.
Ncwman. wlto lost to Gurney. 3-6.
3-6 itt their earlier cncottnter this
spring, did so again — this time.
0-6, 3-6.

it was itt the doubles tournament
that Albany was to shine it‘s
brightest, as the team of Bard and
Solomon proceeded ~to the finals of
the consolation round on Sttnday.
Things were not promising for them
on Saturday, as they lost to the duo
from Wheaton College. 4-6, 6-0,
5-7. But they came back in the con-
