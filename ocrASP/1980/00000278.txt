Albany mile-relay anchorman Tony

a twelve to fifteen yard lead over
the Binghamton runner (lane two).
When the latter began to gain on
Ferretti’s right side. doing what
Munscy termed "what his
(Ferrctti’s) instinct told him,” the
Dane elbowed his adversary, veer-
ing into the third lane, a clear in-
fraction of the rules. The rule states
that a runner must pursue a straight
path coming out ofthe final turn. A

Costly Error Turns

by Paul Schwartz

“Whenever you play on the road,
and you come back with a split,
there‘s no reason to be overly con-
cerned." This was coach Rick
Skeel's feelings about his Albany
State baseball squad's 5-0 loss and
10-5 win against Colgate on Satur-
day. ‘ -

But. the split could have, and
probably should have. been a
sweep. -

Not that Colgate didn't deserve
their shutout victory. The Danes
managed just six hits. and they left
seven men stranded on the bases.
Albany also committed two errors
~ and one of those miscues — in
the sixth inning of the opener — did,
the Danes in.

-At the start of that inning, Col-
gate was clinging to a l-0 lead, as
Albany pitcher Mike sposito was
effectively holding the Raider hat-
ters in check. Esposito got. into a bit
of trouble, though. when Colgate
loaded up the bases. But after two
outs. Esposito seemed to get
himself and the Danes out of the
jam by forcing the Colgate hitter to
connect on a fly ball to leftfield.

“That’s when thedam broke."
said Skeel.

Freshman outﬁelder Jim Lynch
came in a little. camped under the
falling baseball, and made the catch
—- almost. The ball popped out of
Lynch's glove. and with the runners
moving on the two—out fly ball, all

three runs came around to score.
The Raiders picked up their fifth
run moments later.

The difference between trailing
l-O and 5-0 became painfully ob-
viotts to the Danes in the top of the
seventh. After Bob Arcario flied

' out, Bob Rhodes walked, Rich Car-

dillo (five-for-six for the twinbiil)
doubled. and Mike Fiorito singled
to load the bases.

 

meet official disqualified the
Albany relay team giving Bingham-
ton the five points, which was just
enough to grab second place for the
meet.

“l was astounded at the referee's
call," continued Munscy. “because
it (the foul) just isn’t called, but it
was a gut call." Munsey went on to
note, "it's hardly ever called, but
that doesn't mean it isn’t wrong. i
can’t blame Ferretti for it."

Despite this, Munscy felt that
there were several “bright spots”
for Albany, the brightest of which
was Mike Sayer's performance in
the 10,000 meter run. in the event
for the first time this season, the
Dane junior won it in 31 minutes
“.7 seconds, almost one and one-
half minutes ahead of his nearest
challenger. More importantly, his
time was 3.3 seconds under the

mark necessary to qualify for the.

NCAA championships. He joins
Albany sprinter Howie Williams
(who qualified in the 200 meter
dash), as Dane representatives in
the meet to be held in late May in il-
linois.

in that race, Sayers lapped the
field twice except for second place
ﬁnisher Cliff Bills (Binghamtou),
who was only passed once. “We‘re
just tickled to death about that."
related Munscy about Sayers‘ run.
“if the competition had been bet-
ter, he could‘ve knocked thirty to
forty seconds off," he continued.
noting that Sayers had four laps (of
the 24 lap race) that were two or
more seconds over his 75 second
average. Munscy feels that those
thirty or forty seconds will come
“without any trouble.”

Bruce Shapiro also provided a
bright spot for Albany with his se-
cond place finish in the 1500 meter

run. Clocked at 3:58.9, he achieved

.his personal best. Also. Shapiro
notched third in the 800 meters in
1:57.4. l.2 seconds off the winning
pace.

Another smile-providing perfor-
mance for Munscy was had by Jim
Cunningham (55.8 seconds —— a
personal best) and was fourth in the
110 meter hurdles (16.3 seconds).
Pairl Eichelberg also hit a personal
best in the 400 meter hurdles. as he
was fourth in 58.2 seconds.

Williams was a double-winner,

Sweep Into Split For Batmen

“if we had gone into that inning
one run down. their pitcher
definitely would have felt some
pressure." Skeel said. “After we
loaded up the bases. there's no way
we don’t score runs if we’re only
down l-0.”

As it tttrned out. Albany came up
empty. Tony Moschclla struck out
and Frank Rivera hit into a fielders‘
choice for the final out.

Despite Colgate’s Division l
status, Skeel was confident his
squad would come back to take the
second game. “i was not happy
after the ﬁrst game.” Skeel explain-
ed, “but I knew we were going to
win the second game. They were
lucky to win the first one —— if we
had held on to that third out, we
would have beaten them. i expected
to win the second game."

The Danes got into the scoring
column with fottr runs-in the ﬁrst
inning of the nightcap. and they
posted an 8-0 lead before Colgate
picked up five runs in the sixth inn-
ing. Albany’s four-run first frame
began with a Rivera double, follow-
ed by Matt Antalek’s single and
Rowland’s two-run double. After
Lynch reached first on an error, Ar-
cario drove in a pair of runs with a
single.

While the Danes were busy piling
up runs, Albany httrler .iim Bittker
was no-hitting Colgate for five-and-
two-thirds innings. before tiring in
the sixth,and giving way to Rich
Woods. The solid pitching, combin-
ed with Albttny's ten rttns (and 15
hits) were enough to even the
Dane's spring record to 6-6. and
provide Albany with the only non-
losing record in the Capital District.
One member of that local group,
Sicna, is Albany’s opposition
tonight. when the Danes play a rare
night contest at downtown Bleeker
Stadium. Albany has faced the ln—
dians earlier in the spring. and came
away with a 7-6 victory. Yet Skeel is
not overconfident for tonight's
matchup:

“We mttst be able to hold them
at bay in the ﬁrst few innings," said
Skeel. “Otherwise it could be a
steamroller. And the fact that it is a
night game is going to help them.
We haven't played a game at night
this season, but Siena has."

Feud Over Election Methods

 

Causes Tabulation Delays

by Susan Milllgun

A "lack of communication" bet-
ween SA President Lisa Newmark
and Election Commissioner Ron
Joseph resulted in a feud involving
strong language. punches thrown,
and job threats. according to
Joseph.

Newmark and Joseph were in ap-
parent disagreement regarding the
relaying of election results. Joseph
planned to announce all of the win-
ners in a “press conference" in the
Fireside Lounge at 10:30 pm.
Wednesday. Newmark wanted to
have the results posted in the SA
Ofﬁce as the individual quad
returns were reported.

“l‘ve been a candidate and t
know what (election night) is like."
said Newmark. “it can really hurt a
candidate's feelings if he or she
finds out in public that he or she
lost."

According to Joseph, Newmark's
plan, which has been standard pro-
cedure in the past, would create
chaos. -

 

Election Commissioner Ron Joseph

“i didn't intend to post the
results and say “everybody
charge." Joseph said.

Section Vl-C of SA’s Election
Regulations charter states ”...the
commission will post in the Campus
Center as soon as possible after vote
tabulations the results of elec~
tions." However. Joseph noted the
rules “did not say i couldn't hold a
press conference."

According to Newmark, it was
clear on Wednesday afternoon that
the returns procedure would be
handled traditionally. “1 had made
a decision." said Newmark. “i
think since i appointed Ron as
Commissioner. l have jurisdiction
over him. We discussed it in the
afternoon, and he walked away. i
assumed we were doing it the way i
wished."

Joseph also assumed his plan was
to be implemented. “1 saw
(Newmark) Wednesday." he said,
“and she said ‘How are we going to
do this?’ i told her i was going
through withtmy plan), and she hit

me. i walked away."

The apparent nature of the
misunderstanding surfaced
Wednesday evening at Joseph‘s
suite. the site of the ballot tabula-
tions. According to Joseph.
Newmark. SA members Mike
Williamson, and Jim Mitchell arriv-
ed at his suite around to p.m.
“kicking the door. yelling, and
demanding to cotne in." Although
Newmark is technically a member
of the Election Commission by vir-
tue of her position as President,

Senate Elections May Be Invalid

by Eric Koli

Due to a possible violation of
election procedures by the SA Cen-
tral Council, this week's University
Senate elections may be invalidated.

The alledged violations were the
result of SA Central Council's deci-
sion which prohibited students
without tax cards from voting for
University Senators.

This decision was in direct viola—
tion of election regulations which
allow all students to vote for
University Senators whether or not
they have atax card. '

According to University Senators
and Central Council members, the
only way the regulations could be
changed is ifa specific bill regarding
the University Senate Election l’ro-
cedurcs is passed by a 2/3 vote in
the Central Council, according to
Senate members Mark Borkowski,
irtt Somach, and Mark Lafayette.

However, no such bill was ever
introduced into the Central Coun-
cil, voted upon. or passed. ttccor- V
ding to Central Council members
Frank Baitman, Ed Klein, and
Mark Lafayette.

“if a bill did not pass then it was
illegal to prevent a person without a
tax card to vote for the Senate,"
said Senate member Borkowski,
who is SA’s former Legislative
Coordinator.

“To my knowledge it was never

 

passed. We haven't passed anything
like it since I was there,“ said Bait-
man.

”As far as i know there were no
bills regarding University Senate
voting procedure cvcr brought up."
said Klein.

Both Baitman and Klein claim
that they've attended every Central
Council meeting in which election
procedures were discussed.

Central Council decided to let on-
ly students with tax cards vote so
that they would have a control
system. The tax cards were punched
on the voting line to prevent
students from voting twice. accor-
ding to Central Council Chair Mike
Levy and SA Elections Commis-
sioner Ronvxloscph.

“Foremost in everyone’s mind
was getting it system that would
work," said Levy who felt that

would work." said Levy who felt
that using tax cards was the only
“foolproof control."

Levy said that SA had the
authority to change the election
procedttrc and require all voters to
have tax cards “if that was the only
means of control available."

Levy. who was contacted before
the University Senate and Council
members were reached, was unable
to be contacted in response to their
statements.

At least one senatorial candidate
feels that Central Council’s actions
cost her the election. lrenc
Blciweiss, who lost the election on
Dutch Quud by two votes. claims
that two of her friends were not
allowed to vote because they didn't
have tax cards. Bleiwciss claims that
ltad her two friends been allowed to
