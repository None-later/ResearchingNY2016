Congress to Restrict Nukes V

WASHINGTON (AP) House-Senate conferees reached
agreement late Thursday on a compromise bill setting new/
licensing standards for nuclear power plants andTaising by
tenfold the penalties for the violation of safety rules. The
legislation, prompted by’the Three Mile island accident 13
..r‘tio'nth5 ago, now goes back to both chambers for ﬁnal ap—
proval-L’Undei' the measure, the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission would have to certify the adequacy of state
emergency evacuation plans before licensing new nuclear
power plants. This was a compromise between a Senate-
passed bill, flatly prohibiting nuclear plants in the absence
of state'evacuation plans. and a House bill without any
such restrictions. The legislation would also: (1) Raise civil
.penaltics from $5,000 to $100,000 for each violation of an
NRC order and make it a federal crime to violate NRC
orders and regulations during the construction of a nuclear
plant. (2) Require the NRC to consider the possibility of a
reactor core meltdown when deciding how far away from a
town or city a plant can be safely located. (3) Add 146 new
resident inspectors to the NRC's program. (4) Require the
NRC to notify governors when nuclear shipments are to be
llanspor'ted through their states. (5) Direct the NRC to
issue new standards for state emergency plans titat take itrto
account the Three Mile island experience. The new rule for
nuclear plants is part ofa bill authorizing programs for the
NRC for the remainder of ﬁscal 1980, which ends ttext
Sept. 30. it contains far fewer restrictions than nuclear
critics in Congress originally had hoped. Earlier attempts in
both the House and Senate to attach a moratorittrn on new
plant construction to the bill were rejected by wide margins.

Col. Cancels Rescue Attempt

WASHINGTON (AP) Col. Charles Beckwith,’ the tough»
talking Army commando leader, said Thursday he
unhesitatingly recommended cancellation of last week 5
hostage rescue raid in 1 ran because the breakdownpf three
helicopters made it too risky.‘Surfacing for the first trmc
since the mission was scrubbed, Beckwith made clear he
had no’ doubts that his recommendation was correct,
although he obviously was disappointed that long months
of preparation were wasted. The 51-year-old commander of
the 90-man Army-Marine commando strike force bristled
when asked about reports he wanted to proceed with the
mission even though he had only five usable helicopters.
one below what planners had fixed as a safe minimum.
“l'm not about to be a party to a half-assed leading of a
bunch of aircraft and going up and murdering a bunch of
ﬁne soldiers," Beckwith told Pentagon reporters. “l'm not
that kind of a man."

bassy in Londotr freed one of their British hostages today

Congratulations to the SUNY EOP students honored at
yesterday’s Fifth Annual Awards Dinner in the ('(
Ballroom.

The Committee of State University Special Progrrrrrr
honored State University Special Programs seniors l‘u
outstanding academic achievements.

All recipients of the award were chosen on a highest ctn‘
basis starting front 3.0. Among them was ASllllA l'tcs
dent Leander Hardaway who was a featured speaker at ll'
dinner.

The theme of the program, “Outstanding Acaderuir
Achievements of Senior Special Program Students." is ac
ccntuated by the fact that this year nrore titan 28,001
academically and ﬁscally disadvantaged students are in
volvcd.

According to SUNY Central Special Programs rcptcscn»
tative David Als, SUNYA was chosen between all the
SUNY schools to house the dinner because it was the most
“centrally located" and the “legislators who helped us are
here."

Als added that all students citosen for the BOP progrrrtrr
in general must maintain a 2.0 cum and continually short
progress.

Students, Ticket Thy/selves

The SUNYA Security Department is considering it plat
for this fall to involve students in issuing parking tickets on
campus.

Assistant Security Director John Henighan said that a
plan is being considered which would allow work study pro-
gram students to help SUNYA Police issue parkittg tickets.
According to Henigltan, this would provide added flexibili-
ty in assigning regular ofﬁcers around campus.

Henighan poirtted out that the City of Albany employs
meter maids to enforce parking regulations. freeing police
officers for other duties. The system is also used on it
number of other campuses.

When asked about the potential' cornplictlliom will!

dent that there would be no problems. He doesn't believe
that there would be a “conﬂict ofinterest" aruorrg studan

Physical Education Equipment

Sometime betwoen Friday even-

and that the goals and nets (located
on the practice ﬁelds just southeast

destroyed.

Siegel noted that the eight-year
old goals cost approximately $125
to $150 each and cannot be

SUN YA Praised for Access

Disabled Have Good Accommodations

by Leah Kraklnowskl

SUNYA has been ttttttted a
“model for access" for the disabled
in a recent report submitted to the
Higher Education Committee by
Assemblynran Mark Siegel.

According to the report, SUNYA
is one of two SUNY schools in the
SUNY system that meets full cont-
pliance with Section
504-Rehabilition Act of 1973 which
states that “no otherwise qualified
disabled individual shall, solely by
reason of his disability, be excluded
from participation in, be detried
benefits of. or be subjected to
discrimination uttder arty activity
receiving federal financial
assistance."

An inquiry into the status of ac-
cossibility for the disabled revealed
that 26 out of the 28 SUNY colleges
have failed to contpr with the

federal regulations of Section 504.
anti will be in violation as of .1 unc 1,
1980. Only SUNY Binghamton and
SUNY Albany have fulfilled 504 re-
quircments.

A self—evaluation of accessibility
on campus shows that SUNYA itas
been working towards botir ar—
chitectural and academic ae-
cessibility as far back as May 1965.
Major architectural modifications
such as access ramps to nearly all
buildings on the uptown campus
and living accommodations for the
disabled on State Quad which irr-
clrrde elevators to the ditting roorn
and bathroom/shower facilities
have been frilly completed and are
working effectively to provide ac-
cessibility to those disabled
students.

in order to ensure continued im-
provemcnts of implementation of

Section 504. a university-wide task
force, the 504 Concerns Cotnmit~
Ice, was established tirrcc years ago.
This comrrtittee, co-chaired by Bill
Roth atrd Gloria DcSolc of Afﬁr-
mative Action, is a multi-facetcd
organization that acts as it liason
between its disabled students and
the university while providing facul-
ty education for the handicapped as
well as continuous self-evaluation
of its accessibility.

The report released by the Cont-
rnittee on Higher Education cont-
trtertds Albany's successful efforts
towards complete accessibility for
the disabled, stressing the impor-
tance of SUNYA as a model for
other SUNY campuses to emulate.
As 504 Concerns Committee co-
chair Bill Roth stressed, “what
SUNYA has accomplished is an ex-

contintted on page fll'l’

open new accounts artd handle ex-
isting accounts. The credit ttttiort
will be open for two hours at the
beginning of each of the seven
orientation sessions," according to
board rrterrrbcr Andy Skurowitz.
“interest rates on all accounts are
bcitrg increased as of May 1."
Schilling said. “Basically, the credit
union's funds are invested in three-
rttorttlr U.S. treasury securities.
Over the past year, interest rates
paid on tirese have r'Scn dramatical-
ly front 12 percent to about 15 or 16
percent." he said. “We’rcjust pass-
ing the increase on to our
depositors. With the higher interest
rates the credit union pays;
depositors can earn more rttoncy
titan iii a savings or commercial
bank," ire said.

According to Skurowilz, “Tire
credit union has upped interest rates
1/2 percent across the board. Tire
new rates are as follows: 6 percent
on accounts of less titan $500, 6 1/4

 

 

percent on accounts of 33500-999,
and (t 3/4 percent on accounts of
rrrorc than $1000.”

Schilling explained, “Tire reason
the credit uniort cart give more than
6 percent interest is that it's not
governed by the same regulations as
commcriciai and savings banks.
They give a maximum of 5.5 per-
cent per year on regrtlar passbook
accounts. By law, the credit union is
allowed to give a maximum of 12
percent."

"We hope to be able to open stu-
dent checking accounts irt the near
future,“ Skurowitz said. “As more
people open up credit trrrion ac—
counts and our assets build." this
will become feasible. he said.

To facilitate more efficient corn-
putatiorr of balances and interest.
“the credit union is going on a com-
puterization system," Schilling
said. “Right now, all figures are
hand computed. This takes up a lot
