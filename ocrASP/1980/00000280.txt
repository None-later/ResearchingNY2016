Candidate Name Mix- Up In SA 'EleetiOn

by Susan Mllllgnn

Problems with SA votittg
machines continued this week as
one candidate received conﬂicting
reports on his victory. and another
candidate was left off the ballot cn-
tircly.

Off-Campus University Senate
candidate Gary Silvcrman was in-
formed Wednesday night ltc had
won a seat in University Senate.
Howcvcr, wltcn hc lookcd at the of-
ficial winning candidutcs posted in

the SA office, he didn‘t sec his
name written.

“I was a littlc surprised,“ said
Silverman. “I went into the SA of-
fice Thursday all confident that I
had won, and I saw that maybe L
hadn't."

Election Commissioner Ron
Joseph said that “lhcrc was a
mistake (in name transferral) and
Silvcrman is a winner."

The winning namcs were ap-
parcntly miscopicd from Joscpll's

Newmark-Joseph Election Feud

“shc was ttctivcly supporting a
prcsidcntittl candidate."

Assistant Contmissiottcr Stt/ttnnc
Korcn claimcd Ncwmtuk angrily
ycllcd, “I‘m f~--ing SA I’rcsidcnt,
you'vc got to lct inc in; I'm on thc
commission, lct mc itt — you guys
won't gct paid.“

Ncwmnrk admitted shc was
“annoycd and upset at tile way
(she) wits trctttcd," but dcnicd
shouting obsccttitics.

“i had a right to hc in thcrc,"
said Ncwmnrk. “I was cxpccting a
call at about it p.m. giving sonic
clcction results, and I didn't gct
one. I was there (at Jos‘cplt's)
because I wantcd to know what was
going on proccdurttlly. The election
was still tny responsibility."

Joscph said Ncwntark “just
wanted to be thcrc...to find out thc
rcsults."

Evcntunlly, Assistant Commis-
sioncr Mickcy Tarpinian, feeling
that Ncwmark and Mitchell were
"creating a disturbance" and
hindcrittg thc ballot-counting. call-
cd Dutch Quad dorm director Pat
Dowsc. At this point, anpinian
said, Williamson ltad left.

"i checked out the disturbance
call, and was greeted by Lisa and
some other guy screaming," said
Dowsc. “Lisa was saying IYou're
not doing this tltc right way...l have
to talk to you...You‘rc going to be
fired — I’m ttot going to pay you.‘
Eventually, I quictcd them down
and told Lisa she probably wasn’t
going to get in."

Tarpinian sttid tltat Ncwmark
thcn attctnptcd to enter the suite
while a resident of the suite walked
in. Tarpiniun said when he moved
to stop hcr, Ncwmark began pun-
ching him in the chest. Dowsc con-
firmed Tarpinian’s statement.

“I wanted to know what was go-
ing on,"Dowsc said. “I thought
maybe she had it right to be upset. I
talked to Ron, who said he had to
finish the ballot counting. Ron said
to Lisa, ‘Don't you want a fair clcc-
tion?’ and she said, ‘No, I want to
itavc it my wtty."'

Tarpinian confirmed this, adding
that he then askcd, “You mean you
don’t want (I fttir clcctiott?" 'I‘arpi-
nian said Milchcll's response was
"thcrc's morc than onc way to have
a fair clcction."

Ncwnuuk fccls sltc was trctttctl
bttdly as SA l’t'csidcnt and was
angry that slic wtis “dcnicd her
rights as a tncmbcr of thc commis-
sion."

“All I wuntcd was to have it done
tltc way it was tlonc in lhc past m i
didn't want to scc lllL' rcsttlts," shc
said.

Mitchcll, tt cttntlidatc ttttd not at
tnctnbcr of lltc commission, said ltc
went to Joscplt's sttitc liccunsc he
“didn't want Listt to walk over
alone." Mitchell said he made no
tittcmpl to cutcr thc room when: thc
ballots were, but feels Ncwmttrk

should havc bccn ttllowcd insitlc.

"Slit knockcd for IS tninntcs and
lllt.‘_\' wouldn't lct hcr in...shc got

Soon ttftcr Dowsc lcft tltc sccnc,

tltc SA ()fficc thc prcsidcntittl

the results in the SA Office and iii-
formcd a waiting crowd of about
200 in thc Fircsidc Loungc ot tltc
site of the clcction rctttrtts. 'I‘hc
rcs'ult, Joseph said, was at stutnpcdc
toward the office.

Both Joscph and Ncwtnark
stresscd that no tttmpcring of volcs
or ballots occttrrcd.

Joseph is angry at Ncwmark and
apologetic to those who waited
nearly an cxtra hour for the election
results, he said.

According to Wcinstock,
Newmark “was not being
unreasonable."

“The SA President has always
worked as a messenger of thc
results. Lisa had every right to bc in
that room."

Somach said he fccls “thch were
better ways to deal with the situa-
tion than the way Lisa handled
it...most people would probably
agree with Ron." -

Somach added that “SA clcc-
tions have not been the fairest in the
past. Lisa wanted to make it fair,
and Ron wanted to make it fair.
Both people went to extremes."

person involved with the mix-up
have been notified of their actual
states.

"I don't know who made the
mistake and it doesn't mattcr,"said
Joscplt. "It was an honest
mistake."

A mistake was also made in the
omission of Jim Castro-Blanco's
mum: in thc Campus Ccntcr
tnttc'hinc University Council.
Joscph noticcd the discrepancy

after voting was completed. Joseph
said he added the votes of the other
candidates from the Campus Center
machine and found that if they were
awarded to Cast ro‘Blnnco, he could
have conceivably won the election.
Joseph said he and Assistant
Commissionch present when the
mistake was discovered voted to call
Castro-Blanco and offer him a rc-
votc for University Council.
Castro-Blanco, however,
"graciously rcfuscd," Joscph said.

"I wasn‘t going to contest an
election in which i only won 52
votes,” said Castro-Blanca.

The reason for the mishap is
unknown, but Castro-Blanco seems
to feel there were underlying per-
sonal factors involved.

“Ron (Joseph) told me Lisa
(Newmark) was the one who wrote
the names on the Campus Center
machine," said Castro-Blanca.
“My name was left off. You ﬁgure
it out."
