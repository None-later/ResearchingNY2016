New Zukes

Now that “fast food” items have
grown from a simple burger and
fries to onion rings, chicken. pies,
corn on the cob. fried mushrooms,
eggs and sausages and steak and
fish sandwiches, yet another exotic
food is on the test market agenda:
zucchini.

Nation’s Restaurant News
reports that several McDonald's
outlets near the Oak Brook
(illinois) area are experimenting
with deep-fried zucchini as a side
dish.

The 3-ounce portions of fried
zucchini have been on the menu on
Ronald's home turf near the super-
chain’s world headquarters for
about three months.

The "McZukes" go for a test
market price of 85 cents.

Something to Hide?

Publication of a book about the
Central intelligence Agency's in-
volvement in the Middle East'dur-
ing the 1950’s has been delayed
after the C.l.A. insisted on review-
ing portions of and possibly even
censoring the book.

The book. which was scheduled
for release next month, is titled
Ropes 0f Sand-~A meriea '5 failure in
the Middle East. it was written by
Wilbur Eveland who claims he 5ch-
ed as the late C.l.A. director Allcn
Dulles‘s principal representative in
the Middle East in the 1950’s.

The C.l.A. suddenly demanded the

book for pre-publicatian review
after it had already gone to press.
and after galley copies had been
sent out to book reviewers.

The Agency, in demanding the
right to review the book, invoked '5
secrecy agreement which Eveland
says he never saw. Eveland says, in
fact, that he never actually joined
the C.l.A., and cannot recall ever
signing any promise to submit his
writings to the Agency.

Eveland says he wrote the book
because he thought “The American
people needed to be reminded of
the mistakes (American foreign)
Policy has made in the past and
continues to make today."

Tube Tied

Americans are watching more
and more television these days. The
Television Bureau of Advertising
reports that T-V viewing by the
average American household reach-
ed a record in February of seven
hours and 22 minutes per day.

That's two minutes more per day
than the level of about a year ago.
the bureau says.

Hand over Hangover

A chemical firm says it may soon
come out with an anti-hangover pill
-- a pill consisting mainly of ac-
tivated charcoal.

The Requc Manufacturing Com-

nany -— a firm which markets ac-

tivated charcoal in capsules for in-

ternal usc -- suggests that charcoal

the blahs of the morning after.

The company cites a recent Jour-
nal of Southwestern Medicine
report which found that boozers
who drank whiskey that had been
ﬁltered through charcoal had far
fewer and less intense hangovers
than did drinkers who consumed
unfilitered whiskey.

The Reque company says that
charcoal pill taken immediately
after a night of ltard drinking would
probably absorb most of the
headache-causing ingredients from
the drinker's system, thereby mak~
ing the morning after a lot easier to
handle.

 

Bogus Bulb

Three Phoenix, Arizona.
brothers have announced plans to
mass produce and sell Iltc world‘s

Page Seven

ﬁrst llghtless light bulb.

lnstead‘df being called “light
bulbs." the new invention by the
Bart brothers is dubbed “the dark
bulb."

How does It work? Well. to be
honest. it doesn’t: the ﬁlaments in-
side the dark bulb have been discon-
nected. and the bulb itself has been
covered with a black enamel.

So what's it for? A‘ booklet that
comes with the dark bulb suggests
it’s perfect for watching television
because it never creates a reﬂection
across the screen. This latest version
of the pet rock should also cut
down on energy bills too.
