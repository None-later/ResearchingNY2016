subsequently succeeded in closing that

of mankind; a foreshadowing of the time
when man's achievements may lead to his
destruction. What happened in Nazi Germany
could happen again. almost anywhere. and
not only to Jews.

The recent public awareness of exposing the
events leading up to and during the Holocaust
is a start towards awakening future genera»
lions everywhere and a warning of what may
happen when people are blindly unaware of a
potential danger or deny it totally.

The recent airings of "The l'lolocnustn on
national television are evidence to the fact that
the horrors which occurred over a generation
ago are just now being exposed. There are,
however. some controversial issues involved
in bringing the topic to the media.

Another movie was produced hosed on the
experiences

The Holocaust Survivors Memorial Foun»
dation is a group that wishes to remember the
events. record them. and educate people
universally on the topic, for the Holocaust is a
universal issue. Jack P. Eisner. President and
Founder of the organization. said. “we must
educate the young and point a warning finger
at the world in order to improve the human
capacity to coexist , . . Now is the time to
open our hearts and wounds, To take our ex-
periences with us as we pass from this earth
would be a disservice to mankind and to our
children."

The organization has developed a National
Oral History Project which wishes to docu-
ment. through accounts of survivors of the
Holocaust. the events which occurred before.
during, and after the persecution in order to
complete the historical record of what actually
happened. A conference was held last
February in New York City at which efforts
were made to establish a dialogue between the
survivars and people in the media arts. so that
authentic works mighth made on the subject.
Last April a similar conference was held.

The Graduate Center of the City University
of New York established the first institute of
Holocaust Studies in 1979. This institute is in-
itiating programs such as a research and
scholarship center for l'lolocaust-related pro-
jects. a public school teacher training pro-
gram. and lectures. The Foundation hopes to
establish more of these institutes throughout
the world.

SUNYA offers several courses dealing with
issues and attitudes concerning the l‘lriltiCiilibl.

child. Her father was in Auschwitz from 1941
until 1945. when they were liberated. She
said. “My father's not that emotional about it
anymore. although he used to be. He lectures
in high schools now. He does not want this
generation to forget. although he doesn't want
to dwell on the past."

Several SUNYA students felt that people
should be educated on the events surrounding
the Holocaust. Eddie. a freshman. com-
mented."l'm not tired of hearing it at all
because it really happened and i don't want to
see it happen again. Through people's
awareness of that possibility it hopefully Won't
happen again. l'm not Jewish and l’m not well
informed on the subject but i would like to
know how people could actually do
something like that to other people for no valid
reason."

Andrea added. “Most people say ‘Big deal.
it's the past,‘ History doesn't repeat itself. it's
the people who let it repeat itself. You should
educate people on the facts. but also tell them
personal accounts. or else it doesn't seem real.
it doesn't sound personal when you just hear
statistics."

Some students expres. d the feeling that
living in the New York metropolitan area
made them more aware of the topic than they
would otherwise have been. Stove. ii junior.
remarked. “it may not be in the area where i
live but in areas In the Midwestern United
States. many people don't know what a Jew
or a Black is. and have handed down to them
the stereotypical prejudices inherited from
their family. These prejudices could no doubt

 

about their recent past. for they feel ashamed.
However the schools in Germany are gradual~
ly beginning to teach exactly what went on at
the time,

Translations of many relevant works on the
Holocaust are being made available to the
public in the English language. A children's
memorial will be built in Yad Vashem,
Jerusalem to pay tribute to the more than one
million childrim who were victims of the
Holocaust. And April 13. 1980 was Yom Ha
Slioah. Holocaust Memorial Day. At SUNYA.
JSC-Hillel sponsored a Holocaust remem-
brance event on that day. in lsrael one minute

increasing educational projects and presen-
tations on the media of something as
devastatingly real as the Holocaust are steps
towards relieving all forms of persecution sucl
as racism. clnsslsm. and sexism. The existence
of groups today suc'i as the Ku Klux Klan nnr
the neo~anis. however. are evidence that this
goal will be difficult to iiclieve. Even now
some people refuse to believe that ilit.
