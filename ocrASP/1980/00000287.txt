anger. She found herself enough strength to walk out on the
perfect lover who offered her no more than her husband
had: cooking chores. sexual serfdoin. and whispered
nothings that added up to YOU can't leave me.

White resigned the following year; on clos-
ed circuit television he explained his fault. as
his wife often had -— he was a lousy corn-
municator.

ambassador to the UN. He had a strong
recommendation from the White House and

“How do you make sense out of this? When
we defeated the Germans. we insisted upon
the war crimes trial in Nuremburg. In this case.
we did not want to sit in Judgment of our own
soldiers at Kent State. The FBI recommended
a Grand Jury Investigation. the Civil Rights
Division recommended it — Nixon did not
want it . . . college students were ‘bums.’ "

“By the time they got around to it, too many
people couldn't remember and too much
evidence was gone."

Like many others at the time. Phil wanted
an investigation performed. Instead. several
students and teachers were indicted
"When. my god. no students or faculty
members shot anybody."

Phil and Elaine Anderson (now his wife)
released the study entitled Communication
Crisis at Kent State. Though it was received
with praise from similar authors and commis-
sions. it's content shocked the KSU ad-
ministration.

He stayed on to teach at Kent for another
year. leaving in the spring of 1971 for
SUNYA. He had found it difficult to teach
students after the incident due to their
disinterest in learning and the prevalent
rumors of FBI plants throughout the
classrooms.

"Nothing good so far as I can see has ever
come out of the Kent State Incident. I can't

One unusual conclusion of Phil‘s was that
there were no heroes here. “Such a big case
— so many people Involved —— in which there
were no heroes."
