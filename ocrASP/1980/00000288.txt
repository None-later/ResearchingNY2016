' Comment '~

Andrew Pulley fer President. Not only did
the editors discriminate against his running
mate Matilde Zimmermann in this. but even
a simple check would have told them that the
SW}: has never run Pulley for President
before. Any mention of Patricia Mayberry,
our local Congressional candidate, was
eliminated.

We were further told that a big vote for
Pulley “might indicate popular disillusion-
ment" with the imperialists’ war drive. "but
it probably will not persuade them away from
aggression." But no one has ever claimed
that a simple vote for SWP candidates would
persuade the rulers to abandon their class in-
terests in pursuing war.

What i had tried to explain was how this
vote could be part of the ongoing struggle
against war. instead. in the censored version.
the reader was given the studcrtt skeptic's
view of the socialist candidate as a political
Don Quixote.

Finally, we are told that “cotttirrg months
will tell" who runs America the warntakcrs
or “the people tired of war. selfishness and
misunderstanding." This scrttencc is a typical
expression of liberal confusion. What is real-
Iy unfortunate is that it bad to he lacked onto
an article whose ntaitt purpose was to show
that tltc currcrtt war drive has deep economic
and social roots, rather than sontc abstract
“selfishness and misunderstanding."

it is rtot my purpose hct'c to specultttc on
the varioris personal or political liit)ii\’L'\
which led Aspects' editors to doctor up rtty
article. ccrtsorirtg it irt thc proccss. litti ortc
obscrvation cart be made. which is that
SUNYA has ttot cnjoycd a vcry hcalthy
climatc for free expression rcccrtily. For ex—
ample, we see the efforts to clintinrttc
Tangent magazine because it tiarctl to
become, in the words of one studcnt
bureaucrat. a “feminist publication".

This climate ofintolerancc is rtot unrclrttcd
to the war drive itself. The first task of ti
rcgirttc wanting to drag its subjccts irtto a war
against their interests is to ttrrrt public opi-
nimt against any current — i‘ctttinist, lilack
nationalist, Lcttinist — that qucsrion its
prerogatives. At SUNYA this effort has
scored some modest successes. ii‘o bend to its
rcsrtlts is to further ertcottragc tltc forccs
behind it. Democratic discussion of tire issucs
in the world crisis cart only strcngtitctt tltc
strttggle against war. Censorship docs thc op-
posite.

Muckraking?

To the Editor:

l was looking through the April 29, 19th)
ASP and what did 1 sec on tltc third page? i
saw a story with the ltcadittg “Crtstt'o-lilnnco
called by .i-Bourd. Firecracker had injured
student." Well this sounds prctty serious to
rttc. When did it happen? i read on to fittd
out. it happened itt October — October! Artd
now due to the fine investigative and up 10
date rcportittg tltc ASP has finttlly let. us
know about this incident. Lucky for us tltcy
printcd lllL' story right during lltc SA clcc-
lions irt which Jantcs Castro-Blattco is a
prcsidctttittl candidate. What kind of
muckrakittg is this? i l'tlttlilt.‘ information
about candidates good or bad should be
printed to help us decide on the corrch
choice. but why not print tltc story before tltc
elections so Castro-lilttttco could reply. sincc
thc incident happened so long ago. l have
seen inconsistency in the ASP's timing of
stories before. bttt this is tltc ﬁrst one that in—
furiates me enough to rigitt a letter.

i find it very hard to swallow that tile ASP
was unable to reach Jean Strclltt for cont—
mcttt. Wltat did she do? Move to Alaska?
Further. the ASP statcs that since Castro-
lllttttco hits ttot corrtplicd with the judicial
rccotttntcrtdntiott. ltc has "been r‘c-rci‘crrcd
for rtot sending . . . (a lcitcr explaining what
happened) . . . to tire ASP." according to
one source. One sourcc. you got to be kid.
dint;- Was it just that Studio. the sour'cc, and
David Jenkins. associate dircctot' of residence
DTOBrLtnting couldn't be found bcforc
Tuesdays ASP? Tltc ittcidcttt httppcttcd itt
October.

 

 

If you plart on using these tcclmiqucs dur-

 

ing an election why don’t you do it for all the
candidates. Now, i don't know James
Castro-Blanco. ldon’t know ifl would want
to know him, and i am not sure as to his
qualifications to be a SA President. But. the
timing of thisstory annoys me to the limit!

Play With Words

To the Editor:

Tire Student Faculty Basketball game took
place on February 28th in University Gym to
benefit Telethon ‘80. During the course of
the game 15 blue and white alumni jerseys
lent us by tltc Athletic Department were
stolen from a box in the gynt. We appealed to
those who had tltc shirts to return titem, no
questions asked. Only two shirts have been
returned as of this writing. Wc are surprised
at iltc lack of considcration shown by tltosc
involved. if thcsc shirts are rtot rcturrtcd to
the Student Association officc, Tclcthott will
have to ptl)’ rttorc than $150 to r‘cplacc tltcrn.
This ntoncy will cotnc front luttds that are go-
ing to tltc Albany Statc Chapter of tire Big
lir‘othcr/liig Sistcr Program and tltc
Wildwood School for tltc Developmentally
llttrtdicappcd.

Wt.- hope that every titttc somconc sccs ottc
of thcsc jchcys ltc will rctttcntbcr' witcrc the
ntoncy that was used to rcplacc tltc shirt is

Budget Reply

 

lo the liditor:

l artt writing this lcttct to respond to the
ttllcgttlions rttttdc against iitrtigct Committee‘s
bundling of 'i'ztngcut Mttgrt/inc. Let me start
by saying lllttl littdgct L‘ornntittec is neither
power hungry rtor nni'cclittg. We have to
budch good programming that will rcaclt the
most pcoplc for tire lcttst ntortcy. so as to
allow rnorc good programming for tltc
studcnts. ’l'hc lindch L‘ontntittcc has already
l'urtdcd ovcr 70 groups at at cost of over
5466.000. 'l‘hc ttninforntcd pcoplc wlto ttrc
scrcanting mad about 'l'ttngcut have never
given thought that thc Comntittcc has otltcr
worthy groups to fund. too. thrt wc fttnd
S-Qttad and Middlc liartlt for over $20,000,
no one said it word. Wltcn wc l‘nndctl Off-
Cttntpus Association to purchttsc scr'cccltcrs
and door locks for womcn to protect
thctttsclvcs, no ottc praised us. When we gave
WiRA (wontcn‘s intrttnntr'ttls) twice its rttttclt
rttortcy as Inst year. no ortc cltccrcd us. When
we futtdcd “Atltcntt” (Iltc l"cntittist Alliance
Publication) for $1,000 no ortc cttllcd tts pro-
feminist.

if yotr talk to anybody on liudgct Commit-
tcc, (or rtrtyonc clsc within SA), tltcy will
hortcstly tell you that they do not cnjoy cut-
ting budgcts. Do yott I'cttlly belicvc that we
enjoy cutting tltc budgets of l’icrcc lltlll Day
(‘rtr‘c Ccntct', Mitidlc Earth, or Tttngcnt.

Wltctt wc finishctl with all the groups, we
were some SIS-20,000 over budget. Mor‘c cttts
had to bc ntttdc. lindch Contntittcc had to
make those cuts. it is itnpossiblc to plcrtsc
cvcryonc, but tltc cttts had to bc rttttdc. lfyott
truly feel that Budget Committcc is it stir-
cttstic, quick-axed group of irtcotttpctcnts, 1
risk tltttt yott cotttc talk to arty oftrs itt pcrsort,
to get our side of the story, hcforc you writc
ttnltti'orrttcd letters and dcrogtttory editorials.

Finally, if ttrtybody else feels that bcirtg on
the Committee givcs yott all tltc power, rtrtd
lets you “squelch cttthttsirtsnt", i suggest you
sit on next year’s bttdgct hcttrings. l tltittk
yott would bc grcutly surpriscd by what you
would scc.

Power vs. Power

Lack of communication and a crisis of authority between the SA President and the Election
Commissioner raised some serious questions that must be resolved. ‘

While the SA President is a member of the election commission by way of title, and no eon-
stitutional by-law bars her from interfering with its procedures, it would only seem ethical and
moral for her to maintain a low-keyed position in this area — especially after showing support
for a certain candidate.

Problems of involvement and conflicts of interests have arisen before when previous SA
Presidents were known to count ballots, even after publicly announcing their endorsement of
a nominee. ‘

Central Council should meet and seriously consider the issue for in the Gold/Schatsky run-
of f . it is crucial that the tabulations be handled by a neutral Commissioner and able assistants.

The Commissioner and present SA President must work out their difﬁculties way in ad-
vance of the voting's onset. .

it must also be made certain that no position hopeful is within throwing distance of the
ballots under any circumstances.

Remembering Kent

Like many Americans these days. we often sit on the fettcc and depend on the lawyer, the
clergyman. and the government to do whatever should bc dorte. Getting lost irt life‘s complex-
ities, we often feel too srnali to make a difference. But apathy can never be a part of our
rttakcups anymore. Apatlty is what caused “Kent State." '

Sunday is the l0th anniversary of tile tragedy irt which National Guardmctt gunned down

thirtecn demonstrating studcnts, killing four. 0ch it a rrtinutc of thought, utter a prayer for
your dead peers. and say a heavier one for America.

Keep Us On Senate

On chncsduy, May 7th. student representation on the University Scttatc will be discussed
and evaluated. tf studcnrs us a majority have learned anything since tltc turbulent 60‘s it is that
ortc must work within ‘thc systcm' to bring about changc and progress. For twelve years.
students on the Scrtatc have ltad a high attendance rate at tttcctings. Tltc considerable number
of student-initiated proposals proved that we have made a constructive and conscientious cf-
fort to irttprovc lifc at SUNYA . l’rcsidcttt O'Lcary has corttc out openly irt supporting student
rcps on llte body. On beltalf of tire university, we urge tltc Senate to do tltc some.

Apathy Reigns. . .Again

We ccrtairtly hope that the four rcrttairting SA ltopcfrtls arc refraining frorn too much
celebrating and congratulations. For the real wirtrtcr on Wednesday night was Abstairt. Abs-
tain received 7,100 votes attd is clearly the choice for our rtcxt SA Adntinistratiott. Shame on
you SUNYA...just what will it take to get you to votc?

But, of course. you can't answer this ortc — cltattccs arc you're ttot even reading it.
