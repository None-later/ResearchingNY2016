does Mr. Motta get John Nelson
and his offense. Richie Heimerle
and his midﬁeld. and Tom Scar-
pinato and his defense to put it all
together all at the same time? If the
potential is there, and the Danes
certainly I‘ch it is, then who's
responsible for the fact that it's not
jelling? Can it jail by Saturday?

Attackmaii Mark Watersiram
thinks it will.

"We've got to be ready on Satur-
day. and we should do better there.
We‘ve got to. We're a lot slower
than we used to be, and we seemed
to win before by speed, so we've got
to run faster."

Rcmarkcd a wistful Hcimcric.
“Wc had high hopes for this
season. Our only loss should’vc
been to Cortland. No team's been
much better than us other than
them."

"We've got it good tcani. but we

can't pull it together." said

Magrame. “Saturday we’ll pull it
all together. We had some breaks
and we weren’t in the right place at
the right time. but we will pull it
together."

With only four games to go in the
season, they must do so quickly.
Usually a team that starts off slow
and ﬁnishes with fury, a reversal of
that wouldn't do any good at all. So
the Danes know what’s needed of
them and they know that Hartwick
wasn't supposed to be. They know
that they haven’t been playing well.
and they know they've got to im-
prove. They know they’ve got talent
and they know they're not using it
to full potential.

The Albany State lacrosse team
knows a lot. But in light of yester-
day's demolition and Tuesday's
scare, the words of attackman Mike
Slocum sccmcd all too appropriate:
"I just don't know . . ."
