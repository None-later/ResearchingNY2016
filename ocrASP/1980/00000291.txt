Errors Plague 18-10 Softball Win

by Marc Hand

The Albany State women's soft-
ball team defeated the New Paltz
Hawks, l8-10. Wednday after-
noon in a game wh0se innings were
prolonged mainly by erroneous
fielding and erratic pitching.
Although this victory may not have
been the most artistic one for the
9-3 Danes, it was a win nonetheless.

in fact. this game provided
Albany softball coach Lee Rhenish
with an opportunity to utilize all her
troops in order to give them all
some playing time. “i used a lot of
people to gain experience." said
Rhenish.

ideally. this game might have
been the best one for gainingex-
perience. Mistakes were more the
rule than the exception. The play in
the ﬁrst inning seemed to be iri-
dicativc of the play of the entire
game.

in the top of the first, New Paltz
handily jumped out to a three-run
lead on pitcher Cathy Briggs’ ﬁve
walks and two wild pitches. So.
coming to bat for the ﬁrst time,
down by three, Albany needed to
get some runs back. And that's ex-
actly what they dld.

Nancy Halloran’s single and con-
secutive steals of second and third
bases sparked an eight run rally
which put Albany ahead to stay.

But pitching difﬁculties per-
sisted. prompting Rhenish to pull
Briggs in the top of the second and
replaced her with shortstop Lois
Ferrari. who did not have her best
stuff and gave up five runs over the
next four innings. Following Fer-
rari. the best stint of the day was
turned in by Albany's third reliever
Anne Solomon. who. despite giving
tip two runs in the top of the fifth.
settled doer to pitch two scoreless

innings.

The early pitching problems were
hardly felt as Albany’s lead
mounted. Unlike New Paltz, the
squad was able to successfully
capitalize on their opponents’ er-
rors and mental mistakes almost
every time. Timely hitting. or
perhaps timely contact on Albany‘s
part. was enough to bring in most
of the runs.

While it was a contest marked by
less than spectacular defense. two
infielders for Albany certainly
secured the diamond. immediately
upon being moved over to third
base in the rep of the second.
Halloran converted a tough ground
ball. with runners on ﬁrst and se-
cond, into a double play by stepp-
ing on third and gunning it over to
first to get the other force out. But
the inning was not over irrrtil second

J ayvees Split With Dartmouth

by Anthony lovelll

A very enthusiastic and spirited
Albany State JV baseball learn split
a doubleheader Saturday with Divi-
sion ‘l foe Dartmouth at Albany.
The split brought Albany's season
record to 2—4. The day before the
Jayvees earned their ﬁrst victory
when pitcher Mike Gatto mowed
down the Engineers of RPl, 6-I.
Gatto collected nine strikeouts in
going the distance.

The doubleheader Saturday saw
the Albany batmen take the final
game in dramatic fashion. 10-9.

After Dartmouth jumped off to a
quick 1-0 lead in the ﬁrst inning. the
Albany offense scored four runs iri
each of the’i‘rrst two innings. to lead
B-l. The big blows of the innings
were a bases clearing triple by
centerﬁeider Mark McDonald in
the first and a run scoring dorrble by
Willie Guerra in the 2nd.

Dartmouth closed the gap in
awesome fashion in the ﬁfth. After
loading the bases. lst baseman Tim
Wall smacked a grand slam on a 1-!
pitch. Albany scored a run in their
half of the fifth and after a scoreless
sixth Albany led. 9-6.

Jim Vauhn, who pitched well for
three innings after relieving starting
pitcher Jim Demitrou. was reached
for three runs in the top of the
seventh before Rich Dwycr retired
the side. The stage was now set for a
little Albany magic.

Pete Stiito led off with a walk
and was sacrificed to second by Joe
chkel. Dartmouth intentionally
walked Valoszr to set up a double
play possibility. it almost worked as
Guerra hit a sharp grounder to the
third baseman. who stepped on
third for the force but threw wildly
to first. advancing runners to se-
cond and third. Ronnie Massaroni
was intentionally passed to set up a
force at any base. The move
backfired as the batter was .lerry
Rosen. the leading batter on the
Dane squad. hitting well over .500.
He lined a l-l pitch over the center-
l'telders head to give Albany a |0-9

Albany was sporting a modest
two game winning streak after the
win. Brit that streak did not reach
three, as Dartrriouth came back to
heat Albany 12-4.

Mike Gartnian started the 2nd

game for Aibtriiy brrt just didn't
have it as he was reached for six
runs in 3 and 2/3rds innings of
work. Dwycr relieved him but ran
out of gas in the sixth as Dartmouth
scored six rtiorc times to put the
game out of reach.

offensively the Danes hit two
homers in the game. Kcn (ilirssrriiiti
has a solo shot in the first and Ron
Massaroni had a two rrrn clout in
the fifth.

So far the story with the Jack
Siedlecki coached .lV team has been
errors. Too many of them. in the
field the Danes were shaky. as they
committed numerous nilscu 's in
their early losses to Hudson Valley
and Cobleskill. They played well in
another loss to West point.

Offensively. the Danes are set as
they average seven runs a game.

Rhenish remained very satisﬁed
with her team’s brand of play.
“The team gets along well together
and that's important." said
Rhenish.

Concerning her team's sluggish
defensive exhibition. Rhenish add-
ed. “We hadn’t played since Satur-
day. but things always look better
when you win."

way through the game. But. the se-
cond game was more of a battle as
Albany was tied with Sage at 11
runs apiece in the fifth before
breaking it open with six more to
win the game.

Rhenish commented on the twin
victories over Russell Sage. “We ex-
pected them to be stronger, but we
hit real well."

Boasting a 9-3 record and a high
seed in the upcoming state tourna-
ment to be held this weekend in
Albany. Rhenish is very optimistic
about her team’s chances. “This is
the best team l’ve coached since
l've been coaching here. We've met
our goal of making it to the state
tournament. We're in good shape,
and 1 am looking for us to do real
well," said Rhenish.

loss to Middlebury yesterday at Alhitny. (Photo: llob Leonard)

by Paul Schwartz

For a team that is battling to keep
their heads above water. it was not
the most encouraging of efforts.
Considering that Middlebury came
into yesterday's game posting a 2-6
record. it seemed to be an excellent
opportrrnity for the Albany State
baseball team to finally crack the
standard mark ofa quality squad —
a winning record.

But at tile conclusion of yester-
day's contest at Albany, that wintr-
ing record was even more elusive
titan ever. The Danes dropped a 7-4
decision to the Panthers of Mid—
dlebury. a loss that pushed
Albany‘s spring record down to 6-7.

Despite being out-hit 9-8. Mid-
dlebury did enough damage early in
the game to quickly chase Dane
starting pitcher Mike (.‘Iabcaux.
After picking up one run in the first
inning (on it wtrlk. stolen base. and
single to left). the l’atitlicrs explori-
cd for five big runs in the third.
Tilill ()stler led off with an iril'icld
single. .lirrr Loveys was hit by a
pitch. and Pcrc Price singled to load
the bases. A slrokc into left by Ed

(iuirtlicr brought across Mid—
dlcbirry‘s second run.

slam -— a towering drive that car-
ried over the fence in left center-
i'rcld. providing the Panthers with a
6-0 lead and also providing
Clabeaux with an early exit. as
reliever Rich Woods came on to
retire the side.

“it was a high fastball." said
Harrison of his round-tripper.
“Most places we play in don't have
fences — i hit it well. but i think it
rnigbt have been caught if there was
no fence. it‘s funny. i thought he
(Clabeaux) was good. He threw
harder than the other guy‘ they
brought in. birt i couldn‘t touch the
second guy."

Not only did Harrison have pro-
blems with Woods. but his Mid-
dlebury teammates also had dif-
ficulty with Woods and his side—
windirrg delivery. Keeping the ball
low in the strike zone. Woods
allowed the Panthers just one run
(in the fourth) and only four hits iri
his seven innings.

But if Middlebury was quiet at
the plate, the Danes were close to
silent. 'i‘lic usually potent Albimy
buts could iroi get unlrtrcked against
Panther ltirrlcr Bob Gallo. as iltc
rightlrander kept the Danes off
balance with a sharp-breaking
curvcbail. And when Albany did
rtiariagc to get something going. the

outcome was nothing but frustra-
tion. in the second inning, Bob Ar-
cario became Albany's first
baserunner with a line single. Rich
Cardilio followed with a long dou-
ble to center. but Arcario was forc-
ed to delay on the bases because the
centerlielder came close to corraling
the drive. When the ball dropped,
Arcario went from ﬁrst to third,
and with Albany coach Rick Skeei
waving him on. Areario came
charging to the plate, only to be
thrown out to stiﬂe the scoring
chance.

There was more frustration for
the Danes. In the third. a slow roller
by designated hitter Tony
Moschella and two walks loaded the
bases for Albany with one out.
Bruce Rowlands then hit a hard

grounder tip the middle — right at '

the waiting Middlebury shortstop.
who turned art inning-ending dou-
ble play. '

The Danes fiiialiy broke through
off Gallo in the eighth. when Jim
Lynch led off with a hard single to
left. After it ficlders' choice sent
pinch rirrincr Mike Esposiio to se-
cond. Cardillo's grounder to sliorl
forced an Albany running mistake.
Esposilo attempted to advance on
the play. btri was easily tugged out

The Albany State men‘s tennis
team capped off a rough week with
a 7-2 victory over a weak RPl Icarir

loss to Division 1 Colgate on Mon-
day. a rare defeat in the SUNY

weekend. and a loss to Amherst last
Thursday.

Tuesday's win at RP] was ex-
pccted because. as Albany men's
tennis coach Bob Lewis said, “Rl’l
is just not a good team. We didn’t
play particularly well. but we knew
they weren't really that good so we
gava a lot of guys a chance to
play,”

Lewis shook-up his lineup for the
match, with Larry Linett, Randy

Young. and Andy Diamond sitting

fourth singles. 6-2. 6—2. as did
Avcrgurr in the fifth slot, 7-6. 6-4.
Albany's slim 3-2 lead appeared to
bc in jeopardy as Steve Kaplan
squared off against RPl's .lorr Wit-
ter in his “first—ever match" for
Albany. but be staged an impressive
two sci win. 6-0. 6-1. to carry the
lead into doubles.

Albany then put the icing on the
cake, sweeping the doubles C0ll'l-
petition with only one tearri that
had ever played together before.
Eiclicn rtiid Levine teamed up for
the first time in first dotrblcs and
easily defeated RPl’s top tearrr. 6-2.
6-1. The Laurilliard-Avergun corri-
bintrtion played as well lit second
doubles as they usually do in the
more familiar third slot. outclassing
Ri’l. 6-1. 6-4. The learn of Lerner
and Kapltin found the right formula
in their debut performance to finish
out the day. 6-2. 6-1.

“We played adequately." Lewis
concluded. "We played them in the
fall and beat them, 8-1. We knew
their strengths iii advance and we
were ready for them."

in Monday's match the Danes
were outclassed by Division I
powerhouse Colgittc. The match

was played indoors because of the
weather and was mercifully stopped
after singles when Colgate clinched
it. 5-].

“Colgate has one of the best
teams in the east," noted Lewis.
“We have never beaten a Colgate
team." Tbe'only win for Albany
came in ﬁrst singles when Linett
pulled 0111 a hard-fought three set
victory over Chris Winkle. Winkle
edged bini in the first set, 6-7. but
Linett battled back to win the next
two. 6-3, 6-2. "it was a very good
win for Linett." said Lewis.

in second singles Levine put on a
good show for three sets. btit came
away oti the short side of the 6-7.
6-2. 6-4 score. “Levine played well
for us." Lewis noted. "But the rest
of the team was beaten by better
players. Colgate has an excellent
team."

The SUNY Center Tournament
was lieid last weekend in Buffalo
and for the first time iii three years
Albany didn't win it. This year
Binglianitort walked away with the
crown with 14 points. Albany plac-
ed sceorid with 11 points, and Buf-
falo’s presence was not obvious
with orin two points.

Linen and Levine excelled for
Albany, each winning both of their
matches. Linett upstaged Binglram-
tori’s top mart. Mark Lifschiiz. in a
very strong effort. 8-2 (pro set). He
was equally as impressive in his 8-6
victory over Buffalo‘s Todd Miller.
the runner up in the SUNYACs last
fall. Levine won two hard fought
matches against Binghamton's Neil
Rolier. 8-6, and Bill Kaiser of Buf-
falo, 8-5.

. The rest of the ladder fared well
against Buffalo. but couldn't
muster up a win against a well
balanced Binghamton squad.
Young, Diamond. Lerner. and
Avergurr all split their two matches.

The only major upset of note
came in the Albany-Binghamton
first doubles match. Lifschitz and
Rolier avenged their earlier losses to
Linett and Levirtc by upsetting them
in a tiebreakcr in what Lewis said
was "a very good doubles match."

Lewis felt that the absence of
Albany‘s number three man.
Lawrence Eichcn, could have been
a deciding factor. “if Eiclreri was
there we could have won.” he said.
“We were right iii it rip until the end
— it was a real dogfight. We really
played very well. If Eicbcn was
there it probably would have been
decided by one point eiilrer way."

Eicben's absence also hurt
Albany last Thursday when iliey fell
to Amherst. 7—2. “We were really
litrrt without having Eicheri in
there." said Lewis. “1 think we
would have beaten them if lie was
there." The effect of losing a player
high on the ladder is not limited to
just one match. Wlicn Eichcrr. the
third rnair on the ladder. is out. four
players have to move up and face
stiffer competition than they would
normally have been up against.

This ci'lcct becomes obvious
when you look at the results.
Although Linett was upset in first
singles. Levine won in the second
spot. but none of the players who
had been forced to move ttp’a notch
could come up with a victory. The
only other Albany win against
Arnlrcrsi crime in first doubles with
Linett and Levine teaming up to
take it.
