‘ Inconsistent, 4-95 Stickmen Look For Answers

by Jay Glssen

if a single word can describe it,‘

it's inconsistency. If there's a look
that says it all, snap a picture of
coach Motta. if you’re looking for
a sentence, then Mark Waterstram

' said it best: “Just about everything
is going wrong."

Well, almost everything. The
Albany State lacrosse team lost
badly yesterday, but they did grab a
triple overtime victory on Tuesday
afternoon. bringing their current

record to 4-5. But despite the
scores, despite the standings,
despite talent, youth, and ex-

periencc. despite everything except
reality, the'Dancs have been playing
poor lacrosse lately. and no one we
actly knows why.

it was a mediocre Hariwick

squad that came all too close to vic-
tory on Tuesday. seitdiitg what
should have been a fairly easy
Albatiy witi iirto a tension-filled. tri-
ple overtime close call, as Richie
Heimerle firtally liad etiotrglt and
put iii tlte winning strddetr dcalh
goal unassisted. The final score was
8-7 but it cotild have easily beeti the
other way around, and the Danes
know it.

“We should have done much bet—
ter against Hartwick," said mid~
fielder Glen Magrtme. “they just
weren‘t tha_t good. We played down
to their level."

Maybe so, but Albany outslrot
Hartwick (41-24). ltad ntorc
groundballs (52-36). and cleared
better. But despite that, the Danes
just couldn‘t keep possession of the
ball that nruclt. and a 40 percent

face-off success added to the dilem-
ma. —

Said Heimerle. "We were hurt
bad on the face-offs. We were los-
ing sixty percent of them, so we just
didn't have the ball."

And when they did have it, they
weren't quick enough, so they
couldn’t generate any fast breaks.
any 'quickly set up sirots, few goals.
By the time the shots came. a stable
Hartwick defense was set up, and
Albany becarrrc the victim of 20
Hartwick saves as compared to
their own nine.

Yesterday, similar offensive [H'Or
blerrrs stopped an already hurting
Albany squad dead itr its slow mov-
ing path. Sierra (7-2) marched
brazenly onto the Dutch Quad
field. moved quick. passed well.
and met with a listless Albany
defense that gave up 15 goals to
Albany‘s six. All arouttd, it was
probably Albany’s worst effort all
scitsott.‘

Albany handled the groundbrtlls
adequately. but Sierra picked up a
lot more. Sierra got off a lot nrore
shots. though. especially iir that
fateful fottttir quarter when they

outscored the Danes S-l. Arid even
tliotrglt the face-offs were more

even than against Hartwick, the

Danes were shaky with the ball.
“We‘re not settling down when
we get the ball," rcrrrarkcd
Heimerle, who came up with two
goals atrd an assist. “We‘re giviirg
tip too many fast breaks and we‘re
trot able to get many. There’s a
general lack of hustle, a lack of
thinking. They just weren‘t that

much better than us. There was no
reason to get blown off the field."

Perhaps not. but that’s the way
the Dane cookie crumbled. and
Motta has exactly a day to put it
back together again, when Albany
plays Brockport tomorrow in what
should be a fairly easy victory if
there are sorrre positive changes in
outlook and fornt.

For example, in yesterday’s
game, Albany not only didn't take
advantage of tire man-ups they had.
btrt they gave up goals instead.
With an extra player on the field
dtrririg opposition penalties ——
usually the fast break time for any
offense — Albany was just as slug-
gish as ever, and Sierra, responding
to their disadvantage with vigor and
quickness. turned it around attd
came up with several man-down
scores.

Said team captain Heimerle.-
“()ur titan-up is iiurtittg us ntorc
than it’s heipingrus. We gave up
fottr man-up goals and that's
ridiculous. Sooner or later. ottr
rttzur~up plays have to work."

Dcfcnsivcly. the vigor that seein-
ed so proririsirrg iir the early part of
the season seems to be fallittg apart
these days as Albany is becoming
easy prey to tltc fast breaks of their
faster, more responsive opponents.
Sierra opened up yesterday's game
with a spurt of fottr ttitariswercd
first quarter goals. and pegged two
rrrore in the second qrtarter before
Albany was able to put one in.

Said dcfcuseman Vic Errranuello,
“When a team gets ahead 6-0,
there‘s something wrong. We gave

up sortie garbage goals and we
didn’t play very well."

Heimerle thinks differently. "I
don't consider it a defensive pro-
blem. The wltolc team‘s got to settle
itself down."

And that's wlterc the inconsisten-
cy problem enters in. On the
groundballs. what Motta called the
key problem last week, there was

improvement. But the defense
plummeted. In the goalie‘s net, Kcn
Tirman has been coming tip with
sonic clutch saves. But the offense
died. in the penalty situation,
Albany has gotten less than any op-
ponent this year. But the man-ups
ltave been doing virtually nothing.
So what is a coach to do? How

Trackmen Go To SUNYACS With Win Over Union

 

 

 

 

On Tuesday, the Albany State men's track team defeated Union. 103-51, In
I duel meet at the Danett' home field. (Photo: Mark Halelt)

by Bob llelliiflore

Tire rains went to Williams, so
Albany and Union came to Univer-
sity Field. Dowupours Monday
night forced the shift froirt the
scheduled triangular meet between
those schools at Williams to a dual-
mcet confrontation of the two
Capital District rivals. it wasn't
much of a confrontation, though,
as the Danes literally ran all over the
Dutchmen, winning 103-51. The
meet was the last dual-meet of the
season for Albany, who at 5-4. now
go into the SUNYAC champion-
ships at Brockport.

“Really all we were doing was
getting the irtcct itr arid getting them
(the learn) some work." cont-
mentcd Albany head track and field
coach Bob Munsey. feeling that the
meet was basically a tune-up for
iUll'lUfl’UW.

Munscy was upset over tltc fact
that Williams, whose dirt and
cinder three lap—to-the-mile track
was unusable dtie to tltc raitr,
cancelled ottt of the tricct. "i prayed
for rain because l just didn't want
to run there,” said Mtrrisey. "l’m
glad we didn‘t run there." The
coach also didn't appreciate the fact
that Union left some of their top
runners home. “Union was not
represented as they should have
been." 'continued Mrrrrsey, noting
that _ the Dutchmen held back
several men that would have meant.
according to Munsey. about 32
points, which wouldn't have won
the meet for Union, but "would've
made it closer."

The Danes truly dominated their

 

opponents. winning 13 of the 18
events. Of the five that Albany lost,
three were field events. Union's
Brad Kilne took the hammer throw
(119 feet, 10 inches), but Dane Al
llokser was second (108 feel. one
inch). The Dutchmen took the top
two spots in both the pole vault and
the shot put, with Albany men Patti
Eichclberger and Don Cordell get-
ting thirds. respectively.

The other two Union wins came
in the 5000 meter run (where Ed Ar-
nlreitcr was first in 15:33.4. 15.6
seconds faster than Dane Todd
Silva). and in the 400 meter dash. 1n
the latter. Matt Guilfoylc’s time of
50.9 seconds (a track record) was
just cnonglr to beat Albany's Curt
Denton (51.2 seconds) and Tony
Ferretti (51.5 seconds).

The two relay races were taken by
Albany combinations. Bill McCar-
llll. Ferrctti, .lcff Knight, and
llowic Williams ptit together a lirtrc
of 44.8 seconds iii the 400 meter
relay to take that one, wirilc the
quarth of Jim Cunningham, Steve
lirh. Ferrctti. and Detrton won the
mile relay in three minutes, 28
seconds.

Williams worr both.the 100 and
200 meter dashes, in" ll'.03 seconds
and 22.3 seconds. respectively.
Albany swept all three scoritrg spots
in those races.

The 110 meter high hurdles saw
Dane Mitch Harvard win in 16.3
seconds, with Cunningham getting
second. A 57.8 second time by Critt-
nlngham in the 400 meter in-
termediate hurdles was good
enough to beat teammate Pete

l’assidonio (61.3 seconds).

Two more track records fell to
Albany runners. Scott James broke
the old mark in the 1500 meter run
with his time of four ntinutes. ﬁve
seconds. Bruce Shapiro broke the
tape of the 800 meter run in one
minute. 58.2 seconds, also putting
him in the record books.

Field events weren’t a
catastrophe for the Danes for once.
as they won five of eight. Bill Con-
dort took the long jump with a leap
of 5.87 meters (19 feet, 3‘/t inches).
He also won the triple jump (12.46
meters —— 40 feet. 10% inches). lit
the javclirr throw. Graditi Avery's
fling of47.47 meters (155 feet. eight
inches) took first. Avery was also
third in the lortg jump. Cordell won
the discus cvertt. hurling it 35.8]
meters (123 feet, fottr inches), aitd
in the high jump. lllL‘ Albany duo of
Ned Miller and Tim Gunther tied
for the lead at five feet, eight in-
clrcs. btrl Miller had less misses at
that height and was awarded first
place.

Looking to this Weekend's
SUNYAC championships, Mtrnsey
feels that the ever-present problem
of lack of weight rtreit will be
magnified. aitd will squelch any
hopes for an Albany victory.
Thinking back to the season’s
beginning, Mttnscy noted that “1
really thought we were going to
haw: some help" in the weight
category. and was pointing for a se-
cond or third place finish in the
SUNYAC. But now. his attitude
has changed. “l'd be very happy to

Feud Over Election Methods

 

Causes Tabulation Delays

by Susan Mlllignn

A “lack of communication" bet-
ween SA President Lisa Newmark
and Election Commissioner Ron
Joseph resulted in a feud involving
strong language, punches thrown.
and job threats. according to
Joseph. .

Newmark and Joseph were in ap-
parent disagreement regarding the
relaying of election results. Joseph
planned to announce all of the win-
ners iii a "press conference" in the
Fireside Lounge at 10:30 p.m.
Wednesday. Newmark wanted to
have the results posted in the SA
Office as the individual quad
returns were reported.

"l've been a candidate and 1
know what (election night) is like.”
said Newmark. “it can really hurt a
candidate's feelings if he or she
finds out in public that he or she
lost."

According to Joseph, Newmark's
plan. which has been standard pro-
cedure in tire past, would create
chaos.

"i didn't intend to post the
results arid say “everybody
charge," Joseph said.

Section Vl-C of SA's Election
Regulations charter states “...tbe
commission will post in tire Campus
Center as soon as possible after vote
tabulations the results of elec»
tions." However. Joseph noted the
rules “did not say 1 couldn‘t hold a
press conference."

According to Newmark. it was
clear on Wednesday afternoon that
the returns procedure would be
handled traditionally. "i had made
a decision," said Newmark. “1
think since i appointed Ron as
Commissioner. 1 have jurisdiction
over hint. We discussed it in the
afternoon, and he walked away. I
assumed we were doing it the way 1
wished."

Joseph also assumed his plan was
to be implemented. "1 saw
(Newmark) Wednesday,” he said.
“and she said 'How are we going to
do this?‘ i told ltcr l was going
through with (my plait), and site hit

The apparent nature of the
misunderstanding surfaced
Wednesday evening at Joseph's
suite. the site of the ballot tabula-
tions. According to Joseph,
Newmark. SA ntcnrbcrs Mike
Williamrion. and .lirrr Mitchell arriv-
ed at his suite around 10 p.m.
“kicking the door. yelling. and
demanding to come in." Although
Newmark is technically a member

Senate Elections May Be Invalid

by Eric Koll

Due to a possible violation of
election proccdttrcs by the SA Cen-
tral Council, this week’s University
Senate elections may be invalidated.

Tire alledgcd violations were the
result of SA Central Council's deci-
sion which prohibited students
without tax cards front voting for
University Senators.

This dccisiort was in direct viola-
tion of clectiort regulations which
allow all students to vote for
University Senators whether or not
tltcy have a tax card.

According to University Senators
and Central Council members, the
only way the regulations could be
changed is if a specific bill regarding
the University Senate Election Pro-
cedures is passed by a 2/3 vote in
the Ccntral Council. according to
Senate members Mark Borkowski,
lrtr Soriracli, trird Mark Lal‘aycttc.

However, no such bill was ever
introduced irtto the Central Coun-
cil. voted ttporr. or passed.- accor—
ding to Central Cotiiicil members
Frank Baitrnan, 13d Klein. and
Marl: Lafayette.

“if a bill did not pass their it was
illegal to prevent it person without a
tax card to vote for the Senate."
said Senate member Borkowski,
who is SA’s former Legislative
Coordinator.

“To my knowledge it was never

passed. We haven't passed arrythiitg
like it since 1 was there.” said Bait-
man.

“As far as 1 know there were no
bills regarding University Senate
voting proccdttrc ever brought tip.“
said Klein.

Both Buitnran arid Klein claim
that they've attended every Central
Council urectirig irt which election
proccdurcs were discussed.

Central Council decided to let tiri-
ly students witli tax cards vote so
that they would have a control
system. Tire tax cards were ptriicltcd
on the voting line to prevent
students front voting twice, accor-
ding to Central Council Chair Mike
chy arid SA Elections (.‘omtiris-
sioncr Ron-Joseph.

"Foremost iii cvcryoire’s trriitd

would work,“ said levy who felt
that using tax cards was the only
“foolproof control."

Levy said that SA had the
authority to change the election
procedure and require all voters to
have tax cards “if that was the only
tricaiis of control available.”

Levy, who was contacted before
the University Senate and Courteil
members were reached, was unable
to be contacted in response to their
statements.
