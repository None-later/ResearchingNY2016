Congress to Restrict Nukes

WASHINGTON (AP) House-Senate conferees reached
agreement late Thursday on a compromise bill setting new
licensing standards for nuclear power plants and raising by
tenfold the penalties for the violation of safety rules. The
legislation, prompted by the Three Mile Island accident 13
months ago, now goes back to both chambers for final ap-
proval. Under the measure. the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission would have to certify the adequacy of state
emergency evacuation plans before licensing new nuclear
power plants. This was a compromise between a Senate-
passed bill, ﬂatly prohibiting nuclear plants in the absence
of state evacuation plans, and a House bill without any
such restrictions. The legislation would also: (1) Raise civil
penalties from $5,000 to $100,000 for eaclt violation of art
NRC order and make it a federal crime to violate NRC
orders and regulations during the cortstructiott of a nuclear
plant. (2) Require the NRC to consider the possibility of a
reactor core meltdown when deciding how faraway front a
town or city a plant can be safely located. (3) Add 146 new
resident inspectors to the NRC's program. (4) Require tlte
NRC to notify governors when nuclear shipments are to be
transported through their states. (5) Direct the NRC to
isstte new standards for state emergency plans that take into
account the Three Mile Island experience. The new rttlc for
nuclear plattts is part of a hill tIllllIOrlllllg programs for the
NRC for the rctttaitttlcr of fiscal 1980. wlticlt crtds ttcxl
Sept. 30. It contains far fewer restrictions than rtuclear
critics irt Congress originally had hoped. Earlier attetnpls itt
botlt the House and Senate to attach a moratoriunt on ttew
plant constructiort to the bill were rejected by wide margins.

Col. Cancels Rescue Attempt

WASHINGTON (AP) Col. Charles Beckwith. the tough-
talking Army commando leader, said Thursday he
unhesltatingly recommended cancellation of last week’s
hostage rescue raid in Iran because the breakdown of three
.helicopters made it too risky. Surfacing for the first time
since the mission was scrubbed, Beckwith made clear he
had no doubts that his recommendation was correct.
although he obviously was disappointed that long months
of preparation were wasted. The 51-year-old commander of
the 90-man Army-Marine commando strike force bristled
when asked about reports he wanted to proceed with the
mission even though he had only five usable helicopters,
one below what planners had fixed as a safe minimum.
“I'm not about to be a party to a half-assed leading of a
bunclt of aircraft and going up and murdering a bunclt of
fine soldiers." Beckwith told Pentagon reporters. “l'm ttot
that kind of a man."

Arabs Free British Hostage

LONDON (AP) Arab gunmen holding the Iranian Etn-
bassy in London freed one of their British hostages today
and let two death dcadlirtes pass for their dozen or ntore
Iranian captives. They gave no immediate indication of
their next step in the tense showdown with Ayatollah
Rultollalt Kl‘tonteitti's regime. The three Arab-lranians had
threatened to blow up the crttbassy, thetttsclvcs, attd tltc lra—
niatt hostages unless lratt freed 91 Arabs imprisoned itt
Khuzcsittn. Iran's oil province on the lraqi border, by ttoott
today h 7:00 a.m. EDT. The gunmen ltave protttised ttot to
harm non-lraniatt hostages. At least three non-lranians
were reported arttottg the total of 19 hostages. '

The tltetttc of the program, “Outstattdittg Acndemit

Students, Ticket Thyselvos

The SUNYA Security Department is considering a plat
for this fall to involve students itt issuing parking tickets on
campus.

Assistant Security Director Joint Hettighan said that a
plan is being considered which would allow work stttdy pt o-
gram students to help SUNYA Police issue parking tickets.
According to Henighan, this would provide added flexibili-
ty in assigning regular officers around campus.

Henigltan pointed out that the City of Albany L'Illploys
tnetcr trtaids to enforce parking regulations, freeing police
officers for other duties. The system is also used on a
nttntbcr of other campuses.

When asked about tltc potential cotttplicaiiotls with

that there would be a “conﬂict ofinterest" among Silltlctth

amounting to approximately
5750-800, said Siegel.

dards (which were mounted on the
inﬁeld portion of the University
Field) had been bent out of shape
and that the goals and nets (located
on the practice ﬁelds just southeast
of University Gym) were totally
destroyed.

Siege-1 noted that the eight-year
old goals cost approximately $125

repaired. He also stated that the
standards, pttrchttsed 11 years ago
would cost somewhere in the vicini-

SUN YA Praised for Access

Disabled Have Good Accommodations

by Leah Kraklnowski

SUNYA has been named a
“model for access" for the disabled
in a rccettt report submitted to the
Higher Education Committee by
Assemblyman Mark Siegel.

According to the report. SUNYA
is one of two SUNY schools in tltc
SUNY system that meets full com<
pliance with Section
504-Rehahi1hion Act of 1973 which
states tltttt “no otherwise qttalificd
disabled individual shall, solely by
reason of his disttbility, be excluded
frotn participation itt. be dcttied
benefits of. or be subjected to
discrimination ttttder any ttctivity
receiving federal financial
assistance."

An inqttiry ittto the status of ne-
cessibility for tltc disabled revealed
that 26 out of the 28 SUNY colleges
have failed to contan with the

 

federal regulations of Section 504.
and will be itt violation as of .lutte 1,
1980. Only SUNY Bittghamton attd
SUNY Albany have fulfilled 504 re~
quircmcnts.

A self-evaluation of accessibility
on campus shows that SUNYA has
been working towards botlt ar-
chitectural and academic ac-
cessibility as far back as May 1965.
Major architectural modifications
sttelt as access ramps to nearly all
buildings on the ttptowrt campus
attd living accommodations for the
disabled on State Quad which in-
cludc elevators to the dirting rootn
and bathroom/shower facilities
have been fttlly completed and are
working effectively to provide ac-
cessibility to those disabled
students.

In order to ensure continued int-

provements of implementation of

Section 504. a university-wide task
force. the 504 Concerns Commit-
tee, was cstablislted tltree years ago.
Tltis cottttttittec, co-chaircd by Bill
Roth attd Gloria DeSolc of Affir-
mative Action, is a tttulti-faceted
organization that acts as a liason
between its disabled students and
the university wltilc providing facul-
ty education for the handicapped as
well as corttirtttous self-evaluation
of its accessibility.

The report released by the Com-
mittee on Iliglter Education corn-
ntcttds Albany's successful efforts
towards complete accessibility for
the disabled, stressing the impor-
tattce of SUNYA as a model for
other SUNY campuses to emulate.
As 504 Concerns Committee co-
cltair Iiill Roth stressed, “what

isting accounts. The credit union
will be open for two hours at the
beginning of eaclt of the scvett
orictttatiort sessions." according to
board member Andy Skttrowitz.
“ltttcrest rates on all accounts are
bcittg increased as of May 1.”
Schilling said. "Basically. the credit
union‘s funds are invested irt three-
tttotttlt U.S. treasury securities.
Over the past year, interest rates
paid on tltesc ltavc risen dramatical—
ly from 12 percent to about 15 or 16
percent," he said. “We‘rcjust pass-
ing the ittcrcasc on to our
depositors. With the ltigltcr interest
rates the credit uniott pays;
depositors can eartt tttore rttoncy
than lit a savings or commercial
bank," he said.

According to Skttrowitz. “The
credit ttttiott has upped interest rates
1/2 pcrccttt across tltc board. The
new rates are as follows: 6 percent
on accounts of less than $5(X), 6 1/4

 

 

percent on accounts of 3500-999.
attd (t 3/4 percent on accounts of
more than $1000."

Schilling explained, “The reason
the credit ttttiott can give tttorc than
6 percent interest is that it's ttot
govcrrted by the satttc regulations as
comntcricial arid savings banks.
They give a tttaxittuntt of 5.5 per-
cent per year on regular passbook
accounts. liy law, the credit urtion is
allowed to give a maximum of 12
percent."

"We hope to be able to open stu-
dcttl cltecking accounts in the near
future," Skurowitz said. “As tnore
people open up credit ttttiott ac-
cottttls and our '. ts build," this
will becottte feasible. ltc said.

To facilitate tttorc efficient corn-
ptttation of balances and interest.
“tltc credit ttttiott is going 'on a com-
puterization system." Schilling
said. “Right now. all figures are
