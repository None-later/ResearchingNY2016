Candidate Name Mix- Up In SA Election

by Susan Mllllgnn

Problems with SA voting
machines contirtued this week as
one candidate received conﬂicting
reports on his victory. artd another
candidate was left off the ballot cn-
tirely.

Off-Campus Urtivcrsity Senate
candidate Gary Silverrnan was in-
formcd Wednesday night he had
won a seat irt Uttivetsity Senate.
However. when he looked at the of~
ficial winning cartdidatcs posted ill

the SA ofﬁce. he didn‘t see his
name written.

“I was a little surprised." said
Silverman. “I went into the SA of-
fice Thursday all confident that I
had won. and I saw that maybe i
hadn't."

Election Commissioner Ron
Joseph said that “there was a
mistake (itt name transferral) and
Silverntart is a winner."

The winning names were up»
parcntly ntiscopicd from Joseph's

Newnmrk-Joseph Election Feud

continued from front page

Joseph refused to let ltcr in because
“she was actively supporting 21
presidential candidate."

Assistant Contmissiortcr Sn/ttrtnc
Koren claintcd Ncwrttark angrily
yelled. “I'rtt l'---irtg SA President,
you've got to let rttc in; I'm on the
contrttission. let me irt —- yott gtrys
won't get paid.‘

Ncwntark admitted she was
“annoyed arid upset at the way
(she) was treated." btrt denied
shouting obsccttilics.

“I had it rigltl to bc irt there."
said Ncwntark. "I was expecting a
call at about 8 pm. givirtg some
election results. artd I didn‘t get
orte. I was there (at Joseph's)
bccauscl wanted to know what was
goirtg on procedurally. The election
was still my responsibility."

Joseph said Newmark “just
wanted to be thcrc...to firtd out the
results."

Eventually. Assistant Commis-
siortcr Mickey Tarpittian. feeling
that Ncwmark and Mitchell were
“creating a disturbance” and
hindering the ballot~counting. call-
cd Dutch Quad dorm director Pat
Dowse. At this point. Tarpinian
said. Williamson had left.

“I checked out the disturbance
call. and was greeted by Lisa and
some other guy screaming.” said
Dowsc. “Lisa was saying ‘You’re
not doing this tltc rigltt way...l have
to talk to you...You're going to be
fired -— I’m rtot going to pay you.’
Eventually. I quieted them down
and told Lisa site probably wasn’t
going to get in."

Tarpinian said that Newmark
then attempted to ettter tltc suite
while a resident of tltc suite walked
irt. ’l‘arpinian said when he moved
to stop her. Newrnark began pun-
clting ltitn in the cltest. Dowse con—
firmed Tarpinian‘s statement.

“I wanted to know wltat was go:
ing on,"Dowse said. “I thought
maybe she had a rigltt to be upset. I
talked to Ron. who said he had to
finish the ballot counting. Ron said
to Lisa. 'Don't you want a fair elec-
tiott'!‘ and site said. ‘No. I want to
have it my wuy."'

Tarpiniatt cortfirrttcd this, adding
that he then asked. “You mean you
don't want a fair election?” Tarpi-
rtian said Mitchell's response was
“there's rttorc than ortc way to have
a fair clcctiort."

Ncwmurk fccls she was treated
badly as SA President and was
angry tltnt she was "dcnicd her
rights as a mctttbcr ol' the commis—
sion."

“All I wanted was to have it done
tltc way it was done in tire past w I
didn't want to see lltc results," she
said.

Mitchell, a candidate and ttot a
member of the commission. said he
went to Joseph's suite becttusc ltc
“didn't want Lisa to walk over
alone." Mitchell said he rrtndc no
attempt to enter the roortt WllCl‘C lltc
ballots were. but feels Newmttrk

should have been allowed ittsidc.

“Slit knocked for IS rnittutcs and
tltcy wouldn‘t let her irt...shc got
progressively louder. But I don't
blame her (for her behavior) it
damn bit. I thought it was
disgusting iltc way Ron was treating
her. llc doesn't ntakc policy. he
follows it." Mitchell said.

Snort after Dowse lcft lltc scene.
SA candidates Craig Weirtstock and
Ira Sornach arrived. When inform-
cd of tltc situation. neither tricd to
gain cntrancc. Joscph said.

Eventually. Wcirtstock. Mitchell.
Ncwmttrk. and Joseph cortfcrrcd itt
Joseph‘s sttitcroom. during which
tirttc tltc ballots wcrc lockcd in other
roortts. I'Ic conceded to calling iii to
the SA Office the presidential
rcstrlts. Jcscplt posted tltc rest of
the results in the SA Office and in—
formed a waiting crowd of about
200 in the Fireside Lounge of the
site of the election returns. Tltc
result. Joseph said, was a starnpcdc
toward the office.

Both Joseph and Ncwnturk
stressed that no ttttnpcring of votes
or ballots occurred.

Joseph is angry at Newmark and
apologetic to those who waited
nearly an extra hour for tltc election

. results. he said.

According to Weinstock.
Newmark “was not being
unreasonable."

"The SA President has always
worked as a messenger of the
results. Lisa had every right to be irt
that room."

Somach said he feels “there were
better ways to deal with the situa-
tion than the way Lisa handled
it...most people would probably
agree with Ron."

Somach added that “SA elec-
tions have not been the fairest in the
past. Lisa wanted to make it fair,
and Ron wanted to make it fair.
Both people went to extremes.”

list to the SA list. Joseph said all
person involved with the mix-up
ltave been notified of their actual
states.

“I don‘t know who ntade the
mistake and it doesn't ntatrer."said
Joscplt. “It was an honest
mistake.“

A mistake was also ntadc itt the
omission of Jim Castro-Blanco's
rtatrtc in the Campus Center
rttacltirtc University Council.
Joseph noticed tltc discrepancy

after voting was completed. Joseph
said he added the votes of the other
candidates front the Campus Center
machine and found that if they were
awarded to Castro-Blanco. ltc could
have conceivably won the election.
Joseph said he and Assistant
Commissioners present when the
mistake was discovered voted to call
Castro-Blanca and offer him a re-
vote for Uttivcrsity Council.
Castro-Blanco. however.
“graciously refused." Joseph said.

"I wasn’t going to contest an
election in which I only won 52
votes.” said Castro-Blanco.

The reason for the mishap is
unknown. but Castro-Blanco seems
to feel there were underlying per—
sonal factors involved.

“Kort (Joseph) told me Lisa
(Newmark) was the one who wrote
the names on the Campus Center
machine." said Castro-Blanca.
"My name was left off. You Figure
it out."

The tax cards were used as a control
because there were “no other viable
alternatives" according to Joseph.
Since all full-time students were
issued tax cards. Joseph felt that
this was a fair system.

Furlong said. "It is nationally
chartered and governed by the
