New Zukes

Now that “fast food" items have
grown from a simple burger and
fries to onion rings. chicken. pies.
corn on the cob, fried mushrooms.
eggs and sausages and steak and
fish sandwiches, yet another exotic
food is on the test market agenda:
zucchini.

Nation '5 Restaurant News
reports that several McDonald’s
outlets near the Oak Brook
(iiiinois) area are experimenting
with deep-fried zucchini as a side
dish.

The 3-ounce portions of fried
zucchini have been on the menu on
Ronald's home turf near the super-
chain’s world headquarters for
about three months.

The “McZukes” go for a test
market price of 85 cents.

Something to Hide?

Publication of a book about the
Central intelligence Agency's in-
volvement in the Middle East dur-
ing the 1950's has been delayed
after the C.i.A. insisted on review-
ing portions of and possibly even
censoring the book.

The book. which was scheduled
for release next month, is titled
Ropes ofSand-—/imeriea ‘sfuilure in
the Middle East. It was written by
Wilbur Eveland who claims he serv-
ed as the late C.i.A. director Allen
Dulles’s principal representative in
the Middle East itt the i950's.

The C.i.A. suddenly demanded the

book for pre-pubiication review
after it had already gone to press,
and after galley copies had been
sent out to book reviewers.

The Agency, in demanding the
right to review the book, invoked '5
secrecy agreement which Eveiand
says he never saw, Eveiand says, in
fact. that he never actually joined
the C.i.A.. and cannot recall ever
signing any promise to submit his
writings to the Agency.

Eveiand says he wrote the book
because he thought “The American
people needed to be reminded of
the mistakes (American foreign)
Policy has made in the past and
continues to make today."

 

Left Handed Handy

An Ohio college professor says
that tests on volunteer students in-
dicate that left-handed people are
more creative than their right-
handed counterparts.

Dr. Dennis Ciayson of Mount
Union College in Ohio says that the
students in his experiments were
given tests both for their
handedness and for their abilities to
think creatively.

Tube Tied

Americans are watching more
and more television these days. The
Television Bureau of Advertising
reports that T-V viewing by the
average American household reach-
ed a record in February of seven
hours and 22 minutes per day.

That‘s two minutes more per day
than the level of about a year ago,
the bureau says.

Hand over Hangover

A chemical firtn says it may soott
come out with art anti-hangover pill
—- a pill consisting tnainly of ac-
tivated charcoal.

The Reque Manufacturing Corn-

Pany — a firm which markets ac—

tivated charcoal in capsules for in-

ternal use -- suggests that charcoal

ills may be 'ust the thinr to avoid
xx xxxi

the blahs of the morning after.

The company cites a recent Jour-
mrl of Southwestern Medicine
report which found that boozers
who drank whiskey that had been
ﬁltered through charcoal had far
fewer and less intense hangovers
than did drinkers who consumed
unfilitered whiskey.

The Reque company says that
charcoal pill taken immediately
after a night of hard drinking would
probably absorb most of the
headache-causing ingredients from
the drinker's systent. thereby mak-
ing the morning after a lot easier to
handle.

Bogus Bulb

Titrce Phoenix, Arizona.
brothers have announced plans to
mass produce and sell the world's

Page Seven

first lightlcss light bulb.

instead of being called “light
bulbs,” the new invention by the
Bart brothers is dubbed "the dark
bulb."

How does it work? Well. to be
honest. it doesn't: the filaments in-
side the dark bulb have been discon-
nected, and the bulb itself has been
covered with a black enamel.

So what's it for? A booklet that
comes with the dark bulb suggests
it's perfect for watching television
because it never creates a reﬂection
across the screen. This latest version
of the pet rock should also cut
down on energy bills too.
