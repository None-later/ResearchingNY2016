"You either got Iaith or you got non-belle],
there ain't no neutral ground. "
— Bob Dylan, 1979

Ike David Bowie, Bob Dylan is an am»
blguous concept. He stands still long
enough to record an album or two and
he moves on. Stylisticly, he has gone from
country to social protest to rhythm and blues
to country and blues to urban blues to blues to
rock to jazz to electric rock, and now, to
gospel. His voice can grate like "sand and
glue" or It can glide with precisioned grace.
Dylan's craftsman, a musical magician who's
appeared and disappeared out of pulls of
smoke.

Stuart Matranga

Hts messages that he conveys In one phase
are often contradictory to a previous phase.
Sometimes he's highly symbolic as In "Captain
Ahab," or "The Ballad of a Thin Man."
Sometimes he's allegorical as in "lsis," or even
"Tangled Up In Blue." He's direct and self-
confessional In "Sara" and "Changing of the
Guard." Sometimes he's cynical. sometimes
he's romantic. You can call him bitter, sar-
castic. prodding. joking. faking. sympathetic.

with Tiny 35mm camera at six o'clock, two lull
hours before showtime. My mission: to meet
the prophet, or Is It profit (at $15.50 a ticket, I
wasn't sure).

After about an hour the band arrived, but
the big' guy had yet to show. Every ten
minutes, the Hitler youth, or rather the Palace

pitiful. sorry, or idealistic. You can call him
Zimmy, but there's one thing you can't do and
that's believe him.

The best way to approach Dylanis on the
neutral ground, which he clatrns doesn't exist
because It Is‘there, on the narrow field bet-
ween faitb and non-belief, that one en-
counters the Truth of the Self. In his heart of
hearts, Dylan doesn't want that. That's why
he's constantly changing, picking up one
philosophy then bringing It to a new-found
mode of expression and creating for himself
the Illusion of belief. Dylan is an illusion. He's
not some wise prophet who has all the
answers and occasionally. when he feels like
it, leaks out a few cryptic clues in his lyrics.
Rather, he's as confused and frustrated as any
oi us about his role in the Universe. Because
he's groping in the darkness for some sort of
truth to cling to be It demonic or divine. l have
faith in him. I have faith In him because he's a
human being with problems who has the guts
to realize that life is an uncertain thing at best,
and no truth can remain true very long. So. i
don't believe any [of Dylan's messages are
anything more than temporary points of
reference. Yet I have faith that he believes In
whatever his current inspiration of truth hap-
pens to be. l'm on the neutral ground with
Bobby.

became religious, or because he gave up

the old songs, but because he gave up the
old attitude -' an attitude which may no
longer do anything for him, but used to do
wonders for me.

Quincy Nessig

You see, Dylan used to be religious In a
very different way. He worshipped love, his
women, and placed his faith In the sun rising
and watching the moon on a night like this.
He'd cross the lights against him for love; he'd
turn back home for lsis, or Sara, and religious-
ly, he paraded through the twentieth century
World with the guidelines oi his poetry and the
law of love on his own terms. Dylan's old
religion was all on his own terms, and on no
book's or savior's. He created his own set oi

I wasn't the least bit upset because Dylan

 

 

Dylan's latest phase I5 Christ-consciousness
and this. has created controversy because,
though everyone loves Jesus Christ Superstar,
not many are willing to believe that their
perception oi what Dylanls can ever really be
born again Into Christianity. the most
common-place and, therefore, least cool of all
religions.

l'm not sure if Dylan really has been born

again or if this is just another role which he ‘

plays so enthusiastically that me makes himself
believe it. During the show last Sunday night
he looked unsure, doubting. But then I, too,
am subject to selfdelusion. I wondered If the
whole act with the gospel singers and the
Damnation spell was really a comment on
Christianity and American ethics. But i
dismissed this because I do have that faith.
based on my heart, that Dylan does believe
he's following Jesus. No faith, as Dylan
knows, is unshakeable.

lf Dylan didn't believe in Christian belief he
would be a hypocrite. Some believe this.
(During the show Dylan warned against the
teachings of “organized religions." Believing in
Jesus and doubting the Church are not
mutually exclusive.) But anyone who can
make a two thousand year old message sound
new and refreshing must believe in it. This is
my faith in Dylan and this Is what makes Dylan

Now It was my turn to make a grand en-

decided that we should surrender my camera

rules, broke standard ones If It was right for
him, and, coincidentally. enlightened genera-
tions who heard him and related.

But as I said earlier, I have nothing against
Dylan's conversion. i only seek the reasons
why a man would discard a past for a
philosophically different present, and why
with such venom. So even though I still loved
the music, and the lyrics, and his voice, and
seeing him. ljust couldn't relate to something
like this: "I ain't going to hell lor nobody."
Eyen though Dylan was always rather selfish
and never would before, there was always the
feeling that for the right woman, he certainly
might. That blanket statement contradicted
something totally opposite he once sung,
something that used to make Dylan a god
himself, Jesus' brother, not slave.

For wasn't It Dylan himself who actually had
to go to' hell for lsls and would do It once

a pathetic hero. He has nothing. He is lonely
and empty until he finds something, In this
case Christianity, which can inspire him. His
inspiration had been his love for his wife, Sara,
or the plight of Hurricane Carter. It had been
the corruption of society and moral principle.
It had been adolescent insecurity. It had been
the counter-culture and the beats. Now it is
Jesus Christ. Maybe this too shall pass; a tem~
porary way—station until he falls in love again,
But maybe he's in love now. As he said In
concert, "Well, If you need a lover. Jesus will
do that, too." I don't know and that’s the
point. Dylan doesn't want us to know, not for
sure, because he doesn't, nobody does, not
even Christ knew until the end.

Perhaps Dylan and Jesus are aperfect pair.
Both were made Into prophets against their
will. Both were, at times, ridiculed and praised
by their societies. Both were mysterious
figures of ambiguous Intent. Both Inspired

found a solution. Maybe not. He thought he
had found It before, but he didn't. To those
who shut him out because they won't believe

his system of love, going to hell for so-

eone would be like them asking you to go to

In the old days. Dylan couldn't really be
othered with religion. or any constraints. it

as existence on a shoe-string, surviving on
mages oi love that were more human than
: uman, tales of far away places, and stories as
eal as Bill Shakespeare's. When the new
Dylan says “i don 't want to miss nobody, don't
want to be missed " I just can't buy It without
at least a sharp pain resounding through my
body.

Wasn't l the guy that sent Dylan a thank-
you telegram when he showed us how to miss

' someone with grace In “If You See Her Say

Hello;" a guy that Worshipped Dylan because
he realized how great missing someone and
being missed Is; a guy that related to Robert

Zimmerman because everything the guy said
turned to gold in my heart and forced me to
do more than agree. It forced me to believe?

l'm a sinner and I love It. i used to love
Dylan because for him. sinnlng and loving and
ignoring all rules, whether religious or other-
wise. was a way of life.

What the hell happened?

It's funny. The last song on side two of
Desire is "Sara." It's a direct love song. It‘s
Bob's ode to his wile, the woman whom he
married. The man wrote all that stuff about
love's womanly perfection and what he found.
I never realized the utter importance oi Sara
before, but maybe Bob didn't either.

Well, ever since that Desire album, and
"Sara," Dylan has been suffering. His wife left
him suddenly after its release, and after the
praise in “Sara,” one's got to say that either
Dylan was severely deluded or suffered some
terrible blow in his relationship after writing it.

For the marriage did end. in an ugly divorce
suit, with a Hollywood-type settlement creep-
Ing Into the millions. Dylan hated the publicity,
but It was apparently nothing compared to the
agony he was feeling over Sara's loss.

A newly-divorced (or separated) Dylan at
The Band's Last Waltz was tired, bedraggled,
and forlorn looking. His lyrics and musical
style took radical courses away from the
steadiness they'd had for fifteen years. Call me
a reactionary, but that's a steadiness I would
have selflshly chosen to keep. l relied on
Dylan.

Street Legal was off-balance. It was good at
times, even great, but no one can argue that
there was something unsettling about It, some
twist In philosophical character that was Just
different. The Las Vegas type tour of 1978
didn't do much to settle the matter, only con-
fuse it, One could see how changed Dylan
was. how altered.

Dylan began concentrating on his music
suddenly, for one thing. Whether it is Dylan or
his poetry I once idolized, it all seemed coin—
cidental, because it was so real and so human.
But suddenly he gets hurt real bad and the
grand troubador of all time gets scared right
out of the field. avoids love like it's a sin; and
after a year and a half of rambling through
Street Legal, the forced out Buriokun live
album. Jerusalem, and barf reviews. he came
up with Jesus and the Slow Train Coming.

black and opens with “Serve Somebody." He
sounded quite good. The only breaks in the
Inusic were when Bobby began preaching.
"Don't believe any of them organized
religions," he yelled. Was be giving up his
religious kick? No such luck, He went on to
say that Jesus is what counts: "When you
finish taking your drugs, and drinking your li-
quor, and you've had all the girls you could
handle, Jesus will still be there!" Praise the
Lord. ‘

lithe old proverb "Music soothes the savage
beast" Is true, then Dylan logically Would have
started singing. He didn't. He offered the au-
dience a choice: “Which one of these Women
would you lilze to hear sing?" The audience
responded "Bob Dylan." One of the sirens
took the stage, Dylan left, and the audience
went to the bathroom.

Mr. Zimmerman finally returned. He sang a
few more gospel oriented songs and said
goodnight. He did return for two one'song en-
cores and then came the final goodnight.

Over all the music was good and Dylan
sounded In top form. The only thing that was
negative about the evening was the absence of
his old songs. lreallze that the commercials for
the concert advertised a new Bob Dylml- l’m
even Jesus would probably do some of his old

 

stuff! a

crusader — a little chubby In the face and
needing a shave. Whatever your religious per-
suasion, “Serve Somebody," “When You
Gonna Wake Up," and "I Believe In You" got
the place rockin' and reflectln'. Twa new
songs followed. lilting to the effect that Mr.
Dylan was going to Hell for No one ("Not
brother, not sister, not father. not mother")
because He’d been "down that road before."

l thought I detected a tear in Zlmmy's face
during "I believe In You" and tears must've
been flowing for the legion of Jesus enr
thusiasts In the audience who waved their
arms back and forth with palms up in divine
ecstasy. Though the thin man performed none
of his older material — only songs from Slow
Train Coming and a forthcoming album - It
must've been heaven for the old hippies In the
audience who were reborn years ago, maybe
In the early 705 after a rip-off or a bummer on
bad acid or something. "At last, He's seen the
light. too. I knew he would," they mlght've
said, remembering when they themselves
traded in llit'll‘ denim and long, dirty tresses for
Christ's No-fault salvation plan.

"l'd like to say Hello to some old friends
from Woodstock *7 does it still exist?" intoned
Dylan with one of his hazy and unsettling
smiles. l'ltl looked almost drunk. but we knew
better His voice was superb and It broke in all
the right places. The band was hot and en-
thusiastic, featuring on bass 'l'im Drummond,
noted for his Work with Neil Young, and Jim
Keltner of Bangla-Desh fame on drums.

"When Jesus walked into Jerusalem . . .
they all broke branches off the trees. proclaim»
lng him their King," Dylan preached, and his
mouth and eyebrows contorted Into a
"MarlHny-wurds" kind of countenance, "the
same people crucified him — so, you never
know."

You never know, Indeed, What did Dylan
mean by that parable? Was It an analogy to his
own once-faithful flock? Dylan has been an
unstable character the last few years, both per-
sonally and artistically, With every album
released, be Is accompanied by a different
troupe of musicians, seemingly motivated by
something completely different each time.
Dylan could very well be flirting with Chris-
tianity Inerer as a form and abandon it within
the next two years. Nothing at the Palace
Theatre last Sunday night, however, gave any

indication that Dylan would desert the Lord,

ever. His songs In the latter part of the evening

were even more laden with praise to Jesus.
Where Slow Train was rather subtle In its
direction, i.e., its piety, the new never-heard-
before-anywhere songs sounded like pure
Mississippi Delta gospel, particularly when
Dylan took to the piano. His harmonica solo
at the end was — well ~ beautiful. "inspired"
might be a better word.

his show halfway through to talk turkey about
Jesus and the Bible. Yet before, when it was
Just love and living up life, he never had to.
The words and the tunes were quite sufficient,
50 religion has a little pretension about it, and
Dylan's succumbed to It, at the cost of his love.

You know, I just can't conceive of Bob
Dylan spending the rest of his life placing his
brilliant faith In a smart book. l've always
dreamed that he would fly off somewhere with
the one he loved and wave bye-bye with an
evil smirk on his face. It’s not that l'm against
all of this religious stuff for him, but after those
other twenty-five albums l’ve been weaned
on, I feel as If a battle has been lost.

So all of those words are no longer his
possession, because he’s willingly given them
up. He doesn't Include a single old song In his
set, and even some of those (Le. “Shelter
from the Storm") are congruous with his new
feelings. But he can't even do that, for his
painful block against love has stored all that
stuff away forever.

In the end, l‘feel a little empiier. l'm glad I
saw him, because he’s Dylan, but every time
he said something. without thinking, l'd In~
stlnctively think about how Bobby Dylan and
his old love ethic would be able to argue it
down with a single verse. There's just too
many songs to mention a specific one. but just
pick one out and It'll do.

So l'm not mad at Dylan (l have absolutely
no right to be), l'm just sad. He gave up Sara
for Jesus. and I've givun up Dylan but there's
no replacement. Not Jesus, not Bruce 5. and
certainly not Zimmy. He said he didn't want to
be missed, but I miss him anyway. Tough shit.

everyone to "come back tomorrow night,

himself to be upstaged? Who can say what a
