Il'he Day The World Went Crazy

(continued from center/old)

“In Ohio of all places, a second front had
been opened up against the Nixon Ad-
ministration . . . Nixon very clearly sympathiz—
ed more with the National Guard than he did
with the students."

White resigned the following year; on clos-
ed circuit television he explained his fault. as
his wife often had — he was a lousy com-
municator.

"The next president appointed was Nixon's
ambassador to the UN. He had a strong
recommendation from the White House and
promised good access to it -- he'd make sure
that there would be a Federal Grand Jury Ill-
vestigation . . . But. there was no response
from the White House. he failed to keep his

"Ho'w do you make sense out of this? When
we defeated the Germans, we insisted upon
the war crimes trial in Nuremburg. In this case.
we did not want to sit in Judgment of our own
soldiers at Kent State. The FBI recommended
a Grand Jury Investigation. the Civil Rights
Division recommended it — Nixon did not
want it . , . college students were ‘bums.’ "

“By the time they got around to it. too many
people couldn't remember and too much
evidence was gone."

Like many others at the time. Phil wanted
an investigation performed. Instead, several
students and teachers were indicted
“When. my god, no students or faculty
members shot anybody."

Phil and Elaine Anderson (now his wile)
released the study entitled Communication
Crisis at Kent State. Though it was received
with praise from similar authors and commis-
sions. It's content shocked the KSU ad-
ministration.

He stayed on to teach at Kent for another
year. leaving in the spring of 1971 for
SUNYA. He had found it difficult to teach
students after the incident due to their
disinterest in learning and the prevalent
rumors of FBI plants throughout the

classrooms,

“Nothing good so far as l can see has ever

One unusual conclusion of Phil's was that
there were no heroes here. “Such a big case

were no heroes."
