comment

Andrew Pulley for President. Not only did
the editors discriminate against his running
mate Matilde Zimmermann in this. but even
a simple check would have told them that the
SWP has never run Pulley for President
before. Any mention of Patricia Mayberry,
our local Congressional candidate. was
eliminated.

We were further told that a big vote for
Pulley “might indicate popular disillusion-
ment" with the imperialists‘ war drive. “but
it probably will not persuade them away from
aggression." But no one has ever claimed
that a simple vote for SWP candidates would
persuade the rulers to abandon their class in-
terests in pursuing war.

erat i had tried to explain was how this
vote could be part of the ongoing struggle
against war. Instead. in the censored version.
the reader was given the student Skeptic‘s
view of the socialist candidate as a political
Don Quixote.

Finally. we are told that “coming morttlts
will tell" who runs America the warmakers
ot' “the people tired of war. selfishness arid
rrrisundcrstanding." This sentence is atypical
expression of liberal corrfusiort. What is real-
ly unfortunate is that it had to be tacked onto
art article whose rrrairr purpose was to show

ing an election why don’t you do it for all the
candidates. Now. I don't know James
Castro~Blanco. i don't know if i would want
to know him. and i am not sure as to his
qualiﬁcations to be a SA President. But. the
timing of this story annoys me to the limit!

Play With Words

To the Editor:

The Studertt Faculty Basketball game took
place on February 28th in University Gym to
benefit Telethon ‘80. During the course of
the game 15 blue and white alumni jerseys
lent us by the Athletic Department were
stolen front a box in the gym. We appealed to
those who had the shirts to return them. no
questions asked. Only two shirts have been
returned as of this writing. We are surprised
at the lack of corrsideratiort shown by those
involved. if these shirts are ttot returned to
the Student Association office. Telethon will
have to pay rrrore tlrart Slit) to replace tlrerrt.
This rrtotrcy will cortrc front funds that are go-
ing to the Albany State (‘lraptcr ot' the Big

 editorial

Power vs. Power

Lack of communication and a crisis of authority between the SA President and the Election
Commissioner raised some serious questions that must be resolved.

While the SA President is-a member of the election commission by way of title, and no con-
stitutional by-law bars her from interfering with its procedures. it would only seem ethical and
moral for her to maintain a low-keyed position in this area — especially after showing support
for a certain candidate.

Problems of involvement and conﬂicts of interests have arisen before when previous SA
Presidents were known to count ballots. even after publicly announcing their endorsement of
a nominee.

Central Council should meet and seriously consider the issue for in the Gold/Schatsky run-
Off. it is crucial that the tabulations be handled by a neutral Commissioner and able assistants.

The Commissioner and present SA President must work out their difﬁculties way in ad-
vance of the voting's onset.

It must also be made certain that no position hopeful is within throwing distance of the
ballots under any circumstances.

Remembering Kent

Like many Americans these days, we often sit on the fence and depend on the lawyer. the
clergyman. and the government to do whatever should be done. Getting lost irt life's complex-
ities. we often feel too small to make a difference. But apathy cart never be a part of our
makeups anymore. Apathy is what caused “Kent State."

Sunday is the l01h anniversary of the tragedy in which National Guardmen gunned down

the various personal or political motives nrngoittg.

which led Aspects" editors to doctor up my
article. certsoriug it iii the process. ltut one
observation can be tirade. which is that
SUNYA ltas rtot enjoyed a very healthy
climate for free expression recently. For ex-
arrtple. we see the efforts to eliminate
Tangent magazine because it dared to
become. in tltc words of one student
bureaucrat. a “feminist publication".

This climate of intolerance is not unrelated
to the war drive itself. The first task of a
regime wanting to drag its subjects into a war
against their interests is to turrt ptrblic opi<
nlort against any crrrrertt — feminist. Black
nationalist. Lerrirrist — that question its
prerogatives. At SUNYA this effort has
scored some modest sttecesscs. ii‘o bend to its
results is to further errcotrrage the forces
behind it. Democratic discussion of tire issues
in the world crisis cart only strengthen the
struggle against war. Censorship does the op-
posite.

Muckraking?

To the Editor:

1 was looking through the April 29. l9ii()
ASP and what did i see on the third page? I
saw a story with the lteading “Castro-Blanco
called by .l-Board.’ Firecracker had injured
student." Well this sounds pretty serious to
me. When did it happen? i read on to find

_ out. it happened itt October — October! And

now dtte to tire fine investigative nrtd up 10
date reporting the ASP has finally let us
know about this incident. Lucky for its they
printed the story right during the SA elec-
tions itt which James Castro-Blanco is a
presidential candidate. What kind of
muckraking is this? I realize information

elections so Castro-Blanco could reply. since
the incident happened so long ago. i have
seen inconsistency in the ASP's timing ol'
stories before. btrt this is the ﬁrst one that in-
furiates me enough to right a letter.

i find it very hard to swallow that the ASP
was unable to reach Jean Strella for cont-
ment. What did she do? Move to Alaska?
Further. the ASP states that since Castro-
lslaneo has rtot complied with the judicial
recommendation. he has “been rc-referrcd
for not sending . . . (a letter explaining what
happened) . . . to the ASP." according to
one source. One source, you got to be kid-
ding. Was it just that Strella. the source. and
David Jenkins. associate director of residence
programing couldn't be found before
Tuesdays ASP? The incidctrt happened in
October.

If You plan on using these techniques dur-

 

Sincerely.

Budget Reply

 

To the Editor:

l ant writing this letter to respond to the
allegations made against Budget Committee‘s
handling of Tangent Magazine. Let me start
by saying that Budget Cornntittee is neither
power hungry nor unfccling. We have to
budget good programming that will reach the
most people for the least money. so as to
allow tttorc good programming for the
students. The Budget Committee has already
funded over 70 groups at a cost of over
$466.000. The trrtinformcd people who are
screaming rttad about Tangent have never
given thought that the Cortrttrittec has other
worthy groups to fund. too. When we fund
5-Qtrttd and Middle liartlr for over $20,000.
no one said a word. When we funded Off—
Cartrptrs Association to purchase scrccclrcrs
arid door locks for women to protect
themselves. Ito one praised us. When we gave
WlRA (women‘s intratrturnls) twice as rtrttclr
money as last year. no one cheered its. When
we fttttdcd "Athena" (the l‘t‘tttllllsi Alliance
Publication) for $1,000 no one called us pro-
feminist.

if you talk to anybody on budget Commit-
tee. (or anyone else witltin SA). they will
honestly tell you that tltcy do riot crtjoy cut-
ting budgcts. Do you really believe that we
enjoy cttttirtg the budgets of Pierce Hall Day
Care Center. Middle Earth. or Tangent.

When we finished with all the groups. we
were some $15-20.000 over budget. More cuts
had to be made. Bridget Committee had to

ca'stic. quick-axed group of incompetents. I
ask that you come talk to any of us in person.
to get otrr side of the story. before you write
uninformed letters and derogatory editorials.
Finally. if anybody else feels that being on
the' Cornruittec gives you all the power. and
lets you “squelch entlrusiasttt", l suggest you
sit on next year's budget hearings. I think
you would be greatly surprised by what you
would see.

Member of the Bridget Committee

Keep Us On Senate

On Wednesday. May 7th. studcttt represcrrtatiort on the Uttiversity Senate will be discussed
and evaluated. if students as a trrttjority ltave learned anythittg since the turbulent 60's it is that
one rrtusl work witltirt ‘the syslcnr‘ to bring about cltartge and progress. For twelve years.
students on the Senate ltave had a high attendance rate at rrteetings. The considerable nunrbcr
of student-initiated proposals proved that we have made a constructive and conscientious ef-
fort to improve life at SUNYA . President O‘l.eary has corrte out openly in supporting student
reps on the body. Orr behalf of the university. we urge the Senate to do the same.

Apathy‘ Reigns. . .Again

We certainly trope that the four rerrrairrirrg SA hopefuls are refraining from too nruclr
celebrating and congratulations. For the real winner on Wednesday night was Abstain. Abs-
tain received 7,100 votes and is clearly the choice l'or our next SA Administration. Shanre on
you SUNYA...just what will it take to get you to vote?

But. of course. you can‘t answer this one — chances are you’re ttot even reading it.
