durtng a credit crisis. -~

American Express hasn’t changed its application qualiﬁ—
cations for graduating students during the current credit crisis.

That’s because the American Express“ Card isn’t a credit
card. It’s a charge card. There’s no revolving, openvend credit.
You are expected to pay your bill in full every month. So with the
Card, you don’t get in over your head.

You use your head.

American Express is continuing its special application
plan for graduating students. If you have a $10,000 job (or the
promise of one) lined up, you can apply for an American Express
Card right now.

You’ll need the Card for everything from business lunches
to vacations, from buying clothes to buying theatre tickets.

You’ll have new responsibilities after graduation. The
American Express Card will help you manage them.

To apply for a Card, just pick up an application
at one of the displays on campus. Or you can call the toll—
free number 800—528—8000, and ask for a special student application.

does Mr. Motta get John Nelson
and his offense, Richie Helmerle
and his midﬁeld, and Tom Scar-
pinato and his defense to put it all
together all at the same time? if the
potential is there. and the Danes
certainly feel it is, then who's
responsible for the fact that it's not
jelling'l Can it jell by Saturday?

Attackman Mark Waterstram
thinks it will.

"We've got to be ready on Satur-
day. and we sltouid do better there.
We‘ve got to. We‘re a lot slower
than we used to be, and we seemed
to win before by speed, so we've got
to run faster."

Remarked a wistful Heimcrlc.
“We had high hopes for this
season. Our only loss\should'vc
been to Cortland. No team‘s been
much better titan us otltcr than
them.“

"We've got a good team, but we

'can't pull it together.” said

Magrame. “Saturday we'll pull it
all together. We had some breaks
and we weren’t in the right place at
the right time. but we will pull it
together.”

With only four games to go in the
season. they must do so quickly.
Usually a team that starts off slow
and ﬁnishes with fury. a reversal of
that wouldn’t do any good at all. So
the Danes know what's needed of
them and they know that Hartwick
wasn't supposed to be. They know
that they haven't been playing well.
and they know they've got to im-
prove. They know thcy've got talent
and they know they’re not using it
to full potential.

The Albany State lacrosse team
knows a lot. But in light of yester-
day's demolition and Tuesday's
scare. the words of altackman Mike
Slocum scented all too appropriate:
“I just don't know . . ."
