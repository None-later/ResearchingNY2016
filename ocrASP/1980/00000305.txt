Errors Plague 18-10 Softball Win

by Marc Haapel

The Albany State women's soft-
ball team defeated the New Paltz
Hawks. 18-10. Wednesday after-
noon in a game whose innings were
prolonged mainly by erroneous
fielding and erratic pitching.
Although this victory may not have
been the most artistic one for the
9-3 Dance, it was a win nonetheless.

In fact. this game provided
Albany softball coach Lee Rhenish
with an opportunity to utilize all her
troops in order to give them all
some playing time. “I used a lot of
people to gain experience." said
Rhenish.

Ideally, this game might have
been the best one for gainingcx-
perience. Mistakes were more the
rule than the exception. The play in
the ﬁrst inning seemed to be irr-
dicative of the play of the entire
game.

In the top of the first. New Paltz
handily jumped out to a three-run
lead on pitcher Cathy Briggs’ five
walks and two wild pitches. So.
coming to bat for the first time,
down by three. Albany needed to
get some runs back. And that’s ex-
actly what they did.

Nancy Halloran's single and con-
secutive steals of second and third
bases sparked an eight run rally
which put Albany ahead to stay. ,1

But pitching difﬁculties per-
sisted, prompting Rhenish to pull
Briggs in the top of the second and
replaced her with shortstop Lois
Ferrari, who did not have her best
stuff and gave up ﬁve runs over the
next four innings. Following Fer-
rari. the best stint of the day was
ttrrncd in by Albany's third reliever
Attne Solomon, who. despite giving
up two runs in tire top of the fiftlt,
\clllcd doer to pitch two scoreless

innings.

The early pitching problems were
hardly felt as Albany's lead
mounted. Unlike New Paltz. the
squad was able to successfully
capitalize on their opponents’ er-
rors and mental mistakes almost
every time. Timely hitting. or
perhaps timely contact on Albany‘s
part. was enough to bring in most
of the runs.

While it was a contest marked by
less than spectacular defense. two
infieldch for Albany certainly
secured the diuntottd. Immediately
upon being moved over to third
base iii the top of the second,
Halloran converted a tough ground
ball. with runners on ﬁrst and se-
cond. into a dottble play by stepp-
ing on third and gunning it over to
first to get the other force ottt. llut
the inning was not over until second
baseman and captain Katlty

J ayvees Split With Dartmouth

by Anthony lovelll

A very enthusiastic and spirited
Albany State JV baseball learn split
a doubleheader Saturday with Divi-
sion 'l foe Dartmottth at Albany.
The split brought Albany’s season
record to 2-4. The day before the
Jayvees earned their ﬁrst victory
when pitcher Mike Gatto mowed
down the Engineers of RPI. 6-1.
Gatto collected nine strikeouts in
going the distance.

The doubleheader Saturday saw
the Albany batmen take the ﬁnal
game in dramatic fashion, l0—9.

After Dartmouth jumped off to a
quick I-0 lead in the ﬁrst inning, the
Albany offense scored four runs in
each of theiﬁrst two innings. to lead
8-]. The big blows of the innings
were a bases clearing triple by
centerﬁelder Mark McDonald in
the ﬁrst and a run scoring dottble by
Willie Guerra in the 2nd.

Dartmouth closed the gap irt
awesome fashion in the ﬁfth. After
loading the bases. lst baseman Tim
Wall smacked a grand slam on a 1-1
pitch. Albany scored a run in their
half of the ﬁfth and after a scoreless
sixth Albany led. 9-6.

Jim Vauhn, who pitched well for
three innings after relieving starting
pitcher Jim Demitrou, was reached
for three runs in the top of the
seventh before Rich Dwycr retired
tht side. The stage was now set for a
little Albany magic.

Pete Stuto led off with a walk
and was sacrificed to second by Joe
Henkel. Dartmouth intentionally
walked Valosa to set tip a double
play possibility. It almost worked as
(itrctra hit a sharp grounder to the
third hnscmttn. who stepped on
tltird for the force but threw wildly
to first. advancing runners to se-
cond and third. Ronnie Massaroni
was intentionally passed to set up a
force at any base. The move
backfired as the batter was Jerry
Rosen, the leading butter on the
Dane squad, hitting well over .500.
He lined a l-l pitch over the center-
ﬁelders head to give Albany a 10-9
victory. Rich Dwycr picked up the
“W”.

Albany was sporting a modest
two game winning streak after the
win. But that streak did not reach
three. as Dartmouth came back to
beat Albany 12-4.

Mike Gartman started the 2nd

game for Albany but just didn't
have it as lie was reached for six
runs in 3 and 2/3rds innings of
work. Dwycr relieved him but ran
ottt ofgas iii the sixth as Dartmouth
scored six more times to pttt the
game otrt of reach.

Offensiver the Dimes hit two
homers in the game. Kcn (‘tlassman
has a solo shot in the first and Ron
Massaroni had a two rtttt clout in
the ﬁfth.

So far the story with the Jack
Siedlecki coached JV team has been
errors. Too many of tltctn. In the
ﬁeld the Danes were shaky. as they
committed numerous miscus in
their early losses to Hudson Valley
and Coblcskill. They played well in
another loss to West point.

offensively. the Danes are set as
they average seven rttns a game.
Glassmatt and Jerry Roscn lead the
attack for Albany.

 

Curatolo picked up another hard
grounder by the outﬁeld grass in
between ﬁrst and second base to
squash the New Paltz threat.

It might not have been Albany‘s
best win but after the game,
Rhenish remained very satisﬁed
with her team's brand of play.
"The team gets along well together
and that's important." said
Rhenish.

Concerning her team's sluggish
defensive exhibition. Rhenish add-
ed, “We hadn't played since Satur-
day, but things always look better
when you win."

Things did not look so bad on
Saturday either as the Danes swept
Russell Sage in a doubleheader.

cond game was more of a battle as
Albany was tied with Sage at ll
runs apiece in ‘the fifth before
breaking it open with six more to
win the game.

Rhenish commented on the twin
victories over Russell Sage. “We ex-
pected them to be stronger. but we
hit real well."

Boasting a 9-3 record and a high
seed in the upcoming state tourna-
ment to be held this weekend in
Albany, Rhenish is very optimistic
about her team’s chances. “This is

For a team that is battling to keep
their heads abovewater, it was not
the most encouraging of efforts.
Considering that Middlebury came
irtto yesterday's game posting a 2-6
record, it seemed to be an excellent
opportunity for the Albany State
baseball team to finally crack the
standard mark ofa quality squad —
a winning record.

But at the conclusion of yester-
day's contest at Albany, that wintr-
irtg record was even more elusive
than ever. The Danes dropped a 7-4
decision to the Panthers of Mid-
dlebury. a loss that posited
Albany's spring record down to 0-7.

Despite being out-hit 9-8. Mid-
dlebury did enough damage early in
the game to quickly chase Dane
starting pitchcr~ Mikc Clttltcttux.
Al'tcr picking up one rtttt in the first
inning (on a walk. stolcn base. anti
single to left). the Panthers explod-
cd for five big runs iii the third.
Tom ()stler led off with an infield
single. Jim Loveys was hit by it
pitch, and Pete l’rlcc singled to load
the bases. A stroke imo left by Ed
Gunther brought across Mid-
dlebury's second rttn.

'l‘hc game-winning blast then
came off ('lrtbcrtux. Cleanup hitter
Frank Harrison smashed a grand

slam — a towering drive that car-
ried over the fence in left center-
ﬁeld. providing the Panthers with a
6-0 lead and also providing
Clabcaux with an early exit. as
reliever Rich Woods came on to
retire the side.

“It was a high fastball," said
Harrison of his round-tripper.
“Most places we play in don't have
fences — I hit it well, but I think it
might have been caught if there was
no fence. It's funny. I thought he
(Clabeaux) was good. He threw
harder than the other guy' they
brought in. but I couldn‘t touch the
second guy."

Not only did Harrison itave pro-
blenrs with Woods. but his Mid-
dlebury teammates also had dif-
ﬁculty with Woods and his side-
winding delivery. Kcepirtg the ball
low in the strike zone, Woods
allowed the Panthers jttst one rttn
(in the fourth) atrd only four hits in
his seven innings.

But if Middlebury was qttict at
the plate, the Danes were close to
silent. The usually potent Albany
bats could not get untracked against
l’anther hurlcr Ilob Gallo, as tltc
righthandcr kept the Danes off
balance with a sharp-breaking
curvcball. And when Albany did
manage to get something going. the

outcome was nothing but frustra-
tion. In the second inning. Bob Ar-
cario became Albany's first
baserunner with a line single. Rich
Cardillo followed with a long dou-
ble to center, but Arcario was forc-
ed to delay on the bases because the
centerﬁelder came close to corrallng
the drive. When the ball dropped.
Arcario went from ﬁrst to third,
and with Albany coach Rick Skeel
waving him on, Arcario came
charging to the plate, only to be
thrown out to stifle the scoring
chance.

There was more frustration for
the Danes. In the third. a slow roller
by designated hitter Tony
Moschclla and two walks loaded the
bases for Albany with one out.
Bruce Rowlands then hit a hard
grounder up the ntiddle —~ right at

Netmen Beat RPI But Drop Three In Last Week

by Larry Knhn

The Albany State men's tennis
team capped off a rough week with
a 7-2 victory over a weak RPI team
on Tuesday. The win followed a
loss to Division I Colgate on Mon-
day. a rare defeat in the SUNY
Center Tournament over the
weekend, and a loss to Amherst last
Thursday.

Tuesday’s win at RPI was ex—
pected because, as Albany men‘s
tennis coach Bob Lewis said. “RPl
is just not a good team. We didn't
play particularly well. but we knew
they weren‘t really that good so we
gave a lot of guys a chance to
play."

Lewis shook-up his lineup for the
match, with Larry Linett. Randy

Young, and Andy Diamond sitting
out and Kevin Laurilliard. Dave
Avergun and Steve Kaplan making
rare appearances. The match also
marked the return of Lawrence
Eicltcn after a ten day layoff.

In singles action Barry Levine
moved up to the number one spot
for Albany and easily defeated
RPl's Bill Smith, 6-1, 6-1. “Levine
played very well," commented
Lewis. ln second singles Eichen
struggled a little in the ﬁrst set, but
came through in the end, handing
Rich Brown a loss in straight sets.
7-6, 6—3.

Dave Lerner “played a good
match." according to Lewis. as he
tnanhandled Steve Angle, 6-I, 6-2.

First Place In Tri-Meet
For Women’s Track Squad

The Albany State women's track
team took first place in a home
mcct Wednesday. with 79 points to
Sicna's 37 and Russell Sage's nine.
“We didn't run all the events
because the other teams didn't have
people for them," said Albany
track coach Barb Palm.

Barb Hill. Winnie Weston, Sue
Stern and Kim Bloomer took first
place in the 880 meter relay and the
440 meter relay, “coming irt a full
ﬁve seconds ahead of the second
place team." Palm said. She cott-

. tinucd, "They also just missed the

qualifying time for the rcgiontlls by
two-tenths of a second."

Sue Kallcd took first place in
both the 100 rrtctcr hurdles and the
400 meter hurdles with a time of
67.4] seconds. lowering ltcr own
school record. Freshman .lulic
Smytlt followed Kallcd in the 400
with a 7l,l second Iirnc. Weston

and Claire liiclcjcc took third irt
that event. Hill was ﬁrst iii the 21X)

Albany’s slim 3-2 lead appeared to

squared off against Rl’l's Jott Wit-
ter in his “ﬁrst-ever match" for
Albany. btrt he staged art impressive
two set win. 6-0. 6-I. to carry the
lead into doubles.

Albany then put the icing on the
cake. sweeping the doubles cont-
petition with only one team that
had ever played together before.
Eichcn and Levine teamed up for
the first time in first doubles and
easily defeated RPl's top team, 6-2,
6-1. The Laurilliard—Avcrgun corn—
bination played as well in second
doubles as they usually do in the
more familiar third slot. outclassing
RPl, 6-1, 6-4. Tire team of Lerttcr
and Kaplan found the right formula
in their debut performance to ﬁnish
out the day, 6-2, 6-I.

“We played adequately," Lewis
concluded. “We played tlrcnr in the
fall and beat them, 8-1. We knew
their strengths in advance and we
were ready for them."

in Monday‘s match the Danes
were outclassed by Division I
powerhouse Colgate. The match

was played indoors because of the
Weather and was mercifully stopped
after singles when Colgate clinched
it. 5-1.

“Colgate has one of the best
teams in the east.” noted Lewis.
“We have never beaten a Colgate
learn." The only win for Albany
came in ﬁrst singles when L‘inett
pulled out a hard-fougltt three set
victory over Chris Winkle. Winkle
edged him in the ﬁrst set, 6-7, but
Lirtctt battled back to win the next
two, 6-3, 6-2. “it was a very good
win for Linett." said Lewis.

In second singles Levine put on a
good show for tltrce sets. but came
away on the short side of the 6-7.
6-2, 6-4 score. “Levine played well
for us." Lewis noted. “But the rest
of the team was beaten by better
players. Colgate has an excellent
learn."

The SUNY Center Tournament
was held last weekend in Buffalo
and for the ﬁrst time in three years
Albany didn't win it. This year
Binghamton walked away with the
crown with 14 points. Albany plac-
ed second with lI points, and Buf-
falo‘s presence was not obvious
with only two points.

Linctt and Levine excelled for
Albany. each winning both of their
matches. Linetl upstaged Bingham-
ton‘s top man, Mark Lifschitz, in a
very strong effort. 8-2 (pro set). He
was equally as impressive in his 8-6
victory over Buffalo's Todd Miller.
the runner up in the SUNYACs last
fall. Levine won two hard fought
matches against Binghamton's Neil
Roher. 8-6, and Bill Kaiser of Buf-
falo. 8-5.

The rest of the ladder fared well
against Buffalo. but couldn’t
muster up a win against a well
balanced Binghamton squad.
Young. Diamond, Lerner, and
Avergun all split their two matches.

The only major upset of note
came in the Albany-Binghamton
first doubles match. Lifschitz and
Roher avenged their earlier losses to
Lirrett and Levine by upsetting them
in a tiebrcakcr in what Lewis said
was “a very good doubles match."

Lewis felt that the absence of
Albany's number three man,
Lawrence Eichen. could have been
a deciding factor. “if Eichen was
there we could have won," he said.
“We were right in it up until the end
— it was a real dogﬁght. We really
played very well. if Eichcn was
there it probably would have been
decided by one point either way."

Eichen’s absence also hurt
Albany last Thursday when they fell
to Amherst, 7—2. “We were really
hurt without having Eichen in

there." said Lewis. “1 think we
would have beaten them if he was
there.” Tire effect of losing a player
high on the ladder is not limited to
just one match. When Eichen. the
third man on the ladder, is out. four
players have to move up and face
stiffer competition than they would
normally have been up against.

This effect becomes. obvious
when you look at the results.
Although Linett was upset irt first
singles, Levine won in the second
spot, but none of the players who
had been forced to move up a notch
could come up with a victory. The
only other Albany ‘ win against
Amherst came in ﬁrst doubles with
Linen and Levine teaming up to
take it.
