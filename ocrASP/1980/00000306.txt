Inconsistent, 4-5 Stickm’en Look For Answers

by Jay Glasen _

If a single word can describe it.
it's inconsistency. 11‘ there's a look
that says it all, snap a picture of
coach Metro. If you're looking for
a sentence, then Mark Watcrstram
said it best: “Just about everything
is going wrong.” ,

Well. almost everything. The
Albany State lacrosse team lost
badly yesterday. but they did grab a
triple overtime victory on Tuesday
afternoon. bringing their current
record to 4-5. But despite the
scores. despite the standings
despite talent, youth. and ex
perience, despite everything except
reality. the Danes have been playing
poor lacrosse lately. and no one ex-
actly knows wiry.

it was a mediocre llartwick
squad that came all too close to vic-
tory on Tuesday, sending what
sltould have been a fairly easy
Albany win into a tension-filled, tri-
ple overtime close call, as Richie
lleiinerle finally had errotigli arid
put in the-winning sudden deatlt

goal unassisted. The final score was
8-7 but it could have easily been the
other way around, and the Danes
know it.

f‘We should llu\‘Utl()llL‘1|ltlL'll bet-
ter against llattwick," said mid-
fielder (ilen Magraiie, “they jtist
weren't that good. We played down
to their level."

Maybe so. but Albany outshot
Hartwick (41-24). had ritore
groundballs (52-36). and cleared
better. But despite that, the Danes
just couldn't keep possession of the
ball that much, and a 40 percent

‘ t
face-off success added to the dilem-
ma.

Said Heimerle. “We were hurt
bad on the face-offs. We were los~
ing sixty percent ofthem. so we just
didn't have the ball."

And when they did have it. they
weren‘t quick enough, so they
couldn‘t generate any fast breaks.
arty quickly set up shots, few goals.
By the time the shots came. it stable
Hartwick defense was set up. and
Albany became the victim of 20
Hartwiek saves as compared to
their own nine.

Yesterday, similar offensive pro-
blcms stopped an already lturting
Albany squad dead in its slow mov-
ing path. Sierra (7-2) iriarched
bra/ciily onto the Dutch Quad
field. moved quick. passed well.
and met with a listless Albany
defense that gave tip 15 goals to
Albany's six. All around. it was
probably Albany's worst effort all
season.

Albany handled the grotnidballs
adequately. bttt Sierra picked up a
lot more. Sierra got off a lot more
shots. though, especially in that
fateful fourth quarter when they
outscored the Danes 5-1. And even
though the face-offs were more
even than against l'lartwick. the
Danes were shaky with the ball.

“We‘re not settling dowti when
we get the ball." reitiarked
Heimcrle. wlto came tip with two
goals and art assist, “We're giving
up too many fast breaks and we're
not able to get many. There's a
general lack of hustle. a lack of
thinking. They just weren't that

much better than us. There was no
reason to get blown off the field."

Perhaps not. but that's the way
the Dane cookie crumbled, and
Moria has exactly a day to put it
back together again, when Albany
plays Brockport tomorrow in what
should be a fairly easy victory if
there are some positive Changes in
outlook and forrti.

For example, in yesterday's
game, Albany not only didn't take
advantage of the man-ups they had.
brrt they gave up goals instead.
With an extra player on the field
during opposition penalties -—
ttsually the fast break little for any
offense — Albany was jttst as slug-
gish as ever. and Sierra, responding
to their disadvantage with vigor and
quickness, ltiriied it around and
came tip with several man-doer
SL'UFL'S.

Said team captain ilcimerle.
“()ur man—up is hurting its more
than it‘s helping us. We gave up
four mart-up goals and that's
ridiculous. Sooner or later. our
man-tip plays have to work."

Defciisively. the vigor that seem-
ed so promising in the early part of
the season seems to be falling apart
these days as Albany is becoming
easy prey to the fast breaks of their
faster, more responsive opponents.
Sicna opened tip yesterday's game
with a sport of four unanswered
first quarter goals, and pegged two
more in the second quarter before
Albany was able to put one in.

Said dcfcnseriran Vic Emanuello.
“When a team gets ahead 6-0.
there‘s something wrong. We gave

up sortie garbage goals and we
didn't pltiy very well."

Heirnerle thinks differently. "1
don't consider it a defensive pro-
blem. The whole team’s got to settle
itself down."

And that's where the inconsisten-
cy problem enters in. On the
groundballs. what Motta called the
key problem last week, there was

improvement. But the defense
plummeted. in the goalie's net. Ken
Tirmait has been coming up with
some clulclt saves. But the offense
died. in the penalty situation.
Albany has gotten less than any op-
ponent this year. But the man-ups
have been doing virtually nothing.
So what is a coach to do? How

The rains went to Williams. so
Albany and Union came to Univer-
sity Field. Downpours Monday
night forced the shift frotit the
scheduled triangular rtteet between
those schools at Williams to a dual-
ittecl confrontation of the two
Capital District rivals. it wasn‘t
much of a confrontation, thouglt.
as the Danes literally ran all over the
Dutchmen, winning 103.51. The
meet was the last dual—nicer of the
season for Albany. wlro at 5-4, now
go iitto the SUNYAC champion-
ships at lirockpot‘t.

"Really all we were doing was
gctiirig the meet in and getting them
(the teairt) sortie work." corn-
mentcd Albany ltcad track and field
coach Bob Munsey, feeling that the
meet was basically a tune-up for
tomorrow.

Munsey was upset over tire fact
that Williams. whose dirt and
cinder three lap-to-thc-mile track
was unusable due to the rain,
cancelled out ofthe meet. “I prayed
for raitr because 1 just didn't want
to run there." said Munscy. “l'm
glad we didn't run there." The
coach also didn't appreciate the fact
that Union left some of their top
runners honrc. "Union was not
represented as they should have
been," 'continued Munsey, noting
that ’the Dutchmen held back
several men that would have meant.
according' to Munriey. about 32
points. which wouldn't have won
the meet for Union, but “would've
made it closer.” '

The Danes truly dominated their

opponents, winning 13 of the 18
events. Of the five that Albany lost.
tirree were field events. Union’s
Brad Kilne took the hammer throw
(119 feet. 10 inches), but Dane Al
Bokser was second (108 feet, one
inch). The Dtitchrnen took the top
two spots in both the pole vault and
the shot put, with Albarry men Paul
[iichelbcrger and Don Cordell get-
ting thirds. respectively.

The other two Union wins came
in the 5000 meter rttrt (where Ed Ar-
iiheiter was first in 15:33.4, 15.6
seconds faster tltan Daitc Todd
Silva). and iii the 400 meter dash. in
the latter. Matt (inilfoyle's time of
50.9 seconds (a track record) was
just enough to beat Albany's (.‘itrt
Dcrtton (51.2 seconds) and Tony
Ferrctti (51.5 seconds).

The two relay races were taken by
Albany combinations. liill McCar-
tiit, li‘erretti, Jeff Knight, and
liowic Williams ptit together it tiiiic
of 44.8 seconds in the 400 meter
relay to take that one. while the
quartet of Jim Cunningham, Steve
lErh. Ferretti. arid Demon won the
mile relay in three minutes. 28
seconds.

Williams won both.the 10(1 and
200 meter dashes. in' 11.03 seconds
and 22.3 seconds. respectively.
Albany swept all three scoring spots
it) those races.

The 110 meter high hurdles saw
Dane Mitch Harvard win in 16.3
seconds. with Cunningham getting
second. A 57.8 second time by Crin-
ningham lit the 400 meter lir-
termediate hurdles was good
enough to beat teammate Pete

l’assidomo (61.3 seconds).

Two more track records fell to
Albany runners. Scott James broke
the old mark in the 1500 meter run
with his time of four minutes. five
seconds. Bruce Shapiro broke the
tape of the 800 meter run irr one
minute. 58.2 seconds, also putting
him in the record books.

Field events weren't a
catastrophe for the [Juries for once.
as they won five of cigltt. liill Con-
doit took the long jttritp with a leap
of 5.87 meters (1‘) feet, 31/4 inches).
He also won the triple juriip (12.46
meters — 40 feet. 10% inches). In
the javeliri throw. (iradirr Avery’s
lling (if/17.47 meters (155 feet. eight
inches) took first. AVery was also
third in the long jutnp. Cordell won
the discus evertt. hurling it 35.81
meters (123 feet. fottr inches), and
in the hiin jump. the Albany duo of
Ned Miller and Tim (.itllllllUl' tied
for the lead at five feet, cight iri-
chcs. btit Miller had less misses at
that height and was awarded first
place.

Looking to this Weekend‘s
SUNYAC championships. Munscy
feels that the ever-present problem
of lack of weight men will be
ntagtrificd. and will squelch arty
hopes for art Albany victory.
Thinking back to the season’s
beginning. Munsey noted that “I
really tlionght we were going to
have sortie help" in the weight
category. aitd was painting for it her
cond or third place finish in the
SUNYAC. But now, hls attitude
has changed. "l'd he very happy to
