r Searching For Housing

 

by Bntce W. Fox

Steve Klein found a house off-
eampus in less thatt a mortth. Stuart
Thalblum’s search took nearly three
months. And Leslie Rubenfeld.
who has been looking since
February, is still looking.

g HEWS‘F-EATURE

All three of these students have
been engaged in a task wlticlt. ac-
cording to SUNYA Off-Campus
Housing Director Frank Green, has
become increasingly difficult over
the past few years. Furtlter. says
Green. it is a task which is rtot likely
to become any easier as the fall
senrester approaches.

According to Green. competition
for off-campus housing this year
ltas been fierce. “People started
lookirtg for places very early this
year. Some started right after
Christmas. Usually, people don’t
begirt looking until the rttiddle of
February."

Short Supply; Demand High

about thirty reputable landlords
who own tort or more apartments.
This year. by the third week in
March. every one of those lartdlords
ltad been sold out.

“There is simply a general
housing shortage in the city of
Albany." said Green. "Students
need very high initiative to ﬁnd a
place. A lot of students spent days
going from ltousc to ltouse artd ask-
ing if the people livirtg tltere were
seniors."

Green said that lie does trot ex-
pect any great flux of new openings
this tttorttlt. "May is basically as
difficult a month as arty. Summer is
the worst time to look. A lot of peo-
ple corrte up here in Atrgtrst tryirtg
to find a place. But tltat's the
month when there is tlte least
arttotrttt available."

Off-campus housing is still very
much a "seller's market." As in the
case of SUNYA student Leslie
Rubcttl‘eld. ltotrses are irt short sup-
ply and demand rtttts high.

“We’ve had rotten luck." said
Rtrbertfeld last week as she scanned

Albany Police Still Hunt

For Pine

by lieth Sexer

About tltrce or four SUNYA
worttert ltave been attacked irt the
last four weeks lit the Pine Hills
area by a mart the police believe is
the “Pine Hills Touclter." accor-
ding to Albany Police Dcpartrttent
Detective Joseph (ialante.

Galantc said lte is probably the
same mart who has been entering
women’s apttrtrttcnts since the
beginning ol~ last semester. artd
touching them until they awakert.

According to a composite por—
trait based on descriptions frortt the
victims. the attacker is reportedly a
ntale Negro, aged l7 to 25 years. He
is approximately five feet. seven irr—
cites tall. weighs l'ront l30 to I70
pottrtds. artd has black. short crop-
ped hair. His complexion is
anywhere from light to rneditrm col-
or. and he ltas a slim to rnediurrt
btrild. with a muscular upper torso.
He is usually seen wearing a green
army fatigue jacket, blue
dungarees. and dark clothing.

The mart referred to as “the
'l'oucher" reportedly enters female

students’ apartments through ‘

unlocked back doors artd windows
between the hours of ll:30 pm.
and 4:30 am. Sometimes he lingers
itt the apartment for an hour before
entering a woman's bedroom. said
(ialttnte. In the bedroom. the man

Hills Attacker

touches the worttan‘s private parts
until slte awakens. whereupon the
attacker Ilces. usually from ltis

poirtt of entry. (ialtrrtle said.
(‘ralattte does rtot believe that the
attacker "cases" the apartments ltc
enters beforehand. He suggests that
perhaps he tttakcs only It casual
observance. such as by looking at
the mailboxes. "l cart ittst look at
continued on I)(ll.’(’ sit

the posted index cards in the off-
campus. “I‘m totally frustrated. I
may give it all up and just try to
find some people who already have
a house and need an extra persort to
fill it out."

Rubenfeld said that site and her
friends ltave been looking for a
three-bedroom apartment since
February. “We started out going
from ltottse to house. asking if peo-
ple were moving out irt .lune. That
didn‘t work. Since March. we've
cltecked these cards irt the off-
campus lounge every day. But tto
matter wltat we find. something
always turns out to be wrong with
it.”

“We have one prospect which
looked pretty good trntil recently."
slte added. “But now. we have
reason to believe that something is
wrong with the lease. Also, we've
heard rumors that the landlord has
a bad reputation."

Another SUNYA sltrdettt. Stuart
'l'hrtlblum. said ltc finally succeeded
irt finding a four-bedroom apart—
tttcrtt a week ago after searching for

three rttorttlts. Thalblum said lte
relied far less extensively on the
posted index cards in the off—
crtntpus lounge.

"We saw (lo/ens of places." said
Tlralblunt. “The first few places we
saw we learned about front the in-
dex cards. These places ttrrncd ottt
to be tltc most slimy. disgusting
holes I‘ve ever seen. Itt fact. they
were actually worse than tltc ltole l
livcd irt this year. which I didn't

i t : I
think was possible." (P m n U] S)

“Naturally.” corttinued
Tlralblum. “we eventually decided
to refer to the index cards far less
often."

The rtext tactic 'l'ltalblunt and his
friends attempted was to try and
firtd acquaintances who had nice
places attd were planning to tttovc.
“We saw two really gorgeous places
that way." said Thalblurn.

J ohnpoll Sees Bureaucratic Waste

 

Attacks SUN Y Central, Administration

by Susan Mllllgan

As professors stood to lose their
jobs under Carey‘s proposed
brrdget. most would expect them to
be itt bitter opposition to the SUNY
budget cuts.

Not so with SUNYA Political
Science professor llcrnartl K.
.Ioltttpoll.

In a column recently prittted itt
the Knickerbocker News. .loltnpoll

‘sutpriscd many be corttrttenting that

“...Carcy and the Legislature
would do well tie! to restore the $20
rrtillion to the SUNY budget.“

Yet .loltnpoll is not anti-
educatiort; his objections to the
budget deal with appropriations
with the SUNY budget. specifically.
“overspertding” on adrnirtistratiort.
According to Johnpoll. “at least
(the $20 rttilliort) cart be cut front
SUNY's budget” without darrtagittg
the quality of education.

"I did not say ‘cut the budget."‘
lte explained. “Unless you‘re really
careful about the cuts. you're going
to get rid of the University. But the
budget cart be cut with certain
Iirttitations."

.lohrtpoll designated four tttajor

areas itt which ctrts or elintinations
could be made: SUNY Central Ad—
rttinistration. The SUNY Founda-
tion. local University atlntinstra-
tiort. and tire hiring of “prestige”
PILD. professors.

"SUNY (‘cntral can be
elitttirtated or cttt dowrt to a two-
rttan operation." said .Ioltnpoll.
(SUNY) has the "highest University
cost" Irt tlte cotrrttry. btrt rtot tlte
“highest education cost."

.loltnpoll. who charged irt his
editorial that "SUNY Ccrttral of-
fers neither constructive leadership
nor coordination to the disparate
ttrtits of tire system. objects to what
lte feels is the bureaucratic nature of
the administration ortall levels.

"The University is art educational
Ilililg—diol artotlter bureaucracy."
he said. “Education is at It
rtrirtirtttrrtt wltilc red tape is at a max-
inturrt."

.loltrtpoll feels also that “tile
SUNY Foundation sltould also be
done away with." stating that "it
serves Ito real purpose except to
shield the real cost of SUNY Cen-
tral." He continued to explain that
“some of the furtds...l'rorn the

federal governntent...has been used
to cover unaccounted ad-
ntirtistrativc costs. The state should
control these expenditures or at the
very least know how each cent of
these funds is being spent."
Johnpoll is disturbed about high
administrative costs on a local level.
arid cited particular examples at
SUNYA as evidence.

“(O'l.eary‘s) attcrrtpt to name
artotltcr vice—president is
ridiculous." said Joltrtpoll. “Why
do we need another vice-president?
It doesn't help education."
Johnpoll is particularly annoyed at
the “needless” appoirtttttertt of
dearts and assisstant dearts.

“At the same tirtte they were cut—
ting faculty," he said. “they changv
ed from one dcart of the College of
Arts artd Sciertces to tltrec. artd two
or three assistant deans to six. What
does this add to education?"

In his column. Joltnpoll ques-
tiorted the employment artd salary
of art urtnarrted administrator:
