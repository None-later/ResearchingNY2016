Here’s some cheerful news:
Americans are reportedly murder-
ing each other at the average rate of
one death every 26 minutes.

That's according to author John
Godwin who has written a book titl-
ed Murder U.S./t..- The Ways We
Kill Each Other.

Godwin says that in the last
decade the homocide rate has
doubled for the U.S. as a whole,
and increased live to six times in

 

some cities. He adds that the
number of killings among strangers
has quadrupled. claiming that a
“new style" of American violence
is a growing tendency towards mass
murder.

Godwin says that this tendency to
murder and violence is unique to
the U.S.. adding that it is a myth

in

He says that the notion that
alleviating poverty will also alleviate
violence is erroneous. He claims,
for example, that Haiti. the poorest
spot in the Western Hemisphere, is
one of the safest spots on earth.

Skunk Rock

A Dallas, Geno mar who in-
tensely dislik k till! i; has come
up with a rather unusual way of get-
ting a skunk familv out of his
house.

Slim Payne came home one .-vcn-

could hear thumping and baby
skunks squealing under the floor of

After following many unsuc-
cessful suggestions from friends,

that plays the worst music, around
the clock," turned up the volume
and poked the radio in a vent hole
under the lloor.

0n the third day, Payne checked
the vent and found that the small
creatures had taken off for the hills.
According to Payne, “I still don't
know if that music for two days was
worse than the skunk or not.”

 

No Pot Paul

Paul McCartney says he has

Off-Campus Housing Market Tight

('(Ililfllllt’dﬂ‘filil [mad ﬁve
“Unfortunately. the first/was way
out of our price range. and the‘
other had a bedroom which didn‘t
have a door." -

Thalblum conceded ' that the ,
bedroom with no door was lux- '

urious compared to other rooms he
saw. “We saw bedrooms with no
windows," said Thalblum. "We
saw bedrooms that had to be
entered through other bedrooms.
And we saw bedrooms that were
about the size of a closet—and a
small closer, at that."

Thalblum said he then began
checking the classified ads in the
Albany Times-Union. Other
students, however. were apparently
doing the same. "I would buy the
Times-Union at 8 in the morning,
call up a landlord at 8:30, make an
appointment to go see the place at
i2. and then find out that someone
had signed the lease at Ii."

According to Thalblum, most of
the landlords he met during his

search were good natured and
helpful. “We met one landlord,
though, who really freaked us out.
He looked and acted just like the
Nazi doctor in ‘QBVII.’ We
couldn‘t decide whether he was
more likely to castrate us or drill
our gums."

Tlialblttni ﬁnally found a place
by knowing somebody who knew
somebody.“‘lt didn't surprise me
that we ended up getting a place
through connections. l'm convinc-
ed that unless you have lots of time
on your hands. finding a place on
the open market is extremely dif-
Iicult.“

ding a house on the open market.
however. SUNYA stttdcnt Steve
Klein, who began looking around
mid-March, was able to find a two-
bedroom place in less than a month.

“We went to see it total of three
places." said Klein. “The first one
was a hole. The second was too ex-

Klein said he found the third

Although difficult, then. finding
a house off-campus is not irirpossi-
ble. With a little luck. as in Steve
Klein‘s case, it can even be easy. As
Stuart Thalblum explains. “We just
kept looking until we found a place
that we liked."

Journalism Professor Earns Honorary Degree

lronweed. Kennedy, a Siena
graduate, worked for the Times-
Union and the Miami Herald and
free-lanced for The Atlantic. The
Republic, The New York Titties
Magazine, and others. He was also
Look magazine's Book Editor and
a teacher in the Capital District
Humanities Program.

He claims his biggest accomplish-
ment was co-founding The San
Juan Star in Puerto Rico in
November I959. Gardner Knowles,

then publisher and owtter of Look
magazine, decided to invest in a
newspaper, and “picked tire to be
Managing Editor. We made a
newspaper out of nothing." Ken-
nedy said. mentioning that the
newspaper was recently sold for $9
million dollars.

The third concern in his life, after
literature and journalism. is film.
Kennedy is a film critic. and has
writtctt a full screeii‘play for a New
York producer and several screen

treatments. (synopsis of screen
plays) for another New York pro-
ducer. Kennedy is “presently work-
ing on one with another screen
writer that seems to have some pro-
mise," he said.

Kennedy 'may teach fictional
writing at 'SUNYA in the fall at the
graduate level. "I ltave been told
that‘s what's planned for me, which
I’d like very much. I have been
teaching independent study in
creative writing," he said.

Residency or financial in-

of Public Affairs Bruce Sicgel said
these hearings will be "lenient."
and hopes sttidents will not be put
off by the hearings and forfeit their
right to vote. In aii effort to make
the process easier for students.
Seigel organized a single large
public hearing on the Brockport
campus last week. At the hearing
students could take care of the
whole process at once, he said.

However, according to Joe

tions of the Brockport Student

Voting Rights
Government, most on-campus
students are not independent,_ so

their parent’s home is considered -

their legal residence. The students
will have to vote through absentee
ballots.

LaValle said that “students
shouldn’t neglect their right to vote,
especially now. Students can bring
about pressure with their voting
power and eventually will be dealt
with as an interesting group." He
added, “it is the role of student
government to get students to vote
by making the registration process
simpler."

A drive will be started this fall to
increase on-campus voter registra-
tion. In addition, he said students
will be able to register at some local
shops in the community.

The present New York State
Election Law still denies SUNYA
students voting rights in their col-
lege community. However. work is
in progress, recording to SASU
Vice President'for Campus Affairs
Tony Giardina. SASU has been
campaigning for student voting

' rights for the past six years. They

tion to loosen voting laws.

years after ltc became a dean. a
survey proved him to be incompe-

year. As a dean it rose to 535,000.
When he was demoted to
faculty—still a poor teacher and
barren researcher—he was paid his
dean's salary (less a small amount
which he could make up by teaching
.six weeks iii the summer session).
Other good teachers are generally
paid about $I9,000 a year. In-
competence, thus, pays well."

The UUI’ (United University
Professions) disagrees with
Johnpoll. because, he said, “they
represent (also) the non-tenchlng
professionals and the low-level ad-
rrtitilstrntors...it is my impression

 

University did not charge us for ser-
vices. Now I think the whole idea is
deceptive because many people do
not know what is in the contract
and expect these services to be paid
for by the University which is the
taxpayers' money." he said.

“The taxpayers’ money for a col-
lege education should include
more than paying a professor's
salary. It should include the vital
services necessary to all students
such as garbage retnoval and elec-
tricity. said Faber.

He said. “If we are charged
anymore it will be publicly embar-
rasittg to the University. We will
enlist the help of our parents and all
students in a letter writing cant-
paign to keep these services free of
charge. The University has the final
say."

“()ur extra argument is that tnost

this back charge is unfair." he said.

"The function of a University is
to meet certain needs,"- said
Johnpoll. “The first is for
undergraduate education. and the
second is for graduate education.
The graduate education has to be

.lohnpoll stated that “there is no
demand for graduate education."
