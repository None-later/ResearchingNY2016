Islanders Finally Have That  Feeling

UNIONDALE. N.Y. (AP) - The
New York Islanders have spent
years cultiviating a winning feeling,
ind now that they have it - finally .
they are making it pay off in the
National Hockey League playoffs.

“Everything on this club has
come up really quick." says Al Ar-
bour, coach of the eighth-year club.
“we were the worst team in
hockey. Tiien. in our third year, we
were in the seventh game of a
semifinal against Philadelphia.

“And then. the next year. we're
supposed to have tltc Stanley Cup
all wrapped up - already here. It's
always been like that on our
players. extra pressure." said tltc
coach.

The difference this year. follow-

ing summer after summer of ag-
gravation over playoff failure, is the
Islanders have found a way of cop-
ing with the stress of expectation.

"After a while. you say. ‘Tlic
heck with it. We‘ve got to get
together rind work it out.”' said Ar-
bour. “Now. nothing scents to
bother them."

As a result, the Islanders own a
3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres iii
their best-of-scvcn Stanley Cup
semifinal and stand only one vic-
tory away from their first birth iii
the championship round. A victory
in Crime Four Tuesday night would
send New York iitto ilic final
against the winner of the
Philadelphia FlyCI‘S-Mlliilchulil
North Stars series.

"They’re really getting a taste
now, where it‘s getting close and
they see what they've accomplished
to this point on hard work," added
Arbour. “They know it‘s going to
trike more of that, digging deeper
and deeper. They start getting that
fccling. ‘Wc can do it and we want
to do it.‘ and that’s the feeling they
have riglii now."

The reason. says dcfcnscttian
Denis Potvin: “For the first time
in the history of tlic islanders. it's a
total effort. It's not just three or
four players that tire doing well in
tlic playoffs. And that is to catalyst
in the whole tctiin feeling very good
tibotil itself.

“The confidence is instilled.“
l’oiviii continued. “It‘s not

something you have to work at to
get. It‘s there. We‘ve proven
enough to ourselves that we can
come back. that we can hold a lead.
that we can play tough. that we can
play a skating game - we can do
anything.

"I think that's the sign of a
champion." said Potvin.

Right wing Bob Nystroni took a
more cautious outlook on the near
future. though only two teams in
NHL playoff history - the 1942
Toronto Maple Leafs and I975
islanders have won a series after
losing tiic first three.

“I think we’ve got it in our minds
tlitit thcrc's It possibility we can do
things this you. there's a little bit of
confidence that says maybe we can

“But as far as we're concerned. we
have our backs to the wall and we
have to win."

A New York victory would be Its
12th in a row over the Sabres and
would tie the Montreal Canadians’
playoff record for most consecutive
