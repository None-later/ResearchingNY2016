The Albany State women‘s tennis
team left home Friday with a busy
weekend ahead of them. Their ﬁrst
match was Friday night against
Concordia. They spent the night in
Westcitester and met Long island
University (LlU) on Concordia‘s
courts Saturday. When the Danes
returned that night. they did so with
a H record for the weekend. and a
3—2 record for the season with one
match remaining.

LIU. who has no home tennis
courts and are forced to play all
their matches on the road or a
neutral court. wanted to play a ten
game match consisting of seven
singles and three doubles. Albany
women‘s tennis coach Peggy Mann
usually avoids this type of match
layout but decided that "they
(LIU) were so much weaker than
us. the format could not lutrt us.
and I cotlld get tnorc girls into play.
so I agreed." The team was far
from hurt by the format. respon-
ding with it 9——l victory over LIU.

In singles, Albany‘s number one
player Nttncy Light won her match
(l—-(). (l—(). Second singles player
Attnc Ncwmttn dcfcttlcd her oppo-
nent (1H0, ()—I.

Sue Bard. Karen O’Connor and
Michele Guss. numbers three four
and ﬁve players respectively. all
won their matches by scores of
6—l. 6—l.\ .

Dane number six‘player. Elise
Soloman beat' her opponent 6—0.

‘6—0. and seventh player Amy

Feinberg won 6-«0. 6—3.

In doubles. the combination of
Light and Newman. was unbeatable
as they won 6—1, 6—0. The
number three pair of Kathy Comer-
ford and Nancy Levine won their
match 6—3. 6—2.

Not all Albany players ablcto
win their matches this day though.
Saturday. it turned out to be the un-
fortunate duo of Marlene Rafter
and Chris Rodgers that ran into
trouble, losing 3—6. 2—6.

Mann was pleased her team did
so well'against LIU. She was even
happier that others got to play.
Mann was also pleased that her
team had rebounded from the loss
the night before. .

Friday evening's match against
Concordia was played indoors. and
to the disappointment of the
Albany hackers. it was played
against ll very strong and
undefeated Concordia team. Coll—

somewhat closer to winning

the second and brought the third to
a tie breaker. before losing to Con-
cordia's Stacy Cook 1—6. 6—l.

(playing III the number four spot)
who ﬁnally came through with the
team's first win. beating Patti
Pudavnno. 6—4. 6—l. Mann felt
that O‘Connor. “never played bet-
ter for me than she did in that
match.”
