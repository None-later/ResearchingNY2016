Lacrosse Team Picks Up ActiIn 22‘-

by Jay Glasen

During halftime of last Thurs-
day's Albany lacrosse team’s 15—6
defeat. coach Mike Motta basically
had seven words for his team:
“Pick up your jocks and get mov-
ing." \

it seems that the Danes ﬁnally
picked up on that request whenvthey
took their team on the road to
Brockport this past Saturday. even-
ing their record at 5—5 with a
22—15 win that saw at least two
team records tied and the highest
Dane scoring effort all season.

The inconsistency that has been a
catchword for the team all season
struck again on Saturday. as things
that went wrong during the
previous games went right. and
things that were normally pretty
stable went a little wrong.

For one thing, the man-up pro»
blem that had plagued them against
Siena suddenly disappeared on
Saturday, actually being the saving
grace for a team that fell behind
early to an opening quarter
Brockport onslaught that saw them
go ahead, 4—0.

"Our man-ups were good,” said
attackman John Nelson. who
scored eight goals during the game
to tie :1 Dane record. “They kept us
in the game during the first half.

Most of my goals were in the man-
up position."

The ﬁrst quarter was indeed the
one that gave the Danes trouble,
but by the end of the half. it was all
tied up at thirteen.

“We played terrible in the ﬁrst
quarter," admitted Nelson. “but
then we got moving after that."

Midfielder Ken Gorman agreed: '

“We were flat in the ﬁrst quarter.
They scored four right off before
we scored one. After the first
lquarter. our defense settled down a
ct.”

it was the second and fourth

quarters that saw a sparked Dane
offense cottte up with three-quarters
of their goals. Midﬁelder Rich
Heimerle. Dane veteran and learn
co-captain. tied an Albany record
for points irt one game. coming up
with three goals and nine assists for
a walloping twelve poirtts.

Defertsivcly. Tim Siddal played a
solid game. and after the first
quarter. the entire Dane defense
scented to ltold together despite the
high scoring total.

Also, one of the key assets irt
Saturday's game was the clutclt
playing of the Albany bench. spear»
headed by a razor sharp Henry
Clark. wlto came lit at the start of
the second half and helped get the
Danes energized for their second

half of play.

Looking at the past, present and
future, it still remains a difficult
task to categorize this inconsistent
team. The Danes'have alternated
wins and losses since the start of the
season. and they haven't even been
able to put together two wins in a
row. They've got three more games
to go. today, Thursday. and Satur-
day, and if past years are any in—
dication. the Danes might move
from lukewarm to hot.

"We just haven’t been able to
put any streaks together." said
Gormatt. "New Haven and Colgate
(today and Thursday) will be tough
games. if we get the breaks, we
should beat them. We've beaten
New Haven the past two years."

“it won’t be easy." remarked
Nelson, “but i think we should win
the rest of them. if we get out in
front early, we can stay in front."

So the Dane season is almost over
and the team still remains a
mystery. The key word is still incon—
sistcrtcy. and despite a Brockport
wirt, despite a New Haven squad
that went dowrt at the hands of
Albany two years itt a row. and
despite the concise advice of art
emotional coach. the wisdom of
John Nelson seems to ring truest of
all:“You just never know what’s
gonna happen with us."

Trackmen [530mb Out;” Get Seventh In SUN YACs

 

Sprinter Howie Williams, Only Dane
Victor, Takes 100, 200 Meter Dashes

by Bob Iiellaflore

"We bombed out. We did ter-
ribly. l was really embarrassed that
we didn‘t do better." That about
sums up ltow Albany men's track
and field coach Bob Munsey felt
regarding his team's performance in
last weekend's SUNYAC chant-
pionships held at Brockport.

n" “bunt State men's truck and field tettm had

l“rcdonia won the title virtually un-
contested with 176 poirtts. Buffalo
State was their nearest competitor
(85 points). The Danes came irt a
lowly severttlr (out of it) learns) irt a
meet that. only last week, Murtsey
had expected to finish third or
fourth in.

“We really did awfully as a

learn." continued Muttsey. but he
noted that there were sonte good in-
dividual performances by members
of his squad, the best of which was
had by top Albany sprinter Howie
Williams. The sopltotnorc won botlt
the 100 meter and 200 meter dashes
irt l0.7 seconds (by the length of a
sltoulder lean at the tape) and 22.4
seconds. respectively. "it was like
Howie had five gears arid
everybody else had four,” said
Albany sprinter coach Kevin
Callahan of Williams performance
in the 200, a race in which he'll
represent the Danes at the NCAA
championships later this month.‘

"Williams came through. but
nobody else did." said' Munscy.
who singled otrt liill Mathis and
lirucc Shapiro as two men irt the lat—
ter category. By failing to score irt
arty of their respective events.
Munscy figures the Danes lost out
on a total of [446 possible points.

Another pctl'orrttttnce. or lack of
performance that irked M nnscy was
that of (‘urt Demon who, after
placing sixth irt tltc 400 ntctcr dash
(time of 50.4 seconds) simply disap-
peared. couldn't be found, and
nct'et showed up to rttrt his leg on
the Albany 600 ureter relay learn.
“No doubt we would've placed,"
said Munsey of his relay combo had
Demon been present. Demon was
subsequently thrown off the tcttm.

Despite the negative aspects of
the meet. some runners besides
Williams had good days. Scott
James ran it time of three minutes,
59.3 seconds iii the 1500 meter tint
and got fourth place. l’aul
liichclbcrger ran the 400 meter in-
termediate hurdles irt 57.7 seconds,
which is 4.5 seconds faster than his
personal best front last year. "I
think that's rather phenontirtal."
said Munscy of that statistic.

(Williams. Tony Ferretti. Jeff

irt that event itt 44.1 secortds. Mike
Sayers finished fifth in the 5000
meter run 05:55.6) but, according
to Munsey. “He looked terrible."
Munsey felt that Sayers was still
feeling the effects of his NCAA

1n the 10.000 meter run. Todd qualifying race in the 10.000 meter

Silva was fourth irt 33:15.5 and the
Albanv 400 meter relay team

run last week. and that may have

]taken away from his race Saturday.

Next weekend members of the
Albany squad will travel to Cor-
tland for the New York State cham-
pionships. With 22 schools com-
peting. Munsey notes that it will
“be even tougher." and that the
Danes will only be going for per-
sonal best performances. “We're
not even going for a team score.
we're going for individual efforts-
that's all." -- ‘ Munsey.
