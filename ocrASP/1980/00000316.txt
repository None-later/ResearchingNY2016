There are road trips. and then
there are road trips. And this sum-
mer, the Albany State basketball
team will embark on one of their
most distant trips ever, when they
board an SAS airliner bound for
Sweden. '

The Dane squad will arrive in
Stockholm, Sweden on August
18th, where they will play a series of
between eight and ten exhibition
games against neighboring club
teams. before they return to the
States on September 3rd. .

According to NCAA regulations.
a college team can schedule foreign
tours only once every four years.
and the Danes last traveled abroad
in 1976, when they competed in
Poland.

“The last time, in Poland, really
was great." said Albany basketball
coach Dick Sauers. “At that time,
we changed our whole offense
around -— we went to the motion
offense. And when we came back
from the trip we were a real close-
knit group. it’s deﬁnitefy wor-
thwhile. both education-wise and
basketball-wise."

While the stint in Sweden will un-
doubtedly be enjoyable. the Danes
will get no vacation when it comes

down to basketball; The competi-

‘tion, which will primarily be teams

with older. non-professional
p1ayers.-should challenge an Albany
squad that ﬁnished their 1979-1980
campaign with a 21-6 record. in-
cluding a spot in the NCAA Divi-
sion llI_.playoffs..

One team the Danes definitely
will face is the Central Team, and
that’s where the Albany connection
comes in. That squad. which com-
petes in SWeden’s second league.
contains two people with strong ties
back to the Danes, University Gym.
and Sauers himself. The Central
Team's coach isGary Trevett, who
in 1977, graduated frotn Albany
State. where he started as guard for
the Danes, and who still holds the
Albany record for assists in one
season. The other Albany
transplant who plays a prominent
role on'the Central Teanr is Barry
Cavanaugh. a 6-7 center who star-
red for the Danes for four years
(19761979). Cavanaugh currently is
the lone foreign player on the Cen-
tral Team.

Besides the Central Team. which
Sauers considers “comparable with
Albany," the Danes will also go up
against other strong, experienced
clubs. “We will play teams of
various competition." Sauers said.

“We want to play some of the
teams in their top league, which is
like good Division 11 and low level
Division 1 teams. We deﬁnitely
have one of those teams schedul-
ed."

After the initial plans were ar-
ranged, the Danes' trip still had one
major roadblock before Sweden
became a reality — money. The
Central Team is sponsoring the trip
in Sweden, where they will foot the
bill for Albany's expenses while in
Sweden. "But." said Sauers. "we
still need eight thousand dollars to
get us on the plane." That money is
currently being raised by contribu-
tions to the Albany Basketball
Booster Club. and also by the sell-
ing of advertisements and booster
spots in next year’s basketball year—
book, a new publication which will
be unveiled next season.

“We found that this is the best
way to raise funds." explained
Sauers. “Last time. we had a lot of
different ways. But if we don't meet
our goal. the players will have to
contribute for the trip themselves."

Championships Show That Softball Team Belongs

by Marc Haspel

'At the outset of this season. the
goal of coach Lee Rhenish and the
young Albany State softball team
was to make the New York State
Championships which were held
Friday and Saturday here at
Albany. Twelve games- later, after
having compiled a line 9—3 record,
the Danes deservedly achieved that
goal, placing them on the same level
with the best Division 111 softball
teams in all of New York. Though
they only won one of the three
games that they played in the tour-
nament, the Albany squad played
quality ball. proving to everyone
and themselves that they can play
with the top teams in the state.

Albany opened the tournament
Friday morning with an 8-5 win
against Stony Brook in 11 innings.
the game was a real defensive strug-
gle. a pitcher's duel. especially after
the seventh inning when both teams
were deadlocked at ﬁve runs apiece.
After three full extra innings of

'play, Nancy Halloran-—-the even—

tual choice for all-tournanrcnt team
third baseman—got things started
with a single. Halloran then stole
second and came home on center-
fielder Lori Cohen’s single. First
baseman Carol Wallace followed
with another single and before it
was all over Albany had scored a
game winning three runs.

Linett And Levine Tabbed

For Nat? _.nal Tournament

by Larry Kuhn

The NCAA Division 111 National
Tennis Tournament selections were
made last Thursday and chosen to
represent Albany State this year
were Larry Linett and Barry
Levine. They are among 64 players
selected nationwide for the totrrrra-
ment which will be held in Clair-
mont. California on May 14—17.

“l'm very happy that we're go-
ing.” said Albany men‘s tennis
coach Bob Lewis. “it's always one
of our goals to go to the Nationals.
it's an honor to be selected. but it
will also be a great thrill for us
because the playoffs are in Califor-
nia this year."

Both players should be entering
the tournament pending funding
from the post-season contingency
fund of the Athletic Finance Conr-
mittee. but Albany'Athletlc Direc-
tor' Bob Ford said that "that
shouldn’t be a problem." Last year
Albany had three players selected

for Nationals. Linett and Lane

first round nuttch before being
eliminated. but rurrrtbcr one player
Patti licldman was forced to sit out
with an injury, The tcttrrt still finish-

This year Linett and Levine are itt
top form. Both have been selected
to play singles and they are the first
alternate irt the doubles competi-
tiort. Linett. a senior. has a 15—8
record playing for Albany, and
Levine was 15—5 in his first year.

“Both of them are very com-
petitive and will give a very good ac-
count of themselves." said Lewis.
and Ford agreed. “We have two ex-
cellent candidates this year — one a
senior on the way out, one a
freshman on the way in. it's too
bad we can't get them all here
together at the same time.”

And Linett and Levine? “We’re
just happy to go," said Linett.

into the top of the eleventh, Nancy
(Halloran) and 1 were really psych-
ed to do it. She got on, I singled and
she scored."

With one win under their belt.
the Dane's returned that afternoon
to face the top seed in the tourna-
ment. Queens College. Against the
very highly rated school. Albany
played extremely well. in fact after
four and one-half innings of play.
Albany was ahead. 2-1. However.

Rhenish started Lois Ferrari on
the mound. Despite allowing five
hard luck runs. Ferrari did a terrific
job. Rhenish only had praise for her

pitcher. “Lois pitched an excellent

After being retired in order in the

Forced Off Senate

 

Surprise Vote Ends Twelve Year Representation

Twelve years of student represen-
tation on SUNYA's policy-making
body ended Wednesday as faculty
members voted down a motion call-
ing for four-year extension of stu-
dent representation on the Universi-
ty Senate, 114 to 112. The decision
will result‘in the elimination of 33
student seats.

The students will. however. be
allowed to serve on Senatc commit-
tees.

Extension of student representa-
tion on Senate is voted on every two
years. The 1978 vote supported
students “overwhelmingly” by 80
percent. according to student
Senator/ Mark Borkowski. “l‘m
very surprised — i didn't think we
would have any trouble gettim the
votes," he added.

According to Borkowski. the
overriding concertt was to have a
quorum present — in this case. 20
percent of the faculty — to make
arty legislatiort binding. if a faculty
tncrnbcr calls for a quorum and the

f

‘ required percentage is not present.
no legislation could be passed. in
this case. student representation
would have expired automatically.
Borkowski said. ‘

According to chair of the nrecting
Kendall Birr. although a quorum
was present at the beginning of the
meeting. the four-year extension
was voted down. When a new rno-
tion was made calling for it one-year
extension of student representation.
some faculty got up and left and a

rnolion was dismissed.

llorkowski remarked that tile
one-year extension attempt “would
have had a trutclt better chance of
gettitrg passed."

Birr noted that “the quorum may
have been lost in a matter of 45
seconds."

Student organizations such as

Student Union (SU) and SA are
currently circulating petitions
among faculty members rrrgirtg
President O'Leary to call an
emergency faculty meeting on Tues-
day. O‘Leary has agreed to call the
meeting if at least 10 percent of the
faculty signed the petition. if a
quorum of 20 percent is present at
Tuesday‘s meeting. it would be
possible to pass a rnotiott llttll
would extend student representa-
tion on Senate.

SU Chair .lim Tierney. however.
remarked that “getting the
cnrcrgerrcy meeting won't be the
problem; getting the faculty tltcrc
will be.” '

llirr commented also that "they
wouldan have a chance in the world
of getting a quorum."

issue could be rc-evaltrated at the
fall faculty meeting. However, a
quorttrn of 40 percent would be tlte
requirement for passage of the nio-
Iiun.

Those faculty rttcmbers who
spoke in opposition to the motion
at tltc Senate meeting said they were
not against student representation
on Scuttle ttltogchtcr. Professors
llurry Hamilton and Malcom Sher-
man botlr suiti' lltey objected to
students being iii a position itt
which they could decide honor stun-
tlards, academic standards. gradua-
tiott requirements, and other issues
they fclt “wcrc tltc responsibility of
the faculty W not the students."

Thebnttle is over! After a tight runoff. Sue Gold has emerged
victorious over Gary Schatsky for SA president and Brian Levy
overcame Frank Baitmun 1n the vice presidential race. Although
the final count was close. Stte Gold came out with 55 % of the

vote and Brian Levy received 54 %. A total of 2338 turned out to
hole for the presidency and 2190 for the vice spot.

They recommended a system within
which students would be excluded
from voting on such issues.
Another reason for faculty op-
position to the extension. according
to Borkowski. was that for the first
time. students were asking for a
four-year extension. as opposed to
11 two-year extension. all of which
have been granted in the past.
llorkowski feels that some faculty
are against student representation
in tltc Senate for a four-year period
because they would not have a
“check” on the students.

Lester, Students Battle Voting Laws

A legal suit for student voting
rights in Albany was filed irt U.S.
District Court Thursday. according
to SA attorney .lack Lester.

“Eleven students are bringing the
suit on behalf of themselves anti all
other persons similarly ‘situatcd.

Student rights violated.

This then would affect all students
in the state." Lester said.

The defendants in the case are the
commissioners of the Albany Cottrt-
ty Board of Elections and o/thhc
state.

The defendants filed suit
cltallengittg the New York State
statute which prohibits students
froru voting.

One defendant. Stephen
Schrieber. petitioned that he has liv-
ed independently from his parents
for the last four years. He swore
that his parents do not maintain any
living quarters for him. He said his
permanent address is in Albany.

Another dcfcndant. Andrea
DiGregario petitioned that site is an
"Albany County resident at this

it is the center of my domestic.

consider it to be my borne and l

Budget Cut; Teams Terminated

by Paul Schwartz

Two sports have been cut from
next year‘s SUNYA tithletic budget
due to the elimination of a state
funded coaching line. Both the
men's volleyball team and the
junior varsity cross country team
will not return as intercollegiate
squads next semester.

Tltc teams are being cut despite
offers from the respective coaches
to stay on without receiving arty
salary for their services. "The
money doesn’t mean a damn thing
to me," said men’s volleyball coach
Ted Earl. "It all goes back to the
kids anyway. The program belongs
to students.”

llttt according to SUNYA
Athletic Director Robert Ford, that
situation would not be feasible. "1
think there are problems with hav-
ing volunteer coaches." Ford said.
“i honestly don't feel we should

run an athletic program that way.
it's a bad precedent. and it puts the
volleyball and junior varsity cross
country teams iii a different area
front the rest of tire learns."

The two terminated teams were
selected after meetings between the
Athletic Planning and Policy
Board, Ford. and SUNYA Vice
President for University Affuirs
Lewis Welclr. in those meetings.
criteria was set up for dctcrrninirtg
which sports would be cttt. Men‘s
volleyball funds were sttpplicd by
the eliminated coaching litre. and

thus was evaluated using the
criteria.
Besides Earl's salary ($2300).

Ford cited other factors which led
to the decision to cut the men's
volleyball team. “Volleyball ex-
ploded on tlte college scene in the
late 1960’s and early 1970's." ex-
plained Ford. “That's the Slime

tintc Title IX catnc otrt stressing
equal opportunity for wotncn irt
sports. so rmttty schools cottld not
start volleyball programs. Many
schools have volleyball teams that
are still at the clttb level. and I don't
see that changing in the rtcttr future.
That makes scheduling tough, and
it nrcttns we have to travel further
than we would if they weren't clttb
Icarus." .

Welch stressed that a team's suc-
cess during the season was not a
major factor in assessing individual
sports. This past year the men's
volleyball squad showed a 16-6
record. including it berth in the
playoffs. The junior varsity cross
country team posted a 12-2-1 record
in their mccts.

“Each of the criteria we applied
was used as u reference." said

Welch. , - 7

According to Lester. tltc students
are counted in the Albany census
for purposes of state and federal aid
and also for apportionment
through delegation of representa-
tion for state legislative districts and
federal congressional districts ac-
cording to population.

“it's discritnituttury: it's not fair
not to give the students a voice in
things that affect their lives. like
police protection, housing. treat-
ment in the courts. zoning-or-
dinances turd trtxcs. Rents are based
on property taxes. For students who
rcrtt. this amounts ‘to taxation
without representation.”

Lester said. “Because of the fact
that you’re a student, the law does
not grant you residence in Albany.
The lttw says that average citizens
only have to he a resident for thirty
days or be eighteen years old in
order to vote. it singles out
students. The defendants say
students are not really bona fide
-t't:sl(lcnls and therefore. shouldn’t

be allowed to vote.

He continuesl "There are 25.000
disenfranchised students in Albany.‘
They have their fundamental rights
violated because llte fundamental
right to vote. guaranteed trndcr the
14th (equal protection as citizens)
and the 2(th (right to vote at 18 or
over) amendments is denied them.

Students applying for voting
rights in Albany have to fill out a
questionnaire that inquires into a
student‘s personal life with ques-
tions involving financial matters
concerning financial aid from
parents. bank accounts. and financ-
ing their education.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled
that these types of questions are un—
constitutional, Lester said.

"basically. this is a bill that's a
direct hit on SUNY students allover
the state. it was enacted in 1971, the
srunc year the 18 year old vote was
made law. The state legislature was
responding to a fear of student
voters in their district." lte said.
