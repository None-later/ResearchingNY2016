[SUNYA Policy Protects Homosexuals

by Susan Mllllgan‘
After eight months of negotia-

V tions, PresidentVincentO'Leary an-

nounced Wednesday he has ex-
panded current University policy to
include protection against
discrimination on campus
regardless of sexual or affectional
preferences.

According to O'Leary, "the
statement is designed to give addi-
tional strength to the University’s
commitment to equality of oppor-

Federal law does not prohibit
discrimination on the basis of sex-
ual or affectional preferences.

The statement also provides for a
means to review and investigate
claims of infringements of the
policy, and for means of dealing
with such grievances. _

Due to federal legalities, the
policy was developed independently
of Afﬁrmative Action, a federally-
funded organization which deals
with‘ discrimination complaints.

Student Housing: Poor Picks

by Sylvla Saunders

When Dave Lester and his three
roommates signed the lease for a se-
cond floor apartment at 159
Western Avenue, they thought it
was a bargain to get the place at
$320 per month plus utilities.

“But as soon as we moved in we
started noticing all the things we
missed when we checked the apart-
ment in the spring. The cracks in
the wall were covered with masking
tape and painted over. The beds
and the furniture were shoddy.
There was no insulation and the
drop ceiling swayed with the wind.
The porch steps sagged and the rail-
ing was rotted to the poiirt of
crumbling. The carpeting was worn
and the rooms needed paint all
over. i could handle the ants and
mice, but the idea of rats did bother
me a little . . .

“Over Christmas vacation the
snow on the ﬂat roof thawed and
backed up frorii the sink-size drain.
The ceiling caved iii over the kit-
chen and bathroom. We couldn‘t
go to the bathroom witlrotrt an trin-
brella. It was like sornctlritig out of
a movie in Appalachia. We had
water an inch on the floor and pails
scattered throughout the apart-
ment. When the landlord t'inally
ﬁxed it, he used a lialf»inch thick
tile to cover the old caved-in ceiling.
But water kept coming through.
The cockroaches loved the moisture

 

“eren the springtime thaw
caiire, so did another cave-in. liy
that time we just laughed about it.
it got to be a joke after awhile.
Besides. we knew it wouldn't be
long before we cotrld get orrl. We
couldn’t report it because we were
in violation of the anti-grouper law
and we didn't want to split up.

When it ﬁnally did come time to get

"We get about sixty complaints
about landlords every semester,"
said SUNYA's Off-Campus Hous-
ing Ofﬁce (OCHO) worker Judy
Schultz. She pointed to an overstuf-
fed greeu looseleaf binder and
said. “We try to keep a record of
them all."

“it’s hard to say exactly how
many students have problems with
their landlords," she continued,
"because by the time someone
comes here, the person feels as if
it’s out of his control."

Schultz said the major problem
of off~campus housing is that
students will compromise
themselves in finding an apartment.
“They're afriad there won't be
enough left, because they hear that
everyone else is looking for an
apartment. So they'll take the one
that doesn't have a hack staircase or
a window in the bedroom," she
said.

“Housing in Albany is harder to
get than in the typical college
town," according to Director of
Residences John Welty. “Out of
the whole 15,000 population of the
campus, it’s only possible for a little
over 6,000 to live on campus. This
obviously creates tremendous com-
petition t'or apartments in good
locations."

One Pine Hills landlord. Mrs.
Multair, rented out her twenty units

by early March. “We rented earlier
this year than ever before," she
said. “We even had calls at
Christmas. Most of our apartments
were rented out to friends of
tenants before they were even out of
there."

OCHO Director Frank Green
said, “There is a general housing
shortage in the whole city.
However. this is compounded
because students crowd into such a
small area close to the bus routes."

“If students were willing to live
off the bus line," he said, “there
would be a lot more housing
available." He especially suggested
that students search in the New
Scotland Avenue section of the city.
"For students who have cars or are
willing to use pttblic transportation,
there's no problem," he said.

But for students who lack a car or
the patience and money for public
transportation, their only option is
to find an apartment iii the Pine
Hills area around SUNYA‘s
downtown campus. Green said
landlords take advantage of this de-
mand and students are sometimes
subjected to apathetic landlords.
high rents and poor, soriretirires

One of the major complaints
from students is the high cost of

creased iii price considerably,"

SUNYA’s Gay and Lesbian

had no recourse at the time.
O'Leary stressed also that "any
policy statement is limited in its ef-

tunity must be grounded in the
commitments and actions of in-
dividuals." O'Leary added that he
“urged all on this campus to give
life and meaning to this policy."
O'Leary said his deVelopment of
the policy is "in reaction to a Senatc
bill" urging the President to adopt
the statement to University policy.

_ Kent State Revisited - Ten Years Later 

by Susan Mllllgan

On May 4, 1970, students at Kent
State University, Ohio rallied to
voice opposition to US. action in
Cambodia. On the grounds of
“rumors of violence,” Kent Mayor
LcRoy Satrom had called in the Na-
tional Guard. But the outcome was
anythiing but peaceful as the Guard
opened fire on the students.

____._...__——

Nine were wounded.

Four are dead.

On May 4, 1980, students at Kent
State rallied, marched, and held a
candlelight vigil iir memorial of
those wounded or killed teir years
before at Kent State and Jackson

 

 

State. A total of aobut 25 speakers,
including Bella Abzug, Dave Dell-
inger, Stokley Carmichael, George
Wald, and four of the nine wound-
ed at Kent were present, and eight
musical groups performed.

The National Guard was not
there.

The atmosphere was not angry,
but “very emotional," in the words
of wounded student Alan Canford.
The message, and the theme of the
demonstration, was clear:
“Remember Kent State with the
New Way fo Resistance."

“We want no more campus
massacres. a stop to the possible
draft. and no war," said Canford.

The rally — 2000 strong and
representative of states for from

Ohio — lasted ﬁve hours,and the
vigil lasted throughout the night, as
people took turns holding candles
and keeping them lit: Apparently,
Kent State has not forgotten.

Canford has remained active as a
spokesman for the May 4 Task
Force, a committee (independent of
the University) that organizes corn-
mcmorative actions each May 4 and
sponsors educational forums, lec-
tures, and films aabout the Kent
State shootings.

“Every freshman goes'to a May 4
forum," Canford said. “We want
to raise awareness about the inci-

.dcnt."

The May 4 Task Force, which has
“the full support of the families of
the slain students,“ was begun in

1975 "after years of discussion and
insults in courts....and attempts by
the administration to cover-up,"
Canford said. .

The Task Force has dealt with
and acted upon many issues regar-
ding the Kent State incident. A few
years ago, nearly 400 were arrested
while protesting the proposed con-
struction of a gym on the area of

i the shootings.

“We wantedto keep the site of
the attack as a memorial...so people
could understand what happened,"
Canford said.

The gym, however, was built
despite the protests, "one chapter
in a ten-year struggle," according
to Canford.

The organization also deals with

Drunk Bus Drivers & Ignored, Complaints

by Kurt Schnakenberg

This is the ﬁnal part of a four-
part series dealing with the SUNYA
Bus Company.

This article is the culmination of
the ASP’s investigation of the
SUNYA buses. Ater many inter-
views and issues presented in the ar~
ticlcs, sonic questions still remain to
be answered. .

__.._____.___———-

Tlie previous three articles expos-
ed several bus service problems.
Among these were that busses were
off schedule, extensive vandalism
ot‘ the buses by students, a lack of
overtime funds for drivers and a

hiring freeze that made it difﬁcult
to keep the buses on schedule, a
declaration from a driver that the
evening drivers would park their
bus on a side street and skip rtins,
use of old equipment, and a lack of
communication and syriipnthy bet-
ween tlre drivers and their superiors
at the garage. Most of these pro-
bleriis still remain.

One major problem for the
garage is sttrdcril vandalism of
brrscs. linscs with seats that are rip-
ped are covered with graffiti may
fail inspection, ntrd rt large part of
the bus mechanic's job is spend in
cleaning and repairing seats. The
large buses with back doors are
another headache, since students

Another problem has been stri-

misses its schedule, these corri-

contemporary issues including the
draft, registration, and the
possibility fo a foreign war, Can-
ford said.

Canford added he feels there is
more student activism today than
two or three years ago.

"I think it is mainly because of
the question of the draft," he said.
“And the numbers will increase
because of the war threat...(The
Carter administration) is trying to
whip up pro-war hysteria...but we
have not forgotten the horror of
Vietnam."

May 14, 1970 does not riirg as
clear in one’s mind as the date 10
days before. Because the
demonstration at Jackson State
University, Mississippi concerned
not only the Cambodian issue but
the racial issue, it was less discussed
and less recognized. But, students
at Jackson State refused to ignore
the fact of two strident deaths near-
ly ten years ago.

About l00 people marched from
the dormitories in which the
students were killed (one was shot
while iii the T.V. room) to the Stu-
dent Union building Sunday,

. Jackson State strident government

member Muso Akapeliva said.
(‘omnriscd of botli students and ad-
inintstrtuors, the group sang Gospel
songs, observed a dramatic presen-
tation, and listened to individual
speakers on a panel discuss the
the incident. Members of the panel
included people who were students
at the time of the shootings — one
of whom, llilhnrm Frazier, is now a
member of the Mississippi state
legislature.

Tire administration was ap-
parently supportive of the
memorial: many mnrclred and
President John Peoples spoke in
regard to the incident.

The mood, Akapcliva said, was
calm, the atrirosphcrc rirorc iri-
dicutive of a mechanical than it pro-
test.

Kent, Ohio, and Jackson,
Mississippi were not the only sites
of campus unrest in the late '60’s
and early '70's. Arid iii I980. the
Kent and Jackson State slayings
were remembered at campuses
throughout the country.

About 250 members of the
Albariy community gathered in
Washington Park Sunday to
remember the dead niid wounded
from the Kent and Jackson State iii-
cidenls. The Albany Peirce Couli»
lion organized the daytime rally —
with speakers and iiirtsicians and air
evening candlelight vigil in front of
the Armory on Western Ave.

 

To all my dear friends,

’Life is a series of bellos and goodbyes-

l'm afraid it’s time for goodbye again.’

Thank you all for the great times and
memories that have made my years here
at SUNYA the best oi my life. -
