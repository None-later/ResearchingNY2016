Students Charged $2.50 F orRug

by Beth Sexer

Fourteen students in chanccy
Hall may have to pay tip to $2,500
to replace a carpeting they saturated
in a waterfight last Thursday night.
according to one student involved,
Lorraine lnden. ~ -

1ndcn said that although "the rug
was saturated" after their water-
fight, “1 don't think there was any
permanent damage." in fact, lndcn
recalled two incidents when the
students soaked the hall carpeting
even worse. Usnally. if the hall is
cleaned by Monday morning,
nothing would be said of the mat-
tcr.

However. last Monday Colonial
Quad Coordinator Howard

Woodruff and Resident Director
Jessica Casey had a mandatory
meeting for deLanccy ,Hall
residents. said lndcn. The they
"passed out a questionnaire with 14
questions on it about destructive
problems in the dorms." Most of
the inquiries. said 1ndcn. "were ir-
relevant to those living in the
dorm."

According. to lndcn, Woodruff
and Casey “were implying a lot of
things that we had done that we
didn't do." For example. lndcn
said that they were blamed
wrongfully {or vandalism that oc-
curred when others thrcw bccr bot-
tles at the building. Woodruff and
Casey also implied that they would

'dctermine how to divide an

estimated cost of $2,500 in damage
incurred over the year among
deLanccy Hall residents. lndcn
said.

Tuesday morning the rug was
removed from chancey Hall. ac-
cording to 1ndcn. However. the
tack strips were left “along the
walls and stairs." making it
dangerous for people to walk
barefoot in the hall."

Another student involved in the
watertight, Stcvcn Pepper. said that
it is unfair to blame the fourteen
students for the removal of the rug.
“The rug was fifteen years old; it
has been totally worn away." said
