The Green _Machine Series

continued from page jive

Yet some drivers can get away
with murder, claim several sources I
spoke with.

“You get somebody who has
been here for twelve years or so and
he can skip all the stops and leave
early and never hear a word. Some
of theSe guys have been here so long
they forget they are working for the
students.”

This problem can be seen in the
case of one driver accused of drink-
ing by his fellow drivers. According
to several drivers. the drunken
driver was going to be fired at the
end of the semester but was kept
on. even with his drinking problem.
because of his tenure and the need
for drivers.

“There is a wastepaper can
where. if you look in the right place
at night. you can see ctnpty beer
bottles." reports one source. "The
garage knows all about it."

When I mentioned the possibility
of a driver drinking on the job to
Acting Supervisor Gatltcn, he
replied:

“I know of no drivers who drink
on the job. If I was ever able to
catch a driver drinking. he wouldn't
work here; I would fire him im-
mediately. Neither l or my dispat-
cher [Art Burl) has ever been able to
catch a man intoxicated.”

The driver was reported to he so
intoxicated one evening that he
took the bus otrt of the garage.
drove it back lit. and parked it to go
home. He did not leave a word with
any of his fellow drivers that he had
dottc this. and his run was corn-
plctcly skipped.

“At least he had the sense to
know he couldn‘t drive." declared

one student. “It can get pretty hairy
out there on the road sometimes. It
is scary to think that he might drive
like that. I don't know what I
would do.”

“Every night becomes party
night after ll.” stated one driver.
"I don't know how some guys
could drive like that.“

The drunken driver. along with
several other drivers. has been ac-
cused by his working mates of leav-
ing early on a regular basis. The
weekend is one of his main runs.
and his 6:50 and ﬁnal Wellington
runs are. according to a source.
“always about ﬁve minutes early."
During the week, in the evening,
leaving early is a common custom
from the Wellington stop. Last
Wednesday evening I obsevercd a
bus at Northern Blvd. at 12:23. It
was supposed to leave the Well-
ington at 12:25.

In an attempt to keep drivers on
schedule. the gargagc has begun to
use a device called a Tacograph in-
stalled on all the buses. according to
acting Dispatcher Art Burt. The
device. called a Tacograph. consists
of a disk of graph paper artd a
recording pen that notes both driv-
ing spccd and stops. The graph
disks are good for twenty-four
hours, and are contained iii a lock-
cd clock device. It is the mechanics
rcsponsiblity to change these disks
every morning and deliver them to
tltc office. The Tacogrttplt cannot
be tampered with by the driver.
Although a number of tltcrn do not
work. the garage has recently
rcccivcd replacement graph
machines.

Burt admitted the garage was lax

on examining the graphs earlier this
semester. but said recently that they
are being examined after any com-
plaint. However. they do not seem
to be to effective when checking to
see if a driver leaves early. The
graph itself is only about four to
ﬁve inches round, and. over a
twenty-four hour period. detecting
a bus leaving even ﬁve minutes early
would be birtually impossible.
However. the graphs will detect any
skipped runs.

The phenomenon of the
“invisible bus“ is familiar to Well—
ington riders in the evening. when
they wait for ten minutes for the but
that never arrives. Although the
rttns are sometimes cut due to a lack
of drivers. this only appears when
drivers are critically short. There
are almost always enough drivers on
call to ﬁll in these runs. However.
almost daily :1 Wellington or Alum-
rti bus turns up “missing” at the cir-
clc or at tltc Wcllingtort according
to the published schedule. These
lapses are often cxplainable. yet the
garage is generally uncooperative to
student callers.

When the drivers come in for
their daily break. or dttring a driver
change. the schedule becomes a
force. The bttscs that have the witt-
dow sign “garage” are expected.
according to the schcdulc. to tnakc
a smooth transition from run to
run. This rarely works.

Although the system does work
well as a wltole. there are some pcr-
sonality problems.

The btrs system is a complex
machine itt its own right. with much
capacity for error. Yet. even a
model system has its faults. As one
student remarked. when discussing
tltc company on a btts ride home.
"Yea. it runs good. . . But I wish it
ran better!"

. Another rent-related complaint is
overtly exploited." according to
United Tenants of Albany (UTA)
worker Roger Markovlcs. “For the
same exact apartment a landlord
can charge students 5400 per
month. (which is more than he
would charge a family). I don't
know of any family who could af~
ford $400 a month for an apart-
ment."

Markovics explained. “This is

the students‘ ﬁrst time in the
market and they iust don't realize

the economics of it. ‘l‘lrere is much
money in the real estate business,
especially in the University area.
For that reason. landlords quickly
buy up available property. and then
milk students. They pack the
students into sub-divided apart-
ments and rake in the money."
Repairs are another cause of
many grievances. Markovics added.
“You have to call at least two or
three times before you can get
anything done," one student from
Washington Avenue complained.

For all its advantages. Mohawk
also has its problems. It operates at
a $13,000 annual deficit. but this is
It reasonable loss. according to UAS
General Manager E. Norbert
Zahm. Another expense is taxations
by surrounding school districts for
$5.000 yearly. This may be
eliminated iii the ftttttrc. however,
because of art ttppcal pcndirtg in the
courts to tlcsignatc Mohawk an
educational area. and therefore. tax

Welclt secs difficulty with this
idea. "The basketball learn does
not depend on the Basketball
Booster Club for its existence,"
Wclclr said. “It really doesn‘t pay
for very much. It helps in the
publication of tltc baskctball pro-

basketball program by arty means."

Despite tltc cl't‘orts. Earl stated
that “As far as I know. the decision

"There's no way that I know of

Ford. "They could still compete as

“Our team feels rigltt now that
