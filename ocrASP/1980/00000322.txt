Rib Harber

What, may I ponder. are the Albany police
doing lately?

I arose in a daze on Wednesday. typical of
my Albany dorm awakenings. but was startl-
ed into cognition when glancing down at a
copy of the Knickerbocker News.

Front page, lead story, t'ull spread
headlines, reading Police 'escort' their pay-
dates to jail, 7 arrested in vice raid.

Hmm...l read on.

Some neighborhood residents and business
people suspected 456 Delaware Ave. in
Albany was a front for a prostitution ring
several months before police began an in—
vestigation five weeks ago...a barber said
that...tlre schoolcrossing guard...an atten-
dent at the Mobil Service Station... "the girl
will meet you at the motel "...any service re-
quired by the customer... police armed with a
search warrant... pictures of 25 girls...

Holy tarnations, I believe we are living in
Victorian upstate New York.

Every few months, the police decide that
it's time for a fun lovin’ bust. the warrant.
the round-up. the arrests. call the papers.
cameras. stars, a sensation. “The police are
doing their job. god bless 'em,“ you can
almost here the average citizen utter.

Five weeks of investigation to nab seven
hookers centered in one ‘house of the even-
ing.’ oh come now! It ntay take five year: to
locate a psychopath raping student females.
but surely these typical busts are done within
hours.

The police. motivated by puritanical in-
terests. are conﬁrming the idea that prostitu-
tion is a societal evil, and in colaboration
with the local media. the party becomes a
sensation.

Some questions? What purpose does the
bust really have? Where does that place the
villa of Albany now? And does anyone
honestly believe that prostitution can be
eliminated?

Forget it. Where there's a demand. there is
a supply. and it should be as such. especially
when the arrangement harms neither partici-
pant.

Police and prostitutes have been battling
since the dark ages; it is clearly time for

workable laws and solutions.

Though not the happiest or most ideal type
of sexual relationship. both participants are
there voluntarily and both receive some type
of positive reinforcement from their interac-
tion. And there‘s nothing wrong with that.

Why don't the Albany Police spend aﬂve—
week probe trying to track down this Pine
Hills rapist(s)? His behavior is certainly sex-
ually and socially inappropriate. His tactic is
force and fear, the interaction is neither
voluntary; nor rewarding for the innocent
victim.

Prostitutes are still being arrested regularly
all across the nation; many bright college
students still believe that masturbation causes
mental and emotional harm. and the state of
Virginia will still prosecute anyone commit-
ting the hideous act of oral or anal sex. A
felony yet.

It all stems right back to the governing
backbone of America which still broadcasts
that sex is naughty.

Generally. the idea that you would like to
be in somebody's arms is anathema to a rigid-
commercial civilization.

If you can screw when you so desire. then
maybe you won't listen to the president. If
you can be free where you live. nobody can
tell you what to do. The way to tell people
what to do is to make them ashamed of what
they've got between their legs and how they
want to use it. Make them guilty of it.

Stereotypes about sexual behavior. once
established in the medical and social world.
prove very difficult to remove because of
their vested interest in the status quo.

The creation of a specialized. despised.
and punished role of the prostitute keeps the
bulk of society pure and pleased.

Well...the prostitutes covered their embar-
rassed faces as the cameras clicked. the
rcports were completed. papers sold. and
promotions assured.

Congratulations Albany police for your
ﬁne investigative harrassment. and you too
Kniclt News. for pleasing so many of the
town’s laid-back readers.

You all deserve a ﬁne hand...or leg...or
ass...

Bad Campaigners

To the Editor:

We are writing to complain of an incident

which occurred recently in connection with
the SA elections. As freshmen, we decided to
get involved in _this election. and started
working for the candidate of ottr choice in
the vice-presidential race. Part of this work
involved hanging posters in different dorms.
On the first night of the election. we heard
that many of the posters on lndian Quad had
been tortt down. so we went to replace them.
In one of tltc dorms we met one of Frank
Baitman’s supporters. who informed us that
it would be useless to hang a poster there,
since it was Baitman's ltall. and everybody
who lived there would be voting for him. We
replied that we would hang it anyway. and
take our chances. We were then told that it
would probably be ripped dowrt.
Out of curiottsity, wc rctttrttcd ten minutes
later. and. sure enough. the poster was no
longer on the bulletin board. Across the hall.
we saw. through the open door of the sup-
portcr‘s suiteroont (which. incidentally. is
also Frank Baitntan's sttiteroom) the poster
lying crumpled on top of the trash can.

We are very disappointed and shocked that
this type of thing could happen in what we
had assumed would be a fair. honest. and
opctt election. All the candidates should be
allowed equal chanccs for exposure, whether
they are on an opponent‘s “home turf" or
not. and we are distressed that this is not the
case. The ASP may have deemed Frank Bait-
matt the "moral" candidate. but the same

 

 

ccrtainly cannot be said of some oi hi» strpv
