'l'he Last
Laugh,

“What would the world be like if I rode on a beam of light?"
— Albert Einstein

Maybe I‘m tired, Of production nights. Of arguments. Of
constant Rat dinners. Oi falling asleep in classes i feel
privileged to attend. Oi not being able to read a novel since
August. Of being away from home. Of having a friend who
has become a sometimes friend. Of not having the time to
have fun. Of school. Oi ASP. Of life.

But 1'" miss it. 1'" miss it when l'm gone, when it's all
frayed newspapers, and ghostly faces. not quite right
names. 1'” remember the people. i must. They have done
something to me up on the third floor. i feel like Dorothy
leaving Oz. All this sentimental stuff makes me sick. Life
goes on. Who cares?

But life doesn't always go on, you leave a place, and you
leave n part of yourself behind. You leave people and you
leave a part of yourself with them, And you take a part of
them too. You affect things; they affect you.

Aspects has been an accomplishment for me. That I could
work with such talented people is a gift from life.

l'm getting nostnlgic again. it‘s my schizophrenia. Well,
l'm no good ill being noble or gracious so ill tusi bow out of
the show and move on. i love Aspects, though. despite
everything. l'm n lousy sentimentalist, i guess. Goodbye
Aspects, I'll bury my magic book in you and leave without
regrets (maybe n few) and I'll try hard to remember
everything.

I don't know what my life's all about yet. but if Aspects
with all its deceptions and magiciiasa' all confused, provok-
ed, tin/.ed. .unnzed, or amused you, then 1'" feel justified.
Now i really feel ill, it's so hard to just end. To just end. Let's
close our eyes and count to ten. When you open them
again, presto chango, nlmicndabrn, the dream will be over.

l'll be gone.

Cotter Concept by Rob Gt'ulmion

Spiritual Graffiti

“Our revels now are ended, these our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits, and

Are melted into air. into thin air:

And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,

The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,

And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff

As dreams are made on; and our little life

Is rounded with a sleep." _ Prospero

“The eye of man hath not heard. the ear of man
hath not seen. man's hand is not able to taste, his
tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what

my dream was." — Bottom
