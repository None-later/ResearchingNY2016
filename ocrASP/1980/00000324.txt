ambivalence to people. quality. arid coheston.
'The committee-type decrsion-rnakiiig Within
the state too often yields policy that is seriously
confused and fragmented Tlte state
‘egislature has been an albatross that tlte
University system has beeii urtable to influence
since tlte belt-tightening politics of the 70's
took hold Llnforiuni‘ttely. power and money

year's tuition hike to “go pick apples.” While it
is trite that Rockefeller's build-by-orgasm at-
titude is better off buried. it doesn't iustily the
low priority tltat education is beiitg assigned
now that dollars are scarce and the ac-
cumulated layers of bureaucratic fat are being
trimmed. Ultimately, the student suffers. it's
sad when the institution that awards hint his
degree is drastically different from the one in
which he enrolled eight semesters ago.
What emerges from the legislative machine
under this type of stress is policy that would be
laughable were we not so often the object of
the joke. The only thing that grows in this type
of environment is paperwork and ad-
ministrative departments. Why, you may ask.
does Syracuse University, a priuate school, get
a domed stadium courtesy of the Empire State
while we can't get a fieldliouse or a Chemistry
Ph.D.? Hell, our football team is better than
Division I Syracuse's anyway. . .Again, talk
of program cuts drifts up from the Capitol. it's
no wonder Governor Carey’s pleas for alumni
donations go largely ignored ~ aren't people
fed up wttli the way their tax dollar is spent?
Of course, pragmatically speaking, we have
received a pointed education in the endless

 

 

 

fers students a multitude of routes to develop-
ing their minds This institutional atmosphere
has provided a contrast by which we have
come to appreciate the value of the people
around us.

Hopefully. the state will show foresight iii
allotiiig funds in the future Those of you
returning to New York City next week have
the opportunity to view sortie recent
bureaucratic spending firsthand You might
want to take advantage of the “verity-seven
urinals the Thruway Autlioiity saw fit to install
at the Sloatsbiiig rest stop. Actually. they'ie
about as appropriate a testiment as there is to
where high-level governmental decision mak-
ing takes place

Just as the SUNY system must rise to the
challenge of adequately providing for each iii-
divtdual student iii the coming years. so must
we meet the challenge of providing for
ourselves enough to preserve our individuality
in an increasingly monolithic world. With each
passing day. the value of individual human
freedoms seems to become more and more
subordinate to economic interests. With fifty
Americans dying a slow death in lran for Exxr
on. Mobil. and Texaco. one need not be
especially perceptive to recognize tlial human
life is cheap when measured against profit, in
stltutions have grown to the point where they
cannot deal with aitythtng so minute as one
single person, That is. unless you happen to
owe them money. llt that case. It's often startl-
ing how an entity the size of the phone com»
party can move so quickly and effectively. But
did you ever try to avoid paying for that
strange, 57—minute call to Tanglers that they
insist you made while on vacation? You're
treated like Carlo Gambino asking for clemen-
cy.
However, there is another, more insidious
evil threatening the individual: standardization

the knowledge that it could very well be your
last . . . and you might discover the power
arid knowledge within you. Go otit and have
yourself a good time ~— if they seek to sup-
press you. well. then to hell with them if they
can't take a joke. You don't really ltave to
please anyone other than yourself.

And so. as the PhD. programs disappear
from the catalogue. remember the larger.
more insidious pressure gnawtng away on our
society itself. The signs are all there: economic
castration by inultl-national corporations to the
tune of David Rockefeller and the slteiks.
political impotence. underscored by Tweedles
Dum attd Dee searchiitg for the right media-
mix iii this election year; all the while iiillation
undermines the Great American Dream.
Where are we to turn? Are we to believe in
Laverne and Shirley. the Ford Pinto and
designer jeans? it's no irony that the most
celebrated alumnus of this school is a thief
