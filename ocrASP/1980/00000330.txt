we could settle our differences.

Everytlme we think of you we have
to laugh. It's great to know that
there's other craz people out there
somewhere but 0 we have to et
stuck living with them. Who‘s go ng
to catch you when you fall In the
door the next time? And who's go-
Ing to warn us of the next fire I,
guess we've had our laughs (rolls) In
the cafe - you know the place you go
to late at night to study for nothing.
And next time you stare up‘at the
tower In amazement (or were you
looking for someone), try to
remem er the escapades In It. And
how could we forget when you went
bike riding In the rain to prove that
bike brakes do not work In the rain.
And then the bike rusted. And Pizza
Hut. And Perkins. And we're gonna
miss you. And don't forget the litter
bag In your car.

All our.love. ELC Pres. and Vice.

Thank you for a great year of fun

ng.

Well I guess this personal Is a lot
different than the one that ap
peared last year, but what can I

again a lot of time has passed. I
sometimes think that ever thin is
comin along really well ut t on
somet ing comes up and I have to
think that we haven‘t come as far as
I thought. I uses it really doesn't
pay to think ut then aga n neither
does this Job. I hope this summer Is
as good as I’ve prayed for It to be
because I don't want to have to
grab onto what I can scramble for.
ve done enough scrambling. 50
starting over - l'm sorry. Can we go
on from here? '
