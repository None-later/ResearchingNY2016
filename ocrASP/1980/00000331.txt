Housing Problems

cont/nued from page rrlns.

sure repairs will be done is to get
agreements in writing with an ap-
proximate completion deadline. "A
verbal agreement is hard to en-
force," she said, “so nothing gets
done."

Students complain about heating
as well. Albany's Housing Code re-
quires that "buildings inhabitaled
from September 15—June 15 must
be provided with heating equipment
designed to maintain the
temperature at a minimum 65 to 68
degrees."

Despite the problems and rising
expense, Sellgson said Albany hous-
lng is still a “seller's market" and
will remain so because of short sup-
plies ol rooms and high student de-
mand t‘or off-campus living.

$2.50 Rug

continued front page seven
Pepper. "Titcy took the rug away
really quick. Titcy didn't‘give it a
chance to dry up."

i’cppcr also said that the rug is
"woriit pretty much nothing," and
that it had "rips on every stair. We
heard a rttmor they were going to
switch the rug anyway." Pepper
feels that tile students should only
be responsible for the market value
ol‘ the rug ul'tcr fifteen years of
depreciation.

"Ii seams to me they (the ad-
ministration) are out to screw us.
We have some sort of a reputa-
liort," l’cppcr said.

According to SA Attorney Jack
Luster, the $2,500 is probably an in-
l'lulcd l'igurc because it "is not It l‘tlir

 

boon

rttitrkct value." He said that the
figure estimated did not take into
rtccotmt iltc dcptccirrtcd vrllnc of tits

As for SUNYA, O'i.cary sees the
emphasis on quality teaching as be—
ing it central point. He also mcn-
iioncd many other individual
aspects ol' the university which
could be improved.

The key to lltc development is
planning — something which was
lacking irt lltc '60's and caused
much ol' the proltlcrtts of tile '70'5.
[Even if budget cuts are forccustcd.
it is the opinion of the Chancellor
and the President tititt they can be
