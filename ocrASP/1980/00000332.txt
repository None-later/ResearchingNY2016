Rugby Club
Takes Second

By Mike Naclerlo

This past Saturday. the Albany
State rugby club took an intpressive
second place at the Itltaca Invita-
tional Tournament. This sirotig
showing came one week after tlte
Danes dropped a disappoitttiiig
14-13 loss to Colgate.

The Danes opened tip the Ithaca
tournament Saturday morning
against the ltost team. Itltaca. From
the outset Albany had a hit of dif-
ficulty getting started. but in the
end the Danes came away with art
Iii-3 victory.

The Danes second match of the
day came against Springfield — an
extremely tough squad. But the
Danes were ready for the contest.
and handed Springﬁeld ti slinging
22-0 defeat. It was in tltis ganic that
Albany put everything together.
The backs and the scrunirtters were
impressive. with the Albany scoring
cottiirtg front Jim Johnson. 'I‘ci'ry
Walsh. Mike Naclerio. and Steve
Shoert.

Next came tltc championship
garite. The Hartford rtrgby club and
the Albany squad took the ﬁeld.
and many itt attendance felt that the
Danes ourplaycd their opponents.
However. the Duties received some
questionable calls front tire referees.
who admitted later that tltc had call
enabled Hartford to score. The
game ended with the Danes going
dowti to a 4-0 setback.

The tournament boosted
Albany’s overall record to 6—2 for
the season, as the Danes scored 127
points iii the eight games while only
giving up 2‘). lriclttded in this irri-
pressive season were fotir shutouts
by the Danes. This strong season
came despite many new and inex-
perienced players this year. The
Danes lost just one player because
of injuries — Jim Johnson — arid
Albany certainly made their
presence known to every team they
faced.

Lacrosse 1980 for Albany‘s
Danes was like a coaster. or a stock.

(behind Fredonia). and captured

Meanwhile, the Bob Munsey-
coached track and ﬁeld team finish-
ed a disappointing seventh in the
SUNYACs. Despite this.
sophomore sensation Howie
Williams has qualiﬁed for the na-
tionals in the 200 meter dash. as has
Mike Sayers in the 10,000 meter
run. A lack of weight men was the
key to the trackmen's problems, yet
they still finished at 5-4 for the spr-
ing.

The men‘s volleyball team was
extremely successful. even though a
rebuilding year was planned. Not-
cliing a 16-6 record. they went far-
ther in the ECVL playoffs than arty
other Albany volleyball squad.
Coach 'l‘ed Earl noted that. with the
first string in. Albany was
unbeaten. and that the losses were
when the second line players were iri
(dtie to injuries. etc.).

Ron White's swimmers had a 7-4
record. and boasted the number
one ranked 400 yard medley relay
team in the state (Steve Bonawitz.

Joe Shore. Frank Heter. and Kevin
Ahern).

In Albany State wrestling. the
name was Paul Hornbach. The 177
pound grap'pler went undefeated
throughout most of the season. and
was tabbed All-American. Under
first year coach Joe Demeo. the
Danes had a 9-10 record.

An attempt to breathe new life in-
to a stagnating program brought in
Rick Skeel from Ohio as head
baseball coach. Optimism has been
the key word for Skeel in his first
year as a Dane. but misjudgment of
talent has resulted in a frustrating
year. Going 5-6 in the fall and 7-9
this spring with one game left. Skeel
is not happy with his teams' perfor-
mance.

“I tltink these kids have had the
best education of their lives this
year." said Skeel. “I felt that we
had more ability there. We lost a lot
of ballgartics that we absolutely
should'vc won."

Mike Motta's varsity lacrosse
team. rebounding from a 3-9 cam-
paign in 1979. is 6-5 with two con-
tests to go.

On the other side of things.
women athletes had. as a whole. a
banrtcr year at Albany. Seven oftlie
ten women‘s teams had winning
records.

For the second year in a row, the
women's volleyball team was the
top female sport. Posting an 11-6-1
record. the Pat Dwyer-coaehed
squad was the number four seed in

‘x xx

the 1979 Division 11 NYSAIAW
(New York State Association of In-
tercollegiate Athletes for Women)
Tournament.

The biggest turn-around of any
Albany State Sport was by the
women’s soccer club. After a
dismal 0-6-1 inaugural season in
1978, new coach Amy Kidder whip-
ped her squad into a competitive
unit, ﬁnishing at 6-3-2. The newest
edition to the women's inter-
collegiate program. the booters
need two more seasons at the club
level before it can be made a varsity
sport.

Lee Rhcnish’s softball team
hosted tltc NYSAIAW Tourna-
ment. and proved they belonged
there by ﬁnishing fourth. Con-
sisting primarily of freshmen and
sophomores. they are 9-5 with the
season not quite over.

The women's tennis team, coach-
ed by Peggy Mann, went 4-3 in the
fall and. without captain Lisa
Denenmark, had a 3-2 spring
record.

A Casey Reynold-coached
women's cross country squad had a
7~3 record. won the Capital District
meet, got third itt both the Albany
and Hartwick lrivitatiortttls. and
was seventh iii the Eastern AIAW
regional trteet. Sophomore Leslie
Price and freshman Diarte Kircliot‘f
qualiﬁed for the AIAW Division III
nationals. with Price finishing 30th
iii a field of 200.

Spring track for women saw

Albany notch a 7-2 record. Sue
Kalled (100 and 400 meter Hurdles)
and Chris Gardner (5000 meter run
both performed well in the
regionals for Barb Palm’s runners.

Pat Rogers’ synchronized swim-
mers had a perfect 5-0 record. and
had a commendable showing in the
nationals.

The gymnastics team posted a 6-9
mark, but the story there was
freshman Elaine Glynn. who finish-
ed 13th in the AlAW Division III
nationals (all-around competition).
Glynn is tlte ﬁrst Albany gymnast
to reach the national finals.

Rounding out the program. a
revitalized women’s basketball
team finished 6-13 while Sarah
liingham’s swimmers were 4-9.

So. even wiltout a national cham-

extent.

"A healthy athletic program is
one that is competitive internally
(for positions on art team) and corn-

Ford, and he feels that this is occur-

be a goal for all our teams." ltc cort-

along the line. success will eotrte to

Albany State.

Not too many things are constant on the ASP. especially person-
nel. More 50, section editors tend to come and go. The work load is
heavy. the pressure is sometimes great and, after a time (often a short
time) some editors decide that they’ve had enough.

Well, for the last two years, there is one thing that has been cons-
tant —— Paul Schwartz.

After three semesters as Sports Editor (and one as Associate). Paul
is giving up his post. He'll still do some coverage for the ASP. but
he’ll primarily write for a local newspaper.

The sports scene is a changing thing also (especially at a relatively
small school like Albany). and Paul has done his best to stay on top
of it, and bring it to us. the students. in the best possible way he
knows —— through efﬁciency. organization. and that knack of doing
things that comes only from experience.

When the Great Dane football team went to the NCAA semi-ﬁnals
in 1977. Albany head football coach Bob Ford remarked that the
Seligson-Schwartz duo spent as much time in the football ofﬁce as
the coaches. preparing for the game.

When the Albany varsity basketball team went to Danville, Ken-
tucky in l979 and Potsdam iii 1980 for the NCAA regional playoffs.
Paul was there. not only as a reporter. but also as a top Dane fan.

Many speak of the apathy that SUNYA students have towards
athletics. Well, to coin a cliche. Paul Schwartz doesn't Iiavc an
apathetic bone in his body. and he‘s tried to transfer Iris enthusiasm
about Albany sports to us. the students. through his writing.

Wait a minute. Listen to what the people that Paul has worked
with have to say:

“Paul falls into a lortg litre of people who ltavc worked iii the ASP
sports arena who Iiave worked above and beyond."

“He's just a touch of class."

— Albany Athletic Director Iiol) Ford

"1 think Paul is art outstanding young titan."

“I wlslt all sportswriters were like him."

-- Allimty lit-ml l)tl.\'l\’t.’ll)tlll couch Dick Sorters

"I think the ASP hits never had as comprehensive coverage of all
teariis as they've had this year. . .ditc to l’attl's irilcttsc coverage of
all athletic events."

"Professional." . , . .
— Sports Infortttrttrott [)Ift't'lUl‘ (fury Swat/mg

Paul has taught its. the students. art awful lot. I‘ve learned things
like ltow to lay otit ti page and ltow to write a lead. bitt as sltidertts
and, riiorc importantly, Albany State sports fans. I think l’aul lttis
shown us class. pride. arid what sttidcrtt apathy definitely is not.

So Patti. as you branch out itito the lifestyle yotr so desire. I know
that on Tuesdays and Fridays, when I pick tip the ASP at ltritclt or
dinner and look at the brick page. sortietliitig might be missing —— that
Schwartz-tress. But. hopefully. it'll still be there somehow. _

Well. when it comes dowit to it. I guess the guys from Attlieuscr-
lluscli said it best: I’orrl. this titres/oni'ott.

Nelson and cohorts Warren Wrey.
Scott Cort, Mark Waterstram. and
others were hopefuin earning
theirs.

And the attack worked. The
Danes scored well this year. They
had ups and downs with man-ups

held their own and the shots got off

And if yoti look at LllL' starts (a

erratic, btit they still pulled a ‘ll' in
my grade book. The face-offs get a
‘C‘. biit the defense its a whole

arid the clutch bench matches this as
well.

The word being circulated all

and it certainly held true until the

Brockport had trouble beating New
Haven the other day; a team with a
bench of 5 and a coach who seemed
like he was out on a Hollywood
