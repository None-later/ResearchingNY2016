By Paul Schwartz

I’m sure he’s forgotten it by now.
but there’s no way I have. You see,
it really didn't mean all that muclt.
It was just after last year's Albany-
lthaca football game —— the one on
ABC-TV — and the Dane's coach.
Bob Ford, was basking in the in-
credibly hard-fought victory. _

I went over to congratulate him.
and he smiled a tired but satisfied
smile. and said, “You know. you
guys worked as hard for this as We
did." .
Then I smiled. That tirade me feel
good. And if there’s one way to
describe my three year association
with Ford and another coaclt —
Dick Saucrs —— and both the foot-
ball and basketball teams. and all
the ASP stuff. it’s that it made me
feel good.

true. I felt lousy sometimes too.
Like when I had an 18-hour bus

grumble over a one point Dane loss.
Or when I was forced to sit and
watch as that Ithaca team got
revenge this year with a 40 poirtt
blowout that wasn't quite that
close.

But mostly. it‘s been satisfying,
and after covering those two sports
for a few years. there are some
things that I've gotten frotn thcm:
*Therc was Ford walking with its
around King Point‘s beautiful carn-
pus. calmly explaining his feelings
on his team’s 14-8 loss in the first
game of last season. That taught the
something about Ford.
tThcrc was Sauch saying “this
team continucs to surprise me"
after almost every game this year.
and then calling the Dane‘s 21-6
season "my most surprising team."

 

OK. I realize that’s not really,

*Kcvin Kcttnc. who was the cap-
tain of Albany‘s 1977-78 basketball
team. cricd aftcr tltc Danes \von tltc
liCAC Upstate Tournament. He
was a senior. I was a frcslnnatt. and
was wondering wlty he was crying.
* Albany was trailing Norwich l4-O
at halftime a year ago. Tltcn
halfback Levi Louis got moving.
arid his moves were good enough to
produce a l9-l4 victory.

*A year latcr. Sartre two teams.
Albany is undefeated, but as I sit in
the pressbox. I write in my
notebook Norwich 25. Albany 22.
Then I slant rtty pen down hard on
the table. A minute later. I quickly
retrieve my pert and scribble Il’trls‘lr
rolls for TD. Albany 28. Norwich
25.

     
  
  

ii rerncmbcr Hamilton coming ill
to University (iym two years ago
with a huge winning streak. The
Danes, meanwhile. were just told
they were not pickcd for the
playoffs. They were upset.
Hamilton left that night with it one
game losing streak. .
*And when Potsdam came to
Albany this year. they were Il»().
They beat the Danes in overtime.
liut. it was the most jam-packed.
enthusiastic. frantic crowd I've ever
seen irt Urtivcrsity (iym. \Vll' u
Potsdam run out. the place booed
like cr'ary. When Albany came out,
they went crazy. [I was electric. I'll
remember that for a wltilc.

*Jack Sicdlccki was fascinating to
listen to. He could cmlain cvcr

 

 

 
  
 
  
 

detail of tire football squttd's
dct'cnse. After all. he wtts the dcl'cn-
sivc coordinator.

*Sauers seemed to be able to cx- '

plain ('l't'ljl'l’lfllg there was to know
about basketball. But after his
team blew a lead and a gatnc to
l'lrtttsbnrgh last year. Strut-rs said to
his son. who was crying a little.
"It‘s iusl not that important." 'I'lutt
taught me something about Strucrs.

l;

 
  

irl remember nttrnbcr 21 coming lri
during that Ithaca game and kick-
ing a 45-yard field goal to lead
Albany to the win. Number _21 was
Arango.

*l cart still see tltc bttskct shaking
aftcr Kelvin Joncs‘ slam dttnk
against Iltimilton.

*llratl Aldrich's pass is still
desperately ﬂoating dowrtﬁeld at
Blocker Stadium. and Scott Lusher
is still making a diving catch to set
up Arango's kick.

*I wish I‘d seen Ray Ccsare's short
jump shot that beat Jersey City in
the Elmira Invitational. l was in my
room. busy going crazy by the radio
when I heard it.

H only heard about Sam
Haliston's 99 yard run two years
ago. I missed it by about a minute.
*I can still see Barry Cavanaugh‘s
ill-fated hehind—tltc—back pass to no
one against Union two years back. I
wish I could forch it.

* liut I'm glad I remember
Cavanaugh‘s 34 poirtts against
CW, Post.

*I got a kick out of watching Cal
l-‘lynt go into his act before every
Albany kickoff.

*l-‘ord's voice after a game was
nothing but a hoarse, cracking
whisper. But he still always
answered all my questions.

H can still remember when Gary
Swutling called to tell me the Danes
were being sent to Kentucky.

*My strunttch still remembers the
hospitality room in Kentucky.
*Aftcr the Dane basketball learn
bcttt Cortland. I didn’t mind phon-
ing in my story from some bar in
Cortland.

*John Veruto might still be in

at the Cadets as they warmed up.
at was there when Sauers got his
400m win.

Artd next year. I'll be back in the
stands watching the Danes. They
