"It was sort of a mixed year."

. That's what Albany State
Athletic Director Bob Ford said
about
sports season. .

“i think we had some, great ac-
complishments and some frustra-
' tions," said Ford, noting the per-
formances of the coaches and
athletes as commendable. But Ford
considered the off-the-field aspects
of intercollegiate athletics. namely
“a loss of resources," as the major
cause of the frustration.

1979-80 certainly was a mixed
year for Albany State sports. There
were occasions when Dane squads
were considered among the best in
the nation. Then something would
happen (like an upset or a drubbing
at the hands of an arch-rival) and
Albany would drop out of
cveryone’s minds. Other teams
weren‘t even considered worthy of
serious consideration (“rebu.lding"
it’s called). and then comes the stir-
prise — a winning season or just a
few great perfomances against top
competition.

In all sports, though, there is that
one great equalizer — the won-loss
record. With six contests remaining
on the schedule. the 26 Albany
teams have posted a collective
record of 208-143, with 6 lies.

National recognition -— two
words that plague small college
coaches from coast to coast. Take
out the second word of that term
and replace it with
"championship," and the eyes of
those coaches light up with the
dreams of what could be. Two
Dane squads received their highest
mid-season national rankings this
year. The two “big time" sports
(football and basketball) made it to
the top l0 in their respective nation-
wide polls.

Severely hurt by the graduation
of both the offensive and defensive
lines, the Dane football team, ac-
cording to Ford (also head football
coach), lacked great speed. great
quickness, team strength. and the
great passing attack necessary to
realize the goal that the coach feels
every team has —— that national
championship.

The big pre-season surprise for
Ford was the returns of premier
defensive tackle Steve Shoen
(Capitol District Player of the Year
in 1977). defensive end Eric

Singletary.

The Year In Review

and halfback Sam
l-laliston. All had taken a year off
for various reasons. but were now
back. much to the pleasure of the
Dane staff.

For the Danes, the name of the
game was defense. Albany refused
to yield the goal line for the first
two games. shutting out Hobart
(10-0) and Southern Connecticut
State (20-0). Against Brockport.
Albany's “bend but not break"
philosophy paid off, as the Golden
Eagles netted 3|] total yards. but
could only muster 6 points. The

 

 

 

 

Danes went ll quarters without giv-
ing up a point.

Next catne Buffalo, and sweet
revenge for Albany against the
Bulls (who. by beating the Danes
l5-8 in I978. knocked them out of
playoff consideration) with a 40-l2
victory. Brooklyn College followed.
and was treated with sitnilar
disregard. and were the victims of
the third Dane shutout. 56-0.

Titus. the first part of Albany’s
season ended ~-~ the easy part. The

next two games would make or
break the Dane dream of an NCAA
playoff bid.

The Norwich Cadets; second na-
tionally in total offense (488.1 yards
per game); second nationally in
scoring offense (39.1 points per
game): top rushing offense in
America. Division lll (398.3 yards
per game); all behind an offensive
line that averaged 230 pounds per
man. lrresistable force meets im-
movable object. Ranked. fourth in
the East before the game, Albany
improved that to fourth ' “1
(third in the East) after the come-
from—behind 28-25 victory over the
Cadets. lthaca was waiting. . .and
ready. Boy. were they ready.

Several Danes were hurt in the
Norwich game. but several players
do not 40 points make, and Albany
was sent reeling 46-6. the worst loss
in the seven-year history of Albany
State varsity football. lthaca would
go on to win the national cham-
pionship.

From then on. it was downhill for
the Danes. who fell to Fordham and
Springfield back-to-back by scores
of 35-28,and 31-0. respectively. The
Albany dream was broken. with
their final record at 6-3.

Albany's other source of national
recognition athletically was in
basketball. where head coach Dick
Sauers was embarking on his 25th
season in that position.

Two things awaited Sauers — one
he liked, one he did not: A new
SUNYA divisional arr

points. After taking the next four
contests (including two SUNYAC
games). Albany lost to Stony Brook
in the opener of that team's invita-
tional tournament.

ln front of a literally shoulder-to-
shoulder crowd in University Gym.
the top ,two rattked Division lll
hoop squads in the state (the Bears
were first) squared off for 45
ntinutcs of tense. dramatic, basket-
ball that a master of suspense
couldn’t have mapped out better.

After a missed Pete Stanis’t free
throw with 13 seconds left in over-

 

 

which the coach felt could exclude a
deserving learn frotn a playoff berth
was the latter. The good news was
that guard Winston Royal (a key
performer who sat the l978-79
season out in order to captain the
Dominican Republic national team
iii the Pan-Am Games) was return-
ing to the Albany llnc-up.

The season opener against Kings
College of Pennsylvania saw the
Danes win. 79-69. behind guard
Rob Clune‘s team season high 29

time. Potsdam rushed the ball up-
cottrt, and Maurice Woods, short
jumper, made the score 70-68,
Potsdam. Bear guard Ed .lachim
stole the inbounds puss. icing the
Potsdam victory.

Wins over Ouconta. Cortland.
and Utica brought Suuers' career
victory total to 399. With the 70-56
defeat of Pluttsburgh came nutnbcr
400 for Satters. making him only
the fourth Division lll coach to
reach that plateau.

hm’ents, Frustrations

Another win brought Albany to
Oneonta. where the Danes hadn't
been victorious since l97l. The
eighties held nothing new, and the
Red Dragons upset Albany, 63-62
in overtime. Division lll power
Hartwick handed the Danes their
second consecutive loss, 71-63.

Potsdam and Plattsburgh were
the only obstacles to a Dane
SUNYAC playoff shot. Albany
won them both. 88-86,and 73-68,
respectively.

Despite getting third in the con-
ference chatnpionships. Albany
received a bid to the NCAA Nor-
theast Regional in Potsdam.

After beating a powerful St.
Lawrence five in the opening
round, 75~66. Albany fell apart in
the last seven minutes of the cham-
pionsltip game- rubber match with
Potsdam. and was eliminated,
87—72.

"That was the toughest one of
all." said Suuers. But he was still
satisfied with his squad‘s seasonal
performance. “The team did what
it had to do when it needed to do it,
and that's the sign ofa good team."
With a final record of 2L6 (the
most Albany wins since 1961), it’s
difficult to disagree.

Albany‘s junior varsity basket-
ball team was a big surprise. Coach-
ed by Steve Kopp. the Danes
romped to a 16-4 record and the
highest winning percentage of any
men‘s sport, despite quittings. in—
juries. and tragedy. The jayvce's
two top players. Mike Gaines and
Mike Gatto. are top candidates for
next season's varsity.

The 1979 soccer season was one
that could be termed "frustrating."
Finishing at 6-5 with 1 tie. head
coach Bill Schieffelin felt that a
poor recruiting year and key in-
juries left Albany with an inex-
perienccd team facing a demanding
schedule which included three Divi-
sion l squads.

“Those are the biggest factors
right there." said Schieffelin in
reference to the causes of his team's
record. “Some of our'youngsters
just weren't experienced enough to
play against our competition." he
continued.
> Of those ﬁve losses. four were by
one goal and the one that wasn't
(3—l to Binghamton) could've easily
been," said Schieffelin.
