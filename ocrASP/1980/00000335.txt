Eight months ago. the mention of
the name John Anderson in conver-
sation most often provoked a
“John who?" from all but the most
politically aware. But the lilinois
Congressman's name was obviously
familiar to the some 4.000 students
who came to hear him speak on the
podium yesterday.

; N€W§ FEATUR€

—______—

Wirether highly interested in or
simply well-briefed on student
lf-sllL'S, Anderson discussed his: op-
position to a peacetime draft. his
support of increased financial aid to
students. and his disbelief in “the
winnahility ofa nuclear war." all of
which were well-received by the au-
dience. Anderson said he wanted to
“welcome students back to the
political process.

 

 

Anderson Brings Show To Town.

“Your generation probably has
more at stake in this election of
1980 than any other group." he ad-
ded.

Although tlte Congressman’s late
arrival. a poor sound system, apd
an unexpected upsurge of the
podium fountain somewhat marred
his speech technically. the crowd
seemed interested in what Anderson
had to say; his comment that
“Ronald Reagan is irrelevant"
brought cheers front the students.

SUNYA was the third stop of a
series of colleges at which Anderson
is campaigning. Yet he denied at a
later press conference at the South
Mall that his campaign is geared
mainly toward students.

“i would hope that my comments
at the colleges would be reported
and read by others." he said. “But
i certainly will not be speaking ex-
clusively to student audiences."

if insisting that his campaign is

not solely student-oriented, Ander-
son’s statements to the press
centered on his ﬁnancial aid plan
for higher education. Emphasizing
higher education as “an important
investment." Anderson outlined a
financial aid proposal that included
increased Basic Educational Oppor-
tunity. Grant (BEOG) allocations. a
“rational, equitable. and widely
available". loan program for
middle-income families. and a

Merit Scholarship program.’
Alluditrg to past cutbacks to the
SUNY and CUNY systems.’Ander-
son stated that “an Anderson ad-
ministration is committcd to rev'ers-
ing the decade-long decline in sup-

port for higher education."
- Anderson professed to be
“progressive to changes that have
taken place in our society." Cert
tainly his own issue positions have
not always been consistent. Some

SUNYA Bus ServicegBeduced

 

Wellington

_h_v Susan Milligan

The loss of two SUNYA bus
drivers, due to University budget
cuts. has resulted in the changing of
both Alumni and Wellington 'htls
schedules. according to Physical
Plant Director Dennis Stevens.

Wellington buses. which
previously traveled from the Ad-
ministration Circle all the way to
the 'l‘railways bus terminal. now
leaves from Draper Hall only, en-
circling the South Mall but not
stopping at the Trailways station.
Alumni buses will no longer slop at
undesignatcd stops on request, as
was mandated last year by the
President's Task Force on
Women's Safety.

Although Stevens feels the
schedule changes are necessary to
give students the best bus service
possible in light of the staff cuts.
SA president Sue Gold and several
of the bus drivers expressed
dissatisfaction with the new
schedule.

“Dennis Stevens met with Brian
(SA vice—president Levy) and me
concerning the schedules last
month, said (iold, “but we didn't

have any say in it at all — he just
showed it to us and basically said
‘what do you think »— it's going irr-
to print tornorrow.‘ We had no irr-
put at all."

According to Stevens, riders on
Alumni buses “increased by 20 per-
cent last year" and more Alumni
buses were needed to give students
adequate service. Since the Plant
Department lost two bus drivers.
the gap was filled by decreasing the
Wellington service to one shuttle
bus that completes its trip in one
half hour.

“i don‘t like the loss of the posi-
tions either." said Stevens. “That's
80 hours less service. ilut we needed
to bolster the Alumni schedule with
increased frequency."

(,iold feels that the greatest pro-
blem concerning the less frequent
Wellington bus service is women’s
safety.

“Draper Hall is not located in a
good section of town." she said,
“and many women will be waiting
there at night for possibly as long as
one half hour waiting for a connec—
tion between an Alumni and a Well—
ington bus. Especially considering

Stevens said he recognizes the
problem. but added that "the
longest \vail anyone will have is 25
minutes" and that “students can
wait for the hits inside Draper 

“it will eventually become clear
to students which has they should
take to catch a particular Well-
ington bus." Stevens said.

The change most angering
students scents to be the elimination
of the Trailways terminal stop.
Sttrdents going home for a weekend
or for the holidays must now either
walk down State Street or find
alternate transportation.

Dorm Rates Increase $150

by Bruce W. Fox

Room rates will rise more than
$600 over the next few years if the
SUNY Board of Trustees goes
ahead with a plan to cut off all sub-
sidies to dormitories.

The new plan was originally
unveiled by Chancellor Clifton
Wharton at a closed meeting of the
trustees in May. Wharton's pro—
posal for an initial $150 rate hike
this year was both introduced for
the first time and approved at lltttl
meeting.

As a result of the initial hike.
students who paid $800 last year for
normal occupancy will now pay
$950, or approximately $119 per
month.

SUNY Vice (.‘hauccllor for
Finance and Business Harold
Spindler cites inflation and lack of
state support as chicl reasons for
the hike. According to Spindler. the
SUNY system was running on a $60
million deficit in May. despite the

$22.3 million reappropriated by the
legislature in April.

Spindlcr said he supports rate
hikes since SUNY is “the only ma-
jor state trniversity without self-
sufficicnt dormitories" and since a
dorm hike “affects only one—third
of all SUNY students." The only
alternative. said Spirtdler, is cutting
faculty.

State subsidies for dormitories
last year amounted to $20 million.
or $400 per bed, he said.

According to SASU Communica-
tions Director Paul Snook, Whar-
ton's dorm hike proposal "caught
everyone ofl‘ guard."

“Wharton slapped down a pro—
posal ar the May trustce meeting
that no one had heard of before."
said Snook. “His methods were
secretive and unethical. lie was
clearly trving to avoid student
pressure."

SllNYA Acting Director of
Residences i’aul Doyle said he was
“shocked” when he heard about

the rate hike. He said he had been
given no prior knowledge of the
hike. and was first made aware of it
after the May trustee meeting.

According to Vice Chancellor
Spindlcr. however. plans for the
hike have been publicly discussed
“since January."

Residence Director Doyle said he
would have preferred that an an-
nonnccment about the initial hike
had been made prior to May so that
a proper list of room prices could
have been published. A letter was
sent out this summer informing on—
campus students of the hike and of-
fering open release from housing
contracts. Only 120 otrt of 6400
took advantage of the release.
Doyle said.

Vice Chancellor Spindlcr said
that. in retrospect. an announce-
ment prior to May might have been
possible. He added. however. that
the situation \vtrh ~tatc subsidies
was “unpredictable” at the tune.
