The break-ins and sexual assaults
in the Pine Hills Area have eon-
tinued to occur throughout most of
the summer. In response to the at—
tacks. a local group in Albany'has
been formed to force landlords to
protect tenants' homes from break-
ins.

Lieutenant Detective John
Domino of the Albany Police
Department said that in the time
period of May 2 to August 6. there
'iave been l8 complaints of sexual
assaults or attempted sexual
assaults in the Pine Hills Area and
Madison Avenue. Damino also said
that there have been such com-
plaints outside the Pine Hills Area
as well.

The modus opera/rdr‘ of the IS
Complaints have been similar. with
"probably ten of them“ committed
by the man called the Pine Hills
Molester. Daniino said.

On August 27 the Mayor said,
“There have been 53 attacks in two
years. I'm not sure if that's enough
to warrant the ordinance."

Cornitig also said that, “What
you have here is a case where one
man has committed two-thirds of
the attacks. What I want is the
mart."

Gelb asserts that this statement is
“simply untrue. Only 20 of all the

attacks have the same mat/us
operandi. It's going to take a lot
more than catching that 'one man'
to make the city safe for women."

At the August 27 meeting the
Mayor also said that tenants whose
landlords refuse to install proper
locks should contact Corning
directly.

In a phone interview, Mayor Cor-
tiing said he has problems with the

ordinance because it "would force
landlords to spctid hundreds of
dollars."

  

Albany Student Press

Crer asserted that the cost would
be minimal. "For I3 dollars a
landlord could biiy a really good
lock." she said.

“If the cost is less than twenty
dollars. they (tenants) ought to do it
themselves." the Mayor stated.

Corning also said that some
landlords have raised questions
about the constitutionality of such
an ordinance.

“You can‘t legislate for people to
lock their doors and windows," he
said.

To that ‘0ch responded,
"Women can't use locks that aren't
there."

Detective Lieutenant Datnino
emphasized the itced for Albany
women to becottie ttiore “security
conscious."

Last Thursday, September 4, the
Mayor prescrttcd the ordinance to
the Cortitiion Council. The or-
dinance was placed in the Council's

 

Housing and Urban Renewal Com-
mittee where. according to 6th ward
Alderman .losepb Bueclis, it could
“stay in committee indefinitely."

“Apparently, women's safety is
not a priority with Mayor Corn.
ing.“ 0er said. “When I went
door-to-door on Hudson Avenue to
tell people that the Mayor was com-
ing. about 75 pcrcetit of the
residents said that someone had
etttcred or attempted to enter their
homes."

SA Lawyer Jack Lester said that
if the security ordinance fails to
pass the Albany Common Council,
there are other possibilities that the
AAS can take.

Lester pointed ottt that there is a
state statute of the Real Property
Law called the “warranty of
habitability.“ The laws mandate
that landlords maintain a “safe
home" for their tenants.

“In Albany. we have apartments

Lester ilten outlined what he
thinks tenants in such tt situation
shoulddo. He said tenants should
first write a lcttcr to their landlord
requesting repairs of unsafe win.
dows and doors. If no rcpttirs tut-
made. they should contact the ('iiy
Code Enforcement Bureau to
record properly the unsafe situa-
tion.

“If repairs are still not mndc. the
tenant should withhold tcru tititil
such repairs are made. At that time
they should also come see the."
Lester said.

Lester stated that he thinks lilt'
security ordinance should be pttsscd
because the state statute is too tun»
biguous.

 

lti response to the large ntitnber
of attacks this past spring. the
Albany Alliance for Safety (AAS)
drafted a proposal for a city or-
dinattcc which would mandate a
fine of $200 or tip to fill tltiys iii jail
for landlords who fail to lntve
stronger doors. better locks. and
brighter lighting for their teiittiits'
homes.

The Albany Police Department
Crime Prevention Unit served an
advisory role in the drafting of this
proposal.

The AAS, wlticli includes groups
such as Albttny Wooten Against
Rape (AWAR). the Council of
Albany Neighborhood .I\s~.ociation-.

posal was being studied by the Cor—

the Knickerbocker News that he did

dinanees.

“A ‘voluntary‘ ordinance Would

SUNYA student Jackie (it-lb,
who is active in AAS, said that Roe
told AAS that he. was having dif-
ficttlty in writing the ordinance in
legalistic terms.

To solve that problem, on Atrgust
27 Gelb and other members of the
AAS arranged to show Mayor Cor-
ning several houses on Hudson
Avenue that AAS and the tenants
felt had por locks and easy eti-
trances.

The first house the Mayor was
shown had been broken into three
times before the landlord “pinned”
the windows. The second house had
a needle and eye lock on the back
door. A woman had been attacked
in this second house.

Students Win One Year On Senate h.

by Susan Milllgan

Although the May 9 assemblage
of the University Senate defeated
the proposed 4-year extension of
student representation oti the
Senate, students won a temporary
concession of one-year representa-
tion on the University's policy-
making body at art cntcrgency
meeting of the Senate less than a
week later.

th student organizations such as
the Student Union (SU) arid Stu-
dent Association (SA) are uneasy
about the temporary nature of their
victory and have begun work to
secure more permanent representa-
tion for students.

At the last meeting of the Senate.
:i motion was passed which iiicltidctl
the formation of ti committee to
review the question of student
representation on Senate. The corti—
mittcc has cotnposcd the following
proposal to be presented at the
University tiicctirtg tomorrow:

— that the Senate Study (‘om-
mittcc hold a series of meetings on
the Senate alternatives so that (Ill iii-

have an opportunity to respond;

-— that, following the hearings,
the Committee develop two or three
alternative proposals and submit
them to an advisory referetidum of
the voting faculty;

—- that the committee, on the
basis of the hearings and the ad-
visory referendum. prepare a single
proposal in the form of one or more
amendments to the By-Laws for
submission to a general faculty
meeting to be called early iii the spr-
irtg semester of l98l.

According to SA member Mark
Lafayeitc. SU and SA hbpe in con-
vince the Senate to agree to the ap—
pointment of two students on the
Study Committee, and also to allow
for the presentation of more tltan
“a sitiglc proposal" iii the spring.

The Committee has come up with
seven possible alternatives to date
concerning student representation
on Senate:

— to increase the current pro»
portion of students on Senate by
either increasing the number ol' sttt-
dciit seats or decreasing the number
of faculty seats;

but restrict agenda. Under this
alternative, the Senate structure
would remain basically unchanged.
but only members of the teaching
faculty would vote on matters deal-
ing with academic standards
(admissions, grading, honors, etc.)
and curricular and degree rc-
qtnrenients;

— to maintain current Senate,
but create a faculty forum. This
body could consist either of
teaching faculty on the Senate or it

separately elected faculty, and
would review academic matters
referred to them by the President or
initiated by the faculty;

—— to reduce the current propor-
tion of students on Senate by either
reducing the tiunibcr of student
seats or removing all but two
graduate student seats and convert
them to teaching faculty seats
(retaitiing the current nutnber of 22
undergraduate seats);

— to convert the Senate t» a
purely faculty governing body;

—— to abolish the Senate and its
councils and reconstruct the entire
campus governance structure.

According to SA President Sue
Gold, student input on the Study
Committee is~ imperative.

“Not only should students be on
Senate. but they should certainly be
involved in the process of develop-
ing an effective University gover-
nance structure," she said.

Student Union chair .Ilm Tierney
said that SU members share his
outrage that students have been
given only temporary representa-
tion.

“We think it's ridiculous in a
University community that
students, being intelligent human
beings. won't have any say in deci-
_,,sions which affect their academic
and social lives," said Tierney. “In
the name of any semblance of
democracy. students must be fairly
represented on Senate." '

Trustees Delay Certiﬁcations

by Patricia Brunlcy

The certification of two SUNY
Studctit Assertiny Officers. Presi-
dent .lirn Stcrtt arid Vice President
for Campus Affairs Janice Fine,
has been coitiplctcd after it delay by
the SUNY Botttd of Trustees. tic-
cording to Vice Chancellor for
Educational Services Dr. James
Stnoot.

The Student Assembly is the of-
ficial governance grotip rcprcseti~
ting student governments of all
SUNY campuses. This student body
serves as a consultant to the Board
of Trustees on matters of students"
interests. The president of the Stit—
dctit Assembly serves oti the Board
of Trtistccs and has regular voting
privileges.

“The reason for the delay iii the
certification of Fine and Stern was
the implementation of ti by»law
wlticli. as proposed, hatl not been
fttlly advanced to the Board ol'
'I‘rtistecs," said Smoot.

"An amendment to the by—lnw
had ttot at the time been approved

by the Student Assembly.
Therefore. Stern and Fine cottld not
be certified," Sinoot continued.

“The amended by»|uw which had
bccrt proposed iri 1977 states that
Student Assembly delegates could.
be appointed by their student
governments rather than be elected
by their student botly," said Stu-
tlcnt Assembly Executive Vice
President Jason Wcrtltcirn.

\Vcttbcitn was elected when he
run on it combined Sttidcni Associa-
tioti of the State University of New
York. ltic. (SASU). and SUNY Siti-
tictit Assembly ballot.

"Both little and Stern were up-
poititcd to the Student Assembly.
All three officers were elected to
SASU and hold the some positions
as they do in the Student
Assembly." said Wcrthcim.

“The difference between the
organitzttion is that SASU is it
private group for student udvocttcy
and the Student Assembly is i
SUNY advisory group," Wcrthciin
added.

ROTC May Be Implemented at SUN YA

by Susan Mllligan

SUNYA may be the site of a new
ROTC program, possibly as early as
next fall, the ASP learned ycstcr-
day. The source, who asked to re-
mttin tinidetitificd. said that
negotiations were underway conccr»
ning an “extension center agree-
ment.” which would result iii
ROTC courses being taught on the
SUNYA campus.

Currently. the Utiiversity offers
"cross-enrollment," a program itt
which students may earn credit for
military science courses taketi at
other schools. According to the
source, a straw poll was taken early
this year which revealed
“significant interest" in the forma-
tioti of an ROTC program at
SUNYA. He added that he didn't
know who was polled, btit that 385
students had expressed interest ilS of
February. Negotiations, he said,
have been going on siticc April.

Art extension center agreement
would provide the U.S. Artny assets
to be on campus, he said,

According to SA Controller lra
Somaclt. the proposal tnitst go
through several channels before it is
tipprovcti.

“The proposalmttstfirst go to the
curricular committee of the
Undctgrttdtnttc Academic Coitticil
(UAt‘). and course suggestions will
be made," suitl Sottirich. “It will
then go to the University Scuttle.
who will make It recommendation

 

to the president. President O'l.cttry

ultimately decides oti the pro-
posal."
However, Somtich noted that

since the president has the power to
change academic policy, he cottld
conceivably allow the extension
cctiter agreement without the cort-
stiltation of University Senate.

Somacli said he had no
knowledge of ti straw poll.

SUNYA President Vincent
O'Lettry said he is aware of the pro—
posal, btit “nothing has been decid-
ed yet.

"The proposal must go through
the Educational Policy Committee
of the Senate.” he said.

Since students are currently able
to receive credit for ROTC courses
taken on other campuses. the actual
courses have already been approved
by the Uttiversity Senate.

“it's a question of where the
courses will be taught." O'l.eary
said. "We want to tlo what’s most
convenient to students."

()’I.eary added that he knew
nothing about a straw poll beitig
taken, and that he has not formed
art opinion concerning ROTC on
campus.

"l have to look at the isstrc as it
whole,“ ltc said.

According to Student Associat-
tion of the State University (SASU)
Organizing Director Bruce Cronin.
the proposed RO'I‘C program will
be itict with titttclt opposition from

SASU and Stttdcitt Union.

"SASU voted against ROTC on
State University campuses last
December." be said, “An attempt
was made to insttttc the program at
Gencsco, and the students fotrglit it
and won. The same sort of action

 

 

 

 

 

can be expected if the proposal is to
be initiated at SUNYA."

‘ According to Cronin, an ROTC
program has already been instatcd
at l’rcdonitt. and the progratn is

“Tltc Board of Trustees resolved

Carey Vetoes
Alumni Bill

by Andrew ('iirrnll

(itr\Cl'Ilt)f lliiglt (‘tttcy has again
ungctcd supporters of tire SUNY
system, this time with rt veto of a
bill that would insure alumni
representation on the SUNY Board
of Trustees.

The Governor rejected a bill that
passed unanimously in the
Assertiny last March calling for at
least three members ol' the
lfi—mctnber board to be SUNY
alumni. Carey claimed tltc bill
wottld have restricted his ability to
appoint the most highly qualified
individuals to the Board.

“Governor ('ttrcy's veto of the
alumni bill will pttsli the State
Urtivcrsity backwards," said Stu—
dent Association ot‘ the State
University (SASU) President Jitn
Stern.

The Governor's veto came as a
shock to SASU members and other
supporters of the bill who had seen
Carey set a precedent earlier this
year when lie appointed tltrcc uluui—
iii to the Board. This action brought
Altttitiii representation to the Board
for the first titnc since SUNY's
creation iti I‘)4li.

SASU points to the traditions of
other institutions. both pttblic and
private, when railing against the
Governor's veto. SASU cites
CUNY's Board of Trustees govern-
ing statutes as providing for alumni
representation. The SUNY Board

.of Trustees. however. ltas seen the
appointment of 55 trustees, 43 of
whom graduated from private col-
leges. and 18 from Ivy League
scltools.

"There must be board members
who understand the needs of public
higher education." said Stern. “In
these times of budget cuts attd
restrictions. we need insight itito the
politics anti goals of otir cam-
puses." ‘

SASU finds fault iti Carey's con-
tention of “constricted hiring
abilities," Stern said. “Of the
l.()00,000 graduates of SUNY. he
tiittst be able to find three highly
qualified individuals."

Stern says SASU and other lob-
byitig organizations will continue to
trim for the bill‘s passage itt
January, when the bill will be rein-
troduced ' eforc the legislature.
