The SA Supreme Court declared
the Spring l980 off-campus Univer-
sity Senate electioh invalid. accor-
ding! to Chief Justice Brad
Rothbaum. The four Justices ruled
on May ii that the SA Election
Commission acted in violation of
the SA Constitution which states,
according to Rothbaum's report.
that “no tax~card be required of

Morgenstern contended that
because the Election Commission
mandated that students present
their tax-cards before voting. many
potential voters were turned away.
However. although SA conducts
the student elections. the University
Senate is not an SA body. and
therefore. tax-cards are not re-
quired for Senate elections.
' The Court, in agreement with the

students who wish to vote for can- 0 plaintiff Morgenstcrn. declared the

The case was brought to the
Supreme Court by SUNYA student

defeated in his bid for an off-
campus seat on the Senate. Accor-

Until the replacement election is
held, Rothbaum said that Sue Gold
has a “free hand" in appointing
seven temporary off-campus stu-
dent Scnatc representatives. He said
that Gold is in the position to ap-
point those who could “best serve
the students‘ interests" until a new
election is held.

The Court was concerned.
Rothbattm said; that student seats
in the Senate not be vacant until the
new election. The Senate, which has
a membership of approximately

100, consists of VS faculty. i/3 ad-
ministration. and 1/3 students.
However, ll of the student seats are
reserved for graduate students. of
which only 2 or 3 actually are ﬁlled.
according to Gold. This leaves only
22 seats for undergraduates. of
which seven are off-campus
representatives.

if when the Senate meets for the
first time on September 15 without
those seven students. “We'd be
under-represented." Gold said.
This would mean “an inequity to
students."

Gold has appointed those
students who won last Spring's elec-
tion as temporary off-campus
Senate representatives.

Only those students who ran for
office in the original election can

~ Although the police were notified
of the incident in October. they did

Thomas, who graduated from

' reportedly collected mostly books

on economics and political science.

The stolen books were taken out
through the front entrance of the
library. Thomas expressed surprise
that the detectors were not set off
by the thefts.

The library uses the Knogo
system ofthcft detection. Books are
lined up with special metal strips
set off an alarm if books are taken
out of the library front entrance un-
checked. However. not all of the
library books contain these metal
strips.

“The system is not foolproof.” ~

tor Rick Tastor. “It is a deterrent
system." However. in the future
librarians will be watching the front
entrance. especially at peak hours.
should'the alarm be set off. Also.

'more books will be lined with the

metal stripping.
