SUN YA Bus Service Reduced

continued front page one
University‘is under no obligation to
provide service down to the
Trailways station, and the time and
gas wasted as well as wear and tear
on the buses were factors in the
decision to end the Trailways ser-
vice.

“Thc trip tip and down the State
Street hill was very bad for the
brakes and transmission.‘ '«l
Stevens. "it was just too C05ll}."

Goid said she is working on even-
tually securing service to the
Trailways station on Fridays and
holidays.

SlCVCnS said he "would like to be .

able to do it, bttt there just aren't
enough drivers."

    

 

When you ask good
friends iol‘ a tinor. you know
what they're going to say. So

they're going to he there.
When you're linishetl, these
lit‘tliiit‘ are going to deserve

let it he l.o\yenhr.‘ttl.

Stevens mentioned also that the
Division of Budget (DOB) man-
dated a ten percent decrease in total
mileage of University vehicles. and
the shortened Wellington route
helped to fulfill that requirement.

Since the decision to change the
bus routes was made over the sum-
mer. many students returning to
sch 'ol via Trailways or Greyhound
l mes were unaware of the elimina-
tion of bus service from those sta-
tions. However, Stevens countered
lit he sent 5000 liycrs to both sta-
lions .o notify students of the
change.

According to Stevens, last year's
policy of stopping at requested cor-
ners at‘ter 6p.m. in the interest of



women’s safety was creating more
problems than it solved.

“When a bus driver had to make
an extra stop, the schedule was
thrown off. Consequently, other
women were waiting alone for buses
that came late; 1 have a whole pile
of complaints from women saying
the buses didn't arrive at the
scheduled times," he said.

Gold said that after discussion.
Stevens agreed to add a stop at
Western Ave. and Ontario. Accor-
ding to Gold, with this added stop.
the Pine Hills area is pretty well
covered.

“it was a compromise, but i
don't think we had a choice," she
said.

Gold mentioned also that she an-

ticipates ‘ Stevens wiil eventually
phase out all Wellington service.
Stevens said he “doesn’t know” if
this will occur, but that it was con-
tingent on the number of students
requiring transportaion from the
Wellington Hotel.

Several bus drivers, all of whom
wished to remain anonymous, ex-
pressed dissatisfaction witii the
changed schedule. ‘

“The students are not going to
like having to walk up State Street
with their suitcases," said one

‘ driver. “And it’s going to create a

bad relationship between the drivers
and the students. They’ll get angry
with us, then we’ll get angry with
them.” ‘
Another driver said that “(the

- driversididn't have anything to say

about it. We tried to tell (Stevens) it
wouldn’t work . . . we’re just going
to give it our best effort.

Anderson

continued from page one
may still remember Anderson's at-
tempt in 1960 to name Christianity
the national religion. A campaign
aid of the Congressman continued
this, but noted in defense, that

.“Anderson was new to Congress,
‘and very conservative. He has
already apologized for that ac-

tion." v

Anderson himself said he ﬁnds it
difﬁcult to believe “anyone in the
Carter campaign who had the
audacity to suggest" that his posi-
tion changed too often when “the
Carter administration has proposed
seven economic programs in 43
months and 3 budgets in eight mon-
ths.

While the Congressman’s cam-
paign theme is “the Anderson Uni-
ty Campaign," the latest polls,
claiming close and nearly equal
numbers of state victories for
Carter and Reagan and none for
Anderson, are hardly indicative of
such unity. Some have theorized
that Anderson‘s candidacy was a

deliberate attempt on the part of the

Republican party or the Tri-Lateral
Commission to keep Carter from
being re-eleeted. Anderson seemed
slightly angry at the suggestion that
he is serving simply as a "spoiler."

“Consider the source," he said.
“Jimmy Carter could be called a
spoiler. That person (making the
accusation) is making a political
assessment for obvious political ad»
vantage of a particular candidate.
The early polls could be mean-
ingless . . . we have a chance to br-
ing out millions who might other-
wise not vote."

An Anderson campaign aid in—
sists that the Congressman's sup-
port is nearly equally divided bet-
ween Democrats, Republicans, and
Independents, and that his sup-
porters are also diverse in age.

if Anderson does indeed have the
support not‘ any or all political af-
filiations, religious affiliations, or
any other groups one might put
voters into, one can‘t help wonder—
ing if his opportunities are equal to
those of the Democratic and
Republican nominees. individual
states have separate laws and re-
quirements to get an independent
nominee even listed on the ballot,
and the regulations for the most
part do not favor the Independent
candidate — especially if that can-
didate attempted nomination by a
political party. Those who voted for

.Anderson in the Republican

primary in New York State cannot
sign a petition to list Anderson on
the ballot as an independent, accor-
ding to an Anderson campaign
coordinator. Fund-raising has
always been a problem for Indepen-
dent candidates. Anderson sup-
porters have raised about 6 million
of the 15 million Anderson expects
he will need to conduct an adequate
campaign through November.

Anderson just recently won a
Federal Election Commission ruling
that would qualify him for retroac-
tive federal funds after the election.
Anderson is now negotiating for
loans. borrowed against the federal
aid, but declined to name which
banks he was considering. Ander-
son said he was seeking "as much as
he can get," adding that “a fair
amount would be 29.4 million —
just like Carter and Reagan."

Despite a veritable deck of cards
stacked against the independent
candidate. his campaign coor-
dinators seem optimistic.

“We have already had a couple
of good breaks,“ said one. “We
have received a great amount of
contributions, and the Federal Elec-
tion Commission has ruled in oui'
favor. With his iii-partisan support,
Anderson will sweep the election.”
