Military Shame

The US. Defense Department is
spending $200,000 to design what is
described as “the most efﬁcent war
room money can buy."

The British publication New
Scientist reports that a Pentagon
contract has been awarded to a
British consulting firm for the
design of a communications center
that would be fully capable ofdirec-
ting World War Three.

The British firm working on this
project is an enterprise called Corn-
inunications Studies and Planning.

The firm is reportedly conducting
studies in which four people -
simulating the President of the
United States and three top Pen-
tagon generals - talk over war

gorse a

strategy over a closed-circuit T.V.
network.

s New Scientist magazine says that
a special feature in the projected
war room will enable each of the
generals to communicate with the

president anonymously. The reason»

for tltis “anonymous feature” is
that. ditring a time of extreme
crisis. a general might be reluctant
to disagree with his colleagues or
with the president face-to-face.
However. by being able to use
special channels to disagree
anoriynto'u-sly. tlte gortcral would be
able to speak his mind without fear

Like, ya know

A language researcher at the
University of Illinois is out with a
new argument against the legaliza-
tion of marijuana.

Bruce Hayman. a doctoral can-
didate in English. claims that the
widespread use of pot is having a
ruinous effect on the English
language.

Hayman says that a drug-related.
subculture speech 'pattern has

developed among teenagers and col-
lege students in recent years -- a
language that repeatedly uses such
phrases as “you know" and "like."

Hayman gives the following ex-
ample: “So. you know, like Keith
orders this sapdwich, and it's like
huge. And so, you know. we’re sit-
ting there. and he's holding it like
with both hands and eating it. So i
go. ‘That’s no sandwich; that's a
football.‘ And he goes. you know.
with‘his mouth full: 'Back off. will
ya? l‘m getting in shape for dinner.‘ .
it was really funny."

Hayman claims that marijuana

Hayman says that. people who
believe language is one of our major
accomplishments should be out
crusading against the legalization of
pot.

Dopey Law

Some legislators apparently don't
know exactly what they're voting
on.

The Pennsylvania Senate
Judiciary Committee was just abt ut
~to vote on a bill outlawing drug
paraphernalia when \ Senator
Michael Scliaefcr pointed out that
no one knew what they were talking
about. The Senator was referring to
the words “hang” and “chillum”.

Scltaefcr asked his fellow
legislators if any of tlteni could tell
him what a bong or a chillum was
and reporter.in got a dopey
response.

Said Sclitiei'cr, “I don‘t think we
should outlaw something if we
don't know what it is."

The legislators subsequently
\otcd to outlaw ilic sale ol’ bongs
and chillunts after finding out what

“diet pipe and it cliiilutn is a cone»
\llllpt‘tl smoking device.

Reagan in ‘Space’

\ group oi nohcl laureate. has
t\|l[lCll ti l'otliiztl letter to Ronald
Reagan, tlsklltg the GOP pie-widen—
littl ctiittlidatcz-v “Do you really
believe iti astrology?"

The five Nobel Prize-winners. in
the letter drafted by the Federation
ol‘ American Scientists, say they are
“gravely disturbed" at recent
newspaper reports to the effect that
Reagan consults his horoscope
cltart before making arty major
decisions.

The letter alleges that there is no
scientific basis for astrological
beliefs. and adds - in its words -
“we would welcome any informa-
tion you could send us that would
dispel the notion that your
presidential decision-making would
be biased by these or other supersti-
tions."

   

The Reagan-Bush campaign. in
response, has this to say: “Mr.
Reagan has a casual interest in
astrology, nothing heavy. l-le simp-
ly. like most people. checks the
astrology in the paper."
