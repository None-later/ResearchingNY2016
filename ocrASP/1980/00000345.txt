Nice to be back.

Golden tans and summer smiles swim across the campus. Frolic and f-risbees. And
everyone looks so damn healthy. Welcome back. Or hello — if you’re just arriving.
' And now — the abused question: So how was your summer? It seems to be the

most popular topic on campus these last few days. Saw someone on the podium
yesterday with a T-shirt that read, “Don‘t ask, it was fine.” That seemed to sum it

tip well enough. I

Yes, welcome back indeed.

it’s the time of year we seem to cherish most —— and cry to preserve — before the
Albany chill and eternal booking attenuatto rob uaof the seasonal magic.

Anyone notice the brand new signs around the campus —— in the student center,
even in the library. Real neat.

' And the downtown dorm even has a new carpet. Love to run my naked toes over it
(why not?). K

Funny how such little changes can catch the eye of a returning student.

We‘re pretty happy up here too. A few brand new typewriters, new writers (who
can’t type), clean ﬂoors, fresh machines . . . acarpeti . . . what more can a jour-
nalist want out of life. -

Bizarre how everyone rags about this place all year yet September brings us all
back in a flurry. And you new students may likely adapt as such. it’s a ‘vicious cir-

, cie’. Only not so vicious.

Are we wrong or do students seem more politically active and aware this fall. We
can spot the energy — it showed its face when Anderson rode into town yesterday.

, What an impressive crowd.

Perhaps this is due to the approaching presidential election. Or perhaps this past
summer’s draft registration freaked us out a tit. Or maybe a newly-elected student
government, a hyperactive assortment ofgroups such as SASU, Student Union, and
NYPIRG. Maybe because students may be losing avoice on the University Senate —
positions we held for twelve full years. Could be the sudden build-up of our defense
budget — nuclear weapons — the world situation. Perhaps a combination of all or

Some of these.

Guess we'll have to look into it deeper. You can too.
As students at this university, we are changing the very face of it. Whether it be

 our personal metamorphosis as we stride through a few years, or through our power

 to affect change here — we can be certain of one thing and one thing only —- that
when we. leave, both ourselves and the university will be considerably changed —-

" each as a result of the interaction.

A dynamic process . . . if you take part. Follow your tune here at SUNYA and see
where it leads you. Grab the campus by its foundation and squeeze the energy onto
you. it’s here for the taking. it’s here for you.

Create. Do. Join. Experiment. Scream :1 little. Get loaded. Ace a class. Flunk one
too. Start writing that book. Fall in love. Get laid. Be cclibate.

interact with the‘Environment and don‘t be concerned with what others (even your

roomie) may think.

You have an obligation to your heart. Be you.

And welcome home.

Students Must Be On Senate

Once again the question of student representation on the University Senate is here
—— and we strongly urge President O’Leary and all faculty members to support it.
For the first time in twelve years, students had been voted off the Senate last spr—

ing by a count of ll4-112.

Students won a temporary victory when they were granted a one—year representa-

tion, but the structure is shaky.

 

Anger of an Off-Campus Woman

To the Editor:

l keep a brick by my bed, a whistle under
my pillow. I lock my bedroom door, shut the
window and can’t breathe. And still, l don't
feel really safe. The Pine iiiils Molcslcr(s) is
(are) still about.

it makes the angry ttot to be able to feel
comfortable walking in the streets or loung—
ing in my home. it makes the angry that this
attacker would tie a woman to her bed and
proceed to molest her (August '80 on South
Allen St.) And tny anger is only magnified
when i see Mayor Comings attitude on the
entire situation.

Fifty-three attacks is not reason enough to
pass a city ordinance mandating that
landlords have good secure locks on their
tenants' buildings. or so the Mayor says.

What kind of shit is that? 53 attacks -— and
those are the reporter] ones. A case that has
been bewildering the Albany Police Dept. for
l-2 years and that's not “reason enough"?

Women go to sleep with bowie knives by
their beds, have whistles clutched in their
hands and are frightened to be in their homes
alone and that's not reason enough? You see,
just because you pay rent doesn't mean your
apartment has to be Well secured.

Contrary to general belief, not all the

women who were attacked left their doors
open. Many entrances by the attacker came
about because of insecure locks on windo wa'
urtd doors.

So be sure you lock up. However, if you
aren’t satisfied with the locks on your doors
and/or windows, call Mayor Corning
(462-8600) and pressure him to call your
landlord to rectify the situation.

Don‘t just get frustrated. Get mad. Our
collective anger will help force the city to take
a role in making our home safe.

One has to wonder what students did to deserve this tally. It couldn't be apathy}
student senators show up at three times as many meetings as their‘faculty counter-
parts. It couldn’t be lack of accomplishments; student senators have generally been
effective in gauging student opinion and translating it into Coherent voices on the
floor.

it could be that some faculty members are tired'of having to deal with such com- -
petence. The University Senate is SUNYA's system of governance; it creates policy
which effects all the factions of the university. There is no question faculty members
deserve to be on the Senate. They work here. Students go to classes and live here,
and they too should have a voice in decisions which affect them. It’s pure and simple
logic.

That argument alone is so powerful that all excuses by faculty opponents fade in
comparison. One gets the feeling that students are being punished for being well-
organized and competent. Or perhaps for shortcomings of the faculty.

We urge President O'Leary, who has repeatedly pledged support for student par—
ticipation, to join our struggle when meeting with the faculty on Wednesday. To the
112 members who voted for students, here is a heartfelt wOrd of thanks. Let’s hope
that many of these other faculty members care enough about this university to show
up Wednesday and work towards reversing this regrettable decision.

ROTC- Not With the Educated

"By I984, given the involvement of such (1 large proportion of our young people with
military service, the military will have become a major instrument for youth socialization -——
assuming a large portion of the role once dominated by the family, the church, the school, and
(he "mm" W" ‘Wung' - Thomas Can. Director of Defense Education, Office of tile Secretary of Defense

That's only four years from now. is SUNYA on the way?

Perhaps it may be, if certain recruiters get their way, in the hopes of establishing
an ROTC office right here on campus. A University Senate Committee will soon ad-
dress the issue, but President O'Leary would have to give approval.

Why the interest in ROTC? Well, it is claimed (by a recruiter who asked not to be
identified for some peculiar reason) that a SUNYA poll showed well over 300
students favoring and requesting the office. Neither the ASP, SA, SASU, nor the
Student Union heard of such a survey, and we’d all be most interested in when and
how it was carried out.

Why such an alarm?

Well,.a major goal of ROTC has been to increase student receptiveness and indoc-
trinization into the military.

Their techniques are astounding. «

in l978 for instances, a $70 million recruitment advertising campaign was spent
on school newspapers; sport schedules, magazines, posters, etc.. exposing students
to an average of 9 to 10 military ads per month.

We must ask ourselves, is it appropriate for the military to use SUNYA as a
primary recruiting ground? is it also justified for the Army to keep files on every
potential ROTC enlistee by obtaining names from schools, national testing
organizations, honor societies, and youth groups, as they do now?

And if plans are in the making for an ROTC, why weren't parents and professors
consulted about how much military influence should be allowed on campus?

SASU voted last December against the cstablisltmcnt of ROTC offices on SUNY
campuses. Yet while sortie campuses have fought to keep them off (and won). others
now have established ccrtters.

Perhaps activist Glenda Poole, a mother of two sons, said it best:

"If we are to survive as a civilization we must not learn war any more. "

We ask President O'icary and the Senate to deeply consider this sensitive and im-
perative issue.
