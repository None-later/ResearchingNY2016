what makes Tech Hifi
the best place to buy stereo?

’/1 m

Appliance stores
and department. stores
are not the best places
to buy quality stereo.
You'll do much better at
a stereo store.

'l‘he problem is.
which stereo store" You're about
to read why over 2 million music
lovers have decided to bin from

Tech l'lil'i.

It’s OK
to pick our brains.
(We know our stereo).

’l‘lie salespeople at Tech llil‘i
knew what they're talking about.
They work at Tech because they
love stereo. not because they
love selling.

Our people keep up with all
the latest equipment. and can tell
you the differences among the
leading brands.

You get to play

at Tech Hifi, not Just look.
Some stereo stores have

signs all over that tell you

"Don't Touch The Merchandise".
At. ’l‘ech llil'i our signs say

"(.‘omc i’lay.” We encourage you

to spin knobs. push buttons. toss

switches. and try out any of the

components in our soiindroom.

It you take enough lime to play
111 a Tech llil'i soilnilroom. you'll
get a good idea of which
equipment sounds best in your
price rainyc.
