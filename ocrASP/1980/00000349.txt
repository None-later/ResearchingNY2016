Lineup  Bolsters Talent

by Marc Httspel

A mostly‘revainped Albany varsi-
ty baseball team opens its fall
season September 13 against Utica.
After going on a “recruiting ram~
page" ditrittg the offseason. Albany
head coach Rick Skeet feels tltat his

1980 team has the taletit arid depth
to win.

Winning did not come easily last
season as tlte Danes finished with a
12-19 record. Fifteen of those
games, however, were decided by
one or two runs. Nonetheless, Skeel

was not happy with the team's
results and sought to rebuild his
squad for 1980.

“I‘m never satisfied with a losing
season. [‘m not too sure that we

were a whole ’ot l' 'ter t' 'm how we‘

did," said

Subsequeiitl'r, after heavily
recrttiting prospects. this year's ball
cltib has strong player seemingly
every position. Said Skew “We
lutve quality people where we need
them."

One weak area of last year‘s
squad was pitching. Perhaps it was

did a pitcher stay in for more than
five innings. Yet this season Skeel is
counting on three main starters who
he feels can do the job — Mike
Esposito, a mainstay from last
year's staff pitched very well as a
starter arid in relief. Campbell is a
strong throwing lefthander out of
Syracuse and Vaughn is a righty

with an excellent fastball.

"l have confidence in Jimmy. All
he’s got to do is the job expected of
him," remarked Skeet.

The Danes will feature an ex-
cellent infield this season with
Bruce Rowlands, formerly the
team‘s second baseman moving
over to third. Bob Tortorello, a
recruit from Rockland Coinrttunity

Skeel is really high on his double
play combo of Tortorello and
Rivera. Tortorello. the best addi-
tion to the diamond is, in Skeel's
eyes. the best shortstop around.
“He's got major league moves."
Skeel said.

Behind the plate, Skeet has three
big catchers all capable of ﬁlling
that position. The leading candidate
is all conference player Rich Car-
dillo, but he is hurting and Skeel
may look to newcomer Jerry Rosen
and Bob Brunner. both of whom
can change the complexion of the ~
game with the crack of the bat, ac-
cording to Skeel.
