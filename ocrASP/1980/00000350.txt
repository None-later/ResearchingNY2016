White. Leads Cowboys Over Washington, 1 7.31

(AP) Danny White, quarterbacking
Dallas with the aplomb of a Roger
Staubach. directed toucthWn
drives capped by runs of 6 drives by
Tony Dorsett and 4 yards by Ron
Springs Monday night as the
Cowboys beat the Washington Red-
skins 17-3.

Although it was the defense that
throttled the Redskins and handed

' them their first defeat in nine Mon-

day night hotne games it was the im-
perturbable White who shouldered
the pressure. stepping as he did into
the shoes of a mere legend.

The six-year pro. who spent one
year as a starter with Memphis in
the World football League and the
next four as Statibach's rarely used
understudy. put Dallas on the
scoreboard the second time the

Cowboys got the ball.

He drove them 80 yards in 12
plays, chewing up 6:39 of the clock
in the process. He passed four
times. completing three for 38 yards
before Dorsett stutter-stepped in
the ﬁnal 6 with 2:15 to go in the
first period.

it was the only score the two-and-
a-half point underdog Cowboys
needed to win their I61Il consecutive

National Football League season
opener.

But White. who completed a con-
servative 10 of 18 passes for 107
yards and was intercepted twice,
wasn’t finished. in the second
quarter, he guided the Cowboys 55
yards itt seven plays before Rafael
Septien kicked a 19-yard field goal.
The big play was a 37-yard bomb to
