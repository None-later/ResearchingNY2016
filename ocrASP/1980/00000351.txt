Harriers Face: Tough Campaign.

by Jeff Schadoff

The Albany men's varsity cross
country team opens up their 1980
campaign — their 19th season
overall — with a rather exorbitant
task ahead of them. “We have a
staggering schedule ahead of us."
comments Albany coach Bob
Munsey.

The Harriers ended the I979 year
with a rather disappointing 8-6
record with the junior varsity team
finishing with an impressive iZ-i-l.
This year the J.V. team was scratch-
ed front the budget.

All the Dane distancemen arrived
August 30th to_ begin their intense
workouts of up to IS miles per day.
Practices are held twice a day and
Munsey feels titat "they have look-
ed good. We're just hoping..."

The team is literally devastated
by losing their top five of the six
returning veterans. .luttior Scott
.larnes will undoubtedly Itave to
pick up a major portion of tlte slack
left behind by the rttissing.

James. voted l979's “Most
Hungry Harrier" by the tcartt artd
qualified for tlte Nationals last year
placing 64th ottt of 240 cont-
pctitor's, ﬁgures to sit on top as the
Danc’s number orte runner. “Right
now we‘re Itttrtittg had." said
Jatttes. “there‘s a lor of potential.
htrt it'll definitely be towards lite
end of tlte season when we‘ll puii‘
through. The guys are young and
we’re in dire need of sotttc ex-

periertce. but don’t worry — we'll

pull some surprises."

Battling it out for the second spot
on the team will be Todd Silva and
Tim Bradley. “Tint is tottgitcr than
Itell. He looks absolutely great.

 

He’s deﬁnitely got the ability as well
as Todd — who has already been
tested and shown he can carry the
load." commented Munsey.
Bradley said. “I didn’t run last year
whichmakes it tough. There's some
pretty big shoes to till. i hope to do
well-maybe even win a few meets.
This is it new experience for me but
I feel l’m adapting rather well."
Silva remarked on a pro-season
analysis saying. "We’re a very
young team. There are lots of
young guys that are looking good.
Realistically, we’re gonna get beat
this year but it will do us a lot of
good. Tim Bradley looks real good.
Scott James and l are really going
to have to carry the team. We might

pull off sonte surprises. Everybody
is really giving 100 percent and
hanging tough. We'll be runntng
IOO miles easin this week. Right
now l’m pretty impressed but
basically we're lit a rebuilding
year." ‘

Munsey is really depending on
the younger gttys to pull through.

They will be the ones to figure very, ‘,

important in the end results.
Newcomers include freshmen Jim
Robertson and Ting Kwok along
with Arlington High School's
“Blue Chip" indoor runner .I.
Hotaling (credited with a i:56.0
Italf mile).

Buren and Ken Carlstrom are being
counted on by Munsey to “fill sontc
of the gap left by the five 'missing
runners'." l'm looking forward to
my best year. We don't Itave tttuch
depth so i’ll be doing more for the
team this year than in the past. It's
going to be tough for us." said
Carlstront.

Coming up from junior varsity
are Dave Goldberg and Chris Lattt
who “both had super seasons last
year," said Munsey. Goldberg add—
ed. “There are a lot of kids who
aren’t used to the long distances.

' It‘s going to take a while to show

results — if at all. Since we started
practicing so late we'll come on
strong at the end. We'll peak just at
the right time."

Two transfer students breaking
into the lineup are juniors Tirtt
Kane from Mohawk Valley Cont-
rnurtity College and fill] Stanton
from Farmingdale, who won the
Junior College Championships at
the Albany invitational one year
ago. "The workouts are twice as
hard as. Fartttingdale's. Coach
Munsey really knows what he's titt-
ing. Considering what i've seen of

the team so far, we should be com-

petitive. We work as a team.” said

Stanton. Kane added, l‘l'm work-

irtg extra hard trying to work

together towards a team effort. We ~
do a lot ntore mileage here titan at

MVCC. We'llbe tired early but

towards the end we'll pull

through."

Rounding out the list ofreturnees
are seniors Bob Sanchez and Dave
Fabian along with Nick Sullivan
who is coming off leg injuries.

The Harriers face the always
tough Coast Guard Academy this
Saturday which proves to be a
"tough battle" says Munsey. Last
year's contest was won by Albany

.32-24.,_In the series with Coast

(iuard. Albany stands at 845.
Looking ahead, the Danes face
Syracuse. Army, and East
Stroudsburg which proves to be
more than ertouglt corttpetitiort.
Potential co-eaptain Scott James
feels that “the competition is a little
too good. We Itave the toughest
schedule of all the Albany sports
this year excluding maybe socCer.
The big meets are on ottr own home
course which will ltelp tts an awful
lot towards our goaI—-ttational

qualifying." V
Munsey feels that "if we beat
Coast Guard it'll be close. They

could really murder us. Right now,

we don't have the capability to
murder them."

Looking into his crystal ball,
Munsey half jokingly insinuates
“last year was hopeless but this year
we’ve got a huge hole to fill.
Ultimately, we are looking towards
the Nationals. Early meets are not
as important as the latter meets for
they are the meets that determine
our tickets to the nationals or not.
These guys are working hard but
I'm cautioust optimistic."

Welcome Back!

The buildings are the same. The lines certainly haven't changed. And
cafeteria life. well. that grumbles for itself. But Albany seems different
—— newer this year. l'm in a new position with theASP. and this column
is relatively new. And the Albany State sports scene is always changing.
Budgets get cut, and teams fold, but we try to do the best we can with
what we've got. Often. that’s not too bad, either.

For example: I

'The football team. Despite not having the great training facilities
and ntoney that other college programs do. the Danes always seem to be
recognized as contenders. and can often pull off that big win. But. as
'hings change. l980 is another year. We'll have to wait and see.

'The basketball team, coached by Dick Sauers. just returned from a
trip to Sweden. where they won eight of ten games. They raised the cash
to go themselves, and it gave the players a chance to get a slight head
start on the others. There's a score to settle with Potsdam. you know.

-The men‘s cross-country learn lost many top runners. But the
wisdom of itcad coach lioh Mttrtscy will keep them competitive in their
rigorous season.

That just names a few. There are loads of other teams to watch: soc-
cer, baseball. lacrosse, and. on the women's side, softball and soccer.
The talented people are Itere, attd it's up to us to stand behind them.

So catch a football game on a weekend. or a baseball game on a Fri-
day. Check ‘cm out. Teams perform better when they know they’re ap-
preeiated.

Take a walk through the athletic offices attd connect the faces to the
ttarttcs you hopefully will read twice-a-weck.

If you're more Iltc .tthletic type, intranturals are widespread on cam-
pus. ('Iteck ‘em out. 'l'hey'll keep you ill shape and maybe you'll rttlt in-
to sortie new people.

So relax and enjoyth place like you never did before and, if you're
new, check it out. Apltlll) is something that can really make things drag.
Don‘t let it happen to you.

 

To the Summer ’80 Crow:

has a great year.
