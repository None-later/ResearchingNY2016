to beat them as a team,“ Ford
noted. “We have to work together

it's been on my mind for the last

comparisons are made. they are
made with lthaca. Ford continued:
“Where are we in terms of compe-
tion with Ithaca? i would say pro-
bably we've got some more-than-
just-small problems that we’ve got
to get squared away." But Ford felt
titat the Danes are only small pro-
blems front being a good football
team.

lthaca is certainly a good football
team. They won their season opener
against Bloomsburg State. 58-3.
Bomber runningback Bob Ferrigno

MO yards versus Albatty last year).

you waiit to strive for — what you
wartt to become.” said Ford of the
natiottal champs.

But Ford is the optimist—the-

confident. positive thinker. “i
think we’re going to do a ltellitva
job. if you stop down in the locker-
roorn Saturday morning and ask me
how we're going to do against
Ithaca — we're going to beat them.
There's no question in my mind —
we’re going to beat them. That's the
attitude we'll go into this week
with, and we'll work like hell
toward that goal."

Improving Defense Needs ' Unity

by Marc Huspel

Team depth just may be the key
to a successful season for the 1980
edition of the Albany men's varsity
soccer team. Boasting a well-

balanced nucleus of talent. head

 

coaclt Bill Scliicffclin feels his team
will produce a firtc winning season.

in 1979. the booters finished with
a 6-5-1 record and a third place in
its division as numerous injuries
took their toll. "Last year.

 

substitutes were subbing for the
first string substitutes." said two
year veteran Vas Serdsev.

Yet Schieffelin felt that the 1979
season was a frustrating one, con~
sidcriitg that the Danes had ﬁnished

on top in 1978.

"The 1979 season was a little
disappointing. Lacking good team
depth. we lost games last season by
one goal to teams like Hartwick.
Oneonta and St. Francis." said
Schieffelin.

But this season. a ﬁne recruiting
campaign. along with many of last
year's returning players. has provid—
ed Schieffelin with the team
strength that he believes is necessary
in order to wiit.

Bench strength. however. is only
one area of the gameland realistical-
ly Schicffclin feels that his team still
needs to work and progress. “lt‘s
encouraging right now, but there's
a long way to go." noted Schicf—
felin.

Defensively. the team is blending
together despite the tentative loss of
defensive star Alex l’agano. lm-
proving greatly as the season nears,
the team only let up two goals in

three games in a recent
quadrangular cxhibition against
Colgate. Williaiitstown. and

Castlcton here at Albany.

“We're still trying to ﬁnd the
right combination oti defense,"
Sclticffelin remarked.

Schieffelin hopes that his two
regular fullbacks, Luis Arango at
sweepcrback arid Keith Falconer at
stoppcrback. will be able to pull the
defense tightly together.

The Dane‘s offense. with youth
and talent. seems potent enough to
constantly apply pressure and” score
goals.

With a vastly improving defense
and a steady offense, Schieffelin
describes his team as very well
balanced. “Our strength is that we
have no real strength. no total
domination in one single area."
Schieffelin said.

The Danes feature. however. one
of the ﬁnest goalies in the state.
Alberto Giordano. Not only an ex-
cellent goaltender with quickness
and good range. Giordano is also a
seasoned team leader. He believes
the team is playing more inspired
ball than last year. “There‘s been
improvement since the ﬁrst scrim-
mages. Everyone's working very
hard. There’s unity. cooperation
and a better attitude. Things are
looking better titan last year."
Giordano commented.

Yet. despite all the positive signs
thus far. a rough schedule lies
ahead for the Great Danes. Being
one of the hardest in the division.
the scltedule includes four meetings
with Division l teams.

Barring injuries this season.
Schieffelin feels his team is ready to
battle for the top of the division
once again. “if we cart keep our
team in shape. we'll be competitive
and an cxcitittg team to watch."
said Schieffelin.

Great Depth, Balance Key To Netmen SucCess

by Larry Kuhn

For the last few years Albany
State’s men’s tennis team has had a
few excellent top line players. btit
has not been able to win tltc crucial
matches at the bottom of thc ladder
with any kind of consistency. This
season. one ltighliglttcd by tltc loss
of mainstay Larry Linctt, could be
different.

“We have one tltirig this year that
we haven’t had for the last four
years —— depth." said Albany tennis
conch Bob Lewis. “We will win
points at five and six with more
consistency titan in the past. That
takes sortie pressure off the guys at
the top of the ladder. We don't
have any All-Airtcricans this year.
but we have excellent depth."

With Linctt lost to graduation it
would appear that a gaping ltolc is
left in the Albany lineup. Liitctt
won 45 matches while losing oiin 13

in his three year stay at Albany ,

which was topped off by it first
round victory in the N(‘/\A Nil-
tional Totirr nniciil last spring.
Nevertheless. chis feels that the
learn will bc able to compensate.
“Larry has been a fine player for
its for the last three years. Anytime
you lose your number one player
it's a big loss." said Lewis. lint he is
quick to add. “it‘s nothing we can't
handle. We have a young learn -
willing to work and eager to play.
l'm looking forward to working
with all of them."
I One of the reasons for his op—
ttmisrn is the return of Barry Levine
(18-6 last year) . who was also
selected to play in tltc Nationals. He
won his ﬁrst round match and
along with Linetg led Albany to a
ninth place tie in a ﬁeld of thirty

tlirec teams. Last year Levine and
Linert locked horns in a friendly but
very competitive battle for the
number one spot on the learn with
Levine winning tltc honor in the
fall. but Linctt cant buck strongly iii
the spring to claim tltc title for
himself.

This year Levinc is much illlpl'ti\"
ed and will step nicely into tiic
leadership role vacated by Linctt.
"liarry has improved his second
scrvc greatly from last year arid his
all around game has improved."
Lewis noted. ‘llc's it good inllticiicc
on the tcant as well - r loves to play
tennis. works very hard. and has a
very good attitude."

th according to Lewis. l.c\'iiic
will by no means have a lock on
number one this ycarr: “'l'hc loss of
Linctt won't effect llilll)’ too much.
ilc‘ll still lrc pressured from guys
like l’icd (inbci. He'll be facing
good crriiipctitioii front other
guys." (ialicr. who was ill-l lust
full. including winning the
SUNYA(' cliniiipionsliip in tire
nnnihci four slot. is slated to start
number two this year. Lewis feels
that (iabcr's return nl'tcr missing
the spring season "should help the
team a lot."

.Olit: frtcc missing from the courts
this fall will he Lawrence liiclicn
who sprained his ankle during prac-
tice on Thursday. Eiclicii was 8-8
last year and probably would have
made the top three. "Lawrence's
loss ittirts us a little bit. biit we can
recover," said Lewis. “We have
very good balance on this team. The
new kids coming in will help."

Tire team hasn't had time for a
lot of playoffs yet this season. but
so far it looks like three freshmen

    

will be in the three. four. and ﬁve
positions on the ladder. Leading the
way is Rob Klil'L‘ll who has been a
pleasant surprise so far. “Rob has
been playing really well." Lewis
noted, "l‘in very impressed with his
play m he should fill iii nicely."
Following Karen are Russell Kasow
and l)1t\iti lJlr'ccbi who should pro-
vide the squad with the depth that
has been cluding them for years.

The sixth singles spot is the only
one still pretty ntuclt up for grabs.
The leading contenders for the job
are transfer strident Rob l-‘ritr. and
veterans Dave Lerner and Andy
Diamond.

’I'hc doubles pairings have ten»
tntively been set with Levine and
(tuber teaming tip as the first pair
and Karen and Ulrcclit in the sc—
coiid spot. The lltitd doubles tcnni
has not been determined at this
time.

The team stints their season on
\\’cdncsday against ()iieonta :it 1:00
on the Indian Quad ('oiirts.

The schedule should be it tough
one this season facing such teams as
Vassar and Vermont and an ex-
cellent ficld iii the (ircat Dunc 'l‘cn-
nis (.‘Iassic. “Our goals this year are
to do well as host in the Great Dunc
Classic and to wiit SUNYAC's
which we won last year with fotir
freshmen." Lewis noted. "This
year we should face some very stiff
competition front lliiigliampton.”

The netters figure to be a lot
tougher and more balanced than
last year when they finished with
nine wins and nine losses —— their
worst record in eight years.
although they did win SUNYACs.
"We're defirtitely stronger than last

year — we ltavc itiore depth." said
