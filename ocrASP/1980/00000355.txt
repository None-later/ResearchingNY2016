Reported This Semester

 

Waterbury Scene of} Latest

by Sue Smith

SUNYA Campus Police'in-
vestigator Gary O’Connor» has
estimated that 400 SUNYA students
are victims of theft each semester.
Since Labor Day weekend, police
records show there have already
been ﬁve burglaries on campus.

A recent occurence took place,

last Monday in room 155 Water-
bury Hall, Alumni Quad. Wallets
belonging to roommates Janene
Higgins and Nancy Dunlop were
reported missing shortly after 4:45
pm. The wallets contained no
money. Howaver. both wallets had
personal effects such as Social
Security cards and permits that
must be replaced.

Higgins described the incident,
“1 stepped next door leaving my
door closed by unlocked. l was just
gone for about 60 seconds. When i
returned, there was a black male in
my room. He said he was looking
for Donna Dowitt. i told him to go
to the R.A. and hejust split. i asked
the R.A. and she said there is no
Donna Dowitt on the records. We
called the campus police and they
came over very quickly. They really
lectured us on the importance of
locking our doors and windows. We
lock our window and door all the
time now."

Higgins described the uniden-
tified thief to be approximately ﬁve
feet, ll inches in height, and

slender. He has short hair and was ,

wearing a cream-colored shirt and
jeans that appeared to be new.
The unidentified man reportedly

be voted on in the Spring. The
original bill provided for only “a
single proposal” to be introduced
~for voting. This amendment was
also passed.

Student Association President
Sue Gold is pleased with the vote,
but is not “overly optimistic.

“The vote made a positive state-
ment about the necessity of student
participation in the University
governance prOCcss. Many faculty
came out to support student
representation  but we can’t
assume the fight is over," site said.

Registration
continued from page three
studies, between 15-30 percent did
not register.

Yet the Selective Service says 93
percent of those eligible did
register.

The reason for this. Betz believes,
is that the Selective Service only has
the resources to contact about seven
percent of the nearly four million 19
and 20-year-olds who were suppos-
ed to have registered. The Selective
Service plans to contact those who
didn't register. he explains, and
since their resources permit them to

reach only seven percent ofthe peo-
pie, this is the percentage they
declare as unregistered.

Whatever the percentages concer-
ning summer regis ration, it is cer-
tain that there will e those who will
register this January. SASU and
Student Union will be doing
everything they can to keep the

register level as low as possible.

also entered another roorn tn the
hall: however, nothing was stolen.

In response to such on-campus
thefts, O'Connor, along with the
Supervisor Student Patrol Andrew
Panzer, urges campus residents to
look for students who seem to be
-:onfused, disoriented, or sneaking
around. O'Connor added that a
person charged with loitering is
liable either for an overnight stay in
jail or $100 bail and a sentence oi
up to is days in jail.

O’Connor said that SUNYA, be-
ing close to the city, has an environ-
ment that is conducive to
burglaries. Many drifters hitching
‘hrough this city ﬁnd the campus a
tonvenient spot to get food, rest,

1nd possibly a $2,000 stereo system .

—- not to mention cash, jewelry,
clock radios, and other valuables
owned by students.

Dinnertime is a prime time for
burglars to snag articles from the
dorm rooms and suites. Rooms left
unlocked and vacant provides op-
portunities for theft. O'Connor
noted that taking ﬁve minutes to
lock your doors or engrave property
can save hours of time replacing
goods.

Security has scheduled prOgrams
in each dorm providing students
with Operation Identification
Numbers, engraving pens, and facts
on personal crime prevention.

Operation identification is run by
the New York State Municipal
Police under the N.Y.S. System of
Crime Prevention. Each person is
given a N.Y.S. code number and an
individual identification code to
engrave on their personal property.
The identification numbers are on a
nationwide ﬁle insuring the owners

,thc chance to recover stolen goods

that are found anywhere at
anytime.

@p And Gown Firm (20323,

by Lillian Pearsall

Cotrell and Leonard, the Albany firm which has supplied caps am}
gowns for SUNYA for over 30 years. Is going out of business. Company of.
ficials announced the ﬁrm was closing because of an inability to compete in
the modern market. L

The closing comes on the heels of a strike of over a year’s duration by up.
proximately 30 of the company's garment workers, supported by the Inter:
national Ladies Garment Workers Union (lLGWU). The strike was begunl
to protest what was called the company’s anti-union campaign.

lLGWU representatives met early last spring with SUNYA officials,
seeking support for the strikers through a boycott of Cotrell and Leonard'k
caps and gowns. They asked that the factory’s decrepid condition also hL‘
considered, although the strike was for anti-union activities. University or.
ﬁcials declined support.

Cotrell and Leonard’s manager, Anthony Harden, said that the factory, .
located at 472 Broadway, is closing because I‘our building is not suitable
for continued manufacturing in today's competitive market." Harden snid‘
the company is trying to sell its assets. and dues not intend to reopen
elsewhere.

The lLGWU is now trying to ﬁnd another manufacturer to take over the
business. Edward Nash, lLGWU district manager, said “we’ve comumd
some of Cotrell and Leonard’s competitors, but they weren’t interested.i
We're still trying." Nash says the union is presently trying to ﬁnd jobs rm.

departments were encouraged to
establish and maintain an equity
between the number of men's and
women's varsity sports.

“Our current numbers, ten
women’s sports and ten men’s are
very defe‘ndable numbers. Now Is
not the time to add men's or take
away women’s sports."

Ford said that among other fac-
tors in the decision were indications
last year that Ted Earl was thinking
of accepting another job. The rise
of women’s soccer, soon to be a
varsity sport. also contributed to
the decision.

As far as the discussed alter-
natives, Ford said the use of a
volutecr coach was “unrealistic” at
the university level.

Concerning the fundraising, re-
quests for community appeals are
handled through Administration.
and sports have a low priority in

‘ that concern. he said.

An alternative now open to the
players Is the chance to play as an
SA funded club. as do the Universi-
ty’s water polo and rugby teams.
Ford says the team would play on
an equally competitive level as
before, but on a'more informal
basis.
