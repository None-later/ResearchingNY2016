Appliance stores
and department stores
are not the best places
to buy quality stereo.
You'll do much better at
a stereo store.

The problem is. '
which stereo store" You're about
to read why over 2 million music
lovers have decided to buy from
Tech Hifi.

It’s OK
to pick our brains.
(We know our stereo).

’l‘he salespeople at Tech Hil'i
know what they‘re talking about.
They work at Tech because they
love stereo. not because they
love selling.

Our people keep up with all
the latest equipment. and can tell
you the differences among the
leading brands.

You get to play -
at Tech Hifi, not just look.

Some stereo stores have
signs all over that tell you
"Don't Touch The Merchandise".

At 'l‘ech Hifi our signs say
"Come Play." We cncdurage you
to spin knobs. push buttons. toss
switches. and try out any of the
components in our soundroom.

ll‘you take'enough time to play
in a Tech l-Iifi soundrooni. you‘ll
get a good idea of which
equipment sounds best in your
price range.

This $185) system delivers gcorl sound at a low price.
The receiver is a 'l‘l)C 1500 with ’I‘—liuck tuning that eliminates I"

  

The buying power of the
65 Tech Hifi stores.

The reason why no store has
better prices than ’l‘ech Hifi is no
dealer buys quality components
in such a huge volume as the 65
Tech Hifi stores.

You‘ll find our prices are as
good as anybody‘s. and often
better on some brands.

You might expect to pay
extra at Tech for all the extra
things we offer. But you won't.

At Tech Hifi we back
what you buy.

When you make any big
investment like quality hil'i.
make sure you're getting sound
guarantees.

Tech Hll'i gives you guaran-
tees most stores don't.
And we'll give them to
you in writing. right on
your sales slip.

Our guarantees
include a 7-day
moneyback
guarantee
(no questions
asked).
