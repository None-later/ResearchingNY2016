Slumping ticket sales at rock con-
certs may signal the end to those so-
called "rider" clauses in the con-
tracts of touring rock groups.

Rider clauses are special side
agreements in which the promoters
promise to provide back-stage ex-
tras for the musicians during a
show.

For example, the Grateful Dead
used to demand steak and lobster
for 20 people; Pink Floyd once
demanded and got a miniature golf
putting course. ping-pong and pool
tables, pinball machines, and im-
ported caviar — all backstage; and
Meatloaf always requests to have
cases of warm beer on hand.

The Washington Post reports,
however, that ridcr clauses have
gotten out of hand in recent years,
with some of the contracts running
with 20 extra pages of special
demands. The Post says that the
rider demands alone often cost a
promoter an additional $2,000 to
$4,000 per show.

Goodbye Gloria!

There’s bad news for those of
you whose blucjcans hear such
status symbol names as “Gloria

Those names are being “bumped
from the rump," says the Chicago
Tribune. to make way for a new
type of signature: those of country
and western celebrities.

Already hot items are “Gilley's”
jeans, named after Mickey Gilley,
the country and western singer who
owns the bar made famous by the
movie Urban Cowboy.

Love Sick

Falling in love is good for your
health...but only if you don’t do it
too often.

Two St. Johns University
sociologists say they have
discovered that people with the best
health are those who have fallen in
love only one, two, or three times.

Roslyn Wallach Bologh, in a
26-page thesis delivered to the at
nual meeting of the American.
Sociological Association, report

that persons who have never fallen

in love are likely to suffer from
“bodily disorders, pains. and fears
about ill health.”

They add that people who fall in
love again and again tend to regard
their romantic lives as “personal
failures.” Such people feel bad
about themselves. the professors
say, causing health problems.

Fries and Highs

A federal court in Boston has
halted the sale of T-shirts which
linked the McDonald’s corporation
to the use of marijuana.

The shirts in question feature a
giant yellow “M” similar in style to
the McDonald’s arches, and carry
the slogan: "Marijuana: Over to
Billion Stoned."

A McDonald’s vice president
complained to the court that
McDonald's had, in his words,
“spent an enormous amount of
money and time to develop an im-

-age of quality, friendliness, and
'whoicsomeness to the American
public." U.S. District Judge David
Nelson upheld McDonald's com-
plaint and ordered several Boston
shops to stop selling the T-shirts.

McDonald's had another drug-
related problem recently when the
company ordered the redesign of its
coffee spoons after it was learned
that the white plastic stirrcrs were

popular with cocaine users.

Athletes Up To It

Scoring, sexually that is, before a
big game or athletic match, doesn’t
affect an athlete's performance or
the outcome of the sports event.

For years, coaches and sports
managers have kept players isolated
from their spouses or males the

 

  

night before a big game to insure
that the athletes won’t be too tired
to perform well. 7
However, now Dr. Donald
Cooper of the Oklahoma State
University Hospital and Clinic in
Stillwater says that abstaining from
sexual activity before the big game
or event is simply “part of the
mystique known as the All
American Boy syndrome.”

 

'31 -' "

Cooper says, to the contrary, that
sex before a game “if it would help
relax some tension and make it
possible for an athlete to sleep bet-
ter, could possibly be considered a
slight benefit."

Coining Hippie

Have you ever wondered just ex-
actly what a “hippy” really is“
Well, the government of Sri
Lanka, which has reportedly
become the latest playground of
“hippies,” has just adopted an of-
ﬁcial definition of “hippy.”
According to Parade magazine,
Sri Lanka says that a “hippy” is
any person who is “untidy. long-
haircd, wears dirty shorts and
T-shirts, goes barefoot, or iii sari-
dals, and smells unclean." in the
case of a female, the dcfinitiort also
includes anyone who doesn't wear a
bra.
Parade says, however. that sinccl’,

thc official definition is posted at
airports, the real "hippies" are
making sure to dress neatly and
conventionally to avoid‘lmmigra-
tlon harassment.

Martinez Accused

continued from page one

Newmark verified Somach's
statement, saying that Martinez
would not admit how the mileage
was added, but accepted respon-
sibility for the van.

While Newmark said that
Weinstock was present when Mar-
tinez agreed to pay SA back
Weinstock now asserts that Mar-
tinez used the van for “SA related
business."

“The (SA) vice president is in
charge of the SA van," according
to current SA vice president Brian
Levy. "He has access to it
anytime." However, according to
SA policy, the van may only be used
for SA business.

“From what i hear from many
sources . . . Tito took the van out
on weekends for his personal use,"
Levy said. Levy also reported that a
friend saw Martinez use the van for
an evening at the Gemini Jazz Cafe.

Due to “incredible incidents of
van abuse" such as breakage and ir-
responsibility, Levy is now working
on a policy for presentation to Cen-
tral Council next month “that will
reﬂect a policy of austerity with the
van.”

SA will start asking SA groups to
stop requesting use of the van
unless absolutely necessary, and will
keep track of drivers, their licenses,
and the condition in which they
leave the vehicle, Levy said.

He also said that Central Council
has authorized SA to trade in the
van for a new car.
