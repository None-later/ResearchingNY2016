' New Year, New MeanirLtL

Amy Kantor

Last week was a special Jewish New Year
for me. i watched most of my'quad empty
out. and. from the Penthouse in Livingston
Tower. i saw students gathering in the cir-
cle. and the buses that came to take them
home.

But i did not want to go back to New
York City. the antithesis of a New York
Jew returning to Brooklyn. I had sinned.
you might say. i had ignored the religion
and criticzed it as a substitution of meaning
for its followers. But last Wednesday. in the
serenity of a near deserted campus, 1 allow-
ed my reaffirmation. I gave the religion
another chance.

So i felt i should remain up here because
at home there would be too much diverting
me from the observation of Rosh Hashana.
As my roommate left, she asked. “Don't
your parents make a big deal out of the
holiday?" “They used to. Jo. but things
changed; my grandparents got sick. close
relatives took reservations in the Catskills.
Hebrew schoor friends of my brother and i
moved to Lot ,' island. We got lazy. We got
apathetic. We forgot."

And now i almost can't remember.

First I watched my grandntother make
her owrt horseradish and helped her grate
the heels. She unfolded the giant
aluminium table and arranged fifteen
places. Then she brotigltt out coursc after
course of stewed and steartted pots. We
slept irt her apartment on the corner of
Ocean Parkway and Kings Highway, itt my
mother's old bedroom and sltuddered wat-
ching the shadows of atttbulance sirens
flash against the closed wall, as they zoom-
ed to and from Coney island Hospital.

in the morning, my brother Lee and i
would jump into bed with grandma arid
grandpa. and titcn eat rnatzoh brie with lots
of sugar. We walked up the Highway with
Grandpa. always stopping at the Cycle
Town window and always drooling over the
Schwinn 5-spceds we never got. We crossed
over to the Aperian Manor which was next
to a pornographic movie theater. and the
Citgo Gas Station where we bought plastic
model cars.

Later. we spent Rosh Hashanas at our
own house. and dressed up in patent leather
shoes which were the greatest for sliding
across the lobby of Nacitlom Zion. l sat
with the other children on the steps of the
pulpit and watched my neighbors praying.

My parents sent us to Hebrew school.
which we all found repressive and inconvie-
nent. By 1974. 1 associated my Bat Mitzvah

with freedom from the religion. and my
belief. which was so forced. began to
lessen. At Lee's Bar Mitzvah. two years
later, i prayed in temple for the last titne.

I thought religion lost its place in my life.
'My parents had stopped enforcing many
traditions and l lit my Bat Mitzvah candle
with indifference on the Friday evenings l
remembered it.

I studied Thoreau and thought people
should be their own gods. i read Melville.
but didn't realize Moby Dick was based on
the Old Testament. i found more meaning
from the poetry of Jackson BrOWne than
any rabbi. and i worshipped nothing short
of my own experiences and dreams.

l was brought to church and met people
with an even greater guilt complex titan l
possessed myself. Later. a close Jewish
friend expanded her interest in Jesus and
Christianity. She spoke as having two
religions. and insisted she wasn’t a ‘ch For
Jesus.’

This hit tne like a bombshell. it was a
tittte when my world was crashed by cori-
scctttive personal disasters for almost five
months. These problems were so far remov-
ed frottt religion tltat l ettdcd up blaming it
instead. A dissettter receiving ltcr punish-
ment.

So i spent the summer living quietly.
gaining back cttergy arid rearranging some
shattered ideals. l read about good and e\il;
about Michael and Lucifer. tutti about peo-
ple with human prejudices. needs and
desires. I found religion there. on almost
every page.

i decided to stay in Albany for the holi—
day on the morning Delta Sigma Pi bus
tickets went on sale. lplanncd to intend the
JSC-Hillel services for Rosh Hashana that
Wednesday evening. arid l ettjoycd it so
tttttclt I went back again Thursday morning.
The celebration was called liberal. and the
simplicity was elegant. We each read por-
tions of prayers aloud and a guitarist played
sortie of the most melodic cltord ar»
rangetnents l‘ve ever heard.

The holiday gave me a feeling of belong-
ing and peace that i haven't experienced itt
years. i missed my family like mad, bttt it
was important to find security by myself. i
never felt alone because i was with my peo-
ple. and I knew that all around the world
tltcy were celebrating this lndian summer
day as they have been for 574] years. i was
thinking it was so wonderful for this to be
happening — for the Jews to survive for so
long — and for Inc to survive as a Jew.

Department’s conclusion
of the Pupil Evaluation Program for the
1979-80 school year indicate that pupil
achievement itt rcadirtg rind mathemattcs
continues to improve". A PTCIlfnmarY
analysis of the data gives .Captlalﬂnd
parents no cause for easy opttntrsm. I

Among sixth graders tested last fall in the
Albany city schools ﬁfty-seVen percent
scored below the State Reference Form In
reading and thirty-seven percent scored
very far below. A score below the reference
poirtt indicated a need for remedial
assistance. in the Schenectady and Troy
districts the percentage of sixth graders
testing below the norm irt reading was forty-
four percent and fifty-two percent respec-
tively. in mathematics forty-four percent of
the sixth graders in the Albany district
scored below the SRI’.

Since statewide only thirty-nine percent
of sixth graders scored below the norm itt
reading. Albany students are far behind.
'l‘hcy compare even worse when you
average iii the suburban districts itt Albany
County. (‘ounty-wide about a tltird of the
students scoer below the Slil’ in reading.

Ill eight of the twelve schools in the City
of Albany where sixth graders were tested
for rcadirtg skills. more tltatt ltalf of the
students scored below the SRI’. The schools
where this poor reading acheivcntcnt occurs
are located itt neighborhoods with the
highest enrolltttertt of students from while
working class and black families.

facts don't speak for themselves. They
need careful interpretation. But the tett
billiott dollars per year itt state and local
taxes for elementary and secondary educa-
tiott irt New York do not seem to help the
children of these fatttilics. 'l'hese reading
achievement results rather indicate the dirty
little secret of continuing social inequality
in our society and forecast future social
problems.

The Students’ Choice

To The Editor:

lrt regards to your article concerning
ROTC on campus which appeared iii the
ASl’datcd 9 Sept. ill). I feel that you are ex-
pressing your desire to keep students. frottt
enlisting of their own free will and by their
own right, through opposing the program.
if ttot for ROTC. tltcrc would be fewer
fcntalc arid black officers in tire Arttty titan
tltcrc are today. Once a program is started.
it is each indivitlual's cltoicc as to sign the
contract for service or not. livery studcttt

Students should have the same right to
take ROTC as those who oppose it haw rm-

Just because parents and rcsistcrs are
against the program doesn‘t mean that you
should take away the right of choice which
the students have. i suggest that you take 4,
poll — an honest one — and determine
whether or not there is an interest in lilt.‘
program on campus. instead of uncovering
the background of the mysterious pol]
which you referred to so often in your ttt’ti-
clc.

i also suggest that those who wish to
enlist find out more about the available
MOS’s offered by the Arnty. it is better to
take the enlistment exam before [linking rr
