In a self-spun "reverie, minding my own
business. acting highly disinterested in all
those conversations and goings-on about
me, he walks up to me, right up to me, plops
down his books, on top of mine, no less (was
)he hoping to impress me with those foreign
titles which probably mean “How to pick up
Girls" or possibly "Guide for Voyeurs"),
smiles at me and In his best Al Pacino says.
“Aren't you In my 426?“ i '

Flashing my iclest stare, teeth bared, Intent
on conveying nonverbally that l was neither
interested ln pursuing this line of conversa-
tion. nor in the investigation oi possible
translations of those words that were inciting
xenophobic rancor In my B negative blood, l
responded. blase: “Yeah, l suppose."

l had no intention whatsoever of accepting
his garish invitation to dine; nor had i even
faint desire of continuing dialogue with this
new wave Phllistlne, yet I must admit. in
defense of what‘s fair, that such vlchyssolse
was never before supped; the asparagus
souffle was pure poetry; and the cinnamon
orgasm cake was indeed lust dessert.

Tossing symbolic wine glasses to the
hearth, we snuggled for warmth on a worn
Persian rug. Toasting healths and mar-
shmallows, we read verse aloud and told
each secrets. .

A Confusing Dorm Deal '

The recent dormitory rate increase and ensuing controversy around it is sudden
and seems overly complex.
The factions split in defense of the move toward university housing self-
_sufﬁClenC)’ and those opposed to it are at opposite ends of arguments, issues. and
facts. It’s becoming increasingly hard to determine just who’s for real and what's
actually at stake.
While the notion of moving SUNY’s housing into financial independence is a
commendable one, we must question whether SUNY’s students can dish out the
money.

What brought many students into the system in the first place was SUNY’s '

pledge of low-cost, high-quality education. if it can no longer meet this end, then
it may be losing its initial reason to exist.

The Board of Trustees and the Chancellor believe that, even under no pressure
to do so from the state, the move toward dormitory self-sufficiency will create
more money for academics.

But how can we be certain that the Legislature will channel this money into that
area of concern? As talks of further tuition cuts and budget cuts will undoubtedly
arise this year, the Board could be engaged in their own neck-slicing right now.

They also sight inﬂation as a reason for their decision. While we won’t be
foolish to debate the continuing high cost of living in the state and the country, an
increase of $150 per year for four years does not appear to be keeping up with our
current rate of inﬂation.

While off-campus living was once considcrcd a financial luxury, ii is now
cheaper, at least in this city, to share a room in an apartment outside the dor-

‘mitorics.

Perhaps our biggest complaint is ilic timing of the increase.

The Chancellor and Board of Trustees. in u quasi-closcd-door inccting without
much student input, appear to have rushed Ihcir decisions. Students had already
dispersed for the summer ni’lcr signing housing contracts for a determined
amount. When they received notices this summer of the increase, those on stoic
financial aid were out of luck. The forms were processed and impossible to alter.
Even though students were offered 0an release from their housing contract.
August is rather late to take advantage of it.

SUNYA students , howcvci'. were fortunate duc to the sliurpncss ol' Ihc Finan-
cial Aids office who, quickly adding the ncw rnlc into students' packets. snvcd
them personal costs. ,

But in most other SUNY schools, the $150 will comc righi out of the lining of
empty students‘ pockets.

Surely the Trustees could have nl lcusi waited until the next scmcslcr or school
year to debate and vote on the issue before hitting most students with a chargc

 

     

for which they were unable to get assistance.
And if, as Chairman Donald Blinken insists, the trustees did not know of the
issue until the day before their May meeting, how could they have acted on the
:complcx proposal so darn fast?
It even “shocked” SUNYA's Acting Director of Residences, Paul Doyle, who
{claims he was given no prior knowledge of the hike.
SUNYA’s Vice Chancellor for Finance and Business, Harold Spindler,
ldisputcs this and feels that plans for the hike had been publicly discussed “since
January." Which brings us back to Blinken, and the question: Why didn’t we
receive any announcements prior to May? ‘
Confused? So are we. And regardless of whether the hike will turn out to be
‘good’ or ‘bad,’ we can clearly conclude that the process toward it was a
.shambles.

Bus System in Ruins

Few will deny that the SUNYA bus service is attrocious at cht.‘And as
semesters begin, year after year, the system continues to corrode.

One student, returning from a year of study in Paris, told the ASP he was
amazed at the rise of inadequacy the service has attained since he left. And he has
a right to be so amazed.

One needs only to spend time using the ‘scrvice' to see just how poor it really is.
More and more students are getting into classrooms late, some are forced to miss
them altogether as they gaze at stuffed buses whizzing past on their way to the
campus; buses which often exceed the legal load of riders.

The Plant Department claims that the main reason for the latest deterioration
is due to mandatory budget cuts, causing the loss of two drivers. They now have
more buses than drivers to operate them.

But a Plant Department source, who asked not to be identiﬁed. claims that the
two drivers had quit —— and three more were hired. And 1980 employment records
list the names of 22, not the 20, drivers the department has claimed.

So what is the real problem? We’re not too sure but a large number of bus
drivers are quick to point their fingers and their mouths at the management.

Wherever the problem actually lies. one thing is more certain now than ever
before —- it nccds to be solved. Service is decreasing and eroding as the downtown
population continues to expand.

Since we feel that the university has failed to recognize the dire seriousness of
the situation, the ASP suggests that administrators and Plant Department of-
ficials ride the buses to work each day for a week.

We‘re certain that after arriving to campus with ruffled suits and missed ap-
pointments, our leaders would soon opt for taxis.

But regardless, go on and give it a try. Just one week. We darcyou.

And to the downtown students who are bccoming so disillusioned, wc beg you
to voice your complaints to thc administration and to the Plant Department. The
number is 457-8422. Ask for Dennis Stcvcns. He's in charge there. And the only
way he can understand what's wrong is if you tell him.

At a meeting on Alumni Quad Tuesday night. Mr. Stevens pledged he would
“end the practice of bus drivers taking breaks during peak periods." Well, it’s
about time.
