A Polity senator and 'a PASBO leader both insist that the
letter. stating their obligations to A.A. by-laws. was even
"condemned" at a June 23rd meeting of the Polity Coun-
cil. Zuckerman has rebuffed the claims.

Rejects Marburger's proposal

According to the Statesman. Zuckcrman has refused
Marbergcr’s “interim” budget plan for legal reasons. He
feels that operating on a partly-cenii‘icd budget “would
have opened up Polity and myself and the university to
lawsuits." ‘

Instead. Zuckerman wants all of the funds restored.

. Justice Department to visit

Meanwhile. PASBO leader and the initiator of the
original charges. Frank Jackson. is unhappy with Zuckcr-
man’s rejection of "interim" proposal.

“It is not us. it is not the president that's stopping ac-
tivities now. it is Richard Zuckcrman who is." he said.

According to the Statesman. Jackson said he had con-
tacted the U.S. Justice Department and that it will conduct
an investigation on the campus this week.

'1 Looking ahead

“Stony Brook is a funny mixture of things that are done
very well and things that are muddled through." Mar-
burgcr explained to the Statesman. He expressed a strong

"continued from page three

, desire to “got started oti reorganizing the university.‘

And while those involved search for solutions to SUNY
Stony Brook’s early problems. its students, with no Clubs to
join, nor booze to guzzlc. have few other places to turn —
but the books.
