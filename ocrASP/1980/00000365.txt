BEER THAT 0
OTHERS IN

by Eric Gruber

in their first match of the fall
season, the Albany women's varsi-
ty tennis team narrowly defeated ar-
chrival Binghamton 4-3 at Albany
last Tuesday.

Playing for the Danes in the
number one spot was sophomore
Nancy Light, who beat her oppo-
nent Leslie Fagenson. 6-3, 6-3.

Albany varsity coach Peggy
Mann feels that Light, despite her
win, did not play as well as she
could. and that it will take another
week before she returns to top
form.

Light became Albany's number
one player last year when Lisa
Denenmark was sidelined with an if
lncss. Dcncnmark, called by Mann
“the ﬁnest player I've ever coach-
ed." has not returned this year due
to outside commitments.

In the number two spot was
freshman Cari Solomon who, in her
ﬁrst collegiate match, defeated

LABATT’S.

Good news!

bbatts, Canada's No. lsellin

[Binghamton's Tracey Bauer, 6-l.
6-3.

Solomon. who played in tour-
naments this summer, was
characterized by Mann as “a very
calm player, who does not get
upset." This control on the court is
reflected in Solomon’s very low
forced error percentage.

Team captain, senior Sue Bard,
playing in the third spot. beat her
opponent Laurie Gurney, 6-3, 6—1.

Mann, who nicknamed Bard

“the human backboard,” explain-

ed that the key to the captain's suc-
cess is a “less aggresive game
where Sue concentrates on return-
ing each shot and forcing the other
player into making a mistake.”
, Last year’s number two player,
junior Anne Newman, down to the
number four spot. lost to Bingham-
ton‘s Karen Karlewicz. l-6, 0-6.

Newman played very little tennis
this summer and is not yet back into
form. Mann feels that the major
thing missing in Newman's game at
this point is consistency.

Sophomore Elise Solomon, elder
sister of teammate Cari, defeated
Binghamton’s Bonnie Koppelman.

LITSE!
CANADA:

g beer, is now imported to the U. 5.

So, now it's easier to try our Labatt's—ahd understand the secnet

of its popularity
We think you

truly,

’ll discover a taste that's crisp, clean and natural—

the beer that tastes as good as the country it comes from“

.ln doubles competition, Albany’s
IAmy Feinberg and Joan Phillips
lost to Val Athens and Sharon
Levine of Binghamton, 1-6, 0-6.
Meanwhile. the Albany duo of Pain
Duchin and Laura Isaaes had trou-
Ible with Binghamton's Sue Man-
'chester and Erica Litsky, losing 1-6.
.l-6.

ln doubles play “both players
lmust feel comfortable with. and
lconﬁdent of, their partners' play,”
:explained Mann. “With two weeks,
of practice, this just never happen-
ed. Furthermore, except for
sophomore Amy Feinberg, the
other three girls were playing in
their ﬁrst collegiate match, " she ad-

ed.

In addition to the nine girls who
played Tuesday, three more girls
round out the varsity team. Chris
Rodgers, Sandra Borrelle and Nan-
cy Levine. “All of these girls are

‘competent players —- i've just got‘

to ﬁnd the right slots and combina—
tions for each,” explained Mann as
site looked over her roster and plan-
ned for the week ahead.

The coach feels that St. Lawrence
is going to be their toughest com-
petition but does not discount any
of the competition as easy. She is
particularly interested in Amherst.
rwhom Albany has never played,
and who Mann knows little about.

The adjective varsity is an im-
portant addition to the team this
year. For the first time in four
years, there is a women's junior
lvarsity tennis squad.

The new J.V. squad is made up

of 10 players and their coach, Britta
Mc Cawley. Mann plans to use this
team as a building block for the
future. The jayvces opened their
,sclicdule Wednesday against
lCobleskill.
' As for the varsity. Mann is very
ihappy. She has a strong young team
'with much depth' for the future.
And she is confident of maintaining
her unbroken streak of winning
seasons. The only thing that Mann
lfeels the team can use now is a
l“stronger feeling of team spirit and
unity." She is confident that, like a
lfine wine, “This will improve with
lime."

Harriers Lose

ronliruwd from page 15

'4 enough to beat us."

Munsey noted that the Coast
Guard meet was “for a lot of guys
their first real look at college runn—
ing. There is a lot of raw talent of

this team with the makings of some

fine runners."
The Harriers jump on the bus for

' Syracuse Saturday, to face Army,

East Stroudsburg State and

' Syracuse.

Munsey feels that his top man.

‘Seott James can fare quite well

against these powerful adversaries:
“I think it will be interesting to see
I'Wllill Scott can do versus top class
runners. There is a lot of class com-
petition in this race. He's looking
foward to it. He'll run his tail~end
loff."

“Competition like this brings you
up to another level of performance
standards. These guys are getting
paid to run by way of scholarships.
Running against these teams is great
because running against everything
else is a piece of cake,” said James.
