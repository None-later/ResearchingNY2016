loss to the 1979 Division 111 Na-;I

There was the uncommon occur-
rence of a Chuck Priore fumble on
the Albany seven yardline. lthaca's
Frank Cogliandro recovered the
loose ball. and the Bombers scored
two plays later.

There was lthaca's Jim Duncan
streaking down the sideline past
Albany's-Don Bowen on a fourth-
and-20 from the Danes’ 32 yardline
with 1:27 remaining in the first half
and grabbing quarterback Doug De
Carr's pass for a Bomber
touchdown. '

"We made sotne mistakes 1 said
we couldn't afford to make." said
Albany head coach Bob it‘ord.

There were others. Three pir-

backs. None of these were lost. but

Ford was disgruntled by the loss,
but wasn't disgusted. noting that
the Danes hustled on every play. If
the mistakes could be taken away.
Ford felt that the game could've
been a different story.

Albany did do many things cor-
rectly. though, including
outrushing lthucu (241 ytrrds to 226
yards). Dunc quarterback coach

opening team they’ve played. The
Albany secondary picked off three
passes. Bowen had two of those
(one on a diving over-the-shoulder
grab in the endzone). and Dave
Hardy had the other (on the goal
line). Both prevented potential
touchdowns. Albany quarterback
Mike Fiorito was eight for 15 pass-
ing. for 107 yards, fulﬁlling Ford's
pre-game speculation that “We
don't have to throw more; we have
to throw better.”

Albany trad to punt on their irr-
itial possession. but Bowen in-

tercepted a DeCarr pass on ltlraca's '

sive support in) arid got fortr yards

The second period was quiet until
Albany. behind Fiorito and the of-
fensive line, engineered the ﬁrst of
two long Dane drives. Starting on
their own 25 yardlinc, Albany mar-
ched 75 yards, capped by a Fiorito

Hold Up Under Pressure;

Depth The Key to Success

 

by Larry Kahn

The Albany State men’s tennis
team got off to a roaring start this
season with two convincing vic-
tories in what ﬁgures to be an ex-
citing year. The young team held up
nicely in competition and proved
they have the depth to win the
tough matches.

On Tuesday, the netters smashed
Vermont, 7-2. at home in a match
that Albany clinched in the singles
competition. Last year Vermont
barely edged the Danes.‘ 5-4. in a
very hard fought match.

“i figured it would be a much
closer match." admitted Albany
tennis coach Bob Lewis. "Although
we won handily. Vermont is not a
bad team — a lot of good points
were played despite the lopsided
scores. 1 was very happy to clinch
the match in singles, but i didn't ex-
pect to."

' in the continuing battle for the
number one position on the Albany
ladder. Fred Guber (H) has emerg-
ed as the early leader, but Barry
Levine (H) is returning to last year's
form and freshman Rob Karen (2-0)
is challenging with a very strong
start. With a full week before their
next match there may be some
shake-ups as the team continues
their playoffs. “The players at one.
two and three are very. very close,"
remarked Lewis. "i wouldn‘t be
surprised if there were some

changes."

in Tuesday's action, Gabcr
breezed through his match against
Bob McCredic itr straight sets. 6-1.
6-2. “Fred played extrenrely well."
commented Lewis. in second
singles, Levine ran itrto sonic tough
competition in Vermont's Phil Ab-
dalla. Abdallu broke Levine's serve
ﬁrst to take an early 3-2 lead. brrt
the Dane battled back to win, 6-4.
and then took the second set. 6-2.

“I'm happy to see Levine playing
well again." said Lewis. “He came
up against a very hard hitter. brrt be
lntng in there and started playing
with more confidence. Midway
through the second set he started
playing ntore like he is capable of
playing. though he’s not quite back
to where he was last year.”

ltr other solid performances. Rob
Karen crushed Chris Holmquist,
6-1.6-2. and Russell Kasow (l-l) won
his ﬁrst college match. 6-31.64.
“Rob played his second really good
match." noted Lewis. The lone
Albany loss in singles ctttrre iii the
fifth spot where Andy Diamond
(l-l) fell to Mike Bonfigli. 6—3.6«2.
“Andy played against a good
player," said Lewis. “He wusn’t at
his best -— be was tentative in the
match."

The most excltitrg match of the
day came from the bottom of the
ladder where Albany's Dave Lerner
(2vO) locked horns with Ed Bonﬁgll.
Lerner barely slid by iii the ﬁrst set.

7-6, btrt jumped to a commanding
5-2 lead in the second. Borrfigli got
tough. though, atrd lratrrtncrcd back
to tie it at five. He went on to win a
dramatic tiebrcaker with both
teams eagerly watching. The ﬁrst
and second doubles matches got
underway, but all for naught as
Lerner won the clincher, 6—4.
“Dave was down after the second
set." Lewis noted. “He deserves a
lot of credit for hanging in there."

Gaber and Levine did just
enough to win in ﬁrst doubles.
7—6.6-4. and Kasow teamed tip with
Rob Fritz in the third spot to defeat
the brothers Bonﬁgli. 8-2. in a late-
starting pro-set match. Vermont's
only other win came in second
doubles when Clark Wulff and Trip
Ward teamed rrp to beat Karen and
Dave Ulrich. 6-4.6-2.

in their first mtttclr of the season.
September 10, the Danes triumphed
over an excellent Oneonta team.
6‘3. “We were very fortunate to
win the match." said Lewis.
"They‘re a veteran tettrrr.
Everybody is back from last year
except ntrrrrber three and his
replacement is a very good player."

Albany exhibited their great
depth when Gabcr and Levine lost
at the top of the ladder. but were
able to compensate with wins from
Diamond and Lerner at the bottom.
“We lost at one and two and still
won the match because ﬁve and six
won. 1n the past if we lost one-two
we wouldn't have won."
said. “Depth will be our strength
for the year."

Karen also won in singles. but ‘

New York State students will be
barred from voting in their college
communities once again this year

' unless a federal judge declares a

state election law unconstitutional
before October 4. the deadline for
voter registration.

Reserving decision is U.S.
District Court Justice Neil P. Mc-

Albany. McL‘urn said he would
make rtp his mind “within the next

Mc('trr tr‘s decision will dctcrtnine
the corrstitutiorralily of section
17104 and 5-104 of the New York
State [Elections Law. which pctrrrits
local election boards to consider
factors such as rntrrltal status. age.
source of income. and residence of
parents in deciding the qualification
of an individual to vote itr an elec-
tion district.

McCurn said he will consider
arguments presented by the student
attorney and the state attorney
before rrrakitrg his decision.

According to SA Attorney Jack
Lester. the law violates 14th amend-
ment rights to eqtral protection and
2(rth amendment rights to due pro~

“The law is arbitrary and
vague." said Lester. "lt
discriminates against students by re-
quiting them to complete in-deptlr
questionnaires about their personal.
financial atrd errrploytrrerrt status.
No such questionnaires are giVen to
other citizens."

“As a result." said Lester,

“The statute is totally neutral,"

“1 am not familiar with other

This is not the first time the law
has been put to a constitutional test.
Similar cases have been brought
before both state atrd federal courts
since 1972. Throughout this eight-
ycar period. the law has been corr-

Attorney Lance Russell said he
sees no reason to believe there will

This particular case specifically

sion will have an impact on the en-

by the SUNYA Student Associa-

NYPIRG.

Legal counsel for the students is
provided by SA Attorney Jack
Lester. Paralegals, investigators,
and researchers are also employed.
Lester estimates that the entire cost
of the litigation will approach near-

SASU spokesperson l’arn Snook

$4.000 cost to be excessive. despite

who lives in a community ought to
be able to vote in that community.

“Students should be subject to

O'Lettry.

O‘Leary added, however. that he
is not sure about students who live
