Poll Shows Cable Interest

by Beth Sexer

The results of a referendum con-
ducted last spring semester and a
polling of incoming freshmen dur-
ing the summer orientation pro-
gram conclude that “a majority of
Students on tltis campus" are will-
ing to pay four dollars per semester
to install cable television in dorm
lounges, said SA Vice President
Brian Levy. ‘

According to Levy. who has been
working on this project for three
years, the referendum conducted
last year showed that 68 percent of
those students who voted, or 1400
students wanted cable television on
campus. However, in order for the

referendum to be considered, 35
percent of those eligible. or 1500
students, had to have voted.

Levy felt, though. that a positive
vote by 1400 students warranted a
polling of incoming freshmen. By
the end of the summer orientation
program, approximately 75 percent
of the freshmen questioned in-
dicated that they were in favor of
bringing cable television on cam-
pus.

The four dollar per semester fee
“will include installation costs.
yearly operating costs. loan
paybacks. and the cost of TV’s to
go in every dorm not presently
equipped with one," said Levy.

Archeological Dig is Popular With

The following is the first of a two
part series. Part Two will be printed
in Friday's issue.

A class of eighteen SUNYA
students devoted six weeks during
their summer vacation to digging in
an overgrown ﬁeld in Menands to
uncover evidence of prehistoric
human occupation of the area and
found artifacts that date back at
least 4,000 years.

Field Director Susan Bender. age
33. explained that it took two tries
to find what she was looking for as
supervisor of the ﬁeld school.
“People have this idea that ar-
chaeologists intuitively know where
to dig. but this just isn‘t so.” she
said. “Professor Dean Snow attd I
chose the sites we did in hopes of
gaining some knowledge about the

native population of the area. The
first site we chose as a good bet.
becuase it was in an area with many
known sites and was located on a
raised terrace next to a river. as are
many other area sites. The sccortd
site, about a mile away. was a fail-
safc. in case we didn't find anything
at the first. Portions of the second
site had previously been excavated.
so we already knew that we would
find things there."

The entire site. named “Troy 5."
covered an area of at least 3.000
square meters. and that was only
the portion of the site that had not
been removed for quarryittg and
construction of Route #787.
“Frequently. when people think of
a site. they think ofstructurcs. such
as buildittgs and tctttplcs, but. in the

SA Attempts to Increase
Frosh Involvement

by Bntce Levy
The Student Association is stepp-
ing up its efforts to increase

freshmen involvement in SA this
year, according to SA Vice Presi-
dent Brian Levy.

The ﬁrst step in the process began
this summer. with SA's
"mini-orientation" program. In-
terest forms were distributed to
freshmen at their summer planning
conferences.

Those who indicated interest in
SA on those forms. according to
Assistant Council Chair Artic
Banks. will be contacted to attend
mini-orientations where they will be
given various tasks to get them
started in SA.

In addition to these plans, SA is
aiding other organizations which
draw freshmen members. They
have compiled lists for each group

‘ of students who indicated an in-

terest in those organizations on the
summer forms. SA Vice-president
Brian Levy is “strongly suggesting
that group leaders call all the phone
numbers on the lists to explain to
the freshmen about their groups.”

However, some freshmen are still
unsure about extra-curricular in-
volvements. One student. Mary
Streb, indicated that she would be
interested in Joining activities. but
had no idea how. Another
freshman. Rob Breckinridge.
stated that he wants to get set in his
classes before he takes on addi-
tional responsibilities.

Freshmen ean ﬁnd information
around campus in a variety of ways,
said Levy. Levy urges freshmen to
watch for the 8" by 11" posters
hung around campus. and for.

advertisements in the ASP and
other publications. He said students
should make an effort to contact
group leaders attd members to fittd
out more about their clubs.

Hudson Valley area. there is little
evidence on the surface of the
ground to indicate that humans
were ever there prehistorically,”
Bender explained.

Before going out lit the ﬁeld. the
students Itad taken a three week
preparatory course to learn what
they would be doing at the site and
a little about what they might be
finding. After purchasing the
necessary mason‘s trowel. metric
tape ttteasure. indelible pen. and
heavy duty insect repellant. the
students were ready for the excava-
tion.

The trip to Mcnattds was an easy
one; however. reaching the site in-
volved a considerable bike. The
students wisely wore long pants as
they threaded single file through
five- to six-foot high weeds for
about three quarters ofa mile. Once
reached, the site had to be cleared
of weeds. bushes. and large rocks.
Arntcd with scytltes, hedge trim-
mers. and a lot of elbow grease, the
students began to put their ar-
chaeological talent to work.

“We were ntost interested in fin-
ding evidence of the Archaic period
(8000—1500 B.C.)," Bender said.

  

“Historically, the people that in-
habited the area were called
Mahicans. They spoke an
Algonkian language and hunted
and gathered food from their on-
vironmcnt, as well as cultivated a
variety of domestic plants.

“Local residents gave us infor-
mation about the recent history of
the sites. telling us about construc-
tion and other forms of utilization
that migltt have influenced what we
would ﬁnd at each. Art Johnson.

Candidates Debate Inflation, Energy

by Susan Mllllgan

Presidential can-
didate John Anderson and
Republicutt nominee Ronald
Reagan took the opportunity Sun-

news FEATURE

day night to air their respective plat-
forms. take mild jabs at each other,
and rctnind viewers of the con-
spicuous absence of President
Carter in a Baltimore debate spott-
sored by the Leaguc of Women
Voters.

Agreeing only on their opposition
to a peacetime draft. the Presiden-
tial hopefuls clashed on economic
issues. energy policy and conserva-
tion, and the degree of Inﬂuence
organized religion might hold in
Presidential decisions.

The candidates were asked ﬁrst
what “politically unpopular
measures" they would take to curb
inflation. Anderson, after noting
that “Carter should be here to
answer those questions. . .attd is
not." attacked Reagan’s promise
forla 30% across-the-board tax cut
as "irresponsible," and outlined his

Ittdcpcndcnt

 

 

own plan for an "emergency excise
tax" on gasoline.

Anderson has proposed $11.3
billion of spending cttts and a 50¢
increase in gasoline prices. the pro-
cccds to be rebatcd to consumers in
a 50% decrease in Social Security
taxes.

“This is no time for a tax
cut. . .wltcn we are confrontittg a
budget deficit this year of $60
billion." Anderson said.

Reagan. consistent with his Jef-
fcrsoniatt “the government that
governs least. governs best” view of
the role of the federal government.
defended his 30% tax cut proposal.
The former California governor
said “a phased-in 3-year tax cut
would give industry the
capital. . .to refurbish its plant and
produce ntorc.

"Inflation is dtte to the govern-
ment spending tnorc titan it takes
in," he said, adding that his plan
“would result itt a balanced bttdgct
by 1983."

Reagan said ltc knew that both
Anderson and Carter thought his
plan inflationary, but that ht:
“didn't see why it's Inllatiottary to
give people greater control over

their earnings."

Reagan added pointedly that
“John (Anderson) advocated a tax
cut 15 months ago. . .and said it
wouldn't be inflationary."

The two candidates were asked
what change itt lifestyle they might
advocate to case the problem of
diminishing resources.

Reagan, quipping that Itc
“wouldn’t be called a conservative
if he didn‘t believe in conserva-
tion." said that while
:‘conservation is worthy in itself. it
Is not the answer to the problem.

“It is only slaving off the day
when we will come to the end of our
energy supply," he said.

Reagan said that the U.S. is “an
energy-rich nation." but that
federal regulations ltavcprevcnted
the use of such resources as oil,
coal. and nuclear energy.

“There is more oil still there than
we have already used." Reagan
said. “I think it is the govern:
merit. . .thttt has created the energy
crisis."

v Anderson. immediately conttttcn~
ting “Mr. Reagan has ottcc again
demonstrated a totttl misunderstan-
dutg of the energy crisis which con-

fronts the nation and the world."
repeated his support for a tax on
gasoline. t

Voting Rights

continued from front page

that it gives considerable leeway for
interpretation by boards of elec—
tion.

"A county does not have to bar
students from voting." said Lester.
“Students in New York City, for
example. have been allowed to vote
in the community for a lottg time.
Albany County happens to have
some of the more stringent rules
concerning students."

Lester noted that Albany Mayor
Erastus Corning publicly says he
favors giving students voting rights.
Yet the Coming machine —— which
is widely believed to run county af—
fairs in practice — has apparently
made no move to change county

. policy. according to Lester.

“The last thing Corning wants if
for students to vote in Albany.“
Lester said.

Albany Cottttty Board of Elec-
tions Cltuirntan Raymond Kinlcy

said he has no personal opinion
about the issue. He said he has
never discussed the issue with
Mayor Corning.

“I regard my position as purely
administrative," said Kinley. “I
simply follow the laws set down by
the legislature.”

Kinlcy added that he was not
aware that boards of election are
givctt considerable discretion in for-
mulating policy.

said. “But it will be a hard job to

Colman noted that the Universi-

the Board of Regents to give con-
sideration to the International

What they had been digging in was
not undisturbed soil. but river
‘sludge (as evidenced by its texture
and pungent odor). and not less
than ten feet of it lay between them
and any signiﬁcant ﬁnds. This ex-
plained the jumble of artifacts that
had been turning up. An Indian
