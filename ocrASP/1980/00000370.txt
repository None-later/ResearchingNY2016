'The song Returns!

Led Zeppelin will perform in the
US. for the first time since the
group’s ill-fated 1978 concert tour.
Their last tour ended abruptly when
lead singer Robert Plant‘s son
died.

According to Zeppelin‘s
manager. Peter Grant, the group
will tour extensively in the US. dur-
ing October and November.

Cities the band will visit will be
announced some time next week.

Hidden Eyes

This one sounds a bit hard to
swallow: The Washington Slar
reports that a midwestern con-
gressman recently spent the night in
the nation's capital with a woman
other than his wife.

Now that item is certainly not
news in itself. But the unidentified
representative is said to have
awakened in the middle of the
night, gulped down a glass of water
next to the bed. and gone back to
sleep again.

    

‘~vu/"'

The Star says that on the follow—
ing morning, the woman awoke to
find that the congressman had
already departed for his office. She
also reportedly found that he had
drunk her contact lenses.

Stimulating Helios

Here's something to brighten up
any message you want to send to
others. The electronic greeting card
is on the way.

Leanin‘ Tree Greeting Card

'

Company of Boulder. Colorado.
says it is working on a card that will
combine light-emitting diodes, a
wafervthin battery and a paper
switch.

Doug Carlson of Leanin' Tree
says it will be a while before the
electronic card makes it debut,
however. For example, Leanin'
Tree must develop greeting card
paper capable of holding the thin
battery before the card can be test-
marketed.

Hoffman Out

Abbie Hoffman has surfaced and
remains ottt of jail. but some of his
friends may not be so fortunate.

Tlte local prosecutor in Fineview,

Thousand islands — the town
where Hoffman lived under an
assumed name -- has raised the

possibility of filing charges against
some of the people who knowingly
harbored the fugitive.

Lee Clary is the District Attorney
in Jefferson County; and he says
that anyone who knew that Hoff-
man was a bail jumper and who
failed to turn Hoffman in to
authorities could face up to a year

in jail.
Several members of the “Save
The River Committee" —- the

group organized by Hoffman while
be operated under the name “Barry
Freed" — have said publicly that
they had known that “Barry
Freed" was Hoffman for tnore than
a year.

Clary says. however, that no
criminal investigation has been in-
itiated yet; arid he admits that — in

 

 

Albany Student Press

his words —- “There's an over-
whelming burden of proof on the
prosecution" to prove harboring-a-
fugitive charges.

Dream On

Having too few hours of sleep
during the night may inhibit your
creativity.

22112..-

 

Robert Hicks. a San Jose State
University psychologist, says that
people who thittk sleep is a waste of
time may be selling themselves short
both in sleeping hours and the abili-
ty to think creatively.

Hicks says that experiments with
animals have found that those
deprived of having enough sleep
became fearless and agressivc and
took chances they normally
wouldn't take.

The psychologist says that
similarly. when people don‘t get
enough sleep they become more and
more agitated, lose their desire to
sleep. and think less creatively. even
though they may think they're do-
ing great.

Hicks says tltat not getting
enough sleep seems to produce rigid
thinking and agitation in people.

AG NEWS

Metal Bounces flack

The hard rock of the ‘60’s and
early ‘70’s may be making a com-
eback.

Cash box magazine reports that
the success of such bands as Molly
Hatchet. Henry Paul Band, the
Johnny Van Zant Band. the Ross-
ington Collins Band and Black Foot
are evidence that rock and roll is
seeing a trend back to earlier days.

Cash box quotes Black Foot
leader Ricky Medlocke as explain-
ing. “the beer drinkers and Hell
raisers are back. People are show-
ing their pride again like they did
when the Allmans and Marshall
Tucker happened in the early 70's.
“There's a little red-neck in
everybody." added Medlocke, “it’s

just showing itself a little more
these days."
Zap Attack

Would-be rapists might think
twice about attacking a woman if
they knew they would be “tapped”
immediately by a powerful electrical
shock.

Well. a team of scientists at the
Mass. Institute of Technology has
invented an anti<rape device. called
tltc “Zapper.” that will do just
that.

How does it work'.’ The device is
worn like a watch and contains two
battery-powered electrodes. Upon
contact with an attacker. the elec~
trotlcs rcpt rtedly activate an elec-
trical cuvrcnt which generates
enough \oltagc to break down a

Crappy Gap

Women have to work nearly nine
days to gross the same amount of
money men gross in just ﬁve days.

That’s according to a report
published by the Women's Bureau
of the Labor Department titled
“The Earning Gap Between
Wotncn and Men."

The report indicates that in 1977.
Inert earned an average annual
salary of $14,626 while women
earned an average yearly income of
$8.6M in similar full-time jobs. The
reports says that the difference in
male and female salaries has re-
mained virtually unchanged since
19M.

Status Meat

A Brooklyn psychiatrist. Dr. Leo
Wollman, reports he has just com«
pleted a study on the personality
differences between people who eat
hot dogs and those who prefer ham-
burgers.

 

Wollman’s study. commissioned
by a fast-food chain, reportedly
concludes that hot dog eaters tend
to be extroverts. They are described
as being convivial, aggressive and
Ioudanouthed.

Hamburger eaters, on the other
hand. are found to be introverts —
described as being conservative and
a bit on the “whimpy” side.

Asked why he did the study,
Wollmatt told US Magazine:
“What the Hell — somebody‘s got
to do these things."
