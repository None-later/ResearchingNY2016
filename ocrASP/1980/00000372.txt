I . The idea came fresh to us around 2 AM. Sunday night, hours after the

I Reagan-Anderson debate had ended.

I Just where are the minds of a new breed of college students in relation to the
national political scenario? We wondered, just how many watched the

Will not Vote

5% all

Weeks ago. we would not have dared to believe that 95% of eligible students
would actually vote in November. However, taking into account the expan-
ding number of students who have been registering as of late (with NYPIRG.

I SASU, SU, SA), it could be that many of them are telling the truth here.

Most of the eligible students who will refuse to vote do so because of a lack

of candidates “worthy” of their support, time and vote.

We expected this one. Anderson. whose appeal is largely directed toward
I young America, captured almost halfthe student vote. And not too far behind

was “u tdecided".

Most of the candidates cited under the “Other” column were Barry Com-
lmoner (Citizen's). Ted Kennedy (Democrat). and Ed Clark (Libertarian),

Almost 3/4 of Carter Supporters missed the debate completely —— probably
due to the absence of their candidate. A majority of suporters for the other
candidates stayed around to watch -— yet many of those who were undecided
in their support tended to keep away from the debate.

‘Another question of ours on the survey was: who do you lean toward after
the debate? We wanted to ﬁnd out if the debate itself would be enough to
change people's suppport from one candidate to another. However. most
students did not seem to be swayed in any immense way. Most of there original

convictions were upheld.

There were a few interesting cases though.

After the debate:

One third of those "undecided" had leaned toward Anderson after (in:
debate. One quarter of Carter supporters were leaning toward “undecided”.
also close to a fifth of Carter’s & Reagan supporters leaned toward Andcr son

after the debate.

So, if there was any slight winner irt this category, it would clearly be Alltit'l
son. (Not one Attderson supporter joined Reagan after the debate.) it seemed
to be a tie between Anderson and undecided in this question. While a tltttjoril‘.
of the senator‘s supporters felt he had irtdccd won, a majority of Reagan sup-
porters were rtot too strre about their candidate.

 

Analysis: First Presidential Debate

 

Kathleen E. Kendall
Dept. of Rhetoric and Communication

---—W

The debate between Congressman .lohrt
Anderson and Governor Ronald Reagan on
Sunday night was one of the roost signiﬁ-

lcant political events of tire last decade.
lWhy'l Because an independent candidate.
Mr. Anderson, established his legitimacy as
a ntajor candidate. Artd he did it with
words. not with money. not with a national
' party backing him. and rtot with en-
dorsentcnts of influential political figures.
I He did it by speaking to an estimated 50
Imillion people who tuned iii to watch lltc
debate. i don't mean to imply that Antlcr~
son was unknown. He came to notice as one
of seven candidates in the Republican
I primaries and caucuses. and he has travell-
ed around the country collecting two
million signatures to get on tltc ballots itt
fifty states. Nevertheless. he was running a
distinct third before the debate. and irt no
I sense was he considered an "equal" irt the
strength of his candidacy to Carter or
I Reagan. The debate changed that. Now ltc
is a ﬁgure to be reckoned with, rtot just a
I "spoiler." He is the first "alternative cau~
didatc" since Theodore Roosevelt irt l912
I to seriously threaten the two major party
contenders.

The criteria for judging a collegiate
debate, developed by the American Foren-
sic Society, emphasize the substance rather

I than the style of a debate. Judges compare
lthc debaters' use of analysis, reasoning.
I evidence. organization. and refutation. as
well as their presentation. On the basis of
I these criteria, 1 judged Anderson to be the
winner. giving ltirrt 24 points (out ofa possi-
ble 30). and Reagan 20 points. Anderson's
particular strength was ill his use of
evidence, especially in the second half of

In m  , —r ~ -,.-

Anderson Has New

tile debate. For example, Anderson showed
a dclailcd grasp of the deﬁciencies in pre-
sent military personnel (6 ottl of 10 divi-
sions cannot pass tltc readiness test, we
have a shortage of 25,000 chief petty of»
Iiccrs). artd ltc contradicted Reagan's claim
of spending cuts irt California by showing
that spending irt California rose faster than
that of the Federal government. He also
surpassed Reagan irt his analysis, address-
irtg the questions directl) and consistently.
wltilc Reagart used the questions mainly as
springboards to discuss what he wanted to
discuss. For cxatnplc. when risked how his
programs would impact on rltc ccottotrty.
Reagan sci/ed the opportunity to discuss his
record as (inventor of (‘alifornia. making
little direct reply to the question.

 

While 1 like the focus of the above
criteria on a dcbatc‘s contcrtt. the criteria
are somewhat artificial when applied to this
kind of real political contest. We know that
voters are interested in the president as a
human being. Both candidates came across
as authoritative. decisive. sincere people irt
the debate. But Reagan probably surpassed
Anderson irt his general likability. lic \Hts
friendly. informal (calling Anderson
"John"). and a good sport. saying that he
thought it was only fair that Anderson in:

\

allowed to debate. He was better than
Anderson irt talking to people irt their liv-
irtgrooms, sccrttirtg relaxed and affable. like
someone you would like to know. Ander-
son. too, had an effective manner.
vigorous, earnest. concerned-sonrtdirtg. But
his style was a bit more suitable for speak»
ing to large crowds. as he did at SUNYA.
than for television.

There are many tnorc thirth to be said ‘

about tltc debate. it wasn't really a debate.
for example. since there was no stated pro-
position. and the two men ttcver addressed
each other directly. Its bigest similarity to a
real '(icbtttc was that we saw two speakers,
rtot just one. and the two speakers clashed
on some issues. That makes thcsc

“interview debates" worthwhile. Au~
dtcrtccs not only see the candidate of their
chotce. but the other candidate, too, and
thus their knowledge of different positions
broadens. And it is more interesting to
watch a debate than a single speaker; cort-
tltct makes it better "show" than agree»
merit, and thus attracts a rttuclt lar'gcr‘zm~
drcnce.
