it was for this question that we included ‘first and second half‘ viewers.

When the affair was over. a large portion ol debate experts in Washington
were quick to award Reagan with a strong first half and Anderson with a
powerful concluding half. In this case, we went on the hypothesis that those
viewing these ‘certain halvcs’ only might tend to perceive the winner as the
‘strongest' one at the time. We did find a slight correlation — most students
Who only watched the first half believed Reagan had won — those vicwingjust
the second would tend toward Anderson. But the figures cart be misleading
since we are dealing with such a slight number of viewers in this instance of

Keep in mind that “unchanged” is relative to each personal impression. It
could mean anything from “still dislike" to “still support," depending on the

One interesting finding here is that a third of all Reagan supporters had
more positive impressions of Anderson after the dcbztlc, with not even one
supporter expressing negative feelings.

This group which represents 33% of the voting student body is probably the I
most important one to examine deeply. It seemed that many leaned toward
Mr. Anderson after the debate — and many had negative feelings toward the I
President.

Reagan and Anderson supporters were as clear as water in this question. A
majority of Carter people were also not very satisfied with their candidate’s,
decision not to appear.

While most groups found the debate somewhat informative — this is about I
all they agree on.

One third of both Reagan and Carter supporters found the debate un- I
necessary. Anderson supporters, on the other hand, found the debate very
necessary. One quarter of Carter’s supporters who viewed the debate were I
bored. They summed up the event like the supporters of the "Others"; that
