Though both attacked Carter‘s
ban policy, the two candidates
agreed on the funding of city

including the creation of an urban
investment trust fund. to be funded
by federal excise taxes on alcohol
and tobacco. Anderson said he also
saw youth employment as a high
priority, rind suggested the alloca-
tion of $1 billion to provide jobs in
energy and conservation.

The candidates were asked finally
if “a president should be guided by
organized religion on issues like
abortion, equal rights. and defense
spending."

Consistent with his tnili-ttbortion
rights and ERA platform, Rcugan
said he "has felt for it long time that
our churches have hccrl too icluc-
tant to speak up in licliziil' of" what
they think is proper in government

in his closing words. Reagan
spoke of the U.S. as "a land placed
by a divine force to bL‘ found by a
special kind of people. . .callcd an
American," and vowed that the
U.S. could regain its greatness.

Anderson, on a less prophetic

ween himself and Reagaii,_tlicn at-
tuckcd the two traditional parties as
“in their lust for the presiden-

cy. . .not looking beyond

Anderson said that the dif-

tion that he was a legitimate tiller-

A panel comprised of seven
