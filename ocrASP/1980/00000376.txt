The Albany State baseball team.
coming off their loss to Siena Col-
lege. were impressive in splitting a
doubleheader with North Adams
College on Saturday. The Danes
won the ﬁrst game by a score of 8-4.
but dropped the night-cap, 8-6. 1n
the opener. the Danes received an
outstanding performance from pit-
cher Mike Esposiio. Esposito pitch-
ed six complete innings. yielding all
four ol‘Sicna's runs. Esposiio’s per-
formance raised his record to 2-0,
and lowered his E.R.A. to 2.00.

Esposito survived until the
seventh inning. when reliever Ken
Campbell came in with runners on
first and second base, got the first
two hiltcrs to pop out. and walked a
batter to load the bases. But.
Campbell came through by striking
out the ﬁnal batter to record the
save.

"11 feli really good to come in
and help contribute to the win.
Nonh A dams had some very tough
hitters in their lineup, bur our team
defense held them when it

- counted,” said Cambell.

' The Dane offense was explosive
in the ﬁrst game. Freshman Greg
Marcione doubled in the tying run
in the fourth inning. Later on in the
fourth. Jerry Rosen tripled in the
winning runs.

Despite a comeback attempt, the
Danes lost the second game by a
score of 8-6. Albany pitcher Tlm
Vaughn was knocked around in the
early innings. He left after the ﬁfth
ining. trailing by a score of 6-1.
Dave Van Osten and Ron Massione
came on to pitch steadily in relief.
However. the Albany's late inning
rally fell short.

Albany head coach Rick Skccl
was satisﬁed with his club’s perfor-
mance. "North Adams has a very
competitive ball club. After this
double header split, our players
might be beginning to realize their
caliber. We have a very tough up-
coming week," said Skecl. “We
play Oneonta on Wednesday and
then Potsdam and Ramapo next
weekend. This week will be a good
test for our club."
