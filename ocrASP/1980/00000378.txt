but there was a promising perfor-
mance: Scott James, the Danes‘ top
cross country riiari, triumphed over
the large field. Also. junior Todd
Silva. a veteran distance runner. im-
proved his time by 30 seconds front
a year earlier.

Munsey has been slightly
distraugltt over the team's start.
“l'm used to winning - it's very
tough to lose. in the previous 17
y ars we compiled a dual meet
record of i60—45. a .780 winning
percentage.” points out the Danes'
coach.

Munsey is searching for the light
at the end of the tunnel: “The early
meets are not as important (as the
later ones). The ﬁnal scheduled
events are of more consequence,
and we have closed out with strong
performances in the second half of
the season before."
~ The Danes hit the road again this
Saturday for Williams.
Massachusetts. where they will
compete against Williams College
and the University of Vermont. The
Harriers have a 3-4 series record
with Williams College and have
never lost to the University of Ver~

.“The competition is much easier
than the preceding two weeks and i
hope we will be able to pull an upset

ponents.” concluded Munsey.

September 23, 1980

by Larry Kahn

A wee bit of the irish came to
Albany yesterday when the Albany
State men’s soccer team clashed
with Queens of lreland in an exhibi-
tion match. Queens trampled the
Dane hooters. 4—1. in a game they
totally dominated.

"They're a very good team. the
equivalent of some of the better
teams here. but they're not over-
powering," said Albany soccer
coach Bill Schieffelin. "We're just
not playing the kind of soccer we're
capable of playing."

Queens spent the greater part of
the first half in Dane territory ap-
plying constant pressure on
goalkeeper Alberto Giordano who
made save after save all afternoon.
The lrishmen slipped their first goal
in with only about tcti minutes
gone. One of their forwards broke
free in the middle and pushed it past
Giordano.

The visitors had many oppor-
tunities but only struck once more
before the iialf ended. They
brought the ball tip on the outside
and a perfect pass set the ball up
right in front of the goal — Gior-
dano didn’t liaVc a chance.

“Our defensive ttiarkirtg was not
good — we gave them much too
much space.” said Schieffelin. “We
were also making passes without rr
purpose. l'm very dissatisﬁed with
our play." he continued.

hustling. Within two iniriirtcs.

with the keeper, but came tip empty
when the defender made a diving
save. After a few more near misses.
freshman Luis Morales took a pass
in the middle and snuck a bouncer
into the riet for Albany's first goal.
Morales barely missed the tying
goal before Queens put it otrt of
reach with two quick scores.

“We’re playing terribly. We're in
a real rut." said Schieffliri. "Our
reserves hustled out that goal. ()ur'
starters were going through the rim-
tiotis. btit were not playing soccer.
There are going to be some shake-
ups against Sicnrr."

bribly won't go unchallenged in the

"W 'rc oric-riiid-one in oitr cori-

Albaiiy got off to a slow start in
the garric. but managed to hold
Oneoiita at bay for most ofthe first
half. “We just couldn't get uri-
tracked." Schieffelin noted. “For
the first fifteen itiinutes we looked a
little nervous out there. but then we
settled down and played a fine
game."

The first half was very even — it
wasn‘t ttutil l:45 left that Otieontti
pushed their first goal across. Ari
()ticonto forward took a hard shot
that Giordano knocked away. but
the rebound carrorned off Albany
halfback Luis Araiigo and the ball
hit the corner pole — it bounced in.
“They got a ltrcky break and
capitrilircd on it." said Schieffelin.

He added, “We had two or three
opportunities where we had it player
one—ori-oiic with the keeper. Jeff
Marin lirid a few shots. but we just
couldn't cash them in."

in the second half. Oncorita’s
task was to protect their slim lead.
According to Scliieffelin, they did
this by toning down the price of the
game to minimize Albany's physical
advantage. "()ricoiita slowed the
grime down after they scored." he
said. “That hurt us — we played to

some opportutiitics — we were too
careful."

Another reason was the failure of
forward Afrim Nezai to score.
Nezaj has all three regular season
goals for Albany this year. “Afrini
didn't play well." Schieffelin
noted. "When he has a bad game.
the whole tcarri suffers. The team
depends on him too much."

With the punch missing front the
Albany attack. ()rieouta’s second
goal was just icing on the cake.
With about eight minutes left in the
game. Oneotttrt chipped a free shot
and Giordano was it little late iti
covering it and it got by him for a
score.

The two goals were the first Gior~
daiio has given tip this year. but
despite that. Scliiei‘feliti felt he
played a good game with twelve
saves. “Albert played an outstati-
ding gum ‘ and John Markes played
well on defense. Otherwise. nobody
else played an outstanding game.
The guys played hard. btrt didn't
work well together," commented
Scliicffeiin.
