mission had been obtained to dig on
the private property involved. One
of the problems archaeologists
often encounter initially is receiving
permission to begin digging. it had
taken three weeks in this particular
case.

ride to the second site over a dirt
road~which had more holes than
dirt—was strongly reminiscent of

carrying all their equipment.

Once there. "Our basic strategy
was to open up spatially separated
units in order to get an idea of how
the site changed within its boun-
daries." Bender explained. “in ad-
dition to that. we had one person
(one of the three teaching assistants
that were also on the dig) go out
with a shovel and sink ortc mctcr
pits in certain areas to ascertain thc
extent of some of the more ill-
tcrcsting features we uncovered.
The reason for the sampling was
that we were finding cultural
material in areas we had not ex-
pected to. and we wanted to find
out if that material was an isolated

find or a large cultural occurrence.
We spread out our pits to get a good
idea of what was going on at the
site. We wanted to try to establish
the time of year the site was oc-
cupied. as well as what it was used
for.

“Three adjacent pits were ex-
cavated in one area of the site.
Here. we exposed an extensive oc-
cupatioanl floor showing evidence
of an aboriginal living space.
Prehistoric ceramics. including an
entire pot bottom. seeds. bone. and
charcoal were uncovered. as well as
fire-rcddencd earth and intrusive
plow furrows, recognizable by dif-
ferent colored bars of soil.

“At another pit area, which we
called ‘fcaturc north’. we found a
prehistoric garbage dump. known
as a ‘midden‘. with scattered stone
tools and flakes (lithics) and
ceramics nearby.

“in the third excavated area of
the site. we found a large feature. a
pit filled with blackened earth.
which I don’t know how to inter-
pret yet. and scattered associated
artifacts. including several ar-
rowheads. probably dating back to
4000—1500 B.C."

"What we're basically doing is
trying to push back through time.
We have, at Troy 5. a fairly con-
tinuous occupation time of
somewhere between six to eight
thousand years. Over this time

curred in how people use the land.

Tucker Concert Fails

Al Stewart concert a couple of years
back. “At this point. we're really
starting to get discouraged." he
said.

“We'll just have to hire lcsscr
name bands and sell tickets at lower
prices." Montanaro said.

UCB sold approximately 1350
pre-conccrt tickets. and sold an ad-
ditional 550 tickets on the day of
the concert. estimated Montanaro.
A sell—out crowd would have been
2900. he said.

The total cost for the production
of the Marshall Tucker concert was
close to $29,000. of that, $16,500
went to the Marshall Tucker Band
and their managers.

When asked how he felt about
the financial loss. SA Controller ira
Somach stated. “there were

technical difficulties beyond our
supervision."

Commenting on why he felt the
concert lost money. Somach said
simply, “people didn't respond."

UCB has two concerts tentatively
scheduled for the near future. On
October 17. UCB will present Blot-
to in the Campus Center Ballroom
and on November 21. Rockpiie will
appear featuring Dave Edmunds
and Nick Lowe.

Montanaro said tickets for
Rockpilc will be lower in price titan
those for Marshall Tucker.

Montnnaro concluded by saying,
“You pay nine dollars in the col-
iscum to sit up in the rafters . . . .
We just hope for good attendance
at future concerts so we can have
more good concerts.”
