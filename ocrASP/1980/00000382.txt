Coke Adds...

Coke sales. coca-cola that is. may
go up in Cleveland when rock music
fans hear about this.

C.B.S. records and the Cleveland
Coca-Cola Bottling Company, in
conjunction with radio station
W.M.M.S.. are now offering
special lines of tab. sprite. and coke
with bottiecaps carrying the pic—
turcs of some of C.B.S.'s biggest
rtarrrcs recordirtg artists.

Tire so-called "superstar caps"
feature the likes of Billy Joel. Pink
Floyd. Paul McCartney. Michael
Jackson and .lourney. 'llrcy cntitlc
soft drinkers to a 40 percent dis~
count on (213.5. tapes and records
by a Superstar artist at local record
shops.

Feline Backing

Ronald Reagan has received
another official endorsement for
the presidency.

  

Former black panther leader
Eldridge Cleaver. once a Carter
supporter. says he has turned
thumbs down on the President and
now wants to see Reagan elected in
November.

Cleaver. the inventor of
“cleavers” — pants which provide
an extra pocket for a man’s crotch
—— and the proponent of rcgulrtr
wife beatings, says he has thrown
his support to Reagan because
(‘artcr has become the
"laughingstock of the international
Community," and hasn’t lived up
to expectations.

Rape Rap

A woman's background may be a
key to avoiding rape.

That's according to University
of iilinois Professor of Psychiatry
arid Sociology. Pauline Bart.

liatt studied 94 women. SI of
whom were attacked hut avoided
being raped and 43 of whom were
raped. Bart says she found tltat
women who avoid all attempted
rape are generally more irrdcpen»
dent. She says~in her
words—"They are usually first-
hortr daughters and their parents
did not intervene if they got into
fights with other children."

liart also says that women who
ltave “feminist” traits are more
likely to avoid rape.

iiart's study also found that tirosc
women who were raped tried only
one strategy, that of pleading. while
those avoiding rape tried scream-
ing. fleeing and the rise of physical
force.

Bart says women who get regular
physical exercise or particiate in
sports are more likely to avoid rape.

Big Bucks In Butts

Here’s good news for smokers:
cigarettes aren't likely to be banned
in the near future.

The San Francisco Chronicle
reports that the tobacco industry is
such a large contributor to the U.S.
economy that if it were suddenly
stopped, 450.000 people in jobs
directly related to growing and pro-
cessing tobacco would be otrt of
work.

 

Albany Student Press

 

 

  

G .

On top of that, The Chronicle
says. almost 2 million jobs would be
lost that are indirectly dependent on
the industry.

 

According to the newspaper, a re-
cent study by the Wharton School
of Business found that, directly or
indirectly. 201,300 jobs in Califor-
nia are related to the tobacco in-
dustry while 159.200 jobs in New
York, and 47,700 jobs in North
Carolina. the heartland of tobacco.
are dependent on the leafy crop.

Monkey Business

There‘s been some unusual
"monkeying around" on a
Wcliman. Mississippi, farm lately.
That’s because a four-and-a-half
foot, 92-pound chimpanzee
reportedly has been working there
as a farrnhand.

Cedo the chimp lives with farmer
Linsber Bristcr, who says of his
furry friend: “it takes him a little
longer to figrrrc things out. But he
cart get the job done."

Brister bought (‘edo for about
$5(X) from a man who brought the
chimp to Mississippi front Africa.
Under Bristcr's supervision. Cedo
allegedly plows with a tractor. cuts

the lawn with a mower. builds
fences. and feeds cattle.

if you think this is hard to
believe. there's more: Brister says
he and the chimp occasionally go
ﬁshing together. with Ccdo baiting
his own hook; and the chimp
reportedly drinks beer and smokes
an occasional cigarette and uses a
krtife and fork.

Women On Call

An organization called “Women
U.S.A.“ has launched a national
toil—free political ltotline which pro-
vides information on subjects of na-
tional interest to women.

The hotlinc reportedly offers a
new recording every week concern-
ing topics of special interest to
women. Women U.S.A. also invites
other groups to submit messages on
national women‘s issues.

Currently. former Congress
member Bella Abzug is using the
lrotline to urge people to support
Senate Bill 1843. a piece of legisla-
tion which authorizes help for bat-
tered wives.

if you'd like to find out what’s
happening on the “Women
U.S.A." hotiine. just dial (800)

Three Mile Strike

Citizens in south central Perin-
sylvania are organizing a blockade
to keep the Three Mile island
nuclear power plant sltut down
should the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission decide to start up
Three Mile island again.

The 'Nuciea: Regulatory Com-
mission in scheduled to hold healing
in October on the fate of the crippl-
ed nuke piant, and could give the
go-ahead for the restarting of Three
Mile island’s undamaged unit one
reactor.

However. members of the March
28 coalition report they are already
organizing a blockade of the
nuclear facility if the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission decides in
favor of Metropolitan Edison put-
ting Three Mile island back on line.

The Coalition says it is already
organizing transportation, housing
and training sessions in direct non-
violent action for the expected
demonstrators.

Says an official statement by the
coalition. “we will not tolerate the
same mistake being made twice.”

Hip Listings

California's Marin County has a
reputation for being the center of
hip and trendy lifestyles in the
golden state. and the new phone
book for that county furthers that
reputation.

 

The Marin County Yellow Page:
include ﬁve pages of listings for hot
tubs in which 56 different hot tub
firms are listed. in contrast. the CL
ty of Chicago Yellow Pages have.
less than one column of listings for
hot tubs.
