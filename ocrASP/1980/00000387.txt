editorial .

Last Friday it was ﬁrst reported that one of tlic nation's most powerful incontinental
missiles in Arkansas was destroyed. it cxpiodcd “Iikc Roman candies", blasting a heavy
concrete door and leaving a cratcr 200 feet wide. The shcli of thc rocket was "charrcd" and
many news sources claimed that the nuclear warhead it held had been blown right out of the
missile silo. The military refused to confirm this, yet procccdcd to block off the area while
they searched throughout pastures for tire wtir‘licttd.

We blew it tip all by ourselves without any assistance from the ‘cricrny'. Ah, we imagine
could tlic enemy bc frorri within?

Today is a new Friday and most of tlic ilL‘\\'\ t't)‘.‘(:iiti;c oftiic ‘niisxilc riiixhttp' has withcrcd
away; attention is now focusing on the tipmrniny election and thc L'i'l‘d» in Iran.

 
   

Mark: "One of the problems with getting back inside the silo is we don ‘t knowall theftlel‘
has exploded. "

Thc evacuees were allowed to return to their homes and according to Carter, "everything
is safe.” (After all, had they kept all those people away from the site for too long. the pro-
blem may have been perceived as more than routine. Radiation leakage or not, good think-
ing guys.)

Steve Taylor, a reporter for the Arkansas Democrat, was present at the scene of the explo-
sion. He said debris from the blast fell up to a quarter of a mile away, and that he thought it
was the end of the world.

“Everything is safe": President Jimmy Carter, just thousands of miles from the scene.

The explosion prompted demand for a congressional inquiry to determine whether the
missiles are worth keeping.

Ofcoursc they're worth keeping. Only one human unit has lost his life, a handful scarred.
and a few tiny communities frightened. After all, how else can we hope to threaten other na-
tions with devastating their populations?

"If they‘re not safe and effective I don‘t know why you need it, ” whinipers Senator
Robert Dole, whose honiestrlte of K armor is one of the states housing the Ittiss‘iles.
Don't be such a wimp, Bob. They are safe. Government and Pentagon experts will
ttssurc" us of this. Arid we know they’re effective. That's wiry Russia has them too. and
