Albany Student Press

by Dan Wallach

To be perfectly honest. the
Albany Statcwomen’svarsity tennis
team can sometimes bore you to
death. Such was the case on
Wednesday afternoon when
Onconta State (0-2) ventured to
Albany to face the Danes. In a
rather uneventful. boring match.
the Danes overpowered a helpless
Oneonta squad. 7-0. upping their
match record to 2-0.

They were never really challenged
at all. as the Danes won most of the
sets by scores of 6-0. This was a
complete change from their match
last week against Binghamton,
which was a struggle from start to
finish.

The ruost impressive perfor-
mance of the afternoon belonged to
sophomore Nancy Light. the
number one singles player. After a
hardl'ought victory last week (in
which head coach Peggy Mann call-
ed her performance suhpnr) she

'llnnlly gained the top fornt which

she was looking for. Playing much
more ttgressively than site did
against Ilinghttmton. Nancy
destroyed ()ueonta‘s Lydia Spicsre.
(t-t). (l-O. Nancy was never challeng-
ed in this one. making it look easy.
She dominated Spicser with an
overpowering two-handed
backhand. in addition to her play
up at the net.

It! the number two spot. Albany

 

freshman Cari Solomon had just as
little trouble In disposing of her op-
ponent, Oneonta’s Maggie
Richards. The score was similar;
6-0. 6-1. Solomon used her over-
powering serve to handcuff
Richards. On most of her serves.
the Onconta player committed what
is known as a footfault, which
means she was inside the court
before her racket connected with
the ball.

Another freshman, Lauren
Issacs, moved up to the third singles
spot after losing in doubles with
Pant Duchin last week. Issacs came
up against Onconta's Sheila
Rooney. and won. 6-0. 6-2. Strange
as it may scent. this was the most
eventful match of the afternoon.
There were many long and exciting
rallies between the two players. with
Issaes winning most of them. She
kept Rooney at bay with a strong
return and an amazingly effective
drop shot. which Rooney had great
difficulty contending with. issues.
playing in only her second collegiate
match (both victorious). showed a
tremendous amount of poise. There
was a time in the second set when
she almost lost her cool after losing
two straight games. but she manag-
ed to maintain her composure.
Mann explained that. “by getting
on herself. she gets loosened up and
as a result. plays better."

In other matches. Elise Solomon
(sister of Cari) had a little. bit of dif-
ﬁculty, but put down a rally by
Oneonta’s Debbie Schwartz to win,
6-I. 7-5.

In the fifth singles match. Sandra
Borellc had an easy time defeating
Donna Besser of Onconta. 6-1. 6-0.

Albany's two doubles combina-
tions had much better luck with
Onconta than they did with
Binghamton. After being destroyed
by the Colonels last week. Albany’s
doubles combos had a smooth time
of it.

The number one doubles team of
Sue Bard and Joan Phillips
defeated Mary Ellen Smith and Liz
Chestia. 6-0. 6-3. Albany's number
two tandem of Chris Rodgers and
Nancy Levine did not have much of
a challenge from Oneonta’s Lori
Friedman and Lori Sorcnson,
defeating them 6-0, 6-1.

After trying out a few doubles
combinations, Mann seems to have
found the right combos who feel
comfortable with. and confident of
each othcr's abilities.

The women nctters travel to St.
Lawrence to face. perhaps. their
toughest competition of the year. In
last year’s matchup between the
two. St. Lawrence (7-0) emerged
victorious. Albany then goes to
Potsdam to complete the weekend
trip.

challenge matches are a good idea.
“They can hurt a team's moral." he
said. Starting Friday. Lewis and his
Danes face a greater challenge —-

tltc fourth annual Great Dane
Classic.
The tournament. which was

started four years ago to include
some of the local Division II and III
teams. has grown to include sixteen
teams. from all three divisions,
from as far away as Maryland.

Last year. Concordia and Iona
tied for first. Lehigh took third.
Clark. fourth, Rochester. fifth and
Williams. sixth. In individual play
Concordia's Ailtor Borges and
Jacob Krcimer. both form Brazil,
took first and second repcctivcly.
This year Lewis feels that except for
Lehigh, “who should be no factor
this year,“ all of last year‘s winners
have a shot to win this year. Lewis
feels that Rochester stands a par-
ticularly good chance to win.

As for the Dane’s own chances,
Lewis thinks. “we have a good
chalice to place in the top six this
year."

Play gets underway Friday morn-
ing and continues all day Saturday.

Booters Win

linbly one of the best in New York
State." he continued.

Albany plays a ball control game
which differs greatly from the style
of the remaining teams in their con-
fcrcncc. Squads such as Cortland
and Sicna play a more aggressive,
hardnoscd rough game.

Tomorrow Albany will take on
Cortland at Blecker Stadium, at
I100. Sehieffelin expects a “good,
hard game" which he thinks his
team can win. This contest will be
followed by another home game
versus Hartwick. “Hartwick is an
excellent team and will probably be
our toughest opponent in our next
four games." added the coach. The
Danes will then travel to Brockport
and Union for matches against
these two rivals.

“If we can win three of our next
four games we will be in good posi-
tion. I think our team is up to the
test," ' “ ‘ Schicffelin.
