. Hard Luck Balm

by Marc Haspel

Luck is one intangible that
coaches rarely boast about but
almost always want to have. As
Albany baseball coach Rick Skeel
watched Dane Bobby Arcario’s
potential three run blast bounce off
the top of the fence and back into
fairplay, he knew luck wasn't on his
side.

He knew luck wasn't on his side
because a homer would have put
Albany ahead of Oneonta in the last
inning of play in the ﬁrst game of
their twin bill Wednesday afternoon
at Oneonta. The Danes eventually
dropped the opener, 9-8. but aveng-
ed the loss by taking the night cap,
6-3. to gain a split on the day.

in the opener. Albany jumped
out to an early 50 lead with three
runs in the ﬁrst inning. including a
solo homerun by Bob Tortorello.
The Danes got another two more in
the second.

Dane starter Jim Bittker did not
have very good control, allowing
the Red Dragons to tie up the score
at 5-5. mainly on walks. Skeel, feel-
ing that “Bittker's arm wasn‘t
healthy," brought on Ken Camp-
bell in relief in the fourth inti-
ing.“Campbell did real well. l-ic's
doing a nice job for us." said Skeel.

I Albany took the lead again. 7-5.
in the ﬁfth frame but saw that ad-
vantage quickly removed as Oneon-
ta came back with two runs to tie in
the bottom half of the inning.

But, in the sixth, Oneonta look
their first lead of the day on
ﬁrstbaseman Tom Lorenzo's dou-
ble with runners on second and
third. which broke it open 9-8.

As far as the Danes were concern-
ed, Oneonta’s Lorenzo was
"unstoppable." He had eight hits
and seven ribbies during the
doubleheader.

in the fateful seventh and final
inning, Albany scored only once,
and were denied on Arcario’s
almost homerun. “Bad luck is
frustrating. Bobby's ball was sailing
otrt but didn't go," said Skeel.

The Dunes took the second game
by a score of 6-3. The story of that
game was Albany pitcher Mike
Esposito. He went the entire way
and now is undefeated in three per-
formttnces.

it was Oneonta this time that
jumped out to an early 2-0 lead,
with Lorenzo once again providing
the firepower. Albany chipped til
the lead with one rttn irt the second.

day and a 4-2 Dane lead.

Oneonta scored one more time to
cut Albany’s lead to one. With run-

ners on ﬁrst and second, Dane cat-

cher Bob Brunner doubled. sealing

the Dane win at 6-3.

The win was the Dane's ﬁrst in
Oneonta in over a decade. “Last
year we would have been happy just
to beat Oneonta. Anytime we really
beat them, it's good,” said Skeel.

As for the element of luck, the
Danes would surely like some of it
to be good for a change. in their
four losses, three of which have
been one-run ball games, Skeel
believes that the Danes have not
had that good fortune — especially
when he considers the ball that took
a bad hop over the head of second-
baseman Tortorello at Utica and
now Arcario's near homerun.

“Lady luck, 1 never believed in
her before, but now i know you
need her sometimes to grace your
bats,"said Skeel.

The Danes continue their busy
week with a conference
doubleheader here at Albany
tomorrow against Potsdam (1:00
p.m.) and another one Sunday.
away at Ramapo College in New
Jersey.

news -— the Albany State women's
volleyball team lost their first two
matches without witmittg ti single
game. Now the good news -— their
toughest matches of tire year are

spikers held their own.

The Danes hit the road on
Wednesday night and were defeated

, in both ends of it dual meet against

(‘olgzttc and Nazareth til Colgate.
Colgate is one of the top Divisiott l
teams irt the state and last year,
Nit/areth was tltc top ranked Divi-

bttdly v— they're just both very good
teams," said Albany volleyball

' conch l’nt Dwyer. “They'll pro-

bubly be the two hardest matches of
the year.”

inert though Albany didn't win
any of the games, they kept the
matches close cnotrglr to make them

Levine Back in Top Spot

by Eric Gruher

The Albany State men's tennis
team continued their winning
season Tuesday as they soundly
defeated Vassar, away, 90.

Albany eoaclt Bob Lewis corn-
Plained, “Vassar was not very
good. We like to play learns of
higher caliber." thSSitr'S
weaknesses came to light as Albany
won all nine matches in straight
sets.

in the number one spot, Barry
Levine beat Vassar’s Claude Akin.
64. 64).

Fred Ciabcr playing number two
had no trouble with Jim Shavick
and beat him. 6~2, 64.

Freshman sensation Robert

Karen improved his personal record
to three wins, as he downed

David Lerner had an easy little of

in doubles the Danes had cort-
tinucd success, as the rtttrnber one
combination of Cuber and Levine
devastated their opponents, Akin
and l-lafl, 6-l, 6-1.

The duo of Ulrich and Karen
joined forces to trottnce Vnssttr's

Hoffman and Eric Lipson, 6-i, 6-0.

Diamond and Dave Feinermatt
closed out the Dane‘s successful day
by heating the combo of Pete Ltrgo
and Mark Gltrzcr, 7-6, 6-0.

Lewis had commented previously
that he "would not be surprised if
there were sortie changes" to be
tirade in the seed placements. These
changes did occur as Levine bent
Cuber iii a closely contested three
set challenge match for the number
one spot.

Gather and Karen still ltavc a shot
to capture the first seed. but they
must first play itt their own

losing, l5-ll. They then dropped
the second game, 15-8, and the first
game to Colgate by the same score.
In the final game, Albany jtrrttpcd
to an impressive 9-l lend before col-
lapsing, when they lost 14 straight
poirtts to finish, l5-9.

“We never got tiny trtornentttrrr
going,” said Dwyer. “All the games
were close until we stopped scoring
points. We didn‘t quite come
through in tire key moments. l think
we jtrst need to play a little more."

Dwycr doesn't expect the rcsl of
the season to be so bad. “it was it
disadvantage starting against tltc
toughest teams," he said. “But we
should make the state champion»
ships this year. We’ll probably be
ranked seventh or eighth iii the
state."

Lttst year the spikers were ranked
fourth in the state with a l4-5
record and also made the cham-
pionships. This year the scltedulc
.hould be more rigorous. “We have
'.t tougher schedule this year."

noted Dwyer. “But the more they
play the better they’ll get. in the

  

long run it should work ottt better
for us."

One of the spikcrs’ major
obstacles this year is their youth.
The only returning senior is captain
Anttc (‘ztrbcrry. and there are three
juniors. The rest of the team cort-
‘lSlti of sophomores and freshmen.
“lixpcricnccd setting is a little lack-
ing as well as experience overall,”
i)wyer remarked.

Their next volleyball match is
tomorrow against. Kings College
and Rutgers Newark, away. Last
year the Danes beat Kings, but did
not play Rutgers Newark — one of
the more powerful teams they'll
face this year. The ﬁrst home meet
will be on Wednesday against
Russell Sage, Siena, and Bingham-
ton.

With more titan 20 games left to
play, the spikcrs are by no means in
bad shape. “Overall, l'ttt pleased,"
said Dwyer. “We played well, not
as well its we could, but good
ertough for our first match." He
added, "Hopefully we’ll do better
on Saturday."
