A strong defensive performance
by John Marks and a goal and assist
added by Leslie Severe helped the
Albany’Danes defeat Siena 2-0 in a
soccer match Wednesday.

“This was an important game for
us. it was a well played contest in
which the team rid itself of any
earlier attitude problems and in-
cohesiveness," stated Dane head-
coach Bill Schieffelin.

The team received outstanding

“Marks did a tremendous, all-
American job on defense. He is not
ﬁashy, but a very steady ballplnyer
— an unsung hero," said the coach.

Goalie Giordano recorded his
third shutout in four outings. He
tallied seven saves and was only
tested once.

coach noted was smaller than most
soccer ﬁelds. “The smaller playing
area caused there to be a lot of
bodies in one spot, making it dif-
ficult to penetrate," explained
Schieffelin.

The Danes dominated the first
half and continued to control the
game into the second half. Thé
Albany booters ﬁnally broke the ice
at the 20:00 mark of the ﬁnal half.
Leslie Severe dribbled the ball
downfield into the opposing penalty
area. He drew three Siena
defenders, which left Afrim Nezaj
wide open. Severe laid Nezaj a
beautiful pass and he proceeded to
knock the ball into the goal to put
Albany on top, 1-0.

the goalie's head and closed the
scoring at 2-0.

“it was a nice goal, Leslie is a
very talented youngster and proved
it again today,” commented Schief-
felin.

in this game, the coach modiﬁed
the offense by switching Nezaj back
to halfback and moving Severe to

has scored four goals and Severe
has tallied one goal and three
assists.

The convincing victory evened
the Dane’s conference record at 1-1

3-1. “The team is very young. We
are gaining experience in each
outing,” added Schieffelin. “Our

Albany State could be in trouble.

if you go back to last year’s three
season-ending losses, and tack on
the two defeats this year, the Danes
are in the midst of a five-game los-
ing streak — the longest since varsi-
ty football began here in 1974.

“We'd like to end it pretty quick-
ly," said Albany coach Mike
Walsh.

The Danes will have that chance
tomorrow when they travel to
Brockport to face the 1-2 Golden
Eagles - a team that head coach
Bob Ford mentioned in pre-season
as one team Albany should beat.

Despite the fact that Albany has
won six games in a row over
Brockport (38-6 in 1979), the
Golden Eagles have some weapons
that could be troublesome for
Albany.

The passing game is one —
perhaps the biggest one. Quarter-
back Tim Brunelle (6-0, 205 lbs.)
threw 15 completions in 23 attempts
for 177 yards in a losing effort ver-
sus Alfred, and was named to the
ECAC Honor Roll. “He’s a strong
kid —- a good thrower," said Dane
coach Matt Diange of Brunellc, the
tenth rated passer in Division 111.
"Their passing game was the big-
gest thing against Alfred," he con-
tinued. On the season, Eagle
quarterbacks have connected on 30
of 53 attempts for 369 yards (56.6
percent, 12.9 yards per catch).
Meanwhile, the Albany sccondary'
has given up 13 receptions in 31'
tries (41.9 percent) for 245 yards
(18.9 yard average).
it’s been the long pass that’s hurt
the Danes, especially against lthaca

 

E01 yards in nine completions),

and that’s where the Eagles
specialize. Split end Roy Voliton is
their leading receiver, snaring nine
catches for an impressive 178 yards
(19.8 average). “He's a burner,"
said Diange of the fleet-footed
Voliton. A starter since his
freshman year, Voliton will be the
man who'll try to break Albany's
three-deep secondary. "When they
(Brockport) throw the ball, six out
of ten times they’re going to throw
to him. He’s a real threat," said

it will be he Job of Albany Quarterback Mike Ftorlto to end the Danes' string of mi scoreless periods.

Dane defensive coordinator Mike

Motta.
When they're not throwing,
though, Brockport's offensive

numbers are not as awe inspiring.
Running the ball out of their wing-
t, multiple-type offence, the Eagles
have netted only 248 yards on 123
rushes for an average of just over
two yards per carry. Fullback Dave
Cotter tops the list with 148 yards
on 34 carries — not impressive
ﬁgures. But the 6-0, 215-pound bull

has yet to be thrown for a loss.

Halfback Cornelius Boykins, a
big ground gainer for Brockport in
the past, has been held to 60 yards
on 26 rushes. With Reggie Cox,
Boykins is the outside runner that
the Eagles must get loose in order to
be effective. Neither haVc great size.
Cox is only 5-7, 167 lbs., and
Boykins is 5-9. 170. But the latter is
the biggest threat of the two, accor-
ding to Malta.

credibly large (average weight: 220
lbs., height: 6-2). “They're a sound
offensive line, but they don’t really
sustain their blocks," said Diange.
He also noted that they have weak
pass blocking, and he thought that
Albany would be able to exploit
that.

Anchored by co-captain
linebackers Rick Willctt and Fred
Hence, and defensive end Frank
Turbin, Brockporl's 5-2 defense
could pose a problem for Albany's
run-oriented wishbone attack.

“Their front seven are very
solid." said Albany coach Mike
Angelo of the Eagle’s five lineman
and two linebackers. “if we can
handle them, we have a good
chance of winning the ballgamc,"
he continued.

Angelo noted two match-ups in
particular that are keys to Albany's
offensive success. One is between
Dane center Mike Arcttri (6-1, 205
lbs.) and Eagle middle guard Jeff
Quartaro (6-0, 220 lbs.). “He
(Qtttrrlaro) has got good speed arid
is a good pass ruslter," said Angelo
of the noseguard. Another is het-
wccn Albany offensive tackle Jim
[isposito (6-3, 220 lbs.) and deferr-
sive tackle Mike Morrnino (6-0,
215). Angelo calls Mormino, “by
for, their best puss rusltcr."

“if we cart control those two, we
can control the line of scrimmage."
said Angelo. And he felt that such
control could sway the decision
towards the Danes. “We rnttst con- -
trol the line of scrimmage, eliminate
their pass rush. and play errorlcss
football," Angelo continued.

The Brockport secondary is,
susceptible to the pass, arid gave up1

“Pine Hills Molester” Attacks-VictimAgain

by Beth Sexer

After six weeks of calm, a man
thought to be the Pine Hills
molester has returned to victimize
Albany women.

This‘time, the attacker returned
to the home of a woman he
molested just two months ago on
July 28, according to Albany detec-
tive Lt. H. John Damino.

According to the Knickerbocker
News, the victim of the incident,
which took place at about 2 am.
yesterday morning, is a 23-year-old
woman who lives on the 500 block
of Madison Avenue.

The attacker, Damino said,
entered through an "open, unlock-
ed window in the east side
bedroom. Everything else was lock-
ed."

Damino said police cannot be
sure that the attacker is the man
known as the “Pine Hills Molestcr"
but his description “is very similar
in mold."

The Pine Hills Molester is
described as a black male, between

five feet, ﬁve inches to ﬁve feet,
nine inches tall, slim, slender in
build, but athletic.

While the Knickerbocker News
reported that this is the first case in
which the attacker has returned to
the same house. Damino said that
the attacker has done this once or
twice before.

Damino suggested that the
Molester returned to the house on
Madison Avenue because he knew it
was easy to enter, and was in-
habited by women.

in almost 95 percent of the cases
Damino said, the Molester entered
through unlocked windows. “Most
people are not security conscious,"
he said.

Albany Police have "beefed up
the number of patrols" in tire Pine
Hill area, said Damino. However,
he said, “there's just so much the
police department can do. Wc'd
like to put a policeman on every
corner."

Since reports of the Molester
were received in May 1979, police
have used undercover officers,

tracking dogs, a psychologist and a
full-time squad of detectives to
solve the case. So far, however,
they have been unsuccessful in their
search.

Damino said that the Molester is
probably an introvert, who is not
likely to brag about his crime. Also,
the Pine Hills area is large, contain-
ing between 10,000 to 15,000 peo-
ple. Damino added that the
Molester has also been “extremely
lucky."

if a woman is awakened by the
Molester Darnino suggests that she
scream to frighten him away, and
call the police immediately. She
should not try to apprehend him or
block his way. In all past occur-
rences, the attacker has been scared
away when the victim awakens and
screams.

Damino said that in the recent in-
cident the victim called police only
after site and her friends cireckcd
the house to see if the Molcstcr was
gortc. By that tirrrc, the Molcstcr
had long fled the area.

Presidential Candidate Arrives

Socialist Party Platform Aired

mainly trying to do in the campaign
is mobilize people around the anti-

With this motive, Pulley spoke to

SASU Protest Campout
Awaits City’s Approval

by Wayne I'ecreboom

A campout scheduled for 0c-
tobcr 1, on thc front lawn of the
SUNY Central buildings on Broad—
way in Albany, has been delayed
because a permit from tltc City of
Albany has yet to be obtained, ac—
cording to SASU (‘omnurnictttions
Director Pam Snook. The curri-
potrt, coordinated by SASU, had
been planned to protest the dorm
rootn rate hikes.

The campout, coined “Tent Ci-
ty" is part of a semester long cum-
pttign to protest tltc $150 rent bike
which has affected all SUNY
schools, explained Student Union
(SU) Chair .lirn Tierney.

’ According to Snook, “all
schools" in the SUNY system have
expressed intcrcst in the “Tent Ci-
ty" idea. She said they are consider-
ittg participating cithcr irt Albany or
on their own campuses. “They are
waiting for its to set a date before

they decide," she added.

Meanwhile, SASU is waiting for
the ctrmpout approval, “We want

Shook, in order to protch students
who will volunteer both their tents

Snook said that "lots of students

“We must use our abundance of

Pulley also expressed his support
for thc Equal Rights Amendment

“That the Republicans and the
Democrats have not ratified the
ERA says volumes about their at-
titudes regarding women," he said.
“They do not really believe women
are equal."

rhancc in winning the presidential
election, he does not discontinue his
campaign. l-lis speech refreshingly
devoid of rehearsed campaign
rhetoric, Pullcy talks with people
on his campaign route about
speciﬁc issues, attempting to sell
his ideas more than he himself.
Pulley said that he “doesn‘t know"
if he will run again, and joked that
he “hopes not."
