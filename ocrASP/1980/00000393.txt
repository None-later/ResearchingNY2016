Drugs On Duty

Two former Aurora. Colorado.
policemen have ﬁled a $25 million
lawsuit. alleging that their superiors
ordered them to use drugs during

undercover operations — and thatt

they subsequently became addicted
to those drugs.

The officers, John Arco and Jack
Bisgard. say that they were required
to use cocaine and marijuana
regularly for the purpose of - in
their Words — “enticing suspects.
and gaining said suspects‘ trust in
order to effectuate drug-related ar-
rests.”

The suit alleges that as a result of
this so-called “forced use of
drugs," the two former cops
became "psychologically addicted
to said drugs.“ Their complaint
further contends that both of the
ex-officers now suffer from what
they describe as "acute clinical
psychosis and paranoia."

Police officials in Aurora say that
a sweeping investigation of possible
illegal drug use among the city's
undercover cops has been launched;

but they deny that drug use was re-
quired by the Police Department.

Among the defendants named in
the suit are Aurora’s mayor. its
police cltief. and its former police
chief.

A Casual Look!

Chickens have their “pecking
order.” and we humans scent to
have our “glancing order."

A Washington State University
study has found that when two
strangers meet for the first time. the
person who looks at the other a
fraction of a second longer is the

one who usually emerges as the top
rooster.

Researcher Eugene Rosa says
that this subtle exchange of gazes is
almost always unconscious. But.
according to Rosa, the length of
these glances seems to be a good
clue to a person‘s belief about his or
her own status.

 

Rosa says that other early tip-
off's as to who is likely to emerge as
the top dog include voice volume;
who's first to speak; posture; and
even eyebrow position.

Book Of Bloopers

Ronald Reagan‘s verbal political
bloopers over the years may cost
him a few votes if President
Carter's campaign aides have their
way.

Carter‘s campaign advisers: are
said to ltave compiled a 262-page
book of Reagan quotes. one-liners
and aphorisms made by the former
California Governor during the
past 15 years. The book has been
unofficially dubbed “The Oops
Report."

included in “The Oops Report"
are Reagan’s comments on
unemployment insurance. public
education. medicare and national
park expansion. to mention a few
areas.

For example, the book quotes
Reagan as saying that unemploy-
ruent compensation is for
“Freeloadcrs wanting a ore-paid

also quoted as saying that “Medical
care for the aged is a fool in the
door of a government takeover of
all medicine.”

According to the report. Reagan
opposed the expansion of Redwood
National Park in California by say-
ing: “A tree is a tree — how many
more do you need to look at?” And
on the question of public schools.
the presidential hopeful reportedly
quipped: “Promotion today in
most schools means that the child
has completed another year of at-
tendance without being con-
spicuously retarded compared to
the rest of the class.”

Oil Overflow

Here's a switch: A number of oil
industry sources are predicting that
the price of gasoline will start drop-
ping soon because of a huge glut of
oil on the market.

    

The Philadelphia Inquirer quotes
oil industry sources as stating that a
decline in demand for gas nation-
wide has resulted in a serious over-
supply. Many of the major oil corn-
panics are said to have ﬁlled tip all
their storage tanks and even to have
leased extra tankers to store the ex-
ccss crude.
