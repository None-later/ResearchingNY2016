BROCKPORT — The offense had
to get moving. It did, for 407 yards,‘
370 of which were on the ground.

The offense also had to put
points on the board. lt did — 42 of
them, and three touchdowns were
nullified because of penalties.

The defense had to stop the at-
tack of the fifth-rated passer in
Division III. it did, notching four
quarterback sacks, and keeping
their opposition out of the end zone
until it was far too late.

The special teams had to start
becoming a weapon — a force that
could inﬂuence ballgames. lt did,
with Albany defensive back Don
Bowen returning a punt 53 yards
for a touchdown. He also averaged

27 yards per‘ return on seven
chances.

Total these factors, and the result
is the 42-13 trouncing of the
Brockport State football team by
Albany Saturday for the Danes'
first victory —- in a game that
wasn‘t quite that close.

The win snapped'a five game
Dane losing streak (longest since
1922-23).

"l'm jtist glad to get a ‘w' (win)
at this point," said Albany head
coach Bob Ford.

The Dane mentor did have his
reservations tliotigli, mainly
because ofthe to penalties that cost
Albany 119 additional yards. Most
of those were lost at important
times — just ask Dane split end Tim~

The Albany State women's soccer
team traveled to Syracuse last
Saturday and came home with a 1-0
loss which does not justify their per-
formance.

Albany played well tlirottgliout
the first half, however, with five
mintrtes left, Syracuse scored the
only goal of the game.

“They scored in art unfortunate
situation," Albany coach Amy Kid-
der remarked. There was controver—
sy as to whether the Syracuse shot
was legal or not. But only one
referee was present during the
crime, arid he was not sure of the
legality of the shot. After sotiic
disptrte, the goal was awarded to
the Syracuse team.

Kidder remarked that the team's
performance was good, and they
played better than they have lately.

 

“The only problem was when our

Disputed Goal Only Score

defense broke down iii the first
half," she said.

In the second half, the Dane
hooters played exceptionally well
and dominated the game. Albany
took 45 shots, many of which were
launched from as far away as mid-
field. lri the last teti mintttes, the
Albany booters tried frustratingly
to score. Six shots were taken from
within the penalty box, brtt all miss-
1.

L'

' Syracuse only attempted nine
shots throughout the game, foitr of
which were saved by Albany junior
goalie Laurie Briggs.

Other fiue performances were
given by sophomore sweepcrback
Shari Miller and freshman standout
Lisa Vilice.

The team’s next ganre will be at
Castleton College tomorrow.

 

 

Voti'aw.

Three times did Votraw take the
ball into the end zone and three
times were his scored called back
because of Albany infractions. A
motion penalty took away the first I
— a 19-yard pass from Mike
Fiorito. The second, a 25-yard toss
from Tom Pratt, came back due to
an ineligible receiver dowrtfield call.
And the third, a ninc»yard reverse,
was nullified by a clipping foul. On
only one of those drives did Albany
get the score back. After the pass
from Pratt, Dane fullback Chuck
Priore pranced 40 yards through the
middle for a touchdown.

“Not disciplined," is what Ford
called the win. “I saw a lot of good
things...we didn’t do everything
right," he continued.

There were good signs, though,
the best being the offense. Satur-
day, it was the wishbone attack of
old, which meant a lot of running
and not mtich passing.

Priore led the Dane stampede for
the third consecutive week, netting
116 yards oti 18 carries. Ford now
has the stocky back doing double-
drity by alternating him at halfback
to ease the loss of Sam Haliston
(still out with a leg injury).

While l’riore wasn't at fullback,
sub John Durant was more than an
adequate replacement. The 5‘1 l"
and 2tX) pound junior was Albany's
number two rusher (72 yards, eight
carries). Levi Louis also had his
best day to date, with ()9 yards oii
10 carries.

The wishbone of old also means a
limited passing game. Starter
Fiorito was good on only one of
seven throws, totaling fottr yards,
with one interception. l’ratt, who
split tltc game with Fiorito, was a
bit more efficient (two of fotir for

33 yards).

But the force behind Albany’s of—

ferrsive surge was the line. They
opened the holes in Brockport's 5—2
defense that gave the Danes the
necessary advantage on the line of
scrimmage.

“They were just standing in their
base defense," said Albany guard
George Brodeur, “and we just ran
right at therii. They were stunting
(changing alignment), btit we knew
where they were going."

By the time David Cotter carried
the Dane defense four yards into
the endzone for Brockport's first
touchdown, Albany had another
score. By half-time, the Dane Zl-(i
advantage was enough.

"There was a point where you
knew the ballganie was won,“ said
Ford, who noticed an Eagle let-
down iri the second half.

Ford wasn’t that happy, though.
There are still some questions that
are unsettled, like the quarterback
situation. Fiorito and Pratt alter-
nated the entire game. "We're still
in the process of deciding," Ford
said about the problem of a starting
quarterback, one he's been facing
since tire-season.

The secondary is another ques-
tion for Ford to solve. The liagles
threw nine completions iii 18 tries
for 141 yards, with Albany iii-
tercepting two passes. Roy Volitoii,
Brockport's top 'L ver, caught
tlirce aerials for 75 yards, also. “We
rntist tighten up the pass defense a
little bit," said Ford. .

“There‘s still a couple of things
we rritist do," Ford said, looking to
next Saturday’s contest with For-
dltarrr. “But,” he continued,
“we're still not a good football
team.“

‘Best Field Ever’ In Dane Classic; Albany 9th

by Larry Kuhn

There was a little rain, a lot of
wind, and it was very cold — not an
ideal 'day for tennis. And yet they
came.

They came for the fourth annual
Great Dane Tctiriis Classic here on
Friday and Saturday. Sixteen teams
competed, traveling from as far as
Pennsylvania and Maryland ~ and
they came to play.

“This was definitely the best field
we have ever had in this tourna-
ment," said Albany tennis coach
Bob Lewis. “The weather was
brutal on Friday — it was very wiri-
dy and very cold. 1 ant personally
amazed at the caliber of play. It was
certainly not a day suited for tell-
nis.”

When it was
long matches,
Rochester, the

all over, after 135

the winner was
favorite, with 21
points. Tufts, competing in the
Classic for the first time, was se-
cond, with 18 points, followed by
Clark, Towsen State, and Williams.
Albany ﬁnished in a ninth place tie
with Rf‘l.

 

“I hoped that our team would
have l'inisrrcd higher in the tourna—
ment." said Lewis. “However, part
of the reason we didn‘t score higher
was the quality of the competition.
lixccpt in two instances, we drew
opponent» trom the top teams."

The tournament is set tip so that
lllL‘t‘ arr: nine different brackets,
one for first through sixth singles
and first through third doubles.
liach bracket consists of fottr single
'climinatiou rounds. One point is
awarded for each match won, so
that the player that wins eacft
bracket gets four points for his
team a semi-finalist winner gets
tltrce, and so on.

In first singles, Albany's Barry
Levine won his first round match

against Steve Knapp of St.
Michrtcls, bitt lost in the second
round to Matt Dillirtse of

Rochester, the number forit seed,
6~3, 6-4. Dilliase went on to the
finals before losing to third-seeded
Kevin Maguire of Iona.

The Danes' number two player,
Fred Gaber, also triumphed in the

first round, btit was defeated by
Howie Mendel of Ttifls in a tough
three setter, 6—2, 5—7, 6—2. The
closest match in the tournament
cainc in the finals of that bracket
where Paul Raymond of tuna edged
Bill Kahnlrom Clark. 7-(r, 6-7, 7-(r,
with the filial tiebreaker going to
'5—3.

in the third bracket, .Athrrrry
freshman Rob Karen tipsct the
number two seed from Iona, .loliri
(‘ocliraffe, in the openitig round,
6-3, (1-3, bttt lost iii round two in
straight sets to Paul Gill of
Rochester. Top seed Karl Brown
front Clark was upset in the final by
unseeded Greg Zaff of Williams,

 

6-2, 6-3.

in other singles action for
Albany, Dave Ulrich won his first
match, but lost to the second seed
in the second round. Andy Dia—
mond drew the trip seed in the fifth
liracket, .leff Uric from Towsen
State, and lost in three sets, 3-6,
6-2, 6-]. Drive l.erner lost his open»
irig rotttid tiirttch to liruce Mcuken
of Clark, who went on to the final
before dropping a tight three setter
to Mark Nesbil of l.eltigh, 1H», (i»2,
7—6.

Tire doubles brackets were
dominated by the teams from Tufts
who picked tip ll of 12 possible
points. They won first and second
doubles (both over Rochester) in-
cluding a dramatic Z-fr, 7-(r, 7-(r vic—
tory in the second spot, birt lost in
third doubles to Williams, 22-6, 6-2,
6~2.

Albany‘s first arid third doubles
teams lost iii the first roitrtd. Ditt-
mond and Dave Feitternian lost a
tough one to Towsen State in the
lliird position, 7-6, 5-7, 6-1. The
Danes‘ second doubles teatti was

the only bracket in which they made
it past the secortd round and they
did it by virttie of a forfeit. Karen
and Ulrich t~amed up to beat Clark
in the opener and then moved to the
semi-finals when Concordia
defaulted because of an injury.
They lost a three setter to the even-
triril winners from Tufts.

“Karen and Ulrich played pretty
well at second doubles rind are star»
ring to come together as a really
good doubles learn, which should
help its in the future,“ said Lewis.

l.ewis noted that tilitiost all of
Albany's matches were against the
top teams aritl that none of the
players played poorly. He said,
"Although our guys didn‘t score

. highly, we were competitive in all
out losses. We played it lot of tlitec
setters -— I'm not happy about los«
iiig three setters, bttt at least it pro-
ves we're competitive. It‘s just that
we're a little tioteli lower than some
of the other learns."

He added, “it was it very stic-
cessful tournament. My three‘hig-
