‘Yer Smoke Gets

by Beth Cammarata

I like to eat. I don't like to
smoke. But there's only one vacant
seat in the whole cafeteria, and its
scrawny frame is shrouded in
smoke.

 

 

A News FEATURE

 

 

I rub my eyes-and peer at the wall
behind it. “NO SMOKING.” it
says — in bold red letters, no less. I
am becoming peeved, Rapidly. Ara
I ttot American? [)0 I not have the
right to eat my cheese and crackers
(and apple) without simultaneously
inhaling cancer causing agents'.’

but wail. The University Senate
says I do. As oprril. I978, univer—
clty policy dictates that smoking is
not permitted in classrooms. lecture

halls, and laboratories, and. as of

I‘ebrrrar'y, 1979, it is not permitted
in the end of the (‘ampus (‘entcr
cafeteria farthest from the deli. rtor

 

in the Patroon Lounge, Fireside
Lounge, and meeting rooms 370.
373, 375. 356, 358, 357, and 361.
This policy is an extension of the
NYS public health law Chapter 80,
which prohibits' smoking in all
public means of mass transporta-
tion and any indoor facility open to
the public as a library. museum. or
theater. Also designated as “no
smoking" areas are the gym and art
gallery, sirtcc both are public
facilities.

But back to my problem. The
laws are useless if they‘re not en-
forced. Who can I turn to? I
queried inwardly. In desperation, I
approached the CC Information
Desk.

“Where should l go to complain
about smokers iii the non—smoking
area of the cafeteria?" I risked.
“(to no further," mroth shc behind
tltc desk aml whipped ortt a
"smoking complaint" form, much
to my ama/cmcrrr.

And so, I filled it out. "Where do
I bring it?" I asked. And again she
replied, “00 no further. We‘ll send
it to the Dean for Student Affairs,
Neil Brown's, ofﬁce for you." And
I was pleased.

The next morning. a letter from
Director of Student University Ac-
tivities in the CC James P.
Doellcfcld was in my mailbox. He
wished to discuss the incident. it
said. Would I please call?

I decided to visit Mr. Doellefeld.
He -\vas very pleasant about the
whole matter. "This is the first
complaint I've received, and I’ve
been director of the Campus Center
for four years." he said. I was not
surprised. Had it not been for a dire
stroke of fate and pure desperation
(see above), he would not have
received any at all. For it is evident-
ly not common knowledge that one
cart lodge an official complaint
against any violator of a trott-
