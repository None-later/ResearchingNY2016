Albany Student Press

- Some Sound Advice for Stereo Shopping .

by Matt Haddad

. Many students feel that all they
need to know about a good stereo is
“how many watts" it has. They
recall the times spent in a friend's
suitcroom nodding out to an ear-
splitting rendition of Santana's
"Soul Sacrifice." However. there is
much more to stereo buying than
just macho amps and kick-ass
speakers.

A good stereo must produce a
clean crisp sound. This can only be
accomplished through buying a
system of high quality components.

When talking about a system of

components. WC mean a separate

and tuners). amplifier. and

sists of three pieces: two

However, the great majority of
compacts don't even approach high
ﬁdelity — which literally means
“true to the original source."
Getting high ﬁdelity at the right
price is what stereo shopping is
about. It will require a lot of time
and a’bit of research. but if you're
determined enough not to quit ear-
ly. the reward will sound great.
Basically. the art of stereo shopping
can be broken into three stages.
Stage one involves checking out

tions such as signal to noise ratio,
damping factor, tracking error, etc.
These ﬁgures are Very important
since they indicate the quality of the
components. -

The next stage. the most vital to
the inexperienced stereo‘buyer, is
research. There really is no central
source where the lay person can
look for all the current informa-
tion. Around the late sixties a slew
of stereo guides were published but

- since electronics is a rapidly chang-

ing field. they are obsolete.
However, if you honestly thought
that "wow" and “flutter'Vwcre a
gay comedy duo than you should
probably try Slereo Review's series
of reprints. (available at two dollars
each from Stereo Review Reprints.
P.O. Box 278I Pratt station,
Brooklyn. NY. “205). ln addi-
tion, you should try and find
magazines that. rate the latest
systems and components.

After studying some basic ter-
minology and getting a feeling for
the good names in the field. we
come to the question of how much
should you spend. Though there are
not real solid rules on the sllhjLCl. it
is safe to say that the minimum
umonnr to spend on :1 true high
fidelity component system is
ruountl 5.400.

lhis is pure nonsense since the

Also try to keep in mind that il~
you‘re only willing to spend $600. il
would be wise in bargain all about
$‘l00 less. Most of the limc. the
sruarl sulcsmun will hear your price
and show you something for $50
more. Thus, if he tries to tempt you
this way. Ihc stcrco will still be
within your price range.

Suffice it to say that stereo buy-
ing lakes nl lCtlSl zr fundamental
knowledge of the science of high
fidelity and it good deal of patience.
The consumer must always be
aware that buying 11 stereo is a ma-
jor irrvcslmcnl well worth the lime
and effort. Once you purchase your
system make sure you understand
ils limitations (every system has
them). if your receiver can only
generate 20 watts per channel. do
not use it for a quad party. Take
good care of your stereo and it will
reward you with clean crisp‘ sound
at the ﬂick of a switch.
