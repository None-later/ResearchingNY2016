Tampon Alarm

A California microbiologist is
claiming that toxic shock syn-
drome. the newly discovered illness
striking women who use tampons.
may actually be scarlet fever.

Patrick Scltlicvert. Assistant Pro-
fessor of Microbiology and im-
munology at U.C.L.A., says that
toxic shock syndrome looks artd
acts exactly like scarlet fever. He
says, for example. that the symp-
toms of toxic shock -— a pinkish red
skin rash. fever. diarrhea. low
blood pressure and shock — all cor-
respond to tire symptom of scarlet
fever.

Schlicvert says he examined the
body ﬂuid frorn 100 toxic sltock
syndrome patients. including a few
men and a woman who did not use
tampons. He reports that in all
cases. the bacterial toxin itt the fluid
behaved exactly like a scarlet fever
toxin.

Scientists researching toxic shock
syndrome have attributed the
disease to a kind of staplt bacteria.
Schlievert says that although scarlet
fever is usually caused by streptoc-
eal bacteria. not staph germs, sortie
scientists still think staph germs do
at times cattse scarlet ten-r.

Says Scltliewrt. "I'm saying it‘s
the sante disease. lt'sjusl that some

Macho Mess

A Los Angeles psychotherapist
claims that macho mcn ntake ab-
solutely “lousy” husbands.

Dr. Herb Goldberg says he
believes that these so-callcd
“macho males" are — in his words
— “self-destructive neurones".

“Atba‘n'y Student Press 

fessor at California State Universi-
ty. says he has interviewed more
than 2000 female patients. and has
found that an increasing number of
seemingly impassive. submissive
women are walking out on their he’
man-type husbands.

One woman interviewed by
Goldberg prtt it this way: "l‘m fed
up with living with a hollow guy irt a
dead excuse for a marriage. He
seemed to be such alive wire. btrt he
turned ortt to be a dud. . .alive at
20. a machine at 30. burrth out by
40.”

Said another of her cx-huhhy: “i
couldn‘t stand his fear of feeling.
No joy left irt hint. No love. l‘rcdic-
table. Mechanical. A sleepwalking
zombie. B-o-r-ing."

Rings and Things

Just a few years ago astronomers

thought only one planet — Saturn
—- had rings around it. Then. in
I977. five faint rings were detected
around Uranus. .

Last year, the Voyager spacecraft
photographed a thin ring of reddish
particles around .lupitcr. as it pass-
ed that giant planet on the way to
Saturn.

Now. Slur d- .S'lr_r' magazine says
the Earth may once have had rings
as well. The magazine reports that
Dr. .lolttt ()‘Keefe of the Goddard
Space Flight ("enter suggests that
lzarth possessed a ring system —
trot once. brtl several times in the
past.

()‘Kecfc says the lamb ltad rings
as recently as 600.000 years ago. He
adds lltc rings were created when a
lttrtar \olcano blasted debris direct~

 

ly at the Earth.

Perfumed Passion

Women wearing perfume may
turn men on if women are dress-
ed in jeans. but they seem to turn
the males off if the women are
wearing skirts instead.

At least. that’s what Purdue
University researcher Robert Baron
found out in a recent experiment.

Baron paired male and female

 

college students. and then asked
them to rate the women according
to attraction and social perception:
some women wore jeans and a drop
or two of Jungle Gardenia perfume;
other women were the perfume and
a skirt. blouse and hose; and still
others didn't wear the perfume at
all.

Baron reports that when the
women were dressed casually and
also dubbed on some perftttne. men
found tltcm warm and ro.n;~rttic.
However. if the women were tttore
formally dressed and wore the same
perfume. the men found them to be
colder attd less romantic.
