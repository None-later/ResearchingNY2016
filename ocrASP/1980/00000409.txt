gued. “the van was broken before
it left" for Christmas vacation."
artinez had returned to SUNYA
ring the vacation to work on the
ultural Festival and the Martin
utllcr King Celebration that took
lace in January.

"I took the van for repairs on a
liurs'day and picked it up on Mon-
ay." said Martinez. According to
ariincz. the van was left in Cruz
utonlotivcs on Central Avenue for
to weekend and was later left at
Ibalty Dodge for‘tltrec (lays.
Mttrtincz also said he used tltc
:tigltl

    
  
   
 
 
 
  

when he worked late at the SA of-
fice. “The buses stopped running at
5 p.m.," he said.

In an earlier ASP article
Weinstock agreed that Martinez
had used the van for SA business.

Martinez suggested Ihat perhaps
‘hc van was used during the time it
was left in the automotive shops.

Levy also said that it is “not int-
plausible" that Martinez did ltot
usc the van because mo SA groups
claimed they lost the keys to tltc
van. Perhaps. lcty vcnturcd. they
had set aside the keys. Tltc van is.
