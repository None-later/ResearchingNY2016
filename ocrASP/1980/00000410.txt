)y Ellen Porcelll

Wednesday night in the Universi-
1y gym, the Albany State wopten's
volleyball team was victor’iﬁs, by
taking matches from Russell Sage
and Sierra Colleges wltile losing oiin
to Binghamton. who they had never
played before.

The Danes defeated Russell Sage
in the first match by scores of l5-8
and l5-6.

In the next match lllt
on Biiighamton and lost ll' three
tough sets. 7-15. lS-l2. 11—15. The

rllllr'

' teaiii almost pulled it out iii lll

final gatite with the regular starters
sitting orri in the beginning. Albany
wotrteit's coach Pat Dwyer partly
blames the loss on himself for not

 

making better tise of ltis substitu-
trons.

Albany won the final match of
the evening over Sierra College by
scores of l5-12 and 15-7.

The two wins raised the learn
reeore to 4-3. Last Saturday night
they defeated Kings College in fotir
sets arid received credit fora witi iii
a forfeit front Rutgers-Newark.

Despite the girls winnirtg five of
the seven sets played on Wednesdav
irit'ht, Dwyci was not too pleased.
"l‘hey didn't play too well as a
it“ tin." he said.

\ lack til experienced players
could be it factor for their iioi play-

Holmes Wins

Squires.

l’IOlHTCS earned $3.5 million plus
a percentage of other revenue front
the fight that drew 1i sellout crowd
of 26.790 to a specially built out-
door arena iii ii ('aesars Palace
pai‘kinglot and a record live gate of
$5 million.

Holntes’ greatest triumph and
Ali's saddest moment also were
viewed on closed circuit television
in about 350 locations iii the United
States and Canada and was beamed
live and on a delayed basis to about
60 other countries. it will be seen on
ABC-TV iii the United States at a
later date.

The loss was Ali's fourth against
56 victories. and gave Holmes his
27th knockotit.

Ali first won the title by stopping
Sonin Liston in seven round in
l974. After losing it because of his
draft evasion conviction, he regain-
ed it against l’orctnaii, and then had
his title-losing and winning bouts
with Spinks.

Before the fight. which Ali said
was sure to be his latest miracle. Ali
had said he planned to keep the title
and the glory — at least in the ring
— are past tense for the man who
burst on the boxing scene in 1960 as
Cassius Clay. it wise-cracking young
man from Louisville, Ky.

Dundee said he asked Green to
stop it “because there was nothing
left after the ninth round."
lronieally before the fight. All had
said he \vould win in nine or less.
