The Albany State mcn’s varsity
cross-country team traveled
Wednesday afternoon to Hartwick
College to face Cortland ﬁnd Hart-
wick in il tri-mcet.

The Harriers entered the meet
sporting a rather dismal 0-6 record.
The last time the Danes lost that
many consecutive mccts was in
I976.

The Danes pulled out a 17-46 vic-
tory over Hartwick but dropped the
race to Cortland 19-38 to achieve a
split on the afternoon. Although
Albany lost to Cortland, Dane
coach Bob Munsey felt “the meet
was tnuch closer than it looked."
Cortland “really dominated" the
meet, said Munscy, taking the top

Albany's runner of the meet went
to Casey Carlstrom for his efforts in
placing sixth. Sophomore Chris
Lani ran seventh with Todd Silva
pulling in eleventh, and Tim
Bradley twelfth.

“Less than twenty seconds could
have made all the difference in the
world. The mcet would have been a
totally different story. Anyhow. it's
awful nice to get a Win. Real nice to
break a losing streak. The thing that
encouraged me the most was the

to Williams. 19-39, and to Vermont
by the score of 2043.

"The race was dominated by
both Williams and Vermont." said
Munscy. "it was one of the saddest
races of all times."

James, Albany's stronghold.
“ran a decent race. He should have
won it,” said Munscy of his top
runner who finished second. The
next best ﬁnisher for the harricrs
was Carlstrom. who placed four-
tccnth.

The Danes meet with Colgate this
Saturday in “the battle of two not-
so-strong teams." according to
Munscy. Albany has won the last
six. decisions over Colgate with
rather competitive scores. but
"hopefully we'll be able to beat
them," said Mttnscy
