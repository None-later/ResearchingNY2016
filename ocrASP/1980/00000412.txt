Rooters Dropped

by Marc Haspel

When the Hartwick College soc-
cer team marched onto the Bleecker
Stadium field to face Albany
Wednesday evening, you knew the
Danes were in for a real tough
game. Afterall. Hartwick is a highly
ranked Division 1 team while
Albany competes in Division til. it
was a contest that Albany could
hardly have expected to win without
an outstanding effort. They did
provide a strong challenge but in a
losing effort. 4-1.

 

 

 

“l'm far from disappointed. We
showed that we're a quality team.
Hartwick played with intensity and
we played a better game because of
it," said Dane soccer coach Bill
Schieffelin.

The opening half of play provid-
ed the approximately one thousand
fans at Bleecker with a close scoring
brand of end to end action. Both
teams traded scoring aoppor-

trrnities, but Hartwick seemed more
consistent in sending the ball on
goal.

however, Hartwick only led l-0.
The one goal came off the foot of
Tom Kent who beat Dane
goalkeeper Alberto Giordano on
the right side at the 15:36 mark.
Giordano. as well as the entire
defense. had a line evening. The
goalkeeper stopped 24 to 28 shots-
on-goal including several tremen-
dous saves on difﬁcult screened
shots. Also, fullbacks Keith
Falconer and Luis Arango, both of

ing Hztrlwick's passing offcttsc.

Ofl'ctrsively. it was Arartgo's well
worked set up on a free kick that
provided tlte Danes with their best
scoring chance of the first ltalf.
Arango chipped the ball over Hart-
wiek’s wall where Leslie Severe. -
who had to later leave the game
with a tton-seriotrs bruised knee,
stepped itt to boot it jttst wide of the
net.

 

Still. Albany cottld ortly ntakc
ttitte shots on goal. The Danes 0f-
fensive probletns mainly lay in their
inability to play the inside. Scent-
ingly, everytimc Albany penetrated
l'lartwick's end either the Dane for-
wards were caught offsides or plays
were broken up by the fast Hart-
wick defenders.

“They (Hartwick) were strongest

usually ptrt your best guys." said
Dane midfielder Vlado Sergoviclt.

scoreboard for the ﬁrst time with an
unassisted shot on which Hartwiek
goalkeeper Raly Anderson had little
chance.

The Dane tally came at a point in
the game when Albany was gambl-
ing heavily in order to net one by
sending all the players up field.
Hartwick. however, capitalized on
this situation by scoring one last
time via Owen Rose to complete the

“They still had to play hard. even

division levels)." said Sergovich.
“We gave them a good game," he
continued.

Schieffelin agreed with

could handle." the coach said.

by Larry Kahn

The Albany State men’s tennis
team is off to their best start in five
years as they added two ntore wins
this week to up their record to 5-0.
On Wednesday the Danes over-
powered a weak RPI team. 8-1.
after pulling out a tough one over
Hamilton on Tuesday, 6-3.

The Danes haven’t had the luxury
of such a quick start since 1975
when they finished the fall season at
6.0, and since l969 when they were
lO-O.

“We're off to a good start
because we have good balance."
said Albany tennis coach liob
Lewis. “Our fresltntert frotn last
year have a year's experience urtdcr
their belts plus the addition of Dave
Ulrich and Rob Karen has helped."
Lewis also cited improved doubles
play as a major factor.
