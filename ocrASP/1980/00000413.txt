It was a mismatch.

The end came with Ali sitting on
his stool between the 10th and llth
rounds after Holmes had battered
him defenseless in the ninth and
tentlt.

Cornerman Angelo Dundee
signalled to referee Richard Green
that All had had enough, although
some of Ali’s cornermen seemed to
want the tight to continue.

Dundee told the referee: “The
ballgame is over. l'm the chief se»
cond attd l'm stopping the ﬁght.“
The action gave Holmes ltis eighth
consecutive knockout in defense of
the World Boxing Council title.

followed by a right uppercut.
Before the round was out, he pinn-
ed Ali in his corner and hit him with
ﬁve jabs, missed a right, and then
hit him with seven'more jabs and a
left-right to the head.

it was sad to watch the end to
what had been a legendary career.
Ali earned $8 million plus a percen-
tage of the ancillary revenue and,
on this night in 89-degree heat, lte
earned every penny of it. it turned
out to be one of the easiest fights in
the career of Holmes, who weighed
211'/t,and it got the All monkey off
the Easton. Pa., fighter's back.

Holtrtcs, who helped Ali prepare
for many title bouts in the early
1970‘s as a sparring parttter, ltas liv-
ed in Ali‘s shadow for several years.
Ali fans called him a phony cham-
piott because he had never beaten
his one-time master in the ring.

Ali himself said that Holmes had
beaten him several times iii the gyrtt,
bttt it would be a different story
when money and glory were on the
line. It wasn't. it was pathetic.

After the figltt was stopped, Ali
sat for several ntinutcs on his stool,
his face badly marked below ltoth
eyes and those eyes glazed — as ifitt
a drcattt, a bad dream.

Ali was altlc to leave the rirtg attd

a 5.5 yard average. His runn—
ingmate, fullback Craig Miller,
(60, 210 pounds) grounded out HO
yards iii 19 entries last weekend,
boosting his seasonal tally to 170
yards iii 40 carries.

Before Ali left the ring, Holmes
walked to him and said: “You were
great champion.”

Holmes deﬁnitely is atop the
heavyweight world now, and his
next opponent probably will be
Leon Spinks, who took the title
from All on Feb. 15, 1978 and lost
his World Boxing Association por-
tion back to Ali on Sept. 15, 1978 in
what was Ali's last figltt until
Thursday night.

Holmes spearcd Ali with hard
jabs to the face and body
throughout the figltt, as Ali did lil-
lle. On the Associated Press card,
Ali did not win a round.

Spinks earned a title shot promis-
ed by Don King, probably it
February, by knocking out No.
'l-ranked Bernardo Mercado in the
ninth round of a sclteduled
lS-round elimination match earlier
on the card.

Ali simply could ttot escape
Holtnes' rapier jabs arid bombing
combinations to the head and body,
no matter what he tried. He danced
anti tuoved. He feinted with his
head. He tried the rope-a-dope
made famous when he rcgaittcd the
title for the secortd time when lte

knockout.

Ali seemed on his way to winning
the seventh round, moving well and
scoring with several jabs, although
they were not the famed jab of past
fights.

in the ﬁnal minute of the routtd,
Holmes cante on and jolted Ali witlt
four stiff jabs. He sent Ali to the
ropes with a hard right to the head,
then another rigltt.

It was the beginning of the ettd.

Ali’s corner, led by Drew Dundini
Brown, pleaded for the forrtter
cltamp to get going, bttt he just
didn't have the gas. After a couple
of rounds, his brother Ralttttan, ran
up the steps to the corner, to try to
rally Ali. But cltcerlcading was just
ltot air on this night.

Ali was just a shell on this night,
as reflected on the cards of the tltrcc
judges. Each of tltettt gave Holmes
all 10 rounds. Chuck Mirtker of Las
Vegas scored it 100-90, as did
Ricltard Steels of Los Angelcs.
Duane Ford of Las Vegas saw it
100-89.

ironically, most of those landlords
who spoke against the ordinance
were not even Albany residents.
Many were from Lake George.
Their concern was only with the
property itself, its monetary value,
not the quality of living condition
which mttst be endured by its
tenants.

One after another, the landlords
alluded to the additional expenses
of the ordinance requirements such
as installation of deadbolt locks,
solid core exterior doors. pin bolts
for secure closing of windows and
adequate lighting for cntranceways.

Some owners expressed common
beliefs that “the security ordinance
would not stop break-ins," attd that
"locks are only a way to keep the
honest people ottt." There were
landlords who said that tuore sccutc
apartments "would lock disasters
(such as fire) itt."

Matty owners said that tenants
don't use existing locks and could
ttot “see why they (tenants) don't
wattt to pay for their owtt increased
secttrity." Tenants, they atgtted,
“would pay for it lit the long-run
anyway."

Property Owners Association
President John l~'ctiitttore said that
totttl compliance with the proposed
ordinance would cost $7.75 tttilliott
for 20,000 ltotrsittg units. llc
cstitttatcd that total rents would in-

crease by more than one million
dollars, with the security cost per
apartment rising to 5340.

But the Albany Alliance for Safe-
ty calculated costs to be much lower
with deadbolt locks at costs ranging
from under $8 to 525. They sug-
gested that the prices for more ex-
pensive measures such as plexiglass
or protective screens be deducted as
part of income tax reports since
they are all depreciable items.

The crowd grew restless. At least
100 people sat on edge in the coun-
cil chambers. The rest overflowed
ottt into the hallways.

meeting continued in a similar pat-
tern, broken up by outbursts such
as the reaction to the

change. '

The audience fell into an uproar
when a landlord claimed that “girls
invited intrusion" by
demonstrating "carelessness."
They spoke as though the molesters
came to homes like girl scouts sell-
ing cookies.

One aghast listener shouted,
"How would you like your
