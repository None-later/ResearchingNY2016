“LEAP” Stresses Liberal Arts

by Nora Kirby

This semester 280 freshmen are
involved in a new academic pro-
gram which stresses liberal arts and
personalized education. according
to Center for Undergraduate
Education (CUE) Director Dr.
Stanley Schwartz.

Liberal Education Advancement
Program (LEAP) “offers students
an opportunity to study liberal arts
courses iii an environment con-
ducive to liberal arts courses."
Schwartz said.

According to the brochure sent
out to all freshman. the students
who volunteered to take part in this
pilot progrztttt‘ttrc expected to trike
one of the special LliAP courses
each semester for their first four
semester's lterc at Albany.

[Each class is worth four credits
and twelve of these courses are of-

fered each semester. As explained in
the brochure. the classes are divided
into six categories: Values. Natural
Sciences. Syntbolics. Literature arid
the Fine Arts. Cultures of tire Past
and Social Science.

Scltwart/ said these six categories
do not match tip with Unixcrsity
departments btrt are all 110“ and are
"designed for students wlto \\ ant to
take some intellectual risks."

According to one student in\o|\-
ed with LEAP. Janet \\'cber.
regular tttti\crsity classes and LliAP
classes are “worlds apart." Weber.
who is interested itt Pic-Med, takes
the LEAP class entitled. lirouticrs
in Geology artd "loves it."

She said tltcrc are IR to 20
students in the class and it is much
better than a lecture typc course.
Weber explained that in the class.
there is opportunity for student to

student and student to instructor in-
teraction.

Another freshman in LEAP.
Patricia Brosnan. likes the program
because “it’s a chance to get a more
liberal education." Brosnan. who
takes Morality. Wickcdness and
Happiness. says there is a great deal
of work involved and she is not
“hrccring through". "I wouldn't
say the class is tougher. It makes me
think more." said Brosnan.

Schwartl. said LEAP was design-
ed to stress such aspects Of educa-
tiort as writing skills. reading skills.
and oral skills.

According to what Brosnan had
to stt_\ about her class. all of these
skills are bciltg takctr care of arid in
a wry enthusiastic manner. She said
thc class has a great deal of required
readings. short papers each week
and class discussions during which
people are expected to gitc Ilrcit
tie“ on things.

The l liAl’ program was designed
by the Special (‘onmrittee on
Undergraduate leucation to the

Campus Safety Commission

.lNew Academic Program Initiated for Fresh

University Senate. The committee
was constituted by President
O'Lcary in August 1978.

Eugene Garbcr. chairman of the
special committee since September
1978. explained that the committee
which consisted of five students and
13 faculty members. submitted .a
report to SUNYA faculty on possi-
ble models for Liberal Education at
SUNYA.

The seven page report. which also
appeared in the March 6. 1979 issue
of the ASP. explains eight different
models of liberal education and in-
cludes a sheet on which one could
evaluate the models presented.

Front the responses received. the
committee designed what (iarbcr
calls art eclectic ttrodcl which is tltc
best aspects of scxcral models corti—
bittcd.

The bill was passed by the
Urri\crsity Senate on May 14. 197‘)
and “as then rrpprotcd by President

according to Garbcr. He sees LEAP
as a more ﬂexible approach to

proximately $220.000 in fire preven-

Alumni ()nud's Suylcs and

in the same category as Commoner
and Clark. Mrs. Carter hesitated
briclly. then replied "he is a minor
candidate.“

Mrs. Carter showed a slight lapse
of poise only once. when it reporter
asked her response to Anderson’s
wile Keke’s comment that Mrs.
Carter “spread herself too thin“ in
her role as first lady.

“You can make what you want
of the position of first lady." Mrs.
Carter replied. "I ltavc worked on
marry issues, as I feel a responsibili-
ty. . .l could pour tea all day and
still be criticized."

Mrs. Carter remarked finally that
“the major disappointment of the
last four years is that the ERA has
nor'hcen ratified andrthat is my goal
ip’ylhe next four years."
