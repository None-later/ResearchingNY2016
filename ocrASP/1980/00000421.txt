Bears Maul Buccaneers By 23-0

(AP)Quarlerback Mike Phipps roll-
ed to his right for 5 yards and his
first touchdown rushing in six years
then sneaked for another
touchdown in the final minute of
play, and Bob Thomas booted field
goals of 30.44 and 29 yards Monday
night to lead the Chicago Bears to a
23-0 victory over tlte Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.

Until Phipps scored his
touchdown to give the Bears a 10-0
lead midway in the third quarter. a
national television audience was all
but lulled to sleep by two inept of-
fcnses.

The first half was a punting duel
between Chicago‘s Bob Parsons
and Tampa Bay‘s Tom Blanchard.
interrupted only by Thomas'
30-yard field goal in the second
quarter to give Chicago a 3-0
halftime lead.~

Phipps completed passes of 2i
yards to Bob Fisher and 13 yards to
James Scott to set up the field goal.
Together. the two teams managed
only l73 net yards iii the first half.

The Bears came to life in the se-
cotid half when a 39-yard ptint by
Parson was downed on the Bucs' 2
by Kris Haines. The Bites were forc-
ed to punt back and Phipps hit
Brian Baschiiagel with a 37-yard
pass to the Tampa Bay 5 before he
rolled to his right and rambled into
the end zone for his first TD by
rushing since l974, when he was
with Cleveland.

The next titnc the Bears gained
possession. they moved from their

own 40 to the Tampa Bay 27 on the

running of Walter Payton before
Thomas booted his 44-yard ﬁeld
goal.

The victory broke a two-game
losing streak for the Bears and left
both teams with 2-3 records as the

Buccaneers suffered their third
straight loss.
Early in the fourth quarter,

Phipps fumbled and Dewey Selnton
recovered on the Chicago 23-yard
line to give the Bucs an excellent
scoring chance.

But quarterback Doug Williams.
sacked twice earlier by Dan Hamp-
ton. was hit by James Osborne and
fumbled with Alan Page recovering
for Chicago on the 2i.

Payton. held to only it yards
rushing in the first half. then
spearheaded a drive by carrying
eight times for 50 yards to set tip
Tliomtis' 29-yard field goal with
6:45 left in the game to give tltc
llcttrs ti lo-(l lead.

On the next play. Williams hit
Jimmie Giles with what appeared to
be a l2-yard TD pass but center
Steve Wilson was ﬂagged for

holding. Another holding penalty.‘

against guard Greg Roberts. moved
the Bucs back to the Chicago 32.
Williams missed on two passes
before Garo Yepremian tried a
49-yard field goal which was block-
ed by Page.

With 5‘/:minuies left to play.
Williams was sacked by Page and
left the game.

The shutout was the third in the
last three years administered by the
Bears to the Buccaneers. Chicago
shut out Tampa Bay IO-O lil 1977
and again 14-0 last December.

Phipps finished lti-for-2l for lltl
yards and Williams was 9-fot -2tl for
89 yards.

Danes’Nearing An Answer

by Bob Belilflore

Saturday's Albany-Fordham game was full of good things if you're
Great Dane football fan. it was Albany's second consecutive win. The

opponents were 20-25 pounds larger per man on the offensive and ‘

defensive lines, yet the Danes still won the battle in the pits. The
Albany defense kept a talented Ram backﬁeld from running rampant.
And when Fordham did score twice in a row (at the end of the third
qttarter and start of the fourth), it was more like the Albany defense
had let down.as Dane defensive end Erie Singlctary put it.

There was one thing to worry about. 'though. For one reason or
another, two of Albany's top three haifbacks would not play, and the
other, Jack Burger. was doubtful for action. Then Bill Machado. the
nest back on the depth chart. came up with a leg injury in mid-week.
This meant that junior Bob Nearing would get the starting

nod. Nearing gave Dane fans one more thing to smile about. The '

5-8, l65 poiinder grounded out 82 yeards in only 12 carries (just over
6.8 yards per carry). and was second only to Fordham's Craig Miller
(85 yards) in the game. But. Nearing’s totals and signiﬁcance in this
important gar it: for both teams earned him the game's Most Valuable
Player award. voted on by members of the press.

in training camp. Nearing was battling Machado for the third
halfback spot after Sam Haliston got lnirt. Then. he badly injured his
ankle. and saw no action against botlt lthaca and Southern Connec-
ticut. At Brockport. he ran four times for 22 yards in a limited role.

‘i knew i was ready." Nearing said. “it just felt really good play-
tug.“

Halfbiick coach (inry Reynolds noicd that the layoff had lturt Near-
ing‘s on-tltc-ficld learning. btii that “he doesn‘t make mistakes. Men-
lttlly. we kneu lie was ready. lie just responded greatly — great on-
thusittsm."

"He's a bright spot. lie cult dojust about anything.“ Reynolds con-
tinned.

“it felt great." thu'iug said about the MVP uwttrd. given to him
after tltc game. “I wits l‘L‘illl)’ surprised. though. All the bucks did real-
ly great."

"i figure that Levi's still got the iipper hand because he played last
year." said thtring about the now-existing battle for the starting job.
“lint they've got to consider me after Saturday's game."

"He run well. blocked well." said Albany head coach linb l-‘ord.
“We‘re going to play hint."
