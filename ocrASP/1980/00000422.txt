“The line was excellent," said
Albany center Mikc Arcurl. whose
job was to handle Forditarn middle
guard Tom Carra. “it was like one
guy playing -—— not five guys. it was
like a machine."

Albany was effective in stopping
the potent Fordham running game.
giving up only 141 yards. However.
the pass defense was less than suc-‘
cessful in shutting down the Ram
air attack. Matt Zakrewski took
over at quarterback for starter
Steve Colosimo with just over one
minute to go in the first half, and
his Rams down 9-0. He completed .
his first five aerials and guided it‘or- i

secutivc possessions of tire second
half.

Zakrewskl scored the first

terception. Tlte second was a two

Juan Pacheco on the third play of
the fourth quarter. The Forditam
play-caller finished the gantc with
10 completions irt 17 attempts for
154 yards. artd one intcrceptiott (by
linebacker Tom Dalton).

Albany head coach Bob Ford
utilized an unusual strategy irt the
first quarter. Fully realizing Por-
dham's superior size and strength
on defense, the Dane offense did
not huddle at all during the first
period, with Fiorito calling every
play from the litre of scrimmage.

“From the scouting report. we
knew they were big but slow to the
outside." Fiorito said. “We tried to
out-quick them to the outside. Tltcy
were tired — we could see. And the
offensive line played like hell."
Ford added, “We did not think
they were in great shape."

The other reason for Ford’s
“oxygen offense" was to prevent
any shifting by the Fordham
defense which would confuse the
Dane offense, according to Arcuri.
“They just stayed in their base
defense and we knew where they
were going to be." he said. Ford
said that he wanted to "catch them

There was some encouragement

Doctors are monitoring Bicc’s

Surgery will be performed when the

Whether Bice recovers completely

Regan recalled the play when
Bicc was injured:

“Catan caught the bail. and
Frank hit him with a shoulder
tackle. The jolt did the damage. He
didn’t move. The coaches ran out
to him. He said he couldn‘t feel
anything. Then both teams left the
field until tltc atttbulance came arid
took him away.”

"it looked like a normal tackle

ble situation. But itt football you
take that chance every time you go

Williams team. Clarkson had also
improved greatly since last season.

Dane Bats Silenced In Doubleheader Sweep

Lately the Albany State baseball
team's hitting attack has been like

scored one run while dropping botlt '

ends of a doubleheader to Cor-
tland. 4-1 and 4-0.

Albany coach Rick Skecl. par-
tially blamed the Danes' rather
sluggish offensive showing Satur-
day on the tardiness of their team
bus. The Danes arrived in Cortlattd
only an ltottr and a ltalf before
game time, denying titcm their pro-
