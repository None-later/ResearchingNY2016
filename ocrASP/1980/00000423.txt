"i guess the big difference was
intensity," said Dane defensive cap-
tain Steve Shoen. “This week. the
defense was fired up. We didn't
want what happened last year
(when Albany lost to the Rams in

This time. it was the Danes' turn

that pitted Fordham's size and
strength against Albany's speed and
quickness. with the latter having the
edge.

Br0ckport was the victim of
Albany's good fortune as the Danes
defeated their opponents 2—1, in
overtime. Saturday afternoon.

The main character in Albany's
victory was goalie Alberto Gior—
dano. The Dane tender was at the
enr‘ of 44 Brockport shots and had
to come tip with tremendous saves
on eight occasions.

“Alberto didn't play a good
game, he played an exceptional
one." commented Albany soccer
coach Bill Schieffelin.
was also the recipient of some good
luck. Two Brockport shots hit the
cross bar. which could have easily
been two goals.

lronically. the team’s only major
mistake was caused by Giordano.
At 25:00 in the first half. a
Brockport player chipped the ball
into the penalty area. Giordano
came out for the ball, but didn’t call
for ii. Keith Falconer. not hearing
anything from the goaltender. tried
to head the ball wide of the goal. it
ended up in the goal, and the Eagles
led, 1-0.

The score remained that way as
the half ended. Schieffelin calmly
told the team at the halftime
meeting what most probably knew
—— they tnust take the action into
the Brockport end.

The Danes didn’t take long to
heed the advice of their coach. at
0:47 of the final half. Albany got on
the scoreboard. Falconer brought
the bail downfield and hit Afrim

Albany did what they had to do to

"This is one of the few times we
were dominated throughout a soc-
cer game and won. We simply made
the key plays," said Schieffelin.
“Our guys showed a lot of
character."

Despite not playing a superb
game. there were still some good
performances for the Danes.
Leading scorer chaj played
another unselfish game. “Afrim is a
hard worker. He is undoubtedly an
all-state player. in the last few
games. the pressure for him to score
goals has subsided and he has
beconre an even better player,"
commented the coach.

Scrgovich also played a good
game. in spite of being one of the
slower runners on the Danes, he has
been an asset.

Schiet'felin noted that the team is
very balanced and he doesn‘t expect
any egos to get in the way of the
team's cohesiveness.

in the latest ranking, Albany was
placed second in New York State
and twelfth in the nation in Division
iii soccer.

The Danes have two crucial mat-
cites approaching on their schedule.
Tomorrow afternoon they will
travel to Schenectady to face Union

Tent City Today 

 

12 SUN Y Schools Expected

by Whitney Gould

Protesters front SUNYA and 12
other state schools will pitch their
tents on the lawn of SUNY Central
today, without the blessings or per-
mission of Chancellor Clifton
Wharton.

SASU, organizer of “Tent Ci-
ty", was rebutted in its efforts to
gain administration authorization
for the event. btrt according to
SASU President Jim Stern. pur-
ticipating in the event “should not
get anyone arrested."

“Tent City" is a result of student
opposition to a $150 board rate in-
crease for schools in the SUNY
system. Students at SUNY colleges

at Potsdam. New Paitz and
Brockport have already held over-
night protests irr front of their
school‘s administration buildings.
in response to SASU’s applica-
tion for a permit to stage the event,
University Counsel Sanford H.
' Levine notified the organizers that
"no temporary structures, tents or
portable sanitary facilities" will be
allowed at the site. Chancellor

Wharton's office instead granted
permission for art “orderly protest "
between the hours. of 9 a.m. and 5
p.m. confined to the headquarter's
sidewalk.

“The University gave rrs a permit

"They seem to care more about the
grass then they do about students."

Stern expects between 100 and
400 protesters from to to l2 state
colleges and universities. He says it
will be unlikely that Wharton will
have students arrested, but that
SUNY’s statements were a tactic to
keep students away. According to

farewell than a carrrpaign plea. Tire
Republican Senator centered on his
accomplishments in higher educa-
tion and the “quality of life“ for
New Yorkers in his address to a
meager crowd of about .150.

.lavits noted tltal he has served in
the Senate longer than arty other
N.Y. Senator — “enough of an
honor for anyone” — and that he is
currently senior member of the
Senate sub-committee on educa-
rion.

Javits enumerated in detail the
progression of such educational
programs as Supplemental Educa-
tiotral Opportunity Grants (SE00).
aid to urban universities. and the
“Student incentive Grant Pro-
gram." Javits added that "the
latest edtrcatiortal bill increased the
amount available in loans by $7.500
for undergraduates and $15,000 for
graduate students."

Tire Senator commented on his
involvement with programs for
New York State, noting that he is
the author of Ci'i’i‘A, an employ~
ment program which mandates "a
certain quotient of public jobs."
.lavits also discussed social security
anti pension programs. alluding to a
1975 law that guarantees pension
payment by the federal govern»
nrerrt.

"it's difficult to live only on
social security," he said. “. . . we
have a long way to go in private

off social security."

Javits proposed to “make it
possible fora farrrily to save $1.000
per year to invest irt a private perr-
sion plan."

The Senator also expressed his
support of a national health plan.
adding that "some urgeneies may
precede (llte plan), including the
need to supply the necessary per-
sonnel and to help hospitals in
highly depressed areas."

Javits said finally that he hoped
the students “wouldn't ttrrn their
backs on politics.

"l urgc students without regard
to party or candidate to participate
in politics for two reasons," be con—
lirtued. “i-‘irstly. it's fun, You meet
the most interesting people through
politics. Secondly, because of
responsibility. As we get to the
more complex. politics becomes an
essential element."

Although the press has been
predicting tirar due to a lack ofhotlt
money and party support Javits will
eventrraliy drop out of the race, the
Senator maintained that he is rtot
giving rrp the fight.

“My problem is money and. l
have a real problem," he said.
"After all these years. i shouldn‘t
have to run a campaign by catching
rides on the Thruway." The
Senator asked, however, “to watch
Holt/.man (the Democratic
nominee) and myself.“ Javits add-
ed that he feels his advantage is in
that he “is the incumbent and has
an extraordinary record.

“Tire problem is that i am not on
the ballot of a major party," he
said.

election. that “D'Amato may he a
