SUNY Fall Enrollment Increases

 

The State Had Expected a Decline

by Nora Kirby

SUNY enrollment this fall is the
second highest it has been, accor-
ding to a report released by Public
Communications Officer for
University Affairs and Develop-
ment Hugh 1. Tuohcy. in addition,
undergraduate enrollment has
reached its highest in the 32 years of
SUNY's history.

A total of 197,754 students are
presently enrolled in the 34 SUNY
campuses. This figure is topped on-
ly by the I975 SUNY enrollment of
200,999 students, according to the
report.

Undergraduate enrollment at
SUNY this year. according to the
report. is “54,318 as compared to
the 1979 enrollment of 157,735

students. In spite of this enrollment
increase. Governor Hugh L. Carey
proposed a major budget cut for
SUNY last April based on expected
declines in enrollment. The state
legislature later rcstored those
funds.

Citing data from the Executive
Bridget, Vice Chancellor for
Finance and Business Hurry
Spindler said Carey wanted a $l2.3
million budget cut as “part of the
plan to reduce state government
throughout, including the Universi-
ty." Carey also requested a cut of
$14 million in view or "changed
economy and curollmcnts."

SASU president .lim Stern
believes it is “a misconception"
that enrollment will decline bccausc

“SUNY is the only affordable place
to go to school.“

Stern also said that as part-time
and minority enrollment increases,
so will SUNY enrollment.

“For the Board of Regents or the
Governor to say SUNY is losing
enrollment is dictating more than
prophesizing." Stern said.

An article in the Albany Times
Union reports that SUNY
Chancellor Clifton R. Wharton Jr.
said. “This fall‘s experience cer-
tainly emphasizes‘ the fallacy of
premature assumptions of dramatic
student body declines."

However. Wharton also stated in
the article that enrollments could be
expected to show some downturn in
the future.

l‘cslival Saturday at the Empire
State Plaza in Albany.

The musical extravaganza was
the brain-child of Gov. Hugh Carey
and. according to Office of General
Services Commissioner John Egan.
should cost the state about
$200,000.

“The major performers have all
douutcd their services," Egan ex-
plnittcd Thursday.

Those major performers will in»

“ill be officially opened at about
11:30 n.1n. with a l‘)—gun salutc by
National Guard howit/crs.

Music. craft demonstrations and
movies will be on display
throughout the day. And there are
reports that Corey has been asde

ficial song. “I Love New York.“

The day’s festivities will end with
a hugc fireworks display beginning
about 7:30 pm.

As revelers leave the giant state
office complex they will see a tower-
ing G-Clcf symbol outlined on the
side of the Towcr Building at the
plaza. The symbol will be produced
by lighting only certain sections of
different ﬂoors on the building.

While the fcstival is considered a
mussch undertaking by state of-
l'icials, it was arranged for in aboul
a anllllt.

“We knew the governor wanted
to do something." Egan said, “but
it wasn't until four or five weeks
ago that we found out exactly what
it was.“

To deal with the large number of
spectators expected for the event,
officials have established a shuttle
bus system to outlying parking lots.
