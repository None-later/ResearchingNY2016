SYA ’3 Made Accessible For Handicapped

by Beth Cttmmantta

The ramps aren't for
skateboards, the wide doorways
aren’t to solve the problem of who
goes througlt ﬁrst; and the dotted
and raised lettered selection labels
on some campus vending machines
aren’t for decoration. They're all
adaptation for disabled people at
SUNYA.

; News FEATURE

Since the Rehabilitation Act of
I973, and Sections 503 and 504
(I978) mandating architectural and
programmatic accessibility for all
organizations receiving $2500 or
more front the federal government,
SUNYA has been altzring
sidewalks, buildings and stairways,
artd relocating classes to meet the
needs of its disabled.

According to Assistant Dean for
Student Affairs, Nartcy lIclowich,
wlto works with disabled sttrdcrtl
s'crvic ,SUNYA was not btrilt willt
accessibility irt mind because "the
consciousness wasn't really tltcrc."
Prior to 1973, you just didn‘t see a
lot ol ltarttlicappcd pcoplc
artywltcrc. Why‘.l 'l‘lrcrc was no ar~
cltilcctural acccssihility artd there
were rto civil rights for the disabl-
cd."

Wltcrt tltcsc laws were passed,

take millions." Since there were
and still are few federal funds to
help organizations make these

adaptations. she said, SUNVYA has ‘

made as many adaptations as it can
with the money available.
' “If, for example, the graduate
program you get accepted into is on
the second floor, and there is no
elevator. the program has got to get
to you," she said, “so, we would
move the program to accomodate
the disabled students." ‘

"The disabled have ..bcen

memorial." Belowich said. "All we
are trying to do is give them equal
opportunity." - ,
Archtectural accessibility extends
to the dorms as well as the academic
buildings. Modiﬁed student hous-
ing is available in four of the State
Quad low rises and one suite on
Dutch Quad. The doors are wider,
the showers are adapted to accom-
modate wheelchairs, and. as Mike
McNichol pointed out to me, the
phones and light switches are lower
than those in unadaptcd rooms. '
MikeI a sophomore from Rome,
New York, is wheelchair bound.
“1 really don‘t have too many
problems. 'course I don‘t look for
them," he grinned. “People arc
pretty nice, holding doors for you
and stuff. My suitemates help me

’ all the time."

Although Mlkc admitted tltat get-'
ting around in rain andsnow cart bc
a problent, he chose SUNYA
because of its accessibility.

Mike has to be good with rt
wheelchair, though —— ltc‘s on tltc
SUNYA-sportsorcd Wheelchair
Basketball tcttttt.

Charlotte Rohcrlsort lives dowrt
‘tltc hall from Mikc. Charlotte, a
sccortd-scntcstcr soltpomotc from
-‘Nasstttt majoring in sociology, is
also irt a wheelchair. She‘s bcctt in-
volved itt civil rights for lltc hatt-
dicappcd for several years.

"Eight or nine years ago. I was

involved with Wheels For In-

dependence. Ten years ago, people.

felt that the handicapped and
disabled should be shut 'away.
Wheels For Independence and
another organization called Indoor
Sports both started getting people
out of their homes, to meetings,
churches, and other activities,” she
said.

She feels that many people don‘t
concern themselves with rights for
the disabled because they think "it‘s
always somebody clsc's problem —
it couldn't happen to me. Adapta-
tions are okay by most people.
“unless they’re inconvenienced.”
Tltcn it's a different story, she said.

Sltc agree with Mike that her big-
gcst problem was getting around in
tltc srtow. “You can‘t get to class
sornctirrtcs." she said. The
sidewalks and ramps arc plowed so
tltcy‘rc clcrtr, sltc said. but. in plow-
ing ortc. the other is often blocked
off, as when a strcct plow blocks
ol‘l~ a dr'itcwuy. “You’re going
along line, artd when you come to
this" sltc raiscd ltcr hands to in-
dicalc the top of the imaginary
snow “and your rulcndanl turns
you around and ltcrtds hack for lltc
dorm," sltc said.

Sltc has an atlcttdattl twcrtly
hours rt wcck to lrclp ltcr' otrt with
“a multitude of things," sltc said.

Coordinator for Rehabilitative
Services in the SUNYA library. Jim
Lane, said-the Learning Resource
Center (LRC) provides a range at
materials to the disabledincludlng a
braille dictionary, is large. print
thesaurus, Talking Books and large
print textbooks.

For example, the library carries a
73-volume Webster’s Student Dic-
tionary, “the World Book Err-
cyelopedia, Roget's Thesaurus, an(
the Columbia-Viking Desk Eng
cyclopedia. Newsweek comes ir
disc form, and catalogues of Recor‘
dings for the Blind are available
Students can call' the N.Y.S
Library for the Blind and Visually
Handicapped and request copies or
materials, which will be provider
to them at no charge."

He added that the books art
usually lertt for extended periods ot
time. since many are used fer
courses.

The library has a Talking Booi
machine to play discs on. listenint
booths for students’ use, and room:
and equipment to be used by
readers to record material.

The Disabled Studcttts Services
according to Bclowiclt, also pool
resources with other local organize
lions. "Wc'rc tied lit with a lot 0
local groups and try to sharc cxpcr
tisc, l‘ricrtdsltip, and resources," It '
said.

Willt scrvicc constantly improv
ing, the disablcd's biggest hartdica
now is other people‘s attitudes, slt
said. “Your! avcr'agc disablcd per
son feels like ‘I cart do anything.
Otltcr pcoplc, wltctltcr tltey‘rt
afraid or unaware, are often a ltin
drartcc."

“Matty disabled pcoplc call u
TAIIs," sltc said. “Tcntporaril

others. that's all.
