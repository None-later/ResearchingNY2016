High Tides Forever V

Watcrbcds have gained a reputa-
tion for many things and now an
agricultural ncwslcttcr reports yet
another use of thc watery mat-
trcsscs.

California Farmer says that in
Northern California, pot growcrs
have started using watcrbcds as ir-
rigation reservoirs for the drip ir-
rigation systems used to water their
marijuana crops.

 

Just think, you could relax on a
watcrbcd and watch your crops
grow at the same titnc.

Marijuana growing irt Northern
California. according to official
state reports, is a hurrdrcd-rrrillion-
dollar business.

California Far/trur rcporlcd no
figures on wltcthcr watcrbctl sales
have been affected by the pot grow-
ing hoorn.

Politics And Pot

thrc do thc lllt‘cc presidential
cuttditlalcs stand on lltc issuc of

,.,_,,,...

dccriminalizcd marijuana?

A report from the National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws (NORML) reveals
that President Carter has been silent
on the pot issue in the 1980 cam-
paign. in sharp contrast to I976.
when Carter supported
dccrirninalization. Since being
elected four years ago, Carter has
supported the spraying of paraquat
on Mexican marijuana fields.
NORML suggests that part of
Carter’s reluctance to strongly
favor marijuana reform this time

around could be related to reports'

that top White House aides have
been linked to cocaine and other
drug abuse. charges that are prov-
ing to be a political liability for tire
president.

Ronald Reagan, in the meantime,
is very clcar in his bclicf that pot
should remain a serious criminal of-
l'cnsc. The Republican candidalc
has callctl marijuana — in his words
— "the nation's most dangerous
drug." erilc governor of Califor-
nia, Reagan vctocd scvcrul bills that
would have looscrtcd up penalties
l'or thr: simple possession of rnari-
jtrzrna.

Albany Student Press (-

John Anderson is the only major
presidential candidate to openly cn-
dorsc the dccrlminalizatian of mari-
juana during this campaign.
However. his liberal view seems to
bc a recently acquired one: during
his tenure in the House of
Representatives, Anderson did not
once co-sponsor any of the many,
dccriminalizatirtn bills that were in--
troduced in Congress.

Cigarctlc companies may be dup-
ing the smoking public when they
claim that the levels of tar and
nicotine in cigarettes have been
declining in recent years.

Three scientific researchers
report that the tobacco companies
are using a "loophole" in their
lcsling procedures to rnakc it up-
pcar that tar and nicotine levels are
dropping. That loophole, according
to thc scientists, involves ilrc way
