Six or seven people had gathered

powerful chopper blades sprayed water
in our faces as the troopers yelled to

Ralph Stiles elaborated.

"He set there in the gazebo wrtlr his
girlfriend and said For gonna birild my house
here. He had $20M“ on his person and used
that as a down payment." Ralph told us.
There were two hotels on the properly at
that time. George 0. Knapp built his house.
and the family continued to buy land until
the estate covered over llifltl acres. i i
eluding 10 miles of waterfront.

Elsa Steinbar:k. author of several books on
the. area. has spent every one of her suin-
liters at Shelving Rock. She was present.
and added the details

The house. built in 1000. was huge. she
recalled, and was built into the cliffs. It had a

claimed. as he stood shivering on the
bank next to Ralph's house. The other
were quivering. too. as they changed
into dry fatigues.

Regrouping. the men excitedly ex-
changed stories of the exercrse thus far.

“When you parachute," one explain»
ed to us. “you're just held in by a
harness. You have to undo your gear
on the descent. and then shed the
harness before you hit the water. From

  

there it's free-fall."

One trooper lost his boots. another
his flippers.

“The water jump is the harriest one
you can make." Dari Burke of West
Winfield. NY. said.

As the troopers changed. we got
reactions from some of the observers.

“l \vouldn't miss it for the world!"

look at this for patriotism." she staun-
chly Claimed.

Lisa Knapp thought it was fun to
watch. but her friend Bill Campbell was
more critical.

“Are they doing it for publicity?" i
asked him.

“Sure,” he answered. confidently.

“They aren't trying to keep it a secret.
it's a good political thing to see assault
groups climb a mountain. especially
after the situation in Iran." he said.

. By the way. how did he feel about
Carter's handling of the hostage rescue
attempt?

"Pathetic." he groaned.

Ralph had his own story to tell

“My father Worked for ‘().|.' (George 0.
Knapp ll." he said. “We moved out here in
l‘llltr, when l was 13 years old. There were
seven families on the estate their. and we
had our own school.

 

“There’s only
three ways out
of here in the
winter: Take the
road, 90 across
the ice, or stay
here until spr-
ingtime."

lln one can, crackers and "Candy,

lchocolate disk with toffee. . .Type Vlf,
"Style 3," in another. _

‘ “Try this," one said as he tossed over
a heavy little can.

"Chocolate Nut Roll,” it read. Well,
anything tastes good when you're
hungry.

They were still shivering; it was brisk
and no sun aided in warming their
goose ptmpled skin. As Burke showed
me some of " 0 iii runtatneering equip-
ment. he e; ,. :d )U t who these men
were.

They are all civitra living in the
New England area, members of Corn-
pany A. a reserve unit from Fort
Devons. Mass. One weekend per
month they are paid to plan and ex-
ecute training exercises.

“We're highly specialized. but much
more informal than the regular. full time
Special Forces." he explained.

“Our main function. during wartime.
would be to jump behind lines and get
partisans banded together."

in regard to the exercises. Burke said.
"We know it's a game. but we get intr
the game. We can be animals if we have
to." he asserted. with a glare in his eye.

The purpose of the exercise. Burke
admitted. is. in part. to drum up publici»
ty.

“if the units don't do anything." he
explained. “they won‘t get any
recruits."

“Why do men enjoy the exercises?
Why do they enjoy combat?"

"We get to go out and do things."
was the consensus. "We have a lot of
control over what we do."

“it (combat) is risky," Burke said. “but
we enjoy it."

After thinking a moment he added.
“And when you're scared shitless. you
live Closer to reality."

This challenge. this satisfying thrill of
risk and danger. seems to be the
underlying psyche that keeps these men
together.

Helicopter pilot Philip lde. a former
pilot in Vietnam and Korea. and now a
captain in the Army National Guard.
confirmed our theory. He has seen a lot
of action, he said. both active and
simulated as in these exercises, and he
has come to one conclusion as to why
these men do it.

"They love it! They eat it up!"

“My father and his brother were caretakers
of the estate and engineers on the yacht.
"l owned a farm in Fort Ann. Then my
father was gettin' old and he offered me the
job. 1 been caretaker since '72." he said.
"Now I work for ‘O. Ill." be continued.
The estate covers only 75 acres now. but still
supports three houses and includes the face
of the cliffs.

“The family comes here in summer, and
soinetiiires iii the fall for ‘colours'." Ralph
said.

"But I'm just an old hermit in the winter-
time." he aughed.

"They (the town) plow the road when it
snows, but I tell 'em not to plow it too low so
I can get around by snowmobile.” he ex-
plained I know every crack and crevice in
this mountain here. and I can ride you 75
miles without doubling hack. '

“There's only three ways to get out in
winter," he said later. "Take the road. go
across the ice, or stay here uritll springtime."
He decided to conclude.

“Yep. the Stiles family and the Knapp
family has been together since they come
here," he said.

“Hi be here until i retire.”

 

He smiled.
