tiott for over a ycar now. This pitiblcin
came to my attcntion through my bust
friend who attends tltc University. Shc has
told inc on many occrtssions of tltc attacks,
including rape. that have been occurring iii
tltc area in which she lives.

1 have learned that within tltc Inst yciir
approximately ﬁfty fivc attacks on young
women have occurred by this one nttui. or
possibly more than onc, known lo the
police as the Pine Hills Molcstct'. i am vcry
concerned about tltc safety of my fricitd
and i worry constantly about iicr and othct
friends of mine who also attend Albany

    

area of attack is always the same. l've been
told by my friend that the uniformed
policemen patrol the area in police cars
and usually sit at street corners in tltcir cusi-
Iy recognized patrol cars with their lights
on. Now doesn’t that scent a little bit
ridiculous to you? Since this ntolcstcr has
bcctt running around for over a ycar now.
and is obviously very clever, i would think
that tltc police would have ti little more
