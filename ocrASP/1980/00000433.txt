The Union has filed a suit with

Board. charging Quadrini with
failure to negotiate in good faith.
The workers blame Quadrini for
unproductive talks and a reluctance
to negotiate. Quadrini ltad failed to
even recognize the union during the
early Weeks of the strike.

McClellan said that when UUP
joined forces last week, the morale
of the strikers had hit
“rock-bottom." and that the strike
sccmcd about to fold. He added he
hoped that when the four or ﬁve
prof'cssors joined the pickets. the
morale of the strikers had lifted.
