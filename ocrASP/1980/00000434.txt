Neimen Fail In Bid For Undefeated Season

by Larry Kuhn

The Albany State men’s tennis
team stormed onto tltc courts at the
University of Massachusetts on
Wednesday with a perfect 5-0
record looking for their first
undefeated season in five years.
They came up short as they were
ouidueled by an experienced
Massachusetts squad, 6-3.

It was a very tough match bet-
ween two cvcnly matched teams,
but somehow Massachtisctts came
out on top in five of six siti'glgs-mat-
cites to clinch. _ -

“We're practically equal —— the
match could have gone eitltcr way,"
said Albany tennis coach hob
Lewis. "They were just more men-
tally tough in the third sets. They
wanted it a little tttorc tltait we did.
We have no excuses."

In the top singles match,
Albany‘s Barry Levine (4-2 itt dual
matches) lust to Neil MacKeniit-h,
6-2. 7-5. "Levine played very ten,
tatively. He didn't play as well as he
can,” noted Lewis.

Fred (iaber (4-2) played at
number ttvo arid was defeated by
Sergio Strepntan iii a tough three»
setter. 4-6, 6-0, 6-3. (latter was

hampered by a shoulder injury
which made it difficult to serve, in
addition to "coming up against a
very tough competitor in Strep-
man," according to Lewis.

In third singles. freshman Rob

Karen (6-0) remained the hottest
player in the Albany lineup as he
pulled out their lone singles win
over Marc Huettman. 6-2, 1-6. 6—4.
“Karen gave a real gutty perfor-
mance." said Lewis. “He was down

3-0 in the third set and came back to
win."

Davelerich (3-1) played 'well ear-
ly in his matchI but was tagged with
his first loss by Matt Modlish, 3-6.

Andy Diamond (2-3). 6-1, 6—0, in
the easiest match of the day.

in sixth singles Dave Lerner (4-2)
battled Paul Jaft‘er, but came 'out
on the short side,- 5-7, 6-4, 6-2.
“Lerner in defeat played one ofthe
best matches i've ever seen him
play. He's starting to come along
very well," said Lewis.

Albany took two out of the three
doubles matches. but it was anti-
climactic. Levine and Gaber paired
to edge MacKentich and Modlish,
8-6. in a pro-set match. Karen and
Ulrich were nipped by Huettman
and Mike Harrelson. 8-7, but Dia-
mond and Lerner finished the
match with a win over Craig Turner
and Steve Jordan. 8-4. '

The Danes' season winds down
today and tomorrow as they defend
their championship in the
SUNYAC tournament and Lewis
ltas ltigli hopes.

We‘ll definitely be in the top
three," he said. “it's goiitg to be a
real battle between Binghantton,
()neoitta, attd Albany. The draw
will be a factor iit who wins.“

Lewis feels that the team can win
the 10 teant tournament without
winning many individual cham-
pionships. “Our best bet for a
championship is Karen at number
three." he said. "We are strong,
but beatable, at one, two. four. and
six, but they should make it to the
finals. Oneonla is very strong at one
and two. and liittgltantiott is strottg
at four. five, six."

Lewis added, “We also ltavc a
good shot at winning doubles at one
attd two. if we cart get sortie points
at number three doubles it will help
our chances greatly."

"This is definitely the highlight
of our season and we want to win it
badly." Lewis said. "i hope
Massachusetts serves as a wake-up
match for us. it showed that we are
beataltle."

the duo of fullback Tittt Najuclt arid
tailback Maik Mitiei. The latter has
356 yards iii 97 carries, artd was
termed by L‘ltaittltliss as "a good
tailback. A shitty rumter with good
speed." N' inch is “a big kid (5»ll.
ZIS). l' ttv powerful," accor-
ding l- . i..uthliss. “it takes a cott-
ple tn people to bring ltiitt down."

The Buffalo offensive litte is
young, with three juniors and two
sophomores starting, artd is an-
chored by center Rich Phillips (also
the kicker). and guards Brian
Wilson and Kevin ()‘Shaughnessy.
“They are probably their better
ballpluyers," Chantbliss noted.

“I suspect that they'll ltave sottte
ntonientunt when we go itt there,"
said Collins. “They were pretty
lucky to win that game (against
Rochester), but that's the kind of
season they‘ve been having."

“When they (Buffalo) go ittto the
game this week, they’ll probably
have the sattte feeling they ltad last
year, but for a different reason --—
they‘re undefeated. And because of
the way we beat them last year,
they‘ll be ready for us," Cltantbliss
concluded.

Karen and Ana
