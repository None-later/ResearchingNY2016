Women Harriers Win One,
Lose Two In Week

by Debbie Kaptnn

’ Last Tuesday. the Albany State
women‘s cross-sountry team lost to
Cortland State. One factor was a
shortage of the necessary number of
runners needed to score team
points. The barriers were deﬁcient
due to a sickness and an ineligibili-
ty. One more runner was excused
due to an academic committmcnt,
leaving Albany one short of the
mandated ﬁve competitors.

Chris Gardner, the number one
Albany runner at this time placed
ﬁrst with a strong time of 18:499.
followed by Nancy Nelson of Cor-
tland State with 19: l9:5. The course
consists of a 5,000 meter distance.
covered by many hills and turns.
Even though Albany was not-table
to score as a team. a problem they
have faced before, the individual
scores count towards the State
Regional Championships.

Albany coach Barbara Palm is

Good newsl '

L1batt'<, Canada's No. i sclling’becr, is now imported to the U. '5.
So, now it's easier to compare the taste of our Labatt's with the

brew of our friendly competitor.
See what you think.

We, like most other Canadians, prefer a bottle of Labatt's 'Bcer

over a Golden,

ll we didn't, wc'd likely be drinking Molson® instead—and we

certainly wouldn’t be running this ad.

pleased with her team's overall per-
formance thus far, citing Satur-
day's win over Union College -—thc
women harriers‘ second victory.

The coach is especially pleased
with the performance of Gardner.
who Palm feels “has a good shot at
making the Ail-Eastern team and
the Nationals."

Palm also stressed her squad's
growing feeling of unity and weekly
improvement. and named Debbie
Sussman and Kim Bloomer as two
people to watch as the season con-
tinues. ‘

Tomorrow, the women barriers
travel to Central Park in Schenec-

J.V. Danes
Drop To 1-3

by Pete Stcln
A fourth quarter rally by the

, Mlddlcbury junior varsity football

team led to a i9-i7 victory over the
Albany JV team last Friday aftcr~
noon. The loss gave the JV Danes a
record at i-J.

The Danes dcl‘cnsc, led by Eric
Newton and Bobby Jojo, played cx-
trcnicly well, despite Middlcbury‘s
touchdown drive in tlic filial period.
Newton's interception at the
Albany onc yard linc sci up an 89
yard touchdown run by Rickey
Miller. which tied the game at 7~7.
Jojo‘s ()7 yard iritcrccplion return in
the third quarter gayc Albany a
l4»l2 lead.

A fumble recovery by the Danes
at the Middlcbury 23 resulted in a
34 yard ficldgoal by Toni Lincoln,
giving the Danes a l7-12 load at the
end of the third quarter.

Meanwhile, the ol'fcnsc was hav—
ing an off day. Other than Miller's
89 yard touchdown run, turnovers
at lhc wrong time in the wrong
place stil‘lcd the jayvcc wishbone.
Two kcy injuries to tlrc Albany
quarterbacks l'orccd coach Eru
Chambliss to substitute liali'backs
in the quarterback slot.

Today the Danes wrli face
Wcstclrcslcr Community College at
3:00 on University field.

Morales at lcftwing.

“Morales did a heck of a job. He
might only bc 5-]. but he played
like he was seven foot tall. He will
definitely start in the next game
against Potsdam.” nolcd the coach.

Following the Potsdam grime
Albany will compete in nnotlrcr key
contest against SUNYAC rlvul
liinghamton in a game which could
decide the conference title. A win
here will at worst lcavc Albany in a
tie for first place.

“We playctl really outstanding
today. They showed that they can
score some goals. Three of the four
scores were professional goals. If
we played Onconta today. the only
conl'crcncc garlic we lost, its not a
matter of whether we can beat
them. I know we could beat them."
