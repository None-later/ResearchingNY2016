City Royals strung together_ four
straight hits in the third inning, in-
cluding Willie Wilson's two-run tri-
ple and an RN double by U.L.
Washington. and held on to edge
the New York Yankees 3-2 for a
commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-
five American League Champion-

only 20-game winner, scattered
seven hits before giving way to Dan
Quisenberry, top reliever in the AL

runs they needed in the third before

ed the door.

2-0 deficit in any league champion-
ship series since the current playoff

“Although Leslie played an ex-
ceptional game, anytime you put
the ball in the net three times that's
great. The game was an outstanding
team performance and it's hard to
single out one player for being more
outstanding,” said Schieffclin.

The scoring started at 39:32 of
the opening half. Jerry lsaacs flip-
ped the ball to Severe. The right
halfback dribbled passed one
defender and only had the goalie to
beat. The keeper came out to meet
Severe, but despite being off
balance, ltc fired a shot past the
goalie to put Albany on top l-O.

“Leslie’s goal was not a good
goal — it was a prol‘cssional tally,”
Sclticfl'clin said.

In the game, Albany only had six
shots on goal. a very low number.
Incredibly fottr of these blasts land-
ed iii the goalie cage.

The first half ended with Albany
leading. l-O, but Union quickly
changed this iii the final half.
Alberto Giordano. Albany's poten-
tial All-American goalkeeper, was
watching the action come down the
right side. Union then tried to
penetrate across the rrriddlc. John
Mttrkes was tlterc to cover. but
when he tried to clear the ball, it
found its way into the Albany net to

continued, “while Hartwick coni-
plctely dominated. We only rriade
two good attacks at tltcir goal in the
whole period. Lauricliriggs, ottr
goalie, did a fantastic job with some
really beautiful saves (a total of 23
throughout the game). We were
very lucky that they didn't score in
the second half, and that we went
into overtime."
