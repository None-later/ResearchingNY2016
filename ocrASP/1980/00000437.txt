Second baseman Frank Rivera
simply sat quietly on the bench with
a blank look on his face. Coach
Rick Skeel clutched the dugout rnil-

ing with his hands and looked out at ‘

the‘ ﬁeld with an air of disbelief.
And both men contemplated the
loss just suffered as Siena College
had walked off with a 5—4 victory
over Albany State Wednesday. at
Schenectedy's Central Park.

What made this loss particularly
painful was that Albany, entering
the bottom of the ninth inning was
leading 4—3. But the Indians rallied
for two runs in their ﬁnal turn at
bat to steal away the win from the
Danes. Albany State-Siena con-
frontations are always close strug-
gles and Wednesday's game was no
exception.

“Each time we play them it's
tough." said Skeel.

Sophomore pitcher Ron
Massaroni started for Albany and
held Siena hitters at bay for eight
innings, He allowed only three runs
on eight hits. while striking out
three.

Siena jumped out to a 1-0 lead in
the bottom of the second. as lnditui
Bob Thompson scored on Frank
Ronkcse’s infield baseliit.

Albany came back quickly with
three runs in the top of the third.
Bruce Rowlands supplied the key
hit. slicing a two run triple down the
rightlield linc.

Danes

by Bob Ilellafiore

Rotary Field. home of the
University of Buffalo. has not been
a friendly place for the Albany
State football team. Two years ago,
the Danes marched into Buffalo
with a top ten ranking in Division
Ill and a real shot at post season
play. They trudged off with a 15-8
loss and a bit less than a hope of
any playoff consideration. In 1979.
Albany slightly avenged that defeat
by blasting the Bulls. 40-12.

Massaroni had some trouble in
the bottom half of the third as he
gave up two costly walks to Oppos-
ing pitcher Chuck Sohl and
firstbaseman Chet Smith. Thomp-
son promptly doubled both his
teammates in. With those two runs.
Siena deadlocked the score at 3-3.

“I hurt myself. The innings I
walked batters they scored runs."
said Massaroni.

During the next four frames.
neither team scored. Siena occa-
sionally tagged Massaroni for some
long flies while the Danes could
hardly touch Sohl. except for a cou-
ple of deep pokes by Toni Verde.
Sohl threw hard stuff all night and
only allowed five. Dane hits.

The Indians did threaten in the
seventh. but that was soon erased
when the runner on second. Ken
Hayner was nailed at third by left-
fielder Bob Arcario. trying to tag
tip on Solrl‘s fly out. Finally. in the
top of the eighth inning. Albany
broke the tie. Jerry Rosen scored on
Rowland‘s sacrifice fly. giving
Albany a 4-3 lead.

Massaroni looked solid again iii
the bottom of the eighth retiring the
side itt order. Brit in the bottom of
the ninth, Albany's lltll’dluck t‘atc
manifested itself one more tiriie.

Massarotii yielded a walk to
lcadoff hitter (‘lrris Cletiicns. On
the ircxt play. Httyrrcr bunted.
l-‘icldirrg tltc ball. catcher Verde
elected to try for the lead runner.

retiti'rirn-tii-w' ‘t-Iz'A  - 

Clemens, at secondbase. His rushed
throw was low and skipped out to
centerfield. giving the lndians run-
ners on first and second.

Skeel removed Massaroni and
brought in ace reliever Mike
Esposito to try and put out the late
Siena fire.

"Ron (Massaroni) pitched a
super ballgame. He felt himselfthat
he wanted somebody else to finish
up for him.“ said Skeel.

Having had his complete game
bid spoiled. Massaroni said, "i was
pretty happy with my performance
but I came away unfulfilled."

The next hitter. Sohl bunted one
that bounced over Esposito's glove
and loaded up the bases. Then, on a
sacrifice fly by Smith. Clemens
came into score on a disputed play
at the plate. and the ballgame was
tied 4-4. Thompson, who had four
hits in four plate appearances and
three ribbies. singled. driving in
Hayncr front second to win the
game, 5-4.

“We outplayed them. That play
at the plate could hare gone either
way." said Skeel. “We had tltern
against the ropes."

For the Danes. it was another hit—
ter one-run loss. "We‘re having
such hard tough luck on the road."
concluded Skeel. who now must
look to the remaining conference
garues this season. The Danes, 6-7.
have upcoming doublehcadcrs
against Bitrghanitori and Oswego.

Try To Top .500 Against 5-0 Buffalo

Now, though. Buffalo is
undefeated over their first five
games and ranked 15th in the na-
tion. and the tables are somewhat
turned. Albany is. for all intents
and purposes. our of the playoff
picture -- the two opening losses
did that. Btrt Buffalo could make
themselves a real viable contender
with a convincing victory over the
Danes.

“They’re 5-0. That does an awful
lot for a learn." said Albany head

in «n eurller game against SCSC. (Photo: Steve Essen)

coach Bob l-‘ord. "They've got the
feeling that they can‘t lose."

Granted. Buffalo is 5-0. bttt that
hasn‘t been against top notch coni-
pctitioti. Of their wins. two have
been by six points (over Hobart.
6-0. and Cortland. 20-14). and two
have been by one point (over
Brockport. 14-13. and Grove City
College. 3-2). The Bulls" latest vic»
tory was over Rochester. 9~7. last
Saturday.

They're not the greatest 5-0
learn.“ said Albany coach
Clitriiibliss. "but they got
sortrclrow."

One way that the Bulls have got-
ten there is defense. Buffalo has
yielded a meager 36 points all
season (that's 7.2 points per gairic).
Their 4-4 alignment is iirorc like a
wide-tackle six. That means that irr-
stead of having the outside
linebackers set up off the litre of
scrimmage and outside the ends.
they align inside the ends and on the
line.

“They get right tip in your face
and think they can stick it to you."
Chantbliss said.

The focal area of the Brill
defense. according to Clranibliss, is
the inside linebacker position. marr-
ticd by Scott Deming and Cosmo
Nestola. “They're llrc strong point
of the defense." said Cliatiibliss.
Deming and Nestolit are the ones
that the Dane offense must control
if they are to win. according to
Albany coach Mark Collins. who
scouted Buffalo along with
(,‘lraiiihliss. “Their linebackers
played well for them." Collins said.

The defensive tackle spot for the
Bulls. said Cliuirrbliss. is “not spec-
tacular." One is 6-0. 205 pound

there

lirv .

Mike Rossi. bttt the real concern is
Gary Brown. At (1-0. 270 pounds.
Brown “docs sotiic damage. if
you're running at liiitr. hc‘ll give
you trouble.“ Cliairibliss said.

The ends on defense are big.
quick. and aggressive. Chamin '
said. and will have the duty of keep-
ing tltc Albany hacks from getting
to the sidelines. They will be Jim
(iraiiclielli (6-0. 200 pounds) and
.lolrti White ((1-0. le) pounds).

Buffalo blitzes and shifts fre-
quently on defense. and that causes
the secondary to play irrati—to-iirarr
coverage on tltc receivers. Co~
captaiti Sam Monaco (5-9. lllO
pounds) plays the deep safety spot
and "runs the show. lic's definitely
the leader on defense." Cliarnbliss
said, He will he ﬂanked on either
side of the Bulls basi‘ttlly tlrrcc-
deep secondary by Frank Ber-
rafato and Craig Kolar. "They're
good athletes —— fairly good speed
and liztrd nosed." said Clraiiibliss.

“They’re going to need it little
riiorc quickness against its rntlrct
than strength. 'l‘lrey'll need their
quicker people otrt there."
Cliarirbliss continttcd.

lf Buffalo keeps their from eight
men on the line of scrimmage like
they have so far this year. Albatiy
will resort to the passing game.
“just enough to loosen them up. If
they stay on the line of scrirrriiiagc.
we‘re just going to throw the ball --—
use our quick stuff out of play ac-
tion." suid Clrnrnhliss. “They're
hard hitters and frtirly aggressive."
Cllambliss noted of the Bulls. who
give up a rrriserly 2l4 yards per
grime in total offense. “They have
the potential to play good defense.”

Collins feels that Buffalo’s shif-

  

ting will hurt them on Saturday
because of tltc nature of Albany's
triple option offense. “I see the
stunts giving them problems.” (,‘ol-
liiis said. “You can’t stunt against
the wishbone too oftctt and be suc-
ccssful."

Offctisively. Buffalo hasn‘t had
the ability to score many points, in
five gatires. the Bulls' l-pro and slot
formations have averaged just over
10 points per game. "They get
dowtr iirto scoritrg territory and just
don‘t pirt the ball in." Charrihliss
said. "They are mainly a passing
team. but with a good enough iuirri-
ing game to get by."

The quarterback situation for the
Bulls is similar to Albany's iii that
when the starter isn’t moving the
team. there is a sub that is capable
of taking over. .liirr Rodriguez. at
6-1, 185 pounds. is the primary
signal-caller for Buffalo. but throws
a not-so-spectactrlar 37 percertt.
“l-lc tends to run the ball a lot,"
Chambliss said. He also noted that
a 25 mile per hour wind hampered
their game against Rochester. His
sub is Al Whitehead. who although
being iitorc of a thrower. is only six
for 15 on the year.

Buffalo’s top receiver is flanker
Frank Price. with to catches for 206
yards and one touchdown. Behind
ltirir is speedster (inry Quatrittii.
whose 9.3 second lot) yard dttsli
time makes hint a deep tlit‘ 'rtt at arty
time. He has to receptions for me
yards. birt a neck sprain has tirade
hint questionable for Saturday. He
will be replaced. it“ necessary, by
Joe l.icnta, who also returns prints
and kickoft's.
