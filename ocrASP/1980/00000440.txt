students the right to vote in their
college communities. although
“there have been court crises
(concerning the issue) all through
the '70’5."

Lestcr added that students have
made a political impact throughout
the country because of similar deci-
sions in other states.

Perhaps the greatest impact was
made in Madison. Wisconsin in
I972. when Paul Siogiin. a graduate
student at the University of Wiscon-
sin was elected mayor of Madison.
Madison students had been given
the right to vote in the city only the
year before. Sioglin has served as
mayor since then. and is consider-
ing running for U.S. Senate.

Lestcr noted finally that “the
right to vote is a fundamental right.
preservatch of all other rights.

“Before you can exercise other
rights—«such as dcccnt housing and
police protection—you rnusl first
have the right to vote.“ he said.
