Too Many Misconceptions of Ron

Term—— ySha giro

Before l begin my arguments i would like
to give a word of thanks to Mr. Mike Fitz-
simmons of tire Socialist Workers Party for
one of the remarks made in his column of
Oct. 3. l have been called many things since
i started campaigning for Ronald Reagan.
To be called “eloquent”. especially by so-
meone who is diametrically opposed to
everything l believe in, is gratifying. Thank
you.

Unfortunatly, for all his courtesy, Mr.
Fitzsimmons adheres to a set of political
and economic beliefs. known as Marxism,
which have been discredited botlr
theoretically arid historically. l do not have
space witltitt the confines of this column to
detail the various fallacies of Marxism. in-
terested readers can check the library for
books on this .sttbjeet.

One statement by Mr. Fitzsimntons can
not. ltowcvcr, be overlooked., He stated
that the recertt strike in Poland resttlted itt
support. by tlte workers. for a planned
economy yet was a reactiort against tltc
“Bureacratic-caste tltat runs it." in fact.
this "bureacratic-caste" is ttot an aberra-
tion of the communist system bttt is. in
stead, its core. No communist system has
proved itself able to goverrt witltotrt a
powerful cetttral planning conttttittee
allocating resourses arid directing produc-
tiort in accordance witlt some ittaster plan.
in all instances tltis system has proved to be
a dismal failure. especially irt comparison
With the free market system.

Mr. Jay Cohen, on the other liattd.
althottglt he did not endorse atty candidate,
did present many reasonable argtirnetrts
against Ronald Reagan. Regrelably. Mr.
Cohen's arguments are based on the saute
misconceptions of Govc‘nor' Reagan tltat l
ltave detailed irt the past.

Mr. Cohen claims that Ronald Reagatt
ltas sonte notion of "Manifest Destiny"
that lte wants to foist on the natiott. Frank-
ly. l‘rn rtot sure wltat nty critic means by
this phrase. Manifest Destiny was a policy
adopted by the U.S. itt the last century to
expand our territory front coast to coast.
For over eighty years the only pttblic use of
this phrase has been irt history books. in
reality, the people advocating this sort of
expansionism today are not conservatitcs.
bttt Russians.

Also, Mr. Cohen condesendingly claims
that Governor Reagan's proposals are bas-
ed on Fundamentalist Christianity. He goes
on to say that this religion only appeals to

 

 

“Midwest farmers of the lowest l.Q." This
attitude leads to some interesting conclu-
sions. If i remember my logic correctly we
can construct the following syllogism: if all
Fundamentalist Christians are morons:
And if John Anderson and Jimmy Carter
are Fundamentalist Christians (wlriclt they
are): Then John Anderson and Jimmy
Carter are. . . Maybe he meant something
else.

One other comment on this issue. Try as i
might to ttrrderstartd there are still sortie
liberal attitudes which baffle tne.The liberal
attittrde on religion contains some glaring
inconsistencies. l'or example, when the
Rev. Andrew Young or the Rev. William
Sloane Coffin or the Rev. Jesse Jackson ad—
vocates increased aid to Third World ita-
tions. total withdrawal from Vietnam, arid

formal rccogrtition of the l’.l..(),. this is
evidence of “an incrc:- .4 social conscier cc
among the clergy." But when the H \.
Jerry Falwell calls for a strong national
defense; this is a “danger to the first
amendment and to the separation ol cltttlch
arid state." I wish tltcy would tttakc tip their
minds.

l'hcn tltcre is the argutttent that corner
vtrtives are ("ill-\ttilncll. This seems to
follow front my use of the phrase "all men
should be cncottragcd to dc\e|op to ilrcir
fitll potential." I firtd it hard to believe that
anyone could seriously protest the generic
use of the word “inert.” Perhaps we should
begin capping ottt'scwcrs w itlt “person-hole
covers.” It is also odd to note that wlttlc we
c'cludc “wontcn frottt tltc conscrwrrrtc

simultaneously increasing the defense

the goverrtntcitt is “Printing money to figltt

with a deficit budget the federal printing

the difference. This means that about 60

(me irticrcstitig sidenote on this issue is
that President Carter. sltortly after con—
demtnirtit Kemp-Roth as “highly infla-

do term papers demonstrating how a three

to fiscally sound. In fact. one of tire few

Notes from a Sophomore:

Since classes are scheduled for ding.ch
times on different days, why don't the
buses run at different times on Tuesday atrd
Thursday, as opposed to Mortday. \\’ctlttcs~
day. and Friday. This could alleviate some
of the crowding present at the bus sltrps
downtown thirty minutes before classes.

Waiting on line for dinner for lwcnt‘.
mintttes Sunday night was rather annoying
Since the cafeteria scents to be empty at
4:00, but jam-packed at 6:00. why not
change the Sunday dinner hours ltoitt
4:00-6:00 to 4:30-6:30. This would spread
out the large numbers of people who like to

Reagan and the Republicans. in general.
stand for what this countrv treeds. That is a
strong. effective leader to guide its and once
again make us the great world power we
ortee were.

Mr. Reagan wished to deliver us frorn the
ever tightening grasp of ()PliC by further
developing nuclear power. We lta\c rttrclear
power today. it is being used effectively and
efficiently and cart help ease the control
smaller. inferior countries have over us.
Some parts of our country rely ltca\ily on
nuclear power. Catt we 'alidly tell these
people they cart no longer use it'.’

Other issues which Rortald Reagan ad-
dresses himself to are those of lERA. abor-
tion. increasing defense spending. reinstate-
rireitt of capital punishment. a crackdown
on cornrrutitistn and socialism, and a rep at]
of the 55 mph speed limit. We do itot need a
constitutional amendment iii regard to
equal rights for women. Art arttcttdrttcnt. as
sttclt, would not further the rights of
women. The change tnttst come tlrrottglt tltc

not give equal rights to blacks. Discrimina-

Cohen’s Reactionism

To the liditor:

In his rebuttal (ASP, October .1). .1.
Cohen displayed his own brand ol tcttt'~
tionisrn and lack of insight. Not only
tltrorrgh his implications that Rt 'tlt |7lti~
motes discrimination and nuclear war
(which can only be described as inferences
made our of contest) but in the high
disregard he shows for other vital interest
groups of our nation. I am referring
specifically to lvlt. ('ohcn‘s remark that
Reagan's conservatism “appeals to the
Midwest farmer of only tltc lowest Hi"

I gather that Mr. (,‘ohcn dth not up
ptcciatc the support Reagan lL'vIL'l\L“r in the
Midwest. .lust because Mr. (‘ohcir does not
support Reagan docs itot mean that those

policy and its eflects makes the reason lot

while the cost of living attd irtflatiort have
been on the rise. (Unlike .so many of us,
farmers cannot negotiate it cost of living

volatile market.)

 

 

 

Before Carter. the ASC (Agricitlture
Stabilizing Committee) of each county
would keep track of every farmer attd allow
each to plant a fair arttoutrt. Any loss due to
heat or flooding would be reimbursed. This
controlled the supply of farm goods while
giving the farmers a sense of security.
Under Carter‘s program the farmer can
plant as much as he warns brtt can get Ito
rrtorc than a gmcrntttent-controllcd start—
dar'tl prit. of 5.1.95 no matter what the
market price is. Nor are there arty go\crn-
rtteitt guarantees — naturally a farmer feels
compelled to grow as tttrrclt as ltc cart.

This. coupled with tltc decrease iit de-
mand caused by ('attcr's gtain embargo

business. ('orisidct tltcsc lttcls itr light of a

Don’t Bother Complaining

What a damn shame.

You guessed it—anothet' scolding. But just bear with us a minute.

Three powerful and highly active groups——SASU. SA. and
SU—worked their tails off to bring you some justice. They held a Tent
City. Attd you didn’t even show.

Perhaps soaring dormitory rates do not concern you. Maybe you
live off campus. But when landlords get wind of new dorm fees, your
rent will jtrmp too.

Perhaps closed-door sessions to decide your fate are no big deal. Or
the fact that your housing contracts were violated.

Perhaps these four organizations should relax arid just lay low—trit-
til the student body starts screaming for some action. When and i'.

Our apologies for bitching. We know you‘re busy. Tests, classrw.
studies. parties» your titttc is occupied. But as a result of this
“business.” your rights. your wallets. and your system is corroding.

it just scents to its a damn shame.

Ah! . . . Victory

We finally won some/little. Thanks to combiited. clfectivc efforts.
SUNYA students will now be able to vote iit the Albany /(ittilder|and
districts.

[1 is essential that stridcttls register here. where we live, work, and
sttrdy fora large part of the calendar year. The more w ’ assert otir itt-
tcrests in the local political sphere. the better our representation will
be.

Of course, for ntosl of us. it is too late to register locally for this
cortiiitg lilcction l)ay. But for those who do plan to vote here, the .‘lSP
