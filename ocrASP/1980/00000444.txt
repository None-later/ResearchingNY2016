therefore. didn‘t score as a team.

Albany‘s Chris Gardner took se-
cond place honors with a time of
19:35. "White and Gardner went
neck and neck for the first two
miles. but Chris just couldn‘t keep
it going. She just didn't have any
kick left at the end.“ said Albany
coach Barbara Palm.

“These were not lhcir best times

by far," Palm continued. "The
conditions were not that favorable.
it was cold. the atmosphere was
heavy. and it was raining off and on
all afternoon."

Tlte other Albany runners finish-
ed strongly also with Deb Sussrnan
coming in fifth, Kim Bloomer sixth,
Cindy Cugtiano ninth. and Barbara
Hill rounding out the team with a
thirteenth place finish.

This is only the third year that
women barriers have competed in
the Capitol District Champion-

ships. Three teams (Albany State.
Sicna College, and Union Colregc)
took part in this year's event. This
is Union’s first win while.AIbnny
took the crown the first two years.

The win was especially disappoin-
ting to the Danes as they had
previously beaten Union. 29-27.
earlier this season.

“The women harricrs travel to
Hartwick College on Saturday for
the Hartwiek Invitational and then
come back next week for the
Albany Invite.
