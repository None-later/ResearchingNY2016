Success I in sports is usually

the wins for tire Albany men‘s cross
country team have been few and far
between.

“We pulled a mild surprise Satur-
day. Tlte season has basically been
disappointing from a victory
perspective. We had won the first
four of these events before Sierra
College took the last two.“ com—
rnertted Albairy eoaclt Bob Munsey.

Scott .laines. Albany's top.
distance tnatt. turned iii an cycellent
performance arid finished second
overall. lle tinted ill at 30:4R for the
10.000 meter run.

"I c\pected James to finish
high-top three or four. He looketl
tealh good at the tuidway point,
staying with about si\ tunucr's'.
Since he's a good hill runner I
thought that he had a good chance
for a top placing.“ said Murrscy.

'l‘he tt\t.‘lllll winner of the meet
was lottt Dalton of Sierra. 'l‘he kc)
performance for Albarty was 'l‘odd
Silta who finished twelfth attd l)t|\c
(toldherg who placed right behind
Siha llt thirteenth positiotr. these
two tuttucts helped tlte Danes oter

take Union. 62-63. and RPI. 62-82..

Their placings were good enough to
boost the Danes ahead of Sierra.
who defeated Albany 26-62.

Following Silva and Goldberg for
Albany were Chris Lam and Kim
Katie who finished twentieth and
twenty-first respectively.

“Katie seems to have turned the
corner. We have been working with
his form anti he has been running
more efficiently. This is the first
race lie didn't get beatett at the end.
He actually was able to pass the
three gttys he needed to pass. Sitt-
prisingly he did it on the hills." said
Mtruscy.

The coach was also impressed
with Goldberg. who he said “ran
the best race of his life." of corn se.
Munscy was pleased with James.

"James is going to be \cr) Iitttt'lt
at the SUNY (‘orrl'cteuce Meet this
\tcekcurl. He should bc with thv lop
tlucr- or four runners w hen the race
ends.” Munset said, 'l but coir

fcrcnce mect will be held this Satur-
day on Albany’s home course. It
starts and ends on the baseball field
at 12:00 p.m.

“We’ll be shooting for a sixth
place finish among the 11 teams

Icompeting. On paper we should

wind up about eighth so I'll be over-
joyed with anything better than
that." added Munsey.

Basically there will be no home
course advantage because the Danes
never had a home meet on this
course this season. Therefore the
runners do not know what they are
capable of.

lircdonia is favored to win tlte
competition. They have been the
victors iii the previous two. Albany
is the only team to win the
SUNYAC meet three years in a
l(l\\'.

“We beat Union atrtl Rl’l on the
hills at the (.‘apital Meet. Maybe otrr
hill work is starting to pay olt."
Munsey concluded.

Excellent Pitching Leads To Batmen Sweep

in .lltn Murkrrtsis

l.ast spring. the Albany stare
baseball team lost a doubleheader
to llinghatnton on a cougloruerrr
tion ol cheap hits and unorthodox
plays leading to runs. according to
Albany coach Rick Skeel. After one
inning of play Saturday afternoon
at llinghatnton. the Danes had a
strong feeling of "deer \ir.” lire)
had iust ghen up four runs as up
posing hitters managed to get on
basc irt unconventional fashion.

fortunately for Albany. that first
ittrtrrtg was the only inning itt which
Dane pitclting was not oter'powcr-
irrg. Mike lisposito pitched the first
si\ inrtirtgs anti earned his fifth \ic
tory of the y rat. with Jim Vaughn
relicting him in the seventh. These
two hurler's allowed the runs on on-
Iy seten hits for the game.

When the Albany pitchers can
litttit the oppositiott to five runs.
chances are very good that Albany
will win the contest. This was the
case its the Danes scored 1} times on
l3 base hits. 'l'ltey exploded tor
eight runs in the top hall ol’ the
