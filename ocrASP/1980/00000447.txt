Netmen Successfully Defend SUNYAC Title

by Larry Kahn

Sometimes a team wins because
of one or two great individual ef-
forts, but the most satisfying win is
when everybody pitches in. when
everybody on the team can say,
“Without me we couldn‘t have
done it." That’s the kind of win the
Albany State tennis team put
together‘this weekend when they
capped off their successful fall cant-
paign by edging Bingttamton in the
SUNYAC championships in

    

Rochester.

“it was definitely a team effort."
said Albany tennis coach Bob
Lewis. “Everybody on tlte team
contributed. arid tlterc were some
key matches wltere the gtrys really
came through when tltcy had to."

Albany topped the lO-team field
with 26 points followed by
Bingltamtort with 25. and Oneonta
with 22. “It was definitely a three-
tcam tournament," noted Lewis. as

points. The championship was
Albany's second straight and fourth
in the last sevett years.

The closeness of the tournantcnt
made every match crtrcial.
Remarkably, all six Albany singles
players made it to the semifinals
and only one failed to make it to the
finals. where Albany captured in-
dividual championships at number
two, with Fred Gaber (wlto won at
number four last year). at number
three behind undefeated Rob
Karen. and at number six with Dave
Lerner.

“All of our players did as well or
better titan I expected." said Lewis.
"The only exceptiott tvas at number

He added. “We expected good

tnargin of victory.

The contest w really that
close being that Buffalo’s last score
came with 15 seconds left, bttt it
certainly was tight crtottglt to give

let Buffalo get as clos“ as 24-16 iii
the third qtrarter.

“We just haven't been able to
