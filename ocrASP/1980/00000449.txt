turning shades of purple. crimson.

Grand Union. and Price Chopper
have expanded to twice their nor-
mal size? Well. if you‘re lucky
enough to have been borrt with such
a keen eye for detail. then you‘ve
probably realized that Halloween is
well on its way. bringing with it the
eternal question. “What will I

 

wear?" Your answer will depend
upon iiow resourceful you are. in
other words. “are you creative or

do you have the bucks”? if you’re -

very creative, then you may win
first prize next week without Sperr-
ding more titan a couple of dollars
for some material and maybe a little
makeup. However, if you can‘t
maneuver the scissors and scot-
chtape as well as you thought. then
a little shopping around rnighi be
the answer.

For those who are low on cash.
the best idea might be the Salvation
Army (located on 452 Clinton Ave.)
or the Next To New shop on 419
Madison Ave. Many iicrns rtiii for

of the heat generation to the Old
English cashmere overcoats and
Victorian white pctticoats made of
the finest silks and cottons. prices
could vary from live to fifty dollars.

deals exclusively with Halloween
