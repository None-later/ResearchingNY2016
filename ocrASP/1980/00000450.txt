“How to market oneself is a life-
long skill, it’s important to give
people this know-how rather than
simply giving them a job." main-
tains Alexander.

Making a Case

And marketing oneself is exactly
the aim of JSS. The first step is at-
tending an orientation that outlines
the process of the series. which is a
sequence of seminars that should be
attended in order. Orientation
preceeds a two-hour introduction
to Job Search, which. according to
Alexander, "helps people arrive at
an understanding of their com-
petence — not just by peddling
credentials -— but by explaining that
competence itr terms of achicvc-
merit analysis."

Competency awareness is what
Alexander advocates in 153, where
Ire tells his students that they must
show fulrr‘liona/ abilities to pro-
spective errrploycrs (for instance:
the ability to “organize time. peo-
ple. and resources" and giving stip-
portive evidence of this ability).

titles held in the past.

“Forget titles of the past jobs —

fi/Iit'litili — \vhat yott cart (/0. No
one will hire you for your labels,"
says Alexander. "it‘s competence
that makes the difference. Talking

rebuilding art old car were two
achievements discussed in Mon»

terms ofapplying tlictn to ajob. It's
knowing how to interpret aC-

Alexander asserts.

the lltsl two sessions following
the introduction to .Iob Search are
Seminar l and II (both given twice
weekly). they involve a systcrrratic
look at past experience.

“I learned this approach from
