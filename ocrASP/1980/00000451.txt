Robert Randall — the first

failure to supply federally grown
pot to states which have legali/ed it
for medical purposes is “art

to avoid dispettsing pot.

Since 1978. 24 states have passed
liberalized pot laws wlriclt wottld
allow them to use marijttatta for the

Tltc federal government. which
originally stated that it would supp-

Toxlc Shock

Toxic Shock Syndrome may be
'caused by a back-up of toxin-laden
menstrual blood which is eventually
pushed into the abdominal cavity.

This is according to a team of
doctors from Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston. headed
by Dr. Arlan Fuller.

The dootors are suggesting that
the newly developed super-
absorbent tampons. which have
been linked to toxic shock, com-
pletely block off the vaginal open-
ing unlike older cotton tampons
which were simply inserted into the
vagina without sealing it off. This.
the researchers say. then causes tox-
ic bacteria to flourish.

According to Fuller and his col-
leagues. this eomplete blocking off
of tire vagina may then cause the
toxinsladett menstrual blood to
back up through tlte fallopian tubes
and ittto the peritoneal cavity.

Once iii the abdominal cavity. the
doctors suggest. tltc toxin is rapidly
absorbed and trattstnitted
throughout the body causing Toxic
Shock Syndrome.

Census Change.

The head of the U.S. Census
Bureau is predicting that the nation-
wide citi/crr count taken this year
will have a profound influence on
society for years to come because it
will reflect a "dramatic change“ iii
the lifestyles of women over the last
ten years.

Census Bureau Director \""tcerrt
Barraba says that in I970. most
women said they were homemakers.
Today. however. he says. ltalf of all
women — arid prt-ltrtbly two thirds
of all women irt their 20's and 30's
— are itt the labor force. As a
result, Barraba says this will show
up on the certsrt~ .r~ a dramatic
change it) the war «actcty is struc—
turcd.

 

Barraba says the effects of the
change in women’s lifestyles will be
felt in sttclt diverse areas as the
types of dwellings that will be built
for people iii the 2lst century to the
types of political alignments itt na-

tional government.

For instance, llarraba says that
because of the change itt women’s
lifestyles. fewer and fewer fantin
dwellings are needed. Asa result. ltc
Predicts architects ttrtd city
designers will probably choose to
build smaller selllsttfficicrtl units
for singles and childless couples in
tltc future.
