stardust '
Memories

continued from page 7::

beginning to wear thin. Beginning ’with An.
nie Hall Allen he reversed the process; the
jokes grew oirt of the material, they rang
truer. and consequently were just as funny.
but in a more rewarding way.

More than anything else. Stardust
Memories is about guilt. Sandy Bates feels
guilty that In a world full of human suffering
all he does is make films. His guilt Is doubled
because the only way he has to express his
frustration is to make a film about It. He also
feels guilty that he gets so much money for
something he thinks is'so trivial. At one point
Sandy runs Into someone he grew up with
— his friend Is awed and Intimidated (he
keeps asking If Sandy remembers him). Sanv
dy tries to console him by saying that this is
merely a society that puts a premium on
jokes. "If I were a Hindu" he says “I’d be
nothing." but neither he nor his friend are
convinced.

But Sandy Bates Is guilty about more than
just his celebrity status. Dorrie. the love of his
life. Is in and out of insane asylums. and his
infatuation with her make any other relation-
ships impossible (we're never told why he
doesn't stay with her. but I resent the Im»
plicatlon that no man should be expected to
stay with a woman who is mentally disturb-
ed; he may just be using his "love" for Dorrie
as an excuse to avoid other women). Allen's
"serious" work has been marked by this kind}

 

the time of Love and Death. the formula was .

of obsessive love for one women — a lave
that cripples his ability to live his life.

Dorrie fits the same mold as Annie and
Mary Wilkle (the Diane Keaton character In
Manhattan) u— neurotic. insecure and up-
tight — the difference lies In the fact that
Allen Is finally taking this kind of woman
seriously. Annie'and Mary were the subject
of affectionate. yet pointed laughs. There is
only one joke made about Dorrie.'that she's
only good two days a month, and that the
rest of the time she's out of it; but each'tlm'e
we hear this. it leaves more of an after taste
because we see how pathetic she really is.
Isobel. on the other band. is the sweet
domestic, complete with two children and a
French accent. Sh is an idealized version of
the simple virtues Sandy thinks he should ac-
cept. but can't —« he continually goes back to
Dorrle’s dangerous hedonlsm. Jessica
Harper has what was very obviously intend-
ed to be the Diane Keaton role. complete
with Annie Hall glasses and a hometown in
Winetka. Ohio. The part is suprisingly weak
and underdeveloped. She is the girl Sandy
attempts to Eliza Doolittle. but her purpose in
the film is rather vague.

Another of the film's unexpected
weaknesses is the acting. The characters
here are more symbolic than usual. which
severly limits the actors, Marie-Christine Bar-
rault. a gifted French actress. best known for
Cousin. Cousirre, has little to do as lsobel.
Part of what makes her desirable to Sandy
is the quiet sanity of her life. This is nice. but
it doesn't give Barrault any acting opportuni-
ty. which Is unfortunate. Jessica Harper is
adequate with it nothing part. The real acting
surprise is Charlotte Ranipling. an actress
who has been truly awful in a series of truly
awful films throughout the seventies.

However. In the wake of her absolutely
brilliant performance here as Dorrie. her past
must not only forgiven, but erased from
memory. Allen Is able to draw out the
tragedy behind her classic. willowy beauty;
she has the eloquent, romantic sadness of a
Fitzgerald heroine. The episode where San-
dy goes to visit her at the asylum is quite
possibly the best single scene Allen has ever
done. and Rampltng fills it with dazzling In-
tensity.

.Allen himself appears more self-conscious

than usual «-— he seems to be trying to act
anguished rather than just act his part. and
the result is uneven. The supporting cast is
quite good, especially Anne DeSalvo as
Sandy's sister.

The problem with films like Stardust
Memories Is that they are full of self-pity.
We're expected to feel sorry for the poor.
pressured artist who just isn't sure if he's do-
ing anything important. The problems of
these men are Interesting. but hardly as
earth-shattering as they seem to believe.
Allen Is at least aware that this problem exists
— at one point one of the moguls complains
about directors who try to “document their
own suffering and fob It off as an." and his
hunlor helps to lighten the load. Gordon
Willis' photography is gorgeous. and visually
this is Allen's best film.

i like Stardust Memories. and l like it a lot,
but I think there are a lot of things wrong with
it. Woody seems to know it too. in the final
scene Sandy looks up at an empty screen
and walks away dissatisfied. whether with
the film or his life we don't know. but it's
clear he has something to say and hasn't yet
found a way to ’lo it. All we're left with at the
end is the promise of more films and that

reﬂects but reinforces attitudes. For exam-
ple. children‘s textbooks which use
"mother and father" in their typical roles
as housewife and brcadwinncr have a great
effect on maintaining those roles as they
are. just as the use of derogatory language
when referring to blacks perpetuates
stereotypes many people are fighting
against. Part of raising onc's consciousness
is realizing how powerful an effect language
can have.

So, believe it. Mr. Shapiro. there are
plenty of people who take this seriously,
and who will not support you or your can»

Happy 30 Year Rip-oft

UAS is currently celebrating its 30th anniversary by offering

the student body “super discounts” on merchandise. Sounds

good. doesn’t it?

Go on and check it out in their advertisements in current

ASP‘s. The service will give you a whopping 30 cents off a lousy

meal. or a free medium point pen when you lose $3 or more from

purchasing goods in the Bookstore. Big Deal!

While we’re pleased to see that they celebrate —- we can’t! Only

a campus of masochistic consumers would find joy in getting

ripped-off for thirty years.

Now the ASP isn’t quick to denounce our own advertisers, but

when the services involved fail to make a fair deal, we feel we can
make an exception.

For instance, you can purchase a hero of equal weight and
substance at a local sub shop for much less than in the Rat. The
difference in quality, of course. leaves little debate.

And if you happen to be on the Campus Center dinner plan,
UAS provides you with a generous $1.80 toward your supper.
Two bucks couldn‘t even get you a turkey sandwich — never
mind a drink.

We won’t even waste your time discussing the beauty of our
Bookstore ~— the student body knows too well how this monopo—
ly of services continues to clip their butts. (Remember that sit-in
last y ‘ili' which lowered prices? Well, our bu: is have turned and
they’ve risen again.)

The list goes on.

Thanks for the free pen, UAS. And for the 30 cents off my
sandwich, too. But it might be just as well if you kept your
coupons.

We’re waiting for genuine efforts to make life more affordable
for low to middle income. public university students. And then
we’ll celebrate too.
