Albany Student Press

by Eric Gruber

In a recent issue of the Potsdam
student paper, Albany State's varsi-
ty women’s tennis team was refer-
red to as the fourth ranked team in
Division III. Albany coach Peggy
Mann figures that her team is more

I like eighth. But against the RPI

women's tennis team, the women
nctters played like they were
number one. as they beat the
Engineers 7-0, last Tuesday.

The Danc‘s number one singles
player. Nancy Light. returned to
her unbeatable form as she beat An-
dra Weisberg, 6-4, 6-2.

This was an especially satisfying
victory for Light. Her opponent
was one oi” the best players in RPI
IIISlt’y. "This match gave Nancy
her conﬁdence back. Her strokes
are much better — her backhand
especially. She shouldn't have any
more troubles this year." corti—
meiited Mann.

In the number two spot was .loaii
Phillips, wlto simply overpowered
her opponent, Betsy Ritati, (i-l. (i-Z.

Albany‘s number three player.
lzlise Solomon, usually the last one
off the court. was first to finish
Tuesday. as she blasted Rl’l's l’er-
binn lidmimtls, (i-O. (r-().

In the fourth seed match, RPI’s
Heidi Schmidt ran into the Dane's
much stronger Laura lsancs, and
lost. 6-2. 6-0.

Sandra Borelle, in the closest
match of the day, had to play
through two tie-breakers to beat
Cathy Sewell, 6-1. 7-6. 12-10.

"Sandra loses her concentra-
tion," Mann said, “But I knew she
could pull this one out."

Things went just as well in
doubles. The number one pair of
Pant Duchin and Sue Bard beat
RPI‘s Siam Goeland and Sandy
Godlick.

Mann is preparing Duchin and
Bard for the state tournament at
Rochester. “There two play very
well together. They are strong and
smart. They should do very well at
Rochester."

In the numbet two double
match. the duo of Chris Rodgers
and Amy I'l'lltlu‘t‘g got off to a
slinky start. but ptit it all together to
defeat Laura Sohrole and Debra
Mcissner. 7-5. 0-2.

Mann feels that the scores were
not really refleer e of the caliber of
play. "We had to work for those
wins. we did not walk away with
them. II was a tough match," Mann

said.

Next Friday, six players will
journey to Rochester for the New
York State invitational Tourna-
merit.

In 1970. Mann organized this
tournament and Il teams arrived.
This year 44 schools from all three
divisions will be participating. “We
now have over 77 entrants,"
boasted Mann.

Light and Cari Solomon will play
singles. Duchin and Bard are the
first doubles pair, with Phillips and
Elise Solomon as the other duo.

Reviewing her selections, Marin is
conﬁdent that she has "a very
strong group going to Rochester."

Light and Cari Solomon have
played a number of very close single
set matches, that have all gone to tie
breakers. While Light remains vic-
torious. Solomon has been playing
very well. Mann feels that both girls
have benefited from such practice.

As for doubles, Duchin and Ilard
have played well together iii the
past. It is the combination of
"liillips and Elise Solomon that ap-
pears to be questionable.

In the past Mann has explained
that singles and doubles are really
quite different in their style of play.
Mann is confident that [Elise
Solomon, usually in singles player.
eaii change.

“She has all the tools. All she has
to do is readjust her game so she
can play with another player. She
and .loan should do very well,"
Mann said.

Marni feels that Albany can bet-
let their 10th place finish out of 41
teams last year. lint in this type of
tournament. where all three divi»
sioiis compete, she sees the urban-
tage lying with schools like Syracuse
and Colgate.

Mann is excited
Rochester toiii iiaiiieiit. She feels the
teams has ils spirits tip and they all
are ready to pit do battle on the
