Keene State Blanks Non-Shooting Albany. 3-0

by Larry Kahn I.

The Albany State men's soccer
team traveled to New Hampshire on
Wednesday where they were
shutout by Keene State. 3—0. The

to 7-3.

in choosing shots. “We're just not

shooting enough. You can’t score if
you don't take shots on goal." said
Albany soccer coach Bill Schieffelin

“We're not hungry enough to get
the ball and take the shot. A high
percentage of our shots go in. but
we have to shoot more," added
assistant coach Charlie Dawson.

Albany's effort was also
hampered by the absence ofstarting
fullbacks Keith Falconer and John
Marks. as well as goalkeeper Alber-
to Giordano. Once again backup
keeper Billy Steffan “did a com-
mendable job," according to
Schicffelin. Albany had seven
freshman starting. and a total of IO
played in the game. At times the in-
experience showed.

The firsl half was scoreless as
neither team could cash in on their
opportunities. Keene State got their
first goal aborit I5 minutes into the
second half when Albany suffered a
defensive Iapsc. leaving a man wide
open downfield.

About It) minutes later. Albany
had their best opportunity of the
day. but their inexperience proved
llleir downfall. Garfield Williams.
recently promoted from tlte junior
varsity squad. had a clear shot witlr

the keeper on the ground. All that
he had to do was chip it over him
for an easy score. but his attempt
failed.

Then came the turning point of
the game. There was a mix-up near
the Albany goal when a Keene State
forward gut tangled with an Albany
defender on the ground. Keene
State scored on the play, but accor-
ding to Schicffelin. it was clearly an
offsides violation. The official rul-
ing was that the forward on the
ground was not involved in the
play. yet he received credit for an
assisl‘on the goal.

“That call turned the game
around." said Dawson. “We had to
put everybody up trying to score —
we had no choice. The referee was a
factor in the game."

,chnc’s final goal was academic
as the game was already out of
reach. Despite the blown call.
Albany didn‘t play well enough to
win. “I don't think anybody played
particularly well — it wasn't a good
solid learn effort. We got out of the
garlic just what we put into the
garlic — not very much. Our play
was less than inspiring. It wasn‘t
what I would call a good exciting

SUCCL'T garlic,

Schicfl'elin cour-

mented.

The big story this week is tomor-
row’s con ference showdown against
Binghamlon here at 3:00. The
Danes are 3-1 in the conference and
this game will be pivotal in deciding
their playoff chances.

“Our game tomorrow will be the
key game of the year for us. If we
can win the game it will re-establish
our credibility as a top ranked
learn." said Schicffelin.

He added, “A win would put us
in pretty damn good position. The
worst that could happen ifwc win is
that we would lie for first place in
the conference."

Albany suffered their only con-
ference loss to highly ranked
Oneonla early in the season, but
since that time Binghamton has
beaten the Dragons. This is
Albany‘s final conference rlralch.
but the Colonels still have to face a
hot Plattsburgh team.

Schieffclin expected the tearrr to
be at full strength tomorrow in-
cludirtg the possible return of Gior-
dano, who has been our witll u frac-
tured kncccup.

“We know the importance of this
garlic." said Schicffclin. “and we
just have to go out llrcrc and do it."

Behind the two-hit pitclrrng of
Ron Massaroni. the Albany State
baseball team won the opener of
Wednesday’s doubleheader with
Oswcgo. 6-0. But the Danes
couldn’t sustain the momentum.
and dropped the nightcap. 7-3. on
the season's filial day. Albany
ﬁnished with a 9-8 record.

“This is the first Albany tcanr
that ﬁnished with a winning record
in several years." said Dane coach
Rick Skccl. "Of greatest impor-
tance was the fact that we were 6-4
within the conference
(SUNYAC)-"

In the first game. the Danes got
all the necessary runs in the opening
frame. as three crossed the plated
on three hits. From then on. it was
all Massaroni.

“Massrrroni pitched a grcr game
for us." Skcel said. “He stayed
ahead of all their hitters."

Albany wasn't plagued by faulty
gloves this game. Dane fielding stip-

Sparked by a two-assist. one-goal
performance by Lynne Burton. the
Albany State women’s soccer team
shut out RPI. 5-0. yesterday in
Troy. It was the women booters‘ sc-
cond consecutive victory. and irr-
crcascd their record to 5-4.

“We played a really good offen-
sive game." said Albany coach
Amy Kidder. The Danes kept the
pressure on the Engineer defense

qualcly.

Ace Dane Iinrlcr Mike Esposito
took the loss ill the night cap for on-
lyl his second defeat against i'ivc
wrns.

I“Espo never got loose." Skccl
said. That was evident as Oswego
reached him quickly for si.\ runs ill
the first two innings. Albany ltad a
shot to get back irtto rllc ballgurnc.
but a Iirucc Rowlrntds grounder
resulted in an inning-ending double
play.

At the end of lltc fall campaign.
Skccl cannot help Imt be pleased
with his squad's pcrl'orrnancc.
After a hard recruiting year. the
coach is still laboring to turn
around the “slagurrting” program
(as he called it last year) that he
took over in 1979.

“I was pleased \\‘lIlI the irrlproic»

Freshman halfback Lisa Vince
also gave a fine performance at
I'Iarrsbtrrgh. Another essential
player was halfback Marcy Hain.
who was moved to fullback position
iit this game. S‘Both girls did a reall‘
nice job." said Kidder.

Alllttlly's goalie. Laurie Briggs
mudc cighr saves from a total of
twelve shots on goal. while l’lrill-
sburglr goalie I’am Black had to
make nineteen saves on forty-four
shots on goal. as Albany dominated
lllc garlic in that way.

Kidder rcrrlarkcd that the team's
performance was superior at I’latt-
sburgll. “Our first half of ball was
the best half we‘ve played all year.
()rrr passing was probably too per-
cent better than arty other garlic."
She attributed this performance to
the fact that tile Danes played a
purely offensive game.

Kidder said that lrer only real
concern ill lltc garlic was when the
Danes switched from tllcir offensive
garlic plan to a defensive garlic in
the last 30 minutes of play. Other-
wise she was pleased with the team's
efforts at controlling the ball. As
she said a few weeks earlier, “We
must get a goal early irt the garlic to
win. and we must protect it. putting
the other leurtl at a disadvantage.“
This is precisely wltal the Danes did
at I‘lullsburglr. Icading to their vic-
tory.
