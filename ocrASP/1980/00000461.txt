when they battled back to defeat
Union College in five games. 16-14,
13-15, 14-16, 15-8. 15-9. The win, in,
addition to a forfeit by Utica, raises
the spikers’ record to 12-5.

Albany is the toughest competi-

if you’re a "an of the Albany
lState defensive st. ondary. then you
don't want to remember the last
time the Danes played Cortlattd.
That was two years are). and the
Red Dragons threw for art
astronomical 436 yards. Tiie Cor-
tlaitd quarterback was good bit 34
of 67 passes. and one Red Dragott
receiver had 230 yards in catches by
himself. Yet. Albany won. 41-31.

But tltett. Cortland was en route
to a 5-5 season. The team that the
Danes will meet tomorrow on
University field at 1:30 has only
won a single contest in five, and are
in the midst of a three game losing
streak. including last week's 41-26
defeat at the hands of Brockport.

“They're not rinky-dinks,‘ said
Albany coach Mac Diange.
“Watching the (scouting) filtns. 1
thought they were a much better
football team. Playing Brockport.
they had their problems."

Defensively. they had some
massive problems. The Red
Dragons gave up 485 yards rushing
to the Golden Eagles. and let them
totally control the tempo of the
gartie (Broekport ran off 91 offen-
sive plays to 56 for Cortland). The
Eagles had 527 yards in total of-
fense, despite 135 more nulliﬁed hy
penalties.

One reason for their defensive
difficulties might arise form the in-
stallation of the 4-4 defense by new
coach Ed Decker (a former 1thaca
t assistant). The Red Dragons utiliz-
ed a 5-2 alignment (which depends

 

on streiigtlt) in past years. and that
is very different frotii their present
eight-titan front (that relies primari-
ly oti quickness).

“They (Cortland) liavcri‘t pttt
things together yet." said Albany
coach Mike Walsh. “They don't
haV' all the concepts (of the 4-4)
down yet."

Cortland's defensive woes cottlti
be a titajor factor itt tomorrow's
contest. The Danes are cotttitrg off

Union looked like an inspired
team from the beginning when they
reeled off eight poitits before
Albany scored. The Danes slowly
fought back, bitt Union still lead at
14-12. Albany refused to give tip

by Wayne Pet-reboot"

SASU anti SA strcd Chancellor
Wharton anti the SUNY llotrrd of
Trustees iii the State Strprctitc Court
Friday afternoon to contest the re-
cettt rootit rate increase.

The stilt is based on an alleged
violation of the Open Meeting Law
involving closed meetings held by
the Chancellor and [lie lloztrti on

April 22 and May lit, 1980. accor-
dirtg to SA attorticy Lewis Oliver.
Altliouglt the actual vote bit the rate
hikes was taken at art opcti meeting.
Oliver contended that "the ical
decision" was made at those closed
meetings. He used an affidavit sign-
ed by Sltttlctit 'I'rttstc Sharon Warti
to reinforce this claim.

Althouin the judge's decision

Flasher Nabbed Near
Fine Arts Building

by Judie liiscnberg

SUNYA Catiipus Police arrested
a man suspected of exhibitionism
in the Fine Arts Building last
Wednesday, accoring to lti-
vestigator Ciary O'Connor.

Kevin Golden. a 22—year old noti-
stttdcnt who has admitted exposing
himself before. was arrested for
loitering ratlier than public
lewdtiess because he “didn't get the
opportunity to expose himself.”
O'Connor said.

According to Campus Police
reports. police began investigating
the case after receiving several corti-
plaints from anonymous Fillt: Arts
female staff members. The women
rcportetlly said that several times
when they left the bitilditig at 5
17.111.. a man would expose his
genitals to tlierti frotn an open win»-
tiow of the first floor men's room.

O’Connor said they caught
Golden as he was fleeing front the
Fine Arts Building oti October 15.
He was arrested for loitering
because "he had no legitimate
business on campus at that time,"
Assistant Public Safety Director
John Heniglian said. Lettering is
the satne level of Clttlrge as public
lcwdness.

O'Connor added that Golden
gave a weak story when questioned
about his activities. “He claims he
always goes to the hathroorn in the
Fine Arts Building oti his way horire

from work." O'Connor said. “He
works iii Albany and lives
sotitewltcrc else. He's a cupcake ~
a real fruitcake."

“if it happens again." O'Connor
said, “We won‘t be as nice to him.
We’ll teach hint to stay away. We
don't tieed liim.

O’Connor added that Golden
was “very emphatically warned not
to coriie back oti campus again.“

According to O’Connor.
Golden's arraignment was to be
held in Albany Police Court yester-
day. lf found guilty. he ctiulrl
receive a fine and-or 15»day jail
sentence for loitering.

“Flashers arc iitrl uncommon on
campus," O‘Connor added. “The
Utiivcrsity attracts a lot of them."
According to Henighan. "it hap»
pens iii tltc dorms arid iii the gym ——
especially iii the wotiien's locker
room."

There have been several previous
reports of men exposing themselves
on campus. O'Connor said. There
is even ntiotlier flasher in the Fine
Arts Building. he reported.
O'Connor said police believe this
persort may be l4-years old. Police
are still investigating this case.

Another rnatt was arrested two to
three weeks ago for exposing
liitnself in the gym. He Wits in the
men‘s locker room and he reported-
ly exposed hittrself to a female stu-
dent on the pool's diving board.

Oliver stiltl hopefully that “the
judge was interested iii otrr
argtrrttctits." ()liver added that SA
and SASU are seeking to nullify the
iioatd of ’l‘rtistecs' decision to raise
the dorm rates $150 per year over a
four year period. amounting to
$600. ()livcr said if it is nullified.
money that students haic already
paid will be refunded.

Oliver claimed that the
Chancellor “used the device ot'clos-
ed session to keep the decision mak-
itig process secret" and, therefore.
“preventing stttdctit input." Since
the open meeting was not held trtitil
May 29, Oliver said that the
students were prevented front
tnobiliritrg" since most oftlietit ltati
left their campuses for the summer.
lie added that sttrdctit activity
could have made a difference. citing
that student lobbyitig littd assisted
ill the partial restoration of univer-
sity funds that had bccti cut in last
spring's state budget.

Oliver added that Ward could not
have wartictl students of the rate
hikes after they were initially

discussed at the April 22 tneeting
because “a provision iii the ex-
ecutive lrtw binds the strident trustee
to silence."

Jatie Snyder, who represented the
atltiiinistt‘tttion. said iii rehtrttal that
"whatever was discussed at the
closed meetings was discussed at the
opctt one." She added that “there
was no way the botrrd could have
made a dctettiiniation at the April
22 meeting." Snyder filed an af-
fidavit signed by the Chancellor.

which she claimed that the rate
hikes were only one possibility dur~
ittg the closed sessions. Oliver said
that the Ward affidavit eonfirttied
that the Chancellor had presented
different proposals, bttt “each pluti
included a dorm increase."
Referring to the judge‘s extensive
questioning of Snyder. SA Attortiey
Jack Lester said, “The judge tried
to put her oti the spot and she never
really answered." He said this was a
“good sign" for SA and SASU.

Yet on City Ordinance

by Bruce bevy

Albany Common Council Housing and Urban Renewal Committee
Chair Joseph Bttcchs promised on October 3 that the five-member
panel would meet within 10 days to discuss the proposed city security
ordinance. However. nearly three weeks later no decision has been
reached on the ordinance which would set the minitiium standards for
safety protection required by the landlords of rental housing.

While the landlords complained at it pttblic hearing about the ex-
pense of installing locks. solid core exterior doors. adequate lighting
and secure windows. tenants stated that their safety must come first,
especially with the Pine Hills Molester still at large and break-iris re~

maining commonplace incidents.

President's Task Force for Womens Safety member Terrianne
Faicone feels that “on the one hand women’s safety is not important
to the Common Council. but on the other hand the delay may be due
to the large number of people who showed at the hearing, putting a lot
of pressure on the council . . . either way they'll get a lot of ﬂack for

their decision."

SA President Sue Gold said she saw no significance in the delay. bttt
felt that “the landlords had been very organized and very vocal in
stating their case against the ordinance." Gold Continued that SA
would “review and evaluate all we can do to make sure the ordinance

eventually is passed."
