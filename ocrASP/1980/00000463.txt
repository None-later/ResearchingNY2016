SECONDS OF PLEASURf-LMONTi'iS OF TOURING WI'I‘I-l-

 

 

October 21, 1980

Anderson
Campaigns in
Schenectady

Schenectady. N.Y. (AP) Expressing
disappointment with what he calls
tlte “disgust” of Americans over
the 1980 presidential campaign. in-
dependent candidate John Ander-

son said last night he proposes “a

different philosophy."

“Millions of Americans have
concluded that all politicians are
either knavcs, fools or Charlatans.
and that you cart only vote when
you hold yottr nose." Anderson
told a standirtg-rootrt~otrly crowd at
Linton High School here.

“I want to reverse this trend.” he
said. “i want to bring millions of
disaffected voters back into the
political arena by giving them the
opportttuity to vote for the greater
good, not just the lesser evil."

Anderson said he thought his
election would bring a “bipartisan
character" to the presidency that
could solve tnany of the nation‘s
problems. including disagreements
over the SALT ll treaty.

“People are tired of the same old
partisan approach. . .that has left
things piled high on the agenda."
he said.

Anderson's speech was spott-
sored by the Schenectady Freedom
Forum, a group of business. profes-
sional and academic people.

Anderson referred to a recent
statcntent by Carter quoting the
president as saying he had a
“passiort for peace.“ Anderson
said. “We're not voting the person
who cart profess the most passion,
btrt for the person who cart best ptrt
us on the path to world peace.

“The fact of tire matter is. we
could rise a little less of Carter's
passion and a little more corti-
petencc. . ." Anderson said as the
rest of his sentetrce was drowned
out with applause.

"Mr. Reagan's chief contribu-
tions to public enlightenment this
year have included an otld distprisi-
tion on the lethal properties of
trees. anti a curious endorsement of
the salubriotts nature of oil slicks."

Nuclear Cloud  Not
Yet Produced Fallout

Washington (AF) Air invisible
cloud of nuclear debris from a
Chinese atomic botnb has not pro-
duced any detectable radioactive
fallout in its flight over the United
States. officials said Monday.

The leading edge of the 500 mile-
wide air mass was to reaclt the East
Coast at 8 p.m. EDT Monday and
tnove out over tltc Atlantic on Tries-
day. officials at the Natiortal
Oceanic and Atmosphereic Ad-
rnittistration said.

The cloud reached the U.S. Not—
thwest early Sunday. The l5n-
vironrnental Protection Agency said
its monitoring stations underneath
the clottd had not picked up any
measurable fallottt readings.

“No significant exposures are c.\-
pccted from ttirect radiation. We
don‘t anticipate arty cause for corr-
cettt." the lil’A said. The agency
said tltctc is still the possibility that
radiation lc\cls irt milk may increase
arid the agency said it will begin
sampling rrtilk on ’l‘ucsday.

Based on prevailing wind cur-
rents. the cloud was expected to

the United States with its midpoint
running along a line from
Washington state to Virginia.
NOAA said.

Tire agency predicted the radioac-
tive air rttass would extend front the
New York-Pennsylvania bordcr'to
mid-Florida when it reaches the
Atlantic.

The radioactive mass was travel-
ing at l26 miles per hour across the
Pacific Ocean. bit! since reaching
the United States its speed has drop-
ped to 58 mph. The altitude of the
first mass of microscopic debris was
pttt at 40,(X)0 feet.

The Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration announced that
because of ion radioactivity
readings it was suspending its direc-
tive for airline flights to avoid the
air mass.

health care and basic education." says Sullivan. "There will still be
Peace Corps volunteers teaching math. science and English. but they
will also have responsibilites in helping to develop the communities in
which they live."

“For VISTA." says Neil Carter. another Peace Corps/VISTA

-leadership and self-sufficiency among low-income groups and com-
munities."
