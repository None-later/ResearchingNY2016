( Early Rochester Tallies N
Top Women Boaters, 2-1

by Anne Cavanagh

Two first half goals by Rochester provided the necessary advantage
as the Albany State women’s soccer team was defeated by their
visitors, 2-1, on a rain-soaked field Saturday.

“The teams were well mdtched,” said Albany coach Ariiy Kidder.
Both teams played aggressively, with ball control being the key on the
wet turf.

Neither squad played very offensively. Rochester had only ll shots
on goal, but the Danes took an even less number (five).

Roclicster's Molly Hales scored at 25:20 on a “fumbling” goal, but
the gaiirc winner came off the foot of Sue Sikulc, who beat Albany
goalkeeper Laurie Briggs on a one-on-one at 29:52 of the first half.

The lone Dane tally came frorn Sue Stern off a crossover pass iii
front of tile goal by Lynne Burton.

Albany controlled play in the second half, birt they couldn't score,
and evened their record at 5-5.

Kidder noted several of lici players as havirtg finc games, especially
center halfback Lisa Frarlcc arrtl swccpcr back Shari Miller. “She‘s
consistently good," said Kidder of France. “She did a super job of
controlling the ball at midfield." Miller slionc through the rain by her
dcfcnsivc performance.

"it was an excellent game," Kidder said. “Winning when you play a
rotten gtlttlt' i‘. not satisfying. It's more important to play a good game,
Linn because we're 5-5 and we lost doesn‘t mean we're not a good ball

'l he Albany State volleyball team
continued their torrid play this
weekend, adding four more vic-
tories. The wins came over St.
Michael's College and Division ll
Vermont on Saturday and Vassar
and Skidmore on Thursday night at
University Gym to raise their record
to 16-5. '

.The spikers are now riding an
eight game winning streak and have
proved themselves one of the top
teams in the state. “We’re definite-
ly the top team in the area (in Divi-
sion “D.” said Albany volleyball
coach Pat Dwyer. “it looks like
we’ll be in the State Championships
unless we lose every game. We're
probably ranked about seventh or
eighth in the state, just guessing."

Dwyer noted that the team has
progressed tremendously since the
season began. “if we were to play
the teams that beat us right now we
would probably be able to beat

them,” he said.

He added that while their biggest
problems early in the year centered
around a lack of conﬁdence, “now
our problems mostly revolve
ariund being overconl'ident. When
things happen we start lensing up."

in Saturday's dual meet at Ver-
mont,thc Danes took both matches
in two games despite not being at
the top of their game. “We weren't
playing at otrr best. Nobody really
stood out," said Dwyer.

Albany defeated St. Michael’s
easily in the first game, but the lat-
ter came on strong in the second.
Albany lead, 13—4, but St. Michael’s
rallied to l4-12 before the Danes
could put a lid on it.

The University of Vermont also
proved little challenge for Albany in
the first game. which ended at
15-10, bill they reeled off eight con-
secutive points to start the second.
Albany cut down the lead, as they

have been doing all season, and slid
by their hosts, 15-“.

“We played very well," said
Dwyer. "It showed that we are a
good team — we were able to come
back against a good team.”

In the earlier matches Albany had
few problems with the weaker
Vassar and Skidmore squads. “We
played well enough to win — they
aren’t very strong teams," noted
Dwyer.

The Danes bested Vassar, 15-4,
15-11, and Skidmore, 15-12, 15-7,
with Dwyer making full use of his
roster. “Skidmore played well. We
had four subs in and they played
fine, but made sortie mistakes," he
said.

The spikct's next take their winn-
ing streak on the road to Oneonta
and then to the Binghamtun Invita-
tional on Saturday. “it should give
us some practice in tournament
play. I‘m hoping we peak around
then." said Dwyer.

by Michael Carmen

The Albany State mcn's cross

and Nick Sullivan who placed

better than expected, If we had a
runner or two come in a bit higher

It was bound to happen. Albany
had just come off its best Offensive
performance of the season. Cor»
tland, only one week ago. gave up
in excess of 500 yards to Brockport.
Albany was well aware of the pro-
blems that Cortland was having in
implementing their defense. The
Danes use the same one, and they
knew all the weaknesses. And Cor-
tland had a lot of weaknesses.

Albany exploited these insuffi-

ciencies for an incredible 522 runn-
ing yards, and blew the Red
Dragons off the rain-soaked field
for a 41-7 victory. Fullback Chuck
l’riore was Albany's leading rushcr
for the fourlli tirric in six games. His
182 yards on only 13 carries gave
him a total of 623 yards and put
him on a pace for a l,()()() yard
season over the Dartcs‘ 10 games.
"We needed a win like this very
badly," said Albany head coach
Bob Ford.

Cortland was no match for the
Danes in any respect. Their only
score came after a poor Dave Hardy
punt gave the Red Dragons posses-
sion on the Albany 36 yard line.
Sub quarterback Dave Hogeystn hit
Pete Schwaii over the middle, who
sprinted into the end zone. Only on
two other occasions did Cortland
enjoy the luxury of having the ball
in Albany territory and, on the
deepest of llrosc pcrietratiotis, the
Red Dragons got to the 45 — that
was it.

“We played our basic defense,"
said corncrback lid Ragulc (who is
also the Danes‘ leading tacklcr on
the season). “We really didn't do
anything special."

Albany didn’t do anything
special on offense either, at least
not strategically. The Dane policy
of taking what the defense gives
paid off for the second week iii a
row. Albany's standout offensive
litic read what the Cortland
defenders were doing, and rucrcly
adjusted accordingly.

“They left the whole rrriddlc

was get in front of them."

Boaters Tie Binghamton In A Physical Contest

Saturday, wlrilc Albany State was
celebrating the return of graduated
students and wclcorriing the parents

visitors hardly received a warm
welcome here on campus. Rather,
their visit turned ortt to be very bit-
ter and unfriendly. That group was

“They're tenth in the nation. l
don't think they’re better than we

Certainly, during the ninety
initiates of regulation and two tcn-
nrinutc overtime periods, Albany
played as well as, if not better than,
the nationally ranked tcatri. llut
Perhaps what characterized rhc
game most was the scrappincss of
bollr clubs. And with lenient of-
ficiating, this game became a
Physical struggle as well as a fines-re
soccer match.

The first half evidenced botli
Wiles of play. Physically, the hot-
tcst rnatcliup was between Albany's
Afrirn Neznj and llinghamtorr's
Neitlcrrncyer. lloth men used their
bodies on each hall and at tirrrcs,
harsh words were exchanged. Also,
Dane midfielder Vlndo Scrgovich

“We were very physical today.

Skill-wise, no one player better

goalkeeper liilly Stcltcn. He came

ing lltc first half. The first Hill was
on a shot unloaded from point

second was a oncliatnlctl longing

That was all the scoring iii the
first half. During intermission,
Schicl'fclin brought his team into

The second half saw a lot of rain
and little scoring. Al'ch having

half (llinghaniton (i, Albariy 5),

of low shooting play ill the second.

tltc clock to end regulation liriic and
did the satire for botlr overtiriie
periods. In fact, in the closing
minutes of play of regulation,
Albany threatened in liingliamlon's
end but came tip empty-handed.
During the intense overtime
periods, Steffen turned in some
beautiful saves, helping Albany
gain the tie.

Yet, there was still a tiiattcr that
had to be settled ~— thc determina-
lion of the SUNYAC champions.
This game was the last conference
game for Albany, and a Dinghani-
ton loss in their last conference
garlic against l’Iuttsbttrgh would put
liotlt tctuns iii a lie for the top
SUNYAC spot. A penalty kick
shootout was played to determine
the situation, which the ('oloniuls‘
won, 4-2.

The \isitors began with a goal off
of Steffen. The first Dunc shooter,
.‘s'ctcrt', followed willi u slrol that

Steffen on a ground shot that the-
l)anc kccpcr got it hand on. Arid
after Albany's Keith Falconcr
.seorcd to pull the Danes within one,
Steffen riiadc a great savc going to
his left.

Next to step up was Scrgovich,
btrt his sliol was saved by Quinlan.
And when Binghamton scored on
the next kick, the conference churn-

pioriship was theirs with a 4-2
shootout win. Of course, this
shootout would not be necessary in
determining tltc winners of the
SUNYAC, if llingliariiton goes on
to defeat l’lattsburglr.

"ll would be nice to win the
SUNYACs, but it‘s the NCAA
playoffs that counts," said Scliicf-
felin. "We have four games left. If
we win. we deserve to be there."
