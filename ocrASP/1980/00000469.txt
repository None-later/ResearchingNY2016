Senate Candidates Spar

‘ Albany, N.Y. (AP) New York’s three U.S. Senate candidates
said little new on issues Thursday night in their latest debate.
but continued their personal attacks against each other.

At almost every opportunity, Rep. Elisabeth Holtzman tried
to bring up the matter of integrity - wondering aloud if
Republican Alfonse D‘Antato has enough.

D’Amato, on the other hand. spent much of his time attack-
ing Miss Holtzman as being against a “strong America."
And he accused Miss Holtzman and incumbent Sen. Jacob
Javits of not doing enough in Congress.

Javits meanwhile. running on the Liberal Party line after los-

ing the GOP primary to
Democrat Holtzman is
“inexperienced.”

The Student Association now

trmt mtmngcmenl. bus drivers, long
shorcmcn. university professors.
and a Polish ntirne troupe in the
cast of a drama now heading for its
climax at Albany's Ramada lrnr.

SA voted Wednesday night to
lend their support to the pickcling
members of the Hotel, Motel, and
Restaurant Employees Union Local
417. who are urging a boycott of
their employer. the Albany Ramada
Inn. until their demands are rrrct.

you expect students to bclicvc that

the federal courts ruled that for
years the (‘or'uing (Albany Mayor

way made in the nine—week long
strike.

The package. presented at o 3:00
p.m. meeting by hotel manager
Peter Quadriui. represented the
first major effort to be tirade by
Quadrini in settling the strike.
Because of his actions at previous
meetings. Quadrini has been accus-
ed by workers of failing to negotiate
in good faith.

According to James McClellan.
member of the Union of University
Professions, which has avidly sup-
ported thc strike. the presence of
the students on yesterday's picket
line may have influenced the change
in the manager's attitudes.

Central Council pledgcd their
support of the strike and urged the
university community to boycott
the hotel at Wednesday's mcciing
following a presentation by SASU
delegate Tony Gitu'dina. (iiurdinrr
said SA recognized the "positive
and responsive support the unions
have always given the university,"
specifically during the tuition hike
and budget cut protests of the last
few years. The SA resolution strricd
that the employees of the inn "are
being paid uulivablc wages" turd
that the management had “refused
to give the employees basic rights."

The employees have been asking
for n (\5 cent wugc incrcrrxc. u
seniority system. and paid vrrcu
lions.

early yesterday afternoon. The
resolution included a request that
“students. faculty. alumni. parents.
and other members ol' the university
cornrnrinily join togctlrcr...by
boycotting the Ramada inn."

At the negotiating table a few
hours later. Quadrini presented
what McClellan called “a mountain
of a package" prepared by the
manager‘s lawyers. The 90-minute
rrrccling that ensued was decidedly
lortgcr than the other meetings with
Quudrini. and it represented llrc
first time that Quadrini directly adv
dressed the issues of the strike.

McClellan insists that the
students and teachers on line played
a big role in bringing about a pro-
ductive meeting. and that Qnadrini
carried the resolution in his pocket
to the meeting room.

“i think that when Quudrini saw
the students showing up, it rnighl
have brought him around. thn he
’cl't his office to go down to the
meeting. i think the brrnclr shouting
to him had its effect.“

The negotiation package
prepared by Quudr'iui is still far
from satisfactory in the \vorkcrs‘
cycs. Mct‘lcllun said that "he‘s giv»
ing with onc hand and taking with
the olltct."

As rm cxtunplc. employees lnrd
requested that a meal be included us

postrl, ()unrhirri agreed to allow the
employees soup and sandwich din»

said.
