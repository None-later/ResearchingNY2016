Putting the Crunch on Nestle Co;

A by Frank Gll

-Thé l2 Capital District members

According to an lNFACT report.
Nestlc's "unethical promotion" of
infant formula has made it the
world's leading seller of baby for-
mula in developing countries where
misuse is most likely.

The lNFACT report states that
since infant formula in poor coun-
tries can cost up to 60 percent of the
family income, mothers overdilute
it to make it last longer. Also, poor
families do not have sufficient fuel
to properly sterilize baby bottles.
lack refrigerators and have to use
contaminated bottles. The bottle
and formula. then. become carriers

of “Bottle Baby Disease." which is
characterized by diarrhea,

around the boycott and is now suc-
ceeding. When the organization
first formed. they could not per-
suade Nestle to meet with them.
Now. they have no trouble meeting
with the company.

lNFACT's main goal at SUNYA
is to educate and gains support of
students in the Nestle issue. lN-
FACT mcntber. Scott Sotnmer. said
that the main area on campus to
take action would be in the dorms.
"A greater victory can be won if we
educate students and they stop buy»
iiig Nestle products.“ Sommer said.

According to Sommer. lNFACT
plans to stage some action around
campus to get students involved.
Such ideas as an on-campus mailing

have to get right to the students,”

arranged. “Also. getting the school
faculty involved 'ls important,"
Sommer emphasized.

Long-range plans for lNFACT at
SUNYA include a student referen-
dum 'to.be approved by Central
Council. Sommer feels this would
n01 take place for a while. however.
The referendum would affirm stu-
dent solidarity with the boycott and
would require that all purchasing
agents at SUNYA not patronize
Nestle products.

Some major endorsers of the
boycott include Lt. Governor
Mario Cuoﬁio. Dr. Benjamin
Spock, Gloria Steinem. and the
American Federation of Teachers.

Capital District INFACT chair,
Brian O’Sliaughnessy, stated an ad
will appear in this Tuesday's Times-
Unimt about Nestle to coincide with
the Halloween holiday. The ad will
include such topics as Nestle's
unethieiil promotion of intent for-
niiila.
