ing at us. i can see why Albany State is so
difficult to get into. The level of sophistica-
tion here is without parallel.

Maybe they were laughing because it is so
obvious that we are discriminated against.
Or maybe it seemed silly to them that simp-
ly because of one's sexual preference a
group should have to isolate its problems
from those of the rest of society. And they
must have realized then that the majority of
sexual assaults. for example. are committed
by heterosexual men, not homosexuals as
past myths would have you believe. I realize
now these rational thoughts and many
others must have been going through ihcir
minds. And that must be the reason wiry
none of them bothered to stop at our table.
It really gratifies me to know how
"informed" so many people here are about
homosexuality. Otherwise I would be led to

believe that many people here find their ig- .

This winter. freshmen males will be faced with what is probably the most
difficult and painful decision ever placed before them, one that their older
classmates had wrestled with this past summer —— whether or not to register
with the Selective Service System.

And once again. the Government does not wahl them to tlrink of the sign-up
as a matter of choice -— but rather as a direct order -— to be carried out obe-
dientiy with no questions asked.

But registration is a choice. and a highly personal one too. And there will be
plenty of questions asked which will need some answers. Registration is not a
simple act without any consequences. it can disrupt the course of your life
forever. It can eventually separate you from your family and your surroun-
dings. lt could even moan — especially with world tensions as they exist —- that
you won't be alive in a few years. '

Some students consider registration a patriotic gesture — one they will pro—
udly perform. To these youths. a pledge to the US. Military — when and if
they should call — is art iirrportant and responsible act.

Ollrcrs feel that registration is a profoundly un-Amcrican institution and
conscription as slavery ol' the individual. Many of these young men will refuse
to sign up and will instead choose to fight for what they believe in.

Yet. most males eligible for rcgisiration are unsure ofwlrcrc they stand. The
many messages they have been receiving iirc complex and conflicting — and
they are only confused. Thch is nothing unusual about such a position —— our
leaders had never first brought the registration ideii up before ihc rrrinds of ihis
chosen generation; not" will they provide ClL'ilI’ answers as to whle is to be done
