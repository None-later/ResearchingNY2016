Live And Loam_\

Living together may not prepare
people for marriage any better than
the old-fashioned approach to
meeting and courting:

At least that’s what Ray Short, a
sociology professor at The Univer-
sity of Wisconsin in Platteville is
claiming.

Short compiled a proﬁle of live-
in couples aged 25 and under,
drawn from several university
studies on co-habitation without
marriage.

He says he-found that most living
together arrangements are for con-
venience —— not for keeps —- and
last usually from about three weeks
to a maximum of five years — or an
average of about 9.6 months. Few
led to marriage. according to the
researcher.

Short says that men generally
enter Into living-in arrangements
casually with no intention of many
ing. but as art easy access to sexual
gratification, while many women
want security and often end up
working to support partners who
are students.

 

Short says: “The basic pattern I
see in live-in arrangements is ir~
responsibility. but most of the ex-
ploitation in these situations is done
by the males because on the whole
they do trot invesrsas much enro-
tional energy into the relationships
as most of the females. They are ac-
cepting the privileges of marriage,
with few or none of its obliga-
lions."

According to the U.S. ccrrstrs

i'ZbllAG

_bureau. 274.000 couples under the
age of 25 were living together in
I979. almost to times the number
for I970. Short says. however. that
polls sltowa turnaround today: He
cites statistics pointing to a drop in
the percentage of live-in'couples age
25 and under from 20.9 in 1977 to
20.4 in 1979.

Lovers Llft

Supermarkets are being plagued
with a new kind of burglary.

American Business magazine
reports that "sweetheart crime." a
crime‘bcing carried out by a store
cash register clerk and his or her
lover. are costing American retailers
millions of dollars ittiprofits each
year.

Herc's how it works: at a super-
market. one sweetheart picks out an
order of cxpcnsivc mcats. liquors or
other items and takes thcm to the

‘CllCCk-Olll station where the other
sweetheart works. A purchase of
$50 or so is then rung up at pcrlraps
just $15 and the non-working
sweetheart walks off with the
goods.

A survey of 27 lurgc supermarket
chains recently found that losses
due to “sweetheart crime" were
estimated at $l5,()l)t) it year per
store.

The magazine quotes Norman
Kivcn, head of Norman Industries,
a Chicago electronic scctrrlty firm as
saying that inflation crcatcs enough
irrccrrtive to ensure that “swccthcart
crirrrc will get worse before it gets
better."

$22,750 to cloSe down his store. and
has extracted a promise from him
that he will never open another
lteadshop in Eagan.

Eagan, a city of 22,000. has ﬁled
suit last year against the mak'n
Magic Shop after enacting an or-
dinance that outlawed the sale of
drug paraphernalia. However, the
case was appealed to the federal
courts. which ruled that the anti-
heads'liop law was unconstitutional.

So Eagan officials did the next
best thing: they gave owner Robin
Geiger almost 523,000 in cash. and
told him to take his business
elsewhere.

Educated Screams

A group of Cornell University
students say they've found the
perfect way to relieve the tertsiotrs
of academic life —— organized
screaming.

livery night at It p.m.. dozens of
residents of Cornell's north campus
reportedly go to their windows and

. scream. Tltcy say they are
following the lead of the
"primates" — six freshmen who
have formed the primal scream
club.

 

'I‘hc primates endorse a two-
nrirrutc nightly session of rtonscn-
sical screaming, featuring grtrnts
and groans. htrt no words. Some
students, however. are rcportcdly
turning the scream sessions into
half—hour orgies of instills between
residence halls.

I'r'irrrrrl scream club members ——
sporting primate t—shirts and
posters ~ say they plan to corttirrrrc
tlrcir cxcrcisc, and that they'll stage
scrctrrrr-ins at various crrrrrpus sitcs
and try to spread the practice to
other schools.

 

Gay Market ,

Major advertisers are beginning
to target their ads openly at the.gay
market in the United States.

The trade publication Advertis-
ing Age reports that many large cor-
porations are beginning to see the
gay community as “a new kind of
minority group."

According to Advertising Age.
Seagrams will begin using gay
newspapers in November to adver-
tise its gin; while Simon .‘2 Schuster
is already advertising its books in
many gay publications.

Others said to be eyeing the gay
market are Anheuser-Busch and the
marketers of Mel! Scotch. along
with major airlines. travel and per—
sonal care product companies.

According to Durrlea the Citizens
Party is requesting a Board of Elec-
tion hearing on this matter by Morr-
day, October 27. due to the
nearncss of tire upcoming election.

If the proposals are rejected, the
Citizens Party will have to decide
whether to return to the federal
court to pursue the issue. Dunlca
said that their strongest case is the
one regarding the extra registration
day. btrt that the lioirrd of Elections
will probably not react to their re-
quests.

is going to be in the secondary
again." The Albany fullback
rambled for 182 yards last week.

Playing at Norwich. a military
:rcademy. may pose some problems
for any visiting tcanr. and with the
fierce rivalry between the Cadets
and the Danes. the home ﬁeld ad-
vantage could be a factor.

“It‘s always tough to have to
play Norwich at Norwich," said
Collins. “It's got to help them."

The Cadets also get good atten-
dance for football games. so the
crowd might affect the outcome.

“They have a tendency to scram-
'ble (panic) when they get behind,"
Collins said. "The quicker you
score, the quicker'you quiet down
the crowd."

One thing that can be assured
wlrcncvcr the Danes play Norwich is
that the game will be a physical bat-
tlc.‘ Last year. Albany won on the
scoreboard. but lost on the trainer's
table. Several key players were
bruised in the game, contributing to
the dcnrisc of Albany‘s season front
then on.

“They could be 0-6, brrt they hit.
I've got all kinds of respect for
them," said Albany center Mike
Arcuri. “You know. even if the
game is 100 to nothing. you’re go-
ing to come otrt of the game sore,"

“I think it will be a physical game
—— it always has been." Myntcr
said. “I know that none of our kids
will back down. It's just tr ntattcr of
going orrl Ihct‘c anti cracking
lrcatls."

“These are the kind of game:

Itirructl. “Everybody knows (hit
