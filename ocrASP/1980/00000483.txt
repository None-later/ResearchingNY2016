Rivalries are. to coin a cliche, the
kind of things that make ordinary
football games events. And when
the rivalry in question is between
two squads that have been so evenly
matched in the past that only two of
the six games between them have
had a margin of victory of more
than five points. the event aspect of
the next game becomes even tnore
intense.

Such will be the case tomorrow.
when the Danes travel to Nor-
tltficld. Vermont to face Norwich.
And there could be a slight revenge

Albany with a powerhouse offense.

aspirations. only to be settt back

minute touchdowrt drive. and a

“They hate us." said Albany
fullback and leading ground gairtcr
Chuck Priorc. “Tlte way we beat
them last year. they’re going to be
up for us.” It was two key runs by
Priorc on that final drive that set up
the winning touchdown.
“Last year. there's no question
that if they had beaten us, they
would have gone to the NCAA
playoffs," said Albany head foot‘
ball coach Bob Ford. “It's been a
pretty good rivalry."

But in 1979, Norwich was na-
tionally ranked. among the Division
111 leaders itt rushing yardage arid
total offense. and very much in the
national eye. Now though, the
Cadets are 3—3. and. accordittg to

SUNYA Speaker

Schlesinger Supports Anderson

by Susan Mllllgan

Expressing support for presiden-
tlal candidate John Anderson and
referring to effects of the two-party
system, historian arid former Kett-
nedy speech-writer Artltttr Settles-
inger. Jr. addressed SUNYA
students yesterday irt art evcnt sport-
sored by thc Political Science
Association.

Schlesinger contended that “the
democratic process is too itnportartt
to be lcft to tltc two tttajor parties."
He added that "ideas are denied
outlet in the tnajor parties. (attd it is
this) failttrc that ’tlllSCS tltird parties
to arise."

The historian remarked that
although he "would rtot suggest
that rrll third parties have becrt
devoted to liberal or noblc objcc»
tivcs...tltird-party candidates
revitalize our politics...gi\c its fresh
perspectives."

Schlesinger expressed dissatisfac-
tiott with candidates Carter and
Reagan. attd urged studcnts to
“vote witlt their cottscicncc."

"l’coplc say Anderson crtn‘t win
~ and lie won't." ltc conceded.

 

 

"But a vote for Anderson is a
useful \'ote...it‘s the only way to
rebuke the major parties for offer-
ing us such trivial figures as can-
didates. the only way to show
massive disgust with these
ridiculous alternatives.

“To vote for Carter or Reagan
will only encourage tltc rttajor par-
ties that they cart get away with
this."

Schlesinger attacked Reagan's
disbelief irt “racial justice.“ ttotittg
that Reagatt voted against the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. artd remarked
that Carter is “a man wlto on his
record ttttd his competence has not
earned tctt rttorc rttintrtcs in the
White House.“

He added that lie “doesn't think
it will tttnkc ntrtclt of a difference if
(‘artcr or Reagan is elected."

Schlesinger said at a press conv
l'ercncc later that it would be bcttcr
for tire Dctttocratic l’arty if Rcttgan
won tltc election. He noted that
third parties in the past. such as tltc
Populist party. have “cltungcd ma-
jor prrt‘tics frottt within."

“1f (‘urtcr wins. tltc Democrats

irrger predicted. “But if Reagan is
elected. the Democrats will be
liberated from Carter — they will
no longer need to defcrtd a presi-
dent who is more conservative than
the party."

“if Reagan wins the election.
Dctttocrats will have to start look»
ing at the issues again."

Concerning Anderson‘s capacity
as a third-party forcc. Schlesinger
said that “what cxtcttt it will be a

son himself."

Schlesinger added that Reagan
"would be a drHtothing presi-
