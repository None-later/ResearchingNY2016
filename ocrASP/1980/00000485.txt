This year over fifteen women‘s
organizations are available to the

ed “Where are the Women?” was

that although women were
represented in the tiniversity work
force. their status was consistently
lower tltart that of their male

ASRC’s research was concluded
last year. The SAHP system provid- 1

Chief of Utilities Wayne Allen at
SUNYA‘s Plant Department. which
tnaintains the SAHP system, has
devised an indicator of energy use
and efficiency for the unitersity
buildings. The indicator. BTU’s per

tells how many tiTU‘s of energy
were needed to provide heat aiid
ltot water for one square foot
of the bttilding for one year.

According to Allen, over the
three-year period frottt Fall '77 to
