diaper diversion

What do you give to the baby
who has everything? Well, how
about designer diapers?

Believe it or not. The New York
TlIHES is reporting that Calvin Klein
has conic out with a line of denim
diaper covers featuring the designer
label on a hip pocket.

According to a spokesperson for
Saks Fifth Avenue. the designer
diapers are selling like crazy. even
though the price tag is $15 apiece.

One group not particularly crazy
abotrl the idea is the C'hildrcnswcar
Mattufacturcrs Association. Says
tlte group's treasurer Totty
Scltwarll: “If you watrt my opi-
nion, l tltittk the idea is absolutely
ridiculous. 'l‘hc desigttcr deserves to

Yawning is good for you.’

The British magazine Weekend
quotes Dr. John Clyde. an English
dietician, as saying that not only
does yawning help you relax, it also
adis in digesting food.

Weekend- says. in fact, that
vawning has been included in a pro-
gram of exercises published by the
Central Council for Physical
Recreation in England. The
publication claims that a few good

healthy yawns are almost as good
for you as early morning exercises.

. pot plot holds no weight

Many marijuana users claim they
get attacks of the "munchies" —
and that they sometimes go on
eating hinges — when they are ston-

As a result of these
medical researchers suggested that

. . . kicked out of a job

Calling a woman a "hitch" itt
ttrrgcr isn't enough to get a man
fired from his job. but calling a
trratr a “faggot” warrants booting a
woman ottt tltc company door.

At least that‘s what happened itt
lvlichigart recently at the Acorn
Distributing (‘ornpany itt Dctroit.

It seems that an cntploycc, An-
nette Nclsott. called a co-workcr a
"faggot" dtrrittg it treated discus-

“The rtccd for young pcople to
be informed attd to consider goirtg
on record as a conscientious obit-c-
tot to war has never bcctt greater
tltart it is this fall." says Spears.

"'l'hc Suprcmc (‘ottr‘t's decision
on (ittItl/tr'rg' vs. 'l‘rrrr. :t scx-
discrirnirtatiort case involving the
draft and registration. will be final
this wintcr."cottrtncats Spears. “it
is cspccially important for women
to tcali/c that they could be ordered
to register for tire dral't. and
perhaps be drafted. They too must
consider tltcir position on war.“

“Unless students begin to think

cotrscictttiotts objection claims artd
other options, tltcy are certain to be
caught unprepared." says Spears.

“There is growing sentiment
witlrirt Congress to begin dcbatc
early next year on whether ri peace-
time draft‘should be started." he
says. "it is irtrportant for young
people to realize that under the cur-
rent draft law. all men between the
ages of 18 and 26 are eligible to be
drafted. Also. students should

know that there is no longer a col-

that .shc has as nrctttt rigltt to call a

has.
