Plattsburgh slides

 

by Larry Kahn

The Albany State and Platt-
sburgh women’s soccer teams both
save incredible performances here
on Saturday. Plattsburgh emerged
the 2-0 victors, but tlte real enemy
for both teams was the weather. A

All but 10 minutes of the hour
and one half game were played in a
cold and unrelenting rainstorm. By
the second half, a major portion or
the field was underwater attd the re-
mainder was so slippery and muddy
that control of the ball was almost
impossible.

"The field conditions were hor-
rendous." said Albany women's
soccer coach Amy Kidder. “There
is no way you can come back with
weather like that."

Albany dominated play in the
first half. But, despite several near
misses. they couldn’t get on the
board. Plattsburglt broke the ice
when they capitalized on an Albany
tripping infraction in the penalty
area. Kathy Rose banged in tile

penalty shot for their first score.

When the teams came out for the
second half. the rain-was pouring
down even harder. it was difficttlt
for the soaking wet and muddy
players on either team to control the
ball as it wouldn‘t roll more than it
few feet at ti time in tire thick
sludgc.

Both teams gnyc outstanding cf-
forts in the most adverse conditions
possible. Kidder singled ottt LlSLt
France as playing particularly hard.
and also noted that i’lttttsbtti'gh
played tt better game tlntn when
Albany dcfctttcd them it wcck ttnd it
half earlier.

The Dancs‘ next gttmc is against
Vttssztr on Wednesday, at liontc at
3:30, and then against Springfield
on Saturday at “:00.
