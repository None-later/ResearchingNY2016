Ohe hundred. fifty-one cross
country runners trekked'across the
Albany campusdn a steady rain to
compete in the fourteenth annual
Albany invitational Meet. When~it
all ended. the squad from Siena
Colleger grabbed first place in the
Four Year College Varsity Race
with 53 points. ‘

The Danes were able to manage a
ninth place ﬁnish among the 18
teams which participated in the
race. “We ran fairly well. There
were no major surprises. i expected
us to ﬁnish in either ninth or tenth
position," stated Albany's men's
cross country coach Bob Munsey.

The overall winner in the event
was Siena’s Tom Dalton. who
clocked in at 24' minutes. 59
seconds. This finish was the ninth
fastest time recorded on the Albany
5.05 mile layout. lncidettlally.
Dalton has his name in the Albany
record books by also tallying tlte
twentieth and twenty-third best tlm-
ings on the course.

Comittg across the finish line first
for the Danes was Scott James. He
completed the five mile course in
26:14. good for it seventeenth place

finish in the large field..“.lames had
a good placing. Histime was fast
for the course." commented
Munsey. '
Trailing James for the Danes was
Todd Silva, who has become the
team's regular number two man in
recent weeks. Silva was timed at
27:07. Falling in behindISilva were
Nick Sullivan (27:20). Tim Bradley
(27:27). and Chris Lant (27:29).
“We had no real major upsets.
We ran pretty well, and 'i was
satisﬁed with the team’s perfor-
-mance.” said Munsey. ' '
Overall in the meet. the Universi-
ty of Massachusetts fell in behind
Siena College with 93 points. The
third place team was Cortland (114
points). I
individually. Larry Sayers of
Keene State finished second. and
also had his name etched’into the
Albany State cross country record
books by runrting the eighteenth

.fastest tinte on the course.

The entire race was conducted in
the rain. which was not really an
obstacle for tltc runners. “Most
tracksters like performing in the
rain. they think it's fun. The basic
problem is the mrrd. The last three-
qrtartcrs of a mile of the meet had

Munsey.

The Dane Imentor was very

satisfied by the output of Sullivan.
“Nick has really rebounded. He is
starting to run well. He could be a
good runner in the future. This is
only his first year on varsity cross
country." said Munsey.

The Danes will receive two weeks
of well-needed rest before they have
to compete in the New York
Association Meet in Fredonia.
Twenty-two schools are taking part
and the coach is looking to placing
among the top ten schools.

Following that meet, Albany will
host the NCAA Qualifying Meet on
November 15. Albany is basically a
longshot to make the NCAA Cham-
pionship as a team. but Munsey ex-
pressed optimism in James and
Silva making the nationals in-
dividually.

“Our team probably won‘t make .

it (nationals). but it will be good ex-
perience. They are definitely com-
ing along. The team is very young. i
am proud of the team; the Diaper
lirigade will rtot quit and our run-
ners are consistently lowering their
best times." Munsey concluded.

It’s playoff speculation time for
coach Bill Schieffelin and the
Albany State varsity soccer team.
But. all that will end next week
when the NCAA awards those
desired playoff bids for Division
ill. But before then. the Danes
ntust face RPl on Wednesday and
Kean College on Saturday. if
Albany does well in those matches.
Schieffelin should be in a strong
position to graciously accept a tour-
rtanrertt invitation.

Currently. Albany is 7-3-I. and
ranked tltird among Division [II
schools in New York State. Accor-
ding to tire tournament format. the
NCAA nttrst choose the top four
contending learns irt the state. So
right rtow Albany's chances look
good.

“l'rtt looking forward towards
getting it bid. We're irt third place
and they‘re hrtrtding out foirr

"i can't say we weren't prepared.

“it's hard to sin ltow lightly we
took them. Some of tire kids were

opporteut)." Ford continued. "i
just had the feeling that we weren't
taking them very seriously this
week."

Reynolds noted similar feelings.
“it just seemed that we weren't

 

 

come back." said Schieffelln.
“That’s one of the problems you
face when you have two excellent
goalkeepers."

This season the Danes' strength
has been hardly limited to the
goalkeeping crew of Giordano and
Steffen. in fact. it’s been evenly
distributed to all parts of the Danes'
successful attack. Consider the
defense. led by Keith Falconer and
Luis Arango at the sweeper and
stopperback positions. respectively.
The defense has never allowed more
titan four goals in any one game.
Only against Hartwick did the total
ever reach that high. and they are a
highly rated Division l club. The
midfield. under the leadership of
tire veteran Vlado Sergovich. ltas
done a good job. While at the sartte

felin pushed for a rescheduling of
the contest. St. Francis coach
Carlos Tramantozzl was very reluc-
tant to comply. St. Francis “didn't

seem to want to play too badly."

according to Schieffelin.

“i guess they didn‘t want to play
us — a Division lll school — for
fear of losing." the Albany coach
added.

Schieffelin feels that the NCAA
should take that into account when
eontpiling the upcoming rankings
later in the week.

Still. in order to claim a spot In
the NCAA tournament playoffs.
Albany must do well against RH
and Kean. Both teams are fairly
even and should provide the Danes
with two touglt contests.

“if we play well on Wednesday
and Saturday. we hopefully should
get a bid." commented Schieffelin.

Stcffcrt feels that the hooters are
r-ndy to take on any opposition
that RPI and Kean may offer. as
well its any the NCAA may provide.
That is. as lortg as the team remains
irt good physical condition.
