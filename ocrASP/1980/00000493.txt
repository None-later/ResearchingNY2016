Dane Offense Shut Down By Emotional» Norwich

69 Yard Punt Return, Ineffective

by Bob Bellaflore

NORTHFIELD. VT. -— Tlte dif-
ference in the lockerrooms was to
be expected after a game that meant
as much to the teams involved. And
this game meant a lot.

Albany came with a four-game
winning streak and their two most
impressive offensive performances
of the year. Witlt a few good
breaks, a blow-out or two. and a
loss ntaybe by another front litre
team. tlte Danes might Itave Itad a

tlrent nine straight dual tttatclr vic»
tories. boosting their season record
to I7~5.

Saturday. the team traveled to
liinghamton to partake irt the in-
vitational tournament. The eight
participating tcanrs were split up irr-

qu Ford. “It's amazing that the
game was so close. because we sure-
as-hell didn't keep it close."

Basically. the Danes could do
nothing at all offensively against a
tough Norwich 4-4 defense.
Albany's wishbone could mttster up
a measly 164 yards or total offense
(I46 on the ground). The passing
game was good on only one of tI
aerials. Albany tried all the
reverses. optiotr passes. and mis-
directions it could, bttt still was
hopelessly ineffective.

"I called just about everything
we ltavc. ttrrd I can't remember
anything We had site"ss' with."
Ford said. “They whipped us up
front artd wltipped us on the cor-
rter."

“Del'ertsivcly. they just handled
everything we did." said Albany of—
fens'ivc coach Clary Reynolds.
“()vcrall offensively. we did a ltor-
rcudous job. ’lltcrc wasn't one
thing we cottld go to."

Early iii the garrtc. ortc thing the
Danes cotr_|dtt't do was get good

tittrcs irr the first qttattcr. The Danes
started their second possession on

 

their own sevett. and their third set
of downs on their four.

“Our kicker put thetn irr a little
every time." Mynter said. Not only
were McClurg’s punts difficult for
Datte returner Don Bowen to Iran-
dle in the rain. but the Cadet
coverage prevented arty substantial
runbacks.

Dcl'ensively. Albany yielded a
modest 225 yards total offense, attd
only broke for one tottcltdowtt
drive. A Dave Hardy pttttt frottt his
