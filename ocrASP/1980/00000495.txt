October 31, 1980

by Matt Haddad .

It was out of frustration'over the
lack of good times at the regular
neighborhood bars that Bunyan
gave thisreportcr the idea to do a
piece on off-beat bars. Though the
wltole idea sounded like a cheap
ploy to lure me out on a Tttesday

night, it did seemas if it would

make interesting reading, and
besides, I have never been com-
pletely immune to such scductiona.
So we determinedly ventured into
the night in search of a bar with
something different.

vContsumen News

:_.____—

Yates Street was to be a mere
thoroughfare on the way to bigger
and better things, but our eyes were
ltclplessly drawn to a quaint little
tavern that seemed to beg not to be
noticed. We quickly parked
haphazardly across the street and
approached the rug covered steps
leading to the great wooden door of
Putsie‘s Place. My companion com-
mented with its ﬂickering electric
candles that this scented like an
“old man’s bar."

As I carefully turned the tarnish-
cd knob attd opened the door, ottt
worst cxpcclalions unfolded as the
sight of four stubbin haired old
hoozchounds with heady blue eyes
and funny wide ears gave us a long
pcttctrating stare. As I turned to my
right to avoid their eyes I noticed an
8x10 portrait of John F. Kennedy
smiling at tile, daring Inc to lauglt.
Instead, I cooly walked towards a
row oflablcs and high stools, leav-
ing dcar Bunyan an excuse to keep
going.

To break tltc ice, I decided to buy

 

the ﬁrst round. The bartender. a
reserved but friendly woman in her
early forties, explained that Pabst
and Genesee were 30 cents a glass
and $2.25 per pitcher, while mixed
drinks came to one dollar even.
Bottles of Miller (7 ounce size) were
45 cents each. Sin'Ce it was sure to be
a long night I buried the thought of
a frosted pitcher and laid down 90
cents for two Miller eights'. While l‘
had taken care of the beers, my
companion had alrcay begun casing
the joint. He reported that the juke
box was standard but the songs
were very laid back. It was right
lltcn that I realized it was Bobby
Darren’s crooning voice in the
background.

After Bunyan bought the next
round, a strange feeling of comfort
began to overtake me. Sitting in my
ltigh stool, sipping on a Gencsee
draft I began to admire the Hallo-
ween dccorations which covered the
walls of Putsic‘s Place floor to cell-
ing, but it was time to move on.

New Scotland Avenue was the
next stop, 6 New Scotland to be
exact, the home of Harpo’s. Cont-
parcd to the lazy backwardncss of
Putsic's, Harpo’s is a more
sophisticated gin mill stocked with
many imported and domestic beers.
if ttotltittg about Harpo's is off-
beat, certainly its specials are,
which run on Monday (Budweiser;
pitcher SLSO. mug 45 cents),
Wednesday (Molsons; pitcher
$2.25, mug 40 cents), Friday (happy
hour, 3—7: tnixcd drinks 75 cents,
wincs 50 cents). and Sunday (3
Mutts for $l.00). llunyan and l
both agreed that between tltc
specials, the Marx Bros. pictttrcs
and Galaxittn, Harpo’s could

deﬁnitely be a future favorite bar.

The only problem was that we were

the only people in the bar. The r

bartender attributed this to the

special across the street at Ralph’s. ‘

After hearing this revelation, my
companion and I turned and looked

at each other and at the same time

repeated, "Ralph’s."

Approaching the corner of
Madison and New Scotland where
Ralph's is situated, we immediately
realized that this bar would be the
closest thing to the Long Branch or
the Lampost that we had been to
tonight. Upon - entering, we
discovered the whole length of the
bar filled with rowdy students and
townies. It seems that there was a
special that night, three Matts for a
dollar. Though there. were also
sotnc good specials (Monday small
pitchers of Bud, one dollar) and the
music wasn‘t too bad, we were very
disappointed with Ralph’s
resemblance to the more commer-
cial establishments that we had
spent all night trying to get away
from. It was not too long before
Bunyan and l were cruising once
again.

Turning the corner of Madison
and Lark street, that familiar feel:
ing which comes with over in-
dttlgcncc led me to pull over. My
red-faced companion who obvious-
ly was experiencing a similar sensa-
tiort, seemed bent on returning,
good article or_not. Feeling a bit
desperate, I began to plead with nty
mutinous first mate to rcconsidcr
and try just one more bar. All sccru-
cd lost, when out of the corner of
my eye, I spotted three very curiotts
looking characters stepping into a
rather unobtrusive looking

storefront. What was even more in-
tcrcstiug was that the name of the
bar was also its address. Since. even
tired old Bunyan saw some merit in
checking this place out, it was not
long before we found ourselves
walking down the concrete steps in-
to “288.” As we entered, we were
immediately impressed with the col-
orful crowd which seemed friendly,
casually dressed, but rather chic.
. Tltc interior was moderately sized,
' larger in length than in width, and
very tastcfttlly done. For .the
gtuncrs, there is a choice between
Space Invaders Deluxe and
Asteroids, around which there is
usually very little wait since most
patrons scented ralhcr disintcrestcd
with such distractions. Priced a bit

more expensive titan the average,
bottled beer 'was $l.20 and up,
drafts ran around 60 cents. 0n the
wholc, the atmosphere seemed very
pleasing — especially if you're into
New Wave. Ccrtaiitly 288 was the
most interesting bar we had been to.

As the hour slipped past two, my
companion and l conceded the
night and climbed out into the brisk
autumn night. The experience for
botlt of us had bccn bittersweet. ‘
Truly the perfect bar (like the foun-
tain of youth) seemed to be beyond
our rcaclt. However, in the process
of searching we had opened up new
frontiers, givirtg Bunyan a little bit
of hope and the author a chance for
it new series.
