Group Seeks Improved security

by Rose Herschberg

As a result of two recent attacks
against women in the downtown
area. a group of SUNYA students
and staff members have prepared a
petition seeking improved security
at the downtown campus.

The petition will be presented to--

day at 2:00 pm. to Vice President

' of Business and Finance John Har-

tigan iti President O'Leary’s
absence. The petition begun. cir-

culating this past Monday to
students. faculty and staff of the
downtown campus following the
rape of a woman this past Saturday.
and a previous incident on October
7.

Liane Davis. a teacher in the
School of Social Welfare and a
member of the lS-person commit-
tee, said the petition has eight
specific requests: improved lighting

in lots and walkways at Draper. a‘

 

full-time police ofﬁcer Sunday
through Thursday from 4:00-1 I :00,
installation of four direct line
phones, a student patrol posted at
the Western Avenue lot 15 minutes
before the start of evening classes.
self-defense workshops offered dur-
ing daytime hours. the locking of all
outside doors except those
designated, clusters of courses in
location and the scheduling of addi-
tional evening classes at the

downtown campus. aadtbepatrol;
ing and checking of buildings and
restrooms by security.

The'petitlon says that although
some of these requests have been
planned and others already initiated
(such as self-defense workshops and
some improved lighting), the group
feels that this is not sufficient.

“There are certain things we feel
the University should do for us.
There are other things we must do
for ourselves," Davis said. The
committee has instituted a Buddy
System to get students and faculty
safely to their cars and houses after
their evening classes.

 .The group aims to inform people
of potential dangersand to decrease
vulnerability. Therefore. they are
making demands to develop some
self-help mechanisms which are
‘self-maintaining to assure safety.

 

Reagan Adviser
Quits Post Due to.
Nixon Allegations <
WASHINGTON. D.C. (AP)

Richard V. Allen. long regarded as
' Ronald Reagan's choice for White

 

House national ‘security adviser. .
stepped aside Thursday from the
Reagan campaign staff as a result of
conflict of interest allegations
dating to his service in the Nixon
administration.

Edwin Meese. Reagan campaign
chief of staff. issued a statement
saying Allen has "withdrawn for
the remaining days of the campaign
to remove this matter as a possible
issue in the campaign."

Mecse also said "It is clear that
any allegation or implication of im-
proper conduct is tirilrtic. Mr. Allen
continues to have the full con-
fidence of Ronald Reagan and the
campaign organization."
