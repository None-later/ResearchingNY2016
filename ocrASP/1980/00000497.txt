October 31, 1980'
llvelt up

According to The. New York
Times, there's good news and bad
news regarding the human life span.

First, the bad news: The Times
reports that despite many decades
of medical research. science has
been virtually unable to extend the
normal humart life span past about
85 years.

The good news. however. is that
more and more people are living
healthier and active lives. right up
to the poirtt of death in their
mid-80’s. .

The Times says that if the current
medical trend continues. it seems
likely that most people of the future
wlto cart avoid death by accident
will live vigorous lich through their
mid-70's. After that, according to
tire newspaper. their health will
deteriorate rapidly and tltcy will
die.

sexual desire takes a dive

The l960‘s and the 1970's will be
remembered by many people as tltc
decade of the “Sexual Revolution‘.
The 1980's, however, may someday
be known as the era of the "Sexual
Blahs".

Dr. Evelyn Gendel is the director
of Human Sexuality at the Universi-
ty of California (in San Francisco).
And she says rltc most common
complaint being heard at sex clinics
across the country today is a grow-
ittg lack of sexual desire irr both
men and women.

Accor'ditig to Gendcl. the corn-
plrtint is coming frottt all age
gr'otrps,- and particularly front

couples who are "extremely busy"
and career oriented. '

Gendel says it may be that some
couples ltave a scheduling problem.
or that many are being distracted by
goals in their professions. Whatever
the cause. site says, sex clinics today
are being ﬂooded by patients who
say they no longer have the desire.

Here's good news for all you jog-

that runners actually get high and a
sense of well being from a drug that
is produced naturally by the body
during running. .

Dr. William Scholtcn of the
Bethesda Hospital and Mental
Health Center says that regular
rigorous exercise seems to stimulate
the body’s production of
“beta-endorpltin," which works
like a natural opiate.

Says Dr. Scholten: “it’s rare to
