.; Presidential ;

Hie following nine candidates for Presi-
dent appear on the New York State ballot:

t Carter

Jimmy Carter, the Democratic nominee.
cites as his highest domestic priority “the
need to guarantee a job for every American
who is able to work.” He endorses an im-
mediate 512 billion anti-recession program
to create at least 800,000 jobs.

Carter's energy policy is designed to
achieve a goal of 20 percent solar energy by
the year 2000. The Democratic platform
stresses conservation, and pledges to ‘_ ‘retire
nuclear power plants in an orderly man-
ner.” Caner .supports the Equal Rights
Amendment and opposes any constitu-

 

 

 

Ll ' ., “techonological and military
superiority over the Soviet Union." The
Republican platfor‘m states they will
“accepts no arms control agree-
.ment...which locks the U.S. into a position
,of military inferiority."

McCormack

The nominee of the Right to Life Party is
Ellen McCormack. who has concentrated
primarily on the abortion issue. speaking
out strongly against it. McCormack. a Long
lsland housewife. leads the party. which is
an offshoot of the Right to Life lobby
group. Dcpsitc pleas from Reagan. the par-
ty still nominated McCormack for president
rather than endorsing Reagan.

By running anti-abortion candidates. the
party not only guarantees the issue will not
be forgotten, but has an opportunity to

 

 

tional amendment banning abortion.

The Carter Doctrine states the intent to
repel aggression in the Persian Gulf by
“any means necessary. including military
force." Caner supports draft registration
of 19- and 20—year-olds. including women.
The Democratic platform supports the MX.
cruise. and Trident submarine missiles to
“help guarantee the invulncrability of otir
nuclear deterrent."

Reagan

Ronald Reagan. nominee of the
Republican and Conservative Parties. sup-

 

enact a three-year. 30 percent cut in per-
sonal income taxes. Reagan‘s energy policy
promotes production over conservation; he
also is in favor of the repeal of the windfall
proﬁts tax.

The Republican platform proposes to
revise “cumbersome and overly stringent
Clean Air Act regulations." and also ad-
vocates the increased use of nuclear power
and the development of breeder reactors.
Reagan opposes the ERA and abortion
rights. supponing a constitutional amend-
ment to protect “the right to life for unborn

"educate" the public. in addition. the par-
ty was unhappy with Reagan's record as
California governor (he signed the state’s
liberalized abortion law), his choice of a
running mate. and his lukewarm t‘ndorsc-
ment of a constitutional amendment
outlawing abortion.

Since the party supports amending the
constitution to outlaw all abortion. it con-
sidch congressional and legislative races ex-
tremely important because of the role Con-
gress and state legislatures play in amending
the U.S. Constitution.

Anderson

New York State Liberal Party nominee
John Anderson proposes a 50 cents per
gallon tax on gasoline in an effort to "cut
consumption and reduce our dependence
otvforcign supplies."

Anderson also supports the establish-
ment of a “youth opportunity wage.”
below minimum wage, that he hopes will in~
crease employment among teenagers. He
plans to increase U.S. productivity by
reducing the tax on savings account in-
terest. In addition, he hopes to spur invest»
ment by providing tax incentives. including

 

 iPteéidential and .Legis_lative-" Candidates

, a 10 percent tax credit for "research and
! development.”

Anderson is in favor of nuclear power,
but only with “adequate safeguards."

He supports the ERA and federally-
funded abortion.

Anderson is opposed to draft registra-
tion, and proposes to increase the volunteer
army by raising military pay. Anderson said
he "is not opposed to increasing defense
spending to meet real needs," but added,
“we must also examine the contribution to
our security of...energy research and
development. energy conservation,
materials research and development. space
exploration. and information processing."
Anderson opposes the MX missile. as it is
“highly cost inefficient." ‘

Clark

Free Libertarian. Ed Clark. is strongly in
favor of decreased military spending. Much
of his campaign deals with cuts and
decreases: a 50 percent cut in tax rates,
removal of government control on energy.
and abolishment of all restrictions on in-

 

dividual rights.

The Libertarians maintain that the
government's role in society should be sc-
cond to individual rights and freedoms. in
order to reach this goal. they advocate the
legalization of marijuana and the abolish-
ment of gun control laws. They sum up the
central theme of their views with the state-
ment that. all individuals have the right to
live in whatever manner they choose, so
long as they do not forcibly interfere with
the equal rights of others to live in whatever
manner they choose.

' H‘all

Gus Hall. the Communist Party can-
didate is an experienced politician. running
for the third timc as a presidential can-
didate. He claims that the party is growing
and that it offers solid proposals to meet
the needs of tlic pcoplc.

a six-hour work day without a pay cut,
federal takeover of closed plants under
democratic and community control and
conversion ofthese plants to useful produc-
tion. "

He also supports an emergency program
to create new jobs. renewal of job-creating
trade with the socialist countries. and the
slashing of the military budget to release
funds for jobs.

 

 

The majority of these proposals would
serve to create new jobs, which would lead
to less unemployment and more money in
the people’s pockets. This would lessen the
economic strain on the American people.
