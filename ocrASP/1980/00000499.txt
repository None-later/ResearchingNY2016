Bon Levy:

Zonker Harris

 

5 you walk into the booth this Tues-
A day. or as you check off the boxes
. on your absentee ballot, make sure
to look al the way down in the left side col-
umn. Look below Carter. below Reagan (his
name's printed twice so the old folks cart find
it), below Anderson and Hall and Com-
moner. and with a little imagination you will
see the box marked "Electors for Zonker
Harris."

i can think of no man more qualified for
the job of President than Doonesbury's own
child of society. Hi5 breadth and depth of
understanding of the world scene is well
renowned. He influences the goings on in
most of America's major Cities (as seen in
San Francisco in the Chronicle. Washington
in the Post, Albany in the Krtick News. to
name a few). He understands the American
scene froin Studio 54 to a par 3. and he can

mediate fluently in tongues *

 

 

 

such as Vietnamese and *

LlUl’dlilLiili.

From his tainpaign head g.
quarters at the back nine of k
l’ubble ﬂuir‘lt. Zonker to relax-
etl amid the fury of work going
on around him. You glance first ‘K
at this talm personage itlli/ ap-
plying the Bath tft‘ Stilt-ti. and *
then to the clutter that: en-
croaching upon his recliner. ¥
The walls are a jigsaw of nut-
worlt monitors and statistical
printouts. Desks are piled high
wtth magazines. newspapers, 1’ T
and the Sunday comics,

Harris is running a media
campaign; he will make no per- *
sonal appearances. even if
elected, His strategy was for-

mulated by his campaign
manager. known only as #-
Phred. in the wake of Richard __. '

Nixon's resignation. it was then
that Zonker and his cohorts ‘E
catapulted into national recognition without
uttering a word. Time. Newsweek. and even
Gerald Ford's press attache were suspended
in awe at this man's potential, Washington
dignitaries would detour from the first page
each morning to find out the opinion of the
town's most respected philosopher.

Zonker's list of credentials as a presidential
candidate. though almost non-existent. may
be better than any of his competitors. It
draws its roots from the Harris family tree
(His uncle, old Nate Harris. was a
Minuteman. fighting for freedom in 1776).
His political expertise out-shines all others
with his work as deputy governor of Samoa
for a threevweek episode.

One of the most critical poncems of
utodern day voters is whom their president
will choose as advisors. To quell any fears of
being an unknown in the political arena.
Zonker has chosen one of the most
respected personalities around as his
running-mate; none other than Michael
Doonesbury. Together. they make an
unbeatable 1-2 punch of confidence rind
credibility. Should they win in November.
the appointees to their cabinet Would in--
clude: '

 

Secretary of State — Uncle Duke. former
' governor of territorial Samoa.
former ambassador to China.
former Rolling Stone staffwrller.
Secretary of the Press —~ Roland Hedley.
‘ ctirreutly a news reporter for ABC
Secretary of the interior — Boopsie. B.D.'s
glfl.
Attorney General >~ Joanie Caucus, with
special assistant Rick Redfern.
Secretary of Agriculture — Jimmy Caner.

The platform of the Harris-for-l’resident
movement is. well, not finished yet. Zonker.
as they explained to me. hail to leave town;
the policeman who answered the phone said
something about a drug investigation.
Anyway. he has promised to_dellver it by no

  

later than 1983. (This could. ln fact, be a
wise political ploy; it's the issues that have
always made the candidates look their
sliIlest.)

ln throwing my support toward Harris. I
am not simply trying to avoid the absurdity of
the other choices. Zonker Harris Is not an
alternative; he is a realistic choice in the two-
dimensional environment that elections have
become.

He is an intelligent. perennial junior at
Yale. and he holds much respect for his
parents (who pay the bills). He will not try to
ply the public with a wonton waste of hand
liilltr and televised trash. He is simply making
an appeal to the reasonable. the foresighteil.
and the humorous.

Zonker llanis. fact or fiction. may be able
to do more for its tltan any other candidate.

meetings and a slew of other
things. I'm lucky if i remember to bathe. So
you can imagine my surprise when i found
out about this big election that's comirrg up.

Friends have been after me to support so-
meone.“lt's not so unreasonable." they nag.
Or worse: "It's your responsibility!"

Well. maybe they've got a point there.
Maybe ii is my responsibility to vote. After
all. if no one voted. there'd be no election,
And if there were no election . . .

No. I will vote. But there's )liSl one small
problem. After a brief assessment of the
political scenario. I realize that I don't care to
support any of the candidates who are runn-
tng, l've had enough of Carter's antics and
liypoCrlsy. He's already shown what he can
do in office. And as for that Bonzo fellow
. . . l can't believe that any third rate actor
will improve with age. no sir. And that in-
dependent: I say any mart who'd leave Yes
iii a time of crisis won't do much better in the
White House.

So what are my options. l ask as a con-
cerned American? I can vote for a minority
party ~— say. the Socialist party  but ltow
could I rationalize that to my father. an
lBMer? He'd lose his pension or something.
No. it's not worth it.

i see why democracies usually (all. it's not
easy selecting one of the most powerful peo-
ple in the World. It's a big decision and lately
my biggest decisions have been whether to
sit in the balcony or on the floor.

situation I feel i must. Please forgive me, oh
my brothers (and sisters). but here goes. Life
Is a game of chance. There. i said it. But I
also mean it. Every action has a reaction.
every cause has an effect. every decision has
a consequence. and so on. You've simply
got to pay for what you do.

Unfortunately for all of us eligible voters.
this concept of chance has. as one of its ma
jor examples, the farce which we call
"Election '80." Yes. we all know that this
year the Super Bowl is a tossaip between
Grits and Uncle Bonao. so who really cares
which one it is? l mean no disrespect to these
"giants" of politics. 1 am merely trying to

crises. They should be wise and sincere: be
aware of their constituents' needs. We gotta
be able to trust these guys or we're up that
proverbial creek. sans oars.

Personally. I'd like to see a woman try for
it. Unfortunately. there don't seem to be any
around who are qualified/crazy enough. l
know what you're thinking: l'm one of those
who wants to see women in higher office just
for the sake of having women In higher of-
fice. For the record. I'd like to see women in
positions where they'd be candidates for as
much criticism and abuse as their male
counterparts. because men won't be able to
treat women as equals until they can hate
them equally. (Close quote.)

dorse anyone. he's got to be sensitive to my

I've decided. But first. let me acknowledge
my tremendous influence on the student

does anything around here without my ap-
proval. l appreciate that. guys. So, with that
out of the way, let me announce my can-

of America. He's a man who's perennially
proven his good judgment; who's establish-
ed an outstanding rapport with millions of
Americans; who‘s revealed his sincerity a
thousand times over. My candidate is a man
to whom the political limelight is nothing
new. My candidate shares something special
with Harry Truman. Yes, it's true. In this
campaign of 1980. l'm endorsing the Duke

For this year's third party candidate. we
have (in this corner) John Anderson. Well.
when Johnny came to sing to us on the
podium. he came equipped withsome of the
most perfect caricatures of secret service
men I had ever seen. Better than in the
movies. The Albany school band. which
entertained the crowd. blasted out the theme
from Hogan's Heroes. and then played the
fitting tune “That's Entertainment” )ust‘
before Johnny's entrance. John joked about
how sunny it was outside. quoted Bob Dylan
(I guess he's hip and groovy). and used
metaphors (“stinging each other like a cou-
ple of tarantulas in a bottle") to get his point
across. Sorry. Johnny.

With the exception of Barry Commoner (a
viable name-candidate for the Citizens Party.
who is trying to help establish a very worthy
tltirtl choice for future elections). we are left

lngmainly to get a point across.

“TE-Koch. 105th mayor (since

 
  
   
  

‘V‘ ‘V‘ ‘V‘ ¥ ¥ 4 4 ‘V‘ 4 4 44 January. 1978) of the City of

New York. He's popular. charismatic.
tough. energetic. and fun. He's also not
afraid to admit to mistakes. He gives his best
effort to making sure that most. if not all at-
tempts are made to cure what he feels is the
most vital problems of his beloved city. Most
important here is that Ed Koch's best efforts
are not to be taken lightly.

Koch. as mayor. has gone through a lear»
ning process. Through his efforts. he has
been able to increase police patrol strength in
the city two and a half times. has greatly
reduced New York's welfare cost. and has
made propositions to help all the ills of the
Big Apple. What he‘s found is that although
a tight ship is commendable, it does not
guarantee better efficiency. He‘s also found
that getting things done is not so simple
when you're met with opposition from all
sides. ,
'But he does try. very hard. And he does
succeed. First off. running the city of New
York is an Incredible "bitch" (to quote some
fitting slang). To want the )ob you have to be
a glutton for punishment; but to attempt it
and yield any reasonable amount of success,
you've got to be one of the best. Koch is Just
that — and more. He has restored com-
petence. Integrity, and a new - sense of
leadership to (dare i say) American govern-
ment,

1 don't know how many of you will actual-
ly listen to my points and vote for Koch.
Lord knows l'm tempted (even though the
mayor himself would probably urge me to
vote for his party's candidate). However. as
of now l'm still undecided. But good luclt,
Ed. l'lI probably end up on your side because
l'm too scared to look at consequences of a
possible “two-party choice." Either way. i.
can tell you one thing for sure. "l-iow'm i
doin'?", your favorite urging for public
response, is not only amusing, but also
represents your concern for us all —— and
that's important. By the way. I've got an
answer for you. Ed. "You're doln' line. Mr.
