She said, “I am shocked at the
depths of discrimination in the
country. It is evidenced when we br-
ingour cases to court and under the
14th amendment the judge says a
woman is not considered a person.
We need an ERA amendment to en-
sure our personage."

In an effort to enlighten and rally
the support of the audience, Abzug
explained exactly what the ERA
was not. “The ERA will not force
homemakch out into the job
market, interfere with the family
structure, and for those who take

Her raspy Bronx ‘acccnt got

will do is provide a standard for'
judges to use as a guideline, it will
aid the enforcement of other laws
on the book already, such as the
equal pay law, and it will place a
monetary value on the work done
by homemakcrs." '
.From‘ here, Abzug went on
to bring up the very sensitive sub-

“But whatever your opinion iso'n
abortion, the ERA has-nothing to
do with that law. The abortion laws
have already been established using.
the existing amendments. The mix- '
ing up of these two feminist issues is
e manipulation device used by those
who employed the mentality ‘that it
is a sin to vote and voting will
destroy God and country' during
the Women’s Suffrage. Move-
ment," said Abzug.

With disgust in her voice. Abzug
asked. "How come thE'Tnoment
we're protected, we're protected
from our own rights? The ERA is
not going to draft women, but the
President and Congress are.
Women have always been -in the
military and have historically died
for this country. And if there is a
national emergency we will be
mobilized together."

She added, “And whether or not
we'll go into combat is irrelevant
because the next war will be a highly
technological one. This question is
being used as a red herring."

for change. She told the story of
Representative Millicent Fcnwick
(N.J.) out on the floor arguing in
favor of the ERA, being told by a
male representative that women
should be "huggablc, kissablc, and
swcct smelling.” Fcnwick agreed,
saying she expected the same of
men and that she hoped he wasn’t
disappointed as often as she was.

As the audience chccrcd, she
said, ‘-'All my stories have a point.
And the point here is that women's
liberation means men's liberation.
It means that both,scxcs will share
equally in creating a better society.

“Women want a chance to be in
the power structure to have some of
that power that has been tradi-
tionally allotted to men. We have to
struggle and say to men 'You
haven’t dotrc that well with the
power you have’," said Abzug.

With a chuckle she added, “it's
just that we haven’t had a chance to
be corrupted by power and we want
it."

Confidcntly. she said, “As
women we have always been con-
ccrncd with social problems and
