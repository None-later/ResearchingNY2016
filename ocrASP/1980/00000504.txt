Lynn Burton led the Albany
State women‘s soccer team with two
goals in their victory over Vassar on
Wednesday. 3-].

Albany capitalized on acrucial
mistake for their ﬁrst score. Albany
center Lisa France was tripped front
behind by a Vassar defender in the
penalty area, and she banged the
penalty shot home.

Burton took care of the rest of
the Dane scoring. Her first goal

r came on a beautiful shot from the

far right side. just outside tltc penal-
ty box. A crossing pass set up

‘Albany's ﬁnal goal. Burton's shot
grazed off a Vassar fullback and
slid. into the goal.

“it was a very good game," said
Albany women’s soccer coach Amy
Kidder. Kidder thought the team
played very well, both offensively
and defensively. She was particular-
ly pleased with Albany's passing
and sharing of the ball, especially
during the second half.

In the ﬁrst half, Vassar bunched
a lot of their players on the ball,
forcing Albany to cover thehl, but
"during tlte second half we settled '
down and played our style," accor-

.Pag'e‘Flfteen-

Women Boater-S Trip Vassar,341

fdlng to Kidder. .

Albany's biggest problem during
the game was that, with w mlnutes
left to play, the sun began to set.
“Even though we had a comfor-
table lead we had to be careful
because our goalie couldn't see the
ball." said Kidder.

The darkness caused the Danes to
play more cautiously. “We had to
play more defensively because we
couldn't control the ball —— we
couldn't see it." France said.

The hooters next game is tomor-
row against Springfield College at
11:00.

Bills Playing With A Hot Hand

ORCHARD PARK. N.Y. (AP) En
route to six victories in eigltt games
this year, the Buffalo Bills have
disposed of perennial playoff teams
and National Football League also-
tans.

in the Atlanta Falcons, however,
Coach Chuck Knox finds a Na-
tional Conference reflection of his
own squad — a young team playing
with a hot hand and nothing to lose.

it's a vision that comes as close as
anything to frightening Knox.

"This is the most aggressive
team we‘ve seen this year." lte said.
“They pose quite a challenge to our
defensive team with two runners
William Andrews and Lynn Cain
who have combined for more than
1,000 yards this s'cason. Plus Steve
Bartkowski is having a super year."

“They're just a doggone good.
solid. tough, hard-nosed football
team."

NFC West and the Bills of the
American Conference East. it also
involves enough interpersonal rela-
tionships for a soap opera.

"We've been close friends a long
time." Atlanta Coach Lecman Ben‘
nett said of Knox. “I was his
graduate assistant at the Universtiy
of Kentucky irl I961. But I tltink
those special kinds of feelings ltavc
to take a back seat to tile impor-
tance of the ball game."

Bennett, who was a Knox assis-
tant at Los Angeles for four years.
coached llte Falcons twice against
his former mentor in 1977 NFC
West games. Tlle year also marked
the second and last meeting between
the Bills and Falcons, Buffalo won
both times.
