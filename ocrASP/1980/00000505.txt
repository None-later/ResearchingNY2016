He feels that Herman's main ad-
vantage lies in his strategical
abilities. ‘fHe's very clever — he
has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. He
enjoys tricks, Tricks win a lot of
wrestling matches,” noted DeMeo.

“He's only a sophomore." he ad-
ded. “it all depends on how fast he
gains the experience. it's all up to
Vic —— he has no limitations in terms
of his ability."

Several other veterans will be
returning this season. Seth Zameck,
a two year letterman, will be wrestl-
ing'at 1 l8 pounds and DeMeo looks
toward him and Warren Wray to
emerge as strong team leaders.
Wray will go to the mats in the 126

pound weight class. _

Spero TheofiiatOs will return‘ at
142 pounds and Bill Papazian will
give it a go at 150. Papazianhas
been out with injuries for the last
two years and his return should add
some stability to the lineup. ‘-‘He's a
very experienced wrestler," noted
DeMeo.

Dave Straub and Len Guzman-

will be back in the 15.8 pound class
rind then would normally come
what DeMeo calls his “Murderer's

' Row"‘ — Kronen, Hornbach, and

Herman. Then in the heavyweight
division comes Mark Goossens and
Tim McGowan.

“Those are the guys we‘expect a
great deal from. With the freshmen
we should field a stronger team

’ than last year. How strong depends

on how injury free we are and how
the freshman develop," observed
DeMeo.

DeMeo speaks with pride when
he talks about his new recruits.
“Our freshman look to give us a lot
of strength. As a group, we have
one of the strongest freshman teams
on the East coast," DeMeo said.

Leading the _ pack is Andrew
Seras. Scras is a two time National
AAU champion from Niskayuna
High in Schenectady and placed
fourth in the World championships.
“i have got to expect a lot of
outstanding things from him," said
DeMeo.

Bill Andres will try to break in at
,l42 pounds. Andres was the winner

of the Olympic 200 Project and run-
ner up in the World High School
Championships. “We expect some
really great years from him," com-
mented DeMeo. v
Rounding out the talented corps
are Tim Blake. Ed Gleason, Bruce
Buchanan, Barry Barnes, and Dan
Jeran. The youngsters-should be
tested very early as the grapplers
face possibly their toughest

schedule ever, according to DeMeo. '

They‘ll be facing four top Division i
schools including Syracuse, who
DcMeo expects to be in the top

three in the nation

The Danes compete in the very
difficult SUNY Athletic Conference
(SUNYAC), which DeMeo says is
“Definitely the number one con-
ference in the country." There are
nine schools in the conference and
seven of these were in the top 29 in
the nation last year and four were in

the top ten. Brockport was the Na-
tional Champion and Binghamton,
Cortland. and Oswego are all high
calibre schools. Albany was sixth
last year.

“We're open to move up in
SUNYAC's but so much depends
on our young guys. it depends on
how much experience they can get
in one season. We have the capabili~
ty on paper, and if you dream a lit-
tle bit, we can do pretty well," said
DeMeo. ,

The wrestling season begins

tomorrow for Albany with the

Great Dane Wrestling Classic in
University Gym. Matches will start
at ":00 and continue all day.

Last year the Classic was- the
largest tournament. on the East
coast with 238 entrants representing
over 20 teams. This year such highly
regarded teams as Syracuse, Boston
University, Rhode island. and the
University of Massachusetts will be
competing.

“it's going to be a great tourna-
ment. Aim of really strong Divi-
sion i and it as well as Division iii
schools will be here," said DcMco.
“i’m hoping we can win a lot of
matches, but i don't know if we'll
win any weight classes with our in-
experience. it's touch and go."

DeMeo said the the tournament is
going to be a "Marathon Match."
Some of the wrestlers will have
eight or nine matches with breaks
that will seem to get shorter and
shorter as the day wears on.

“The winner will have to be not
only a real good wrestler, but a rca|~
ly tough hombre. it's a real test,"
noted DeMeo.

This Season should be a real test
for the young Dane team. but
DeMeo is hopeful. “Our future is
just outstanding. We have just a
great group of recruits," he said.
"My goal with my team is to even-
tually be good enough to win the
NCAA‘s. Certainly this team has
the athletes with the potential, bttt
potential is u very difficult thing.
We still might be a few years
away.”

October 31, 1980

by Marc Haspel

As the Albany State soccer team
journeyed across the Hudson River
Wednesday en route to RPl, one
aim had to be firmly etched in each
player’s mind besides just winning
the game. Albany ' was con-
cerned about earning a place in the
NCAA playoff tournament.
Against the 4-7 Engineer team, a
Dane win might have been ex-
pected. in fact, as Albany soccer
coach Bill Schieffelin pointed out
after the game, “on arty given day,
we’re four goals better than RPi.“

' But for Albany this was not “any

given day.”

instead, it was a day of frustra-
tion as the Danes dominated the err-
tire game but came up a goal short,
losing 2-1. “We dominated the
play. it was easy to sec who the bet-
lertcam was." said Albutty forward
Afrim chaj.

if the Danes really were the better
team on this day. then it was the
work of one man that denied them
the witr — Rl’i gozrlkccper Edward
lyzrnov. According to Schlcl'l'clitr,
he played “unbelievably.” All

garlic long, the Engineer kccpcr :

stopped shots that should have been
goals. He kept the Dane ofl'cnsc,

which effectively set up many scor- ’
ittg opportunities, in check the en—
.

tire afternoon.

“it was frustrating, we shot cvcry
five seconds but nothing went in."
said New]. “The goalie had the
greatest game of any l'vc seen."

Tltc three goals of the game till
took place in the first half. After
five minutes of somewhat sluggish
play on the part of botlt learns, the
Engineers drew first blood. In

'to come out and make a stop. The
RPl goal that resulted closed out
the day's scoring with the Engineers
in the lead 2-].

The second half proved more
frustrating for the Danes than even
the first. Offensively, the Danes
constantly took many shots-on-goal
but were being denied every time by

e Danes seemed a bit
“suspicious,” according,to Schief-
felin, in the opening half, so he
surcd it up by bringing Arango back

'to the fullback position. Clearly,

Albany outplayed RPi, but‘ on the
scoreboard, the one goal difference
remained and Albany lost.

“No matter what we tried out
there, it wasn’t successful. i don't
know how we lost the game,"
Schieffelin commented.

.This disheartening loss certainly

m will dim Albany's chances of receiv-
, ing a NCAA playoff bid. But the
‘ team will get one last chance to
_ redeem itself on Saturday against

Kean College. Kean is a good team.

' Division iii. if the Danes do really

well against the New Jersey school,
may be able to prrt
themselves back into main conten-
tion for a tournament bid.

“i hope we win Saturday, we still
ltuvc a chance for a bid," said

New}.

 

Still, for the 7-4-1 Danes, who
were ranked third rrmong Division
iii tennis in New York State prior

, to Wednesday, the playoff picture

is not as bright as it was just a few
days ttgo. “Conceivably, this loss
could have put us out of the tourna-
ment." admitted Schieffelin.

But considering that the bids will
be offered curly next week. Schicf—
fciirt added. “We didn't have 'any

 

luck today. We have to look to

 

 

The men's varsity soccer team‘s chances of earning in bid in the NCAA playoff tournament were dimmed
with \\'erint~stlrry‘s 2-] loss to Rl’i. The Albany huoters' record now stands at 7-4-l.
