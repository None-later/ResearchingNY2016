chout. “One thing we’re concerned
about is the inverted safety,"
Reynolds said. “That would cut-
number us on the corner." But
Reynolds commented that such a
switch would challenge Albany to
throw into a undermanncd secon-
dary. “From what we've seen.
they've got poor pass drops," he
said of the Saxon linebackers who
would be responsible for the short
zones where the Albany passing
game is concentrated. “By looking
at them," Reynolds continued, “we
can run our normal package."

Starting center Mike Arcuri will
miss action because of a sprained
knee suffered in last week's game,
and leading rushcr Chuck I’riorc
will be forced to play with his hand
heavily padded due to a broken
bone that also occurred against
Norwich.
