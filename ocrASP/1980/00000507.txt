When the Danes take the field
tomorrow against 6-1 Alfred ,
University. there are a few things
that will no doubt be sticking in
their minds. One is the performance
of the offense. Last week at Nor-
wich. the Albany wishbone sput-
tered for its lowest output of the
year by over 100 yards (164 total of-
fense). and its most ineffective day
since the early season 6-2 loss to
Southern Connecticut. The passing
game that has been more of a
weapon this season than in past
years faltered (Dane quarterbacks-
were good on one of ,11 passes
against Norwich). Alfred’s defense
can be deadly against the run, and
at times almost dares their opposi-
tion to pass. Albany will be forced
to get that throwing touch back if it
is to win. ‘ a

ability to bounce back after a tough
defeat. Last Saturday's contest was
'an emotional one. and a difficult
one to drop. in. 1979 when the
Danes were defeated by lthaca in'
mid-season. they hit the skids, and
lost three iii a row. Tomorrow will
be a test for them in that respect.
“i think we’ll bounce back," said
Albany head football coach Bob

 

Ford. “1 think we've got great
character. We did some things that
they (the team) don't feel good
about and i don't feel good about,
‘but 1 think we’ll bounce back."
.Alfred is a team that can make
that difﬁcult. The Saxons boast a

Another concern is Albany's

back Bob Schuster. Out of the
wing-t alignment. the 6-2, 210
pound signal-caller has connected

touchdowns.

Washington (AP) Ronald Reagan

startling latrdslidc that changed tltc
face of American government.
Carter promised Reagan his "fullest
support and cooperation" in the
transition to Republican rule.

"1 am not frightened by what lies

"and 1 don't ltclicyc tltc American
people are frightened by what lies

“'l‘ogcthcr, we're going to do

“We‘re going to ptrt American buck

The polls were still open itr tltc

As his electoral vote total soured,
