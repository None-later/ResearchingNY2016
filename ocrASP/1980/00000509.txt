Let me just say first ofall this has

I would have been not only
humbled by the extent of what has

been the cliffhanger that all of us I
think were expecting, it would have
been the same way — but just to

I consider the trust that you have
placed in me sacred and I give you
my sacred oath that I will do my ut-
most to justify your faith.

Together, we are going to do
what has to be done. We're going to
put America back to work again.

You know, I aim to try and tap
that great Amcrican spirit. that
opened up this completely
undeveloped continent from coast
to coast and made it a great nation,
survived several wars, survived the
Great Depression, and we‘ll surviva

I asked for your prayers at that mo-

All I can say to all of you is thank
you, ahd thank you for more than
just George Bush and myself, thank
you because if the trend continues,
we may very well control one house

quarter of a century.

President Carter Leaves Sadly, Gracefully

Here is the text of President
Carter's concession speech,
delivered Tuesday night:

I promised you four years ago
that I would never lie to you, so I
can’t stand here anti say it doesn't
hurt. _

The people of the United States
have nrade their choice, and of
course I accept their decision, but I
have to admit not with the same crr-
tlrusiasm that I accepted the deci-
sion four years ago.

I might say I have it deep up-
prcciation of the system, however,
that lets people make a free choice
about who will lead them for the
next four years.

About an hour ago, I called

We‘ll have rt very fine transition

New York (AP) Their own state
Republican party didn't support
them at first. But Alfonse
D'Amato, a political upstart, and
Ronald Reagan ended up with their
own sweet victories in New York
State anyway.

supervisor who billed himself as the
candidate of the "forgotten middle
class," Tuesday captured the US.

u Reagan, D

I have been blessed as only a few
people ever have to help shape the
destiny of this nation.

In that effort, l‘vc had your
faithful support. In some ways, I'vc
been the most fortunate of all
presidents because I've had the (Jill'-
ly aid of a wise man and a good
titan at my side, in my judgment the
bcsl vice president anybody ever
had, Fritz Mondale.

I‘ve not achieved all I set out to
do. Perhaps no one ever docs, but
we have faced the Iotrglr issues.

We‘ve stood for and we've
fought for and we have achieved

some very important goals for our’

country. These efforts will not end
with this administration.

He squcakcd out a narrow vic-
tory over Democratic Rep.
Elizabeth Holtzman to oust the
76-year—old Javits in the three-way
contest. Iavils, who ran on the
Liberal Party line, had been the
underdog in tire race ever since he

lost to D'Amato in the GOP
primary.
Reagan, once considered too

conservative for New York by tile
GOP political hierarchy, soundly
put that idea to rest with 21 margin

The effort must go on. Nor will
the progress that we have made he
lost when we leave office.

The great principles that have
guided this nation sincc‘its very
founding will continue to guide
America to the challenges of the
future.

This has been a long and hard-
I'ought campaign as you well know.
Iiut wc rrrtrst come together as a
united and a unified people to solve
the problems that are still before us,
to meet the challenges of a new
decade. And I urge all of you to
join in with me in a sincere and
fruitful effort to support my suc-
cessor when Ire undertakes this
great responsibility as president of
the greatest nation on Earth.

Campaigners Comment on Presidential Election Results

by Susan Mllllgrrn

The mood at Albany County
Republican headquarters was
justifiably optimistic, although
somewhat restrained, wlrcn Carter
conceded at approximately to p.m.
last night. Albany Courin
Republican Comnrittcc Chair
George Scaringc remarked that
“(Albany) County has been solidly
Democratic since I974 —— I am en-
courang by the fact that we have

elected a Republican President.
A News FEATURE

"We have put Watergate behind
us for good," he said. “I hope the
Republicans can become encourag-
ed again rally around the
Republican Committee."

Scaringc said Ire thinks it is possi-
ble, given that a conservative trean
in the country was reﬂected in many
levels of the election, that Albany
Republicans can “rebuild the city
of Albany . . . and eventually break

the Democratic machine.

“We just have to pick it apart
spot by spot," he added.

Scaringc noted that last year‘s
figures state 42,000 Republicans in
the Albany County, as opposed to
72,000 Democrats.

Scaringe said Ire thought
Reagan’s major support came from
the “silent majority" of middle
Americans as well as “those who
are very concerned about our na~
tional defense.

"Tire weakness in our defense
was clearly shown by our inability
to get the hostages out of Iran," he
said. “People havelost faith in Jim-
my Cartcr's ability to run the coun-
try."

The Committee Chair said he
does not think that inner conflicts
-—— such as the controversy over the
ERA in the drawing up of the par-
ty’s platform — will weaken the
Republican Party.

“The ERA -—~ and other issues ——
arevtliings that can be worked out

among the party leaders. I don‘t see
a fight," Ire said.

Scaringc added finally that he
sees a successful future for the
Republican Party nation-wide.

"People are concerned with what
will happen to them," he said.
"People are fed up with the way the
country is being run. The
Republican Party is not dead; it I.‘
alive, and it offers a viable alteri
native to the Democratic Party." *

The atmosphere was sullen at
best at 79 State Street, Democratic
Headquarters. Albany Mayor
Erastus Corning was clearly
rcnrorseful, remarking that he “has
tremendous respect for the Presi-
dent, and was very sorry to see him
defeated." Corning admitted to
voting straight Democrat in every
race.

Corning said that "it has been an
Interesting election. and very ex-
citing," but added that lie “was

i very surprised by the results."

The Mayor said that lit: “doesn‘t
think the hostage situation had
anything to 'do with Carter's
defeat," and added he “didn't
think it would have made much ofa
difference if the hostages had been
released before the election."

Corning said he “doesn't even

remember" the last time a
Republican carried the city of
Albany.

"I am sad to a certain degree,"
Corning admitted. “I am surprised
at the support D'Amato had. I had
no feeling this Reagan thing would
be as big as it is."

Although they were never really
in the race —— or perhaps simply
because they knew they were never
in the race, the Citizens Party was
having quite a party as the election
results rolled in, Campaign Chair
Mike Ireland, although noting that
Ire “was very surprised and ex-
tremely disappointed" at Reagan's
.victory, seems to feel that Citizens

Party Presidential Barry Corn-
mcner made a significant effect on
the election in idealistic terms.

“Whatever the percentage ends
up to be, the message is clear-cut,”

’hc said. “We are going to force
other candidates to address the
issues and we aren’t going to stand
for the bullshit.

“We will draw attention to the
issues," he continued. “We will not
allow ourselves to be absorbed into
the major parties."

Ireland said he feels that
Reagan’s election will spur revolt -—-
or at least opposition to various
issues, especially where students are
concerned.

“Carter has whipped up war
hystcﬂa, Carter has pushed registra-
tion, and I believe that Reagan will
institute a draft," he said. "The
draft is an issue that deﬁnately hits
home." , '

Reagan spoke against a
