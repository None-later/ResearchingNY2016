After that. the campaign got
rough.

D’Amato set out to proclaim
himself a- conservative and paint
Javits as a liberal out of step with an
increasingly conservative
Republican Party.

But he also hit hard on what
came to be known as the “age and
health" issue. Javits. 76. had an-
nounced that he was suffering from
a dcgcncralivc disease that would
limit his walking.

“You take a look at the guy. and
you tell me if he'll last six more
years." D' Arnalo said. The point
was pounded in D‘Amato's com-
nrcrcials. which said Javits was "76
and in failing health.“

presidential election year since
I948.

In late returns. D'Amato had 45
percent of the vote. compared to
Ms. Holtzman's 44 percent. and .
Javits' ll percent. Both Ms.
Holtzman and Javits appeal to
liberal-lo-moderatc voters, and
Javits may have drained away from
Ms. Holtzman support she would
have gotten if Iic had dropped out
of the race as many liberal voices

Similarly. Independent John
