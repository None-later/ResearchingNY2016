“The key was. our passing."
Sanders said. "Our receivers came
up with some blg‘catehes to keep
some drives alive."

“1 don't think the score was any
indication of the closeness of the
two teams." noted Ford.

The play was close throughout
most ofthc game. and Alfred's only
real domination came in the second
and fourth quarters. That's when
the Saxon ball-control offense took
over. in the second period. Alfred
had the ball for 10:35, while the
Danes had it for only 4:25. In the
ﬁnal quarter. the hosts had posses-
sion for 10:04 to Albany’s 4:56.
This put strain on the defense
because it must spend the majority
of the game on the licld. and that
wears them down. “i think people
started to get tired." Wierzbicki
said. Alfred had the ball a total of
13:14 longer than Albany and.
besides forcing the defense into ex-
tra duty. it puts the offense into a
catch-up situation. And the Dane
wishbone is not geared for catchvup
football.

But there were other statistical
differences that titust have the

Classic

“l'm really happy about how the
team did iii the tournament and I'm
optimistic about the year.“ said
Herman. “i think this year the team
is riiticli improved over last year.
We should do better iii SUNYACs
this year."

“The future looks good," agreed
DcMco. “We still have two tour-
initncnts to get us ready for the first
round of dual meets this year."

The Danes will be corrtpctitrg in
tlic Colgate Open this weekend and
then the (‘orning invitational on
November 14-15. They then face
Oncontzr. Union, and RH at RPl
on November 26. Their first major

Danes concerned. Alfred had 29
first downs in the ballgame (17 in
the air). and ran off a total of 91 of-
fensive plays. Albany had 14 ﬁrst

. downs and only 60 plays. Although

the Danes had an adequate 235
yards~ in total offense, the glaring
fact lies in their 134 yards on the
ground. Pratt was Albany’s leading

rushcr with 33 yards on 14 carries. ‘

Louis was next with 23 yards in“
attempts. Ford said before last
week that be doubted if Albany
would be able to run inside on
Alfred's 4-3 defense. He was right.

there is an opening-inside. Priore,
Albany's money back and leading
rusher on the season, only got the
ball six times for 20 yards, in-
dicating the strength of Alfred’s in-
terior coverage.
The win pushed Alfred’s record
to 7-], while Albany is dropped to
. an even 44, with two games to go.
“We know their defense and the
philosophy of it, and wejust attack-
ed the defense." Sanders conclud-
ed. "We feel we just beat a real
good team today. I think they (the
Danes) are the best 4-4 team in the
country."

All-SWAa

Monday afternoon, the once playoff bound men's varsity soccer‘
team ended its season on a sweet note with a 6-0 sheilacking of Vassar
College. The win was nice. but it was hardly the big news of the day.
The big news took place in Binghamton. where Albany men‘s soccer
coach Bill Schicffclin was attending a SUNYAC conference meeting.
At that meeting, one piece of business that was taken care of was the

all-conference teams. For Albany.

gOalkecpcr Alberto Giordano. forward Afrim Neraj, and fullback

of otlter players from the SUNYAC

Eastern Conference to which Albany belongs. The remaining schools
in that conference are Binghamton. Oneonta. Platlsburgh. Potsdam
and Cortland. A team comprised of players from the Western
SUNYAC Conference was also announced.

“We had three of the first l2 choices and that‘s 25 percent of the

“it's very representative."
Giordano. who tied Oneonta‘s John

Byrnc for the first team position. A Dane veteran. ltc had to miss most
of the lust half of the season as lie was sidelined with a knee injury. But
his early per'l‘orrrtances, including three shut outs against Oswego,
l’lattsburglr, and Sicna earned ltirtt the post-season ltonor. ,

Schicl'fclin had figured upon chaj‘s all-conference candidacy from
the very outset of this season. The Dane forward. who scored twice
against Vassar itt Monday‘s final game. led all Albany scorers with
eight goals on the year. Nezaj's aggressive style of play on both ends of
the field established ltittt as a bonafidc team leader.

At tltc beginning of this season. Scltieffelin was somewhat skeptical

owcver. Arango. along with Keith

Falconer. effectively shut down opposing offenses. Never did Dane

times against Albany. and only once

did the tottil get that high (against Division 1 Hartwick). iir fact.
