Boater Playoff Hopes Die Despite 1-1 Kean Tie

by Marc Haspel ‘

How quickly things change. One
week a team can be right in the mid-
dle of playoff contention and the
next week that same team can be
totally out of it. Such was the
fateful plight of the Albany men's
varsity soccer team.

last one week ago. the Danes

V' .Gqﬁ‘ r

  

were ranked third among Division
iii teams in New York State. This
team sccmcd headed for a bid in the
upcoming NCAA playoff tourna-
mcnt. Then. after one loss to the
4-7-1 RPi Engineers last Wednes-
day. those playoff chances suddenly
diminished. Still. the Danes wcrc
hopeful that a good performance

against Kean College. the number
ﬁfteenth-ranked Division iii team
in the nation. would be enough to

I send the bootcrs to the tournament.

The Danes did get a good perfor-
mance. tying Kean H, but it was
not enough.

On Sunday night. the NCAA’s
official selections for thc tourna-
ment wcrc announced and Albany
was not one of tlrenr. The four New
York state bids that were awarded
went to Cortland. Einghamton.
Clarkson and Buffalo in that rank‘
irrg order.

“The RP] game hurt us." said
Albany men‘s soccer coach Bill
Schicffclin, “If we would have won
that game. there would not have
been any problcnr getting in."

On Saturday, prior to the an-
nourrccrrrcrrl of tournament par-
ticiprtnts by the NCAA. the
burners. realizing the possible con-
scqucnccs of their most rcccrtt
dei'crtt trgrrinst Ri’l, took on Kcan at
home. Unlike the RM match. this
game was played just ih one would
have cxpcctcd it to be. No surprises.
rro rrpscls. no unbelicvablc in-
dividual efforts ~ just one tough
battling physical soccer match.

“it “its rt wry physical gamc.
wlrcn you want to win you can‘t sit
around and play dead." said
Schicii'clin.

During the opcning minutes of
plrry. rlrc Dunes worked well in the
nudficlrl illitl penetrating Kcan‘s

zone. .lcrry Isaacs and Leslie Severe
controlled much of the action. The
first Dane scoring opportunity of
the day came as Luis Arango shot a
bullet that hit the goal post.

On defense, the Danes played
very cohesively. Goalkeeper Billy
Steffen turned in another excellent
afternoon. Midway through the
half Steffen came up with a nice
save on .a shot off the foot of
Kcan's biggest threat of the game.
Richard Scarchwcli.

Other Danes also contributed to

tight defense. Afrim chaj was-

movcd back from his usual offen-
sive role to add extra support.
Many times during the course of the
contest, chaj’s headers cleared the
Danes out of trouble. Forward
Dominic Cadet did a fine job com-
ing back on defense and made some
nict.‘ plays to stifle Kean attackers
including a pretty slide to knock a
ball away from a Kctrn player.

Ironically. though, it was a
defensive mistake that allowed
Kcan‘s only goal of the day. Keith
Falconer. who othcrwisc had a fine
day. accidcrrtiy kickcd the ball off it
pass front Stcffcn. onto the fool of
Scarcirwcll who scored unassisted.
"I threw it to Kcith (Falconer) and
he kicked it to Sctrrclrwcll. so I tried
to conic out and stop it. brrt Ill: roll-
cd it by me." said Steffen.

Tire goal came late ill the half at
37:]6. and whcn the clock ran out.
Kcun lcd 1-0.

The play of the second half was
nearly identical to that of the ﬁrst
it was a very physical forty-five
minutes of soccer without many
shots-on-goai (seven for each
team). 4

The roughness turned ugly when
Steffen was kicked in the back of
the head by Kean's Paul Samson
after the keeper apparently had
possession of the ball on the
ground. A scufﬂe followed with a
few punches being thrown. When
things were finally restored to
order, two players were ejected.

At 20:i0 of the second half. the
Dancscvencd the score. chaj took
a high shot off a pass from Gus
Rakus to tie the. game at one a
piece.

Albany had other Chances during
the half but could not connect on
any of them. chcrc was stopped on
a break and VItrdo Scrgovich’s two
low shots were built saved by the
Kean keeper. Mark Hanrulak.

Also. on the other side of the
field. Stcffcrr was continuing his
consistent play despite the kick to
his head. He made a save on a play
that developed frotn a direct free
kick and another on a hcadcd bail.

So at the end of regulation tirrrc
the score was deadlocked at one all.
After two ten-minute overtime
pcriods of the same type of grueling
socccr' were played. the score still
remained unchanged and the game
ended in rr i-l tic.

Season Ends On Sour Note For Women Boaters

by Anne Cavanaglt

The Albany State Women's soccer
team ended their season at 6-8 with
a losing battle against Springfield

. this past Saturday. 3-0. Springfield

is ranked eighth in Now England.
and lircir final dominating lead was
not too surprising.

“We knew Springfield would be
strong. We just wanted to go out

Albany women‘s soccer coach Arny
Kidder.

The first and only goal scored in
the first half was by Springfield
striker Kim Miles at 37:i5.

That really ptrt us down." sttrtcd
Kidder. "We haven't won a gamc
unless we scorcd first." Evert so.
the first half was cvcrrly matched.
