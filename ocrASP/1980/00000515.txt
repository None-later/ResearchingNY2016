He could barely speak. Twelve

hours earlier_ Albany wrestling

- coach Joe DeMeo was busy prepar-
ing for one of the largest wrestling
tournaments on the East coast, the
Great Dane Eastern Classic, but
now his _voice was 'gone and he was
tired. But he was proud. The
Albany State wrestling team, a
relatively young and inexperienced
Division 111 team, had placed third

‘ among 28 teams in Divisions 1, ii,
and 111.

“They did fantastic," said
DeMeo. “1 never thought that we
could be third —— fifth would have
been a dream." I

The tournament was a marathon
event, beginning at about 11:30
Saturday morning and continuing
until about 11:00 that night in
University Gym. it was run on it
five had mark systerii with each
wrestler getting lit/ill least two inat—
ches, and nobody being eliminated
after a loss. The top three in each
weight class were given awards.

The overall team winner, to
nobody‘s surprise, was Division 1
powerhouse Syracuse University
with till points, for outdistancing
Boston University in second place
with 37 points and Albany with 19.
DeMco had earlier predicted that
Syracuse will be in the top three in
the nation by the year's end anti
they did nothing to make anybody

doubt it.

Syracuse wrestlers won eight of
the ten weight classes and two of
them were named Outstanding
Wrestlers of the tournament. Gene
Mills, a world champion in the 126
pbund class, won the award for
under 150 pounds. and Tim
Cataifo, a 158 pounder, notched it
for those over 150 pounds.

"As a team we have very good
balance and our kids are all going

for the ‘fall. They're very ag-
gressive," said Syracuse wrestling
coach Ed Carlin. c

Despite not winning any weight
classes, Albany turned in a tremen-
dous performance. “So many peo-
ple Won matches for us, that's what
made it so great. 13 out of 19 of our
guys won matches." said DeMeo.

Top performances were given by

1 Andy Seras and Vic Herman, who

placed second in their weight classes

as well as by Mark Goossens and

and fifth, respectively.

Herman was outstanding in the
190 pound class, but lost to John
Dougherty from Syracuse, the first
place winner. “Vic was'great — he
wrestled a real tough hombre this
John Dougherty. Vic gave "it
everything,“ DeMeo said.

“i think i wrestled as good as 1
could," said Herman. “l'm further

was last year. i'm pretty happy."
DeMeo noted that Herman lost a
lot of preparation time this summer
while he was recovering from an il-

lness and that he's not at peak per-

formance yet.

Seras, wrestling in the 142 pound
class, was Albany's other award
winner. This was Seras‘ first col-
legiate tournament after a very suc-
cessful high school career and he
appears to have made the transition
well. He won six matches and his
only loss of the day came in the se-
cond round til the ltatitls of the
eventual winner, Gary Sicgal of
Syracuse, 8-6.

Seras said that he thought he
should havc won the weight class,
bill be made some crucial mistakes
irt his rntttch against Sicgtil.

“1 controlled the mritch for 5:30
(he was tip 5~2) and then l blew it. l
mentally blew the march," Seras
admitted.

There was a little controversy in
the heavyweight division where
Mark (J‘oossens finished fourth for
Albany. He was originally slated for
the top three. which would have in»

the top honors, btit he was inform-

Alfred Passes By Slumping Great Danes, 24-6

 

Saxon Air Attack Picks Defense
Apart; Albany Drops To Even 4-4

by Bob Bellufiore

ALFRED JUNCTION — The
respective situations of the teams
playing were radically different.
The Danes were playing for pride.
Having lost to Norwich a week

earlier. any chances of playoffs
under the new NCAA format were
dashed. Albany was just iii another
game. i '
Alfred, on the other hand. had
thoughts of'an extended season.

earlier game this season. (Photo: Mark Nudler)

Now, two learns from each
geographic region will be chosen for
the playoffs, and the Saxons were
ranked seventh in the cast. lint
more importantly, they were
number two in the Lambert llowl ~
the poll that decides who goes to the
national playoffs. if they could
defeat a respected team such its
Albany, they could keep that se-
cond spot (behind lthaca), and stay
(I contender in the eyes of the
NCAA selection cotnrnittee.

As it titrticd out, that rriotivation,
a red hot Bob Schuster at quarter—
back, and the ability to capitalize
on Albany miscucs led Alfred to a
convincing 24-6 victory over the
Danes here Saturday afternoon.

“We needed that one," said
Alfred head football coach Sam
Sanders. “We felt that this was the
next to the most important game to
date," he continued, calling the
Saxons earlier contest with lthacu
as being more important.

The main reason for Alfred's stic-
ccss Saturday, as it has been all
season, wastltc All-American ctiri<
didatc Scliustcr. The 6-2, 210 pound
signaLcallcr'was good on 26 of 38
passes (12 of 18 in the first half) for
a 68.4 percent efficiency, and an
impressive 269 yards. But most of
these completions were short drtrnp
passes to backs ottt of the backfield
who would either slide through the
line of scrimmage or llood one of
the butside short zones. Witlt sub

.loc Martin, Alfred was 28 of 42 in
th‘ air, for 281 yards.

“11c riickied and dimcd us‘ to
d‘tith," said Albany defensive
coordinator Mike Mottn. “He
always had five reccivcrs ottt, and

-l1‘ always had safety valves." “it

seemed as if many times he was just
picking us apart," added Albatty
head football coach Bob Ford. in-
deed, 21 of Schnster's 26 comple-
tions were for 15 yards or less.

The Sttxon strategy was to send
tw'o receivers into a particular area,
forcing tire defender to milk ' a deci-
sion on whom to cover. Schuster
would just hit the open man. “They
were ruruiiug it hit of pick pat-
terns." Mottti stiitl. “They would
send one giiy into the flat (short
outside zone), and one guy into the
cttrl in the seam (between two
defenders iii the rouecoverage). A
lot of times, i couldn't see the gtty
in the curl behind me," sttitl Albany
cornerback Jerry Wicrrhieki.
“There were two people over there
(in .the tint) all day."

Schuster threw most of his passes
to his backs, biit the big irittti for
Alfred was split critl Matt Sullivan,
who had eight catches for 115 yards
and a 14.4 yard pcr catch average
despite the double—coverage that he
drew for a good deal of the day.

“God knows. we irrixeti up the
coverages," l’ord 's'uid about
Albany‘s defensive garlic plan. “We
did just about everytlting i could
tlrirtk of."

if Alfred's ball-control wing-'1‘
attack wasn't doing enough
damage, the Dtlllcti certainly helped
tlicrir with some costly penalties attti
mistakes on offense. infractions
marked off 7‘) yards against Albany

~ not an incredible amount — but
they seemed to corirc at the worst
times for them.

Bill the real thorns in Albany’s
side were turnovers, The Dunes lost
two fumbles and threw three irr-
tcrceptions. The Saxons wasted no
lirirc iii capitalizing.

Ahead 3—1) on it 30-yard first

Never Received Absentee Ballots

A number of SUNY students
were unable to vote in Tuesday's

him had registered late.

Lester said SA is considering

said llttll thc absentee ballots would
be used as evidence tltttt college

Snook said that on the day alter

In addition, two police officers
now replace the night watchman in-
side the Draper complex. They are
also available to escort the stream
of students leaving the building
after the last 10:15 night class.
Williams said these police (“life-TS;

out of the university budget.

The student response to the addi-
tional safety patrol has been highly
favorable. Williams said, “l‘vc
talked to people in the area and they

Additional safety features are be-
ing installed by the plant depart~

vastly increasing the amount of
lighting in the Draper area. Within
two weeks the amount of light will
be doubled,"

Emergency crimpus phones are
also being installed in the Draper

them on order now arid will install
them its they come in," Williams
confirmed. “The phones will allow
students to reach the safety patrol if
they are in need of it."
