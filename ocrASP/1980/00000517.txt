V'Holtzman- Won’t Concede‘Race ‘

New York. N.Y. (Ai’) Rep.
Elizabeth Holtzman said today that
although all ballots were not yet
counted. it was clear that she had
lost her campaign for the US.
Senate from New York. _
She declined to say she was con~
ceding to the election to Republican
winner Alfonse D'Amato. There—
are an estimated 100,000 outstan-'
ding paper ballots which she had
impounded throughout the state
and an aide, Carter Eskcw, said
that if they were tallied and showed
she won. site would claim victory.
However, Ms. Holtzman told a
news conference today that “while
all the ballots are not counted; the
outcome is clear. While the cam-
paign is lost. the principles on
which we ran . . . are undefeated."
The Democratic candidate at-
tributed hcr.loss to “the Reagan

landslide. the distraction of a third-

candidate, and Mr. D’Amato had
an immense amount of money. He
spent more than $1 million more
than I did." '

But, she said, the loss did not
.mean theend of her political career.

“1 don't intend to vanish from
public life," she said. She said she
would continue to fight for issues
such as social justice. and equal
employment.

“New York will have to wait a lit-
tle longer for its first woman
senator .
said.

Ms. Hoitzman’s voice cracked
while she was thanking various sup-
porters who wcrc present at the
news conference in her Manhattan
headquarters, including city Comp-
troller Harrison J. Goldin and City
Council President Carol Bellamy.

rBerkeley Anti-Drafters
Protest Against Reagan

Berkeley (AP) A protest against Ronald Reagan's election as presi-
dcnt grew into an anti-draft demonstration Wednesday, with more
that 150 protesters marching into the main administration building at
the University of California at Berkeley.

The apparently spontaneous entrance into California Hall took
place after several hundred pcoplc marched from Sproul Hall - site of
many anti—draft rallies in the late [9605 —— to Peoples Park and on to
the campus ROTC building and to the administration building.

They chanted “Hey, hey, ho ho. ROTC has to got to go."

No offices were believed to be occupied. Thc chancellor's office is in
the building. and some administrators left when the marchers walked

Two dozen campus police were on the scene, officials said. but there
were no immediate rcports of rrrrcsts.

The rnrrrclrcrs continued their chanting inside the building.

it was the second demonstration in less than 24 hours.

detail, there will be Reagan. a chair-
man of the board delegating
authority and lcrrtring heavily on
those around for help in making
decisions.

Thus, on Jan. 20. President
Ronald Wilson Reagan. rancher
and former actor, will bring both a
new atmosphere and attitude to thc
Wiritc Housc its he tries to imple—
ment a blueprint for changing the
way the government has worked for
decades.

“More than anything else. l want
to get government off your backs.“
Reagan told audiences in what
amounted lo the theme song of his
campaign.

.'The 39-year-old congresswoman

jchoked up at another point as
about 60 campaign workers who
crowded the room applauded when
she ﬁnished her statement.

“The election does not mean that
.New Yorkers have abandoned this
state‘s tradition of humane and

compassionate politics,’-’ she said. '

“it only means that while 'yve could ,

have overcome the anti-Carter tide
that swept the nation or the distrac-
tion of a thirdcandidatc in the race.

.‘thc combination of these forces was

too great and allowed Mr.
D'Amato to slip through.”

She said she thought she would
have won if Republican Sen. Jacob
Javits, the third candidate who ran

. on the Liberal Party line, had drop-

ped out of the race.

She also noted that site “had no
control over the immense and in-
tense anti-Carter sentiment" that
put Ronald Reagan into the White
House and. presumably, helped sw-
ing some support to other
Republican candidates.

She also claimed a lot of special-
intercst money was donated to cum—
paigns in tire statc, something that
should be prevented by election
law.

Ms. Holtznran also acknowledg-
cd that her campaign manager, Litr-
da Davidofl‘. had called lavits on
Tuesday and urged him to drop out
of the race and appeal for his voters
to back the Democrat.

“i believe two hours before the
election was over, that call was
made," she said.

Javils did not meet the request.
He got it pcrcerrl of the vote, while

'Amato received 45 percent and
Ms. Holtzrnan received“ percent.

 

in accepting the

to the federal government the
capacity to do the people's work
without dominating their lives."

Tire centerpiece of Reagan's year-
long canrprrign was his economic
program, and in particular his
pledge to seek it 30 percent cut in in-
come tnx rutcs for individuals —— 10
percent at year for three years —-
along with accclcrnlcd depreciation
for business.

it remains uncertain whether [in
Republican president can deliver on
that promise. Congress must ap-
provc first.

Rcirgtrrr said that once toxcs had
been cut 30 percent, he would push
for income tax indexing to adjust
tax rules to the rate of inﬂation.

payers irrlo higher tax brackets. .
