OPEN LETTER To SA FUNDED GROUPS

As group leaders we have become concerned with the lack
of unity, the'duplication of programs and conflicting schedules
among all of us;

We do have the potential to share our resources, to increase
programming and to end the senseless waste of student money.

We cannot begin to cooperate until we start to communicate.

We ask, yes, challenge you, to join us in our efforts to form a
means for us to cooperate, by attending a meeting; for an hour

Novem r - m in ﬁneEEestLloungt-z for an hour

or so. This meeting is the beginning of a foundation to form a
University Programming Board. Such a Board has tremendous
potential on this campus, to pool our resources, end duplication,
and begin cooperative scheduling. l

It is crucial that each SA group send a member to this meeting.
Only by banding together can we protect our interests in SA and
on the campus. Our money and our future may be on the line,
if we do not join our efforts.

Please join us on November 12 at 6:30 pm. This beginning
can't succeed without you.

Selective Service May

by Mark Flschetll

There has been speculation that
in addition to trying to get Census
Board and Social Security lists. the
Selective Service plans to use college
registration lists as part of their data
base in tracking down draft
registration evaders, according to
an article published in SUC-
Brockport’s newspaper Sly/us and
reprinted in the ASP on October
14, l980.

“The University has not ltad any
requests for such information nor
do I know ofany other campus that
has been contacted." SUNYA
President Vincent O'Leary said
Monday.

Selective Service, according
to the Brockport article, is finaliz-
ing its data base of all young men
who were supposed to have
registered for the draft this past

summer. and will begin tracking
down evaders sometime this
November.

Selective Service has warned
that failure to register for the draft
is punishable by imprisonment,
ﬁnes up to $10,000. or both. .

“Our policy with respect to
lists.” O’Leary said, "“is that we
won’t release any list unless there is
a requirement by law..

“The real question is," he added,
“What if the Selective Service asks
for a general list?"

Were Selective Service to askI
the response would be based on the
Family Educational ‘ Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974. which states:

"An educational agency or in-
stitution shall obtain the written
consent . . .of a student . . .bcfore
disclosing personally identifiable in-

formation from the educational.

records of a student, other than

directory information . . ."
Hence. students must consent to

any disclosure of information made

by SUNYA to Selective Service,
unless it is directory information,
described in the Act as:

“ . . .the students name, ad-_

dress, telephone number. date and
place of birth, major field of
study. . .dates of attendance,
degrees and awards received. the
most recent educational agency or
institution attended by the stu-
dent . . ."

To stop the release of directory
information. students tnust request
in writing that all information in-

, cluded in his records be withheld.

according to the Act.

. Neil Brown. Dean for Student
Affairs. who also said that no con-
tact has been made between
Selective Service and the University,
wrote in a response to questions.
“We need to keep in mind, of
course, that the University Dircc~
tory is rather widely
available . . .(and this) information
— unless specifically restricted by
the student — is, therefore.

each campus to approach tltc Presi-
dent and the legal counsel in order
to fully understand the University's
policy.

“Student groups." he added.
“should organize to oppose the
release of records and should advise
students to request such informa-
tion be withheld."

Jim Tierney. chairperson of
.‘s‘UNYA’s Student Union. said SU

‘ is not making much of an attempt
to advise students. since Selec-
tive Service has not contacted the
Univcrsity yet. but that they would
certainly act promptly if such con-
tact was made.

“Back in the sixties." Tierney
said. “almost every high school and
college turned over their registra-

' tion lists to the Selective Service,
and the lists were used successful-
ly...

Not much was done to oppose
this action, but. as Tierney pointed
out, “The majority of the people in
the sixties registered. Tltosc who
didn't were those who were not
aware of it. like tltc inner-city
blacks or those who wandered
across the country.

"The mood of the country was
‘prosccute those ltippy-freaks who
don't rcgistcr’.“ Now, he con-
cluded. “the Federal government is
going to have to get a whole state to
jail (the registration evaders) in."
The Stylus article said Selective Ser-
vice had tried only six percent of the
l86,7ll men who evaded the draft
between July, l964 and June, 1973.
Five percent were convicted. it cott-
tinucs on to say, however, that
nearly 85 percent of the indictments
were dismissed before trial because
the accused had finally agreed to
obey the law. Students maynot have
that choice this titttc around. The
Stylus article quoted Selective Ser-
vice Director Bernard Rostkcr as
saying, “A person who fails to
register is a felon. Make no mistake
about it. The kid who throws down
tltc gutmtlct to the government will
be prosecuted."

According to chdttll Lorang of
the Office of Institutional
Rcscurch. 3.223 then attending
SUNYA last fall were of registra-
tion age. He doesn't suspect lltt'
number this year is tttttclt different.

it will be up to each of those in»
dividual students whether he
chooses to have his records
withheld forth the Selective Service.

University,‘ The only way a universi-
