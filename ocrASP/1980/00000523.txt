come up with some semblance of who the
lCB members are and what their songs are

' about.

The album's first' song throws everything
from flutes to synthesizers at us. it's called
"Sound H" and technically it is one of the
finest rock masterpieces ever composed. it
runs 5:54 and keeps us thinkan about it well
into the next song. “Stairs Without Barr-
nisters." an easy rocker just for the fun of it.
in those first two songs we are introduced to
the versatility of the hand. and in particular
the versatility of one of its members. S.G.
Bean. He seems to play lust about
everything.

Next carries the title track. "Urano." Here
we are introduced to the leads of guitarists
Mike Jay and Curtis Soole. Jay is very clear
and fast while Soole plays some of the best
slide guitar since Duane Allman. The first
side finishes up with “Kneel. Don't Duck"
which showcases the talents of bass guitarist
Salvatore Greek and lead vocalist Scott

Hurowitz' vocals are. well. "alright." This
song seems to be some type of rebellion for

Beat Crazy (credited to the Joe Jackson
Band) works in the same vein as the first two
albums. but avoids excessive repetition.
Jackson's music is based in the
“pub-rock" scene that first grew out of
England in the mid-70's (as is Costello and _
Parker's). but focuses less on the rhythm and
blues that marks that genre. and more on
mainstream "new wave"(lf that label still
means anything) rock 'n' roll with reggae'
overtones. The playing is kept simple and
direct. which is a plus. because the last thing
this music needs is pretension.

Jackson and his three piece band are tight
but never slick. Graham Maby. probably the
outflt's finest instrumentalist. sets up each
song with a firm. pulsating bass line. Guitarist
Gary Sanford slashes over the bass. restrains
extended leads and sticks mostly to riffs with
some use of distortion. Jackson himself dab-
bles with the keyboards, adding tastefully
spare licks that fill out the sound. and-Dave
Houghton rounds out the foursome on
drums.

Joe really is a fine tunesmilh: not as quirky
as Elvis: but melodic all the same. Bear
Crazy relies largely on mid-tempo songs
compared to the particularly kinetic Look
Sharp — but there are still plenty of lively.
upbeat rockers to be found. “Crime Don't
Pay" features a breezy. Ventures-type intro
that could be on the soundtrack album to "A
Hard Day's Night": “Someone Up
There"grooves with the satire intensity as I'm
the Man's l‘On the Radio" and sports an
equally dynamic chorus.

“in Every Dream Home (A Nightmare)"
— which has nothing to do with a similarly

for mummy fans.

Okay — it's silly,

But it is a lot of fun. The filrn is difficult as
hell to take seriously . . . it will undoubtedly
elicit a good deal of unintended laughter.
But that doesn't matter much with a film like
this. The audience doesn't want to take it
seriously. A few good screams. a few good
laughs. and they're happy. it's better than
TV, even if that isn't saying much.

'l‘echnically. the film holds up well largely
on the basis of Jack Cardiff's
cinematography Cardiff. who recently
photographed Death on the Nile. is probably
a little sick of Egyptian locales by now. which
doesn't alter the fact that he's one of the bet-
ter color cinematographers around. The
editing. while good within individuer se-
quences. doesn't hold up well during transi»
tions. In other words. The Awakening is
choppy. There is frequent evidence that the
producers decided the film was too long and
cut it down. Which brings us to The
Arunkcning's other problem: they didn't

always estimate correctly. Tire pacing slows
down too much in the middle.

tively stark atmosphere. reminiscent of the
Police's “Walking on the Moon"; and. the
popish “Pretty Boys” showcases the pulsing
reggae rhythms that the other songs flirt
with. and stands as the beat-craziest song on
the album. .

As for “That Girl." well. Joe is still going
through the motions. On the ballad "One to
One" (this year's "it's Different for Girls and
a strong candidate for hit single) he's tender
and caring. but still can't help getting Just a
little peeved: “ You're beautiful when you get

When Joe carries on like a domineering.
egocentric male. for instance. he might be
more cutting with a sharper punchline than
“l'm mad at you"(EIvis had the idea with
“l'm Not Angry") And. regardless of love.
Jackson seems determined to prove that he’s
the sanest man alive. It‘s always someone
else with the dark secret: “the guy who lives
upstairs"(does he beat up his girl?): or "the
girl who lives next door"(is she a whore?)
The craziest thing Joe admits about himself is
that he listens to the group The Cramps.

Joe Jackson does not have the vision of a
Costello or a Parker. but he‘s far mort

Charlton l‘leslorr. who could use a real
script. does the best he can with less than
magnificent material. Still. this is the best
thing he's had in years. Unfortunately. this
also doesn't say much. ironically. Heston
was offered 'I'Irr- Omen before Gregory
Peck, and turned it down.

The Awakening is based on the novel Th
Jun/cl of Sutton Stars. by Bram Stoker. best-
krrown as the author of Dracula. A5 are most
of Stoker's novels. this one is obscure and it
isn't readily possible to tell how closely the
updated script follows the book. it was filmed
once before. with Peter Cushing and
Christopher Lee in the fifties. under the title
Blood From the Murnmy's Tomb. when
Hammer Films was trying to remake every
thirties and forties monster in sight. That ver-
siou was said to he a "loose adaptation."

Producer Robert Solo. who produced the
remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers
seems to be trying to make another Omen
here. He certainly hasn't made a movie as
good. though if the crowds find The
Awakening ~ as i did — to be a cinematic
Big Mac. made to enjoy and feel guilty about
later. he might make as much money. 0
