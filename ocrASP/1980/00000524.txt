admirable job. given the situation; he had
to run all over the ﬁeld for every play.

The situation can be even more pro-
nounced in hockey. football, and basket-
ball where running to follow plays is even
more of a requirement. Let's face it, ump-
ing is hard work (mentally as well as
physically) and it is an insult to pay these
valuable people what SA currently does.

Hopefully a bill scheduled to be voted on
last Wednesday to increase the wages of the
ofﬁcials has passed easily. Regardless,
though. a great deal of good officials have
already been alienaféd by the treatment that
they have received up until now. Good of-
ficials are an important part of our in-
tramural program and proper funding
should always be provided to keep it that
way. Lack of money for officiating means
an overall lower quality in our intramural
program as a whole.

As usual, the student is the one to lose
out in the long run. An extra fifty cents per
game for each ofﬁcial will help everyone in~
volvcd. I think.that this is a small price to
pay to'maintain the quality intramural pro-
gram which Albany has been proud of in
tire past, and I trust can continue to be pro-
ud of in the future. if you how a gripe, or
maybe are just concerned, as i am, about
intramurals then tell somebody about it.
Call Denny Elkin, or go right to SA and let
them know what’s up. ifyou don't, nobody
will. They want and need our input.

— Bob Colvin

The ASP recognizes the problem of ﬁnding
competent ofﬁcials and sympathize: Willi
all three SUN YA intramural organizations.
A MIA ofﬁcials received good new Wednes-
day, however, as SA Central Council voted
to increase the game fee to $3.00 per game.
A pparenlly. Central Council recognizes the
need as the vote on the increase was passed
by a 26-2 margin, with two clutch/ions.

 

Pre-Law Pride

To the Editor: ‘

On behalf of the Pro-Law Association 1
would like to apologize to all those students
who braved the rainstorms Saturday, Oc-
lobcr 25, to attend the Law School Fair on-
ly to find the representatives t'ornt
Georgetown, American, Catholic, and
George Washington Schools of Law not
present. 1 was both angcrcd and embarrass-
ed to sec their absence, and the lack of rt
telephone call, or other form of
acknowledgement to explain that absence.
is rather disturbing.

On a positive note, i would likc to thank
lltc 400 plus students who attended the Fair,
dcspitc tltc ttdvcrsc weather. This lili‘gt‘ lur-
nout helped to demonstrate to the Universi—
ty that there is a very large prc-low com-
ttntttity on this campus; whosc needs and in—
lcrcsts must bc addressed in thc l'ttturc.

To the Editor:

We decided to Icot'gnni/c my lll'c.
(it-Itct'olly, l'm not .t pttrttttoid pctstttt, but i
fuel than our changing titttcs lutvc crcutcd
lllt' ttccd for u corresponding chztttgc itt my
lli‘cstylc.

The first step is. to begin schedulind m)
titty according to thc hours of sunrise tilltl
sunscl. i must Icrttcuthcr to avoid running
errands iii the (.‘ztpttol (IlL‘tl ui‘tct' 3:.lt) or
4:00 p.m., or else i might find myself
wuiling ttlonc ui‘lcr dot k (and it gt'ls dark so
“my now) at the notorious SUNYA bus
stop on the corttct‘ ot' Stttlc and i’ttplc
Slrccts. I could wait inside of a building it
there was one open after 5:00 p.1n., but it“ I
tried to wall inside of the Wellington 'Hotcl.
lllc hus wouldbc gone before l'd gotten to
the stop.

The ncxt rulc i must make for myself is
"Wu!" E0 to tltc downtown library by
mYSclf. The Hawlcy Library is considerably
ems" (and quieter) than the uptown

library, ,but it’s not worth walking the two
blocks alone. i hope my friends and i can
synchronize our schedules accordingly.

Of course, l'd always avoided walking by
myselfaftcr dark, but now i realize that 1'”
also have to stop going to the niorkct to
pick up an after library snack, or milk for
my morning's breakfast.

1 hope the situation here improves — l‘d
hate to have to start staying indoors during
the daylight hours, too.

Students Unite

To the Editor:

The students at SUNYA have won many
important battles in the struggle against
bureaucracy, but the most important battle
has yet to begin. Nearly every student who
passes through the Concrete Jungle can rat-
tle off the names of at least five or six total-
ly incompetent "professors" they have had
the misfortune to encounter. Getting a poor
grade due to the difficulty of a course is
quite understandable. However, when the
poor grade occurs chieﬂy due to the in-
competence of the teacher, it is time for
serious action to be taken both by students‘
and admiltlstration.

Tcachcrs should be accountable to the
same criteria that their counterparts in
private industry arc subject to. Most of the
teachers 11ch at Albany are fine, gifted in-
dividuals and should be rewarded for their
excellence, just as the inadequate ones
should be let go, or at least required to com-
plete a few teaching courses. All of the
teachers possess the knowledge of. the
course material. Some of them can't relate
that knowledge to the students.

Every student should realize that this is
perhaps the only issue that affects cvcry stu-
dent, rich or poor, black or white. Grades
rcccivcd hcrc will be extremely important in
getting a good job itt the years to come. No
unqualified teacher should be given the
chance to play such an important part in so
many lives.

When it is obvious to tltc vast majority it]
a class that tltc lcocltcr of the course can't
teach, petitions should bt: signed, and the
department [but tltc tcacltcr belongs to
should be notified of this dcficicncy. Work-
ing togctltcr. we can improve the qualify of
education at SUNYA!

Darts land Crafts-1'11 O1

 

 

   

'It has recently been brought to our attention that many'
students are misinterpreting the value and purpose of the ASP.
Quite frankly, we are shocked and appalled from learning that
numerous residents of the five quads and apartment dwellers
have draped the recent election issue up on the walls of their
rooms and are proceeding to toss darts at them.

While the 'ASP certainly
understands the frustra-
tions of this segment of the
student body, this defiant
practice must come to an

- . immediate halt. We work
pretty darn hard many
nights a week in order to
serve you, and a little
respect and kindness is all
we ask in return.

Like it or not, these two
pictured gentlemen are our
newly-elected leaders and
are therefore deserving of

Phnlutﬁtclnhmp/Kulnkulf better treatmentthan the
piercings from cheap plastic darts. By god, if you’re going to en—
joy yourself , at least have the decency to use higher quality darts.

(Whoops! Excuse us.)

In conclusion, if you happen to know of anyone engaging in
this peculiar activity, kindly bring it to the attention of the ASP
and we will begin charging these boobs for future issues.

However, if you know of no such practices, but would like to
take part in them, please feel free to use the dartboard presently
hanging in the ASP newsroom.

Of course, we do not condone it.
