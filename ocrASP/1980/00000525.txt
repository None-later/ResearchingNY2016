Horowitz thinks that Reagan's
proposed tax refunds will last for a
year. “They are too inﬂationary.
and won‘t be able to be used more
than once,"
“Reagan stated everything in broad
gcncraiitics. He never specified

' where tax cuts and cuts in govern-

ment spending would come’from,"
she added. As for stating her choice
for president. Horowitz answered.
“I believe in the secret ballot."

History Department Chairman
Dr. Robcrt F. Wesser'lsays he
thought Reagan would win‘ the elec-
tion. but was surprised with the
resulting landslide. “I’ve long since
given up on campaigns. They have
little to do with offices." said
Wcsscr.

Reagan‘s priorities during the
next four years will not be that
conservative, Wcsscr said. Hc
thinks tax cuts to curve inflation
willJac difficult since military cx-
[)CIILllllII'Ch will incrcttsc. Wesscr
{1180 projects u out ill social pro-
grams.

“I voted for John Anderson."
Dr. Wcsscr said. “i lilltl little hope
that Anderson would win. but his
ilttcliigcncc was a cut abtlvc the
other two.“ '

Wcsscr said that protest votes
similar to tilt oltc Itc cast for Ander-
son are important, "cspcciully
when the two major candidates are
inferior.”

History professor Graham J.
Burker-Bcnficld said that his int-
lncdiutc attitude was appallmcnt.
“lit the next four ycars there will be
rising inflation. high unemploy-
ment and increasing nuclear
power,” Ilarkcr-Bcnficid said. He

 

      
 

believes that lit the end, the Reagan

administration will be reactionary.
“It will be a replay of the Nixon
years, but the war won't be going
on yet." he said. Due to his status
as a foreign citizen, Barker-Benficld
said that he was unable to vote.

Diva Daims of the English
Department said she .was
“completely depressed" when she
learned of the Reagan victory. “I
never expected so much support for
Reagan," Daims said.

But site does expect cuts in social
programs and an increase in the
manufacture of arms. Shc forcsccs
problems for the poor,-biacks, and
the unemployed.

“I voted for Commoner on the
Citizens ticket," said Daims. “I am
tired of juggling my vote between

‘ the person i don't want and the per-
son I want less." Daims'concludcd.

in her reaction to the election of
Reagan. English professor Judy
Barlow said site was disappointed.
angry, and appalled. “I've got no
great love for Carter. but Reagan is
a dangerous mnn." Sltc called his
I'orcign pnlicics "sittiplistic." and
said tltc new prcsidcnt would not
help wottlcll. “Rcugun is opposed
to thc Equttl Rights Amendment
and tukcs an anti-abortion stand.
He wants to kccp wotncn in a
scctlttdvcluss city." shc commented.

Barlow feels that most people
voted against Curler. Regarding the
two main candidates, she said, "we
were told to choose bad or worse."
Iirtrlolv would not disclose her
choicc for president.
