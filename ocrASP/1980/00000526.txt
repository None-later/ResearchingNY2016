Philliesi Greene To Keep Post" '

Philadelphia, Penn. (AP) Dallas
Green, the gruff, get-the-job-d'one
skipper of the world champion
Philadelphia Phillies, said Thursday
he doesn'tenvision a major
sllakeup in 1981, but hinted that
none of'the starters‘ jobs is safe

r either.

Green, appearing at a news con-
ference to confirm reports that he
had signed a one—year contract to
manage the National Hague club
next season, said one thing was cer-
tain: "My personality is not going
to change. 1'” still be the same pain
in tlte rear end tllat 1 am now."

The 46-year-old Green was nam-
ed manager of the Phillies in
August 1979. replacing Danny
Ozark. a mild-lltnnncred man who

led the club to three division charrr- '

pionships, btlt never could capture
a pennant.

Green's no—rronsclrsc approach to
.the game — his tlse ol‘ ambitious
youngsters irt place ul~ pouting
veterans, ltis refusal to pamper solid

gold egos — irked some of the
club‘s superstars. But it get results,
with some of the Phillies bickering
all the way to the World Series.

“We've got a good blend of
veterans and kids and we‘re going
to continue that blend and we're
going to continue with the 25-man
theory." Green said Thursday. “1
think we have a chance to repeat it.
It’s that simple.

"We don't need to make a lot of
changes. But we have to make some
changes because I think any team
can stay stagnant and continue in a
winning situation. And I think Pitt-
sburgh proved tllat to some degree
this season.

"If we cart make a deal, a trade
that will improve us. we'll do that.
And we'll also look long and hard
at sortie of the kids that 'mighr be
ready to continue that pushing of
veterans and continue that
l‘rcshllcss that we need. l’m not go-
ing to let us sink back into the
ltlisscL-fltirc. thc believing that

Albany student Press

we're the world champs and the 25
guys 1 went with are safe.”

Green has made it clear that he
would prefer a job in"the front of-
fice. where he worked until,replac~
ing Ozark. But he said that club
owner Ruly Carpenter had made
him “very happy" with the new
contract.

“Naturally winning the World
Series put me in a situation where I
could certainly hit Ruly for a few
extra bucks," Green said. "But 1
would prefer again not to get itlto a
career managing situation."

As for restoring some harmony
to the club, the 6-foot-4 Green said
he plans to reﬂect on the past
season over the winter. adding that
time will help him to bcttcr unders-
tand his players‘ personalities.

“And 1 think in tllrn they too will
understand rrty personality :1 little
bit better. So I don't think we'll
ltave tllc continual friction that we
had ill 1980. 1 will try'to irllprove. I
hope some players will, too."

Browns Seeking “Holy Grail”

(Al’) You can almost cnvisiolt some
of the younger players curling up at
the knees of tllc masters, the guys
who havc bccrr THERIZ! "Tell us,"
they implore, “tell us what it's like
to be ill a Super Bowl."

And Lyle Alzttdo and Calvin Hill
lean back, a wistful look clouding
their eyes. and tell the rest of the
Cleveland Browns of those oncc-
rlporr-rl-tinrc days. They‘re among
the few links the Browns have with '
days which haven’t been tilled with
"lforllys. . ."

“It only we played it] another
division , . . ll' only Pittsburgh did

. . or l-lotlston did."

"if only we could
strongly as we start."

“ll‘ottly. .

The Special Trip

by Bob Bellallore

The last time theAlbany State football team took a road trip like the
one they'll-embark on tonight was in 1977, when they went to play
Widener in the NCAA playoffs. Now. the stakes aren't nearly as high,
» but a big road trip is a big road trip. and, regardless ofrccord, this is a

If nothing else. this weekend's activities (which include a day at
Disneyworld) might provide a different type of experience that other-

"lt's definitely something special," said Albany offensive linemen
George Broduer. "I think the surroundings, just the idea of being in
Florida, will make it that ntucll more — add extra incentive, maybe."

"The point we've tried to make is ‘don't forget, we‘re going down
to play a ballgamc Saturday'," Albany head football coach Bob Ford

"It'll be a good experience," said Dane fullback Chuck Priorc. "1
think it'll make us rise to the occasion, ltopefrrlly."

“Being the last away game for the seniors. it'll be a lot to

way to go out," said Don Bowen, a senior. "But just playing

"I'm excited about going." said 1th Ragulc, Albany's leading
Irtcklcr'. "But it's not it vacation. We‘re going down there to win."

So, at least rrraybc tllc Danes can find solrtc l'lln ill what's been all
otherwise frustrating .scasoll. Ford ltotcd what he called “Super Bowl
Syndrome," where. it‘ tl‘lCtlm didn't make it to tile championship
garlic. it felt as it' its efforts were wasted. and he didn't want that to
happen to his squad. "l think tltc thrill of competition lras‘to be the
thing that drives yoll." he said. "That‘s what's at stake — to see who

or plttyctl ll night garlic in tr 48.000 scat stadium. or cvcrl traveled that
