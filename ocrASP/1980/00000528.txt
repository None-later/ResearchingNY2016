Enthusiastic Women Swimmers. Working

by Marc Haspel

Enthusiasm is a necessary ele-
ment towards success in swimming.
it can drive those with potential to
do well and those who do well to do
even better; Enthusiasm also hap-
pens to be a characteristic of the
1980-81 women's swim team, accor-
ding to Albany women’s swimming
coach Sarah Bingham. This spirited
team has been working very hard at
University Pool during the last
month and, while it is not blessed
with many top rated swimmers,
Bingham expects her squad to be
competitive in the season ahead.

“l'd describe this team as cn-
joyablc. They're willing to work
hard and have so far this year,"
said Bingham.

This year's squad is larger than
last year’s and is very well rounded.
Good depth lies in many areas in-
cluding the middle distance free
style. a softer spot of last season's
4-9 team.

The strongest area in the Dane
lineup will be thé sprint events (50
and 100 yards) of the free style and
butterfly strokes. Albany's top
swimmer, Donna Staracc, will be
competing in those events. Staracc,
a returning sophomore, may very
well be the best swimmer that the
Danes have to offer this season.

“Donna is my strongest sprinter
on the team. She ltas a way to go,
but she is at the top,” Bingltam
commcntcd.

Along with Starace in the butterf-
of sprinter range,
Bingham is looking at new-comer
sophomore Barb Witt, who is very
strong, according to the coach.

Aside from. Staracc and Will,

 

Bingham has two other sprinters in
co-captain senior Lisa Sotnek and
Judy Coltai. The latter pair will be
able to give the Danes added punch
in this area.

The Danes also have a solid
backstroking crew. Robin Brown, a
transfer from the University of ii-
linois, co-captain Beth Larson and

‘Annc Wilson (who missed last

season because of mononucleosis)
are all within seconds of each other.
They all are solid middle range
swimmers who can put points on
tltc Albany scoreboard.

“My backstrokch are not top
caliber, but tltcy can almost always
pull offa second or third if they're
racing a ringer in that event." said

. l. v
Albany Student Press I

Bingham. ‘

Brown will also team up with
Lauri Ann ngncs to provide
Albany with two ﬁne swimmers in
the breaststroke. Here as in the
backstroke, Bingham ﬁgures that
both Brown and Baincs are good
enought to score seconds and
thirds, if not firsts, for the Danes.

in the distance freestyle events of
500, l000. and 1650 yards, the
Danes have two decent top-middle
range swimmers, sophomore Joan
Nugcnt and freshman Sheila Fitz-
patrick. Also in the freestyle events,
Bingham is high on Jean Lardner
and Betty Kwasman who can be
“good frecslylcrs. They can break
in and help," said Bingham.

 

  

\ Blngham feels that the talent of
this season's squad is very well
distributed. There are‘no real stan-
douts in this group of 18 women.
This, however, may become an im-
:pllcit strength in that the team .will
not rely on one member to be the
only point scorer.

“l have a lot of top middle peo-
ple but really no top top swimmers.
The closest is Staracc," said
Bingham.

Albany's first meet of the year is
on the ﬁfteenth of November
against Skidmore. Not until then
will Bingham really be able to tell
just how good her team is. She will
get a good indication, though, on

   

Saturday when Albany hosts the an-

Hard

'nual‘Grcat Dane Relay Meet.

Twelve teams will be competing
'ln this event, which will run all
afternoon on Saturday. Schools
that will be represented include
,Albany. Eisenhower College,
ithaca quiegé, McGill University,
Morrisviile, Plattsburgh, RPl,
Russell Sage, St. Lawrence, Saint
Rose, Skidmorc, and Vassar.

The relay meet provides the
swimmers with an excellent oppor-
tunity to adjust to real meet condi-
tions without'lndividual pressure.‘
Besides. according to Bingham. it
gives the coaches a chance "to
check out the competition."

“Overall, it's a very encouraging
type of thing," explained Bingham.

She feels that the Danes have tit;
ability to ﬁnish in the upper half t ‘
the pack. The teams that Albany
will almost have to beat to finish
highly are Russell Sage, Skidmore,
and RPl. if the Danes fare well

I. against these schools, they may be
 ablc to place as high as i'tfth.

“i would like to see us place
ﬁfth, sixth, or seventh, depending
on wltcthcr we can beat Sage. Skid-
morc, and RPl. We have the team

, to do it and that's a realistic goal,"

said Bingham.

But the coach has higher goals
than that — the New York State
Championships. Last season cight

advanced to the
competition, and this

every member thcrc. Realistically,
though, that would take a lot of
discipline and hard work this
season.

But, as Starace commented, “i
think that cvcryonc on this team is
working a little harder this year."

° Spikers Fight Overconfidence As Wins Mount
Beat Skidmore To Extend Streak

by Larry Kuhn

The New York State volleyball
championships begin one week
from today at Stony Brook and
Albany State is one school sure to
be represented. The Danes spikch
are riding a 14 game winning streak
including their latest victory, one
over Skidmorc on Tuesday night.
Their 22-5 record is one of the best
in the state. ‘

One of the problems associated
With a very successful team is over-
conﬁdence. Albany has been no cx-

 

ccption and they havc had to fight
back against wcakcr tcams with
some regularity. Such was the case
on Tuesday night.

“Overall “'1: played well, but it
wasn't our host match of the year. I
think we \vcrc u lilllc too ovcrconfi-
dent." said Albany volleyball coach
Pal DWyL-r, “it was the kind of
game that if we wcrcn‘t playing well
we wouldn‘t have won."

Albany blasted their way to a
l5-3 triumph in the first game, but
Skidmorc bolted to a quick lead in

the second contest with l2
unanswered points. Albany got
tough, but it wasn't enough and
they lost, 9-15.

"Skidmort' was playing very well
they were very emotional,"
noted Dwycr.

Thc Dancs looked like tltcy were
back on top of things in the tltird
bout when they jumped out to an
8-] advantage. But they suffered a
major sctbuck when the referee
tictcclcd an error on the Albany
scotcsltcct, which they should have
picked up earlier, and look away all
cigltt points. The mistake proved to
he inconsequential, though, as
Albany churng hack to win, 15-l3.

“It was kind of depressing. it's u
very frustrating situation to he in.”
hﬂltl Dwyct, ‘

In the final game Albany put it all
together and routed Skidnmrc,
[5-2. “We plztycd rcttlly well and
just annihilated them," said Dwycr.

One good thing that came out of
this match is that the Albany
players rcalizc that they can't just
sit back and watch the wins roll up,
they httvc to concentrate and play
their best at all times. They may
have bccn able to get away witlta
little overconfidcncc against some
of the weaker teams‘but they will
have problems in post-season play

were ovcrconfidcnt. They have to

realize that anybody can beat

anybody in this game — hopefully

they have learned something."
The selections for the State cham-

pionships will bc made this weekend
and Albany should he onc of them.

winner of that tournament will go
to Nationals.

“We have a chance. We have a
good enough record, but i don’t
know if we have a good enough
scltcdulc. They like a lot out of state
play," Dwycr notcd.

Albany’s final match of the

regular season is against RPI on
Wednesday in University Gym at
7:00

than last year. it should be an in-
