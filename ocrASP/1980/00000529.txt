The Danes, as most people know,
are mainly a running team. The

is the vehicle that gets them where
they want to go. Well, for Albany
to get where it wants to be minor-

Bob Ford ﬁrst got the idea at ar
NCAA meeting in New Orleans last
January. “i heard that there were
some Florida teams interested in
having northern teams come down
to play them,” Ford recalled. After
checking in an NCAA guide, Ford
sent letters to St. Leos and Central
Florida — the only two schools
listed as playing Division lll foot-
ball in Florida.

Don Jonas was not aware of
Ford's thoughts or actions. As head
coach of the University of Central
Florida Knights, Jonas was trying
to build a program which had begun
intercollegiate play in 197‘). He was
an unpaid part-timer, so he left
scheduling to the Atllletic Director.
Back in Albany, Ford received
two offers. St. Leo's would give the
Danes a $2,000 guarantee for travel-
ing to Florida for a ballgame. Ceri-
tral Florida guaranteed $5.000.
Central Florida also played their
home games iii the 48,000 seat
Tangerine Bowl iri Orlando, home
of Disneyworld. it was an enticing
package. and after ironing out a
few details, a contract was signed,

The Knights, 3-3-l, are only in
their second year of varsity play
(they were 6-2 last year), but are still
a formidable opponent for the 4-4
Danes. “l’m impressed as hell with
them on film," said Albany tread
football coach Bob Ford, “30 I
don't know what we're getting in
to."

Albany usually has several op‘

portcrlts, but geography has made

State football history-For Central
Florida, tomorrow night‘s game
will be their lirst corttcst with a nor-
theastern opponent. For Albany, it
will be a weekend of fun, sun, and
football . . .all Florida style.

“There are multiple beneﬁts,"
said Ford. “It will be an experience
for the kids on the team. When we
went“to the playoffs in 1977, about
sixty percent of our kids had never
flown before, and i would be
shocked if it's arty different this
year, Plus, we have a chance to play
in one of the largest stadiums iii the
nation, and the trip has got to help
us itl recruiting, We also have over
six hundred alumni in the Florida
area, so it will give them a chance to
keep iti contact with us."

The trip comes at art intriguing
time for the Danes. They have lost
two straight games, post a 4'4
record, and will close out their
season ill Albany next week against
a powerful Springfield team. A
loss in Florida could snowball into
an unsettling four game losing
streak, a dip under .500, and the
most losses iii a season in Albany’s
ll-year history.

plan. The satire holds true for UCF.
and the two teams have exchanged
Films in order to alleviate the prov.
blem. "They probably know as lit-
tle about us as we do about thénl,"
Ford said.

But what the Danes do know is
that UCF is a squad ‘stacked with
talent. size. and potential. “Their

The biggest itsset tlittt UCF owns
tllrit would allow for such a move is
their size — especially oil the offen-
sivc litre. The front five on the
Knights pro-style nttuck average 235
pounds per‘nliui, and there is only
one player out of that group that
weighs less than 2l5 pounds (guard
Dori Ellison, at l80). UCF has a
pair of bookcnd tackles in Randy
High (6-5, 240) and Neal Ginley
(6-8.265). The latter began his col-
Icge career at the University of
Michigan, where he traveled to the

Consider:

None of this is lost on Jonas.
“lt‘s ii gold mine for recruiting,"
he said. “We're iii a situation where
a lot of schools tire calling us and
asking if they can play us." Arid the
interest is not isolated lo_ the
hopeful opponents. Last year, the
Knights set tin NCAA Division lll
record for a first—year program.

Surprisingly enough, tliuugll,
with that kind of personnel on the
offensive line, the Knights are a
passing team, throwing the ball ap-
proximately 75 percent of the tirrlc.
“We depend on the pass," said
Knight’s head football coach Don
.lonas. The main reason for that is
senior quarterback Mike Cullison.
“Hc's got a real strong arm." said
Albany defensive coordinator Mike
Motta. “He can throw the ball."
On the season, Cullisori hits becir

to collie and play us,’ said Jonas,
who is no stranger to big-time foot-
ball, having played iii the 1961
Gator llowl as a rutirlingback for
Penn State. “it's quite a thrill to
play iii the Tangerine Bowl. And I
don’t know what Albany’s doing,
but the other schools that collie to
play us frortt otlt of state stay over
on Sunday and go the
Disneyworld."

So are the Danes. After raflliitg
off it car and sponsoring a cortic—
ditin on campus to raise most of the
additional $7,000 nccded for the
trip, the Albany players and
coaching staff are eagerly awaiting
this as a getaway front what has
essentially been a frustrating
season. The l'tllttl‘fitlsltlg, cottplcd
witlt it difficult schedule, has left
the Danes somewhat spent, and
Ford attempted to wade through
the extra activities and focus on the
essentials:

“We’re going tiowti to Florida,
first__und foremost, to Will the
garlic," said I-‘ord, tryitrg to sound
persuasive. “We can't lose sight of
the ballgame, and we've continued
to enipllnslrc that. Everything else

 

is just a sidelight. It's not a car-
nival.“
