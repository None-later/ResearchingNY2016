'HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) Steve McQueen, the rugg-
ed actor whose unorthodox battle against cancer
epitomized his character on the screen. died Friday at a
clinic in Juarez, Mexico, one day after surgeons remov-
ed a five-pound tumor from his abdomen. He was 50.
“He was in extreme pain." said Dr. Cesai' Santos, who
performed the surgery. “McQueen and his wife came
and asked for the operation because of the pain. He was
under constant sedation because of the pain. The
possibility of his surviving the operation was extremely
poor." said Santos. “He had cancer all the way to his
diaphragm and cancer from the right lung was pushing
into the left lung.” Santos said the operation had reduc-
ed but not eliminated the pain, and added that McQueen
might have lived two or three more months without the
operation. “But suddenly he had a heart attack and
died," about 2:00 a.m. EST on Friday, said Santos' wife
Rosa Maria, administrator of the one story, 20-bed
brick Clinica de Santa Rosa. At the time of his death,
two friends of the family were in the room. McQueen's
wife, Barbara, and two children by a previous marriage,
son Chad, 21, and daughter Terri,20, had just left the
room when he died. His death shocked the film industry
and his fans. it had appeared that McQueen, star of
such films as Hui/lit, The Great Escape, and The Sand
Pebbles, for which he received an Oscar nominatiort in
1966. ~ had been making a recovery of sorts from
mesothelioma —- a form of lung cancer that many doc-
tors regard as incurable.

 

US. Issues Reply to Iran

ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher handed to Algerian Foreign
Minister Mohamed Benyahia today the formal
American reply to lran's conditions for releasing the 52
hostages held there for more than a year. Details of the
American reply remained a closely guarded sccrct. A
U.S. Embassy spokesman said Christopher personally
delivered the American reply “to explain to the govt:th
ment of Algeria several complex legal and financial

 

‘ aspects" raised by the lraniart conditions. The Algerian

government, which has been acting as intcrmcdiary bet-
ween Washington and Tehran in the delicate negotia-
tions over the hostages, was expected to relay the
American reply to lran within hours. it was trot known
if any lranian officials were here. The cntbas‘sy
spokesman said it was not immediately clear when
Christopher would return to Washington. He arrived in
a special U.S. Air Force plane earlier in the day, accom-
panied by a group of high U.S. officials, including lltc
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South
Asian Affairs. Harold Saunders. Tbc official Algerian
news agency reported Christopher's arrival but made no
other comment. The U.S. group went directly to the
hilltop American Embassy for urgent consultations with
U.S. Ambassador Ulrich Haynes. lrt Washington. State
Department officials said it was highly unlikely that
Christopher would mcct with the lranian authorities.

Ten Workers Rehired

NEW YORK, N.Y. (AP) Ten blacks and Ptrcrto Ricans
fired as bus drivers from the Buffalo, N.Y., transit
system will be offered theiriobs back, the State Division
of Human Rights announced Monday. Tltcy had claim-
ed racial discrimination. The tcn complained that a rule
which makes probationary employees liable to dismissal
for two failures to report for work discriminated against
minorities because Caucasian employees were not tired
in .similar situations. The complaints were filed against
the Niagara Frontier Transit Authority, Niagara Fron-
tier Transit Metro Systern, lnc., which denied any racial
discrimination. However, Richard Cinrk, regional direc-
tor of the Division. found probable cause to believe the
transit system was engaged “in the unlawful
discriminatory practice complained of." According to
the DHR. the transit system agreed during conciliation
metings to offer rc-cmployrrtcnt to the complainants.

 Polish Students Strike .

WARSAW, Poland (AP) Some 1,000 medical students
in the Polish port of Gdansk went on strike to support
teachers and health care workers occupying a district
government office there, union sources said Saturday.
The occupied office is' near the giant Lenin shipyards,
center ' of last summer’s strikes by hundreds of
thousands of workers here and across Poland. The
widening protest in Gdansk came just two days before a
court decision expected Monday concerning a crucial
‘ revision in Solidarity's charter. The union has promised
A renewed strikes if the Polish Supreme Court ruling is not
to their liking. Solidarity, the largest union coalition,
claims to represent some l0 million workers out of a
total work force of 18 million in all sectors and 13
million in the government-controlled sector. Communist
Party membership is believed to be less titan 3 million.

‘ Polish Court Favors Union

WARSAW, Poland (AP) The Polish Supreme Court
ruled today in favor of the nation’s biggest independent
union, registering its charter without a disputed clause
and averting a new wave of strikes. After a session of
nearly three hours, presiding judge Witold Formanski
said the Warsaw district court had exceeded its authority
last month when it added to the charter of the
"Solidarity" trade union a phrase asserting the Corn-
munist Party's supremacy. Formanski said the lower
court had “no right to either cross out any sections of
the charter, nor to add anything." Urtdcr an agreement
reached Sunday at a Solidarity meeting, lawyers for the
union, which claims as members some l0 million of the
country’s 18 million workers, prepared art annex to tire
charter. The annex repeats the legal bases for the uniort.

 

including international labor conventions, the agree.
ment ending the Gdansk area strikes last Augusl’ and
the Polish constitution. Salidarily's leaders had
threatened to strike Wednesday if the high court rc.
jectedktheir appeal, and union leader Lech Walesa was
expected to call off strike preparedness plans at a televis.
ed news conference today. The constitution states the
Communist Party's “leading role" in the building or a
socialist society.

sheep, and rabbits, stayed irt their pens surrounded by
countless tiny hands.

0n the main stage. entertainment ranged from dance
and mintc. to music with SUNYA’s University Singers,
under the direction of Don l-i. Guidolli. Later on in the
