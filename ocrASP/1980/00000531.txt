“WCDB is a good station but it on-
ly reaches the uptown campus. It
doesn't reach a large number of
people.”

Diamond reportedl however. that
WCDB contest winners include
listeners from Troy and Rensselaer.
In addition. Diamond said. he
listens to the station in his
downtown Myrtle Avenue house.

“You need an antennae.” he said. ’
“We're a 10 watt FM radio sta-
tion and we're all student
volunteers." Diamond said. “We
work hard and I think we do a
good job putting on a good show
on campus. But- getting listeners is
hard. We’re non-commercial, so
money is an obstacle. Any beneﬁt
we can use to get listeners is needed.
Co—sponsoring shows is an advan-
tage. We get our names on posters
and marquees. We get first crack at

interviews with the bands.
“You'd think UCB would do
their best to help us.” Diamond

"We didn’t do anything to hurt
WCDB -— not intentionally." UCB
Publicity person Laurie Fruchter
said. “We don't want hard feelings.
There shouldn’t be any. 'They
(WCDB) would do the same."

Diamond said WCDB ls continu-
ing plans to co-sponsor a dance-
party.in a local bar, Hullabaloo.
These plans were made before the
Rockpile incident. he said. .

UCB ﬁrst discussed the idea of
going to another area radio station

members were “surprised and
upset.” Montanaro decided to m
sponsorlthe RockaIe concert with
WQBK last Monday. ..

"We. went to WCDB ﬁrst."
Montanaro said. .

“By having WQBK broadcast to
everyone in the Albany area”, it's
not giving Albany State students a
first crack." Diamond said.

"We want to do what UCB and
the students gain from the most."
Mindlin said. “The more money
saved and the more people reached,
the less money lost. We don’t work
for profits. The more money we
have. the more shows we can put
on."

Montanaro reported that
Rockpile ticket sales have substan-
tially increased since WQBK took‘
on the co-sponsorship. “For exam-

, pie." Montanaro said, “we sold 40

tickets today where we were selling
three a day before.

"This is only a temporary thing
-—— we have to get by," Montanaro
said. “Hopefully we will sponsor
more shows with WCDB in the
future." Montanaro said that no
shows are booked yet for next
semester.

“We wanted WCDB to continue
putting spots on the air and pushing
this concert on campus." Mon-
tanaro said. "We wanted them in.
It was up to them." '

“They said "We could still con-
tinue to pttt spots on the air,” Dia-
mond said. “But WQBK's name
would still he on the posters and the
marquee. I knew I’d walk into the
Campus Center —— where our radio
Station is based -— and I’d see signs
saying 'UCB and WQBK
present—’. pushing another radio
station. It would be like a slap in the
face.

“We're out of this one. We made
the decision." Diamond said.

Albany State Cinema Director
Mike Fried said he asked WCDB
last week to feature a “Who”
special during the week “The Kids
are Alright” movie will be shown.
Albany State Cinema is co-
sponsoring this movie with UCB.
Diamond said he didn’t know it" a
“Who” special could be done due
to the situation with UCB.

Fried 'said. “I don't think we
should stiffer just because UCB is
taking, part III this."

Diamond said, “We are going to
have to rc-evaluate our involvement
with events that UCB co-sponsors
with other groups. That's only a
natural response.

“In the past we would have
welcomed this kind of approach
wholeheartedly. When Mike spoke
to me we were very emotionally ill—
volvetl In this whole thing, and l
was apprehensive." he continued.

“Albany State Cinema should
not stiffer for UCB‘s actions. but
