sat. nite satire

Last week, NBC television
cancelled a “weekend update" elec-
tion special that was to have
featured a reunion of most of the
original stars from the “Saturday
Night Live" TV Show.

NBC said it cancelled the
special because last week’s debate
between Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan caused scheduling problems
which made it impossible to broad»
cast “weekend update" before the
elcctiott.

However, New York‘s 50/10
News quotes NBC insiders as say-
ing the network chief. Fred Silver-
rnarr. cancelled the show mainly
because it was too political.

According to the 80/10 News, one
of the skits was to fcatrrrc a Reagan
look—alike who insisted he was in
favor of women’s rights. The
Reagan look-alike tltcrt said that to
prove his support for women. ltc

I “nifty hustle"?

America’s electronic defense
systems have become'so complex in
recent years that the United States
may be unable to ﬁght a conven-
tional war effectively.

Science magazine reports that
Pentagon leaders came to this con-
clusion after they carried out a'top-
secret computerized war game code-

' named “Nifty Nugget."

The “Nifty Nugget" operation,
conducted for one month during
I978, is said to have involved. 1000
players around the nation who
pretended to wage an all-out war
against attacking forces from the
Warsaw Pact in Europe.

According to. Science. “Nifty
Nugget" was plagued by computer
foul-ups, logistical snarls. and
“great gaps" among the various
players. The magazine says that the
war game produced such extensive
breakdowns in “command and con-
trol" that military leaders suggested
privately that the US. President
must consider the possibility of los-
ittg tltc ttcxl cortvcrrtional war.

Science says the rnairt reason for
the reported breakdown is that US
defense systems, while extensive.
are too sophisticated. and they
don't work together as a coor-
dinated trrtit. '

 

Ill an effort to correct this pro-
lrlcrn. thc l’cntagort reportedly has
been holding private conferences
\\ itlr academic experts irt such fields
as artificial intelligence and even

ncurobiology. According to
.Scrt'ncv, military officials hope to
understand thc way the hurnatt ncr-
\ nus system works so tltcy cart app—
lv that same kittd of teamwork to
the Pentagon’s network of corn-
putcr‘s.

a different cut

Billboard rnagaztnc reports tltal
one of the strangest bootleg tapes
ctcr is being sold by record and tape
piratcs based in Singapore.

The tape is titled “Bob Dylan and
.I Immy Carter." and the
r -‘..trrthori/.ctl recording is said to
feature portions of Carter‘s state of
tire union address last January. plus
a selection of songs lifted from
Dylan's “Live at Budokan" l.p.

Bil/hoard says it's a tnystcry why
Carter's address would be more in
demand in the Far East tltcn in the
US, but thousands of bootleg
copies of the Bob and Jimmy tapes
reportedly are being exported to the
Middle East, Malaysia. and Papua.
New Guinea.
