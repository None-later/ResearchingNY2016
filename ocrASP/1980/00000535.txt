THIS COULD BE YOUR DAY.

"‘5 the day the Air Force ROTC counselors will visit your campus to talk about AFROTC pro-
grams. ' ~

It's the day you can hear more about a two, three or tour-year scholarship that pays all lui-
lion, books and lab lees, plus SIOO each month. It‘s the day you can learn about working your
way to a commission in the Air Force. . and all that goes with it.

It's the day the AFROTC counselor will tell you about 0 great way to serve your country and
yoursell, and about how you can continue work toward an advanced degree after entering oc-
five duty as on Air Force officer. ’

So, when the counselorarrives, ask questions, . .aboul pay. . .promollons. . .opporluni-
lies. . responsibilities. There's no obligation, and you might be getting closer to a scholarship
that will help you reach your goals, no matter how high you've got them set.
