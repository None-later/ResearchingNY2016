was intercepted only once — and it
didn‘t hurt, thanks to the Houston
defense.

With the victory, the Oilers raised“

. No Progress Seen For Paralyzed Sicna Gridd‘er"

(AP) These kinds of tragedies are
always dripping with irony. Like
the musician who gets shoved in
front of a subway train and loses a
hand under the trucks. on the
painter who goes blind front
cataracts.

Or the athlete — like Frank Bicc.
an All-American in club football at
Sienn College and the captain of the
lacrosse team — who was paralyzed
wirile making a routitrc trickle.

“it was the fourth qrrartcr of the
game against St. Jolttt Fisher in
Rochester and we were behind."
said Siena player Mark Morrison.
“Frank was playing free safety.
Their quarterback faded back to
pass and then threw to their receiver
— he‘s named Joe Cntan —— who
was running a fly pattern front the
sidelines toward tltc goal posts.

“Catart caught the bail itr the
middle of the field on about otrr
5-yard lirrc. Tiretr Frank — ire was

an All-American — went to tackle~
him. He ltit hiih right here," Morr-
rison said, pointing toward his right
side just above the ltip. "more with

ltis sltottlder than with his head..

Attd then they botlt went down. it
was a perfect-form tackle. a one-
on-onc tackle.“

Catan got up.

“Frank stayed down," said
another Sicna player. Terry Regan.
“l was really surprised he didn't get
up. The coaches ran otrt to him.
They went out and started to work
on hint and i guess we all felt it was
going to be okay. Frank was such a
good athlete. Tltcrt i heard someone
say he couldn't trrovc his legs. Tltetr
l was scared."

Football players lril and dive and
ratrr and push almost every trrotnctrt
the ball's in play. They train. to
avoid injury when they get rocked
irt the spectacular tackles showrt
to promote football for television.

They can't train to avoid a tragedy.

“They took an awful long time
with him out there. but he was
calm, letting them work on him. i
don't think it hurt him then. 1 guess
it did later at the hospital," said
Regan. who recalls waiting on the
sid'clines of the field in Rochester on
that clear and warm Oct. 4. “Both
teams left the ﬁeld until the am-
bulance came. They carefully put
him on a stretcher. They taped his
helmet down — the whole thing. it
seemed like forever."

Doctors think it will be forever.
A statement issued on Strong
Merrrorial Hospital in Rochester
near the beginning of Bice's stay
was to the point: "Frank Bicc sus-

‘tained a fracture of the ﬁfth cer-

vical vertebra and is paralyzed in his
leg and trrrnk and partially in his
arms. He has had surgery to fuse
several vertebrae in order to
stabilize his neck. The surgery did

not affect his muscular function
and no further surgery is planned."

Since then, doctors at Strong
Memorial say there has been no im-
provement in the 21-year-old's con-
dition. The Manhasset. N.Y..
native will probably be there for at

least six months. and possibly a-

year.

“He was always such a good
athlete — lacrosse, football -— all
the sports." said Bicc's mother,
Margaret. a widow. "He was an ex-
cellent tennis player also. but he
didn't like the one-on-one competi-
tion. He liked the team sports."

Bice's friends and teammates at
Siena. a small private school in the
Albany area. are scrambling to raise
money for his hospital bills. Bice
and his mother had essentially no
insurance to cover the costs of the
accident and since football is a club
sport at Siena funded by the
students, he was not covered by the
kind of university insurance which

insures varsity' players at other
schools. ‘ ’

So far. Dice, senior class presi-
dent at Siena. has refused to talk to
the press about thé' accident.
Friends say his mood is good. and
he still has plans to ﬁnish at Sierra,
possibly by correspondence
courses. and attend law school.
These days. however. friends say he
sits in traction in his Rochester

hospital room and waits for a slot

to open up in Strong Memorial’s
rehabilitation program.

,_“His mood is phenomenal."
Regan said. “Every time we've seen

’him he’s been concerned not about

himself but that we went out of our
way to go out there. He’s just like
the same old Frank, except he
doesn't move as much."'

"it's a bad, bad situation . . . a
terrible situation." said St. John
Fisher Coach Bob Bayer. “But in
football. you take that chance every
time you go on to‘the ﬁeld."

by Sharon Cole

The Albany State women's swim

seventh at ttrost. possibly cvctr
eighth.

Bitrglttttrr cited the team for its
great depth. “All the girls had
outstattding timcs. They really
swam as a team." she said.

The Dane coach likes this type of
nteet the most because of its team
attttosplrere. No one swimmer is
tttrdcr a lot of individual pressure,
and can instead concentrate on
ltelpittg the team.

ltt particular. liingharn wtts pleas-
ed with the relay learn of Sheila
Fitzpatrick. .ioarr Nugerrt. Jeanne
Lardner. and Betsy Kwasttrtttr. who
swam the 800 yardtt‘ccstyle relay.
Their time iii the evcttl. tritre
minutes. 59 seconds. qualified them
by 21 seconds for a spot in tile

 

NYSAIAW Championships to be
held 111 Gettesco in February. “That
is really an outstanding time for so
early in the season." Binghant said.

ltiraca. St. Lawrence, and McGill

they took the top three places in six

of the lerr events. No other team
took first or second place in any of
tire tcrr events. lthaca was very

National Football League—An Aerial Circus

(AP) if you still were wondering
witcthcr the National l-oothttll

consider what rttotc than a hull-

Eight of them threw for more
titan 300 yards. alt exceptional
ttrtrrrbcr for one Sunday. Anti tt
ninth came witltirt t'ivc yttttls of .100.
The NFL doesn‘t kccp such
esoteric records as “most trtrttrtcr-
bucks throwing for 300 or more
yards, one day." but the extent of
the aerial circus cttrr he ttrcttsnted by.

interestingly, that was one of two
games in which both the winning
and losing quarterbacks hit the
300-yatd plateau. .lirtr Hart of the
Cardinals completed 25 of 43 passes
for 344 yards and two 105, but he
never got the chance to improve on
that in overtime. Tire Falcons won
the toss, received the ﬁfth-period
kickoff and nrarclted unimpeded to
their winning TD.

The other twin-3005 came in the
battle of the league's winningest
and losirrgcst teams. Ron .laworski
