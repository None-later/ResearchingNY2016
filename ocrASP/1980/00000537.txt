Two Last Quarter 'TD’s Spearhead
' 28-27 Come-From-Behind Victory

by Bob Bellal‘iore

ORLANDO. Fla. — The Albany
State football team raised nearly
$7.000 selling rafﬂes and sponsor-
ing a show on campus in order to
travel 1100 miles to play a football
game. They did Ira! go to all that
trouble to lose.

Outsizcd. outnumbered, and pro-
bably out-talented. the Danes were
not to be outtlone. Two
torrchdowrrs by fullback Chuck
Priore witltin fotrr minutes. 20
seconds of the final quarter led
Albany to a thrilling, 2tt-27. corne-
from-belrind victory over the
University of Central Florida.
Saturday night in front of over
14,000 people ‘=in the Tangerine
Bowl.

“it (the game) was a classic.
said Albany head football coacli
Bob Ford. “There couldn't have
been nttrctr separating the two
Icarus.”

Early in the game. the Duties
found a lot separatitrg them from
the Knights. though — rtarncly 14
first quarter points by their hosts.

Albany stopped UCF on their
first series. and then moved the hall
frorn the Dane 30 to the Knight
28-yard litre. Brit Dario Arango’s
45-l'icld goal try was short, and
UCF took over. Facing a third

son on the left sideline for 42 yards
and a first down. Five plays later.
tailback Turner Davis ran off right
tackle for the final yard. Witlt Tom
Hungerl‘ord’s kick. UCF led. 7-0.

The Danes next possession nettcd
them minus six yards. and Dave
Hardy’s 34-yard punt put the ball
trrr the UCF 48. Two rrtrrning plays
rnovctl the Knights to the Albarry
46. atrd a pass interference call on
Bruce Collins gave UCF a first
dotvrr on the 40. Culiison was too
long (til a bomb to Sampsori. btrt he

. up a l‘irst-aiiil-goal on the 10. After
a Davis two-yard rtrrr. a five-yard

Cttllisorr keeper‘s put the ball on the
one. Davis got his second
touchdown of the day. Witlr 10
seconds remaining in the opening

14-0 advantage.

and Bob Nearing took it over from
there. Arango‘s extra point was
good. and the Danes cut the lead in
half. 14-7.

The Knights got a big break on.
their next possession when an over-
ly ttggrt..sivc .lcrry Wierzbicki ran
into lrlrrngerford itt punt formation
on a fourth-arrd-sevcn. giving UCF
the ball back. atrd a first dowtr on
the Dane 33.

A broken play lost two for the
Knights. but Ctrllisorr came right
back arid hit .lcff Froelrliclr over the
rrriddle for 13. Fullback Mark
(ioodc ran for six. and Calvin
Bryant went right for five more.
Cttllison then fotrtrtl Sampson opcrt
itr ‘the end zone. and the Knights
went up 21—7.

Albany closed the gap just before
half time with another dose of
Burger’s speed. Taking the pitch
front quarterback Mike l’ior'ito on
the Dane 32. the senior ctr-captain
broke frotn the clutches of UCF
dcfetrsivc back Bruce (.‘rordon on
the 35. and streaked dowrt the
sideline for 68 yards and a
touchdown. making the score
21-14.

in the second half. the Albrttty
4-4 was irrrpcrrctrtthle. save for one
titrrc. Cttllisort put strikes of 27
yards to tight end Mike Carter and
31 yards to l-‘rochlich. and.uppcd
the lent! to 27-14. l‘lungerl‘ortl chose
this tirtrc to miss only his ' .\‘-
tra poittl try in two season. atrtl
opcrrtl the door for tire Albatry
corrrchack. "1 tlorr.‘t know what
happened." said UCF head football
coach Don Jonas. “The kid just
never misses."

That possessiotr was the only
chance the Knights had to score in
the two final quarters. as they never
again entered Dane territory.

“It was a little concerned about
otrr physical condition." Ford
notetl with the Florida heat in rttittd.
“But in the second half. we got the
offense on the field. and by the
fourth quarter. 1 think the pltysicul
corttlitiorrittg began to swing irr our
favor."

The rrrorrrctrtunvbegan to swing
jttst a bit earlier than that.

Albany got the ball with 4:16 to
go itr the third quarter by virtue of a
26-yard punt by Craig Turner. 'l‘lrc
Duties marched dowtt to the UCF
six. and facctl a first-antl-goal. ()n
foru‘th-antl-inchcs. though. Louis
was stopped. Albany didn't score.
brtt they had ctrrotiotr and the clock
both on their side.

UCF got rrowltcrc on their first
series of the fourth quarter. and
was forced to ptrrrt. The l)arre
special teams excelled again. as Don
Bowetr returned Turner's boot 42
yards to the Knight 22. A Fiorito-
to—Br'nce 1)ey touchdown pttss was
nullified by offsetting penalties. btrt
l’riore picked his way through the

Greyhound Will

Beginning in January,
Greyhound Bus Litres will be sen-

SUNYA students at the circle to
transport tlrcrrr to “arty standard
Greyhound destination.” according
to SA (ircylround agent Debbie

SA will sell bus tickets at the SA

“in return for this. Greyhound has
agreed to corrrc up to the SUNY

The buses 'will proceed to tire

“Apathy is a btrtrclr of crap."
said SASU‘s .lrtnicc Fine. “The
future of public education is in the
students. . .tlrc future ol'SUNY is
us."

Former SASU president Sharon
Ward said she was "appalled that
only five rrrcrttbers of the committee
are here;" including the two student
cortrrnittcc members. SA president
Sue (told and Sttrdcrrt Union chair-
pcrsotr Jim Tierney.

Ward pointed ortt that in her
travels across the state she found
that “the smaller catnpttses have
really good student representation
on the University govctnrrtg bodies
in the order of 50 percent."

“A body that titres not represent
is illegitimate," said Ward. “and
eventually either falls apart or is
taken down."

Faculty chairman of the Universi—

- ty Senate lingcnc (lather called the
probletn “a paradox." Asked why
the Senate titres not want student
participation there. the lirrglish
Department professor answered,
“The Senate itself has nothing to do
with its own membership. The issue
is decided by the State University's
faculty bylaws.“

'atl-hoc' study committee was
organized this past summer to cort-
