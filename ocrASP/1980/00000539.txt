Shopping  in City’s Heart

by Sue Smith

Buried in the heart of'Albany is a
corner of magic called Robinson
Square. This historic shopping
center, located on Hamilton Street.
7/10 of a mile from the Empire

M

State Plaza. was rctnodclcd from
the late ninctccnth-ccntury
brownstone Victorian-style homes
and rcscmblcs Boston's Beacon Hill
and Washington D.C.’s

 

Georgetown.

Robinson Square is a place that
allows one to indulge in Godiva
chocolates, country clothing. fresh
flowers. French magazines, cheeses,
art posters. hand-crafted wood-
working, yogurt cookies. antiques,
l'inc dining. and smiling faces.

Walking along the brick-lined.
pavcmcnt with the potted trees and
shrubs on either sidc, shoppers are
warmly invited into the specialized
varicty cach shop offers.

  

Zealous lovers of Albany's history turned a tired city block...

of the ﬁreplace in a 19th-century-
style living room at The Dutch
Trader, a shop designed for the
“Dutch-at-Hcart.” While you’re
then: look for wooden shoes.
Drostc chocolate, and other special
delights.

Le Chocolatler is the shop that,
sends persons of any age back into
childhood days as they walk past
the giant Crayola crayon in the
doorway. Under the mtilTi-shapcd
kitcs that line the ceiling sit shelves
and glass counters overstocked with
chocolates, sweets, cards. and sur-
priscs: chocolate hotlips, Love Lgt-
lets, “the initial of a loved onc'in
purc solid chocolate." small
trashcans filled with London’s
Gourmet .lunkt'ood. chocolate
bingoboards. smiling lollipops, and

Passing through time and
distancc barriers. l’ostcrs Plus
Galleries offers posters for those
searching for Broadway show
posters to others looking for
classical art. This two-ycar-old shop
moved from Central Avenue to
Robinson Square in June I978.
Says the sltnpowncrs' assistant.
“I’coplc touring from all over stop
here. New York State has thc

 

  

, .
highest number of publicly owned
fine art. This really helped us."

Moving from'thc clitc world of
art to the world of downtown ltomc
traditions, one finds Bonnie Cook's
antique shop. The Albany Collec-
tion. According to Bonnie's hus-
band. “She's definitely thc boss. i
just work for her on Saturdays. Sltc
has been specializing in antiques l'or
thrcc years. Hcr spccialitics arc
clothing. dolls. and quilts (although
the store is chock-full of uniquc
items) that she collccts all over thc'
northeast and Europe."

Slcvcn Lobcl was motivated to
opcn The Cheese Connection
because he‘s “never seen a shop like
this.“ This "gourmct's dclight" has
145 diffcrcnl kinds of cltccscs and

“Iiy arty cotnrnon indicators that

Lysaught ruadc his remarks at a

“In I979, tltc average salary lor
nurscs was $6 an hour. litttvc found
that workers in supermarkets can
make as much as $11 an hour, Any

much as nurses is in troublc." he

said. '

Increasing thc size of nursing
classes is no solution. he said.
“They're just running around the
same track. This method just pro-

represents all cheese-producing
countries. Mouth-watering pares.
trufﬂes, and caviar await the crav-
ing pallet.

Pinnochio grccts customers
among the ceramic masks, woven
hangings, and jewelry in The Critt-
works Gallery. Peek in the window
to see the old-fashioned police car.

After gazing. touching. and
browsing through the goods of
Robinson Square's 20 shops. The ‘
Restaurant on Robinson Square
with its hanging palms and woodsy
atmosphere. offers shoppers the
chance for a leisurely break with
reasonably-priced and generously-
portioncd meals.

The wonder of Robinson Square
is that without spending a cent. you
lch you'vc walkcd away with more
than ymt carnc with. For this row of
shops deals with muclt more titan
products. It deals with people ~—
and with history. And once you
know that history, you'll discover
how magical this place is.

Uscwick said lIlL incrcascd business
will hopefully make up for the cost
of running thc scrvicc.

' “lnctcuscd ridership affects the
quality of the bus service. if people
really use this service. we may cx-
pand it," Uscwick said. He then-
tioncd the possibility that extra
dircct lines to Long island and New
York City may be added.

Another reason for the shuttle
service. 'l‘rpcgcr said, is to mttkc
everyone more aware of Truilways
service, especially the new routes
westbound.

in addition. Trocgcr said similar
student shuttles have worked :x-
trcmcly well in Oncontu and Delhi.
“Students mean a lot to us. On
wcckcnds they are 50 percent of our
business. We hope to increase this
percentage."
