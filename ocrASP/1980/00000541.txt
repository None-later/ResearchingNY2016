granny bashing

The Los Ange/05 Tunes reports In
that “granny bashing" is a serious. J

growing problem nationwide.

“Granny bashing" is a form of
domestic violence‘that involves
adult children beating tireir aged
parents senseless; and Richard

island researcher, says tlrat at least
half-a-miiiion aged Americans are
physically abused bytTreir .farnilics
every year. '

 

in one case. Tlie Times says. a
nineteen-yeanold woman beat her
81-year-old father witir a hammer
and then chained hint to a toilet for
seven days. in another case, a
74-year-old woman was kept locked
in the basement and was beaten by

her family whenever she tried to r

“unusual. according to Helen

O’Mallcy. a rcscarchcd with Boston
Elderly Services. O'Mally says.
“We've found that in most cases
there was unreasonable confine-
mcnt. over-sedation and even sca-
tial abuse."

Maggie Kuhn, founder of the
Militant Senior Citizens Group,
The Gray Panthers. says adult
children who beat their parents
often are under the stress of caring
for the agctl patent—a stress which
cart eventually lead to anger.
frustration and violence.

liollowing its political success in
the recent national clccrions, the

llrcast cancer is reportedly
spreading to wotttctt of all age

'I‘lru ( ‘iiicugtr ’l‘riinuii' reports that
- doctors attending a conference of
the American College of Surgeons
expressed concern that breast
cancer. which once primarily struck
women over 40. is now striking
women under fit).
The newspaper says. in fact. that
doctors at i:\'ittlslott Hospital in il-

 

linois. recently diagnosed breast.

cancer in an 11-year-old girl. believ-

get the disease.

Doctors. says The Tribune, at-
tribute‘rising breast cancer rates to
high fat diets and the fact that
women are postponing child bear-

rcducethe risk of breast cancer.

However, The Tribune says the
case of the li-year-oid.girl may be
the start of a new. unexplained
trend in younger breast cancer vic-
tints.

Should candidates running for
President'of the United States be re-

problems they have?

Most doctors apparently are
against this idea. More tir'nn half of
550 physicians questioned in a poll

oppose the passage of any law that
would require US Presidential citri-
