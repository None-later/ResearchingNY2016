BlbeuLinumea

 

it was the 90th day without a woman and
Eb was forlorn. How was he to break such a
streak? Maybe It was In the stars. or maybe In
his hair.

So Eb grubbed up three-fifty and went
across the street to Sam the Barber. Eb
always felt sorry for Sam the Barber because
every time he walked by and looked In the
window. Sam would be sitting alone In the
dimly lit shop reading the paper. Every time
Eb walked by. Sam would look up from
reading the paper, thinking he had a
customer. But Eb would always speed up his
pace and look away.

But today was different. Today Eb would
walk by the little shop and when Sam looked
up from reading the paper. Eb would smile
and walk in. Yes. today Sam the Barber
would have a customer.

Unfortunately. It was Sunday
and Sam was closed on Sunday.
Eb's haircut would _have to wait
another 24 hours.

But Eb, being Eb. forgot all
about the haircut on Monday. in-

problem was the way he dressed.
Maybe. just maybe. girls weren't
turned on by ripped jeans and
Tshlrts. Eb didn't take this notioti
too seriously. but then again, 90
days was a long time. Eb thought.
"What the hell. Gotta try
something."

Tuesday dawned murky. it had
been raining all night and today
promised to be the same. But Eb
was determined to go throuin with
the new approach. He was going
to try a whole new routine. He
woke up. actually showered and
shaved; borrowed Joe—his-

Cal Klein sweater. brushed his teeth, match-
ed his socks and tied his sneakers. A quick
glance in the rust and spit framed bathroom
mirror gave him the encouragement he
needed. it was sure to work.

Eb even felt different. He was reborn. He
was also ten minutes late for class. Grabbing
his jacket. he dashed madly out the door.
Just as Eb was ﬂying out the door. a logger
was running at full speed up the street. The
two collided. sending the Jogger Into the
bushes and Eb Into a fresh. oozing puddle of
thick mud. The bags of garbage he knocked
over In flight ripped open and coated him
like papier mache. Slowly. he struggled to
his feet and two blocks away. a little old lady
cringed at the echo of Eb's profanity.

it was the 104th day without a woman and
Eb was getting desperate. He'd tried

everything. He'd even gone to a Colonial
Quad party. He was about to abandon all
hope when something happened. it was,
right after Felix's back gave out and Oscar
was going to have to cook in the contest
when Joe-the-roommate made the brilliant
observation: “Hey, Eb. i think It's those
sleazy )olnts you been hanging out at."

"Yeah?" ' -

“Yeah.”

A little lightbulb went off in Eb's brain.."0f
course!" he thought. “it's those sleazy iolnts l
been hanging out at!" Suddenly. It was all so
obvious! The reason Eb hadn't met any do.
cent women was because Eb was never In
any decent places. No more sleazy bars for
him; from here on in it would be at least third
class all the way.

The following Saturday was beautiful.
Everyonewas going to a weekend-

 

 

long multi-keg party at Dipplkill.
Everyone except Eb. With clean
clothes and clean nails. Eb was off
to the library. With his accounting
text tucked safely under his left
arm. and My Secret (Burden under
the right. Eb trotted uptown. He
had blow~dried his hair to that
looks-windblown-but-stlll-neat
stage. His shoes matched and he
felt confident. He had even
mastered some library opening
lilies the night before. His favorites
were. “i can really relate to
Raskolnlkov. you know?" and "I
Just love that soft buzzing of the
lights. don't you?"

Eb got off at the gym. even
though Dutch would have been
closer. Bill Eb always got off at the
gym. because he hoped the
girls on the bus would think.

town quads. my life would he in peril. l fled
eastward. toward Alumni. it was here i
found something amazing about this tiny lit»
tle island In a swamp of lower middle class 
the food here isn't that bad!

Let me qualify this. i do not mean that it is
any different from the food uptown. nor do I
claim that it is of better quality. What Is so
pleasing about this food is that it tastes like it '
has been prepared individually. not by the
hundreds.

My first meal was lunch. There were the

welners and pot pies. i took my usual double
decker hamburger and went to the condi-
ment counter to get my chopped onions and
Russian dressing. Filling two glasses of soda
water (the only substitute for Perrier). I took

   
  

my seat. .unaware of what was to Come.

My first bite was a shock. i didn't have to
rip and tear the meat off the pattie like an
ape with a gazelle part. The meat was actual-
ly pink and almost tender. it tasted like real
ground beef. The dressing was perfectly
blended and not acidic, it was rapture.

l gambled that something else might taste
just as good. Swiftly I went to the soup
cauldron. before someone woke me from
this dream. It was vegetable soup. Real.
fresh. honest vegetable soup. I returned to
my seat and couldn't help but cry out in
delight at the taste. Not that it was a con-

quest in chowderdom or bisque-making. but
It far exceeded my expectations.

i finally settled down and began to ex-
amine my surroundings. The first feature I
noticed was the ceiling. it was clean. made of
acoustic tile. and not covered with
mysterious white squares (inverted butter
patties). Hanging from these ceilings were
chandeliers. Although they were not crystal
(they had gaudy little brass shades on each
of the bulbs). they were a welcome relief
from those god-awful flying saucer light fix-
tures which plague the uptown quads.

The people that dine here are another in-
teresting feature. Although they appear to be ‘
no different from other students. their dining
behavior was quite the opposite of their up-
town brethren. l noticed a perceptibly lower
noise level and a generally more relaxed at-
titude about their seating These students

wrestler. Girls were always impressed by
swimmers or wrestlers, at least the girls Eb
always met. That was how he met Flo: he
had'lled and told her that he was a varsity
wrestler. But Flo found out he was lying
when she pinned him once in a minute and a
half.

Besides. the brisk walk to the library would
redden his cheeks and give him that out-
doorsy look.

Eb was surprised at how crowded the
library was. But then, the last time Eb had
been to the library was three years ago dur-
ing orientation. Somehow. It didn't look

. familiar.

There were no seats In the lounge. so Eb
found a desk in the back. Opening his ac-
counting book. Eb looked around. surveying
the territory. Nothing. Maybe this wasn't the
way to go about It. Maybe he should just go
back to ——

Suddenly. a beautiful female caught Eb's
eye. Interrupting his train of thought and
causing a small atnount of splttle to seep

from his lip and run down his chin. The _

leinale sat down next to him. smiling. Eb
wiped his chin conspicuously. He was smil-
iiig’. too. Leaning closer. she whispered.
“Are you studying for the test In 211?" Eb's
lips formed the word "yes" but his vocal

cords forgot to send up the appropriatev

sound. Nothing came out. Eb felt foolish sit-
ting there. nodding his head. mouthing the
word "yes". But the female didn't seem to
notice. She was too busy bending over.
reaching for the textbook. Eb. in his excite-
ment. blurted something about Edgar Allen
Poems, astro-physlcs and how he preferred
black holes. The woman in Eb's accounting
class flashed a long. cold look as she hasten-
ed away. -

chew their food more slowly and drink by
sipping and not guzzling. Theirs was an at-
titude of feeding their bodily temples rather
than nuzzling slop as fast as they could.

i mentioned before that the food is
markedly better. This i do not attribute to
some magical skill on the part of the cooks at
Waterbury. but rather to the fact that the por-
tions they must cook are smaller and.
therefore, are cooked in a more common
fashion. i would guess that these chefs stir
their soups and sauces with spoons and not
