She had with her documents the
had taken concemlng the plant at
which she worked. For six weeks,
she had’becn on special assignment
for the OCAW, investigating ac-
cusations that the plant was
violating Atomic Energy Commis-
sion (ABC) regulation and jeopar-
dizing the health of its employees:-

But Silkwood never reached her
destination. Her car crashed and
she was instantly killed.

“It's suspicions that Silkwood’s
car went off at the left side of the
road." offered Hagcr. as he ended
the controversial story of Karen
Silkwood.

Although it was ruled by the
Oklahoma highway patrol that
Silkwood had fallen asleep at tltc
wheel of her car. Hagcr presented
substantial evidence that this was
no accident.

He noted that dents were found
by private investigators, hired by
lhc OCAW. in the buck buntpcr

Silkwood drove. This. Huger ca-

Silkwnod‘s family brought suit

lamination. A jury asserted that tiic
contamination was inlcntionul and

nwnrdcd $10.5 million in punitch
donutch to her family.

Soon after. Kcrr-Mchc was shut
down by tlic Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. as they were responsi-
blc for more than 500 violations.
Hagar said. ‘

He added that a second case.
which deals with the cause of
Silkwood's accident six years ago
yesterday. is still in appcal.

“We’re trying to prcscrvc thc
meniory of Karen Silkwood."
Hztgcr strcsscd. "She was ordinary.
"torn! and right - and she (iicd for
it." lic said. "but she was not the
