a state of mind. wliere"'enough of

the owners feel. ‘this isthe right
time.’ "

if expansion is a state of mind.
realignment is a state of siege. in
1969. as part of the merger. it took
three marathon sessions to achieve
the present format. with Baltimore,
Cleveland and Pittsburgh. three of
the old NFL clubs. finally agreeing
to join the American Football Cori-
fer'ence. the 10 teams which had
been the American Football
League. Rozelle almost had to lock
the owners iii a room and keep it
locked ttiitil they catne up with the
plrtti.

The expansion field is limited to

 

perhaps a half-dozen cities.~»wlth
Birmingham. Jacksonville. Mem-

phis and Pheonix as the most likely. '

lndianapolis and Honolulu as out-
siders. 'Los Angeles also is a
possibility. depending on the
resolution of litigation between the
NFL and the Oakland Raiders
who‘d love to be the LA Raiders.

Just for the record, here's one
man's prospective lineup for a new.
improved, regionalized. six-
division. one-conference NFL:

Northeast Division: Baltimore.
New England. NY. Giants. N.Y.
Jets arid Washington. East Divi-
sioti: Buffalo. Cincinnati,
Cleveland. Philadelphia and Pitt-
sbtirglr.

“ Page Fifteen

Central Division: Chicago.
Denver. Detroit. Green! Bay and
Minnesota.

South Division: Atlanta. Miami.
NeW'Orleans. Tampa Bay and Bir-
mingham or Jacksonville or Mem-
phis. ‘

Southwest Division: Dallas.
Houston. Kansas City. St. Louis
and Phoenix.

West Division: .Los Angeles.
Oakland. San Diego, San Francisco
and Seattle.

Sound reasonable?

Well. forget it. Realignment to
regional divisions is about as dead
as New Orleans' chances of winning

~tlie Super Bowl this year.
