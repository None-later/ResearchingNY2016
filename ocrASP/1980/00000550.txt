Under any other circumstances,
there is no way that you’d ﬁnd me
on a freezing SUNY bus at four in
the morning. sMere on the
New York State Thruway between
.New York and AlbanyxBut these
were not "any other cir-
cumstances."

‘ I i can still feel the 89 degree sun

beating 'down on Walt Disney
World. and on my back at the same
time. 7 -

i also can't remember the last
time i got thrown into a swimming
pool in’ the second week of
November and didn’t really mind.

Never did i think that a bunch of
18 to 25-year oids ‘would be so

amazed at watching the'lights on
the streets of Queens. NY. from
20,000 feet. "Fasten Your Seat
Belt" signs became optional as far
as they were concerned, because the
view from the Eastern airplane was
just too much to pass up. And a lit-
tle flight regulation wasn't about to
stop anybody.

i didn’t think l’d ever see a
220-pound football player get such
a kick out of taking a snapshot of
Winnie the Pooh. -

And the Tangerine Bowl — well,
what had happened there earlier
that same night had made it all

possible. Because, at about 11:00

the Danes had won their most thrill-
ing game of the season, coming
from behind in the fourth quarter
to beat their most gracious hosts.
the University‘ of Central Florida,
28-27. '

The game was the most impor-
tant reason for the trip, as Albany
head coach Bob Ford emphasized
the entire week before at practice.
and throughout the game up until
the final gun went off. But there
were so many other things besides a
football game. '

How many guys thougltt. when
they decided to play football for
Albany. that they would play in a
48.000 seat stadium that was the
ltome of a major college bowl
game?

And how many guys thought that
they would play ilt Florida? '

And when they did play, it was
easily their ntost inspired arid most
intense performance of a very tip-
artd-down seasott. The trip was the
biggest utip" possiltlc.

You could hear the ladies sigh
from all the way across the room.

Cooney, aitht5ugh 6-fcet-6 and
225 pounds, is not exactly the pro-
totype ofa ring hero which we have
come to accept from a 20-year
association with bombastic
Muhammad Ali and slightly less
with the celluloid's Sylvester
Stallone.

in four years. most of them in
virtual obscurity. he has battled his
way to no. i contender in the
heavyweight division. the logical
next foe for either Larry- Holmes.
the World Boxing Council
titleholder. or the World Boxing
‘Associatiion champion, Mike
Weaver.

But. to most of the country. ltc
remains a virtual nonentity.

This time, young Cooney didn't
shove and push his way tltrongh
New York's perilous transit syslent
Wednesday noon on a mission of

ﬁstic violence. He came to be
honored because he is nice to kids.

While guests washed down their
hamburgers and french-fries with
New York bubbly, Cooney was
presented a symbolic spatula on a
plaque memorializing him as the
“Big Mac Biggie."

it’s an award given by the
McDonald's hamburger chain not
for disposing of ring opponents but
for community service. in Cooney's
case, it was tribute for contribu-
tions to youth development in his
hometown and other charitable
works. .

A correspondent from Ring
Magazine enlivened the proceedings
by reminding Cooney that Holmes
had termed him the "White Hoax"

. Page Nineteen"

“The Great ,WhiteHo’ax?”

instead of the “White Hope" and
there were golng'to be a lot of
“white dopes" if anybody thought
the kid could take Holmes' crown.

‘_‘i don’t like Holmes," Cooney
said aeldiy. “i met him four years
ago. i was still an amateur. just a
kid. He treated me like dirt. He’s
got a big mouth. He's got no
class.”

it's different with Weaver.

“He's a nice guy." Cooney said;

"Doesn't talk too much."

“Which had you rather ﬁght?"
someone asked.

"Makes no difference. whichever
comes first." the young contender
said. “Bill not All. He was great for
boxlrtg — lte ought to quit."

To Host Annual NCAA RegiOnal Meet

“i feel very happy about hosting
the meet. We have forty people
working to run this meet. it has to
be run well and ritn right." said
Albany men's cross country coach
Bob Munscy.
