Skidmore Little Match For Women Swimmers

The Albany State women's swim
team was supposed to have a tough
meet but that wasn’t exactly the
way it turned out. Instead. the
Danes rolled right over their op-
ponents from Skidmorc, 9345.
Last week. Albany coach Sarah
Bingham had said that she expected
the meet to go down "to the last
relay." but Albany. as it turned
out. led the meet all the way and
was never seriously challenged.

The small Skidmorc team lacked
the great depth of the Albany team
as they only entered one or two
swimmers in each event.
“Obviously we had the great depth
and numbers. but we also won most

test “a good meet." but knows that
the Danes will have to be tough to
overcome their next opponent.
()ncontrt. The meet is scheduled for
December 5 at 7:00 p.tn.. in Univer-
sity l’ool.

“()nconlu beat us by 28 points
last year." said liinghum. “but l'm
hoping that this year's match will be
a close one and that we'll conn- out
on top."

Season Comes To A'Scr‘eeching Halt

"It's very dcprcssing." said
Albany volleyball coach Pat Dwycr.
“The pressure was just too much.
The whole atmosphere on the learn
was very tense. Only,whcn the tert-
sion was removed did we play
well."

Albany showed no signs of the
nvcrconl‘idcnce thanhad plagued
them earlier this season. Their pro-
blems stemmed from their lack of
experience in the high pressure tour-
nament environment.

“Part of it was the finality of it
all. it was the extra pressure they
put on themselves. What they need

is more experience in situations like
these. it's at different kind of al—
mosphcrc," vayer noted.

Sixteen teams competed in the
tournament and they were divided
into four round robin pools with
the top two learns in each pool go-
ing to the winner‘s bracket and the
bottom two to tire laser‘s bracket.
Albany topped their pool. which
consisted of Rochester. Oncontu.
and Buffalo.

in their first match, Albany lost
to Rochester in two games. 15-4.
15-1 1. “We were very nervous. but
Rochester was rt better learn," ad-
mitted Dwycr.

The next contest against
Oncontu would decide Albany's
fatc - if they lost it would be the

end of any hope of them making the .

winner's bracket. Tile Dragons
crushed the Doncs' hopes, 15-3,
15—4. “We completely fell apart.
We were out 01' it at that point,"
said l)wycr.

Their final bottt in the round
robin was against previously
undcl'cttlcd Buffalo but. with tire
pressure off. Albany rompcd, 15-3.
15—4. '

overpowering."

Although the year ended on a
sour note, the spikcr's have nothing
to be ashamed of. After a slow
start, they won 22 of their lost 24
games and ended the scuson last
Wednesday by allowing RPI only
one poirtt irt tlu'cc gutncs. Those
were the high poirtts of the year. ac-
cordirtg to Dwycr.

In addition. the tram missed be-
ing selected to the Eastern
Regionals by only one place (they
were ranked 17th).

“1 think we had a great year."
Dwyer said. “They really played
well. I saw great improvement in
everybody.”

The Dunes will lose only one
player to graduation. captain Ann
Carberry. and should be much im-
proved next year. “Next year we
should make the Regionals."
Dwycr predicted. “We should have
an excellent team."
