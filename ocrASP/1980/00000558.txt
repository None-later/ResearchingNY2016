Chiefs Overcome 17-Point .
' Albany Advantage; Win 28-17

by Bob Bellaﬂorc

' the year was going for the Danes.

then all you ltad to do was be at
University Field Saturday after-
noon and you got a composite pic-
ture of tlte whole situation. And if
you’ve been following them all
year. it was just like a summary at
the end of a textbook chapter.

After A mounting a l7-0 first
quarter lead. the Danes just seemed
to fall apart. Springfield capitalized'
on a few breaks. made two big
plays. chipped away at Albany's ad-
vantage. and came back to defeat
the Danes, 28-17. I

“That ballgame typifies our
whole season," said Albany head
football coach Bob Ford.

It was a fitting ending to a dread-
fully inconsistent Season for the
Danes. '

There were the great parts. ltt tltc
first [2 minutes. 40 seconds of the
game, Albany pttt 17 points on the
board on three consecutive posses-
sions. stunning their Division ll op-
ponents, and making it look as if a
blowout was in store.

Albany rcceit'red tltc opening
kickoff, but couldn't produce.
Dave Hardy's 52 yard purtt was
taken on the bounce by chief Bob
Gcrena. who found a gaping hole in
the middle, and returned it 35 yards
to the Albany 47 yardline. Four
runs put the ball on the 29, but
tailback Bob Cioffi coughed it up
on tltc next down. and defensive
end Tom Pinto recovered on the 25.

Ford decided to pull the stops out
early. On the first play. senior co-
captain Jack Burger was sprung for
28 yards by :1 Glen Magrone block
on a split ertd reverse. Chuck Priorc
got three. Levi Louis went off
tackle for two more. and a Mike
Fiorito to Tint Votraw pass netted

 

r Albany

seven. Bob Nearing ran for 17 and

wide open Bruce Dcy behind Den-
nis Parent on lltc left side. and
Albany struck first. with 8:42 left iii
the first quarter. Dario Arango's
kick was good. and the Danes led.
7-0.

On Albany's next possession.
Ford again reached ittto his reper-
tiorc of trickery for has first play:
Burger took the ball on what ap-
peared to be an end-around. but
threw to Dcy for a 27-yard gain.
putting the ball on the Clticf 22.
After a run and an incomplete pass
had gotten nowhere. Dcy made his
third reception of the game with a
tough grab on a look-in from
Fiorito for nine yards. Arango then
hit a 31-yard field goal, and Albany
led. lO-O.

Things looked even better for the
Danes when sub punter Norm
English booted one off the side of
his foot front the Springﬁeld 30 that
hit on the Chief 47 and took an
Albany bounce back to the 37. giv-
ing the Danes prime field position.

Burger ran left for three yards.
and a Fiorito-to-Burger pass got
nine tnore. Two counter plays. one
by Nearing for tltrce. and one by
Louis for l2 gave the Danes a first-
and-goal on the IO. Fiorito then hit
Dcy on a simple straight pattern for
tltc second scoring connection of
the afternoon. It was Dey's fourth
catch of the game. giving him 23
receptions for tltc season. and a ttcw
record. breaking Scott
Lusher’s mark of 22. set in I977.
The Danes wcttt up. l7-O. with 2:20
still to go itt the first quarter.

“Dcl'cnsivcly, we had a hell-of-
a-lot of intensity in the first
quarter. The Chief multiple set of-
fense was only able to notch thrcc
first dowtt in those initial l5

minutes. and threatened once — on

 

 

 

their opening series.

Howard Vandersca. “They ﬁness-
ed us in the ﬁrst quarter."

But that was it for the Danes.
who seemed to get infected by the
inconsistency that has plagued them
since day one. Witlt the beginning
of the second quarter, Albany
began making costly errors. and
Springfield took advantage.

The first mistake happened on a
second-and-eight from the Albany
22. On the triple option. Fiorito at-
tempted to pitch to Nearing around
the right end. but the ball hit the
ground. and Nearing had to cover
up way back on the seven. Two
plays later. Hardy came in to punt
from the to, and Ciofﬁ called for a
fair catch on the Dane 39.

The Chiefs wasted no time. On
their ﬁrst play. Cioffi, who came
off the bench to run for 84 yards
last week against Wagner, slid
through the right side. broke a
tackle. and turned on the burners.
outracing the pursuit for 39 of his
l56 total yards. and Springfield‘s
ﬁrst score. Jeff Bennett hit the
extra point. making it l'l-7. t.

The second big miscue came
under similar circumstances. 0n the
Albany 26. Fiorito and Nearing
again couldn‘t connect on a pitch.
but Chief linebacker and All-
American candidate Doug McKen-
ney pounced on the ball on the 14.
Quickly. quarterback Jim Collis hit
a leaping Jon Cherry in the end
zone. Bennett was good with the
kick. cutting the Dane lead to
l7-l4. which was where it stood at
the ltalf.

Albany did have one more shot
before halftime. Burger took Joe
PingatorL-‘s bouncing kickoff on
the Dane 12, and bolted through
the middle. Gcrena. the only Cltief
between Burger and six points.

played it perfectly, and made a
touchdown saving open ﬁeld tackle
on the Springfield [4. Nearing ran
the middle for one. and then came
the blunder. Burger tried the option
pass one more time, but he threw
into a crowd in the end zone. and
Parent picked it off to kill the
throat.

“I should have told Jack
‘whatcvcr you do. don‘t throw the
interception’." Ford said in ltind-
sight. The Dane coach thought that
this was one of the crucial plays
that snuffed out his team‘s chances.
"l thought that was a good play."
he continued. “The bad thing was
the result."

The third quarter saw no change
in the score, but Albany did get a
bit ofluck. With a first-and-goal on
the eight. Cioffi fumbled into the
end zone, and Don Bowen
recovered for the Danes.

At the end of that period. facing
a fourth-and-onc on the Chief 31.
Ford elected to let the clock run out
so Arango could attempt a 44-yard
ﬁeld goal with the wind at his back.
but he was wide anyway.

Albany only ltad one more real
chance to score. After going frortt
tltc Chief 47 to the 22. Nearing. on
a straight ahead dive play. fumbled
the ball. got it back, but lost it. and
Springfield's Frank Moncllo
recovered on the 14.

On the ensuing drive. the Chiefs
marched 86 yards in 13 plays. to go

able to put together some 'kind of
offense." Ford said. "I thought it
was all wrapped up at that point —-—
I thought it was in the bag."

"i thought our offensive line did

a good job. and the defense in the l

second half played like they could
play.“ Vandcrsea said. “And we
did it into the wind in the second
half."

“Springﬁeld is just a good Divi-
sion ll football team."said
Albany's All-American candidate
Steve Shoen. "They knew what
they had to do. and they did it."

So while Albany ends its season
at 5-5. Springﬁeld is is hoping to get
a post-season bid. “We‘ve shown
that we've got character.“
Vandersea said. "i don't know
what more you's have to do to
qualify for the playoffs.“

“I‘m not sure ifit was a matter of
them outplaying us." Ford noted.
“or Of us just beating ourselves.
We've just had trouble putting
whole ballgamcs together."
