Stopping By The Woods on A snowy Eaénin

Whose. woods these are I think I know.
His house is in. the village, though;

He will not see me stopping here v

To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

pholos by Dave Asher
He gives his harness bells a shake ‘
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound’s the sweet
‘ Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,

And miles to go before I sleep,

And miles to go before I sleep.

-— Robert Frost
