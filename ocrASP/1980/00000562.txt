' AlbumsHiﬂing RecordPriCes

by Matt Haddad

The cost of records, petroleum
based products, have increased
dramatically with the rise of oil
prices. Album prices have climbed
steadily through the 70’s and at pre-
sent list for $8.98. Some experts
believe that the $12.98 album will
be standard before the end of the
decade.

Many shoppers. in light of such
inﬂation, have cut down their
album consump'iion considerably.
Many others. however, addicted to
record buying, would rather starve
than stop buying albums. If you are
one of these insatiable discophiles,
then maybe this guide to record
stores in the Albany area could help
you eat a little better.

Of course, the most accessible
record store for the SUNYA stu-
dent is the Record Co-op, situated~

on the second floor of the Campus
Center, next door to the Food
Co-op. its most redeeming quality
is obviously its location. The prices
are also pretty good, averaging ap-
proximately $5.95 for new releases,
$4.95 for slightly older cuts, and
$2.00 to $3.00 for older albums that
the average collector has no use for.

However, shopping at the Record
Co-op is a frustrating experience
because of the lack of selection in
rock ‘n' roll and even more meager
stock of jazz (forget the classical).

if you are searching for a specific
album and don’t mind paying a
buck or so extra, try Record Town
or Just A Song. Record Town,
located in the Northway Mall, is a
large commercial store, very
reminiscent of Record World, with
an adequate selection of rock ‘n’
roll, a fair selection of jazz, and a
crude stock of classical.

Just A Song, located on Central
Avenue. has a large selection of

rock ‘n' roll, a good stock of jazz,
and an adequate collection of
classical. LP prices in both stores
are only fair.

Midland Records, located in Col-
onie Shopping Center and Midway
Music in the Northway Mail are two
avoidable record stores. Not only is
the selection very poor, but the
prices are 'odtrageously high.
Possibly the only redeeming quality
of Midland Records is its nice stock
of rock posters. ' _

If you don't mind buying used
albums, World Records on 22 Cen-
tral Avenue has a very large selec-
tion of rock LPs for under $3.00.
Some of these albums are in better
condition than others, so be sure to

Univ. Senate Referendum Proposed

by Beth Sexer

The committee on Nominations
and Elections has released a non-
binding referendum this week to
SUNYA faculty listing several op-
tions concerning the status of
students on the Senate.

The options include making
students permanent members, ad-
justing the number of student and
graduate student members. and
converting the Senate “to a purely
faculty governance body."

Based on the results of this
referendum, to be completed by
November 24, a second referendum
will be issued. The information
gathered will help the committee
present well-deﬁned options for a
faculty vote, explained SA Presi-
dent Suc Gold.

Last night Senate Liaison Mark
Lafayette and Gold held an open
meeting for senators and other in-
lcrcslcd individuals to discuss which
referendum option to lobby in
favor of, and how to present their

arguments to the faculty.
Lafayette mentioned at the
meeting that WCDB is sponsoring a
debate on the issue of student
representation on the University
Senate.

Students Claim Police Harassment

continued from from page

Garcia, a senior, approached one
of the ofﬁcers to ask what was hap-
pening as Ramcc was grappling with
the two ofﬁcers after the lD check.
"The officer pushed me off," he
said. “The guy they were trying to
hold onto got away and ran around
the bus.

"He was saying, ‘What's going
on? Why are you giving me a hard
tirnc?‘ i got on the bus then. and

  

 

 

the next thing i saw. there were
three or four officers holding him,
one with his fingers through
Ramcc‘s hair, pushing his head on
the hood of the car. His two friends
were being handcuffed and held
against the other side of‘tltc car."

The witnesses all stated they felt
the three youths were physically
abused by the arresting officers.

Levy called a meeting with
chighan, Public Safety Director
James Williams. and Vice President
for Business and Finance Hartigan
to “find out what the story was,
and voice my disgust on behalf of
the student body at this incident,"
he said.

“We had basically the same
story, but Henighan said the police
were right. He said they had to be
physical because the students were
drunk. i said they weren't justiﬁed.
i saw it, and i said, ‘This can't be
right.’ I didn’t talk to anyone who
didn't walk away without a pit in
his stomach."

Garcia said he hopes other
witnesses will come forward so that
something might be done concern-

,ing the case.
