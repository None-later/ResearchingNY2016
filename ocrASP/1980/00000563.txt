. November 21, 1980 '
cold comfort

An‘ English doctor has some
rather cold comfort for people with
the snifflcs; he says people who stay
home from work sick with a cold
are goldbricking.

Dr. Adrian Rogers. showing a
singular lack of bedside manner.
writes in the medical newspaper
Pulse that. “The patient will be no
more comfortable resting at home
than at work."

 

Rogers dismisses the common ex-
cuse that fellow workers might
catch the sufferer’s cold, saying this
rarely happens. He says that doc-
tors who hand out “sick notes" for
common colds are just trying to get
rid of a patient fast. The doctor in-
sists that his view is nothing to
sneeze about.

,bonzo’s back.

Bonzo — it tttrns out —— was a
lady.

Bonzo. the chimp who co-starrcd
in the l95l tnovic “Bedtime for
Bonzo" with President-elect
Ronald Reagan. was billed as a
male chimp ofsuperior intelligcttcc.

maggot of ‘a pro-
fessor trying tolteach Bonzo in the
film.

Reagan. however, has finally ad-
mitted that “Bonzo was a girl."
Reagan said on a,United Airlines
flight on election eve that “Bonzo
wore a piece of monkey for in a
‘critical place to hide the fact that
she wasn't the right gentler."
Bonzo apparently didn‘t take
very kindly to Reagan or her
gender-change. The President-elect
says the chimp once nearly st rangi-
ed him when he happened to lean
over her cage and she grabbed his
necktie. To his alarm. Bonzo pulled
the tie until the knot was as small as
his fingernail. Says Reagan. “They
had to cut the tie."

record rlpnoff I

Here's a sign of the times: the SIG
LP has arrived.
MCA records has released the

I ﬁrst studio album in that label's

.history that contains a suggested
retail list price of $9.98. or two
cents short of $10.

The double digit LP is Steeley
Dan's album titled “Gaucho.”

 

Albany Student Press

‘Earlier this year, MCA ofﬁcials’
had predicted that the $9.98 LP
would arrive sometime in l98l. but
it’s here earlier than expected.

Even though the album carries a
ten dollar price tag, most con-
sumers can buy it for much less;
that’s because most record stores
sell their new LP's at discount
prices.

irock‘n’roll forever '

Bil/board magagine says that
many rock industry leaders are
predicting a crackdown on rock and
roll music. in the Wake of Ronald
Reagan's landslide victory.

The magazine says that several
big name rock managers are par-
ticularly concerned about a possible
crusade on the part of the Moral
Majority to “clean up" the music
business.

Steve Leber and David Krebs are
the managers of such acts as
Acrosmith. Ted Nugent and
lAC/DC and they are predicting
“The Moral Majority (will) try to
shut down the ‘devil's trilateral
commission‘ of sex, drugs and rock
'n roll."

'Other executives interviewed by
Bil/board predicted that record
companies will become more con-
servative in the kind of music they
attempt to market because of
pressure from Washington and
from religious groups.

However, Jerry 'Jaffe, the presi-
dent of Polygram Records has the
opposite viewpoint; .laffe insists
that Reagan and the Moral Majori-
ty will be good for the rock music
industry. '

.laffe predicts that rock will offer
a “great alternative" to the right
wing. .laffe says. “I think this new
regime will foster a reaction, and
orchestrating this reaction will be
rock. i think a new American sound
that will be very punk and hard will
be present shortly. There will be a
crisis that will precipitate it. like in
the ’60’s."

food fads

Last year's trendy foods. such as
quiche lorraine and crepcs. may be
on the way out.

For example.‘ a successful
restaurant in Dallas says black-eyed
pea sandwiches — with red onion
on cornbread -'— are fast sellers;
while an eatery in Philadelphia says
its customers are drawn to spiced up
vegetable dishes.

And last. but not least. the
magazine says. get ready for

. Chinese seafood tacos.

do you know?

A poll by an organization called
“Resources for the Future” has
discovered that only one in four,
Americans knows what acid rain is, ;

and that even fewer know what'

happened at Love Canal, New
York.

The poll. sponsored by the White
House Council on Environmental
Quality. found continuing support
for protection of the environment
despite widespread ignorance of en-
vironmental facts.

For those who don't know. acid
rain is formed when acidic in-
'dustrial pollutants combine with
rainwater to create rainfall that is
harmful to certain plants and
animals; and Love Canal is a New
York community suffering from a.
variety of health problems ap-
parently caused by toxic chemicals
which were buried in landfills in the
area.

Robinson Square

continued from page three-

issttcd by Mayor Erastus Cortting
ll. Five houses were knocked down.
HAP was fighting the courts to de—
tain l'urther dctnolilion.

By late summer of I975, the
Common Council approved a zon-
ing change to permit the develop-
ment of a mixed residential com-
mercial complex.

On August 26, 1977, ceremonies
were held launching the $8 to $l0
tnillion Robinson Square project.

"We fought them (the Gerritys)
without mercy for two years."
Mcritt claimed in a 1977 Knicker-
bocker News article. “From that
time on. we helped them. People
have held as responsible for what
we turned out.”

The Gerritys hired Tito Ander-
son. a well—noted Boston architect
of the Attdcrson~Notter Associav
tion. to design the entire project.
Two-thirds of the project was

finttttcctl by subsidies front the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The remaining third

Mayor Corning praised the pro-
Iject in a 1977 Knickerbocker News
l article by calling it “a giant step for-
5ward" in revitalization of the city.
