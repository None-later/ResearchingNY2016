Cadet defense manhandled
everything the Danes threw at them,
and shut Albany out. 13-0, in the
Vermont cold, rain. and mud.
Now Albanytwas in the midst of
what Ford called “a loaded
season,” and playoff-hopeful
Alfred was next. All-American can-
didate and Saxon quarterback Bob
Schuster had a field day throwing
short against the Danes. hitting 26
of 38 passes for 269 yards and a
touchdown. This. coupled with
another week of ineffective offense.

- resulted in a 24-6 Saxon victory.

50 the Danes were down again.
They had lost two. won four. and
dropped another pair. The incon-
sistency was rampant. After two
super-explosive offensive perfor-
mances that catapulcd Albany into
national statistical recognition. the
Danes had stalled. Motivation. in-
tensity —-— Albany needed a spark.
something to get them hot again ——
like a trip to Florida.

"As 21 learn.” Ford said in corn-
parison. “they (the 1980 team) had
rrol made a significant contribution
to the history of our program."
That would all change the following
week at the Tangerine Bowl in
Orlando.

PoiseI intensity, and potential all
came back into Albany‘s
vocabulary that Saturday night in
Florida. Despite falling behind by
two touchdowns twice, fullback

Chuck Priore and an lair-tight
defense spearheaded a second half
surge, and pulled the Danes to a
brilliant 28-27 victory over the
much larger Knights of Central
Florida. '

"The Central Florida game was
probably the highlight of our
year." Ford understated. “because
of the trip, what it did for the team
and the great ballgame we played.”

Summaries are only supposed to
come at the end of chapters and in
the beginning of soap operas — not
at the end of a football season. But
.that’s exactly what last Saturday's
finale against Springfield was like.

“At times. we've been one of the
best football teams we‘ve put on the
field here," Ford said, thinking of
their potential and Albany's spat-
tcred brilliance. He continued, with
his voice falling off a bit at the end.
“And at other times . . . "

The Chiefs went into the game
(needing a big win to solidify their
position as a Division II playoff
contender. Albany. in the ﬁrst
quarter. looked like those “one of
the best football teams" that Ford
spokc of. They blew Springﬁeld's
dcfcnsc open for 17 points in the
first 13 minutes. But then they stall-
ed. The Chiefs picked away with
two touchdowns in the second
quarter, and two more in the
fourth. while their defense shut
Albany down. and won, 28-17.

“The schedule was tough. l think
we played some very good football
teams," Ford said. “And i think we
rose to the occasion and played well
against some of thcnr. The whole

guess l'd have to say all five of them

indeed. there were a few that pro-
bably should've gone the other way.
Ford said that if he knew the causes
for the inconsistencies. and the pro—
blems. he'd have them solved. But
he has begun to narrow them down.

“We still cannot throw the foot~
ball well enough. consistently
enough. when teams are willing to
give us the pass." Ford stated. “l
think that's something we've got to
work on —- to throw the ball well
enough to compliment the running
attack that we've got. In order to be
a good football team, you've got to
be balanced."

Ford felt that. despite rising to
the challenge of playing Ithaca. and
wirtning in thc Tangerine Bowl. the
Dancs have lost some cstccm

around their circles.

“1 think next ycar." Ford said,
“our challenge. our goal. will be to
win back our respect."

NEW ORLEANS (AP) Good fighters learn by experience. So what
did Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard learn about one another in
Montreal that will help them in their rematch for the World Boxing
Council welterweight championship Tuesday night in the Superdomc?

Duran. who won the title on alclosc but unanimous decision June
20, is cagcy when asked.

"I learned a lot." said the Panamanian Wednesday. “1’” showlyou
at the ﬁght." .

As for what Leonard learned that might be useful in the rematch.
Duran said. "I don't think Ire can do anything more than he did in the
first ﬁght. if he does anything more, 1'” be ready for it."

“There have not been any drastic changes." Leonard said of battle
plans. “I just found out 1 have a left jab. I'll just pace myself more
carefully this time."

"The left hand will be in play this time." said Angelo Dundee. who
trnins Leonard. Dundee and Janks Morton, another Leonard aide. I
fch Leonard didn’t jab and move enough in the first fight and that he 
shouldn't have tried to ﬁght it out in the early rounds when Duran
gained his winning edge. 1

"We're going toi‘rght him, but this time later on when Ray has i
taken the steam out of Durnn." said Dundee. !

Freddy Brown. who helps train Duran, doesn't think it matters what |
strategy Leonard employs. “Duran will ﬁght the other guy's fight."
said Brown. “When Duran walks Into the ring, he's the boss."

Ray Arcel, another of Durun's strategists, feels the ﬁrst ﬁght might
have left a scar on Leonard. “1t affected Leonard mentally." said
Arcel. “It took all the guts out of him. it's a boy in against a man."

“The 15 rorrnds with’ Duran is all he needed." said Dundee. "He
knows Duran now. He's seen Duran. Duran doesn't punch a lot . . .

everything in there." r ' 7 ' \ ‘
