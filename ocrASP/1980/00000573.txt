V ‘Winning NucleusReturns For Men Swimmers

by Jeff Sehadoff

The'Aibany State men's swim'm-
ing' team. coming off last year's
rather impressivr “4 luaI m'eet
season and an .ttt 4th place
finish at the SUNXAC's are ready
and Albany coach Ron White feels
‘that the “nucleus is here my? this
season." ‘-

The squad is returning this year
'minus two of last year's mainstays
- notably Frank Heter and Tom
Roberts. both unable to swim due
to ineligibility but they are back in
coaching roles. Consequently the
new nucleus is Kevin Ahern. Steve
Bonawitz. Joe Shore. and diver Bill
Derkasclt.

“Many of tire guys feel tltat this
year's teanr is stronger than last
year's. We'll ltave a somewhat slow
start but watch out for next
semester. when we'll be at our
peak." said assistant coach Hctcr.
“With the experience of some of
the returning swimmers. and some
good clutclt performances by the
newcomers it looks like we might be
able to be respectable competition
this year." said junior backstrokcr
Shore. Alrerrt added. “This is a new
season for me and I feel that with
the combination of experience.
depth and talented new swimmers
we can pull off some suprises."

All right. the Danes were 5-5;
that's .500 ball. Butthe only teams
that are concerned about being .500
are those that aren't usually too
good. the ones that spend most of
their time under .500. The Albany
State varsity football team certainly
does not fit into that category. The
last time Albany fell near or under
that was in I976 — the year before
they went to the national playoffs.

The Danes have some
“potentially good young
freshman.” according. to White.
Free-styler Frank Kozakiewicz from
Albany High “has real good
freestyle credentials who has the
ability to really develop into a quali-
ty 50-yard to 200-yard freestyler."
White said.

“It's been rough in the beginning
with my studies but the coach has
helped me a lot. l feel that I can
really help the team. I’ve set a goal
already for myself and that's to
break Altern's iOO-yard freestyle
record. It looks like we're going to
do real well this year." says
Kozakicwicz. ‘

Another freshman startdout is
Lcnny Shoob from Merrick. l..l.
“l-Ie is a breast strokcr by trade
with middle to distance swimming
capabilities. Lenny can swim
attywhcrc frotn a 50 to a 1650-yard
race. He's really going to bc a key
man on the team especially to sup-

White said.

“These two guys cart realistically

thusiasnt and a combination of that
and Joe's experience . . . Lenny is a
key man for I can literally ntovc him
to any event to fill possible holes."

satisficd with 5-5." he continued.
calling the season. "the ttps and
downs of 1980."

There are other similarities bet-
ween 1980 and 1976. when the
Danes went 4-5. That was the last
time that Albany lost their first two
ballgamcs — before this year. Coin-
cidentally. those losses were to the
same teams both times.

Albany by no means had it easy
to begin with. Graduation took
away an explosive quarterback. attd
a core of top-notch. expericrtced
defensive personnel. What tltcy
were left with was a senior at the
helm of the wishbone. who had all
the physical tools he needed to
make the offettsc g0. bttt lacked the
ever-important game time necessary
to perfect those skills. There was
still a capable crew manning the
Dane 4-4, brrt injuries dccintated

. that contingent rather early.

Besides their pcrsottnel situa-
tions. the Danes trad another thing
to think about rigltt away —- Ithaca
College.

Defending National Champs, top
rattkcd in the country. and Albany
had them first on tlte schedule.
Ford felt that there was probably no
good time to play the Bombers. and
he was probably right. The Danes
played what was their best losing ef-
fort. Thc final score was 40-21. but
Albany trailed by a mere six points
with 13 minutes left in the game.
Ithaca just pttlled away. though.
“We had enough opportunities."
Ford noted.

.The next week brought Southern

Albany could pttt together another
performance similar to the one

 

 

White said.

Junior transfer from Navy. Phil
Albright, “shows real good poten-
tial in early pro-season
workouts."said White. “We're
counting on Kozaklcwicz attd
Albright to help us in the free sprint
events." .

Another junior transfer from
Spring Valley is Neil Ullman
originally from East Carolina
University. Due to eligibility rules

breaststroke, along with the in-
dividual medley. His freestyle times
are quite outstanding for Division
III competition. He'll be right there
with Kevin Altern. His times are as
fast as Steve Bonawitz's in the
backstrokc,"White said. “This
could be a good push for Steve to
maintain his status as our number
one backstroker."

“Neil’s personal best in the lit-
dividual medley is 2:02.0, which is
well under Albany's

school v

record.” said White.

Bonawitz commented “Neil’s
presence. will' make me work just
that much more harder towards the
SUNYAC's. We’ve got some good-
looking young prospects with some
real solid potential. but it will de-
pend on how much we really want it

we’re going to have to work."

Dave Motola has really come in-
to his own this year. said White.

“I felt that we (the coaches) had
blown that ballgamc." Ford said itt
disgust. “Oh-and-two — that's pro-
bably not the best way to start
out."

It certainly wasn't. and if there
was a perfect tlrne for the schedule
to provide some mercy. it was at
this point, in week three.

The Danes traveled to Brockport
to face a Golden Eagle squad that
maybe wasn't up to par with
Albany's other 'compctitlon. but

 

( Questions Had To Be Answered, And Still Do ,

was’a team that Albany needed to
have. and needed to beat — which
they did with mechanical efficiency.

There were a lot of aspects of the
Albany game that had ttot yet come
to the fore. The Dattes had a
"stable" of great runningbacks, as
Ford put it. They had not yet
established themselves as a dorrti-
ttant force in a game. The special
learns. art area that Ford felt could
and should ttrrn games around.
wasn't yet a factor.

Against Brockport. the wisltbone
churned out 370 yards on the
ground. and ptrt 42 points on the
scoreboard (even with three
touchdowns being called back).
Albany defensive back Don Bowen
returned punts for art average of 27
yards per try. arid rat} one back for
a 53-yard touchdown. Sonte signs
were there. but a few were still miss-
ittg. artd they were the key ingre-
dicnts that most of the season lack-
ed ——- consistency . and intcttsity.

Witlt Fordham cante a glintpsc of
wlutt was necessary as far as intertsi-
ty goes. After leading 9-0. Albany
fell behind 14-9, with nine minutes
rcntainirtg in the game. The Danes
then marched 76 yards in 16 plays
for the score. nttd a 17—14 victory.
“I didn't think we could pull it
off." Ford suid afterwards.

The otltcr ltalf of those two
crucial components -— consistency
— was shown not to be evident
when Albttrty went to Buffalo to
play the tItert-nationally ranked
Bulls. This tinre. the Danes were
ahead by a 24-8 score at the Italf.
Albany was totally domitrutlng
play. rolling off 218 rushing yards
in the first two quarters to Buffalo‘s
56. "We looked as good as a foot-

   

ball tearu cart agaittst a strong
defense." Ford rtotcd about
Albany's first half itt that game.
But as becatnc more obvious as
the season progressed. the Danes
were unable to put together two
good halves of football. Mistakes
enabled the Bulls to get two
touchdowns in the second half. and
really give Albany a scare. Bttt the
Danes ltcld on to win. 27-24.
Homecoming brotrglrt Albany
some more easy pickings. A not-so-
good Cortland squad fell victim to a
hot Dane offense. After gaining 445
yards in total offense the week
before. Albany cranked up for an
incredible 572 yards total. and 552

Irish Prisoners Rement bored

 

8O Gather at Empire State Plaza .

by Wayne Peereboom

A crowd of approximately 80
gathered at the Empire State Plaza
on Saturday as part ofa nationwide
"Day‘of Solidarity" to show sup-
port for seven prisoners who are on
a hunger strike in Northern Ireland.

Albany's dcntottstration was
organized by the “Irish Coalition“
which is an informal organization
of six Irish groups in this area. ac-
cording to leader John Moore. Tltc
Albany demonstrators listened to
speccltes at the Plaza before mar-
ehirtg to the State Assembly. where
they heard speeches by supporting

 

   

Assemblymen. Later in that ses-
sion. Moore said. the Assembly
passed a resolution supporting the
hunger striking prisoners. Moore
said copies ofthat resolution will be
sent to Governor Hugh Carey. the
British I Consolate and to the
prisoners themselves.

Moore explained that the
prisoners began their hurtgcr strike
on October 26. demanding that they
be given “Political Prisoner
Status" by tile British. Moore said
they are currently classified as
crirttinals. even though they claim

   

that they are being held for
“political reasons." Speakers at the
Plaza noted that the prisoners
“prefer death rather’ than being
classified as criminals."

Speaker Jim Devine of Dublin,
Ireland said he felt “The British
have a terrible record of inhumanity
and serious mistreatment in Nor-
thern Irelattd. We want to err-
couragc the (U.S.) government to
speak out against it.”

They feel that Director of

He said Sasto did trot "follow tltc
standard procedure of checking
each room" as Doyle reported. He
said ltc saw smoke coming from
under the door of tire sttitc's otltcr
bedroom. and that Sasto “was
afraid to go in." He then opettcd
the door. saw a lot of smoke. did
ttot see artyonc in the room. and
left.

While Doyle claimed that the fire
was not electrical itr origin. Gutier-
rez. Perry. Mcditta and their fourth
striternatc Lionel Hamilton all feel
the fire was caused by a futtity elec-
trical socket.

Gutierrez said the socket was
“always shorting out" atrd that the
University said they ltad fixed it.
However. Assistant Director of
Public Safety Karl Scltarl tends to
ttgrcc tttorc with Doyle's story.

Arson investigation teams front

the Albany Fire Department, tltc
Guilderland Police Department,
attd officials front the Public Safety
Department were all on the sccnc
after tltc fire was extinguished. and
agreed the fire was ttot electrical.
“No marks were found on the elec-
trical wircs irt tlte roortt. attd tltc
face plate of the outlet was not
charred." said Scltarl. Scltarl added
that sotttc strbstartcc was fottttd on
tile floor and was sent to be analyz-
cd.

Doyle still stands by tnost of his
earlier facts. addittg that discrepan-
cieiarosc “titre to a misunderstan-
ding." Hc'claimed to be unaware of
tire students belief that the fire was
caused by art outlet and that the
studertts piantted to sue. He said ltc
would “look into these matters."

Doyle ttddcd that it is University’
policy that belongittgs irt a room are
the responsibility of the individual.
“The students would need to
demonstrate rtcgligertce on the part
of the University." Ire said.

Quad Coordinator Gayle Grif-

rcccivctl ltis facts. says she was “not
involved itr the fire itself." “I ques—
tioned tltc RA about the events
heading to the discovery of tire fire
and reported thcnt to I)oylc.“shc
said.

RA Snsto was unavailable for
comment.

Griffith frrrtlter wished to correct
