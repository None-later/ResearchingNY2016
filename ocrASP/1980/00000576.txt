be clectrocutcd. He has killed that

adds, something has to be done to
stop the spread of marijuana and
other drugs.

Researchers found that full-time
runners who averaged more than 70
miles a week were far more likely to
have marital problems than occu-
sional or moderate runners.

Nearly half the full-time rtumcrs
questioncred in the survey admitted
that their partners felt neglected. in
40 percent of the cases. the friction
from running was serious enough to
lead to a break-up.
