John Dieckelman ls back where
he feels he belongs. After graduating
from Albany's Christian Brothers
Academy In 1978. Dieckelman
packed up and went off to Colgate.
A year later he was home in Albany,
watching the Albany State basketball
team. This season. he'll be starting at
center for the Great Danes, and he'll
be enjoying it.
You see. playing basketball in
Albany was all Dieckelman ever
wanted to do. --
“l don't think of myself as playing
only for Albany State." Dieckelman
said. “i feel that l'm playing for
Albany, i like where i live."
And why shouldn't he? As a stan-
dout basketball player for CBA in
1977 and 1978, Dieckelman
became a local celebrity of sorts. in
his senior year. he learned with
Sierra guard Kevin McGraw to' lead
CBA to an 18-2 record and recogni-
tion as the top team in the area. But
coupled with all the on-court hoopla
was another equally pleasing situa-
tion for Dieckelman: he was home.
“l have a good family life." he said.
Still. Dieckelman decided to
leave. After being heavily recruited
by a number of schools (including
Albany State). he chose Colgate. “l
listened to everyone else."
Dieckelman recalls. “Everyone told
me I should get away from home,
and I liked Colgate when i saw it."
What Dieckelman entered was an
atypical basketball program. A Divi-
sion Isclrool. Colgate maintained an
intriguing schedule which comprised
a Division lll remnant like lthaca
alongside major college powers
Clemson. Syracuse, and LSU. Star-
ting often as a freshman. the 6-5

averaging 5.4 points a game on 55
percent shooting, as the Red Raiders
came away with a 12-14 record.
“i think I improved as a player that
year." Dieckelman said. “it was a
great learning experience. l learned
'tow to be tough on court. and that
you can't let anyone take advantage '
of you."
Despite his successful transition on t
the court. though. certain tremors
became increasingly disturbing for
Dieckelman. He admits being
"sensitive" about the reasons sur-

But now. with Cesare moved to

to have a profound effect on his

The Danes got a big break last
year, when John Dieckelman decid-

in his home town of Albany.
Because after sitting out a year

is the newest addition to the Albany
lineup — and he certainly couldn't

Dieckelman gives the Danes an add-

listing Dieckelman's positive aspects.
“When he gets the ball Inside."
Cesare said, "he knows what to do
with it."

But he does have his shortcom-
ings. “He's just got to prove a lot
defensively, and he's got to play with
greater intensity." Sauers noted.
“And he's got to rebound for us."

“He's got to get fired up. because
a guy that's fired up against him at
times. is going to make him look
bad. just because he's fired up."
Sauers continued.

Player award — a tribute to the
Danes' great depth a year ago. The
numbers aren't as high this season.

schoolwise. and I met a lot of peo-

frustrating. because l know I could

However. this year's Danes arc
Dicckelman's team. He will start at
one of the two post positions in
Sauers‘ offensive setup, where his
shooting, rebounding, and passing
will all be needed.

 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 

but the personnel that is there is
quality material.

First man off that bench many
times will be sophomore swingman
Mike Gatto. As a freshman on last
year's J .V., Gatto was the team's se-
cond leading scorer, and showed the
ability to play either the guard or for-
ward spot well. A capable
ballhandler. the 62 Gatto can also

. provide the tough interior defense

that Sauers demands.

"l think the trip (to Sweden over
the summer) was probably more
profitable for him than for anybody."
Sauers said, "because he gained the
confidence, before the Season ever
started. that he could play."

Joining Gatto as one of the early I

members off the bench will be senior
Steve Low. A defensive specialist.
the 6-4 Low also has the uncanny
ability to get open underneath for
easy baskets. “There's no doubt
about it — he does a lot of things for
us well." Sauers said, “particularly

6 Court Advantage

"He's very unselfish. and he has
good moves with his back to the
basket," Sauers said. “He's a good
passer. and sometimes he actually
looks to pass too much, But he lacks
intensity sometimes. and he has a
long way to go defensively. But
John's much more advanced than
the averagcI sophomore. and even-
tually I think he'll be the man we
look to in the middle."

Dieckelman brings an interesting
array of talents to the Danes. His
shooting arsenal consists of an ac»
curate jumper from 15 feet and in, a
steady batik shot from the sides. and
a lefty hook shot. And with his long
legs and dangling arms. Dieckelman
rebounds well. and when he doesn't

well as bélng one of Albany's best
foul shooters.

“Against a tall team, he'll make a
good matchup for someone out-

slower than the other perimeter
players. but he gives us pretty much
muscle inside."

“if these guys want to rebound."
Sauers said, "i think they can be one
of the best rebounding teams l've
ever had — if they want to go after
the ball."

Rounding out the roster is guard
Glenn Phillips and postman Wilson
Thomas. Phillips. another
sophomore up from J.V.. possesses
a good jump shot and can put the
ball in from way out. "Glenn ls get»

ing a good adjustment. As long as he
doesn't try to do too much —- just
make the basic plays and get the of-
fense started, we'll do all right."

Thomas Is a 6-3 freshman. who
was brought to the varsity to shore
up the depth problem. “Eventually,
he's going to make a real line post
player. My only problem is that l
don't know how much experience
I'm going to be able to get him. and
playing time in the games right
now," Sauers said. “because there's
so many people ahead of him. He
needs to play all the time."

it will be important for the Danes
to be able to keep their top players in
the games. Any foul trouble or in-
juries to key players for an extended
period of time could have drastic ef-
fects on the outcome of the season.

“it‘s just that we don't have the
numbers," Dieckelman said. “We
can't afford any injuries. and that's
tough."

Another thing that's tough is the
schedule. which Sauers Calls the
“toughest one I've ever had." It
