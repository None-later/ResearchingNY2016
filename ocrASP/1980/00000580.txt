coating and can survive 5 days in a

inhuch from droplcls or dust, iill'C-
ly by ingestion through conlttmirIu-
lieu of" food or ulcnsils.

Confusion uriscs oftcrt from the
fact that an individqu cart have a

'actual disease process. A positch

Icst simply means that thc irr-
dividuul has somehow. sorncwhcrc
conic itt contact with the organism
to sufficient-degree to cruise the
body to react to the test. Fifty ycars
ago virtually everybody would have
had it positive test by the urge of 20.
Now lower than 20 pcrccnt of
young people have n positch skin
test, an x—ruy of tire chest is in-
dicated however, and certain
groups such as workers in the health
field, for example, nccd especially
careful surveillance.

immunizing against tuberculosis
has been tried and used fairly cxtcn-
sivcly in other countries, but it is
not entirely satisfactory. Willi the
control of the disease in the US.
through cxccllcnt cusc finding,
meticulous follow-up on contacts,
and effective treatment in those
cuscs discovered such immunization
programs ttr‘c not practical.

In sumrrrury.’ infants and Drug-
nunl females are most susccptihlc to
the disease. Normally ItctIItIIy pco-
plc have considerable natural
resistance (not immurtity) to the
disease. It is most common in the
U.S.A. now in rcfugccs or in-
dividuals entering from countries
outside of the U.S.A. mainland or
in homeless. dcrclict alcoholics. The
important thing to realize is that
anybody can develop the disease
and It is medically prudent to main-
Iuin it high inch of suspicion and
constant scorch for tuberculosis
because it is now treatable rind
curable when picked up early
enough.
