Albany Swimmers Take Fifth In Dane Relays. ‘

 

by Jeff Schadofi’

Last Saturday the Albany State
men's swim tcant played host for
thc ilth Annual Grcat Dunc Swim-
ming and Diving Relays. The Danes
placcd fifth in a field of ttinc in the
four-year college division. Coast
Guard (i29 points) won the event as
titcy did last year with a decisive vic-
tory over RP! and Vermont, who
tied for second (108 points.) in
fourtlt was New Paltz with too,
followed by Albany with 90. McGiii
66, St. Michaels and Union tied at
42 and Vassar had 30.

in the two~ycar College Division,
Alfred chh just got by Monroc by
four points, 5l-47. Morrisviiic plac-
ed titird with 30. Orange Communi-
ty College and Cobblcskili tied for
fourth with 23 and Nassau rounded
out the ﬁeld with )9 points.

The first event was the 400-yard
frccstyic relay. This race. tltc first
win of the afternoon for the Coast
Guard, was one of six on tltc day
for them. They beat out RPI by two
seconds, in 3125.2, as a Dime relay
team of Kevin Altcrn, Stcvc
Bonawitz, Phil Albrlgitt and Lenny
Shoob placed fifth, in 33:34.2.

Next up was tltc 300-yard
brcaststrokc relay with Joe Shore,
Eric Fricdiand and Shoob rcprcscn-
tittg tltc home team. Titc Danes did
ttot fare as well in this relay, and
came iii a disappointing sixth with a
time of 3:27.0. a good distance
behind ﬁrst-place Coast Guard who

coasted lit at it rccord-btcuking titnc
of 3:i l.57.

Possibly thc bcst Dunc effort on
the day was turttcd lit by Aitcrn,
Bottttwitz. und Sltorc in thc
300‘yard bullcrfiy rcltty, placing a
strong fourth in 2153.6. Coast
Guard won their third consecutive
race, and uttrtincd Iitcir sccond mcct
record with a 22:48.2 litttc.

“Although we were satisfictl with
the effort, i fch \vc could itavc
done bcttcr. l swam in the second
relay and Kcvitt and Steve wcrc in
tltc first cvcnt. This race didn't give
us much time to catch our brctttit,“
said Shore.

A JOO-yard backstroke rcltty tcttnt
for the Dattcs of Jim (‘olgott. iioh
Lento, and Ed Picrcc pittccd fifth
behind RPi this titnc as litc
Enginccrs ctigcd ottt tltc (‘ortst
Guard for high honors, 2255.3 to
2:57.3 witlt titc Duncs pulling in at
3:14.7.

“.iint Colgttn was rcttlly litt-
prcssivc in his split with a l:0l,"
commcntcd Sltorc. ill this cvcnt

record as titcy won tltc two-ycat
Coilcgc Division rttcc ill 2155.3, to
bcat Rl’l's i979 rccord by Iiircc»
tenths of a second.

Thc Coast Guard cruiscd to
another easy victory iii the BOO-yard
t'rccslylc relay in 7:352 for yct onc
tnorc tttcct record brcuking titcir
own i979 mark of 7236.0. Albany
was totally out-matched itt this

A, Coast Guard Victorious Again

event. as Dave Motoltt, Frank
Korakicwicz. John Docrncr and
Alan Rcbhun clocked in at a distant
sixth with 8:413.

“i suppose we could have done
better. Tltc ntcct for tttc as well as
most of the team was basically to
sec how much work wc cart really
use. it was a learning experience for
me," said Kozakicwicz.

The sixth event of the scheduled
ttittc was the onc-ntctcr diving rciay
witct‘c each school had two divers
rcprcscnlcd. Vcrtttottt cdgcd out
RPl by just under eight points;
l94.35 to 186.80. The Danes had
their highest finish in ntty ottc cvcnt
as titcy took a third here with Ran-
dy Link and Bill Dcnluscit sharing
lllL‘ honors. Tltc two cotttbincd for
137.95 points.

"The season is curly but the
potcntiul is dcninitciy Itcrc. Titcrc is
no doubt we could have done bct-
tcr. Randy threw some new divcs
and he tried his bcst," said
Dcrkascli.

“i thought tltc tncct was good for
tile guys in tcrms'of cxposurc and
competition. For liiii, things arc
moving forward. it’s kind of early
to expect arty amazing pcrfor~
tnttnccs yet. For us, experience is a
big factor and you can icttrn rt lot
front a mcct like this — look, listen
and learn. For us it was a good
start. i'nt looking forward to tltc
rest of tltc scason," said Albany
diving couch Brucc Sicklcs.

Following the diving was the
600-yard individual ntcdicy relay
with John Docrncr, Ed Pierce and
Bob Lento participating for thc
Dancs. Their 7222.5 was again a dis-
tant scvcnth as the Coast guard was
dccisivciy beaten by first-piacc
McGili, 6217.7 to 6:24. Tltc McGill
rclay tcam crusitcd Coast Guard's
l979 rccord in thc cvcnt by nearly
eight seconds.

The 200 yard ‘frccstyic rcluy
found nottc otitcr titan Coast Guard
winning this racc as titcy bcat out a

Paitz. by just under four seconds
and brcaking titcir own 1975
record. Kozakicwicl. Coigan,
Motola, and chf Farkus lurttcd in a
fourth place finish in what might
have been lhc bcsl race of the day.
“Everybody swam a real good
early season split time. i was happy
with my effort. i never swam the
50-yard frccstylc and l was pretty
plcascd wilit the results," said Coi-
gan.
Titc Danes went out with a

the last event of the day. At this
point Albany was i2 points out of
New Paltz's fourth place and it
scented evident that the Dancw were
unable to get fourth place. But
Bonawitz. Shore, Ahcrn, and
Aibright finished a respectable
fourth in 1138.0. RPl placed third
in l:35.9, New Paltz was second in

rccord with a l:3l.8'.

“Tltc tncdlcy was undoubtedly

our_bcst racc. We got a super effort
from Phil (Albright), the freestyle
lcg. Considering it was a last mittutc
dccision for Phil to swim this race,
he did a real good job," said
Altern.
“l was really pttt on the spot. On
the day l was pretty consistent with
my times for early season but my
timcs will get rttucit better," said
Aibrigitt.

“Today‘s cffort shows that we
ltavc some work to do. We have
definitely improved over last year
but we need sortie work. Without a
doubt the young guys will help a
grcat deal," said Altcrn in his
analysis of the tncct.

Assistant couch Frank Heter
said. "wc didn't do too bad. The
competition was tnuclt more intense
this year. There were a lot of good
times for this early in the season
and we show a lot of strong potcn-

‘tiai. Joe Sltorc's early season ﬂat

start tintc»in the brcaststrokc relay
was sttpcrb. When Ncai Uliman
comes back next semester his dual
tnccl strength will give the team
more depth and an excellent l-2
punch."

The next meet for the Danes is
December 3 as they travel to

,Oswcgo for their first dual meet of

the young season.
