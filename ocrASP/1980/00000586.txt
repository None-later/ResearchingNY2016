‘Tis the Season to GetMono

 

Those Symptoms May Need Some Checking Into

by Dr. Janet Hood

Infectious mononucleosis is a
disease especially common among
young adults, ranking third as a
cause for admission to SUNYA's

;. _H€FlLTH NEW?

The usual symptoms include
fcver. general discomfort. fatigue,
sore tllroat. and enlarged glands.
especially in the neck. It is not
possible to make a definitive
diagnosis unless there are certain
changes in the white blood cells and
blood serum. Many cases are so
mild as to be undetectable except by
these tests. A few patients are sick
enough to spend several weeks in
bed. Every intermediate degree of
severity may be found. The disease
is usually discovered after the pa-
tient has been sick a week or two.

Cause and Transmission:
Mononucleosis is now felt to be
caused b y the 13-1! virus and passed
from person to person much as
chicken pox. The interval between
infection and the appearance of the
first symptoms of disease is pro-
bably about 11 days. This period.
during which the patient usually
feels perfectly chI, is when the pa-
tient is most likely to transmit the
disease to anyone else. By tltc tintc
symptoms appear, the paticnt is not
infectious to others.

Usual Course: Many pct-sons do
not feel at all ill with
mononucleosis. Athlctcs have occa-
sionally been found participating in
vigorous contact sports during the
height of an attack. (This is NOT
rccotnmendcd.) Many other per-
sons fecl moderately ill but don’t
consult a doctor. Those who do
may give a story of gradually in-

 

 

throat. general
discomfort. fatigue, mild fever.
headache and loss of appetite
Often they complain ofan obstinate
sore throat which has persisted
longer than previous ones they have
had. Small bumps. swollen lymph
nodes, appear especially in the back
of the neck. The illncs' lasts from a
few days to several wecks and the
nodes may last for a month or
more. A few individuals are very
wuak and sick for many weeks. and
a very few (far fewer than with
measles or mumps) die of complica-
tions. Almost all patients recover
completely with no after effects.

Sore Throal: This is a frequent
symptom of mononucleosis. and
drinking hot liquids is about as cf-
fcctive a way to treat it as any. In
some cases. however. infection with
streptococci or other pathogenic
bacteria may complicate the situa-
tion and then antibiotics may speed
recovery. Otherwise antibiotics
such as penicillin don‘t help this
disease.

Rush: In many cases a rash ap-
pears. It is usually faint. short-
lasting, and confincd to the trunk
area rcscmbling German Measles.

Sudden Severe Abdominal Pain:
In most cascs of mononucleosis the
spleen (alt organ in the left upper
part of the abdomen) is swollen.
Occasionally it ruptures spon-
taneously or as the result of
pressure to the abdomen. Rupturc
of the spleen is fortunately very rare
in mononucleosis (we have never
seen such a case). but if it does oc-
cur, it is ilnpcrativc that the patient
and his friends realize that a
catastrophe is impending and seek
surgical care immediately. The few
deaths that have occurred with
mononucleosis have usually bccn

creasing sore

due to rupture of the spleen. The
most dangerous period seems to be
about two weeks after the onset of
the discasc's symptoms. Severe ab-
dominal pain is the red flag warn-
ing.

Blood & Liver Tests: Any
diagnosis of mononucleosis is con-
sidered doubtful until confirmed by
one or more blood tests. The blood
count usually shows a large number
of atypical white blood cells. The
blood serum shows characteristic
inununological changes. and the pa»
tient may hear that his “monospot
is positive." This test is not always
positive in the early stage of the
disease and tnay need to be repeated
before a positive diagnosis cart bc
made. The monospot may. on the
other hand, remain positive for
many weeks after the patient has
recovered. The degree of positivity
of tile blood tests docs ltot
necessarily correlate with the severi-
ty of the disease.

Tests for liver function oftcn
show that tile liver is luorc or less

inflamed. and often correlate
roughly with thc patient's sense of
fatigue. This type of hepatitis is not
to be cottfuscd with other types of
primary hepatitis, and is mild and
self-limited. It should not be alarm-
ing but does call for restriction of
fats and alcohol while tests are ab-
normal.

Physical Activity: Most of the
organs are somewhat impaired dur-
ing an attack of mononucleosis,
and it is wise to avoid strenuous ac-
tivity of all types while the disease is
active. Contact sports and otltcr ac-

 

therc were no injuries.”

 

Volks Collides with Bus
Near Plant Department

Early last Monday a SIINYA bus crashed into the back of a yellow
Volkswagon on l’critttctcr Road near the Physical Plant Department
building. Public Safety records show.

Thc incident occurrctl when the Volkswngon braked suddenly to
avoid crashing into a car exiting the Dttlcb Quad parking lot.

Onc bus pusscngct‘, sophomore Dean Bctz, reported that “the
enginc part of the \’.\V. was crushed. The driver was shaken up but

Tllc SUNYA bus, however, was not damaged in the crash anti no
stuntttonscs were issued, according to Public Safety records.

tivitics which might cause rupture
of the spleen are especially to be
avoided. In a few cases strenuous
exercise has seemed to cause the
disease to ﬂare up again after seem-
ing recovery. It is not. however,
necessary to wait for the blood tests
to become entirely normal before
resuming moderate activity.

Diet: No special diet is needed.
However, during a disease in which
the liver is more or less impaired, it
is wise to avoid greasy indigestlblc
foods and alcoholic beverages.

Medications: Antibiotics, gamma
globulin. steroids, and various
drugs have sometimes been used in
the treatment of mononucleosis.
httt they have been demonstrated to
be of no value except for certain
complications.

Immunity: An attack of
mononucleosis. like an attack of
measles. usually confers lifelong im-
munity. The disease is rare over the
age of 25 because by that time most
individuals have already had
mononucleosis, either symptomatic
or inappurcnt. Where two or more
attacks are claimed by the same pa-
tient, a careful history usually
shows at least one of the diagnoses
to have been inadequately confirm-
cd by lab tests.

 

by Mark Flschcttl

They speak of the trauma. of the
terrifying experience of being
separated from their children. They
speak of the helplessness in trying
to get them back, in trying to gain
custody of them. They speak at
Equal Rights for Fathers.

4 News FEATURE

W

Equal Rights for Fathers (ERFF)
of New York State started four
years ago by a group of hurt fathers
trying to gain cqunl child custody
rights.

"As fathers we find ourselves
on the short cud of the joint
custody system," Wcs Moore. vice
president of the Capital District
IERFF chapter, said. “We are
lighting 50 years of discrimina-
tion."

ERFF's present concern is joint
custody rights.

“We believe in equal father’s
rights and equal father's respon‘
sibilities. The children rtecd to have
both’parcnts in their life." Moorc
explained.

Of the 14 people who attended
the chapter's recent monthly
meeting at the Colonic Town
Library, some spoke with anger of
their divorced partners, others
spoke with understanding. Some
who attended were regulars, while
ethers came searching for help.

 

However. all shared an overriding
concern for their children.

“l’ttrtncrs should not be fighting
over their kids as a substitute to
working ottt tllcir problems,"
Moore said.

lERlil7 frequently has guest
speakers at their mcctings, and
Albany attorney Edward Haddcd
was there to educate those present
on the Equitable Property Distribu-
tion Law. ERFF is concerned with
all aspects of marital problems. and
is not just a pro-father organiza-
tion.

“There may be ltopc to reconcile
a marriage. Then you don’t nccd
Iawycrs, you need counselors,"
Moorc said.

ERFF works with ERA groups, a
local divorced men's group called
“Manifest,” and other groups in
trying to ltclp married partners.

“It's an educational effort."
Moore said. “We are in touch with
lawyers, counselors, and
legislatures. We learn from and
teach each other. Our ntain pro«
blem is getting word arouan that
piece have a place to turn to.”

“Next to your attorney. ERFF is
your best defense." he says.

What ERFF is fighting is sexism
in the courts.

"We want equal rights for
fathers. mothers, and children,"
Moore said in a brief address during
the meeting. Another member.
Boaz Avitzur. responded, “We
must stop using the children as a

weapon for extracting money from
the other party (during divorce pro-
cccdings)."

Avitiur pill his and other llclplcss
fathcrs‘ (lilcmmus in historical cort-
text after the meeting.

“Very fcw fathers cvcr gain
custody over the challenge of thc
mothct. You can't force a father
out of his duties if he is willing to do
them." he insists.

“This is thc result of a prejudice
which has cvolvcd through several
decades." Avitzur explained. “In
the agricultural society, the father
got custody. As the industrial socie-
ty evolved he was forced otlt of the
home and he lost his parental duty.
Now. with our modern mobile
society, we are back to ground 1.cro,
but thc judch still havc the moral
values of ycars past." he said.

ERFF hopes to change that. They
have introduced two trial bills dur-
ing the past two sessions of the
State legislature. The response was
positive, Moore said. ERFF is now
lobbying for the ﬁlial, rcviscd ver-
sion. the Barclay-Lasher bill. which
has been prcfilled for January first,
1981. Based on past response.
Moore said he expects it will pass.

Under the bill, “The court would
have to award Joint custody. even if
only one parent wanted it. unless
the court could prove that It would
not be good for the children,"
Moore explained. "Now the burden
of proof is on the court. They have

r ‘7
Dads Turn the Tables Demanding Equal Rights

taken the easy way out — to award
custody to the mother. We want to
give them a new easy way out ~—
joint custody."

The Capital District Chapter of
ERFF was formed last January by
Moore and a current member of the
group who said ltc wishes to remain
anonymous for legal reasons.

“I became separated in
May I979. and took most of the
care of my child for eight months."
hc said. “In February. l980, my
daughter's mother went to the
courts to get an order of custody.
She didn't have to produce the or
tile child. I received a statement that
I had lost custody, and had to
counter-sue just to see my
daughter," he said.

After a hearing. a
schedule was set up.

“She had temporary Custody for
six lnonths, but I had trouble with
visitation. I had to sue again in the
and of September, based on the
denial of the visitation. Visitation
rights are so weak one must con-
stantly go back to the courts," he
said.

He met the New York State
ERFF people while testifying before
a State Assembly hearing on joint
custody. He met Moore, and they
organized the local chapter.

Now the group is growing. There
are six chapters statewide, and four
more underway.

visitation

“I get many calls from people," '
Moore said. "They say, ‘My wife '

wants out. Should i get a lawyer? I
don't know what to do.’ "

One such caller was Rector McIn-
tyrc.

"My wife was walking out on
me." he stud. “l cattle home one
day and she was gone. I said, ‘If
you want to go, go, but you can't
take the kids.’ "

Mcllttyrc had ltcard about ERFF on
the radio.

“Now we’re legally separated,"
he said. “If it weren't for the
organiintion, I wouldn’t have
known about joint custody."

McIntyre said he would have had
to give up his kids. since the molller
almost always gets custody under
normal court procedures.

“They scent to like going back
and forth." McIntyre said of his
threc childrctt. ages six. three, and
18 months.

“From watching my own kids.
joint custody is the best thing for
them." he said.

The members of ERFF agree,
and feel that joint custody is the
best solution for the parents as well.

"No parent should have to
undergo the terror of separation
from their child,” one father. "It's
a terrifying threat. Often the parent
will give up the child rather than
ﬁght and expose himself to the ter-
ror.

“ERFF's promotion of joint
custody is the one way we can over-
come that terror," he explalncdj
