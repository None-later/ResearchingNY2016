Learning to Shop Before You Schuss

by Mark “added

If you’re thinking of skiing at
least 10 times this season. it might
be wiser to buy skis than rent them.
Ski-shopping. however. is no easy
matter for tire beginner. For one
thing. there are different types of
skis depending on what type of ter-
rain you'll be skiing on. Downhill
skis are longer and stiffer than
mogul skis. which are short and

ntorc ﬂexible for guick turning.

A full ski package includes skis.
poles. boots. and bindings. The skis
themselves can run artywhere front

$60 to $350. Poles. probably the
cheapest expenditure. can be
bought for around $12 to $40. Bin—
dings go for as little as $30 to as
much as $120 and up. Boots start at
around $50 and can cost up to $300.

What makes a piece of ski equip-
tncnt expensive? Good skis are
usually not made of one or two
solid layers. The better skis are con-
structed with multiple layers of
ﬁberglass and metal. It‘ you are a
beginner. it would be best not to
start with a $300 racing ski. It takes
much practice to learn ltow to use a
really good ski correctly. and
therefore the more moderately pric-
ed recreation skis (about 5105) are

I

probably the best bet. Most of the
top manufacturers like Rossignol.
Head, Krl. and Olin make good
recreational skis for the novice.

Ski poles should be the least ex-
pensive piece of equipment because
there is little difference in pole
quality. However. many skiers ﬁnd
that certain grips are better than
others. The cheaper poles are equip-
ped with a strap attached to a finger
grip. With such a pole. failing the
wrong way may cause some injury
to the thurttb if it is caught in tltc
strap. The more expensive poles
feature strapless handles that are
contoured to the grooves of your
ltands. The handle is ﬂexible and
contains a break so that the thumb
and hand cart easily be released. A
good pair of poles with a modern
grip cart usually be found for under
$20. The top pole manufacturers
are Kcrmas. Scott. and Tontic.

I Bindings are the link between the
skis and the boots. in essence, they
have nothing to do with ski perfor-
mance. if they are mounted secure-
ly. The main purpose of the binding
is to release the ski from the boot
during a had full to prevent injury.
A more expensive bindittg may be
more reliable, since it releases only
when you have a had full and does
not release during average impact.
Another feature which doesn't af-
fect price is the type of release. The
ISO release is sensitive to toe and
heel impact while the 360 release
can react to almost any impact. A
furtltcr consideration is a brake at-
tachment. which keeps the ski from
sliding after release witltout the use
of cables. This accessory costs
about $I0 to $15. Ski brakes are

basically obsolete in the East. where

cables are a requirement on the
slopes. Therefore, one should only

consider purchasing a ski brake if
they are planning to ski out West)

Boots are an extremely important
aspect of the ski package, since thcy
keep the feet warm. dry. and stable
while giving support to the ankle.
Boots are constantly being improv-
cd and the better ones feature foam
and air padding that can be pumped
up or deﬂated to fit your leg snugg-
ly. In many cases styling hikes the
price. but it‘s rtot unreasonable to
spend $75 to $100 for boots. Some
of the most popular manufacturers
are Nordiqua. Dolomite. Hanson
and Raichle.

No one ever said that skiing is
cheap. btrt tItcrc are ways for the
beginner to cut dowrt on costs.
Sometimes one can get some very
good used ski equipment. Many
stores also offer ski packages at dis-
count prtccs. Herman's World of
Sporting Goods on Wolf Rpad
featured Rossignol Stratex skis.
Tyrolia super or Sttlontan S bin-
dings. artd poles for $l35. Other
stores in the Albany area like The
Ski Market (600 Troy Schenectady
Road. l.atham) and Trail North
(895 and 897 New London Road.,
Latitum) and The Phoenix Ski Shop
(1038 Troy Schenectady Road.
Latham) are all good ski stores that
cart probably pttt together an attrac-
tive package for you. The key is to
shop around and pay attention to
construction rather than styling.
Rcrncrrthcr no matter ltow stylish
your equipment is, if it isn't suited
to your ability. you probably won't
be looking too good.

chased the man up Lake Avenue
and dowrt Washington Avenue.

Vislocky said that while she was
chasittg the attacker she called two
men walking along North Lake
Avenue asking for help. Neither of
the men responded.

When police arrived. Vislocky
said. Demet directed them towards
Washington and West Streets.
Police circled the area until they ar-
rested Thomson in an alley near
Robins Street.

When asked whether she was
frightened about ﬁghting off her at-
tacker. Vislocky responded, “I was
originally. but i knew there was no
way in hell i was going into the park
with him."
