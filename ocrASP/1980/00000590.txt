I'm alive and well and living In the
213i century. 2080 to be exact. I'm a
student or perhaps I should say “was a
student." You see. I'm now confined to
a state hospital. Society feared for my
sanity or so they maintained. A mad-
man without a cause. If you will. The
state has consented to allow me to
speak to you. They have nothing to
fear, for you have all been dead for
years. In the days before my confine
ment, a typical day included people be.
lng killed because Somebody didn't
like their politics. l was "lucky." I
guess.

We are born Into a world that has
spelled out with brutal clarity that we
are worthless. For why else would we
be expected not to aspire to ex-
cellence? instead, we are expected to
make peace with mediocrity. We are In

but as we have discovered, people find
It very difficult to act on what ls known.
To act Is to be committed (forgive my
pun) and being committed Is to be In

No, my friend, we are not hereto see
or feel, only to live through the pain
and/or the joy, as It may appear. Illu-
sions paint themselves upon our minds
and our souls. leaving the stains of
naivete behind. Emotions serve as "trip
wires" for hidden clues to a puzzle call-
ed life. Robots In our minds patrol over
our “creativity” to Insure the success
of our failings. Windows In the attic of
time open themselves to move human
societies locked Into despair oi now.

Children talk to their parents of peace

responsibility to the State. Insects of
the world, stand ready to rule Planet
Earth, so that humans can go back to
caves. Life has become a mist of
death, sprinkled over the fields of time.

I‘m a visible man. I guess. You know.
the one everybody sees but no one
talks to. That strange creature who In.
habits space and time, somewhere in a
modern day limbo. And I'm hungry.
Yes. I‘m hungry for love. love I'll never
see. Love that each of us, when we
stop playing the roles long enough,
must recognize we need. Sterile human
forms move across the screen, placing
excess imagery In my back pocket.
Once before I die. I‘d liked to have
known whether It ls possible to love a
human being without always having to
accept bullshit for slncerlty‘s rightful
place, In our lives.

Greetings Comrade: - ‘
I received your correspondence and
am glad to hear things are working out
so well In your latest Government Pro-
ject. Praises to our wonderful leader
for he has truly brought us bounty.
Even as l write, the hogs grow latter
and the wheat springs from the earth. It
Is a good life we lead here In Namerlc.
My domestic unit ls getting along
lucratively. Our cooperative has ex-
panded three-fold since last we com-
municated, and one of the wives,
Shelba the Younger, Is pregnant with a
son. Praises to our brilliant techno-
surgeons without whom such a bless-
Ing would be Impossible. I hope your
dom-unlt Is eouallv prosperous.
Comrade, It has been many
months since we were last to-
gether. I still remember your face and
your hands as we tolled side by side on
the Work Farm. I know It Is not permit-

 

 

ted, but when I lie In bed at night.
before the synchrosleep pill has taken
effect, I try to concentrate on your Im-
age. It causes great pain, but when I
succeed, a flood of warmth rushes
through my body. It Is difficult to
describe, comrade, but when your Im-
age becomes clear, like a holograph.
my sight ls clouded by moisture and
swallowing becomes difficult and pain-
ful; I have read about this condition In
ancient physiological Journals. I know
this Is dangerous to write about but
these electromagnetic Impulses are of
such high amplitude that I feel com-
pelled to tell you and to ask If you have
had similar experiences.

I know I risk a great deal In doing
this. I am not even sure that i unders-
tand my motivation. After all, six years
on the Work Farm tannht me a lesson

 

In discipline. I believe our leader Is
benevolent and that the regulations
are for our own good. And I certainly
understand why we must not act In un-
iavorable ways. I realize such behavior
only creates problems that‘cannot be
resolved. I have learned well the
lessons of poll-history and understand
how the race suffered under Deregula-
tlon. I would not wish those "emotional
ailments" of yore on anyone. least of
all my venerable comrade.

But lately something Inside me has
not been right. I have not been able to
pinpoint the source of this distur-
bance, much less analyze Its dynamics
but I have calculated the factors and
have deduced that you are necessarily
an element In this situation. Let the
elaborate.

During the last astrocycle my dom.
unit was called up for Gov. Exp. duty.
which required we stay at the Skinner
Observatory for four days. In the confu-
sion of readjustment, I forgot my syn-
chrosleep pills. Since we were away
from the co-op we were on self-reg and
no one noticed that I neither took the
pills nor hooked Into the Modulating
Reg at night. Comrade, I cannot ex-
plain to you the experiences I had.
Each time when darkness came and
the others were hooked Into the Mod, I
lay there, not awake, yet not In syn-
chrosleep. Then these stories came In-
to my brain like archaic theatre
representations. You were there. Com-
rade, and it was as though we were
together again. But everything was
distorted. People faded and changed
and their actions were not linear or se-
quential. Thought and reason were not
orderly chains of causal deducable
relationships; they were disjointed and
the events In my brain were accom-
panied by physiological reactions such
as rapid occular movements, Irregular
EEG patterns and that same Intense
warmness that I described earlier.
Then came the strangest thing of all: I
was no longer bound by gravity or Iner-
llu; I floated freely. and In my confu-
sion I forgot where l was, forgot my

     

 

 

 
 

‘dom-unlt and suddenly you appeared:

amorphous and glowing. Still I knew It
was you. Then you came toward me
and your aura engulfed me until we
‘were one. I tried to analyze but my logic
was not working. Conclusions were
reduced to probabilities and the nor-
mal linearity of thoughts became like
multidimensional sensations. Com-
rade. I did not understand what was
happening yet I felt no fear. It was a
paradox: pictures and sounds that are
neither tangible nor recordable can not
be real, yet when I awoke the next day,
my bedgear was quite wet and the sen-
sations lingered like- the smell of
chemical waste. This naturally upset
me, because we all know thoughts are
Immediately erased and that we do not
sweat at night as the temperature ls
kept at 19°C.

I did not tell anyone about this
strange phenomenom because I knew
no one would understand, let alone
believe me. But when this occurred the
next two nights, I grew alarmed. After
the third night I was overcome with this
 feeling, so In my confusion I did
something very dangerous: consulted
the paperbound manuscript of 2nd
mlllenlum essays and poetry that l
have been safeguarding since my
adolescence when all fictional writings
were destroyed. With burning eyes and
a racing pulse. I poured over those
yellowed pages. The words I read had a
strange physiological effect on me,
similar to the night stage without syn-
chrosleep and similar to when l
recreate your Image In my mind. And
although I had no reference tool ex-
plaining the archaic terms and con-
cepts. l Induced several conclusions
based on context and the little I could
recall from the night-Images.

Day 4 l slipped out of sight and read
the little faded book from cover to
cover. On this Incredible journey
through the hearts and minds of an-
cient humans. I experienced such bliss
as | grokked those ancient messagesl
Luckily. I was not seen nor noticed
missing. But comrade, In my lsoletlonl
discovered something quite Inex-
pllcable: I discovered a part of myself
— perhaps of us all — that lies
beneath the epidermis, that Is
somehow linked with that faculty of
feeling-thinking that the ancients call-
ed emotion. When we escape the dln of
the motor that we are forced to main-
taln, there Is a beautiful peace. There Is
a pool of tranquility Into which we can
dip our fees or dive headflrst. In this
pool there Is not always order. and we
cannot always deduce reality. We may
even be a little unsure of ourselves and
each other, but the advantages are a
different nature: It‘s like you are a
multidimensional being whose apen~
dages extend above the stratosphere
and below the geosphere; In your brain
you can traverse any barriers and you
exist as more than a gear In some
smooth-running although predictable
system. You can see what does not ex-
lst and can . . . Imagine. You are free to
explore whatever pops Into your head.
You can . . .‘create. '

But comrade. this Is so fleeting; Im-
mediately the drone of the motor
returns and the thoughts follow the
same old grooves. Even now. I can no
longer retrieve those Images l describ-
ed. If I had not written It all down It
would have been lost forever.

Comrade, I hope you do not think
badly of me. As I said, you are a part of
this and I hope you understand. But
this Is dangerous and I realize you have
a lot to lose It you are caught. I wish
only to share the joy I have found In the
ancient book and In conjuring your Im-
age In my braln. It produces a feeling I
have never experienced. When Shelba
the Younger has her son. lwlli husband

.then and try raising the boy to sleep

without lela and to read the ancient
'tongua. Maybe you. too, could join us
and together we could . ..

I hear footsteps so I must end In
- haste. Greetings to your dom-unlt.

Tomorrow. as today. 09848-2210
