The following text was placed as the
final entry In what is commonly refer-
red to as "The Time Capsule." This
storage of knowledge, containing. ar-
tifacts dating as far back as the begin-
ning of time, Is buried beneath an area
which was, at one point, known as
"The New York World's Fair." The cap-
sule has now been sealed, due to
government Intervention. This copy
has been salvaged for your reading.
These words will now be passed over,
until such time as the seal ls once
again broken.

Tomorrow as Today,

ometlmes I feel as If

there's nothing out there

for me to love anymore.

There, I said If; that word.

With all my paranoia, l
cannot picture myself using that word
in public without surrounding It with a
practical topic of conversation. It‘s
quite sad — but that‘s another one of
those words, Isn't It?

I know this sounds confusing, but
then again, so are my thoughts.
Besides, I Just can't record conclu-
sions from the spew of my hand and
mind. That's reserved for the leaders of
our world. No, l have to show.

It started back when I met the life
blood of my youth. She was beautiful
and had the most attractive eyes I had
ever seen; chameleon-like In nature.
they would change, with each new
season from an interesting combina-
tion of green and hazel, to a warrnlng
brown. They were deeply set and prob-
Ing In their sockets, and they were pro-
tected by a bouncy wall of wavy, flow-
ing auburn hair. As coverings became
more Eden-like, her body, like those In
renaissance paintings began to gain
more shape. Oh, by the way. please
understand my knowledge of art.
Cryonics can do that to you.

Anyway she had feeling for me and,

aside from her shyness, which made.
her even more attractive, we thrived.
But where was she in '38 when I was
fighting the Cambo war? She had
opted for security when I had been
swept from our dreams. We had never
been much for realism (much to the
dismay of our respective families), but
she had been tempted by reallty's slap

' In the face.

When I returned, shattered In both
ideals and body. she was the first I
sought to cure my bleeding heart. I
found her (after a long and arduous
search, which nearly tore me apart) do-
Ing the books for her fiance — a minor
media mogul "with potential" —- In his
first floor office In a small media-study
professional building. There she was,
Iordy lord. All dressed up In a smart
breast cover and business-like short-
short. Well, she was "busy," she said.
which was easy to assume, since the
books are all that matter anyway. But,
being insulted, I sarcastlcally Inquired
about her health.

"Fine. Just fine. And how are you?"

"I‘m doin‘ O.K., not too bad under cir-
cumstances."

She Just continued her programm-
lng, none of which I understood. She
was drowning In complications, and
my sincere feelings of reminiscence
and want, combined with my longing to
hold her, were soon dwindling away In
favor of deep regret and pity for her,
myself. . . the world. I turned and walk-
ed, watching her from the door for a
moment. She looked up, tearing herself
away from her life for a moment, and
stared at me with her winter-brown
eyes.

"Were you hurt?," she asked, almost
sympathetically with knitted eyebrows,
while staring at my bruises.

"And if I was — ,“ I started, but then
the feeling poured again and I con-
tinued with, "Well yes, and | — "

Suddenly the office door opened and
his head and upper torso slid out like a

. marionette. His Jet black hair, suit, and

eyes were horrifying, but she seemed

almost stimulated by his comic book
smile.

"Something going on out here Ihatl
should know about?" He threw me a
quick dirty glance.

"No," she said and reprogrammed.
His strings were pulled and, head and
body Inside, the door slammed shut.
She was unreachable. It was done.

I left the office and regrouped by
thoughts. I hadn’t had the chance to
think logically for quite a lime, and
when I finally did, I realized the severity
of my war afflictions. With my true
sense of "home" destroyed. I set about
looking for a doctor — any doctor. who
could take care of me, and wrap the up
Into a ball of security. I was too fired
for anything else.

"Doctor Donald Tierney, Room A"
was etched into a name plate in a Will
dow on the first floor of a professional
house, down the block from the media
building. Tierney had a few waiting par
tlents, but he took me In before any of
them. Shaking his head, he said. “How
long did you light In the war?"

"Oh, about two years."

"Did you ever speak with an army
medic about that," he asked, pointing
at the small strange scabs on my legs.

"No. not really. I haven't had them
for too long. What are they?"

I entered the hospital two hours
later, and remained there, under close
observation for seven days. I had incur-
red one of those "brand new quick
growing fatal tropical diseases” that
had no cure. For a while, the nuw‘h‘
were a pleasure to look at, and llit~
books, brought to me by my doctors.
Were quite refreshing and stimulating
However, as the pain in my body grww.
so did my mind‘s discomfort.

"I don't understand what's wrong
with this country," I exclaimed at my
doctor one afternoon.

"Why? What's the matter?"

"Do you realize that more and more
people are reading Junk. Thail're
reading whatever Is not good for
theml"

"Who cares about reading anyway."
he said bluntly. “Look, we've got
telecom, vldlcom, and computex. Who
needs books when all our education
comes from there?"

Sure enough. the doctor was right
He brought a receptacle Into my room-
turned It on, and left It on for thirty-six
hours without a break. At the end of
that period, I was mesmerized —— nm
by the power and wonder of education
and Its newest partner, but rather by

--.. - I ... .-
the leech relationship of these two.

"All the news that you want to 
The news that you need to  What
you must hear In order to . .. How we
feel you must think."

News It was almost all news. Good
news, bad news, molding news _ . . and
I don't mean nation or world molding
news either.

"They tell us how they think, and
how they feel we should look at what's
around us," said the same good doctor

who had brought In and then finally cut
off the waves of “education” that had
been tangllng my brain.

"Who are they," I queried.

“Those who record the news for us.
They're always right."

“Does everyone in the country feel
the same as you?"

"No," answered the doctor, "Not
everybody. But those who don't cannot
understand what‘s going on around
them. It‘s a new age."

I was sick of his Words. and after for-
cing me through another thirty-six hour
period, "For my own good," I begged
him to take out the receptacle. With my
mind and body getting weaker, I asked
the doctor, as a last request, to put me
In touch with someone who didn’t

u .

"understand" the new media. He
thought me delirious and asked, "How
would I know of one of those people?
What do you think I am anyway?”

"I Just want to further educate
myself. I've got to see why these peo-
ple are being so stupid," I lied.

"You'll never get an education
through stupidity. I learned that on the
receptacle Just last week."

"How about — " .

“Forget It," he said and left the
room.

It was a dying man's wish — my
own. I wouldn't stand for It all — all the
mind changing and "Improvement"
due mainly to man's own Ignorance.
They needed Information and the thirst
was there, but who had the tools to
satisfy the wants? The manipulators.

I knew something would have to be
done. but what? What can one man do
alone? Those who know have obvious-
ly been warned. Those who don't know
won't even bother listening to me. I'll
be sucked up. I thought, chewed and
spit out. not swallowed. But for some
reason, I knew I couldn't let It all go by
without a battle.

For the first time In a month and a
half, I struggled to get out of bed. My
rage swelled as I could feel the clamps
of medicine all over me, trying to
restrain me from reaching a vertical
position, like a set of polycanvas belts.
My legs burned and I groaned painful-
ly, but not loudly — I couldn't give a
clue.

I stood, despite the fact that m legs

weren't working, and I put on a robe. I
opened the door and moved out into
the hall. Faces of doctors, helpers. pro-
grammars, patients, were all turned on
me. It was like nothing I had ever seen,
and If the pain and fever weren't Inside
me, eating me away like savages, I
would have run. When I had made my
way to the front desk, the receptionist
asked, "Where are you going?"

“For a walk. Do you mind?"

"Where?"

I computed the hydrollft and began
to get defensive. The woman was star-
lng at me the way I had stared at the
bastard Brazllllans during the war.

"I need some air. l'm entitled to that,
aren't I?"

The hydrollft came. and I punched

DESTINATION: BASEMENT Into the
memory banks. I turned and watched
the receptionist computing her ter-
minal for search. I knew I had nowhere
to hide, and with that hOpeIess thought
In mind, my legs gave way and I sank
quickly to the floor of the hydrollft. I
could feel the motors move, and the
smooth sounding hum was beginning
to make me nauseous. My heart began
to beat more and more rapidly, and I
began gasping. When the hydrollft
opened, I found myself staring up at
four white suits all with black hair, all
looking down, each with two chins,
their bodies swaying In my torn mind.

"Interesting case, this one," said a
man with a mustache, his voice echo-
Ing wildly, almost to the point of In-
coherence. "The girl upstairs said
something about taking a walk. But
look at the trlosygloplasm on the
legs.” -

"Yes, but he may be an interesting
study," echoed the man on the right.

"I vote affirmative," said a matter-of-
fact womanly voice.

"Yes. A definite candidate. Let's
take him over to the lab."

I saw them all put their arms down to
grab me, and my animal Instinct of sur-
vival caused me to struggle, ever so
slightly, as my mind flooded with fog. I
held In a breath as my head rolled back
and my eyes rolled up. The breath
breathed and the body wilted. Fade to
black.

The only sensation I remember after
that was cold —— Incredible, Incredible

cold. A powerless, senseless, sedated
body, succumbing without reason,
without power of resistance, with
paralyzed teeth unable to chatter,
destroyed legs unable to shiver. I
became, In essence, a mesmerized
human Ice cube, Iylng prone In a
stream of my own dreams. For years
and years and years . ..

Locked In my own thoughts, I
became a human shell — dancing back
and forth between normalcy and
delerium. I was being tortured for.
my s/n by tortured minds. But for some
reason, I was holding on. for fear of
eventual destruction. Life was a fan-
tasy, almost a nightmare. I couldn't
deal with my world, their world. and the
