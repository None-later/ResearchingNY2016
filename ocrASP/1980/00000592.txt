Last evening's exhibition of
007-86-9999'e holodisplay left this
critic somewhat disgruntled. The au-
dience registered some surprise as the
Images began to unfold. Certainly
holograms 'are somewhat outmoded.

The current wave of mentaistlms are
enjoying greater popularity with the
novelty-oriented masses. Yet' the
medium of holograms has not, In this
critic's opinion, been artistically ex-
hausted.

Unfortunately, 9999's ill-timed and
poorly executed project will hasten the

 

   

of total strangers. (How the performers
found the strength or depravity to carry
this out is one for the psychiatrists.)
The plot. as 9999 refers to his
display's structure, Is an embarrassing
sequence of non-collaglst Images. A
young couple of heterosexual "lovers"
go through a series of encounters with
an orderly society. which In the and,
destroys them. Certainly we can
believe that such a couple, which
engages In coitus at every opportunity,
could not happily exist or long endure
In a society such as the Zist century
Namerlc. where their Individuallstlc
tendencies could not be tolerated. Yet
9999 tries to make martyrs — even

Steril Star's technical values left
much to be desired. The SD was often
lneffectual. or worse. tried to elicit an
effect rather uninteilectuai — dare we
even say emotional (an archaic word is
the only adjective which seems to fit
the director's outmoded technique).

The viewer. who 9999 expects to pay
to see his work, should be advised that
this bloated monstrosity ls both in-
sulting and subversive. Rumors are
already rile that the distributor intends
to withdraw it by the end of the week
anyway. as adverse critical and
popular reaction has been unanimous-
ly unfavorable. Apparently the director
was given an absolutely free hand In
the creation of his holodispiay. and the
producers didn't see any of It untli It
was too late to do anything about It.

More's the pity. Though I may be ac-
cused of being oid‘fashloned. i am still
stimulated by holodlsplays. and find
myself saddened by the thought of the
medium coming to a rapid end because
of trips like this.

The qnoup

With A new formulA fan sound

There was a time when words such
as synthesizer. mellotron, and se-
quencer were used to describe the
latest advances in the electronic music
world. Unfortunately, production of
these relics was discontinued In the

early part of the twenty first century as
they had become obsolete and rarely
used anymore. However, the release of
r=1,e = 2pi. the new compudlsc album
by the group x-x.13l +x.I5l-... Is a rare
treat. The band brings back the sounds
of these classic Instruments, while
continuing the trend towards increas-
ingly computerized music.

As anyone who listens to today's
music knows. x-x./3l + x.I51-... was one
of the first bands to experiment with
the total computerization of sound. As
one of the original members of the
band, Unlvac 9720-76. had stated when
the first album was released, "This Is
the music of the future." Well. it's been
nineteen years and forty-seven albums
since that first one was cut. and It
seems his prediction was correct. Un-
fortunately. 9720-76 is not around to-
day to see his prediction come true; his
existence was terminated by a short In
his memory banks.

His replacement and the newest
member of the band. Unlvac 19720-76N
(who was named for 9720-76 by the
way), adds technical skill that his
predecessor never possessed. but
lacks the programming skill of 9720-76.
Perhaps he will learn with time.

There are only two songs on this

microseconds. The first song is very
catchy. slow and steady circuit hum
unlike any i have ever heard before. it
brings back memories of early etx,)l2.
one of the classic older bands. This
unique and thoroughly enjoyable tune
climb the charts very quickly. Compos-
ed by Wang Muslcomp 27117. it also
comes as quite a shock to those of us
who never considered Wang a com-
poser of merit. Take the song EZ-
disc4000. for Instance, one of the more
foregetable songs off their third album.

The second song is one of the
band's best ever. It is an interesting
combination of white and pink noise In-
terspaced with magnificent twentieth
century type synthesizer runs using a
1982 production model Moog. The syn-
thesizer runs were all programmed by
the other founding member of the
band, Sperry-Rand 22-1010. This is a
very daring move on the part of the
band, as music of this type hasn't been
heard In over half a century. The band
is probably going to pull it off though.
because of the superb blending of
styles to create an unbelievable sound.
Given time this could even become the
beginning of a whole new direction In
music. Both songs are untitled. which
Is just as well because the name of the
album describes both tunes perfectly.

This album Is a must for anyone
serious about his music. it is a great
leap forward in the compustyle, and an
album destined to become a classic.

This was the first concert i'd seen In
almost fifty years. and I was dripping
wet with sweat from excitement. The
rest of the audience was staring
straight ahead like cold blue steel.
After one hour of impatient waiting and
many drink-pills, the band was beamed
upon the performance platform.

They ope‘ndd up with the title tune of
their second disc, Izopp Morkdqpp. The
audience did not react. They continued
to stare willie l, due to my previous
preference for this band. tapped my
foot. Of course, this elicited a few
stares, but i was prepared for almost
anything at an Olde concert. The as-

I thought the band sounded very
tight. and reminded me distantly of
something i'd heard before. but i could
not put my finger on It. The music was,
as on all of their discs. very com-
puterized and mechanical.

The next three songs were perfectly
blended into one another. to create a
"highly meaningful" medley, as one
observer shouted during the show.
(This person was immediately removed
from the club for doing so.) The medley
consisted of “ere Disease." from
their first hoiodlsc. X.SEC.RAY-SHUN.
"Promoeroma," from their third
holodlac of the same name, and
"Corpuzzle." from their fourth and
most recent holodiec. titled Pram/e

the decor of the club. Very, very luxe, It

charge of one hundred magabbcks. So.
If you are going to see a band you have
really been looking forward to seeing,
and you do not mind paying high
prices, be prepared to go home
buckiess.

But. back to the music . . . this show
was worth every megabuck, if only for
the thinking i did during It. Thinking
about what, you may ask? Trying to
recall what in Zorbax's name this
music reminded me of. I remember
when l was growing up. people con-
sidered my music notes. But I still think
that my music was better than some of
this new stuff. Try to mention to your
grandchildren such classic names as
the Schizolects or the Stalking Dreads

“ .. . this show was worth every
megebuck”

and see If they know what you're talk-
lng about. Chances are. they won't.

L. Ektrlk's vocals were highly In-
teillglble. and Marty Mike was (as
usual) flawless on drums. Oh. what I
would have given to have seen the
band. But unfortunately, that would be
considered passe.

Then. the band started a one hour-
plue set of what I consider trash. Just

more noise. i looked around the club
and saw a few feet tapping here and
there. When a voice came over the
loudspeaker and told everyone to stop
tapping. they momentarily stopped,
but of course started again. A new rule
at the club since the renovation of the
place is that you cannot tap your feet
until the band ls de-beamed, which is
useless. considering that the music ls
over, so why would anyone want to tap
their feet then?
i was told that at my next warning.
they would permanently confiscate my
pet computers, a horror I would not
even want to imagine. so I stopped tap-
ping.
The Humanoids were at: first
enlightening; I saw a glimmer of hope
down the road for today's kids, but
when they began their music. i realized
that the old days of post-war protest
music, my favorite, were long gone.
The unfortunate thing Is that now.
just as when i was growing up. bands
(feel they) must conform to what peo-
ple want to hear. Otherwise, no profit.

“How could he expect to create an aura

has been watched carefully by his
naturally suspicious superiors. but he
has produced some of our finest muse.
He mastered the use of the three-story,
digital beam computer system, and
has created musescapes of aural pro-
vlsimo. Of his many work-commando
musescripts. his most highly regarded
have included “Machine Muse," which
dealt with the many joys and rewards
of tank sifting In a utility plantation.
and “Luts Open Another Noggin,"
which dealt with the heroics of our ar-
mour boys in blue. who put "Rhubarb
In the furniture" (a memorable line).

SSS-882753 had wanted to use
"pure" instruments to create what he
called a more "human" effect for A
Solitary Soul. but he was justly forbid-
den. How could he expect to create an
aura of emotion through muse without
using any computer systems?

365 apparently feels he can do
anything. no matter how horrid it may
sound. To begin with. he mishandles
the highly schematic "Machino
Assemblage." which was developed to
re-create the many moods of our vast
environment. particularly the clickeiy-
clack of the plantation. The record
package notes that the "Machine
Assemblage" ls used to assimilate
"nature." but I don‘t hear anything
even closely resembling a plantation. a
K-Lone Observatory, or even a teenage
strobehouse.

New scapes like "Drahma of

Grasshop" and “Wood” are filled with
three-story system sounds but, if
anything. they depict the creatures at a
zoplum. or a “funrlde” through a
hideous forest at an amusement hall.
Only these scapes

re loom

 

of vigilant shrieks, empty of any sort of
logic and purpose. (483's mind must
look like pure garbanzl.)

365's scripts (which he. not the
three-story system. dares to sing) have
been the primary source of all the
hullabaloo, and for good reason. These
scripts are pure hokum — In fact, they
are downright pubic. The record
package describes them as being
united In scheme as "a portrait of per-
sonal disintegration." I'll go along with
that, but these schemes are absurd or
insane at best, with verses like: "You
cry out In your sleep/And all your fall-
Ings exposed." “Knocking on the door
of Hell's darkest chambers/Little
wonder, little wonder," and
“Wondering what will come next/I was
foolish to ask for so much." There Is
not one script about The National
Spirit or A Happy Day's Work.

365 never dares point out the exact
cause of his inner strife. but the im-
plications are quite dangerous — in
fact. unhealthy —— and i don't think he’s
going to getaway with this. injunctions
are already being pushed to take A
Solitary Soul off the market. Some
“human” effect! 365 sounds more like
a whining bushkuh baby, and we
haven't let that breed out of their holes
for years.

This may very well be the last recor-
ding by 365. But don‘t fret, people.
Tubiiiator Oscillator is coming out with
a new record after the New Year that is
reportedly made up of all new work —
commando scripts, and it promises to
capture the mood of our true natural
environment. In the meantime,
however. close your ear lobes and get

EXCLUSIVE

AN iurenview wirh TI'IE Child

They call him Child. They say he‘s The One. The Man. The Chosen. He can do
miracles. i went through the ghetto. through Megapolls Noreast, and talked to
the people who have been with him. They love him. Everyone i talked to said

Child was the one.

"i ought to know." one old man told me. “i've seen enough of them that

weren‘t nothin'."

So i went with Child. Getting an appointment wasn't easy. But Child, who Is
more media-shy than most ciaimed-Messlahs, finally agreed to see me. We met
In a simple room. with antique cushions on the floor. and curtains covering the
walls. He wouldn't let me photograph him. ("They will know me when they see
me, as they knew me before. ") What follows Is a transcript of parts of our con-

versatlon.

ASPects: Do you mind If I record our
talk?

Child: Not at all. As long as I receive
the only copy of the tape when you've
finished transcribing It.

ASPects: Why are you so determined
that your Image or voice not be
reproduced In the media?

Child: The first believers had to know
me without such aids. When I spoke to
them they had two choices: listen or
walk away. As they do now.

ASPects: Who were you before?
Child: Who I am now.

ASPects: Who Is that?

Child: i am who i am.

ASPects: Where are the bells coming
Irom?

Child: Oh. don't worry about them.
ASPects: Anyway, are you sure you
have that line right?
Child: Which line is that?
ASPects: "I am who I am?"
Child: How could I not have it right? I
just made it up now.
ASPects: Sorry. It seemed familiar. You
sure there isn't a choir around here
somewhere? (Child shrugs non-
committally.) Anyway, would you mind
explaining brief/y your basic tenets?
Child: They're simple. really. Quite un-
changed from the last time. Life here
isn‘t what‘s Important, the life after ls.
But you can't get there from here. Only
through the Son. Through the Son's
Son.
ASPects: Through the Son's Son?
Child: Through the Child.
ASPects: You?
Child: You said so, not me.
ASPects: Why are you so evasive?
Child: I am not evasive. The truth Is In
front of you. If you can't grasp it. don't
blame It on me. i have claimed to be
nothing but myself.
ASPects: In the Ghetto, they call you
The One, The Man.
Child: I am one man. i am who —
ASPects: Yes. we’ve been over that
one. Good line, though. Are you God?
Child: We're all part of God, i am not
the whole.
ASPects: One woman told me you do
miracles.
Child: Did she?
ASPects: Do you do miracles?
Child: Life itself Is a miracle.
ASPects: Not to be argumentative, but
that answer seems somewhat evasive.
Child: Sorry.
ASPects: Can you heal the blind?

Child: Some people think I can. And so
they see.

ASPects: Where are you from?

Child: Long island.

ASpects: I meant In a broader sense.
Child: I‘m from where all men are from.
I was born of man and woman. and t is
will of God.

ASPects: Was there anything about
your birth which was unusual?

Child: We are all individuals. Every
birth Is unusual in some way.
ASPects: In your particular case?
Child: You keep trying to pry. You con-
tinue to hope I'll do or say something
unusual. Something to prove that I am
what you know in your heart i am.
ASPects: Will you?

Child: i don't have to. Those who see
me know me.

ASPects: I see you. I don 't think I know
you.

Child: I think you do.

ASPects: Are you God?

Child: Have i said so?

ASPects: No, but that isn't the point.
The lac! that you make so few outright
claims is part of your mystique, and
part of the reason that so many people
are beginning to cling to you. I'll repeat
the question. Are you God?

Child: There are millions of people in
the world starving. Millions more are
spiritually starved. They seek answers
to questions they can't formulate. The
ancient scriptures that they haven't
read. but which are a part of their
culture and heritage foretell a messiah.
It's a part of their collective un-
conscious. They know, and they wait.
Without knowing why. they know a
leader is coming. and they know also
that when that leader comes. they "
know him.

ASPects: Are you the messiah they've
waited for?

Child: I never asked to be.

ASPects: But are you?

Child: Moses was chosen. He didn't
enlist. Jesus asked that his destiny be

ASpects: Are you saying that you have
been elected?

Child: The people have elected me.
ASPects: Has God elected you?
Child: Do you know the mind of God?
ASPects: No. Do you?

Child: I think i do. yes.

ASPects: How?

Child: i feel It.

ASPects: is that all?

Child: What more Is there? The truth
site before you. and you're afraid to
believe It.

ASPects: Do you think you’ll meet a
martyr's death?

Child: (Laughing) Only if l'm crucified
by the media. On that note l'm afraid
you'll have to excuse me. My schedule
today is quite full.

ASPects: A final question. All through
the Interview I've heard bells and a
choir. Where are they coming from?

Child: Bells?
