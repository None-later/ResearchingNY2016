Continued from centerfold

world I wasn’t seeing — the world at
the future.

"When It seems as II he Is recovering,
begin the slow de-oxyometer procedure,
and I'll begin suturing the wound."

I must be dreaming. I must really be
dreaming, I thought. To be drawn from
cruelty Into the reversal pain process. My
mind would last almost all oi the agony.
which would stay locked up. until such time
as freedom would allow It to flow through
my body with the ease of a river of molten
lava, skirting mercilessly down the sides of
a neutral and unprepared volcano.

All the cold wore oil, the tools of healing
took over. The disease was removed lrom
my legs through a serum. Injected when the
body temperature ls live-below. The warm
medicine traveled slowly through my
system from the twelve or so points of Injec-
tion, and helped to melt the cold from my
frost-bitten bones. The entire de-oxygen
process lasted approximately seventeen
hours. andIt was after this period that my
unused eyelids began to flutter.

"Greeting 100884313. Your cryonlzatlon
procedure has been completed and you are
once again ready to assume a normal lite."

"What? You've got to be. . . where am I?"

“Heal Station lorty~seven, section twelve,
studio seventeen. room tour."

I almost slipped back into my sleep, as I
llgured It was all a dream anyway. That Is,
until the good doctor gave me the whole
answer.

“It Is 2079. air. You have been under close
observation In our cryonics compound for
forty years. ten months, eight days. three
hours."

“Who am I again?," | asked. having iinai-
Iy Understood the numbers.

"100-843-4813, of course. Who else would
you be?“ ‘

the doctor to realize that I had gone by a
name when I fought side by side with the
Cambo's In 2038. They looked at me with
curlouslty, as It I were a freak of some kind.

"A few entries were missing toward the
end, due to some recording error on the
parts of those originally Involved. In-
competents. What I need Is completed In-
formation for the ills. Can you provide?“

"Well. sure, as much as I can remember. I
guess."

The dream was still on, I llgured. To be In
2079? How many were still alive? How many
dead? Do they really mean 2079? '

"Why were you entered Into this pro-
gram? The last entry describes your Illness
and nothing more."

"I was Just a normal Individual, and pro-
bably the only one chosen with my sllllc-
tion." I answered alter much thought.
"But," I continued cautiously. "I miss the
receptacles."

"What do you mean you miss them," ask~
ed the doctor sternly.

"I mean I lust havsn'l seen one In
awhile."

"You'll get your chance soon enough."

Three hours later, I was surrounded by
receptacles. each being attached to dll-
lerent sections of my brain. The dlllerent
waves of thought were received by dlllerent
brain waves. I couldn't concentrate on any
one thing, but was Instead bombarded with
thoughts.

"He Is not accustomed to this." said the
doctor to his assistant alter twelve hours oi
news." We must let him recover Iirst.
Transfer him to the front facilities."

I was transported, In the blink of an eye.
from my spot In bed to a chair on the iront
lawn. I was amazed at all the brilliant
technology. developed In such a short time
period. But then I thought. lor what pur~
pose? All these developments were lust
putting man Iarther and farther underneath
his or her peers. I looked around me. Recep-
tacles were everywhere. People's eyes,
ears. and brains were glued. In last all
senses were Involved.

no tears. All movements were still. There
was no sound of running and screaming
children at play. Children walked by, their
bodies straight and their movaments slow
and unsteady, In perfect Imitation oi their
parents

My legs had never ieit better, so I stood
from my seat and began walking. I wasn't
sure where I was going. but I had to get
away. that much I knew.

Street alter street passed In my wild
aching to get away. Peoples' blank stares
made me leariul and defensive. but I was
under control. A courthouse on the right, a
receptacle station on the left. later- on
buildings on the right. small supply stores
on the tell‘ and then a library. A very small
library. I made my way toward It. when I was
stopped by three men. all with black hair
and pale laces.

"Come feel the receptacle. You have not
done so today, have you?"

"Ol course I have. Out of my way."

I pushed them aside. Soon two more peo-
ple and then three others stopped me to In-
quire about my receptacle time. I couldn't
help but speak, as I tried to understand all
the madness.

"But It teaches you nothing." I whispered
hoarsely. tears walling In my eyes,
"absolutely — "

They were all staring at me coldly. They
seemed to be moving In toward me, searing
my brain with their blind relectlon.

“You bastards! Keep away. I'm not
yoursl"

I ran toward the library without looking
back. I punched the button and the door
shot open. I ran Inside and the door shot
closed. Three men and a woman moved out
front behind the front desk and laced me.
They had warmth In their eyes and the
'woman even smiled.

."What Is your number?," asked the man
on the left.

"My name is Roger," I answered,
breathing heavily. l was nearing my wits‘
end. I didn‘t care about llie or death, I Just

They brought me downstairs and tried to

Poor. Treatment

To the Editor:

_I am writing this letter in response to the
ill treatment I and many others have receiv-
ed from the JSC-Jewish Student's Coali-
tion. This organization, which claims to be
a facet of human rights, equality and
brotherhood. has managed to create a
climate of hatred. spying, and scorn; not
only among non-members but ntcmbcrs
with
“appearances,” this group claims to want

also. Concerned chiefly

 

new members. only to exclude tltcsc new

Thanks For Giving

To the Editor:

On November 18. I980 Albany had its
first snow. With twclvc inches of snow
covering the ground it was very difficult for
off-campus people. as: well Its those on crun—
pus. to make it to tltc podittrn. Despite this.
203 people came to tltc Campus Ccutcr
Ballroom on that Tuesday to dontttc blood
to the American Red Cross. this tttruout
was the second largest for that particular
drive date iii the last ten years in Albany! I
think this, in itself. says a lot about tltc kind
of people at this school. I personally cannot

   

think of a more unselfish act than this and
would like to thank all of those individuals
who were so kind on that day.

And for all those people out there whose
lives bcncfiltcd directly front your dona-
tions. I say thanks.

You people are the greatest.

is This Unity?

"Don’t think every white person who smiles is being your friend because
they 're not. Always remember we're a deck of cards on this white- walled cam-
pus. They are holding the deck and can cur it at any angle they wish. Only our
unity as a Third World people can stop this from happening. Have a produc-
live successful year at Albany State. "

The above is an excerpt from the October issue of Unity magazine. It was
written for incoming black students.

Those inflamed lines have disturbed us for quite some time. We’ve often
wondered just how fair they really are.

In case you haven't noticed, we are treading on lender and neglected ground
right now and we approach it with caution. It’s just that after reading through
the recent (December) issue of the magazine. we say it is high time that certain
areas are examined.

Now, tltc editorial leadership of tltc ASP is wltitc. so we suppose we can be
cited as owning a white perspective on things. Our doors, though. have always
been widc open to minorities. It‘s a shame that few Itnvc cvcr ventured in. for
we arc not racists.

Let's be frank. . .thc rcccnt issuc of Unity was an attack on every wltitc slu-
dcnt on this campus. Tltc cdi.ors nnd writcrs httvc cast cvcry Caucasian into a
singlc corttrtincr — irtto ii jar ntttrkcd ‘racist.' Is this fuir'.’ Is this accurate? We
bclicvc not.

The editors and writcrs persistently refer to our nation as "white amcrik-
kkit" and “tltc u.s." Thcir rucc. noncthclcss. is dcnotcd its zt capital “Black.”
Is it equality tltcy scck'.’ Is it tltcjoining togcthcr of all that they desire? Or is it
supcriorily and scgrcgution tluu tltcy long for? Wt: don‘t understand.

If tltcy choosc to bclicvc that Mr. R ’ilgtlll truly "finish off Black folks" and
that survcillttncc rind conccnlrruion camps arc "lltL' ncxt stops." tltcrt that is
tltcir pcrogutivc. But wiry must tltc Inrgc rtttrrtbcr of Arttcricuns who supportcd
Rcuguu bc rci'crrcd to its klrrnspcoplc? Many blacks supportcd tltc man too.

Is this Itow most black studcnts itl SUNYA I'ccl?

Docs this type of writing scrtc tltc ncctls and air tltc vicws of SUNYA‘S
black community?

Wc hnvc llll awful lot to Ictrrn frotn onc zru-uhcr and a univcrsity is probably
onc of tltc most l‘lcxiblc and progressive pluccs irt which to try. l-low lrctrllhy
ttrc tltcir' tilliltttlcs towurd fostcring interaction, communication. and coopcra-

Arc tltc editors and writers of Unity rcrtlly ittlcrcstcd in this cud? (it do tltcy
simply crnpltttsizc scgrcgtttiot., withdrawal. and rcvcrsc racism?

(iruntcd. America is no purudisc of cquality and nczntrps SLINYA has its
