Houston Oilcrs scored a 6-0 Na-

Pittsburgh, giving tltc ball away
fivc costly times — three on Terry
Bradshaw interceptions. twice on

as their tropes of a fifth Sttpcr Bowl
ring “One for tltc Thumb" wcrc

But emotion might play tltc big-

'l‘hc shutout was the first absorb—

couple of coaches I wouldn’t mind
seeing take a long trip back. i think
the playch will regroup." Simpson
said.

“That's one reason the Rams are
known as a player's team. No mat-
ter what the confusion, they get
together for the big games and they
go out and win them."

Frcc safety will be a featured spot
in the contest — Nolan Cromwell,
who replaced Simpson at Los
Angclcs. is one of the best in the
league. while tltc Bills planned to
reactivate chl‘ Nixon for the game.
Nixon led the NFL with five in-
tcrccptions in his first four games
straining a knee Oct. 5 against San
Diego.

Knox doesn't talk about game
plans. but he’s almost certainly
planning surprises for tltc defending
NFC champions and they could
mean a rclurn to tltc gambling,
first-down-pnssirig offense that got
tltc Bills off to a 5-0 start.
