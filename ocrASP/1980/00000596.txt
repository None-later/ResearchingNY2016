by Michael Carmen

The Albany State synchronized
swimming team is one of the lesser
known sports programs on campus,
but they do have a rather illustrious
history.

The team. coached by Pat
Rogcrs. managed to triumph at the
State and Regional Championships
a year ago. They also placed
seventh at the Dual National Meet
at the University of Michigan.

Synchronized swimming is not a
widcly acclaimcd sport. but has

requires gymnastic and ballet skill.

years if you want to count Billy
Martin twice.

“Why would you want to
manage this team?" a network
radio reporter asked, sticking a
mike undcr Michael’s nosc. Michael
didn’t ﬂinch.

::Wouldn’t you?" lie replied.
Well," persisted the inter-
rogator, “since George Stcinbrcn-
nor is a nut and kinda crazy. don't
you think you are in for a lot of
problems?"
"I don’t think George is a nut or
crazy at all. . ." the rookic skippcr

began to answer. thcn was intcr-
rrtptcd.

"I mean." said the rcporlcr. "ltc
v is very dcmanding and that makes
spccial prcssttrcs and problems in-
evitable. don’t you think?"

“Listen.” Michacl said irt sub-
dued toncs. refusing to lose his
cool. “I ant dcmandirtg myself. I
like pressure. I think pressure is
good. That’s what’s ttradc tltc

Although an open target as tltc
handpicked choice of Steinbrcnncr
to replace the popular Dick Howscr
on tltc Yankee managerial roller
coaster. he refuses to cringe under
suggestions that he will be a puppet
and “ycs titan" of the controver-
sial. tread-strong Yankee boss.

“I run nobody's ‘ycs matt.’ " he
insisted strongly. “I never have

been and never will be. George is ‘

answers. only opinions."

The system was expected to lead to lower scores. but Albany actual-
ly picked up on their initial score from last season, despite thc defeat.

“We did well for our first meet." said gymnastics coach Pat Duvall-
Spillane. “I was very pleased because we scored ten points higher than
in our first meet last year instead of lower. It's a nice way to start."

She added. “We handled the competition very well. The point
spread was not very big against a Division I school."

Individually. three Dane gymnasts scored qualifying points for
Regionals. To go to thc‘tournnmcnt. they must accumulate four points
over the course of the season. Senior captain Cathy Chemotti. Elaine
