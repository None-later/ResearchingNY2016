Voting'Rights Coalition Formed

by Nora Kirby

SA, SASU. and NYPlRG have
recently joined together to form the
Coalition on Student's Voting
Rights, according to Central Coun-
cil Chair Peter Weinstock.

The goal of the group is to raise
$2l,000 from statewide private and
SUNY schools to continue efforts
on litigation to gain the right for
studentu to vote in the county where
they attcnd school, according to

SASU Communications Director.
Pam Snook.

Snook explained that although
the ll SUNYA students won the
right to vote in Albany. the suit
still “fell short of being a class ac-

tion suit." A class action suit would '

mean the decision would be upheld
statewide, Shook added.

Snook explained that when
SASU was formed, in 1970, student
voting rights were only sought

SUC/ Cortland Studen ts to
BoycottRoom Rate Hike

in response to the SUNY Fall 1980 room rate increase.
SUC/Cortland's student Senate has passed a resolution calling for a
student boycott of the $75 increase for the Spring semester, according
to Cortland SA President Todd Friends.

The referendum to be presented to the students Wednesday and
Thursday states “l oppose the decision made in the summer of 1980 to
raise my dormitory rent $75 per semester for the l980—8l academic

“A lot of students were perturbed about the closed-door policy
decision." Friends rcnuu'kcd. He added that Cortland students have
been working for a binding housing contract with their local housing

llrucc Cronin, Campus Organizing Director for the Student

rights have been won in Albany
County. this should include the rest
of the state, she said.

Snook said winning the case
would result in students being per-
mitted to register and vote where
they go to school. “All students will
be treated as regular voters," she
said. and will not have to ﬁll out
questionnaires with extraneous
questions or provide documenta-
tion non-students need not provide.

SA President Suc Gold said the
present voting laws are “an
abridgemcnl of student civil
rights." A victory in court would
have incredible implications for
students and strident rights, she
said.

According to Gold. students
voting in their college communities
would “help make local govern-
mcnt officials responsive to student
needs."

Gold added that students are not
looking to take over Albany
government but are looking for
recognition from elected officials as
members of the community.

cases on a lack of research and
preparation.He said the budget of
$21,000 is necessary to accomplish
what needs to be done. “Unless we
spend the money, students won't
get the right to vote," said Stern.

According to Stern. the bridge!
should be finished by the second
week in January. He said they hope
to get the money from student
associations statewide. including
SUNY Buffalo, liinghumton,
Oswcgo and private schools such as
Syracuse University.

SA Attorneys Jack Lester and
Lewis B. Oliver, Jr. estimate the
cost of the litigation at $21,000 and
itemized it in the following way:
$4,000 for expert witness and coor-
dinator of student interns, $5,000
for prc-trial discovery. $500 for
travel fees, $1,000 for trial
assistants. $500 for subpoenas an
$10,000 for attorney fees.

Stern said he hopes to have the
arse resolved in time for elections
next November.

Potsdam Bans “Beer Blasts”

UAS Freed of Taxes on Mohawk

by Wayne Peereboom

UAS has recently won an appeal
which immunizes it from paying
school or property taxes on their
95-aerc Mohawk Campus property.

On November 26. the Appellate
Division of the State Supreme
Court unanimously overturned a
1979 court decision ordering UAS
to pay the taxes in the towns of
Halfmoon and Clifton Park. The
Mohawk Campus lies on the border
of these towns. It is a recreational

site for SUNYA students.

According to Halfmoon Town
Attorney William Kcniry. the case
may be appealed to the state‘s
highest court. the Court of Ap—
peals. pending a decision from the
Halfmoon Town Board. UAS has
refused to pay approximately
$4.500 in taxes over the lust thrcc
years on the section which lies in
Halfmoon.

The issue is whether the properly-

Board ofRegents Votes

Increase in State Aid

The Static Board of Regents volcd on 'l'hursdny. November 20. in
New York City for u l0.2 percent increase in state aid to public schools
and to liccusc public school teachers.

According to the 7‘iIIIes«(/niml on November 2|. the Regents pro-
posed that $4.l billion be given to the state‘s upproximutcly 750
districts to bulnncc the tunount of money uvtlilublc in rich and poor

For school districts collectively. this proposal would increusc the
state's share in public school funding from 39-40 per cent. The Board
further proposed that state aid be given according to both enrollment
and attendance, tending to help schools in larger. city districts.

For years it has been debated whether students in poorer districts are
being discriminated against because less money can be spent on their
education than on students in richcr districts.

in a poorer district. such as Albany, where property is tax exempt,
there would be tut increase in old. In richer districts where there is a
larger amount of taxable property to gain funds. state aid would be
cut. This follows similar measures in New Jersey and California.

The Regents also voted to risk the State Legislature for $15.6 million
for licensing examinations for teachers. intern programs for new
teachers, in-service training programs for experienced teachers. and

status as an ctlucnlionttl institution.
According to Kcniry, it was ruled in
the first court decision (1979) that
the property was not being used for
“exclusively” educational purposes
so was ineligible for tax exempt
status. The townships cited that the
property had been rented for wed-
tling receptions and other events.

UAS. however, contends that it is
a private, non-profit company that
runs the campus for students at
SUNYA.

in regard lo the recent overturn-
ings. UAS Attorney Guy Rocmer
said the court “didn't change its in-
terpretation" but “saw the some
facts differently."

Potsdam. have caused drunkeness.
unruly crowds. and property
damage. The students, however. are
saying the decision was reached
without alternatives being examin-
ed.
“Students and residents had
ideas but the village was going to
put on the bill! no matter what ac-
tions could be taken," said Jay
Bcbb, president of Potsdam's Stu-
dent Association. According to
Bebb. the major issue is the right of
students to have a say in village
decisions. “The students represent
a big constituency in the village and
should have n say in important deci-
sions like the ‘bccr blust' ban,"
Bcbb said. adding that going
against the village was like fighting
a stone wall.

Students joined faculty. on unof~
ficinl citizen's committee, and mer-
chants to fight "the wall“. Peti-
tions were signed, boycotts of
downtown bars and stores were
staged. and rallies and demonstra—
tions were held both at Potsdam
and Clurkslon.

the ban were light. “Nothing major
ever got off the ground." he said.
Robertson added that nobody
seemed really upset over the ban.
even at a “semi-protest" last
"blast" on December 6.

Students have begun to examine
the legal aspects of the ban, and are
focusing on getting local voting
privclcgcs. “Students want to vote
in a town where they spend their
money. time and effort helping the
community.

“This issue is iust the tip of the
iceberg," said Bebb. ‘.‘lt goes much

Wellington is Too
Hot, Students Say

by Wayne Peercboom

Students living in the Hoth Well-
ington are leaving their windows
open on cold winter days and the
management doesn't like it.

“It seems wasteful to me," Well-
ington Manager Rube Gcrsowitz
said. “With the price of oil being
what it is, people just can’t do these
things.”

A student who had the windows
open in his ninth floor room said it
was “just too hot." Another blam-
ed the problem on the radiators
throughout the student annex. call-
ing them “old-fashioned." He ex-
plained that shutting off the
radiators did not help in cooling the
room off.

Gersowitz said he doesn't mind
students leaving their windows open
when they are in the room. The
main problem, he claimed. is win-
dows left open when students were
at school. A photo in Friday's
Times Union showed thirty-one stu-
dent annex windows open in the
early afternoon while the
temperature was in the low twen-
ties.

Ocrsowltz said the students
,haven't complained to him about
the heat problem. However. he said
that he has asked students to be
our ul about open windows. “1
plan to keep after ’em," he said.
