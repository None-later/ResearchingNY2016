Vandalism Causes CC Flood

by Judie Elsenherg

in an act of vandalism. a fire hose was opened last night in the Catn-
pus Center. causing extensive flooding in several areas, according to
Plant Department worker Wayne Daniele.

“Someone opened the cap on the fire hose at the top of the back
Campus Center stairs." Danielle said. "i don‘t know what the damage
is. We'll get someone to clean up the mess, though.“

The open fire hose created a waterfall in the rear staircase. leading
down to the Rat. The stream of water caused approximately one inch
of water to flood the cafeteria, the stairwell, and the kitchen and din-
ing area in the Rat. The Rat’s kitchen closed for the nigltt at 9 pm.
due to flooding.

“Students expect ‘TV‘ advise-

ment where all the options are laid ,

out in front of them,” said Pre-
Health Professionals President
Rick Dalby. “Students should ask
questions. The'information is
there." Dalby and other students in
attendance felt that SA's initiation
of peer advisement at pre-
registration was a positive tnove.

However. Pre-Law Association
President Brad Rothbaum said he
has seen no proactive steps taken on
the part of the administration over
the past four years. And Gold noted
that there is “very little rapport bet-
ween student and advisor. The
faculty have very little interest in
students."

“The one titittg that students
must learn," said Rothbaum, “is
that titey have to be aggressive. This
school has a lot to offer, and no one
will eontc knocking on your door."

Commenting on this, acting eo-
chairpcrson of Telethon Judy
Greenbaum said. “You cannot
push people ittto something they are
not. We must show students there is
no tremendous wall before them."

The one uncontested issue was
the quality of academics at
SLJNYA.
