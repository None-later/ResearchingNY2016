'Ther'Cruising Controversy

. __taea3lmﬁ

it's .apparent that the controversy sur-
rounding William Friedkin’s Cruising still
hasn‘t abated. it’s really a pity. more for

reasons of watching people protest a film

most of them haven’t seen, than for reasons
of defending the film itself.

1 reviewed the film Cruising last year.
when it ﬁrst played in the theaters. i didn’t
think it was a great film. or even a very
good one. I did think it was a fair thriller.
though one which would have attracted lit-
tle attention if it didn't star Al Pacino and
didn’t deal with gays.

,The gays have led the protest movement
against Cruising from the start. it seems
evident from their complaints that they
haven'tseen the ﬁlm, or that their opinions
were decided before they went into the
theater. Cruising does not deal in any
substantive way with the gay community.
it. in fact, carries a disclaimer to this effect.
it is about the Christopher Street S & M.
heavy leather crowd. and while it may not
have even dealt with this aspect realistically,
it. doesn't have anything to do with the
mainstream gays.

The only “normal” gay characters in the
film are treated sympathetically, and not all
the heavy leather afficionados are pro-
trayed as sadistic freaks.

The film was accused by a number of
groups as being excessively violent, another
complaint I take issue with. The film is
violent. but not in any unprecedented way.
The Godfather, now generally regarded as a
modern American classic of the cinema,
was as. if not more. violent than Cruising.
There are a couple of fairly brutal kniftngs
in the film. and I wouldn't even attempt to
claim that the squeamish wouldn't be
bothered. (Some violence should»be ex-
pected in a suspense thriller. especially now
with an R rating. and if you're offettded by
it, don’t go.)

Albany State Cinema is showing Cruising
on campus this weekend. As should be ex-
pected, its screening is expected to be
greeted by protests from the ﬁlm's detrac-
tors, and probably standing room only at-
tendance. Chances are. the print shown will
be the now expurgated version insisted
upon by the Motion Picture Association of
America. (The MPAA claims that certain
changes were agreed upon by Friedkin and
United Artists for the film to receive the R
tag, rather than the X they claimed it

deserved. and that Friedkin rcnegged on his
agreement and showed the original ver-

sion.)

Cruising is flawed by a superficial and a
tendency on Friedkin's part to indulge in
voyerlstic sequences in the gay bars, rather
than on keeping the script moving. in
places, however, he achieves some
remarkable nonverbal sequences which
become truly chilling. James Contner's
cinematography is excellent. As usual,

Pacino gives a fine performance. if you

haven’t seen it, go ahead. it‘s a curiosity

piece. and you might as well see what all the
fuss is about. i hope you won't be too
disappointed. ‘

The gays haven't been able to hurt the
film all that much. and i doubt that they
ever will. The overall mediocrity of the film
hurts it more, and as has been the case with
so many banned and protested works. all
the fuss and furor does is build up audience
interest.

The increasingly vocal conservative fac-
tions of the country seem to have intruded
into the gay movement as well. it seems
ironic (bitterly so) that the homosexuals of
America. while demanding their rights to
live as they choose must try to restrict ar-
tistic expression and mass-entertainment to
suit their own standards. Cruising may or
may not be defensible artistically. This
seems to be beside the point. We do not ban
bad movies. if enough people are offended.
bored or outraged. the film will fall into
commercial oblivion. Anything else is an
impingement on free speech. How can one
of the most maligned and unfairly treated
minority groups in the history of the Union
advocate such a thing?

if Cruising is deemed by its ultimate
critics. the middle-class moviegoers, to be
tasteless. exploitive or offensive. it will van-
ish. Or perhaps it will join such other
tasteless. exploitive or offensive movies as
The Towering Inferno, A Star Is Born. or
The Rocky Horror Picture Show as cult or
popular hits. The people who pay to be
entertained judge.

As stated before. Cruising does not
misrepresent the gay community bacause it
doesn‘t represent it all. All the gays are do-
ing is hurting their own image. The semi-
hysteria with which they've received Cruis-
ing has merely served to reinforce the
stereotype. No one is being forced into
theaters at gunpoint.

And no thinking adult is too likely to
take kindly to any minority group telling
him/her that he/she shouldn’t go see any

 

Raising Questions
To the Editor: ,

i am writing in reference to the editorial
on Friday, December 5, titled “is This Uni-
ty?"

i feel that rather than condemning or
criticizing the feelings and emotions ex-
pressed by black students writing in Unity
magazine. it would be more appropriate to
listen to what these students are saying and
examine this institution to see if they are
justiﬁed in expressing what they believe. i
think these questions should be raised. ls
Albany State from its administration to its
curriculum geared toward a white racist
perspective? Are black students shut out of
the mainstream of life at Albany State in
subtle and sophisticated ways? Docs
Albany state have an effective affirmative-
action program? Why are there so few
black students? Why are there so few inner
city students? Are there any administrators
responsive to the needs of black students in-

stead of the needs and demands of SUNY
Central? is the curriculum at this school
properly addressing America’s role in the
exploitation of blacks and Third World na-
tions? Why are not white students active in
aiding black students in their struggle to
overcome many of the barriers this country
has created in their struggle for equality?
How many residence staff people are train-
ed in addressing interracial problems?

i feel it is the alienation and concern pro-
perly felt by black student on this campus
that is being expressed in Unity and it is the
role of the white students on this campus to
attempt to ask themselves why this feeling
exists.

Unity: Disunity

To the Editor:

lam writing in response to the editorial in
the December 5 issue of the ASP. l
wholeheartedly understand the editor's sen-
timents in regards to Unity. i think this
magazine is a piece of racist trash. It scents
to me that the people who write for Ulrin
are a bunclt of hypocritical higots: lnstend
of rallying support for the black movement
with constructive idcrts. they constantly hit
the white majority over tltc lrctrd with
cheap. pcjortttivt- comments about rm op-
prcssirtg white race. .ltn-t us some “Archie
Bunker" types luttrp rrll blacks together its tr
lazy unproductive pttrt of American socie-
ty. so too does Unin mukc tlti trhsurd
generalization that each white is against
black progress and equality.

 

 

movie because someone else is offended.

How can the editor of Unity correctly

black folks." What facts and figures does
she give to support her statement? it Seems
to me that for the past twenty years
employers. schools and organizations have
progressively given blacks more of a fair
shake. Would the colleges of thirty years
ago ever consider offering EOP courses?
Obviously. the black American has a long

‘ way to go as far as total equality is concern-
ed. But certainly in recent years tltcre has
been some progress made which reveals an
effort to undo the wrongs done to the black
race. is Unity helping this progress? Is it
helping the cause to capitalize "black"
while leaving “white” in lower case?

Racism is a hard problem to deal with but
do blacks really help their movement by
pointing out “white cloud" as a racist forth
of bathroom tissue? White supremacy is
hard to overcome but it certainly won't be
helped by a magazine which advocates tr
horrendous racism of its own. tztrsy
assimilation is certainly not possible for tire
black race. The color line is a ltard barrier
to overcome. but with a desire to attain an
education. and a place in society, so too
comes respect. Blacks today are given every
opportunity to make something of their
lives. Obviously not every black American
has had an easy time and hasn't been op-
pressed. But what about the poor whites.
Puerto Ricans, Chicartos. etc. The list it.
endless.

As for Unity, it does nothing to crcttlc
unity at SUNYA. it may unite the black
students but what about the (lisunity it
causes among the student body as a whole?
I resent the reference to “Amerikkka”
which implies each of us has been a member
of the racist Klu Klux Klan organization.
An excerpt from "Ten Black Command-
ments" reveals the absurdity of this
magazine: “We must stop imitating the
degenerate actions of white people. whose
order diametrically opposscs to the
legitimate aspirations of the block uttd other
oppressed peoples." This is the ultimtttc
paradox: What are these rebellious
militants doing irt a university if not llspir-
ing to the already set values of the (white)
rrtujority? I'm sure each black is not hcrc
simply to unify the black movement and
overcome white oppression.

l lttrvc been at SUNYA for two years. and
besides historical and geographical pieces
on black lenders and places i have found
nothing constructive or unifying about this
racist mnguzine. i call for a rcorgnnirution
of Unity (can u dig it?) with a dccpcr
evnitrtttion of black students’ needs and
constructive insight irtto helping the block
cause. and the problems blacks face withitt
the SUNYA community.

Racism: Here 3 Now
To the Editor:

As a white student on this campus. l was
rather embarassed by the self-righteous.
racist editorial of last Friday. You wrote
“now the editorial leadership of the ASP is
white. so we suppose we can be cited as
owning a white perspective on things."
Why the suppose? Does the editorial staff
have a black perspective on things? I really
find that statement. along with the rest of
the editorial quite ludicrous.

As for the editor of Unity "casting every
eaucasian into a single container marked
racist" —- speaking as a Caucasian. i would
ttttve to say that Unity is pretty accurate.

Later you write. “We have an awful lot
to learn from one another and a university
is probably one of the most ﬂexible and
progressive places in which to try.” To this
I ntight add if you are white. Does the
editorial staff call being on in a 99 per cent
white class, learning all about tlte attributes
of the wltite man. a flexible and progressive
atmosphere for the black student? Whom
are you trying to kid?

As for “Why can‘t wltite students enjoy
reading the magazine too?" Maybe in your
next editorial you should ask why black
students can’t enjoy reading most of this
country’s publications. attending tnost of
this university's classes or writing for the
Albany Student Press. The answer is simple
— racism.

Perhaps. the editor should work a little
harder on broadening his “white perspec-
tive” and step down from his reactionary
white soapbox to realistically examine the
dynamics of racism.

Give JSC A Chance

To the Editor:
On Friday. December 5, an anonymous
letter to the editor was printed severely
criticizing JSC-Hillel. To write a response
is. for me, a painful task. But i feel i must.
since my three and a half years of involve-
ment in the organization and its leadership
is to some extent responsible for the way
JSC-Hillel functions. i must note that i
take a great deal of pride irt my work with
JSC-Hillel, artd in the accomplishments of
the organization.
it is easy to criticize front the sidelines.
Far more constructive is to get involved or
at least approach tltc leadership with your
point of view, positive or negative. Since
those who put in their time seldom are
thanked for their effort, 1 will take this op-
portunity to publicly thank them for their
service. Thank you:
1 To the students who weekly visit the
Daughters of Sarah Nursing Home irt
Albany.

‘ To the students who sat at tables signing
up people for the Blood Drive.

‘ To the students who sat all tables for it let—
tcr writing campaign to the Soviet Uttion.
' To the students who concern themselves
with missionary and cult groups on campus.
' TO the students who wrote articles for.
edited, typeset, and laid out the issues of
The Spirit.

' To the students who lead services every
week on campus and who struggled during
the Your Kippur fast to lend those services.
' To the students who advocate tltc cause
of lsracl on campus.

° To the students who raise funds for the
United Jewish appeal.

’ T0 the students who work with the
leaders of the Albany Jewish community on
many issues.

' T0 the students who work with the
leaders of the Student Association and
other campus groups to insure u balanced
and effective array of activities for this
campus.

' To the cltairpeople of fourteen commit-

tees who work and work and work to do

their best.

' And ﬁnally. to the five Executive Board
tmembers who bust their guts. putting tn

Over twenty hours a week each. to create

 

 

nttd maintain a Jewish community on this
campus at great personal emotional. social.
and academic cost.

To all of you i say thank you. since ap-
parently no ,one else will!

i could go on much longer with many
more thanks. instead I will urge every
Jewish student on this campus to give JSC-
Hillcl a real chance. i challenge each of you
to seek your Jewish identity and to work
with us in creating a vibrant and Jewish
literate and committed community.

Co-op Accomodates

To the Editor:

Being managers. consumers. and ruost
importantly. tax paying students. we feel
Matt Haddad (“Albums Hitting Record
Prices" Nov. 21 ASP issue) has-done a
serious injustice to the reputation of our
student run Record Co-op. It becomes ob-
vious upon reading Matt‘s article that the
reporter failed to even set foot inside the
store. By doing this he has overlooked the
real meaning of a cooperative which is to
work or act together willingly for a corn-
mon purpose or benefit.

We work extremely hard to cater to all of
the students’ needs supply tltcttt with an
up-to-dntc. varied selection of albums or u
very low price and offer each student the
convenience and opportunity of requesting
special orders —— creating tltc unique ut-
rttosplrerc of a personalized record shop.

Although there are obvious limitations to
our funds and available space. we are striv-
ing to expand our services and nccomodate
the needs of the entire student population.

Our efforts seem defeated when this
necessary student cooperation is dcrtied us
through such misrepresentation.

Exploitation

To the Iiditor:

Although the initial motich which corn-
pcl a group like Albany State Cinema to
show the movie Cruising may primarin be
financial and the intention of providing
entertainment. I’d hoped that tr third con-
sideration would surface. particularly
regarding this film. Unfortunately, Cruis-
ing perpetuates certain misconccpttous
regarding homosexuality, which relegates
gay existence to the unrncritcd realms of the
risque and taboo. Therefore. tltc showing
of Cruising is trttcr exploitation and any
pretense of cnrcrtuinmcnl simply dismisses
the realities of gay and lesbian oppression.
A meaningful sense of social awareness
ought to develop at Albany State Cittclua.
so that tltc notions of sensitivity and
fairness find themselves contending with
the profit mentality. which choose to totally
disregard the validity of guy tncrt and less-
binns.

Imagine

Imagine. "a local screwball," with no apparent motive other than a swift
cheap shot at some crude notoriety. destroying one of the most inﬂuential
musicians, poets. and philosophers of this century.

What a horrible. senseless waste.

it’s about as difficult as imagining “all the people. living life in peace” as
John Lennon once dreamed about.

Perhaps you were a dreamer, John. you wandered through life unlike most
— spreading the goodness of your music, seeking answers, and trying to
legitimize the existance of yourself and of others. And now. your search has
ended. A “screwball‘s” bullet has brought you the final reality.

But why? Why did he ttavc to kill him? Yeah . . . why do people kill? The
fact that his murderer was a deranged man should. however. come as no sur-
prise. John Lennon lived. lovcd, and communicated in a very deranged world.

Our generation owes a lot to the man. Not only are his lyrics and music still
cherished today -— but many of the social. sexual, and political freedoms that
we so enjoy now are due to barriers that ltc. and other pioneers like John.-
chose to wrestle with.

it’s certainly frightening that John Lennon‘s death should come at a time
when much of what he sung to us all has been relatively abandoned.

Think about it —— Criminal Nixon is now making the college circuit and ear-
nittg a fortune. attitudes on grass are beginning to stiffen, our president-elect
has hailed Vietnam as "a noble cause," and Mr. Reagan is about to begin the
greatest weapons build-up the world has yet seen. Jerry Rubin is rich on Wall
Street. Abbie Hoffman is collecting off his autobiography, Bob Dylan has
decided to serve somebody. the much hated draft may be back to haunt us. the
ghettos have been forgotten, and socialism is still a naughty word. And now
John. An era of love. idealism and insight has been wrapped up like the ﬁnal
saga of a confusing soap opera. And what have we all really learned?

Btrt John Lennon is not completely dead yet. Madison Avenue and the
American mass ntedia will soon begin the crucifixion. We've seen it happen
before -— the “Elvis process" -— artd we'll witttess it again. Watch for the ex-
ploitation; the magazine features, exclusives, the never-before-released
albums. bronze statues, gold placqucs. impostors. rumors. and mail-order
memories — all for just $9.95. Watch corporate America make a fortune in
the dcstrttction of John Lennon.

And this. too, will be a horrible. senseless waste.

But tonight. outside the Dakota in New York, a.crowd of people simply ,

stood and stored and wept — they'd seen his face before.

.lohn Lertnon, you bestowed on us a heavenly gift —-— your thoughts. your
words. your ideas and your music.

You were a dreamer. John. but you're not the only one. and the world must
thank you for that. .

Rest in peace.

"Though tomorrow may rain. l’IlfoI/ow the sun. "
—— John Lennon
