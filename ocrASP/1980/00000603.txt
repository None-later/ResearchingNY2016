Ex-Beatle Lennon is Murdered

continued from from prigc
Lcnnons had bccn at a studio callcd
thc Rccord Plunt irt tnidlowtt earlier
in ihc evening and that Lennon lcfl
at 10:30 p.m. Lcnnon said he was
going to gct u bite to cut and go
home. Douglas said.

A bystander. Scan Strub. said he
was walking south ncrtr 72nd Strcct
whcn ltc heard four shots. He said
he came around the corner to Gen—
trnl Park West and saw Lcnnon be-
ing put into the buck ofu police car.

Some people said they heard six
shots and said Joint was hit twice."
Strub said. “Police said he was hit
in the back."

Hc said others on thc strch told
hint the assailant had been
“crouching in the archway of thc
Dakota . . . Lennon arrived in the
company of his wife and thc
assailant ﬁred.“

He said the suspect. a "pudgy
kind of man" 35 to 40 years old
with brown hair. was put into
another police car. .

"He had a smirk on his face"
when police took him away. Strub
said.

Early today. police charged Mark
David Chapman. 25. of Hawaii.
with murder. No motivc was known

Yelling “I'm shot." Lennon stag-
gcrcd and collapsed face down after
the shooting at 10:50 p.m. Monday
at the Dakota. 3 century-old
building at the corner of 72nd Street
and Central Park West. Police
rushed the former Bcatlc to
Roosevelt Hospital. a mile away. in
a squad car.

Nearly 1.000 pcoplc — some
keeping a stunned. silent vigil.
others weeping and still others soft-
ly singing Beatles' songs -—- jammed
the streets and sidewalks around the
Dakota. where Lennon. his wife.
and their 5-year-old son. Scan. llv-

Hundreds of fans lit candles and

ringcd the hospital in silcnl tribute.

“So brilliant. so giflcd. so giv-
ing." said Sid Bernstein. who pro—
duced the Bcrttlcs’ Shca Stadium
concerts of 1965 and I966. “Hc was
thc Bach. thc Bccthovcn. thc
Rachmaninoff of our time.“

Police said the gunman crttcrgcd
from the shadows as tltc Lcnnons
stepped out of a Iirnousinc after a
recording session and walked past
the Dakota‘s giant iron gatc into the
archway.

According to authorities. Chap-
man had come to New York frotn
Hawaii about a week ago and had
been seen near the Dakota three
times in the past three days. As Lcn-
non left his recording studio earlier
Monday. Chapman got his
autograph, police said.

“Mr. Lennon?" police quoted
him as saying before he allegedly
fired five shots from a .38-calibcr
pistol.

Lennon. with three wounds in his
chest. two in his left arm and two in
his back. stumbled into an office
and crumpled to the floor.

“I'm sure he was dead when he
was shot." said Dr. Stephen Lynn.
“Extensive resuscitation efforts
were made and despite transfusions
and other methods he could not be
revived."

Police. who found the gunman
standing near the scene with his
pistol on the ground. were consider-
ing the shooting “just as important
as the assassination of John F. Ken-
nedy." said Lt. John Schick.

1t was not until last summer that
he returned to music. and his
I4-song album. "Double Fantasy."
was released last month. The
album, which Includes songs by
Miss One. 15 based on Lennon's ex-
periences over the ﬁve years. during
which he kept house. cooked and
cared for their son.

Lennon. who turncd 40 on ()c-
tobcr 9. was responsible for writing
many of the songs that launched the
Beatles iii the early 19605 and
chungcd thc coursc of rock music.

In an intcrvicw earlier this year ——
his first major interview in fivc
ycars — Lcttnon said he had wanted
to Icnvc the Beatles as carly as 1966
but did not make the move until
four years later becausc hc “just
didn't have the guts.“

Aficr the Beatles broke up in
1970. Lennon continued writing
songs and recording. But in 1975 he
dropped out for five years, saying
Itc wanted to be with his son. Scan.
and his wife.

Lcnrton rockctcd to fame as
guitarist. singer and songwriter in
the early '60s with fellow Beatles
Patti McCartney. Gcorge Harrison
and Ringo Starr.

With McCartncry. he pcnncd
hundreds of songs for the group.
and the Beatles cut 25 albums
before their breakup in 1970. They
also made fivc films.

Lcnnon and McCartney first
teamed up as teenagers in 1957 and
wrote “Love Me Do" when Elvis
Presley was at the top of the hit
parade. The song was their first
release in 1962.

That’s the word from Dr.
Thomas Gates. a mental health
counselor at the University of
Virginia who says the gator shirts
symbolize a return to a “prcppie”
trend sweeping the nation's cam-

Gates says that the preppie fad
has begun to have a negative effect.
both scholastically and
psychologically, on students who
can't meet the image.

He says that students from less
fortunate socio-economic
backgrounds have a hard time keep-
ing up the image. including buying
such things as alligator shirts. As a
consequence. he reports some
