Grapplers Disappointing Again -

by Larry Kahn

It will go down in the annals of
Albany State sports as a day of in-
famy. This time the invaders were
the likes of Potsdam. Cortland,
Blnghamton andi Hudson Valley.
Never has so much abuse been
delivered in University Gym in one
day with Albany teams on tlte
receiving end.

Nothing can top the entotioual
devastation of the Potsdartt basket-
ball loss, but some early season
disappointment of a prornisittg
young wrestling tcant started off the
miserable day. Just ntintrtcs before
the .I.V. basketball team‘s big loss
to HVCC. and hours before tItc in-
credible Albany-Potsdam battle.
the grapplers lost three consecutive
matches to confcrcncc rivals Cor-
tland. Binghamton. urtd Potsdam.
dropping their cottfcrcncc record to
04.

With only one more conference
match before the SUNYAC churn-
piortsltips in February. things are
rlot looking very good. btrt accor-
ding to Albany assistant wrestling
coach Mike Paqucttc. tltc tctrrn‘s
performance on Saturday is no in-
dication of their SUNYAC tourna-
ntcnt potential.

“We are a rtttrclt bcttcr tourna-
ttterrt team titan rt dual match team
right now. We have rt few players
who can pull the learn score up with
their performances." he said. “I
thought we could Ituvc wrcstlcd bct-
tcr. I think we're a Itcltcr team than
we showed today."

The losses to Cortland and
Ilirtghnmton wcrc rto great surprise
— they are arnortg tItc best teams irt
Division III. “We wcrc up against
tough competition. Cortland and
Biughamtort arc tltc second and
third best ill the SUNYAC." srtid

V Paquctlc. "And the cortfcrcrtcc is it

very good conference. SUNYAC
places ruore All-Americans than
any other Division III conference.“

TItc loss to Potsdam, their first
oppottcrtl. was lt littlc tougltcr to
handle. “We got off to a slow start
— we took them a little too light-
ly." admitted Paqucttc. “We
wrestled a lot better tltc last two
matches.”

Potsdam devastated Albany in
tile first match. 34-11. The Daries'
only points came from wins by An-
dy Scras and Vic Herman. and
draws by Spiro Tlteofilatos and
Dave Straub. Scras dominated in
his match. 15-4, but Herman had a
tough tirttc with Scott Stewart. The
match was scorclcss until Herman
was awarded lltrcc poirtts for a near
fall as tiruc ran out.

Bitlghttlttlttlt also had little trou-
blc with Albany. rorttping 37-9.
Herman got tltc full on John Young
at 3:47 and Thcofilatos oulwrcstlcd
.lirn Brrrult, 10—3. for Albany‘s scor-
ing.

Tltc Dttucs ttlrrtcd irt tltcir best
performance against it highly touted
Cortland squad. bltt lost. 27-16.
Scrus. 'I'hcofilalos. and Herman ttll
won decisions. tllltl Mark Goosseus
took it forfeit in the heavyweight
division.

On tltc whole, it was a pitiful pcr-
forrtrrrrtcc, btrt l’rlqtrcttc found
solllcc irt lltc spirit the Icrrm slrowcd
dcspitc thc rtdvcrsity. "We had rt
slow start rlgairtst Potsdam and got

"I was plcrrscd that after gcttirtg off
to such a slow start they didn‘t just
lay down and dic.“
