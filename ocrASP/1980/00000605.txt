The Albany State women’s
basketball team looked rejuvenated
in both their games this week. They
won over a strong Plattsburgh
team, 51-46 at University Gym on
Friday, and lost a heartbreaker at
Castleton, 59-70 on Saturday. Both
games showed how much the Danes
have improved. No nerves bothered
Albany this time.

Against Castleton, the women
got off to an extremely slow start,
only scoring 14 points in the first
half. An almost total lack of offen-
sive rebounding kept the Danes
from getting more than one shot
each time down the court. Albany

 
  

fense, not moving aftd completeing
their offensive plays. Defensively,
though the women were excelling.
Quick hands and feet kept the Spar-
tans from scoring even more then
they did with their tough outside
shooting. Carol Wallace continued
her line defensive play, along with
freshmen Jackie Golden. and Chris
Cannata.

The second half proved to be a
completely different ballgame for
the Danes. The women came out on
the floor with a revived lineup:
Golden, Lynne Burton, Nancy
Halloran, Luanne LaLonde, and
Chris DeSantis. They started out in
a hurry getting six quick points, all

press. The passed well. and hit the
open man down court.
The game began to get very

physical, with the referees beginn-

ing to lose control of the game.
Aggressive Cannata got three quick
fouls in the ﬁrst three minutes of
the second half to send her to the
bench, hurting the Danes. But
LaLonde, playing like she did last
year when she lead the team and
was their MVP. came alive. Grabb-
ing rebound after rebound, poun-
ding the offensive boards. she
began to lead Albany back.

They chipped away at the 18
point Spartan lead down to nine
with 4:39 left in the game.

Burton. along with Wallace pro-

' vided much of the Dane offense

during that period. LaLonde con-
tinued her hot play until she fouled
out with 3:31 left. Peg Squazzo
tried to make up for the deficit, but
even her good rebounding could
not fire up the team as LaLonde
had. “Luanne played the best game
1 have ever seen her play. When she
fouled out, the whole momentum
of the game changed," commented
Albany women's basketball coach
Amy Kidder.

Burton was the top scorer for
Albany with 16 points, while
LaLonde had 11 points (all in the
second half) and 16 rebounds.
l-lalloran, also a major plus off the
boards for Albany, had 10 points

 Rejuvenated women‘s Basketball .9qu Splits,

and 13 rebounds.

A totally different type of game
was played on Friday night. Platt-
sburgh, now 041, seemed evenly
matched to the Danes. Both teams
came out quickly. matching
jumpers until the Cardinals ran out
to a 10—4 lead, after 4:00 of play.
But Plattsburgh’s man-to-man
defense was soon to be the victim of
Albany assistant coach Chris
Behrcn’s new offensive plays,
which were designed specifically for
a man-to-man defense, and they
worked. Albany came back strong
led by Briggs and Wallace.

Briggs made clutch passes. and
had numerous assists and rebounds
(11). She continued to be the floor
leader she is very capable of being.
Wallace played excellent defense,
always seeming to be at the right
place for a vital rebound, and an
important basket.

“Offensivcly, we played the best
game we have played this season.
Behrcns said at halftime. Kidder
was just as pleased, “We are doing
a great job offensively and defen-
sivcly," she said. "The press is
working well, we are keeping them
from running right down the court.
We have to stop the turnovers on
the fast break in order to pull it
out."

The hall opened up with the
score tied, 22-22. For the first fif-
teen minutcs of the half, the two
teams traded baskets. Until finally
with the score 41-39 in favor of
Albany, Briggs, and Eileen Fat—
cltcric, got two consecutive jumpers
to make it 45-39. Along with those
two key baskets came two others,
which clinched the game for the
Danes. A breakaway basket by Bur-
ton, on a perfect play from an in—
bounds pass, and a pretty jumper at
the buzzer by Wallace, gave the
Danes the victory.

Again Burton lend the well
balanced scoring attack with 12.
while Fatchcric had eight, and
Hnlloran had seven. Cannata. had
six, as did Wendy Everleth. Briggs
and Wallace had five points apiece,
but those were probably the most
important points of the game.

"We were getting burnt in the
beginning because our guards were
coming out on defense, so we kept
them back and forced them to
shoot from farther out." Kidder
said. “Laurie Briggs did an ex-
ccllcnt job, showing us site can take
charge. Carol Wallacc also did a
super job for us. Plattsburgh did
not handle our press very well, we
kept slulling their offense."

Thc 1-3 women play tomorrow'
night against New Paltl in Universi-
ty Gym at 7:00 pm.

Oneon ta Barely Edges Dane Women swimmers

by Marc Haspel

Last season, the Albany State
women’s swim team lost convinc-
ingly to Oneonta by 38 points.
When the two squads met Friday
night, the Dragons came away with
the victory, but the complexion of
the meet was quite different.
Oneonta won 74-61. However. that
win was not secured until the final
relay in which they edged the Danes
by only 0.55 seconds.

"Onconta was battling
throughout the meet and each race
was won narrowly,“ said Albany
women‘s swimming coach Sarah
Binghum. “It was hard fought and
we were very competitive."

indicating that competitiveness,
the Danes set three school records
on Friday. The first came in the sc-
cond event of the evening, the
SOD-yard freestyle. Donna Staracc.
the team‘s butterflycr and sprinter,
was entered in this distance event,
and turned in a record setting time
of ten minutes, eight seconds.

in the 50~yard breast stroke
event, Robin Brown also set a new
school mark of 34.88 seconds, with
Ltturic Ann Buines coating in third
in that event at 36.72. Baincs went

on to produce a record time of

Craig Kinns goes up for a jumper in a disappointing loss against llntlson

  

 a .1 ah“-

1:19.18 in'the loo-yard breast
stroke while Brown ﬁnished one-
hundredth second behind that pace.

Other winners included Brown in
the ZOO-yard freestyle and Joan
Mieklcham in the diving events.
Brown finished with a time of
2:20.14. Mieklcham, who is
undefeated so far this season. con-
tinued that streak in both the one-
rneter and three-meter diving com-
petitions.

The Dancs were not swept in any
of the other events. in fact, Albany
took eight second places and nine
thirds.

In the ZOO-yard individual
medley, Albany took both second
and third with Anne Wilson and
Baines swimming :1 2:44.78 and
2:48.70. respectively. Beth Larson
and Joan Nugcnt yielded the some
results in the lOO-yard backstroke.
Larson clocked a 1:14.80 and
Nugcnt followed her with a 1:24.68.
Larson also added a third in the
50-yard backstroke.

The 50‘yard freestyle cvcnt saw
co-captnin Lisa Soinck time a
28.58, good cnough for u sccond
place. The frccstylcr also earned a
third with a 1:05.30 in lhc lilo-yard
cvcnt.

Gymnasts GetPsyched;
Dominate MountHolyoke

by Gail (ioldsleln

Saturday, the Albany State gym-
nastics team traveled to Mount
Holyokc for their second meet of
the season. They arrived psyched
for a victory and followed through
by dominating the entire meet and
achieving a 102.4 to 73.4 victory.
All the gymnasts performed well,
and Elaine Glynn took first place in
every event and in the All-Around
with a score of 29.8 (good cnouglt
to qualify her for the Eastern
Regional Championships).

1n the vaulting event. Glynn per-
formed a Yamashita vault and
received a score of 8.1 out of 11
possible 10. Following her in sccond
Place was captain Kathy Chemotti,
with a score of 7.85.

The uneven bars event followed.
Albany's first competitor. Chemot-
ll. performed a good routine.
However, on her sole circle full
twisting dismount, she landed in-
correctly and dislocated her knee.
Chemotli had been hopeful far a
ﬂood season after missing out on

last year's campaign tIllt.‘ to it
dislocated clhow.

Although the loss of the Ictllil'H
captain placed the DilliL'S at a distal-
vantage, “Kathy‘s nccidctn made us
more determined to win thc nicct."
said Albany's l.cc Eisner. This is ex—
actly what they did.

When the bar cvcnt rcsuuicd.
Glynn scored a powerful 7.55 and
freshman Elicia Sicinbcrg perform-
cd an excellent routine and scored a
6.9.

In the bnltnicc beam event, Glynn
attained n 7.2 and Eisner rcuchcd
5.9. Their performances and worms
were big improvements from their
last meet.

The floor exercise was the final
event of the meet. Glynn received 11
6.95. Following her was junior Ann
Sulsmcyer with a score of 6.2.

Albany‘s next mcct will be Satur-
day at 1:00 against the University of
Vermont in University Gym. This
meet will be tough cotupctition for
the Dane gymnasts. since Vermont
is a Division 11 school.

Going into the final‘event, the
ZOO-yard freestyle, the Dragons led,
67-61. An Albany win in this event
would have given the Danes the
meet victory, since seven points are
awarded on a winner take all basis.

Oneonta's foursome jumped out
to a few body lengths lead. but each
Dane leg of the relay gained some
ground. in the anchoring 50 yard
leg. Starace dove in at least two
body lengths behind tltc Onconta
swimmer. She nearly caught up and
was just toucltcd out by a bit over
over-half of a second. Onconta won
tltc event with a time of 1:52.73.

Still, the Albany quartet of
Sotnck, Fitxpatrick,Miekleham and
Starucc all qualified for state corn-
pctition with a 1:53.28.

That final event win gave Oneon-
ta the meet 74-61, evening Albany's
record at 1-1. The Danc‘s next tncet
is today against both Potsdam and
Russell Sage. Since this one will be a
triangular meet, liingharn will not
be abic to rely on her team's depth
in drawing the Dane's lineup. "It's
tough, bccnnsc we'll have to enter
only two swimmers in each event.
Wc cttn't use our dcpth so we'll
have to use a little morc thinking,"
said the couch.

Bad Execution Drops J .V. Danes

by Marc Ilaspel

'l'lic woes of the Albany State
junior \‘nrsily basketball team con-
tinued Saturday night. as the
jnyvccs were beaten by Hudson
Valley (‘otutnnuity College, 55-47.
The loss cvcuctl Albany's rccord at
2-2.

Problems in execution wcrc cvi-
dcnt again, and Albany had trouble
moting its ol'l‘cnsc. Littlc passing
rcsnltcd in a lot of outside shots.
loo trinity of which went astray.
Winn developed was the sttmc type
of play exhibited against Saint Rose
three days earlier —— sloppy and
nnorgnni/cd.

“'l‘his tctun is just not executing
the way it docs in practice," said a
disappointed Albany J.V. basket»
ball conch Rick Skccl.

Not being able to work the ball
insitlc on offense against this quick«
Iy pucctl Hudson Valley team,
Albany bccnnic very reliant on for-

ward Brian White. Dcspitc his six
first hulf buckets, White had it
generally ol'l' night from tltc out»
side. Right now, White is "the one
big man,” according to Skccl, that
the Danes have right now.

In the first half, Albntiy started
falling behind curly, yet was able to
battle back to take an 18-17 lead
with 3:38 left. Dennis l-lorn's
jumper, howcvcr, with two seconds
remaining gnvc thc Vikings a 21-20
lead, going into lhc half.

In the second half, the Vikings
just pulled away front the nort-
scoring Albany squad and led by as

' much as l'ii'tccn points with 7:57 on

the clock.

A Craig Kinns lay-up, a pair of
Dean Gracbcl baskets. a couple of
White hoops inside, plus it Bill
Evcrcll drive brought Albany
within ninc, 5142, with 2:43 show-
ing. At this point, Skecl called a
strategy timcout.

dislocated in the uneven bars event. (Photo: Tony Tassarotl)

But soon after play resumed.
Kinns was hit with a foul that sent
Viking Ron Bova to the line. Bova
was good for one, which extended
liudson Valley‘s lead to ten points.

With 1:10 on tltc clock, Everett
sank two free throws to pull Albany
within eight. But sub Willie Sotter-
field, who had a strong game. in-
tercepted a pass at midcourt, which
he quickly turned into two
unassisted points that killed any
Albany resurgence.

Everett hit one last bucket before _

tltc final buzzer and was fouled but

could not convert. it did not mati

tcr,'though. as it would not have
been enough to save Albany from
their inevitable loss.

The Danes have shown in the past
that they can work well together,
but they‘ve shown little indication
of that cohesiveness in their last two
games.

“The offense we run is good, but
we should be falling back on other
plays," said point guard Everett.
“The big guys have to do something
other titan shooting. when they get
the ball."

But more than that, Albany is
just not hitting their shots. “We're
not shooting well,” said Assistant
Coach Dave Pryzbylo. “That's all
there is to it."
