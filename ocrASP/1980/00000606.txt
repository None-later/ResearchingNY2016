it; was the first meeting of the
season between two talented basket-
ball teams. But it was more than
that. Whenever Potsdam and
Albany have met in the past, the un-
predictable and unexpected became
the expected. And Saturday night in
University Gym was no different.

,College basketball games are
designed to last 40 minutes. not 55.
This game had three overtime
periods — unusual. '

On three occasions. the game'

could've been won on the last shot
in the closing seconds — unusual, it
doesn’t normally happen that way.

But it was a typical Albany-
Potsdam confrontation.

it wasn't exactly a basketball‘

masterpiece. There was a stretch
where the Bears missed 14 con-
secutive free throws and hit only
one of 18. Neither teatn was par-
ticularly efficient from the foul line.
Albany hit on 10 of 19. but many of

the misses Were in the bonus situa- ‘
tion. Potsdam was a dismal five for r

28. and it almost cost them the
ballgame.

The officiating may have been a
bit suspect. with some questionable
calls for both sides, and the referee
didn’t really seem to be in full con-
trol of the game at points.

But it was a typical Albany-
Potsdam confrontation.

Bears with the lead they needed,
and a 71-70 win over the Danes.
“We had all our opportunities,"
said an upset Albany basketball
coach Dick Sauers. “We had
everything going our way. We
couldn't make the big play. We had
our own destiny in our own hands.

But it might have been a matter
of making the small plays, hitting
the free throws and controlling the
ball when they had to. that led
Albany's 1055. Leading 53-48. with
just over four ntinutes to go in
regulation. the Danes had three
chances at the foul line. yet could
only get one point. Every time
Albany missed. Potsdam capitaliz-
ed. Senior forward Pete Stanish hit
one of two shots to give Albany a
six point bulge (54-48). but center
John Dieckelman missed the front
end of a onc-and-one. Bear All-
American Derrick Rowland banked
one in. cutting the lead to four with
3:10 remaining.

Potsdarrr got within two on a

and finally tied it up on Marrricc

Albany went into their delay.

in the waning moments of a game
where his Danes are either tied for
the lead. or have it. Sauers has them
hold for the last shot — guarantee-
ing them at least a tie. and forcing
an overtirrte.

it almost didn‘t work. This time,
sopltonrorc Mike Gatto drove the
baseline at the buzzer. but was call-
ed for charging into defender
Wayne Rhodes. who went to the
foul line with no time on the clock
and a chance to end the game just
by hitting the free throw. He didn‘t.

Albany. after stalling for 3:24 in
the first overtime. had three
chances to win in the final 12
seconds, but didn't. Stanish missed
a jumper from the corner off the
rim. Dicckelrnan tapped to guard
Rob Clune. whose off target banker
fell into Steve Low's hands. But the
forward could not get the shot off.

tra period tied. 56-56.

Bears got their five point lead, and
the ballgamc.

"One thing about our team,"
said Potsdam basketball coach
Jerry Welsh. "is that we won’t give
up: We've been in so many pressure
games. Our kids play best under
pressure. When we had to run our
offense late. we ran it."

for rnost'of the game. keeping the
pace slow. and chewing time off the
clock every time they had the ball.
But when Potsdam was able to
utilize their running style of of-
fense. they were able to go ahead.
“Our game plan was to fast break
at every opportunity." said .iachirn.
the Bears' floor general.

“We were just trying to be pa-
tiertt — get a slow tempo game."
Saucrs said. I‘Tlrey didn't want a
slow tempo game.”

Potsdam got what they wanted
towards the end of the first half.
With Albany holding on to a slim
19-17 advantage. the Bears rccled
off fivc unanswered points. and led
at the half. 30-26.

The see-saw first period also had
seven tics and seven lead changes.
with the biggest difference being
Potsdam’s four point halftime rid-
vantage. 1n the second half. the
Bettrs were tip by as much as eight.
36-28. btrt Albany chipped away.
and went ahead on co-captain Ray
Ccsarc’s jump shot. 45-44. with
9:31 to go.

“We had the game won twice —
just holding the ball and making
some fottl shots." Saucrs con-
tinued. “it was a game that both
teams deserved to lose. We've got
to learn ortr lesson and make it pay
off in Binghnmton."

“Cruising ” Brings Sharp Protest

by Sylvia Saunders

Despite protests by SUNYA's
(irry and Lesbian Allitrtrcc. Albrrny
Strrtc (‘iticmu (ASC) President Mike
l-‘ricd says the movie Cruising will
be shown its sclicdulcd this
weekend.

"i will not back dowrt to
prcssurc." Fried said. “or trllow my
group to be censored. A tnovic is a
movie. i won‘t pull it otrt whether
it's offensive or not."

“Cruising offends the gay and
lesbian community." according to

Allitrncc President Mike Mcl’urllin.

According to n flycr which will be
distributed outside tltc showing of
the rrtovic. it connects violence and
perversion with homosexuality.

in addition to distribution infor-
mational slrccts. Mci’rrrtlin said his
group will offer an alternative
showing of the movie Word Is Oul.
a “documentary which gives an
honest look at homosexual life.“

Fried said he welcomes the
distribution of pamphlets and arty
alternative showings. but will not

change his mind about presenting
the movie as scheduled.

"No movies cart be banned on
this campus," he said. “That wot id
set a terrible precedent. Then any
one group on campus who found a
movie offensive would expect its to
withdraw it. We're a business. We
have to show it."

members. “We're hoping that will
