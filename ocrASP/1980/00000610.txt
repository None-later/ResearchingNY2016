Practicality is the New Yule Rule

by Sue Smith

[I used to be easy to pick out the
ideal Christmas gift for a woman.
With tltc rise of the Career-oriented
woman of the 80’s, this holiday
season finds lllcll torn between
traditional and nonconforming gift—
givirtg.

Store clerks irr Macy‘s women's
clothing department said most rrren
have been combing through the
designer jean racks. At Herman's
Sporting Goods, men are tneasttring
skis. Hershburg Jewelers see men
paying great sums for solid gold
chains and the Book House store
manager has observed men biting
their nails as they leaf through art
and cookbooks for their favorite

women.

Other big sellers this season in-
clude hot red garter belts, three-
piece suits. plush blue fox fur coats,
designer jeans, hiking boots,
microwave ovens, velveteen jackets,
and gold chains.

"The ads point to utility this
year," according to SUNYA
Marketing Professor Roy A.
Klages. “Men are buying rrrore
practical things. However,
Christmas carries a great deal of
sentimentality — it carries the ‘wcll,
it comes once a year' attitudes in
it."

“Men cotnc in here wondering
what the lteil to get their wives and
girlfriends," said the Herman Spor-

ting Goods manager. "More than
ever this year rrten are buying rue-
quets and skis and ski jackets as
gifts. Sales are going up every year.
We even ltave a night when we . . .
open it (the store) specifically for
men so they have a comfortable
shopping atmosphere arid can ex-
change ideas amongst themselves."

According to numerous other
sporting goods stores, women are
becoming more physically active
and sales in sports equipment are
sky rocketing.

The B. Forman Women‘s
Clothing department manager said
she has observed, “Men are buying
more practical things for the work-
ing woman. There is less frilly ap-

parcl out now for the woman. it's

Women's apparel store clerks say
that sales have increased for prac-

tical items such as bras and panties,
suits, jeans, sweaters. and ﬂannel
pajamas. Says Casual Corner store
clerk, “Most men are buying big
items: coals, suits, and sweaters. A
lot of suits are selling so women can
wear them to work or dress them
up. They're buying big items
because they don't want to take
time to match outfits. i really think
males are the rrrost fun to wait on."

The SUNYA Women's Studies
Department Professor Christine
llosc attributes the increase in prac-
tical buyitrg to financial constraints.
“In this tight ecorrorrry, don't give
me the fluff," slre quips, wearing
beige corduroy Levis ltersclf. "Tile
practical trends in btrying are a
result of inflation. We can't change
these trctrds. Three-piece suits make
rrtorc sense now."

Albert's Hosiery store manager.
however, has a different view:
"(latter bell stiles are up higher
than c\cr this year,“ A glance over
at the display shows a laccy hot red
garter bclt seductively adorning two
slender mannequin legs.

Sibley's Lingerie manager ex-
plained the psychology behind
seductch salcs. “Men try to buy
their wives arid girlfriends
something they cart visualilc them
in. They‘re coming otrt with tttore
color tlratr ever this year, and at one
time a llltlll would never think of
buying partly scts, bill now they
do. they‘re a nice thing to open
trrtdcr the tree.

(iold jewelry, especially diarrrond
pendants and gold neck chains, are
also poptrlar gift items for women
this year, claim several jewelers. "i
guess it means prestige to wear
them.“ said lalcs .leuclcr'. Klages
addctl, “if people have a little
money, jewelry is it good place to
invest it.”

Klagcs did not feel that furs are a
wise purchase for inveslrrrcrtt
reasons becattsc there‘s no tur-
nover. “You can't sell them back
like sil\crware." 'l‘ltc Macy's fur
department manager contends.
however, that furs are still a big
Christmas itcrrr for rrrert shopping
for women of all ages.

“Sales are way tip," he said.
“Women want them because they
feel pretty itt them."

The luxury of fur, ranging from a
short-hooded rabbit ftrr coal priced
at $299 to a long bltre fox coat pric-
ed at $3599 is "practical," the
manager added. “because it's
warm."

Men who cannot afford to bli'/
fur cram into stationery and knicl.»
knack shops, the most crowded
stores this season. The Schatz's Sta-
tionery Store display near tlte
plastic«rrroided Adam arid Eve
toothbrushes are already bare.
Pickled l’coplc preserves line the
shelves for men who ltave
girlfriends witlt a sense of ltttrrror.
