Sean Lennon
The Dakota Hotel
New York. New York

Dear Sean.

i'm hoping that someday these words
will help you understand. You don't
know me. but l knew our father. This
isn't going to be easy. ou know how
sometimes people have something real-
ly important to say and they get all
choked up and don't make any sense?

You look outside your hotel window
and thousands of people are lighting to
keep their candles from fading out.
Their lighting to keep from crying.
They're singing "Give Peace a
Chance." i'm not sure this letter will be
of any help to you now. but it might be
in ten years or so. Keep it somewhere
safe. Sean. When you walk the streets.
people may point and whisper. Others
will pull you aside to tell you they're
sorry. Some will try to follow you for the
rest of your life. But Mummy will protect
you from those types.

"Took a walk down the street
Tlrru the heat whispered trees
[thought I could hear (hear.hear.hear)
Somebody call out my name
as it started to rain"

You see. your lather had lots of
friends. Millions of 'em. Just as he loved
you. and you loved him as a father. so
did we. We'll always loVe him. Some of
us love him more than we love
ourselves. He was our daddy. too. l
know that's not the easiest thing for you
to understand.

John never played much Beatles
music for you around the house. He
couldn't. He couldn't listen to it himself.
He'd grown up and was into a whole
new head. But we never stopped listen-
ing to the Beatles. We never will. Many
of us learned to walk. step by step. with
them. We got more complicated and'
politically astute as they did. year alter
year. Your lather loved rock ‘n' roll
music. He loved the energy it had to of»-
fer. the emotional vacuum it could fill
He was a rocker. A real God damn
rocker. '

“Everybody says we must do this and
that but our thing is just rocking. the
usual gig. "

John Lennon could rock. He could

 

apply incredible energy to old songs like
“Dizzy Miss Lizxy” or “Ain't That a
Shame." No strain of musrc was beyond
his capabilities. intensity. complexity.
hot jams. simple love songs. peaceful
ballads. angry songs of pain and isola~
tion. You've probably never even heard
"imagine."

We were hypnotized by his
poems:"Fol/ow her down to u bridge
by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
eat niurslrnrollow pies.
liueryone smiles as you
drift post the flowers
that grow so incredibly high"

He was always alraid that we were
reading too much into evurything he
did. He tried to simplify everything for
us. Just four chaps writing some songs
and having a jolly good time. But we
had to enlarge everything. Every song
had to haVe larger meanings of life or
death.

"I write lyrics —— yott don't realize
what they mean until later. "

“Oh no." we said. "Give its themes.

underlying messages. Paul's the walrus.
right?" Every bowel movement was big
news. We never left him alone. Selfish?
Us. get selfish about John Lennon and
the Beatles?
‘ We didn't approve of his dating your
Mummy. So we gave him hell. We
punished little Johnny. We blamed her
for every bloody thing. Yoko was the
reason the Beatles split up. No question
about it. She did it. All that weird
Japanese artsylartsy crap. We blamed
her when your folks had a “Bed—in for
Peace." They had their honeymoon in
bed  and we televised it. Like Monday
night football. Yoko's laiilt. Also her
fault. when she forced John to appear
naked with her on the cover of linfinish»
ed Music "I  ’l'riio Virgins We called
her sortie ol the nastiest names. And
why not, The Beatles Wtiltltl have
played‘til they were ()4. right?

What a load of bullshit John Lennon
lived with pain. frustration. and
loneliness. Your grandfather left your
family before yotu dad was born. Your
grandmother. Julia. sent little Johnny
over to his aunt. to be raised. Julia was
killed by a drunken driver. He kept all oi
this inside. Sean. Let it bubble arid boil.
it exploded with the Plastic Ono Band.

"Mother, you had me.

Your Mummy is the reason he sinw.‘

pulled through. Got his tilt
together."You better get _Uittti'.i‘ll

Pretty soon you're gonna be tlt'tltl
What on earth you trying to do
it's up to you. yeah you."

It was a joint venture. little Sean He
explained it. “Anybody who claims to
have .sorne interest in me as an ill
dividual artist or even as part of tlri'
Beatles has absolutely misunderstood
everything l ever said if they can't see
why I'm with Yoko. And it they can't
see that. they can't see anything
They're just jacking off to —— it could he
anybody."

it all makes so much sense now N at
we understand. What fools we were

He cared about us. didn't he? Was he
that pissed off at us? Nair. we knew he
loved us. We could feel it in his \ioii'i'
That voice. When it wasn't smooth and
earthy. it was bluesy and gutsy. But it

the 60's. kid. And John Lennon didn't
compromise. He did what he thought
was right. A major campaign for peace
He hated violence. Stop the war 7 but
if you're going to be violent. “you can
court! me out. " It was a silly war. Sean.
You see. there were these adults who
thought — aw. forget it.

What i'm trying to say is that your
lather had balls. He didn't play
anybody's games. He toyed with the
games. Oh. he could have churned out
those discs like Paul did. Why? Because
that's what you're supposed to do. John
Lennon wasn't finding rock ‘n' roll exs
citing. You know that. So he went
home. Withdrawal with honor (Told
turkey. How many other musicians got
out when they should have? Do you
know anybody who's seen Van Mor-
rison in concert recently'ﬂiow many
times can you sing “Moondance?”

What about Bob Dylan? Your lather

John Lennon went home. Sean
Home to Mummy. Home to you. lie

been socially rammed down his guilt-t
lle altered his lifestyle. How many men
would sit home and raise their son and
cook and clean every day? Oh. he
could afford it. but that's not the point
The point is that he shed the macho
man psyche — the “my wife will never
\vork" bullshit.

"When l was cleaning the cut shit and
feeding Sean. she urns sitting tIt ioonis

With all of his incredible wit. his mini-

Sean. your lather stopped Working
for us. He started Working for you and
your Mummy. We couldn't corn
prehend that. Didn't want to hear what

If we were hostile about it. Sean. we
never for a second meant to be. ereu

out of this country. we fough' to keep

weren't going to sit around and let him
throw out the iriaii who tang. "let me
take you to Strawberry Fields." The
iriari who took rock 'n' roll and forced it
through the umbilical cord giving it a
newer. fresher meaning. The irrarr who
threw his medals hack to the Queen.

Nobody was going to let him slip out

You stayed here. Sean. and we were
such great hosts. weren't we? Kept you

like that stuff. right. pal? Yeah. We

Sean? ’l'here are no real explanations
for what went down.

Some asshole thought he was (ltrtl
and exercised the power to decide who

day in that Apple ('an't explain it, Your
father came back to tell what he'd been
doing for five years He gave us another
album. and once again spoke from the
heart

"I'm inst sitting llt’l't'

avoided the traps that so iriany others
fell for who understood that to survive.
you had to take care oi yoursell. This is

lAn Open Letter To The Son Of A Islet, A Composer, And A Loving Man

the man who was shot to death. By a
Beatles lair. What manure. John Len»
non wasn't a Beatle anymore. He was
John Lennon. father of Sean Lennon.
"I'm scored. I'm scared.
l'iri scared
livery day of my, life
Ijust manage to .sttt‘uitte
ljust wanna stay alive
Hatred and jealousy.

Gonna be the death of me
lgiiess i knew it right from the start
Sing out about forte and peace
Don't wanna see the red. raw meat
The gi'eeii-t.'yed goddamn
Straight from your heart
l'ni tired n] being so alone"

Sean. i hope I have given you some
indication of our love for your daddy.
He is gone. and we're hurt. We're.
upset. we're angry. Oh. man. are we
hurt. We'll cry for a long. long time. He
wouldn't have wanted us to get violent.
Nor to glorily him because of his death.
Let it be.

You're only live now. Sean. Some of
the older people are going to try and
make lots of money from his being
dead. it isn't right. But it's happening
already. lt's Christmas time. and they'll
milk him like a big, fat l'lolstein. We're
not going to give in to any of that
shit.'Cause we know how he felt about
Christmas.

"I know this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The irear arid the dear one
The old and the young
And. so this is Christmas.
For weak and [or strong
For rich and [or poor ones
The world is so wrong
And so. happy (.‘lrristinas
Let's hope it's ti good one
Without any fear"

You try and enjoy your Christmas
liaddy wouldn't want you to miss it.
()h. Sean. we're going to miss him.
liverything about him. And remember.
when we follow you around and point
and say we're sorry. don't give us the
finger. Because we really are sorry. arid
you will be our friend.

All our love
