Alcohol Policy Deters Vandals

improvements and want to keep
things intact." he said.

He also feels that the Residence
Hall improvement Programs
(R.H.I.P.) has helped. Hc cont-
ntcittcd. "Out of 50 or more project
sites. only one has been vandaliz-
ed." The r- 'vrnm consists of pro-

jccts. such as murals painted on

lounge walls, that improve the
quttd‘s appearance. It creates an en-
vironmcnt thrit. hopefully. the
residents will want to protcct."

Chiplock also mentioned that the
revised alcohol policy has bccn a
help. He does not l‘ccl. however.
that alcohol is the main causc of tire
problem.

There were also some comments
from Colonial Quad rcsidcnts. Ran-
di Simon. a sophontorc living in a
Iowrisc. said. “it's obviously a pro-
blem. I don't think it can bc stop-
ped completely. but if offenders
who are caught get more severe
punishments. maybe they‘ll think
twice about doing. it again." Site
also noted that the problcm is not
mttch different front the ouc that
existed last year witcn she lived on
State Quad.

Regina DcNunrio. also a
sophomore living in a lowrisc corn-
mcntcd. “I lived in a Iowrisc on
State last year and there’s definitely
more vandalism here. i think it
deals with a rcputation that some
people who live here feel Colonial
has."

indian Quad Coordinator. Tom
Gcbhardt. explained that when an

incident occurs. he follows a
routinc procdurc. "A van-
dalism/damage report form is

fillout. Then a dircclor or Frank
Hoban. the supervising janitor.
files a damage report. This is passed
on to the director of” tire building
where the incidcnt occurred. He or
she trics to follow up on how the in-
cidcnt happened. This is donc
through tltc RA‘s through discus-
sions with students. and Vii! postcr.
(lndlan has already initiutcd
baxicttlly the same poster project
the Colonial is going to us)."

situation need a lot of emotional
support form others. “The biggest
problem. especially if the girl
chooses to have an abortion. Is the
psychological factor. They need a
lot of support in order to be more
emotionally able to deal with it."

McClintock agreed, saying,
“Some form of verbal support
helps the girls to be calmer. and‘
more able to deal with the guilt ln-
volvcd. They want to speak to so-
meone. to clarify the situation for
themselves. and to run it by a third
party who's not a member of the
family. so there's no heavy emotion
or guilt involved." '

Rob Reindl of Planned Paren-
titood said the hardest part for girls
faced with an unwanted pregnancy
is sorting out their feelings and
dealing with them constructively.
"Most of the girls i see know they
on: prcgnant already; they‘ve had
some signs. Most of them feel anger
zit themselves. at the boy. at the
birth control that they didn't use or
that didn't work.” Rcindl said.

"i‘ll be morc cautious in the
