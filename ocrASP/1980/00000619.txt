Steel Curtain:

End of an Era?

(Al’) Art Rooney's Pittsburgh
SlL‘CiL‘t'S, the National Football
League's most dominant learn of
the l97tts. arr: about to become just
another lcarn once more.

Not sincc I973 have lhcy been
anything brrt division champions.
Not since l97l. tltc year before they
won tltcit' first title of any kind.
ltavc they lost as many gturrcs as the
six tltcy've lost this year.

And for the patriarch ot lltL‘
Stcclcrs. c\cry orlc of those itlsst's
this year has bccn as painful as the
hundreds his boys absorbed front
the |‘)J(ls to the I')(ti)s. His is. after
all. a winner.

It would bc tricc. ltc tnttsctl. tl~
parity. that long-dcsircrl goal of
NH. ('ortunissronct l’ctc Ro/cllc,
was finally hcittg rcachcd, \vhcrcin
iusl about ctcty tcatrt Ill tltc lcrrguc
had a chance to rnak the playoffs.
“I guess. irr lltc rut-t ‘ picltrr'c. llltll
wotrld bc hcsl, ir' ctcr'ybrrtly to
lunc tr cltancc.“

Not that thc .tcclcrs are giving
the (‘lcvelrtnrl llrowns. or lloltston
()ilcrs or somebody clsc ll cltrtncc
willingly. “We're rtot doing this by
design," he said. “But I lltirtk the
teams. the best arid the worst. arc
gctting closer together."

And Rooney. who never lost
faith irt each of those long. lottg
seasons. when even tttcdiocrity
seemed like something beyond the
Stcclcrs' rcaclr. hasn't lost faith that
tIrcy‘ll gcl that fifth championship
ring, that “out- for the thumb.“

“I still think right now that we're
on our way to the Super Bowl. liven
with all our injuries. \vc'rc capable
of getting there. Unfortunately. we
nccd help. Other than winning otrr
last two games. it‘s out of our
hands. Ilut we still plan to win tltosc
lwo."
