NEW YORK (AP)Florida State is

Tire Associated Press poll. but
Coach Bobby Bowdcn says the
Seminoles will need some help from
Oklahoma to,wln their Orange

Oklahoma.

“If they don‘t make mistakes. I

Fumbling is something
Oklahoma did as “well” as anyone
until mid-season. when the Sooners
suddenly found the handle on the
football. After fumbling 33 times in
their ﬁrst ﬁve games and losing 18
of them. they coughed up the ball
only to times itt tltc final six con-

’tcsts and turned it over just eight

times.

Accordingly. their wishbone at-

tack. run by Watts. perked up so
tuttch that llowdcn refers to the
standard triple option as a
“quadruple option."
“They takc thc ll‘iltlL‘ option ottc
