team trampled New Paitz, 66-33.
“Our goal was to hit 60 points and
we surpassed it. scoring 66."

ball coach Chris Behrens happily
noted.

The key was their man-to-man
defense. With the score a close 12-8.
and Albany ahead with 9:05 left in
the ﬁrst half, the Danes switched
from the zone to a man-to-man
defense. New Paltz. unable to gear
their offense to the switch. made
numerous turnovers and had forced
many shots. The Danes broke the

game open and ended the half
3040. Most of the scoring came
from Albany's top trio —- Carol
Wallace. who had a career high 16
points. Lynne Burton and Nancy
Halloran. who had 10 and 12
points. respectively. “Carol
Wallace played an outstanding
game. the best we have ever seen her
play.” commented Albany head
coach Amy Kidder.

The fast break was working
alnrost to perfection for the Danes.
Rebound after rebound was prliled
down and the women constantly hit
the free man down court. Hallorrln
had l2 rebounds leading the attack.
“Nancy excelled off the boards
tonight." said Kidder.

Jackie Golden proved to be an
unexpected brigllt spot for the
Danes. colning off the bench to
play excellent defense. score six
points rlnd hand out three ' ts.

Albany's next game will he
tonight against a tough Potsdam
learn — only adding to the intense
Potsdam-Albany rivalry. The
Bears are quick and depend mainly
on their fast guards and fast breaks.
“To beat them we will have to play
very light defense." forccasted Kid-
der. “They do not have much
height. bllt are extremely quick. We
are going to have to slow down their
attack allLI lllake them set up on of—
fense. Then we will have to play
good ball."
