Use of Tie-Lines Restricted

 

‘ [Charges to be Itemized

by Nora Kirby

El't‘ective last month, all trott-
statc agencies rrrtrst pay for tire trse
ol‘ university tie-lines. according to
SUNYA (‘ontnrunicatious Coor-
dinator Pat Auricchio.

Aur'iccltio explained this actiort is
not disciplinary or discriminating
btrt necessary for the economic stir»
\i\’ttl of tire university. He said tlte
university “has to prepare itself for
the day when tie-line charges will he
itcrtri/ed.”

The university now pays a flat
rate ol‘ $2.400 monthly to the ()t'l‘ice
ot~ General Services (00$) for the
use oi~ the lines. Auriechio said.

SA Vice-President litialt l.ct_\u

lety said the tit) student groups

do a great deal for the eortrntunity
and “it is about time we got some
support from this administration."
He does not think that SA should
have to pay the $300 charge for the
yearly use of its two tie-litres.
Attricehin explained the only
alternative in billing SA would be

the removal of their tieelines corn-
pletely.

Attriechio said he has tirade
ntunberous changes iri_art attcrtrpt
to cut back on expenses. The
number or Uni\'er.sit_\'-wide tic-lines
has been reduced front 900 to 200,
and the hours that the lines are
available have been cut to weekdays
