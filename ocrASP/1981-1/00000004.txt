:I UASPlanS Renovations

 

Aims for Better Food Service

by Frank 011

To “improve customer service
and increase sales,” University
Auxiliary Services (UAS) is plann-
ing to renovate the Campus Center
cafeteria and the Rathskellar snack
bar this summer, according to UAS
manager E. Norbert Zahm.

The main objective for the
c_afeteria would be remodeling the
eating areas in a sectionalized
fashion. improving the lighting.
putting in new furniture, and
developing. a pew traffic pattern for
easy customer movement." Zahn
said.

Zahn plans to renovate the snack
bar to make better use of the space,
and to make it more attractive and
energy efficient.

"The main probletn will) the
snack bar is that in order to provide
the quickest service possible a fast
food trrentr. like McDonaldr would
have to be implemented. But this is
not wanted. We are losing sales
because we can't get people through
quickly enough. Inrt we feel serving
fIr.~.t food would not he the

answer."

Zahn cxplalned."Cashicrs can-
not bc linked with the food handlers
due to health regulations. ’UAS.
unlike a McDonalds. does not Irave
its food pro—wrapped. which
enables their cashiers to handle the
food.”

University approval is needed for
the renovation, but Zahn fcols any
reasonable plan will be approved.

Oswego State May Lose Lab

by Wayne Peerelioom .

The Oswego State campus schoo
laboratory may be eliminated due
to cuts in that college’s budget. ac-
cording to Oswego State Provost
Ralph Spencer.

Spencer said he proposed to close
the lab in response to Governor
Hugh L. Carey's 1981-82 budget.
which calls for the elimination of 26
positions at Oswego State. Spencer

UAS will pay for the renovatio. 5.
although both the snack bar and
Campus Center cafeteria are on
state owned property.

Zahn plans to first remodel the
cafeteria during the month of June.
and the snack bar during the re
mainder of the summer. “If we
closed both services at the satnc
time. we would lose too much
money." Zahn said.

Zalrn added that students are

proposed rcnmations.

said the school. which has just
under 300 nursery through sixth
grade public school students, “is
what we‘d call an auxiliary enter-
prise." According. to Spencer. 20
positions would be dropped if the
school were eliminated.

Spencer noted. however. that his
proposal tnttst be approved by the
SUNY Central administration
before the school could he closed.

The 1972 documentary concert
ﬁlm “Pink Floyd at Pompeii" is
the latest rock film to be released on

sidiary has purchased the rights to
the film. and the company reports

 

the movie will be released on video
disc later this year.

The disc will include not only
footage of Pink Floyd performing
among the ruins of Pompeii. but
also ﬁlmed sequences of the group
in the studio as they recorded their
big-selling album. "Dark Side of
the Moon.”

RCA says his Pink Floyd film
should be perfect for the home

video market because it has become

a “cult” film in recent years.

' rain drops keep . . .

. .lI

Acid rain is causing a growing rift
between Canada and the United
States.

When sulphur dioxide from coal-
fired power stations and industrial
complexes mixes with atmospheric
moisture, the result is sulphuric
acid. which eventually falls to the
earth as “acid rain."

According to New Scienlisl
Magazine. the U.S. sends six
[trillions tons of sulphur dioxide in-
to Canada every year, and as a
result. hundreds of lakes in Ontario
are already “dead” — that is. fish
life cannot be sustained —— and
48,000 other lakes are at risk.

John Roberts, Canada’s Minister
of State for Science and
Technology. told a recent meeting
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. "We are
frustrated in our efforts in Canada
(to control acid rain) by the simple
fact that at least halfof the problem

The two countries are currently
negotiating a formal treaty for con-
trolling the sulphur dioxide pollu-
tion, which is expected to be com-
pleted in 1982.

Meanwhile. Canadians are par-
ticularly worried. New Scientist
says. that President Carter's Ad-
ministration will launch energy pro-
jects based on coal and will water
down the Clean Air Act. That
legislation, which controls emis-
sions of the pollutant. comes up for
reauthorization this year.

. Legislation introduced in the last
Congressional session. and likely to
be passed under the recently con-
vened 97th Congress. could result in
a crackdown on sources who release
information deemed to be a threat
to national security.

Two bills. introduced in both the
House and the Senate. and known
collectively as the “Intelligence
Identities Protection Act." would.
in effect. make releasing. the names
of known intelligence agents a
crime.

The Progressive Mugarine
reports that the legislation, if pass»
ed, would amount to an American
version of Britain's “Official
Secrets Act." That legislation was
passed during. what The Progressive
calls the “Spy Fever" era in 1911.

if passed, the U.S. legislation
would outlaw the identification of
intelligence agents, and could also
be used to impose criminal penalties
for publishing information that
might help in such an identification.

According to The Progressive.
the act would specifically target The

Bulletin, a Washington-based
publication which identiﬁes CIA
agents in each issue. The

Tire Progressive says that. if pass-
ed. the legislation would allow the
U.S. government to classify
intelligence-related information
from its inception without going
through any legal process to deter-
tnine what should or should not be
censored.

That old saying "You are what
you car" has been changed: now.
you are how you eat.

Tltttt's because recent studies
httyt: found what you eat. how you
eat it and how you react to it can
tetctrl secrets nt your personality.

For example. scientists at Cam-
bridge University have found that
introverts can easily be distinguish-
cd from cxtroverts by the way they
respond to a few drops of lemon
juice. lntroverts reportedly release
more saliva titan outgoing people.

 

And psychological research at the
State University of New York and
tire University of Texas has shown
that people who enjoy eating lend
to be assertive. energetic, sociable
anti affectionate. while those who
don‘t eat with gusto have a nearly
'opposite type of personality.

Industrial psychologists in Lon-
don. tncanwhile. say your candy
eating habits are an instant
gheuwa) to personality traits.
They found that people who sucked
their candy are the most emotional-
ly stable. while the candy chewcrs
were cheerful and optimistic. but
lacking itr discipline.

Pigeons in Washington, D.C.,
may be the first victims of President
Ronald Reagan‘s efforts to clean up
government. ..

The General Services Administra-
tion is reportedly planning to
launch an all-out war against
pidgeons in the nation’s capital by
setting poisoned traps on ten
federal buildings.

The G.S.A. Plan calls for box
traps to be scattered on rooftops
throughout the federal triangle.
Trapped birds will then be poisoned
with a substance like carbon
monoxide or chloroform. Other
ideas include the possibility of ac-
tiving electric'wires to hot-foot the
birds.

Commented one wildlife lob-
byist, “If the start of this Wild

:West Administration is to be ac-
companied by the mass extermina-
tion of urban wildlife. then we can
expect the dcrelicts of the city to be
next."
