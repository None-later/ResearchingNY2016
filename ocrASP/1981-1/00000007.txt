r; the spring of 1980, l dropped
j out of high school in the last

month of my senior year. Don't
get me wrong — l ioVed school. and
kept going right up until the last day.
School had. long been to me a wonder-
ful social club where you went to meet
people, enjoy classes and engage in the

brilliant and pointed arguments that
David Diamond

tackled such intriguing questions as “if a
tree falls in an empty forest, who gives a

 

I shit?" or “if Mark Twain was so great.

,how come he never wrote Moby Dick?"

lurth in The New Yorker?

But i had reconciled myself long ago
to the fact that i'd never meet the
minimum requirements to graduate.
Somewhere along the line i had forgot-
ten a few things while carrying on my
urbane and witty repartee ~ mainly.
dosses. it stems from an organizational
problem i had. and from the unrlerstatr
ding that it seemed silly to wake up ear-
iy. get dressed. eat breakfast. and walk
to school when i'd only fall back asleep
by the first period. Why not make
everyone happy by staying home?

My plan was to follow in the literary
footsteps of Kerouac. Steinbeck and
Gunther. and to become a wandering
vagabond — not realizing. of course.
mat the days when you could go to a
Salvation Army store. buy a complete
wardrobe for 35 cents. and work off a
meal by washing dishes out back were
long past. A fatigue shirt at the best East
Side surplus store is cheap at $2.00.
and you have to be union to even rinse
a dish.

So i decided on the' next best thing:
joining the United States Air Force
under their delayed entry program.
They'd give a high school drop-out a
physical. basic training at Lackland Air
Force Base near San Antonio. Texas»
four months to report. and the fatigues.
were free.

At home. the decision was met with
amazement. People like me never join

the Air Force, 1 was told. i'd been a
member in good standing of the high
school intelligentsia. and had never
acknowledged or accepted authority
from anyone (teachers. parents. cross-
ing guards, etc.). Nor was i particularly
neat and clean. l'm someone who
couldn't wait to shave just so i could go
around unshaven. And my father affec-
tionately and poetically termed my
room "the shit palace."

But i figured. if I couldn't adapt to dif-
ferent situations. it would be burger-
frylng at McDonald's the rest of my life.
The Air Force would give me four years
to decide what to do with my life. a nice
chunk of money. a bit of worldiness and
all sorts of experiences.

At 7:30 in the morning of Tuesday.
November 18. at Fort Hamilton.
Brooklyn, New York. l swore in as a
trainee In the USAF.

Our gang quickly spread out and
made friends. though i thought it would
be more fascinating to go around and
monitor the conversations of people
from all over our land. For once, i was
wrong. Conversation was limited to ac-
counts of “how fucked-up" they each
got on the plane. Either they were exag-
gerating. or i slept clean through the
bong hits in the aisles. the gang-raping
of the stewardess. and the. hijacking of

 

the plane to Miami.

i grew bored with eavesdropping. sat
down. and with a pretentious flourish.
took Kafka's The Penal Colony out of
my duffel bag. Soon a guy who must
have been a regular on The Andy Gril-
Ii'th Show came by and asked.
“Whatcha readin'?"

i told him it was a novella in which a
man awakens to find himself transform-
ed into a huge cockroach. l was about
to explain the allegorical implications
and man's alienation. when he said.
“Oh. it's like a fairy tale. huh?” i could
have cried.

But i had no time, Just then this very-
tall person walked in and urged us to
“Shutup.” He wasn't at all pleased with
the response. and screamed.“NOW
SHUT THE HELL UP!" We did. and
the tall man. who was a tall sergeant.
launched into a tirade: “You are now
in the US. Air Force. and from this mo-
ment on. just about everything you do
from now on counts against you. The
first person i see talking is gonna wish
he joined the Army." (Air Force people
treat the Army with the same amount of
respect a New Yorker does Jersey.)

“Now march out to those green buses
and get on. You will not leave empty
seats. And you will not talk!"
Welcome to Lackland Air Force

Base.

The rest of that day is a blur of long
lines and endless paperwork. At night.
the weary bunch was marched out to
our new home. and told to stand by the
barracks and wait for our T.l. (Training
instructor). About half an hour later.
this tremendous object. well over 8' 5",

   
   
  

and 500 pounds. walked over and
bellowed something which we all
prudently took to mean "shut up." it
then began to pace back and forth.
looking at us while wearing the facial ex-
pression of a man walking barefoot on
animal intestines.

Suddenly the voice rang out: “i am
Staff Sergeant Russell. i am your T.l.
You are all now in the Air Force.
Childhood is over. All your lives. you
thought with .your brains. Here you will

 to

think with your ears. You’ll do nothing
until we tell you to. and when we do.
you do it immediately and correctly or
heaven help you —— and heaven is a
long way from Lackland.

“in basic training we assume you
know nothing — so we'll teach you to
march. shoot. eat. sleep. shower. ship,
and wipe your asses. Now go up those
stairs and you have five minutes to find
your name on the flight roster. and your
bed in the bunk."

Twenty minutes later all fifty of us
were still scrambling around like idiots
looking for the bulletin board which held
the list.

Later that night. we were given our
"Student Study Guide." which contain-
ed everything we'd need to get through
basic. it had chapters on everything
from chemical warfare and the Laws of
Armed Combat to Make-up and Skin
care. 5.5. Russell told us we would

carry it with us wherever we went, and
whenever we weren't doing anything
we should stand there reading it. (The
duty days ahead would allow us a
leisurely 10—15 minutes of “not doing
anything") '

Scientists wonder if 10.000 chim-
panzees typing on 10,000 typewriters
would one day come up with Hamlet's
soliloquy. The Air Force took the same
10.000 chimps and had them write the
Study Guide. it contained paragraphs

and descriptions which were totally in-
comprehensible.

Worse still were the neatness rules.
We were expected to fold our clothes in
perfect six-inch squares. and clothing
irons had to be kept shiny as new. A
single hair follicle on a razor blade
meant demerits. l'd been used to piling
dirty clothes on my floor until naked.
then piling them on my desk and star»
ting all over again. i was in big trouble.

We read for a while longer. then 5.5.
Russell gave us 15 minutes to shave.
shower and get in bed.

We were awakened the next day after
a refreshing four-hour sleep. and mar-
ched to the processing building for our
first clothing issue. They placed us in a
small room and told us to remove our
clothes.

Stripping with 99 other men in a tiny
room was an interesting experience,
You couldn't move your hand without
striking someone's private parts. And if

you dropped something on the floor.
you were much better off forgetting
about it. We were marched nude past
bins of underwear. socks and fatigues. it
might have been a scene from Dante's
Inferno — naked. tortured souls of
bargain hunters damned to eternal rum-
maging through a store containing
clothing which all looked the same and
wouldn't fit no matter how many one
tried on.

, The dreaded haircut came next. but

 
   

by that time we were so numb and ex»
hausted we didn't care. We were thrilled
to be just sitting in a chair.

Four days limped by. The processing
is an endless process. After. we were
given some news to cheer us up. Staff
Sergeant Russell was not our real T.l.
There was a new one on the way. and
she was supposed to be meaner,

Staff Sergeant Martin became our
head T.'i., assisted by 5.5. Gourunski.
5.8. Martin met us with such a mean
expression that i was almost tempted to
laugh. But if i didn't know that T.i.'s
weren't allowed to maim and kill. i
would have been terrified. One guy ad-
mitted. almost four weeks later. that he

Under 55. Martin. the days dropped
into unbreakable routine. Awake at
0500 hours. downstairs fully dressed for
reveille at 0505. breakfast after clean—up
at 0600 (the same meal every single
day). a march back to the barracks to be
told by 58. Martin now pathetic we
were. Classes came next —~ on anything
froln Air Force security. the Soviet
threat, to four hours on how to wear a
uniform. They were abysmally boring.
but falling asleep was considered an act
of treason.

A day of this. coupled with physical
conditioning. ended at lights out.
Sometimes we were given a little free
time, giving us an opportunity to shine
our boots. fold our clothes. and write an
occasional letter home.

The obsession with cleanliness was
fascinating. in a way. The major thing
you had to pass through basic training
was folding your clothes properly and

   
   

making your bed tightly. All else seem—
ed incidental. it wasn't uncommon to
see a grown man on the verge of tears
because he couldn't fit a shirt into a six
inch square.

Equally interesting Was the use of
obscenity. i'm not one to be shocked by
dirty words. but the disgusting imagina-
tion of the sergeants amazed me. For
example. while flatulence was a com-
mon affliction.-the flight (training unit)
was still shocked to hear SS. Martin
berate a man after he farted at a
meeting: “Clean our your asshole on
your own goddamn time u not mine!"
And this from someone's daughter, The
female trainees got the Worst of it. we
were told. "Girls." they were instructed.
“there's six and one half miles of dick on
this base. and you can't touch any of it,"
Or this was heard on the Dr’ii'dtlt'
ground: “When i say ‘Altention' i want
to hear fifty pussies closing
simultaneouslyl" imagine the effect that
had on a farm girl from Montana!

Back in the barracks. the trainees
were beginning to know more about
each other -» the first chance following
the hectic days of processing and orien
taiiou, The conversation ran in mm»
high school: the humor was intent on n
laugh at the expense of the few barracks
boobs (who almost enjoyed the associa-
iion). A “Dick of the Week" contest was
hailed as the greatest invention since
bottled beer And some of the men
picked up a few Yiddiin phrases. it was
common to see a black trainee from

1 Georgia demanding. "Move over, you

mother-fuckin' shiongl"

i was asked. when i came home. i
basic had changetl me. it didn't really
matter. but as much as i hate the. cliche
of the army movie «- boy becomes man
after boot camp — i did see the wise
asses and goof-offs turned into airmen.
There were exceptions. of course: one

guy put his head through a window,

because he couldn't stand shaving every
day.
“k ‘k *

Entitle this. “The Beginning .of the
End."

One month into basic, we were
assigned to K.P.. much like working for
college food service except for the
hours: 0400 (that's 4 am.) until 0830.
But we looked forward to it as a chance
to relax from the mental pressure of the
barracks. Unfortunately. working in the
dish room aggravated ‘a skin condition
on my hands. it’s been diagnosed as
eczema — overuse tends to make them
crack open and bleed. it had happened
so many times before that i didn't worry
this time.

   

But later. when l raised my hand to
request another K.P.. 8.5. Martin
screamed and told me to hurry over to
the Medical Center. There a captain ex-
amined my gnarled hand. looked con-
fused, and called in tWo other captains.
Baffled. they summoned a major. who
called in a colonel. l was left alone as
they went into the hallway to confer. My
first captain returned and apologeticaily
told me what i feared —-- i was to be
medically discharged.

it was approximately a week after i
was first told. that i was taken out of
training, But the whole week. 5.5. Mat»

ed my hand at a briefing. she'd yell.

failure to salute properly (i couldn't

she forgot that a week before i didn't

time. i was taken off duty and put on

for re-instatement were in vain. As far
as the Air Force was concerned. David
Diamond was “hands off."

* i * ,

During the flight home. all i could
think of was the waste. Of my time. yes
— but of great amounts of money as
well. The government spent thousands
of dollars on me, and all they got out of
it was a few floors swept. some dishes
washed. and some officers saluted. But
though i fault their decision to let me go
(i was going to be a translator — not a
rope climber. for Chrissake) an order is
an order.

And what did i get out of it? Well. i
can laugh at the hysterical military
discrepancies on M 'A'S'H. And know
that i gave five weeks of my life to Uncle
Sam. and he didn't want me.
