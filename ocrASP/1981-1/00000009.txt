more. when we. as pacifists. ask our nation
to disarm. or limit armaments. are we being
fair to all the non-pacifists (who have an
equal right to their belief) when we ask
them to give up their only protection? WL‘
don’t even tell them how disarmament can
be safely accomplished. We may be willing
to bc martyrs to the cause. but we are ask-
ing them to be victims of our bclicf.

The only fair and practical way to disarm
is to have a world government under con-
inIInional law with an international police
force capable of protecting all nations as
they completely disarm. Since such a policc
force would cost so litllc compared with the
present armies of the world, think of the
money saved for worlbwhilc purposes.
Grccd and lust for power may yet cmhroil
the world in a terrible armed conflict. but.
even so. let us start to teach lhc peoples of
the world that there is a better way of scttl-
ing differences by creating a world govern-
Incnl undcr constitutional law.

We counsel any women on all aspects of
pregnancy and do alert her as to what abor-
tion emails and any possible ramiﬁcations.
especially the emotional ones. she may In-
cur. If she chooses abortion, we cannot
console her In that decision. as your article
states. Since we regard mother-to-bc and
her baby equally. that would be shccr
hypocrisy.

We do tell her that our services are always
available to her in the future. Many times
this does involve a woman that ulrcady had
an abortion. She comes to us. emotionally
distraught and in need of loving support to
reaffirm that she is still a person of worth.
that she can learn from her mistakes and
direct her life with more self-esteem and
conﬁdence by choosing positive solutions
to her problems. I am well aware that your
interpretation of the quote could have been
a misunderstanding.

in these times, ofcoursc. Ihcrc is no shor-
lngc of pundits and Critics who scruIinIzc
modcrn Iit'c. Almost daily. our nation‘s soul
is .xcnrchcd; its psychc, probed; and its
anatomy. dissected as seldom before.
There is a danger that this sort of inner
scrutiny can lead us to magnify the meaning
of cvcry change and to see each passing
"IN" :15 a new tidc. I fear than if we look
morbidly into ourselves. we are likely to
sum imagining all sorts of nIIIiudics 1qu
don't exist and to despair at the human con-
dilion.
On the other hand. sclf—cxmnhunion can
be useful if it warns us ngninst complacency
and alerts us to the pitfalls of sci-dcccption.
his even more beneficial if it instructs us in
the ways of creating a better future for
ourselves and our fellow beings.
Just as It is destructive of mornlc to ig-
nmc all that has been achieved. so is it
dcluding to think that the remarkable pncc
0f progress in the postwar years could be
