Winning Form Back For J ayvees

by Marc Haspel

ONEONTA — with over a third of
the season gone by. the Albany
State junior varsity basketball team
may be returning to early season

displayed early in the season with
their two opening wins and tire
form that the Danes lost over the
next six contests. On Tuesday night,
the jayvccs dcfcatcd thc Onconta
J.V..65-53. _

The game was never really close
to begin with. Wilson Thomas’
game opening slam dunk, though
pcnalizcd with a technical. sparked
a fiery Dane offense. which for the
first time in a long while was pa
lien! and executed wcll. Thomas'
personal flame was never cx-
tinguishcd either. as be lead all
scorers with 24 points.

Albany. scoring Ii consecutive
points. jumped out to an early 13-2
lead. Realizing the futility of thc
mart-to-man defense against the
Dancs cautious offcnsc. Onconta

certainly was not enough. By
halftime. Albany held a comman-
ding 35-19 lead.

“We brought in the small guys to
try to press after the big guys piaycd
man-to-man. But our guys just do
not have a lot of experience." said
Chase.

The second half 0 play was a bit
sloppicr on the part fboth teams.
Albany lost some poise and had
trouble working offcnsivc plays.
But Onconta lost morc than poise.
the Red Dragons lost all cohesion.
Onconta committed many
fouls. cratically reaching in on the
Danes. Onconta’s big gun. formcr
varsity player Torn Pctrowski. was
in foul trouble with four personals
and had an off night. scoring only
Six points.

Billy Everett‘s basket with 5:36
left gavc tltc Dancs their third twcrt-
ty point lead of lltc game. In the
final 4:55, after a stcal and buckct
by Dragon Andy Lies. Onconta
went on to outscorc Albany. IO-(r.
But the Dancs’ wide margin was too
much too ovcrcomc as time ran out.

“Discipiiuc is important. They
outscoer us for a wltilc at the cnd.

It’s always nice to got a win on the
record. but we've got to try to
discipline ourselves,” said Albany

.l.V. basketball coach Rick Skccl.

“Everyone wc played did a good
job tonight."

Onc Dane in particular. Thomas.
continued his fine play and current-
ly is suiting up for varsity games.
After the Oncunta gantc Thomas
noted the Danes offensive poisc.

“We weren't just shooting from
the outside. The last few games
we've been shooting low pcrccn-
tagcs bill this game we shot high
percentages." said the freshman
forward.

Witilc Albany played an improv-
ed brand of tcnm ball. their opposi-
tion was not formidable. Tltc
Onconta junior varsity is a building
icam. lacking r‘cul cxpcricncc. “Wc
try to play everyone and arc
primarily cxpcrirttcntal — a tcam on
display." said Chat-3c. "Hill I‘m
lttrntart artd I'm upsct when l losc."

For Albany. lItc win was lhc first
in sct'cn trics. “We really tvantcd
this game rcai had. We had In start
with a new altitudc. Wc‘rc rcady to
play.” said Evcr‘ctt.

That six game losing streak which

time by ten points. 70-60. A few
days later. the Danes wcrc cdgcd by
