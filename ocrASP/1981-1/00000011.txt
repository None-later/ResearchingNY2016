Women’s Basketball Ends Slump

by Lori Cohen

After 'a lot of somewhat disap-
pointing play over tlte winter break.
the Albany State women‘s basket-
ball teant broke ottt of it's slump of
apathetic play in a sqttcaker' against
RPl Wednesday night at Urtiversity
Gym. Tlte women cattle tip air the
short ettd ofa 56—61 fittal score. but
staged a last minute cotneback to
make it close.

The gatrrc began on a ltigli rtote

game. iit art aggressive nian-to-rtiari

scrappy, yet very quick. Uriiotr

played a fast-priced, hustling game.
Albany was it direct contrast to the
always moving and boxing out

 

Union wonicrt. Albany executed
well. btil too slowly; tltere was little
extra movement. The Danes secured
in slow motion. Mentally, Albany
was not prepared to play. Union
had excellent shooters, rarely miss-
ing. but when they did. there were
no Albany defenders to rebound.
"We had little rebounding oii either
end of the court. Plus they had
some excellent shooters.“ com-
rttetttcd Albany women's baskclhttll
coach Atiiy Kidder.

llttrton proved the only bright
spot. as slte did the whole break.
She porrrcd in 28 points and manag-
cd to grab 18 rebounds. almost as

learn. During the last 10 minutes.

Generally. it's tough enough to win on the road. For Great Dane
basketball teams of the last tert years, it‘s been damn near impossible
to win 111 Oneorita's Red Dragon Gym. Tltc last time one did do that. it
was way back lit the 1970-71 season. Even in the Danes’ most suc-
cessful campaigns. lltere was always that one blemish. the thorn itt tltc

A typical example was just last year. Albntty led at halftime. and
conttollcd the garlic. llul ()ncotila, spurred on by their vociferous
crowd. engineered a second half rally and beat tltc Drums in overtime.
forcing them ittto a “must win" situation for the rest of the season.

school record of 2:40 in the

. ZOO-yard individual medley.

The lack of a working 1’.A.
system and the disappointing loss to
Hamilton didn't dampen the Dane
enthusiasm as they raised their
season record to 3-3-1.

The Danes have lost two
members from the team; Donna
Starace has gone to Cortland and
Jeanne Lardner has gone to
California, however, the team
ranks have been strengthened by
new team members Linr and Ming.

Binghum is pleased with the
team's progress and think they will
do equally well against New Poll:
on Saturday. The mcel will be held
in New Fall: at 2:00.
