Wednesday afternoon to return m
triumph by the score of 66-29 to

rill-3. ' ‘
Although Union did not pose

much of a threat to the visiting
Dunes “We moved some people
around and tried them in differeirt
spots," snid Albany men's swimm-
Ing coach Ron Wlirte.

The only possible hindrance the
Danes might have faced was
Union’s "odd-shaped pool. Instead
of the regulation 25-yard length,
there was an extralone foot added
which nrade the times slightly inac-
curate. We had to have a time con-
rersion factor to compensate for
the extra foot." said eritc.

Intangibles aside. the Danes had
some standout swimmers. .lrrriior'
rrnnsfcr. Neil Ullmnn pulled in two
first place finishes in the ZOO-yard
Individual Medley (2:203) and the
ZOO-yard Backstroke (2:218).

“Tlirit performance is it prime ex-
rrrriple of .loc's capricin to challenge

qualities Iic can reach down deep to
tricrcorirc ivlirrt he needs to achieve.
His pride and competitiveness tire
\ripci. He never ceases to trinrt/c me
and the thing is he really believes in
hiriiself.“tiddcd White.

 

Not to be outdone by his team-
mates, senior Kevin Ahern was ask-
ed to do triple duty. He pulled offa
hat trick. placing first in all three iii-
dividual races. He captured first in
the 50-yard Freestyle in 23.4
seconds. and completed his effort
the ZOO-yard Breast Stroke in
2134.7.

The 400-yard Freestyle Relay
featuring Albany's Shore. Dave
Motola. Larry Adolf and Kerry
Donovan was “the nrost exciting
race of the meet." White said.
"Give Kerry a lot of credit for hr-
inging back the race for us."

During the vacation the Dane
swimmers came back two weeks
early for three meets in which they
won one and lost two.
