 Intensity And Experience Provide

Difference; End 10- Year Losing Streak

by Bob Bellaflore

ONI‘DNTA -— Ray Cesare ltad
come into this town three times
before In his college career. and not
once had he left smiling. The same
holds true for Rob Clune. He lives
here. yet he has never been able to
claitn a victory here. Pete Stanish
has been here twice before as a
Dane. and twice-he has come up
empty.

As a matter-of-fact. nobody
from the Albany State basketball
team has been able to brag about a
win in Oneonta's Red Dragon Gym
since the 1970-71 season.

Until today.

Led by the seniors who had felt
the "Onconta jinx“ so often
before. an emotional and inspired
Great Dane basketball tcatn over-
came the "curse" in dominant
fashion. and trounced SUNYAC
rival Onconta. 77-58. before a stan-
ding room only crowd ltere Tuesday
night.

The Red Dragons underwent a
wholesale revamping of their pro-
grarri this seasotr. ntili/ing a crop of
freshman in an effort to rebuild.
Albany's strength is its experience.
and that was the difference.

"I was really pleased with the
wtty the seniors played,“ said
Albany head basketball coach Dick
Sauers. “1 think they played relaxed
and utider control. They (the
Dragons) were tentative. and that's
because of inexperience."

“They stepped in and were ready
to play." said ()neonta head
basketball coach Don Flewelling of
the Danes. “Wc wctc ready. too.
but with a young team, maybe just
a little too much."

Albany's confidence and ex-
perience enabled them to open up a
13 point lead at halftime (35-23)
despite Oneonta’s hustling and
crowding defense. The Dragons
kept the margin at four during ntost
of the half, but the Danes would
always seem to get the bucket when
they needed it. especially early in
the game. The only time Onconta
led was after the first basket of the
contest. and then Cesare (20 points.
game high) hit a pull-tip jump shot
and a tip-in off a fast break. and
center John Dieckelman (14 points.
six rebounds) put in a rebound to
give the Danes the lead they would
never relinquish.

“We had some key shots early in
the ganie that didn't go." said
senior Oneonta guard and ﬂoor
general Tony Saleh. That prit us
behind, and they (Albany) play well
with a lead. 1 think the first seven or
eight minutes were tlrc garlic."

The Danes controlled the tempo
as well as the rebounds throughout
the Italf. and finally ptillcd away to
their halftime lead with eight
straight points in the last three
minutes. Dieckelman hit a short
jumper. Clunc (11 points) swislicd

two free throws. and after stalling

Tltc sccotid half was all Albany.
yet there was one point where it
looked as if history would rcpcttt
itself. With the Danes ahead 51—4]
arid over nine minutes remaining.

“I thought we handled that situa-

It was Albany’s inability to do
that last year that led to their loss.
Not so this time around. Whatever
the Red Dragons threw at them. the

After four months of steady
debate between landlords and te-
nant groups. no decision has been
reached on the passage of the pro-
posed security ordinance.

The proposed security ordinance
may not be necessary. claims
Albatry Common Council Commit-
tee Chair Joseph Bucchs. who states
that the existing law can adequately
ensure secure apartments.

“There is no simple solution."
llitcchs said. "Under 2351! . tenants
who do not feel the apnrtttrcnt is
secure could call the landlords and
leave it up to the landlords to
negotiate or initiate action‘ in a
small claims court." wlrctc the
judge will decide the standard of
safety. “We don’t want to spell out

Accorditrg to Markovics. "Each
claim that goes to cotrrl is a big 'if’.
It could go either way. Because
there is no standard. they can't

Seniors Owe $3.6G in Back Dues

Markovics claims that the security
ordinance serves as a “definition of
security." and that reliance on 23513
for standards of security is inade-

Also. many tenants are either
unaware of the law‘s existence. or
do not know how to initiate legal
action against their landlords. ex-
plained SUNYA Off Campus

Reagan Calls for Aid Cuts

by~ Darbararﬁehlndlerg . . . .
“ Students receiving Basic Educa-
tional Opportunity Grants (BEOG)
or National Direct Student Loans
(NDSL) may have to look elsewhere
to finance their educations next
year if a proposal by the Reagan ad-
ministration to cut federal aid for
education is approved.

According to Secretary of Educa-
tion T.H. Bell. "this administration
is going to propose cutting back on
both BEOG and loan programs. We
don't yet know how we‘re going to
do it. but we‘re going to redtrcc the

Sweeny charged that “this is a
potential disaster."

"It's highly doubtful that other
forms of financial aid will be in-

cuts," he added.

Over 2.500.000 students receivlng
basic grants and over 2.300.000
students receiving loans will be af-
fected if the cuts become a reality.

United States Student Associa-

said the proposed cuts are “a
viscious attack on working class
students who want a decent educa-

"Money is being taken from

Sehatsky said that many people
stopped paying last year when dues

they could get away with not paying
