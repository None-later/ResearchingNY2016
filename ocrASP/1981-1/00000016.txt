year‘s record by eight minutes per
day, the association reports.

and can lead to stomach aches.

He says that high-pitched noises.
such as those given off by most ap-
pliances, react mainly with the head
— and commonly lead to
headaches.

in response to all of this, Halpern
reports he has perfected a new type
of music that has no beat or rhythm
— a sound which — in his words —
“let‘s the body choose what it
wants.”

Halpern describes his new sound
as "vitamins of the air waves which
nourish the body.” He claims that
experiments indicate that the music
promotes relaxation and can even
stimulate healing.

The name of the new group, Weir

And he insists that he will continue

working with the new group on the

bio abortions

Police in Arcata. California, are
investigating allegations published.
by a college newspaper that three
female college students underwent
illegal abortions performed in a
school marine lab by a former stu-
dent.

The ttllegations were published by
the Humboldt State University
newspaper. The Lumberjack. The
Lumberjack reporter Tom Wallace
says he was given first-hand ac-
counts of the illegal medical pro-
ccdures by the women who alleged-
ly underwent them, but only after
they stipulated that their identities
must be withheld from police and
the public.

The article alleges that the abor-
tionist had access to the laboratory
with keys, and that he used
laboratory ether and an aspirator to

. perform the operations.

Wallace says he has tried to con-
vince the women to go to the police
with their stories. but says they were
afraid to because of the publicity
and because of alleged threats.
Police on the Humboldt State cam-
pus sny they have been investigating
the reports since Christmas. but add
they ltave made little progress.
