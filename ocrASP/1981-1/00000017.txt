The China Experiment

Walter St_ry|ter

Waiter Stryker is one of theﬂrsl SUN YA
students to participate in an exchange pro-
gram with the People‘s Republic of China.
He Ls still in Peking and will remain there
until the school year ends in August.

Since first hand information by an
American student about his studying ex-

perience in the Peking’s Republic is not that -

easy to come by, I thought I’d take this op-
portunity to share with the SUNYA com-
munity my experiences as an exchange stu-
dent at Nanjing University in the People's
Republic of China.

Life here is at times- just completely op-
posite of what we know. You can only but
laugh at times at the logic of the Chinese
Value judgements have to be reserved for
individual thought afterwards. It is not re-
quested that you accept everything you set:
as your own, both is expected that an at-
tempt be made to understand. Sensitivity to
the experiences of others and their view-
point is basic to successful living in China. I
feel simply to be an academian is not
enough. it is the other qualities which has
made China a valuable personal experience.

The university is set in the center of the
city of Nanjing. It is a large city: the pro-
Vince capital. an academic center, and an
industrial and economic center. There is a
reasonable amount of social activities
available, by Chinese standards. It is a com-
fortable city. and not at all overwhelming
The transistion from Albany to Nanjing i
great, but certainly not difficult to handle

Most students live “on campus", even i
their families live in Nanjing. Foreign
students live in foreign dormitories with a
Cltinesc roommate selected from his or lter
department. A foreign roommate is
perhaps the ntost valuable tool of all in lear-
ning here. Tltey often Itave extremely
variant backgrounds, and can be anywhere
from 16 to 37 years old. Two live itt a room
that is quite large. There is hot water every
day (almost) for part of the day. electricity
most of the tirttc. and (I‘nt told) heat in the
winter. Blankets. pillows and mattresses are
provided. along with a washbasln, and hot
water thermos for drinking. Chinese dor-
mitories are less comfortable. with six to
eight in a room of similar size. electricity
only until l0 p.m., and there are no ltot
showers. The option to live in a Chinese
dormitory is excellent for learrtittg and in-
deed some of the foreign students want to
live there, htrt the administrators are hesi-

tant to allow foreigners to move there. Only
one student has succeeded. and he claims it
was with great difﬁculty

The foreign community is predominantly
from advanced nations. and the predomi-
nant language is English. In fact it is Very
easy to fall into the routine of only speaking
English. and you have to work to avoid it.
There are 80-90 students here, and the
variance of levels of understanding is wide.
The group is tight knit, however, and
everyone works together to move ahead.
There is plenty of support to be found if
things go badly or if you have a problem,
which does happen.

Academic life at Nanjing is quite dif-
ferent from SUNYA. The university has
different departments, one of which you
must select as your field of study. You are
by no means limited to the coursework of
this department. but obviously you should
have an interest in it, and be prepared to do
coursework in it. These departments are
broadly: literature. history, philosophy,
economics and foreign languages. Schedul-
ing occurs soon after arrival on an in-
dividual basis. It's very informal, and you
can go to almost any class you wish.

Attendance is important once you decide
which classes to attend, to drop or add all
you have to do is show up or not show up,
as the case may be. In addition most
students attend a “kou yu" class which is
practice in reading and speaking. They
range from easy to advanced (4 levels).
General classes are two hours long, twice a
week. Course load varies from It) to 20
hours a week depending on the person.
Whereas classes designed for foreigners are
small, 6-20 people, lecture classes may have
40-l00 students. These classes tend to be ac-
tual Chinese classes, and the level is that of
a Chinese urtiversity student. There is also
individual or small group discussion, usual-
ly arranged by the department or the pro-
fessor. The amount you cart understand
varies depending on your level and the
class.

Tray/[cling around China is undoubtedly
my most memorable experience. It is
reasonably cheap. and is by far the best way

to spcttd your money. Personal travel is'

restricted to weekends and holidays.
Weekends begin at l2 noon on Saturday
and you are supposed to be back by 7 amp.
Monday. The university provides many
free day trips, nearly one every week or

A Vital Mechanism

To the Editor:

In regard to Jack Lester's article “Call
for Coalition" I couldn't agree more with
the fundamental point that a disparity exists
between certain administrative policies and
student interests.

'However, a disturbing and potentially
damaging accusation was cited by Mr.
Lester. He is of the opinion that, “judicial
hearings violate fundamental principles of
fairness." On the contrary, Judicial Board
strictly adheres to the tenets of due process
.as outlined by our federal legal system.T.hat
is not to say Judicial Board is legal entity
but rather the point emphasizes our com-
mittment to upholding an Individual’s
rights. Furthermore, Judicial Board is com-
prised of ones‘ peers, individuals em-
pathetic towards living in a dorm situation.
Since Judicial Board is not an authoritative
body it bases its recommendations on fac-
tors that go beyond the incident itself. In
weighing a wide range of factors we give the
student a benefit above and beyond mere
innocence or guilt. Finally. our goal to
educate rather than punish certainly seems
“morally fair" to me.

In light of the fact that the SUNYA com-
munity differs in many ways from a con-
ventional community. I would suggest to
Mr. Lester the use ofa more thoughtful and
less random approach to accusations.
especially when an erroneous one could
undermine a vital mechanism within the
SUNYA commttnity.

An R.A.’s Complaint

 

 

 

To the Editor:

Currently an R.A. receives free room.
free local phone service and a $125 stipend
at the end of each semester. For this an
R.A. is expected to create and foster com-
munity within the residence halls, and to
assist students in their own personal and

social growth. This includes such activities
as counselling and implementing hall events
and programs. The R.A. also is responsible
for administrative tasks such as repair and
damage assessments. He or she attends staff
meetings, as well as a one-week orientation
before school starts. These are only some of
the responsibilities an R.A. accepts as part
of the job.

The Residence Assistance Program at
this university is one of the best in the coun-
try. It is nationally recognized and has won
many awards for its thoroughness and effi-
cieny. It is something that we should be
proud of. But for all of this the R.A. staffis
probably one of the most underpaid in the
country. It is getting to the point where the
program will suffer because quality ap-
plicants cannot afford to apply for the job.

'As it is. some R.A.'s, myself included.
have had to add outside jobs. This severely
cuts the time that an R.A. can spend with
his section. An R.A. could spend half the
amount of time per week working an out-
sidejob for twice the money. Of course, we
do get personal gratiﬁcation, but an R.A.
should get paid for what he d0es just like
anyone else. Personal reward is a luxury for
a college student trying to pttt himself
through college.

It is my hope that this proposal does not
stay in the SUNY budget for next year. If it
does i feel that many highly qualified ap-
plicants across the state will be forced to
withdraw their applications. This will mean
a loss to both the students and the universi-
ty system.

Let's inspire good applicants to apply for
this job, not drive them away. It is a job
that we cannot afford to disintcrgrate bttt it
is a position that the individual R.A. can no
longer afford to hold.

Outraged at Ad

To the Editor:

We are writing this letter to protest the
printing of a pseudo-advertisement in the
December l2, 1980 edition of tire Albany

 

 

,two, and many free movies and per-

fomances.

To travel on your own you need to plan 4
or 5 days in advance, itt order to get permis-
sion. Typical trips of this sort are to
Shanghai which is 5 hours away and other
local cities. It is wise to come to China
through Hong Kong. Not only is Hong
Kong beautiful and enjoyable. but many
cheap tape recorders, radios, cassette tapes,
books, converters (Chinese electricity is 220
volts) and film can be purchased here.

The China that the tourist sees is nothing

like the Cltina that a student secs. People
here are extremely helpful. Titerc are far
fewer problems here than at SUNYA. The
administrators are very human, and work
closely with the students. so muclt of the
footwork you would ltavc to do on your
own in Albany is done for you. (Imagine a
trip to the Financial Aids Office if you
couldn't speak English?) The atmosphere is
one of serious study, but tlterc are plenty of
other things to do. such as shoppirtg. bike
riding, talking with the other students, or
sightseeintt.

Student Press. This ad asking for a
“New-Mark on Student Association" was a
direct personal attack done in the poorest
of tastes. We are both outraged and disap-
pointed at the irresponsible actions of your
newspaper in this situation. One must
wonder; will the ASP print any article. per-
sonal. or advertisement within its pages
regardless of the potentially damaging con-
tent? We would hope to believe that such
highly offensive and distasteful material
need not be included in future editions.
And what of the individuals who chose to
place this item in the ASP? They exhibited a
rather sad lack of decency and concern for
the feelings of a fellow human being.
Perhaps the person or persons who ob-
viously had the time, effort and money for
this ridiculous endeavor could channel
these resources into something more con-
structive in the future.

anxious to find positions for their
graduating teachers, your paper may be in-
terested itt your teachers finding employ-
rttcrtt loathe following year, artd print our

8.0.8. for May day

To the Editor:

I was both shocked and appaled to see in
the ASP (January 30th) that there is a very
legitimate chance that there will be no
Mayfest this year. I am a junior and lit my
first two years I have seen that Mayfest is
the only good thing this school has to offer.

I cannot believe that students at Albany
State will allow such a thing to happen.
Although we have the reputation of being
apathetic, “I truly believe that this is one
issue when we will all stand together to figltt
whoever it takes. It may not scent impor-
tant, but Mayfest is more than a'tradition.
it is an all day event that we look forward to
after the end of winter and before the start
of finals. It is undoubtedly my ntost en-
joyable day itt Albany during the year.

Think about it, fellow students. If they
try and take away our Mayfest. we will
fight!

editorial

Why, Mr. President?

The nation‘s largest and most expensive presidential inauguration is now behind us.
The hoopla. fanfare, and huge media blitz is history. The election had provided us with
promises from then—candidate Reagan of tightening our belts, and justiﬁably so. Our
country‘s economic picture is bleak and measures of austerity must now be im-
plemented. But where do we draw the line on cutbacks?

President Reagan is now considering a proposal that calls for cutting back on federal-
ly guaranteed student loans and educational grants. Since their inception, the loans and
grants have become a necessary and important means of funding for student from mid-
dle and low income families. Nearly five million students benefit from federal aid in the
fornt of loans and grants. Over the last two years, the number of college freshmen.
receiving National Direct Student Loans (NDSL) has doubled. Clearly, there is more
need for aid now than ever before.

While it is true that family incomes are rising as inflation continues to spiral upward,
it is also true that the cost of higher education is increasing at a rate greater than that of
inflation. For many families. the burden of providing their children with college educa-
tions Itas become too great to handle alone. These federal loans and grants are vital for
the continuation of higher education. Why must some students be forced to withdraw
front school? Why must future student be dctticd the opportunity to learn? Why must a
price be put on education?

Tltc NDSL program provides eligible students with ruoncy which ntust be repayed
after graduation. The Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOG) provide
assistartce to students with financial need. The distinction, however, betwccrt grants and
loans is unimportant as both are investments in people. The returns from tltcsc in-
vesttncrtts will be seen for generations to come; a reasonable arid sound investment in
America.

Hopefully. sortie states will be able to provide sttrdcnts with increased state aid. Other
strttes may not have the necessary money to absorb the burden placed upon them by the
federal govcrment. To make matters worse, New York. ifall goes as planned by Cover-
nor Carey in his proposed fiscal I9R2 budget, will add further hardship to students by
cuttittg back on New York Ilighcr Educational Loans. If tltc federal and state
govcrmcnts tttrrt their backs on students, where will the students turn?

Prcsidcrtt Reagan and his economic advisors should recxaruinc their priorities. There
are few programs more important than education. The president docs not scent to agree
as ltc Itas also promised to climirtatc the Department of Education. Why. Mr. Presi-
dent? Why must education take a back seat to the military? Why must we pay for power
at the expense of the people? Is education not important? Surely the money can be
found somewhere in a budget of hundreds of billions of dollars.

We understand that federal spending rtutst be slashed. But why start with something
as important as education? Shouldn't we start wltcre the president suggested during his
campaign—with cuts in bureaucratic waste and inefficiency. How, with a clear cons-
cience. can we ever deny anyone the right to an education simply because of financial
need? To do so, would be just anothcr kick iii the face of tltc middle class. Education is
not a luxury to be toyed with; it is a right to which we are all ctttitled in this. the land of
equal opportunity. To lintit this opportunity would be gross and obscene.

    

 

 

 

Student Activism:

 

N.Y.P.I.R.G. In the early 1970's these
initials meant nothing. Today. however.
tens of thousands of people recognize tltcse
six letters as the abbreviation for the New
York Public Interest Research Group. Inc..
the largest statewide research and advocacy
group in tltc country

How NYPIRG began is a story well
worth retelling. During the early 1970‘s.
wltile many students retreated to the Ivory
Towers after the nturdcrs at Kent State and
Jackson State, activists used lessons learned
front the Public Interest Research Group.
Tire civil rights movement, the anti-war
movement, and the struggle for student
rigltts demonstrated that students could
mobilize their energy, ideals. and resources
to Itavc an impact upon society. Yet these
movements often lacked direction. exper-
tise. and continuity. These deficiencies
became increasingly obvious as the issues
became ntore complex.

In 1970, Ralph Nader and Donald Ross
formulated a plart which addressed the pro-
blems inherent in the student movement of
the I960’s. In their book, Action For A
Change. Nader and Ross wrote. "The
essence of the proposal was that students
tax themselves it nominal sum ($2.00 per
studettt per semester) in order to hire ad-
vocates to seek creative solutions to public
interest problems." PIRGS' staff and
students work togctlter to shape public
policy in such areas as energy. social justice,
political reform. consumer protectiort, and

 

fiscal responsibility. The PIRGS are

NYPIRG ~I:i_g_hts Back

governed by a student board which makes
all project arid policy decisions for the
statewide organizations.

Since it was incorporated irt I973,
NYPIRG ltas had a major impact on public
policy decisions. NYPIRG's successes in-
clude the passage of the country's first
Truth irt Testing Law. which makes the
testing corporations more accountable to
students. the passage of the Generic Drug
Law which enables consumers to purchase
prescription drugs at lower prices. and the
organization of two of the largest anti-
nuclear rallies in the United States. In addi-
tion, NYPIRG lawsuits, utility rate in-
terventions, self help guides. and in-
vestigative reports (on issues including bank
redlining. rtuclcur waste transport, and tox-
ics in drinking water, have saved New
Yorkers millions of dollars and con-
siderable grief. while encouraging students
to work for social change.

Each scrttester, NYPIRG students on col-
lege campuses across New York State
develop research and advocacy skills
through their work on a wide variety of
projects. For example, this semester
SUNYA students will lcarrt about and
gather support for legislation including the
Bottle Bill. the Clean Indoor Air Act. and
Aide for Part-time Students. Other students
will write and deliver speeches on a wide
range of consumer issues including Truth In
Testing attd the Generic Drug Law. Still
other students will organize events such as
NYPIRG's Statewide Spring Conference.
