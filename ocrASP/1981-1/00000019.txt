RPIHands J .V. Danes Seventh Defeat

by Marc Hnspel
The Albany State junior varsity
basketball team lost to the RP]

I ' Engineers. 62-51. Saturday night at

University Gym. The loss dropped
their record to 3-7. In the last few
weeks, a jayvcc loss has usually int-
plied a bad performance. Not so on
Saturday. though.

Two problems faced the Danes as
the Engineers walked on the court.
Onc, titcy were big. "RPI must
have had six inches on us." said
Albany hcad J.V. basketball coach
Rick Skccl. Two, they were hot.

. They had just lost itt double over-

time to Union, 84-81. but beforc
that. had won the Skidmorc Tour-
nament which also featured Vassar
and Skidmorc.

RPI also carried only cigltt
players on the roster. Eight big
scorers —— two of which, K.C. (‘01
[lbs and Eric Wcinbcrgct‘. have
averages upwards of twenty points.

All things considcrcd. it scented
that Albany had it tough gttmc
ahead of them in tipoff time.

After both [cums Irttdcd a pull of
bnskcls. RPI on two buckets by
Collins (leading scorer, 21 points).
one by Wcinbcrgcr and one by 11111
Bowers. scored four straight
baskets and jumped out to it 12-4
lead. Dunc Wilson 'l‘honnts drcw it
foul and stink ottc free throw for
Albany’s first point in tire spun of

3:22. After :1 Craig Kinns outside
shot added two more for Albany.
RPI scored another five consecutive
points.

The Danes were taking shots but
just were not hitting many of them.
“We couldn't have put the ball iii
the ocean in the first half." cont-
mcntcd Skccl.

“Our shooting pcrccntagc had to
be 30 percent Ill IIIL‘ first half." suid
Dane Bill Rilcy.

“We weren’t playing smart
ball.” added Albany forward Dcatt
Gracbcll.

By halftime, the Engineers httd
opened up a 35-1‘) lead. RPI had
played an effective zonc utilizing
their height and held the Danes big
scorers like Thomas and llilly
Evcrctt to under five points.

Riding the crust of u momentum
wttvc. RPI ctnnc back onto thc
court for the second hull and open-
ed with it thunderous shun dunk by
Collins. But Albany kcpl bottling
itnd reached within nine points
several times. r

With 14:08 on the clock. Albituy
got within nine for thc first (into on
Grin-bull‘s two succcssl'ul foul
shots. Again. with 11:42 left,
Grucbcli put tltc Dunes only niuc
points behind with a short jnmpct'
from insidc. lint tliitl wuss about its

gatnc (1:05 remaining), an Everett
backcourt steal and lay up put
Albany behind by eight points. But
Collins quickly followed with a
bucket to make the score 61-51, and
seconds later Bowers sank a final
free throw to end the game at 62-51.

Albany outscored RPI 32-19 in
the second half. keeping tltc contest
somewhat close after it poor firsl
half. “They Came back tough in the
second half. they're a good ball
team." said RPI basketball couch
Bill Twccdy of the Dunes.

“Wc ltcld them chI in the second
half. cvcn otnscoring 111cm." said
Skccl. “But we got too fur behind

early. They played a zone and we
had much smaller guys. That's what
really hurt."

The Dancs' coach was particular—
ly pleased with the efforts of a few
of his players. especially that of
Mark Ford. Skccl used Ford late in
Iltc game as point guard and he had
four points and a stcttl.

“We had to conic buck out there
with somc firc power. We had to get
tough." said Ford. referring to thc
Duncs' second half ploy.
