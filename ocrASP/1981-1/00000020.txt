Hurting Grapplers

Once again defeat came all too
easily to a hurting Albany State
wrestling squad as they dropped
three consecutive matches by wide
margins on Saturday in University
Gym.

it’s been the same old story all
season. Nagging injuries and a lack
of depth have forced Albany's hand
more often than not. and Satur-

at the beginning of the sensor. fade
closer and closer toward- oblivion.
With only two matches before the
SUNYAC Tournament in
Brockport and winless in their ﬁve
SUNYAC bouts. it appears that the
Danes will have to be satisﬁed with
a few fine individual efforts and
their hopes for a healthier. more ex-
perienced learn for next year.

“Under the circumstances there
were sotnc good points and some
bad points. but we have a long way
to go before we‘ll be where we want
to be," said a dcjcctcd Albany head
wrestling coach Joe DeMco.
"We‘re having a season really bet-
tcr than you could cypch with all
the young guys we have. It looks
bcltcr for next year if we continue
to improve."

DcMco also noted that tltc qunli-
ty of thc contpclition they huvc

been facing is excellent. “We
wrestled a Division 1 school, one of
the top Division ll schools, and the
sixth ranked Division lll school (in
Saturday's meet). Sometimes the
scores alone don't indicate whether
or not a team is improving," he
said.

Although the Danes only won six
matches all day. a few individuals
continue to impress. Foremost
among them is freshman sensation
Andy Scras. Scras. at 15-0 in dual
competition, now has the best
undefeated season in the 33 year
history of wrestling at Albany
State. and will be shooting for a
perfect 17-0 next Saturday when the
Danes take on RP! and the Coast
Guard in University Gym at 1:00.
On Saturday hc brcczcd through his
three matches with a minimum of
difficulty. winning 9-]. I0-l. and

l4—2.

The other outstanding wrestler
for Albany all year has been Vic
i-tcrman. Herman won two of his
hrcc matches on Saturday. in-
:luding a thriller against Clark of
vlassachusetts, 3-0. and a ramp
)ver Wilson of St. Lawrence, 16-0.

"Scras was great and Vic. was
tutstanding in two matches," noted
DcMco. "Herman and Seras are
looking like people who could do
my well in the SUNYACs and Na-
tlonals."

Warren Wray also won a match
and Mark Goossens put in an
outstanding performance in defeat
against a top heavyweight, Allen
from Massachusetts. Goosscns was
down 5-0 at the end of the first
period, but rallied to within 7-6
with a minute to go before losing.
9—6.

Women’s Track Team Takes Third

The Albany Stntc womcn's in-
door truck tcttm opcucd their
season on Saturday morning at
Cortland placing third in a field of
four teams.

“For the opening meet it wasn‘t
that bad on cxpclicncc," said
Albany couch Bobbi l’ulm. “We
did suffer two injuries. but we think
they are minor injurics."

The two injuries may have bccn
minor. but they did lmrt Albany's
chances to plncc higher in the meet.

Sandy Wilbcr qualil‘icd for the
finals in two cvcnts but was unublc
to compctc in them bccuusc of the
injury. Wither qualified for thc
final in thc shot put. but sltc cumc
up lmnc ttl'tcr hct' plcliminury jump
in the long jump and was out for
the day. even though that one jump
was good cnough to qualify hcr.

l)cb Edwards pluccd third in thc
high jump. clearing 4-H. fourth in
the long jump and fourth in 1ch

Other top finishers for the Danes
wcre Jocelyn l-lcss, who finished
fifth in thc 55 meter hurdles. and
Joan McDuitl. who placed fifth in
the high jump.

Cortland was the overall winner
of thc mcct, followed by Alfred.
Albany. and Binghumton. Despite
not having any individual winners.
Palm was positivc in her appraisal
of thc Incct.

"it wasn‘t bad for our first mect.
All of the other teams had at least
one mecl prior to this. This was
Cortland's fourth meet." she ex-

pluined.

Women's indoor track is still a
chcloping sport in New York and
Palm's main goals for the season
are to make certain everybody is in
shape for the more devclopcd spr-
ing outdoor program and to see
some improvement in the squad.

The Dancs ncxt compete on
Saturday an the University of Ver-
monl, where they will also face Cor-
tland. Massachusetts. and Platt-
sburgh.
