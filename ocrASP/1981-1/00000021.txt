Owl’s Early Delay Strategy-Stalls;
Pressure Ignites 65-53Dane Win

by Bob Bellaflore

The last type of basketball game
Pete Stanish would want to play is a
slow one. For the last three years.
the 6—2,, 185 pound Bingharnton
transfer has made his mark on
Albany basketball as a substitute,
bringing his exciting brand of play
off the bench to give the Danes a lift
when they needed one, and adding
a dimension of intensity and energy
that perhaps none of his teammates

So Saturday night, when
Southern Connecticut came into
University Gym displaying the slow,
deliberate. and almOst boring style
of offense that enabled them to
defeat Division 11 nationally ranked
Sacred Heart earlier in the week.
Stanish, whose team high 21 points
(and 10 for 11 from the floor) ig-
nited Albany to a 65-53 win, was
not pleased.

“1 wasn't sure (about Southern's
strategy) in the beginning," Stanish
said. "but as the first half went on,
1 thought it was a good idea because
they didn’t have the talent. Per-
sonally. 1 don't like it. 1 don’t like
the slow tempo of a game like
that."

By employing a delay type of of-
fense very early in the first half,
Southern Connecticut figured,
naturally enough. that if Albany
couldn't get its hands on the ball.
they couldn’t score.

“We wanted to keep it slow,”
said Art Leary, head coach of the
5-12 Owls. “We wanted to stay
close."

The strategy worked for only the
first few rrrinutcs of the game. The
Owls turned the ball over twice in a
row. and when Stanislr's steal and
lay up gave Albany a 7-6 lead with
13:45 to go. it was catch up time for
the visitors from New Haven.
Center John Dicckelman put in an
alley oop pass from Rob Clune (14
points) fora three point advantage,
yet it wasn't until a Clune basket
off another steal, and a Ray Cesare
jump shot that the Danes got some
breathing room in this low scoring

half (17-11).

Albany hit the Owls with some of
their own sleeping potion by eating
off the final 4:05 of the half with
Southern sitting back in their zone
defense.

“if they were going to do it to
us." Stanish said, “when we got a
four or six point lead, were going to
in the stall."

“The way we were going. said
Albany head basketball coach Dick
Sauers. “i figured we might as well

Stanish said.
if there was any Owl player that
may have given Albany any trouble
it was guard Tony Gonzales. The
junior hit for a game high 31 points,
and ran the show for Southern.

“We knew he was their main
shooter," Suucrs said. Gonzales
took the scoring burden on himself,
putting up 26 shots from the floor
(he hit 10), and making good on 11
of 14 free throws.

Even with Gonzalez’ great in-
dividual effort. the Owls were
bothered by Albany’s pressure in
the second half, and seemed to lose
their composure every time the
Danes picked up the tempo.

Hungry Dane Trackmen Take Home Some Gold

by Michael Carmen

An inexperienced but hungry
Albany State men‘s track and field
team traveled to Cortland Saturday
and returned home with a second
place ﬁnish and plenty of gold in a
four team meet.

Cortland took first place in the
meet gathering 115-1/2 points.
Albany State grabbed 564/2 points
to top Binghamton and Platt-
sburgh.

Albany's high point in the event
occurred in the 55-meter hurdles.
Mitch Harvard hit the tape ﬁrst
with a 7.9 second clocking. Steve
Decter and Brian Ragule finished
close behind at 8.1 seconds in se-
cond and third place. respectively.
to complete the sweep.

Howie Williams brought homr
gold for the Danes in the 55-mcter
dash. His little was 6.5 seconds. on-
ly .3 seconds off the Albany State
record. “Howie had a tremcrrdotrs
start off the blocks and just ran a
good race," stated Dane track and
field coach Bob Munsey.

The one mile relay tcanr, con
sisting of Pete Passidomo, Hr“
vurd, Williams, and Tony Fch
also took gold as they triun
with a 3:37.9 time. “The tir

slow, but a win is a win." corn-
mented Mutrsey.

Without a highjumper (Ed Millet
was injured) the Danes looked for a
placing in the long jump. Bruce
Briggs supplied that as he jumped
6.19 meters. Tim Gtrntlrcr also plac-
ed fourth in the event.

in the 3000-metcr run, Chris Lant
captured first place in 9:10. "This

was only Chris' second meet ever.

He is usually a cross cottrrtry runner
and this victory was a plettsnnl sur-
prise.” added Mutrscy.

The SOO-meter run turrted out to
supply the conrcdy for the meet.
First. Paul Eichelbcrger came in
fourth with a l:ll.5 time turd Tony
Ferretti placed fifth. clocking in at
1:12.3. The humor occurred on the
final lap of the event. As they
rounded the track one last tinrc, all
the runners started their final kick.
One runner didn’t. l'crrctti lost
track of the lap and was left behind
the pack. Fortunately, he managed
to get together to finish fifth.

“Anthony has it good kick and
worrld have had it chance of winn-
ing if he didn't make that mental er-
ror. We're still kidding him about
his blooper." said the coach.

Briggs also placed sceotrd in the

triple jump. His hop. skip, and
jump of 13.75 meters was good
enough for a silver medal.

Bruce Shapiro. who helped the
two mile relay team gain a third
place. also managed a fourth place
showing in the l000-nrctcr run.
“His time was slow. but if you
follow him he will become a
devastating runner. He's a gutsy
kid." praised Munsey.

Most of the times were slow in
last Saturday’s meet. The ZOO-meter
indoor facility was not conducive
to fast times becarrsc of long
straightaways and tight turns.

A clutch performance was also
turned in by Dane Todd Silva. He
took third place itr thc 5000-nrctcr
run. coming across at 16:28.

This Saturday the Danes take
their road show to Rl’l. where they
will face the host tcatn. Sierra-Col-
lege and Hudson Valley Communi-
ty College.

“We will see sorrre good competi-
tion. Rl’l will probably have no
throwers nnd Sicna will be our main
competition in the running events,"
evaluated Mrrnscy.

The Duties still lack experience.

Core. Requirements Debated

by Mark Flschctti

“There is a feeling among many
of the faculty and deans that there
should be some forru ofdistribution
rcqtrircrrrcnts on campus." said
Daniel Wolff, Dean of the College
of Science and Mathematics. and
chair oftltc Committee on Distribu-
tion Requirements.

The committee. which was up-
poirrtcd last fall. hopes to have a
comprehensive report completed by
March 1, Wolff said.

The lo-rncmber committee is
composed of two representatives
from each of the three colleges: one
each front the six schools. two
members of the academic affairs
faculty. and two students. If it pro-
pnstll resulting from the comittcc‘s
report meets the approval of the
Liberal Education Advancement
l’rogrmrr (LEAP), it will be corr-
sidcrcd for approval by the
Undergraduate Academic Council
(UAC). the University Senate. and
SUNYA President
(')'l.cnry.

 

Physical Plant Department Director Dennis Stevens

Wulff said the proposal. if pass-
ed. would be implemented no
earlier than the fall '82 semester.

LEAP, supervised by Helen
Desfosses. Dean of Undergraduate
Sttrdics and a corrrnrittce member, is
it pilot educational program in its
first year at SUNYA. Approximate-
ly 300 freshmen participating in the
program choose from required
courses offered in six broad
categories.

“A lot of work went into
deciding thcsc categories."
Desfosscs said. “They will be rrscd
as it basis for the distribution rc-
quircmcnts system.“

According to Dcsl'osscs, if
distribution requirements were in‘
stilutcd hcrc, enclr SUNYA student
would have to complete one or two
courses from art array of courses in
each of the following categories:

how many credits in these courses
will be required.

“That is the crux of the issue.“
Wolff said.

Wolff projects that a minimum
of 18 credits would be required. arr-
ticipating that six of these would be
satisfied anyway by completing the
requirements for any major. The
maximum number of
quircd would he 36.

Dcsl'osscs maintains that students
will not be ndvcrscly affected by
distribution rcqtrircrrrerrts. '

"The net affect of the proposed
distribution system will not be tr
significant dislocation of the typical
undergraduate program." she said.

“i fch it is very important that
students get the proper courses.“
Dcsfosscs said. “Not only to get
that first job, but to prepare them
for their career and for life‘s job.

“1 see the distribution system as
an aid in advising students irr choos-
ing their courses," Dcsfosses said.

Dcsfosses said the issue has been

“1 would like to ttssrlt'c everybody

The committee, which consists of

recommenanions regarding the

estimated the cost of repairing the

Sections of the podirrrn have

He added that sections of the

no gaps are left between the slabs.

However, Stevens said. after
several years caulking "loses it
resiliency like an old rubber band."

During the recent cold weather the
concrctc slabs contracted, btrt thc
caulking did not expand to follow
their movements. thereby leaving
gaps between the slabs. The gaps
allowed rain to penetrate the ceiling
of the lecture center.

Instead of rcerurlking. Stevens
said. the department has to use their
regular operational funds for
"stop-gap measures" that will not
prevent further leakage.

Director of Financial Manage-
ment Gene Gilchrist explained
that no money was made available
for the repairs because the number
of projects waiting to be under-
taken exceeds the money available
for allocation.

Within the SUNY budget. writ-
ten by the Governor and the DOB
and approved by the state.
legislature. is an allocation for
“special fund estimates." SUNY
disperses the money
allocated to campuses on the basis
of their needs. However. Gilchrist.
explained. the allocation for
"special fund estimates" was not
irrcrcascd.

In the meantime, Stevens plans to
get an estimate from a contractor of
how much 11 rccnulking job would
cost in the area near the campus
center, try to do small recmrlkitrg
jobs with his own staff.~ and cort-

tinue to collect the leaking water
before it becomes a hazard in stu-
dent traffic areas.

l‘lowever, Stevens added that this
places an added work load on
maintenance staff. In addition, un-
checked leakage could result in
. building structure damage.
