“Hospitality House ” Offers Emotional Rescue

by Brian Schwagerl

Michael Burke recalls a time
when life didn’t seem worth living.
He remembers being locked up in a
mental ward, detoxifying from
methadone. and of being skeptical
that a drug rehabilitation program
called Hospitality House could
chan e his life.

News FEATURE

But those recollections date back
to 1976, and now Burke, the House
phase-out director, has dreams of
starting a dmg rehabilitation pro-
gram of his own someday.

There are no distinguishing
characteristics outside 6 Madison
Place in downtown Albany to set
apart this brownstone structure
from any other on the street. All the
houses have the same view from
their balconies of the Gov. Nelson
E. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza.
the Cathedral of the immaculate
Conception. and interstate 787. in-
side. however, people view the
world with a different perspective.

Hospitality House is a non-
profit, private. residential co‘m-
munity for young people between
the ages of 16 to 25 who have a

 

history of dmg and/or alcohol
abuse and related emotional
disorders.

“There are people here with drug
problems amd there are people here
without drug problems.” Burke ex-
plained. "But the bottom line is
that they both have the same emo-
tional problems. Drugs per 5e are
not the problem; it's the problems
that have led to the drugs and that's
what we deal with here.”

Funded through the Division of
Substance Abuse Services. Social
Services, parents, and donations
from different organizations.
Hospitality House works closely
with Youthful Drug Abuse, the
courts. and the probation systems
“to offer a viable rehabilitation
program as an alternative to jail."

Burke. who was in the
methadone program for ﬁve years.
remembers when he “could see his
life just slipping away.

“My relationships with my fami-
ly and my girlfriend were just going
down the tubes," he continued. “1
was doing all kinds of things that
were not 'me'. i was an honor stu-

dent in school, bright, into sports,
and popular, and i could see that all
that was going.

"Then i got really desperate and
depressed. i ended up going to the
Capital District Psychiatric Center
and speaking to a counselor there. I
was so depressed that I thought that
i might kill myself. i stayed there
for about five days and then went
into the Albany Medical Center to
detox from the methadone pro-
gram. 1 was on E-Z. a mental ward
that was locked. People were
slashing their wrists. walking
around and staring into space, and
walking into walls.

“it was a pretty heavy ex-
perience," he says now, laughing
about the whole ordeal. “l was
there for ten days and in the mean-
time the director of the program.
Father Michael Hogen. who was the
executive director at the time. came
and spoke to me. i had decided that
i had to do something and this was
a good chance."

A minimum of ten hours of for-
mal counseling a week is furnished
by_lhc program, including at least
eight hours of group therapy and
two hours of individual therapy. A
Hospitality House resident is also
exposed to fifteen hours per week
of structured education and/or

vocational training by an in-house

teacher. Special emphasis is placed‘

on building positive self-images as
well as interpersonal skills and self-
discipline.

The cardinal rules of Hospitality
House include no physical violence,
no use of drugs or alcohol,
maintenance of a platonic relation-
ship with fellow ciients. no
unauthorized absences from the
facility, maintenance to the best of
the individual's ability of an honest
relationship with staff and fellow
clients. and discussion of termina-
tion with staff before withdrawing
from treatment.

“As a group we refer to each
other as a family and relationships
and brother-and-sister relationships
in the house." Burke said. “Oncs
you're a member of the family
you're always a member of the
family — even when you leave.
When a person first comes here
they're not a member of the family
until they talk to every member and
explain why they're here, why they
want to be here. and what they
hope to do here.

"it‘s hard for the first five or six
months. but once you’re into
what's going on, where you’re at.
and what you're potential might be

it gets easier. You suddenly realize
that you have relationships with
people you care about and that for
the ﬁrst time in your life you may
feel loved or needed.

“Knowing that someone cares
about you and unconditionally ac-
cepts you even when you make
mistakes is a tremendous burden
taken off of you. Just being who
you are and ﬁnding out that people
can accept you for that is deﬁnitely
a confidence builder and good for
the ego."

Burke said a veteran of the pro-
gram ”has a pretty good chance of
finding a job. ‘

“Schools are also glad to take
them because they know they're
responsible, they've made some
commitments and they have decid-
‘cd what they want to do," he con-
tinued. "A large number of people
that hava phased-out like to go to
college. Right now we have four
people going into the College of St.
Rose and four already there that are
on their way out."

Burke himself will be graduating
this year from St. Rose. Majoring
in criminology, he takes great pride
in the school ring he wears on his
left hand. He will have earned his
diploma while working six days a
week as a regular staff member at
Hospitality House.
