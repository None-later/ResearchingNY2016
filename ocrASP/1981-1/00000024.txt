toxic shock decline

Toxic Shock Syndrome, a
sometimes fatal disease that was
linked with tampon use last fall. has
been declining dramatically in the
U.S. since last September when na-
tlonwide health warnings were
issued.

According to the Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta. the
number of new cases of Toxic
Shock Syndrome dropped by more
than 60 per cent by the end of last
year.

Studies conducted last summer
’ " ‘ that women who used
Proctor and Gamble’s "Rely"
brand tampons were 8 times more
likely to develop Toxic Shock Syn-
drome than users of most other
brands. Proctor and Gamble volun-
tarily removed Rely from the
market inst September.

Researchers at the Center for
Disease Control suggest the decline
of Toxic Shock cases may be due to
the removal of Rciy from the
market, combined with the decline
in sales of other brands of tampons.

The center also says that tmtii last

September. 70 per cent of all
menstruating women .used tam-
pons. industry sources say the pro-.
portion is now between 50 and 55
per cent.

nuts about nlxon

The southern California town of
San Clemente has come up with a
way of saying thanks to former
President Richard Nixon for put-

jS—j

ting the town on the map.

San Clemente. California. where
Nixon lived before moving to
Washington, is honoring Nixon
with a new $800,000 museum in his
name. Tile musucm holds a bronze
bust of the former president and
two ﬂoors full of pictures and ar-
tifacts to remind Son Clcmcntc’s
townspeople of the eleven years
Nixon lived there.

 

. Albany Student Press

Charlie Ashbaugh. President of
the San Clemente Historical Society
says (quote) “We saw his value in
being here because he did put us on
the map and we had the reﬂected
glory." Ashbaugh added that, “We
bore the burden of his humiliation
and that was hard to take. but we
didn’t hate him." -

One thing that wasn’t found
amidst the Nixon memorabilia in
the museum was any reminder of
Richard Nixon's resignation from
the Presidency.

 

Housing

cited trips to Dippikiii and thc

ner. and a quickly organized party
last weekend as examples.

Junior Howie Curc explained
that "people move in here with pre-
conccivcd ideas about what this is
likc.-Tllcy try to extend themselves
more."

Whether or not this initial drivc

Council of Deans."

in addition, she said, the Middle
States Accreditation Team which
reviewed SUNYA last December
for its next ten years of national ac-
creditation, was very surprised to
scc that SUNYA did not have a
distribution systcm. They feel all
schools should have them,
Dcsfosses said.

According to Wolff. “A person
who graduates with a degree should
have been exposed to certain kinds
of knowledge considered basic to an
educated person." That is why
most faculty and committee
members are in favor of distribu-
tion requirements. he said.

"For instance, as it is now," he
explained, “it student can get a
tlcgrcc without cvcr going outside
the College of Science and
Mathematics.

The argument against distribu-
tion requirements is that they limit
academic freedom of choice.
"Courses listed as requirements
might not be the best for a student’s
interests," Wulff acknowledged.

SUNYA is one of only a few New
York State schools that does not
have distribution requirements.
Desfosses said they are accepted as
a matter of course at other schools.

“Just like learning where the
lockers are," she said. “ . . . they
learn to fill their core re-
quirements." However, according
to committee member Lori Peppe.
most students asked oppose
distribution requirements.

“They don't like the idea of be-
ing forced to take classes, of being
tied down," she said.

Pcppe said she and Lisa
Newmork, the only two student
committee members, are the only
two on the committee not in favor.

When the committee was formed
by the Council of Deans, "they put
on people they knew were in favor
of distribution requirements."
Newmark claimed. but they
acknowledged the fact that they
“had to" allow some student
representation.

“But they honestly fccl distribu-
tion rcquircmcnts are good for
students," she said of thc commit-
lcc members. “The report is very
honest."

“This is only the first step in
whxu could become a major issue"
Pcppc added. “Student reaction
will bring u lot of controversy," if
thc proposal goes to tile senate.
