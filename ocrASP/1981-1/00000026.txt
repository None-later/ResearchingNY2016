America's ex-hostages are re-adiustlng to
freedom as well as can be expected after the
severe strain of four hundred and forty four‘
days in the captivity of the government of
iron. The Americans are enjoying their new-
found freedom and the newspapers still
abound with their tales . . .

Just yesterday, Barbara Rosen. wife of ex-
hostage Barry Rosen, held a press con-
ference outside their Flatbush home: “Barry

Dear Ann Landers:

You know what i think of your specialists.
Ann? They don‘t know anything more than i
do. They Just use diagrams.

Listen Ann. 1 appreciate what you're try-
ing to do. Don't think i wasn't grateful when
you told us the correct way a roll of toilet
paper should hang (underneath). And since
l'm also a Clergyman from Cohoes, l ap-
preciate the extra business.

Nor am i entirely blaming you. The people
who write in are equally to blame. What hap-
pened to the good old days. when people
kept their problems sealed behind closed
doors. when crisis was nothing a shot of
whiskey or a slap in the mouth couldn't fix?

All l'm saying. Ann. is that after 26 years
of obvious advice. cute answers and soap-
box preaching, the time has come to turn In

we are of deceit. Forgotten lives and hearts

there any use for us besides this?

The rooms I don't Inhabit. are they a pro—
duct of intent or is this just a joke? When we
remove the distance between us it causes me
to feel the true movement of our time
together. Stars force light upon darkness. as
we play “footsie” with our colored glass
houses in the sky. Robots lead the way
towards a vacuum called the future.

Within the next two or three weeks we will
all find ourselves in situations that we would

war. but nonetheless. a war which is fully
capable of becoming just as destructive and
just as costly. it is a conflict whose outcome
will be as decisive as any military engage-

None of us asks either to be born or to die.

separations. each accompanied by new
