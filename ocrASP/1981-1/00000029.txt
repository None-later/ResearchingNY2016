comment

odd groups of students, together because
they share a common interest. So whether it
be booking well-known speakers or put-
chasing somc great kinds of food. get
yourself into an exciting, relaxed at-
mosphere where you can seek out new
adventures and boldly go where you have
not gone befor'c. Put some excitement in
your day. Albany State isn't always so
drcury. Come on up to the Campus Center

‘Bailroom this coming Tuesday and

Wednesday. (Feb. tom and llth). Reach
out. touch. look. explore. and have a good
time.

Security Ordinance

To the Editor: ‘

I wish to clarify a few statements made in
your Feb. 3 article on the proposed security
ordinance. Your opening paragraph slates.
"After four monlits of steady debate bet-
ween landlords and tenants groups. no deci-
sion has been reached on the passage of the
proposed security ordinance." There has in
fact been no debate between landlords and
tenants as thc city had promiscd, and thc ci-
ty has quite clearly decided to kill the or-
dinance. After more limit 100 people at—
tcridcd a public hearing on tltc ordinance
(Oct. 2). Albany Common Council Hous-
ing Committee Chair Joscph Bucclts
(Aldcrmun. Ward 6). stated that it would
not be “business as usual". and promised
that lie would set tip at incctitig irt ten days
to have landlords and tenants try to reach
sortie compromise on iitc proposed strin-
dards. Dcspitc tiiiiticrous rcqucsts by tcrtnin
groups to Mr. iiucclis .to hold such it
meeting. Mr. Bucchs rcfuscd to do so.

After wccks of dcltiy rind uiirclurrtcd

of more lhiin lt)0 pcoplc to Mayor Coming
to complain about tltc dchiy in passing the

refusal of Mr. ilucchs to even ltold u
inccting on lhc issnc. Wlicn iltc ("ill-in
which took place on Nov. I7 producd no

of landlords rind tenants to ricgoiintc ii

four city officials would testify. andilic
public would not be allowed to speak.

it was quitc Cictli’ than this hearing was an
orchcstmtcd kangaroo . :ion against the
ordinance. Mr. Bucchs l chairperson pro-
posed that the city not pass thc ordinniicc.
but instcnd wait to see if section 23513 of tltc
rczil property law would solve tltc problem.
Scc. 2351) prohibits landlords from subjec-
ting lcnnrils to "titty conditions which
would be dangerous. hazardous on
detrimental to iltcir lcnuitl's life. health. or
safety." Titc rest of the Committee quickly
agreed to his proposal. and the meeting was
ndjourncd.

Thc Allinncc for Safety inciiibcrs irri-
incdintcty confronted Bitcchs when the
meeting was ovcr. thn we pointed out
that each of his four speakers appeared to
have i: basic misunderstanding of the securi-
iy ordinance. itc asked why wc hudn'l con-
fronted thcm with these facts. Titc answer.
of course. was tiltll Bucchs had refused to
allow any publication participation during

to force cacit tenant to suc itf court to win a

Appalled by Budget

To the Editor:

'Governor Hugh Citrcy and the New York
State Division of Budget have once again
been successful in placating the ad-
ministrative and teaching bodies of
SUNYA in their t9Bl-82 “Executive Ap-
peasement Budget." New York State sup-
port for '81-'82 has been approved at
558.974.0011 up $4,883,100 or 9 percent.
from last years $54,090,000.

Students realize directly the consequences
of this insufﬁcient increase in the form of
increased class size. less teacher availability.
a decrease in the quality of housing. in-
creased room occupancy. and nearly
perpetual increases in tuition and room and
board mics. They will. and rightfully
should. speak out.

But New York State is immune to these
cries. They "have heard it all before." and
so has the public. and no one seems to pay
much noticc anymore. “Oh. the students
are crying again." they say. The key to pct-
mnncntly changing New York State's an-
nual appeasement budget lies with SUNYA
teachers and administrators.

The ‘81-‘82 budget calls for $5,152,100 in
salary increases. It was through the tough
unified struggle of teachers that the increase
was granted. While not gcticrous. ii is a
reasonable increase. which by all means is
deserved by our quality educators. But the
tenacious stand must be continued, funds
for the “real stuff" of education; faculty
and staff positions. tcachcrs' aids. and sup-
plies and expenses have all been cut. This
makes the faculty's job very difficult. In-
stead of beingjust ahead of inﬂation. so we
may even be able to expand and improve
the university. every facet of the uttiversity
will be fighting to kccp its head above
water. instead of spending time on improv-
ing its work.

"But salaries were raised!" New York
State says. Appeasement.

The '8i-'82 budget calls for an incrcasc in
:funds for utilities. Fuel and electric costs
have risen sharply. and the Executive Board
'of the Budget would be foolish in not mis-
ing utility funds. Yet. they've turned right

 

 

around and cut maintenance and opera--

tions funds by “83.600. So in reality they

have allocated money for higher priced.

utilities to heat and light rooms which leak.
and are faulty. and which cannot be
repaired because there is no money to repair
them with. This is hardly prudent money
managcmcnt.

“But we increased utility allotments!"
New York State says. Appeasement.

The plain fact that the budget has been
raised. but not raised enough, exemplifies
the Sltllc'h‘ attitude toward our teachers and
administrators. An increase of nine percent
when ihc ‘82-‘83 budget will be considcrcd.
and in 1932 when iliiglt Carey comes tip for
rcclcction. Wc must keep reminding them
of the voices they heard tltc last time tltcy
ptisscd ti hogtis budget.

Education is the fundamental right of‘

cvcry citizcrt of this nation. Let us not be
tlppctlscd. htit :tppirilcd.

Setting Standard

in 1970. SUNYA initiated a plan of liberalized education. The university
decided to eliminate the old fornt of standardized education.

At the time itsccmcd like a great idea. it was the end of the turbulent 60's
with student unrest. massive campus protests and desperate cries for change.
th somewhere in their pleas. they lost their better judgment. Students were no
longer required to take a variety of classes; for the most part they only had to
take courses in tltcir majors.

Did we gain freedom of choice or simply reduce our standards?

it seems a damn shame that prestigious corporations have been forced to
train cxccutives to write simple correspondences. Shouldn't this responsibility
be assumed by the university?

in the last few years. the magnet to SUNYA has been its business school.
Onc of its strengths is that it requires its students to take courses in many other

. subjects.

This business school should serve as a model for the rest of the university.
Just as a business major must take care requirements of math. economics.
cnglish. speech and social science. so should the rest of the student body.

Although the idea of a well-rounded education might sound Victorian. it is
imperative. Today’s working force is required to know a wider range of sub-
jects than ever before. Tltc new distribution requirements would make
graduates more marketable.

Just as grades providc standards. so do distribution requirements. Adding
such requirements would uliimatcly increase the value of onc’s diploma.

A university is itot a trade or technical scltooi. ideally. it is a center for
diverse and advaiiccd ltigilL‘l‘ cducation. such a system will force a rc-cvalution
of classes and programs.

For incoming frcsltritctt. tltis could be extremely important. it would force
tltcm to take courses tltcy might not tukc otherwise. And it might even alter
their choice of a major.

Altltougli thcsc i'cquircincrtts will have no effect on prcsctil students. we are
tlic orics who are most quztlit‘icd to make the necessary changes. in a way we
have suffered. As we look back in our academic past, how many of us wish we
had bccrt for'ccd to try siiiijccts unrelated to our majors?

The value of distribution i‘cqtiircnicnts will not be shown for at least five
ycztrs. But can wc let the L‘lll‘fitni sitiiiilion last arty longer?

We would like your opinion. Within two weeks we will be distributing a
questionnaire around thc campus to find out what you think. '
