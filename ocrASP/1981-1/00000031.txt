Willi only 26 seconds left and
Albany down four points, Everett
hit from the right side basclinc on a
play [lint dcvclopcd off an intercep-
tion by Thomas. Hamilton took
possession on the basket but ﬁve
seconds luicr were called for walk-
ing, giving Albany back the bail.
Skccl promptly called a time out to
plan it lust-second shot. That play
to try to post Thomas for a possible
three-point play failed and Everett's
desperation shot at the buzzer hit
the rim but was not good.

“We tried to get the ball to
Wilson for in final three-point play.
i figured that we had nothing to
lose at that point," said Skeel. “if
the cutter would have made his
move, it might have worked," he
continued, noting is failure of ex-
ecution on the play.

Once again, the Danes had put
up quite a battle taking their oppo-
nent right down to the final buzzer.
“They played very tough," said
Hamilton J.V. head basketball
coach Bob Montana. “I feel very
fortunate to have beaten them."
