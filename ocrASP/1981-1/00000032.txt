Re building Women ’3 Basketball Drops A Pair

BOW To Siena And St. Michaels

. by Lori Cohen

The outcomes were not a big sur-
prise to the rebuilding Albany State
women's basketball team. Two
tough losses to Division 11 powers.

‘Siena and St. Michaels, shouted the

much more competitive and higher
grade basketball played in the
higher divisions.

Siena, 15-3. on their way up to
Division 1. showed the excellent ball
handling, passing, and shooting
necessary to become a basketball
power, and trounced the Dane
women, 99-45. Shooting almost
continuously from underneath via
excellent passing. the Siena women

.rarcly missed. Albany's man-to-

man defense took a while to tighten
up. and the Danes fell behind by ten
points’ after only four minutes.
Eileen Fatcheric scored Albany's
first basket, with 16:45 left. on a
turnaround jump shot.

Lynne Burton. playing in a new
position at point guard. took it
upon herself to start some offense
for the slow-moving Danes. Willi
the score l8-4 with 4:01 to go. Bur-
ton reeled off 10 points on ﬁve for

‘ five shooting. bringing Albany as

close as they would get all night.
2244. Getting two buckets from

hustling steals. Burton seemed to
rile up her teammates. Yet at the
half, Nancy Halloran (eight points)
and Burton (18 points) combined
for 26 of Albany's 30 points. “We
are playing our game. and playing it
well. They are just an unbelievably
good team." Albany women's
basketball coach Amy Kidder com-
mented at halftime.

The second half did not prove as
pOsitive for the Danes. Maintaining
their control of the game, Siena
continually penetrated the Albany
man-to—man defense. Eileen Fat-
cheric continued to do well in a
tough job under the boards. grabb-
ing a team high ten rebounds.

it took Albany 4:57 to score their
first basket, a pretty jumper from
the foul line by Halloran. This set
the tone for the Danes. as they
could only manage to produce half
their half-time point total. Siena
put on an excellent exhibition of
passing skills. Burton. cooling
down after her hot first half. ﬁnish-
ed with 20 points. while Halloran
had 14. Sicna‘s two-time All-
American Vicky Armando finished
with 25 points.

“Lynne and Nancy were the only
ones shooting in the first half. so

they keyed thelr_defense on those
two, stopping them, slowing us
down," Kidder reﬂected.

The game against St. Michaels
was another story. Again, facing a
tough team with more skill. Albany
came out down,'75-4l. “They were
more aggressive, quicker. and very
good. We played a horrible first
half, scoring only 11 points. We
were just not moving." Kidder said.

Burton. Albany‘s high scorer.
was held to 12 points in a downcast
Dane offense.

Without the services of co-
captain Halloran. the Dane women
play Skidmore tomorrow night in
University Gym.

Fired-Up Engineers Torpedo Dane Swimmers

by Jeff Sehadoff

in what might have been the most
important meet of the season,
regardless of the ﬁnal score. for
Albany’s men's swim teams. the
Danes were downed by a fired-up
RPi Engineer team. The Danes lost
their fourth meet this season to RPi
Tuesday night. 52-61. to put their
record at 3-4.

This was the first of two meetings
the Danes have with RP] this season
and Albany head swimming coach
Ron White said, “it was one of the
best efforts l've seen in along time.
but it’s not going to happen again.
What is important now is that the
team‘s unity is here. I am most im-
pressed with the attitude that
cveryoody has exhibited. With each
one pitching in. it makes me feel
really great. Right now we‘re going
to go places."

Albany opened up the evening's
events with a super effort in the
400-yard Medley Relay as Jim Col-
gan, Joe Shore. Kevin Ahcrn and
Neil Ullman swam to the opening
victory in 3:49.54. nearly three
Seconds better than their RPi rivals.
“Our first relay went out well. We
beat a near-loaded RPi 400—yard
Medley Relay Team and ours
wasn’t." said White. The race was
highlighted by Colgan's supcr cf-
fort in the event as he put in a per-
sonal best in his backstroke split at
0259.6.

Commenting on his effort.
Ullman explained, “it was my
fastest split this year. Everyone did
their best. it was unimportant relay
and our best team. It turned out to
be a super psych for the rest of the
meet as some of us were enhanced
in oui- psych tactics by shaving
down just prior to the meet.
Overall. 1 was extremely pleased
with the way the race went."

Steve Bonawitz' victories in each
of his three individual events might
be considered a heroic task. in his

 

first event. he swam to an easy vic-
tory in thc lOOO-yard Freestyle
(10:57.72). Again. Bonawitz cruised
in the ZOO-yard Butterﬂy, winning
comfortably by seven seconds in
2:09.72. His "hat trick” was ac-
complishcd only two races later in
the ZOO-yard Backstroke. with a
winning time of 2:06.47.

“i feel that he had one heck of a
triple. To do that is unreal —-
especially with the times he had —
his second best personal time in the

200 Back and his best in the
ZOO—Fly." said White.
With absolutely no surprise

Shore had two individual victories.
in thc ZOO-yard individual Medley
(2:08.14) and the ZOO-yard
Breaststroke (2:19.31). Hc was also
essential in the 400-yard Medley
Relay with his l:02.6 Breaststroke
split.

“What more can i say of the
guy? He goes out every time and

   

wins each and every time —— simply
superb." mentioned White.

Another stupendous Dane triple
was at the hands of Ahern. as he
edged out RPl's Arne Johnson at
the wall in the ZOO-yard Freestyle in
1:50.68. White felt that “it was the
most aggressive, most gutsy. l‘ve
ever seen Kevin swim in dual-meet
competition." Ahern also par-
ticipated in the winning 400-yard
Medley Relay with his split of
0:56.0 and he was just edged out at
the final tap to place a close second
to Johnson in 0:50.15 (10 Johnson‘s
0:49.55).

“In the 200-Frce, l was more ag-
grcssivc than i have been. i really
worked the ﬁrst 100 yards instead
ot'just cruising. i got sandwiched in
between two real good swimmers
and one is really enough." Ahern
said.

"This last week we‘ve really been
.1 together team. We were really

i psyched for the meet and we all go

. out thinking one thing — swimming
-» and that's what counts. This has
been the best team effort l‘ve seen
in the whole four years l've been
here," he added.

Other exciting surprises on the
day included freshman diver Karl
Browne. as he showed vast im-
provement in his delivery and con-
tinuity on the one-meter board. “1
think Kar's gonna make it real name
for himself. As for tonight —— he
made me feel great." said Albany
diving coach Bruce Sicklcs.

As far as the rest of the diving
goes. the Danes are chiefly
represented by senior Bill Dcrkasch,
"Who i thought could have looked
a little sharper. Hill had a tough
break in tiic optional one-meter
event." said Sicklcs.

What occurred was that on one
of Derkusch's dives. as he began his
dive. there was noise from the RH

squad for which the judges gave
Derkasch the option to re-do the
dive, which he did. As it turned out.
Bill's first attempt scored roughly
6-1/2 points more than his second
go-round. The difference was

enough to capture first. yet he took

second in the optional one-meter

event and third in the required

dives.

Yet even more bright spots for
the Danes were Frank Kozakicwicz’
2:25.7 time in his first college
breaststroke. White felt his time
"was unreal and most impressive."
Dave Motola also had an outstan-
ding meet with a time of 2:00.0 in
the ZOO-yard Freestyle and his
0:518 in the last leg of the Freestyle
Relay.

White felt his team's rejuvenated
unity was the most important result
of the meet. “We really needed this.
it was just a matter of understan-
ding. lt's an important phase of
winning to give a complete effort.
it‘s really nice to know we're on the
right track. We still have R?! again
and it's our job to even up the
match. As far as my strategy. it was
right on line. yet it was just a meter
off going out and getting it." he
said.

Assistant coach Frank Heter
commented, “it was my ﬁrst meet
this semester and the team looks
tremendously united compared to
their slump last semester. l’ni very
impressed with the way they swam
overall. i felt Ahern and Bonawitz
had super performances."

“We had to swim a near perfedt
meet to beat RH and there were a
couple of spots where we weren’t so
perfect. yet our 52 points was a
solid meritorlal performance.” con-
cluded White.
