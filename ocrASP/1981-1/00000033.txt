Come Through In 68-64

by Bob Belllflore

CLINTON — in the pre-season,
the rap against the Albany State
basketball team was that they didn't
have enough depth at the guard
position. The Danes wouldn’t be
able to run and play their usual
pressure game, and their
ballhundlers were not capable
enough to adequately quarterback
coach Dick Saucrs' motion offense.
in other words. it was thought that
Albany had no guards.

Yet, the Danes possess a 14-2
record. a nine-game winning streak.
and a number 13 national ranking.

Against Hamilton College Tues-
day night. fouls forced starting
guard Ray Cesare to the bench.
leaving backcourt mate Rob Clune
to carry the load. But he had four
fouls of his own. When the Con-
tinentals’ Charles Robinson made
the game 57-57 as time ran out in
regulation. and Clune himself com-
mitted his ﬁfth and final infraction
only 16 seconds into the overtime
period. it seemed as if Albany.
which led by as much as seven
points in the second half. might
drop the first game of their toughest
week of the season.

“i thought we were in real big
trouble without the guards in over-
time," Sauers said.

This left a backcourt of Pete
Stanish (usually a forward) and
Mike Gatto —- hardly a combina-
tion Sauers would have called on
against New York’s number ﬁve
team unless he had to.

it was that tandem. though. that
clicked on two baskets off of steals.
With four more Albany free throws
(two each by Steve Low and Joe
.lednak), the Danes took a 67-62

 

lead, and went on to win, 68-64.

“Even though we were down
without guards." said Stanish (2|
points for the second straight
game), "i felt excitement for the
first time playing guard."

The excitement was there for the
entire game. even when Robinson's
slam dunk attempt flew off the
back of the rim to open the contest.
The Danes scored twice (a Stanish
jump shot and a Clune banker), and
with Hamilton’s affinity for turning

"r

the ball over early (four in the first .

four minutes). it looked like
Albany's composure and experience
would be a key. But the Continen-
tals' style of running offense got
them some quick buckets while
Albany could not find its shooting
touch (13 for 33 in the first half).
and Hamilton went ahead. 25-22,
with 1:49 left.

The Danes took a 28-27 advan-
tage into halftime when center John
Dicckelman got two of his 10 first
half points (he had a season high
2]). putting in the rebound of

in the second half. Albany
jumped to a 39-32 lead in the first
five minutes. but Hamilton went on
a 23-13 binge, with center Kevin
Grimmer and Robinson accounting
for 14 of those. Grimmer had a
blocked shot as well that brought
the crowd alive, and with 2:12 left,
the Continentals had a 55-52 advan-
tage. Dicckelman sunk two free
throws (he was ﬁve of six from the
line). and when Stanish canned two
more. the Danes led. 56-55 with just
over one minute to go.

Hamilton had a chance to go
ahead with only 14 seconds on the
clock. After delaying for almost a
full minute. Robinson took an eight
foot jump shot from the baseline —
the sitot he wanted to take. but was
off. Jednak and Robinson fought
for the rebound. and on the ensuing
jump ball. guard Bruce Weir's per-
sonal foul on Clune sent the senior
Dane to the free throw line. Clune
hit one. and it proved to be a big
one when Robinson sank iiis‘lay in
at the buzzer.

Then came the defensive heroics
of Stanish and Gatto. and the four
clutch free throws.

While Robinson was Hamilton's
main threat, tltc Danes were more
concerned with containing Grim-
mer, whose 18.5 points per game

average and rebounding lead the’

Cotttincntals. “We didn't want
Grimmer to get the ball inside.“
Sauers said. “Everything we did on
defense was not to let Grimmer get
the ball.”

And that threw a major hitch into
Hamilton coach Tom Murphy's
run-and-gun strategy. He thought
that Grimmer. playing with t
separated shoulder. shouldn‘t have
even been in the line tip. and that
his injury hurt the team. "When
Grimmer doesn't play (well). we
can‘t run." said a very disappointed
Murphy. “We wanted to run on

Danes Don’t Get Caught With Guards Down

them because we knew we were a
quicker team." said Robinson, who
scored 11 straight points for his
team down the stretch. “We
wanted to get the ball off the boards
and go."

Murphy utilized a zone for most
of the game, but switched to a man-
to-man defense in the overtime, and
Sauers ﬁgured it was because of the
personnel. “He thought we would
make mistakes without the
guards," Sauers said.

Albany didn't. As a matter of
fact. the quintet that Sauers had in
(Dieckelman. Stanish, Gatto. Low.
and Jednak) played tight defense.
and aggressive offense — and it
paid off.

“They just really came through.“
Sauers said of his overtime line tip.
“Thc ﬁve of them that were out
there — each came through with a
big play."

indeed, Gatto was the only one
not to score in the extra period. but
he had the key passes on two fast
breaks.

“They’ve got a little more ex-
perience." Murphy said. “We were
ready to play, but we made a few
silly turnovers. it wasn't one of our
best games, bitt they probably had
something to do with that.

“They‘re quick and they hustle."
continued the coach of the 12-3
Continentals. "They play good
defense."

The difference. as it has been
through most oi‘lhe season. was ex-
perience. in the pre-scason. tlic
Daiics' strong point was said to lie
in their veterans. anti now it has
ctitiglit on to the rest of the team.
With that experience has come a
toughness that enabled them to pull
otrt tin overtime \viii oit the road.

didn‘t fold." sttid Dicckeliiitin.
“And when we lost our two guards,
we didn't fold either. We were

J. V. Danes Play Catch-Up; Split Tloo For Week

by Marc Haspel

Fairing behind early has become a
trademark of the Albany State
junior varsity basketball team. Op-
ponents have jumped all over the
Danes in the ﬁrst half. making them
rush and forcing them to play
catch-up basketball. Until recently,
though. mounting any comeback
seemed almost impossible for the
jayvees.

Lately. the Danes have been cat-
ching up and even dominating the
second half action. As a result,
Albany has won two of their last
four games. while just barely losing
another. Wednesday night. the J.V.
Danes beat Albany Business Col-
lege. 80-78. and Tuesday, Albany
narrowly lost to Hamilton College
at the Hamilton Athletic Center.
4442.

Two Danes who have contributed
greatly to Albany's success have
been Billy Everett and George Ar-
chiblc. Against ABC. Everett had a
season high 25 points. with 75 per-
cent shooting from the floor. Archi-
ble had seven points against the
Owls, with six assists. But it has
been his defensive exploits that have
made him a team leader. He pulled
down is rebounds in the Owl game

and blocked three crucial shots
against the Hamilton Continentals.
His main job is to help out on the
center and deny the ball
underneath.

With a relatively weak crop of
outside shooters, rebounding has
become the name of the game for
the Danes. according to Albany
.l.V. head basketball coach Rick
Skeel. Aside from Archible’s slew
of rebounds, Wilson Thomas pulled
down 13, forward Dean Graebell
had 10. and captain Bob Helbock
came up with nine. “We're a hell of
a rebounding team," said Skeel.

Although trailing by seven.
38-31. at halftime. the Danes ex-
ploded for 49 points in the second
half. in that half, the Danes were

very successful at the offense they .

play best -— the inside game. “We
were able to get the ball inside and
not have to rely only on outside
shooting." said Skeel. “Once we
make it defensive adjustment we
cart start to ritri ottr offense."

in the first half of the Hamilton
game, Albany did not get much op-
portunity to run its offense. The
Continentals controlled the tempo
throughout the ﬁrst half by getting
scoring power from their big 6-2

freshman Alan Sofcn. who had
eleven points. Defensively. the Con-
tiiientals used an effective zone that
forced Albany to mainly rely on
outside shooter Craig Kinns. who
hit three of his first four shots for
six points in the half. “My points
have been coming mainly in the ﬁrst
half. in the second half. i haven’t
been getting the ball in the hoop."
said Kintis.

With 4:38 showing on the clock.
Sofen stink the second of two free
throws raising Hamilton's total to

' 26 and giving them a 10-point lead.

But Danes came back on a bcaritiftrl
spinning move to the basket by
Mark Ford and two buckets by
Graebell to narrow the halftime
score to 26-22.

The tide was beginning to turn its

which resulted in Ford's jump shot

to bring the Duties within two
points.
After using a tittiii-to-innn

defense in the first half. the Duties
switched to a zone. Hamilton. led
by Steve Reynolds' (15 points) three
buckets. scored eight consecutive
