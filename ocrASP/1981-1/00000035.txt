Does the nematode Utilities, Too?

by Sue Smith

This is par! one of a two-part
feature on QU-catnpnx living. This
section deals with the search for an
apartment and what to look for in
an apartment before a lease is sign-
('(I. Part two will discuss how Infar-
Irish and manage an apartment once
you 're found one.

The process of finding an apart-
ment stritablc to one's needs and
securing tenant rights in the Albany
area is easy if correct measures are
followed. According to Off Carn-
pus Housing (Oct-l0) Director

é News FEATURE

__________._..
Frank Ureen there are “plenty of
good apartrtictils to rent for the fall
1981 semester from March tlirotrgli
May."

(ireen cvplaincd that the landlord
list. compiled by ()(‘llO to assist
students iri locating landlords. will
be available on March l. The list
cannot be distributed earlier
because landlords cannot legally
ask tenants if they are renewing
their leases until |)0 days before the
leases run out. “Most leases.“
(irccti explained. "run out in June.
tnakittg March 90 days before tltc
lease runs out." Also, if a list is
distribtrtcd too early. “the
landlords will be bombarded by
pltoric calls." he said.

Until the list is available (ircen
suggested that students "go
through friends and work otrt a
good deal. Most apartments are
passed down from good friends."

Apartment hunting is often dif-
fictrlt for students. Green said.
because “students have restrictions

 

such as a limited .budget and the
need to be within walking distance
of the bus routc." Off Campus
Association (OCA) Director. Mark
.Dunlca. sited other reasons as being
“two percent vacancy rate in tlic ci-
ty of Albany. it limited SUNYA bits
system. and the 60 percent tenant
rate iii the area."

Because of the high student dc:
nianrl for off-campus housing. said
Green. students are at a disadvan-
tagc iti negotiations for a "decent"
apartment. “The landlord knows
the students want to live there and
figures 'l'vc got him'." He explain-
ed that most students put tip with
inadequate housing because they
feel they cart tolerate the poor cori-
ditions for the brief tiriic they re-
main irt school.

SA- Attorney .lack Lester feels
sttrdeiits should overcome that at-
titude. One way to secure tenant
rigltts is to obtain the Form Lease
of the New York State Consumer
Protection Board in lieti of the lease
the landlord may use because many
of the landlords' leases contain ll-
lcgal clauses. explained Lester.

“The first rnajor‘probleni in off-
earnpus living is signing a lease and
making sure it is' agreeable to both
tenant and landlord.“ said Green
Green added that ()(‘H() will
review the lease with students arid
decide whether or not it is a fair one
that allows students to “negotiate
with their landlords.“ A logbook
recording strident complaints about
landlords is kept in the OCHO.

Before signing a tease. strident
tenants should inspect the t‘rpart-
merits thoroughly. deciding if any
improvements are needed. “It is'im-
pcrative that these things be written

in the lease." said Green. “ An ad-
dcndtirn cart be attached at the end
of the lease stating what nccds to be
done. and by what date."

lnliibitcd examiners. according to
Green. must have the attitude that.
“They're not doing you any favor.
You‘re paying a lot of money. It‘s
an even exchange.

Although it varies. Green said.
“the average reirt per/person
per/month is SI 10 plus utilities. To
keep utilities as low as possible he
suggested looking for “good storm
windows. gas treating (with electric
and oil following lit the order of
cost). doors that close tightly. and
exposure (to the sun)."

Dunlea advised that students
check out the tttilily rates frorn the
prc\ions year to estimate your own
bills.

(ir'ccn also recommended that
students check the apartmcnls'
water pressure by “hurting on the
faucets lit the kitchen and
bathroom. flushing tltc ,toilcts. ll||~
rtirig on the shower. Look for scrat-
ches on the floors and walls."

Lester added that students should
check for “unsafe locks and win-
dows. paint peeling. roaclt and to-
dcrit infestation. or anything that
impairs health. safety. or welfare."

"Il' thc improvements are not
done by the date on the lease. you
can break the contract.“ said
(ircen. “This is a loophole to get
otrt of the apartment. However. it
should be used to gairi satisfac-
lion.“

“The first thing we advise is cort-
tintioirs communication. letting the
landlord know the problem in ad-
sartce. if the problem is put off.
write a letter. dating and signing it.

Keep a copy of it for yourself in
case you ever need to go to a small
claims court. _Vcry often a letter is
enough for the landlord to start ac-
tion," Grccn explained.

“If he still refuses." said Lester
of repair or condition problems.
“write (I letter to the Custody Code
[Enforcement llriremi and have tltcm
inspect the property so they can
document defects."

If these negotiations do not prove
fruitful. Lester said. “the correct
procedure is to withhold rent and
let the landlord take you to small
claims corrrt. This puts you at the
advantage because it gises the
landlord the ittcettthc to make
repairs. The tenant should come to
court with the rent money as a show
of good faith that they're willing to

pay the rent." .
in the case of ' an absentee
landlord. the agent is responsible in
lleu of the landlord to take care of '
the situation. However.,forcing the
landlord to initiate action in a small
claims court will guarantee the
landlord's attention. r r

 

Tenants sharing the same apart-
tncnt have a legal obligation to one
another. Lester suggested that
"students should have a written
agréemcnt amongst themselves
specifying all agreements. Plioch
bills should be itemized. They
should write down the addresses of
where they are going after the
rcsidency.‘_' if the financial
agreements are unresolved. tenants
could rise this doctrmeni to collect
in a smachlaims court. he said.

O(‘H() will hold information ses-
sions relrrtirtg to off-campus living
in late February. according to
Green.
