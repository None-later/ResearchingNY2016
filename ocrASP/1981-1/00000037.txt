if you're looking for something a
bit different in the way oftt place to
live. how about an underground

condominium?

 

 

America's ﬁrst underground con—
do — consisting of 266 windowless
residences buried ttndcr reinforced
concrete and tlu'ce-and-a-ltalf feet
of earth — is under construction itt
a place called La Vcrkiu. Utah.

The bttilder of these “low-rise"
units is a company called Survive
Tomorrow. lncorporated: and the
firm says the dcvcloptnettt is design»
ed to enable its residents to survive
a nuclear war.

The main entrance to La Verkin's
condos will ltave its own radiation
decontamination chamber. And
each living unit reportedly will have
enough dried and canned food to
feed a person for at least fottr years.
The builders say that all the air and

 

water inside will be ﬁltered for
radiation. as well as chemicals and
biological pollution.

in case you're interested. a unit
with two bedroom and one-and-a-
half baths sells for $78,000 dollars.
a price that includes that four year
supply of food.

Poor babies

The weekly allowance given by
parents to their children has become
a casualty of inflation.

Dr. Francis Roberts. the Director
of tire Elementary and Secondary
School Programs for tire National
Endowment for the Humanities.
claitns that most allowances today
don't amount to a hill of beans itt
terms of purchasing power.

' 1'.

Roberts says. however. that all is
not lost. He says that an allowance
that buys almost nothing is a great
way for kids to learn about infla-
tion first-hand. Roberts suggests
that when a child complains that his
or her allowance is too small to buy
anything — in his words ——
"Discuss sortie of the causes of in-
flation. Children like to know why
their parents are upset."

the nose knows

The state of Nevada’s drug-
sniffing Labrador, a dog named
"Jesse James." recently got the
chance to show off his skills to a
State Assembly Committee.

Unfortunately. ’Jesse suffered
front tr hit of state fright. With all
the legislators watching him. the
dog —— instead of sniffing out the
hidden dope in the room —- threw
up all over the committee room
floor.

 

.lcssc. however. then got his act
together. He managed to sniff out it
packet of marijuana. heroin. co-
caine and amphetamines that had
been tttpcd under a chair in the
room.

The State Department of Law
Enforcement says that. in spite of
that queasy stomach. Jesse ltas
helped police bust 44 people dttring
tltc past three weeks.

New York's Radio City Music
Hall has filed suit against The
Grateful Dead. seeking to prevent
the rock group from releasing a
video disc of one of its pcrfor»
mances in the music hall last year.

The tnttsie ltall claims that the
video recording in question con-
tains references to illicit drug use
and .cx. and that the disc‘s release
woul be damaging to the music
hall's reputation.

The tnusic hall is also objecting to

a poster released by The Grateful
Dead to promote the video disc.
The poster shows the group's
trademark, a skeleton, leaning
against the outside wall of the music
hall. The auditorium's management
claims that the poster suggests that
the financially-troubled music hall
is dying.

According to the suit. the video
disc contains “Assertions that illicit
drugs were available at the music
hall, references to bad cocaine con-
sisting of crushed mothballs and
glass . . . and assertions that urine
laced with LSD was available at the
music hall."

The suit seeks $1.25 tnillion
(dollars) in damages. plus destruc-
tion of the Dead poster and a ban
on the video disc.

dozen were named to mid-level staff
jobs. A total of 200 sub-cabinet

cabinet departments, as well as ap-
pointing a record number of women
to other government posts.

One unidentiﬁed female Reagan
supporter told Knight-Ridder News
Service, "This is the ﬁrst time in
history an administration has gone
backward. The best jobs are now
taken. I'll bet that women won’t get
more than l5 out of those 200
jobs."

The Carter Administration claim-
.ctl that 22 percent of its top up -
pointments went to women. up
from 13 per cent claimed by the
Ford Administration.

best (1’) for job

Maybe today's college students
aren‘t more conservative after all.

A survey conducted by the
University of California in Los
Angclcs and tire American Council
on Education has found that more
yottrtg women titan ever before are
considering traditionally male
careers.

The ('ltit'ugn Tribune reports that

'tuorc than one woman in four. or

27.2 percent. are planning a career
itt business. rttcdicinc. engineering.
or lttw. topping last year‘s- high of
25.9 percent.

The study found that the career
trends are apparently supported by
changes in student' attitudes toward
women's roles. When questioned if
students believed “women should
receive the same salary and oppor-
tunities for advancement as men."
93.3 per cent of the students
surveyed said "yes." in l97(). only
til.3 per cent of the students asked

 

that same question agreed.

T"e traditional idea that “the ac-
tivitit-s of married women are best
confined to thc home and family”
received less support than in
previous years. with only 26.6 per
cent of the students agreeing. down
from 47.8 per cent in l970.

SUNYA Secedes

continued from from page
trustecs' meeting Wednesday.

Levy said that the California
public school system was chosen as
a model system because "they have
tradi'ionally kept tuition as low as
possible while providing quality
education."

Although the secession is only a
symbolic gcsturc, SA President Sue
Gold said that the event will
“highlight” the issue of rising tui-
tion costs and continued budget
cuts.

Stern said that rising public
education costs will cause a “great
_outward migration of students"

 

' from New York which will “hurt

the state . . . more than anything
else." Stern believes that New York
college-age students will fittd atten-
ding statc colleges out of New York
cheaper than a SUNY education.

SASU officials. as well as Albany'
'Student Union and SA leaders. will
lprcside over the ceremony.
