Chgnets Give

Run For The Money“

by Larry Kuhn '

They were the smallest team
represented at the Vassar invita-
tional. but the Albany State syn-
chronized swimming team gave
everybody a run for their money.
Albany placed third. onc poinl
behind both Smith and Wheaton
Colleges in a first-place tie with 17
points. Vassar had 13 points and
Hunter failed to score.

“I think they did very well,” said
Albany synchronized swimming
coach Pat Regers. “l'm not pleased
that we lost. but i think we did the
best we could.”

The Cygnets brought only eight
swimmers. but still could have won
the meet. Team captain Tammy
Neil placed behind the only other
competitor at the senior level - an
independent from Russell Sage. The

. additional points there would have

been enough to push Albany over

" the top.

Top finishers for Albany were

‘ Hockey All-Stars

Face Off Tonight

Calif. (AP)
Ncithcr team will lack incentive
Tuesday night when the Prince of
Wales and Clarence Campbell con-
ferences square off in the 33rd Na-
tional Hockey League All-Star

V Game.

The Wales team will be coached
by Scotty Bowman. who guided the
Buffalo Sabres to the best record in
the conference last season. Bowman
has since rclinquishcd Sabres
coaching duties to Roger Neilson

'and serves as general manager of
.;.;the club. This game will be his last
'm. as a coach.

And the Campbell Conference
has never won an All-Star contest
played under tltc inter-conference
format —— the Campbells are 0-5.

“I’m looking forward to it." said
Bowman. who steered the Montreal
Canadicns to five Stanley Cup

_' championships and has a 4-2-1

record coaching in All-Star games.
“i hope it will result in a win to cap
that part of my career."

Teams ‘

France Myung. who placed third at
the junior level in a field of 11, and
Nancy Carroll. who did likewise at
the novice level in a ﬁeld of 32.

-“l was very pleased with Nancy.
particularly. She should move up to
the junior level for the Easterns."
commented Rogers.

Cathy Bcrdinka placed low at her
level. but according to Rogers, she
would have placed higher had it not
been for a mistake in her last ﬁgure
which dropped her down in the
standings. Amy Hevcron also per-
formed wcll. placing ninth as a
novtce. '

This Saturday the Cygnets host
the Routine invitational in Univer-
sity Pool at 9:00. it is their first
routine meet of the year.

“We are stronger pointwise. at
the moment. in ﬁgures because we
don't have a lot of swimmers.
Numbers is definitely a plus in
routines. but 1 think we‘ll do well."
Rogers said.

Two Losses For Dane Gymnasts

by Gail Goldsteln

This past weekend the women‘s
gymnastics team was on the road
and competed against Brockporl
and Canisius. They lost both meets.
although there were many fine per-
formances for Albany.

On Saturday. the Danes traveled
to Buffalo to meet Division II
Canisius. Herc. the competition

was close. but Albany got edged out '

of a victory by a score of 98.9 to
97.4.

Elainc Glynn. who ltas been kept
from the vaulting competition and
floor cxcrciscs dttc to a sprained
back, vaulted for thc first time in
weeks. She performed a yamashito
vault and scored a 7.65.

On the uneven bars. Glynn and

senior Barb Shaw both did fine
routines and ticd for first place with
a 6.5. Second place was awarded to
Elicia Slcinbcrg with a 5.9.

Steinbcrg also received second
place on the beam with a score of
6.4. in this routine. she performed
two back-handsprings. She is cur-
rently working on her back sotncr-
snult to be able lo perform it in the
upcoming Slate ntcct. Stcinbcrg
also earned first place in the all-
around with a scorc of 25.45 (just
.55 away from qualifying for the
prestigious Eastern Champion-
ships).

On Friday night. Albany lost to
Brockport by a score of l05.58‘ to
94:65. As usual. the uneven bars

event was the highlight of the com-
petition. Albany obtained a score of
21.0. just behind Brockport's 22.0.
Carlene Fcraco took ﬁrst place for
Brockport in the event. scoring
6.65, and Glynn took second with a
score of 6.55.

On the balance beam. two Dane
gymnasts fared well. Glynn scored
5.95, and Ann Salsmcycr reached
5.85.

In the all-around competition.
Steinbcrg attained a score of 24.55
and placcd third. ,

The Dunc gymnasts will compete
again tomorrow at Westficld and
again on Saturday at home in a tri-
mcct versus Division l Hofstra and
Division II University of Connec-
tlcut.

Mén swimmers 2....”

Sometimes after an emotional
loss a team suffers a letdown and
just can't muster the HO pcrccnt
necessary to overcome a tough op-
poncnt. Last week, the Albany
Sitttc men‘s swimming tcam suf-
fcrcd such a dcl'cat at the hands of
Capital District rival RH. and whcn
they met SUNYAC power Cortland
on Saturday at Cortland. the com-
bination proved to be lethal.

Cortland. who. along with
Potsdam. sit atop the SUNYAC.
rompcd over the 3-5 Danes with lit—
llc trouble at all. 78-35.

“My general feeling as a whole is
that our team has a tendency to not
be extremely hungry when we're go-
ing up against a sii'ongcr team." ad-
mitted Albany swimming coach
Ron White. White also suggested
that the RH loss may have been a
contributing factor in the team's
performance.

The Red Dragons. eager to
qualify people for the Nationals.
stacked the deck against Albany by
placing their top swimmers in the
relays.

two relays to qualify for the Na-
tionals — the 400-yard Freestyle
Relay and the 400-yard Medley
Relay." said White. “We didn't
have a chance til cithcr — but that
was their strategy. just to go for two
good rclnys."

Kevin Ahcrn highlighted the meet
for Albany with three good times.
including a 0:58.48 split in the
400-yard Freestyle Relay. Ahcrn
also picked up Albany’s only ﬁrst
place finish. winning the loo-yard
Freestyle with a time of 0:58.4.

Other good performances for the
Danes were turned in by Jim Col-
gan. Kerry Donovan. Ed Pierce.
Stcvc Bonawitz and Joe Shore. Col-
gan turned in a time of l2:18 in the
l000-yard Freestyle. good enough
for a second place ﬁnish in an event
he rarely attempts.

Donovan also had a second place
showing. his in the 200~yard.
Freestyle in just over two minutes.
with Pierce clocking in three
seconds later in third.

Bonawitz swam a good 100vyard
Backstroke in his leg of the
400-yard Medley Relay (0:58.7) and
Shore turned in a 0:57.8 timing in
the loo-yard Butterfly.

The swimmers travel to New
