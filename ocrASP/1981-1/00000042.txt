split this weeken

 by Michael Carmen
Andrew Seras became the second
winningest wrestler in Albany State
history as the Danes split a dual
meet versus Coast Guard and RH.
' in the Uttiversity Gym Saturday
fternoon.
Albany State defeated RPl 33-l9.
‘nd fell at the hands of Coast Guard
8-l2, but the key story was Seras.
~ Vi Seras entered the event sporting a

315-0 record. When he stepped on
the mat against Coast Guard‘s en-
-’try, all eyes were on the i42-pound
eight class match. Seras and Ted
Harrup wrestled to the ﬁnish and
when tlte points were tallied, they
were tied at 12 points each. The
‘ match was called a draw and Seras’
winning streak had been hailed at
15 straight.
in the later match against RPl,
Seras regained his winning style and
‘ defeated the opposing wrestler by a
fall at 3:59 of the match.

Albany State also had strong per-
formances in the RPl match by Bill
Endres, Vic Herman and Tim
McGowen. Endres, who beat RPl’s
Bob Baker on a 5-3 decision. also
took a decision in the earlier match

against Coast Guard. Herman was
another double winner as he pinned
Coast Guard's l77-pounder at 2:27
of the match.

Albany will now take a disap-
pointing 7-13 record into the
SUNYAC Tournament this Friday
and Saturday. “it was a disappoin-
ting season. We could have done
much better without all the injuries.
We just need everyone healthy,"
stated Dane wrestling coach Joe
DcMeo.

The Danes‘ injury problems have
caused wrestlers such as Endres and
Bill Papazian. who normally com-
pete at 142 pounds, to wrestle out-
side of their most comfortable
class.

DeMeo claims that Albany
wrestlers faced one of the tougher
schedules of any Dane team. The
record speaks for itself as the grap-
piers faced four Division 1 schools,
including third-ranked Syracuse
University. three Division II schools
and six Division lll teams ranked in
the top ten.

The coach does see several bright
spots in a poor season. “Our team
is very young and all our wrestlers

_v Women Cagers Recuperate By Splitting A Pair

by Lori Cohen

The Albany State women's
basketball team faced two extreme-
ly close ball games this weekend,
coming out with opposite results.
Thursday they squandered a
iO-polnt lead in losing to Bingham-
ton. 60-56. Then Saturday night,
hosting an inspired Skidmore five,
the women managed to stay in con-
trol and win, 60-53. Both games
showed a Dane team well on the
way to recuperation after a period
of apathetic play. Albany's record
is now 4-9.

In both games. it was Lynne Bur-
ton and Luanne LaLondc who were
the main contributors, with
LaLondc picking up some of the
slack left by the ill Nancy Halloran.
“Luannc played beautifully. She re-
bounded well and played ag-
gressively. while maintaining ltcr
control," Albany women's basket-
ball coach Amy Kidder said. “At
the end of the Skidmore game, we
looked to Lynne and she did it all.
very well — clutch play on her part.

The Skidmore game sec-sawed
until, with 2:50 left in the first half.
Albany reclcd off six unanswered
baskets. They headed into the
locker room 30-24 leader's. Burton
and Lal.ondc had 10 points apiece.
Kidder. obviously pleased with her
team‘s first half performance.
“wanted some adjustments on our
man-to-man. Otherwise we are

are returning next season. We also
faced an extremely tough schedule.
You can't expect to beat Syracuse.
It would be like our basketball team
taking on Notre Dame. Against
Syracuse we actually took one
match and would have taken
another if Herman didn’t bang his
head at the end of the match."
commented DcMeo.

However. no one is making ex.-
cuses for the Danes' record. The se-
cond season starts at the SUNYAC
Tournament. hosted by the defen-
ding NCAA champion Brockport.
attd DeMco is hoping to qualify one
or two wrestlers into the NCAA
tournament. The coach wouldn't
mention his favorites: “That‘s for
tltcm to decide," explained DcMeo.

The Danes have their work cut
out for them since the SUNY con—

playing well."

However. foul trouble set in as
both of Albany's big women got
four fouls within the ﬁrst four
minutes of the second half. With
LaLondc and Eileen Fatchcric on
the beach. the Albany offense'lack-
ed rebounding.

The teams remained within two
points until LaLonde checked in at
8137. Along with Burton, she open-
ed up the lead to six. At 6:47
LaLonde received her fifth foul and
was forced to the bench early.

But. as usually happens, other
players filled the void. Carol
Wallace, running the offense in a
fast-paced, quick moving style.
gave Albany the edge it needed to
wm.

Burton finished with itl points
and eight rebounds. while Lal..ondc
had 18 points and 19 rebounds.

“We really held up under the
pressure at the end. We came
through when it really counted."
Kidder reflected.

The Binghatnton game was
played in the snare fashion. with a
different ending. Albany‘s man-to—
man. again. playing excellently.
With the score 22-l3. Burton and
Fateheric picked up their third
fouls. The half ended with Albany
holding a shaky 26-2] advantage.
after leading 26-16. Burton had it
points and i0 rebounds. while

LaLonde had it rebounds and
three blocked shots, and stood out
defensively.

The second half began the way
the first ended, with Binghamton
creeping up behind Albany, chipp-
ing away at their lead. At 13:34,
LaLonde was called for a foul
underneath, and appeared to say
nothing. yet she was charged with a
technical foul. Binghamton hit all
three free throws and went into the
lead. to stay, 36-35.

Several times the Danes came
within one point — twice after Bur-
ton hit pairs of foul shots, but they
could not overtake the pumped-up
Bingltamton women. Albany's full
court press worked well. causing
numerous jump balls. almost all of
which Binghamton won.

With the score 54-51 at 2:10, a
turnover leading to a Binghamton
basket showed the beginnings of an
Albany defeat. Wallace and Bur-
ton, each playing with four fouls.
gave it all they could, arid still the
buzzer sounded with the Danes los-
ing. 60-56. Burton finished with 26
points and 14 rebounds. Wallace it
points, and L'tLonde had 15 re-
bounds and four blocked shots.

Both games were exciting and
showed a revived Albany team.
"We are well on our way to
recovery." said Kidder. “All our
games are going to be this ex-
citing."

fercnce is the toughest in the nation.
Forty-one competitors will qualify
for the national tourney.

Albany State has qualiﬁed two
athletes in each of the previous two

years. DeMeo thinks that the Home
mat advantage for Brockpo ‘t is
very significant in this event and his
attitude on winning' is basically sim-
ple: “i can just keep my fingers
crossed."

J. V. Danes Lose To Tough JCA

by Marc Haspel

Perhaps facing their toughest
competition of the season, the
Albany State junior varsity basket-
ball team dropped their ninth loss
to the Junior College of Albany
84-63.

Two factors beset the Danes at
the start. First. JCA is regarded as
an excellent junior college ball club.
They are well on their way to post-
season play, according to Albany
J.V. head coach Rick Skeel.

“They can put out ﬁve or six
guys that are better than any players
We got," Skeet explained.

Second. the jayvces were without
the. services of Wilson Thomas, who
was playing with the varsity for the
day in i’otsdaui. Because of
'l‘hotnas’ absenco, Skeet was forced
to use his big men at the post posi-
tions. upsetting his normal match-

5.
Nonetheless, it was a typical
'Jayvce loss. The Danes fell behind

in the first half and had only to try
to mount a comeback in the second.

The first half was all JCA. They
were driving and shooting on
Albany at will. while at the same
time maintaining a slow pace. At
halftime, JCA led 37—20.

Meanwhile. the Danes were ac-
cumulating fouls. The fouls took
their toll later in the game as Dane
George Archible fouled out and
every other starter was at some
point forced to the bench in foul
trouble.

in the second half, Albany came
alive, nearly playing JCA point per
point. In fact, the Danes got within
eight points, and “made them work
very hard in the second half," said
Skeel. “We got it into a running
game and got back within eight.”

But this time the Danes' efforts
could not make up the difference as
they fell to the eventual 21-point
loss.

Aside from Billy Everett's
i4-point performance. two other
Danes. Bill Reilly and George Bur-
roughs, had excellent games. Reilly
contributed 15 points to the Dane
cause.

“Bill (Reilly) got his shooting eye
on, he‘s a good shooter and a good
zone breaker," said Skeel. “if you
leave him open, he can beat you."

Burroughs. a player who has sat
and watched for the most part of
this season, added l4 points of his
own. but he was widely praised for
his outstanding passing game at the
guard position.

“He had eyes in the back of his
head. His passing alone accounted
for twenty points. Here's a guy who
hasn't played all year and still
played unselﬁshly," said Skeel.

O 0 t

The 4-9 J.V. Danes travel across
the river Thursday to play a
rematch against RPl as the
preliminary to the varsity game.
