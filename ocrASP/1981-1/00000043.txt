Jachim’s 19 Points Leads Bears
Over Poor Shooting Albany, 64-53

by Bob Bellafiore

POTSDAM — With starter Pete

Stanish back in Albany with the flu.

the Albany State basketball team

had to try a little harder against the
ﬁfth-ranked Division 111 team in
the nation.

Potsdam had recently suffered its
only blemish to their season ~— a
one point loss to St. Lawrence. and
was looking to solidify their top
position in the SUNYAC —- a spot
challenged only by the Danes.

But without their quickest player
and best penetrator. Albany could
not apply enough offensive
pressure, weren't able to set up
quickly enouglt on defense to
negate Potsdam's fast break attack.
and the Bears defeated the Danes.
64-53. in front of a capacity crowd
in Potsdam's Maxcy Hall Saturday
afternoon. snapping Albany's nine-
game winning streak.

“Everyone had to do a little
more." said Albany head basket-
ball coach Dick Sauers. whose
Danes have dropped three in a row
(four of the last five) to arch-rival
Potsdam. “1 think my team was
capable of winning the game
without Stanish (42 points in his last
two games). Yott can‘t trsc that as
an excuse."

Still. the loss oI'Stnnislt was more
than noticeable. Albany. unable to
score inside. was forced to rely on
matching halves of 10 for 30

shooting. Once Potsdam got the
lead with 12 minutes remaining in
the first half. they switched to their
1-3-1 zone. and controlled Albany's
ineffective offense

“We've shot that way before and

won. but they know they’re down.
and they take a shot a little earlier."
Sauers said. “They get anxious.

"i didn't think we played a smart
game offensively." he continued.

Meanwhile, Potsdam's running
game exploded for big scoring
streaks on two occasions. With
Albany ahead 17-15 and 8:17 to go
in the ﬁrst half. the Bears reeled off
13 straight points. and held the
Danes scoreless for 4:17. taking a
28-17 lead.

The Danes. down 31-22 at
halftime. opened the second half
with three straight baskets on jump
shots by .lohn Dicckelman (11
points) and Mike Gatto (six points).
and a bank shot by guard Ray
Cesare (11 points) — all within the
first two minutes. in that time. the
Bears committed two turnovers.
and Albany cut the lead to three.
31-28. '

After a time ottt. a dtrnk by
Potsdam‘s All-American ccrtlcr
Derrick Rowland pttt an end to the
Albany rally. nttd igrritctl a 23-11 tear
that opened the near lend to 54-16.
with 6:20 to go. “That changed the
game." said Saucrs.

Potsdarn'went into their “four to

score" delay offense. and the Danes
never had a chance.

"That's a big lead with a long
time to go.” Sauers said. “We just
don't have the quickness to defend
against it that long."

“At halftime. we felt tlrat they
were tired. and we wanted to pick
up the pace early in the second half.
and then stall into the four cor-
ners." said Potsdam guard Ed
.lachim. a two-time SUNYAC
player of the year.

erilc Albany had more than
their share of shooting troubles.
Potsdam. led by a sizzling Jachim
(seven of eight from the ﬂoor. game
high 19 points) hit on 24 of41 shots
(58.5 percent). and controlled the
tempo throughout the game.

"We began‘ to run our offense."
said Potsdam head basketball coach
Jerry Welsh. who was not surprised
about the ease of his team's victory.
“We just played really well in the
second half when we 'had to. i
thought we were going to win
because we were ready."

The game was a must for the
Danes if they entertained any hopes
of hosting the SUNYAC Tourna-
ment on February 27 and 28. which
will be held at the court of the
Eastern Division winner. Potsdam
ttow 5-0 lit the conference (lit-1
overall) sits cotnfortably atop that
division. with Albany second (4-2 in
the conference. 14-3 overall). With

Saturday's win. it appears that tltc
tournament will most likely be held
at Potsdam.

But while the Bears were concern-
cd about where the tournament is
going to be played. Saucrs has his
mind on getting there now.

“This was a big game." Strucrs
said. "if we won, we cottld‘vc

hosted. but now we‘ve got to work
to get into the SUNYACs.“

Albany will try to get back on the
winning track tonight against

Trackmen Perform In The Clutch AtRPIMcct

by Jim Markotsis

“A clutclt performance" is how
Albany men's track and field coach
Bob Mttns‘cy described Saturday's
victories over Rl’l and Hudson
Valley Community College at Rl’l.
Albany's first place finish improved
the team's record to 6-3 for the
season.

The best performance of the meet
was awarded to Tony Ferrctti. who
surged past a strong RPl opponent
with a strong ﬁnish in the SOD-meter
run. His time of 1108.7 was less than
a half-second off titnc l‘icldhor c
record.

Ferretti followed this swift per-
formance with a startling come-
from-behind victory as be anchored
the l600-meter relay team. Each
member of that victorious relay
team had a successful afternoon as
junior Pete Passidomo took second
in the 400 meters. Howie Williams
took second in the 50-meter dash.
and senior Paul Eichelbergcr took
second in the SOD-meter run.

The hurdlers came through with a
perfect effort for the second week
in a row with Mitch Harvard
(undefeated on the season) taking
first, followed by fellow hurdlers
Steve Decker and Brian Ragule.

The 400-meter run was a pro-
sperous event for the Danes as they

scored heavily with Alvin Ferguson
leading the way. nosing our
l’trssidomo for first place. .s'mtt
Sachs was also effective as he came

Scott James had a magnificent
day as ire emerged triumphant in
both his events. the 1500-metcr and
1000-mcter runs. Jim Roth also
scored itt the ltXX) as he crossed the
finish litre irt third place.

Bruce Shapiro turned in yet
another excellent performance for
the Danes. Shapiro won the
BOO-meter rrtn and ran the opening
leg for the triumphant 3200-metcr
relay squad.

"He's a gutsy kid. lte gives it
everything he's got." said Munsey.

Todd Silva was also a member of
that relay team and he scored for
the Danes again in tire 3000-t'nctcrs
with a second place finish.

The field events were not as suc-
cessful as the running events. Yet.
Dan Kennedy vaulted well cnottglt
to capture ﬁrst place and freshman
Brian Ragule finished third in the
pole vault. Junior Tint Guntltcr
placed fourth in the triple jump.
Munsey calls Gttntltcr “the type of
kid who works his butt off. and
always manages to get us sonic
pornts."

Another jumper. Bruce Briggs.
failed to place because of an ankle
injury sustained at the tnect. it does
not appear to be serious. and he
should be ready for this Saturday’s
meet 111 Union College.

"The clrrtch kids." as Munscy
called his squad. “came through.

They've got me terribly thrilled."

lie is. however. maintaining his
position as head coach of football.

The resignation will become cf-

'l‘ltc main reason for his stepping

Since then. Albany has had suc-

Although Fortl called this merely
a "yardstick" of his team‘s success
which cannot be viewed as the sole
indication of a decline in the foot-

by the trustees. will‘ raise
undergraduate tuition front tire cur

as of this fall.

The executive contrttittcc of tire
Board of Trustees, which asked
Wharton last month to consider at

ton‘s rccommcntlation shortly after
ltc announced it. The frrll board is

According to Wharton. SASU’s
charges against SUNY are “without

SUNYA “Secedes” from N .Y.

Joins California System

by Mindy Saftlla

The State University of New
York at Albany will hence be
known as the State Uttiversity of
California at Albany as a result of a
symbolic "secession" from New
York's ptrblic university system. ac-
cording to Student Association of
the State University (SASU) Presi-
dent .|im Stern.

A secession ceremony was held
yesterday in tire Campus Center to
protest a proposed $150 tuition irr-
crease.

“SUNY is not low cost
anymore." Stern said. “One month
ago. itr preparing this. we thought
we were just protesting Governor
(.‘ar‘cy. but now otu own trustees
want a trritiott incrcrrsc. They are
afraid of the (inventor and of going
to the legislature for additional
money.

“As it result of the increase.
students may be forced to leave the
state." Stertr continued. “Students

will go to private schools. and New
York State will lose futttre tax-
payers."

According to a Student Associa-
tion (SA) press release. SUNY
Chancellor Clifton Wharton Jr.
and the Board of Trustees are ask--
ing Governor Hugh L. Carey to
submit a bttdgct amendment to
authorize a tuition increase. This in-
crease would drivc the cost of a
SUNY education above $4000. the
release stated.

SA President Sue Gold said “in
the past New York State has had
one of the fittest public education
systems iii the country. Uttfor-
tunately. in tire past few years we
have seen support for SUNY
decrease because of inadequate fttrr-
ding. ttrculty turd program rctrertch-
merit turd rising costs.

“Students will not tolerate this.“
Gold said. "Therefore. we rnttst go
to California where a high qtrality
low cost education is the priority."

 

California State College and
University Student Association
Chair Nancy MacFadden said."We
are pleased with the acquisition of
the scccding SUNY schools. We will
continue orrr tradition of high
quality. low cost public education
for all the schools now in our
system."

tudcnt Union Chair .lim Tierney
noted that “in 1980 we would have
lost 106 SUNYA faculty members.
bttt students fought back. We won
tlten. anti we're going to do it
