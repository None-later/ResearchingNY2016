Tuition Increase

continued from front page

tuition has gone up since l‘)72. the
proportionate share of costs borne
by students has actually declined
nearly two percentage poittts.

Wharton cstirttated tltat his pro-

- posed ltikc will generate a revenue
increase ol' more than $20 million.
the money will be used, he said. to
ol't‘sct some of the reductions pro-
ttusctl Ill timernor (‘arey's budget.

Specifically. tltc additional $20
million will be allocated to:

- Rustitl‘c 4()l of 442 faculty and
staff positions proposed to be
eliminated

- increase lands for equipment
and building repair

' lzlirninate proposed rental
chances for Residence Assistants
(ILAA)

- Partially restore tuition wnvers

Wharton crrtpltasi/ed. however,
that tile additional $20 million does
not completely cover the $57
million difference between SUNY‘s
original budget request and (iover-
rtor (‘arcy's proposals.

According to Vice (‘hattcellor for
Business artd Finance Harold
Spindlet. the trustees tnrrst raise tui-

effort to increase SUNY‘s budget
later. itt order to secure the direct
support of Governor Carey.

“Public lands are tight." said
Spindler. “The Governor has to
send an amended budget proposal
to the legislature in less than thirty
days. II' we don‘t make concessions
and try to work with him ttowI we
might rtot get a cltturce iii the
future.

"We can't at'l‘ord to make
enctrrics with anyone," Spindlcr ad-
ded.

Board Chairman Donald lilinkcn
said he supported the tuition trike
proposal “with regret." Other
trustees present at the meeting were
somewhat less sympathetic.

Trustee Jeanne ‘i'hayer told

. students assembled at the meeting

that "the board will do what has to
be done." She asked. "How do
your parents feel about your miss-
ing classes to protest tuition
