Tclc‘phone Service is . Questioned]

by Bruce bevy

Although _the New York
Telephone company sent letters tol
SUNYA students last fall to answer
questions regarding the company,
several students still
about their telephone service.

Among the problems cited were
service cuts without notice. services
wrongly cut, oyer-biliings. lack of
choice in billing policy. and the
phone company‘s impersonal treat-
ment of students.

SA Attorney Jack Lester advised
students who are incorrectly billed
to withhold payment until it can be
straightened out with the phone
company. Additionally. students
who have service terminated
without notice can seek a court
order to force New York Telephone
to restore services.

If service is wrongly cur. Lester
added. students may also sue for
damages.

Many students. who wished to :e-

complain .

main anonytnous. said they felt
New York Telephone was taking
advantage of them because of their
student status.

"Dormitory service has always
been a problem." Chief Telephone
Technician of the Public Service
John Calcagni said.

A government agency set up to
regulate companies such as New
York Telephone. the Public Service
Commission can step in to ar-
bitrate between the company's
business representative and the con-
sumer. Calcagni said.

With regard to services cut.
Calcagni said the phone company
must send a disconnect notice
speciﬁcally warning that payment is
Overdue. threatening interruption,
and stating when it will take place.

Regarding the Complaint of im-
personal treatment, Calcagni said
that. if necessary. his office could
arrange a personal meeting with the
phone company to resolve the pro-

blem situations.

Calcagni further advised that the
phone company should give two
days’ credit to consumers for every
day service is wrongly cut.

New York Telephone's Albany
Manager Bob Stokes claims pay-
ment notice is always sent by com-
puter shortly after the due date.
Eight days are then alloted for
customer payment before service is
cut.

Stokes added that two attempts
are made to reach the customer by
phone.

In answer to student charges
about lack of choice in billing
policy. Stokes said only the
designated student plan is available
under the system installed by
SUNYA.

Under this system. only one stu-
dcnt per room or suite signs for
responsibility for the phone service.

However. there is also sortie
dispute as to wlto is responsible for

payment. Both Calcagni and Lester
said the designated student is held
responsible, but Stokes insisted that
the designated student is only under
obligation to tell the phone com-
pany the names of those who owe
money.

SA Attornei .ltit‘k Lester

Public Service Commission in-
formation officer I). Rivett stated
that when the telephone company
threatens to issue bad credit ratings.
it is only within that company;
names are not given to any credit
agencies.

Carter Act Declared Unconstitutional

DALLAS. Texas AP —— A federal
judge ruled Thursday that former
President Jimmy Carter acted llll-
constitutionally in nullifying all
court-ordered attachment. of
frozen Iranian funds. The rrrlirrg
could have broad implications for
the U.S.-lran accords that led to the
freeing of the 52 hostages.

U.S. District Judge Robert \\'.
Porter ruled in faxor of [Electronic
Data Systems Corp. iti tlic llhl ma»
jor challenge to Carter’s c\ccttti\c
order issued at the climax of thc

hostage crisis.

Porter issued a preliminary in-
junction blocking the transfer of
$20 million in lranian funds that

another judge had lTOlCll in a New ‘

York batik in June I979. hcl'ore tltc
hostage crisis began. The attach-
ment was ordered pending a court
judgment on EDS‘ breach of con-
tract suit against lrart.

Porter ruled that ('zirtcr‘s action.
which \\\'L‘[‘tl away court orders and
lawsuits by decree. was art
“unwarranted intrusion" into lllc

realm of the judicial branch of
government.

Justice Department lawyers are
known in hclicvc that thc EDS case
is unique among the 388 pending
lawsuits by American firms or in-
di\iduals seeking compensation
frottt lran. Unlike the test of the
cases. the EDS case had already
proceeded to a filial judgment
before the agreement was reached.

Bed Rest, Aspirin, andFluids 3.8.0.... 7.. 

by Dr. Janet Hood

Inﬂuenza is the name given a set
of symptoms caused by various
viruses which change every few
years or oftcner by a process of
mutation. That is why the vaccines
prepared to prevent occurrence of
the disease caused by the most
recently occuring strain are sudden-
ly less effective and in need of
replacement. “Hong Kong” ﬂu.
“Bangkok” or "swine" ﬂu. ctc..

are names deriving usually from the
location where the new strain is first
discovered to be causing illness -
or. as in “swine” ﬂu, from the vie.

tims first described.

Flu is characterized by sudden
onset of prostration (extreme
weakness). often by 'severe pain
behind the eyes and over the ﬂanks
in the back. generalized muscular
aches and pains. rapidly rising fever
(often to 102 degrees or even
higher), and respiratory symptoms.
Occasionally. with certain strains,
intestinal symptoms with vomiting
and diarrhea may be present.

Prompt bed rest, aspirin and
ﬂuids are the only treatment. In
otherwise healthy young adults ﬂu
usually runs its course in a few days.
lfa patient is growing worse instead
of a little better after 48 hours. and

symptoms and much coughing. one
suspects complications, particularly
pneumonia. While antibiotics and
such speciﬁc medications are inef-
fective in 'the treatment of un-
complicated ﬂu..there may be in-
dications for their use when such

 

complications exist; at that point
the patient should seek a physi-
cian’s assistance.

In individuals over 65 and those
of any age with a basic health pro-
blem such as severe asthma. em-

physema. diabetes. or kidney trou- '

ble ﬂu can create a life-threatening
problem. Such individuals should
have annual shots of the most up-
to-date type of ﬂu vaccine in an at-
tempt to prevent its occurrence.
These should be given early in the
autumn before the flu season.

One often hears horror stories of
the flu epidemic during World War
I when thousands of people died.
Driving by a large cemetery in Mon-
treal. Canada. where a whole sec-

tion is devoted to ﬂu victims of '

that period -- a great many of them
reported to have been young, preg-
nant women -— one gets the full im-
pact ofwhat must have been a terri-
fying experience at that time. Ac-

tually. however, it was not thlé‘flu
that‘krlled these people. it was com-
plications accompanying the ﬂu

.and for which in those days there

was no specific therapy such as to-
day’s antibiotics. Nor were there ef-
fective vaccines to put a brake on its
incidence. That is why in epidemics
today the mortality rate is not near-
ly as high as it was in the pre-
antibiotic era. ,

One other thing about ﬂu —
which professors need to recognize
on behalf of their students — is that
even an otherwise healthy young
adult who has had flu with no
special complications does not
bounce right back to normal.
Almost all virus diseases have a pro-
longed recovery period during
which the patient does not function
up to his normal level. Faculty who
have themselves endured the flu are
likely to he most sympathetic with
their students.
