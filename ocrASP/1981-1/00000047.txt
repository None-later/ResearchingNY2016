sick at heart

With Valentine’s Day coming, tip.
sweethearts apparently will not
have to worry about giving or get-
ting PCB's along witlt their heart
shaped boxes of chocolate.

Officials with the Federal Food
and Drug Administration say they
believe the candy industry has \‘ir-
tually wiped otrt the PCB problem
which cropped up for the first tirrrc
last Valentine‘s Day.

It was discovered just before
February mm of last year that the
paperboard used to make candy
specialty boxes was contaminated
with “polyclrlorinatcd biphctryls.“

tained levels of PCB's ten times
above the recommended maximum
allowable levels. '
The FDA says that tests this year
indicate that the candy being sold
this holiday is safe. PCB‘s have
been shown to catrsc liver damage
and sterility itr laboratory animals.

The Worldwatch Institute has
released a report on a promising
source of fuel that could Irclp soch

The fuel itr question is called . . .
“wood.”

According to the institute. the

The institute says that wood is an
ideal source of energy because
forests already cover one-quarter of
the earth's surface. and because it is
a source that is renewable.

corpse coiffures

Here's another “how to" book
that describes the tricks of the trade
of doing hair-do‘s  for dead
people.

Author and publisher Noella
l’apagno has been doing corpse
coiffures for years. and finally
decided to write her book to dispell
myths and aversions to her profes-
sion.

I’apagno had one problem: she
didn‘t know what to call her job.
Tire word "corpse" was too upset-
ting. "Necroeosmetologist" was
too ghoulish. and “hairdressing for
decedents" made people think her

,.

book would be about morally ques-I-

tionable hairdo’s.

Papagno ﬁnally made up her own
word. She took the letters “D-E-S"
from deceased. “A-l-R" from hair,
and added “OLOGY” to come up
with the title of her profession and
book: Desairology.

By the way. Papagno says she
loves her work. It seems her clients
never complain about how their
hairdo’s turn out.

strange sights

Sightings of UFO's have
reportedly been correlated with the
earth‘s seismic activity by a Cana-
dian psychologist.

Michael Pcrsinger of Laurentian
University in Srtdbury. Ontario,
reports finding a “significiant” rise
in UFO reports beginning approx-
imately six months before an earth-
quake irr scisrnically active areas in
botir the U.S. and Canada. Pers-
ingcr says that the UFO sightings
also fell off dramatically following
cartltqrrake activity.

sightings may actually be luminous
manifestations of seismic stress. He
explains that as geological strain
builds up. these luminous effects

.may be created by some still
. unknown natural process.

audible-mobile

The Datsun Motor Company has
come out with a car that talks —
but company officials stress that
they have carefully designed a car
that does not talk too much.

Drivers of the Datsun 810 will oc-
casionally hear a soft female voice
say something like "the oil pressure
is dropping," or “please turn off
the lights."

 

Datsun's' Product Development
Irrtrrragcr is Peter Harris: and Harris
says he was warned by a psychiatrist
about turning otrt an auto that ol-
I‘crs too trruch advice. Tire
psychiatrist stressed that the
automobile today is one of the last
bastions of solitude wh'erc
somebody can go to escape from
other people.

According to Harris. if a person
has a qrrarrcl with his or her spouse.
the last thing the driver will want is
to retreat into a car. only to hear it

begin nagging.

drafting practice

The U.S. Selective Service System
was denying last fall that iI had any
plans ltr‘ reinstitrrtc the military
tIiiIIl in the United States. lint art
than very moment. Sclcctir'c Scr'r rcc
(Hi'icinls \rcrc preparing.I draft
notices for 35.000 unsuspecting
young men whose names were
chosen by lottery.

The lottery in this case was only a
“practice.” however. The practice
was part ol’ The Department of
Defense's “Proud Spirit"
Mobilization l-Zxcrcise. carried out
by Ht) government and military
organizations.

 

 

 

Within 24 hours of "Proud
Spirit's" starting time on
No\cmber 6th. the selective Service
had reviewed its computerized list
of registrants. held a lottery. and
fed the names of the 35.000
“indtrctces"'who were selected into
a Western Uniotr computer.

That computer. in turn. would
have sent out mailgrants to the
35.000 young men. if the exercise
hadn't been stopped at this point.
The nrailgrams were sent. instead.
to 7l5 Military Reservists who had
been alerted in advance. '

How did it all go‘.’“‘Wc were
rather proud of our results." says
Dr. l-ier‘b Prrscheck. the agency's
Associate Director for Plans and
Operations. "The defense depart-
ment was assured that our system
works." 3;
