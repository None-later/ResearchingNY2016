On Campus Blues

To the Editor:

After learning about ilrc proposed $150
increase in room fees i thought to myscli‘. is
it really worth it to live on campus? We live
here at the most eight months a ycrrr turd by
dividing the $1100 board by these eight
months 1 come out with the figure $137.50
‘1' per month per person. That is an absurd
amount for the living conditions that wc are
provided with. Double that amount. you
and your rooninte are paying $275 a nronilr
for an eight foot by clcvcn foot room.

Turning to the heating. there are
radiators that are operated by opening and
closing a vent. If the vents are left open it
becomes unbcarably erI and if you close
the vent it feels like the North Pole.

What about lroi water? Whirl lioi Water!
in the morning there‘s no hot water. You
have to suffer through a cold slrowcr. For
the amount wc’rc paying thch should be
hot water.

And how about the cleaning service? Till:
cleaning womcn arc seen so infrequently
that it is a celebration when they do come.

Enough complaining. ilicrc ill‘c riiltcr‘
things wrong with suite living. brri ilrcic is it

ridiculous rate hike proposed by Chnnccllor

the required books.

1 myself would be lying ifl said 1 have at-
lcndcd all my classes over the years. To be
perfectly honest 1 have taken at least three
classes where l have only shown up to take
the midterm and tire final.

in reality 1 should be a booster for man-
datory altcndancc classes. The two classes 1
have taken when 1 was required to be sitting
in classes 1 received A's. ltrrt if these classes
did not require attendance 1 probably
wouldn‘t have gone half the time and 1 still
would have rcccivcd my A‘s.

So what can be done about the class ut-
lcndancc situation. Should all teachers rc-
qrrirc mandatory attendance? Should
teachers just give out a syllabus with illl.‘ rc-
quircd course reading and forch about
thcir lectures? '

Attending classes will probably always be
a mixed issue. There will always be students
who would have to bc kidnapped to miss a
class. and there will be thosc who will never
attend. I myself can say unless attendance is
definitely going to be checked. my mind
will question whether or not I should go to
:1 class. [Even if i go to a class 1'” usually
end up doing The New l'ork Timur

Never on Friday

We fecl that there is no question that Mayfest should be held
on Saturday, as it traditionally has been.

Mayfest is one of the most unifying days for this university. it
is not only for the current students; it is a day for alumni to
reunite and return to SUNYA.

We find the proposed Friday alternative unacceptable and
foolish.

As far as attendance is concerned, Friday might attract less of a
crowd. But just who are we limiting from the event? No, it won’t
limit the number of undesirablcs or underaged high school
students. it will, instead, dramatically reduce the number of
students’ friends and alumni who attend each year.

Mayfcst is not just a special day; it is an institution.

While Mayfcsi is not perfect, its problems are not without solu-
tions.

The first problem to focus on is security. SA will have to find
the additional monies necessary to provide extra security.

Another suggestion is to charge money for parking for non—
studcnis. This would help by raising additional money for sccuri-
ty and discouraging those who are not affiliated with SUNYA.

There are many complications with any new plan and it certain-
ly takes time to construct onc. SA has known about the problems
since last Mayl'csi. Why have they waited such a long time? Long
ago they should have sci rip plans and proposals to present to the
adminstration.

We hope tbch is still iimc. .

it would be a shame if poor planning and burcriucracy led to
the dczrth of Mzryt'cst.
