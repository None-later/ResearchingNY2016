Rangers- OutScoreiWinnipeg, 8-6

NEW YORK (AP) When Phil
Esposito retired from hockey some
six weeks ago and became and assis-
tant coach with the New York
Rangers, he gave his teammates
some advice.

“1 told them to shoot more,"
says Esposito. “It's one thing I'm
sorry I didn't do until the end of my
career."

Speciﬁcally, he was talking to
Eddie Johnstone, Don Maloney
and Nick Fotiu. And they appear to
be taking the veteran's advice, if
their most recent performances are
any indication.

Thursday night, the Rangers
unleashed a season-high 55 shots on
goal en route to an 8-6 National
Hockey League victory over the
Winnipeg Jets.

"1n Johnstone’s case, he’s got a
good shot." said Esposito. “I've
told him when he gets to the top of

Olympian

CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP) Stella
Walsh, the slain Olympic track star
whose death created a mystery
about her sex, lived with a rare
genetic defect only partially
understood today and not recogniz-
ed when she was born nearly '/0
years ago.

The abnormality. known as
mosaicism, is established before
birth, but its full implications often
are not realized until puberty or
later. Most of its victims are sterile
and are subject to lives of sexual
confusion.

Walsh, 69, a 1932 Olympic gold
medal winner in the 100-yard dash,
was shot to death Dec. 4 in what
police believe was an apparent rob-
bery attentpt near her home in
Cleveland.

the circle, he should be thinking of
shooting and not passing. It’s as
simple as 'that. if you don't shoot,
you’re not going to score."

Johnstone, the team's leading
scorer, has 50 points overall in 56
games, but 44 of those points have
come in the last 34 games, many of
them under Espo's tutelage.

Sometimes 1 forget to shoot,"
said thnstone, who had two goals
and two assists Thursday night,
“but Espo won’t let me. He keeps
reminding me of opportunities that
1 passed up when 1 come back on
the bench. After awhile, you get
conscious of it . Now 1 look at the
net a lot more. I take a quick look
and if 1 don't see anybody open, l
just heat up and let go."

The Rangers won their latest
game with the help of a goal by
Dean Talafous at 17:59 of the sc-
cond period that broke a 3-3 tie.

Along with Johnstonc‘s big
three times to give him seven goals
and an assist, stretching his streak
to 17 points 11 goals, 6 assists over
the last 11 outings. New York's
Carol Vadnais also had three
assists, boosting his NHL career
total to 402.

Dave Christian of the Jets scored
three times to give him seven goals
in the last four games.

Rick Dudley’s goal got the Jets
off to a 1-0 lead at 2:26 ofthe open-
ing period, but the Rangers
responded with three scores before
the session was finished.

Maloney evened matters at 3:50,
Barry Beck tallied on a power play
at 16:44 and 38 seconds later,
Johnstonc made it 3-1 with a shot
past Winnipeg goalie Markth Matt-
sson.

Tim Trimper got the Jets within
3-2 on a 10-foot shot at 18:08 and

’8 Defect A" Mystery

A report by the Cuyahoga Court-
ty coroner released Wednesday said
Walsh had one set of male
chromosomes and an ittcotnplete se-
cond set of chromosomes. That se-
cond set caused some cells to
develop as female cells.

The coroner also said she had
non-functioning male sex organs
and no female reproductive organs.

But Walsh, born Stanislawa
Walasicwicl, was brought up a girl
and lived her whole life as a female.
She was married briefly during the
1950s.

In mosaicism. instead of all cells
in a human embryo having .‘(Y sex
chromosomes, which would make it
male, or XX chromosomes, which
would make it female, the
chromosomes vary from cell to cell.

"Whatever type of mosaic ——

whether it‘s predominantly female
cells or male cells, whctltcr its (10-40,
whatever — happens in every pro—
portion you can think of." said Dr.
Angus Muir, a genetics specialist
form Case Western Reserve Univer—
sity.

At birth, the baby may appear to
be mostly male or mostly female,
bttt genetically. it may be the way it
appears or may be the Opposite. 0r
its sex may be ambiguous.

Today. il' a child is born with ex-
ternally abnormal sex organs, or if a
problem is suspected, a
chromosome analysis is performed
immediately. Sometimes sttrgcry is
needed to ttttlkc the child appear
and function as close to normal as
possible, according to the dominant
sex chromosomes.

 

’Alban‘ Student Press ‘ " February 13. 1981
y ‘ ‘ Christian tied the score with a

30-foot slapshot in the middle of
the second period before Talafous’
go-ahead score.

The Rangers improved their
lead to 6-3 on scores by Steve
Viekers and Dave Silk in the last
period. After Norm Dupont of the

Jets and J ohnstone exchanged goals
to make it 7-4, Christian. came
through twice in 16 seconds for
Winnipeg to close the gap to 7-6.

Dave Maloney ompieted the
game scoring for New York with an
empty-netter 37 seconds before the
final buzzer.

Chicago’s Payton Tops
List of NFL Paychecks

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) The
average salary in the National Foot-
ball League was $78,657 in 1980,
but star rttnning back Walter
Payton of the Chicago Bears made
six times that much, the San Fran-
cisco Chronicle reported Thursday.

Payton topped the salary list with
$475,000, the report said. But the
newspaper's survey did not take in-
to account incentive bonuses, which
would have raised Houston running

back Earl Campbell's pay to about ,

$500,000.

Bob Griese of Miami led the
quarterbacks and was the second-
hcst paid player at $400,025. He
has followed by Detroit running
back Billy Sims at $377,500, New
Orleans quarterback Archie Mann-

ing at $367.500 and Oakland
quarterback Dan Pastorini at
$358,333.

.litu Plunkett, who took over at
Oakland when Pastorini was in-
jttrcd and on went to become the
most valuable player of Super Bowl
XV. made $180,003 in 1980, 15th
among quarterbacks.

l’lunkctl‘s salary was a bargain
for the Raiders, bill it was cott-
\idcred a lot fora quarterback who
was cttt by tile San Francisco 49ers
itt 1977 and sat on Oakland‘s bench
in 1978 and 197‘).

The newspaper said the salary
lists were “based on public an-
nouncements of contracts and
discussions with knowledgeable
people in the NFL."

According to the survey. quarter-
backs lcd all positions, averaging
$131,206. as NH. salaries rose 14.2

percent last season. Running backs
averaged $83,469, receivers
$75,968, offensive linemen $74,596.
defensive linemen $85,469, receivers
$75,968, offensive linemen $74,596.
defensive linemen $85,683,
linebackers $70,753, defensive
backs $68,753 and kickers $60,861.

The top five quarterback salaries
belonged to Griese, Manning,
Pastorini, Pittsburgh's Terry Brad-
shaw with $329,500 and Baltimore's
Bert Jones with $300,001).

The. best-paid receiver was New
York .Icts rookie Johnny .lones with
$264,286. Denver had three of the
top five best-paid offensive

There is always a time for
revenge, and for the Albany
women’s basketball team, that time
came Monday night. They had suf-
fered a disappointing 11 point loss
to Union College two weeks ago

and had their sights set on revenge. ‘

They pulled it out, 57-55, in a game
marked by good defense and fast-
paced play, and an excellent com-
ebaek.

Starting off quickly, the Danes
scored first and led for the first four
minutes. However a Union basket
at 15:20 evened it up at six apiece.
Union then proceeded to open up
what had consistently become a ten-
point advantage, at 7:45, 21-11.
Union getting unanswered baskets

went into the locker room leading
21-32. Lynne Burton (four points)

and Nancy Halloran with five led _

the Dane scoring. .
Their-problem focused in the re-
bounding area. Offensively, there
was little to no rebounding in the
first half. The Danes looked
uninspired. Another problem was
the Union full court press, causing
numerous Albany turnovers.

The second half began the same
way, with the Danes making
baskets, but not holding the Union
women down. Albany slowly began
to play excellent defense behind
Luanne LaLonde. Finally, with
7:35 left, they had closed the gap to
within four on a jumper by Burtott,
who had art off night.

At 21:11, Union was hit with an
intentional foul on a breakaway.
Halloran stepped up to shoot three,

‘ with Albany down by two. She sunk

two of them to tie. Union never got
the lead back.

Neither team was able to save un-
til LaLonde put up an offensive re-
bound at 0:41 to give Albany the
55-53 edge. Burton scored with 0:17
left, off an inbounds play that went
wrong. That put the Danes ahead to
stay 57-53. Burton, having a cold
shooting night but, as always, con-
tributing in other ways, ﬁnished
with 12 points and 19 rebounds.
LaLonde ended with 10 points, 19
rebounds and five blocked shots.
Halloran, recuperating from her
illness excellently, led Albany

As the hockey regular season
winds down l'or the AMlA and
WlRA, each game is crucial as to
whether a team will or will not
make it to post-season competition.

In League I, there are no teams
that have clinched their division
titles, but there are many teams that
are all but guaranteed a playoff
spot. 1n the Orr division, The Silver
Bullets are 4-0 and are a shoe-in for
a playoff berth. The Stingers (3-1)

_and Ben Hair (2-2) are fighting for

the other playoff spot, as two teams
from each division make the
playoffs.

1n the Hull division, there are still
two teams that are underfeatcd, Los
Gringos (4-0) and The
Stiekhandiers (5-0). Recently, The
Stickltandlers came up with a big
7-2 win over the 3-1 Gottlieb-
Savlovs. An important upcoming
game pits Gottlieb-Savlov against
Los Gringos.

Looking at the Richard division,
The Werewolves, led by captain
Scott Segal. are in first place at 4-0.
The Weather (2-0-1) have a chance
to gain some ground on The
Werewolves in an upcoming con-
test. The Beaver Fury also havc post
season hopes as they are in third
place with a 2-1-1 record.

Rounding out League 1 is the
Lindsay division. The Cheap Shots
are unbeaten at 3-0. The Shrooms
are 3-1 and are a half game back,
and Sudden Death is playing .500
hockey with a 2-2 mark.

The womenjs gymnastics team trnve

    

are Forte of The Cheapshots with
eight goals, four assists; and Dampf
of The Stickhandlers and Weber of
The Silver Bullets tied with seven
goals and live assists.

1n League 11, first place in the
Howe division belongs to Riders On
The Storm (4-0) with The Duys a
game off the pace at 3-1. Easy B &
G (2-1-1) have a big game coming
up against the division leader.

In the Lemairc division. two
teams are undefeated at 4-0 —— Tile
Floor Lords and Point Blank. The
Lords just came up with a hard
fought 4-3 win over the stubborn
Executioners (2-2).

In the Sawchuck division, there
is a game tonight pitting ﬁrst place
Waste Product Hockey (3-0)
against the 2-0-1 second place Little
Rascals. The Rascals come off their
hard fottght 3-3 tie with The
Awesomes (l-l-l) who also have an
important game tonight against the
1-1-1 Egglanders.

The Big Sticks (3-0) are on top of
the Beliveau division. Three teams
are tied for second with 2-1 records
—— Sudden Death 2, The Sloners,
and The Welps. In a big upcoming
game that will most likely knock
one of the teams out of the playoff
picture. The Stoners take on Sud-
den Dcath 2.

In another extremely close race
the Oats (2-0-2) are atop the Gilbert

and The Red Army (2-1-1) close
behind. The Oats and The Red Ar-
my recently played a one-all tie.

Bosox Will Go All-Out For Fisk

BOSTON (AP) The Boston Red
Sox promised an all-out effort
Thursday to re-sign Carlton Fisk
after the veteran catcher won his
fight for free agency on a decision
by arbitrator Raymond Goetr.

"We will-make an effort, that‘s
the bottom line.“ Red Sox General
Manager Haywood Sullivan said.
"I think we‘ve still got a pretty
good chance to sign him . . . He
wants to stay here and we want him
here. Hopefully. we'll get together
very soon."

Sullivan said he was
“disappointed but not totally sur-
prised" by the ruling which made

Fisk a free agent rather than bin-
ding him to an option year this
season under his 1976 contract.

"I haven't seen the arbitrator's
opinion, which i'm told runs 21
pages, and 1 don't know the reasons
for it." Sullivan said. “I am not go-
ing to get into an argument with the
arbitrator. even though 1 may
disagree with him.

Fisk, 33, would have become a
10-year veteran with the Red Sox ill
the 1981 season. However, he
sought free agency after the Red
Sox mailed hhn a 1981 contract last
Dec. 22, two days after the
deadline.

Westﬁeld College Edges
Dane Gymnasts Narrowly

by Gail Goldsteln

On Wednesday afternoon, the
Albany State gymnasts traveled to
Westi‘ield College and was edged
out of a victory by a mere 2.65
points. The toal score was Westfield
100.4, Albany 97.75. Due to many
injuries, the Dane gymnasts did not
have enough competitors in the
floor exercise event and this was the
major contributing factor to their
1055.

Marty gymnasts did. however,
perform fine routines and many ob-
tained more of the requirer“ four
scores needed for Easterns.

1n the vaulting event, Albany‘s
Blaine Glynn performed well as

usual and scored an 8.15.

The bars event was one event
which the Danes dominated. First
place was awarded to Barb Shaw
with a 6.9 and second place was
taken by Glynn with a 6.65.

On the balance beam, Glynn
scored a 7.35 and Was followed by
Elicia Steinberg with a, 6.75.
Steinberg also achieved an‘ all
around score of 26.6 which
qualiﬁes her for the Easterns.

The gymnasts next meet will be
home tomorrow at 1:00 vs. Division
1 Hofstrn and Dlvison 11 University
of Connecticut. Admission is free,
andcompetltion begins at 1:00.

. .,,,..,.,_...,,. . ..

 

Don Fchr, counsel for the Major
League Players‘ Association, said it
was his understanding that Goetz
ruled Fisk a free agent because
Boston missed the deadline.

Neither Jerry Kapstein, Fisk’s
agent, nor Fisk, who reportedly
worked out Thursday at nearby
Tufts University before the ar-
bitrator's decision was announced.
was available for comment.

Sullivan said he has tried to setup
a meeting with Fisk and Kapstein
for several weeks, but “they wanted
it) wait until after the decision."

However, he added. “they pro-
mised to get back to me within 24
hours after the decision."

The Red Sox recently offered
Fisk a multi-year contract whi:h
would have paid him, including in-
centive clauses, nearly $500,000 a
year.

Questioned about the possibility
of signing Fisk. Sullivan said he
hoped for "a positive effort."

“You swallow your pride when
you get into a shooting match," he
said. “We don't expect him to get
on his knees and 1 don‘t think he
expects us to get on our l~ aces and
beg him to come back."

I know you
don ’t observe it,
but Happy
‘V-Day anyway.
