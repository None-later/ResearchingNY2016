Each has exhibited the
characteristics of a true champion

sistency and a certain intangible
quality which sets all champions
above the rest. Each is also rapidly
approaching one of their goals. the
goal of every collegiate wrestler. a
goal attained by only five Albany
wrestlers before them — All-
American status, and possibly a na-
tional championship. But. most im-
ortantly. each is a winner.

“They \are both outstanding
athletes with a feeling for ex-
cellence.‘ They have conﬁdence in
themselves and when they go out on
the mat they know they can win.
They like to get their hand raised."
said Albany head wrestling coach
Joe DcMco. the man most responsi-
blc for bringing them to Albany.

Scras particularly carries with
him a long winning tradition.
Besides a record shattering season
which saw him go l6-0—l in dual
mccts this year (36-5-1 overall). the
second bcsthcord in the history of
wrestling at Albany. the freshman
has a long list of credentials.

As ' a schoolboy wrestler at
Niskayuna High in Schenectady he

' had a 90-13 carccr record and was a
phenomenal 35-2 in his senior year.
He won the l979-80 National AAU
Elite Division Championship. was
l980 Outstanding Wrestler in that
tournament, seventh in the Senior

' Division National AAU Tourna-
ment. fourth in the World Cham-

pionships (despite an injury. and

still only losing to the defending
two-time champ). five-time New

York State champion and the list

goes on.

Both Scras and DcMco are confi-
dent that the former will become
Albany's first freshman All-
Amcrican, and there's no reason to
doubt them — he has lost to only
one Division lll wrestler this year
and that was in a match in which he
was wrestling far above his usual
weight.

Albany Student Press  Febpunry 13, 1931 V g
: Not All Winners Are Alike

“i think l’m deﬁnitely one of the
eight best. there’s no doubt in my
mind about that." Seras said soun-
ding a little bit cocky but in all
sincerity. “l'm pretty sure l'm go-
ing to be All-American. it's just
whether or not l'm going to be there
at the right time to be the champion
this year."

“He could be in the top three in
the country." DcMcc agreed. "He
expects to be there and i think i cx-
peci him to be there. too."

Unlike Scras. Herman did not
gain national recognition while at-
tending Linton High. also in
Schenectady. Although an excep-
tional leader and a standout

honors doesn’t go past Class A Sec-
tional champion in his senior year,
a year in which he went 30-2 (75-25
career). .

He has met with even greater suc-
cess at, Albany. Last year. as a
freshman. Herman wcnt l5-3 in
duals (30-9 overall) and qualified
for the Nationals. barely missing
All-American status with a ninth
place ﬁnish (the top eight are All-
American).

This season. as the team captain.
he slipped to l5-5 in duals (35-ll
overall). but many of those losses
were early in the year when he was
still recovering froma bout with
mononucleosis. He has been hot of
late.

“l think l’m starting to peak now
this season — ﬁnally." said Her-
man. "Now l‘m completely healthy

and l think 1'“ do well. i think l'm
starting to reach my peak just at the
right time."

And just at the right time it is.
The SUNYAC tournament begins
today and is the stepping stone to
Nationals. The top four wrestlers in
each weight class plus one wild card
will represent the SUNYAC at John
Carroll University in two weeks.

“The SUNYAC is the toughest
conference in the nation in wrestl-
ing Division lll. We are to Division
lll as the Big Ten is to Division I.
it's so much tougher.“ commented
DcMco.

“SUNYACs. l think i can win.
but it's not one of my goals." Her-
man pointed out. “I want to win

   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  

Seras

.,.

the Division lll National Cham-
pionship."

Ultimately. both wrestlers have
higher aspirations. and with the cf-
fort and determination that they
put into wrestling there doesn't ap-
pear to be anything in their way.

“My goal for Andrew is for him
to be good enough to beat anybody
in the country. i don't like to set
any limits." DcMco remarked.

“Potentially i could be a world
champion," Scras said. and added.
“l know enough technique right
now to be a world champion. i just
need to polish it and do maybe

‘ twenty of the techniques I kttow so 1
r can do them perfectly every time ——

and‘tltat takes time and practice."

Scras is good and he knows it.
but he exudes confidence rather
than braggadocic. He is hungry for

 

victory and attention —- to' know
he's the best. He reminds you a lit-
tle of Joe Namath. in his own 134
pound way.

“An athlete is a showman. real-
ly." he said. “i don't gloat about it.
but it’s a nice feeling."

Herman also looks to the future
for bigger and better things. but he
is more modest and cautious than
Seras. Yet there is a quiet con-
ﬁdence that you feel when you talk
to him.

“Long term. i want to be the best
guy in the country. overall. over all
divisions." he offered. and said
that he would also like to compete
in the l9880lympics before settling
down into a career.

“Right now. realistically. l’m
very far down the line (from a
World Championship). l'm hoping
that 1 can progress and get a shot to
be that good.

“i think l'm going along the right
path." he continued. “l'm wrestl-
ing every day of the year. and if I
keep working all year round. l'll be
good cnouglt to be up there."

An important difference between
Herman and Scras is their attitude
toward the team. They both enjoy
‘ wrestling for Albany. bttt for Scras
it is just a means toward an ultimate
end while for Herman it can be an
end in itself.

“When it comes right down to it
your out there for yourself." said
Scras. “l‘m conscious of the team,
but it's not even me and the team ——
it‘s a pretty good separation."

“I think tltc main reason i wrcstlc
or the main reason i enjoy it is be-
ing on a team and having that

means a lot to me."
remarked in contrast.

And his leadership and motiva-
tional ability as captain of the team
has not gone uttnoticcd by his team-
mates or DcMco. He‘s very well
respected by his fellow athletes."
DcMeo noted. "He's been a good
leader and a help to the coach. He's
one of the most outstanding
athlcics I've had the pleasure of
working with."

Each one ltas made it through a

special comradcric that you have

ﬁ'
different route. but they have both

made it. and there is one thing that
keeps tltcm going.

“Winning is my life right now. .
All my training and everything in
for that ultimate win." Seras
reﬂected.

"i spent u lot of time losing and i
paid my dues early." Herman
observed. “The more i lost the
more determined I was to win. and i
wasn't going to stop wrestling until
1 could win all the time -— l'm very
competitive as far as that’s concern-
ed. l like to win."
