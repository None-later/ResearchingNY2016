Beat Bingh‘amton, 52-46

by Bob Bellafiore

TROY — Utilizing a more open. free-lance offense and an ag-
gressive. pressing defense. the Albany State basketball team
went on a 12-6 spree in the first 6:17 of the second half to open
up a 30-18 lead. and defeated RPl, 55-44 Thursday night.
The Danes pressed the slower Engineers for most of the
game. but it wasn‘t until Albany switched its defensive strategy
from a zone to a full court man-to-man coverage that things

began to happen.

“in the second ltalf. we changed it up a little bit and played a
little free-lance.” said Albany foward Pete Stanish. “We,
started running and getting some lay-ups."

0f Albany’s 18 second half field goals, eight were on lay-
ups. and Stanish had four of those in netting 12 points in that
half. He tied center John Dicckclman for Dane scoring honors
with 14, who had 10 tallies of his own in the final period.

The game started slowly. with Albany jumping out to a 40
lead on jump shots by co-captains Ray Cesare and Rob Clune.
A pair ofTom Martinelli (game high 19 points) free throws and

a Brian Apt shot from the side. tied it up at 4-4. Bttt after the
Danes took an 8-6 advantage on Dicckelman's spinning lay-in
with 11:37 left in the optrting half. the Engineers had to play

catch-up for good.

Albany pulled themselves out of
their shooting slump slightly. hit-
ting 24 of their 46 field goal at-
tempts. bttt the real story of tltis
game was the defense. which was
geared to stopping RPl's 6-8 center
Pat Roohan. ‘lt did. and even
though he had two blocked shots.
he was never a factor in the game.

“i think we've made progress."
said Albany head basketball Dick
Sauers of his 163 Danes. presently
ranked thirteenth in the nation.
"We were aggressive — a little
more alert. 1 think we've turned it
around."

Tuesday night, the Danes had to
bear with another bout with errant
shooting to just get by Binghamton.
52-46. in a conference game at

University Gym. Albany shot a not
so impressive 19 for 51 from the
floor. mostly because the Colonial
1-2-2 zone defense forced the Danes
to bomb away frorn outside.

“1 think they had an awfttl lot of
trouble with our defense." said
Binghamton head basketball coach
John Afflcck.

Albany suffered three scoring
droughts in the game — one that
lasted 7:41 in the middle of the se-
cond half that allowed the Col-
onials to overcome a 36-30 deficit.
and take a 38-36 lead. The Duties
also went the last 4:14 of the first
half with only entitling two points (it
Mike Gatto follow-up of trn nir
ball). and survived tt stretch 01' 6:09
near the end of the contest with a

  
 

mere five points.

Binghamton was not much bet-
ter. shooting at a 17 for 49 clip.
With the Albany defense shutting
down Charles Heins to a meager
three points (11 under his team
leading average) on one for nine
shooting. the Colonial attack never
got untracked. “Tonight for some
reason," Afflcck said of Heins. tltc
former roommate of Albany‘s
Stanish. “he was maybe trying too
hard. He got a little flustcred early.

“We had countless oppor-
tunities. but we just didn’t pttt the
ball in the basket."

But the Colonials nearly pulled
this one out. coming httck from It)
points down in tire first half. and
were only down by one with 1:311 re-
maining in the game. 45-44. when
the Danes ptrllcd away with five
straight points on two Clttrre (game
high 20 points) free throws. a fast
break basket by Stanish. and
another free throw by sub Steve
Low.

Coming off the bench. Low pro-
vided the fuel to tire sputtering
Danes. who were playing Bingltam-
ton for the second time this . ttson
after a loss to Potsdam. In just
under 28 minutes on the court (12
over his average). the 6-4 senior
contributed 13 poirtts (five of five
from the floor). 12 rebounds
(including the 200th of his Albany
career). and tottglt. hustling
defense.

“1 was really irtrpresscd with
Steve's play." Sauers said. “He was
tittc. I figured he's strong. he's
ready —— 1 knew he was going to
have a good game." ‘

it was Low's rebounds of Clune
air balls that sandwiched Albany’s
seven-minute scoreless period in the
second half. and his defense along
with that of Dieckelntan. on Heins
that held the rival‘forward in check.

The win moved Albany‘s record

 

February 13 1981

to 15-3 (5-2 in the SUNYAC). and
while it got the Danes back on the
winning track. Snuers was unhappy
about his team's performance.

“It took a few big plays at the
end." he said. “The only reason we
won was we know ltow to win.

“i knew we‘d be flat today."

 

Two Victories Put Albany Back On Track

Sauers continued. “Not that we
didn't respect Binghamton (now
9-11). 1 just knew we'd be flat. I
guess the time'to play tts is after we
play Potsdam. Maybe this will get
the cobwebs out of their brains."

cording to UAS President Dave

Fredonia Paper Questioned

'0‘ Susan Mllligttrt

Perceived “obiectiontrble”
language in an October 1980 issue
of SUC/Fredortia's The Leader has
spurred a lteatctl debate between
that publication's editorial board
and neighboring Dunkirk's
Citizen‘s Action Board (CAB) that
is yet unresolved.

The CAB‘s itritinl concern was in
regard to The Leader's explicit ac»
count of comments said to a female
college employee in the reporting of
it sexual harassment case. The
organization later ttrrned its atten-
tions to other sections of the paper
they dcertted inaprn‘opriate. anti
subsequently acted in art attempt to
censor those aspects. according to
Lem/er editor irr chief Randy .l.
Woodbttry.

"The Lem/er contains articles on
the degradation of women. piettrres
which show the cross (crucifix) in a
hard light, and profane words."
CAB Research Director Joseph
Carrus said. “We feel these things
have no place in a stttdcrtt
newspaper. "

The Dunkirk group is particular-
ly angry at the publication of a
Picasso print depicting a couple
engaged in a sex act and several col-
umns written by Leader managing
editor Martin LeFever that they feel
are degrading and sexually explicit,
he said.

Woodbttry commented in an
editorial that “several sections of

The Lem/er were particularly trvnnt~
Ettrdc . . . and in reaction. it little
.lolrrr Birch Society has decided that
non-cosrnopolitan i’rcdonia needs
to be spared the challenge of diulec»
tics and the strain of intellectual in-
quisltion."

Woodbttry charged that the CAB
"has dtrmpcd hundreds ofcopies of
The Leader in the trash. written
anonymous letters to Lear/er adver-
tisers pleading for them to
withdraw ccortornie support. artd
pleaticd to The Leader advisor
(George Scboultian) to persuade the
paper to quiet down."

Carrtts explained that as part of
their campaign. the CAB sertl ottt
35 packets of Lear/er issues to
various people and organizations.
inclttding SUNY Cltancclior Clifton
R. Wharton, the SUNY Board of
Trustees. and several New York
State Legislators.

He added that as a result. the
CAB “received letters expressing
dismay. . .and those who wrote at-
trihtrted the content of The Lem/er
to ‘an immattrrc desire to push
freedom of expression to the
|imit."'

LeFever contends that botlt he

and Wootlbury have been harassed
by o_nc or more members of the
CAB. “'l'hcy wrote a letter to Ratt-
dy (Woodbut'y)'s father 1with
enclosed copies of tire paper asking
'15 this your son?‘ " LeFever said.
“They also went to tr family by the
name of LeFever who title in
neighboring Westl'rcld and asked if
they were related to me (-after
showing them the columns)."
(‘at'rus said the (‘AB “has never

harassed anybody.

New Paltz Solar Homes Are Closed

by Wayne l’eereboom

The future of six experimental
solar ltorrtes at SUNY College at
New Paltz is in dottbt because of
alleged violtrtions of New York
State health and safety codes. rte-
cording to that college‘s SA Budget
Controller Peter Healy.

Last September. newly appointed
college President Alice Chandler
“served what was in effect an evic-
tion notice" to students living in the
homes. Hcaly said.

The houses have

"no indoor

plumbing. no water. no clectriciiy.‘
Most of the buildings are thrown
together." lre added.

New Paltz Oracle editor 'I'om
Topousis said the homes would pro-
bany be torn down.

However. Healy said. “the Presi-
dent prorniscd $10,000 to ptrt in a
water-well and electricity."

Beginning in 1972. the SA-owned
homes were built as part of
classwork in the innovative Sttldies
department. according to Topousis.
“it was like a separate culture

there." Topousis said.

l‘lettly notctl that “people living
tlterc used nearby dorms for
water.“ Also. the only electricity
was supplied by a long extension
cortl. None of the boarders paid
rent and there was no supervision at
all. Ire added.

The conflict began when the new
president was inforrtted by the state
of the potential for probletrts in-
volving college liability for injury at
the site. Healy explained. He added

UCB and WCDB Will Work Together

 

 

 

phi-tn: nub Leon-rd

UBC’s Dave Montanuro and WCDB's Jim Diamond.
They will be working together again on campus events.

by Debbie Judge

After approximately tltrce mon-
tlts of disagreement. the campus
radio station. (WCDB) and the
University Concert Board (UCB)
anttourrced that they will once agaitr
be working together on campus
events.

The decision was reached at a
meeting last Thursday night bet~
weert WCDB General Manager. Jim
Diamond anti UCB Chair Dave
Montanaro.

According to Diamond. “UCB’s
going to take their shows one at a
time. they will analyze what their
best strategic approach is for max-
imttm ticket sales regarding the co-
sponso‘rship of tl;..ir shows with
radio stations. As it looks now. we

will be working with them on the
good majority of the events. "
Montanaro said that in some
cases it is not economically feasible
to co-sponsor events with WCDB.
because it broadcasts with only 10
watts and is only effective in
reaching the uptown campus. Most
commercial stations have thousands
of watts. and a more extensive au~
dience. '
According to Montanaro.
economic reasons led UCB to seek
chssnlaer radio station WQBK as
n co-sponsor for their Roekplle con-
cert last fall rather than WCDB. as
was originally planned. This action
led to the dispute between the two
groups. in November, soon after
UCB’s decision was announced.

Diamond had reported that WCDB
members were “surprised and
trpsct."

“it was pretty hot there." lte said
recently. describing a meeting ofthe
two groups that took place soon
after the dispute erupted. “The
whole relationship (between UCB
and WCDB) was up in the air."

“In my mind it‘s always been a
temporary thing." Montanaro ex-
plained. “We never stopped talk-
ing." Several meetings between the
two groups since last November had
eased the tension before the present
agreement was reached.

Diamond. too. was glad to see
the dispute settled. “l'm glad in one
sense. to see that two organizations
