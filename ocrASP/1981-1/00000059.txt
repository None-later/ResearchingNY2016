“was I sexy?”

Singer Rod Stewart could not
resist the impulse to read about
himself in tire new book written by
his err-girlfriend Britt Ekland; but,
as Stewart put it, “i was datttncd if
I was going to pay“ for the
privilege.

Stewart told People magazine
that lie simply sltoplifted a copy of
the book at London‘s Heathrow
Airport. Says Rod: "i looked
around for sccttrity measures, and i
just grabbed it. I put it straight
under rrty fur coat."

human immortality

’l‘hv Futurist Magazine rcports
tltat a growitrg number of biological
researchers is suggesting that
human inrrnortality could he ltcrc
within the next two to tltrcc
decades.

As biologist Alvin Silvcrstcin

recently put it: “Wc rtray bc tltc last '

generation to dic."

Silverstciu argucs tltat modern
science is doubling its knowledgc of
things about many l'ivc ycars. llc

says that tnedical science currently
understands about 10 percent of
the principles of the human body,
artd that — by the tnid-l990's —— 80
pcrccnl or more: will be known.

 

Silvcrstcin says that as otrr
understanding of DNA repair and
tire operation of otrr irtrtuuttc
systems incrcascs, we should be able
to stop the aging process ctrtircly.

Silvcrstcin envisions a world itt
which “cnrot‘tals” (spelled with art
"13") will halt long rangc pollution
and otltcr lortg rangc problems
because they will rcali/c that pro-
blems lrutrdrcds of ycat's irt tltc

Writing in The Journal 'of Per-

White says that the most successful
rclationsltips almost always occur-
red when botlr partners received the
same ratings -— that is, when both

rated below average. Wltcrr ottc

titan the other, White says, those
relationships were found much
more likcly to break up.

it's an invasion of privacy that
could be construed as harassment
on the part of the camerawoman."

Monahan told The Leader after
the incident he “regrets what has
happened" but felt he “had no
need to apologize."

Monnhan said he did not want to
be filmed because the CAB "is
suspicious . . . many, many are
suspicious of the operations concer-
nittg the college and the city's situa-
tion."

Regarding the incident,
SUC/Fredonia President Dallas
Bcal said “the threat was a serious
one" and the college “would be in-
clincd to prosecute."

Bcal said of tire content of The
Leader that "the language was not
legally obscene;" he added, l
ltowcvct, that the college “cart ex-
pect atul dcfcrrd studcnts who get
into obiccrionablc areas."

Also, l’ologc pointed out, Barnes

Collins emphasized, however,

that before SUNY Follct opcru-zl itr
SUNYA over eight years ago, “we
were in a dreadful mess." Before
then, SUNYA run its own
bookstore. "They moved into art
ulrtrost impossible situation and
‘slt'uightcnctl it out." The Barucs

“just secured more attractive than
any other offer."
