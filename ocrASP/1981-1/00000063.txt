Top vet Capetition Too Much For

by Gull Goldsteln

The Great Dane gymnasts com-
peted on Saturday against Division
lHoTstra and Division 11 University
of Connecticut, and lost to both
teams. Hofstra won with 120.85
points, Connecticut was sccond
(111.65). and Albany was third
(79.25). As Albany gymnastics
coach Pat Duval-Spillanc an-
ticipated,”A high level of gym-
nastics was exhibited due to the fact
that Division 1 and 11 schools can
recruit and offer scholarships.
Albany, being a Division 111 school
can do neither.“

The Danes started the season
with a small team and this number
has continually grown smaller due

to an excessive amount of injuries.
Top gymnast Elaine Glynn, who
was forced to withdraw from the
competition due to a sprained back
commented, “The team is working
.hard, but the number of injured
members is deﬁnitely a hindering
factor in our ability to win meets."

Duval-Spillanc added, “Due to
the injuries, many members arc
starting to compclc in events in
which they normally don’t perform.
However, even though they are
competing in more events than nor-
mally. we still don't have the rc-
quired number of competitors in
each event."

Thc gymnasts that did compete in
Saturday's mcct performed fine
routines. Ann Salsmcycr received a

7.4 on her handspring vault and
Barb Shaw got a 6.7 on her uneven
bars routine.

On the balance beam, Albany
fared well. Elicia Steinbcrg received
a 6.3, Salsmcycr reached 5.25 and
chbit: Schochcr who performed
her routine with a broken hand did
a fine job. attaining a score of 5.0.

in the all-around competition,
Steinbcrg scored a 27.25. This is her
third of four rcquircd scores needed
to qualify for the Eastern Chum-
pionships.

Steinberg and the other gymnasts
will be able to try again for more
qualifying scores on Saturday at
homc witcn they will meet New
Li’altz and Keene State at 1:00 pm.

The Albany Sttttc women‘s
basketball team fnccd tough com-
petition this weekend and came out
of it in a disappointing fashion
plagued by sickttcsscs, pcop‘i' play-
ing out of their normal posrtions,
and just a basic slump. The women
lost to Hartwick 84—55 and to
Humiltott {50-37.

The game at Hartwick was an ex-
citing one for almost the cntirc first
half. Both teams played cxccllcnt
defense and traded baskets. But
with nine minutes still to go in tire
first half, the Danes slowed down
and stoppcd moving on offense.
“Once we Stopped moving on of-
fcnsc, Httriwick began to score
morc and tltey broke tltc game
open,” Albuny women‘s basketball
coach Amy Kidder rctlcctcd.

Down 45-32 at tltc end of the
half, the Danes begun a comeback,
and reeled of eight points to Hurt—
wick's two. However, they could
not kccp tltc momentum going and
had it total lack of continuity.

“We would get close, then we
would stop and take a break. Two
of their players were real hot in the
first half, but in the second ltnlfwc
held tltcttt dcfcnsivcly for about six
minutes. Still. we could not
capitalize on it," Kidder said.

women’s indoor truck tcttm. Faring
well against mostly Division 1 corn—

meets, the squad took a fourth
place in the Dartmouth meet on
Saturday, a third place in the Con-
nccticut meet last week and a fourth
place in the Vermont tncct, also last
wcck.

The track team currently has it
record of 3-9 but thut does not real-
ly rcflcct tltc quality of the tcum’s

losses have bcctt to scholarship
schools, that have provided very
tough opposition for thc Divison lll
Duties. Still, Albany entries have
consistently mnnngcd thirds and

bad shooting nights, and tire results
wcrc disastrous.

The game remained closc again
for tltc ctttirc ﬁrst half. "We played
really well the first half" both Kid-
der and assistant coach Chris
llchrcns commented.

The second half began the same
way until Albany stopped making
baskets. They were able to managc
only cigttt baskets for the whole sc-
cond ltnlf. Luunttc Lalondc proved
to be u brigltt spot for Albany scor-
ing nine points and playing ag-
