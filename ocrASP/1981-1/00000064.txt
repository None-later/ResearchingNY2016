Beat

by Marc Haspel

Up again. in a season full of ups
and downs, Albany State junior
varsity basketball team beat the
Plattsburgh Cardinals, 63-55 Satur-
day night at University Gym. Two
nights before that. the jayvees
avenged an earlier season loss to the
RH Engineers by beating them eon-
vincingly. 76-57.

The J.V. Danes had little pro—
blem handling the Cardinals. To
begin with. Plattsburgh only had
seven players on the jayvee squad.
Several players had been brought
up to the varsity and others were ill,
according to Cardinal .I.V. head
basketball coach Dan Theiss.

Yet after Dane forward Dean‘

Graebeil (20 points. game high)
opened the scoring with a three-
point play, the Cards went on a 1041
scoring streak. But a Billy Everett
(15 points) double pump lay-up
5:45 into the game gave Albany the
lead. 12-10, which they never relin-
quished.

Even though the Cards fell
behind early in the score. Thelss
kept using a zone defense allowing
Albany to stall for the ﬁnal 2:30 of
the first half (leading 2649).

“They were bigger than us. Our
biggest guy was six inches smaller
than theirs. it would have been to
their advantage to play man-to-
man. i went to a zone to get possi-
ble two-on-ones and to stay out of

Pgh’

But the Danes had different
ideas. Albany .i.V. head basketball
coach Rick Skeel wanted to open up
a running game on the Cards. “We
wanted to run on these guys. Once
they went into a zone, it hurt since
we had little outside shooting,"
Skeet said.

The Danes. however. took ad-'
vantage of the Cardinals' weak
zone and were able to work the ball
inside. “They were trying to be con-
servative on defense and we were
still working the bail inside." said
Albany forward George Archible.
who has also played very tough
defense in recent games.

Four times. the Danes opened up
12-point leads. Twice on Bill Reil-
ly's short jump shots. once on Dan
O'Donnell’s.banker and the final
time coming on Everett's short pop.

But. over'a 5:28 span late in the
second half. Plattsburgh outscored
Albany 14-8. with Jim Gant ac-
counting for six of those. “Gant
was hotter than a firecracker
tonight. But we did a nice job on
him." said Skeet.

Plattsburgh got within six points
over t at late
half surge. but Graebell killed any
Cardinal hopes of catching up by
stealing the ball in Albany's end
and going up for a thunderous slam
dunk with just 19 seconds remain-
ing. That bucket ended the scoring
at 63-55.

“We got outside shots and re-

RPI In Week

bounds,” said Everett. “it was a
pretty good game for us."

Thursday night, the Danes had a
good game against RPI also. Earlier
this season, Albany had lost to the
considerably taller team by eleven
points, 62-51. but Thursday. things
were quite different.

The problem facing Albany in the
first meeting was the dotnination by
the big men, especially 6-8 Engineer
forward Bill Bowers. This time.
Albany overcame that problem by
running all over the Engineers and
managing to out-rebound them.

Everett scored 26 points and Ar-
chible was nearly invincible under
the boards with twelve points most-
ly coming from offensive rebounds.

“We ran on them and we made
them put their smaller faster guys
in. That's how you have to beat
them,” said Skcel.

Albany took a comfortable 40-17
lead into halftime which allowed
Skeet to do “a little overcoaching. i
started experimenting a bit. We
tried a couple of offdnses." said the
Danes coach.

The jayvees controlled the tempo
of the entire game. (quite contrary
to the previous contest between
these two teams) stalling and runn-

ing at will. The ﬁnal score was
7 6 - 5 7 .

“We came out of our shell
against RPi. We were playing a
good game. believing in the pass."
said guard Carl Askew. “We’re
playing more like a team now."

event. as well as the one-meter Op-

in the latter. the eleventh event in
this Iii-event competition. that put
the Danes on top for good.

White felt that it wasn't
necessarily the winners that were
the key to Albany's victory. but the
swimmers who placed in the four.
other scoring slots that gave his
team the advantage.

“We had the depth." White said.

Anyone who got into the top five
(spots) did ti good job.

"We didn't will a relay and we
won the meet — that’s the type of
meet it was."

Trackmen Partake In Valentine’s Day

by Jim Markotsis

The Albany State mens track and
field team gave three opponents
their version of Valentine‘s Day (is
they massacred R.P.l.. Union and
Siena Saturday. When the smoke
had cleared it was Albany on top
with 62.5 points. R.P.l. second
(46.5). Union third (40), followed
by Siena (25). This meet. held at
Union leaves Albany with on im—
pressive 9-3 record for the season.

Once again Albany men's track
and field coach Bob Munsey had
nothing but positive thoughts about
the meet—once it was over. But
before the meet be was busy reshuf-
fling people into events due to
assorted injuries and illnesses.
Among the incapacitated were Jim
Roth. hurdier Mitch Harvard and
Bruce Briggs. His efforts proved to
be quite effective. and paid off in
the very first event—the long jump.

Without Briggs jumping. junior
Tim Gunther knew he needed to

Cygnets

 by Robin Brown

A minor seven point spread was
the difference between Villanovo's
first and Albany Slate‘s second
place finish in the synchronized
SWimming Routine invitational held
at llniversity Pool Saturday.

Scoring behind Albany's 53
points in third was Gencsco with 43
points and Vassar in fourth with six
points. Vassar had only one com-
petitor.

“Albany by far had the most
highly skilled routines except for
two women from Villa Nova." said
Albany synchronized swimming
coach Pat Rogers.

Albany captured both first and
second place in the novice duels
routine. in first was the duo of
Nancy Carroll and Mary Ann
Strcb. both freshmen. with team-
mates Patti Lowe and Amy
Hcveron. sophomorcs. receiving sc-
could place honors. “This was the

score well to gel the team off on the
right foot. He did. coming through
with it personal best. and ii
qualified him for the stale mcci.

“I've been thinking about this
meet all week." Gunther said. “and
i just relaxed and put it all
together.“ In the same event.
freshman Greg Ulrich (jumping in
his first meet) tied for fourth place.

The second event was the
hurdles. which has bcett the
strongest event of the year for the
Danes. Yet without Harvard.
Albany was going inlo the event
without their best. But as Munscy
has been saying lately. “the clutch
kids come through." and the
hurdles finished 1.2.3. Slcvc Decker
was the winner. followed by Brian
Rogulc and Dan Kennedy. Thus.
the tone of the Incet was set after
the first two events where the Danes
jumped out to it quick lead even
without two key performers.

Scott James look it litird in the

i5()()-mctcrs which was the third
event of the afternoon.

The fourth event was a real big
one for the Danes. with Kcuncdy
shattering the school record in the
pole vault. The previous record
(which Kennedy has tied) was 13
feet. in winning the event on Satur-
day he vaulted one foot bcticr.
Ragulc finished second with on im—
pressive 13 foot vault. At this point
there was no stopping the Danes.

in the next two events Albany nd-
dcd two third place finishes and two
fourth to - their rapidly growing
score. Ed MiiIcr high jumped six
feet with a badly swollen foot. and
Bob Terpstra was riglu behind him
in fourth place. The triple jump saw
Gunther coming through with
another personal record of 12:79
meters as he took third. and Bill
('oudon (l2.72 meters) look fourth.

In the 45-inctcr dash. Howie
Williams broke his own school
record its he won the event in 5.4

seconds. Al Ferguson matched the
old school record of 5.5 seconds its
Iic crosscd the finish line in second
place.

Ferguson come right buck in the
next event to take another second.

had nothing hul praise for
Ferguson. “He ran the dash twice.

third in the event and Scott Sachs
came in fourth.
