Sometimes it’s just too easy to _

write off a struggling team.

The Albany State wrestling squad
ﬂoundered through a disappointing
7-13 season, and for all intents and

purposes looked like an also ran. '

But this weekend five Albany
wrestlers dramatically turned their
season around. surprising
everybody by qualifying to compete
in the Division lll National Cham-
pionshlps.

Andrew Sems. Spiro Theofilatos.
Bill Endres. Vic Herman and Mark
Goosscns all placed in the top four
of their respective weight classes in
the very difficult SUNVAC tourna-
ment to send tiiem on an all ex-
penses paid trip to John Carroll
University in two weeks.

"it was a great showing.” said an
obviously pleased and excited
Albany head wrestling coach .loc
DeMeo about the Danes' impressive
fifth place finish. “Everybody

wrestled great—tliey got good just
at the right time to get good."

The big story. as it has been all
year. was Seras. Wrestling at l34
pounds. he brought home Albany's
first SUNYAC championship in
eight years and upped his overall
record to an amazing 39-5-1.

“Seras has proven throughout
the year that not only can he win the
big ones. but that he can beat the
guys who can win the big ones."

 

February 17. 1981

DeMeo proudly noted.

Seras pinned John Egitto of
Binghamton in the ﬁrst round, and
then edged his former high school
co-captain, Tim Abigail from
Brockport. 8-6. He then went on to
the finals and outpointed
Potsdam's Mark Norris. 11-8, in
what many people felt was the most
exciting match of the tournament.

“I was confident. but i really had
to come up with something extra at
the end." Scras said about his
match against Norris. and added,
“it was extra sweet making it to the
finals. and also beating Tim."

Theofilatos qualified at 142
pounds. winning two ottt of his
three matches. In the first round he
wrestled .loe Sciarma to a l0-lt) tie
in regulation and after an overtime
period they were still even. btrt
Theofilatos was awarded the match
on criteria. He then went on to phi
Leo Cosgrovc and was leading in
his final match, 6-3. with only 0:39
remaining when iic lost on a fall.

“He was wrestling just super."
commented DeMco.

Early in the season Endres was
out with a knee injury. biit he seems
to have recovered nicely. The 150
pounder beat the number fotrr seed,
9-3. lost to the eventual champion.
.loe Giani. anti then came up with a
clirtch victory over Tim Hogan. 6-3.
for fourth place.

"That took the pressure off."

said Endres, who then defaulted the
next match due to illness.

Herman. the team captain. was
seeded firstin the l77 pound class.
but had to settle for fourth after
suffering an injury in the
semifinals. He nipped Paul
Newman in the opener. 3-2. was in-
jured in the semis, but came back to
overwhelm Potsdam's Rich Sclilan—
sky. 16-0.

“I wasn't wrestling that well,"
Herman noted. “If i lost that
match l wouldn't go to Nationals.
so l just let everything go.“

Goosscns. a freshman
heavyweight, wrestled brilliantly to
earn himself a spot in the Nationals.
He bested .lohn O'Siillivan iii his
first match. 9-0. was tripped tip by
Brockport‘ Chris Haley. 14-3. in
the second round. but put a lock on
fourth place by crushing .lefl'
Palmer. B-O. He lost his final match
to Bob Kassitas. whom he had lost
to twice before this year.

Seth Zamck also wrestled well for
Albany. finishing fifth in the lift
pound division. and is the first
alternate to Nationals.

Only 300 wrestlers in the nation
make it to the Division lll cham-

' pionships and the five Albany will

be sending is the most they have
ever qualified. Of the 30 com-
petitors in each weight cltiss. the top
eight will gain All-American status.
a feat only accomplished five times
before by Albany wrestlers.

Cesare’s Shot With :02 Left Downs Union, 66-64

SCHENECTADY — Ray Ccsare’s short jump sltot with just
two seconds remaining broke a 62-62 deadlock. and gave the
Albany State basketball team a 64-62 win over a late-surging
Union College team. Monday night at Union's Memorial Field

House.

The Danes led by it points. 57-46. with 8:37 to go in the
game. but Union went on a 13-3 tear in the next five minutes to
close the gap. Guard Joe Clinton's (20 points) three-point play
with 24 seconds left knotted the contest at 62. when Albany
'alled time out, and set up their final play.

It was designed that Albany would wait until there were to
.econds left on the clock. and then look for either Pete Stanish.
Rob Clune. or Cesare to shoot.

“We wanted to run a stall for ID seconds, and then establish
a point man." Cesare said. “But it didn't work out."

“That person that had the ball with 10 seconds was supposed
to go down (near the basket) and either dish off or look to

shoot." Stanish said.

Stanish was that person. With five ticks left on the clock. he
let go with a»jumper from the corner that missed.

"l knew how much time was left, but they were playing the
other men so hard. 1 had no choice but to shoot it," the for-

ward continued.

and swished his shot over two outstretched defenders. clinching

the victory.

But judging by the way the first
30 minutes of this Capital District
clash went. it didn't seem as if it
would come to a last second basket.
Albany led for the entire game
(except for a 40 second span early in
the first hall) and maintained con-
trol as well as a to point lead

 

Behind their till-time leading ’ g;

their money.

“it was a great comeback they
almost made." Sauers said. "I

ing trouble getting it in. I knew we
would."

Still. the Danes had three men in

Vol. vam No. 7

Sexual Harassment Policy Issued V

by Beth Sexer

SUNYA President Vincent
O'Leary issued a letter to the
university in January stating that
the issue of sexual harassment as a
violation of policy “applies equally
to all aspects of campus life. in-
cluding the classroom and extra-
curricular activities."

O’Leary‘s letter followed the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Corrimission‘s (EEOC) publication
of its final guidelines with respect to
sexual harassrricnt in the work
place.

The fifi()(‘ guidelines state tlitrt
sexual harassment is it violation of
Section 703 of Title VII of tire Civil
Rights Act of l‘)(i4. They apply to
federal. state arid loctil govern~
rnctrts, as well as private employers
with I5 or more ctiiployccs.

'l'hc EEOC has defined htrrtiss~
tricnt on the basis of sex as
“iiiiwelcomed sexual advances. re-
quests for sexual favors, and other

 

verbal or physical conditcts of a sex-
ual nature“ when:

—~ submission to such condtict is
made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition ofaii individual's
employment

— submission to or rejection of
such condtict by an individual is us-
ed as the basis for employment deci-
sions affecting such individual

— such conduct has the purpose or
effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's work perfor-
marrcc or creating an intimidating.
hostile. or offensive working cri»
viroririrciit.

O‘Leary said thin while the
release of thc lit-it )(' guidelines gtivc
liiiti the impetus to release his policy
statement. the government
guidelines are “quite independent“
from his own.

The lzleC guidelines tipply only
to employtrient. while the ritiivcrsity
policy extends even “to students in
dormitories. tiriti classes.“ ()‘l.ctu'y

said.

"We are concerned withmore
than simply meeting the letter of the
law or observing the technical rc-
quircments of employment regula-
tions." O‘Leary wrote. "At issue
here is fundamental respect for the
dignity of every person in the
University."
