to avoid future problems, students

ofthc items being bought is also im-

“Ask the seller if there is a dis-

negotiable." Hester continued.
“And also find out whether or not
delivery is included in the price."

Landlords of bollt furnished anti

tenants to leave a security deposit,
usually arnorrrrtirrg to one month‘s

“If there are six or more apart-

"The tenants have the right to

Vandalism at SUNYA: Its Causes and Solutions

by liellr Sexer

Vandalism at SUNYA is an ongo—
ing concern of university ad-
ministrators. Each year on campus
costs New York State approxinratc~
ly 575.000 to 580.000. said Director
of Residences Patti Doyle.

According to Residence Director
Rick Miller. many students
presume that SUNYA lras inex-
haustible funds to repair or replace
damaged university property.
Students do not I‘L‘illl‘lL‘ Irow costly

Other administrators have also

. complained about the cost of van-

dalism. According to an .‘lSI’tll‘llClC
(Z—ﬁ-ill). itt February l‘)7‘) SUNYA
police reported that six fire alarm
covets were smashed and 26 attach—
ed metal hammers were stolen from
Livingston Tower on Colonial
Quad within days of their installa-
tiort. littclt alarm cover costs $19.
SUNYA administrators are well
trware of the vandalism problem on
campus, btit none who were ques-
tioned could pinpoint who the van-
dals are. Doyle said that although
too few vandals are apprehended to

make a study of their personality
types. the vandals are a “very small
percentage of students. as well as
outsiders."

Altlrouglt administrators could
trot define the typical vandal, all
agreed that alcohol abuse plays a
direct role in vandalism. Miller ex-
plained that students are “less in
touch with their own actions when
they‘ve been drinking."

()thcr cruises of vandalism are
related to students‘ feelings about
their environment. According ttr
Stevens. trrany students are trit—
corrcerrrcd about vandalism on cam»
pits because they View their dorms
as tlte Slate‘s properly rather than
as their homes. Because of this,
students may be less likely to keep
lounge furniture irr good condition
or prevent others frotn destroying
property. According to the ASP
(5-9-80). last May. I4 students itr
Delanecy Hall on Colonial Quad
saturated the Irall carpeting in a
waterfighl. The bill for replacing
tltc carpeting amounted to over
“.000.

According to Doyle. the ad-
ministration has issued standard
proccdtrrcs for dealing with vari-
dalism. Residcrtcc directors and
residence assistants are responsible
for reporting to the Office of
Residences damage found in their
dorms. Tltcy also try to locate the
person responsible for the tltttttttgc.
if the student who caused the
damage is found. lie is held finan-
cially responsible. and may be refer-
red to Judicial Board. If the
damage is major. costing over $20
to repair. tlte student may be or:
rested.

Hchver. according" to Depart-
ment of Public Safety Director

James Williams. students are rarely
convicted. but are usually awarded
“adjournment in contemplation of
dismissal (A(.‘Ol))."

Willittrrrs said that few students
are apprehended for vandalism
because the incidents usually take
place late at night or during the car-
ly morning when no titre is around.
[Even if witnesses tire present, they
are reluctant to inform on their
fellow students. said Doyle.

The Office of Residences and the
Department of Public Safety have
organized a strident security patrol
for nighttime. btrl according to
Williams. tlte patrol prevents vari—
dttlism only to a “minor degree."
since it concentrates tnore on per-
sonal safety. such as cscorlirrg
women to their dorms.

Aside frorn standard procedures.
tlttring the past two years the atL
ministration has been searching for
methods to prc\":lil vandalism.
rather than waiting until the
damage is done. Since vandalism
has been linked with both alcohol
abuse and students‘ negative at-
titudes towards their environment.
administrators have attacked the
problem of vandalier by enacting
stricter controls on the rise of
alcoholic beverages at tin-campus
parties. and by encouraging
students to imprme their living en-
vironrnerrt.

Wltile the alcohol policy
regulated by SUNYA has not pro-
verr effective. muny administrators
ttre quite pleased with the results of
the Residence Hall improvement
Program (RHII’) which began in
the Fall of 1979.

in October I979 Dean of Student
Affairs Nell Brown announced an
interlnr Alcohol Policy to limit

alcohol consumption and control
overcrowding at tin-campus parties.
anti to hpr crrrb vandalism (ASP.
I0—23-79). The rtcw policy restricted
the anrotirrl of alcohol allowctl at
campus parties to 40 ounces of
beer. ten ottirces of wine. or tltrcc
ounces of liquor per person. or two
kegs of beer per l00 people.

However, because of student
claims llrat the policy was drafted
without strident input. and that it
treated students-as if they were it'-
responsible. tlte policy was revis-
ed (ASP. II-9-79).

The final SUNYA policy set no
limitations on Ihcamount of
alcoholic beverages allowed at cam—
ptrs parties. brtt stated that party
organizers may be held responsible
for damages done in the party area
if the vandal cannot be found
(ASP. Il-30-79). Stevens feels that
the “diluted alcohol policy" has
lost its effectiveness in its revision.
and is not enforced as it should be.

On the other hand. students
donated between 4.000 arttl 5.000
hours of labor to the Rl-iIP. accor—
ding to Doyle. The RHIP. which
originated from the Offices of
Residences and the Students Affairs
Division. has three major com—
ponents:

'0) Section Lounge improvements -
[Each section that proposes an idea
to irrrprove their lounge area is
allotted from $50 to $l00 to buy
materials. If there is little or no uri-
billed damage to the section during
the Fall semester. additional funds
will be allotted to the section in the
spring. Tire sections that show the
most improvements are awarded
prizes. such as a color television set.

1(2) Quad Lonnie improvements

— Students can propose Ideas to

improve any public area on their
quad. such as the iiagroom or the
university lounge. If their proposal
is approved. materials will be pro-
vided. $500 is allotted to elicit quad
for improvement protects. to be
supplemented in the spring pro-
viding vandalism is reduced on the
quad during the fall.

'(3) Quality of Lilt.‘ (lrants - ()ver
$8.000 is available campus-wide to
fund proposals for improving the
residence environment.

Since the program began.
students in the five quads lune corri-
plcted over 90 projects. sttclt as
painting murals on walls and
creating furniture trtrits. Ad-
ministrators feel that these student
projects have increased students'
respect for their living environment.
As of December I980. only one of
the 90 projects completed Iras been
vandalized. said Residence Director
Alan Foote.

Stevens said that the Physical
Plant Department is reinforcing the
RHIP by improving the services of
the maintenance staff. Stevens
assigned additional maintenance
workers to the residence area and
one permanently stationed
maintenance worker to each quad.

“Prompt response to small
maintenance problems...helps corn-
bat vandalism.” Stevens said. He
also assigned a permanently station-
ed groundsrnan to each quad in ad-
dition to the regular crew that ser-
vices ull the quads. Stevens believes
that permanently stationing
workers on each quad will give the
workers a greater feeling of respon-
sibility towards their assigned quad.

Although the RH]? has proven
effective. SUNYA administrators
