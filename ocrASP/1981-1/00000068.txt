it seems there hasn't been a
deartlt of bizarre itovelty items since
the pet r0ck craze was spawned a
few years back. so the newly in-
vented “Silly Pencil" comes as no
surprise.

What’s the silly pencil. you might
ask? inventor Lee Epstein says at
first glance it looks pretty much like
the standard variety. However.
ortcc you have one itt your lirtrtd you
can bend it. twist it. and tie it irt
knots. yet still write witlt it.

The secret. according to Epstein.
is flexible graphite. which reported-
ly took him 10 years to perfect.

Epstein claims that silly pencils
are selling faster than the pet rock
or the hula hoop did irt their hay
days.

llut don‘t be too sure. They retail
for $1.50 for a lS-irtclt size and a
whopping $5 for at 36-inch long
model.

Budget chief Stockman an-
ticipated opposition, and attached
to each of his proposals 3 specula-
tion on “Probable Reaction." He
expected that civil rights groups
would be especially "disquietcd"
by his plan. I

However. he expected support
from “school boards and others
now laboring under the burden of
detailed regulation” and “those
who believe the federal role is to
supply resources. and not to specify
what must be done with those
resources."

Vandalism

continued from page five
cotttinuc to search for more ways to
combat vandalism. Footc. who is
also art advisor to the Colonial
Qltrid Committee on Environment
and Safety. researched ideas. in-
cluding sortie front other univer-
sities. on dealing with vandalism.
'l‘ltcse tire his findings:
'(l) l’I'oiitotiortril Saturation - A
prrhlic awareness program can be
launched to inform students about
vtirirlrtlisrii. Wherever tin act of van-
tltilisrii occurs. it ‘postcr could he
pitirrcd itctrr' Ilic‘ druiiagcd inert
recording the date. little and loca—
tioit of tire incident. and how rrtucli
tltc repairs would cost.

iiin'ir Your lirtviroinricrtl v—- This
progiiun was initiated iit SUNY
Delhi Agriculture ttiid 'lccltnology.
During the yctir' tltc residence lillll
assigns points for each act of van-
dalism lttiscd on tltc estimated cost
of repair. lt‘ ito ortc claims respon-
sibility t‘or' tltc dittttttgc. tltc entire
lutll or section is assigned points. if
the responsible student is located.
he is assigned the poin'ls. If a sut-
deril acquires rt lot of points. his
housing contract may not be renew-
ed for tire following semester.
SUNYA is rtow working on a
similar plan known try,“corirrnon
urea billings." in lliis'pltui. the stu-
dcril coruttrtinity would assume the
cost of repairing dtiritagcs when tltc
irtditidutrlcresponsible for Ute van-
dulisrii is unknown.
'(3) Public Safety Aide Program -
This program is used in tire Stale
Urtiversity College at Buffalo.
Students tire ltired as “Night

monly vriitdrili/cd.

vulvcs awarding prizes to tltc halls

to enter it hall. rttust be escorted by
it resident of that hall. Telephones
placed in hall lobbies are used to in-
t’orrit students tltat a visitor is
waiting to be escorted iii.
0(6) SUNYA could institute inan-
datory security and vandalism
presentations. such as slide shows
to be viewed by all SUNYA
students.
'0) Wirtdow Scrccn Policy - The
