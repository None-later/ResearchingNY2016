Would life seem any more real lo us If we

were placed in a box with no openings lo
look oui at the world. Picfures grace the
walls of our hearfs. as we try in vain to find a
maiching reality to ill Ihese personal whims.
Leaders of mobs use lhefr fnsfghl or lack

of deafh. Picket lines spring up over night Io
prolcsl the loss of right$ we're never really
ever had. Maybe It Is lusf as well our parents
came before us. we don'l seem to know
anything abouf ourselves either.
I No more reasons to cheer. the season Is

consenled lo play Ihe clock oul. in panic and
hassle have we stumbled Info what we do not
