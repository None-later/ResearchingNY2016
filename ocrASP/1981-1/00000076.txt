points) had a l4 point second half
to bring Albany back from a 12

Players Aren’t Asking Too Much

NEW YORK. N.Y. (Al’) Marvin
Miller wants baseball fans to know
tltat major league players aren't
asking for anything more than what
they already have under their basic
agreement with the cltth owners.

Usually, the fans get the impres-
siott that the players wattt
something." Miller. executive
director of the Major League
l’lHYcrs Association. said Wednes-
day. discussing the possibility of a
strike over the free agent compensa-
tion issue.

“The fans always Want to know.
‘What do the players want now?‘
The answer is that the players want
nothing.“ Miller said.

The players want to keep the cur»
rent free agent rule allowing cont-
pettsution limited to an amateur
draft choice. Owners wunt compen»
sation from a team signing a
Drcmlum free agent in the forth of at
major league player not listed on a
protected roster of 15 players.
Premium is defined as ti free agent
chosen in the re-entry draft by at
least eight clubs.

Negotiations on the question

pected to intplemenl their propostll

The Danes played without tltc

services of George Archible and lost
both Dan O'Donnell and Everett to
sprained ankles midway in the
game.

"Everett averages 20 points and
O'Donnell is really playing well.
When he went out the tide really
turned.” said Skeel.

Union played a good all-around
game against the Danes, not letting
Albany play their own game, accor-
ding to Skeel. For the Danes.
Thomas had a great evening. at:-
counting for 23 points.

But the difference, Skeel said,
took place at the foul line. There
the Dutchmen had 16 points alone.

“The foul line killed us. it was an
unbelievable difference," said the

Football Coach Dooley
To Become Georgia AD

ATHENS. (in. (AP) Georgia
Coach Vince Dooley, who directed
his football team to the national
‘chumpionship last season. now is in
charge of the university‘s etttire
athletic program.

Dooley had shared the position
of 'ttthletic director with Reid
Parker since July l979. when Joel
Envcs retired. Dooley said he has
asked Parker to remain at Georgia
for another year as a consultant.

ltt announcing the changes
Wednesday. Dooley also named his
former Auburn teammate. Lee
Hayley, as an associate athletic
director at Georgia. Hayley resign-
ed carlier Wednesday as athletic
director at Auburn.

Hayley‘s availability was the
tnttitt reason the cltange was made
now, Dooley said, because the cont-
plex world of college athletics
makes it impopssible for one person

to handle botlt the athletic director
and head football coach jobs.

"As long as l'm totally involved
in coaching, there is no way i can
give all my attention to the position
of athletic director." Dooley said.

Hayley will assume his new duties
July 1, bill will begin working on a
limited basis ltcrc within the next
few weeks. He will take over many
of the responsibilities currently be-
ing handled by Dooley and Parker.

Parker said the clntnges at
Georgia are “in keeping with the
agreement made almost two years
ago when the present administrative
organization was developed. The
plans were for me to fill the role of
athletic director for administration
for a short period of time, allowing
Conch Dooley uttd the department
.to prepare for him to eventually
serve as the single athletic director
and head football coach."
