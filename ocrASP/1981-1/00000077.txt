Hartwiclc Gives Tired Albany'A .96- 76 Drubbing

by Bob Bell-tion

ONEONTA — A weak and weary
Albany State basketball team
played its fifth game in the last nine
days Wednesday night — their third
on the road.

Perhaps they should've stayed
home.

Worn down by the rigors of the
most exhausing stretch in titeir 24
game schedule. the Danes were not
big enough. strong enough. nor
quick enough to handle a talented
Hartwick College team. and were
shellacked by the Warriors. 96-76.
at Hartwick’s Binder Physical
Education Center.

A patient Albany offense was
able to penetrate the Hartwick l-3-i
zone defense early. with four of the
five starters getting inside hoops.
and staying basket-for-basket with
their Division ll opponents for the
first nine minutes. But the Warriors
changed to a 2-3 zone for the rest of
the game, and forced Albatry to
shoot from the perimc'

“i felt their outside shooting was
suspect." said Hartwie'k head
basketball coaclt Nick Lambros.

He was right as tlte Dartcs chl
on to connect on only 30 of their 79
field goal attempts for a dismal 38
percent for the game. and 34 per-
cent in the second half.

On the other side, Hartwick hit
an efﬁcient 66 percent of their shots
(39-59) behind guard Tlnt O‘urlctt‘s
sizzling i3-l7 effort.

With Albany down by only fottr
(20-16) in the first half. Hartwick
took off on the first of its many big
scoring sprees. putting iii to. sitrrt-
ting the Danes out for almost three
minutes. and opened a i4 point
bulge. O'Brien got six of those. on
the way to a career high 35 points.

The margin got as close as eigltt
at halftime. 36-28. bill the Warriors
went on a l3-0 binge early in the sc-
cond half. and Albany could not

“We had some good shots in the
ﬁrst half." said Albany head
basketball coach Dick Sauers.
“With the shots we had. we
shouldn've been tied. Then, it got
away from us right away in the se-
cond half."

indeed it did. Albany tried to
press Hartwick. but the Warrior
backcourt of O’Brien and Larry
Carpenter made a shambles of
Albany’s strategy. finding open
men downcourt all too often for un-

molested baskets.

"We weren’t executing the press
very well." Sauers said.

“They’re susceptible," Lambros
said about Albany's pressure
defense. “if you get it past the front
line.

“Albany was missing," he con-
tinued. "We were getting the ball.
filling the lanes, and were going."

Hartwiek found tremendous suc-
cess at that, connecting for 38
points on fast breaks. When sub

Doug Weaver threw down a
dunk (one of four in the game by
Hartwlek). the Warriors took a
93-60 lead — their biggest of the
game — and Lambros emptied his
bench.

From that point. Albany
outscored Hartwick 16-3 (including
the last seven points of the game —
five by Glenn Phillips), making the
final tally comparatively respec-
table.

Women Swimmers

by Larry Kahn
Continuing their string of
phenomenal performances. the

Albany State women‘s swimming' '

and diving team completely
dominated a quadrangular meet last
Saturday. defeating Oswego
(83-59). Hartwick (93-42). and
Oneonta (97-34) to raise their
season output to 9-5-1.

Albany swimmers broke t‘otrr
team records in the meet. in addi-
tion. l0 individual swimmers rttrd
one diver have qtralificd for the
state meet irt thncsco next
weekend.

. "l‘m proud and eluted with the

'tcam." said Albany women‘s swim-
mingcoach Sarah liingham. "it‘s
outstanding — they‘ve really come
a long wrty. since October.
Evcryonc's times have just dropped
tremendously."

in the 200 yard Medley Relay the
quartet of Judy King. Lattriunn
Baines. licth Larson. and Lisa
Sotnck wrts good for a first place
finish irt a team record 2:06.55.

King and Larson also provided
the Dane ortc-two punch in the 50

second. respectively. King clocked

it through an up and down season
where they've lost to Oneonta and
Union (both beaten by Albany). yet
managed to give the Danes the
drubbing they did Wednesday
night.

“We're a funny team. We’ve had
some problems." Lambros said.
“But we can play.

“i still feel we've got a shot."
Lambros said. referring to the
NCAA Eastern Regional Tourna-
ment — where the Warriors have
participated for each of the last
eight seasons.

“We got behind Union. and they
held the ball. Union ptrt a clinic on
against us.” ire said about their
74-65 loss to the Dutchmen.

But Wctirrcstlay. it was Hart-
wick‘s turn to ptrt on the clirtic.
Running their fast brcak alrtrost at
will. and utilizing their tremendous
ircigitt advantage (two starters were
6-7). the Warriors completely
dorrrittatcd play. and never let an
emotionally and physically fatigued
Albany learn get their own game go-
ing.

"1 think they‘re a little tired."
Satrcrs said of his Danes. who were
coming off an intense and inspired
performance Monday night against
Union. “i think that took a lot otrt
of them. You can‘t emotionally
gearthcse gtrys up night after night.

“l'vc been telling my team that
every game is a step closer to the
NCAA‘s." Strucrs said. "This was
a step backward."

And although the game has no
hearing on the conference stan-
dings. it could effect Albany‘s
number cigitt national ranking —
the first time this season that the
Danes iravc been itt tltc top.ten
(they‘ve been as itiglt as thirteenth).

But Albany has not beaten Hart-
wick iii 10 years. and the two teams

administration will go down ‘in
history as beittg far crtteler than the
Nixon administration."

“l-Ic's cutting areas that directly
affect tltc ltcalth and safety of the
people. kccpitrg intact corporate
subsidies. artd making new policies
that increase the number of big
bttsincss‘ privileges." Nader said.

“The crtrclty of tire Reagan ad-
ministration is not likely to be
taped," Ire continued. “it won‘t
have to be because it won‘t be
secret. It will be apparent."

The consumer advocate attacked
tltc media for withholding news and
conducting irrrrdcqrrrrtc campaign
corerrtgc.

Nader suid l‘lrt' New York Timur
"i\ an arrogant. srnrrg institution

that ignores local news. censors lct-
ters to the editor. and panders to
preferential leaks from official
sources."

Regarding the Reagan campaign,
Nader said that he "has never seen
a ntore sttccessfrrl quarantine of a
candidate by the press.

“(Reagan's campaign aids) kept
him from the press because lie is so
uninformed,” Nader continued.
."Titcrc must he a broader and more
corrtprchensivc coverage of the
campaign."

Nader told the college-age crowd
that "so tttarty new efforts start on
college campuses" attd that
students have sctcral advantages irr

tion attached to the resolution
prepared by Senate Nominations

Kendall liirr.

'l‘itc by-luw umcndmcnt calls for
the reduction of graduate sttrdcut
scars frorn II‘ to 3. with the
replacements of tiresc eight seats to

This revision would give the

would permanently retain 25 senate

liirr explained that another part

”\\‘c how to make this work."
Montrrrrrrro said. “bccnrrsc this is a

structure of student representation
through it simple resolution.

A simple resolution requires only
at 20 percent qtrortrttr of tire voting
faculty instead of the current 40
percent quorum now required to
make it try-law antcrtdtttcnt. Birr
said.

liirr trotcd that tltc rcsoltrtiort and
amendment were “shaped-by the
corrtrttittcc using the results of the
two advisory rcfcrcnda and otltcr
dnttt.

“lioth options outlittcd iii the
December rcfcrcttdurtt have coll~
sidcrable support. but in the view of
tire cottttttittec. it is trrtlikely that
any single option could successfully
win faculty approval." he predicted
in a letter to faculty tnernbers.

Birr emphasized the importance
ofa40 percent quorum of faculty in
attendance at the meeting.
