Governor Carey‘s proposal to
give wine and liquor licenses to
supermarkets has met with angry
opposition from liquor store
owners, and mixed reaction from
supermarkets.

Wine and liquor is currently sold
in supermarkets in California and
lllinois. while states such as
Massachusetts allow supermarkets
to sell only wine.

“I think Carey is shooting front
the hip on this one," said Director
of Consumer Services for Price
Chopper,‘Sue Ann Richco. “if he
does decide to think this proposal
out, i think he will drop it entire-
ly.“

“We sell wine in Massachusetts
with no problems," she continued.
“and wine is a natural with the food
we sell, but selling liquor would be
going one step too far. We have a li-
quor problem in this country. and i
think that selling hard liquor would
only compound the problem."

Richco added, “We are a
business that depends on young
people, and we can't let seventeen-
ycar-olds at the register sell
whiskey. i don’t think they would
be able to handle it."

William MeDivitt, Legislative
Chair of The State Federation of
Package Stores, angrily criticized
the Governor‘s proposal. “This is
an ill-advised proposition made off
the cuff and without much
thought," he said. “Well over 50
percent of our liquor stores are ad-
jacent to supermarkets. and l’d say
two thirds of the liquor stores in the
state will go out of business if this
gets passed."

When asked to respond to the ac-
cusation on the part of some liquor
store owners in Albany that large
New York wineries such as Taylor
and Monsieur Henri are pushing for
supermarket sales, MeDivitt said,
“i haven’t seen any of the big win-
crics lobbying for this in Albany.
but the New York State Food Mer-
chants Association has been active-
ly campaigning for it."

The Food Merchants Association
is an organization of large and small
grocery stores in New York State,
of which Price Chopper is a
member. Price Clioppcr’s Richco
said that wltile the association had
campaigned for supermarkets sales
two years ago, they are no longer
lobbying for the proposal.

“Our activities were part of an

 

overall drive to‘try to improve sales
of New York wines. We wanted to
begin supermai‘ket sales to try to
stop the influx of California wines,
which have really damaged the wine
industry here."

McDivitt also said selling liquor
in supermarkets would present
security problems that the stores
would not be able to handle.
“Anyone has a right to be in a
supermarket," he said. “A known
alcoholic will get thrown out ofa li-
quor store, but if he puts a bottle of
wine in a shopping cart, he is one in
a thousand customers. and will
have an easier time getting his
alcohol."

Carmen Treffilletti. General
Manager of Star Markets for the
Albany Area, also felt that selling li-
qttor in supermarkets would create
security problems. “Shoplifting
would be a big problem, just as it is
now," he said. “We would go by
experience. After we set ourselves
up to sell wine and liquor we would
try to adapt ourselves to try to stop
the shoplifting.“ he said.

Trcl'illetti echoed Richco when he
said Star Markets would favor scll-
. . . . . .
mg wmc but not liquor. “Wine is a

iieense. but i don't like liquor. it
takes a lot more wine than liquor to
make someone sick. But if everyone
else went along with the proposal. i
guess we would too.”

Both Trefﬁlletti and Richco said
Carey's proposal would put most li-
quor stores out of business, but
Trefﬁlletti added. “We couldn't
hurt them that much because small
liquor stores are on the way out
anyway. With these large liquor
stores that do a big volume. most
small stores are outsold as it is."

The governor‘s proposal has been
criticized by bar and liquor store
owners as being an invitation to in-
creased alcoholism in New York.
John Shear. Director of the
Alcoholism Receiving Center at
Albany Medical Center, said wine
and liquor sales in supermarkets
would boost his business
significantly. "If this goes through
we'll have them hanging by the

r

 

K

logical extension of our beer

  

rafters in here."

Shear said that since the
legislature removed price minimums
on wine, the resulting price "war"
in New York has brought 20 percent
more cases into the Receiving
Center every day. “We're ﬁlled to
no percent capacity in here every
night, and who knows how many
we'll get if they sell the stuff in
supermarkets."

Adolescent drinking has also in-
creased drastically according to
Shear. "We get fifteen-year-old
girls and boys in here now. We
never used to see them that young a
few years ago. With the low prices
on wine. now they drink quarts of
wine instead of pints."

"There will be a huge increase in
alcoholism if Carey makes this
law,“ he continued. “Recovered
alcoholics have it tough enough
without seeing Old Grand [)ad on
the shelves along with the beer."
