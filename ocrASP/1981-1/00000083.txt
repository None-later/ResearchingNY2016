novcrs. “It seemed that most of my
points came on fast breaks." said
Thomas. “The coach (Albany J.V.
head coach Rick Skcel) had me play
on tltc wing and we made a lot of
fast breaks."

The 13 turnovers committed by
the Red Dragons is indicative of
Onconta’s inexperience. according
to Onconttt J.V. head coach Hal
'Chnsc. "I have two or three guys
who haven‘t played high school
hall.“ Cltnsc added.

lixccpt for the final 6:30 of thc
first half, the game was never really
close. The Dimes jumped out curly
to it 12-2 lead, easily pcnctmting
Onconlu's 2-2-1 zone dcfcnsc. But
in thc final minutes of the half, the
Danes szIw thnt lead diminished as
Oncontn scored 10 straight points

on Albany's pressure defense. “We
pressed :1 lot throughout- the
game," said Skccl.

Going into halftime Albany lead
by the slim difference of one
basket. 32-30. That difference was
quickly made up as Tom Pctrowski
(10 points) opened the second half
scoring with only 21 seconds gone
by. But Albany. over the next nine
minutes, outscored Oncontn 26-13
and the Red Dragons never
recovered.

The Dunes flirted with It 20-point
lead late in tile game on Craig
Kinn's followup shot that liiatlL‘ the
score 84-64. However, a last second
shot hy Mark Sheppard was good to
~kccp the Red Dragons from lllL‘ rut
of a 20-point loss.

On the other hand, according to
Chase, the size of his team's roster.
consisting of only nine players, was .
definitely a deterring factor. “We ‘
haVcn't got any depth. We did not
have many guys. Albany was runn-
ing them in and out.” Chase said.
“You do what you can with what
you’ve got."

But as far as Skeel was concern-
ed, the .rcal key was Albany's
defense. "We played good defense
and that was the key. When you
play dcfcnse'llkc that, it becomes
your offense." said the Danes'
coach.

Best exemplifying Albany's
defense on Saturday was the play of
guard Curl Askew, who took on the
assignment of guarding Pctrowski
in the second half. “He's a good
shorter." Askew said of Pctrowski
(a former varsity player). "He had
to stay. in his place. We played a

«nod defensive game."

was that the Danes not only possess

The gcncrIIl consensus of the

IIIch will not he that iIIIportant.
Thcy till seem to be getting ready
