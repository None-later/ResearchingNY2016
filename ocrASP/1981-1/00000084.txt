St. Michael’s In Finale

by Larry Kuhn '

A red hot Albany State women’s
swimming and diving team added
fuel to their fire on Saturday, over.
whclming a weak St. Michael's
squad in University Pool, 97-38.
Albany swimmers won 13 of the 16
events to put the finishing touches
on their 10-5-1 dual mect season.

The Danes will try to carry some
of their recent momentum to
Gcncsco for the State Champion-
ships which begin on Thursday.

in Saturday's meet some of
Albany's times were a little slower
than usual because of the weaker
competition. "When you're beating
a team by those kinds of scores, it‘s
hard to put in a good perfor-
mance." explained Albany
women's swimming coach Sarah
Bingham.

Despite that fact. two Albany
school records were brokctt. Shcila

In the diving competition. Joan
Meiklcham continued to excel. 1n
the one-meter diving required
event. she attempted an inwarddivc
in the pike position and received
scores of seven. eight, and nine. A
score of nine is very hard to cor
by in collegiate diving.

“it's almostunhcard of until you
g'ct to Olympic competition -— it's
very rare." noted Bingham.

The State meet is next up for the
Dane swimmers and eleven pcoplc

26-tcam ﬁeld. but she is confident
lhcy will improve on last year's 19th
placc finish.

“Any otltcr team at the Slalcs wc

rcally gct cooking. we could place
as high as eighth place. Right now.

 

in addition. five relay teams have
qualiﬁed and their performances 1
will be critical in the team ﬁnish as
relay pointslcount double for the
team. Bingham feels that this could
be an advantage for the Danes.

"i feel overall that my relays are

Jnger than my individual events
or the most part," she explained.

we’re aiming at the top twclvc."
Being among thc top six com-
petitors in each event is the goal
that the swimmers will be striving
for. Bingham feels that Albany's
best chances for that mark will be
from Mciklcham in the diving. King
in the 50-yard Backstroke. and
Lauriann Baiitcs in the 50-yard and
loo-yard Breast Stroke. She also '
noted that Brown had qualiﬁed in
