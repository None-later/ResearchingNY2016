SUNY’S Tuition History: Hikes Never Prevented

by Bruce Fox

Art examination ot'SUNY history
shows that student groups ltave
never been able to stop a proposed
SUNY tuition ltike.

Further. of the five tttitiott ltikes
proposed since 1963. the year
SUNYA became a university
center. three were at the request of

Governor Hugh L. Carcv.

ding cttt or a tttitiott ltike or bottt
during five of his seven years itt of—
I'ice. The two years lte did not make
such proposals were 1975. his first
year irt office, and 1978. when he
was up for te-election.

('arey's record of support for
higher edttcatiott is in stark contrast
to that of Governor Nelson A.
Rockefeller. _

Rockefeller was elected governor
itt 1958. ltt 1963. SUNY tuition was
$400 per year. That figure remained
uttcltanged utttil 1971.

The '60's was a period of tremen-
dous growth for SUNY. increases
itt sales taxes and banking taxes in
New York State generated enor-
mous revenue. enabling Rockefeller
to almost single-ltandedly create the
entire 64-campus system.

During Rockefeller‘s 15 years as
governor. the state budget increased
frottt $2 billion to more than $8
billion. Mttclt of that money went
to higher education.

Tire tturttber of college students
enrolled in New York State increas-
ed durittg that period from 38.tX)()
to 246.000.

to 1971. the tnttjority of
Rockefeller‘s budget was earmark-
ed l'or education. SUNY's ap-
propriatiott was increased tttore
than $40 million. Despite this. addi»
tional money was needed to main-
tain the SUNY construction ftrttd.

(in January 29. 1971. the SUNY

Board of Trustees voted to raise tni— ,

tiott from $400 to $550, with a
similar ltikc platttted for 1973.

The tuition increase that year
went virtually unnoticed. No angry
letters or editorials graced the pages
of the ASP. No massive lobbying
efforts were organized. Students. it
seemed. were too busy protesting
the war in Vietnam.

The first real outcry against rising
tuition oecured itt 1972. when the
SUNY Board of Trustees approved
a tuition ltike for the second year irt
a row.

Ernest L. Boyer. then chancellor
of the SUNY system. said the ltike

New tuition rates were set at $650

Students Will Lobby Legislators

by Judie Eisenberg

The Albarty Student Union
(ASU) and SA are joining tltc Stu—
dent Associatiort of the State
University (SASU) this Monday to
lobby against proposed SUNY tui-
tiort ltikes.

According to SASU Legislative
Director Beth Ziegler. students
representing tttost SUNY schools
will gather itt front of the
Legislative Office Building
dowtttowtt as part of a continuing
campaign against the proposed in-
creases. 'l'hey trope to convince
legislators to raise approximately
$20 million in ttcetled revenues front
state funds itutead of increased tui-
tiort. '

'l‘lte lixccutive (‘ornntittce ol' the
SUNY Board of Trustees passed a

recommendation February 11 to
raise undergraduate tuition by $151)
attd graduate tuition by $300. On
February 19, Governor Hugh 1..
Carey amended the state btrdgct to
allow SUNY to use additional
revenue received through tuition in-
creases for SUNY. programs and
services. The state legislature must
decide whetltcr or ttot to approve
this allocation of funds by the April
1 budget deadline.

“We wattt the expenditure side to
rctttain the saute." Ziegler said.
“The tttottcy is going towards pro-
grams we need, such as restoring
400 faculty positions and retaining
free rooms for residence assistants.
But this money should come front
the state."

ASU metnber

Altttt Weitter

agreed. “We're rtot asking for
restoration of programs lost itt the
past.~We just want to maintain what
we ltave. We don't wattt public
higher education to erode any fur-
ther than it already has."

Weiner maintained that tltc
March 2 lobby day will be a show of
student strength. where constituents
cart pttt pressure on their legislators.

A SASU organized legislative
conference this weekend will bring
people frotn various SUNY schools
together to share information and
plan strategies concerning the figltt
to retaitt current tuition rates.

Also. a meeting will be held at
7:30 pttt this Sunday irt tltc Fireside
Lounge to dispense information
and organize interested students for
the lobby day.

rnoatted the apathy of SUNYA's
14.000 students who were “more in-
tercstcd itt dope titan itt politics."

Ottt of art expected crowd of

2.000 SUNY students. only 800
rallied at the Capitol that year.
Legislators that were ttot “ in con-
ference" told lobbyists they felt
sympathetic but there was “nothing
they could do."
. On March 24. the ASP ran a
survey that asked the question,
“How does the tuition ltike affect
you?" Some students said they
would need to work part-time.
some said they would take out
loans. and some said they were
seniors and didn‘t care. Most.
however. echoed the sentitnents of
Bernadette Bosscrt. a freshtnatt on
Alttttttti Quad. who said. “My
.parents pay for my education. so I
don‘t ltave to worry."

No tuition ltike oectrred again urt-
til 1976, Carey's second year as
governor.

Citing New York State‘s fiscal
crisis. for which the ttcar bankrupt-
cy of New York City was largely
responsible, Carey called for a
SUNY budget cut of $51 ntillion.
He requested. in addition to this
cut. a tuitiott ltike and a dorm rate
trike of ttt least $100 each.

Boyer denounced Carey‘s pro-
posals as being “severely harmful to
SUNY.“ Others said that Carey

was intent upon "tearing dowrt
wltat Rockefeller built."

As a result of the cut. 1.000 facul-
ty attd staff positions were lost
statewide. Most catnpttscs phased
out cttlirc programs. hoping to
maintain the quality of those that
were left. SUNYA lost five masters
and eight undergraduate degree
programs. including the school of
nursing.

Meanwhile. the legislature in-
troduced hills to cut the SUNY
budget even ntore. On March 16,
10.000 students participated in a
ruass demonstration at the Capitol.
Violence erupted, however. when
200 students surged through police
lines. smashed glass doors. and
swarmed into the second floor of
the building. Several arrests were
made.

The SUNY Board of Trustees in-
creased tuition that year to $750 for
lower division and $900 for upper
division. Board President Elizabeth
Luce Moore said she “deeply
regretted" the necessity of the ac-
tion. SASU President Bob
Kirkpatrick called the board's deci-
sion "irresponsible."

budget. this time by approximately
$40 billion. Tuition was not raised.

tions were ettt. The board of
