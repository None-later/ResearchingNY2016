‘ Colleges To Cut Back Enrollment In The [‘80’s

(CPS) in defiance of worries that
drastic enrollment drops in the
19805 would tempt colleges into try-
ing to lure any old warm. tuition-
paying bodies to their campuses. a
large number of schools are actually
starting to limit their enrollments in
the face of what one university
business manager calls “the budget
squeeze of the eighties.”

Unexpectedly large enrollment
increases — national enrollment is
up 3.2 percent over fail. l979. ac-
cording to the National Center for
Education Statistics — have gravely
strained campus services across the
country, exacerbating housing shor-
tages, classroom overcrowding, and
ttndcrstaffing problems.

But the money pools where col-
lcgcs would ordinarily go to help
pay for expanding campus services
have largely dried up.

Doug Norman. information
director at the University of Ten-
ncsscc. says the money simply isn‘t
available to alleviate tltcsc pro-
blems, especially at state univer-
sities which rely most heavily on
state funding.

“The cost of everything —
library materials. utilities, facttlty
—— is going up. but state funding is
not." Norman explains. “The only

Task Force To Study

by Julienne llostlc

To help deal with the special
needs and problems of lesbian and
gay students an campus and
statewide, SA has formed a Lesbian
and Gay Task Force.

SA Vice President Brian Levy
said that problems of gays at
SUNYA were to be originally
handled by the Minority Task
Force.

According to Gay attd Lesbian
Alliance President Mike McPartlin.
Affirmative Action, whose main
concern 'has been problems of
racism and sexism. is not required
to handle issues concerning gays.
Questions about student attitudes
towards gays on campus have not
been answered by the Affirmative
Action Office at SUNYA in the
past. hc added.

Mcl’artlin~ has been appointed
head of thc ncw task force.

Affirmative Action Officer
Gloria DcSole said that her office
was "in favor of all efforts on cam-
pus toward cquanimity." She add-
cd that she has been accessible to
respond to the problems of gay
stutlénts on campus.

I Last spring. SUNYA President
Vincent ()‘Lcary added a clause to
the university’s anti-discrimination
policy stating that the university
would not discriminate on the basis
of sexual or affcctional preference.
Mcl’artlin said that there has been
little publicity about the new policy
and that an informal task force
survey indicated that only 50 per-

theoretically means less costs for
the university."

indeed. Tennessee‘s Board of
Trustees has decided that Ten-
nessee's Knoxville campus should
cut enrollment by l,000 students
the fall of l9Bl.

Norman adds the trustees made
the decision only after the state
assured them that the university’s
appropriations would not dimlnislt
along with enrollment. As at most
state schools, Tennessee's ap~
propriations were based on enroll-
ment until last fall.

Statc funding also became a par-
iicularly had problem last year for
Cleveland State University (CSU),
says Admissions Director Richard
Dickerman. when his office mis-
judged fall enrollment. The state
based its appropriations on CSU's
enrollment predictions. as it ltas
done every year. but when a record
19.250 — over a thousand more
than CSU had predicted — showed
up. Dickcrman says. “we knew we
goofcd.“

CSU ended up with a three per—
cent crtt in appropriations, wlIcn it
actually should have had an in-
crease based on the number of

cent of students were aware of
O'Leary's statement.

"There is a lack of evidence that
the university is committed to this,"
he said. The survey also showed
that 50 percent of students would be
opposed to having a homosexual
roommate.

McPartlin noted that training ses-
sions on this problem are not re-
quired for residence assistants
(RA’s). “RA’s should have to take
these classes. it’s an issue they'll
have to be aware of." he said.

According to Associatc Director
of Residence/Programming David
Jenkins. RA’s are required to take a
first semester corrrsc which focuses
primarily on basic communication
and counselling skills.

Jenkins said that “homosexuality

students. _

Dickcrman vows that he'll never
let enrollment reach that number
again. He says it is impossible to
receive additional state monies in
the middle of the year. so all the
university can do is "accommodate
all the students that are here." in
spite of a faculty that Dickcrman
describes as “rather Shorthanded in
areas.“

Cleveland's situation is hardly
unique. as more and universities ad-
mit to having been caught by the
“squeeze.” Officials at San Diego
State University (SDSU) misjudged
what their fall enrollment would be,_
and found themselves with 6.(X)0
“extra” students.

Denied additional funds by the
state legislature. SDSU President
Thomas Dcy now aims to cut
500-700 students from the rolls to
hrittg the school's total down to
24.500 by next fall.

The University ot Arkansas has
decided tltc best way to limit enroll-
ment is to raise admission start-
dards. Univcrsity President James
Martin told a Sludcnt Services
group last tnontlt to pay special at-
tention to applicants who graduated
in the top 40 or 50 percent of their
ltigh school classes.

Gay Issues

is not ncccssarily covered." but if a
student is having a prohlctn related
to homosexuality. the kind of skills
an RA learns apply to this situation
as well.

O'l.cary provided means for gays
to ﬁle grievances of sex discrimina-
tion with the university. The inten-
tion of this was to. place these
grievance procedures in the hands
of academic ad dormitory councils.
Documentation of the facts.
however. are necessary before any
complaints of discrimination based
on sex cart be brought to the coun-
cils.

According to Mcl’artlin. “There
has been no attempt on tltc part of
the university to gel documenta—
tion." The task force plans to
discuss this problem with SUNY
Chancellor Clifton Wharton. Jr.

Martin complained that Arkan-
sas' enrollment rose three percent
last year. while funding remained
the same. He hopes to see at least a
three percent enrollment decline by
next fall.

Until self-imposed cuts can be
made, crowded classrooms —
especially in the more popular
departments — pose the biggest
problem for administrators. says
Peter Flnwn. president of the
University of Texas-Austin.

Flawn told'a General Faculty
meeting last fall that “very large
enrollments present us with a very
fortnidablc challenge" that merits
"another look" at a plan to limit
admissions of freshmen and
transfers.

Based on the problems of high
slttdcltl-lo-lcacllcr ratios and
students‘ difficulty in getting
classes. Flnwn recommended that
the schools of engineering and
business limit cnrollrncnl next fall.
The schools of nursing. law, phar-
macy and architecture already im-
posc limits.

[Earnest Gloyntt. dean of 'l‘cxas’
cttginccring collcgcs. agrees that
funding and paying faculty is the
biggest problem.

“Most of my better faculty could

    
    

leave the university tomorrow and
double their salary." Gloyna told
the Daily Texan.

CSU's Dickerman agrees that
"engincering professors are a scarce
commodity because universities
can‘t pay them enough. He points
out that someone with a bachelor of
engineering degree can easily earn
more in his ﬁrst. job than an
engineering Ph.D. can earn
teaching. The result. say both
'Gloyna and Dickerman. is large
classes and less “student-teacher in-
teraction.”

Even when a school can ﬁnd ad-
ditional teachers. chkerman says,
it will often opt to cope with crowd-
.ed classrooms until enrollment
might decline naturally within the
next few years.

"We have problems in stafﬁng
freshmen engineering and math
classes." he says, “but we’re reluc-
tartt to add staff because we are so
certain that enrollment will go

down in the eighties. If our school
grows to accommodate the present
increase. then we'll be too big wltcn
the population goes down and We‘ll
have extra staff and extra facilities
that will require unnecessary wages
and upkeep."

Food Poisoning MightNot Be Culprit

by Dr. Janet Hood

Often confused with “food
poisoning." acute gastroenteritis
occurs from time to time on cam-
puScs and in other semi-closed
population groups. When there are
many cases at one time, people
often wrongly conclude that it has
been cause by bad food. This is
understandable, since the symp-
toms arc primarily nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea.

Acute gastroenteritis is second in
frequency to the common cold in

the United States. Although stif-
fcrcrs feel as if they're going to die
and often wish they would. the it-
lness is usually self—limited in

the bacteria that commonly caused
similar afﬂictions could not be in-
dicted in every case of intestinal
upset and that in these severe, but
self-limited cases the cause might be
more likely a viral agent. in the last
[0 years. it was established through
new techniques that no long rc—
quircd growth of the virus in vitro
in order to make an identification.
that there are two major groups of
virttscs causing the symptoms. in
thc college-age student it is the Nor-
walk or Norwalk typc viruses, so
named as the identification was first
made in an outbreak in Norwalk.
()ltio. A radio itntttunoassay
method allowing identification of
the causative agent in feces. as well
as rncasttrcmcnt of scrum antibody
in those who have had the infection

has added to the ability to study the
disease attd rapidly test large
numbers of samples.

Unlike the common cold. for
which there are so many different
causative viruses (more titan l00 ac-
cording to the very latest figures).
gastroenteritis in college-age people
is caused largely by this one
organism or very closely associated
types.

These viruses are transmitted by
the fecal-oral route. Half the pa-
tients shed virus in their stools for

 

72 hours at least. How can tltc
disease sprcad so fast and explosive-
ly on a college campus as to be cott-
fused with food poisoning? Pro-
bably bccattsc there is a very rapid
secondary spread through air-borne
viral particles from nerosolizcd
votnitus.

Finally. there is a paradox that
sets Norwalk virus apart from other
viruses. Although antibodies rise
after infection. they do not

confer immunity. Actually the
presence of antibody and the ability
to generate it render the individual
more likely to repeated illness
rather than less likely as is usual
with viral infections.

So when you develop vomiting,
abdominal cramping. headache.
nausea. diarrhea. muscle pains,
weakness and low grade fever. you
can obtain assistance at the Student
Health Service with medications
and procedures that will relieve the
symptoms. though essentially the it-
lncss must run its course.

Don't always jump to the conclu-
sion that you have necessarily eaten
bad food. in fact. we can be very
grateful that on our campus where
l.954.l40 meals are served during 30
school weeks by a staff involving
720 individuals. we have never had
a proven outbreak of food poison-
Ing.
