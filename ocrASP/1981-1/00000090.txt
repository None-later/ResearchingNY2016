been transformed into a gigantic Whitefish. "The Meta-
morphowitz" died at the typewriter.

And Joanne discussed the humorous possibilities of a sat-
irical piece entitled "Albanyuhly Kind of Town". real-
izing only later that a title doth not a column make,

nor a magazine.

But wath cloth a magaline Make? Thus Wl‘ present a beginner's
guide to Aspects writing.

1. Rock reviews: Practice how many times you can fit the
phrases "hardudriving". "definitely hot", "danceable". “rock-
in'". "Thursday night at J.b-'c“. “solid sets", and "heavy
riffs". Leave off the last letter of every other word. and re—
place with an apostrophe. Type the whole thing in under ten
minutes, and end with "Check 'em out“.

 

 

2. MovieSl Hate everything that's good, and praise to the stars
every flick made by some obscure Bulgarian director WhO'Ei dist—
ributor gave out free press passes. Avoid grammar and the lut-
est clothing fashions.
