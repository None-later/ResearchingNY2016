the turtle’s death was the store's fault.

(Incidentally, 1 am a biology major with a
particularly concentrated interest in her-
patoiogy, the study of reptiles). Having
owned a turtle back home for almost ten
years now, I can safely say that only the
best of care was given that turtle.

When asked what he was going to do
with Cocoa in the mean time, Tom said
“1'” freeze him and then have a llcr-
patologist take a look at him." Well tilts
sounded a bit too troublesome for a thriv-
ing business — contesting the loss of a nine

dollar item. The mercenary act this man .

committed was less titan dcspondcnl corn-
parcd to the merciless slaughter of the
animal.

James Robinson. a Delmar veterinarian,
was supposed to inspect our dcccuscd turtic
on Tuesday. February 24. On Wednesday,
Feb. 25, we called Pet World and spoke
again to Tom who told us that under no cir-
cumstances would he refund our money or
even replace our turtlc on an even ex-
change. When asked whether Dr. Robinson
had actually inspected the turtle; Tom said,
“No'n. .

To add background. my suitcmulcs pur-
chased a fish tank, gravel, filters and ten
dollars worth of fish last semester. Within
two months, the ten dollars worth of ﬁsh
died of unknown causes. When asked
when: the fish were purchased, my
suitcmates responded “that new Store, Pet
World, at the Norlhway Mall."

Kangaroo Court

To the Editor:

Wednesday night, I appcurcd bct'orc lhc
University Judicial Board as a witness for a
defendant in a particular case. chcr before
have i sccn such a group that. ill their at-
tempt at fairncss, did more injustice than
justice to the defendant.

Besides myself and one other witness, the
dcfcndallt and the otllcr witnesses, totalling
eight people, did not know any of tile rulcs
of parliamentary procedure, nor did the
board make any attempt at lhc outset to ex-
plain these rules, even in a modified form.
The witnesses could not ilavc known that
they Wcrc speaking out of turn and at one
point they were threatened with expulsion
from the hearing if tllcy continued to speak
out of turn. Tllc rules of parliamentary pro-
cedure came up as the case proceeded, but
there was no explanation of each ruic. Still.
i am wondering how many of the witnesses
know what ‘Point of Information‘ means.

Another instance of unfair trial was when
one of the board members started yelling at
the defendant and the witnesses in much the
same way a parent yells at a three year old
child for doing something wrong.

1 do realize that an adversary stancc
should be taken by the board members
against both the defendant and tile corn-
plainant, but the board seemed to have

.lakcn the stance that the defendant was
already guilty before the casc was finished
being heard.

As there were a lot of witncsscs, two were
asked to make closing statements. This was
understandable, since the case would have

' cxtcndcd well over two hours and thc
wilncsses' closing hialclllCllls would pit)-
bably have overlapped; hnwcvcr, Iilc twu
Who made closing statements wcr'c nut, in
my opinion, listened to by the buanl
members. i, as one of tilC'wilncsscs making
it closing statement. did not scc any of the
board members writing down any of "0’
Statement, which included Inalcl lltl llllll lllitl
not yet been brought to light.

My final complaint is that although tllL‘
charge was that the defendant vinlalcd unc
0f the rules in tile stlldcul guidciillcs. that
Sbccll'ic guidcllnc was so vuguc lltalt illc ac-
luzll violation, in regards to tile guiliclillcs.
Could not be sccu. I

1 ill“ \‘L’l'y disuppointcd to think that this
is n student-run judicial brand. The luck of
Concern and courtesy that drew silulcilt
showed the defendant, unmllcl student.
l‘N tlruvcd to me that this is not an illl'
ludicming council, but u kuugulml mull. l

 

 

also hope that my criticisms in this lettcr are
taken well by the judicial board members. i
would hate to see the verdict bc a result of
this letter against the board.

BUSing Problems

To the Editor:

1 was appalled by the editorial, “Bus
Stop Blues" especially since I have been a
member of the downtown community for
the past three and a llqu years.

Who cares if uptown pcoplc havc to wait
allalf hour to get a bus at three in the morn-
ing? it was their choice to come downtown
in the first place. Alumni quad residents, on
tile other hand. are forced to use tllcsc
buses every day. Wc'rc lucky if we get a has
every half hour during the day, never mind
at two or tllrcc a.m.i

Do you know how hard it is to get a has
far a 9:45 Class? Ol‘ how much you have to
fight to get on tilc bus once it comes? You
say it's dangerous for drunk people to fight
their way onto a bus. llow about totally
sobcr people at 8:45 am, pushing cacti other
on icy sidewalks? i'vc seen people slidc
under tltc bus, gct llil by wild pocketbooks
and backpacks, and get pukcd ill lltc cyc
with umbrellas.

You ask for new proposals In solve this
problem; first of all, you should rcull/c that

Not A Majority

To the Editor:

1 would likc to complain about the col-
umn on tile Moral Majority in lllc ASP on
Tuesday. February 24. While I ugrcc com—
pletely that the Moral Majority is a
dangerous. puritanical group of extremely
misguldcd people who presume to tell the
country about its sins, i do not agree at all
witll your attack on Christians. Christians
consist of a wide range of religions which
are very different. save one respect. Not all
Christians are trying to make Jewish kids
pray to a Christian god and there aren‘t
very many Christians who arc right out of
the Spanish Inquisition. 'l'llc Moral Majori-
ty is not a majority of Christians. I am a
Christian and i don't think there Is
anything wrong with that. i found your
gcncralimtimls highly insulting.

Our Turn Now

One of the most important attributes of the SUNY system in
the past has been its low cost, high quality education. The SUNY
Board of Trustees has lost sight of this fact. In calling for a tui-
tion hike, they are neglecting their responsibilities to the students.
The trustees are unwilling to fight for SUNY.

If they won’t act, we must find the solutions to these problems
ourselves. '

Through the combined efforts of SU, SA and SASU we now
have a chance to state our views to our elected officials in the
legislature. '

On Monday, it will be our turn to lobby in a strong and unified
way.

We must all join together to tell our legislators that we cannot
afford a tuition increase.

It is the obligation of the state to provide students access to a
quality education. We must convince our elected officials that
there are reasonable alternatives other than a tuition increase in
order to balance the SUNY budget. We are sure that there are
other areas of the state budget that can be cut which would have a
less detrimental effect on the future of the state and our nation as
a whole. .

if the necessary moncy cannot be found, the alternative would
be tragic.

With the decrease in government grants alld loans, many
students may find it difficult to cope with the present cost of
education. With an added tuition increase it could become im-
possible to deal with.

We cannot allow public higher education to be used as a pawn
in the budget game. it is a necessity and the legislature must
realize its responsibilty to provide it.

So on Monday, we must all descend on the Capitol and let our
voices be heard. We must go in numbers to make them aware of
our needs. '

Without sizcable student support, our pleas will not be heard.
And the trustees will continue to raise our tuition annually until
higher public education becomes a luxury only the rich can af-
ford.
