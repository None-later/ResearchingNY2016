Oneonta earlier In the week. Sauers
calls .iednak his best defensive big
man, and his absence will leave the
Danes lacking in tiie middle.

“There's no way he's even close
to playing on the tournament,"
Sauers said. “That makes it dir-
ficuit for us matching up inside."

So the Danes will have to rely on
their bench power more this
weekend than ever before this
season. The Albany substitutes
have outscored their opponents sc-
cond line players all year. but the
true tcstjs still to come.

The AMIA and WIRA will be
sponsoring the first Albany
superstars competition. The idea
was supplied by Long Beach State
in California, who have been runn-
ing a successful Superstars competi-
tion. The events will take place over
a six week span that will start right
after the spring break.

The contest will be run similar to
the one seen on television. There
will be two swimming events, a
50-yard and ZOO-yard swim; two
running events. a 60-yard dash and
a half-mile run. There is also a
weightlifting competition, a basket-
ball free throw contest, a softball

There will be both a men‘s and
women’s division, with prizes being
awarded to winners in individual
events as well as first. second. and
third place for the entire competi-

Albany’s best male and female
athletes. The application fee for
entering is $2. and you must fill out
an application prior to March 6.
Applications can be filled out in the
Intramural office in. the Physical
Education Building.

Mike Raschbaum. who is
organizing the event, believes that
