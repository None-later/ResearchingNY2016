“We were just tryirtg to tap it in-

i couldn‘t believe it went in
myself," Polan noted.

Cortland grabbed the lead almost
imntcdiately in overtime on Walt

Felder (13 poirtts. 10 rebounds), the
Red Dragon's 6-5 ccrttcr. commit—
ted his fifth foul. leaving tltcnt
without tltc services of their two top
starters. Stanislt then hit botlt ends
of a one and one to bring the Dancs
within one.

Cortland picked their shot
carefully against Albany's man-to-

ed. Low went in for Cesare attd
'quickly gave tltc Danes the lead
with 2:35 left with rt driving basket
inside. Cortland turned it over 40

tland within ortc. but tltc Dragons

tlten iced the victory with two free

Cortland dropped itt anotlter

“It was hard for us to play
without Felder and Meyerdicrks."
Cortland head basketball coaelt
Alan Stockholm noted.

“it was foolish." Sauers com-

mented. “for tltcrn to foul out
when they were ahead — that's
bad."

“As long as they had the lead
they had the quicker team in there
(witltout Felder and Meycrdierks)
and it could have worked in their
favor," Clune pointed out. “But as
soon as we got tltc lead it worked in
our favor.

“i think this game could be at-
tribttted to tltc crowd." Clune add-
ed about the srttall, btrt noisy ltonte
audience. “I f we were on the road it
would have been real hard for us to
win. Hopefully this will give us
