it has been a long time since an
Albany State basketball team won
20 games in the regular season. but
the Danes notched their twentictlt
in the season ﬁnale on Tuesday
against Cortland in University
Gym.

But it wasn't easy. Albany was
down three tintcs front tllc secortd
half on, but each time tltey fought
back and finally edged the Red
Dragons in overtime, 66-64.

“l ltavc llcvcr been so proud of a
team." said Albany head basketball
coach Dick Sauers. “So many gttys
were sick and lturt. Coaching was
no longer a factor. it was tlteir in-
dividual effort and pride. They’re a
bunch of winners —- the whole
damn team."

The victory extended Albany’s
record to 20-4 — the best regular
season mark they have ever posted.
The Danes hadn'l matched that
output since the 1960-6] calnpaiglt.
although they have gone on to win
over twenty games ill each of the
past two seasons in post-season
play.

The game was also special for
another reason. With Potsdam
already selected to host the NCAA
Division Ill Eusterll Regional,
seniors Rob Clttne. Ray Ccsarc.

Dick Sauers hates it. He feels that
even though a team plays a 20 game

must.still subject itself to the
hazards of a four team tournament.

“We were kind of charged up."
Cltlne said.

“it felt a little special," Cesare
added. “i realized it might be the
last one ltcrc and i got a little up for
it."

Albany. with all four seniors star-
tillg. controlled the game in the first
ltalf. leading by as nluclt as 20-l2
despite 38 percent shooting from
the lioor. The big difference ill the
half was Albany's control of the
boards, with John Dicckelman (l3
points. 13 rebounds) ripping down
six of the team's 21 rebounds wllilc
Cortland was held to only l4.

The Danes led 29-24 at halftime.
but the Red Dragons came out roar-
iltg ill the sccotld half. With l5:48,

altd dropped itt an easy breakaway

35-33. Aided by Albany‘s horren-
dotts outside shooting they extend-
ed their advantage to 44-37.

Then the momentum began to
swing back to Albany. Dicckcllnan
blocked a shot anti Cesare tlrovc ill-
side for two to ltnrrow the lead to
44-4]. Slowly the Danes closed the
gap and tied it with seven lllilttltcs
left on two Mikc Gallo free throws.
47—47.

Although the Bulls possess a
mediocre ll-l4 overall record, tltcy
are 8-2 in the SUNYAC. altd have
won seven of their last l0 games.

"They're apparently capable of
playing very well.“ Sauers said.
“Buffalo is a capable team. They're
the type oftcam that will stay in the
game with anybody because of the
way they play.

“Right now. with tile condition
of my team. l‘d rather play a team
that is deliberate."

Without their big man the Dragons

Ruling Challenges Title IX

A federal judge in Michigan has

may be a major setback for Title
lX, a federal law mandating equal
opportunity for men and women in
the athletic programs at federally

Title lX states that “no person in

the issue “may end up in ‘the
Sttpremc Court . . . and in view of
the administration (tltc result may

Athletic Association (NCAA) has

Several of the member schools of
the NCAA have argued that their
programs are self-supporting and
subsequently should not be subjch
to Title lX regulations.

SUNYA Athletic Director Bob
Fold said that nlost ofthosc schools
who opposed the rcgttlation “were
the big ntoncy schools — such as
Texas and Alabama." The athletics
of such schools are primarily self-
sufficient.

“none of ottr programs are self-

“SUNYA-liar! eight or nltrei‘ri—luilun

Janet Grahm of the lNS said the

that better records call be kept.
“Now we can monitor foreign
students better," explained
Graham. “We fotlttd that in admit-

“Say a person has problems with
