lax-Mean ie Speaks of Experiences

Ex-moonie Bonnie Kamp
describes her experience with the
Unification Church as if she wcrc
recounting a nightmare. Although
the 23-year old has been “free” for
over three years now, she seemed to

remember every last detail when she
spoke in front of a small group last
Sunday in tlic Patroon Room. The
lecture was sponsored by the
Graduate Students Association and
the Jewish Student Coalition-Hilch-
Action Corps.

“it was an cxtrcmcly down
period of my life," admitted Knmp
as she pushed her hair out of her
face. “College was not going well, i
was unhappy and i caught my best
friend in bed with my boyfricnd."

Although she was raised as a Jew.
aticndcd Hebrew School and taught
chrcw. shc startcd to think about
joining the sccurity of tiic Moonics.
“At first i was hesitant." she said.

“because of all the stereotypes we
have about the Moonics. i thought
they were all spacey drug addicts.”

But when an old friend of hers in-
vited her over for dinner to meet
some Moonie members, Kamp said
that all of her preconceived notions
sccmed wrong. “They all seemed
really nice." she explained. “They
camc across as cican‘cut kids with a

purpose. They all seemed so liap-‘

ny.

As she said this. Kamp's voice
softcncd. “But it was all part of the
mind control. it’s all just a head
gamc. But i fell for it because i was
dcspcratc: They seemed to have all
the answers."

Kump quickly added that she was
not an isolated victim. “Thcir
recruitment procedure is positively
frightening," she said matter-of-
factly. “They know exactly who to
go after — who's susccptiblc."

Kamp said tiic majority of thc
members are whitc. upper or
middle-class, idealistic. intciiigcnt.
in college and usually in tlic top to

percent of their class.

She said college students make up
the majority of the group because
they are usually idealistic and look-
ing for answers. Freshmen going in-
to college amount to a large percent
because often it's their first time
away from home and they feel a lit-
tle lost.

Coilcgc also provides a great deal
of pressure, she added. “Mid-term
and final times are common periods
when students are likely to join.
Thcy’rc worn out, fed up, tired and
full of questions."

Scnior year is also a vulnerable
time. she said. because they don't
know wlicrc ihcy’rc going or what
tlicy want to do. Tlic Moonics pro-
vide tiic sccurity ihcy'rc searching
for, she explained.

"The group makes all sorts of
promises." Kamp explained. "but
it's all a dcccption. Oncc tlicy httvc
you, the mind control tccliniqucs

arc implcnicntcd. A person can be
easily brainwashed within one
wcck."

 

Mind control techniques varyp

she said. but common ones include
food dcprivation. sleep deprivation
and chanting. “Thcy don't let you
think. You are forced to constantly
chant and pray so your mind
doesn‘t work. The mind control
techniques get stronger tiic longcr
you stay." -

In addition. she said. lhcrc is no
access to radio. television or
newspapers. “You arc coniplctciy

your ptist. You arc ctit off froin
