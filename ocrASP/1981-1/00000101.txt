Nicholas Cassimeris. co-owner of

and said there has been a 60 percept

40 percent of peanuts are “smalller

While availability has decreased.

As a result. peanut dealers are

forced to import peanuts from
Brazil, China. India and Africa.
"Yet this won’t be enough to meet‘
the American demand." Cassimeris
said. '
SUNYA students will also feel
the effects of the shortage. Peanut
butter. is now only served in
cafeterias [during lunch. according
to Commissary Director Ronald

“Peanut butter is just not
available. We have been paying 25
percent more for peanut butter

“Buck Rogers" has been rated as
the most violent program on televi-

A new group callch the
“National Coalition on Television
Violence" has rated programs
shown in prime time oii the basis of
the number of violent incidents they
contain.

"Buck Rogers" was rriiiked first.
followed in order by "The Dukes of
Ha/Jttrd.“ “The Misadventures of
Sheriff Loho.“ “Hill‘l to Hurt."
and “NBC Thursday Nigltt at the
Movies."

 

The group also studied the Sztlur-
dtty morning TV programming nim—
cd Ell kids. and named “Bugs Iiun-
ny" its the most violent kitls' show.

Violence. according to the group.
was defined as “the deliberate tlllti
hostile use of overt force by one iti-
dividtirtl against iiitolltct."

Among the other virilcnl kiddie
programs natiiicd were “Mighty
Mouse." "The Roadrunner.“ and
“Popeye.”

Dr. Jeffrey Young says many
people find it awkward to talk on
first dates because they are extreme-
ly anxious when the meet someone
new. Many others. Young adds,
don't get nervous. but they turn
other people off by talking too
much about themselves. .

In both cases. the psychologist
says, lie recommends that the pa-
tients watch the way Carson
handles his guests on The Tonighl
Show. Says Young: “1 encourage
them to view Johnny as a role
model. because he's extremely skill-
ed at making conversation with
people he's just met. He‘s a good

he confirms — through a joke or a

Just a few months ago. social
scientists were saying that the
macho image for men was out. and
that the sensitive male was in.

However, according to the
publication Advertising Age. that's
all going to change again. The trade
publication of the advertising in-
dustry says that the “macho look is
back in style."

The magazine quotes one leading
ad agency as saying that the tough-
guy dominant mtlic image is about
to re-cntegc. and that sensitive men
will be pill "on the brick burner."
