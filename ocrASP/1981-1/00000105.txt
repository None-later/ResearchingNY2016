On A Show For Full House

by Michael Carmen

The Albany synchronized swim-
ming team, after putting on a
choreographed show last Saturday
night before a full house. are off to
the New York State lnvitationals.

Led by a well choreographed
routine by Kathy Berdinka and
Debbie Puzo, the swimmers showed
their expertise. "It was a night of
fun and everyone enjoyed it im-
mensely,” stated Cygnet coach Pat
Rogers.

The Cygncts are now in prepara-
tion for the lnvitationals. to beheld
in Geneseo this weekend. It is a
five-team meet and will include
Gencseo, Hunter College and
Vassar College.

“We should win. We have been
beaten by Vassar before by one
point, but last time out we defeated
them.” commented Rogers.

The squad. which includes no
seniors, is very young and has only

one swimmer in the senior level
competition. Tammy Neill.

Unfortunately, Neill is uncertain
for the March 6-7 meet. She is cur-
rently suffering'from bursitis of the
knee and didn't perform in last
weekend's extravaganza.

"Tammy will hopefully be back
for the meet. She accounts for two
of the eight routines we will do, and
without her it will take almost a
miracle — not to put to the pressure
on her shoulders," Rogers added
cautiously.

The Danes also possess a fine
grottp of novice swimmers who
Rogers expects to do well in the
event. The novices include l’uzo,
Nancy Carroll. Amy Heveron, Pat-

‘ty Lowe. and Mary Ann Streh.

These swimmers will also figure
prominently in the competition
since they account for the remain-
ing six routines. in their last meet.

H Following the New York State
meet the Cygnets will compete in

the Eastern Regionals scheduled in-.

Albany. The schools competing in
this event include Vllianova.
University of Vermont, Wheaton
College. Millersvillc State College,
and the University of Pennsylvania.
The outstanding swimmers in the
Easterns go on to the Nationals.
Rogers says that it appears unlikely
that any Albany athletes will
qualify.

“We have improved a great deal
this-season. We were very inex-
perienced at the start and have lost
a lot of swimmers the past two
years. This year's team is a good
base for next year." evaluated
Rogers. -

Albany State is the defending
New York State and Eastern
Regional Champion. They pulled
the feat last year with only nine
competitors, which is the amount
they possess this season.

“We are working very hard and
hope to retain those titles." added
Rogers.
