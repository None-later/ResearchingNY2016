NCAA Bid Doesn’t Fare Well

. when they should be playing at home

 

 

'by Bob Bellafiore

The NCAA Eastern Regionals will be held at Potsdam next
weekend. That was decided last week. That was also a very large boo-
boo. ‘

The book says that the winner of the SUNYAC gets an automatic
bid to the Eastern Regional. Last year. Potsdam won the conference,
and only then were they granted the right to host the regional.

Now, in the NCAA's infinite wisdom and foresight. they figured
that the Bears were a Shoo-in to take the SUNYAC title again, and
hence earn the right to host the regional.

Wrong.

Albany State won the SUNYAC's, the automatic bid, and the right
to host. The NCAA probably didn’t expect that to happen. Now what
do they do?

They can't go against their own handbook. They can‘t take the
regional away from Potsdam. So they send Albany back up to
Potsdam for another possible showdown — afourtlr of the season.
and the third in five weeks.

How can tltc major governing body in intercollegiate athletics be so
needlessly presumptuous as to all bttt award a conference crown and
all the spoils that go with it to a team that hadn’t rightfully carried
them yet?

Okay. Potsdam is 26-2, and the only losses they have are by one
point each. They really do deserve to host. But those aren't the rules.
When the SUNYAC realigned before last season and the tournament
was instated to decide the championnthc team that won, it was decid-
cd, would get the bid. and the chance to have the NCAA‘s at their
court. ‘

Put simply. Albany won the tournament, and they should host.

The NCAA was quite mistaken in their assumptions. Now the Bears
will play the weaker of the four teams, and Albany will face St.
Lawrence -— the otltcr team that beat Potsdam, and he forced to fight
and scratch their way into the finals, and possibly another game with
the Bears. .

Basically. it is stupid for the Danes to have to go back to Potsdam

N atioital Crown Only Tick Away

by Larry Kahn

Andrew Seras was just one se-
cond away from becoming
Albany's ﬁrst Division lll National

Wrestling Champion on Saturday ~

night at John Carroll University in
Cleveland. but he had to settle for
runner-up as he paced the Albany
State wrestling team to an excellent
ISth place finish and became the
Danes' first freshman All-
American.

Seras. the only underclassman to
make it to thc ﬁnals. met Chad
Gross from John Carroll University
in the [34 pound championship. The
two wrestled to a 5-5 tie in regula-
tion and Seras icd 3-2 in overtime
when with one second left Gross,
wrestliitg before a large and noisy
hometown crowd, scored two
points on a reversal to steal the
crown.

Still. Seras advanced farther than
any Albany wrestler ever has with
his second place showing. On the
season overall the 134-poundcr had
a phenomenal 45-5-1 record and
had the second winningest year itt
Albany wrestling history.

“The job Andrew did was
outstanding," said Albany head
wrestling coach Joe DcMco.
“Throughout it all he kept his cool,
and you can't come any closer than
a reversal in the last second.

“i was really just so pleased and
proud of him. He certainly exceed-
ed everyone’s expectations and
goals -— or at least equalled them."
DcMco continued. “He‘s the best
freshman l‘vcr ever coached — no
question about that."

“l’m happy. It would have been
nice to Will. but l'm happy," said a
very satisfied Seras, who was voted
one of ﬁve wild card bids to the
Division l National Championships
in Princeton in two weeks for his ef—
forts.

To get into the final Seras had to
defeat the top seed. Pat Holmes.
and “he kicked the living hell right
out ofhim" according to DcMco as
he crushed him l3-4.

As a team Albany bcttcrcd last
year‘s performance by 14 positions
and finished fourth among
SUNYAC schools. Ninety~thrcc of
tile I47 Division lll schools were

represented at the tournament.

“it was unbelievably fantastic,"
said DcMco. “The guys really
wrestled well — nobody got really
blown out of the water."

Four other wrestlers had
qualiﬁed for the Danes, but only
one, Spiro Theofilatos. came close
to becoming All-American.
Theofilatos won two matcltes. but

“it was an outstanding showing

J .V. Danes Blasted By ABC;

 

Two Losses Characterize
Up And Down Year

by Marc Haspcl

The season is finally over for the
Albany Statc J.V. Danes.
Characteristically, it was one of
highs and lows. And the jayvees'
final two games reflected the ex-
tremes that typified the season.

Both contests resttltcd in losses
with Albany hitting the lows Satur-
day, against thc Albany Business
College Owls, 105-98, and reaching
the highs Thursday night against
Colgate, just barely losing to the

 

 

First year coach Rick Skecl took the .l.

Division! school 61430.

Witltoui the services of Billy
Everett and Wilson Thomas, .WllO
were in Potsdam with the varsity,
the Danes took on ABC in what
amounted to bc a very offensive
battle. However. Albany fell behind
early and could never recover.

Paced by the cotubincd (til point
effort of the backcourt tandem of
Willie Jones and Mike McBride, the
Owls jttmpcd to a 54-39 halftime
lcad. ‘

Jones checked in 35 points while
the six-foot McBride had a truly
outstanding evening with it re-
bounds. ll assists and 33 poiltts.

"Mcl‘iritlc is a good ballpluycr.
He did at one-handcd reverse slam
dttnk that left our players‘ eyes wide
open," said Albany State junior
vttrsity basketball head coach Rick
Skch

Again typically, the Danes tried
to uutnugc a comeback in the sc-
cond half and got within four
points. But that was as close as they
were to get, eventually dropping to
the seven point deficit.

High scorers for the Danes in-
clttdcd substitute point guard Mark
Ford with is points and Craig
Kinns chipping in with 16 points.

Thursday. the Danes faccd Col-
gate on the road. Against the Divi-
sion I school. Albany attained its
final high of the season. Aceordirtg
to Skeel, Colgate was “talented,
disciplined and well coached. They
had the best outside shooters of
anyone we've faced."

But the Danes executed so well~
on offense as well as on defense that
with a minute and a half left,
Albany led by six points, 58-52.

After a Dane timeout. thejayvees
went into a stall as theyjust wanted
to run out the clock. But Cari
Askew took a had shot that allowed

,Colgatc to take possession and go

down for two points.
On the inbounds play. the Danes

' tried a fast break but Askew was -

called for a charge, sending a Col-
gate shooter to the line for one-and-
one as Albany was over the limit.
His first attempt did not drop. and
on the rebound, Colgate successful-
ly convened for two more points,
cutting Albany's lead to two.

But that slim lead was short>livcd
as on Albany's next possession,
Thomas drove baseline and was
called for charging. This time. lltc

Colgate shooter at the line hit the '

first foul shot but failed on the
bonus shot. However, once again

one point.

The two losses dropped the
Danes' scason record to 8—i3. littt
as Skccl noted at one point this
season, Albany was 2-6, going 6-7
after that.

“These kids could have laid
down and died. but they kept gct-
ting better," said Skccl. “We learn-
ed to play offense and learned how

to play tlcl'cnsc. That's what J.V. ts

ding to Skccl.

Another high point had to be
Albany's sltcilackiug of Rl’l after
the [Engineers had beaten the Danes
carlicr iii the season.

"They continued to work ltard in
practice, took criticism and didn't
quit," Skccl concluded.
