Police InVestigate Child Murder

by Wayne Peereboom

Troy police are still following
leads in the sexual molestation and
killing ofa six-year-old girl. while in
Albany police are responding to a
number of reports of attempted
child abduction.

Albany Police Lt. John Damino
said the Troy killing may have led
to the numerous reports in Albany,
somc of which have been faund to
be false.

The nude body of the murdered
child in Troy, Charlene M.
O'Brien, was found Monday,
March 9 in a clutnp of bruslt ap-
proximately ten blocks front her
home. The girl had disappeared the
day before on her way hotnc frotn a
cousin's house. Police are trot sure
of the exact time of the killing.

Last Wednesday, Troy police
released a description of tire
suspected killcr as a white male
under 30 years old, approximately 5
feet 9 inches trill. 120 pounds, with
medium length brown hair. Aps
proximately 20 full and part-time
Troy investigators have been assign-
ed to the case.

On March ll, an ll~ycar-old
Albany girl reported that she fought
off art attacket who tried to Ittre her
ittto his car. The attacker, she
claimed, tore her clothing and
broke her glasses. The would»be ab-
ductor fled, she reported. after she
screamed and stabbed him with a
pert.

The following day, a nine-year-

old reported that she ﬂed from an
assailant who tried to grab her.
Daminno said, “We're not
treating them (the two cases) as if
they’re false. but we have some
cause to believe they may not have
happened the way they were
reported." He said police are still
investigating the cases.

Other reports, Damino said, have
been found to be false. A report by
two children that a child had been
abducted outside of an Albany
elementary scltool was found to be
a fabrication.

Most recently, Damino said, an
Arbor Hill ‘yOlllll reported an at-
tempted abduction on March ill.

The report, Dantan said, was

found to be false. .
Dumino noted that child abduc-

tion reports in Albany were rare‘-

5 before the Troy killing. “1 tiﬁnk it

might be more than a coincidence
that the poor little girl was
murdered and all of a sudden we get
all these reports," he stated.

The rash of reports, Damino
said, is probably a combination of
children's attempts to get attention.
and the ample press coverage the
reports have gotten. "i think the
press has created its own little
monster," he commented, referring
to two or three reports that were —
printed before they were found to
be false.

Fast Will Raise Funds

to Stop World Hunger

by Barbara Schindler

“Approxirttately 460 million peo-
ple will go to sleep hungry tonight"
according to Chairperson for Peo-
ple arid Food (the hunger awareness
group on campus) Maureen Mitr-
pity.

l’cople arid I’ood will be holding
their fifth annttal 30-hour fast for
the hungry l‘riday, March 27th in
the litdiatt Quad perttltoitse and
Saturday, March 28 iii tltc (‘rtmprts
(‘crttei Assembly Hall.

“There is a duel purpose to the
fast“ explained Program ('oor-
ditiator Kathy Griffin. “The first is

to raise awareness to the problem of
hunger, and the second is to raise
funds." in the past four years Peo-
ple and Food has raised over
$21.0(X) from the fast, said Griffin.
These funds will be pill to use in
third world countries for self
developtttcnt projects such as irriga-
tiott systems, nutritional edttcation
programs and for the itttprovcntent
of farming techniques arid equip-
merit.“

(irift'itt added that tr portion of
the money raised will also be
distributed to several homes for
dcslilulc people in the Albany area.
