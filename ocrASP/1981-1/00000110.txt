Race Lists Sold for. Use in College'Recmitmént'?

PRINCETON. NJ. (CPS) The
College Entrance Examination
Board has providcd at least it col-
leges with rcqucstcd lists of only
black or only white high ‘school
students. which the collcgcs thcn us-
cd in thcir own rccruiting programs
during tltc l‘)79-80 academic ycar.
.lttu Harycy. ltcad ot' tltc Studcnt
Search Survcy. thc (‘ollcgc Board's
Priuccton subsidiary that actually
sold tltc lists. says tltc compulcr
match-ups ol' collcgcs and tlIc kinds
of studcnts tltcy want is "lookctl on
as it scrt'icc. not disctimination."
Shc adds that rcqucsts for lists of
stttdcnts of (tilt: raw or tlllOlllCl‘ are
not uncommon. “Usually ." shc
says. "it‘s ttccuusc tltcy oft‘cr
spccial minority scholarships or cur-
ticulttm. and tlIcy want to rcach tltc
rigltl murkct.“
llarvcy could ol‘t'cr Ito cxplana-
tion of why a collcgc might want a
list of cxclusiycly-Cattcttsian
studcnls. but cmpltasizcd the (‘ol—
lcgc Board docs not ask for reasons.
Tltc lists of sludcnts arc compich
from pcoplc who take any of tho
(‘ollcgc liourd's many cxams — tltc
Scholastic Aptitudc Tcst and other
cnlrancc L’Nllllls for gruduatc,
mcdical attd la“ schools. Sludcnt

characteristics are gleaned: from the
Student Descriptive Questidnnairc
filled out when the student registers
for one of the tests. according to
Julia Galuska of tltc Collcgc
Board’s Education Tcsting Scryicc
(ETS).

Galuska stresses that registrants
can clroosc to simply ignore thc
qucstionnairc.’or just answcr somc
of its qucstions.

Tltc qucstionnairc asks studcnts
to identify thcit high scltool gradc
points, ltow much moncy lllL‘)‘ c\-

their collcgc costs. what thcy intcnd

Thu Collcgc Board. through its
Studcnt Scarclt Survey subsidiary,
tltcu sclls the information in list

stitutions and govcrnmcnt-
spousorcd scholarship programs for

cltargcs tltc lists cnublc collcgcs to
“ovcrlook minority stttdcnts and
conccnttatc on whitcs only."

llttrycy disugrccs. saying lhc
systcm works "\‘ct'y mttclt to tltc

students“ advantage" because it
helps them learn of available pro-
grams and scholarships.

Thc lists, moreover, have drawn
charges that thc College Board
engages in a different typc 'of
discrimination altogether.

The privately-owned American
Student List Company sued the
College Board in 1975 because of its
refusal to make to lists universally

available to anyone willing to pay .

tltc pricc.

“Oh. it's been going on forever."

Harvey. says. “but the College

Board decides the policy, and .

they're very p‘articulnr'about the
confidentiality of these lists, and
that students know who these list
are going to. They're not planning
to change that by selling lists to
commercial groups."

Complex Forms Hurt the Elderly

by Nora Kirby

Thc compch wording of ccrtain
govcrntncnt documcnls may bc
prct'cnting cldct'ly pcoplc from
rccciying scrt'iccs tltcy dcscrvc. ac—
cording to a study rcccntly coin-
plctcd by SUNYA Reading Dcpart-
Incttt professors Scan A. Walmslcy
and Richard I.. Allittgton.

Walmslcy cyplttincd that approx-
imalcly 9t) voluutccrs ahoyc thc agc
ol~ ()0 wctc given a standardi/cd
Icatliug tcst to dctcrminc thcit'
rcttdiug ability.

“()I' thc samplc wc tcstctl."
\\'ulmslcy said."65 pcrccnt rcad
at lcss than an eighth gradc lc\'L‘l.
wltctcas 98 pcrccnt of documents
for goycrnmcnt scrviccs wctc
hcyond Illt.‘ uittllt gradc lcycl.”

'l‘ltc objcctiycs' of tltc study wcrc

to idcntit'y thc rcading demands
madc ou thc aged in thc arcas of
hcaltlt and community rcsourccs.
and to asscss tltc ct'l'ccts ot' simplify-
ing tltcsc rcading dcmattds through
modification ot‘ rcuding materials.

llowcycr. ut'tcr rcvising ccrtain
documcnts and tcsting a ttcw sam-
plc of cldcrly pcoplc the results wcrc
somewhat Inconclusivc. said
Walmslcy.

“Thc ptoblcm is' much more
complicalcd than wc originally
thought." said Walmslcy.
“Simplifying Iltc forms isn‘t the
unswct. 'l'ltc rcttding problcms ol'
tlIc cldcrly harc much motc to do
\\lll\ non-Ictuling problcttts."

Walmslcy cxplaincd that some
cldcrly pcoplc lltl\’t.‘ a “mcntal sct"
or rigid frame of rcfcrcncc that may

interfere in their acceptance of new
idcas.

Even though the study. which

was funded by a grant from the Na.
tional lnstitutc on Aging. did not
provc conclusive. Walmslcy still
bclicrcs simplification of govern-
ment forms will be of SOmc hclp.
, Walmslcy said the answer may bc
a facc to face intcrvicw hctwcctt a
rcprcscntativc of tltc govcrt’tmcnt
agcncy and tltc applicant with tltc
obtained information proccsscd by
comptttcr.

As a result of this study.
Walmslcy said. “Wc'yc also
dcvclopcd an inlcrcst in the ltinds ol'
problctns Incntbcrs‘ of tltc Unhctsi-
ty ltavc. such as filling otIt Iltc
ncccssary forms for financial aid."
