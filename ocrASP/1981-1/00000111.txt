Senator Attacks Marijuana Use

conﬁrmed from from page
(D-Manhaltnn) argues Iliat the law
would “give marijuana a mystique
that mach ii attractive to
youngsters."

Goilfricd also feels the bill would
make law enforcement in the suite

~ “look like ii jokc" because police

would be busy chasing down of-
fenders. bringing them to court and
then simply letting them go.

“li‘s as ifsomcoiic sat up think-
ing of how to make the law look
ridiculous." he said.

Golll‘ried. who led the state‘s
dccrirninalizruion cl'l'oris four years

“Thch is no real evidence that
because of the dccriminalizalion
law. there has been a substantial
rise in marijuana use." said Gott-
fried.

"Other states which still use the
old law have also had increases in
drug uscl'as well."

While Padavan maintains that
smoking marijuana may pose
serious health hamrds for users.
Gottfried feels that this should nor
be a criteria for making it illegal.

"Marijuana may be harmful to
your health lllll‘il doesn't mean you
make it illcgal. You don't have
policc chasing down cigarette
smokers, alcoholics or excessive
.sugui' caters, iillhough these
substances have been found to be
detrimental to your lrcalih.“ said
(loll i'vi'cd.

“You don’t solve 2i health pro- '
hlcm through ihc law. You should
focus alienlion on education and
counseling programs to combat
marijuana use," Gottfried said.

The hill to rccriminalizc mari-
juana was first inlroduccd in the
Assembly in 1977 by Assemblyman
Vincent Nicolos (D-Quccns), but it
was rejected in both houses of the
state legislature.

Gottfried. the assistant majority
'lcndcr of the Assembly, tech» the

same is likely to happen to the bill
this your. -

Kostns, however. believes that
the future of the marijuana
recriminalization bill is nor dead.

“It took us three years to pass the
anti-drug paraphernalia law, but we
finally got it through. This bill is the
same kind of thing." said Kostas.

However, even if the bill passes
and the possession of marijuana is
considered a misdemeanor in cer-
tain quantities New York (State’s
laws will still be comparalchly le-
nicni to the nation as a whole.

"ACOD is weak in that it just
treats possession as a misdemeanor.
It's still pretty lcnicnt, said Kostas.

Senate - Seats

continued from front page
Nominations and Elections, which
included two student represen-
tatives, presented a resolution in-
structing the faculty senators to
meet separately at least once a
semester to discuss problems of
primary concern to faculty. They
also recommended the two amend-
ments. The resolution was passed,
but lack of a quorum blocked
passage of the amendments. A mail
ballot was called for. requiring a
minimum of 470 ballots for up-
proval. 436 ballots were returned in
favor of the first amendment. 86'
opposed. and 4 abstained,

Birr expressed relief that the
faculty reached a decision regarding
the amendments. “There was an in-
ability to get a clear—cut decision on
these matters," he said. “to get a
quorum or sufficient return on the
mail ballots." He jokingly added
that the faculty may have voted out
of desperation. saying. “now we'll
be able to talk about something
else."
