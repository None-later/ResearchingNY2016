it didn't seem possible seven years ago,
but it has come to pass that Reagan is the
president, As soon as he ascended into this;
ofﬁce, he cvaporatcd the hopes of his critics‘
by calling for massive budget cuts and ac-
celerating Carter's aid to the government of
. El Salvador. While his supporters compete
in budget-slashing, those to be affected by
his actions wait in limbo.

in this space tltrcc weeks ago, Bob Cohen
investigated the, effects of the proposed
budget cuts. While 1 applaud his effort, tltc
opponents of these cutbacks should view a
large welfare system as more of ti necessary
evil than a permanent phenomenon, for it
exists only to strengthen the economic
system by ameliorating the unequal
distribution of wealth and income. in this
column i am concerned with what the
Reagan actions tell us about the character
of American politics, and thus what may be
in store for the next few years.

in an effort to predict the post-World
War it relationship between the military
and the civilian institutions, political scien-
tist Harold Lasswcll coined the term
“garrison state." in this picture, every
aspect of civilian lifc would be subjugatcd
to thc needs of the military; there would be
a permanent war mobilization. To be sttrc,
he was only describing ottc possible civil-
mililary sccnntio, but he did live to see the
creation of this country‘s ﬁrst significant
pcnccful army. Considering the following
four points, it appears that military con-
siderations are strongly figuring in the
Reagan administratrion’s calculations.

get guns to‘go along with Milton Fried-
man's advice. And Reagan was so
transparent in discussing his South Africa
policy in an interview with Walter Cronkite
that even the press (for example, Carl
Rowan) noted that blatant racism was being
condoned for strategic consideration.
Domestic Surveillance. in an advisory
report, the Heritage Foundation recom-
mended increased surveillance of political
opponents, including anti-nuclear and anti-
draft advocates. This message was taken to
heart, for a CIA proposal for “a changing
world" (or, a world where military nccds
come first) “removes the requirement that
lntclligcncc groups must have 'probablc
cause to bclicvc’ that a US. person or cor-
poration is ‘an agent of a foreign powcr‘
before break-ins, physical surveillance, or
infiltration could be used to obtain infor-
mation frotn tltcm (AP. March ii). in a
military-conscious world, (the govcrnmcnt
must sccurc "unity" behind its positions,
so opponents stand in tltc way. i suppose
we'll see an Un-Amcrican Activities Com-
mtttcc ttcxt.
in these moves, the president may claim
that lie has received a "mandate" for
change. However, if policy were determin-
cd by the public opinion poll, Reagan
would ltavc to change his views on abortion
and thc ERA. More importantly, how can
any mandate be seen from an election with
such a low voter turnout? it is clear that
morc pcoplc titan cvcr arc alicnatctl frotn
politics as usual. Furthermore, thc prcsi-
dcttt is an elected official and not the

 

 

Tilt: Budget. At the same titnc that thc
budget-cutters launch an attack on "sacred
cow" wclfarc programs. military spending
will be dramatically increased OVCI‘ tltc ncxt
three years. It HcClilS' ‘ i‘ his money is to be
spent for no other reason than to have a
large military budget: itt all scrlotlsncss can
we look at an absurdity such as the MX
missile system without laughing? Strangcly
enough, the same pcoplc who claim that
government spending is lltc cause of infla-
lion are those who support this t‘attcd calf
the most; this certainly indicates that the
military is to occupy a special role. If
Reagan is really against big government's
inflationary spending. then why would he
support this?

I‘ll Salvador. llavcn't \vc bccn ltctc
before? Reagan has sent “llLlVlSlli'S” anti
lalkcd of a naval blockade to support the
ruling junta against t'cbcls with a claim to
popular support. At least Reagan, llaig,
and even tho pt'css arc ltoncst; they ltavc atl-
miltcd that there is absolutely nollting to
gain in El Sulvdor cxccpt an increase itt US
“prcstigc” and "influence." Once again,
we feel tltc’caltl wintl of a draft; it may be
necessary to sacrifice a few lives to support
this arrogance. interestingly enough, world
opinion (but sitlcd with the U.S. actions on
Afghanistan is very critical of'tltcsc moves,
again a throwback to the Vietnam days.

Human Rights. licsitlcs placing rm
outspoken critic of human rights policies as

Rights. Rcugnn has made it clear that
military needs will come first. Mililury «id

sovereign oowcr ot' the state. Dcspitc
misconceptions to the contrary, the prcsi-
dcnt docs not have the power to
singlcltandcdly rulc the nation. Oncc again
though, military questions most often pro-
vokc a rcsponsc that no public debate is
needed, and the quest for “leadership” has
fooled many people into thinking of the
president as the solitary political actor.

Military cxcgcncics have strongly in-
filtrated the political arena, as seen itt these
four areas. 1 submit that this is an increas-
ingly present danger to lltc individual
autonomy of public and privatc institu-
tions. lil this spacc last year, i noted that
tltc American Olympic atltlctcs were used as
political pawns, and as we move into what
appears to he a permanent policy of (lcfcnsc
priority, it is certain that the government
will move into new areas ofdominntlon and
create ncw victims. This policy will fuel the
arms race. bring tltc chance for instant
destruction closer, and threaten human
rights in the United States and in thc coun‘
tries of the world that serve as political
pawns for the military conflicts of the
superpowers.

At lcast it appears that a response is
developing, especially itt foreign countries
that view the U.S. as a threat to world
peace. Reagan‘s victory has made it rcspcc-
table to be a conservative, and tltcrc arc
ominous signs of racism. But these misfor-
tuttcs are likely to develop a response. a
countcrtnovcmcnt; this sequence of events

What’s the best adjective you can think of to describe a $150
tuttton increase? 

Hcyl That's pretty good.

We’ve been coming up with similar ones ourselves. We’ve also
been trying to think of ways to fight the increase.

l.Ilknd tltc best idea we can think of is to support this Tuesday’s
ra y.

We must now consolidate a thousand mcagcr voices into one
strong, powerful roar of opinion.

As a solid block of outraged students, we must peacefully des-
ccnd‘ upon the State Capitol and let our legislators sec and hear
that the students of SUNY will not condone the scheduled tuition
tncrcasc, cannot afford the increase and will not allow the board
of trustccs to pass on costs to us year after year.

And If our prc-rally publicity has been effective, then our
lcgtslators will be forced to watch this rally very closely as they
pcck out of the windows of their plush offices. ,

We all must be there for tltcm to see us. For if apathy reigns
and the turnout is poor, then our elected officials will turn back
to their desks and continue their bureaucratic process of paper
shuffling. The work and sweat of our student leaders will be
wasted, and tuition will continue to skyrocket.

But if several thousand of us come to the rally, then our
lcgtslators will be forced to stop, look and hear us, and we will be
heard.

We need cvct‘yonc’s support.

Evcn ifyou are financially well-off and this increase won’t hurt
you, then come and fight for your fellow students who can’t af—
lord it. Fight to preserve tltc dying philosophy of low-cost public
higher education.

We also urge all professors to excuse students from their classes
in order to attend the rally.

We, the students arc the only ones left to protest and prevent
this tuition incrcasc. , '

What is the only thing We can say about a tuition increase?
