Potsdam Takes

Welsh said about his nooi general
in reference to his poor perfor-
mance in the conference champion-
ships. “We want Eddie to take
charge. What he’s been doing is
taking over."

But Potsdam has the kind of
depth where other players will pick
up the slack when one is not playing
well. in this case. it was Rowland
and junior forward Maurice
Woods. With Albany not at full

strength at _the forward positions,'

Woods and Rowland were able to
compensate for the Bears' unusual
ineptitude from the outside by
muscling their way underneath for
baskets. Rowland scored six of
Potsdam’s l3 overtime points,
while Woods netted 16 for the game
on a blazing 8-9 shooting. grabbed
nine rebounds, and was named
tournament MVP.

Albany led, l7-l0. with 10:48 to
go in the first half when Potsdam
scored seven in a row on Rowland's
three-point play, and lay ups by Bill
Perkmvski and Jachim to tie it up.
The Danes got the lead back to ﬁve.

but the Bears went on a 8-2 spree to
take a 28-27 edge into the locker
room.

The Danes scored the first four
points of the second half on Cesare
jumpers from opposite corners, but
Potsdam’s depth kept pulling them
back. -

“What we hoped to do was play
tough man-to-man with a lot of
substitutes," Welsh said, wanting
to slow down and tire the depleted
Danes.

Albany still led by seven; 39-32,
on Dieckelman‘s three-point play.
But Potsdam got a quick 62 scor-
ing edge, and worked back slowly
the rest of the way.

“There were no miracles."
Sauers said. “it's just a game that
should not have gone into over»
time."

The way Albany got to their so.

though. Trailing by as much as 10
points in the first half. the Danes
found themselves facing extinction

cond half only once — at the end.
