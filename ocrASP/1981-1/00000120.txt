With whipping winds making the
30 degree temperatures feel even
colder it's hardly ideal weather for
tennis. Yet the Albany State men’s
varsity tennis team began their sprv
tng season last week. sweeping two
regular season and two exhibition
matches on a five day Florida tour.

"We set this as a goal for
ourselves this fall," said Albany
men’s tennis coach Bob Lewis. “I
think this kind of experience, work-
ing together toward a common goal
and traveling together, brings us
closer together as a team. l was ex-
tremely satisfied — it was a good
experience for all of us."

Lewis pointed out that the trip
was not funded by the Athletic
Department. “None of this was
budgeted. We earned it on our own
selling donuts and showing
movies,“ he said.

The team began their road tour
on March 8 in Orlando where they
trounced Kenyon College, 7-2, in an
exhibition match. The squad also
managed to squeeze in a half day at

Disneyworld. They then journeyed
to Belmont Abbey for their second
exhibition stop and triumped, 6-3.

The Danes opened their regular
season the next day against Stetson
University crushing them, 8-1.
Barry Levine (7-4 in the fall), Fred
Gaber (8-3), Rob Karen (lO-l),
Dave Ulrich (5-3) and Andy Dia-
mond (4-5) captured the top ﬁve
singles matches for Albany. Dave
Lcrncr (7-3) suffered the only set-
back in the sixth slot. in the doubles
competition Levine and Gabcr,
Karen and Ulrich, and Diamond
and Dave Feincrman all teamed up
to sweep in straight sets.

The ﬁnal stop on Albany's
journey was Melbourne, where they
rotnpcd over the Florida institute of
Teclmology, 8-l. Levine lost at
number oneI 7-6, 6-3. but
everybody else won — some not as
easily as others.

Gabcr pulled out a victory over
FlT's Gaspar Dcsionego after drop-
ping the first sct. 6-7, 6-3, 6-2.
Later, in doubles, Gabcr got
together with Levine to sneak by the

Two Gymnasts Compete In Regionals

by Marc Haspel

The Eastern Association of inter-
collegiate Athletics for Women
(EAlAW) Division lll Easr
Regional Gymnastic Champion-
ships took place on the sixth and
seventh of March. Although as a
team Albany State did not qualify,
three individuals — Barbara Shaw,
Alicia Steinbcrg and Elaine Glynn
earned the right to compete in the
annual event held at Connecticut
College in New London, Connec-
ticut.

Unfortunately, Glynn was suffer-
ing from a "chronic back injury
that had flared up," according to
Albany State gymnastics coach Pat
Duval-Spillanc and was not able to
attend the meet.

That left only Show and
Steinbcrg to represent the Danes in
the regional. Shaw, a senior from
Kingston, competed in the uneven
bars event. while Stcinberg, a
freshman from OCcan Side, per-
formed in the uneven bars, the

balance beam and the floor excr-

cisc.

in order to qualify for the
regional meet, the qualifying scores
had to be achieved four times dur-
ing the season. Also, no more titan
two of these four scores could have
been taken from home meets.

in the uneven bars competition,
Shaw received a score of 6.4, while
Stclnbcrg marked a 6.3.

Steinbcrg, who was ranked
twenty-first in the east coast prior
to the meet, went onto post a 6.4 in
the balance beam and a 7.5 in the
ﬂoor exercise.

Overall,
pleased with those individual
results. “They pretty much hit their
averages," she commented.

Albany, which was ranked 30th

nationally in Division III, four-

teenth in the east and second in the
state, failed to qualify for the meet.
The team that won the meet and a
ticket to thc nationals this weekend
at thc University of Wisconsin was

Haynie-Zadan pairing ‘in a pro-set
match, 8-7. " "' "

V The team is coming off a fan-
tastic fall campaign which saw them
streak to a 5-1 ﬁnish capped off by
their second consecutive SUNYAC
championship and their fourth in
seven years under Lewis' direction.
in fact, in the to years Lewis has
been Albany tennis coach, the
Danes have compiled a 97-32
record.

But this season the Danes will be
facing a very tough schedule in-
cluding matches with Division l
powers Colgate and West Point.

"There are at least seven or eight
tennis teams on our spring schedule
which are capable of beating us,"
noted Lewis. "We will haVc to play
at our best if we expect to win any
of these matches."

The going may get tough for the
young netmen. but Lewis has plenty
of strength and balance of his own
to counter with. Co-captains Levine
and Gaher lead the attack for the
Danes at numbers one and two,
respectively. Levine, who went to
the Division III Nationals last year
as a freshman, has a career record
of 25-l0 and Gabcr, also a
sophomore, is iii-4.

“Levine and Gabcr are both
playing very well rigln now. They're
playing as well as i expected them to
be playing at this point," Lewis
commented. ‘

in the number three slot, Karen,

a freshman, returns after a
phenomenal debut that included
winning the SUNYAC champion-
ships at third singles last fall.
Ulrich, Diamond, and Lerner
round out the squad and have all
shown improvement, according to
Lewis.

The nclmcn next take on an ex-
cellent Concordia team, on April 4
at home. The entire spring season
should be a challenge for them, but
the long run effect shoud be
beneficial.

“Our record probably won't be
as good this spring because of the
calibre of the competition," Lewis
noted, “but we want to play good
tcants because it's good for the
team and it helps our tournament
play."

Final Four Familiar Road For Bears

by Paul Scllwurtl

The road is a familiar one for
l’olsdum‘s‘ basketball team. Two
ycttrs ago the ltcars were the sur-_
prise team in Division lll, knocking
off highly-ranked Stony ltruok and
using lillll impetus to reach the final
four. in the finals of that tourna-
mcnt, Potsdam came within one
jump shot of upsetting three-time
champion North Park, and the
iicars settled for the runner-up spot
in the nation. it was a position the
items could accept.

"We felt fortunate to be in the
final four two years ago," said
Potsdam head basketball coach
Jerry Welsh,

Wcil, Potsdam is back among the
elite of Division ill this year as well,
inn this time, the llcurs go to Rock
island, Illinois (the final four site)
not as upstarts, but as an experienc-
cd team ready to capture the only ll-
tlc which has eluded them — the
NCAA Division lll cluunpionship.

The trip became a reality after
Potsdam defeated Clark, 87-81. in
the semifinal round last Saturday.
ltcforc an overflow crowd, one that

was “hard to believe. even bigger
that the one for Albany in the East
chional," according to Welsh, thc
llcars delighted thcir homc fans by
taking a tltrcc point halftime lead
and then racing to an lit-point lead
in the second half. Thc final score
would not have been as close ~— the
licnrs held a l4-point lcad with two
minutes remaining —- inn Potsdam
missed the front end of one-and-
onc l'rcc'throws nine out of ten
timcs in the final four minutes. But
despite the poor foul shooting cx-
hibition, Potsdam was impressive
against Clark, a Division lll New
England power.

“We played exceptionally well —
about as well as we can play," said
Welsh. “We probably played twice
as wcll as we did in our last game
with Albany."

That was a 68-63 Potsdam vic-
tory over the Danes in the East
Regional Championship game, a
contest which was sealed when
guard Ed Jachim hit two free
throws with nine seconds left in
overtime and Potsdam clinging to a
64-63 lead. Juchitn, a consummate

floor leader and point guard,
sprained an ankle late in the Clark
baligame, and as of Wednesday he
was not practicing with the team. if
Jachirn is unable to play in this
weekend‘s final four, Welsh in-
dicated he would use either .lcri
Mirnbito or freshman Marty
Groginski in the vacated guard role.
Both players have played sparingly
this season, and neither will be able
to fully rcplncc .lnchim. a two-time
State University of New York
Athletic Conference most valuable
player and a Division ill all-
American.

Lcd by .lachim, leading scorer
and rcbounder Derrick Rowland,
and forward Maurice Woods, the
Bears have put together their fittest
season ever, posting a 29-2 record,
including three victories in four
tries over Albany. in the first round
of the final four. Potsdam will face
24-5 Ursinus, a squad Welsh knows
little about. “They like _to run. they
have a 6-7 center, and they‘re good
shooters. That's all i know about
them,” Welsh said.

if Potsdam gets by Ursinus, the
winner of the Augustann-Ottcrbcin
game will be next. This year's final
four is unique in that Augustann is
the host school for the tournament
every year, and by qualifying for
the tourney, Augustuna assures
itself of a strong home court advan-
tage. “if there are 4000 fans there,
3999 of them will be rooting for
Augustana," Welsh said. “They
have to be the favorite."

if not the host learn, then certain-
l‘y Potsdam must be considered the
favorite. The Bears were 24-6 last
season, but a surprising loss to
Longwood in the semifinals
eliminated them. Both of
Potsdaln's setbacks this year were
by one point (to St. Lawrence and
Albany). and they have been ranked
as high as third in the national Divi-
sion lll poll. .laehim and Rowland
are both seniors, and their careers
will end this weekend. They expect
it to end with a victory celebration.

"When you get this close —
down to just four teams -- you
naturally want to do it all," Welsh
said.
