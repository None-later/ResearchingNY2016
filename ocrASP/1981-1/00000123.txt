' ‘Middle Earth Exarnines Y oun'g‘Adults ’Saicides

by Sharon Cole
“11' we don't straighten this out.
\ Lori, I swear I'm going to kill us
both."

Those words went unheeded. but
Lori Gochie. age 20. a tall. slender
blondc from the small Adirondack
village of Schroon Lake. had cause
to remember tltern wltile lying in a
hospital bed almost three weeks
later.

Jack Sltufelt. Goeltie‘s estranged
boyfriend. apparently depressed
tltat a reconciliation betweert them
wasn't forthcoming. went through
with his threats at approximately
3 a.m. on February 8.

Sltufell waited outside a local
bar. tltc Black Bear iii Pottersviilc.
until Gochie. his live-iii girlfriend of
two years. appeared and then shot

.and wounded her with ltis 20-gattgc

shotgun. As streams of people ran
from out of the bar and gatltered
around (iocltic, Sltiti'cit jumped lil
his trtrck arid drove to his home iii
Schroon Lake. There lie wrote an
apologetic note to ltis parents. He
rcntoved a picture of his sister.
Lisa. from the living rooin wall and
placed it in a bedroom. His brother.
Kenny. rushed to Slrut'clt's home
after hearing about the shooting.
As he was walking tip rlte driveway.
Jack Sltttt'elt sltot himseli' iii the
itead. He died ubotit 15 minutes
later iii his brother's artns.

The suicide and attctnptcd
murder sent shock waves through

 

this small village of 1200 residents.
The question repeated over and
over by the townspeople was simply
“Why?”

There are no easy explanations
for suicide. only sober facts. Bet-
ween 1955 and 1975 the national
suicide rate tripled. from 4 suicides
per 100,000. to 11.8 suicides. Even
ntore startling. the suicide rate
among young people between the
ages of 20 and 24 is higher than arty
other age group. at about 15
suicides per 100.000.

Mary McMahon. coordinator of
Undergraduate Counselors at Mid-
dle Earth. SUNYA's eouttseling

ltotlinc service. says that one of the‘

highest risk groups at this age are
college students.

"College caritptises have a very
risky population.“ McMahon said.
“It is a crucial age with a lot of
upheaval. Those outside don‘t see
the pressures on college students.
Imagine spending four years work-
iitg towards ntedical or law school
and then not getting in. It's got to
be devastating."

However. recent studies suggest
that early estimates of student
suicides were too high. perhaps by
as muclt as a ltalf. because of ir-
regular reporting standards. Early
studics had placed the student
suicide rate at between 15-20
suicides per 100.000. This is less
than half the rate for 20-24 year
olds iii the general population dur-

ing the same period (1970-1976).
These studies suggest that the
pressures of young people ofttside
the college environment, such as
entering the work force and beginn—
ing a family. are very heavy. and
that perhaps a college campus is a

ntrich more stable atmosphere than
once thought.

Jack Shufclt. age 21.never con-
sidered going to college. He drop-

* ped out of school at the age of 16,

having progressed as far as the
eighth grade. Sltut‘elt. one of sevctt
children. who was tall and thin with
curly browrt shoulder-length hair
attd large brown eyes. worked for
the past six years with his brothers
and father lit the family logging
business.

Cherie McKenzie. a long-time
friend of Sliui'eit‘s. said, "Jack
never wanted a lot of life. He just
wanted to own his own home. to be

   

«4 c- mum sea-:4 : Lari; r : :.Ur.'¢1.:.a.;;;.1; n; I“,

guess he really wanted Lori."
Anne LaBarge. another long-
time friend of Shufclt’s agreed.
“Jack was very sensitive. things af-
fected him deeply," she added. “I
think he had a lot of responsibility
on him and he just couldn‘t handle

it. He had just bought a house iit
November and was worried about
that. arid then Lori left him itt
December. You can't blame Lori
for what happened - she had to do
what was right for her. Jack was
just a very weak person."

“There are a myriad of very corti-
plcx reasons for why young people
decide to take their lives — pro-

ﬂy as many reasons as there are
suicides." said Vicky Lindsay.
graduate student and (iroup atid
Outreach Coordinator at Middle
Earth.

"it could be u very simple event

with parents. or a break up," she
continued. “Anything can be the
last straw for these young people.
They have usually had a long string
of prior negative events and are ﬁll-
ed with feelings of depression and
lack of hope for the future."

it was this feeling of hopelessness
which many Schroon Lakers agree
led to Jack Shufelt's death. As
Mike McKee. a friend of the Shufelt
family for niany years. said, “It's
inconceivable to me that he intend-
ed to shoot Lori. I think he meant
to scare her into coming back to
him. and then when he realized that
he did hit her. he was overcome by
the gt:ilt.“l think he thought she
was dead."

All of this is speculation. of
course. Nobody really knows why
Jack Shufcit decided to pick up that
shotgun.

"People who commit suicide."
said Lindsay. "feel that no ottc can
help them. that their problems are
ittsolvable. and that there is no
hope for the future. It‘s sad that
these people have no one to turn to;
that they don‘t trust anyone to help
them.“

Several of Jack’s friends realize
now that he was extremely depress-
ed. btrt no one realized ltow serious
it was until now. Lori Gochie said.
“I guess I should have listened to
Jack wltcn he threatened me, bill I

.jitst never tltottgltl that he would
carry through. His actions just went
so against his character — he wasn't
a violettt person at all."

As Cherie McKenzie said. “it
