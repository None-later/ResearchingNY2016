punk eye ,

You've heard of pink eye? Well,
a doctor in The New England Jour-
nal of Medicine is now warning
about what he calls “punk eye."

Punk eye. according to Doctor
Thomas Caspari, is caused by ex-
cessive “pogoing.” or dattcing to
punk rock by jumping up and down
rapidly.

not be the case. he says.

Why wouldn't aliens make their
presence known? “The’ simplest
solution,” says Papaglannis,
“might be that of confusion and in-
decision. Thcy might be debating
whether to crush us or help us.”

Fortunately. Doctor Caspari
says. punk eye is not too painful.
and can be cured by abstaining
from pogoing while the eyes heal.

flak to feminist

A book which instructs women
on how to induce their own abor-
tions is causing a controversy
among feminist activists.

The work was written by Suzann
Gage of the Los Angeles Feminist

However. other fetnittist leaders
argue that virtually all of the
methods are potentially very
dangerous to the woman herself.
Some women's groups have gone so
far as to compare some of the
techniques mentioned as being as
dangerous as “selling coat
hangers."

reportedly ltas been selling well in
countries where abortions are il-
legal. and' most recently in New
Zealand where once-liberal abor-
tion laws have been toughened.

According to Professor Michael
Papagiannis: “If there are any ex-
traterrestrial colonies, tltcn the
asteroid belt (between Mars and
Jupiter) seems to be the ntost logical
place to look for them.

i’apagiannis says that aliens liv-
ing iii the asteroid belt would have
access to all natural resources by
mining the asteroids. and they
would also have ample solar energy

The pillsI which are currently be-
