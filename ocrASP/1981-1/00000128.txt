Just Some Thoughts... ‘ ,
by Bob Bellaflore

Oh well. another Great Dane basketball season ls over, and now my

Tuesday and Saturday nights are free. But to tell you the truth, I’d

rather spend them sitting in some gym somewhere watching the Danes

take Dick Sauers‘ motion offense and aggressive man-to-man defense :
and put them into full living color. Over a long and quite successful

season. there are a lot of things that stick in your mind:

0The Broekport Tournament. Everybody was wondering if a slow

and deliberate Albany team was going to be able to stop the quick,

high powered Upsala machine that went to the national ﬁnals the year
before. After squeaking past RIT, the Danes did it, and looked good.

0The first Potsdam game. It wasn‘t exactly pretty basketball, and
the Danes didn‘t win, but three overtimes will cure insomnia in
anybody. Besides. it was a preview of things to come.

'Beating Oneonta in Oneonta. For the first time in to years, Sauers
and his contingent left the place smiling. After all. why shouldn't they
be? The win was convincing, and let us know that this was no ordinary
learn. ,

'Southern Connecticut. You probably hated it. It was l7-ll at the
hall”. The Owls played really slowly. and Albany countered by doing
the same. [don't care. Even though it gets boring. I think the “Danes
delay" is great. ~

'Bcating Binghainton in overtime. Assistant Coach Bill Austin drcwr
tip this desperation play. planned to take under three seconds. That's
how much time Albany had left, and when Pete Stanish found John
Dicckclman underneath, the Danes smacked away another upstart.

'Hamillon. Who said the Danes had no guards? Even the forwards
werc guards. Both Rob Clune and Ray Cesare foulcd out. so Mike
(iann and Stanish. botlt natural forwards. were in the backcourt for
the overtime. They combined on two steals. and the Danes took
another tight one back home.

'Ultlult. It was almost a shocker because for a little while it was very
much in doubt. and when Stanish missed his next-to-the-last second
jumper, the game looked over. llut Cesare grabbed the carom. took a
step, and let fly. Final scorc: Albany 66, Union 64.

"The SUNYAC‘s. No Joe ,lcdnak. Oh God. Derrick Rowland‘s
gonna go wild. Wrong again. upset breath. Steve Low contained the
all-American center. and the Danes pulled it out in overtime.

GThc NCAA‘s. Back to Potsdam . . . again. .Iednak was still out,
but this time he wasn‘t the only injured Dane. Stanish had a bad neck
and a worse ankle. He wasn‘t anywhere near full capacity. Despite
this. Albany jumped to an tl—Z lead. First they had it, then they
didn't. then they did. then it was tied and nobody had it. Uh oh. more
overtime with Potsdam. Five minutes later. it was more like “Oh no,
they did it again." Another long trip back. but for some reason this

one wasn‘t that batI,'hccatIsc we knew how much we had done.-.

I guess there were the players too. (‘csnre was hobbled all year by a
had :Inklc, but hc was still the Inuit in the clutch, the quiet leader on the
cotnl with the jump shot that. when it was on. was deadly. Clunc did
everything on both ctttls of the court. The I'looI general of Sauers‘ mo-
tion ol‘l'ensc. he was anything but quiet. Ills dcl'cnsc was disruptive —
just ask lid .lachim. He knows all about It. A ltXXI-point scorer, Clinic
played in 106 straight games and never missed a practice in four years.
Losing (‘cs'arc and him is like the end ol~ an era.

I)icckclinttn was another one. He was the sophomore that didn't
play like one. lie was the one that everybody talked about. And he is
the one that has still got two years left.

But Slanislt is not. llis “ginning—quick dt'ivcs‘ could spark the Danes
and I'illllt.‘ defenses. His bombs from the corners left zones shaking
lhciI heads. The emotional leader of the Danes. he‘ll be tough to
replace.

"It‘s going to be hard (to Icplace the lcant)," Saucrs said. “We're

 

going to lose a lot ol’ experience."
