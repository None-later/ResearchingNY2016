mances by tracksters Scott James
and Bruce Shapiro, coach, Bob
Munsey’s “Clutch Kids” raced to a
ﬁfth place ﬁnish in the New York
State Collegiate Track and Field,
Championships.
James started 31‘ f the duo’s runn-
ing when he burned away the field
‘ in the 3000 meter run. His time of.
836.0 was not only Albany State
and fieldhouse record, but also a
New York State collegiate mark.

“Scott ran-just a stiperb race. He
started in fourth position then mov-
ed up slowly and on the last lap he
just sprinted away from the field to
build up a 25 yard lead and bring
home the gold," stated Munsey.

In the very next race Shaprio kept
up the Danes' momentum. Shapiro.

He stayed with the rest of the run-
ners for the ﬁrst laps of the race,
but on the last lap he just took off
to take a seven yard lead. For the
remaining 60 meters of the bell lap
he was able to ﬁght off his com-
petitors and hit the tape first.
“Shapiro ran a very smart race.
He ran the last straight-away in the
middle of-the ﬁrst two lanes making
it extremely hard for anyone to pass

him inside and out — and no one:-

did," exclaimed Munsey.

The two were not the entire story

“Dector and Harvard ran very
well in the hurdles. but another one
of our runners, Brian Ragule, just
missed making the ﬁnals by inches
when he drew a very taugh field in
his opening heat," added Munsey.

Throughout the day Albany State
indoor records drooped and the 500
meter run ’was no exception. Tony
Ferretti, while crossing the line in
fifth place. etched his name in the
books with a time of l:07.5, break-
ing his own record.

' Newton, who ran in the relay also
raced in the 400 meter dash. “it was

Munsey said.

Well. Newton didn't let down
anybody and broke the Dane record
in the 400 meter event by one se-

Don Kennedy, WhO' was also
eliminated in the hurdle event, came
back in the pole vault and placed
fourth, vaulting 13 feet.

This meet concluded the indoor
season for the Danes. The squad
completed the dual meet season at
10-3, for a .777 winning percentage.

“I’ve been calling them the
Clutch Kids all season," added
Munsey, “and last Saturday they
were super. Next year we should be
even better."

Under Munsey's experienced
direction. the track team is hoping
to continue its current success as it

. prepares to make its annual warm
weather transition to the outdoors.

CHARLOTI‘ESVILLE, Va. (AP)
— Virginia's elation over winning a
spot in the NCAA basketball tour-
nament’s Final Four gave way
Monday to concern over Saturday‘s
jji2p8no game with arch'rival
North Carolina.

Twice during the regular season,
the Cavaliers stormed from behind
— first from 13 points in arrears,
then from l6 '— to whip the Tar
Heels. 63-57 at home and 80-79 in
overtimme at Chapel Hill, NC.

On the ﬁrst occasion, Tar Heel
coach Dean Smith used a collapsing
zone defense to pile up a big lead.
in the second game. North
Carolina's utilized a pressing
defense to move even further ahead
before losing.

Each time Virginia, with 74
Ralph Sampson, Jeff Lamp and
Lee Raker cast in starring roles,
solved North Carolina's famed
delay game after intermission and
came out the winner.

To participate at the junior skill
level athletes must have mastered 12

irequ‘ired stunts and two optional

ago.

Junior Tammy Neill, the only
senior seed for Albany achieved

“Rocky,” took fourth place.
Sophomore Patti Lowe joined her
peers for the finale. “Our team
talent ranged from novices earlier in
the season to junior and senior skill
level. Our novices had to learn the
more difﬁcult moves and the new
, routines in just ten days in order to
' qualify for the ability standards."
said Rogers. “They did a super job
considering the time they had," she
added.

Assistant coach Sylvia Ulion, an
Albany alumni and former Cygnet.
worked with the novices throughout
the year to expand their skill ac-
curacy and to prepare them for
junior competition.
