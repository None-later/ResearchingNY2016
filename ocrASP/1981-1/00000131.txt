Not everything went according to
plan. Three players decided in pre-
season that they did not want to
play basketball this year — one
potential starter and two other
substitutes that no doubt would
have seen much playing time. So

any good,_Saucrs would have to rise
all of his 26 years of basketball
know-how. and everybody would
be forced to make adjustments.

Rob Clttne. one of two four-year
varsity players on the leartt. would
be the point guard rather than an
off guard —— ltis more natural prisi-
tion. Ray Cesare. the other four-
year mart. would play more at
guard lhart he did the year before.
when he was basically a forward.
Pele Slanish would have to learn
control because lie was now a
starter instead of a sixth man. And
everybody had to get used to play-
ing more. Last year. only one player
played over 30 minutes per game.
This season. four of the five starters

 

Strategically. Saucrs had to
deviate front his much preferred
style ofa pressuring defense. arid a
run-whcn-you-can offense. He
didn't have the depth nor the speed
to play his game, so he changed it.
Albany would slow the tempo down
all the time in favor of a ntore con-
trolled and calculated pace. preserv-
ing his players' stamina so they
could get their maximum for not
only the 40 (and sometimes more)
mintrtes of a hallgamc. bttl for the

“We never lutd a year with so
many problems with irr-

' had an injury. someone came in and

pickctl up the slack. They always

found a way." ,

One way was by experience.
Seven games this season were decid-
ed by two points or less. aritl the
Danes won six of them. Sauers at-
tributed it to the veterans. “There
really was a lot of experience out
there," he said. “and that helped us
in the close games.”

That was the most noticeable
asncet of the Danes. When the go-

There was Cesare hitting u re-
bouttd jump shot to bcltt Union.
There was sophomore center .loltn

There were other disadvantages
the Danes had to face. rtarrtcly a
schedule that provided only 10
home dates (out of 28 games). and
one slrclclt of five games irt rtirtc
days. “This is probably the best

And in the pre-scason. they all went

Success of Rally Examined

What was tltc result of 'l'ucsday's rally at tltc Capitol? it depends on who
yotr talk to.

According to Assembly Higher Education Committee Chair. Mark
Sicgel. “It's impossible to say what's going to happen now."

“l‘rn not sure if we can stop tltc tuition hike." said Sicgcl. "A lot of it
depends on what happens irt Washington. Cuts irt aid corrld run so deep as
to thwart arty effort to keep ltritiort as it is."

Sicgcl claimed the best way for students to fight the ltike is to write
their legislators. "l.tl\\'tlltll{t‘l’s rrrtrst he made to see this as a crucial issue.
Their awareness must be increased.“

Ranking rttirtnrity member of tltc Assembly Higher Education Commit-
tee .Iohrr l-‘lanuagun was slightly rrtorc optimistic.

"The state is receiving extra rrtottcy this year irt income and sales taxes.
All that is needed to make a tttitiort hike unnecessary is $18 million. i am
planning to submit a hill to restore the $18 million. and 1 think we're very
close to gcttitrg lltc needed votes to pass it."

'Accordirtg to a legislative staff member. "The legislature is sympathetic.
it will allocate more money for SUNY. But lltere is no way it can stop the
SUNY Board of Trustees frorn rrrisirrg ltrilion. The rally should have been
aimed at tile governor and the board. not at llte legislature."

A spokesperson for SASU said it was “too early“ to tell wltetltcr
students would be successful itt stopping tltc hike.

“It all hinges on whether or riot we can mount an effective lobbying ef-
fort." she said. ' -
