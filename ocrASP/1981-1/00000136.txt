In 'I'Iie Land CHI: ;

1 Past the antiquated warehouses that bore
the faded yellow legend."Chew Mall Pouch
Tobacco." past the lanky old Junk dealer
with the salt-and»pepper. billy-goat beard.
carting his goods to market in a noisy.
squeaky. horse-draWn carriage. past the
portly and pompous ward boss who would
once again. with gutteral vehemence. snort
behind the oakwood podium: "I cannot and
will not endorse this sort of activity In our
community." Leo appeared at the forbidding
entrance of Madame Bagnlo's to deliver the
stuffed white envelope Into her old and
withered hands. He was red-faced and out
of breath as he knocked on the door.
Madame Bagnio appeared almost instantly
and snatched the envelope from Leo‘s
hands. She opened It up, and withdrew the
contents. ejaculating:

"There's not enough here!" She then pro-
duced an Ivory-while Victorian cameo from
her breast pocket and held It before Leo's
face.

"No. Madame Bagnio. please." he plead-
ed. “I thought the lull amount was there. I
was sure of It. Do show me some mercy."

"Come In and close that door.” demand-
ed the madame. "l deplore you." Leo did as
he was told. He had been Inside the
Madame's home many times before. but this
time it looked different. Leo wondered why.
upon entering. he was not immediately con‘
sumed by nausea as usual.

n . . .

You see. Leo was allergic to good taste. It
was true. Yet. now the Madame’s lace cur-
tains didn't phase him. he was not repelled
by the plush. green velvet sofa. and the
grandfather clock. an heirloom Imported
from Zurich. did not offend him.

“Now tell me. Insubordinate one."
Madame began. "What do you mean by
coming here and short changing me?"

"I don't understand. Madame Bagnio. l -"

"Not another word. dog." she cut him
short. Her original question had been
somewhat rhetorical. She knew why there
was not enough money. anyway. That in-
flated lrlsh scum of a ward boss was taking a
cut. He was getting to her people before Leo
was. Hypocrisy only slightly bothered
Madame Bagnio. but If she was to foot the
bill she became moral about It.

"How can that long winded pariah have
the gall to face the people with a clear cons-
cience after this?" Madame Wondered aloud.
hissing the words out of her llght-Iipped
mouth and dilating hereyes. Leo sat enrap-
lured by her. At times such as these.
Madame appeared ageless and beautiful.
Leo could not endure It. All his life he had
struggled admirably to maintain a seamy.
riff—raff disposition. He loathed anyone who
transcended his low standards.

"Have you been to Manfred's?" Madame
queried with authority.

“Yes. of course. He's the some."

Madame looked down and folded her old
and withered hands together. Fdr the first
time. she looked vulnerable — like a school
girl. The tick of the grandfather clock was
more noticeable in the silence. After almost a
full minute. Madame looked up. Her face
had recovered Its former tenacity.

"I know what we‘ll do. Leo." she began.
That was the first time she had ever address-
ed him by his given name. "Let's go dlre'ctly
to that shanty Irish bastard and confront him.
We'll tell him straight out that we're willing to
risk arrest and imprisonment by exposing
him publicly. But if he‘s smart. he'll let us
keep our territory and to sell him on It. we’ll
Just tell him he can raise the trolley fares a
nickel. Simple as that. Plain. ordinary extor-
tion. He'll understand." Madame Bagnio
smiled. In a month she would be dead. A
stroke. She stood up.

"Now. go. Tell Manfred. tell everyone.
Don't fail me. insipid one." Her voice carried
a slight threat with It. Leo dreaded what
Madame might do should he somehow fall
short. One time she forced him to dine on
pheasant with Chateau-Briand. Leo was not
the same for weeks.

Outside a slight drizzle had begun. Leo
walked with his head down. He usually suf-
fered no bouts with his conscience. but as he
looked around. he felt guilty for taking
money from these poor. innocent wretches.
They were like him. They didn't ask much.

As he passed the university, Leo regarded
the students with unbridled contempt.
Nothing makes any difference to them.
They're Just a bunch of coddled, ungrateful
parasites. They sit around and talk all day
about who knows what. Tight-listed socialists
with trust funds and atheists who secretly
believe In God. living In fear of being
discovered. ’

Leo's concentration was diverted by the
sound of a collision. A four-car pile-up was
attracting aslegion of onlookers. One of the
rubbernecks was felled by a heart attack. As
If following a sequence of film plates, two of
the cars in the pile-up ignited Into ﬂames.
Leo felt the soles of his feet burning. The rain
was powerless against the fire and grey /
smoke emanated from the wreckage.

"They'll find out." he Intoned. Just above a
whisper. “They'll have to answer to the
Almighty. someday. Maybe some of 'em will
discover before it's too late that the only way
to cleanse yourself —— the only way to God’s
grace is to suffer. suffer. suffer. That's all."
Feeling farely complacent with himself. Leo
continued to walk. '

Leo" turned his gaze down toward the
pavement again and transferred the din of
weeping and police car sirens to the rear of
his attention. He smiled only slightly. 0

“Just Because You’re Paranoid...”

We're talking about one of those mornings
when you wake up convinced that Kafka
wrote “The Metamorphosis" with you In
mind. The sort of day when lay-offs are an-
nounced at work and your co-workers smile
sadly at you. pat you on the back and treat
you like you're terminally ill. The sort of
night when your girlfriend's mother died Just
to give her an excuse to stand you up.

Paranoid is not just for holidays.

I refuse to believe that I alone suffer from
this heightened awareness. (I also refuse to
buy the cheap propaganda that It's a disease.
A curse perhaps. like most forms of genius.
but an illness. never.) Ican't be alone. Unless

I o -

the squirrels are right. and it Is a conspiracy.

I know that my many friends have been
sending me mail. Letters and letters pour in
from all over the northeast every day. But
the mallman's been stealing them.

It's like being psychic. Being paranoid
means knowing what scum the people
around you really are. You can ride any bus.
look in their heady little eyes and tell what
they're thinking.

They're Jealous. all of them. Every petty
weasel on that damn bus. They could tell
that l was different. oh yes. I mean. you'd
notice a pearl lyingln a dung heap. wouldn't
you? Well. the vermin that live In the dung

-

can too. and they hate pearls. And
diamonds. And rubies and sapphires and
emeralds. They hate all precious gems.

There's a saying that's become pretty com-
mon. "Just because you're paranoid doesn‘t
meaqthey're not out to get you."

I'm not alone. There are other paranoids
out there. People like me. who walk above
the crowd. and the crowd hates all of us.
'Especially me. 'cause I'm the besi~looking.
but they hate all of us. And we have to do
something. We have to before they get all of
us. Especially me.

They think they're fooling me by printing
this. They think that If they print this I'll think

they‘re my friends. but I know better. it's Just
a clever trick to catch me off my guard. They
think I'll get relaxed and confident and then
they'll get me.

They won't though. I'll be watching them
every second. They'll never catch me with
my guard down. Not even in the bathroom.
where I can see where they've cleaned off
the grafittl about me Just before I get there.
They can't put one over on me.

You can't either. you sneaky bunch of
rats. I know what you have In mind. But
you'll never catch me. I have my eye on all
fourteen thousand of you. Don't ask how.
When you're paranoid you can do anything.

Another Saturday night In Albany. The
day passes as most Saturday's do. No real
crises. Just a seemineg slow passage of time.
Instant reason to play once Saturday night
arrives. People are'searching If not looking
for ways to fill the space between the
seconds that pass by.

We all Inhabit this earth and sometimes we
reach through the barriers that we erect.
Gods of the masses beware. We still are
human. We are not objects. What I speak of
here Is not some dream. I speak of the hope
of the human nation.

Slow motior. holograms are still among
the choices. we prefer. Or so we would like
others. ourselves and God to believe. Music
pushes the weakest away causing the animal
to disappear. Silent dance parties move the
crowd along with effortless case. We move
the room thru Its various positions. Each 1:
special condition of life. A point in the

' straight line that cannot be drawn.

The faces one least expects to see are
those most welcome to our eyes and hearts.
That unexpected break that takes us out of
the running. Impossible to really imagine a
more perfect ending to a new beginning.

TIIUISIW was III as if the moon was lull. yet
It was run. Bob and I commented on this to
each other as we passed by the church. We

exchanged thoughts about various subjects.
never really taking any of the topics too
seriously. Stu lay on the other end of our
search this evening. Finding Stu we began
with a talk on the Heads (talking varibty). At
this point. the night became morning and all
the old dreams began to dry upon the legs of
fathers-never-meant-to-be.

Glass boundaries to spaces filled with the
hate, the heat. perhaps even the love of one
another. The tension caused by . your
presence tonight Invades my groin. Volts of
pain dance around the head of the life giving
organ.

Your dreams of male conquest ended at
the tip of my tongue. The crabs overtook us
both.‘ Soon great charges of false desire
spray their essences upon the "silkscreen."
Wanton creatures crawl over the picnic
tables of our fantasies. Endless guilt crowds
our moments of repose.

Standing atop a roof looking out over the
city of Albany. the workmen of yesteryear
revealed the sorrow of the useless tasks
assigned to them. Why build houses of sand
at all? I'm not about to pay the rent for them.
are yo ? For forty years one man has ruled
this town and yet no one seems the better for
it. Oh. the rich have gotten richer. I suppose.
The poor have moved to quiet places
beyond our daily sight. but what of that vast

middle class? Where are the fruits of their
labor? Are they hidden In the graveyard that
soon will be blacktopped to provide room for
yet another parking lot? I see their young

every night trapped in bars wearing suits and
ties. They give you the eye when you walk in
as though you're some creature less than
worthy of human respect. They're not to
lﬂame for this state of affairs. They have no
power. Their lives are controlled by ageless
ideas that died long ago. Ideas that no one
believes In. yet still they cling to them.
Open windows Invite cold gusts of hurt,
sorrow. despair and suffering to enter our
hearts. Soft voices kiss our ears ' t'vith
messages from long ago and far away. Devils
appear at our doorsteps demanding tribute
for gods that have no power over us. This in-

Eentents...

cites us to feel the shadows we live in.'0p-

purtunlty knocks us down with its forceful

presence. asking only to be followed. We are

capable of knowing and living the truth' of
- these lies.

We are forced to accept the suffering of
others as the price of their friendship. No
longer caring to be alone we tie ourselves to
blocks of hell so we can burn away our souls.
We dump our hope Into the sea of hate.
Wishing only to be free of the painfulness of
love. Our minds ache with the message that
peace has finall come. '
