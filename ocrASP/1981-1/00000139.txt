i been looking down to adjust my radio; or
if someone were in the opposite lane when l
swerved to avoid you. And what about
those of us who try to “beat the system" by
doing 50 mph on Perimeter Road; and the
guy returning from a long hard day at the
Rat.

if you must jog on the road, which by the
way, is bad for your feet and legs, at least
hop onto the curb when you see headlights
coming toward you. You see them long
before the driver sees you. Besides protec-
ting yoursclf, you may sparc many drivers
the shock of a near miss. _

Basia Background

To the Editor:

This happens to bc a reply, and i will tell
you why. it is hard for me am lo comment
on some of the information presented in the
series of articles “Rilslilillan Vibrations:
Rools, Rock, chgnc." These articles wcrc
printed in the Friday, February 20, l9ill
issue of the ASP. The historical
background information on chgac, and
Raslafarianism showed that a lot of
research wcnt inlo that project. There were
a few points that should bc slraiglllcucd
Olll.

The "dreadlocks" or “natty dreads"
referred to comes about by leaving lhc hair
to grow naturally. A lot of Rastas wash
their hair everyday, and they do not braid it
or scl it ill mud. Mosl Rustin kccp their hair
covered as much as possible bccausc it helps
to kccp lhc dusl and dirt from lhc surroun-
dings oul of their clcun hair.

The Ruslut‘urillns associate lilhiopiu with
Africa not out of ignorance but bccausc of
their profound knmvlcdgc of history,

 

 

sociology, and religion. A ll'llt.‘ Russia will

astound you with his knmvlcdgc of lhc lil-
blc. [-Ivcn classical wrilcrs cunsidcrcd lllc
general area snulh of Egypt as Ethiopia.
Egypt is also an African civilizalion. Thc
divisions nuw ill cxistcncc in Africa \vcrc
imposed upon her by Illc l'iul'opclln colonile
powcrs.
The word “dub” has no violcnt implica-
tions, and is not cqulvulcnl l0 lllc word
“luck.” “Dubbing” is onc of thc
numcmuh ways in which you can dance lo

Freedom to Chase

To the Editor:

As many people know, on Marcll 24,
many SUNY students participated in an
anti-tuition rally. Myself, along with several
thousand other students, chose not to par»
ticipatc in this rally. l, instead chose to nt-
tcnd class. While in class, in LC 1, some 50
proponents of the rally entered the class. in-
terrupting the professor's lecture, and mar-
ched around the room chanting and waving
banners. I consider this a serious infringe-
ment of my rights as a student. i made a
conscious choice not to attend the rally and
i am seriously appalled al the incon-
sideralcncss of the rallicrs in disrupting my
class as well as several hundred other
studcnts' classes. i am not against the rally
but i do casiigatc those individuals who arc
so inconsiderate as to not take other
peoples' feelings or wanls inlo considera-
tion. l invite any mcmbcr of the lhoughllcss
group who interrupted the classes being
held in the lecture centers to dcfcnd lilcir in-
considerate actions. i hope that nonc of you
are so blinded by your own cunlmiilllcnis
that you fail in sec bow thoughllcss you

Noise Pollution

To the Editor:

What was that noise? Monday afternoon
1 was walking up to Dutch Tower and was
assaulted by a tremendous wailing sound. it
contained toncs bul by no stretch of the im-
agination could it have been callcd music. i
found later that thc wailing came from lllc
carillon — have they found a ncw way to
annoy us with that lhing? The noise laslcd
for well over three minutes and i listened to
the whole thing. i can‘t get it out of my

To EverySea’I‘son'

While walking around the campus, the 'change of season is ap-
parent. The winter-long hibernation of students is over, and the
podium is beginning to show signs of life.

Spring is suppOScd to be a time of joy and rebirth; yet for every
smiling face there is one with a look of dejection. With every
change of season there is a shift in moods and emotions. The pro-
blems and anxieties left behind, have resurfaced for many of us.

The inability to be in touch with ourselves, leaves us feeling
somewhat shallow and empty. And to make matters worse, we
believe we are the only ones feeling this way. We have no one to
turn to so instead we turn inward.

When standing in a crowded room we feel all alone. And the
only solution to our problems is going to Our rooms and sulking.

The answer to our emotional depression seems light years
away, almost out of our grasp. Yet, as always, the cure is within
arm’s reach. For it is you, and you alone, who possess the power
to relieve this isolation.

Spring is the time to renew old friendships, start new relation-
ships and to expand your horizons. No, the solution to depression
is not always easy. And on a campus of 15,000 you may feel like
just another face in the crowd. But wherever you are,.therc are
many loving and caring people who need you to reach out to them
as much as you need tllcm to reach out to you. Knowing you have
each other is not the answer, but it is a start.

At this time in our lives when we are still young, strong and
cncrgclic, wc nccd to give love and tell pcoplc we care about
them.

it would bc unfortunate if in college, the time of our greatest
potential, we closcd ourselves off and wcrc shcllcrcd away from
the things that make life great.
