Syracuse: ‘ A Fight Town Again? V“'°iif“t.:"i‘iii‘:l'i‘:it5jI. 

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) Past
champions like “Slapsie Maxie"
Rosenbloom. Battling Levinsky,
Jake LaMottayand Kid Gavilan all
fought in Syracuse back in the days
when this city was a major stop for
fighters on their way up or down in
the ranks of professional boxing.

Big-time boxing returns to the old
fight town Saturday night when
Sugar Ray Leonard defends his
World Boxing Council welterweight
title against Larry Bonds in tile new
$27 million Carrier Dome.

The Leonard-Bonds clash will be
the first world championship bout
fought in Syracuse since Billy
Backus. a local boxer, fought for
nothing as he took the welterweight

years ago.
The boxing tradition runs deep in

I Syracuse. Back in the 1890's, Tom-

my Ryan, a world middleweight
champion, fought many times in
Syracuse. The next half century saw
some of the biggest names of their
day fight in Syracuse; boxers like
Dick Tiger. Willie Pep. and Jack
Sharkcy.

Robert DeNiro. the actor who

[plays LaMotta in the current movie

“Raging Bull" comes from
Syracuse. as does Pat Nippi, coach
of the I976 US. Olympic boxing
team that included Leonard.
Syracuse's popularity as a fight
town peaked back in the days when
fights were 'on black and white

“This was the hottest ﬁght town
in the country for better-than 10
years," recalls Norman Rothchild.
who promoted more than 60 na-
tionally televised ﬁghts out of
Syracuse between 1952and 1961.

Syracuse ranked behind only
New York City and Chicago for
televised fights of that era. accor-
ding to Rothehild.

The rising popularity of Syracuse
University‘s football and basketball
teams, a lack of exciting local
fighters and changes in boxing have
dampened enthusiasm for the sweet
sciettce(here in recent decades.

“Syracuse is a good ﬁght town.
but they gotta build up somebody
from here." said Johnny Tovern. a

out of Sy:acuse was Carmen
Basilio, who held the world
welterweight and middleweight
titles in the 1950’s.

A decade before Basilio started
his professional boxing career,
Henry Pylokowski came out of
Syracuse gyms with the adopted
ring name "Eddie Babe Risko" to
win the middleweight title by
beating Tony Fisher in Newark,
N..l., back in l936.

Later. Syracuse fight fans follow-
ed the career of Joey DcJohn, who
challenged for the middleweight ti-
tle. but never quite made it. He was
knocked out in front of the
hometown fans by LaMotta in
1949. a month before LaMotta won
his title.

ﬁghter, hllick Barone. lost his
heavyweight title challenge to Ez-
zard Charles. ’ - ,

Then came Basilio, .the onion
farmer from nearby Canastota‘
whose gutsy, bloody performances
in the ring earned him a place in
boxing’s hall of fame. ‘

Basilio brought three world’
championship ﬁghts to Syracuse, '
losing to Kid Gavilan in 1953, then
winning the welterweight title by
knockingout Tony DeMarco in
i955.‘ln 1956, Basilio won back the
middleweight title from Johnny
Saxton.

Basilio later beat Sugar Ray
Robinson for the middleWeight ti-
tle.

Basilio was a battling ﬁghter who
cut easily. His face still bears the
marks of his 78 ﬁghts and the man

“I got a feeling it's going to open

said Basilio.

Basilio began his career in the old
