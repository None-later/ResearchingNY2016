Pinball AreaMOVe “Not Viable”

by Bruce J. Lieber

A report compiled by University
Auxiliary Service (UAS) states that
plans to move the UAS-controlled
pinball machines from their present
Campus Center location to an alter-
native site arc "not viable."

SUNYA President
O'Lcary proposed removing the
wall separating the pinball room
from the inain floor lounge area
January 13th. in order to “cretrlc
additional lounge and study space
for students iil tiic Campus
Center." A modified version of tire
UAS report will be sent to O’Lcary
this week.

The report states that “any

Vincent‘

movement of the pinball machines
would entail costs signiﬁcantly
higher than any possible benefits."
it acknowledges the need for
greater campus lounge and recrea-
tional space. but cites that “moving
the pinball room would not create
additional space, rather, it would
trade one type of necessary space
for another."

The report outlines four alter-

native sites that UAS considered. I

Moving the machines to thc~

bowling area was proposed, but the

Tllc tttllctldtllcnt would provide

estimated total cost of $80,000, The
number of students in bowling
classes would also be restricted, the
report stated.

Two other sites considered ine
volvcd extending the floor area in
the Patroon Room and the Fireside
Lounge, respectively, in order to
create space for the machines.
“Unfortunately, the cost of
$100,000 for such an operation is
considered to be prohibitivc,” the
report stated. ‘

According to UAS President
Dave Poiogc. any such costs could
ultimately be financed through iii-
crcascd board rules.

Tllc first alternative outlitrcd by
tltc UAS report involves moving lllL'
piiihall facilities out of the Campus
Center and into the quads. The
report forrild, however, that this
would “so directly limit the ability
of off-campus students to usc tltc

machines that it couhl not be coil-'
