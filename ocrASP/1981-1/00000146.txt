Murray Hoekman sat hunched
over in an old wooden chair next to
the candle-lit table. His aging eyes
strained to relid the print on the day
old newspaper; He stared at the
headline which read, “Reagan Pro-
poses Cuts in Social Security.” He
turned to me and in a broken voice
he whined, “i'm scared, who is go-
in to hei me?"

    

 

  

Hockman, 83, is a retired gar-
ment worker. His one-bedroom
apartment on Grand Street on the

 News Future. '

East Side of Manhattan is subsidiz-
ed by a government program. The

‘ remaining 579 of rent comes out of ,

his 5289 a month social security
check. of the remaining SZlO, he
must pay telephone. electric. and
food bills.

“1 have great difficulty managing
now," he said. "Last month my
electric bill was $38, so this month i
use candles. I'll do whatever i have
to in order to remain independent."

Like Hockman, millions of elder-
ly Americans who are on ﬁxed in-
comes rely on their social security
checks to survive. Many are scared
that President Ronald Reagan may

reduce their monthly checksp mak-
lng it impossible for them to live ni-
dependentiy. in an attempt to
balance the federal budget Presi-
dent Reagan proposed substantial
cuts in social security benefits.

Harold Jarvis, 87, lives alone in a
one-bedroom apartment on
Houston Street in Manhattan. Jar-
vis is not lucky enough to have his
apartment subsidized, so he .must
do without some of the luxuries in
life.

"i ltave been very sick for over a
week," he said. “but I cannot af-
ford to go to the doctor. it is a no-

Agents with‘the Detroit office of
the F.B.i. plotted to ttse a chemical
substance that smelled like pig feces
in an attentpt to discredit a leftist
publishing form itt Detroit a decade
ago.

A recently released F.B.l. memo,
dated October l3th of 1970. reveals
that the Detroit :F.B.l. office
wanted to disrtipt the publishing ac-
tivities of Detroit‘s “Radical
Education Project."

 

The memo was addressed to
F.B.l. Headquarters in
Washington, attd it stated: “The

"in this case. the mctno con—
tinued, "it tnigltt be appropriatedo
duplicate the feces of the species
Sus scrofa." Sus sct'ofa, according
to science textbooks, is another
name for the Europcatt wild boar.”

The memo concludes by stating
that, again quoting, “A quart supp-
ly, along witit a dispenser capable
of squirting a narrow stream for a
distance of approximately tltrcc
feel. would satisfy the needs of this
proposed technique."

The F.B.l. today refuses to com-
tnem on the memo. And a former
member of the Radical Education
Project says that. while a lot of
weird things did happen itt the early
i970’s to disrupt the project, an ob-
noxious stneil was ttot among tltctn.

As if acne. wasn't bad enough.
now one doctor is saying that some
acne creams may promote skin
cancer.

Dr. Thomas Siaga of the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory itt Ten-
nessee says his research has found
that benzoyi peroxide, combined
with other compounds, wasfound
to be a moderately strong'tttinor
promoter in mouse-skin cauccr
tests.

Benzoyl peroxide, Slaga says. is
the active ingredient in many acne
preparations. He says, however,
that tumor promoters often work
only in the company of other
l'actors--including sunlight.

Slaga says that, although there
are no tests available to
demonstrate the potential of tumor
promotioti in humans as a result of
bciwoyl peroxide, he is especially
conccrncd about people who use
the ncnc creams and spend tnttclt
time outdoors.

Singa suggests that lltosc of you
who have acne problems should

"stick to soap attd walcr, adding. “i

wouldn't want to see any tccnagcrs
usc preparations with bcn/ttyl
pcroxitlc to wash their faces on a
regular basis."

Dr. Alfred Levi of Harrow.
England, says that he had been
treating the patients with a drug
known as“sulfasalazine." He ‘
reports that virtually all of the men
became infertilc--ttnd were unable
to impregnate their wives--during
the drug treatment. ‘

Tests with the compound on
animals and on human volunteers
have found that the wives of treated
men did become pregnant and
delivered normal babies.

Dr. Levi says that a derivative of
stilfasalazine may soon be tested
widely as a male birth control pill.
