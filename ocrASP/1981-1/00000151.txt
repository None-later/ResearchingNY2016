PHILADELPHIA, PI. (AP) In-‘

diana Coach Bobby Knight created
an international incident at the 1979
Pan American Games in Puerto
Rico when he had a run-in with a
policeman.

He once threatened to go after
the next Michigan State fan who
shouted an obscenity at him.

7Another time, he grabbed a
microphone on his home court in
Bloomington, 1nd,, and said he
would take his team off the court if

. the fans would not stop chanting

obscenlties.

Now, it’s a shoving incldent over
an obscenity that has Knight in the
limelight again for his antics, not
his coaching, during the NCAA
basketball Final Four round in this
City of Brotherly Love. .

Knight says he doesn’t have to
take verbal abuse in public when it
includes Obscenities. He. has no
apologies for the shoving incident

 

  

in a New Jersey motel Saturday
'night, and, in fact, says he would
do the same thing again under
similar circumstances.

Knight's Hoosiers rolled into the
NCAA’championship game with an
easy 18-point victory over the Loui-
siana State University Tigers Satur-
d

the same motel as about 200 LSU
fans, had been taunted by the fans
prior to Saturday’s game with
chants of .“Tiger Bait, Tiger Bait,
here comes Tiger Bait."

So, when a Baton Rouge, La.,
accountant, Louis Bonnecaze, Jr.,
a man Knight said he had never seen
before, approached him and said.
“Congratulations,” the coach was
ready with a quick ansWer.

“We weren’tlreaily bait after all,

were we?" Knight said as they pass- -

ed in the hallway of Cherry Hill

inn.

According to Knight, the man.
turned around and shouted an
obscenity. “I walked over: to him,"
said Knight, “and asked him,
‘Would you like to say again what
you just said?’

“He said, ‘1 just gave you a com-
pliment and you were sarcastic.’ 1
said ‘1 wasn’t sarcastic.’ "

Knight said the man called him
an obscene name;‘and the coach ud-
ded: “So i grabbed him and shoved
him up against the wall and then
walked away. And if that means
I’ve done something wrong, so be

it.

"If it happens again tomorrow,~
Il’ll be wrong again‘tomorrow."

Tommy Neck, a member of
LSU's board of supervisors who
was in the motel lounge, said he
heard the Obscenities and saw the
shoving. -

“1 went over and got Bobby and
took him into my room for about
ﬁve minutes and we talked," said
Neck, who never had met Knight
before but knew him through
phone conversations.

Bonnecaze, who was still at the
motel Sunday night, was quoted by
the Baton Rouge Morn/rig Ad-
vocate as saying Knight grabbed
him by the throat and shoulder and
held him against the wall.

"My throat is still sore and bruis-
ed,” said Bonnecaze, who called
the police after the incident but did
not press charges. “1 could still

press charges, but I wouldn't do -

that unless I have to get an accurate
account of what happened to the
public."

“Lamp led all scorers wilit 25 and
Rakcr had 21. Cook topped LSU
with 21 and Mitchell had 16 before
fouling out on Lamp’s three-point

Virginia played the final 9 1/2

Sampson, who fouled out. Samp-
son did not start, as Virginia elected
to let five seniors take thc court for
the opening tipoff.

Sampson, a sophomore, had just

LSU, the No.4 team in the coun-
try, also got into foul trouble in the
very raggcdly played contest, which
all four of the coaches involved said
at one timcor another during the
past week should be dropped from
the final four rounds.

The Tigers lost their top scorer,

Bonds-No Trouble For Sugar Ray _

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) Although
he denies using Larry Bonds to
pracdce for figltts against tougher
left-handers, Sugar Ray Leonard
dbcsn't want anyone thinking he
was, in trouble against the low-
proﬁlc Denver boxerr I '

“So far, We heard more and
more excuses — he had been inac-
tive, he didn‘t like the referee, 1
punched after the bell,"‘Leonard
said Sunday. “But it was my vic-
tory. That seems difficttlt for the
public to accept, and it shouldn't be
that way."

The night before, the 24-year-old
Leonard floored Bonds twice —
once in the fourth round artd once
in the 10th — before rcfcrcc Arthur
Mcrcants stopped it after 2:22 of
the 10th round.

“Last night, everyone was saying
that Larry Bonds was not worthy to
step into the ring with me. But 1 had
to fuel him out. His style is hard to
deal with bccrtusc he stands irt front
of you, where most southpaws give
you just one side," he said.

Leonard, now 29-1, said he had
to adjust his tactics and "bully"
Bonds.

Earlier, middleweight Tony
Ayalrt ran his record to 9—0 by

knocking out Mario Maldonado in
the third round, and 1980 US.
Olympic Team members Johnny
Bumphus and Davey Meore scored
fourth-round TKOs to go 6-0 and
5-0, respectively.

Bernard Taylor and Alex Ramos,
two more unbeaten young boxers.
won six-round decisions.

The scheduled 15-round main
event in the Carrier Dome was
Leonard's first defense of the

World Boxing Council welterweight '

title since he regained it front
Roberto Duran last bfov. 25 at New
Orleans.

Next, he will challenge Ayttb
Kalule June 25 in Hottstott for the
World Boxing Association junior
middleweight championship.
Kalule, a Ugandan living in Don-
mark, also is a left-handcr.

After that Leonard will make
another welterweight title defense in
August and probably a big-money
claslt with Totnmy 1-lcttrns, tltc
WBA welterweight champion, in
the fall.

“It’s going to be a very big fight.
l’rn pretty excited about it, and I
think. it‘s going to happen in tire
fall," said Mike Trainer, Leonard's
attorney.

Trainer has said the s-foot-io
Leonard would only fight Hearns,
whoftis 4-1/2 inches taller, as a
welterweight. But Leonard said he
"would ﬁght Tommy Hcarns as a
heavyweight."

Leonard received an esﬁmated
$750,000 for the fight.

Bonds. 29, had never made moie
titan $1,500 in winninng 29 of 32
previous fights. He got $100,000
and some expostrrc.

“I didn‘t go 10 rounds with just
anybody, and a lot of people are
probably going to be calling just
becausc 1 did go 10," he said.

have to gut ready for the Pacers and
take it from there.”

Conch Rilly Cunningham was
confident his cluhwoulrl be ready

“I think this lcttttt will be able to

boutrcc back," sttid Cunningham,
who is expected to start his regular
lincttp of Erving turd Caldwell
Jones at forwards, Darryl Dawkins
at center and Maurice Checks and
Lionel Hollins at guards. Andrew
Toncy, a rookie who started in the
backcourt for much of the season,
will see frequent action off the

Indiana, 44-38, finisltcd third in

Pacers were unable to handle the
Sixers during the regular season,
Couch Jack McKinney was conﬁ-
don! the playoffs would be a dif-
ferent story.

“It’s ll short series and you just
have to get hot and win two
games,” he said. “Oh, there's a lit-
tle more intensity, but it's the same
doggone team you played six times
before."

The Pacers finished the season
with a 101-97 loss to Chicago -— the
Bulls’ eighth victory in a row. No
other team is riding such a hot
