Thrashes RPI. .
by Jeff Fredrieka , ' ,

There was a large turn-out Satur-
day as the Albany State Rugby Club
opened-its season against it?! on
the Soccer field. '

" . Two scores by Bill Stockwell, one
by senior co-captain Jim Johnson,
and John Veruto’s kick after led the
Albany team 'to'a 14-6 Victory over
a strong RPl team.

Albany led throughout the
match, and held up against late RPI ‘
pressure. Dane Steve Shoen,- who
had one score called back and
another run stopped short in some
confusion near the goal-line, was .
credited with a strong game, as was
the entire line. .

ThcAlbany “.8” team destroyed ,
the second squad from RPI, 72-0.
Albany’s great depth was the major
cause for the severe mismatch
Q'tiality line play set the stage for
ruggch John Durant, Dave Strauh,
and Sam Nuv‘on to contribute to the
cause with multiple scores \each.
