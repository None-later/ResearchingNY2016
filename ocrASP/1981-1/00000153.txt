Fonda Film to be Shot Here

by Susan Mllllgan

Scenes frotn the upcoming film
Rollover, starring Jane Fonda, Kris
Kristofferson, arid Hittite Crornytn
will be shot at the Empire State
Plaza atrd on the SUNYA campus
i1e.\'t week, according to the film's
location manager Celia (.‘ostrts.

The film conccrrts international
finance. arid is bcittg sltot in Moroc—
co and iii parts of New York State.
SUNYA was selected as the site of a
ficticious international business
conference because its strtictttrc is
very sirttilar to the tnodcrti corti-
piexcs now being btiill in the Middle
East, Costas said.

Most of the filming on caniptts
will take plrtcc iii the Assembly
Hall. although sortie exterior
shooting may be done, she said.

“If we do exterior shooting, we
may have to reroute you slightly,"
Costas explained, “but it will not
prevent stttderils from goittg about

their business."
Scenes will be sltot at the Etttpirc
State Plaza early next week, and the

film crew will be at SUNYA
Wednesday through Friday. she
said.

Fonda portrays an actress, l.cc‘

Norman. rttarricd to the chair of tire
board of a large pctro-clrcmicnl cor-
poration. Norman‘s husband dies;
tltc story rltctt centers on the ac-
tivitics of a well known ttcltcss»
turned-businesswontan.

Typical of Fonda's films. the
riiovic presents a social cotntitettt.
Coslas said the filtti is “more infor-
mative than anything else" arid pro-
titotes “an acquaintanccship with
international finance.

“There are a lot of issues irt
play,“ Cosltts explained.
“Basically, it‘s about a wotnan try-
ing to ittake a stab at playitig a

Field House Plan is Reeonsidered

Assassination Attempt Examined

 

Reagan Convalescing

WASHINGTON (AP) President Reagan, his
recovery called “really amazing" from a wound
that doctors say might have killed trim, probably
was struck by a ricochcting bttllet rather than a

direct shot, sources say.

Now itt his third day of convalescence. the

White House Counselor Edwin Meese III
said Reagan may be released frotn George

said the president is still platttting to travel to
San Diego, Cttlif.. April 27-28 to meet with Mex-

Hinckley May be Indicted

WASHINGTON (AP) A federal magistrate to-
day sent the case of Joltn W. Hincklcy. Jr. to a
federal ttrand jury to decide whether the 25-year-
old loner should be indicted in the attempted
assassination of President Reagan.

Hinckley, wearing a white, bullet-proof vest
under his dark blue sport coat, sat silently as his
lawyer. Vincent Fuller. waived the requirement
that the governtnerit show probttble cause that a
crime was committed.

Magistrate Lawrence Margolis then settt his
case directly to a grand jury.

“It is just something we're look-
irtg at." said O‘Leary, emphasizing
the explatory nature of his discus-
siotts with Corning abottt the facili-
ty. “We just talked informally
about it.”

SUNYA Athletic Director Robert
Ford noted that in his Il years at
the university, such a proposal was
made “probably three times."

“Although the SUNY Board of
Trustees would recorntnend it,"
O'Leary added. “it never got by the
Department of Bridget." Brit Corn-
ing ttssertcd that no past proposal
has ever “been brought up to Ilte
extent that it is now.”

The sottrcc of funding for such a
project is uttdccided. Cornirtg said
that it probably would be owrtcd by
New York State, with the city of
Albany “participating” in , the
costs. Corning wettt on to speculate
that the facility might be operated
jointly by the state and the city.

Tire city's interests lie in its own
lack of athletic facilities uttd
O'Leary said that several city and
state administrators “are concerned
about getting other facilities."

O‘Leary emphasized the need for
contniunity support in the project,
bttt still maintained that his primary
objective is to increase the indoor
recreational space for the students.

“We have to get a plan that both
(university and community) people
will support,“ said the president.
"I'm interested in buildings that
students can use."

“I'm very enthttsiastlc about it,"
Corning said. He also expressed
hopes that the proposed facility
would house not only SUNYA and
city-based sports events, bttt profes-

sional ones as well.

When the present SUNYA cam-
pus was built. it was planned to
contain a field house, as well as
separate gyms for both then and
women. However, due to state eut-
backs on construction, other
buildings of higher priority were-
built artd the field house plans were
cancelled.

“We were well on our way to a
second Physical Education
building," said Vice President for
Finance and Business Joltrt Har-
tigait. “Whatever happened, the
thing died."

The SUNYA campus was
originally intended to be "twice as
large“ as it is trow, accordiitg to
Hartigan. But a decision was tirade
to halt expansion on physical
education facilities and opt for
more aeadctnic space. So the pro-
posed field house was never built.

“I don‘t think it was a campus
decision," Hartigan said, "but the
decision was made not to go With
physical education."

Since then, the university has
been unable to get the support
needed to build the ﬁeld house or
any new buildings, from the Capital
Construction Budget. which con-
trols funds for new construction
and building rehabilitation, Har-
tigan said. ~

Considering the congestion that
often occurs in the gym, O'Leary.
Hartigan and Ford all expressed not
only a desire, but a necessity for ex-
pansion of SUNYA'S present
facilities.

"In terms of the size we are and
the number of students we have,"
O'Leary said. "we need it . . . I
think It's imperative that we have
