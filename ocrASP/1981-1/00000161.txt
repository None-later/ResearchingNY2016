'thought I'd' be spending last
weekend at home, so I stocked up
on plenty of Mallomars. a gallon of

milk and a pile of Richie Rich comics. Cable
looked great: a lot of the movies were rated

the Bombln' Brahmlns of New Delhi against

Day One

1 met two other representatives on the
chartered-plane out of Kennedy Airport: a
reporter from the Brockport Stylus. and the
nutrition editor from the Harvard Crimson.
The Harvard guy embarrassed everybody by
studying during the entire trip. and the
Brockport fellow seemed desperately in
search of a nickname. He Introduced himself
as “Scoop.” but later on asked that I just call
him “Buck.” I had no Intention of calling him
at all. and pretended l was concentrating on

», the In-fllght movie. though I'd forgotten to

buy headphones.
. Touching down in Battle Creek. our little
entourage was greeted by Kellogg's press
secretary. "Call me Henry.” he urged. I said
he could do the same and Buck now asked If
he could be called Henry as well. "No. make
that Hank." he added.

Henry had us all cllmb Into'a VW mini-bus
which had "Kellogg's All-Van" written on the
side. and whisked us off to the gleaming
milk-white architecture of the Kellogg com-
plex.

“You'll note each street Is named after our
most famous cereals. Battle Creek would
have II no other way." said Henry. Arid sure
enough. we were making a right on Product
19th street. then turned left at the corner of
Honey and Nut. before circling the factory
on the Froot Loop. We were shown our ac—
comodatlons at Crispie House. and told we
could wash up before the afternoon's first
meeting. ‘

That first meeting was held outdoors lit a
small stadium which was normally used for
intramural football and soccer games. and
bore the unforgettable name. The Cereal
Bowl. Henry addressed some two hundred
of us and asked that we lay aside all previous
prejudices and misconceptions we garnered
concerning Journalism and Its relationship
with Breakfast In general. and Cereal in par-
tlcular. I admitted to myself that I had no

such preconceptions. although i had often
wondered why the ratio of marshmallow bits
to rolled oats was so low In a box of Lucky
Charms. I thought I'd save that until the
question and answer period.

The Harvard guy was scribbling down
everything Henry said. Including some garbl-
ed curses when the sound system started
making these screeching noises. That under

The five of us on hand for the first area ap-
pearance of the French art—rock band.
Dildeaux Flambe'aux. were so disgusted that
all of us (except Vinnie who had to stay and
turn off the lights) packed It up around 12:30
and split for 288 where something‘s always
happening. Now. there’s a good time and I
should probably write about that Instead. but
the editors here are so big on J.B. Snolt's
that they insisted I review the Dildeaux even
though they sucked snot.

A word about the band: _They call
themselves a French art-rodk group but ac-
tually they‘re a garage band from East
Greenbush. The lead guitarist. Simon
LeGrew. Is a former French chef who was
fired from his last job due to what LeGrew
calls “a minor problem with hyperactive
‘°“"‘“V Blends." But he has a real apprecia-
tion (or anything French (“El ticlally kisses

control. Henry proceeded to introduce some
of the Kellogg executives. Here's a fun fact:
four out of the seven Vice-Presidents at
Kellogg's are named Chet. No kidding.
Henry had each stand up and_gtve his name
and which branch of the company he was in-
volved in. and each dealt with some aspect
of Ingredient making. “So you see." said
Henry. “we‘have wheat Chets. Rice Chels.
and Corn Chetsl" The crowd exploded at
this. but I somehow suspected many
depended on Henry for their jobs.

After the meeting, In which Henry did an
admirable job In tying together the two
themes of newspaper reporting and
breakfast cereal (one metaphor was par-

ticularly convincing: the news was the high- .

grain fiber. the paper-is the milk. the reporter

tour the factory Itself. It was laslnatlng. and
taught me more about cereal making than I
deserved to know.

Most of the process ls mechanized. of
bourse — the rolling. baking. boxing and
sealing. But what 1 never realized is that
many of the more complex cereals —- the
Froot Loops. Graham Crackos. and the
Sugar Smacks. are In fact made by hand.
Froot Loopers cut tiny lengths off of these
huge reels. then shape them into their

distinct doughnut shape. The true craftsmen
are the Sugar Smackers. who take the baked
blocks of dough and carve them Into the
delicate sea shell-shape of the Smack.

One of the more colorful and repulsive

characters we met was a corn flake mixer
who asked that we call him Floyd. Brockport
was now calling himself Chet. and i took ad-

vantage of Floyd's outpatient status and

demanded that he call me “Your Highness.r

busted. But it turned out to be a publicity
stunt. Half an hour later another roadie
came In. advising that the band had been In
a rumble and were seriously messed up. We
figured It was itist another trick but It turned
out to be true. The Dildeaux had been drink-
lrtg up in sotne bar In Nassau when the
drummer accldently Insulted some Hell's
Angels girlfriend. Turned out the Angel was
particularly sensitive to gorilla cracks (he's
often mistaken for one) and pulled a swll-
chblade on the drummer. The rest of the
Dildeaus jumped In. as did some attendant
bikers. and they proceeded to engage in a lit-
tle ultraviolence till about 11:15 when one
handmember remembered they lied a 9'9
that night. arid asked the Angels If they
couldn't resume at some later date. The
Angel. tough but fair. agreed to the sugges-
tion. For those of you who may be In~
terested. they're scheduled to have It out
next Thursday at JB's around 11. Or
whenever the Units get dune.

Anyway. the band. bruised and tattered. \

arrived at midnight. To tell you the truth. we
were looking‘ forward to the show by this
time. The other customer In the place -— the

Beat Rap

To the Edltor:

1 am a junior female cocd at SUNYA. I
would like to relate an incident which cc-
curred last weekend that has left me
dismayed and disgusted with this universi-
ty’s interpretation of the Fifth Amcndmcnt.
The question here is what is the role of the
university; is it to educate and enlighten or
to act as “guardians in abscnlia" to the -
students. Let me relate the incident which
has prompted me to write this letter.

At approximately 1:15 am. on Saturday
morning. my boyfriend Bucko and l were
engaging in our 'favoritc sexual diversion
when my RA burst into my room. Needless
to say, I was extremely embarrassed to be
caught in such a compromising position but
from the look on Itcr face I thought Reagan
had just bombcd El Salvador.

I soon discovcrcd that it was the nature
of our act that left her with such an
astonished look. Honestly. what’s wrong
with a few whips. chains. spikes and hand-
cuffs in today's society? I know it’s not
widcly accepted and if I hadn't been scram-
ing so loudly I would ltuvc quickly hid my
painful aids before the RA entered the
room. But as we say in my circlcI “different
smacks for different Jacks (or Johns)."

My main reason l'or writing is not to con-
front my RA's disapproval of my actions.
Ratlicr. I‘m infuriated by the Dutch Quad
dorm director’s decision to confiscate all of
Bticko‘s and my painfully plcnsurnblc
gadgets. What right do tltcy have to take
away my whip, my chain and my
clotlicspins? Tltcsc are things I enjoy and
need. At least they had the decency to leave
tttc my lcatltcr. ci'otcltlcss. delicately spiked
evening wear. because without it I couldn't
function.

i feel like a woman whose life’s blood has
been sucked out of hcr, I can‘t take my
classes seriously and all else has taken a
back scat to my quest to regain my “aids.”

I ask for the support of thc SUNYA com-
muitity to Iipr me in my plight to regain my
property. Students: no longer are we
minors and at the mercy of the school. We

 

' must stand up and fight for our legal rights.

And frankly. since last weekend. Bucko
and 1 simply can’t do it anymore. I’Icasc
rally to my old, I'm a desperate. hungry
woman in need. Remember. it’s hip to bc

whipped.
—— Suzie B. Brutal

 

Big.'Bad and Green

To the Editor: '

Personally, i loath the green SUNYA
buses. I harbor a dccp implicit fear that
they are slowly driving me out of my mind.

I hear them driving past my Washington
Ave. apartment both day and night. I hear
the monotone rumbling of tltcir engines as
they slowly but steadily shift through the
gears. 1 see their drab grccn bodies with dir-
ty white stripes. Even as I sit ltcrc in my liv-
ing room writing this, I can ltcar anotltcr
one pass by.- They seem like an army of
mechanical servants. i can’t gct away frottt
lhcm — I believe tltcy are following me.

It is safe to say that the green buses have
ruined my life. I had to take out a loan to
buy a car because I can't ride the buscs
anymore without a scvcrc anxiety attack. In
order to pay off the loan. 1 had to get tijob.
Because of the job I no longer have time to
do schoolwork ttiid tliil fltinking out of col-
lege. One day I went ottt and bought a
shotgun so I could shoot the bus tlrcs out its
they (.lI'lVC by. As a rcstilt. my roommates
have moved out.

The following is not a nightmare but it
true story. Onc weekend it cotiplc of friends
and myself decided that we needed to get
out of Albany. We decided to drive down to
Hartford. Conticctlctil to see it fiddle cont
test. It was a beautiful day as we jumped in-
to my friend's car. I was especially cxcttcd
at the thought of no SUNY buses for an en-
the day! The sun shown brightly as we got

played on the radio. We were about 30
miles out of Albany as we ﬂew around a
blind curve. My eyes nearly popped out of
my head at what I saw —- FIVE GREEN
SUNY BUSESIII My chcst tightened up
and I had trouble breathing. I told my
friend to speed up but it was no use. We
could not get awayl I was certain that they
were going to follow us all the way to Hart-
ford. Thcy finally got off at an exit about a
half an hour later. Nevertheless. it was too
late -—- my day was ruined and I haven’t
been the same since.

To the Editor:

For years we've heard that thc Kick in Hip
ASP is the best paper in the entire SUNY
system. Well. we've read. and read this so-
callcd paper — and we hate to say it; this
paper is still.

We've never seen such ltorscsitit from
such a bunch of uninformed. unfortunate
ptitzcs wlto'vc cvcr aspired to llic profes-
sion of journalism. It’s rt wontlct' anyone
reads it. We can‘t imagine anything more
instilling to human intclllgcncc.

 

The verdict as wc see it is that thosc
students who have worked for this Diljic‘t‘ hc
recommended to tltc “Gcncrtil Alcxtmticr

Fattened Cow

To the Editor:

We Americans are so fortunate to live in
the country which foreigners dccm “The
Land of Plenty." a latid seemingly
overflowing with — ugh i— milk and honey.
As I've noticed. the nice ladies in the
Ratliskcllar and commuter cafeteria also
seem to feel there is a frightening surplus of
cream cheese. I would like to address this
little dissertation to them.

Come on. ladies. enough is enough!
You're not trying to fatten up thc starving
children in Biafra. I simply. cannot tolcratc
another sub-standard sesame bagel
smothered with a one-pound scoop of
generic cream cheese. Three years ago. as
B11 unworldly freshman from the boon-
docks upstatc. I wouldn’t have known what
a bagel was if the Bagel Baron tapped mc
art the shoulder and shook ottc undcr my
nose. Cream Cheese was simply tltc main in-
gredient in mom's blueberry cltccsccrtkc.

As I acclimated myself in tlic
predominately down-slate Jewish. am-
biancc of SUNYA. I realized that in order
to maintain the snug fit of my Calvins,
bagels became a vital. daily necessity.
However, thanks to all you nicc UAS
ladies. I now have to be in a horizontal
position to “zip up." And I point my
pudgy. accusing finger at your overwhelm—
ing generosity in slapping on the cream
cheese. it's sweet of you to give us our
money’s worth. ‘causc God only knows we
have to pay enough. but please draw the
line somewhere! Perhaps you might all
learn a lesson In cream-cheese moderation
from the bagel-selling members of Delta
Sigma Pi (who. by the way. needn't be quite
so stingy). There has to be a happy
