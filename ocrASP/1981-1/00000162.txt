Try and try again is one old adage
that Red Aucrbach likes to live by.
L'ast year. Aucrbach tried to lure
then-freshman sensation Ralph
Sampson out of his college career at
Virginia to join his Boston Celtics.
Failing at that, he dccidcd to make
another try for the type of college
center that could, as he put it,
assure the NBA franchise of a
league litlc.

This time, he has succccdcd.

And this limc, it is John

by More "us To

Out: of the most deserving nrcn in
lhc univcrsily sports community ililh
finally rcccivctl a promotion. Aftcr
l4 years of long, luird s‘crvicc to thc
Albany State nthlclic dcpru'lmcnl,
Equipment Munngcr llcnnic Sicgcl
has bccn chosen to succch Robcrt

> Ford as Athletic Director.

"0y ch, it's about lirrrc i got u
misc," said Sicgcl, who can always
bc l‘ountl iltll‘lyillg rtll mound
Univcrsily Gym with it iruntlrcd
different keys dangling from his
belt. "They always complain that
the bats are cracked. the towels dir-
ty and now they went me to be the
AD.”

Sicgcl is one of the best known
men behind the scenes at University
Gym. He is always called upon
whcpcvcr a problem arises. Anyone
who needs help is always told "Ask
Bcnnic."

Surely, the university has
bencfitcd'from his presence over the
last l4 years. Bcsidcs serving the
varsity athletic teams, he has pro-
vided reliable service to those just
using Albany's facilities.

"I don't know where I would
have been without Bennie," said
former Athletic Director and pre-
sent Albany State head football
coach Robert Ford. "I still don't
know where he keeps our helmets."

Others in the department have
complimented Sicgel, especial-
on his enthusiasm towards
Albany sports.

and a button in the center.

“I’ve been looking for one of
those since high school,"
Dicckclman said, “but I can never
seem to find the right one. if l'm
going to play up there, they have to
get me one."

"Whatever he wants," Aucrbach
said, "he gets. Bill Russell's locker,
a cap — I don't care if he wants to
sit in my ofﬁce and smoke my cigars
after the games. JD is the man i
want, and if he thinks he needs
something, i think he's going to get
it."

 

:tPagIrid Slate" 

The jump from Division III 1
basketball to the professional ranks
is one that no player in history has
been able to.make, so why does
Aucrbach think that Dicckclman
can?

“Okay, I'll admit that he's not all
that tall, and he's not all that quick.
and he can’t jump all that well,"
Aucrbach said. “But when you'vc
been in the business of building,
basketball dynasties as long as l
have, you can just tell. John has
Boston written all over his face. We
know he's going to make it."

 

. . . Witt-n ill‘ puts on the gnu-n and while rrulform of tile Boston Celtics.

“licnnic'h lllliilltiL‘ could really
hcip n lL‘tllli. if only he won: tlrrcc
fch lnlicr," Albuny Slulc llctrd
lntskctbnil conch Dick Strucrs corri-
rncnlcd, rcl'crt‘ing t'o Sicgcl‘s luck of
hcighl.

“l'm rcuily plcrrscd thnl thcrc is a
man on the sports stuff that gich it
damn about the women‘s lcnnrs.
l-‘oru guy, he isn't so bud," said
Albany Slulc women's track couch
Bar'lntrrt l’ulm.

To llcnnic, Albany sports is not
just a job, it's a way of life. He is
really proud of thc job he has done
over thc last I4 years though he ad-
mits there have been some problems
along the way.

“For instance," Bcnnic remark-
cd, “we always have trouble
deciding which towels are really dir-
ty when wc have to send them out
to be cleaned —— once a month."

But Sicch loves the interaction
with the athletes most of all. He has
maintained long-lasting relations
with those who have graced the
hallways of University Gym.

"Bonnie's a cool dude. Each spr-
ing hc invites me to have Passover
dinner with him. It's funny how he
can be both an excellent equipment
manager and a great Jewish cook at
the same time," said former basket-
ball standout Winston Royal.

Now Siegcl has a new job con-

fronting him. As the new athletic,

director, he envisions a great and
promising future for sports here at

Albany. First, he plans to acquire
5,000 ncw purplc and gold towels to
cnimncc school spirit.

“i’coplc fch vcry protrd of their
school when lhcy wcnr its colors
around thcir privates," Sicgcl cx-
pluincd. ‘

llc is also a strong advocate of
Title IX and hopes to institute n
ncw \vonrcn's football team. He
l'ccls this type of program will allow
women who are too fat for regular
varsity sports to play.

“I think cvcry womun under Title
IX, no matter what their size,
should be able to play inter-
collegiate sports," Sicgcl said.

Also, the new athletic director '
wants to reinstate the now defunct
mcn's volleyball team. According
to Sicgel, "Albany State has a lot of
balls and nets not being used, that
are just laying around in the equip-
ment cage.

"Anyway," he added, "what this
school really needs is Ted Earl."

 .. Albany Finds New A.D.—And it’s Bennie Siege]

However, as Athletic Director,
Sit:ch has no intention of abandon-
ing his lovable checrleading image.
Siegel has always helped out the
cheerleaders at football games and
maintains that he will continue to
do so.

“l'm still gonna go out there with
the girls to root the Danes on. Stan-
ding among thosc girls with the
bodies they have can make any old
guy feel young, even a guy like
hie," said Slcgcl.
