He won. That was sufficient
within itself. After all, in the words
of the late Vince Lombardi,
“winning isn‘t everything —— it's the
only thing."

It is bizarre how we as a nation
not only tolerate but even admire
and hall a person's actions which,
under any other circumstances,
would be a source of derision.

“That's ottr boy, Bobby,“ they
say with a giggle. “What a card."

“Ain't it the truth? He's a win-
ner."

Winning makes everything all

Winning Makes EVerything'All Right?

Whenever you try to probe into
the inner soul of the Marine-
syndrome, spit-and-polish, tough-
guy personality of tnen such as
Knight —— also General Patton,
Lombardi. Woody Hayes and, to a
lesser degree. George Steinbrenner
— you run into all sorts of con-
ﬂicts.

Knight's personality - as in the
case of other renowned marlinets ——
runs the broad gamut frotn the
foul-talking, chair-kicking, face-
slappiag bully to an off-stage
charmer with a seeming concern for
the impressionable human clay lie is
cotnmisioncd to mold. '

What really bugs us is that 'Bobby
Knight. two days after shoving a
Louisiana State fan against the wall
and dumping him in a plastic con-
tainer, suddenly is pictured as some
kind of protector of mod :rn virtues

. and morals.

The lndiana coach makes no ef-
fort to clean up his own act. It's sil-
ty for him to get incensed over at
fan's ribbing. it’s indisereet of him
to push human beings around,
stand before a houseful of reproters
and scream the vilest profanities.

If he is truly a great character
builder, why shouldn't he build his
own? As the Bible says.
"Physician, heal thyself."

"Our team speed came through
again. we played a tough man-to- ..
man defense and denied their big
man the ball," said RIIL‘I. referring
to Schmitr, who scored l4 points
and was one of the slandottt players
in Leagnc lV.

“Super defense by Vehillics and
good wettkside help" was the
reason Rac/ gave for the shutdown

played tough and their two guards
(Raw and Kenny Trotta) are very
quick. They played organized and
intelligently. it was the organization
that won it for them.“ he said.

University Gym contains a main
gym (with three full basketball
courts), two auxiliary gyms
(containing volleyball and gym-
nastic equipment), four racquetball
courts, four squash courts. a weight
training room, a dance studio, a
swimming pool. and locket-rooms in
addition to physical education of-
fices. Students have access to arty of
these, except when any one of
SUNYA'S 26 intercollegiate teams,
or one of its four indoor intramural
programs desires to use them.

“it would be nice." Ford said,
referring to what he called the sad
state of affairs of the overcrowded
gym. “to have a few more facilities
for l0.000 (undergraduate)'
students."

O'Leary said that he has con-
sidered other alternatives to the
field house, which include artificial
turf installation on the existing
football field and the construction
of a protective dome over it. But
neither of these, he said, are suffi-
cient to suit the students’ needs.

Both O'Leary and Corning

.strongly stressed that the proposal

is just in the planning stage and that
much work has to be done before '
anything concrete is done.

"We've got what many people
think is a darned good idea," Corn-
ing said optimistically.

But O'Leary maintained his
reservations. “Probably, if it look-

ed promislng." he said, “I might
put together a committee on cam-
pus (to look into it).

real. It scents to me that we and to
