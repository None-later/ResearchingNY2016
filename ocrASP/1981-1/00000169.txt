Baseball is an integral part of spr-
ing and losing has been an integral
part of baseball at Albany State for
most of the last few years.

But this year could be different.

Things are beginning to fall into
place for the young Danes. Tremen-
dous hitting, as usual, balanced
with tight defense, excellent team
speed, and a solidifying pitching
staff all may help head coach Rick
Skeel and ltis assistant coaches Gus
Faddoul and Chuck Hutchinson br-
ing winning baseball to Albany. But
there is another very inrportatit fac-
tor — this team has a winning at-
titude.

“l’m trying to reverse drastically
what was a dead end street — there
was basically a country club at-
titude on the team." said Skeel.
“Brit the program has done it 180

’ degree swing. We're headed iii the

right direction."

“l‘m very high on this team," lre
continued. “These kids — they're
going to win some this spring."

This past fall the Danes ﬁnished
at 9-8, improving upon a dismal
12-19 mark iti 1979-80. Bttt there is
an even greater difference than
won-lost record. Six of this team's
eight losses in the fall were by a
single run. This team averaged 8.5
runs per game and batted .362 as a
unit. And this team continued to

impress by breaking with the losing
tradition on more than one occa-
sion.

“We beat an exlrerncly strong
Westfield Stale team that we don't
ever beat, and we beat Oneonla iti
Oneonta which we haven‘t done in
a long time," Skeel tinted.

in addition, the learn has compil-
ed an 8—6 record itt their version of
the Grapefruit League when they
traveled to Florida and then came
back north where they have been
scrimmaging other local learns.
Their sttcccss ltas tlictn thinking
that they cart witt, according to

 

Skeel.

“Florida gave them a shot of
conﬁdence. They have a full head
of steam now,” he said.

Strength up the middle has long
been considered by students of
baseball as the backborte of a \vinn-
ing ballclttb. ifsuclt is the case, then
Albany just may have a winner on

their hands witlt a unanimous all-‘

 

    
 

Skeel believes he has a top-notch
tandem at it shortstop and second
base in junior Bob Tortorello, a
probe” candidate, and Francis
Rivera who complement each other
beautifully.

“Those two guys look like major
leagtie players sometimes," Skeel
reflected.

‘AMIA Intramural Hoop Champions Determined

by Phil Plvnlek

With Spring upon us, it's ﬁtting
that Albany's Winter intramural
season came 'to an end. Floor
Hockey'ﬁnished last weekend, and
this past week the curtain closed on
basketball.

Wednesday night there was quite
an upset in the League 11 champion-
ship game. The Untouchables, who
had lost to Nicc-n-Easy twice this
season,.beat them when it counted,
in the title game,'47-46. The winn-
ing point was made by Preston
Hamilton on a foul shot with no
time remaining.

Keith Duckett led the ﬁrst half
charge for Nice-n-Easy as they
grabbed a 25-18 halftime advan-
tage, but that was where the advan-
tage ended. Mike Gaines went on a

tear for the Untouchables, hitting.
10 of ti shots from the field in the
second half to help tie the game at
46.
“Mike was hitting the whole
half," was the way Nice-n-Easy
Centaur Duckett described the

Untouchables took control, and at
the buzzer Nice-rt-Easy center
Kelvittdones fouled Hamilton, who
hit the free throw for the victory.

Duckett blames overconfidence
on the part of his team for losing
the game. “We beat them twice in
the regular season and some of our
guys thought m had it won before
‘the game even started," he said.

The League 111 title game was
held Tuesday night and it was the
Surgeons winning a hardfought
37-34 game over the Werewolves.
The Surgeons had a 20-9 halftime
lead thanks to the work of point
guard ~Brian Ranney, who scored
eight points in the ﬁrst half and set
up many other baskets.

The Surgeons were in command
despite the fact that their center
Ned Miller. had three fouls called on
him in the ﬁrst 10 minutes.

The first two and a half minutes
of the game saw the Surgeons run
off four straight ﬁeld goals and in-
crease their lead to 28-9. Ranney
had'two of those buckets. one was
an Andy Franklin layup and the
other a Mike Gartman ltook. At

Surgeons were capitalizing on these

The next two and a half minutes
belonged to the Werewolves. They
straightened themselves out, played
scrappy defense, and cut the lead to

and a one ltandcr inside by Steve
Slater. Ned Miller hit a S-footcr
that got the lead back up to 15, bttt
the Werewolves kept on plugging.

They netted eight straight points
to cut the lead to seven with six and
a half minutes to play. Kevin
McDonough had two baskets in
that spurt, with Slater and Brian
Quinn getting the others. Ranncy
and Rick Cornell each sank a foul
shot to run the lead to nine, but
Doolan's drive knocked it back
down to seven. ' y

The Werewolves kept hustlittg
but Andy Franklin finished them
off by nailing four free throws
within a minute, the last two com-
ing with 1:30 remaining. That gave
the Surgeons an insurmountable

Desperation fouling was the next
order for the Wolves. it paid off as
Ranney made only one of two free
shots, and Drew Kaplan catnc down
court and followed Slater’s miss
with a layup to cut the lead to five.
The Wolves then fouled Gartman,
he missed twice, but the
Werewolves missed two oppor-
tunities to score before Darlan hit a
jumper at the buzzer to end the
game.

“We never thought we were out
of it. We were even as far as re-
bounds went, but we missed a lot of
easy shots underneath," said
MeDonougb, the Werewolve cap-
tain. "The Werewolves were the
biggest team we played all year.
Credit Rick Cornell with getting a
lot of key rebounds, and of course
Brian Ranney played just great,"
stated Franklin.

in the League 1V championship
game, the Blue Balls edged Conven-
tional Onslaught 37-32.

Onslaught got out to an early 8-4
lead thanks to the hot shooting of

‘Tony Schmitz. They ran the lead to

 SUN Y Trustees Come from Varied Backgrounds

 

by Judie Eisenberg

The SUNY Central Building itt
downtown Albany is an elaborate
concrete stt'trctttrc which looks as
official and tire-twentieth century
as any bitildittg containing
bureaucratic offices 1v right down
to thc marble-inlaid lobby.

Tilt: bont'dr'oorrt located on the
topmost floor, however, is marked
by_ ultra-modern bcants which jttt
ottt iti unconventional angles,
covered 'by light-wood grooved
paneling. The conference-table iii
the tttiddlc of the fool" is really ti
series of smaller tables pttsltcd
together, made of the same light-
wood as the panelling that gives
tlrem art almost unfinished ap—
pearance. 'Ceratnic jttgs and
sculptures sit on the tables.

it is in this room that the SUNY
Board of Trustees meet mice a
montlt to mandate university

policy. Through communications
they receive regularly at the two-day
rttectitigs held lterc, and also when
not itt Albany, they review and
coordinate the budgets us well as
manage the lands, buildings, equip—
ment and facilities of tire 64 schools
in the SUNY system.

They are also responsible for up-
pointing the administrative hend of
each campus, prescribing qualifica—
tions for students' continued enroll-
tttcrtt arid regulating curricula. Tltcy
fttlfill tltesc responsibilities without
receiving pay. although Secretary of
the University Martha Dowrtcy said
trustees receive compensation for
costs incurred while carrying out
lllcil‘ duties.

The Board of Trustees consists of
16 members, 15 of whom are ap-
pointed by the governor with the
advice and consent of the State
Senate. Their 10-year terms are

staggered; two positions expire with
odd year, while one position expires
every even y'at‘. The sixteenth
member, tiic Strident Assertiny ol‘
the State University (SASU) l’rcsi»
dent, serves only one yerrr. Students
have been voting members of the
board since 1975.

According to Assistant Secretary
to the Governor for liductttion [M
Friedman, potential lrttstccs ttl't.‘
jttdgcd on the degree of invohe-
tncrtt iti civic and business interests
they‘ve shown iii the past. and on
the amount of tittic they lntvc to
devote to the new position. The
governor also attempts to maintain
equal representation of minorities,
as well as pcrsotts frorti varied
geographic locations, he said, bttt
trustees are “chosen mostly on the
basis of their interest in ptrblic
higher education, regardless of their
own educational background."

Presently, only three of the 15
trustees appointed by the govertior
have attended SUNY schools, attd
only one of these three has attended
that school sittcc it was incor—
porated irtto the SUNY system.
Two tr ttstccs attended the Universi-
ty of Buffalo wlicti it was privately
operated btrt, Ericdntztti said,
bccantc extremely ittvolvcd iti the
school's operations when it later
joined tltc SUNY System.

.ltltlilil Davidsort Moyers, a nine
year member of the board, clairiis
to be “the first trustee to graduate
frortt a public college —— the Univer-
sity of Texas."

However, her children do not at-
tend SUNY schools.

Moyers, who is married to New
York City TV broadcaster Bill
Moyers (Bill Moyers Journal,
WPBS~TV), is not presently
employed. 'But she has been active

in many civic and community
organizations in addition to being a
SUNY Trustee.

The other trustees have also been
involved in various organizations,
although they vary widely itt their
interests and their range of ex-
périences.

lilinken is the Senior Vice President
and Chairman of tire Exccutive
Committee of EM. Warbnrg. Fin-

firm founded by his father. Warren
has been active in civic and frater-
nal organizations, and has received
