Community Service Keeps Volunteers in Action .

by Sue Smith

In the spring of 1970 student pro-
tests ragcd throughout college cam-
puses across the United States.
Students began to demand more
options in education; they wanted
the means to receive credit for their
work relating to community issues.

One outcome of the students"

protests and demands on the
SUINYA campus was the Communi-
ty Service Program (CSP) which of-
fers students the opportunity to
receive a maximum of six credits for
doing volunteer work in the Albany
area.

Statistics show that since the
beginning of the program, approx-
imately 5,000 SUNYA students
have spent more than 375,000 hours
volunteering through CSP.

Currently 850 students are in-
volved in 200 different agencies.
These includé the Capital District
Psychiatric Ccntcr, WMHT TV-
FM. Common Cause, Tiny Tot Day
Care Center, New York Albany
News and the Rape Crisis Center.

According to Dirccror Hcdi
McKinley, CSP is a nonprofit
organization working with non-

' profit agencies. The program is run

by McKinley, assistant Linda
Ohlcrking, and a studcni-run board
of directors.

This program bcgnn thrcc days
before Fall '70 classcs began, when
Academic Vicc Prcsidcnt Clrarlcs
O‘Rcilly discussed with Mclvin L.
Urol'sky ot' the Officc of innovative
Education the possibility of im-
plementing u community scrvicc
program of modcst proportion that
summer. Dcspiic worries over a
hastily-planned, poorly-run
organization, Urol'sky wanted to

prove to the students the good faith
of the organization.

Urofsky began the program by
meeting with representatives of
several community agencies, in-
cluding the local medical center, the
Legal Aid Society, the League of
Women Voters, the American Red
Cross and several settlement
houses. After a series of meetings
and intensive planning, the task
force planned the ﬁnal meeting —
the student interest meeting.

Sixty students were expected to
attend. but over 250 showed up.
Within the next three days, 225
students were interviewed and plac-
ed in 60 different agencies.

Ten years later, the program is
still operating and has been very
successful, said O'Rcilly.‘

There will be a limit of 600
students in the CSP in the upcom-
ing fall semester.

gram more manageable.

Community service voluntccrs
sometimes obtain full-iimc posi-
lions in the agencies they work for.
Student Kennth Rohatyn, for in-
stance, was offered a summer job
after completing his volunlccr
credits at the New York State
Library.

Rcccntly, Rolratyn stated his
rcnsons for volunteering at ihc New
York State Library. “I felt i had to
get away from SUNYA classrooms
and exams for a while. ercn you'rc
in ihc working world you see a dif-
ferent side of life. i work at scrial

' controls and it's the first titnc I've

ever had a desk job. I think all ma-
jors should require this."

Many students, like Ncil
Bccourtcny. who volunteered his

According to ‘
McKinley, this will make the pro- '

time to SUNYA's Big Brothers and
Big Sisters Program, found com-
munity service to be extremely
rewarding. '

“When i went to register I didn't
even realize it was for credits. After
an orientation session and a per-
sonality proﬁle was done on me, I
was set up with Michael, who is
ll-ycars-old, but a little slow. He is
one of five children of a disabled
mother. 1 take him swimming, food
shopping, got him a library card —
I want him to have the things I had
as a kid." said Bccourtcny.

“At ﬁrst i took community ser-
vice bccausc I thought it would look
good on my resume," Becourtcny

Although CSP exists to give
students the opportunity to
volunteer and help in the communi-
ty, it can also give students practical
experience needed to get a job, said
Albany Public Library Television
Media Librarian Robert Katz.

"Students learn T.V. produc-
tion, dark room skills. and how to
write shows here. This station casts
cable and public service shows.

related jobs in ad agencies, the

legislature, filmmaklng, and news
reporting," Katz said.

There is some evidence that com-
munity service programs such as
SUNYA‘s could be instatcd in other
parts of the country. Director
McKinley receives hundreds'of let-
tcr each year like the one Debra
Fink sent in 1978. “Can you please
send any information which may be
helpful in establishing a program
here . . . I am working on my
master's degree at Gallaudct Col-
legc‘ln Washington and I'm anxious
to set up a program like the one i
participated in while at SUNYA
. . . It was one of the most valuable
cxpcricnccs i had as a student."
