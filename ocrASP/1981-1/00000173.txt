One of the most common targets
ol‘truck hijackers itt recent years —
next to liquor and cigarettes — has
been blue jeans.

To discourage ltigltway rob-
bcries. the San Francisco-based
Levi Strauss and Company has beert
shipping its goods in tttttnarked
trailers. Despite this precaution.
ltowever, trailers loaded witlt
“Levi‘s” often have been \vaylaid
artd erttptied ot‘ tlteit cotttertts.

 

So rtow tlte corttpatty has decided
to do a turnabout by converting its
trailers irtto travelling billboards.

The cotttprrrty says it is iii the plo-
cess' ot‘covcring both sides of its I89
trailers witlt 45-inot-long murals cs-
tolling the pluses ol' wearittg partls
witlt the Levi label.

Company officials say the
decorations will be so splaslty and
so easy to spot that highway tltieves
will avoid them — at least that's
what the company tropes will hap-
pert.

breathing patterns

The way you breathe may say a
lot about your personality.

A researcher at the New York
University Medical Center says sltc
ltas found a correlation between a
person's involuntary breathing pat-
terns and his or lter personality
ltaits.

'Sheila Sperbcr Haas claims that

The underground drug market is
— like everything else these days —
being hit by sophisticated deceptive
trade practices.

.Thc International Medical
Tribune Syndicate reports that
“look-alike drugs" are fast becom—
ing a staple of neighborhood drtrg
dealers — particularly of dealers
who sell to children.

According to tire Medical News
Syndicate, established cotttprtnies
are turning ortt legal pills that close-
ly resetttblc sedatives and
“uppers.” The legal pills. however
other almost nothing itt the way ol‘ a
"kick."

Tltc Medical News Syndicate
reports, for example, that one

is tttrrtirtg ottt mild sedatives that
look virtually identical to the
prescription sedative “Qttaahtdc”

Many hard-driving business ex-
ecutives may be "addicted" to their
own adrenalin.

The international Medical
Tribune Syndicate reports that two
professors have discovered that.
some wound-up executives scent to

nature to that produced by unt-

Most Americans apparently
would not find it hard to sleep at
night after cheating on their Income
taxes.

Psychology Today magazine says
a recent survey of American tax-
payers by the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice found that nearly two thirds of
them —- 62 percent to be exact —
said they would have no qualms
about not declaring the value of a
service they traded with someone
else.

What’s more. 53 percent said
they'd feel no guilt about keeping
any major gambling winnings a
secret from Uncle Sam; 49 percent
said that padding business expenses
seemed a reasonable thing to do; 46
percent said they could live with
tltcrnselvcs if they overstated
medical expenses; and 42 percent
said that understating their income
was certainly an alternative they
would consider.

munchlng

Americans no longer put away
three square meals a day: instead,
engage itt what one
psychological researcher is calling
“l'ood contacts" — attd tltcy do so
at least 20 tintcs a day, he say.

Dr. Patti Fine says that on the
basis of interviews with

ltomemttkcrs and records of their
actual food consumption, he lirtds
that Americans continually snack
tlttottghotrl the day.

 

What do they struck on? Fine
reports that tile diet of the
"American mainstream" now con-
sists mainly ol‘, “()reos. peunut but-
ter. Crisco. TV dinners. cake mix.
macaroni arid cheese. l’epsi and
('oke. pizzas, Jell-o. hamburgers.

and beans. Heinz ketchup attd ins-
