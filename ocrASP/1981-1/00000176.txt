Chicago; and Boston-Minnesota.

The Blues have defensive
liabilities in front of All-Star goalie
Mike Luit. But they can score goals.
Bernie chcrko had I04 points.
while Wayne Babych collected 54
goals.

Montreal ﬁnished third overall
and won the Vtaina Cup for the
league's stinglcst goaltending. with
a 2.90 average. Denis Herron who
qualified to have his name inscribed
on the Vezina Trophy by playing in
his 25th game Sunday night. a 4-2
victory over Boston. plus Richard
chigny and Michel Larocquc. trad-
ed to Toronto last month, shared
the trophy.

Wayne Gretzky of Edmonton

then on it was all Esposito and the
Albany attack. Over the last five in-
nings Esposito allowed only one
runner to reach as far as second
base and held Plymouth to only two
base hits.

“Mike pitched beautifully."
Skccl praised. "Front the second in-
ning on he just controlled the
game."

The second game was much
closer. Albany scored twice in the
bottom of the ﬁrst on only one hit
— a hunt single by Arcario. Penny.
the Plymouth hurlcrI couldn’t ﬁnd
his control and walked the ﬁrst two
batters. Arcario bunted to load the
bums. Rosen was safe on a ﬁcldcr's
choice when the shortstop threw
home on his easy grounder. and

Verde walked in the second run.

Plymouth got one run back off
Campbell in the second. Penny
recovered from his initial bout with
wildness and the two settled back
into a pitcher's duel.

Penny retired the Danes in order
in the third and fourth innings, but
they worked out an insurance run in
the ﬁfth. Tortorello walked. stole
second and advanced to third on
Arcario's single. Tortorcllo then
dashed home on Rosen‘s perfectly
executed suicide squeeze.

Campbell pitched beautifully for
Albany, but simply ran out of gas in
the seventh inning. He retired Mark
Migneatio on a routine grounder,
but back-to-back singles was
enough to bring Massaroni in to
protect the two-run lead.

He walked the first batter to load
the bases and when Rivera pulled
his foot off thc~sccond base bag on
an easy double play ball, one run
scored and the tying run came in
moments later on Lee Richard's
sacrifice fly.

Arcario (4-7 on the day) led off
the Dane seventh with a booming
double to deep lcftﬁcld. but Roscn
and Verde grounded out. Fittingly.
it was RiveraI who had made the
crucial error the inning before, to
win it with a clutch single. Less ﬁt-
tingly. it was Massaroni and nor
Campbell who was credited with the
win. "

“I stayed with Kenny Campbell
about an inning longer than i
should have." Skeel admitted.
"But he did a whale of a job. I
thought we had outstanding pit-
ching today.”

The Danes will take their act on
the road tomorrow for n twinbill at
Hartwick and will return home for
a Saturday afternoon doubleheader
versus conference rival Blngham-
