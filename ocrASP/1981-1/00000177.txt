First Dane Loss Of. The Season

by Ken Cantor

On Saturday afternoon. the
Albany State men’s tennis team
took on Concordia in Division in
tennis action. The Danes blew a 4-2
lead going into the doubles com-
petition, and wound up losing to
Concordia 5-4.

"This was a disappointing loss
for us. i really thought we had them
after the singles matches," said
Albany men‘s tennis 'coach Bob
Lewis. it was Albany's first defeat
of the spring season. after two wins
in Florida.

The day started out as a promis-
ing one for Albany. Albany took
four of the six singles matches. in
the first singles slot, Barry Levine
took on Concordia‘s Brazilian scn-
sation Aiitou Borges, who won the
Great Dane Tennis Classic in the
fail. Levine met him head on. and
held a 3-2 lead going into the sixth
game. and the sophomore thought
this was the key game of the match.
However. it was at this point that
Borges took over. Hc started to hit
sortie nice cross court shots to
Levine's backhand, took the next
four games. and won the set. 6-3.
After losing the first game in the sc-
cond set. Levine commented. "I
have to start attacking more." Tltc

two battled back and forth. and
were tied at 5-5 in the eleventh
game. This crucial game was won
by Borges as he hit the winning shot
down the line. in front of the
scrambling Levine. Borges won the
next game. and took the set 7-5.
The second singles match pitted
Albany's Fred Gaber against Cort-
cordia's Mike Hansson, who was
filling in for Concordia‘s regular
number two player. Joc Kreimer.

-another player from Brazil, out

with a groin injury. Each of the
players ranked below Kreimer mov-
ed up to a higher position.
Therefore. Gabcr was facing a
lower ranked player in Hansson.
and handled him easily. 6-2. 6-2.
Gaber hit a lot of nice passing shots
itt gaining this victory.

The remainder of the singles inat-
chcs saw Albany‘s Rob Karen
defeat Concordia‘s Rich Musalo in
the third slot. 6-4. 6-4. Ashley Por-
to defeated Albany's Dave Ulrich.
6-4. 6-1 in fourth singles. in the
fifth spot Albany's Dtn'c Lerner
defeated Concordiu's Ashish
Bhutar, 6-3. 63.

Lerner was excited about his vic-
tory. “i had a much easier time
than I thought i would it:th with
him. He's one of their foreign guys,

and from what i heard, i thought he
was going to be tough to stop. This
was a great incentive for me. [just
went out and did what i had to
do." Lerner said. in the sixth spot,
Albany's Russell Kasow defeated
Concordia's Chris Dudley. 64. 6-2.

The doubles matches brought
about Albany’s downfall. The ﬁrst
doubles match pitted Albany's one-
two combination of Levine and
Gabcr against Concordia's Borges
and Hansson. Albany eased to a 6-1
victory in the first set. Levine and
Gaber looked like a sure thing going
into the second set. However' the
power of Borges started to show in
the second set. and they shredded
Albany up. 6-0. Concordia con-
tinued their domination in the third
set. winning it 6-]. “i‘m really
disappointed." Levine said. “We
had them on the rocks going into
that second set. We just couldn't
hold on."

Albany's second doubles com-
bination of Karen and Ulrich was
defeated by Porto and Krcimer.
who felt well enough to make this
appearance for Concordia. This
fact did not help Albany's cause as
Concordia took the match 6-2, 6-3.

Karen was upset with his team's
performance. “I don‘t know what
happened to us in doubles today.
These guys played well when they
had to. That guy Krcimcr made a
difference in our match." Karen
said.

Albany's third doubles team of

Lerner and Andy Diamond \os‘LJO
Concordla's duo of Musolo and

Bhutztri. 6-0. 6-3. "We didn’t play
very well togctltcr today." Lcrner
said. “Andy (Diamond) didn't play
fifth singles. so he was cold going
into the match. 1 went all out
against Bhutari in singles. We just
didn't have the right momentum for
lllL‘ match. it's too bad because we
have been playing well together in
Florida.”

"Concordia beat us last year 8-].
so i knew we would have a tough
time, ‘ Lewis said. "Those two
iirtt/ilian players. and that one
ltalian guy (Bhutari) are really
tough. However. we hung in with
them. Our singles players did a
great job. especially Kasow and
Lerner. Barry Levine played his
heart out against Borges. However.
we loused up in doubles today.
We're going to have to work on that
part of our game."

The Danes are now 2-] on the
spring schedule. and are 7-2 in com-
bined fail-spring competition. They
play at Hartwick next week.
