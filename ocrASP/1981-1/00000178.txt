ame Tempo ,

Key to NBA Playoffs

(AP) About the only pattern to
emerge from the ﬁrst week of the
helter-skelter National Basketball
Association playoffs is that if a
team expects to win, it had better
control the tempo of the game.

Regular-season records, playoff
experience, home-court advantage.
raw physical talent — all are useless
if a team can't play its game at the
pace it wants.

The prime example is the
Houston Rockets’ upset of the
defending champions, the Los
Angeles Lakers, in their three-game
mini-series.

“We got the Lakers to play our
slowdown game rather than their
running game," said veteran for-
ward Billy Paultz of the Rockets in
explaining how Houston, a
mediocre 4042 team durirtg the
regular season. could oust the
talent-laden Lakers.

"We knew we could win if we
made LA (Los Angeles) play our
tempo," said guard Mike
Dunleavy, whose 18-foot jump shot
with 15 seconds to play put
Houston ahead to stay in Sunday’s
series finale, won by the Rockets
89-86.

“They pltryed their game.“
agreed guard Enrvirr “Magic”
Johnson of Los Angcles, tlte most
valuable player itr last season‘s
championship series but the goal of
the mini-series after shooting a
tnlserable 2-for-14 Sunday and toss-
ing up an air ball from 10 feet in the
closing seconds when a basket could
have won it. “They slowed it down,
made us play half-court basketball
and they won."

So Los Angeles becorttes the 12th
straight NllA clratrrpiotr to fail to
repeat, going back to the 1968-69
Boston Celtics. And Houston takes

Danes Open Season With Two Wins, And a Loss

by Larry Kuhn

A hard hitting Siena squad and
brutal weather conditions proved
too much for the Albany State
baseball team as they fell to the
Chiefs yesterday, 6-4. It was the
Danes' first loss of the season after
sweeping a doubleheader over
Plymouth State on Saturday. Sierra
is now 6-].

Yesterday's game was played irt
near freezing temperatures with a

strong wind blowing out. Siena bat-
ters made good use of the wind,
clobbering two homeruns, but
Albany hitters couldn't harness the
natural source of power.

“Those two pokes were wind
blown and they turned otrt to be the
difference. Their balls had eyes on
them, ours didn't,“ said Albany
baseball coach Rick Skeel.

Albany starting and losing pit-
cher Ron Massaroni ran into trott-

ble early. giving up three runs on
four hits in the first inning with
Siena batting around. Massaroni
was consistently getting. ahead of
the bullets, but just couldn't get
thcnr out.

Massuroni settled down, and
Siena had to make good with solo
runs in the second, third, and fifth
innings. Albany picked up a run in

the third, but when the sixth inning-

rolled around the Danes were down

Stickmen Start Season Off in Winning

by Michael Carmen

After falling behind 3-0 early in
the first period the Albany State
varsity lacrosse learn bottlrccd back
to defeat Plymouth State. 16-8
Saturday.

The Danes, playing against a
newly coached squad did not know
what to expect. After three minutes
of the first period, and trailing 3-0.
llle didn't anticipate a win. But
after the third Plymouth goal the
Danes retaliated quickly and started
pumping in goals.

“Overall we played a good game.
In the third and fourth periods we
scored fottr goals caelt and had cx-
ccllerrt momentum late in the
Same,“ stated Albany lacrosse
coach Mike Motta.

Goalie Ken Tirmnn played
another good game as lte recorded
14 saves, The star of the contest was
Davc Faust. Faust recorded four
goals.

John Nelson also played a rcspee.
“lblc game as he tallied two goals
and added four assists.

"'Our defense and midfielders
Phil/Cd a good game, led by
defensetrran Iiill Watson who did a
“"L‘ Jolt." added Motttr.

Wayne Wruy played a good corr-
tcst as an ttttacltmnn and Mike
Slocum contributed to the offensive
attack with three goals. Ken Daros
shot one tally past the Plymouth
State goalie and assisted on two
other plays,

 

The coach was \cly pleased with
the Danes‘ performance and
thought that the key to the victory
was the squatl's riding alltl clearing
of the ball. “Also important ill the
will," commented Motta, “was our
ability to pick tip lrtorc ground bulls
than Plymouth.“

Last 'I‘Irtrrstlay, Albany opened
the season with a relatively inex-
perienced squad, and defeated
()neonta State, 9-8.

The Danes \verc outplayed for
most of the contest, but in the
beginning of thc fourth quarter they
exploded for three goals in a two
rnirurtc interval.

“We played inadequately defen-
sively and offensively. Only the
spectacular play of our goaltender,
Ken 'l‘irnran, kept us ill the game."
stated Motta.

Tlte team is cotrrirrg off a 7-6
season a year ago and they expect to
at least duplicate that record. Mtrttn
feels that the learn has better basrc
skills tutti is in better physical condi-
tiorl. '

“'I'he squad is very young, wttlr a
lot of frcslrutntr anti sophomores,
bill this should not be a liability,"
evaluated Motto.

The star of the Olreonttr game
and captain of the Danes is Tirnrtur,
a senior and a three year veteran oi

Frank Rivera tried to get
something going with along double
in the left centerﬁeld gap to lead off
the inning. Tom Verde fouled out
to the catcher, but Lou Capozzi's
high pop in front of the plate drop-
ped when the catcher misplayed the
wind blown ball. Rich Cardillo
followed with a long run scoring
single to deep left center, but that
was all the Danes could muster.

They made one last vain attempt
in the seventh. Matt Antalek and
Bob Arcario clubbed back to back
doubles to lead off the inning, and
when Icrry Roscn followed with his
second hit, Siena starter Tom
Shepardsolr, was takett out in favor
of ace reliever Chuck Soltl.

Rivera greeted Sohl with a rtln
scoring sacrifice ﬂy. his seventh
RBI in three games. but Verde
followed with a conrebacker to the
pitcher that had double play written
all trver it. But the Danes got a se-
cond chance when shortstop Jim
Howard couldn‘t handle Solrl's
throw.

But the comeback attempt came
to an abrupt hall when Capoui
jumped on the first pitch and lril an
identical ball back to Solri. This
time they got it right fora game en-
ding dottblc play.

“Siena is a good hitting ballciub--
we have nothing to be ashamed
of," Skeel said. “We didn‘t lay

down and die."

ning run, and overcome a late

Massaroni picked up the win
in relief of Ken Campbell, who had
pitched exceptionally for the ﬁrst
six innings.

Albany excelled in every facet of
the garlic in their winning effort.
Dane hitters stroked 17 hits at a
.327 clip, and scored 14 runs, while
the pitelritrg staff yielded orin two
earned runs (1.29 ERA).

Strategy was also a major factor
— as well as its perfect execution.

the game," said Skeel about his cat-
cher's pcrfcct squeeze bunt in the
fifth inning of the second game.

Del‘ensivcly, Albany was also
superb. They did commit four er-

mine the dominant role of their
defensive performance.
