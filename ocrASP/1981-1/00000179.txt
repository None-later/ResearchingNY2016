SUNY Amendment Debated'

by Susan Mllllgun

Al SASU‘s March 24 rally on the
Capitol to protest the proposed
$150 tuition increase. Assemblymen
Mark Alan Sicgcl, Saul Weprin.
and Albert Vann expressed their
su art of the students’ cause.

News Analysis
“I am gorng to the Hrgltcr Educa-

tion Cpmmittce. the Ways and
Means Committee and the streets of
the city and stand up for low-cost,
broad access higher education."
Sicgel. Chair of the Assembly
Higher Education Committee.
shouted to a cheering crowd.

Yet on April 3 Siege]. chrin.
Vann. and ruost of thc
Dcm0crats in the Assembly voted
against an amendment to the
budget proposed by Republican
John Flanagan allocating over $20
million to SUNY and possibly ot'f—
setting the tuition hikc.

Tltc proposal was tlcf-atcd til-58.

 

 

 

Flanagan is confused and
displeased at the outcome of the
vote.

“it was a party vote." he said.
“l’m not trying to embarrass the
Democrats...(but) Sicgcl runs on a
platform that states ‘1 would never
do this.‘ The real courage would
have been to say at that rally.
‘We're going to raise your tui-
tron."'

Flanagan emphasized that
“students aren‘t recognizing the
fact that the Governor is forcing
them to pay more at a time when a
ton of money is available.“

The Assemblyman claims that the
state is receiving a substantial
amount of extra revenues from
state income and sales taxes this
year — money that could be
allocated to higher education.

Flanagan further said that lie has
discussed the issued with SUNY
Chancellor Wharton and that the
Chancellor agreed he could use a
possible $20 rnilliou dollars ap-

propriated by the legislature to off-
set a tuition increase.

Notably, the amendment states
that the funds “shall not be made
available by the state comptroller
until the Board of Trustees of the
State University of New York shall
have adopted a resolution maintain-
ing for the l98l>82 academic year
the tuition schedule in existence for
the 1980—81 academic year."

Flanagan said “The State Univer-
5in is subsidized now...all we have
to do is increase the subsidy. i had
to fight hard in a conference to get
the (approval of the pmposal).
They should be hard at work tryirtg
to stop (the tuition increase)."

Siegel said tltc defeated amend-
rttcnt implies "a mythical view of
the state's revenue picture.

"The point of the arnendmcnt is
to be embarrassing." he said.

Siech contends that the $20
million is not available.

“We provided $8.5 rttilliott for
SUNY." ltL‘ said. “There is alimit
