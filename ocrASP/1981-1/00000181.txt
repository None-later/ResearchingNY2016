[SUN Y / CLW Y Handle Fiscal ' 'CriSis Differen tly '

by Laura Florentlno

The State's two public university
systems, City University of New
York (CUNY) and State University
of New York (SUNY) are both in
deep ﬁnancial troubles as a result of
Governor Carey’s proposed budget
cuts. However. thc different
methods being used by the leaders
of cacir systcm irr tlicir attctnpt to
resolve their fiscal crisis reﬂects not
only thc politics of Albany, but the
effects of Carey‘s attittrdc toward
public higher education in New
York.

When SUNY Cltatrccllor Clifton
R. Wharton and thc Board of
Truslccs learned that Carey would
cut SUNY'S budget. they decided
on their owtr initiative to raise tui-
tion $150 per student pcr' scmcslcr.
This move drcw criticism not only
front the students and faculty. but
from the State Legislature wircrc
asscrrrblymcn arid senators blasted
them for not first asking for state
funds to restore the budch cuts.

“if the governor’s office will
negotintc with the Board of
Trustccs the SUNY hudch before
we get it, what is tlrc need for the
legislaltrrc‘i’I asked Assemblyman
Arthur Kt'cmcr' (D-Long Bench) tll
SUNY‘s budget hearing last rrronllr.

"Arc the negotiations on the
httdgcl three-party or is the
lcgislattrrc going to bc crrl out? I
litth a feeling the role we have to
play is irtl‘initcsslmal. I don't think
the legislature has been unfair in the
past. For us to have a good working
relationship will! the Board of
Trustees they must think we are
part of the budget process,“ added
Kramer. who is the Chair of the

't‘.

powerful Assembly Ways and
Means committee.

Although this is the first tinre the
Board of Trustees negotiated the
budget with the Governor without
consulting the legislature for money
first. Chancellor Wharton feels this
action was necessary.

“It was the Board of Trustccs'
judgment that the size of the budch
could not be dealt with by the
legislature.“ Wharton said.

However. Wharton added that
even if the legislature wcrc to grant
SUNY additional funds he couldn‘t
guarantcc that money appropriated
by the lcgislatnrc would offset rhc
ltriliorr hikcs.

In contrast to Chancellor Whar-
ton's mcans of obtaining tnorrcy.
whcn CUNY Chancellor Rohcrt
Kibbcc came before Ilrc lcgislativc
hittich committees. he made a
desparntc pica for rnorc funds.

“CUNY has a history of l'r'cc and
low tuition as a Ittallcr of tradi-
tion." said Kihhcc. “The last Iirrrc
wc incr'cascd tuition we lost l1.000
students. We feel that inslcad of
raising luiliotr we should go thc
legislativc route and prcscttt thc
bruich to you rather than hate the
students pay tnor'c."

'l‘lrc CUNY system. which in-
cludes ill collcgcs iocatcd itr Ilrc
New York City area. has an ctu‘oll-
ment of approximatciy 170,000. In
contrast, the SUNY syslcm is rrrtrcir
larger, with 64 univcrsitics and col»
icgcs llrroughotrt thc static and a slu-
dcrrt body ol‘ubout 320.000. CUNY
which was free until 1976. presently
charch $925 for tuition. If thc$150
tuition hike is effected tuition will

. be $1,075. SUNY'S lullion is 5900 u

‘

 

year. With a $150 increase that
figurc will be brought up to $1.050.

ll' CUNY were to raise tuition by
$150. $10.4 million would be
generated. a sum of which only 4.2
million CUNY would be able to
use. according to CUNY student
leader Stevc Solomon. The remain-
ing 6.2 million, explained Solomon.
would go back to students in the

forrn of financial aid tuition
assistancc programs increases
(TAP).

“Titcy‘rc taking out of one

pockct and putting it in another."
Solomon said.

“if thc $150 incrcasc goes
through CUNY will be driving orrl
students who arc likcly to go on
welfare and become unemployed."
Solomon added. “In the long run
the State would hc defeating itself."

For SUNY. lhc ltriliorr hike
would raise sonic $20 million of Ilrc
$50 million operating deficit it
presently faccs trrrdcr lhc governor‘s
hudgct. The State Asscmhly has
recently passed a hudch for SUNY
which would restore $8.4 million of
the governor's cuts. Tlrc Slatc
Scnatc, howctcr. has yet to act on
Iirc budget.

According to SUNY Vice
Chancellor for University Affairs
ioc I’crritr. thc SUNY Board of
Trustees fclt that Iltc legislature
would not conic through with lllt.‘
Iolal $50 trtilliorr needed by April l.
the day llrc new fiscal year begins.
Titus. tlrcy initiated the $150 Itritiorr
hikc with tile governor‘s ol'l'icc of
Management and iiudgcl without
first sucking lhc funds from the
legislature.

Students at the State Universities.
however. heavily criticimd Whar—

ton and the trustees for not acting
in the best intercsts of the student
when they imposed the hike.

“Rather than responding to the
students. faculty. and legislators."
said Strident Association of the
State University (SASU) Vice Presi-
dent of Campus Affairs Bruce
Cronin. “Wharton has cir-
curnvcntcd his constituents to draw
up the SUNY budget."

But Pcrrin argues that “tlrcrc is
no evidence to support the fact that
there is tr lack of cornmittmcnt on
the partrof Chancellor Wharton.
Tire Board of Trustees felt that the
fiscal situation and the April 1
dcadiitrc made it necessary to act
before the legislative budget hear-
itrg."

chcrtlrclcss. others feel the dif-
ferent ways in which the clranccllors
at the two university systems handi<
cd their budgetary prolrlcms has
more to do with the dynamics of the
two chancellor's and their respon-
sivcttcss to their constituents than
with fiscal dcndlincs.

“Chancellor Kihhcc is scrrsitivc
to studcnt nccds. Hc realizes that a
tuition hike would be devastating
for CUNY students." said
Solomon. “Wharton . howcrcr. is
not adequately rcprcscnting SUNY
students. He should havc first
dclcrrnincd if he could obtain the
funds from the legislatrrrc before in»
itiating tltc hike."

“SUNY's chancellor is trot arr
cducator. he‘s 11 businessman," said
Cronin. “His perception of SUNY
is that of a business. CUNY's
chancellor on the other hand is an
educator, dedicated to the future of

higher education." .
Student group“ ohm loci Ihlll pun

sa .

of SUNY and CUNY's ﬁnancial
crisis is a reﬂection of Gov. Carey’s
attitude toward public higher
education.

They point to the fact that Carey
has proposed for SUNY either a
budget cut or a tuition hike or both
during ﬁve of his seven years in of-
fice. In 1975 Carey's first year in of-
ficc and in 1978, reelection year. no
hikes or cuts were proposed. Last
year. Carey requested a budget cut
of$22.7 million but legislators, who
were up for reelection, restored all
the money.

Both CUNY and SUNY leaders
feel a tuition hike at CUNY will
have a nrorc severe affect on
students titan one at SUNY.

According to CUNY director of
University relations Robin Elliot.

arty tuition hike will have a
devastating affect on CUNY
students.

"Thcrc‘s a strong ideological

commitment towards t'rcc tuition at
CUNY." Elliot added. “The same
was never trttc at SUNY because
thcy never had l'rcc tuition."

[Elliot sccs tlrc differences in the
way Ihc two chancellor's are handi-
ing thc fiscal situation as a rcflcc-
tion of the nature of their strident
bodics.

"CUNY tends to fulfill and gear
services towards pcoplc with the
least resources. 110 percent of
CUNY studcnts arc in the low-
middlc income bracket. In contrast.
SUNY students trrc mostly middle
class. They look at tuition as part of
the cost of living. As they see the
price of food going up. so does tui-
tion. The students themselves
would rnlhcr pay rnnrn nut to xauﬁcr

cute." mu Eillm.‘  -  ~~~
