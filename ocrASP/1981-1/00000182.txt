Colleges Debate Creation, Evolution Theories ' '-

(CPS) The renewed debate betwectt
those who advocate the teaching of
evolution as the explanation of life
on earth and those who want to re-
introduce biblical explanations has
ﬁnally spilled over from primary
and secondary schools into college.
Over the last year. a handful of
biology professors — mostly at
small, religious colleges —- have re-
introduced “creationism” into their
curricula. and are now braving the
judgments of the scientiﬁc cortt-
munity.

Professional response to crea-
tionisnt seems to depend on tttc
manner in which it is taugltt. Crea-
tionists tltemsclvcs generally pro.
mote the “two-model" approach to
teacltittg biological developments.

in which creationism is taught along
with evolution, perhaps as a full
unit unto itself.

At the center of the controversy is
the Institute for Creation Reserch,
located at Christian Heritage Col-
lege in California. Its executive
director. Dr. Richard Bliss. calls the
two-model approaelt “good
science” and says it “excites
children about science by letting

them decide questions for
themselves."
Most of the scltools incor-

poratittg the two-ntodel approaclt
are small. western colleges like
Christian Heritage and West Valley
College near San Jose. But recently

Paychecks Held Back Due
to Unfinished State Budget

by Wayne Peereboom

SUNYA faculty and staff did not
receive paychecks this week because
the State Legislature has yet to ap-
prove a budget by the April
dcadlitte.

According to SUNYA Assistant
Vice President and Controller Leo
Nevett. employees received a
"script" in place of a paycheck.
The scripts read “to the effect that
this is not a check, this is a record of
earnings." he said.

The scripts . which will be
distributed in place of paycltecks
until a budget passes. can be casltcd
at a bank. Neven explained.

John Rielly of United University
Professions (UUP). *1 union
representing SUNYA faculty. said
that SUNYA faculty ltas not cont-
plaincd of problems with the
scripts.

Nevett "th

explained. state

budget did ttot pass. so there are no

appropriations for the fiscal year
beginnittg April I." Therefore. he
continued. the state eotttrollcr, who
usually issues paychecks, “has tto
authorization to spend money out
of the treasury.” The money is be-
ing taken frottt Key Banks Ittc.

ratlter titan tltc state treasury.
Nevett said.

Key Bank Vice President of
Marketing Services John Hollister
said the state will not ltavc to pay
interest on the funds taken from
Key Bank.

He explained that a contingency
plan Itad been developed between
the state treasury and Key Bank to
cover situations when a budget is
not passed. Under this plan.
Hollister said. the state Itas funds
deposited in Key Bank to cover
employee checks.

Hollister said this fund has not
been used sittcc I965.

and Michigan State also introduced
a creationism unit into their evolu-
tion courses.

Bliss sees the spread of crea-
tionism to colleges as "inevitable,"
given the number of secondary
school systems that embrace the
theory. According to Bliss. “at least
I8" state legislatures are consider-
ing bills that would require public
schools to teach tltc Genesis ac-
count of crcaiton wltencver evolu-
tiott is taught. The National School
Boards Association puts the
nutttber of legislatures at l5.

Bttt while Bliss says creationism is
"just good science" and wonders
how well-informed scientists could
object to it, Dr. Jack Carter of the
National Association of Biology
Teaclters says his organization has
always been vcltentcntly agianst any
teaching of creationisttt. He adds
that "all the national science
organizations have taken firm
stands in opposition to it," itt-
cluding the National Science
Teachers Association and the Na-
tional Association for Research itt
Scicttcc Teaching.

“From the scientific poittt of
view." Carter contends, “there is
no creationist model for how the
earth evolved. Tlterc is simply no
science to it."

Bliss argues that creationism
picks up where evolution leaves off.
“Evolution leaves too many ques-
tions unanswered." he says. “It
takes far tttorc faith to believe itt
cvoluliott than to believe a creator
did it (made tltc eat'tlt)."

Indeed. bollt evolutionists and
creationists agree that religion is the
greatest point of contention bet-
ween the two sldcs.»Whilc San Fran-
clsco State professor Dean Kenyon
argues tltttt creationism “is not a
rcligiotts theory," his critics res-
pond that any tcaclting based on the
Bible is obviously religious.

Creation "myths" envision “art
external actor who must intervene
at each state," says Larry Smarr,
astronomy professor at the Univer-
sity of Illinois. Scientific theories,
on the other hand, “allow events to
unfold directly from the laws of
physics."

  

Kenyon, himself created con-
troversy when he told his biology
class that the earth was created
20,000 years ago by a “supernatural
creation."

Illinois astronomer Ron Webbink
asserts that Kenyon is directly con-
tradicting what scientists know as
fact. He says that the'earth is ob-
viously more than 20,000 years old.
because, “after all, the light we see
from stars is in itself millions of
years old."

Smart agrees that creationist
theories are out ofsequence and full
of holes. “some creationists don't
even have shreds to surround their
holes." he says. For example. the
Bible states that the seas were form-
ed before llte sun attd that platttsex-
isted before tltcre was suttlighl,
which is itttpossible according to the
idea of photosynthesis.

Bliss deals with suclt criticisms
routinely. He says that cvolutiottlsts
continually resort to calling crea-
tionists religious fanatics.

"Whenever evolutionists try to
debate on tltc basis of science. they
lose, so they have to throw up
smoke screens on tltc basis of
religion." Bliss says. “This is the
only way evolutionists cart exist —
to discredit us attd say nasty things
about us."

But biologist Carter contplaitts
the creationists have a few wily tac-
tics of their own.

"I get calls to debate the evolu-
tiott question. and tlten inevitably
the debate is to be held at sotnc
Baptist prayer or other religious
meeting." Carter recalls. In-
variabiy. the audience is committed
to the Bible‘s teachings before the
debate even begins. and the crest-
Iionlsts point to the audience's en-
tltusiustn as proof that their side
won the debate.

“Of course tltosc things are ter-
rific publicity for tltctn (the crea-
tionists). I just stay away front it,"
Carter says.

Kcnyott wisltes the public would
put aside Iltc religion question and
realize how many beliefs tltc evolu-
tionists and creationists have itt
common. l-Ie says Iltat as ntote
fucttlty realize that creationism is

“‘On over 90 percent of what I
teach, there is no quarrel between
the two groups,” says Kenyon. “In
.fact. the main quarrel is over
macro-evolution, which is the crea-
tion of new life forms.”

“But the idea is to let students see
information for the two contrasting
interpretations so they have a basis
to decide on. I don't tell my
students that either theory is right."

As the debate continues, Bliss
and a core of 20 faculty “work
feverishly" to introduce the two-
modcl approach into school
systems. As a long-range goal. Bliss
hopes that big colleges will
recognize the demand to let poeople
know about creationism.

But of live national sciettce and
education associations questioned.
none agreed that a demand exists.

“Every teacher should, and I
think does. bring in information of
contrasting opittions to his classes,"
suntmcd up Dr. R..l. Vanden-
branden of the National Associa-
tion for Research in Science
Teaching. "But I can't see giving
creationism equal time because
nobody wants it.“
