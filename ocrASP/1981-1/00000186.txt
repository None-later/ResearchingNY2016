Until recently. acupuncture was
believed in this country to belong to the
realm of folklore. fantasy. mysticism.

and even witchcraft. In reality.
however. acupuncture is a traditional
mode of medical treatment in China.
Millions of patients. from personal ex-
periences. can attest to the effect of
needles. properly inserted at specific
locations of the body: the palliation of
certain afflictions. the alleviation of
pain. and In recent years. the medical
usage of acupuncture for anesthesic or
analgesic purposes.

This ancient Chinese healing art has
puzzled many people like myself’ever
since It first began to noticeably surface
In the United States. In an attempt to
overcome this skepticism. I made a visit
to Dr. Jane Pang. one of the very few
acupuncturists presently In the Albany
area.

Dr. Pang greeted me at her office on
Fuller Road in Colonle. She wore a
white lab jacket over her petite five-foot
two-inch frame. Her thick Chinese ac-
cent made it difficult. and somettm’s
impossible to understand. After some
time, though, her speech became easier
to translate.

Dr. Pang arrived here from China on‘
ly eight years ago and has practiced in
the Albany area for the last two. Yet.
being relatively new has not prevented
her from being relatively successful. Dr.
Pang has treated hundreds of patients
between five and 80-plus years old.

Age doesn't make that much of a dtf~

ference in acupuncture. Of course. a
young person may respond quicker to
the treatments than an older person
since the young have a more active
nerve system.

She told me an amazing story about
one of her youngest patients -— a six
year old boy. He had a bad case of
asthma. and frequently made visits to
the hospital emergency room when the
numerous attacks occurred. Four
prescribed medications a day and
several shots a week didn't seem to help
him.

His parents brought him to have
acupuncture treatment as a last resort.
After his fourth treatment he showed
considerable improvement. Today. he
is practically off medication and hasn't
had an attack for months.

I spoke to two patients being treated
at the time of my visit. Both had similar
stories of success with their treatments.

What many people fail to realize.
though. is that acupuncture is not a cure
for any ailment or disease. These cases.
and many like them. illustrate that

acupuncture may be used only for tem-
porary relief of an illness. Patients must
return once this relief subsides. How ef-
fective and long-lasting each treatment
is will vary upon the individual. ﬂ,

nsertion of needles into the skin
! i at strategic points of the body
to treat disease goes back near-
ly 5.000 years in China. though ver-
sions of the art were also practiced by
the ancient Egyptians and others. To
the early Chinese. acupuncture was
thought to supply an almost sure way of
maintaining equilibrium of the body.
which was seen as a sort of energy field.
with lines of force called currents runn-
ing exact routes along a network of
meridians. Along the network. at
specific points were Several hundred
centers that controlled the energy field
— the acupuncture points.

Illness occurred when a person's
energy became unbalanced and there
was too much energy in one part of the
body. with too little in another. What
was needed to overcome sickness and
restore balance —- or so It was thought
—— was to have an acupuncturist insert
needles into these crucial points and
twirl them rapidly. Then. the oversupp-

Brief and

ly of energy from one area would be
shunted to the region of undersupply.
The fact that patients often got better or
lost their pain was good enough
evidence to its practitioners.
Acupuncture has been in the United
States since Chinese workers were im-
ported to build railroads. Even so. it was
not until 1958. after years of medical
and political debate. that China adopted
acupuncture as an anesthetic for major
operations. including brain and ’Iung

surgery in China. although tranquilizers
may be given before surgery to relax the
patient.

Methods of Treatment

he use of needles is a major

part of the treatment pro-

cedure. Through the years the
materials used in the manufacture of
needles has varied.

Today. stainless steel. finewire.
gauge needles are most commonly us-
ed. These needles are sterilized by
autoclave (moist heat) under supervised
conditions.

In some specific conditions added
stimulation is supplied to the needles by
use of an electrical stimulator. I observ-
ed this "sting-ray" effect in Dr. Pang's
office on a patient who needed to
achieve more rapid results due to
chronic. severe pain in his back. This
type of treatment may also be used as
an analgesic or anesthesic during an
operation by constant. intense stimula-
tion of the needles.

Contrary to popular belief. acupunc-
ture does not consist of the sole use of
needles. Moxibustion. another major
technique. involves the treatment of an
acupuncture point by using heat. The
herb used. compacted into the shape of
a cigar. is called moxa (Artemisia
vulgaris).

its application may eltlrer be directly
on the acupuncture point. or indirectly.
through the use of a device that beats
the general area the same way a heating
pad warms the skin. The indirect
method produces no lasting relief unless
combined with needles and/or direct
moxibustion.

Objections to the direct moxa treat-

surgery. Now acupuncture is used to

 

ment center around the fact that it may
become quite hot. for a brief moment.
as it burns down to the skin. At times, a

scab or blister forms on the skin. For

these reasons. many modern practi-
tioners have dropped the use of mox-
lbustion.

Dr. Pang strongly believes that
although the use of needles is more
generally known and accepted. the use
of moxa is just as important. She per»
forms both direct and indirect moxa

  

  
   

treatments on her patients. It has prov»
ed very helpful to her in the rapid
alleviation of certain conditions and ab»
soluter necessary in treating many
specific problems.

In some cases. a type of Chinese
massage is used as part of the acupunc-
ture procedure. This technique. known
as “giver-salt." involves rubbing the skin
with a blunt-edged instrument. This aids
n relieving muscle spasms and in‘
creases local blood supply which acts to
restore normal functioning and flow of
energy to the afflicted area.

The action of “gwa-sah" leaves a red.
rash-like mark on the skin for a period
of three to four days. There is no scarr-
ing or residual pain as a result of this
technique.

Many critics attribute acupuncture's
success to “mind-control" and
“believing in it." Yet. Dr. Pang claims
that very few of her patients were fully
confident and/or convinced about
acupuncture when they first came to see
her. The vast majority of them came as
a “last resort" if other conventional
medical methods did not help. Others
came because they were curious and

An increasing amount of college~

atheletes are turning to acupuncture. It
has been shown to help alleviate pain
for torn ligaments and muscles. muscle
spasms and swollen joints. Many col-
lege coaches now recommend
acupuncture to their players for sports-
related injuries.

Their are hundreds of ailments
acupuncture claims to have success
treating. Recently the World Health
Organization of the United Nations
recommended acupuncture for the
treatment of almost fifty illnesses —
both psychological and physiological.

There are only a few special acupunc-

ture schools in the United States. Dr.
Pang taught for three years at perhaps
the most reknown school here today:
The China Acupuncture Center in
Boston. After attending the school for
one year the graduates must first
become apprentices before entering into
their own practice.

Very few U.S. medical colleges offer
programs in acupuncture. Those that
do usually have very limited facilities for

study.

As Doctor Pang ideally suggests. the
best place to study acupuncture if you're
interested. and can afford it. Is in China.

As a simple. efficient. and. more im-

portant. effective means of medicai~

therapy. acupuncture has successfully
withstood the test of time. scrutiny and
acceptance. To those who remain baffl-
ed by it. acupuncture still deserves a

serious. responsible and objective
evaluation of its merits. Pg;

Does it hurt?

with acupuncture needles may

make you \vonder whether the

Can anyone be pricked like a pin
cushion without feeling pain? I soon
found out for myself. I

At first I was unsure whether Dr.
Pang would comply to “sticking me."
But. she had no objection to my re-
quem.

Dr. I’ang carefully explained that a
needle Would be inserted at the
“Ho-Kit" point located between the
thumb and index finger. This commonly
used point is stimulated to enhance
general health throughout the body. It is
also used to treat headaches.
toothaches. tonsillitis. deafness. eye
ailments. excessive perspiration and

menstrual cramps (to name a few).
With my hand resting palm—down on
the table. a thin sterilized needle is
perpendicularly guided through a small.
hollow metal tube into my alchohol rub~
bed skin. The needle penetrates to a
depth of approximately three-quarters
of an inch. The tube is removed and the
implanted needle is left dangling freely
from my hand.
So far. so good; I feel nothing. The

insertion of the acupuncture needle ‘on-
ly produces a sense of minor pressure
— much less than a hypodermic needle
does.

‘ Dr. Pang immediately takes the
“handle” of the needle between her
thumb and middle finger. and begins to
twirl it rapidly. A tingling feeling spreads
through my hand. After about twenty
seconds. my hand begins to feel heavy.
just as if a five pound weight had been
placed on my knuckles.

She removed the needle soon after-
ward. Only a small spot on my hand
was left by the needle. The area was not
red or irritated in any way. and there
was no bleeding. ’

The strange sensations in my hand
were explained by Dr. Pang as a shifting
of my body energy frotn the hand.
directly stimulating the nerves. I felt no
pain throughout the minor treatment. In

a long treatment of twenty minutes or.

more. slight sensations may persist for
half an hour or so after the needles are
removed.

The actual insertion of needles may
or may not cause pain. The pain
threshold of the patient must be taken
into consideration. I was informed by
Dr. Pang that the more relaxed the pa-
tient is. the less discomfort they will feel.

Finding an _ Acupuncturist

Ileviating pain safely takes
knowledge and skill. In the
wrong hands acupuncture can

cause infection or simply fail to work
and be a waste of your time and money.
Acupuncture evolved in the Far East.
and although most of its skilled practi-
tioners in the United States are of Orien-
tal extraction, this is no guarantee of
reliability. Credentials are more impor—
tant.

Currently. only four states —
Nevada. California. New York. and
Hawaii — license acupuncture as a
seperate healing art. For example. in
Nevada an acupuncturist has to pass a
standardized test approved by the state
government. Eleven other jurisdictions
allow the practice of acupuncture only if
the practitioner is under the supervision

a-of a physician. Acupuncture is permit-
ted in about half the states only if done
by a medical doctor. dentist. chiroprac-

Etor or physician‘s assistant. The other

states vary widely in terms of strictness
ﬂ and enforcement and some ignore the

inisubject entirely.

The American Medical Association

which is

a
O.
‘5 considers acupttncture "an experimen-

tal medical procedure."

 

 

~ «I M.

 

another way of saying organized
medicine is not yet convinced. Similarr
ly. the Bureau of Medical Devices of the
Food and Drug Administration asserts
that the instruments of acupuncture —
stainless steel needles ranging from one
half to four inches long —- are ex-
perimental. and limited to investiga-
tional use in this country. though ver-
sions have been in use for centuries in
the Orient.

Most acupuncture treatments in the

2" ‘\.

    

 

United States are done for muscular
and skeletal pain and disorders. and
mild electric currents are frequently us—
ed along with the needles.

Because of ucupunciure'5_experimené
tal classification. Medicare does not pay
for treatments done with it. The same
generally goes for Blue Cross and Blue
Shield. But many insurance companies
do pay for acupuncture if it is performed
by a licensed medical practitioner and
carried out in accordance with ap-
plicable laws. Some companies —
Metropolitan for one ~ will pay even
when acupuncture is performed by so—
meone else. as long as it's legal and has
been prescribed by a physician.

The average cost of an acupuncture
treatment does not vary too greatly bet-
ween practitioners. Dr.Pang charges
forty dollars for the first visit
(consultation and physical-exam) and
thirty dollars for each following session.
Treatments usually take twenty to forty
five minutes.

'If you have a problem you think
acupuncture might help. your doctor
may be able to refer you to a qualified
professional who practices the art. The
state or local medical society or the
anesthesiology department of pain clinic
in a local hospital might be of help if
acupuncture is practiced in your area.

Most importantly, do not try to ex-
periment on yourself. Taking needles
and implanting them into your skin will
not relieve pain. but will. rather. pro-
duce infections.

The risk of acupuncture is not so
much that a needle will be inserted im-
properly by a practitioner. The real
danger is when the acupuncturist fails to
recognize a serious underlying disease
that acupuncture can’t treat. It may
cause the patient to delay going for a
necessary conventional treatment.’

‘One must make sure to seek competent

medical advice before agreeing to the
procedure. .

'NO'I'E: In an effort to produce
competent practitioners to eliminate this
problem, Chinese medical schools now
require its students to study acupunc-

‘turegas part of their curriculum.
