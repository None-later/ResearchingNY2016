lzen must use ﬁrearms, why not riﬂes? l
ject to the sale of handguns primarily
ause they are conccalablc weapons.

1 do agree with Mr. Wolf that cutting
wn in the black market tradc in illegal
ns is a desirable goal but the existing laws
crning the sale of handguns are totally
dcquate. Handguns should at least be
nscd and registered. if not abolished
gcthcr the way other concealabic
pons such as the switchblndc and hand
rindc have been. “Violcncc bcgcts
cnce." is more than it truism. it is a way
life in America today. but it may be a
of life we can change.

_ c fecl shock and horror after another
“ l of our lenders has been scnscicssly gun-
 down in the Street. We ask ourselves
.: such a thing could happen, how was it
possible. and most of all why isn‘t it
ped? Yet it has happened and it will
 and again. The most tragic thing is
I ,it can happen so easily.

  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 

 

How absurd! What is the purpose of‘a
handgun. To hunt? For sport? They are
manufactured and sold expressly to kill
human beings.

Why don't our legislators do something
about it? Don't they realize that eleven
thousand Americans were killed last year by
handguns? Don't they know that more
Americans were killed by handguns in this
country than in Vietnam between the years
1976-1973?

I've started to write this letter so nlilily
times before. Each time We asked myself.
"What's the use?". and i would Slop. But
we‘ve got to try. This is the only means we
have to lobby, to influence the decision-
rnaking of our society to stop this scnsclcss
killing.

Please write your congressmen. (House
of Representatives, Washington, D.C.
20515) and your senators, (US. Senate.
Washington, D.C. 20510). Please help.

lagara Molittwk Power Co. (NMPC) is
sort: publicly owncrl utility scrving
tale New York. it has more than one
1011 clcclricity cusioiiicrs. Sincu it is n
‘Onopoly in most localities, llic stale
g 'izulutcs it through the Public Scrvicc
Commission (PSC). lec inuny utilities
Niagara Mohawk has dccidcd to build
nuclear power plants. NMPC has two, botlt
located near Oswcgo and they are named
. wine Mile Points Ont: and Two.
. On March 12. the l’SC granted the com-
 uny it 9.2 pcrccnt mic liikc totaling $154
‘1 ; iiliori. This clcctricily rate increase look
feel on March 19. included iii the rate
0051 is 11 provision which will allow the
ompany to collect rcvcrrucs from its
uslomcrs which will be licld and eventually
pent on [curing down Nine Mile Point
nc.
Nuclear Power plants urc useful for
bout thirty years. After that time the
i ! achincry and concrete 1111“: been so boni-
ardcd by radiation that it can crack. The
lant becomes so unsafe that it can no
ongcr 1‘ )cralcd at all. When tiic facility
" cachcs this point it must be sliut down. But
1‘ hen it must be either torn down and
uricd, or scaled up rind guarded. NMPC
t has decided to tear down Nine Mile Point
One. They plan to bury it 111 South
Carolina.
1; So each ycur, from now on. for tire next
twenty or so years, NMPC will be collecting
revenues from the customers so that in the
your 2000 or 2005 when they begin to tear
the plant down. they will have enough
. money to do it. During the current rate yciir
they will collect $2.476 million. Next year it
will be more and it will rise each year.
Nine Mile Point One was first operated in
December. 1969. It cost $200 million to
construct. Before the start up date NMPC
gave no estimates for the cost of dcnroli-
lion. in 1969. they gave an initial estimate
of $6 million. in 19110, the company
cstirrmtcd that if they lrzid to lcirr tlic plztnl
down immediately, it would cost $57
million. NMPC officials stalcd tlrrii 171:1-
wcerr now and 2000 iiil'iutinn would misc
the $57 million to $193 million.

During the rule lrikc barring, a Capital
District Anti Nucicur Aiilnncc (‘oriiiniilcc
(CDANA) nirrdc a motion lict'nt‘c lllL‘ PS(‘.
CDADA coritcndcd that since lllt‘ demoli—
tion cost estimates are rising \‘cry I‘llDlllly

was that the custonrcrs ol' NMI’C would
agree to pay tlic $193 million which NMPC
officials are l‘orcusiiiig and the stockholders
of Niagara Mohawk would pay rill cost over
runs above this 11931111111011.1111.- customers
will pity will“ the compuin is asking for
provided that the company can not risk for
more ill (I Itilcr date.

The Public Scrvicc Commission rejected
the CDANA proposal. The PSC sold the
demolition cost cslirnulcs can bc cxpcctcd
lo clitrngc its the rule of inflation ‘ , -
and its sttfcly regulations are promulgated.
'l'ltc l’SC stated the cost of dcmolitiorr is
beyond the control of the company
stockholders leltl tlici‘cl‘orc the stockholders
can not be held ilL‘CUlllllilblC for future cost
changes. TllL' l’SC finally admitted 111111 the
demolition cost is not known and can not
be known. But they insist that the
customers must pay it till. The stock holders
will not have to pay anything. CDANA
nrgucd 111111 the customers must by pro-
lcctcd against costs which ill'C beyond thcir
control but the l’SC decided to protect the
stockholders.

Tlic PSC iiiis made its final decision but
they have left many questions unanswered.

NMPC's second nuclear power plant will
also have to be torn down some day. Will
the l’SC follow lltc pr'cccdcirt cstublislrcd
now and force the customers to bear the en-
tire demolition cost of Nine Mile Point
Two? How can the l’SC regulate a utility it
it can not hold its stockholders acountnblc
for their own cost estimates? if the PSC can
not hold 11 utility's stockholders accoun-
table, who can? What is the function of the
PSC?

 

How much will it cost to tear clown and
bury Nine Mile Points One and Two? in
lwclvc years the cost cstlmalc for Nine Mile
Point One has risen morc than 3000 percent
—— from $6 million to $57 million to $193
million. During 1980 the cost estimate for
the dcrrrolition of Nitic Milc Point Two was
raised front $14 million to $24 million.

NMl'C's demolition estimates are incon-
sislcnl with catch ollrcr. li' inflation will misc
the cost of demolition for Nine Mile Pnint
One fdrom $57 million in 1980 to $193
million in 2000. how could Nine Milc l’oini
'i'wu be torn down for only $24 million in
2015? Nine Mile Point Two is still undcr
construction. it will not be turned on uiiiii
:rt lcusl 1986. The cuircnl construction
cslintirlc is $2.4 trillion and the demolition
cstiiniilc is OllL' percent of tlic construction
cost. if llic second plant will cost twchc
tiriics us much to construct its the first one
dirt how could it 110 torn down for only one.-

 

. It is almost SA election time again. YOu remember what it was

like in the past. The columns of the podium were cluttered with
many candidates’ posters, each containing promises Of honesty
integrity and diligence. ’

You could not enter the Campus Center without being inun-
dated by compaign workers shoving beautifully Xeroxed flyers in
your'facc. Debates. open forums and phone-in sessions with the
candidates sct_thc stage for competitive elections. Each campaign
worker gave time and effort, and actually believed in the person
they were working for. And despite the fact that many students
looked at these campaigns in amusement, it was important.

At least back then there were people willing to sacrifice their
soctai and academic life to fight for students. They might not
liavc all been the best candidates, but at least students had a
ch0icc at the polls. ' .

But this year is different. You won’t see as many posters. And
only a few workers will be outside campaigning and stopping you
as y0?u rush off to your next class. Where have all the candidates
gone

Nominations for SA president, vice-president, councilpeople
and University Senators are due today by 4 pm. Usually there are
several candidates for each pesition. But as of yet, only one per-
son .has been nominated both for the presidential and vice-
prcsidcntial positions. Even fewer people are running for other
available spots on scnaic and central council. Many council
members have chosen not to run for rc-clcction this year and
non'c oi‘ the current SA members have chosen to run for higher
posttions within the association.

Pcoplc from SA argue that they are there for the students. But
where are they now? Some are indeed graduating, but what about
the ones who are not? is it just because they think that one or two
ycars are enough to put down on their law school applications? is
that wlty tlicy wcrc therein the first place? 11‘ this is true, how can
one argue that SA is for the students?

. it is not our intention to question the competence of those can-
didates who are already running. We‘re glad that someone is still
interested in the students. But in a democratic system, the
populous has the right and need to View, hear and have a choice
among several candidates. They shouldn't be stuck with just a
yes/no vote.
