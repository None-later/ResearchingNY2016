A's 5, Twins I
BLOOMINGTON, Mlnn.(AP)
Oakland ace Mike Norris stopped
Minnesota on six hits as the A’s I
defeated the Twins 5-1 Thursday in
tltc American League opener for the
two clubs. .

A record opening day crowd of
42,658 jammed Metropolitan
Stadium to witness'thc Twins' ﬁnal
season opener at the Met. In 1982.
the Twins are scheduled to move in-
to a new domed stadium in
downtown Minneapolis.

Norris, who won eight of his final
nine games on route to a 22-9 record
a year ago. had a no-hitter going
until Mickey Hatchcr beat out an
infield single itt the bottottt of the
fifth. Hatchcr was erased on a
fielder's choice by Greg Johnston,
but rookie catcher Ray Smith singl-
ed Johnston to second, and
Johnston scoer on a single by
Hoskcn Powell.

Norris. who finished second in
the American League Cy Young
balloting itt I980. gave up two
singles and a walk in the seventh in-
ning, but was able to work out of
trouble. Loser Jerry Koosman held
the A's hitless until two were out in
the fourth inning.

-dlc it, Rivera had a steal of home
and Albany had an insurance run.

The batmcn next meet conference
rival Bittghamton in a Saturday
afternoon twinbill at home at l2:00.
The Colonials boast a good hitting
attack and have some excellent
bascrunners, but pitching will be a
question mark, according to Skcel.

The performance ofAlbany‘s pit—
ching staff Itas been the key to the
team‘s success so far this year. If
they can continue to excel Skeel
thinks he may ltave a winner.

“Our five lop pitclters have got
to continue pitching with the stellar
performances they have been,” he
said. “if they can keep us in the
ballgamc. we can win."
