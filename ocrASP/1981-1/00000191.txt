rve a SUNYA tradition. Due to

Your help is needed to prese .
problems incurred at last year’s Spring Outdoor Show, this
year’s show, Celebration ’81, will have to be run differently.

The major change will be in our ticket policy. The following
changes have been implemented:

  

““v"':'»“.~".'; :— , rte-v.5»: 1.1.; ..:. < r ..

1. You must have a ticket to attend, as the entire

  ' event will be fenced in.

 A 2. You may only purchase tickets w
(Limit is two tickets per tax card.)

3. We encourage you to buy tickets in advance.

4. Ticket prices will be $4.00 for the first tax card
ticket and $6.00 for the second. Tickets on the day
of the show (if available) will be $10.00 with a tax
card. Once again, you must purchase a ticket and
only with a tax card.

5. Proof of age is required.

 

ith a tax card.

 . A major problem last year was safety and cleanup, especial-
; 3‘ ly glass! This year bottles, cans, and related Items such as
  "coolers or kegs, will not be permitted into the event. It is
1 ' essential that you cooperate with this policy.
  There will be twice as many porto-toilets this year. Students
  are encouraged to stay out of the campus center and
 residence halls during that day. The rat and snack bar will be
if; closed all afternoon.
" The entrance to the event will be located behind Dutch
Quad, adjacent to the parking lot.
These changes were implemented in an attempt to preserve
this event for the future. As the event is for University
' . students and their specifically invited guests, it is only with
3‘ , student cooperation that we can expect a successful event.
 Everyone should have good fun and enjoy the day while at

the same time, making these changes successful, preventing
the termination of this great SUNYA tradition.

Thank you,
University Concert Board
