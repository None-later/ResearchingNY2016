This weekend, the AMIA wrll
-host the third annual Albany State

' Challenge Cup floor hockey tour-

nament at University Gym. Seven
teams will compete, including two
Albany all-star squads and either
champion or all-star teams from
Buffalo St., university of Buffalo,
Oneonta, RPI, and Binghamton.

The tournament fortnat will be
similar to that used in the Winter
Olympics — the teams will be plac-
ed intwo divisions and the top two
teams in each bracket will advance
to the playoff round.

The tournament was first held in
1979 and Binghamton beat the
Albany ‘A' squad in the ﬁnals in
overtime. Last year, in a surprise
victory, the Albany ‘3’ team was
victorious in double overtime
against Binghamtont

This season the Albany 'A' squad
is hungry for its ﬁrst title. "We're
gonna win," said Scott Segai. cap-
tain of the ‘A' squad. “The ‘A‘
teamhad the talent to win every
year but just lacked the hustle. This
year we've got the desire and tire
speed to take it all." .

The assistant “captain of the 'A'
squad is defensernan Arl Pressman
of the League I champiort
Stickhandlers.

The goal for the ‘A' team will be
manned by two top-notch net-
minders, Steve Dipressi and Bill
Springer. Dipressi, of the Silver
Bullets. was last year‘s Challenge

Cup' MVP playing. for the ‘3' team.
Spri‘dger. bf the Cheap Shuts. ls

playing in his third Challenge Cup.

The ‘A' defense Is made up of
Segal, Pressman. John Esposito,
Bob Richter, Rich Westerberg and
Pete Welnstock. Esposito, of the I
Stickhandlcrs, is said to be by many
the best defensive player in AMlA.
Richter, of the Werewolves,
possesses a dynamite shot from the
point, and ‘Westerberg and
Weinstock are both veterans \of
Challenge Cup play.

The three forward lines consist of
a lot of scoring punch plus speed
and hustle. The first line are all
members of the Cheap Shots. Larry
Shilling, League I's leading scorer
will center Larry Forte and Paul
Webel. All three played for the 'A'
team last year. On the second line,
Pete Pctrillo of the Werewolves will
be centering Billy Condon and Jeff
Mazin of Los Gringos.

“This will be our speed and bus-
tle line" said goalie Springer.

“We‘re expecting a lot of good
things from the Werewolves in the
tournament. After that final game
we have a lot of making up to do,"
said Segal.

Bob Miller, a veteran of the two
previous tournaments, will center
his teammate Barry Dampf. Botlt
Miller and Dampf were key
tnernbers of the Slickhandlers
championship learn. Dampf had the
hat trick in the final game. Roun-
ding out that line is Steve Robertson
who scored l5 goals for the Cheap

Shots this season.

When the RPI Engineer track
[I] visited Albany State Wednes- Williams and AI Ferguson.
y afternoon, there were a few So. things
ings to consider. First. RPI had
aten the Danes in each of the last
0 seasons by very convincing
rgins. Second. Albany was going
face them without the ser-

ning the dual meet, 85-70.

looked bleak for
Albany. But, these are the “Clutch
Kids" and they came through. win-

“RPI was a little weaker and we
were a little stronger," said Albany

 

State track team head coach Bob
Munsey.

The Danes jumped out to an ear-
ly lead as the 400 meter Relay team
of Mitch Harvard, Steve Decker.
Bill MeCartin, and Eric Newton
clocked a ﬁrst place time of 43.7.
That time bested the old Albany
team record and also was good for a
new track mark.

“It was a good time considering
the windy conditions," Munsey
said. I

Also, Bruce Shapiro and Scott
James shared a first place tie in the
l500 meter event posting a 4:15.4.
At that point, Albany led III-l.

Next. Decker paced the “0 meter
High Hurdles with a 16.3 with Brian
Ragule following him in third place.

But after that event came witat
Munsey called the “shocker” of the
meet. RPI swept all three places in
the 400 meter dash.

“It was a shocker. They zapped
us for nine points.” said Munsey.

That sweep put the Engineers in
front by four points, 28-24. From
that point on, the score swayed
back and forth as the lead changed
hands several times.

Albany got hold of it first.
Harvard won the 100 meter dash in
“.2 seconds. He was followed in
second by Newton's “.8.

To that, Rl’l responded by pull-
ing off a sweep of the Shotput corn-
petition. They regained the lead
38-32.

But, tlterr, James outlcgged team-
mate Jim Roth with a 2:05.6 in the
800 ntetcrs, for a Dane ﬁrst and se-
eortd. That gave a one point lead
back to Albany. Still, Engineer l’IriI
Carlson quickly answered with a
6.28 in the longjump, returning the
lead to RPI. 45-43.

They did not hold it very long as
the score changed hands for good in
the next event. Paul Eielrelbcrger
edged out Carlson in tire 400 Irr—
termediate Hurdles with a 56.5.
ptrtting the Drrrtcs ahead to stay by
one, 49-48.

“He's very good," said
Eicheiberger of his opponent.
Carlson, who has dominated corn-
petitiort irt the past against the
Dttrrcs. “I didn't think I was going
to heal ltirn. iiveryonc said 'yon got
to (lo il' rrnd I did."

“l-Ic fought and clawed to the
last second," Munsey said of
iiichclhergct. “It was his best per-
sonal time."

Recruiting for a Winner

 

iby Bob Bellaflon
' It may be the of f-season for these two Great Dane coaches, but that
,doesn‘t mean that they aren't hard at work planning next year. Figur-
ing out why their teams didn't win more is by far not the only thing
taking up the time of Dick Sauers and Bob Ford. They have been con-
cenrrating a great deal on recruiting V

In order for any athletic team to truly be successful on a competitive
intercollegiate basis, it must try and get the best possible players, and
recruiting them is the best way to do that.

Since the day after a rather disappointing football season ended in
mid-November, Ford and his staff have been diligently making phone
calls around the state, trying to find the right type of players to run the
wishbones artd 4-4’5 of Albany‘s future. Ford anticipates between 40
and 50 new recruits to enter in the fall, but Ire does not really know
who will show up until they do.

But Ford scents to have gotten the best known one — runningback
Brian Niezgodn. In his senior season at Bishop Seully of Amsterdam,
the 5-”, I80 pounder rushed for over 2000 yards, shattered the all-
titrte Section II scoring record with 200 points, first team all'State.

Other top recruits include two defensive standouts from Long
Island — John Redmond and Scott Sanders, who both made second
team all-State.

“But nothing is wrapped up yet," Ford said. "There’s nothing
that's in the bag."

Sauers Itas gotten positive responses from two promising transfers
— forward Jim Stark of Albany Junior College (JCA), and postman
Dennis Fagan of Colgate. both local players. The 6-3 Stark averaged
I5 points per game for JCA. leading them to the first round of the na—
tional junior college tournament. A good shooter, lte will bolster the
Danes on tltc perimeter. He has two years of eligibility left.

Fagan, played one year of junior varsity ball at Colgate before
transfering. can play right away, and has tltree years left. At 6—4,
Sauers calls Irirn a “much similar type postman to (John) Dieckelman.
He's smart underneath." Fagan is a strong offensive rebounder, and
will give the Danes added height on the front line when he teams with
the duo of Dieckelrnan and Joe Jednak, botlt 6-5.

Together. Sauers expects the two transfers to help the varsity right
away. “I tried to recruit both guys out ofhigh school, but they went to
other places," Sauers said.
The third big man Sauers is looking at is 6-6 Jon Berker of Troy
High School, who the coach says has the potential to be a big, plus to
the Danes. "If he can stay here for four years," Sauers predicted,’
“he's going to be a very fine player."

'80 even when the sport is out of season. so to speak, tire Albany
: coaches are still working to bring home a winner.

Eiclrelberger, Pratt. Harvard and
Tony Ferrerti won the Mile Relay

“Everyone ran a good race. Peo-
