Court Threatens Abrams

ROCHESTER. N.Y. (AP) A judge has threatened state
Attorney General Robert Abrams wirlt corrtetnpt ol
court unless lte turns over long-sought grand jury
evidence to lawyers suitrg Iltc slate irr beltalf of 24 Attica
prison employees taken hostage during the bloody I‘)7I
revolt. Judge Robert M. Quiglcy oftltc (‘outt ol' (‘laims
ordered Abrams to turn over grand jury e\|ribits irr-
cluding tape recordings, photographs. videotapes,
movies, artd ballistics and arrtopsy rcports reviewed by
the grand juries. The material has been sought since
I977 by lawyers representing I9 prisott ctttployees who
were taken hostage during tltc five-day revolt and the
families of five other prisott workers who were killed
when the rebellion was put down. The plaintiffs are
seeking $20 rrrilliorr in darrrages, claiming excessive force
was used by ttre state itr regaining control of the prison.
Judge Quigley‘s order , isstrcd last week, directs Abrams
to appear in the Court of Claims at Rochester witlr the
material April 29. But John R. Stewart, ttre assistant at-
torney general who has been handling the case, said
Saturday his office has decided to appeal the order.
Stewart predicted the appeal would not be heard before
fall. Stewart also questioned whether Quigley had tlte
authority to hold an attorrtey getteral in contempt of
court.

Light to be Utilized

Scientists from five SUNY campuses will soorr be
employing a beam of invisible light from the world‘s
strongest man-made light source to better understand
complex physical atrd biological structures.

A new accelerator called the National Synclrrotorr
Light Source (NSl.S) located at Brookhavcn Natiotral
Laboratory is expected to divulge new truths about
structttres at the l'nndartterttal atorrtic level by allowing
scientists to "read" microscopic memory chips which
maybe capable of storing as rttarty as one rnilliott itrptrts
of ittfor matiott each.

The llrookltavcrt research will be administered front
SUNY at Stony Brook and conducted under one of
three US Depttttlltcnl ot‘ I-erergy grants with a funding
potential of $2,475,000 over the nest several years,
I treated 20 rnllcs apart, ltrooklraven and Stony Brook
are institutional neighbors on Long islatttl,

faculty from SllNY campuses will hate trrll reserved
use of one of 44 light beams ttom NSIS, whrclt will be
completed this summer. Research with the powerful ttew
accelerator will permit SUNY scientists to “work with,
