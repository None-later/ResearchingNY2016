Comment A bout Reagan Spurs Campus Furor ‘

AMES, Iowa (CPS) It was, he says,
a remark uttered "in passing."

But the comment, made by tlte
Iowa State University student
government vice president at a
meeting of the campus Union
Board, ltas escalated erazily into a
Secret Service investigation into a
possible tltreat on President Ronald
Reagan’s life, a call for the firing of
two ISU administrators, and a
situation that has "turned the
school's government upside
down."

The farm began at a January 21
meeting of the Memorial Urtion
Board. Student body Vice President
Torn Jackson, trying to illustrate
how easily political loyalties shift,
said, "I may be the presidcnt's sup»
porter today artd ltis assassin
tonight."

A TL‘W people at the rneetirtg
clttrckled, and the tertsiott of tire
debate was tnornetttarily eased, one
witness remembers.

That, ltowever, was the last bit of
humor irt tlte episode. Within one
rnontlt, Jackson was being grilled
first by university administrators
and then by the U.S. Secret Service
about ltis feelings toward Reagan.

Jackson says ltc didn’t know
what the busittess office, which cort-
ductetl a preliminary irtvestigatiort,
was talking about when it called
him on February 17. Jackson asked
David Henry, assistattt to lSU's
president, to solve the mystery.

Hcttry, irt turrt, confessed

__

Jackson’s "case" had already made
it through several levels of universi-
ty bureaucracy. Soon after Jackson
had spoken the infamous words,
associate union director Roger Fer-
ris allegedly reported them to union
director Bruce Hudson. Hudson
then allegedly fed the news to
Henry, who passed it along to earn-
pus security, arid finally the
business office, wltieh contacted
Jackson.

Campus security also reported
the incident to the Secret Service.
Agent Dave Nozncsky says he cort-
dttcted a “routine but serious in-
vestigalion.’I The union board
members he interviewed, Jackson
says. agreed the statement "could
not be construed as a lltrcat against
the president of the United States."

Noznesky asserts that arty state-
rnent "threatening or (implying) to
tltreatcn the president or vice presi—
dent" violates federal law.

The subsequent controversy
peaked tltc same week as the March
30 assassittatiort attempt on I’r'csi-
dcrtt Reagan. It's the second known
Secret Service investigation of
assassination “threats” emanating
from college campuses.

Soon after Reagan's November
election, the Secret Service probed
the origins artd intents til" a
classified ad itt the University of
Massachusetls-Atnhetst stttdertt
newspaper. The ad requested
volunteers for a “hit squad" to at-
tack Reagan, artd was signed “J.

I Ad sponsored by office of student affairs I

Carter." No charges have been filed
In the case.

“Whether the statement is
serious or innocuous is not ours to
decide," Nozncsky says. “All we
are supposed to do is report our fin-
dings to the U.S. Attorney's office,

and it's up to them to determine

guilt."

By the little of the Secret Service
visit, Jackson was worried the inci-
dent could hurt his career. He wants
to go into politics, and fears the ex-
istence of a Secret Service file on
hitn could stop him.

So, after hiring a lawyer from the
Iowa Civil Liberties Union to help
him retrieve ltis file, Jackson charg-
ed Nozncsky with “rttlsconduet”
because of his incrirninatoty ques-
tioning manner.

The Secret Service has since
agreed to return the file to Jackson.
“1 was very lucky that I‘m political.
iy active enough that I knew who to
get Ill totrelt with to stop this
thing," Jackson says. "Otherwise
trty file would be lit Washington
right now."

The "thing" is not exactly stop.
ped yet. Steve Dcl’tossc, studcttt
goverrtrttctrt office manager, says
the affair has “Iuttted Iowa State‘s
govcr urnenl upside dowrt.
liverylrody's cotttplaiuittg about
everyone else."

The student ttttiorr board, for ex»
ample, has accused tltc two union
administrator's wlto allegedly
reported the remark of "acting in
art irresponsible manner." The
university's board of directors has
called a special meeting to review
the adtniuistrutors' conduct.

Jackson says there's u “cumd

chance" tlte board will fire .“ottc or

both“ men. He says he's feudcd
with the two before, and that board
director Ferris “told someone he
has ‘londed ammunition’ for me."

Ferris, on the other hand, is con-
fident his actions were “correct and
legal." He says he has no idea who
reported the remark to presidential
assistant Henry.

“Any one of a number of people
c0uld Itave pushed it (the incident)
through the channels," he says.
"And whoever did obviously knew
the law had been broken. It's not
for tire or anyone else to suppose
that Jackson's statement was a
joke. He didn't say it was at the
time."

, Although agent Noznesky says
Secret Service rules forbid him to
‘discuss individual cases, he does
observe that it is not uncommon for
an incident to be reported “just to
get someone in trouble.” Asked if
that described the Iowa State case,
Nozncsky said, "We’re just not go-
ling to discuss that."

Nozncsky, meanwhile, is still be-
ing investigated by the US. At-
torney's Office for his role in the
case. The Secret Service, Nozncsky
mourns, “always becomes the bad
guy in things like this. We irr-
vestigate as professionally and im-
partially as possible, and then this
happens."
