bars from Beethoven's Fifth Sym-
phony or your favorite Bcatles‘

A Canadian firm has announced
plans to begin marketing a device
called “Tele-tnne“--a little machine
that will convert that incessant ring
into your favorite melodies

 

Tunes tltat reportedly will be
available ittcltrde tltc licatles‘ “You
Say Goodbye. Arid I Say Hello."
arid the theme music front "Star
Wars."

select the sortgs you like by purchas-
itrg different chips. similar to buy-

electric heating

An anatomy professor at Queen‘s
University in Canada reports he has
developed a band-aid containing
clectrodes--a device that not only
keeps cuts cleatt. but speeds up the
ltcaling process.

Dr. Cesar Romero-Sierra says
that his band~aid creates an elec-
tromagnetic l'ield titat passes back
attd forth. through the skirt and
over the wound. The doctor adds
that tests on animals ittdicatc that
the powered band-aid will promote
within 20 minutes the same arnottnt
of scar tissue on the injured skirt
that normally requires one‘or two
days to forrn.

Electromagnetic energy created
by the band-aid reportedly causes
the body to produce a healing pro-
teitt known as "collagen." The
battd~aid is said to be about the
satire si/c arid shape of a normal
band-aid. except that it has two
wires cottrtccted to it.

The elccttic band-aid has bcctt
tested only on animals thus far. but
research on humans is expected to
begitt shortly.

'l'ltal‘s according to Lynn
Ko/lowski. a researcher with the
Addiction Research Foundation in
Toronto. Kmlowski points out that

the levels indicated on cigarette
packages are meant to represent the
average smoker.

However. Kozlowski says that
those average levels are often
trnrcalistic. since they are determin-
ed by governmcttt sponsored smok-
ing machines. Those machines test
cigarettes without adjusting to
changes irt their lengtlts. filters or
burn rates.

The Addiction Research Founda-
liott is now begitinittg studies aimed
at providing smokers with a way of
rnortitoring their personal intake of
ar and nicotine--assuming they
.‘are. that is.

paraquat poisoning

A House Subcommittee has ap-
proved a controversial bill that
would enable tltc U.S. (‘rovcrnmcnt
to finance the spraying of the her—
bicidc paraquat on marijuana fields
in the nation of Colombia.

By an R-to-t) vote. the House
Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific
Affairs voted this to repeal the so«
called “percy tilticlttlltit‘tll"null
amendment adopted nearly three
years ago. The pcrcy amendment
cut off all LLS. support for tire
spraying of the poisonous het-
bicides on tnarijttatta I'icltls abroad.
The atttcttdmcttt was adopted after
FL'LlL‘I‘ttl licalth Ot'icials concluded
that contaminated marijuana comv
ing irt from Mexico posed a serious
health ltrt/ard to Atncricau pot
smokers.

lt' tltc new parnquat bill is ap-
proved by the full congress. it
means the United States could begin
supplying Colombia with
helicopters. spraying equipment.
arid herbicides to he used against
Colombian tnarijuana fields.

The National ()tgani/ation for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws calls

I .
 it
t E

 

the proposal--in NORML's words--
"a program to poison marijuana
smokers."

 

The proponents of the new para-
quat spraying program say they
don't yet know how much the pro-
gram might cost; but NORML says
its own studies indicate that a full-
scale program in Colombia would
cost the US. taxpayers about $250
million.

Democratic rcpresentatis'e An»
drew .lrcland of Florida insists the
new parnqttal program is needed
because, Ireland claims. organi/ed
crime ltas been taking over the
marijuana market. lreland also says
that tile widespread use of pot in the
United States is "breaking up the
family."

N()RMI.'s (icorgc Filt‘ttlttltlt.
however. counters ltcland by say-
ing: "To begin a program in (‘ol-
otnbia when the suspected health
consequences are well known itt ad»
vancc cant be construed as nothing
less than a tlclibtatc attempt to
poison the nation‘s 30 million ttrar i-
jtnrmt consumers."

Psychology reports that 72 students
of both sexes at the Catholic
University of America were asked
to evaluate counselors. many of
whom used profanity.

The Journal says that male
:ounsclors who used four-letter
words were rated as less effective
than their female counterparts who
used similar language. it was also
found that physically attractive
counselors were criticized for their .
swearing just as mtrclt as were their
less-attractive peers. a cdnclusion
which refuted previous ﬁndings.

longevity

The American Medical Associa-
tion says that a life expectancy of
too years--or even more-~sccms to
be just around the corner.

The A.M.A. predicts, in fact,
that today’s average fifth grade stu-
dent will probably live long enough
to see his or ltcr great-grandchildren
in the fifth grade.

 

ttt Wits. when Social Security
first went irtto effect. the life expec-
tancy itt the United States was 6]
years. Life expectancy today is 74
ycats. or 13 years longer.

The A.M.A. says that medical
advances. expanding health
-knn\vlctlr-c. and better litiug stan-
dards are all contributing to an
"aging. revolution." it‘ll continues.
the group says. many babies
delivered during the decade of the
l980‘s may still be alive irt the 22nd
celttttty.

A Republican congressman from
Ohio says lie was astounded to learn
that the Library of Congress is
spending “00,000 a year to pro-
duce Plttr'lmy magazine in braille
attd distribute it free to the blind.

Representative Chalmers Wylie
insists that-Ain his words--"Therc
rnttst be many other more
justifiable and deserving uses of
laxpaycrs" money than to promote
the sale ol‘...a sex-oriented
magnrine.”

However. Librarian of Congress.
Daniel Boorstin. defends the corr-
versiort of Playboy articles into
braille. stating that the articles are
“chosen for their literacy merit and
their potential and expressed in-
terest to our readers." I

Boorstin notes that many blind
readers apparently are anxious to
get their hands on Playboy. He told
representative Wylie in a letter that
"of the more than 30 magazines
available in braille form. Playboy is
one of the most popular items.
