down in the years of the big budget
cuts. In i975, 1976. and 1977." said
Frederick Volkwcin, Assistant to
the President.

“We had to swallow. in the space
of two to three years. over 200 posi-
tion cuts university wide." Volk-
wcirr said. “A lot were mandated
externally. by the Governor's pro-
posal. Tlrcy designated iiow funds
should be allocated. Wc rctrcncitcd
it lot of programs."

Volkwcin maintained that advise-
rrrcnt has not consistently
deteriorated since the years of the
budget cuts. but since I975 "there
has been much more student con-
cern. In I978 we started doing
something about it," he said.

As the '79 committee report
states. "There are among the facul-
ly. staff. and students diffcring
perceptions about virtually every
aspect of advisement. the nature of
its problems. and the most effective
means for improvement."
