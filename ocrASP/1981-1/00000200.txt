Women Ne tters Dominate Strong Bingham tan

Unfortunately, Ducltin's match
against Binghamton proved to be a
bit different frorii practice. Though
site kept the ball in play. for three
lengthy hours at that, and ex-
pcriertced sortie long rallies, Ducliin
lost the first and third sets of the
tnatclt 7-5, 6-]. Her second set ef-
fort was good crlouglt for a 7-6 will
arresting play with a 7-3 tiebreaker.

Fourth and fifth singles players.
freshman .loalt Phillips and junior
Ariite Newman, respectively. both
won their individual contests.
Phillips outplayed her opponent
6-3. 6-2 and Newman worked for
her 7-6, 6-4 triumph. "Last year
Anne was number two singles,"
reflected Mann. "I Iliitik that shows
the improvement of the learn."

Seeing doubles action for Albany
was the first duo of junior Karen
()‘Conner and freshman Latitett
lsaa‘cs, and the second pair,
sophomores Sandra liorrelle and

Amy Feinbcrg.

A strong Bingliamlon team put
down O'Conner and lsaacs, 6-0.
6-2, but Borrelle and Fcinbcrg, who
have never played together until
Saturday, defeated their opponents,
6-2, 7-6, scoring 7-3 in the second
set tic breaker. “Amy has mastered
a tiew serve," revealed Mann, “and
played well together with Sandra."

Absent from the field of competi-
tion was Albany captain Sue Bard,
who is recuperating froin it pulled
shotildcr and neck muscle. It's
doubtful that she‘ll play in tomor-
row‘s event against West Point.
Looking forward to when she can
play she admits, "()ur learn will
play sortie tough learns this spring
— otrr record will not reflect as well
as we play." Included among those
tough learns are Concordia, West
Point and Division I St. .Iohn's.
