Ruggers Cop Second i

by Bob Bell-[lore

The Albany State rugby club, set back by two nullified scores in the
championship game, placed second in the Third Annual Sicna College
Rugby Tournament Saturday in Scltncctady, as they lost to the host
team, 14-6. Siena's winning score came on a long run in the game’s
ﬁnal minute.

Albany got to the ﬁnals by beating tlte ‘3' team front West Point,
20-0 in the ﬁrst round of the eight team tourney. and then thrashing
Siena’s number two squad, 64-0 in the semis.

But the ruggers ran into some disputablc officiating and the
rigors of playing three games in otte day, and dropped to the Chiefs.

“The momentum we had goirtg ittto the ﬁnals didn't carry in the
finals," said Albany eo-captain Jimmy Johnson. “After our first
score was called back, it seemed to die out. Johnson said tlte tide took
the full turn once Albany's second score (in rugby, it is called a try)
was discounted.

'Albany’s score came on a run by Bill Stoekweli, who is the Danes'
leading scorer so far this season.

“It was pretty close up to the end," Johnson said.

Getting to the ﬁnals, Albany did not know the nteaning ol' the word
close. In beating Army, Johnson said tltat tlte Dane ruggers played orte
of their best games of the year. Attd against Siena's ‘8‘ team. Albarty
had no trouble.

“We just dominated clearly irt every aspect of tire garlic.“ said
Johnson.

Conditioning may have been a ptoblern, as tlte entire toutttarnent
was played in one day. “it was out first tournament," Johnson ex-
plained, “and we weren't really ready to play tItree games itt otte titty."

The Albany ‘8' team captured fourth place by losing to Union, 9-6
in the first round, beating RPl, 6-4 in the second. and failing to Atrtty
in the third place contest, 12-6.

 

"We'll probably be there again next year ."

“The tournament was great--wei| organized," continued .loitttsott.

Batmen Win Three; New 7 -1

continued from back page

the initial Albany outburst in the
ﬁrst inning. The Danes sent 12 men
to the plate and collected eight runs
on five hits. four walks, a hit
batsmen, and five stolen bases ——
three by Tortorello. The big
hits in the rally were a three-run
double by Rivera. a 'two run
double by Lynch, and an RBI
triple by Antalek. Designated
hitter Bobby Rhodes also con-
tributed a run scoring single and a
stolen base.

Albany added another run in the
second, but Skeel started
substituting in tire fourth and fiftit
innings to give his bench some ex-
perlcnce.

in the second game Massaroni
pitched an inspired ballgame for
four innings. The sophomore
retired the ﬁrst 10 batters lte faced
and allowed just one unearned run.

While Massaroni coasted, the
Dane offense was mounting a 5-1
advantage with a power hitting
display. Rowlands started the
fireworks in the second inning with
a two-run home run on a blast to
straight away left field. Rowlands
hit the ball hard all day, but had to
hit it out of tlte park to get one to

drop for him.

The Danes added two more runs
in the third without the benefit of a
hit on two errors, two walks. three
stolen bases and a wild pitch. Then,
in the fourth inning. Tortorello
crashed one of two identical homers
to left ﬁeld. ‘

1n the top of the fifth, Massaront
ran into trouble. The young pitcher
gave up five singles and three runs,
and only Tom Verdc’s perfect peg
from right field to cut down a
baserunner at home averted
disaster, as the Albany lead was
trimmed to one.

“It looked like we were going to
blow them out again and we played
a little iackadaisical," adtnitted
Skeel.

But Albany got tough again and
added insurance runs in the fifth
and sixth innings. Tony Moschella
delivered a clutclt single to drive irt
designated runner Steve Shucker irt
the fifth with two outs and Tor-
torello connected for his second
home run in the sixth.

Massaroni held the Colonials to a
run in the seventh to nail down the
victory.

“I think people have got to
respect our home run power,"

Skeel said. "Bob Tortorello's two
home runs were the difference."

The Danes have been tearing up
opposing pitching. batting .324 as a
team. Arcario is the team's leading
hitter, batting at a torrid .532 clip,
and Antalek follows him at .400.
The double play combination of
Rivera and Tortorello add speed
and punch to the line-up with
Rivera hitting .391 with a team
leading 13 RBi's arid Tortorello hit-
ting .348 and contributing 11 stolen
bases. As a team Albany has stolen
40 bases witltout being nabbed
once.

Tltc balrnen rtext take on RPI on
Tltursday afternoon at RPI. Skcci
feels that thc‘red hot Danes cart beat
them, noting that they are strong
defensively, but he said. “I feel we
are a better ball club."

N. Y. Rangers Are Ready

After Eliminating Kings

NEW YORK. N.Y. (Al?) Just a
month ago, the New York Rangers
were wondering itow they could
manage to get ittto the NHl.
playoffs. Now. they're thinking
about ltow far they cart go.

After eliminating the Los Attgeles
Kings three games to one irt the
best-of-fivc preliminary rourtd, the
Rangers say they are ready for
anything. And anyone.

"We had to play No. 4," said
rookie defensematt Torn Laidlaw,
whose third-period goal was tlte
winner in Game 4. the series clin-
ehcr, “so it doesn't matter who is
next. Our bricks were to tire wall all
the time irt the season and we had to
work hard all the tinte.

“We pttt it all together down the
strcteit and can go as far as we
want."

Few people expected the Rangers
to go past the opening round, wlticlt
they won by outscorng the Kings

23-12 and continuously pressuring
the suspect Los Angelcs defense,
which yielded loads of breakaways
and close-range shots on goaltender
Mario Lessard.

“There‘s rtpt that much dif-
ferertce between the fourth team
arid the 13th." said New York
center Uif Nilsson, who had five
goals irt the series. “Hockey is a
game or capitalizing on the other
team's mistakes because it‘s hard to
create plays.

“i believe it all starts irt ottr own
end with a good defensive system.
11' you have that. you‘ll be all
right."

The Rangers made a good of-
l‘cttsc stand for a good defense by
controlling the prick and the pace of
each game. They got scoring from
all four lines and their defensetnen,
anti Steve linker was solid itt goal.

Perhaps the best performer on
the Rangers against Los Angelcs

Albany Student Press

was Ron Duguay, who was injured
for much of the regular season,
then was sitifted from .wing to
center in the final montlt of the
campaign. Duguay had five goals
against the Kings attd missed on
several breakaway opportunities
against Lessard.

“1 get tnyself so psyched in the
playoffs," said Duguay. who will
become a free agent following the
playoffs. “No one retnentbcrs the
rest of the seasott. | play best under
pressure.

"1 think we cart go all the way."
added the speedy forward who
started and ended the Rattgers’
scoring itt the 6-3 triutnplt that clin-
cited the series Sunday. “We even
have a better team than when we
got irtto the finals ttvo years ago,"

The Kings were crushed by their
fourth consectttive first-round
playoff exit.

“One of these days we'll get
lucky and go all the way.“ sttiti
Kings- owner .lerry Iluss. “llockcy
has a big future on the West Coast.
If we show some improvement nevi
year, we‘ll ttrttt it all around.“

Joe Louis Dead at 6‘6; 
‘More Titan Sports Legend

LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) Joe Louis
never needed an introduction when
he attended a ﬁght here; the crowd
always sensed his arrival. And he
always received two standing
ovations--the first when he was
wheeled to his ringside space; the
other when his presence was for-
ntally announced.

The thunderous, drawn-out ap-
plause Louis received when he
showed up for one of the frequent
fights in this boxing capital, the
thousands of photographs he posed
for with lesser luminaries, attest to
the esteem in which lie was held.

Last Saturday night was no dif-
ferent. As Louis was wheeled irtto
the sports pavilion at Caesars
Palace prior to the Larry Holmes-
Trevcr BL‘i‘i‘liL‘k heavyweight tillc
fight. the crowd began to stand up.
straining to see. The spontaneous
applause spread tttttil more titan
4,000 people were on their feet,

clapping, whistling and cheering for
the former heavyweight champion.
Later, between ﬁghts, Louis was
announced from the ring and the

' ovation rose anew.

'Fourteen hours later, the Brown
Bomber was dead.

Louis, 66. was stricken at his
home Sunday and died of cardiac
arrest at a hospital shortly after-
wards.

Funeral arrangements were pen-
ding.

"He was a wonderful man, a
great figltter and he fougltt to the
end," said Louis' wife Martha.
“He's been sick for a long time and
never complained. He enjoyed peo-
ple and he enjoyed his kids. but
death is fittal and what else can you
say?"

The White House issued a state-
tuertt itt President Reagan's name
eulogising Louis as "more titan a
sports legend."
