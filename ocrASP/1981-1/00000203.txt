Danes Sweep Bingh‘amton, Come From
Behind To Top Union; Record 7-1

by Larry Kuhn .

It has been a long time since win-
ning baseball has come to Albany,
but the drought may be over. This
spring's version of the Danes have
jumped to a 7-] start after a come-
from-behind victory over Union
yesterday afternoon and a twin-bill
sweep of conference rival Bingham-
ton on Saturday.

Albany State baseball conch Rick
Skeel thinks his Danes are for real.

“We’re playing decent baseball
and we’re not even playing our best
yet." said Skccl. “I don't think this
quick start is anything deceiving."

Albany convinced a lot of people
that tltey were for real in their vic-
tory over Union when tlley fell
behind the Dutchmen 6-0 in the sc-

cond inning. but fought back to
win, ll-6. behind a pllenomenal
relief appearance by Mike Gart-
man.

Dane starter Jim Vaughn got

knocked out of the box in the sc-
cond inning when he gave up six
runs on four hits and live walks.
but Oartman slammed the door. He
got behind the ﬁrst batter he faced
with three ha“: and no “ﬂicks and
the bases loaded, btlt came back to
strike him out to end the rally. It
was smooth sailing from there otl ill
as the big right-hander held Union
to one hit, a double ill the ninth, the
rest of the way.

“Mike did a beautiful job,"

Skcel praised. “He was poised, he
was collected and he was always
around the plate."

“It was a superb performance."
added Dane catcher .lerry Rosen.
“His curve was really working
great."

Garttnall was more modest. “We
were down six-zip — yott have to
give all the credit to the hitters. Our
hitters have really been ltittillg the
heck out of the ball," he said, but
added, “that was the best game I
ever pitched."

Tllc Albany offense started ttl
chip away at tile Union lead inl-
mediately. scoring tllree runs ill the
bottom of "the second. Bruce
Rowlands clouted his second two-
run home run in as many games to
start tlle attack and Bob Arcario
singled in Bob Torttlrcllo with tile
third run of the inning.

Tllc Danes then wiped out tltc
Union advantage with four rtllts ill
the tllird. Frank Rivera and
Rowlands walked, advanced on all
infield otlt alld then scored on Jim
Lynch's single just beyond the
shortstop‘s grasp. Tortorello walk-
ed, and he and Lynch raced home
on Mtlll Anttllck‘s two-hugger
dowtl the left field line.

That was all (ttlrtlllan necdcd.
btlt Albany added one rlln ill the
sixth and three ill the seventh to nail
down the victory.

"I'm very proud of them.“ Skccl

said. "No way in my wildest dreams
did i think we were going to come
back that fast. They're all winners
— they're lighters."

Skeet knew that the Binghamton
pitching staff was suspect before
Saturday‘s double-header sweep.
btlt he never could have anticipated
the thrashing his hitters would give
the Colonial llurlcrs.

Albany scored eight runs in the
first inning of the opener, seven
before a man was out, and
Bingllamton never rceovcrcd.~skcel
went to his betlch early in that
game, which Albany won, ll-3.
The Danes added the nightcap. 7-5.

Mike Esposito and Ron
Massaronl cacll Went the distance
for Albany in picking tlp their se-
cotld wins of the spring season.
Esposito. a scllior, notcllcd his
scvcntll victory of the year (5-2 ill
the fall) which tics an Albany
record held by Pat Quinn, who ae-
conlplisllcd the feat ill the l973-74
season. Esposito has given tip only
to hits in I4 innings this spring and
boasts a 1.29 ERA.

He kept Colonial bats ill clleck
for the ﬁrst five innings, allowing
only five runners to reach base
before giving tlp tl lilt'ccsrltti homer
to clean-up lltlttcr Harry Caruso in
the sixth.

But the Dane lturlcr‘s perfor-
mance was almost overshadowed by

of l20—43.

“We knew they were going to be
weak. It gave us a chance to rest ll
few people who needed it." said
Albany State track and field head
coach Itoll Mlltlscy.

Again. the Danes opened tip in
strong fashion as Robertson look a
first place ill tllc 10,000 ttletcr event
with a little of 33:29.5. That little
was good for one of tile three track

A second track record, which
also llappcltcd to he a new teatll
record was set by James in the 800
nlcter event. He clocked a 1:565
and was imincdiately followed by
Tony Fcrl'ctti ill second place.

“it was very good," said
Munsey. ".llttrles took a lead alld

just built tip on it."

The filial track record of the day
was turned ill by senior

nant of late ill the 400 meter ill-
tcrtncdiatc hurdles. He ran a 55.7
