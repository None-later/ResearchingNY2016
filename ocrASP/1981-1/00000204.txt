SA Presidential Endorsement

Dave Pologe — strong leadership .

Although Dave Pologe is the sole presidential
candidate, the ASP has elected to endorse him.
We feel' that Dave will be a strong and
dedicated SA president and deserves our full
support.

Pologe did not just step into the candidacy
because he was assured of little or no opposi-
tion. His ideas reflect considerable thought and
a sense of priorities regarding the issues ~ par—
ticular academics — that affect students on this
campus. Considering the rushed passage of
distribution requirements and the lack of
debate and student input itt this area, Pologe is
wise to direct his efforts towards improving
academics. Another major concern of his is en-
suring that strident groups are allowed to
develop attd serve the tnany and diverse student
interests at SUNYA.

We are confident that Pologe will bring to
the presidential position the benefits of his ex-
tensive experience as UAS president and as a
university senator. Pologe is a productive and
‘apable administrator and eo-workcr — proven
by his handling of the Barnes and Noble con-
tract while he was UAS President and a
member of the comtnittec that researched col-
lege bookstores.

Pologe will be an effective leader partly.

because he is not hesitant to take definite stands
on student issues, such as the SA funding of

Albany Student Press

student advocacy groups, and partly because he
is so well—liked. He has encouraged student in-
volvement on the UAS Board of Directors, and
his rapport with his eo-workcrs will certainly
draw students into SA. Pologe has recommend-
ed taking Central Cpuncil meetings into the
quads so students will be greater exposed to SA.
The key to encouraging student participation in
SA, Pologe feels, is not persuading students to

'join, but keeping them involved.

We also liked Pologe’s attitude'about dealing
with problems relating to the administration.
He has dealt with the SUNYA administration
often in the past and is not intimidated by
them. With student support, Pologe won’t back
down. Yet, he is not abrasive, and his
reasonable, common-sense approach will leave
administration more open to negotiation.
Pologe also pledges to keep students more in-
formed on his dealings with administration in—
stead of springing final decisions upon the stu»
dent body without their input.

Students may only have one choice for SA

. president this year, but we feel Pologe is a wor-

thwhile one. He offers to SA the experience,
leadership qualities, and loyalty to his consti-
tuency that organization badly needs. Pologe
\von‘t comprotnisc himself or the interests of
the students. SA needs a strong yet accessible
leader — and Pologe promises to be just that.

r Vice-Presidential Assessments j

Stephen Minter

Stephen Minter is one of the
tnore experienced vice-
presidential candidates. He is an
active metnber of the Kappa
Alpha Psi fraternity and a two-
year member of Central Coun-
cil. The endorsement committee
commends Steve for his involve-
ment, bttt feels he is not lully
acquainted with catnpus groups
or student issues to adequately
fulfill the viee~presidential role.

As a member of Central
Council, Steve has worked ex-
tensiver with the Minorities

Task Force in drawing up an
Affirmative Action policy. The
committee believes that he is
knowledgeable of minority con-
cerns and, if elected, will work
hard at representing these views
as well as all students’ points of
view.

Steve stated —— as did all of
the other candidates — that he
feels his job is to represent the
students, as opposed to the ad-
ministration. He is willing to go
all the way to serve student
needs. The committee was
disappointed, howwer, that
Steve offered no new strategies
to accomplish this.

The committee was also

SA Vice-Presidential Endorsement

 

 

Woody Popper — a thinker

Woody Popper has, he admits, little ex-
perience in student government. Yet his
awareness of student issues, open-mindcdness,
and willingness to give all of himself to the vice»
presidential position convinced the ASP to en-
dorsc him —— with some reservations — for the
SA vice—presidential scat.

Most of the candidates bemoaned the “SA
clique," and several less experienced candidates
argued the “fresh blood" theory in defense of
their campaigns. But it was Woody whom we
felt could effectively bring accessibility and
organization to SA despite his lack of former
association with it.

Woody's a thinker. He claims — and We
believe he possesses — an ability to see both
sides of an issue. He thinks before he speaks,
analyzes before he acts. Hc advocates talking,
protest, and on occasion, compromise when it
comes to dealing with the administration. He's
willing to fund campus advocacy groups. in-
terest providing, regardless of that group’s
beliefs. He draws the line at those organizations
with “unethical” motives — citing a neo-Nazi
group as a potential example —— but favors risk-
ing the “borderline” eases.

Woody’s not an initiator. He offers no eon«
crete solutions or new ideas. He sees his role as
vice-president primarily that of a project coor-
dinator, secondary to and supportive of the SA
president. Yet we consider a consistent, hard-

working, organized, clear-thinking vice-
president more beneficial than one with a lot of
ideas that never materialize.

Not that Woody doesn't have pet concerns —
he's. particularly disturbed by the lack of stu-

dent input and advisement in the drayving up of
diatribuuon . requlrcment‘ n‘rheﬂtﬁt' hAvhﬁt.

himself worked on a peer-advisement board.
Woody plans to obtain student voice in next
year's distribution requirement breakdown.
He's also concerned about the rising cost of
education, the cost and safety of off-campus
housing, and the failure of the university to
provide “due process" in clearing records holds
—— an issue no other candidate examined.

We were also impressed by Woody's straight-
forwardncss. He didn’t claim to have all the
answers, he didn’t promise to reverse student
apathy, nor did he claim an ability to eradicate
communication problems between SA and the
students. He's not a politician, he’s not an op-
portunist. He’s just an honest, hard-working
member of the student body who’d like a shot
at working through SA to serve its organiza-
tional and outreach purposes.

Woody won’t leave the vice-presidential posi-
tion with a lot of creative, innovative projects
to his credit. But we feel the complement of a
dynamic president such as DaVe Pologe and a
supportive, dedicated vice-president like
Woody is this year's tnost effective team
choice.

pleased to learn that Steve is
concerned with athletics on
campus. He was the only can-
didate to point out that SUNYA
received only 50 percent of the
funds mandated by the state for
athletics. We believe that Steve,
if elected, would push for this
money and direct it towards
projects such as rejuvenating all
athletic facilities, lighting the
fields, and bulldiitg a field
hottsc. Steve noted, however,
that an issue such as building a
field house is one that requires
student input through a referen-
dutn.

Steve favors funding
“political” groups which are
oriented towards education. Yet
he does not believe it is the pur-

pose of SA to sponsor groups
which advocate a particular
position. Groups such as the
Peace Project and Unin
magazine, Minter believes,
should receive funding because
they do not “advocate” but
serve to cdttcatc students. He
remarked, however, that there
is a fine line between the in-

structional and the political.
Our biggest reservation with
endorsing Steve was that we feel
his support of a voluntary stu-
dent tax is unrealistic. Ideally,
his philosophy is sound; those
who support student govern-
ment and are involved should
pay, while those who do not
wish to pay —- should not.
