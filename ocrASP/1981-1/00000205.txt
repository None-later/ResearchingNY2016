Your help is needed to preserve a SUNYA tradition. Due to
problems incurred at last year’s Spring Outdoor Show, this
year’s show, Celebration ’81, will have to be run differently.
The major change will be in our ticket policy. The following
changes have been implemented:

1. You must have a ticket to attend, as the entire

event will be fenced in.

2. You may only purchase tickets with a tax card.
(Limit is two tickets per tax card.)

3. We encourage you to buy tickets in advance.

4. Ticket prices will be $4.00 for the first tax card
ticket and $6.00 for the second. Tickets on the day
of the show (if available) will be $10.00 with a tax
card. Once again, you must purchase a ticket and

only with a tax card.

5. Proof of age is required.

  last year was safety and cleanup, especial-
ly glass! This year bottles, cans, and related items such as

coolers or kegs, will not be permitted into the event. it is
essential that you cooperate with this policy.

There will be twice as many porto-toilets this year. Students
are encouraged to stay out of the campus center and
residence halls during that day. The rat and snack bar will be

closed all afternoon.

The entrance to the event will be located behind Dutc

Quad, adjacent to the parking lot. '

These changes were implemented in an attempt to preserve
this event for the future. As the event is \for University
students and their specifically invited guests, it is only with
student cooperation that we can expect a successful event.
Everyone should have good fun and enjoy the day while at
the same time, making these changes successful, preventing
the termination of this great SUNYA tradition.

April Gray

If we had to endorse a can-
didate solely on the basis of ex-
perience, April Gray would
have received our endorsement.
She undoubtedly has more ex-
perience in SA than any of the
other vice presidential can-
didates. Experience, however. is
only one factor to be considered
when selecting the best can»
didatc. We feel that April's lack
of leadership and innovation, as
well as her abrasive personality.
would diminish her effec-
tiveness as SA Vice President.

April is well-versed in the
working of Student Associa-
tion. She has been involved in
the budgetary process through

Donna White

Donna White comes to this
campaign with solid experience.
She has served on the UAS
Board of Directors for two
years. She has been a member
of the Pan-Caribbean Associa-
tion for two years, serving suc—
cessively as its Vice President,
President, and Treasurer. She is
presently a Supreme Court
Justice. In addition. she is a
member of ASUBA and is chair
of the Educational Committee,
and in the past has been a
member of the social commit-
tee. ‘

Yet we feel that Donna
neither displayed an acute
awareness of the issues nor of—
fered substantial solutions or
new ideas — necessary qualities
in a vice president.

Donna believes the main
weakness of the current SA
leadership is that it is comprised
of a small clique, and that it is
not open to diverse ideas. She
feels that SA should be more
open to the student body. But
Donna had no concrete ideas as
to the best way of achieving
greater student participation.
She seemed to be content to rely
on those students who are
naturally inclined to become in-
volved, and proposed no solu-
tions to the problem of lack of
student involvement in SA. say-
ing she cannot force students to

John B. Martin

initially, John B. Martin's
enthusiasm and sense of humor
impressed us. He knows carn-
paign rhetoric, and he
manipulates it well. But it didn’t
take us long to realize that
although John was talking a lot.
he wasn't saying anything.

John has, he admits. “an ego
as big as the day is long," giving
him a tendency to be quite ar-
rogant. The committee felt,
however, that as a vice-
prcsidcntial candidate he offers
little to justify his arrogance.

This candidate has, he claims.
“no preconceived notions"
about the issues. We question
the effectiveness potential of a
vice-president who assumes of-
fice with no ideas, projects, or
proposed solutions. John con-

her role as State Quad Board
President. She also has - a
thorough understanding of the
legislative workings of SA as a

, result of her participation as a

Central Council representative.
In addition. she has been a
member of the Minority Affairs
Task Force. Yet despite her vast
experience. April has failed to
develop any new approaches to
the student issues she en-
counters so often.

April had a lotvof pat answers
to our questions, but her
"solutions" did not indicate
creativity or innovation. April
spouted the same rhetoric SA
candidates have always ex-
pounded and her ideas are little
different from those of the pre-
sent and past administrations
she criticizes so easily. We
doubt that the same proposals

 

care.

While she is obviously
knowledgcble in 'those areas
which touch upon her previous
experience. she seemed less in—
formed about other areas of

‘ student concern. Donna did not

indicate that she had a clear
understanding of what the up-
coming SASU and NYPIRG
referenda are all about. Her
position on the voluntary/man—
datory student tax referendum
was also unclear.

Donna is interested in student
issues and obviously is a hard
worker. But we feel she lacks
the broad awareness and in-
novation the position requires.
and we cannot endorse her can-
didacy.

that he "knows the questions."
Further inquiry on our part
revealed that he really didn't
know the questions either.

presidential role an activist one

tion would prove any more suc-
cessful than they have in the
past. .

As a strong supporter of stu-
dent rights. April has been an
active member in the Minority
Affairs Task Force. She also
would like to organize an inter-
national Women’s Week and a
Culture Weekend. aimed at pro-
moting students’ awareness of
each other. We have no doubt
that if elected vice-president.
April would carry out these ob-
jectives. The role of vice-
president. however. is far more
encompassing. She has no con-
crete plan to broaden student
awareness or involvement in
SA. Nor did she provide ideas
to make SA more accessible and
less bureaucratic, although she
criticized the present ad-

Robert Saunders

In both his opening statement
and his interview with this com-
mittee, Robert Saunders offered
some very positive suggestions
to improve Student Associa-
tion. However, certain con-
tradictions in his statement, as
well as a lack of answers to key
points, leave Rob without our
endorsement for the office he
seeks.

Rob resigned from Central
Council twice —— once under
pressure and again later on his
own initiative. He stated two
reasons for his resignation: his
feeling of uselessness in Council
and his claim that his Central

Councli project -—- a survey to -

increase student involvement in
RA selection — was merely
glanced at and subsequently
thrown away. The contradic-
tion, we found, was that Rob.
in his frustration with Council,
decided to leave that organiza-
tion instead of trying to correct
the problem from within. Since
one of his major ambitions is to
help strengthen and shape SA
internally: the committee
wondered what would happen if

he became frustrated in his’

endeavors while vice-president.
The two major policy pro-
posals that Rob made each have
good points. but both are offset
by disturbing negatives. He
plans. if elected. to appoint ap-
proximately ten assistants to the
vice president to act as his of-
ficial representatives and attend
Quad Board meetings to answer
questions concerning SA. We
felt there were two major pro-
blems with this proposal. It
didn't seem as if he had fully
outlined the purpose of these

 

ministration for inaction on
these issues. ‘

We are also concerned with
April's ability to get along with
SA members, as well as the
University administration.
April is aggressive and of strong
character; however. her tenden-
cy toward abrasiveness could
prove detrimental to her ability
to negotiate within and outside
of 'SA.

lf April were elected, SA
would remain very much like it
is today. Stagnation, however.
is not what SA needs now. SA

must grow to meet the needs of L

a constantly changing student
body. We feel that April is not
able to provide the leadership or
fresh ideas needed to lead SA in

this important period of

growth.

assistants, and had neglected
also many of the possible uses

for such a potentially important '

group of people. In addition,
although he attacked the
“uselessness” of assistants to
the SA Controller, he did not
explain how his assistants would
differ.

Rob's other major proposal
was to set up a Women's Safety
Task Force on campus. He
seemed unaware of the fact that
there already exists such a Task
Force; although his remark may
have been a deliberate indicator
of his perceived success of the
Task Force, we questioned why

I

 ’1 ' 3Y1“. I“
he had not helped the group
already established. Rob’s ex-
planation that members were
hand picked by Task Force in-
itiator Brian Levy was inade-
quate. lf women's safety was a
major concern all along for
Rob. he would have become in-
volved regardless of cir—
cumstances.

Rob believes firmly in involv-
ing more students in SA.
HOWever. he said also that he
would. as vice president, try to
reduce the number of Central
Council members from 33 to 24.
He was adamant in his feeling
that Council members should
communicate more with

       

 

 

students about how to vote on
certain policies. but we could
not fathom how a cut in
membership would increase stu-
dent input. .

Rob seemed unsure of a plan
for total student communica-
tion. His feeling that freshman
should become more involved
and his desire to appoint
freshmen to assistant positions
is quite worthy. But when asked
about the best way to relate to
students. he replied that he
didn't know the best way,
although he considered the pro-
blcm an important one. We
agree the problem is important;
what we need is a solution.
Robert Saunders doesn’t seem

. to have one.

Rob views the role of vice

‘ president as that of uvpo\\cy§

maker and boss, but also feels
that whoever is SA President
will dictate policy anyway. He
said he wants to run an active
campaign but that he is unsure
if he will do that. He also stated
that the way to deal with the ad-
ministration is to go right to the
top; yet he is unsure of what to
do when he gets there. Finally,
he said he does not favor fun-
ding of “politically minded"
groups (such as Coalition
Against Nukes), but supports
funding of the Albany Peace
Project because it fulfills an
“informational” capacity. He
seems unsure as to where one
draws the line.

Rob is running for vice presi-
dent because he feels he has the
ability, ideas, and desire to do
the job. and also because he
cares. Although this committee
appreciates his desire and level
of caring, his incomplete ideas
and lack of proven ability made
us more than reluctant to award
him this endorsement.

 

 

—— nearly that of a co-president.
He denounced the “SA clique."
and while he does agree SA has
a workable foundation, he feels
it is time to “let fresh air into
SA.” But with few ideas and no
experience. John is not. we feel.
the “fresh air" SA needs. The
only project John suggested was
peer advisement. Yet again. he
had no concrete, structured.
thought-out strategies to offer.

A former member of the
Young Republicans. John op-
poses funding of so-called
“political” groups on campus.
But though a potential

“co-president," he gave no
other policy opinions.

John’s energetic, and he can
doublc~talk circles around many
other candidates. His Carteres-
que “untainted outsider" argu-
ment and rhetoric reminiscent
of Jerry Brown’s campaign just
might get him elected some day.
But if that ofﬁce were to be SA

Vice-President, the organiza-.

tion and its constituents would
suffer. As long as John refuses
to address the issues, he will be
unable to propose solutions,
and we cannot endorse him for
the vice-presidential ofﬁce.
