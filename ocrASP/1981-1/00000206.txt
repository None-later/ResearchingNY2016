Central Council

Lowers Required

Voter Turnout

Central Council voted last
Wednesday to change the voter
turnout required to pass a
referendum from 20 percent to
10 percent.

Council members argued that
since only one candidate is run-
ning for SA president this year,
many students will not bother to
vote in the election. lfat least 20
percent of the student body
does not vote, the tlicce referen—
dum included on the ballot, the
SASU, NYPlRG and man-
datory vs. voluntary student tax
rcferenda will automatically
fail.

“This should really be viewed
as an emergency,” SA Vice
President Brian Levy said in
asking that the council vote to
change the percentage required.

Other members were opposed
to the change in policy. SA
Controller lra Somacli said that
a 20 percent voter turnout is
“not asking too much" to ex-
pcet.

Soniacli also said that it is
“ridiculous that evei‘ytimc we
get into a bind, we change the
rules."

Mandatory Tax: Necessary- Funding

Every two years SUNY
students vote whether their SA
tax should remain mandatory or
voluntary. in the past, students
have always strongly supported
SA by pulling the lever under
"mandatory." They realize that
with a "voluntary" system,
every students would suffer.

The entire SA system would
be even more complicated with
a voluntary option. Budgeting
and planning would be impossi-

N YPIRG:

We cannot stress strongly
enough the importance of tlie
NYPIRG referendum. The New
York Public Interest Research
Group is a student supported
and directed research and ad-
vocacy oraganization giving
students the opportunity to
hone citizenship skills while ef-
fecting some social change.
Albany is one of 18 member
campuses around the state in-
volved in statewide and local
projects dealing with govern-
ment reform, higher education,
nuclear power. and consumer
rights, to name just a few.

ble. Funding for groups. ser-
vices and intercollegiate
athletics would have to be cut
sharply. And by paying all the
money to SA in the form of a
mandatory tax, you allow SA to
collect interest on your money.
That extra income allows for
ever more activities and pro-
gramming.

Most students don't even
think about just how many ac-
tivities the $77 fee supports. It is
the money you pay to enjoy the

Torch, WCDB, Mayf'est,
movies, concerts, speakers.

food and record co-ops.-

cultural groups, Viewpoints,
Tangent, and AMIA and WIRA
sports.

It is the money that supports
Five Quad, Camp Dippikill,
Legal Services, Parent’s
Weekend, Pep Band, Middle
Earth and Quad Boards.

These clubs and activities
would not be possible without
the student tax. There would no

longer be discounts' on} special 1
events. Athletic teams and
events would be decreased.

It is hard to believe that any
student who is aware of how
many activities and groups SA
supports would vote for a
voluntary tax. A vote to con-
tinue mandatory tax shows you
see this school as more than just
classes and want SA to continue
funding just about everything
you enjoy on this campus.

Lobbying for Students

NYPIRG has certainly done
its share to improve the quality
of life for Albany students. It
was one of the members of the
suit that earned students voting
rights in the county. NYPIRG
has also produced two studies
on polution in the Hudson
River and on Long Island.

Not only has NYPIRG in-
volved itself in research pro-
jects, biil it also has one of the
most active lobbying groups in
the State Capitol. Two paid
professional lobbyists are
assisted by 8 to 15 students
receiving academic credit. The

lobbying program represents
students as well as many under-
represented peoplc throughout
the state. This group has had
many legislative victories, in-
cluding Decriminalization of
Marijuana, Truth in Testing
and the Generic Drug Law.
These legal reforms could not
have been accomplished
without the long hours put in by
NYPIRG’s active lobbying
Staff.

The students of SUNY
Albany have every reason to
continue their support of
NYPIRG. 11 is one of the most

active voices for safe energy,
clean air. higher education. con-
sumer rights, and students
rights in New York State.

NYPIRG now receives two
dollars per student each
semester. A yes vote on the
NYPIRG funding referendum
will maintain this amount, and
allow this group to continue its
active role serving the citizens
and students of Albany. We
very strongly urge all students
to vote yes on this referendum
so NYPlRG can continue serv-
ing the people of this state.

SASU: Fighting
for Student

Rights Statewide.  

ring some 

 

  
 

 

 

Included on this year’s ballot
will be a referendum on the con-
tinuing support of the Student
Association of the State Univer-
sity (SASU). Funding of SASU
would raise the student activity
fee $1.50 per student per
semester. The ASP fully en—
dorses the continued support of
this worthwhile student ad-
vocacy organization.

SASU works statewide and
year-round lobbying for your
benefit at the Legislature, the
SUNY Central Administration,
and the Governor’s office.
While many an apathetic stu-
dent rcmains inactive at tuition
hikes, SASU members are plan-
ning rallies, letter-writing cam-
paigns, and lobby days.

SASU played an integral role
in the reappropriation of state
funds to the SUNY system in
1980, preventing the proposed
elimination of 2,200 faculty
positions and possible retren-
chments of entire departments.

The organization has won
victories in — and continues to
fight for — student voting
rights.

SASU won an increase in the
minimum TAP award from
$100 to $200, and secured stu-
dent- representation on the
SUNY Board of Trustees and
College Councils.

The ASP strongly urges
students to ensure the continued
existence of. SASU and its
resulting benefits by voting
“yes” on the SASU referendum
tomorrow. Thursday, and Fri-

try.
You can't afford not to.
