Pologe

Hello. My name is David Pologe
and I’m going to be your next SA
president. This is not a pompous or
over conﬁdent statement made by a
candidate in a crowded ﬁeld.
Rather it is a statement which
relates to the fact that I am running
unopposed.

Running unopposed has its ad-
vantages and disadvantages. The
 best part about it is that I have
spent $17.80 on a campaign that
a: often costs hundreds. The worst

right currently going on in educa-
tion as well as in politics. If SA
wishes to keep our liberal arts
education liberal, it must organize
itself better. Therefore, I would
suggest that the vice president take
on the responsibility of project
coordinator for SA. In this way, the
executive branch of SA can
organize and push SA towards ac-
complishments in all ﬁelds; in-
cluding academics.

There is currently $90,000 in the
SA general fund. This illustrates the
fact that SA has been too conscr-
vative when spending in recent
years. They have been afraid to
spend money on groups that are a

has to realize that ifthcy don‘t fund
such culturally diverse groups,
nobody will. In addition. if such
groups do not exist at universities
where diverse ideas are supposedlyu
encouraged. then they will exist
nowhere. SA must loosen its grip on
student money.

I hope you see that SA can be an
active and effective group. and I

Popper

My real name is Steven Popper; I
am running as Woody only because
that is what everybody calls me.

In the past, SA Vice Presidents
have come from major posts within
SA. This year. none of the can-
didates can claim a great amount of
experience in SA, so other criteria
must be employed in selecting a
candidate.

I doubt that all of the candidates
actually realize exactly what the job
they are running for entails. Under
a Dave Pologe administration, the
role of the vice president would
basically be that of Project-
Coordinator. This would require
the vice president to have the ability
to effectively manage a large staff

WWu—Wumw‘.

V reasons given for not supporting

another.)
As you could well imagine. prior
involvment in a SA legislative body

'would be of little help In this type of

management situation. I unders-
tand the awesome amount of work
that this job will require. but I
wonder whether the other can-
didates do. In planning my personal
life for the next year. I have an-
ticipated that the job of SA Vice
President will demand at least 60
hours per week of my time, and I
will commit myself. right here, in
print, to that level of involvement,
which is necessary to do the job
right.

The vice president also has a
great deal of input into deciding
what projects should be under-
taken. Lct mc briefly go over some
of the things I would like to see ac-
complished. I would like groups to
work together more. sharing
resources. I am also concerned with
the rising cost of education and the
proposed cuts in ﬁnancial aid pro-

ing students fight high costs, lack of security, and

of students, working on many dif-
ferent projects simultaneously, in-
cluding the daily administrative
functions of SA, and to see that the
policies of SA are implemented con-
sistenly throughout all programs.
(The importance of consistency is
that it prevents double standards
where the reasons for supporting
one effort are simultaneously the

grams. off campus housing needs
more attention; helping students
fight high costs. lack of security,
and abuses by landlords. 0n cam-
pus we must fight the many areas in
which the univcristy does not afford
its students due process. For exam-
pic. housing can put a hold on a stu-
dent's transcript for failing to pay
disputublc damages.

Realistically, the preference he
supports could mean the end of
SA and all sponsored groups.
The committee believes that if
Steve understood the long range
effects more clearly, he would
support a mandatory tax to en-
sure both SA's future existence
and a workable budget in the
fall.

The committee does feel that.
if elected, Steve would live up to
his promise of activism. Steve
criticized the past administra-
tion for being reactionary, and
we believe he would provide
strong leadership. However, we
cannot endorse Steve for the
vice-presidency because of his
lack of broad understanding of
strident groups and issues.
