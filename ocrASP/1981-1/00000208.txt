Saunders

Many people have questioned my
motives for running for Student
Association Vice President. 1 intend
to clarify everything now.

First of all. many people question
tny committrnent to SA as a result
of my resignation froth Central
Council. During my term. i perceiv-

lcd an overall feeling of uselessncss.

Granted. there has been better cott-
trol this year. but Council could
have been more productive.

I feel that SA has the capacity to

'. do so much, and I’d like to take a
' major role in what i feel tnust be a
reformation of SA. For that pro-

any questions anyone may have
concerning SA. This gives us a
somewhat better rapport with the
Quads.

Part of the problem this year has
been no input from the students.
Central Council reps are voting on
crucial. important issues without
consulting any of those to he af-
fected. i think that there should be
policies concerning representation,
and there should be strict adherence
to these policies. It’s a project i
would like to undertake as SA Vice
President.

Another of my ideas concerns the
Women‘s Safety Task Force. 1
would begin an immediate. func-
tioning committee to look at an

“Central Council reps. are voting on crucial, im-
portant issues without consulting any of those to

be affected.”

 

 ject. l have many ideas.

Every year. SA candidates claim

:that they will bring tnorc students

into SA. However. i have yet to see

any such influx of new talent. I
I have some real ideas.

The vice president has the power
to appoint "assistants to serve at
his/her pleasure." Why hasn't this
happened in the past? 1 would
solicit applications for these posi-

tlotts. and get more people involv-

I’ cd.

These assistants would become
the ofﬁcial representatives of the
vice president on various occasions.
One of the main functions they

< would serve would be to attend

Quad Board meetings. and answer

issue that has been overlooked for
too long. With the numerous at-
tacks this year. and the most recent
one on-campus. l fch funds should
go toward this before almost
anything else.

Finally. 1 ltave two major reasons
for running. i feel i have the ability
and the ideas to do a more than ade-
quate job. i may not have as much
experience, but I have the desire to
do the job well. l‘m also rttnning
because I care. i don’t need this for
a resume later, because i already
have a job when l graduate. Con~
sidcr it!

Get the facts. and hear all the
ideas. You'll votc Rob Saunders for
Student Association Vice President.

 

Martin

By this time it is no secret that
.John B. Martin is running for SA
Vice President. The reasons for this
move on my part are many. As an
SA otttsidcr I see my candidacy as.
in effect. opening a window and let-
‘ting fresh air into our student
government. SA has. as we all have
observed, become entirely too cli-
quish an organization over the past
few years. The result of this has
proved detrimental to the running
of the Student Association. Consc-
qucntly SA has bccotnc stodgy.
sluggish and is failing itt its ultimate
purpose. That is, to uphold the
rights and interests of the entire slu-
dcnt population here at SUNYA.

'students who would be familiar

with various majors and professors.
As recompense for their services
these students could recieve room
waivers. This idea has acheived ad-
mirable success in such schools as
Oeneseo.

In regards to curriculum commit-
tees. i would like to see students, or
at least student Senators among the
ranks. At this time, as we are all too
aware. Students have no direct con-
trol in the selection of which
courses are retained and which are
abolished.

As 1 have mentioned repeatedly
throughout this campaign I would
like to see SA made more respon-
sive to the needs of SUNYA
students. Several means could be
employed to achieve this goal. One
such mean would be an SA newslet-
ter drawn up on a bivweckly basis to
keep students informed on the
workings of their government. Fur-
thermore SA officers could make
themselves available periodically in

“. . .I hope to make SA more accountable to the
students and bring about a greater degree of stu-
dent involvement in our government.”

 

i see my office as a means of
making SA tnorc responsive to the
needs and wants of all SUNYA
students. in doing so i hope to
make SA more accountable to the
students and bring about a greater
degree of student involvement itt
our governtncnl. it is, after all.
their government. These. of course,
are very broad aims. In addition 1
have a variety of pet projets if you
will which I hope to see realized
during my term in office.

To begin with. i would like to in-
itialc a form of peer advisement in
each of the dorms. This advisement
would be run by upper class

the several Flagrooms to hear cont-
plaints and answer questions. Final-
ly in this vein 1 would like to set up
SA interest meetings for those
students interested in entering the
ranks of the Student Association.

These proposals mentioned here
really only scratch the surface of the
many new ideas and goals 1 hope to
acheive during my term in office.
Let me close by rcaffirmiong the
fact that i it"! fully confident and
look forward to an enjoyable, pro-
ductch and active year as the Stu-
dent Association Vice President of
the State University of New York at
Albany.

' As a Central Council Represen-
tative I realize that this year’s ad-
ministration has failed to involve
fstudEnts. Unfortunately, they have *
yalso alienated 'many qualified. '
' capable individuals by their policies
land procedures. Many elected
; representatives have felt stiﬂed and”
, are not running for re-clection. One
of numerous issues which was
decided without REAL student in-
put was Mayfcst. The tradition has
been replaced by a high priced af-
fair. which has many unnecessary
changes.

Student Association has over 80
funded or recognized groups. Many
groups have a problem similar to
SA’s. a lack of qualiﬁed leadership.
The recognized groups which are
functioning well (Class Councils)
have had to light for their own pro-

tion has to reestablish its

fits; yet, those that are faltering are
being penalized.

During my term as State Quad
Board President we had an open ad-
ministration. all ideas and opinions
were discussed fully. l delegated
authority and assisted in the pro-
gramming. in addition to being a
Central Council Rep. 1 have active-
ly participated in its Student Action
and Internal Affairs Committees. 1
have also been a member of the
Minority Affairs Task Force and
the University Budget Panel.

i feel that Student Association
should organize the Group Fair for
the Fall semester to introduce
students to the groups. 1 would like
