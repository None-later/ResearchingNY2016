The late 1970's and early 1980's

1‘ have been seen by some observers as
' a time of rampant student apathy

concerning those issues which affect

students. Campus participation in
, student rallies. elections. attd activi-

ty in student government is alarm-
ingly low. Student interest and cott-
fidcnce in our own Student Associa-
tion seems to be on the decline.
What is needed to bring about a

for students on campus as SA Vice
President. The past two years that l
have served on Central Council give
me the experience that it takes to
operate effectively in this role.

i have also been active in campus
and community affairs through my
fraternity. Kappa Alpha Psi. this
year. we raised over seven hundred
dollars through our green ribbon
drive benefitting the 23 slain
cltiidrctt in Atlanta. Our toy drive
last Christmas provided needy area
children with toys for Christmas.

“I will act as a student voice in making sure that
student concerns are properly articulated to those
who hold power in the university administration.”

 

eversal in this apathetic ntood on
our campus? First of all. concerned
tudents who really care about stu-
dent government and campus issues
re needed to organize and run a
cpsonsive and effective student

 

'  organization. Secondly, it takes
.2}  knowledgeable and experienced siti-
' at

dent leaders to make student
overnment more accountable to
hose whont it serves. i truly feel
hat 1 can help the Student Associa-

' . _. ion become a tnorc effective voice

The fraternity also participated in a
comntunity voter registration drive
last November.

I atn also a member of the
Minority Affairs Task Force here
on campus. 1 ant ajunior, majoring
itt Political Science.

If elected SA Vice President. i
will use the office to make sure that
students who have grievttttccs or
problems will ltavc someone who
will listen to their problems and
take action. i will act as a student

l’m proud of you.

these who hold power in the univer-

those students who may now be
under-represented on campus. as

to organirc an international
Women's chk to facilitate cont-

establish workshops. i would also
like to coordinate a Culture
Weekend to bring the groups
together and expose students to
each other.

it is my belief that Student
Asocitttion ltas to reestablish its
credibility and represent the
students. My record has clearly
shown that I represent and fight for
sltltlcnts and issues relevant to
them. it also shows that i have the
experience and contmiltntent necd-
ed to do the job. i urge all tax pay-
