Finally, after four disappointing years of inefficient stu-
dent government, there is now something for seniors to
write home about.

On a cold, dark, lonely night in the campus center,
Crazy Gary, Crazy Bob, Crazy Brad and the rest of the
Crazy Class Council slashed your senior week ticket
prices by an'incredible 50 percent over last years prices.

But that wasn’t good enoughll We defied inflation and
stayed well past building hours and slashed those prices
to such hnredﬂﬂy louileveb that even gouenunent
economists winced at ourfanatic disregard for the laws of

finance.
The Crazy Class Council. . .
. . . Our Prices Can’t Be Beat. . .
