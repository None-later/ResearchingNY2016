Non-discrimination is Promised

by IIch Setter

Central Council p *d an SA
nou-discritniturtiotr policy April l4.

Tire policy states that all students
should be granted "equal oppor-
tunity in educational programs atrd
actisitics...rcgattllcss of race. color.
disability. religion. sc\. scsnal
otierttation. age or natiotral
origin.“ The policy applies to all
SA recogni/etl groups.

The decision to create a trott-
dtscritnination policy arose after a
proposed SA affirmative action
policy was withdrawn.

'l'hc affitutathe actiott policy.

 

which was written in I980 arid
tnodeled al'tcr trttiversity policy.

New Policy is Passed by SA

Gray explained tlrat since SA is part
of the university. it cannot have
"conflicting policies" with the
university.

Both Gray atrd Affirmative Ae-
tiotr Researcher Tina Wynn. who
co-Wt‘otc the IIOII>LIISUI’IIIIlIltIlIOIl
policy. agreed tltat gays atrd les-
bians slrotrld be itrcltrded witlritr art
eqtral opportunity policy. The
switch frorn an SA affirmative ac-
tiotr policy to a non-disctitnirratiotr
policy means that all rrtirrority
gtottps are represented. said Wynn.

Included in the new policy are
guidelines outlining the functions of
the tltitlotil) affairs coordinator
and the Minority Aflaits Task
force. as well as policy for employ-
itrg SA student assistants.

Board Approves Memorial College and Institute

by Debbie Judge
A SUNYA trrernorial college arid
a separate but related SUNY-wide

 

institute of ptrblic al'f' 'aud policy
was approved Wednesday by the
SUNY Board of 'l'tustees as a
tnetnorial to the late Governor
Nelson A. Rockefeller, thc mull
credited with tlte developtnent of
the SUNY system.

The two institutions will be nam-
ed the Nelson A. Rockefeller Col-
lege of Public A" ‘ atrd Policy
arid the Rockefeller Itrstitrrte of
Government.

The Rockefeller College will con
sist of Albany's existing schools of
Criminal Justice. Social Welfare.
and Graduate School of Public Af-
fairs (GSPA), as well as research
units of the Institute of Govern-
tncnt attd Policy. the Institttte of

Gerontology. the (‘errtet for
Women in Government. the (‘ont
putative Development Studies
Center and the ('entet for Mcrttal
Ilcaltlr Policy Studies, all establish-
ed at Albany within tltc past five
years.

Chancellor Clifton R. Wharton
said at a press conference Wednes-
day that the establislrttrent of tire
memorials would not require addi-
tional funds. Ilc also voiced the
hope that otrce the irrstittrtc is
established. its activities will attract
significant sttppott from the private
sector.

The three cotnpottetrt schools
would retaitt their atrtorrorny within
the college. said School of Criminal
.lrrstice Dean Donald Newman.
Each of the tltrcc tleans of the
schools would serve a two-year term

as cirair of the ctttitc college on a
rotating basis. atrd college staff will
be filled from existing positions.
The college will be part of
SUNY/\‘s regular acadetnic struc»
ture. with its director rcportirtg to
the Vice President for Academic
Affairs atttl SUNYA President.

The locatton of lllc college is
unclear at the presetrt time; current-
ly the (ESPA is located uptown and
the scirools of Welfare atrd
Criminal Justice are centered on the
downtown campus. “It‘s my per-
sonal guess." said (iSI’A Dean 0r-
ville Poland. “that there will he no
physical move."

He also projected. as did Warren
Ilchtrrarr. Vice .sident for
Research. that if tlrctc were arty
relocation. the undergraduate com-
ponent of the (iSPA. at least.

r‘.

would remain on the rrptowtr catn-
pus. According to llchman. this and
other structural issues will be dealt
witlr iii the treat future.

Whereas the Rockefeller ('ollege
is ptedomiuantly a SUNYA entity.
the Rockefeller Institute of Llovetn-
rnent will be a .systeruwide facility.
I~Iowcvcr the two ate like itr that
the dcatr of SUNY/\‘s GSI’A will
also serve as director of the in-
stitute. atrd several college staff
members will work at the institute.

According to Ilchmtrn. a national
search will soon be eottdtrcted to
find a suitable deatt.

Later this spring. SUNY
Chancellor (‘lil‘ton R. Wharton Jr.
will appoint a board of oversect's to
guide the ittslitute's activities.

Chancellor Wharton said the irr-
stitttte will offer internships to

students throughout the SUNY
system and fellowships will he
granted to distinguished persons.
Research on state government and
public policy will be conducted. The
itrslitttte will also serve as a centet
for public policy research at all
SUNY 'atnpuscs.

The lnstitutc‘s administrative of-
' attd conference rooms will be
located in the SUNYA-owned
historical tmvnhotrse at 4“ State
Street. SUNYA will provide the in-
itial staff. and the SUNY Research
Foundation will provide core sup-
port for the Institute for realloca-
tiort of existing resources.

The final decision cattte Wetlllcs~
day ttfternoon at n rubber-stamping
session of the SUNY Iloartl of
Trustees where the board voted as
anticipated. and approved the bike.

The one dissenting voice in tire

board‘s l4-l vote was that of Stu~
detrt Association of State University
tSASll) President Jim Stein.

Stern feels the board “gave up
tlte battle too early." lie predicted
that runny SUNY students would be
pushed out of college hecatisc they
could not afford the cost increases
along with expected cuts itr student
grants tmtl loans.

The ttritiotr trike catue as a sur-
prise to no one. As early as two
months ago Chancellor Clifton R.
Wharton Jr. came before the Joint
Legislative fiscal committees itt

favor of the hike and said that even
if the legislature restored SUNY
funds he could not guarantee that
the tnortey would go to offsetting
the tuition bike.

The move to raise tuition had
received preliminary approval in
February atrd SUNY officials
already added the $20 million itr ex-
pected new revenue to their Will-82
budget proposals.

Although the legislature has yet
to pass the state budget. with the
tuition trike for SUNY irt it. it
would be very unlikely that this

tittre arty change will occur.

SASU Vice President .larricc Fine
said they see the situation as finalit-
ed. “Students will definitely be pay-
ing $150 more next semester." said
Fine.

The tuition Irike received a but»
rtrgc of criticism frotn both
legislators arid students who latn-
busted the board for not asking for
state funds to restore the budget
cuts before imposing a tuition trike.

“If the governor's office will
negotiate the SUNY budget with

However. after several com-
plaitrts. allowed to
vote at arty location. by mid-
Thursday afternoon. 'l‘arpinian
said.

“We‘re ttyirrg to clarify that peo-
ple cart vote wherever they want.

not feel that very rnnrry students
were ttrrtrcd away from the polls.
although NYPIRG State Board
mcruber Leslie Haber said a “good
number" complained to her.

'I‘nrpinian said that he did not ex-
pect this year's turnout to equal the
20 percent of students who voted
last year. There were approximately
l.l00 votes cast on Wednesday and
Thursday while last year's total was
approxitnately 2.000 votes. he said.

Aside from the location pro-
blems. Tarpiniatr said. the election
has rtrn smoothly. Tire polls close
this afternoon. Results should be
tabulated by 8:00 p.ni.. tic said.
