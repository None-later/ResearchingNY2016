Interest in El S’dlvadorInCreases ‘o'n' "Campuses "

(CPS) On May 3. campus sentiment
against U.S. involvement In El
salvador will go through what
amounts to a rite of passage for
political movements: it will stage its
own march on Washington, DC.
The march caps what organizers
call “the busiest protest season
since Three Mile Island," and
marks what these same organizers
— very aware of comparisons to the
first college stirrings against U.S.
involvements in Vietnam irt I964 —
call a “transition period" frotn
“scattered. community-based pro-
test" to a tttore "political" phttsc.
Campus activities in the last six
months against U.S. IZI Salvador
policies have indeed been bollt
spontaneous and widespread,
unlike the more cnrcfttlly-urrttngcd
rcccnl campus rallies against upar~
tltcid itt South Africa, nuclear
power, and the draft. A March pro-
test at the University of(?alifornitt~
Riverside “peaked” at 70 people,
while a match trt the University of
MIISSIIL‘IIIIN‘CIIS‘AIIIIICI‘SI surprised
ot'gttni/crs it few days later when it
drew I,200 students and faculty.
Not litnitcd to larger state
schools, activity has been reported
from Loyolrt University itt New

Orleans to Sinclair Community and
Grand Valley State colleges in
Michigan. All featured speakers
and seminars on U.S. foreign
policies, colloquially called
“teach-ins."

Service commemorating the first
anniversary of the death of Salt
Salvadoran Archibishop Oscar
Rontcro attracted 150-400 students
each at the University of Illinois,
Iowa State, the University of
Maryland, and Yale University.
The majority of those services were
sponsored itt conjunction with the
Committee itr Solidarity with the
People of I€l Salvador (CISI’ES). a
national organi/uliott boasting
tnctttbctship of ttXIcollcgc branches
and "countless" cotrttnttttity
groups.

The l‘llpltl growth of the move—
ment is “really trrtitt/ing." says
lIcidi Tttrvcr of the national
Washington office of CISPES. She
says most of the college ('ISI’IES
orgttttirttlions fortttcd itt “about
three or four months." and some
grew ottt of other community
orgttttiuttiorts, such as church
groups.

Turvct' points ottt that most of
them issue their opposition through

teach-ins. Campus debates and
speakers generally focus on
CISPES’ main goals, including sup-
port of human rights, aid to
refugees. ending U.S. involvement
in El Salvador, and “generally
educating" Americans about the El
Salvador situation.

Organizers don't actively
understimate the fruits of their
labors. Teach-ins. Tarver claims,
rarely fail to itttercst more students
in the movement.

Tens of thousands, “perhaps
hundreds of thousands" have
hecornc involved in El Salvadoran
activities since September, estimates
James I’ctrtts. sociology professor
at tltc State University of New
York-Binghatnton. He says educa-
tiottal progt‘ttttts draw in more divcr~
sificd groups to tire cause. ntttny
with religious affiliations.

"The striking port of the enor-
mous growth of the movement is
the religious ovcrtone." Pclrtts
observes. “Most prevalent is tltc ac-
tive work of particularly Catholic
organizations and nuns and priests.
Considering the numbers of
Catholics murdered daily itt El
Salvador. their participating is ttot
surprising. httt it sets this movement
apttrl front some others.”

Also drawn to the issue are t‘ttcul-
ty groups, which Ttrrver explains
are just becoming organized. Stutt-
ford University's Richard liagcn has
been one of many faculty members
who've managed to accumulate

ll,5005ignatures of colleagues on a
petition to be presented to the State
Department protesting U.S. in-
volvement in El Salvador.

Although Petras maintains “the
great bulk ofU.S. faculty opposes"
American involvement, others may
not be quick to agree. A special
faculty meeting called by University
of Texas President Peter Flawn for
the purpose of publicly opposing
U.S. involvement failed to attain a
quorum, much less a favorable
vote. History professor Thomas
Philpott called the low attendance
"extraordinary" and "unthink-
able." but colleague Ira lscoc
replied, "Professors ought not to
get involved."

The issttc similarly polarilcs stu-
dctrt governments, which are
typically forch to face the issue
when debating whether to grant
charters to potential (‘ISI’IZS nf-
filitttcs. Sonic brattchcs of the
organization have told Washington
headquarters getting rccogrtitiott
was "no problem," but still others
not into harsh debates and are even

At New Orleans' Loyola Univer-
sity. a newly-formed (‘ISI’ES group
received a Student Government
Association charter only after a
long attd heated debate. Law
dclcgutc Fruttk Milanese argued
vehemently for the opposition in
the student newspaper when he
warned the group “is a radical

smacks of communism."

Students at George Mason
University in Virginia were not so
lucky. Their application for a
university charter was denied on the
grounds that “they lacked clear
plans." A university spokesman
denied the action was “politically
motivated." but would-be CISPES
officers remain unconvinced.

Granting university recognition
hardly guarantees a group support
of the community, however. Mar-
chers at the UMass-Amhcrst protest
drew hcckles from dorm windows.
Onlookcrs reportedly insulted mur-
chcrs, and students favoring U.S.
activities itt El Salvador drowned
out the chants of the marchers by
playing “Ballad of the Green
Bcrcls” on it sound systctn.

The polarization of sludcttts and
faculty over the El Salvador issue
reminds most people almost
automatically of the Vietnam tutti-
wnt movement, and indeed.
SUNY's l’etrtts finds “rentarkttblc”
comparisons.

“The tench-ins and scattered pro-
tests we see now about El Salvador
roughly compare to the stage of tltc
Vietnam movement irr late I964 or
I965," Pctras asserts. “It's getting
to the poittt where people with
diverse interests are getting involv-
cd, not just people who have a
history of being politically active."

Active participants no longer in-
clude only those people who were
active in the Vietnam movement
and are interested in ﬁnding a
"cause" once more, nor is it limited
to people who feel they “missed the
Vietnam movement" and want to
get in on these activities, agrees
CISPES' Tarvcr.

“The breadth and nature of the
movement against U.S. involve-
ment in El Salvador is analgous to
Vietnam." she says. “But this is
growing tttttch fttstcr than the six-
ties."

I’ctrns is conﬁdent that the move-
tncttt will contitttrc its rapid growth
if the U.S. government refuses to
alter its policies in El Salvador. Ht:
predicts a dirch parallel between
the growth of U.S. involvemetrt in
Central America and the growth of
activism at Ironic.

Asked Itow quickly the El
Salvador movement will get to a
stage comparable to tire Vietnam
movement itt 1968 or I969, Ire
estimates “a year or two at this
rate, provided U.S. policies do not
change."

“We're in a very important tran-
sition state right now." Petras says.
“We've beetr going through the
educational stage — consisting of
teach-ins, mostly -— to the point
where there is protest and rallies.
Now we have to see protest turn in-
to politics with more specific
goals."

Whether the El Salvador move-
mettt will successfully make the
transition from “protest to
politics" will be most clearly seen at
the May 3 rally in Washington.

Organized by the People’s Anti-
War Mobilization committee
(PAM) based in Washinton. the ral-
Iy might attract as many as 100,000
people from all over the country.
according to Dick Cushing of
PAM. He says PAM has developed
a network of organizations in at
least 70 cities in five weeks to “do
tltc leg work," including soliciting
scltool funds to cover travel ex-
pcnses.
