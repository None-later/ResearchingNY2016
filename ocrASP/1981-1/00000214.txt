After the scrubdowns. the tile

other adjustments. NASA’s space
shuttle Columbia will be ready for
its second Orbital Test Flight, to
take place this fall. Along with
astronauts Richard H. Truly and
Joe Henry Engle. numerotts ex-
perimental packages will be carried

. into orbit. Among them will be the

ﬁrst university experiment to be
flown on the Columbia. which
belongs to SUNYA's Bernard Von-
negut. Senior Scientist of the At-
mospheric Science Research Center.
“Some years ago NASA an-
nounced they would received pro-
posals for experiments to be done
on the Columbia space flights."
Vonnegut said. “We submitted a
proposal in Fall 1976. and it was ac-
cepted in Summer 1977."

“We're particularly interested in
very severe lightning produced in
hurricanes. tornadoes, and volcanic
activity." Vonnegut said. "We're
also interested in how the storms
serve as a high voltage generator
and just what the role of the elctrici-
ty in the storm is."

Accounts from Skylab astronauts
describe an exhilarating overall view
of lightning which cannot be ap-
preciated at lower altitudes. Also.
the area of the Earth's surface visi-
ble from the space shuttle will be
large enough so that lightning
storms are likely to be visible on
every orbit.

The hardware of the Nighttime—
Daytime Optical Survey of Lightn-
ing and Convective Phenomena
(NOSL) experiment includes a l6
millimeter Maurcr tnovic camera.
which will furnish movie pictures of
the storm in progress. and a
photocell sensor system. which
together with the camera forms a
handheld apparatus approximately
twice the sire of an ordinary Super 8
movie camera.

The photocell systettt has a light
sensitive receiving area which points

lens. When there is a change in the
frequency of the incoming light, as
when lightning suddenly ﬂashes.
the change will be recorded by the
photocell. An audio pickup will, in
turn. transform the changes in light
frequency into an audio signal that
will be recorded on magnetic tape.

"Lightning sounds like static on
the radio.“ Vonnegut explained.

Analysis of the "static" on an
oscilloscope results in an electronic
signature characteristic to the type
of lightning which produced it.
When filming nighttime lightning. a
diffraction grating will be placed in
the camera. yielding a spec-
trograph. a light signature also
characteristic of the lightning. Spec-
trograph results can be used to
determine tlte tctnperaturcs.
pressures. electron density, and
ionization in the cloud mass that
produced the lightning.

“For example." Vonnegut said.
“some lightning goes up above the
clouds. it has never been
photographed. We'd very much like
to photograph it and compare its
spectra with that of lightning which
comes down to earth.“

control of severe storms.

“My biggest motivation is
curiosity." Vonnegut said. adding,
"We must supply the public with
knowledge of their universe."

On the practical side. Vonnegut
points out that most of the world's
food supply depends on
thunderstorm ruins.

“Sometimes we get too much.
Sometimes we get too little." he
said. “We don‘t understand how

these things work. and we’re so
dependent upon them."

Power and communications com-
panies are also interested in the ex-
periment. Vonnegut said. because
they have proposed that lightning
detector satellites he set into orbit
by the mid-l980's.

Vonnegut’s system is completed
and ready to go. The group has got-
ten some time on heighl

joked, “The U-2‘s ﬂy at 65.000
