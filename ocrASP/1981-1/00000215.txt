hand llvo

Here‘s good news for knuckle
poppers: cracking your krutckles
won't cause huge, unsightly finger
joints. I

That's what Dr. John gould. a
specialist in hand surgery at the
University of Alabama at Birm-
ingham, asserts.

Gould says knuckle cracking
simply causes the nitrogen gas,
which is normally present in joint
tissues, to be displaced with enough
force to make that popping sound.

However. he says the nitrogen
naturally btiilds back up quite
rapidly to the point that other
knuckle popping cart take place.
The surgeon says there appears to
be no real harm in cracking or pop-
ping your knuckles if you want to
. . . unless it hurts, of course.

blown away

Are you tired of car horns that
are blasting away constantly. or of
those that blarc musical tunes you
never wanted to hear?

 

Well, the Transit Authority in
Bogota. Columbia. has come tip
with a solution. Bogota‘s El Tie/n-
po newspaper reports the Authority

has established an “anti-noise
squad" that eonfiseates the horns
of offending drivers.

“In five days,” the newspaper
says, “the squad has confiscated
over 2,0(X) horns."

Jon Duncanson is a spokesperson
for Greenpeace. He reports that
The, Rainbow Warrior. the SOD-ton
Greenpeace flagship. is now
“somewhere in the North Atlantic"
waters and steaming towards the
seal hunting area. Duncanson says
that the l9 crew members on the
ship —— which has been especially
equipped to break through ice flees
—— plans to ignore warnings by the
Canadian Coast Guard to stay out
of the icy waters.

He states that the plans are for

ships and the seals, and if
necessary. get out on the ice [Tees
and put their bodies between the
hunters and the seals.

The kill quota this year is 180,000
harp Seals, and l5.()00 hood seals.
Duncanson says that because the
hood seal is the more endangered.
The Rainbow ll’arrior plans to con-
centrate its rescue efforts on saving
the hood seals. which are usually
the ones killed at the cttd ot' the

Colorado's Governor Richard
Lamm has refused to grant an of-

Packer. the only man in US. legal

history ever to be convicted of can-
nibalisrn.

l’acker was found guilty 97 years
ago of being a cannibal after he
allegedly consumed all five of his
companions while the six were trap-
ped in the Colorado Mountains
during the winter of l874.

Governor Larntn says he was ask-
cd to pardon I’acker by a Florida
writer who believes the convicted
cannibal may have been framed.
However. said the governor. the
voters at“ Colorado would — in his

Lamm said he had “digested? all
the evidence in the case, which'had
been “gnawing” at him for some
time. “In the ﬁnal analysis." the
governor said. “I have to follow my
gut instincts." -

The governor also said ——
quoting here — “97 years after the
trial. I must presume the process
was kosher and Mr. Packer received
his just desserts."

Some people have charged that
the Packer trial was political
because he is alleged to have eaten
five of the total of only seven
living in Denver's
Hinsdalc County.

Certain kinds of music may cause
epilepsy.

British neurologists Peter
Newman and Michael Saunders
have found that some kinds of

' music cause abnormal brain wave

activity in the part of the brain that
interprets sound.

This. in turn, the doctors say. can
cause a person to experience anxie-
ty; clouded thinking; lip. eyelid and
finger twitching; and un-
consciousness when shc or he listens
to certain tunes.
