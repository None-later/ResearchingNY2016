Brinaham’s Hill

The puhhlcs crunched under Bringham's
hoot as he walked down the dark path.
Crickets chirped lroin the woods to his left
signaling the end in daylight. The last hits ol
orange skimmed thv mrn silk in the llclds.
Turning out towards the homestead he lell
the hunt rising lmm the unshade path
where the sun's light had been.

“Today was surely lint." he said quietly in
himsull,

The evening walk was Bringham's stretch
lor the day: a hot bath bclnre sleep. He
would talk things UVt’i with hlmscll. being
assured Ihat their was enough rain and sun
and that lhe harvust wuuld be plenty.

A rustle liom rho field broke his thoughts

“Who's there?" hu shouted. No answer.

“Danni wuascls." hu whispered to hlinsell.

This entire larm was once his lathui's. But

lamily moved to Kansas, A grim winter

Bringhnni remembered the day when his
lather came home and. wild with uxcliu
mom. told the lamin he had sold his shop
and bought land in Kansas He remembered
the riveting luar nl seeing his lalhur out ul
Control like that. At thirteen hu rcalizud thal
his lather had done something monstroust
irresponsible.

"Crazy and out ol his senses!" mother
had cried. it was lhe lirst tinw Bringhain had
been almid ni hi5 lalhur.

But the lainin packed and moved lnr that
was the liunily way ol doing things. Their
land tract was 15 milus duu west of Topeka.
By the second week they had a hall lnot ol
snow on tho ground lrnihui brought sonn-
Wood along in the wagon and they loud to
tronslruct a simple SllL’llt'l Mother sat in tho
wagon. shivering lrom tlu- cold. rclusing to
lend any help to Ihu proivct

Soon ulnllu'l’ sinppud lwr plms and just
cited to lll’l‘iL‘ll in tho wagon. She Would
nuvur ml much during inuals and began to

slur died.

Father knew she was ill tor a week belnrc
but could do nothing lnr her. It was too for

and Inn cold to go lur ii dnt'loi. In tho and
lalhcr and son stood by and walled lnr lit’i In
die.

Thuy could not bury the body because Iliu
ground was lrozcn solid. Father wrapme the
body in burlap and potato sack and placed il
under the wagon until spring cnmu. l‘lu
assured Bringhum that God would unders-
tand and Would still allow her soul in pass on
up to heaven. But it was many weeks bulqu
Bringham could lull deeply asleep.

When spring finally came the prairie camc-
back to lilc. Bt'lngham could see that the spot
whuru they had parked the wagon was on a
slight hill. no more than lilly feet over Ihu
surroundings. But it seemed like a mountain
in such a llat landscape.

Father chose a spot lnr mother's gravu
which looked toward the cast. Tth made a
sunplo headstone and said ach vursus hum
Matlhuw ovul the grave. They stood silently
for a long while.

“I'm sorry. Caroline. I truly am sorry." he
whispt'rud liiingham cried and ran away.

Thu following day his father wuul into
Topeka and purchased pick axes. plows,
suuds. lumlwr. and an ox. They set out with
tho liiisiiiuss nl farming Everyday was filled.
'l'hcru was always something to do. uvun at
Illt' tiinus when they were not sure how to do
it. His lnlhvr estimated they planted (‘lUSL‘ In
and one and a hall nl corn by the 28th at
April and lu' was satisllud

'l'ht' sununm was very hot llringhum had
been mud to tlu- (lull lilL‘L’LL‘S hour the
(lesuptuiku in July and August which
always look the bite out of llit,‘ sun. Thure
was no n-lk'l in Kansas lhnugh He and his
lathur could do nothing but sit on the trout
porch. (lay .iltur day and watch the corn
grow.

l'larvust was plenty. They had to make
three trips with the wagon to sell the crop.
On the last trip they bought all supplies they
may need lor winter.

Moro lumber to linlsh all the house was

the lirst item. Food and staples were of
secondary importance to his Father.

"A proper home. that Is what l-want for
you and your mother's soul." he said.

liut it was not in be. Bringham's lather
complained about pain in his joints. He was
only a man ol thirty-live and did not suspect
arthritis. The pain got so bad'that Brlugham
had to ride his lather into Topeka. Doctor
said he Would be back in ten days alter IrcatA
rnunt, But he never came back to the larm.

Doctor came to Bringham on a cold
November lst and told him that his lather
had died oi the gout. He had taken the liber-
nl having the body send back to Bringham's
grandparenls’ in Baltimore for burial. He left
alter having some lunch.

[I was slightly colder now and the stars
above were their brightest. The first quarter
rose lmm out nl the lleld and hung in the
horns nl Taurus. Bringham tapped the bowl
nl his pipe on the leg of the stool and placed
it back into his pocket.

Bringhain walked into his house and
washed his dusty lace in the porcelain basin.
Scratching his heard. he contemplated shav-
lug and decided that he would cut it oil when
the corn was harvested. “Women. at least
Ihu Women of Topeka. do nol care lor a
man's bearded chin." he thought slleiitly to
himsull.

I'lu knelt before his bed and prayed.

“Father. the corn is well past my forehead
now. I'll be thinking about calling for some
hands Cullil.’ the end ol August. And
mother. I was thinking nl you tonight. It
hurts so much in inlss you. But you keep
reminding IllL’. Remind Illt’ so I'll never
lorgct you. Good night."

Brlngham stood and removed his
coveralls. laying them on his dressing chair.
l'le climbed kilo his bed and stared at the
héams ol the ceiling. The pillow was warm
still so he turned it over to the cooler side.
curled himself into a ball and tell soundly
asleep. .
