continued [mm 100

words. He thought about his own small
grandchildren. and he began to form a men-
tal picture of a boy, playing in a yard. The
boy was throwing a ball into the air. which
rose and fell in slow motion. The ball was
about to land in the boy's hand after a throw.
when all of a sudden the picture changed. It
focused on a man. who came running
through the yard toward the boy. When the
man had caught up with the boy. he stole the
ball. and started to run away with it. The
child pursued the man in playful delight. The
Inertial picture seemed to be accompanied
by narration. which sounded liku a whisper
ovur the wry distinct visual.
“You know what I think. Mr. McNalr? As
a child gets older. he forgets what it's like to

be a child. and hu tries to rciticmbor' again.
But it's very difficult to remember the simple
things that make up the minds of little boys

and girls."

The man and boy in Bill's mental picture
were still running. and their speed increased
as they ran farther and farther in the yard,
They SL'L’ITiL'fI to be aging rapidly with each

new step.

“But by the time a Ill-'Ill regains an
urulursttrnding oi the child's mind. it's too
late to do anything about it. So he's stuck
Wllll the body of an old man and thI mind of

a child,"

The man in Bill's menial pit’luru had now
gotten to tho point of regression. He had
become a little boy, and tlu.‘ little boy had
consequently grown to midillt' ago. Thu
now-inlddlu-aged man grahbr'd the ball
away from tho now-little boy. and he ran
with it. The little boy bégan to cry hysterical-

ly. Water ovorllowcd in his eyes. and blurred
his vision.

“And the child has it just as bad. because

ur..il he's an old titan. hu'll never know what
It's like to really crave your childhood again.
He's so busy trying to plt'rtst’ hiinsuli that he
can't ern thinlt of understanding old men."

which lay on the shout ol his hospital bed.
llls uyus lull the wall and instead began to
obsurvu his chapped. callousurl hands. l'lu
thought of how they used to stroke the hair
ol his son and the check of his wife. Now his
hands helped to support him in a room full
of dirty bt'tlprins. lifeless sturllily. luar-slaiiu'd
tissues. crt-uky hospital hurls. and n sunsilivu
old man: an old man with whom liill had
nothing and everything in. common.

Bill looked up and gazed into the mirror.

The picture reappeared in his I't'llUt‘lltlll. and
the middle-aged man was still running from
the crying child . . ,

The little boy's lugs llnilud wildly in the tall

mandalory student activity fee.

NYPIRG is a private group that does not
represent all students not does it represent
just students. 1 believe it is wrong to fund
one private political group and not others
with a mandatory fee. if we must fund
NYPIRG then we should fund other
political groups. such as the Moral Majori-
ty. which also has suppOrters on campus.
We must fund all viable groups or none to
be fair.

1f funding is optional to NYPIRG. then
it will be more responsive to the needs and
concerns of students. as its funding will dc-
pcnd on it.

A better way to fund NYPIRG would be
to allow students to use the optional check-
off on the bursor payment form. This
would allow students the freedom of chOiCL‘
to fund NYPIRG. just as students can give
contributions to their class or to 5-quud tim-
bulancc. This method of funding would not
infringe on the rights of sturlcnts who do
ttol support the issues that NYPIRG
represents.

I hope that students will exercise their op-
tion to protect their freedom of choice and
allow other students to do the some. The
only way to do this is to vote NO on the

NYPIRG referendum.

Funding Dilemma

T0 the Editor:

This week students have the opportunity
to vote on the NYl’lRG referendum for
allocation of funding from the Student
Association. Many students are not aware
that NYPlRG. an independent political
organization. rcccivcs $4.00 per year out of
every student activity fee (the fee is intui-
dittory for all full-time undergrads). i feel
that individqu students should be the onus
that make the decision as to give money to
NYPIRG or not.

Students should decide for themselves
whether they wish to contribute to this
political organization just as they have ibc
option to contribute to any other political
group.

If NYPlRG. who call ilrcinsclvcs chiim~
pious of student rights. are truly worthy of
their own praise then they should have no
problem getting students to voluntarily cou-
lrihutc to their cause. Optional funding
would also make NYPIRG more accoun-
table to students' interest because their fitn-
ding would not be guaranteed. Consider-
lng the fact that NYPlRG is a political
Organization. I believe that this would be it
Very healthy attiludc for them to bow.

It may be argued that students will try to
get away with the benefits of NYI’iRG and
find it a worthwhile organization will not
(tuibblc with a $4 charge on a $1.1XX).t)()lui~
lion‘bill. Class dues. for example. art- an
optional fee which most students prry.

lam not saying that NYl’lRG should not
be funded at oil. but only that the money
should be an opiioniil fcc lllltl noi part 0f
the mandatory student activity fee. 1 would
Urge all students to Vote NO on the
NYI’IRG rcfcrcuduni this week.

We are speaking of our most precious cum-

Congressmen and women need to hear
from citizens who are concerned about the
loss of programs and opportunities for our
youngslcrs. While the proposed federal
budget reduces other areas of government
by rougiuly seven percent. the proscd
budget would reduce school ‘ncnding by
nearly 30 percent. For New -.)rk Slate
alone. the cuts to schools represent ovcr
$657 million. The burden of replacing pro-
grams will be picked up by local and state
taxes or the needs of children will simply go
unmet.

It is one thing to bring federal spending
under control; it is quite another thing to
turn away from the needs of millions of
children. It is also fulsc economics to reduce
federal spcnding on schools by 30 percent
and shift lllL‘ replacement burden to looul
homeowners who pay school taxes.

Telethon Leaders

To the Editor:

it is rightly supposcd that the leadership
in SUNY‘s proud fund raising organiza-
tion. 'l‘clcllron. would be characterized by
discretion and superiorin in judgment.
rind considerate, balanced decisions fret.-
front licll‘ish political concerns. it is unfor-
luniilc that we have been proven wrong in
these assumptions. We take no pleasure in
disclosing the unlboughtful stud damaging,
behavior of llu: appointed leaders of
Telethon ‘81.

it is the highest form of cgotism for a
lcadcr to believe the system good because it
got him the position. Another form of
cgolism is to believe that since he is in the
position ho is wise. And yet another form:
since he is \visc. as evidenced by his posi-
tion. hr: is cttprtblc of making the best deci-
sion us to who should bl: lliL‘ ncxt lcudcr. It
is simply arrogance and irresponsibility for
it leader to state that he does not have to
answer to those to whom he was appointed
to lead.

We feel that our best interests have been
betrayed by llir: careless and disrespectful
appointment of the next loaders. not
specifically by who was chosen. for we have
no doubts us to their abilities. but by who
specifically was not chosen. it is our intent.
its former staff members. to appeal the doc-
sion to at body of laws which govern the
procedures of non-profit organizations and
which \vct'c designed in order to eliminate
such scandalous ahuscs.

Wc propose on election be called CllllL‘l' to
confirm our lcatdcrs' appointments. or to
alter them. not ill iuiotlicr‘s expense. but as
the proper rcwurd for hard work and
tttlculcd Ictlduislrip.

Election Blues

The election this year has been a sham. It has been marked by
poor scheduling, confusion and lack of participation.

Straddling the campaign over a holiday weekend has caused a
very awkward election. Candidates were given only two days
while school was in session to campaign and because of this they
were only able to reach a limited number of students. .

Confusion at the polls has taken its toll. People manning the
polling station yesterday in the Campus Center were unfamiliar
with the election procedure and turned eligible voters away. And
if you did get a chance to vote. you needed an atlas to figure out
which lever corresponded to which choice.

Although these problems have proven detrimental to the elec-
tion. they are by no means excuses not to vote. The issues at stake
are too important to ignore. Both the outcome of each of the
three rcfcrcnda and the SA officers elected will affect the life of
every student attending SUNYA. ‘

if you have not yet voted. find the time this afternoon to do so.
if you have already voted. try to convince others to vote.

This is your chance to show your pleasure or displeasure at the
way things have been done in this and past years. Don’t fall into
the trap of thinking that by not voting you are expressing your
dissatisfaction with student government. Your failure to vote on—
ly shows that you would not take the time to go to the polls. and
docs not express approval or disapproval.

if in the end you decide not to vote, that is your own decision.
However. if next year something bothers you, don't feel that you
have any right to complain. You don‘t.
