Tuition Hike
continued from front page
the board of trustees before we get
it, what is the need for the
legislature?" askcd Assembly Ways
and Means Committee Chair Ar-
thur Drcmcr (D-Long Beach) at
SUNY's budget hearing in March.

Legislators criticized the hike
because they felt the board of
trustccs curcumvcntcd the
legislature in negotiating the budget
with the governor's Office of
Management and Bridget without
first consulting the legislature.

Students also felt that thc
chancellor and the board's movc
was not in the best interests of the
students.

"Rather than responding to the
studcnrs, faculty and lcgislitlors,"
snitl SASU Vicc President llrucc

 

Cronin.
cumvontcd his consitucnts to draw
up the SUNY budget." ‘
Wharton, however, insists that
the board of trustees felt it was bet-
ter to try to meet the critical needs

“Wharton has cir.

of the university before the
legislature received the budget.

“In their judgement it was im-
portant to raise the tuition before
the legislature acted."

Wharton added that in this way
the board avoided program rctrcn-
chmcnts which could have resulted
if the lcgixluturc had not rcstorcd
enough money to SUNY's budget.

SUNY llortrd of Trustccs Chair
Donald Illinkcn said that although
thc hikc was “unpleasant” it avoid-
cd SOIIIL‘ 40] faculty and staff

Albany Student Press
Responding to accusations from
student groups'that the board of
trustees has not been responsible to
the needs of the students, Wharton
said "the belief that the board of
trustees is insensitch to students is
Incorrect because they have worked
hard to keep the cost of tuition
down."

Wharton added that SUNY
enrollment surveys show that tltc cf-
fcct the bike will have on the
students will “not be that great,”
despite claims from SASU and
othcr student groups to thc corr-
trary.

Along with the tuition hikc, the
dormitory raics will bc incrcnscd
$150. Thc tuition and dormitory
hikcs will bring the cost of illicit-
ding SUNY full-time to $4,000 It
ycnr including t'ccs, bunks and
transportation.

continued from page seven -

NASA will be sending Vonnegut
and his colleagues information on
how Mission Control operates. Ap-
proximately onc month before the
blast-off date, which Is still not
firm. they will be asked to visit Mis-
sion Control and take part in
simulated flight tests. Vonnegut cx-
pccts the flight to occur in
September or October.

Approxinratcly six months ago
the group gave a tutorial to Truly
and Englc and the simulated ﬂights
will allow the astronauts to become
familiar with problems that may
arise with the apparatus, and will
allow Vonnegut and his colleagues
to bccomc familiar with Mission
Control.

“Vaughan and I will have to bc
on duty in Mission Control during

ncgnl SillLI. “We‘ll be in touch with

ATTENTION
NATIONAL DIRECT STUDENT
LOAN RECIPIENTS

If you were awarded a National Direct Student
Loan for the Spring 1981 session and have not
yet signed your promissory note, you MUST do
so by May 12, 1981 or your money will be
returned. The Office of Student Accounts is
Open Monday through Friday from 9am to 4pm
and Is located in the basement ()I the Business
Administration building through the double

{Peta-Turheen '

which they will use to alert the
astronauts to good photo sites.

In performing the tape and audio
recordings, the astronauts will have
to prepare the camera and point it
out the shuttle window toward the
lightning area. Lightning will be
easily visible to them on the dark
side of the earth. An earplug to the
audio recorder will allow the
astronauts to hear the audio
“static” so they can identify lightn-
ing which will not be readily visible
on the bright side of the earth.

Vonnegut has requested that the
experiment be flown repeatedly on
subsequent ﬂights. It is not com-
plicated or expensive, nor docs it
take much time. NASA will res-
pond seeing the camera's first per-
formancc.

Advisement

:onrirmed from page [limo
dcnt. Tltc student has to ptrt himself
togcthcr bcforc thc advisement
system can rnakc a good impact.
“Thc university has to reach out
and be there. but it's very difficult
to advise a student who hasn't
decided to be advised." Voikwcin
continued. “I’d say the respon-
sibility Iics 60-40 to tire student.“
“A lot of students bclicvc wc arc
hcrc to save them." Schwartz cx-
pluincd. “Thcy have an obligation
to know the rules. Sornc bccomc
conveniently ignorant. We can‘t
control that. You‘ve got to bc
street-smart too.” he said.
Schwartz. Dcsfosscs, and Volk-
wcin all agree that advisement has
improved greatly since I978. They
recognize. too, that things still need
to bc donc.
“I‘d say we're doing a decent
job," Schwartz said. "Maybe not a
great job. but we‘re improving."
