inconsistency has been the theme
of the 1981 Albany lacrosse season
and the last week has not been any
different. The Danes dropped three
of four contests, losing to Cortland.
Gerrcsco and RP] while defeating
the University of Vermont Wednes-
day afternoon.

Monday against RP]. the Danes
played a good squad evenly in the
first half and were trailing only 8-4
at the midpoint.

The second half was a totally dif-
ferent story. Alharry could not con—
trol penalty siluations and RPI
started fast breaking for some quick
goals. When the dust cleared Rl’l
was on top 15-6 and Albany had
itself another loss.

“We performed well in the first
half. then we played no fundamen-
tal brrll — catching. throwing and
getting ground balls, and we
basically just couldn’t clear the
hall." stated Albany varsity

lacrosse coach Mike Motta.

Kenny DaRos played a good of-
fensive game as he scored the hat
trick recording three goals in the
contest. Mike Slocum, Glen
Magrane and John Nelson each ad-
dcd one goal. lint these tallies were
far from enough as Rl’l scored on
six power plays which led tlrctn to a
triumph over the inexperienced
Danes.

\K’edrresday against the Universi»
ty of Vermont it was a different
story. [)cspitc playing \sith fi\c in-
jrrrcd players. including attackrnan
Dave l’atrsl and midfielder Slocum
who had a had knee. the Danes
recorded their first victory after
lluee straight losses, HA7.

At the half. Albany was leading
slirnly, 4-3. In the third period, Ver-
tnorrt took advantage of Albany
penalties to score two goals.

"The period was one corrtirnutl
fast break and Vermont took better
advantage of the situation." added

With six minutes remaining in the
game the Danes found themselves
down 6-4. Tlrey knew they had a
job to do if they wanted victory and
the Danes quickly cut away at the
Vermont lead. it payed off and with
1:20 remaining Magrane slammed
in the fourth goal of the period and
Albany found itself a victory.

“We played three good periods
of lacrosse against a Division 1
team," praised Motta.

in the win. 'DaRos recorded two
more goals. Nelson scored two and
added an assist. Luke Esposito and
Slocum each had a tally.

Against Cortland and Genesco
the Darre's inexperience and youth
showed through. At Cortland, the
Danes played a respectable first half
moving the ball well and were trail-
ing 53. Tire second half proved to

be a different game as Cortland

 

outscored Albany 10-2 in gliding'to
a 15-6 romping. V

in the contest with Oeneseo the
match was decided on four quick
goals by the opposition in the third
period. The margin was too great to
overcome and Geneseo came up on
top 9-6.

“We played well at times, but we
looked very shaky on penalty
situations where we were a man
down." Motta said. “Our 3-5
record is due mainly to little ex-
perience, youth and lack of conCCn-
tration."
