Women’s Softball Team Gets Off to Flying Start

by Phil PIvnick

Albany's women’s softball team
got off to a flying start this spring
by winning six of their first eight
games. “This is the most skilled
team l’ve coached, we’ve got a lot
of depth which enables us to pinch-
hit a lot and maneuver my
defense," said an enthusiastic
coach Lee Rhenish.

On-Tuesday. the girls swept a
doubleheader from RPl, winning
the first game 10-1. and taking the
riiglltcap l9-ll. “in the ﬁrst game
we played super, we didn't commit
an error and Lynn Truss pitched a
great game," said second baseman
and captain Kathy Curatolo. Truss
helped her own cause with a tllrec
run homer. She hurled a great game
not allowing a single walk. Trudi
Eisaman paced the Dane 1"‘ack

with three hits.

‘ in the second game the Danes
found themselves trailing ll-4 going
to the bottom of the sixth. in that
inning the Danes sent 20 batters to
the plate and when it was all over,
15 runs had scored. The outburst
was highlighted by a bases-loaded
triple by Truss: Truss was the winn-
ing pitcher in the second game pit-
ching in relief of Cathy Meyers.
Cathy Briggs, Lori Blrggs, Nancy
Halloran and Eisaman each col-
Iectcd two hits in the nightcap.

Before the vacation tile girls top-
pcd Onconta 7-4. Truss, again was
the winning pitcher in the first game
of a scheduled doubleheader. The
second game was postponed due to
the extreme cold. Carol Wallace
and Cathy Briggs each pounded two
hits to key the Dane charge. Other

"Wage Nineteen

Women 'Netters Lose Two Times

by Robin Brown

Unable to maintain the momen-
tum from their previous wins.
against Binghamton, the Albany
State women's tennis team recently
added two losses to their spring pur-
suits bringing their season record to
l-2. Coach Peggy Mann remains
optimistic however. "The women
are playing very good tennis. Their
competition is really tough,“ site
said. "We need some fine weather
so that we can practice regularly
without the interferences of the
rain."

Wednesday afternoon the women
traveled to Vassar where they were
defeated 5-4. Junior Anltc Newman
was the sole singles champion for
the Danes. Site won her match
against Pam Thompson, 7-5, 6-2.

Unfortunately Newman's team.
mates were unable to be victorious
ill their own efforts. Nurtlbcr one
singles player Nancy Light was
downed, 7-5, 6-0 by Moira Bowdcn
who Light has beaten ill the past.
Junior Karen O‘Conncr. freshman
Pant Duchin and sophomore Elise
Solomon all lost their singles cont-
pctition, 6-3, 6-2, 62, 6-l. and 6-3.
6-3 respectively. And senior captain

fort of the season having been out
with a pulled shoulder, bowed 6-2,
6-0 to Valcrie Martinez.

All three Albany doubles teams
emerged triumphant over the
Poughkeepsic duet squads. Dane
partllcrs .loan Phillips and Amy
Feinberg won. 6-l, 7-5 against their
competitors Paige and Breslan.
“Amy and i played well against
'Vassar." said Phillips. “We need to
practice more together before the
Seven Sisters tournantcnt this
weekend."

Nancy Levine and Lauren isaacs,
despite gettingy off to a slow start,
managed to overcome Houlahan
and Norva front Vassar. 4-6, 6-3,
6-3.

“I was pleased with the way Ntln- .

cy and Lauren played.“ Mallrl rav-
cd. "They've never played together
as doubles partners and l‘m glad
they did so well."

The most “interesting” matcll of
the day, according to Mann.

(because of the underlying cir-
cumstanecs) involved Sandra Bor-
relle and Chris Rogers who manag-
ed a 3-6. 6-4. 6-0 success over
Plunkctt and Benton from Vassar.

“Sandra left her racquet at home
after the long weekend. explained
Mann. "She started out playing
with someone else’s racquet which
has a different grip than she is used
to. After losing the ﬁrst set. and
starting second set play. her father
arrived in the knick of time from
Hudson and brought her her own
racquet." The racquet made all the
difference and the Dane duet cap-
tured the match.

Prior to the Vassar challenge. the
women hosted a strong West Point
crew Wednesday April is at
Capitaland Racquet Club because
of rain. The home team suffered a
5-2 loss against the Cadets despite
the fauliliar territory.

“We always wanted to beat
them," said Light. "They're the
toughest team we go up against. We
did the best we could but unfor’
tunatcly it wasn't good enough to
wilt."

Playing against Monique
Thevemet of West Point, “an ex-
cellent player." said Mann, “who
beat liowden from Vassar," Light
was defeated 6-l, 6-1.

Then second seeded singles
player. freshman Cari Solomon.
who since has left the team for per-
sonal reasons, turned in one of the
two wins of the day upsetting Gayle
Petty, 6-3, 6-7. 6-4. Duchin.
Feinberg. and Elise Solomon rank-
ed among the defeated Danes
against their West Point rivals and
i went down, 6-2, 6-2 to Tia Sargent,
7-5, 6-2 against Bonnie Epstein and

7-5. 5-7. 6-4 to Deborah Williams.
respectively. -

The Albany doubles matches
were split with the number one team
of Light and Phillips being over-
taken by Thevemet and Sargent.
6—4, 6-l and the second squad of
O'Connor and lsaacs mastering
Cathy Spaulding and Sue Cook,
6-3. 7-5. “West Point is a powerful
team." said Mann. “Repeats were
played which we don't usually prac-
tice. i like to see all the women play.
it was a long hard day.”

Looking forward to the Seven
Sisters tournament this weekend at
Mt. Holyokc, Mann realizes that
