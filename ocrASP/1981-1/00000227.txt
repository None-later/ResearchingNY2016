Albany Netmen Win Notches 100th For Lewis

by Bob Bellaflore

The task was simple. All the
Albany men's tennis team had to do
was win once more, and coach Bob
Lewis would have his 100th career
victory. Last week, a better‘
prepared Middlebury team delayed
the milestone, but when Union

came to the Dutch Quad courts
Tuesday, nothing was getting in
Albany’s way -— not the icy-cold
wind and the near-freezing condi-
tions, and certainly not the Union
tennis team.

Carrying out the task ended up

simpler than Lewis thought. The
Danes completely dominated their
fees from Schenectady by taking all
nine matches — most of them with
comforting ease.

Albany won three of the six
singles contests in straight sets, and
won the first set in all but one. And
in the other three pairings, the
nctmcn had no trouble getting the
third. When it was time to play
doubles, Albany already had the
match clinched but did not let up.
and hreczed through to complete

the shutout.

Third singles player Rob Karen
had the easiest day of all in beating
Tom Lestena by successive 6-2
.scores. Number two man Fred
Gaber had a similar lack of difficul-
ty and did away with Dwight Moore
in straight 6-3 sets. Fifth player An-
dy Diamond squeaked by in the
ﬁrst set (7—6) to slam the door shut
on Union’s Steve Eskanazi in the sc-
cond. 6-2.

in the contests that went the
distance, Albany always recovered.
Dave Ulrich rttadc tltc best cont-

eback. After losing the opening set
to John Antiles, 4-6. Ulrich
manhandled him, 6-3. 6-1 to win.

Top Albany player Barry Levine
sandwiched a 4-6 loss to Barry
Rosenberg between 6-2 and 6-1
wins. Russ Kasow. playing in the
sixth slot. took the first set over
Dave Katz, 6-2. Katz rebounded for
a 6-] win itt the middle set, but
Kasow efficiently squashed his
hopes with another 6-2 victory in
the final set.

and Dave Lerner all won their pro-
sct matches by 8-4 scores.

Strong winds and cold weather
do not make for top-notch tennis.
but Albany overcame the condi-
tions in classic style. While the
Dane netmen may not have played
to the best of their ability, they cer-
tainly performed well enough to
win.

“Whenever you have a cold and
windy day. it's hard to play well,"
Lewis said. “But you have to adjust
to the weather. and i think ottt guys
adjust really well.

“I think we're just a better learn
than Union." he corttirtued. “i
figured we'd beat them. bill I
wasn't sure if we‘d sweep all the
singles."

Last week though. tltc rtcttttctt
lutd trouble adjusting to four
straight dttys witltotrt practice, and
fell to it trrlcntcd Midtllcbury tctnn,
6-3. Albany's ottly wins came off
the rncqucts of Karen irt third
singles. Kasow irt sixth singles. and
frotn thc combittctl efforts of
Levine tt'nd Gather irt first doubles.

“l'd liked to have played tltctn
when we were it little sharper." said
Lewis, without taking anything
away from Middlcbttry. “We were
rtot rnntclt-tottgh for them."

The nctmen take their 5-2 record
to Cornell today, bttt are back
home tomorrow to face conference
rival Binghamtort. The Colonials
wcrc second to the Danes in the
SUNYAC's last full by a solitary
point, and Lewis expects a similarly
close contest tomorrow.

Action starts at noon on the
Dutch Quad courts, and Lewis
hopes to start working on his sc-
cond hundred.

keel Gets Win Number 200; Danes Get Eighth

by Larry Kahn
The Albany State baseball team
went ittto RPl last Thursday look-

tng 'to reach two milestones.
but they had to put one on
hold. However, the Danes still ~

botnbcd hard-hitting RPl. I6-12.

The win was Albany's sixth
straight, extending their spring
record to 8-], and also marked Rick
Skcel's 2001b career victory as a
couch. Skccl has coaclted at Albany
for only a year and a half, collecting
most of his 200 wins and 70 losses at
Heidelberg College irt Ohio.

“it‘s nice to achieve that kind of
milestone," Skccl said. “but this
win doesn't mean as tnuclt to tire as '
it meant to the kids to be 8-1 and to
beat a good RPl ballciub."

Albany starting pitcher Mike
Esposito went into the game look-
ing for a milestone of his own, but
he came up short. The Dane acc
tied the Albany record for most
wins in a season when he picked up
his seventh against Binghamton last
week (he was 5-2 in the fall), but
couldno't survive the fifth inning
against RPl after being shellackcd
for eleven runs by the Engineers.

“The umps were not giving Mike
much on the corners," Skcel noted. '
“His curvebali has to be on the cor-
nets to be effective."

Ron Massaroni picked up the win
with a very good relief stint for his

‘third victory of the spring season,

tops on the team. against one loss.

Mnssttroni entered the game with
Albany down, li-it), but held the
RH offense to one run. while the
torrid Dane butters exploded for six
more of their own.

Albany rapped l6 hits ot‘t‘ RPl‘s
two top ltnrlcrs. Matt Antnlck led
the Albany attack, rcnching base all
\ix times he was at but with tltrce
hits and two walks. as well as being
ltit by it pitch. Bruce Rowlands con-
tributed four hits and Bob Arcario
nttd Jim Lynch also stood ottt.

“livcrybody just hit the heck out
of the ball." said Skccl. and itc also
noch that tile Danes took cotttrol
when they knocked Rl’l's ttcc ottt
of the box itt the fifth and con-
tirtned to pound tltc btrllpcrt.

“It was like pouring kerosene on
a fire." lie said. “We just went
crazy after that."

Albany‘s offensive attack was
ttevcr stronger, bttt the defense lcft
something to be desired, allowing
eigltt unearned rrtns to let the
Engineers stay in the gatnc. Crucial
errors like misjudged liy balls were
committed on routine plays that
should have gotten the Danes out of
big innings.

Albany meets Colgate tomorrow
afternoon at home in a
doubleheader. The first game
begins at 1:00.

“We know we’re playing good
baseball," said Skeet, “and we're
going to go out and keep knocking
heads together."

ROTC to Locate at SUNYA

 

Several Campus Groups Protest

by Susan Mllllgun

An ROTC “extension center
agreement“ has been approved by
President Vincent O'Leary to allow
SUNYA students enrolled in the
program to attend ROTC classes at
SUNYA, according to Vice Presi-
dent of University Affairs Lewis
Welclt.

“What it involves is that cortrscs
prcsctttly givctt at chsselacr
Polytechnic lnstittrtc (RPl) -- for
which SUNYA students had to
travel to Rl’l -- will rtow be offered
on campus." ltc said.

Welclt said that the proposal was
reviewed and approved by the
Educational Policy Council (EPC)
of the University Senate. the ex-
cctttive board of the University
Senate, and ultimately O'Lcary.

The Senate as a whole did not vote
on the plan.

Ot‘f Campus Association (OCA)
Director Mark Danica said he
believes the intention of this
redistricting is to split student votes.
McEncny‘s proposal follows a re-
cent court decision giving Albany
stttdcnts the rigltt to vote in their
college communities.

McEncny. ltowcver, denies
Dunlca's allegations. “The ward
lines were primarily dctcrmitted by
traditional neighborhoods," said
McEncny.

“Students are historically split in—
to several wards because of the
location of the old SUNY campus
and the rotttc ol' the SUNY bus
litre." explained McEneny.

One reason cited by McEncny for
tire redistricting is that Albany has
seen rt population redrtctiott of
H.000.

“The redistricting is necessary to
maintain the one man-one vote cott-
cept outlined by the Suprerttc
Court." said McEncny.

McEncny added that the
redistricting would have been
necessary even if there wasn‘t a
population loss because of the
tremendous shift itr population.

According to McEneny, many
people itavc rrtovcti out of the
Sonthend district of Albany.

This has resttltcd itt the merging
of three wards ituo anew ward. pit-
ting the only two black aldermcn in
the city against each other in the
next clectiort.

Dunletr questioned the methods
used in detertninirtg the new wards.
and said that tlterc is some con-
troversy as to the determination of
tire newly created Ward l4.

The estimated rtttrttber of voters
in this area is 7.200, said Dunlcu.
He claimed. however, that the tit:-
tual number of voters on the SUNY
rtptowrt campus \‘iis trndercounted.

McEneny slttlcd that the number
of voters on the uptown catnpus
was courttcd at 3.400 by the last
census.

McEneny is also in charge of con-
ducting the census for Albany.
