The body is a functional
organism. Muscles and joints were
designed to move and our car-

  

ball). another individual (e.g. con-
tact sports like football), or your
own body weight (e.g. gymnastics).

Out of all the factors of human
performance. strength is the only
one that does any actual work and.
unfortunately. is probably the least
understood and the most feared by
a large percentage of individuals in
relation to their sport performance.
An individualized program of pro-

diorespiratory system was designed gressive resistance that involves all

to function at certain levels.
Technological advancements in our
society have reduced the respon-
sibility of our bodies in this capaci-
ty. As a result. the efficiency of our
physical parameters such as
strength. ﬂexibility and cardio-
respiratory ﬁtness to maintain the
quality of life or to meet emergency
situations has been severely af-
fected. Continued inactivity also
makes the body susceptible to cer-
tain conditions wlticlr are direct
causes or major contributing fac-
tors to illness. Obesity and its rcltt‘
tiorrslrip to heart disease is a prime
example.

Strength. ﬂexibility. and car-
diovascular efficiency. which are
the three major physical
parameters. will all increase with a
well designed and irrrplenrented cs-
ercise program. Strength is the

major mttscle groups of the body
can improve not only the muscles‘
basic ability to contract. but can in-
crease ﬂexibility. speed. power. and
cardiovascular efficiency as well.
Recent studies at the U.S.
Military Academy have shown con-
clusively that high intensity strength
training done properly will result in
lower heart rates at various exercise
workload levels. ability to sustain
workloads longer. and a lower two-
mile rtrrr time for subjects tested.
These resttlts were in addition to
basic improvements in strength as a
result of the weight training.
Flexibility ,is all important

fitness. Our rmrscles and joints were

range. and luck of this movement

heels) shorten speciﬁc muscles and
decreases their ﬂexibility. As a
result. the joint involved becomes
less functional in a performance
situation, and more susceptable to
injury. Muscle groups on the
posterior portion of the lower body
(hamstrings and gastrochimius) are
extremely susceptablc to the condi-
tion defined above and should be
concentrated on in most stretching
programs.

All stretching should be slow and
steady and held at a maximum
point for a total of rs to 20 seconds.
A stretching routine should work in
the major muscles that will be in-
volved in a specific activity in addi-
tion to the two groups mentioned
previously.

Flexibility is a characteristic that
can be vastly improved with very lit-
tle effort. Programs designed to in-
crease flexibility cart serve as a
warm-up/down for a nrore
strenuous activity. or can be a
workout in itself. Proper strength
training can serve to increase flex-
ibility to a great degree because the
muscle stretches with increases of
weight. Decreasing the participants'
susceptability to injury. however. is
the most positive aspect of ﬂexibili-
ty training.

The ability of the body to
transport oxygen to the working
muscles and the trimmer in which
those muscles trtili/e that oxygen is
defined as ear'dio-vttsculur efficien-
cy. It is medically known that after
a program of exercise the resting
heart rate is lower; therefore. it has
to heal less to pump out the same
amount of blood. From this rela-
tionship. although it is not as simple
as stated. comes the theory that if

the system has to work at a lower
level of intensity. it will last longer
and be better able to handle
stressful situations whether they be
self-imposed or of emergency
nature.

As the rate of cardiovascular
disease increases (recent reports in-
dicate that cardiovascular disease
related deaths number one in every
three for the American public at the
rate of one per minute). concern
regarding its relationship to our
sedentary lifestyle is evident
through numerous longitudinal
studies. Although conclusive
evidence has not yet been found
proving that exercise will decrease
an individual's susceptability to
heart-attack. research seems to in-
dicate that exercise will decrease
several risk-factors (e.g. obesity.
high blood pressure. choles-
terol/trigliceride leVels and
stress).

Any activity that increases your
heart beat to a training level (60-90
percent of your maximum heart
rate) and is sustained for a prolong‘
ed period of time (I5 minutes or
greater) will serve to increase car-
diovascular efficiency. Jogging,
cycling. swimming. aerobic danc-
ing. roller skating. skiing, are all ex-
amples of this type of training. Tire
intensity as measured by the heart
rate. the duration of tinre that this
rate is sustained and the frequency
of the workouts (per week) are key
variables in designing an effective
program.

Physical activity of almost arty
nature is considered good preven-
tive medicine. Along with increases
in physical factors. the participants
will also beneﬁt from many side-

effects including decreased fatigue
(mental and physical) levels. injury
rates. and stress due to pressures
that are usually academic in nature.
Just pretend that your economics
book or professor is a racquetball.
whack It around for and hour or so.
and you'll feel just great.

Many students are, unfortunate-
ly. reluctant to embark on a ﬁtness
mission for several reasons. One is
that the only association they make
with anything physical is the letter
"p" for punishment. Although
ﬁtness is not an easily obtainable
commodity. it does not have to be
painful to the point that it scares the
participants away. For the most
part. any activity that increases the
heart rate. such as jogging. cycling.
raquetball and swimming. is good
for cardio-vascular efficiency. Sim-
ple stretching exercises will increase
flexibility. and there are several
state of the art machines that will
produce strength increases.

We are all creatures of habit.
These four years of your life are im-
portant in regard to habit setting
patterns. Now is the time to “make
time" for exercise. Don't use
classes and studyng as an excuse,
because it is a poor one. Take your
academic schedule and your study
schedule. block ottt eating and
sleeping periods. and I’m sure you
would find at least one or two hours
to devote to exercise.

As a result. yotr will definitely
look better. probably feel better.
maybe see a change in your
academic success and have some
negativevcalorie fun at the same
t’mc.
