Life in the U.S.S.R.

m

Saturday afternoon. A gorgeous white
birch forest. Delicious “shaslilik” ’on a
skewer. Beer and soda. A cool September
breeze blowing. Students throwing a frisbee
around while listening to cassette tapes of
the Cars and Neil Young. What a lifel

That was our welcome-to-the-U.S.S.R.
party that our student and faculty counter-
parts (most of whom were in Albany the
previous year) at the Moscow institute of
Foreign Languages organized in our honor
last autumn. This started off the l980—81.
seventh annual. SUNY-Moscow
undergraduate exchange program which i
and nine other SUNY students participated
tn.

My four-month stay in the U.S.S.R. was

a fabulous and unforgettable one. Our
group was in Moscow to study Russian in-
tensively at Moscow's institute of Foreign
Languages. the U.S.S.R.“s top foreign
language interpreter's and teacher's in-
stitute. Besides over 20 hours a week or so
of classroom instruction (in Russian). we
were scheduled to take short and long
cultural excursions. Local excursions
around Moscow included fascinating tours
of the Kremlin. historical sites. art
museums. the theater. Our longer excur-
sions took us to picturesque Leningrad and
Kiev. and to ancient Vladimir and Suzdai.
150 miles east of Moscow.

in spite of tile hectic academic and
cultural program i still found plenty of titne
to get out on my own to explore. This
enabled me to become totally immersed in
Soviet life. to live as a Soviet lives.

1 ate in Soviet cafeterias and restaurants.
shopped in Soviet stores. used Moscow's cf-
ficicnt and inexpensive. but sometimes
crowded thus unnerving, public transit. All
of this involved being forced to constantly
speak and listen to Russian and see ﬁrsr-
hand just what the every day Soviet is like.

There was a great deal of exchanging of
ideas and opinions at the dormitory where
we all lived. Ottr dorm included not only
Soviet students but foreign students from
over 60 nations. in our somewhat decrepit,
but cozy. living quarters, our rootttmates
and neighbors helped us to cope with ottr
new and unfamiliar surroundings by mak-
ing us feel at home with their generosity,
hospitality and patience. which were way
beyond the normal call of duty.

1 was truly impressed by the wealth of
cultural and recreational resources that the
U.S.S.R. has to offer. But rather than
speak about each and every museum or play
or sports event that 1 attended, l’d like to
mention just a few of the more enjoyable
and unusual experiences that i personally
had.

i attended Mass on Christmas Eve in a
"working" (not a museum) Roman
Catholic Church in central Mascow. The
church was ﬁlled with young and old alike
while gorgeous holiday songs were being
sung in Latin and Russian.

Another memorable experience occurred
after prolonged applause and fifteen cur-
tain calls at a major Moscow theater's
"Swan Lake" ballet performance. l and the
few dozen other people remaining and still
applauding were invited backstage to meet
the' performers. What a thrill that was!

When one of the four other SUNY
students and l were clowning around in the
Moscow subway. a cute little boy and his
grandmother started to excltange smiles and
laughs with us. Finally. my companion of-
fered titem some "Wriglcy’s Gum."
Needless to say. they genuinely appreciated
it. The point is. it really was possible to
make friends with Soviets on the streets artd
irt the subway . . . and it was a lot of fun.

Of course. i missed the United States
durittg my stay, especially on ltolidays. and
fricnds' and relatives’ birthdays. However.
getting letters from hontc, reading
“Newsweek” once in a while at our Em-
bassy, watching the Carter-Regan debates;
Barbara Walters and all. on videotape at
the US. Ambassador's Residence. arid
even drinking Soviet "Pepsi" and “Fanta”
helped to bring home that tnttcit closer.

Perhaps it seems that l‘m eliminating the
unpleasantnesses there (which certainly do
exist itt varying degrees). 1 ant ttot denying
that they do exist. l artt ntercly discussing
particular experiences — cxpcriertccs which
are rarely brought to light. given the state of
affairs of East—West relations today. To be
sure. whether I was engaged in fierce
political arguments or enjoying a quiet cltat
with my Soviet friends after a delicious,
home-cooked meal. the common

‘dcnominutor was a felt common respect.

That respect is absolutely essential itt order

Waste Not

To the Editor:

"Big deall" “The carrots aren’t cooked
enoughl" “There's too much fat on the
roast beefl” For over three years. l’ve
heard these comments and other similar ra-
tionalizations regarding UAS cafeteria
food. Sure. everybody is entitled to com-
plain. protest and scream about the quality
of food that they eat. However. wasting it
not only hurts other people (indirectly) but
it by no means leads to improved food.

I've been a dishwasher on State Quad for
one and a half semesters now and i am
amazed at the amount of food that is
squandered. Half-eaten hamburgers and
grilled cheese minus one bite do add up. i
realize that this sounds extremely frugal and
to some people even ridiculous. but it‘s also
reality. There is a lot of edible food that is
unnecessarily wasted.

l'm sure that everybody has heard that X
percent of the world is starving and would
love to have the food that you reject. This
may be an ovar used and non-effective
statement to most people; it is nevertheless
true. Cutting down on the amount of UAS
food which is wasted most likely will not
alter the diet of any undernourished person
attywltcre else in the world. But this does
not mean that human beings should treat
food as if its supplies are infinite. Well off
people should not fail to realize what it
must feel like ttot to have a plentiful supply
of food.

 

develop. The fact that art American. their
supposed “enemy.” shows genuine interest
in their language. culture and opinions
enables them to feel comfortable. not
defensive. and to open up. just as l was able
to do. And we have a lot to learn from eaelt
other.

Just last week. i read about a study which
characterized the average American student
as grossly uninformed and unaware of tltc
international arena. These findings are very
uttfortunatc attd embarrassing. SUNY's
Moscow cxcltange program not only offers
a beginning. a start towards easittg interna-
tional tensions through mutual understan-
ding at a time when it is sorely needed. but
it gives the participant a cltattec to go where
the vast tnajority of Americans will never
go. and an opportunity to learn about a
totally alien system while looking at him or
herself and the United States in a different
light. objectively and intelligently. Now
that is truly a learning experience.

As long as i am stirring some consciences
(hopefully). i might as well throw in a bit of
additional ludicrous information. napkins
grow on trees. Some people must feel pretty
insecure about their abilities to control a
fork and spoon. They feel as though they
need a half dozen napkins or so to wipe
their faces clean. Hang out at the napkin
dispenser every once in a while and watch
people dig their thumbs in and come out
with a healthy wad of napkins that they
know they won't use.

Dishwashers literally take piles of these
unused napkins off of thetrays and throw
them away constantly. To those who it ap-
plies to: at least separate the pile of paper
and rearrange it on the tray to make it seem
as if they have been touched. Or better yet,
make a sculpture. All of you must know by
now that water and napkins make a fine
modeling material.

By no means do i want to tell anybody
ltow much to cat. That is not the object of
this letter. Rather i hope to awaken people
to the situation that does take place it) the
State Quad cafeteria and most likely in the
other school cafeterias as well. Opctt your
eyes. Look for yourself. Walk to the back
of tltc kitchen where the dishwashers fling
the non-eaten food attd wasted napkins into
the garbage disposal. Then maybe
(hopefully) you will understand what l‘m
saying. it does add up!

Special Thanks

To the Editor:

On behalf of New York Special Olym-
pics. Area 10. i would like to issttc a public
letter of thanks to the students and faculty
of the State University of New York at
Albany for an outstanding job dottc on the
recent benefit Telethon.

Area 10 Special Olympics was one of two
recipients of funds raised by this endeavor.
attd not denying tltc importance of the
monetary donation to our organization. I
feel that an equally important emotional
contribution was tttade as well.

Throughout the many ltours, days. weeks
and months of preparation for Telethon'Bl.
their purpose remained clear and unwaver-
ing: to help tltosc individuals who are han-
dicapped or otherwise disadvantaged.

Our special thanks to David Yokcl and
Sidonic Contino. chairpersons of Telethin
'81; to the committee volunteers. advisors.
fricttds attd parertts who stood behind their
efforts.

Our thanks. also. to Robitt Hirschman,
who chaired the Children‘s Hour Commit-
tee. The joy experienced by our athletes at
the parties was undeniable.

Not only have the students touched the
lives of tltcvnearly 1.000 Special Olympians
in Area l0 with their love. but also. they
have opened their hearts to tltc contitttting
needs of the mentally retarded.

The mentally retarded ltavc always been
told, I‘You can't do it." Special Olympics
says. “You can do it; all you need is a
chance."Telethon '81 has helped provide
that cltant‘; and we are sincerely grateful.

End Capitalism

To the Editor:

Not many university students know that
lit) years ago, on March 18. 1871. the
workers of Parks. l’rttnce struck a blow
nguittst cluss oppression that sent shock
waves around the world and provided a
profound inspiration for workers
everywhere.

What had been up to tltctt just another of
many rebellions of the oppressed turttcd in-
to a trttc revolution. the establishment of
the first worker's government in history.
the Paris Commune.

Witltout any vanguard party to lead them
and without any tyrant to direct their ac-
tions. the starving, utttraittcd. barely
literate. out-numbered and out-gunned
workers smashed the French capitalist state.
ran its army out of town and checked the

 

 

advance of the crack troops of a victorious
Prussian army.

For 63 days these brave people showed
that the collective genius and will of the
working class can take hold of its own
destiny and found a society free of tyranny.
want. and class rule.

The Socialist Labor Party celebrates this
great event every year as the Paris Com-
mune is a landmark in working class
history.

Private Party

To the Editor:

l'am upset and annoyed to see that
SUNYA has destroyed an old tradition. to
make room for a new one. i am referring to
the private party the University Concert
Board is throwing this year at the expense
of the university community. This year's
ticket policy is discriminatory and infringes
upon the rigltts of students as well as other
uttiversity personnel. UCB is assuming that
tltc only people who are entitled to use
university facilities not only possess tax
cards. but also have agreed to attend this
gala event.

What if a student chooses to decline this
invitation and not attend this Celebration
'8l? Should she be cttcottragcd to leave her
dorm room (as suggested) and itt tltc cvcrtt
she does. where should site go? What about
graduate students. contittuittg studies
students. and otitcr staff who frequent the
library and/or seek rcfttgc itt the campus
center for a break or fora bite to eat? is it
rigltt to deprive these people of tltcir rigltts
as part of the university and close down ccr-
taitt facilities or discourage tltent frottt fre-
quentittg tltesc facilities just because they
were not invited to this private party’!

There are more appropriate ways to
minimize costs. ensure safety and clean-up
artd prevent distress and disillusionment
among students. it is tttetttioncd in the an-
ttouncentettt by UCB that these changes
were implcmctttcd to help preserve a
SUNYA tradition. Yott can’t put a fence
around l'rce-spiritedness. or between stu-
dcttt get-togethers and alumni reunions;
change its name to Cclebratiott '81 and call
it preserving a tradition.

Clarification

To the Editor:

As secretary of State Quad Board. i feel
it is my duty to respond to some of the
points brought out by Mr. Steve Gerber in
his recent letters. "Quad Politics" and
“RA Warning.“

The first point is the case of Mr. Gerbcr's
selection as a member of Judicial Board. As
he states. “l was selected by a committee of
which Ms. Snyder was a member.” That is
just the point. Ms. Snyder was a montber of
that committee and witctlter sltc wanted
Mr. Gerber as a rtternbcr of the board or
ttot is ttot the question. it was a conttttittec
decision made like any other. Mr. Gerber
makes it seem as if Ms. Snyder is a dictator
who has total control over the cottttttittcc
that chooses Judicial Board members.

A second poittt i want to bring forth is
Mr. (icrbcr's statement that SA applica-
tions wcrc ttot opettcd because Ms. Snyder
didn't wattt someone to get tltc job. i pcr~
sonnlly wanted to apply for the position
when I learned there were vacancies.
However. I realized that since the SA staff
is ttot very large (there are norntally six). in
order to prcvcrtt the rernaittittg four SA's
front bcing overworked. the process would
be speedcd up by cottsidcrittg only those ap-
plications that had been received previous-
ly. it also seems to me that even if there had
been a rc-opening of applications. if so-
meone wasn’t wanted as an SA, all that
would have to be dotte would be not to
cltoosc that person.

The third. and final, point l'd like to

 

 

clarify is Mr. Gerber's section concerning

Ms. Snyder's “evasion” of a question
about the RA selection process. The ques-

tioner. who shall remain anonymous. asked
Ms. Snyder why she had promised that the
group interview would not be used for RA
selection this year and yet it was. Ms.
Snyder responded immediately that she had
not made such a promise. There was more
discussion about whether or not the pro-
mise had been made. At tltls point. the
president asked if the discussion was really
pertinent to the meeting at hand (a general
Quad Board meeting). Ms. Snyder then
agreed to talk to the questioner following
the meeting. That discussion occurred in
the Eastman TOWer Lower Lounge. where
any interested individual who had been at
the Quad Board meeting could have joined
or listened to what was being said.

Now. some may say that since i have

recently been appointed as an RA on State
Quad. i am trying to butter up my boss.
Ms. Snyder. by coming to her defense. On
the contrary. i feel that my past record
Shows my complete honesty and the fact
that I do not "kiss ass." i wrote this letter
to clarify some things that I felt might be
tnisconstrucd by a reader who does not
know all the facts about the above mention-
ed points.

Uncertain Past

To the Editor:

ltt accordance with the Domestic Rela-
tions Code of New York. art origittal birtlt
record is settled once an adoption is colit-
pletcd. This prevents the adult adoptce
from havittg legal access to ltcr biological
past unless she can demonstrate good
cause. ltt practice, this means tltc adoptcc
mttst be sttfferittg front a deep
psycltological problcnt. ltt defense of their
position, the courts talk of protecting
children in tlte adoption process. However.
do they realize that the adult aduplec is be-
ing slticidcd from ltersclf.

Durirtg adolescence. teenagers receive
varying jolts to their already fragilc iden-
tities. The question. “Who atn l?" is
especially jarring for the adoptcc. Althouglt
given a psychological idctttity by her adop-
tive parent(s). site often finds a void itt
ltcrsclf. At a stage when children are look-
ing ntore arid more like daddy. she cart only
wonder about physical links to the past.
Faces in crowds present infinite
possibilities. Often. questions about self are
internalized. only to resurface at wltat
might otherwise be a happy occasion.

The birth of a cltild may reactivate this
questioning. Normally friends and relatives
can‘t wait to find resemblances between the
ncwbortt attd grandma. Everyone wonders
when the child is the only fantin member.

hair. For tltc parent who is art adoptee. this
ettigtna is sometimes compounded later on
by a child's similar queries.

As an older person. the adoptcc may find
difficulty itt putting lter life ittto perspec-
tive. Aititough able to take pride in family
and achievements. cart site know her place

be different given hcr ttttccrtain past.

Perhaps the law maker should carefully
review his statutes. Or if lie is atnbitious,
should take a close look at the people af-
fected by his work. Most people want pro-
tection ttttdcr the law. 1101 protection front

reviewed. a distinction might be tttadc bet-
ween tltc adoptcc as a child and us an adult.

Out of Control

Let’s put aside all of our personal opinions for or against an
organized military group on campus. The issae has been debated
at many schools across the country. with emotions running high
in both directions.

Instead, let’s just get to the root of the problem: the recent
decision to allow ROTC on SUNYA’s campus. There are a lot of
things that bother us about this. -

For example, why was the decision to allow ROTC on campus
made so quietly? And why weren’t the students consulted or told?
Although it was reported to the University Senate. the surrep-
titious way in which it was done spurred no debate. How could an
issue which has caused so much controversy at other campuses be
railroaded right through? it seems to us that an issue of this im-
portance deserved a lot more scrutiny. '

in addition to the sneaky way it was passed through. there are
other problems. in the past. the army has shown outright
discrimination against homosexuals. The university’s new anti—
discrimirtation policy. however, clearly states that there cannot be
discrimination against someone because of his/her sexual
preference. if ROTC violates this, will the university stand
behind its own policy?

The university has also given ROTC carle blanche when it
comes to holding classes on campus. Tltcre will be no input from
or control by tltc university administration. Those itt charge of
the ROTC program will have the rigltt to teach, conduct classes
attd treat each student in any way they see fit. How can the
university relinquish its control to ROTC when it comes to
academic credit and use of our facilities? This sets a terrible
precedent.

While we don’t dctty a person the right to join such an
organization, we do question many things about its being at
SUNYA. These ‘questions need to be answered, for it is our
university and we must have a say in decisions which affect us.
