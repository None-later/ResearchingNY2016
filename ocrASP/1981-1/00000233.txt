Somach explained then that an
ROTC proposal must pass through
the Undergraduate Academic
Council (UAC) and the Educational
Policy Council of the Senate.
wherein suggestions and revisions
may be made, The Proposal then
goes to the University Senate. he
said, which would make a recom-
mendation to the President.
O’Leary makes the final decision.

However. the proposal was never
voted on by the University Senate as
a whole. and UAC Chair Dean
Snow said he “didn't know a thing
about it."

O'Lcary has the power to change
academic policy. and thus could ap-
prove the extension ccntcr agree-
ment without consulting the Senate.
Somach nolcd.

O'Lcury contends that the deci-
sion was not insidiously made.

"The proposal was made by the
EPC and reported to the Senate."
Itc said. “Any Senator can ask for
discussion. It was very openly and
carcfully done." He noted also that
thc EPC is comprised of bolli facul-
ty and siudcms.

O'Lcury sold the qucstionn regar-
ding ihc “academic” naturc of the
courscs was csscnlially dccidcd by
the EPC.

"III ilIcir view it was academic."
hc said. "Wc do not give credit for
military drills. The students will on-
ly rcccivc credit as they have been
for courses lukcn at Rl’l.

“Originally. the proposal was
Inndc so that our students would
not lirivc to lrrtvcl to RPI.“ hc ex-
plriincd.

O'Lcary channg the university's
anti-discrimination policy last year
to proltibit discrimination oli cam-
pus on tht: basis of sexual or affec-
tional prcfcrcncc. Asked if the
university policy and the Army's
historically anti-homosexual policy
would posc problems, O'Lcary said
"it would raisc an issuc in my
mind."
