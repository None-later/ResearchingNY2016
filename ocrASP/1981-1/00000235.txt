“Pant did remarkably well in-
doors ttgaittst Springfield," said
Albany women‘s tennis coach
Peggy Mann, “and continued to
play well utttil the woman from
Colby-Sawyer beat her In the con-
solation semi-ﬁnals."

The doubles squads from Albany
also split thcntselvcs between the
finals competition and the consola-
tion finals. Hard and O'Conncr
beat the duct from Barnard in three
sets, 6-2, 6-7, 6-2. Sunday they met
the ntttnbcr one 5ch from Skid-

Moving on to the consolation

"It was an exhausting weekend,"
said Mann, “but fun to watch.
Saturday it rained so we had to
drive an additional 18 ntiles . . .
where the women played indoors.
Later it cleared so we ended up back
at Mt. Holyokc for some late after-
noon outdoor play. The extra
traveling tinte was trying on
everyone and quite tiring but music
kept our spirits up. Sunday tltc skies
were clear so we played outdoors at
Mt. Holyokc. It was a good
weekend and the women played
some very good tennis.”

afternoon, but will be back in
Albany Saturday. hosting Concor-

’ din at 11:00 a.m. on the Dutclt
