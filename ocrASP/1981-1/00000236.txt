game for us," Rhcnish commented.

Albany. now boasting a strong
8-2 record. is in good position for a
bid in the New York State Cham-
pionships to be held May 8 and 9.
Ritcnish right now is waiting for the
word on that bid. noting that the
Danes have a better record than any
of the local area teams.

“I'm real pleased at the way their
playing together." Rhcnish said,
“and the progress that they've
made individually and collective-

With thc fourth quarter at hand.
Oswcgo was down six goals and
were forced to resort to a game con-
strued of sloppy ball-handling. The
Lakch were frustrated —-— playing
overly aggressive and taking poor
shots along with unenthusiastic
passing.

Oswcgo tried to rally latc, scoring
two quarter-ending goals. Both
goals were scored by Dan Head at
l0:07 and 12: l5. Albany goalie J.D.
McMahon came in at the end of the
game to replace Tlrman who had 15
SEVCS.

“They weren't ready to play.
They were supposed to be a better
team but they didn't move too well.
Thcir specialty teams hurt them.
but we moved the ball around real
well." said Molta.

Albany had 42 shots on goal.
“DaRos had an exceptionally good
day -— always ﬁring on goal. Our
extraman offense went well and we
cleared the bail successfully." Mot-
to said. The win keeps Albany(2-3)

The Dunes go on to Hartwlck for
a road game next Saturday in an cf-
fort to reach the .500 mark.
