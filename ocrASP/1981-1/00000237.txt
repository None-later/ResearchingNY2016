Danes Sweep Colgate as Esposito Gets Record

by Bob Bellatlore

As a rule. Division [11 teams are
not supposed to beat Division 1
teams.

So much for mles.

The Albany State varsity baseball
team won its eighth game in a row
and increased their already im-
pressive record to 10-1 by sweeping
a double-header over Division 1
Colgate. taking the first game 4-2
and coming from behind in the
night-cap, 3-2. Saturday afternoon.

Ace righthander Mike Esposito
got a complete game victory in the
opener for his third win of the spr-
ing (his eighth overall) and the all-
time Albany win mark. Ron

Masseroni also went the distance in

the night-cap and grabbed his
fourth win in five decisions.

The Danes wasted no time in get-
ting on the scoreboard in the first
game and did it with classic baseball
strategy. Leadoff hitter Bob Tor-
torello walked and stole second.
Center ﬁelder Matt Antalek follow-
ed with a sacrifice bunt. moving
Tortorello to third. After top Dane
hitter Bob Arcario (.432. 16-37) was
walked. number five hitter Frankie
Rivera singled Tortorello home.

in the second. Albany had
another run before Colgate could
get an out. Rigltt fielder Tom Verde
(2-5 for the day) doubled off the
bag at third base. Then designated

hitter Bobby Rhodes singled over
shortstop Ken Staats' head. and the
Danes led. 2-0.

Left ﬁelder Jim Lynch's first
home run of the season irt the
fourth inning gave Alhrtrty all tlte
runs they needed to clinch the wirt
for Esposito.

The Danes got one more irt rlte

sixth when Rhodes (2-3) doubled to
the right field corner. Designated
runner Steve Shucker went to third
on Colgate hurler .loe Spofford's
wild pitch. and came in on Lynch's
line single to center.

Colgate’s runs were all unearned.
They got one in the fifth when John
Kratley reached on a force play.
went to second on a perfect bunt
single by Jim March, and came in
when Rivera's throw to ﬁrst to first
trying to complete what would have
been an inning-ending double play
was too high for Bruce Rowlands to
handle. ‘

Their second tally came in the top
of the seventh inning. Kratley led
off with a single to right and went
to third when Antalek could not get
the handle on March's ensuing
single. A walk to Dan Trunﬁo load-
ed the bases. and Kratley scored
when Staats grounded out to se-
cond.

But the Danes got out ofthcjam
when Arcario snared .loe Murphy's
soft liner at third and stepped on
the bag for the game-ending double
play.

in the nigltt~cap. Albany went

out to art early lead again — this
time in the second inning. Red
Raider starter Carter Mann walked
Rowlands on fotrr pitches to lead
off. Rivera followed with a high fly
to rigltt that got caught irt the swirl-
ing wind. Trunin twisted and fell
while chasing. it. and the ball drop-
ped beltirtd him. By tlte time he got
the ball to the infield. Rowland
scored. and Rivera was parked on
third with tt stand-up triple.

Colgate tied it rrp irt the third. Se-
cortd baseman Dave Nttti singled
past third to lcad off. March tried

to bunt him over, but Masseroni's
throw pulled Rowlands off the bag
and both men were on. Kratley
struck out on three pitches. but
Staats singled to right and Nuti
scored.

Colgate went up 2-1 in the next
inning. Tortorello went deep in the
itole at shortstop to field Dave
Wolf's hard grounder. but his
throw was in the dirt. skipped by
Rowlands and Wolf took second.
Trunﬁo followed with an RBI
single up the middle.

"When We got behind 2-1. it
woke us up." said Albany baseball
coach Rick Skeel. .

The awakening became unplea-
sant for Colgate. anti Albany got
two runs in the fifth. Designated
ltitter Jerry Rosert walked, went to
second on an errant pickoff at-
tempt. movcd to third on Verdc's
single. and was awarded home on
Mann's balk.

Lynch brought Verde across the
plate with the winning run with his
third RBI hit of the day. Masseroni
retired the last six Colgate batters irt
order and contplcted the sweep on a
day not exactly made for baseball.

The free/ing cold artd riddlirtg
winds made it tough for the hitters
all day. Since the regular field was
in bad condition. the Danes played
on the J.V. field and had to face the
wind.
~ “If we had played on our field."
Skeet said with confidence. "it

wouldn‘t have been close."

This afternoon. the Danes face a

For the first time ever the Albany
varsity lacrosse team beat the
Lakers of Oswego Saturday after-
noon by the score of 9-5 to up their
season record to 4.5.

The game was played irt less than
favorable conditions with rather
overcast skies. a chilly wind and a
low temperature.

Right off the opening face-off.
Oswego‘s Mark Mancini took the
ball and scored the game's first goal
with only 14 seconds elapsed. htrt
the Danes rebounded irt firtc
fashion as Mike Slocum got a pass
from Tom Pratt at tile five
minute mark to tie the game at one.

At this point the Danes began to
dig into the Oswego squad with effi-
cient aggressive play in artd around
the Laker cage. Warren Wray
scored the first of his three goals
with just IS seconds to go itt the
first quarter as he fired an
unassisted shot irtto tltc Oswcgo
net.

On the afternoon Albrnty did not
fare to well on face—offs — taking
only one all game. To open the sc-
cortd 15 minutes quarter. Slocum
was called for delay of game and
was handed a technical violation.
The Danes began a quarter
characterized by aggressive defense
and offense-minded determination.

Ken DaRos got a pass from Wray
just 1:40 into the quarter that just
went above the net on a solid pass-
ing effort.

“1 like to shoot high bttt this time
1 shot the ball just a little too sharp-
ly." said DttRos. At this poirtt

in the attacking zone. At 7:35 and
9:15 of the second quarter Albany
scored it's fotrrth and fifth goals as
Wray took a pass from Slocum and
DaRos caught a pass front Wray.

“Titc play was an unsettled situa~
tion. We were filling the lanes artd
Warren came around and fed the
ball to me so 1 could get a shot at
the net.“ said DaRos.

“This was the best game I‘ve ever
played. 1 haven't been playing real
well lately and the team has been in-
consistent btrt today 1 was looking
and playing good team ball. 1 was
really lttrstling and in turrt I was in-
tltc right place to score goals." said
Wray.

Verticr cante on strong with fottr
minutes remaining in the half to up
the score for tltc Danes to 6-2. bttt
()swcgo’s Mark Serrott closed the
half with his unassisted trtily at
12:40 to end half witlt Albarty up by
four rrr 6-2. At this surge of the
game.’ the contest was ttrrrting
slightly in Oswcgo's favor based on
their timely stick-checking and
hard-hitting.

Again. Oswcgo won the opening
face-off 1f the third quarter. The
quarter began with an early Dane

fast break with midfielder Ltrkc
Esp'osito attacking wide on tltc
Oswcgo net witlt a firte pass to Jon
Rcilly who rttrttrncd a sharp shot at
the net that was blocked by a fine
save at the hands of Oswego goalie
Evan Sovring.

At tlte 1:36 mark Oswcgo’s Scr-
ron scored his second goal of the
game to pttt tltc Lakers witltin three
-— the closest they would ever come
the rest of the game. Early in the
quarter. the game was ttrrning into
a torrential battle witlt sloppy play
and careless mistakes by the visiting
team. There was also some nice
defensive saves by Albany net-
minder Ken Tirman on Oswcgo's
Scrrort as ltis point-blank attempt
on rtct was thwarted.

At 8:20, Esposito took a pass
from Wrag for Albany‘s seventh
goal. ' st was Wray s second
on tlte afternoon to go along witlt
his tltrcc goals.

“Today was undoubtedly Wur-
ren's finest pcrforrtttutcc.“ said
Albtuty lacrosse coach Mike Motttr.

Thirty-lite seconds later .loltrt
Nelson prrt Albany up PM as the
lJartcs ltrrtl ()swcgo irt n man-up

unassisted goal. Wrrty ended tltc
third quarter scoring at lltc 10

DaRos. "We are capable of playing
good lacrosse. it’s just a matter of
prrttirtg it all together." said
DaRos.

The College Entrance Ii\arninn~
