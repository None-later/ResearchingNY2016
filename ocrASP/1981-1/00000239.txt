Anti-Draft Speaker Featured at “Peace Week ”

by Site Hemingway .

“The future is pretty scary in the
US. at this point because there
doesn‘t seem to be any real outrage
in the country." voiced anti-war ac-
tivist Bruce Bayer Wednesday even-
ing in Lecture Center 23 during a
panel discussion on non-
registraiion for the draft. Bayer,

who has served time for draft eva-t

sion. said he believes registration
for the draft may again become
mandatory this fall.

Also speaking at the peticu Week‘s
patiel was Dennis Schlcnker. a
lawyer active in the peace move-
ment. He said he graduated from
law school in 1960, “iii the time

people who were not all aimed in
the convenient directions of work-
ing for banks. businesses. and
such."

During eight years of draft work
for clients. Sclilcitker represented
more than 1.000 people in different
cases as well as participating in
draft counseling.

Schlenker observed that when he
was in school. students "were far
more actively involved in issues."
He said that perhaps today‘s apathy
seen on campuses is because there is
no Vietnam. “I think people do get
together in adversity." he added.

Schlenkct spoke at lettgtli about
the history of the draft in America.
a field he knows well from his iii—

volvement with draft cases from
1968 through I976. “The draft is
really an extension of imperialism,"
he said. “And the first Selective
Service Act in 1917 turned out to
have some interesting features. A
person. for example, could pay to
get out of the draft. You could get
another body to fill your shoes."

After l9l7. Sclilenker said. the
government seriously studied the
draft system for 20 years. Then they
come up with the model for the
Selective Service Act in I940.

This draft act was needed, he
said. because the draft system was
being attacked on the streets and in
the courts.

“One theory against the draft

 

 

 

 

 

was that it was unconstitutional."
he noted. “Slavery had been pro-
hibited by the l9th Amendment but
drafting men to serve on the battle
lines was another type of involun-
tary servitude. The draft violated a
citizen's first amendment rights. It
removed the basic right to control
one's own destiny."

Sclilenker further noted. the
draft was unconstitutional by the
very fact that women were not be-
ing drafted. Perhaps even less ob-
vious to many people. Sclilcnker
said. the draft was in effect “class
discrimination because the rich
could buy someone to take their
places.”

Draft dcl‘erincnts were allowed
for engineers. priests. and for
medical reasons. he said.There were
student cxcmpiio‘ns.

And if you were gay. no one
wanted you. including the draft
system." Schleiiker noted. “if you
wanted to get out there was always
a way." he said, pointing out that
more than a few atheists actually
went to divinity school to be enroll-
ed iii religious study when their
numbers for draft enlistment came
up.

In effect what happened,
Schlenker said, is that “the poor
people have always fought our wars
for us." Many of his anti-draft legal
clients were essentially middle ealss
and able to afford his legal help as
their middle-class parents afforded
tax lawyers. “The whole Selective
Service was class-oriented. The
white middle-class could get out
basically...lt was tragic that Blacks.
Hispanics. Chicanos were getting
killed in ‘Nam." the lawyer said.

People begun to see the draft as
an act of personal invasion. Then
Sehlcnkcr said “along came the
marriage exemption. Everybody
who was married by a certain date
would riot have to enlist."

So I4 years ago [layer turned in
his draft card and became an anti-
war activist. He refused induction
twice and nothing happened. “i
was playing a cat-and-mouse game
with the government...but one day I
got caught, was arrested and sent to
prison. The F.B.l. harassed my
parents back in Buffalo..." he ex-
plaiiied.

Bayer later noted that “jail is the
most godawt‘ul place you can im-
agine. I had seen draft resistance
and going to jail was a kind of
dead-end street. You had no one to
listen to your case against the war
once they had you behind bars."

in relaying his years as an anti-
war aclivist. Buyer said at one time
he emigrated to Canada and from
there flew to Sweden. “1 left North
American as a fugitive. And I arriv-
ed in Sweden as a hero."

Bayer laicr won his case with the
Supreme Court "on a technicality. \

new more about the dullniylhm
than they did." he said.

Bayer was a draft resistor at age
20. He came back to the US. in two
years and had the distinction of be-
ing the first draft resistor to return
home. He explained his philosophy
and _anti—war emotions.
"Alienation is when you‘re against
Ihc war. llut it's also in the case of
resisting the draft that you are so
against the war that you want the
other side to win."

llayer said llicrc has never been a
draft iii our nation unless a war was
going on. The LLS. Draft ended of-
ficially in l‘)74-75 “because only
one out of sewn or eight people
wcic even going in," liiiyer said,
“It was it farce.

Forty-nine thousand Americans
died in Vici Nam." Bayer noted.
“And the suicides committed
because of ‘Nam are mind-boggling
as are ilic after-effects of neuroses.
alcoholism. drug abiises...serious
problems among our cx-GJs."

Women
continued from fI‘UIN PM!"

“There are a small number of
women applying to teach the
sciences. said Webb. “it is not that
they have less aptitude. it’s just
historicaiy women have not been
encouraged to teach the sciences.

"We were looking for an assis-
tant biology professor and only 15
percent women applied. The chair
decided it was not fair. and decided
not to fill the position this
semester." he noted.

Sylvia Barnard, the only female
professor currently teaching in the
Classics Department. pointed out
that sortie women who were
preciously employed in academic
life give up their jobs to accompany
their husbands to another area. and
may he forced to work in industry
as it may have the only job oppor-

tunities available. I
