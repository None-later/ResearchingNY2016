crazy driver

George Bellou of South Shirley,
New York. bought a I976 used
Dodge Dert lust month; and after
driving it for a few days. Ballou
began to suspect that something
was fishy.

 

That’s because the odometer in
his car was running backwards.
When Ballou bought the car a few
weeks back. the odometer showed
the car had traveled 33.535 miles; -
this week, after nearly a month of
driving. the odometer read only
32.923 miles.

Ballou suspects that it‘s not just
an accident that his odometer is ac-
ting up; he believes that someone
may have been moukcying with the
device before he bought the car.
Says Bttllou, who has complained to
the Local Consumer Affairs Com-
mission, "I fch l'vc been ripped
off. God knows how many miles it
has on it."

Weber. writing in the science
news magazine Discover. says that
because girls reach puberty carlcr
than boys do, their brain
hemispheres remain closer together.
She suggests this closeness allows
the female hemispheres to work
more closely together. resulting in
intuitch thinking.

Men. on the other hand. are said
to be better at math than women.
chcr suggests this may happen
because the right hcmisphcrc is not
being distracted by the left and
therefore can be more precise.

Are you a frustrated writer who's
looking for a way to get your
materiel published? Well. this may ‘
bc your big chance.

A Chinese Fortune Cookie Fac-
tory in Toronto reports it is looking
for all kinds .of short slogans —-
from funny to scrlous — that can be
locked inside its cookies.

Sunny Lee, the owner of Far East

.Food Products, says the material

must be short. original and mean-
ingful. And it can be about
anything — including politics, sex,
and religion.

Women

"Professors were expected to go
around the country for advance-
ment. This put a lot of women out
ofjobs. I feel that we‘re all going to
stop travelingso much.“ she added.

Bosc said that a women‘s family
life should not be considered when
she applies for a job.

“They have no right to worry
about a woman‘s family when
opening a university position. A
woman with a family can publish
just as much its ri mule. They don‘t
helicvc it woman is good enough
hecitusc we're not likc them,“ said
hilltl.

Burnaid never took time off to
lunc lici child. “I Iiitiglit my
grmluiitc (ircck course when
my baby was five days old. If men
iciilly want us to hc homc witlt a
baby. they shouldn‘t any flIill'\ why
we're tint cmploycd." islll.‘ said.

Barnard added that when II
wumun docs take time out to have a
baby it inukcs it harder for her to
gel back into teaching.

DcSoIc confirmed IIInt women

with P\\.D'u who have fomllys,
rcnpannlbllluen would be more -\-

traded in academia because the
hours are more ﬂexible. “Thch are
lots of ways to do it. The old ways
of her staying home are not
economically and socially possible
these days." slit: snid.

l)cSo|c feels the fiiiurc outlook
for increasing the number of
women on campus is hopeful. "We
have placed a your goitl's time table
to hiic more minorities and
women." slic said.

Kol‘i‘ also sees bcttcr oppor-
tunities for women. “Affirmative
Action is moving women into
supcrintcndcnt positions." he said.

As of January I. Affirmative Ac-
tion begun to report directly to
SUNYA l’rcsidcnl Vincent
O‘lcary " He's very serious about
the opportunities of the Affirmative
Action Office." DcSolc said.
