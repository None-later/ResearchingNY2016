Lesser or Two Evils

_______’_————
Jlll Marsh and Paul Sawyer

Hugh Carey. After we pull the SASU
voodoo pins out of his hide. what do we
have? Sadly, we probably have the most
reasonable choice for governor next year.
Two relatively unrelated items have more or
less convinced me of this.

The ﬁrst is what can be considered a ma-
jor error by many progressives. including
myself. That error was not supporting ex-
President James Earl Carter in the general
election. Clearly. the old pro-nuke and pro
draft Carter was bad on a lot of issues. not
to mention mean-spirited. as he attacked
Senator Kennedy. But as all progressive-
minded persons should have learned after
only three months of his four year term.
Reagan is opposed to his selections of Watt.

* Edwards. Weirrburger. and Stockman. to
name just a few. is: one man does not an
administration make.

Consider how Cecil Andrus as interior
Secretary under Carter allowed en-
vironmentalists to fight over the Alaska
Land Preservation bill: “it should be 98
million acres." “No. i say l02 million
acres."

His successor. James Watt. would laugh
at the above errcotrnter sadistically as he
drove an iii-wheeler over some endangered
vegetation in a federal wilderness area.

The second event was more subdued. yct
sparked this column. It was the front page
article in last month‘s Village Voice on the
right-to-choosc issue (or abortion rights).
This incredibly concise and emotional piece
congealed a lot of free ﬂoating thoughts
that l have gathered recently. The article

“and n“ of the oleﬁn bnckwnrd that have
taken p‘ue \n the past few ycnrs eroding

women's reproductive freedom. This fun-
damental rigltt of all women is relatively
new, many scent to forget.
Since the l973 Supreme Court decision.
the rigltt wing ltas successfully cltippcd
away at a woman's control over her body.

 

Let Down

To the Editor:

They call it Celebration '8]. i call it
“let-down '8ll" And once again this
university falls into the folds of mediocrity.
i am strongly opposed to sotrrc of the
changes that have been made itr regards to
SUNYA'S annual outdoor spring concert

This year or next. The Voice article fears. a
total repeal by constitutional amendment is
a potential reality. it would seem that the
time to respond has come. and many
organized grOups such as those present on
the SUNYA campus have become active.

~ Hugh Carey fits into this situation
because he represents another flawed can-
didate like Carter. He deserves support.
however. in spite of his cruel and uncalled
for attacks on the SUNY system. What do
we have if Carey or another similar can-
didatc loses to the standard conservative
Republican?

Statewide. we lose Medicaid funding for
abortion. almost immediately. Also. it is
only because of Hugh Carcy that we do not
ltavc the death penalty. Think about that.
No other issue can be rrrorc clearly shown to
have the imprint ofonc person. His bravery
in standing up to those who would use this
cheap political trick to lower a society for
some votes is without equal.

There are other issues that are as impor-
tant as those above. Witlrottt any wavering.
it cart be admitted that Carey's SUNY
policy is not the only issue he has corrte
down on the wrong side of. But don‘t com-
pare Carey to an ideal. Compare him to
Perry Durca or Warren Anderson. typical
republican candidates who support less

control over bandit corporations. less
governmetrt services for the needy. and
other anti-people positions.

Do we blindly follow politicos like
Carey? No. we find realistic alternatives. if

Campus Center from turning into a clut-
tered mess. and that event was held inside.

i do agree with some of the changes made
for this year's celebration. though. Chang-
ing the date will surely deter some of the
“townies” from crashing the concert. [I
will mean that the weather may not be the
best. but it will. as it set out to do, lessen the
number of people in attendanCe overall.
Moving the food and beer facilities away
from the Campus Center was also a well
thought-out decision. This should surely
lessen the damage done in and around the
Campus Center a great deal. Let us hope
that the Dutch Quad Cafeteria remains tn
tact. since the food and beer facilities will
be lOcatcd just outside this area.

So what am I supposed to do? There are
two basic aspects regarding Celebration '8]
that trotrblc the greatly. First, fencing in
students while they are supposed to be
celebrating is ludicrous! Furthermore. if so—
nrconc ically wants to get itr or to bring in
food or dritrk. those tlimsy fences will not
make it too difficult at all. Secondly. and
most importantly, it is highly unfair to
charge every sttrdanfor admission to a
concert where: (1) they are not allowed to
bring in food or drink of their own on to
the premises; (2) cvetr though they may not
eat or drink any of the food or drink pro-
vided. they are being charged art equal price
as those who do; and (3) students who do
not pay will still be able to attend the con-
cert either by remaining just outside the
fence or by even streaking itrto the actual
concert area. There is no way this can be
avoided at an event of this magnitude.

My suggestions are to take dowrt tltosc
fences. They merely hint at a solution. but
are more detracting and degrading to the
spirit of Celebration 'Bl titan they are
worth. Without a massive security system to

 

available. for a primary light. But unless we
are willing to risk division and allow
heartless old men like Reagan or Alphonse
D‘Amato itrto office. we ntrtst consider
artothcr older moral: the lesser of two evils
is better. This is particularly trttc if the
lesser evil is tolerable. such as Carter or
Carey, arid the other choice is really not a
legitimate choice. the typical republican .

event that we once knew fondly as Mayfest.
And i am even more deeply distressed at the
lack of student voices protesting these
outrageous changes.

Yes. Mayfest was a huge and messy
event. Those are two major difficulties in-
herent in any large annual event. Did you
see what the Campus Center looked like
after Telethon this year? Even a 24-hour
crew of cleaners couldn't even keep the

patrol those fences (which cover an are“
larger than two football fields). gate
erushers cannot be deterred. Wouldn‘t it be
more logical to rise a more limited security
force to check that all concert attendees ac-
tually possess tickets and tax cards and to
make sure no altercations begin in the first
place?

instead of charging one price for all who
attend Celebration '8]. it would be far
more equitable to charge alt admission fee
for tickets ol' say one or two dollars which
only students with tax cards may purchase.
Then an additional fee could be charged for
those partaking in the food and drink pro-
vided at the event. These combined fees
would certainly cover a great deal of the ex-
penses of CelebratiOn ‘8l. including a larger
student-organilcd clean-up crew to
straighten the fields up during arid follow-

ing the concert.
in other words. i agree that changes were
needed to keep the annual Mayfest a
manageable and successful event. But it is
my opinion that in the planning of Celebra-
tion '81 those concerned have made too
many drastic and unnecessary changes
without considering other more desirable
solutions. in addition. 1 am dismayed that
so few of the grumbling students roaming
this Campus Center have actually Spoken
up to protest this “let-down" they call

Celebration ’Bl.

Fenced Out

To the Editor:

University Concert lloard (UCB) has
done it again. Togetlter with UAS they have
finally ruitrcd what was once a great cvent. i
am referring to this year's Celebration ‘81,
something we alumni remember as Mayfest
(funny how there used to be a Falli‘csr, loo).

Fencing iii the event to keep people out
does it disservice to the community ill lrir ge.
Why can't the people who helped build
SUNY/t. tltc residents of the State of NC“
York. attend this festival too? We don't
have tax cards. but we'd like to see tin-
show.

l don't remember any problems last year
that weren't title to lack of planning Ir)
UAS and UCB. 'l‘lrcrc haven‘t been any
riots or brawls at these partying events. It'
the people running the show put more
thought ittto details: make it easier to use a
toilet. or get a beer nrore rapidly and put
out more trash t‘cccptublcs: they wouldn‘t
have to rttitr what was once the best public
rclations-comnrunity event SUNYA held
each year.

Don't virtually limit admission to certain
"students" with special cards. (let it
together and have a real good. controlled
party. but don't fence me out.

chp the and my cooler out. btrt don‘t
look for smiles when you step off the bus
rn my city.

Frattinq It

To the Editor:

We. tltc 38th pledge class of Theta Xi
Omega, wish to make our views known to
the entire student body. both
undergradtratc and graduate. about the
state of affairs at SUNY at Albany.

We believe that belonging to a fraternity
or sorority is an integral part of the school's
educational processes. it is sad for us to see
how many other fraternities and sororities
that have had to fold because of luck ol’
membership.

iii no other fashion can you learn so
much about your fellow students. The
academic. social and athletic virtues of llic
educational system are stressed.

We are saddctrcd to see how few people
have ‘(iL‘L‘itiL‘ti to pledge fraternities and
sororities this year. This is sad because not
cvcy I‘I'nt is like the one portrayed in Animal
Home. On the other hand. most fraternities
are places where one learns to respect his
fellow human beings.

.Tllrll-Olll at all events on this campus.
With the exception of the outdoor spring
concert. is frighteningly low. We feel that
everyone is ottt for themselves and that
there is no longer the school spirit that was
evrdcnt on this campus just four years ago.
There is no longer a shared school spirit ill
this school. indeed. could SUNYA stand
lor the State University of New York

 

wading in Apathy? We think so.

The only way to corrch this is to join any

trntcrnrty/sorority tltltl learn what trm‘
scltool spirit is about.

Tonight. May 1. is hell night. We will

become brothers of TXO and we are proud
of ourselves. our brothers. and of lht’
lratcrtuty that we are joining.
