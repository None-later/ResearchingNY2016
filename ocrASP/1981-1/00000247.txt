ATTEND—
ANT

. . . but these lie in wait for.
their own blood; they ambush
their own lives.

-— Proverbs 1:18

full moon hung In the night sky

and its grey rays of light flood-

ed Ed's bedroom. while he

snared. having succumbed to a deep
sleep. The only other sign of life In the
room came from the red display on the
clock—radio. It sat. along with a pair of
glasses and a yellow telephone. on a
small ni ht table. The floor was clut-

Vincent Aiello
tered with thrown clothing, In disarray

like a pastel pattern. The walls. even In
the poor lighting. showed their age. The
ring of the telephOne sounded to scar
the evening's normality.

Ed threw his arm over to the stand as
if It was the only part of his body that
contained life. After finding the

 

 

  

telephone. he brought the receiver over
to the side of his head.

"Hello." automatically came out.
ne'edless of thought.

“Ed.” said the voice. panting to gain
Its breath. “This is Jim. at the gas sta-
tion." Again a pause for breath. "I . . .
need the combination to the safe."

Ed wiped one of his eyes and reached
over for his glasses.

“What?” he asked and glanced to the
clock-radio. It was twelve thirty-seven.

"I need the'comblnatlon to the safe."
Jim spoke through gasps for air.

“What do you need the combination
for. Jim?"

"I just need it, that's all. Just tell me
what it is.” » .

"I can’t. You know It's_ against com-
pany policy. And what are ya still doing
there? You shoulda closed at mid-
night."

Ed could hear Jim talking away from
their conversation. '

“I told ya he couldn't give It to me."
he heard Jim say. a

Then a voice he could not recognize
said, “Gimme that goddam phonel” Ed
heard a thump sound like a sack being
dropped to the floor. ‘

“Is this the station manager?"
demanded the voice.

“Who's this?" Ed asked.

"Never mind who this Is. My buddy
and I want the combination to the safe.
Your attendant's lying on the floor tied
-up and my friend has a twelve gauge'
pump shotgun pointed at his face. Now
you either tell us the combination. or
your attendant's gonna get his fucking
head blown off!"

“Hold on a second." He threw his
legs over the side of the bed and sat up.
“Let me talk to Jim again."

“Get him up." Ed heard the voice call
away from the phone. “He wants to talk
to ya. You better get that goddam com-
blnation out of him or you're dead‘:"

“Ed?” he heard Jim's tired voice ask.

“What happened. Jim?"

"I had put away all the money and l
was outside sticking the tanks for the gas
levels. when these guys came up. I
thought they wanted information. but

 

- . E". "m. .
they grabbed me. and they thought i
knew the combination to the safe."
“Are you all right?" Ed asked.
“I — " He was abruptly cut off and
the other voice came back on the line.

“Kill'hImJ'Ed could hear the voice
say away from the phone.

“Hold Itl" Ed yelled.

“l'm listehtng. My buddy is over by
the sale. You relay It to me and I'll relay
It to him. Start talking."

“Oka’y. First you gotta — "

PLEASE DEPOSIT FIVE CENTS
FOR THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES OR
YOUR CALL WILL BE INTER—
RUPTED. THIS IS A RECORDING.

“Goddam pay phones. You got a
nickel?” Ed could him say away from
the phone. “How about him?"

“Look. we don't have a goddam
nickel to put In the pay phone. You're
gonna have to call us back. You got five
seconds to call us. Don‘t- get any cute
ideas. cause after live seconds. my part-
ner pulls the trigger. And if that hap-
pens. all you're gonna be able to find of
your attendant’s head will be an eyeball
and a coupla teeth. You're making the
decision if he‘ lives or dies. Unders-
tand?" he said. abruptly hanging up the
phone.

Ed quickly cleared the line. and
started dialing. The rotary phone could
not dial as fast as he could and with the
last number. his finger slipped. He
cleared the line and started dialing
again. After all seven numbers. he
heard the ring.

"Just in time. Mr. Station Manager.
Now let's get going here. cause we don't
have all night."

"Once you get the combination. what
happens to Jim?"

“He's gonna have to come with us.
just until we make sure there’s no trou-
ble. Then we'll let him go. I‘m not a
murderer. all I want is the money. What
I am is a common thief. just like Husoco
Oil. They charge close to a dollar and a
half a gallon for gas that costs them
about eight cents a gallon. Now you tell
me. who's the bigger thief?" He paused
for slight contemplation, “Now. what's
the combination? And no bullshit or
your attendant's dead."

“First. you go clockwise past zero
three times to . . ." Ed spoke on and on
with all the feeling of a lamb asking
directions to a slaughterhouse.

-.-.-

The small office in front of the gas sta-
tion poured light out onto the dark yard.
where the six. self-serve pumps sat
silently. shut off for the night. The only
life to be found was in the small cubicle

“He's not doing so good. You see I   

thought he was lying about not knowing
the combination. so I hit him in the face
with the butt of the shotgun. Hts nose is
bleeding and so is the corner of his
mouth. Now I want that combination or
he dies. You understand?"

“Look. the company has this policy."

"Fuck the company! I bet this station
grosses more in an hour than you take
home all week. Husoco Oil is a big shot.
multi-natlonal corporation that's worth
billions. And they pay you just enough
to keep you poor. They'll never miss
whatever‘s in that sale."

“It‘s gonna cost me my job."

“It's gonna cost your attendant his
life‘. I can't believe you‘re gonna let this
guy die for a lifeless corporation like
Husoco Oil. A dollar bill is worth‘ more
to them than a human life. Do you think
that way. too?" After a brief pause. “l'm
warning you —— you either give me that
combination or you're gonna be scrap-
Ing his brains off the floor In the morn-

 

 

where. locked inside. the attendant and
the cans of oil where kept and where
money passed in and out through a
stainless steel. sliding drawer.

Inside. two of the walls were mostly
glass. while the back wall was painted
bright yellow to match the attendant's
shirt. The fourth wall was simple
pegboard. covered with company an-
nouncements and notices from the
labor board. In the corner. on the
yellow wall by the pegboard. was the

 

timeclock. It hung there clicking off the
minutes in a mindless mechanical cycle.

The oil rack, filled with different
weights of oil and transmission fluid.
was on wheels leaning back against the

yellow wall. Its height was a little less -'

than half that of the wall.

The two men stood on each side of
the yellow counter. On the wall was the ‘
pay phone and on the counter sat a 7 "
small gym bag.

"Adios." he said and his glovedlhand
hung up the phone. He looked over at
Jim. who stood on the other side of the
counter. He was wearing his yellow shirt

with a ‘HUSOCO' patch over the left -

pocket. A triumphant smile lit up his

ace.

“You should get an Academy Award
for that performance." Jim said. holding
out his hand In anticipation of a hand-
shake.

"Let’s get outta here before the cops
come ‘

proudly proclaimed.
“Almost perfect."
“What do ya mean Ialmost"? See how

easy It was? I told ya. We didn't even 53

need a gun.”

“I brought one anyway." he said.
pulling a nickel~plated. forty-four caliber
revolver out from under the money In
the gym back. He showed it to Jim.

"Jesus. why'd you bring that cannon?
What were you planning on. killing an
elephant?" Jim asked. stuffing the
money back Into the bag.

Again In his precise. cold tone. he
said. “No. Killing you."

Jim glanced to the pistol in shock and
disbelief. Within a second. It fired two
shots Into him. The last thing he saw
wasthe kickback of the powerful gun
with each shot.

The first bullet hlt Jim squarely in the
chest. His yellow Husoco shirt ripped
from his back as the first shot sprayed
out blood and flesh. The second bullet
him on the left side of his chest. causing
his body to fall Into the oil rack. and
both slammed to the floor. Jim's leg
made one vain attempt to rise. but
quickly went back down. The timeclock
corner of the yellow and pegboard walls
was now splattered with blood. It look-
ed as If two water balloons of blood had
been thrown into that corner.

Jim's friend walked around the
counter and saw the two large holes in
Jim's chest and the torn. yellow shirt
mixing with the blood beneath him.

"Now. It's a perfect crime. Thanks.

attendant." he said. replacing the gun in
the bag and walking over to the door.
He unlocked it and left.

The wind could be heard cutting
through the nighttime air and inside.
nothing was alive but the bloodsoaked
timeclock. On the handle that was
pressed to punch in and punch out. a
drop of blood had formed. and hung
from It. It dropped off. and before It hit
the ground. another minute clicked off
on the clock. 0
