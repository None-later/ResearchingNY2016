St. Loo Will Get
Most Out Of
NFL Draft Picks

NI‘ZW YORK (AP) —— It is. of
course. far too early to determine
just who “won” and who "lost" in
the National Football League’s
IORI college draft. Rut the St. Louis
Cardinals appear a likely bet to get
the most ottl of their top picks.

round before selecting. li..l. .Itrttior.

shooting down reports that the Los
Angeles Rants. trying to improve on
their Not 0 position iii the first
rotrnd. were burning up the phone
lines to St. Louis.

"the Cards also had to be thinking
about replacing veteran quarter-

artd trrost ADO—yard games 12. He
has been called by sortie the best
small-college quarterback since
Terry Bradshaw.

The only quarterback rated
ahead of Lornax — and not by
everybody —- is California's Rich
Campbell. The Green Bay Packers.
looking for a return to the glory
years whcrt llart Starr was their
quarterback and not their embattl-
ed coach, picked Campbell in the
first round.

That first round Tuesday was the
“celebrity round" when Heisman
Trophy winner George Rogers, the
South Carolina running back, was
selected No. l by New Orleans.
North Carolina linebacker
Lawrence Taylor was taken No. 2
by the New York Giants and the
rest of the lit teams pttt their futures
— not to ruention some small for-
tunes —- on the line with their picks.

On Wednesday. the ciretts at-
mosphere at the draft was gone,
replaced by the routine btrsiness of
cutting off one little-know name
after the otlter.
