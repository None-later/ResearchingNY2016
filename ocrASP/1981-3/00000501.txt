- * " 'SUNYAC Champs
Face Inexperience

by Larry Kahn

The 1980-81 SUNYAC trophy belongs
to the Albany State basketball team.
Nobody can take it away from them, but
neither can anybody bring back the tour
seniors who were so instrumental in winn-
ing that championship and leading Albany
to a 23-5 finish —— their greatest season
ever.

No. the 1981-82 version of the Great
Danes will be without the services of
‘ guards Rob Clune and Ray Cesare. for~
ward Pete Stanish and supersub Steve
Low who ended their careers after the
Danes‘ overtime loss to Potsdam in the
NCAA East regional last year. Together
the quartet averaged 40 points per game
last year.

“We just lost a tremendous amount of
experience. Those four seniors started the
last five games of the year —— that's a lot of

Chairperson. As Bob Cohen's campaign
manager in Ward It. i had particularly ask-
ed Mark to obtain the list so that we could
see how many students had registerd in
Bob's ward besides the more than 400 we
had registered.

Everyone from Student Association
Lawyer Lou Oliver to NYPlRG Director
Donald Ross agreed that these lists were
public information that could be given to
the Citizens Party. Either way. the voter
registration form of every person who
registers is compiled by election district in
the voter registration books at the board of
elections which are readily available to the
public.

Therefore. Mark Dunlea's request for the
list. both as OCA Director and Citizens
Party Chairperson. did not constitute a
conﬂict of interest. He had a right to those
lists in either positon. When NYPlRC: gave
the list to Mark. boili knew that the list was
to be given to me. David Pologe gave the
list to Mark in botli his capacities.

As an additional note: when registering
students to vote in Albany. the most fre-
quent objection to registering locally that
was given to me was that they (students) did
not know any of the candidates or their
positions on issues.

A conﬂict of interest eitists when a per-
son's role in one organization by nature af-
fects his/her role in his/her job. This is not
the case here. anymore than a person who is
active in the Democratic party is engaged in
a conﬂict of interest with his/her job. One's
political afﬁliation is not a factor in one's
performance as a director of OCA.

if the ASP's recommendation that Mr.
Dunlea be asked to resign as Citizens Party
co-chair is accepted. then a precedent
would be set to make one's political beliefs
and affiliation a factor in selecting staff
people for the Student Association. Such an
action is not only unreasonable. but it is
also unconstitutional.

Film Group Answers A Critic

 

To the Editor:

Last Friday's ASP printed a letter written
by Brian Hoffman regarding a situation he
encountered the previous weekend at an on-
campus showing of a film. llrian brought
out two points that he tliotiglit were the
cause of an unpleasant cxpciiencc.

He cites the disrespect of his fellow
students for each other. and the itl~
competence of Albany State (.‘irierria
(ASC). the group in charge of the opera-
tion. as the root of the problems. I should
like to make a few clarifications concerning
the incident. and organi/tilion in general.

l have been involved in tile orgatii/tition '

of tin-campus movies for the past three
years. and i must admit that Brian brings
oirt some very cvidctit problems that occur
at the lecture centers. As one of three major
film groups on campus. it is the objective of
ASC to show a variety of films for the
entertainment of the students. Willi a varic-
Iy of films. we get a variety of students at-
tending.

This past weekend. to use ti prime exam-
plc. we featured two foreign films. Lu (‘rmt'
/lll Fol/es II and It’ugeniui/iu. as well as a
midnight showing of Cream '.\' l'tlrt‘lt‘t’li
Concert. The audiciiccs viewing Lu Cage
and Kagelitiis/iu proved to be very orderly
and respectable. While during (‘rcu/ii't
Farewell. at least three cliariis were torn out
of their supports. and broken borilcs \tctc
strcwri about. Similarly, those who went to
see Kentucky Fried Muvr’c last weekend
turned out to be \ct_\' unruly.

lit tltc past we‘re bird little trouble in
dealing with large crowds for films. it
necessary. we cart usually follow witli an ex-

 

tra showing but in the case of Kentucky
Fried Movie. the starting tiriic of riiidniglit
did not allow for this. Those iii the crowd.
sensing the possibilty of not being admit-
lcd. destroyed any semblance of a line and
moved towards those selling tickets err
rtirtssc. I must agree with Brian iii saying
that some form of control over a litre
should be established (roping off areas
perhaps?) for when situations like iliis arise
in the ftittirc.

As to the points in his letter:

.Albany State Cinema always starts sell-
ing tickcts 15 minutes before a show. as was
doric the night of Kentucky Fried Movie.

OASC nearly always has six to eight peo-
ple working per show.

'ASC’s sound system consists of a 400
watts pcr channel amplifier. a 32 haiid
cqiiali/ci. and a new set of Cerwiii Vega
spcakcrs. Sound quality in a lecture cerith
is liriiilcd due to the acoustic setup of the
room. regardless of the system erriploycd.

'About a starting time —— we're here to
provide critci Iaiiiniciit for as many students
as possiblc. in such it situation. it doesn't
lltlll lit with tin extra 20 minutes so that as
many pctrplc as possible are able to see the
iriotlc.

llritiii. your comments about the
orgaiii/titiotr scctii to bc iiicrtrit well.
although at times soriicwlitit harsh. And by
the Wit). ll you know \onictliiitg about tlic
\llltlEIll apathy on ctrtiipus lllitl we don't.
tlllt personnel pcoplc would lmc your help.
We're always open to suggestions
(457—8520).

Editorial Reply

What's your opinion? We’d like to know. ‘

So we asked a question: What do you feel is the most important issue that should be ad-
dressed today? We asked 84 people (43 in the Rat and 4t in the Library). 70 of whom came
up with 40 speciﬁc issues. ~ -

Why did we do this? The answers match what we feel are some of the .more general
responsibilities of this newspaper. Broadening the lines of communication with our fellow
students is always important. With this survey we were able to express our concern with
students as well as getting a very broad idea of some of the topics you'd like to see covered
in these pages.

Now to the method. 84 students asked pcrsoti-to-pcrson. We hit people at the poles of
the SUNYA spectrum: those engaged in festivities (hie) and those immersed in study. This
afforded us the chance to cover most of the in-betwccns as well.

The moment you've all been waiting for has now arrived: the tally. Out of 70 people who
answered. nine cited tilt economy as the issue they fell deserved the most attention. After
this. five said pre-regist ation was tops. four said they cared most about apathy and linen
cial aid; pre-auditing. inﬂation. rind war each received three votes. Seven issues received
two nods each: unemployment. SUNYA vandalism. the Mideast crisis. the federal budget.
the inefficiencies of our campus administration. the selling of AWACS. and nuclear
weapons. The lack of political knowledge on the world level received one-and-a-half votes
(don’t ask how). and 25 other issues. ranging from campus safety to the poprrlation explo-
sion, rounded out the Field.

Front these ﬁgures. certain interpretations (or rather. observations) present themselves,
although we are the first to declare that these arc. by no means. solid interpretations. One
cannot get a clear picture ofall the important thoughts going on in the mind of Students by
asking less than one percent of the population one question. However. certain general in-
fcrcticcs about strident attitudes and habits can he made.

For one tliitig. we must examine the different priorities found in the responses coming
from each of the two survey areas. The Rat is a place where tnariy people voice their pet-
sotial gt‘ipcs that relate to student affairs. The library is a place of study and as the mind
concentrates other thoughts are likely to surface. Of the nine people who cited the
economy as their major issue. eight were questioned in the library. On the other hand. all
five people who chose prc-rcgistration were Rat-dwellers. We believe this is a statement on
the students who frequent these campus areas. The fact that people like to either get happy
or prepare for today‘s trianagcrnent test oti a Monday night are important. but only play a
small part iii the broad overview.

The varying responses of students to this question present an interesting sketch of how
students think licte. Certain local issues included were campus safety. the problems that at
fch the student financial situation and distribution requirements. National. world and
thought issues mentioned. among others, were the Soviet threat. arms limitation. social
security. drugs war and peace. But an interesting fact arose when we noted that four
students complained speciﬁcally about issues that were personally on their minds at the
time. such as cheating on tests. unfair professors. the inadequacy of library facilitiesand
poor allocation of time afforded for use in the gym. And one student asked. simply. “Why
do born-again Christians keep telling me that the end of the world is coming?"

A final issue that deserves comment is isolation. While only one student put this at the
top of the list. the fact that id students failed to come up with an answer supports the no-
tioii that many students feel cut off from the international. national and evcti local world
which surrounds them.

No. this doesn‘t cover everything that is on your rtiiiid — but it is a start. chp coni-
nrirriicatiiig with us and inform us if we've left out your fatoritc pct pccvc. We. in the
itictuttinrc. will try to keep covcring as many of these subjects as possible. We'll call it a
trtidc. You (In your part and we'll do ours.
