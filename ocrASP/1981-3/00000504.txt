The Albany State men's varsity
swimming team opened its 1981-82
season Saturday with a fourth place
ﬁnish in the annual Great Dane
Relays held at the University Pool.
According to the men's swimming
and diving team head coach Dulce
Fernandez, “it was the best we've
done in a witile."

V Actually, tltc Danes came in tr
very close fourth as only a mere five
points separated Ihctrr artd tirird
place RPI. Coast Guard dominated
the tncet winning 7 of 8 merits, and
meet records that they had held.
Ncw Ptrlll, anolhct consistcrrtlj
strong team, placed second itr lhc
artrrttal cvcttt.

The difference between RH and
the Danes was so slight that her-
IIllIIdL‘I. feels that Albany corrld
overtake tltc Engineers itr I'cgultlr
dual mcct competition.

“In one-on-onc silrlztlions we'll
hc able to deal willr tlrcm (RI’I)
much better," said the Darrcs'
coach.

Throughout tltc course of the
rrrcct, Albany mainly look thirds
and fourths. But, as Fernandez
poirrlcd out, with learns tltc calibre
of Coast Guard and possibly New
i’altr. partaking in the cvcrrl, the big
competition was in tire lower places
(thirds, fourths and fifths).

For the freshmen on the squad
Saturday‘s meet was it gr‘cul oppor-
Itrnily to gain experience, according
to Fernanch While Iirc Dane
veterans have faced pressure situa-
lions before, the younger ft'cslrntctr

vere able to try to perform under
pressure for the first time at the
relay meet. With this kind of ex-
posure, the freshmen now have a
feeling on what to expect in future
me s‘.

rcl'haps the most pleasing finish
the Danes had during the entire
meet happened itr the 400 yard
medley relay. This race is one that
rrorvnx‘I: occurs irt cvcty regular
colitg. )IICL‘l. as the tradiliottai
optui --v went. For Albany, senior
co-c' ' ' n Neal Ullman swimming
the l. ‘-.s’lt'0kc, sophomore Frank
Ktiltlklt'wlcl. in the breast-stroke,
co~capurin Slcvc lionawit/ doing
llit‘ hrrltcrlly and freshman fr'cc
stylcr 'Iom Handy Icnntcd up to
corn an impressive second place.
llllman tnrd liontrwit/ along with
freshman .Icff Iiall took a second
place in the 300 yard backstroke
relay as well, with tr time of 2:571.

Albany's entry of Dave Ztrltala,
iiob Lento, Handy and John
Str’cctcr checked itt second in the
200 yard free style relay. "They all
ltad really good spills,“ praised Fer-
ntrndc/, “I tirittk our team is rtradc
up of good sprinlcrs."

That is very important because
according to the coach, in lire rncct
formal, time is a greater emphasis
on free style than anything else.

It'crrttrttdcl. noted that the curly
season times are prclty good now
and will only get better as the
season progresses. “It won‘t be

long bel‘orevthey start breaking var- '

sity pool records," she said.

One of the best individual efforts
of the day was turned in by
freshman Frank Parker, who
volunteered to accompany regular
Danc diver John Anderson in the
diving competition. According to
the swim meet regulations govern-
ing this event, each diving team
should have two participants.
Albtrny only had one diver available
to compete, and to avoid costing his
team a scratch irt the competition,
Parker stepped in to handle a few
relatively easy dives. As 11 result,
Albany rcccivcd ten points for the
cvcnl. '

Fcrnandcr is particularly proud
of the fact lltai hcr learn finished
ahead of a Division I opponent,
Urrivcrstiy of Vermont. Although
Vermont won the diving, it placed
fifth ill the meet overall. Other
schools in orch of finish were: Vcr-
rttoul in fifth McGill, I‘lallsburgh,
St. Michacls. Union and Vassar.
respectively.

The Danes now take a break
from their schedule until just after
the 'I‘Iranksgiving holiday. cht
Wednesday, Albany frosts New
l’lllll at University Pool beginning
at 7 p.m. and tire following
Wednesday, lltc Danes will venture
across the, river to RPI to swim the
Engineers itr what Fernanch ex-
pects to hc "a competitive meet and
a good rtrccl to see."

Tournament basketball Is a sport within a sport. It is anywhere from
a two to six game season, where previous sutcess or failure is mean-
ingless, and only perfection is rewarded. The only way to succeed'at

handle the unique pressurestbat come with a sudden deatbtype of for:
mat. Tournament play has to be handled with assurance and guilc.
things that come with time and practice, mainly practice.

That is wiry teams play tournaments either at the start of the season
or at Christmas time. It is invaluable experience getting in some
pressure ballgamcs before your league schedule starts. It is double im-
portant for independent teams to play in some tournaments, for they
do not have a league schedule to toughen them up, and, as a result.
these teams are sometimes left at the gate conte March. If you do not
helich, ask Nolre Dante or DePauI. 

Two of the most prominent early season tournaments are in Alaska
and Hawaii. The Great Alaskan Shootout, to be ltcld this weekend in
Anchorage, annually features sotnc of the ﬁnest clubs iii the nation.
Five of the nation‘s top 20 teams, including national runner-up North
Carolina, \vcr’c itr last year's Shoolout. Tire Rainbow Classic, hcltl bet-
ween Christmas and New Year‘s Day itr Honolulu, is another eight-
learn, three-day affair which attracts great competition. National
champion Indiana and Clcmson were antongrtltc teams itt last year's
Classic. -

An added advantage of these two tournaments is that the three
games, played outside of the continental United States, do not count
against the 26-game team lirnil that is set by the NCAA. In effect,
llrctt, what the competing teams have is three added games of ex-
perience, an edge llrat is too big to pass up.

Observing early season tournaments can be a great asset when
prcdicling time comes around irt March. For some reason, certain
learns just do not play well irt tight situations. and do not fare well in
tournaments. Georgetown was It good example of this last Season. The
Hoyas, a young team, just did not cut it in the loser goes home at-
mosphere that surrounds tr tournament. Also, momentum is a major
faclor in a post-season tournament. Teams that do well the last ten
days or two weeks of the season are much more likely to do well titan
teams that have struggled down the slrctch. It is very hard to turn ex-
ecution and intensity on and off like a faucet.

Witch lltc NCAA tournament comcs around in March, examine
these factors. Look at what learns lch‘done well in tournaments
throughout the season; search for Icarus lital ltavc been together for a
while, because they are much ntorc likely to be a team with tourna-
nrcIrI savvy. Look for a team that has won a big game or two on the
rotrtl, since very few NCAA games are played on home floor sites. The
tougher thc competition for it learn during the regular season, tltc bet-
Icr lliltl Icartr gets, and tire more likely its success in a tournament. Tire
mosl important ingredient, tirorrgh, is that tournament experience.
There is no substitute for experience, and tltcrc is no better indicator
of tire l'uturc titan the past.
