"Danes  Union. 65-49
Engineers Triumph, 45-40;

by Larry Kuhn

TROY. N.Y.-RPl proved to be a
most ungracious host this weekend
when they entertained Albany,

Union and Western Connecticut in.

the let Capital District Basketball
Tournament. The Engineers eon-
ped tire championship in the annual
event by defeating Albany in the
final, 45-40. I

it was tlte first time that RPI bad
ltosted the tournament and only the
second time they won it. Albany
had Won it Ilte last three years.

But this year the Danes were a lot
less experienced than in the past
three years and RP! was able to
capitalize on their impatient of-
fense—something that Union was
unable to do iii the ripening game.
Albany trounced them 65-49 to
make it to ttre title game.

Despite their inability to
penetrate RPl’s zone defense
Albany was always withitt a few
points. With only 2:44 left itr the
garlic frcshntan guard Dan
Croutier, who had 16 points lit the
game, satrk two free throws to knot
the gatrre at 38-38.

KPI senior Bill Kelley came right
back with a lay-up, however. arid
the Dattes were forced to rely on tile
outside shot once more to try to
ererr it rrp. Albatry ntissed three

consecutive jump shots and the
Engineers increased their lead to
42-38 with free throws from Bill
LeVine and Kelley.

With 34 seconds remaining
LeVine stepped to the foul line and
sank two free throws to ice the vic-
tory.

"They wore us down," said
Albany basketball coach Dick
Sauers. “We did a lot of lttrstling
and came up empty willt a lot of
balls."

Albany‘s ittahilily to get inside. in
sharp contrast to tile second half of
the Union game. was their
downfall. They had to rely heavily
on their otrtside shooting which was
just not on the mark. They sank ort—
ly l5 of 42 shots from the floor.

One factor irl that statistic was
that tile Danes' top outside shooter.
Mike (iatto. was hobbled witl'
aching ankles and was ineffective in
tire garlic. He scored only two
points against Rl’l after udtlirtgyl4
points irr tlte Uttiotr contest.

Against Uniott the whole learn
gelled. particularly in the second
half. Early lit the game Albany's in-
experience showed a little, btrt they
played the Dutchmen basket for
basket with neither tcartr grabbing
rttote than a two point lead. Union
led at the half 26-24 on a hll/lL‘t

side jumpcrs, but was held to only

In the second half the Danes
completely outplayed Union. They

took the lead at 29-28 and never
relinquished it as they suddenly
found the key to breaking through
l:IL‘ Dutcltmerr's defense.

“We got nothing btrt layups in
the second half. We can't lose like
that." said Gallo. “Everybody
played better itt the secottd Itall'.
Yoit just couldn't play a better
half."

with a l0 for 14 shooting perfor-
mance from the floor for 24 points.
The Urriotr defenders were helpless
as Dieckelman scored inside time
after time witlr the help of some
slrarp passing by Croutier.

Albany slowly opened tip an eight
point lead to 40-32. The two rivals
traded baskets. btrt then hit a three
rnitrttte period irt which neither team
could score. Joe .lednak ended the
drttuglrt, increasing the Dane ad-
vantage to to points with two free
throws.

“At that point they seemed to
feel that they had to go all out to try
to steal the ball." noted Satrer‘s.
"Union was forced irtto a situation
where they felt they had to gamble a
lot. They were overplaying."

The Dutchmen’s gamble did not
pay off for lltetrt as Albany lttrrtcd
the game into a blowout. At one
point the Danes reeled off to

 

he first round of the Capital District 'l'ournantent as
Albany beat the Uniott Dutchmen, 65-49. (photo: More Henseltel)

unanswered point to 62-43.

Albany cut off Union's inside
garlic, and when their outside shots
stopped dropping ilt the second
half, they were in trouble. “1 think
they did a very good job defending
us," said Uniort coach llill Sennlon.
“We weren't aggressive offensively
in tertrrs of going to the basket.

“I think it took us too long to set
rtp. it took its too long every linre to
get into it." Scarrlon cotrlintted.
“They played a really slow tempo
game, where i thought a faster tern—
po would ltave been better for us."

For the Danes Dieckelmarr and
Croutier were nantcd to the All-
Tournttrnettt team for their ex-
cellent performances. Croutier,
playing irt his first varsity games.
was constantly hustling and setting
up the big plays. Dicekeltnatt's 24
point garlic against Urriotr was a
career high.
