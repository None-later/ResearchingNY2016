This ad was rejected by SUNY
Fredonia’s paper. The Leader.

But they did print an ad for Black ' “

Horse Ale that features a Woman
dressed in a scanty bikini and a
Black Horse t—shirt. The caption
reads:

“There’s only one pleasure
better.”

Deciding which ads are too of-
fensive to print is not always
easy. At least that's not what stu-

The Albany Student Press
(ASP) recently ran into this pro-

The issue began after an ad

such advertisement. Por-
