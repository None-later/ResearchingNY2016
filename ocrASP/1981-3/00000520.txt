'  Swimmers

.by MichaelVCarmen , .,
Having talent in athletics is only
half the story. In order to succeed
the athlete must have the desire to
iexcel and be the best. According to
women's swimming and diving
'coach Dulce Fernandez, her team
has that very desire needed in at-
taining their'ultimate goal: winning.
Wednesday night was no excep-
. tioir. Although the squad did drop
their meet to Mt. Holyoke. 8060,
the swimmers and divers displayed
their talent in full force, breaking
seven Albany State records en route
to their defeat.

The ﬁrst record to fall ca‘me‘in
the 200 yard medley relay. Swim-
mers Susan Keilty, Lauriann
Baines, Carolyn Lim, and Sheila
Fitzpatrick stroked to a 2:05 time.
The result was anticlimactie, but it

\must be mentioned that they lost ,

the event.

“it was very close. The girls
swam really exceptionally, but Mt.
Holyoke swam better. if we had
won this event it would have been a
14 point swing and would have
made the meet appear even closer,"
evaluated Fernandez.

After viewing the close finish in
the 200 medley relay, Ann Hoeh
was very ready when her chance ar-
rived to swim in the 200 yard in-
dividual relay. Stroking as if she
“was out for blood" Hoch placed
ﬁrst in the event and erased another
record from the Albany books. Hcr
time, 2:33, bettcrcd the previous
mark by six seconds.

“Ann swims, very well rrnder
pressure. She is a meet swimnrer
and if she wants to blow her oppo-
nent out, she can." added Fer-
rrarrdez.

Looking for their third con-I
sccutive victory of the yotrttg
season, the Albany State jtrrrior
varsityAbasketball team was over-.
powered by Union College Wednes-
day. Tlrc Dutchmen handed the
Danes an 81-67 loss.

“They didn't execute the way
they were supposed to," said new
J.V. basketball coach Dave Pry/-
bylo. “We didn‘t play our game."

If part of that game was rcbourr.
ding, then they certainly didn't.
'Albany had their problems
underneath tltc boards. Union
simply donrinatcd both ends led by
their big man Tony Pctosa, who
scored 22 points on the night. For
Union, it was the firs't win of the
season.

“Union was getting good shots

said l’rbeylo.

The Danes trailed throughout the
cotrtest btrt dttg a deep hole for
themselves as Uttiorr was tthlc to
open up a 16 point lead midway in
the secortd half. Bttt over the cortrsc
of the next trirrc trrirttrtcs, Albatry
outscored the Dutchmen 28-14.
They brought the score to 69-67
with 3:05 left on a short jump shot
by Mike Brand.

However, a few quick Albarty
fouls helped Union increase tltcit

ing and a record in the 50 yard
event. Unfortunately for herself
arid her team she placed second.

Baincs was also the victim of
Kcilty’s fate—sire broke tlrct
previous Albany best in the 50 yard
backstroke, btrt finished in second
place.

“Lauriantt was jtrst touched out.
Sire looked really good and is a
symbol of toughness,” praised tltc
coach.

Bairrcs retaliated later in the
meet, taking, first in the 100 yard
breaststroke.

records on the cvcttitrg was schedul-
ed to participate in the 50 yard

could be called an understatement
as the Albany senior placed first
and broke yet another record. l‘iL‘l

The Main. Course-

Thc month of December is merely an appetirer for college basket-’
ball fans. The main course begins the first week in January, when the
league schedules in the various conferences begin in earnest. This is
when tlringsrget serious, when the only non-conference games are for
national TV, and the learns that excel get ittvited back for dessert in
March. Here‘s how the races shape up in some of the nation's top corr-
fercnces. t

' ACC — North Carolina is a heavy favorite, bttt Virginia ltas Ralph
Sampson. Clemson has just about everyone back, NC-State has
everyone back, and Maryland has Lefty Driescll. Don’t laugh, Lefty‘s
a good coach. Just look at his record, he wins consistently. The pick,
though, is Carolina in the regular season, and State in the post-season
tournament. .

‘ SEC — Kentucky plays like the Russians, very mechanically. LSU is
just the opposite. Alabama and Florida are very young. a year away.
Tennessee and Georgia are young veteran teams. Kentucky should
marclt through the season, but look for Tcnncsscc or Georgia to win
the tournartrcnt. The SEC is America's best conference itr 1981-82.

‘ Big l0 — These guys don’t have a post-season totrrnarnctrt, which is
why they do so well lit the NCAA’s. They don't kill caclt other off tltc
way the ACC does. Iowa ltas built a wintring sitrtatiort, bttt tltc pick
here is Minnesota, a veteran learn that reached the NIT finals two
years ago with a lot of sophomores. '

° Pac 10 —— No post-season tournament here, either, brrt they l'lop in
March, with the exception of UCLA. This is tltc nation‘s most over-
rated I'ttguc, and UCLA will win it easily, with a light challenge from
the two Oregon clubs.

° Big East ~— (icorgctowrr has l’ay Ewing, Syracuse has the Carrier
Dome, St. John's is in New York City, bttt Boston College is lltc lrcsl
rcatrr. (‘otrchctl by Tom Davis, tltc [Eagles are cottlristcnly underrated,
attd have one of the nation‘s l'incst itr guard .lolrrr Bttglcy.

° Big 8 — An influx of successful coaches into this league should lttrr»
vc to be interesting in coming y 'ttts, bill this year form will hold as
Missouri, Kansas and Kansas St. will be in the money, with Norru
Stewart's 'l igcrs r'dging ottt the Kansas clubs, and bccorrrirrr' lltc first
learn itt 47 years to win lhrcc straight Big 8 crowns. ,
' Metro —— This conference is always summed up with one word #
Louisville. ,

' SWC ~— Arkansas gets 20 wins every year, but Houston is as good as

. they are this year. Rob Willianrs' recovery from knee sutch y will be

the key for Houston. These two should be joined by Texas A&l\1, a
good lorrgsltot pick, although they are slightly below the two sclrools‘
level. Houston should win the SWC.

' MV(‘ —— Finally, this rapidly irrrprovitrg league will have a dogfight
lrcIchrr Wichita, one of the nation‘s five best teams, attd 'l'ulstr. last
y 'lll ’s NIT champs. Bradley is always great at home, poor on the road,
wltilc lllittirrs St. could be a tlrrcnt in their initial MV(‘ scasort. The
pick, though, is Wichita.
