New Changes for Crossgates

by Bruce J. Levy

Controversy continues
round the proposed Pyramid
Crossgates Mall. as two new
changes have been suggested.

First, as reported in the Schenec-
tady Gazette. Guilderland Zoning
Board of Appeals member Jack
Farnswortlt has suggested that a
ramp be built leading to a bridge
over Western Avenue. to help ease
traffic congestion that would arise
‘from the mail.

In addition, mall planners have
proposed cutting tlte size of the
shopping center front 1.1 million
square feet to 975,000 square feet.
They also propose increasing the

[0 Slll’“

parking area frotn 7,090 spaces to
7.479 spaces itt order to conform to
Guilderland zoning requirctttcttts.
Concerned Citizens Against
Crossgates President Rhon-
da Cltilds said tltc two proposed
changes “aren't goint to solve the
problems in Guilderland."

She explained that “there are still
going to be 20,000 more car trips on
Western Ave. each day and . . .ttrcy
are still going to have the four big,
anchor stores there to attract the
crowds; lhcy’Vc only scaled down
the smaller stores. . . so the traffic
will still be there."

Sexual Harassment is

by Lisa Mirabella

Mary, a graduate student at
SUNYA, was the first student here
to bring a signed complaint of sex-
ttal harassment to tire Office of Af-
firmative Action. Her case is not yet
resolved, bttt she feels that tltc pro-
fessor that allegedly harassed ltcr
may never receive punishment for
the harm done to her.

 News FEATURE

Mary (not her real name) was in a
small class, with a professor who
encouraged students to work in-
dividually attd consult him in his of-
fice for extra help. She had noticed.

and lte would occassionally pat the

be somewhat strange.

At such sessions he wottld com-
rrrettt on what Mary was wearing.
She first'questiorred herself about

questioning his behavior. She made
it through the first semester. and
although leery of the professor,
took the second part of the course
with him.

During the second semester ltc

The New York State Public Scr-
vice Commission (P80 is conduci
ting hearings to determine whether
the Niagara Mohawk Power Cor-
poration should corttirttrc construc-
tiotr on the controversial Nitte Milc
Point Two nuclear power plant
located just outside of Oswego,
New York. According to Capital
District Anti-nuclear Alliance
member Ruth Foster, the PSC hear-
itth do ttot focus on the safety or
environmental health aspects of nu-
clear power, bill are only rcvicwittg'
the rising costs of construction and
of generating electricity.
Niagara Mohawk maintains that
:Nittc Mile Poittt Two cart be corn-
pletcd by l986 for $3.7 billion, and

or two after Ilte mall is built arid
add on to it,"Cltilds said.

The proposed shopping mall ltas‘
been the subject of controversy
since the developer, Pyramid
Crossgates C0,, first sought cort-
slruction permits four years ago.

Although the project received
needed permits from the State
Department ofEItvirottntental Cort-
ser'vatiott (EnCon) last September,
permission from the Dcpartmertt of
Ttattsportation (DOT) as well as the
Guilderland Zoning Board of Ap-
peals is needed before construction
can begin. '

going for extra help and filed a
complaint.

“if i had had an understanding
of the problem of sexual harass-
merit, i would have been aware of
what was happening earlier," she
said. “(But) i was acting as a sin-
dcttt with a professional attitude
artd i expected the same profes-
sionalism from him."

She said it was difficult to come
to the realization that lie was rtot ac-
ting properly until it was too late.
“1 was confused about his
behavior, but l did not know how
to react to it," she said. “i knew he
had personal problems and it was a
mistake to continue the course, but
it was necessary for my studies."

Gloria DcSoleI SUNYA Afﬁr-
mative Action Ofﬁcer, said that
many of the complaints she receives
are from graduate students. “They
are in a limited study program, and
often have closer contact with pro-
fessors than undergraduates have."

The Office of Afﬁrmative Action
this semester published a pamphlet
that deﬁnes sexual harassment as
any repeated or unwanted verbal or
physical sexual advance, sexually
explicit derogatory statements, Or
sexually discriminatory remarks
made by someone in the classroom
or workplace, which is offensive or

that the plant's electricity. will be,
cheaper titan coal or oil.'Con-
.rastingly, the Consumer Protection
Board and various other opponents
of nuclear power argue that the
plant will cost $5.7 billiort and
won't be finished until l987 at the.
earliest. '
ltt addition, a study made by
Komanol'f Associates of New York
shows that replacing tltc nuclear
plant with three coal plants will
rcduct‘ operating costs, ltclp the
utility maintain at cash flow, and
. keep dowrt the utility's rising bor-
rowing costs, according to the
Times Union.
Anti-nuclear Alliance Metttber
Tom Ellis also cites tltc rising costs
resulting frorn federal restrictions

 
 
  

 

and regulations placed on all
nuclear power plants. According to
Ellis, theKornanOff audit estimates
these costs at a half billion dollars.
If the PCS votes to shut down the
plattt, Foster feels tlte decommis-
sioning fees should be paid by the
trtility shareholders and not by the
consumer. However, Niagara
Mohawk said they will have to raise
consumer rates in order tomake up
for loses, probably by spreading the
rate ltikcs over a few years accor-
ding to the Times Union article.
Hearings, which began last week.
will cutttinue through this Friday.
After this time, caclt side will sub-
trtit a summary of their position to
the PSC, in anticipation of the com-
mission's decision this January.

Mall Are Proposed I

Western Avenue ramp, Cltiids
noted, “The DOT will not give its
final approval unless they agree to
build it. . . but tlte trafﬁc and
pollution problcttts will exist ,with or
without the proposed P-sltaped
loop."

However, Crossgates Attorney
Michael Sltanley said Pyramid is

ttot ready to “spend nearly 115‘

million to build the ramp. Shanlcy
added that widening the Western
Avenue bridge. and building

separate entrances and exits to the
mail. which Pyratnid has already
proposed doing, should be suffi-
cient to deal with the trafﬁc that

  
 
 

vould arise.

. Cltilds cotnplaincd, "The Board
.s plartrting on making its decision
in seven days — without the DOT's
final recommendation. . . nothing
has come from the DOT yet."

in another development, Zoning
Board Co-Counsel Ralph Mancini
has advised the board that he will
not be giving any more Crossgates-

' related advice due”to' a conflict of
'nlerest. A client of Mancinl's law
firm has ownership interest in land
optioned by Pyramid.

Also at the meeting last Wednes-
day, the zoning board voted 5—2 to
close the public hearings on the mall
and make its decision December 16.

SUNYA Affirmative Action Officer Gloria DeSole

Published a pamphlet on sexual harassment to promote education

objectionable to the recipient.
which causes the recipient discom-
fort or humiliation, or which in-
tcrfcru; with the recipient’s educa-
tional or.,ob performance.

“Sewal harassment, like rape,
has very little to do with sex and a
great deal to do with power; and the
university center, with power rela-
tionships integral to its structure, is
an environment in which sexual
harassment is common," said Risa
Fausette of the Office of Affir-
mative Action;

,DeSolc said she hepes the pam-
phlet _will increase consciousness of
sexual harassment. in addtion to
publishing the pamphlet, 26 sexual
harassment advisors were trained
this semester to raise the issue in
their departments and serve as
counselors to any student of their
school Or department who feel they

have been sexually harassed.

“A majority of tire advisors are
women because the majority of
cases we get involve women harass-
ed by men. it would be less in-
timidating for a woman who has
been harassed to speak to another
woman, and confide in her,"
Fausctt explained. DeSole said
there has been only one case
reported to her office of a male be-
ing harassed. .

DeSolc pointed out that once a
complaint has been make, the ad-
ministrators who deal with it are
mostly men. Mary. the sexual
harassment victim described earlier,
said this had been afproblem for
her. “i had to make them unders~
land that l was a serious' student.
Some of them did not even under:-
tand sexual harassment as a pro.
