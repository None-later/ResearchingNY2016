At Arizona State, for example,
the issue ‘sparked a round of pro-

Over _ the last three academic
years, various California student
groups have sued to regain student
fees. that-"have 'paid for abortion
counseling. The most recent at-
tempt came at San Diego State,
where dozens of students withheld
their student fees in protest. A state
judgo‘cVehtually ruled the use of
student fees for abortions was per-
rnissible.

Reagan Suspects Plot

WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) Presi-
dent Reagan rejected Monday Col.
Moarnmar Khadafy's denial
that Libyan terrorists itave been
sent to the United States to kill
government leaders. “i wouldn't
believe a word lte says," Rcagatt
declared. "We have the evidence
and he knows it." ,'

The president, in a brief meeting
with ‘reporters. left open the
possibility of punitive steps against
lite Khadafy_ government. Asked if
he would seek a boycott of Libyan
oil or other economic sanctions,
Reagan replied only tltatﬁ‘Thcrcr
ltave been no decisions made."

White House and State Depart-
ntcnt officials said‘U.S. economic
artd political relations with Libya
itavc been uttdcr review for at least
two months. State Department
spokesperson Dcatt Fischer said tltc
step was takctt with a view toward
dcaling‘tvitlt Libya‘s "terrorist ac-
tivities.”

The purported Libyan plot and
possible econorttic retaliatiort
against. Libya were among topics
for Reagan's afternoon meeting
with the National Security Cottrtcii.

Meanwhile, the president‘s wife
Nancy, expressed her owrt cottccrtt
about the purported threats artd
said the increased security precau-
tions may even prevcttt the first

But “i am very happy to have

it ," she said of the tiglttettcd protec-
tiort.
_ Reagan spoke. briefly with
reporters about the purported Li-
byanthrcal a day after Khadafy
denied arty intent to kill Reagan or
other global leaders and challenged
the United States to prove such a
plot, Lu  - .

White House deputy press'
secretary Larry Speakes said he was
not "aware of any plans to tttake
cvidcrtce public. ' -

lrt art intctview Sunday with ABC
News, Kltadat'y said, “We are sure
we haven't sent any people to kill
Reagan or arty other people in the
world."

,Kitttda‘fy called Reagan “silly”
and “ignorant” to believe the
assassination reports and “a liar”
to sptcad them.

Spcukcs refused to elaborate on
Reagan’s response. Although of-
ficials have acknowledged security

A May, 1981 national survey by
the Washington Post found similar
results, with 10 percent inalterabiy
opposed to abortion, and the re-
mainder in fav0r of it; in varying
degrees.

-'Student attitudes toward abor-
tion seem to‘reflect those of the
public at large, according to a re-
ccnt Stanford study. “Students are
struggling more and more with the
issue of 'abortion, but what they

ultimately do hasn't cltartged a
lot," said Dr. John Dorman of
Stanford.

National Statistics for abortions
among college wotnctt do ttot exist.
But spot checks suggest abortion is
a frequently-chosen alternative.

‘ At the (ittincsvlllc Women's
Health Certtcr ttext to the Universi-

‘ty' of Florida, about 30-50 abortions

per week are performed. Most, ac-
cording to Nancy Breeze, art area
counselor, were for lB-to-Z4-year-
old single, white wontett having

 

 ‘Heatedlssue onCollege Campuses

their first pregnancy.

However, Breeze points out that
the center draws wornen from all
over north Florida. -

There have been about 200 abor-
tions reported per‘-year_sittce 1977
among Cornell women, though
some university ofﬁcials speculate
unreported operations might swell
the number to 400.

The university made just 60 abor-
tion referrals in l97l-72, its first
year of existence.

“l wduid like to believe (college
women) are not getting abortions
with the same kind ofimpunity that
they did in the past,“ Dorman said.
"There is a greater concern artd sett-
sitivity that students go tltrottgit
‘over abortion, but their crtd deci-
slon is still the saute."

I"We do have many members on
college campuses," said Dart
Doncltey of Rigltt to Life's national
o‘ffice itt Washington. Right To
Life, ltowcvcr, docs ttot ltave “arty
programs specifically aimed at the
college market."-

The American Life Lobby (ALL)
does. Last year, ALL organized a
special department to coordinate
anti-abortion efforts on campuses.
“We’re tryittg to organize all the
college Rigltt to Life groups itt the
:ottntry,“ said Jim Degcr, director
of the Life issues itt Formal Educa-
tiort (LIFE) division of ALL.

“We plan to develop sottte form
of cooperation, sharing and ex-
change of ideas among the 50,000
college' studertts rtationwidc who
belong to college pro-life groups.”

Deger says LIFE gives “the
(organizing) tccltttoiogy to college
groups that they cart use. This is tlte
greatest area we can be of aid in."

He also aims to defuse 'pro-

o..r,g.......r.,....,,,.‘_

abortion efforts.

“Right now the biggest prggram ,_
is the awareness project of the U.S.
Student Association, he said.
USSA “lobbies for abortion on
Capitol Hill. Most students are not
even aware their student govern-
ments are members. We want to
make people aware of what their
student activity dollars are going
for." “a

LIFE also is trying to establish
“maternal aid funds" for female
stttdents who opt to carry their
pregnancies to term rather titan get
abortions.

Planned Parenthood's Davidoff
felt "we're still in a stale ofinactivi-
ty and passivity” that is allowittg
Right to Life groups to gain un-
citeckcd momentum on campuses.

Site hopes to "see a rcsttrgertce of
campus-related activities if young
people feel their rights to free
choice are being threatened.“

One of the ntost active pro-
ttbortiott groups on campuses is
probably the Harvard Scientists for
Reprodttctive FreedonturlSRF),
which has launcited petition drives
to discredit unscientific contentions
that life begins at eottception.

The tttix of militant anti-abortion
groups and defensive abortion ad-
vocates frequently has proven ex-
plosive. Last semester protests and
counter-protests marched across tltc
Micitigatt State campus as groups
ttoisily argued wltctlter to stop the
MSU Clinical Center front perfor-
tttittg abortions.

"We do ttot have an abortion
clittic. We ttever did have ottc, and
we never pianttcd to establish one,"
says William Scitombein of the

_ V clinical center. "it was a_m.oot issue '

all along.“ 

Affirmative Action Ofﬁce Examines Sexual Harassment 

continued from from page

blem." “That is why educating is so
important. if people are aware of
sexual harassment, they can better
deal with it when a problem arises,"
DcSoie stated.

DcSolc said it is difficult to iden-
tify harasscrs after tltc sequence of
events has takcrt place, and that so
many cases go uttrcportcd. ‘

in the past two years the Office
of Affirmative Action has dt .lt
with at least two dozett complaints,
concerns, and inqttiries, DeSole
said. “Many dozens of women have
asked me questions that have led me
to believe tltcy itavc more tltart a
passing interest in the subject."

Randi Bregmatt who worked for

the. New York Public interest

Research Group (NYPIRG) on
legislation to aid sexual harassment
victims, explained action pcttding
regarding the issttc. Ottc bill would
allocate ttttctttpioytttcttt colttpcttstt-
tiort to persons who leave their jolts
due to sexual harassment; another
bill would subsidize attorneys’ fees
for those initiate scxttal harassment

But Bregtnan said she does not
tltittk legislation is the most effec-
tive way to deal with the problem of
sexual harassment. Site cxplaitted
sexual harassment goes deeper than
anytltittg legislation could change.
Tltcrc needs to be a change itt ut-

best way to change attitudes is

‘through education."
