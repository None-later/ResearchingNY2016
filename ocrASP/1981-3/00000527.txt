Old Saint Nick is happy because he remembered that
Friday’s ASP is the last one this semester, and got his
last personal in before it was too late. That’s right,
Friday’s issue is the last one of the semester, so you’d better get that
personal in for your special someone. The classified deadline’ I
for the last issue is today at 3:30 p.m. All classified ads will
be accepted in the ASP business office — Campus Center 329.
