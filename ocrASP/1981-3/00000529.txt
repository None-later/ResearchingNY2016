' JIV. Danes Drop Two

ll) Mam: Haspel

the Albany State junior varsity
L;t.kutbal| team dropped its second
gaunt: in a row Friday evening as
they fell to RP] over in Troy by a
score of 87-84.

The game was a closeonc until
'the beginning of the sccti'nd half
when, according to head coach
Dave Pryzbylo, the .l.V. Danes
simply fell apart. As a result, the
Engineers were able to increase
their lcadpvcr Albany by as much
as 14 points during the second half.
Albany battled to within five
points, but had to foul in order to
get the ball back.

RPl's Dietrich ttscd the Dane
fouling to his advantage as he
scored 30 points on the nightI 16 of
which came from the free throw
line.

Albany shot 35 percent from the
field against RP] and was led by the
fine outside shooting of Tom Hull
who matched Dictrich's effort with
30 points. ,

Otbcr Danes scoring in double
figures in the contest included Mike
Brand with 15 points, ccntcr Pete
Gosulc.‘ who added 12 and Dave
Anderson. who contributed to
points to the Dane cause.

A sharp improvement was noted
by Pryzbyio in the department ol
rebounding. Against Union. in their
previous contest, Albany had dif-
ﬁculties under the boards, but

against RPI. the Danes pulled down

The loss pttt Albany's record at
2-2. But. Pryzbylo cautioned that it
will take time for this young team
containing only two sophomores
and the rest l'rcslttttan to start play-
ing well together.

"This team has all good

Even in defeat thc Albany State
women's gymnastics team shows
great promise. The mostly
freshman squad lost to a strong
Division 1 Northeastern squad and
to Division it Long island Universi-
ty on Saturday. but broke too
points for the ﬁrst time ever in an
opening match.

“it's a really positive sign for
us," said Albany gymnastics coach
Pat Duval-Spillanc, who explained
that the tougher competition early
in the season should help the team
when they meet Division iii op-
ponents later in the season.

The Danes scored l03.3 points,
but Northeastern won the meet with
l24.7 and Long island University
placed second with 106.8. Albany
was within .5 points of LlU until
the last cvcnt, floor exercise, when
they pulled away. .

“Their two girls scored real well.
Those two got I] points — that beat
us," said Drivel-Spillane. “l was a
little surprised by our scores in the
ﬂoor exercise."

The coach noted that the Dane

in a Row

have to be patient. Once they do
that, titcy should be a lmt'd'tcnnt to
heat."

Albany's next opponent is West
Point. The Danes always have llnll-
blc against this team attd accottliny
to Pryxbyio, the Cadets are tough
this season too.

“But.” IIC‘COnlinlILd. “we're due
for a good game." ‘
