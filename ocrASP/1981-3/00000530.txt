were unable to get it together offen-
sively.

Trailingby six points at halftime
irt Oswcgo lasr week. Albany went
to their zone press forcing many
turnovers which resulted in fast
trrcaks for the Danes. '

"We were down by as many as 10
points in the .sccond half," said
Albany coach 'Amy Kidder. “But
otrr zone press, steals. and layups
cttublcd us to cltip away at their lead
until we finally tied it up at 52 with
two minutes to go." Titc rctnaindcr
of tltc game was scoreless and tltc
final bur/cr sounded with both
teams having scored 52 points

Thc ot'ctrintc pct'iod saw many
lead changes but tltc key was three
foul shotssunk in the last minute by
Oswcgo‘s Bctit Thompson. “Timc
was ticking away and we hadn‘t
scotcd so Wc wct'c forced to go for
tltc hall." said Kiddcr.
