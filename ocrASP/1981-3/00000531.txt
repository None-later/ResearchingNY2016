When the Albany State women's

swimming and diving team hosted .

RH and Oneonta.Saturday at
University Pool, they wanted to
prove a few things.

The Danes wanted to prove that
after losing to Mount Holyoke
three days before, they could re-
lround to victory in their next

outing. But ilrat wasn't all. Albany ‘

needed to show that tltc breaking of
seven school records was not just a
fluke.

But it wotrld be no easy task. in
this double htcct, RPl did not pose
mttch of a threat‘, but Oneohta was
a different story. Albany had never
beaten the Dragons, whose swimm-
ing schedule at this point in the
season has thctn at their peak since
they do not cotnpete in the second
semester. But the Danes did this
time. Not only did Albany wallop
RPl 112-18, but they also defeated
Oneonta 94-46.

A tribute to Albany's perfor-
mance on Saturday was that,
besides the fact that they once again
broke seven school-records (some of
which had been set against Mount
Holyoke), most of the women
achlevcd new personal lows, prov-
ing to head coach Dulce Fernandez
their constant drive to improve.

“When they set their minds to do
something, they do it plus some
more," said Fernandez.

Albany’s most satisfying win of
the day came in the 200 medley
relay. Fernandez explained that
Oneonta had felt prior to the event
that their times wduld be more thah

sufficient to beat out the Danes.
However, the team of Sue Keilty,
Lauriann Baines, Ann Hoch and
Sheila Fitzpatrick combined to set a
new varsity record of 2:03.17
hesting Oneonta by well over two
seconds. The previous mark had
been set agaitrst Mount Holyoke.
Fitzpatrick went on to turn in
what Fernandez called “ the amaz-
ing record of the day” in the 100
yard freestyle. She clocked a
0:59.13 to take first place in that
event. It was the first time that any
woman has broken a mlntttc in this
event at this scltool. The Dunes also
grabbed a' third place as Barb Van

Slyke had her pcrsotrai best time
with a 1:03.26.

The Danes chalked up another
first place in the 50 yard
backstroke. Keilty, bested her own
personal mark with a 0:31.05, while
freshtnan Carol Higgins also reach-
ed a personal low time with a fine
0:35.6. Higgins grabbed fourth
place in that event.

Baincs added a first place to the
Danes' cause in the 50 yard
breaststroke with a time of 0:35.5,
while Carol Lim placed itr second
with a new personal low of 0:36.51.

Keilty provided' Albany with
another first place in the 100 yard

backstroke as she broke the school
mark with a 1:08.48. Also, Baincs
did “an excellent time" iii the 100
1M in which she came in first. Sltc
hit a personal low time of 1:11.48.
in that event, second place went to
Van Slyke with a time of 1:14.20.
Fitzpatrick was victorious again
in the 200 yard freestyle. Site won
that event and broke her own per-
sonal record with a 2:10.58. Betsy

Kwasman took second with a time
of 2:223.

cond attd was followed in fourth

sonal best tinrc of 2:46.02.

Albany closed this fine double
victory in fitting fashion by produc-
ing “the most outstanding 200
medley you ever saw," in the words
of Fernandez,

Albany’s entry of Hoch, Lim,
Keilty and Fitzpatrick smashed the
old school mark in this event by rac-
ing to a time of 1:48.4. For Kei-
ly and Fitzpatrick it was cer-
tainly a fitting ending to a fantastic
day. Each broke records in
everything they swam during the
course of the afternoon.

The Danes now boast an im-
pressive record of 4-1.

Williams Upsets Danes in the Berkshire Classic

by Larry Kuhn

'When Albany merWilliams in
the ﬁnal of the Berkshire Classic
basketball tournament on Sunday
afternoondhe question in most. peo-
plc's minds was not who would win,
but by how much Albany would
win.

“The night before the Danes had
humiliated North Adams, the home
team, with a merciless offensive
display. They defeated 'hc

Mohawks by 33 points, 94-61.-

Williams was largely unimpressivc
in their 80-75 triumph over' Keene
State.

And for the first 17 and a half
minutes of the title game Albany
did nothing to put any doubts in
anybody's mind. They scored the
ﬁrst seven points and ran up a 30-16
lead on the strength of 15 points by
freshman Dan Croutier.

But then the game turned coma-
pleter around. Williams reeled off
13 Straight points at the end of the
half and c105ed the gap to a single
point. The Ephmen dominated the
second half with tough defense and
upset the Da_ncs. 65-57.

“1 think the key was our
defe c," said Williams basketball
Robert Peck. “They forced
o a man-to-man defense,

in. i ess we’re stronger in it than 1
tho t."

the start of the second hart
it w up 1.0 either team 10 assert
the lves,” noted Albany coach

Dick'Sauers. “They did."
The cause of the Danes'
cautiousnm was foul trouble.

      

 

Croutier and Joe Jednak each had
three ﬁrst half fouls and John
Dieckelman, Mike Gallo and Jan
Zadoorian each had two. Williams
had only three as a team. Seven ol
their 13 points at the end of the half
were tltc result of free throws, as
they entered a bonus situation.
The second half was all Williams.
Senior eo-captain Al Lewis pumped
in nine points in the first 10 minutes

 3.3.1718: ,

and their defense, along with some
horrendous shooting by Albany,
gave the Ephmen a 47-36 advan-
tage. The Danes closed to within
three points with five mintttcs re-
maining in the game on jump shots
by Wilson Thomas and Ron Sim-

mons, but they could get no closer:

Williams, scoring mostly on free
throws, increased their lead to 10
points before the Danes added a

score.

“1 wanted to control the tempo,

team that controls the tempo is in

Frayed Lamp Wire is Suspected

by Lisa Mirabella

Nothing remained in the room to
identify it as a college dorm 'except
for a charred and ash-covered desk
among a pile of indistinguishable
burnt belongings. .

A fire on the 14th floor of State
Qtrad's Eastman Tower Wednesday
evening destroyed tltc roonr of Tina
Levy and Ellen .Binder.

It took the Albany Fire Depart-
ment 15 minutes to extinguish tltc
flames, which were contained in
one of the three bedrooms in suite
1402, and, according to llrttullion
Chief Ralph Dawn, there was corr-
siderable smoke and water damage
to the rest of the suite and to other
rooms on the floor.

No cttscs of pctsotrttl injury were
reported; the three wotnett in the
suitcroom wrrcn the fire broke otrt
were able to leave sni‘cly.‘

Dianne l’ine discovered the the
Wednesday night as she and
suitcntntcs Binder and Madelyn
Kclstein went to bring their garbage
downstairs.

“We were about to leave. I smell-
ed smoke and opened tltc door to

their (Levy and Binder's) room.
The lamp was on fire and both beds
were starting to burn," Pine said.

Pine said she ltad to stop Binder
from going back itrto the room, arid
did not have a chance to close the
bedroom doors.

"When we got out to the hall,
Ellen pttllcd the alarm twice before
it sounded ntttl we went down the
stairs," she said. v

Other students spoke of duwdlittg
while leaving the building and trot
taking the alarm seriously.

“When you Item tt i‘itc ttlttttn yotr
think it's at false alarm — and if it is
a fire, it‘s a snntli one. 1 think even
the firemen were surprised about
this one,“ said Sal l’ccorclla, who
was in 1403 when the fire
started. .

The cause of Hit: the has not bcett
determined, according to Karl
Sclttul of tire Dcpztttrrtcnt of Public
Safety.

The Albutty Fire Department
reported Wednesday night that they
believed the fire was caused by a
frayed wire iii a lamp that shorted
out, creating a spark which lit the

of the room.

f‘l'm upset that it's school pro-
perty that allegedly caused the
fire," Pine said yesterday as she
cleared her belongings out of a
soot-covered room.

The women in the room were also
concerned that the smoke and fire
detectors were not working proper-
ly in the rooms and suites.

“We never heard an alarm. Tire
whole room was on fire and that
alarm didn’t go off," said Pine. Sire
poittted to the melted renraintlcr of
a treat alarm on the wall of the
btrrned roortt.

Physical Plant Director Dennis

Albany Common Council Passes ’82 City Budget

by Elizabeth Reich

The Albany Cotntnon Cottncil
voted 14-1 Monday to pass the $76
million city budget for 1982 which
Mayor Erastus Corning submitted
three weeks ago, without revisions
or amending an, apparent $300
'milli'on‘typographical error, the
Dcputv Controller in the mayor’s
office confirmed.

The $75,992,360 budget, which
was proposed 16 days after the
fiscal year began, shows total city
spending up 7.7 percent from
1981's $70,558,000 budget, accor-
ding to the November 17 Times-

 

Or

   
 
   

If you have been dreaming of it Wllllt‘ Christmas, then your dream
has been answered a little lrlt early. ’l‘uestiuy’s snbwfull blanketed the
hirer! with at least four inches of snow, creating a world of white. J

Union.

According to that same article,
the bttdgct carries with it a total tax
levy of $25,290,051, as opposed to
1981 budget‘s levy of $23.7 million.

The new budget includes a total
of $100,000 worth of raises for the
mayor and other city officials. Cor-
ning's salary will rise by $8,000.
from ($25,000 to $33,000. Corning
had stated that his proposed raise of
32 percent was an increase of 8 per-
cent a year, not compounded. The
entire raise was budgeted beginning
in 1982 because a state law dictates
that the mayor's salary must remain

Other officials whose salaries will
be raised include City Comptroller
James Brunet anti City Treasurer
Raymond Joyce .Ir. from $22,270
each to $30,030; incoming Com-
rnon Council President Thomas
Wltalcrr to $13,860 from the
$10,500 paid outgoing President
James Giblin; and the 15 city
aldermcn to $7,260 from $5,500.

Corning‘s pay increase will give
him the 8th highest mayoral salary
in New York State. Corning ex-
plains that less tltan half of the
$100,000 pay-raise appropriation
will be used in raises for elected of-
ficials; the rest will be used to in-
crease department heads’ pay.

The general fund, which reﬂects
the city's daily spending will in-
crease 12 percent in 1982, from
$51,200,000 to $57,365,390, as dic-

Sales tax revenue will increase
$1.8 million, or 26 percent, to
$8,582,665, although in fiscal year

1981 the city realized $6,523,854 of:

the budgeted $6,795,000 sales tax
revenue.

Corning accounted for this- new
sales tax distribution formula ap-
proved by Albany County last sum-
mer and a projected increase in
total sales accounts.

Another major increase in
revenues is the $3 million in fees
from the state during 1982 for its
resource recovery system known as
ANSWERS (Albany New York
Solid Waste Energy Recovery
System). The city didn't receive any
of the $1,625 million budgeted as
ANSWERS revenue from the state
in fiscal 1981, because the state fail-
cd to complete its portion of the

that the case was dismissed she was

According to the Ti/nav-Ultt'mr,
District Attorney Sol (‘rrccrrlrerg

interest of avoiding duplicity of
itctuituts ltlltl ill the interest of SitV:

Corning claims that the state
owes the city that amount under the
contract governing the ANSWERS
project; '

'The‘ city's plan for selling the
land adjoining Union Station to the
state for a redevelopment project
has been allocated $1.2 million.

Last year, the city tried to
balance the budget with revenues
from the sale of city property, but
received only $48,383 of $750,000
budgeted.

Corning cut spending by enforc-
ing a ﬂat 6 percent reduction on the
spending proposals submitted by
