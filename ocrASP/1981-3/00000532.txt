versi ns “by as much as tens of billions of dollars" and
also overestimates the increase in air pollution coa'l fuel
would cause. '

York City owned by Consolidated Edison. three owned
by the Long island Lighting Co.. one owned by Orange
& Rockland Utilities. Inc.. in Roekland County. one
owned by the Central Hudson Electric & Gas 0).. it?
