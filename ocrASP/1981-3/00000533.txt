Kris Kringle: Portrait Of A “Imposte‘r

by Debbie Judge

It's best to he mttndancly factual
when faced with art utianswetablc
question; the easiest article to write
is straight news. It‘ you wzrni to find
ortt who Santa Claus is, you talk to
him yottrscll'.

I hate to admit it was citsict iii
I968. In thosc tltrys you could go up
rind sit on the old man‘s hip and
talk l‘otcwt, and Ilrcic \\tt.s trortc ol‘
this rush-in, rush-out that there is
now. The line at the colossttl ticc til
Colonic (cittcr winds around likc
endless ctrrltinri, and :i l\\’cltl_\‘—)'L'tlt-

old stands out like a branch to be
pinned. If you want to be adult
about it, you make an appointment.
And then you find a gciittitrclyjolly
rrriddIc-atred man in red and while
waiting iii the dressing room.

“Oh. he‘s good,” the girl in
'clirttgc ot‘ the photographs says,
leading the way littck‘ to thc trtti tow,
clultcicd dressing room. “I tltiirk
sortictinics he actually thinks he's
Stinta Chins."
