A committee of students and ad-
ministration officials at SUC-
B:o:kport have reached an agree-
ment on ways to revamp that
school's Student Union snack bar,
which had been the target of a
boycott earlier this semester.

Some of the proposals. including
a reduction in prices of some items.
will go into effect at the beginning
of the spring semester. January 26.
Changes in dccorI scaling ar-
rangcmcrits and new serving lines
will take placc next fall.

The Brockport snack bar is
similar in function to the Campus
Center cafeteria. Thc Brockport
Student Govcriliiicnt (BSG) lcd a
boycott of the snack bar for two
\vccks in October. protesting the
raising ol‘ prices. sortie of which
were more than double the prcvious
school ycttrs' levels.

[350 student affairs coordinator
Stuart Friedman at the time termed
the boycott “extremely ct‘l'cctivc."
Sandra Conlcs. thc exccutivc direc-
tor ol‘ the Faculty-Student Associa—
tion, which runs the snack bar. coli-
ccdcd that business had dropped off
during the boycott, but noted it is
now back to normal.

According to Friedman. 16 items

inthe snack bar will be reduced in
price. However reductions will be
relatively small, he said.

Friedman said inﬂation prevents
further decreases. “The price of a
tuna cup went down from $1.55 to
$1.40. Now that's still pretty high
and double from last year. But the
(FSA) says the price of tuna has
simply skyrocketed.”

Friedman said that oncl‘way the
committee recommended that costs
be cut Is through improving the
preparation of the food and altering
some ingredients. “Thch wcrc pro-
blems that management was just
not aware of." he said.

The snack bar renovations, which
are cxpccted to be approved by
Brockport president John Van Wet-
tcring, include the joining of it to
the rest of the Student Union. The
snack bar had at one time bccn used
as a dining hall.

The snack bar will also be
redecorated and room will be made
for new serving lines to accom-
modate baked goods and other
specialty items.

But Coatcs said construction will
not start until the summer rcccss.
“We don‘t want to sink money into
anything that we may change
later." The actual cost ol‘ the pro-
ject has yet to bc dclcrniincd.
