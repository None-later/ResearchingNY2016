December; 11,198].

by Steve Hornheck

In the ﬁrst days of January I964.
Jack Ruby, the nightclub owner
who pushed through the crowd of
reporters in the Dallas police station
basement and shot alleged presiden-
tial assassin Lee Harvey Oswald on
national television. sat in his jail cell
dying of cancer. Ruby was nervous.
according to author William
Malone in Tire Secret Life of Jack
Ruby . . . but not about his il-
lness. “They‘re going to find out."
he told a visitor. "about my trips to
Cuba . . . and the guns and

everything."

was only a logical progression in the
career of the Kennedy brothers. as

was fighting the rtriirrg forces from
the rrrorrntairrs of the Cuban coun-
tryside and tire Mafia allegedly
delivered shipments of arms to hint.
Their reasoning. according to Art-
son. was that irt the event Castro
should assume power. he would be
inclined to protect mob interests.
However. Castro didn't see
things that way when he overthrew
the Battista government on New
Year's Day. I959. One of his first
acts was to confiscate all mob pro-
pcriles and. soon after, threw Sart-

losses were estimated in the hun-
dreds of millions and much anger
was directed at President Kennedy
for failing to protect mob interests
as Well as.failure to take steps
towards eliminating Castro.

The Mafia allegedly began to col-
laborate with the CIA in plots to
assassinate the Cuban leader. At the
same time it is theorized that
another plart. dealing directly with
the Kenncdys was begun. artd Jack
Ruby was part of it.

Rrrby was born in Chicago. in
I‘ll]. According to Anson. Ruby
entered the world of organi/cd
crime as tt teenager. running
numbers for Al Capone and became
ruorc and more involved ill the
mob.

ln I939. Anson continues. Ruby.
then a secretary to a Chicago trrriorr.
was arrested for the murder of a

'union treasurer only to be later

released for lack of evidence.
Robert Kennedy. in his l‘)60 book
on organi/ed crime. The lz‘Itt’Itty
ll"t'IIr/'Ir. called the nutrch “a key
step in the nrob‘s rise toward
domination met the tcamstcrs."
About this time. according to a
lawyer from the Kcltttrvct ('ommis—
siorr on Crime. Rttby began
associating with Sam (iiancorta.

ltt I947. Ruby moved to Dallas
arid Malone states. according to
recently released I-Ili docrrrrrerrrs.
Rtrby becarrre known as “the pay
oi'l trratt for the Dallas police
department."

In the late I‘)50s. according to
Malone. Lewis .I. MeWillic,
gtrnrtmncr and manager of sercrai
illegal gambling houses in Dallas.
went to Havana to help rrtn tnob
operations and. according to the
FBI. became close with Santos
’l‘r'al'l‘icantc. McWiIlic was also
good friends with Jack Ruby.

About this titrrc. Malone argues.
Ruby scents to Iravc hccorrre involv-
ed in running grrrts to Cuba for the
mob. After the assassination. two
wotncrt came forward to the FBI
and said that. in I958 irr l-lavana.
they had been introduced to Jack
Ruby and were told he was rrrrrning
guns to Castro. 7

After Santos Trafficante was
thrown ill a Cuban prison in I959,
Rtrby made many rrrorc trips to
Cuba and may Irave been involved
in negotiations to free the mobster.

Studies Shed Light on Ruby’s

A few days after the assassination.
according to Malone. a British jour-
nalist reported that. while he was
brieﬂy jailed in Cuba. he met a
“gangster-type" named Santos who
"was visited frequently by another
American gangster-type named
Ruby."

During mid-195?. according to
IAnson. Rttby contacted Robert
McKeown. arms-smuggler and
close friend of Fidel Castro's. for
help in securing the release of cer-
tain people from a Cuban prison.
At one point. Malone reported.
Ruby offered $25,000 to MeKeown
for a letter of introduction to
Castro. However. Ruby never came
through with the offer. Sontctime
ater. ire went to visit MeWiIlie in
Cuba. On July 8. Castro ordered
Trafl'ieantc deported.

After Trafficantc‘s release,
Malone wrote. Ruby‘s Cuban ac—
tivities scent to have stopped. but
Iris contacts with other mobsters in-
creased. Recently. federal irr-
vcstigators itr Florida identified two
Miami hotel rooms as the locations
of two meetings betwecrt Ruby and
mobster .loltn Roselli durug the two
months before the assassination.
Roselli. in the years following. lrad
told investigative reporter .lr_rcL
Anderson. that Rtthy was "one of
otrr boys.“

preceding the assassination Ruby
made a series of long-distance
phone calls to several organized
crime ﬁgures —‘ all connected with
Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters.
Malone asserted that Ruby
alwaysfeared his gun-running to
Cuba might be made public. He
worried this would cause him who
viewed as unpatriotic. Ruby told his
psychiatrist he was blackmailed into
shooting OsWald by people who
threatened to reveal his Cuban ac-
