Jack Ruby
cnnlt’mterlfrm1t page nine

President Kennedy, ‘wltom Trai-
fieante bitterly attacked. saying.
" . . . titis man Kennedy is in
trouble. and he will get what is cont-
ing to ltim."- Wlten Aletnan
disagreed. arguing tltat Kennedy
would be re-electcd. Trafficante
allegedly responded. “No, Jose. he
is going to he hit."

Trafficantc‘s answer to all the
House Committee's questions was
the satne: a refusal to answer pur-
suant to constitutional rights
against self-incrimination. ln-
vestigators from the corntnittec said
that Trafficante was visibly trembl-
ing when served tlte subpoena to ap-
pear, and perhaps for good reason.
His associates Sam Giancana and
Joint Roselli were botit murdered
by unknown assailants shortly
preceding or following qucslioning
related to the assassination before
Senate committees.

The Warren commission in-
vcsligaiing tltc assassination was
presented with none of the evidence
concerning Ruby‘s Mafia connec-
lions.

"I "awfully realize that only
the powers of the Presidency
will reveal IIIe secrets of my
brother’s (lea/I1. "

fiscal l98l. althottglt‘ 591.500 was
budgeted for that purpose. This
year. tlte budgeted sutn more than
quadrupled to a “more realistic
figure" of $525,000 as Corning
labeled it.

Opponents of the budget were
angered by tile fact that it was
adopted by tltc Common Council
immediately after the hour-long
public hearing. They felt that tlteir
suggestions had ttot been given ade-
quate consideration, as Harold
Rubin. president of the Council of
Albany Neighborhood Associa-
lions. complained in the December
ll issue of the Tilllt’S-Uliltlll.

The only opposing vote was cast
by Alderman Nancy Burton. who
felt that the budget fails to include
projections for maintenance plans
for city buildings or capital spen—
ding.

Cynthia (ittllivan. co-cltairtnan
ol‘ a citi/cns committee working on
the budget. pointed ottt tttt ttppatcnl
typographical error of $300 tnilliott
itt federal aid. This did not inhibit
the bttdgct's passage.
