*‘Gatto’s15 Leads Scorers
Second . Win in Conference

by Biff Fischer v
ruvrrsauadn Spearheaded by
a dominating defense, the Albany
Great Danes outscored Plattsburgh
28-7 over the final 11 minutes
Wednesday night, and went on to
pull away to a 61-40 SUNY Cort-
fercnce Win over the host Cardinals.

Wednesday's victory puts Albain
on top of the SUNYAC East slan-
dings witlt a 2-0 mark. Potsdam and
Cortland face off tonight in Cor-
tland, with the winner tying the
Danes for the top spot.

Although Plattsburgh rtever led
in the contest, the Cardinals stayed
lit the game throughout the first 30
minutes by porrndirtg the offensive
boards. Coach Not 111 Law's tcanr
pulled dowrt 15 offensive rebounds,
while Albany crtrrld manage only 19
defensive boards, many of whiclt
came in the final 10 minutes, wher
rlte Dartes ptrt the game away.

Albany grabbed thc first lean ol
the game when .lolrrr Dicckclrnan
scored off of the first of eight Dun
Croutier assists for a 2—() Dane lcarl.
Law was forced to.cul| a time-out
when Albany. sparked by three
Mi'.e Gallo hoops, also scorcd it)
oft te next 12 points for a 12-2 lead
at 14:55 of the first half. lint lltc
Cardinals ‘aruc back, cutting the
visitors’ lead trt 20-16 at 2:32, and
the half ended with each learn scor-
ing once rnrrre for a 22-lii Albany
lead at the intermission.

When tltc Danes have struggled

this season, it has been their
shooting tirat has abandoned them.
Wednesday, the Albany club shot
56.3 percent from the floor, 59.3
percent in the decisive second half.
The key marksmen Were Gallo,
who was 7 of 11, and Dieckelman, a
5 of 8 shooter. it was especially
encouraging for Albany fans to see
Gallo have a big night, sirtcc the
Oswego native had been _having
problems withhis outside shot.
The second half picked up where

  
 
 
   

 

the first had left off, with Albany

still in possession of a very tenuous,
lead. It was built to seven twice, at
30—23 and 32-25, but it was ltcre that

"Plattsburgh outscored the Danes

8-1 over a stretch of 3:24 to pull
even at 33 all. At tltis point, Albany
coach Dick Sauers called time-out,
and also reinserted point guard
Croutier. Both moves paid off for
the Danes.

On a team with four guards, all
freshmen, the first conference road

game is really a stern test. Witlt the

score tied and only 10:51 left, the
time ltad come frtr tlte Danes to
show what they are ntadc of. And,
as is tltc case with all good teartts, it
was the seniors wlto provided the

spark.

Joe Jednak sandwicircd two
jumpers around a Ron Simmons
jumper arid, suddenly, a tie game
had once again become a six point
Albany lead. In only a period of
1:49, tltc two seniors, together with
the 5-7 freshman playmaker
Croutier. had put the victory into
the Danes' hands.

Albany did not relax once they r

ltad regained the lead. The rapidly
improving Wilson Thomas. hit a
driving shot after a Plattsburgh
time-our to ptrt the lead to eight attd
then the Albany defense asserted
itself. The Cardinals were able to
score only seven points irt the last
10:51, and orriy Scored one brrsket

Women Cagers Storm Past Physical New Paltz '

by Lori Cohen

Prepared to fight the snow
storms on their way to New Patty,
the. Albany women's basketball
team found they also had to battle
their way to a very physical win
against New Paltr, 59-32. More ac-
customed to playing ouc-on-onc
streetball. New Fall? found
themselves frustrated against the
Danes' powerful press and 2-1-2
zone defense.

‘fThey had to make up for their

lack of skill by playing extremely
physical. We were worried about
surviving. Everyone played a lot—it
was a necessity of the game, aid
Albany coach Amy Kidder.

Kidder atrd assistant coach Mari
Warner were coming irtto it a little
leery of the New Paltr game. Know—
ing the fashion of ball they play attd
remembering officials irr their past
encounters in tire New Pally area,
they knew the game would be
physically abusive and would

possibly get out of control.

Tltcir fears were well founded.

Rolling up an 18-0 lead after 12
lottg minutes, Albany began to get a
taste of the physical abuse front the
frustrated New Paltr squad.

“We wanted to keep them from
using their onc‘on-onc rnoves,.and
force them to play as a team. We
ltad no plans to use a nttrn-to-man
defense. Using our [titlL' press and
dcfcnsc, causing tltcttt to have to
use each player on the court, we
came tip with a total of 13 steals and
numerous turnovers caused,"
reflected Kiddcr.

New Pttlll' tnan-to-man defense
was tltc cause for Albany's low
scoring iii the first 12 rttirtrrtes. lit
the beginning, instead of quick
passes, Albany prrt the ball to the
floor—at ouccvthey were smothered
by Ncw ’ttlt/ ballplaycts. Oncc this
was corrected, and Albany's pass-
ing began. the Danes began scoring.
The score tn the half was 28-12.

One reason for tire scoring brrrst
in tire second half was ch Sonar/o,
according to Kidrlcrkwlro played
“all outstanding game." Coming
off the bench, Soon/Io scored it)
quick points on 5 for (r shooting,
becoming Albany's high scorer with
ll points. Veronica Patterson, who
was great rrrrdcr llrc hoards, scorctl
rrirtc points and grabbed 12 re-
borrrrds. "We did the best jolt ycr
uttch lltc offensive boards, mainly
because of Ronnie," said Kidder.

Also scoring 9 points were Nancy ~

Wundcrlich and Nancy i-iallorun.

According to Kidder, “Those were
the hardest points Nancy (Halloran)
scored all season.“

As the game progressed“ it
became obvious that tltc referees
ltad lost control. After a flagrant
New Palt/ foul was finally called,
the Danes were awarded a technical
foul, and Jody Currier sank rlte
shot. Currier Went to the line again
on another technical and. scored
again. “We could have played in a
schoolyard. it was not an easy gante
for any of ottr players. The physical
abuse could have inflicted some
serioius injuries," said Kidder.

Defensiver Cltris Cannata and

Rhea Edwards, working together
on the top of the 2-1-2 defense,
played outstanding. “They drove
New Paltz bananas," Kidder said.

Overall, Albatty maintained poise
atrd control in a game that could
have turned irtto a brawl.
Recuperating until Saturday, the
women Danes are hoping to int-
prove their 3-3 record against
Russell Sage.

“If we continue to play the same
way, there is no reason wiry we
should not win,” said Kidder. “We
broke out of ortr scoring slump, and
the buckets finally started to fall."

The 1982-83 proposed State Ex-
ecutive Budget could result in some
major changes to the SUNY system,
ranging front decreased student aid
and fewer faculty artd staff posi-
tions to a I150 dormitory rctrt ltikc.

Governor Hugh Carey proposed
the new budget on January l‘), rrttd
the SUNY Central Administration
is currently analyzing the effects it
will have on the SUNY system.

According to Harry Spindicr,
SUNY Vice Chancellor in charge of
finance, the major impact of the
budget on students will probably be
tltc simullancons hike irt dormitory
t'cut along with cuts irt federal and
state student aid.

The ‘150 per bed risc irr board
rates is part of it plan the State and
the SUNY administration rtgrccrl

have self-sufficient dormitories.
Their goal is to have the dorms sup-
port lhcmselrcs without slrrtc uid.

Groups Target Albany Hilton Hiring

 

iiy MARK HAMMOND

Albany's lilack cotnrttrrttity is
"mad as hell." about the hiring
practices of the new Albany lliltotr
Hotel, accusing tltcrtt of restricting
blacks to menial jobs, according to
Ward 3 Alderman Nebraska Brace.

Of the 48 Blacks employed at the
Hilton, all btrt one are working itt
service or maintenance positions,
raccording to ctnploytnctrt inform-
'tion forwarded to tire state Urban
Development Corporation (UDC)
lby the hotel. Orrc lilack is working
as a desk clerk.

The hotel's report to the UDC
announced a total workforce of
362. with 48 Blacks, 2 Hispanics,

[54 women, and 23 of other
minorities.

“We're rtot getting (minority) ap-
plicartts for tltose position tprofcs»
sionttl and technical)". lliltotr
Operations Manager l’ltil ('oltrrnbo
recently told the Albany 'I‘intcs-
Union. “The people coming itr off
the street are coming for service and
maintenance jolts.“

At Columbo's ordcr, a hiring
frecrc will remain itt effect rtntil the
ltotcl and the UDC work orrt a
specific affirmative action hiring
plan, as required by federal law.

“1 initiated the hiring l'rcc/c and
it will show ottr good faith," Col-
ttrtrbo told the Times-Union.

Are Being Considered

university has a responsibility to
transport Alumni Quad residents to
classes on the uptown campus and
to take uptown students to the
Draper campus, it would not be il-
logical to charge others for use of
the SUNYA shuttle. Stctcns ntrtirv
talus that the Albany campus is the
oirly tttill in the SUNY system which
prmidcs free bus service to non»
dormitory residents, although he
did my tire idctt to charge fares for
thc SUNYA litlSLS “has been
around since I971."

Should a fee be .ruplcrnentcd.
Stevens said. ltc would anticipate
off-selling "personal service costs"
with the money, which be projected
would be in tire area of ‘(rl)<7(),lli)().

Stevens blames the state Division
of Bridget (DOB) for the redrrctiorr
he has been risked to make of nearly
one-third of his present

nutintcnancc costs. Stevens said the
DOB has looked at tltc over
‘lSU,()0() redirected by SUNYA irtto
tltc Plant Department‘s residence-
l'uculty improvement program,
which has gone towards much-
nccdcd repairs and improvement of
residence balls, as a greater amount
rlntrt other SUNY schools prrr
towards rnainlcntutcc and repairs.

Stevens lccls this cut was propos-
ed by the DOB to bring SUNYA‘s
maintenance spending in littc with
that of other SUNY schools.

However. several concerned
students who unexpectedly attend-
ed the bus study committee meeting
feel the fare idea is not a result of
the budget cuts.

SA President Dare i’ologe said
he thinks Stevens “wants to charge
the fee whether the budget cuts go
into effect or not."

UDL‘ spokesman Robert Rafsky
said hotel and UI)C representatives
will meet itt New York City this
week. They hope to develop an af-
firmative action plan which will
result irt spccil'ic and equitable
crnployrttcrrt and ttronctary distrith-
tion.

Officials of botlr the UDC and
the Albany city Office of Equal
izrrrploymcnt Opportunity and Fair
Housing said they iravc been trying
since the hotel's opening in
December to obtain rttinority
ctttploytttctrt information and an af-
firmative action plan.
