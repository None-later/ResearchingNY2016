Mall Zone Maintained

By BRUCE LEVY

 

A last~minutc proposal by
Guiidcrland Town Supervisor
Kevin Moss which could have
blocked construction of the con-
troversial Crossgatcs Mall was
defeated Tuesday night by the
Guilderland Town Board.

Moss asked that the 164 acres of
the Pine Bush, on which the mall is
to he built, as well as two other
areas. be designated as “light in-
tluslty" loncs. Since retail stiles are
not ailo“ ed in light industry loncs.
mall construction \vould‘not have
been allowed.

Moss argued tltat light industry

.\\ould he more compatible with

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS, JANUARY 29, 1,982

suburban Guildcrland than the
shopping center. whth opponents
claim will cause traffic and noise
pollution in the town. Nevertheless.
the board voted down the proposal
3-2. .

Two board members who voted
against the proposal, Virginia
Roma and Donald Cropsey, had
previously come out against the
mall. .Iatnes Cleary also voted
against the proposal. although he
had not taken any position in the
mall.

At the time Moss announced his
plan. both lloran and Cropsey had
objected to voting hastily on the
issue, having only one week to
study it.

Back -in Janitary, I980. Horan
had proposed rezoning the proper—
ty, but her plan was rejected as well.

In August. 1978. the town board
voted to rezone the Pine Bush to
allow construction of the mall.

Environmental Conservation
(EnCon) Commissioner Robert
Flacke approved a permit for con-
struction of the mall September Iii,
1981. On December 16. the
Guilderland Zoning Board voted to
issue a special use permit to allow
construction of the mail.

The mall‘s developers, Pyramid
('rossgates. only needs to get state
Department of Transportation ap-
proval for construction to begin.
The mall's developers are confident
of this approval and a spring
ground-breaking. The only hope
for the mall's opponents lie within
the court.

Bus Fares Considered

continued from front page ‘
eliminating’the Wellington line; of-
fering bus service for only those
students housed on the five quads;
offering reduced service or totally
eliminating the bus service.
However, one of the two student
members of this study committee,
Eric Koli. said no serious research
has been done on this subject. and
that the alternatives proposed were
all authorized by Stevens himself.
Further. Koli said, no student in-
put has been gathered by the group.
While the nine-member committee
is compromised of faculty, Plant
Department staff and students. Koli
said a meeting had been held by this
committee during January, without
notifying the students in the group.

“The only way I found out about
(this meeting)," Koli said. “was
when I walked Into Steven's ofﬁce
and saw a copy of the minutes on '
the desk."

The minutes show that the only
persons present at this January 12
meeting were ﬁve members of the
Physical Plant Department person-
nci and one member of the Ofﬁce
of Student Lifc.jCarlccn Caﬂson. '

When asked at the Wednesday
meeting why this interscsslon
meeting was held, Carlson explain-
ed that although the group realized
the entire committee could not be
assembled. those remaining "did
not want to waste meeting time."

Carlson also said those meeting
