rook and roll

They've stopped billing
themselves as “The World's
Greatest Rock'N'Roll Band." but
the Rolling Stones have to be the
world's richest after this fall’s US.
tour. The Stones grossed an
estimated 50 million dollars from 12
Weeks of concerts-most of that
from their share of the more than
two million lS-doilar tickets pur-
chased by their fans.

The group also gets a share of
concession saies--coneert-goers
bought an everage of one Stones'
T—shirt apiece--as well as still more
money from closed-circuit TV and
the Jovan perfume company. which
underwrote concert expenses. Of
course you have to subtract ex-
penses for the shows' elaborate pro-
duetions and the cost of back-up
bands and a crew. but it's a safe bet
the Stones will walk away with
tnany millions by the time the books
are closed.

The Reagan administration has
written a new rule barring teenagers
front receiving confidential help
from the nation‘s 5000 federally
assisted family planning clinics.
Health and Human Services

 

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS. JANUARY 29, 1982

ZEIMG NEWS

secretary Richard Schweiker is pro-
posing that clinics be required to
notify parents of anyone under 18
who seeks birth control devices or
prescription drugs for the treatment

of venereal disease. The regulation -

was written with the belief.
Schwciker says. that teenagers “will
generally benefit from the exercise
of a parent‘s mature judgement."
in making sex and family planning
decisions.

if the rule is approved - after a
required 60 day waiting period for
public comment — it could affect
more than 600.000 teenagers who
seek confidential birth control help
each year. Family planning officials
fear the proposal could drive away
as many as half of those patients —
the number. according to a 1980
survey -— who hadn't told their
parents they visited a family plann-
ing ciinic.Shcri Teppcr. the director
of a Denver Planned Parenthood
chapter. says the rule could be a
bonanza for abortion clinics and
also hamper Reagan budget-cutting
efforts. by increasing the welfare
roles through unwanted pregnan-
cies.

dead fish

The Reagan administration is
reportedly preparing to resume
dttmping low-level radioactive
waste in off-shore waters along the
Paciﬁc and Atlantic coasts.The
move would end an 11-year
moratorium imposed after en-
virontnentalists expressed concern
0-.er contamination of marine life.
The Environmental Protection
Agency is now developing new
dumping criteria. however. that
could go into effect as soon as I985.

The government can point to a
I980 investigation that concluded
radiation leaking from a dump site
just outside San Francisco Bay did
not scent to affect marine life.
Nevertheless. some California
legislators are pushing for a con-
tinued ban on nuclear ocean dump-
ing. They are particularly concern-

ed over the navy’s plans to dump
reactors from decommissioned sub-
marines into the see off Cape Men-
docino.

slum city

A new Brookings institute study
claims slums are necessary to urban
America. because they provide poor
people with a place to live. Anthony
Downs. author of the study. says
middle and ttpper income people
want to distance themselves from
the poor. and so create zoning that
forces the poor into the oldest. most
deteriorated areas.

The situation will change. he
says. only if poverty is ended or the
rich provide enough subsidies to
enable the poor to live in decent
ltousing--neither of which is likely
to happen soon.

i love nukes

Many Americans may bc'
pessimistic about surviving a
nuclear war. but not the federal
government. in a series of commen-
taries prepared for publication in
local newspapers, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency is
pushing the idea that the us. could
fully recover from an all-out
nuclear war within two to ﬁve
years. William Chipman, head of
the agency's civil defense division.
says. “people would be miserable.
but they would in all probability
rise to the occasion and restore
some kind of a country."

One F.E.M.A. column — titled,
“Would Survivors of Nuclear At-
tack Envy the Dead? —— Experts Say
‘No." —— has handy hints for turn-
ing a rec-room into a fallout shelter.
The "pre-planned basement snack
bar/shelter." according to the
government. can function as an
entertainment room before. and
presumably. after an attack.
