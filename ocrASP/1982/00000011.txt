Women Cagers Lose to RP] in Overtime. 54-51

By tom COHEN

 

After practicing for two weeks
without playing a game, Albany's
women’s varsity basketball team
was thoroughly prepared. even anx-
ious, for Wednesday night’s game
against 4-7 RPl. After playing to a
48-48 tie in regulation time against
their towering opponents. the
Danes turned the ball over one too
many times and lost the cliflhanger,
54-51.

The first five minutes of the game
swung back and forth. Albany's
Nancy Wurrderlich. the Danes' high
scorer with l6 points and most con-
sistent rcbounder. won the jump,
subsequently received the ball
underneath, and layed it in for the
game's first bucket. With 16:48 re-
maining in the half RPI pulled
ahead 6-5 ant: then 8-7.

After four scoreless minutes
Rl’l‘s Colleen Greaney. the game's
lrigh seorcer. with 24 points. put the
Engineers ahead l0-7. Greancy,
who hurt the Danes last time the
two teams met, scored only eight of
her points in the opening half. Nan-
cy l-lalloran did an outstanding job
defending her.

Both learns played aggressive
defense and worked hard for what
few points they could manage. With
5:4l left in the half the Engineers
led 21-l4. but the Danes reeled ol'l'
five unanswered points pulling
within a basket. A fool and two
quick buck dooor plays to Wanda
Geranian(l4 points) gave Rl’l a
Zo-Zl lead at halftime.

The second hall‘ provided rrruclr
of the satire. ’l’lre Danes. riding the
strong rebounding garrres of jRobin
(iilrson and Wundcr'liclr mungacd
two, tltrec even l'our frustrating al-
ternpts at buckets—none falling.

“We simply did not Ct)ll\‘L‘l'l.

beautiful passes underneath but we
could not make the basket.“ said
Albany assistant coach Mari
Warner.

Albany appeared to fair best
when driving and drawing the tool.

however,put a damper on their
chances.

After getting us close as 30-29 on
Wunderlich‘s two free throws with
1514‘) on the clock, the Danes began
to rush arid force their offense,
resulting in costly turnovers. 'l‘ltc
Engineers stretched their lead to
42-33 after ll minutes had elapsed.

Until then Albany's defense had
been listless. allowiing the easy
basket inside consistently. Playing a
2-3 trap defense the Danes appeared
unable to handle RPl’s short, quick
passes. arid cotrld nOI drop into
their 2-l-2 l‘asl cnotrgh to prevent
the basket at the low post. After
moving into a man-roman. Head
Coach Amy Kidder and Warner
revised the defense into a regular
2-l-2. Their tough. aggressive style
returned.

“We were not recovering enough
after we lost the ball. They were first
breaking and we were not picking
the players up." Warttcr cot-r»
rrrerrted.

l'llirrgs begun happening for the
Danes. Led by Veronica l’trttcrson's
10 sccortd lritll‘ rebounds, plus that
of (iilrson and thlltlctlicll. the
litiginccr's Icad slowly tlitrrinislrcd.

Senior Laurie llriggs' hot

their first. and only lead of the
game—47-46 with 2:20 left.

Even though they continued to
shine defensively, ath the other end
of the court their hot spell had cool-
ed off; easy lrrynps were missed.

With lzlii on the clock the

Engineers snuck in a basket to lead
48-47. Seconds later Briggs had a
chance to win it at the line, but she
could only lie the score. sending the
game into overtime.

The five minute ovetime was a

defensive battle. With a minute and
a half remaining RPl led by 50—48.
Again Albany's laekadaisical foul
shooting allowed them a single
point.

The end came when within the
last 40 seconds of the game Albany

turned the ball over three tithes:

“Turnovers are even more crucial

in overtime. You want to utilize the.

30 second clock; work for a good
shot. The pressure of the game got

to us." Warner said.
