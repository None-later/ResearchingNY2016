ALBANY STUDENT PRESS SDOI'IS JANUARY 29, 1982

National Champions Invade

continued from back page

“It's an important game for the
divisional championship.“ said
Potsdam head coach Jerry Welsh,

The Bears are led this season by

6-3 foward Maurice Woods.

Woods has become the big ol'fcn-
sivc gun since the graduation of
Rowland. According to Saucrs.
Potsdam will be trying to get the
ball to him as they did to Rowland
last year.

Replacing Rowland this season at
center is 6-7 transfer Gary Sparks.
Sparks is a good pcritncler shooter
and blocks a lot of shots. “He‘s
capable of doing a lot of things,"
said Sauers.

Leroy Withcrspoon plays a wing
forward. Last year as a freshman he
made some key shots that helped
the Bears win the national chant-
pionship. including one with four

seconds left in regulation against‘

Albany that sent the (Regional)
game into overtime which Potsdam
cvcntualy won.

certain. Alternating at poirtt guard
will he sophomore Marty (irogin-
ski, .lachirn's trndcrstrrdy last year.
and .Ieri Morablto a 5-10 junior.
The fifth starter will most probably
be Nick Boltini a 6-3 junior from
Rome. New York.

With a decided height advantage
irt favor of tltc llcars. tltc play of
Albany's big men will be that much
more crucial. "()ur post men are
going to have all they cart handle."
said Sttttcrs.

lint witcncvcr Potsdam and

Albany do battle. there is always.
that something extra. The last time
these two teams met at University
Gym. an emotionally drained
capacity crowd \\'ilncssctl a thrilling
triplc ovcrlilnc contest that was won
by the llcars 71-70.

“We've had sonic great great
grtmcs the last few years." said
Welsh. “It's been a grcal rivalry —
always a ftrll houst‘ and great inten-
sity."

game should continue that tradi-

Hamilton Ends Albany Streak

in the second half the game blcw
wide open. Albany cotrld not

unyielding zone defense and the ice
cold Danes could not hit the outside
shots they took. John Dicckclman
was their top scorer with to points.
sinking seven of 20 shots. bill the
usually acctrrate Dan Cronticr hit
only four of ii. Mike Gallo was
three for ll. Jan anoorian only
two for eight and Joe .lcdnak btrt
one for eight.

in the first ten minrrtcs ofthc half
Albany could only muster six
points. lint while they slumped.
ltamilton was inst getting warmed
up. stretching their advantage to .
50-34 over that period.

The Continentnls held on to that
it point margin for five more
minutes and then ran tip the scorc
when Albany srrhstitntcd heavily
and started fouling them.

The defeat was only the Danes‘
sccond in nine games. httt it was
also their second in a row. Last
Saturday they were nipped by (for-
tlttrrd in at SUNY Conference garnc.
7l-67. The two teams are now tied
for second place in thc SUNYAC.
behind Potsdam. with CH records.

Before the losses Albany had won
seven straight. six of them at ltomc.
They avenged an earlier loss to Rl’l
in the Capital District Tournament
with a 58-50 overtime win in
University Gym. Next up was the
Albany invitational Christmas
Tournament for the benefit of
charity. The Danes copped their
own tournament. defeating Stony
lirook and Buffalo.

They then destroyed llrockport.
7346. and toppcd Union for the sc-
cond time this season, 03-6I. They

continued to pick up momentum as .

they pulled off a 54-5! win over
Division ll llartwicl. —— a feat they
had not accomplished in nine years.
The Danes then travelled to
Onconta and for the second straight
Year they overcame the "jinx" that
had plagued them for ten con-
secutive years. They won 58-48.

Potsdam

 

Now. after two losses. the Danes
feel they arc ready to begin a new
win streak. lint to do so they will
have to beat SUNYAC arch-rival
Potsdam tortrorrow night in Univer-
sity (lynr at 8:30.

“We have to really bounce back
now," said Sancrs. "We have to
show what we're made of."

Tar Heels are Tops .' ‘

Like any great drama. the 1981-82 college basketball season is slow-
ly leading up to its climactic conclusion in March. As the season has
progressed into the new year, we have seen some new characters take
leading roles. while perennial frontrunners have taken a back seat to
the new kids on the block. One notcablc exception to this has been
Dean Smith‘s North Carolina Tar Heels, who have played a variety of
tough opposition throughout the season. and yet still have a IS-l
record.

As good a season as the undefeated Missouri Tigers have enjoyed
thus far. it is ridiculous to put any team other than the Heels as
number one. In additon to their seven ACC games thus far, Carolina
has played non-conference teams such as NIT champ Tulsa. Pac-lO
leader USC. SEC power Kentucky. and other line teams such as Kan-
sas. Rutgers. South Florida and Santa Clara. In all. Carolina's non-
lcaguc opponents. all of whom are well over .500. sport a record of
100-43. not counting the games they lost to thc Heels. One loss.
especially to a fine team like Wake Forest, should not jar Carolina
from the top spot. The fact that it did shows how inaccurate the polls
trctuttlly ttrc.

While North Carolina has lived up to their ore-season press clipp-
ings. the Louisville Cardinals have not. Picked by many as the leading
challenger to Carolina for tire number one ranking. the Cardinals have
fallen upon hard times. losing three straight games to drop to an lt-o
record. The Metro Conference race. usually less competitive than a
Russian election. is now rt five-horse race with Louisville having an
outside post position. since they have played only one road game. and
have ttlrcady lost to Virginia Tech twice. The reason for their
breakdown? The Cardinals. for all of their fast-breaking. slant-
dunking talent. donot have a good outside shooting team, and in Divi-
sion l basketball. with tile great zone defenses played by very large
people. you have to have a pure shooter or two, and Louisville does
not.

Recruiting is certainly a major part of college coaching. It can put a
program on the map. and it can also wipc one off the map. At the
beginning of this season. the Georgia Bulldogs were picked to be

among the nation‘s best teams, and one wise guy(mc) actually picked
them to win the whole thing. Why? Because Hugh Durham had done
an outstanding job of bringing in outstanding players. the best of
wltom is 6-7 forward Dominique Williams.Without a true center a year
ago. the Dogs finished t9-l2. narrowly missing an NCAA bid. Once
again. however. Durham failed to bring in a quality center to go with
power forward Terry Fair. and this season. Georgia is paying for it.
Where SEC schools went out and improved themselves. Georgia has
the same team as last year. and teams have discovered how to exploit
their vulnerable middle. Wltilc Durham has done an outstanding job
of bringing irt guards and forwards. his failure to lure a center to
Athens has put Georgia in the dog house.

For the past few seasons, Big it) fans have been trailing their con-
l'crcncc as the nation's best. This season. ltowcvcr. the stroy is a bit
different. as teams like Michigan. Wisconsin and Michigan State have
fallen on hard times. Purdue is 4-2 in thc llig I0. 3-6 outside of it.
Percnnial doormat Northwestern. while still near the bottom. has won
two games in the league, and has lost only one league game by more
than five points. Wltilc town and Minnesota are as good as anyone.
the other eight have slipped to the point that the Dig It) can not be con-
sidered as one of thc nation‘s two or three best conferences. That
honor belongs to the SliC. ACC. and llig East.
