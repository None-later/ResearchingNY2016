Danes Looking to Rebound Against Potsdam

th’l Champion
Bears Invade

Tomorrow Nite -.

 

 

By MARC HASPEL

 

In their first meeting sinee'last year’s
dramatic overtime NCAA East Regional ti-
tlc game. the defending Nationult chatti-
pion Potsdam Bears visit Universtiy Gym
tomorrow night at 8:30 to take on the
Albany State Great Dartes in a critical eon-

fcrence game.

Wltilc this year‘s edition of titre of Divi-
sion lll's most ltotly corttested rivalries
lacks the ntttional significance it has had irr
recent campaigns. the Bears are ctrrrctrlly itr
first place with a slim otrc gattrc lead over
and Cortland.
SUNYAC sttpremacy is ccrtaitrly at stake.

second place Albany

“As far as I'm concerned." sttid Albatty
State head coach Dick Satrcrs. “whoever
wirts the gartre is irt tltc driver‘s sent lit the

conference. "

Becatrse ol' tltat. tomorrow night's gatrre
takes on evert greater importance than tltose
I memorable rcgtrlar seasotr confrontations
of the past. The Bears. 4-0 in the conference
attd 12—5 overall. Iravc otrly lost one regttlar
season divisional gatrre itr the last two years.
But a Dane victory tomorrow would force tt
three way tie between I’otsdam. Albany.
and Cortland. Albany atrd Cortland, at 3- l .
are currently tied for second place in the
division. ()I' cotrrse. whichever learn even-
tttally wins the SUNYAC will receive an
autorrratic bid to the NCAA tournament

this spring.

Perfection — is that the stage the

Although a good portion of the
