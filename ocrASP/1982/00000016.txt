inevitably...

Even though military recruiters
met their goals this year for the first
time since 1973, analysts are saying
a return to the draft is all but in-
evitable. Martin Binkin. an analyst
at the Brookings Institution. says
he'd‘advise teenagers to prepare for
military service, especially if they’re
capable of manning sophisticated
weapons systems—jobs most 1981‘
recruits simply can't handle.

The draft even continues to draw
some} support in Congress. where
critic's like Representative Robin
Beard say the volunteer army is an
"Armed Jobs Corps." for the
unemployed. one that's forced to
rely on extravagant bonuses to keep
experienced soliders. “Checkbook
patriotism won't solve our pro-
blems." lleard says. "even is we
make the assumption that we could
afford it."

at tu haig?

Secretary of State Alexander
Haig has been ordered to speak on-
ly Latin for the next six months.
Fortunately for him. the order
comes rtot from the White House,
but the Unicorn Hunters of Lake
Superior State College.

The group. which annually issues
a list of words that shottld he
banished. this year selected “first
time ever." “revenue
enhancement." and just about
everything uttered by the Secretary
of State. “llaig's misuse of the
language is cltronic and perhaps ir~
reversible." says Peter Thomas, the
society's settior herald. “Even a
simple ‘getting old' becomes
maturation in Haig language.“

supply-side

Connecticut's Senator
Christopher I)odd calls it “supply-
side foreign policy." but no matter
how you add it tip. this is going to
he a record«hreaking year for US.
arms sales abroad.

The latest figures irtdicatc this
year's total will be over $23 billion.
a threefold increase over last year,
and fully 50 percent higher than the
previous record year of 1975.

Then. the prituary [1.8. customer
was the Shah of Iran. Non. it's
Saudi Arabia. which has purchased
more than $40 billion worth of U.S.
arms in recent years.

The huge spurt in military sales
has prompted Senator Dodd. a
Democrat, to accuse the Reagan
t‘\dministratiou of operating a “dis-
count housc for arms." White
House spokesmen say only they are
looking for “Greater Flevihility.”

 

the administration‘s arms sales
policy has come under attack from
another quarter: the prestigious
council on foreign relations. wltich
has issued a JStl-pagc book. "The
(ilohal Politics of Artus Sales."
’1 he author. former State Depart-
tncrtt official Andrew l’ierrc. sitth-
ed ottt for criticism the decision to
sell advanced 17-16 fighter planes to
Pakistan and ‘Vcnemela. Those
sales. he says. will make it virtually
impossible to convince‘ncighbonng
countries to buy less advanced
planes. *' v ~

...useless

The commander} of American
forces in Europe says draft registra-
tion will be useless if war breaks out
in Europe. In secret testimony just
released by the Senate Armed Ser-
vices Committce. NATO General
Bernard Rogers says even if the
US. began drafting soldiers at the
outbreak of a European conﬂict.
the army would run out of trained
soldiers “before the draft can take

over and send the a steady stream of

replacements."

 

Rogers told the lawmakers he’s
embarrassed that the US. criticizes
its allies for not spending enough on
defe‘nse._-w'hllt: not providing
enough trained peacetime soldiers
to defend Europe.

chic pups

Cats seem to be getting most 01‘
the attention lately. but New York
advertising exec Carol Graham
thinks there's a market out there for
the world‘s first doggie drink, a
combination of vitamins, nutrients
and water. designed to put a little
variety in canine diets.

“.ltticec Treat“ smells like hot-
dogs and looks like beef bouillon.
can be served alone—as a before or
after dinner drink——or poured over
dry dog food. After being turned
down by major pet food com-
panies, Graham created her own
firm to distribute the drink. which
she calls "a healthy alternative" to
the less chic doggie beverages.

 

in suds

It may be more complicated than
the conventional method, but an
Italian inventor has patented a dog-
washing machine. Here's how it
works: l-‘ido's head is clamped into
one end of a cylinder lined with
water spray jets. Then. the animal is
scoured with sprays of water and
detergent. followed by a drying
blast of hot air. Then comes the
final cycle—an automatic dog
tnassagc-to calm the excited pup-
py.

missing in action

GI Joe has re-enllsted. The
tlusbro Toy Company says it’s br-
inging back the popular military
doll that disappeared a few years
ago after more than a decade as
America's leading “Male Action
Figure." Once. he's in the stores.
maybe G.1. Joe can pick up some
miniature nylons and Hershey bars
to hand out to the new Brooke
Shields doll. just introduced by a
New York toy company.
