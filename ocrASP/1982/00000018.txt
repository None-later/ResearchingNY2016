WASHINGTON, I).C. (AP) The
Reagan administration is sharply
escalating U.S. military aid for El
Salvador's embattled government
while disputing recent reports that
Salvadoran troops massacred lititi-
dreds of unarmed civilians.

Thomas 0. Enders, assistant
secretary of state for iiiter-
American affairs, outlined the ad-
ministration’s plan Monday and
assured (Tongress that the military-
civilian junta was improving its
human rights record.

Enders said President Reagan
would use emergency powers to
send $55 million in military equipt-
iiieiit to [El Salvador. with about

 

half going to replace aircraft

ed to prevent a victory by Cuban-
backed guerrillas.

“Unless we act decisively now."
he warned. “the future could well
bring more (‘ubas -— tolalilariaii
regimes so linked to the Soviet
Union that they become factors in
the military balance."

liowever, liberal
prepared today to challenge
Reagan‘s Siilvridoiiau policy by
contesting his certification last wee.
that the junta had iiltltlt‘ a strong el-
furt to protect human rights. a rc-
qiiiieuicnt (‘ongress established for

Democrats

contiiiticd aitl.

Reps. (lerry Studds. l)-Mass..
and Tom llarkin. l)-lowa. planned
to submit a resolution to overturn
the president‘s human rights cer-
tification. Such a proposal would
require passage by the House and
Senate - and Reagan's signature.

On Sunday. eyewitnesses in San
Salvador said goveinmcnt troops
murdered more than 20 unarmed
civilians - sortie of them teenagers -
in a sweep tlirotigli a working class
neighborhood. The government
claimed the victims were killed in a
firefight with guerrillas.

That report followed eyewitness
accounts published in The
Ii’rrrlir‘lrgtnn l’m‘l and The New
York Times alleging that govern-
nicttt troops massacred hundreds of
unarmed iticii. women and children
in a rural area during a December
offensive against guerrillas.

Eiidci‘s critisi/ed the government
.roops involved in the Sunday at—
.ack for “excessive violence," but
said U.S. investigators had found
“no evidence . . . that government
forces systematically massacred
civilians" in December.

Referring to Enders‘ admission
of government wrongdoing in the
Sunday attack, Rep. William II.
(iray lll. D-l’a.. said. “That makes
the determination from Reagan on
human rights zilinoat farcical."

Meanwhile. the Peoples Airti-

The Number of Herpes Cases Increased

by M.A. GILLISPIE. MJ). —

Genital herpes infection is not a
new sexually transmitted disease,
but it has increased dramatically in
incidence and is now the second
most common venereal disease in
the United States.

There are two types of herpes

women students into business
courses.
A June I980 Census Bureau

report found "it slow but sure sliitt
of women" away from "traditional
women’s fields," such as educa-
tion. toward business.

Moreover, Snyder added, "we
expect an increase in business
students over the next few years.“

The trouble is that colleges can‘t
recruit enough teachers to ac-
eoniodate those students even if
they could afford to. Not enouin
students are going (in for their doc—
torates or opting for teaching
careers.

"l‘roni our perspective. the most
important task is to attract more
Students irtto l’h.l). programs."
observed Dr. Kenneth Smith, Dean
ol Ari/ona‘s Business School.

Smith said “the difference bel-
wecn academic and business salariet
is iioi as great as most people scerr
to think. For instance. at the better
school'- ii is not unusual fora IWight
l’h.l). to be recruited (by colleges)
a salary that ranges belwecii
$28,000 to 30,000 for a ninc-morilli
position. But students don‘t know
about it. In order to increase supply
of l’h.l).‘s. we need to step up our
l..'t.‘lllllint.'lll efforts."

A new AACSII report said new
business college teachers averaged
starting salaries of $22,800 last
year. though new accounting and
finance teachers are getting 315. 100
aid $24300. respectively.

\\’|iilc escalating recruiting. the
business schools have lcw choices
for immediately ending the crisis.

in Arizona‘s Smith. the choices
are either to restrict the number or
students who can minor in business.
or keep non-business maiors out or
business courses.

Although the AASCli‘s Stone
thinks most colleges want to aioid
restricting business enrollment
because business courses are sortie
of the few profitable ones chI.
Arizona‘s Smith noted iliat “when
people are up against a wall. ilrc
choice is to limit the number of
students in courses because there
just isn't the faculty there to hire."

Other schools including
Smith‘s — have simnlv stiffened
academic standards as a “in 0|
keeping students out.

“This.” Smith warned. "is a bad
movement because only maybe otte-
half the students who wiin to can
get into the business program."

There are also those who. when
falling short of accreditation stati-
dards. would rather change the
standards.

“i think we as business schools
need to question the arrit'icialncss of
some of the standards," said
William Cunningham. Associate
Dean of Texas‘ Business School.

He said sonic schools have tirade

usually causes the common cold

HSV causes disease COIUmn
below the waist. It is

principally genital infection.
iielwccii 20 and 35 percent of Illt.‘
general population has antibodies
in their blood which indicated they
have been infected by HSV Type II
at some point in their lives.

Once a person is infected, symp-
toms usually become apparent in
about a week.

Skin lesions can occur anywhere
on the external genitalia. in the
uretha or in the cervix and vagina.
The skin lesions are vesicles — small
skin "bubbles" filled with clear
fluid — which cause little pain in-
itially. bill which can break down to
form open. raw areas. A flu-like il-
lness often accompanies this if it is
the initial infection.

The severity of the infection
depends to a large extent on lllL‘ cur-
rent immune statiis of the patient.
in general. the painful skin lesions
last one to three weeks before lieal-
ing spontaneously.

cells without causing symptoms.
Recurrent attacks are usually milder
than the primary infection and tend
to be brought on by any sort of
stress -— emotional or physical.

it is usually fairly easy to
diagnose herpes infections by symp-
toms. cultures or blood tests. There
is no effective medical treatment for
herpes; only the symptoms can be
treated.

Aside frotii the pain and irrita-
tion of these infections there can be
other. more serious consequences.
It has been shown that previous
HSV Type II infections are
associated with an increased in-
cidenee of cancer of the cervix.
