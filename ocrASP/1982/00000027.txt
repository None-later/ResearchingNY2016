second place.

"I expect the captains to do very
well in the States. We could take as
many as three events with Uliman
having a very good chance in the
l.M. (individual medley),"

. evaluated the coach.

John Anderson was able to give
the Danes a little breathing room,
recording victories in both the one
meter required dive and free dlvc
events. Frank Parker placed se-
cond.

To finish up a victorious evening,
Kozaknwicz swam to a ﬁrst place in
the 200 yard breaststroke. posting a
lintc oi 2:2i.72.

“Wc swam a very good meal.
We‘re a veteran team and know
what we have to do." added For-
nnndcz.

The coach is primarily concerned
at this point with qualifying her
team members IOr the New York
State Tournament. “Tito squad is
working very hard and is coming
back really strong In this second
\cttson." slated Fernandez.

The win lifted the Danes' record
to 4-3. Tomorrow they will take on
t'urtinnd State. The team is plann-
ing to swim its host and continue its
attempt to qualify people for the
States. The coach would not
forecast victory. but did say that
she expects "a close mccl" against
one of the top teams in the
SUNYAC.

"Everyone is improving as we
build up yardage on the road to our
ultimate goal: winning the States,"
said Fernandez.
