1:52.23. The Dane freshman was
far from through when he dove off
the starting blocks in the 100 yard
freestyle. Handy recorded a per-
sonal low and another victory in a
‘52.03 time.

“Tom is steadily improving. He
is young, strong and never runs out
or energy.” praised swimming
coach Dulce Fernandez.

Handy's bountiful energy was
seen as he came back just two
events later to take the 500 yard
freestyle. His time of 5:l0.90 was
simply "outstanding" according to
his coach.

Before Handy was able to record
one victory, the Danes were already
on track. Freshman Jeff Ball and
co-captain Steve Bonawitz hit the
wall one and two. respectively. in
the i000 yard freestyle. Ball trium-
phed rather easily. ﬁnishing over 16
seconds ahead of the ﬁeld.
Bonawitz and the other co-
captain. Neal Ullman. competed
against each other in the 200 yard
backstroke. They also ﬁnished back
to back with Bonawitz finishing
first in a time of 2:07.92.

Ullman did not go winlcss on the
night when he recorded a victory in
his specially. the 200 yard in-
dividual medley. His time was
2:08.67 and was followed barely
'two seconds later by another Dane.

I Mike Gerstman. a forward for
uptown's League ll Wizards. led
his team in two victories and a
near upset this past week in in-
tramural basketball. Averaging
25 points in the three-game span.
"Crusher" set off the Wizards’
fast break attack with solid
defense and consistent reboun-
ding.

in his squad's contest with
Southern Comfort. Gerstman
hit a 15-foot jump shot with two
seconds remaining in regulation
play to tie the game and send it
into overtime.

With two more victories this
past week. Vic Herman has i
brought his Albany record of
most career dual meet wins to a
total of 47. Last Saturday, Hcr-
man. the wrestling team captain.
registered a pin over his Univer-
sity of Massachusetts opponent.
giving the Danes an exciting
22-21 win. His awesome skill and
years of experience have made
the 2l5-pound junior "one of
the best heavyweights in the.
country.” according to wrestling
coach Joe DcMeo.

With the conference‘schedulcs roughly at the = _ y ' .
easy to see why college basketball is one of America's most popular
spectator sports. The balance of the various teams is such that itreaily
makes the games unpredictable. You never know what is going to hap-
pen. or when. ~

Who would have thought that on January 27, Mississippi State. a
team that was 0-8 in the SEC and 4-12 overall. would rise up and shock
Kentucky, generally considered to be among the nation's Top Ten. Al
McGuire says that there is no such thing as an upset on the road. but
this game would have to be called an upset. since the Bulldogs had lost
their previous game by the score of 54-30. Certainly, the Miss. St.
players must have surprised even themselves. -

 

The Missouri Valley Conference entered into national prominence I ‘
when Larry Bird led indiana St. into the Final Four, lhree years ago. '
Since Bird's graduation. however, the Sycamores have fallen upon
hard times. with things getting so bad this year that coach Bill Hodges
resigned. On January 23. thongh. Indiana St. pulled off a major upset a.
when they knocked off then league leader Tulsa, 6069. The Hur-
ricanes had just ﬁnished beating Wichita St. and Southern Illinois,
two teams superior to the Sycamores. and no analyst in his right mind
could have forecast this occurrence. Such is the shape of college [
basketball. ~ . y

We said this week that North Carolina should still be considered as l
the nation's best team. but that idea was shot down when Virginia ‘
bombed the Heels. 74-58. on Wednesday night. Missouri truly
deserves the title of number one at this point, but if the Tigers hope to
win a national title, and this may sound strange. they had better lose a ‘
game or two. Norm Stewart's team already has an NCAA berth locked
up. and the pressure of being unbeaten is so great that it takes a week .
or so for the team to bounce back from that ﬁrst defeat. if that defeat
comes too late. or not at all. that pressure. combined with NCAA
tournament pressure. would be too great for Missouri. Look for the
Tigers to drop at least half of a two-game swing next weekend that
takes them to Kansas and Oklahoma St.
