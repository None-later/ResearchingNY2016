SWYA CRace Tightens

By LARRY KAHN

BINGHAMTON, N.Y. — In the
aftermath of every Albany-
Potsdam, SUNY-Conference clash
' there is almost always a let down by
both teams. After last Saturday's
contest. which Albany won 72-62,
this pattern held true.

For the Danes little damage was
done: they survived a late comeback
attempt by Binghamton on
Wednesday night. thwarting them
59-43. '

Potsdam. however, was not so
lucky. For the Bears. the letdown
proved to be lethal; Onconta nip-
ped tlrem in a triple-overtime
thriller. 6I-60. ‘

This series of events creates a
tiglttening in the SUNYAC East
Division race, with Albany now in
sole possession of first place with a
5-] conference record. Cortland
follows at 4-1. Potsdam is 4-2. and
Oneonta is a iongshot at 3-3. The
two top teams qualify for the
SUNYAC Championship tourna-

' ment against the West Division win-

ncrs.

Despite the lopsided ﬁnal score
on Wednesday. Binghamton was by
no means an easy nrark for the
lackluster Danes. The Colonials.
perennial cellar-dwellers in the

East. seem to always give Albany a
hard time. but they also always
lose.’

“i knew they would be tough."
said Albany basketball coach Dick
Sauers of Binghamton, now 2-12.
“Especially after we played
Potsdam — we usually have a let
down."

The Danes had many chances to
put the game out of reach. but each
time they suffered a lapse in con-
centration. and the Colonials kept it
close. With 6:56 left in the opening

rhalf. Albany led by nine. 21-12. But

suddenly Binghamton began driv-
ing right through the Albany
defense and closed the gap to 24-20
at the half.

"i thought we were very careless
in the ﬁrst half; it was a careless.
uninspired first half." said Sauers.

At the start of the second half.
the Danes appeared determined to
put the "game out of reach.
Freshman guards Jan Zadoorian
and Dan Croutier combined for
seven unanswered points in the ﬁrst
seven mintrtcs to put Albany up by
ll. But again there was the lapse in
concentration. and Binghamton
creepcd back.

With l0 minutes left in the game.
the Colonials started to press the
Danes. Bill Petcrrnan forced a steal

and took the ball in for an easy lay
up to close the gap to six. 37-31.
Sauers called time out to set up
against the press and to take away
some of the Colonials‘ building
momentum.

Only .iohn Dieckelman's hot
hand held off the inspired
Binghamton attack. Dieckelman
tossed in l2 straight points for
Albany over an eight minute stretch
while the Colonials continued to ctrt
the ' lead to four with 2:29 left.
47-43.

That was as close as they came.
Mike .Gatto added two for the
Danes with a lay up. and Dave
Adrrrn. Croutier, Joe .iednak and
Dieckelman each followed with two
free throws. all without a Bingham-
ton scorc. Joint Frci capped off the
scoring with a pair of free throws in
fotrr attempts.

"They got tough when they need-
ed to get tough.” said Sauers about
his players. “Dieckelman asserted
himself when we needed hint."

The Danes travel to Utica tomor-
row where they’li battle Division l
Uticn College, coached by former
NBA couch Larry Costello. After
that. they’ll be home for three con-
secutive conference games.

Grapplers Power Past Western New England

By MARK GESNER

“When you really have
something to show —-— people want
to see it. We have that something to
show." explained Albany wrestling
coach Joe DcMeo.

What the people came to see this
past Wednesday night was a class
act. On display was a group of
dedicated 'Aibany athletes doing
what they do best — winning.

in a 29-l0 rout over Western New
England College. the grapplers up-
ped their school record for the most

dual meet wins in a single season to'

15. The team's record of lS-Z-l also
gives them the highest winning

 

percentage in Albany's 30-year
wrestling history.

in a nutshell. the victory two
nights ago was a work of art. The
Great Danes leaped out to a 12-0
lead and never ttrrned back. it was
the first time that Albany had ever

.bcatcn their 16-6, nationally ranked

opponent.

“Obviothly the guys we depend
on to win did win." commented
DcMeo. Among those wrestlers that
the coach counts on are seniors
Warren Wray and Dave Stratrb.

Wray. plagued with various il-
lnesses throughout the past month.
came out on top in an exciting 5-4
decision. Ecstatic with his victory

 

 

 

The grapplers added to their dual meet record with their first win eye! over

Western New England. (Photo: More iienschel)

and his good health. Wray reflected
that “it‘s the first time that l ltave
felt up since vacation."

Stratrb registered what was a
seemingly easy win. scoring an 8-1
decision over his l67-pound oppo-
ncnt. Moreover, he played a pivotal
role for the team. “His mutcir was
really the turning point for us."
concluded DcMeo.

The coach's list of dependables
continues with more consistent and
hardworking wrestlers. A pin by
Spcro Thcofiirrtos. and winning
decisions by Ed Gleason. Dan
Jeran. and Dave Averill have all
become part of the routine for the
Dane grapplcrs.

“We are getting to the point that
I go otrt on the unit expecting to
win." said the llii-pound Averill.
The only starting freshman on the
team. Averill has tunasscd a l4-l
record, and his optimistic feeling is
shared by the entire squad.

“We have the winning attitude.
Tire team has shown a i()() percent
improvement over the beginning of
the year." noted Andy Scrus.
Meanwhile. Scras. a sophomore. re-
mains out of the line up with a
dislocated clavicle. Even though the
All-American has been severely
missed, the fact that thc grupplcrs
have accomplished so rrntclr without
him is just another credit to the
organization.

Another new phenomenon that
the Will-82 wrestling tcam cx-
perienced in their last competition
was fun support. in the past it was
only those very few loyal admirers
who would appear at a match.
However. an Wednesday it crowd

of well over lilo spectators showed .

up in the University Gym.

“it just gave us a cirancc to Show
everyone at home that we are an ex-
citing team to watch." noted Wray.

“it's really hard wrestling for
seven minutes." added Theofilatos.
“The crowd helps a lot when you‘re
otrt tltcrc (on the mat). They might
have been the reason wiry we did so

well."

Taking their act on the road. the
grapplcrs will complete their rcgtrlur
season with it tri-mcet with the
Coast Guard Academy. The Dancs’
opponents will be Coast Guard.
Ri’i. and Central Connecticut.

is a good idea because it would “br-

Low-income homeowners and

to pay their home heating costs may
be eligible for a $l40 to Slot) grartt
through 'thc Home Energy

A federally-funded program.

This program is designed to pro-
vide assistance through credits or.

in some cases. by direct grants. even
to those wltosc energy and heating
costs are already included in their
rent.

in order to facilitate the applica-
tiort process. the Home Heating
