Vice President Woody Popper Resigns

By JUDIE EISENBERG

 

SA Vice President Woody
Popper Wednesday night an-
nOunced his resignation from
office.

As he is not a registered stu-
dent this semester, POppcr felt
he could no longer hold any
elected pOSiiion in the Student
Association.

Popper will continue to fill
his official duties in the capacity
of acting vice president until a
replacement is elected in two

Council' members at Wednes-
day’s meeting. approxiamately
seven hours after he learned of
his present non-student status.

Associate Dean f0r
Undergraduate Studies Dr.
Stanley Schwartz stressed that
Popper’s present non-student
status is not a case oflacademie
dismissal. Rather, as Pepper
said, this was “a withdrawal of
sorts.”

However. Popper would not
discuss the details of his case.

Po|0ge is presently consider-

allow Popper to retain sortie of

Pologe said. “But we con-

Pologe has offered to give up

“awkward about SA paying me

But after Whitehead missed a

Albany struggled to keep pace
with the Pioneers as Utiea had

sider extending the closing date.
Wharton could not be reached
for comment.

As a result of the
Chancellor's latest decision. UB
