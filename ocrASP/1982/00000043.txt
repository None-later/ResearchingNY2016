hen Plato sought to define the
- object of art, be frequently us-
ed the image of live birds trying
to pluck painted grapes from a canvas.
In other words. sophisticated. beautiful
art imitated reality. And some centuries

later John Keats decided “beauty is
truth. truth beauty." these two
gentleman have created an open con-
troversy for man — and visiting
photographer Joe Gantz sought to ex-
plore this dilemna in his work shown
Tuesday to a small crowd of anxious
observers.

Deborah Millman

The most definitive statement of Mr.
Gantz's Work was cited by Gantz
himself: “Confusion. Pain. Anger. Fear
and Hysteria.” Gantz presented over fif-
ty slides of various periods of his work.
but his original statement pervaded
them all. Most pictures consisted of nak-
ed women and men In varied positions
— from the traditonal "femai- spread
eagle. gynecological style." to rear
views of women touching their toes.
and men bowing down to a women's
feet while shrieking All showed art anti-
glamorous image uncommon for
Women. This consisted of a sad. sarl
castic view of women and men relating
and to the hidden reality beyortd the
surface of body language and human
behavior.

in his first series of pictures. Gantz
worked with images in black and white
— a dark. brooding consistency which
emphasized man's inherent a\\enation
and isolation while at the same moment
mocked it. in the shot “Christ With An
Erection." -Gantz puts down the
church's definition of the roles of men
and women and the frustration this pro.

ting on a tux and God is a blue-colar
worker carving the backside of a Women
face down on his lap. All this occurs in
what looks like a factory. He compared
his technique to photographing inside a
tornado. .

ln Gantz's second series of photo‘s.
he ironically portrays couples' relation-

ships.

Ciantz introduced his third series of
phot‘o's with "Twit Whores" — four
naked Women in line—up pose — two

bosomy and beautiful: two skinny and

    

pailretic. He left it up to the audience to
decide which were the whores. An in-
tereting paradox. Here. the interiors
take on as much importance as the sub-
jects. Rooms are of a man-made con-
struction and have a cool. corporate
feeling. Often the photo's are pictoral
improvisations of which Gantz is often
in. (A timer provided this freedom).
Besides his photography books. (one
published and one in the Works) Gantz
is also the author of tWo non-fiction
books; The Children of Gay Purgnls

Menage A Quatre

he experience of seeing

Quartet is similar to that of be-

ing the only sane person urt-
justly locked up in a mental institution
you’re constantly looking for someour
or something that has a shred of sense.
However. until the usher comes to let us
out, our search is hopeless.

This is not just a bad movie. it crosses
over the line into absolute wret-
chedness. Alan Bates. Maggie Smith
and lsabelle Adiani are all imrnertsely
gifted performers. but here they are
downright embarrassing. Bates
especially is so broad and melodramatic
that he becomes absurd.

They are not helped by Ruth PraWer
Jhabvala's screenplay, adapted from
Jean, Rhys' novel. The characters corti-
plelely lack any kind of motivation. We
are given no explanation of their past or
futures and their actions iii the presmrt
are none too clear either. Why for ex-
ample do Smith and Adjani take part it]
the triangular garne Bates insists on
playing? He hardly appears to be the
kind of man who is so devastating that
Women can' i live without him. We are

why or front where. And who are the
almost identical looking men who keep

everywhere she goes?

i cart see in Quartet the possibilities of
art exploration of the games of physical
and mental possession that are part of
certain intense love relationships. The
film makers chose to

The characters exist on neither a

literal level. they are merely
moutlipeices for Jhabvala's pathetic
dialoge (a few samples. “l'm so in love
with you i wish i were dead." and the
following exchange about Bates
“What's biting him?" “He's Just some
loudmoutlt'Errgllslnnan who thinks he's
Queen Victoria")

Normally. in journalistic endeavours
of this sort. this is the point where a brief
plot synopsis is given. i would like to
oblige. but I'm afraid I didn't quite follow
exactly what the plot of Quartet was.
However. ['11 be glad to tell you what i
know.

Adiani's husband gets sent-to jail (i
think for stealing) and Bates and Smith.
they're married. take her in (I think
because he want to have sex with her).
She starts to have an affair with Bates
and then her husband gets (Tut of jail.
Sometimes she loves Bates. sometimes
she hates him. the same goes for her
husband (Anthony Higgins) who is. l
fourth member of the
quarter. in the end she goes off with
some guy her husband met in jail who
isn't introduced until the last 15
minutes. While all this is goirtg on Smith
speaks in empty Conwilutions that I
think are supposed to be witty.

With the exception of Judy Moon-
craft's beautiful 1020's style costumes.

Quartet is nothing but a pointless and

This was one of the sun

leader of the XAistentials. a local rock
band trying to build a following against
increasing odds. Bar owner attitudes
have changed. and they are now book-
ing commercial “cow-r" bands instead
of original artists.

Bogart's is one of the few venues for
such bands. and it features local acts
every Sunday night. The latest show
was art inspired performance by the
X—istentials. who satisfied a crowd of
about 75 with their British-influenced
rock repertoire.

The X-istentials displayed a profes-
sional sound emanating frortt the power
trio of guitarist/songwriter Whiting.
bassist Bob Gori arid drummer Chris
Sullivan. with Dave (Elastetter handling
the vocals.

The band has released their first 45.
“Darkest Part of Me." a catchy mid~
tempo rocker with pop guitar rhythms.
“It's about violence and existence. the
evil part of people." explained Whiting.
“They snap and do sorttetlriitg violent

been more convincing.

The X—istentlals showed a flair for in-
terpreting little—knwon songs. adding
new energy to an old reggae tune by
The Slippers. “Johnny Too Bad." and a
rave-up of The Ventures' instrumental.
“Pipeline.” which ended the show on a
high note.

The band has been playing area bars
for over a year. averaging three gigs a
month. Whiting said they've had trouble
finding places to play. but “we've
received generally good responses from
audiences."

A recently recorded video and work
on a new EP with the ADS. The
Weekenders and The Crude will
hopefully boost The X-isterrtials'
popularity. according to Whiting.

Whiting aims for a diversified sound
for the future ~ "l'd like to try anything
as long as it makes the music sound bet-

er." He Would also like to add a
keyboard player and “experiment with
nwv sounds."

The X—istentials are hopeful that their
music will catch on and they cart some-
day play New York. Right now they are
