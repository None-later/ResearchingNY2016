tillﬂlli, Somme

(February 5). He criticizes Mr. Flet-
cher, calling him blind, and then
magnanimously forgives him his glar-
ing fault. He accredits Mr. Fletcher's
blindness to hispassionate involvement
with ROTC. Yet. my four years at this
institution have shown me that devo-
tion to a cause may lead to blindness
on either side of an issue.

I am not a part of the ROTC pro-
gram sponsored through RPI. I am a
graduate of the United States Marine
Corps Officer Candidate’s School and
will accept a commission as a second
lieutenant in May. I spent ten weeks in
northern Virginia this past summer,
working my tail off for that commis-
sion. I consider that one of the most
valuable experiences of my life. Of
those in my class. nonc left more stupid
than when he or she arrived. I can also
assure everyone that not one of the
graduates left OCS uncritical about
some aspect of the Marine Corps.
Some of the most biltcr criticism came
from the very candidates who intended
to accept their commissions.

Lerner criticizes West Point, claim-
ing that its cadcts graduate stupid and
uncritical. He would do well to
research its curricular background.
Presently included are: physics;
chemistry; history; military history;
mathematics; English (grammar,

i

,1 literature, and public speaking);
,modern languages; law; ~economics;
igovernment; mechanics; engineering;
'and political science. West Point hap-
pens to be one of the more competitive
and academically demanding institu-
tions. How does Lerner know that
cadets graduate uncritical? Has he
taken a poll among many of its
graduates, or any of its graduates? If
so, I would like to see this data, along
with some official recognition.

Has he had any exposure to the
positive aspects of military life? He has
obviously had exposure to some of the
critical propaganda, which is mostly
clichc and rhetoric, anyway. Experien-
cing the hard work, total immersion in
an alien environment, the friendships
born of both common goals and
necessity, and the sense of achievement
and self pride makes onc’s criticism
more judicious and less rash.

It is obvious that the military is not
for everyone; it is not meant to be. I
fail to sec how Mr. Fletcher‘s par-
licipalion in ROTC, or even the ex-
istence of an ROTC program for those
who desire it, poses a threat to Richard
Lcrncr, or anyone else. Internal
criticism is usually more accurate arld
credible than external criticism. How
about it, Richard?

Tri-Cit y Council Plans
Kai/ah Weekend

Marion R. Weisenfeld

Hch at SUNYA, we tend to consider
ourselves to be one big family: self-
sufficicnt and characteristically self-
ccntcrcd. Actually, this is the way most
schools look at themselves. and for
good reasons. We work hard to gel tllc
most from an education and our
education dollars. But, if all schools
gcncruily view their purpose in this
same way, it sccrns quilc practical and
even beneficial to find out how tlrcy go
about reaching thcsc gouls.

Our SUNYA family is purl of u 'I'I‘i»
City community of ciunpuscs including
Skidnlorc College, chssclucr
Polytechnic lrlslilutc, Union (‘ollcgc.
Schcncclrldy (‘ornrnunity and Hudson
Valley Community (foilcgcs, just to
nzunc u fcu. Lust year this community
of schools dccidcd lo cornbinc cl't'orts
through thcir rcspcctivc .lcwish Stutlcnl
Organizations.

Resulting frorn this effort was lhc
first annual Tri-Cily Krillah Weekend
where the Jewish student families of
four campuses joined togclhcr for a
cultural, religious and social weekend
in Massachusetts. That weekend was
extremely successful in fostering an
awareness of and a genuine interest in
bringing together the Tri-City area
schools for the purposes of sharing
programs, resources and issues of con-
cern to all of the Jewish Student
Organiluiions.

This year, the Jewish Slndcnt groups
of R.P.l.. Skidrnorc. Union and
SUNYA formed a charter organization
called, apprOprintcly, lilc Tr'i-(‘ity
Council of Jewish Slutlcnl ()rguni/u-
lions. Tllc cfforts of this ycur‘ liilVl.‘

: unit:- .' . uﬂ~:?.inﬁf:

created the weekend to bc held
February 26-28 with the theme “The
American Jewish Expcricncc. . .How
Do You Fit in?"

Programming for this weekend in-
cludcs prominent speakers and pro-
fessors addressing such issues as
“Religious Cults,” “.Icwish
Stereotypes." “Arltisclnilisrn,”
“.lcwish Parenting," “Women irl
Judaism" and “Zionism and Israeli
Politics," just to name :1 fcw.

Aside from thc lcnrning cxpcricncc
provided by tllc wcckcnd, tllc Knllzlh
also giycs roughly cigllty collcgc
slutlcnls from tllc 'l’ri-City lll'L‘li un im~
pOI'llliIl opportunity to gulllcr, sllnrc

Thc 'l‘ri—(‘ity Council also cool“
dinatcs other programs (picnics,
spcakcrs, dancc groups, ctc.) bclwccn
schools which arc also fun, rcluxing
lllld serve to create zl fccling of corn-
munity rlmong schools that ucvcr cx-
istcd‘ before.

Why, then, should this "awareness
of community" stop with Jewish Stu-
dent Organizations in thc Tri-City
area? The Tri-City Council is an exam-
ple of the positive results that can be
obtained when one university famin
extends its reach to others in the com-

‘ mulrity. As students at SUNYA, we are

not in this cductional schcmc alone.

Furthermore, once more of us
rcalizc the benefits of interaction with
sludcnls in other educational settings,
whether it be on it Tri-(‘ily or even
slate-wide lcvcl. our cffcctivcncss as
studcnls bcconlcs grcully enhanced. If
you doubt this, just spcrlk with any Tri
City studcnt aftcr thcy‘vc attended the
'I'ri-(‘ity Killlllll ill two \yccks. You‘ll
discover, possibly for the first timc,
that as t‘runiiics lu lhc cducruional corn-
nulnity, Wli ARE ONE.

I Wo rk- Learn . . 1.

Are you in college to study Or to learn? , '

There’s a difference, and it’s one that is very important to your
education.

Some people at Albany State are studying. And that’s all they’re
doing. They read all their assigned readings, write all their assigned
papers, and get fantastic grades. But that’s all they do. They’ll
graduate from SUNYA Summa Cum Laude, and all they’ll have .
learned is how to study.

Some people here are learning. There’s actually quite a few of
.them — you may even be one of them. They’re all over campus —
with concerns as diverse as nukes, children, hunger, rights, higher
education -— and they’ve all learned that there’s more to learning
than grades.

The vice-president of SA is one of these people. By his own ad-
mission, hc spent so much time on his official duties —— helping
students — that be neglected his schoolwork. He‘s resigning as
vice-president now bccnusc he spent a lot of time learning and not
as mrlch timc studying.

In zl rcccnt cdltorirll, The New York Times complained that
students czu'c too much about their grades and not enough about
their education. That’s a gross ovcrsimlification'.

While there seems to bc a trend toward students as bookworms,
there also seems to be u trcrld toward students who care. Students
who give a damn about more than just finding that gut course.

The pcoplc who car ‘ arc the people who learn. The others are

just . . . students.
. . . Hard

The best part abOut this job is the dependability of the ASP
staff. Our typesettcr has been out of commission for over a Week
waiting for a proper repair engineer, and the staff has put in long,
exhausting hours trying to put out this paper.

I can’t even promise the staff when the machine will be finished,
but they keep sticking in.

This issue, our thanks go out to Shaker High School for letting
us use their Trendsetter. Without our friends, we never could have
made it. —D.B.
