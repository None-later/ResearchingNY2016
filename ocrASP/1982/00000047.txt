SUNY Chancellor Clifton R. E
Wharton, JR.‘ explained that ,
the increase in dorm rates is'a '1

’ move toward making thc dor-

mitories “self-sufficient."

“The reality of ‘sclf—
sufficiency' is a removal of state
support for dorm operations,"
chler countered. “They're'go-
ing to drive out students if they
can't afford it."

“The whole idea of a state
university is to have sOmething
accessible to the students,"
Turncy said. “The cost could
well be $2,000 in the next three
years, actually blocking access
to this school for some.”

Tierney explained SASU’s

ing to organize people to lobby
from different schools. For ’ex-
ample, students from Cortland
can lobby both their represen-

“We-want groups of six
students representing each
school to lobby key committees,
including the Ways and Means
Committee and the Senate
Finance Committee, and key
legislators, such as Assembly
Speaker Stanley Fink and Ma-

jority Leader Warren Ander-

Wiener added that lobby
packets, with information such
as an analysis of the budget lob-
bying techniques will be handed
out to the students.

.lim Tierney projected
that,“We can win much of this
back. It all depends on the
students. We can win if people
get down to the rally, write a let-

show their support."

Keane complained to Mar-

on the basis of one incident.
Martone said tltc noise violation
and the room reassignment were
two unrelated incidents, and
promised to reconsider the deci-
sion and then contact him.

However Keane was never
contacted.

Marlone claimed this was a
mix-up and said he has since
apologized to Keane.

The Werewolves also insisted
Quad CbOrdinalOr Liz Radko
never spoke to any of them

also questioned why they were
not referred to a normal
Judicial Board.

While Liz Radko refused to
comment on the Wcrcwolvcs'
cases, both Marlonc and Mur-
plty backed her actions.

Murphy felt it was unrealistic
to require Radko to speak. to
each student before referral,
because of the large number of
students referred on Alumni
Quad.

Murphy also explained that
any_ violation of the housing
license can be brought up in
front of Judicial board or
Residence Review Board. and
that the Student Affairs Office
makes the final decision.

Presently, some of the
Werewolves are appealing their
cases before Dean of Student
Affairs Neil Brown.

Brown could not be reached
