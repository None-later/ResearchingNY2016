The curse of the Albany
Great Danes this season has
been inconsistent shooting. Last
Saturday, Albany hit only 35
percent of their shots when they
lost to Division I Utica by eight
points.

But on Tuesday night the
Danes were back on target.
They downed SUNY Con-
ference foe Plattsburgh, 70-63,
connecting on 46 percent of
their shots. The Cardinals were
not easy marks, however, bang-
ing in 25 of 51 attempts of their
own.

“If Plattsburgh shot that well
all of the time, their record
wouldn't be as bad as it is,”
said Albany basketball coach
Dick Sauers about the 5-14 (0-7
in the conference) Cardinals.

Plattsburgh lcd 32—é9 with
three minutes left in the first
half, overcoming a seven point
Albany edge, but they could not
hold on. Dane guard Dan
Croutier took charge and gave
Albany a 37-35 lead at halftime.
The freshman pumped in six
straight points and made a
perfect pass to Dave Adam,
who made an easy layup, wiping
out Plattsbur h's advanta e.

“lf you don‘t have con-
fidence in yourself, you can
pack it in," explained senior
Eddie Morales. “If l go into a
match confident, I‘m not giving
him (the opponent) any respect.
That way I wrestle my kind of
match instead of his."

However. the etnphasis is on
“confidence, not coekiness,"
stressed All-American Andy
Scras. Indeed, tlte Danes have
no right to be too sure of
themselves; they will face three
schools in the SUNYAC’s with
higher national rankings.
Broekport, ()swego, and Buf-
falo are ranked one, two and
seven, respectively, among the
country‘s 350 Division III
schools, while Albany is ranked
sevcteenth.

“I think that we are a very
good dual meet team - but even
a better tournament team,"
claimed junior Vie Herman.
The squad captain explained
that to do well in a tournament
a team has to have wrestlers
who can place high enough to
score points in the force of
heavy competition. Albany
boasts up to eight wrestlers who
have a solid chance of scoring in
the SUNYAC's.

Herman, who has broken two
Albany school records, will not
receive top seeding in tonight‘s
tourney. Wrestling in the

“He (Jednak) has always

Sauers. “As long as he takes
good shots, he'll make most of
them."

.Social activist Dick Gregory
alerted a captivated audience in
the nearly filled Campus Center
Ballroom Sunday night. to what
he sees as the “endless con-
spiracies of the ‘pimps’ in
government.”

Gregory, a comedian-turned
activist, spoke in a manner
reminiscent of his comedy
routine; but instead of being
funny, his punchlines rang with
alarming social commentary.

Gregory suggested the au-
dience become more perceptive
of “governmental dirty deal-

ings" in national and interna-
tional affairs.

He accused the FBI of being
involved in the assassination at-
tempt to-kill President Reagan.
Gregory called Reagan “a little_

old jelly bean-eating thug,""v'n‘=
spelled?

joking that Reagan
backwards is “nigger.”
Gregory felt Reagan is just a
"puppet" and when he “does
bad, they‘ll throw him down."

Gregory felt the government
is not building nuclear plants
for energy conservation pur-
poses. “The pimps are making
nuclear weapons to kill you,"
Gregory charged, and em-

phasized that once a country
dropped a nuclear bomb, there
would be no chance to retaliate.

“The Moral Majority is a
bunch of old white women,” he
claimed, and that if the group
was really moral, they would
talk about m0ral things, such as
rascism. .

In comparing lieland and
Poland's revolutionaries, he
chided, "if you fight for liber-
ty, and they like you, then you
are called freedom fighters. If
they hate you, you are called
guerrillas. if there was a hunger
strike in Poland, the people who
starved to death would be seen

as heroes, while the Irish hunger
strikers are just called juvenile
delinquents."

At one point in his speech, he
read from FBI memos written in
I968, which said “Gregory is
demented,” and that “he
should be neutralized."

Although his speech was
geared toa racially mixed'au-
dience, Gregory took time to
single out the Black pOpulation.
He criticized them for not
knowing the Black national An-
them, but being able to sing all

Funds Allocated to Rehire Popper

By JUDI E EISENBERG

Central Council's Finance
Committee Sunday night ap-
proved the allocation of $2,500
to pay acting Vice President
Woody Popper to remain work-
ing in the SA office after his
replacement is elected.

Popper announced his
resignation as SA Vice Presi-
dent last week. As he is no
longer a registered student, he
felt he could not hold any
elected position in the Student
Association.

The money, which will be
taken from the SA emergency
spending line, will be dispersed

as weekly salary over the three
and one half months between
the upcoming replacement elec-
tion and the end of the
academic year, aceording to ac-
ting Finance Committee Chair
Scott Kuncn. ‘

The committee approved the
$2,500 salary allocation
because, Kuncn said, “we felt

_ we could not deal withOut (Pop-

pcr)."
Kuncn felt tltc amount of
money allocated was

reasonable, considering what
Popper‘s cost of living will be in
the coming tnonths.

mittee thought he should get

Wharton is Center of Student Protest

_._______._._————-
By LISA MIRABELLA

_,______.___._—

when students gather this
afternoon at SUNY-Central to
protest cuts to education in the
prOpOSCd 1982-83 budget, they
will focus their anger on SUNY
Chancellor Clifton R. Wharton
Jr. and his role in

the budget pro- i‘tii‘wS.

cess. ~
“I’m an easy (Ina'i’s'l'

target for the ral~

ly," Wharton admitted.
Although Wharton said he

doesn’t mind taking respon-

sibility for the decisions he
makes, he insists the tuition and
dorm rent increases have not
been his decisions.

Nevertheless, since Wharton
came to head SUNY in I978
there have been three $150 dorm
rent hikes, as well as two tuition
increases, and he continues to
be a target of students‘ ire; for
example, the question "What
ltas SUNY Chancellor Wharton
done for you?" is seen on the
rally publicity, along with
“Don’t let Wharton price you
out of an education."

Wharton explained the first
dorm rent increase in I979 was
for rcparis which were needed in
dormitories throughout the
SUNY system.

T he idea of
“self-sufficiency“ for dor-
mitories, he said, originated

after a study of how tnuch state
dormitory subsidy other state
schools across the country
received.

The findings of the study, ac-
cording to Wharton, were that
New York State allots substan—
tially more money to finance
dormitories in state schools
than most states.

SUNY students contend the
Chancellor does not consider
their interests in allowing for
the rent increase.

“In many SUNY schools
students must live on campus
because it is a rural university
and there is very limited off—
eampus housing." SASU
Delegate Jim Tierney pointed
out. “The purpose of the state
university," ’l'ierney added, “is
to provide a quality edttcation
at a low cost. l-iigh housing

costs will have a great itnpact in
limiting accessibility to the
university.”

Wharton said the subsidy to
dormitories is unfair in that it is
only directed to students who
live on the campuses. He sug-
gested that if off-campus
students were organized they
might be against all the sub-
sidies going to dormatories.

Wharton did not address the
rent increases that, according to
SASU officials, many landlords
impose when dorm rent is in-
creased.

Students also question a
possible conﬂict of interests
posed by Wharton’s holding
positions on several corporate
boards while heading a public
school system.

Wharton is a member of the
board of directors of Ford
Motor Company, Equitable
Life Assurance and the Car-
nagie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching. Fur-
ther, he was recently appointed
chair of the Rockefeller Foun-
dation, of which he has been a
trustee for several years.

However, he does not feel the
new chairmanship will take
away from his duties as
chancellor. He said the new
position will take two or three
more days a year for meeting.
He added that he may drop a
few extra activities, which had
the same level of time involved,
in order to keep within the ceil-
ing of outside activity time he
has set for himself.

“Any external activities] am
involved in must be approved
by the (SUNY) Board of
Trustees,“ Wharton said. He
feels the members of the board
are very “independent minded”
and they will not approve
everything he proposes.

Wharton also does not view
his position as a trustee of the
Ford Motor Company board,
which has numerous holdings in
South Africa, as conflicting
with his strong opposition of
racial segregation held by the
government there.

Wharton said he would be in
favor of total economic sanc-
tions against South Africa.
although he does not feel a

 

even more (money)," Kuncn
said, adding that Popper was
thankful, but declined addi-
tional pay.

Popper needs this salary in
order to remain in Albany,
’Kunen said, adding that all of
Popper's financial aid was
taken away once he lost his stu—
dent status.

The money allocation still has
to be approved by Central
Council as a whole, as the newly
created position of executive
director, for which the’salary is
being furnished.

Wharton’s wife Dolores also
has a corporate career to com-

brought her an appointment by
President Ford to the National
Council for the Arts of the Na-
tional Endowment for the Arts.
She serves on the corporate
boards of directors of Phillips"

Kellogg Company and Gannett
Newspapers.
