Storm Sinks Oil Rig
'ST. JOHN’S, Newfoundland (AP) One of the
world’s largest oil rigs sank Monday in a howling
North Atlantic storm off the coast of New-
foundland and 84 workers aboard were missing
and feared dead.

Rescue planes and ships battled poor visibility
in rain and snow in a search for any survivors. The
rig operator, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., said bodies
were spotted in the water where the rig had been
Operating, 175 nautical miles east of St. John‘s.

' The men had been ordered to abandon the rig

when it developed a IS-degrcc list after a night-.

long beating in gale winds and snow, Mobil said.

About nine hours later, Mobil issued an official

statement that the Ranger had gone dowrt.

Two Iifcboats 'werc sighted by search air—
craft—one capsized and the other stern-down in
the water. A partially inflated lit'erat't ttistr was.
seen, rescue authorities said.

A search and rescue spokesman in Halifax said
waves as high. as 40 feet made it imprissiblc to
retrieve bodies although ttrgs in the area could see
them ﬂoating.

GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (Al') llomted
gunmen killed an American missionary irr
Guatemala as the Roman Catholic brotlter worked
outside the boarding school where taught. na-
tional police and church officials said Sunday.

Brother James Alfred Miller, 37. was attaeked
by several “heavily armed men“ late Saturday
afternoon as he repaired a large window at the
school in Huchuctanango. I65 miles northwest oi
Guatemala City, authorities said.

political struggle between left and tieitt.

Arm Sales Causes Furor

JERUSALEM. Israel (AP) iSt'tlt'i's i':ttll:tttt:'tll
voted overwhelmingly today to express “deep . ort-
cern" over a possible U.S. sale of anti-aircraft
missiles and F-l6 warplanes to Jordan.

Prime Minister Mcnachcm IIegin said such a
sale would violate a pledge from President Reagan
to preserve Israel's military advttttlttyc over the
Arabs, and the Israeli leader moved swiftly to br-
ing the Opposition Labor Party in Parliament into
a united front with bitn.

By a vote of 88-3, with six rthslctttitnrs, the
Knesset parliament approved a resolution calling
on Reagan and the Congress “to retrain Itorn a
danger so grave to Israel‘s security.“ |)'elense
Secretary Caspar Weinbergcr proposed the arms
sale last week during a trip to Arab states in the
Middle East.

Poles Stage Demonstration

WARSAW, Poland (AP) The military govern-
ment today denounced instigators of a mass
demonstration in the city of Poznan. and said ex-
tremists in the suspended Solidarity union were
plotting anti-government terrorism and revenge.

An article by a general in the Communist Party
daily Trybuna Ludu blamed the Saturday protest,
involving at least 200 pe0ple, on underground
leaﬂets spread by Solidarity and said they inelttded
slogans such as “death to the Reds" and “there
will be a bloody civil war here."

The paper also made a rare criticism of
Poland’s powerful Roman Catholic church, say-
ing priests incited political tension by “recurring
provocative pronouncements and political
gestures.”

Gen. Norbert Miehta wrote that Solidarity ex-
tremists were spreading the leaflets “calling for
conspiracy and even terrorist and revanehist
vengeful acts.”

The official PAP news agency said police jailed

't94 screaming demonstrators in Poznan during
the rally which marked the two months since mar-
tial law was imposed Dec. I3.‘No injuries were
reported. 

- 'Wiuiamsiﬁospitaiized

ATLANTA, Georgia (AP) Wayne B. Williams
was taken to a hospital today, just before the
lunch recess in his murder trial, and there were un‘-
confirmed reports that he was vomiting and
bleeding from the nose.

Williams was hurried out of the courtroom and
checked by a doctor at Grady Memorial Hospital.
Beverly Thomas, a hospital spokeswoman, said
she was unable to say what the 23-year-old black
man was suffering from.

Williams, a free-lance photographer and aspir-
ing talent promoter, is on trial for murder itt the
deaths of Jimmy Ray Payne, 2t, and Nathaniel
Cater, 27, two of the 28 young blacks whose slay-
ings over a 22-month period were investigated by a
special police task force.

No arrests have been tnade in the other cases,
but prosecutors ltave presented evidence in It)
deaths in an effort to show a pattern that might fit
the Payne and ( ater slayings.

Haig Reassures Israel

NEW YORK, New York (AP) Scct'ttuty tll “dale
Alexander l-laig has reiterated the Reagan adv
ministration‘s support for Israel httt added that it
would not be given at the expense of relations -\ itlr
its‘Arab neighbors.

The question of U.S.-Israeli relations has raised
anew last week when Defense SCt'Iclat‘) ('ttxpttt
Weinbcrgcr discussed the sale oi arltant'ul l-I(r
fighter planes and mobile llarvt anti-aimat't
missiles to .lordarr during a tisit to the Mideast.

An unidentified official on \\‘etnherger‘s ~.t.rtl
was quoted in Sunday's Ncu Yorl 'l imcL to 'rtl_\illt‘
the Reagan administration wa- trying to
“redirect” Middle Iiast military II'IiII‘:-' array tt'tntt
Israel.

Haig, interviewed Sunday on Allt ’-'l \"s “ l his '

Week With David llrinklcy“ show, said redirect
was “a very incorrch word."

()ttr policy toward Israel has not changed and I
do not contemplate that it will change in the
period nitcad," he said, adding. "It does not mean
we do not seek good relations with moderate Arab
states in the region."

Ambassador Criticizes (ﬂV '

WASHINGTON, l).C. (AP) The United Nations
is “a very dismal show" in which conflicts are
worsened rather than resolved, US. Ambassador
Jeane .I. Kirkpatrick cltargcd Monday. \

She told 225 leaders of the American Legion on.

Monday that some UN. agencies, including its
rcfrrgcc commission, the World Health Organira-

'tion and it nreteorologieal service, do “very

positive things which we would all be happy to
contribute to."

But site added, “If we look at what happens in
New York ottt in the Security Council and in the
General Assembly, then I guess I believe it is a
very dismal show. And what is worse, its effect, I
think, is almost precisely the opposite of the inten-
tions of the founders of the United Nations . . .
above all to assist in conflict resolution."

“What we find instead is that conflicts, rather
than being resolved there are itr fact polarized, ex-
tended and exacerbated. They are rnrtch harder to
solve ratltcr than easier to solve. generally speak-
ing," she said.

Asylum Sought in Japan

TOKYO. Japan (AP) I-‘our Polish mcrclntnt
scarttett have asked for political asylum in the west
and are rrndcr Japanese police protection, the
Forcing Ministry said Monday.

Ministry officials said the four, who made the
request Sunday, were among 44 crewrncn on the
7,8l7-ton Polish freighter “Lcleu'cl.” The vessel
arrived Satttrday at liakata, on Japan's southern-
most island of Kyushu to pick up a cargo of 4,000
tons of rice dortatcd by the Japanese government.

The officials declined to discuss further details.

Sixteen Polish sailors defected in Japan shortly
after Poland was placed under military rule illSl
Dec. 13. and were grarttcd political asylum in
Canada and Australia.

N
In just one short month the race
for governor of New York has
taken a dramatic twist. Early in
January it seemed apparent that
Hugh L. Carey would gear up
his campaign machine for a run
at a third term as governor.
However, his surprise an-
nouncement that he would not
seek re-election
has thrown the
race up in the air
and opened the
door for many
eager Demoerats.

Carey’s decision not to run
has not had a noticeable effect
on the Republicans. There are
currently two declared can-
didates: businessman Lewis E.
Lehrman and Comptroller Ed-
ward V. Regan. Two others,
Assembly Minority Leader
James L. Emery, Jr. and
Richard M. Rosenbaum,
Republican national commit-
teeman, seem likely to enter the
race.

The Democratic side,
however, is not as clear cut.
While only Lieutenant Gover-
nor Mario M. Cuomo has an-
nounced a definite intention to,
seek the nomination, there are a
flurry of others examining their
political futures, debating the—

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS, FeaaUAav 16, 1982

Carey Leaves Gubernatorial JDbWide' Open

possibilities and consequences ’

of taking a shot at the Executive
Mansion. ,

Aside from Cuomo, other
prominent Democrats consider-
ing a run for governor include:
Assembly Spegker Stanley Fink,
New York City Council Presi-
dent Carol Bellamy; Senate
minority Iead'er Manfred
Ohrenstein; Attorney General
Robert Abrams; State Power
Authority chairman John S.
Dyson and Howard
Samuels—loser to Carey in the
gubernatorial primary in I974.

Perhaps the most prominent
Democrat to hint at tossing his
hat into the ring is New York
City Mayor Edward Koch.
Koch, who once said that living
in Albany would be a “fate
worse than death," has more
recently commented, “You
have to die sooner or later."

Koch threw the race into tur-
moil three weeks ago when he
was asked If he would run and
replied, “Maybe.” He an-
nounced yesterday that he will
reveal his decision on February
24.

His decision to have his name
included on the list of possible
candidates was a shock to his
colleagues on that list. All have
been forced to re-evaluate their
positions. I

Abrams, who was expected to '
announce this month his deci-
sion on whether he would run,
has, according to an aide, decid-
ed to wait until Koch commits
himself one way or the other.
Dyson said that if Koch runs he
will support him.

What does all of this do to the

.gubernatorial race of 1982? it

makes it wide open. The
Democrats and Republicans will
fight it out separately until the
September primaries. which will
eliminate the losers, when the
two major party nominees will
ﬁght each other (and any minor
party candidates) till one
emerges victorious in the
November 2 election.

Both parties can anticipate
multi-candidate primaries and
fierce campaigns. Among
Republicans, Regan is con
sidered the front-runner, as he
has the highest name-
recognition and a successful
campaign staff which won him
the position of Comptroller
four years ago.

Lehrma‘n, who has vowed to
put $12 million into his cam-
paign, is probably the
wealthiest, although the least
known, of the candidates. In an
effort to make himself’known,‘
Lehrman launched an early
television advertising blitz and

is expected to advertise heavily
over the next few months.

An upstater, ‘Emery claims to
have the support of several in-
fluential Republican county
leaders; However, in the back
‘of his mind m_ust be the thought
that he would have to give up
his Assembly minority leader
role. He must also remember
the fate of Perry Bureau the
Assembly minority leader
beaten by Carey in his I978 re-
election.

Rosenbaum, the only
moderate in the Republican
race, was the Republican State.
Chairman for many years and
has a solid backing of support.
He does not have the support,
however, of the current State
Chairman, GeOrge L. Clark,
Jr., who_is backing Regan.

It is even harder to examine
the Democrats because there are
eight candidates, of which all
but Cuomo have refrained from
committing themselves.

Fink, Abrams and Ohrenstein
have the most to lose in a guber-
natorial campaign because they
would be precluded from runn-
ing for re-elcction to retain their
current positions. Koch and
Bellamy, on the [other band, do
not risk their offices by running
as both were re-elected just last
year.

Governor Carey
Left the race wide open

Bellamy has the advantage of
being the only woman. Cuomo
is the only Catholic. Dyson is
the only Democrat not from
New York City., Pink and
Ohrenstein have considerable
power and support as a result of
their offices. Cuomo and
Abrams have a high name-.
recognition as a result of being
statewide office holders. And
Koch won re-election for mayor
last year by a landslide in which
he had bi-partisan support.

One month ago the race for
governor looked like a bore: the
incumbant Carey versus an
underdog Republican. Now,
who knows? As the campaign
heats up it's every man or
woman for him/her self.

Writer Sees Rev..Falwell asThreat

By BETH BRINSER

The Reverend Jerry Falwell
and the Moral Majority’s
“threat” upon democracy in
America was subjected to an at-
tack irt a speech given Thursday
night by freelance Penthouse in-

vestigative reporter Ernest
Volkman.
Volkman’s Thursday night

appearance in the Campus
Center Ballroom was sponsored
by Speakers Forum.

has become
familiar with Reverend
Falwell"s Moral Majority since
he was hired over a year ago by

Penthouse magazine to in-
vestigate the group’s use of
funds.

After the publication of the
articles, Penthouse was brought
to court by Falwell on defama-
tion claims. However, the case
was thrown out of court.

Penthouse and Volkman have
received over 8,000 letters in
resonse to the investigation.
With the exception of six letters,
most of the correspondents
warned Volkman he “was going
to burn in Hell for writing for
that scum sheet.”

Volkman believes the Moral

SlﬂV YA Has New Law Program

By BARBARA RISALVATO ,
_____l______......_.

SUNYA freshman can now
obtain a law degree in six years,
instead of the standard system,
through a new program offered
In conjunction with Albany
Law School.

This “3 plus 3 prOgram” in-
.cludes three years of
undergraduate study at SUNYA
followed by three years at
Albany Law, according to
Assistant Dean for Special Ser-
vices for the Center for
Undergraduate EducatiOn
Robert Gibson.

In order to qualify, incoming
students should have a combin-
ed SAT score of at least 1250,
with 600 or better on the verbal
section, and should rank among
the top to percent of their
graudating class. Students must
also be accepted by both this

  

    

university and Albany Law
before being admitted to the
program.

Currently-enrolled freshmen
can also apply, if

is a 3.2 or better, Gibson said.
Once admitted to the pro-
gram, a student must have a
cum of 3.4 by their junior year
in order to retain their reserved
spot in Albany Law, Gibson ad-

He said they want to impose

“not my religion, not yours, but- '

theirs. (They believe) the fun-
damental Christain doctrine
should be enacted and imposed
upon society. They want to
create a theocracy.

“The United States is facing a
new ‘Ayatollohism.’ Like Iran.
we now ltave a group of people
who believe for the first time (in
US. history) in a wedding of
religion and politics."

According to Falwell,
Volkman said, separation of

church and state is “an Idea
created by the devil to keep us
from being the righteous leaders
or this country.”

Volkman maintains the effect
of the Moral Majority in the
past two years has been astoun-
ding. In several southern states,
they have had books by Philip
Roth, and Sidney Sheldon, as
well as the novel The Brave New
World, removed from libraries.
The Moral Majority has block-
ed ERA passage in fifteen
states, and so-called “crea-
