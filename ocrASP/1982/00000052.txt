athletic
support ers

Male jocks are getting a taste
of their own medicine in the
current Women Sporls
magazine. The February edition
features male
athletes—including football
defensive back Burgess Owens
and tennis pro Peter Ren-
nert—clad only in some very
revealing swim trunks. The
editors say the feature is their
tongue-in-cheek answer to
Sports lllustraled's swimsuit
edition, which each winter
presents female models in
similar poses.

PBS goes
commercial

You may have already notic-
ed company logos showing up
just bci'Ore public television
prOgrams, but that low-key
advertising is just the beginning:
ten public stations have received
permission to sell adver-
tisements between shows, in an
experiment designed to test the
motley-making power of the
financial]y-strappcd system. if
it works, the commercials could
spread to other PBS stations.
but officials aren't sure the idea
is as lucrative as it first appears.
For instance, the ten stations
will have to win waivers from
labor unions, which usually de-
mand higher wages at commer-
cial stations.

pamphlet burning

A new controversy is develop-
ing in Washington over a dec-
sion by the environmental pro-
tection'agency to halt circula-
tion of most of its education
pamphlets. Nearly 90 percent of
the pamphlets are being
withdrawn, including those on
pesticide safety and how to keep
poisons away from children.
The move was denounced by
Audubon Society President
Russell Peterson as “en-
vironmental book burning."
but EPA official Byron Nelson
said it’s aimed only at
eliminating duplication and out-
dated material. Besides, he said.
the books would be turned into
recycled paper -— not btirncd.

deaf justice

in tile first case of its kind, a
deaf lawyer is demanding that
the supreme Court provide inter-
preting equipment, so he can
understand the justices when he
argues a case before them later

crime decline

Some encouraging news on ,

the crime front: despite
widespread concern over rising
crime, the nation’s crime rate is
leveling off and may actually
start to decline. in fact, some
scientists believe the surge in
violent crime that began in the
late sixties is part of a 50-year
crime cycle. The nation‘s
homicide rate, they point out,
was almost as high in l933, but
declined by more than half the
following decade. “Our best
evidence." says Rutgers Univer-
sity (‘riminologist Richard
Sparks, “shows that crime is no
more a problem than it ever
was—and it‘s certainly not get-
ting worse."

Still, the statistics don‘t ex-
acliy make you feel safe: one
researcher calculated that a

gun happy

The National Rifle Associa-
tion is spending one-and-a-
quarter million dollars to con-
vince you they’re not the gun-
toting villains portrayed by gun
control groups. The NRA is
launching a series of magazine
ads featuring, in the words of
their advertising executive.
“Smiling PeOplc, who Don‘t
Look Aggressive." Some of the
smiling faces are well-
known—former astronaut Wal-
ly Schirra is pictured in one
ad——-while others are run-of—the-
mill gun owners, including an
Oklahoma City second grader
who appears along with the cap-
tion, “1 like to play football
best, but i like my dog and i like
my new [3.1). gun.” But even a
seven-figure budget may not be
enough to create a laid-back im-
age for the NRA: the ads have
already been turned down by
the New Yorker, Texas Monthly
and National Geographic
magazines.
