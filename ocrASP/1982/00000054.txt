graduated with a B.A. in
History in I947. and went on
the .lohn Hopkins University
for a Masters degree in Interna-

tional Affairs. The University
of Chicago awarded him an
M.A. in Economics in I956 and

received a myriad of honorary

degrees from other universities._

Wharton has shied from in-
volvement in partisan politics
and has refused to comment on
the possible effects that the up-
coming gubnatorial election
may have on his position.

He has been involved in the
field of U.S. foreign policy. ser-

the State Department involving
agricultural development in
Asia and South America.

Wharton views the cuts to
education in the proposed
Reagan budget as “absolutely
horrendous" and will be in
