“I was surprised that 1 got
thrown to my back — it was the
first time all year," explained
Seras. -

It wasn't long before the
defending SUNYAC champ
regained control -— he went on
to an 8-5 win. “He’s a great
You don't really
worry much when a champion is
down four points — but
Morone deserves respect,"
commented DeMeo.

Capturing second place in the

v heavyweight class was Albany

team eo-captain Vie Herman. in
what was labeled as a “grudge
match,”,Herman ltad to wrestle
Oneonta‘s Rob Jasaitis in the
semifinals. The duo had split
their two matches during
regular season dual meet com—
petition, ruining Herman's
otherwise undefeated record
(20-l).

The most recent match was

‘ on par with their past com-

petitiveness, as Herman edged
out his foe 7-6. “When you
come back and beat a guy who
beat you l3-1, you can come
back from almost anything,"
said DeMeo.

Herman, however, could not
come back in the finals, as
Brockport’s two-time i’eturning
SUNYAC champ Chris Haley
pinned the Albany junior in six
minutes.

“Jasaitis was the one i
wanted to beat in this tourney

: — anything more is just gravy,"

said Herman before his final
match.

Warren Wray, struggling
four years to reach his peak,
captured a third place in the
lZ6-pound weight class.
“Sometimes, when guys are put
under that kind of pressure they
crumble, but Warren rose to the
occasion," said DeMeo.

After the senior won his
opener, 10-7, he met defeat in
the second round against the
eventual second place finisher,
Lou Chartrantl. However, in his
third make-or-brcak match,
Wray crushed his opponent
mentally and physically, 10-0,
and qualified for the N(‘AAs.

Since the top four of each
weight class in the SUNYACs
qualify for the Nationals.

finishers was merely a matter of
pride. Thus, the 126-pounder
was plenty proud when he beat
Tom Murphy 21-16 for thethird
spot. “Warren paid his dues,
finally, he got his reward,"
observed teammate Herman.

Dave Averill also captured a
third place finish, soundly
defeating his final challenger,
15-6. "My goal was to get in the
top three — l fulfilled my goal.
In two weeks (the NCAAS) is
when it really counts," noted
Averill.

“Dave has certainly done a
great job as of this point as a
freshman. He is still finding out
a lot of things about himself,,"
said Coach DeMeo. The
llﬂ-pounder was Albany‘s lone
freshman qualifier.

in what was probably the
most skilled weight class, Ed
Gleason was able to squeak into
the fourth spot at 150 pounds.

SUNYAC champ Kregg Bruno,
Gleason wrestled back into
glory. The sophomore fir'st edg-
ed out Scott Schaddock, 4-3,
and then had a breathtaking
overtime victory over second
seed Sal DeSantos to become a
national qualifier.

“lf l wrestle the duality
wrestling 1 did today
(Saturday), I should fair well in
the nationals - maybe an All-
Ameriean,” said Gleason.

The six qualifiers all haVe

kept alive that dream of becom- ‘

ing the honored All-American.
However, with the end of the
1982 SUNYACs came the end
of three Albany seniors college
wrestling careers.
Co-captain Bill Papazian
earned a spot on Albany’s star-
ting linc-up, beating out a team-
mate who was several pounds
heavier than himself. “He has
been a tremendous help to me
over the years. When elected

Dave IStrguIb made a good cf-
fort in his weight class. but
failed to advance to the semi-
finals. “Dave has been a real
contributor to the team. He was
willing to move aorund in
weight classes, and really won a

lot of ‘matches for us," reflected

the coach.

The third senior, Ed Morales,
made an accomplishment mere-
l'y by making it down to his star-
ting weight of 190. After the
loss of 45 pounds, Morales was
not at full strength f0r the
SUNYACs. '
