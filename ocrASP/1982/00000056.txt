By MICHAEL CARMEN

The women’s swimming
team, continuing their assault
on the record books and surging

toward the New York State'

Tournament, defeated St.
Michaels Collcgc 82-57.

Sheila Fitzpatrick, who has
been a big assaultcr, brokc yet
another record in the 500 yard
freestyle. She recorded a 5:52.1
clocking and a first place finish.

In the 50 yard fly Carol Lim
flew to a first place finish. Hcr
time of 51.3 was also a personal
low.

"We rccordcd some really
good times. We have been
swimming consistently even
though our linc-up was not.our

strongest," said Dulce Fcr-
nandcz, womcn's swimming
coach.

Carol Higgins only placed
fourth in the 100 yard
backstroke, but Itcr time of
1:19.71 was a "good effort"
and a personal low. Barb Van
Stykc also recorded a personal

low and qualified for the States
after her performance in the 100
yard frccstylc.

The diving events were owned
by Albany as Lynn Ranncy,
Joan Mciklcham, and Denise
Dcutsch swept the one meter rc-
quircd divc rcspcctivcly.

Last Thursday the Danes fell
to Hamilton 78-60, but the mcct
was not without outstanding
Albany performances.

Susan Kcilty placcd first as
she outdid Fitzpatrick in the 100
yard l'rccstylc. Kcilty‘s time,
58.52, was a new school rccord,
erasing Fitzpatrick‘s time of
59.1.

Kcilty as usual, was not hap-
py with one rccord and etched
her name on the linc ncxt to 100
yard individual medley. Site, in-
cidcntly, won the cvcnt clocking
in at 1:08.97.

“Hamilton swam very well,
btrt we did have onc bud brcak
as Fitzpatrick was disqualified
after two false starts in the 100
yard freestyle. That upsct her a
little,” added Fernandez.

The Dane swimmer waited for
the gun and exploded to a
school record in the 200 yard
freestyle.

“Shcila was determined. Shc
felt dcprivcd. but eventually fclt
really good," cvalttatcd the

today," said Munscy. “I think
the onc most important element
of our team's success is our
overall depth. We have a lot of
people who can come in and do
the job, especially in the large
events. Today we really started
to get going with the high
hurdles. We're a little weak in

tile long distance running
cvcnts, but with our overall
tcam dcpth I think we’ll be able
to give the big teams like Cor-
tland and Frcdonia a run for
their money."

Albany is now 7-5. The team
travels to Plattsburgh next
Saturday for a dual meet.
