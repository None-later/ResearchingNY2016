ONEONTA —- Great expecta-
tions became realitieS'this past
weekend as six Albany State
wrestlers placed high enough in
the SUNY Athletic Conference
Tournament to qualify for the
national Division 111 competi-
tion. Altogether the Danes cap-
tured two firsts, one second,
two thirds, one fourth place —
adding up to the highest finish
the school had ever accomplish-
ed in the SUNYACs.

Last Friday and Satur
day eight SUNY schools battled
it out and more than lived up to
their reputation as the toughest
Division 111 wrestling con-
ferencc in the nation. Albany
finished a solid fourth with
85.75 points, trailing the first
three teams from Brockport
(149), OswegoU 13.5), and Buf-
falo (94). The three leading
squads were ranked number
one, two, and seven, respective-
ly, out of the country's 350
Division 111 schools.

“it was a great team effort.

They scored more points than
any other team 1 had ever
coached in a major
tournament," contntented head
coach .loe DeMeo. ln facl,the
six place winners represettt a
new school record for the most
qualifiers that Albany has ever
sent to the NCAAs.

Out of the tournament’s ten

weight class champions, two
hailed from Albany. Spero
Theofilntos and Andy Seras
captured the 134 and 142-wcigltt
class titles, respectively.

Thcofilatos, seeded fourth
among the 134 pounders, ptit
forth “a performance that was
nothing short of unbelievable,”
claimed DeMeo.

Forced to wrestle the top
seed, All-American Robert Car-
bo in the semi-finals, the Dane
junior knew he had his hands
full. However, putting Carbo’s
reputation out of his mind,
Tlteofilatos took an early 8-3
lead. But Carbo had no inten-
sion of giving tip as he struggled
back to go on top, 9-8. There

was less than 25 seconds re-
maining the the match when
Theofilatos finally maneuvered
two reversals and racked tip a
12-10 decison.

"1 made some mistakes —
but 1 still pulled it out,” noted
the champion. “As soon as 1
made it to the finals 1 was pretty
confident that l was going to
win it all.”

A solid 14-9 victory over se-

‘cond seed Andrew Komarek

gave Theofilat0s the first place
finish. “Throughout the mat-
ches he had moments of ab-
solute brilliance — and that is
what won it for him iii the
end," said DeMeo.

Seras, on the other hand,
paved a much smoother path to
the t0p. A pin in the first round,
followed by a convincing 15-7
win in his second match, enabl-
ed the sophomore to breeze into
the finals. At last the All-
American was forced to wrestle
up to his name, as his
challenger, Mike Morone, went
out to an early 4-0 lead.

Three Team Race in East

 

By LARRY KAHN

With the SUNY Conference
tournament less titan two weeks
away, the nuntbcr of teams still
in contention is dwindling
down. The East division race
now appears to feature three
teams vying for two playoff
positions—Albany, Potsdam
and Cortland.

Oneonta had an outside
chance before Saturday, but the
Red Dragons were handed their
fourth conference loss when
Albany defeated them in
Unitcrsity Gym, 65-55.

“it’s still mathematically
possible to get into the playoffs
with four losses," noted Oneon-
ta basketball coach Don
Flewelling. “But now We have
to depend on Plattsburgh and

Binghamton."
Oneonta did not. want to de-
pend on those two teams;

neither of them has beaten any
of the other four teams in the
East. For the Red Dragons,
Saturday night’s game was a do-
or-die situation.

“i knew they would be psych-
edwhen they came in here,"
said Albany coach Dick Sauers.

Oneonta had also been hot of
late. Winners in nine of their
last 11 contests after a slow
start, they had all their hOpes
riding on this game.

But another conference loss
would put Albany in a
precarious position as well.

They too were psyched.

Mike (ialto and John
Dicckelman scored cigltt points
each iii the first 10 minutes of
play to stake Albany to a quick
18‘10 lead. But the Dragons
roared back. They scored cigltt
unanswered points itt under two
minutes and tied the game.

Albany pttllcd oitt to a 28-25
advantage with 3:10 left lit the
half, and Oneonta called a time
out. When they rctttrttcd, the
Red Dragons froze the
ball—Dan Bagan stood near the
thc'sideline with the ball tucked
under his arm for two and a half
minutes. The Danes refused to
move. With 14 seconds left,
Oneonta played for the last
shot, but they failed.

"We weren't trying to pull
them out of the zone," explain-
ed Flewelling, who said he
would have held the ball even if
Albany did come out of the
zone. Flewelling wanted to go
into the half down by one or
three points rather than risk let-
ting the Dancs get hot.

The strategy worked well,
momentarily, when Oneonta
knotted the game at 30-30 early
in the second half. But Albany
creeped back into the lead and
never let go. The Red Dragons
ltung on, but could not get
closer than three. The Danes led
byjust four. 49-45, with 4:51 re-
maining, but then reeled ol'f six
straight points, providing the

winning margin.
"That was the most enthusiasm
l‘ve seen Albany play witlt all
year." said Fleivclling.
“Their whole group, they‘re
physical and we're not. We‘re
not a physical team and that
httrts us at times."

Oneonta's defensive strategy
was to neutralize Dane

playtnaker Dart Crontier. They ,

did, lintiting the diminutive

point guard to four points and
four assists, btit they opened up
the middle for Dicckelman (21
points) and Gallo (season high
20) points). Dennis Fagan pitch-
cd iii 10 points conting off the
bench.

“Fagan gave us ti lift," said
Sauers. “Fagan's getting better
every game. He's playing with
ntorc intensity than when he
first'canie here.”

Two Games This
Week Pivotal
For Playoff Bid

By LARRY KAHN

 

The Albany Great Danes re-
main atop the SUNY Con-
ferencc East division with a 7-1
record, but they ltave two
critical games still to play.
These games should decide
which two teams will go to the
SUNYAC tournatnent.

The Danes will try to avenge
an earlier loss to Cortland when
the Red Dragons roll into
University Gym on Wednesday
at 8:30. That earlier 71-67 set-
back was Albany‘s only con—
ference loss, but it makes
Wednesday‘s rematch pivotal.

“That was a very tough loss
down there," said Albany
basketball coach Dick Sauers.
“if we had won that we could
be packing our bags right
now."

Cortland is now in third
place, at 5-3, but if they defeat
the Danes again and win‘ their
other conference game, then
Saturday's Albany-Potsdam
game in Potsdam should decide
tlte playoff teams.

Potsdant, in second place at
6-2, clinches a bid if they beat
Plattsburgli on Wednesday. 11'
Albany loses to Cortland and
beats Potsdam then botlt Cor-
tltind and Potsdam will finish-at
7-3, Albany at 8-2. Potsdam
would get the second bid
because they have beaten (‘or-
tland twice already.

StateWide Rally Draws 250

By DEBBIE JUDGE

 

Approximately 250 students
representing nine SUNY campuses
protested the dorm rent increases
and reduced financial aid proposed
iit next year's budget at a
Rally/Lobby Day held at SUNY-
Central and the Capitol Tuesday.

The students' goal was to urge
legislators to reappropriate the 9.9
million dollars proposed to be cut
from the SUNY budget, and to pitt
pressure on the SUNY Board of
'l'rustees to be ntroe responsive to
student needs.

Organizers of the protest felt the
lobbying especially went well.

SASU Chair .liitt Ticrncy felt the
legislators he spoke to were recep-

tive to student protest of faculty
and staff cuts although. "room rent
doesn‘t look too good — it doesn’t
seem to have much of a chance.”

SASU Communications Director
Marilyn Appleby also felt
legislators were impressed by the
student lobbying effort, saying she
heard, “positive cotntneitts front
various assembly people mid
senators."

Students frottt Cortland, Pur-
chase, Potsdam, Oneonta, New
Ptiltz, Oswego, Bingliamton and
Buffalo also lobbied on issues of in-
terest to their localities, such as the
closing of Squire Hall on the SUNY
Buffalo campus.

SASU representative Alitn
Weincr noted. “The fuel that it’s an

'election year makes the legislature
more susceptible," especially as
several college communities allow
students to vote in their district.

Richard Gillman, Vice
Chancellor for University Affairs at
SUNY-Central noted that the pro-
test wns "orderly and well-
conducted." He, however, had one
major reservation, concerning the
student’s attacks on Chancellor
Clifton Wharton —- “on a person
basis,“ which Gillman described as
“unnecessary arid unwarranted."

Wharton appeared a centrttl
target of the protest, front SASU’s

ed to SUNY," to ’l‘icrney‘s cull iii

She said the committee would
