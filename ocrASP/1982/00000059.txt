SUNY Budget Priorities Questioned

 

 

Earner-nu om

To the Editor:

Governor Carey recently released his
Executive Budget for 1982-83. Within
this budget, SUNY spending priorities
are revealed and give a clear indication
to students of what changes in services
to expect. The recommended gross
operation budget for SUNY totals $1.2
billion. This represents an increase
over last year’s budget of $62.6
million, but falls short of SUNY’s
original request of $140 million in-
crease over last year. in reality, this
budget will mean reduced services for
96 percent of the student body. The on-
ly divisions of the university that will
receive any real funding are the Health
Science Centers (HSC).

The HSCs will receive art additional
$31 million in Operation funds. This in-
crease represents 50 percent of the net
increase in the entire university budget.
The HSCs represent 25 percent of the
SUNY budget and will service only 4
percent of the total SUNY population.
()1' the total increase, $21 million will
be used to operate the hospitals. By
diverting funds from other university
operations, the hospitals will thrive at
the expense of other academic pro-
grams. Tltc Governor‘s office did not
set these spending priorities. These
recommendations were made by SUNY
in the proposed university budget last
fall.

in SUNY‘s proposal. an attempt was

made to mask the disproportion by
lumping the HSCs at Buffalo and
Stony Brook with lite University
Centers, which artificially inﬂated the
increase to the university centers. Put-
ting the medical sellools in the Medical
Center category where they belong
makes it clear that the University
Centers were on the line from the
beginning to receive a decrease in fun-
ding. This in turn means reduced ser-
vices.

All the other divisions of
SUNY—the Colleges of Arts and
Sciences, the Agricultural and
Technical Colleges, the Specialized and
Statutory Colleges, even the Programs
for the Disadvantaged—had similar
“real money" budget cttts in the very
beginning. Only the medical centers
were slotted for growth in the original
budget. The Executive Bridget rein-
forces SUNY‘s recommendations.

These are the funding priorities that
have been set, not by the state but by
SUNY. it is very worrisome to think of
what services will he reduced in the
final budget that the legislature ac-
cepts. Inven before the legislature
slashes at it, SUNY’s proposed 1982-83
budget doesn‘t meet the needs of the
overwhelming majOrity ol' the
students.

Social Security Cuts For Students

 

 

To the Editor:

600,000 college students are losing
their Social Security student benefit
checks starting this summer, and they
are not being notified of it by the
Social Security Administration. They
will not receive any benefits for May,
June, July and August, and beginning
in the fall, their monthly benefits will
be decreased an additioinal 25 percent.
Additional decreases are scheduled in
following years. Summer monthly
benefits will cease whether or not the
student is attending summer classes.

The Social Security Administrator,
John Svahn, stated on CBS News, that
the students are not being notified
because “we don‘t know who they
are." (The Morning Show, Janurary
28).

Complete details are in the August,
1981 update of a Social pamphlet titat
has not been distributed. (SSA Pub.
05-10048, Aug., 1981). This pamphlet
also includes the fact that future
benefits will not include any increases
based upon cost-of—living.

Similarly affected are an estimated
40,000 high school seniors. Unless they
are enrolled and attending college
before this May, they will not be eligi-
ble for any benefits from Social Securi-
ty. Various educational groups, after
learning of the situation, have lobbied
on their behalf. Congressmen Solomon
(R-NY) and Volkmer (D-Mo) both in-

troduced legislation last week to extend
tltc deadline for the high school
seniors, But no one is speaking for the
college students. Efforts to fire-fight
the situation remain in House educa-
tional committees, and publicity in the
media has only f0cused upon the plight
of the high school seniors.

The basis for these cuts is 1981
federal legislation enacted because “of
other student aid prOgrams started
since 1965." (SSA, Aug. 1981). But
Pell Grants and loan programs are also
being cut. Since the affected students
are not being notified, they will miss
the financial-aid application deadlines
at their colleges. 600,000 unsuspecting
students will have an empty mail box
on June 3rd and an empty craw that
night.

Do not be misled by arguments that
the budget must be balanced and that
there is no need (financial) test for
these students. They are children of
dead and disable parents, and their
Social Security legacy is being taken
away. Other federal legislation in 1981
increased the legacy of the wealthy by
greatly reducing inheritance taxes

Machine Over Man

Again, today’s ASP looks a little odd. We still haven’t been
able to find a competent service engineer for our typesetter, so
we’ve had totdrastically cut back the size of the paper.

Also, our staff is beat. They’ve exhausted themselves putting
out the paper under the poor conditions they’ve faced. These peo-
ple deserve more than the long hours they put in for the little pay
they receive.

Man Over Man

The murders continue.

President Reagan wants to expand the role of American ad-
visors in El Salvador. He’d like to let them carry M-lés for “pro-
tection.” They’re not supposed to carry anything more powerful
than a sidearm, but being that they’ve been seen carrying them
already, the president would like to give them permission.

The dent/1 squads continue.

Secretary of State Haig keeps inferring in his offensively snide
way that US troops may end up in El Salvador.

The most powerful general in El Salvador says that the US should
send more guns, or we may have to get that government out of a
mess.

The pcuscnls continue to sir/Jeri

in Latin America, the debate whether to supply repressive
right wing juntas with more and more arms is not as academic and
clean as it is in North America. For peasants fighting for liberty,
the debate is a matter of life and death. More arms will mean their
death, and the life of the repressive regimes. Stopping the flow of
arms from the US. to the military juntas is their only chance for
freedom.

Our country is on the wrong side in El Salvador. A country
claiming to advocate individual rights has no business supporting a
government that slaughters its own citizens “for their own good.”
