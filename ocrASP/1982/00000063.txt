Finances Can Determine Housing DeCisions

By JERRY CAMPIONE

in the face of rising dorm rents
and other college-related expenses.
pus or to move to an off-campus
apartment is now rtrore a question
sontrl preference.

SUNYA‘s Office News
reports that a room Feature
on the uptoer cartr-

This cost includes one bed.
and one floor lamp and trrirtor per

student to supply. A prime example
is refrigerator rental which is ap-
proximately $69. Students must

also supply their own suite furniture r

and decorations.

Adding all the expenses. it costs
roughly $2.035 for an academic
year on campus.

Off-campus expenses vary. Ac-

cording to Karlcerr Carlson of the ’

Off-Campus Housing Office
(UCI l0) an average three bedroom
apartment ranges from SlZO-Slfll)
per rtrorrtlr with utilites. As is our
campus. phone service is extra.

As buying furniture cart be c\-

an aparttrrertt that comes \\illl sortrc

If it's necessary to eat on campus,

commuter meal cards are also”

available.

Heat and utilities comprise the
