self help

The current Self magazine has a
health suggestion that could protect
your ltcart and give you tnore time
to yourself: instead of using salt.
use garlic. Garlic. the magazine
says. seasons food without the cir-
culation problettrs associated with
salt. In fact. the rnagayine points to
research showing garlic may be a
blood tlrinrtcr that helps prevent
heart disease.

 

cheese please

The group that first proposed
distributing excess clteesc to the
rteedy now wants a variety of
surplus dairy products distributed
on tr regular basis. (‘alil‘ornia‘s
Public Advocates Incorporated is
asking President
turthorirc regular national distribu—
tiort ol' the billions of pounds of
tnilk. cheese and btrttcr purchased
tttrder federal price-support pro-
grams. Without strclt tr progratn.
the grortp says the government nray
dump the excess food in the ocean
— the original plan for disposing of
the cheese — or will spend more
than 50 tnilliotr dollars a year stor»
ing the commodities.

death talk

Nobody likes to be the hearei ol'.
bad news — least ol~ all doctors: a
survey of Texas physicians indicates
that while three-quarters of them

' believe dying patients should be

told of their condition. most don‘t
like to break the news. And nearly
half the Lone Star doctors admitted
trying to avoid directly telling pa-
tients they were dying. The study
shows younger doctors have the

most trouble dealing with death. 3

something Sotrtlrucstcr'n Medical
School l’rol‘essor luur |)unlrol' says
may not be a bad thing. “I‘ve often
told medical school students." he
says. “that ii they ever get to the
point where the loss of a patient
doesn't affect them. it's time to get
mtt ol' the profession."

 

Cleaning Up

Don't tell Arncricrt'scleaning and
repair businesses about hard
cconottric times. Business is up by
as much as 25 percent at
establishments that clean or rel‘ur-
bislt furniture or carpets. with
customers apparently deciding it's
more economical to restore what
they have than to buy new items.

shakey theory

llettcr circle March IO on your _

calendar: on that date all the
planets itt the solar system will be
lined up on the snare side of the sun.
And. according to a I974 book.
“The .Ittpitcr Factor." the align-
nrettt could trigger a tidal bulge on
the sun. affecting the earth's tota—
tion and setting off ntrtss' ” earth-
quakes irr California and elsewhere.
That's the bad news. The good
news is that ntost scientists don't
believe it will ltappctt. Al the
University of Minnesota. for exam-
ple. astronomer Kris Davidson.
calls the theory “nonsense.” First
of all. he says. the rough alignment
will catrse only a one ttrillitrrcter
bulge on the sun's surface. hardly

 

enough to cause a catastrophe here
on earth. And he says. the same
alignment has taken place before —
in ISO-tend I90l — with no percep-
tible consequences. The lineup will.
however. create a ﬁeld day for
amateur skywatchers. who will be
able to see no less than five planets
with the naked eye all at once.

 

assemb-lie

A Maryland legislator has come
rrp with wltat he says is the perfect
answer to his states‘s shady political
rcptttation: atrtrttal lie detector tests
for all 1le members of the state's
General Assembly. Under the plan
prrt forward by Baltimore county

 .  "

delegate} William hush, {every
December first,
would be lined up. strapped to a

polygraph. and :lntcrrogated by"

members of the opposing party’.
"All I'm trying to do," he told his
skeptical colleagues. "is have a little
deterrence hanging over your
heads." So far. the bill has failed to
attract much support In the
Assembly. despite ' his argunlent
that “it will keep some people out
of Jail."

scarely down

Business is down in Manitoba.
1nd that‘s good. Manitoba is the
center of Canada's loo-million-
dollar-a-year goose down industry
and. thanks to the bitter winter
weather in the U.S.. sales are up
despite the recession. Business is so
good. in fact. that Canada's geese
can‘t begin to keep up with the
down demand — 80 percent of the
feathers are imported. And China.
which is where most of them come
from. has decided the down
business is nothing to sneeze at.
They've started producing their
own down garments. and upped the
export price of down at a pace that
would mtrke_OPEC green with envy
— from fotrr dollars to 54 dollars it
pound.
