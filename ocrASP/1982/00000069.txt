This test does not measure your irr-
Ieiligence. your fluency with words. and cor
tairrly not your mathematical ability. It will.
however. give Some gauge of your normal
flexibility and creativity. Few takers solve
more than half of the 24 questions on the
first try. Many. however. reported geltirrg
answers long after the test had been set
aside. particularly at unexpected moments
when their minds are relaxed; and some
reported solving all the questions over a
period of several days. Take this as our per-
sonal challenge:

Woody: Should ' He?

To the Editor:

Regarding the Central Council proposal
to rehirc Woody Popper to a paying posi-
tion. 1 must say the idea turns my stomach.
it seems as though the Central Council is
trying to accept responsibility for Mr. Pop-
per's predicament. Furthermore thch is no
way I could be convinced that Mr. Popper
is the only person capable of performing
the duties of S.A. Vice President.

 

i must agree with the editorial in Tucs- '

day's ASP that said this ftrnction should he
performed by :1 student. if the Central
Cotrncil approves the measure I think it will
be a terrible mistake. The assumption of
Mr. Popper's financial aid is not the job of
the S.A. The S.A. should. and i hope. will
“get along without Woody" even though
he may have been an excellent officer.

Worldly Consideration

To the litlittrr:

there is no doubt [hill the World chk
at ASU is it wonderful event. All at lllt‘
events are well thought of and well planned.
it is indeed “A Celebration lll ()nr Diversi-
ty." for it reaches out to all races. “World
Week" is indeed a first class event.

it seems to me that on Colonial "class"
has become “trash.” When a person walks
into (‘olanitrl Qurrd cafeteria during World
Week What is be bound in sec? Posters at"
the great African nation of South Africa.
Johannesburg in all its glory. it would have
done just as well if they would have hung
posters of the Ku Klux Klan.

it scents that such an insensitive display
would not happen on a college campus. Arc

 

 
    
 
  
   

people so ignorant as to forget how sen-
sitive an issue South Africa is all over the
world? Are they so stupid as to forget that
to some black' people Johannesburg is
almost akin to. Auschwitz? Are they so
blind as to forget the uproar that arose right
here in Albany when the South African
Rugby team came to town? That was only
five months ago yet it seems people have
short memories. Such a display of bad taste
is uncalled for. No one warrants such
disrespect. They may have iust as well hung
a swnsli‘ka'and insulted cvcryonc.r Such
unintelligent behavior will only serve to in-
crease racial tensions that already exist in
America and all over the world.

SUNY Solidarity Appreciated

 

To the Editor:

Thanks. for Wayne l’ccrcbonm's “UB
Protest Leads to Arrests" and the “Youth
Aged” editorial (February Stir issue). ‘At
Friday nights “Symbolic Occupation" of
Squire Hall i was upstaged by a 73-year old.
Al Ricciuti. who received several standing
ovations for his militant poetry. The Squire
Hall struggle cuts across all barriers of age.
class and social position; in the end it
reduces to tire effort of the distant authority
of the State to destroy an immediate and
living social community.

| tell people it is our mind Vs. their
money. Mind is our only weapon; all the
material power is on their side. The powers
are out to grab $i3l million appropriated to
turn our Main Street campus into a Health
Sciences Complex. The $i8 ntillion Squire
Hull project is the lynch of their building,
scheme. if we ctrn pull it. their project will
collapse. And well it should - for the
benefit of the lax—payers. and the SUNY
system. Lisa Mirtrbciltr's “NY State irr-
crcasc Health Aid As SUNY Suffers." in
the ASP of (Feb. 5) mtrkcs the point well:
SUNY is being used to subsidize the
medical system and education is being
destroyed in the process. This is what the
Squire Hall fight is ultimately about.
Maybe it is mind vs. medicine (money and
medicine being equivalent terms today).
Here at Buffalo medicine is not about
health but money-making. Med students
take a required course called investments
for Physicians: all other courses are but
means to this grand cart.

Help us with the Squire l'ltill struggle.
Whirl they are doing to us they will sooner
Ul‘ltitL‘i‘ dour you. to the student communi—
ly throughout ler state. For some i2 years
here the “powers” have been chipping
away at student rights trnd privileges. While
UB‘s academic standing remains fairly
high. the qtutlily of student life is rated by
the New York Times Selective Guide I!)
Colleges as among the lowest in the nation.
lower even than Oral Roberts University in
Oklahoma. Fifteen years ago we were one
of the most exciting and interesting cum-

I

puscs in the country. Today it's the pits.
And this decline in the quality of otrr Slti—
dent life has coincided with a vast increase
itr expenditures at SUNYAB. Some 450
million has gone into the Amherst campus.
This spending is destroying the fabric of the
university community. while it
simultaneously bleeds the “taxpayers to
death.

I trope you can keep your eyes and cars
turned on the Squire Hall struggle. The
powers intend to take the building on Feb.
28. We intend to occupy the building. to
live in it because it is ours by legal right and
customary right. The building is boilr a stu-
dent union and a community center. (in fact
it was constructed with funds from the
Community Facilities Administration of the
federal government).

 

Because they have overwhelming physical
might they may well take the building from
us. In which case we will move outside and
continue to organize against them.

There is great freedom in being 56 years
old. Wiriic i am a tenured full professor i
ant quite willing to lay my academic
privilege on the line for the struggle to save
Squirt- ltuii. Should tircy fire me i shall corr-
tinue to fight itr other arenas.

i was really struck by the lililh quality of
journalism at the ASP. Keep up the good
work. ' .

Empty Words I

We should know better, right? After all, this is the age of cynicism, b t it
seems reasonable to put some trust in the word of authority figures. No ma er
1 how mrrcir we wish it wouldn't happen. politicians prove that they just can't say
one thing without contradicting themselves.

Take Ronald Reagan.

From the moment he accepted the nomination of the Republican Party, he
promised his opposition to draft registration. He told us it was unconscionable
0 consider pcucctinrc registration. llL‘ swore his resistance to any such program.

He lied.

Ronald Reagan will be the first president to send young men to prison for
resisting new draft registration program. a program he said he opposed. We
should havc'known better.

’ltrkc i-‘d Koch. please.

Koch has a mouth bigger than the city it comes from, and now he’s going to
llrrow it into the puiwrntnorial rave. if everything goes his way. the mayor of
New York will soon become the governor of New York.

it‘ll be interesting to see how he deals with the upstate leg of his campaign.

Man Over Machine (With Time)

After two and a halt" weeks of frustrated waiting. our typesetting machine is
iinally I‘epttll't‘tl. Slal'l' nrenrbcr's \vcrc lilcrtrlly dancing in the hallway when the
word went out that the blue box we depend on so much was setting type once
again.

The worst part of this crisis was that it was caused by a simple exposed
piece of wire and a lack of communication. The best part was learning the en-
durrrnec til a group of very dedicated people.

It i started a list of the people that rescued this newspaper iii the past couple
weeks. we'd need to add four more pages. i do want to thank all the ASPics
from Volume ilell. and all the other very special. understanding folks.

Thanks. '
