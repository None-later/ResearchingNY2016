State Wins Round

in Bout with ' 
Oil Companies

ALBANY; N.Y. (AP) State of-
ficials are claiming victory In the
latest round of a continuing legal
battle to make oil companies pay a
tax while not passing on the cost to
consumers at the gas pumps. '
Thc U.S. Supreme Court refused
Monday to become involved in legal
arguments over tltc so-callcd “pass-

-through" provision of New York’s

controversial 2 percent tax on the
gross receipts of oil companies.
And the court sent the case back to
a lower court for further considera-
tion in light of the expiration of
federal petroleum price controls last
fall.

State officials now predict that
oil companies will eventually be
forch by the lower court to pay the
tax without passing on the extra
cost to consumers.

In .lnnc IBXO, iii an effort to ﬁnd
how rcvcnncs for mass trztnsit
opcr'trtions, lhc \lillL‘ LL‘glhltlllltc irn—
