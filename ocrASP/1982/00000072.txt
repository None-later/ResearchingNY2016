Playing with a very limited roster.
the Albany State junior varsity
basketball team lost twice this
weekend in two very close contests
that were both decided in the final

The Danes played without the

Swim Teams K 0 Middlebury in. a Co-ed,Mﬁ‘eét 

By MICHAEL CARMEN

Bonowitz, Ullman, Zybala, Keil-
ty, Fitzpatrick, Melkleham. These
are far from household names, but
they did assist the Albany Women
and Men's swimming teams to a co-
ed victory over Middlebury College.

The men won rather handily as
they recorded a 82-26 triumph. The
women chose a harder, more ex-
citing rate barely swimming past
their opponent 71-69.

Dulce Ferdandez’s ladies had a
smell of revenge in their match.
Last year they lost badly to Mid-
dlebury and hoped to even the
score. After the first four events the
Danes were behind 20-5.

"We had them where we
wanted," said Fernandez.

They finally got on track in the
loo-yard freestyle. Susan Keilty and
Sheila Fitzpatrick posted a one-two
finish. respectively, Keilty clocked

      

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS Sports FEBRUARYfZTt. 1982; . .

in at 58.8 and Fitzpatrick recorded
a personal low of 59.08.

The Danes gained back more
points in the 50 yard breaststroke.
Carol Lim touched in with a 36.5
time and Lauriann Baines placed se-
cond at 36.5.

In the diving events the women
placed second and third in both the
one meter required and optional
dives. Joan Meikleham garnered sc-
cond in the required while Lynn
Ranney achieved silver in the op-
tional event.

At the half, the women were
behind 41-29. Between the two
halves the senior women swimmers
were honored by Fernandez ‘with
each swimmer receiving a rose for
each year of competition. Six Danes
will be graduating this year: Keilty,
Barb Stachowiak. Barb Van Slyke.
Mcikleham, and Judy Koltai.

“Site only swam this year. I
recruited her from my intermediate

 

class. Koltal is our only four year
swimmer and co-captain of the
team." added Fernandez.

This honoring, perhaps unex-
pectedly gave the Danes the added
boost they needed.

In the 50 yard freestyle, Keilty set i
a new record en route to a first 1
place ﬁnish. Her time was 26.78. 

Fitzpatrick followed right behind
recording a second place ﬁnish and
a 27.2A time.

Keilty was not through however,
and when she completed the 200
yard freestyle, two events later.
Keilty had another record. The
Dane swimmer, who holds seven
other records, swam the event in
1:07.24.

Fitzpatrick, not wanting to be
outdone. also nailed a record in the
200 yard backstroke. Her 2:07.13
time was also good enough for
another Dane ﬁrst.

Despite these victories the women
found themselves trailing 69-64.
This left them with a must win
situation situation in the 200 yard
freestyle relay.

“The firls were crazy and very
psyched up. For many this was their
last home event and for otlters their
last competition." said the Coach.

The women garnered everything
they had left and the team of Ann
I-loch, Keilty. Lim and Fitzpatrick

[A November NIT

There was a day in college basketball. back thirty years or so, when
the most prestigious post-season tournament In America was the NIT,
and not the NCAA. As the years have unfolded. however, the NCAA
has become a month-long spectacle of enormous proportions. The
NIT. though still a ﬁne tournament. has acquired the stigma of being
for losers, for those teams not good enough for the NCAA. With this
in mind, my friend Chris and I set about to ﬁnd a way to rescue the
NIT from obscurity.

The beginning of the college basketball season always provides con-
troversy and discussion as to who are the natio‘n's best teams. There
are prc-season polls all over the place, but no deﬁnitive measure of
who‘s the best. Why not put the NIT in November as a pre-season
tournament? It would certainly gain the sport added media attention
at a time when football is dominating the airwaves. It would Increase
fan interest, as the battle for bragging rights between the various con-
, f erenccs would heat up earlier than usual. The schools involved would
undoubtedly make a lot of money off of this. so it would be good for z
the ﬁnancial state of college athletics as well.

One of the biggest problems involved with such an activity is which
16 teams to invite to this tournament. It would seem that a panel of
basketball experts, ranging from NBA coaches and scouts. to
' newspapcrmen and broadcasters. could vote on which teams are best,
i and the 16 highest schools would go. We feel that such a tournament
would really go a long way, not only towards restoring the luster of the
- NIT. but towards improving the sport of college basketball as a whole.

If you have access to cable television, and any college basketball fan
should, there was a great opportunity last Saturday to see two of,
America‘s most unheralded teams when Fresno State hosted Cal-
Irviae. The Irvine Anteatcrs possess one of the great individual talents
in America in Kevin McGee. Fresno, however. the leading defensive
team in the nation. shut down the powerful Irvine attack, winning,
71-58. Fresno made it to the.NCAAs a year ago. losing a ﬁrst-round
game to Northeastern. They are hoping to get much further this year.
