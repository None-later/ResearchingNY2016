The City of Albany is presently
working with an architectural firm
to design a l,7r)()-ear parking garage
and transportation center itt

downtown Albany.

According to Art Kaplatt,
spokesman for the architectural
firm of liinhorn. Ytlffce, Prescot
and Krouncr, the ttew transporta-
tion center will hopefully alleviate
parking troubles in downtown
Albany. The center will also ltottse
artd service (‘D’I'A buses and serve
as a main bus terminal for the city
and outlying areas, Kaplan strid.

By ROIH‘IlH HUGBI'IIC

State Senate Minority Leader
Manfred ()ltt'eltslcitt. wlto recently
removed himself from consedera-
tiott in the ttpcorning gubernatorial
race. spoke of New York ('ity
Mayor lid Koch‘s candidacy. Presi-
dent Reagan artd the state's
ecottotnic orttlook to nearly 50 peo-
ple gathered iii the Assembly Hall
Tuesday.

Calling the gubernatorial race the
precursor to tile presidential elec-
tions of 1984, 0hrenstein said
Mayor Koch is .“a fast traitt
a-coming.”

Koch cart be the individual who
will articulate the difference bet—
ween responsible economic refortn
and the ideological reform of tlte
right. 0hrenstein said.

However. 0hrenstein. a
Democrat from Brooklyn. wortld
not state whether he would support
Koch or Lentenant Governor Mario
Cuomo in the primaries. He also
questioned whether Koch would
rttn as a Democrat; in last year's
mayoral election Koch won the sup—
port of both the Democratic attd
Republican party litres.

0hrenstein also felt the
Democrats need to organize before
tltc elections which. he said. will be
a jumping-off poittt for national
debate on priorities.

The Democratic Party had been
instrumental in reviving the state's
economy tttttil Reagan's economic
plan was launched, 0hrenstein
claimed.

The President's defense and
economic policies are a challenge to
political institutions and to tire
Democratic Party. said 0hrenstein.
llowetct. he feels Rcaganomics will
fail if it does ttot address itself to
the basic agcttda of social needs.

ltt contrast, 0hrenstein said the
Democratic Party is confident it
“ill win itt the I982 elections.

Krouner has estimated the cost of
the project at $25 tnitnon with a
planned completion date in late
1984 or early 1985.

The site proposed for the center
covers three acres of land between
Broadway and Green Street which
is now 80-90 percent vacant. Kaplan
said. addittg that there are only two
active businesses itt that area which
may be relocated in the ttew center.

Adirondack ‘ 'l‘t'ailways is
negotiating for use of the facility
either in addition to or as a replace-
tnettt of their existing location.
