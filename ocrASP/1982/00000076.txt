it had to happen sooner or later:
the newest program of Manhattan
Cable TV is "The Commercial
Show"--a weekly offering of
nothing but old TV commercials.
How do they support that kind of
program? Advertisers buy time to
place their new commercials bet-
ween the old ones.

Delays in bringing new drugs to
the market are the fault ofthe phar-
maceutical industry, not the federal
regulatory process. so says a newly-

' released congressional study. which

poo-poohs industry claims that
lengthy fcdcral reviews of new pro-
ducts discourage the development

 

of innovative drugs. Drug manufac~
tuttrs clttim bureaucratic red tape
cart wuslc most of the 17-year pu-
tcrrt lives of their products. Not so,
says Iltc study. which blames the
tIL'ltiy on lit/.incss by drug companies
who fail to begin Iltc_govcrnnrcnt
review process soon after getting
product ptttcnts. Thc stttdy could be
it key factor in a bill before Cort-
grcss that would extend ptttcnts by
up to scvcn years.
