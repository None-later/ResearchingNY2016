mouth. it's only a few days since hls_buii-sucklng visit with Erastus iii. and now the Playboy
interview comes out with more off-the-koch comments that have hlzzoner in big trouble. He
Eam apologise till he's blue in the face (which i've only seen 1 person do). but i doubt that
he'll overcome the weight of such remarks as. “Out In the country?...Wben you have to
drive 20 miles to buy a gingham dress or a Sears Roebuck suit?"

Giving the mayor credit. that is a great line. Not as great as his subsequent labelling of Cl-
ty Council President.Caroi Bellamy a "pain in the ass." (which is a fun thing to label
anybody. though not nearly as fun as calling them a "horror Show." which Koch did
Bellamy in December). but good stuff none-ihe-lessu

But great lines don't make for great governors; at least in the eyes of the upstate voters
whom Koch says he didn't think he made fun of. “Yaah.” says Harry Callahan at times like
this. just before he removes some low-life's hairline with a pocket sized rocket launcher. i
suppose such a fate would be harsh for Koch's transgressions. though not according to the
people 1 reached today by phone. When asked. “Do you think we should remove lid
Koch's hairline with a,rocket launcher?" many people did say yes. Be advised that this was a
highly unscientific poll. though i tlrltrk it does accurately gauge some voter feeling in rura
New York.

Koch is hoping this all blows over by the time November and the election roll around. go
lng as far as saying that he was particularly pleased that “the interview comes out iil
February instead of October. for obvious reasons." ‘

That's where Ed is wrong. These remarks will continue to haunt him all through the spr-
ing and the i: ng hot summer. at least itr the pages of Aspects. where we will print excerpts
from the interviews until Election Day. Here's the first installment:

stress: an
Equal
But
Separate

Apparently it's time to rethink feminism.

Betty Friedan has always been a pioneer
in the modern women's movement; her
first book Feminine Mystique broke the
sexist ice in the '60's. Now she's out with
another book. Second Stage. which
amounts to a re-evaluatlon of feminism
and its goals.

Apparently the women who have
successfully liberated themselves. perhaps
balancing a prosperous career with family
life, are now asking “Where do we go from
here?" After their personal battle for
equality is over, they seem to be lacking
direction and the promised contentment
Just isn't there. .The superficial skirmishes
are over — they‘ve got their own labs and
light their own ciga‘rettes —- but something
ls amiss: the sexless utopia has not
descended on the US. oi A. Perhaps a
questioning of the fundamental premises of
feminism is in order.

The most basic tenet of feminism is that
women are "equal" to men. But what does
"equal" mean? Does a phrase such as “All
men are created equal" imply that all ltave
the same talents and attributes in equal
proprotions? No. rather that all have the
same intrinsic value as far as some idea of
basic human worth. Equality does not
mean sameness. Men and Women may be
“equal.” but they are not the same.

Perhaps the greatest albatross facing
radical feminists is that they cannot deny
the physical differences between sexes.
namely because they're staring them right
fit the face. And if there are genetic
pl ysical differences, why is it sexist to say
there may he genetic inertial and emotional
differences? Studies have demonstrated.
for example. differences between sexes in
mental perception of 3—dimensional figures
and in stress capabilities. this leads to the
old question of environment vs. heredity.
Some feminists would say that the
environment of our sexist society is
responsible for these differences. Some
might even claim that the physical stature
of women is a result of their oppressive
exclusion from manual labor.

But there is a natural necessity for
physical differences; melt and women must
complement each other physically for the
reproduction of the species. The male
makes his contribution and the female hers
and together the whole is established. The
woman is physically equipped for the
nurturing of children. the male better suited
(at least in an agricultural society) for
hewing sustenance out of the earth. Only
through this partnership ltas humanity been
able to flourish.

And if the sexes naturally complement
each other physically. Why is it unnatural
for them to complement mentalpand
emotionally? Each sex has different natural
functions — in all facets of life — which
complement each other to form a balanced
society. Not unequal. )ust different.

The real proof of this sexual diversity
comes as women naturally gravitate
towards the roles their sex suits them best
tor. Most women who profess feminism
seem to abandon many of its sexless ideals
when it comes to their personal life and
“Mr, Right." The perpetual. radical feminist

alone is willing to spite her 0th nature -
motivated usually be bitterness and hatred
of men,

This leads to perhaps the principal cause
of feminism: the failure of men. It's an age
when men are becoming increasingly

'ByTaur'a muck/Ups

.further proof that the two sexes are
.inextrlcably linked and complementary in
nature. the solution is not the triumph of
51 percent of the human race through
lfemlnism. but rather a treatment for the
lself-centeredness of te human soul. But

 

' that's another story.

A reading of the literature of past
cultures will show that feminism is not a
modern phenomenon. but rather a
recurrent human experience. Each time it
pops up. however. It falls to take hold due
to the overriding influence of natural
human tendency. Feminism is not a revolt
'against tradition. but part of tradition itself.
And as Betty Frledan bears Witness.
rwomen are not yet abandoning their
natures. and the corrective process has
begun once again.i:l
