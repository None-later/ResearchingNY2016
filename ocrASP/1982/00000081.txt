“peasants fighting for liberty." We would
be interested in your definitions of
“pcasantsf’ and "liberty."

The traditional connotation of thc lctm
"peasant" conjures up visions of a poor
farm laborer. unconcerned with political
power struggles. This can certainly be con-

trasted with the Soviet attd Cuban supplied -

anti-government forccs wc sec in til
Salvador. Are wc to belicvc that tltcsc
jungle fighters go homc at night after a
long. hard day of gttcrrilla warfarc to till
their soil and tend to their cows“!

We would also likc to inqttirc as to your
definition of liberty. (‘an wc trttly bclicvc
that true lihctty will hc \vitncsscd if the
Salvadoran t'cbcls takc control of tltc rcigns

'I‘o tilt: I'ldltnr:

If only 1 had listcncd to my fricntls.
Despitc what tny friends had told the about
the labyrinth SUNYA burcaucracy, l
tltottghl that I would have no Irottblc at our
well rttn institution whcn | planncd to get
off tltc UAS mcal plan.

In mid-January. while the univcrsity had
a recess. 1 called Stttdcttl Accounts (aftcr
having bcctt rcfcrrgd to two othcr depart-
tncttts) and was told that as lottg as 1
presented tny tttcal (dining) card as soon as l
cottld iii the Spring. scmcstcr. thcrc should
be no problem in getting a quick rcfund on
my bill.

I arrived in Albany on Sttnday. January
24, about 11 p.m. and went straight to tltc
Food Services office at 9 a.m. on lvlonday.
The aide lhcrc was friendly bttt said that 11c
could not help tnc. another man would have
to do that. That tttan askcd mc wlty I had
not seen him cariicr lltcn askcd Inc to provc
that I had gotch incorrch information attd
that I had not arrived in Albany till tltc
night bcforc. Aftcr my cxplanaliun, ltc
stated that hc could ttol help me. that I
should pay $24 to stay on the meal plan for
another week and lhcn notify ltis ol'l'icc that
l was getting off meal plan on the following
Friday. With grcat pumposity. he told me
that‘s what he could do for mu. thn i ask—
ed whcn I would be refunded for the Spring
semester hc told me in four to six weeks.

Friday afternoon I dropped out of the
meal plan (rcccivcd no receipt for the tran-
saction) but was told that my rcfttnd would
not reach me for another six to ten weeks.
They gave no explanation for the delay.

one week later. I asked an assistant at the
Billing Department of thc ilursar‘s Office if
they had rcccivcd noticc of my change.
"No." she said. “notices from Food Scr-
vicc reach us in dribs and drabs; takes
about a wcck or so to get from Food Service
to Billing." Where would the paperwork go
to then? It would take her department ﬁve
weeks or more to process it. then another
week or two at the Collections Dcpartmcnt
before my refund would be sent to me. at
my permanent address. After quitting the
meal plan In January. I may not be refund-

  
  
  

cd till April.

This nonsensc lcavcs no reasonable ex-
cuse. however. it is explained away. I may
accept less than efficient scrvicc. but this is
intolerable. i would appreciate a rcsponsc
to my letter by representatich of depart-
ments I have mentioned.

Not in The Spirit

 

To the Editor:

On Thursday. Feb. 18. an‘intctttalionnl
fair was bold iii the lccturc ccntcts as onc of
the events plantth for World chk. ()tt :1
wholc. the participants dcscrvc cotntucntla-
tion on capturing tltc spirit of thc occassion
with thcir dcliciotts food. music. and
cultural information.

There was ottc obvious csccption to this
general spirit and that was the Arab
sludcnts‘ tablc which had pamphch aflcr
pamphch of anti-lsracl propaganda. Thcsc
included “Israeli Military Build Up."
“lsracli Aggression against Iraq's Nuclear
Installation." “Zionism and Racism." and
a book entitled. “Israel and Torture."

lnvmy eyes. the purpose ofthc fair was to
give people a glimpse of a variety of
cultures and to bring the various groups
together in a friendly gathering. The Arab
tablc used it as a political event to gain sup-
port for their causc and anxiously gave out
their pamphlets to passcrs-by — many of
whom were visiting junior high and high
School students possibly having their first
exposure to the Israeli-Arab conﬂict.

At'tcr enjoying the other tables. t walked
away feeling upset and frustrated by this

’ out of place. hostile display. I hope that

next year. the Arab group will participate in
the proper spirit and open students up to
their rich and interesting Culture.
