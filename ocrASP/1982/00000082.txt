ALBANY STUDENT PRESS, FEBRUARY 26, 1982

Jeff Fromm ‘

comforter/from page three
tninut‘ion to fill the void created by
Woddy Popper's resignation. In Iny
freshman year ! was clcctcd to the
position of' Director of Public Rela-
tions on dutch Quad Executive
Board. My responsibilities in that
office were to maintain opcn lirtcs
ol‘ communication with thc other
Quad ABoards, to coordinate all
advertising campaigns for DOB.
and to serve as editor of the DO
newsletter.

This year. as an elected Ccnlrttl
(‘ouncil rcprcscnitnivc from Dutch
Quad. ! was appointed co-clmirmnn
ol‘ the Student Services comniittcc
of‘ SA. This commitlcc rcscurchcs
and develops spccittl projccts to
hcnct'it thc student community.
Among thc projects sicrnming from
this commiticc arc thc SA Used
Book Manual. a laundry room for
oil-campus studcnis, lhc “What's
Your Beef?" suggcstion-complaint
campaign, and an icc-rollcr skating
rink on campus. In addition, ! have
remained an active mcmbcr ol'
DQB, serving as chairman ol' the
Constitution committcc.

I Inc! my cxpcricncc is extensive,
and. coupled with hard work and
determination. I can make the tran-
siiion into the office of vice presi-
dcnt successfully. it is my opinion
that the vice president's job is two-
I'old. His primary obligation is to be
responsible for thc day-to-duy
management ol' the SA ol‘l‘iccs. But
it is also his duty to initiate and
supervise special projccts allowing
for thc smoother running el' SA in
future years.

One major goal of the organiz-
tion this year is to develop a closely
budgctcd account of opcrating cx-
pcnscs. In the past this hudch line
has served as an open-ended calcit-
nll fund for any costs incurred. Ol-
I'icc staff', photocopying, and con-
vcniions arc among tltc many types.
of' expenditures from this line. A
tighlcr rcin on SAX. butlch would
pinc the way for morc cl'l'icicnl
opcrnlion. My knowlcdgc oI' Ihc in-
ternal working,» of SA will cnnhlc
me to ltclp I‘urihcr our cl'l'orls
toward this gonl.

Throughout this slatcmcnt I hnvc
bccn discussing it I'nmilim ubhrcviu—
lion: “SA”. What is ol‘tcn lost in
this abbreviation is the I'Lth llnti
“SA” stands for “Studcnt Associa-
tion,“ nttmcly an association of
students. My lonc-rangc goat! l'or
this studcnt hotly is to nntkc it both
morc 'rcprcwittntivc ol' studcni's
viewpoints and morc understanding
of studcnt's nccds. During my ncxt
two yL‘tlth oI' involvcincnt in SA I
hopc to accomplish this goal.
