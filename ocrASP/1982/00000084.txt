! BUFFALO, N.Y (AP)What does
Wayne Gretzky do for an encore?
l “i'm only worrying about No. 80.
then going from there." said the 2|
year old Edmonton Oilers' super
scorer after he got Nos. 77. 78 and
79 Wednesday night in a 6-3 victory
over the Buffalo Sabres.

Gretzky’s three goals came in the
final 6:36 of the game. His first of
i the night —— on a l0-foot wrist shot

that went under Sabres goalie Don
Edwards ~ gave him the only ma-
jor National Hockey League offen-
sive record. he did not hold: most
goals in one season.

"One hundred is still 2l away so
there's no use thinking about it."

But at his current pace -— he
scored the 79 goals in 64 games. i4
fewer than it took Phil Esposito to
set the old mark of 76 in 1970-71 —
he would get 98 goals. And. with
l76 points, i2 more lhart the NHL
mark be established last season.
Gretzky appears headed fer a 220

point campaign.

“i’m sure someday somebody
will break my records." said Gret-
zky. who could make it awfully dif-
ficult simply by continuing his play
of the last four games. in which he
has scored five points apiece. “I've
been very fortunate so far so early
in my career. When i broke it at 18
or 19. I listened to the older guys
who had been there. That's helped
me a lot."

Esposilo was asked ltow far he
thought Gretzky could go. “Oh. 95
goals or something." he said. “And
200 points is a cinch."

I‘The sky is the limit." said Oilers
owner Peter l’ocklington. with
whom Gretzky has a contract
lasting until the end of the century.

“He is the superstar's superstar.
If he stays healthy. I see no reason
Why‘he can't get l00 goals and 125
every year." Gretzky.
however. said he prefers to concen-
trate on the team's achievements.

And the Oilers are having a
phenomenal season. '

“The most important part is the
team." he said after scoring at least
one point in his 20th successive
game. “Over the last three seasons.
we have improved so muelt as a
team and you can look at the in-
dividual statistics. Most of the
players have improved their scor-
ing.

"We want to end up with the best
overall record in the leagrre and
then. the ultimate for any ltockey
player. is to win the Stanley Cup.
We have a lot of heart in our play.
everyone is team-oriented. Hopefu-
ly. we cart keep improving as a team
and. if we play as well next year. 1'“
have a elrartcc for rrtorc records."

His latest record brotlghl
messages of congratulations from
U.S. President Ruttald Reagan and
NHL President .lohn Ziegler.

Women’s Basketball Ends-'Well' V

The Albany women‘s basketball
team finished last year's season with
a 7-l3 record. Before Wednesday
night‘s game against Russell Sage.
tlteir record for this season stood at
7-12. The Dane‘s needed a win to
better last year's mark:-

With only minutes left in the

 

game. Albany cleared a point lead.
A Rttssell Sage player made a
desperation shot just before the
buzzer—every breath was held until
the ball bounced hnrtnlessly off the
rim. Albany maintained their 66-65
wilt.

The team was behind most of the

 

(i

game. Corning irt at the beginning
of the second half they were down
Ill-42. At one point Albany attained
a five point lead. but quickly lost it
witlt nuntcrous violations and tur-
norcrs.
