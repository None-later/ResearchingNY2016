Newman Favors Electric Shock

 

 

Pain Punishes Criminal Behavior

By DEBBIE JUDGE

 

“I don't want to muck around
with people's brains. All I wattt to
do is administer some intense
pain," said Graeme Newman. pro-
fessor and Associate Dean of
Criminal Justice at SUNYA.

"After the initial shock." said
Newntan. discussing public accep-
tance of his theory of corporal
punishment. "people usually think
about it and say. ‘wcll. maybe it's
not a bad idea after all."’

Newman’s theory. which ad-
vocates severe corporal punishment
for criminals. electric shocks in par-
tictrlar. has been put forward in his
book. Just and Painful Punish-
ment. to be published soon.

Last week. as part of the “Thurs-
day Topics” talks offered by the
State museum. Newman's

40-minute speech revolved around
ltis theory of resurrectirrg corporal
punishment as an alternative to the
“ctrrrent one-track obsession with
prison."

Electric sltock. Newman said. is
especially adaptable in that it has ll
dimensions of flexibility —— that of
increasing voltage. duration bet-
ween shocks. and length of the
shock itself. I‘If the only flexibility
rt had was to increase the volts.
there would be severe limitations
. . . you couldn't go too far before
you do lasting damage or maybe
killed the person.”

Newman embraced the age-old
idea of corporal ptrnisltrncnt as a
pltysical reprimand that is not only
“intensely painful" bttt “swift and
certain. which can be gotten over
quickly." This way. the offender
can be allowed to return to society.

unlike. Ncwntatt said. the situation
created by prisons. And although
similar. his theory also varies from
ancient practices. “Of course the
old punishments that l atu against
are the other kinds of corporal
punishments which have lasting ef-
fects. srtclt as ctrttittg off ltands.
branding. cutting off ears . . ." As
Newtrtatt pointed ottt in Itis talk. a
mart without a hattd cannot return
to u ttormal life.

“They” (maiming punishments)
he said. “were expressive of the
social conditions of the time."

Newman points to the long list of
pathetic failures of alternatives to
prison that have been tried. These
were the ideas of the liberal
penalogists of the 1950's. “whose
basic premise is that criminals are
not bad. they‘re sick and therefore
they should be treated and
rehabilitated. and so on. Most of
the research in the last 20-30 years
has demonstrated that none of this
works." lte said.

Homosexuals Lose Senate Vote

 

Discriminatory

By LIZ REICH

 

in a stinging defeat to Gay and
Lesbian forces, the University
Senate narrowly defeated a motion
yesterday which would phase ottt
the ROTC program on campus
because of its discriminating policy
towards homosexuals.

The ttrotiott was defeated by a
tttcre two votes (25-27) after at
tensiou»fi|led discussion among
professors and students over the
presence of ROTC on campus.

Wltile homosexuals are not
prevented front taking tlte ROTC
classes. they are prevented front
receiving scholarships and becomc~
ittg officers.

Sttrdcnt Senator Erie Koli said
“According to Affirmative Action
Acting Director Gloria DeSole if
ROTC treated blacks the same way
it treated gays and lesbians theyl
wouldn't be allowed on campus."

The defeated motion was propos-
ed by studcttt Senator Jim Tierney
as a substitute for an Executive

Policy Prevails

Committee motion. The original
motion insured. “full access for
students to tire courses offered on
this campus by RPI’s ROTC pro-
gram."

Although any student cart enroll

in an ROTC class Tierney contends.
“The only reason for taking a
course is to becorttc an officer and
students are denied entrance to
ROTC fortttal commissioning pro-
grams for homosexual and bisexual
nrcfercnees.“
However. a student iii the ROTC
program felt differently. Brandon
Fletcher said. “It is an army policy
to discriminate against homosex-
uals. not art ROTC policy. It's not
right to treat us as'an extension of
army policy."

Student Senator Mark chritt
disagreed. “Tlte U.S. army
discriminates against homosexuals.
ROTC is part of the U.S. army."
Fletcher also added, “We
feel it is our right to be on this earn-
pus."

However. Mark Salisch of the
College of Continuing Studies said.

Wunlx In urlutinixler some pain

So Newman unfolded his idea.
of the “rediscovery, or moderniza-
tion. really. of some of the old
kinds of punishment." Moderniza-
tion is key in his advocation of elec-
trical shock as a punishment. “it is
more modern atrd scietttifie. tnore
easily administered and calibrated
and probably there are tnore
chances of confining the pain to a
specific part (of the body) artd mak-
ing sure it is non-lasting."

Would this tnetltod. however. be
effective? Newman cites limited
laboratory rcscarclt. done mostly
on animals. which shows electrical
sltock to be “very. very effective in
suppressing unwanted behavior."

However. he also points out that
deterrence is not the aim of cor»
poral punishment. the idea is not to
make people obedient; there are no
signs of Clockwork Orange.
Newman drew a line between his
idea of shocks and those used in
psychological treatment which is
applied specifically to the brain.

"People are punished because
their crimes deserve punishment. In
an open society you have to
recognize the right of individtrals to
break the law  On the other
hand." Ite continued. “those who
are recognized as having the right to
break the law ltavc to recognize our
'ight to punish them."
