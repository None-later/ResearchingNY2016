don't make your mark

It’s almost an invitation to the el-
ty's canvas-hungry graffiti artists:
the New York Transit Authority
has painted tire ten cars of its 42nd
Street sltnttle solid white. Ap-
parently Mayor Ed Koch ltas faith
in the Big Apple‘s new $l00,000
anti-graffiti ad campaign. designed
to shame the spray paint crowd into
cleaning up their act. Sports figures
ttttd celebrities will appear in radio.
TV, arid billboard ads. using the
slogan “Make your mark irt society.
not on society." .Ittsl in case the
moral persuasion doesn't work. the
city is also using attack dogs and
tarot-edge fences to protect its
white trtrirrs when they're not itt use.

that in a male-tomale conversa-
tion. the smile generally wards off
interruption. bttt a woman's smile
invites interruption by a male
because men interpret a smile by a
woman as a sign of submission. For
example. says Professor Carl
Camden. he and his partner noticed
doctors frequently batted in when
smiling nurses were talking. As for
a solution. Camden frowns on the
idea of womcrt trying to keep a
straight face. and advises men in-
stead to wise up. “Why should 52
percent of the population have to
change so that the 48 percent
minority doesn‘t have to feel un-
comfortable."

With a storeowner‘s permission. the
