five schools in the top twenty.

Six Danes qualified for the event ‘

and each one contributed points to
Albany‘s effort. “There was a lot to
be happy about. We weri: pretty
much able to justify our tenth place
national ranking (received after the
SUNYACs),“‘cxplained squad cap-
taln Vic Herman.

The Dane recipients of the
powerful All—American recognition
were Andy Scras. Dave Averill. and
Spcro Thcol'ilatos. In order to
receive strclr status a wrestler must
place amongst lltc top eight in his
weight class of 32 participants.

Scras. ruttnhcr four out ot‘llic lSl)

tirnr.‘ SUNYAC champ \\‘lt\ edged»
out by Ron Bril‘l'cy. III-ll, Dehleo
explained the match as “one of the
worst refereed matches l ever saw."

"You have to beat three people
in a wrestling match—yourself. the
opponent, and tile referee. Andy
kept his head and battled like hell.
He tried to keep the calls from
bothering hint. and that was wiry
the match was so close." noted
DeMcl).

Seras, a sophomore commented
on his tough break: “I am definite-
ly satisfied that I got my minimum
goal (of becoming a two time All-
American), but I didn't get what I
really wanted—the championship."

Averill. who brought home a
seventh place in the 118 weiglll class

was somewhat happier with his
results. After becoming Albany's
second freshman All-American
wrestler (Seras was the first). Averill
claimed. “I did the best that I
could." ()n his way up to seventh
place, the Hit porrrldcr was only to
be defeated by the eventual second
arid fifth place winners.

In addition to gaining the All»
American status the freshman came
away with sortie crucial experience.
“I was really scared of going into a
tournament with so much talent.
llrrl when I just got in there and
wrestled. l r'elrli/cd that these guys
were no better than we are." corn-
rncnted Averill.

L'ozrch DcMeo agreed that a great
deal can be learned from a NCAA
lcvel trnrr'narncnl. He also affirmed
that “there is it lot rrrorc to be lrcard
from Dave Averill."

Squcaking irrlo tllc eighth spot at
tile l3~l weight level was SliNYAt‘
champion ’l‘lrcol‘ilrrlos, After “war-
tiring up" witlr an h‘»2 win over
Ryan l~‘ov in the first round. the
junior had to lace lop seeded Steve
l‘crlrtlllllc/ in tllc second bout. The
eventual winner at lJAl pounds was
too much for 'l'hcofilatos to handle.
as the Dane defaulted mid-way
through tllc match.

The victory assured the junior of

ultimate goal. Albany's remaining
llrrce qualifiers cacll recorded at
lcal orlc victory.

In his last season with the team.
Warren Wray "made a contribu-
tion just like he did all year." said
DcMeo.

Tire senior"s contribution this
past weekctrd was an ll-0 win over
Bob 'l'hamc. as well as another large
dose of his perennial learn spirit.
f‘We had a really successful team
effort, arid that has special meaning
to me.“ commented Witty.

“I‘m proud of him—ll is sad that
he‘s lcavirtg. Warren had a positive
effect on the learn ill the entire time

Iid Gleason also had an im-
pressive start. upsetting the fifllr
seeded wrestler. Kirk Benson. 9-6.
Nevertheless. that would be as far
as the determined sophomore
would go. After tearing it carllidgc
in his knee at lllc end of his first
match, Gleason crtcountered too
much pain to be effective arty
longer. I

"I feel that I would have been an
All-American il' I didn‘t get
hurl.“said Gleason. The 150
pounch was not alone itl his opi~
nion. “He was not in awe of the
competition. and having the correct
mental aspect is so important ill the
sport." commented DcMco.

Herman. captain of the Dane
squad. ran up against trouble early.
A 9~6 loss against a second seed Tim
Casmin put the Albany

heavyweight in it rough predica-
merrl. In order to receive All-
American status he would have to
defeat his next two competitors.
Tire junior was able to convincingly
beat his first challenger l5—3. btrt
