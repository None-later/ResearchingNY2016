Danes ECAC—Bound After Losing in SUNYACs
Passed Over by the NCAA After Being
Upset by Buffalo and Buffalo State

By LARRY KAHN

BUFFALO — Going into the
SUNY Conference tournament this
weekend, the Albany Great Danes
had high hopes for a repeat of last
year's championship performance.

At 17-7 the Danes pOSSessed the
best record of the four contenders.
and they were riding high off a big
win over Oswego. the team with the
best overall record in the West divi-
sion, despite not qualifying for the
tourney. They definitely had
momentum.

But Albany displayed their inex—
pericnced side in the tournament. in
their first two truly “pressure”
games of the season, the Danes
played themselves out of the NCAA
playoff picture. They lost to the
Buffalo Bul|s(13-15) in the first
round. 53-51. and then to the Buf-
falo State Benga|s(15-12)in the con-
solatioti game. 72-68.

Buffalo continued to roll with an
82-70 upset victory over the defen-
ding national champion Potsdam
Bears(16-9) to take the SUNYAC
crown.

The triumph earned the Bulls the
right to compete in the NCAA East
Regional this weekend at Staten

island. Potsdam received an at-
largc bid to the Northeast Regional.
but, for the ﬁrst time in four years.
the NCAA selection committee
passed over the Danes.

Albany has been invited to com-
pete in the ECAC Upstate New
York tournament in Hamilton this
weekend where they will meet
Oswego (16-9) in the opening round
on Saturday. The winner will meet
the winner of the Hamilton-Elmira
game. Hamilton(20-4) is currently
ranked twelfth in the nation in Divi-

Outside the friendly walls of
University Gym. Albany has not
been a good team this year. The
Danes are 5-8 on the road and have
won only one of four tournaments
they have played in—the Great
Dane Classic, which they hosted in
Dccember(and defeated Buffalo
55-48 in the ﬁnals).

But in Buffalo this weekend the I

Danes knew what they had to do.
They knew they had to win at least
one game to make the NCAAs. To
win they knew outside shooting
would be the key.

Against the Bulls, though, the
Danes shot a meager 39.7 percent
from the floor, and against the
Bengals that figure dropped to 37.1
percent.

“We did not shoot well." said
Albany basketball coach Dick
Sauers. "Our good perimeter
shooters just did not shoot well."

in sharp contrast, both of the
Danes' opponents were successful
on over 50 percent of their shots.

The opening game was a close.
hard-fought contest that was mark-
ed by controversy. Albany was
ahead of the Bulls 23-22 at the half.
after leading by as much as six.

in the second halfthings began to
heat up. The lead changed hands on
eight consecutive baskets.

But. more significant. each squad
lost its top guard when they were
ejected for flagrant personal fouls
with 16:24 left in the game. The
Bulls’ Karon Henderson opened the
card with a vicious elbow to Dan
Croutier’s face. Croutier reacted to
the blow and countered with a left
cross to Henderson‘s jaw. The
referees knocked them both out of
the game—fit was the second time

Henderson was ejected this year.
At that point. the game turned.

“it was tough for us to play without

half our offense." explained

Sauers. “He makes things happen

out there."

“Our game changed tremendous-

ly when Henderson .got thrown out
of the game," said Bttffalo coach '
Bill Hughes. “After that i thought
we were in very deep trouble." '

They weren't. The Danes were.
Albany had only two semi-
cxpcricnced guards left. Dave
Adam did a great job filling in for
Croutier. scoring 12 points. but it
wasn't enough.

The Bulls quickly pulled out in
front and led 37-31 with 11:24 to go
and 48-41 with 5:28 showing on the
clock.

 

The Danes fought back. They
scored four straight points. and
creeped to within one on Adam's
driving layup at 51-50 with 2:20 left.

Gatto fouled Bulls‘ star John
Fitzpatrick. who sank his eighth
straight free throw. to swing the
lead back to Buffalo. The Danes
looked for a good shot against the
Bull zone defense, but Gatto's long
baseline jumper came tip short at

:15.

The Bulls tried to stall and Gattc
fouled George Cicary, a little used
reserve. in the backcourt. Cleary
missed the front end of a one-and-
one. With 11 seconds on the clock.
Fitzpatrick fouled Adam. The
freshman stepped to the line to
shoot the one-and—onc. needing one
point to knot the game. His first
shot hounded off the front of the
rim.

l’ive seconds later Buffalo guard
Kevin McMillan dropped in one of
two free throws to extend their ad-
vantage to two. 53-51.

Albany quickly called timeout.

John Dicckehnan was supposed
to take the inbounds pass and feed
it to Adam. the team’s fastest
player and a good outside shooter.
But when Dicckelman got the ball
he turned the wrong way and had to
take the ball upcourt himself. His
shot just before the buzzer bounced
harmlessly off the rim.

“He made the best play that he

could. but it took a lot longer."
noted Sauers.

in that game Albany's shooting
was not up to par. but on Saturday
against Buffalo State it got worse.
Gatto. normally one of the Danes’
top marksmen. missed 11 of 12‘
shots from the fiodr. many of them
offensive rebounds that he failed to
convert. All told, Albany had 25 of-
fensive rebounds, but “none of
them seemed to go in when we got
them. anyway.” Sauers lamented.

Physical problems also plagued
the Danes. Jan Zadoorian. a star-
ting guard. was‘bothcrcd by a cold
and played only four minutes.
Dieckelman‘s ankle. injured two
weeks ago, was bothering him.

rSurprise Champs Crowned}
Bulls Gore Potsdam, 82- 70

“We're dragging a little bit." said
Sauers. “it's been hard. We've got
the walking wounded out there.”

Albany kept the game close most
of the first half, but trailed the
Bengals 35-30 at the intermission.
But at the start of the second ltalf
Buffalo State started running all
over the Dane defense. They built
up an 11 point margin with 12:25
remaining in the game.

But once again the Danes rallied
back. Croutier and Dennis Pagan
got hot and Albany narrowed the
gap. A Dieckelman tap-in with 2:26
left brought the score to 66-64.

Once again. though. Albany
missed some crucial shots and the

BUFFALO — After all the smoke had cleared on Saturday, the
SUNYAC had crowned a surprise champion. The previously 11-15
University of Buffalo Bulls, seeded fourth in the tournament. defeated
the Potsdam Bears for the conference title and an automatic bid to the
East Regional of the NCAA Division 111 tournament.

"The. team played hard," said UB basketball head coach Bill
Hughes. “it was a big win for us."

The Bulls were led by guard Karon Henderson and forward John
Fitzpatrick. Each chipped in with 27 points in the title game. Hender-
son. ejected from the first game against Albany after fighting with
Dane Dan Croutier, earned all-tournament honors, while Fitzpatrick
was named tournament Most Valuable Player.

Last year’s tournament MVP, John Dicckelman, was Albany's only
representative on the all-tournament squad. Joining Dicckclman on
the all-star team was Buffalo State‘s Terry Burch, who scored 27
points in the consolation game against Albany. and Potsdam's

Maurice Woods.

Woods fouled out of the physical title contest with 6:49 remaining in
the second half. Hughes felt that the Bulls frustrated Potsdam by vary-

ing their defensive formations.

“Our defense was perfect, i thought it hurt them," said Hughes.
lie noted that the Bulls had developed winning character by playing
a long season. including games against several Division 1 and Division

11 opponents.

“We've played a tougher schedule," said Hughes. “We’ve lutng in. i '
k _”l’m proud.” he continued. “and a little surprised." , '

SUNYA ROTC Faces Challenge

 

 
  

By BETH BRINSER

A resolution recommending that

The resolution stated that “Cen-

that “students who have legitimate

not accepting homosexuals for

perpetuating the myth that

“i believe if the University is go-

Saturday Mail Service to
Quads to End in Fall ’82

By BETH IIRINSER

Saturday mail service on all
quads will be rcstlmcd tomorrow
for the rest of the semester, accor—
ding to Physical Plant Dennis
Stevens.

The elimination of Saturday mail
service was in violation of the
Residence ltall contract which
states. “campus mail is delivered
once a day (except Sunday and
Federal holidays) to student
mailboxes in residence halls.

However. there will be no further
Saturday mail service beginning iii
the Fall 1982 semester. according to
Vice President of Finattcc and

Hartigan explained that “the

Hartigan decided to resutnc tnail

Group Demands Bus Fare Decision

By B I'ITH BRINSER

 

Approximately 30 people attend-
ed the public hearing on the
SUNYA Bus System yesterday in
LC 24 demanding that lhc ad-
ministration takc an absolute stand
with the bus fcc issue.

Off Campus Associtilion Direc-
tor Mark Dunlea said "students
need to know this rigln now so they
can decide whether to live on or off
campus next year."

 
 

 

President Vincent O'Lcary. Vice
President of Finance and Business
Jolm llartigan and Physical Plait!
Director Dennis Stevens were sent
notices ol the hearing but did not
attend.

Those attending the hearing
decided to go to O'Lcary's office
since he was not at the hearing.
O’Leary was displeaer with the
lack of courtesy from the group.

“Nobody asked me if i could at-
tend the meeting. 1 was tied up

’ ‘ 'a't'i «3.1- J -' v r u f5 -$ s‘o'é. {uh-(n. Jilin".

already when the hearing was an-
nounced,” said O'Lcary.

Hartigan also had something else
planned when he found out about
the meeting. “But.” he said, I‘l
have no problem at all if students
want to make an appointment with
me. No one bothered to find out if
We wanted to come or if we could."

O‘Leary told the group that he
could not absolutely guarantee it.
but as of this moment there are no
plans to put a fee on the bus.

. “My assumption is if the (State)
budget goes through. then there will
be no bus fee,“ he said. But
everything has to be looked at ifthe
budget is changed.

OCA spokesperson John Wenske
wanted to make sure no fee is im-
posed because “oncc the fee has
been established. it's easy to keep
upping it."

Hartigan sees “the queSIion rais-
ed by a number of students about a
prospective fee as a non-issue."
