‘Qaarters’Playing Hazardous to Health

 

Iowa ’3 Indigestible Epidemic

(CPS) While many. campuses are
coping- with the ravages of the
winter and others desperately try to
concoct ways to mitigate their ﬁscal
crises. the University of lowa is
fighting a different kind of pro
blem: a small epidemic of students
who have to have quarters removed
from their digestive tracts.

Over the last six months. lowa
City’s University hospital has
treated lS-ZO students who had
been playing "Quarters." a drink-
ing game. according to Dr. Robert
Hageman.

The game, Hageman said, con-
sists of “a bunch of people sittinu
around a table drinking beer. and
trying to flip quarters into the
mugs. When someone gets a quarter
into a beer. he can either drink it or
JchOOsc someone else who has to.
The person elected mttst chug the
beer. and catch the quarter in his
teeth."

“Caps.” a variation using bottle

[caps instead of quarters. is also
Jmttkillg rounds of local college
tbars'. according to Dr. Harley
Fcldick. Iowa's director of Health
Services.
QITcIdick reports all increase in iti-
juries relating to other drinking
games among Iowa students during
the last two school years. Some
students have also been hurt playing
a game in which a participant lights
the alcohol in a drink on fire. and
then tries to gulp it down without
getting burned.

60’s vs. 80’s

for example. reports a fed-up stu-
dent telling her, “You guys had all
the easy issues. It‘s harder on us."

"Current students don’t really
understand why there was so much
turmoil then," Penn State‘s Murray
observed. “They're not very sym-
pathetic to their older brothers and
sisters who still ‘haven’t found
themselves.‘ The students now are
deadly serious. There's very little
frivolity. and they're motivated to
get ahead as fast as possible."

.Inek Nachbar, a professor of
popular culture at Bowling Green
State University, added, “The six-
ties idca of sitting around all day
and getting high just makes no
sense to these kids. The confidence
in middle class affluence as a given
just no longer exists."

Because the 19605 and 19805 are
so different politically and
economically. teachers have found
a cynicism among current students
about what their predecessors of the
sixties did and what they left
behind.

“What we have produced," said
Warren Susman, a historian at
Rutgers University, “is a new
generation that is bright. interested
in the past. but with an absolute
belief that nothing they do can
make a difference."

At the same time, Susman added,
“Students sense that (sixties
students) had a culture of their
own. At least the young had their
own experience. Students today
have a bewilderment that the
legends could really be like what
they‘ve heard. They don’t have that
sense of mystery. that sense of
adventure that the sixties students
had."

The professors have an especially
difficult titnc teaching about the
Vietnam war.

Said Stlsman. “This group (of

humility/rage]; _

“We started hearing rumors
about the games, and before long
we were getting students with in-
juries from them." Feldick recall-
ed.

"Quarters" has caused most of
the problems, according to
Hageman.

Many people simply pass the
'quarters. but some — notably
smaller. younger, and female
students —— are physically incapable
of passing them.

Hageman worries that some peo-
ple might start using smaller coins
to make the game safer. but warned
that “a smaller coin would be the
perfect size to lodge in the airway at
the back of the throat. and cause
death in about 20 seconds."

Neither Hagcman nor Feldick
would speculate on possible reasons
for the increase in the game playing,
or in the injuries frotn iI.

Hospital spokesman Dean Borg.
however. noted, “I asked my sort
who is in high school about this.
and lie said ‘that’s nothing new.
and it isn't limited to lowa‘."

 

 

SI/NYA Swallows With Pride

By JANET HOOD

The Student Health Service has
been greatly concerned on this cam»
pus about the game, “.caps." or
“Quarters.” Unfortunately we
have had several experiences with it
here at SUNYA. In one instance a
crinkle-edge bottle cap was
swallowed, requiring a surgeon‘s
monitoring with radiolbgic ex-

posure. which cost a
lot of money. in 
Column

another instance a
quarter was vomited
up by a patient after

-morc than a week's retention in the

stomach. There have been other
cascs.

Our greatest fear is that since peo-
ple engaging in this risky behavior
are likely to be sloshcd to start with.

 

lint it hasn't spread through llu,
state yet. however. “We have had
no students collie in with injuries
related to any of those games."
reported Dr. Ll. litumun of Iowa
State’s Strident Health Service.

they may aspirate the "cap" when
their head is back thus straightening
ottt the structures in the throat and
creating an almost straight tube
from mouth through throat and in-
to the lungs. With a foreign body
lodged in the throat occluding the
airway tteither we nor 5 Quad could
help a victim without surgically

lopening
obstructon with a tracheostomy, a
tricky procedure even when per-
formed under the most ideal cir-
cumstances and specially difficult as
a “first-aid" maneuver. Time is a
factor —- seconds is all the patient
has.

1 would ask students in the cold
light of sobriety to ask themselves
how they‘d feel if one of their peers

;died as the result of such a game.
