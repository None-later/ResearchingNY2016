lRETROSPECTIVE:

The Revlval of the Gut

Albany's downtown area was reviving after tlte Old
Smith mall, called the Gut, had been cleared. One man
predicted that the area was going to rival New York City
in the 1980's. "i give Albany five more years." said
Donald Short 8 commercial artist. “Then it'll be sw-
ingin". it's going to be a big apple like New York."
What happened?

Students Busted for Drugs

Two students. Pat Lenihan and Mike Ryan were rotis-
ed from their lndian Quad roorrr at 5 am. by state and
campus police who were looking for dope. Lenilran had
apparently sold drugs to an undercover cop and had
taken him to his room to complete the sale. The State
police came with a search warrant and found storage of
marijuana and LSl). Dorm directors were outraged that
they were not informed of the raids. Then dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Detrn Brown failed to inform anyone prior

culture."

"New Wave atrd punk are real,
and came out of the seventies," he
said. "It was a reaction to the over-
comurcrciali/ntion of rock. I’ttnk it
Hiking the music brick to the garage
band to capture its vitality."

“The difference is that its in»
t'lucncc is so much smaller than that
of the popular music of the si\tics.
it‘s a much \tlttlllct‘ group or Dw'm.
than the hippie thing.“

Ward contends. “there is and
was a real ptrtrk scene is New York,
l,os Angelcs and. tor a time, Armin
(Tums). The Austin punk scene was
very. \’L‘I')’ hit: in the mid-seventies,
but the media didn't pay arty atten—
tion to it because of Willie Nclcnn
and the progressire country move-
ment. liut both were going In) at mu
same time.“

Ward said the preppy lad is also
indigenous to the eighties.

“it is very big. and has moved all
the way down to the iurrior high
level. Kids was $35 l..l.. llcun
shirts. It‘s a dominant scene on
campus, but it shouldn't be
Inisurulcrstood. it‘s said that this is
(1 lot more conservative generation
and a flashback to the fifties.
llltll's an oversimplification A lot
ol the students who dress preppy
still take drugs and tune \cr'y dit-
t'crent sevual attitudes from that ol'
the 1950s. The stereotype is just too
easy.“

Most obscncrs agree that the one
sivtics plrenorrrerrorr that‘s been ab—
solutely banished from campus to-
day is the hippie lil‘cstylc.

.lack Nachbar, a colleague of
Ward‘s at Bowling (irccn, notes,
“Today's students really can‘t
ﬁgure hippies ottt. They ask, ‘Why
would people want to dress funny
like that. with their unkempt hair?‘
It iust doesn‘t make sense to
them."

in his class Nnchbur plays the
album from the Woodstock music
festival in 196*). When he comes to
“that part where Country Joe
(McDonald) said. ‘Sing louder.
l low ttl'c we going to stop this war it
vou don‘t sing any louder than
ihal'l‘. they all laugh and say, ‘Sing—
inu won't stop the war.’ “

L“'l‘hcy just can't understand that

childlike mentality," Naclrbar
believes. >
Morris Dicksteiu, author ol

(in/m o/‘Iz'rlen, a study of American
crrlttrrc in the t‘)(rt)s and an English
professor at Queens ('ollcgc in New
York. agreed,

“Students today certainly have a
culture of their own. The 1960s
aren't holding thetn down. It's just
that when you have such a surge of
original expression as you had in
the sixties. the culture just can‘t sus—
tain it that long."
