A housing designer says he's got
the answer to .America’s housing
crisis: micro-homes. Architect Bill
Hedley says he plans to build hun-
dreds of tiny condominiums the size
of two-car garages. He claims the
SO-thousand-dollar price tag will
allow first-time home buyers to af-

 

ford a home — complete with living
room, sleeping alcove. a scaled
down kitchen. a tiny bath, a sun
deck and carport. “There‘s no
sacrifice of quality. just space," he
says. "It's like the early
Volkswagen." The first mini con-
dos are scheduled to go up in the
San Francisco Bay area next month.
