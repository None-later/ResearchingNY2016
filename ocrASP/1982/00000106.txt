 ‘ Out on ROTC

 

 u -.., _......... .4” Mww \

1 also notice this person has a lovely way
of twisting information to suit his nccds.
The individual he refers to as being rejected
even though he was six feet tall. blond and
looking like “he belonged” was not re-
jcctcd because he was gay as he leads us to
believe. He was rejected after he got to
training becnusc he didn't possess other
qualities required of a Marine Officer such
as leadership ability.

He also states that "gay" was equated
with criminal records. drug dependency and
low intelligence. Again he misconstrucs thc
facts to support his position. Thcsc
characteristics are all simply disqualifica-
tions for military service and in no way imp-
ly that a homosexual is a criminal. drug user
or unintclligcnt us he seems to suggest.

Aftcr observing this individual I got the
irnprcssiorr he knew the military‘s policy all
along as his qucstions were mostly
r‘lrctor’icul. it also appeared he was only try-
ing to harass thcsc pcoplc in an effort to
gather some "evidence" (rrs his journalistic.
irrdcpth quotc demonstrates) in orch to
justify publicizing his own views. lint he has
rnc pcrplcxcd. if he's so outspoken about
being gay. is so convinced that his position
is in llrc right. and is so eager to voicc his
opinion. why didn't he sign his name.

Coalition Mission

To the Editor:

The ASP's coverage of the Senate
Mcclirrg which look plrrcc on March 1. is
very disappointing. in her choicc oi"
Ircudlinc and in the content of her article.
Liz Reich displayed much nar-
rowrnindcdncss.

Although a good dcal of thc mccling's
discussion of ROTC was ccnlcrcd on the
issue of discrimination based on sexual or
ai‘l'cctional preference. thc question is a
much broader one. Student speakers
discussed the issues of academic intcgrity
and militarism on this campus.

The growing opposition to ROTC has
become so strong that u Coalition Against
ROTC has been formed on this campus.
This coalition embraces many opinions but
shares one goal — the removal of ROTC
from this campus. That the ASP would pre-
sent this movement in such a scusationaliz-
lug. callous manner is indicative of the ex»
tent of the discrimination of guys on this
campus and in our society. It docs not.
however. reflect the full scope of Monday’s
meeting and the involvement of students
and faculty on this campus. Onc cxpccts
nnrclr more from a university newspaper.

The Right Direction

To the Editor:

Congratulations to the Albany Student
Press for refusing to rrrn ROTC advcr-
tiscmcnts on “moral” grounds: bccausc
ROTC and the armed forces in gcncral
discriminate against homosexuals. l was
surprised and gladdcncd by the ncws —
such courage and outspokcnncss is far too
rare these days.

But othcr news in the ASP was vcry
discouraging. Despite the blatant
discrimination. the university will continue
to support ROTC on campus. The article
status that whilc homosexuals arc not
Preventh from taking ROTC classes. thcy
‘nrc prevented from receiving scholarships
and promotions.

Although this may be a national policy.
and clearly a deplorable one. it is. obvious-
,ly. also a local policy. Whether this policy

 

 

 

originates with this chapter or with a
general in Washington is not the point;
discrimination is the point. Discrimination
on this campus. or any campus. has no
place. Univcrsity support for or acceptance
of any organization that discriminates in
any way is do facto support for that
discrimination. and must not be allowed. 1
urgc our Senate to refuse to suppori in any
way any group that discriminates. especially
if the discrimination is so blatant and clear.
Since ROTC sccnrs to fall under the
‘rcading of it group that discriminates, it
should be removed.

Thcrc are all too many problems of
discrimination on this campus. and in our
lives. Most of thcsc arc subtle and hidden.
thn we find one that is obvious. wc must

wise we can ncvcr hope to correct llrc sub»

Setting Back Time .—

‘Therc's a student representative body in this country that thinks it’s OK to
discriminate against gays and lesbians.

Sounds pretty stupid. right?

it sounds a lot like something that would happen in a state like Florida. where
the legislature recently passed a bill intended to prohibit funding of gay and les-
bran organizations in the state universities.

But it didn't happen in Florida. It happened right here in Albany.

Just before vacation Central Council rejected a resolution which said Council
finds the Army ROTC extension center in violation of the university’s policy
forbidding discrimination against homosexuals.

it seems like somebody turned the clock back a few decades at that meeting —
back to a time when our govcrnmcnt‘s leaders encouraged discrimination
against blacks. Jews. and women (among others). Our student leaders are still
backing discrimination against some of the others —— gays and lesbians.

Thcrc wcrc sornc people at the Council meeting that forrght for the resolution.
.lci'i' Fromm. a sponsor of the measure. felt that students should show their op-
posirion to this blatant discrimination hy the Army and its ROTC center on
campus. SA l’rcsidcnt Darvc i’ologc stressed the contradiction prcscntcd by the
university supporting ROTC whilc claiming to cnforcc a policy prohibiting
drscrunrruuion against homosexuals. Rut t'lawcd logic like that ol‘John B. Mar-
tin swaycd Central Council more than ideals of equality.

Martin cluirncd llurt lhc discrimination inherent in ROTC was (inc to Army
policy. not RO'i’C policy. He sccrns to have i'orgoltcn that ROTC is a branch of
the Army. Army policy is ROTC policy. The Army‘s homophobia is ROTC's
homophobia.

('cnlr'al Council's r'cjcction of thc r'csolnrion is a shame to the students. Coun-
cil should not lurvc ctrdtu‘scd the discrimination that ROTC is bringing to this
campus. 'i'hcir‘ hick of support for lfr'orurn‘s r'csolution puts tlrcrn at odds with
the majority oi‘ sludcntx at SllNh’A. who hclicvc that sexual preference is no
grounds tor discrirrrirnrtion.

('crrlrnl ('ouncil‘s complicity with a university administration that r'cl‘uscs to
cutor‘cc rrrrli-discr‘iruirurtion policics (Hill a military unit that practices
discrirulrurtion is just plain disgusting.
