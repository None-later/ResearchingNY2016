The Mouth

 

 

Hello. l'd like to introduce
myself. i am the Mouth. i am the
ASP’s answer to nasal congestion.
First of all, the question of the day
is how do you keep Fernando
Valenzuela out of Dodger Stadium?
Answer: Yell immigrationi. ..
Moving along to boxing, Caveman
Lee’s record going into Marvin
Hagler fight was an impressive 22-l
with 2] KO’s. But the Mouth has
learned that 15 wins were against
cat/cwomcn and the other seven
came at Colonial Quad's boxing
night. . .Can you believe that the
Mels are trying Lee Mazilli at se-
cond-base? Well if he doesn’t make
it at second, he'll definitely be the
highest paid batboy in Met

Leonard. mixing praise and ridcule
as effectively as left hooks and right
crosses, set up challenger Roger

~Stat‘ford Thursday and chopped

him down at the news conference
that officially announced their up—
corning title fight.

Leonard. the undisputed world
welterweight champion with 22
knockouts and only one loss in 32
lights, called Stafford a worthy
challenger. then predicted he'd
knock him out with ease. The
lS-round hout was set for May 14.

Tickets were priced at $100. $60,
$40. and $20. The fight will televis-
ed worldwide. according to Dan
Doyle, president of K0 lnc.. but it
will he blacked out huh: and in near-
by Rochester and Syracuse.

City officials said there hasn't
been a title bout here for 30 years,
perhaps dating back to heavyweight
champion Ezztird (‘lim'lcs' fourth—
round knockout of Freddie
litiyshorc in l‘)50.

history. . .The addition of Paul
Weslphal fills a vital Knickerbocker
need: the year long search for Mike
Newlin’s roomate is over, and Mike
will no longer feel embarrassed in
the showers. . .The Mouth has
another exclusive —- Gerry Cooney
is reportedly close to signing for a
tune-up bout with lightly regarded
diet guru Richard Simmons. The
Mouth is glad to see that Cooney‘is
not just fighting another
stiff. . .The Mouth does not want
to infer that Aser third baseman
Arty Howe id bald. but he is often
confused with Woody
Popper. . .The Mel's current in-
field has more holes in it titan Bob
Lemon's nose. . .Albany State

basketball team recent performance
at the SUNYAC tournament can be
compared to Linda~Lovelaee's per-
formance in Deep Throat. They
both choked on the big one.
'Tongues up: to the New Jersey
Nets for bringing professional
basketball back to the metropolitan
area, and to the Great Dane basket-
.ball team for another outsianding
(regular) season; the Mouth en-
joyed it. as usual. Yawn'of the
week: to the New York Yankees
(alias the Striders) who are as ex-
citing to watch as auto racing is
without crashes. What do Bernard
King, Greg Roberts, David
Overstreet, and Quintin Dailey have
in common? None of them will ever
be invited to a sorority party on
campus.
