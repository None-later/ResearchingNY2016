The Albany State men’s varsity
swimming and diving team brought
home a seventh place ﬁnish from
the State University of New York
Athletic Conference Champion-
ships (SUNYACS) held at Geneseo.
Although they dropped con-
siderably from their third place
standing of a year ago. the Danes
were far from being disappointed
with their 1982 outing.

The squad realized that the big-
gest flaw in their recent perfor-
mance was not lack of quality. but
lack of quantity. “We just didn't
have the depth. We covered all the
events. but that’s not enough in the
States. You really need more than
only one guy in each event," ex-
plained Albany coach Dulce Fer-
nandez. “Also. it’s not that we were
bad. it was just that the competition
was better this year."

Indeed. the Danes' efforts were
far from “bad.” In addition to the
fact that senior Neal Ullman set a
new school record. the squad
aboundcd with personal best times.

of course, co-caplain Ullman
was the big news of the tourney. A
time of 56.5 seconds in the lOO-yard
backstroke eclipsed the old Albany
record by a half second. and gave
Ullman a third place in the race. In
addition this feat, the swimmer cap-
tured a third place in the ZOO-yard
backstroke (2105.8). a sixth place in
the ZOO-yard individual medley
(2:05.5). and was part of three relay
teams which also fared well.

As a result of his bountiful out-
put. Ullman scored the most points
on the Albany squad." He was pro-

bably our most outstanding swim-

mer at the meet. Neal‘s swimming
was also a motivating factor for the
whole team." noted Fernandez.

V “Overall. 1 was pretty happy
(about the SUNYACs)." reﬂected
Ullman. The senior added some
thoughts on his ﬁnal season. "Be-
ing captain. it was really good to be

able to help out a little with the
younger guys. Personally. for my
last year. it was really rewarding.
l’m glad i went out as a winner.”

Aside from the accomplished
senior. three other teammates did
well by recording personal best
times. Freshman Jeff Ball never
went faster in the 100- or ZOO-yard
backstroke. as he sped to times of
l:01.8 and 2:l3.9, respectively. His
efforts were recognized with an
:Ieventh place in the mo and a
seventh place in the 200.

Frank Kozakiewicz and Frank
Parker complete the “personal
best" trio. Kozakiewlcz's time of
2:21.5 in the ZOO-yard breaststroke
gave him fifth place in the event.
Parker's time of 2:l6.4 in the
ZOO-yard butterﬂy was a personal
improvement of over ten seconds.

Complementing the aforemen-
tioned statistics. several additional
events yeilded points for the Dane
swimmers: fifth place in the
400-yard medley relay — Ullman.
Kozakiewicz, Tom Handy. and
Dave Zybala (3:532); seventh place
in the 300 freestyle — Handy.
Ullman. Zybala. and Ed Pierce
(735.8); seventh place in the
400-yard freestyle relay — Handy.
Pierce. Ullman. and Zybala
(3:25.l); fifth place in the lOO-yard
breaststroke —- Kozakicwicz
(l:05.2); tenth and eleventh in the
50-yard freestyle — Zybala and
John Streetcr. respectively (23.l

23.2). Points were awarded to
ﬁnishers in the top twelve.

Handy. although obviously mak-
ing a contribution to the Dane ef-
fort. was not up to par with his
spectacular regular season times.

This year the freshman broke two

Albany records that had both ex-
isted for at least six years. Times of
5:04 in the 500-yard freestyle and
10:39.5 in the lOOO-yard free both
etched Handy's name in the record
books.

Handy had quite a reasonable ex-
planation for his drop in the
SUNYACS. “I didn't know what to
expect as a freshman. It's really a
long season —- so I just burnt
myself out. Next year I am going to
try to peak at the right time."

Unlike the freshman who looks
ahead. four seniors and diver John
Anderson can only look back. John
Doerncr. Ullman. and Zybala each
ended their careers with the State
meet. Steve Rabinowitz, also a
senior and team co-captain. did not
compete in the SUNYACs. Fer-
nandez pointed out that the four
year swimmer was “an important
element during the school year."

Overall. the SUNYACs ended the
team’s season on an up note. Fer-
nandez expressed praise for
Potsdam. the lourney's champion.
In addition she stated that “it seem-
cd that they (the Albany swimmers)
were happy with their times. i know
that I was happy."

"We often compete against
teams that have indoor facilities,
but we just use what we can. The

team has worked hard. sacrificed
— running in the tunnels. which
was a key to success in the men‘s
team. doing road work and weight
training. They deserved what they
got." said Albany women's track
coach Ron White.

What the team got for their train-
ing efforts were 13 new school
records and a very respectable
showing in the Eastern AIAW Divi-
sion III Indoor Track and Field
Championship.

Albany finished thIfth out of 2|
teams in this meet. which took place
on March 6 and 7 at Bates college.
Holy Cross took first with a sizable
217 point lead over the nearest
finisher. Albany found itself in
twelfth place with only a six point
gap between their score rind the
score of the eighth place finisher.
