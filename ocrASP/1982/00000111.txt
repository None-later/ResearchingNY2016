Bradley ’3 Beef

Each March. the NCAA has tltc unenviable tas ' of comrng up wttt
a 4R tcam field for their month long extravaganza known as the Divi-
sion I basketball championship. Twenty-eight of these bids are

automatic. coming from either the post-season conference tournament
or. if there is no tournament. the regular season champion. the rest of
the 48 bids are tit-large bids; they are open to the best of the remaining
teams. Naturally. then. there is a good deal of complaining when the
bids are announced. and we see which teams will compete for the na-
tional title. and which teams will compete for the NIT title. This
. season. one team in particular has a legitimate gripe for not being in-
cluded in the NCAA.

Despite the presence of 1981 MT champ Ttrlsa. and national power
Wichita State. the Bradley Braves won the regtrlar season title in the
Missouri Valley conference this season. Coached by Dick Versacc.

.rndley compiled a 90-9 regular season mark. a record that included

11 road wins. They were knocked out ofthe conference tournament by
Illinois State. 55-50, in double overtime. in the semi-finals. but the
Braves still expected an N( ‘AA bid. since no MVC champion had been
denied one in the long history ofyhe leagrrc. Tltclr losses included a
total often overtime periods. and close losses against Wichita and San
Francisco. Tltcy also beat Wichita once. won the only matcltup of the
season against Tulsa and. on tltc 'ttstcrn swing. defeated St. Francis
(PA) by 31. Penn Statc by 17. and St. Joseph's by 13. Yet. when the
bids were announced. Bradley didn't have a date for the big dance.
and cries of fotrl were heard from Peoria. The coach was furious that
the MVC had one team out of 48. whole the Big East. a fairly strong
bttt relatively new conference. had four. Was it coincidence that the
commissioner of the fair.- littst was chairman of the selection commit-
tee? Let’s check the tttcts.

Of the four Big East teams that made tltc NCAA, certainly
Georgetown and Villanotrt dcscrvc bids without question. St. .Iohn‘s
also won 20 games this season. won the Holiday Festival at Madison
Square Garden. anti played a good schedule. The fourth team from
the Big East is Boston College. tt team that has done very well in the
tournament thus far. heating San Francisco atrd DePaul. both of
whom were Iavorctl to heat the littgles. During tltc regular season.
Boston College sported an lR-tl record. then split two games in tire Big
East tortrnamcttt for it |‘)-‘) tally. Included in those 19 wins however.
are conquests of such national powers as Bentley. Stonehill. Brown.
New Hampshire. Mcrrimacl: and St. Anselm‘s. Fottr of these schools
aren‘t even Division 1. while Brown was 5-21 and UNH 8-16. Despite
the Eagles' fine tournament performance. it is apparent that their
schedule did not merit tltcrn receiving an NCAA bid. The commis—
sioner. however. is not to blame.

The problem with the NCAA selection process is that there are far
too many automatic bids. T-arns like Robert Morris antl North
Carolina A&T just do not helorrg in the tournament. especially at the
expensc of teams like Bradley and lontr. The solution? Why not rttakc
it an open 41l-tcam tournament? This way. we cottld cotne as close as
possible to having the best 481ctrms. which is what the national cham-
pionships are all about. If it Wow done this way. Boston College would
still be in the field. bttt the uttdcscrving teams sttclr as Robert Morris
wouldn’t be.

The problem. then. is not that the Big East commissioner is favoring
his schools, because ltc’s not. The problem is that there is too little

space left over for runner-up teams in each conference. and making
the tournament totally invitational would solve that.

As a sidelight. Bradley played eastern teams in their first two NIT
'appcaranccs last week. They defeated American. 76-65. and then
travelled to Syracuse and soundly defeated the Big East‘s Orangcmcn,
97-84.

If Bradley has a gripe, ltow about Texas‘El l’aso? AT 20-8, they
were marginal for the NCAA. but certainly a shoe-in for the NIT. at
least that is what they thought. For the Miners. only a sad end to the
season though. as the NIT committee loaded up with seven eastern
terms. all of whom have been eliminated already. while Texas A&M,

 

‘1 m"n UTEP beat by 20. is alive in the NIT's ﬁnal eight.

Thc Danes (Ill-10) were passed
over by the N(‘AA after losing both
of their games itr the SUNY con-
ference championships. They had
gone to the NCAA liast Regional in
each of the last two seasons. and
to- the Southern
Regional in 1)anvillc. K‘entueky

three years ago. The last time
Albany played’in the [{(TACs was in
1978. They won that tournament.
defeating Hamilton in overtime,
101-95.

This year‘s version of the [ECAC
tortrncy pitted the Danes against
two teams they played dttring the
regular season. Both earlier mat-
chups were romps. llamilton crush-
ed Albany 76-50 for their only
defeat in University Gym this
season. ()swcgo was a victim of tire
Danes’ home domination. losing
87-68.

Although the end results were
similar the second time around, the
gatncs certainly were not. Both
turned ortt to be hard-fought cort-
tcsts. ncitltcr was decided until late
in the second half.

1n the regular season game
against Oswcgo. Albany jumped
ottt to a big lead front the start. bttt
the Lakers played them nearly even
for two-thirds of the game. This
tinte they played the Danes even all
the way. At halftime Oswcgo was
out in front 34-30.

Brit then tltc Danes began to play
as well as they can play. "We took
charge rigltt away at the start of the
second ltalf." said Albany basket-
ball coach Dick Satters. The Danes

‘sclllctl back into their offense and

r ‘ "meaéhmwmmww.w;mums»...  

patiently began to bttild up a lead.

But with eight minutes left in the
game their offense broke down.
()swcgo ctrt their advantage down
to five points. The Lakers soon
swept into the lead after Albany
freshrnttn Dart Croutler was thrown
ottt of his second post-season game
for fighting. The Lakers converted
the technical foul and turned the
play into five qttick points. They
found themselves leading 62-60.

Crortticr was thrown ortt of a
SUNYAC playoff game one week
earlier when he exchanged punches
with a Buffalo player. “He's too
good a player to do things like
that." said Satters. who benched
(‘routicr against Hamilton in the
championship game.

Brrt Albany got the big play when
they needed it. Reserve forward
Dennis Fagan converted a big tltrec
point play to pttt the Danes bttck on
top with two anti a half tnitttttcs on
the clock. 63-62. Those poittts turn-
cd ottt to bc tltc first of nine
straight. and Albany was able to
rtrrt 0111 the clock.

their first game to set up the
rematch against Albany.

The Danes gave the Continentals
(22-4). ranked second in the New
York State and twelfth nationally. a
difficult time. “It was nip and trick
all the way until the end of the sc-
cond half."l Sauers noted.

Albany was leading by two near
the end of the first half. brtt
Hamilton added a bucket to knot
the game at 28-28.

Bttt the Danes had too mttclt go-
ing against them. Senior .Ioc .lcd-
nak. playing in his last game (along
with Ron Simmons). sprained his
ankle early in the contest. and lie
did not score. With Croutict'. thc
Dttncs' second leading scorer attd

Sttucrs rotated .lan Zatloorinn.
l)ttvc Adam. and John Frci at
guard. Tltc trio chipped itt only two
points each.

Then there was Charles Robin-
son. The 64 power forward killed
lltc Danes in tlticr first meeting with
1‘) points and 12 rcborttrtls. and he
killed them again. hattging in 21
points. "Robinson was the dif-

ference in the game." said Satters.
“He out-hustled us oft the
boards."

_Still. Albany was within striking
distance until the end of the game.
whcn they lost their shooting touch.
"We were trying to be very patient.
httt after awhile when we got the
shots we were missing them." said
Satters. “()ttr pcrimctcr shooting
went coltl in tltc last six minutes."

Albany connected on only 37 pcr-
cent of their shots from the floor.
and Hamilton pumped in 50 percent
of their attempts in the second half
to sttrgc to the winning 10 poirtt
margin.

.lohn Dieckelman led Albany
scorers with 16 poitrts. Mike Gatto
ttotcltcd l4. and Fttgan added 11 to
tie his highest output of the season.
Dicckclman and Gatto were nttmcd
to the All-Tournament team.

Dieckelman was also selected to
the all-SUNYAC team; hc was the
only repeater on that squad. .loin~
ing him on tltc all-East Division
team was Crottticr. anti Suncrs was
voted Coach of the Year.

Third in Union Meet

the race. Howard Williams set a
meet record in the 50 meter dash
with a time of 5.9 seconds. Mttnscy
‘alled it a grcttt effort because
"Williams pulled up irt the qualify-
ing rttcc with a leg twitch anti
almost pttllcd ortt of tire finals. Bttt
he wcttt ottt and won it."

The Dunes suffered at setback
when triple-jumper and 400 meter
runner Brtrce Briggs seriously in-
jured his leg wltilc jumping.
However. he was able to finish third
in the event. Mttnsey is hopefttl
Briggs will be bttck for the spring
season.

Led by two freshmen and two
seniors. Albany smashed a team
record itt the two-mile relay with a
time of 7:56. eclipsing the previous
mark of 8:01 set in 1974. The race
was run by Tad Wynter. Winston
Johnson. Scott James and Bruce

It
I.

Shapiro. Concentrating on the
relays. seniors Shapiro attd .Ittntcs
led Albany to victory in the distance
medley. Jim Erwin and Larry
Mtthan also ran legs iii the race.

Freshman 'l'ont .lttcotrs set two
school records witlt rt sholpttt of
14.41 meters and itr the 35Ap0und
weight with a throw of 13.70
meters. Dan Kennedy tied for third
in the pole vault. He needs to vault
14'10” to qualify for the nationals.
Despite a bad hip. Mitch lhtrvurtl
finished fifth in the 50-ntctcr high
hurdles.

Albany is looking to improve on
last year's fifth place finish in tltc
Collegiate Track and Field Associa-
tion Meet. according to Munscy.
With the success of the many
freshmen on this year's team.
Munscy is very excited about tltc
future for the track team.
