(CPS) A bill tltat would have made
it illegal for Oklahoma colleges and
universities to recognize gay student
groups was killed recently by the
state legislature, which voted down
the proposed bill in the first day of
hearings.

“It‘s unfortunate. very unfor-
tunate," lamented the bill's Spon-
sor. Representative Bill Graves of
Oklahoma City. “I guess they (the
conunittee) want homosexuals run-
rrirrg around the state's campuses.“

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS. MAhCH 23, 1982

Back in December. gay students
at the University of Oklahoma won
a state Supreme Court case requir-
ing the university to recognize them
as an on campus group. Graves' bill
would have withheld state funds
front schools that recognized any
groups that promote condtrct in
violation of state laws. Since the
practice of homosexuality is illegal
according to state stattrtcs I'orhiding
sodomy and lewd conduct, Graves
said. the trill would effectively pre-

vent funding of gay student groups.

In Florida, a similar bill called the
Trask-Bush Amendment .was pass-
ed by the state legislature last year.
Ian was subsequently ruled un—
constitutional by thc Florida
Supreme Court.

Opponents of the Oklahoma
legislation charged that. even if the
bill was approved. it would have
been rrrled unconstitutional by the
courts.
