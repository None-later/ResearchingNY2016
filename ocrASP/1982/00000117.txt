Such reports contradict most of
the student job market predictions
made Just last fall.

The Endicott Report predicted
accelerated campus recruiting in
many industries, with average star-
ting salaries rising nine percent. The.
College Placement Council's survey
ol‘ SSI recruiters also uncovcrcd
widespread corporate expectations
ol' increased collcgc hiring. The an-
nual Michigan State survey of 428
businesses, however. cautioned
“pockets ol‘ prospcrity" would
lntlrtncc our hiring dcclincs in some
industries. .

ALBANY SIUDENT PRESS, MARCH 23, ~1982

Baughan. Bauglran cautioned "it’s"
too early to make statistical com-
parisons" Lo last year. ,

“A recent increas: In the‘
numbers of chemical engineering
students has hr ought in new interest
from steel and related industries."
she added. ‘

Generally, the‘ placement officers
credit det‘cnsc-rclatcd industries'
recruiting with keeping student in-
lcrvicw traffic close to last year's
lcr'cls. .

"Twenty to 25 percent of the
ovcrall defense spending increases
will directly beneﬁt California."
Milli Cal Siatc-Sncramcnto's Mit-
chull, "and it shows."

"Rccrulimcnt is up lhrcc-to-livc
twicclii in technical areas. and I
\\0tli(i guess it's up over St) pcr‘ccnt
in dcl'cnsu-rclrrlcd industries." lrc
suid. “Instead of sending one
rccrrrilcr'. rln- ricl‘cnsc-rclalcd corn-

T—SH

'panles are sending in three or four.
They're going Into the classrooms
and dorms to seek students out."

At Johns Hopkins, the defense-
relatcd ﬁrms are also “doing a brisk .
business." Baughan said. But at
Vanderbilt, Sellers reports "they
seem to be keeping it close to the.
chest."

But across the country, Lindquisi ’
said “prime defense contractors are
showing outstanding strength, and
so are those who supply them."

The military itself has stepped up
recruiting. especially of liberal arts
majors. But Mitchell says that stu-
dent desires “for something a little
more glamorous than the armed
forces"- has inspired a renewed in-
tcrcst in other government agencies.
“Applications to the CIA are way,
way up." CIA recruitment chicl‘
('htlrlcs Jackson confirmed "we are
very rrctlvcly recruiting.“

There’s a better way
to get there this weekend.

Greyhound is going yoitr way with trouble-tree, economical
service.You can leave directly lrom campus or other nearby locations.
Most schedules have stops at convenient suburban locations. And
talk about comfort. You get a soil, reclining seat and plenty ol room
for carry- on bags

So next trip, go with the ride you

can rely on. Go Greyhound.
