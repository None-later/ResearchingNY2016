_______._.______._——

Despitc a disappointing perfor-

the New York State Collegiate
Track and Field Association Meet
at St. Lawrence University last
weekend.

The Great Danes. with 34.5
points. barely edged Rochester (33
points). Buffalo State (32 points)
and Ithaca (28 points). Fredonia
was the surprise winner with “8.5
points followed by Cortland with
107.5 and Colgate with 1,73 points.

The meet was one of mixed emo-
lions for Albany. The team com-
pleted the indoor season as perhaps _
the finest ever fielded by the school.
according to Coach Bob Munsey.
They managed- to exceed last year‘s
fifth place finish at the Collegiate

Association Meet. But for several
of the team members. this weekend
was disappointing and will be
remembered for what might have
been.

Mitch Harvard. running in pain.
had a bad day. Still being bothered
by a bad trip. he could only place
sixth in the 55-mcter ltigh hurdles.
The l500-metcr rtrn saw Bruce
Shapiro come in a very disappoin-
ting sixth. He was expected to place
very high in the race. Mnnsey blam-
cd his performance on physical arid
mental‘vcxhnustion.

Pole Vttulter Dan Kennedy was
devastated by his poor- perfor-
mance. according to Mttnscy. Nor-
mally a l4’6“ vaulter. he was
unable to do better than 13'5".
Freshman Joe Pastel managed a
fifth place finish in the event with a
vault of t3'6'.’

There were also several heart-
breaking stories for the Danes this
past weekend. Tltc distance medley
had Albany missing a sixth place
finish and picking up a point by
one-tenth of a second. The Danes
sorely missed injured Bruce Briggs

in the triple jump. In this event.
they again just missed placing —
this time by the distance of one
millimeter. The saddest story was in
the 500-meter run. Tony Ferretti.
running a great race, was fouled at
the finish line and he would have
placed fourth; however. an official
disqtralified him for stepping out of
line earlier‘ in the race. ‘
There were many bright notes for
the Danes. tlrotrglr. Eric Newton
broke the‘sclrool record he set lasi
week;in the 400-meter dash with of?
time of 5|.2l seconds. conting‘in

third place. Howard Williams ran
the 55-meter sprint in 6.56 seconds.
finishing fourth. The winning time
by Simmons of Hamilton was only
one-twentieth of a second faster.
The two-mile relay was Albany's

only win of the meet with Larry

Mahon. Winson Johnson, Jim Er-
win and Scott James running a very
fast 7:57.5.

James was favored in the
lOOO-meter run. However, he was
boxed in on the four lane track and
could only finish third in 232.9.

The team has a week off and then
begins the outdoor season Saturday
April 3. at Broekport in the three

,f'team meet. Also competing will be

Buffalo State.
