from copyright law because it did

not control the content of the

signals it carries. He held EM] selec-

tively chose the signal of WOR over

WSiiK-TV of Boston as more
' marketable.

Howcvcr. the judge did not
award damages as requested by
Doubleday Sports. which counter-
sued to stop the rebroadcasis and
asked for $50,000 damages a game
during the I98] season. Although
Doubleday has contracted with
other outlets to carry certain games,
WOR carried about 100 of the
team's l62 games last season.

Critical to the ruling was Mc—
Curn‘s finding that EMI‘s rebroad-
casts were “public” even though
they were transmitted only to iv
“licadcnds.” or receiving antennas
where the signals could be
rcconvcrtcd to television frequcn~
cies for subscribers.

“Had Congress intended the WAV/liiillli
word ‘publie' to be limited to
members of the viewing public, it
could easily have limited the dct'inL
lion. Such is not the case." McCurn
wrote. -
