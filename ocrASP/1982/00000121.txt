Much was hoped for. but little

was expected from the l981-82~
Albany Great Dane basketball ‘

team. Coach Dick Sauers lost three

starters to graduation. two of them .

four-year performers. and was forc-
ed to start two freshmen in the
backcourt. Two other first year
players were the backup guards on a
squad that little resembled the ex-
perienced NCAA playoff teams of
the past three years, three teams
that boasted a combined 64-l8
.record. . '

 

 

This season'wa‘s suppbscd to be
one for rebuilding for the Danes.
When they lost titree of their first
seven games to marginal teams the
shadow ofdoubt hanging over them
darkened.

But then the team began to gel.
An overtime win over RPI proved
to be the start of a seven game win—
ning streak. During that tear they
won the Great Dane Classic tourna-
ment, they defeated Division ll
l—lartwick for the first titne in nine
years. and they beat Onconta. in
Oneonta, for only the second time
in ii years.

“i thought we might get off to a
slow start." Sauers noted. "1 think'
when we won tlte (irctrt Dant- tour-
nament the guys knew they could
win them. That. and the win 0\‘t:r
islartwick. started it. They knew
they could play \vith anybody on
the schedule."

Albany then lost a squcaker lo
Cortland for their first cottfercnce
loss. and they were blown otrt by
Hamilton by 26 points for perhaps
their biggest loss ever at home.

.But when SUNYAC arch-rival
Potsdam rolled into University
Gym. the Danes were back on the
upswing. They toppled the defen-
ding nationai champions before a
capacity crowd. 72-62. They ran
their record to 15-6 overall and 7-1
in the conference before they faced
a critical showdown with Cortland,
the surprise team in the East divi-
sion.

if Albany lost. they would need
to beat Potsdam on the road to
make the playoffs. Cortland also

needed a win to stay alive in the.

'race. The Danes crushed the

Dragons. 101-6], but star forward'

Imarks. but Albany won a coin toss
for the rigitt to be seeded first in the
SUNYAC tournament.

The Danes were now thinking
playoffs. anti they had a right to.-
Thcy had the best overall record in
the tournament, the winner of
which receives an automatic bitl lo'
the NCAAs. it was generally agreed
that if they won one gtttnc in the
tourney they would receive an ill-
large bid to the NCAAs.

But the Danes left Buffalo
empty-handed. they lost to the
University of Buffalo and Buffalo
State. and the NCAA selection'
committee passed them over. in-
stead. they were invited to the
ECAC Upstate New York tourna-
ment where they finished second,
'losing to Hamilton in the finals.

“it would have been a great
achievement if we made the
NCAAs; this team is too young.
realistically. to make the NCAAs."*
Sauers said with a trace of.
wistfulness. “The, only disappoint-

ment was when we came so close to
beittg selected. it was disappointing
that we needed only one more game
rd make it and we couldn‘t \virt it."

The Duties finished at iii-ll) tutti
were ranketi irt a sixth place tic irt

poll. received an til-large bid to the
NCAAs and wcrtt till the way to the

But. maybe more important.
Albany has set the stage for their
return to national prominence for
the next few years.

“We have laid a good founda-
tion. We need some help in buy a
couple of areas." said Sauers.
"We're trying to recruit people to
fill our needs. but if se can fill them

- hcrc(from within the program). we
will."

All-SUNYAC and ECAC Upstate
New York honors this season. and
he was the fourth leading scorer in
the conference. Gatto was the
team’s second leading rebonntler
with 220 and third leading scorer
with 119.7 average.

This season the development of

‘ the freshmen was the big surprise

for the Danes. "The freshmen. as a
whole. developed and becatnc part
of the team.“ said Satrers. “At the
start tire freshmen were ruore than
holding their own. As tr group they
played with confidence and poise
and filled the roles we asked them
to fill."

perhaps their greatest weakness is
one that only time cart heal—inm-
pcricnce. Tire Dunes were only (i-t)
when they were on the road this
season. and only as the learn
matures will that statistic improve.
“We have to be able to overcome
that." said Sauers. “We have to be
able to win on the road."

When next seasor'i' rolls around.
the Danes are going to have ottc
very experienced team. Many of the
‘new players gained some valuable
playing time in one of the finest
“rebuilding” years ever.

“The year before there is no
question irt my mind we were a na-
tional (Division ill) level team."
said Sauers. “We weren't al the
start of this year. With the addition
of one or two key players we will be
again next vcar "

Arthur M. Schlesinger .lr.,
reknowned historian and Chairman
of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Centennial Commission. spoke on
FDR‘s legacy and contrasted it with
Reagan's "New Federalism". also
conversing on a diverse spectrum of
political topics in a speech Wedncs
day night in the Campus Center
Ballroom.

“Reagan taxes the poor and gives
to the rich. and Roosevelt was. of
corrrse. just the opposite." Schles-
inger told the packed ballroom of
an estimated 600 spectators.

Schlesinger. who served as
Special Assistant to Prcsdient John
F. Kennedy in 1961. analogized
FDR's l932 administration artd that
of Reagan‘s l982 “New
Federalism" as “both facing a sea
of economic trouble.” and warned
that “a major depression is no
longer inconceivable".

Schlesinger. professor of
Humanities at the City University
of New York, spoke for approx-
imately one hour in commemora-
tion of the hundredth anniversary
of FDR's birth and the ﬁftieth an-

niversary of his presidential elec-
tion. _

He characterized Roosevelt as a
great humanist. whose “fireside
chats were a memorable way to talk
to people over the heads of Con-

gress."
Schlesinger. speaking with reso-
nant confidence. blamed “the

chronic inflation of dirt age" on
FDR’s economic stabilizers. which.
“by making the economy
depression-proof. also made it
inflation-prone."

The key to Roosevelt’s political
philosophy. Schlesinger asserted.
was “the ability of man to control
the economy he ltad created".

Roosevelt served as New York
State Governor before his 1932
campaign battle with President
Herbert Hoover. which Schlesinger
tertned "not only a clash of men.
bill a clash of philosophies."

Roosevelt. "who mended evils by
reason and experiment." opposed
Hoover's iaissez-fnire policy. in
which government does not in-
fluence business. When elected. his
“New Deal" breathed new life into

The Department of Rhetoric and
Communications (RCO) stands to
lose half its teaching staff this fall if
this year’s budget cuts are as severe
as anticipated. according to Dean
of the College of Humanities and
Fine Arts John W. Shumaker.
The anticipated $2.2 million
reduction in funding means that no
vacant positions can now be filled.
forcing Shumaker to pare 45-60
positions within the College of
Humanities and Fine Arts. and
making it impossible to fill five
vacancies in the RCO Department.
Next fall. the RC0 department
will ltavc six full-time and one part-
time professors. he said.
With approximately 400 RCO

Sttrdcnt opposition overpowered
a proposal by Alumni Quad Coor-
dinator Liz Radko to turn Pierce
and Sayles Halls into graduate
dorms beginning next fall.

Undergraduates in both dorms
told Radko they wanted to remain
in their dorms.

“Sayies Hall is a special dorm
because it promotes the interna-
tional spirit.” said Sayles Council'
President Mike Nango.

Sayles is ofﬁcially designated as
the international House and many.

“Tire university worked so ltard
to make Sayies an international set-
ting. Wc'rc one of the few univer-
sities that has it — Why should we
give it up?" said Nango.

Pierce Council Citair Steve
Geurds also opposed the plan. say-
ing that Pierce residents were
“emotionally tied" to their dorm.

Radko said “after looking over
all counter proposals to the pro-
blems between graduates and
undergraduates. we found no solu-
tion would be foolproof."

Director of Residential Life John
Martone said the reason the pro-

'eredited FDR with saving
“capitalism from the capitahsts".
noting that Roosevelt cut
trncmployment by one-half by l940.
until it virtually disappeared during
World War ll.

Roosevelt's foreign policy was
one of great foresight. whose “mis-
sion encircled the planet."

"We were disenchanted after
World War l.“ Schlesinger remark-
ed. “ln 1936 FDR undertook a
trrgent anti eloquent carttpaign to
reintegrate the US. ittto foreign
policy."

“Roosevelt had hopes. not illrr-
sions. about the Soviet Union."
Schlesinger reflected. “He foresaw
the rise of nationalism in the Third
World."

l-le belillicd Reagan‘s Soviet
policy. quoting a statement the
President ntadc one year ago: "Let
us not deludc ourselves. Tire Soviets
underlie all the holspots of the
world."

Schlesinger quickly cited conﬂicts
in Iraq. El Salvador. Ireland. Cam-
bodia and other “hotspots” where
Soviet influence is minimal.

To a hearty round of laughs.

Schlesinger spoke of Reagan again.
saying. “Reagan compared himself
to FDR last night...as a man of
compassion. Obviously a piece of
ntniablc check on our President's
part."

Schlesinger latrded Roosevelt as
“the creator of the imperial
Presidency.” whofashioned the

modern .White House style by his
introduction of secretarys. aides
and advisors.

“The Presidency itself grew
through Roosevelt." he stated. He
pointed out that Roosevelt‘s staff

will be a little over 60:].

Staff reductions. in turn ltave
forced the department to drop
courses scheduled in the Fall 1982
course selection booklet. The
popttlar introductory course, RCO
too. will not be offered. nor will
RCO 212. 330. 355 or 465k. Section
sizes have been increased in five
other courses.

"(We‘ve) given more emphasis to
rppcr level courses so that students
can graduate." Shumaker said.

Adjustmentshave been made in
the RC0 major program. Accor-
ding to a memorandum Slrtrmaker
will issue to all majors. “The
department has issued a waiver of
six credits of elective RCO courses;
hence all students can. and are en-

becatrsc "input by the committee
on Student Residence of tire Stu-
dcnl Affairs Cotrncil would not be
available trntil after the designated
housing sign-up period."

“i haven‘t even been down to
talk to the students about this.”
Martone admitted.

Radko said one of the problems
with the proposal was that while
there were complaints from grads
and undergrads. neitlter wanted to
change dorms."

However. Nango was unaware of
any complaints between gratis and
undergrads. _

He did say he had heard of pro-
blems in Brubacher and felt that
Radko was concerned that these
problems might exist in Sayles as

with 30 graduation credits rather
than 36 (a 30 credit ntajor is in ac-
cordancc with university
guidelines). To complete their 30
credits. majors may substitute up to
six credits front courses in other
departments for RCO electives."

The RCO department is in an ex-
tremely susceptible position. accor-
ding lo Rhetoric and Communica-
tions Chair Joseph Woelfel.

Approximately half of the RC0
staff are adjunct professors or TA's
who are hired on a yearly or course
by course basis. “The adjunct
faculty are the easiest to sieze".
says Woelfel. These positions open
up ntore rapidly and are not slated
to be re-filled.

The sever faculty cuts have raised

Part of Radko’s proposal would

spokesman George Valentine con-
dtreted a study last year of 40
graduate students who" left the

was not so much the noise that

as mice and roaches.

This year Valentine organized a

concerned about the proposed

questions of whether or not the
RC0 department can maintain its
level of quality education.“0ur
first priority is to meet the re-
quirements of the students." says
Shumaker.

Shumaker is “not convinced that.
the number of faculty matters" and
cites the Judaic Studies and Classics
departments as being excellent pro-
grams with very small staff.

Bttt Woelftl said. “We (the RC0
department) can absolutely trot
tecp up our quality or efficiency."
He says a tired faculty cannot teach
properly. ‘

Woelfel also said “Communiea
tions is one of the most rapidly
growing fields in the market and

,that the number of majors has

doubled in the last four years. He is
a bit discouraged about the faculty
cuts and believed “Communica-
tions should be expanded at the ex-
pense of other programs.”

Total reconstruction of the RC0
department is being considered.

Shumaker and Woelfel both see
the ﬁeld of Communications mov-
ing towards more empirical study.
They said eventually all rhetoric
:ourses will be phased out of the
RC0 department. to be offered in
the English department.

The Communications depart-
ment will probably become af-
ﬁliated with the Social Sciences. or
perhaps form its own separate
school. Shumaker and Woelfel
predict. '

Presently the RC0 department

offers a joint program with
Sociology.
Shumaker pointed out that there
are Communications experts all
across campus in sociology. educa-
