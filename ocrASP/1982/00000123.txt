The new ambulance purchased by
Five Quad Volunteer Ambulance
Service for $28,000 received sttttc
certil‘ccation and was pttt into
operation last Wednesday.

The vehicle replaced it second-
hand ambulance obtained in 197‘)
which had “become totally
unreliable." according to Five
Quad President. Michael Schlissel.

“The ambulance we replaced was
constantly in the shop for repairs.
and we wcrcjust spending too rnttclt
on maintenance costs. We needed a
dependable vehicle so that we
would always have two ambulances
on hand. with one to function as a
backup." Schlissel explained. The
1977 ambulance which had served
us the primary vehicle will now be a
back-up.

According to Michelle Sobcr~
man. Director of Operations for
Quad. an ambulance has a life ex-
pectancy. of approximately five
years. “The vehicle we just replaced
was alreadyvfive years old when we
purchased it for $5,000 in 1979" she
said. "Thc retired tunbttlancc had
36.000 miles on it when it was trad-
ed in. '

Much of the equipment, in-
cluding first aid supplies, bandages.
oxygen and stretehcrs. was taken
from the old vehicle anti transferred
into the new ambulance. which also
came equipped with sirens.
emergency lights. beds. and
cabinets.

The purchase had to be approved
by the Five-Quad Board of direc-
tors and then by the entire volunteer
membership. which includes ap‘
proximately 90 people. The
members serve in various capacities
inclttding New York State certified
emergency medical technicians.
crew chiefs. drivers. attendants.
and radio dispatchers.

The funding for the non-profit
service comes from a combination
of student donations. faculty-staff
fund drives. other fund-raising ac-
tivitics such as selling donuts and
annual appropriation of $l2.00()
from SA. Approximately $I0,000
to $t2.000 is received annually from
students who choose to contribute a
$1.00 split-line donation when pay-
ing their tuition. the money is kept
in it high-interest escrow account
with SA.

According to Five Quad treasurer
Debbie Putzcr. funding for the new
ambulance came entirely from the
student donations.

 

Putzcr said that “‘in addition to I

jobs. supporters claim.

According to Assembly speaker
Stanley Fink. the bottle bill has
gained ttnprecedented support this
year. Additionally. supporters of
the bill feel it stands a good chance
in the state Senate now that Fred
Eckert has resigned as chair of the
Conservation and Recr -ation Com-
mittee. which has jurisdiction over
the bill. Eckcrt, a vigorous oppo-
nent of the bill. was replaced by
Senator John Dunn. a co-sponsor
of the bottle bill.

Meanwhile. Governor Hugh
Carey has recently released a report
which was very favorable to the
bottle bill. New York City Mayor

In 1859. a chance meeting between a poor priest and a street
urchin resulted in a world-wide movement that is still alive
and well today — and still growing.

The priest, who later became St. John Bosco. realized there
were hundreds of boys who were hungry. homeless and
without hope. By giving them bread. he reasoned. only a
temporary solution could be achieved. There had to be a way to
help them help themselves. Education or learning a trade
