Congress Considers Increased-Student  1

WASHINGTON D.C. (CPS)Con-
gressmcn and senators have propos-
ed a variety of alternative-federal
student aid budgets in the past few
weeks, all of which are more
generous than President Ronald
Reagan‘s aid proposals unveiled in
early February. Some officials now
predict the Reagan proposals will be
defeated.

Several committees have already
taken some action, and though few
seem ready to express their will
before April. more alternative aid
budgets are expected.

“Lordy, lordy," joked Jan Lilja.
education analyst with the Senate
Budget Committee, “there'll pro-
bably be a lot more alternatives.
(Proposing aid budgets) seems to be
the latest fad in town.”

"There are seven new ones every
day," said Democratic Senate
budget analyst.

in the Senate, the analyst ex-
pected tlte flow of alternative pro-
posals to slow as soon as “the
Republican leadership cotnes close
to a consensus." he expected that to
happen by April. and has “reason
to think they’ll reject the president’s
proposal."

in the House, the Education-
Lubor Committee has already ap-
proved u student aid budget that inv
creases funding for all tlte major
programs. including the two Presi-
dent Reagan wants to abolish
altogether.

The comrnitlec. however. tradi-
tionally is more liberal in its funding
than the Ways and Means commit-
tee. “lllL'll will weigh the proposals
before passing them on to the full
House for a vote.

The llotlse recommendations are

just one of five 1983 fiscal year

budgets now before Congress.
Besides l’rcs'idcnt Reagan‘s
budget. which proposes to end
various aid programs. dramatically
limit eligibility for others, and‘cttt
landing for the remaining ones by
as much as 20 percent. congress will
soon debate aid proposals from the .
House Education-Labor commit-

tee. from Sen. Pctc Domenici
tR-N.M). Sen. Ernest Hollings
(l)-S.C), and one written by

senators Claiborne Pell (l)-R.l) and
Robert Stafford (R-Vt.).

'l'he Domenici budget
free/.e aid programs at 19x2 levels.
Otherwise, it differs most from the
Rlingan proposals in its vision of
the guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
program.

Domenici would make families
with inconics over $40,000 a year in—
eligible for GSLs and require
families with gross includes between
$25,000-$40.000 to demonstrate
need. President Reagan would re-
quire all fatnilics with incomes over
$14,000 to show nccd.

Domenici would also keep the in-
school interest subsidy the president
wants to abolish. but would require
students to pay it back to the
government after leaving school.

All the alternative budgets. as op-
posed to the Reagan proposal,
would include grad students in the
GSL program.

The Hollinth budget, according
to a Hollings aide, would “continue
current funding levels. Period. No

would

changes in the programs at all. ex-‘

cept to allow for inflation."

Hollings would allow a 7.4 per-
cent increase in spending for Pell
Grants. Supplemental Education
Opportunity Grants (SREOGs),
College Work~Study, State Student
incentive Grants (SSle). and Na-
tional Direct Student Loans
(NDSLs).

The Pell-Stafford proposal asks
for $7.9 billion for student aid in

ALBANY STUDENT PRESS, MARCH 26, 1982

I983. com’bared to the $4.28 billion
President Reagan wants to spend.

Te government is authorized to
spend sdme $5.9 billion in the 1982
fiscal year. which stretches from
Oct. 1. 1981 through September 30,
1982.

Sen. Stafford himself figured
congress will ultimately decide to
fund the programs for I983 at
about the same level as 1982. "The
majority view in the Senate as I left
D.C..” Stafford said at the
American Association of School
Administrators in New Orleans in
early March. “was that domestic
programs cut heavily in fiscal I982
ought to be level-funded through
fiscal 1983."
