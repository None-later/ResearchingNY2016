well. While Warren Beatty gave an
excellent performance in Reds. how
many Oscars does one man have to
take home in one night? And while I
loved Arthur. l'm not sure l'd really
want to see Dudley Moore get an
Oscar for it. Despite unanimously
good reviews. almost no one has

The man who wins the Director's

Oscar. This year Beatty (justly) won.
and he should repeat that victory

. Monday. As a point of interest. this

is the first time since 1964 that the
directors of the live Best Pictures
have all been up for Best Director.

Beatty and Reds may seem good

best for Picture and Director but
Henry Fonda and John Gielgud are
shoe-ins for Actor and Supporting
Actor respectively. Both men have
built strong bodies of work In their 50
years in the business. both give ex-
cellent performances and. most im-
portantly. neither has won before.
Aside from these factors. Fonda has
his illness working for him (the
Academy always tries to give those
deserving at least one award before
they die) and Gielgud is that most

stage actor. it seems inconceivable
that anyone else could win either

Atlantic City is not flashy enough. by
Academy standards. to win.
Katherine Hepburn is also a doubtful
choice. She has already won three
times. so no debt is owed her. and
she is not ill enough to be a sen-
timental favorite. Her only chance is
if the unmentionable happens and
Golden Pond sweeps everything.
Marsha Mason is a stronger nominee
than she appears to be. She is very
popular in Hollywood. as is her hus-
band Neil Simon. Additionally. she
has.been up three previous times
and never won and her performance
as a recovering alcoholic in Only
When I Laugh is full of the kind of
hysterics that mark what the
Academy considers to be good ac-
ting. l don't think Mason will win. but
if she does it shouldn't be taken as a
surprise.

The Best Actress race is basically
between Diane Keaton and Meryl
Streep and the outcome ls really a
toss-up. Keaton has a lot going for
her. She has'the lead in' thegrnost
Aprestigous film of-~ the- -year - and.
though shebas won before.‘ Annie

  
 
 

field the race is tighter. Harold Pinter
and Michael Weller. for The French
Lteutenant's Woman and Ragtime
respectively. had the most difficult
adaptations. and Jay i’resson Allen
and Sidney Lumei produced the
best screenplay (and the best film) of
the year in Prince of the City.
Whether or not Dennis Potter's

adaptation of his own BBC mint- '

series. Pennies Front Heaven. is
really any good ls sorely debated. l
suspect the winner in this category ls
going to Ernest Thompson for his
adaptation of his own play. On
Golden Pond.

in the Best Musical Score
category. i don't thlrik Vangelis'

tioii. The Best Song is always the
biggest seller. That. In case you
haven't been near a radio all year. is
"Arthur's Theme (The Best That
You Cari Do)" by Christopher
Cross.

In the technical categories. Alex
Thompson deserves to win Best
Cinematography for Excalibur. i
suspect. however. that Billy Williams
will win for On Golden Pond.
Chariots 0/ Fire should win Best
lidittng. and The French
Lieutenant's Woman should win
lioth Art Direction and Costume
Design. There are only two
nominees for Best Visual Ef»
lects—v Dragonslayer and Raiders of
the Lost Ark—-and while
Dragons/ayer was a bad movie. its
special effects were sensational. and
if it doesn't win. there's no justice
(Also. Raiders had fewer effects.
which someone should take into
consideration). But since the effects
for both films were done by George
Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic.
l'm not all that sure it matters in the
end.

Anyway. it'll all be over Tuesday

will no doubt be impressed by her
Versatility. The crucial factor may be
a movie that wasn't even released in
1981. namely Shoot the Moon.
Keaton may pick up an extra vote
because she has two strong perfor-
mances currently in release. but
riiore likely than not voters will hold
off voting for her using the logic that
she'll be up again next year.

Though l'd like to see either
Keaton or Sarandon win. i think
Streep will pick up the little golden
man. She is the superstar actress of
the moment. not as popular as the
others commercially. but she has a
stronger critical reputation. As The
French Lieutenant's Woman she
gets to play two roles (which the
membership is always struck by).
one of them with a foreign accent.
These two factors alone should give
Streep the edge. unless of course.
Reds sweeps.

The Supporting Actress Race is
similarly complex. Jane Fonda
doesn't stand a chance and Elizabeth
McGovern‘s Evelyn Nesbit from
Ragtime may be a bit too cute (but
being in last year's Best Picture Or-
dinary People will no doubt be
helpful.) However. Joan Hackett as
a. neurotic actress in Only When I

Maureen Stapleton as Emma

iresses. l. unfortunately. think
Stapleton's age and standing will
make her the winner. Also helping
her is the fact that she may well be
the only performer from Reds to get
an award (and the Academy usually
likes to give the Best Picture at least
one acting award).

Original Screenplay looks like
either Reds or Atlantic City probably
the latter. The Academy‘s
sometimes incredible poor taste
should become clear in the Adapted
Screenplay Award. Harold Pinter's
adaption of The French Lieutenant's
Woman though far from perfect is
the most literate and intelligent of the
nominations. That Ernest Thomp
son's laughably inept version of On
Golden Pond should be nominated
is bad. but the fact that it will win is
almost criminal.

With the exception of one glaring
omission. the music nominations are
relatively decent this year. The omis-
sion is in the Best Score category.
where Tangerine Dream's brilliant
work from Thief has been given the
brushoff in favor of John Williams'
by now standard work (l defy
anyone to tell me the difference bet-
ween hls scores for Superman, Star
Wars. Jaws and this year's Raiders).

as “One More Hour" from Ragtime

Reds and The French Lieutenniit's
Woman should split the technical
awards with the former having the
best chance at editing and
cinematography. The latter should
get costume design. but Bob
Mackie's popularity shouldn't be ig»
nored—he could win for Pennies
From Heaueri. Since there are only
two nominees. it is doubtful that
Dragons/ayer will beat out Raiders
for Best Visual Effects. Raiders
should also pick up the statuette for
Best Sound. considering they
changed the rules so that it could get
nominated. Man of Iron should get
Best Foreign Film. so Hollywood
can show their "unosc" with Solidar-
nosc.

These predictions are based on a
careful study of Academy history
and are. therefore. almost irrelevant.
since loyal Oscar watchers seem to
have more of a sense of history than
the Academy itself. Nevertheless. I
stand by my guesses. but if Reds
loses. blame it on the Ed Asner af-
fair: Hollywood is always worried
about being labeled “pinko” so they
may just want to play it safe.
Sometimes it's hard to remember
that the Academy Awards were
started for the sole purpose of
‘honoring'the best in artistic achieve-
ment. but if they don't stand by that

Once Oscar time comes upon us.
there's a teiideitcy among media-
types to forget about any and all
movies tiiit counted among the tria-
)Ui Academy Awards notiiinees
This is kind of a pity. because
sometimes the best movies of the
year get overlooked. and 'large
numbers of good. entertaining and
worthwhile movies go by the boards.

For example. my own choice for
l‘)h‘i's best filrii. Prince of the City.
has only been nominated for one
()scar. iii the Best Adapted
Screenplay category. and It's a dark
horse. Sidney Lumet. an enoi-iiious-

won an Oscar. despite having helm-
ed such diverse atid notable films as

The ASC frequently snubs good

makes the Best Actor category a joke

Perhaps in years to come Treat
Williams and Jeremy irons will get
Oscars because they didn't get them
for Prince of the City and The
French Lteutcnant's Woman. We

wait as long as i-‘onda.

But when you watch the
Academy Awards on Monday night.
and see numerous artists (some of
them wholly undeserving) have their
salaries shot into the stratosphere.
give some thought to the people
who aren't there:

John Carpenter. who is not a
great director. but whose films are
invariably among the entertainment
highlights of any year. Escape From
New York. made for a fraction of the
budgets of For Your Eyes Only or
Raiders o] the Lost Ark. compared
quite favorably with them. and was
one of the fastest-paced. most ex-
citing atid best-tirade action films
you could want in see.

Ken Wahl. one of the best things

better In this than in Absence of

nominate liirii for something. this
would have made more sense (But

have made more sense than
nominating her for Annie Hall. tori).
Sooner or later. maybe Wahl will be
recognized for the fine young actor
he is.

Nicol Williamson. whose perfor-
mance as Merliti in Excalibur was a
masterpiece of eccentricity. and gave
enormous spirit to a badly-written
but biilliantly-directed movie that
everyone seems to have forgotten
about

John Landis. whose film An
American Weretiiolf in London is
one of the most unusual and enter
taining movies l've ever seen. is only

Kenneth McMillian. one of the

of films—especially Ragtime—and
