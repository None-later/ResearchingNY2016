Bulletin!

We would like to thank all the people who supported
our petition this week. Other students can find a
petition on the PAN-CARIBBEAN office door,
CC349.

The recent proposal to have Michael Manley speak
at S.U.N.Y.A. was denied for April 26, or 27th, 1982.
it was stated that he would be considered for next
semester instead. One of the rationale forwarded was
the fact that too many events were taking place that
week, eg. Robin Tyler, Mayfest, etc. It is the belief of
numerous Third World Groups that their proposals are
not always objectively analyzed. Michael Manley is the
'former Prime Minister of Jamaica. He legitimized
political relations with Cuba when he was in office.
Manley is prominent on the Third World scene
especially in the move to free Zimbabwe and Anjola.
He entertained .the idea of African and Carribean unity.
Manley had success at Temple University, SUNY
Buffalo, Old Dominion University, and Harvard
University.

The Norris Division will featitrc
the Minnesota North Stars. Win‘
nipeg Jets. Chicago Black Hawks
and the St. Louis Blues. Chicago
and St. Louis are tied in points, so it
is impossible to predict at this point
the first round series matchups. St.
Louis has been an utter disappoint-
ment this season as compared to the
107 points the Blues accumulated
last year. Tile Black Hawks are too
erratic on defense to go anywhere.
Most likely, the North Stars will
play the Jets for the playoff divi-
sional championship. Minnesota
made it to the Stanley Cup finals
last year while Winnipeg had the
worst record in the league last year
(32 points). The Jets are the most
improved team in the league this
year (as of the moment they Iiavc 75
points with seven games to play)
while Minnesota is about the same,
btil the North Stars have gained
more “experience.” Obviously,
Minnesota has to be the favorite but
Winnipeg should mttkc the quarter-
final round intcrcsting. Brit Win-
nipeg should be labeled the dark
horse (better yet, the Cinderella
learn) for the whole Stanley Clip
playoffs.

In the Smyth Division, We have
the Edmonton Oilers, Calgary
Flames, Vancouver Canticks and
the LA. Kings. Edmonton ran
away with their division carly.
mainly due to Wayne Gretzky (or
The Great Gretzky as many jour-
nalists like to call him). This season
Gretzky broke the league record for
most goals (76) and most points
(i64). To this date (five Edmonton
games remaining), Gretzky has 88
goals and 199 points. in the first
round of the playoff, the Ohm
should bury the Kings, while the
Flutncs should burn the Cttttucks.
In the quarterfinals, I really can’t
see tltc Oilcrs losing to the Flames.
ill the ()ilcrs' goultcnding slot is
(irant Fuhr. liven though Ftthr is
only a rookie, he has gi'nhhcd much
attention for lacing ihc N.ll.i..
goaltender with the most wins this
season. He also played in the All-
Star game.

So the final four will sci up tltc
semifinal rounds as follows: Milt-
ncsottt vs. Edmonton and Montreal
vs. islanders. in the first series, due
to a coin-toss at the beginning of

I

  

Y”””l”””””l"

, the season, the Norris Division win-

ttcr (Minnesota) will receive the

 

 

home-ice advantage in this best out
of seven series. Edmonton htts Gret-
zky and Fuhr. Nobody has really
put a lid on Gretzky except for
Steve Kasper ofthc Bruins. Edmon-
ton is a lunch-improved team this
year. They are hungry for the Cup.
Minnesota had its problems this
year. engaging in a long non-
winning streak dttring December
and January. Even though the
North Stars marched into the finals
last year. I expect Gretzky will score
enough to pull the Oiicrs ahead in a
close six or seven gatnc scries.
Another difficult series to pick is
the Islanders-Canadiens matchup.
Due to a similar coin flip, the
Patrick Division will receive the
homc-icc advantage (i.e. Islanders).
Both teams are excellent dcfcnsivc-
ly, Montreal is number one While
the islandcrs are number two. The
total number of goals scored by
botit teams this season is roughly
the same, even though the isles have
a higher overall point total. In the
past eight games between these two
teams, the Isles are 6-i-l. The

 i ' isles Shoot for Third Cup

Islanders have a very healthy Mike

Bossy (over 60 goals this season),'

whileGuy LaFlcur has been slump-
ing and injured throughout this
season. Wamsicy for Montreal and
Smith for New York are excellent
goalies. but Wamsleyis a rookie and
we don't know how he‘ll take the
heat in the playoffs. Smith has been
red hot for the Isles in the past two
playoff years. He is tiic prime
reason why the Isles tire tltc two-
timi: Stanley Cup Champions. Willi
the home icc advantage. take the
Isles in a vcry close scvcn game
series.

So. we‘re at an islanders-Oilch
final series. The coin flip has the
Islandch getting the extra game. It
is Bossy and Trotticr vcrsus Gret-
zky. It is Smith vs. Fuhr. The
Islandch plttycd liie ()ilcrs in tile
quarterfiiniis lust ycar with the Isles
winning in six games. The ()iicrs
gavc the Isles the most trouble in
the playoffs lztsl year. With Gretzky
more amazing and the addition of
goaltender Fuhr in tile Iinc-ltp, who
do you pick to win the (.‘up‘.’
