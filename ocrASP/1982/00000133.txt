nastic team qualified for the
EAlAW tournament for the first
time in it’s eight years of varsity
status. “it. was the first time we
qualified as a whole. We have had
individuals qualify before. but this
was a special acheivement.” ex-
plained coach Pat Duval-Spillane.

women a sixth place finish in the
tournament held at lndiana Univer-

for the nationals on an individual

fifteenth. respectively. out ofa field
of 18 participants.
