Final Four. Shoot in N CAAs

(AP) According to center Pat Ew-
ing. the Georgetown Hoyas haven‘t
reached their pinnacle yet. if they
do peak this weekend. the NCAA
basketball title probably will go
home to Washington with them.

“We are capable of playing bet-
ter," said Gcorgetown's 7-1‘oot
freshman sensation, who has led the
Hoyas to the Final Four in New
Orleans. “I've developed somewhat
but i need to learn to do other
things, like how to get other people
open more." '

The sixth-ranked Hoyas have
gotten enough people open for
good shots .to win the West
Their coach, John

Regional.

Dean Smith has brought North Carolina to the Final Four six times

Thompson, said they are playing as
well as they have at any time this
season.

The Hoyas have a semiﬁnal
showdown with 20th-ranked
Lottisville Saturday. The Cardinals
won the Mideast Regional.

In the other semifinal, it will be
top-ranked North Carolina. winner
of the East. against unranked
Houston, which took the Midwest.

Georgetown, 29-6. and
Louisville. 23-9, both are blessed
with deep benches. That fact was
not overlooked by Thompson.

“1 know they have depth and
they use it," said Thompson.

Little Known
Spurs Win With
No Attention

(AP) Nestled in the Texas hill
country is a basketball team that
attracts little attention while
boasting the National Basketball
Association’s top scorer and
leading scoring duo.

The San Antonio Spurs. the
NBA's least recognized good team.
always scent to win their division.
bttt they hardly ever get on national
television. Their fans have a reputa-
tion for being rowdy and
boisterous. but few outside of San
Antonio ever see the team.

Guard George Gervin has receiv-
ed some notice in recent years fo1
winning three scoring titles. and he
is virtually certain to win his fourth
this season, something that only
Wilt Chamberlain accomplished 111
NBA history. He is averaging 33
points per game.

But in December. the Spurs ac-
quired forward Mike Mitchell from
Cleveland. giving them another
scorer to terrorize opposing
defenses. Mitchell is complemen—
ting Gervin wcll, averaging 27
poittts and nine rebounds in a recent
eight-game stretch. For the season
he is scoring at the 20-point pace cn-
visioncd by San Antonio coach Stun
Albcck.

The transition from (.‘lcvelund'e
league-worst team to San Autouir
wasn’t always smooth. hmvcrcr.

“Ilc's come a long way for us.‘
said Albcck. “lie was 10 pounds
overweight w|1cu 11c came and had
forgotten ltow to play hard at
Cleveland."

"I was in ‘(‘|cvcland' '1 shape
said Mitchell. “We walked tltc bail
down the floor and 1 had to bump

more inside with the big guys. so i

~‘.. ~.....   ... .4'

  
   

"They get four new faces on the
floorjn 11 hurry and depend a lot on
their pressure defense. I haven't
made my mind up about
matchups."

Louisville coach Denny Crum.
who guided the Cardinals to the na-
tional title in 1980 and has taken his
team to the Final Four four times,
wasn't too worried about mat-
cltups. He intends to do the same
things that got Louisville to New
Orleans.

“You can‘t change styles and dif-
ferent things." said Crum. “You‘ve
got to figure ottt what's best for
your personnel and go with them.
And. by the end 01' the year. you‘ll
be playing better than if you tried to
work three different styles and
systems. It just doesn't work."

Dean Smith, the coach of 30~2
North Carolina. would like to find
the right formula to win his first na-
tional title. This is his seventh trip
to the Final Four and second in a
row.

“I hope we haven’t played ottr
best game yet." said Smith. echoing
the thoughts of (icorgetown‘s liw-
ing about his club. 11' Smith is right
and North Carolina's best is still to
come. then tltc Tar Heels — with an
awesome starting five —— should
walk away with tile championship.

The task of stopping No. 1 falls
to surprising Houston. which
cmctgcd front the upsct-l'illcd
Midwest.

“()uc uty cttllcd 111cthismotuiug
and said the way to beat Notlh
(‘aroliua is to take :1 10-point lead
in the first half and maintain that
throughout the game." said
Cougars Coach (th Lewis. “That
was pretty good. He didn't tell me
how to do it. though."

 

 

While Experts Shoot ‘-
at Picking Nat’l Champ

The college basketball season has come down to the top four teams
in the country and they will be making the trip to New Orleans this
weekend. Two of our "experts" picked North Carolina in our
preseason picks. and they‘re looking very good. This is the big one
that has eluded Tar Heel coach Dean Smith. and he will face very
rough competition from Georgetown. Houston and Louisville. The
four picks below are our experts' educated guesses and one of them
will be right unless Denny Crum's Cardinals leave with the crown.
>Biff Fischer: lam picking Houston to win the NCAA championship
this weekend. They have the necessary ingredients for an champion-
ship teum: an experienced coach who's beet: there. an estubished star
who can carry a team. good big men. accurate shooters. depth, and
the ability to break a press. They have absolutely no pressure on them.
since very few people expect them to win. North Carolina has no
depth and I think the Cougars can exploit this. Also. should Houston
udvunce to the firm/.1, they should be able to handle the pressure
defense of either Georgetown ur Louisville.
>Bob Bellufiore: Deun Smith will not be denied a seventh time. Now
that he really has the homes that can win, his North Carolina Tar
Heels will get therefirrt tuttittnttl Championshipfor Sntt‘th. But it will
be done by winning two very clme games. because the Ttll‘ I Ice/r never
