Sad new today front the entertainment world: Willard Scott and John
Coleman, weatherman for the Today show and Good Morning America.
respectively, are dead after a brawl in Elaine's. A witness to the incident
tells us'that the two men were involved in a frelndly game of “Can You

brought on by a saccharine overdose. Coleman. mistaking the seizure as
a personal attack stabbed Scott with the umbrella from his Shirley

By M. R. ROGERS
“DON’T cry now little
Joey. It will all be over
pretty soon," said the 30
year-old mother of
three, Linda Perkins.
She grabbed the head of
the wrcathing infant and
with a quick snapping
motion, broke the little
child’s neck. She set the
small limp body in a
chair next to a teddy
bear which the child had
been playing with just
before.

Linda Perkin's
behavior is by no means
an isolated
phenomenon. Rather.

 
 

she is just a part of the
“.Dead Baby Boom" of
the ’80's. Faced with a
‘cepening recession,
middle class families
throughout the country
are killing their offspr-
ing. ,
’ Perkins will sell the
carcass of her infant to a
black market wholesaler
who distributes the meat
to fast food hamburger
chains. The going rate
for baby meat she says is
only about $l.20 a
pound. ‘
f‘n order to find-the

big money, though. one ,

h s to look beyond the

meat and to thc bone.
Accordingito FBI ln-
spector, I Skip
McDonald. ; the black
market wholesalers are
dealing the bones to a
syndicate bf jewelry
makers in Mexico. Here.
McDonald said, the
bones are crafted into
rings. lockers and other
jewelry.
‘ McDonald estimates
that by the time the
crafted baby bone hits
retail market. it is worth
$1,000 an ounce.
Despite the exorbitant
value of dead infants,

We were six curious
yet unsuspecting
volunteers. It came to
pass on Tuesday after-
noon in March. the guest
speaker in tltc Campus
Ccntcr Ballroom was
Leonard Nimoy. former~
Iy Dr. Spock of the Star-
sltip Enterprise. His lec-
turc on what it is lil.c to
be a sci-fi actor. poet.
and world adventurer
was over. Scetningly jok-
ing. lrc tossed out a
rhetorical qucstion as he
stepped down from the
lcctttrn, “Anyonc care

Simultaneously. six of us
juntpcd up front our
seats. Tltcrc was one
freshman, onc
sophomore. one State»
quad resident of thc

advisors, all dedicated
SUNYA associates. We
rushed the stage and
poinccd on him. each of
us, our parental consent

down and
Nimoy’s offer again. His
services had just bccn
procured by various
agencies. amonth which
were SASU. CC,
NYPIRG. UAS.
ASPCA. FBI. and CIA.
No one got the full im-
pact of the intensity of
this mission until Nimoy
looked at us cross-eyed
and said. "We are going:
(scary shark music) in
Search of Woody Pop-
Dcrl" (more scary shark
music)

For months ‘indccd.
the cry around campus
had been, “thrc's
Woody?!" Certainly it
sccmcd, ~that Woody
Popper. former SA
Vicc-Prcsidcnt was sorc-

heard,

1y missed in many
SUNYA social circles.
We, however. were on
the case. Our mission
took us to all corners of
the globe, from Niagra
to Montauk Point, frotn
Mcssina to Staten
island, indeed we did
camp out at every
Money Bank location.
We found ourselves on
Safaris in Africa and
dining on chccs blintzcs
at tltc royal palace in
Lichtenstein, a small
country south of
Monoco. owned by Abc
and Estcilc Lichtenstein
of Brooklyn. New York.
All too soon ltowcvcr,
Spring brcak was over.
and we had to return to
campus. sans Woody.
Tltc \vcathcr was star-
ting to warm up and our
crew was convening for it
strategy session on the
podiunt. Thc sun was
shining brightly turd in-
tlccd Albany was bcginn-
ing to look like
somewhere other than
Albany. Nimoy was
scribbling some notes
down on a pad. when
suddenly a giant shcct of
darkness fell over tltc
podium. It was as if so-
ntconc had plucked the
sun rigltt out of the sky.
A shadow literally
descended over the en-
tire campus. People
began looking all around
for answers to this
phenomcnom. Suddenly
We heard a girl shout.
“Look up there!"
Everyone pointed and
starcd. Lo and behold,
thcrc snt the "Wood-
man" himself, at tile top
of the cartcsian water
tower. his nose hanging
over the side. llil-
mctlintcly we rushcd the
tower. irttcrtt on bringing
Wome tlowu, alive and

intact. Suddenly, we saw
ltitn slithcring down the
side of the water tower.
Bcforc we could catch
him he ltad run all tltc
way over to the foun-
lnins in front of tile carn-
pus center. Hc might
have escaped too. had ltc
not rtrn into the in-
famous Roscntan! You

ly allergic to red ﬂowers
and its soon as ltc got
within inches of the
roses, he began sneezing.
'l'hc Roscman and all
passersby wcrc im-
mediately annihilntcd.
Seeing the mass destruc-
tion that he had causcd,
Wody naturally panick-
ed. In a single lcztp lie

sitting in tltc center of
tltc sprinkling fountains.

crouch. We run over and
t'ormcd a huge circle
around the fountains,
thwarting any furtltcr
cscapc plans that hc may
have had. We stood at a
classic stalcmntc.

“Come on Woody.
you’re all wet — it's ovcr
— you're washed up —

Nimoy. Woody slowly
pickcd his ltcud up.
stuck his tongue out.
and rcassumcd his initial
position. Within
seconds. SA President.
David Pologc was on the
scene. Nimoy [cut him
