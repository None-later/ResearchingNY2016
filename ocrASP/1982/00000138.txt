The two sophomores,

waiting for the “:05
elevator when. according
to witnesses. a mouse
“as big as a back-hoe"
charged out of the open-

woman under a fore-paw
and dashed down the
corridor.

“it was definitely a
mouse." said RA Elmer

before. it was as big as a
Volkswagen.”

"At first l thought it

Several students were

quate living ar-
rangements.

“You should see the
‘food' the
students leave for its to
eat! Potato chips,
chocolate chip cookies,
and beer! What kind of
a diet is that? Any mouse
would surely incur
serious nutritional defi-
ciencies." she said.
“And the housing ar-
rangements are equally
horrible. We have to live
under these dark, musty,
dirty beds. Tlte filth! I
swear some of the
students never even
clean under there."

The radical rodents
are demanding special

particular nutritional
needs. Unfortunately.
Munch pointed out, this
would not stop the chaos
which ensues when one
or mice sits down to din-
ner in Alden cafeteria.

“Such a ruckusl i
mean. this is i982! i sup-
pose some of these Long

seen a mouse before.
Well, they'll just have to
get used to the fact that
we do exist, and are en-
titled to the same rights
as they are,” Munch
said. “And (Alumni
Quad Director Liz) Rat-
co's been no help at all."

Ratco has responded
to the rodent’s demand
by suggesting a section
of one of the dorms be
allocated for the mice.
“_l‘ve been itearing a lot
of complaints about the
mice' activities from

i  ,

meal plans to 'meet their

graduate and
undergraduate students
alike," Ratco said.

- “Perhaps it is best we

just keep them
separated."

But SA attorney
Mickey Mishler, who
sympathizes with the
mice’ cause. charges that
such a policy would be
unconstitutional.

” ‘Separate but equal’
is nonetheless unequal."
Mishler said. “The mice
must be given the same

accomodations as the .

students."

Munch lamented that
segregation of mice front
students “would only in-
hibit inter-species
understanding." I

The mice' proposals
are pending approval
from Alumni Quad

they have some pretty
fair talent hidden away

just the Mets luck that
one of the Japanese

just may be available.
Rumor has it that Clem
Osaki. the ace huricr for

And those goons itave
got to be the stupidest
people in the entire
universe. They could get

ing football or 100 times
more playing baseball.
but those jcrks would
rather slide around and

What the NHL needs
is more black players.
Then maybe the game
would get a little classier
and move up to the level
of horse racing. Look
would it did for college
basketball.

"‘ On the local front.

Dick Sauers demoted
from men's basketball
coach at Albany State
to a gloriﬁed
duck may have larger
repercussions. Ford
reportedly enjoyed the
feeling of power and
similar moves may be
forthcoming.

Rumors were flying
around the athletic
department yesterday.
Several names were men-
tioned. but those most
likely to be shuffled
seem to be other coaches
with seniority at the
university. Men‘s track
coach Bob Munscy was a
possibility, moving
either to gymnastics or
women's tennis. Bill
Schieffelin. men's soccer
coach. is a candidate for
the basketball job
vacated by Saucrs, and
men's tennis coach Bob
Lewis may be the next
track coach.

And the women

coaches are not exempt
from Ford's \vrath. Ten-
nis coach l’cggy Mann is
being serious considera-
tion for the men's soccer
position. Lcc Rhenish
may give up softball for
tennis and Amy Kidder
might get a try as an
assistant football coach.
leaving behind women’s
soccer and basketball.

Some wild reports
even have an assistant
football coach being
