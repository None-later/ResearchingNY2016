face and all. will not be
back pacing tlte Dane
basketball bench next
season. Tlte Albany
State head basketball
coach abruptly announc-
ed his resignation yester-
day under enormous
heat from Atltletic
Director Robert Ford.
Ford apparently was not
pleased with tlte Dancs‘
horrendous performance
in tire SUNYAC tourna-
ment held last month in
which front-running
Albany collapsed lbsing
both games. .

“I cannot believe that
we were so embarassed
in Buffalo last month."
Ford. sounding very
much like fiery yankee
owner George Steinbren-
net. told the Post in an
exclusive'intcrview at his
ofﬁce this week. “I can
understand losing if l
feel that the team is try-
ing, but their play was
unforgivcable and un-
worghy of this fine
university."

Ford's harsh com-
ments drew immediate
reaction from Sauers.

who learned of them
upon his return from
New Orleans where he

‘had attended the Final

Four last weekend.
“What?." Stutch
roared. “Who does he
think he is. George

Ray Meyer doesn‘t have
to pttt tip with tltis at
DePauI and his teatn
always cltokcs. so why
should I? If he expects
me to stick around as
coach after tltis. he can

forgit it!" I

Sauer's resignation
marks an end of an era
at Albany that has lasted
27 years. His 448 vic-
tories make him the win-
ningcst active coach in
Division III.

“I gues he's done a
decent job." said center
.lohn Dicckeltnan. “l'm
sorry to see him go."

Other Danes express-
ed relief in Sauer's
resignation.

“You know I can't
shoot as well as JD
can.” said one player
who asked to remain
nameless. "Now ill miss
a few key shots. I won't
have to see Doc's angry
face. I hope they find a

replacement who knows a

how to smile."

A possible replace-
ment for Sauer's job
could be long time team
manager. Biff Fischer.

“It‘s about titne they

the crap I do around
here. after all I should
have graduated at year
and a half ago." said
Fischer.

Luckily. ltowevcr.
Sauers will not totally be
leaving the Albany
sports scene. Rather. he
has decided to remain on
the Great Dane coaching
staff as head coach of
the Synchronized

THE COMPETITION
was fierce. but alas the
20 members of the Dane
Bus Bandits have been
selected. Albany State’s
newest c'oed squad, led
by bus —— driver coach
Chuck Williman, has
been hitting the road
daily in preparation [for
its first cross country
tournament on April 10.

The team tryout, held
last Saturday, was a test
of the applicant's
maneuverability.
squsltability, and speed.
Willitnan. known far
attd wide for his grcttt
sense of humor. cxplaith
ed the day's events as “a
sight for sore bodies."

Mancuverbility.
perhaps the most highly
regarded skill in bus
riding today, was the
first basis on which a
Bandit was chosen. The
knowledge of “door
riding” and how to be
“crude and rude" were

  

some cues used by
Williman in the deciSion
making process.

The coach added that
“cheap forms of
mancuvcrbility. such as
yelling that there was
another bus coming. was
severely frowned upon.”

A Wellington bound
vehicle packed with
passengers set the scene
for the squshability exer-
cise. Ten contestants at a
time were required to
somehow enter and
secure a spot on the
already overloaded bus.

    
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
 
 
 

They then had to remain
standing for the entire
trip down to the hotel.
Assistant . Coach Bill
“Smiley” Dixon, who
supervised this particular
phase of the recruiting.
was extremely excited
with what he saw. “My
motto ‘nevcr leave a stu-
dent strandcd' took on
more meaning than ever
before." said Dixon.
Speed. a must-
credential for a Bandit to
possess. was the final
means of evaluation.
The athlete would see

 

the bus pull away [from
the Social Science stop.
and would have to run to
the circle stop before

‘Williman would take off

en route‘ to downtown.

Now that the grueling
tryout is over. and the
team members have been
picked. the repeated
question presented to
Willitnan is why this
tough contact sport was
made coed? Although
the coach of 29 plus
years of age refused to

Thousands of protestors from all
parts of the country gathered in
Washington on Saturday to take
part in a rally against the U.S.
policy toward El Salvador.

The sponsors of the demonstra-
tion. The March 27 Coalition.
estimate that 50.000 people showed
up for the rally. More conservative
estimates claim that the turnout was
closer to 30.000.

Although the political
philosophies of the demonstrators
were extremely diverse. most felt
that Reagan is spending to much
money on an unjust war and too lit-
tle to combat domestic problems.

Protestors chanted. “Money for

jobs. not for war. U.S. out of El
Salvador." Many of the posters
carried had similar slogans; "Peo-
ple not guns." “Jobs not war." and
“Bread not bombs." one poster
said. “$300 million spent in El
Salvador means l2.50l murders.
$300 million spent at home means
38.879 jobs."

The rally began in Malcom X
Park at about “:00 am. '

Most of the people who showed
tip at the rally were young and
politically to tile left of center
although tlterc was also many older
people. some of whom brottght
their children. One group showed
up with peace signs and slogans
brightly painted on their faces.

Almost all of those present were

 
 
   

strongly anti-Reagan. Many
chanted. “Ronald Reagan. he's no
good. send him back to
Hollywood." One protestor carried
a banner which turned Reagan‘s
own rhetoric against him; "Get the
government off the backs of the
people of El Salvador.” I

One woman who came from
South Philadelphia toparticipate in
the rally supported Reagan but was
against having to send her children
to war. "We 'don‘t go marching."
she said. .“We're red. white and
blue Americans. we pttt a flag out
on Memorial Day. I‘d rather ttot be
here bttt its necessary. I wouldn’t
want my kids to be here. I want
them to have clean records."

She carried a poster with a pic-

ture of each of her children taped
on it. “I havejttst spend $2.000 puts
ting braces on my older boy." she
said pointing to his picture. "I
don't want to have to send him to
war."

The Catholic Church was well
reprcsentcd at the rally although
there was a great diversity of views
among its members who were pre-
sent. One group was giving out a
socialist newspaper called the
“Catholic Worker" wltile others
merely objected to thc.slaughter of
Catholic clergy in El Salvador.

The Church officially favors a
political solution bill as one film
from Detroit said. "I came on my
own because I had to, not as a
member of the Church. I didn't

t} ‘ Thousands Protest.U.S Policy onEl Salvador '

bother asking what my superiors
thought of that. lJust came.”

Also present at the demonstra-
tion was a group of Palestinian
students. One commented that “El
Salvador is just another front for
the battle we are ﬁghting." He
pointed out that Israel is the second
largest supplier of arms to El
Salvador and a major arms supplier
to other right-wing Central
American governments as well as
South Africa.

Nearby a group of Zionists were
giving out a leaflet entitled
“Zionists against Imperialism." In
response to the comments tnade by
the Palestinians. one Zionist said.

The Rhetoric and CommunicationstRCO) department will be the
only department in the College of Humanities and Fine Arts to suffer
stuff cutbacks if the anticipated $2.2 million in budget cuts is passed.

“There's a rumor that Humanities will be cut before anything else,
Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts .lohn Shumaker said. “But, it isn't
true. Humanities hasn‘t been singled out."

According to Shumaker.there are 18 tentatively vacant position in
Humanities now. but most of them will be filled by next semester.

“If the campus loses 60 positions. sotne of our positions would go.
But it’s impossible to say right now how many. We have to wait until
April when the budget is announced" he said.

Besides Rec 100. 212. 330. 355 and 465K. the only other Humanities
course slated for the budget axe is a Psychology in Literature course..

Shumaker explained that the teacher of the course. Professor Fred
Beharriel. is needed to teach German. as he was hired to do.

“We are trying to cut the smaller courses. if any." he said. “I want.
to leave the general education courses alone."

However Neil Sal'l'cr. Chairper-
son ol' the Central Finance Commit-

of tltc allegations expressed at the
press conference.

Bonnick's allegations stem. in
part. from l’CA's attempts To
secure Michael Manley. former
pritttc minister of Jamaica and ad-
vocate of Third World unity. to
speak on campus. Bonnick said tltc
Speakers Fortttn rejected the re-
quest due to lack of money and
claimed the “proposal had been
misplaced."

“In addition." he said. “shabby
rationales were given for not
holding the event this setnestcr.
such as tltcrc are too tnatty other
events that week. like Mayfcst. and
that it’s too close to finals."

“Everybody who goes to tile
Finance Cotntnitlce gets treated ex-
actly the same way." Suffer stated.
"It‘s an impartial. unbiased com-
tnittee that tries to do the best thing
per dollar. per person.“ I

Speakers Forum President Matt
Landau could not be reached for
comment.

ASUBA chairperson Donna

I Wltitc also said she found "several

problems with Speakers Forum in
the past year."

“The Black Alliance has tried to
bring up numerous speakers and
out attempts have run into a white
concrete wall." she said. “Our rc-

groups are asking for more money
than last year." he ttdded.

Woll‘son described the budget
process as. “very fair. We go
tltrough it line by line. look at what
organizations tlld last year and what
they're planning to do this year.“

Pologc said approximately IO
members were selected for tltc cont—
tniltcc ottt of 20 applicants.

"The chairman assigns it or 9
budgets to each Cotntnittec person

member. Cathy l.asusa.

In addition. Wltite charges at-
tempts to schedule newscaster Gil
Noble. and attempts to re-schednlc
Dr. Charles King. after his speaking
engagement was cancelled. were
met with rudeness and contempt by
Speakers Forum.

“These actions clearly
demonstrate that black speakers
aren't worth as much as white
speakers. and that black speakers
aren’t recognized as being impor-

tanl enough to speak in front 'of a -

white audience." she said.

White also stated that black
stttdcttts are continually forced to
“beg” for money which they had
been told was already designated to
them by last year's budget.

She added. “It is apparent that
our fellow classmates are following
in the steps of their forefathers. by
