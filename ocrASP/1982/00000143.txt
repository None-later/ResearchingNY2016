lf yott want to remetnber
something, try sleeping on it. ||-
linois Health Department officials
say students who go to sleep right
after studying ltave much better
recall than those who stay up later.
The researchers say nobody knows
why sleep should improve memory.
bttl they think it cottld be because.
when you’re asleep. new ex-
periettecs can't interfere with what
you just learned.

slow down

The 55-Milc—an-hottr speed limit
is a step iii the rigltt direction. bttt a
California titan says it doesn't go
far enough. John Loudermilk ltas
begun a campaign to lower the
limit to 15 miles ttn hour. with the
motto ‘lnseets have rights, too.‘
Loudermilk heads a (i-hundred
member organization called 'Not-

control, as well as a ban on all
children‘s games-because they lead
to gambling. He says the sugges-
tions are to make the point that the
government is passing too many
laws and regulations. 'Good inten-
tions.’ he says, 'don‘l necessarily
make good laws.‘

mr. dog

Plans to market a French peri'une
for pampered pooches have Illil
afoul of federal regulations. The
perl'ttme--called ‘Monsicttr ('hien.‘
or ‘Mr. Dog‘-~was to have been sold
at high class pet stores in Beverly
Hills and Palm Springs. littt when a
dogfight broke out with customs
agents over whether it was a
veterinary producl or a cosmetic
one. the importer got offended and
pulled oal of the deal.

russian pot ‘

Despite official claims to the con-
trary. the word from the Soviet
Union is that authorities there are
worried about the increasing of
‘ANASHA.’ That‘s marijuana to
you. And it‘s been showing up in
Moscow and other Soviet cities.,
along with sizable quantities of
llashish smuggled itt by Soviet
soldiers in Afghanistan. Besides
risking prison terms of up to five
years for possesion. Russian pot-
smokers also have to contend wiIlt
high prices; A ntatclthux of hash
costs more than a month's salary
for an industrial worker and a single
joint costs at least a dollar-fifty.

business void

While student enrollment in
business schools is expanding. the,
number of faculty members
available to teach them is shrinking.

The American Assembly of Col-
legiate Schools of Business reports
that one out of every five teaching
posts is empty. And long-range pro-
jections indicate the problem will
get even worse. The report blames
the professor shortage on the in-
creased emphasis on research over
teaching.

cat juggle

if cat-juggling ever becomes a na-
tional menace. John Keefe is ready
to say ‘l told you so.‘ The Min-
nesota State Senator interrupted a
debate on an animal protection hill

and juggling ‘ them.’ He later
withdrew the proposal. admitting
he'd never heard of the practice ac-
tually taking place. But, he warned
his colleagues. ‘lf you're not
against cat juggling. it means you’re
for it.’

mash ed tv

 

Get smart kids  and watch
M‘A ‘S'H on television. A survey
3y the California Department of
Education revealed that school
:ltildren who watched M‘A‘S'H
were higher achievers than those
who didn't. But aside from that. the
study supported a link between
ltcavy TV watching and poor
grades. .
