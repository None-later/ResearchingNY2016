DeMeo. “No coach, no matter how
good he is, can have a successful
team without great athletes."

However. the term “great
athletes" has more meaning to tltc
mentor than the apparent face
value. “What i look for is not
always the best wrestler. Because
the best wrestler is like the prettiest
girl — a lot of people are after lter.
There might be better girls that are
not so pretty. their might be better
wrestlers (which fit our needs) that
are not the best," analogized
DeMeo.

Of great importance to tire coach
is to find tltose grapplers wlto can

the athlete, therefore the wrestler
must have those qualities which fit

good facilities, good technique.
good coaching. the allotted amount
of money — all of that goes into the
system." said DeMeo.

after it's over. in between they (the

Not only does DeMeo feel that
the Dane wrestlers can handle the
pain next season, ire foresees his
squad as “contenders for the na-
tional title next year."

Men ’3 Tennis Ready For Success

Ily MICHAEL DINOWITZ

 

Although you may not know it.
spring is here. and the Albany
States Mcns Varsity tennis team is
ready to embark on a new season of
hard played tennis.

SUNYAC Champions three times
iii a row, the squad. which is lead by
Coach Bob Lewis, is hopeful of
repeating their past successful per-
formanccs.

The veteran Danes who are tttadc
up of mostly soplrrrtor'cs and juniors
has, according to Lewis, “been
working hard in the past wcck. have
a good team attitude, and feel ready
for their first match."

The upcoming week will be filled
with challenge matches, although
the starting line-up looks solid at
this time. It is basically the same
line-up that accumulated an im-
pressive 5-l record last fall.

The fully returning \‘Clclttil team
have an impressive variety of in-
dividuals, who have domittatcd it]
the SUNYAC conference tcccntly.
Leading the troupe it. first singles
player Barry Levine (JR), who has
held the spot for two full years.
chinc is ranked 35th nationally in
Div lll singles. and along with part-
ner Fred Gaber (JR). has attained
the ranking of ill irt Div lll doubles,

The rrtrrnbcr two singlcs player is
Dave Ulrich (SO). Ulrich also plays
doubles with Dave Lcrrtcr and
together are giving stifl' cotrrpctitiott
to the number one pttit.

Fred Gaber (JR) looks like he will
be playing irt iltc nrttrtbcr iltrcc spot.
(iabcr ltas been the SUNYAC
Champ in his respective flight for
the past three years. The rutntbcr
four spot belongs to Rob Karen
(50). Karen also has been a
SUNYAC Champ for two years.

Dave Lerner (R), the fifth
singles player also has the honor of
being a SUNYAC Champion for
three years.

Rounding out the squad is Russ
Kasow (SO) who should be playing
in the number six position, and An-
dy Diamond (JR) returning after
missing a full season for personal
reasons. Diamond is trying to break
into tltc line-up, but may iravc a
tough litnc because of his absence
last fall.

One of iltc goals of the squad will
be to send representatives to tire
NCAA tournament which will he
held in Kalamtwoo, Michigan. The
Danes have sent representatives for
iltc past couple of years and hope to
repeat this feat in tire rrpcorrting
season. Levine has been at tile
tourney for the last two years. The
team aspires to scttd two singles
players. and one doubles team. Art
invitation for the whole team scents
unlikely.

()n the whole the outlook for
Albany seems quite positive. Their
main strength according to Coach
Lewis is “excellent balance". while
their top weakness ltas been “I'in-
(lng a good.solid third doubles
learn."

The tcattr will face a tough

schedule in the \pring bccttttsc of
tire Dual Match \cltcdttlc, they must
take on in tltc spring. ('lrallertgcs in-
clttdc such schools as Colgate, ('or-
ncll. and \’ctrttont. as well its tough
conlcrcncc competition. llut as the
season rolls around iltc Danes are
hitting into shape and scent ready to
take on all comers.
