ALBANY STUDENT PRESS SDOI'IS MARCHISO, 1982.
y Bows in the Finals

At the Binghamton Challenge Cup, 4-2

By MICHAEL CARMEN

After five hard fought ﬂoor
hockey contests. the Albany State
entry fortnd themselves pitted
against a determined Binghamton l
squad in the finals of the-Bingham-
ton Challenge Cup.

Binghamton played two fewer
games and “had been waiting
around" for the semifinal game to
end. The boys from SUNYA were
able to stay with the Binghamton l

teatrr through the first period. but
Albany who was obviously tired
allowed their opponents to pull
away and record a 4-2 Binghamton
Victory.

Albany reached the finals by
posting a 2-0-l division mark and
defeating the Binghamton Altttnni
4-3 in their semi-final match.

Scott Segal. Albany co-eaptain
along with Andy Weirrstock was
disappointed about the loss and the
officiating.

 

 

 

 

 

The Albany intramural hockey season is coming to a close as- the top eon-

lcnders vye for playoff sports in tireir respective divisions. The end of the

hockey season will mark the conclusion of Indoor Intramuruls. Softball and
soccer action will commence this weekend. (l’holo: Amy Cohen)

In tlte first game ttgainst i" L
ton ll we had l2 straight penalties
called against as opposed to none
for them". stated Scott Segal. "We
practically played the entire tourna-
ment short-handed."

In the finals. the first period cnd-
ed scoreless due partly to the
goaltendng ol' Albany's Ste\cn
Diprcssi, “He stopped tlrtcc shots
that eteryone in the gym was sure
that they were in the net“. praised
Segal.

The Albany scoring machine.
which recorded l7 goals in their
plt.‘\lt)tl‘s games, was ne\et able to
get rrnttaek‘ed. l’ete l’etrillo and Ar-
thur I’tessman added goals in the
final. htrt it “as not enough.

In the preceding contests. Albany
had help from Robert Richter (four
goals). Wolfson (three goals).
Richard Westctherg (four goals).
l)a\c Silvernrarr. (‘arl Wolfson, and
lloh Miller.

Segal also claimed that the rules
were considerably different—there
were no ol'l'sides atrd no icing. Also,
the games were played with plastic
stickes atrd a red street hockey hall.

Despite some ohrions athersitics
Albany still played in the totals.
Segal also noted strong defense as a
reason for their success. Keith lit-
wak. Steve Weinrih. Neil l.a|er.
Mark Buckley. Mark McDonald,
Rich Car'dillo. and Don llonen
were the commended back players.

Albany State will hold their tr\\tt
Challenge Cup ort'May l. ('elelrra-
tiorr 'KZ weekend. So lets all go out
artd show tberrr our support,

"We‘re not going to be denied
again". added Segarl.

Steve, Mike. Bob. and Biff never bothered to ask me my opinion,
but i knew deep down that everyone was wondering who lnny liked

corrre out victorious, even though my heart bleeds for Dean Smith (l '

swear i wrote this before the game). Next year thoscguys will pro-
bably beg me for my pick; i think l‘ll play hard to get.
