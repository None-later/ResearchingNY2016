’Tarheels-Nip GeorgetoWn In NCAA Final, 63-62

N W ORLEANS, La. (AP) Freshman Michael Jordan
hit an 18-foot jumper with 15 seconds left and James
.Worthy won the duel of dunks with Patrick Ewing to
give North Carolina its first NCAA basketball cham.
pionship under Coach Dean Smith with a 63-62 victory
over Georgetown Monday night.

Worthy scored a career-high 28
points and his steal. coming oii a
giveaway pass from Georgetown‘s
Fred Brown with l0 seconds left. in-
sured North Carolina the national
title and finally lifted the monkey
from Smith's back.

The North Carolina coach had
taken six previous teams to the
Final Totir and came tip empty-
handed each time. but this iitnc it
was Worthy, Sam Perkins and Jor-
dan who delivered the champion-
ship trophy into the hands ol‘Smitli
in his 21st season as coach of the
Tar Heels.

The battle betwceit the front litre
of North Carolina — (Moot-9
junior Worthy and 6-9 sophomore
Perkins — and the 7.t'oot
Georgetown monolith. Ewing. pro-
duced one of the closest title games
iii recent history.

Not since l959 had there been an
NCAA championship decided by
one point. California won that title

 

by beating West Virginia 7l-70. brit
the past 22 title games have. for the
most part. been blowouts. '

This game was undecided until
the very end. Eric "Sleepy" Floyd
had given Georgetown a 62-6! lead
when he worked into the lane rind
fired up a lO—t'ooter with 57 seconds
to play.

North Carolina. already in a
slowdown for the past four
minutes. called tiiiie oitt with 32
seconds left, then worked the ball
around the perimeter anti .lortlati
threw up the game-winner from the
left side.

As Georgetown brottglit the bull
down court. Brown turned to his
right and tossed the hall itito Wor-
thy's hands. Worthy then lreatlcd
toward the Georgetown basket. and
was intentionally fouled by liric
Smith with two seconds remaining.
Worthy missed two t‘oul shots. but
the victory had been settled.

Smith. critici/ed as a coach who

couldn't win the "big one," ﬁnally
ended all that talk. As fans and
photographers swarmed onto iht
court, first Worthy, then the coach.
were lifted onto teammates'
shoulders to begin the traditional
cutting down of the net at the Lotti-
siana Superdome. where a crowd in
excess of 6| .000 watched for the se-
cond time in the past three days.

Smith finally won the champion-
ship with ti team that had perhaps
the best starting five of his carcol
arid compiled a record of 32-2. hi:
best at North Carolina.

“I'm very grateful to my players.
We played probably the best team
we've seen all year, along with
Virginia." said Smith.

The loss ended Georgetown's
best season ever with a 30-7 record,
but the Hoyas were foiled in their

I first cliatirpiorrsliip gainc‘since l943
when they lost 46-34 to Wyoming.

No more than four points
separated the two teams in the se-
eoird half and Jordan's winning
basket produced the ninth lead
change of the half.

.lordaii said his gtriiic-winniiig
.sliot cutiie on “set play. If I had ati
open sliot, coach said ‘Go ahead
and take it.‘ "

 

 

Georgetown‘s Patrick Ewing made the NCAA finals close. However.

North Carolina was the victor, 63-62.

Joe DeMeo: The Complete Wrestling Coach

By MARK GESNER

lf Joe DcMco was a toy doll, the
manufacturing company would
have him put in a neat. organized.
well wrapped little package. The
Albany State men's varsity wrestl-
ing coach puppet would have no
loose ends and no extra parts.
Naturally. the toy would be a big
seller. '

§PORT§ F€ATUR€

Although DeMeo is admittedly
no doll, and is far from being
anybody‘s ptrppct, he does come
close to ﬁtting the model of the
complete coach. The man of 40 is
proud of where he has been. and
enthusiastic about where he is go-
ing.

The fun began in high school
when DeMco's football coach (who
also just happened to be the
school‘s wrestling coach). suggested
to the M7 pounder: "Why don't
you come out for wrestling? it will
help your football."

Little did that Mont Pleasant
High coach know that he started a
new way of life for the young
DeMeo. The grappler went
undefeated in high school dual
meets, won two Section ll cham~
pionships, and captured the YMCA
state high school title.

College also yielded only goou
results. A three year varsity letter-
man at Cornell. the wrestler lost but
one dual meet in his time there.

A I964 U.S. Olympic team alter-
nate and a national freestyle champ
in I966 were two additional creden-
tials for DeMeo.

While still training on a national
level, he began his coaching career
at Michigan State in l967. After
three years as assistant in Michigan,
DeMeo spent seven years as head
coach at Stanford University, and
then ﬁnally felt it was time to come
back home to the East.

.loc (iarcia. Albany State wrestl-
ing coach for 27 years. had
recruited 'DeMco in high school.
The two stayed in touch over the
years. and Garcia ot‘t':red the Stan-
ford coacli air assistant position in
l977. Five years after that offer
Coach DeMco runs the Daire
wrestling program. He has
developed a mediocre team into
something not far short of a
powerhouse. A l7-3-l record in the
l98l—82 season was the State grap-
piers' best ever.

DeMeo discussed some of the
causes for the turn around that has
been oceuring in Albany wrestling.
“it's been a combination of things.
We have gotten better athletes who
have had more experienCe. In the
past we have always had a couple of

 

) ‘54“

good wrestlers. lint it takes more
than a couple to make a team. This
year we had a team of good

wrestlers."

The coach surely had a team full
of good wrestlers. however, he also
had a few great wrestlers. Andy

Seras, Spero Theofiiatos. and Dave
Averill were each Division III All-
Amcricans for Albany. Seras and
9.9%“

 

SUNYAC champions.

What is it that helps make that
transition front good to great? “It's
psychological more than anything
else.“ began DeMeo. "Take a guy
like Spero who has always had a lot
of physical talent iii terms of speed
and power. This year he took that
speed and power. and piit it into tiit
right psychological framework. He
was able to beat a two time All-
Amcrican in the semi-finals of the
SUNYACS."

DeMeo's theory of success in
wrestling is closely intertwined with
his theory ofsuccess in life. "if you
know how to be successful in
school. than you know how to be
successful in wrestling. The ingre-
dients to success are always the
same,” said the coach in a recent in-

Two time All-American Andy Sens is on top of his opponent. Wrestling

terview over a chinese lunch. “in
this dish right here there are onions,
cabbage. etc. lfyou take those satire
things and mix them up in a dif-
ferent way. you have a different
dish. but still it's the same ingre-
dients."

Mr. DeMeo. the business inan, is
quick to refer to the importance of
his life outside of wrestling. As a

stock broker at the local Paine

 

Webber insurance company. he has
the ﬂexibility to handle his two
jobs. in fact. one reason why the
coach-broker claims to be such a
happy tiian is because of the
balance that he enjoys. “it makes

‘ me, Joe DeMeo. with my make-up

better wrestling coach."

Although DeMeo‘s two occupa-
tions seem to have no relationship
on the surface. the prophetic middle
aged man explains the tie, “Win-
ners are winners. The same people
who win in business win in sports.
The same people who win iii sports
win in business. They win in
love. . . You know, they‘re win-
ners!"

Although the coach sees lriirrseil
as pretty much of a winner. he does
acknowledge that he lacks some vir-

     

tues iii particular areas. “It would
probably be nice il' l was a little
smarter. if I understood people bet-
ter," began DeMeo. “Coaching is u
ftrriiiy thing. you try to do,wliat is
right for the kids. Now. iii a given
situation it sometimes is to yell at
them. deceive theirr. arid other times
it‘s to put different kinds of subtle
or moral group pressure on tiictii.
You never really are going to know
what will work until afterwards."

One fault that DeMco doesn't see
with himself is iii his ability to
rccrtiit. With the help of his assis—
tant coach Mike Paquette et al,
Albany trys to home in on the few
kids that will fill iii the gaps on the
Dane squad.

Administration Slashes Hours

By LIZ REICH

Approximately l,500 students
angered over the elimination of
daytime access to computer ter-

The adtnitiistration ciit the hours
during which students may use the
computers from 8 run. — 5 a.ni.. to
9 pm. - 5 a.tn. because they ran otrt

that when the adtiiinistration‘s

requested additional funds for tire

By the time the $75.00() iii addi-

Jim Tierney.

Calling Carey's original budget
