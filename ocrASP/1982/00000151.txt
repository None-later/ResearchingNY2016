Students Are Most Sensitive

BETHESDA. MD (CPS) Biology
lab, according to the Consumer
Product Safely Commission. may
be hazardous to your health.

The commission, in a new report,’
. said formaldehyde levels in 26 ltigh

school and college biology labs it
surveyed were high enough "to
catise adverse health effects" on the
students and faculty members who
work in the labs.

“Students,” the reports added.
“because ol‘ their age and stage of

development. may be more sensitive
than the general population to the
irritant, allergic and sensitization
effects. and may be at a higher risk
of developing cancer from exposure
to formaldehyde."

The commission said it will now
work with science teachers and lab
technicians to form guidelines for
keeping ventilation adequate and

even lessening the amount of for—‘

maldchyde used to preserve lab
specimens. -

Emery Pledges To BoostEconomy'

By MARK HAMMOND

New York State Assemblyman
and Republican Gubernatorial
nominee James Emery described
New York State as being “like a
champion out of shape" and blam-
ed Governor Carey’s “economy-be-
dainncd policy" in a campaign
speech Tuesday afternoon in the
Assembly Hall.

Emery, who‘is now Minority
Leader of the Assembly, swore to
abandon his Assembly Seat with
"no reservations" in a campaign ef-
fort to win the Republican Guber-

natorial nomination‘ovcr 'Lconard
Lchrman and Richard Roscnbaum.

Emery spoke to a crowd of ap-
proximately 50 people, promising
to revitalize New York’s lagging
economy. revamp the State
Legislature and restore the death
penalty in a “new era of crime pro-
tection." I

Saying his prime concern was
“the disastrous economy." he pro-
posed a $3.5/billion plan for tax
redtiction over the next five years.
hoping to’ reduce unemployment
and keep the “talented young peo-
ple" in New York.

He also proposed extending
legislative terms from two years to
four. hoping to allow more time for
government and eliminate
“love-in" election years when
“cvcryonc‘s smiling and nothing
gets done."

Emery feels that the current
legislature has “neglected the State
University‘s real needs," and

faulted the "gross deficiencies in‘

the tax system" for this.
“i will not stand by and watch

the dismantling of the State Univer- .

sity system," he pronilscd.

‘ Studies of formaldehyde levels on
the SUNYA campus have shown
that the air in the biology depart-
ment is fairly clear.

According to a report done last
semester the concentration level of
formaldehyde is well below the
standards set by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA). The research was done in
the Functional Morphology lab
where studies of animal physiology
are conducted. The study was done
as a safety check at the request of
Professor Helen Ghiradclla who is
in charge of safety at the biology
laboratories.

 .1 SL‘WYA Air Is Sdfe T0 Breathe

However. some students using

he labs have reported that if one
went into lab with an open cut, then
it could hurt after being exposed to
'ormaldchyde.
‘ The study was‘conducicd by Lisa
Donahue. Chemical Sal‘er Ofﬁcer
of SUNYA. Her report showed on~
ly .5 ppm (parts per minute) of for-
maldehyde were present in the same
air in which students conduct ex-
periments. OSHA regulations allow
up to three ppm.

Students are usually in a biology
laboratory for up to three hours a
week. Thc’study showed that the «
most anyone complains ol‘ is occas-
sionallredness oi the eyes and chap-
ped hands.
