‘ ~ Foreign Stude

(CPS) On a February day at the
University of Michigan's Engineer-
ing and Transportation Library,
Head Librarian Maurita Holland

happened to notice two men in ‘

overcoats surveying the urea. Soon
enough. the two men pulled her
aside, identified themselves as FBI
agents, and asked about the reading
habits of one of the library's regular
patrons: visiting Soviet Prof.
Vladimir Malyshko.

Holland refused to tell. citing
library policy.

At about the same time, the US.
Department of State was informing
Stanford Chaplain Phil Wicgc it
wouldn't let Soviet arms control ex-
pert Yuri Kaprolov visit the campus
because a “reciprocity agreement"
with the USSR had recently collaps- -
ed.

The incidents are among the most
recent in a series that has brought
American scholars into a direct con-
frontation with the Reagan ad-
minstration over once-routine ex-
changes of academicians with com-
munist countries.

The government. pursuing a hard
foreign policy line against the
Soviet Union, is trying to apply the
same import-export restrictions of
the exchange of knowledge between
nations as it applies to products like
automobiles. technology and
weaponry.

in the process, it has had the FBI
increase its surveillance of foreign
scholars and students on American
campuses.

Educators, on the other hand.
are getting angricr and angricr
about wltat they see as a dangerous
inhibition not only of academic ex-
change. but free speech.

:“lt's unfortunate that in a land

'where we value freedom of speech,

we're being inhibited by the State
Department from free and open
discussion." Stanford's Wicgc
lamented. -

“I used to cooperate (with
government guidelines for foreign
visitors)." added Michigan
aerospace cnginccr Charles" Kaul‘f—
man. who has hosted many Soviet
scholars, “but now I don't
Cooperate."

“I’m very angry at what our
govclnmcnt is doing," he explain-
ed. "The Reagan administration is
paranoid. anti the FBI has damn
ncttr bccomc tt Gestapo. There‘s a
very real problem llL‘l‘C."

The “problem,” in fact, is na-
tionwide. Since the start of the
1981-82 school year:

> The State Department tried to
restrict the freedom of Russian
robotoics cxpcrl Nickolai Umnov’s
visit to Stanford, Wisconsin, Ohio
Sttttc and Auburn this spring.

> The State Department tried to
keep Soviet organic chcmist
Mikhail Gololobov from seeing cer-
tain kinds of nutrition rcscarch
while visiting Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology.

> The University of Minnesota

ALBANY STUDENT Pness APRIL 2 1982

“'53 Under FFI'Sut‘veillanee‘Eye?'

tain academic areas.

> After discovering FBI at-
tempts to investigate Polish pro-
fessors visiting Iowa State Universi-
ty. ISU found the FBI was keeping
an eye on foreign students, blacks
and feminists at l5 different Iowa
campuses.

“We occasionally do find it
necessary to maintain survelliance"
of visiting scholars and foreign ex-
change students. said FBI
spokesman Wiley Thompson.

The decision t‘p watch them
“depends on a number of cir-
cumstances," Thol pson pointed
out. adding he can’t elaborate on
what those circumstances might be.

The State Deparfment maintaln-
ed it is placing essentially the same
restrictions it always has on
foreigners on American campuses.

“In terms of the export/import
control act." said a department
spokesman, “the transfer of
technology by oral or visual means

 

‘is covered." The more vigorous use

Ito enforce them. 

 

of the act to control knowledge ex-
changes stems from a ‘ “more
heightened awareness" of
technology as a :weapon.

The National Academy of
Sciences (NAS), which sponsors
many trips by American and Rus-
sian acndemicia s to each others‘
countries, agr that the State
Department is using the "same
guidelines that have been used for
years," according to NAS
spokeswoman Barbara Jorgcnson.

The difference.) she said. is that
the government is becoming harsher
in applying the restrictions, and ex-
pecting the universities themselves

‘The NAS is now "actively
negotiating" with the State Depart-
ment for a long-term solution. but
educators themselves seem less than
anxious to compromise.

‘ “We won’t impose limitations on
our visitors," msbrted Ohio State
Vice Presidcn‘ Edward M.
Crawford. “If they come, they are

free to come and go here."

Government restrictions on
visiting scholars are “so outrageous
as to be incredible," M.I.T. said in
an official response to the
Gololobov incident.

Academic freedom. the educators
agree, must be absolute. “The
backdrop of restricting someone's
access to learning doesn’t fit in the
university's framework." said John
Heise. director of the International

‘ Center at Michigan.

The State Department contends
colleges are blowing the problem
out of proportion, especially the
Unmov tour. I

Rot every Umnov case, the
department spokesman said,
“there'rc probably 70 or-'80 cases
approved, and life goes on. With
Umnov. the universities elected to
go to the mat with the
government.“ I

The universities have won most
of the wrestling matches so far.
“The FBI has backed off" in

 

demanding to see what foreigners
are reading at Michigan, Helses
reported.

Iowa State President W. Robert
Parks and Minnesota President C.
Peter McGrath both refused to
cooperate with the government's cf-
forts to restrict foreigners there.

Stanford President Donald.Ken-
nedy's refusal to enforce resrictlons
on robotics expert Umnov has put_
the Russian’s spring tour on hold
for the moment. ,

Another Russian robotics expert
-'- along with researchers . from
France. Yugoslavia and China -—
has been working at Stanford since,

_ September. without, government in-

terference,'according to the Stan-
ford News Service.

Besides tending to their research.
the visitors mostly "want to know
whether Calvin Kleins or Levis are
going to be ‘in' next year." Stan-
ford Prof. Bernard Roth said.
“that's what they're interested in:
jeans." ‘
