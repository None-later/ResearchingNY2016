trained rats

The army is looking for a few
good rats . . . to sniff out explosvic
booby traps and warn their
handlers of the impending danger.
According to a report in the Armed
Forces Journal International. wires
are implanted in the brains of
specially bred male albino mice.
and their pleasure centers are
stimulated wltcnevcr they correctly
identify the smell of TNT. in war-
time, the magazine says. the trained
rats would be carried in briefcase-
like contraptious. with a fan blow-
ing air throttglt their cages.
Whenever ttn animal detected TNT,
its brainwaves would trigger an
alarm. warning that a mine or
booby trap was near.

band'boom

 

Marching bands are still a big
ticket item in Washington. The
Reagan administration rttised a few t‘
eyebrows last year when, while cut- 3
ting the budget of the national en-
dowment for the arts. it increased
spending for military bands by to
million dollars. to more than 92
million. The White House won that
binge and this year is proposing '
ano‘her 3 million dollar hike in the
band budget. "

one good turn

The Reagan administration,
figuring one good bail-out deserves
another, has asked Chrysler Chair;
mart Lee lacocca, who won hefty
federal loatt guarantees for his com-
pany. to raise money to bail ottt
Ellis island. The National Park Ser-

arrival facility in New York could
need more titan IOO million dollars
worth of restoration. lacocea. the
son of ltalian immigrants. reported-
ly "is eager to take on the
challenge."

sickening kids

if an elderly relative tells you.
“You make Inc sick.“ they may
mean it. A Duke University
psychiatrist says elderly people fre-
quently become hypochondriaes
because of problems with family
members. Ewald Busse says some
elderly people “get sick“ to avoid
the nagging of their children and ‘
grandchildren or to punish,
themselves for feeling hostile
towards their loved ones. He says ;
about one-third [use their symp-;
touts when they move nutty from

crackdown. undercover agents will
be prowling video stores in
Philadelphia during the next couple
of months searching for illicit tapes.
“Before. we had always gone after
the big dealers.” say Morton Fry, a
spokesman for Warner Home
Video in New York. “Now. we're
going after the retailers.” The video
industry also has introduced a bill
in Congress that would make video
cassette piracy a felony and hike the
penalty to a maximum of five years
behind bars and $250,000 in fines.

tight money

Tight money is convincing more
taxpayers than ever to withhold
their annual Checks to the ms. and
keep the money until the govern-
ment demands it. At the current
rate about is million taxpayers will
fill out returns this year. but neglect
to include their tax payments.
That’s a 20 percent increase over
last year. and a problem that's
made worse by antiquated [RS
computers, which take months to
even identify the delinquent tax-
payers. But the tax collectors even-
tually do catch tip with just about
everybody —- and when they do
they can get nasty. grabbing homes
and closing businesses in a matter
of days. “They don't care wht the
facts are,” says one accountant,
"they just want their money."

silly lord

The image of British Parliamen-
tarians as stodgy conservatives went
up in smoke recently when a
member of the House of Lords pro-
posed legalizing‘marijuana and ad-
mitted smoking it himself. The
34-yearlold Marquess of Tweedale
told his colleagues he‘s taken a few
tokes at parties and decided mari-
juana is less dangerous than
alcohol. Marijuana. the Marquess
says. “may induce one to be idle,
silly and sexy. but very rarely
nasty."

worth more than wives. At least

average housewife could earn her

own chart of a husband's duties.

big bang

A Princeton astrophysicist says
our universe may be just‘ one 'of
millions created during the so-called
“big bang" explosion. J. Richard
Gott suggest that an infinite
number of universes may have been
formed like “bubbles” during the
creation explosion 20 billion years
ago. Those universes. Gott cx-
plains. formed randomly . . . much
like bubbles in a glass of beer. He
says the existence of millions of
similar universes. instead of just
one. would explain the ultimate
origin of matter and the remarkable
uniformity within our own
universe. Incidentally. Gott adds
that there's no way to contact
anyone in any of those other

universes because the bubbles are
simply moving apart too fast.

legal cruise

 

The courts have made it ofﬁcial:
teenage cruising is as american as
apple pic — and cities can't ban the
practice. A state appeals court over-
turned the conviction of a Los
Gatos. California. teenager. who'd
been cited under a local ordinance
banning the weekend car proces-
sions. The court says the law. which
prohibited “driving with the pur-
pose of socializing with other
motorists or pedestrians." was too
vague and could make outaws out
of completely innocent drivers. But
Los Gatos Town Attorney Walter
Hays — who claims the city is
"‘helpless" in the face of thousands
of teenage cruisers —— isn't giving
up. He says the city will now ask the
California legislature for a state law
permitting local anti-cruising or-
diances.
