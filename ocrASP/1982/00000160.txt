WIMBLEDON. England (AP) lf
‘ Bjorn Borg has to qualify for
Wimbledon it will ‘shake the Bank
of England. But it will not move the
All-England Tennis Club. that very
British institution that rides every
calamity and goes its own way. .
The Bank of England owns the it-
tle tennis club at Roehamptonp
_ where every year 32 lesser players
compete in a qualifying tournament
for the last Wimbledon places.

“i should think the Bank of
England will be jolly worried if
Borg has to play there." said Air
Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burnett.
chairman of the All-England Club.

“There are no facilities for spec-
tators or security. They will just
have to do without spectators.
None will be allowed in if Borg ~
plays.“ 

Burnett goes to Monte Carlo next
week to consult the Professional
Tennis Council concerning the
Swedish star. five times Wimbledon
champion and the world's un-
disputed No.l until John McEnroe
took his crown from him last year.

Under the rules. Borg must either
play in a minimum of lOGrtrnd Prix

position. Rhodes will be the
designated hitter when he doesn't
play the field. Collins noted that
Rhodes is a steady fielder and a
great offensive thrcnl. but his speed
can be a liability. Wander has it
good glove and he gives the Danes a
lefty bat in the lineup.

Frank Rivera returns at second!
base for his third year on the varsi-
ty. The 5-7 junior's but played a
major role in the Danes' success last
year. bit! he slumped to a .250 in the
fall and he drove in only four rrrns.
"He‘didn't' have a great fall hitting
the ball. but he's been stroking the
ball since we went down south (to
Florida)," said Collins. “His bigv
gest asset is that he has a tremen-
-, dous arm. We probably have the
a best pivot man around (on the dou-
3 ble play)."

Veteran Bruce Rowlandvaill give
shortstop a try this year. The senior
has always been a solid hitter. he
batted .396 in the fall. but he has
been shuffled around the infield in
his career. I‘lle‘s looking real good
at short." Collins said. "And he
can hit the ball a country mile."

Bob Areurio had been a mainstay
at third base for Albany, but he left
the team in the fall. Bob Conklin
has stepped right in and filled that
ltolc. The sophomore batted .432 in
the fall. "He's looked real good
defensively this spring and he‘s star-
ting to hit well." noted Collins.
“He's a hustler; he likes to play
ball."

Tony Moschella. Tom Verde.
and Chris Orcllu will round out the
lineup in the outfield.'Moschella
will be in left field. He led the team
with a .488 batting average and 17
RBl's in the fall. Verde. the team
Captain. boasts an outstanding arm
and he's very quick in the field.
“We're expecting great things front
him at the plate." Collins said
about the eentcrﬁcider. Orella will
probably start in right ﬁeld, and he
also can “really stroke the ball."

‘Overall. Collins feels the Danes
have the potential to be a very good
offensive team. “i think our power
is good," the coach said.
“Rowlands and Rhodes have the
capability of taking the ball deep
for us."

The season begins for the butmen
tomorrow when they host Southern
Vermont for an afternoon
doubleheader. They play on the din- i
’mond behind lndian Quad.

tournaments in l982 or qualify for
Wimbledon like arty newcomer to
the circuit. Until now. he has not
agreed to do either.

if Borg does not play at
Wimbledon, which opens June 2],
a lot of fans will be disappointed.
but the All-England Club has taken
bigger disasters in its stride.

in 1973. almost the entire squad
of professionals walked out of
Wimbledon at short notice in a
dispute over Yugoslavia's Nikke

Pilic. who was suspended because
he refused to play for his country in
the Davis Cup.

That might have been expected to
kill Wimbledon as a spectacle. In-
stead, the crowds were among the
biggest of all time.

Burnett said he and his commit-
tee havc “a very clear View" of
what should be done about Borg.
but he didn‘t say what it was.

Most English tennis fans believe
Wimbledon is big enough to do
