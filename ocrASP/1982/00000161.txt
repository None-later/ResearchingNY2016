Welcome back lip lovers. To-
day’s question: who holds the
world heavyweight elevator title?
Answer: George Steinbrenncr . . .
The Mets pitching staff has abottt
as mtrch talent as the acts in
‘Telethon '82' . . . The Mouth has
finally learned what the Sly in Sly
Williams stands for. So Long Y'all

A . . . Los Angeles Dodger tnanager
Tommy Lasorda, has more chins

than a chinese phonebook . . .
The Mouth doesn't want to say
that Met first basbman Rusty
Slatrb is slow, but the only way
he’ll steal a base this year. is if
Ray Charles is the catcher . . . As
promised, here's the Mouth‘s All

are Leon Spinks, Andrea .ltteger,
Bobby Clarke, Tom Landry. and

Schmidt Thinks
Phillies’ Deals
Will Help Team

CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP)
Philadelphia Philiics third baseman
Mike Sclttnidt is the kind of person
who pulls no punches. He says what
he thinks even if it's not popular
with people, including his bosses.
So, when Schmidt, the National
League's Most Valuable Player the
past two seasons. says he thinks the
team has been improved by some
trades, which have been unpopular
'with many fans, it's worth listening
to his opinion.

The deals ittvolvcd young out-
fielder l.onnie Smith, catcher Keith
Mot'cland and veteran shortstop
Larry liowa.

Smith made a lot of fundamental
mistakes, btrt he cotrld hit, run like
a deer and always secrttcd to make
things happen. He finished the
season with a 23~ganrc hitting
streak. He went in the three—way
deal with Cleveland and St. Louis
that netted the l’hiliics catcher lio
|)ia/.

Morelarrd, a young catcher with
art effective hat, but'short in sortie
arctrs on defense, was dealt to the
Chicago Cubs iii an exchange that
brottght pitcher Mike Krakow to
Philadelphia.

liowa, the Philadelphia shortstop
for 12 years and the best statistically
at his position ‘in the majors over a
long period, had contract dif-
ficulties, fcudcd through the
newspapers with the front office
over the problctn, am! probably was
shipped more because of the per-
sottality conflict than just player
consideration.

The club’s other catcher, veteran
Bob Boone, was sold to California
0f the American League because the
l’ltillics felt he had lost the knack of
throwing ottt runners and his but
has been comparatively silent the
last few seasons.

Way down near the turtle hatc'he ,,-,

Two people at a Bar-B-Que we did see.

We ioined them for a dinner of steak and ribs.
‘ And met a man, Thomas Sean,who told us fibs.

- We heard of his 17 sisters and brothers,
nd how no gulf was given to Irish mothers.

And we were entertained by Rocky Balboa. '

Four girls gave up their luxurious room,

To two guys whose car was headed for doom.
