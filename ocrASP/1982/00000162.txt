Lacrosse ‘Squad' Seeks. to Improve;

Season Begins Tomorrow at Home

By DEE PRENTISS

___________.———
Tomorrow is the big day for
Albany State's I982 varsity lacrosse
team when they will open their
season at 1:00 against Skidmore at'
home. Defense will be the key word
during the next Week of challenging
matches against such teams as
Oneonta. R.P.l. and Union.

The starting line-up is impressive
and veteran Coach Mike Motta
feels that the freshman goaltender.
Alan Cornfield, will be a definite
asset to the already experienced
defensive corps. He turned in 20
saves against Hampden-ﬁidney and

It's the trim beauty on the bottom left.)
But unlike the others, the real beauty of Pilot's Precise Ball Liner is
the extraﬁne line it puts on paper. It glides smoothly across the page
because its tiny tungsten carbide ball is held securely within a needle-like
stainless steel collar. A collar that makes the Precise Ball Liner the most

“He was offered a slot at Penn

one of three captains; the other two
are Watson and DiNoto.

Motta's goals include improving
last year’s 5-7 record and his sights
are set on creating a team of the
same caliber as Cortland. Moria
remarked: “I think we can give
almost anyone we play a real game.
But to get to a level with a team like
Cortland is to get to championship
caliber. We’re young and we have

Fixing the NBA

Basketball fans were treated to thc fittest NCAA championship
game in recent history when North Carolina defeated Georgetown on
Monday night. it was as dramatic and exciting as a sportinggvent can
get, a good advertisement for the game of basketball. the college part
in particular. Why can’t the NBA capture this excitement?

Certainly. the NBA is a collection of the finest basketball players in

Kniclc Comeback
Tops Cleveland

NEW YORK. N.Y. (AP) As corn-
cbacks go, it was one of thc New
York Knicks‘ great ones, Coach
Red Holzmau said. But there‘s still
the matter of a playoff berth.
"You know, this shows we still

‘haven’t stopped trying." Michael

Ray Richardson said after the
Knicks rallied from a 26-point
deficit and nosed out the Cleveland
Cavaliers Ill-IIO Thursday night.
it was Richarson's live crucial
points in the closing minutes which

.won the game.

New York whittled the Cavs'
91-65 third-quarter lead to l07—92
with 6 i/2 minutes to play. but the
Knicks still trailed-110106 with 1:22
remaining. That's wlrcn Richardson
hit a three-point basket.

And moments later. he stole a
pass from Geoff Huston and drove
in for the winning basket with 63
seconds to go.

Cleveland had a few
tunitics to regain the lead. but its
last chance vanished when James
Silas took an inbounds pass and
was called for traveling with l4
seconds to play.
