the junior varsity last year and is
also an assistant football coach at
Albany. Collins will be faced with
the challenge of returning the Danes
to last year’s spring form after a

J‘l 'think this team has to prove
themselves," said Collins. “i think
they had a reputation last year that
has now gone by the wayside. They
have to earn themselves a reputa-
tion; we have to earn whatever we
want to be known as.

“We want to be known as com—
'petitive." Collins continued.
“We’re going to be right in there
plugging away."

Traditionally. Albany's strength
has been at bat and their weakness r
has been on the mound. This fall
the Danes batted .362 as a team and
scored 120 runs in is games. But at
the same time. Albany hurlers
allowed 95 runs. 68 ofthem earned.

This season Collins figures to
begin with four pitchers in the star-
ting rotation and pray that they can
go most of the way, because once
again there is little deptlt on the
staff. Ron Massaroni looks to be
the ace of the staff after the gradua-
tion of Mike Esposito. “He‘s been
looking better each time he goes out
to throw," noted Collins. “He‘s a
competitor out on the mound."

Ralph Volk posted a 2.41 earned
run average in the fall, but catne
away with only a l-3 record. Collins
described senior Mike Gartman as a
good spot pitcher who gets good
movement on the ball. Tom Mc-
Carthy will move up from the
junior varsity as the fourth starter.
“He's going to give us an added
dimension." said Collins. "He's
sneaky fast."

.lim Vaughan, a starter last yearI
is coming off leg surgery and he
tnay join the starting rotation later
in the season. “He's looking
good," said Collins. “He really
throws heat."

As far as the bullpen is concern-

ed, Collins admitted that “we could
probably use a little bit more help.”

“if they (the starters) can get us a
good five or six innings, we‘re going
to be ill pretty good shape,” he ad-
oed.

The reason Collins is so confident
is because, as usual, the Danes will
boast a hard-hitting lineup. “I
don‘t think there's a weak link in
our lineup,” Collins said. “We‘ll
feel as thorrgh we’re strong all the
way through."

indeed. the Danes seem to be
able to field a veteran at almost
every position. .ltrnior Jerry Rosen
will be handling the catching
chores. Rosen batted .444 in the
fall and looks to be one of the teartt
leaders. “He does a great job with
the pitchers," said Collins. "l-le
handles them real well."

Rhenish: Women’s Softball “Going to the Top”

By PHIL PlVNlCK

“This is the year we're going to
the top” is the way Coach Lee
Rhenish describes her Albany State
women's softball team's chances in
l982. Why shouldn‘t she be op-
timistic? Seven seniors return from
last years ll-5 squad, a team good
enough for third place iii the l981
NYSAlAW tournament.

ROTC Amendmen tDefeated in Senate

By BETH BRINSER

By a vote of4'6 to 23. the Univer-
sity Senate defeated yesterday an
amendment which would have
found the ROTC program at
SUNYA “to be violrttive of the
University's non-discriminatory
policy in that the program
discriminates on the basis of sexual
or affectional preference."

Approval of the amendment
would have rccomcndcd the cvcn-
ttttll discontinuation of the R.l’.|.
ROTC program at SUNYA.

“I’m disappointed lit the Univer-
sity Senate," said a trrcrrrber of the
Steering Cornrtrittec of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance. “l tlrougltt they
were more liberally minded."

instead, the Senate adopted a
policy which endorses the ROTC
program at SUNYA and found it
consistent with the University's
non-discriminatory policy.

Senate Liason Mark chrin said
in favor of the defeated amend-
ment, “We're only kidding
ourselves to think that the students
are getting full access witcn mnclr of
the program includes on-the-job-
training.

"Everyone in that (Assembly
hull) room, he continued. "agrees
some discrimination is going on.
We‘re setting a dangerous prccc-
dcttt by allowing a group affiliated
with such a blatantly discriminatroy
organization to corrtinrrc on cam-
pits."

A bill which would require equal

SUNY system has been proposed by
the Student Association of the State
University (SASU) and is pertding
presentation in the New York State
Assembly, accordirtg to SASU
Legislative lrrtern Alan Weiner.

Presently, SUNY Central allows
students a minimum of one-third
but no tnore titan one-half represen-
tation on individual UAS lioards.

'l'clctlton ’82 was for the kids of
Project l'iqttinox and CliARliEﬁli.
Tltc theme of Telethon '82 was a

it was.

Telethon Co-Chair Beth Sexcr

problem. there‘s not a wltolc lot i
can do about it."

He pointed otrt that he was simp-
ly a guest teacher at SUNYA.
Osborne felt the “administration
was professional. it took the treat
"or me."

Student Affairs Council Chair
Ncil (ielfand opposed the amend-
rrtcrrt. “l feel that under the present
policy anybody on campus may

it’s not in violation of present
policy."
SUNYA President ‘linccnt

O'l.eary said tltc clear intent of his

anti-discrimination policy was to
govern matters of gay rights on
campus. He said his policy went
further to protect gay rights than
any polciy of its type in the SUNY
system. I

O'Lcary explained to the Senate
that the Affirmative Action laws do
not protect the rights of homosex-
uals. Until the New York State
Legislature (incluch homosexuals
under the laws) it is inappropriate
for this campus to adopt this (the
defeated) policy.

A rttcrrrber of the Cray and Les-
bian Alliance felt "O‘I.cary cloud-
ed the issue. Those guidcnnes are
minimal thuircments." the person
said. “it's not impossible for an in-
dividual institution to go above and

beyond those requirements.

As the issue stands, according to

\chrin. “ If anyone complains
(about discrimination) the Ad-
ministration can say that the

University Scuttle said . . . (ROTC)
does not discriminate againsf-
homosexuals."

Equal Student Voice in UAS

“Every UAS corporation is fund-
cd by students for students. We
want an even fifty percent to avert a
faculty-administration autonomy,"
said Weiner.

Weiner said SUNYA student
represenation was responsible for
recently averting a price hike in
UAS board rules for next year.
“Our fifty percent trad a lot to do
with that. UAS acted responsibly
and reinvested the profits," ltc said.

SUNYA UAS General Manager
Norbctt Zahm fccls tltc proposal
should not become law.

"Each campus i, rviccd by art
individual UAS corporation,“
Zahm ‘said. “I'm a firm believer in
each corporation setting its own

Zahnr pointed otrt that to pass
such a law would violate the UAS
contract with SUNY Central, which
now allows the one-third minimum.
one-half maximum student
representation.

“lt unilaterally violates the con-
tract. When the contract expires,
then it should be Considered." He
added “it certainly is a valid pro-
posal. however."

Zalrm is afraid that such a man-
date from SUNY Central could lead
to centralized control of individual
UAS corporations.

Wciuer disagreed with labor.
“Zahm wants to maintain the status

The bill will be presented in the
legislature by Assemblyman Mark
Sicgcl when the session reconvenes
in mid-April.

Sicgcl's spokesman and Program
Analyst for Higher Education
Steven Allcnger said the legislature
will be open to passing the bill and
speculates formidable support to be
gained by SASU's lobbying efforts.

Allcnger pointed to a l977 law
which prohibited a student majority
on any State University board as the
root of the student dissatifaction.

“We're not looking to win a ma-
jority." said Weiner. "We just
want equal representation with the

Undoubtedly, ’l‘clethon'82 would
not have existed at all if it hadn‘t
been for the people behind the

“Telethon and sound are a part of

Unqucstionably. Telethon is one
of the best feelings in the lives of all
