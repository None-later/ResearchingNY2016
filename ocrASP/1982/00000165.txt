At the suggestion of First Lady
Nancy Reagan, the Smithsonian In-

Fashion. The Smithsonian, one of
13 museums to receive designer
garments worn by the first lady in
1981. says the “First Ladies
Fellowship" will allow students to
research the history of american
fashion and “the function of
costumes in personal and every day
life.”

Police in Longview, Texas,
report local teenagers are indulging
in a dangerous new fadz: getting
high by putting bags over their
heads and sniffing natural gas
through holes in pipelines. Oil com-

the lack of oxygcn'in the brain.

may have come to this planet on
board an interstellar “Noah's

Reagan Administration may reduce
