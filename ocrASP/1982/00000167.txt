“( 2 hinese cowboy songs."

This is the response one gets
_ when asking Michael Snrorlrerirran
to‘clescrlbe his music..

' Rob Edelstein

In actuality. Smotherman. ai—r Oklahoma
native who now makes his horire and his liv-
ing in California. mixes a variety of country.
rock. jazz. and Spanish Influences to create a
rather unique sound. This sound can be
described as a fusion of rock and ihrriirlra,
with a sprinkle of jazz.

“Everyone hears a different heat
the one i hear." he relayed in a telenhorre
conversation. But it goes beyond that. The
heat is'as "different" as it is interesting
Sniotherman's self-titled debut album (‘ttll-
tains a package of material that is beautifril
arid sincere when it is meant to be. and
powerful all other times.

One notices two interacting characteristics
that help make this performer stand out.
First. he has a serious attitude about his
songs and his music in general. Second. he
is not afraid to let the varied elements of iris
personality come through.

One senses. from Smotherman's music a
type of pr ilish brought out as much by effort
as pt‘l)tltlrl1l)ll. The man. for sortie reason.
seems to try harder than most. The record is -
hardly rit‘erproduced. It's just sortie rocker
having rl good time. A good example of this
is "Crazy in Love." the first song on the
album. The lyrics speak of love and the beat
is rhunrba. The vocals and music comple-
tirent each other with matching intensity.
And as for the story behind the song's coni-
posrtion. Sniothermaii describes it in the
album’s liner notes like this:

" Crazy in Love was co~written with a buddy
of mine who was as drunk as me around his
pool in LA. [Man. it sure sounded great

 

l'lirrl's

smotherman’s Roc

r".

    

Okie Dokey: Eclectic Michael Smotherman.

around the pool,"

Obviously. Smotlieininn is out to have a
good time. But he's also out to get across a
sentimental message in other tunes. For irr-
stance. his description of "Do 1 liver Cross
Your Mind." one of his softer tunes. has
mttcli more feeling:

"(The Song) was written iii a loft apart-
mentl was renting above .in old colonial
house in Nashville. during a gentle spring
shower. I feel in my heart that we all have
telepathlcally sting this song to someone
somettrne."

One gets the iriipressroir that for Smother-
iirari. making an album was nothing but fun

f I‘ here are a couple of matters that
must be cleared up first. These

as "new wave". new wave is Soft ('ell. the

thing They're certainly not punk, because
most original punk is long gone. (\lltl now

magazines like the NY. Rocker and a few

NJ.) and radio stations. Most of the thanks.
though. go to the fans that create enouin of
a stir to get some record labels to notice this
new grass roots movement. Each of these
bands was around for at least three years
(the Fleshtones and Human Switchboard for
six) before their fans undying support con-
vinced the skeptical companies to “take a
chance" and release their first LP's (hey. just
look at how poorly the Go-Go's have done.
eh?)

Human Switchboard's Who's Landing in
My Hanger is the finest of the three. and
maybe of the year so far; an emotional.
angry. and awfully Original record that's full
of bite and love. The "whole 15 greater then
the sum of the parts" complexity is what
make them so intriguing: Bob Pfeiler‘s sharp

staccato guitar and vocals. Myrna
Marcerian's farflsa organ (the center of the
songs' melodies) and soul angel cunt liltlll'
die vocals. and Ron MetA's Vigorous drumm-
irrg come together like pieces in a jigsaw puz-
zle. The fit is unique enough so that each
listen generates the discovery of more
musical and lyrical nooks and crannies

The Switchboard has been often com-

pared to the Velvet Underground and the
parallel is more symbolic than audible Sure.
liob and Myrna retiiiird rrie at times of Lou
arid Nico. but more than tlial. the inven-
tivetress of the two groups is wlial attracts the
analogies. "Refrigerator Door" is the center-
piece ol the Hanger Ll’. .i slow. acoustic
seven minute piece that builds and swirls
around cutting vocal interplay and unusual
use of Slovenian (a language). plus lyrics
and phrasing that take you by surprise They
are the only ones doing this type of song
nowadays. and it is this stark tiiodeinistn that
links the Velvets and the Switchboard.

The submission to possible coinnierciality
was rrrade by the placing of the songs starring
Marcarian's vocals on each side. So far only
college radio. though. has paid any attention
to Hanger; as a matter of fact. one I) .J. on
Q1ll4. Albany's so-called "progressive"
commercial radio station. told me that they
wouldn't play the LP because. arid I quote,
"it just isn't good enough." Not good
enough? Hal “Say No to Saturday's Girl" is
pure pop for now people. Marcarian soun-
ding so sweet and Ernie Krivda's sax solo
blending flawlessly. The title song is plain
vicious. chock full of sexual itiuueirdoes.
hard cutting lead guitar. and my favorite
emotionally gut wrenching vocals of the
year. Pfeifer's screaming and snarling ab-
solutely glorious and transcendent. Relation-
ships and betrayal are central to the lyrics.
and to stop and start vocals and instrument
action help build the sense of realism Not
good enough? Please.

The Blasters and the Fleshtoires are similar
in a few ways: first. they're both on two of
the fastest rising labels in the U.S./\.: se-

However. problems with one record corn-
pany in Nashville. and later conflicts within
his studio hand during the‘ production tell a
different story. ' ' l.
Smotherrnan commented lllill his songs
didn't fit iirto what he called the Nashville for
mula for sound. As for the.couf|ict iii the
studio. he stated that "this was iiry album If
they (the studio musicians) wanted to make
suggestiotrs. it was fine with me, liut I
wanted them to know that l was ltr control."

By reading over the lyrics provided with
the album. it becomes clear as to why
Snrotliernian would he so possessive of his
project Many of his tunes are written about.
or inspired by. personal experience. "Green

k ‘n’ Rhomba .

Eyes" is a quick moving tune about a
beautiful woman he met lll 'l'entressee Not
that this technique is anything new. Writers
often write from personal experience.
Smotliernian summed up his impression
here by saying. "l'rir not gonna write a new
worrt or a new note. It's all in the combina-
tion."

it's this coiribinatioir of lvrical influences
("Hank Williriiiis. Randy Newman. Michael
McDonald and Mirliricl Ritchie") and
musical, influences ("i love lilvrs
Presley. iroiv | listen to jam Melodic ran.
like the Crusaders. Stanley 'l'urrerrtuie.
Stanley Clarke ") which helps Sniotheriiiari
achieve a refreshing versatility and musical
vitality. His words range frotn will stucturcd
turns of phrases ("All along i thought we
thought all along the same lines") to the sub-
(‘I‘lf you think I'm lrurttn' guess again/As a
matter of fact. l'm gonna call you every
day/tell you 1 never want to speak to you
again") to the direct (“you say you're going
to leavr ’Welf. that don't bother me none/I'll
give you 20 seconrls/Tlien l'iir gonna get my
gun“).

Smotherman's other
comes front his home town in Oklahoma.
where he played drums for his nrother's
band when he was in his mid-teens.

“1 grew up with nruslc." he said "I had a
nightmare once. I dreamed there was no
more music. All of it had stopped. No birds
or stuff like that It was like death."

Sniotherman's ambition seems to‘ be
creating more music and decrease the
chances of his nightmare coming true. With
success and good reviews starting to build in
Califonria. Snrotlierman may just become
the overnight success he calls himself. Or
maybe he was talking about both his
Songwriting and his career when he said.
"it's such a beautiful thing to make
something ottt of nothing."

cond. both albums are selling better than
-most people originally thought (the Blasters
have just been re‘released on Slash/Warner
Brothers and are rising on the charts): and
last. they both are clearly "roots" bands. the
Fleshtones sound emanating from 1960's
proto-punk. arid the Blasters bring a brew of
rockabillty. blues. rhythm and blues. and

straight American rock 84 roll.

Both are great bands. but the albums fall a

wee bit short. result of it slightly srtbprii side
two on the Blasters LP. and slight over-
production on the Fleshtones Roman Gods
record. On both albums. though. the groups
riraiitc spirit shines through. The Blasters
“I'm Shakin" is a sensational cover
"American Music” Is a patriotic blast. and
“Border Radio" reminds me of the Sir
Douglas Quintet (a high cornplln’ient). Hav-
ing seen the Blasters live. l know that the
record isn't as hot as the band is. and the

 

record itself is a real ravevup. Lookout, Solid
Gold.

On the 'Torres LP. the only tlrtrig holding
it back is Richard Mazda's production. Ac-
tually. l thought it was an excellent job until I
heard their cassette ol unreleased material
called "Blast Off." when I realized that Marty
Thau. who first slgned the band some five
years ago. had the fileshtones sound down
to Spectorislr perfection. Nonetheless.
