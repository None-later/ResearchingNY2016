(AP) Welcome back, ’basebail.'
You’ve been away too long.

After an autumn of first downs
and touchdowns, as winter of giving
fouls and fouling out, of icing the
puck and just plain ice on the front
walk, April is here and it's ﬁnally
back to basics‘. 4

Pete Rose is still making head-
ﬁrst slides. Gaylord Perry is still do-
ing funny things with the baseball.
Pops Stargell and Carl Yastrzemski
are still swinging for the seats. And
Roy Campanella once called this a
little boys' game.

From now on you’ll read about
Mike Schmidt and George Brett in-
stead of Marvin Miller and Ray
Grebey. And won't that be a relief?
The news will be of runs. hits and,

errors, not‘litigations, arbitrations
and negotiations.
After last summer's hot air and

'last winter's wind chill, we've earn-

ed at least that much.

This is the best time of the year
since no matter who you root for,
your team is sitting pretty right
now. That new second baseman hit
a ton in spring training, and the
trade your club made will ﬁll in the
last piece of the puzzle. The rookie
at third makes all the plays, and the
guy in left ought to hit 30 homers.
Start the season. Our guys can't
lose. .

Hope springs eternal — now.
Seattle and Toronto haven't lost a
game yet and Oakland and the

Yankees haven't won any. The.

 

races are wide open —- now.
Anything can happen.

Baseball thrives on its own
history. The Boston Red Sox Went
from ninth place in 1966 to the
American League pennant in I967.
The New York Mets were ninth in
1968 and World Champions the
next year. It has happened before.
It can happen again. Believe it.

Being a baseball fan is walking
away from the dinner table without

eating because of the knot in your.

stomach after your team lost a
heartbreaker. The obvious anguish
simply won't permit the digestive
process to take place.

Being a baseball fan is worrying
about some guy you’ve never met

Being a baseball fan is being
devoted, the kind of devotion that
causes you'to plunk down a couple
of bucks for a cap or a shirt with the
team‘s logo.

The beauty of baseball is in its
timelessness. It is a relaxing way to
spend a lazy, hazy summer’s day in
the sun, without the least bit of con-
cern for how long it lasts.

The game's anthem includes the

right. There is no two-minute drill
in baseball, no hurry-up offense,
and, frankly, hurrying up is not
very relaxing.

Baseball was designed to be
played by nine guys on a grass field
in the daytime, but it seldom is.

But the fans forgive little in-
diseretions because of the bottom
line. They're playing baseball,
aren't they?

The long, cold winter is over. at
last.
