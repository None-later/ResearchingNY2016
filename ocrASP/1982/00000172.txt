composure and finish second.

Mancc jumped a distance of 20.2

“Our team lacks superior long
distance runners when we‘re at full
strength.“ Munsey said. “Today
we were hurt cvnn tnorc by the loss
of Jim Erwin and Winston
Johnson. They were both out with
colds. They give us added strength
in middle distance running." This
may be true. but on Saturday the
Danc's runners came through.

N Last Chance at "Winning for Netter’s .Coac‘h‘w '3

 By LARRY KAHN

.For 19 years the Albany State
women's varsity tennis team has not
hadta losing season; for 19 years
PCBSM;Mann has been their coach.
Mann has announced that this
season will be her last and she has
but one goal: “Another winning
season, that's all I can say."'said
Mann. “And to keep the spirit
we’ve had.

"We’re not as strong a team as
we were in the full." site added.
“but the spirit has been the bestin a
long time."

The women finished with n .500
record in the fall and finished in an
eighth place tie in the State cham-
pionship tournament, competing in
a field of 15 Division I and ti teams.
But this spring the Dane netters will
be trying to defy the odds. Three

the fall squad. Several other
members of the team have been
hampered in their training by in-
juries and the flit. Still. Mann
believes the team is getting together
and will be ready for their April 14
opener at West Point.

Nancy Light. the team captain.
will be the squad's number one
singles player. Joan Phillips will
play absecond singles. "She’s a
sophomore who's really been work-
ing very hard." Mann noted. Anne
Newman. Lauren lsanes. Sandra
Borrclle. and Kathleen Comerford
are the remaining singles players,
but they are still playing challenge
matches to decide their positions.

Seniors Karen O‘Connor and
Nancy Levine are slated to be the
top doubles team when the singles
players don't repeat. Other players
who will see doubles action are
Diana Marshak. Chris Rodgers.

The Albany State women's soft-
ball tcarn opcned their season on a
high note by downing Pace 8-0 on
Friday. Nancy Hallornn keyed the
attack by victimizing Pace catchch
for five stolen bases.

“We were pleased by our perfor-
rnnncc. we didn't commit any errors
and played a very solid game." said
Albany coach Lcc Rhcnish.

Albany amassed seven hits in all,

to warm up later in the season.
"Hitting against a (pitching)
machineis much different titan hit-
ting against a real pitcher. We'll get
that straightened out as the season

goes along." said the Albany
coach.
Saturday's twin-bill against

Queens College was put off due to
the elements. Coach Rhcnish‘s crew
opens up at home this afternoon at
3 PM with a double header against
