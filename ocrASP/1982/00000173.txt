Renegade Washington journalist
I. F. Stone blantcd Reagan‘s
supply-side economics for
America’s “disasterous deficit."
warned of a nuclear holocaust and
called for “a brotherhood of man”
in a speech yesterday afternoon in
Assembly Hall.

“Our inflation imposes
sacrifice." Stone told the audience
of about 300. “‘(Reagatt's) ad-
ministration is unique in that it
places the burden on the low arid
ntiddle class while giving huge sub-
sidies to the super rich."

The now- retired Stone forsook
routine journalism in the 1950's and
single-handedly founded his own
Washing/on Newsletter. which

reached a circulation of 70.000.

  
  

 
 
 

State University of New York at Albany

Through his newspaper. Stone
became legendary for his unrelen-
ting search for truth in
Washington’s bureaucratic maze.
"No one believes in Reagan’s
supply side economics anymore. ex-
cept Nancy." quipped the bespec-
tacled Stone. He reported a grow-
ing conservative faction against
Reagan's "tyrannical budget."
Stone. known as the “Maverick
of Washington." grimuced as he
told the captivated crowd how
wealthy corporations will profit by
income tax returns wltile the poor
are stripped of their possessions.
“Huge fat oil corporations may
be enjoying a negative irtcotne tax
of l7 percent. This is an outrage."
Stone said. “Now you can unders-
tand why we face this enormous tax
deficit." He reminded the audience

..
that “today is income tax day. as
you all know."

Stone griped America's "insane"
$l.5 trillion millitary budget. and
blamed it for wasting taxpayers
money. He warned it may grow to
$2.25 trillion if Reagan has his way.

“We've put our money in
glamour weapons but the fellows in
the field complain they're too corn-
plicated and too fancy and they
break down."

Stone senses a growing disquiet
within the military over the un-
wieldy budget. “Army Times pro-
tested the size of the budget. saying
it was unnecessary unless we expect
to light in every jungle and on every
tundra in the world."

He feels that Commuttistic agres-
sion is ovcrcrnphasized: "There is

Candidates Questioning Fairness in Campaign

By LIZ REICH

Questions have been raised by
several of the Student Association
(SA) executive candidates concern-
ing the fairness of the election cam-
paign.

Presidential can-
didate Mike Corso
ltas claimed that
some of his posters
and endorsement
sheets have been removed.

“Late Wednesday night i put 30
posters at different places on the
podium." said Corso. “At 4:30
Thursday morning. they had been
ripped down. Maintenance doesn't
work at night and they (the posters)
were all in legal places. so it must be
someone with an interest in the
campaign.”

SA Election Conttnissioner Steve
Topal said. “Sometimes candidates
think other candidates are ripping
down their posters. when a lot of
times, it’s maintenance."

Student working at

Another. presidential candidate
Mark Grieb has complaints concer-
ning the campaign. “I've been
treated like an outsider. because
l'm not in SA."said Grieb.

He said he submitted a poster to
the SA contact office to be printed
but “it wasn’t done the next day.
the original poster was butchered
and the copies were horrible.
Also.” said Grieb. "the other can—
didates’ posters were perfect."

SA Vice President Lori Peppe.
who is in charge of the SA Contact
Office. said Grieb never complain-
ed to her about the problem.

“i wish he had brought it to my
attention." she said. “if the copies
weren't well done. we'll redo
them."

Grieb also feels the ASPhas been
biased in the presidential elections.

“l’ve heard the ASPwas endors-
ing Mark Weprin. another
Presidential candidate. two weeks
before they interviewed all the cart-
didates."

Computer availability will be reduced beginning next semester

 

Editor-in-Chief of the ASP.Dean
Betz responded that the ASPhad no
intention of endorsing the can-
didates until after they were inter-
viewed. ”l have no idea where he
picked up that rumor and l'm sur-
prised that he's still carrying it
around."

Grieb cited the April 6 issue of
the ASPin which Weprin appeared
on the front page as evidence.
“There are a lot of University
Senators. why advertise for him?"
lie questioned.

Bell said Weprin’s picture ap-
peared on the front page of the
April 6 issue because “Mark is the
Senate liason. He was a big backer
of the ROTC replacement amend-
rrtent and gave us sotnc very good
quotes."

Weprin also has ltad problems
with the rrrttning of the election.
"Some of his (Topal‘s) regulations
are strange. For instance. we can't
campaign anywhere on the quads
except the flagroorns."

However, in relation to Topal's
rules. the new Election Regulation
act says only that “candidates or
their representatives will not be
allowed to campaign on the dinner
lines (from the ﬂagroom into the
cafeteria) ‘or in the dining rooms
during the three nights of
balloting."

Presidential candidate Andy
Weinstock reported that Weprin
has been speaking at dorm meetings
even he believes though candidates
aren't srtpposed to campaign on the
quads.

“l spoke to Steve Topal about
it." said Weinstock. “He said that
morally he's against it. but he has
no control over it.“

Vice-presidential candidate Ann
Marie La Porta found it unusual
that candidates can't be seen at
polling areas at the time of the elec-
tions.

Weprin also went on to say that
“in the past. Central Council
members ltavc been allowed to get

tax cards for other people. Now
Steve (Topal) says that isn't fair
because some candidate will get
their friend's tax cards. That’s not
true and it has always been done
that way."

a?! ,,
Scott Wexler. Corsq‘s mpaign
manager. has been Iaccuscd of
breaking into the SA Cpm-
pugraphie room over the weekend

of April 3 by Libby Post, director

of SA Compugraphie.

“l greatly resent the accusation
which was totally unfounded in
evidence." said Wexler. -

Post would not comment on the
matter.

SA President Dave Pologe said.
“(Post) thinks someone broke into
the SA office and used the corn-
pugraphic rnaeltine. but the claim
that it was Wexlcr is totally un-
substantiated.”

Topal has said that “my main
goal for the election is to make it
equitable for all candidates."

Computer Center Hours Restored

liy LIZ Itl‘llCll

The computing center‘s nortmtl
hours were reinstated Monday after
lltey were cttt by 57 percent two
weeks ago. However. beginning itt
September tltc administration will
lirttit tltc amount of time students
cart spend on computers according
to the Dean of the (‘ollcgc of
Science and bltllilclllillics l)nnic|
Wulff.

Wulff e\plained the hours were
reinstated because the tttltttittit.lt.t~
tiotr. “didn't realize the difficulties
irt implementing the system" of
reduced horns.

Associate Director of llte corn-
ptttitrg center lien Chi said students'
computing time must he lirrtitcd ill
the futttrc because. “lEuclt year
students seem to spend twice as
much computing tirue as the
previous year."

“litlt‘ifCSl student will be given
art allocation oicornputcr time. (for
an assignment) Chi said. “Once
that rs gone. students will be given

another allocation. After that.
students will have to eotrrpute at
night."

thlff noted two problems will]
the proposed plan.

The first in devising some way
computers cart shut down when a
student‘s allocation is exhausted.

('lri suggested one solution would
he examine the current balance of
computer tirtte much more fre-
quently. to ascertain when a stu-
dent's ttllotttttcnt has been ex-

haustcd.

The second security related pro
blctrt Wtrlft ttotcd under the present
system, is that sudettts ehoosc
aliases. With the proposed syslcttt.
students would be unable to
establish aliases.

"if a student looks over another
students shoulder and sees their ac-
cortrtt number. ltc could have access
to that student's file for the rest of
the setttcslct.” said Wulff.

lien Chi is currently investigating
solutions to both problems. 'llc
tropes to have them solved by
September.
