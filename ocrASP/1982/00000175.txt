AUSTIN. Texas (CPS) One of the
schools that led an anarchic nation-
wide trend toward throwing student
government off campus has moved
toward rcinstituting its student
government.

in a recent election. students at
the University of Texas-Austin ap-
proved a constitutiotl for a new stu-

dent government.

Tcxas' life without government
wasn’t altogether unusual. Dozens
of colleges across the country have
disbanded their student assemblies
for a variety of reasons. and several
others are considering doing so
now.

A number of them have now

Single-Sex Dorms Gain Popularity

(CPS) Even single-sex dorms are
now getting stricter.

Last month. the University of
Alabama announced it was creating
a special "closed residence" hall
that will be off limits to members of
the opposite sex 24 hours a day.

Wltilc a number of campuses
have reported over tlic last year tlial
they were either not offering co—cd
dorilis as an option to their students
anymore or eoitvcrtiilg mixed-
gcndcr dorms to single-sex.
Alabama may be the first major
university to lock up a single-sex
dorill. Tile result will be a hall like
those tllat were tile rule on cam.
ptiscs until the late 19605.

“We had requests by botll
students and parents." explained
.lohn Kagle. Alabama’s assistant
housing director." aild we felt like
there was a need to offer the closed
residence option to students."

Tllc trend to “privacy, quiet. and
an atmosphere more conductive to
academic life" is in fact now the
predominant one in campus hous-
ing ilationwide.

“Choice and options are the wat‘
chwords today." said Cary North.

president of the Association of Col-I
legc and University Housing Of-
ficers aild director of housing at the
University of Illinois.

“Students today want options
and alternatives in campus
housing." North said. “and schools
are increasingly trying to provide
those options. Wc‘vc (housing of-
ficers) all bccotlle much more
lilttrkct- aiid consumer-oriented."

Colleges nationwide are now of-
fering students such housing alter-
natives as “quiet” dorms. North
says. which restrict the noise level
aild other activity that could
distract students frotn their
academic pursuits.

Michigan State University, which
is credited as being a forerunner in
the trend. currciltly has over 3000
students living in “quiet houses"
and “quiet balls" on campus.

“We‘re in the process now of
finislling up some market surveys
tllat are designed to tell us the kinds
of housing alternatives students are
interested in," said MSU housing
director Robert Underwood.
“We‘re finding that students are
very interested in privacy and less
noise.”

created replacements.

Besides Texas. Dartmouth,
Virginia, Georgia. Southern iilinois
at Edwardsville and Northern Col-
orado. among others. have
disbanded all or part of their stu-
dent governments since l978. in ad-
dition. Oklahoma. Eastern Men-
nonite College. Stanford and
Missouri have recently considered
dissolving their governments. too.

in most cases, the dissoliitions
were prompted by public govern-
ment bungling of campus events.
seeminglywcndlcss government hag-
gling and resultant stiidcilt apathy.

Texas was tllc first major univer-
sity iii the seventies to actually vote
for anarchy.

“Tile motive at the time of
abolisliment was to rC-tll’gllllllL‘tl the
government by getting rid of it and
starting over.“ recalled Richard
Hcllcr. UT’s assistant dctiti of
students.

liitt dcspitc urgings from the ad-
ministration. sttidcills regularly rc-
jcctcd efforts to replace it iiiltil the
elections tliis March. [Even then.
voter turnout was low. llcller said
the university hasn't been hurt
nlucli by tile lack of it student

government. Students serve on tile
same campus comtnlttccs that
politicians used to. titid tllc more
than 500 student organizations at

‘Austin had taken up much of the

slack for special interest groups. in
addition, each college witllin the
ilnivcrsity maintains its owtl student
council.

Blit the disappearance of a cell-
.tral government “has meant that we
haven't had a central representative

body to comment on campus
issues." Heller observed.
At Georgia. which followed

Texas into anarchy in l979. “there

Anarchy Reigns on Dozens of College CampItSes

are a few people who have express-
ed an interest in student govern-
ment. but there’s nothing for-
mulated or concrete in the works."
reported Assistant Vice President
for Academic Affairs Tom
Cochran.

Yet he expected a centralized
government to re-appcar “within
the next couple of years."

“There's still a place for a cen-
tralized student voice." he contend-
ed. "and. personally. i‘d like to see
student government back on cam-
pus. it provides tliat focal point of
student interest. and assures
everyone that students have a voice
in what's going on."

Similarly. “it all started out real.
rcal negative when the government
was first abolished" at Northern
Colorado. said Mary llctli Gibson.

UNC’s campus activities coar-
dlnlltor. ‘

“But it’s turned out to be very
aositlve. Students themselves ad-
mitted that what they had didn't
work. and now we've created
tomctlllng better. The new system is
l heck of a lot more accountable."

The new system. launched last
year. allows for one student presi-
dent and it vice presidents to help
make decisions in various areas of
student concern like student ser-
vices. university relations. equal op-
portunity and acadcnlic and faculty
affairs.

Dartmouth. which abolished its
undergraduate council in 1969. two’
years ago also rcinstituted a student
assembly. iliostly to help focus stu-

‘dcnt participation in campus af-

fairs.
