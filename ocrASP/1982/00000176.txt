(CPS) Students may soon get to
choose from a somewhabe’xotie ar-
ray of programs to help them pay
their way through college.

Among the ideas some colleges
are considering to help them hold
onto the five million students who,
in the wake of cuts in student aid
for I982. are going to have to figure
out new ways to finance their
educations are:

Individual Education Accounts
that rival Individual Retirement Ac-
counts. special insurance tuition
funds. state-backed bonds for
private colleges. ambitiorts campus
employment agencies. broad tax
deduction programs. lotteries for
student loans. and even payoffs in
return for. as one college president
recently put it, “getting into bed
with the Defense Department.”

The schemes. of cottrse. spring
front Congress’ October 198] deci-
sion to cut federal student aid pro-
grams by as much as l2 percent for
the 1982-83 fiscal year.

Administrators‘ rewards for con-
eocting successful schemes are im-
pressive.

"Schools that come up with
substantial alternatives could find
themselves facing mass migrations
of students" at registration next
fall. predicted Dallas Martin of the
National Association of Student
Financial Aid Administrators.

“We’re in a whole new ball game
now." confirmed Dr. Vance Peter-
son of Southern Cal. "and it's our
job to try and compensate for the
various losses."

USC. for example. now lets
students beat future tuition ltikes by
paying “all fortr years of a student’s
education at the current tuition
rate." Peterson said students do it
by paying in one lump sum. repay-
ing a seven-year USC loan. or-put-

ting up parents’ houses as collateral ~

for 15-year loans administered by
four local banks.

Indiana University. on the other
hand. is trying to make up the losses
by working “very closely with job
placement" to get more students
more part-time jobs. said lU aid
Director Dr. Jimmy Ross.

Malcolm X College in Chicago is
trying the same thing by furinelling

Video Yearbooks
.Seen on Campus

TORRANCE. CA (CPS) In a trend
that may soon find its way to col-
lege campuses, six California high
schools are experimenting this year
with video yearbooks to supplement
their usual paper editions.

“We're not trying to replace
paper yearbooks at all." said Dart
l-‘aii‘oin. prodricer/director of
Video Yearbooks. Inc.. the corti-
paiiy which is producing the
videotapes. “This is something
students can add to their regular
yearbooks as it supplement.“

“We do highlights of major
events. edit them. and blend them
with music." he e\p|iiitied. “There
are also interviews with students
and a section where the kids can
give their wishes lot the Ititriic.”

Cuts Spur N eW Creativity in" College Financing

students “into study-related jobs.“
but aidDirector Ramiro Borja fit-ids
a “problem in competing with more
prestigious schools for those kinds
of jobs."

California may get a constitu-
tional amendment 'to allow a state
lottery. which would give its profits
to education and defray tuition at
state schools.

Its chances of getting on the
November state ballot “are

unknown." said a spokesman for
Assemblyman Larry Kapiloff.
“Lottery proposals have been
around for years.“ Ite added. “This
is considered a drastic measure, but
the system has been cut so muelt
already that something like this is a
necessity." -
Similarly. University of Ariloua
student President Richard Garcia
tried to convince state legislators to
devote to student loans the tax
eventies the state will start collec-
titig on campus facilities.
But “legislators wouldn't really
even listen to me." Garcia reported.
More typically. colleges have

 

 

resorted to tapping previously-
'nvlolate stock portfolios and en-

dowments funds for student aid.

Williams College. for one, is
'rcinvesting $5 million in endown-
ment funds in loans to parents.

Few schools can afford to do that
for long. however. Williams is “for-
tunate to be in the position we're in.
Many other schools don't have our
options." pointed out aid Director
Philip Wick.

Consequently many of the new
schemes cross school and state
lines. A Boston insurance company
is new marketing an insurance-
tiiition plan.

The plan. according to Donald
Coleman of the Richard C. Knight
Iitsurance Co.. arranges with
parents to pay tuition money direct-
ly to a college. Parents then relin-
btirse the company in regular. un-
varying monthly paynrents -— plus
interest — throughout two. three or
four-year plans.

Parctits. in turn. cart earn interest
on any trioney in the account that
has yet to he paid to the college,
Coleman explained.

The plan's been around for a few
years. targeted at parents earning
“upper-middle income and above."
with students at private colleges.
"We aren't on too many state carri-
prises yet, but as the schools search
for alternatives. we expect them to
be more open." Coleman said.
Idaho. for one. recently began
referring aid applicants to them.

The best long-range replacement
‘i‘or lost aid programs, argued
Hunter College President Donna
Shalala to a recent New York
educators' convention. ls "getting
into bed with the Defense Depart—
ment."

Shalala said that. by allying itself
with “the military-industrial com-
plex." higher education can once
again make itself “central to what
Washington is all about," which
she defined as “foreign policy, the
State Department. defense and tax-
ation."

Closer to campus. Connecticut.
North Carolina. Florida. Oregon,
Michigan. New Hampshire. Iowa.
Maryland and Ohio are all con-
sidering replacing federal aid with
agencies to sell tax-exempt bonds to
help finance strident tuition bills. ll-
liriois and Massachusetts have
already started their programs.

In Illinois. explained Regina
Nolan of the state Department of
Public Financing. the bond agency
will sell tax-exempt bonds to the
public. Proceeds of the sitles will
aelp guarantee strident loans at
pritate colleges urortnd the state.
While bond-buyers get tax-free in-
terest frotn the bonds, students and
parents repay the loans over ten
years. ‘

Public colleges nixed the bond
program, Nolan said, because the
colleges themselves must insure the
stale against financial loss and “if a

  

would not necessarily have the
assets with which toﬁmake good."
Private colleges generally use their
stock portfolios as collateral for the
bonds.

Some public colleges — especially
those with large endowments —-
may join the bond program in some
itates. sources said. *

But bonds can be hard to sell,
observed Peter Avalone of Merrill
Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith in
New York.

“The marketability is determined
'1" the security (of the bond). and
.ight now the security provisions
are tip in the air."

Some states are nervous about is-
suing siteh bonds for fear the
federal government. mad at losing
the money that ordinarily would
have gone into Washington’s tax
coffers. will some day shut them
down.

That fear. said Treasury Depart-
ment spokesman Charles Powers. is
probably unfounded.

So is the notion that any of the
replacement schemes can compen-
sate for the loss of the federal aid
programs, inany educators argue.

“Everybody is looking for new
funds." observed William Johnson.
aid director at Kent State. “As far
as I know. there will be. no new
tnoncy to replace any of what is lost
by the budget cuts. None."

Martin terser asserted. “There is
no short-term alternative to federal
funds. ’
