hotel shelter

There may be growing concern
about the threat ofnuclear war. but
there's no reason to let it ruin your.
vacation. A Japanese hotel has been
fortified. acording to a spokesman.
to withstand the blast of a nuclear
explosion and accomodate 3.000
guests for up to two weeks after the
bomb drops. Kyoto’s Century
Hotel inelucs a fully stocked bomb
shelter. along with airtight doors
and filters to seal out radiation. The
spokesman says the fortifications
were ordered by the hotel‘s owner.
who thinks nuclear war is in-
evitable, but also believes “in pro-
viding our guests with the best
facilities."

hit the books

 

High school students will have to
start hitting the hooks again. if they
want to Inake it to college: a new
study shows academic achievement
is three times as important as per-
sonal qualities in college admis-
sions. The study also puts to rest the
myth that outstanding extracur-
ricular activitcs are weighed heavily
in the decision-making process.
although they may look good com-
bined with high grades. Jointly
sponsored by the College Board and
Educational Testing Service. the
study reports that students' class
rank and test scores are the two
main academic factors considered
in admissions.

wrongly dismissed from their
teaching jobs at a church school in
Hampton. New Hampshire. Their
attorney — .Iolm McEachcrn —
argues the dismissals were a breach
of their employment contracts with
the diocese. and thus a breach of
civil law. But the bishop's attorney
is urging a local judge to stay out of
the matter and let the pope make
the final decision.

proposed increase

Tax-cutting measures may be
driving up new. home prices. At
least it's happening in California.
where proposition l3 started the
trend toward property tax reduc-
tions. California cities — pinched
for money as a result of proposition
l3 -—- are forcing housing
developers to finance new schools
and parks. and the developers are
passing that cost along to home
buyers. As a restilt. according to a
University of California study. the
median price of a new home in the
Golden State is $36,000 above the
national average. while only a
decade ago. California home prices
were in line with the rest of the na-
tiou.

extinct species

Neanderthal man may be alive

. and living in Outer Mongolia.
The respected British Archaeology
Journal Antiquity is out with a
report about neanderthal-likc
creatures who've been sighted in
areas of southern Russia and
Mongolia. The journal says the
upright, mostly hairless liumanoids
have body and skull structures
strikingly similar to the ncander-
thals — a race thought to have been
extinct for 30 thousand years. The
author of the Antiquin article. ar-
chaeologist Myra Schackley. claims
"reputable" scientists and dozens
of herdsmcn have seen the'strangc
looking creatures. And. Shackley
adds. huge‘ footprints and crude
stone‘age style tools have been
found in areas where the

humanoids - known locally as
"Almasti" — have been spotted.

city smells

A dab of Detroit and a sniff of
Chicago are now available in hot-
tles. Jan Baxter of “Makes Scents"
creates urban colognes -— including
“essence of" Chicago. New York
City. Michigan‘s upper peninsula
and Detroit. Baxter says she tries to
sniff out the best of a city. “Every
city has awful smells." she says.
“but I try to capture the positive
smell — and thats always a nice
oneI a romantic. sensuous one."
Baxter's bottled I‘New York City"
is spicy, .her “RocltcStcr. New
York" smells like lilacs. and her
“Niagara Falls. Canadian side" is
woodsy. The colognes sell for about
five dollars per half-ounce.

madless future

MAD magazine has fallen on hard
times. After 30 years of publishing
irreverent parodies of adver-
tiscmcrus. movies and politicians.
MAD's circulation has fallen to
about a million. less than half the
number sold during the magazine's
heyday a decade ago. “i don‘t
know if MAD has much of a
fitting" says publisher William
Gaines. “Kids just aren't as
rebellious as they use to be." Media
expert John Reidy agrees: "It‘s just
harder to make fun of things.‘ he
says. “Nowadays kids already
know everyone lies."

$20,000 above their market value
. . . all because they were worn just
once by Princess Diana. West Ger-
man jeweler Genio Haklmi admits
his asking price of “30,000 is
higher than normal. But he says he
has documentary proof the
diamond-studded jewels once
adorned what has since become the
royal neck. At last report. the
jewels were still in Hakimi‘s shop in
Dusseldorf. awaiting a buyer.

no integrity

An ltalian doctor is facing a
prison term. charged with perform-
ing vasectomies on 200 men at their
request. Dr. Giorgio Conciani is
believed to be the first physician
anywhere in the world to be
criminally charged for conducting
voluntary male sterilization opera-
tions. The surgical procedures are
banned under a 50-year-old Italian
law that specifically forbids “crimes
against the integrity and health of
the race.” Couciani. who previous-
ly was brought to trial after perfor-
ming voluntary abortions on female
patients faces a six-to-twclvc-ycyr
prison sentence if convicted.

professor fails

A computer that analytes student
essays says Colorado State Univer—
sity President Ralph Christol‘ferson
would have trouble passing a
freshman English course. English
instructors used the computer to
evaluate Christofferson's inaugural
address. delivered last fall. The
computer's verdict: The president's
sentences are too long — one ran 57

words — and he uses too many
phrases like "institutional intertla”
and intellectual myopia."

atockman the dog

 

This probably isn‘t the sort of
tribute David Stockman had in
mind. but the owner of The Allan-
tie magazine has named his
labrador puppy after the Reagan
bitdgct director. Mort Zuckerman
says his dog — “Stockman” — was
named in appreciation of last year‘s
controversial interview with the
budget director. which boosted The
Allunu'e‘s advertising and circula-
tion rates. "Stockman." Zucker-
man says. apparently referring to
his dog. "represents a tricke-down
theory that really works."

acid rain

Acid rain is taking its toll on the
eastern United States. A study
prepared for the Office of
Technology Assessment concludes
that about one-fifth of all eastern
lakes and streams have been damag-
cd by acid rain. The study says if
the sulfuric and nitric acid deposits
continue. about 80 percent of the
waterways in the northeast and up-
per midwest will be in danger. The
Environmental Protection Agency
reports that it has increased the
budget for acid rain research to a
total of about 22 million dollars for
‘1983.
