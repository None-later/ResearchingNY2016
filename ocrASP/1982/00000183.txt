Alliance (NYPIRG/CA). is a type or oil
buying cooperative for those who use home
heating oil. By pooling the needs of hun-
dreds. even thousands of healing oil users.
the consumer can receive retail service at
wholesale prices.

Membership in the group is $l5 annually,
and members will receive lhc options of
automatic. demand and emergency service,
a budget plan, 30 day credit and a service
contract. In addition, the Fuel Buyers
Group provides an ombudsman service. to
insure that all service guidelines are follow-
ed.

The Group. already effective in New
York City and Long island, has saved as
much as 28¢ per gallon for its members.
This has added up to savings of over $300
for some members during last winter alone.

The supplier for the group will be the
local company that submits the most accep-
table bld. We will only accept the contract
lllﬂi provides all the options mentioned
above. and can guarantee that the price of
oil will be lower than if purchased outside
the group.

For more information on joining the Fuel
Buyers Group, contact me at: Citizens
Alliance, l84 Washington Ave.. Albany.
NY. 12210, or telephone 436-0870.

Election Control

SA has a well earned reputation for running poor elections. The election
three years ago led to a cover—up of a ballot-box stuffing incident. Last year’s
election was marred by confusion over tax cards and by a general lack of ill-
terest. This year. the election campaign is being tightly controlled by an all-
powerfui election commissioner. By over-regulating the campaign. SA is setting
itself up for another rotten election.

The thick packet of election regulations is being arbitrarily enforced by an
election commissioner who seems to answer to no one. The regulations are being
poorly interpreted, and the students may end up as the real losers in this elec-
tion.

Candidates have already found plenty to complain about. Some campaign
posters have been pulled down down from “legal” places. while others are seen
in "illegal" places for days. Prohibitions against professional campaign
materials have been incquitably enforced.

 
       

Even the ASP has been hasslcd by bizarre interpretations of election regula-
lions. We were warned several days ago by the election commissioner that we
couldn't distribute our paper in the Campus Center lobby next Tuesday. if we
did. he threatened to llll'OW away the paper. He thought our endorsement to be
“campaign materials." The commissioner reconsidered, and later graciously
granted us permission lo distribute our newspaper as we wished. Even if lhc
election regulations regulated the ASP (which they can’t, ofcoursc) the election
commissioner was out of line. This incident is an cxccilcnllexamplc of the faults
with SA‘s election commission. The commissioner has such broad powers of in-
tcrpretution he can rule a newspaper editorial “cleclioncering.” and iry lo con-
trol it.

The goal the SA‘S election campaign regulation was admirable. The purpose
was to pul all the candidates on an equal footing. and make lhc campaign as fair
as possible. Uni‘ortunaliy, the election regulators are making the campaign un-
fair and incquul by poor interpretation of confusing regulations.

SA should put more lliougiil iiilo its election process. Commissioners should
be well isolated from the political battles inside SA. Thcy shouldn‘t become part
of lhcm.
