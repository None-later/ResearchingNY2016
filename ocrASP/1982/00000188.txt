‘ Conference Calls

The recently concluded NCAA basketball season did nothing to
stop the debate as to which conference plays the best collegiate basket-
ball. l98l-82 was the most competitive season in a long time, as no
league won more than 70 percent of their games against other divsion 1
conference teams. What we have done here is to look over the past
three seasons. and ﬁgure out each conference‘s record against the
other eighteen major conferences, Then we cut down the list of nine-
teen to a final eight, which you see here.

8. MISSOURI VALLEY — The MVC has had the last two NIT
champs, as well as a penalized power in Wichita State. They have won
55 percent of their non-league games, but only 43 percent against the
top seven converences. The league which gave us Larry Bird will get a
whole lot more respect if Willis Reed can land 7-foot Benoit Benjamin,
a Louisiana high school sensation for his Creighton Blue Jays. The
biggest strike against this league is its geography. as the MVC has
teams in places like Canyon. Texas; Carbonate. lllinois; and Las
Cruces. New Mexico.

7. BIG 8 — The nation's best football conference isn't quite as for-
tunate in the winter. The tap three, Missouri, Kansas, and Kansas
State. are perennial contenders for the national title, but the other five
have been invisible. That may be changing, however. as new coaches
such as Tom Apke at Colorado and Billy Tubbs at Oklahoma have
their programs on the right track. Big 8 teams have won ll of 13
against PAC l0 opposition over the past 3 seasons. but have lost 9
of to tOVSEC teams. Overall, the Big 8 has a 43-47 record against the
'other sevond Top eight converences. the fourth best record in this
.group.

6. BIG EAST — The nation's newest powerhouse made a big splash
last month by landing three of the eight in the NCAA’s. This is the big
money conference, with a team in every major northeastern TV
Imarket. Despite all of this, the Big East has won only 37 percent of

the ACC. S of 6 to the SEC, 5 of,7 to the Metro, and 4 of 5 to the
MVC. Georgetown and Villanova are certainly national powers for
years to come. but after them, especially with Dr. Tom Davis leaving
Boston College, you have to wonder if there is that much power left.
5. PAC to — One of two in this group that does not play post-season
conference tournament. This league, with the exception of UCLA,
does not fare well in the post-season arena. Oregon St. got blasted
once they played a non-western team in the NCAA's while USC and
Washington made quick departures from their tournaments. One of
only three conferences that have been above .500 for all three seasons
'in non-conference play, however. Maybe that is because they play so
many Big Sky teams instead of venturing into WAC more often.

‘4. METRO — For the first time, this season this league has more titan
iLouisville to brag about. The Memphis Tigers, led by Keith Lee.
dethroned Louisville for the first time this season, and almost snuck
into the finals of the East regional before losing an OT game to
.Villanova. This league has little depth. as indicated by its nonwinning
lrecord against every Top Eight conference except the Big East.

3- SEC — With Kentucky, LSU, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississip-
pi. the SEC boasts the most outstanding teams of any conference.
They also possess some lame ducks in Mississippi St. and Florida.
which drag down the league's record. Despite this, the SEC boasts
winning records against all the top eight leagues except for the ACC.
Their 12-9 mark-against Big 10 teams puts them on a level very close to
the top two conferences, but their lack of one truly outstanding club
that wins national title prevents them from gaining the top spot.

2. BIG )0 -— ln l979380 and l980-8l. the Big to was the nation’s Md
conference, and there really wasn't much question about it. This year.
lion/ever, the Big 10 struggled from the start. finally finishing 30-38 in
nOn-lcague play. They even lost their season series with the Mid-
Amcrican Conference, ranked 16th out of 19 leagues. Teams like
Micltigan. Wisconsin, Northwestern and Michigan St. made the Big 10
a very tnediocre league. Even league leaders Minnesota and town were
early victims of post-season play. losing to TcmtcsseoChattnnoogn
and Idaho. respectively. in the NCAA’S.

1» ACC — After being ranked second the previous two seasons, the
ACC took over the top spot this season. With the top two learns in the
nation during the regular season in North Carolina and Virginia. the
'ACC won over two-thirds of their non-league games, despite the
Presence of Georgia Tech, a league member for football reasons
only.For only the third time. an ACC team won the NCAA title. when
North Carolina won their second title, matching Clemson's NCAA
,football title. which was captured New Year's Night.

The ACC is a very consistent conference, which is why it must be _
considered the nation’s best. The top conference of each particular
Season varies from year to year but the ACC is always right there near

assisted by Warren Wray. The rest '

of the first quarter belonged to Cor-
tland, controlling the ball
throughout the period and adding
three more goals for a 4-l advan-
tage.

The Dragons fast
Albany in the second quarter for
three quick goals; all point blank
shots against freshman goaltender
Alan Cornfield. However, Albany.
rallied with goals from Dave Faust,
Don Casadonitc and finally the se-
cond from Reilly with 13 seconds
left in the half to close the score to
8-4 at half.

The Danes came out fired up to
start the second half and played
Cortland to a standoff for most of
the quarter. When Tom Pratt
scored on an extra man situation,
Albany seemed to gain momentum.
That momentum was quickly
squelclted by penalties to the Danes,
with the Dragons taking advantage
of those man up opportunities.

“The officialsavould not allow us
to gain any momentum," replied
Asst. Coach Gary Nccsc. “We
spent most of the fourth quarter a
man or two men down. it's awful
tough to control the ball in those
situations."

The Dragons scored five fourth
quarter goals for a 14-6 final.

“A number of people who are
familiar with lacrosse remarked on
what a fine game our guys played.
They played tough. Cortland is
definitely the toughest team we'll
face this year, and if we play the
rest of our schedule the way we did
Tuesday, we'll have one hell of a
year,“ remarked Ncese.

(AP) Some bests and worsts from
Ithe 1981-82 National Basketball
Association season: g
' >Besl player — Moses Malone.
What he lacks in all<around skills
and ﬁnesse, he makes up for in in-
‘ tensity. Larry Bird, who doesn't
' even start anymore, has more all-
9 around talents, but the feeling here
: is that Houston would be a worse
1 team and Boston might be better if
i Malone and Bird switched teams.

. >823! rookie —— There have been
libettcr players to come into the
‘ league in previous years. but you
i would be hard-pressed to find a
deeper crop of first~ycar players
"than this season's. An inordinate
number of teams even had two
rookies who played key roles. lsiah
~Thomas and Kelly Tripucka at
Detroit, Buck Williams and Albert
King at New Jersey, Jay Vincent
and Mark Aguirre at Dallas and
lJe‘fl’Ruland and Frank Johnson at
Washington all helped their teams
. go from terrible to at least rcspco
table. Buck Williams didn’t score as
well as some of the others, but he
gets the nod for being the No.3 rc-
.bounder in the entire league. a
remarkable achievement for a

rookie.

>595! team —- Boston Celtics. The
I record and their til-game winning
t streak speak for themselves. Make
i them the favorites to become the
first team to successfully defend all
NBA title since another group of
Celtics in 1968-69. The Lakers,
t Bucks or 76ers are within to games
of the Celtics and could challenge

San Diego was smart enough to
hang onto its first-round draft
choice.

>Besl team that Was supposed Io
be among the worst — Washington.
Nearly everyone believed the Bullets
would have a miserable season after
'osing kingpins Elvin Hayes, Wes
Unseld, Mitch Kupchak and Bobby
Dandridge. Detroit, which owns the
Bullets’ first-round draft pick, was
licking its chops in anticipation of
getting another superb rookie for
next season. instead, the Pistons
will probably, miss the playoffs
while Washington is in. Coach
Gene Shue is the magician who
molded “problem players" Spencer
Haywood and John Lucas, veterans
Greg Ballard andKevm Grevey and
youngsters like Ruland and
Johnson into a cohesive unit that
plays defense with the best.

> Worst learn that was-supposed to
be the has! — it’s hard to choose
between New York and Chicago in
this category. Both teams made the
playoffs in l981 and were believed
to be on the way up. The Knicks
almost reversed their 50-32 record
of the previous season and the Bulls
were even worse.
