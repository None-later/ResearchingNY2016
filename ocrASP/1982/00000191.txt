fitming trends previously reported.

Of the 23 tttillion Atttericatts talk-
ing a language other than English in
their homes. 48 percent are speak-
ing Spanish, the report said.

Asians, according to the 1980
ccnstts. had a median fantin income
in tltc United States of $22,075 a
year. The median family income for
whites was $20,840. Hispanic
families had a median income of
$14,711 and blacks had a median
income of $12,618.

The median household income ~

for the cottntry as-a whole in 1979
was $16,830, up 98.3 percent from
1969.

The percentage ofpcople living in
poverty declined from 13.7 percent
to 12.5 percent during the decade
ending 1980. with the largest decline
itt the South.

“A high percentage of people itt
poverty are women raising
children," said Census Director
llruee Chapman. “Poverty scents to

tennis

attach itself to people trying to raise
cltildrctt alone."

Chapman doctmtcnted tlte widely
reported growth in tltc number of
women in the work force, commen-
ting that tile way for a fantin to
succeed economically is for the
woman to work.

Between 1970 anti 1980. the
number of working women jumped
58 percent. while tnctt in the work
force increased by 42 percent. he
said.

"This is a milestone report."
Chapman said. "What ,it is. is a
snapshot of lite country."

Other major findings included:

> Americans ttsirtg public
transportation to get to work
declined to 6.3 percent in 1980,
down from 8.9 percent a decade
earlier.

> For the first time tnore tltatt
ltrtll' — 66.3 pcrccttt — of all per-
sons aged 25 anti over have cont-
plclcd four years of high school.
