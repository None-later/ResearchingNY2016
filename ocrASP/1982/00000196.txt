to tlte problem. If thc‘stttdetrts of tire sixties
spent their titne attacking apathy. the war
ttray never have been ended. Doesn‘t (irieb
realize that tlte ottly way to end apathy is by
avoiding arty attack on apathy itsell‘ and iii-
stead attacking isstrcs with action backed
with ideas?

Well (irieb seems to be making himself
l’eel good. stroking his ego. running all over
campus telling everyotre that he will throw
apatlry otrt of the university. There was a
guy named Varro in Rome a few centuries
ago who went arouan campaigning on the
platform that he would throw llanttibal (tilt
of Route. He never told anyone how. thus

7 he was elected. and thus fell Rome.

Furthermore. (irieb is full ol'ct‘y—baby at-
tacks against tlte other candidates. the Stu-
dent Association, arid ASP for treating him
unfairly. III the ASP (on April 16) he said
“I heard the ASP was endorsing Mark
Weprin two weeks before they interviewed
all the candidates." First of all, who did he
hear it from. and second why doesn't he
réalizc that the ASP can endorse whoever
they want whenever they want without any
discussion whatsoever with airy ot' the cart-
didales?

Just like (irieb is a Ellilltlt‘ltJIV it
Shakespeare‘s Ollie/lo named Iago. Mc-
(‘ttuley described lago‘s manner as “the
motive hunting of a Irrotireless ntaligtrity."
Could better words be found to describe
one whose sole purpose is to “raise hell"?

——-Riehnrd Lerner

Vote Nay For SA

To the lidltor:

As students of SUNYA. we would like to
evpt'ess ottt disrtpprotttl ol' the proposed
referendum l which will appear on the Stu-
dent Associtttiotr‘s Spring 1%‘2 l lectiotr
llallot.

While the student llt‘lit‘il) lee does pro-
vide worthwhile funding for many ol the
campus orearri/ation‘s rtetirities, we
blatantly rtblror the use of such funds for rr
partisan political otgarti/ation srrclr as
NYI’IRU. While NYI’IRL‘r‘s goals may be
cotrmrerrdrible. we do not beliete that the
stttdetrt bod) slrotrld be required to l‘irratt-
cially assist a group whose goals and ac-
tivities may lie contrary to certain strrdcttt‘s

 

 

beliefs.

Since the student rrctitit)‘ tee is not op-
tional. adherence to the proposed rel‘erett-
drrtrr would put students in an uncout-
promising position.

Additionally, we_oppose the rise ol a
referendum as the itrsrr trrrrerrt to secure l‘rrtt-
ding for one group at the esperrse of other s.
Will rrevt year ‘s t'eleteudturr ask sttrderrts to
fund the ('orrrttrrrrrist l’artr‘.’

We urge all students to restrrrtrditreh
defeat this measure on the tiltilllltls rhrrt rt
llll(lllCl_\ ltttors rt partisan political group at
our L'\pt.‘ltse.

term derogatorily; 3) encouraged raeisrtr in
the university by using racist remarks; 4)
and leaves one wondering if the ASP will
continue to publish strelr articles that offend
Black students.

When the ASP publishes racist articles it
does not only affect Black students htrt all
minorities in general. The Minorin Task
Force is greatly concerned and questions
your validin itt ptrblislring such articles.
Also. we would like to add that when mock-
ing famous and talented Black women
vocalists it is not humorous brtt shows your
ignorance with distinguishing true artists

Corso Of Course

 

To the Edltor:

When-l stepped down front the vice-
presidency of Student Association I told
myself tltat while I would help out where I
could on the business and. I would refrain
front getting involved in politics. However.
my past experience and the work I am eur-
t'ently doing makes the an ideal observer.
What I have seen complcls me to speak out.

[It the presidential election race I am
rrpsct with the way sotrrc people have been
treating Mike ('ot'so's handicap. (‘ertainly
concern over his ability to do the job is
justifiable. 'l o rtre it is clear that the person
trrost qualified to irrdee Mike‘s ability is
Mike lrirtrselt'. l'.\UI)'tltI)' Mike rtrtrst rrtake
countless decisions regal ditty the limitations
imposed on lritrr by his blindness. Before
deciding to run. Mike did c\lettst\e research
oti how his handicap would rttleet his
presidency. Mike has decided that lie is
capable ol harrdlitre the rigors ot the iob.
and I. through trlrsettatirur ol his success at
similar past decisions. ant inclined to
beliete hint. Perhaps it was the necessities
of blindness that taught Mike to make
hottest. open. arid realistic assessments itr
all areas. 'I ltis cotrrbitred w itlr policies. ideas
and ideals which I beliete are right on the
mark. make Mike ('orso my choice tor SA
president.

Whereas the presidential race does irate
trrore than one capable candidate. the \ice-
ptesidetrtiai rttt‘e presents no alternatires. I
hate obsened 1 mi l’eppe at work artd i run
aura/ed that she is running ltrr reelection.
She doesn‘t seem to like what she is doirte

This is contagious. 'I lie rice-presidetrt rtrttst

The EndOrsements

Every year when the ASP endorses candidates, we examine what
we’re looking for. The endorsement is not a beauty COntest. We try
to find the persons we think are besi suited to be SA President and
Vice President. This year we think We have.

We looked for a candidate with a good knowledge of campus al‘--
fairs. We looked for certain personality traits — things with am-
biguious names like leadership, honesty, fairness  .

We also look at a candidate’s stand on certain issues. We asked
the'candidates about ROTC, SA budgeting, campaign policy.

We grilled them on the concrete and on the philosophical.

We tried to look past the campaign posters and find out who this
person really is. We think we found out who the candidates are.

The endorsement is only our opinion, though. When you read
our evaluations and the candidates statements look for what you
want to know.

The endorsement board is made up of editors and jor‘unalists.
We talked to the candidates for a few hours, yelled at each other
for a few hours. and came up with our endorsements. Every one is
free to disagree, of course.

The Endorsement Board consisted of
David Thanhauscr Beth Brinser
Wayne Pccr'eboom Dean Bctz
Edan Levine

p.s. REMEMBER TO VOTE!

Nukes For Thought

During the Second World War. the U.S. discovered the ultimate
killing weapon — the nuclear bomb. Ever since then. the world has
breathed less comfortably. Never before has mart been able to kill
so many so quickly.

The world has not grown more stable iii the past 35 years. More
and more nuclear weapons have been created, giving us the ability
to end life on this planet time and time again.

This week, a group of people are holding activities about nuclear
weapons and about disarmament. The tnore that we realize that
the nuclear threat is here the sooner we will realize that we must
disarm. This week, do some thinking about nuclear war and
nuclear weapons. It can‘t htrrt. Nuclear war cart.
