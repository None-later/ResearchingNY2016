This past Saturday afternoon the
Albany men's varsity team “kept
their cool in bad weather condi-
tions." according to Coach Bob
Lewis. as the squad conquered Mid-
dlebury College 7-2, The victory
brought the nctmcn's spring season
record to a solid 2-l.

“I was real plcascd‘wilh the Mid-
dleltury win." conuncntcd Lewis.
The nrentor had been wary ot' the
fact that this tcanr was playing their
third match in,lhrcc days. and were
facing strong competition to boot.
However. the reigning SUNYAC
chatupions for the past three years
performed up to par.

Perhaps the only Dane who had
reason to by; somewhat t‘rusttatcd
with his most rccent outing was first
singles playc‘r Barry l.c\‘inc. “tt_c

expected when Rl’l \\'ttll 9-5. It was
a 3-2 ball game at the hall' btrt. as
Moira commented. “‘l be second

first trnd \t'CIIlItl quarter and the sc-
eond lrall‘ we were lazy." Moria felt
there were other reasons behind
yesterday's loss. “We played well.
we had started well. but we couldn‘t
hold on to the ball. We‘re not in
shape; we‘re just not in as good
physical condition as we should
be."

“We had plenty of shots on goal.
which was good. bttt we'rc liming tr
problem putting them in the cage."
Motta added.

During the past week the Dane
