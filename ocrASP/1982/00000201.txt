Islanders Top Rangers to Take3-71‘ Series Lead

NEW YORK, New York (AP) Tire .

New York Islanders understand
why they are up three games to one
over the New York Rangers in their
Stanley Cup quarterfinal series.

“Experience.” said Mike Bossy.
who scored once and added two
assists as the islanders topped their
local rivals 5-3 Monday night at
Madison Square Garden.

It was the second straight road
victory in the National Hockey
League matcliup for the islanders
and their third win in a row in the
best-of—sevcn series. which they can
clinch at home Wednesday night.

"Our maturity and experience
have shown the last two games,"
Bossy added "They (the Rangers)

have a lot of new guys without

worked too hard all season and iii
the playoffs to do that."

The Rangers. exhorted by their
fans, gave it their best efforts Sim-
day and Monday. llut it wasn't
enough against the two-time defen-
ding NHL champions.

“it’s just like getting a knife
stuck in you," said Rangers captain
Barry Beck. “We‘ve been playing
the way we want to. but we’re just
coming up short."

Tire Rangers came tip short Mon-
day night becatrse Duane Stittcr
beat goalie Steve Weeks with 7:33
remaining in regulation. Sutter took
a cross-ice pass from Wayne Mer-
rick, cut in on Weeks and crashed
into the goalie — who was making
is second relief appearance of the

Playoff experience. But they .tvott'l. . series ~— as the puck-skidded off the

“I Iiad a little room to cirt in

twice — including the game-winner
irt Game 2. a 7-2 Islander victory.
“Weeks went to pokeclicck anti
there was some room between his
legs. I went for it and it hit the post
and went in. l was surprised to see it
go in."

Islanders Coach AI Arbour
wasn't particularly surprised Strtter

“He‘s a fiery competitor." Ar-
bortr said of Duane. one of four

“We’ve got a team that trusts its

100 percent and they are all confi-
dettl in tne. It’s like a mutual love.
They don't try to do tny job
he'ausc they have the faith in me
that I cati do it."

The Rangers aren't losing any
faith in themselves.

“There have been three one—goal
games against it great Iiockey
team." said Rangers Coach Herb
