Softball Sops

 

To the Editor:

After failing our matli test on Tuesday,

watch the Women’s Varsity Softball game.

 

 

  

One World is Enough

After what happened in our offices yesterday. we feel that we have some explaining to
do.

The First World Coalition had some legitimate gripes. We now realize that the April 2
parody of the New York Pas! was very flawed. The way we treated minorities was insen-
sitive. and for it we apologize. We were trying to expose racism; we ended up as racist.

After the parody came out. we were a little surprised at how little response it got. We
rccieved a letter or two. but nothing prepared us for the treatment we recieved yesterday.

couldn‘t leave. This was more than a sit-in — it was kidnapping. Eventually the “mar-
shals" of the sit-in decided it was a bad idea to kidnap us. so they decided to let us out of
the ofﬁces. but not back in. They make it quite clear that they were ready to make sure we
didn’t come back in — assumabty with force if necessary.

We gathered together most of the editorial board members, and listened to their
