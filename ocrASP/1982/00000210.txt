Dear Daddy's Little Girl,

_ No problem. My light, refreshing Cella Lambrusco,
Btanco and Rosato go beautifully with anything. But
roast beef. baked potatoes and apple pie (1 la mode
would probably go better with Daddy. And it wouldn’t
hurt to have an extra bottle or two on this occasion, all
chilled and ready to drink, no matter what you decide

to serve- Chill-a-Cella!
