By LARRY KAHN

The AMIA intramural softball
program is running out of time. A
University rtile forbids the playing
of intramural games beyond the last
day of classes. but a record number
of teams and a run of bad weather

sciieduling the program before that
deadline nearly impossible. accor-

played on weekends. and one of tile
two remaining weekends before the
deadline will be lost to Celebration

“The way it's going now we will
lose tip to five days front Mayfest."
said liruseo. “That will rob tis of

without a rainout, after Mayfest I
would still have to get in about 40
