By STEPHEN SHAINIMRT

 

 

Many people devoted this past

Holocaust. in which six million
Jews and millions of others were
brutally murdered during WWII.

Special remembrance acti\ ilies were
held throughout the nation. and
Congress has declared the week

of these was the lecture given at the
New York State Museum on April

Several "victims" were sprawled
on the lab roonr floor. red liquid
paste on their skin and wax distor-

Ambulance volunteers tended to
them. splinting and bandagng “irr-

Ambulance corps frorn ()swepo,
Rl’l, Stony Brook. ('ortland.
Syracuse. Rl'l‘ and Albany reacted
to the authentic-looking victims ill a
corrrpctitiorr in which Rl’l and Rl‘l'
tied for first place.

Each corps treated both a
“critically injured" and a “less
seriously injured" victim by im-
plctnenting actual techniques of
splinting, bandaging and use of a
backboard while detailing each step
of the procedure to the audience.

“Although there was a winner, it
was not who is better than whom,
but who could learn from whom."
said Five-Quad executive Lisa
'I'hroop.

lioth the conference and com-
petition centered upon the various
methods of treatment of physical as
well as the emotional trauma in
order to improve the quality of care
offered by university ambulance

Hunter College and Columbia
University. now a visiting professor
here at SUNYA. was introduced.
‘She is author of the novel. The

opened her lecture with an explana-
tion of the cnorrnorrs number of
deaths that occurred during the
Na/i massacres. She asked if one
can‘t grasp the si/c oi' sis tnilliorr
deaths. one cannot grasp the
significance of the Holocaust.

(me of her major themes was that
the Holocaust \vas.nol a unique

UNDERSELLS

She maintained that the “Final

Solution“ was the cornerstone of

Hitler's war policy. citing various
situations in which the war effort
was secondary to the killing of
European Jews.

She denied the charge that the
Jews were either collaborating with
the Germans or passive about their
situation. She asserted people like
to repress the horror of the
Holocaust by finding I'auil willr
those massacred.
