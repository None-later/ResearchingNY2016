Apparantly wrrtrnttg this year's
Academy Award hasn‘t made
Katherine Hepburn any more pa-
tient witlt ill-mannered theater-
goers. Last month. she interrupted
a New York stage performance to
order a patron to remove his feet

burn stopped a show irt Boston by
ordering a woman to leave the
theater for snapping a flasltbulb
during the perforrttance. “Get out
ol' the theater," Hepburn sltouted.
“l'll pay you twice lltc cost of a
ticket to get out of llte theater."

high hoops

When times get tough. hula
hoops start rolling. At least that‘s
the experience of the Wham-o‘Cor-
poration. which introduced the
plastic hoops during the 1958 reces-
sion, and has seen sales go up in
every subsequent economic
slump—including the current one.
Company Vice President Dick
Gillespie says the hoop's counter-
cyclieal popularity may be dtte to
the need for a crazy. inexpensive
fornt of entertainment—but
Wham-o isn't just rclyirtg on the
economy: hoops scheduled to roll
into stores this summer have a new
twist: they smell like peppermint.

boring beards

 

The sytlc-wtttr‘hcrs at the New York
Times are forecasting the death of
another male institution: beards.
The newspaper. quoting local
barbers who say tnore attd tttore
men are shedding their facial hair.
offers a variety of explanations.

  

men are becoming more confident
and don't need beards to prove

'their masculinity. But fashion

scholar Anne Hollander offers a
simpler reason. Says she: “We are
tired of them."

military women

Instead of threatening young men
who don‘t register for the draft.
maybe the government should start
recruiting readers of Glamour
magazine. Nearly 70 percent of the
magavine‘s predominantly female
readers say women should be
drafted. (st) pcrccrtt say women
should be included in combat units
and tltc satttc sumber say they‘d
consider joining the military
themselves. Said one reader. "I‘d
