By MARC SCHWARZ

 

Thc Alhany's‘Statc mcn‘s track

team casin (lcl'catcd Binghantton
95-50 Saturday in Binghatnton.
Led by Eric Newton, who set a
school record in thc 400-tnclcr dash
with a'timc ot'49.6 seconds. Albany
improved it’s otttdoor record to 8-2.

Newton also was instrumental in
Albany's two winning relay teams.
The 440-yard rclay
Newton, Tim Gunther, Mitch Har-
vard and Howard Williams won
with a time of 44.0. Mike Riggins.
Bruce Shapiro. 't‘ony licrrctti and
Newton won the mile relay in
3:25.], the Great Danes" best time
ot‘ the year. Coach Bob Munscy
feels that the relays along with the
other times are just going to get
faster.

Greg Dcdcs led an Albarty swccp
ol‘ the shotput with a throw of l3.40
mctcrs. Mikc Mcrcurio was second
and Russell l-lingcr was third. l'aul
Mancc and (itmthcr captut'cd first
and second in the long jump. Mur-

curio won the discus for the third

consccutivc time with a toss of

45.86 ntctcrs. He is only about four
feet short from qualifying for thc
nationals.

The l5tX)-mclur run we!“ to Scott
James in 4:03.l; Bruce Shapiro
finished second in that racc.
Howard Williams won thc
ZOO-meter dash with a last time ol‘
22.3. Albany took first and sccond
in the 800 meter run; .lamcs won the
race in 1:59.] and Ferrctti was close
bchind with a 2:00.23.

Thc triplc jump saw Mancc winn-
ing with a leap of 12.74 mctct's.
Larry Malian took third in that
event. The pole vault was won by
freshman Ron Jamcrson with a
vault of IS l'cct.

Thc only sour note was a had leg
muscle strain .s'ul'l'crcd by Tim Gun-
thcr. According to Munscy, Gun-
ther will probably miss
Wednesday's tttcct against tradi-
tional rivals Union and RP]. "I
really feel had for Tim. he's a scniol
ttnd hc's coming down to his last
