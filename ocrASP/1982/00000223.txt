The Albany State women's track
and field team finished a solid week
with a sixth palce llnislt in tire Cor-
tland Invitational on Saturday.
Earlier in the week they defeated
Hamilton and Siena ina tri-meet at
home.

Cortland dominated their own

meet on Saturday. taking first place
witlt 147.5 points. Albatty had 40
points; Syracuse, Soutltcrn‘Connee—
ticul. lthaca and Buffalo were also
ahead of the Danes in the to team
field.
“it was a fine placing for us right
tip there with the top learns." said
Albany women’s track coach Ron
White.

The highlight for Albany was the
mile relay in which llarh IIiII. Julie
Smylh. Sue Stern arid Kim Bloomer
raced to a second place finish. The
the ouartet ran the event in 4:073 a
nine second drop from their
previous time. The same fottr run-
ners also finished fourth in the
400—meter relay.

Individually. the four Danes also
fared well, Bloomer took second in
tlte\4t)()-meter dash with but season
best titne ol'5‘).4 seconds, Stern ran
fourth in the 800 meters. llill placed
fourth in the ZOO—meter run and
fifllt It] the ltX)»mcteI dash. and
Srnyth did well in the hurdling
events.

Laurel Stttlifl'e. live lloerncr and
Eileen l’eppard also performed well
in the track events. tn the field
events, Joan McDaid tied a scltool
record with a high jump of 4'10".

Last Tuesday the Danes defeated
Hamilton and Siena on University
Track.

Albany finished with 76 points,
trailed by Hamilton with 65 and
Siena with IS. White called the meet
"a good match-up between two
teatns (Albany and Hamilton) that
are young arid lack depth, but have
very good individual talent."

For the second meet in a row,
Albany captured first place in tert
events. Last Saturday, the women
won 10 of 22 events while hosting
the Albany Invitational. Tuesday
they won IQ of 15 events, led by
three two—time winners.

Stern won the long jump with a
leap of 4.72 meters and the
KOO—meter rttn in a titne of 2:3].6.
Stnyth took both the 100 attd
400-tnetcr hurdles with titnes of

 

Smyth. Stern and Bloomer main-
tained their winning ways with first
place finishes in the 400-meter and
one-mile relays.

The other two winners for
Albany were Boomer in the
400-meter dash with a time of
1:01.” and Ronnie Dann. who set
a personal best in the 3000-meter
race. clocking in at ll:36.04.

Despite the impressive record this .

spring, White does not feel his teattt
is performing up to it‘s full
capabilities: “While we have been
winning, ottr litucs have ttot been
that good. I feel we cart get better
times ottt of the girls."

White was also pleased with ltis ll
rttile relay team. Sarah ('awley.
l’cppard. Sutlil'f and Kim Patch all
ran season bests in 'l‘uesday‘s rueet.

Tomorrow the Danes host
llingltantton and tlten continue on
to the State ehantpitmship tncet this
weekend at St. John‘s. While feels
tltat the team will be ready. "\‘t'e‘te
pointing toward tltal meet." he
said, attd noted that the learn is just
about peaking, now." And it up»
pears to be a stronger peak than in
our outdoor season.
