Stony Brook was awarded the title
on the basis of the second tie-

was necessary. for Albany and
Stony Brook each scored 33 rtins
for the tournament. Total runs
scored was the first tie-breaker.

The Danes opened up the action
on Friday with a 7-0 win over
Binghamton. Freshman Nancy

Wunderiich was the hitting star for
the Danes—two triples and five
RBls. “She's so strong. even if she

gets a bad pitch she can still ptit it

did Carol Wallace. Both liisariian
and Wallace drew special praise

well defensively at first base as well
as getting some key hits in the tour-

by Lynn Truss who hurled a two-hit
shutout.

The second game of the tourney
was a bit disappointing to the

By JOHN MORAN

Robin Tyler can be as hilarious

 

_ and outrageous as Lenny Brtrce or

Richard Pryor. bill the similarities
end there. She is a Jewish feminist
lesbian who cracked her jokes last
night in the PAC Reciital Hall.

“Humor is the ramr sliarp edge
of truth." she told the audience of »
about 100. She began her perfor-
mance reminding the crowd that
Jesus was Jewish. “and people
forget that."

She told the small btrt en-
thusisastic crowd that only a man
whould have written the song
“Silent Night" because “when a
woman is in labor it is not a silent
night." To dramatize this she coax-
ed the qirdiencc itt singing the song
while she laid on her back on a

piano bench and supplied the
screams of labor.
“After Mary was finished

pushing and the baby was born she
screamed. ‘Jesus Christ!‘ ". She ad-
ded that this bit didn't go over well
when she performed at Mormon
CollegeI

Tyler, who has been performing
as a comic for over l5 years and has
released 3 albums covered a variety
of areas including the Reagatis. the
art of comedy. the women's move-
trient. and lesbianism.

“Ronald Reagan has given me a

r whole new career. I kno'w riitiny of

you are getting your student aid eitt
biit some of Us" have to survive."
she said.

She had no kind words for Nuticy
Reagan. “Nancy has the personali-
ty of a snail on valittrn. She tilts
formed a support group called
Ladies against Women."

Her style is one of bouncing from
one story to another so quickly that
she asked a member of the audience

to help her to keep frotn digressing
too often.

Tyler told the audience about her
experience at age to when she saw a
.man‘s "thing." “i was very naive.
He took it out and i saw two big
pirrple tumors below it. i thought
he only had six months to live." She
told him she wouldn't take off her
clothes unless he got out of the car.
Site insists she drove away.

Site related the difficulty of being
gay in Winnipeg. Canada as a
young woman. “i told ttiy mother
and she started to take it well after
sitting sliiva."

She uses words like faggot nntl
dyke to take away the on'us in the
same way Lenny Bruce used offen-
sive language.

Once arrested for female imper-
sonation iii New York she qttipped.
"Why shouldn't I be it I'ettittle iui<
persouuior —— l’hyllis Slial'ley is."

t

She added. “I agree with the right-
to-lifers — if you don‘t they‘ll kill
you." ' '-

“A man once asked me. 'You
sleep with women. Does that mean
you hate. men?‘ I said. ‘You sleep
with women. [)0 you hate men?’ “

Throughout the night the
predominately female audience
responded warmly to Tyler and she
ribbed the men about doing
"crotch cheeks" (“it's still there“)
during the performance.

Near the cttd of the show she
began to get serious about the state
of comedy. “Television uses you rip
like fast food. Most iiunidr on T.V.
Icall disco humor. It'sjust first. ott-
ly occasionally t'uti_ny. and makes
no attempt to define the truth.“

She continued."tlutnor‘ is based
oti anger and anger is a healthy
emotion. Anyone who isn't angry
today ntust be era/y." Tyler closed
the show singing a .Iudy (iarltititi

imitation and received an en-

I thtrsiastic applause.

After the show she praised
Richard Pryor as theeornle gentin
of our era. “He can admit when
he's wrong. as he dld\ about. Itltr
remarks on women." She said that
he told the authentic at It perfor-
mance she saw that tie is not going

Tyler feels that l’ryor was tllslllt‘
ed by many people when he started
conveying the Black experience our-
side of the norm for black come»
dians.

"He was being true to his ex-
perience just as l have to be true to

be truthful on stage."

A boycott of le has been
organized by SASU representative
Scott Wexler iri response to a new
policy requiring bus riders to show
their SUNY le beginning on May
3.
Wexler said students will be able
“to pick tip green urmbtinds at most
bus stops during the morning and
all day in SA (CClttrY' to wear in
protest.

"We're ttrgitig students not to
harass the bits drivers. just to rcfttse
to show their le" said Wexler.
“Proeecd on Monday. May 3 as if it
were Friday April 30" before the
policy 'ilS implemented.

Wexler "is convieed this is step

one in the bus fees". He believes
(Plant Operations Manager Dimnis)
Stevens is a slick administrator. he
realizes this is a way to get students
used to being checked."

Stevens said ti major reason for
the policy was a safety precaution
against non-University members
who have threatened the safety of
SUNY students.

"However." said Wexler. “ac-
cording to the Administration at
SUNY Central and (officer) John
l'leniglian (of SUNY Public Safety)
whatever incidents are occurring are
at night not dtrring the rush hours
of day." Wexler believes "carding
students on buses will not have any
effect oti buses."

Students Confront

Ily JOHN MORAN

A group of seventeen students
from all over the state converged
Wednesday on a SUNY Board of
Trustees meeting to demand the
Trustee address the issue of Gay
and Lesbian rights.

    

 

 

.....~...-....-..--.<...-v.

Agreed to formal discussions

    

 

As a rcsttlt. SUNY Chancellor
Clifton Wharton agreed for the first
time to iitilti full formal discussions
oii gay and lesbian issues.

The action was organized by the
SUNY Coalition of Lesbian and
(lay Students and SASU to
demonstrate the need for a SUNY-
widc nori-discrittiiriatioti policy bas-
ed oti sexual or uffectiotitil
preference. The students. both
homosexual ntid heterosexual. came
from Bitigliartttotr. ()rieouta. and
New York us well as Albniiy.

The SUNY Coalition of Lesbian
and Gay Students decided tilt a
direct confrontation with the
trustees because Wharton had been
unresponsive to two years of writ-
ten requests from the Coalition to
meet with him. ‘

Tire Trustees “had "heard it
rumor" that a group was coming
and had taken extra security steps
“as a usual precaution" according
to Robert Perrin. Vice Chancellor

for University affairs. Access was

“My greatest concern.“ lic sand.
“is not to destroy bus service. We
want to show Dennis (Stevens)
Monday that‘ he can‘t 'cnforee'thisv
policy. it's just too much of a has-
sle." ' s . '

SA President-elect Mike (Torso
said he was “upset Stevens didn't
ask for any student input."

According to Curse. Stevens said
there was no lies with tiny bus fees
at all.

“Safety is most itrtportatil." said
Corso. “there's sortie validity to
what he (Stevens) is saying. If that's
all he is going to do. tlicti back liitii
rip i()0 percent. But. I‘m going to
keep on top of it."

Wexicr believes the reason buses
are crowded is not due to non-
University tiiembcrs itsirig the bus
service bill because tltere aren't
