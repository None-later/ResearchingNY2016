fort to attract minorities?

A: Yes we have. Last year we
worked witlt Howard Strakcr. He
wrote a number of articles for us.
that was part of an attempt to get
more minorin writers at the ASP.

' Blacks won't see it as a white per-
son's paper. We have had a number
of black writers come and go.

0: If no one comes forward. is it
the ASP's responsibility to seek out
minority reporters?

A: Yes. it is the ASP's respon-
sibility to seek otit minority involve-
ment.

0: During the sit-iii were the
negotiations conducted under
duress?

A: That depends what you call
duress.

0: During the negotiations. pro-
duction was cfl‘cctivly halted. Why
did you let negotiations continue as
long as there were people holding
up production of the ASP?

A: Well. there were very few
alternatives. It would have been
ridiculous to call in the cops and
very counter—productive to what we
wanted and what they wanted. It
would have been stupid. i felt that
the problems could be resolved in a
reasonable amount of time. so we
could still get the paper out. which
happened.

0: Don‘t you think you set a
iliirigcioiis precedent by allowing
the production to tlte paper to be
stopped'.’

A: No. this was an c.\ii‘cine. the
kick isstie was an cstrciiic. the reac-
tion was an extreme and I don't see
it happening again. if someone
comes in with an outrageous dc-
niand. we‘ll have them kicked out
of the office.

0: Do you think the sit-iii and
what came otit of it will help or
hinder race relations on caiiipus‘.’

A: It's hard to say. I've heard a
lot of white people are angry at
what happened. Hopefully what‘s
lioing to happen is that more blacks
are going to become active in the
ASP and that will help hlaeks all
over campus.

0: The ASP has been ii chairi-
pion for another albeit non-ethnic
minority. the gays, vis a vis the
ROTC discriiitination affair. Did it
never occur to the ASP that there
are others out there?

A: Of course. we have covered
other issues. We've covered minori-
ty issues well. perhaps not excep-
tionally, but I think well.

0: President O'Leary did not de-
nounce the April Fools’ Issue until
the sit-in. How would you
characterize his non-reaction until
the sit-in happened?

A: He claims he didn't read the
issue until it was brought to his at-
tention. That sounds pretty bogus
to me. I'm sure it came st'OSS his
desk before then. That statement
was supposed to be on campus
racism. It wasn't. it was about the
kick issue. That is one thing l‘in
pissed off about.

0: Do you think every institution
on this campus has what you would
called in an editorial “subdued
racism"?

A: I think so. Probably about the
same as the ASP‘s — Gill's Wits 11"

insensitivity. a hick of knowledge of

just how deep racial tension is on
this campus.
Q: ()ii various TV news reports.

Saturday

 

a member of the First World Coali-
tion appeared. but how come
nobody from the ASP?

A: We didn‘t have time. We were
busy negotiating. It would have
looked a lot better if one of us ap-
peared in the local media. but we
didn‘t have time. They had their
deadlines and they didn‘t meet with
out negotiating schedule.

0: How can people look at this
and see that the agreement was
basically achieved through in-

timidation and take any credence in .

it? .
A: The agreement is essentially
nothing. What they got was a front-
page apology, which I still stand
behind. That‘s all they got, of any
solid. tangible. credible concession
. . . I'm very pissed off at the way
they went about this by not eotiiing
tip and talking. I would have liked
them to have said. “Look. we had a
meeting. There‘s ahoirt a hundred
of us. we‘re pissed. we want to sit
down and talk to you and tell you
our concerns.“ that didn't happen.

They had a good time playing
militant fora day, bill it was at our
expense and it was at the sludcttls‘
expense. I’ull it on somebody who's
deserving.

urrOund Racial Issue

Vincent

0: Are you sympathetic with
what were the motivations of the
sit-in? ‘

A: If you mean by the motiva-
tions. the sense ofoutruge reactions
_that minority students felt. I c_ould
understand that.

Q: Do you endorse the nieihods
of the sit-in?

A: No. I don't particularly en-
dorse sit-ins. in general, anything

-that interferes with the functioning

of society. is a problem. Do I
understand why minority students
did that? Yes. I do. Their view. and
l have talked to tltern. was they had
no other way of making their point.

0: Do you think that they could
have achieved what they wanted to
in ii more mainstream way?

A: I don‘t know. I think that the
iiiiportani thing was that ilie sit-iii
was relatively orderly. It was
relatively brief and peacefully citd-
ed.

Q: The statement you made on
racism Monday: was that planned, i
or was it an afterthought to what
happened‘.’

A: During the course of (the sll-

O’Leary

in). it became known to me that
minority students were concerned
with two things in particular with
me. One was a statement about that
particular issue of the ASP.
Secondly, they were concerned that
I would speak to the campus in
general about racism. That was part
of the way the whole thing was settl-
ed.

0: Why did you wait for the sit-
iii to occur to denounce the issue?

A: Unfortunately. I didn‘t see
that issue. l saw a copy the night of
Telethon. It was lying on a table. I
simply glanced at it. Mayor Corn-
ing. in fact. tirade a reference to a
picture in it. and we laughed at that.
_l assure you that it' I had read that
ASP. i would have made a state-
inciit a lot earlier.

0: No one had brought it to your
attention iii the three weeks‘.’

A: No one moved it to me rapid-
ly. I would have responded.

Q: Have you found that the ASP
has been guilty of similar iiifi‘ac»
tions in the past?

A: From time to time user the
years. tlicie ha\e been lapses in the

ASP. ' i

Q: Is racism a lingering problem
on this campus?

A: it is.

0: _'In the student body as a
whole?

A: We could spend a good deal
of time on what you mean by
racism.

0:00 most whites on campus
dislike blacks and vice versa?

A: Most whites. I do not believe.
dislike most blacks. That’s not the
issue of racism though racism is not
an intention. but an act. for exam-
ple. I could say. “but I did it as a
joke." Did the person dislike him?
No. Was it racist? Yes. There’s a
difference about how youthing and
what you do.

Do the editors of the ASP in-
dividually dislike black people? Of
course they do not. I've talked to
them; it was my belief.

Q: Do you feel that the sit-in
could have exacerbated race rela-
tions on campus?

A: There‘s always the danger of
an action getting a reaction. l'in
determined not to have it occur. i
think most students are determined
to try and create here a system
whereby the behaviors of people are
less percehed as causing racial tert-
sioii.

()ne of the problems with a sit-in
is that you get people who resent it
