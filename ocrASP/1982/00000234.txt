the photograph which reads “the broad

jumps" and features Muricl Hemingway
hurdling. ~
in his review. Rossicr claims. that Townc
is not voyeuristic yet i found his consistent
close-ups of women's crotchcs and groups

’ of naked women in a steam room cxtrcmcly

offensive. in a major interview in Playboy
magazine (hardly an avenue of expression
which one respectful of women would take)
Townc described a scene in his movie
stating. “I had anOIhcr camera on these
girls. focusing on their crotchcs. getting big-
ger and bigger as they got closer and closer
until it was just an eye close-up of two
great-looking pussies." i find no dit‘fcrcncc
in his attitude and that of other por-
nographic film makch who objcclil'y
women's bodies.

The women’s coach in the film. witorn
Rossicr commends highly. is actually vcry
destructive of the women. He is cxtrcmcly
jealous of the relationship bctwccn the
film's main characters Chris Calri/l (Rossicr
even got the name wrong) and Tory Skin-
ner. Hc pits them against each other. ac-
cuses Tory ol' injuring Chris, tries to force
himself upon Chris. laments the fuel that
he's stuck coaching womcn who care about
each other and arcn‘l tlrc hurdcncd athletes
hc wants them to be and ultimately destroys
the women's relationship.

Rossicr also convicntly misses the just of
Townc‘s ccntral theme that Chris can only
become completely mblurc when she ac-
quircs hcr.(in Rossicr's words) “charming,
supportive. preppy boyl'ricnd." The two
meet in a gym whcrc lltc boy cannot keep
his‘cycs off Chris‘ body in a pool or off of
her crotch while hr: lays beneath her lifting
weights. How Rossicr could miss this Oh-
vious objectification of a woman's body is
beyond me. Of course. Chris nccds this
man's support. and not hcr own or that of
her womcn friends. to win at the Olyntﬁics.
hence, hcr maturity and success is con-
tingent upon her dependence on a man.

Obviously. Towuc's themes and depic-
tion of women arc no different front those
of countless other misogynistic films and
the fact that Personal Best is billed and
reviewed as being "rcspcctful of women" is
absolutely infuriating.

You Can’t Fool Me

To the Editor:

[highly question Dennis Stcvcn's motives
for instituting a mandatory SUNYA-lD
check before boarding the SUNYA “grccn
machines.” Mr. Stevens claim that a lot of
non-University members are riding the
buses might be true to 11 degree. but i feel
this is just a continued effort by Mr.
Stevens and the Plant Department to even-
tuully charge Off-Campus Students (and
maybe all students) for bus service. By rc-
quiring SUNYA students to show their
10's. 1 fch Mr. Stcvcns will probably sug-
gest a “bus pass" in the fall. and finally
charge students a fee to obtain these
"passes."

The rcason's Mr. Stcvcns gives for im-
plementing this policy (which has always ex-
isted but has never been enforced) such as
increased student safety and creating more
seats for-SUNYA students are very vague
and i believe deceiving.

First of all. if someone not attending
SUNYA attempted to board a bus. what
could the driver do to stop him/her? Throw
him off physically? Or refuse to move the
bus and ﬂag down an Albany Police of-
ficcr’l Or ask students riding ‘lhc bus to
throw the person off? All of thc prcccding
cxumplcs an: absurd and forcing a driver to
choose arty one of those options would
reduce the ct'ficicncy 0f the bus syslcm cvcn
further. Frankly. l fch that there arc t'cw
nort»Univcrsity person's riding our buscs.
The Sum: workers who purk their curs in
the lot next to thc ilcilrnun 'l'ltcutcr itnvc
charted buses (supplicd by tile Stulc) to
their offices and tltcy do not udvcrscly cf-
l'cct the operation of our buses anyway
since. in the morning (if thcyrcvcn bourd ottl'

 

buses) they 'arc going downtown. when
students are trying to come uptown (the
converse is true for the afternoon). is in-
creased student safety a good reason for
having lD's chcckcd? Many pcoplc ride the
CDTA buses and l havc heard few. if any.
incidences occuring on thcir buscs. By in-
suring that a bus is all SUNYA students
docs that really guarantee sul'cly'.’ I am sure
more incidents have occurer on SUNYA
buscs bciwccn SUNYA students than with
outsiders. Forcing us to show our ID's will
increase the time it takes to board the buscs
and cause even further delays in at system
that is already plagued with delays.

No. Mr. Slcvcns this is one SUNY-
Albany student you iiavc not fooicd by in-
stituting a mandatory 10 check.

Sit-in Support

To the Editor:

After reading your Cdll0fliil (April 23) l
wondered how you would fuel it' litc sumc
coalition look over Prcsidcnl ()‘l.carys' of-
t'icc. Would you say they had givcn no prior
warning? Would you criticizc their action?
Would you say they had stormcd his office?
As a paper you have the power of freedom
of the press. which scents lb makc you im—
mune from attacks by tlutsc groups which
you purport to advocate. it sccrns that as a
paper of new ideas and students rights you
can not relate to it group of sitrdcnls trying
to amend a wrong in rm active and political
manncr. Why didn‘t you prolcsl the sit-in
at the Follcl's SUNY bookstore as int-
proper?

if i were the ASP 1 would congratulate
those sludcnts who acted in such a way as to
cxplcss their beliefs to the largest number of
people in the Quickest way possible.

No Joke

ou really can’t fault Dennis Stevens for his timing.
He’s very good at the little tricks that make ad-
ministrators the people they are. He realizes how important

the buses are to students. He knows that students will not accept
bus fares. especially for a bus system that’s woefully inadequate.

He understands the opposition students and drivers have against

mandatory lD checks. He knows they see it as an attempt to get
everyone used to the idea of showing a pass to get on the bus —— on-
ly later you'll have to pay extra for the pass.

The slcazicst time to move against students is right before finals,

it’s right before finals. and Dennis Stevens has moved against the
students.

He claims that. too many non-students are packing our buses.

The only real problems with non-students on buses have happened
at night, and on weekends. it is justifiable to check for iDs then ——
safety is important.

The safety argument doesn't stand up to crowds packing into

the green monsters to catch that 9:45. it doesn‘t make sense to en-

force thc 1D checks during peak times - thcrc‘s just not enough

time and it’s unnecessary. Safety isn’t a problem during peak

times, only at night. y

it does make sense to check for le if those le are going to be

replaced with bus passes you have to buy. it looks a lot like Dennis

Stevens wants us all to get used to the idea of showing a pass, er.

1D card to gain accss to the buses.

When the new policy starts Monday. plan to ignore it. Join the
1D boycott. if students decide that showing le during peak time
is a waste of time, we might be able to stop Stevens‘ latest attempt

’ to get us used to the idea of pay buses.

As they say, timing is essential to comedy. Sicvcns’ latest idea to

prepare us for the era of pay buses is a joke. Laugh a little at it

Monday with the rest of us.
