Isles Win V5-2

(AP) Bob Bourne'had a halfway
complete description of why the
New York islanders are two vic-

.tories away from quaiitying for

their third straight Stanley Cup
finals.

“We're a‘ cool team," said
Bourne. They also have a ‘hot
goaltender. That combination - the
islanders’ ability to remain calm
even when they’re being outplayed
and Bill Smith’s spectacular play in.
goal - sparked the two-time defcn--
ding National Hockey League
champions to a 5-2 victory over the
Quebec Nordiqucs Thursday night.
The islandch lead the best-of—7
semifinal series 2-0 with the third
and fourth games set for Quebec
City on Saturday and Tuesday
nights.

Led by Mike Bossy’s two goals, a
goal and two assists by Bournc and
the nctruinding of Smith. the
islanders subdued Quebec cvcrt
though they weren't at their best for
the first two periods. At the end of
40 minutes, New York was on top
3-2 and the islandch totally shut
down the Nordiqucs' high-powered
offense in the final pcriod.

“This learn scares mc." Bournc
said of the Nordiqucs, who upsct
Montreal and Boston to gel to the
Wales Conference finals. “They are
explosive and i’m afraid if we let
down. they could get up 5-i or 5-2
on us and kill us."

Black Hawks, 41-1

(AP) Playoff intensity was one cx-
cusc given for the penalties and
lights which marred a 4-1 Chicago
Black Hawks victory ovcr the Van-
couver Canttcks on a pair of third-
pcriod goals by high-scoring Dcnis
Savard.

Savzirrl broke tlic gatnc open with
a goal at 4:42 of the final period
and then added a power-play score,
his iOIh goal of the playoffs. at
16:23.
