ID Boycott is Called Successful

I‘ll "RINSER V

 

 

Yesterday marked tltc first day of

the new policy rcqtririttg btts riders
to show their SUNYA ll)s upon re-
quest.

Howcver. tltc day was marked by
art lD boycott which was “suc-
cessful lit the sense that it idetttificd
what the exact situation was." ac-
eordirtg to SASU representative
Scott Wexler.

The 11) boycott irtvolvcd students
not showing tltcir ll)s and wearing a
grectt armband in protest of the
policy.

\chler said he had assumed that
the policy required all riders to
show ll)s. “lint. while at several
different bits stops between 8
rt.m. and 11 n.m.." said Wesler.
"l satv two thirds of the bus drivers
blatantly ignoring the policy."

Plant Operations Manager Detr-
tris Stevens said he “didn't ex-
perience any problems" with the
new policy. He reported f‘ntost peo-
ple were generally cooperative. over
60 pcrccttt of the riders showed
their IDs.” -

One student who did not show
his ii) is Rich lit'fros. He said he got
on a bus yesterday tnortting and the
btrs driver waited five rnitttttes for
him to show his ID. lil'fros said he
“got off the bus because he didn't

want to hold other students tip."

However. when Effros boarded
the 2:50 p.tn. Alumni Bus (tto. 49)
the bus driver did not cvert ask
anybody t'or ID.

Effros felt there was “no set plan
iii the bus drivers." He believes the
busdrivers “already use their discre-
tion" irt deciding who are SUNYA
students and who are now
Urtivcrsily.ridcrs.

Stevens reported that bus drivers
had “turned away around fifty
non-University people."

According to Weslcr. one of the
primary reasons for the ll) boycott
was because the ID policy is a step
toward' implementing a bus I'ce.

Stevens said that “he. along with
Vice-President of Finance attd
llusinr. .tohn llartigatt ltavc rttndc
it clear that there will be no bus fee
for the 1982-83 year."

“’l‘ltey‘ are mixing the two
issues." said Stevens. “but. 1 cart
see the connection.”

Stevens said there was “no way
to predict tltc '83-'84 year" cottccr~
ning possible bus fees at that time.

Bus Driver Micltacl Vartttli said
he had been cltccking 1D with no
problems btrt he has put off those
who did not cooperate.

Vartuli reported an ittcident in
which a stttdcrtt showed his Hudson
Valley Community College (HVC)

PRESS

ldcrttification Card. The student
said herode the SUNYA httscs
becattsc his brother. a SUNYA stu-
dent. did. Vartuli said the student's
brother was not with him at the
time and the llVC student did not
have a guest pass.

Another bits driver. .lattct Argit’is
said “the kids have been
cooperating." She said she
“doesn't know what it's about. 1
know when we're handling SUNYA
students."

Weylcr' believes the “policy is so
blatantly left open to the drivers‘
discretion. Why waste otrr time'.’
The drivers are going to know who
is a student and vvlto is not."

According to Stevens. tlte drivers
were pleased \\illt vvhat happened
yesterday. He said the night drivers
will he trrotc routinely asking for
ll)s.

“ The decision was made with one
trrotivc itr mind." said Stevens.
“anti that was safely."

Stevens also said he added two
buses to the routes yesterday just itt
case liretc were any slow-ups as a
result of the It) boycott because the
object was “not to delay students.“

SA President-elect Mike Corst
said he was "upset about the tvvr
buses" becauch Stevens fouttd th
money for yesterday‘s extra scr'vie
btrt not for improved daily service.

(.‘orso believes tltc 1D system is
“not going to do what it
p roposcd. ‘ ‘

Mandatory Students Course Evaluation Delayed

A proposal which calls t'or man-
datory. University-wide student

cvalttatiort of all courses and pro-
fessors was delayed until next fall
by the (‘ommittcc on Evaluation
Policy (CEP).

Approximately 12.500 cclcbrartt
Celebration ’82 a success in the eyes of the event's organizers.

Last week. the proposal which
would use lltc criteria approved by
the Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) was referred to nest fall's
EPC by the CEP. 1n the meantime
the CEP plans to draw up a corn-

The proposal was introduced by

“1 was very pleased with the wltole thing." said University Concert lloard President Dan Pozin. one of the
chieforganizers of the cvcttt. “We had virtually no problems. The bands (A Flock of Seagulls. Toots arid the
Maytals attd Squeeze), the crowd and everybody involved ltad a great little."

Pozin cited sortie tttirtor problettrs dtrrittg tltc course of the afternoon. A prof

's‘iotttti jugglcr‘s tnachetes

 

were taken away by sccttrity as a precautionary measure. Pozin said. The UCl! President also said some fence
jumpers got in artd the crowd tnighl have pushed over an outltottse before or dttrittg the event. Pozin did not
know about arrests made dtrring Cclebratiort ’82.

But according to University Police. there were a few arrests made during Celebration ’82. An Albany High
student was arrested for damaging a porta-john. Also. a non-student was arrested for breaking a Seneca Hall

window.

According to Pozin. UCB hired University Police and sortie Pinkerton guards to be a security force during
the concert. He believed there was enotrglt of a patrol to keep tlte crowd tinder control.

After the concert the trash accumulated was cleaned up itt less titan tit/o hours, Pozin said. “The trash crews
were psyched and ready for clean-up after the event." '

“Because of the smoothness of the whole event we see no reason to change the format." Pozin said.

strategy.

“ [here are a tttrrttbcr of faculty
who are very strongly opposed at
arty tittre to mandatory
evaluation." ltc said. "l'rn afraid
the cotttrttittcc's (CEP) decision to
forttt a policy is just a way of deny-
ittg students their rigltt to have
courses attd professors evaluated."

Further. Koli feels the commit-
tee‘s action will cause tltc delay of
tire decision concerning the matter
at least one and a half years unless
(next year's) sludcnt Senator‘s push
it hard." '

"I‘m hoping lil’C introduces this
into the Senate by September." said
chrin. “Although i think it's a
good bill. it has it slim chance to
receiving faculty approval."

The usefulness of ClEIl’ has been
questioned by Koli. "Tltc Corntnit~
tee has bectt around for so long. but
they ltavc not yet succeeded itt for-
nting a University-wide policy."
said Koli. “l‘ttr doubtful the
students can trtrsl them."

The bill also called for publica-
tion of the evaluation results which
would be available at the Main
Library. the Offices of the Center
for Undergraduate Education and

itt the offices of the Student
Assoeiation.

Members ot' the Committee. ac-
cording to its rttirtutes. feel a corn-
prchcnsitc policy is “needed in
order to address the issues attd cott-
ccrtts surrounding instructional
evaluation on campus."

The USP hopes to ittcitrdc itt its
policy statement:

> the purposes of the evalua—
tion:

> Who shall have access to
tire evaluation;

>- The lirnitations of
evaluation;

> What shall be the content
and l'orrn of the evaluation;

> How the policies will be ap-
plied.

Wepritt believes these issues have
alr'ndy been addressed in tire pro-
posrrl.

“The purpose of the bill.” said
Weprin, “is to give teachers the op
portunity to know what's working
and what is not. It also enables
students to know what the classes
and the professors are all about."

The Cltair of CEP. Frank Pogue.
was unavailable for comment.
