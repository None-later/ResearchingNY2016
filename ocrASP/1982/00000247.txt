Warren Wray. who had two goals
and six assists. were named offen-
sitc MVI"s by (‘oach Mike Motta.
Defensncly he did not gite out an
award because "we weren't on
defense all that much." Freshman
goaltender Alan Cornicld had
another stellar performance rnukiitg
l2 saves on IS shots. The 80% sate
ratio will raise his season mark to
68% which is already urnortg the na-
tion‘s leaders.

Albany was able to keep control
of the game all four quarters.
something they have rarely been
able to do this season. Albany in-
ct‘ tscd their halftime lead of 9-3 by
scoring one goal iii the third and
finished off tltc scoring with three
tallies in the fourth period,

“We played a lot better tltan we
have been." said Coach Motta.
"We had it on offense. they tllart-
wick) only did one thing on defense
and it was not working. so we corr-
trolled offensively. We played well
for four periods. but they also were
a weak learn."

The Duties will try to end the
season tilt an up note with games
against ()nconta. ('olgatc and
I’otsdam. “
