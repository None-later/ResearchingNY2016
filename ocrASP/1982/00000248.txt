Albany State's women‘s track
team competed this weekend iii the
New York State A.1.A.W. Cham-
pionsltip. better known as the State
nteet. held at St. John‘s University
in New York City. it was a tough
meet against sonte even tottglter

John‘s, who placed first with 124
points. However. Albany came
t h r o u g it and. with 24 points,
'tied for rtintlt place overall with

Coach Ron Wltite was very pleas-
ed witlt tlte team's overall effort
artd witlt tlte excellent individual ef-
forts displayed by tlte women. In
the trials Kirtt Bloomer placed

Bloomer broke her otvn record of
59.08 ttrtd ran 58.08 iii the
400»mctcr dash which qttalifies her

for the national championship on
May 20. .

White feels that Bloomer‘s im-
provement was due" to lter taking
the first half ol' her race fast. “Site
went out in the first 200 of her race
in 26.04. which she has been work-
ing on for a while. This is her event.
which she will be rutttting in the Na-
tionals.“ White rentarked l'urther
on Bloomer‘s accomplishment-of
placing fourth in this race: “To

an amazing achievement."

great weekend by qualifying for the

White commented on Stern‘s
strategy
quite different fromwhat it was in-

This has helped Sue quite a bit with

~For 19 years Peggy Mann has
been coach of the women's tennis
team and in 19 years the women's
tennis team has not had a losing
season. But Coach Mann is retiring
al'tcr this season and she might have
to retire on a losing note.

After dropping a match Sunday
afternoon to Cottcordia. 6-3. the
squad's record stands at 2-3. If their
coach is to leave on. at least, an
even note. they nttrst defeat
Binghamton this afternoon.

Peggy Mann Retires

>continuetlfrom buck page
a part-Iittte coach. “l‘ut a little ntad
that they are only getting a part—
titttc coaclt." stated Mann.

The next \vontctt‘s coaclt may ort-
ly be part»titue tllltl may rtot ltavc
the coaching abilities 01' Peggy
Mann. bill they probably will
maneuver the van better' on road
trips. All of Mann's players have a
van story to tell. One which they all
recall ltappettcd recently itt
Binghanttort. Mann was drivirtg the
van looking for someone to ask
directions for the proper courts.
When she finally located a prospec-
tive person she stopped the van. on
an incline. and quickly got out of
the van. Unfortunately to all riding
with Mann. the van was left itt

,drive. Luckily on alert lsaacs quick-

ly threw the van into park before
arty harm could be done to players
or van.

Mann might be hanging up the
tennis racket at Albany State. bttt
by no means is she retiring front
tennis life. Next winter she will be

teaching at John Gardner's Tennis _

Ranch itt Scottsdale. Arizona. and
she will continue to umpire tour-
rtantents. Alsr Mann competes
twice a week itt two leagues against
players under 40. “Sometimes i win
attd sometimes i lose." corttrttcttts
Mann about contpetition versus
players sliglttly yourtgcr titan site.
The veteran coach's expertise ex-
tends beyond tennis. As art
William and
Mary. Mann played field ltockcy
and basketball. in lter early days at
Albany slte taugltt field hockey at
Brubucher l-lall. Bttt her knowledge

doesn‘t cttd there. either. A tennis
tournament in Rocltcster saw her
little known skill. As the other
tcartts waited to play they studied
calculus itt one corner or another
subject itt another cortter. lt1 one
spot itt the lockcrroom sat the
Albany women's tennis coach. ttot
tutoring political science. or even
going over coaching strategy. bttt
there sat Peggy Mann teaching her
team the fundamentals of poker!

Coach Mann is ttndoubtedly lov-
ed and respected by her tennis
students and players. attd just as
importantly. by her constituents.
Men's tennis coach Robert Lewis
had this to say about Mann: "I've
worked with Coach Mann for ten
years and 1 could say we have a very
good relationship. It is one of
mutual respect and cooperation.
l'm going to miss her."

Athletic Director and head foot-
ball coach Bob Ford ltas also work—
ed with Mann and has only positive

feelings towards the retiring coach: .~

“She is a class woman. Without
hesitation 1 can say 1 love Peggy
Mann and site is a phenomenal
huntan being who is well-respected
irt her field."

Peggy Mann ltas travelled the
world due mostly to a sport that she
'loves attd loves lter back. All those
Iwho have worked with her and for
her have a deep love and respect for
:the veteran tennis coach of SUNY-
Albany.

' it is probably Peggy Mann who

., sumttted up lter career best by simp—

ly saying: “Tennis has been very
,good to me.“
