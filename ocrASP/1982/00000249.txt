Danes Split Twinbill Against Oneonta, 15—4,.3-4
Red Dragons Score Late to Win Opener; ‘ " ' '
Albany Gets Revenge in Nitecap Victory

 

By MARC HASPEL

___.___.________.._

You can‘t win many ball games
by giving up leads late in thc game.
In fact. it's nearly impossible. and
it’s been a problcnt that has been
plaguing Albany coach Mark Col-
lins and ltis men's lttlsebttll team of
late.

After losing both ends ol'a heart-
breaking doubleheader to Siena in
the last inning. the Danes visited
Onconta Saturday and irt the first
game did the same thing. Albany
lost 4-3 to the Red Dragons by

doubleheader) singled in Rich
Wander for the second run. But the
Red Dragons came back to score
three runs on a two-run triple that
tied the game and it successful
squeeze play to bring heme the win-
ning run.

“lt's disappointing.“ said Col-
lins. "Each game we were ahead by
two runs (including the Sierra
games) going irtto the last inning.
We haven‘t been able to keep orrr

heads with a lead in the last
inning."
' But the Danes bounced back

after the opening defeat to win the
second game by an eleven-run
margin. ’

"It was about time to get angry
and take it out on somebody." Col-
lins said. “it just happened to be
Oneonta at the time."

Albany exploded in the second
inning with seven runs. led by
Roscn's two-run single. Rosen had
six Rlit‘s on the afternoon.

The Danes received another big
blow in the top of the fifth inning as
senior designated hitter Bobby

years ago that Coach Mann pttt up
a notice to start a women's tennis
club at Albany State. "Three girls
came otrt that first year and We
would play local colleges. At the
end of the match I would play the
other coach and both learns would
get together for punch. “it was very
informal," reminisccs Mann.

way from the days of tea and
crumpets. Next year the women's

but came alive with a three for four
performance. “Everybody was hit-
ting the ball. Everybody was chipp-
ing in." said Collins.

Albany's record now stands at
8-7, wlticlt docs rtot qualify tltcm
for post-season SUNYAC competi-
tion; the Cortland Red Drttgons will
represent the Eastern Division in
this year‘s playoff. Collins is still
hoping that the ECAC will consider
the Danes for its playoff tourna-
ment.

“We have a sltot at the ECAC‘s.
but we'll have to wait to find out if
tltcy want us to represent them (in
the upper New York rcgion).“ said
Collins.

The Danes face Union College at
University Field today for what
Collins calls "the Capital District

learn will see another change, the
coach. Mann will be retiring to tltc
easy life of golf and bridge after a
long and fruitful career.

Although Coach Mann has been
coaching tennis for n long while.
that doesn't mean she will not miss
it. “i will especially miss being
friends with college age kids. They
have young ideas and that keeps me
young. Many times I feel like a
rnotltcr to them," explained Mann.

Mann hasthree sorts of her own.
One son is graduating Albany
Medical College this spring and
another is a Washington reporter
for the Los' Angeles Times.

From the list of awards Mann has
accumulated one can easily draw
the conclusion that her service to
tennis does rtot begin and end at the
Albany campus. Mann's father was
the chief umpire at Forest Hills. and

she began urnpirirtg there when she
was sixteen.

For the past l2 years she has
refereed the Eastern Collegiatcs
Tournament. Being the referee of a
tournament assumes mu’clr
responisbility. You are basically in
charge of the entire totrrnarncnt and
nurst handle any problems that
arise. And problems have arisen!

“At the Eastern Collegiates at
New l’altz l was rcfereeing at night
and nobody remembered that at

t0:t)0 the lights automatically slrttt
off. Needless to say at l0:00 that
night the tennis corrrts became pitch
black in the middle of the matches
being played. It was a disaster.
Players were giving me their scores
to rcrtrernbcr and [couldn't even see
the faces of the players. We ltad to
then wait an hour for the lights to
rcwnrm up." recalled Matrn of the
now humorous situation.

Albany's women's tcnrtis coach’s
referee/umpire abilities have taken
ltcr all over the world. According to
Mann, this has brought her one of
tthrills of her life. The

' thc trrrtpirc for a match involving

John McEnroe who "acted up, but
I put him irt his place," said Mann.
At that saute tournament Albany‘s
most famous rtrnpire was a line

Mann also trmpired in a tourna-

Mann's coaching approach is urt—
complicttted, if not a compromise
of what she would like to do. She
receives thclplayers to days before
the season starts and basically corr-
centrates on strategy — taking what
each player has and utilizing it.
“Most of my players have becrt
playing ten years when I get them.’?
adds Mann.

Since Coach Marin has been
Albany‘s only women's tennis
coach. she‘s also seen the changes
which have occurred over the years.

partly to the increased popularity of

Yet another crunch has recently
been prrl upon SUNY students. The
Governor‘s rcccttl budget vetos in-
cludc sonic siguilicrmt reductions irt
what the State Legislature passed as

necessary funding for SUNY
schools. .

Eliminated in the veto were $23
million for SUNY

and CUNY and int
additional $5
million for corn-
rnrrrtity colleges.

In essence “the governor vetoed
all tltc additions that the Legislature
made." strid SUNY Vice Chancellor

“We are now preparing to
operate within the funding

"We do rtot know what specific ef-
fects the veto will have, bttt we are
reviewing campus budgets and we
will reallocate funds if
appropriate."

“The cruel part of the veto is that it

Glaser.

SASU, said Glaser feels the state
is not keeping its commitment to
ensure the continued prosperity of
the SUNY system — a system which
SASU claims is the largest public
postsecondary education system in
.the.world.

“We are most concerned with the
cuts in financial aid." said Glaser.
“The faculty associations will fight

fighting for financial aid are the
