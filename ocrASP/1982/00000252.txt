Seven days filled with fun ac-
tivities. interspersed with tedious
finals characterize Senior Week.

But on those days when you are
free to party, Senior Class President
Jeff Shore says he and the 15
members of the Senior Class Coun-
cil worked hard to present a week of
enjoyable activities. beginning
Monday, May 17.

Montreal. Five hundred tickets

.werc sold for the daytime trip to

Boston. Fifteen hundred people
bought tickets for the Rafters.

The only activity where demand
signiﬁcantly exceeded tickets was
the clambake. Shore explained,
"Last year l400 tickets were sold.
so we planned to sell 1500 tickets
this year. A lot of people complain-
ed that they weren't able to pur-
chase tickets. so we ended up selling
1700 tickets. You can't have too

many people. because it would
overcrowd the buses. the
bathrooms. and the beer lines."
Shore added, "if anyone didn't get
tickets it's because they didn’t try."

Shore said the class of '82 funds
the Senior Week activities. “We
lose money," he claimed. "For in-
stance. on the Clambake tickets
we're losing $7.50 for every ticket
and we sold l700 tickets. The Coun-
cil of ’82 is supposed to have money
left over to go into the Alumni

Fund. so the'Admlnistration rim.

Funds for the Council of '82
comes from the $3.00 class dues
seniors have paid over the past four
years. Shore said the Council check-
ed every scnior's records for the Last
two years to make sure they paid
dues. If not. the students were not
issued a_ Senior Card. thereby
denied the privilege of buying
tickets to the activities at discount
prices. Also. seniors without senior
cards could not purchase their
tickets the first two days they were
on Sale.

Rothenberg are; “i feel i should
have the right to go becausej’m a
senior.” Shoi'e said the Council is
willing tickets to an additional
canoe trip on Sunday.

Waiting on line for tickets to ac-
tivities was the only problem for
some seniors. Lorl Galllcaro waited
on line for 8 hours and Ilene Unter- 4
man waited on line for 6 hours to
get tickets.

Most seniors are praying for
good weather. because as Unterman
said, "it‘s time to celebrate."

Newman’s Beer

bcorrlinued front page 5

Thatcher crew jokingly offered
sortie advice in regard to improving
tltc efficiency of the transaction:
“you need yousc some secretaries.
hch; yo, hand me that pitcher."

Newman claimed that his ale has
far better quality then other
American beers because of a
superior brewing process and the in-
tegrity of his ingredients. Newman
says Atnerican breweries com-
promise the quality of their beers in
order to meet the "middle of the
road" beer drinking tastes of most
Americans.

A sample of the beer proved '
palatable but the warm serving
temperature (an English tradition)
didn’t jibe quite right with the
taster’s perhaps. unrefined, maybe '
even crude, beer drinking tastes.

The SUNYA Rathskciler is now
serving Newman’s Pale Ale but so
far Newman is disappointed with
