“gtacc period" llttottgh February
28, 1982. during wlticlt tttcu who
hadn't registered on time could do
so without pcttalty.

The penalty for ttot tcgislcting is
up to ﬁve years itt prison, a $10,000
line, or bollt.

Soon after the gtace period cud-
ed. Reptescntalisc I.cs Aspin
(D—Wis) introduced a bill in,t‘on-
gress to make tum-registration a
misdemeanor with a maximum
penalty of $200.

In mid-March. Selective Service
Director Thomas Turnage endorsed
the Aspin plan, which Congress has
yet to consider ol'l'icially.

annngc said one reason for en-
dorsing the idea is that it would be
"impractical" to prosecute tltc
estimated 900,000 men who have
not registered since President Jim-
my ('at'ler started the program in
January, [980.

That includes the 450-somc peo-
ple wlto tegislcrcd with names like
"Mickey Mouse," “Bluto Billile-
sky,“ “Jimmy Carter." and
"Ronald Reagan," the GAO report
said.
